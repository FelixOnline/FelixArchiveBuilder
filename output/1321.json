As a result,\nstaff have decided to transform the present library into\na reading room, moving all\nbooks and collections to the\ncentral library.\nSpeaking on behalf of the\ncurrent \u2018council of professors\u2019\nthat runs the department,\nProfessor Peter Cawley told\nFelix: \u201cWe were placed in a\nsituation where we had no\nreading room, and that was\nour absolute priority. We\nconcluded that the present\nlibrary area was by far the\nmost suitable location. All the\nbooks will be moved to the\ncentral library, which as you\nknow has much longer opening hours than mechanical\nengineering, and so will be\naccessible during evenings\nand at weekends.\u201d\nThe library currently holds\nbooks, projects, exam papers\nand solutions in a convenient location. It is widely\nused, especially during exam\nperiods. A petition against its\nclosure, signed by over 400\nmechanical engineering stu-dents, was given to the head\nof department in January.\nStudents claimed that access\nto crucial materials would be\nlost in the central library, and\nstaff would not be able to provide the same level of specific\nadvice and service.\nHelen Dawson, the mechanical engineering department\nrepresentative, told Felix:\n\u201cThe students are gob-smacked that such an important resource in our department is being closed down,\nand it is a sore blow when we\nthought the library was saved\nfor now. No effort has been\nmade to move the library to\nunused store rooms in a bid\nto keep it.\u201d\nFelix understands that the\nclosure of the library was\nwidely supported by academ-ics, who believed it to be in\nstudents\u2019 best interests.\nProf Cawley said: \u201cI want to\nmake clear that our priority in discussing the future\nof the library area has been\nthe interests of students. We\nappreciatethatstudentsvalue\nthe services the departmental library offers and we will\nbe consulting students and\nstaff in the next few weeks on\nwhat they need.\u201d\nOne undergraduate in\nmechanical engineering,\nwho wished to remain anony-mous, told Felix: \u201cAnyone\nwould think that Mech Eng is\na business for wannabe politi-cians, not a university for the\neducation and stimulation of\nthe students.\u201d\n\u25cf Comment, page 4\nEnd of story for Mech Eng library\nFancy shifting those\nextra pounds?\nThen Join IC Fitness\nClub!\nWe offer fun classes with\nprofessional instructors in\naerobics, Pilates, Tae Bo,\nyoga and more\nVenue: Southside gym or Union gym\nCheap membership and classes\nClasses from \u00a31.50\nVisit our website for details & class timetable at\nhttp://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/fitness\nThe mechanical engineering department library is to be transformed into a reading\nroom. The books will be moved to the central library instead\nis unfair to leave Linstead\nstudents with no private\ncommunal space.\u201d The result:\nno Southside bar from summer 2005.\nMr Arif added: \u201cIf we moved\nit to Linstead, it would not\nbe the same Southside Bar\nanyway. It would be much\nsmaller, it would be on the\nfirst floor, it wouldn\u2019t have\nthe same atmosphere, and\nCollege were intending for\nthe Union to run it.\u201d\nThe closure of student bars\ndoes not stop with Southside\n\u2013 there are plans to close\nboth Weeks and Linstead\nbars too. This change also\nappears to stem from views\nexpressed by the Union. Mr\nMitcheson states: \u201cICU have\nexpressed the view that there\nis over-capacity in bars in\nthe College and that the closure of the Linstead bar and\nthe bar in Weeks Hall, with\nthe refurbishment of both as\nsocial spaces, is to be pre-ferred. The College has no\nobjection to this and is now\nproposing to go ahead on this\nbasis.\u201d\nNo indoor sports\nfacilities\nThere will be no sports facilities in Princes Gardens for\nthe duration of the autumn\nterm next year. This will give\nImperial the dubious honour\nof being the only major university in the country without a fitness gym on campus.\nThe problem arises because\nthe new sports centre will not\nopen until January, having\nbeen delayed for four months,\nand the current fitness gym\nin Southside will have been\ndemolished.\nThe College and Union\nare currently in negotiations\nwith Fitness First in South\nKensington with regard to\na reduced membership rate\nfor students and a possible\nCollege subsidy. Student\nclubs and activities requiring\na sports hall are likely to be\nhelped to find alternative venues and/or reimbursed the\ncost of travelling to Wilson\nHouse.\nReduced communal\nareas\nThe new Southside halls are\nto have 70 more rooms and yet\nthe building will be reduced\nin height by three storeys.\nAs a result, something has\nto give. The main casualties,\naside from Southside Bar, will\nbe communal areas.\nSurprisingly, given prevailing student opinion that there\nare already too many people\nper kitchen, the plans are for\nonly one kitchen per floor per\nhall. This could lead to up\nto 30 people using the same\nkitchen. The kitchens are\nplanned to double as communal areas with sofas and\ntelevisions.\nStudents to be\nre-housed\nDue to reduced capacity, the\nCollege plans to house students in private accommodation while Southside is being\nrebuilt. The students will be\nhoused in hall-type accommodation run by UNITE\nHousing.\nUNITE featured in the\nnational press in October\n2003, when students from the\nUniversity of Liverpool and\nJohn Moores University experienced continuous problems\nincluding leaks, a lack of hot\nwater and builders walking\ninto their rooms while they\nwere still in bed.\nImperial plans to lease\nwhole sections of UNITE\u2019s\naccommodation and run\nthem like Imperial-owned\nhalls with their own warden,\nsub-warden and re-apps.\nHowever, the UNITE properties are far from conveniently\nsituated for travel to Imperial\n\u2013 Orient House is close to\nChelsea Wharf in Fulham,\nand Piccadilly Court is in\nnortheast London.\nThe College plans to charge\napproximately equal rates to\nthose charged for Imperialowned accommodation,\nminus the cost of the necessary travelcard.\nLinstead will no longer\nbe catered\nThe College\u2019s catering review\nhas recommended that a\nshop or caf\u00e9 outlet is needed\nin Princes Gardens during\nthe Southside construction\nproject.\nMr Mitcheson said: \u201cThe\nCollege is proposing to convert the present Linstead\nHall dining room into a shop\nand cafe. Linstead would then\nno longer be a catered hall\nand arrangements would be\nmade to ensure that those\nresident in it would not be\ndisadvantaged by this.\u201d\nHowever, Linstead is\nImperial\u2019s last remaining\ncatered hall, with some 9%\nof students listing it as \u201cvery\nimportant\u201d in the Union\u2019s\n\u2018Your Say\u2019 survey.\nSide effects of Southside rebuild\n\u25cf Continued from page 1\nSouthside: set for demolition this summer\n\n"

What sort\nof social routine leads to 38\nbookshops in a small village\nin a singularly remote corner\nof the world? The Imperial\nCollege Science Fiction\nSociety (ICSF) organised a\nroad trip there, in an attempt\nto bring you the answer to this\nand other mysteries, and also\nto buy books for our library.\nThe day started in a very\nunusual manner, as the 12\nmembers of the party met in\nthe right place at the right\ntime and set off on their journeys ahead of schedule. After\nfour hours, we all managed\nto meet again in Hay-on-Wye\nwithout too much lasting\nbrain damage from in-car\nstereos.\nAfter finding our Bed and\nBreakfasts and some food, we\nset on to explore the wonderful world of second\u2013hand\nbookshops.\nThe type of bookshop varied across the town, from\nspecialised bookshops to the\namusing Castle bookshop,\nwith its shelves of chaos and\namusing books, and the box\nto pay for your books (50p\nfor hardbacks and 30p for\npaperbacks!) It was here that\nwe found some of the jewels\nof our trip, especially Two\u2019s\nCompany, Three\u2019s A Swing\nwhich managed to shock everyone in the random three\npage test, and The Bluffer\u2019s\nGuide To University with its\nall-too-familiar descriptions\nof our own lives.\nAfter an afternoon of rather\nsilly book\u2013shopping, we found\nourselves without a purpose,\nand we headed on to the pub.\nThere we indulged ourselves\nin some celebration drinking.\nAs our conversations dangerously shifted from random\ntrip talk to uni talk, each of us\nwere one by one forbidden to\ntalk about our respective sub-jects, creating a serious strain\non both the geeks amongst us\nand their livers.\nDespite a late night and\nsome problems with the sleep\narrangements (for example,\ntwo of us being locked out\nof their B&B), we all managed to meet again at 10am\nto carry on. It was here that\na new member joined our\nparty: a two metre long pink\nand blue fluffy snake.\nThis is a small town, and\nhere we were, 12 Imperial\nstudents, poring over books,\nbuying science fiction and\ncarrying a pink snake. We\nwere asked questions...\nArmed with maps and\ndetermination, we managed\nto visit most of the book-shops, including the cinema.\nHay-on-Wye is a place crazy\nenough to turn its cinema and\nits fire station into bookshops;\nbecause, of course, who needs\na fire station in a village made\nout of books?\nAmongst some of our best\nacquisitions, you can find\ntitles from Brian Aldiss, Neil\nGaiman and Tom Holt.\nOn leaving, we provided\nlocal entertainment when we\ntried to fit about 50 books and\na gigantic pink snake into the\nalready over-filled boots of\ntwo very small cars. Don\u2019t try\nthis at home, kids.\nIf you want to see the pink\nsnake or read our new books,\nyou can find them in the ICSF\nlibrary (west wing basement,\nBeit Quad) pretty much\nany time of the day.

After telling his older brother Rocky (Trevor\nMorgan) what happened, the group\nof friends resolve to teach George\na lesson, although Sammy will only\nagree to it if the boys come up with\na plan that doesn\u2019t physically hurt\nGeorge.\nSo they do; but the reason why\neach person wants to be involved in\nthis is very murky. Rocky calls up\nGeorge to invite him to his brother\u2019s non-existent birthday party \u2013 I\nguess it\u2019s not that hard to imagine a\nboy with no friends readily jumping\nat the chance of going, even though\nhe\u2019d pulverised Sammy the other\nday. Running alongside this storyline is Sammy and Millie\u2019s blossoming relationship. The first date\nhappens to coincide with boat party,\nwhich Millie knows nothing about.\nAfter Millie forces Sammy to\nexplain what\u2019s going on, she makes\nhim promise to stop the plan \u2013 it\u2019s\ntoo mean and George actually seems\nto be OK once you get to know him.\nThe only thing you can fault him\nfor on the trip is trying to impress\nMarty. He essentially wants what\neveryone else wants \u2013 to be accept-ed. The rest of the group agree to\ndrop the plan, some more readily\nthan others, but Marty doesn\u2019t seem\nto want to let it go.\nThe boat trip caries on, but George\nkeeps pushing all the wrong but-tons. It\u2019s as if the boy has verbal\ndiarrhoea and just doesn\u2019t know\nwhen to stop. In fact, he pushes\nso many buttons that Millie, the\ngroup\u2019s moral compass, allows the\nboys to carry on with the plan \u2013 a\ngame of Truth or Dare. All starts out\nfine, but soon the game spirals out\nof control and George finds out what\nthey want to do to him. Terrible and\npainful secrets are unleashed on\nthe group.\nThe friends are left to deal with\nthe powerful lifelong consequences\nas their loyalty to each other is put\nto the test. I really wish I could tell\nyou what happens but that would be\nspoiling it if you go, and believe me,\nyou should.\nMean Creek is a stereotypical\nindie film, but in the best way possible \u2013 it looks ordinary but is actually\nan amazing find, quite literally since\nit doesn\u2019t seem to be playing in most\ncinemas. The director has used a\nmix between film photography and\nhome video, which becomes more\nimportant towards the end when\nwe see George\u2019s perspective on life.\nUsing hand-held camera and natural light, director of photography\nSharone Meir gets the sun-dappled\ngreenery of a perfect summertime\nday. The music is fantastic and\nmatches that dirty, downbeat, low-key look of the film.\nThe acting shines out \u2013 everyone\ndelivers great performances, especially Carly Schroeder (Millie) and\nScott Mechlowicz (Marty), who just\nstand out. The storyline isn\u2019t too\ntaxing on the mind either but it is\na brilliant script \u2013 the characters\nare complex and the relationships\nare well-developed. The film really\nbegins to shine when the characters\nrealise that everything isn\u2019t always\nblack and white but more likely several shades of grey.\nI know that there a quite a few\nbig films out at the moment, but\nthis really is perfect for a sunny\nafternoon or evening this summer.\nIf you\u2019ve never seen an indie film\nbefore, this is good one to start off\nwith.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 5 May 2005\n6\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nWhat the bleep do they know?\nA documentary about quantum physics, psychology and spirituality has become a huge US box office hit.\nThought-provoking entertainment, or dangerous abuse of science? Edmund Hunt knows where he stands\nLast Thursday, ICU Cinema hosted a\nfree preview screening of What The\nBleep Do We Know? which I attended\nwith a couple of my friends. We were\nhappy to take advantage of the offer\nof a free movie, and the film promised to be a Horizon-style discussion\nof purported links between science\nand spirituality. Unfortunately it\nturned out to be sinister propaganda\nfor a bizarre New Age cult called the\n\u2018Ramtha School of Enlightenment\u2019. I\nwould urge people not to pay money\nto see this film, because if you do,\nyou are unwittingly enriching some\nvery shady characters.\nThe movie follows the narrative of\na photographer, containing such perennial human musings as the meaning and purpose of life, control over\none\u2019s future, and her problems with\na distorted self-image. So far, so fair.\nHowever, it\u2019s interspersed with comments from \u2018scientific experts\u2019 and\nsuch luminaries as a failed Catholic\ntheologian and a cult leader claiming\nto be a channel for a 35,000-year-old\nwarrior spirit.\nMost of the film is simply a deluge\nof high-speed computer graphics\nand meaningless phrases, designed\nto wow the audience into thinking\nsomething new and profound is\nbeing said. However, it\u2019s really a\nhalf-baked concoction of ideas from\nhumanist psychology, misrepresented quantum physics and fuzzy New\nAge thinking about the nature of\nconsciousness. To be fair, I suppose\nthe film is somewhat entertaining, in\nthe same way that watching a bellowing televangelist makes you chuckle:\nthese people really do believe their\nown hype.\nWe were privileged to have one of\nthe talking heads in the film, Fred\nWolf, come and do a Q&A at the end\nof the showing. Unfortunately, his\nhypocrisy \u2013 urging us to be \u2018openminded\u2019 in one breath, mocking\nthose with serious questions about\nthe film\u2019s poor science in the next \u2013\nreally left a bitter taste in the mouth.\nIt ought to remind us that even PhDs\naren\u2019t immune from arrogance and\nself-delusion.\nNow, believe me, I\u2019m not against\nan open discussion about spirituality \u2013 philosophies on the nature of\nreality from the likes of Plato and\nBuddha are fascinating and thought-provoking. Indeed, I think an awareness of them is beneficial to the\nthoughtful scientist. But what\u2019s dangerous about this film is the way\nit contains some genuine science\nand some sensible attitudes \u2013 giving it the veneer of respectability\n\u2013 and then proceeds from there to\nmake completely unjustified, unexplained and unfalsifiable conjectures\nthat are presented as scientifically-endorsed fact.\nAlas, the filmmakers seem to have\nlittle time for such quaint concepts\nas measurable results and scientific proof. The theory of quantum\nmechanics does provide for such\nstartling ideas as quantum superpo-sition, where a quantity may take on\nseveral values until observed, when\nit will be \u2018collapsed\u2019 onto one of the\npossible values. However, the filmmakers take this idea and interpret\nit as humans literally creating reality with the power of their conscious\nthoughts. From here we get to such\nwacky self-help notions as \u2018create\nyour own day\u2019, recognizing your own\n\u2018god-like power\u2019. Now, encouraging\npositive thinking is to be applauded,\nbut telling people that they can walk\non water if they \u2018really believe it\u2019\nstrikes me as a little disingenuous,\nto say the least.\nRegrettably, Bleep may be a popular release in Britain. I think it\u2019s\na duty of the scientific community\n\u2013 especially those at such respected\nschools as Imperial \u2013 to speak out\nagainst the aggressive, intentional\nmisuse and misrepresentation of\nscience. We mustn\u2019t be unwitting\nstooges of cultists; one of the physicists quoted in the film, David Albert\nfrom Columbia University, claims\nhis views were \u201cradically misrepresented\u201d through selective editing of\nhis interview. We need to be vigilant\nand proactive in explaining to the\nunwitting public what theories like\nquantum mechanics do, do not and\ncannot entail for our world-view as\nconscious beings.\nWith quantum mechanics becomingpopularbuzzwordsinthewest,it\u2019s\nclearly going to be an uphill struggle\nto explain the necessary limitations\n\u2013 and remarkable explanatory power\n\u2013 of the scientific method. However,\nif science sits idly by while society is\ninfected with misleading ideas about\nits work, all humankind will suffer.\nWell, all except perhaps the likes of\nthe Ramtha leader, who has already\nmade her millions.\n\u25cf Edmund Hunt is a physics\nundergraduate\nStop the terror trade\nMaya Chowdhury, of Imperial\u2019s Amnesty Society, argues for tighter worldwide gun control laws\n\u201cOne day we argued. I was with\nsome other people, planting veg-etables, and he shot me through\nthe leg... Then he shot me through\nthe chest, and the third bullet just\nskimmed my hair, it was so close...\u201d\nThese are the words of Yem Para,\nfrom Phnom Penh, Cambodia, who\nwas viciously gunned down outside\nher home following a disagreement\nwith someone she knew.\n\u201cAt first everyone was afraid to\nintervene, but when he\u2019d finished\nthe rounds, the neighbours came\nand stopped him bashing me with\nthe butt of the gun. I still get pain\nfrom my wounds. And now I can only\ndo about half what I used to.\u201d\nCovert arms shipments from China\nand the USA to Cambodia\u2019s anti-Vietnamese factions started arriving\nin the 1970s. An estimated 500,000\nsmall arms are believed to remain\nin Cambodia \u2013 half of them controlled by the official military and police\nforces and the other half unaccount-ed for. Yem Pera\u2019s case simply highlights the tip of an iceberg affecting\nthe entire global community.\nThere are in the region of 639\nmillion small arms and light weapons worldwide today. Every year,\napproximately 500,000 men, women,\nand children are killed by armed\nviolence worldwide \u2013 that equates to\none person being slaughtered every\nminute. A further eight million more\narms are produced each year, serving only to add to the misery and\nhorrors resulting from armed vio-lence. It is estimated that, by 2020,\nthe amount of fatalities and injuries\nfrom war and violence will surpass\nthe number of deaths caused by\ninfectious diseases such as malaria.\nThe unregulated flow of arms\nallows criminals to unleash their\nbutchery and makes it easy for soldiers and police to murder arbitrar-ily. Although illicit wartime killings\nare a cause for concern, soldiers,\nparamilitaries and police are also\nmisusing military gear to commit\nterrible atrocities against civilians\nduring peacetime.\nIn the absence of sufficient control\nof the arms industry and without\nmeasures to protect people from\ntheir misuse, the unregulated arms\ntrade will continue to be the trigger\nof a tirade of catastrophic tragedies.\nEasily obtainable weapons will only\nhelp more violent crimes to occur.\nGreater numbers of people will be\nforced to flee their homes and abandon their livelihoods in an attempt to\nescape brutality. The vicious cycle of\nhuman rights abuses, suffering and\npoverty will continue.\nGun control is currently in the\nhands of national governments.\nUnfortunately, their legislation and\nauthority is too frequently inadequate to command reasonable arms\ncontrol. Amnesty International takes\nthe stance that an international arms\ntrade treaty is required to overcome\nthe carnage caused by unregulated\narms commerce and use. Such a\ntreaty would create legally binding\ngun controls and ensure that all governments control arms to the same\nbasic international standards.\nKofi Annan, the Secretary General\nof the United Nations, justified his\nsupport for such a treaty when he\nexplained that \u201cthe excessive accumulation and illicit trade of small\narms is threatening international\npeace and security, dashing hopes\nfor social and economic develop-ment, and jeopardizing prospects for\ndemocracy and human rights\u201d.\nIn spite of this view, and perhaps\nunsurprisingly, much of the blame\nfor unregulated arms trading can be\nplaced at the doors of the five permanent members of the UN Security\nCouncil. The UK, US, France, Russia\nand China account for up to 80% of\nreported arms exports. From 1998\nto 2001, the US, UK and France\nsecured a greater income from the\nsales of arms to developing countries than the total amount of aid\nthey donated to them.\nPoliticians in this country are well\naware of the problem of arms con-trol, as can be outlined by Norman\nLamb MP: \u201cThe Government has\nbeen hypocritical on this issue...\nand British companies are profiting from it. There\u2019s blood on the\nGovernment\u2019s hands over this.\u201d\nSimilarly, in the US, former\nPresident Jimmy Carter complains:\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have it both ways. We can\u2019t\nbe both the world\u2019s leading champion of peace and the world\u2019s leading\nsupplier of arms.\u201d\nClearly the public needs to show its\nsupport for greater gun control and\nhelp to apply pressure on the government to encourage such action.\nSimilar public drives over political\nissues have been successful, for\nexample in banning landmines and\ncancelling third world debt.\nAmnesty International has\nlaunched a Million Faces petition\ncampaign in conjunction with Oxfam\nandtheInternationalActionNetwork\non Small Arms in an attempt to\nshow the international governing\nbodies that there is a great public\ndemand for tighter gun control. It\nis hoped that if one million people\njoin the petition before the next UN\narms conference in 2006, sufficient\npressure will have been applied to\nensure the adoption of an international arms treaty and better gun\ncontrol. The campaign was launched\na year ago and already has the support of over 225,000 people world-wide. It is vital that the targets are\nmet to highlight the world\u2019s largest\npopular movement against the misuse of arms.\nFor more information, or to add\nyour name to the Million Faces peti-tion, visit www.controlarms.org.\nAlternatively, come along to Imperial\nCollege\u2019s Amnesty International\ngroup meetings in the Union on\nWednesday lunchtimes where this\nand other human rights abuses\nare discussed.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 5 May 2005 5\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nEmissions trading: is it the answer?\nUnder emissions trading agreements, will the environment become just another commodity to be\nbought and sold? Simon Bennett investigates\nIt will not have escaped the attention\nof Felix readers that climate change\nand environmental issues have\nrecently been receiving increased\nlevels of publicity. Responsibility for\nthis appears to rest with the Kyoto\nprotocol and the precarious balance\nof climate change issues at the top\nof Tony Blair\u2019s G8 agenda. Both are\nadmirable political efforts. Both will\nbe severely compromised by their\npolitical basis (see Felix 1319, \u2018Oh,\nKyoto! What a Complete Farce\u2019 by\nRichard Fenning).\nFor all the excited talk about Kyoto,\nit is sad that perhaps its greatest\nstrength as an emissions reducer is\nlikely to ultimately undermine the\naccomplishment of the task. I refer\nto emissions trading. By trading permits for greenhouse gas emissions,\nit draws nations down a route of\nenvironmental valuation. A scheme\nthat encourages profiteering from\nenvironmental protection makes the\nenvironment seem like just another\nresource to be accounted for on the\nbalance sheet. It is a vital progression away from not accounting for\nenvironmental impacts at all, but\ndoes this solution take our worldview\ncloser, or further away, from one that\nis harmonious with nature?\nThe premise of the Kyoto and\nEU Emissions Trading Schemes is\nthat the current prevailing belief\nsystem of capitalist economics has\nnot been sufficiently valuing environmental impacts (see Felix 1318,\n\u2018Cutting Carbon Under Kyoto\u2019). As\na result, it is more profitable to pollute than to invest in abatement if\nthe environmental detriment does\nnot directly harm the polluter\u2019s cash\nflow. Essentially, a dualist approach\nthat separates human operations\nfrom environmental considerations\nexists. A permit trading scheme\noffers a method of attempting to\nmake the polluter pay for damage\ncaused. However, the outcome of\nsuch a system is not one in which the\npolluters will pay full compensation\nfor the casualties of their actions.\nThe outcome is that the overall level\nof pollution by all polluters is merely\nreduced by an amount dictated by\nthe number of permits allocated. No\ncompensation is ever received by\ninjured parties and the allocation is\nmade on a political basis.\nDespite this, tradable permits\ncan be effective at reducing emis-sions, as shown by the US Acid Rain\nProgram. Emissions reductions\nare essential if we are to seriously\naddress climate change, and mar-ket-based methods are politically\nfriendly since neither taxpayers nor\ngovernments are especially financially burdened. Political sensitivities may have more impact on the\nendorsement of Domestic Tradable\nQuotas as proposed by the Tyndale\nCentre\u2019s research programme. If all\nthe inhabitants of the earth were\nallocated a tradable carbon quota\nthen climate-friendly behaviour\nwould result. Or would it?\nIf the problem is that a dualist\nbelief system has become domi-nant, in which nature and human\nbehaviour are regarded independ-ently, then it should be this that is\naddressed. Pricing the environment\nmakes our behaviour become even\nmore about the immediate needs\nof the human race, promoting the\nimpression that the environment\nexists for our benefit. This echoes\nthe biblical instruction that man\nshall have \u201cdominion over the works\nof [God\u2019s] hands\u201d. It also suggests\nthat we can control nature through\ntechnological change. In the wake\nof recent natural disasters, this\nappears further away than ever.\nBut the inference is not diminished\nby the presence within many companies of environmental managers, a\ntitle that compounds the impression that environmental improvement is the product of control and\nmanagement of nature. Imperial\nCollege itself may soon have its own\nEnvironmental Manager and many\ngraduates of Imperial\u2019s prestigious\nMSc in Environmental Technology\nmay go on to take up such roles.\nIndeed,manygraduatesofthecourse\nwill land some very influential positions having been indoctrinated by\nthe potential successes of economic\nsolutions such as emissions trading,\nbut having been given no debate on\nthe fundamental implications. Is it\nreally possible to assume that the\nsolution can be found within the\nvery model that is responsible for\nthe problem of dangerous pollution\nlevels? Such levels are side-effects\nof the pursuit of technology to fuel\neconomic growth, a process that has\nso far only served to concentrate\npower in the hands of those with the\nleast regard for our environmental\nlegacy.\nSo as we enter what appears to\nbe an inevitable era of employing\nmarkets to address environmental\nissues, we should all be asking ourselves a few vital questions:\nIs the introduction of globally-backed, market-based measures\na genuine cause for celebration?\nAmending the problems of the current system by introducing fixes that\nplace a value on the environment\nwill primarily benefit those who can\nafford to buy their slice of nature.\nThe rest of the world will become the\nmost burdened, as it compensates\nfor such behaviour, doing nothing to\nimprove our fundamental relationship with our environment. Whilst\ntradable permits have been shown\nto be effective emissions reducers,\nthey are inherently limited in scope.\nWe should continue to look beyond\nthese measures and not be scared\nof looking outside the current sys-tem. Effective policies that address\nthe behavioural causes of needless\ncarbon emissions might not be complimentary to existing structures.\nAre we really addressing the problem or merely the symptoms? Coexistence with a healthy biosphere\nsurely demands that we live within\nthat biosphere and consider ourselves to be one powerful component of the planet\u2019s biodiversity.\nThis means questioning whether\nour measures serve to ingrain dualist philosophies that encourage the\nbelief that we can ultimately \u2018win\u2019\nthe battle with nature. The problem\nmay not strictly be that we are not\nvaluing the environment, but that\nwe are using the wrong system of\nvaluation to make decisions about\nthe world\u2019s future.\nDoes the current environmental\neducation system see the field too\nnarrowly? By working closely with\nthe main current employers in the\nfield, students are being equipped\nto succeed within the current political and economic paradigm. It may,\nhowever, prove equally important to\neducate students in the fundamental\nfailings of the system and the need\nfor longer-term solutions.\nThese are merely concerns to be\naccounted for when considering the\nclaims about Kyoto. If radical changes are threatened, are intrinsically\nincremental measures good enough,\nor are we consigning ourselves to\ntinkering at the edges of the problem before we\u2019ve even started to\naddress it?\n\u25cf Simon Bennett is an MSc\nstudent of environmental\ntechnology\nThe insidious effects of intellectual\nproperty rights\nBy Jamie Brothwell\nImperial College Student Pugwash\nThe belief that intellectual property rights have little impact on people\u2019s lives is an extremely dangerous public misconception. Are you\naware that patents make vital medicines inaccessible to the people who\nneed them most? Or that 95% of\ncopyrighted works are no longer\navailable? Do you know the crisis\nyour own library faces because of\nthe increased commercialisation of\nacademic publishing, and can you\nimagine how much worse things\nare for libraries in developing\ncountries?\nLast term, Rufus Pollock, director\nof the Open Knowledge Foundation,\ngave a talk addressing these issues,\nhosted by the Student Pugwash\nSociety. He highlighted the radical new possibilities for equitable\ninformation-sharing that have arisen with the internet, as well the\never-increasing global regime of\nintellectual property protection that\nthreatens them.\nCoders and hackers who use open\nsource software are acutely aware\nof the threat from inappropriate\napplications of intellectual property\n\u2013 the proposed European Software\nDirective could lay free systems\nsuch as Linux open to a flood of\nlitigation.\nEnvironmentalists, on the other\nhand, or those who campaign for a\nfairer deal for developing nations,\nare often unaware of the all-per-vasive effects of \u2018intellectual property\u2019. There is a great deal of\ndebate over the rights and wrongs\nof the World Trade Organisation,\nbut when did you last hear about\nthe World Intellectual Property\nOrganisation? Away from the public gaze, they are implementing a\nprogramme of harmonisation that\nhas recently led India to outlaw the\nproduction of generic medicines.\nCurrently, India supplies 60% of\nthe generic AIDS drugs used in\nAfrica.\nThe Open Knowledge Foundation\n(OKF) exists to promote awareness of these issues, to campaign\nfor fairer legislation and to foster\nprojects that use the principles of\nopen access to information. The\nOKF will be back at Imperial at the\nstart of the next academic year, talking and orchestrating a campaign\nto increase access to academic literature \u2013 an issue that affects each\nand every one of us.

Thefts from halls of resi-dence, problems with bicycle parking and a less than perfect relationship between students and security\nstaff are just some of the issues that\nhave been brought to our attention.\n\u201cI would like security to be seen\nas a help, not a hindrance,\u201d says\nDiana Pinn, who holds much of the\nresponsibility for finding a suitable\nbalance between security and freedom on campus. Formerly in charge\nof administration at Cazenove, an\ninvestment bank in the City, she is\nnow Assistant Director of Estates at\nImperial College and took responsibility for security in August last\nyear.\nShe describes Imperial College as\n\u201cfascinating... like a mini-town,\u201d and\nbelieves that security officers have\nchallenging roles to play within that\ncommunity.\n\u201cWhat has surprised me is the\nsheer breadth of the role they [secu-rity officers] have to deal with. They\nhave to be nannies for some of the\nstudents who are away from home\nfor the first time, they have to be\nreceptionists, they have to be first-aiders, they have to be quasi-par-ents on occasion.\n\u201cStudents do some amazingly\nstupid things, in terms of money\nand carelessness. If they\u2019ve just\nleft home and had parents looking\nafter them, they\u2019ve never had to\nthink, and from that point of view it\u2019s\nincredible what the security guards\nare having to deal with.\u201d\nIt surprises me to discover that\nno prior training, experience or\nqualifications are required for these\nchallenging roles.\n\u201cTo work here, they [security\nofficers] have to have a ten year\ncheckable work history for criminal\nrecords,\u201d says Pinn. \u201cInevitably, not\nall of them have had security expe-rience, but if they\u2019ve got common\nsense and a good attitude they can\nbe trained.\u201d\nTerry Branch, the Chief Security\nOfficer (Operations), has been working at Imperial for four years. He\njoins the interview late, having been\ncalled away to an incident in the\nRoyal School of Mines building.\nBranch thinks the relationship\nbetween students and security officers has changed during his time\nhere: \u201cI believe we\u2019ve improved\nupon it. There are some individuals\nwho get on much better with the\nstudents than others and who have\nbuilt up a good relationship. And\nwe\u2019re trying to improve the other\nones through good training.\n\u201cDealing with students, we really\nhave to be on the ball. We\u2019ve all\nbeen there... if a student\u2019s had a bit\nto drink, you\u2019ve got to understand\nthat, as long as they don\u2019t overstep\nthe mark, a quiet word is always\nbetter.\u201d\nSome security guards at Imperial\nwork shifts lasting 12 or 14 hours\neach. Can they really be effective\nunder those conditions?\n\u201cYes, I believe they can,\u201d says\nBranch confidently. \u201cThere are a lot\nof big shifts across the board now,\nbut we\u2019re trying to gradually reduce\nthem. It\u2019s not as if they\u2019re patrolling all through the night without a\nbreak.\u201d\n\u201cOn paper,\u201d Pinn chips in, \u201cone\nof the difficulties is to make sure\nthey\u2019ve got things to do and they\u2019re\nkept awake.\u201d\nIndeed, keeping staff awake overnight seems to be a more difficult\ntask than it sounds. Having lived\nand worked in Beit Quad, I\u2019ve now\nlost count of the number of times\nI\u2019ve seen a security guard asleep\non duty. Needless to say, their superiors insist that such behaviour is\n\u201ctaken very seriously\u201d.\n\u201cOne officer was reported [asleep]\nby a student, and he\u2019s no longer\nwith us,\u201d says Branch. \u201cHe was dis-missed. Two have been dismissed\nfor that since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re paid to be there, awake\nand doing the job,\u201d adds Pinn. \u201cIf\nyou see it, ring control and tell them.\nThey will be disciplined.\u201d\nFollowing up on numerous complaints from security officers them-selves, I asked why hats \u2013 described\nas \u201ccheap imitation police caps\u201d by\nUnion President Mustafa Arif \u2013 had\nbeen introduced as part of their\nuniform.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like them myself,\u201d admits\nBranch, \u201cbut I believe the Rector\nwanted us to have a higher profile\nand make us stand out.\u201d\nPinn enthusiastically supports the\nuniform: \u201cI believe that a hat or cap\ncontributes to the overall professional smart look and can also give a\nguard confidence in dealing with an\nincident. It gives them a status and\nstature in terms of appearance that\nhelps them carry out the job.\u201d\nIdentity cards\nWriting in Felix in December, the\nUnion President called College\nsecurity \u201cintrusive\u201d and \u201cunsettling\u201d. Amongst other things, he\nquestioned whether students should\nhave to wear identity cards at all\ntimes.\nIs it necessary? Pinn thinks so, as\nit would help to eliminate the problem of \u2018tailgating\u2019 at swipe doors:\n\u201cI would like people to wear ID\ncards because if somebody comes\nin behind you and they\u2019ve got an ID\ncard, you don\u2019t have to embarrass\nyourself by asking whether they\nshould be there.\n\u201cBut equally I understand there\u2019s\nno way we can enforce it when senior academics and staff would refuse\nto wear them.\u201d\nShe commends the Civil\nEngineering department for their\n\u2018wear your ID card at all times\u2019\npolicy, and says she has no problem\nwith the Business School asking for\nTHE FELIX INTERVIEW\nTerry Branch (left) and Diana Pinn (centre), with Dave Edwards\n\u201cI would like people\nto wear ID cards at\nall times... but there\u2019s\nno way we can\nenforce it\u201d\n\u201cThere were efforts\nto concentrate bike\nparking in certain\nareas and make them\nas secure as possible\u201d\nPHOTO: SIMON CLARK\n\n"

    "content": "This being a science college, I\u2019m\nsure most of us are familiar with\nthe story of The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide\nto the Galaxy. Unfortunately, this\nis not it.\nPrevious incarnations of the\nGuide include successful radio and\nTV series and a trilogy of five popular books that define that \u2018sci-fi-comedy-adventure\u2019 genre. Whilst it is\nnot unusual for the stories to differ\nbetween media, the latest film starring Martin Freeman as the hapless\nearthman Arthur Dent takes this\nidea to a new level.\nAs with all versions, the film\nbegins with the now classic juxtaposition of Dent\u2019s irritation when his\nhouse is bulldozed one morning in\nthe name of transport improvement\nwith his disbelief when his planet\nmeets a similar fate later that afternoon at the hands of the Vogons.\nHaving hitched a lift on a spaceship,\na strange journey throughout the\ngalaxy ensues, punctuated variously by encounters with a depressed\nrobot, a two-headed galactic president and some hyper-intelligent\nmice with only a towel for protec-tion. As Arthur puts it, \u201cThis must\nbe Thursday. I never could get the\nhang of Thursdays.\u201d\nAlongside all this, we learn about\nthe indispensable electronic reference book, the The Hitchhiker\u2019s\nGuide to the Galaxy, which guides\nus through all that tricky alien interaction stuff.\nSounds like the story we all know\nand love, doesn\u2019t it? Think again.\n\u2018Love\u2019 is the key word here, as unfortunately vast swathes of humour\nhave been replaced by a dull love\nstory, as scenes of Arthur rescuing\na inappropriately American Tricia\nMcMillan (Zooey Deschanel) are\nthrown in, purely for Hollywood\neffect. The books are well known\nfor their cynical British humour, but\nnone of the characteristic pessimism\nso beautifully portrayed by Simon\nJones in the Radio and TV series\ncomes through, despite Freeman\u2019s\nbest attempts. (Jones, incidentally,\nmakes a brief cameo for the fans.)\nBoth Ford (Mos Def) and Zaphod\n(Sam Rockwell) sport uncharacteristic American accents that simply don\u2019t suit the dialogue. A poor\nattempt at incorporating Zaphod\u2019s\nextra head even inspires fondness\nfor the technologically devoid TV\nseries.\nFortunately, there are one or\ntwo saving graces that prevent a\nfan from leaving halfway through.\nStephen Fry\u2019s efforts at following\non from the legendary Peter Jones\nare pleasing, coupled with the entertaining animations the book produces to explain parts of the film.\nAlan Rickman\u2019s portrayal of Marvin,\nthe paranoid android, was effective,\nand the improvements in computer graphics did wonders for his\nrange of expression. Bill Nighy also\nmakes a reasonable interpretation\nof Slartibartfast.\nAside from a few positive add-ins,\nthis film was generally a disappoint-ment. At 110 minutes, there shouldn\u2019t\nhave been a need to cut out such\nlarge portions of good material from\nthe originals, and it all leads to a film\nthat will appear even more stilted\nand bizarre to those who haven\u2019t\nread the books. Particularly sorely\nmissed were the \u2018Restaurant at the\nEnd of the Universe\u2019 scene and the\n\u2018proof\u2019 that God doesn\u2019t exist. In\ngeneral, highlights were few and far-between, so only go if you already\nknow where your towel is, and be\nprepared for the worst. If you\u2019ve\nnever heard of it, don\u2019t bother: it\u2019s\na confusing, Hollywood-ised, feeble\nimitation of the original.\nMartin Smith and\nJenny Chambers\nThumbs down to the hitchhiker\nMy babelfish must be malfunctioning, this sounds like American crap\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 5 May 2005\n16\nThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide\nTo The Galaxy\nDirector: Garth Jennings\nStarring: Martin Freeman, Sam\nRockwell, Mos Def, John Malkovich,\nZooey Deschanel\nRunning time: 110 mins\nCertificate: PG\nHHIII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nR2D2 has competition in the world of robotic cinema stars\nAs if this movie needs any more hype!\nStar Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of\nthe Sith, the most eagerly awaited\nfilm of the summer, has a lot to live\nup to.\nThe creative genius of George\nLucas might have started out with a\ndeceptively simple story of a smuggler and a farm boy out to save\na princess. However, it has since\ndeveloped into a rich tale of love,\nmagic, scandal that ultimately leads\nto the destruction and then construction of a new world order.\nIn Episodes I and II, we have\nwitnessed how Anakin Skywalker\n(Hayden Christensen) was rescued\nfrom slavery in Tatooine to become\nthe delicious, headstrong and talented young Jedi that he is today.\nHowever, followers of the \u2018Force\u2019\nwill know from Episodes IV, V and\nVI that Anakin will turn into the\nmuch-feared villain Darth Vader.\nTherefore, Episode III will serve\nas the missing link in the Star Wars\nseries.\nEvery drop of adulation we ever\nhad for the young Jedi will be\ncrushed as we witness his transformation from a pure and good-looking\nyoung man into an asthmatic-sound-ing, evil metal-suited Darth Vader.\nNevertheless, we have to hope that\nHayden Christensen\u2019s rigid acting\nskills have since improved with age,\nas this flaw was one of the major\ndisappointments in Episode II.\nIn Episode II, we witnessed how\nthe Republic achieved victory\nagainst the Separatists. As Yoda had\nwisely mentioned, it was not a true\nvictory because it had strengthened\nSupreme Chancellor Palpatine\u2019s\n(Ian McDiarmid) influence in the\nRepublic.

Hopefully, Ian McDiarmid\u2019s\nacting skills will be up to scratch to\nconvince viewers that he is Emperor\nPalpatine, the tyrant who ruled with\nan iron fist.\nStar Wars II ended with a cliff-hanger, Senator Amidala\u2019s secret\nbetrothal to Anakin Skywalker.\nWe might have had to endure the\npainstakingly long relationship\ndevelopment in Episode II, but the\nsadists inside us will enjoy watching their marriage tear itself apart\nin Episode III.

This year, as\never, we hope that criticism will not be necessary. At this stage,\nthe signs are promising, and it would appear that large scale student\nsupport is all that is needed to make the event a big success.\nThe entertainment is booked, detailed plans have been released,\nand tickets are on sale soon. The only question mark hangs over how\nmany students will attend and how enthusiastic they will be.\nBy attending events such as this, and bringing your friends along,\nyou can play your part in changing the stereotype of bored, apathetic\nImperial students. Only by being positive can a real \u2018summer ball\nculture\u2019 be created within College. So, if you like the sound of what\u2019s\non offer this year, buy a ticket, go along and enjoy yourself. We\u2019ll see\nyou there.\nPolitics and brinkmanship\nDon\u2019t move into the\nhouse of horrors\nWhen finding a new house or flat, as\nwell as looking at the area you want to\nlive in and the people you want to live\nwith, it\u2019s important to bear practical\nissues in mind as well.\nIt is also important to make sure\nthat your landlord keeps to his or her\nresponsibilities under the law. Some\nof these are mentioned below. If you\nthink that your new landlord is bit\ndodgy or if you would like some advice\non the agreement you are about to\nsign, please feel free to contact the\nInformation and Advice Centre as we\noffer a comprehensive contract checking service and will be able to advise\nyou if your agreement is fair to you,\nthe tenant.\nDon\u2019t be nervous to ask your prospective landlord the questions you\nwant answered, no matter how awkward they are for him or her.\n\u2022 Is the deposit refundable? This is\nthe money you pay to cover damage\nto the flat or non-payment of rent.\nThis is usually around the same as\none month\u2019s rent. Make sure you get\na receipt for this. It will be returned\nto you when you leave. You may also\nhave to pay the first month\u2019s rent in\nadvance.\n\u2022 Check your tenancy agreement\nthoroughly. Make sure both you and\nthe landlord agree on the details.\nHow much will you pay and when?\nHow long is the contract? What is the\nnotice period? Does the contract set\nall this out?\n\u2022 Under a tenancy agreement the\nlandlord must make sure the property\nis in good repair, with adequate water,\ngas, electricity, sanitation and heat.\nIf the landlord says he will be fixing\nsomething before you move in, can he\nconfirm that in writing?\n\u2022 Check your obligations. What exactly does the landlord expect from you?\nWhat aspects of the upkeep of the flat\ndoes he expect from you? Preferably\nthis should all be in writing in the\ncontract.\n\u2022 Get the landlord\u2019s contact details\nin case something goes wrong. Take\nas many details as possible, including\nwho you should phone if he goes away\non holiday.\n\u2022 What are your rights? If something\ndoes go wrong, it\u2019s useful to know\nexactly what you\u2019re entitled to. To find\nout, why not contact The Information\nand Advice Centre.\n\u2022 Do the gas appliances have valid\n\u2018approved\u2019 certificates? Landlords\nmust have them checked annually\nby a registered CORGI (Council for\nRegistered Gas Installers) engineer.\nAsk to see the certificates. Faulty gas\nsupplies can be fatal if they result\nin carbon monoxide leaks. The law\nstates that your landlord must provide a safety check certificate within\n28 days of the gas check taking place\nand it must be produced before you\nmove in.\n\u2022 Will bills be in your name (collec-tively)? Will your landlord inform the\nrelevant offices? Were readings taken\nwhen the last people moved out? Were\nthey accurate?\n\u2022 Check if you are insured, either on\nyour parents\u2019 or your landlord\u2019s insur-ance.\nI hope you have found this article helpful and that you will find a\nproperty that is suitable for all your\nstudent needs. Just remember that if\nyou have any issues whatsoever while\nhouse hunting or if you just have a\nquick question with regard to housing rights, please do not hesitate to\ncontact The Information and Advice\nCentre on 020 7594 8067 or advice@ic.\nac.uk. You can also visit the centre in\nthe east wing of Beit Quad on a drop-in\nor appointment basis.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nMore than just doughnuts...\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, there is a\ngeneral election going on. There are\nno gimmicks available to entice you\nto vote today (yes, today is the day),\nother than, hopefully, the conscience\nthat comes with your sense of citizen-ship. (And before someone writes in\nto tell me that we are all subjects, not\ncitizens, I\u2019m a Republican!)\nBeing in a university environment\ncan be quite liberating. Many of us\nwill broaden our horizons and experience many new aspects of life during\nour time here. However, the depth of\nour immersion in this liberal culture\ncan be quite insulating. We can easily\nforget that there is a wider world out\nthere, one that we shall soon be moving into. A world in which issues that\nwe glaze over in news reports really\ndo matter.\nIt\u2019s true that many of us are disillusioned with politics \u2013 particularly\nthe mainstream political parties.\nHowever, that\u2019s not good reason for\nsitting on your posterior. Politicians\nalready ignore us because they know\nthat young people do not vote. You\nmay well believe that the main parties are just as bad as each other.\nYou may, like me, wish the UK would\nadopt the Single Transferable Vote\n(and the inclusion of a New Election\noption) in parliamentary elections.\nBut even if you just spoil your ballot paper or register a \u2018protest vote\u2019\nby voting for a no-hoper, you are\nsending a clear signal: you are not\napathetic.\nFirearms can hurt\nWhen I was first elected, Andy Heeps\n(President 1997-1998) warned me that\nthe day would come when the College\nwould \u201cput a gun to your head\u201d to get\ntheir way. I took Andy\u2019s advice guardedly and haven\u2019t really had to face that\nsort of situation \u2013 until the future of\nLinstead hall came into question.\nLinstead is the only catered hall\nin South Kensington, and conse-quently, despite some perceptions, the\nmost oversubscribed hall we have.\nThe College proposed moving the\nSouthside shop to the ground floor\ndining hall (ending catering for resi-dents, whilst providing no replacement kitchens). They also proposed\nopening up Linstead\u2019s first floor bar\ninto a public College bar, operated by\nthe Union. This would have the effect\nof leaving Linstead residents with no\nprivate communal space. The Union\nExecutive asked me to oppose the\nproposals.\nWhen I met College officials to\ndiscuss the situation, they were in\nno mood to compromise over the\nground floor. They did offer me a\nchoice with the first floor \u2013 I could\neither choose to have a College bar\nthere or else choose to have the area\nrefurbished for residents\u2019 use, but\nwith the existing hall bar closed. For\nreasons of \u201cfairness\u201d, the Weeks Hall\nbar would close with the Linstead\none.\nIn the interests of the hall residents\n(and given the underused bar capacity on the rest of the campus), I had\nto choose the hall bar closure option.\nBoth the Union Executive and the\nWarden endorsed my stance, in the\ncircumstances. I do not understand\nwhy College are taking this position.\nPerhaps they thought I\u2019d back down?\nAnyway, that\u2019s why the hall bars are\nclosing.\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nSouthside Bar will be missed\nA\nfter over 40 years, the Southside buildings will finally be demolished this summer. Undoubtedly, large scale refurbishment\nof the site is long overdue, especially given the current sorry\nstate of the halls of residence. But the reconstruction project brings\nwith it several knock-on effects that were not anticipated. It is difficult to escape the feeling that students will be worse off as a result\nof some of these changes, and that more could have been done to\nimprove the situation.\nSouthside Bar \u2013 popular, award-winning and with an unrivalled\natmosphere \u2013 will not be replaced. The College claims that having a\nbar in the new Southside is a \u2018low priority\u2019, but how many of the students and staff who regularly frequent the present bar would agree?\nIn the short term, the students\u2019 union claims to have been faced with\n\u201ca stark choice\u201d: either move the bar to Linstead Hall, resulting in\nthe loss of communal space, or close the bars in Linstead and Weeks.\nThe latter option was chosen, as the President and the Executive\nbelieve that there are enough public bar facilities on campus and\nthat it was more important to protect the private communal space\nin Linstead.\nWhy does the Union appear so keen to see Southside Bar become\nconsigned to history? Could it be because Southside is often more\npopular than the Union bars? More people should frequent the\nUnion building, but preventing choice is not the way to achieve this.\nImproving what the Union has to offer is the only way to go.\nSouthside Bar will be fondly remembered and sorely missed by\nmany. It is disappointing that the College and Union have not worked\nharder to find a place for it, both during the reconstruction and in the\nlonger term.\nLibrary disappointment\nM\nechanical engineering students will be saddened to discover\nthat their departmental library will close in the near future,\nespecially having received assurances that it would remain\nopen after we first broke the story in January.\nBizarrely, the department claims that the decision was taken in\nstudents\u2019 best interests. It is doubtful that the 400-plus students\nwho signed a petition against its closure would share that view. The\nlibrary will be converted into a reading room, as the current reading room is being taken over by the Business School. But surely the\nlibrary\u2019s books, collections and specialist service are of greater value\nthan an empty room designated for private study.\nStudents and their Union must continue to fight for highly valued\nresources such as this. The library may have been lost, but recent\nbattles for a place on the governing Council and sensible working hours have been won, at least in part. This demonstrates that\nalthough the College may seem to be placing financial or other\nconcerns ahead of educational ones, the voice of the students can\nstill be heard.\n\n"

Over \u00a334,000 of funding\nhas been secured from the\nCollege and corporate spon-sors. Tickets will be on sale\nfrom Monday and, according\nto the organisers, \u201cit looks set\nto be a great event\u201d.\nMusic at the ball will be provided by Radio 1 DJs Trevor\nNelson and Colin Murray,\namongst others. Indoor\nentertainment, including jazz\nmusic and a casino, will continue through the night until\nthe survivors\u2019 photographs\nare taken at 4.30am. Outside,\nthere will be fireworks and a\nfunfair on the Queen\u2019s Lawn,\nfinishing at midnight.\nDinner tickets are priced at\n\u00a345, including a three course\nmeal. \u2018Ents only\u2019 tickets, costing \u00a325 each, will grant access\nto everything but the dinner.\nOrganisers hope to have a\nliquor licence until 3am, and\nwill serve breakfast from\n2.30am, included in all ticket\nprices.\nSameena Misbahuddin, the\nDeputy President (Finance\nand Services), told Felix:\n\u201cWe\u2019re having the ball in\nCollege because whenever\nit\u2019s been on campus it has\nattracted a large number of\nstudents, and we wanted to\nmake it accessible to as many\nstudents as possible. It also\ngives us the opportunity to\nhave several different rooms,\na funfair and fireworks.\u201d\nLast year\u2019s ball, held at\nAlexandra Palace, attracted\nless than 1000 guests and\nmade a loss of over \u00a315,000.\nHowever, Ms Misbahuddin\nsaid that she expected around\n1500 people to attend this\nyear, and that less than 1000\nwould be needed to break\neven, due to the funding that\nhas already been secured.\nShe added: \u201cThe majority\nof other universities have a\nlarge, formal college-wide\nevent to celebrate the end\nof the year, and students at\nImperial deserve the same if\nnot better. It will be an excellent way to end the year.\u201d\nTickets will be available\nfrom Monday at Union recep-tion, the Union shop, Wye\nCollege Union, the Reynolds\nBar at Charing Cross\nHospital, and other locations\nto be announced.\n\u25cf Comment, page 4\nUnion launches Summer Ball 2005\nTrevor Nelson: the headline\nact at this year\u2019s ball\nBy Rupert Neate\nWhen the Southside area is\nrebuilt next year, the popular Southside Bar will not be\nreplaced. The building is due\nto be demolished in July, and\nCollege redevelopment plans\nmake no allowance for a bar,\neither during the reconstruction work or in the long term.\nThe new Southside, costing approximately \u00a350m, will\noccupy much less space than\nthe present one, being only\nsix storeys high compared to\nthe current nine. Space will\nbe lost throughout the build-ing, particularly in communal\nand retail areas. There will be\nonly one floor devoted to non-residential activity, and this\nwill be predominately occupied by an expanded health\ncentre and a caf\u00e9.\nThe College has stated that\ndue to the intense demands\non space, it is not possible\nto have a licensed bar in the\nnew Southside. This will be\nwelcomed by local residents,\nbut not by students.\nMustafa Arif, President\nof Imperial College Union,\nbelieves that in the long term\nthere may not be sufficient\ndemand for a bar in Southside.\n\u201cStudents are drinking less,\nand the national trend is that\nbar profits are in decline,\u201d\nhe said. However, demand at\nSouthside Bar would appear\nto be high \u2013 it is difficult to\nget a seat most nights of the\nweek, and hard to even find\nstanding space on Wednesday\nand Friday evenings.\nTony Mitcheson, the College\nSecretary, told Felix that,\nas a partial replacement for\nSouthside bar, \u201cCollege has\nproposed that the existing\nhall bar in Linstead should\nbe refurbished and opened\nto all Imperial College staff\nand students and their bona\nfide guests.\u201d However, this\nwill not go ahead after objections were received from the\nUnion.\nMr Arif said: \u201cThe Union\nobjected to plans to move\nSouthside Bar into Linstead\nHall in the short term. It\nStudents enjoy a lunchtime drink at Southside Bar, which will be demolished this summer and not replaced\n\u25cf Continued on page 2\n\u25cf Comment, page 4\n\u25cf State of the Union,\npage 4\n\n"

It\u2019s a requirement of the\nBusiness School, and we\u2019re providing a service.\u201d\nShe adds that a swipe card barrier would not solve the problem, as\npeople could still \u2018tailgate\u2019 in behind\nothers. So how else can access be\ncontrolled? Those who would rather\nsee more \u2018freedom\u2019 on campus will\nbe disappointed to hear some of her\nother ideas.\n\u201cI think in certain key buildings\nyou need access by turnstiles, and\nthat is coming, certainly for bio-chemistry. We have to make sure\nthat the highly sensitive areas are\nprotected by access control and\nsecurity cameras.\nPinn believes that having the\ncollege and department written\non a swipe card is itself a security\nrisk, just like leaving your address\nattached to your keys.\n\u201cI was surprised [to discover that\nthe information appears on the\ncards]. In the City you would never\nfind an access card with the name of\nthe firm on it. I did raise this and it\nwas discussed at a high level, but I\nthink people wanted something with\nImperial branded on it.\u201d\nShe has \u201cno objection\u201d to adding the Imperial College Union logo\nto swipe cards, but \u201cthe layout is\ndictated by corporate communications\u201d.\nBicycle parking\nBicycle parking at College has been\na contentious issue for many stu-dents, and Pinn admits: \u201cI\u2019ve got\nmore emails on my system about\nbikes, motorbikes and car parking\nthan just about any other topic.\u201d\n\u201cThere were efforts to concentrate bike parking in certain areas\nand make them as secure as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you concentrate\nthem [bicycles], you have a far better chance of being able to catch a\nthief... [but] it hasn\u2019t gone down too\nwell with certain people because\nunfortunately they\u2019ve had to walk\nfurther to their place of work.\u201d\nCynics will not be surprised to\nhear that one of the reasons for\nremoving bikes from Imperial\nCollege Road was \u201cto improve the\nlook of the campus\u201d.\nPinn is optimistic that \u201cthe new\nstudents will park their bikes where\nwe expect them to,\u201d because they\nhave never known any different.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old guard who don\u2019t like the\nchange. There are some staff and\nacademics who dislike the change\nenormously and are taking bikes\ninto buildings, which is a health and\nsafety no-no.\u201d\nShe is critical of students who\nwere opposed to the new cycle racks\nin Beit Quad. \u201cTransport for London\ngave them the money, they were\nnice racks, carefully chosen... but\nthere was enormous furore about\nthem. It was just that they didn\u2019t\nwant change. The shelters keep\nthe bikes dry and protect them, but\nwe only had bad comments about\nthem.\u201d\nHall thefts\nFollowing a spate of thefts from\nhalls of residence, I was keen to\nfind out how such incidents can be\nprevented.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to stop the incidents in halls, but we must reduce\nthem,\u201d says Pinn.\nBranch continues: \u201cThe simple\nthings are, don\u2019t carry large wads of\ncash. If you leave your room, even if\nit\u2019s just to go to the shower or visit\na friend, lock your door. If someone\nfollows you into hall and you\u2019re not\ncomfortable challenging them, get\nto a phone, call security and we\u2019ll\nalways come and check it out.\u201d\nHow did they get the message\nacross to freshers? \u201cWe went to\nall the halls in Freshers Week and\ngot a good response, depending on\nthe wardens,\u201d says Branch. \u201cIf the\nwardens were very pro-active, eve-rone was there and got the talk.\nOther places, there wasn\u2019t a good\nresponse.\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ll concentrate on\nEvelyn Gardens, because there has\nbeen a problem down there during Freshers Week, especially with\nthieves walking in after people.

Having beaten\nthe opposition already in the\nleague match a week earlier,\nImperial were confident of\nrepeating the feat.\nAs for warm up, the\ndynamic stretching of UCL\nwas matched by the usual jog\naround the pitch and smashing of balls into an empty\ngoal by Imperial. An inspired\ntactical change by Toadfish\nsaw the Harvester slot into\nthe usual backline of Sieve,\nGeorge Harrison, Foetus and\nBatty. Laruso was called back\nfrom his spearhead attacking\nposition to the holding midfield role, along with Stinky\nand Essex Wideboy, providing\nthe attacking ammunition for\nthe deadly strike force that is\nPiles, Toadfish and Flegm.\nImperial started with typical verve and began to spread\nthe play with pinpoint passing through the midfield\nand quick movement up\nfront. Then disaster struck\nas Stinky had to be substituted after being taken down.\nTallulah stepped in with calm\nassurance and took up the\ndefensive position almost\nimmediately.\nThen the UCL counterfeit\nversion of Essex Wideboy\nproceeded to throw himself\nover the shoulder of George\nHarrison to earn the reclusive Beatle five minutes in\nthe sin bin. Imperial survived\nthe power play with energetic\nrunning from Laruso and\nrock solid defending from\nFoetus.\nStraight after George got\nback on the pitch, Flegm, the\ntop scorer for the year with\nhis slip deflections, latched\non to a ball from Toadfish to\nscore in the bottom right hand\ncorner. Have it. It was then\nthat the umpires, two former\nstudents of UCL (whether\nthey ever graduated was not\nconfirmed), further disgraced\nthemselves by attempting to\nwipe the goal off for Imperial\nhaving \u201ctoo many players on\nthe pitch\u201d. The problem was\nquickly rectified by the tournament director. Open your\neyes, ump.\nImperial then went further\nahead from a familiar source.\nIn his last match for the cavaliers after four years of serv-ice, Essex Wideboy managed\nto score from the base line\nfrom another through ball by\nToadfish. Goal pie. The half\nended with Imperial 2-0 in\nfront.\nThe second half started\nwith the Anal Executioner\ntaking to the field to give\nFlegm a much needed\nbreather. Almost immedi-ately, Harvester proceeded\nto do what a Harvester does\nand ate his opposition alive\nwith a crunching tackle from\nbehind. That\u2019s five minutes\u2019\nrest in the sin bin for him\nthen.\nGeorge Harrison, not\nhappy about being matched\nin the yellow card stakes,\nthen decided to have another\nrun-in with the same UCL\nplayer and thus took another\nyellow and off he went again.\nSpecial.\nUnfortunately, after\nImperial were restored to a\nfull team, UCL came back\nwith two good goals of their\nown, especially one by their\ncaptain with a reverse stick\nstrike from top of the D.\nBoth teams became defensive in extra time and the\ninevitability of a penalty\nshoot-out loomed.\nHaving practised their penalty skills against ICSM in\nthe previous round, Imperial\nwere confident of the flick\ntakers.\nCometh the hour, cometh\nthe Man. Sieve, the Imperial\nkeeper, who has never lost a\nstroke competition in his life,\ngave a virtuoso performance\nin goal, saving two out of four\nflicks.\nFoetus, Toadfish and Piles\nall scored, but Essex Wideboy\nhit a weak effort straight at\nthe \u2018keeper. It all fell on Flegm\nin the end, and he didn\u2019t let\nall you UCL-hating people\ndown.\nSo to sum up, it was a legendary performance, ending\na legendary year in a legendary way.\nHOCKEY\nImperial\u2019s men\u2019s hockey team, who triumphed over UCL\non penalty strokes in the final of this year\u2019s ULU Cup\nQueen Mary Men\u2019s 5th 4\nImperial Men\u2019s 7th 2\nBy Will Swannell\nApparently there were a couple of cup finals involving\nImperial teams on one clear\nwarm Saturday last term, but\nin the eyes of the Sevenths\nthere was only one match\nthat counted \u2013 a six-pointer\naway to Queen Mary\u2019s.\nWe began the trek down to\nChiselhurst with our team\ndown to the bare bones. There\nwere no substitutes and\ndefenders Kofi and Will were\nboth nursing self-inflicted\nknee injuries, but confidence\nwas high as we had spanked\nQM 4-2 in our last meeting.\nThe game started out a\nscrappily with neither team\nfinding their feet, but after\na few minutes an innocuous\nchallenge from Will caused\nhis knee to flare up and he\nhad to go off. QM pressed\nthe one man advantage home\nand scored what can only be\ndescribed as a soft goal, with\n\u2019keeper Ario unsighted as a\npoor volley from the edge of\nthe area looped into the net.\nWill then came back on as\nImperial started to get back\ninto the game, with Ryan\nflashing a header past the\nfar post.\nBut QM somehow added a\nsecond as a ball was played\ninto the box and the QM\nstriker pounced to lash it ball\npast the advancing \u2018keeper.\nIt was only when we were 2-0 down that we started to play,\nwith Andrea, who had been\nsolid at the back all game,\npowering a header just wide\nat the far post. Sam was also\nunlucky when he was denied\na stone wall penalty as a QM\ndefender blocked his cross\nwith his hand.\nAt half time we were still 2-0\ndown, but with Ryan imperious in midfield and Tuan looking sharp up front, our tails\nwere up.\nWe were dominating the\ngame at the start of the second half and had QM pinned\nback. The goal came as Sam\nswung in a corner which Tuan\nnodded through the \u2018keeper\u2019s legs to end his recent\ndrought.\nThe second soon followed\nas Sam slid a through ball\nto Tuan, who finished with\naplomb. QM were now on the\nropes as we pushed forward\nto complete the comeback.\nRyan, who had been ghosting past the QM defence all\nafternoon, hit a peach of a\nvolley which stung the hands\nof the \u2018keeper.\nThen,withImperialstillrunning the show, things started\nto go a bit pear-shaped as\nWill and Andrea managed to\ninjure themselves.\nPushing for a winner,\nImperial were hit on the\nbreak as the QM striker held\noff John\u2019s challenge to stroke\nthe ball home and reclaim\nthe lead. Soon afterwards, it\nwas 4-2 when Will foolishly\ndecided to be a bit fancy and\nthe ball ended up with a QM\nattacker who rounded Ario\nand scored.\nWe were left sick as parrots wondering how we had\nlost and with Andrea debating how he was going to get\nto hospital.\nFOOTBALL\nSevenths lose out\nin six-goal thriller\n\n"

How\ncan you capture the public\u2019s\nimagination by naming the\nfirst ever planet observed\noutside of the solar system\nafter the number plate of\nthe lead researcher\u2019s\nMondeo?\nIn the past, they named\nplanets after gods: Jupiter\nwas \u2018the ruler of the heavens\u2019. They named Neptune\nafter \u2018the ruler of the oceans\u2019.\nMars is \u2018the god of war\u2019.\nConstellations take their\nnames from mythical beasts.\nGalaxies are named after\ncharacters in mythology\nsuch as Andromeda, Perseus,\nEosphorus and M-77 (NGC\n1068)... OK, maybe not the\nlast one. They even named\nPluto after Mickey Mouse\u2019s\ndog.\nA similar problem has been\nencountered in atomic phys-ics. Here, physicists\u2019 originality was put to the test when it\ncame to naming certain new\nradioactive elements. Their\nsolution? They started naming the new elements after\nplanets (92-Uranium, 93-Neptunium, 94-Plutonium),\ncelebrity scientists (99-Einsteinium), and America\n(95-Americium).\nPerhaps there are simply\nnot enough Greek symbols,\ngods and myths to name\nnew particles and plan-ets? Rubbish argument. We\nhumans don\u2019t have \u2018enough\nnames\u2019 to go round \u2013 which is\nwhy we have surnames and\nnicknames. So why don\u2019t you\ncall the new planet \u2018Jupiter\nFivetimes\u2019 (because the planet is supposed to be five times\nthe size of Jupiter)?\nPeople may argue that this\nis unimportant, that name-calling should not get in the\nway of the serious business of\nfinding new stuff.\nBut the scientific nomenclature headache is developing into a migraine. In biol-ogy, geneticists are facing a\nsimilar problem. Working in\nrelative isolation, different\nresearchers studying on different species have become\nattached to thier own respective gene-naming traditions.\nThose studying Drosophila\n(fruit fly), for instance,\nindulge in using gene names\nsuch as \u2018Sonic the Hedgehog\u2019\nand \u2018Lost in Space\u2019. Other\nresearch groups may call the\nsame genes by another name,\nand more often than not it\nis hard for different research\ncultures to agree on a shared\nname.\nIn the words of Michael\nAshburner of the EBI\n(European Bioinformatics\nInstitute), \u201cbiologists would\nrather share a toothbrush\nthan share a gene name...\ngene nomenclature is beyond\nredemption.\u201d\nThe first direct observation\nof the exoplanet is a major\nachievement, especially if you\nconsider that the first brown\ndwarf (body too small to be\na star, too big to be a planet)\nwas only observed in 1994.\nLet\u2019s do this new planet\njustice by giving it a proper\nname. One easy solution?\nCorporate sponsorship.\nAdvertisers would pay good\nmoney to sponsor historic\ncelestial objects. Who needs\n2M1207b, when you can have\nPlanet Orange? Or even\nPlanet Pringles...\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Elena Lengthorn\nScience communication\nChannel 4\u2019s Time Team,\nthat successful gang of history hounds fronted by Tony\nRobinson (better known\nto many as Baldrick from\nthe BBC comedy series\nBlackadder), have descended\nupon their first site of 2005 for\na manic three days of uncovering relics and architecture\nfor their thirteenth series.\nThe first episode was\nfilmed in March at a\nNorthamptonshire site called\nGlendon Hall where a local\nresident, Martin Hipwell, had\nuncovered a body when building a home for his mother.\nNot just one body, but body\nafter body. He then called in\nthe local archaeologists, who\nput him on to Time Team. I\njoined them there and met\nTony \u2018Cunning Plan\u2019 Robinson\nover a sumptuous lunch to\nhear all about his love of his-tory.\nTony never liked history\nmuch at school, or school\nin general, but as an adult,\nhe has an infectious enthusiasm about understanding\nthe past, to such an extent\nthat Teachers\u2019 TV managed\nto draft him in to teach a history lesson!\nOne of my interests, apart\nfrom meeting funnyman\nRobinson, was in the science that helps to make the\nprogramme possible, not the\ntechnology of the cameras\nand the sound, but the geo-physics.\nCue John Gator. He is the\nman responsible for this\narea of the programme and\npresents the geophysical\nfindings to camera. An expert\nwith 18 years experience in\ngeophysics, he has his own\nindependent consultancy\nand is associate editor of the\nJournal of Archaeological\nProspection.\nThe geophysics team consists of three highly trained\noperatives including John.\nThey use three different survey techniques \u2013 magnetom-etry, resistivity and ground\npenetrating radar \u2013 to try to\nlocate sites of significance for\nthe diggers without having to\nactually excavate.\nElectric measurements\nhave been used in area surveys since the 1940s. A resistivity survey works by sending small electrical currents\ninto the ground and measuring the variations in resistance as the current meets\nobstructions. High resistivity readings indicate possible foundations, floors, paths\nor roads, and low resistivity\nreadings are produced by pits\nand waterlogged ditches.\nFluxgate gradiometers are\nused to measure small anomalies in the earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield. They were specially\ndeveloped for use in archaeological prospecting and have\nbeen around since the 1970s.\nThey work by measuring the\nvertical gradient using two\nfluxgate sensors either 0.5m\nor 1.0m apart. They have an\nadjustable range and are\nextremely sensitive, detecting changes as small as 0.5\nnanotesla. It\u2019s a fast method\nthat can be used for scanning or for a more detailed\nsurvey. It\u2019s been used to find\nkilns, ditches, pits, furnaces,\nhearths and much more. I\ncan\u2019t tell you what it detected\nat Northamptonshire \u2013 I don\u2019t\nwant to spoil the surprise!\nThe final method they\nused for the Northamptonshire show was Ground\nPenetrating Radar \u2013 GPR\n\u2013 which is used for shallow\nprospection. It\u2019s a relatively\nnew technique that uses the\nabsorption and reflection\nof electromagnetic waves.\nWaves are transmitted into\nthe ground and reflected back\nwhen they hit different layers such as soil, concrete or\nrock. It provides stratigraphic\ninformation and defines dis-continuities. It enables the\ndepth of targets to be estimated based on the time it takes\nfor the waves to be reflected.\nIt can also be used, when data\nis collected along a series of\nclose parallel passes is com-bined, to create a 3D image\nof the area.\nGeophysics is a key tool\nin unlocking archaeological\nsecrets and has been used by\nTime Team right from the off.\nIt makes a huge difference\nto what can be discovered in\nthe pressured three days of\nexplorations.\nThe geophysics team\nworked tirelessly during the\nyear\u2019s first dig to undertake\ntheir surveys and then analyse the results in a bid to\ndiscover when and how these\nbodies came to be here. I\ncan\u2019t tell you any more I\u2019m\nafraid, apart from to say that\nthey\u2019ll need more cupboards\nfor the skeletons galore, and\nyou\u2019ll have to wait and see!\nWhen I met Baldrick and learnt about geophysics\nBrown dwarf and exoplanet: 200 light years away\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nFirst direct observation of exoplanet\nLast week astronomers confirmed the first direct observation of a planet outside the Solar System.\nDarius Nikbin looks at the new discovery and discusses the hazards of nomenclature\n\u201c...they started\nnaming the new\nelements after the\nplanets...\u201d\nIC Student Elena met Baldrick working on Time Team\nTony Robinson (centre): famous as Blackadder\u2019s servant, Baldrick\n\n"

Watch out for the 20th anniversary episode, to be screened in\nOctober, in which many famous\nex-neighbours are rumoured to be\nreturning, including Billy Kennedy,\nFlick Scully, Paul McClain, Lance\nWilkinson and Amy Greenwood.\nUnfortunately Kylie has declined,\nas has Jason Donovan because he\nhas \u201cother pressing commitments\u201d.\nYeah right mate, your career is really taking off, isn\u2019t it?!\nAlso, don\u2019t miss Dr Karl\u2019s band,\nwho are currently touring the UK!\nHe\u2019s playing Royal Holloway Union\non 3 June \u2013 I\u2019ve already got tick-ets. But why isn\u2019t he coming here?\nMore to the point, why does nobody\never play at our Union? Response\nrequired, Mr President.\n4th floor library dude\nHave any of you noticed that there\nis certain vest-wearing tall guy\nwho must spend his whole life on\nthe fourth floor of the library? As\nresearch for this column, I\u2019ve been\nspot-checking for his presence at\nrandom hours of the day and night.\nHe is always there.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not having a dig at conscientious hardworking people, but this guy is a\njoke. He never does any work, just\nsits at the computer and acts the\n\u2018big man\u2019 chatting to his mates. OK,\nthe fourth floor is the group study\narea, so people should be aloud to\nchat. But, so loudly and with his\npenetrating baritone? Please shut\nup.\nA couple of my mates reckon he\nstalks them around the library. They\neyeball him on the fourth floor, head\ndown to the second, but then low\nand behold he turns up downstairs\na few minutes later.\nI\u2019ve once seen him really agitat-ed, I think he was worried that\nas none of his mates were around\nhe might actually have to do some\nwork instead of pretending to. But\nhe was on the case: he got out his\nphone and texted his friends so that\nthey could have a little party in the\nlibrary!\nWhile on the subject of the library,\nshould it really be open 24 hours?\nPeople live in the library, which is\njust plain wrong, not just for their\nsanity, but also our nasal passages.\n\u201824 hour stinters\u2019 don\u2019t appear to\ngo home and wash, and I\u2019ve seen\nsome people brushing their teeth in\nthe toilets. I mean that\u2019s just plain\nwrong!\nThe Neighbours generation\nby RUPERT NEATE\nThere are moments when you want\nto die, there are moments when\nyou want to cry, there are moments\nwhen you scream for help\u2026 and\nthen there are Imperial College\nexams!\nBy now you are either revising\nfor an exam, taking an exam (and\nprobably failing it, as you should be\nreading the exam paper, not this!)\nor you\u2019ve just finished an exam (and\ninstead of partying like there is no\ntomorrow, you\u2019re reading Felix!\nWhat an exciting life, huh?)\nIn our academic lives, we all have\nto face exam time, whether we like it\nor not. (And if you like it, I wrote an\narticle about you last week.)\nSo today, I\u2019m going to concentrate\non these two questions:\n1. What kind of personalities can we\nspot in exams?\n2. How can you make it through an\nexam?\n1. What kind of personalities\ncan we spot in exams?\n\u2022 When you are in an exam class-room, you can smell it in the air...\nno, not the tension, but the sweat of\nthe students who haven\u2019t showered\nfor three days just to catch up with\nall the theory! These are the exami-nators: studying machines brought\nback from the future with only one\ngoal, to get at least 90% in all the\nsubjects! Virtually impossible, you\nmay think... but not for them! Even\nif they are attracting male giraffes\nthat confuse their odour with that\nof females in mating season, they\nwon\u2019t be distracted from their goal!\n\u2022 On the completely opposite side\nare the cheaters! For them, cheating is not a solution, it\u2019s a way of\nlife. They can\u2019t really be bothered\nto do any work, and so they spend\nthe whole time trying to figure out\ntotally new and efficient cheating\nstyles. I could write a whole article\nabout them, but I\u2019m going to let that\nopportunity go.\n\u2022 You can usually find a couple of\nsleepers. They slept through all the\nlectures, they slept through all the\nrevision period, they slept the last\ntime they tried to have a sexual\nrelationship and they sleep through\ntheir exams. Like a mutation from\nhuman to koala, they hibernate for\nthe whole year, only opening their\neyes to grab some bamboo or euca-lyptus.\n\u2022 The fourth type usually goes unno-ticed. Silent but deadly, like nin-jas, they release a gas bomb that\nwill disturb half of the class, get\nanother third killed by intoxication\nand leave only the examinators still\nhard at work. They are at the brink\nof extinction, but there is a discreet\nfarters\u2019 resistance trying to rise\nfrom the ashes.\n\u2022 Finally, we have the normal students (like you and me), who spend\nthe year partying and then go mental\nat exam time, trying to revise everything in one week. They usually end\nup doing well in the exams, but that\ndoesn\u2019t stop them from almost having a cardiac arrest on each exam\u2019s\neve and browning their pants when\nthey receive the exam paper.\n2. How can you make it\nthrough an exam?\nThis part of the article is written for\n\u2018normal students\u2019 only. So, if you\u2019re\nnot one, please just re-read Stormy\nWoods\u2019 column instead. (I would like\nto use this public space to say that I\nam really going to miss my columnist partner when she graduates! I\nreckon on your \u2018loving\u2019 odyssey you\nhaven\u2019t tasted a Latin social ana-lyser so, Stormy, whoever you are,\nif you want to improve your CV, just\nemail me \u2013 and I know from last\nweek that you\u2019re waiting to add a\nLatin lover to your collection!)\nAnyway, making it through an\nexam... I\u2019m not the best person to\ndo this (in fact, I\u2019m probably the one\nwho needs professional advice), but\nI\u2019ll try to do my best.\n\u2022 Try to sleep before your exam.\nDon\u2019t spend the night watching porn\nor thinking about how much you\u2019re\ngoing to have to study for the resits.\n\u2022 Stop getting drunk every other\nnight and start drinking stuff that\nwont interfere directly with your\nDNA.\n\u2022 Unless you are a \u2018silent but deadly\u2019\ntype, avoid beans and curries.\n\u2022 Try to revise every day, and not\nonly on the way to the exam (I\u2019ve\nseen loads of late revisers crashing\ninto trees in Hyde Park doing that).\n\u2022 Write notes while you\u2019re studying.\nIt helps you understand what you\u2019re\nreading and makes you look smart\nenough to the girls in your department (if you have any).\n\u2022 Never, but never, hang around\nwith walking encyclopaedias! They\u2019ll\nmake you feel like the dumbest guy\nin the world and you\u2019ll want to finish\nall the pain with a quick jump into\nthe Thames! Ignorance is bliss...\n\u2022 Finally... take it easy!

And think of\nall the girls/guys you are going to\nfind in that tropical country where\nyou\u2019ll be spending your holidays\n(if you\u2019re from a tropical country\nalready, think about all those fit tourists loaded with money!)\nAnalyse them\nby DIOGO GERALDES\nVOLUNTEERS NEEDED!\nWhy not get active in the community whilst you\u2019re at Imperial\nCollege London?

The intrepid Stormy has been\nout and about, sizing up the best\nstyles around to display her perfectly\ntanned, hairless pins. She hasn\u2019t had\nto worry about much else, since legs\nor no legs, Stormy hasn\u2019t been short\nof attention for the past week or so,\nthe majority of it being unwanted.\nTake the hapless geriatric Arab\n(hello, is it ever anyone else?) illegal\nimmigrant who tried to make a pass\nat me on the bus last week. Eight\nthirty am is just not the time to try it\non, especially if you have no chance\nin hell of getting anywhere.\nThe conversation went a little like\nthis, whilst I had my headphones in\nlistening to Hot Fuss, my favourite\nalbum of the last year, for the ten\nmillionth time. He disturbed me in\nthe middle of my favourite song, the\nwonderful Somebody Told Me.\n\u201cYou vote next week?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cYou vote immigration policy?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nCue puzzlement.\n\u201cI vote you be mine\u201d.\nCue disgust. I replace my headphones and turn to face the window.\nResistant and persistent, his per-viness continues, after tapping me\nrepeatedly on the shoulder.\n\u201cI like music.\u201d\n\u201cCool.\u201d\n\u201cI listen your music?\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t, the bacteria in your\nauditory canal will ruin my music.\u201d\nThankfully, the bus pulled into\na stop within running distance of\nCollege. Off I got, flustered and\nannoyed, and ran the fastest 1500\nmetres possible in three inch heels.\nThree inch heels?\nYes, I\u2019ve taken to joining the rest\nof the vertically challenged skinny\nsluts in College since it\u2019s project\nhandover week, meaning I\u2019ve got\npresentations galore. Imagine my\nglee on walking, all-prettied up, into\na room full of coffee, biscuits and\nflirty Brazilian waiters. Tasty stuff.\nAlas, that\u2019s as good as it got. My\npresentationwentdismally,consider-ing it turned out to be an impromptu\ndiscussion of my inappropriate couture footwear and a complete dismissal of my vital research into the\nmouse tissue factor gene. I mean,\nanimal rights aren\u2019t part of a BSc\nproject discussion, are they? Stupid\nveganmohairwomanwithhermousy\nhair and oversized Birkenstocks.\nShe\u2019s evidently jealous that she can\u2019t\nafford Jimmy Choos. Don\u2019t touch\nwhat you can\u2019t afford, sister!\nI walked off in a huff, ready to\nbreak down in tears, when the Ethan\nSpears-lookalike I\u2019d had a brief tryst\nin the Huxley with arrived with hugs\nand chocolate. He\u2019d heard I was in\nthe building and knew things hadn\u2019t\ngone well. He asked me out to coffee,\nand I obliged.\nIt\u2019s the least I could have done \u2013 if\nI\u2019d not got in there, somebody else\nwould have. And that, my dear read-ers, after his Thai soap massages, is\nnot something I\u2019d have like to have\nhappened!\nSo did Stormy get lucky or didn\u2019t\nshe? Let\u2019s just say the cat got the\ncream. I\u2019ll see you next week.\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nSo, a new term, and maybe even a\nnew Britain. Today, the great and\nthe good of the country will come\ntogether to make us all a new future.\nOr alternatively, what will actually\nhappen: the lazy people will have\nthe greatest say.\nNothing will change. Despite years\nof bitching and complaining about\nhow this country sucks, no-one will\nget off their arse for long enough to\nmake a difference. And because of\nthe electoral system of this country being as mad as a badger, the\nGovernment will once again be left\nwith a majority of 40,000 seats in\nthe House of Commons, and will\nbe able to plough ahead and knock\ndown the House of Lords to make\nway for a bowling alley. This will\nbe despite only have gained just\n11.3% of the vote, with most seats\ncoming from recent \u2018restructuring\u2019\nin constituency boundaries. Only in\nthe UK and its parent country, the\nUSA, can such blatant vote tampering happen.\nBut I\u2019m not one to whine about\nthings, so I\u2019m going to look on the\npositive side. It is only when politicians feel comfortable in their\nposts do they do something use-ful, so I reckon the next general\nelection should not be called until\n2012, in order to really muck up the\nOlympics.\nAll joking aside, use some of the\nenergy you\u2019ve saved up for porn to\ntick a small box and make a small\nchild happy.\nThe real world\nTime flies when you\u2019re having fun,\nand even more so when that fun\nis actually university. One minute\nyou\u2019re this fresh-faced youth with\ntime on his side and an intriguing\ntake on the world, the next you are\na grubby, bearded \u2018man\u2019 of indeterminate age with an intriguing take\non the concept of hygiene. What\nhappened to the intervening years?\nWere there really that many kebabs?\nReally that few women?\nSadly yes, but even more saddening is the concept of finals.\nFortunately it\u2019s only my housemate\nSeb who is doing these things, and\nbeing biology they shouldn\u2019t really\npose too much of a problem. Now,\nwhilst I like Seb, I truly fear for the\nfuture, for what is left of my life if\neven my housemates are having to\nbecome part of the real world?\nI can\u2019t believe how cruel life is. I\nwas just getting into Neighbours and\nHollyoaks, No Angels and Casualty,\nDoctors and Murder She Wrote; and\nthen those buggers come along and\nexpect me to remember some silly\nlecture from my first year, about\nenzymes. Or was it hormones?\nWhatever, I doubt I\u2019ll ever need it\nagain... especially as exam avoidance has allowed me to fulfil my\nlifelong (well since Eastenders last\nnight) ambition to become a qualified tap dancer.\nToilet seats\nSeriously, why is leaving the toilet\nseat up such a big issue? It\u2019s not like\npeople are small enough to actually fall into the bowl. How many\npeople have actually drowned in the\ntoilet? Whilst trying to piss? It\u2019s not\nexactly rocket science. Plus girls\naren\u2019t like blokes, and so generally\nturn the light on whilst using the\nbathroom. No such luxury for us,\nespecially if the floor is tiled. It\u2019s all\nabout efficiency, and possibly beating the house record time, whilst\nstill maintaining an air of dignity.\nWell, maybe without the dignity, and\npossibly with a lot more muffled\nswear words as you kick the bath for\nthe twentieth time that week.\nPersonally I think this is the\nclincher: women never put the seat\nback up when they\u2019re done, even if\na man has carefully left it up for his\nnext visit. It\u2019s only fair to leave it as\nyou found it, surely? Having cleaned\nup for us of course.\nScience\nScientists have recently worked out\nthe main driving factor behind all\nscientific discoveries. As, historically at least, most scientists have\nbeen men, it\u2019s surprising it hadn\u2019t\ncome to the fore earlier. The engine\nof learning is sex. From Newton\n(equations for dangling breasts, now\nused heavily by bra manufacturers\nandcosmeticsurgeonseverywhere),\nto Einstein (equations describing\nhow time slows down when a particularly attractive woman becomes\nnaked), sex has driven men to\ndevelop new and intriguing ways of\nenjoying it.\nThe most recent example is of\ncourse the internet, or the \u2018web of\nporn\u2019 as it was originally called. Its\namazing how quickly broadband has\nbeen picked up. Strictly for email of\ncourse, which gets there quicker\nif you have a dedicated 8Mbps line\nlinked into the Vivid Videos film site.\nHonest.\nBut on a serious note, space travel\nand exploration has taken a back\nseat since the Americans went to\nthe moon and confirmed it was like\nMonday lunch in the local pub \u2013 a\ncomplete lack of hot ladies. So my\nidea to rejuvenate NASA and their\nilk is to restart the programme\nthat brain-washes scientists into\nthinking that their is intelligent life\nelsewhere that just happens to be\nshaped like a centrefold. You might\nhave heard of it, it\u2019s called Star\nTrek. There\u2019s always hope when\naliens have to be told about this\nthing called love...\nElectioneering\nby TRISTAN LANE\nSo hello all you Imperial people! I\nam sure there are people out there\nwho already think they know something about me from that sentence.\nYou see, I was lying on my bed\nthe other night and it was seriously\ndark. I couldn\u2019t tell between opening\nand closing my eyes. Without any\nparents, any friends, any mirrors,\nany writing on the walls, any visible\nsociety or anything except my own\nmeandering mind, I wondered what\nthere really is of me. OK, so I had\nmy mind, and the wonderful concept\nthat I am thinking and therefore I\nmust exist. Though I don\u2019t really see\nhow that proves anything. I mean\nthis is it, really \u2013 the stripped down\nversion of ourselves that everything\naround us, including our faces, seem\nto decorate.\nSo I was meant to introduce\nmyself, but I couldn\u2019t think of a\nway of fundamentally identifying\nmyself without creating a reflection\nof something or someone else in the\nworld outside.\nI hate being asked where I am\n\u2018originally\u2019 from. I find the whole\nidea pretty hilarious. I mean, how\noriginal do they want to get? I stupidly tell them, \u201cfrom this world\u201d\n(no, not even a distinction between\nthe first and the third), only for them\nto stare at me pretty blankly until I\njust want to end their misery.\nWhat would a country say about\nme? Each country is just as diverse\nas the landscape of our being. It\nwould give clues about the empires\nthat flourished and demised with\ntime, the arbitrary political struggles that lead to men in traditional\nclothes drawing maps and lines to\nsignify the borders dividing the new\ngenerations, only to change over\nand over again throughout history.\nHow European will the Turks feel\nas soon the Brussels team are ready\nfor them to join? How Pakistani did\nthe Pakistanis feel two generations\nago? At least it leads to Imperial\nboasting about more and more clubs\nand societies, I guess.\nI am really glad that I have been\n\u2018accused\u2019 of \u2018trying\u2019 to be black,\nwhite and probably all the pretty colours in the rainbow, while ultimately\namusing myself in the knowledge\nthat I wasn\u2019t \u2018trying\u2019 anything and\nwas just being myself. And all along,\nhow much those people misinterpreted me, wasting their breath,\nthinking that I would be insulted by\nsaying I was pretty damn universal!\nOh yes, the age old psychological\ninsight that tells us that we should\nfeel insecure if we cannot provide\na label for ourselves. How about\nstriving to find security within ourselves without the labels and the\nwhole fa\u00e7ade? Fortunately, no single\ncountry, no single religion, no single\nway of life can sum it up for me. A\nblank canvas leaves me far more to\nplay with!\nWho am I?\nby SUMA BHATTACHARYA\n\n"
