In the\npast the society was renowned for its very\nactive social events, such as the 'regular'\nevening meals. For such occasions, a bunch\nof both Italian and non-Italian cas in is ti( sorry, un transl a table...) would gather at an\nItalian restaurant, where you could get a decent meal (by Italian standards!).\nUnfortunately, the society folded due to lack\nof members willing to take up the posts in the\ncommittee, probably because not enough\nbribes were raised.\nBut the newly formed Italian Society,\n'officially accepted' by the OSC last term, is a strict adherent of anti-corruption policies,\nnow working effectively in Italy.\nEnough jokes for the moment... The traditional evening meals will not be the main\nevents organised by the society. We intend to\nbe very active for this year, involving both\nItalians and non-Italians and trying to have\nfun all'Italiana.\nThe events we intend to do vary from the\nphysically demanding Quasar games to relaxing Italian film sessions. Others include sport\nevents, such as football (NB: World Cup final-is ts...), volleyball, table football, etc.\nMost importantly, events we are looking\nforward to are : International night, where we\nhope to present Italian food and a tradition-a lal Italian dance, and Latin Night, which\nwill be a joint venture with the French and\nSpanish Societies.\nMembership fees are \u00a33. We know it's a rip off but you'll surely get more than you\npaid for in term of social life so come and join\nf FELIX I3J M195 us. See us in the JCR at lunch-time (just look\nfor a bunch of Italians, they usually stand\nout) if you want to join us. For more information (such as dates of events), you can contact\nthe following people; K.

The scoring is bold\nand imaginative, although Berlioz did not yet\nknow Beethoven, and showed hints of\nBerlioz's late romantic love of immensity.\nDespite the lack of adequate practice\nfacilities Imperial College Symphony\nOrchestra has grown extremely large, so that\nin terms of instrumentation we were in a good position for this performance. Indeed,\nthe overture was chosen amongst other things\nfor the fact that it could exploit our size, most\nnotably the four tuba players.\nThe overture finished, I enlisted volunteers and made use of my major musical skill,\nnamely pushing the piano onto the stage for\nGershwin's piano concerto in F, the second\nitem in the programme. This is only\nGershwin's second well known work and was\nhis first serious work for orchestra after being\nrecognised for Rhapsody In Blue. Gershwin\nwrote popular tunes but with his serious\nworks, however, this resulted in a somewhat\nrepetitive development. Hence it is up to the\nmusicians to prevent the audience tiring of its\nconventionally defective construction.\nThis was facilitated to a certain extent by\nthe use of various jazz-inspired devices such\nas the walking bass line of the pizzicato celli\nand double basses. Also worthy of particular\nmention was the trumpet playing of Steve\nHicks, an Ash music scholar. Although a suitable tr il by for muting the trumpet was\nnot available until the last rehearsal, the stylish solo was played with much daring. This\nwas vindicated by a musical performance\nwhere the technical difficulty of the solo, particularly the intervals, went unnoticed by all\nthe non-trumpet players in the audience.\nMost important to the concerto is the\npianist. One of the benefits of having a professional musician conduct the orchestra is\nthat, as a bonus, we regularly get soloists of\nthe highest quality. Our soloist on this occ a sion, Vanessa Latarche, was no exception.\nAfter the normally bibulous interval, the\norchestra returned for Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dances. The tentative feeling\nfrom the beginning of the concert had gone,\nand the relaxation of the orchestra with what\nwas by now a very familiar piece clearly\nshowed, as the audience ignored the orchestra\nin favour of listening to the music. Standing\nat the back of the auditorium listening to the\nsound of the strings it was clear why so many\nviolinists had asked to play this. The orchestra was obviously enjoying themselves, particularly during the first two movements. The\nstring sound was exemplified by Ed Bale,\nleader of the orchestra, a joint degree student\nand also the soloist at one point, giving us the\nbenefit of a resinous gypsy sound.\nAs a critical review, this has been something of a failure, but anybody who can take\npart and not write a similar review must be\nlacking in some respect. As scientists, perhaps you should judge for yourselves. Our\nnext concert has a British theme and will\ninclude not only the Elgar violin concerto\nand Britten's Sinfonia Da Requiem, but also\nthe premiere of a piece by Andrew Booker,\nwho graduated from IC last year and used to\nrun the jazz and rock club.\nD( g Qg Wolf Keys: Coppola, Jack, Pfeiffer Wolf is a rather peculiar little film updating\nthe werewolf myth for the '90s. It scores heavily over Francis Coppola's rehash of 'Dracula'\nin that it is far more concerned with character\nand emotions than surface sheen. A book editor played by none other than Jack Nicholson\n(who, let's face it, is initially hard pushed to\nplay a wimpy executive type) is bitten by\nsomething he is sure was a wolf, and begins to\nin some way merge with the spirit of the wolf.\nThe emphasis is upon his new lust for life,\nhis heightened perceptions and his growing\nrelationship with his nasty old boss's daughter played by Michelle Pfeiffer.\nThe story verges on the surreal at times\nand does have a couple of good, if predictable,\ntwists near the climax. More of a 'Mid-Life\n\n"

    "content": "News\nUnion Move Considered\nBY MICHAEL LUD LAM The Union could move to\nSherfield within three years if a college feasibility study is\nsuccessful. The speed at which\nthe plans are moving forward has\nsurprised Union staff who when\nfirst approached were told that a move could not be achieved in less than five years.\nDan Look, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services)\nadmitted: \"We've found out it is\nnot as long term as first\nanticipated.\" The reduced time\nframe was explained by Ian\nCaldwell, Director of Estates,\nwho said that it was intended\nthat the work on Sherfield would\nbe completed at the same time as\nthe new medical building in1998. However, both college and\nunion officials stress heavily that\nthe plans produced so far are for\na feasibility study which will be\ncompleted at the end of this\nmonth. \"The feasibility study is\nthere to demonstrate whether\ncreating a sort of academic-social\nspace is feasible and what it\nmight cost,\" said Mr Caldwell.\nHe added: \" If we are going to\nattract students in the future\nwe've got to create the right\nfacilities for them.\"\nOn being shown tentative\nplans for a move to Sherfield,\nUnion staff have found many\nproblems with the design. In\nparticular, initial sketches\nsuggest that the need for a union\nbar has almost been neglected,\nonly showing it as a small space\non the third floor. \"We're not too\nkeen on having a bar on the\nthird floor,\" said Dan Look. He\nadded that if a space on the\nground floor was found then this\nwould \"attract\" the union to a move.\nAlready, assurances given at\nthe beginning of last term seem\nto have been changed. Moving\nthe Union Dining Hall and the\nUnion Bar, \"panel by panel\" to a new union building is proving\nunfeasible. \"I don't see how it\nwould work,\" said the Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services),\nhe added that they would remain\nin their present positions. There\nhave also been concerns as to\nwhether Union catering would\nbe able to compete with college\ncatering.\nThe plans presently include\na bookshop which the Union would run and other retail\noutlets: the provisional plans\nshow a Tower Records store. The\ncentral light wells in the\nSherfield building would go.\nThey would be replaced by a large hall with tiered seating and\npartition walls to provide more\nrooms. If, as has been suggested,\nthe Union were also given\ncontrol of the Great Hall, then\nthis would give the Union two\nlarge seated venues. But this\nwould not necessarily be\nbeneficial for the Union since it\ntends to request lots of small\nrooms at once. Dan Look admitted that it was, \"hard to see\nhow we would get everything to\nwork\". Other ideas for the\ncentral light well space would be\nto turn it into a nightclub venue,\nsimilar to Tutu's at King's College, with a bar above looking\ndown.\nFELIX understands that not\nall of the administration staff are\nkeen on a Union move to\nSherfield. They will have to be\nwon over by the proposer s of the\nscheme if it is to go ahead. It\nmay be that in the new Sherfield\nbuilding the college administration will be smaller both in\nsize and staff numbers.\nThe Union are still pushing\nfor a feasibility study to look at\nhow Beit Quad could be\nimproved as a student area away\nfrom the rest of college. In a promise to students Mr Look\nsaid that students would be\nconsulted and that a referendum\nwas, \"not something we would\nrule out\".\n(New Constitution continues\nfrom page one...)\nBody at the end of last term. But\nparts of it have caused\ncomplications, the ' Mary's Amendment' has itself been\namended after the Governing\nBody found some of the wording\nunsuitable for inclusion in the\nlong term constitution.\nAt the Union General\nMeeting last November, Claire\nMoloney, St Mary's Hospital Medical School Student Union\nPresident, passed an amendment\nwhich made Mary's Union financially responsible to\nmedical school officials. It also\nseparated Mary's funding from\nICU's until the medical school\nmoved from Paddington to\nSouth Kensington. All other\nConstitutent College Unions are\nfinancially responsible to the\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices).\nHowever, it was decided that\nmeasures which would probably\nrequire the constitution be\namended at a later stage should\nnot be written into the\ndocument. Also removed was the\nMary's Union financial\nexception which took\nSM HMS SU out of the\nresponsibility of the Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services).\nThe amendment was\nintroduced after students were\nconcerned that the finances of\nMary's Union would be decided\nby mostly non-Mary's students.\nAccording to the Governing Body, these concerns have been\naddressed in the revised clause.\nUnder this revised clause Mary's Union will have a separate\nearmarked sub vent ion 'for such\nperiod as the Governing Body\nshall determine'. It is to be\nadministered and accounted for\nunder 'arrangements approved\nby the Rector'.\nThough, under this new\nclause, Mary's Union could be\nforced to be immediately\nfinancially accountable to ICU, it\nis understood that College\nofficials will delay any such\nmeasures until after medics\nmove onto the South Kensington\ncampus.\nProfessor Peter Richards,\nDean of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, commented: \"I think in the circumstances it is a Continues overleaf...\nMM FELIX I3 JAI195 "

Of course, professional\nthieves can nearly always use technology\nsidestep these limitations, e.g. Videotapes are\nencoded using 'MacroVision' to deter would\nbe pirates but the clever ones use a piece of kit\ncalled a sync convertor to get around this.\nLee was also unsure that retrieval times\nwould be getting much faster in the next few\nyears, especially internationally. Anyone\nwanting fast data transfer needs a more\nexpensive link such as the Superjanet\nbackbone that IC sits on. Ultimately, heavy\ninvestment is needed to get real speed. Lee:\n\"To do cute tricks you need to lay cables\".\nSo we have a potentially revolutionary\ntechnology, only that no sooner does it appear\non the horizon then it seems to be riding a donkey. Perhaps the reticence the music\nindustry has shown is justifiable. Between the\nlack of copy protection and the slow access\ntimes, it may be a little premature to throw\naway your Tower Record vouchers. Could it\nreally be the end of the high street retail trade?\n\"It's certainly possible,\" says Emma Ffanning of the BPI, the meeting point of the\nrecord company world. \" Obviously the\nindustry hasn't looked at it enough to decide\nwhat the effects are going to be but it could\ndramatically change things.\"\nEmma, who thought that \"this year\ncompanies are really seriously beginning to\nlook at at it [the Internet] and get their act\ntogether\" also advised me to phone a company\ncalled Cerberes who, in her opinion, were the\nfurthest advanced in the provision of on-line\nmusic. I spoke to Ricky Adar, a man who\nbelieves his company has cracked the\nencryption problem. It relies on the fact that\nthey have pulled off quite a coup:\n\"We've got an agreement with National\nWestminster Bank to collect credit card\ndetails through the Internet now,\" says Ricky,\n\" And to the best of our knowledge we are\nprobably the first company in the world to get\nan agreement from a national bank.\"\nBasically the system works as follows.\nThe user sends his credit card details to the\nCerebes server in Denmark street, which then\nreturns a personal player encrypted with the\nusers credit card details, name and address\n'burnt' into it. Every\nsubsequent sound file that's downloaded is\nencrypted to ones\nown player. Thus\nmusic can only be\nexchanged by also\ngiving away your\nplayer, which amounts to giving away your\ncredit card details! (This kind of 'Personal\nProtection' scheme cunningly protects the\ncompanies interest by putting your person on\nthe line!)\nBut what about Lee's point suggesting\none could always tap into the sound on the\nway to the speakers? He misses step for a moment then:\"You could probably do that,\nyeah. We're of the opinion that as we make it\ndifficult for people to clone... [to distribute the\nresultant copy] you'd need your own\ncompressor to do that. Our audio compressor\nthat is coming out is 15:1.\"\nRicky claims they have had considerable\nindustry interest, and have signed the largest\n\" These are artists and if they don't eat they stop making music!\" independent label in the US. At the sharp end\nthen, does he see this as the end of the retail\ntrade? \"Long term, yes. We've just spent five\nbillion pounds cabling up every street in London. What's going to happen to it? It's going to have on-line services on it of course.\"\nCerebes are reluctant to reveal a web\naddress because, says Ricky, \"As soon as we\nput up details that we are offering a Credit\nCard clearing service - we know that the\nwhole of the net is waiting for it so we know\nwe are going to get deluged.\"\nMore than supplying music, they see\nthemselves setting up a structure that will be able to\ncope with realtime sound\ntransmission, possibly only\ntwelve months away. Users\nwith free cable calls will thus use it as a jukebox.\nBut Ricky strongly\ndisagrees with the Net\nethics of no-cost free produce. \"If people want\nto charge for their produce they should be able\nto charge for it. These are artists and if they\ndon't eat, you know what I mean, they stop\nmaking music!\" He disagreed with what he\nrefers to as 'the L.A crowd' saying that the\nCerebes system brings money back to bands\nfaster than ever before.

Whether he will actually\nmake any strategic difference to\nthe issue of undergraduate finance\nmay, however, be doubtful.\nThe SLC has made a complete mess of this academic\nyear. Its last chief executive\nresigned due to ill health at the\nend of last year, when reportedly\nthousands of students had had\ntheir applications lost in the\nsystem. In some ways the SLC's situation is not very different from\nthe CSA's. Both were formed to\nshift the source of finance of what\nused to be publicly-funded goods.\nBoth have been unable to cope for\nreasons that arise from the\ngovernment's inability to tackle a policy issue head on.\nThere is a need for reform\nbecause the picture of\nundergraduate finance is very\ndifferent from reality. It appears as\nthough the govern met funds\nundergraduate education. It\ndoesn't. Grants are not universal;\nthey arrive late; and they rarely\nforgot. Yea, those texts, those\ncrusted and crumbling words which\nfall to one's eyes, cannot be\nappreciated from without the bleak\ngaze of a computer screen but\nmust be gleaned from that most\nancient and yet modern device, the\nbook. I dream of my wish that\nbooks may remain as they are for\never more, for there is something\nso beautiful and touching about\nthis archaic manner of passing\ninformation from one to another.\nBooks also lend themselves\nso easily to places of beauty; the\ncorner of the park or the rattling\nseat of the underground in which\none reads them, and of course the\ncomforting surrounds of the shop in\nwhich they are procured. There is\nno more inspiring such place than\ncover the rent. But it is a pragmatic\nidea not to raid the public purse for\nmoney. Consider it this way: is it\nthe government's job to sub sid is e expensive training for a minority?\nTraining that will be of benefit first\nto the recipient? More importantly,\ndo students want to be treated as\nthose relying solely on the State?\nScience students can, in particular,\nstand on their own two feet better\nthan others. (The last is a hunch I have, but am not aware of any\nnumbers to back it up with.)\n\"Is it the government's job to sub sid is e training\nfor a minority? \"\nThe main political parties\nseem to be of the view that grants\nare not the way to go: The Tories\nwith their attempts to shift the\nburden of financing to the student\nhimself; And Labour now taking\nthe view that further education\nshould be funded via some kind of\nGraduate Tax, to be administered\nperhaps through the National\nInsurance system. But it remains to\nbe seen whether either will actually\nplunge head first into such\nreforms. Both will be scared of\nlosing votes from the middle-class\n(\"it's our right to be educated\")\nand the lower-class (\"loans will\ndeter the poor student\"). Political\nparties never have the guts for this\nkind of fight.\nSo, Mr Ash's job, it seems,\nwill largely consist of day to day\noperational matters at the SLC.\nMore the pity.\nSamin\nAtlantis Books, hidden down an\nalley near the halls of the British\nMuseum. This veritable treasure\nhouse of arcana and obscure\nhistory has built up a patina of\nmysticism that truly reflects the\nnature of the texts within.

Skulking in a corner\nyou may find your Frater, unusually\ntimid in such an holy place.\nA book can also bestow its\nbeauty onto the region in which it\nis perused. Upon opening his tome,\nthe reader becomes transformed\nfrom a lonely soul to a sculpture\nwhich remains in eternal reference\nto its surrounds, the absorption of\nhis mind creating a timely\njuxtaposition with the endless flux\nof activity around him. It is a moment without the universe.

    "content": "The S Files\n\u00b0God machines\nSusie\na spanner in my works TECHNOLOGY GETTING FREE\nTHE AUTHORITARIAN COMPUTER\nA CINEMATIC ICON\nOne of the most misguided of the modern techno ph re ak's wisdom bytes is that the\ncomputer is making us more free. Listen to the plaintive b lee tings of the Internet\ncrowds [especially the San Diego one]. On they go with their anarchistic meandering s about how the Net is so big that no one can control it and how authoritarian\ngovernments can do nothing about it. Hurray!! Then off they go to input the top floor\nof Delft University. Still that aside it should be obvious that the power of Internet is\nonly the mirror of the power that the computer brings to the establishment. Just as the\ncomputer [in conjunction with the Criminal Justice Act and genetic fingerprinting]\nwill allow the British Police to build up a national dna database of all criminals [kinda\nscary huh?] so imagine how quickly government agencies can access information on\nyou - from your last library book taken out to tax, medical, insurance and wage\ninformation. Someone once said, 'computers aren't good or bad, computers are\npowerful' but that implied neutrality misses the mark. Because computers are powerful\nthey will be used by the powerful to enhance that power. Indeed the examples of\nChina and Singapore show that technology and democracy are by no means\nsynonymous.\nIn the same way, \u00a9 Joseph Weizenbaum poured suspicion on the whole\n'computer revolution' syndrome. He pointed out that all the introduction of\ncomputers into organisations accomplished was the shoring up of bureaucratic\nworking practises which would have had to have been changed because they were\nbeing over loaded by information. Hence the 'computer revolution' is a total\nmisnomer, it should really be called 'the period of computer conservatism'.\nThe most powerful theme within the\nFrankenstein story is the one concerning the\nautonomy of the created creature. In the\nactual novel this is taken to a climax with the\nmurder of Victor Frankenstein's wife on her\nwedding night and the eventual death of\nVictor himself.\nWhen this kind of thinking is\ntransferred to modern issues of technology\nthe same fear is also developed. However, it\nis important to realise that all technology has\nthat same freedom to become autonomous\nonce developed. We do not have to built\nartificially intelligent machines to see this in\noperation. In fact it is this very quality\nwhich makes technology useful. An artifact\nor technique maybe designed for a specific\npurpose but it generally it only becomes\nuseful when it is applied to a totally different\nfield from that for which it was first\ndesigned.\nIn a strange sense this is one way\nscientists remove themselves from the\nresponsibility for their work. It has become ac liche to hear phrases along the lines of \"I just do pure science, its application is\nsomeone else's problem\". So in order to\novercome the Frankenstein dilemma\nscientists must be responsible and face up to\nthe fact their work will be applied in ways\nwhich are not obvious and with which\nthey may disagree with.\nIf w \u00ab Fell in there you'd be mashed\niti a trice Nitro ret mr ma m0ri \u00abr ter*. \u2022\u2022 look, down there,\nWU NV tea...\ncredits: inspiration - her ge& tintin\neverything else - jon\nw. Frankenstein may not at first appear to be a good\nplace to start a study of how our culture ,\nthrough film, views technology. The standard\napproach of Boris Karloff in the 1931 classic was\ncertainly evocative but also highly wayward in\nterms of literal accuracy. It also perverted the\nimage of Frankenstein's monster from\nsomething which was produced through the\nsecret but noble arts of alchemy and natural\nphilosophy into something crude and base.\nHowever during the 1970's Frankenstein's monster became a popular metaphor for\n\"mankind's ambiguous relationship to\ntechnological creation and power\" - 9 Langdon\nWinner. Since then, the image has been put to\ngood use in the cinema, particularly in the\nmodern genre of science fiction.\nAlien is an interesting film because\nthe real villain is not the alien life form\nbut the man-made android science\nofficer, Ash. Ash was created by the\ncompany and in obeying them it destroys all its\ncrew members excluding Ripley. Equally the\nRamboesque style of Aliens inverted the\noriginal's ethos as this time it was the aliens who\nwere the real enemy [Burke aside]. Only military\ntechnology, including Bishop - another android\nscience officer, saved the day.\nHowever perhaps the most striking film in this line of thinking is Blade Runner. One\nobvious point here is the revenge wreaked upon\nthe creators by the created as both T.S. Sebastian\nand Tyrell are murdered by the Nexus 6\nreplicants. Yet a more interesting angle is that in\na human world where technology only seems to\nlead to decay and rot, it is the man-made\nreplicants which appear to most human. Indeed\nthe mercy shown by the replicant's leader, Roy\nBatt, to Deckard, his supposed terminator, is the\nmost emotionally alive part of the film. In this\nway the metaphor of Frankenstein's monster has\nperhaps become even more damning than in its\noriginal form.\nFELIX "

The\nplace rammed last weekend with\nthe least pretentious crowd around\n& the beats were pumping.

The feel here was elegantly\nsummarised as \"rather more\nchoice FM than kiss FM\" -thanks\nJeff!- ie, funk with a slightly\nsoulful style. Only the quality\nreaches these decks lined up with\nstyle by Keevan B, Ronnie Herrel &\nWilber Wilberforce and friends.\nDefinitely worth a visit.\nThe Goodfoot - Saturdays;\n70-5.30 at the Wag, 35 Wardour\nSt, \u00a310/\u00a36NUS KAT club, Bar Rumba, the\nTrocadero, 36 Shaftesbury Av,\nFridays 10-4, \u00a33 b477, \u00a36 after. Q Irony is a word not unfamiliar to the\nsenseless things. Take that name\nfor instance. Just an impetuous and\nyes, ironic choice that has\ninexplicably led to them being\ndismissed as a gig-a lot, teenage,\nT shirt band. And then there's the\npopular music press falling all over\nitself to laud punk as a musical\nsaviour resurrected when in reality it\nnever died, when the likes of the\nsenseless things were using it in\ncreating their unique sound years\nago, when they were writing about\nissues long before it became 'right-on' to do so, when of course it was\nun trendy to do so.\nBut this is not a band to sit\nback in protest and live at the\nCamberley Agincourt they are\nheaven bound on giving the\nsizeable, if somewhat reticent, crowd\na Christmas party to remember\n(hangover included). 'Touch me on\nthe heath' is the perfect opener -five minutes of soaring guitars and\nrasping vocals which moves from\nmid-paced canter to a blazing,\nFELIX Fiona officially enters 1995 -\"the one I which I left ic\"- and\ncelebrates at Goodfoot and the Kat club.\nA new year? 'A whole new can of live worms' reply the music\nteam. Vi'k returns to his first love, watching the senseless\nthings and tintin rues those cipher boogie masters, zz top.\nArran Frood goes down the pub and enters the play world of\nraising fire. It's warm and inviting he says ...\n1,2 ... Freddy's coming for you - tintin ducks Wes Craven's New Nightmare before hitching a lift with even cowgirl's get the blues. Joe then regains his memory watching Hal\nHartley's amateur.\nthe senseless things\nextra stubbly perceptions\nroaring finish. And pretty much\neverything from then on is perfect\ntoo. There's the soothing of 'role\nmodels', the thrashing of 'just one\nreason', the breakneck, amphetamine pop of 'pony boy'( which\nsinger Mark Keds wryly introduces\nas being \"for any punks amongst\nyou\") and the schizoid trip through\ncalm and madness that is 'keep-sake'. And their set would not be\ncomplete without the now\ntraditional closer, 'homophobic\nasshole' - a violent invective where\neverything that makes this band so\ngreat fuses together into an all-out,\nhardcore feast.\nYes, the senseless things are an\nexperience to behold both on stage\nand on record. And if you need any\nfurther convincing of their worth\nthen ponder on the fact that they\nencored with their new single which\nthey've called 'something to miss'.\nNow that really is ironic ...\n... a fact that would have been\nlost on zz top at Wembley Arena. In\na way it's surprising as they're the\nband who have seemingly made a career purely out of having two\nmembers with beards longer than\nan Edward Lear's creation whilst\nsimultaneously having a drummer\ncalled Frank Beard who is singularly\nun endowed. And much of the zz top image\nis on the same level of just being. I mean this is band who arrive in\nnear spinal tap style onto a stage\nshaped like a car's dashboard and\njust are zz top. They don't have to\nplay anything to get there, they just\nhave to be - conceptual figures\nfitted out in shades, stetson s and\nlong ( and for all we know stick on )\nbeards.\n\u00ae kindling\nRaising fires is staged at the back\nof a pub, the Bush, and it's a nice\none at that. In such a relaxed,\nunpretentious atmosphere I'm constantly reminded that I'm sitting watching a play, some\nfictional events from 1603.\nThe six main characters have\na roughly equal standing so they\nreceive equal thought and\nattention. The tale begins as an\narsonist's whodunnit. Blaze after\nblaze destroys the town and the\ntownsfolk's tolerance. If the main\ncharacters combined their efforts\nthe arsonist could quickly be\nfound, but they work for their own\ninterests, clouded by jealously,\nbigotry and prejudice.\nThe play exerts crisp control\nover the senses: the lighting for\nthe first scene is of perfect\ndelicacy; the blood red fire is\ndelivered with sweet subtlety. The\nactors demonstrated tension and\nfear movingly. Paul Ritter's performance as a disturbed village\ncriminal was the most potent, his\nsincere line \"I was born a murderer\" got the biggest laugh.\nPerhaps humour wasn't employed\nat many opportunities where it\ncould have been. If it had the play\nwould have been more of a black\ncomedy but I feel that comic\npotential wasn't wasted, it just put\nto one side.\nI can't complain really,\nmes meri sed by the second act I didn't even finish my interval\npint... \u00a9\nStill some sort of performance\nis offered up. These guys haven't got this big without pleasing the\ncrowd and it doesn't take too long\nbefore the last top trump, after\nbeards and cars, is unveiled.\nWrithing, sinuous female silhouettes\nare projected up to general lad dish approval. Billy and Dusty continue\nwandering around with their\nchurning boogie riffs but the tone of\nthe evening has been set. At three\nsongs intervals on prance the six\nlovelies in various stages of\nmis dress. The crowd love it and to\nbe honest there's not much else to\nget excited about.\nThe gulf between older songs\nlike 'jesus just left Chicago' or 'I'm bad, I'm nationwide' and the\ncurrent cover-single, 'viva las vegas'\nis not just one of authorship but\nrather underlines a deeper issue, zz\ntop are dangerously close to\nbecoming a kind of postmodern\nphenomenon - rock icons without\nmeaning or tunes, just a old set of\ngreying whiskers. 0\n\n"

Lucy calls time up to the rowdy boozers...\nNetwork\nDear Owain\nA student visited the Union asking\nabout the Lesbian/Gay Network.\nThe Lesbian gay network was\nstarted last year by two lecturers to\nprovide a support network for\nstudents. Unfortunately the lecturers left so the network stopped.\nA student has now approached\nme to say that he is prepared to\nrun this network. So if you are a Lesbian or Gay student and would\nlike to get in touch with other\nG. L.B. students there is a pigeon\nhole in the Union Office or you can\ncontact me and I will pass your\nname on. Similarly if you want to\nhelp with the network use these\nmethods of contact. All help will\nbe appreciated.\nImperial can be a difficult place\nto be a Gay or Lesbian student so if\nyou would prefer it the University of\nLondon Union in (Mallet street) has\nan extremely well established\ngroup which meet on Thursdays at\n7.30pm in room 2D/E. Everyone, what ever their sexual\norientation, is at risk from Aids and\nother sexually transmitted diseases\nif they do not follow the \"Safe Sex\"\nguide lines. You are at risk not\nonly from Aids (For which there is\nas yet no known cure) but also\nfrom Hepatitis B.

It\nwas a great night and we raised\nabout \u00a3400 for two projects that\nare helping to protect the Brazilian\nEH FELIX l3J f ll)95 Rainforest.

The week incorporated\nsome important dates including\nWorld Aids Day on December 1 st\nand European Disabled Peoples\nDay on December 3rd. We also\nincluded the Drug Prevention Week\nwhich was from the week\nbeginning the 75th October.\nEvents during the week included\na display in the Union bookstore,\ninformation stalls in the Union and\nSherfield building, a benefit disco,\nfree information folders and the\nopportunity to meet members of\nthe welfare team and watch videos\non alcohol abuse over a free lunch.\nThere was also a Latin American\nNight organised by Third World\nFirst. Not only was it one of the\nliveliest events of the year but it\nalso raised a lot of money for\nOXFAM.\nThe weeks events were\norganised by the Union's Welfare\nCommittee and supported by\ncollege staff including the\nDisabilities Officer, Nursery staff\nand College Tutors.\nOther organisation also took\npart in the weeks activities. Groups\nsuch as the Hungerford Drug\nProject, Chelsea and Westminister\nHealth Project, Brook Advisory\nCentre, the Maz Project and AIDS\nprojects all had stalls in the Union\nand the Sherfield building.\nFolders containing condoms,\nred ribbons and many useful\ninformation sheets were distributed\nthroughout the week at the\nKensington site, St Marys and\nSilwood.\nAgain, a BIG THANK-YOU to\neveryone who made the campaign\nweek such a success.\nMinevar Kavlak\nUnion Adviser\nBar Law\nDear Owain,\nLast term I was asked to go into an\ninformal meeting with Terry Briley,\nDeputy Head of Security and a representative from the local\npolice.\nAt this meeting concern was\nexpressed about the number of\ndrink related incidents that have\nhappened [recently].\nThe Union has to do everything\nin its power to ensure that\nproblems do not occur either within\nits premises or outside, as a result\nof people drinking in Da Vinchies\nor the Traditional bar. Failure to do\nthis could result in the loss of our\nlicense and possible court\nproceedings.\nWe need to inform everyone of\npossible problems and have your\nsupport in ensuring that the licensing laws are strictly adhered to.\nThe Licensees or their\nrepresentatives on duty must:\n1. Refuse to serve anyone who,\nin their opinion, appears to be\ndrunk. If, on any occasion, we\nhave to take this decision we need\nyour support. Friends must not then\nbuy drinks for the individual\nconcerned. This action would\ncompromise them and risk the bar\nlosing its license. The most useful\naction would be for friends to rally\naround and see the person safely\nhome.\n2. Refuse entrance to anyone\nwho, in their opinion, is already\ndrunk. The Union is granted\nextensions for 'Special Occasions'\nbut if people arrive having\nobviously spent the entire evening\ndrinking elsewhere and in an\napparently inebriated state, then\nthe Stewards will have to refuse\nthem entry. They would not be\nserved at the bar anyway.\n3. Ensure that all alcohol is\nconsumed within 20 minutes if\nbar closing. This ruling applies to\nall areas including the\nEntertainments Lounge. Please help\nour Bar Staff and Stewards by\ndrinking up quickly. There can be\nno argument on this. If people do\nnot drink up in the specified time\nthen we have the legal obligation\nto take the drinks away.\nThe Union has a good\nreputation with the local police and\nthis needs to be maintained. The\nUnion Building is the busiest social\nspace with the College campus and\nWE COLLECTIVELY, need to ensure\nthat reasonable behaviour and\nadherence to the licensing laws are\nour prime considerations at all\ntimes.\nA UNION BUILDING WITHOUT\nA BAR IS NOT A PRETTY\nTHOUGHT!\nYours Sincerely,\nLucy Chothia\nICU President\nCOUNCIL MEETINGS Under the new consist uti on the governing and sovereign body of\nthe Union is Council. It is therefore very important that al\nmembers of council attend meetings. All meetings of the Union\nso any student may attend.

    "content": "ELIXIR\nThe Student Newspaper of Imperial College N0IOI6 1 3 JAN95 Arson Attack\nBY ANDREW LONG Arsonists have been blamed for\ntwo fires which last term\nwrecked havoc with festive\ncelebrations at Linstead Hall. The fires took place on Tuesday\n13th December, just a few days\nafter the Linstead Christmas\nparty.\nIn the first of the two\nincidents, fire alarms were\nactivated at 9.05pm, after foyer\nsmoke alarms were triggered. MrS. Patel, who was the first at the\nscene, discovered an ignited\nnewspaper and a burning armchair under the foyer stairs.\nWhilst removing the armchair\nhe was joined by college security\nwho extinguished the flames.\nThe second event took place\nshortly after 10pm. On smelling\nsmoke in her flat, resident\nSharine Brown rose the alarm.\nCollege security arriving on\nstaircase 3 found that the\nlighting had been switched off\nand the staircase smoke-ridden.\nThe fire brigade were called\nwhilst security and assistant\nwarden Andy Livingston used a hose reel to extinguish the\nflames. Following investigations\nat the scene police and fire\nofficials have concluded that\narsonists were to blame.\nTerry Briley, Deputy\nSecurity Manager, expressed\ngreat dissatisfaction with the\nbehaviour of those responsible.\nHowever, he was impressed by\nthe rapid evacuation of the\nbuilding. \"Everybody responded\nextremely well; the fires could\nhave been serious if not fatal,\" he\nsaid.\nJan Bradley, Warden of\nLinstead Hall, also praised\npeoples' efforts: \"Considering\nthe party atmosphere, and the\nhigh spirits, the situation was\ntackled well under the\ncircumstances.\"\nAlthough nobody was hurt\nin the incidents, the fires raise\nsome serious safety questions.\nFire alarms are due to be fitted\nin all rooms in Linstead but this\nhas been pending for some years.\nThe last major ac como di ation fire occured three years ago\nfollowing a chip pan fire in Garden Hall, after which an\nupgrade to the fire safety system\nin Southside, Weeks and\nLinstead Halls was imp li men ted. But, though the Linstead fire\nsystem was upgraded during\n1994, half a year later, the smoke\nalarm system remains\nunfinished.\nNew Constitution\nBY ANDREW LONG Imperial College Union( ICU)\nhas a new constitution after the\nbulk of it was passed by the\nGoverning Body at the end of\nlast term.

    "content": "Standby\nWes Craven's nightmares seem to\nhave a persistence quality about\nthem. Okay so he only directed\nthe first Elm Street slasher but now\nby returning to that scene he only\nmanages to show how uncontrollable the monster he unleashed\nhas become.\nThe new nightmare is a kind\nof twist on the old. This time the\noriginal actors are set in the real\nworld and play themselves;\nHeather Langenkamp screams for\nher son, Wes Craven's film writing is auto directed by his dreams\nwhilst Robert England is seemingly\ndrawn towards the blood lust of\nFreddy Krueger. It's a nice touch,\nbreaking into the dualism of the\nactor-character and then trying to\nsqueeze both of them together but\nin the case of this film series it\nonly gets lost as Freddy reappears\nto carve up more flesh and blood.\nIt's a problem which seems to\nhaunt the genre. Horror films are\nsuppose to scare us and if they\ndon't they become wearisome,\nhowever cleverly the director\nweaves his tale.\nYet the opening scenes are\nclever and scary - a horror film\nwithin a horror film based in real\nlife. This blurred aspect of reality\ncontinues to be used with effect as\nwe slip between dreams and\nwaking, earthquakes of the\nphysical and metaphysical,\nEnglund playing Freddy for the\ntalk show and Freddy playing ...\nwell, himself. But it is significant\nthat these scenes are scary\nbecause they are based on\npsychological edgings and hence\nare virtually bloodless. By the time\nthat fingers have become firm\nblades you just have to lay back\nand endure the usual clich ed cut\nand thrust of leaving the kid alone\nat the crucial moment, the clumsy\njabs of the supposedly powerful\nvillai.n which always just miss the\nheroine, the crucial 'child\nsleepwalking across a six lane\nhighway without being hit' scene\nand then on to the MFI inspired\nseven gates of hell set where the\nfinal battle has to interminably\nwork its way around to farce as\nFreddy gets killed (once again,\nagain, again, again, again ...). As\nthe film's marketing goes; \"...\nmissed me?\". Sadly I hadn't noticed that you'd ever been\naway.\nShe was an abnormal child\nthat was certain and you might\nhave thought her disadvantaged\nbut Sissy Hankshaw's thumbs were\nto be her salvation. She was born\nfor a purpose and that purpose was\nto hitchhike.\nThe opening sentiments of\neven cowgirls get the blues are\nobviously surreal and equally\nsatisfying especially when vocalise d in Uma Thurman's slow stumble.\nThat the rest of the film doesn't live\nup to the ideal maybe simply\nbecause books rarely make good\nfilms, especially new age road\nbooks. Personally I didn't find the\nbook that great either - Tom\nRobbins tends to be too self\ncongratulatory and knowing an\nauthor for my palate. Still plot, feel\nand emotional depth aside the film\nhad all the makings for a cult\nclassic - Gus van Sant's direction,\nk d lang's soundtrack, Uma\nThurman, Rain Phoenix and John\nHurt in the major roles (the latter in\ndrag as the vaginal deodorant\nqueen of america), River Phoenix as\nthe deceased dedication and\nWilliam Burroughs as the ten\nsecond cameo of New York. Even\nthe title is a sly reference to\nmasturbation although this is\nupgraded by the time the action\ngoes down on the range as the\ncowgirls are all apparently lesbian\n(or at the least bisexual). But all this\nwas before the film was shot and\nsubsequently heavily re-edited.\nReality can be a bitch.\nThere's a saying I 've always\nliked: \"life is first draft\". Means\nyou don't get to do any rewrites or\nrehearsals, and most of the time\nyou just have to make it up as you\ngo along. That's real life for you.\nHal Hartley's films are like\nthat too - not so much the product\nof craft as a brief window onto\nsomeone's life, in all its messy,\namateurish glory. Hartley's naturalistic style of directing gives\nhis work an emotional force you\njust can't ignore; funny and\npoignant by turns, his four films to\ndate have made a virtue of their\nlow budget origins and each one\nis worth any ten blockbusters\nyou'd care to mention.\nWhich brings us to Hartley's latest effort, amateur, which is\nsomething of a departure both in\nsubject matter and the size of the\nproduction. It's still a long way\nfrom Hollywood standards, but\namateur is easily Hartley's most\nambitious project to date. It's also\n(shock, horror) an action movie -but as the man says \"it's a Hal\nHartley action movie and that\nprobably means I 've got it wrong\nsomehow\".\nThe story starts with Thomas,\nan amnesiac who wakes up in a New York alley, with no ID and no\nidea how he got there. He meets\nIsabelle, an ex-nun who earns a living by writing pornography\n(honest, I'm not making this up)\nand together they begin to unravel\nthe mystery of Thomas' past. But\nwhat link does he have with Sofia,\na desperate young porn actress\nwho seems terrified of him, and\nwhy are the mob trying to kill him?\nAs per usual, Hartley uses the plot\nas a vehicle to explore important\nthemes of responsibility and love.\nCan we love someone who has\nbeen 'evil' in the past even if they\nare, quite literally, a changed\nman?\nAmateur is every bit as funny\nas Hartley's previous work, while\nthe action scenes are also well-handled, but the real attraction is\nthe compellingly realised\nrelationships between the main\ncharacters - Hartley is known as\nan actors' director, and the\nexcellent performances he pulls\nfrom the talented cast show us\nwhy. A joy to watch. \u00a9\nFELIX "

However,\nLucy Chothia, ICU President, in\nan interview with FELIX stated\nthat the new amendment\nbasically was a rewording of the\nold proposal and that she did not\nsee Council having any problems\nwith it.\nThe first new ICU Council\nmeeting will take place on\nTuesday 17th January.\nBY MIKE INGRAM Sir Eric Ash, ex-Rector of\nImperial College, has been\nappointed acting Chief Executive\nof the Student Loans Company.\nHe took over the position,\nwhich is on a part time basis, on\n16 December. The job was\npreviously held by Ron Harrison,\nwho is absent owing to ill health.\nSir Eric's task will be aided by\nColin Ward, Assistant Managing\nDirector of the Glasgow-based\ncompany, who will continue to\ndeal with day-to-day operational\ndetails. Sir Eric will be\ncontinuing in the post until further notice.\nThe Company, owned by the\nSecretaries of State for Education\nand Scotland, was set up to\nadminister the Government's much-maligned student loans\nscheme. Recently, the scheme has\ncome under attack from both\nstudent bodies and the\nopposition parties. Government\nfigures from February 1994\nshowed that more than a third of\ngraduates liable to make loan\nrepayments had been forced to\ndefer payments because of low\nincome.\nSir Eric, who joined the\nCompany in September 1994 as a non-Executive Director, was\nRector of Imperial College from\n1985 to 1993. He is currently\nProfessor of Physics at University\nCollege, London. The Company\nChairman, Ken Young, described\nhim as having \"a distinguished\nacademic career\", and said that\n\"his management experience as a director and consultant will be an\ninvaluable asset\".\n\u20ac < ii for i alEF Two Thousandths\nAh, another year is upon us. But\nbehind the complacency which\ncomes with maturity (remember\nthe trauma that came with changing from 1983 to 1984\nbrought to your schoolbooks?)\nthere is a feeling, I think, of an\nimportance to count time almost\nhourly. We are now only five\nyears from the Millennium and\nthat long awaited Timemark that\nstirs both the souls of believers\nand hearts of the cynics. We may\nsay that the year 2000 is a purely\nhuman invention unnoticed by\nthe cosmos but one cannot live in\nthe world of calendars and escape\nwithout a trace. Our concept of\ntime may be arbitrary but it\npermeates to the core.\nDespite, or because, of our\nobsession, it is difficult to obtain\nany real sense of perspective. I think the Millennium will now\nbe much more on the minds of\nthe chattering classes because we\nare 'half way there.' By this I mean halfway between 1990 and\n2000, which is how many people\nseem to view things. Nobody really says we've seen\n1995/2000'ths of the allotted time\nfloat under the bridge. But why\nsay 2000 at all? In 2100 they'll be\nlooking towards the year 3000 or\nfloating around as dust particles.\nOr maybe they'll be measuring\ntime with some weird form of\n'quantum clock' and the\nChristian Calendar will be all but\nforgotten.\nOver the Channel\nIt was with such weighty\nthoughts on my mind that I went\nto Holland over the New Years\nBreak (yeah really, nothing to do\nwith Amsterdam'ned hedonism!)\nActually, maybe it's a product of\nmy years without travel but I do\nfind going to new countries an\nexhilarating experience. When\npeople talk about how the\nEuropean capitals, for instance,\nare all the same, I can only get\nnostalgic because if they are\nsimilar now, what must they have\nbeen once? I find countries\nbristling with a subtle\nuniqueness, which might not be\nas obvious as a weird hat or a plate of some local long-lost\ndelicacy but are at least as\nintrinsic to the countries being.\nEveryone goes on about how\nlaid back the Dutch are\n(famously in Amsterdam) but\nmany ignore the fact that this\ncomes from an innate love of\nauthority, or at least a strong\nconservative respect for order in\nsociety. Trains run on time,\npeople board them on time.\nService in shops is practical,\nnever eff use. Dress is\nstraightforward (though clubs\nseem the usual dressed down\npalaces). Marijuana is smoked in\nthe red light district but nobody\ndrinks row di ly on the streets. A kingdom of sens i blis m.I pondered this as I listened\nto the canal boat captain. \"Half of\nHolland lies two to three metres\nunder water...\" This betrays what\nI think is one of the fundamental\ntruths about the country. Any nation sitting continually at the\npoint being the toddlers end of\nthe North Sea swimming pool is\nbound to have an in-built desire\nto preserve those mechanisms\nwhich keep back the sea. No government, no dry land. After\nthis, the government probably\ndoesn't need to justify itself\nmuch more. Therefore there isn't the 'wouldn't we better off\nwithout them?' questions asked\nof politicians, thus they don't act\nunreasonably seeking attention\nand sensible ness is preserved.\nAll of which makes Dam Square at twelve am New Years\nDay an interesting anomaly.\nMaybe like the ancient Romans\nthe natives of Holland understand that a civilised\nsociety must occasionally let it's hair down. Maybe everyone was\nforeign. Or maybe it was their\nready availability that resulted in\nmore fireworks flying around\nthen the latest Die Hard movie.\nPeople were hit, hair caught fire,\nsomeone was standing on a car\nheaped in ash on one corner\nwhilst another group amongst\nthe thousands broke up chairs\nand made a huge bonfire. The\npolice were absent and\nsensible ness was clearly taking a night off.\nGet Creative in1995 Why not take a break from the lectures and the television to pickup a pen( or aPC) and write for FELIX?

Porn, propaganda and, of course, music.\nI UMA began in Santa Cruz with unsigned bands offering sound bytes to anyone\nin the net community willing to listen (or\nwait for half an hour whilst the files down-loaded, and then listen...). Like many seeds\nplanted in those heady days, it blossomed\nrapidly and has attracted deals with mainstream labels such as Warner Brothers\nand Geffen, as well as less mainstream outfits.\n\"Indie bands will get the same exposure\nas say, Madonna, and be available on a more\neven basis,\" says John Loder from Southern\nStudios. \"In just three weeks, 30-40,000 people\nhad accessed the system - one of them was\nfrom the Kremlin.\"\nThe idea that the Internet will actually\nbring about a change in our listening tastes:\npromoting a catholic range and a ready ness to\ngamble on the new rather than be led by big\nmoney promo campaigns is an idea close to\nIUMA's heart. Time and again they refer to\nthe benefit that this new form of distribution\nwill have for the musicians themselves,\nbypassing the need to be signed to get your\nmusic heard. One, a baseball-capped West\nCoaster by the name of Rob, calls it 'the level\nplaying field of cyberspace'.\nOthers are more sceptical.

Others argued that encouraging the\nplacement of music on the net would\nultimately result in piracy on an awesome\nscale. This was countered with a home-taping/radio analogy which isn't really valid\nbecause that method of schoolboy law breaking results in a degradation of sound whereas\ncopying a digital sound file from one location\nto another obviously leaves the quality\nunchanged. There was talk of copyrights but I had the feeling that everyone knew the future\nwas going to have different values to the\npresent, different rules, but were trying to\nusher in this new age with the values of today.\nAfter the press conference I thought I'd get another view. Lee McLoughlin, of the\nDepartment of Computing's support group,\nwas sceptical of the value of any encryption\nroutine: \"Eventually speakers must play the\nsound, you can always tap onto this.\" He\nhighlighted DAT machines, which avoid\nhome-piracy with an agreement that all\nDAT' s will be unable to copy other DAT recordings.
