It shows the\nunlikeliest of people coming together\nforming an alliance, and the initial\nstruggle shown in the film for the\ntwo groups to bond is somewhat of a\npredictable starting point.\nIn fact, once you get to know the\ngeneral plot synopsis, the entire gist\nof the film can be played out easily.\nFirst there is the struggle for the\nmore flamboyant gays and lesbians\nto integrate into the conservative\nWelsh community, but after a few\nspeeches and memorable events,\nthere is a breakdown in prejudice and\nignorant hate, with the two groups\ncoming together in a touching display\nof unity to march together for rights.\nThere is absolutely nothing new here,\nbut because of the way this story is\ntold and presented, Pride works to a\nsurprisingly stirring and hilarious\nlevel.\nIt starts off as a pet project for\nMark (Ben Schnetzer \u2013 an American\nactor who flawlessly gets by with his\nWelsh accent), marching at a Gay\nPride event of 1984. Noticing that\nthe \u201cmining community is being\nbullied, just like we [gays and lesbians]\nare\u201d, it is that classic notion of \u201cthe\nenemy of my enemy is a friend\u201d that\ngives him the idea to support the\nminers. Of course, it is support that\nno one asked for, and no one really\nwants. At the height of homophobia\nin Britain, very few people are\nwilling to associate with individuals\nbranded as \u201c perverts\u201d. But one mining\nvillage in Wales is welcome to have\nthem around, and accept their\ngenerous donations. Schnetzer plays\ndetermined and stubborn well, the\nkind of attitude that gets things done,\nbut also is prone to attract trouble too.\nAmong the more forward-thinking,\nopen-minded people in Wales are Dai\n(Paddy Considine), who first meet the\ngroup and decide to give them a place\nto stay in his living room, Cliff (Bill\nNighy) and Hefina (Imelda Staunton),\nwho are essentially the elders of the\ncommunity, Gwen (Menna Trussler),\nwho has some innocent but hilarious\nquestions about lesbians, and Sian\n(Jessica Gunning), a housewife and\nmother who takes interest in the\nvillage politics. But for every man\nand woman who is happy to welcome\nthem with open arms, there are those\nwho are actively resistant to their\ninput.\nThe initial struggling period is\nmarred with ups and downs. Among\nthe happier events is a scene in which\nJonathan (Dominic West), a member\nof LGSM (Lesbians and Gays Support\nthe Miners), starts taking over the\ndance floor with his funky moves.\nYou would never expect someone like\nWest to be in such a goofy role, but\nhe is perfect in it. Never too over-the-top to be reduced to a simplistic\ncaricature, but a well-written\ncharacter who has more to say and do\nthan just have one highlight dance\nsequence; it just so happens that West\ndancing to \u2018Shame Shame Shame\u2019 is so\nunexpected that it is that much more\nenjoyable.\nMainly told from the point of view\nof Joe (George MacKay), a young\nman recently coming to terms with\nhis homosexuality, all the strange,\nwonderful, new things experienced\nby him are directly shown to the\naudience. His first Pride march in\nwhich there are objects being thrown\nat them, plus a sign that reads \u201c burn\nin hell\u201d, his first party, first charity\ncollection, first kiss, and frequent\nadventures to Wales that open his\neyes to the bigger outside world,\nall the while falling behind on his\ncooking studies whilst following his\npassion. MacKay is a pleasantly doe-eyed, innocent-looking addition to\nhave as a lead, providing a fresh set of\neyes on what is happening. Unlike the\nother members of LGSM, Joe is a shy,\ninsecure youngster who ends up in\nthe group by pure chance. But as his\nconfidence grows and he starts taking\ncharge of his own future, you see the\npersonal journey of self-discovery\nin Joe, in the midst of the progress\nLGSM makes with the miners.\nSpeaking of personal journeys,\nanother heart-warming plot strand\nbelongs to Gethin (Andrew Scott, of\nthe Sherlock fame), a gay bookstore\nowner who has not been back to\nhis home town in Wales for fear of\njudgement from his mother. Scott\nappears to be a master at giving the\nsmallest of looks and twitches on\nhis face, and yet portraying so many\nemotions at the same time. He has\na relatively smaller role, even in the\ntrailers and posters he is sidelined,\nbut he is excellent in every scene that\nis focused to his character.\nThe Welsh women have more fun\nthan their male counterparts in the\nfilm, with a group of them, led by\nHefina and Gwen visiting gay clubs\nin London, pushing their way in\ndespite it there being a \u201cmen only\u201d\npolicy. \u201cOh don\u2019t be daft\u201d says Hefina,\nas they dance away with gay men.\nStaunton as always, is spectacular,\nbringing a whole load of fun energy\ninto the mix, acting as a matriarch\nof sorts, helping with the smooth\ntransition of outsiders coming into\ntheir tightly-knit community, always\nstanding firm on the issue of equality.\nHefina is an admirable character\nplayed by an actress who is on top\nof her game. Gwen provides healthy\nsupport, always providing great\nlaughs, with Jessica Gunning also as\na younger wife, but by no means less\nimpassioned, having her moment to\nshine.\nThere is a lot to squeeze in. Each\ncharacter has something profound\nto say and go through, but even\nfleeting shots of their lives are\nenough to provide the tears and the\nlaughs. Despite having fun with the\nsubject, the film never forgets to the\naddress the more serious, darker side\nto this movement. Not everything\nwent smoothly, there were those\nwilling to take down the LGSM\nmovement using devious methods.\nWe do get hate crime taking place,\ncomplications arising, and given how\nthe miners\u2019 strike ended, you get the\nfeeling that not everyone has a happy\nending coming for them. Pride shows\nthat no matter how much something\nmakes sense, and no matter how\nmany brilliant minds and genuine\npeople get together to back it up,\nsometimes things just are not meant\nto be.\nHowever the film does find a way\nto finish on a joyous note. One that\nmirrors the 1984 Pride march shown\nearlier in the film, but this time with\nan extra twist. A twist that will surely\nhave your heart melting at the sight\nof human kindness, compassion and\nfriendship. Being kind to one another,\nit seems, worked out well for the\ncharacters of Pride.\n\"It just so\nhappens\nthat West\ndancing\nto 'Shame\nShame\nShame' is\nso unexpected that\nit is that\nmuch more\nenjoyable.\"\nPhoto: horrorcultfilms\nPhoto: hamburg-news Photo: hitfix\n\n"

In 2014 he was awarded the\n$1M Kavli Prize by the Norwegian\nAcademy of Science and Letters\nin recognition of his work in the\nfield of nano-optics. This article is a\nsummary of an interview for Felix\nthat took place on September 26,\n2014.\nBen: So, would you mind telling me\na little bit about yourself and your\nwork?\nJohn: Well, I started here in 1981, but\nthankfully they still pay me so I guess\nI must still be considered worthwhile!\nWhen I arrived here I was\ninterested in surface structure and\ncatalysis. I worked on electron\ndiffraction data and surface\ncrystallography, before looking at\nhow waves move in disordered solids.\nThis is a really difficult thing to do,\nand most of my work was ignored at\nthe time and is only now coming to\nthe fore.\nOne result that was really\nimportant from all this came\nabout when I was looking at the\ntransmission of light through\ndisordered materials \u2013 those where\nthe light isn\u2019t absorbed, but also isn\u2019t\ntransmitted because it\u2019s all scattered\naway. An example would be, say, a\nbottle of snow.\nI was able to show that this was\na bit like a maze, in that there was\none particular path along which all\nthe light was transmitted through\nsuch a medium. Obviously, this can\nmassively increase the transmission\ncoefficient (the amount of light\nhitting the detector compared to the\namount incident).\nThis result was only tested about\nthree years ago, but a Dutch Group\nwere able to increase this coefficient\nby a factor of 10,000. One thing that\nwe\u2019re looking at now is whether this\ntechnique might be adapted to enable\nbetter medical imaging through a\nperson\u2019s skin.\nIn the mid-90\u2019s, I moved on\nto looking at optics, specifically\nphotonic crystals. These are weird\ncrystals which are black at certain\nfrequencies not because they absorb\nlight but because they don\u2019t let any\nlight in. I like to say that you couldn\u2019t\nlight a match inside one because\nthere\u2019d be nowhere for the light to go.\nThis led on to working for the\nMarconi Company, looking at\nmaterials used for radar absorption\non warships. They knew that the\ncarbon fibres were absorbing radar\nwell, but didn\u2019t know why. After\ndoing some work on this, it turned\nout that the key wasn\u2019t that the\nmaterial was made from carbon, but\nrather that it had a fibrous nature.\nUnlike most materials that you\nmight encounter, this meant that the\nstructure and not the composition\nwas the main determinant of the\nmaterial\u2019s properties. Another good\nexample is silver \u2013 crystalline silver\nis highly reflective, but in granular\nform silver appears black.\nWe called this new class of\nmaterials \u2018metamaterials\u2019. The\nstructure of the metamaterials was\nactually altering their physical\nproperties, and they allowed\nus to realise things that might\notherwise have not been possible.\nIn optics you\u2019re always constrained\nby the available materials, but\nmetamaterials raised the prospect of a\nwhole new science.\nOne such class of materials would\nhave negative refractive indicies.\nWhat would this mean? Well all sorts\nof weird things would happen: the\nmaterial would behave like a lens. It\n\"Well\nall sorts\nof weird\nthings\nwould\nhappen: the\nmaterial\nwould\nbehave like\na lens. \"\n\"Well, I\nstarted here\nin 1981, but\nthankfully\nthey still pay\nme so I guess\nI must still\nbe considered\nworthwhile!\"\nPhoto: Imperial College\n\n"

I am\nplanning to turn up rocking\nmy whips and a zimmer\nframe.\nTickets: \u00a38.50 online, \u00a39.50 on\nthe door\nTickets include four beers or\nbombs\nLast week we ran two stories\nthat we were worried (or did\nwe hope?) would cause a storm.\nOne was covering the amenities funds\ncut, and the other was looking at the\nfirst non-alocoholic bar night ran by\nImperial College Union. Surprisingly,\nthe latter story is the one that is\nseemingly kicking up a storm.\nWe are running a whole page this\nweek dedicated to the news story that\nonly warrented about 200 words in\nthe first place, most of which were\ntounge in cheek.\nOur journalistic prowess has come\nunder attack, with a lot of it to do\nwith the \u201cillustrative\u201d photo we used\nto accompany the article. Apparently\nour credit (or lack of, as it were, for\nthe front page thumbnail version)\nwas not enough to explain how the\nphoto was not a completely correct\nrepresentation of the entirity of the\nnight.\nHonestly, I thought it was hilarious,\nand I am sure that at some point they\ndid indeed sweep Metric that night.\nLet\u2019s use this as the lesson that taught\nus that photos may be louder than\nwords, and also that we love to rub the\nUnion up the wrong way every now\nand then.\nAs I actually graduated last year\n(picture related), this Wednesday I\nspent the day popping in and out of\nthe Office congratulating friends and\ntrying to help my Section Editors at\nthe same time. Credit to them, we\nactually managed to make this issue\nwith time to spare, a rare occurance\nin the production of the Felix\nnewspaper.\nIn other news from the Felix Office,\nwe are so, so close to completion. We\nare just waiting for the infamous\nsemi-circular desk to appear, which\nshould arrive Monday. We have a\ndictophone now, so can start running\nwire taps into the office of Chris Kaye,\nDeputy President (Betrayal). We also\nhave lots of stationary that we have\nstolen from the Union in the dead of\nthe night when the newspaper layout\ngets too much. If anyone needs any\npost-it notes, give us a shout.\nFinally, we saw the launch of our\namazing, brand new website last\nweek. Personally, I was dozing in the\ncorner after a particularly stressful\nsubmission of the paper the night\nbefore, but I heard that it all went\nsmoothly and was launched on time.\nWe are still uploading articles onto\nthe site a few batches at a time. The\nentire pdfs of each issue are still\nthere to have a scroll through, in case\nyou want to relive the shadow-dick\nphenomenon from Issue 1583.\nIf you want to see it in all its glory\ntoo (the centrefold itself, not the\nactual penis shadow), come down\nto the Office. You might as well ask\nus how you can get involved whilst\nyou're here.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nSKETT\u2019S BOX OF SHAME\nApologies for some mistakes in Issue\n1584. These were:\n- Missing some copy editors off the\nroll call on the editorial page due to a\nformatting hitch\n- The DramSoc advert, the iPOP\nadvert and the photo in Televion\nwere of a terrible quality, due to\na technical di\ufb03culty that occured\nas we sent the issue to print. We\napologise.\n- Losing the font for Diary of a\nFresher and having to use one that\nis more akin to a secondary school\nhomework piece then a satire section\nof a newspaper.\nCURRENT FELIX VACANCIES\nWe are looking for a new team of\nWeb Editors, to manage online\ncontent, approve comments, keep our\nsite in check and get everything onto\nthe website by Friday afternoon.\nIf you enjoy website management,\nhave used the internet before or just\nreally want some free stationary,\ncome down to the Office or get in\ntouch and we can show you the ropes.\nDon\u2019t know how computers work?\nWe don\u2019t either, so don\u2019t worry about\nhaving any prior experience.\nEmail us if you are keen:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 11\n24.10.2014\nFELIX\nEditor Philippa Skett\nFeatures Editor VACANT\nFeatures\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cOnce I had\nthe Harry\nPotter\naspect under\ncontrol, it was\nmuch simpler\nto get people\ninterested\u201d\nwouldn\u2019t even need to be shaped, a\nsimple slab of it could do the job.\nI was working on this one\nSunday morning (which as Head of\nDepartment sometimes feels like\nthe only time you get to do your own\nresearch!) when I realised that the\nlens could be \u2018perfect\u2019 \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be\nlimited to resolving things the size\nof the wavelength as normal lenses\nare \u2013 it\u2019d be something quite new and\nextraordinary.\nFor a while I thought that I must\nhave made a mistake somewhere.\nEveryone agreed, but no one could\nfind the mistake. So eventually I\npublished the paper under the rather\nprovocative title The Perfect Lens.\nThat was back in 2000, and there was\na big storm over it. Lots of people got\nvery upset, and even now continue to\ninsist that I was wrong. But they\u2019re\njust digging holes, and as the holes get\ndeeper their voices get fainter.\nIn the end that became my most\nfamous (or infamous!) paper, and is\nat over 5,000 citations and counting.\nThe lens we\u2019d come up with broke the\nLaw of Abbe, which says that the size\nof the wavelength is the best that you\ncan do in optics.\nUsing things that you\u2019d ordinarily\nthink were not lens-like at all, like\nmetallic silver, we were able to\nincrease light intensity by factors of\nup to 100,000. This is getting on for\nwhat a laser can do. But our nanoscale\nconcentrations of light would be far\nless expensive and dangerous than a\nhigh-power laser.\nThese incredibly intense\nconcentrations of light lead us to\nanother amazing thought. Light\ndoesn\u2019t normally \u2018switch\u2019 with itself.\nWhat I mean is that two photons\nrarely interact in a useful manner.\nElectrons are very good at this,\nthey can scatter off each other, and\nmodern electronics work off this\nprinciple. But with light, in order\nto get it to interact you normally\nhave to change it into an electron,\nthen interact with it before changing\nit back into a photon. But at these\nintense concentrations, light might\nbegin to interact with itself \u2013 we could\npossibly make routing switches and\noptical chips, maybe even one day\nwe\u2019ll be able to do computing with\nlight.\nTo properly understand this, we\nhave to throw away Snell\u2019s law and\ngo back to Maxwell\u2019s Equations.\nIn fact, let\u2019s go all the way back\nto Einstein. He talked about how\nspace can be stretched or squashed,\nand that light rays are affected by\nthis distortion. Now we know that\nMaxwell\u2019s equations differ from\nSnell\u2019s law in that they deal with\nfields of force, rather than rays. How\ndo the field lines behave when space\ngets distorted?\nWell, it turns out they behave like\nthey\u2019re embedded in space. I like to\nthink of this as wires in a rubber sheet\n(the kind that people often use to\nvisualise space) \u2013 they move with the\ndistortion. So we can control light be\nstretching and pulling space. That\u2019s\nall good, but we can\u2019t really pull space\nat will, we\u2019re not black holes.\nIt turns out that we don\u2019t need to.\nWe can use General Relativity to\nwrite down Maxwell\u2019s equations in\na different format, and the metric\n(a measure of how squashed space\nis) sits exactly where we\u2019d expect\nthe refractive index to sit in the\nequations. So we don\u2019t need to squash\nspace to make like switch, rather\nwe can do this just by changing the\nrefractive index that the light\u2019s in,\nwhich has the same effect as changing\nthe distortion of the space the light\nis in.\nIt turns out that the materials you\nneed to do this are rather exotic,\nand have negative refractive indices.\nNow most people wouldn\u2019t light\nup when they saw this set of partial\ndifferential equations, but it turns\nout that they let us design a cloaking\ndevice. The field lines deviate, they\ndon\u2019t go through the object but also\ndon\u2019t scatter away \u2013 they come back\ntogether on the far side of the object.\nOnce I had the Harry Potter aspect\nunder control, it made it much\nsimpler to get people interested.\nThe outreach has been fun, and the\nwork has led to me being awarded\nthe Kavli Prize for this so-called\n\u2018transformation optics\u2019.\nRecently we\u2019ve been looking\nto concentrate light in more\ninteresting ways, using more complex\ntransformations. We can even do\nan inversion, which basically turns\nthings inside out.\nImagine that we have a slab of\nsilver, and then the electrons in the\nsilver form waves on the surface of\nthe sea of delocalised electrons.\nWe call these surface plasmons. A\nmolecule at the surface will radiate\nplasmons off to infinity, but if we\ndo an inversion suddenly the points\nswap around.\nThe infinity becomes the origin,\nand vice versa. Because we change the\nenergy scale, the light at the point of\norigin gets slower and slower as the\nenergy from infinity piles up. We can\nbasically crush light to intensities a\nmillion times more than what we had\nbefore.\nBy doing different mathematical\ntransformations on the silver, we can\ncreate all sorts of different structures.\nIn fact, we\u2019ve been able to make a\nradar dish that weighs a few hundred\ngrams, where a conventional concave\nlens would weigh ten or twenty times\nas much. We have a \u2018flat lens\u2019 that\nrefracts differently at its centre to\nat its edge, thus allowing us to focus\nlight. This was commissioned by\nBoeing, and looks like a poppadom.\nOther companies like Toyota are\ninterested in these because they\nmight be able to use them in collision\navoidance radar in driverless cars\n\u2013 the reduced size compared to a\nconventional lens would bring all\nsorts of advantages.\nWe\u2019ve also been looking into\ndeveloping phased radar arrays,\nwhich instead of sweeping a beam\naround the sky simply sit on a silicon\nblock that delivers the right phase\nof light to the lens. When a specific\nphase hits a specific part of the lens\nit sends the light in a particular\ndirection.\nThese could be a lot cheaper and\nplug into a USB port, so Bill Gates is\ninterested as it might enable internet\naccess to be brought to remote\ncommunities, for example in Africa.\nOr we might be able to use this to do\nMRI scans that are less risky as there\nare no RF fields going all over the\nplace that can heat things up in your\nbody.\nB: Wow. That's quite a set of\nachievements! I don't even know\nwhere to start or what to ask. I'll\nneed some time to think about it\nI guess. For now though, just one\nquestion: are you hoping to get any\nmore invites from Scandinavian\nAcademies, perhaps to Stockholm?\nJ: I would like to have a flat in central\nLondon one day, so that would be\nnice! I had a lovely week in Norway\nwhen I won the Kavli, so we\u2019ll see\nwhat happens next.\nB: Good luck! We'll be in touch.\n\"So\neventually\nI published\nthe paper\nunder the\nrather\nprovocative\ntitle The\nPerfect\nLens.\"\n\"The\noutreach\nhas been\nfun,\nand the\n[invisibility\ncloak] work\nhas led to\nme being\nawarded\nthe Kavli\nPrize\"\n\n"

Therefore, it\ncomes as no surprise that a zombie-obsession that started in 1968 with\nthe release of Romero\u2019s epic Night\nof the Living Dead and brought us\nfilms like 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks\nLater, the rest of the Romero saga and\nResident Evil: Apocalypse (I refuse to\nacknowledge the rest of the series) has\nmassively hit the small screen.\nMore of the same medicine, some\nmight say, and there is some truth\nto that. However, shows such as Z\nNation, Town of the Living Dead and\nthe more celebrated and raved about\nThe Walking Dead definitely have\nsomething to add. Viewers even seem\nto want more, as series focusing on\nsimple deadly epidemic scenarios, I\u2019m\nthinking The Last Ship or The Strain,\nare also gaining popularity.\nZ Nation and Town of the Living\nDead are both part of the network\nSyfy\u2019s Thursday night zombie-fest. The first is a slightly less\nsophisticated version of The Walking\nDead. Writers haven\u2019t bothered\nwith providing a pre-zombie look\ninto the characters persona or the\nante-apocalyptic world in general.\nElectricity still seems to be working\nin many cases, with lifts casually\noperating like an everyday Monday at\nthe office.\nDon\u2019t let these details bother you\nhowever, because the show actually\nprovides excellent gore (admittedly\nthe zombie baby was a gross misuse of\nCGI, and unfortunately it became one\nof the promotional pictures\u2026) and\ninteresting relationship plots.\nTown of the Living Dead, on the\nother hand, is a harmless attempt\nat a living-dead-comedy-improv.\nAnd why not, I say? Well, because\nunfortunately, when you take the\ndrama out of the apocalypse, it turns\nout that, as a situation, it is hard to\nsqueeze any comedy out of it.\nThe Strain is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s\nspin on the apocalyptic scenario,\nand as such definitely has some\ninteresting moments. However,\nvampire zombies is a bit much. The\nLast Ship is a different story entirely.\nBased on a ship sent out to see at\nthe beginning of an epidemic to\ndevelop a vaccine, the show boasts\ngreat performances by British actress\nRhona Mitra (who also starred in\nthe apocalyptic Doomsday, probably\nthe chavviest movie ever made) and\nsex god Eric Dane. I am not kidding,\nif you enjoyed his performance as\nMcSteamy in Grey\u2019s Anatomy, you\nprobably won\u2019t be disappointed to see\nhim in a uniform.\nSo, can we expect this trend to\ndecline soon? Eric Dane aside, the\nend of the world is an attractive\nscenario. The spread of an infection\npoints at the downfalls of our society.\nReal monsters are often normal\nhealthy humans. Emotions are\nheightened. Friendships are born\nbetween implausible characters.\nPower-struggles, desperate romances\nand plots to save loved ones make\nfor a good story. Writers are going\nto continue exploiting this source\nof creative richness for a while. So,\nas Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s character is\nZombieland would say, \u201cFasten your\nseatbelts, it\u2019s going to be a bumpy\nride.\u201d\nPhoto: horrorsociety\nPhoto: hollywoodreporter\nPhoto: thecalifornian\nPhoto: moviepilot\nComing soon in future issues of Felix TV...\nPhoto: screenrant Photo: screenrant Photo: deadline Photo: zap2it Photo: cinemablend\nAmerican Horror Story: Freak Show\nNot exactly the most politically\ncorrect title for a television show, not\nthat Ryan Murphy ever cared about\nsomething like that. Once again,\nfollowingthetraditionoftheAmerican\nHorror Story anthology, the cast is full\nof recognisable, talented names, and\nthe setting is suitably bloody, twisted\nand downright bizarre. Will this\nlive up to the highs of Murder House,\nAsylum and avoid the low of Coven?\nGotham\nA prequel to the Batman saga, we\nfollow Detective James Gordon trying\nto keep order in the dark, damp,\ncorrupt city of Gotham. Young Bruce\nWayne sees his parents gunned down\nin the pilot episode, and Detective\nGordon is assigned to solve the case.\nThe show will also involve origins\nstoriesofmanyiconicBatman villains,\nsuch as Penguin, Riddler, Catwoman,\nJoker, Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, etc.\nState of Affairs\nKatherine Heigl, after starring in\ndisappointing rom-coms, returns to\nwhat made her famous television. She\nplays a CIA analyst who is responsible\nfor delivering \u201c The List\u201d to the\nPresident of the United States (Alfre\nWoodard), containing the top ten\nmost critical threats the country is\nfacing. A political conspiracy thriller,\nit is yet to be seen whether this will put\nHeigl\u2019s name back on the map.\nMadam Secretary\nWho says there is no good writing for\nwomen in television? T\u00e9a Leoni plays\nElizabeth McCord, the new Secretary\nof State who comes aboard after the\nprevious Secretary\u2019s sudden death.\nEach episode deals with interesting,\ncomplex international crises of some\nsorts, ones that the writers guide us\nthrough, and Leoni plays the role with\nenough serious, stoic energy, and just\nthe right amount of humour.\nThe Flash\nThe superhero genre is no doubt\nsaturated wherever we look, but\nnetwork channel CW is posting some\ngreat numbers with The Flash, a\nspinoff show from another of its hit\nshow, Arrow. A freak accident leaves\nBarry Allen (Grant Gustin) with\nsuperhuman speed, something he uses\nto serve the public good. Will there be\na crossover between the two shows?\nNever say never.\n24.10.2014\n\n"

And\nwe all know that when siblings get\ntogether, it does not take long for all\nhell to break loose, with hurt feelings,\nsibling rivalry, years of jealousy and\nresentment starting to bubble up as\nevery minute passes under the roof.\nAs the matriarch, Hillary (Jane\nFonda) grounds her four children\nfor the next seven days as they sit\nshivva for the dead dad. The four\nchildren who gather are Paul (Corey\nStoll), Wendy (Tina Fey), Judd (Jason\nBateman), and Phillip (Adam Driver).\nEach remaining Altman member has\ndrama and baggage of their own to\nhandle, which is what makes up the\nrunning time, on the background of a\nfamily tragedy.\nPaul and his wife Annie (Kathryn\nHahn), who used to date Judd, are\nstruggling to get pregnant. Wendy\nis a mother of two with a husband\n(Aaron Lazar) more preoccupied\nwith his work than family, Judd is\nreeling from the affair his wife Quinn\n(Abigail Spencer) had with his sleazy\nboss Wade (Dax Shepherd), and\nPhillip is a playboy who may or may\nnot have found the perfect woman in\ntherapist Tracy (Connie Britton). And\nHillary? Well she is the mother kids\nare embarrassed of being with, given\nhow she goes around saying things\nlike \u201cthe man was hung\u201d about her\ndead husband.\nThe crowded cast list does not\nend there. Judd gets a new romantic\ninterest with Penny (Rose Byrne)\nthe sort-of high school sweetheart of\nhis, who is now teaching in a local ice\nskating rink, and Horry (Timothy\nOlyphant), an old flame of Wendy\u2019s\nis still living across the street from\nthe Altmans with his mother Linda\n(Debra Monk). And there is a good\nreason to explain this.\nThere is arguably way too much\nhistory here to catch up on, with\neveryone vying for some coherent\nstory time. So instead of delving\ndeeply into each sibling, we only get\nfleeting shots and vague ideas of what\nhappened between everyone.\nIt is a shame the film decides to pull\naway at all the wrong moments. For\ninstance, Wendy has a significant\npast story with Horry, something that\nsignals heartbreak given how Wendy\ndeclares that she will never love\nsomeone the way she did Horry. And\nin a rare, more dramatic role, Fey\ndoes excel. She even gets the chance\nto throw a good punch to protect the\nAltman name. But there is a sense\nThis week at Imperial Cinema\nDisney and arthouse cinema are\nnot two words that are often used\nin the same sentence but this week\nwe are bringing you an exciting\n(and slightly random) double bill\nfeaturing both!\nMaleficent\nDirector: Robert Stormberg\nScreenplay: Linda Woolverton\nCast: Angelina Jolie,Elle Fanning\nEveryone knows the story of Sleeping\nBeauty: girl is cursed to prick her\nfinger on a spinning wheel,falls\ninto a deep sleep,gets saved by\nher prince charming,yadda yadda\nyadda.Maleficent tells the story from\nthe perspective of the powerful fairy\nwho placed the curse on Aurora\nin the first place.In a clever,and\nvisually spectacular reworking of the\nclassic fairytale,Maleficent (played\nby Angelina Jolie) becomes more\nthan just a 2-dimensional villain.\nShowing18:30Tuesday28thand21:45\nThursday30th\nBoyhood\nDirector: Richard Linklater\nScreenplay: Richard Linklater\nCast: Ellar Coltrane,Ethan Hawke,\nPatricia Arquette\nYou're unlikely to ever see another\nfilm like Boyhood.Director Richard\nLinklater filmed over a 12-year\nperiod with the same cast to chart\none boy's journey from early\nchildhood to late adolescence.\nThrough his eyes,we see Mason's\ndysfunctional family unit morph\nas his mother (Patricia Arquette)\njumps from one bad relationship\nto another whilst his errant,\ncharismatic father (Ethan Hawke)\nintermittently enters his life.As\nMason grows up,he displays a\nperceptive wisdom beyond his years\nand it becomes clear that his parents\nmight be the ones that are more in\nneed of growing up.\nBoyhoodis devoid of stagey\ncathartic moments and instead\nchronicles the everyday events of\nlife: riding a bike,school,falling in\nlove.Under Linklater's naturalistic\ndirection,these seemingly mundane\nmoments always feel engaging and\ntrue to life.\nNo matter how far removed your\nlife is from Mason's,it's impossible\nnot to see personal instances that\nyou can identify with.Linklater turns\nwhat could have been a directional\ngimmick into a completely authentic\nway to bring realism onto the screen;\nthe characters literally grow up in\nfront of your eyes.\nThe result? Boyhood is an\nastonishing achievement that feels\nless like a film and more like an\nobservation of a young life.Showing\n20:30Tuesday28thand18:30Thursday\n30th.\nDirector: Shawn Levy\nScreenplay: Jonathan Tropper\nCast: Jason Bateman, Tina Fey,\nJane Fonda, Corey Stoll\nthat this underdeveloped history\nbetween Wendy and Horry are going\nto waste.\nWhat blossoms between Penny\nand Judd also seem rushed. Being\nthe principle character, Judd needs\nto have a way to get a happy ending.\nPenny is pushed in front of the\ncameras to act all smiley and nice\nwith Judd, without giving these two\ncharacters much context to work\nwith.\nOf course when brothers get\ntogether, there is bound to be a\nphysical fight of some sorts. Insults\nfly and tempers flare up, especially\nwhen Paul tends to have anger issues\nand the youngest Phillip gets a kick\nout of baiting his older brother, not\nso dissimilar to how August: Osage\nCounty shows its meltdown, in one of\nthe film\u2019s more dramatic moments.\nThe cast performs exceptionally\nwell, starting all the way from\nthe matriarch, right down to the\nchildren and their significant love\ninterests. Fonda is hilarious as\nthe inappropriate mother having\nundergone a brand new boob-job,\nand the veteran actress still has what\nit takes to command the screen in\nher strong performance, although\nthe final reveal in her character is\nsomething so poorly managed that no\nactress could have made it work to a\nconvincing level.\nThe tender moments come and go,\nmuch like the memorable comedic\nscenes, but there is simply not enough\nof either to truly satisfy even in just\none aspect of the film. As family\ndramedies go, Shawn Levy\u2019s This is\nWhere I Leave You tells a very average\nstory about being a middle-aged\nadult, one that is elevated by a great\ncast of big names.\nPhoto: youtube\nPhoto: screencrave\nPhoto: wired Photo: gimlifilm\n\n"

Photo: myelomapennstate\nUtsav Radia looks at research at Imperial on DTP3\u2019s therapeutic potential\nGraphene sensors used to study brain activity\nIt seems there is no limit to the usefulness of graphene.\nIn the few short years since its discovery,scientists\nand engineers have come up with countless ways that\nthis two-dimensional form of carbon could transform\nour lives: graphene computer chips,graphene solar\ncells,graphene drug delivery systems\u2013even graphene\ncondoms.\nA group of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania\nhave added to this list by devloping a device which\ncould significantly improve our current techniques for\nstudying the electrical activity of brain tissue.\nTo accurately investigate the cause of certain\nneurological disorders,such as epilepsy,it\u2019s often\nnecessary to obtain highly detailed information of the\nlocations and electrical activity of individual neurones\nin a patient. This is usually done by placing metallic\nelectrodes on the surface of the brain,but these are\nopaque and can obstruct the doctor\u2019s view of the brain\ntissue.\nUsing graphene electrodes solves this problem,as\ngraphene is so thin that it is completely transparent.\nIt's also one of the best conductors we know of,and so\nproduces very little noise in the signals received. And,\nunlike metallic electrodes,they have the added benefit\nof being invisible on MRI scans.\nThe authors of the paper,published inNature\nCommunications,used their device to obtain extremely\nhigh resolution information on individual cells involved\nin seizures in rats,although it could easily be scaled up\nto look at larger regions of tissue.\nThis device could easily be used in implants,not just\nin the brain,but also in to monitor electrical activity\nthe peripheral nervous system and the heart.And\nbecause graphene is extremely inert,these implants\nare expected to last longer than conventional metallic\nones.\nDOI: 10.1038/ncomms6258\nJAMES BEZER\nScientists at Imperial, led by\nProfessor Guido Franzoso,\nhave developed a new drug\nto be used in patients with multiple\nmyeloma, a rare type of cancer\naffecting 4,800 new people every year\nin the UK.\nMultiple myeloma results from the\nproliferation of cancerous antibody-secreting cells (called neoplastic\nplasma cells) in bone marrow and\nother tissues.\nPhysiologically, these plasma cells\nare responsible for synthesising\nprotective immunoglobulins (a\nfamily of proteins that include\nantibodies) in response to a specific\nantigen (which is usually foreign).\nHowever, in a cancerous state, these\nplasma cells start to secrete lots of\nabnormal (and often immature)\nimmunoglobulin molecules, known\nas paraproteins.\nPatients with multiple myeloma\nusually present with bone pain or a\npathological fracture. Others may\neven present with symptoms of\nblurred vision (that may result from\nhyperviscosity of the blood due to\nhigh levels of paraprotein), kidney\ndamage, anaemia or even infection.\nInterestingly, in the early stages,\nmultiple myeloma usually doesn\u2019t\ncause any symptoms and it is usually\npicked up after a routine blood or\nurine test, when the presence of\nthe abnormal immunoglobulins is\ndetected.\nThe clinical and pathological\nfeatures of multiple myeloma are\nmainly due to direct effects of the\ntumour (bone invasion or fractures),\nmetabolic effects of the neoplastic\ncells (high plasma uric acid and\ncalcium), the damaging effects of\nthe paraprotein (such as peripheral\nneuropathy or renal failure) and\nimpaired immunity as a result of\nreduced healthy immunoglobulins.\nCurrently, multiple myeloma is\ntreated with two aims in mind: to help\nto keep the myeloma under control\nand to help with symptom relief.\nTreatment combinations to control\nthe myeloma usually consist of three\nclasses of drugs: a chemotherapy\ndrug (e.g. cyclophosphamide), a\ncorticosteroid (e.g. prednisolone) and\neither thalidomide or velcade.\nUnfortunately, often patients tend\nto relapse in which case additional\nanti-myeloma treatments have to be\ngiven, adding to the plethora of side\neffects that patients experience.\nResearchers at Imperial have\nreported laboratory findings that\nshow the new drug, DTP3, kills\nmyeloma cells in human cells and\nmice without causing any toxic side\neffects. The drug uses a completely\ndifferent mechanism of action\ncompared to other cytotoxic drugs.\nDTP3 targets a biochemical step in\na process called the NF-kB pathway,\nwhich is involved in switching off\nthe normal cellular mechanisms that\nnaturally lead to cell death, hence\nprolonging (cancerous) cell survival.\nProfessor Franzoso, lead scientist\nof the study, explained \u201cwe had\nknown for many years that NF-kB\nis very important for cancer cells,\nbut because it is needed by healthy\ncells, we did not know how to block it\nspecifically...blocking [this specific]\npathway with our DTP3...[that]\nselectively kills myeloma cells could\noffer a completely new approach to\ntreating patients\u201d.\nFurther work is now being done\nto commercialise DTP3 and other\ncandidate drugs based on Professor\nFranzoso\u2019s research to ensure the\nquickest and safest way to administer\nthis treatment in patients with\nmultiple myeloma. A trial of this\ndrug, funded by the MRC, US\nNational Institutes of Health and\nCancer Research UK is due to take\nplace in late 2015.\n\n"

If you haven't,\nplease try and have at least a little\nbit to eat, even if it's just some fruit,\na few almonds, or an egg. I know\nsometimes, it might feel like a\nmonumental effort to take care of\nyourself, especially if you've been\nhaving an off day, but your physical\nhealth is important and neglecting it\nwill only lead to more exhaustion.\nSleep\nAlong the same lines, have you had\nenough sleep? Sleep deprivation,\nespecially when it becomes a frequent\nhabit, can have a terrible effect\non both your mood and physical\nhealth. If you've been struggling\nwith insomnia for a while, it might\nbe a sign of something bigger at\nwork, so you might want to consider\nconsulting your GP.\nAlso, your health is much more\nimportant than your grades! If\nyou're having problems with time\nmanagement, try consulting that one\nfriend who always somehow seems to\nhave everything planned out, or talk\nto your personal/academic tutor.\nTake Breaks\nHave you taken a break? Some time\nbetween problem sheets to just relax\nnot only helps you unwind, but is\nalso proven to help you be more\nefficient overall. I know you have a\ndeadline, but taking a few minutes to\njust stretch your legs and take a few\ndeep breaths won't make you fail that\ncoursework.\nTake your medication\nThis is the one I always struggle with,\nI know it sucks balls to have to take\nmedication, but they were prescribed\nfor a reason, and making sure to\ntake them in their required dosage is\n\"There is\nnot a day\nwhich I do\nnot regret\nabusing\nlaxatives\nand diet\npills [...]\"\n\"Laxative\nand diet\npill abuse\nis a serious\nissue and\ncan cause\nlifelong\nhealth\nproblems \"\nLaxatives pills are becoming increasingly abused as an attempt to lose weight. Photo Credit:\nTom Varco\nWriting this article was\na challenge for me: the\ndiscussion of weight loss\nmethods can be difficult for both\nreader and writer. However, with the\ntopic of laxative abuse sweeping my\nnewsfeed I felt it only appropriate\nto share my own experiences. Last\nweek saw calls for tighter regulation\nof laxative sales, with 14 year old\nwatchdog actors buying up to 60\nlaxatives at once in supermarkets and\nchemists despite the prohibition of\nlaxative purchase under the age of 16.\nI have battled with an eating\ndisorder for almost eleven years.\nThroughout those years my eating\ndisorder, like my body, has changed\nin shape and form. At times of\ndesperation, despite knowing the\nfutility of laxative abuse, I have\nturned to laxatives and diet pills.\nThroughout my teens I successfully\npurchased laxatives and diet pills\nfrom a cross section of shops\nincluding Superdrug and Morrisons.\nIn my university years I have\npurchased and abused diet pills and\nlaxatives from an array of shops.\nMost notably, I was able to purchase\ntablets, from Boots, to prevent the\nabsorption of fat. These tablets are\nincredibly dangerous and should\nonly be used by obese patients\nunder supervision of a physician,\nnonetheless, I was able to purchase\nthem on a self service check out\nwithout question. The leaflet inside\nmerely advises against the use of\ndiet pills for those of a BMI below\n18.5 - the minimum weight to height\nrequirement to be \u2018healthy.\u2019 I find it\noutrageous that products like these\nare so readily available particularly\nwhen super-strength throat lozenges\nare kept behind the counter.\nCountless numbers of people abuse\nlaxatives and diet pills regardless of\nage and gender, many of whom suffer\nfrom an eating disorders, others\nwho succumb to societal pressures.\nLaxative and diet pill abuse is a\nserious issue and can cause lifelong\nhealth problems and even death. The\nabuse of laxatives can cause major\nelectrolyte imbalances and does not\nactually cause weight loss. Many\ndiet pills have serious and unknown\nside effects. Personally, I suffer from\nmany digestive problems due to\nabuse of laxatives and diet pills in\nconjunction with other behaviours.\nThere is not a day which I do not\nregret abusing laxatives and diet\npills despite using them relatively\ninfrequently.\nI firmly believe it is time to\nimplement more stringent\nregulations on the sales of diet pills\nand laxatives in order to tackle the\ngrowing problem of their abuse,\nparticularly amongst youths.\nRaising the price, introducing a\nmaximum number of tablets per\nsale and implementing current\nage restrictions would reduce the\naccessibility and thereforew the\nprevalence of laxative and diet\npill abuse. It\u2019s time for a change as\nultimately laxative and diet pill abuse\nis a form of drug abuse with grave\nconsequences.\nIf you are concerned about your own\nmental health,or that of a loved one,\nthere are people out there you can\ntalk to who can give you advice,or will\nbe there to listen.\nHelplines\nIf you are distressed and need\nsomeone to talk to :\nSamaritans (24 hr helpline):\nPhone: 08457 90 90 90\nWebsite: www.samaritans.org.uk\nAnxiety Help :\nAnxiety UK\nPhone: 08444 775 774\n(Mon-Fri 9:30-17:30)\nWebsite: www.anxietyuk.org.uk\nNo Panic\nPhone: 0808 800 2222\n(daily,10am-10pm)\nWebsite: www.nopanic.org.uk\nEating Disorders:\nBeat\nPhone: 0845 634 1414\n(Mon-Thurs,1.30pm-4:30pm)\nAddiction:\nAlcoholics Anonymous\nPhone: 0845 769 7555\n(24 hour helpline)\nWebsite:www.alcoholics-anonymous.\norg.uk\nNarcotics Anonymous\nPhone: 0300 999 1212\nWebsite: www.ukna.org\nCollege Resources\nStudent Counselling Service\nPhone: 020 7594 9637\ne-mail: counselling@ic.ac.uk\nImperial College Health Centre\nTelephone: 020 7584 6301\ne-mail: healthcentre@ic.ac.uk\nYou can also go to your academic or\npersonal tutor regarding pastoral\nissues,especially if you think your\nmental health might be affecting\nyour academic performance.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nSo I know for most of you, term\nhas started to pick up, and\nsometimes, in between various\ncoursework deadlines, problem\nsheets, and even socialising, it might\nbe difficult to remember to take care\nof yourself.

During\nthe evening, founders Sanya Patel\nand Sophia Lewis set out their aims\nfor the group.\n\u201cEmpower is a support network\naimed towards women\u201d, says Ms Patel,\n\u201cWe have three aims: to improve self\nconfidence and well-being by having\na positive environment where people\ncan set out goals and achieve them;\n[the teaching of] professional skills;\nand charity\u201d.\nWhile charity work may seem\nincongruous compared to the\nempowerment of women, the\nfounders see it as integral to their\nmission: \u201cthrough charity you can\nbe encouraged to learn skills such as\ntime planning, organisation, budget\nmanagement and leadership; and\nraise money for charity, helping\nsupport women in less fortunate\npositions.\u201d\nThe idea for Empower came about\n\u201cover falafel\u201d; Ms Patel and Ms\nLewis both describe themselves as\n\u201cambitious women\u201d, however, Ms\nLewis noted that \u201ca lot of things we\nwere being told in hospital [both\nwomen are medical students] went\nagainst this\u2026the idea that girls can\u2019t\nbe academic\u201d.\nSo do they feel that things are\ndifferent for women in STEM\n(Science, Engineering, Technology,\nMathematics) subjects compared\nto those in other disciplines? \u201cOf\ncourse!\u201d says Ms Lewis, \u2018Oh you\u2019re a\ngirl, you\u2019re no good at maths; you\u2019re\na girl, you\u2019re no good at physics;\nyou\u2019re a girl, why do you want to do\nengineering? Why do you want to be a\nsurgeon, or\u2026\u2019 People will tell you this\nyour whole life.\u201d Ms Patel agrees; \u201c we\nare so lucky in the UK to be given a\nlot as women, but there still remains a\nbaseline attitude of inequality.\u201d\nWithin the group, which was made\nup of people from a variety of years\nand subjects, the focus seemed mainly\nto be on personal goals related to self-confidence, as opposed to overarching\naims relating to campaigning within\nsociety. While some people have been\nEmpower: the new feminist society to\nhit Imperial?\nFred Fyles attends the first Empower mingle of the year to find out\ncritical of the group, questioning its\nnecessity when Imperial Feminist\nSociety was founded three years ago,\nboth Empower and FemSoc agree that\ntheir groups have different goals.\nWhen asked for a statement,\na representative of FemSoc said\n\u201cI think that the roles of the two\nsocieties are different; we\u2019re more\nabout political discussion and\nactivism, whereas they\u2019re more about\nnetworking and professional skills.\nHowever, there is plenty of room,\nand we are more than happy for the\ntwo societies to coexist and work\ntogether.\u201d\nEmpower is similarly friendly\ntowards FemSoc, and are open to\ncollaborating with them in the future.\n\u201cEmpower is about collaboration,\nabout working together to achieve\ngoals, and it doesn\u2019t matter whose\nidea it is, or who\u2019s organising what,\nthe point is addressing gender\ninequality and imbalance,\u201d says Ms\nPatel. \u201cWe both want to achieve that,\nand it doesn\u2019t matter how it comes\nabout.\u201d\nProfessor Alice Gast, who is the\nsixteenth head of Imperial College\nand the first woman to be appointed\nto the role, has expressed support for\nthe group. As well as taking time out\nof her schedule to attend the meeting,\nshe said \u201cI think it\u2019s terrific to have\ninterdisciplinary collaboration,\nwhere students from different years\ncan come together to support one\nanother, share ideas, and become\nmentors.\u201d\nProfessor Gast was particularly\nenthusiastic about the mentoring\nscheme, which aims to provide\nwomen students with support from\nolder years, saying \u201cI think that [in\nterms of mentoring] more senior\nstudents benefit from it as much as\nthe younger students do.\u201d During\nher speech, she mentioned her\nexperiences in being both a mentor\nand a mentee, and commended the\nvaluable contribution it provided to\nher academic life.\nHowever, not everyone has been\nso sold on the idea of Empower. In\nterms of criticism, the overwhelming\ncomplaint has been that people don\u2019t\nknow what the group aims to do;\nwith such a large range of goals, some\npeople feel that Empower may lack a\nsingle focus.\nFurther controversy came in the\nform of the promotional video they\nposted on Facebook over the summer\nthat featured the girls in bikinis.\nSanya and Sophie were both aware of\nthis criticism, with Ms Patel saying\nthat those who were complaining\nseemed to think that \u201ca woman can\u2019t\nbe ambitious and intelligent, and\nwear a bikini at the same time\u201d.\nThe group is also yet to have been\ngranted official society status, as their\napplication to the New Activities\nCommittee hasn\u2019t gone smoothly.\nTheir application wasn\u2019t accepted\nin its initial form, and Empower\nwill be meeting with the committee\nto re-evaluate their application in\nNovember before reapplying.\nThe women behind Empower still\nremain optimistic, both for their\ngroup, and for the future of women at\nImperial. \u201cEverything is possible\u201d, says\nMs Patel, \u201cand when you have a team,\na committee, a society around you, all\nwilling you to do well and to achieve,\nthere is no reason why you can\u2019t!\u201d\nProfessor Alice Gast talks to the members of Empower.

    "content": "26 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n24.10.2014\nArts Editor Fred Fyles & Kamil McClelland\nArts\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAn Imperfect Reflection Of Our Modern Society\nTo say that J. G. Ballard was\nonly a writer is to do him a\ndisservice. The late British\nmodernist, whose oeuvre included\nnovels, essays, and short fiction, was\nmore of a prophet than an author:\nseemingly predicting the brutal\nmodernisation that would descend\nupon the UK during the second half\nof the 20th Century, as well as the\naccompanying social stagnation it\nwould bring. Ballard has the honor\nof having his name as an adjective:\nBallardian, which Collins English\nDictionary describes as \u201cdystopian\nmodernity, bleak man-made\nlandscapes, and the psychological\neffects of technological progress\u201d.\nYou could easily be forgiven if\nyou think this sounds familiar.\nWith the advent of social media,\nonline communication, and mass\nmedia, society has moved into\nan unprecedented age: post-post-modern and more futuristic than\nthe future, the world we now inhabit\nhas been cleft in half: we have\nthe \u2018true reality\u2019, and the virtual\n\u2018mirrorworld\u2019. At least, this is what\nthe Hayward Gallery hopes to\nprove with the opening of its latest\nexhibition MIRRORCITY. Taking\non innumerable big themes \u2013 reality,\nnarrative, physical spaces, illusions,\nsocial mobility, capitalism, and more\n\u2013 MIRRORCITY is an exhibition\nthat aims high, but never quite\ndelivers such lofty heights, creating\nan experience that is beguiling,\nsometimes uplifting, but ultimately\nfrustrating.\nUpon entering the bleak cement\nexhibition space, we are confronted\nwith the vast upturned hull of a ship.\nIts figurehead lies, pathetic, on the\nfloor: a young woman whose face is\nshrouded, entangled in the arms of\na sea monster. This is the work of\nLindsay Seers, whose installation\nconfronts the disconnect between\nmyth and reality. Drawing on the\npersonal story of her great-great-uncle \u2013 a sailor \u2013 Seers uses film and\nsound to subtly make the viewer\nquestion the world around them.\nThis theme of artifice is further\nexpounded upon by Turner Prize\nwinner Laure Prouvost, whose\nwork The Artist comprises of a prearranged \u2018studio\u2019, purportedly that\nof her conceptual artist grandfather.\nSqueezing into this cramped space\nunder the beady eye of a security\nguard, one is immediately assaulted,\nboth visually and audibly: every nook\nand cranny of the room is filled up\nwith clutter, tools, and ephemera,\nthrough which Provost reconstructs\nthe legend of her grandfather. Video\ninstallations play throughout the\nroom, while looped soundtracks filter\nin and out of the space. Urging you\nto \u2018Look here!\u2019 and \u2018Look over there!\u2019,\nthey combine to create an unsettling\nexperience.\nAnother narrative is constructed\nby Ursula Mayer: taking inspiration\nfrom Euripides\u2019 Greek tragedy Medea,\nshe casts LGBT activist JD Samson\nas both Medea and Jason, creating a\n\u2018post-gender speculation\u2019. A vision\nof a future where social structures\nhave been broken down, it is at once\nboth inspiring and dystopian. Set\npredominantly among valleys and\ndeserts, the collage of text, sound,\nand film is like a Middle Eastern\nversion of Derek Jarman\u2019s The Last of\nEngland.\nElsewhere, artists explore the\nmeaning of different media and\nmaterials. John Stezaker\u2019s work\nis excellent as usual, with his\nrepurposed film stills, clipped and\nTim Etchells, Vacuum Days (Posters), MIRRORCITY at Hayward Gallery 2014 Photo: Courtesy\nof the Artist\nFred Fyles takes a glance at the new MIRRORCITY exhibition\n\"The\nexhibtion is\nbeguiling,\nuplifting,\nbut\nultimately\nfrustrating\"\n\"John\nStezaker's\nwork is\nexcellent,\ncreating a\nnew visual\nlanguage\"\npasted together, creating a new\nvisual language. Less effective are\nDaniel Sinsel\u2019s canvases: aiming to\ndeconstruct the relationship between\nmaterials and the feelings they evoke,\nSinsel uses extreme juxtaposition\nto bring out their qualities, but\nultimately lacks emotional force.\nHelen Marten attempts to do\nsomething similar with her rag-tag\ncollection of curios, assembled as\nif by a magpie. Sadly, randomly\nthrowing together disparate objects\ndoes not effective art make \u2013 perhaps\nshe should leave it to the actual birds.\nThe promised exploration of\ncapitalism is fulfilled by Tim\nEtchells; his fantasy headlines,\nprinted on large sheets, satirise the\nnews of today. Dryer than a gin\nmartini, and packing twice the punch,\nthey take on all manner of topics,\nfrom CCTV to gang culture (Sample\nheadline: Tonight\u2019s Presentation: Black\nHole \u2013 No Intermission). In terms\nof understanding modern culture,\nEtchells is way above any other\nartists in the exhibition; if Private\nEye is looking for a new contributor,\nperhaps they should give him a call.\nPil & Galia Kollektiv continue\nin this vein, with their sculpture\nConcrete Gown for Immaterial Flows\ntaking its name from a Zionist paean\nto cement. Inspired by capitalism, it\nis a stage constructed out of concrete\nblocks which form bar graphs and\npie charts, while behind a red arrow\ncrashes towards the earth. The\nwork subverts the argument that\ncapitalism is a natural extension\nof evolution, instead revealing it\nas something artificial, manmade,\nand callous. While the work is quite\nclever, some of the points the artists\nare trying to make can at times feel\nlike a bit of a stretch \u2013 you\u2019re more\nlikely to see this piece on Top of the\nPops than at an Occupy rally.\nA highlight of the exhibition is\nKatrina Palmer, whose emotive\nsoundscape Reality Flickers is\nhoused in an empty locker, a space\nthat \u201ccontains nothing but its own\nabsence\u201d. A voiceover that describes\nthe story of Miss Ficker, a naive\ncollector of tossed objects, defined by\nthe fact that they are \u2018lost rather than\nfound\u2019, who meets the Heart Beast.\nUnderscored by a subtle, melancholic\npiano score & unintelligible voices\nwhich mutter and stutter, Palmer\nhas created an oasis of solitude and\nisolation within the middle of the\ngallery.\nThe remainder of the exhibition\n\u2013 and trust me, it is extensive \u2013 is by\nand large uninspiring. There\u2019s Anne\nMardy, whose constructed spaces\nare as bland as the cement blocks\ninhabiting them; Michael Dean\u2019s\nsculptures, which are dull both in\nform and name; and Mohammed\nQasim Ashfaq, whose work\nsimultaneously demands \u2018viewer\nengagement\u2019 (his words, not mine)\nand manages to be monumentally\ninsipid. Some work comes from a\nclear germ of inspiration, such as\nSusan Hiller\u2019s collage of space sounds\nand frequencies, but ultimately fails\nto say anything of importance.\nWe have seen in the past few years\nthat the Hayward Gallery is able to\nput on first class exhibitions which\ntake on a wide range of themes.\nHowever, MIRRORCITY is a step too\nfar; by trying to cover all the bases\nit stretches itself too thin, until you\ncan see through the veneer of the\nmajority of the works to find the\nunimaginative premise underneath.\nLike many visions of the future, it\npromises wealth and riches, but at\nbest delivers malaise and ennui; in\nthat respect, at least, Ballard would\nbe proud.\n14th\nOct 2014 to 4th\nJan 2015\nHayward Gallery\nStudent tickets from \u00a38\nJohn Steazker, Double Shadow V (cropped), MIRRORCITY at Hayward Gallery Photo: Courtesy\nof the artist\n\n"

Things kicked off at midday\nand carried on late into the evening,\nwith matches taking place throughout\nthe day.\nImperial College London staff,\nsome of the officer trustees and\nsenior medical staff from Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine were in\nattendance, with many bringing their\nchildren and pets. Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies), Abi de Bruin,\nsaid that the atmosphere was very\npleasant. \u201cIt was very much a family\nday \u2013 it was a great vibe.\u201d\nSports games took place over the\nday, including lacrosse, netball, and\nthe men\u2019s and women\u2019s rugby teams\nplaying. The Imperial Medics team,\nthe Legends, played against a team\nof alumni players. The Legends,\ncaptained by the ICSMSU President\nDariush Hassanzadeh-Baboli, beat\nthe doctors by around 20 points.\nAbout 400 people were thought to\nhave attended the event in total.\nThe event represented a final send-off for the grounds, which have been\nused by the medical students since\n1935. Lord Beaverbrook, a consultant,\nbought the land in 1935 and gave it\nto St Marys Hospital Medical School,\nwhich went on to form Imperial\nCollege of Medicine in 1997.\nDespite initial protests to save the\nTeddington grounds and ensure their\ncontinued use after Imperial College\npurchased Heston, this was the last\ntime medics will be playing on the\ngrounds.\nDariush said of the event: \u201cIt\nwas very sad to say goodbye to\nTeddington, but the day was a success\nand we would love to replicate it on\nan annual basis, with many older\nstudents and retired doctors in\nattendance.\n\u201cIt was well received and enjoyed by\nall. There was great food and a great\nsocial atmosphere.\nI would like to thank Charlotte\nDuggan, Leena Barret and the\nsabbatical officers for helping to\norganise it.\u201d\nFrom this point on, medics will be\nplaying matches at Heston, half an\nhour\u2019s drive away from Teddington.\nHeston, home of the BA Members\nclub, is close to Heathrow airport and\nfeatures both indoor and outdoor\nfacilities for student use.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nHundreds of graduate students\nwere looking forward to\nenjoying one last hurrah\ntreading the sticky floors of Metric\nonly for their revelry to be cut short\nby fire alarms and the early closing of\nthe bars.\nFor the second time in two weeks\nthe fire alarm forced people to leave\nthe Union buildings. Stepping up\ntheir game this week, the serial\nanarchist triggered several alarm\npoints causing security to take over\n40 minutes to deal with the alarms.\nWhen the alarm initially sounded,\nthe Union Bar was four people deep,\nand nobody moved. Such was the\ndesperation to quench their thirst\npeople were risking being burnt alive\nto get their drinks. Only when the\nlights got turned up and people were\nthreatened with being kicked out\ndid people eventually begin to move\noutside.\nThe bar staff dealt with the angry\ncrowds by issuing paper slips with\nnumbers written on them to try and\npreserve the queue at the bar; it is\nunknown how successful this was.\nOnce outside, scores of people\nimmediately left for Eastside, and\nthose that remained tried to keep\nwarm by singing songs. As tensions\nrose between several sports clubs,\nglasses were broken and it looked like\nthe whole evening had gone to the\ndogs.\nAfter a stern word from Sam the\nbouncer things quietened down, the\ndiscontent merely simmering below\nthe surface. As it was clear that there\nwas no fire, people were loathe to\nleave but nobody was being allowed\nback in until the alarm was turned\noff; this led to people urinating in the\nquad as there were no other facilities\navailable.\nWhile it\u2019s clear the staff on hand\nwere doing what they could to reopen\nthe bar as quickly as possible and that\nno members of the public could be\nallowed to enter the premesis without\na working fire alarm system, those\n40 minutes of cold are going to be\nsome peoples lasting memories of the\nUnion.\nEventually the multiple tripped\nalarms were quietened, the bar was\nrestocked and the thirsty graduands\nwere allowed back in. This sweet sense\nof relief was short lived however as\nthe bar closed at 1, the lights going up\nimmediately, unlike a standard \u2018CSP\nWednesday\u2019. Mutterings about the\nlack of a late licence were short-lived\nas patrons were encouraged to leave\nquickly, which led to the quad filling\nup fast and lots of semi-drunk people\ndesperately competing for Uber cars.\nOn the whole it was an enjoyable\nevening, even if it was punctured by\na wannabe anarchist and curtailed\nearly.\nA union spokesperson said to\nFelix: \"Unfortunately, during\nCSP Wednesday, three fire alarm\nactivation points were falsely\ntriggered by people in the venue\nwhich in-turn caused a full\nevacuation of the Union building.\nThe time it took to check the\nactivation points, isolate them\nand reset the alarm was around 40\nminutes. A similar incident occurred\nlast Wednesday night, again causing\na full evacuation. As a result of these\nincidents the Union is reviewing our\napproach to access to the building on\nbusy nights and will also be increasing\nthe amount of security staff in the\nvenue and restricting access to areas\nabove the ground floor.\nIt is a shame that the actions of a\nfew had an impact on so many people,\nhowever our first priority will always\nbe the safety of our members.\"\n\n"

Most of us have grown up on an\ninternet where all websites have been\ntreated equally, where data exchange\nis not biased towards any particular\ncompany or brand.\nHowever, in January this year\nFederal Courts in the US nullified\na ruling laid out by the Federal\nCommunications Commission (FCC)\nstating that it is illegal for internet\nservice providers (ISPs) to block\nonline traffic or offer preferential\ntreatment. The consequence of this\noverruling is that the massive ISPs\nin America (Verizon, Comcast) can\ngive wealthy websites access to \u2018fastlanes\u2019. The concept is fairly simple\n\u2013 multimillion dollar companies\npay the ISPs a fee depending on how\nquickly they want consumers to\naccess their content. The ISPs then\norganise the rate of data exchange\nbetween the website and the\nconsumer. This system is analogous\nto premium airline boarding services\nwhere people willing to spend more\nmoney can get on the aircraft faster.\nThe idea of \u2018net neutrality\u2019 is that\neveryone queues in the same line for\ninternet access with no bias towards\nrich or successful websites.\nSo what is the benefit of the fast-lane system? One argument is that\nthe revenue brought in from big\nwebsites can be invested in improving\nconsumer service; upgrading\ntechnology, supplying fast-internet\nto a wider range of people and\ngenerally improving the performance\nof the internet for everyone. This is\nmaking the large assumption that\nthe ISPs aren\u2019t just going to use the\nmoney to fill their pockets, which is\na realistic issue in the US where the\ncompetition for internet service is\nlow (or even zero in monopolised\nregions). Companies such as Comcast\nand Verizon offer poor service for\nastronomical prices, just because they\nare able to and canning net neutrality\nis not going to assist this sort of issue.\nThe main victims of this system\nare start-up companies. Many of\nthe companies, paying significant\namounts of money, would not be\nwhere they are today without net\nneutrality because in the past, the\ninternet has been a fair battlefield\nfor competition. Companies such\nas Google and Youtube became\nsuccessful because they were proven\nby the internet-visiting public\nthat they were superior to their\ncompetitors. Today, a new startup search engine or video-hosting\nwebsite would have to struggle even\nmore to gain success with the major\nplayers in the market controlling\nthe fast-lanes. People thinking of\naccessing these new budding sites\nwould be either significantly slowed\ndown or blocked completely, thss\nis the nature of the absence of net\nneutrality.\nHowever, it is likely that consumers\ncould also be negatively affected\nby this ruling. It is in the realms of\npossibility that ISPs would be able to\ncharge extra for customer access to\nwebsites that require more bandwidth\n(such as Youtube or Netflix). In high-competition areas, this could result\nin the bulk of the internet being\nbasically inaccessible.\nMany people in the US realise this\nis a realistic obstacle in the way of\ntheir ability to freely surf the web\nin the foreseeable future. The FCC\nwelcomed comments from the public\non their opinions on the abolishment\nof net neutrality and over 3.7 million\ncomments were received in total\n(smashing previous FCC record of 1.4\nmillion comments on Janet Jackson\u2019s\nSuper Bowl wardrobe malfunction\nin 2005). A study of the comments\nshowed that less than 1 percent\nof commenters were against net\nneutrality \u2013 evidence that the internet\ncommunity is not one to piss-off.\nFortunately for those in support\nof net neutrality, there is one man\nwho has been a key component in\npreventing fast-lanes in becoming\nwidespread occurrence \u2013 Barack\nObama. In fact in 2007, before his\nreign as US president began he\nstated that he and his party would be\nexplicitly against an abolishment of\nnet neutrality and said that this sort\nof system \u201cdestroys one of the best\nthings about the internet \u2013 which\nis that there is incredible equality\nthere\u201d. And perhaps unlike some\nother of his policies, he has stuck\nto his guns on this subject, stating\non the 9th\nOctober 2014, that he is\n\u201cunequivocally\u201d committed to net\nneutrality. Another major supporter\nis Tim Berners-Lee, the grandfather\nof the internet. He urged, in March\n2014, that internet users insist on\nthe development of a \u201cdigital bill of\nrights\u201d that would \u201cadvance a free and\nopen web for everyone\u201d.\nSufficient ISP competition in\nthe UK and an EU law (set in April\n2014) blocking the ISP\u2019s ability to\ncharge traffic-heavy websites for\nfaster network access means that\nthis is unlikely to affect you. But it\nis certainly worth at least thinking\nof people in the US, the richest\neconomy in the world, whose citizens\nmay have to pay over-the-odds for\nservices freely available worldwide.\nFor awareness about the trouble faced\nby millions of American citizens,\nyou may have been affected by\nthe \u201cInternet Slowdown Day\u201d that\ntook place on the 10th September\n2014. Many websites with a variety\nof renown and wealth came out in\nsupport of net neutrality and slowed\ndown access to their content and\ndisplayed a \u201cspinning wheel of death\u201d,\nshowing what a world without net\nneutrality could be like.\nThe whole situation is fairly\nsimilar to the protests against the\nStop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and\nPROTECT IP Act (PIPA) in January\n2012. Over 115,000 websites joined\nthe protest and the legislation was\nsignificantly altered in favour of the\ninternet\u2019s opinions on the matter.\n\n"

    "content": "28 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n24.10.2014\nFood\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk Editors Carol Ann Cheah and Michael Chung\nFive Guys Spice Ramen Burger\nI mean, what's not to like? Pak choi, good. Ramen, good. Meat, good! Photo: Michael Chung; pop-culture reference, Friends\nMichael Chung hacks the quirky food union\n\"Be\nwarned, it's\ndeceptively\nfilling for\none person\"\nBored of having a conventional\nburger with a bun? Well despite\nwhat our parents have told us,\nit is time for us to play with food!\nHow about a ramen burger?\nThe idea came from Keizo\nShimamoto and has been voted as one\nof \u201cThe 17 Most Influential Burgers\nof All Time\u201d by Time Magazine. He\nserves it at his restaurant, Ramen.Co,\nin New York. Thankfully you don\u2019t\nhave to travel across the pond to taste\nit; it is actually very simple to make\nit yourself at home, making this a\ngreat and easy way to convince your\nhousemates of your culinary prowess.\nIngredients\n\u2022 1 pack of instant ramen noodles\n\u2022 2 free range eggs\n\u2022 350g of beef mince (make sure\nit has at least 5%fat content to\nensure flavour and moistness)\n\u2022 2 spring onions\n\u2022 1 teaspoon five spice powder\n\u2022 a knob of ginger\n\u2022 Pak choi (or your choice of leafy\nvegetables, e.g. little gem lettuce)\nMethod\nFor the ramen buns, bring a pot of\nwater to the boil and cook noodles\naccording to the timings stated on the\npacket (anywhere between 2-5 mins).\nDrain and leave to cool slightly for a\nminute or so.\nBeat an egg and toss the noodles in.\nPut half of the noodle-egg mix in a\nmould lined with cling film. Fold the\nfilm back over the noodles and place a\nweight on top to compress into a patty\nshape. Repeat the wrapping-and-weighting process for the other \u201cbun\u201d ,\nthen put them in the fridge for 15-20\nminutes so they hold their shape.\nFor the burger patties, chop the\nspring onions and ginger finely, then\nmix it with the mince along with the\nfive spice powder. Shape the mix into\npatties \u2013 there are many ways of doing\nthis, but the easiest is to first shape\nit into a ball, then squeeze the mix\ninto something almost resembling a\nhockey puck, ensuring it is roughly\nthe same size as the \u201cbun\u201d.\nFry the patties in a frying pan with\na shot of oil for 3-4 minutes on each\nside to char and colour the outside,\nand to cook right through to the\nmiddle. Do the same for the ramen\nburger buns so that they go crispy and\ngolden on the outside.\nTo assemble, pop your patty on one\nof the ramen buns. Top the patty with\nan egg that\u2019s fried over-easy (yolk still\nrunny) and finish with pak choi to\nretain the Asian-inspired flavours.\nPop your other bun on top and tuck\nin! Be warned, it\u2019s deceptively filling\nfor one person so you might want to\nshare as a snack between two.\nFelix Food Protips\nBring it up to Level >9000 by\nsubbing the instant ramen noodles\nwith fresh noodles. In fact, it\u2019s what\ncreator Keizo Shimamoto does as\nstandard at his restaurant.\nVegetarians can swap the patty\nout for a stonkin\u2019 good portobello\nmushroom. Just fry for a few minutes\non either side and season...absolutely\njuicy and good for you.\nMike didn\u2019t use the seasoning\npacket that came with the instant\nramen, however you can add it to\nthe recipe if you like. Either chuck\nit in with the water when boiling\nramen for the buns, or add it to the\nmeat mix. Just be careful if you do\nthe latter, as you really don\u2019t want to\nover-season and make your burger\ninedible!\nOn a final note about portion sizes...\nfeel free to adjust quantities to suit\nyour appetite, or split this up into two\nsmaller snackable burgers. You might\nneed to adjust cooking times if you do\nthis. Enjoy!\nThis issue is totally\nbuggered up - I mean,\nburgered up\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nYeah,I make no apologies whatsoever for the awful\npunnery present in that editorial title...so sue me.I\nreally do have burgers on the brain this week though;\nyes,who'dve thunk that I have\u201cjunk grub\u201dmoments\nlike every other human being? It's interesting\nhow London\u2019s love affair with the tarted-up meat\nsandwich has reached crazy heights,and doesn't\nseem like it will wane anytime soon...to the point\nthat even vegetarian/vegan options have flourished\nas well,and some are pretty damn tasty.\nOn the subject of punnery...editor's personal\nshout-out of the week goes to my lovely local-delivery-recently-turned-employers,the Chosen Bun\n(chosenbun.com) homeboys in Fulham (is it apt to\ncall your bosses\u201chomeboys\u201d,pray tell?!).Some of you\nguys may have heard about their recent\u201cout-of-thisworld\u201dpseudo-space burger stunt,which recently\nmade both national and international press.I have\nit on good authority that one of the Evelyn Gardens\nhalls procured a massive delivery during one of the\nWorld Cup matches...for the curious,there's pictorial\nproof on Facebook.\nThey're both science geeks and one of them's\nactually a trained mechanical engineer,so I'm sure\nImperialites can find plenty of common ground\n(hah!) there-they did,after all,go on an exhaustive\ntaste-testing trip around America (spiritual\nhomeland of the burger,of course) before setting up\nshop.Gottta love a startup that loves their research,\nespecially if it's in the name of food.\nBut let\u2019s not detract from their main offerings:\ntheir burgers (made with a locally-supplied blend\nof Scottish beef and wagyu fat for that flavour/\nmoistness balance) are ruddy good,as are their\nAmerican-style sides-I\u2019ll happily admit that their\nMark and Cheese macaroni bites are one of the\nfastest ways to my heart (and gut,duh). And of\ncourse,the fact that they stay just as intact and\ngourmet-quality when delivered,all thanks to the\npackaging that\u2019s heaven for a trainee engineer (read:\nmoi.It's been patented!).That's before you take into\naccount the witty branding and personable charm/\nservice,especially from Andy and Pete themselves.If\nyou do say hi,tell them Carol sent you!\nAside from the\u201cvested interest\u201drecommendation\nthis week,it would also seem that some of our\ncontributors have been equally burger-inspired.\nMike (fondly known as our\u201ceditor in absentia\u201d) has\nbeen tinkering with the oft-called-bizarre Ramen\nBurger craze,and our lovely Travel Editor,Nam (no\nactual relation to me,for the curious),managed to\nhit the Broadway Market recently to sample a unique\nseafood burger.\nSheesh,writing this editorial has made me go\ninto craving overdrive,especially since lunchtime's\na-coming.As always...keep on eating,laughing,\nloving and living!\nSPAAAAAAAAAACE!

Selling five crab dishes, you\ncan opt for a luxurious soft shell crab\nburger for \u00a39.50 which comes in four\ndifferent choices of Old Bay batter for\nthe full experience.\nThe batter options are fennel,\nalmond, avocado and harissa; pickled\ncucumbers, chili, coriander and\nwasabi mayonnaise; samphire and\ntartar sauce; or pomegranate, harissa,\nred onion, coriander and red cabbage.\nThe likelihood is you will idle there\nfor a while, struggling to make one\nof the hardest decisions of your life.\nAlternatively if you are feeling too\nbroke or spoilt for choice, go for the\ngood old plain soft shell crab burger.\nMy personal favorite however is\nthe pomegranate batter burger. The\ncrunchy pomegranate seeds and red\ncabbage complemented the soft,\nbuttery crab patty which melts on\nyour tongue, with the red onion,\nharissa and coriander giving it a nice,\nspiced kick. The buns are well-toasted\nand fresh, accentuating the fillings.\nIf you cannot get enough of the\nsoft shell crabs, fear not \u2013 there are\nsmall snacks up for grabs too. There\u2019s\nthe innovatively named Admiral\nBenson offering two crabs with\ngarnish; classic crab cake with nori,\napple, white cabbage, spring onion\nslaw and saffron mayonnaise; as\n\"The buns are\nwell-toasted\nand fresh,\naccentuating\nthe fillings\"\nwell as the Crabbie Kiev, which are\nbreadcrumbed and fried white crab\nmeat balls with a heavenly center\ncontaining brown crab meat and\nmelted infused butter.\nAs a street food stall, it can be quite\nhard to catch the Crabbieshack since\nthey move around London with no\nregular spot. However, this all just\nadds to the satisfaction when you\nfinally catch up with them and bite\ninto that delicious burger.\nNam managed to catch these guys at\nKERB King\u2019s Cross for this review.

He was very\npopular amongst celebrities and\nother important figures, and his looks\nwere always feminine, elegant and\nappropriate. His long and successful\ncareer has seen him dress some of\nthe most prominent style icons in\nthe world, including Jackie Onassis,\nAudrey Hepburn, Hillary Clinton and\nSarah Jessica Parker as Carrie in \u2018Sex\nand the City.\u2019\nOscar de la Renta was part of the\nfashion establishment. When it came\nto his designs, he didn\u2019t rock the boat-but that didn\u2019t make them any less\nmemorable.\nHe was born to a wealthy family\nin Santo Domingo in 1932, and\nemigrated to the US after living\nin Madrid and Paris, working for\nhousehold names such as Cristobal\nBalenciaga, Lanvin and Balmain.\nLuckily for de la Renta, he remained\nimpeccably dressed throghout his\ntime living in Europe, as his wealthy\nfather used to send him money. His\ntrademark look was a dapper three-piece suit. It was important for his\nbuisness and reputation to be well\ndressed, as he would often entertain\nhis wealthy clients in his holiday\nhomes.\nWhilst he was well known for\nhis gowns and skirt suits which\nrepresented American high society,\nhis mainstream reputation grew\nout of Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s \u2018Carrie\nBradshaw\u2019 in the hit TV series \u2018Sex and\nCity\u2019. In the show, Carrie\u2019s Russian\nboyfriend buys her a bright pink\nOscar de la Renta dress, with a tight\ntop and a full skirt. It became a cult\ntv moment, and it cemented de la\nRenta as a household fashion name\nin popular culture. Off screen, Sarah\nJessica Parker also regulalrly wore his\ndesigns on the red carpet.\nHe was, arguably, the king of the\nred carpet. His flowing, opulent\ngowns were worn by many women\nduring the Oscars and other red\ncarpet events, with Amy Adams\nwearing a memorable grey ruffled\nvoluminous gown at the 2013 Oscars.\nMost recently, he featured heavily\nin the media for designing Amal\nAlamuddins ivory lace wedding dress\nfor her wedding to George Clooney.\nDe la Renta\u2019s big break as a designer\ncame when he dressed Beatrice\nLodge, who was the daughter of the\nAmerican Ambassador to Spain in\n1956. She featured on the cover of life\nmagazine at the time, wearing the\ngown he designed. Shortly afterwards,\nhe dressed Jackie Kennedy in the\n1960\u2019s, and in the 1990\u2019s, he began to\ndress Hillary Clinton, who credited\nher signature suited style to the\ndesigner. Hillary took to twitter and\nsaid \u201c He\u2019s been working for 20 years\nto turn me into a fashion icon.\u201d\nAs much as he was well dressed,\nwealthy and versed in socialising\nwith the elite, he was not afraid to\ncriticise and engage in an argument\nin the public eye. In 2009, he criticsed\nMichelle Obama for wearing a J.Crew\nsweater to Buckingham palace to\nmeet the Queen. Perhaps de la Renta\u2019s\ncritcisms towards the First Lady\nstemmed from her breaking the\nWhite House tradition of wearing\nthe designers pieces, as she declined\nto wear his looks for the past seven\nyears. Finally though, this month,\nshe wore an Oscar de la Renta cocktail\ndress to a party after her White\nHouse Fashion Education Workshop.\nThis was significant, because by\nappearing in one of his designs, she\nacknowledged his place as household\nname in American fashion and\nsupported him as a designer.\nBefore his death, Oscar de la Renta\nannounced earlier this month that\nhe would appoint Peter Copping as\nthe new creative director of his label.\nCopping, an English desinger, has\nworked for Nina Ricci for five years\nand is known for his elegant style,\nwhich is befitting of the fashion\nlegagcy he must live up to. His first\ncollection will be shown in February.\nNo doubt he will pay homage to de\nla Renta with glamorous red carpet\nlooks, whilst still catering to younger\nhigh society with colorful gowns and\ncleaner, structured silhouettes. Oscar\nde la Renta will be remembered for\ndressing the First Ladies of the White\nHouse, ruling the red carpet, and\nembodying the American Dream.\nSarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw.

This was the\nwork of Rachel Ann Stevenson conveying the fine divide\nbetween the conscious mind and dream state.\nThe remainder of the works were equally eccentric:\nan artist who used old wine corks to create large scale\npieces,a hilariously outr\u00e9 man who had several iPads\nplaying videos of him singing along to songs in locations\nacross the world,and a bizarre collection of modified\nstorm-trooper helmets.Not only did I leave this magical\nplace with armfuls of free stickers,posters and postcards\nto put on my wall,but I was inspired by how innovative\nthe artists were.\nThe fair did what every exhibition\u2013and every work of\nart\u2013should do: it inspired me to want to create my own\nwork and develop my own signature style just like them.\nI highly recommend catching next year\u2019s art fair,which\nunfortunately only runs for three days each year around\nOctober time.Meanwhile,I\u2019m going to carry on checking\nout new artists,and trying to find inspiration!\nLIZZIE RIACH\n2ND YEAR BIOLOGIST\n\"An\nenvironment\nmore akin\nto a cattle\nmarket\nthan an art\ngallery\"\n\"This year's\nFrieze Art\nfair had\nas much\npersonality\nas a kitchen\nshowroom\"\nWhen men die, they enter\ninto history. When statues\ndie, they enter into art.\nThis botany of death is what we call\nculture. These powerful opening\nlines from the 1953 film \u2018Les Statues\nMeurent Aussi\u2019 (\u2018Statues Also Die\u2019)originally made as a critique of the\nWest\u2019s consumerist attitude towards\nAfrican art \u2013 resonated with me as I\nwent around London\u2019s 12th annual\nFrieze Art Fair, where art exists only\nas a commodity, a soulless husk.\nI visited the fair last year and was\nquite upbeat; there was an air of youth\nand dynamism about it and you felt\nas if you might be seeing the \u2018next big\nthing\u2019. Of course, as with any fair, you\nwere aware that the art on display was\nprimarily there to be sold but you did\noccasionally forget this. It was a truly\nimmersive art experience.\nI wish I could be so positive this\nyear, but it seems that the view of art\nas a mere asset has grown too strong,\nlike some kind of parasitic mould.\nFrieze has lost its unpretentious spirit\nand is now just another of the many\nfairs around the world that exists only\nfor the super rich elite, out of touch\nand irrelevant to everyone else. This\nshould have been obvious enough by\njust looking at the ticket prices \u2013 \u00a333\nfor adults and \u00a324 for students \u2013\nsimply not worth the money!\nI am not saying that the art was of\npoor quality, as there was undeniably\nsome excellent work on display that\nwas simultaneously exciting and\nchallenging \u2013 everything you might\nwant. But it was not allowed to shine\nfor the most part, crammed into\nthe 162 galleries from 25 different\ncountries vying for your attention.\nMoreover, as you rounded gallery\nnumber 100, the inevitable art\nfatigue resulting from this sensory\nbombardment set in, making it\ndifficult to appreciate what you\nwere seeing. The Frieze has swollen\nto grotesque proportions, crammed\nfull of substance, like a bloated,\nwaterlogged corpse that has been\ndragged out of the Regent\u2019s Park\nBoating Lake. The fact is that this is\nnot how art should be viewed, in an\nenvironment more akin to a cattle\nmarket than an art gallery.\nBut I can understand why the\ngalleries act as they do. Here, they are\nin a highly competitive environment,\nand so they are naturally going\nto display their most famous and\nvaluable pieces because that is where\nthe money and reputation lies.\nHowever, with that, the essence\nof the art fair ceases to exist and\nbecomes a fa\u00e7ade, just like the\nimmaculately dressed gallery owners\nwho sit with their espressos, much\ntoo busy for anyone except the most\nserious buyers.\nThere were certainly some standout\ngalleries; Hauser & Wirth and the\nGagosian Gallery in particular had\njust the right mix of high quality\nart and interactivity to attract your\nattention and set them apart from the\ncrowd. Elsewhere, Jesus Rafael Soto\u2019s\nOp Art piece \u2018Carr\u00e9 olive et vibration\u2019\nfrom the Galerie Perrotin proved\nextremely captivating and quite\nunique in a fair overburdened with\nhighly decorative works of synthetics\nand acrylics.\nIn general, the works on display\nseemed to fall into three categories:\nthe mediocre, big money pieces\nthat galleries were putting all their\nhopes on, like Martin Creed\u2019s (I still\nhave no idea why he\u2019s famous) or\nTony Cragg\u2019s; the less well known art\nthat bulks out a gallery\u2019s portfolio,\nproviding the best and worst of what\nwas on offer; and finally the pieces\ndesigned purely for the selfie \u2013 often\nmirrored, always provocative, perfect\nto show your social media contacts\njust how artsy you are!\nThis final category is a perfect\nillustration of the superficiality\nof much that was on show. This\nyear\u2019s Frieze art fair was a sorrowful\noccasion, no longer a place where the\naverage art enthusiast can get a sense\nof the shape of art to come.\nIt had as much personality as a\nkitchen showroom: elegant and\nskillfully crafted but nothing more.\nAnd \u2018more\u2019 is exactly what art should\nbe: an experience, an emotional\ncatalyst that sticks with you for days\nafterwards.\nBut one can\u2019t deny that Frieze is\nmerely part of a bigger problem, as\nthe artistic heart of London is gutted\nout, replaced by the shallowness of\nforeign buyers and their veneration\nfor the famous.\nEditorial: An Artistic\nDrought Hits the Capital\nLondon was thrown into a feeding\nfrenzy last week,as culture vultures\nfrom around the world descended on\nthe city to feast on its artistic innards.\nYes,it was Frieze week,the (alleged)\nhighlight of London's cultural calendar!\nBut as quickly as it came,this tornado of\nchequebooks and perfectly manicured\nnails disappeared,to return again next\nyear.In our article on the fair,we reflect\non this white elephant of Regent's Park\nand its implications on London's cultural\nlandscape.\nHowever,just as we lament a lost past,\nLizzie Riach speaks with optimism in her\nMy Art piece about The Other Art Fair,\nsuggesting that there is still a vibrant\nand very much alive art scene in the East\nof the capital.As a fair aiming to exhibit\nthe 99% of artists not represented by a\ncommercial gallery,hopefully this news\nfrom out east bodes well for the health\nof the city's art scene.\nNext,we turn our pessimistic gaze\nto another of London's great art\ninstitutions: the Turner Prize.Not scared\nof a bit of controversy,we take a leaf\nout of its book and suggest it's become\nan almost irrelevant competition,\ndeliberately choosing\u2018out there\u2019works\nto force\u2018discussion\u2019about art now.It\u2019s\ntiresome.\nContinuing in this vein of misanthropy,\nwe come away from the Hayward\nGallery\u2019s MIRRORCITY exhibition with a\nfeeling of bewilderment and frustration\nas it tried to answer everything but fell\nexpectedly short.\nFinally,to end this depressing editorial\non a slightly more positive note,we went\ndown to the HELIX Centre at St.Mary\u2019s\nHospital.Part of Imperial\u2019s Institute of\nGlobal Health Innovation,they are an\namazing team of RCA-trained designers\nworking closely with doctors and\nresearchers to create design solutions\nto common healthcare problems.So\nwhether you're interested in design,\nmedicine or just great ideas,check this\ninterview out!\nFRED FYLES & KAMIL MCCLALLAND\nARTS EDITORS\n\n"

Annalise Keating is a tough,\nshark of a criminal defence attorney,\ncomparable to the great Patty Hewes\n(Glenn Close) of Damages.\nABC\u2019s new ratings hit, How to Get\nAway with Murder, made with the\nbacking of executive producer Shonda\nRhimes, who currently has three hit\nshows under her name airing on the\nsame night over in the States, benefits\ngreatly from having such a firm,\nuntouchable, ambiguous heroine\nleading the rest of the talented cast.\nMorally dubious and unpredictable\nat every turn, this new legal thriller\nof the 2014-15 season is simply an\nunmissable treat. Davis provides a\ncool, slick figure who is the definition\nof a confident career woman. She\nloves a challenge in the courtroom,\nand does not let a significant setback\nmake a dent in her case for her clients.\nEssentially, whenever Davis is on the\nscreen, very little can go wrong. She\nhas weak spots too, however, ones that\nare shown in her private moments,\nand Davis shows that she excels\nnot only in the earthy, dominating\ncourtroom scenes, but she also\nknocks it out of the park in her more\nvulnerable moments in which she\nlooks truly frightened for whatever\nreason.\nThe series has a similar format\nto Damages. Using flashforwards\nand flashbacks, we see a group of\nProfessor Keating\u2019s students trying\nto cover up a murder. Then we\nrewind to three months ago, when\nthey started in Professor Keating\u2019s\nCriminal Law 100 class. The five\nstudents assist Professor Keating\nand her two associates with their\nhigh-profile criminal cases, not all of\nthem murders, in a self-concluding,\ncriminal-case-of-the-week type of\nformat, then we get what appears to\nbe a season-long story arc that deals\nwith the disappearance, and eventual\nmurder of a college student, all the\nwhile developing the characters of the\nmain cast.\nWhat is quickly established is the\nnature and dynamic of the five main\nstudents who get the chance to work\nfor Professor Keating. Wes Gibbons\n(Alfred Enoch) was only barely\naccepted off the college waiting list,\nConnor Walsh (Jack Falahee) is a sly\nyoung man using his sexuality for\ninformation, Michaela (Aja Naomi\nKing) is an ambitious, driven woman\nwho wouldn\u2019t think twice about\nbackstabbing, Laurel Castillo (Karla\nSouza) is the quietest one but this\nby no means affects her intellectual\ncapabilities, and Asher (Matt\nMcGorry) is just as keen as everyone\nelse, but with perhaps the sharpest\nsense of humour. The chemistry the\nyoung members of the cast share is\nimpeccable; there is a fiery dynamic\namong the finely assembled group,\nand they do not hold back the rest\nof the more experienced cast one\nbit. Enough time is spent with each\nstudent every week to reveal more\nabout them to the audience, and it is\nthe gradual revelation of everyone\u2019s\ntrue nature that keeps us guessing\nabout who we should be rooting for.\nAnnalise\u2019s associates at her law\nfirm also have meaty roles to play.\nBonnie Winterbottom (Liza Weil)\nis not as nice as she first appears to\nbe, although getting the job done\nto help the case as a trustworthy\nsecond-in-command is what makes\nher valuable. Very little is known\nabout Frank Delfino (Charlie Weber)\nfor the moment, aside from the fact\nthat he likes sleeping with female\nstudents. But the way he mysteriously\nbroods and goes about his days\nhelping Annalise suggests that he\nhas a lot more going on than what\nis initially suggested. Tom Verica\nplays Annalise\u2019s husband Sam,\nwho also becomes entangled in all\nthe flashback/forward drama and\nmysteries.\nMore good news for HTGAWM (yes,\nJOHN PARK\nShonda\u2019s other\nmoney-making\nshows\nGrey'sAnatomy,now in its\neleventh season,is almost\nunrecognisable from its first\nseason now.More than half of\nthe original interns are gone now,\nresidents and attendings have\ncome and gone,but at least we\nstill have Meredith Grey (Ellen\nPompeo) working in the world's\nmost promiscuous hospital to be\nable to call the show what it is.\nMarital troubles are on the\nhorizon for Meredith and Derek\nShepherd (Patrick Dempsey),\nalso for Callie (Sara Ramirez)\nand Arizona (Jessica Capshaw),\nalthough the biggest storyline\nhere is the introduction of yet\nanother half-sister of Meredith,\nDr Maggie Pierce (Kelly\nMcCreary),whose birth parents\nare Richard Weber (James\nPickens Jr.) and Ellis Grey (Kate\nBurton),who is also Meredith's\nmother.Get ready for drama,\nalong with some thundering\nmedical emergencies and\nheartbreaking patient stories.\nScandalis crazier than ever in its\n4th season.\nOlivia Pope (Kerry Washington\n\u2013where\u2019s her Emmy?!) wanted to\nget away from it all,but it does\nnot take long before she is called\nback to help be Washington,\nD.C.\u2019s best fixer.President Grant\n(Tony Goldwyn) is still clearly not\nover her,whereas his wife Mellie\n(Bellamy Young\u2013where's her\nEmmy?!) is struggling to come\nto terms with her son's sudden\ndeath.\nEveryone in the cast beautifully\nperforms the word-heavy,speedy\ndialogue,and the amount of lies\nand deception that start piling\nup week after week is asking for\nmore and more trouble.When\nit all comes to a head,expect\nnothing but fireworks.\nthis acronym will become a thing), in\nthat unlike the majority of American\nnetwork television shows that tend\nto have 20+ episodes per season, this\nseries will only have 15. So instead\nof filler episodes of middling quality\nthat drag on until some shocking\nseries finale leaves a massive\ncliffhanger, it seems more likely that\nthere is a clearer sense of direction\nand structure to the way things are\nheaded. This is a sharp, fast-paced\nlegal thriller with lots of murder and\nlots of sex.\nDespite the many, many positives,\nit\u2019s not a perfect show. Not quite yet\nanyway. There is a lot to squeeze\nin to the 40-minute episode block,\nand because of this certain elements\nof the storytelling are sacrificed.\nShowing how each case is solved\ntakes the biggest hit, as very often\nloose ends are tied up in the most\nridiculous fashion, court proceedings,\nconfessions and investigations\nhappen within seconds, and the\nsuperhero group of lawyers and\nstudents assembled are capable of\ndoing quite literally anything that\nhelps them win a case. Some narrative\ntension is undoubtedly lost as there\nare very few difficulties that need\novercoming.\nBut it is a new show with plenty of\npotential. The season-long story arc\nis setting up the show to be highly\naddictive.\nPhoto: deadline\nPhoto: blackamericaweb\nPhoto: tvafterdark\nPhoto: tvfanatic\n\n"

However, this\ncapital would be significantly\ndifferent without the works of\nModernist Antoni Gaud\u00ed \u2013 the man\nwho gave creativity a whole new\ndefinition. Gaud\u00ed contributed seven\nexceptionally beautiful buildings to\nthe Spanish architectural history. You\nmust be wondering, out of seven, why\ndid I choose Casa Batll\u00f3?\nCasa Batll\u00f3 was previously an\nordinary piece of property before it\nwas bought by textile businessman\nJosep Batll\u00f3. It was then remodeled\nand redesigned by Gaud\u00ed between\n1904 and 1906 and to this date, still\nreflects the existence of imaginative\narchitecture. It stands out due to the\ninnovation of concepts employed and\nthe methodology used. The building\nconsists of a ground floor, a main\nfloor with a courtyard, four further\nself-contained floors, a loft and a\nrooftop terrace. Once you enter the\nbuilding, be ready to be blown away as\nyou\u2019ll be greeted by a grand wooden\nstaircase, which leads to the Noble\nFloor, where the Batll\u00f3 family used to\ncall home.\nAs one slowly walks up, they\u2019ll\nbe instantly entranced by the\ndifferent hues of blue coupled with\nskylights shaped like tortoise shells,\ntransporting you to the underwater\nnature reminiscent of Finding\nNemo. Gaud\u00ed stood true to his word,\nengaging the close relationship\nbetween colours and light. As a\nresult, the building well was created.\nIt was the most crucial part of the\nrefurbishment as it allows light to\nenter. To complement this idea, the\ninterior walls are covered in varying\nshades of blue, arranged from a\ndarker hue at the top grading to\nlighter at the bottom. The windows\nget progressively bigger as you\nmove from the top to the bottom\nof the house. This further testified\nGaud\u00ed\u2019s ingenuity by incorporating\nnatural light in his work. Wooden\nslits are added below the windows to\nmaximize the functionality of the\nhouse by ensuring good ventilation.\nThe roof resembles a dragon\u2019s\nback and is decorated with four\nchimneystacks. The chimneys are\ncarefully designed with caps to\nprevent the obstruction of smoke\nescape by the wind. As one moves\nthrough the house, they would be\nconstantly surprised by the tiniest\nelements displayed. The abundance\nof creativity is shown from the\ndifferent colours of tiles used.\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time at\nCasa Batll\u00f3 because for someone who\nisn\u2019t too crazy about art, it is pleasant\nto look at, intriguing enough to muse\non after, and the best of all, nothing\nshort of a remarkable experience that\ncatches one off guard at every turn.\nFor \u20ac20, you get an unforgettable\ntour around the house at your own\npace. The ticket price is also inclusive\nof an audio guide, which describes\nin most languages the perfection in\nevery detail. There is always a huge\ncrowd of tourists on most days; one\nshould thus book their tickets online\nto avoid disappointment. From a\nstudent\u2019s perspective, admission\ntickets can slightly be on the high\nside, however I can assure you it is\nworth every single penny.\nCasa Batll\u00f3, a unique residence so\nlaboriously designed and executed\nthat it left me in awe for the rest of\nmy trip.\nHaving spent a month in\nZakynthos as a volunteer, I\nhad come to the conclusion\nthat the best way to navigate and\nenjoy this wonderful Greek island is\nby renting a car and sailing along its\ncoasts. While I only travelled across\na small part of the island, here are\ntwo highlights that I would highly\nrecommend both driving and sailing\nthrough.\nShipwreck Bay\nWhilst the mystical, almost milky\nturquoise water alone provides\nenough incentive to visit this\nsea-access only beach, the wreck of\nPanagiotis washed ashore during\n1983 has made it one of the most\nfamous and photographed locations\nin the world.\nThe iconic views of this cove are\nfrom the headline accessible by roads,\nthough the sign to it is obscurely\nwritten on the ground before a sharp\nU-turn.

Mixed in\nwith this, the Royal School of Mines\ncommittee had carefully planned\ntheir start of term activities leading\nup to the big one: Fresher\u2019s Dinner.\nOn 17th\nOctober, 178 people\nattended the annual dinner at The\nRembrandt Hotel, 91 of them freshers\nfrom the Materials and Earth Science\ndepartments; this reflects the high\ndemand for the social events that the\nRSM provides for its members.\nAll the first years, accompanied\nby their older undergraduate hosts,\nmarched along Exhibition Road\nlooking rather dapper and not too\nout of place out and about in South\nKensington. Upon arrival at The\nRembrandt they were greeted by an\narray of black and gold decorations,\nand empty helium tanks that\ndefinitely weren\u2019t inhaled by VicePresident James Cox. President Ben\nWarnick started proceedings with\nan impressive welcoming speech,\nincluding a hysterical poem read\nfrom the \u201cRSM Bible\u201d.\nThe three course meal went down a\ntreat with everyone, a different league\nfrom those student budget meals your\nuni friends cook and upload pictures\nof onto Facebook in the hope of a few\n\u201clikes\u201d. No, this was a formal three\ncourse dinner from a five star hotel in\nKensington, food we at the RSM like\nto savour for our big events: chicken\nliver p\u00e2t\u00e9 with compote, cod fillet\nwith creamy chive sauce, ratatouille\nand potato rosti cake to name a few.\nAlso in attendance were two guest\nspeakers: Dr Martyn McLachlan from\nMaterials and Dr Matt Genge from\nthe Earth Science department. Both\nare popular lecturers among students\nin their respective departments,\nand quickly became the centre of\nattention with eye-catching and\nfunny speeches to the audience.\nOne highlight of the evening\nincluded third year geologist\nMatt Irwin, who took centre stage,\ndeclaring that his table would like to\nraise a toast to the President and his\ncommittee for organising the event.\nThen all five hosts and five freshers at\nthe table stood up, and literally \u201craised\na toast\u201d by holding aloft slices of toast\nto the committee table. Their pockets\nmay have been filled with burnt\ncrumbs, but the gag was successfully\npulled off. Well played, boys.\nAfter the closing speeches \u2013 as is\nstandard \u2013 the Scottish contingent of\nRSM spontaneously burst into song\nas \u201cFlower Of Scotland\u201d rang through\nthe room. This was not planned, and\nwas not prompted for any reason,\nbut it did not stop Dr McLachlan\nRSM Dinner caps off a successful\nfortnight\nMatthew Pike talks about what the Miners got up to last Friday\njoining in and taking lead.

The\nstudents in question, two girls, had\npreviously been to the Royal School\nof Mines (RSM) Freshers\u2019 dinner,\nalthough the reasons the ambulances\nwere called were unrelated to alcohol\nconsumption.\nThe ambulances arrived shortly\nafter midnight. The first came to\ncollect a student who had passed\nout due to a pre-existing medical\ncondition, whilst the other took a\nstudent who had sliced open her foot.\nBoth students have subsequently\nmade a full recovery.\nThe dinner was held at The\nRembrandt Hotel in Kensington, and\nwas attended by 178 people, around\nhalf of whom were first year students.\nIn previous years, the dinner has been\nheld in Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms, and\ntraditionally people move on to the\nUnion for after dinner drinks.\nWe spoke to Ben Warnick, RSM\nPresident for 2014/15, who was also\npresent at the dinner. \u201cAfter the end\nof the official RSMU Freshers\u2019 dinner\non Friday some people chose to go\nback to the union due to its proximity\nto the hotel. All were sufficiently\nsober to be let in by the bouncers. All\nof the appropriate welfare measures\nwere taken to ensure the wellbeing of\nthe people involved.\u201d\nDeputy President (Welfare), Chris\nKaye, was also present that evening.\nSaid Chris, \u201cI arrived at the Union just\nbefore midnight and an ambulance\nwas pulling up outside. A student had\ncollapsed with what I believe to be an\nunderlying medical condition.\n\u201cShortly afterwards, another\nambulance turned up for someone\nwho had fallen and injured\nthemselves.

While\nthe exact causes of death are not yet\nknown, rumours from the Union\nBuilding are suggesting a freak\naccident involving a pewter tankard,\na minibus instruction manual and\nDeputy President (Betrayal), Khris\nCaye, who he was due to meet that day\nfor a casino trip.\nDr. Power was born in 1880 in\nEngland, British Empire. A keen\nscientist, he secured a role at the\nRoyal College of Science, studying\nMathematics under Fermat and\nPythagoras, for which he got a first\nclass degree. However the general\ndebauchery of the Royal School\nof Mines attracted him to shift\nallegiance and complete a PhD in\n1911, as well as becoming a popular\nfixture at the annual RSM Dinner.\nDuring his PhD, he met author H.\nG. Wells, and the two of them went\non to found Imperial College Union,\nwhere Phil has been working for the\nlast 100 years.\nThere are rumours that Phil\ninvented the minibus, although\nthese are exaggerated. What is true,\nhowever, is how he introduced\nthe minibus to Imperial \u2013 a sight\non campus now just as famous as\npenicillin, Queen\u2019s Tower, and\nthe RCSU Sex Sofas. Phil would\nmeticulously care for each and\nevery minibus under his ownership\nas if they were his own children:\nchecking oil levels, washer fluid and\nseat bounciness every evening over\na glass of port. Phil confided to Felix\nlast month that he planned to set up\nMinibus Etiquette lessons, which\nwere stalled pending the delivery of\nsuitable port to the Union Bar.\nAnother notable fact about Phil\nwas his title of Tankard Baron, an\nhonorific title bestowed upon him in\n1908 by King George.\nWhilst Phil never took up his\nseat in the House of Lords, he did\nmake sure to keep all of the Union\u2019s\ntankards in tip-top condition\nin case the monarch was ever to\ncome and inspect them. Much do\nthe disappointment of DP(B), no\nmonarch is yet to visit even if he does\nhave a giant 50 inch portrait of the\nQueen.\nThere are many other fun stories to\nshare about Dr. Power, ranging from\nFirst year votes for \u201crecognisable\nclassmate\u201d in elections\nEastside pints cheaper\nper mole of alcohol\nOHBITCHUARY: Power on my friend, Power on\nHangman reckons going to any\nWetherspoons is preferable, where the\nconversation with the local clientele\nis excellent.

We really should\nget podcasts of lectures out.\u201d\nWhen asked if he was doing this to\nfill up his CV, he denied it, although\ndid at a later date admit he thought\nthere were no job opportunities for\nbiologists anymore.\nHe went on to say that if he lost,\nhe could potentially fill more lines\non his CV as a redundant Academic\nAffairs Officer.\nSaid his opponent, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t\ngive a shit, but I heard all of the\ncollege meetings come with free\nsandwiches.\u201d\nhot work permits to how he invented\neActivities in a dungeon below the\nWest Basement on a dark and stormy\nnight. However, one person who can\ndescribe the man better than anyone\nelse is Mr. Caye.

Famed for\nthe Laganas clubbing stripe, iconic\nshipwreck of Navagio beach and the\nsightings of Loggerhead sea turtles, it\nhas been a hotspot for youngsters all\nover UK as well as divers and beach\nlovers. However, most holiday seekers\nflocking to this lost paradise rarely\ntake a moment to consider their\nimpact on the endangered turtles.\nZakynthos has been the main\nnesting ground for the Mediterranean\nCaretta Caretta species of sea turtles\nfor thousands of years. Mating in the\nopen ocean, the females then travel\nup to thousands of miles throughout\nthe months of June and August to\nthe beach where they hatched to take\ntheir turn to nest.\nLaganas town of Zakynthos is the\nfamous beach and party destination,\nwith rolling sand dunes stretching\non for hundreds of meters attracting\nthousands in the 80s. Now, however\nit is completely gone and in its place\nstands countless bars and pubs\nleaving only a measly few meters\nof compacted sand, effectively\ndestroying the breeding ground.\nThe same is happening all over West\nLaganas Bay as more and more\ntourists flock to the gorgeous beaches,\nrendering only 6 of the 11.5km\nstretch of beach usable for nesting.\nThe aftermath of this is reflected\nin the dramatic drop of female\nloggerheads returning to Zakynthos\nto nest every year, and tourism\naffects even those that still return.\nBusiness such as turtle sighting\nboat trips and night time beach\ntours advertising for sightings of the\nendangered species have sprouted\nacross touristic towns taking full\nadvantage of the visiting bloom.\n\u201cWhy is this bad?\u201d you might ask;\nglass bottom boat tours are amongst\nthe most notorious in their ruthless\nbehavior to sea turtles. Boasting\na guarantee of a turtle sighting or\nyour money back, these companies\nwork in groups to locate and corner\nloggerhead females in the bay. Often\nthey use propellers to stir up the\nsand forcing them to swim to the\nsurface for the amusement of tourists\nexhausting them. Then they will try\nto get the turtles under the boat for\nphotographic views through the glass\nbottom. There has been cases where\nturtles are injured and left for death\nafter the boat has run it over. And\nthis is not the end of the story: boats\nwill come and go in turns to ship\nthe next batch of tourists to make\nthe most of it, caring little for the\nstressed creature being chased and\ncornered for what can last for hours.\nAs for night time tours, they try\nto take advantage of the early hours\nwhen females would emerge from\nthe sea and using their flappers, they\ncrawl slowly and strenuously to the\ndry sand to nest. This is an extremely\ndifficult journey for a marine species\nand any disturbance can easily scare\nthe creature into returning into\nthe sea as often occurs with tourists\noohing and awing over them. If\nstressed enough, the turtles will lay\nthe egg in the ocean where they have\nno chance of survival.\nEven if the female successfully\nnests, the odds are still stacked\nagainst the eggs. With lazy sun\nloungers, swaying palm leave\numbrellas, bars and even tractors\ninvading beaches across the island\ncompacting nests, suffocating or\nbarring the exit and often destroying\nthe eggs altogether. Even if the\nhatchlings make it out after 60 days,\nlight and noise pollution from the\nbars and pubs will disorient them and\nmany have ended up in the road and\nhave been hit by traffic.\nThere are plenty of beautiful\nbeaches apart from those in Laganas\nBay on the Island and I would\nstrongly urge you to avoid all nesting\nbeaches in an effort to conserve the\nLoggerhead. However, if you are\ndetermined to visit one, here\u2019s a few\ntips on how to be sea turtle friendly\ntourists when you visit from May to\nOctober.\nStay within 5 metres of the\nwaterline and do not venture into\nsofter sands where turtles lay their\neggs.\nNests are usually fenced off, make\nsure you stay clear of it by at least two\nmeters\nStick to the opening time of the\nbeach, which is usually 7am-6pm\nDO NOT under any condition\nreturn at night to see the female\nnesting or hatchlings, as this will only\ndisturb them\nIf you do see a turtle when\nsnorkeling, make sure you stay at\nleast 5 metres away and only follow\nfor five minutes \u2013 this is also for your\nown safety as Loggerheads have a very\npowerful jaw.\nDedicated to protecting and\neducating the public on this is Earth,\nSea and Sky Global founded by\nlocal Yannis Vardakastanis in 1993.\nSponsored by Sealife, they have built\na magnificent rescue center last year\non the Southeast corner of the Island\nnear the picturesque Gerakas beach.\nThe number of volunteers vary\ndepending on application and\nduring my month long stay I met\nthirteen wonderful people from all\nover the world. The center is run by\nthe founder Yannis who leads the\nmorning survey daily and Jonna who\nis in charge of the volunteers. We\noften have meals together after the\nlast shift at the adjoining restaurant\nwhich gives us 50% off food.\nAs a volunteer during nesting\nseason, my typical shift involves early\nmorning surveys to count new nests\nand relocate any that are in danger\nof being crushed. You can identify\nnew nests by the fresh flapper tracks\non the sand leading to a small sand\nmount. Although, it takes time to\nget an eye for telling the difference\nbetween a real and abandon nest\nwhich is often less well covered.\nMorning shifts involve opening\nup and cleaning the center, feeding\nthe fishes and running the gift shop.\nEducating and answering questions\nfrom tourists are also important parts\nof our job.\nDuring the midday shift we do a\npeople count at Gerakas beach, which\nCreative side of the volunteer\nexperience painting a sign to accompany the turtle statue at the\nfront of the center Photo: Earth,\nSea and Sky\nExcavation of a nest on one of the\nnesting beaches, ready to be moved\nto a new location.

Photo: Yung Nam Cheah\nis also a nesting ground for data\ncollection in tourism effect on the\nLoggerhead.\nAgain we run the gift shop and at\n15:30 we feed and check if there are\nticks on our resident tortoises in\ntheir enclosure. They are very sneaky\nand take some time to locate! Every\nweek we also feed Diamond the snake\non Friday and the Maury Eel on\nWednesday.\nEvening shifts are quietest for the\nshop and allow us the time to work on\nany projects we initiated during our\nstay. We are encouraged to suggest\nchanges to the information center\nand in such a small organization,\nyour action creates a large impact.\nDuring my month, I helped to paint a\nsign to accompany the newly acquired\ngiant turtle Zantos greeting visitors at\nthe front as well as creating numerous\nposters and translated leaflets for the\ncentre.\nTracks of a female turtle as she\nmakes her way from the ocean to\nthe soft dry sand to nest .

In many\nways I due Foscari can be seen as a\nprecursor to Don Carlo.\nThe story is taken from the Byron\nplay of the same name (The Two\nFoscari). Set in 15th\nCentury Venice, it\ntells of an ageing Doge who has lost\nmost of his family to the plague. His\none remaining son has been accused\nof murder and is to be exiled or\nexecuted. Will the Doge follow his\nduty as a statesman or as a Father?\nDomingo is a singer I have always\nwanted to see live; his powerful voice\nso familiar from The Three Tenors.\nWhile his voice is not the\nglimmering beast of ten years ago, the\nbrilliance of timbre is still there and\nstill unmistakable. He was captivating\nas the Doge and was missed whenever\nabsent from the stage. His acting,\nphrasing and stage presence were\nperfection, however, baritonal his\nvoice is not and his first couple of\nscenes were crying out for a richer\nlower register.\nMeli plays the accused son of the\nDoge. A good actor with a good\nvoice, his highs were beautifully\ncontrolled. In the opening scenes his\nperformance was lacking a degree\nof lyricism but this cleared up as the\nnight went on which may have been\nthe result of some opening night\njitters.\nHowever, one persistent problem\nwas his lack of projection. His voice\ndid not feel big enough for the space\ndespite its tone being indicative of the\nVerdi repertoire.\nAgresta, playing his wife, was\ncaptivating and entertaining, but like\nMeli didn\u2019t truly come into her own\nuntil after the interval.\nThis piece is incredibly compact\nfor an opera. Its three acts clocked\nin at under two hours (excluding\nthe interval) and as such there is not\nmuch time for character development\nwith all characters either being\nroughly painted or merely reduced to\nstereotypes. Cue evil bass villain with\na penchant for power snatching.\nBefore each act a quick synopsis of\nthe action off stage was projected onto\nthe curtain, allowing mood and pace\nto be maintained.\nThe production was hit and miss,\nentertaining and original at times,\nand at others rather non specific and\nbland. Surely Venice does not lack\nvisual inspiration.

    "content": "Sport Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIssue 1585\nImperial duo represent Britain in Triathlon\nAfter 24 hours of travel and\nquite a few more hours spent\ntraining, I finally arrived\nin Edmonton, Canada for the 2014\nWorld Triathlon Series and AgeGroupers\u2019 World Championship.\nFeeling not so jet-fresh due to a\ndelayed arrival, I met the Team GB\nage-groupers for the bike course\nfamiliarization at 8 am the morning\nof my arrival, having built my bike\nin a record 10 minutes. The sense of\nteam pride was clearly displayed as a\npeloton of over 100 riders took to the\nstreets of Edmonton, with motorists\nenthusiastically waving and letting us\nthrough.\nThe following day was pre-race\nday; to me, this means doing bare\nminimum. We headed over to\nthe race village for a swim in the\nchlorinated lake (don\u2019t even get\nme started). The water, I must\nfrustratingly admit, was nearly\nperfect to swim in with all the various\nchemical additions, and was wet-suit\ntemperature. This meant that luckily,\nI had my buoyancy aid for the swim.\nAfter racking bikes the compulsory\n24 hours in advance, we headed back\nfor the welcoming parade of nations.\nThis included a fly-by by Edmonton\u2019s\nair force, and a speech from the\ncoolest mayor ever, Don. Every time\nthe sun came out, the fear of bike\ntyres bursting due to the increased\npressure played on everyone\u2019s mind.\nFinally, it was time for the pasta meal\nand then off to bed in time to wake\nup for the relatively relaxed start of\n5.30 am.\nArriving at the venue on race day,\nI was pleased that not only had my\ntyres survived the heat, but also the\nconditions were perfect for a race.\nThere was no rain - so less likelihood\nof slipping off the bike, something I\nseem to be quite prone to doing.\nAfter The usual warm-up, I joined\nthe rest of my 9.41am female 20-24\nwave in the race village. Nerves were\nhigh as we were led out to the starting\npen by a bag-piper-who\u2019s relevance\nis still very mysterious. At 9.30, the\nfirst and youngest wave was finally\noff. As we took to the start line, the\nfirst of these younger athletes were\nalready coming out of the water.\nFinally, the horn hooted and we were\noff. I seemed to somehow manage\nan amazing dive off the beach start\nand started with a body\u2019s length lead\non everyone else. But this was short\nlived, and at the first buoy, I was\novertaken by the fastest swimmers,\nand into the heart of the brawl. On\nevery stroke I was being dunked\nand struggling for breath, and never\nmanaged to properly find a rhythm\nor do any good sighting, to the point\nBy this point, I had caught up with\nsome of the girls in the age group\nbelow, giving a burst of adrenaline\nwith each overtake. I gave the rest of\nthe run my all, and just managed to\nhold myself up after a sprint finish\npast the grandstand. Everyone from\nall countries present was cheering so\nloudly I couldn\u2019t distinguish a single\nword. The atmosphere was crazy. I\nwas greeted by Hannah Johnston, a\nfellow GB team-mate who\u2019d come\n2nd in the race, who informed me I\u2019d\ncome third. I couldn\u2019t believe it and\ndidn\u2019t believe it until the results were\npinned up.\nAnd there I was, third! A podium\nplace! I\u2019d manage to avoid all bike\nmechanical failures and falls (a\ntriathlete\u2019s worst nightmare), survive\nbeing consistently dunked and finish\nthird in the world Champs in my first\nyear of triathlon. Not only that but\nwe were soon to learn that LauraAnn, fellow Imperial competitor had\nfinished top GB, and 13th overall in\nan extremely competitive age group.\nThis also means that both McGill\nand Simmonds were amongst the few\nto pre-qualify for the 2015 Geneva\nEuropean champs 2015, as well as the\nChicago World Championships later\nin the year.\nFurther qualifying races are taking\nplace in early 2015, and we strongly\nrecommend you give it a go as the\nracing and experience of representing\nyour country is like no other.\nThe weekend was followed by a\nlot of triathlon watching, although\nlimited triathlon doing, as the Elite\nwomen\u2019s and Men\u2019s and U23 races\nwere taking place. We got to witness\nGwen Jorgensen\u2019s inspiring run and\nAlistair Brownlee\u2019s phenomenal win\nin the WTS final.\nThank you firstly to Laura-Ann\nMcGill, my tri-mum without\nwhom I would never have even\nthought it possible to trial for, let\nalone represent GB. Also, thanks\nto Mum and Jethro, for coming\nand supporting and being dragged\naround triathlons without (well\nminimal) complaint. Finally th ank\nyou to Sport Imperial and Team GB\norganisers for helping me get there.\nImogen Simmonds reports on Imperial\u2019s success from Edmonton, Canada\nRunning out of the swim into\nT1: Multi-tasking Photo: ICU\nTriathlon\nElite women's start Photo: ICU Triathlon\nLegging it down the home straight\nPhoto: ICU Triathlon\nwhere I undershot the swim exit and\nhad to veer round 90\u00b0 to get to the\nblue exit carpet.\nOut of the swim, my loyal\nsupporters (mother and brother)\ninformed me that I was in 9th\nposition, much higher than I ever\ncome in the weakest of the three\ndisciplines. I ran towards transition\n(and may have dropped my hat\nand goggles which I go back for to\navoid a 15 second penalty), and into\ntransition area. Here I whip off my\nwetsuit and onto the bike as fast as\npossible. The bike course started with\na hill. As I was struggling to breathe,\nI took this one to try to settle into\nthe bike, and managed to overtake\na couple of my opponents on the\nway up. The rest of the bike course\nwas flat, albeit windy, and I was glad\nmy trusted Scott was not blessed\nwith rims or a disk wheel, as this\nwould undoubtedly have led to being\nthrown across the highly ventilated\nbridge.\nAfter 2 laps and no falls, it was off\nthe bike and into T2. As I began the\nrun, I realised just how hard I had\npushed on the bike as I felt the initial\nsigns of cramping in my calves. As\ninstructed in my first race this year,\nI took the advice of James Ellis and\n\u201ctook the first 500 gently\u201d. After\nsurviving this, I knew the likelihood\nof cramp was slim, so I went for it\nthen, running as hard as I could.\nParading about Edmonton Photo: ICU Triathlon\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 39\nFELIX\nSport Editor: Kunal Wagle\n24.10.2014\nThe Imperial Falcons Softball\nteam was looking to improve\non their dismal last place\nshowing at the 2014 National\nUniversity Softball Championships\n(NUSC) Spring Cup. Drawing on\n8 players from the baseball and 5\nnew female members of the club,\nthe team look set to get the one win\nthey needed to improve their dismal\nsoftball track record.\nThe first game proved to be a\nsetback however, with the Falcons\nfalling to the Nottingham Swingers\nA team. The Falcons took the field\nfirst, but a walk saw the Swingers\u2019\nleadoff man get on base, which would\nprove detrimental as he eventually\ncame home on a sacrifice fly by their\nfourth batter before the Falcons\nclosed out the inning with a strikeout.\nThe bottom of the inning proved a\nquiet affair for the Falcons despite\na hit from leadoff Eduardo as they\nwent quietly without scoring a run.\nThe Falcons then had a disastrous\ntop inning in the second, giving up\na mercy rule 5 runs despite no hits\ncoming from the Swingers. In the\nbottom, the Falcons sought to get\nback in the game with leadoff Yuki\ngetting a single before a combination\nof errors and walks drawn by Carole\nand Jacques saw the Falcons hit back\nwith a mercy rule inning of their own\nwith runs scored by Yuki, Carole,\nRhys and Jacques and Eduardo. The\nfinal inning saw the Falcons give up a\nfurther 3 runs while giving up a 1-2-3\ninning at bat. Taking a 1 run penalty\nper inning for not having enough\ngirls, the Falcons saw their hopes\ngetting that coveted first softball win\ndelayed further with the 12-5 loss to\nthe Swingers.\nDespite the loss, team morale\nremained high and the Falcons\nkept their hopes alive with an\ninvigorating performance against\nthe Loughborough Thunder B\nteam. This time, the Falcons were\nthe benefactors of the penalty rule,\nhaving 4 girls on the field against\nthe 3 in the Thunder\u2019s team. Again,\nhaving won the toss, the Falcons\ntook the field first. With renewed\nvigor, the fielding side put up a\nstrong performance off the back of\nsome strong pitching and a stellar\nfielding performance which included\na remarkable diving stop from\nthird baseman Stephane. Despite\nthe performance, the Falcons gave\nup 2 runs on 2 hits before getting\nout of the inning with 2 strikeouts.\nNow down by 2 runs, the Falcons\ncame back with a vengeance with the\nfirst four batters from Eduardo to\nEsther all drawing walks before Yuki\ngrounded into a fielder\u2019s choice with\nAnqi out at home on the forced play.\nCarole then drew another walk to\nbring in another run before Zack hit\nin two runs with a line drive single.\nDespite Catherine\u2019s strike out, third\nbaseman Stephane drew the walk\nneeded to end the inning on the\nmercy rule.\nLeads come and go quickly in\nslowpitch softball and the Falcons\nknew that they\u2019d need to be on their\ntoes to protect their lead. Heading\ninto the top of the second, pitcher\nAshley finally found his groove and\nhad an almost perfect inning with\n2 strikeouts, 1 walk and an infield\npop fly that came right back to\nhim. Having held their opponents\nscoreless, the Falcons came out again\nlooking to do some damage and they\ngot just that with another mercy rule\ninning coming off 1 hit from Yuki,\nhelped along by 2 errors and 3 walks\ndrawn by Alex, Carole and Catherine.\nWith an unassailable 8 run lead, the\nFalcons headed into the final inning\nto close out the game. The first out\ncame easy enough with an infield\nfly ball caught by third baseman\nStephane. However, after that, things\nstarted to unravel as pitcher Ashley\ncommitted a throwing error to first\nfollowed by 2 hits and 2 walks which\nsaw the Thunder put 4 on the board\nbefore the Falcons finally managed\nto get out of the jam with 2 fly balls\nto centerfield Yuki and shortstop\nEduardo respectively. Having the\nhome field advantage, the Falcons\ndidn\u2019t need to bat again and closed\nthe game out 16-9 after penalties.\nBuoyed by their first ever softball\nwin, Falcons morale was riding high\nas they went into the final group\nstage game against their baseball\narch rivals, the UEA Blue Sox. Again\nwinning the toss, the Falcons took\nthe field first and managed to see out\nUEA for a single run off the back of\nsome strong pitching and fielding.\nThe Falcons then came racing out of\nthe gates at bat with 4 runs scoring\noff 3 hits from Eduardo, Ashley and\nYuki, as well as 3 walks drawn by\nChristina, Zack and Catherine. The\nnext inning however, saw the Blue\nSox getting back in the game off a\npitching meltdown from the Falcons\nas pitcher Ashley gave 4 walks to\nallow the Blue Sox a mercy rule\ninning to regain the lead. Thankfully,\ntheir lead was short-lived as the\nFalcons rallied to save the game at\nbatting with a mercy rule inning of\ntheir own off a hit from Eduardo, 2\nerrors and 4 walks drawn by Anqi,\nAshley, Yuki and Christina.\nBack on top, the Falcons found\nrenewed strength despite giving up\nan inside-the-park home run to the\nBlue Sox\u2019s leadoff man. The next 3\nouts came in quick succession and\nthe Falcons closed the inning out for\n1 run, bringing the score to 10-9 to\nUEA after adding penalty runs. The\nFalcons now needed 2 runs to walk\noff the game and the mood was tense\nas ninth batter Vincent stepped up to\nthe plate to lead off. Unfortunately,\nthe final inning would prove to be an\nanticlimactic one as the Blue Sox gave\nup 4 walks in succession to give up\nthe win off a \u201cwalk-off walk\u201d to third\nbatter Ashley.\nOn the strength of their 2-1 win\nloss record and 31 conceded runs\n(after penalties), the Falcons set\nanother club record by making it\nto their first ever slowpitch softball\nsemi-final against the top seeds from\nthe University of Portsmouth. The\nFalcons started off strongly to get\n1 run off hits from Eduardo and\nChristina, helped along by 3 walks\ndrawn by Anqi, Ashley and Esther.\nAs the Falcons came on the field, a\nstrong errorless fielding performance\nsaw them holding the top of the\nPortsmouth order scoreless to close\nout the inning. The next inning\nhowever, saw Falcon bats shut out\nand the Portsmouth team started\nto show their top seed credentials as\nsome excellent fielding kept Falcon\nbats at bay while they scored 4 runs\noff 4 hits. As the next inning came\nround, the Falcons managed to put\none more run on the board courtesy\nof a triple from Yuki which scored\nEsther but it was too little too late,\nand the Portsmouth team closed\nthe game our 9-2 with penalty runs\nadded.\nThe Falcons then played the third\nand fourth placing playoff game\nagainst the Loughborough A team\nwhich started a very tight affair,\nwith both teams shutting out the\ntop of each other\u2019s order in the first\ninning before a series of 5 hits from\nthe bottom of the Loughborough\norder brought in 4 runs in the top\nof the second inning. With things\nlooking grim, the tired Falcon squad\ncould not mount a return salvo and\nLoughborough A team shut out the\nFalcons to end the inning. Despite\nshutting out their opponents again\nin the top of the third, the bottom of\nthe third would see the Falcons fail\nin their comeback attempt as their\nopponents shut them out again to\nclose out the game 7-0 winners after\nadding penalty runs.\nDespite their losses in the last two\ngames by 7 run margins, the Falcons\ntake great heart in their performance,\nhaving gained their first 2 slowpitch\nsoftball wins and made their first ever\nNUSC semi-final appearance. The\nFalcons will be looking to train hard\nover the winter and come back even\nstronger when the Spring tournament\nseason comes around in March.\nRugby 1st XV hold out for crucial victory over Reading\nImperial kicked off the season\nagainst newly relegated Reading\nat Harlington in what could be\nan early promotion clash.Off\nthe back of a good pre-season,\nand with a new coach,IC were\noptimistic about the season ahead.\nFortunately,there was a break\nfrom the recent bad weather,\nwhich allowed a good fast game of\nrugby.\nA new look Imperial (five full\n1st team debuts plus one off\nthe bench) were quick off the\nline and won an early penalty in\nthe ruck,allowing captain Cox\nto put the first points on the\nboard for the season.There was\nsome neat work under the high\nball from fresher Toby Simpson\nand newly converted No.8 Joe\nBowden.However,a lack of match\nsharpness was evident in some of\nthe initial exchanges,with a few\nImperial handling errors amongst\nthe good work,leading to a couple\nof soft tries for Reading.\nIC grew back into the game in\ntraditional style with a powerful\nmaul off the line out,leading to\nyet another try for David NielsenScott in the corner.A missed\nconversion from Cox brought the\nscore to 12-8 in favour of the away\nside.A tough period in the game\nfollowed,where no side gave a\nyard,with big hits coming in left,\nright and centre.Another huge\nmaul marched the visitors fifty\nmetres down the pitch,leading to\nan IC penalty and a sin-binning for\nReading.Imperial continued to\nturn the screw,and set up another\ncouple of penalties for Cox to take\nus into half time with a narrow\nlead.\nThe second half carried where\nthe first left off.The new look\nfront row of Adam\u2018Motley Crew\u2019\nPostlewaite and fresher Nathan\nTomlinson combined well with\nclub veteran Tom Hobson to\ndestroy a Reading scrum.More\nimperial pressure gave Postlewaite\nthe chance to burrow over the line,\nand Cox duly added the extras.\nQuick ball was regularly on offer\nand this allowed Rigsoc co-founder\nSam Moorby and Chris Macbeth\nto make good yards through\nmidfield.Macbeth danced through\na number of tackles and was pulled\nup just short of the Reading line,\nbut partner in crime Moorby was\non hand to finish off.More big hits\ncame in,one in particular leaving\nBowden seeing stars,eventually\nleading to him being replaced by\nRuaridh Mckay,who slotted in\neasily and found time to have the\nReading scrum half rear Rangered.\nEngland international Billy\nTwelvetrees also came on for his\ndebut at full back.\nJust as IC seemed set to ease to\nvictory,our other,less-famous,\ninternational Olisa Ufodiama\nspoilt an otherwise impressive\nperformance and decided he\nfancied the last ten minutes of\nthe game off for a rest in the\nsin bin.Hopefully the 700 press\nup punishment afterwards will\nbe a sufficient deterrent in the\nfuture.Reading managed to get\na converted try to bring the score\nback to 26-22,and set up a nervy\nfinal five minutes.Everyone dug\nin deep,and,with the assistance\nof Luke Armatige's cider wielding\narmy on the sideline,IC held on for\na big win.\nJOE BOWDEN\n1ST XV RUGBY\nASHLEY NG DING WEN\nICBC CHAIR\nFalcons make semi-finals in UK Softball Championship\n\n"

Based at St.\nMary's Hospital in Paddington, the\ncentre aims to provide solutions\nin healthcare through intelligent\nand low cost design. Formed less\nthan a year ago as a collaboration\nbetween the Royal College of Art\nand Imperial College, London; I was\nreally enthusiastic about this, both as\na medic and someone interested in\nclever and elegant design. It promised\nto be an exciting integration of fields\nnot often thought of together. I sat\ndown with Maja Kecman, a specialist\nin healthcare design working at\nHELIX, to see if the hype was\njustified:\nKamil: So can you tell me a little\nbit about what you do at HELIX?\nMaja: HELIX stands for Healthcare\nInnovation Exchange so it is all about\nthe sharing of ideas and know-how\nbetween doctors, researchers and\ndesigners to create products that\nhave a real impact on healthcare\nand disease management. We\u2019re\nreally privileged to be based here in\nSt. Mary\u2019s Hospital because we can\nvery easily test our prototypes in a\nclinical setting and see what could\nbe improved. Also, being at the top\ntrauma centre in London means\nthat we have access to expertise that\nwouldn\u2019t be available elsewhere. It\u2019s a\ngreat place to be!\nK: And so, how is an idea usually\nthought of? Are you approached by\npeople working in the healthcare\nenvironment or do you yourselves\nspend time on the wards or in\nclinics looking for things that\ncould be improved on?\nM: It\u2019s a bit of a mixture of both.\nBecause we\u2019re quite young as a\ncentre, we have only quite recently\nstarted offering consultations to\noutside people. Otherwise, it\u2019s mostly\neither spending time in healthcare\nenvironments or just looking at\ndisease statistics to see what the big\nproblems are and working from there.\nFor example, back in 2009 as part of\nthe RCA\u2019s Helen Hamlyn Centre\nfor Design, my colleague Gianpaolo\nFusari spent time with paramedics to\nlook into problems with the current\ndesign of ambulances. This helped\nhim learn about issues such as the\npoor layout of storage spaces and the\ndifficulty cleaning the back of the\nvehicle and led to an award-winning\nredesign of UK ambulances. Another\nexample is our Asthma Project where\nI started with the statistics that 75%\nof asthma hospital admissions and\n90%of deaths are preventable. As\nyou can see, these are pretty shocking\nnumbers so I did some research into\nthat and came up with a simple app\nfor children to help with compliance\nand monitoring of the disease.\nK: Could you tell me a bit more\nabout this asthma app?\nM: So I started out with this statistic\nand then basically needed to\nsearch for a cause. After spending\ntime in an asthma clinic at Royal\nBrompton Hospital and talking\nto some specialists in asthma, it\nseemed like a major factor in these\nstatistics is the incorrect use of the\ninhaler. Of course, this could have\nmeant redesigning the inhaler but\nthat would have meant having to\nchange too much. So instead, we\ncame up with an app that would\nhelp kids measure lung function as\nwell as monitoring the management\nof their condition over time. It\u2019s\nsimple, cheap and easy to use and\npreliminary studies in patients seem\nto suggest it is effective and quite\npopular.\nK: Is making cheap ideas quite\ncentral to HELIX's practice then?\nM: Absolutely! Frugality is one our\ncentral principles. It makes our\nideas more easily implementable\nand realistic so they don\u2019t just stay\nas research but actually become a\nproduct. Also, from more of a global\nKamil McClelland speaks to Maja Kecman, a specialist in medical design\nat the HELIX Centre\nhealth perspective, it means that we\ncan roll it out to developing countries\nwho would otherwise not be able to\nafford it. So going back to this app, we\nare hoping to expand it to India, with\nthe help of one of our international\ncollaborators there. This will mean\ntesting it on 200 children and really\nseeing whether it can effectively\nbe rolled out on a wide scale and in\nsettings and cultures different to the\nUK.\nK: Have you done any other\ninternational work in settings\noutside the NHS?\nM: Not yet, but it\u2019s certainly an area\nthat we want to expand in the future.\nAt the moment, we\u2019ve just been\nworking inside the British system\nbecause this is where we are based and\nwhat we know. But, by making our\ndesigns cheap, simple and scalable,\nwe hope this will make them more\nfeasible business models that can be\nexpanded abroad more easily. And\nI think that is what sets us apart\nfrom other research centres looking\nat healthcare design: we want to, at\nthe end of the day, create an actual\nmarketable product as opposed to\njust a research project that never goes\nbeyond the early stages.\nThis means we think a lot about\nhow to make our ideas implementable and we also work closely with\nbusiness people to advance our\ndesigns into viable creations.\nIt\u2019s probably best to think of us as a\ncollection of healthcare design start-ups with the unique benefit of being\nclosely linked to a hospital.\n\"We have\naccess to\nexpertise\nthat\nwouldn't be\navailable\nanywhere\nelse\"\n\"Most\npeople at\nthe RCA\nactually\nhave a\nbackground\nin\nengineering\"\nK: And how has it been working on\nhealthcare design as someone who\ntrained at RCA? Does it have some\nunique challenges that you weren't\nexpecting?\nM: First of all, a common\nmisconception about the RCA is that\nit is all fine art. Around 80% is design\nand in fact everyone here has some\nkind of background in engineering or\nindustrial design. In terms of working\nin healthcare, I\u2019ve been working in\nthe field for the past ten years but it\ncertainly does have its own problems.\nThere\u2019s a lot of bureaucracy and\nregulation and this makes progress\ndifficult. Being embedded in the\nhospital does help on this front as this\nstreamlines the process somewhat.\nThis is one of the reasons we don\u2019t\ndeal with surgical instruments.\nAnother problem with hospitals is\nthat, because of their organisation,\nit\u2019s really difficult to bring in\nwidespread change. They aren\u2019t\nlike a supermarket chain where\neach individual shop has the same\nformat so changes can very easily\nbe implemented across the board. A\nhospital\u2019s more like a collection of\nlittle corner shops, each one slightly\ndifferent, each with a different\nmanagerial structure that needs to be\napproached separately. This is what\nwards are like let alone hospitals,\ntrusts and the NHS as a whole so you\ncan imagine some of the problems\nfaced when trying to bring change.\nK: Finally, I wanted to ask you a\nlittle bit about the future and what\nyou think it holds for HELIX.\nYou talked briefly about wanting\na greater international focus to\nHELIX, are there any other plans\nyou have for the centre?\nM: That\u2019s definitely a key part of\nwhat we want to be doing as we go\nforward. If you look at the Mayo\nClinic's Center for Innovation in\nthe US, they do a similar thing to us\nbut mostly focus on creating designs\nfor their own clinic so I feel being part\nof IGHI with its global perspective\nmeans we are doing something new.\nWhen I visited there five years ago,\nthey were as small as we are currently\nbut now employ around 30 designers.\nSo I\u2019m optimistic for the future! Also,\nas we roll out our products and earn\nsome money, we\u2019re hoping to become\nmore financially self-sufficient so we\ndon\u2019t have to rely on outside funding.\nI think this will be a key step for us\nand hopefully help drive even more\ndesign innovation. So it\u2019s an exciting\ntime at the moment in the centre\nwith a lot of change ahead!\n\n"

This awful pun aside, I\nfelt that the article unfortunately\nmisrepresented and undermined\nImperial College Union\u2019s \u2018Dri\u2019 night,\nits first ever alcohol-free club night.\nThe event was aimed at students\nwho, for various reasons, don\u2019t drink,\nand might not feel comfortable with\none of the Union\u2019s typical boozy\nnights. This includes students under\nthe age of 18 who cannot attend\nUnion events at which alcohol is\nserved, or even enter Union bars,\ndue to licensing restrictions. These\nstudents are socially marginalized\nand excluded from most of the fun\nof Freshers\u2019 Week events and are not\nable to make use of the social hub that\nis the Union bars.\nDri night provided an opportunity\nfor this group to access some of the\nfacilities that the rest of us take for\ngranted, an opportunity that around\na hundred people, many of whom will\nhave been under 18, took advantage\nof and presumably enjoyed. In this\nrespect the event was a success.\nThe article puts forward the\ncontention that Dri night was\nsome sort of Union ghost town\nexperience, with tumbleweed rolling\nacross the sticky floors of Metric\nand FiveSixEight. However, with\nattendance in three figures this can\u2019t\nhave been the quietest Monday night\nthat the Union has seen this term,\nand seasoned veterans will all be able\nto remember nights in the Union bars\nwhen everyone present would have\nbeen able to fit into a cab.\nQuoting a dubious \u201canonymous\nUnion source\u201d with criticisms of the\nevent, and ambiguously presenting\na photo of the inside of Metric not\ntaken at the event (captioned as\nan \u2018artist\u2019s impression\u2019 on page 7,\nbut left uncaptioned on the front\ncover), doesn\u2019t seem to be a fair\nrepresentation of the night. They\ndidn\u2019t seem to ask any people who\nwere there if they enjoyed themselves\neither, which might have given a\nmore accurate view of the event.\nProviding events for non-drinkers,\nand especially under-18s, is a worthy\ngoal. Indeed it was one of Chris\nKaye\u2019s (this year\u2019s Deputy President\n(Welfare)) manifesto pledges.\nThis kind of unreasonable attack\non an event that benefited students\nprejudices the Imperial community\nagainst any other events that seek\nto include those who can\u2019t, don\u2019t or\nwon\u2019t drink, and negatively impacts\non their ability to interact with other\nstudents and have a good time.\nThe original article, as published in last week's issue. Photo: Carol Ann Cheah\nNICK FARMER\nCOMMENT WRITER\nDri night\u2019s coverage does not whet the appetite\nOliver Benton\u2019s response...\nThanks for the response; I'm glad\nat least somebody,other than\nthe Union staff and Sabbs that\n\u2018checked over it\u2019,actually read the\narticle.\nI feel that the article may have\nbeen slightly misinterpreted.\nWhile I can,but won't,apologise\nfor the puns that littered it,I do not\nfeel that it misrepresented Dri.\nThere are a huge proportion of\nstudents at Imperial that don't\ndrink,and even more that don't\ndrink to excess.\nImperial College,and the Union,\ncould do a lot more to include\nthese students and engage with\nthem.How to actually achieve this\nis the tricky part and something I\ncan't pretend to have a solution for.\nSocial marginalisation of any\nstudent here is outright wrong and\neverything should be done to avoid\nthis.\nWhile slightly tongue in cheek,\n(think of all the pun opportunities)\nthe\u2018unreasonable attack\u2019was an\narticle on an event that flopped.\nWell-intentioned,this loss leader\nto get people to come to the Union\nclearly didn't work.\nPart of Felix's job is to hold the\nUnion to account.This is sometimes\nuncomfortable,as shown by the\npre-emptive press release by the\nSabb team,but if an event doesn\u2019t\nwork then that's unfortunate.\nThe idea to cater to nondrinkers is a good one,only the\nimplementation didn\u2019t come off.\nWhile the choice of my sources may\nseem\u201cdubious\u201d,unfortunately they\noften want to remain anonymous\nto protect their job,degree,\nfriendships etc.\nThe suggestion that my source was\nfictional is false but you\u2019re going to\nhave to take my word for that.\nNick Farmer responds to Felix\u2019s article about the Union\u2019s inaugural non-alcoholic night\n\"The article\nmisrepresented\nand\nundermined\nthe Union's Dri\nnight.\"\n\n"

The other,\nshamefully named after this great\nartist, is something of an anticlimax.\nThe Turner Prize, now in its 30th year,\nis meant to showcase the best of what\nBritish art has to offer, helping define\nhow the country\u2019s art shall progress.\nWell, if that is true, it\u2019s not looking\ngood; this year\u2019s celebrations went off\nwith little more than a whimper.\nThe Turner Prize has never shied\naway from controversy; in fact, it has\nalmost become a defining feature\nof the show. This was especially true\nback in the late 90\u2019s when the Young\nBritish Artists \u2013 Damien Hirst,\nTracey Emin and the like \u2013 were\nbeginning to establish themselves\non the art scene. Whether this art\nis actually any good is a debate for\nanother time but it was certainly\nnew and exciting and something that\nforced you to reconsider how you\nviewed art. More recently though,\nthe Turner Prize has too consciously\ntried to be controversial, engineered\nto provoke a reaction as opposed to\nsimply displaying the best of Britain\u2019s\ncurrent art and letting us decide what\nto make of it. The public has grown\nweary, and the formula for success\nthat had once worked so well is now\nbackfiring, pushing the Prize into\nirrelevance.\nSo as you can see I had my doubts as\nI entered the gallery but I tried to not\nlet this cloud my judgment. I can\u2019t\nsay the first artist, James Richards,\nmade it easy for me: seeing a flower\nslowly being stroked across a man\u2019s\nsphincter gave quite a jarring first\nimpression. Oh Turner Prize, how I\nmissed you!\nRosebud by Richards explores\ncensorship of artwork, showing\nclose-ups of art books in Tokyo where\nthe genitalia has been scratched out\nto comply with their strict laws. It\nis pornographic, shocking, asking\nwhether art can ever be censored.\nBut it is also meandering, tiresome, a\nstory with no plot.\nI was hoping, after the torment\nof Richards\u2019 piece, for things to get\nbetter. It was Tris Vonna-Michell\u2019s\nturn: not the best of starts when\neven the explanation of his works\ndescribed them as \u2018confusing\u2019. How\nwas I going to manage? But seriously,\nwhat was his work even supposed to\nbe? I was trying to create meaning\nfor it in my head: perhaps it was\na comment on the confusion and\nneuroticism of the modern world. It\nwas as if the space had been thrown\ntogether, a random collection of\nslideshows and photographs that\nadded nothing to your experience.\nAll the while, an incomprehensible\nvoice played over the speakers, like\nthe stream-of-consciousness of a\nmadman. Then came his film, where\nhe takes you on a journey back to\nBerlin, searching for a place that no\nlonger exists. Was he trying to look at\nthe confusion of memory and reality?\nWho knows? Probably not even him.\nThree of the four installations\nthis year were video works, a sign of\nthe times but also a shame: I would\nhave liked to see a greater range of\nmedia. Video art is not like other art\nforms where you can lapse in and\nout of consciousness and still have a\nsense of what is going on. Video art\nrequires your full attention, all the\ntime. Three video works, then, was\noverwhelming and quite fatiguing,\nespecially as some of the artists\nexpected you to sit through over 50\nminutes of video. I see myself as a\npatient person but this is taking the\npiss a bit. No one has time for that!\nVideo collages are very in vogue at\nthe moment, suggestive of a post-internet generation that has grown\nup with the digital revolution. How\nto portray this online world and its\ncultural repercussions seems to be\na real point of debate in art at the\nmoment. Video and sound art seems\nto be one answer as artists struggle\nto manipulate orthodox media.\nHowever, the attempts provided\nat the Turner Prize have proven\ndisappointing, not able to boil down\nthe essence of this world into succinct\npieces of art.\nAs you can tell, I wasn\u2019t too\nimpressed with what I saw. The artists\nare nominated based on exhibitions\nput on over the past 12 months and\nthese previous exhibitions are also\nwhat determines the winner so what\nis on display really has no influence\non the final outcome (thankfully).\nSome of these previous exhibitions\nwere actually rather widely praised,\nmost notably Duncan Campbell\u2019s\nentry for the Venice Biennale. It\nis such a shame, then, that what is\non show here really does nothing \u2013\nespecially seeing as you are expected\nto pay \u00a311 to enter.\nThe remaining video artist,\nDuncan Campbell, built on his\nIrish background to create a mock\ndocumentary exploring the country\u2019s\nturbulent past, quite a poignant piece\nbut just as exciting as you would\nexpect a fake news piece from forty\nyears ago to be. Sitting through the\nwhole thing proved to be an effort.\nCiara Phillips, the only artist not to\ndo a video piece, offered up a room\nplastered from floor to ceiling in\noverlapping prints, repeating images\nlike frames from a film reel. Overlaid\nonto this were bold, strong colours,\nattempting to inject some vitality\ninto an exhibit that left little effect.\nI left the exhibition without\nthe feeling in my gut that follows\nprofound and perspective altering\nshows, just a strange hollowness.\nYes, some of the works touched on\ninteresting topics, like Campbell\u2019s\nwork exploring how objective truth\ncan be manipulated in media so that\neven our eyes deceive us. But I just\ndon\u2019t feel video art in the way it was\npresented did it any favours. I wasn\u2019t\nthe only one who felt that way, as the\ncomments on the board outside the\nexit showed (although in slightly less\nmeasured words).\nMy advice to anyone considering\ngoing: don\u2019t. It\u2019s not worth your time.\nI\u2019m going to be generous and say\nthat this is not the best of what some\nof these artists have to offer and, at\n\u00a311, it is simply not worth it for a\ncompetition that is looking more and\nmore irrelevant as time goes on. Go\ninstead to the Late Turner exhibition\ndownstairs, which provides you with\na completely new perspective on the\ngreat artist. Who will be the winner of\nthis year\u2019s \u00a325,000 prize, announced\nin December? For me at least, none\nof the artists emerges as an obvious\nfrontrunner.\n30th\nSept 2014 to 4th\nJan 2015\nTate Britain\nTickets \u00a311 (regular), \u00a36 (student)\nCiara Phillips, Things Shared, Turner Prize 2014 Photo: Tate Photography\n\"The\nTurner\nPrize has\ntried too\nconsciously\nto provoke\na reaction\"\n\n"

Of\ncourse, it\u2019s easy for them to say that\nthe opening line,\n\u201cBecause you know\nI\u2019m all about that bass\n\u2018Bout that bass, no treble\u201d\nis completely ridiculous, given that\nthe song in fact, is not entirely bass\nbased. But petty niggles aside, the\nsong can have an entirely different\ninterpretation, depending how\npragmatic or fastidious you choose\nto be.\nTrainor, who claims not to consider\nherself a feminist, puts it simply: \u201cwe\nwanted to write a fun song for the\nworld, and we thought, why not do a\nsong about loving yourself and loving\nyour body, because I don\u2019t think girls\nreally love themselves as much as\nthey should\u201d.\n\u201cI see the magazine workin\u2019 that\nPhotoshop\nWe know that shit ain\u2019t real\nC\u2019mon now, make it stop\nIf you got beauty, beauty, just raise \u2018em\nup\n\u2018Cause every inch of you is perfect\nFrom the bottom to the top\u201d\nOn the surface, Meghan Trainor\nappears to succeed. It doesn\u2019t take a\nfeminist to recognise that promoting\nthe idea of beauty not being defined\nby the photoshopped images we see so\nfrequently in the media is undeniably\npositive and empowering.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard this song, by\nsome miracle, you might not know\nthat the message is aimed mainly at\ngirls and women who \u201cain\u2019t no size\ntwo\u201d. But where the song tends to\nfall down and be reprimanded by\nfeminists, is in the choruses.\n\u201cYeah, my mama she told me don\u2019t worry\nabout your size\nShe says, \u2018Boys like a little more booty to\nhold at night\u2019.\u201d\nNow of course, this isn\u2019t great. It\u2019s\nnever a good idea to base your self-esteem on your attractiveness to the\nopposite sex. While I disagree heartily\nwith needing male validation for\nself-acceptance, it is true that women\nwho are, as one article berating\nthe song describes it, \u201cpleasantly\nchubby\u201d, are constantly told that\nthey are unattractive and unworthy\nthroughout their lives. They often\ngrow up being told that no one will\never be attracted to them, and it can\ntake a long time to organically gain\nenough self-confidence to fight this,\nand accept that they are worthy of\nrespect. For once, it\u2019s nice to be told,\ntruthfully, that (some) men will fancy\nyou, whether you\u2019re a size six or a\nsixteen or a twenty-six.\nTrainor doesn\u2019t generally engage\nin feminist discussion. It is likely\nthat she, along with the majority of\nlisteners of this song, aren\u2019t reading\ninto this song with the same ferocity\nand vigilance as those who with to\nrebuke it. When Trainor says,\n\u201cYou know I won\u2019t be no stick figure\nsilicone Barbie doll\nSo if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into then go\nahead and move along\u201d\nshe isn\u2019t saying that it\u2019s wrong for\nany heterosexual man to be attracted\nto any woman who doesn\u2019t fit her\nbody type, or indeed that all men\nwill find her attractive. What she\u2019s in\nfact saying is that she is the way she\nis, she is attractive, and if you don\u2019t\nthink so, then that\u2019s not her problem.\nWhen you take it on a basic level, as\nwritten by someone who really just\nwants curvy girls to feel good about\nthemselves, that\u2019s pretty body-positive, isn\u2019t it?\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the only\nproblem that people are finding with\nthis song.\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing booty back\nGo ahead and tell them skinny bitches\nthat\nNo I\u2019m just playing. I know you think\nyou\u2019re fat\nBut I\u2019m here to tell ya\nEvery inch of you is perfect from the\nbottom to the top\u201d\nThe question that arises here is\nwhether or not this is name-calling\nor skinny-shaming. I don\u2019t think,\nand I\u2019m sure that the writers of this\ntrack don\u2019t think, that this addresses\nall skinny girls as bitches. This\naddresses the subset of people who\nmay have something vindictive to\nsay about voluptuous girls, who, by\nand large, will not be of a full-figured\nbody type. This comment is aimed\nat those, particularly those who are\nskinny, who may consider themselves\nsuperior because of their diminutive\nTESSA DAVEY\nSECTION EDITOR\n\"It's incredibly\nrare to see\nmusic aimed at\nthe acceptance\nof curvier\nwomen [...], so\nwhy not let us\nbigger girls\nhave this one?\"\nsize. This isn\u2019t an attack on all\nskinny women, suggesting that they\nonly have a right to feel good about\nthemselves as they have the same\nbody insecurities as larger women. It\ndoesn\u2019t force a limited definition of\nattractiveness, it just points out that\nwomen (whose attractiveness is often\nmarginalised) can be just as hot as\nthose prescribed by the media, and\ndeserve to know it.\nIn my opinion, this song is\nempowering to women who don\u2019t\nfit the culturally preferred norm\nof minimised curves. While the\nsong might not be perfect, it doesn\u2019t\nencourage fatter women to start\nslinging mud at skinny girls. It may\ncontain concepts that are problematic\nwhen examined under the\nmicroscope, but it\u2019s certainly far from\ntoxic. It\u2019s incredibly rare to see music\naimed at the acceptance of curvier\nwomen (while big booty pride is\neverywhere at the moment, it\u2019s mostly\nwithin the realms of complimenting a\nitty bitty waist), so why not just let us\nbigger girls have this one?\nThose who criticise this song seem\nto think that nothing that preaches\nacceptance is valid, unless it preaches\nconsistent acceptance on all levels.\nThis is a gallant aim, but it simply\ndoesn\u2019t exist. Meghan Trainor is\nusing her personal identification\nas a curvy girl to encourage other\ngirls to feel good about themselves,\nand if even one person who has low\nself-esteem feels even a little bit more\nconfident about themselves in any\nway whatsoever, then this song is a\npositive influence. Calling for the\nsong to be banned serves only to deny\ngirls who identify with it any outlet\nfor their personal acceptance, which is\nby no means fair.\nPhoto: Epic Records\n\n"
