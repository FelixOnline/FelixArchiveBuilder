    "content": "Attention all Election Candidates\nThe papers for the sabbatical elections go up\n.next Friday and soon we will be flooded with\npublicity for ICU and C CU elections. After\ngiving the matter of elections some thought it\nhas become apparent to me that it is very\ndifficult to be both informative and completely\nunbiased. After all, it is hard for the electorate\nat Imperial College to make informed\ndecisions, when all they have to rely on is the\ncandidates' own publicity in the form of\nposters, handouts, a FELIX manifesto, IC\nRadio and STOIC's promos.\nFor this reason I have decided to run a special series of Soapbox articles running up\nto the elections. Starting next week I invite any\nmember of College to submit articles on why\nthey think they are the right candidate for a post or alternatively why someone else isn't. You could even say what qualities you would\nexpect from anybody standing for a particular\nposition.\nIf the articles are concise, informative and to\nthe point then I shall attempt to print as many\nas possible. This unique service gives both\ncandidates and electorate the chance to say\nexactly what they want about the elections.\nThe only limitations will be length, factual\naccuracy and, of course, the laws of libel.\nSo to start the ball rolling.\nMr Harold Christopher Webb\nThis week Chris Webb, former External\nAffairs Officer, came into the office to ask me\nabout publicity charges. It is rumoured that Mr\nWebb is proposing to stand for ICU President.\nIn my opinion (and remember that these are\npurely my personal feelings), Chris Webb is\njust about the worst person who could\npossibly stand for this post. The past two years\nhave been typified by a middle of the road\n\"reasonable\" ICU President. John Passmore\nhad the added quality of being completely lazy\nand a bit of a drunk, whilst Nick Morton, who\nis a terribly nice person, has probably not\nachieved everything he wanted to merely\nbecause he is too easy going to stand up to\nCollege.\nChris Webb, on the other hand is so wet\nthat he resembles Bangladesh after the\nravages of the monsoon. He is an ardent Tory,'\nbut is so middle of the road that he makes the\nSDP look like the Hitler Youth. If he is elected\nas ICU President then I think it will be a dark\nday for IC Union.\nI can see him now, agreeing with the Rector\nover a large glass of claret and selling the\nstudents down the river. He is a born politician\nand as such has ambition which greatly\noutweighs his ability. Sincerity is a word which\nwould not pass my lips when describing him.\nWhat we need is a President with firm\nopinions who will represent the students\nstrongly to the College authorities. Chris\nWebb is not such a person.\nValentine's Day\nNext week there will be a special Valentines\nsection in the Small Ads column. Please collect\nforms from the office and return by 5:30pm on\nTuesday if you want a short message included.\nPublicity Offer\nThis time of year always becomes a bit of a pain in the arse when the swarms of\nprospective sabbaticals arrive at the office two\ndays before the elections wanting posters\nprinted. In a move to encourage would-be\nsabbaticals to get publicity in early, I am\nintending to have a special discount price for\nany publicity handed (complete and ready for\nprinting) to me by 5:30pm on Tuesday.\nThis special offer is open to all candidates\nand will allow those who have planned their\nideas well the chance to benefit just a little.\nThey could have a few extra posters and\nhandouts or even save some money!\nMy very own radio show\nI have accepted the invitation to appear on IC\nRadio on Tuesday evening at about 8:00pm. I will be interviewed live on air by ace presenter\nMo and will be asked about many aspects of\nCollege life and, of course, FELIX.\nSo listen in on Tuesday if you want to learn\nwho James Deeny really is and where he buys\nhis coffee.\nCredits\nMy thanks this week to Lesley, Pallab, Peter,\nJames (star), Paul, Eddie, Alistair, Soheel (still\ngoing strong), Nick, Steve, Martin S.,J. Martin, Jez, Mo, all the other colla tors( inc. N. Willson), Ian and Maz.\nThose of you who remember Weatherspoon\nmay remember that near his cottage a long\nstraight path crosses a long straight river (not\nat right angles) and that Weatherspoon's pig\nlives on the land in the acute angle between the\ntwo.\nLast week Weatherspoon was able to buy a piece of land on the other side of the path. It's triangular in shape, with the path and the river\n(forming an obtuse angle) as two of its sides,\nand a long fence as the third side. But it's a little large for Weatherspoon to cultivate on his\nown, so he's planning to divide it into smaller\nplots which he will share out among his friends.\nOf course, it isn't that simple. Firstly,\nWeatherspoon insists that each plot must be\ntriangular. And secondly, he objects to what\nhe calls 'long thin triangles'. He says they're\n\"all fence and no grass\". So I 've offered to\nshow him how to divide his field up into\ntriangular plots in such a way that no plot has\nan angle greater than or equal to a right angle.\nBut I hope Weatherspoon realises he will be\nsharing his land with at least\u2014how many\nothers?

    "content": "Sir\nFrom your treatment of Mr Barney McCabe on the cover\nof FELIX603 it is quite obvious that you regard the\nwearing oi' ladies apparel by\nmen as a bit of a joke.\nHowever, as the owner of\nthe dress which Mr McCabe was wearing I was somewhat\nshocked to see your front\ncover. The\" blue chiffon\" dress was, in fact, a treasured\nitem of clothing which went\nmissing from the Beit laundry\nseveral weeks ago.\nPresumably the Deputy President is also in possession\nof my black silk underwear\nand seamed stockings. I would be grateful if he would\nreturn them immediately.\nTours\nP. Creighton-Ward\nDear Sir\nWith reference to N. Lam brou s Soapbox ( FELIX603) in particular, and the attitude\nof people in office of any kind\nin general I would like to take\nexception to the vastly over-used cop out of ' student apathy'. During my time at\nCollege, like N. Lambrou, I too have formed opinions of\nthe student body. However,\nalthough at this time last year\nI too thought our students to\nbe an apathetic bunch, I have\nsince changed my mind.\nIt is very easy to fall into the\ntrap of thinking \" I organised\nthis wonderful event for them,\nbut they were too apathetic to\nturn up. It's not my fault.\" But\nthis is in my opinion totally the\nwrong attitude. The reason\nwhy people don't go to an\nevent is because they don't think they will enjoy it\nenough, or because they have\nnot noticed that it is happen-ing. The fault for this rests\nsolely with the organisers.\nYou could organise a public\nhanging of Tony Benn and\nMargaret Thatcher in Beit\nQuad, but if you don't publicise it well, enthuse\nabout it to those around you,\nand go out of your way to\nencourage attendance, people\ncould well not notice the\nevent.\nI was totally unaware of M r'E.C. Anyaoku's lecture taking\nplace, who he is, or exactly\nwhat he was talking about.\nDue to the dreary and uninspiring nature of the last\nweek's Soapbox, I'm still unsure.\nIf people organising events\nare not prepared to get off\ntheir fat backsides and put\nsome life into their projects\nwhy should anyone else? I am\nquite willing to admit that\nany lack of interest in my\nevents is totally my fault.\nWhy is no-one else honest\nenough to do the same?\nTours apathetically\nPhil Greenstreet\nRC SUV P Dear Sir\nThank you for publishing\nN. Lambrou's Soapbox article\nlast week! I found it very\nconvincing and revealing. In\nmy four months at Imperial,\nI 've realised how simple minded the average IC student is In fact I wonder\nhow many even read the\nSoapbox article, beyond the\nfirst paragraph!\nAre the scientific and engineering courses so dem and ing that there is not\ntime to question \" ideals\", \"purposes\", \"ambition\"? Or is it that real ale, space-invaders and heavy rock are\nmore important than knowing\nabout Third World countries?\nIt would be interesting to\nsurvey how many know what\nhappened in Cyprus in 1974?\nHow it happened? Who suffered? And what is the\nsituation now? Hopefully the\nnew Cyprus Society, this\nterm, will organise events to\nanswer these questions but\nwill there be an v listeners?\nP. Z.(D. S.E.S.) Dear Sir\nN. Lamb rou's article in\nSoapbox last week highlights\na continuing headache for\nclubs organising meetings\nwith outside speakers. OS C's lecture on 'New Nations' was\ncompeting for audiences with\nthree other meetings.\nThe problem is clubs have\nno way of knowing what other\nmeetings have already been\narranged for a particular day\nwhen inviting speakers. A simple solution, surely, would\nbe to keep a diary in the\nUnion Office in which clubs\ncould record details of meetings that they had arranged.\nThis could then be consulted\nby anyone who wanted to\nknow whether a particular\nday would still be suitable for\ninviting a speaker.\nTours faithfully\nJ.P. Stanley\nBE3\nDear Sir\nIt is with interest and great\ndismay that I have read the\narticle of Frank James and the\nletters of Mr Lyall and Mr Mercer. I would like to\napologise to Frank for the lack\nof precision of both Mr Mercer and Mr Lyall's views.\nFor the last two weeks I have\nwritten a letter for each\nFELIX and yet not forwarded\nthem. Now, I cannot remain\nsilent.\nTo say that I am a Christian\nneeds clarifying for both Mr Mercer and Mr Lyall have\nsaid that they are Christians. I believe that every word from\nGenesis to Revelation is Gods\ninspired word. I believe in a six day creation and have yet\nto find one scientific fact\nwhich can say to me \"Look,\nhere is evidence that demands\nevolution and forbids crea-tion\". I challenge anybody\nwho reads this letter. May I point a few things out.\n1. The order of creation is\nnot the order of evolution.\nThe sun was created after\nplanets to state on biblical\nfact.\n2. Genesis 1 and Genesis 2\ndo not contradict. In Genesis\n1 God says \" This is the order I created heaven and earth. In\nchap 2 God reveals a little\nmore, some of the detail, of\nhow He created the world.\n(Be careful with the Hebrew\ntenses.)\n3. The word for 'day' in\nGen 1 can be translated age.\nBut Exodus 2 0 v8 ll points\nout that the Creation was\naccomplished in six twenty\nl our days. May I finally leave\na word of advice to the critics\nof Gen 1 and 2. If you don't believe it don't try and mock\nor refute it; you deceive\nyourself. If you don't believe\nit, leave it alone.\nTo Mr Mercer and Mr Lyall; if you don't believe the\nfirst two chapters of Genesis as\nGods inspired word, you might as well throw the whole\nbook away as unreliable and\nrely on evolution lor salva-tion.\nTours sincerely\nJohn Davies\nChemistry 1\nSix\nWe in the Islamic Soc\nwould like to correct the\nerroneous assumptions made\nby Messrs James and Lyall in\ntheir letters to you in last\nweek's FELIX. These misinterpretations were made\nboth with regard to the\nobjectives and contents of our\narticle.\nFirstly our article was not\nin response to Mr James'. Our intention was to try to show in\na necessarily generalized way,\nthat in submission to the Will of God\u2014-i.e. Islam\u2014both faith\nand reason are united.\nSince the age of enlightenment in the West, when\neverything began to be red u ced to manmade laws\nthrough scientific method ology, faith in the unseen has\nbeen socially debased. Sociol ogi sts have shown that religion is at best illogical and\nat worst a cruel con trick; \"the\nopium of the poor\".\nAlthough some, like Mr Lyall, can honestly say that\nthe advance of science has not\naffected his belief in a Creator,\nnevertheless it cannot be\ndenied that generally, belief\nin a supreme being and therefore wor h sip of Him has\nbeen pushed away from the\ncentre of the stage in Western\nsociety. Materialistic concerns\nhave become the objects of\nreason, and the worship of\nGod has become less than a secondary concern.\nNow if we, in our article,\nhad merely printed all the\nContinued on page 4.\nPage 2 FELIX, February 5, 1982\n\n"

In a light force 7 the team generously\noffered to test UE A's boats to destruction.\nIn the first race the team got off to a good\nstart but this could not last for long. Bennett\nand Dalton were rammed on the first beat in\na vicious (illegal) manoeuvre by the opp osi tion. This was followed by a dastardly move\n(also illegal) against Mills and Redman which\nresulted in their subsequent capsize, they\nthen proceeded to dredge the channel for\ntwenty minutes.

Thanks lo Chris Jones for umpiring.\nMixed\nThe usual Sunday morning enthusiasm for\nhockey was immediately apparent during the\nwarm-up, but once the effects of Saturday\nnight had been run off, the team settled down\nto play its usual attractive, crowd-pulling\nhockey. Unfortunately, after about twenty\nminutes the inevitable happened when Tim Coatesworth, despite being relegated to a defensive position, managed to poach yet\nanother goal from the forward line by scoring\nfrom a shor corner.\nSoon alter our persistence paid off and\nhistory was made when a cross by Andy Stroomer was converted by Alison Wall. This\nwas our first \"non-Coatesworth\" goal of the\nseas,in. UC seemed confused by all of this and\nfor some obscure reason decided to attempt\nthe systematic removal of Andy Stroomer's fingers!\nDespite the openness of our defence at\ntimes, UC never managed to find that extra\nbit of penetration with Tim, Ruth and Steve\ncoping admirably. Goalkeeper Chris Jones\nmanaged to throw whatever part of his\nanatomy was available at the time at the ball\nand was only beaten late in the game by a well-taken 'volley'. Fine work down the left\nby Chris, Ruth and Alison produced a set of\nchances nearly converted by Jo and Karen. The unbeaten run continues and we look\nforward to next week when an attempt will\nbe made to keep Gray off the \"teas\"!\nTeam: Chris, Ruth, Chris, Steve (Capt),\nCoathanger, Simon, Jo, Karen, Alison, Andy.\nFELIX, February 5, 1982 Page 9\n\n"

Without\ncondition both speakers supported C ND's premises and arguments for\nnuclear disarmament. However, Lord Carver raised doubts about C ND's' proposed process of disarmament. The lectures were both attended by\nupwards of 200 people', a trend hopefully repeated with the third last\nTuesday. The last lecture of the series takes the form of a debate\nbetween ProfessonMichael Pentz and Lord Chalfont. This promises to\nbe a heavyweight tussle between two accomplished speakers, and it is\nimportant that both sides (especially C ND's) are adequately represented\nin the audience. Furthermore, please note that a veteran disarm er, Lord\nZuckerman, will present the sixth Jubilee Lecture entitled 'Nuclear\nIllusion and Reality'.

Until relatively recently few people ever left the security of their\nown town or village and the thought of venturing overseas never entered\ntheir heads. This was at a time when it would take months, even years of\nuncomfortable travel to reach your destination.\nIt took manifest destiny, toil, sweat and great hardship for the\nAmerican people to traverse their continent in a century. Wow all it takes\nis $140 and a Greyhound bus to take you to Los Angeles in a day or so.\nThis century has seen newer and faster forms of transportation. Roads\nand motorways have meandered their way through most parts of the\nwestern world, with their tributaries running past everyone's doorstep.\nAirplanes particularly have seen the time for journeys that would have\ntaken months melt away to mere hours.\nIn an age when we can travel through the air faster than the speed of\nsound, when we can get out of bed in London to make it in time for tea in\nNew York, what does the future of transportation hold for us?\nIf you want to find out, come along to this Monday's lecture by R.M.

Aliens attempt to\nprevent mankind from destroying\neverything with a new form of\nenergy they are about to discover\nby resurrecting bodies with their\namazing rays from their flying\nsaucer. It stars Bela Lugosi and\nCriswell (who?) and must be seen\nto be disbelieved. The last time I saw it was at 3 o 'clock in the\nmorning. It took me weeks to\nrecover.\nWe challenge you to see both\nfilms in one programme, but be\nwarned, the result could be a permanent personality change, so\ntry not to turn up under the\ninfluence of anything or your\ndoo bries could remain severely\nboggled.

For those of you who woke up long enough to drag\nyourself to the debate, thank you for your support.\nWe are planning further debates this term, including, hopefully, a Nuclear Weapons debate, and, possibly, a South Africa\u2014Apartheid\ndebate. Almost certainly there will be a debate on the superiority of the\nmale sex (no contest really), which will be held in a place with ready\nrefreshments, and debated by members of the society.\nWhich brings me to the next, and most important point: membership.\nAt present we have only the five committee members: Der mot McCauley, Maths 3; Chris Lee, Maths 3; Steve Turner, Physics 1; Steve\nParr, Physics 1; Steve Chamberlain, Physics 1.\nAs well as the superiority debate, I have a few other ideas, but these\ncan only be implemented if we have some mem be s. Cards are now\navailable, and the fee will be 50p( contact one of the above five).\nJoin the society now, and we can have plenty of serious, half-serious\nand lunatic debates; delay too long, and the society will fold up as it has\ndone in the past; and this would be a sad end to a valiant effort to bring\ninformative entertainment to IC.\nSteve Turner\nPublicity Officer\nPS: Sorry for the solemn report.

Thus we showed both\nreason; represented in the corr all aries between what\nscientific theory and the Quran( Gods last ve v elation to Man) says about creation\nand faith in God are united in\nthe religion of Islam.\nIt is in this context, alone,\nthat we quoted the Quran ic passages concerning creation\nand not as Mr James misc he vio us ly assumed.

Each prophet\nfrom Adam through to Abraham, Lot, Joseph, Moses, Jesus and Prophet Mo ham med came to teach his particular people how to worship\nthe One God \u2014 although the\nlast prophet had a mission to\nthe whole of mankind. But\nalways, the prophets brought\nthe same universal message of\nIslam; submission to the will\nof one God alone.

Accommodation\nfor next year\nThe time has come to start thinking seriously\nabout whether you want to apply to live in\nCollege accommodation next year and about\nwhat type of accommodation you want to go\nfor.\nApplication forms will be available from\nStudent Services on Monday, February 15.\nThe closing date for applications is Friday,\nMarch 12. On Friday, February 12, FELIX will\ncarry an illustrated supplement giving full\ndetails of available accommodation and how\nto apply for it.\nWhile you are waiting for the FELIX\nsupplement, here are a few thoughts to keep\nyou going.\nHa//s and Houses\nFor the purpose of applications to Halls and\nHouses, you will be considered either as a re-applicant if you have lived in a Hall or House\nbefore or a new applicant if you haven't. People who have lived in Residence before\ncan only be considered as new-applicants if:\na) They lived in Residence as an undergraduate and will be a postgraduate next\nsession.\nb) They have only lived in Residence during\nthe second half session i.e. they moved in\nafter the beginning of the spring term.\nThird Year New Applicants\nIt is anticipated that all third year new\napplicants will be successful in obtaining\nplace in Residence, in single room accommodation. This is by no means a guarantee since\nwe may have an unexpectedly high demand.\nNevertheless, there is a good chance that we\nwill be able to house everybody in this\ncategory.\nSecond Year New Applicants\nBecause of the priority given to third years,\nsecond year new applicants stand less of a chance of getting in and, if they do, there is a high probability that they will be offered\nshared rooms.\nRe-app llc ants These are selected by a sub-committee of\neach Hall and House Committee whose\nmembers have not applied for a further year\nin Residence.\nPostgraduates\nPostgraduate re-applicants are treated in the\nsame way as other re-applicants. Applications\nfrom postgraduate new applicants are\nconsidered by the Postgraduate Admissions\nTutors in the Departments. The closing date\nfor these applications is Friday, July 16.\nHead Tenancies and College Flats\nPresent Head Tenancies include:\nHamlet Gdns, Hammersmith: flats for 3, 4, 6, 7\nand 8.\nCambridge Gdns, Notting Hill: a flat for 4 and\none for 6.\nLexham Gdns, Kensington: flats for 3, 4, 5, 6,\nand 8, also double flat lets and single beds its. Earls Court Square, Earls Court: single and\ndouble rooms.\nSinclair Gardnes, Shepherds Bush: flats for 5\nand 8.\nGerrard Mansions, Soho: flats for 2.\nThe College flats which will be available are\ntwo Southside penthouse flats and one mews\nflat behind Southside\u2014all flats suitable for 4\npeople.\nYou can make one application for Residence and one for the Head Tenancies and\nflats, if the latter application is successful,\nyour application for Residence will be\nwithdrawn.\nIf you are applying for the Head Tenancies\nand flats, then except in the case of single\nrooms and beds its, you will need to apply\nwith one or more others. You will only be\nconsidered for accommodation suitable for\nthe size of group in which you apply.\nI hope this has started you thinking about\nnext year. Look out for next week's FELIX and\nthe illustrated supplement (we should have\nsome extra copies of the supplement at\nStudent Services if you miss the FELIX). If\nyou have any queries in the meantime, don't hesitate to contact us.\nMichael Arthur\nStudent Services\n15 Princes Gdns\nPage 4 FELIX, February 5, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nJAMES DEENY GOES SW\nTheft in Lexham\nGardens\nA thief ransacked three rooms in the basement of 48 Lexham\nGardens, a College head tenancy, last Friday. A large carving\nknife which was removed from one flat and found in another, may\nhave been used to force the other doors or even as a potential\nweapon.\nTwo of the rooms (occupied by Mr J. Martin Taylor, ICU External\nAffairs Officer, and Mr Tom Owen, RCS Academic Affairs Officer)\nwere unwisely left with only a small Yale top lock to secure them, the\nstronger Chubb bottom locks being left off. These doors were easily\nforced and access to a third room was gained via a window. The thief\nquickly looked through the contents of the rooms and took money from\nelectricity meters as well as any loose change that was lying around.\nResidents returned to the basement soon after midday Friday and\ndiscovered the three open doors. A fourth room which had been\nsecurely locked was undisturbed. The police were notified and in the\nevening detectives looked for finger prints and took short statements.\nThe thief has not yet been apprehended and residents are advised to\ndouble lock their doors whenever they leave the premises.\nRCSU Bolt\nWith Spanner\nAT APPROXIMATELY1:45 pm yesterday a team of 20 R CSU students successful y violated Spanner and Bolt, the mascots of City and\nGuilds College Union.\nA raid was carefully planned, cent ring on yesterday's Guilds U GM. The plan suffered numerous setbacks but eventually succeeded owing\nto the initiative of the team members.\nThe house where the two mascots were kept was located and two\nR CSU members approached the door in the guise of Council\nworkmen. By some means they managed to gain access and, with a further group following them, kidnapped both mascots.\nSpanner and Bolt were taken away to a secret destination,\nsomewhere in the UK. It was revealed earlier this\nScottish first year physicist,\nWednesday afternoon.\nHis action was prompted by\nfinding his long lost swimming\ntrunks amongst his home beer-making kit last Saturday.\nMr Deeny was reported to\nhave said that although the water\nwas a little cold he found the\nexercise both refreshing and\ninvigorating.

    "content": "Kinnock on Cuts\nNeil Kinnock Ml', the Shadow Education Secretary, attracted a sizeable audience on Tuesday when he discussed the Labour Party's alternative lo education cuts. His speech firstly reviewed the current\nsituation, and then indicated Labour's plans.\nThe Current Situation\nMiKi imo ek staled that, in human terms, the Conservative government lias already excluded .many thousands of people from\nhigh ei education. This is compounded financially, in that redundancy\npayments of stall will probably outweigh the savings achieved. The result is that education cuts are \"even more destructive than even the\ngovernment intended.\" The danger is that the cuts, aimed primarily at\narts courses, will undermine the structure of most universities. A probable consequence, he said, would be the creation of o vcrs pee i aliso d\" mono technic s\". Sir Keith Joseph would naturally like\nto see such establishments full of students \" with short hair, shiny shoes\nand living at home on student loans\".\nThe Labour Alternative\nMr Kinnock stated Labour's education policy to be expansion and change. Labour would restore higher education financially, but would\nexpect universities to argue their case more effectively. In .particular,\nthe animosity between colleges and the general public must be healed.\nHe said that university admissions procedures need to be changed, so\nthat they are preoccupied with accepting, and not rejecting, prospective students. For this, more introductory courses and more\nmodular courses should be started. Moreover, a selection criterion\nwould be which candidates could best take advantage of higher\neducation.\nOn overseas students, Mr Kinnock rejected the current policy of\nimposing full-cost fees. The Labour Party resents what he termed the\ngovernment's \"chauvinist prejudice\", as it results in the sole criterion\nfor selection being money. He advocated that overseas students be\nrecommended for a place purely on ability. A proportion of overseas\ndevelopment spending, funded by North Sea oil, would sponsor those\nstudents who can't afford the lees.\nAfter the meeting. L'n ion President Nick Morton talked to Mr Kinnock. The President will, if all goes well, arrange an appointment\nto discuss IC.'s case with the Shadow Education Secretary.\nMaggie's Money Man\nCourts Cortazzi's Consoc\nNew Handbook.

Chief Financial Secretary to the Treasury and a member of the\nCabinet, spoke in College yesterday at the invitation of the\nConservative Society. Head dressed a well attended meeting\non the subject of the Government's economic policy.\nHe outlined the background ol\nune om petit ive ness against which\nthe present situation must be set.\nThe government is, he said, improving the situation by acting\nto reduce inflation which has\nhalved since the government took\noffice. The rise in unemployment\nis very unfortunate, but is a consequence ol over manning and\nthe only long-term solution is the\ncontrol of inflation. Orders to\nindustry are already increasing,\nas is productivity, and soon a fall\nin unemployment will result, he\nclaimed.\nHe predicted that by the time\nof the next General Election the\ngovernment will be able to show\nthat inflation is under control,\nthat unemployment is falling,\nand that British industry, resorting to competitiveness, is\nprospering again.\nPublic spending is being cut as\nfar as possible to reduce the burden of taxes and interest rates\non industry. However he thought\nthat much is being done, at great\nexpense, to mitigate the worst\neffects of unemployment, for example the new Youth Training Scheme.\nAfterwards Mr Brittan answered several questions from the\naudience about the government's economic policy. He is the second\nCabinet member to visit College\nthis session and two more, Norman Tebbit and Sir Keith Joseph, are expected next term,\nall at the invitation of the Conservative Society.\nJez, Jack\nand Jiil\nLast Monday the popular BBC television programme for children, Blue Peler, played host to\nJezebel, the motorised mascot of\nthe Royal College of Science.\nViewers were given a quick\nhistory of the 1916 fire engine\nand told how her 400 gallons per\nminute pumping capability could be used in the mopping-up\noperation after any future London flood.\nMr Dave Thompson, attired in the R CSU Presidential cloak and\nhat, assumed most of the vocal\nduties and presented a large birthday card to Jack and Jill, the Blue Peter cats, on behalf of\nthe R CSU.

    "content": ".\u2014y/ iM&/2j lfT0' nw nic nne clearly hears or chest The Hypochondriac by Moliere. Translated by Alan Drury. Directed by Michael\nBogdanov. The Olivier, National Theatre.\n\"Oh, the powers of nature! She knows what\nwe need, and the doctors know nothing.\"\nBenvenuto Cellini, Autobiograpy (1558-66)\n\"Doctors cut, turn, and torture the sick, and\nthen demand of them an undeserved fee for\nsuch services.\"\nHeraclitus (c500BC) Moliere would doubtlessly have nodded with\nmocked approval at these words. He was\nobsessed with illness, medicines and doctors\nall his life, and no less than six of his plays are\ncomic but biting attacks on the medical\nprofession.\nThe incomparable Daniel Massey plays the\ntotally self-absorbed hypochondriac, Argan, in\nMoliere's play Le Malade Imaginaire, otherwise\nknown as The Hypochondriac. Argan draws\ncomfort in his pitiful life from only two sources:\nhis loving wife and enemas (liquid medicines\ninjected into the rectum). In between hurried\nshuffles to the toilet catalysed by ingesting his\nbeloved medicines he tries to marry off his\ndaughter (played by Emily Morgan who also\nplays her very young sister in a truly comic and\nunforgettable way) to a doctor. With Michael\nBogdanov directing in his typically exuberant\nstyle, the result is a hilarious and delightful\nevening of buffoonery.\nThe Hypochondriac, like all Moliere's plays,\nis based on the Italian Commedia del VAr te,a form of rough, improvised theatre abounding\nin earthy humour and bursting with vitality. It\nis an art-form that is currently enjoying a great\npopular revival and it is one that 1 personally\nhave taken a great liking to. The National\nTheatre production retains these elements\nwhich materialise in the form of revels,\nmasques, street plays, acrobatic displays and\nsong and dance. The Commedia delF Arte consists of popular 'stock' characters and I was surprised to discover that Moliere took as\nhis model (he himself acted in his plays) the\ncharacter of Scaramouche who clownishly\npersonifies a cowardly braggart. Scaramouche!\nNow there's an interesting aside! Are we not\nforced to the inevitable conclusion that the\nFELIX puzzle-setter with his self-adopted pen-name Scaramouche, is no more than a self-confessed cowardly braggart, so cowardly he\nhas to conceal his identity under this\npseudonym?\nThe Hyprochondriac must be one of the\nmost enjoyable plays currently on stage in London. However, it is unfortunately coming to a close and its last four performances are on\nFebruary 15, 16 and 17 (matinee and evening). I am very tempted to go again\u2014something I very\nrarely do.\nNick Bedding\nGood by CP. Taylor directed by Howard\nDavies. The Royal Shakespeare Company\nat the Warehouse.\nThis is the first time I had been to The\nWarehouse and I was somewhat overawed (or\nperhaps the word should be 'under awed') by\nits interior, and coming in with only a few\nmoments to spare meant that I wasn't paying\nthe attention I should when the play began.\nThe small theatre occupies the loft of an old\nbuilding and the overall appearance is one of\nshabbiness and tempor ari ness, but it does\npossess a rather likeable intimacy. The\nWarehouse is the RSC' s experimental\nplatform, and such current successes as\nEducating Rita began life here.\nCP. Taylor, author of Good, unfortunately\ndied at a tragically early age only a few weeks\nback, just when his work was achieving\nnational recognition. Good is a mature and\nintelligent play about a 'good' man, a lecturer\nin German Literature, who gets caught up in\nthe maelstrom of the Third Reich and\neventually becomes its turning force. This\ncharacter, Haider, is played with commanding\npresence by Alan Howard, who has just won\nThe Standard Award for Best Actor for his\nperformance in the play. Haider unintentionally\nbecomes involved with the forerunner of the\nNazi party and although he vaguely perceives\nin the distance the injustices and horrors Nazi\npolicy is leading to, his immediate personal\nproblems are of more importance to him. His\nJewish friend tries to awaken him, but to no\navail. Haider suffers from a mental disturbance\nin which he clearly hears orchestral music in\nmoments of personal drama. This is a clever\ndevice employed by Taylor to add lighter\ntouches to the play, the actors bursting into\nsong now and again to the accompaniment of a trio, but I did feel slightly uneasy about this at\ntimes; the subject upon which the play is based\nis of the type that demands a finely tuned\nbalance between humour and drama. Unaware of the maelstrom inexorably pulling\nhim towards its centre, Haider is only\nconscious of the people and the problems\nimmediately around him.\nThe play is based on documentary material,\nincluding unpublished transcripts of interviews\nwith SS officers who played an important part\nin administering the Nazi concentration\ncamps. But above all the play is a work of\nimagination and of the present day; of people\nnot having the time, the foresight or inclination\nto appreciate where world events are leading\nand by their very inaction bring about the\narrival of horrendous situations which those\nworld events foreshadowed. Hitler said in\nconnection with the Jews \" the art of\nleadership....consists in consolidating the\nattention of the people against a single\nadversary and taking care that nothing will\nsplit up that attention.\" This 'art of leadership'\nis again being practised today, but this time\nacross the Atlantic\nGood has been a sell-out success since it\nopened last September but discussions are\nunderway about a possible further London life\nfor the production at the end of the\nWarehouse session in March, followed by a season in Broadway.\nNick Bedding\nThe Battle for the Labour Party by David\nand Maurice Kogan, Fontana, \u00a31.75, 151\npages.\nThis book is about the activities of the left\nwing groups in the Labour Party. It takes a fairly objective approach, it's not the sort of\nbook Denis Healey might write, but it's clearly\nsympathetic to the right of the Labour Party, it\nconcentrates on what's happened between\n1979 and the end of 1981, with a little\nbackground material about dissent in the\nLabour Party since 1900. The organisations\ndescribed in the most details are the Campaign\nfor Labour Party Democracy (which pressed\nfor the constitutional reforms) and later the\nRank and File Mobilising Committee (which\nsupported Tony Benn's election campaign.\nThe RFMC recently appears to have been\nsuperseded by 'Labour Liason '82').\nIf you think that that paragraph was boring\nthen you aren't going to like the book, which is\nwritten like a textbook. It's a pity about the\nstyle because the subject matter is important,\nso long as there's still a chance of Labour\nforming a future government. The book makes\nit clear that the left are much better organised\nand more intelligent in the way they per sue their aims than the right wing of the party. But\nyou can see this already from the big changes\nthe leftist groups have accomplished in the last\nfew years (compulsory re selection, the\nelectoral college, the SDP). More interesting\nare the descriptions of exactly hou; the\nactivists go about getting support for their\naims. They depend on the fact that local\nparties are always controlled in practice by a small number of people who bother to turn up\nto meetings and stand for committees (just like\nICU). \"The CL PD bombarded every constituency with campaigning material which\nincluded the standard resolutions to be\nproposed at that year's conference.\" So at a conference, forty or fifty constituency parties\nmight all propose the same resolution (skillfully\ndrafted for them by the CLPD) giving the\nimpression of enormous popular pressure for\nconstitutional change. There's nothing\nunderhand about such tactics of course, and\nthe book emphasises that the left are generally\ncareful to follow constitutional methods.\nThe book also deals with the deputy\nleadership campaigns, involving the Rank and\nFile Mobilising Committee (partly Trotskyist,\nthe Kogans say) and its backing for Tony\nBenn. Then there's fourteen pages or so about\nKen Livinstone and the GLC, then the last\nchapter which is a mildly pretentious and\nboring discussion of the 'theoretical' basis for\nthe left's campaigns. The authors are better at\nreporting and describing events than they are\nat getting at the reasons why they happen and\nthe post cri pt, added a few months after the\nmain text was finished, is one of the most\ninteresting parts of the book. They recount\nhow the parliamentary party is becoming more\nleft wing: \"Of 25 MPs retiring, 17 had voted for\nHealey and were replaced by candidates of the\noutside or inside left.\" It looks like a race\nbetween the activists and the SDP to se who\ncan finish off the Labour Party first. On the\nwhole, 'The Battle for the Labour Party' is a reasonably interesting but not very well written\nbook.\nN. Willson\nFELIX, February 5, 1982 Page 7\n\n"
