He thus made a proclamation.\" I am a dictator, hut I am a benign\ndictator and I want to know what\nyou think about the regime. Please\nwrite to me and tell me.\nBy order,\nThe Dictator.\"\nNow the people did write to him, but so\nmany of them wrote that he didn't even\nbother to read the letters and decided\nthat he would stop being a friendly dictator and dictate a little, because it was\nobvious that the plebs didn't know what\nthey wanted and he knew much better.\nAnd HE lived happily ever after\".\nI am not a dictator, but I will read every\nletter and take note of what you want\n\u2014 and we might even get something\ndone about it.\nAnd until then, I remain\nMartin C. Black Getting Clean \u2014\nMinded Most people at IC will have at least\nheard the name TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION. The name by itself is\nmisleading, conjuring up images of\nEastern mysticism.\nT.M. is simply a mental technique for\ninducing a state of consciousness in\nwhich the body enters an extremely profound rest state while the mind remains\nalert (R.F. Scientific American, Feb.,\n1972). This has a wide range of effects,\nfor example the complete removal of\nstress and tension from the nervous system (think about the implications of\nthat).\nIf taught properly, the technique is\neasily learnt, and a course is held at IC most weekends.

Swailes\nTHE STORY SO FAR: Having escaped from the fairground, and from floating\nin mid-air, by use of the partially-invisible gum boots, Phosphorous, together with\nFerocious and Twigworm, are trying to escape the clutches of the Luigi Rabbit organisation. They have just met the plane on the beach. Now read on . . .\nThe Luigi Rabbit Organisation was coming steadily nearer, waving its arms and shouting.\" At fu il the r problem,\" said Ferocious.\" Don't just stand there waffling,\" snapped the plane,\" get in and we can go. It is after all what I have been waiting for all this time.\"\" Smart thinking\", murmured Ferocious, as they clambered into the cockpit. For all the plane's size, the cockpit was not very large. It was quite a tight squeeze, and after a moment of panic when it appeared that the Twig worm was going to sit on both Ferocious and Phosphorous, they sorted themselves out \u2014 with Ferocious and Phosphorous sitting on the Twig worm.\" AH right?\" asked the plane and without waiting for a reply Started its engines. They coughed and spluttered into life and clouds of foul smelling black smoke spread over the s and.\" Just like the modern stuff,\" said Ferocious, topically. The whole framework of\nthe aircraft began to tremble and shake. An ominous rattle came from beneath the Twig worm's seat.\n\" Oh dear\", he moaned,\" I don't think I like this flying.\"\" Nonsense,\" grunted Ferocious unfeelingly. The Luigi Rabbit Organisation had nearly reached the plane \u2014 they could make out the Rabbit's Staring white rimmed eyes, and Dino's battered face \u2014 when the huge machine slowly turned, and began to move along the beach. S and whirled up in the roaring wind from the twin propellers, and as the plane gathered speed, the Luigi Rabbit Organisation dropped out of sight.\" I can't say I'm sorry to see the back of\nthose dear chaps,\" said Ferocious.\" Men either,\" said Phosphorous. While they were talking the plane had risen smoothly, if noisily, from the beach, and the palm trees were already tufted matchsticks beneath the m.\"U u u u ur gh!\" gulped the Twig worm as he inadvertently glanced over the side.\" Don't lookout there,\" said Ferocious helpfully,\" study the inside of the cockpit if the outside is worrying you.\" The Twig worm stared industriously around the inside of the cockpit. It was luxuriously padded in leather, with a huge steering wheel on a pole, sticking up between Phosphorous' legs.\n\" What' s this?\" asked that worthy, giving it a push. The plane plunged forward into a dive, throwing the three adventurers into an untidy heap.\" Idiots! Fools! Incompetents!\" bellowed the plane, as, with a singing of rigging, and a throbbing of engines, it pulled out of the dive.\" Don't touch anything,\" it shouted,\" Iam doing the flying in this aircraft, do you understand?\"\" Sorry\", said Phosphorous.\" All right\", said the plane,\" just watch it.\nI don't know what adventurers are coming to . . . .\" he grumbled on under the throaty roar of the engines. Ferocious had been thinking.\" Where, exactly, are we going, dear old airborne structure?\" he inquired.\" I have absolutely no idea,\" said the plane proudly.\" But you can't keep on flying around indefinitely, can you,\" protested Ferocious.\" Look\", said the plane,\" I 've had just about enough cheek from you. My instructions were to pick F.D in and P. the Job rot plus Tiny Twig worm off the beach, and fly around in an adventurous manner.\"\" What happens when we run out of petrol?\" asked Ferocious, casually.\" I would assume that we comedown, or land, as we say in the trade.\"\" Bu ewe are over these a.\"\"Um,\" pondered the plane,\" Perhaps you' ve got a point there. I must admit that thought had n't occurred to me.\" Ferocious was used to Phosphorous' brain, so he was not des-<\nper a it ely shocked.\" Perhaps it would be a good idea,\" he suggested,\" to look for somewhere to land?\"\" Perhaps you' re right,\" conceded the plane,\" I will keep an eye out.\" Hardly had he spoken than a small, black cloud appeared on the horizon. It moved slowly towards the travellers.\" Looks like rain\", said Phosphorous.\" Oh dear\", squeaked the Twig worm,\" and I 've left my umbrella behind.\"\" Hang on, dear lads,\" said Ferocious,\" I don't Ithink that' sara in cloud. It looks more like some jolly old birdies.\" As the cloud came nearer, they could see that Ferocious was right \u2014 it was a flock of birds.-Strange birds they were too \u2014 long scrawny necks; bulbous bodies, like bundles of dirty washing; and tiny wings flapping furiously to keep their grotesque forms in the a lr \u00ab\nTheir long furry legs dangled unhappily beneath them, and from their tiny pinheads protruded razor sharp stabbing bills, lined with spiky teeth.\" Yu ch!\" said Phosphorous.\" What on earth are those nasty things?'* asked Ferocious,\" and are they friendly?\"\" Those,\" said the plane with a note of terror in his tick over, are Greater Gnashing S craw ns, and they are never friendly.\"\" Oh,\" said Ferocious,\" shouldn't we do something?\"\" Well, if I just cruise on, and turn my engines off,\" said the plane\" then they might not notice us.\" Ferocious did not think this particularly likely, but he kept quiet. The plane cut its engines, and began t \u00ab\nglide, its complicated rigging singing in the slip stream. The S craw ns were nearly level with the adventurers, and seemed to be about to pass without noticing them, when the leader let out a screech.\" Hold it, mel add os, there'sa nice juicy plane as ' ud make a tasty snack.\"\" Ohno,\" screamed the plane,\" they' re airborne crocodiles, those things, they' ll tear the canvas off a fellow, and leave only the undercarriage.\"\" Well do something!\" shouted Ferocious. The approaching danger drove the plane into action. With a. splutter and a roar here started his engines, and began to dive steeply towards the sea. Zoom, throb. Down he plunged, the three passengers clutching frantically at the side of the cockpit. But the S craw ns were not to be put off so easily. Like a screaming black wedge they plummeted out of the sun in hot pursuit. In a matter of moments they were up with the plane, and snapping and tearing at its tail.\" Great!\" shouted the leader,\" It's a late'28 I think, probably Handle y Page, Eastern hangar. Very acceptable.\" With S craw ns chewing at its wingtips the plane tried to climb again, and outstrip the terrible birds. But to no avail; it had neither the power nor the height.\" Try and find somewhere to land,\" bellowed Ferocious, over the sk walking and smacking of beaks The Plane was not really in any state to\nmake rational decisions, but he b lipped his engines, and dropped even lower, until his wheels were practically touching the sea.\nPhosphorous and Ferocious were standing up in the cockpit swatting at the S craw ns, when the Twig worm let out a squeak.\" There!\" he shouted,\" look, an island.\" Sure an ough a tiny palm fringed atoll lay in their path.\" Land there, dear old hard pressed air person.\" The plane needed no encourage( continued on page5) "

ICU reiterates the principle of the full grant for all students this aim to be a comp li shed by the abolition of the means test. ICU recognises that the means test, like the discretionary award, is a penny pinching and discriminatory measure, and that its retention would make nonsense of any claim for immediate increase, since the80 percent of students who do not receive the full grant would only gain apart of the claim, unless they get the corresponding increase in parental contribution. In the interests of a united campaign, ICU pledges full backing to the immediate dem and s of theN US for1. An end to the discretionary award syst em which allows local authorities to\npay lower grants to many students, particularly those in FE colleges.2. An end to discrimination against married women students3. An interim grant increase of \u00a365 to cover the cost of inflation since1971.4. An annual grant review based on a student cost index. This union demands an immediate increase of \u00a3100 p.a.in the postgraduate grant, the restoration of the London allowance; and the NUS Executive to give these two points equal priority with the four points in clause B.IC U notes the rent strikes by nine student unions last term and those proposed by25 unions this term, and expresses its wholehearted solidarity with all unions on rent strike, whether against excessive rents or for higher grants as part of theN US campaign. It is to be understood that the rent strike is part of the grants campaign and not directed towards lowering hall fees in IC.I CU is aware of the implications of the freeze policy in respect of the declining value of the student grant and that any attempt by the government to\" freeze\" grants must be strenuously and vigorously opposed. ICU notes that the major activities of the\nGrants Campaign will coincide with the exp i ration of the first 90 days of the freeze,\nand that at this time a large number of dem and s for wage increases will be coming forward from the organised labour movement. ICU resolves on a two pronged campaign aiming1. to win public support, and in particular that of the organised working class, for our claim to demonstrate the united anger of 600,000 students at the deterioration in our living standards and thus make it politically very difficult for the government to reject our demands.2. To explain that the Government must take full responsibility for the financing of higher education \u2014 neither students nor workers are responsible for this. The Government and its backers must pay for their problems here and elsewhere, students will not pay with higher rents, nor workers with loss of jobs. ICU therefore mandates1. the executive not to accept as sufficient\nreason for ending local action an offer\nby local college authorities to reduce hall or catering fees.\n2. the President, Executive and Council to\norganise support for theN US grants campaign, in particular for the USK area activities the London demonstration on February21 st the National Day of Action on March14 th3. the President and Departmental Representatives to organise departmental meetings to discuss the grants campaign.4. this meeting to elect a committee to org anise arent strike. This committee also to investigate the possibilities of using the experience of other colleges of org an ising lightning refectory boycotts\nand to report back to the next U&M. The demands of the rent strike apart from the points which are part of theN US campaign to be:(i) \u00a3100 increase in the grant now; and a full grant for all who Study tied directly to any increase in the cost of\nliving.( ii) No cutback in cleaners' jobs( iii) No rent increases( iv) The DES must pay for all future Halls( continued frompage2) ment, and headed straight for their only hope of rescue. Over an idyllic lagoon he flew and plunged down on the beach. S and flew everywhere, and the plane crashed into the undergrowth. Bits of bush flew everywhere, tiny creatures fled from the careering plane as it skidded to a halt amongst a clump of stinging nettles. Fuel pump throbbing, and propel lor s still slowly turning, the plane was in no condition to talk.\" Won't the S craw ns land, and finish us off?\" asked Ferocious.\" No,\" gasped the plane,\" they can' tland, their legs are too long, they just fly around up there devouring in no cer it planes, and' never coming down.\"\" Thank goodness for that,\" said Phosphorous,\" they were n't very nice at all.\" Despite having escaped the dreaded S craw ns, the intrepid trio were still in trouble deep. They were marooned on an island, they knew not where, with no food and a broken aeroplane.\" Are you broken?\" asked Ferocious of their late transport.\" Not seriously,\" as were d the plane,\" a certain amount of canvas seems to be missing from my tail plane, and my undercarriage is at rifle bent, but otherwise I'm not so bad, thankyou.\" Ferocious looked thoughtful.\" But can you fly?\" he asked.\" If I can get out of these bushes \u2014 undoubtedly.\"\" Right, dear boy,\" said Ferocious,\" May I suggest that you do just that, and then we can be on our way.\" With much revving and churning, the plane extricated itself from the bushes, and positioned itself facing down the beach.\" O. KC it shouted,\" Chocks away, and all that.\" The rumble of the engines rose to\na whine, and the plane began to move slowly forward. Its speed increased and the wind played around the passengers' ears. The tail left the ground, and the whole craft began to rise. But the end of the beach was fast approaching.\" We're off!\" shouted Phosphorous, hopefully. They were not. With a squeal of\npassengers, the plane plo nk ed hack on to\nthe beach once more, and skidded to a halt in the dunes at the end of the beach.\" Um,\" said Ferocious,\" we appear not to\nhave made it, as it were.\"\" We' ve too much weight aboard,\" exp laine d the plane,\" for the length of beach.\"\" Well, we will just have to throw something out,\" said Ferocious. They peered around the inside of the cockpit for something to throw out. There was nothing that immediately caught the eye.\n\" There doesn't seem to be anything that we can throw out,\" said Phosphorous.\" Oh yes there it is\", said the plane, nastily.\" What?\" asked Phosphorous, before he noticed Ferocious looking pointedly at, the Twig worm.\" Oh,\" said the weighty creature,\" please don't throw me out, I wouldn't know what to do.\"\" You could hail a passing ship, or something,\" said Ferocious, unfeelingly.\" But I'm the Whole reason for your ad ve ture,\" protested the Twig worm.\" You can have too much of a good thing,\" said Ferocious.\" Oh Ferocious,\" implored Phosphorous,\" you can't leave the poor Twig r worm alone on this beach, and we are supposed to be\ntaking him back to his parents.\" Ferocious pondered for a minute.\" I suppose,d ear boy, that you are right. In which case we will all have to get out and le'tour friend here go without us.\"\" You' requite right, I'm sure,\" said the plane, whose one desire was to leave the island, and preferably the? d venture rs as\nwell.\" You just hop out,\" he continued,\" and I'll have another go. If T do get back, I 'll\nte!1\nthe adventure people where you are,\nand I'm sure they' ll send some help.\"\" I'll bet,\" muttered Ferocious, and they all climbed out. The plane swung round and shot off down the beach again. With a zoom and a bounce it left the ground, taki nga small tree with it, and just clearing the bushes. The huge machine turned and roared overhead, waggling its wings once,\nbefore heading out to sea.\" What do we do now?\" asked Phosphorous.\" Once again, dear lad,y our guess is as good as mine,\" came the reply. Ferocious stretched out in the sun to\nthink, and the Twig worm did its pile-of-putrescent rubber impression beside him. Meanwhile Phosphorous was wandering about alt the water's edge. Idly glancing out over the surf, he caught sight of something floating, about a mile off shore.\" Hey!\" he yelled,\" Look at that, Ferocious and Twig worm, what do you think it can be?\"\"At first glance, dear boy,\" drawled Ferocious,\" it would appear to be a floating council refuse tip, ho,h o.\" But the Twig worm had leapt to his feet.\n\" It's a Twig wor mery,\" he cried,\" oh, and it's My Twig wor mery. Stop it, please. Oh dear, it's going to go past. What are we to do. Oh, stop it, please.\" Tear swelled up in the Twig worm's soulful eyes, and great sobs shook its huge form. Ferocious was on his feet, and running down to the water.\" Shout and wave and such things,\" he told Phosphorous,\" We must make a fire to at-tract their attention.\" Phosphorous obligingly waved his arms in the air and shouted\" Help\" and\" Hello, Twig worms\" and even\" Good Afternoon\". Ferocious dashed backup the beach to make a fire. Suddenly a thought struck him. They had no matches.\" We can rub two sticks together,\" he thought. The more he thought about this idea, the less practical it seemed. However it was worth a try, so he gathered a handful of dry twigs from the edge of the jungle and rushed back to the water's edge. Phosphorous still bellowing at the slowly dep art ing Twig wor mery, and the Twig worm was crying quietly in a heap on the s and.\" Are they all asleep, or something?\" asked Ferocious angrily, and received no reply. He bundled his sticks into a fire shaped pile, and started industriously rubbing two of\nthe larger ones together. Very little happened, except that some of the bark came off the sticks, and Ferocious' arms began to ache.\" Baden Powell never had this trouble,\" he complained. It was no good. The Twig wor mery had slowly drifted past and disappeared behind the island.\" Dr at!\" said Ferocious. The Twig worm sobbed to itself.\n\" What do we do now?\" asked Phosphorous,\" Dear old chum\", said Ferocious through clenched teeth,\" If you say that just once more, I'll bang you one on the nose.\"\" Sorry\", said Phosphorous, stepping sharply back. Ferocious was losing some of his much prized cool.\" O.K.,\" he said,\" just watch it, that' s all.\" Phosphorous turned his attention to the Twig worm.\" Cheer up,\" he said,\" I'm sure we'll get\nyou back in the end.\"\"O h,I do hope so,\" sniffed the Twig worm,\" but to see them float away like that is awfully sad if ying.\" Ferocious had been thinking.\" Gentlemen,\" he said,\" the Twig wor mery went out of sight behind the island. It\nis just possible, if anyone was steering the thing, that they intended to Stop on the other side of the island. Therefore I propose that we abandon this beach, and head into the jungle \u2014 hoping to emerge on the other side where the Twig wor mery was last\nseen heading. Any questions?\" Phosphorous was sure that there were several holes in Ferocious' argument, but could not put his finger on them at that very moment.\" O.K.,\" he said,\" that sounds fine to me.\"\" Won't there be any fierce animals in the jungle?\" asked the Twig worm nervously.\" I wouldn't be at all surprised,\" said Ferocious,\" but you are about three times as big as an elephant so I don't see what you' ve got to worry about.\" Phosphorous thought that a world which included S craw ns amongst its fauna, might well have bigger and crosser animals than a Twig worm. He didn't like to mention it in Ferocious' present mood, and the Twig worm seemed satisfied, so he kept quiet.\" Good,\" said Ferocious,\" if we are aM\nagreed then let's go.\" The three brave exp lore rs walked up the beach, and into the looming jungle.

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX January 16,1973\nEDITORIAL\n\" Solidarity with the workers!\"\" Workers and students for the struggle!\"\" Workers and students against the State!\" These phrases, vogue expressions of'72 destined to become the clich es of'73, seem to ring in m years perpetually. I always expected it of theN US. Now it is becoming the dominant voice of I Caswell. Swept in with the wave of politics that crashed over IC at the end of1972, they are now glibly and confidently being used as the voice of IC students. I cannot believe that you, the students of this fine, traditionally super reactionary college sincerely subscribe to these emotions. The broad mass of students would be horrified at being dropped into the stagnant vat of\" the organised working class\", and justifiably so. Even the TUC wouldn't lump us with the workers: witness their refusal of membership to theN US. Students are, in general, educated people, and gentlemen: and educated people and gentlemen, in general, are proud of the foundations of bureaucracy on which this country is so successfully built: negotiation and compromise. One has to stretch one's imagination quite considerably to describe our\" elected\" representatives in the NUSa s\" gentlemen\", in the commonsense of the word, anyway. It is they who negotiate on our behalf with the government for such things as higher grants. But theN US Executive, and sufficient SUp residents around the country to twist the arm of NUS conferences, believe in the student worker concept. And they believe that, like militant trades unions, they should not be implicated in any decision made by this\" Wicked Tory Government\". So they won't even negotiate for higher grants. We are workers, not students, so we can' task for more. Action not words. Goon strike. Rent Strikes. And force the Government to lick our feet and give usa Goon, laugh \u2014 what else can you do? What does aRent Strike do? Make life uncomfortable for the universities. The universities are not popular with the Government( presumably since they won' top t to become polytechnics) \u2014 but they are negotiators. The whole idea is that the universities will negotiate for higher grants for us. Is it not much more likely, that they will negotiate better terms for themselves \u2014 like direct payment of hall fees? Getting someone else to negotiate for you is an easy way out: but it is dangerous. And, in your home, theN US is in danger of muffing it up. The sooner we per s aude our\" representatives\" that we are educated gentlemen, and not the\" organised working class\", and wish to deal as such, the better. It will be necessary if we are to get the grant increase we would like next year: there is little hope under the system we are at present lumbered with. You have dissociated yourselves from a rent strike in IC.I wonder what it will mean to theN US. Maybe they' ll bethinking that we are just the misinformed working class. So watch those\" representatives\" of yours \u2014 unless you really want Days of Action, not words( and figures, and bigger one s)on your grant cheques. Letters\nRent Strikes ;\nlosing public sympathy?\nSir,\nI write this letter as storm-clouds are gathering for\nThursday'sU. G.M. over the\n'rent-strike' issue, and in partial anticipation of the decision to be reached.\nFirstly, I agree that student grants have, once\nagain, become inadequate, especially to those people in\nflats, digs, etc. However, I think that the action of withholding hall and student-house fees would not achieve\nits purpose.\nPoint 1. In the \"campaign\"\naims, listed on the bump h sheet distributed to Hall\nresidents, is to \"win public\nsupport.\"\nThis will probably sound\n'old-hat', but to, once again,\nput up the 'revolutionary\nstudents' image, although it\nmight appeal to those of us\nwith more extreme views, will\ncertainly not \"win public sup-port\". We have only to remember the Stirling affair\nlast year, which cost the student cause thousands, to\nrealise that the same thing is\nlikely to occur if rents are\nwithheld. At the moment the\npublic are bored with student\ndemonstrations.\nAlthough the Union might\nconsider that they are not out\nto cause such strife, surely\nthey must realise that if they\ngot to work on the public\nrather than the authorities\nthey might produce better re-sul ts.I see no logical reason\nwhy the withholding of rents\nshould do anything towards\ngetting grants increased\u2014in\nfact quite the reverse. I hope\nthat I am proved incorrect for\nthe sake of next year's grant\nearners.\nYours, etc.,\nR.C. WOODWARD,\nChem. 3.\nA JOWITT\nCOLLECTION\n(again)\nSir \u2014 / wait with bated\nbreath for the final episode\nand presumably the end of\n\"Phosphorous the Jobrot and\nFerocious Din\".\nYours T.T.C.

Sir\u2014Likewise \"The Landsnapper Sneeze\".\nYours I.W. T.W., PAUL JOWITT.\nI will not stop the\" Sneeze\". What does\" I.W. T.W.\" mean? \u2014 Ed. Sir\u2014Up.\nYours,\nPAUL JOWITT\nA reference to beef prices? \u2014 Ed. Cutting\nthe\ncleaners\nSir,\nI agree wholeheartedly\nwith Tim Bradbury's remarks\nin last week's edition of\nFelix. After all, we already\nhave a million unemployed:\na few more on the scrap heap would not really be noticed,\nwould it? Also, since a great\nnumber of the women involved are widows or have sick\nhusbands to keep, let us\nfollow the trend of this present heartless society, Tim,\nthe most needy must be the\nfirst to go. What I would also\nsuggest is that if you are\nprepared to clean your own\nroom, why not also maintain\nthe buildings, deliver your\nown mail, keep the sports\ncentre clean, cook your own\nmeals, and serve your own\ndrinks. Just think, this would\nreduce the staff by several\nhundreds. Who knows? Such\nreductions might not only\nkeep the halls fees stable but\nmay even reduce them.\nTherefore, Tim, why don't the\nStudents' Union and the\ntrade unions in I.C. get together on this. Who knows,\nperhaps one day you will\nbecome a Tory M.P. and even\nbe knighted for services to\nthe country.\nYours sincerely,\nRON PARKER\n(Be it Hall Messenger and\nSometimes N. U.P. E.

BUT IT'S A CLOSE THING\nUGM rejects Rent Strike\nNew Halls levy to continue\nMilitant students at Friday'sU GM erupted in uproar when the meeting narrowly\nthrew out the idea of a rent strike in TC in aid\nof the grants campaign.\nAbout 350 students turned up to vote at\nthe meeting, fifty less than attended Thursday's meeting which had to be adjourned to\nFriday.\nStarting twelve minutes\nlate because of the late arrival of the ICU Executive\nand general d is organ is a tion in the Great Hall, Thursday's meeting really\ngot under way With Mike Terry, National Secretary\nof the National Union of\nStudents, speaking on rent\nstrikes and the grants\ncampaign and answering\nquestions from the floor\nabout them. He told the\nmeeting that using the\nrent strike weapon: \"the\nonly economic power we\nhave\": was the best way\nof forcing the government\nto pay students higher\ngrants.\nStrong concern for postgraduate students was expressed in the questions\nput to Mr. Terry, mainly\nfocused on the opinion\nthat the campaign seemed\nto concentrate solely on\nincreasing undergraduate\ngrants. Mr. Terry said\nthat this opinion was fall-a cio us, and that the campaign was for an increase\nfor all students. (Our political correspondent, how-ever, points out that it is\nsignificant that little if any\nmention of postgraduates\nwas made at either the\nNUS conference at Mar gate last November or at\nthe Campaign Co-ordinating Committee's first\nmeeting in December). An amendment to the motion,\npassed by an overwhelming majority, called for an\nimmediate \u00a3100 increase\nin the postgraduate grant\nand the restoration of the\nLondon weighting, and\ndemanded that the NUS executive should give\nthese points equal priority\nwith the other objectives\nof the campaign.\nDori Schmetterling then\nspoke against the part of\nthe motion which would\nhave abolished the 35p per week new halls levy.\nPaul Jowitt, Deputy President, told the meeting that\nhe was sure that future\ngenerations of students\nwould look back in gratitude to the meeting and think that \"Tin 1973 ICU acted to get its students a higher grant, yet banished\nthem to live in Wimbledon\". It was further\npointed out that were it\nnot for the existence of\nthe levy it would be im possible to finance the\nbuilding of the new\nNorth side Hall. The paragraph of the\nmotion calling for the abolition of the levy was\nforthwith removed from\nthe motion by an amendment that was passed\noverwhelmingly.\nThe meeting then\nmoved on to consider amendments to the motion.\nTo save time the pre si dent, John Lane, who proposed the substantive\nmotion, accepted large\nparts of these; but considerable time was spent on\nthe others because Of protracted speeches from\nPiers Corbyn and Pete\nGillett.\nSo long, in fact, that the\nmeeting had to be adjourned at 2.25 until Fri day.\nGaining in inefficiency,\nthis meeting started a quarter-of-an-hour late at\n1.00, but, fortunately for\nthe quorum, few left for\nlectures at 1.30. The withdrawal of a motion by\nDave Brown recognising\n\"that a rent strike in Imperial College would not\nachieve any useful purpose and only aggravate\npublic opinion\" in favour\nof his speaking against the\nsubstantive, and the rapid\ndefeat of a Pete Gillett\namendment, meant that\nconsiderable discussion\n(by ICU GM standards)\non the substantive was\npossible. Major speeches\nin favour came from John.\nLane, John Murlis, Rob Armitage and Sonia Uochfelder; speeches against came from Bill Gerrard, Ron Marples and\nDave Brown.\nThe motion was voted\non in parts (all 14 of\nthem) and the majority of\nit, pledging the backing of\nICU to the demands of\nthe NUS for higher grants\nand a new grants structure was passed over-w helm ingly. The decisive moment\ncame when section F2 was\narrived at: \" ICU resolves\nto use the only economic\npower we have, the ability\nto withhold house and hall rents, to force the college authorities to put intense pressure on the Government to concede our claim.\" On the count, the vote\nwas:\nIN FAVOUR166 AGAINST 1 7 5\nABSTENTIONS 13\n\u2014 very close. The other\nsection of the motion referring to rent strikes was\ndefeated much more sub-st anti ally. However, a call to form\na rent strike organisation\ncommittee was passed \u2014\nthis committee will now\nco-ordinate the grants\ncampaign in IC. Following the vote, a militant faction headed by\nPiers Corbyn issued a petition for an EG M to be\nheld on Thursday, the\n1.8th. The text of the\nstatement is reproduced\nin the box on this page.\nThe Petition\nCALL FOR AN EMERGENCY GENERAL MEETING\" Thursday's550 strong U GM voted for an amendment which said:\" The demands of the\nrent strike apart from the points which are part of the NUS campaign to be: i...,ii..., iii . . . , iv . . .\nThis amendment \u2014 carried after a debate and vote by a substantial majority \u2014 assumes\nthere is to be a rent strike.\nAn issue once voted on cannot be voted on a second time at an adjourned meeting. We all know that.\nSo the chairman of the smaller 3 5 4 strong adjourned UG Mon Friday was out of order to\nput to the vote sections of the motion concerned with whether the rent strike would take\nplace.\nThe voting after a lot of time wasting therefore\nof 1 6 6 for a rent strike and175 against, 1 3\nabstaining, was null and void. Especially since there was only 9 in it!\nThe rest of the motion supporting the grants\ncampaign was passed almost unanimously.\nCan a smaller adjourned meeting overturn the\ndecision of a larger meeting? Of course not M The only fair solution is to re discuss the mo tion as amended so far at an EG M.We therefore call on the President to organise\nan EG Mon Thursday, January 1 8 , at 1.00 p.m. in the Great Hall.

Sep. late show.S at.11.15 p.m. THE BASICS OF LIFE\nASSURANCE EXPLAINED\nLife Assurance is basically a very simple subject\nand the purpose of this\narticle is to give a quick\nthumbnail sketch of the\nmain principles involved.\nThere are three types of\ninsurance cover:\nWhole Life \u2014 Endowment \u2014 Term Whole Life Assurance is\nwhat it says. The cover\nis on a person's life un til he dies.\nEndowment Assurance: Here a term of years is\nselected by the buyer. If\nhe survives that term, he\ncollects his money.\nShould he die within the\nstipulated period, the\nSum Assured is paid out\nto his dependants.\nTerm Assurance: This is\nthe very cheapest form\nof Life Assurance. A person takes out a policy to\ncover himself for a period of years. Should he\ndie within that period\nthe full amount of the\nSum Assured would be\npayable to his dependants. If, however, he\nsurvived, he gets nothing\nat all except the satisfaction of knowing he had bought a term of protection at a very low cost.\nWith and Without Profit\nPolicies\nOn both Whole Life and Endowment Assurance, the prospective buyer\ncan elect to have his\npolicy with or without\nprofits.\nExamples:\n(a) A man decides to\ntake out a without-profits\npolicy for \u00a32,000 Sum Assured. Should he live\nor die that exact amount\nis what someone would eventually receive.\n(b) If, however, the same\nman had decided on a \u00a32,000 sum Assured with profits policy, he\nwill share in the profits\nmade by his chosen\ncompany on their invest-ment s. The top companies over a25 year period\npaid out in 1 9 7 0 a return\nof 7 % per annum net to\ntheir policy holders. The\ntrue returns are actually\nhigher than this. Life\nAssurance premiums\nqualify for income tax\nrelief; this is now worth\n1 5 % of the premium for\na standard rate taxpayer.\nThese kinds of return are\na very impressive invest-ment.\nThe most important\nthing to bear i'n mind on\na with-profit policy is the\nenormous difference between the Life Assurance companies. For instance,\na man starting a with profit policy in 1 9 4 5 at\naged 2 9 paying \u00a350 a year would have received in 1 9 7 0 \u00a33,183 from\nthe top company and \u00a31,899 from one at the\nother end of the scale.\nDo ensure that you obtain good impartial ad vice from a reputable\nbroker, preferably one\nwho is either a member\nof the Corporation or the\nAssociation of Insurance\nBrokers.\nUnit Trusts\nThe last decade has\nseen the introduction of\nanother type of insurance\nlinked with investment.\nUnit Trusts enjoyed a boom period in the Six ties, when the Stock\nMarket was generally\nbuoyant. With this type\nof contract, the comp an ies invest your premiums\non the stock exchange\nand several Unit Trust\ngroups have recorded\nvery impressive capt it al gains for their clients.\nOne must remember,\nhowever, that the Stock\nMarket can go down, as\nwell as up, but the\ngrowth rate shown in\nmost companies' projections 5 % \u2014 7 % per\nannum net, should be\nattainable. One well\nknown Unit Trust has, in\nfact, appreciated by 1 8 %\nnet per annum every year\nsince its foundation 7\nyears ago. Do, however,\nchoose a policy which gives you freedom to let\nyour contract run on for\na while if necessary\nafter the maturity date,\njust in case this date\nhappens to coincide with\na Stock Market slump. Again, the advice of a good qualified broker is\nessential.\nLife Assurance plays\nan important part in our\nlives. It both protects us\nand provides us with a safe but good investment\nand incidentally can prove useful for House\nPurchase.\nHouse Purchase\nMost discerning men wish, eventually, to own their own homes. The normal way of setting out\nto do this is to approach\na Building Society for a loan. The amount they\nwill lend you is normally\nthree times your annual\nsalary, but one or two\nnew schemes have come out recently in which the\nadvance is greater than\nthis. Assuming you are\naccepted for a loan, you will have to repay both\nthe capital you have bor-rowed, and the interest\ncharged on it, at monthly\nintervals.\nMost young men with\nresponsibilities (wives\nand families) protect\nthis loan with an insurance policy, so that\nshould the worst happen\nhis dependants will have\na roof over their heads.\nThe most advantageous\nway of buying a house is\nwithout doubt to have\nthis insurance cover on\na with-profit basis. This\nmethod is the most expensive to adopt, but\nshould be aimed at. Like\neverything else in life\none gets what one pays\nfor.\nSummary Ironically enough, the\ngreatest advantage of\nLife Assurance is derived\nby the people who begin\nat a young age. Their\npremium payments are\nlow and irrespective of\ninflation cannot be in creased, though you can bet everything else will. It also makes sense because generally the\nyounger you are, the\nhealthier you are.

Blacked\nGovernment cut-back in\nHigher Education condemned\nThe Universities' Specialist Conference at Sheffield on January\n5th \u20147th voted to black the introduction of the Diploma of Higher\nEducation (Dip HE) award which was outlined in the recent Government White Paper on Education (reported in last week's FELIX).\nThe motion on the White\nPaper said that it was can-side red that the introduction of this two-year course\nrequiring University entrance qualifications (5\nGCE s,2 at A level) was\nsimply a move to reduce\nstudent numbers, since it\nwould become a substitute\nfor existing three-year\ncourses.\nThe Motion, which has\nbeen prior it is ed for discussion at the NUS National\nConference at Exeter in\nApril, also condemns the\ncutback in projected student numbers for 1981 from\n835,000 to 750,000 and the\nincrease in the student:\nstaff ratio of 10:1. The\nconference regarded the\nposing of different parts of\nthe education system\nagainst each other as\n\"short sighted and educationally disastrous\", and\ncondemned the Government for paying little attention to education while\nthey were increasing the\ndefence budget, for exam-ple, by 10 per cent.\nOther motions discussed\nand carried included ones\non Catering, Binary Sport\nand a Space Advertising\nAgency. The catering motion affirmed that \"the\nfight to reduce catering\nprices is part of the\nUnion's general policy of\nfighting for a grant in crease\". Conference deplored the Universities'\nGrants Committee ( UGC) policy of making catering\nself-balancing, said that\nbar profits should not be\nused to sub sidi sere fe ctor ies.\nConference recognised\nthat the binary .system extends to sport in the Binary Sport motion. They\nwelcomed the decision of\nthe British Committee for\nStudent Sport to form a unified organisation for\nstudent sport.\nBristol University, at\nlast gaining an opportunity to put forward their\nregular motion on space\nadvertising agencies (the\na gan cie s that persuade\ncompanies to advertise in union publications, e.g. \"Felix\") accused these of\n\"gross profiteering\", and\nconference voted that the\nUniversities'\nSpecialist\nConference\nThe University's Specialist Conference is as\nits name implies, amin iN US Conference about\nuniversity affairs and attended exclusively by delegates of university unions. The most recent was\nheld at Ran moor House, a hall-of-residence-plus, at Sheffield University on Friday\u2014Sunday,\n5th \u20147th January. Rather more than 100 delegates attended from Britain's44 universities, including five from Imperial: Rob Armitage, Charles\nDingley, Trcv Phillips, Malcolm Matthews and\n. Piers Corbyn turned up\ntoo to lend his voice and that of the IMG to the\nproceedings, and with yours truly there to report\nthe jamboree, Imperial was probably the best-represented College there.\nThe Universities' Specialist is one of several\nspecialist conferences run every year by the NUS for different sectors of higher and further education which report back to the national conferences\nin December and April. Impressive for the efficiency with which discussions were held and motions passed, most delegates thought the conference very worthwhile\u2014as\nwell as an excellent excuse for a few frolics in\nstainless* surroundings.\n*a reference to steel.\nNUS Exec should investigate the possibility of setting up their own nonprofit making agency.\nA major feature of the\nconference was the way it\nwas split up for part of\nthe time into discussion\ngroups on various topics,\nincluding Trade Unions\nand Universities, NUS Areas and Universities,\nHall Fees and Catering\ncharges, Representation,\nthe Environment and Student Community Action,\nthe E.E.C.. Vietnam and\nSouth Africa. Most of\nthese groups put motions\nforward to the whole con-ference, and they were all passed.\nDr. R. Hunter, ViceChancellor of Birmingham\nUniversity, spoke to the\nconference, supposedly on\nthe subject of \"University\nAutonomy\", but was either deliberately evasive or\nknew little. An inconsequential speech was followed by an hour's ques-t ions, and the delegates'\ntempers frayed rapidly at\nthe seemingly endless replies of \" no comment\" or\n\"I don't know\".\nAbout the only coherent\nfacts to appear from this\nsession was the reiteration\nof Dr. Hunter's opinions\non representation: that students should play as full a part as possible in university affairs, but must not\nplay any part in decisions\non the appointment or salaries of staff or the academic assessment of stu-dents!\nFEUX FINANCIALLY\nFELIX FINANCIALLY will be returning next week, when Derek Cummings, our regular expert contributor, will be telling you\" How to Lose Money Without Really Dying\". He will also be appearing in the flesh at IC on four consecutive Tuesdays,\nstarting on January 30th. His General Studies lunchtime lectures, as anyone\nwho has been to them in the past can tell you, are packed with punch \u2014 in fact, you' ll probably think you didn't know money existed until you hear\nDerek tell you how to make it work for you.\nFELIX next week will be carrying full details: in the meantime, Derek\nwelcomes questions arising from his series of articles that have appeared\nin FELIX so far this year, which may be answered either at the meetings\nor in an article. Write to him c/o FELIX, or telephone Int 2 8 8 1 .\nI0NN LANE\nWell, at least we have a grants policy!\nNo rent strike and not much in the way\ndf suggestions as to what else we should\nactually do to get the much needed in crease, but at least we have a start \u2014\nwhat I.C. students actually want: the\ninterim increase of \u00a365, an annual review based on the student cost index\nand a big fight at NUS conference on\nthe \u00a3100 increase, abolition of the means\ntest and the post-graduate demands for\nan extra grant for London, the \" London weighting\" (Everyone except PC's gets\nmore money for living in London).\nAn increase for postgraduates and\nan end to the means test are NUS policy\n\u2014 it's up to us to see that NUS as a whole pushes for these demands and\nthat Will not happen unless IC is very\nactive in the rest of the grants cam-pa ign. For instance IC is over one-third\npostgraduates. Unless the union gets\nthem organised and active we can\nhardly expect the Government to listen\nto the NUS claim on their behalf. Al though the election of PG Affairs Officer has been postponed (there are quite\na number of my fellow PCs getting involved and there is no reason why aPG affairs committee could not start to\nfunction almost immediately.\nAlso if we hope to convince delegates\nfrom o 'ther universities at NUS conference that our more militant demands\nare serious, we must explain to them\nthe reasons why I.C. let them down over\nthe national rent strike. We must not get\nthe reputation of being talkers and not\ndoers!\nWhy No Rent Strike?\nOne reason I must say was a tactical\nerror on my part. The withdrawal of the\nnew halls levy should have been dis-cussed, at length, separately. On Thursday it just confused the issue.\nBut more important is the bread and\nbutter one that students in hall have\ncomparatively low rents and I failed to\nconvince them that they should look to\nthe future or assist their fellow students\nor even help themselves for next year.\nI think also we have failed to realise\nthat no matter how eloquent a case the\nRector may make for us to the Government the simple fact of IC students being on a mass rent strike would have revealed far better our determination to\nput an end to the drop in our standard\nof living.\nWe will be trying to enlist the Rector's support for our case of course. But I can't see that bis humble plea on our\nbehalf will carry anything like as much\nweight as those vice-chancellors facing\nrent strikes and refectory boycotts. But every drop counts, of course.\nAnd now on to brighter things, cast off\nthis gloomy spell and on to the idyllic\nsurroundings of happier regions of IC \u2014\nlike \u2014\nMooney\nI haven't eaten in Mooney all week\nowing to writing bump h sheets, speeches,\nPresident's Pieces and attending UG Ms( Also my grant/pay isn't through yet).\nI 've almost forgotten what \" it's\" like!\nHowever, it was rather disturbing to\nhear at the Refectory Committee that\nnothing had been done on the problem\nof hygiene and cockroaches since the\nprevious meeting. Admittedly this was\nthe holiday period and a steam cleaning\nmachine had broken down, but as I said\nbefore the holidays, the situation needs\nto be watched carefully.\nEnts.\nDue to some mess and damage at a few concerts last term, the College has\nasked the union to consider its entertainments policy. Do we want really big\nconcerts weekly, letting in a very big\nproportion of non-students to sub sid is e our own students? Are too few students\ninterested to make it worthwhile? Or do you like the set up as it is?\nDemocratic decisions need an in formed discussion and the sooner we\nhear your views the batter.\n'1 can do any fink' Guitarist proves wild claim in public\nat Ents Concert The Great Hall was packed, as always,\nfor the concert last Saturday. Strawbs\nhave now turned more towards the rock\nside of music since the replacement of\nlead guitarist Tony Hooper by Dave\nLambert, whose guitar work was crystal\nclear at most times. Their set contained\nseveral of their more recently written\nmaterial, including their two recent\nsingles \" Lay Down\" and \"Part of the\nUnion\", presumably both of which will\nbe on their forthcoming album \"Burst-ing at the Seams\".\nTheir old material was not forgotten,\nhowever, and no Strawbs concert would\nbe complete without the classic \" Hang man and the Papist\". When introducing\nthis Dave Cousins became serious for\nonce, giving a short voicing of his opinions on war, otherwise there tended to\nbe longish gaps in between numbers\nwhile he told rather humorous anecdotes.\nDave Lambert continued with the comedian role, when it came to his solo\nspot. Rather unexpectedly, he played\n\" The William Tell Overture\" by slapping\nhis cheeks and holding his open mouth\nto the microphone, followed by \"I Can Do Anyfink\", which he dedicated to all skin heads.\nThey also performed several of the\nstronger tracks from their \"Grave New World\" album, including the title track\nwhich they used to open their set, producing a very full sound, each musician\nblending together nicely, with some very\ngood keyboard play from Blue Weaver. The acoustic piece was played by\nJohn Ford and Richard Hudson, who\nmoved from bass guitar and drums to\nacoustic guitars.\nThe supporting group, Wheels, consisted of three guitarists, a bassist and a drummer. Their set tended to lack sufficient substance, though they did produce\na few good tunes, notably their last\nnumber which stood out from their more\nusual melodic sound.\nG. J.K. "

The cast shows\nno signs of fatigue or perfunctory per-form ance; it is as lively as last year.\nSuperficially, the show entails a series\nof sketches more-or-less based on\nChaucer: bawdy beautiful (Pun). If all you want is an evening of good enter-tain ment, enough said. However, there\nis a more subtle story underlying the\ntales, requiring careful attention, and retention of the sketches.\nThe opening starts with a banging \"1\nhave a noble cock!\"( Yanks will catch\nthis), goes through various stages of\nsexual relationships to end by answering (correctly, I thought) the question\n\" What do women most desire?\" A bit\nmelodramatic \u2014 perhaps daunting \u2014\nbut it leaves one thinking, as every good\nplay should.\nWell worth a visit, even if the music\ndoes drown some songs, (an unfortunate indictment against every musical\nI 've seen in London) the worst case being the beautifully haunting \" Love Will Conquer AH\". It's performed twice a show, making it four tries \u2014 I 've yet to\nhear it, even though sitting in a \u00a31.50\nStalls or \u00a31.50 Dress Circle seat.\nBut one need not pay a pound; early\nperformances and student groups of any\nsize have reductions. My ticket each\ntime was 25p for the \u00a31.50 seat.\nI recommend a visit \u2014 except Chaucer addicts, who may not recognise it.\nIt's at the Phoenix Theatre, Charing\nCross Road, one with reasonable a co us tics.\nJim Fenner\nFelix\nCulture\n\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\"\nby Hunter S. Thompson (Paladin, 40p) \"The American Dream is something\nthat most of us are probably not looking for, unlike Nixon and Agnew\": yet\nMr. Thompson presents a good take-off\nof this very subject in his latest book.\nThe story starts with our heroes somewhere around Barstow, on the edge of\nthe desert. When the drugs take hold, a voice was screaming \" Holy Jesus! What\nare these goddam animals?\"\nThen it was quiet again.\nThe attorney had taken his shirt off\nand was pouring beer on his chest to\nfacilitate the tanning process and so\non . . . across the desert at frightening\nspeed.\nNot having tried out most of the\ndrugs used in the book, I felt a little\nleft out of the story. Even so, one can\nstill imagine the \"perilous drug-enlivened\nconfrontations with casino operators,\nbartenders, police officers with a special\ninterest in the narcotics problem and\nother representatives of the silent majority who have a hallucinatory humour\nand nightmare terror rarely seen on the\nprinted page.\"\nThe book is very \"interestingly\" illustrated with drawings by Ralph Stendman hitched from 'Rolling Stone'. I say\n\"interestingly\" as I found the drawings\nof the characters grotesque and quite\nhorrifying\u2014but perhaps that's what it's all about.\nHunter Thompson is an unusual and\nrefreshing writer who contributes regularly to such unlikely publications as\nthe New York Times Magazine, Ramparts, and, of course, Rolling Stone.\nThompson's most famous book is probably \"Hell's Angels\", and it is easy to see a resemblance in \"Fear and Loathing\nin Las Vegas\".\nThe whole book tends to boil down to\na mad, corrosive piece of prose poetry\ngoing, where who knows, but certainly\ngoing. The NY T claims that it picks up\nwhere Norman Mailer leaves off. I don't think that that is a very good comp ari son, as Mailer certainly gets more out\nof his writing than Hunter.\nI enjoyed my savage journey to the\nHeart of the American Dream\u2014but I'm glad I bought the return ticket.\nDAVID HOB MAN The Landsnapper Sneeze by Dave C ribble "
