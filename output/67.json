    "content": "t FELIX PROFILE PETER LEMIN\nBeneath the R.C.S. Presidential Topper, there lurks this year the cheerful oo un ten ance of Peter A.Lem ln,a man Gamed for hj a wisdom\nand his wit. One of our few remaining ex service men, relic of a bygone age, Peter can recall( when suitably lubricated) the great Incendiary rag of Guy Fawkes Night1949 when he participated as an I.C. representative in the celebrated uno ff ici al Tug of War against the United Metropolitan Services( comprising members of the Constabulary and the London Fire Brigade) The latter involuntarily supplied a hose for use in place of a rope. Fortunately Peter managed to avoid the. Judicial reprisals taken by the miserable and\nun sporting losers of this historic contest, and\nhe ha thus survived to this day under the guise of a sober, righteous and responsible member of the Union. While In our midst he has found time for a variety of pursuits. Having acquired in his R.A.F. career an unexpected ab'^l ty to shoot straight, he swiftly rose to fame on the rifle range. Apart from having represented Imperial College Rifle Club for four years, he has also earned himself a University of London Purple for shooting. Peters academic career has been somewhat\nchequered. He has ended up as an Organic Research Chemist working in the Department of Inorganic. Chemistry applying Physical Methods to Biochemical P>o bl ems.\nA pursuit he has Deen forced to ao and on was\nthe I.C. hop, where in he met the girl he eventually married. As he himself says\" it Just goes to show\nyou can't be too careful\". After two years of married life he contends that he has discovered what makes women ti ok and considers himself comp e tent to predict the vagaries of feminine behaviour. Precisely where he Intends to employ these new-found techniques remains in doubt, but nevertheless he heartily recommends married life to his friends. Prominent in all R.C.S, festivities, Peter revealed himself as something of an artist last year by perpetrating a Roman frieze for the Orgy\nat Christmas. His appearances at Smoking Concerts, however, are even\" better known. His earliest performance was in the first Smoking Concert in1950 where in he made a debut as one of the Andrews Sisters, a female of creditable form and soothing voice. Unfortunately owing to poor foundations his figure was noticed to collapse into totally un fem in l ne asymmetry. At last year's Concert he was responsible for two of the acts: a satire on the Board of Governors, and an expurgated version of Eskimo Nell, It was felt that Dr. Bow d ler himself could scarcely have done better with such uncompromising material. Holding strong views on most student problems and the conduct of all Union affairs, Peter Lem ln will find his skill and experience as a debater standing him in good stead in his year of office. In addition to knowing they have an eloquent advocate of student needs in higher quarters, the R.C.S. Union can look forward to a year of clear sighted guidance and forthright leadership. Evening Dress < W\\12/6 Double\nTHE ENGINEERS BALL FRIDAY 26th NOVEMBER\n8 (am. hi 2 am.\nHALL DINNER.\nThe evening of Tuesday Oct. 18th. was the ooo-as ion of both the President's Sherry Party for officers of the Union, and the first Hall Dinner of the\npresent session. The party later moved down to join those at tending hall dinner for a glass of sherry in the\nStaff Common Room. I am told the sherry decanter\nin this room, which for the past few years has remained at a fairly steady level, was drained comp let ely in a. matter of seconds! This dastardly deed originating largely from those who had not pat d to have it.. tut,t ut. However by a master pie oe of observation they paid later! Prof. Fl pp ard, Dean of C.&G., was Chairman for the even igg and the college President;. 'ike I.'ea le the vice-chairman. They were seated at opposite\nends of the central table which was almost entirely filled by the guests from the President's party.\nThe U.D. H.is a.r. ost suitable room for such an occasion with its cutlery and silver candlesticks. It was suggested that members of I.C. on leaving. could present silverware to be used on such occ as ions. A silver bowl on the Chairman'stable inscribed 'Part I repeaters 1954' would, I feel, be\nmost appropriate. The evening continued along its customary\nformal lines until the Royal Toast, after which\nthe spirit of the central table began to take cont ro l.A candle was seen to wander down the table\nfor a change of scenery and a table mat glided gently through t ne still air reminding one of the\never-popular flying saucer. Mr Mooney's best saucers were a medium for'. he exchange of comic verse and all xo o personal remarks. Alas, no one\nstarted a limerick competition!\nThe company then retired to the Staff Common Room where coffee was served to complete an\nextremely pleasant evening. - Some v, ere heard to\nsay that it was the best Hall Dinner '.hey could\nremember - per haD s it was.\nFor ,he Denefit of the fresher s, Dinner in hall is held in tue Upper Dining Hall each Tuesday\nat 7.50 p.m. The cos: I feel is very reasonable :\n4/- tue dinner, 1/- beer, l/6d sherry, l/6d port. Is hall go again - will you come?. D> H>H> QUEUE THIS SIDE PLEASE\nImperial College is making history* Already there are more than two thousand people\nstudying here, and the number is still increasing but, at the same time, many facilities have been\ncurtailed by the ambitious reconstruction program\nwhich is in full progress. One of these facilities, the immediate enlarge-nen t of the refectories, seems to exist no longer,\nat less t, the author has observed no effort to\nrelieve the congestion which occurs every lunch time.\nIn the Ayrton Hall, as in the Union, it is com so u knowledge that to dine without waiting for at least twenty minutes one must either arrive there earlier than the rush, wait till it clears or eat outside. What of these alternatives? No one who wants a degree can afford to leave\ntheir lecture five times a week before it finishes. To wait until the oro wd clears is as edifying as queueing for that time.\nThe nearest Cafeterias and Restaurants are half a mile away, and the cheaper establishments such as\nLyons' are filled to overflowing. There are very few\nwho can pay the expensive prices demanded by the\nother places In South Kensington.\nShort of fasting, as one has to do when the\ngrant expires, w hio hat this early stage should\nnot be entertained too seriously, Ahat is the answer to this pressing problem?\nThere are at least two possible solutions. The executives of the these colleges could arrange\ntimetables so that the R.C.S. and Mines start and\nfinish their morning's study thirty minutes before\n(or after! Guilds, thus staggering the lunches in roughly equal sittings. Alternatively, Jehaugir Hall, which at present is,\nused as an examination room of the University of\nLondon, could be transformed into an extension of\n\"Queenies\", the food being taken from one building to.the other, a matter of fifty yards, in insulated containers. Who said dine in Q.A? "

    "content": "HOPES & HOPS\nWell, we have had our first Entertainments\nCommittee Hop in Jehangir Hall. How did it go?\nVery well, except for a few minor criticisms, and\nwe are sure the Entertainments Committee will not\nmind us bringing them up. Since the evening was\nvery successful, It would be worthwhile attending to the minor defects ao that Jehangir Hops become\na feature of our diaries. For anyone who arrived after815 the first sight, after the imposing Entrance Hall, was a queue\nto get in, with girls in it as well! This was a new departure for I.C., ao buy your tickets before\nSaturday night in future. Inside, the appearance\nof the Hall itself was ver vole a sant and the\nr lo or excellent. The. ladies seemed to he very\npleased with it all, firstly because they were\nin as light minority, and most Important of all there was no bashful mass of males round the\nentrance l Thus a bloodless victory has been won;\nfor years people have battled with the problem\nof how Jlo get the men away ir orr. cue door of the\nGym. at Hops. The answer is to hold the Dances\nsomewhere else, which has its entrance at the\nside, as in Jehan gir. Many of the older stalwarts were d is app o in ted at the non-appearance of a Bar. On this occasion it was unavoidable, but for all future dances\nfull drinking facilities will be available. One big disadvantage noticed was the lack of\n\" a it ting out\" space. Not necessarily a \"dark\nroom\"(that o an wait till afterwards), but somewhere quiet, with more space for dancing would\nbe very useful. In this respect people who have\nbeen brought up on Gym. Hops, with the extra facilities of the Upper Dining Hall( the Dark Room,) *\nand the Old Lounge, have been thoroughly spoil is s,.^ In Jehangir, the long corridor, with its tasty'.,;\ndecorations of old bookshelves, was the only quill;\nspot where the music was still audible. This brings us to the final point, the acoustics were very poor. Loudspeakers sl\\sng from the\ncentre of the roof would give better service. The\nfinal grouse is a perennial one; some of the reo or da were Just not suitable for dancing, and in this instance one couldn't hear the loudspeaker\nannouncements In any case.\n.HEARTS AFLUTTER IN C.& G.U The third year students of the City and;. Guilds go to the Lond op^ School of Economics on one\nday a week and the following startling discovery was soon made - they have girls there. To the severely masculine, practical minded engineers this was a pleasant shock. The heads of even the most staid and outwardly respectable students were\nseen to turn frequently when ascending or desc en ding the crowded stairs. A train of thought was started which has developed into a clam our why can't we have girls.,,\nat C. and G.'? They would not, of course, be\nexpected to pass examinations, but I hope to show\nthat, merely front heir presence, benefits would\nbe had by both sides. Would not the presence of a delicate fair hand on the strain gauge ( ne ttc mention the fevered student brow) help tor% duce\nthe dangerously high accident rate to these and other fragile instruments( again not to mention students). Could not female intuition choose\nwire of the right diameter for use with. voltmeters and ammeters? In the face of competition from the fair sex who could hand in the doodled scraps of blotting paper which pa'ss fc r drawings in so many oases? The girls could learn typing at the L.C.S. and attendance at lectures would give them,\na grounding in engineering language. Any engineer who has experienced the abysmal i.n or ance of the modern typist would welcome one conversant with the technical jargon.. The experience in drawing would ensure a flow of good tracers to the drawing offices of Victoria Street. Would not even the teaching staff find them a change from the relatively predictable male? The social advantages are too obvious to mention but with the increase in evening activity the\" brown b agger\" would become extinct and the\" green t ioke ter\" would not have to travel in the teatime rush hour.\nI have tried to show that both students and the engineering profession would benefit by this revolutionary change and I would urge all Guilds men to give it their serious consideration.

Mr Gadsden proposed the College, tii e most interesting part of his toast being a little thing that went something like this' \"Candy is dandy But liquor is quicker.\" Professor L instead replied to the toast. He pointed out to an amazed audience that a little re.search is. done in the Mines, and that they have actually published a book about it.\" The stunned fresher s were now congratulated by their President Mr Lem in, on their good fort uni in being fresher s of R.C.S. and not of Delft; i.e. not fogged, de bagged and otherwise put upon; He\nalso speculated( rather wildly) on Cassandra' s love life, drawing entirely erroneous conclusions. Both the I.C. bar and the improved toilet facilities in R.C.S. were mentioned by the President, as being centres pf cultural life, and he concluded by expecting to meet most of the fresher s there. The freshness of some of the guests was commented upon by Mr Anderson, who found for all the staff( and ex staff) present, some avenue on which they had only just embarked. The President of Mines, replying10* the guests,, expressed his sentiments about R.C.S., his chief point being that Cassandra had the right idea; During the closing ten minutes of the toasting, noises of fv. ere heard and suspicion aroused in the R.C.S. breast. A certain Guilds man was seen peering through the serving hatch in the U.D. H. and the doors were then found to be barricaded. Not all the oom bin ed strength of the R.C.S., fresh or ot ner wise, could open the main door. The backdoor was eventually breached and the R.C.S. s tre a med down and into. the S ntu ance Hall hoping to take the offenders in the rear. Guilds r however were one\nstep ahead, they were complacently propping up the bar. They were thrown out, returned and thrown out again, and it looked asifa sort of dynamic equilibrium had been established. Accordingly a truce was called, the proceedings' ending in such harmony\nthat a Guilds man generously described the evening as \" the best R.C.S. fresher s' 'do' I've ever been to.\" MINES\nThere comes a time in every beer drinker's life when he shudders at the thought of that extra pint, strong men snake their Heads and look significantly at; each other. When'the\nMines fresh ershad their dinner, there'we're\nmany strong men who shook tn eir heads.*.\nThe night of Friday22 nd was cold/ and win dy; as hordes of miners made their way to and\nfrom the Queen's Arms their feet \"were hastened by the thought of refreshment at the other end. The dinner started a; few minutes after7.50 and went on for over ninety minutes. There are more fresher s this year than the2 nd and3 rd year combined, which' meant that the whole of the mines was present either as host or guest. GUILDS\nOn the evening of Friday, October 15th, the\nGuilds Freshers assembled in the Upper Dining Hall\nfor their annual buffeting and welcome from the\nGuilds Union.\nYour correspondent who, since his ticket said\n\"7.00 for 7.30\", thought he would arrive at 7.30,\nmissed the little party where the principal\nspeakers were strengthening themselves with sherry\nand port. Instead, he arrived at 7.36 and found\nthat the Freshers were up to standard since most\nof the food and free beer had already vanished.\nSeveral well-known second and even third year\n'fresher s' were also there. These gentlemen did\nnot seem to be so interested in the food as the\ngenuine fresher s; rather they showed their experience by strategic grouping around the barrels.\nThe President, Andy Levins, clad in his robes\nof of floe, Introduced himself- and the Guilds\nSpanner (w hio his not tho original totem pole) to\nthe assembly. Professor Hewitt proposed the\nhealth of the Dean, Professor Pippard. Both,\nrather naturally, reminded the Fresher3 that they\nshou jd mix in a little work with their Union activities. Professor Pippard said that for the first time Guilds register had topped the 1000 mark and\nhe wanted to see 1000 on the final pass list. Kim\nAsh proposed the toast of the-guests, to which Dr.\nSparkes replied. He dealt at some length with\nthe proposed College extensions, and made a big\nhit when he said that not only the students were\naware of the shortage of women undergraduates at\nGuilds. If anybody could find some suitable can-di dates, several members of the staff, including\nDr. Sparkes, would be pleased to give them encouraging interviews.\nAlec Praser proposed the toast to the\nFreshers and told them that they should mix in some Union activities with their work. He reminded the Dean that people do not only sometimes\nfail their lat. Year exams, for example, he\nhimself was trying his Part II again!\nThe old hands initiated the Freshers into t ne meaning of 'a Boomalaka\u2022, and then those who were\nstill thirsty removed downstairs to begin the real\nbusiness of the evening. In no time at all the\nBar was quickly filled with the sounds of singing.\nAs time went on, your correspondent remembers less\nand less - perhaps thankfully. Although the\noriginality and wide general knowledge of one of\nthe Freshers from Manchester should be valuable to\nGuilds, he seemed to know at leas* one new verse\nto all the songs. At 11.00 the bar shut to make\nItself presentable for the morrow, and the party\nremoved itself for another Boomalaka on the Tennis\nCourts, and then on to the Royal College of Art\nHop in Cromwell Road. But that is another\nstory\nThe yard was traditionally good, the wi nner turning in the excellent time of10.2 sees. The Presidents of R.C.S. and Guilds were promised drinks if they could tell a good story. The Guilds President could only win a yard of orange squash, while Mr. Lem in performed better and deserved agin in his portion. Old hands missed t nero using\" charcoal\" on the tennis courts afterwards, nor was there anytime left for singing in the oar, but the number of people who went away singing was fantastic. "

Share was an excellent entry, ranging from a competitor In his father's Riley to a Bentam which\nwas given a hasty de-coke at lunch-time, and, as\nthe last bolt was tightened the parched driver sew\nthe \"White Hart\" close on the s s roke of two.\nShe field was divided into two, one half \"taking\nthe driving tests in the morning and motoring\nround the thirty five point-to-point in the after-noon, whilst the other half reversed t fe is proc ced ure.\nThere were seven tests, of which five had to ue \"\n\u2022\ncompleted; these included \"Cold\" start, regularity\nwheel changing, slow riding, blindfold driving,\nparking, acceleration and braking, and garaging\ntests.\nDue to the kind offer of the owner, our reporter\ntraversed the point-to-point on the pillion of \u00bb\nSunbeam, and in his endeavour to show how well he\ncould map reed, he navigated the vehicle down a mud track, over a tiny foot-bridge and across* a fallow field onto a road which shouldn't have been\nthere.\nMany people stayed after tea to take part in the\nuni g. ua combination of an egg-end-spoon race with\nthe Grand Prix with Hunt-the-Thimble, the thimble\nbeing a Marshal in a tree or a ditch or *>von the\npub.
