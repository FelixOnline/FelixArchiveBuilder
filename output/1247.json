    "content": "FELIX SCIENCE Tomorrow's Energy Supply...\nfrom Space?\nPopulation growth, urbanization and the\nimprovement of some people's quality of life are\nsome of the tendencies that are predicted for\nthis century. More people, more mega-cities\nand better lives mean more electricity con-sump tion. And if we keep our current power\nsupply systems, then it also means accelerated\nGreenhouse Effect and/or exhaustion of non\nrenewable energy sources.\nSpace Solar Power (SSP) could be a solution.\nBut what is it? Well, it is not new but not ready\nyet. The idea consists of a system of satellites\nin Earth orbit. The solar cells in space, convert\nsolar energy into microwave beams or laser\nbeams and then transmit these to Earth. On the\nground, receiving antenna stations convert the\nradiated energy to useful electrical power.\nFinally, utility networks distribute the electricity\nlike nowadays.\nPeter Glaser is considered to be the pioneer\nof SSP concept: He formulated the idea in\n1968 i.e.34 years ago! So why hasn't this system been implemented yet? One of the obstacles is still the high cost of transporting the\nrequired massive structures to low Earth orbit.\nRecent researches revealed that photovoltaic\nthin film architectures were quite promising.\nSome even suggested that materials for SSP\ncould be exploited directly from the Moon or\nmeteorites. Another issue is the impact of the\nbeams on our health. Still a controversial topic.\nThe pros say that firstly, solar energy is free,\nclean, safe, and available to all humanity, so\nlet's use it. Secondly, solar panels in space have\nhigher efficiency since they don't have the\nrainy-cloudy-day problem of their on the ground\ncousins. Thirdly, in regard to the costs, the\nprice of electricity produced by nuclear plants\nwas also higher at the beginning. And regarding\nhealth, people are still using their mobile\nphones, even though it is supposedly harmful.\nIn any case, we usually use two-dimensional\nreasoning in our quest for technical solutions,\nignoring possibilities offered by things such as\nnon-Terran environments where easy solutions\nto our power problems could exist. Even if SSP\nis not for the next 10 years, it is still a technological challenge and is very likely to find some\napplications in other projects like Mars\nExploration and Space Settlement.\nMore information can be found at:\nhttp://www.space frontier. org\nhttp://www.ssi.org/energy.html\nhttp://space solar power. nasa.gov\nFrancoise Mei\nIC Scientist Profiles\n#1: Abdus Salam (1926 -1996)\nAbdus Salam was the last\nImperial physicist and the first\nMuslim to win a Nobel Prize. He\nwas born in Jhang, Pakistan, and\ngraduated from the University of\nCambridge in 1946 with a double first in physics and mathematics. He decided that his\ninterests lay in theoretical\nphysics, and after stints working\nfirstly at the University of Punjab\nin Pakistan, and then as a fellow\nof St. John's College in\nCambridge, he was offered the\nchair of theoretical physics at Imperial in\n1957.\nThroughout the late 50's and early 60's, Salam worked at finding a unified description\nof the different fundamental forces. His work\nled to the discovery of the electroweak theory in 1967, which unified the electromagnetic force with the weak force. It was for this\nwork that Salam shared the Nobel Prize in\nPhysics in 1979 with Sheldon\nGlashow and Steven Weinberg of\nHarvard.\nSalam accepted the post of scientific adviser to President Ayub\nKhan of Pakistan in 1959, with\nthe hope of advancing the development of his home country.\nMany of the schemes he pro-posed, such as combating land\nwater logging, failed because the\ngovernment was unwilling to commit the resources. He was successful, however, in setting up an\nInternational Centre for Theoretical Physics,\nin Trieste, Italy, so that theoretical physicists\nfrom third world countries could visit to keep\nup with international research while continuing to work in their own countries. This was\nsomething that Salam had been unable to do\nhimself.\nFor more information about Abdus Salam\nsee union.ic.ac.uk/pakistan/tribute.html.\nFelix needs\nScience and\nTechnology\nwriters\nContact\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwith your ideas\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "Future\nSaturday @ Ministry of Sound\nThe first thing I have to say is that it does\nmake a difference going to a clean, nicely decorated venue - and the Ministry of Sound certainly is that.\nAfter chilling out in the house room, it was\nlam and time to move on to the main room for\nthe trance. Mr Dave Pearce was on the decks.\nThe room was rammed, and the King of Caps\n(Pearce) played to the crowd - dropping classics like Cafe Del Mar. I thought this was a great start to the night.\nUnfortunately Guy Ornadel managed to play\na set not even worth mentioning (I heard it was\nshit - Ed). The most memorable part was some\ntw at taking a leak in the corner, and then\njumping around with his cronies shouting the\nlyrics to Hey Baby. Luckily John Askew managed to play a good few hours to take me\nthrough to 8am and leave me feeling in high\nspirits.\nFor me, the music was too hard, too early -but on the whole the night was good. I would\ndefinitely recommend this night to anyone who\nwants to experience a night out at a Super\nClub.

In\nthe small Black & White Room you can hear\nsome garage, but it's in the Main Room where\nthe real action happens. The music tends to\nstart with trance y breaks and finish with some\neuphoric, uplifting trance.\nFor the Halloween Special the crowd was\ntreated to a live set by up and coming music-maker Future Disciple. But it's at about 3am when the best music kicks in. With Residents\nGraham Gold (bald headed mongrel off Kiss\n100) and Dave Lambert often on the decks for\nthe last few hours, you tend to hear a few\nanthems along with the latest tunes like \"The\nOpera Song\".\nPeach is generally a minimal attitude, young\ncrowd with a first-class music policy. The only\ndown side can be the dirty floors and often\nflooded toilets, but if you can cope with this\nyou'll be fine. A thousand people a week for 9\nyears can't be wrong?

    "content": "FELIX MUSIC REVIEWS15 Live Review\nESP & 80'sB Line Matchbox Disaster\nQ Awards Party, Camden Ding walls 2/5\nIt's the Q Awards Nominations\nParty, and the room is filled with\npeople who think they've got a vital role in today's music business than they actually ever will\nhave. But still, they're the ones\nwho write about music and make\nthe small bands into the big\nbands, so you'd think that the\ntwo groups on show tonight\nwould make some effort at making a good impression. You'd think wrong.\nPoor, poor Electric Soft\nParade, where did it all go so\nwrong? Simple answer - the\nbeginning.\nIf it wasn't for the fact that half\nthe crowd consists of die-hard\nESP fans, the band could easily\nhave been mistaken for the latest\ngroup on the local music circuit.\nAnd not a particularly good one\nat that. \"It's such a chore playing\nin London. We always end up\nmaking you think we're dead...\nor shit. Which we are - both,\"\nthe lead singer explains to the\nbewildered on-look ers. I wouldn't argue with him.\n\"...And I don't feel I'm in control anymore,\" they sing out in\nchart-hit There's A Silence - and\nthen the mic cuts. The band are\nout of tune, the electronics\nrefuse to cooperate, and the\ndrummer's 'rock 'n' roll' frustration looks more like a spoilt\nchild's tantrum. When they are\ntogether, the guitar sound rises\nand rises to what should be an\nincredible vocal climax - only it's not. The beautiful sound that is\nESP's fine specimen of an\nalbum, Holes In The Wall, and\nwhich gave them a Mercury\nAward nomination, just doesn't appear tonight and ESP know it\nall too well. As they charge off\nthe stage, muttering some\ninaudible comment - could be an\napology, but more likely a curse -their soon-to-be-wrecked drum\nkit and guitar suffer the full blow\nof their disappointment.\nOur hearts rise with expectant\nhope as the 80s Matchbox BLine Disaster members take up\ntheir positions. Could they possibly be the saviours of tonight's dismal failure? I wish I could say\nyes, I really do; I wish I could\nwrite how their rock passion\ninspired an energy in the crowd\nunlike any other seen before. But\nI can't. Despite their fury-filled lyrics,\ntheir strong yet genius ly created\nmoments of guitar power, and\ntheir delicate additions of sweet\nelectronica, the band still lack\nthat something that makes you\nstare in disbelief - that rare ability to make you wish the night\nwould never end. Even when the\nlanky-haired lead singer walks\nconfidently through the crowd,\nscreaming lyrics at random terrified crowd-members, it only\nmakes us laugh, not ooh and ah\nin wonder.\nAll in all, a night of dashed\nhopes and disappointments.\nKeira\n3372\nThe Forum\n5/5\nWith the rush of young bands\ncoming to the fore this year, it\nmeans that JJ72 are left looking\nlike rock veterans, despite just\nleaving their teens, and only\nbringing out their second album.\nIf there was any doubt before,\nthen there is surely none now.\nMark Greaney with his Byronic\nhaircut and tweed jacket is the\nspitting image of Crispian Mills.\nThankfully, Mark now shares\nCrispian's tremendous energy\nand stage presence, coupled with\nvocals that you either think\nsound like the Chipmunks, or\nare as graceful and majestic as\nhis idol Billy Corgan.\nIt is the doubters who are\nproved wrong tonight, as he volleys through a set, with a mix\nfrom both albums, from the gentle tones of Brother Sleep, to\nthe inevitably thunderous\nOxygen. Even forgetting the\nwords to Snow doesn't hinder\nhim, as the / to Sky tracks are\ntaken to heart by the crowd, just\nas much as their glorious debut,\nwith Formulae and Glimmer in\nparticular instantly bringing\nabout huge cheers and waves of\npo going. The fact that Mark is so mes-me rising makes you forget how\ngood the other members are.\nFergal pounds the drums with\nsuch menace that you must\nthink they need replacing after\neach show, and Hilary is now\ncapable of killer baselines and\neven a spot of singing on their\nsumptuous David Essex cover.\nThe set ends with an unearthly thrash, deadly enough to\nbring on the apocalypse, before\nwe are treated to a moment of\ncomedy rock opera in the style\nof their mates Muse.\nNamely, Mark jumping up\nonto the drum stand at the climax of the show before falling\noff backwards and continuing to\nproduce fits of distortion lying\non the floor, whilst the other\nmembers just walk off. Proof, if\nneeded, that they do have a sense of fun.\nThe greatest sin JJ72 can\ncommit is to be still playing in\nsmall venues in a year's time.\nDeepesh\nSingles\nPaul Heaton\nCouple\nThe Perfect\nPerhaps drugs, bludgeoning or\noxygen starvation would explain\nthe camp tunes Paul Heaton\nhas become famous for. The\nmaestro from Hull seems intent\non transmitting the worst kind\nof musical torment via trash\nsuch as The Perfect Couple.\nThe sickly sugared melodies\nhammer at the head whilst\nsimultaneously hoisting out the\ncontents of the gut. The tune is\ndisgusting, the lyrics are more\nso and instruments seemed to\nhave been recorded perfectly to\ntransfer straight to the musa k version. To be fair there was\nnever much to expect; Paul\nHeaton has released nothing\nremotely respectable in the last\nten years .\nI'm sure there is a market for\nthis music, in the realms of bad\ntaste of cheap karaoke. I would\ngo as far as saying this is\nmaybe the most widely sold\nsong in the seedy pubs of Hull,\nwhere it is the fashion for the\ndamned to drink themselves to\ndeath under the terrible sounds\nof Heaton. Unless the\nmasochist in you needs the\npain, give this song an extremely large berth.\n0/5 Sachit\nIdlewild - Live In A Hidii\nPlace\nLive in a Hiding Place is th\nthird song to be taken from\nIdlewild's album The Remote\nPart. From Woody Roomble's articulate vocals to the mellow,\nbut infectious guitar, this song\nis up there with some of the\nbest from greats like REM. A world apart from the raw sound\nof Captain, but highly recommended all the same. Let's just\nhope Alex Grant will be able to\ncontinue where Bob Fairfoul\n(ex-bassist) left off.\n4/5 Chris\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk If I was me, which I am - it is very important to confirm that!\n\n"

    "content": "INTERNATIONAL FELIX Bangladeshi Society hosted its biggest event to\ndate last Friday, a dinner in support of \"Bitan\",\na charity based in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Over\n200 guests attended, including students and\ngraduates from many other universities as well\nas old-timers from Bangladeshi and Bengali professional associations. Bitan works to 'Empower\nWomen Through Technology'; training women in\nBangladesh in usable computer skills (DoC\nwatch out!), so that they may work and provide\nfor their family. This enable ment is crucial for\nwomen who are divorced or widowed and have\nno source of income. These development initiatives have tangible effects, and should be\nbrought to a wider audience at institutions like\nImperial, broadening our collective experience.\nTo the sound of monsoon rain Sachin, the\ntabla maestro, set a thundering atmosphere for\nthe evening. Israt Alam then gracefully wooed\nthe crowd, performing a classical form of dance\nknown as 'Kathak' to an instrumental number\nby Junoon. Poetry followed, notably by\nShabnam Parkar of Poetry Society who eloquently vocalise d the charity's hopes and as pi rations. The audience was then wowed with a superb high-energy salsa number act by\nShahnoun and Catherine. Before the\nclapping/swooning ceased, food was on the\ntable to appease the hungry crowd, kindly pro-Banq-la desk iS oc\nZone, to tell strange stories and eat chocolate.\nThe night was a success thanks to the attitude\nof the audience and the kind support of the\nBengali community. The evening was filmed by\nBangla TV, so many mothers are eagerly awaiting the airing, hoping to see their offspring on\nthe box! Ticket sales alone raised \u00a31440, with\nmore to be added from the collection boxes.\nThanks to all who helped with the organising!\nShamim Rahman, President,Bangladeshi Soc\n(Heavy editing has occurred, so any omissions\nare on the cat's shoulders...

From this point\nonwards, our guests were subjected to improvised acts from members of the audience,\nincluding bizarre impersonations of break dancing to singing games known as \"Antakshari\".

Nay, we are happy,\nfor our contingency plan seems a lot more fun: we hold you to ran-som, setting our resident bigots\nand dim-wits, Baz, Jade and JeanMarie, to investigate a new country each week.\nDetails of which country they'll\nbe unleashed on will be in the previous Felix, so you'll have a week\nto preserve the good name of your\ncountry from vitriolic prejudice.\nWe'll give you a couple of week's grace, as we weren't expecting an\nimmediate response from you and\nbecause we dislike the task of getting the bigots rabid (phlegm all\nover the place). However, we do\nneed copy, so please write to us.\nHow about an African country next\nweek, for example Nigeria?\nWe dislike another proposal,\nnamely that we invent countries,\nfor we rather fear that Middleearth would surface all too soon,\nand that the rest of the year would\ninclude too much arguing about\nrain shadows in Mordor and things\nof that ilk.\nDiary\nThere's a festival of \"exploratory\nmusic from Portugal\" going on this\nmonth, aka Atlantic Waves. It's on\nat various venues, (Cargo, the ICA\nand the Purcell room amongst o th ers) and includes a set by Lux DJs,\n\"Lisbon's best club\"; Fado (bluesy\nPortuguese traditional music,\nbelieved to have African roots) by\nMariza and Lulu Pena and a couple of Jazz sets too. It looks as\nthough it'll be worth further investigation... For more info.-www.atlantic waves. org.uk\nAs we're dealing with that part\nof the world, we can warmly recommend Hable con ella [Talk to\nher], by Pedro Almodovar. This\ntouching, trag i comic film has\nbeen out for a while, and might\nneed some tracking down,\nalthough we saw it this weekend.\nWorth it for the score alone, it also\nfeatures some great acting from\nthe two male leads (Dario\nGrandinetti and Javier Camara), a cameo by Geraldine Chaplin\n(daughter of Charlie) as well as a very funny black and white erotic\nsub-film. NB: Contains bull-fight-ing scenes.\nAnother film that's piqued our\ncuriosity is Abouna - Our Father,\nby Mahamet Saleh Haroun (Chad)\nshowing at the ICA between the\n22nd and 30th of Nov. We can\nonly vouch that the music is likely\nto be great, as the soundtrack is\nby Ali Farka Toure, a brilliant\nMalian musician. Extra info from\nwww.ica.org.uk\nAhoy there my roving buccaneers! One thing which you\nmay have already discovered is\nthat British news doesn't provide enough info, about your\nhome berth, unless there's a disaster. No doubt you keep up\nthrough a local website, but one\ngreat source is the BBC World\nService. Broadcasting in many\nlanguages all over the globe\nfrom Bush House, (on the\nStrand near LSE), it will keep\nyou up to date with the world.\nFor the whole experience it's worth listening to the radio;\nwww. bbc. co. uk/world service will give you more details on the\nfrequencies, as well as the text\nversions of the reports. From\n15:00 to 22:00, it's on 9410\nkHz for example.\nFor the Brits, I hasten to add\nthat Britain is better than many\ncountries others will doubtless\nthink of; but it is more insular\n(by definition for a start) than\nseveral other European co un tries.

    "content": "* I \u2022 m FELIX COLUMN05 Clinical Play 2002 - Arcadia\nForget the Freshers Plays, the musical and the\nSpring Term 'BIG' production. The ICSM clinical play is the true highlight in the Drama\nSociety's calendar. Produced, acted and\ndirected in by primarily clinical students, it\nconcentrates on the essence of the plot, using\nexperienced cast members, and comparatively\nsparse sets, so the talent of the society shows\nmost effectively.\nThis year's production, Arcadia lived up to\nthe reputed high standards, and indeed,\nexceeded expectations. The most hardened\ncynic was convinced that he wasn't paying\n(excessively) to sit in his own lecture theatre.\nWith great flair, the props and scenery were\ndisplayed to provide a background for Tom\nStoppard's time travelling masterpiece, which\naddresses major questions of art, science, and\nhistory and how they intersect.\nThe play is set, in its entirety, in a single\nroom, overlooking a garden, at Sidley Park, an\nEnglish country estate. The scenes alternate\nbetween the 20th century and the 19th, until\nthey finally converge at the end. In one period\n- 1809 to 1812 - it is the residence of Lord\nand Lady Croom, Lady Thomasina Coverly (a teenage mathematical prodigy) and her tutor,\nSeptimus Hodge, amongst others. In the pre s ent, an author, Hannah Jarvis, a scholar,\nBernard Nightingale, and the scientist (and\none of the children of the house) Valentine are\nthe main figures. Objects, letters, notebooks,\nfurniture - appear in both, bridging time.\nThe plot is catalysed by Thomasina's impending womanhood, a source of tension\nthat rises as the play proceeds. Septimus is a natural object for her affections, but he meanwhile is involved in another affair. Adding to\nthe complexity an unseen Byron, who went to\nuniversity with Septimus, visits Sidley Park.\nThe confusion of who did what (and, in\nsome cases, to whom) work to great comedic\nand dramatic effect. Much of the fun comes\nfrom the alternate scenes in the present, as\nthese characters try to understand from the\nfew clues left what exactly happened in the\npast. Bernard is trying to prove that Byron was\ninvolved in a duel with poet in residence Ezra\nChater, explaining Byron's unexplained two-year absence from England. Hannah becomes\nobsessed with a mysterious hermit who lived\non the property (and, to her great satisfaction,\nmanages to prove Bernard mistaken).\nHaving comparatively few characters,\nArcadia is indeed very challenging to act in, as\nit lasts for almost three hours, and this alone\ndisplayed the calibre of the cast. Andrew\nWheeler positively shone as the utterly repulsive Bernard, Thomasina, was ably transformed to a thirteen year old by Sarah Hull,\nthe other teen, Katherine Sharpey being equally convincing. Valentine, (played by Tom\nSterling) one of the more difficult parts to carry\noff, in my opinion, showed his true colours as\nan actor, as he has become remarkably at ease\non stage since his casting in Hamlet, his\nchemistry with Hannah (Gina WestonPetrides) being one of the more intriguing\naspects of the subplot.\nIn conclusion - if you haven't seen it this\ntime, you have seriously missed out! Do your\nbest to make it to next year's clinical play to\nsee the real talent in the Drama Society.\nSajini Wijetilleka\nappealing in the\nat the Union Comedy Club Martinez's wisdom and her impish delight in shocking her\naudience wins them over immediately - The Observer\nSince starting her stand up career in 1999, Francesca has\nrocketed to comedy stardom, winning The Daily Telegraph\nOpen Mic Award which resulted in performances at the\nprestigious Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

What do you do\nnext?\nFor Jason Pierce, the answer is\nto sack the rest of your band\nmembers and start again.\nIncredibly for him, this didn't end\nin disaster as Spiritualized followed up with the wonderful Let It\nCome Down which was voted by\nXFM listeners as the best album of\n2001, ahead of perennial\nfavourites Radiohead and Muse.\nThe sacked members mean-while, decided to form their own\nband. Starting in 2001 with the\nhalf-decent The Carnivorous Lunar\nActivities, their second offering\nfinds them in a rawer northern\nsoul guise.\nThe main guise that the tracks\nhere take are quiet verses making\nway for a cannon of fuzz and riffs.\nOpener A Grave To Go, emits a blues vibe that John Spencer used\nto do so well whereas Centre Of\nThe Universe sees an eerie backing and anxious \"Can't you feel\nthis?\" whispering s morphin g into\na tumultuous and commanding\nreprise of \"Come to me\". Standout\ntrack Burning Stars starts off as a coffee table instrumental before\nonce again the bite kicks in,\nrecalling the swagger of Slide\nAway by Oasis married to a menacing riff.\nThe most frustrating problem is\nthat the lead singer sounds as if\nhe's holding back his full vocal\nrange, and some songs are aching\nto be let loose in a wave of sound\nto turn them from ordinary rock\nsongs into widescreen epics. They\nobviously want to get away from\nSpiritualized comparisons\n(although you wouldn't imagine\nPierce to be as tortuous a boss as\nMark E Smith), but surely it would\nbe best for them to go with their\ninstincts.\nThe likes of Muse, JJ72 and\nThe Music have shown that you\ncan produce big-sounding tunes\nwithout sounding overbearing.\nThe tracks here that benefit from\nthat freedom only serve to show\nhow the other few could have\nsounded. Gravity's Pull is an\nexample, a plaintive acoustic\nstrum-along with a strained countrified drawl vocal which only\ncomes into its own after 5 minutes\nwhen the orchestral sweep blows\nin, finally treating the track to the\npomp it deserves. Overall, a decent if unremarkable offering;\nyou somehow doubt that Jason\nPierce will be losing any sleep\nover his decision. Deepesh\nSafri Duo\nEpisode II - The Remix Edition\n2/5\nHi, our name is Safri Duo, you\nmay remember us from such\nillustrious second rate dance\ntunes as Played Alive (The Bongo\nSong) and well, that's all we've\ndone that has been in anyway\nnoteworthy really. What's that\nyou say, you don't remember us?\nBut we provided a tiny part of the\nsoundtrack to your cheesy Ibizan\nhedonism a few summers ago,\nwe are the original purveyors of\ncomedy-bongo-Amazon ian Ab(un)original house. How can\nyou have forgotten us already?\n\"Because you're shit!!\", the world\ncries back in unison.\nIt is no exaggeration to say that\nThe Bongo Song is absolutely the\nbest song on the entire album, If\nyou actually remember it then\nyou'll realize what a sad state of\naffairs this is. Every song, and\nthat really means every song, not\njust most songs, contains at least\none bongo solo, some contain\nmore and some others contain\nnothing EXCEPT bongos. This\nreally should have been called\nPlayed to Death (The Bongo\nAlbum).\nAmazingly for a \"dance\"\nalbum, there are hardly any electronic effects anywhere, it is literally made up of bongos and other\nvarious percussion instruments\n(and a digeridoo, oh yes. If anyone can tell me the last time a digeridoo was heard on an album\nNOT made by Rolf Harris they\ndeserve a prize). OK, they may\nbe synthesized but there are no\nsilly bleeps or blatant electronic\nbasslines. It does actually sound\nlike it was played in real life and\nthen just arranged digitally.\nWhich is quite disturbing actually because, judging from the\nseverely pained expression on the\nface of the poor guy that played\nthem (as seen on the front cover),\nhe must have exploded about\nhalf way through recording.\nThe album is just about saved\nby a second CD of remixes by\npeople like Darude, Cosmic Gate\nand Riva who manage to inject\nsome life into what are essentially still-born songs, and move\nsome of them from half-arse d bongo-house into what we'll call\nplump-arse d techno-house terri-tory.

Scavengers\ncome regularly to the site and\nsome say they have found equipment worth thousands of pounds.\nMany of the cupboards and equipment thrown away are just simply\nnot produced these days and are\nworth a fortune, an antique (bring\ndown the roadshow I say)!\nSo what's going on? Intrigued I put on my detective hat, lit my\npipe and went to meet Alan Jones,\nestates and building manager for\nthe RSM project. In a nutshell:\n\"Over the next year, the RSM is\ngoing to be refurbished, with the\nDepartment of Earth Science and\nEngineering moving into the Aston\nWebb building, Department of\nMaterials moving into the\nGoldsmith Wing and Department\nof Environmental Science and\nTechnology moving to the top\nfloor\" - all very neat.\nThis has all been triggered by\nall the equipment - using my\nextensive deduction skills; not a long time.\nIt would seem that Departments\nhave been going through the var i the development of the Tanaka\nBusiness School which is using\nmost of the Goldsmith Wing. In\nfact this section was handed over\nto estates last Wednesday, giving\nonly until this Monday to clear out\no us rooms since July, picking out\nthings they want to keep and restoring them, for example rock\nspecimens. However it seems\ncrazy I said that no-one was\nemployed to help sell the waste -it's worth a fortune or indeed\ndonate it to charity. However Alan\nJones pointed out clearly that\n\"although everyone has done their\nbest to salvage antique items\nthere is just simply a lack of space\nto store things and a lack of time\nto go through the waste properly\".\nSo what can I say? Well I got my\ntrolley out and now the RSM CSC\nhave a vintage and very classy filing cabinet (with filing folders!)\nwhich will be used for achieves, a new seismograph mascot and\nsome old student files from the\n50s. If you fancy a new chair, filing cabinet or even a hard drive\nthen come and grab it! I have\nbeen informed that everyone is\nwelcome to the rubbish pile.\nWhat I want to know, is for a university claiming to be short of\nmoney - why it is allowing so\nmuch money to be thrown away?\nA case once again for a lack of\nadministration, organisation and\ntime? I'd like to see the balance\nsheet for this one...\nCarina Fearnley\nFor the first st It imf e ever J Da V in lci'E x qh ange( jr inc in i ex per Da V in is going be floated!

And\nnot necessarily in an\necclesiastical way.\nPage 18\nCoffee Break: we really\nintend you to read it\nwhile drinking coffee.\nPage 22\nr' Issue 1247\nF9 AW z REFERENCE\nCOLLECTION\nImperial College and\nScience Museum Libraries\nLecturers To Strike\nIn a ballot of its members (Felix 1243), the\nAssociation of University Teachers has voted\n75% in favour of a strike this Thursday.\nThe AUT are protesting about the 'London\nweighting', the extra money awarded to university staff working in London to offset the\nhigher cost of living. The allowance stands at\n\u00a32134, but has remained fixed since 1992.\nMeanwhile, claim the AUT, London vice-chancellors enjoy \u00a316,000 extra per year\nover their counterparts outside the capital.\nThe unions rejected a3.5% salary increase\noffer, and are instead campaigning for an\nallowance of \u00a34000.\nSeveral other staff unions - NATFHE,\nAmicus and Unison - have also called on\ntheir members to strike on 14th November.\nThe number of lecturers to walk out is\nunclear, but technical and administrative\nstaff both in College and the students' union\nare also covered by the call to strike.\nThe National Union of Students (NUS) and\nWill lecture theatres stand empty?\nUniversity of London Union (ULU) are both\npublically supporting the action, with the\nLondon weighting for student funding one of\nULU's main campaigns. It is hoped that any\nmovement on the weighting for staff may\nhighlight the additional cost to students taking courses in London. Meanwhile, the AUT\nexplicitly states that the association aims not\n\"to adversely affect students\" with its strike\naction.\nIt is thought that some critical College staff\nmay be involved in the strike action including\nsecurity officers. Head of Security Ken Weir is\nhoping to obtain permission for his staff to\ndisregard the call to strike in order to provide\nfire and security cover, though he acknowledged that he had no way of knowing how\nmany of his staff were in the appropriate\nunions or were planning to strike.\nUnion President Sen Ganesh said he was\n\"deeply concerned\" that teaching and Union\nactivities may be disrupted by the strike, but\nas with the rest of College, there seems to be\nmuch uncertainty about the number of staff\nto walk out next week.\nThe AUT has stated that the strike may still\nbe averted if employers negotiate. AW\nUnion Shutdown\nThe Union building in South\nKensington will be largely evacuated on Saturday as a result of\nthe Remembrance Day events at\nthe Royal Albert Hall.\nThe annual ceremony in\nremembrance of those from the\narmed forces who died in action,\nincluding the two world wars, is\nattended by the Queen and other\nmembers of the royal family. The\nUnion building in Beit\nQuadrangle is usually closed\nwhen royals attend the hall in\norder to stage counter-terrorism\nmeasures. Prince Consort Road\nand Kensington Gore will also\nclose, while nearby residences\nare closely monitored. In the\npast, parked cars and even\nchained-up bikes have been\nremoved by police as they may\nconceal \"hostile devices\".\nWhile police will occupy the\nroof of the Beit building, they will\nnot be armed, according to\nCollege's Head of Security Ken\nWeir.\nStudent activities in the Union\nbasements will be unaffected and\nthe bars will be open as usual.\nAW What you won't be allowed to do\nA new column on College poli-tics.

The Datsuns though\nare less thrash y, with more of a Led Zeppelin feel to them. This\npunchy debut album is high\noctane stuff. The first tune on the\nself titled album Sittin' Pretty\nborrows heavily from a Lenny\nKravitz riff, which is okay with\nme because it's a catchy guitar\nlead rock tune.\nThe next two tunes, MF From\nHell (The M rhymes with brother\nand the F with tucker) and Lady\nare also fast paced, vivacious, in\nyour face tunes without let up.\nJust by listening to them, the\namount of energy they inject into\ntheir music exhaust you. What\nWould I Know, track five, is probably my favourite on the album,\nreminiscent of Black Rebel\nMotorcycle Club, a tune that\ngathers strength as it marches on\nplaying out for over 5 minutes,\nwhich is time thoroughly well\nspent.\nThe next track is their recently\nreleased single that reached No.\n25 in the UK singles chart, In\nLove, a quality tune and one of\nthe best on the album with\ncatchy lyrics and good background singing. Though that was\nthe single released, there are others on the album that could easily have been singles, being of the\nsame style and quality.\nThe Datsuns have just finished\ntheir UK tour, and that's a pity,\nbecause if they play live anything\nhalf as good as it is in here, then\nit should be a brilliant gig. Look\nout, The Datsuns have arrived!\nToby B Various\nTwice as Nice Presents MOBO 2002\n2/5\n\\ 4\nThis CD needs no explanation for,\nit's an amalgamation of tracks\nselected from the nominees at\nthe 2002 MOBO awards, a selection from the cream of young\nurban talent. Talent being the\noperative word, after listening to\nthis CD I would not want to know\nhow young urban mediocre\nsounds, as this album turned out\nto be a major disappointment.\n'How can you complain?' I hear\nyou say. 'There's Ashanti,\nBeverley Knight and Missy Elliot\non there, not to mention the\nSugababes and The Streets'. I'm sorry to tell you this, but the\npresence of respected, talented\nartists on the compilation does\nnothing to lessen the impact of\nsome shockingly bad, insipid\nnonsense that crops up at regular\nintervals. And precisely which\ntracks are that bad, well let's start with the first disc.\nDisc One starts off with what is\nprimarily competent, relatively\nmainstream RnB. Think MC\nRomeo of permanently topless\ndisposition, and his lyrically-chal-leng ed Romeo Dunn, along with\nMiss Dynamite's brassy funk\nsing-along It Takes More. This is\nwhat I call talent. The opening\ntracks are strong and well put\ntogether. Steve Sutherland's mixing makes this the perfect party\nCD as the tracks blend seamless-ly into one another.\nTop tracks include newcomers\nBig Bruvaz and the mindless, yet\ncatchy Nu Flow, the permanently\ncold (is it just me or do they\nnever seem to wear any clothes,\njust underwear?) Liberty X with\nGof to Have Your Love and the\nfabulous Black Twang rap on the\nfunky Trixstar. Another highlight,\nthe groovy What's Luv from\nAshanti and Fat Joe, and the\nbhangra remix of Misteeq's Roll\nOn. The tunes are not new, that's for certain, as this is a set of\nwhat are supposedly the highs of\nthe last year.\nThe dirge begins here. We have\nnumerous pointless remixes of\nwhat were essentially good\nsongs, e.g. Oh Baby by Rhianna\nand Fallin' by Alicia Keys, where\nbeats detract from the melody of\nthe original pieces. There are\nthen some genuinely awful\nsongs, which can't really be\ncalled songs because there are\nminimal musical merits in them,\nand you can't dance to them\nwithout looking like a deformed\nchicken. These include 3rd Edge\nand the sleazy slime Keith Sweat\n- with / Want You as well as\nLurine Cato Feat. Royalty's We'll\nGet Thru It and Trina's No\nPanties. And the second disc is\nby far the lamest CD on sale in\nthe shops, with only Daniel\nBedingfield holding the flag of\ngood taste. The garage section is\nparticularly inaccessible - if you\ncan't rap along, or dance to it, it's got to be a bad thing on a party\nCD right?\nSajini\nSingles\nVanessa Carlton\nDay\nOrdinar\nThis is the follow up song\nthe very good A Thousa,\n| Miles, y 'know the piano playing woman travelling on the\nback of a lorry. Ordinary Day\ndoesn't really digress from the\nsame format. There is still\nplenty of piano playing with\nvery powerful string accompaniment. It's a bit of a cheesy\nsong about following dreams\nit's got plenty of energy\ning ability factor is high,\nside note, has anyone\nseen Michelle Branch and\nVanessa Carlton in the same\nroom together? I swear they\ncould be the same person.\n4/5 Oscar\nSugababes - Stronger/Angels\nwith Dirty Faces\nThe Sugababes are not as fit\nas their pop pier rivals Atomic\nKitten but they make better\nmusic. Now we've got that out\nthe way, let's talk music. This\nou ble A side will do them no\nat all. Both songs are\nt girl power but are a lot\nmore street about it as\nopposed to the long forgotten\nSpice Girls. Stronger is a standard pop ballad, slow with as in gable chorus and good har-on ies. There's the standard\nbit where she wails a bit\nRound Round. However\n.ong doesn't really know\nto end, with just\nfading away.\nAngels with Dirty Faces\nmuch more upbeat. Then\nmore of the rap/singing thi\nthat's heard frequently in thi:\nir and of pop. A heavily pro-track which I think is\nof an album track, it's bit too forgettable. These\no songs aren't as good as\ntheir previous singles but\nthey're doing well.\nOscar\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk Richard of York gave battle in vain\n\n"

The new Harry Patter film arrives He he! Now is the time for us all to admit that\nwe enjoy Harry Potter even if it is written for 9\n- 11 year olds. I 've seen men in smart suits\nwith briefcases sitting on the tube totally\nengrossed and I'm sure I'm not the only wit-ness. This website is fun; you can enter as a muggle or as a witch/wizard and you get a different site. Other than the standard options\nthat you would expect from a Bloomsbury site\n- introduction to Harry Potter, order the books,\nreviews, biography, there are some more interesting added extras. If you enter as a muggle\nthere is a glossary of all the terms used in the\nseries, including all the spells used.\nAparecium! Hmm, didn't work. But I think it is\nbetter to enter as a witch/wizard, although\nthere is a test before you can enter - there is\npassword you have to guess, don't worry it\nshouldn't tax your brains too much but I won't spoil your fun and tell you what it is. As a witch/wizard there is a Screensaver to download (for Macs or PCs), it may take a little time\nwith an ordinary connection and it's not exactly a high tech piece of artwork but fun none the less. However, my favourite extra is that you\ncan send howlers. These range from 'You\nSlytherin toad rat' to 'Do your homework and\ntidy your room'. You email them to anyone you\nlike or don't, as the case may be. There are\nalso owl ers, which are nice, including 'happy\nbirthday' and 'my friend fancies you'!\nAnyway, with the new book and new film\nout soon, maybe it's time for you all to brush\nup on your magic speak.\nwww. lilo as aT i bury magazine. tani/ harri j patter Art far them are mature A website for anyone who enjoys art, photography or museums, or is perhaps travelling and\nfeels they should do something vaguely educational while they are there. A comprehensive\nsite of art/photography galleries and museums\nworldwide, from our very own, lovely Great\nBritain, to Israel or Australia. This does not just\ncover the straightforward traditional galleries\neither, there is information on one man in Tel\nAviv who produces pictures and sculptures\nusing meat, liver, blood and dead bugs. Well\nit's better than freezing them and covering\nthem in chocolate (see Felix 1245 if you're\nlost).\nThis site would also be useful for anyone\nlooking for an interesting picture because there\nare quite a few rather gorgeous photographs\nand art pieces that can be saved. I, for one,\nhave picked up a new background for my desktop that is much nicer than the ones that\nMicrosoft provides.\nThere is only one slight problem with this\nsite. Sure, it is straightforward to use - divided\ninto countries, easy to track down specific\ninformation and easy to browse. But, half of it\nis in French. Now you are intelligent people\nand as such I can't believe that will be much of\na problem.\nSo if you like to find out about art galleries\nand photography exhibitions anywhere in the\nworld or maybe just want a new background I would suggest having a quick nosey around\nhere.\nIt's a bit too orange really (trust me it is). I prefer kiwis or mangoes but not lychees.\nTerm of the Week: Network\nImperial has one, my friends have one in\ntheir house, in fact, I'm beginning to think\nthese things are pretty darn useful.

In Local-Area\nNetworks the computers are geographically\nclose, whereas in Wide-Area Networks they\nare further apart. Other types include\nCampus-Area, Metropolitan-Area and HomeArea Networks.\nCalling all budding journalists.\nSince my coursework is now starting to\nmount up I could really do with a little help\nwriting the best web site review page the\nworld has ever seen.

    "content": "BOOK REVIEWS FELIX NICK\nHORN\nThis is a relaxing easy read, with\ncaptivating characters and a storyline that bounces along to the end.\nEssentially it is story of a married\ncouple entering a joint mid life cri-sis, Kate finds herself having an\naffair and David has a complete\npersonality transplant. The title is a result of the conscience struggle\nthat Kate has - is she a good per-son? As a GP she considers her\nwork to be 'good', she believes that\nshe is a 'good' mother and when\nshe compares herself to the original\nDavid she can believe herself to be\nHow to be Good\nNick Hornby\na complete saint. But why then is\nshe having an affair and risking it\nall? David is an embittered, cynical\nindividual who delights in hating\neveryone and everything. His\nfavourite hobby, though, is irritating\nKate, and in one of his many\nattempts to annoy her he goes to\nget his bad back treated, but not by\na certified practitioner. He finds a small sign indicating that bad\nbacks could be sorted out in one\nsession for a single fee. David does-n't believe that it will work but he\ndoes know it will wind Kate up. He\nis more than a little surprised when\nhe meets the healer, a man calling\nhimself DJ GoodNews, and returns\nwith his back healed after years of\npain.\nDJ GoodNews is someone whom\nwe would all like to know for novelty value, but at a distance, quite\na large distance. His crazy ideas on\nhow to be good completely alter\nDavid's outlook on life and result in\na number of bizarre schemes to\nimprove the lives of those in the\nlocal community. Whilst David\nundergoes total character alteration\nKate is left wondering where she\nwent wrong, she knows for definite\nthat her life is going completely off\nthe rails when she ends up pretending to live at home for her children's benefit but actually living in\na friends flat. She arrives before the\nchildren get up and leaves after\nthey go to bed, despite this being\nexhausting and a little silly, she\nreally enjoys the time to herself.\nThis is a rather different\napproach to the breakdown of mar-ri age, as well as a study on what\n'good' really means. Is anyone really 'good'? Probably not, we all do\nthings for selfish reasons from time\nto time.\nJenny Lewis\nPenguin Books; ISBN: 0140287019\ntony pats om man and boy\nTony Parsons has really excelled\nhimself with this book, a tender\npicture of the love between father\nand son. He studies the relationship from both sides and the result\nis a set of characters that you learn\nto love yourself. Now, I'm not the\ncrying sort but with this book I found the odd tear making its way\ndown my cheek: Parsons manages\nto capture love and put it on the\npage in a way that I 've not seen\nbefore.\nHarry's father is a hero, a war\nhero and he's got the medal to\nprove it, but he is also the sweet-Man and Boy\nTony Parsons\nest most gentle man you can i mag ine. Harry admires him and yet he\nis also intimidated by him, he\nwants his own son to respect him\nin the same way but knows it will\nnever happen because Harry and\nhis father are very different. This is\nnot just about paternal love.\nParsons compares the love of his\nsweetheart, his wife, with the\nphysical love with Siobhan, his\none night stand and eventually\nwith the love between two people\nwho are really right for each other.\nWritten in first person, this novel\nbegins with an idealistic impression of his life, married to the love\nof his life with a child, whom they\nboth adore. But there are cracks in\nthis perfection and they culminate\nwith a one night fling on his part\nwhich destroys their relationship.\nHis wife, Gina, gave up a high flying career in Japan as a translator\nin order to marry him and bring up\nhis son, but with his one night\nstand she totally loses faith in the\nrelationship and returns to Japan.\nThis leaves Harry to bring up his\nson and he stumbles from one difficulty to another. By this point he\nhas lost his job so is also increasingly faced with financial problems.\nThis novel is not all unhappiness,\nworries and complications, it has a sharp, witty tone that provides\nchuckles throughout as a welcome\nrelief from the intensity of the story\nline. All in all, this novel thoroughly\ndeserves the attention and praise it\nhas received and is certainly one\nthat I recommend, I just hope that\nMan and Wife and One For My\nBaby are as good, otherwise I'm about to waste my money.\nJenny Lewis\nHarperCollins; ISBN: 0006512135\nHELP!

If\nthey're spending money on alcohol,\nthey won't be spending it in HMV,\nand perhaps that will mean the\ncharts will be free of S Club Juniors.\nSo, we should be promoting alcohol\nmore heavily to the under-16's. There could be an advertising campaign like that badly dubbed Kinder\nEgg advert of several years ago...\nbuy\nThe Scene: A Supermarket. A woman is standing\nin the drinks aisle\nwith her three disgusting children.\nWoman: Right, shut up, and I you something.\nPrecocious Child 1: I'm hyperactive\nand thirsty - I want a drink full of\nartificial colourings!\nIrritating Child 2: I'm too happy - I want a natural depressant!\nUgly Child 3: And I want a surprise!\nWoman: Artificial colourings, a nat-Booze!\nural depressant... and a surprise...\nall in one... it's not possible... it's not possible...\nAnnouncer: NEW VODKA SUNNY\nDELIGHT!\nWoman: What a good idea!

Woman: The surprise is that I haven't given you a good wallop for\nbeing so bloody\nimpertinent.\nWhat a rubbish sur-Ugly Child 3\np rise. Woman: OK then - you were adopt-ed. Surprise!\nGetting kids into drinking also\nmeans that they should be well\nprepared for university life. Students\nwould come to Imperial with a greater alcohol tolerance, which\ncan only mean more money into the\ncollege coffers. And perhaps we'd see less vomiting in the union.\nWhat better way to finish a fun\nnight out than with your arms\naround a toilet bowl, retching so\nhard you can almost see your own\nintestines? While feeding your new\nceramic friend your previous meal,\nyou can find yourself asking questions - like, was there ever a man\ncalled Armitage Shanks? What is\nthe Ideal Standard?

    "content": "FELIX SPORT27 Boys, Girls and\nShuttlecocks\nPicture the scene: it's Halloween, the middle of the\nnight, the wind is whistling\nthrough the trees, the shadows\nare dancing and Minna wants\nchocolate. It doesn't get much\nmore scary. But why is it in a sports report?\nThe night started off normally\nenough; most of the team, tired\nand hungry, stood outside the\nUnion waiting for Gavin, our\never-punctual captain. We were\nabout to embark on the first leg\nof our quest for mixed doubles\nglory against the might of Royal\nHolloway. Amazingly, despite a distinct lack of preparedness\nand going against all past\nrecords, we arrived early for the\nmatch, and could have carried\nout a proper warm-up. Could\nhave. Instead, I digested my\nlarge Burger King meal, Minna\nheaded for the vending\nmachines and Gavin chatted up\nthe opposite team's captain.\nAnd so to the match. Royal\nHolloway had only managed to\nsecure two courts, the other half\nof the gym being occupied by\nscary people in black suits doing\nwhat looked like an elaborate\nform of the Hokey Kokey. This\narrangement left me - a a lowly\nthird coupler - free to watch the\nfirst two matches. On paper,\nthese should have been the best\ntwo matches - first vs. first and\nsecond vs. second. They didn't disappoint. The girl in the Royal\nHolloway first couple was the\nbest female we've ever seen play\nin a ULU league - quick, strong\nand clever, and she added entertainment value by abusing herself in a variety of languages.\nDespite being up against super-woman, our first couple, Minna\nand Kee, managed to pull\nthrough three hard games,\nshowing excellent resilience and\ndetermination having lost the\nfirst one. Watching this game I suddenly realised how mixed\ndoubles should be played. Now,\nif only I could do it.\nUnfortunately, on the other court\nBelinda and Chan struggled\nagainst the second couple, and\nlost two hard-fought games.\nGavin and I then continued\nthis losing streak by losing to the\nthird couple, mainly due to my\ninability to serve and Gavin's inability to hit anything in the\ncourt. But he had just had his\nracquet re-strung, so we might\nlet him off. Meanwhile, Minna\nand Kee demonstrated their\nsuperiority by polishing off the\nthird couple without even breaking sweat and Belinda and Chan\ncouldn't overcome super woman. So Royal Holloway were 3-2 up\nwith four games to play. Onto\ncourt stepped Gavin and I, the\nantithesis of the ideal doubles\nteam, desperately needing to\nbeat their second couple. It was\na match to end all matches. One\nmember from each team was\nseverely handicapped by the\ntemporary loss of one ankle and\nI earned myself the incongruous\nnickname Miss Whiplash - I'm a good girl, I am - due to a propensity for whacking my leg\nquite hard with my racquet,\nwhenever Iar sed something up,\nwhich was quite often. Yes, I still have the bruises. No, you\ncan't see them. Anyway, we\nmanaged to come out on top\nand needed to win two of the\nlast three to win the match.\nObviously, Minna and Kee won\nwith the minimum of bother.\nEqually obviously, Gavin and I didn't even get a point against\ntheir number ones. And so it\ncame down to Belinda and\nChan. They'd managed to cream\nthe RH pair in the first game,\n15-2, and we all waited expectantly for them to wrap up the\nmatch. Unsurprisingly, they did-n't. Well, not straight away. In\nkeeping with the night's sense of\ndrama and excitement, they did-n't win it until 17-15 in the\nthird. A truly stunning victory,\nespecially considering the added\npressure of everyone watching,\nand it being after 11pm. Our departure from Royal\nHolloway was slightly delayed\nby Gavin's ineptitude in getting\ndressed - well, he's more used to\nthe other way round. This paled\ninto insignificance though compared to the delay caused by\nbeing locked in the car park.\nEveryone else had disappeared,\nand we were confronted by a big\ngate with an extremely large\npadlock. We thought about ram-raiding it, but then reconsidered\nat the thought of the already\ndilapidated state of the Union\nminibus fleet. So off set Gavin\nand I, through the woods of\nEgham, trying to find security.\nWhen we eventually found\nthem, we were further delayed\nby their disbelief that such a thing could happen, and by the\nsecurity guard's insistence that I should celebrate Celtic's victory\nover Blackburn with him, just\nbecause I happened to ask the\nresult with a vaguely Scottish\naccent. It shames me even now.\nWith our knight in shining\narmour on the way, we headed\nback to the minibus to wait for\nour liberation. Finally the guard\ncame and opened the gate. And,\nof course, the bus wouldn't start. And when it did, and we\nwere on our way, inevitably, the\nM4 was closed. So the tubes\nhad stopped and everyone had\nto be dropped at their door. The\nlast of us got home at 2a m.I'm tired just writing about it. But\nwe won. Hurrah.

    "content": "FELIX PROFILE: STEVE BUSCEMI Owing to the lack of actual content, we thought\nwe'd include random people's rants. Well,\nactually its a thing we're going to do every once\nin a while in a vain attempt to entertain you lot.\nBut anyway, here's the first, written by a man\nwith a scary penchant for Steve Buscemi...\nSteve Buscemi. Skinny. Scary. Sublime?\nPale, we a sly and intense, widely recognised\nbut not so widely known, Steve Buscemi's unmistakable voice and countenance have seen\nhim cast as the peripheral oddball in a plethora\nof nineties movies. However, his success is\ndown more to his unique brand of character acting than mere appearance; consistently stealing\nthe limelight from the lead actors he supports,\nhe has carved a unique niche for himself in\nmodern cinema.\nPerhaps the most pertinent reason for his relative anonymity is Buscemi's propensity for\nmaking so-called 'indie' movies, although many\nof these, (such as Fargo and Reservoir Dogs),\nhave managed to eke their way in to the main-stream. Despite having starred in such\nHollywood money machines as Armageddon\nand Con Air, he is known to prefer smaller, more\nindependent projects to bigger studio ones,\nwhich 'feel more like a job'. His employment as\na good luck charm by many an independent\ndirector has led to the epithet 'King of the\nIndies'.\nBorn Brooklyn in 1957, Buscemi was to be a ice-cream truck driver, fireman and like so many\nactors before him, a stand-up comic before hitting the 'big time' in 1986 with Parting Glances.\nIn a film directed by Bill Sherwood (who was\ntragically to succumb to AIDS four years later)\nhe played an HIV-positive rock star, impressively outperforming the leads. Buscemi went on to\nstar in fourteen more movies that decade, but it\nwas not until 1992, and the release of Reservoir\nDogs, that he would fully infiltrate the public's consciousness - playing a would-be-diamond-thief who refuses to tip waitresses. In an ironic\ntwist, he would later appear in Pulp Fiction as a waiter.\nThe remainder of the nineties heralded a slew\nof critically acclaimed performances, such as his\nrole in as Mr Shhh in Things to Do in Denver\nWhen You're Dead. 1990 and Miller's Crossing\nsaw the commencement of his long-running\nrelationship with the Cohen brothers, having\nappeared in four of their productions to date,\nincluding the seminal Fargo and The Big\nLebowski, where he played a bungling kidnapper and bowling-obsessed ex-surfer respectively.\nBuscemi also made several forays behind the\ncamera, writing and directing Trees Lounge in\n1996, a semi-autobiographical yarn about what\nhis life would have been like had he not become\nan actor. The film was received warmly, if not\necstatically, by critics.\nOutside of film-making, Buscemi is seen as an\naffable and sociable personality. He returned to\nhis old fire depot after September 11th, and\nanonymously worked 12 hour shifts looking for\nsurvivors and helping clear the rubble. His private life is not without controversy, however, last\nyear he was stabbed in the throat, head and\narm during a barroom brawl which also involved\nVince Vaughn.\nBuscemi has been compared in the past to\nPeter Lorre (Casablanca, 20,000 Leagues\nUnder the Sea), and not without reason; there\nare many similarities between the pair. Although\nSteve has had leading roles, it is while supporting others that he has made his name, probably\ndue to his skill in playing marginal is ed eccentrics. This should not be taken to suggest\na limited range: he effortlessly manages to convey a great depth of emotions, from all-con sum ing rage (Fargo) to stunned bemuse ment( Con\nAir). Recent releases show no decline in his acting prowess, in fact Ghost World (2001) earned\nnumerous plaudits as some of Buscemi's best\nwork yet. Although never likely to be an all-con-sum ing mega star, he was ranked 52nd in\nEmpire magazine's Top 100 Movie Stars of All\nTime, and continues to attract a strong cult fol-lowing.\nDavid\nSHALLOW HAL STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: DVD RELEASE: GWYNETH PALTROW, JACK BLACK THE FARRELLY BROS.121 OB MIN11 TH NOVEMBER Shallow Hal is probably the worst film I have ever\nhad the misfortune to waste valuable minutes of\nmy life tort u rou sly sitting through. For those of you\nsensible enough to avoid it thus far, the basic\npremise is that Hal (Black) loves pretty girls. I would like to tell you that it gets more complex, but\nsadly the title gives it all away. Constantly chasing\nafter beautiful women who are quite clearly so far\nout of his reach he'd have to launch an Apollo mis-sion, Hal whines on about how unlucky in love he\nis. Well, duh, of course you are, you arrogant, ugly,\nfat short little man. Comforted by his equally irritating friend, he spends a vast majority of this\nwaste of celluloid cracking on to models and scantily clad lovelies, who, for some reason, decline his\nslimy advances. Plenty more fish? Try another\npond. Utilising a highly dubious plot mechanism,\nHal suddenly sees the \"beauty within\" and falls for\nRosemary. Aside from being vomit-inducing\nHollywood pap, the story then goes on to show\nthat the beauty within Rosemary (Paltrow) is a skinny lollipop who happens to do charity work or\nsome such pathetic shit. After tedious picnic and\n\"love\" scenes, the Hal realises Rosemary has in\nfact eaten his girlfriend, and blah, blah, he doesn't love her any more. Frankly, I care not. The fact that\nHollywood dares to make a film about looking at\npersonality not looks, and then cast Paltrow, who\nrefused to even consider weight gain for the role, is\ndownright ridiculous. I'm not one to doubt that\nlooks are important, but why only for girls? This\nleads me to the main problem with the entire film\n- no eye candy for the girls. Just call me Shallow.\nLiz\nWHAT TO WATCH.... at the Movies: 28 Days Later...\n(Released 1st November, 18)\n...on TV: The Negotiator (Monday 11th November, Five, 21:00)\n...on Sky: The Dish (Tuesday 12th November, Premier, 20:00)\n...on DVD: Attack of the Clones (Released\n11th November, PG)\nIC CINEMA Tuesday 12th November\n18:00 - Spiderman\n20:30 - Men In Black II\nThursday 14th November\n18:00 - Men In Black II\n20:15 - Spiderman\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX07/ Sfe '/\nWORDS OF WISDOM FROM THE EDITORS... Bad news I'm afraid. Ever since Will caught me\nwith the Ladybird Little Book of Editing on my\ndesk he's decided that I need some help. So in\na clear move to disrupt my power base he's appointed a co-Films-editor. Of course, little\ndoes he realise that it will be a simple matter\nto bend her impressionable mind round to my\nincreasingly machiavelli an designs, as I'm sure\nyou'll see...\nSI\nTaped to my fridge is an article declaring that\nmy neck of the woods is now a designated\nmedia community - and is to be renamed\n\"Media Vale\". And clearly it is where you live\nnot what you know that now matters, as I too\nhave succumbed to the glamourous world of all\nthings communications. Which included heading off to my very first, exciting-sounding \"press\nscreening this week with your favourite (for\nthe moment...) film editor of Felix, the semi-usurped Simon. We had met for the usual,\nintensive brainstorming session that is the Felix\nEditors' meeting, and after vetting him thoroughly (well, asking him his opinion on the\nnew episodes of Star Wars...) I decided that I could probably put up with his megalomaniac\ntendencies for now. And who knows, he may\ncome in handy for my own nefarious plans...\nSo I agreed to accompany him to deepest,\ndarkest Soho gathering knowledge for you out\nthere in Studentville, lest your hard earned\nloans be wasted in the pursuit of media excel-len ce. And whilst the other writers there hid\nbehind a veil of cool detachment, we threw\nprofessional caution to the wind and immersed\nourselves fully in the film to really understand\nits motivation. Yes, I know - we really are committed and self-sacrificing. But thank us not,\nsimply join with us in our quest for world domination which begins right here, on the pages of\nFelix. Get involved, go to films for free, see your\nname in print, and give in to your inner desire\nto be omnipotent. What are we going to do\ntoday, Brain? Why, the same thing we always\ndo, Simon, try to take over the world.\nYour sweet, innocent new co-editor, Liz\n2 8 DAYS LATER... STARRING: DIRECTED BY: CERTIFICATE: RUNNING TIME: RELEASE DATE: GILLIAN MURPHY, NAD MIE HARRIS, CHRISTOPHER ECCLES T Q N DANNY BOYLE1 S113M IN1 ST NOVEMBER Well, I have been ranting about this movie for\nthree weeks now and have finally managed to\nsqueeze myself into a cinema to actually see it.\nAnd the long and the short of it is that you lot\nshould too. Where to start though?\nThe film opens in London at some generic\nanimal testing facility. Within the facility we see\nlots of mad monkeys (which, in my opinion, is\na sign of a great film. Every film should have a mad monkey) and a bunch of hapless animal\nrights protesters, who are of course duty bound\nto spring our simian friends from their evil cap-tors. Which is all very well, but these particular\nmad monkeys are particularly mad, due to a highly virulent man-made pathogen known as\nRAGE. So we can all see where this is going\nand indeed our first sighting of hero Jim (played\nsuperbly by Cillian Murphy) is when he wakes\nup from a coma (28 days later...) in a deserted\nhospital in the midst of a deserted London.\nFrom here on in it is easy to draw stylistic comparisons with Day of the Triffids, The Omega\nMan or even vintage Doctor Who episodes, as\nwell as the work of George A. Romero (as a big\nnod for fans of the zombie classics, there's even\na Bub character). But this is far more than a simple homage movie. It's far more than a zombie movie - in fact it's NOT a zombie movie.\nZombie's were a horror born out of the intense\nnuclear paranoia that existed in the 60's and\n70's. Instead it's a movie that deals with the\nparanoia of today - chemical and biological\nthreats - in the form of the terrifying \"Infected\".\nAs visions of the apocalypse go, this one is a blinder. Danny Boyle and company have been\nfamed in the past for an almost sage-like abi li The End is Very Fucking Nigh\nty to predict future trends and to have their collective finger firmly on the pulse of a generation\n(Trainspotting, Shallow Grave). This film in\nmany ways marks a return to form after the disappointment of The Beach and it strikes the\ncinemas just as public concern over biological\nthreats is beginning to spike once more.\nRemember, this movie was written before and\nfilmed during the September 11th air-strike-and-anthrax panic, so it's a far fetched vision of\nthe future that suddenly doesn't seem very far\nfetched after all.\nSo it's a damn good movie, but why? Well\nthere really is something for everyone here,\nwhich may actually not be so much of a good\nthing - but more on that later. The striking visuals of a deserted country are spectacular, easily besting those of close siblings (such as the\nOmega Man). Shot mostly at dawn whilst\nteams of pretty young ladies held the morning\ncommuters back, the camera work is deft and\nthe angles superbly considered to leave the\nviewer with no doubt that Jim is alone in the\nworld. The director separates the poetic peacefulness from the gut-wrenching horror with\nsped-up camera work and vicious scene\nchanges - which I think is a great touch, but is\nthe first of many reasons why it may offend diehard fans of particular genres. Musically, John\nMurphy has expertly arranged a series of ethereal pieces that further immerse the viewer into\nthe loneliness of the world - but again fans of\nBoyle's previous work, heavy on pop-culture\nand each bearing a highly distinguished sound-track, may be a touch distraught to find a eerie\nseries of more classical pieces. Maybe I'm too\ncynical about the British public, I don't know.\nGarland and Boyle have created a truly great\nBritish horror movie. They have succeeded in\nblending an unknown cast with a fantastic\nscreenplay to create a wholly new horror concept - essentially zombies that can run, climb,\njump... The Infected are a brand new breed\nfolks. 28 Days Later... is both beautiful and terrifying in equal measure. If art-house types can\nbear the violence then they'll love it. If horror-freaks can stand the lyricism and pacing of the\nfilm, then they will love it. I'm neither so I was\nan easy convert. I guess it helps that they\nfilmed in London and not, say, Milton Keynes\nbut even so. It's as good as Donnie Darko,\nwhich is clearly (to my twisted mind at least)\nthe best movie of the year so far. I promise I 'll\ntry not to say this too much more, but you have\nto see this movie.\nGet a big bag of popcorn and watch Donnie\nand 28 Days back to back, then write and tell\nus how fucked up your head has suddenly\nbecome...\nSi\nJim decides to take the tube\nfilm.felix@ic.ac.uk The student newspaper of Imperial College\n\n"
