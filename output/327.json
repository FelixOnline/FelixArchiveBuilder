An important question is raised\nhere for, as we are entering\nthis enormous campaign for\ngrant increases, should letters and articles attacking\ncleaners or any other section\nof workers in the college be\npublished? In the Grants\nCampaign we are going to\nneed the support of every\ngroup of workers or professional people we can get, to\nensure the defeat and removal from office of this gov-ern ment. When you go in for\na battle, for that is what the\nGrants Campaign is, one does\nnot want to alienate one's friends and support one's enemies. The whole of society is being polarised; today\nyou must either be on one\nside or the other. On the\nside of students, hospital\nworkers, pensioners and civil\nservants fighting to stop living standards being cut\u2014or\non the side of big business,\nproperty speculators and the\nTories, fighting to maintain\ntheir rate of profit.\nA successful Grants Campaign must be seen as a part\nof the entire class struggle.\nPlans must be made and forces mobilised to demonstrate\nthat we are not prepared to\nlie down and be trampled\nover: we must fight back.\n\"Felix\" should be part of\nthis fight for it is a student\nnewspaper. It should be a paper that discusses all the\nissues involved in the defence of students' rights \u2014\nnot one that sets out to be\nnon-partisan.\nYours, etc.,\nPETE GILLETT.\n(Note\u2014this letter has\nbeen adapted slightly to ensure grammatical correctness\nand continuity).\nEditor's Note: It would\nbe sheer hypocrisy to suppress free speech in a student\nnewspaper, which is exactly\nwhat Mr. Gillett is suggest-ing! Felix will continue to\nattempt to show all sides of\nthe argument wherever pos-sib le. More UGMs\nComrade Editor,\nI am continually shocked,\nsurprised, disappointed and\nbored to tears by reading\nsuch inchoate bourgeois political sub-thinking as portrayed in the letter from\nCharles Ftussden.\nThe habit of rambling on\nabout democracy in student\naffairs is repugnant to all\nmembers of the Union with\na trace of dialectics in their\nsouls.\nAs I understand the s ys tem, in order to ensure that\nunion meetings are represent-at ive, a random numeral,\nchosen between the greatest\nand least number of students\nlikely to attend a Union\nmeeting, is called a quorum\nand shouted out at inopportune moments by Bill (I hate\nmyself for doing this, but\n. , ..) Gerrard.\nI find it very difficult to\nbelieve that we really need\nless than one Union meeting\nevery week\u2014be they general\nor Extraordinary general\u2014to\ndecide on the best tactics\nin the continual struggle\nagainst Capitalism, but fortunately one section of the\nrevolutionary vanguard of the\nstudent proletariat (i.e., the\nExec.) is not afraid of ignoring the irrelevant whining s of the average \"moderate\"\napolitical twits and take\nvotes on contentious motions in order to defeat Tory\nattacks.\nIn closing there is one\nquestion about democracy\nto which I would be grateful\nfor an answer from Mr.\nRussden: Why should anyone\nwho isn'ta political activist\nbe allowed a vote at Union\nmeetings?\nYours fraternally,\nALASDHAIR ULYANOV\n(No relation).\nLeft-wing\nthinking\nSir,\nAt last the final solution\nhas been found!\nIt is well-known that there\ncurrently exists a global glut\nof unemployed graduates;\nthe taxpayer must pay these\npeople not only whilst they\nstudy, but also when they\nfind their expensive education unwanted. The result is\na total waste of both public\nmoney and these young\npeople's time.\nNow if the state were to\nstop giving grants to students\naltogether, fewer would\nattend universities, of course.\nThus, the surplus-graduate\nproblem would be solved\nmost neatly, as would the\nstudent-nuisance problem,\nsince most would be too busy\nearning and studying to play\nat revolution. Most important of all, more than \u00a3f00 million of public money\nwould be saved each year,\nand could be used for such\nworthy causes as the abolition of super tax and death\nduties.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. PELLY-FRY.\nVolunteers!\nSir,\nThe Wandsworth Housing\nAid Centre is a voluntary\norganisation which provides\nhousing aid and advice to\nfamilies and single people.\nIt is run by a committee of\nmembers and is staffed during the day by one (soon to\nbe two) full-time paid Coordinator. We receive most\nof our financial support from\nShelter and our services are\nfree.\nThe main work of the\nvolunteer members is to give\npreliminary interviews to\npeople who make appointments by 'phoning or calling\nin during the day. The interviews take place between\n7.00 and 9.00 Monday to\nFriday. We also have a meeting once a month. We\ndesperately need more mem-ber/interviewers who can\nspare about two evenings\nper month. No-one is expected to interview alone until\nthey have sat in with an\nexperienced interviewer for\na while. Once the interviewer\nhas taken all the details and\ngiven any advice he can, the\ncase is taken up by the full-time Coordinator.\nI should be very grateful\nif you could mention our\nneed for more volunteers in\nyour newspaper so that any\nof your students (or staff)\nwho live in the Wandsworth\narea and who are interested\nwill get in touch with us. The\npeople to get in touch with\nfor more information, date of\nnext meeting, etc. are\u2014Dave\nFerris (Coordinator) Wandsworth Housing Aid Centre\ndaytime only 870 2679\nJackie Edwards evenings\nand weekends 223 2016\nAnn Fowler, Tricia Ross\nevenings and weekends\n870 3259\nThank you.\nYours sincerely,\nJENNIFER BEARDWOOD.\nCase\nHistory\nSir,\nAs you have asked for\nletters concerning the grants\ncampaign, I thought I would\nwrite and tell you what my\nparticular story is, with regards to grants.\n1. Early in 72, I applied as\nnormal for an LEA grant, and\nwas awarded \u00a3360 pa for 3\nyears, \u00a3120 pa being deducted because of parental\nincome.\n2. At Christmas, I got\nmarried to a girl who had a4 months old baby. She did\nnot have a job then, arT d does\nnot have one now.\n3. Twice, on 'phoning my\nLEA, I was told that my grant\ncould not be changed for the\nwhole of the 3 years, e it Tier by virtue of my married\nstatus or because of the dependent child.\n4. We moved into a basement flat in Hammersmith,\nand are paying \u00a35 plus per\nweek rent, where my wife\ndoes domestic cleaning for\nthe landlady.\n5. My situation can now\nbe summarised. For an income of \u00a3360 a year, or \u00a312\na week during term time,\nwith nothing during vacation,\nI have to support myself, my\nwife, my child including all\nfood, clothing, travel expenses and books.\nIf Mr. Norman St. John\nStevas can think of how we\nare to live, I hope he will\nplease tell me.\nBILL WOOD, EEI.\n(Thank you Felix).\nAsms\nSir,\nA token stoppage by some\nhundreds of members of the\nImperial College Branch of\nASTMS took place last 'Tues-day afternoon. There is a Branch Meeting this Tuesday, February 6th, and it is\nlikely that the same event\nwill occur. Thereafter it is\nlikely to become more serious and I have no doubt that\nwe will come to the President\nof IC Union to invoke the\nagreement made between\nthe College based Unions\n(including I.C. Union) during\nthe presidency of John McCullough.\nThe situation is complex,\nbut simply it is as fo lows. In 1969 ASTMS was challenged to co-operate on an\nequal basis with the governmental Manpower Service\nUnit and the Universities to\nprovide the correct salaries\nand correct grading s for\nUniversity Technical Staff.\nThis challenge we accepted\nand have been heavily involved in detailed and constructive work. As time has\nprogressed national and local\nagreements have evolved to\nwhich ASTMS and the Universities have put their sig-natures, binding in honour\nonly. Elsewhere up and down\nthe country the administration of Universities have\nbroken such agreements\nmade. It now appears to be\nthe turn of Imperial College\nadministration.\nHaving demolished every\nsingle argument that the College administration have\nbrought forward, we find that\nthe College is breaking two\nagreements because it is\ntheir decision to do so.\nThere are other matters\nthat also concern us. A group of dedicated and provocative non-trade unionists,\nwho demand as a right every\nconcession that their trade\nunion colleagues win from\nthe College locally and from\nthe Universities nationally,\nhave been given the most\nfavoured treatment. This, including a special meeting\nwith the Rector. It may not\nbe widely known but it is\nCollege policy to deny the\nASTMS any representational\nrights as a body on any College Committee except one.\nWE sit on that one because\nwe threatened many years\nago some drastic action. It\nmay not also be widely\nknown that the present Rector has ruled that he will not\nsee representatives of\nASTMS and IC Union jointly\non any matter.\nWith the conscious\nbreaking of agreements by\nthe College and in this kind\nof atmosphere, who can\nblame our members for demonstrating their disgust.\nYours sincerely,\nH. FAIRBROTHER,\nSecretary.\nThank you,\nSon/a/ Sir,\nI refer to the letter from\nSonia Hochfelder in last\nweek's \"Felix\". Rather an\ninteresting point of view is\nput forward as regards the\nexploitation of the students\nby the bourgeoisie. This\nclass is responsible for calculating the future increased\nvalue of us students as a result of our education. Does\nSonia realise that by her letter she might have provoked\nsome bourgeoisie exploiter\nsomewhere to thinking that\nperhaps pure research in\nscience is rather un profit able?\nJust think of all those\nintellectuals, who do little\nteaching, turning out very\nlittle profit for the bourgeoisie \u2014 and being well\npaid for it. What does she\nfeel like to be a potential\ndestroyer of one of the sections of our life untainted by\nthe profit motive?\nI feel the bourgeoisie\nshould be very grateful to\nSonia for pointing out such\nan efficient system for making the most from education.\nOne wonders why they do\nnot take immediate action.\nYours sincerely,\nCHRIS STEVENS.\nBoring\nSir,\nA glance at a substantial\npart of your Letters Page last\nweek prompted me to ask\nthe following question.\nIf I were to translate a few pages from a particularly boring book, such as the\nPatagonian edition of \"Mein\nKampf\", and sandwich the\nresulting tract between the\nword \"Sir\" and my sign a ture, would you print it (with\nperhaps a neat heading such\nas \"Fascist Contraceptions\")?\nYours quizzically,\nADOLF VON WEASELGROPE,\nPresident, C.8 G.Y. N.S.S. S. Responsibility\nSir,\nThe responsible Union.\nOne year a levy on Hall\nfees for a new Hall of Residence was decided upon. The\nfollowing year there was an\nattempt to cancel it.\nOne week there was a decision to get students as a body of Union members to\nwrite letters to the UnderSecretary of State at the\nDES. The following week this\nwas cancelled.\nThe responsible union. '\nYes, I know, it isn't necessarily \"the Union Exec\"\nwhich does this. It is a number of those people who try\nto guide Union policy with\ntheir shortsighted, narrow\nand sometimes ignorant mo-t ions, resolutions and de-m and s. People who want to be\ntaken seriously should behave in a serious fashion.\nYours faithfully,\nDORI SCHMETTERLING.\nTIME FOR ACTION!\nAt long last after 3 UG Ms the Union is now going\nto DO something about getting higher grants in stead of simply making demands with nothing to back\nthem up.\nThe demonstration next Wednesday to the DES and\nthe refectory boycotts to be launched bring us right\ninto the thick of the fight for higher grants. With42 colleges on rent-strike and many more running refectory boycotts with the excellent demonstration of 500\nstudents from Thames Polytechnic to the DES last\nWednesday and that of 1,000 in Southampton the\nprevious week, there is every sign that this grants campaign is going to be the biggest success students have\never had.\nOUR CASE The justice of the claim is beyond doubt. Not only\nhas our standard of living been slashed, not only is\nthere gross discrimination against married women and\nstudents in the FE colleges, but in fact the last rise\nin 1971 was a CON. Our parents are paying most of\nit in increased contributions \u2014 many of them either\ncannot or will not pay them.\nBut reason has no effect on this Government. It\nhas taken over a year to agree to meet NUS to discuss\nthe claim. Any trade union faced with a similar response would have been out on strike months ago.\nUnfortunately students cannot have the same effect\nby striking but we must use what power we have \u2014\nthe economic power of rent strikes and refectory boycotts against the colleges and the disruptive power of\ndemonstrations, lecture boycotts (and of course re fec. boycotts as well).\nSo far the militancy of the nation-wide campaign\nhas won us two things:\u2014 firstly the DES has finally\nagreed to meet NUS on 27th Feb., secondly a number\nof vice-chancellors have made public statements supporting us.\nREFECTORY BOYCOTTS The U GM voted for this tactic by a vote of the order\nof 3 to 1 rejecting the threats made by Victor J. Mooney in last week's Felix. We must totally oppose\nany suggestion of closing the Union lower refectory\nnext year. It is becoming increasingly viable. If the\nbar in the Union Lower lounge had been opened at the\nbeginning of term as it should have been the Union ref. might well have been breaking even due to the\nincreased custom attracted.\nAs for Mooney's suggestion that the refectory staff\nwill take the boycotts as a personal insult, the boycott\nis aimed at getting higher grants and the staff will\nsurely realise this \u2014 unless, of course, someone is\nstirring up trouble to set the students and workers\nagainst each other. The Union is pledged to fight against any threat to jobs and we must take this pledge\nvery seriously indeed. We can use our representation\non the Refectories Committee to fight redundancies but\nin the last analysis its up to the union as a whole to\ntake action alongside the trade unions in College if\nthis threat is made.\nWEDNESDAY'S DEMO This must be seen as a part of the build up to the\nbig demo on Feb. 21st covering all colleges and universities in the S.E. of England. By marching to the\nDES we can firstly put some more pressure on the\nGovernment, secondly get press coverage and thirdly\ninvolve hundreds of union members in the campaign.\nAfter the demo we won't just crawl back and lie down\nagain. We have to keep up the activity, building up\nto an even bigger turn-out on February 21st. HORROR STORIES! The national (and local) press like the personal\ntouch. So if we want publicity on grants we read: \" J. Bloggs of IC is living on chips because his parents can't( or won't) give him the \u00a3150 parental contribution he\nis due.\"\nAnyone with grant difficulties out of the ordinary\nshould come into the union office and give the details to the President who will use the case history to\nget the sort of favourable press coverage we need.\nJOHN LANE ISRAEL mBe there for the25 th Anniversary\ncelebrations\nISftflHS ?Mh ANNIVERSARY\nTOURS TRAVEL TICKETS KIBBUTZ Complete programme of ISTC flights, trains, ships from\nHOSTS STUDENT TRAVEL SERVICE LTD.\n161 GREAT PORTLAND ST, W1N 6 NN Telephone 01-580 7733\n\n"

(More than just a lecture, quite an experience in fact!).\nToday he'll be grilling \u2014 and inviting you to grill \u2014 a leading\nbuilding society manager. If you think you're ever likely to buy a house, you owe it to yourself to drop everything and go to the\nlecture. See you there!\nThis week FELIX FINANCIALLY is\ngoing to lower its sights just a little.\nWhen the idea of a financial page\nwas first conceived, our intention was\nto cover the whole spectrum of\nmoney problems and particularly to\ntry to clarify some of the more obscure points we are all likely to run up\nagainst when we set out into the wide\nworld beyond the comforting walls of\nImperial College.\nWe've talked about such things as\nis ur ance policies, home loans, house\nprices and other related problems that\nwe are bound to face in the future.\nAnd, thanks to our financial adviser\nDEREK E. CUMMINGS, we think we\nhave covered the field in a more than\nusually refreshing and interesting\nway.\nIn this issue, however, we felt we\nought to get down to the ground floor\nand have a look at where most of our\nmoney comes from. So we're going to\ntalk about banks and bank managers.\nIt happens that they are the subjects about which DEREK E.CU MMINGS will be speaking when he delivers the third of his General Studies\nlectures on February 13.\nThis lecture will be of interest to\nanyone who has ever crossed swords\nwith a bank manager (and I imagine\nmost of us could show a few scars\nfrom that particular battle) since Cummings' guest that day will be the manager of a bank less than a mile away\nfrom I.C. His name is Roger Roseboom. We\nthink he's a bank manager with ad if ference: a man who has the almost\nrevolutionary view that banks \u2014 or\nrather his bank \u2014 should be in the\nbusiness of helping people rather than\njust counting their money or writing\nsmoothly insulting notes when they're\na pound overdrawn.\nHe's coming along to answer your\nquestions about banks and their managers \u2014 how they work, how they\nthink, their attitudes towards students and so on.\nHe'll lend an ear next Tuesday and\n\u2014 who knows? \u2014 he might even\nlend you some money one day. But\nhe's a shrewd cookie and he'll be\nlooking for some penetrating ques-t ions. But before we put him in the hot\nseat, we asked our man' to give us his\nideas on what banks and bank managers ought to be about.\nThere's no question about it, banking is a lovely business. It makes\nmoney on all sides. On the one hand\nthey take your money and keep it for\nyou \u2014 and then invest it to make a little profit for themselves. On the\nother hand, they lend you money \u2014\nand charge you interest on the loan.\nIt's marvellous. They can't lose.\nOK, that's a very simplistic view of\na complicated organism. But very\noften the simple approach reveals the\nfact of a matter. And it is true. Banks\ndo make money out of money, whether guarding it or lending it.\nBut, pursuing the simple approach\nmakes it obvious that banks wouldn't even be in business if it were not for\ntheir customers. Customers are not\njust important to them, they're absolutely essential.\nSo all of you with bank accounts\nought to think about that, for a start.\nLike Kitchener's army, your bank\nneeds you. For that reason, the banks spend\nmillions on trying to attract custom-ers. Leaflets, handouts, posters,\npamphlets, display advertisements\nand television are all weapons they\nuse to try to get you to put your\nmoney where their mouth is.\nMy own favourite approach is in\nthe commercial showing the happy\nhome with the bank manager in the\nbroom cupboard \u2014 if only because I know one or two bank managers I'd love to lock in a cupboard and then\nlose the key! But aside from that, this\nad points up a basic truth about the\nbanking business, namely, that your\nfortune can depend on your bank\nmanager as an individual. And this is a serious point. Unless\nyou have a lot of money, there are\nbound to be occasions when the bank\ncan help you out of a fix. That's when you have to walk into the bank and face the manager. Providing your needs are not outrageous, it's odds\non that he could help you, since bank\nmanagers have a large degree of\nautonomy and can lend fairly substantial amounts of money without reference to anyone else.\nBut will he help you?\nIt depends on the man and on you. After all, you chose him, didn't you?\nWhen you opened your first bank\naccount, you could have gone to any\nbank in the land.\nIf your man turns you down on\nwhat you feel is a reasonable request,\nthen there's only one conclusion. You've chosen the wrong bank man-ager.\nThe answer to that is to shop\naround. Go to a bank and have a chat\nwi th the manager before you open an\naccount. Talk to him, tell him your\nsituation and what sort of services\nyou expect from the bank. Ask him questions, pose a problem or two. You' ll soon find out whether he's your\nsort of blok e. If he isn't \u2014 leave. Remember that, in your search, you\nhave one factor working for you. In\na highly competitive situation, where\nall banks are going out of their way to\nattract custom, they have been forced\nto change their traditional outlook.\nThese days, they have to make themselves more attractive to the public.\nThey have to be prepared to lend\nmoney on much less secure grounds\nthan they previously demanded. And\nthe decisions on questions like that\nrest firmly with the man in the back\nroom\u2014the manager.\nThey have the powers. The trouble\nis that so many of them cannot be\nbothered to use them, to take the\nrisks, to back their judgment. Luckily,\na lot of those gents in striped pants\nand black coats are being pensioned\noff and replaced by younger men with\na younger outlook.\nWhich type you choose is entirely\nyour concern. It's as simple as that.\nAnd it's not only a question of being able to borrow a few quid, is it?\nAn intelligent and aware bank manager will be a man with whom you\ncan confidently discuss the whole\nrange of money matters.\nBanks have learned some painful\nlessons in the past few years. They've\nseen a lot of their business siphoned\noff by such institutions as merchant\nbanks and the finance houses. They\ngot into the business which the banks\nought to have mono polis ed. In fact,\nthe banks allowed it to go by default,\nsimply because they weren't prepared\nto take the risks.\nBut these days, they're right back\ninto it. So why sign a hire purchase\nagreement at an inflated rate of real\ninterest when you might be able to do\nit more cheaply with a bank loan?\nAfter all, a bank is just another\nshop \u2014 except that it sells cash. Why on earth shouldn't you, the customer,\nfeel entitled to use it on those terms?\n// you don't do that, the reason\nprobably is that your bank manager\ndoesn't encourage you to do so.\nIf you're in that situation, leave\nhim to go on sending out his little\noverdraft notes and go and find a manager who knows what modern\nbanking is all about.\nLook at it this way. If you went to\na doctor with a broken armand he\nprescribed aspirin, you' d soon find\nanother doG tor, wouldn't you?\nAs with medicine, so with finance.\nAll the facilities you are likely to need\nare there \u2014 somewhere. You have to\nfind them. Or rather, find the man who is prepared to make them available to you. , .\nAnd that means going shopping \u2014\nfor a bank manager.\nJust out of interest, FELIX\nFINANCIALLY took DEREK E. CUMMINGS at his word. We\nwent to talk to a bank manager\n\u2014Roger Roseboom himself.\nThese are some of the things he\nsaid:\n\"As I see it, banks have a duty to offer a real service to\ntheir customers, whether they be\nstudents, property developers or\nold age pensioners. And by service I mean more than just taking their money and making\nthem wait in line to cash a cheque. Service means listening\nto and trying to understand their\nproblems and then, if it is in any\nway possible, helping them to\nsolve them. That, I think, is a bank manager's prime responsibility to his customer.\n\"Now students. You ask what\nmy bank can offer a student that\nanother bank cannot. And the\nanswer is very little. Any bank\ncan offer the same facilities.\nWhether they are used depends\non the manager.\n\"What I offer any student is\nan intelligent dialogue and a willingness to help them in the\nbest way I can. We want student accounts\u2014every bank does.\nWe realise that today's student\nis tomorrow's man of property.\nIf any student from Imperial College came to me and made it\nclear he had worked hard to get\nthere, was working hard to get\nhis degree and was going to\nmake the grade when he left\ncollege, I'd jump at the chance\nto get his account in my bank.\nI'd give him a cheque book and\na cheque card to back it with.\nI'd handle his account without\ncharges\u2014although I would have\nto charge interest on any sum\noverdrawn, naturally. And when\nsummer term came and times\nwere hard, I'd be prepared to\nlisten if he wanted something to\ntide him over. I'd make it quite\nclear that I wouldn't expect him\nto go and blue the money on a new tape recorder, but if he was\nsensible and impressed me when\ntalking across my desk, I'd very\nlikely be able to help. I already\nhave a number of student\naccounts, and I think I 've been\nfair with them all.\n\"It's my job to listen to problems and to try to unravel them.\nAfter all, a talk with your bank\nmanager ought not to be like\nan audience with the Pope. I like to see my customers. I make my judgements on them\nthrough meeting them face to\nface and I 'll back my judgment\nevery time.\n\"That's what a bank mana-ger's job is all about\".\n\n"

    "content": "Page 6 FELIX February 6th,1973 THE ENVIRONMENTAL\nCRISIS\n-What it's all really about\np rest nts When you leave I.C. what are you expecting to do?\n\u2014get a good job with an expanding, science-based industry, marry, settle down and raise a family in conditions of material comfort \u2014 central heating, car,\nrefrigerator, colour television, hi-fi, etc. \u2014 and then\nwhen you are sixty, or maybe less, retire and live out\nyour last years in a leisurely and contented manner?\nFrankly, you have not got a hope in hell of succeeding.\nToday we live in an era of unprecedented material\naffluence; but it cannot last much more than another\ntwenty years or so in its present form. Why is this? It is\nsimply because there will not be available sufficient\nmaterial resources to make\nthis possible. The shortage\nwill partly arise because\nof the growing difficulty\nof meeting the exponentially - increasing requirements of the developed\nworld out of a finite\nreserve. It will be ex acer bated, however, by the\nperfectly legitimate and\nnecessary increase in the\nuse of raw materials by\nthe developing countries.\nThus the demand will not\nonly increase exponentially at the rate of ' x'% say, but the magnitude of\n'x' is also liable to in-crease.\nThe situation is made\neven more serious by the\nfact that, not only do\nenough resources have to\nbe found to produce the\ngoods we require, but we\nmust also find additional\nresources to enable us to\ncontrol the pollution we\nthereby generate. Pollution of the environment is\nsomething which, not sur-pri singly, we want to eliminate; but its prevention is\nsomething which, in conventional economic terms,\nwe shall be increasingly\nunable to afford. We allow\nit to occur at our peril, for\nonce sufficient quantities\nof pollutants are released\nto upset the basic processes of the biosphere, there\nis really no knowing what\nthe effects will be on the\nvarious forms of life on\nthe planet, including ourselves and the plants and\nanimals on which we rely\nfor our food. Indeed it\nappears from recent re-search1 that some of the\nmost fundamental bio-sph eric processes are only\njust being discovered, let\nalone understood in sufficient depth to enable us to\npredict how easily they\nmay be disturbed, or what\nthe resulting effects will\nbe!\nThus the environmental\ncrisis is not merely a collection of localised, unrelated problems such as\npollution, noise, shrinking\ncountryside, etc., which it\nis just convenient to lump\ntogether under one head-ing. It is much more fundamental than this, and is\nbasically concerned with\nthe material constraints\nplaced by nature upon\nmankind's efforts to progress towards a more ideal\nworld. This is in sharp\ncontrast to conventional\npolitical ideologies which\nare mostly concerned with\nthe human constraints.\nThings have come to a head because industrial\ncivilisation has for too long\nallowed itself to accept in\na relatively uncritical man-ner, as a measure of what\nis good, the rate of increase of material wealth.\nThis has been a workable\nstandard until now because\nour demands upon the\nearth's resources have been\neasily satisfiable. Such a situation cannot, by definition, continue for ever\nand we are now in the uncomfortable position of\nseeing that, having due regard to the political realities of the world today, a major disruption of the\ngrowth process is going to\noccur well within the lifetime of present-day stud-ents.\nNeedless to say, such a perturbation will have\ncolossal economic and\npolitical repercussions. 1\nmay have given the impression earlier that the\n'environmental thesis' can\nbe regarded as an alternative to conventional political ideologies; if so I apologise. For any political theory to be complete\nit must obviously have due\nregard to both the physical\nand human realities of the\ncurrent world situation.\nWhat, therefore, does the\nenvironmental argument\nimply in terms of the conventional left-right political\ndebate?\nFirst let us deal on a global scale. If one asks\nthe average intelligent person in this country how\nthey can justify living in\nconditions of material\naffluence whilst the majority of the world's population lives in relative\npoverty, they will probably say something to the\neffect that, life being what\nit is, civilisation develops\nin some areas faster than\nin others and that we\nneed n't really worry about\nbeing so rich since the\npoorer countries will in time develop and catch us\nup. One of the most important political effects of\nthe environmental argument is that it exposes this\nidea for the absolute nonsense that it is. The poorer\ncountries of the world have\nno hope of all simultaneously enjoying the present\nEuropean-type standard of\nliving since there are not\nnearly sufficient resources\nto enable them to do this.\nOf course we must not\nmake the mistake of\nassuming that all the\npeoples of the world will\nnecessarily want to develop in the same industrial manner as today's 'developed' countries have.\nHowever, it is apparent\nthat very many countries\nare intent on doing just\nthis, and that they are\nbeing greatly encouraged\nin their efforts by the developed world. Furthermore it would be cruelly\nunrealistic to deny that the\ndeveloping countries will\nhave to greatly increase\ntheir use of resources\nsimply in order to bring\ntheir material standard of\nliving up to a minimum\nacceptable level.\nAs far as politics within\nthe developed world is con-cern ed, the environmental\nargument totally transcends the conventional\nleft-right dichotomy. It has\nbeen suggested, rather irresponsibly 1 think, that\nthe environmental crisis\nhas been caused solely by\ncapitalism and that all we\nhave to do is to change to\na socialist system and the\nproblem will automatically\ndisappear. This is not true\nsince the problem can only\nbe solved by abandoning\nthe ideal of non-stop economic growth in material\nterms, and not merely by\nchanging the way in which\nthe fruits of our labours\nare distributed. This of\ncourse does not mean that\nthe left-right argument is\nnow irrelevant or unnecessary. It will naturally remain arguable as to what\nis the most favourable\npolitical system under\nwhich to come to terms\nwith the present crisis.\n1 have not covered here\nevery aspect of the problem by any means and I hope to discuss some other\nissues, particularly that of\npopulation growth, in a further article.\nMIKE ROBSON( Chem. P. G.)I.C. Eco-Action.\n' J.E. Love lock et al., Nature1973,241,194 and refs. there in. My last '\"Broadsheet-in-Felix\" article stimulated a response I did not anticipate and which J had intended\nto ignore on two grounds. Firstly, I do not like to, or\nwish to, indulge in pointless derogatory and back-biting\nremarks about anyone but prefer to present my point\nof view and facts in a relatively straightforward manner\nwithout attacking any particular individual. My last\narticle was not aimed at anyone specifically and if\npeople felt\" certain facts had been omitted they could\nhave merely said what these were (any other remarks\nwould surely be irrelevant to the point of the article).\nSecondly, I refuse to get involved in a childish \"slang-ing-match\" that would only serve to waste Felix space\nand bore the rest of its readers. I shall therefore merely\nanswer the points raised in the guild sheet article and\ncurious letter that appeared last week, without being\ntoo nasty, and hope the matter Will subsequently be\ndropped (with the exception of new developments of\ncourse).\nThe letter by Mr. van Weaselgrope is hardly worth\ncommenting on, not only because of its obvious lack of\nseriousness, but because the writer has not the courage\nof his convictions and is too cowardly to put his own\nname to his literary excreta, but prefers to sling his\nmud and hide behind some pseudonym. I shall remark\nhowever that the \"revenge squad\" that took the records,\nfiles, etc., had not indulged in a mascot ry raid before\nand merely desired to annoy those concerned by removing these articles which were promptly returned\nwithin half an hour with apologies. Any damage incurred in a raid was of course accidental (not deliberate\nas was claimed) and I notice when guilds retrieved the\nshields they were not reluctant to leave the R.C.S. office\nin a mess by knocking things over and pinching copies\nof the latest Broadsheet (which they would have received\nanyway, even though they have difficulty finding someone in guilds who can read).\nThis brings me onto the guild sheet article, I'm glad\nto see Broadsheet is no longer the only C.C. V. publication to respond to the Felix editor's request for regular\nopinion articles and hope that in future guild sheet will\nhave something to say that is worth reading (unlike the\nmonotonous format and low standard of guild sheet itself). I was a little puzzled at the fact that the editor\ndid not write the article (although judging by what I 've\nseen of guild sheet I doubt that it has one) and instead\nthis was done by a gentleman who apparently dates\nbearded young ladies (I draw this conclusion from the\nfact that he was uncertain of my sex at the start of the\narticle but managed to guess right by the end\u2014well\ndone, sir!). I also wondered why this article was on the\nsports page, considering the unnecessarily nasty comments it contained, its hardly cricket, is it chaps? Perhaps they are trying to initiate a new sport\u2014Ron bash-ing! Well, Mr. Hanson should \"get his facts right\", had\nnot the guilds tw at s in their office attempted to throw\none of our valiant lads over the balcony to the ground\nsome ten feet below then perhaps their cheap ashtray\nwould not have got broken in the scuffle. Admittedly,\nsome letters for the guilds float got broken, but Mr. Hanson has exaggerated the actual number from four\nto his \"breaking half the letters\".\nI forgot to mention that the R.C.S. sign WAS seen\nby our lads in the infamous glass cabinet but no attempt\nto retrieve it was made since the cabinet was locked.\nPerhaps I should add that the shields are still in our\npossession as is Mr. Newman's( guilds president) hat\nfollowing the Morphy Day antics and that mysterious\nV.C. anchor (beautifully painted in the R.C.S. colours)\nwas wheeled into the R. C.S.U. G.M. last Tuesday.\nThe general feeling of those associated with Broadsheet is that mascot ry is to be encouraged as long as it\nis done by \"sleigh t of hand\" and does not degenerate\ninto open warfare, which was regrettably becoming the\ncase at the end of last term. 1 therefore hope that any\ndevelopments this term are of a more sedate and sophisticated manner.\nRON APPLEBY( Broadsheet Editor).\nFeelsick No. 327, Tuesday February Sicks 1973 were Edited\nby Oliver Dowson F. with implicated, as well, Ron Apple bee,\nMartin Black, Alasdhair Campbell (Vomitoria L.T.D.), Derek\nCummings, Arbro Schasm, David Hobman, Graham King, John\nLane, Gordon Reece, Pdavid Rose, Michael SMverleaf, John Stares\nand Steven Swailes.

Organised by rank and file\naction committee, many\nwere angry at the lack of\nleadership which NUS had given.

Many of them\nbeing on discretionary\nawards or getting no\ngrants at all, they were\nnot deterred.\nThere are people at IC who say the same about\nour demo tomorrow, but\nwe will not be deterred\neither. The rapid price in creases and the effects of\nthe growing trade war, the\npossible cancellation of\nConcorde and the subsequent cutback in jobs for\ntechnologists make it essential that we come out\nnow to defend our democratic rights.

The cost of \u00a31 includes the coach fare.\nA piece of classical music for introduction, as always, and then a smartly dressed Flash, led by Peter Banks, took the stage and leapt straight into a lengthened version of \" Small Beginnings\" on its completion. The stage looked a little different from usual, with three banks of lights and two enormous flags \u2014 one Stars and Stripes, and one Union Jack( nicely hung upside down) presumably to denote the fact that\nthe Beck Bogart Appice band are Anglo American. Their introduction was an announcement of each member of the band along with his nationality followed by the bashing of a rather large gong, though the number they followed it with was very average, each instrument drowning the other two. Flash and B. B.A.'ssets seemed to be directly opposed. Flash did three more long numbers,\" Black and White\" of their forthcoming\" Flash in the Can\" L.P. and\" Children of the Universe\" and\" Dreams of Heaven\" from their first L.P. which if you' ve seen once you won't forget. It\nwas banned from display in one of the countries in Central America( which one I can't remember) because the President had a heart attack when he saw it in a shop Future Shock\nAlvin Toffler\nPan 5 0 pence\nAlvin Toffler is dealing with people,\nhe is dealing with reality, he is dealing with people when they are overwhelmed by change or when they fail\nto adapt to the future.\nVery carefully this author takes\neveryday events, the products we buy\nand use, the places we travel to and how we travel, the people whom we know and the speed with which they\ndisappear and shows how all these\nthings are changing, turning into a visible torrent of change, sucking and tugging everyone of us into a future\nout of our depths. He shows how future invades us, how she rushes\ncloser to grasp us in her open arms\nand points out the importance of not\nsitting back and sucking the future\nfrom the safety of history but g rap42> window. Each of the numbers contained a solo spot for Peter Banks, proving that, as widely acclaimed, he is one of the finest guitarists in the world, stroking out chords, picking out notes and plucking out riffs\nwith great beauty, perhaps he did overdo the feedback. Unfortunately several people in the aud.en ce had neither culture nor manners, and just wouldn't keep quiet. The rest of the time they reminded me a little\nof the early Yes days, which isn't surprising, with Ray Bennett' s powerful bass and Banks' s runs( and Colin Carter even sounded like Jon Anderson on the record),s oI was quite pleased with them. B.B. A., however, tended to play shorter numbers rolled together, and produced a far fuller sound, with some gutsy guitar work by Mr. Beck, though they did perform a few slower numbers in Which he exploited the more delicate use of the guitar. Their set included a bass solo and an interesting and quite lengthy drum solo, and I was quite looking forward to Beck's solo, but this was not to be, as such, for he jus<\ncontinued, with his short bursts every now and again, though the audience didn't mind and dragged them back for an encore. G.J. K.p ling with her as real live flesh and blood \u2014 now! Future Shock is unrivalled in its\ncomprehensive study of the human\nrace, original in its approach and unique in its examples. The author\nselects these examples well and there\nare really so many good ones it's difficult to know which one to choose to\nillustrate his point, however, the following did particularly appeal. It\nappears in the chapter on 'throw-away\nsociety' along with paper wedding dresses, throw-away bottles, cans\nand paper handkerchiefs.\n\" Recently Mattel announced a new\nimproved Barbie doll. The new version has a slimmer figure, 'real'\neyelashes and a twist-and-turn waist\nthat makes her more human than ever.\nMoreover, Mattel announced that, for\nthe first time, any young lady wishing\nto purchase a new Barbie would receive a trade-in allowance for her old one\". DAVID HOB MAN Sex, dental surgery and watching\na film have one similar after-effect \u2014\nthey leave me in a vague, mindless\ndaze. \" Portnoy' s Complaint\"( Warner\nRendezvous and ABC, Fulham Road)\ncompletely drained the life out of me.\nMaybe it was because it was10.30 a.m., or because I hadn't had any\nbreakfast, or simply that it was my first trip to the cinema for at least six\nmonths: I don't know. But, devoid of\nany hope of diversion, I spent most\nof the 9 9 minutes it lasted wondering\nwhat could have driven Ernest Lehman to make the film in the first place\nand what would drive anybody to see\nit.\nI guess they're hoping it'll be the\nposters declaring that \" Portnoy' s Complaint is catching\". Of course,\nthis presupposes that you know what\nPortnoy's Complaint is, and that if\nyou don't you'll be driven by a manic\ndesire to find out. Revelations ensue.\nWell, there's this guy called Alexander Portnoy (Richard Banjamin, no\nI hadn't heard of fv m either) who s the Assistant Commissioner of Human\nOpportunity for the City of New York\n(whatever that is). And we meet h;m lying on a psychiatrist's couch, recounting the history of his complaint\nand its effects.\nHis complaint is sexual obsession,\nand Mr. Lehman gives us a thousand\nor two feet of celluloid insight into\nhis teenage years as an inveterate\nmast ur bator in his family of self-suf faring mother, constipation\u2014suffering\nfather and obesity\u2014suffering sister.\nWhat happens to him between the\nages of 16 and33 is anyone's guess,\nfor by an ever-confusing system of\nflashbacks that's where we find h'm next, picking up the Monkey, alias\nMary Jane Reed (Karen Black) on a street corner at midnight. Three\nframes later she \"fulfils his most\nexotic sex fantasies\", according to\nthe press release\u2014but they don't show you any of that. Mind you, it\nneeds little i mag'na ton to fill in the\nblanks in the rest of the film, which consists of shots of them alternately\ndriving across open country and muttering foul r.oth 'ngs whilst curled up\nin bed. To cut a long and incredibly boring\nstory short, they go on holiday in\nEurope, just about fall out, when they\npick up an Italian girl and have a three-way affair in Rome and fall out\ncompletely the next day in Athens\n(fast movers, these Yanks). He leaves\nher threatening to jump out of the\nw' n dow, flies back to NY, and finds\nhm self imagining seeing her jump\ndown at him every time he looks up\nat a building. So he whips along to\nthe head shrink er. Which is exactly\nwhe-ewe started.\nI found the film neither entertaining nor inspiring. Don't waste money\non seeing it.\nPAUL ROC H FORT "

They simulated the part well, even to the greased back hair and\nplaying the guitar while kneeling on the ground.

Every second nearer\nthat moment when you finally receive your degree brings you closer to\na lifetime of barren servility stretching away to\nthe grave, to be a cog in\nthe vast machine of production with no future,\nbut to keep grinding\naway producing surplus\nvalue for the enrichment\nof that porcine few they\ncall the bourgeoisie.\nHamstrung unions,\nsell - out leadership,\nPhase II, Phase III, in fla tion, urban pollution,\nrural desecration; how can this miserable prospect be reconcilable with\nthe giant technological\nleaps forward leading\nup to the 1 9 7 0 ' s \u2014 if\nyou think that sounds\ngrim, remember the sagacious words of the\nCareers Advisory Officer:\n\"If the graduate unemployment doesn't get\nyou, the premature redundancies will!\" Vladimir Catnip, Felix's Political correspondent, writes: The facts are plain for all to\nsee, but facts are not\nenough, we need empirical evidence with which to arma revolutionary\nparty so it can lead the\nworking class to victory.\nTherefore we call on\nevery man, woman and child to help us in the\ncompilation of a nation-wide Nauseating Moneymakers' Map, which will enable us to pinpoint\nevery capitalist in Britain\ntoday.\nWith the aid of a grant from the ACB we can equip everyone who asks with a special Felix\nKit 4 consisting of a camera with telephoto\nlens, long range conversation monitors, lapel\nmicrophones, Rolls Royce proximity meters,\ntape measure for measuring girth of suspects,\nDaily Torygraph sensors\nand the address of the\nAthenaeum.\nA trial run of the kit\nwith a random selection\nof students from Imperialist College resulted in\n5 electrocutions (2\nfatal), 1 Bentley S3 identified out of a rand om sample of minis and Fiat 5 0 0 ' s,23 irrevocably knotted tape measures and14 blue movies\nof Sonia Hochfelder.\nWe feel however, that\nwith a larger number of\nparticipants, the results\nobtained should be of\ngreater revolutionary sig-n if i can ce. The preliminary results of the trial survey\nshow that only a small\nregion of bog west of\nCater's beam on Dartmoor may be the only\narea in Britain today still\nfree from capitalism.\nBut with this special\nFELIX kit you should be\nable to start Britain on\nthe road to Socialism( no relation) and in crease your own political\nconsciousness at the\nsame time. Enough data\nshould be collected by\nthis campaign for the\nACB to correctly analyse\nthe current objective political factors in Britain\ntoday that will enable\nthem to lead the mass\naction to force the Tories\nto resign and return a Labour government\npledged to Socialist poli-cie s. Examples of Capitalist Spoor\nPhosphorous\nthe Jobrot\nand Ferocious Din\nPort eight of the serial is ation of the book by\nS.J. Swailes\nGeorge's boat floated gently on her moorings, as the three adventurers, and the proud owner stood by the water's edge staring out over the deep blue sea.\" Jolly nice,\" said Ferocious,\" but how are we supposed to get out there?\"\" Ah,\" said the smiling captain,\" I have a dinghy for just that purpose, cunningly concealed yonder.\" Ferocious followed George's pointing arm. He could see\nnothing even vaguely like a dinghy. The Jungle Controller beamed a this companion's confusion.\" Over here,\" he said, leading the party towards a huge shell like object, half buried in the s and. When they drew near they could see that it was avast clam, with\" Tender to Overdraft\" painted on the top half.\" Overdraft?\" said Ferocious incredulously.\" Yes, um,\" mumbled George,\" before coming to the jungle, I worked in a bank, and1 bought her on an Overdraft, so it seemed appropriate at the time. Actually, I call her Fanny, now.\"\" Quite understandable, dear boy,\" said Ferocious with a smile,\" but surely that mol usc is not the Tender?\" George laughed knowingly.\" No,no,\" Jie said,\" the dinghy is inside.\" Hele ant forward and banged on the huge shell.\" Push off,\" said the clam,\" this is private property.\" George sighed,\" Don't be silly, Enid,\" he said,\" it's me, George.\"\" O.K.\" said Enid,\" just checking.\" With a creaking of sinews, a crack appeared at the join in the two halves of the shell. Slowly the upper half lifted to reveal a small black rubber dinghy, and an outboard motor.\" There we are,\" said George proudly,\" that' show we get out to Fanny.\" With Ferocious' help the Jungle Controller lifted the dinghy from its hiding place, and Enid shutdown behind them.\" Cheer io George,\" she called after the adventurers, as they made their way down to these a.\" I think,\" said George,\" that we had bet-ter make two trips, considering the size of some members of the party.\"\" Sorry,\" said the Twig worm.\" No trouble,\" said George, as he pushed the little boat into the water and jumped in,\" You come with me, Phosphorous and Ferocious; I'll comeback for the Twig worm in a moment.\" Phosphorous and Ferocious clambered into the boat, and George pushed off with a paddle. As soon as he was in deepwater the Jungle Controller lowered the outboard motor and pulled the string. To his surprise it started first pull.\" Not often that happens,\" he said with a grin,\" perhaps it's a good omen.\" With the motor buzzing angrily the dinghy headed out to.wards the Fanny. Meanwhile the Twig worms at at the water's edge, in its usual heap, idly burying its huge feet in the s and, and wondering sadly where Its Twig wor mery had got to. A shout awoke the large creature from its dreaming. George had returned, and was suggesting that the Twig worm step aboard. With some stumbling and much splashing, this was achieved, and, bow practically beneath the waves, the dinghy returned to the old ketch. Again at risk to life and limb, the Twig worm was persuaded out of the dinghy and on to the scrubbed decks of George's boat.\" Right,\" said the master mariner,\" let's get some sail up, and we can be away.\" Unfortunately neither Phosphorous nor Ferocious had ever been sailing before, and the Twig worm had only been afloat on a Twig wor mery which just drifted.\" Nevermind,\" said the ever optimistic George,\" you' ll soon pick it up.\" He gave them a short lecture on the principles of sailing, with amusing anecdotes and little diagrams. They felt none the wiser.\" Nevermind,\" said George, less optimistically,\" If the worst comes to the worst, I can handle her by myself.\" It was time to make a move. Under George's instructions they managed to raise the mainsail and a jib \u2014 the latter upside down twice. George's good humour was wearing thin.\" Right\" he shouted,\" Castoff the mooring, Ferocious.\"\" Come again?\" asked the acting first mate.\" Untie the rope at the front, the one that' s fixed to the Buoy.\" said the captain through clenched dentures.\" Why didn't you say so in the first place?\" shouted back a tactless Ferocious, as he dropped the jib on the Twig worm's head.\" Sorry, wrong string,\" came the cry from up forward. George said a seaman like rude word under his breath. With much shouting of \" haul hard me handsome s!\" and\" splice the upper forego o lies\" Ferocious managed to get the jib backup and finally to cast off. The old boat swung round on to a port tack, heeled gently in the light air, and headed out to sea. George stood proud lv at the helm as his pride and joy sliced smoothly through the swell. He was joined in the cockpit by the rest of the crew. To fit them all in, the Twig worm was pushed down below, and told to make some coffee.\n\" But I don't knowhow!\" he protested.\" Twi o worms don't usually drink coffee.\"\" Alright, dear old enormous nautical person.\" said Ferocious,\" you come out here and I'll make the coffee.\" There was a moment of panic when it appeared that Ferocious and the Twig worm were going to be jammed in the companionway, but somehow it resolved itself leaving the Twig worm on the outside and Ferocious on the inside as intended. George had been studying the trim of the sails and considering the weather.\" As there isn't much wind,\" he said\" I think that we should put some more sail up.\" Phosphorous and the Twig worm looked at each other sadly.\" I'm right in the middle of making the coffee,\" came a voice from below.\" I'm afraid you' ll have to count me out. as it were.\" George raised his eyes skywards.\" Alright,\" he said\" Phosphorous and the Twig worm can do it. I want you to get the mizzen and the stay sail up.\"\" Eh?\" said Phosphorous. George did his he st to explain.\" Well we'll have ago anyway, won't we Twig?\" said Phosphorous.\" Oh, yes,\" said the Twig worm,\" we'll do our best.\" With much falling over, and pulling of ropes they managed to raise the appropriate sails, but not before the Twig worm had fallen through the fore hatch twice, and Phosphorous had shot up to the top of the mainmast with a cry of\" Haul a wav. Twig!\" Bruised, but not unduly discouraged the pair returned to the cockpit. Certainly the extra sail had made a difference: the v were bowling along now with a creaming white wake, and sufficient heel for Ferocious to drop George's coffee down the back of the chart table.\"S\" r>v ah nut that, dear old captain sir.\" he said.\" I'll prepare some more, as you might say.\" None of these disasters could detract from George's happiness. Standing, feet apart, at the tiller of his own boat, the wind in his face, the deck creaking and swaying beneath him, the heavy red canvas bulging above his head \u2014 he was contentment personified.

However, this coach was delayed\nfor forty minutes whilst all those who had brought cars\nto go in found somewhere to park them. From the\nstart trouble was evident, since the strong men of the\ncommittee, Ron Pa'mer and Mick Downs, had to persuade the driver that Harrow means Stanmore. Not to be outdone got well and truly lost in Harrow \u2014\nor was it Stanmore?\nThings then became more confused as the two\nteams had to be dropped off at two different grounds.\nWell the 3rd XI were taken to the door, but the 1st XI \u2014 even with the help of an AZ \u2014 had to climb over\na railway bridge and trundle through muddy fields\nbefore they caught sight of the mud-heap that became\nthe pitch.\nMention here should be made of John Astley who\nthought it would be better to go by scooter armed\nwith an AZ. After an even greater tour of Harrow\nthan the coach, John finally found the 3rd XI ground,\nbut then decided it was too late to try and find the\nlet XI; so he went home!\nThe match itself \u2014 shortened due to our late arrival\n\u2014 was very average. Harrow, even with an extra\nman, did not live up to expectations as members of\nthe 1st division of the Middlesex League. The first half\nended with a blank score-sheet, mainly due to the\nhome side's erratic shooting.\nThe second half had some memorable scenes: Mick Downs clearing off the goal-line with everybody else\nbeat; Mick Downs \u2014 again in defence \u2014 wildly swi p ing, but missing the ball and knob bling Tim Hansen's shins. He even swore after the match he wasn't pissed\nthe night before.\nThe final score was 1 \u2014 1 Colin Dyer scoring for IC after a fluff by the keeper. The equalise r by Harrow\nfollowed a free hit from just outside the circle.\nTeam: S. Boulton; R. Cameron, R. Palmer; B. Evans, T. Hanson, G. Popple; A. Tatchell, M. Downs,\nJ. Gahir, C. Dyer.\nRumour has it that the 2nd XI lost 3\u20140 and the 3rd XI drew 1\u20141, John Andrews being the scorer; but\nrumour of the result of last Wednesday's1st XI match\nagainst Brunei still has to seep through to darkest\nClapham. Doesn't anybody know where the Math's letter racks are?\nAfter last week's report Mick Downs demanded an\napology for his mention but I move that he should\ndrink a pint of Heineken since he arranged a Sunday\nmorning match which was called off by the opposition\n\u2014 a fact 1 did not learn until I arrived at Harlington.\nmotor sport\nReaders of other College publications will have\nnoticed that Iam once\nagain contributing to\nBROADSHEET( wot zat? \u2014 Ed).
