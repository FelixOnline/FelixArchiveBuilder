Despite the fact that no serious\nmountaineering equipment is\nnecessary, it remains an intimidating\nventure to the first-timer, and one\nthat is not to be underestimated.\nThe route to the summit is 8.7\nkilometres and a constant, reliable\nsupply of energy is the order of the\nday. Athletes may swear by jelly\nsweets, Skittles or glucose tablets for\na sugar hit. I\u2019m putting my faith in\nblueberry Cream-Os, an ersatz local\nvariant of Jammie Dodgers (although\nMalaysians may justifiably claim that\nJammie Dodgers are an ersatz local\nvariant of Cream-Os).\nFifteen of us have booked through\nthe same lodge, an eclectic bunch\nranging from a group of Filipino\nmountain climbing enthusiasts, to\nsome Kings College Medics away on\nan elective, plus a few lone wolves\nlike myself. Most of us had met for\nthe first time at dinner the previous\nnight, but a good day of climbing\nis more than enough time to forge\nfriendships.\nThe minivan enters the park, which\nis humming and swirling with tourists from all parts of the world. Some\nare here to visit the nature reserve at\nthe foot of the mountain and some\nare fellow climbers, either ready to\nembark upwards or triumphantly\nreturning from the top.\nThe van speeds on past them to the\nfirst checkpoint at the start of the\nascent, where IDs and climb permits\nare checked to prevent interlopers\nsneaking in without having paid the\nrequisite fees. This climb is a must for\nvisitors to Borneo and although it is\ncomparatively benign, the mountain\nhas proved dangerous to the lackadaisical traveller. Indeed, it is mandatory\nto apply for a licence/permit to climb,\nand to have a local guide lead the way\nto prevent these kinds of calamities\nfrom happening.\nThe first 500 metres are, somewhat\nbizarrely, downhill \u2013 as if to lull you\ninto a false sense of security. As the\ngradient changes to an upward trajec-tory, I feel a stab in my groin and remember having pulled a muscle two\ndays ago playing five-a-side football\nin the jungle. I instantly regret that\ndecision.\nA UNESCO World Heritage site\nsince 2000, the Kinabalu National\nPark has an astonishing level of\nbiodiversity for any location in the\nworld, let alone one encompassing\nan area of its size. This includes a\nscarcely believable 800 species of orchids and more species of ferns than\nthe whole of Africa, not to mention\nthe infamous Rafflesia flower, known\nfor its alluring scent of rotting flesh.\nWithin the first kilometre or so\nwe spy a few tiny pitcher plants;\nthere are larger, more magnificent\nones further up. Meanwhile, mon-keys, squirrels and birds collaborate\nunseen to serenade our advance up\nthe slope, and we are surrounded by a\nkaleidoscope of floral colour.\nAnd yet, much of this remains un-noticed. Bursts of intense, heavy rain\npunctuate the slow trudge upwards\nlike artillery fire, nearly tearing\nthrough the cheap, plastic poncho I\nam wearing. The further we go, the\nless I notice the environment; I focus\nsolely on the uneven, orange path\nahead.\nThe regular rest stops offer some\nrefuge from this tunnel vision, where\nwe watch the mountain squirrels,\nshrews and an assortment of small\nbirds playing about in the under-growth, occasionally venturing out to\nforage for crumbs dropped by some\ncareless climbers.\nOn and on we go, step by step up\nthe man-made stairs cut into the\npath. Greetings are murmured to\nthe intermittent streams of people\ndescending, their weary grins of\nsatisfaction the only thing keeping us\nfrom quitting. But into the afternoon\nthis counter-flow reduces to a trickle.\nAscending groups have dispersed\ninto individuals or duos, constantly\novertaking each other in a race that\nno one has the energy to win.\nMy injury has cut me adrift from\nmy comrades, and I\u2019m starting to feel\nevery step reverberate through my\nbody. The terrain has become more\nThe obligatory photo next to the peak sign, marking the triumphant trek\nthrough rain and sweat . Photo: Aditya Narayanan\nrugged and rocky, with coniferous\ntrees increasingly bordering the path,\nwhich seems to wind ever steeper\naround the mountain.\nThe vegetation is sparser, and\nfrequent gaps in the tree line uncover\na window looking out onto the landscape further down and a carpet of\ngreen (this is the jungle, after all).\nIt is now more than 3000 metres\nabove sea-level, parity with the cloud\nlevel. A fine mist hugs the skin and\nthe altitude faintly suffocates. I curse\nhaving over-packed for this trip; \u201cYou\nmust be a very strong guy\u201d my guide\nEddie smirks with bemusement.\nThe bright white blocks of the base\ncamp appear, thrust out of the side of\nthe mountain, and I somehow drag\nmyself to the dorm and throw myself\ninto bed. The time is now 16:30, and\nwe will make our summit attempt in\neight hours.\nWe are up by 01:50 for an early\nbreakfast. The sleep has done its job\nand I feel refreshed and full of energy.\nAt 02:45 we head off from the base\ncamp along with a hundred or more\nothers, forming a single file caravan\ndistinguishable from afar only by\nthe pinpricks of light from our head\ntorches.\nThere is one more checkpoint to\nreach by 05:00 or we will be turned\naway from the summit. Helpfully,\nthe park management committee\nhave constructed a series of wooden\nstaircases up the lower reaches of this\nstretch. Progress is slow, this time\nbecause of the sheer volume of traffic\nmoving uphill, and we can see nothing except the heels of the person in\nfront.\nA solid rock face looms out of the\nblack night; we must now use a rope\nto pull ourselves up.\nI find it surprisingly easy to haul\nmyself up the slope, a feeling shared\nby those around me, although I\nsuspect this may just be adrenaline\npushing us forward. After what feels\nlike only ten minutes, we come up\nto a small porta-cabin, and for the\nsecond time I must get out my climbing permit. Only 2 kilometres left to\nthe summit.\nThe slope is much less steep at this\npoint, and progress is smooth despite\nthe rarefied air. After a while the first\nlights of dawn appear on the horizon,\nand I quicken my pace slightly. I see\na cluster of lights circling in close\nproximity to each other like a swarm\nof fireflies; it can only be the summit.\nThe dawn seems to sense my ap-proach, for it delays, breaking just as\nmy foot reaches the uppermost ridge.\nThere are maybe 30 people along this\nnarrow strip of rock, bordered by a\nrope fence which cordons off a dizzying drop.\nThe sun\u2019s rays unfurl onto a blanket\nof white cloud. For a moment it feels\nlike an anticlimax, as if the famous\nview at sunrise will be kept. Then the\nmorning cloud clears, opening up the\njaw-dropping expanse below.\nFor a fleeting second, I know what it\nfeels like to be on top of the world.\nTo those who want to climb, Jungle\nJack\u2019s Backpackers provides the best\nrate, which is approximately MYR\n600 and includes two night\u2019s accommodation at his lodge near the park\nand all meals. Unlike other agencies/\nlodges (which are grossly overpriced\nanyway), you can book climbs at short\nnotice i.e. a few days in advance.\nA spectacular view above the clouds atop the rugged mountain that has\nnow been conquered .

I was playing a\nlot of Slenderman and Amnesia\nat the time it came out, but as I had\njust bought Machine for Pigs I couldn\u2019t\njustify to myself the cost of yet another\nhorror game. Fortunately, I recently\nfound Outlast and its expansion,\nWhistleblower, on sale and I was able to\npick them up and finally play Outlast.\nOn the surface Outlast is a pretty\nsimple game. You play as a journalist\nwho has heard of some shady goings\non at Mount Massive Asylum. Armed\nwith your trusty camera with night\nvision mode you sneak into the\nAsylum and quickly realise that it was\na really, really bad move. The main\nobjective of Outlast is to escape the\nAsylum which is hard as events make\nit so you can\u2019t go back and pushes\nyou further into the darkness. The\ngame itself, on normal difficulty. is\nnot difficult: the controls are easy;\nthe puzzles are often simple; and the\ngame seems to always push you in the\nright direction. Outlast is fun because\nit is the most terrifying game I\u2019ve ever\nplayed.\nWhen I first started I didn\u2019t know\nwhat to expect, but 20 minutes in I had\njumped out of my chair, paused the\ngame and nearly turned my computer\noff in a panic. After that I was very\nwary of every door, every turn in the\ncorridors and every button push. Even\nby being careful, being on high alert\nand expecting to jump Outlast catches\nyou out every time and creates an\natmosphere in which you are never\nsafe. You could run through the game\nnever looking back, but you can\u2019t\nhelp but walk around slowly and peep\nround corners.\nIt\u2019s this constant fear of an enemy\njumping out or the lights turning off\nand having to use the night vision on\nyour camera only to realise its run out\nof battery and you are plunged into\ndarkness anyway that makes Outlast so\nenjoyable.\nOutlast has some collectible\ndocuments as well as the insane mode\nin which dying sends you back to the\nstart to appeal to the more hardcore\ngamers. For everyone else it\u2019s a horror\nexperience that draws you in just a\nlittle bit more than it scares you away.\nIt is a great game that will keep you\nentertained for hours and I would\nrecommend it to all horror fans.\nsomedouchebagwhowillruinthegame\nforyoubytrolling,justnotcaring,or\nbeinganasshole.Infact,foragood\ngamingexperienceyouaredependent\nonotherpeople,whichshouldnotbe\ntheaimofagame.Singleplayergames\ncanonlyentertainyouwiththecontent\nthattheyaremadewith,socreators\nhavetotrythatbitmuchharderto\nmakecreativestories,interesting\ncharactersandagenerallyfungame.\nMysecondbigproblemwithMMOs\nisyourinabilitytoinherentlychange\nanything.Everythinginthegame\ninitsaccompanyingworldthatyou\nexperience,everythingthatyouchange\nhasbeenexperiencedandchangedby\nsomebodyelsebeforeyou.Yousaved\nthewold?Wow,nobodyhasdone\nthatinthatworldaswell?Infactthey\nprobablydiditexactlythesamewayas\nwell.Atleastinsingleplayergamesyou\nhaveyourownlittlestory,youcandoit\nyourownwayandcreateyourownlittle\nworld.\nBasicallywhatIamtryingtosayin\naroundaboutway,isthatpeopleseem\ntobelievethatonlinegamingisallthat\nthereis.Theemergenceofpurelyonline\ngameslikeDota 2andLeague of Legends,\nseemtosuggestthatjustbeingableto\nsitdownonyourownandplaythrough\nastorywithoutsomeoneyellinghow\ntheywillbangyourmomissomehow\nnotfun.\nNow,Iamofftoturnoffmyinternet\nandhaveadatewithoneofmygames.\nJustme,myselfandthegame.\nOh, hey there...ahmm....selfie?

And yet here we are, Monday\nmorning (potentially wet, although\nI hope the weather stays dry for\ntomorrow, I hate delivering papers\nin the rain), with a new Felix around\ncampus. What gives?\nThis is actually the first issue of\nFelix to have been borne from our\ncompletely new office. Nestled away\nat the back of the West Basement,\nthis \u201cNewspaper Office\u201d as it has\nbeen branded by the Union, is now\nour permanent home. We have\nalready moved in, put posters up on\nthe walls, littered the floors with coffee cups and used it as an impromptu\nchanging room.\nHowever, just like Rome, the West\nBasement refurbishment didn\u2019t happen in a day. It didn\u2019t even happen in\na month, but has taken the best part\nof this last year to complete. Even\non Friday, as we had our first team\nof excited section editors in to lay\nout the pages, contractors were still\nputting up blinds and messing with\ncables.\nThis issue almost didn\u2019t happen\ntoo. At one point we decided to miss\nout this issue, and power through\ninto next Friday, restore ourselves\nback to our usual routine and take\na well-deserved break after the first\nissue that nearly killed our team. Apparently, making a paper using only\none computer without an office is a\nnightmare. Who knew?\nBut after an inebriated Alex Savell\nstumbled down to the office just under a week ago now, and convinced\nme that skipping an issue is a stupid\nidea, we were back on track. Savell\nstumbled away, and I hastily pinged\nemails out to everyone, calling them\nto arms (or rather, to Issue 1583).\nWe even managed to visit a few\nballs, interview a few celebrities, and\nmake a few new friends at Freshers\u2019\nFair at our very first meet and greet.\nWe\u2019ve welcomed a host of new section editors, writers and copy editors\nto our team, which is exciting!\nOur new home would have been\nimpossible to inhabit if it wasn\u2019t\nfor the great work of the students\nwho have spent the last few weeks\ndown here in the basement, setting everything up. Massive thanks\nto Max Hunter, George Butcher,\nLuke Granger-Brown, Cem Hurrell,\nHenry Whittaker, Philip Kent, Ethan\nHaley and everyone else who has\ncome down and sat soldering, moving boxes, unpacking hundreds of\nrecords and CDs and everything else\nthat needed to be done to get in here\non time.\nIt\u2019s been a crazy fortnight and we\ncan\u2019t rest yet: Felix will be going to\nprint twice this week. We are out\ntoday, on Monday, and if all goes to\nplan again on Friday. Don\u2019t say we\nnever do anything for you guys\nEnjoy this issue, be gentle if you\nspot some last minute errors, and let\nus know how you think we did. In\nthe meantime, send coffee donations\nto the basement, as once this issue\nhits the stands, we are straight back\ninto the office to make another.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFELIX EDITOR\nCURRENT VACANCIES\nCentrefold photographer\nemail felix@imperial.ac.uk if\nyou are interested in this role.\nWondering where our website has gone?\nFelixOnline currently under construction.

Photo: Felix\nFood\nMichelle Tan talks curry & being a Third Culture Kid\nQuick curry-basics cheatsheet\nNew ideas aplenty...\nstarring YOU!\nCAROL ANN CHEAH\nSECTION EDITOR\nEh-up,Imperialites\u2013welcome back to another\ninstalment of Felix Food! The weather\u2019s turned turtle\nand it seems all of us in my flat have fallen victim to\nsome form of Freshers\u2019Flu (despite not being fresh-ers,pah.) That said,however,it\u2019s perfect weather for\nall the comfort foods we associate with winter: stews,\nmash,soups...and dare I say it,hot puddings (obvi-ously with more than a side of custard!)\nThis week we\u2019re trying out something new where\nwe feature a profile of one of the die-hard foodies\nhere at Imperial every fortnight/month.It\u2019s called\nFoodie InSight just because you can read it both\nas\u201cinsight\u201dor\u201cin sight\u201d\u2013yes,I do love my lame\ndual-meanings and puns,if you haven\u2019t realized by\nnow.I know there are loads of you foodies out there\nwaiting to have your say,and it\u2019s nice to have a look\nhow everyone\u2019s tastes differ throughout the student\npopulation.Our featured foodie this week (Mich)\nis great with curry and making almost all her own\nmeals; however,maybe there\u2019s another foodie out\nthere who\u2019s better at European food and eating out\ncheaply? We\u2019d love to hear from you,and what tips\nyou have for us!\nIn other foodie-related happenings,I went to a\ncoffee cupping event (cupping\u2019s just a fancy word\nfor tasting) for the first time ever at Pact Coffee HQ\n\u2013most who know me will know that they\u2019re my favorite coffee wing(wo)men.Some of you may already\nbe of the opinion that specialty coffee tastings are\u201cas\npretentious\u201das wine tastings; I have very little knowledge of that,so I can\u2019t comment.I can say however\nthat the atmosphere of this cupping was anything\nbut snobby,and most of us were just lay coffee drinkers (not experts with super-refined palates).\nIt was Brazillian coffee on offer so we learned a lot\nabout its characteristics,and what was happening\nthere...apparently there\u2019s a serious drought that\u2019s\nwrecked a fair bit of the harvest and caused production for the year to drop about 25% or so.Coffee\u2019s one\nof those finicky things that\u2019s very easily affected by\nweather and disease,which has quite a far-reaching\nhumanitarian effect on the farmers and their fami-lies.Really sad,so next time you have that cuppa do\nspare a thought for the farmers that work so hard!\nOn that note,I\u2019m going to sign off this editorial.\nHope you enjoy some of Mich\u2019s tips and recommendations for curry and a GLP (great little place) to visit\nhere in London! Look out for something a bit more up\nthe cocktail-themed alley next week...\nMICHELLE TAN\nFOOD WRITER\nHey, my name is...Michelle\nI'm from...Malaysia, but I\u2019ve never\nlived there! Right now home is\nBangkok, Thailand.\nAnd I study...Chemistry\nMy university meal habits...I\nusually cook all 3 meals a day.\nCooking for me is less of a chore;\nit\u2019s more an opportunity for me to\ntry out all the recipes I have stacked\nup in my bookmarks folder. On the\nweekends I take a break, and I like to\npick out a caf\u00e9/restaurant I have on\nmy never-ending list of places to try\nin London.\nI get most of my food inspiration\nfrom...my mum and grandmother,\nfor Malaysian food and Asian food\nin general. They have taught me\nhow to make the standard curry,\nrendang, kaya (coconut jam) and kueh\n(traditional sweets) but with their\nown personal twists. I\u2019ll admit it is\na bit difficult to find some of the\ningredients here and sometimes\nI\u2019ll need to make substitutions, but\nif I ever crave food from \u201chome\u201d,\nI\u2019d be able to whip it up quickly.\nThankfully, I\u2019ve stocked up well on\ncurry pastes and packet sauces from\nthe local supermarkets in Malaysia\nfor any emergencies.\nFoods/foodie gadgets I can't live\nwithout...I can\u2019t live without my\nblender! I\u2019m a huge fan of making my\nown green juices as they can be pretty\nexpensive from juice bars in London.\nBut that\u2019s not the only thing you can\nmake in there, though! From soups to\nsalad dressings, even quick pestos and\nhummus...the world is your oyster.\nA fond childhood food-related\nmemory...Whilst I was still living\nin Hong Kong (you can tell I\u2019m a\ntrue Third Culture Kid by now) we\nused to frequent the rainforest caf\u00e9\nat Festival Walk. The theme of the\nrestaurant is just so kid friendly and\nwhen I walked past the Piccadilly\nCircus branch the other day; it\nbrought back all my happy memories\nas a kid growing up in Hong Kong.\nMy biggest food vice...I cannot say\nno to bread! The smell of it wafting\nthrough any bakery in London just\ndraws me in. I can never find the\nsame quality back home. If I have\ntime and temperatures permit my\nbread to rise, I like to bake my own.\nAn added bonus is my house smells\namazing afterwards!\nSomeone famous I'd like to have a\nlunch date with...Jose Andres, who is\na Spanish avant-garde chef and one of\nthe first few chefs to bring molecular\ngastronomy to America. He earned\nhis fame caramelizing olive oil\nand even turning potato chips into\nfoam. I\u2019d love to ask where he got his\ninspiration from to change people\u2019s\nmindset on food, and to discuss\nhow food consumption isn\u2019t just for\nthe sake of providing nutrition but\nproviding customers with a unique\nexperience.\nMy funniest food gaffe...I was\nbeing ambitious and wanted to make\nmyself some Thai green curry with\nsome curry paste I brought from\nhome. Little did I know that this\none little sachet had the potency of\nlike\u202615 small green chilies. Without\ntasting the paste I decided I needed\nabout half the pack to make a portion\nfor myself. When I took the first bite\nI had a flashback to when I had bitten\ninto a small green chili thinking it\nwas a vegetable, the pain and the heat\nis indescribable. No matter how much\nwater I downed I could not get rid of\nthe burning sensation. I just laughed\nat myself, all the while downing\nmultiple cups of milk, water or just\nany cold liquid I could find. Lesson\nlearnt \u2013 taste while cooking and never\nunderestimate the Thais\u2019 ability to\ntolerate spice!\nWhat I love about (good) food...\nHow it has the ability to bring back\nold memories from when I used to eat\ncertain foods as a kid, i.e. McDonald\u2019s\napple pie (my absolute favourite) or\nbaking a lemon meringue pie that I\nused to bake often for my best friends\nback home.\nI don\u2019t just love cooking for myself,\nI like cooking for others. It makes\nme happy to be able to share the joy\nof food with others and I love how it\nalways brings people together. I\u2019m a\nhuge fan of Christmas and Christmas\ndinner is my favorite meal to make.\nWhenever it nears that time of\nthe year I\u2019m just eager to get in the\nkitchen and start cooking. Thankfully\nI have my housemates to help share\nthe joy, especially when it comes to\nmaking and eating the desserts! I\u2019m\nalways open to trying new things and\n(sneakily) getting tips from other\npeople when I try their food.\nAll good curry starts with a\nbase that includes fragrant\nbulb veg., chillies and some\naromatics. To make mine I blend together onions, lemongrass and dried\nchillies, then fry it all together with\ncurry leaves \u2013 a mainstay of Southeast\nAsian curries \u2013 until fragrant. Then\nadd to this mixture chili and curry\npowders, to taste/tolerance levels.\nIt\u2019s easy to scale this up in batches\nand then separate into your desired\nportion sizes before freezing. A cheap\ncompact blender will do the job \u2013 no\nneed for a fancy Vitamix \u2013 and you\ncan use it for so many other things as\nwell. I own a lovely turquoise one by\nBreville which costs about \u00a340.\nI prefer not to salt this mixture\nunless I\u2019m going to use this straighta-way, as I usually pre-season my meat\nbefore I add it to the curry base. This\ngives more control over the level of\nsaltiness, and I can then use the same\nbase for many different types of meat.\nAfter you add your meat to the base\nand mix thoroughly, top it up with\nliquid (usually water) and simmer until the meat is tender. Add a bit more\nwater if you like your sauce thinner,\nless if you prefer it thicker; just make\nsure you check the seasoning. Most\ncurries get their creaminess from the\naddition of some coconut milk \u2013 use a\nlittle less than you think you\u2019ll need,\nas it\u2019ll reduce and then thicken up.\nRemember you can always add, but ye\ncannae take away!\nMalaysians tend to eat curries with\nflavored rice, such as nasi biryani (with\ncardamom, cumin and turmeric) or\nnasi lemak (creamy rice with coconut\nmilk/oil.) They\u2019re super-easy to make;\njust add the spices to the cooking\nwater before you boil your rice on\nthe stove (or flick your rice cooker\nswitch.) For nasi lemak, just swap out\nsome of the water for coconut milk.\n\"I love...\nhow [food]\nalways\nbrings\npeople\ntogether\"\nMich\u2019s Great Little Place\n\"You can\nalways\nadd, but\nye cannae\ntake away!\"\nFresh Healthy Eating Caf\u00e9,51 Lexington Street\nUnderground:PiccadillyCircus,LeicesterSquare\nI was pleasantly surprised by the large array of salad\nboxes,wraps,sandwiches and juices.There\u2019s also a\nhuge blackboard with over 40 juice combinations to\nchoose from.I always find myself needing to stare at\ntheir menu for at least 5 minutes before ordering,as\nI\u2019m so spoilt for choice! They are reasonably priced,so\nif you are ever looking for a cheap,healthy meal out\nthis is definitely the place I would recommend.\n\n"

The\nAgency decides which medicines can\ngo on sale in countries in the EU,\nand at first look, this policy seems\ncompletely sensible.\nClinical trials need to be analysed\nand available for researchers\nand doctors, to let us know if the\nmedicines we use actually work. It\nmay come as a surprise then, that\naround 50%of all the trial data for\nmedicines currently in use has not\nbeen published. This figure comes\nfrom a systematic review done by\nthe NHS NIHR Health Technology\nAssessment Programme in 2010,\nand also found that trials with\npositive results are twice as likely to\nbe published as those with negative\nresults.\nIn this way, drug companies can\nhide trials that demonstrate nasty\nside-effects and that their medicines\nmay not always work effectively,\nleading to disastrous results for\npatients.\nHowever, the EMA\u2019s policy has\nbeen criticised by Members of\nthe European parliament and\nthe AllTrials campaign, which is\ndedicated to getting trial results\npublished, for not going far enough.\nAs it will apply only after 2015, it\nwill not make a difference for the\nvast majority of the drugs currently\nin use, most of which came onto the\nmarket more than ten years ago.\nThe terms of use of EMA\u2019s\npolicy that must be signed up to by\nresearchers also includes a statement\nthat allows trial sponsors to take\nlegal action against them if they\nare suspected of misusing the data.\nAccording to the AllTrials campaign\nthis introduces a significant risk of\nresearchers \u201cbeing made vulnerable\nto protracted legal battles with large\ncompanies which will introduce a\nnew and unpredictable risk of high\nlegal costs into routine academic\nwork\u201d.\nResearchers at Imperial have\ntaken pictures to show\nhow a protein made by the\ngene BRCA2, which has long been\nimplicated in the development of\nmany types of cancer (including breast,\novarian and prostate), works to repair\ndamaged DNA.\nAround 1 in 1000 people in the UK\ncan potentially harbour a mutated\nform of the BRCA2 gene, with the\nlifetime risk of breast cancer for\nwomen with BRCA2 mutations being\n40-85%, compared to 12%for women\nin the general population who do not\nhave the mutated form of BRCA1 or\nBRCA2.\nBRCA2, a tumour suppressor gene,\nwas first identified by scientists\nfunded by Cancer Research UK in the\n1990s. Since then, we have known how\nthe gene helps to prevent cells from\ngrowing and dividing too rapidly in\nan uncontrolled manner. BRCA2\ndoes this by producing a protein\n(the BRCA2 protein) that is directly\ninvolved in the repair of damaged or\nfaulty DNA. The BRCA2 protein is\nalso known to interact with proteins\nproduced from several other genes,\nmost notably RAD51 and PALB2\ngenes, to mend breaks in DNA. Such\nbreaks in the DNA could be due to\nnatural causes (such as environmental\nexposures) or artificial causes\n(medical imaging or nuclear radiation\nexposure); but, by helping repair of\nthe DNA the BRCA2 gene plays an\nimportant role in maintaining fidelity\nof a cell\u2019s genetic information.\nThe research project led by\nProfessor Xiaodong Zhang, from the\nDepartment of Medicine at Imperial,\nand Dr Stephen West, from Cancer\nResearch UK London Research\nInstitute, has used electron microscopy\nand protein purification to reveal the\nstructure of the BRCA2 protein and\nshow how it interacts with the RAD51\nprotein and DNA.\nThe study unveils that the 3,418\namino acid BRCA2 protein facilitates\nthe nucleation of RAD51 filaments\nat multiple sites on single-stranded\nDNA. Furthermore, 3D electron\nmicroscopy reconstructions also\nreveal how the BRCA2 protein exists\nOn top of this, the information in\nthe reports is not as transparent as it\nappears\u2014the EMA still reserve the\nright to take out any information that\ncould be of \u201cconfidential commercial\nimportance\u201d to pharmaceutical\ncompanies, and not indicate where or\nwhat information has been removed,\npotentially leaving it open to the kind\nof concealment seen in the lack of\npublication of negative results.\nDespite these shortcomings, the\npolicy is at least a significant step\nforward by a major organisation to\nshift focus onto more open-access\nclinical data. This current version\nhas also come a long way since\nit was initially proposed earlier\nthis year, with a ridiculous caveat\nthat researchers would not be able\nto annotate, print off, save, copy\nor share any of the information\ncontained in these, sometimes\nthousands of pages long documents.\nAlthough many pharmaceutical\ncompanies are nervous about this\nincreased transparency, some are\nactually for it \u2014 GlaxoSmithKline, for\ninstance have said \u201cthe more eyes on\nour data the better for us\u201d. Hopefully\nthe success of this policy will lead to\nmore transparency in the future.\nSimulated image of the BRCA2\nprotein Photo: Wiki Commons\nas a dimer and two oppositely oriented\nsets of RAD51 molecules bind to this\ndimer; this complex then searches out\nmatching strands of DNA in order to\nrepair the break. This gives us a better\nidea of how exactly the homologous-recombination repair works and also\nopens new pathways for possible\nfurther research as well.\nProfessor Zhang, co-leader of the\nstudy, explained how \u201cthis study\nimproves our understanding of a\nfundamental cause of cancer [and]\ngives us a platform to design new\nexperiments to probe its mechanism\nin greater detail.\u201d Hopefully, we\nare not far off from translating this\nknowledge into tangible benefits for\npatients.\nDOI: 10.1038/nsmb.2899\n\n"

Kurdish fighters\narmed with western weapons and\nsupported by US airstrikes have\nnot stopped ISIS\u2019s advance as we\nhoped they would. Letting ISIS win\nthe war in Iraq would mean death\nand displacement for the religious\nminorities in northern Iraq and\nwould destabilise the entire region.\nIraq needs a larger, more advanced\narmy and only the West can provide\nthat. The West should send a\nmultilateral task force into Northern\nIraq to fight with the Kurds and push\nback the advance of ISIS.\nThis will work because, although\nISIS are strong enough to win a war\nagainst Kurdish and Iraqi fighters,\nthey will crumble when faced with\na better funded force such as the\nBritish or US army. For a group such\nas ISIS, their support relies on them\ncontinuing to win. The romance, as\nit is to some, of an Islamic State will\nfade when they start losing battles to\nthe \u2018infidels\u2019.\nThis is not the same as the Iraq War\n10 years ago. We are not invading\nto remove an established leader like\nSaddam Hussein, we are intervening\nto expel a foreign threat.\nThe people of Iraq do not want ISIS,\nand minorities \u2013 such as the Yazidis\n\u2013 see them as an existential threat.\nISIS has no major allies to come to\nits aid and scant support amongst\nthe civilians they now control. A\nliberation force would be welcomed\nas long as it was made clear it was a\ntemporary measure.\nExpelling ISIS from Iraq would\ndeliver the kind of defeat to the\nterrorist group that would destroy its\nmomentum and cause its members\nto lose faith in the leadership. A\ndefeated ISIS would descend into\ninfighting within Syria that would\nstop it becoming a serious external\nthreat again.\nSome may argue that it is the job\nof the Middle East to solve its own\nproblems. However the powers that\nexist in the Middle East are not ready\nto solve this problem.\nIran is the only military force\npowerful enough to tackle ISIS, but\nan intervention from Iran without\nthe support of Saudi Arabia would be\nseen as provocative. However support\nfrom Saudi Arabia is unlikely,\nespecially in the short term. The\nsituation calls for fast action and only\nthe West can provide that.\nIf ISIS are allowed to advance\nthousands more civilians might die\nby their hands and even more will\nsuffer under their rule.\nAs a nation partly responsible for\ncreating conditions in which they\ncould thrive we must intervene\nto prevent further atrocities.\nFurthermore, we are unique in the\nworld in our capacity and willingness\nto combat ISIS. It is for all these\nreasons that we should intervene in\nIraq.\nThe self-declared Islamic State\nis clearly an enemy to the life\nand liberty of people across\nthe world. They are most directly a\nthreat to those who live in Iraq, Syria\nand neighbouring countries. They\nclearly need to be stopped, but not by\nwestern military intervention.\nIn the most perfect outcome for\nany intervention in Iraq, ISIS will\nstill exist in Syria. If ISIS is somehow\nremoved from civil-war torn Syria,\nit will still exist in Algeria, Libya and\nLebanon. This thriving organisation,\nagainst the backdrop of perceived US\nled attacks on the Middle East, will\ndoubtless have a far easier task of\nrecruitment.\nDespite having the intent of aiding\nthe Iraqi government, the US and\nEuropean presence in the conflict\ngalvanises the anti-western ideology\nthat is needed for ISIS\u2019s survival.\nIt is clear that ISIS want a military\nresponse in the region. The tactic of\nkidnap and murder is coupled with\nan online media strategy that begs for\nwestern reprisal.\nISIS wants a US military\nintervention. At the point where\nthe conflict is no longer with\nthe democratically elected Iraqi\ngovernment, but instead against a\nforeign aggressor, ISIS can portray\nitself as a movement of the people.\nThe Iraqi government army can beat\nthis opponent, but is currently losing\nmore and more troops to propaganda.\nThe years of wars in the Middle\nEast has led to a less than warm\nfeeling towards the US and European\ngovernments among most people.\nAdditional foreign airstrikes do not\nbestow any trust on your would-be\nallies. They give ISIS even more\nopportunity to portray the elected\nIraqi government as being in cahoots\nwith invaders.\nAirstrikes that aim to strategically\ndestroy the ability of ISIS to continue,\nalso destroy the ability of civilians to\ncontinue to live their lives. Targets\nof strategic importance are things\nthat ISIS need to travel, support and\nsupply themselves. Depots, roads,\nand communal buildings are all\ndestroyed in airstrikes.\nInnocent civilians are also killed.\nIslamic State troops integrate\nthemselves and their equipment\nwithin towns. It is impossible to\nattack the strategic targets and troops\nwithout endangering the lives of\ninnocent people.\nIt is true that strategic airstrikes\nhinders ISIS at this instant. It may, at\nbest, stop ISIS from returning to these\nareas. But the real fight is against an\nideology. When a community loses\nthe infrastructure it needs, there will\nbe those from that community who\ndo not blame ISIS, instead many will\nbuy into the tales that they are being\ntold by ISIS themselves.\nTroops on the ground lead to even\nmore chance of catastrophically fatal\nerrors, especially when the enemy is\nnot clearly noticeable amongst the\nlocal populace.\nOur experience in Iraq that led to\nthe creation of ISIS shows that troops\nalienate and anger many people.\n\"A\nliberation\nforce\nwould be\nwelcomed.\"\n\"ISIS want\na military\nresponse in\nthe region\"\nYES NO\nThe app for students featuring College information,\nUnion news, course timetables and much more.\nLatest features include department computer availability,\nLibrary account information and classroom clicker.\nImperialMobile\nDownload\n\u2192 www.imperial.ac.uk/imperialmobile\nOliver Wyman is a leading global management consulting firm that\ncombines deep industry knowledge with specialised expertise in\nstrategy, operations, risk management, and organisation transformation.\nWith offices in 50+ cities across 25 countries, Oliver Wyman works with\nthe CEOs and executive teams of Global 1000 companies.\nAnequal opportunityemployer.\ndiscover\nour WOrld\npresentation\nSir AlExAndEr FlEminG BuildinG, impEriAl COllEGE\nmOndAy, 13th OCtOBEr\n6.30pm FOr A 7pm StArt\nTo pre-register for the event please visit www.oliverwyman.com/LondonPresentation\napplicationdeadlines\nNow accepting applications for full-time consultant and summer intern positions.\n2nd November for December 2014 offers\n14th December for February 2015 offers\n18th January 2015 for summer internships\nApply online at oliverwyman.com/careers\ninvites you to\ndiSCOVEr Our WOrld\nand learn about the unique opportunities at\nOliver Wyman that will accelerate your career.\nIn my sixth form, one student\nnoticed two things: (1) A river\nboat which did river tours by\nday had a bar and (2) Durham Police\ndon\u2019t have a marine division.

I\u2019d say that\nwas more inappropriate than some\nmildly offensive tweets.\nIn the media\u2019s defence, we do\noccasionally get the heart-warming\nstory of the \u2018geek done good\u2019. The\n\u201c Teenager comes up with bestselling app whilst bored in school\u201d\nkind of stories. I hate those stories.\nThey always seem to patronise the\ninventor, to be written by reporters\nwho obviously have no idea how the\nthing works and are filled with the\nsame dull questions. \u201cWhat do your\nfriends think? How come you\u2019re so\nclever? Are you socially retarded?\u201d\nI like to think as the media gets\nyounger/more diverse this will\nbegin to change. It has to, otherwise\nyounger generations will just get their\nnews and analysis from elsewhere.\nLet\u2019s hope that news starts to treat\nyoung people more fairly, or at\nthe very least that younger news\norganisations can start to pick on\nolder people too.\nNext week Felix should trace\nthrough the tweets from college\nlecturers and print the juiciest, or\nmaybe we\u2019ll invite a few on a pub\ncrawl then print pictures of them\ndrunk with traffic cones on their\nheads.\nYou have been warned.\nIt\u2019s time the news started to treat us fairly\nUnruly medics or students being students?

Photo: Beatrice the Biologist\nwww.beatricebiologist.com\nWhat\u2019s up, Imperial? In the\nspirit of Mental Health\nAwareness Week, I think\nit\u2019s high time we had a quick chat\nabout mental illness. First of all, I\nwant to come right off the bat and\nsay that I am in no way an expert,\nor a mental health professional of\nany kind, and everything I write\nabout is based purely off of my own\nexperiences, and those of others who\nhave felt comfortable enough to share\ntheir experiences with me. That being\nsaid, you shouldn\u2019t need to be an\nexpert to talk about something that\naffects approximately 1 in 6 adults at\nany given time.\n\u201cDiba, surely if it was that serious,\nmore people would be talking about\nit!\u201d You\u2019d probably be saying right\nabout now if this weren\u2019t a written\narticle, and I would be inclined to\nagree. The reason, hypothetical\nperson in my head, is because\nunfortunately, thanks to gross\nmisrepresentation of mental illness\nand those suffering from it in the\nmedia, and just a generally poor\nunderstanding of various mental\nhealth problems, there is huge stigma\nattached to them.\nThis stigma makes it very difficult\nfor people to openly discuss mental\nhealth problems without the fear of\nbeing judged or even jeopardising\ntheir friends, family, and careers.\nWhen we don\u2019t feel safe enough\nto discuss such critical matters,\nthen things tend to just get worse\nand worse, and the stigma never\ndisappears.\nStigma is bred from common\nmisconceptions held by a\nfrighteningly large number of people,\nsuch as those who accuse people of\n\u2018making it all up for attention\u2019, or\nclassify mental health sufferers as\nviolent. Not only is this extremely\nsad, it\u2019s also so incredibly inaccurate\nthat I want to slap each and every one\nof these people across the face with a\ncopy of the largest psychiatry book I\ncan find in the hopes that some of the\ninformation will seep in.\nNow, joking aside, as much as I\nwould love to take the moral high\nground and say that I\u2019ve always been\nsome open-minded, enlightened,\nprogressive advocate of social justice\n(or something potentially less\ncontroversial), it just wouldn\u2019t be\ntrue. Because I was also bombarded\nwith countless accounts of people\nwith schizophrenia or bipolar\ndisorders \u201c committing acts of\nviolence\u201d on TV, or heard people\nwith depression being told to just\n\u201cget a grip\u201d, as if those three words\nwould magically cure them. I was\nnever exposed to open dialogue about\nmental health, was only ever told that\nsome people are just crazy and should\nbe avoided, no questions asked. That\u2019s\nneither true nor is it acceptable\nbehaviour, and it needs to stop!\nWhat we need to do is stop avoiding\nthe issues of mental health and talk\nabout the facts as candidly as we can,\nbecause suffering from a mental\nillness doesn\u2019t make you any less of a\nperson, nor does it suddenly render\nyou incapable of leading a normal\nlife.\nNow that we\u2019ve established that,\nand listened to my little, probably\none-off, rant, let\u2019s get down to\nbusiness. What do I hope to achieve\nfrom all this? Well, I simply want us\nto start talking about it, and to spread\naccurate information about mental\nhealth issues.\nBy sharing both facts and real-life experiences (if and only if you\nfeel safe doing so, of course), we can\nslowly eradicate what seems like\ncenturies of stigma, to allow those of\nus in need of help to come forward\nand receive the support we need\nwithout the added fear of judgement\non top of everything else.\nMental health\nhelplines\nand resources\nWant to talk about mental health and other welfare issues? Why not try writing for the brand new\nwelfare section!\nSend in your ideas and articles to felix@imperial.ac.uk\nAnonymous submissions are more than welcome if you want to share your experiences without having your name\nattached to them\n\n"

The\nBarbican's Constructing Worlds draws\non the seemingly endless supply of\narchitectural photographers, as well\nas the discerning tastes of curators\nAlona Pardo and Elias Redstone,\nproviding us with a wide-ranging\noverview of this fruitful history.\nWe begin with Berenice Abbott,\nwhose five year project, Changing New\nYork, documents the rapid expansion\nof the city during the 1930s. These\nsumptuous black and white images\ncontain the germ of modern city\nphotography, and alone stand as\ntestament to Abbott\u2019s genius. In\nthese stark, angular constructions\ngirders and pipes burst out of the\nManhattan bedrock, twisting up like\nvines to form a modern metropolis.\nAlthough a contemporary and\nfriend of Abbott, Walker Evans\u2019\nphotos could not be more different\nin tone. Hired by the Farm Security\nAdministration to research rural\nAmerica, Evans documented the\ndebilitating effects of the Great\nDepression on sharecroppers. Using a\nmix of portraiture and architecture,\nthe links between buildings and\ntheir inhabitants are subtly revealed:\nbetween vernacular churches and\ndecaying plantation houses overrun\nwith black mould, Evans creates a\nheady combination of rot and ruin\nthat matches any Southern gothic\nwritten by Tennessee Williams.\nEvans\u2019 methodical approach\nmirrors the work of Hilla and Bernd\nBecher, whose quietly powerful\ndocumentation of German water\ntowers reveals the unseen design that\nsurrounds us every day. Meanwhile,\nLucien Herve explores a slightly\nmore ostentatious piece of design\n\u2013 Le Corbusier\u2019s master plan of\nChandigarh, built as a shining beacon\nof Indian modernity. Used to help\ncommunicate Le Corbusier\u2019s artistic\nvision, Herve\u2019s work is exhaustive\nin its volume. Thankfully some of\nhis best pieces have been singled\nout: explorations of shape, light,\nand volume, they don\u2019t resemble\nbuildings so much as constructivist\ncompositions.\nJulius Shulman continues this\ntheme of documentation with his\nphotographs of the Case Study House\nProgram, in which aggressively\nmodernist houses compete with\nretrograde mid-century furnishings\nto paint a picture of American\nconvenience. In Case Study House\n#22, his most celebrated photo, two\nwomen in elegant ball gowns are\nlounging on tasteful sofas, suspended\nin a glass cube above a panorama of\nthe downtown LA sprawl.\nAs the exhibition continues to the\nlower galleries, we experience the\nwork of architectural practice Office\nKGDVS, who have transformed the\nspace into a series of interlocking\nshapes, highlighting the dramatic\nimpact architecture and design can\nhave on the viewer. As the focus\nmoves away from America, and\nbecomes more modern, the work\nlooks less at the built environment\nand more at social fabric.\nSome artists featured are\nunabashedly conceptual, such as\nLuisa Lambri, who reduces the\nvast masterpiece of Frank Lloyd\nWright\u2019s Fallingwater into a single\nshaft of light, completely ignoring\nthe impressiveness of the original\nstructure. Helene Binet has more\nsuccess with her studies of Daniel\nLiebskind\u2019s Jewish Museum; but then\nagain, it is near impossible to take a\npoor photo of a building steeped in\nsuch deconstructivist drama.\nLuckily, we also have a selection\nof Hiroshi Sugimoto\u2019s work; by far\nthe best conceptual work in the\ngallery, Sugimoto reduces famous\nbuildings down to a mere black and\nwhite impression, obscured and out\nof focus, as though viewed through\na thick fog. Rather than reducing\nthe impact these building have, this\ninstead highlights the architect\u2019s\noriginal intentions when it comes to\nform and shape.\nEd Ruscha and Stephen Shore\nprovide a much needed hit of wry\nhumour with their work, which\nexplored the unsettling banality of\neveryday America. In Ruscha\u2019s case,\nthis translates to vast photographs\nof car parks, taken from helicopter,\nthe repetitive blocks building up a\npattern on the ground; a modern day\nshopping-mall Nazca. Shore\u2019s work\ncentres around small towns in the\nAmerican South, which could easily\nall be called Uncanny Valley, and\nhighlight the mundane. Underneath\nthe bright, saturated colours, lies an\nair of menace, as if Twin Peaks had\nbeen relocated to Texas.\n\"Nadav\nKander's\nexploration\nof urban\ngrowth is\nboth awe-inspiring\nand\nhorrific\"\nTowards the second half of the\nexhibition, the focus broadens in\nscope, moving away from America,\ninstead looking towards the new\nmegacities springing up in Asia,\nAfrica, and South America. Guy\nTillim\u2019s exploration of modernist\nurban decay in Southern Africa \u2013\nnamed Avenue Patrice Lumumba,\nafter the murdered Congolese\npolitician \u2013 is particularly interesting,\nshowing us a view of Africa that is far\nfrom typical. Sadly the same cannot\nbe said for Simon Norfolk, whose\nseries Chronotropia and Burke Norfolk\nportray Afghanistan as largely a land\nof terror and ruined buildings, a\nrhetoric spouted on a near daily basis\nin any national newspaper.\nA highlight is the work of Nadav\nKander, whose exploration of urban\ngrowth and massive construction\nalong the Yangtze River in China\nis both awe-inspiring and horrific.\nA mighty river, which once ran\nturbulently for nearly 4000\nmiles, is now placid, thanks to the\nconstruction of the Three Gorges\nDam during the late 1990s; as\nenormous bridges are erected in the\nbackground families sit and picnic\non the banks; fishermen haul in their\ncatch, seemingly oblivious to the high\nlevels of pollution and industrial\nrun-off.\nThe task of curating a retrospective\non the link between photographers\nand architects was always going to\nbe difficult, and Pardo and Redstone\nhave done well to select just 18\nartists. While the quality and depth\nof the work displayed somewhat\nvaries \u2013 with a strong North\nAmerican start gives way to a more\nscattered international reach \u2013 the\nexhibition is unmissable for anyone\nwith even a scant interest in either\nmedium. What with the Barbican\u2019s\narchitectural beauty (although some\nwould contest this), there is hardly a\nmore perfect place for a study of this\nmost natural of relationships.\nFormer Soviet-era 'Palace of Culture', Kabul, Simon Norfolk Photo: Simon Norfolk\nRomance and Ruins at the Royal Academy\nAnselm Kiefer is not an\nartist to approach in half\nmeasures. When I read\nthat, in 1992, he turned his 35 acre\nstudio in Barjac, France, into a giant\nGesamtkunstwerk comprised of\nstorerooms, installations, paintings,\nunderground chambers, corridors,\nstriking glass structures and huge\nlead sculptures, I thought that maybe,\nin the pretty, well presented halls of\nthe Royal Academy of Art (RAA), a\ncertain undertone of Kiefer\u2019s work\nmay well be lost on me. It wasn\u2019t.\nEven without the magnificent\nstructures in which Kiefer originally\npresented his works, the full spectrum\nof Kiefer\u2019s creations do not fail to\ncompletely shock and awe its audience with horrific, twisted motifs and\ndark philosophical stories, creating an\noverwhelmingly powerful critique of\nKiefer\u2019s chosen subjects.\nIn this first major retrospective\nof Kiefer\u2019s work, the RA has\ncollaborated closely with the artist\nto present some of his most famous\nworks, alongside installations created\nspecifically for this show, and some of\nhis lesser known works in books and\nwatercolours.\nA truly spectacular experience, this\nretrospective beautifully presents\nthe full breadth of Kiefer\u2019s work and\nshows the intricate and philosophical\ndevelopment of his inspirations and\nmotifs over the years in an intelligent\nand powerful exhibition.\nCurated by Kathleen Soriano, the\nshow is largely chronological and\nopens with Kiefer\u2019s earliest work in\nthe late 1960s while he was studying\nunder the realist Peter Dreher.\nRight from the get go, the\nexhibition\u2019s vision and purpose is\nclear and almost each piece links in\nbeautifully with the next. Almost\npoetically, Kiefer stays faithful to\na handful of motifs which crop\nup in almost all his work. Two of\nthese motifs explored in particular\ndetail are the German forests and\nGermany\u2019s Nazi past, present in both\nhis oldest and newest works.\nIn Kiefer\u2019s series of paintings Heroic\nSymbols (Heroische Sinnbilder),\nKiefer depicts himself in a typical\nGerman landscape performing the\nSieg Heil alongside classical figures,\ndrawn from Nazi Propaganda.\nOriginally produced as his\nfinal exam piece while studying\nin Karlsruhe, the piece shocked\nthe establishment then and still\nprovokes an extreme emotional\nresponse in some who see it. The\ncollective lack of consciousness that\nhad befallen Germany is directly\nconfronted in this series and remains\njust as relevant now as a critique of\nnationalist movements.\nAs is often the case with artists\nwho radically confront such difficult\nissues, Kiefer\u2019s earlier years saw him\nfrequently labelled as an anti-Semite.\nFor the 1980 Venice Biennale, Kiefer\nfirst presented his painting The\nPaths of World Wisdom: Hermann\u2019s\nBattle. On a dark textured forest\nbackground, Kiefer has pasted the\nblack and white images of people\ndepicted in Nazi Propaganda,\nsurrounding a small white fire. Based\non the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest\nwhere Germanic tribes defeated\nthe Roman legions, Kiefer\u2019s work\naddresses the birth of German\nnationalism and the ground on which\nGerman traditions were built, with\nthe fire expressing the opportunity\nfor the rebirth of a nation.\nDark and overwhelming, the\npainting draws on the darker side\nof German history and directly\nconfronts the silent Germany of\nKiefer\u2019s childhood. This general\nfeeling runs through the whole\nexhibition and leaves you in complete\nawe by the end.\nUp to this point I\u2019ve only really\nspoken about Kiefer\u2019s earlier work,\nand since talking about specific\npaintings or sculptures never quite\nsatisfies what I want to say about\na piece, I will leave you with one\nlast observation. The week before\nthe exhibition opened to the press,\nAnselm Kiefer came to the RAA\nand set out to produce a sculpture\nspecifically for this exhibition.\nAges of the World is a story about\nman\u2019s inability to comprehend\ngeological time, the romantic\naspirations of art, and the poetry of\nruins. Constructed from dozens of\nbroken Kiefer Canvasses, photos from\nhis past work, and lead structures,\nHeroic Symbol V (Heroisches Sinnbild V), Anselm Kiefer Photo: Collection Wuerth\nMax Falkenberg explores Anslem Kiefer\u2019s enduring influence\n\"Dark &\noverwhelm-ing, [it]\nconfronts\nKiefer's\nGermany\"\n\"Its vision\nand\npurpose\nis clear...\neach piece\nlinks in\nbeautifully\nwith the\nnext\"\nthe artwork encompasses the whole\nroom in which it has been created and\ntouches on the frailty of Earth in the\nUniverse.\nKiefer\u2019s obsession with the cyclical\nnature of time and the idea that\nscience can answer everything and\nnothing can be seen throughout every\ncrevice of this monstrous creation.\nThe lead mushrooms again draw on\nthe idea of the rebirth of a ruined\nEarth with Kiefer having stated\noften in the past that lead is the only\nsubstance which can hold the weight\nof human history.\nTogether these elements join to\ncreate a sculpture which not only\ndraws in the audience but leaves them\ncompletely mesmerised, and this\nhappens over and over again in this\nexhibition.\nEvery artwork in this retrospective\nseems to fit perfectly in its\nsurroundings and as a whole, the\nexhibition tells a beautiful story.\nWhether you like Kiefer\u2019s work or\nnot, he is undoubtedly now one of the\nworld\u2019s greatest living artists.\nInterior (Innenraum), Anselm Kiefer Photo: Collection Stedeldijk Museum\nConstructing Worlds\nBarbican Centre\nAnselm Kiefer\nThe Royal Academy of\nArts\n25 September - 11 January\n27 September - 14 December\n\n"

One girl cheekily\npoked Finn\u2019s nose, to which he\nreplied playfully \u201cYou bitch! That\u2019s\nthe only good part of me, and you\u2019re\ntrying to flatten it.\u201d\nThe set lasted a full hour and a half\nbecause Finn stayed on well past his\nscheduled time, probably to make up\nfor being slightly late. Upon leaving,\nFinn stopped to chat to the students,\nasking what they study and signed a\ncopy of \u201cA Clash of Kings\u201d for one.\nFelix caught Finn as he was leaving\nthe Union and managed to sneak in a\nfew words before he left via taxi.\nWe asked him how Season 5 filming\nis going, to which he replied that it\nwas going amazingly well. \u201cI grew\nthis beard for filming actually. I\ndon\u2019t actually know what happens to\nmy character beyond the books, but\nI can tell you that Season 5 is very\ndifferent!\u201d\nHe also told us how Kristian\nNairn, who plays Hodor, first got\nhim into DJ\u2019ing. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved\nmusic and I\u2019ve always loved making\nmy own music but he got me into\n[professional DJ\u2019ing].

This week, 750\nmilitary personnel and a medical ship\nwill be sent to Sierra Leone to help\ngive patients vital care, since many\nhospitals in the afflicted countries\nare filled to capacity. So far, the UK\nhas contributed 125 million pounds\nin support of the West African\noutbreak, which has now resulted in\n4,024 deaths.\nXUAN CHEN\nNEWS WRITER\nScreening includes checking temperatures and taking previous medical history.

But studying in a London\nuniversity has its perks for film fans,\nas the British Film Institute\u2019s (BFI)\nannual London Film Festival (LFF) is\nan event unlike any other.\nBoasting a selection of more than\n200 films from countries all over the\nworld, this year's LFF promises once\nagain to be a star-filled, jam-packed\n12-day event, one that cannot be\nmissed for those interested in the\nworld of cinema.\nThe LFF has a long, distinguished\ntradition of introducing to the public,\nmonths before their official release\ndates, quality films that then go on\nto win all sorts of awards throughout\nthe months of the Oscar season.\nPrevious years have seen premieres\nof 12 Years a Slave, The Artist, The\nKing's Speech and many more, all of\nwhich were awarded the Best Picture\nawards at the Oscars. London, armed\nwith a Leicester Square full of cinema\nscreens, is the place filmmakers and\nactors descend upon, to promote their\nwork and build up the hype.\nPublic participation is a major part\nof the festival, unlike many other\nevents that like to class themselves\nas more prestigious, in which case it\nis virtually impossible to get ahold\nof tickets. The LFF opens booking\nfor members of the public and the\nfull programme is at your disposal.\nBut it is advisable to act quickly, as\ntickets are of course limited, and\ngiven the high level of anticipation\nsurrounding certain films (mostly\nthose that star the biggest names in\nthe industry), the spare seats do not\nhang around for long.\nSo best of luck in getting your\nhands on the tickets, and jump at the\nopportunity to watch what will be\nsome of the best films of this year,\nway ahead of anyone else in the\ncountry.\nThe Imitation Game:\nOpening Night Gala\nThe Festival officially kicks off in\nOdeon Leicester Square on 8th\nOctober with the European premiere\nof The Imitation Game, starring the\nnation's favourite Sherlock, Benedict\nCumberbatch, as Alan Turing, in a\nbiopic that highlights his work in\ncracking Nazi Germany's Enigma\ncode during the Second World\nWar. Reception from Telluride and\nToronto Film Festivals has mostly\nbeen positive although not exactly\necstatic.\nThe film has already had its fair\nshare of controversy, notably the\ncasting of Keira Knightley as Turing's\none-time fianc\u00e9e, with Knightley\nbeing deemed too pretty by some,\nwhereas the film's alleged toning\ndown of Turing's homosexuality has\nalso been highlighted.\nFury: Closing Night Gala\nClosing the festival is just as\nimportant as opening it, and the\nhonour of the final night feature goes\nto yet another film set during the\nSecond World War. Fury, the David\nAyer-directed World War II drama\nstarring Brad Pitt, will be having its\nEuropean premiere on 19th October.\nVery little is known about the film's\nquality as of yet, given how the film\nis missing out on any festival action\nprior to coming to London.\nAll we have to go on for now, is the\nintense trailer that has been released,\nunderstandably putting as much\nemphasis and focus on Pitt and tank\naction as possible. It has a similar vibe\nto Lebanon, a rather excellent war film\nalso set primarily in a tank.\nThis week at Imperial Cinema\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nDirector: James Gunn\nScreenplay: Nicole Perlman\nCast: Chris Pratt,Zoe Saldana,Dave\nBautista,Vin Diesel,Bradley Cooper\nEver since IronMan in 2008,Marvel\nStudios have shown themselves\nto be one of the heavyweights\nof the film world,throwing out\nblockbuster after blockbuster of\nexceptional quality,and this year\nhas had some of the best.Both\nThor:TheDarkWorld and Captain\nAmerica:TheWinterSoldierdid\nfantastically,and whilst riding\nthis high,you get the release of\nthe rather obscureGuardiansof\ntheGalaxy.And somehow this\nunknown became by far the best of\nthe bunch.\nTake Peter Quill (Chris Pratt),an\nEarthling raised in space,throw in a\ngreen skinned assassin,a thug who\ndoesn\u2019t understand metaphors,a\ntalking racoon and a sentient tree,\nmix in some stunning visuals,a plot\nthat loves to remind you not to take\nit too seriously and a genuinely\nwonderful soundtrack,and you\ncome out withGuardians.If you\u2019ve\nseen it before,make sure to watch\nfor things in the background,there\nis a lot that you miss on the first\nviewing,And the second.And the\nthird.\nShowing18:30Tuesday14thand21:00\nThursday16th\nGodzilla\nDirector: Gareth Edwards\nScreenplay: Max Borenstein,Dave\nCallaham\nCast: Aaron Taylor-Johnson,\nElizabeth Olsen,Bryan Cranston\nSixty years after he was initially\ncreated by Tomoyuki Tanaka,\nHollywood\u2019s favourite kaiju is back\nfor his thirty-second film,and he\u2019s\nbigger than ever.\nAfter the less-than-well-received\n1998 version of the film,a reboot\nhad been on the cards for a while,\nbut it wasn\u2019t until director Gareth\nEdwards impressed the world with\nhis low budget flick Monsters that\nhe was brought in to finally get the\nthing in production.\nWhilst watching you can tell\nthat Edwards is a lover of monster\nfilms.Though he gives you time\nto get to know the characters,and\nhave some truly human moments,\nhe never forgets that most of the\npeople come to watch these sort\nof films to watch giant monsters\ndestroy things and fight.And\nwith that he absolutely delivers.\nThere isn\u2019t much in this world\nmore satisfying than watching a\n300-metre-tall ancient monster\npunch things in the face.\nShowing21:00Tuesday14thand18:30\nThursday16th\n\n"

    "content": "Sports Editor: Kunal Wagle\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIssue 1583\nVolleyball expecting great season\nThe women\u2019s team began last\nseason with less than optimal\nconditions; only few players\nfrom the previous year remained,\nand the Saturday trainings in Brixton\nnot only clashed with our coach\u2019s\ntimetable, but also made it difficult to\nattract new members.\nHowever, the effort and encouragement from many of the club\u2019s\nmembers quickly resulted in a\nnew coach being appointed for the\nwomen\u2019s team as well as great overall\nenthusiasm. The amazing spirit and\natmosphere helped the players train\nand bond as a team. Unfortunately,\nmany more challenges were to follow,\nincluding a crucial match against\nPortsmouth ending in a 2-2 tie when\ntime ran out at their venue (which\nthey strongly argued should give\nthem a win \u2013 fortunately following\nweeks of rescheduling problems \u2013 the\nmatch was re-played and won 3-0 by\nus!), or the day of the match against\nBrunel University, which, after preparing an elaborate route to get out\nof London during the infamous tube\nstrikes, was cancelled two hours before the scheduled start time. Despite\nthese and a number of similar com-plications, the team pushed through\nwith determination (and with weekly\nnights of antics at the Eastside Bar),\ncollecting enough points to win and\nfinally advance back into the 1st division of the BUCS volleyball league!\nVolleyball is definitely still an\nup-and-coming sport in the UK, as\nexplained by Emily Lehtonen, last\nyear\u2019s women\u2019s team BUCS captain.\n\u201cFor a long time after I started playing on the Imperial College Volleyball team, my friends would ask \u201cHow\nwas netball practice?\u201d Although well-intentioned, this does not go down\nwell when you dedicate a significant\nportion of your time to training for\nthe said sport. Especially after your\ncoach has had you diving across the\ncourt to receive exceedingly tricky\nserves twenty times in a row.\nThis, in addition to the general\nstereotype of \u2018babes in bikinis\u2019 on a\nbeach, which is so often attached to\nvolleyball, makes running a serious\nvolleyball club somewhat challeng-ing. However, when you play as\ntechnical and teamwork-based a sport\nas volleyball three times a week with\nthe same people, you get to know\nthem well and share some fantastic\nexperiences, such as playing matches\nat a London 2012 Olympic venue and\nexperiencing the exhilaration of a 3-0\nwin in the match that determines the\ntop-placing team in the league!\u201d\nFollowing last year\u2019s successful and,\nmore importantly, fun season, the\nclub is looking forward to welcoming\nnew and returning members.\nLast year\u2019s members are keen to\nreturn to the court as well as continue\nthe off-court excitement; with social\nevents ranging from dinners to ice\nskating, bar nights and bowling!\nThe club is open to players of all\nlevels and we therefore hope to see\nmany of you at one of our training\nsessions or social events.\nThe Volleyball Club wants to\nwelcome all Freshers to the university\nand wish you all the best as you start\nyour journey at Imperial College.\nMIREILLE RACK\nICVC PRESIDENT\nPhoto: ICU Volleyball\nKeeping the Ball Rolling in Basketball\nDid you know that basketball\nwas randomly invented on a\nrainy day in New England?\nBecause of the bad weather, students\ncouldn\u2019t play outdoor sports. A fitness education teacher thus decided\nto put two baskets on opposing ends\nof a court and a football in between.\nAs simple as it sounds, the game of\nbasketball was made. Here in England, we do not fear bad weather (but\nwe don\u2019t really like it either, do we?).\nYet, basketball is growing consider-ably. And to see this, what better place\nis there than your dear university?\nThe number of people joining the\nImperial College Basketball society\nhas doubled over the past two years.\nFrom 50 people in 2011 to 100 last\nyear, IC Basketball has asserted\nitself as one of the key sports societies at Imperial. Things were taken\nto another level last year with the\nestablishment of a new partnership\nbetween the London Lions and IC\nBasketball. The Lions compete in the\nBritish Basketball League (BBL), the\ntop men\u2019s basketball league in the UK.\nAmong the many crazy benefits from\nthe partnership, IC Basketball played\ntheir varsity game at the Copper Box,\nhome court of the Lions and Olympic\nvenue for basketball.\nIC Basketball is divided into 3\nteams: Women\u2019s (BUCS 1st Division),\nMen\u2019s 1st (BUCS 3rd Division), Men\u2019s\n2nd (BUCS 4th Division). Noticeably, the women\u2019s team enjoyed an\noutstanding season last year, winning\nboth BUCS 2nd Division and LUSL\nCup titles. Nonetheless, this division\nbetween the 3 teams does not hinder\nthe society from coming together for\nmany sports and social events. For in-CEDRIC COLLE\nPUBLICITY OFFICER\nstance, IC Basketball organises weekly\ndevelopment sessions for students\nto work on their game, or simply\nlearn all the basics. On a personal\nbasis, I was a near beginner last year.\nAttending these sessions throughout\nthe year has dramatically helped me\nto improve my game. This year, I am\nconfident that I can potentially join\none of the teams. In addition to the\nsessions, IC Basketball has previously taken part in international\ntournaments in France, Holland and\nGermany. For 2014-15, the society\nplans a year full of 4v4 mixed tourna-ments, All Star Competitions (with\ndunk, three-pointer, and free throw\ncontests), monthly socials, ACC sports\nnights and many more.\nOutside of LeBron\u2019s return to Cleveland, that\u2019s definitely something to\nlook out for this year!\nFinally, here are two facts about\nbasketball:\nFact One: 7-foot tall American\nmales have a 17% chance of playing\nin the NBA.\nFact Two: Imperial students, whatever their size, have a 100%chance of\nhaving fun with IC Basketball.\nIn case you\nmissed it...\nIn Formula One,Lewis\nHamilton won the Japanese\nGrand Prix to extend his\nChampionship lead over Nico\nRosberg.However the race was\novershadowed by a serious\ninjury to Marussia driver Jules\nBianchi.Bianchi crashed into a\nrecovery tractor and is at the time\nof writing in a critical but stable\ncondition.\nIn Cricket Kevin Pietersen has\nreleased his autobiography,in\nwhich he makes assertions about\n\u201cbullying\u201dby the bowlers in the\nEngland team.On the field,the\nChennai Super Kings won the\nChampions League in a one sided\nfinal.\nWorld number 792 Oliver\nWilson managed to beat World\nnumber one Rory McIlroy\nat the Alfred Dunhill Links\nChampionship to win his first\never title.Meanwhile Darren\nClarke is the early favourite to be\nEurope\u2019s next Ryder Cup captain.\nThe FA has suggested that\nEngland could play its games\naway from Wembley if a NFL\nteam is made for London.\nIn a move similar to that of the\n(now) MK Dons,London Wasps\nhave announced controversial\nplans to move to Coventry.\nSam Burgess helped South\nSydney to the NRL title in Rugby\nLeague.The amazing part? He\nbroke his cheekbone after six\nseconds of the match and yet\ncarried on for the full game.\nKUNAL WAGLE\nPhoto: ICU Basketball\nPhoto: Getty Images\nPhoto: Getty Images\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\n"

When I was young,\nsummers used to be an endless\nseries of screaming matches and\ncompromises so I could get to take\nadvantage of the warmest season\nwhile still enjoying an unhealthy\namount of television. However, this\nyear it only took a couple of weeks to\nrealise that summer really is not the\nseason to binge-watch anymore.\nRemember early July? We would\ntune in to catch football matches\nand tennis glories and, even better,\ndo so with a cold pint at the local\npub. With the English team\u2019s hopes\nbeing cut disappointingly short and\nAndy Murray out of Wimbledon\nbefore we\u2019d even started to get the\nPimm\u2019s out, it didn\u2019t take long\nfor that excitement to disappear.\nSoon it was evident that TV was as\nmuch on holiday as we were, except\nfor property shows and countless\nepisodes of EastEnders. The States\nfaced a similar predicament,\nsubmerging us with reality TV\nshows such as Keeping up with the\nKardashians and America\u2019s Next Top\nModel, but evidently thinking that\nnobody is going to be watching good\nTV when there are iced teas to be\ndrunk and barbeques to be fired up.\nThere were some exceptions. In\nJuly, Showtime brought back the\nsecond series of the period drama\nMasters of Sex, a shows so intense\nand well-crafted it could rival Mad\nMen if it wasn\u2019t for the painfully\nslow interactions between some\nof the most emotionally repressed\ncharacters in TV history.\nJune saw the return of HBO True\nBlood\u2018s seventh season, for those\nwho didn\u2019t already get put off by\nwerepanthers and vampire gods.\nFor those who like it short and\nsweet, the show You\u2019re the Worst\nwas maybe the most interesting\nnewcomer.\nFollowing the love lives of two\ndisillusioned and maladjusted\ntwenty-somethings, the show pulls\noff sex-jokes and hipster-bashing\nremarks with surprising ability.\nEventually August came, signifying\nthe return of hit shows The Great\nBritish Bake-off and Dr Who. With a\nbrand new Doctor and baked-Alaska\nscandals that made us see the ugly\nside of Mary Berry, these did not\ndisappoint, unlike the new Made in\nChelsea spin-off in New York City that\nfeatures the same SW7 youngsters,\nwho have given up cricket and cream\ntea in favour of hot dogs and baseball\ncaps.\nFear not, however! Autumn is here\nand it\u2019s been a long time coming (and\nI stress, in television terms alone).\nWith it comes the return of several\nbeloved series, as well as new ones to\nlook out for.\nTuesday nights (for the American\npublic, and only later for us Brits)\nwill become girls\u2019 night in, with\nFox\u2019s double whopper New Girl/The\nMindy Project. Although the first may\nhave exhausted its main character\u2019s\nrelationship fuel, the second still has\na lot to give thanks to Mindy Kaling\u2019s\nbrilliant writing.\nOn Wednesdays, the Dunphys are\nback in Modern Family, which can be\nconsumed whenever and wherever\nby anyone feeling a little homesick at\nthe start of the new term (although,\nspoiler alert, nobody\u2019s family is that\nlovable). And if glitter and cowboy\nboots are your thing, which they\nreally ought to be, watch out for the\nnew season of Nashville, coming back\nafter the ultimate cliffhanger finale.\nAs usual, Thursday nights are the\nreal deal, with all time favourites\nsuch as Bones and The Vampire Diaries\nreturning, and although some may\nargue that the producers of these\nshows are milking the plots a little,\nI\u2019m sure many of you can\u2019t wait.\nProducer Shonda Rhimes, of Grey\u2019s\nAnatomy fame, is working hard this\nyear, providing us with the most\nfollowed medical show on TV, even\nafter the departure of fan favourite\nDr Christina Yang, as well as coming\nback with Scandal and brand new\nseries How to Get Away With Murder.\nIf the past is any indication, with\nattractive and complicated main\ncharacters, gripping moral dilemmas\nand dirty secrets, we are sure How to\nGet Away with Murder will become\neveryone\u2019s new TV obsession.\nAnother newcomer that will keep\nus watching is Red Band Society. Its\ncharacters are normal adolescents\noff to discover adulthood and sex,\nonly difference is they are doing it\nfrom the wings of a hospital, also\ndealing with love and loss. The series\nis a remake of a Spanish hit show\nproduced by Steven Spielberg for\nAmerican audiences and promising\nto deal with teenage angst and drama\nin a less preppy and stereotypical\nmanner than Glee. Other classics like\nThe Big Bang Theory, American Horror\nStory and The Walking Dead are also\nback to make keeping up with lectures\nslightly less appealing.\nFinally, if you, Fresher, thought\nthat your Imperial days would be full\nof hard study sessions at the library\nand challenging tutorials, don\u2019t\nworry: they will.\nHowever, there is still plenty of TV\nto be watched and fun to be had. And\nremember, if you see a fellow student\nstreaming on Level 4, don\u2019t judge, he\u2019s\nprobably just seeking fast broadband\nand cheap heating, long forgotten\nsince the days of student halls.\n\n"

We know what\nit means. Cavers returning.\nThe kettle lets out a hisssss\nand gurgles. A tackle bag falls heavily\non the floor and we all look up. \u201cHey\nho!\u201d And conversations resume, \u201cYes\nthis word fits\u201d, \u201cWhat about fifteen\ndown ?\u201d, \u201cDoes it go?\u201d, \u201cTea is up!\u201d,\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the cow ?\u201d\nI am sat in the bivi, a large\ndepression with an overhanging rock\nbridge on the Migovec Plateau in\nthe Triglav National Park, Western\nSlovenia. From the Sunset Spot,\none can gaze all the way to Italy\nand during a clear sunset one can\neven spot the Dolomites rising in\nthe distance, shadows crowned with\nrusset light. West of Migovec is the\nKrn massif, former So\u010da front during\nWWI, sometimes wreathed in storm\nclouds while stars twinkle upon\nMigovec.\nThose are the first things I learnt\nas an expedition Fresher. Then come\nthe more prosaic rules: when and how\nto use the toilet facilities (a dignified\npit), not falling into M10 (a 30 metre\nopen pitch) when leaving the bivi at\nnight, where to pitch the tent, how\nto successfully manufacture a \u2018dwarf\npine sofa\u2019 etc...\nLiving for five weeks at 1850\nmetres of elevation, three hours\nfrom civilisation is almost as remote\nas you can get in terms of summer\nexpedition. Water? Collected with\ntarpaulins into barrels. Electricity?\nCollected via solar panels. That\u2019s the\nproblem with a \u2018hollow\u2019 mountain:\nthere are no overground streams\nfor water collection or electricity\nproduction. Food? Hunted for in\nBritish supermarkets and cooked\non petrol stoves. There is always\nthe latest teaspoon spinning device\navailable and a myriad of other\ningenious contraptions to make\nmountain life easier. To quote the\nexpedition veterans \u201cthey must\ninvent not just explore\u201d.\nI am sat in the bivi, discussing\npossible leads with the old lags\nand the returning cavers. I book\nfour nights in the underground\ncamp and start preparing my kit.\nTomorrow, another caver and I are\ngoing to explore at \u2013700m with a\nchisel, crowbar, and hammer. We\nhave a 600kg rock to shift in order\nto squeeze past. I hear tales of the\nchamber beyond, and the roar of a\nwaterfall afterwards. As excitement\nbuilds up, so does apprehension. I\u2019ve\nbeen down at underground camp,\nI\u2019ve been at the southern most point\nof the cave, a good three hours from\ncamp and from there five hours to\nthe surface. But I\u2019ve never slept at\ncamp X-Ray more than two nights in\na row, and I\u2019ve never done more than\none pushing trip. There\u2019s no knowing\nwhat you sign up for when going\npushing which is either thrilling or\nsobering.\nThe next day we set off in pair\nand walk to the cave entrance, a few\nminutes off the bivi. We enter the\ncave. 98 hours later, we make it out,\nexhausted and elated. It is four in\nthe afternoon and we enjoy the smell\nof dwarf pine mixed with earthy\nfragrances we were starting to miss.\nThe temperature is a delight after the\nubiquitous 1\u00b0C of the cave. Twenty\nminutes later we arrive at the bivi.\n\u201cHey ho!\u201d\nSilence.\n\u201cDoes it go?\u201d\n\u201cDo you want some tea?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u201d\n\u201cCow?\u201d\n\u201cNo\u201d...\n\u201cYes the cave goes, it always goes,\nthe mountain is hollow after all.\u201d\nAfter the rock was shifted \u2013 it took\nus three hours \u2013 we found a small\nchamber, at the end of which a pitch\nhead awaited us. So we rigged it the\nday after and descended into an\nactive streamway. Not the roaring\ntorrent we were expecting but some\nwater nonetheless. From then we\ncrawled into an oblique rift and\nfound another pitch head. Whilst\nclearing it of unstable boulders,\none rock shifted into the gap and\nobstructed the way on.\nThe day after, with a chisel and\ncrowbar we attacked it until it yielded\nanother chamber, more rift and a\nthird pitch. This we descended on the\nlast day, and walked down more tight\nrift, free climbing over pristine pools\nof water until we were faced with a\nlast circular shaft, seven metres deep.\nWe surveyed our finds, slept at camp\nand got out.\n\u201cShall we enter the survey data\nnow?\u201d, \u201cOf course\u201d. And little by little\nthe 150 metres or so of passage are\nadded to the grand survey. What a joy\nto see four days worth of work take\nshape before one\u2019s eyes! Where does\nit head to? Is it blank mountain? As\never we raise more questions than we\nactually answer.\nThere lies the thrill of exploration:\nmore people have been to the Moon\nthan in the passage we found.\nTomorrow though is the expedition\nD-Day. This is the final caving day\nwhen we will put the cave to sleep for\nanother year by packing up camp XRay and finally head down to Tolmin\nthe nearby town in the valley before\nthe long journey home.

Protesters\nclaim that this is a violation of\nprevious agreements, and have\nlaunched protest actions in cities\nacross the world to raise international\nawareness of what they say is\nevidence of the government riding\nroughshod over the people\u2019s wishes.\nAs well as the Occupy Central\nprotest in Hong Kong City,\nsupporters have organised action in\nSingapore, London and Manchester.\nFelix spoke to some of the Imperial\nstudents protesting in Hong Kong, as\nwell as members of HK Pass, a Union\nClub that is run by students from\nHong Kong that promotes awareness\nof Public Issues and Community Students protesting in front of the Chinese Embassy in London Photo: Ben Fernando\nBen Fernando attends the protests for democracy taking place in London\nService.\nJo Leung and Brian Yeung are two\nsuch students, both from second year.\nThey explained to Felix that they\nwere outside the Chinese Embassy\nin Portland Square on Tuesday\nnight to \u201csupport the advancement\nof democracy, the right of people to\nspeak up and to freely express their\nviews\u201d, though wanted to be clear that\nthese were their own views and not\nthose of HK Pass.\nThe protest itself was far larger\nthan expected, with organisers\nestimating that over 3,000 people,\nmostly students, had shown up to\nstage a sit-in whilst various speakers\nmade announcements about what\nthey were doing and how democracy\nin Hong Kong needed to be\ndeveloped.\nAlthough the largely peaceful\nprotest attracted a fair amount of\nattention on social media, some of\nthe protesters were under no illusion\nabout the effect that this would have\non the Chinese government, noting\nthat they were likely to play it down\nor perhaps pretend that it had never\nhappened.\nThere appeared to be no shortage\nof people at the protest who were\nnot ethnically Chinese, suggesting\nthat the reach of the \u2018Umbrella\nMovement\u2019 as it has come to be called\nis growing.\nIt will be interesting to see how the\nsituation in Hong Kong develops.\nThe annual extravoganza of Freshers\u2019Fair took over the\nentirity of the South Kensington campus last Tuesday,\nand,despite weather forcasts warning otherwise,\nremained dry for most of the day.\nOver 330 clubs are thought to have taken part in the\nday,alongside the Queen\u2019s Tower Room playing host\nto a number of external stalls,and it is thought that\nover 2 billion email addresses were taken down from\novereager freshers hoping to try everything new in\na bid to get involved\u2013this may be a lie.Only 22% of\nthese were estimated to be hotmail addresses and of\nthese,only 4% of these were thought to be misspelt or\ncontaining multiple underscores or the number\u201c69.\u201d\n(again this may be a lie).\nThe day,organised by Deputy President (Clubs and\nSocieties) Abi de Bruin went very smoothly.The only\nhitch was for the RCSU who had their mascot,Theta,\nstolen by a group from the CGCU lead by Sam Oxley\nand Pari Singh.James Badman,the sole defender of\nthe 60kg of aluminium themometer at the time of\nits theft,was seen sporting a sling but still managed\nto put on a brave face whilst giving out thousands of\npounds worth of freebies afterwards.\nTheta has now been returned to the RCSU after they\npaid the ransom demands.\nPHILIPPA SKETT\nFreshers\u2019 Fair takes\nover campus\nStudents being proactive for the one day of the year they are obliged to do so.

The article, \u201cLifeboat\ncrews warn Thames revellers over\nsafety after student passes out on\nfreshers' week pirate party boat,\u201d was\npublished the following day.\nIt is uncertain as to why the\nstory was picked up by the Evening\nStandard, although it is thought\nto have come to the attention of\njournalists via the Twitter account of\na coastguard.\nThe President, alongside other\nUnion representatives and members\nof staff, were contacted via a vague\nemail from the Standard the\nfollowing day.\nThe email wanted to speak to\nsomeone about \u201cthe welfare of\nstudents at a freshers\u2019 event.\u201d The\nsubject of the email was simply\n\u201c Story\u201d and no-one from the Medic\u2019s\nUnion representatives responded.\nThe boat party, held last Monday\nevening on the Thames in central\nLondon, was organised by the\nentertainment team within Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine Student\u2019s\nUnion (ICSMSU). Around 375 people\nwere on the boat at the time.\nThe Evening Standard reported that\nthe student in question was found\n\"almost unconscious\" and only \"mildly\nresponsive to pain.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Dariush\nHassanzadeh-Baboli, ICSMSU\npresident, and Jennifer Watson, the\nICSMSU Welfare Officer. Both were\npresent on the boat on the night of\nthe incident.\nThey told us that it was quite late\ninto the night when the student\nstarted experiencing difficulties, and\nwas throwing up over the side of the\nboat.\nDespite the best efforts of the\nICSMSU team, the boat staff\nintervened. \u201cThe boat staff came\nover and ask what is going on, and\nwe wanted to put [the student] in\nthe recovery position\u2026 but the boat\npeople basically said no. They asked\nthe student to sit on a chair inside\ninstead.\u201d\nUpon the Captain deciding to\nreturn the boat to shore prematurely,\nstaff called ahead to order an\nambulance. However, Watson\nthought this was unnecessary, and\ntold us that the article exaggerated\nwhat followed. \u201cThe Evening Standard\nsaid she was taken in as priority, but\nthe ambulance was [at the dock] for a\nreally long time. They just kept an eye\non her pulse and her stats.\u201d\n\u201cThe ambulance didn\u2019t move for a\ngood twenty minutes, and we took an\nalmost leisurely drive to the hospital.\nThey didn\u2019t use sirens or anything. It\nwas easily a good 45 minutes or more\nbetween getting off the boat and being\nput into a bed in hospital.\u201d\nWatson continued, \u201cShe had little\nexperience drinking and hadn\u2019t\nactually drunk that much at all. She\njust hadn\u2019t known her limits. The next\nmorning she felt a bit rough, she had a\nbit of a headache and was fine.\u201d\nSo what did they think of the\ncoverage?\nDariush said, \u201cA lot of publications\nlike student bashing as they have\nnothing else to write. I also find it\nreally odd that the police are tweeting\nstuff like this.\u201d\nWatson added, \u201cThat article did\nnothing but bash students, they did\nnothing to mention the [Medics\u2019] SU\u2019s\nefforts.\u201d Dariush continued, \u201cOn the\nwhole, the Faculty of Medicine were\nhappy with the way we dealt with it.\nWe didn\u2019t offer any free drink tokens.\nEssentially it is the licence holder that\nis responsible.\u201d\nWith alcohol banned from being\nbrought onto the boat from outside,\nDariush stressed that \u201cIt is very\npossible what she drank came from\nthe boat\u2019s bar. At the end of the day,\nwhen a dangerous substance is legal,\nand is unregulated, we can\u2019t control\nwhat people do.\u201d\nThe story, reminiscent of the 2011\ncoverage by the Daily Mail of a (then)\ntypical Sport\u2019s night at Reynolds bar\nwhich attracted a lot of attention, and\ntriggered a debate over the behaviour\nof students, drinking during the\nbeginning of term and also the\nbehaviour of Medical Students in\ngeneral.\nThe 2011 coverage resulted in the\nbanning of use of jugs to serve alcohol\nin the bar, alongside the removal of\norange buckets usually placed around\nthe venue in case a student should\nbecome unwell.\nUnruly behaviour on boat parties\nis not uncommon either; one boat\nparty organised by the Royal College\nScience Union (RCSU) back in 2012\nwas terminated early as a table was\nthrown into the river. The boat\nalso had to return back to the shore\naround half an hour after it initially\ndeparted to put an inebriated student\nback on shore. As far as Felix is aware,\nthis story did not hit the national\nheadlines.\nRegardless as to why this particular\nstory has been published, the fact that\nit is in the media could exasperate the\nrepercussions of the incident.\nDariush refused to comment\non whether or not the Faculty\nof Medicine is responding to the\nincident, although they confirm that\nif the story hadn\u2019t got into the press,\nno-one would have found out about\nwhat had happened. Said Watson, \u201cIn\nmy head, it is not a big deal. As a one\noff, you can\u2019t rule out her drink was\nspiked. Most Medic Freshers\u2019 will get\ninto that state in their first year.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is a Fitness to\nPractice issue, as getting drunk and\npassing out once is not uncommon.\u201d\n\u201cThe only reason she went to\nhospital was because the boat staff\ncalled the ambulance. She would have\nbeen just as fine if she had taken a cab\nback to halls.\u201d\nThe Faculty of Medicine doesn\u2019t\nknow the identity of the student\ninvolved, and Watson said that she\nwouldn\u2019t be telling them anyway. \u201cI\u2019m\nbound by confidentiality.\u201d\nDeputy President (Welfare)\nChristopher Kaye spoke to Felix and\nstated his displeasure in such a \u201cnonstory\u201d hitting the headlines. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t\nhighlight any underlying problems.\nThe situation was handled in an\nexemplary manner, such that the\nwelfare of the student was protected.\u201d\n\u201cThe only lapse in judgement came\nfrom the Evening Standard reporting\non the matter.\u201d\n\u201cThe student shouldn\u2019t beat him/\nherself up too much. We\u2019ve all been in\na similar situation at some point, but\nwe\u2019re not all unfortunate enough to\nend up on a boat when it happens.\u201d\nWill there be a boat party in the\nfuture? Dariush finished, \u201cI don\u2019t see\nwhy not. We will review Freshers\u2019\nFortnight, which we do anyway,\nand will always put the relevant\nprecautions in place to make sure our\nstudents are kept safe.\u201d\n\n"

It wasn\u2019t something I came to\nuniversity to do\u2026 But being largely\ninvolved in clubs, it was definitely\nsomething that I started wanting to\ndo towards the end of first year.\nB: Did you consider Deputy of\nClubs and Societies to help clubs\nrun smoothly?\nA: Yeah, I just really enjoyed having\nsupport from the Union, and I\nwanted to be a part of that.\nB: Is there anything you want to\nchange?\nA: I want to try and make\neverything run as smoothly as\npossible, to make sure everything is\nworking. To make sure people who\nare running a society for the first\ntime know what they are doing.\nThe other thing is to look at the\nmanagement group structure and\nsee how we can make that work\npotentially a bit better. It clearly does\nwork, but it can maybe be improved.\nB: On the issue of accountability,\nChris mentioned having a student\nvote to decide if each Sabb has\ndone a good enough job. Do you\nthink with the work of Deputy\nClubs and Societies, the work\nyou do is directly visible to the\nstudents, ie: if all societies run\nsmoothly throughout the year,\nstudents can take that as evidence\nthat you've done a good job?\nA: My job day-to-day involves\nreplying to a lot of requests by all the\ndifferent clubs; management-type\nstuff.\nHow I handle that is very obvious\nto the clubs directly. Hopefully lots of\npeople will see me do a good job this\nyear, but the people who don\u2019t see the\ndirect impact may be the ones who\nactually vote \u2013 because people who\nare unhappy tend to want to voice\ntheir concerns, as opposed to satisfied\npeople not bothering to vote.\nB: Are you involved in deciding\nhow much funding each club gets?\nA: Yes.\nB: Do you think open office\nsessions are needed? Do people\nhave valuable opinions about the\nrunning of clubs?\nA: Yeah. I think students\u2019 opinions\nshould be taken into account. I\u2019m\nnot sure about hot desk-type sessions\nthough, because last year\u2019s were not\nwell-attended, I think.\nB: I think they were badly\npublicised though! Anyway, do you\nhave any comments about your\npredecessor?\nA: Yas was amazing, she also gave a\nfantastic handover.\nB: It's interesting that you're\ndoing a sabb year in the middle of\nyour degree. Do you think the fact\nthat you'll have to go back to being\na student after this year will affect\nwhat you do this year?\nA: Yeah, I think it serves as\nmotivation to do a good job, because\nI want to continue to be heavily\ninvolved in clubs when I return. If\nI change something, it will directly\naffect me!\nB: Can you run me through your\nday to day tasks?\nA: I tend to get in and spend a\ncouple of hours replying to emails.\nThen I\u2019ll have a meeting with a club;\neither an event budget or a room\nbooking. There\u2019s always something, I\ngenerally have a couple of meetings\nwith different clubs every day!\nProbably a meeting with someone\nat the Union; a catch-up or planning\nand executing a task. Most days there\nis also a meeting with College, eg:\nabout power outlets on Queen\u2019s Lawn,\nor clubs Open Days.\nB: Are you consulted about the\nsports grounds Imperial owns?\nA: Commercially-sensitive\nthings are generally just decided by\nCollege and dealt with by the Union\nPresident, due to the high level of\nconfidentiality. But in terms of how\nclubs go to the sports grounds and\nhow they use them, that\u2019s part of the\nsports partnership the Union has with\nCollege. I do have some involvement\nin it, but not a great deal.\nB: What do you think about\nCollege closing Teddington sports\ngrounds?\nA: There were a weird couple of\nmonths where we didn\u2019t really know\nwhat was going on, but College then\nclarified things for us. I don\u2019t know\nmuch about the loss of Teddington\ngrounds, but it is to the benefit of\ngaining Heston, which is fantastic.\nB: Is Heston further away?\nA: Yes, it is further, and it is less\naccessible by public transport, which\nis a bit of an issue. But having it\nnext to Harlington, it\u2019s much easier\nto have two grounds next to each\nother. The benefits of Heston though\nis that not only does it have sports\nfields, it has indoor space, including a\ntheatre. So hopefully we can get more\ninvolvement from Heston than just\nuse of it as sports grounds.\nB: Things like this makes it seem\nlike the Union has little impact on\nthe decision that is reached.\nA: Yeah. These places are owned\nby College, so we can only inform\nCollege about the impact it will have\non students.\nB: But even then, College don't\nhave to listen?\nA: (awkward silence)\nB: So your job is to represent the\nstudent view, but in the end what\nthey do with that is up to them?\nA: Yeah, basically\u2026\nB: I'm only asking to clarify,\nbecause there are loads of students\nwho are really angry with the\nUnion for not doing a good enough\njob with regards to doing what the\nstudents want. But in reality, it\nisn't the Union's fault!\nA: Yeah, there are many meetings\nand decisions which are made\nsolely by College, and they don\u2019t\ncommunicate anything to the Union,\nso it\u2019s really hard to organise a\nrebuttal.\nSo with Teddington, now we know\nfor sure that the medics can\u2019t have\nit any more, we can only try and do\neverything we can to make sure that\nthey are properly represented at\nHeston.\nB: What about the people you\nwork with in the office? The non-sabb full time workers?\nA: I\u2019ve got the 3 student activities\nworkers (manager, administrator,\ncoordinator) and someone who\nsupports the sports partnership.\nB: Who hires them?\nA: The Union hires them; I sat on\nthe panel for some of them. There is\ninput from the sabbs about who gets\nhired.\nB: So do they work under you?\nA: -Ish. Technically the sabbs are in\ncontrol of the way the Union is run in\ncertain respects. But their day to day\njobs are not determined by us. They\nreport to the Managing Director, who\nis below Tom.\nWe\u2019re not exactly in charge of\nthem, but they do answer to us. We\ndetermine the direction we want the\nUnion to go.\nB: Okay. But in the end, what the\nUnion does this year IS decided by\nthe sabbatical team?\nA: We give an idea of the aims and\ngoals we want to achieve. But in the\nend, there are things which have to\nbe run every year, like the finances of\nthe Union.\nBut we can propose the changes we\nwant to make.\n\"I think\nstudents'\nopinions\nshould\nbe taken\ninto\naccount.\"\n\"I want\nto try\nand make\neverything\nrun as\nsmoothly\nas possible,\nto make\nsure\neverything\nis working.\"\nB: What's the thing you most like\nor dislike about the Union?\nA: I like the atmosphere. The fact\nthat we\u2019re students but we can help in\nthe running of the Union. In terms\nof dislike: not having enough time.\nI get so many requests that need\nanswering, but I have meetings and\nso much other stuff.\nB: In terms of Press, does College\ninfluence the Union? Or is there a\nclear separation between the Union\nand the College?\nA: The Union has its own\nCommunications department. They\nmake sure that everything we say is\nrepresentative of the Union and what\nthe students think. College Comms\nruns separately and they often get\none of our representatives to give a\nstatement.\nB: Alright, you can have some\nfun questions. If you were trapped\non a desert island with the other\nSabbs, who do you think you would\ncollectively eat first? Or: who do\nyou think would be the last person\nto survive?\nA: Tom would definitely outlive us\nall. He\u2019s got outdoor survival skills.\nI\u2019m not sure who we would eat first. It\nwould depend on how useful people\nprove themselves to be.\nB: Did you go out a lot in your\nfreshers year? Can you recommend\nany places or any to avoid?\nA: I did go out a fair bit in my first\nyear, but I was also in a lot of clubs, so\nI didn\u2019t have that much time. I would\nnot advice going to Propaganda\ntoo much: as much as you think it\u2019s\namazing in first year, it is never\nthat good. I haven\u2019t been out for\nquite a while, but I quite like Roxy\u2019s\nand some places in Vauxhall too. In\nterms of pubs, you can\u2019t beat a good\n\u2018Spoons,\u2019 B@1 or a decent cocktail bar.\nB: If you had to eat one meal\nfrom 568 for the rest of your life,\nwhat would it be?\nA: The halloumi salad is pretty\ngood. And you wouldn\u2019t be\ndisgustingly unhealthy.\nB: If you were allowed to name\na Union drinking bar, what would\nyou name it?\nA: I feel I would be letting the\nstudent body down if we didn\u2019t name\nit a science pun... But I can\u2019t think of\none right now!\nPhoto: Thomas Lim\n\n"

    "content": "2 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.10.2014\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park & Jack Steadman\nMoney can\u2019t buy happiness\nJohn Park tells all about Maps to the Stars\nOne can only hope that the\nHollywood we see in David\nCronenberg\u2019s Maps to the\nStars is not an accurate depiction of\nthe film industry in any way. We\nhear stories of abuse, but mostly\nHollywood is a place that likes to keep\nup its appearances. But writer Bruce\nWagner is not exactly in the mood\nfor holding back. What is portrayed\nin Maps to the Stars is bizarre and\ndownright horrendous. The level of\ndesperation characters sink into for\nwhat they want is an uncomfortable\nsight, and when it is portrayed in such\na graphic, straightforward fashion,\nthe events here become all the more\nshocking for the audience.\nTo describe fading star Havanna\nSegrand (Julianne Moore) as unstable\nwould be a big understatement. Doing\nwhatever she can to salvage what\nseemingly little she has left of her\nmovie career, this ageing actress is\neager to play the same role her late\nmother starred in. But it never helps\nwhen you are not the director\u2019s first\nchoice for the lead role. This, coupled\nwith Havanna\u2019s hallucinatory,\nnightmarish haunting from the ghost\nof her mother (Sarah Gadon) makes\nmatters worse.\nNot being good enough, young\nenough, to survive in the tough\nindustry are the paranoid thoughts\nthat plague her mind, and in her\nCannes Best Actress-winning\nperformance, Moore brings out the\ntragically fragile, vulnerable, insecure\ndesperation out of Havanna, as she\nblunders through life and career.\nHavanna goes on to hire a \u2018chore\nwhore\u2019 a charming term used to\ndescribe her personal assistant,\nAgatha (Mia Wasikowska). It becomes\nquickly clear that Agatha, the quiet,\nobedient young woman is not quite as\ninnocent as she seems. Like everyone\nin this town, Agatha has her own goal\nto achieve, which forms a part of a\nstoryline that turns more shocking\nwith every little reveal.\nWho else is involved in this dark,\ntwisted tale? Havanna\u2019s therapist,\nof course, Dr Stafford Weiss (John\nCusack), who uses some rather odd,\nunconventional methods to help the\nactress work through her problems.\nHavanna cites childhood abuse as a\nroot of her problems, an accusation\nher ghost mother vehemently denies\nin one of her freak entrances. The\nWeiss family shows us the definition\nof a reality show freak family gone\nhorribly wrong. They may not have\ncameras following them around\nrecording their daily activities, but\nthey might as well have a show of\ntheir own, because the skeleton in\ntheir closet is too juicy not to be\nrattled out.\nStafford\u2019s son Benjie (Evan Bird)\nis a teen star sensation who has been\nin and out of rehab for substance\nabuse, his mother Cristina (Olivia\nWilliams) acts as his manager, taking\nambitious control of her young\nbrat\u2019s money-making career. This is\na family formed on egos and dreams,\nwhich can be healthy in certain\ncircumstances, but not when there\nis an unspeakble secret looming that\nwill threaten to destroy everything\nthey have built to preserve.\nCronenberg\u2019s newest film is a\ncollection of nightmares characters\nendure. Everyone has something\ntroubling that truly takes over their\npsychological well-being, and when\ntheir world comes crashing down\nin one way or another, the struggle\nto hold on to anything normal is\nclearly easier said than done. The\nbaggage each character is burdened\nwith is substantial, and it is a wonder\nthat they have all made it this far in\ntheir lives. Setting up the problems,\nessentially what covers the film\u2019s first\nhalf or so, is where the film excels.\nThere is plenty of excellent build-up,\nutilising unique characters portrayed\nby actors skilled enough to play them.\nBut it is towards the film\u2019s final\nact the plot begins to lose its grip.\nIt becomes so focused on shocking\nthe audience with gasp-worthy\nreveals that it stops being about\nthe characters. The Weiss family,\nHavanna, and Agatha are all heavily\naffected by their personal crises, but\nwhat we see is only the immediate\nresult, never the long-term\nconsequences. The film leaves all too\nmuch hanging in the air, with very\nlittle explanation to wrap up each\nstoryline.\nThe handling of Havanna\u2019s plot\nstrand is a cop-out, and how Agatha\nand the Weiss family end can hardly\nbe described as satisfactory. This is a\nshame, because the finale never quite\ndoes the cast justice.\nWhat starts off promisingly as\na dark, wickedly funny satire into\nthe lives of Hollywood stars quickly\nturns into a game of which plot\ndevelopment can have the most\ngasping impact, and through that it\nloses its way. But the performances\nare uniformly spectacular, which\ndoes make it all the more bearable to\nhold on until the madness comes to\nan end.\n\"Not being\ngood\nenough,\nyoung\nenough, to\nsurvive in\nthe tough\nindustry\nare the\nparanoid\nthoughts\nthat plague\nher mind.\"\nDirector: David Cronenberg\nScreenplay: Bruce Wagner\nCast: Julianne Moore, Mia\nWasikowska, John Cusack,\nRobert Pattinson\nGone, baby, gone\nJack Steadman tries not to wince at Gone Girl\nRight out of the starting blocks,\nGone Girl screams that it was\nmade by David Fincher. The\n20th Century Fox logo plays out\nwithout its usual fanfare (an echo of\nits corruption at the opening of Alien\n3), before the film lays out its trump\ncards very clear: this is not what you\nwere expecting (unless you\u2019ve read the\nbook).\nEerie shots of an empty town\nat daybreak, a voice-over from\nBen Affleck\u2019s Nick that almost\nimmediately starts discussing\ncracking open his wife Amy\n(Rosamund Pike)\u2019s head to get at the\nsecrets inside, and a perfectly pitched\nscore from Trent Reznor and Atticus\nRoss \u2013 it all builds to make an opening\nthat leaves you feeling grimy, dirty,\neven before it all starts going wrong.\nThen, when it all starts going\nwrong, the film refuses to let you\nsettle. This is no straight-forward\ntale of abduction \u2013 it\u2019s something\nfar more complex. Flashbacks so\ncute you want to punch them in\nthe face (to paraphrase a line from\nAmy on her relationship with Nick\nin its early stages) riddle the gloom,\npunctuating the relentless drive of\nthe investigation with a look at the\ncircumstances preceding it, a breath\nof happiness and joy amidst all the\nhorror.\nPowered by Amy\u2019s narration, the\nflashbacks give the film context,\nallowing you to care about a character\nwe barely see in the modern storyline\n\u2013 and then using that to hurt you.\nThe flashbacks take a turn for the\nugly, the darkness infects the light of\nthose early, special moments, and all\nis not as it seems. Twists hide behind\nevery dark corner, and just as it all\nthreatens to build to a climax, to spill\nover into the truth: the film pulls\nthe rug from under you. And it is\nmasterful.\nFincher really gives his actors space\nto breathe in a film that is otherwise\nclinically precise as it relays the story\nin a Crime Scene Investigation style.\nHe does this by forcing his actors\nto undergo mulitple hundreds of\ntakes and has previously said that if\nyou spend millions on building sets,\nhiring cameras, and buying rights to a\nstory, you might as well spend a long\ntime with your actors getting each\ntake totally perfect.\nThis has really paid off as each\ncast member is able to show their\ncharacter\u2019s flaws whilst remaining\ntotally believable.\nThe film\u2019s twisty-turny plot\nis sold by the cast \u2013 Ben Affleck\ncontinues his trend of excellent\nmovies, managing to make the\nmostly unlikeable Nick weirdly\nsympathetic (and also either relatable\nor understandable, with each word\nbecoming more relevant at various\npoints throughout the film). As the\neponymous girl, Rosamund Pike\nfinally makes her (ridiculously)\nbelated step up to leading lady, and\nit\u2019s nothing short of magnificent.\nDespite being \u2013 obviously \u2013 \u2018gone\u2019\nfor much of the film, she still makes\nan undeniable impact, selling the\nfilm even when it sometimes verges\non the ridiculous. The supporting\ncast make an impact here, too \u2013\nnotably Neil Patrick Harris, in what\nis possibly the most against-type\nrole possible as Amy\u2019s stalker-ish,\nobsessive ex-boyfriend. In part, it\u2019s\nthis willingness on Fincher\u2019s part to\ntoy with our expectations \u2013 and to go\non to subvert them so maliciously,\nthat really helps push the film past\nthe occasional leaps of faith it is\nforced to demand in the name of\npushing the story forward.\nDespite said leaps, Gillian Flynn\u2019s\nadaptation of her own novel is mostly\nan exercise in adaptation done right,\nas she takes to the opportunity to\nnip and tuck here and there, finding\nways to ensure the book\u2019s style seeps\nthrough, while also seizing the chance\nto alter the ending from the original.\nHaving failed to read the book,\nI can\u2019t confirm just how different\nit is \u2013 but it works, regardless. The\ntension refuses to let up \u2013 mostly in\npart due to the fact that every time\na new answer is given, it creates a\nspider\u2019s web of questions that \u2013 when\ncombined with Fincher\u2019s directorial\nflair \u2013 draw you further into the\nseething cauldron of lies and deceit\nthat sit at the heart of Gone Girl.\nIt\u2019s that combination that elevates\nGone Girl to become something\nmore \u2013 the script is strong, but it isn\u2019t\nperfect, so what truly pushes the film\nup is how it comes alive in Fincher\u2019s\nhands. It always felt like the perfect\nfilm for the man, but there\u2019s no sense\nof him just being on auto-pilot here.\nIt\u2019s the complete opposite \u2013 there\u2019s\na sense of Fincher having the time\nof his life, gleefully using the tale to\ntake potshots at several targets. The\nmedia are among those hit hardest \u2013\nthe film is an evisceration of almost\neverything they are and do \u2013 but\nin the end, it\u2019s marriage that truly\nsuffers. Gone Girl is the antithesis of\na date movie. Which is pretty much\nwhy everyone should see it.\n\"Flashbacks\nso cute\nyou want\nto punch\nthem in\nthe face\nriddle the\ngloom.\"\nDirector: David Fincher\nScreenplay: Gillian Flynn\nCast: Ben Affleck, Rosamund\nPike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler\nPerry, Carrie Coon\n\n"

To work the trend for dinner or\non a night out, wear this black halterneck number also by Missguided. Pair it\nwith red lipstick, simple black heels and a single statement bracelet or bangle\nto complete the evening look.\nOversize Coats\nActually, oversize everything.\nThis season, oversize coats are a big trend everywhere. Spotted on the Prada,\nChanel and Schumacher runways, this style is easy to pull off and effortlessly\nchic. This kind of coat can be worn everyday with casual wear and even on a\ncold night out. Pair it with skinny jeans on a cold day or wear it with a mini\nskirt on the milder autumn days. By night, wear it with your favourite heels\nand a dress for a polished evening look. Try this ecru version by mango, its\nmuted colour will make it easy to co-ordinate with any outfit.\nWhite dress and Black dress, both from Missguided.com, \u00a324.99\nGold Rush\nGold featured heavily on the Autumn/Winter designer runways, and the\ntrend is a great way to brighten up a chilly autumn day. It\u2019s easy to incorporate\nin your wardrobe, and if gold garbs aren\u2019t your thing, then you can rock the\ntrend with gold accessories, like this gold bangle by Tory Burch. If you want\nto incorporate the look in your wardrobe in a not-so-flashy way, try out\nthis golden sweater by Zara. Its subtle golden finish will brighten up your\nwardrobe.\nAnoraks\nThankfully, this season\u2019s trends have\nreflected an appetite for practical\nfashion. A stylish wool coat is all\nwell and good, but with the Autumn\nshowers in full swing, an anorak is the\nperfect transitional piece. Light and\nbreathable for mild days whilst still\nprotecting you from pesky autumn\nshowers.\nThe anorak has been seen on\nthe runways for MiuMiu, Stella\nMcCartney and Christopher Kane,\njust to name just a few. The trend\nshows that high end fashion is\nchanging, becoming less formalised\nthan it has been in the past. Fashion is\nno longer embarrassed by function!\nFor a sporty chic vibe, pair an\nanorak with a dress on milder days.\nOn those gray, wet days, wear it with\nyour favourite jeans and wellies\nand you\u2019ll be kitted out to brave\nthe elements! Uniqlo offers a great\nrange of anoraks for just \u00a324.90 in\na rainbow of different colours. At\nthat price, you can\u2019t go wrong, and\nyou may as well pick up one or two in\ndifferent shades.\nExtreme Turtlenecks\nHow do you make a boring knit\nsweater just a little more interesting?\nYou add a turtleneck of course! This\ntrend, popular in the 1960\u2019s, has been\nmaking a strong comeback recently.\nThankfully, much like the anorak\ntrend, this speaks to a paradigm shift\nin the fashion industry. Elements of\npractical fashion have been embraced\nlike never before this season. Armed\nwith knitted turtlenecks and oversize\ncoats this winter, you\u2019ll be nice and\ntoasty and ready to brace the cold.\nTo tone down the dramatic look, pair\na turtleneck with a thick scarf and\nminimal accessorising.\nLeft: Schumacher coat fall/winter 2014. Right: Mohair blend coat, Mango,\n\u00a344.99 River Island turtleneck, \u00a330.00\nUniqlo parka, \u00a324.90\nAbove: Tory Burch bangle, \u00a385.00.\nRight, Zara sweater, \u00a325.99\n\"oversize\ncoats are...\neasy to pull\noff and\neffortlessly\nchic.\"\n27 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n06.10.2014\n\n"

Entering the\n1540 room, marking the beginning\nof British fine art, four pairs of\neyes glare out at you from a single\npanel. An oil painting on wood, The\nCholmondeley Ladies depicts two\nwomen, dressed in bleached-white\nfinery, and resembling pieces of\nbone china, who each carry an infant\nswaddled in a blood red christening\ngown.\nAn inscription in gold provides\nsome context, telling us they these\ntwo women \u2018were born the same day,\nMarried the same day, and brought to\nBed the same day\u2019.\nIt is a Daily Mail story, captured in\noils; a Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not for\nthe 1600s.\nI don\u2019t know why I love the painting\nso much. Perhaps it is formal\nrigidity of the painting style. These\ntwo ghostly apparitions and their\ncrimson bounties are starkly flat.\nNo attempt at depth has been made,\nwhich, as well as giving the painting\nan otherworldly feel, confers a sense\nof modernism about it. Painted some\nthree centuries before Picasso\u2019s Les\nDemoiselles d\u2019Avignon, it seems to\npredict the radical geometry that\nwould become so popular during the\n20th Century.\nThere is a beautiful symmetry\nabout the painting too, as if painted\nby a forerunner of Wes Anderson,\nwhich would suggest that the two\nwomen were twins, and yet there are\nsubtle differences between the two:\ntheir clothing differs, and their eye\ncolours don\u2019t match - clearly they are\nnot identical twins.\nAnd perhaps this is why I like it.\nThe air of mystery that envelops\nthe painting so tightly has a great\nattraction to me. We have no idea\nwho these ladies were, and no other\nhistorical record exists of them. The\nrigid poses of the women, who cradle\ntheir babies indifferently, is not\nfound in any other work of the same\nperiod, apart from tomb sculpture,\nso perhaps this is a tribute to women\nwho have died?\nThe painter is unknown, lost to\nthe annals of history, and the person\nwho donated it in 1955 remained\nanonymous.

Even on weekends it is\nvirtually empty, so you can sit back\nand enjoy the craftsmanship without\nthe hassle you get with the better\nknown art establishments. Huge\nglass cabinets filled to the brim with\nceramics extend the whole length of\nhallways, ensuring totally immersive\nexperience. It is little wonder then\nthat one can spend hours utterly\ntransfixed!\nAs you follow the collection\nTeapot and Jug, Lucie Rie and Bowl, Lucie Rie.

One artist in\nparticular, Ryoji Koie, is a favourite of\nmine in the way he gives the clay such\na fluid and dynamic feel that makes\nyou doubt whether the clay has been\nfired at all!\nThe argument is often made of the\nV&A that it can feel a bit stale, more a\ncatalogue of artifacts than something\nthrilling.

I don't understand\nit. He killed two people. It was two\ncounts of manslaughter but he will\nout in no time unless somebody\nblocks his parole. He will come out\nand kill somebody else.\u201d\n\u201cThey thought he would have gone\non to win a Nobel Prize. The fact he\nhad been awarded a Royal Society\nfellowship allowed him to do what he\nwanted to do. He had a brilliant mind\nand he was a special person.\u201d\nFogarty, was noted to not posses a\nWestern Australian driving license,\nand has a history of drug addiction.\nThe car he was driving was stolen,\nand he had previously jumped two\nred lights before hitting the taxi Dr.\nBarrett was riding in.\nMr. Fogarty was jailed in 2013\nfor 11 years, pleading guilty to two\ncounts of manslaughter. A second\nman, Kuldeep Singh, was also killed\nhaving shared the cab journey to the\ncity centre from the airport with Dr.\nBarrett.\nDr. Barrett was a distinguished\nacademic at Imperial, having been\nawarded a Royal Society Fellowship.\nHis research was in the fields of\nquantum physics and quantum\ncomputing, and he also taught a\npopular postgraduate course in the\nCentre for Controlled Quantum\nDynamics.\n\u201cOver his career Sean demonstrated\nan extraordinary versatility in\nunderstanding deeply the physics\nof very different physical systems\nincluding quantum dots, cavity\nquantum electrodynamics, trapped\natoms and ions, superconducting\nqubits and nonlinear optics.\u201d Said\ncolleagues Professor Myungshik Kim\nand Dr Terry Rudolph in 2012.\n\u201cWorking with Sean was a joy. He\norganised Wednesday breakfast\nmeetings for the Controlled Quantum\nDynamics Group for two years, and\nhis hugely charismatic personality\nwas a crucial part of their success.\n\u201cSean cared deeply about the careers\nof his graduate students and those\nhe taught. He was an energetic,\nextremely clear and pedagogical\nlecturer, and we have heard many\nstories from people he greatly\ninspired.\u201d\n\u201cWe will miss Sean\u2019s humour, his\nreliability, his basic \u2018mateship\u2019 and\nhis fundamental decency as a human\nbeing.\u201d\nInquest into death of Imperial\nacademic comes to a close\nPHILIP KENT\nDEPUTY EDITOR\n...Continued from front page\nWhile separate, the remit of both\nreports is largely complementary,\nthough there is overlap in the\nrecommendations made with regards\nto general management and strategic\nwork at Imperial.\nIn a statement released by College\nconcerning the news, Provost and\nEstablishment Licence holder\nProfessor James Stirling said: \u201cWe\nwelcome the publication of the report\nabout this extensive Home Office\ninvestigation, which shows that the\nvast majority of the allegations made\nagainst Imperial by BUAV have not\nbeen substantiated.\n\u201cWe are pleased that the\ninvestigation recognises the quality\nof care provided by our staff and the\nwork of our researchers in refining\nprocedures where possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe recognise that there have\nbeen problems with the culture and\nmanagement around our animal\nresearch.\u201d\n\u201cWe are sorry for these\nshortcomings and we have addressed\nthem through considerable efforts\nand investment in our animal\nresearch infrastructure, to improve\nour culture of care and to ensure that\nwe meet the very highest standards in\nour animal research.\u201d\nReynolds appoints first full-time manager\nReynolds bar,described by the\nUnion as\u201cthe heart of the Imperial\nCollege School of Medicine\u201d,has\nhired a new full time bar manager.\nCarl Salton-Cox,the new manager,\nwas hired following an advert\non the Union website for a new\nReynolds manager at the beginning\nof the Summer break.Having\npreviously worked as a student\nbar manager,operations officer\nand assistant venue manager at\nthe University of Sussex Students\u2019\nUnion,it is hoped that he has the\nexperience to see both sides of\nsituations and improve profitability\nin keeping with what the Medics\nand other students want.\nThe Union declined to arrange an\ninterveiw with Carl for Felix,instead\nthey offered an interview with Alex\nSavell,Deputy President (Finance &\nServices).\nOn interviewing,Alex Savell\nexplained that the idea is to make\nReynolds a sustainable bar is still\nhere in 20-30 years.\nReferencing the recent incident\ninvolving an ICSM boat party,Alex\nacknowledged the need for change.\n\u201cI certainly hope that the nature\nof the media coverage we get is\ngoing to change.I think there\u2019s\ngonna[sic] have to be,slowly over\ntime,a change to make sure we don\u2019t\nget that kind of media coverage,\nand that we are doing our duty to\nprotect\u2026our students,particularly\nour younger students.\u201d\n\u201cChanges made at Reynolds will\nnot be instant,and will take place\nin conjunction with ICSM Exec\nand the existing bar staff.The new\nmanagement is there to ensure that\nwe keep access to Reynolds and the\nuse of the space.\u201d\nIn terms of the changes to be\nmade,the Union is keen to make\nsure that the Medics retain a stake in\nthe bar,and that it should not stop\nbeing a loud and fun environment\nto be in.It was also noted that the\nmore the bar makes,and the more\nstudents to whom the bar caters,the\nmore likely it is that the space will\nremain open.\nReynolds came under fire from\nthe Daily Mail in 2011,and was\nlikened to\u201ca hostel for down-and-out alcoholics\u201d. The bar has a\nreputation for raucous,uncontrolled\nnights amongst students as well,\nwith\u201crank\u201dbeing one of the kinder\ndescriptions used.\nMore widely across the Union,\nReynolds Bar fits into the spectrum\nof Union-run bars with its own\nbranding and a character that is not\nvisibly associated with anything else\nat the Union.The building of this\nbrand,without losing the sense of\nownership felt by the medics,puts\nit alongside h-bar,which caters\nexclusively to postgraduates and\nstaff.\nThe Union are currently hiring\ncasual duty managers for all three\nUnion venues to support the\npermanent staff,with applications\nwelcome from students and non-students alike.\nReynolds is open from 18:00 to\n23:00 every weekday,and opens late\non Wednesdays and Fridays\u2013the\nfirst sports night of the year will\ntake place this coming Wednesday.\nCarl was also unavailable to\ncomment on the management of\nthe vomit usually associated with\nthese events,but we here at Felix\nwould like to wish him the best of\nluck with the new position.\nBEN HOWITT\n\n"

I've just left my girlfriend\n(who's in the year below at school)\nbehind at home, and I'm scared\nthat I won't be able to get the\n'full university experience' if I'm\nconstantly worrying about keeping\nher happy and answering her\nphonecalls ten times a day. What\nshould I do?\nPressured in Pembridge\nFirst of all, don\u2019t be a dick. Don\u2019t cheat\non her, and don\u2019t try and get her to\nbreak up with you. It\u2019s completely\nnormal to feel this way; and if I\u2019m\nhonest, the Christmas break up is way\nmore common than you\u2019d think. You\ndon\u2019t need to sleep your way around\ncampus to have a complete University\nexperience, you can easily have fun\nwithout doing anything that would\nworry your girlfriend. That said,\neveryone inevitably changes a lot\nwhen they start University, and it is\nunderstandable if you feel that you\ndon\u2019t have the same connection by\nthe end of your first term. Honesty\nis always the best policy, and always\nworks out better for both of you in the\nlong term.\nHelp! I'm new to the UK and I want\nto make friends with people from\nall over the world, not just from my\nown country, but I'm worried that\nit'll just be so much easier to stick\nwith people who speak my own\nlanguage. How should I go about it?\nForeign in Falmouth\nYou have an incredible opportunity\nat Imperial. You have thousands of\npeople from all over the world, and\neveryone speaks English at least\nwell enough to make friends. When\nmaking friends from completely\ndifferent cultures, the hard part is\nfinding common ground, but here,\nyou\u2019re all in the same situation.\nEveryone\u2019s studied STEM subjects,\neveryone (in halls and on your course)\nis a fresher, and the vast majority of\npeople are new to London. Use that as\na starting point to bond, and go from\nthere. Making friends is the best part\nof University, and you\u2019ll be surprised\nto find how open people are to doing\nthis.\nHelp! I'm coming from an all-boys\nschool, and I've never really had\nany opportunity to spend any time\nwith, or be friends with girls. I\ndon't know how to talk to them,\nhow can I make friends?\nTerrified in Tizard\nDo you like music? Guess what? There\nare probably girls that like the same\ntype of music. How about films? Yup,\nthere are girls that like them too.\nOr are you a gamer? Gaming isn\u2019t a\ngender specific activity. What I\u2019m\ntrying to say is that you are thinking\ntoo hard about the differences, and\nyou need to think more about what\nthe similarities you have with each\nperson. A girl-you-don\u2019t-know is no\nmore scary than a guy-you-don\u2019tknow. Why not ask what their hobbies\nare? You\u2019re bound to have something\nin common, you just have to find it.\nHelp! I don't have a room in halls,\nso I'm living by myself in a flat\nfurther out, but I'm really worried\nabout not having anyone to go to\nevents with. Am I missing out?\nAlone in Acton Town\nAgony Aunt Annie Whiteley is the woman who fought for women\u2019s cloakroom facilities at Imperial,\nand thus is qualified to solve all your problems.\nEditors Ellen Mathieson & Tessa Davey\nCoffeebreak\ncatnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTHE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 3\n22.09.2014\nFELIX\nHello to all you new freshers! This time of year is hard for everyone. The sudden reality of Summer is over, bringing the\nreality of studying, and the end of the whirlwind of sun soaked hormones. No matter what you\u2019re worrying about, Aunt\nAnnie is here to help. Send any worries to catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Returning students too, you know the drill. Don\u2019t be\nafraid to keep sending in your problems!\nHOW TO SURVIVE FRESHERS\nHelp! At home over the summer,\nI ended up getting back together\nwith my ex-boyfriend, who I broke\nup with when I started Imperial\nlast year. Now term's started, I'm\nlooking forward to getting back\nto my single life in London, but\nhe thinks that we're going to stay\ntogether and keeps making plans\nfor when we're going to see each\nother. How do I break it to him\ngently that it was just a summer\nfling?\nSassy in Sheffield\nTruthfully, if you knew you just\nwanted a summer fling, you should\nhave been honest with him from\nthe start, instead of leading him on.\nWe're all grown ups here, it's okay\nto just want a bit of fun over the\nsummer. But it's too late for that\nnow. When it comes to telling him,\nthe sooner the better, especially\nbefore any plans become finalised.\nYou don't want him to break the\nbank whilst you're breaking his\nheart.\nHelp! I'm just starting my fourth\nyear, but all of my close friends\nhave left, having finished their\nthree year degrees. How do I put\nmyself back in the frame of mind\nto make new friends?\nFriendless in Fulham\nYou're not going to be the only\nperson who suddenly finds\nthemselves with far fewer friends\ngoing into your final year. With\na lot of people gone, courses are\nsmaller, and so there's a lot less\npressure on going up to them and\nsaying hi. If you see someone sitting\nby themselves in lectures, they're\nprobably in the same situation as\nyou, and would welcome a bit of\ncompany. Even if you never become\nas close as your old group, you'll still\nhave people to discuss lectures, lab\nreports and life with.\nHelp! I'm about to move into my\nnew house with some of my best\nfriends from halls, which I'm really\nexcited about, but I'm nervous\nabout moving in with one of my\nfriends, who confessed to having a\ncrush on me over the summer. I'm\nreally not interested, how do I stop\nit being awkward?\nWorried in Warwick\nSo long as you've already made it\nclear that you aren't interested in\nthem then there is no reason to\nworry. Maybe this crush will have\nfaded over the summer or maybe it\nwon't, but either way it's no reason to\nmake everything awkward between\nyou. They are one of your closest\nfriends for a reason, so don't be an\nidiot and deprive yourself of their\ncompany because you're worried\nthey are going try and get in your\npants. Act natural, don't worry about\nthem creeping at you in a towel and\neverything will be fine. A situation is\nonly as awkward as you make it.\nHOW TO COPE WITH COMING BACK TO IMPERIAL\nImperial have events for new students\nwho aren\u2019t living in halls, so make\nsure you get yourself along to them\nto meet other people with the same\nconcerns as you. You also might want\nto make friends with people who do\nlive in halls, and the easiest way to do\nthis is to make the extra effort to talk\nto people on your course, and join\nplenty of societies. Hint: grinding on\nsomeone in a club doesn\u2019t count as\ngetting to know them. It might be a\nbit harder for you to meet people, but\nif you push yourself to talk to people\nwherever you go, you should have\nloads of friends with no trouble at all.\nHelp! I've been given a double\nroom. I've never shared a room\nbefore and I've hit it off badily\nwith my roommate! What should\nI do?\nSocially awkward in Southwell\nRoommates can be really hit and\nmiss, and a lot of it depends on your\nattitude. While a lot of people get on\nfantastically with their roommate,\nit\u2019s quite common to treat it as a\nbusiness arrangement, being civil\nwhile not being BFFs, which can\nsometimes make it easier to say things\nlike: \u201cplease stop leaving your bras\neverywhere\u201d. Sharing a room needn\u2019t\nbe scary, and the main trick is to be\nreally open about problems between\nyou. You both have to live there, so\nyou need to make the best of it. A lot\nof roommates end up having beautiful\nfriendships, and very few end up\nhating each other, so don\u2019t worry too\nmuch, be friendly, and most of all, be\nhonest and don\u2019t be a dick.\nLonely Hearts\nAre you lonely in love? Why not let Aunt Annie help you get lucky? If you\u2019re looking for a\nspecial someone, missed a connection, or want to let someone know how you feel, send a\nmessage to catnip.felix@imperial.ac.uk and maybe you\u2019ll find your match here.\nAnnie\u2019s advice for\nthis week is: Don\u2019t\nBe A Dick. Listen\nto Annie, and you\nwon\u2019t go far wrong.\n\n"

However,\nLSD research plummeted after the\nintroduction of the UK Misuse of\nDrugs Act in 1971, the start of the\ngovernmental campaign for the\noutright ban of drugs in an attempt\nto tackle illegal trade, and arguably\none of the most spectacularly\nmisinformed and failed policies ever\nintroduced given on-going debate\nas to the effectiveness of outright\nprohibition.\nUnder the UK Misuse of Drugs\nAct LSD is a Class A drug, giving\nit a foreboding reputation that\nis more the result of a historical\nmisdemeanour rather than a true\ncalculation of the drug\u2019s relative\nrisks. Now, Carhart-Harris is set\non breaking this 50-year taboo\nsurrounding the use of psychedelics\nin research and is the first person\nin the UK since 1971 to have legally\nadministered (albeit very minute)\ndoses of LSD to 10 human volunteers.\nThis recent study conducted various\nimagery tests on the volunteers\nwhilst tripping on acid to test the\neffect of LSD on suggestibility.\nThe theory goes that acid puts the\nbrain in a more supple state of mind,\nwith room for manipulation and\na higher susceptibility for change.\n\u201cDepression and addictions rest on\nreinforced patterns of brain activity,\nand a psychedelic will introduce\nrelative chaos\u2026 new things can be\nlearnt and at the same time old\nthings can be unlearnt\u201d, explains Dr\nCarhart-Harris.\nThe team of researchers are\nfollowing a more logical and\ncautious methodology compared to\nthe hit-and-miss approach to LSD\nresearch pre-1960s and have had\npromising results which indicate\nthat the influence of suggestion is\nenhanced by LSD, especially amongst\nvolunteers with more conscientious\nand organised personality traits.\nProfessor David Nutt in his book\nDrugs \u2013 Without the Hot Air (a must\nread if you haven\u2019t already) even\nsuggests that more scientists should\ntry psychedelics as a tool for finding\nsolutions to difficult problems by\nlooking at them from a different\nperspective.\nWhich is not as shocking a\nsuggestion as it may first seem\nconsidering that back in the 1950s\nFrancis Crick, along with co-researcher James Watson, were both\nunder the influence of LSD when they\nmade their discovery of the double-helix structure and that led to the\npath of modern genetics. However,\nDr Carhart-Harris also remarks on\nthe dangers with psychedelics when\nNobel Prize Winners 2014\nResearch led by Dr Robin Carhart-Harris reveals LSD's mind-altering powers Photo: Creative Commons\ntaken without the proper caution and\nin an unsafe setting.\nDespite funding setbacks, Dr\nCarhart-Harris continues to carry\nout pioneering research into\nPHYSICS\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics for this\nyear has been jointly awarded to\nIsamu Akasaki,Hiroshi Amano\nand Shuji Nakamura for their\ninvention of the blue light emitting\ndiode (LED),which can generate\nmore energy-efficient white light\nto illuminate houses,offices and\neven billboards.A relatively new\ninvention discovered less than 20\nyears ago,blue LEDs are so efficient\nthat if we switched over to this type\nof lighting it has been forecasted\nto cut down the UK\u2019s electricity bill\nby 10%.That been said,this year\u2019s\nNobel Prize in physics is definitely\nmore of an invention-based prize\nrather than the usual discovery-based prize.\nMEDICINE\nThe Nobel Prize in Medicine\nhas been awarded to British-US\nscientist John O\u2019Keefe and married\ncouple May-Britt and Edvard\nMoser from Norway for their work\nand contribution to neuroscience\nresearch.The prize was awarded\nfor work in underpinning particular\ncells in the brain called\u201cplace\ncells\u201dand\u201cgrid cells\u201d.These\nspecific cells act as an inner GPS\nmaking it possible for our brain to\nindentify where we are by firing\nneurotransmitters that are specific\nto a particular environment.It has\nbeen said that these findings will\nbe particularly useful to understand\nthe mechanism of spatial memory\nloss in Alzheimer\u2019s patients.\nCHEMISTRY\nThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry was\nawarded to three scientists: Eric\nBetzig,Stefan Hell and William\nMoerner.Together they harnessed\nthe fluorescence of molecules\nin order to monitor individual\nmolecules within living cells.\nDubbed the\u2018nanoscope\u2019,this new\ntechnology has enabled scientists\nto study molecules smaller than\n0.2 micrometres,a scale previously\noff limits to researchers.This\nnew breakthrough will have a\nmajor role to play in the studies of\ndisease related molecules as well\nas enabling researchers to witness\nevents such as cell division at scales\nmuch smaller than previously\npossible.\nAMRITA GHOSH\npsychedelics with results indicating\nthat LSD holds great potential for\nthe psychotherapeutic aid in the\ntreatment of anxiety, depression and\naddiction.\n\n"

I did the 4 year course,\nthen I did my MRes in 2010/11. And\nsince then, I\u2019ve been doing my PhD.\nB: Where are you from, and how\nhas it affected your outlook on\nImperial?\nA: I\u2019m from Bath. Yeah, I think\nit did influence my outlook on\nImperial. It\u2019s quite a posh little town.\nThe culture shock was somewhat less:\nthe booze price increase when moving\nto London was less pronounced\u2026\nHowever, the change in diversity\nwas large and experiencing different\ncultures coming together in London\nwas great.\nB: Do you think the international\naspect of Imperial is sufficiently\nrepresented in the Union?\nA: We obviously try and represent\neveryone, but I don\u2019t think\nengagement with international\nstudents is good enough. The sabb\nteam is usually white British, and\nthat\u2019s not what we are as a student\npopulation, so it\u2019d be good to improve\nit. How we\u2019d go about doing that is an\ninteresting question.\nB: How are you going to be held\naccountable at the end of this year?\nA: We\u2019re asking Union Council to\nbe far more critical of us, to give us\nstronger feedback and more scrutiny.\nB: I've been told that the sabb\nhierarchy has recently changed. Is\nthe President no longer the boss of\nthe other sabbs?\nA: Yeah, now there is a more\nequal, democratic structure. Tom\nstill chairs things, but he isn\u2019t our\nboss. The President also maintains\nresponsibility.\nB: Abi, the DPCS works with non-sabbs, do you?\nA: I probably work less closely with\nthem than she does, but they are\nthere as a point of advice, and staff\nmembers generally make sure we\u2019re\nasking the right sort of questions. I\nalso get to work with the commercial\nservices and the finance team. A lot\nof what I do now is sorting clubs\u2019\nproblems regarding finances.\nB: Do you know how you're going\nto achieve the main policies you\nsaid you wanted to achieve?\nA: My policies were: clubs and\nsociety policy review - which we\u2019ve\nstarted, more light music in metric,\nand postgraduate engagement in\nH-bar. But right now, sorting out\nWelcome week for Freshers is our\nmain priority.\nB: Are you actually busy? What\ndo you do day to day?\nA: Yeah! I get 50-60 emails a day!\nAnd I thought summer was supposed\nto be relatively free! Replying to the\nrequests takes a long time, it\u2019s very\nhard to clear some time in a day to\nachieve the things I set out to change.\nI tend to work 10-6pm-ish, but there\nhave been days where I\u2019ve done more\n(9-7pm).\nYeah, most of my time is eaten\nup answering emails and going to\nmeetings. I\u2019m currently looking at\nis what stance College will take on\nHigher Education fees.\nB: Do you think Kieron did a\ngood job last year?\nA: No comment, it\u2019s hard to tell.\nYou get a very different perspective\nwhen you\u2019re doing the job itself and\nthat\u2019s going to change in term time\nas well.\nI think there are things he did\nwell and some he didn\u2019t, I know\nsometimes he wasn\u2019t the easiest\nperson to get along with.\nBut I know that I have similar\nproblems, I am trying really hard to\nnot piss anyone off. It\u2019s really hard\nto say: I can see how it\u2019s easy to just\nadequately get through what\u2019s on\nyour plate that day and not achieve\nanything else. It\u2019s hard to judge\nsomeone.\nWith DPFS, positive changes aren\u2019t\nthat visible to others, stuff just goes\nslightly faster or transactions are\nslightly more secure.\nIf I achieve anything positive,\nchances are no one will notice at all\nor the net benefit will come in one or\ntwo years down the line.\nIt\u2019s the danger of being a sabb: your\npositive changes aren\u2019t immediately\nvisible.\nB: Why did you run for a\nsabbatical position?\nA: The Union has been my\nfavourite aspect of Imperial. I\u2019ve been\ninvolved in clubs and societies from\nmy first year. I\u2019ve enjoyed seeing\nhow things have worked and having\ninfluence over how things work. I\u2019ve\nfound some aspects frustrating and I\nwanted to come in and improve it.\nB: How come you only considered\nit after so many years at Imperial?\nA: I considered it before, I just\nnever felt it was the right moment. I\u2019d\nbeen on other boards in the Union,\nbut I wanted more experience before\nbecoming a sabb. This year was\ntheoretically the last year I could have\nran in the elections.\nB: What are you going to do next\nyear?\nA: Finish my Phd, then get a proper\njob!\nB: What do you think about\nChris donating a third of his wage?\nA: Has he actually done it?\nB: Yeah!\nA: Oh really?! It\u2019s very noble. I think\nit\u2019s a good cause. I personally don\u2019t\nthink that I would do the same. It\nmaybe makes me a worse person! But\nit does highlight a debate we should\nhave. We are forced to do a lot more\nwork that some other student unions.\nAnd Imperial grads are some of the\nhighest paid graduates in the world,\nso you need something to to attract\npeople to do another year at the\nUnion.\nSo we can\u2019t necessarily compare\nourselves to other student unions,\nwithout at least baring that in mind.\nHe\u2019s doing it for the message that\nsabbs are overpaid, but I don\u2019t think\nthat\u2019s true, but he\u2019s doing a nice thing\nfor donating.\nB: You said you liked the Union\nas a young student, but there\nanything you dislike about the\nUnion?\nA: Yeah, there are plenty of things\nwhich are frustrating, especially how\nlong it takes for things to get done\nas a club officer. There is a lot more\nto be done. Everything if I didn\u2019t\nthink there were things I didn\u2019t like, I\nwouldn\u2019t have ran for a sabb position.\nI\u2019d love to see the bar play music\nevery night.\nB: Okay, I have some fun\nquestions!\nA: Oh thank you, I must sound like\nthe most boring person ever!\nB: What\u2019s your biggest online\ntimewaster?\nA: Oh that\u2019s difficult, I\u2019ve got lots of\nthem. I\u2019ve been good though, I haven\u2019t\nbeen on Facebook that much lately! I\nspend a lot of time on GPRO, which is\nan online racing management game.\nIn terms of websites, my favourite\none is Neko the Kitty.\nB: If you were trapped on a desert\nisland with the other Sabbs, who do\nyou think you would collectively\neat first?\nA: I\u2019m not sure we\u2019d reach a\ncollective decision! I think we\u2019d all try\nand kill each other!\nB: Who do you think would be\nthe last person to survive?\nA: Me! Nah, I think we would\nprobably gang up on the medic\npresident, Dariush.\nB: If you had to have tinder, what\nbio would you have?\nA: I\u2019ve never thought about it, I\ndon\u2019t have tinder. Playing on other\npeople\u2019s tinder it is fun though.\nI\u2019d probably include that I\u2019m\nmassive nerd, I like sci-fi and riding\nhorses.\nB: If you had to have a first date\non campus because you were so\nbusy with all your sabb duties,\nwhich Imperial establishment\nwould you go to?\nA: It depends on the person. I don\u2019t\nthink I should say a College venue,\nbecause the commercial services\nstaff will hate me. But never mind:\nEastside bar!\nB: Can you recommend any\nplaces or any places to avoid?\nA: I\u2019m in charge of Metric, I have to\nsay Metric!\nB: Oh come on, not an Imperial\none!\nA: Electric Ballroom in Camden.\nWe went to the Ultimate Power night\nthere a few weeks ago. It\u2019s like goth-cheese, ie: very cheesy goth music.\nB: If you had to eat one meal\nfrom 568 for the rest of your life,\nwhat would it be?\nA: Probably the burrito! Better than\nexpected.\nB: Favourite alcoholic drink?\nA: Amaretto.\nB: If you were allowed to name a\nUnion drinking hall, what would\nyou name it? Can you think of a\npun quick enough?!\nA: I would probably turn them\nback into what they used to be called!\nI can\u2019t think of one now, but I still\nthink my suggestion of ICUtube is\nbetter than STOIC\u2019s change to ICTV!\n\" B: Do\nyou think\nKieron did\na good job\nlast year?\nA: No\ncomment.\"\n\"A lot of\nwhat I do\nnow is\nsorting\nclubs\nproblems\nregarding\nfinances.\"\n\"I am\ntrying\nreally\nhard to\nnot piss\nanyone\noff.\"\n\"I still\nthink my\nsuggestion\nof ICUtube\nis better\nthan\nSTOIC's\nchange to\nICTV!\"\nPhoto: Thomas Lim\n\n"
