The significance of the unicorn\nis lost until one discovers that the missing ten\nseconds showed Deckard dreaming of a unicorn in the landscape seen at the end, just\nafter his encounter with Leon. The doubts (if\nyou had them) about Deckard's identity are\nconfirmed and the ending, to my mind, is much\nmore satisfying.\nMiranda F Smith the Anti-clone\nGliding Club\nGlad to see a good turn out at the two\nmeetings we've had so far this term.

    "content": "Mines & Ents\nDear Sir\nOn reading FELIX on Friday\nI was astounded to discover a letter concerning the Mines lack\nof involvement in Fresher s' Week\u2014this being the first I'd heard of it. Now the idea of\nFreshers' Week was, that for the\nfirst time, there would be a coordinated set of activities and\nentertainments in the first week\ninvolving all three CC Us, ICU and IC Ents. A meeting to\narrange details was held in mid-June last term at which the\nrelevant Mines Ents Officer,\nJohn McPherson, was present\nalong with the other C CU Ents\nOfficers, the ICU Exec and\nmyself and other interested\nparties. The result of this\nmeeting was that Ents would be\nresponsible for booking two gigs\nand a film double bill with other\npeople working as agreed. Unfortunately, the person responsible for the smooth running of this event was Phil\nGreenstreet, so whilst I was at\nhome, happily booking bands\nwith Phil's failure there was noone to look after the other\ndetails and chaos was unleashed.\nMeanwhile ICU Exec began to\nassume that Freshers' Week was\nsolely an Ents function, as I suppose did the CC Us and in\nparticular Mines. The events\norganised by Guilds and RCS in\nFreshers' Week showed at least\nthat they were aware of the\nconcept but unfortunately Mines\narranged a week of Freshers'\nevents. I can't blame my old\nmate John Eagleson, I suppose,\nbut as Mines VP he ought to\nhave known where to go tid d ly winking this weekend without\nrelying on me to tell him.\nByll Waterson\nICU Ents Officer\nWellsoc Sexism\nDear Martin\nAs Publicity Officer for the\nHG Wells Society, I feel bound\nto reply to the letter from the\nWIST Officers published in last\nweek's FELIX. In many ways I agree with\nwhat they had to say, and I accept that some people may\nhave found the poster offensive.\nThe reason for using the poster\nin question was to attract\npeople's attention, make them\nread the poster and make them\ncome along to Freshers' Fair. In\nthese respects it has been a resounding success.\nI believe, however, that the\nstudents of Imperial College do\nnot wish to pass aUG M motion\nwhich would effectively censor\nCollege posters. It is gross to\nsuggest, as do the ladies of WIST, that a publicity officer\nshould not use pictures which\nare \"totally irrelevant to their\nsociety in order to advertise its\nexistence\".\nIn conclusion, Wellsoc is\nindeed the society where every-one's face fits, no matter what\ntheir interests, creed or colour or\npolitical allegiance. I can see\nnothing in any poster that I have\nproduced that contradicts this\nadmirable ideal.\nDavid Rowe\nDear Martin\nSo the Wellsoc poster was\noffensive to WIST et al. It was\nmeant to be publicity and to\nstand out amongst the junk that\nmost societies adorned College\nwith over Freshers' Week. What\nwith U GM motions and FELIX articles Wellsoc seems to have\nobtained more attention than\ncould ever have been hoped for,\nwith the added bonus that WIST\nhave taken a free trip on our\npublicity bandwagon.\nI should like to point out that\nWellsoc used a poster with a pair\nof bare breasts last year to\nadvertise a lecture on vampires.\nThere were no U GM motions on\nthat one\u2014perhaps it was thought\nmore artistic than the last! Given\nthis sort of ambiguity in reaction\nhow is a motion calling for\nalmost random, public censorship going to solve any problems?\nWe will probably have running\ncontinued on page 4.\nFind out about\nMarketing\nManagement\nand see if it would suit you\nThe demands of marketing management are high, but so are the rewards - in job\nsatisfaction and material terms. You can find out about the challenge of marketing management by spending five days on Procter & Gamble's Marketing Vacation\nCourse.\nWe are one of the most successful manufacturers of fast\nmoving consumer goods in the world and acknowledged\nleaders in the marketing management field.\nThe UK Company markets such household names as\nAriel, Fairy Liquid, Head & Shoulders,\nCrest, Flash, Daz and Camay.\nBetween 19th and 23rd December, we will be running an\ninformal, but intensive, marketing management course\nfor a group of final year undergraduates a tour Head Office.\nFull accommodation and all expenses will be paid.\nDuring the Course you will actively participate in\nbusiness projects ranging from product development\nand consumer research to television advertising and\nin-st pre promotion.\nThey will give you a real feel of the challenge, intellectual\nstimulation and enjoyment of marketing management,\nand insight into the broad range of activities involved.\nYou will also have a chance to meet some of the wide\nvariety of people with whom a marketing manager works.\nIf you are interested in learning about Marketing\nManagement, you should apply as soon as possible.\nPlease write to Stephen Philpott or David Thomas\nusing an application form available at your\nAppointments/Careers Office, c/o Brand Promotion\nDivision, Procter & Gamble Limited, P.O.

Chris\nDo you ride a bicycle or have you a bike which\nyou would like to ride? Ever wanted to do\nmore than ride it to College, or just make your\nride to College a little more comfortable? If it's yes to any of the above you should consider\njoining the newly formed IC Cycle Club.\nThe main activities relating to actual riding\nare weekly runs for those who want just to\ncycle for pleasure, race training and racing\nitself for those who want to cycle for pain. The\nweekly Sunday runs are already happening,\nthe others will follow when we get more\norganised. Other plans include longer trips,\nsay for weekends, with this possibly including\ncross-Channel excursions (when better\nweather arrives).\nThe other main function of the club is to\nprovide members with the a bil it iy to maintain\nand improve their machines. To this end we\nare already in the process of obtaining over\n\u00a3300 worth of tools. This will allow members to\ndo anything from tightening loose nuts and\nreplacing broken spokes to building wheels\nHopefully the club will also soon be able to\nacquire track bikes, essential for the racing\nside of the club.\nIf you are interested, drop a note to our\nesteemed Captain, Ronan McDonald (Maths\n3) or come along to our regular Sunday ride\n(Beit Arch at 10:00am). Ric Jones (Vice Captain)\nCricket\nTour\nBrilliant tour! Five games\nplayed, one was \u2014 the rest were\neither...lost or drawn. No great\ncricket but John Wints scored\ntwo 50s and Jimmy Hutton did\nthe bowling honours including a hat-trick. (God knows how with\nhis slow left-hand crap!) First\nfixture cancelled due to rain,\ndrove directly to Torquay on the\nlast Tuesday of term. Presence\nwas felt\u2014booted out of 'The\nMusicians Bar', picked up by.the\npolice when we proved very\ndifficult to remove from a 'night\nclub' especially when Phil\nEast land was adamant on\nfinishing the pint that he had\nbought. Between arriving and\nSunday night Jimmy Hutton\nand Chris Thomason downed the\nfifty pint mark. A couple of\nothers requiring a little longer.\nOne night after the boys had\nbeen on the beer\u2014it was the\ngeneral consensus is that Garath\nFish should have a haircut.\nUsing nail scissors half of his\nhair was removed\u2014thanks to\nbeing locked out of Garath's room the job was left incomplete.\nNeil Clarke was the unfortunate\nsubject of a classic comment\nwhich was passed as he strode\nin to bat against Plymstock:\n\" Cor! Don't they grow worms\nbig in London!\"\nRifle & Pistol\nDespite a large turnout during\nthe first two weeks of term, good\nshots are still required for both\ninternal and inter-university\nteams. New features this year\ninclude a club knockout competition, ladies league and numerous shoulder-to-shoulder t duels (Time Higgs' organisation\npermitting). Some high scores\nhave already been registered this\nterm with Tim Higgs shooting a magnificent '96' despite a poor\nstart to the season. (He said \"It\nwould have been a'100', but\nSteve Harrison was talking to\nme!\").\nTo potential marks persons who may have been put off by\nthe crowds in the range, please\nmake the effort to come along.\n' Expert' tuition is always available.\nMembers are invited to attend\nthe open pistol competition and\nclub dinner, to be held on\nDecember 1. Don't worry if you\ncan't shoot, Steve Harrison( Club Captain, contact via Elec\nEng letter-racks) could only\nmanage 4 out of 100 at his last\nattempt. There will also be a club social division pub visit on\nWednesday October 27 (next\nweek) see range officers for\ndetails.\nSquash\nThe club already anticipates a very successful year following an\nastonishing turnout at Freshers'\nFair, both in terms of potential\nmembership and depth of new\ntalent. At the league's AGM last\nweek this prompted us to enter\nan IC V team into the newly\nformed UL USL6 th Division,\nthus hopefully enabling more\nplayers to compete in matches\nduring their time at IC. Partly\ncommensurate with this, but\nalso due to other considerations\nthe club is actively seeking ways\nof increasing its share of the\ntotal court time available at the\nSports Centre.\nThe first matches of this\nseason were played this week;\nfirst result\u2014below strength\nladies team lost narrowly to\nBedford College 3-2.\nThe men's and ladies' ladders\nare being established and will be\nput up after the weekend; see\nnoticeboard at Sports Centre for\ndetails.\nCross Country\nThe club had a very promising\nstart to the season competing in\nthe Southern Universities Cross\nCountry League on the first\nSaturday of term. Running for\nLondon Univ, we finished fifth\nout of twenty-two teams (four of\nthe six scoring runners were\nfrom IC), with newcomer Andrew\nGriffiths finishing a creditable\nfortieth despite running the\nmuddy six mile course in training\nflats. In the ladies race Mandy\nTin dall showed that early\nmorning training pays dividends\nby finishing second to take the\nLondon side into sixth position.\nNot bad for a1 member team.\nLast Saturday on a very wet\nHampstead Heath the club\nfielded two teams in the University College Relays. Graham\nHarker and Hugh Dixon got the\nfirst team off to a good start but\nit took a fast last leg run by Jon\nLea to bring us into the top ten,\ngiving it plenty of time to get\nback for the all-important cross\ncountry tea.\n\n"

    "content": "continued from front page\nGeneral, not wishing to take the\nblame for the unpopular fares\nrise, gave the GLCa dispensation to keep their fares increase\nbelow50%. Mr Livingstone rejoices in future possibilities for\nLabour governments: dispensing\nlocal authorities from comp li ance with hangovers of Tory legislation. He maintains that\nthe court case was' War in Principle' and that legal authorities were devastated by the\nadverse result. Mrs Thatcher would rather give in to the\nArgentinians than give in to the\nGLC, he said. Further fare cuts\nare apparently in the pipeline\nafter the end of the financial year\ndespite government demands for\na twelve percent rise. Ken Livingstone believes that there\nwill have to be a dramatic turnaround in public transport\nto prevent vital business being\nsucked out of London by the\nnew orbit M25 motorway.\nOn Civil Defence the speech\nmoved from black humour, to\ndeadly seriousness. If there is a nuclear war, Mr Livingstone would be required to help the\nmilitary to root out C ND activists( no doubt including himself). He described in graphic\ndetail the horrifying six million\ndeath roll of a two megaton strike. Protect and Survive he\ndescribed as a monumental ton describing the whole exercise as\na deliberate lie. The GLC intends to go into open conflict\nwith the government over the\nNuclear Free Zone for London and hopes to force an open Parliamentary debate on the\nconfidential Queens Order Two plan to seal off London. There were several questions\nafter the speech. The question of\nrates was raised, from several\nangles, and Mr Livingstone pointed out that the Fare's Fair\npolicy with a comparable government subsidy could put 15p on the rates; without subsidy it\nwould cost \u00a31.50.\nDebsoc\nComes Out\nThe newly reconstituted Debating Society held its first event for\nfour years on Monday. The motion 'This House believes that\nMultilateralists live in a Dream World', proposed by Michael\nNorman and seconded by La Iatrou, was defeated by Nick Sketch, who was seconded by\nStephen Curry.\nWith the Dossible exception of\nMiss Iatrou, of all the speakers\nhad obviously had previous debating experience. Most impressive was Mr Curry, whose\ntechnique and use of charming\nmetaphors complemented Mr Sketch's solid arguments. In the\nvoting at the end, the opposition\nreceived three times as many\nvotes as the proposer s. Membership of the society\nnow stands at over fifty, most of\nwhom are expected to speak at\nleast once every year; the\norganisers are determined to\navoid regular speakers. Future\nevents include a debate on Public Schools with external speakers, including a Conservative MP and the Chairman of the\nILEA. Free sherry will be on\noffer next week as an added\ninducement to attend the debate\non the Health Service.\nPINOCCHIO\n\u2022 mmm mam mmm mam mmm in order to make some money and relieve the\nburden on the hard-pressed taxpayer, British\nRail intend to operate some special excursions\non the scenic route between the resorts of\nHigher Pay rise and KiH in buck ton. Killinbuckton is a terminus (the last resort?), and\nthe train will have to be turned around. The\ntrain is to comprise the steam locomotive 'the\nFlying Picket', one second class car, one\nrestaurant car, and a Pullman observation car,\nwith windows in the rear.\nThe layout of track at Killinbuckton is in the\nform of a triangle, as shown. The figures\nindicate how many vehicles will fit in each\nsection of track.\nThe problem, then, is this:\n1. The train arrives from Higher Payrise in\nthe order: locomotive, second class coach,\nrestaurant car, Pullman car; it must leave in\nthe same order, but facing in the opposite\ndirection.\n2. The locomotive and the Pullman car\nmust have been turned around when they\nleave, the restaurant car and the second class\ncoach need not be.\n3. Killinbuckton is entirely flat, hence no\nrolling of vehicles is allowed.\n4. Nothing can move without being coupled\nto the locomotive.\n5. Everything must be at a standstill for\ncoupling or uncoupling to take place (no\n'pushing').\nWhat is the minimum number of moves\nrequired to turn the train (the first move\nstarts with the train standing on the line from\nHigher Payrise; a move ends whenever the\nlocomotive has to stop for coupling, uncoupling\nor a change of direction)?\nSolutions, comments,criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 from\nMenda-Bike for a randomly selected entry.\nThe terminus at Killinbuckton\nLast Week's Solution\nLast week's problem was rather trivial, but\nfor those of you who failed to obtain the\nsolution,\nQuentin went with Mary\nRichard went with Mungo\nSteve went with Mandy\nTim went with Midge\nOf the sixteen entries, the winner was, for\nthe second time, Jim Ward of Chem Eng 1 (I assure you I don't know him!), who can\ncollect his prize on Monday (after 1:30pm please).\nGeneral Reisenschein\nAll right, I'm sorry, in the second statement\nof General Reisenschein's problem I did use\nthe word 'congruent'. What I meant was, the\nsame size and shape, and I was just saving\nspace, and unfortunately, making a mistake at\nthe same time. Also, I shall admit that the\ndissection is not terribly convenient for offices,\nconsisting as it does, of two rooms, but here\nyou are, the moment you've all been waiting\nfor.\nGeneral Reisenschein's Offices\nOn the second try, nineteen people solved\nthe problem, and the winner(s) chosen at\nrandom was Gary Smith, Ci vEng3, in\ncollaboration with Susan Griffiths, and Gary\ncan pick up the cheque on Monday from the\nFELIX Office.\nBanana's Revenge\nCongratulations to anyone who managed to\nsolve this problem.

    "content": "Feast of Terror\nDanton's Death by Georg Biichner, in a version by Howard Brenton. Directed by\nPeter GUI, the Olivier, National Theatre.\nThe tumultuous events occurring in\nrevolutionary France in the year 1794 provide\nthe setting for Buchner's Danton's Death. The\nperiod of 'The Terror', when the guillotine\nseldom stood idle, provides a very fertile\nground for Buchner's penetrating observation\nof two opposing forces of man.\nThe two central characters are Danton\n(played by Brian Cox) and Robespierre\n(excellently portrayed by Tom Georgesonk as\na very sinister character). Danton is a one-time\nnational hero who stands for freedom and\nsensuality, but whose passivity against the\nsweeping tide of the revolution hastens his\ndeath at the hands of Robespierre. The latter\npersonality, who led the revolution at the time,\nrepresents virtue and social order. But a knowledge of the French Revolution is not\nrequired to appreciate Buchner' s superb\nanalysis of two opposing ideologies, attitudes\nto life and personalities. The work is profound\nand cool y analytic, turning over all kinds of\nphilosophical stones, but the epic drama an\nalmost scientific objectivity. The play represents quite an intellectual feast, but\nabove all the National Theatre production is\nvery successful at sowing the seed of doubt.\nOne finds oneself questioning dearly held\nbeliefs, and in this respect the play is one of the\nmost disturbing one is likely to come across in\nWALKABOUTLOOKSEC\nby Mobile Optics Inc.\nGetting There\nThis week's outing involves a bit more walk about than the last one: the Tate Gallery,\nMillbank. In true British style, as you emerge\nfrom the tube station there are several well-meaning signposts to the Tate, but the area is\ncurrently full of road works and after a couple\nof hundred year ds the useful signposts are\nreplaced by bright yellow on essaying' Diverted Traffic'... no mention of the\nwhereabouts of the Gallery. So I 've drawn a sketch map; it's about a three minute walk.\n. The Tate houses a British Collection of\nworks from the sixteenth century to around\n1900 and the National Collection of Modern\nArt: this consists of works by British artists\nborn after 1850, and of foreign works from\nthe Impressionists onwards.\nThe Gallery also organises temporary\nexhibitions, both major ones and smaller\ndisplays. I went along this week to see two of\nthe small exhibit on s. Howard Hodgkin's Indian Leaves\nThese were made by Howard Hodgkin whilst\nhe was staying in Ahmedabad in November\n1978. Every day he received leaves of specially\nhandmade paper, still wet from the factory, on\nwhich he painted before they dried. The paints\nused were the traditional vegetable dyes used\nto colo ukr Indian textiles: he asked for a Mughal red, Indian ochre, as many different\ngreens as possible and so on. His 'Indian\nLeaves' have a tropical richness and intensity\nof colour that convey most vividly the hot,\nsteamy-jungle atmosphere and the dust and\nbrightness of s markets and fruits.\nEach image is painted in two versions: they\nREVIEWS!\nLondon at the present time.\nThe play is all the more remarkable in that it\nwas written in 1835 when the author was a mere twenty one years old. Buchner is\nperhaps more famous for his Woyzeck, but\nDanton's Death shows not traces of its being\nhastily written, composed as it was under great\npressure in less than five weeks (while he was\nunder close police surveillance for his political\nactivities).\nMany of the cast have come straight from\nthe production of The Prince of Homburg by\nvon Kleist at the Cottesloe Theatre. Buchner\nand von Kleist show remarkable similarities;\nboth had a scientific training, both wrote their\nworks when they were very young, and both\ntheir style s are analytic and objective but\nintensely dramatic. For those of you who ah ve seen The Prince (it is now finished), Danton's Death makes an interesting comparison.\nNick Bedding\npic n/w iu ACCEPT^\n\u2022Wt MARKET ff t Cfc7 rfd i. YooR. IAB90R,\nHHPCowUiNEtW\nare hung as pairs. Variations are due to the\nstate of drying of the paper and the fact that\npaper dried so rapidly in the heat of India,\ndecisions about composition and colouring\nhad to be taken almost instantly and there was\nno time for reinterpretation between the two\nversions. Another effect of working with wet\npaper is that the dyes actually penetrate the\npaper. They do not all mix equally well, giving\noutlines either sharp or fuzzy and a surface\nfinish which shines like lacquer or is softly\nmatt. It's a fascinating process and the end\nproduct is most evocative in India.\nPrints in Gallery 61\nThe fifty-five prints and works on paper\nshowing in Gallery 61 were mostly acquired by\nthe Tate in the last two years.\nThe word' print' is a muddling one\nembracing anything from the pattern on a piece of cloth, to the cheap copy of a Van\nGogh painting. In this context it applies to the\ngraphic processes of lithography, relief-,\nintaglio-, and screen-printing. Rather than\npainting directly on canvas or paper, the artist\nfirst makes a 'tool' and then uses it to produce\nan 'edition' of identical impressions.\nSeventeen different artists are represented,\nand as many different approaches to 'art'.\nWhat is the most minimal visual information\nHouse of Wax\nCertificate AA, starring Vincent Price,\nPhyllis Kirk, now showing exclusively at\nABC Fulham Road.\nFollowing the unexpected success of Comin\nat Ya (a rather poor Western) in America,\nthere has been a recent revival in 3-D films.\nNot only are Jaws 3 and possibly Halloween 3\nbeing filmed in the process, but also Friday the\n13th, part 3 which has already opened in\nAmerica.\nOn the tail of the surge Warners have wisely\ndecided to revive the earliest and perhaps best\nknown3 D film House of Wax ( which catapulted Vincent Price to stardom in 1953).\nFilmed in 'Natural Vision' and 'WarnerColor' it\nis a beautiful and strangely atmospheric horror\nfilm, which contains a few genuine shocks and\nuses the process fairly effectively.\nVincent Price (in a part he has constantly\nreprised during his career) plays Henry Jarrod,\na brilliant wax sculptor who idol is es his artistic\ncreations and resists his partner's attempts to\nstart a Chamber of Horrors. When said\npartner burns down their unsuccessful business for the insurance Jarrod disappears\nand is presumed to be dead. The scene is set\nA sample from Further Down on Maggie's Farm by Steve Bell (Penguin \u00a32.95). These two\nframes are from the Adventures of Lord God Almighty, who joins Steve's other victims (the\ngovernment, Freddie Laker, the SDP, etc, etc)\nin another of his very funny cartoon books.\nnecessary to define a work of art? This is the\nquestion answered by Sol LeWitt's 'Lines in\nFour Directions' and by the series of distorted\nsquares within circles of Robert Mangold: his is\na fascinating experiment in seeing versus\nperceiving.\nOther works concern not perceptual abstraction but images grown from figures and\nidentifiable objects. Eduardo Paolozz'i's Heads\nare delimited by struts and scaffolding. Their\ninternal workings are those of robots or space\nstations and bear no relation to a dissection\nclass.\nAnd some works are just plain witty. In\n'Farm Animals', Marcel Broodthaers has given\ncounty-show-specimens of cattle the names of\nBMW, Mercedes, etc! A tongue-in-cheek\nmanipulation of the literal meaning we attach\nto brand images created in glossy ads.\nThis little exhibition will appeal to anyone\nwith a visual sense of humour.\nWhere, when \u00a3?\nBoth exhibitions are at the Tate Gallery,\nMillbank, open Mon-Sat 10:00am5:50 pm, Sun\n2:00-5:50pm.

    "content": "News Reporting\nI 've moaned about this before\n(as have editors since FELIX was conceived) but so much\ncriticism is flying at the moment\nthat I'd like to straighten out a few points, particularly in view\nof the letter from Adrian James,\nmy news editor, which is printed\nopposite.\nNews editing is probably the\nmost difficult job on the staff of\nFELIX. To stop the news\nsounding stale, almost all the\nresearch and all the writing has\nto be done on Wednesday afternoon (when undergraduates\nare next to impossible to con-tact), and then the sub-editing,\ntypesetting, pasting-up and\nprinting are all done in one mad\nrush on Thursday.\nSecondly, people often exaggerate the facts (you should have\nheard the R CSU version of the\nmascot ry raid and compared it\nwith Guilds'; I scarcely believed\nthey were telling me about the\nsame event!) or tell deliberate\nuntruths. We do try our best to\npresent the facts as they happen,\nbut the news editor is less than\nomnipresent and we have to rely\non oral reports from members of\nCollege who (and here's the rub)\nare prepared to phone the\nFELIX Office and tell us the\nnews.\nThirdly, an enormous amount\nof news is 'of a sensitive nature'.\nIn five issues of FELIX so far\nproduced, including two postgraduate issues, there have been\nfour stories which I have\nwithheld at the request of the\nvarious people involved, and a further one which perhaps I would have withheld had I EDITORIAL\nreceived enough information in\ntime. But it isn't possible even to\nseek out all the people who\nknow the facts about a story, let\nalone find all those likely to\nknow some reason why it should\nnot be printed; and, apart from\nthis, people must take responsibility for their decisions and\nactions, and if they do or say\nsomething in public which they\nlater regret, am I to be blamed\nfor reporting it in a way which\nbrings out the features of their\nactions which have mass appeal?\nThe news pages are supposed to\nbe interesting; after all.\nDo I need to spell out the\nconclusion of this outburst? We\nneed more news staff. Anyone\nwho has any aspirations at all in\nthis direction, be it interviewing,\nresearching, writing or whatever,\nshould come and find either me\nor Adrian in the FELIX Office,\npreferably on Fridays or Mon days to introduce yourself, or on\nWednesday afternoons to work.\nAlso, we need news. If anything\nof interest, however\" slight,\nhappens in your lab, your lectures, your committee, your\nC CU or whatever, we need to\nhear about it. And finally, the\nresponsibility for what I publish\nrests with me. The responsibility\nfor your words and deeds,\nreported accurately in FELIX, rests with you.\nFELIX Staff\nNew reporting aside, we are still\nvery short-staffed on FELIX, and will welcome anyone who is\nprepared to give up some time,\nhowever irregularly, to help\nproduce this newspaper. No previous experience is necessary\n(in the case of collating it's not\neven desirable) as we will teach\n' you all the various skills involved in graphics work, layout,\ndesign, or whatever turns you\non, as they say. We particularly,\nurgently, desperately need\npeople to help on Thursdays\nbetween 2:30 and 5:30pm when\nthe paper is finally put to bed,\nbut most of the regular staff\nhave lectures, practicals, and so\nforth. If anyone is even remotely\ninterested, come to the FELIX Office anytime today or early\nnext week and introduce your-self.\nWe also need colla tors. Collating consists of slipping the\nfolded sheets of FELIX inside\none another and needs no skill\nwhatsoever( even Stephen Goulder has been known to\nhelp.) Just turn up on Thursday\nevening and join in the convivial\nsocial atmosphere, and help the\nother staff members calm the\nEditor as the folding machine\nbreaks down yet again. Collating\nusually starts at around 7:30pm and goes on late, but come for as\nmuch or as little as you like.\nU GM Although you might not have\nguessed it from the appalling\nlack of publicity, there is an\nimportant Union General Meeting next Tuesday at 1:00pm in\nthe Great Hall. At this meeting,\nthe various candidates for\nDeputy President of the Union\nwill make their hustings speech-es, so come along and find out\nwho you want to administer\nyour finances next year.\nIF and RCM If anyone from the Institut\nFranpais or the Xoyal College of\nMusic would like to act as a semi-official representative of\ntheir respective college on the\nstaff of FELIX( even if all they\ndo is collect a bundle of copies\nevery Friday,) would they please\nget in touch.\nImpossible Without\nLee Paddon, Mark Smith, Nick\nBedding and Nick Willson for\nreviews, Tim Noyce, Peter\nRodgers, Dave Rowe for pasting\nup and generally being helpful,\nHugh Southey for What's On,\nPinocchio and Walk about Looksee for their respective\ncolumns, Caroline Foers for\noffering to do anything within\nreason (!), Adrian James for the\nnews, Dave W Parry for photo-graphs, Chris Mall a band for sport, Nick Pyne for the centre\nspread, Maz, Peter, and anyone\nI 've forgotten in the rush.\nMartin S Taylor\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 l\"^ \u2014\n\u2014\n(\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nt=3,11111111111111t=3, MARY FREEMAN may be one\nof the most hardworking Honorary Secretaries the Union has\nseen in recent years, but she is\nnot, it has to be said, one of the\nmost wildly popular. Whether it\nis her insistence on sticking to\nevery minutest tittle of the\nstatute book (not in itself a bad\nthing) or the curious stony-faced\nexpression she wears as she\nquotes verbatim long extracts\nfrom Union regulations Idon't know, but nevertheless she is\nbecoming rather disliked by\nseveral members of the Union,\nand it was a close-run thing\nwhen she was ill last week and\nCouncil agreed to send her a Get\nWell Soon card by fourteen\nvotes to twelve with three\nabstentions.\nOne of the Honorary Secretary's jobs is the allocation of\nparking permits, and it was\nbrought to my attention that\nsome malicious wit had submitted an application in the\nname of a fictitious student;\nfurthermore, this student had\nbeen deemed worthy of a much-coveted permit. After a little\nresearch I managed to track\ndown the application in quest-ion, and feel it is worth reproducing in full:\nT am devout muslim and I have\ncome to college because there is\nmosque on the College premises.\nAs for this I have to stay in\nCollege in evening to pray before\nI go away to home.

In last week's column\n22,1982\nI related several less than\ncomplimentary tales concerning\nex-Editor Steve Marshall. This\nweek I found him supposedly\nworking in the FELIX Office on\nhis own. Being naturally curious,\nand wondering what had induced him to lend his talents so\ngenerously, I took a look at the\npage he was working on, and\ndiscovered, to no great surprise,\nthat he had been switching\nround the signatures on the\nLetters to the Editor.\nIT HAS almost become traditional to criticise Victor Mooney\nin this newspaper; how refresh-ing,' then, that his first mention\nin this column is to commend\nhim for his humility last Saturday when, in the absence of three\nof his staff, he tied an apron\nround his ample girth and spent\nmost of the afternoon washing\nup.\n|Poge5\n\n"

    "content": "ISPORT\n^ Hockey\nFirsts\nIC vs UCL70A rainy day. but a promising\nstart for the first eleven in their\nfirst game of the season. With\nfour new players in the side,\nImperial began the game eager\nto show the form that has won\nus the College league for the past\nfew years.\nAfter a tentative start, IC started stringing some good passes together creating good\nwill on the field and covering\nback well. This possession was\nsoon converted to a well-taken\ngoal by Garme-. and by half-time\nthe score was 3-0 UCL were\ndenied several chances in the\nfirst half by a good first performance by Tony Atkins who\nwas substituted to allow another\nsweeper Andy Stuart to play his\nfirst game for Imperial.\nThe second half found IC playing more good open hockey\nbut the lack of fitness was very\nevident as the game progressed\n(hmmm...Geoff.'). However, a further l our goals \u2014 giving Gar mesa hattrick \u2014 ended a promising game. It won't be as\neasy on Saturday. Don't forget\ntraining. Tuesday12:30 pm Union Gym. Team: Ayres (2).

Pitkethley.\nSeconds\nIC vs Amersham 1-1\nThe stench of the still unwashed\nfirst team shirts circulated around the worried laces of the\nsecond team. Who would go in\ngoal if Skitter did not appear?\nEldridge was the reply, at least\nthe mask would keep him quiet.\nBut then a flash of light and the\ngoalie entered stage right. So out\ninto the wind and rain went the\nbrave bunch and found themselves immediately dominated\nby an Amersham team who rewarded any skill on the part of\nIC with a tactless stick in the\nlegs. The team battled hard with\nSlatter playing a blinder in goal.\n( For once commented an unkind\nvoice). Unfortunately though we\nwere unable to stop the opposition grabbing a short corner\ngoal.\nA tactical rearrangement at\nhalf-time and also deciding to\ndrop to the opposition's level\nproduced a gritty and a mighty\nphysical performance. The IC forwards now remembering where the goal was actually put\nsome shots in that direction and\nsomehow Dub lon ski managed\nto slot in an equalise r through a forest of players.\nSo another good result for the\nseconds mainly due to inspired\nleadership (?) and a faultless\nCunningham performance, but\nthen again Sweeper is such an\neasy position to play!\nTeam: Rolf, Pete, Andy, Tony,\nDuncan, Pete, Chaz, Roger, Paul,\nSimon, David, Nigel.\nThirds\nIn order to encourage a fast,\nopen game, IC 3rd XI chose to\nplay with only eight men on\nSaturday. This brave tactical gamble narrowly failed to pay\noff despite a spirited performance from all concerned.\nFine defensive work from Bailey and Mod ley and a penalty\nflick save from Hepper kept IC\nin the game early on and gave\nrise to numerous spirited charges\ndown the field from Ward, Jones\nand acting captain Purdy. Close\nto the opposition goal, however,\nIC found it difficult to break\ndown a tight defence, although\nSalter came close to scoring on\nseveral occasions.\nICs positive approach led (on\noccasion) to a lack of cover in\ndefence and OC's look advantage\nof the opportunity to score four\ntimes during the game. The fine\nspirit in which the match was\nplayed was graphically illustrated when a mis-hit shot from\nLyons was generously helped\ninto the goal by an opposition\ndefender\u2014thus ensuring a well\ndeserved consolation for IC at\nthe end of a strenuous afternoon.\nRugby\nFirsts\nIC vs St Thomas's1210 The match against St Thomas' was played in the morning diu\nto the International in the\nafternoon, and as a result many\nwere still suffering from the\nnight before escapades. One person even had make-up on!\nAnyway. St Thomas' won the\ntoss and played with the wind.\nAs a consequence IC were\nimmediately put under pressure\nby the long kicks of their fly-hall. This resulted, in them going\nBreaking loose at Harlington. Photo: Steve Bishop\nover for a try in the corner;\nputting a penalty over; and dropping a goal, in the first ten\nminutes. 0-10. The IC forwards\nnow started to play, and the\nfront five were pushing their\nopponents all over the part. Thus, at half-time IC were still\nonly 10-0 down.\nIn the second half the forwards\ncontinued their dominance, and\nIC spent the majority of the time\nin St Thomas'25. This was\nrewarded with a try under the\npost by W King, after a for-wards' drive; and a penalty which was converted by HM cDo wall. The score was now\n9-10 and though IC came close\non many occasions they could\nnot get the last score. However,\nin the last seconds of the match\nIC were given another penalty in\nfront of the posts. HM cDo wall converted this, and IC won 12-10.\nTeam: M Thompson. W Chapman. H McDouall. G Pike.

First stop on this\nepic journey (organised by W King) was Colliers Wood, a pleasant little suburb at the end\nof the Northern Line, apparently\nlacking in both pubs and rugby\nteams. After a quick spin of the\ncompass (and a few phone calls)\nit was back up the northern line\nand off to Richmond. At this\npoint there were several remarks\nto the tune of' Orange Tree' and\n'Youngs Special\", and even the\ncasual 'get pissed\".\nAfter arriving at Richmond it\nwas taxis tok Petersham and legs\nthe rest of the wav.

However\nwith increased organisation and\neffort in the second half we got\nback into the game. Goals by\nJohn Healy and Torsen Behling\nput us into the lead, before the\nhighlight of the game: a powerful\ntoe poke from John, fired straight at the goalkeeper, which\nwas somehow fumbled over the\nline.

Whereas I can\nsometimes contact society officials who have internal telephones, finding under graduates on a Thursday afternoon when there are six other\nnews stories to write up is just\nnot possible.\nContrary to popular belief\nand established precedent, we do\ntry to print news as accurately as\npossible. In the case of the WIST article of a fortnight ago, my\ninformation was supplied by\nWell soc(a very publicity conscious organisation) and from that bottomless pit (of\ninformation) the Union Office,\nin the absence of any attempt by\nMesdemoiselles Nah on and Watts to contact me.\nHenceforth, any complaints\nfrom societies which have performed some vaguely newsworthy feat and made no attempt\nto supply us with information\nwill be studiously ignored. Anyone who believes that it is a reporter's function to seek out\ninformation should apply to the\nFELIX Office for the job( people who have had to look up\nmore than three words in this\nletter need not apply). Until I have a news staff of more than\ntwo people (will they breed in\ncaptivity?) you will have to put\nup with what 1 write.\nYour raving reporter\nAdrian James\nNews Editor\nRCS Thuggery\nDear Sir\nWe have reason to complain\nof the R CSU lackeys and minions\nwho organised the Chemistry\nFreshers' Dinner on Tuesday\nOctober 19.\nI, and three friends, were\nholding a conversation in an\nisolated part of the J CR \u2014 away from the 'action'\u2014when we were\napproached by Mr Charles Fuller, RC SHon Sec, and told,\nnay ordered, to leave the premises. On our reluctance to\ncomply\u2014due to our rights to\nremain in the J CR under Union rules\u2014Chas brought over his\n'heavies' and threatened us with\nviolence, telling us lo ' Fuck Off and if we did not leave we would\nbe forcibly ejected from the\nroom.\nWe began to leave peacefully\nbut harassment continued and\nmy three colleagues actually pushed through the doors.\nWe believe that this behaviour\nwas unjustified and offensive.\nEven one of the ' bouncers' admitted that we had the right to\nbe there but he wanted a pint so\nwe had to get out.\nWe demand a printed apology\nand a commitment that this will\nnever happen to us or any other\nstudents again.\nYours sincerely\nJon Clark\nC Burgess\nRobert Reynolds\nPaul Griffin\nGlass-handed\nDear Sir\nOKI let Mark Smith get away\nwith it once but now he has\nrepeated his error. The classic\nOuter Limits episode ' Fiend with\na Glass Hand' by Ray Bradbury\ndoes not exist. The classic Outer\nLimits episode ' Demon with a Glass Hand' by Harlan Ellison\ndoes. This was the episode about\nan android, Trent, who had to\nsave the entire human race,\nstored on a bit of fuse-wire in his\nhand, from a marauding gang of\nthird rate actors wearing black\nbalaclava helmets. It is a classic\nbecause it is the only episode not\nfeaturing an alien with a head\nlike a melon.\nI always preferred The Twilight\nZone series.\nYours\nRoy Grainger\nPhil Nathan\u2014\nthe true facts\nrevealed\nDear Martin\nWith reference to your editorial in last week's FELIX condemning my so-called 'hypo-cris y', here are a few facts which\nI feel 'deserve a wider audience'.\n1. The' wonderful' letter which you quote from the R CSU Broadsheet as written by Debbie\nCooper, was, so 1 have been\ninformed, not actually written\nby her, nor did she know that\nany such article was going to be\nincluded in Broadsheet. It\nappears that the letter was a fabrication\u2014a forgery.\n2. The contents of the letter\nare simply not true, ie they are\neither lies or the result of some\nimmense mistake on the au' hor's part. I in no way en cou aged Ms\nDebbie Cooper to dress up in\n\" nothing but a sweatshirt and\nunderwear\". I was not present\nwhen it took place and did not\nPhil Nathan:\nSexist stocking filler?\nfind out that this had happened\nuntil alter the event.\nFollowing your 'strong con-dem nation' of my hypocrisy and\nyour attitude towards the\nmotion on the Jez Queen at the\nRCS Freshers' UG M.I realise\nhow much the above will disappoint you; but there you go.\nThere can be no excuse for\nprinting libellous statements\nhowever reliable the source, and\na little bit more care will earn\nFELIX much greater respect.\nYours 'hippo'-critically\nPhilip B Nathan\nBiochem 3\nDear Sir\nPhil Nathan is not a hypocrite\nas you claim in your editorial.\nDeb Cooper did not write a letter\nin Broadsheet claiming Phil encouraged her to advertise sweatshirts by parading herself\nin nothing but a sweatshirt and\nunderwear, someone else did.\nThe truth is that I and Debbie\nboth decided to model the\nsweatshirts (we both paraded in\nsweatshirts and' underwear') and we didn't tell Phil till later.\nYour editorial has unwittingly\nplayed into the hands of those in\nRCS who would discredit Phil\nNathan and his (and others in\nLife Sci' attempt to changeR CSU to a form more desirable\nto its members, and the crude\nand dirty tactics they employ.\nPhil Nathan remains a most\nrespected ex-Life Sci Dep Rep\namongst Life Scientists if not the\nrest of the College, many of us\nfind his attempts to change RCS from within laudable and sincere\nif perhaps in vain.\nGeoff Evans\nLS2 Soc Rep\nSince I had checked the\nfacts with Debbie before I wrote the Editorial, I felt\nit only fair to allow her\nthe right of reply -Ed.\nDear Martin\nHaving read the letters for\nFELIX this week I would like to\ncomment further on one or two\npoints:\n1. The letter in Broadsheet\nthough not personally penned\nwas written under my instruction\nand on info received from me. I certainly had knowledge of its\ninclusion in Broadsheet before\nBroadsheet was produced.\n2. I repeat that Phil had knowledge of this 'modelling' of\nLife Sc iT shirts before it\noccured (though the idea was\nprincipally Geoff s) and Phil suggested we might like to repeat\nthe performance for Life Sci 2!\nTherefore, apparently condoned\nthe idea.\n3. Principally this was not\nintended as a personal dig at\nPhil' s politics, merely his irresponsible attitude by putting\nforward such a motion at the\nFreshers' U GM.

A team\nfrom the Royal College of Science Union attempted to steal\nthem as they were unloaded but\non being confronted by superior\nnumbers they were forced, by\nmascot ry rules, to retire.\nLater, a larger group of about\nsixty charged the S CR, and during the ensuing scuffle a glass\ndoor was shattered showering\nDr Cory and the student sitting\nnext to him with broken glass.\nThe student received several cuts\nfor which first aid was administered.

' Red Ken' is an expert speaker and with all the facts and figures at\nNo. 624B HMM fl BH HB Ji his fingertips he was well able to\ndeal with the points raised.\nMr Livingstone described the\nconvoluted legal background to\nthe Law Lords' quashing of the\nGreater London Council's fares\npolicy; the legal precedent used\nwas the suppression of Poplar\nCounty Council's attempt to give women equal wages in 1900.\nMore recently the Attorney continued on back page\nThe final attempt was made\njust before the after dinner speeches, when some forty students gained access through\ntwo previous bolted doors. It\nwas then that Professor Ander son demonstrated his hitherto\nunsuspected wrestling prowess.\nDr Cory was later heard to\nremark that he wished that all formal dinners were as entertain-ing.\nAs a result of the damage\ncaused during the raid, ICU President Stephen Gould er summoned the three C CUP residents and drew their attention to existing mascot ry rules, notably that there should\nbe now anton violence or destruction. An agreement was\nalso reached that there should be\nno speeding by C CU vehicles on the campus and that all damaged\nand injuries sustained during\nmascot ry raids should be rep or ted immediately to the Union. The Royal College of Science\nUnion has accepted- responsibility for the damage to the door, for which they are expected to receive a bill from the\nEstates section.\n|Friday, October 2 2 , 1982|\n\n"

None of the expected\nproblems from police or Chelsea\nCollege arose.\nNearly a hundred and fifty\nstudents from the three Constituent College Unions started\nfrom The Vale and tid d ly winked up King's Road to Sloane Square. This represented a break\nfrom tradition, as until this year\ntid d ly winking has always taken\nplace along Oxford Street, but\nafter warnings from police and\nsome trouble over collecting licences the event was twice put\noff and a new venue found.\nIn keeping with tradition, however, the contingent from\nthe Royal School of Mines winked their tid d les single mindedly down the middle of the\nroad, while the more cautious\nmembers of C&G and RCS used\nthe pavements. The route took\nthem past Chelsea College, which was expected to be\nregarded by their students as an\ninfringement on their territory;\nbut there was no visible reaction\nfrom within. Furthermore, police presence'was limited to a discreet inspector, two sergeants\nand three constables who raised\nno legal objections until Sloane\nSquare was reached. At this\npoint the students were asked\nnot to propel their counters across the pedestrian crossings,\nas they had already caused a certain amount of traffic congestion. The event drew to a close with\nringo roses around Sloane Square. The students then descended en masse on the\nRoyal Court tavern, where some\ncustomers complained of being\nharassed by overeager collectors.

    "content": "IICU COUNCILI\nFELIX proudly presents the:\nBluffers Guide to\nIC Union\nTo the uninitiated, the Union may appear to be nothing more than a meeting place for hacks, a chance for self-glorification for a few\npompous individuals. The truth is somewhat different: much of the work\nof the Union is concerned with the day-to-day administration of all the\nclubs and societies and such 'hidden extras' as academic and social\nwelfare. Since there is often considerable misunderstanding or just\nplain bewilderment about the various committees, Nick Pyne has set out\na brief account of how they function, their membership,'their\nresponsibilities, and some of their failings.\nUnion General\nMeetings\nThis is the sovereign body of the Union, and\ncan dictate policy to any Union committee.\nUG Ms are infrequent, and usually bogged\ndown in proceed ure, so a smaller body exists\nto fulfil this function in mundane matters\u2014\nthe Union Council,\nUnion Council\nIC Union Council,1\n' which consists of the\npeople whose mug shots you see here, has a similar raison d'e tre to UG Ms. The idea is to\nhave representatives of the various viewpoints likely to be prevalent in College\nso that a reasonable discussion of any points\nof relevance to the Union in general can take\nplace, and not simply be decided by the\nexecutive.\nCouncil is supposed to meet regularly two\nor three times a term to monitor some of the\nthings too mundane to be\nbrought to aUG M, as well as to\nfill gaps in policy until further\npolicy can be formed at aUG M. In practice, Council suffers\nfrom much the same maladies as\ndoes the U GM \u2014 procedural wrangles abound and towards\nthe end of the year Council is\nrarely quo rate. The situation is\naggravated by the fact that most\npeople know the others present,\nand there are usually few there\nwho are totally sober, so meetings tend to drag on until\nboredom or in quo racy( or just\noccasionally there being no\nfurther business) terminates the\nmeeting.\nThe Executive\nSTEPHEN GOULD ERIC U PRESIDENT7 ICU DEPUTY PRESIDENT2* MARY FREEMAN ICU HON SECRETARY STEPHEN BISHOP CITY AND GUILDS UNION PRESIDENT KARL SCHMIDT ROYAL COLLEGE OF SCIENCE UNION PRESIDENT NIGEL WALLS ROYAL SCHOOL OF MINES UNION PRESIDENT Major Subcommittees\nMATTHEW TONKS SCAB CHAIRMAN Societies Debating\nDrama\nJazz\nOpera\nFilm\nMusic\nChoir Orchestra\nMIKE PROSSER PUB BOARD CHAIRMAN IC Radio\nSTOIC\nFELIX\nThe Phoenix\nHandbook\nAlternative Prospectus\nJONATHON MILLERS CC CHAIRMAN Societies SDP HG Wells\nUN Soc SF Soc\nAmi-Apartheid\nPATA FFF\nAmnesty ICNAC\nCND Vegsoc\nPimlico Connection\nCatholic\nPolish\nIslam\nChristian\nJewish\nChaplaincyMethodist\nWIST\nIndustrial\nSocialist\nLabour\nConservative\nLiberal\nIAN BULL COLIN BUT TURA CC CHAIRMAN RC C CHAIRMAN Clubs Clubs Bowling Badminton Riding Hamsoc\nVolleyball Squash Chess Billiards\nKarate Tennis Graffltti Mountaineering\nWing Chun Table Tennis Micro Scout and Guide\nSailing Football Model Aircraft Caving\nYacht Hockey- Gliding Surf\nBoat Bridge Balloon\nSwimming & Water Polo Real Ale Dancing\nAngling Cricket Audio Youth Hostelling\nBoardsailing Rugby- Canoe Hang Gliding\nCross Country- Judo Photographic War Games\nSki Fencing Astrosoc\nCycling Rifle\nSporting Motorcycle\nThe Executive\nBecause of size (not to mention the incredible tedium and frequent\nin quo racy!), neither the Union Council, nor the U GM or available to\nformulate Union policy on every point that may arise in the normal\nrunning of IC Union. This task is fulfilled (to a greater or lesser\nextent) by the Union Executive Committee. This committee,\nconsisting of the sabbatical officers (not the FELIX editor) and the\nConstiuent College1\nUnion Presidents meets roughly weekly (or was it\nweakly?) to decide on such points, but when necessary individual\nmembers of the Executive will make decisions without consultation.\nAll members of the Executive are responsible to Union Council and\nthe U GM on matters concerning IC Union (though many C CU matters are dealt with internally).\nUnion Finance\nCommittee\nThis is independent of Council, and holds\nthe purse strings for the Union. Its members\nare elected by aUG M specifically to sit on\nthis committee which allocates grants each\nyear to the various subcommittees and\nOS C CHAIRMAN Societies Pakistan\nAfro-Caribbean\nIndia\nChinese\nCypriot\nHellenic\nIranian\nLatin American\nANDREW SHEPPARD SIL WOOD PARK COM M CHAIRMAN Dr Ken Weale\nICU Hon Senior Treasurer\nCCUs.

    "content": "All it takes is a twist: Michael Caine explains to Christopher\nReeve how to escape from Houdini's handcuffs.\nfor his revenge and finally his grisly end.\nThe story (a cheeky rework of Phantom at\nthe Opera) stands up well as a period piece\nand is hugely enjoyable as such. Price's tones\nare suitably Shakespearian and Phyllis Kirk\nscurries away from the mysterious figure in\nblack with commendable haste, but melodrama\noccasionally degenerates into farce. On the\nwhole the film is a remarkable achievement\u2014\neven more so considering that the director was\nblind in one eye and could never appreciate\nthe 3-D process itself.\nThis process is used well (especially when a street caller advertising the waxworks bats\nelastica ted balls into the audience) and is more\neffective than later efforts such as Parasite or\nDynasty. As it is filmed in 'color' (sorry!) it also\nbeats other 3-D favourites like It Came From\nOuter Space.\nIf you've never seen a3D film, then this is\nthe one to try. But a word of advice. The\nexclusive presentation at ABC Fulham Road\nmeans that seats tend to sell quickly, so book\nin advance (especially at weekends).\nMark Smith\nDeathtrap, featuring Michael Caine and\nChristopher Reeve.\nWhen Ira Levin's stage play Deathtrap was\nfirst produced in the West End it was widely\ncriticised as a blatant attempt to write another\nSleuth: an ingenious thriller with two acts, one\nset, and five characters. The accusation could\nnever be denied, but this was no reason to\nreject the play as worthless, and its\nsubsequent record-breaking run proved this.\nThe film version demonstrates another facet of\nLevin's play which it shares with Sleuth: it\ndoesn't work too well on the big screen.\nThere are several reasons for this. Primarily,\none of the main features of the plot is that\nSidney Bruhl (Michael Caine) is a playwright\nworking on a play called Deathtrap, which is in\ntwo acts, one set, five characters, etc, and as\nthe story unfolds it becomes clear that the play\nhe is writing (within the play) is not only based\non a murder which has taken place in his own\nhouse (ie the play Bruhl is writing is based on\nBruhl's experiences) but at a different 'meta-level' he is writing the Ira Levin play Deathtrap\nin which he is only one of the fictitious\ncharacters. Confused? You won't be in the\nfilm, because this element is partly missing.\nCouldn't it have been rewritten to make Bruhl\na film director?\nAs I mentioned, Deathtrap is a one set play,\nand so when it is staged, every part of Sidney\nBruhl's living room is continuously on view,\nand so the audience becomes obsessed with\nBruhl's impressively displayed collection of\nweaponry, and when characters in turn reach\nfor gun or knife or whatever, there is a definite\nthrill as you realise 'My God, he's actually\ngoing to use that thing.' In the film we are only\ngiven occasional glimpses of the weapons\n(since the camera is naturally focussed on the\nac to 'rs for most of the time) and so the effect is\nconsiderably weakened.\nMy final criticism is that the big surprises\ndon't work, notably one very dramatic entrance which is one of the most effective\nshocks I have experienced in the theatre; in\nthe cinema it just isn't possible to startle an\naudience in the same way merely by the\nentrance of one character; cinema audiences\nare used to so much more.\nOn the credit side, special effects make\nmurder rather more effective than on stage\nthe director has taken the opportunity to wr i( in a chase around the home, and rh i ra\nweak original ending has been completely\nrewritten to allow one final twist Wnn c>ul d never be effectively portrayed on siu ge. More\nthan this cannot '\u2022\u201e. - \u2022 d without revealing\nFELIX \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 BH H HI BB9I details of the plot!\nConclusion? Despite the film's weaknesses,\nthe strength of the plot holds up, and it is\nworth a visit if you missed the play. If, like me,\nyou saw the play, you'll know just what's coming and will find the film something of a letdown.\nMartin S Taylor\nPlague of\nGraffitti\nPlague Dogs; Fast Times\nEver since Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin, man's best\nfriend has often been made the heroic subject\nof a film, but rarely so poignantly as in Plague\nDogs, which has just opened at the Odeon\nHaymarket. Richard Adams has recently fallen\nout with the powers that be at the RSPCA, and\nresigned as President because the hierarchy\nweren't prepared to put a few noses out of\njoint over animal research. This latest\nadaptation of one of his books firmly puts his\ncase.\nAnyone who saw Watership Down will\nrecognise the animation style; Richard Adams\nhas brought together the same team once\nagain, and the result is a very polished style of\nanimation, with the bonus of an all-star cast\nincluding John Hurt and James Bola m providing the voices and the perennial Percy\nEdwards for the sound effects; and we are\nspared Art Garfunkel warbling on the\nsoundtrack.\nOur canine heroes escape from trie mental\nand physical torture of the research establishment and quickly have to come to\nterms with life in the wild, living off livestock,\nattracting the unfriendly attention of the local\nfarmers, until a rumour circulates that the\ndogs may be infected with bubonic plague,\nwhich was the subject of a top secret MoD project at the lab.\nA likeable, affectionate, if rather downbeat\nfilm, which I'm sure' will be enjoyed by those\nwho liked Watership Down, so when your\nunspeakable ten-year-old cousins are dumped\non you this Christmas, there are many worse\nways to keep them quiet for an afternoon. I'd like to think that it would stimulate public\ndebate into animal research and vivisection,\nbut !': is almost too nice for this crusading tag.\nMy other films theme isn't cruelty, unless\nit's cruelty to the reviewer. If it wasn't for the\njolly nice seats in the review cinema and a misplaced sense of duty to you, dear reader,\nHH H BH October 22, 1982 WKBBBBM\nI'd have joined the rush for the door during\nAmy Heckerling's Fast1\nTimes which has just\nopened at the Plaza, Leicester Square.\nThere have been innumerable attempts by\nthe cinema industry to reproduce the success\nof American Graffitti but all have failed for\nvarious reasons. This latest offering is an\nadaptation of a book by Cameron Crowe who\nclaims to have attempted a piece of serious\nsociological research into the modern teenage\nculture by going back to high school 'under\ncover' to observe his subject in its natural\nhabitat (I wonder if anyone spotted him).\nWhat emerges is the usual self-indulgent\n'boy did you ever miss out' view of adolescence.\n'The Kids' are precocious, promiscuous, and\nprovocative while at the same time vulnerable\nand misunderstood. Are all American kids like\nthat? If so I'm glad I spent my formative years\nthis side of the Atlantic.\nWhere the film fails in comparison with \u2022\nAmerican Graffitti is that the characters are\ntoo thin; it fails to concentrate on a small group\nof people, trying instead to explain the many\nmotivations and fantasies of its stereotypes as\nit ridicules and dissects them. The warmth and\nsympathy which worked so well in Graffitti is\nsomehow missing here and the soundtrack is a rather mixed bunch of instantly forgettable\nAmerican rock tunes rather than driving\nrhythms.\nThe X certificate this film has attracted\nbecause of the amount of time devoted to the\nexamination of Jennifer Jason Leigh's rather\nnon-de script figure, must somewhat lessen its\nappeal, since it excludes those most likely to\nidentify with the central characters. But, those\nof you who enjoyed Porkys will pro bci bly lap it\nup.\nLee Paddon\n\n"
