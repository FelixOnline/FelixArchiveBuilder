These\nincreased contributions\nshould, according to the\nreport, be focused on the\ncourses which are most\nexpensive to provide \u2013\nsuch as STEM subjects\n\u2013 and those that offer\n\u201cbetter value\u201d.\nHowever, former\nUniversities Minister, Jo\nJohnson, has expressed\ndoubts over the Treasury\u2019s\nwillingness to increase\nhigher education funding,\nsaying the Augar report\u2019s\nrecommendations will\n\u201cdestabilise university\nfinances, imperil many\ncourses and reverse\nprogress in widening\naccess\u201d. Education Secretary, Damian Hinds,\nhas dismissed claims\nthat the Augar report\u2019s\nrecommendations will put\nuniversities into financial\nhardship as \u201cscaremongering\u201d.\nLoan debt outstanding at financial year end for England // House of Commons Library\nThe proportion of debt repaid by borrowers and the proportion written off by govern-ment, under recent loan systems and the proposed system // Augar report\nTuitioncutsa\u201cshallowgesture\u201dclaimsLabourminister\nAnalysis\nLast year, Imperial College submitted three priorities to theAugar report\u2019s review\npanel. The College said any changes to financing must be sustainable and bridge\nthe gap [estimated at \u00a390 million for Russell Group universities alone] between\nexisting funding for and the actual cost of providing \u201ca world-leading STEM education\u201d, and should ensure higher education is accessible regardless of a student\u2019s\nfinancial circumstances. How far do the Augar report\u2019s recommendations meet\nthese priorities?\nAnalysis by auditing firm KPMG revealed that UK universities spend 42% of\ntheir income on teaching \u2013 considerably less than higher education institutes in\nother countries. Managing estates, student services, and corporate and administrative costs account for 47%. The remaining 10% is used as a \u201cmargin for sustainability and investment\u201d (i.e. money used to protect against future risk and to ensure\nservices and standards can be maintained or improved). This MSI equates to an\naverage of \u00a31,000 per student \u2013 a figure the Augar report describes as \u201csubstantial\u201d.\nThe report also notes that the higher education sector is \u201cin a reasonably solid\nfinancial position\u201d.\nThe specialised equipment required for many STEM subjects means these\ncourses are more costly to provide than many arts- or humanities-based degrees.\nAs a STEM-focused university, Imperial has less opportunity to subsidise more\nexpensive courses with surplus from courses that cost less than \u00a39,250 per student\nper year, as many other universities do. However, Imperial may be able to benefit\ndisproportionately if the government decides to implement the recommendation\nthat funding should be focused on \u201chigh-cost and high-value subjects\u201d as part of\nthe government\u2019s Industrial Strategy, which includes a pledge to increase spending\non research and development from 1.7% to 2.4%. The Augar report states: \u201cOur\nproposals \u2026 are intended to encourage [STEM education] and are likely to result\nin more funding going to institutions with a strong research base.\u201d\nThe reintroduction of maintenance grants, which do not have to be paid back, will\nhelp those less able to cover their living costs but the benefits of the report\u2019s other\nsuggestions \u2013 cutting tuition fees and interest rates while spreading repayments\nover a longer period \u2013 are less certain.\nAs Felix has previously reported, cutting tuition fees primarily benefits the\nhighest-earning graduates. Two in five graduates earn less than \u00a325,000 five years\nafter graduating, meaning they fall below the threshold at which they have to start\nrepaying their student debts, which, on average, amount to over \u00a350,000. Even\nfactoring in the additional ten years before the debts are written off, low-earning\ngraduates are unlikely to see any significant change in the amount they pay back.\nHigher earners, who are already more likely to be able to pay off their debts in full,\nwill pay back a lower total amount. An analysis by The Times estimates that the top\n5% of earners would pay back \u00a337,323 under the Augar report\u2019s recommendations,\ncompared to \u00a355,452 under the current system. Meanwhile, middle-earners on\nsalaries of \u00a330,000-\u00a340,000 \u2013 who currently repay an average of \u00a314,844 \u2013 would\nend up repaying \u00a326,667.\nShadow Education\nMinister, Gordon\nMarsden, has described\nthe proposed cut to tuition\nfees as \u201ca shallow gesture\u201d\nthat \u201cwill not resolve the\nissues that affect prospective students or our\ninstitutions\u201d.\nAddressing the House\nof Commons earlier\nthis week, Hinds said:\n\u201cWhatever decisions we\nmake about how best to\ntake forward recommendations in this report, it's\nvital that we support these\ninstitutions to continue to\noffer world-leading higher\neducation to students in\nfuture.\u201d\n\n"

Speaking\nto Felix, Cambridge\nUniversity graduate\nChris Jammer - the\nfestival co-founder (who\nthe eagle-eyed amongst\nyou may recognise as a\nwinner from E4\u2019s series\nShipwrecked) \u2013 said the\nfestival promises \u201cthe\nexperience of a day\nout\u2026 not too far from\nLondon and it\u2019s just all\nabout positivity and good\nvibes and throwback fun\nreally, while remaining\ncredible and current with\nthe music we\u2019re putting\non\u201d. Felix investigates the\nreasons why Strawberries\n& Creem has become a\nfirm fixture in the summer\nfestival calendar.\nIndependent\nCurated by a small\nteam of just seven young\ncreatives, the one day\nevent stays true to its\nethos: \u201ccelebrate heritage,\nStrawberries & Creem\nco-founder, Chris Jammer\n// Instagram: @ChrisJammer\nMUSIC\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14\nchampion future\u201d. The\nteam consists of a mix\nof Cambridge University\ngraduates, Cambridge\nlocals and Anglia Ruskin\nUniversity graduates.\nChris told Felix: \u201cWe\u2019re\na bunch of 25 year olds\nreally just having fun\nand putting something on\nthat we\u2019d want to go to,\nrather than a big corporation trying to impose\nwhat they feel is needed.\nWe\u2019re just doing this for\neveryone else like us.\u201d As\nsuch, the festival is a real\ncelebration of good vibes\nand the hottest names in\nhouse, rap and R&B, and\ngarage. Although having\nsuch a small team may initially seem like it would\npose a challenge, Chris\nexplained to Felix why\nthis has been a strength\nin running Strawberries\n& Creem: \u201cIn the festival\nindustry, most festivals\nare owned by the same\nsort of people, whereas\nwe are independent so\nwe\u2019re coming in trying to\nprove our brand value and\nour trustworthiness. When\nwe\u2019reworkingwithbrands\nand new people, just\ngetting across the vision\nof what you\u2019re doing and\nactually if you\u2019re capable\nof delivering that sort of\nstuff.\u201d Strawberries &\nCreem always shows true\nsupport for UK music\nand this enthusiasm has\nbeen reciprocated by the\nindustry.\nThe festival continues to go from\nstrength to strength\nOriginally created five\nyears ago as an end of year\ngarden party celebration\nfor the students of Cambridge, Strawberries &\nCreem now successfully\nprovides the city with an\nexciting musical identity\nthat continues to expand\nannually. Detailing the\nfestival\u2019s journey from\njust 1000 guests in its first\nyear to becoming one of\nthe UK\u2019s fastest growing\nevents, Chris explained:\n\u201cIn Cambridge University, they have something\ncalled May Week. When\neveryone finishes exams,\nevery College and association has their own party.\nThe May Balls, especially,\nare quite privileged - they\ncost a lot of money to go\nto, got to dress in black-tie, that sort of thing;\nso we wanted to put an\nalternative in that space,\ndelivering the music we\nwanted to listen to. Just\nchallenge the make up of\nCambridge University\u2019s\nMay Week a little bit. That\nstarted as a garden party\nbut we called it a music\nfestival and it was just\nreally a stage with a few\ntoilets and a burger van.\nFrom there, we\u2019ve gone\nfrom strength to strength.\nLast year we did 10,000,\nthis year we\u2019re going to do\n12,500.\u201d Chris also added\n\u201cThis year, we\u2019ve established ourselves enough\nthat brands are coming to\nus; that\u2019s a good sign of\ngrowth.\u201d\nThe shift in line-up has led to an\u201cinteresting\u201dshift in\ndemographic // Strawberries & Creem\nDiverse Lineup\nWith the 2019 edition\nset to be topped by\nMOBO winner Stefflon\nDon - whose meteoric rise\nhas seen her gain international success with French\nMontana, Tory Lanez,\nJeremih, Sean Paul and\nNe-Yo collaborations \u2013\nthis year\u2019s Strawberries &\nCreem promises a musically diverse line-up.

    "content": "Xenoncouldbeusedtoreducetraumaticbraindamage,\nImperial study finds\nSCIENCE\nS\u00e2nziana Foia\nScience Editor\nT\nraumatic Brain\nInjury (TBI) is\nthe leading cause\nof death and\ndisability for people aged\nunder 45 in developed\ncountries. The first ever\nlife-long study in mice\nhas found that head injury\neffects can be halted by\nxenon gas. Following\nTBI, xenon prevented the\nmice from early deaths,\nimproved their long-term\ncognition, and protected\ntheir brain tissue.\nIn TBI, a primary injury\nis first caused by the initial\nforce from a fall or car\naccident, for example, and\nis followed by a secondary injury which develops\nin the minutes, hours and\ndays afterwards. It is the\nsecondary injury that is\nlargely responsible for\nthe mental and physical\ndisabilities associated\nwith TBI - but there are\ncurrently no specific drug\ntreatments that can be\ngiven after the trauma to\nstop TBI from develop-ing. The only treatment\navailable is supportive\nand rehabilitative. TBI\npatients who survive the\ninjury have a reduced life\nexpectancy and an in-Imperial College London\nand Johannes Gutenberg\nUniversity Mainz have\nfound that the anaesthetic\ndrug xenon, given shortly\nafter a TBI, prevents\nearly death and long-term\ncognitive impairment and\neven protects the brain\ntissue itself in mice. The\nxenon-treated mice had\nsimilar life expectancy,\ncognitive function, and\nbrain tissue integrity to\nmice that had never sustained a TBI.\nPreviously, the same\nteam led by Dr Robert\nDickinson and colleagues\nat Imperial\u2019s Department\nof Surgery and Cancer,\nshowed that xenon limited\nearly brain damage and\nimproved long-term\nmotor function in mice\nwith TBI, but longer term\neffects were not yet inves-tigated. Now for the first\ntime, the effects of xenon\nover the whole lifespan of\nmice has been observed,\nin this study that was\npublished in the British\nJournal of Anaesthesia.\nAnimals were\nrandomly allocated to\none of three groups: TBI\nxenon, TBI control, and\nhealthy control. Under\ngeneral anaesthesia and\nlong-acting pain relief,\na controlled mechanical\nforce was applied to the\nbrains of the TBI control\nand TBI xenon groups.\nThe healthy control group\nwas given anaesthesia, but\ndid not receive a TBI. The\nresearchers gave xenon\ngas to one of these groups\n(TBI xenon group), while\nthe other two received\ncontrol gas for the same\ndamage. Xenon treatment\nshortly after TBI appeared\nto prevent this. The TBI\ncontrol group were also\nobserved to have damage\nin key brain areas involved\nin cognitive functioning.\nXenon-treatment prevented or significantly reduced\nthis damage.\nXenon prevented the\nloss of brain cells in the\nhippocampus (an area of\nthe brain associated with\nlearning and memory),\nand prevented degeneration of nerve fibres in the\ncorpus callosum (which\nconnects the two brain\nhemispheres). Xenon\nwas also shown to reduce\nlong-term brain inflammation that is believed to\nbe involved in cognitive\nimpairment in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and other\ndementias.\nAccording to the\ngroup, these findings\nare important as they\ncould offer insight into\nnew treatments for TBI\npatients, who currently do\nnot have any specific drug\ntreatments available.\nLead author of the\nstudy, Dr Rita Campos-Pires, from the\nDepartment of Surgery\n& Cancer, said, \u201cThere\nis currently a huge gap\nin what treatment we can\noffer to patients who\u2019ve\nsuffered TBI - an injury\nwhich can impact all areas\nof their lives. Although\nxenon has not yet been\ntested for TBI in humans,\nour findings add to the\ngrowing body of evidence\nthat suggests it could be\nused after head injuries to\nprevent secondary injury\ndeveloping.\n\u201cXenon appears to act\nin a variety of ways, but\none of the most likely\nmechanisms to explain its\nprotective effects on brain\ntissue is by inhibiting receptors in the brain known\nas NMDA receptors, that\nbecome over-activated\nfollowing a brain injury.\u201d\nDr Dickinson added:\n\u201cWe have looked at very\nlong-term outcomes, up\nto 20 months after TBI in\nmice. This is very rarely\ndone in animal studies and\nis equivalent to following\nup human TBI patients\nuntil their 80s. The\nfinding that only a short\ntreatment with xenon can\nhave beneficial effects on\ncognition, survival, and\nbrain damage almost two\nyears later suggests that\nxenon might in future\nprevent cognitive decline\nand improve survival in\nhuman TBI patients.\u201d\nXenon is already used\nas a human general anaes-thetic, is known to have\nfew side effects and could\nbe easily given via inhalation or to mechanically\nventilated TBI patients in\nthe intensive care unit.\nGiven xenon\u2019s safety\nSCIENCE\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\n\u201cKey brain\nareas involved\nin cognitive\nfunctioning\nwere damaged\nin the control\nTBI group.\nXenon\ntreatment\nprevented or\nsignificantly\nreduced this\ndamage.\u201d\nThe area of corpus callosum was significantly reduced in the TBI control group, but\nthe xenon-treated group was not significantly different to the uninjured healthy control group // Robert Dickinson\n\u201cThere is\ncurrently a\nhuge gap\nin what\ntreatment we\ncan offer to\npatients who\nsuffered TBI\u201d\n\u201cTBI patients\nwho survive\nthe injury have\na reduced life\nexpectancy\nand an\nincreased risk\nof developing\nAlzheimer\u2019s\u201d\ncreased risk of developing\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease or\nother dementias later in\nlife.\nNow, researchers from\namount of time.\nAll three groups then\nunderwent learning and\nmemory tests at two\nweeks and 20 months\nafter the injury.

    "content": "Flying regularly not crucial for success in academia\nS\ncience is quite\nrightly celebrated\nfor being an international enterprise,\nand academics often feel\nrequired or obliged to\nfly frequently and over\nlong-distances in order\nto conduct their work or\nmaintain professional\nrelationships. But how\nimportant is long-distance\ntravel to a scientific\ncareer, and how much do\nscientists contribute to\nclimate change through\ntheir travels?\n30% of academics\nwho surveyed by the\nTyndall Centre felt an\nexpectation to fly from\ntheir university. A new\nstudy at the University of\nBritish Colombia (UBC)\nsuggests this pressure may\nnot be rationally founded.\nAlthough academics who\nchange affiliation are\nfound to have 40% more\ncitations, academics who\nfly more frequently do\nnot have a greater number\nof citations, nor do they\nhave a greater number of\nco-authors per paper.\nAttending conferences,\nundertaking fieldwork\nand teaching all contribute to the demand for\ntravel by air, with 60%\nof demand coming from\ntravel for conferences.\nIn a sample of 705 academics at UBC, claims\nfor air travel were made\nfor 2.9 trips per person\neach year on average.\nOf these, 10% of trips\nwere same-day returns,\nlong-distance flights with\nonly one overnight stay,\nor short-distance flights\nfor which ground-based\ntransport could be taken.\nSuch trips have a high\ncarbon footprint within a\nshort timeframe.\nThe scientific consensus on climate change\nis clear, and so are\nthe impacts of flying.\nAviation is the most environmentally damaging\nform of long-distance\ntransportation. A single\npassenger travelling 100\nkm by plane is responsible\nfor the production of over\n20 kg CO2\ne in emissions,\ndouble that by road (10\nkg) and seven times that\nof a passenger travelling\nby rail (3 kg) (see To\nthe planet every journey\nmatters below). This is\ndespite the high seating\nefficiency of airlines\nthanks pre-booking\nsystems, less rigorously\nimposed in rail and bus\ntravel, and decades of\noptimization of aircraft\ndesign and operation.\nEmissions from aircraft\nalso affect human health\ndirectly. For instance,\nemissions from aircraft\nincrease near-surface\nozone levels and atmospheric sulphate concentra-tions. While Ozone in the\nupper atmosphere blocks\nharmful UV frequencies,\nat the surface it results\nin respiratory diseases.\nSulphate aerosols, though\nslightly reducing the\ngreenhouse effect, have\nthe potential to cause\ndrought according to a\nbriefing paper produced\nby the Grantham Institute\nat Imperial College.\nUsing, for the first time,\nwritten records (travel\nexpenses) as opposed to\nself-reported statistics,\nwhich can suffer from\nlimitations, researchers\nfound no correlation in\nthe sample between the\nh-index of academics\nand the distance flown,\neven when accounting for\nage of the academic and\nnumber of co-authors on\neach paper. Nor was there\na correlation between\nnumber of citations per\nauthor per paper and\ndistance.\nPerhaps flying helps\nto produce larger collab-orations? This too also\ndoes not appear to be the\ncase, the average number\nof co-authors per paper\nwas no higher for academics who flew further.\nA significant correlation\nfound was between\nemissions and salary. An\npossible explanation is\nthat higher-earning senior\nresearchers are frequently\ninvited to give talks and\nmore likely to afford to fly\nin higher class.\nActing to reduce air\ntravel can come with\neconomic and social\nco-benefits, including\nbetter perception of the\nscientific community.\nAlthough academics\nare aware and often\nsympathetic to environmental issues, they are\nSUSTAINABILITY\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 7TH\nJUNE, 2019 FELIX\nartur.donaldson15@imperial.ac.uk\nArtur Donaldson\nSustainability Editor\nsometimes criticised for\nthe knowledge-action gap\non flight. A ten-year study\nof newspapers in four different countries, including\nthe UK, found that a third\nof criticisms levelled at\nacademics mentioned\ntheir flying behaviour.\nChanges need not be\ncostly. The lowest hanging\nfruit is to travel modestly.\nEconomy class passengers\ncause almost three times\nlower emissions than\nbusiness class, and four\ntimes lower than first class\npassengers. Encoding\ncommittments to use the\nlowest carbon means of\ntransportation into grants\ncould be an effective and\neasy strategy and set an\nexample. Restrictions on\nclass of seating is already\nincluded in some grants.\nGiven that reducing\nflying is desirable both for\nthe environment and for\nacademics, the results of\nthe research are welcome,\nespecially since Green\nacademics were found\nto be no less likely to fly\nthan non-Green.\nAir travel may not be\ntotally elimintated. Some\nlong-distance travel will\nbe needed for instance for\nfieldwork. One should\nbe cautious to limit opportunities for less secure\nresearchers who already\ntravel less. Academics\nwho did not claim any\nair travel expenses were\nfound to receive fewer ci-tations. A limited amount\nof air travel, used effec-tiely, may be beneficial.\nAbove a certain threshold\nit is a case of diminishing\nreturns.\nA cultural shift is\nneeded, but the changes\nrequired already have\na precedent. Awarding\ngrants which encourage low carbon travel,\nvideo-conferencing and\nlimit use of high class air\ntravel are strategies which\ncould be employed to help\nresearchers give flight to\ntheir research without liberating greenhouse gases.\nTo the planet every journey matters\nMore fulfilling than jetting off in search of Love Island ...\n60% of flights were to attend conferences // Wikimedia\nNew study finds increased travel does not increase impact of research\n16\nNow available online\nhttp://felixonline.co.uk/categories/sustainability/\n\n"

It\nis easily the most remote\ncampus, but also the most\nbeautiful (suck it SK). I\nlike to call it Imperial\u2019s\ngreen cupboard. This is\nbecause, for me, it really\ndoes seem like Silwood\nis the Harry Potter under\nthe stairs in the Imperial\nhousehold \u2013 most of you\ndon\u2019t know or care that\nwe\u2019re here. We\u2019re not\nbitter in the slightest,\nhonest!\nThere are only a couple\nof downsides to living\nout here in the wilderness\n\u2013 like the fact that South\nKen controls our heating,\nor that very few of the\nservices provided for the\nLondon campuses make\nit all the way out here.\nHowever, despite the very\nfew downsides, life is\npretty great in the forest.\nBelow are some of what\nI consider to be highlights\nof our idyllic lifestyle.\nask someone for help and\nthey will be nice enough\nto give it to me!\nSilwood park is pretty\nnotorious in the ecological\ncommunity, and as such\nwe have guest speakers on\na regular basis to enrich\nour university experi-ence. Once a month the\npostdocs and PhDs host\na social seminar, where\nthey present their research\nover pizza and drinks.\nThe size of the campus\nmeans that, not only is\nthe student community\nclose-knit, but we are\non very good terms with\nmany of the academics on\ncampus, which promotes\na really relaxed but driven\nlearning environment.\nMost universities, I\nfind, have a clear divide\nbetween the students and\nthe academics. Here, the\nlines are less definite \u2013 we\nare all here to learn.\nI feel very privileged\nto live here. There are\nvery few places where\nyou could get such a\nwholesome and fulfilling\nuniversity experience.\nThe pace of life is very different to London but that\u2019s\nhonestly a good thing in\nmy opinion, there\u2019s time\nto focus on what\u2019s impor-tant. If you want to come\ncheck out the campus for\nyourself, we are hosting\na fully-fledged festival\non the 3rd\nof August! You\ncan find details here: bit.\nly/Silfest19.\nPlease don\u2019t forget\nabout us xx\nI\nwould like to\nnominate Professor\nDominik Weiss from\nthe Earth Science and\nEngineering department\nfor the best supervision\naward. He is just a great\nguy and I am lucky to\nhave him as my supervi-sor! I am coming towards\nthe end of my PhD and\nI couldn\u2019t have done it\nwithout him.\nDominik has always\nbeen there to support me\nthroughout my PhD. He\nprovides just the right\namount of advice to push\nme in the right direction\nwithout taking over or\npreventing me from\nlearning new things. He\nis extremely open to collaborating with different\npeople from all over the\nworld, by both suggesting\npeople to collaborate\nwith, and by allowing us\nto find our own collabo-rators. For example, he\nhas helped me to collaborate with Gaussian, a\ncompany which develops\nthe software I use for my\ncomputational chemistry\ncalculations. My research\nwas supposed to focus on\nexperimental methods,\nbut because I was interested in computational\nchemistry, he actively\nencouraged me to develop\nmy skills in this area. He\nwent outside his comfort\nzone to learn this discipline with me, and how to\napply it to environmental\nproblems. This is a trait\nof all great researchers\nand supervisors. He has\nnow incorporated the\ndiscipline into other PhD\nstudent projects.\nHe encourages all his\nstudents to explore areas\noutside of academia. He\nregularly tells us about internships he comes across\nwhich he thinks we will\nfind interesting. I ended\nup doing a 6 month internship at the Department\nfor Business, Energy and\nIndustrial Strategy which\nprovided useful insights to\nlife outside of academia.\nHe supported me when it\nlooked like there would\nbe funding issues, and did\neverything in his power to\nmake sure I could do it.\nThe most important\nthing though is that he\nalways puts us first before\nthe research. He always\nwants us to have a good\nwork-life balance. This\ncan often be forgotten\nby PhD students like me\nwho get absorbed in their\nresearch! His door is open\nregardless of whether you\nwant to discuss research\nor a personal issue.\nUltimately, he is no\nlonger a supervisor, but a\nlifelong friend.\u201d\nWhat Best Supervision\nmeant to Imperial College\nPG Students this year?\n\u201cCongratulations from\nall the PG\ncommunity!\u201d\nThe Union\u2019s promises\ntowards PG are good.\nSticking to these promises\nwould be better.\nPOSTGRADUATE\nUte Thiermann\nGSU President\nI\nn the beginning of\nmy period as GSU\nPresident, I had frequent meetings with\nthe Union\u2019s Managing\nDirector, Jarlath O\u2019Hara,\nand some of the Officer\nTrustees, particularly\nRob Tomkies [Union\nPresident] and Alejandro\nLuy [Deputy President\n(Education)]. Damn, we\nhad really good plans! For\nthe first time, we would\ntry to work together and\norchestrate our efforts to\nwork towards the needs\nof PG students. Maybe\nfor the first time in many\nyears, Union representatives have not only\nadmitted that PG students\nare largely neglected by\nthe Union, they went even\nfurther and promised that\nthey would support us\n(the GSU) in our activities\nand strategies. The goal\nwas that the Union should\nwork with the GSU as\ntheir executive arm to\naddress PG needs. Direct\nkey contacts were identified for every GSU officer,\nas well as sub-committees\nset up to work together\nmore effectively. We\nagreed on a timeline of actions and events, and the\nPG Black Tie Ball would\nbe our highlight project\nto trial and optimise our\ncooperation. While the\nfirst few months were\nquite successful, with a\nfull review of our GSU\ngovernance structure, the\nUnion\u2019s efforts to hold\ntheir promises have drastically declined over the\nlast 6 months. On paper,\nour sub-committees\nlooked great, but words\nneed to be put into action\nto turn into reality.\nThe most disappointing\nexperience was the Union\nmanagement\u2019s attitude\nregarding the PG Black\nTie Ball. During the\none (and only) meeting\nin 2019 concerning the\nball, the officers and the\nHead of Student Voice\n& Communication reaffirmed their promises to\nturn the Black-Tie ball\ninto a flagship event for\nPG students. Help with\nthe marketing campaign\nand the organisation of\nthe event and financial\nadministration were all\npledged. For the GSU,\nthis was the first Ball; for\nthe Union, one of many.\nCounting on the\nUnion\u2019s support, we\naimed big and put plans\nin place to make the event\nhappen. Unfortunately, we\nwere left feeling under-whelmed by the support\nwe were given. The\npromises that were made,\nfor support with organisation and advertising,\nwere left unfulfilled, with\nnobody from the Union\neven being involved. The\nCommunications team\ndeclined to help with\nadvertising until all the\ntickets for the Summer\nBall, scheduled to happen\nthree weeks after the\nPostgraduate event and\nmainly aimed at attracting\nUndergraduates, were\nsold. This, combined with\npoor advice from elected\nOfficers, has meant the\nflagship postgraduate\nevent, which had such\npromise, almost failed\nto happen. Despite this\nseeming abandonment\nfrom the Union, our GSU\ncommittee has managed\nto pull together as a team\nto provide what looks to\nbe a fantastic event. Most\ntickets have now been\nsold and we can be proud\nthat, for the first time, we\nare bringing PG students\nfrom every campus and\nfaculty together as one\nImperial Postgraduate\ncommunity.\nThe people at the Union\ndid have good intentions,\nand there has been help\nalong the way that has\nbeen welcomed. What\nmay have been underestimated is that for a change\nin long-lasting traditions,\nwe need to fundamentally\nchange the way we work.\nWe need extra care, effort\nand allocation of resources to engage a community\nthat has different needs\nto the Undergraduate\npopulation. We hope that,\nin the next academic year,\nthe freshly elected Union\nofficers will turn those\npromises into actions.\nLuckily, we have our PG\nrepresentative Ashley\nBrooks starting as Deputy\nPresident (Education), so\nour hopes are up!\nPOSTGRADUATE\nUte Thiermann\nGSU President\n\u201cAs a supervisor,\nDominik is so generous\nwith his time. He always\nfinds a way to fit in a\nmeeting to discuss a\nproblem you may be\nhaving with research or\nto write a letter of recommendation for a grant\nyou might have applied\nfor. Equally, if he needs\nto set aside a whole day/\nweek to come down to\nthe lab and help you, he\nwill. He is always prompt\nat marking reports and\ngiving feedback on drafts\nof papers. Even when he\nis out of the country on a\nvisit to another institution\nor on a well-earned break,\nhe will still be contactable.\nHe also recognises where\na problem is beyond his\nfield of expertise and will\nintroduce us to another\nacademic at the college or\nbeyondwhoisbettersuited\nto help (I am currently on\na 9-week research trip at\nthe University of Valencia,\nlearning a new electrochemical technique).\nBeyond purely\nacademic supervision,\nDominik is a genuinely\nkind person who always\nlooks to see the best in the\nsituation - for example,\neven when our lab\nflooded, he was able to\nsee the brighter side and\njoked about the opportunity it presented to give it\na good clean. He takes an\ninterest in the lives of his\ndoctoral students outside\nof the college and is a\npleasure to share a coffee\nwith (and he always buys\nthe coffees).\u201d\nalways happy to see you\n(esp. if you have food).\nYour problems are\nAnd ducks! The ducks\nare my personal faves, I\ncould watch them waddle\naround all-damn-day. Our\nfeathered friends provide\nus with all the animal\ninteraction and fresh free-range eggs a person could\nneed.

These\nare terms used to describe\ndistant news items.\nFentanyl and oxycodone\nwere intangible prob-lems. However, studies\nby the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation\nand Development\n(OECD) show that while\nUK opioid use is still\nbelow that of the US, in\ndaily doses per million\nof population, between\n2013 and 2016 Britons\nincreased their opioid\nconsumption more than\nthe citizens of any other\ncountry surveyed, excepting those from Israel\nor Slovakia. The effect\nof this has been around\n2000 fatalities attributed\nto opioid painkillers every\nyear, an increase of 41%\nover the last decade.\nThese lethal pills are\nnot bought through the\nblack market, at least\nnot initially. Instead they\nare prescribed, usually\nby GPs, to non-surgical\npatients who turn to other\nmeans to acquire the\ndrugs that they depend\non once their prescription\nruns out. A look across\nthe Atlantic reveals the\npotential consequences\nof our current behaviour.\nIn the US more than 130\npeople die every day from\nopioid overdoses, largely\nthe consequence of overzealous prescription in the\n1990s.\nThere is no quick-fix\nsolution. Addicts are\nmaligned as junkies\nlooking to secure their\nnext hit of temporary\nbliss. The reality is that\npainkiller addicts trying\nto live normal lives must\nturn to dealers for the pills\nthey depend on for transient relief. Tragically,\noveruse of prescription\nopioids can cause a\ncondition called hyperal-gesia, a form of chronic\npain. Long-term opioid\nusers can find themselves\nlocked in a cycle of agony\nfrom which the only relief\nis ever larger doses. In\ntrying to provide relief\ndoctors have only exacerbated the problem.\nAny response to this\ngrowing crisis must\nbe motivated first and\nforemost by compassion.\nNeither a tough response\nthat promises to punish\npeople for what has\nbefallen them nor the\nhand-wringing displayed\nby Dave Thompson,\nChief Constable of West\nMidlands Police, who\nrefuses to follow the law\non cannabis farms for fear\nof harming people\u2019s \u201clife\nchances\u201d, will help these\nvictims.\nInstead the UK should\ntake a two-pronged\napproach. Firstly, GP\nappointments must be\nlengthened to enable GPs\nto address the root causes\nof patients\u2019 pain rather\nthan resorting to prescribing opioids as a catch-all.\nPharmacists should also\nonly sell the exact number\nof pills required by the\nprescription, to avoid\ndependency or pills being\nsold.\nSecondly, the Home\nOffice should support\nGlasgow and other cities,\nwith their plan to open\n\u2018shooting galleries\u2019 to\nhelp those whose lives\nhave been destroyed by\nopioids, by passing the\nnecessary legal amend-ments. Shooting galleries\nwould provide safe places\nfor drug users to inject or\ningest their own drugs,\nin regulated dosages,\nwith medical staff in\nattendance. In Portugal\nthese measures have\nsuccessfully curbed fatal\noverdoses, the spread\nof HIV and hepatitis C.\nThe government should\nbe brave enough to\nbreak with the previous\nmorally bankrupt policy\nand embrace data driven\nmethods to avert an\nepidemic of addiction and\nbroken lives..\n\n"

Our\naward winning Women\u2019s\nCaptain, Charlotte Barratt,\nand the Athletics Captain,\nJack Mitchell, also took\npart, throwing 6.38m and\n6.72m, respectively. Jack\nwent on to take part in\nthe Long Jump, where he\nregistered 4.74m. In the\nsame event, James Weller\ncame third, jumping an\nimpressive 5.32m\nOur brave warriors\ndominated Men\u2019s Javelin,\nas Arthur Jurgenson\nwon the event, followed\n\u201cYou guessed\nit, it\u2019s the\nsteeplechase!\u201d\nFast start in the Men\u2019s 1500m // Geoff Lowe\nclosely by Greg Jones,\nwho came second,\nmaking people wonder if\nAeronautical Engineering\nstudents have an unfair\nadvantage in this event.\nWhile Olivia Papaioannou\ncame within a few inches\nfrom winning the event,\nshe kept fighting throughout the day in three other\ntrack events.\nOne of the club\u2019s\nliving legends, Raul\nRinken, won the Discus,\nthrowing an impressive\n39.6m, while Nnaemeka\nAnyamele threw 30.15m\nto come fourth. Marta\nVan Ginkel and Maryna\nVoloshyna also took part,\nthrowing 17.57m and\n16.55m respectively.\nMoving on to track, it\nhas to be said, Imperial\ncaused quite a lot of\ndamage. In the 100m\nsprint, Will Fisher won his\nheat by running 12.03s.\nHe also did the 200m in\nan impressive time of\n24.70s. Alex Mundell\nabsolutely crushed the\n400m sprint, leaving her\nopponents four whole\nseconds behind and finishing the race in 61.41s.\nThis race left a few people\nconfused, as they taught\nshe was running by\nherself. Alex also claimed\nthird place in the 200m,\nrunning an impressive\n28.27s, reminding the\nother London universities that she\u2019s \u201ctiny but\nmighty\u201d. The day saw\nNiki Faulkner take on\nthe 400m race as well,\nrunning in heat 1 with\nmostly 100% fast-twitch\nmuscle fibre boys that\nprobably spend too much\ntime in the gym. He did\nnot disappoint, finishing\nthe race in 53.38s, a time\nthat makes any so-called\n\u201csprinter\u201d pretty damn\njealous.\nOne of the most\nexciting events was Men\u2019s\n800m, which saw James\nMillett tactically win by\na few inches. James let\nhis UCL opponent dictate\nthe pace throughout the\nrace, only to bite in the\nlast 20m, just like an oily\nsnake. Millett took home\nthe gold medal for the\nathletics championship\nand also won the 1500m\ngold medal, ranking\nhim third in the LUCA\nOutdoors MVP standing.\nThese two events made us\nrealise James has got quite\nan extraordinary fan base\namong UCL students,\nas most of them where\nshouting \u201cGo, Hugo!\nGo!\u201d; very personal too,\nas they knew his middle\nname. Thomas Bayley\nand Fergus Johnson also\ntook part in this race,\nclocking 4:14 and 4:42\nrespectively.\nThe 5000m saw a few\nImperial athletes running\ntwelve and a half laps in\nthe scorching sun. Female\nAthlete of the Year,\nGeorgia Curry, claimed\ngold after finishing the\nrace in 17 minutes and\n59 seconds; dabs were\nincluded. Alix Vermeulen\ncame second with a time\nof 19:07 and Nina Rimsky\nfinished in 23:44. The\nboys put up a good fight in\nthe heath as well, with Joe\nPomfret finishing fourth\nin 17 minutes and 22\nseconds, followed closely\nby Mihaly Ormay, Matt\nRyan, Jim Warren and\nJack Teh. Yes, Matt, we\nknow! You beat Jim.\nwho finished the race in\n11:02. The Club Captain,\nFergus Johnson, also\nmanaged to clock an\nadmirable time of 12:07,\nwhile veteran Lawrence\nKar Tse finished the race\nin 14:37. The girls did\nnot disappoint either. In\nthe 2000m steeplechase,\nChloe Baker came first,\nwith an impressive time of\n7 minutes and 43 seconds,\nplacing her third in the\nleague. She was followed\nby Alix Vermeulen, Olivia\nPapaioannou, Maryna Voloshyna and Marie Jones.\nAs the day came to an\nend, it was time for the\nrace of all races, the one\nto decide all rivalries,\nthe Medley Relay. Each\nuniversity put up a team\nof three men and three\nwomen to run with a\nbaton distances of 200m,\n400m and 800m. This is\nthe time to take out the big\nguns. As the race went on,\nstudents from every university were cheering and\nshouting their runners\u2019\nnames at all times, until\none moment\u2026 The race\nwas very close, UCL and\nKing\u2019s were leading for\nmost of the first four legs.\nJames Millett managed to\ncome par with them at the\nend of his leg, and then it\nhappened. Alex Mundell\ngot the baton and started\nsprinting the first 200m\njust like in her previous\nrace. Students from the\nother universities thought\nshe wouldn\u2019t be able\nto keep it up, but they\ncould have not been more\nwrong; not when you have\nan 800m specialist doing\nit. The UCL and King\u2019s\ncrowds went silent as\nAlex kept increasing the\ngap between her and her\nopponent. Having put in\nthis amazing performance,\nImperial College retained\ntheir Medley Relay trophy\nfor a second year in a row.\nSome people claimed that\nit was not fair, because the\n800m legs were a lot more\nimportant than the shorter\nones and it gave Imperial\nan unfair advantage. To\nthose people, I have two\nstatements: \u201cGold is\ngold!\u201d and \u201cGet better at\nrunning!\u201d.\nThat\u2019s all folks! This\nuniversity athletics\nseason saw Imperial\nCollege rank third overall,\nabove King\u2019s, last year\u2019s\nchampions. The Medley\nRelay trophy and the\nmedals made our athletes\npretty happy at the end\nof the day, some say too\nhappy\u2026 and maybe that\ntrophy should get cleaned\nbefore handing it over,\nprobably with bleach.\nImperial jump well in the Women\u2019s 2km Steeplechase // Geoff Lowe\nMoving on to some\nwater jump naughtiness...\nyaas. You guessed it, it\u2019s\nthe steeplechase! Our orienteering pioneer, Mihaly\nOrmay, stormed the race,\ncoming third with a time\nof 10:58. He was followed\nby Charlie McFadzean,\n\n"

This shouldn\u2019t\nbe a controversial state-ment, yet when Theresa\nMay briefly broke down\nher veneer of stone-cold\nemotionlessness, the press\nimmediately jumped onto\nit, making it headline\nnews in the newspapers\nand spending hours upon\nend holding debates and\ndiscussing whether or not\nwe should feel sorry for\nher.\nThis is symptomatic of\nmedia that treats politics\nlike a pantomime, played\non the grand stage of\nWestminster and detached\nfrom the real world. It is\nsymptomatic of media\nthat doesn\u2019t truly hold our\npoliticians accountable\nand doesn\u2019t understand the\nhuman cost of the policies\nimplemented by them.\nBefore we even begin to\nwonder if we should feel\nsorry for a Prime Minister\nwho was pushed around\nby a bunch of opportunist\ndisaster capitalists from\nher backbenches, let\u2019s\nexamine her record first.\nBefore stepping into\nDowning Street, May was\nthe Home Secretary under\nDavid Cameron. As Home\nSecretary, she oversaw\nthe \u2018hostile environment\u2019\npolicies that put migrants\nat risk, culminating in the\ndeportation and denial\nof healthcare of lawful\ncitizens of the Windrush\ngeneration. For this, the\nnew Home Secretary\nAmber Rudd got sacked,\nwhile May continued her\npremiership in Downing\nStreet. This was without\na doubt an example of\nsystemic racism: policies\nthat disproportionately\nimpact people of a certain\nethnicity negatively; in\nthis case, lawfully settled\nblack Britons.\nShe also pushed\nforward the Snoopers\u2019\nCharter, a large expansion\nof investigatory powers\nthat, had it passed, would\nallow the state to further\nviolate individual privacy.\nThis was *after* the mass\nNSA/GCHQ surveillance\nrevealed by Edward\nSnowden.\nWhile in government,\nand as head of it, she\noversaw a rise in homelessness and in children\nliving in temporary\naccommodation, with a\nUN special rapporteur denouncing the government\nfor the scale of poverty in\nthe UK. She oversaw the\ngradual privatisation of\nthe NHS by contracting\nservices out to private\ncompanies, creating a\ndecline in healthcare\nstandards as well as an\nincrease in waiting times.\nShe oversaw the cuts to\ndisability benefits that\nsubsequently led the\nEquality and Human\nRights Commission to\nstate that one in five\ndisabled people have their\nhuman rights violated.\nMost shamefully of all,\nthe hard-right austerity\nagenda enacted by her\ngovernment has been\nlinked to 120,000 preventable deaths in a landmark\nUCL study.\nThis is without mentioning her government\u2019s\ninaction on climate\nchange, which included\ngoing back on a promise\nto her Maidenhead constituents by passing a third\nHeathrow runway bill. It\nis without mentioning the\ncontinuation of immoral\nBritish foreign policy\nby arming Saudi Arabia,\nwhich is waging war in\nYemen, and Israel, which\nis committing grave\nhuman rights violations\nin Palestine. It is without\nmentioning the sheer\nincompetence displayed\nby her and her chosen\nBrexit Ministers (David\ndisaster? Why did she feel\nmore upset about being\nforced to resign from the\nmost powerful job in the\ncountry, than she did about\nthe human consequences\nof her policies? Theresa\nMay will no doubt live a\ncomfortable and indulgent\nlife until the very end, but\nthe same cannot be said for\nher victims, who are either\ndead or still suffering.\nTheresa May wasn\u2019t an\nespecially evil or immoral\nperson compared to those\nleaders who preceded her\nand those who will come\nafter, but, like any other\nindividual, she has always\nhad a choice.\nTo sum up: can we\nfeel sorry for Theresa\nMay? I\u2019ll let her record\nspeak for itself.\nMaybot_Do_Emotion// Guardian\n\u201cCan we feel\nsorry for\nTheresa May?\nI\u2019ll let her\nrecord speak\nfor itself\u201d\nDavis and Dominic Raab)\nin the negotiations with\nthe EU and with her own\nparty, and the disenfranchisement of the millions\nof EU citizens living in\nthe UK.\nSo, I ask: where was\nthis emotion during the\ngovernment\u2019s disgraceful\nresponse to the Grenfell\n\n"

From\npublishers announcing\nthe next set of DLC as a\nmeans of breathing life\ninto their existing fran-chises, revealing new IPs,\nand giving fuel to the fans\nfor their console wars,\none could say E3 2019\nlasts weeks, with many\nannouncements for major\nseries having already been\nmade this week and more\nto be released next week.\nEA\nConference Date:\nSaturday 8th June.\nTime: 5:15 PM BST.\nViewing Platforms:\nYouTube and Twitch\nFor the EA Play lives-tream, EA has sent a\nbreakdown of their broadcast to TechRadar:\n9:15am: Countdown to\nEA PLAY\n9:30am: Star Wars Jedi:\nFallen Order (Hosted by\nGreg Miller and Andrea\nRene)\n10:00am: Apex Legends\n(Hosted by Alex \u201cGoldenboy\u201d Mendez)\n10:30am: Battlefield\u2122 V\n(Hosted by Julia Hardy\nand Adam Freeman (EA))\n11:00am: FIFA20 (Hosted\nby Alex \u201cGoldenboy\u201d\nMendez)\n11:30am: Madden NFL\n20 (Hosted by Adam\nRank)\n12:00pm: The Sims 4\n(Hosted by Andrea Rene)\nMicrosoft\nConference Date: Sunday\n9th June.\nTime: 9:00 PM BST.\nViewing Platforms:\nXbox One, Mixer.com,\nYouTube, Twitch\nWith the absence\nof Sony at E3, but the\ninternet rife with rumours\nof the PlayStation 5, the\nXbox E3 Briefing would\nbe the best opportunity\nfor Microsoft to make\nwaves this month with the\nannouncement of the next\ngeneration of the Xbox,\ncurrently codenamed\nProject Scarlett. Industry\ninsiders have suggested\nthat if Microsoft does do\nan official annoucement\nfor their next gen console,\nthen there will be successors to both the Xbox One\nX and the Xbox One S.\nMost likely though,\nit will be the Project\nxCloud which will be the\nhardware focus of this\nconference, as an answer\nto Playstation Now and\nthe recently announced\nGoogle Stadia.\nIn terms of video game\ntitles, we can expect more\ninformation and official\nannoucements for Halo\nInfinite, Gears 5 and a\nnew Forza title.\nBethesda\nConference Date:\nMonday 10th June.\nTime: 1.30 AM BST\nViewing Platforms:\nTwitch, YouTube, Twitter,\nMixer and Facebook\nA recent statement\nfrom Todd Howard has\nindicated that we will\nnot be seeing Bethesda\u2019s\nnew sci-fi IP, Starfield,\nnor Elder Scrolls VI at E3\nthis year.
