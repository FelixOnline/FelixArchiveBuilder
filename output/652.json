    "content": "By\nJuvenal\nA torrid talc of terrible torment.\nAny resemblance to persons living\nor dead is purely coincidental.\n\"Argh,\" shrieked Gormless Lay-on,\nPresident of the Citizen's Association as\nshe idly perused a tattered copy of Falix,\nthe local newspaper. \"Gadzooks, boy o, this is verily a scandal um magna tum of\nthe most op pro bio us kind on the Baron,\nor I'm not a Welsh virgin.\"\n\"I refrain from making an obvious\ncomment,\" sneered her assistant the\nwicked bitch, whoops, witch of Southside.\n''Hon de to i tarsi yes you rector speech in den tun ten boring as ever.\" Sawn-off\nLevis spoke for the first time that\ndesolate day. No-one could understand\nhim, however.\n\"But what would the Baron do if he\nread this?\" shrilled Gormless.\n\"He wouldn't know dear, he'd have to\nask John Secretary first.\" Mrs Jolly\nHockey-Sticks was usually right about\nsuch things.\n\"I must do something about this\ndespicable publication, I could steal all\nthe copies. It's been done before you\nknow...\" Lay-On's face, boyish, wan,\npusillanimous, brightened as she strode\noff flat-footed and flat-chested for a glass\nof sherry.\nMeanwhile, high in an ivory tower in a toast-coloured room once used for the\npurposes of academic education, Eric\nProfessor, Master of the Baron's Musick, was racking his brain for\nsomething to do with a few thousand\ngold pieces given him by the Baron for\nthe advancement of science.\n\"I know, I 'll give them to Smarty\nSailor. He can pretend to be a citizen\nhere if I patron is e him. Yes, I see it all\nnow. He can do my music chores for me,\npublicity and other menial tasks, whilst I take all the kudos for picking the music\nand conducting it. Yes, yes, how brilliant\nam I. And no-one will dare question my\nmisappropriation of the Baron's treasure, it's such a small sum anyway,\nbecause I'm terribly important, and I shout a lot at people to stop them\nthinking for themselves. That Smarty is\nsuch a whining ninny, he's bound to fall\n\u2022'for it, quaver, stave and singer. \"Call\nSmarty Saylor,\" he roared at his\nsecretary.\nSmarty, whining, list e less, cringe-inducing brown-nosed toady, instantly\nobeyed the summons to Eric's vile room.\n\"Now look here, you can become a cheapskate citizen if you really want to,\nlittle boy. You can have a job and lots of\nmoney and pretend to carry on with\nyour research. All you have to do is run\nthe Baron's choir for me.\"\nSmarty's brown eyes became\nrefulgent. \"Run the Baron's choir,\" he\nrepeated. \"Wow.\" Smarty could sing,\nalthough he was now a high tenor after\nhis distressing encounter with Arthur\nMichael. To run the choir would indeed\nbe a position of magnificence.\n\"That's right,\" smiled the wretched\nEric, \"just repeat what I say. Now run\nalong, I 've got far more important things\nto do than talk to you. Oh, here's something to keep you going,\" Eric\ncasually tossed Smarty a malodorous\nbag containing a score-and-a half of\nsilver pieces.\nWill Smarty catch the malodorous\nbag?\n\\hh at is the connection between the\nmalodorous bag and Christine\nTeller?\nWhy has the FELIX Editor got it in\nfor Martin S Taylor?\nThe answers to these and many\nother questions in next week's exciting episode of The Baron of\nCheapskate.\nBEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS\nMr. Don Clark, Estates Secretary, and\nMr. Hector Cameron Clark, Senior\nSurveyor.\nDon Clark is responsible to Governing\nBody for the improvement and maintenance\nof the College Estate. He joined College in\n1961 as a surveyor and has been promoted\nthrough the Estates section to become its\nHead. Since in the journey across Don's mind we are unlikely to be over exerted I shall also introduce his deputy Hector\nCameron Clark.\nDon is an affable, humerous man, possibly\nthe most approachable administrator in College. However, this only makes his frequent\nblunders all the more unfortunate. The old\nduffer is kept on his toes by his secretary,\nthe formidable dragon Miss Lavinia ElderCowin\u2014a one woman Berlin Wall. Her verbal minefield (\"I think it's going to rain, don't you....?\") prevents all but the most persistent visitor from seeing Don.\nHector is a nasty little man reminiscent of\none of the characters that Peter Lorre may\nhave played in a1950s movie brandishing a stiletto. He supplements rather than compliments Don as Ygor did to Dr Frankenstein.\nThe metaphor can be extended to the College which was assembled during Don's time\nhere. Its symbolic perfection has been lately\nfound to have been purely superficial.\nCracks have appeared in the Holland Club,\nand the Huxley Building. Bits have dropped\noff Weeks Hall and Evelyn Gardens with\nmonotonous regularity.The RSM roof had\nbe replaced, as did the asbestos tiles they\nsheltered. Thus we can see that the monster\nis biting back.\nDon and Hector both appear to support\nand develop new projects with great enthusiasm and promise early completion. They\nhave done this on and off for three years\nover the central laundry. The Southside\nGym and Weights Room should have been\ncompleted over the summer but has only\njust been begun. Electric sockets can still\ntake up to 14 months to fix. It has been said\nthat Estates is understaffed yet this cannot\nexplain the attitudes and inefficiencies of\nsenior members of the section.\nI hear that Don made a few serious blunders over the summer which can only weaken his already fragile cause at IC. Details of\nthis will be forthcoming unless the customary \u00a35 is donated to ICU Rag.\nMole\nPage 12 Friday, October 7,1903 Free! Felix\n\n"

    "content": "letters\n\u2022Letter^-to-f lie Ef'i^ or Get It\nRight\nDear Pallab\nYour subversive left wing\ntendencies and your corrupt\nunscrupulous methods have\nlong been apparent. As a representative of IC's silent\nmajority I implore you to cease\nyour totalitarian control of the\nletters page. We have turned a blind eye to your associations\nwith shady, bankrupt printing\nfirms. The whole of IC has\nlaugh ted at your definition of\nracism, under which a non-racist country ought to pay for\nthe education of the rest of the\nworld. Consoc has put up with\nthe deliberate, and systematic\nsabotage of its handbook.\nHowever the last straw was a fake article printed under Consoc in last week's FELIX. If I named the most obvious sus-pec ts,I would undoubtedly be\naccused of 'racism' or 'sexism',\nor antipathy towards your\n'carefully selected ethnic minority news team'. Whilst I realise\nthat there is little chance of this\nletter being printed, I must at\nleast try to appeal to the vestiges\nof your conscience.\nYours upstanding ly Jonathan Gerson\nConsoc Chairman\nPS: The bit in the fake article\nabout Soc Soc being the place\nfor w hinge ing snivelling little\nbastards wasn't too bad.\nMy sincere apologies, Jonathan.\nI thought it was unusual for a Consoc article. It was so well\nwritten and amusing.-Ed.\nSlug\nSpeaks Out\nDear Pallab\nI am writing concerning the\nIC Union Handbook which I have just read. To clarify\nmatters to the recent arrivals at\nCollege, to whom the Handbook was sent, the Handbook\nEditor was Adrian James, the\nprevious news editor on\nFELIX. I would hope he has\nnot benefitted from the excellence of reporting and intrigue\nfor which FELIX is always\nadvertised. I suspect that a large,\npart of the Handbook was not\nedited by Mr James but written\nPage2 MMMMHHMHM1\nby him, and through this, the\nemphasis and accuracy of the\ninformation, when related to\nthe medium may be question-able. I would refer you to the\narticle on bars: re Southside\n\"Most students take their\ndrinks to the Upper Lounge.\"\nThis is an obvious factual\ninaccuracy when calculated on\npure numbers; if however it\nrefers to Mr James' friends then\nthat is conceivable. Re the\nUnion Bar: \"This is where most\nof the heavy drinking in College\ngoes on. On Barnights (organ-is ed by CCUs and various\nCollege drinking clubs) this\nplace should be avoided. At all\nother times it is bearable.\"\nDigest for a moment; I will\nreturn to the inaccuracies but\nfirst to the emp ahs is. This\nCollege has seen a dramatic\ndecline in the standard and\nfortunes of the Union Bar over\nthe past five years. It used to\ncontain many people on every\nevening and was full at least\nthree times a week. The bar's quintessential flavour was generated by the number of people\nand the character of those\npeople who used it. This does\nnot mean that bar night behaviour was the norm for\nevery night, nor would one\nwish it to be so; though it was\ncertainly not the place for those\nwishing to discuss the aesthetic\nproper ites of a pile of bricks\nover two hours and a half of\nbitter shandy.\nThe decline has been due to\nthe increase in pressure on\nstudents related to work and\nemployment, the increase in\nentrance standards and hence\nthe change in the balance of\ncharacters (not individuals but\ntypes) at College and the bar\nmanagement. The various relative influences of these factors I leave to other people. I feel we\nwould do no one a service by\ndissuading them from entering\nthe Union Bar; as a student bar\nthe union is entering its death\nthrows, and as such we should\nencourage its resurrection, by\nincreased \u2022 custom. I would\nsuggest the very times Mr James\nadvocates attendance, when it is\npopulated by workmen, s caf folders, builders, estates and a few 'train spotters' perhaps the\nodd orchestra, is the very time\nto put people off; if they have\nreceived the understanding that\nthis is the better side and true\nnature of the Union Bar. I would concede that occasions\nsuch as bar nights are also not\nto be treated as the average or\nthe best. Let the Union revert to\nthe full, lively knock-about bar\nthat it was of yesteryear;\nreleasing the others to serve the\ncustomers for which they were\nintended.\nReturning to the accuracy of\nthe quote. I think I understand\nthose to whom he incorrectly\nalludes as 'drinking clubs';\nthough it is certain they have\nnever organised a 'bar night'. If\nthey had, and half of that\nwhich is attributed to them was\ntrue, coupled with their perceived false reputations, it would\nhave been an event which might\nhave caused a holocaust to\nworry even C ND. Further,\nwith the RSMU's preference\nfor Southside, I doubt that\nmost of the heavy drinking is\nnow done in the Union.\nTo those reading the Union\nHandbook I would suggest\ncaution in accepting Mr James'\nview of College and would\nencourage them to find out for\nthemselves, with an open mind.\nYours\nSlug\nA Likely\nTail\nDear Pallab\nI feel I must tell your readers\nabout Mooney's excellent meals\nservice. The shepherd's pie\nmust be tried, full of good\nmeaty nourishment, though I was disappointed by the lack of\nmarrow bone variety.\nYours sincerely\nP Chum\n(Catering Manager Battersea\nDogs Home)\nFELIX\nExposed\nDear Pallab\nCongratulations on your\nFreshers' FELIX\u2014an excellent\nproduction. It lacked only one\nthing, the gratuitous use of\nnipples.\n' Yours\nDavid Rectal\nSatisfied?-Ed.\nCorrupt and\nSelf Seeking\nDear Pallab\nCongratulations on producing\nyour first two issues of FELIX.\nHowever, I must say that your\npresent campaign against\nMichael Arthur is disgraceful.\nSome of the things you have said\nin the course of it are tantamount\nto suggesting that not only is he\narrogant, unhelpful and with no\ninterest in the problems of\nordinary students but also that he\nis a right poof ter. Both these\ncharges are as false as they are\ndisgraceful. (Mind you I couldn't help laughing at the last one.)\nI was further surprised when,\nin your vacation issue of FELIX,\nyou described last year's dedicated and hard working Union\nPresident Stephen Goulder as\n\"corrupt and self-seeking\". Have\nyou changed your opinion since\nyou proposed him for for this\npost last year, or are you wilfully\nand knowingly responsible for\ninflicting, in the light of your own\nwords, such an unsuitable person\non the Union?\nYours sincerely\nJ Martin Taylor\nI \u2014 IH'l li lUll l III Felix\n\n"

    "content": "Bluebells\nring In\nNew Year\nThe New Year's Party is never an easy gig\nfor any band with a large proportion of\nthe audience being at the venue for the\nfirst time and still suffering from culture\n(or lack of culture) shock. Dancing does\nnot come easily. Also this was the best\norganised New Year's Party for at least\nfour years with both bands competing\nagainst two discos and other entertainments which also attracted large crowds.\nSupport band Magic Box had come\nfrom Scotland looking for a record deal.\nAlthough their music was highly dance-able almost everybody stood still and\ntheir similarity to Simple Minds in both\nsight and sound may well work against\nthem in the future. Nevertheless they received a deserved encore.\nThe Bluebells are also Scottish and\nplay a much more straight forward version of rock'n 'roll with two guitars and\nplenty of harmonica and tambourine.\nThankfully they beefed up their sound\nfrom their last single, the Alan Tarney\nproduced Sugar Bridge (Tarney also produces Leo Sayerand Cliff Richard) which\non record was as sweet and insubstantial\nas its title but live was given a much more\nsatisfying and boisterous treatment.\nTarney was brought in when their first\ntwo singles Forever More and Cath failed\nto get beyond the lower reaches of the\nTop 75 but his production methods were\nno more successful and their debut al-bum, which is due for release early in the\nnew year, will be produced by Colin Townley (producer of Costello's Pills and\nSoap).\nA welcome change of pace was The\nPatriots Game, a song by Dominic Behan\n(brother of the late Irish author Brendan)\nabout a young man joining the IRA. Sung\nin a slow and regretful voice it is a moving\ncase of disillusionment when the ends\ndon't justify the means.\nAlthough receiving a better reaction\nthan the support, the band were obviously disappointed by the audience whom\nthey later said were \"a bit dead\".\nTheir main drawback is that they just\nwant to be a pop group. This has virtually\nbecome a two-horse race between the\ncoiffured and costume pop of England\nand the much more talented sound of\nyoung Scotland.\nIronically signed to London records\n(formerly Decca) the Bluebells are well\non their way to success with an American\ntour coming up. They're signed to Warner\nBrothers in America and have gained\nmuch experience supporting Elvis Costello and Nick Heyward.\n\\Music\nWHEN PETER RODGERS AGREED TO WRITE A WEEKLY ROCK PAGE FOR FELIX\nIT WAS ON THE EXPRESS CONDITION THAT HE GOT TO MEET ONE OF BANANA RAMA. HIS PROMISE WAS FULFILLED AT THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY LAST MONDAY SO HERE HE REPORTS ON THE BLUEBELLS and MAGIC BOX WHO PLAYED AT THE PARTY AND REGGAE STARS CLINT EASTWOOD AND GENERAL\nSAINT WHO HEADLINE THE FIVE BAND SHOWCASE AT TO NIGHT'S FRESHER S' BALL. Catch that Train\nIt is highly surprising that Clint Eastwood and General Saint are not household\nnames already. As far back as the riots of 1981 their single Another one bites the\ndust was a cult favourite and enjoyed great success in the independent charts.\nThis coupled with their dynamic stage show (backed by the Inity Brothers and\nseen on television at the end of 1981) has made them critical favourites and their\nlast album Stop That Train enjoyed rave reviews but again managed only\nindependent success.\nThe excellent title track was released as a single being one of several\nrevamped old songs on the album which were complemented by biting political\nsongs about nuclear war and police harassment.\nThe duo have evolved from straight forward 'toasting' to include wider\ninfluences and although this has angered some reggae purists, it should lead to\na memorable performance tonight. Other attractions include the Neutron\nHurricane Force Steel Band and a West Indian disco late into the night.\nFelix Friday, October 7,19B3 Page II\n\n"

    "content": "\u00ab\ndi tori a. Fremantle\nCollege took a risk when they took on the Fremantle\nknowing that it was structurally a little dod gy. They were\nforced to accept it in the light of the acute housing\nproblem faced by students in London. On the whole they\ndid the right thing since the Fremantle. however badly\nmaintained, is both cheap and convenient for students.\nWhat really annoys me about recent developments in\nthe Fremantle is Michael Arthur's single minded intention to put as many students into the Fremantle as\npossible no matter what kind of state the rooms are in.\nPerhaps he\"s making out that there is nothing wrong with\nthe rooms because its ultimately his fault that the rooms\nare in such a state now. He should have made sure that the\nwork was done properly, months ago instead of having to\nsettle for a botched job done in a couple of days.\nNews has just reached us that a faulty smoke alarm,\nreported last session, failed to go off when a lamp on the\nfourth floor caught fire last night.\nRefectories\nI am pleased to see that Dr Simon Perry has taken a very\npositive approach as Chairman of Refectories Committee. He seems genuinely concerned about the standard of\nCollege refectories in his article on page 5. The changes\nadvocated by Dr Perry seem very superficial. Giving the\nButtery a facelift or changing the food served at different\noutlets have made sod all difference. The food tastes as\ninsipid and foul as ever. I hope Dr Perry succeeds in\nimproving the quality of the food\u2014I don't think he will.\nThe problems he lists with refectories sound like a string\nof excuses. There is really only one problem with re fec tories. Victor Mooney.

Five\nof my friends were awaiting their results, and their\nSenior Tutor, Adam Worried, foolishly entrusted me\nwith their grades. I gathered all five to my room.\n\"Two of you got firsts, and the other three got\nthirds,\" I announced. \"I will now tell each of you the\nresult of two of the others. No pair of results will be\nrepeated.\"\nHaving done this, I said \"No-one knows their own\nresult yet. However, I will tell you that I gave Alan's result to Barry, Chris, Diana and Elaine.\n\"Now I know everybody's result,\" said Alan.\n\"Were you told mine?\" asked Barry.\n\"No,\" said Alan.\n\"Then I know mine,\" added Chris.\n\"On hearing that, I know mine.\" remarked Elaine.\nSo, who got what?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the FELIX\nOffice by 1:00pm on Wednesday. \u00a35 from Mend-a Bike for the randomly selected winning entry.\nI 've received two entries for the crossword set in\nMonday's FELIX. They were completed by two members of the same department and year, and are\nidentical, which would not be bad were it not for the\nfact that they have made the same mistakes. I can\nonly assume that they have been working together; I have no objection to that, so long as only one answer\nis given in.\nA lack of space means that there isn't room to write\nthe solutions to Pinocchio's last puzzles, but the\nwinners are:\nThe Art of Subtle Reproduction\nThe winner was Robert Macrae, now Elec Eng 2 I suppose, who managed to produce an answer of\n6.6m. Election Special\nThe winner was Richard Fox of Chem Eng 3.\nShockhorra Probes\nThe only entrant was Leann Jones, now of Maths 3.\nFELIX Crossword\nAgain only one entrant, so the prize goes to A Knap,\nwho is probably now Physics 2.\nMy first puzzle attracted only one entrant, The\nprize goes to Phil Moore, then of Elec Eng 3.\nThe puzzle in the post grad FELIX, set by Achilles,\nwas correctly solved by Barry Franklin.\nAll the above can collect their \u00a35 prizes from the\nFELIX Office any time after 1:30pm next Monday.\nIf any society wishes to publicise an event through this column, would they please let me know a few\nweeks in advance and I will set a puzzle for them\nappertaining to that society. Furthermore, could\nthey also say what prize they would offer.\nIf anyone has any finished or half-complete puzzles of their own and wish them to be used in this\ncolumn, could they drop their idea in my box in the\nFELIX Office.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince ConsortRd, SW7\nTel 01-5S95111ex tn1048 or internal 2881.

The damp in some\nrooms was so bad that mould\nand fungi was growing on the\nwalls.\nThe poor state of repair of\nthe Fremantle was bought to\nthe attention of Michael\nArthur, Student Services\nOfficer, as early as July. Mr Arthur asked the landlords of\nthe Fremantle to make the\nnecessary repairs but nothing\nwas done for four months.\nWith the start of term rapidly\napproaching College put further pressure on the landlords\nby threatening to withdraw\nfrom the Fremantle and eventually hurried repairs were\nmade.\nMr Arthur settled for what\nmany people involved with\nthe Fremantle see as a totally\nbotched job. A number of\ncosmetic repairs were rushed\nby the landlords in just two\ndays. The damp and dry rot\nhad merely been painted over\nand alterations to the roof\nwere next to useless.\nMatters were so bad that\nlast week ICU President\nGaynor Lewis did not want\nstudents to be put into the\nrooms. However she was\npersuaded against her better\njudgement by Michael Arthur\nto rent the substandard accommodation to students desperate for somewhere to live.\nThe hotel was leased to College last year by the Astor\nHotel group with the knowledge that there were a number of faults. Despite this the\nHotel was taken because it\nwas felt that it provided\nreasonably cheap and convenient accommodation for\nstudents. It seems the gamble\nhas not paid off with some\nquite serious structural faults\ncoming to light.\nAn authoritative source in\nthe Estate Section said that\nthe cosmetic repairs made by\nthe landlords would not last\nmore than a few weeks, the\napproaching cold weather\nand rain would restart the\nsame problems.\nHumphrey Grumpy\nRCS Shocked as Sue Humphrey resigns.

    "content": "Mick Gets the Boot Rape Alarm\nThe Executive Committee of IC\nUnion has overturned a decision\nby Deputy President Christine\nTeller to charge a \u00a34 deposit for\nall rape alarms.\nUnion Council policy is to\nissue rape alarms to any woman\nwho wishes to have one. Since\nthere was no provision in Union\nfunds for this kind of expend i ture, Miss Teller decided to\ncharge a \u00a34 de pos jt to those requiring a rape alarm. The deposit\nwould be refunded when the rape\nalarm was returned.\nThe objection at the Exec\nmeeting was raised by Mike\nStuart Guilds President since he\nfelt that her action was going directly against Council policy.\nMiss Teller will now not be\nordering any more rape alarms\nsince she feels that she cannot\nfind the money to pay for them.\nThere have been ten cases of rape\nand violence against women\nreported over the past fourteen\nmonths in Notting Hill, a mere\ntwo miles from College. Most\nalarmingly three rapes have\noccured in the last eight weeks.\nPolice activity has been\nstepped up in the area, but this\nmay, unfortunately, mean that\nthe rapist may change his\nterritory. So far the police only\nhave a vague description of the\n'Beast of Kensington'. His\nvictims could hardly be described\nas careless about security, so\nthere is extra reason for extreme\nvigilance.\nThe rapist's acts have certainly\nstruck a real fear and anxiety in\nthe women of Notting Hill. Let us\nhope he is soon caught.\nLinstead Hall Warden Dr Richard Clarke and Subwarden\nRaj Chandra are pressing College to reconsider what they believe\nis an insensitive and rigid application of rules over the messengers\nsystem.\nThe Ents Mafia\nThey are dismayed that a month ago the Hall messenger,\nMr Mick Saul, was suddenly\ntransferred to the Beit Quadrangle. Mr Saul had been Linstead messenger for the last year.\nDr Clarke said that in this time he\nhad done an excellent job. His\nefforts not only saved the Wardens and Housekeeper considerable amounts of time, but made\nthe students feel very much at\nhome.\nMr Saul was moved in a periodic reshuffling of responsibilities in the messenger service.\nThis is a regular procedure\naccording to the Chief Security\nOfficer, Mr Geoffrey Reeves, so\nthat each messenger has detailed\nknowledge of at least three\nbuildings, therefore ensuring that\na satisfactory service can be\nprovided during holiday and\nsickness periods.\nThe timing of the move is\nunusual in that messengers are\nnormally moved every two years;\nMr Saul was at Linstead for just\none year.\nLinstead Hall is different from\nother Southside Halls, with its\nown bar and catering facility, a factor that Dr Clarke feels that\nCollege has not fully appreciated.\nMr Saul undertook a number\nof extra voluntary duties which\nwould not be expected of a messenger but are nevertheless\nessential for the smooth running\nof the Hall.\nOne down two to go\nRCS Honorary Secretary Miss\nSue Humphrey dropped a bombshell on the Union by\nresigning her post. The shock\ndecision was revealed in a statement read by President Eric\nDarbyshire at last Monday's RCSU meeting.\nMr. Darbyshire said at the\nmeeting that she resigned\nbecause of academic pressure.\nHowever in an exclusive interview with FELIX, Miss\nHumphrey revealed that this was\nonly part of the reason. She said\nthat there were differences of\nopinion between herself and the\nother senior officers in the way\nRCSU should be run.\nYet despite her resignation,\nMiss Humphrey will continue to\norganise the LInion's Freshers'\nDinners, thus ensuring no\ndisruption pending an election\nto replace her.\n5\noOO a.
