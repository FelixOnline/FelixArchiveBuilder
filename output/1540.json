It will consist of a\nbrief introduction, followed by speaking games in French, and will \ufb01nally\nconclude with a passionate \u2013 though\nhopefully friendly \u2013 debate between a\nfew brave souls willing to stand up and\nspeak in front of an audience!

    "content": "LOLCAT OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nCouncil rises up\nt was a good thing to see that\nCouncil decided to vote to\nhave a clear opinion on some-thing. Especially that people came to a decision and\ndidn\u2019t care what the sabbs thought\nand made up their own mind. This\nhappened on not one but two occa-sions, which was refreshing. Perhaps\nit had something to do with the seating change, where it was a circle. I\ninitially mocked it as \u201cbeing like an A\nLevel drama class\u201d, but maybe having a select few sit at the front of the\nroom does make people think they are\nabove them.\nI have made no secret of my opinions on the Translation Studies Unit,\nand wish them well in their fight. If you\nwant to know what I think then refer\nto my Editorial in Issue 1537. Hopefully\nthey\u2019ll get some clarity and will be kept\non. I just hope that the Management\nBoard aren\u2019t too proud to reconsider\ntheir decision. It would be pretty childish to basically just stick it out due to\nnot wanting to back down.\nHopefully the sabbs will all put\nforward the view of Council on their\nbehalf in meetings, rather than their\nown. That is what they are there to\ndo. It can be a tricky situation to be in,\nbut hopefully they explain that this is\nthe view of Council. Of course, they\nare free to express personal opinions\ntoo, but should make sure they highlight what is their opinion and what is\nCouncil\u2019s.\nThe medicines decision was also\ngreat. The reason to oppose it based\non it being hard to implement in the\ncurrent framework is valid, but a lot of\nthings are hard to do in current frame-works. It would be good to see just a\ntad more idealism. Obviously being\nunrealistic and imagining you can do\namazing things overnight won\u2019t help,\nbut having an ideal goal that you acknowledge that you want to slowly\nwork towards is a good thing. Idealism, with a good dollop of pragmatism\nis the way forward. Have your ultimate\nideal, and do everything to reach it.\nDon\u2019t dismiss a goal as it seems un-likely. Embrace that it\u2019s a tough challenge and that it is an aim that you\nknow will take time and effort to reach.\nCOMMENT ARTS TECH\nDinosaurs dying? Arts are coming... Is Watson smart?\nComment has three great discussions going.

    "content": "COMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\nLeonardo Ialongo\nF\nA European Citizenship\nIn the first of two articles about our friends from across the Channel, Leonardo Ialongo lays out the case for European integration\nor an outsider to European\npolitics, or indeed politics\nin general, it can often be\ndi\ufb03cult to understand\nthe need for the European\nUnion. Of course it helped maintain\npeace, but was war really possible after the atrocities of the Second World\nWar? Although the common market\nwas a good and necessary step, why do\nwe need such a powerful body to regulate and limit our national sovereignty?\nNot to mention the incredible amount\nof money we have to \u2018donate\u2019 to other\ncountries because they cannot manage their economy well. All reasonable\nobjections, except they happen to be\nslightly false, or at least misguided.\nhe \ufb01rst myth, although probably the\nleast controversial, is that war was not\npossible after the Second World War.\nhis always reminds me of the famous\nH. G. Wells quote \u201cthe war to end war\u201d,\nreferring to the First World War. Many\nin fact believed that after the horrors\nof the Great War, no country would be\ninsane enough to once again start the\nrace to arms. However it did happen,\nand not because Hitler was a madman,\nbut because the war left behind poverty and resentment, sparking the rise of\nnationalism once again. he ECC and\nthen the EU have brought countries\ncloser together, allowing for the sorrows of the war to be a shared tragedy\nand responsibility. If after World War\nII the Marshall Plan and the ECC had\nnot set the conditions for growth and\nintergovernmental relation, war might\nhave not been such a remote possibil-ity.\nIf you believe that the EU had done a\ngood job protecting peace, you might\nstill question why, for example, British\nnationals have to pay higher taxes to\nrescue countries that did not manage\ntheir national budget well. Very often\nin fact, when discussing the Eurocrisis, conservative politicians in Britain, and other \u2018rich\u2019 countries such as\nGermany, complain about the fact that\ntheir taxpayers will be burdened by\nother people\u2019s faults. his is however a\nslightly misguided truth, as in fact most\nof this money is in the form of a loan,\nand should therefore be paid back. It\nis however even more ba\ufb04ing that the\ncitizens are frequently not aware that\nEurope works both ways. It is not just\ngiving: all the countries receive aid and\nbene\ufb01ts as well. he di\ufb00erence is that it\ndoes not go on the front page of every\nnewspaper. Recently he Guardian, in\nan article by Simon Sweeney, listed all\nthe bene\ufb01ts Britain received from the\nEU. I will list just a few to stress this\npoint:\n\u201c S t r u c t u r a l\nfunding to areas\nhit by industrial\ndecline; restrictions on land\ufb01ll\ndumping; cheaper\nmobile charges;\ncheaper air travel;\nimproved consumer\nprotection and food\nlabelling; single market competition; Europe-wide patent and\ncopyright protection;\nfreedom to travel, live\nand work across Europe; funded opportuni- t i e s\nfor young people to undertake study or\nwork placements abroad; access to European health services; labour protection and enhanced social welfare; holiday entitlement; the right not to work\nmore than a 48-hour week without\novertime; strongest wildlife protection\nin the world; EU-funded research and\nindustrial collaboration; counter terrorism intelligence.\u201d\nhere are more, but I think these will\nprobably su\ufb03ce.\nhe advantages Britain, and all the\nother countries, receives are not limited to internal competitiveness, funding for research and infrastructure,\nand improved welfare and security.\nhe biggest contribution is probably\nin terms of international standing and\ncompetition. he individual European\ncountries are not powerful enough to\nstand against giants such as China or\nIndia; the EU however is. It is the largest economy of the world, the biggest\nmarket and the number one exporter\nand importer worldwide. his could\nfurther improve if the EU had a single\nforeign policy: its in\ufb02uence would be\ncomparable if not superior to that of\nthe United States of America, allowing\nthe EU to defend even more the interests of European citizens. A united foreign policy and representation could\nfurther help the European countries,\nwhich are at the forefront of dealing\nwith most issues related to sustainability and human rights, to further demand the implementation of European\nor similar legislation worldwide.\nIn confronting big challenges\nsuch as climate change, the\nEuropean Union could be the\nmajor player in triggering the\nglobal reforms necessary for\nsafety and prosperity.\nIn an increasingly globalised society the role of\nsingle nations has necessarily been reduced. More\nEuropean integration allows for the interests and\nsecurity of European citizens to\nbe protected on an international stage\nwhere single nations have lost their\nin\ufb02uence. It would also encourage the\nEU to take a \ufb01rmer stand on some of\nthe issues that plague our word today,\nsuch as climate change, human rights\nand regional con\ufb02ict. It further allows\ngreater international and inter-Euro-pean competitiveness, strengthening\nour economies and decreasing internal\ntensions. he last and often less mentioned bene\ufb01t is the increased mobility\nand opportunities, which encourages\nthe collaboration and sharing of culture and ideas.\nhese are all bene\ufb01ts which European countries should not forget at the\n\ufb01rst sign of a crisis.\nNext week Leonardo will address the\nissues facing a collective Europe today.\n\u201c\nThere are\nbenefits\nwhich European countries should\nnot forget at\nthe first sign\nof crisis\nr a l\nreas\nstrial\nstricand\ufb01ll\nheaper\nharges;\ntravel;\nnsumer\nnd food\ngle mar-tion; Euatent and\nrotection;\ntravel, live\nacross Euin terms of international standing and\nor sim\nIn c\nsuch\nEur\nma\nglo\nsa\nb\ns\nsecurit\nbe protecte\nwhere sing\nEUROPEAN UNION\nUNITED STATES OF\nEUROPE\nPASSPORT\nWhat are EU lookin\u2019 at?\n\n"

    "content": "The Nano Flower\nAlex Savell looks at the final Greg Mandell novel\nn just a day\u2019s time Peter Hamilton will be arriving for SciFi\u2019s annual convention, Picocon. Before that we are going\nto \ufb01nish o\ufb00 our look at the\nGreg Mandel series with a look at the\n\ufb01nal novel; he Nano Flower. Set \ufb01fteen year\u2019s after A Quantum Murder\nthere\u2019s plenty that\u2019s changed in that\ntime. he Nano Flower concludes the\nprogression of the world around Greg\nout of recession. Technology is blossoming and the world has started to\nmove forwards in leaps and bounds.\nhis is the \ufb01rst big di\ufb00erence with\nhe Nano Flower. Although the change\nin background maintains continuity\nwith the previous books, it does set a\nnew dynamic and is certainly the \ufb01rst\ntime that Hamilton pushes towards\na harder sci-\ufb01 setting. Asteroids are\nhauled into orbit in order to mine new\nresources, clean energy sources have\nput an end to the climate change problems of the recent past and in some\nways it\u2019s an extremely optimistic outlook on the future. However, perhaps\nmore interesting is seeing the world\nmove forwards while Greg stays still.\nWhen returning character Julia receives a strange package and rumours\nof new technology that threaten to\nthrow o\ufb00 the balance of power across\nthe globe and bring her company,\nEvent Horizon, to its knees, it\u2019s Greg\nthat she turns to for help; pulling him\nout of retirement. It\u2019s interesting to\nwatch Greg face a world where the advantages he held in previous missions\nare mitigated by technology that\u2019s increased without him. While he now\ngets to jet across the globe in a hypersonic plane, Mandel also has to cope\nwith the fact that the world has become a smaller place and the schemes\nof criminal organisations can easily\nencompass an entire globe.\nNot to mention potentially the most\ncontentious issue of the book; aliens.\nhe \u2018package\u2019 that Julia receives is in\nfact the eponymous Nano\ufb02ower and\nit is certainly a mystery. Containing\nDNA that is far in advance of any of\nour own and with genes completely\nforeign to Earth, the Nano\ufb02ower presents a dangerous and intriguing mys-tery. However, for me it was very much\na confusing addition to the Mandel\nsetting. I wasn\u2019t initially convinced\nthat the world needed the addition of\nany extra-terrestrial in\ufb02uences. To me\nthe series had been all the more interesting due to its plausibly near future\noutlook so I was going to take some\nserious winning over to be convinced\nthat this was a necessary addition.\nI must admit, I\u2019m still a little on the\nfence, but Hamilton\u2019s writing remains\nengaging and enthralling and he certainly goes a long way to winning my\nopinion back round to the inclusion of\nthis new theme. I still don\u2019t necessarily understand the decision, perhaps I\nwill get the chance to \ufb01nd out tomorrow in his talk, but I have a sneaking\nsuspicion, or at least an inkling, that\nit might be to do with the following.\nHamilton has openly said that part of\nwhat he enjoys about writing is creating worlds and the backdrops upon\nwhich the plots play out. As such I\nthink it may have been a decision to\n\u2013 almost aside from Greg, Julia and\nEvent Horizon \u2013 show mankind\u2019s slow\nascendancy into a much larger uni-verse. hat\u2019s a very optimistic view\nfrom where the world is in Mindstar\nRising; in less than a couple of decades humanity moves from a narrowly\naverted apocalypse to begin their forays into the starts.\nDespite several things that, with\nhindsight, look a little less than real-istic, the Greg Mandel series is still\ncompelling and an excellent read and,\nas it hits its twentieth birthday, it\u2019s still\ndoing extremely well. he covers you\nmay have seen opposite these articles\nare the 2011 incarnation of the series,\nwhere Greg got a bit of a facelift and, in\nan homage to the trilogies of 70s sci-\ufb01,\nput together, they form one extended\nimage of Hamilton\u2019s world progressing from ruins through to a skyscraper\nclad metropolis reaching to the sky. A\n\ufb01tting visual for a world that grew up\nas I once did while reading it.\nPeter F. Hamilton will be at Imperial\nCollege on Saturday. February 16 as\none of the Guests of Honour at Picocon\n30. For more information, and to register your attendance, visit icsf.org.uk/\npicocon\nI\nBooks were better when I was young-er. I\u2019m sure of it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m\nbecoming more experienced, or\nmore cynical, or if I was simply lucky\nenough to be introduced early to a\nlarge amount of really excellent \ufb01ction, but I \ufb01nd it very hard to bring\nto mind any books in my adult life\nthat a\ufb00ected me as powerfully as my\nchildhood favourites.\nhis book is the exception.\nhe modern urban fantasy genre\nhas experienced a resurgence over\nthe past decade, and in some ways\nA Madness of Angels is part of that\nmovement. At base, it\u2019s the story of\nurban sorcerer Matthew Swift, who\nwakes up one day with vivid and troubling memories of his own death and\nno understanding of how he has returned from the grave or how the city\nhe used to know has changed. Oh,\nand he\u2019s now sharing his body with a\ngroup of powerful entities of elemental magic, the blue electric angels.\nEverybody wants to get their hands\non Swift and his new passengers and\nhe/they are precipitated into a plotline of battles, alliances and betrayal\nas they struggle to come to terms\nwith their new existence and destroy\na powerful sorcerer \u2013 Swift\u2019s mentor\nand later his murderer \u2013 to win the\nright to their freedom.\nSo far, so generic \u2013 but what lifts\nGriffin\u2019s book above its genre is the\nexecution. A Madness of Angels is sur-real. It\u2019s vivid. It\u2019s alive. It\u2019s disturbing\nand enthralling and spectacular, the\nkind of book that grabs hold of the\nreader\u2019s imagination and won\u2019t let go,\nlong after its been put down. It\u2019s not\nonly about Swift and his return from\ndeath: it\u2019s about London and magic\nand life, and Swift, with his/their\nunique, not-quite-human, viewpoint\nis the perfect narrator for a London\nfull of Gaiman-esque urban legend \u2013\ngraffiti artists whose work comes to\nlife after dark; the Old Bag Lady who\nreads the omens in tattered shopping\nbags; the Last Train that travels the\nCircle Line eternally, chasing its own\ntail. Griffin revels in the madcap fantasy trappings of her setting; but with\na deft twist of perspective she also\nuses them to turns the mundane and\nordinary into something glorious.\nhe book has \ufb02aws, of course. he\nchanges of perspective between\nSwift and the angels can be confus-ing, as can the terse, often unattributed dialogue, and some characters\ndon\u2019t receive enough \ufb02eshing out,\nlike apprentice sorcerer Dana Mikeda\n\u2013 what\u2019s she up to anyway, and why\ndo we even care? But the book rises\nabove all this, becoming a delight to\nread through the evident fascination\nand wonder Griffin \ufb01nds in her story.\nAbove everything else, A Madness of\nAngels is full of pure joy.\nKate Gri\ufb03n is a pen name used by the\ntwice Carnegie-nominated fantasy\nauthor Catherine Webb for her adult\n\ufb01ction. She will be at Imperial College for Picocon 30 on the weekend of\nFebruary 16-17.

Beliefs are frequently rooted in complex identities. hese can\ninvolve shared culture, social relationships and family networks. In addition\nbeliefs often have a physical dimension\n\u2013 food customs, dress codes, and postures for prayer. And all of these will\nhave an emotional component and be\npart of deep personal memories, values and expectations. his rich human\nexperience cannot be explored in a\ndebate over ideas. Dialogue partners\ndo not seek agreement, and there is no\nwinner. he challenge of dialogue is in\nexploring profound di\ufb00erences of view\n\u2013 and staying calm. he bonus, howev-er, is that we discover the unique personal perspective of the other person.\nWe also start to see how our beliefs,\nand very identity, are seen by others.\nhis is not always a comfortable expe-rience. It is far easier to stay with our\nown assumptions, projections, and\ntribal fears than enter into dialogue.\nAt a conference at Yale last summer I listened to Eboo Patel, President\nObama\u2019s Interfaith Advisor. Patel, a\nMuslim, is the Founder of the Interfaith Youth Core. his is a student led\ninterfaith movement across US campuses promoting dialogue and social\naction. Patel was originally motivated\nby witnessing anti-Semitism and bullying in his high school. He has gone\non to champion better relationships\nbetween people of di\ufb00erent faiths, and\nnow between those who are religious\nand those who are secular.\nPatel argues \u201cI started to see atti-tudes, knowledge, and relationships as\nthree sides of a triangle. If you know\nsome (accurate and positive) things\nabout a religion, and you know some\npeople from that religion, you are far\nmore likely to have positive attitudes\ntoward that tradition and that com-munity. he more favourable your atti-tude, the more open you will be to new\nrelationships and additional appreciative knowledge. A couple of cycles\naround this triangle, and people from\ndi\ufb00erent faiths are starting to smile\nat each other on the streets instead of\nlooking away or crossing to the other\nside.\u201d\nIn the next few weeks there are a\nnumber of student led interfaith dia-logues. On Tuesday 26 February (18:15\nin Huxley 311) the Ahmadiyya Muslim\nStudents Association (AMSA), with\nthe Chaplaincy, are hosting a MuslimChristian dialogue about the origins of\nhumanity using the story of Adam and\nEve common to both traditions. his\nis followed by a series of three weekly\nlunchtime dialogue groups hosted\nby Aemun Reza, the Union\u2019s Interfaith O\ufb03cer, starting on Wednesday\n6 March (13:00 in Room 2, East Basement of Beit). he \ufb01rst topic for dialogue is \u2018I believe in\u2026Science\u2019.\nA Jewish-Muslim Dialogue led by\nJewish Society and AMSA is planned\nfor 4th March. And \ufb01nally, Islamic\nSociety are hosting a discussion on\n\u201cFreedom of Religion in Britain\u201d with\nrepresentatives from the Catholic Society, and the Atheists, Secularists and\nHumanists Society on Tuesday 19 February (Huxley 311).

I was lucky enough that my food\nwas cooked for me for most of my life.\nSo when I was \ufb01nally let loose in the\nkitchen, I have been going bonkers.\nHere is some of my favourite recipes\nthat I have made.\nBlueberry flapjack\nRevising hard and need a snack? Need\nsomething to go with your tea and getting bored of Hobnobs and (choco-late) Digestives? Here is a yummy and\nhealthier alternative - and it\u2019s super\neasy to make!\nIngredients:\n300g Porridge Oats\n150g Fresh Blueberries\n200g Golden Syrup\n170g Butter\n4 tablespoons brown sugar\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\nProcedure:\n1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees.\n2. Melt butter, sugar, syrup and cinnamon in a saucepan.\n3. Boil for a minute then remove from\nheat.\n4. Fold in oats until fully combined\n5. Scatter blueberries into mix and stir\nwell.\n6. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden.\nLick the pan if you wish to.\n7. Leave it to cool in tin before cutting,\notherwise it will just break! But do it\nbefore completing cool.\nScienti\ufb01c bonus \u2013 Oats will zap any\nfatigue and blueberries can slow down\nmemory loss!

Beat\nthe butter, sugar and vanilla together until the mixture\u2019s \ufb02u\ufb00y and then add the\neggs one at a time with plenty of beating\nin between.\n2) Add the \ufb02our and the milk a bit at a\ntime with plenty of stirring to make sure\nit combines properly. Bake the mixture\nin a 20cm square cake tin (or similar) at\n180\u02daC for half an hour (or until a skewer\ncomes out clean). Turn the cake out onto\na wire rack and allow to cool completely.\n3) Now to make the icing. Mix the icing sugar and cocoa well and add the\nmelted butter and around 75ml of boiling water until you\u2019ve got a smooth, fairly\nrunny consistency.\n4) Slice up your cooled sponge cake\ninto squares or rectangles of whatever\nsize you please (I prefer smaller, to allow for a greater chocolate to sponge\nratio) and dip the squares \ufb01rst\ninto the chocolate icing mixture and then into a bowl of\ndessicated coconut so that\nyou end up with squares of\ndelicious chocolately, coco-nuttygoodness(seepicture).\nwhich was very rich and fruity. he\nfamous Spritz was also o\ufb00ered to the\nguests and if you have never tried\nit before it is highly recommended\nthat you do.

No-one knows\nwhat the impact of the proposal would\nhave on College \ufb01nances (as was admitted by the author in the meeting), and\ntherefore on students should the College implement the framework.\u201d\nhe motion provided the following\nstatistics and information. A third of\nthe world\u2019s population lack access to essential medicines and each year, 10 million people die from treatable diseases.\n10% of funded research on medicine\nis spent on health problems that affect 90% of the world\u2019s population, the\nNeglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).\nIndustry is increasingly relying on academia for new drug targets because\nuniversities are an important source of\nnew medicines and drug targets. Presently, Imperial College develops and\npatents many of its healthcare-related\ntechnologies, which are licensed to\nmembers of the pharmaceutical indus-try. his makes it di\ufb03cult for medicine\nto be produced inexpensively. Universities including Oxford, Harvard and\nYale have had important roles in increasing access to needed medicines by\nimplementing Global Access Licensing\nPolicies and have not seen a negative\nimpact on licensing nor pro\ufb01ts. Generic pharmaceutical production has\nbeen shown to be the most e\ufb00ective\nmethod of ensuring access to resource\nlimited countries by reducing prices\nof medicine as a result of competition.\nIf Imperial College avoids patenting\nhealthcare-related technologies, there\nis an increased opportunity for prices\nof medicine to be made a\ufb00ordable to\nthose who need them.\nhe motion put forward on Tuesday\nbelieves that the products of publicly\nfunded research should be made available to all members of all societies and\nthat research value should be measured on the impact it makes on soci-ety. Furthermore, the motion believes\nthat Imperial College students should\nbe encouraged to learn about and consider a research career in the \ufb01eld of the\ndiseases that a\ufb00ect 90% of the world\u2019s\npopulation.\nImperial College Union resolves to\nactively campaign for Imperial College\nto sign onto the Global Access Licensing Framework. he Union also resolves to support inclusion of neglected\ndiseases topics on all relevant course\ncurriculums, particularly those in the\nDepartment of Life Sciences and Faculty of Medicine and to encourage UROP\n(Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme) projects on NTDs.\nUnion Council votes for access to medicines pa-per, despite no sabbatical officer voting for it\nZara Hason Reporter\nYulia Negreskul Reporter\npolicies, they will also contribute to a\nbigger picture as they will be part of the\nImperial\u2019s report to HEFCE, an organisation responsible for public funding of\nEnglish universities, which will then\nfeed into the Estates Management Statistics Survey from August 2013, which\nhas been designed to help managers understand current state of affairs, as well\nas to promote best practice and drive\nimprovement.\nLasting only 15 minutes to, Student\nTravel Survey is an opportunity not\nonly to make a contribution to the reduction of carbon footprint but also to\nwin a \u00a3100 Amazon voucher.\nEditorial, page 2\n>>\n\n"

A staggering ten billion condoms were used\nin 2005 (with probably only two million being used by Silvio Berlusconi).\nIt\u2019s predicted that 27 billion condoms\nwill be used in 2015. Suggesting that\nthe population is either growing rap-idly, or just becoming a lot hornier.\nPossibly a combination of both.\nEvery area has someone that wants\nto come in and shake things up. No\npun intended there. hese have taken\nmany forms, from female condoms to\nsome slightly stranger inventions. One\nguy, Jan Vinzenz Krause, invented a\nspray on latex condom. he trial didn\u2019t\ngo too well: all of the volunteers didn\u2019t\nwant to take part once they knew what\nit would involve. hat would be a pretty awkward study to be part of. \u201cSo,\nwhat, I take a tablet everyday that may\nbe real or a placebo and then track\nhow I am feeling?\u201d. \u201cErm, not exactly.\nTake o\ufb00 all your clothes while I get\nthe condom spraying machine\u201d... Ill\nfated tests aside, this wasn\u2019t ever\ngoing to be a winner. he\nreason being that it took\nthree minutes for the\ncondom to dry. Maybe\nI\u2019m wrong, but I think\nit may ruin the mood\na bit if you have to stop\nproceedings and say: \u201chang\non, I\u2019m going to spray latex on my penis and then wait for three minutes for\nit to dry. Watch out, just incase the la-WILKINSON \u2013 GABOR \u2013 LINSTEAD\nEastside Hall Senior Positions 2013-14\nThe wardening teams are looking for enthusiastic people to be part\nof the Eastside Halls senior teams for 2013-2014\nFor more information, contact seniors@eastsidehalls.org\nAPPLY NOW \u2013 DEADLINE FRIDAY 22nd FEBRUARY\nApplication forms can be downloaded from http://www.eastsidehalls.org/\nor obtained from the Student Hub in Sherfield Level 3\ntex drips on your bed.\u201d\nRecently, as reported in a feature\nin the New Scientist, two designers\nhave come up with what they\nthink is the next big thing in\ncondom design (oh so\nmany puns there).\nDanny Resnic and\nRay Chavez have\ndecided that making a condom with\npleasure as the focus\nwould make men more inclined to use them. hey used silicone,\nnot latex, and they \u2018fold\u2019 on rather\nthan roll on; this means there are textures and ridges, which they say make\nit a hybrid condom/sex toy. hey\u2019ve\nalso made the chamber where semen\nis stored a lock that is one way. hey\nhave held a trial where volunteers\nused them by themselves. You read\nthat right. hey gave people a con-dom, a room, and free reign on the in-ternet. hat\u2019s another slightly odd and\nawkward study to be included in and/\nor conduct. he results were all posi-tive, but given what they were asking\nthem to do, I\u2019m fairly sure that they\nwould say it was okay no matter what.\nWill this be the future of condoms, or\ncondomed to a mere curiosity?\n\n"

But have you ever seen a\nzombie fall head over heels in love?\nhat\u2019s right, here we have R (Hoult),\na zombie who falls in love with Julie\n(Palmer), one of the very few humans\non Earth after it is overtaken by the\nwalking dead. Ha, R+J... Get it? hese\ntwo star-crossed lovers have a lot of\nobstacles to overcome if they want to\nmake their romance work. here is\neven the obligatory balcony scene.\nIt\u2019s certainly an interesting spin on\na genre that isn\u2019t known for creativ-ity. With some excellent voiceover\nA follow-up to Knocked Up without\nactually holding onto any of its main\ncharacters, we instead have a closer\nlook at how aged, mature relationships\nwork, and in this case, how the \u201chappily ever after\u201d is much easier said than\ndone.\nDebbie (Mann) is 40 now although\nshe would never admit it. Impromptu\nshower-sex with her husband Pete\n(Rudd) on her birthday seemed all\ngreat to start with, until she discovers he took some viagra beforehand.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a turbo penis. I like your\nmedium soft one\u201d she says, with great\ndisappointment.\nAnd so begins Apatow\u2019s portrayal of\ngradual marital decline as well as his\nexcellent gags and one-liners. Whether\nthe \ufb01lm itself closely follows what ApaA Toy Story for the video-game gen-eration, instead of having cuddly little toys that come to life when no-one\nis around to look, we have a bunch of\narcade game characters who are free\nto roam around their own little world\nvia intricately designed trains and\nthe \u201cGrand Central Station\u201d.\nRalph (Reilly), as his name sug-gests, wrecks things. In his game \u201cFix\nit Felix\u201d it\u2019s his job to break every-thing, whilst the player controls Felix\nto \ufb01x all the damage caused by the\nbig bad guy. But Ralph doesn\u2019t want\nto be the bad guy anymore. He isn\u2019t\ninvited to any of the cool parties his\n\u201cgood\u201d characters are having, and\nwhenever anyone comes across him\noutside his game, they are too busy\nrunning away from the brute to even\nhear what he has to say.\nWanting to be fully accepted into\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about sex baby, let\u2019s talk\nabout you and me, let\u2019s talk about all\nthe good things, all the bad things\nthat may be, let\u2019s talk about sex!\u201d...\nhardly something you would expect\nto hear in a choir that consists of retired pensioners but with the OAPZ\n(Old Age PensionerZ), formality\nisn\u2019t their thing. Led by the bright\nand lovely volunteer music teacher\nElizabeth (Arterton), the oldies have\na blast singing away to some lively\nmusic.\nMarion (Redgrave) loves these\nsessions, although her husband Arthur (Stamp) can\u2019t think of anything\nworse to do with his time, and considers this his worst nightmare. Always refusing to join in on the fun,\nthis grumpy old man isn\u2019t the least\nimpressed, more so when his wife\ncollapses and falls seriously ill.\nwork from Hoult, who also masters\nthe American accent, it does raise intriguing questions. Here is a \ufb01lm that\nprovides a humane look at zombies\nwithout immediately painting them\nas cold-blooded killers. hey all have\ntheir own individual thoughts, they\nshow potential to change, all in ways\nthat seem to make some sense, relying on the audience\u2019s tolerance level\ntowards the \u201clove conquers all\u201d type of\nmessage.\nHoult, now all grown up from his\nAbout a Boy years, is a likable lead, who\ninitially appears as a horrendous, gothic \ufb01gure (look at the \ufb01rst picture on the\nright there and see if he\u2019s quite the \u201cRomeo\u201d material) but in fact he successfully plays on the goofy, dim-witted\nside of his character with maximum\ncomedy value. A lot of the \ufb01lm\u2019s laughs\ncome from his strange, hunched-over\ngait, as well as his inner thoughts.\nhere are some marked inconsisten-cies, and some not very well explained\nplot strands that lazily go unaddressed\nfor the sake of getting to the nice and\nneat, simple ending the \ufb01lm has been\nplanning all along. And it does have\nthe tendency to move quite slowly\nthroughout, somewhat similar to how\nthe dead walk on a daily basis, although\nbuilding up to a rather sizable \ufb01nale.\nthe game characters\u2019 community, he\ndecides the only way would be to win\na medal, any medal, that will prove\nthat he can also be a hero for once,\ninstead of constantly being outcast as\nthe villain.\nHe stumbles across a sci-\ufb01 shoot\u2019em\nup, where he meets the charismatic\nleader Sergeant Tamora Jean Calhoun (the invaluable Lynch who has\nplenty of dry, no-nonsense one-liners\nin a true Sue Sylvester style) and from\nthere after a series of unfortunate accidents he ends up in another game\nland where the sweets-covered Sugar\nRush kart-racing game takes place.\nhere, it turns out he would need to\nwin that race to get ahold of his med-al. Befriending Vanellope (Silver-man) another outcast/a glitch from\nthe game, the two unlikely pair form\nthe sweetest bond to work together.\nhere\u2019s the whole \u201cbe yourself\u201d\ntype of repetitive and tiresome message that gets jammed down everyone\u2019s throat which marks the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nonly serious misstep. Yes, yes we get\nit Ralph can still be a hero whilst being the villain in the \ufb01ctional game,\nwe all need to embrace who we are\nblah blah blah.\nBut there is plenty of imagination,\ngrand visuals, and head-spinning action here to keep everyone of all ages\nthoroughly entertained.\nWith an impending choir competi-tion, everything depends on Arthur\nto sing Marion\u2019s solo. Cheesy yes,\nbut it deals with Arthur having to\ndeal with ful\ufb01lling his ailing wife\u2019s\ndream, which mostly works thanks\nto the heavy-lifting done by the talented cast. Stamp is comically cold\nand distant but with an easily noticeable sensitive side that comes out in\nhis scenes with his on-screen wife.\nRedgrave is hugely e\ufb00ective as usual,\nwith her tear-inducing, superb rendition of Cyndi Lauper\u2019s \u2018True Colours\u2019\nshowing there is no limit to her abili-ties. Arterton adds a touch of youth\nand vibrancy to the mix.\nhere are convincing links between\nthe characters \u2013 Marion and Arthur,\nArthur and Elizabeth, and a particularly poignant one between Arthur\nand his distant son, James (Eccles-ton). he father-son relationship is\nsomething that could have possibly\nbeen expanded a little more, but the\nchemistry the two actors share say a\nwhole lot more than you would initially expect, and it\u2019s a surprising, enriching addition to the narrative.\nIt\u2019s, of course, entirely predictable,\nwith a rousing, feel-good ending you\nwill see coming from the very start.\nBut when everything is handled so\ntastefully with a dash of the occasional humour, a lot can be forgiven.\ntow may be going through in real-life\nwe\u2019ll never know, but the use of his\nactual wife (Mann) and their children\n(Maude and Iris) seems to suggest\nthere is an element of truth.\nAside from the lack of spice in their\nmarriage, the family faces \ufb01nancial dif\ufb01culties, stemming mostly from Pete\u2019s\nrecord company that is not doing well\nin the modern market, as well as Debbie\u2019s struggling jewellery store where\nshe suspects one of her employees (Fox\nand Yi) is stealing from her. Pete\u2019s father (the excellent Albert Brooks) is\nalso constantly on the prowl, asking his\nson for more money, whereas Debbie\u2019s\nwealthy but awkward father Oliver\n(John Lithgow) makes things tougher.\nIt o\ufb00ers no great original wisdom\non how a marriage should work, and\ndespite pondering on the question for\nover two hours (a long running time\nthat is occasionally felt), it goes down\nthe traditional corny route that involves a seemingly random accident\nthat makes everyone realise just how\nmuch they love each other. Hurrah.\nBut Apatow is no amateur when it\ncomes to writing the gags and \ufb01nding\nthe right people to deliver them. here\nare plenty of hysterical moments, along\nwith some exceptional cameo appear-ances.\nFelix Film get romantic for you as Valentine\u2019s Day passes\n\n"

To make the most of\nthe potential for a PB, a number of Imperial College Triathletes drove there\nin the early hours of Saturday. he\nteam included Alex Milne, Aimee DiMarco, Paul Bryant, Tom Pearson and\nHugh Mackenzie. he day dawned\nbright, cold and worryingly windy.\nhe lake is extremely exposed and\nwith a course consisting of out and\nback loops it meant running/cycling\ndirectly into a head wind and then\nreturning with a tail wind pushing\nyou along. Despite my reservations, I\nknew this was going to make for some\nexciting racing.\nhe start, as always at these short\nevents, was rapid with people quickly\ngaining 50m or so. his was no major\nworry, and as the \ufb01rst few kilometres\nprogressed the race started to unfold.\nAlex, myself and a well-known duath-lete Nick Shasha formed a front group\nof three and we steadily developed a\nlead pack entering T1 in 16.27. Following a rusty transition I came onto\nthe bike in second, a fair distance behind Alex. However we were straight\nonto the smooth tarmac around Dorney Lake, and with a strong following\nwind I was soon hitting 53 kph. Just\nbefore the \ufb01rst 180\u00b0 turn I had caught\nup with Alex, however, having not\nread the course map very well I veered\no\ufb00 towards the ditch whilst he calmly\nundertook me again. Once I had managed to get round the turn I settled\ninto a strong rhythm, and overtook\nAlex once again before setting about\nbuilding a lead. Heading into T2 an\nImperial alumnus Richard Winchester\nhad taken third place o\ufb00 Nick Shasha\nso it was looking like an Imperial 123.\nhe run o\ufb00 the bike is always test-ing, but with the following wind it felt\nas if we were really \ufb02ying. hen we\nwent round the turning point into a\nbrick wall of head wind, my Garmin\nstarted telling the truth and cramp set\nin. However I was able to settle into a\ngood pace and extended my lead. Alex\nalso ran well consolidating his second\nplace, however Richard was unfortunately piped in the \ufb01nal stretch by\nNick for third place. Aimee DiMarco\nhad a strong race. having just recovered from injury she powered through\nto \ufb01nish in 6th place. Tom Pearson\nalso had a notable performance competing in his very \ufb01rst duathlon. A\nstrong cycle leg pushed him up the\npack to \ufb01nish in 30st place out of 173\npeople.\nVotwo gonna do? Triathlon triumphs\nBUCS points galore for ICBC in Boston\nHugh Mackenzie Sports Writer\nICBC\u2019s high performance contingent made the ever dreary trip to\nBoston on Saturday 9th February\nand came out with some good re-sults, hopefully putting them in the\nmixer for international selection\nthis year. BUCS small boats head\nwas also incorporated into the GB\ntrials, so Imperial athletes were racing for Sport Imperial glory as well!\nIC\u2019s London 2012 Olympian Mel\nWilson picked up maximum BUCS\npoints and finished 11th in the\nWomen\u2019s trials, whilst Sport Imperial stalwart Zo\u00eb Lee finished 14th\nin the same race. Zo\u00eb has now been\ninvited to row with the GB squad at\nCaversham. Helen Wood and Leonora Kennedy came in 17th and 19th\nrespectively whilst Clio AubugeauWilliams came 11th of the women\u2019s\nunder 23s.\nWilf Kimberley is a dab hand at\nthis trials business after years of\nrepresenting GB, and he was the\nquickest under 23 lightweight of the\nday (and 11th lightweight overall).\nHe also came 2nd in the BUCS rank-ings. After Ben Spencer-Jones\u2019 spectacular Sculler\u2019s Head performance,\npressure was on to follow it up with\nanother strong row in the single. He\nfinished 8th of the under 23 heavyweight men and 4th in BUCS, just\nmissing out on the \u2018perfect\u2019 set of\nbronze BUCS medals in every boat\ndiscipline. There is always next year\nBen! Another sculler\u2019s head all-star\nGeorgie Phillips had a good row,\npicking up the BUCS bronze medal.\nLightweight Myles Holborough was\nthe 9th placed under 23 and 6th in\nBUCS. Paul Jones and Tim Richards\nboth struggled with illness and injury coming into the trials and finished 35th and 36th respectively in\nthe lightweight category.\nSam Scrimgeour has been spending much of the 2012-13 season\ntraining with the lightweight big\ndeals away from ICBC, but in Imperial colours he finished 9th overall.\nEx-IC rowers Adam Freeman-Pask\nand Jamie Kirkwood finished 2nd\nand 3rd respectively. I don\u2019t want\nto take too much credit but I taught\nJamie almost everything he knows.\nThe evening commenced with\nCaptain Spencer-Jones\u2019 21st birthday bash; with embarrassing stories\nand a fully stocked bar, the night\nwas always going to be messy. Those\nwho made it to Fez club in Putney\nwitnessed Matt Whaley\u2019s ice cold\npersona getting thrown out the window when the Baywatch theme tune\nwas dropped. The biggest light-up\ndance floor in Europe (allegedly)\nwitnessed some killer moves, the\nlikes of which may never have been\nseen outside Caius College, Cambridge.\nBUCS big boat head has been rearranged at Boston next weekend,\nso the poor residents will have to\nput up with Imperial stinky banter\nfor another weekend.\nIC rowers in 2016?\nBen Spencer-Jones Sports Writer\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\n30\nGoodbye, George\nJohn Park Film Editor\nA Place in the Sun (re-release)\nDirector: George Stevens\nScreenwriters: Theodore Dreiser\n(novel), Patrick Kearney (play),\nMichael Wilson, Harry Brown\nStarring: Montgomery Clift,\nElizabeth Taylor, Shelley Winters\nA Place in the Sun shows the tragic\nfall of a man who strived to gain everything in life: wealth, power, class,\nlove, and ultimately, happiness. He\nworked hard; very hard in fact, since\nhe had to work all the way up from the\nbottom of the corporate food chain.\nA little misunderstanding jeopardis-es everything and in a heart-beat, the\nman is left with nothing. It shows us\nthe fragile nature of objects around\nus, mirroring our very own human\nemotions.\nTo start with, George Eastman\n(Clift) is a not a well-o\ufb00 guy. His rich\nUncle Charles (the owner of the family business (Herbert Heyes)) gives\nhim one out of sympathy: he\u2019s in\ncharge of packaging swimsuits. It\u2019s a\nrepetitive and boring job but he appreciates it anyway. He meets a lovely\ngirl called Alice (Winters). She\u2019s not\nthe prettiest of all dames but her personality wins him over. Which is why,\ndespite the department policy of \u201cno\ndating co-workers,\u201d they start a secret relationship; but only for a short\nwhile. Realising what good work he\u2019s\nbeen doing for the company, Charles\ngives him a promotion, a promotion\nthat would introduce him to the high\nand fancy class whilst pulling him\naway from his love, Alice. Initially\nhe believes that nothing will change\nbut Alice doesn\u2019t quite buy that. She\u2019s\na smart girl and thinks that he will\nbe corrupted by the spoiled, upperclass money sharks. he more time\nhe spends with them, the more suspicious she gets. She can\u2019t help it;\nshe just doesn\u2019t trust him and those\naround him.\nBut it turns out that Alice is right\nto be concerned. George has met Angela (Taylor), the most beautiful aristocratic young girl who shows interest in him. So George is torn between\ntwo women. he woman he\u2019s vowed\nto be faithful to, and the woman who\nseems perfect for him. It also confuses the audience. He really does\nlove both of them. Alice is sweet and\nreliable but Angela is beautiful, guarantees wealth and gives him plenty\nof connections. But eventually, he\nstarts falling for the \ufb02awless looks.\nHe wants to ditch Alice and live the\nlife he always dreamed of. Alice is appalled by his behaviour and tells him\nthat she is in fact, pregnant. A scandal like that can ruin a man of such\nreputation. So when she threatens to\nreveal this little secret, he panics, and\nis desperate for a way out. Acting on\nan impulse, he decides that murder\nis the best option. But a tragic accident occurs that paints him as a cold-hearted criminal with no witnesses\nto prove otherwise.\nClift, no matter how many mistakes his character makes, is always\nthe likable victim anyone can feel\nsorry for. His camera-friendly features work exceptionally well to suit\nsomeone who goes through drastic\nchanges over the course of two hours.\nWhen he\u2019s poor, he\u2019s humble, willing\nto make sacri\ufb01ces, and incredibly\nsincere. He evolves, sees the bigger\nworld and the endless opportunities\nto gain something more out of life. He\nhas a dream, a little far out of reach\nof course, but a dream nonetheless.\nClift adds more and more intensity\nto his performance building to the\nclimax, proving to everyone that he\u2019s\nnot just a pretty face. Just watch the\nclose-up where George starts having second thoughts about killing\nhis pregnant girlfriend. He\u2019s wrecked\nwith guilt and fear. Even throughout\nthe long, sustained shot, Clift is fully\nengaged and never \ufb02inches, not for a\nsecond.\nhe two women surrounding\nGeorge, providing two opposite lifestyles are perfectly cast. Taylor, from\nthe moment she makes her \ufb01rst ap-pearance, establishes herself as a\nstriking character, a lively, energetic,\nfun-loving gal. She\u2019s not manipulative as one might expect her to be\n\u2013 she has absolutely no knowledge\nof Alice. Even after the accident oc-curs, she stands by him, supporting\nhim through the painful ordeal. She\nwasn\u2019t involved in the relationship for\nthe looks. She was after something\ndeep and meaningful.\nWinters plays Alice, the kind-hearted, quieter girl. She is also immensely lovable, although she does\nbecome too inquisitive for her own\ngood. But how can anyone blame her?\nIt\u2019s no secret that George has been\nchanging ever since he got the pro-motion. Alice may have come from\na humble background but she\u2019s far\nfrom blind. She notices that something is o\ufb00 and naturally, as a woman\nwho wants to hold on to her man and\nthe baby\u2019s father, she tries everything\nto make him stay. Her desperation\nnever appears malicious, but more\nheart-breaking, which Winters captures beautifully.\nNo true villain exists here, and\nno-one is ever fundamentally evil.\nhe \ufb01lm has aged a little, and the\nshocking moments have less impact.\nGeorge trying to convince Alice to\nget an abortion must have been an\nunthinkable request in the 50s, although today it\u2019s a common occur-rence. But the fantastic performances\nhave withstood the test of time and\nstill remain as impressive as ever. It\u2019s\na slow-burning melodrama with a\nfascinating love-triangle that doesn\u2019t\nhave a simple answer.\nWOOO I\u2019m totally making this my prof pic!\nIC Cinema Listings\nSightseers\nChris wants to show girlfriend Tina his world, but events soon\nconspire against the couple and their dream caravan holiday\ntakes a very wrong turn.\nTuesday 19th February at 18:30\nThursday 19th February at 18:30\nArtsfest Film Quiz\nThe legendary annual film-quiz returns.

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY\nTechnology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntech.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n33\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\nMaximilian Eggl\natson might be becoming smarter\nthan Holmes after\nall, if IBM gets its\nway.\nWatson was \ufb01rst unveiled in a game\nshow Jeopardy two years ago. Jeopardy\nis a game show where contestants are\npresented with the answers to questions\nthey are supposed to come up with.\nUnsurprisingly, even though Holmes\nwasn\u2019t on scene, Watson managed to\nbeat the two human contestants (who\nwere widely considered to be the best\nJeopardy players) hands down. Now that\nWatson has defeated its human overlords in a game of Jeopardy, it is ready to\ntake on the task of curing cancer.\nDeveloped by IBM since 2005, Watson was always envisioned as having a\nhigher purpose in medicine. Watson is\nan arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) system that\nis able to answer questions posed to it in\na natural language (i.e. a language spoken by humans). It does this by analysing connections and trends in data that\nhumans may not be able to. he clever\nMachine used this to play the game\nshow and is using this now in cancer\ntreatment. It compares a patient\u2019s medical records with what it has in its massive database, before recommending\ntreatments with con\ufb01dence levels\non e\ufb00ectiveness. However, Holmes,\nand in fact humans like the rest of\nus, need not be worried \u2013 Watson\nisn\u2019t as smart as it seems.\nhere are things that can stump\nWatson. Natural languages pose an\nextreme challenge to the AI, with\nits use of subtle nuances and implicit meanings. his was demonstrated\nduring the Jeopardy game when\nWatson answered several questions wrongly due to the use of\nimplicit meanings. Watson also\ndepends heavily on its database\nto be able to generate its answers.\nIt is fed with data, and using machine learning algorithms,\n\u2018learns\u2019 the information\nto build its database\nand make the necessary connections. So\nif there is something\nthat is not in its da-tabase, Watson would\nnot be able to know\nabout that piece of in-formation. It would not\nW\nbe able to make any \u2018educated guesses\u2019\neither. his all boils down to Watson\nnot being what philosophers call a\n\u201cStrong AI\u201d.\nA \u201cStrong AI\u201d is roughly an AI that\nhas an intelligence that matches or exceeds that of humans whereas a \u201cWeak\nAI\u201d is simply an AI that can act intel-ligently. A \u201cStrong AI\u201d would be able\nto understand and act on information,\nshowing signs of sentience. Watson is\nnot a \u201cStrong AI\u201d. Watson is simply a\nmachine that is following a set of instructions to analyse what it has in its\ndatabase. It does not \u201cunderstand\u201d the\ndata it has in the same way that humans do. his situation is illustrated in\nthe \u201cChinese Room\u201d thought experiment presented by John Searle.\nIn the \u201cChinese Room\u201d experiment,\nSearle hypothesised that if a computer\ncan, given su\ufb03cient and comprehensive instructions, produce outputs to\ninput Chinese characters in such a\nconvincing manner that it passes the\nTuring Test, it will be able to convince\na human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker.\nHowever, the question is whether the\ncomputer can literally \u201cunderstand\u201d Chinese, or is it merely\nsimulating the ability to understand Chinese. his is a\ncase of \u201cStrong vs Weak AI\u201d.\nSentient AI still remains in\nthe realm of Science Fiction,\nand we are unlikely to see\nsituations like those\nin the Matrix \ufb01lms\ncome true in the\nnear future. Watson\nmight be able to enable us to cure cancer in a more e\ufb00ective\nway, but it is not going\nto be able to think for itself any time soon.\nElementary, My Dear Watson, Now Go Cure Cancer\nYong Wen Chua is wondering if he could beat Watson at Jeopardy\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date\nwith the newest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nPhone for a Pretty Penny\nVertu, the maker of luxury smartphones, has just released its first android\ndevice. Previously owned by Nokia and producing symbian based phones,\nthe British company has decided on android for its future models instead of\nWindows 8. These phones reportedly cost up to \u00a37,000, and sport ruby keys,\na titanium body and a scratch-proof sapphire screen. On the spec side, the\nphone does seem somewhat lacking. The big question for me is, who would\nwant such a thing?\nHoney, there\u2019s YouTube on TV\nYouTube is becoming a TV channel on subscription free Freesat. However it\nwill not really be a channel, with shows and set-times etc., but more like an\napp on your TV. You will be able to watch videos and clips that you would\nnormally see on your PC on yout TV. Yay?\nDON\u2019T UPDATE YOUR iPHONE\nThe new ios 6.1 was released roughly a fortnight ago, and it hasn\u2019t come without controversy. According to various European mobile networks, including\nEngland\u2019s Vodafone, iPhone users should not update. Apparently customers\nhave recieved texts, warning them of the problems coming with the new software update.

Europe is the\nmain destination of UK trade: once\nout of the EU, and with the right to\nthe Four Freedoms lost, trade with\nEuropean countries would become\nmore intricate and complicated,\nposing a serious economical threat\nto the country.\nIn addition, by leaving such an\norganization, the UK would be\nrenouncing a great amount of power\nand in\ufb02uence in the world that it\nprobably wouldn\u2019t manage to have\nalone.

The government\n\u2018NHS Choices\u2019 website, designed\nto inform the public about available\ntreatments, offers only indirect\ncriticism.\nIt has now emerged that a charity\nset-up by Charles lobbied the\nDepartment of Health to alter the\ntext of the NHS Choices guidance\non Homeopathy. The initial draft\nstressed the lack of scientific\nevidence, saying: \u201cFurthermore, if\nthe principles of homeopathy were\ntrue it would violate all the existing\ntheories of science that we make\nuse of today; not just our theory\nof medicine, but also chemistry,\nbiology and physics.\u201d\nBut writer David Mattin has\nsince resigned, stating that the\ngovernment had \u201csold out the NHS\nChoices editorial team\u201d and \u201cfailed\nthe public.\u201d\nReleased documents show\nsomeone in the department asked\nMattin\u2019s references to a House Politics Editor\n\u201c\n\u201cHopefully this\u2019ll\nkeep those UKIP\nsods off my back...\u201d\nNews in brief from around the world\nof Commons report stating that\nHomeopathy is no more effective\nthan a placebo be removed as they\nare \u201ccontentious\u201d and \u201cmay well\nbe subject to challenge from the\nHomeopathic community\u201d.\nPossibility of Talks in Syria\nThe leader of the opposition Syrian\nNational Council, Moaz al-Khatib,\nis due to visit Moscow soon, amid\nthe possibility of talks between the\nopposition leaders and the Assad\nregime.

    "content": "NEWS\n4 FRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\nNews Editors: Aemun\nReza, Nida Mahmud\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nhe Royal Institution (RI), one of the\nchief catalysts for the development\nof British science, has put its Mayfair residence on the market in an effort to overwrite mounting debts. Sir\nRichard Sykes, the current Chairman\nand former Rector of Imperial College\nLondon, has had to take swift action\nto remedy institutional losses. hese\nwere in excess of \u00a3600,000 in the 2012\nacademic year.\nhis \ufb01gure is dwarfed by the staggering \u00a32.6 million of losses incurred\nin 2010, mainly due to an expensive\nrenovation of the building.\nhe priority has been identi\ufb01ed as\nthe generation of short-term cash \ufb02ow.\nIn a recently published article in he\nGuardian Sir Richard Sykes identi\ufb01ed the urgent need to replenish the\norganisation\u2019s endowment by \u00a37.5 mil-lion; however there have been insuf\ufb01cient acts of philanthropy thus far,\nwith Sir Richard saying: \u201cSupport and\no\ufb00ers of help for the Royal Institution\nhave been welcome, but must now be\nconverted into action \u2013 and income.\u201d\nMany believe that the repercussions\nwould extend far beyond the inconvenience of having to move premises.\nAs cited by Lisa Jardine, a former RI\ntrustee and professor of Renaissance\nStudies at University College London,\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the [scienti\ufb01c]\nequivalent of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe.\u201d\nMany would agree, arguing that the\nRI is representative of the a\ufb03nity between science and society; the two\nare inextricably linked. It cannot be\ndenied that scienti\ufb01c discovery has always been fuelled, \ufb01rst and foremost,\nby research and hypothesis. In spite of\nthis many believe that without passion\nfew scientists would have persevered\nin order to reach closure in their \ufb01eld\nof work. he Christmas Lectures, facilitated by the RI, are perfect evidence\nof this, with recent success boosting\nviewing \ufb01gures to four million in the\nUK, opening science to a wider audi-ence.\nSome are concerned that the ambiance created by the RI \u201cbrand\u201d could\nGive us your fooookin\u2019 money, says Sir Richard Sykes\npublic eye, saying: \u201cIn my opinion, this\nis our opportunity to create a national\nstrategy for science communication,\nadvocacy and public engagement if we\nwant Britain to be the best place in the\nworld to do science.\u201d Questions will\nstill remain over whether mismanagement has occurred. For now, the building is still up for sale unless funds are\nfound from another source.\ndie with the sale of the premises. For\nscienti\ufb01c research to continue to grow\nit must have new recruits; the Royal\nInstitution is frequently identi\ufb01ed as a\nkey life-line for this. In this spirit highly regarded \ufb01gures of the British Scienti\ufb01c community have united to \ufb01ght\nfor the RI\u2019s cause. Robert Winston of\nImperial College London currently\nchairs the recently established Future\nDirection Committee. heir cause\nis bolstered by the public support of\nprominent physicists Brian Cox and\nJim Al-Khalili. he latter has commented that, \u201cIt seems crazy that at a\ntime when science and science communication is riding a wave of popularity not seen for generations, we hear\nthat the very epitome of a British scienti\ufb01c institution is under threat.\u201d\nIt is clear to see that the controversy\nextends beyond the \ufb01nancial di\ufb03culties faced by the Royal Institution,\nextending right to the heart of British\nscienti\ufb01c legacy.\nSir Richard Sykes believes that the\ncurrent issue could help to initiate the\nprocess of science being heavily in the\nMTV Cribs\non steroids\nEoghan J Totten Reporter\nRoyal Institution forced to sell home\nthe campaign run by students to save\nthe TSU; the second was that regardless of the outcome of the current con-sultation, the Union wants the College\nto say why the TSU is being closed and\nhow the students will be supported.\nhe \ufb01rst motion received 21 votes\nfor, 4 votes against and 8 abstentions;\nthe motion was therefore passed. he\nsecond motion also passed. Hence,\nthe Union will be supporting the TSU\nstudents in their campaign to save the\nTSU.\nhe paper was presented by representatives of the TSU and the discussion was lengthy. he Management\nBoard, who are a decision making\nbody composed of senior sta\ufb00 at Imperial College London, made the decision to close or rehouse the Unit. he\nreason for the decision is unclear to\nstudents, who have been informed that\nthe teaching quality is \u201chigh\u201d in the\ndepartment and has been evaluated\nas an \u201cexcellent\u201d department by other\nuniversities. Furthermore, the TSU is a\npro\ufb01table department. Without proper supervision in place, there could\nalso be implications for PhD students\noutside the TSU as students from\nother departments also use the TSU\nto translate papers. he MSc o\ufb00ered\nby the department is the only Masters\nprogramme in the UK that focuses on\ntranslation within \u201cscienti\ufb01c, technical\nand medical\u201d areas.\nhe debate started with Michael Foster, Council Chair, reminded everyone\n\u201cthe e\ufb00ect on current students\u201d is what\ncan be discussed, and the impact to future students or sta\ufb00 is not the remit\nof the Council. he representatives of\nthe TSU commented that they do not\nknow how they will be able to continue\nwithout supervisors, College responded that this has not been decided yet.\nOther comments made by the TSU include the fact that the decision about\nStrategy was before a big strategic\nreview. It was then the suggested the\nstudent input that is being asked for in\na survey about strategy for Education\nand Student experience has no use, as\nthe decision to close the TSU has already been passed.\nA TSU representative also commented that their degree was devalued as a\nresult of this, putting their careers in\njeopardy and exposing them to the risk\nof losing their scholarships. Paul Beaumont, Union President, said there were\n\u201cno facts\u201d to back this up. Additionally,\nthe TSU commented it \u201cSeems like\nDebra [Humphris, Pro-Rector (Edu-cation)] has given us no options\u201d. he\nrepresentatives also said that they believed that it is \u201cirresponsible to do a\nconsultation now and not in the summer before [the College] enrolled us\u201d.\nDuring the meeting it was also noted\nthat History of Science, which was also\nmoved, had a similar situation, where\nthey were not given much information\nand moved without much consulta-tion. However, that issue was never\nbrought to Council.\nBecky Lane, Deputy President (Wel-fare), cited the possibility of an unknown strategy and said that she \u201cvery\nstrongly thinks forward planning and\n\ufb01nancial reasons\u201d are the reason.\nOn the 18 December 2012, the Head\nof the TSU was informed \u201cthat the College Management Board has decided\nthat TSU activities are not considered\ncore to College strategy and that the\nUnit should be transferred to another\ninstitution. If this solution is not feasible then consideration will be given\nto discontinuing translation studies\nfrom the 1st October 2013.\u201d Sta\ufb00 and\nstudents were also informed that there\nwill be a 30 day consultation period for\nthe sta\ufb00 from 18 January.\nhe TSU currently accommodates\n96 students; 50 are MSc students, 22\nare PhDs, 16 are UCL students and 6\nare undergraduates.\nhe online petition has received\nover 6000 signatures, but more are\nstill needed. he support has been on\na Global level. Irene Ranzato, an English Translation teacher at Sapienza\nUniversity in Rome commented that\nthe TSU ay Imperial \u201cis considered\nby teachers, researchers and students\nalike a fundamental point of reference\nfor our studies. For those who study\nLinguistics and Translation, Imperial\nCollege is synonymous with Translation Studies.\u201d Gianluigi Desogus, from\nPortugal enrolled in 2001, the year the\nMSc was launched; she said \u201cI\u2019ve been\nworking in translation ever since, initially in-house and as a freelancer later.\nI couldn\u2019t have done it without the skills\nI picked up thanks to this excellent\ncourse. I\u2019d be extremely sad to see the\nMSc leave Imperial College\u2019s exciting\nenvironment. Please reconsider your\ndecision!\u201d here has also been support\nfrom across the Atlantic, Sonia Murray\nfrom California emphasised \u201cscienti\ufb01c\nprogress is essential to the well-being\nof humans everywhere, but communicating the impact of discoveries in a\nway that is easily grasped by the public\nat large is often di\ufb03cult for scientists,\neven in their own language. he ability\nto transmit new knowledge is a critical ingredient of humanity\u2019s progress.\nWe need translators with a focus on\ntechnical and scienti\ufb01c areas to ensure\nthe transmission of accurate scienti\ufb01c\ninformation, which has the power to\ngenerate new discoveries.\u201d\nCollege have no updates on the situation until the end of the consultation\nperiod.\nCollege to be pressured to explain the decision\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nIdellyic summertime shot.\nNow you\u2019ve had a good stare,\nget back to reading the article.\nImperial College London\nEditorial, page 2\n>>\n\n"

    "content": "Welcome to the insane asylum\nPopulation:Ross Webster\nt has been a long time since\nmy brain has hurt this much.\nI\u2019ve just worked out how to\nreach the bottom of an endless staircase, and now I\u2019m\nfaced with a laser puzzle that needs\n30 pieces, when I\u2019ve only got 12, and\nI can\u2019t even move them around. Welcome to Antichamber.\nImagine a game like Portal, where\nyou have to complete puzzles to reach\nthe next room, but where your path\nto the end of the game isn\u2019t linear,\nnor is how you complete each cham-ber. Instead of placing portals around\nthe level, you can instead pick up and\nplace brightly coloured blocks \u2013 think\nof them as mini Minecraft blocks if it\nhelps. So far, this description would\nmake for a Portal-esque game; you\u2019ve\ngot a mission, a gun that helps you get\naround the game, and some puzzles\nthrown in. hat\u2019s not all Antichamber is, however \u2013 if Escher could have\nmade a video game \u2013 I feel it would\nbe a lot like this. For example, say you\nare walking along a corridor, turning 90 degrees to your right, every 5\nmetres, with no incline. hen, after\ndoing this 10 times, the corridor suddenly becomes straight when you turn\nthe corner. Being an FPS, it\u2019s weird to\nknow that your mind is being tricked\nquite easily, yet you don\u2019t see how or\nwhere it happened.\nhe artistic style of Antichamber\nmakes you feel like you\u2019re trapped in\na modern art museum, with pristine\nwhite walls, ceilings and \ufb02oor. Little motivational images are posted\naround the game \u2013 often giving subtle\nhints as to how you should approach\nthe next chamber. here\u2019s sporadic use\nof colour in some areas \u2013 you may go\nthrough multiple white-walled cham-bers, before coming across a large\nroom, where you need to make your\nway to the end, using the coloured\ncorridor sections as a guide.\nOnce you\u2019ve learned the tricks of\ntrade, and know what to expect, the\ngame will then throw something obvious into the mix, and stump you for\nanother good 5 minutes before you\nfacepalm, and wonder why you even\nthought it would be good to procrastinate this way.\nhe block-play isn\u2019t too repetitive either \u2013 there are upgrades available to\nyour launcher that make older puzzles\nquicker to run through, and new puz-zles, managable.\nAs soundtracks go, Antichamber\u2018s\nmay not be as odd as you think \u2013 it\u2019s\nnot your normal game OST, with a\nthematic motif... or any emotion \u2013 it\u2019s\njust sounds. Relaxing sounds at least.\nI expect that if they added anything\nmore energetic, there\u2019d be more temper tantrums than usual. Being made\nin the Unreal engine, the graphics look\n\ufb01ne and will work on any relatively recent and decent laptop, although you\nmight \ufb01nd there are some issues with\nthe screen resolution (nothing too had\ntoo \ufb01x with notepad).\nhere\u2019s not much, in terms of replay-ability, as a lot of the \u2018fun\u2019 is from not\nknowing what to do. here\u2019s a timer\nin the menu room, that counts down\nfrom 1hr 30min, so at least you\u2019ll be\nable to speedrun the game...\nIt\u2019s available on Steam for \u00a314.99 \u2013\nand I can\u2019t see any reason, why after this\ngreat success, we wouldn\u2019t see a 360 or\nPS3 version. With DLC though. :(\nI\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\nValve games into films? Sign me up!\nLaurence Pope I want to believe\nIt has to be said that films based\non video games don\u2019t tend to get\ncritically praised. Browsing Wikipedia shows that the highest Rotten Tomatoes score one has ever\nachieved is 43%, which is less than\nimpressive. They are not, in gen-eral, the kind of films I pay to see.\nBut things might well change.\nCue J.J. Abrams\u2019 production company Bad Robot and Valve coming\ntogether to make films based upon\nValve\u2019s game series Half-Life and\nPortal. The announcement was\nmade at the end of a keynote speech\ndelivered by Abrams and Valve\u2019s\nco-founder and CEO Gabe Newell,\nentitled \u201cStorytelling Across Platforms: Who Benefits Most, the Audience or the Player?\u201d. The speech,\npart of the 2013 D.I.C.E (Design,\nInnovate, Communicate, Entertain) summit, took the form of a\ndiscussion between the two men\nas they talked about the strengths\nand weaknesses of films and video\ngames as storytelling mediums.\nPreviously other Hollywood directors have approached Valve\nabout making a Half-Life film; in\nNewell\u2019s words, \u201c\u2026their stories\nwere just so bad. I mean, brutally,\nthe worst. Not understanding what\nmade the game a good game, or\nwhat made the property an interesting thing for people to be a fan\nof.\u201d Up until this point Valve had\nconsidered making their own HL\nfilm in order to do the series jus-tice, and their work with the Team\nFortress 2 \u2018Meet the Team\u2019 shorts\nwas part of the experimentation\nprocess. The joint announcement\nby Abrams and Newell seem set to\nchange this idea.\nSo when can we expect some-thing? Though much talk has no\ndoubt gone on between Newell and\nAbrams there\u2019s still little in the way\nof concrete information available\nto the public. Like all things Valve\nundertakes the project will take\ntime, so don\u2019t expect a 2013 release\n(or even a 2014 one). Good things\ncome to those who wait, however,\nand I for one am confident whatever Valve and Bad Robot Productions come up with will trump all\nthe other video game movies in the\nmarket.\nI guess Episode 3 can just wait a\nlittle longer\u2026\nMy money. All of it.\nTake.\nMaybe there would be an\nAvengers-esque movie after\nall the separate films. They\ncould fight an EA invasion.\nCircus of\ngames news\nNot a waste of our time?\nInXile have shown us a good bunch\nof gameplay footage of their alpha\nbuild for Wasteland 2. Despite the UI\nlooking like it\u2019s from the 90s, the in-game graphics are promising, and the\ngameplaylooksverysolid.Thisshould\nstop some of the worrying that\u2019s been\ngoing on in Kickstarter-backer-land.\nBatman Arkham Again\nThose lovely people at Warner Bros.\nhas confirmed that there\u2019ll be a new\nBatman game coming out this year.\nWe don\u2019t know a title, nor if London\ndeveloper Rocksteady is still on the\ncase \u2013 we\u2019ll let you know when were\nupdated.\nCome back when you get\nsome money, buddy.\n32\n\n"

    "content": "Electricity and Bubbles\nSCIENCE\nYou met the DeskJet, now meet the DrugJet\nPhilip Kent Science Editor\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\nEveryone has heard of the inkjet print-er, you probably have one yourself.\nHowever, one application of the venerable o\ufb03ce supply you haven\u2019t heard\nof is printing drugs, recently developed at the UCL School of Pharmacy.\nAn inkjet printer works by delivering small droplets of ink onto the\npage, controlled via an electrical sig-nal. In most inkjet printers a thermal\ntechnique is used: heat vapourizes\nink, which is then delivered onto the\npage and dried. A mixture of the colours (and black) are used to produce\nthe desired output on page.\nIn this development, the same thermal process has been used to deliver\nthe drug carbamazepine, a medication\noften prescribed to people su\ufb00ering\nfrom epilepsy.\nhe original synthetic method for\nthis drug involves delivery of a tiny\namount of the drug. When deposited,\nthe drug evaporates and crystallises\nalmost immediately, producing the\ndesired compound.\nIn this new technique, the same\nmethod is used, but an inkjet printer\nis used to precisely control drug deliv-ery. his makes use of the \ufb01ne control\nthat inkjet cartridges have when deploying ink, with many inkjet printers\ncapable of printing to 1,200 dpi.\nhe main advantage of using printers is their ease of conversion to printing drugs, which also has the desirable\nquality of being cheap to do. A good\nquantity of crystallisation has also\nbeen reported, with even better yields\nlowing bubbles from\nsoapy water has been a\nfavourite past time for\nall of us. Struggling as\nwe try to catch them before the breeze takes them higher and\nhigher provided us with hours of de-light. We never gave a thought to the\nphysics behind it, because, well, that\nwould ruin the fun.\nBubbles usually do not last for too\nlong, and if we had restrained ourselves enough, we would have seen\nthem pulled back under gravity by\ntheir own weight. It\u2019s true, bubbles\ndo have a mass (a very small one at\nthat). Bubbles are a good example of\nnano\ufb02uids; \ufb02uids with a thickness of\nthe order of nanometres. Research has\nbeen going on in the area of micro\ufb02uids and nano\ufb02uids, with the challenge\nof driving \ufb02ows through ever smaller\nchannels.\nA research group from the University of Lyon have looked into the elec-trokinetic properties of soft, deform-able nano\ufb02uids, with some surprising\nresults. Soap \ufb01lms were the \ufb02uid of\nchoice for the team because they are\neasy to produce, nanometres thick\nand are a perfect balance between liquid pressure and surface tension. he\nexperiment consisted of balancing a\ncylinder of the \ufb02uid between two platinum coated glass electrodes. he \ufb01lm\nis protected from evaporation by hermetically sealing in a water saturated\natmosphere.\nApplying a small potential di\ufb00erence between the closely spaced electrodes (5.5mm) caused a large electric\n\ufb01eld to be created within the bubble,\naltering its thickness and \ufb02ow rate.\nBefore passing a current through it,\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s thickness and conductance\nis recorded, and once energised, the\nconductance to a plateau after around\n100s, due to the conducting surface\nbecoming saturated. his provided a\ncalibration method to infer the thickness of the \ufb02uid from its conductivity.\nhe second stage was to swap the\nAC supply for a constant DC one, in\nthe same direction as gravity. he result was a net movement of \ufb02uid from\nbottom to top, against the pull of grav-ity, a phenomenon known as electro-osmosis. Interestingly, a change in colour in the bubble was observed when\nthe electric \ufb01eld was changed rapidly,\nas the \ufb01lm\u2019s walls fattened quickly. By\nsolving the resulting equations, taking\ninto account gravitational, electrical\nand viscous forces, the team concluded that the thickness of the bubble is\nformed in equilibrium from the electricity and capillary suction. he team\nalso note: \u201cAdapting this study to a real\nfoam structure with \ufb01lms, nodes, and\nplateau borders is a great challenge in\norder to use this phenomenon in real\nsystems.\u201d\nSo, spare a thought for this subtle balancing act next time you see a\nlonely bubble \ufb02oating in the sky.\nPavitar Devgon asks what ever could go wrong...\nB\nThis bubble is brought to you through\nthe power of electricity... or printing\nbeing achieved when multiple passes\nhave been used.\nhis development is not completely\nwithout its \ufb02aws, however, with certain solvents having the potential to\nwreck havoc with the cartridge ma-terial. Common solvents used, water\nand water/ethanol mixtures, are \ufb01ne,\nThe new drug baron? Stringer\nBell better watch out...\nhowever other commonly used solvents may cause more trouble.\nDOI: 10.1039/c2ce26519b\n\n"

If you\u2019ve never read\nLeveraged Sell Out, this will probably\nbe the most pro-banking piece you\u2019ve\never encountered.\nTo me, the draw to \ufb01nance was\nnever really about money. I do agree\nwith Billing\u2019s points about the cul-ture, but I think it\u2019s painted a little\ntoo extreme. My own experience\nwithin investment banking is that\nwhile this culture of excess and living far outside your means exists, it\u2019s\ncertainly not the case for everybody. I\nwould say that far from people being\nridiculed for frugality as you might\nimagine would happen, the most irresponsible spenders are sometimes\nviewed in a negative light by some of\ntheir colleagues. Sure, there\u2019s a lot of\nmoney \ufb02ying around, but in the places I know well, I can\u2019t think of a single\nperson who is 10x leveraged. I have\nto admit that this is likely to be more\ncommon in the senior ranks, as people try to maintain their three cars,\nhuge rent payments, private school\nfor their kids and so on, but certainly\nfor the analysts (who make up most\nof the \u2018culture\u2019 of the \ufb01rm you\u2019ll really see as an intern or recent gradu-ate), even 0.2-0.3x leverage would be\nquite extreme. Many do start hitting\nthe credit cards as bonus season ap-proaches, which is obviously a dreadful idea from the viewpoint of \ufb01scal\nresponsibility, but this is usually as\nbad as it gets. he big spenders live\nlavishly, but within their (substantial)\nmeans.\nRegardless of this, I do not believe\nanyone who will end up getting a\nreturn o\ufb00er from their internship,\nor more de\ufb01nitively, not get axed in\ntheir \ufb01rst two years, is driven solely\nby money. When you realise at 3am\nthat all the assumptions driving your\nmodel are wrong and that it\u2019s pretty\nunlikely you\u2019re going to sleep tonight,\nit\u2019s not the thought of that bonus in a\nyear that keeps you going. It\u2019s a passion for what you do, and the huge\nsense of responsibility on your shoul-ders.\nOne of the strongest reasons for\nF\nRoss Gray provides a retort to last week\u2019s article about banking\nme to pursue a career in investment\nbanking is the sheer\nlevel of responsibility given to an\nanalyst. Let\u2019s face\nit, in every graduate\nscheme you\u2019re going to be doing the\nmost boring work\nin the organisation\nfor at least two or\nthree years; as far\nas I\u2019m aware, there\u2019s\nno magical job that\nlets you immediately\nstart running accounts or deals, or\nmaking important\ndecisions (except\nyour own business\nof course). he difference between\nbanking and some\nof these other jobs is\nthat while you may\nbe the bottom of the\nladder, and occasionally feel under-appreciated, you\u2019re\nstill absolutely key\nto the deal. It\u2019s likely\nthat you built the\nvaluation (an important part of the\nservice o\ufb00ered in\ninvestment banking)\ncompletely from\nscratch with little help or outside intervention and nobody, not even the\npeople more senior than you, understands it as well as you do. You might\nbe doing the Excel work instead of\nbrokering the deal and being involved\nin high pressure negotiations, but this\nwork is still absolutely critical to the\ndeal closing. If your model is wrong\nsomehow on a live deal, this could not\nonly lead to the complete collapse of\nthe deal but potential lawsuits and\nscandals. I can\u2019t think of many other\ncareer paths where someone could\nderail a transaction worth billions of\ndollars in their \ufb01rst year.\nI think a common problem for\nthose trying to consider the mindset\nof those of us who choose this career\npath is that they don\u2019t understand\nthat to us, this is not boring. I can\u2019t\nspeak for every undergraduate with\nan internship, but I can assure you,\nmergers and acquisitions, leveraged\nbuy outs, hostile takeovers and issues\nof corporate governance are in\ufb01nitely\nmore interesting to me than plasma\nphysics or synthetic chemistry.\nI didn\u2019t have my heart set on physics then get to university and think\n\u201cWait, instead of doing something I\nlove for not very much money, I can\ndo something I absolutely despise for\n100 hours a week for a good salary and\na hefty bonus? Sign me up!\u201d To me,\nthe reasons to do banking seem analogous to those for coming to Imperial. Why did most people come here\nspeci\ufb01cally, instead of, say, a slightly\nless respected university where they\nwouldn\u2019t be worked to death? We\nwant to learn as much as possible. We\nwant the best exit opportunities after-wards. Why are we willing to work so\nintensely to achieve these goals? Perhaps it\u2019s because regardless of where\nwe\u2019re going afterwards, most of us are\nstill, or were at some stage, incredibly\npassionate about our subject. Perhaps\nwe just love working hard in general.\nSo next time you go to ridicule your\nfriend for being a sell-out when they\ntext you from their desk at 5am, think\nthrough why they might be there.\nNobody is claiming that \ufb01nance is\nsome magical land where you\u2019ll be\nperpetually happy and there are no\nproblems at all. Every path has its\ndi\ufb03culties and its victories, and in\n\ufb01nance these moments tend to be\nrather bipolar, with the worst moments being utterly dreadful, but\nthe best moments being some of the\nmost satisfying I have experienced. At\nthe very core of it, that\u2019s why, despite\nrarely leaving the o\ufb03ce before 1am,\nbeing perpetually tired, often ill, and\nsometimes a little downtrodden, I still\nremain passionate about investment\nbanking and look forward to starting\nmy full time job in the summer. If you\ncan\u2019t understand this at all, then follow Mr. Billing\u2019s advice: please do not\ngo into \ufb01nance, you will hate it. But if\nthis means anything to you, if in some\nweird way you love it when you\u2019re\nforced to pull an all-nighter for a lab\nreport, then forget the money and put\nsome serious consideration into a career in \ufb01nance.\n\u201c\nWhen you realise at 3am...\nthat it\u2019s pretty unlikely\nyou\u2019re going\nto sleep to-night, it\u2019s not\nthe thought\nof that bonus\nin a year that\nkeeps you\ngoing\nAaniya Ahmed\n\n"

It is an important event for\nthose who are involved with the Arts on\ncampus. he show, which is planned to\ncoincide with Imperial College\u2019s festival\nof art, music and dance, features collaboration between members of Leonardo\nFine Arts Society and Photographic Society. Some reader might remember the\nmaze of string last year or the \ufb02ock of\npaper cranes the year before.\nBeing a spectator over the past few\nyears allowed me to marvel at the\nachievement of people who managed to\nput these breath-taking, genuinely innovative exhibitions up. As part of the LeoSoc committee last year I had a glimpse\nof the managerial e\ufb00ort it required. his\nyear the job \ufb01nally fell to me, there was a\nlot to live up to.\nHerding cats is a polite way to describe\nthe task of encouraging artists to produce work. When you add photographers to the mix things start to get really\ntricky. Disasters, miscommunications\nand frankly fuck-ups are bound to hap-pen; in fact I believe they are important\nfacets of the creative process. By that\nmeasure this year should be a roaring\nsuccess.\nhe \ufb01rst round of creative ideas was\nforged, as all good ideas are, in the pub.\nEvery Monday LeoSoc gathers for a few\nrefreshing pints and we persuaded some\nphotographers to tag along. I started\nencouraging the regular photographers\nand artists who attend our bar nights to\nshare their ideas.\nTrying to understand the vision of\na fellow artist can be a surreal journey,\nmore so when it comes to sharing your\nown. Bits of paper or the surface of an\niPad become a conduit to illustrate different concepts. Initial rampant, creative\noutbursts lead to compulsive googling\nof that installation you remember having seen or that cool image you saw in\nsomeone\u2019s deviant art\u2019s pro\ufb01le. Soon af-terwards, the voices of pragmatism rise,\nnot in short supply at this university, and\ncry out to bring all those ideas down to\nearth. hen follows the fuss over where\nto procure kilometres of wool, or hundreds of LEDs or where to buy a few\nthousands polystyrene cubes.\nDay-dreaming continued while deadlines loomed and in my head a warning\nlight began to pulse as the day-to-day\nrunning of the society started chewing\nup my time and spitting out bones. I\nneeded to put something together now.\nIdeas, once decided started to transform\nagain and after a brief meeting with Photosoc a new feasible idea sprung out.\nTime is ticking but the aim was clear\nnow. I was to get sixteen painters from\nLeoSoc to paint a piece each. I had to\nstart making calls to gather the \ufb01rst\ngroup of painters, then call CassArt to\nensure there were enough canvases in\nstock. I received an image from the photographers that we were to paint.\nhis is the part where the fun really started, bohemian scenes of intense\npainting sessions and banging tunes in\nsuccession, by the start of the week we\nalready had ten paintings.\nHanging day arrives; we still do not\nhave all the paintings but plenty to get\nstarted. Showing the paintings to PhotoSoc it dawns on me that there has been\na massive communications breakdown,\nour paintings were not what they are ex-pecting.\nhe ability to improvise and make of\nthe mishap a source of inspiration is one\nof the things that I adore about this job.\nFortunately the very way we had conceived the exhibition, in terms of pixels,\nhelped form an idea to salvage the exhi-bition. As ever the last minute change\nproves more interesting than the original plan.\nAs I write, some paintings are still in\nthe making and the prints are coming\ntomorrow but I feel positive. he paintings look outstanding and a few people\nhave already asked if they are for sale.\nIf you as curious about the end of this\nstory as me, the show opens next week\nhere will be wine and you can meet all\nthose that put the show together by pulling it out of a spin dive at the last minute.\nOpening party on Febuary 19th 8pm,\nBlythe Gallery, Sherfield Level 5\nRoc\u00edo Molina Writer\nFacebook shrubs\nfeatures literal wall\nEva Rosenthal Arts Editor\nBack to\ncollage\nKurt Schwitters was a key in\ufb02uence on\nthe development of pop-art, one of the\nmost important movements of the 20th\ncentury, but if you have never heard his\nname before, do not fear. Tate Britain is\nhaving a major retrospective of his work\nand, in any case, it is a catchy name, with\na tingling ring to it that sticks delightfully\nto your brain walls so that you could \ufb01nd\nyourself Schwittering (muttering Schwitters to yourself whilst trying to look sane)\naround the sweltering rooms the Tate\nBritian.\nSchwitters, a member of the avant-garde art scene in the 20s and 30s, driven\nto Britain in 1941 by the Nazis, must\nbe introduced through his collages and\nthrough the theory that pervades his\nwork: Merz. his was the belief that any\nmaterial was as valid and as valuable as\npaint for the creation of a work of art.\nTicket stubs, magazines, porridge and\nhalf-spoons were all used by Schwitters\nto create his subtle and delicate collages.\nhese are by far the most beautiful\nthings he made. hey are delicate, intricate and often funny \u2013 although always\nmelancholic. hose collages, made as\nhe was nearing the end of his life in the\ndeepest Lake District, are especially love-ly, abstract representations of the natural\nworld.\nHe worked best in miniature. His small\npieces are charming, allowing the viewer\nto swiftly imbibe the feeling of the work.\nSchwitters\u2019 larger works however, are\ndull, plodding creatures. His portraits\nand landscapes are unimaginative and\nheavy: everyone runs past them without\neven meaning to. Enthusiastic art students attempt to glue themselves to the\ngallery \ufb02oor in front of his abstract paintings but are quickly distracted; even they\ncannot manage to give them more than a\nminute of their time.\nSchwitters was an artist with various\ninterests, dabbling in experimental po-etry, he was proli\ufb01c writer. In the context\nof the show, what stood out for me were\nhis views on imitation in art. Imitation\nin his (simpli\ufb01ed) view could not result\nin anything truly worthy and for him, at\nleast, this was true: his \ufb01nest works, his\ncollages, were also truly original.\n\n"

To me, there\nis nothing more\nenlightening than\nthrashing out some\np o l i t i c a l\np h i l o s o - phy,\nlooking at\nissues from\ndi\ufb00erent per-spectives, amending your way of thinking or even dropping it\nand searching for a new\none. his is not a weak\ncompromise \u2013 it is enriching your understanding of\nthe world through debate\nwhich helps build a better\nand coherent way to view\nand deal with it.\nLast week a rare but\ndelightful oddity oc-curred. Democracy.\nhe Government\nand Opposition did not\norder MPs how t o vote,\nbut allowed them to make their\nown decision. As the dust settled,\nan overwhelming cry of support for\ngay marriage was heard. Despite being glad with this outcome, I was a\ntad frustrated. My\ngrudge does not lie\nwith those for voting against it generally,\nas the discussion over\nwhether marriage is\na religious or civil\ninstitution is a valid\none, but with those\npeople who use faith to wrap up their\ndiscriminatory view that homosexuals are in some way inferior. Yes, the\nConservative party was\nsplit on the vote and I\nwould not be surprised\nif a good number of those\nwere guilty of my accusations.\nHowever, I imagine that a good number of the Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs were equally culpable.\nhere is no place for such neanderthals in any political party. hank-fully, if they do not evolve, they will\nperish.\nhese fossils are the sort which\nmakes people associate the Conservative party with wanting\nto keep things as they are, or\nturn the clock back. With an ever\nchanging social environment, such\ntraits are clearly evolutionarily dis-advantageous. However, the Tories\nhave been consistently evolving, the\nradicals leading the party accepting\narguments for change that are for\nthe betterment of society, with the\nneanderthals passing away into the\nmists of time. David Cameron was\na Leader that night. He championed\na tolerant, fair future that the previous Government did not. However,\nunless the rest of the Conservative\ncreature advances with him, they\nwill drag his Premiership into extinction at the next election. he history books will not remember him\nas a leader but only as the reforming\nfounder of the new Conservatives.

Ears ringing with\nassertions that we should play defensively and win with superior numbers\nbehind the ball, we had a good warm\nup and prepared to play running into\nstrong wind.\nWith one or two early forays into\nICHC Ladies 1s battle UCL rivals\nUCL\u2019s defensive half, we quickly discovered that actually following advice and playing the way that Oli had\nwanted us to all season paid some\ndividends as we were able to capitalise\non UCL\u2019s mistakes. he other side of\nthis was that play was 90% in our own\nhalf of the pitch, with defence under\nconstant pressure to keep UCL out.\nKeeping up with some of the more\nboisterous UCL forwards was tricky,\nand the defending mids and forwards\nlooked a bit lost, but our defensive line\nwas rock-solid, keeping out repeated\nlong and short-corners, even a couple of passable attempts at drag-\ufb02icks\n(she managed to get it in the air and\ntowards the goal).\nSu\ufb00ering bruised feet and barely-working lungs at the back, it was with\nmuch relief that mids and forwards\ngot used to defending and organisation fell into place, leaving UCL continuously frustrated in their attacking\ne\ufb00orts.\nhe score at 0-0, we emerged from a\nfreezing half-time talk determined to\nkeep up the good work and discipline.\nWith UCL now playing into the wind\nand rain, we got more aggressive, and\nmore balls made it out to forwards\nHayley and Sorcha. Despite best ef-forts, they were unable to run through\noppo defence on their own and our\nstrategy showed it\u2019s weaknesses with\nUCL continuing to dominate pres-sure, though not possession, in our\nhalf. One particularly interesting attack saw a slow lob heading for the\nnet over keeper Purcy\u2019s head, but was\ndenied with a \u201cgraceful\u201d vertical jump\nthat saw the ball knocked o\ufb00 the back\nline from near the crossbar.\nShowing that we were still in this\ngame, IC did manage to get the ball\nup the pitch and Hazman capitalised\non UCL\u2019s bored and frozen defence to\nachieve a de\ufb02ection o\ufb00 of their stick,\nand into the goal over their keepers\nhead. Our elation was short-lived.\nWith a crack in our disciplined play,\nUCL made it back into our half and\ngot o\ufb00 a cracking shot from top D into\nthe far corner of the net before defence or keeper could react. Both sides\nstruggled for goal attempts in the remaining minutes, but the whistle went\nbefore our attacking short could be\nblown, and the game \ufb01nished 1-1.\nhough disappointed that we had\nnot kept them out entirely, we impressed ourselves with one of the best\ngames we\u2019ve played this season, and\ncertainly the most disciplined. his\nwas re\ufb02ected in MoM nominations for\nnearly every player, though ultimately\nawarded to left-back Emma. With a\nwin, loss and now a draw behind us,\nwe hope to beat UCL convincingly if\nwe meet them again in the LUSL cup\n\ufb01nal. his rivalry needs to be sorted\nonce and for all!\nBUCS Cup Semi-Finals for ICSM Netball!\nAfter winning the BUCS South-Eastern conference cup 2 years ago and\nlosing out last year to the dubious\nways of Royal Holloway, this year\u2019s\nsemi-\ufb01nal against Brighton 2s (away)\nhad a lot riding on it. he journey to\nthe idyllic retirement village of Eastbourne where Brighton students reside was challenge enough, but the\nlong journey just added to our determination for coming away with a vic-tory. We had a \u2018nothing can stop us\u2019\nattitude and were ready for any challenge that might await us.\nOn arrival, we were confronted by a\nteam larger \u2013 mainly in height \u2013 than\nany we have come across in London.\nhe average height of the team was at\nleast 6ft, but we have shown through\nour successes that height isn\u2019t every-thing. We knew that we were going to\nhave to use our skill and speed though\nthe court to transfer the ball e\ufb00ectively through the court.\nBrighton came out stronger than\nwe expected and we were only able\nto hold down a 2 goal lead at the end\nof the \ufb01rst quarter. We took our time\nto settle into the game and allowed\nBrighton to get the better of us, pushing us o\ufb00 the ball and being more\nphysical than expected. Stepping up\nto the Brighton\u2019s physicality we managed to really pull away in the following 2 quarters, with the shooters capi-talising on every opportunity, despite\npersistent foul play from the desperate Brighton defence. Our WD, Emma\nWilliamson, with her speed and agility\nhad some great turnovers in the centre court interrupting their attacking play, allowing us to gain a 39-27\nlead heading into the \ufb01nal quarter\nof the game. he challenge was then\nto maintain the intensity of play and\nclose out for a well deserved victory\nagainst 7 angry giants for the remaining 15 minutes.\nCongratulations to the team for\npulling together \u2013 a combination of\ngreat movement and perfect shooting\nin attack, pin point accurate feeding\ninto the circle and the defence standing strong, holding space resulted\nin a \ufb01nal score of 50-37. With this\nfantasitic win we are now through to\nthe semis! Now to get our revenge on\nRoyal Holloway...\nLindsay Hennah Sports Writer\nJessica Purcell Sports Writer\n\n"

Edward Courtnell, Stephen Rose and Dominik\nSznajder are now facing teams from\nOxford, Strathclyde and Glasgow\nUniversities for the chance to win\na 2-week trip on a BP oil rig in the\nNorth Sea and a cash prize of \u00a31000.\nhe group of friends went from regular term work of solving problem\nsheets and revising for progress tests,\nto climbing up the ladder and impressing BP executives at last week\u2019s\nSemi-Final.\nhe BP Ultimate Field Trip is a\n\ufb02agship competition not just in the\nUK but all over the world. It gives\nstudents the opportunity to have a\ngo at tackling real-life engineering\nchallenges and to come up with innovative solutions, which they then\nneed to research and sell to a panel\nof 12 BP judges. Every year, the competition revolves around a new topic.\nhis year, the challenge was to come\nup with a single technical innovation\nthat could reduce the cost of PKT\n(Passenger Kilometer Travelled) in\nthe UK by 2030. In other words, reduce the cost of public transporta-tion. An interview of the three teammates has yielded valuable insight\ninto just what it takes to wow the\njudges of the BP competition.\nhe \ufb01rst stage involved an online questionnaire where questions\nwere speci\ufb01cally designed not to\nhave simple solutions available on-line. From then on, each step of the\ncompetition required more research\nand problem-solving to get the candidates into the mindset of what\nbeing an engineer actually entails.\nAfter successfully passing the \ufb01rst\nround, the team went on to produce a\npowerpoint presentation, and then a\nprofessional technical poster outlining their idea. heir main technical\ninnovation is Regenerative Breaking\nwith Onboard Storage. his technology would allow train operators to\nsave money by harnessing the energy\nthat is lost through braking when the\ntrains stops. hat energy would be\nstored onboard while the train is sta-tionary, and then fed it back into the\nmotors when the train leaves, which\nwould allow for faster acceleration.\nhe team has calculated that this\ntechnology could save train operators\n105 million pounds a year. his would\nbe achieved by installing lithium-ion\ncapacitors on existing trains, which\nwould store the energy.\nHowever having a good idea isn\u2019t\nthe whole story. he team had to be\nable to convince the judges of just\nhow e\ufb00ective their technological innovation was. he structure of the\ncompetition intends to allow them\nto work on their presentation skills\nand their ability to perform under\npressure, but what really separated\nthem from the herd was the sheer\namount of background research they\nproduced. his allowed them to shine\nwhen it came to Q&A after last Tuesday\u2019s Semi-Final 10 minute presenta-tion; and could well be the main reason they are the only team that went\nthrough from Imperial this year.\nAll three members agree that this\njourney has showed them the importance of teamwork and perseverance.\nIf you had asked them back in October, none of them would have imagined getting so far in the competition.\nAll three describe the experience as\n\u201cchallenging but rewarding\u201d. hey all\nrecommend the competition to Imperial students. Despite the amount\nof work that is necessary, the journey\nis enriching, and you get to visit BP\u2019s\nLondon o\ufb03ces.\nEmma Judge, Head of Graduate\nResourcing at BP, said: \u201cSubmissions for this year\u2019s UFT have been\nbetter than ever and it\u2019s great to see\nImperial College London making it\nthough to the Grand Final. We wish\nEdward Courtnell, Stephen Rose\nand Dominik Sznajder the very best\nof luck and we\u2019re looking forward to\nseeing them again on the 8th March\nin London. It\u2019s going to be a great\nnight, and they have the extra bonus\nthis year of meeting the science man\nof the moment, Dara O Briain!\u201d.\nhe next step is to produce and edit\na video and a pitch, which they will\npresent to BP o\ufb03cials, judges and a\npress-corps on March 8th, 2013. hey\nwill be working with a professional\nediting company and BP experts to\nmake sure everything is ready for\nthe Final, which will take place in the\nRoyal Institute of Great Britain.\nPhilippe Rival Reporter\nIpsos MORI\nstress security\nof NSS\nwhere they are sitting in an exam.\nWith this information, the only other\npiece to the puzzle that is needed is\nthe day and month of birth; once this\ninformation is obtained, the NSS can\nbe \ufb01lled out. his can, of course, be\nfound using some choice Facebook\nsearching.\nAll of this leads to the possibility\nof fraud, as well as someone being\nable to build a programme that \ufb01lls\nout the survey on behalf of many stu-dents.\nFelix contacted Ipsos MORI, who\nconducts the survey. Sami Benyahai, Director of Higher Education\nResearch, responded that they have\nmultiple safe guards in place. Benyahai said: \u201cSurveys submitted are\nonce again checked electronically\nand where needed manually. Where\nthere is doubt about the identify of a\nrespondent the interview is rejected.\nWe send email con\ufb01rmations to respondents to their university emails.\nWe collect IP addresses, monitor response rates and response patterns.\nWe work closely with institutions\nand students\u2019 union[s].\u201d\nTo complete the NSS, a student\nmust put in their CID, the \ufb01rst letter of their \ufb01rst name, the \ufb01rst four\nletters of their last name, and the day\nand month of their birth.\nResearch councils dictate that the\nCollege must take part in the NSS,\nand a failure to get a certain number\nof replies leads to the result being\nvoid. his a\ufb00ects the standing of Imperial College London in the league\ntables. he NSS is still going on, and\nstudents who have not \ufb01lled it out\nyet will start receiving calls.\nFelix also contacted the Business\nSchool, but is yet to hear back, as the\nstory only came in very late.\nThe three finalists from Imperial\nBP\n\n"

As horror anthology goes, this is the Concorde moment, 26 short \ufb01lms from\nsome of the most twisted horror\nminds, it\u2019s a brave bold stab at something that may never be repeated.\nhankfully there is no hackneyed\nattempt to link them with an over-arching story, each \ufb01lm just starts\nand ends with a red screen and a title\ncard. he directors vary in national-ity, style and insanity. As with any\nanthology \ufb01lm, there will always be\nhigh and low points. Some were just\ntoo weird for my liking (and I have a\npretty high tolerance for weird), they\nare all pretty di\ufb00erent and the fact\nthat the ones I didn\u2019t like seemed to\nme to have similar themes might just\nre\ufb02ect my tastes.\nIt\u2019s always refreshing to see how\neach director tackles the brief. Some\npresent just a climactic scene from\nwhat you imagine as a longer \ufb01lm,\nsome present whole stories in twisted worlds (think he Twilight Zone),\nothers feel almost like bizarre advert\nskits but without any product, and a\ncouple attempt to make meta-horror.\nMany have a low budget, Troma-like\nfeel to them (think he Toxic Avenger), there are plenty of nods to classic\n\ufb01lms and directors, and it\u2019s a truly\ninternational undertaking (I don\u2019t\nthink there is a word of English spoken for the \ufb01rst 30 minutes). Clocking in at over two hours it is long, but\nI found that when it lagged the slack\nwas quickly picked up by another\nshort.\nhere are plenty of jaw-droppers.\nhe unparalleled Ben Wheatley (Kill\nList, Sightseers) shows the closing\nscene of a monster \ufb01lm, from the\nview of the monster. Jake West gives\na great chase scene, and I now forgive him for the terrible Danny Dyer\nvehicle Doghouse. Chilean director\nErnesto D\u00edaz Espinoza (almost unknown in the UK) gives a nice, tight\nlittle time travel \ufb01lm, similar in style\nto Nacho Vigalondo\u2019s Timecrimes\n(who directs the \ufb01rst of the anthol-ogy). Less well known Timo Tjahjanto, gives one of the weirdest and\nmost vile premises, but actually ends\nup making one of the most intriguing (it de\ufb01nitely stayed with me the\nlongest).\nhe best in my opinion comes\nfrom Marcel Sarmiento (the mind\nbehind the crowd dividing Deadgirl). he cinematography, pacing\nand suspense he manages in 5 minutes is better than most full lengths.\nOther treats (if you can call them\nthat) include French Xavier Gens\u2019\n(frontier(s)) gorefest on body image,\nand the stop-motion fun of Lee Hardcastle (the winner of a competition to\nsend in home-made \ufb01lms).\nhere are also a few duds. he usually great Ti West (of the spectacularly retro he House of he Devil)\ngives the laziest and most pathetic\nentry. Noboru Iguchi gives one entitled Fart, which I de\ufb01nitely could\nhave done without. However he did\ndirect RoboGeisha and Machine Girl,\nso it\u2019s to be expected. Infamous director Srdjan Spasojevic\u2019s piece (of\nthe un-watchable A Serbian Film)\npretty much passed me by. Weird?\nYes, violent? Yes. But it just felt like it\nthought it was being cleverer than it\nwas (much like the detestable A Serbian Film).\nAs the \ufb01lm nears its end, the most\nextreme parts appear. W (aptly entitled WTF) is the most acid-trip like,\nand then Y and Z hit real depravity\nwhich for me was too far. Z, from\nYoshihiro Nishimura (of Tokyo Gore\nPolice fame, so it\u2019s to be expected)\ncould easily cause o\ufb00ence, although\nthe more easily o\ufb00ended won\u2019t get\nthis far.\nI\u2019ve seen mixed reviews for this, and\nto be honest, it\u2019s the kind of \ufb01lm that\nis almost pointless to review. If you\n\ufb01nd it over the top and in poor taste,\nthen what did you really expect? If it\u2019s\ntoo scatterbrained and plot-less, then\ndon\u2019t watch a 26 part anthology!

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\n8\nNewitt would be interesting\nCaroline Wood finally enjoys a lecture at Imperial\nhe annual Newitt Lecture,\nhosted by the Chemical\nEngineering department,\nwas given by Edward\nDavey MP, Secretary of\nState for Energy and Climate Change\non Wednesday evening. his was the\n\ufb01rst time that the lecture has been\ngiven by a politician \u2013 rather than a\nchemical engineer \u2013 a clear signal that\nthe worlds of politics, science and engineering are becoming ever more en-twined.\nhe title of the 2013 lecture was \u201che\nEnergy Challenge; Technology and Solutions\u201d. Mr Davey\u2019s speech addressed\nkey areas where engineering innovations could help support economic\npolicies and lead to a greener economy.\nConfessing that his Chemistry education ended at O-level, albeit with\nan A, Davey made no apologies about\ndelivering a hearty political speech to\nan audience of engineers. Boldly, he set\nout what he believes to be the greatest\nchallenge of our time: to power our\ncountry and protect the planet.\nIn times of political volatility, where\nworld power centres are shifting (by\n2035 China and India together will be\nconsuming 30% of the world\u2019s energy)\nhe noted two key realities. he \ufb01rst,\nthat global energy demand will continue to be met by fossil fuels well beyond 2035 \u2013 despite only meeting 1/3\nof global energy demand overall. And\nthe second, that given this unpalatable\npracticality, the use of unabated CO2\ncannot continue.\nhe levels of CO2\nin the atmosphere\nare higher than at any point on the last\n800,000 years, at least. With older records indicating that historic rises in\nCO2\ncaused by volcanic eruptions led\nto acidi\ufb01cation of oceans and extinction of marine wildlife the cost of not\nacting to mitigate and control climate\nchange is too high. As Stern famously\nargues, the cost now is signi\ufb01cant, but\nis far outweighed by the long terms\ncosts of inaction.\nDavey illustrated the complexities of\nforming international climate agree-ments, and urged the students and\nprofessors in the audience to \u201cnot leave\nit to politicians\u201d. Davey was insistent\nthat the solutions to the impending\nclimate challenges need to be met by\na collaborative e\ufb00ort by society, with\ninnovation, invention and engineering\nall playing a critical role.\nA pragmatic 3-pronged approach\nsuggested included saving energy\nthrough improving energy e\ufb03ciency,\nlowering the cost of low carbon tech-nologies, and investing broadly in research and development. All will no\ndoubt be essential parts of the solution.\nHowever, Davey more ambitiously\nchallenged the audience to focus their\nresearch e\ufb00orts on 3 key emerging\n\ufb01elds: Carbon Capture and Sequestration, Energy Storage and Hydrogen.\nGiven the continued use of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future is highly\nprobable, improving Carbon Capture\nand Sequestration techniques will be\ncrucial in ensuring global CO2\nlevels\ndon\u2019t rise uncontrollably. Improved\nmethods of energy storage could also\nbe a game changer, with \ufb02y-wheels,\nbatteries and electrolysis all noted as\nareas with potential for signi\ufb01cant in-novation. Hydrogen was the \ufb01nal area\nof research that Davey urged more\nengineers to consider. If it can be commercialised then hydrogen could be a\nviable component of our future energy\nmix.\nEither way, the premise is the same.\nCarbon needs to be designed out of the\npower train. And there is still a huge\ngap between where we are and where\nwe need to get to.\nDavey\u2019s \ufb01nal remarks were about\nhow his experiences as a student led\nto his interest in climate change and\nthe environment. He told the audience\nhow he extensively read books on the\nsubject, such as Jonathon Porritt\u2019s Seeing Green, and was also part of student\necology group at Oxford university before helping transform it into to more\nresolute \u2018Green Action\u2019 group.\nhe resounding message from this\nspeech was that passion and politics\nalone will not be enough to address the\nclimate problems we are facing. here\nneeds to an unprecedented e\ufb00ort from\ngovernments, engineers, scientists and\nthe rest of society if we are to truly surmount \u201cthe greatest challenge of our\ntime\u201d.\nMany thanks to William Brown and\nheodor Bergstrom for organising the\nevent.\nT\nA lecture? Yay! We don\u2019t get enough of those around here...\nEdward Davey MP,\nSecretary of State\nfor Energy and\nClimate Change\nThe Newitt Lecture is an annual\nevent given in the name of Dudley\nNewitt. Newitt was a keen Chemist from a young age and although\nhis career was interrupted for a\nnumber of years due to the First\nWorld War, he later gained a Bachelors degree in chemistry from the\nRoyal College of Science \u2013 now\npart of Imperial. He then went\non to do a PhD and DSc before\nbecoming a member of founding\ncommittee of the British Institution for Chemical Engineers and\nlater being elected as president.\nNewitt\u2019s academic achievements continued, as he became a\nprofessor of chemical engineering\nand then the Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering.\nHe was largely responsible for the\nexpansion and improvement of\nthe department, and also helped\nto restructure the students\u2019 union\nto better facilitate overseas stu-dents. As a result of this, he was\nelected as Pro-Rector of the College, a post he held until he retired\nin 1961.\nNewitt was an extraordinary\nindividual, advocating the use of\ndiversity to solve problems. With\nthis in mind, the topic of climate\nchange seemed fitting for the 2013\nlecture \u2013 a challenge that needs to\nbe confronted not only by engineers and scientists, but society\nas a whole.\nNewitt Lecture\n\u201c\nby 2035 China and India together will be consuming 30%\nof the world\u2019s energy\nSupport act couldn\u2019t keep their attention\n\n"

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY\n26\nhave recently discovered the\nreal reason the Pope is giving\nup on wearing his natty white\ngown and driving about in his\nsuped-up Pope-mobile to devote more of his time to chillaxing. He\nmust have been present at St Leonard\u2019s\nChurch last Friday where Veronica\nFalls blew away the congregation with\nan outstanding set. Evidently it became\nclear to him that the best way to get\nbums on pews and religion back into\nthe hearts and tweets of the young is\nto be in a swoonsome twee indie band\nwhich specialise in jangly guitar pop.\nIt is not surprising that this idea must\nhave dispirited Herr Ratzinger (as he\nis more of a dubstep or electo-crunk\nkind of guy) to such an extent that he\nhad no choice but to step down.\nNow I have got the frolicking introduction out of the way I must get to\nthe important part of describing the\nactual gig. It goes without saying that\nVeronica Falls are more C86 then it is\nAMS album of the week\nWhenever I have an article to write I find the\nfirst sentences and phrases always come to\nme when I\u2019m walking on my own. My rough\ndraft for this review emerged the same way; I\nwas ready to talk less about the album, which\nwas okay, and more about the promise of My\nBloody Valentine recording once more. But\nthen I listened to it again.\nFor me and, anecdotally, for many fans of\nthe band, m b v is a definite grower, and that\u2019s\nprobably as much the fault of \u2018weight of expectation\u2019 as anything. Unfortunately, being their first new material in 12 years,\nit\u2019s consigned to exist in the shadow of Loveless, the album that almost bankrupt\ntheir record label with it\u2019s technical demands, and defined shoegaze as a genre.\nBut, My Bloody Valentine\u2019s albums have always been the kind of records that\nreward repeat listens, the kind of records that don\u2019t necessarily \u2018click\u2019 the first\ntime you hear them. What makes their albums so evocative is not just the music\nitself, but the way it blends with your mental state; being able to lose yourself in\nits tidal waves of sound, hearing Kevin Shield\u2019s and Bilinda Butcher\u2019s vocals float\naround you.\nI once saw Loveless described as sounding like \u201cdruggy sex or sexy drugs\u201d. If\nthat\u2019s the case, then m b v is the morning after that hazy fugue. Album opener,\n\u2018SheFoundNow\u2019sgentlyflowingriverofnoisepullsyouintothatlimbolikestate\nof a rainy sunday afternoon. From there, the album only opens up, beginning\nwith elements that would\u2019ve sounded at home on Loveless before branching off\ninto new territory, that sees the album close with a track that somehow blends\nShield\u2019s trademark \u2018Glide Guitar\u2019 with a punchy drum and bass beat.\nIt says something about the impact that album had that Loveless has been\nmentioned in this review almost as much as m b v. But, this is a great record that\ndeserves to stand up on it\u2019s own. It\u2019s both familiar, but strikes a clear course out\nof the shadow of that 1991 epic. Kevin Shield\u2019s said as much himself, explaining\nthat m b v \u201creally frees us up, and in the bigger picture it\u2019s 100 percent necessary.\u201d\nCritical acclaim can crush a group, but My Bloody Valentine have ridden out the\nstorm; here\u2019s to hoping they keep recording albums like this.\nVeronicaFallsatStLeonard\u2019s\nMark EnglandgoestochurchonaFridaynight,andenjoysit...\npossible to be but what sometimes can\nseen somewhat one dimensional on\nrecord has a much fuller sound when\nyou hear it live. St Leonard\u2019s suits the\nband down to the ground with songs\nlike \u2018Found Love in a Graveyard\u2019,\n\u2018Stephen\u2019 and \u2018Wedding Day\u2019 echoing hauntingly around the cavernous\nvenue.\nhe purpose of tonight\u2019s show, how-ever, is to give the ears of Shoreditch\na preview of material of the new album Waiting for Something to Happen. I found the title track one of the\nmore grating but there were some real\ngems in \u2018Teenage\u2019 and \u2018Tell Me\u2019. he\nnoise pop that Veronica Falls hustle\nhas evolved to become more muscular\nbut still keeps its timid, eyes across the\nindie-disco dance\ufb02oor, quality.\nhe sold out show was crammed full\nand you couldn\u2019t even \ufb01t another Japanese hipster girl in if you tried. here\nwas a sense that the band were preaching to the converted but this should\nnot detract from how accomplished\nthe band were as a live prospect. he\nlo-\ufb01 fuzz of the records is lost and is\nreplaced by a more elegant sheen. he\nlast time I saw Veronca Falls, admittedly a few years ago now, was in the\nbasement of a dingy record shop in\nCamden and they were bloody terri-ble. hey had minimal presence and\ntheir lyrics were lost beneath a sea of\nAlbum review: Maranata - Royal Hex\nFree-noise duo Maranata have collaborated with some big \ufb01gures in the\nexperimental scene including Maja\nS.K Ratkje and C.Spencer Yeh. On\nthis e\ufb00ort, released on a 175 cassette\nrun (remember that, it\u2019s important),\nthey collaborate with Sayaka Himeno,\nSakaya Himeno of Japanese all girl trio\nNisennenmondai. his is probably the\nmain thing that piqued my interest, as\nshe is a drummer of the highest order\nand she shows it with aerobic but tightly controlled drumming which takes\nas much from free jazz as it does from\nLightning Bolt.\nMy \ufb01rst impression of this album was\nthatithadaverylo-\ufb01aesthetic,asmight\nbe expect. You may recall, however, that\nthis was a cassette, and after rigorous\ncleaning of the heads I discovered that\nthis wasn\u2019t the case at all, or certainly\nmuch less than I expected. he perils of\nusing a non-digital format\u2026\nIf I haven\u2019t exactly been forthcoming in describing most of the album, it\u2019s\nbecause I was a little \ufb02abbergasted. It\u2019s\nan assault on the ears, \ufb01ring through\na selection of genres, and while it may\nonly have appeal to noiseheads, it is\nworth noting that it is very diverse and\nsubtly unlike any other album I\u2019ve heard\nto date.\nJon Wesseltoft\u2019s guitar is almost ever\npresent, bringing in at time punky\nand doomy motifs and at times simply\nnoisy. Dag Stiberg performs saxophone\nduties. As well as its contribution to\njazz, people like Mats Gustafsson have\nused the saxophone to add noise, and\nthis is certainly the role here. he saxophone is just as ever present as the\nguitar but lower in the mix, sounding a\nlittle like a screamed vocal at low vol-ume. It does, however, rear its head at\nappropriate moments, giving it almost\na tidal feel and any moment where it\nprevails seems to have a rather climactic air to it.\nIt does have some less dense mo-ments, the start of the second side \u2013\n\u2018Royal Hex\u2019 (each track is a side long)\nis a good example, where the sound is\nmore groove oriented, as the drums\nslowly speed up bringing the music\nback into the noisier territories where\nit belongs.\nAquarius Records compared the album to Borbetomagus jamming with\nLightning Bolt and, to be honest, I\u2019m\nnot sure I can top that.\nRiaz Agahi Writer\nMy Bloody Valentine: mbv\nI\nPadraic Calpin\nfeedback. I was startled by their transformation into indie heavyweights and\nI am sure that their latest release will\nbe as good as their one time Rough\nTrade record of the month self-titled\ndebut. I have never had so much fun\nin a church before (although I am not\nsure if this is a large accolade) and I\nde\ufb01nitely have Veronica Falls to thank\nfor that.\n\n"

More complicated emergen-cies, including blue light emergencies\nwill be directed to specialist centres.\nhe \ufb01nal decision will be made by\nNHS North West London (NHS NWL)\non February 19 but it is con\ufb01rmed that\nthe A&E unit will remain open. here\nwill also be a \u00a390 million cash injection\nto the hospital to help rebuild the site\nand will secure the future of the hos-pital.\nEaling, Hammersmith and Central\nMiddlesex Hospital are expected to\nlose their A&E\u2019s as a part of the Shaping a Healthier Future programme that\nneeds to save around \u00a31 billion over\nthe next three years as well as apparently aiming to improve standards.\nAemun Reza News Editor However, the informal announcement by the Hammersmith & Fulham\ncouncil was not seen as a major victory\nto the campaign groups. Campaign\ngroups have said that this result is a\n\u2018second-best deal\u2019 and has fallen far\nshort of their expectations.\nhey compare the deal to the one\nthat Lewisham Hospital was given last\nweek where its A&E was downgraded\nfrom category one to a category three\nunit.\nChair of the protest group, Carlo\nNero, said: \u201cIf we\u2019re e\ufb00ectively being\ngiven the deal Lewisham was o\ufb00ered\nwhy should our local doctors be any-less unhappy, and in some cases even\noutraged, than theirs?\n\u201cIt seems clear to me, having chaired\nthis campaign since last June, that this\nis absolutely not the result that Save\nour Hospitals was set up to achieve,\nand that we should continue to cam-paign.\nhey believe that the 500 in-patient\nbed and\u2018blue-light\u2019 A&E will become\nsomewhat of a cottage hospital with\nonly 60 beds. he A&E usually treats\n100,000 patients a year and has separate funding for cancer, teaching and\nmental health specialist departments\nand a new community service role.\nA spokesman for Save Hammersmith & Fulham hospitals said: \u201cWe\nwelcome the news that NHS North\nWest London seems to be prepared\nto listen at last to residents\u2019 concerns\nabout its ill-thought out consultation\nplans to close four of the nine A&Es\ncurrently serving the area.\n\u201cHowever, until we see their actual\nproposal and read the small print we\nwill continue to campaign for the preservation of full A&E services at both\nCharing Cross and Hammersmith\nhospitals.\u201d\nGreg Hands, the Tory MP for Chelsea and Fulham said that \u201chis is\nde\ufb01nitely a step in the right direction\ncompared with what was originally\nproposed, which was to reduce Charing Cross to something like a tenth of\nits current size.\n\u201cBut we need to see more details and\ncompare this new plan not just with\nthe worst case scenario but also with\nthe status quo.\u201d\nHammersmith and Fulham councillor Marcus Ginn said:\u201che massive\nopposition from local people to the\noriginal proposals has forced NHS\nmanagers to rethink their plans.\n\u201che \u00a390m cash injection now proposed by the NHS would secure the\nhospital\u2019s future for generations to\ncome and the top priority was always\nto save Charing Cross and the services\nso many of our residents rely on.\n\u201cIn return, we have agreed to halt\nour legal challenge to the NHS proposals as all but the most complex emergencies will continue to be treated at\nCharing Cross. We believe that we\nhave secured the best possible deal for\nour residents.\u201d\nImperial College London were contacted for comment, however they had\nnone until after the public meeting on\nthe 19th February where all the details\nwill be announced.\nA&E Department to remain open after a U-Turn\nhere has been a fantastic\nresponse to the student\nlead initiative, Action\nSyria, raising awareness\nabout the situation in Syria at Imperial College. he turmoil in\nSyria has become dramatically worse\nover the last two years. he situation\nin Syria is typically reported as political issue in the headlines; however, the\nfocus of Action Syria has been solely\non the humanitarian side.\nhe President of the Islamic Society\nat Imperial, Usman Siddiqui said \u201che\ninterest and concern shown by many\nstudents for those su\ufb00ering thousands\nof miles away has been really uplift-ing, as living in Central London many\nneighbours do not even look out for\neach other.\u201d\nLast Tuesday, the Keynote lecture\non Syria was held at Imperial. he\nspeakers included Iman Murphy, a\nbusiness woman, mother and an aid\nworker for the charity \u201cHand in Hand\nSyria\u201d; Dr. Mahmoud Akraa, a medical\ndoctor who has treated injured people\nin Syria; and Sha\ufb01ul Amin the founder\nfor Students4Syria. hey all delivered\nemotional speeches, speaking about\ntheir experience in Syria as well as\nmotivating\nthe attendees\nto participate\nand make\na di\ufb00erence.\nI m a n\nM u r p h y\nk i n d l y\ngave Felix a quote\nas to why\ns t u d e n t s\nshould donate \u201cwe\nshare the\nsame sky,\nlive in the\nsame world;\nr e g a r d l e s s\nof age, creed\nand gender\nwe have a\nresponsibil-ity.
