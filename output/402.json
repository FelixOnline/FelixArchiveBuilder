Protection under the rent acts\nDave Rawnsley - Student Residence Officer\nHere is a little advice on harassment and unlawful eviction, security of tenure and rents. Further details may be obtained\nfrom the Rent Officer, 90 Cromwell Road( on the corner of Gloucester Road), your local town hall or from me in the Union\nOffice.\n1. Protection against eviction and harassment.\nIt is a criminal offence for\nanyone to turn you out of\nyour home without a court\norder or to try to drive you\nout using threats, violence\nbullying, or any other type\nof interference.\nIf you are lawfully occupying a house, flat or rooms\nas your home and anyone\ntries to treat you in- this\nway, you should inform your\nlocal council. They have\npower to prosecute and\nthere are heavy penalties\non conviction. This basic\nprojection applies to everyone.\nTenants of private landlords\nhave the additional rights\ndescribed here under \"security\nof tenure\" and \"Rents\".\n2. Security of tenure\na) Protected tenancies.\nTenants of furnished and\nunfurnished houses and\nflats or rooms which are not\npart of their landlord's home\nwith a rate able value not\nexceeding \u00a31500 in London\nare protected by Rent Act security. Only the court\ncan order such tenants to\nleave even if a notice to\nquit has expired or a fixed\nterm tenancy has ended. The The court cannot make such\nan order except on grounds\nlaid down in the 1968 Rent\nAct, as amended by the\n1974 Rent Act \u2014 for example,\nthat the tenant is not paying\nthe rent, or is causing annoyance to the neighbours, or is\ndamaging the landlord's furniture.\nb) Letting s which are part\nof the house in which the\nlandlord lives. Except for those tenants\nof unfurnished accommodation\nwho lived in the same house\nas their landlords before\n14 August 1974, those in\naccommodation which is part\nof thier landlord's own home,\nand where the rate able value\nof the part they occupy does\nnot exceed \u00a31500 in London,\ncan apply to the Rent\nTribunal if they receive\nnotice to quit, to have the\neffect of the notice postponed.\nThe address for Kensington\nand Chelsea is Newlands\nHouse, 37/40 Berners Street\nLondon W1P 4 BP( Tel:5802000). They are open\nfrom 9.30am till 4.30pm Monday\nto Friday. You must apply-before the notice expires. (At\nleast four weeks' warning in\nwriting must be given for the\nnotice to be valid). Rent\nTribunals can give tenants\nup to six months' security at\na time. If you live outside\nKensington and Chelsea the\naddress of your rent tribunal\nmay be obtained from your\nlocal council offices or\nCitizens Advice Bureau \u2014\n140 Ladbroke Grove W1D 5 ND( Tel 960 3322 or 969 2433\nor 250 King's Road SW3 ( Tel3528101)3. Rents\na) Protected tenancies\n1. Regulated tenancies\nA tenancy of a dwelling\nwhich is protected by Rent\nAct security, but is not\ncontrolled (see below) is called a regulated tenancy.\nThe Rent Officer will determine a fair rent for are guIa ted tenancy on app Ii cat i or\nby the tenant or by the\nlandlord or by both of them\ntogether. If either landlord\nor tenant objects to the Rent\nOfficers determination he will pass the matter to a Rent\nAssessment Committee who\nwill settle it after hearing\nboth sides. When a rent has\nbeen registered you cannot\nlawfully be required to pay\nmore unless the increase is\ni) to take account of any\nincrease in rates ii) to take\naccount of the cost of\nimprovements iii) to take\naccount of an increase in the\nfuel, whenever the rent\nincludes an element for fuel\nusing services or iv) where\nthe tenant is a student and\nthe landlord is an educational\ninstitution. For further details\nsee the booklet 'Your Rents,\nRights and Responsibilities' obtainable free from Rent\nofficers.\n2. Rent agreements\nUnder the Housing Finance Act1972, Landlords and\ntenants may agree rent\nincreases between themselves'.\nAgreements must be in\nwriting. This will not\ninter fer with your right to\napply for registration of a rent at any time.\n3. Controlled tenancies\nThese are tenancies which\ndate from before 1957 and\nremained controlled after\nthe 1957 Rent Act. If a dwelling let on a controlled\ntenancy is certified by the\nlocal authority as being in\na good state of repair, the\ntenancy comes out of control\nand becomes regulated (see\nabove). Rents for controlled\ntenancies were fixed by the\nRent Act of 1957. They can be increased only if the\nlandlord pays the rates and\nthese go up or if the landlord\nimproves or repairs the\ndwelling and then only by\nContinued on page 4.\n\n"

The first team,\nfortified by the inclusion of sprinter Dave West and by\nthe return of something rapidly\napproaching fitness of Steve\nWebb, event aul ly finished 6th out of about 30 teams; their\nbest performance in this\nevent for some years.\nUnfortunately it was not\nraining so Borough Road\nwere there \u2014 otherwise we\nwould have done even better.\nRob All in son on the first\nleg, came home fourth\nwith our fastest time, 8m13s, following which- Dave\nRosen, Steve, Dave W and Paul Clarke were\nbattling against stronger\nopposition (but hanging on\nwell) until finally Ian Ellis completed the team's performance with a time of 8m41s: this followed an earlier\nrun by Ian on the second\nlap for the C team, well It was decided after much\nheated discussion that an\nunbiased match report should\nbe written, thus I( the goalie)\nwas chosen.\nThe team playing members\nof the team seemed to think\nthat they had the match\nsewn up with four goals in\ntwenty minutes, when\nsuddenly ... nothing happened,\nfor the rest of the first half\nand fifteen minutes into the\nnext ... nothing further\nhappened. Then a shout from\nthe rear - \"Spread it wide\"\ntimed in 10m54s, during\nwhich his much publicised attributes were kept strictly\nunder control.\nOn the second lap for\nthe B team, Alf Garnett\nshowed a well turned-ankle\nwith an unexpectedly fast\ntime of 8m37s. The other\nmore sedan try runners in\nthis team were Dave Jones, Alan Leakey, Colin Dale,\nPete Johnson and a new\nstar Mike Daley. The third\nteam, which was at one\ntime last, eventually managed\nto beat some of the school\nteams: the team featured\nMike Welford, not only running\ntwice (!) but also beating\nrival Andy Davey, and\nDave J and Rob both completing a second lap. The journey\nhome featured a round of\na'pplause when the clutch on the van decided to work\nin one of its less stubborn\n(the hockey ball!) worked\nmiracles. A frozen J. L. received two balls in less\nthan a minute. This shocked\nhim into life and his return\npass i ed to the first of four\nmore goals. IC once more\neased off and the fullbacks\nnearly made a disastrous\nmoments: for related remarks\nsee FELIX No. 351.\nOn Saturday the usual IC\nhordes were reduced to\nthree in number for the UL match against Oxford and\nBirmingham Universities at\nOxford. The coach at Ma let\nStreet sup rise d everyone\nby being fifteen minutes\nearly: unfortunately it had\nalready sprung a leak so it\nleft a more traditional half\nhour late. Having circled Oxford's Ring Road and\nstopped three cars on a roundabout for directions,\nthe famous Iffley Road track\nwas found overgrown with\ngreen stuff (precise botanical\nspecification unavailable) and-reduced to four lanes.\nHowever, two coaches\ncontaining 18 enthusiastic\nand fit UL runners and various\nodds and sods from the\nother Universities set off\nmistake! I actually had to\nmove! Dropping my fag, I ran out from the goal and\nkicked the ball clear. From\nthe look of surprise on our\nCaptain's face at that\nmoment, I can conclude\nnothing. After this, the\nonly notable event of the\nfrom here looking for the\ncourse: this was discovered\nhidden in a bank of fog and\na heavy shower of rain at\nthe top of some hill. This hill was very high as we\nfound later on having to run\nup and down it and round\nsomething of a switchback\ncourse three times. This6 and a bit miles completed,\nthe results were computed,\nand thus approximately\nwe had Birmingham University\nplaces 1 to 15, Oxford\nUniversity 16 to 33, UL34 to 52. There were some\nexceptions - notably third\nhome for UL at 22nd Dave\nRosen, formerly of Oxford\nbut now of IC, one bound to\ngo far (at least 50 miles a week.) Further down the\nfield, in the main UL pack\nwas Dave Jones at 39th; John Shearer, the third IC\nrepresentative, found four\nmiles on this, very murky\nday more than enough and\njoined the D NF's. match, the ball went into\nour opponents net three\nmore times before the\nfinal whistle was blown\nby our Chairman; Many\nthanks!

We were only eight\nstrong as D Balderstone,\nthe captain of the 2nd XI, had\ncommander ed two players\nfor his use. We also had to\nresort to a kicking-back as\nall our goal keeping gear had\nbeen requisitioned by the\n1st XI (owing to the efficiency\nof J Martial-arts).\nOn being informed of our\nplight, the Hayes captain\nlent us one of his players.\nThus, outnumbered ten to\nFive members travelled to\nWoods in Suffolk, last Sunday\nto compete in the Icenian\nTrophy Event. The terrain\nwas very flat and fast, and\nthe controls were generally\neasy to find, giving the fast\nrunners an advantage.\nHowever, there was a high\ndensity of control points in\nthe forest, and several people\nnine we started the game..\nAlmost from the bully-off,\nIC's superiority was\nevident. The forwards\nattacked confidently and the\nwings were used extensively.\nThe defence had enough of\na game to prevent them getting\nbored.\nDavid Carl lie, our ever-grinning right winger, scored\nthe first goal. Hayes then\nmanaged to draw even.\nDavid Carlile retaliated\nwith our second goal.

The\nfirst of these was by Edmund\nReed, our left winger. The\nnext one came from (yes,\nguessed it) David Carlile, who thus qualified himself\nto buy us a' Jug'( which\nwe're still waiting for).\nChristopher Parker netted\nthe fifth goal: this was a rising shot from the edge of\nthe ' D' and which went in\njust under the crossbar.\nThe Hayes man lent to us\n6th Tony Warwick 93mins15 s ecH' coarse 3.0Km5 th Martin Kessler 41mins15 sec\nThe club will be going to\nBagley Wood near Oxford for\na small event next Sunday\n(November 23rd). However,\nscored the sixth goal and\nDavid Carlile slotted in the\nseventh.\nThe rain made things\nawkward, especially in the\nsecond half when it came\ndown in sheets, virtually\nblinding the bespectacled\nplayers. Nevertheless, it\nwas a most enjoyable game\nand we look forward to\nplaying them again next\nseason.\nTeam:- M Bachrynowski, PC\nNair, K Shine, T Sethi, C Parker (capt,), D Carlile,\nJ Brownridge, E Reed, plus\na Hayes man.\ncloser to home on Wednesday\nNovember 26th, the club is\norganising an introductory\nevent on Hampstead Heath.

Several hundred people packed the Union\nconcert hall to view the annual Sex, Filth & Depravity\nshow.'\nChalky White opened the\nproceedings by introducing\nChem I and their Teddy\nBears' orgy. In this, several\nmembers of the department\nmuddled their way through a sketch singing Python-like\nsongs and occasionally rolling on the floor stroking\neach other.\nAfter suffering Chalky\nWhite's jokes for a couple of\nminutes, we were introduced\nto RCS executive and their\nBig Bang Theory. Nic Roe,\na professor involved in the\nstudy of sex, explained in\nhis broken German the\nresearch being carried out\non this subject. In an\nexplicit dialogue, illustrated\nwith equations and utilising dimensional analysis, he\nproved that sex leads to\nbabies. Quite a revelation!\nOther members of RCS executive then went on to\ndescribe their involvement\nwith sex. The sketch went\ndown well, even with the\nGuildsmen, who proved that\ntheir paper darts could be\naimed very accurately, much\nto the em barras ment of Miss HitchCock. Physics I performed next.\nTwo little schoolboys\ninnocently playing marbles\nwere confronted by a mysterious\nfigure who unashamedly\nunfastened his coat, sending\nthem away terrified. Then\na young tart parading around\nthe stage was also confronted\nby this mystery man. After\nexposing himself once\nagain, the girl ran away\nscreaming. What could\npossibly be so horrible? ...\nThe mummified Simon Chase\nand his big * * * * * .\nRecovering from Simon\nChase's masterpiece, we\nwere confronted by Maths I. In an amalgam of old Monty\nPython material they tried\nto disgust the audience,\ndrinking piss and phlegm\nout of buckets. Later we\nwere introduced to a dog\nwhich bore a strange resemblance to a bog brush and\nhad a liking for bar-maids.\nAfter refusing to 'mount'\non two occasions his owner\nwas forced to demonstrate,\namid much noisy encouragement\nfrom the audience. But as\nlive sex is not allowed\nat RCS Smoking Concerts,\nthe curtain came down.\nThe drag artists,\" Play girls\", were next on\nthe bill. They pranced around\nthe stage miming to various\nfemale recordings (Boring).\nThis went on for much too\nlong and eventually they\nresorted to em barra sing those members of the audience\nsitting close to the stage.\nThey finished off their act\nin a much better fashion,\nproving they were quite hot\nstuff.\nAfter a break for liquid\nrefreshment, Kang alas, Boomalakas and various\nother tribal songs 2001: A Space Obscenity. This was\nan incredibly long rendition\nby Chemistry 7(?), but they\nmanaged to keep the audience\namused for most of the time\nalthough the puns became\nrather painful at times. The\nact provoked much audience\nparticipation. At one stage\nBUM( their British made\ncomputer) gave the results\nof the 3rd test as \" England won by an innings and 168\nruns. \"Highly improbable','\nreplied Mr Pocks. \"Bloody\ninconceivable\" someone\nshouted. And so it went-on\nand on and on and on ....\nAfter more Kangalas etc.\nit was the turn of the ICU executive to show us how\nto be very silly. John Downs\narrived complete with baby\nin pram. \"When's the next\ntrain North?\", he asked. The question passed slowly\ndown the executive line\nfrom Keith( beautiful legs)\nAhlers to Ri z Shakir (giving\na good impression of an\nIndian) to Steve Brightman to\nNic( \"take off your trousers\") Brayshaw and finally to the\nonly Irish station master\nwith a Brummie accent,\nPete Teague himself. While\nthis was going on, John\nwas giving his Mines baby\na bottle (light ale) which\nwas a pleasant distraction\nfrom the monotony of the\noriginal plot.\nNext came Nick Wilkinson\nwith his 'Do-it-yourself,\nDo-it-yourself machine. After that came Guilds,' Boring' they shouted, and\nit was, too boring to write\nabout. Next came the climax,\nso we were led to believe, of the evening, the Stripped\nThis was a disappointment\n(no seduction of audience\nmembers etc.) a mere go-go\ndancer. 'We want Brayshaw'\nthey shouted, and so it ended.\nThe mummified Simon Chase A \"PlaygirV\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX\nGLIDING CLUB by PJ Verkroost\nThe Gliding Club finished\nlast year by rising to great\nheights (sic) at Aboyne,\nScotland, during the last two\nweeks of the summer vacation.\nIf that ort night was described\nas successful, you run out\nof adjectives for the second\nhalf of the expedition.\nThere were only five of us\nfor the second half \u2014 three\nex-students and two between\nthe status of student and\nex-student. Between us, we\nmanaged to achieve two\ndiamond heights and two\ngold heights. The only\nperson who did not manage\nanything was Jeff who had\nalready achieved his gold\nheight on a previous\nexpedition.\nIan Parker did however,\nreach a height of 25,OCX)\nfeet above the site while yours truly reached 21,000\nfeet in the Club Dart at the\nsame time and roughly the\nsame place. I broke off my\nclimb while still going up at\n400 feet per minute due to\nthe fact that my feet were\nfreezing and I was not too\nsure of where I was. Also, I was about to hit high level\ncloud and in addition could\nnot see where I was going\nbecause the canopy had\nalmost completely iced up.\nIn the event, the descent was\nstraight-forward until the\nlast 1000 feet when turbulence\nset in \u2014 they stopped launching\nwhen they saw my landing!!\nWe had two or three more\ngood days in which period\nPaul and Steve attained\ntheir gold heights. Paul, on one suspicious day,\nflew straight over Aboyne\nairfield without seeing it.\nBy the time he had re-orientated himself and turned\nround, he was too far away to\nget beck and landed in a field\ntwo miles away. The other\nfield landing was made by\nSteve who was practicing\ncloud flying \u2014 in a strong\nwind? He landed fifteen\nmiles down wind. This year has begun well\nfor the Club, this being\nessentially due to keen\nfresher s. Despite the general\nbad weather at the weekends,\nfour or five students have\nprogressed from the motor\nglider onto the engine less type. Several others are not\nfar behind.\nFor those students to\nwhom circuit bashing in\nlousy weather is not the done\nthing there has been plenty\nto do around La sham. The\ndart trailer is in the process\nof having its front end\nrebuilt (yet again!) after\nan accident on the way up\nto Scotland. We are also starting to do the C of A's on our various gliders.\nIf anyone is interested\nin joining the Club, but has\nnot so far been in touch with\nus, please come along to\none of our meetings. We\nmeet every Thursday at\n5.30pm in Aero 254 when\nwe have films or lectures\nand arrange transport down\nto Lasham for the next\nweekend. There are always\ncars go'ng down which are\navailable for lifts. If you\nare not sure about gliding\nbut would like to find out\nmore about it we can arrange\nfor you to go down for a weekend to Lasham as a guest (only social membership fee payable \u2014 50p) and have a flight or two to\nsee how your fair. Flying membership for a year is\n\u00a39.50.\nThe bonfire party at\nLasham last weekend went\noff with a roar, several\nbangs and the odd fizz.

The\nfirst of these was the\nFreshers Reception in which\nnew members of the College were introduced to the\nSociety and were able to\nmeet each other and continuing\nmembers. For a few who had\nonly recently come to Britain,\nit also served as a stepping\nstone into British Society.\nIt was conducted informally\nover drinks and snacks, and\nafterwards we featured\n\" Everlasting Glory\", a film\nwhich depicted a successful general during the time of the\nJapanese wars who suffered\nas a family man in having\nto obey orders and serve\nhis country in its best\ninterests.\nThe second event was\nthe football match played\nlast Sunday against the\nIndia Society. About 18 of\nus tru ned up in varying\ndegrees of un fitness to\nface 9 Indians. It was an\n11-a side match played on\nHarlington's worst pitch, and\ndespite being able to make\nnumerous substitutions we\nfound ourselves a goal\ndown after only a minute.\nAlthough we managed to\ndecelerate their scoring\nrate as the match wore on,\nwe found ourselves 5 \u2014 0\ndown at half-time. Afraid\nof wah t we might do with\nthe breeze behind us in the\nsecond half, the opposition\nsuggested we should play\nwith mixed sides.( No \u2014\nIndians and Chinese you\nfool!) This proved a more\neven affair despite the\nfinal score line of 5 \u2014 1 to\nthe Reds - at least some\nof us members got their\nnames on the score sheet.\n(Uh, what score sheet?).\nThis week sees the start\nof our annual competition\nagainst UC Chinese Society.\nWe shall be playing them at\nsoccer, snooker, table tennis,\nbasketball, badminton, squash,\nswimming, Chinese Chess, International Chess, bridge\nand table tennis. The\ncompetition will span about\n3 weeks, so if you have\nan aptitude for any of these\nevents please contact the\nCommittee. However, (or\nalso), if your talents have\ncontinued on page 10\n\n"

Still, I hope\nthis suggestion will be\ntreated seriously despite\nmy belief that it is not our\njob to run such services. Also I 've just heard that\nMr Mooney has invited Messrs\nTeague, Williams and myself\nto see certain aspects of\nmeal preparation \u2014 so perhaps\nwe'll have more to say later.\nNow, come on someone,\nlet's hear your views on\naccommodation problems or\nsomething \u2014 perhaps they\nmay prove less difficult\nafter discussion. Yours faithfully,\nWA GERRARD. Metallurgy PG. Sir, \u2014 The headlines of the\npast two editions of FELIX have been presented somewhat disturbingly. It seems\nthat after so many years\nof trying to emulate \"The\nSun', FELIX has finally\nfound Suitable Sensational\nNews to make these frontpage splashes. The headlines published\nwere indelicate, insensitive and crude. We believe that\nit is unsuitable for a student\nnewspaper to broadcast\npersonal tragedies in such\na way. In a small community\nsuch as IC, a newspaper\nshould be able to serve a more useful purpose than\nthe initiation of gossip.\nIf it is necessary to publish\nsuch news, it should be\npresented in a more considerate\nfashion. It appears that the\ncirculation of FELIX is\nmore important than the\nfeelings of those involved.\nYours sincerely,\nG K NIEUWE NHU IJ SJ l KAHN J L LAWRENCE Physics3( Whilst I applaud your\nsense of morale justice, It eel that on this occ as sion you are being misled by it.\nI would contend the use of the\nadjectives \"indelicate\",\n\"insensitive\" and \"crude\"\nwith regard to the two stories\nyou refer to.\nOn the contrary, they\nwere t actual and to the point\nand in the first instance,\nhelped to destroy any\nunfounded rumours being\nspread at the time. I would\ndraw your attention to the\nfact that, in the second\nstory concerning a girl being\nraped, the so-called sun \u2014\ntype sensational story was\nin essence an announcement\nappeal ling for witnesses\nwho may yet be crucial in\nhelping to solve the case.\nThe circulation of FELIX,\nthough a factor in determining\nthe content of the paper to an\nextent, is not more important\nthan peoples' lee ling s.I thank you for your\nmissive and suggest that in\nfuture you read our\n'sensational' front page\nstories a little more carefully\nbe tore giving air to your\ncritical talents \u2014 Ed.).\nSir, \u2014 May I congratulate\nyou on the considerate way\nyou have dealt with two\nrather sensitive stories in\nthe last two issues of\nFELIX. I refer of course to\nto the resident dying in\nLinstead Hall and the sad\ncase of a girl being raped\nat IC.\nMany editors would be\ntempted to delve deep into\nthe background of these\nstories, presenting a sensationalist, crude and\nhurtful imitation of the\nSun, News of the World etc. Instead you have presented\nthe plain facts and nothing\nmore. You even had the\ncourtesy not to mention the\nnames of those involved.\nYours sincerely,\nCLIVE DEWEY.

Three intrepid\ngirls set off in search of it,\narriving back at IF just in\ntime to be hoisted up onto\nthe 40 foot lowry. Arriving at\nthe back of IC, we were\njoined by several members of\nthe jazz club, who played\ngallantly throughout the\nproceedings. We were then\nsteered quickly towards the\nother floats and the Michelin bus parked on Imperial\nInstitute Road, and off we\nwent towards High St Ken. and many shocked onlookers \u2014\nmind you, I don't suppose\nyou do see Michelin buses\nand floats every day of the\nweek!\nDespite the weather, the\nshoppers were out and about\nand few escaped the money-grabbing collections from\nIC and IF \u2014 well done lads\nand lasses!

    "content": "FEU X13 Reviews Concerts\nGong/Clear Light Orchestra (Great Hall)\nIan Morse\nAttracting the largest audience yet\nseen at IC this session, Gong went a long way toward making the gig also the most musically satisfying.\nThey seemed much stronger than\nthe last time I saw them a few months\nago, with regard to the direction their\nmusic should take, probably finally\nshaking off the after effects of the\ndeparture of mentor and guiding light,\nDaevid Allen. Although it would be\nunfair to say that the band has improved\nsince the leaving of Allen, it would be\ntrue to say that under the assumed\nleadership of Steve Hill age, they are\nconcentrating to a greater degree on\nthe instrumental side of their ideology,\nbreaking away from Allen's often\nmono manic obsession with lyrics about\npot-head pixies, flying teapots and\nother esoteric peculiarities of the\nplanet Gong.\nWhether or not you are able to get\noff fully on the band's music depends\nas much as anything on the type of\ngrass that grows at the bottom of your\ngarden, but even so one could not help\nbut appreciate the fine musicianship displayed by the band during a set that\nincluded material mostly from ' YOU' and\n' FISH RISING', as well as some new,\nunrecorded tunes. Particularly elevating\nwas flautist/saxophonist DidierMalherbe,\nwho as well as having a sure technique,\ndisplayed a fine melodic sense throughout,\nespecially with his use of an Echoplex\nduring his oriental ly inspired flute\nfeature. Hillage too, was as tastefully\neconomic with his guitar work as ever,\nwhilst what seems at last to be a per men ant rhythm section laid down\na solid, inventive foundation for the\nrest of the musicians to build on. After\na performance that lasted almost ninety\nminutes, the suitably impressed audience\nbrought them back for a deserved\nencore.\nIf Gong's music was a well executed\nas it was conceived, the same cannot\nbe said of the support act. Clear Light\nOrchestra seemed to be a band with\nadmirable intentions but lack the\nmusical capacity to carry them off.\nAttempting to emulate the innovator y ensembles of the past few years,\nthe obvious influence of Lifetime and\nto a lesser degree Matching Mole could\nbe heard protruding through the\nConglomeration of sound they produced\nduring the two over-long pieces played.\nThey had neither the musicianship nor\nthe intelligence to pull them through, the\noverall effect being a muffled psu edo complex whole, at their nadir (which\nthey seemed to arrive at with excruciating\nregularity) giving the impression of\nblind men wading through a torrent of\nturd.\nNB Special mention should go to\nAndy and his henchmen, who handled\nthe affair with typical panache. These\nhard working lads of the Ents Committee\ndeserve all the credit they have told\nme to give them. Always the height of\ndiplomacy and decorum, they work hard\nday and night in order to make the\nSaturday night concerts a success. Why,\noften I have seen them outside concert\nhalls throughout London, shivering in\nthe cold night air, with handouts\ndepicting coming events at IC, relentless\nin their task ...\n(Alright, enough of this crawling \u2014 Ed.)\nTheatre\n\"The Playboy of the Western World\"\nFor those of you who, like me, had\nSynge's \"The Playboy of the Western\nWorld\" rammed down your throats at\nschool, the best antidote has just\njoined the National Theatre's repertoire,\nin their last season at the Old Vic the company gives an electric performance\nof this Irish Classic. The basic plot is simple, Christopher\nMahon arrives in a remote village on\nthe West coast of Ireland and is pressed\nto admit that he has killed his father\nwith one blow of his spade. Instead\nof turning him over to the police, the\ninnocent inhabitants make him a hero\nand two women propose marriage.\nNeedless to say his father arrives\nand when this is i made public the\nadmiration of the hero turns to angry\ncontempt, di spite Christy' s success in carrying off all the prizes at the\nlocal sports.\nAt the first performances in Dublin\nby JM Synge The National Theal\nin 1907 riots were organised by the\nNationalists, angry at Synge's portrayal\nof Irish peasants as unfaithful and\nharbour ers of murderers. Unfortunately\nthey missed the point that, at that\ntime, the Irish peasantry were de-moral is ed, scraping a meagre existence\noff the barren ground, and ready to look\nfor a hero in any likely candidate.\nStephen Re a, perhaps better known\nas the taciturn Carter Brandon in the\nBBC's recent comedy series, \"/ Didn't Know You Cared\", plays a similar\ncharacter in Christy, particularly\neffective when the locals are pressing\nhim to find put why he is behaving\nwith such reticence.H is total bewilderment\nat the situation in which he finds\nhimself is another variation on the\nvictim as hero, for, despite a knowledge\nof his wrongdoing, the audience is\npersuaded to see him as hero too. A situation made all the more credible\nAt The Old Vic by the remoteness of the setting.\nIf the thought of mock Irish accents\nworries you, then you need have no\nfears for almost the entire cast is\nIrish and, although the sense is sometimes\ndifficult to follow the sound is sheer\npoetry. The language Synge uses is\nauthentic, for he spent several seasons\nin the Aran Islands at the suggestion of\nWB Yeats. One of the most effective parts of\nthe play is the description of the races.\nThe set is ingeniously designed so that the characters can go outside the\nthe cottage, where the\" main action\ntakes place and provide a running\ncommentary of the events on the sands\nbelow. Geoffrey Scott's attention to\ndetail is terrific.\nStudents' standby tickets may be\navailable from 6.30pm for 90p. Thomas Stevenson\n\"Song Of Asia\" Westminster Theatre\nWithout prior knowledge or\na fair amount of diligence, it\nwould be almost impossible\nto discover the existence of\nthis show, which runs until\nNovember 29th, Wednesdays\nto Saturdays only. The common\npublicity channels seem to\nbe i ono ring it, although the\nChristmas show at the same\ntheatre is already being\nadvertised. However, those\nwho bother to make the short\njourney to Victoria will be\nrewarded with a captivating\nevening.\nThe idea for this musical\nsprang from the 'Ceasefire'\ntwo and a half years ago in\nVietnam. Young Asians meeting at the Moral Rearmament\nCentre in Panchgari, India\nfelt that more fundamental\nremedies were needed in\nAsia, and decided to present\ntheir ideas through a combination of dance, music\nand drama. The show has\nappeared in India, Vietnam and\nLaos, and arrives in England\nat the end of a six-month\ntour of Europe. The members\nof the cast, 45 in all, are\nunpaid, and many had given\nup their possessions to be\nwith the show.\nThis being so, it was no\nsurprising that one of the\nfirst things that strikes you\nabout the musical is the\nconviction with which the\ncast convey their ideas. The short scenes, which are\nlinked by bouts of amusing\nrepartee between a naive\nyoung Indian and an old\nsage, are mainly drawn from\nthe real-life experiences\nof members of the cast, and\ndepict moments of crisis, where decisions based on\nhate and deceit are readily\ntaken, which lead inevitably\nto further pain and suffering.\nThe examples taken range\nfrom petty family squabbles\nto matters involving large\ncommunities, as in the\nPapua copper dispute. In\nthe climax, a story about the\nceasefire in Vietnam, a villager who has seen his two brothers shot down\nmercilessly by guerillas is torn between seeking revenge,\nand trying to reason with\nthe killers.\"/// have the\ncourage to kill a man\", he\nsays, \"why can'tI have the\ncourage to love him enough\nto make him different\".\nIt is this feeling which runs\nthroughout the musical, and\nis reflected in the songs\nand dancing.\nThe music is provided by\nan authentic collection of\nAsian instruments, the\nmusicians loo o king rather\ncramped in the small box\nprovided, but sounding\nexcellent, and the dances,\nderiving from a wide variety\n\n"

NUS President Charles\nClarke said he wanted the\ngovernment to answer two\nspecific charges: \" Firstly, that the Rate Support Grant\nfor next year, which is due\nto be announced today, will be so low as to drive some\nlocal authorities into bank-rup t cy, or enforce massive\nredundancies. I don't know\nif Mr Mulley and the other\nsocial services ministers\nare putting up any kind of\nfight against the Treasury\nand Mr Cro s land; but unless\nthese cuts are stopped, they\nwill he presiding over the\ndestruction of education\nand social services as we\nknow them.\n\" Secondly, that plans for\nmassive spending cuts have\nbeen drawn up and top\nCivil Servants are working\non ways to carve over \u00a3130\nmillion from higher education\nalone in the course of one\nyear. That would mean the\nclosure of many more colleges and their departments, the\nredundancy of thousands\nof staff in all jobs within\nthe higher education sector.\nUndoubtedly, the already\nweakening condition of\nstudent support would receive\nyet one more body blow.*'\nThe secrecy surrounding\nthese proposals reminded Mr\nClarke of \" The hatchet job\nwhich destroyed the Colleges of Education\". He demanded\nan end of secrecy. \" Last week the International\nMonetary Fund lent \u00a3975\nmillion to the British Government. What kind of guarantees\nwere given in return?\" Mr Clarke added:\n\" It may be that some\nform of short-term relief\nwill arise to stop the worst\neffects. Whatever the\nsituation the public has a right to know what is going\non.\n\" I challenge Mr Mulley\nto deny absolutely that the\nnew Rate Support Grant will force even more swinging\ncutbacks. Will he give a categorical assurance that\nthere will be no more\ncuts in educational expenditure\nfor next year or subsequent\nones?\n\" If these measures do\ngo forward, local councillors must refuse to implement\nthem; staff must not be\nlaid off; courses must not\nbe closed; students' grants\nmust continue to be paid. If that means that the council\nmust look for support from\nthe people who elected them\nin pursuing a collision course\nwith the government, then I am convinced that they will get it. Certainly those of us\nin student unions will do\nwhatever we can.\" New Domestic Secretary\nappointed\nCaptain JWG Lindley, RN, has been appointed to the\nrecently created post of\nDomestic Secretary. He\nassumes his duties next\nMonday, 24th November 1975.\nCaptain Lindley served in\nthe Navy for thirty i six years\nbefore retiring to take \u2022 the\npost of Domestic Secretary.\nHe served in both World War\ntwo and the Korean War and\nfrom 1973\u201475 was Captain in\nCommand of HMS Cochrane,\nthe Fleet Accommodation\nCentre at Rosyth, Scotland.\nAs Domestic Secretary,\nCaptain Lindley will, be\nresponsible for the domestic\nside of the College's activities.

Mr\nAhlers, who has only been\nin office for nine weeks,\nresigned last Wednesday. In\nhis presidential column in\n' Gui id sheet', published yesterday, he says \" Academic reasons have left me no\noption but to resign as\nPresident of City and Guilds Union for the session1975/76. Naturally this is a great\nwrench for me...\" The Guilds executive met\nlast night to discuss the\nsituation.\nMany people in the Union\n(both ICU and C& GU) have\nexpressed their regret at\nhis departure.\ntitbits mI thought we'd start off by taking a look at presidential\nbicycles.

    "content": "8\nmix Morphy Day\nON THE21 st March 1920, an RSM rowing eight beat C&G over\na one mile course; this was the first time the colleges had raced\nsince the revival of their individual rowing clubs after the 1st| Warld War. Mr Arthur Morphy, father of the Guilds' stroke,\nDonal W Morphy, presented a cup which he had donated for the\noccasion. The race became known\nas the Morphy Cup Race, to\nbe competed for on MORPHY DAY. Over the years, a side-event has become more\npopular, and now attracts\nmore spectators than the\nactual boat races. This event is the battle between\nCity and Guilds and a combined RCS/ RS M team\nfor an oar \u2014 the Morphy\nOar. There are few rules for\nthe contest. The partaking\nteams line-up, facing each\nother on the tow-path along i side the Thames at Putney; about\nhalf a mile upstream from\nthe College boat house. The\nthree presidents of the\nConstituent College Unions\nexchange \" pies\" and the\nbattle begins; the winners\nbeing the posses or s of the\noar when the combatants\nhave run out of missiles, drop 'dead' from exhaustion,\nor are overcome by the\npervading odour s. Thus the scene was set\nfor this year's event. RCS/ RSM, the holders from last\nyear, were clearly the\nfavour i ties this time due to\ntheir superiority in numbers\nover the opposition, City\nand Guilds. They outnumbered Guilds by two to\none.\nGuilds morale was nevertheless high; they were\nclearly relying on quality\nrather than quantity.\nThe rival groups stood\npoised, confronting each\nother across a fifty feet gap.\nThe thr.ee C CU presidents\nassembled in the middle, and\nthe adjudicator Mr John\nDowns, gave the signal\nto exchange pies and begin\nthe battle.\nMr Downs, unfortunately\nwas towards the river, and\ndid not notice, passing behind\nhim, a member of the public.\nThe Fates had contrived to\ntake the poor innocent on a walk along the tow-path, and\nto bring him between the\nopposing forces at precisely\nthe moment the action\nbegan. He probably backs\nlosing horses as well, such\nis life! Immediately, he\ndisappeared, as did everyone\nelse, under a thick, black\ncloud of carbon black and\nflour, dense with projectiles.\nWhen the cloud lifted,\nit was obvious (from the\nsmell), that both sides had\nbeen slowly preparing for\nweeks beforehand.\nThe superiority in numbers\ntold almost immediately;\nC&G being driven back, but\nfighting a courageous rear\nguard action. Meanwhile,\nthe oar was being removed\nby RSM.\nRelentlessly, RCS added\ninsult to injury by acquiring\nGuilds tug-o' war rope which\nwas tied around two trees.\nHumiliation stirred Guilds into action and they launched\na counter attack, which\nwas quickly quo shed. Guilds periodically surged forward,\nbut each time were held, the\nsurges grew weaker, like\nan ebb tide, and the initial\nfavourites undoubtedly won\nthe Day.\nThe police arrived during\nthis epic struggle and looked\non with amused tolerance,\nfrom the safety of a panda\ncar parked 200 yards away.\nThey finally became bored\nand drove away.\nA small break with\ntradition occurred outside the\nCollege Boat House after\nthe main Battle. Alf' s Imperial Army massed their\nwhole strength and marched\ndown the road in a rowdy\nmob of seven. Guildsmen,\nMiners and Scientists lingering\noutside the Boat House,\nincensed, forgot their previous\ndifferences and Alf' s Army\nfinished their march in the\nriver. RCS, in really acquisitive\nmood, purloined Alf' s flag.\nPleased with their efforts,\nseveral members of RCS rounded the day off with tea\nat Harrod's. Sad to relate, therefore,\nthat Donald W Morphy, who\nwas a keen Old Centralian,\nand later became famous as\nhalf of \"Morphy Richards\", died earlier this year. His Day\nis perpetual memorial.\nDavid Hopkins Results of trie Boat Races Ladies1. RC S2.C&G3. RSM\nMorphy Cup\n1. C& G2.RC S3. RSM\nLowry\n1. C& G2.RC S3. RSM\nRugby\n1 .RSM\n2.
