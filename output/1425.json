The first set was\ntight up until the midway point, with\nboth teams exchanging point after\npoint.\nImperial began to impose themselves\non the opposition with some heavy hits\nand tight defence. An excellent serving run by playmaker Ashly Devon\nBlack raced Imperial into an unassailable lead and they ran out 25-18 win-ners.

They\ndid, and produced an emphatic set of\nvolleyball winning 25-8.\nFrench phD student Amelie Seguret\nwas in scintillating form, demonstrating a great range of attacks from strong\nhits to deft drop shots. First year Linda\nVaccari was also impressive as middle\nhitter, showing great determination\nand immense blocking ability. More\nserving pressure from Barbara Kiskovski saw Exeter fail to reach double\nfigures.\nIn the third set, a few unforced errors\ncrept into the Imperial game and Exeter started somewhat of a fight back.\nAt one point the opposition were 19-15 ahead.\nTime-outs called by Head Coach\nBALSAMO gave the team a chance\nto regroup and begin their own trademark comeback. They fought their way\nback into the decisive set with some\nreal hustle.\nFirst year Jen Smith produced some\ncrucial winners and overall had impressive hitting stats, using the ball intelligently every time.\nImperial edged it 25-23 to complete\nan impressive and historic victory.\nWith BUCS volleyball giants Loughborough sensationally knocked out by\nDundee University, the finals in Sheffield are wide open and Imperial will\nbe challenging for the prestigious title.\nThe other qualifying universities are\nBath, Birmingham, Durham, Leeds,\nManchester and Oxford.\nTable Tennis\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st 9\nBournemouth University 1st 5\nTennis\nMen\u2019s 2nd 0\nBrunel University 1st 10\nBUCS Cup\nWomen\u2019s 1st 5\nUniversity of Gloucestershire 1st 5\n(Gloucestershire win on tie-break shoot out)\nVolleyball\nWomen\u2019s 2nd 0\nUniversity of Essex 1st 3\nSaturday 21st February\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU vs Royal Holloway 2s ULU\nMen\u2019s 2s ULU vs Queen Mary 1s ULU\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs UCL 3s ULU\nMen\u2019s 7s ULU vs St George\u2019s 3s ULU\nULU Cup\nMen\u2019s 4s vs King\u2019s College 2s\nMen\u2019s 5s vs King\u2019s College 4s\nSunday 22nd February\nLacrosse\nMixed 1s ULU vs UCL Mixed 1s ULU\nRugby\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU vs King\u2019s College 1s ULU\nMonday 23rd February\nBasketball\nMen\u2019s 1s ULU vs SOAS 1s ULU\nMen\u2019s 2s ULU vs UCL 2s ULU\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU vs LSE 1s ULU\nWomen\u2019s 3s ULU vs LSE 7s ULU\nSquash\nULU Cup\nWomen\u2019s 1s ULU vs RUMS 1s ULU\nWater Polo\nMixed 1s ULU vs UCL Mixed 1s ULU\nWednesday 25th February\nFencing\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Northumbria University 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs University of Cambridge 1st\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 3s ULU vs King\u2019s College 1s ULU\nHockey\nMen\u2019s 3rd vs Royal Holloway 2nd\nMen\u2019s 4th vs University of Portsmouth 4th\nSquash\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st vs University of Birmingham 1st\nWomen\u2019s 1st vs LSE 1st\nTable Tennis\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Cardiff University 1st\nTennis\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st vs UCL 3rd\nMen\u2019s 2nd vs London Metropolitan University 3rd\nVolleyball\nBUCS Cup\nMen\u2019s 1st vs Oxford Brookes University 1st\nWomen\u2019s 2nd vs King\u2019s College 1st\nin association with Sports Partnership\n19 Speak in support of cad, veto a\npunishment.

It truly is... A week of passionate sport and long lived traditions starts here in felix as 25 February\n2009, Varsity approaches. First off however, a brief introduction to The Bottle match.\nNow in its 107th year, the annual Bottle Match between the Royal School of\nMines (RSM) of Imperial College and\nthe Camborne School of Mines (CSM)\nof the University of Exeter is the second oldest varsity match in the world.\nThe link between RSM and CSM is\nthought to have formed in the 18501870\u2019s when the two schools were established and became the two premier\nmining schools in the country, and indeed the world.\nThe first recorded RSM vs CSM\nrugby match was played on the 16th\nDecember 1902 and though it was described as an honourable draw, we are\nunsure of the score.\nSince then the match has taken place\nevery year, and was named the Bottle\nMatch in 1946 when some RSM students procured a 3 ft beer bottle from\na Bass lorry and this was made the\ntrophy.\nIt was adorned with the crests of the\ntwo schools, one on each side, and is\ncurrently displayed in the Union bar as\nthe RSM were victorious in 2008.\nOf the recorded matches, RSM have\nwon the rugby 39 times, CSM 33 times,\nand there have been six draws.\nIn the case of a draw, the winning\nteam from the previous years match\nkeeps the Bottle.\nThis year the RSM are fielding 77\nathletes playing golf, squash, Hhckey\n(men\u2019s and women\u2019s), football and\nmen\u2019s rugby.\nThe competition will be at home this\nyear, starting today (Friday 20 February) with an afternoon of golf out at\nTrent Park, followed by squash, which\nstarts at 7.30pm in Ethos.\nIt\u2019s an early start at Harlington on\ntomorrow for the hockey players with\nthe ladies match at 9.00am.\nThis is followed by back to back\nmen\u2019s hockey and football and then fi-nally, at 2pm, the all important rugby\nmatch!\nAfter showers it is back to South\nKensington for the Players\u2019 Dinner and\nthe always-entertainig awards ceremony in dB\u2019s from 9.00pm.\nThe Bottle Match has, and always\nwill be, the main annual event for the\nRSM because of its tradition and the\npassion that surrounds it.\nThis year, not only do we have the\nlargest pool of players from which our\ncaptains have been able to pick from,\nbut also the most supporters we have\never had by a long way!\nEveryone is now ready to smash\nCamborne apart and we plan to make\nthis trip to London one they\u2019d rather\nforget! Watch this space\u2026\nTimothy Chalk\nAlana and her charges prepare for another well rehearsed move\nWill RSM return back to dominance on Saturday? They have won 10 of the last 11 encounters\n\n"

This was\nmost definitely a time where children\nwere seen and not heard, and babies\nwere delivered by the Stork, as shown\nby the innocent Wendla Bergman. But\nfor some it was also a time of Bohemianism and discovering who one was \u2013\nrepresented by our hero Melchior Gabor. We follow the characters as they\ngo hurtling towards adulthood with\ndire consequences, in a world where\nthe adults keep their children blinkered from reality until it is too late.\nThe stage of the Lyric is the perfect\nsize for Spring Awakening, creating the appearance that the set could\nburst free from the stage at any time.\nThe set, like many aspects of Spring\nAwakening, at first appears simple and\nnondescript but on further inspection is chaotically quirky and detailed.\nFavourite set pieces include a giant\nbutterfly and a blackboard listing the\nmusical numbers with suitable graf-fiti. Everything is on stage including\na live acoustic-rock band and a small\nportion of the audience. At present\nthese on-stage seats cost \u00a315 on the\nday and give a completely different\nview of the show although you may\nmiss some parts. As compensation\nyou get to sit among the actors and\nexperience the action up close. I loved\nhow the whole lot was integrated on\nstage, with actors jumping amongst\nthe audience and even playing a song\nor two on the upright piano. And the\nlights! I\u2019ve never been so obsessed\nwith lights. We switch between a vast\nI\nhad a stressful journey into college today. I was running a little\nlate (read: hungover) so I decided to get the bus instead of my\nusual brisk walk. This managed\nto lengthen my journey time. Firstly,\nthere\u2019s a set of roadworks at the traffic lights near South Ken station that\nare pure evil, meaning my bus sat outside the Royal Marsden hospital for a\ngood 15 minutes. At this point I was\n\u201cfortunate\u201d enough to watch a Harrods van deliver Jade Goody\u2019s wedding\ndress, with the paparazzi swarming.\nAnyway, eventually my bus reached\nSouth Ken and I realised I was in the\nmidst of the sheer horror that is HALF\nTERM. Argh, it was vicious out there.\nThe streets were awash with screaming\nankle biters and over-sized, cup-holder\nwielding pushchairs. The queues for\nthe Natural History Museum and the\nScience Museum were not only merg-ing, but doubled back on each other\nso the ends were impossible to iden-tify. The pavements of Exhibition Road\nwere so full of mummies, daddies and\nkiddies that I had to walk in the road\nwith cars honking at me just to get to\ncollege. Because obviously if I am not\na kidlet, a mother or heavily pregnant,\nthen I am not entitled to pavement.\nIt\u2019s a shame that Britain\u2019s parents\ndon\u2019t have enough imagination to go\nsomewhere other than the Science Museum or Natural History Museum. Or\nrather, as I overheard on the same bus\nthis morning, just the Natural History\nMuseum because the Science Museum\nEmily Wilson\nArts Editor\n\u201cdoesn\u2019t have much stuff in it\u201d.\nI am not trying to say that children\nshould be banned from museums and\nart galleries. I got where I am today\n(hungover, studying fungus, in debt,\nsoon to be unemployed\u2026) because I\nspent my weekends being taken round\nNational Trust properties and V&A ex-hibitions. I have a very distinct memory of getting out of the car on Exhibition Road to go the Science Museum,\nlooking up and saying \u201cwhat\u2019s Imperial\nCollege?\u201d and my Mummy saying \u201cit\u2019s\na university where very clever people\nlearn about science\u201d. And here I am.\nMy point is: don\u2019t go to museums\nand art galleries at half term. It\u2019s hell.\nYes, for the first time ever, I am telling\nthe students of Imperial NOT to go see\nnice artsy cultural things. Save it for an\nodd weekend or a day off lectures in\nabout a month\u2019s time.\nWhich brings me to telling you about\nsome of the very exciting stuff soon to\nbe arriving in London. Already on at\nthe Royal Academy is an exhibition\non the architect Andrea Palladio. By\nthe time you read this, \u201cVan Dyck and\nBritain\u201d will have opened at Tate Britain. Opening on 25th February is the\nNational Gallery exhibition \u201cPicasso:\nChallenging the Past\u201d. The V&A are\ndisplaying an anthology of hats from\nnext week, and will have an exhibition\non Baroque in April. Phew. If you\u2019d be\ninterested in reviewing any of those,\nor you\u2019ve got something in mind that\nI\u2019ve neglected to mention, email us and\nwe\u2019ll get you in for free.\nStep away from\nthe art\nsea of lightbulbs to represent reality\nand harsh neon lighting that extends\ninto the auditorium during the musical numbers.\nThe general premise of the show is\nthat these period characters sing contemporary songs suited to the MySpace\ngeneration. Sheik and Slater have cleverly interwoven everything \u2013 songs and\nstory, old and new. The characters use\nhandheld microphones to convey their\nfeelings and the entire stage takes on an\nelectric charge as they jump and leap\naround. The choreography is not your\nusual high kicking fare as Bill T Jones\nhas created a jerky style that fits brilliantly into the angsty feel of the show.\nThe music has a definite rock edge to\nit with some clever lyrics borrowing\nboth from the original text and modern teenage language (although I think\nthe phrase \u201cMy Junk\u201d may have disappeared a few years ago). I can\u2019t think of\na single song I didn\u2019t like, even songs\nthat didn\u2019t thrill me on the soundtrack\nsuddenly made perfect sense within the\nstory. Highlights include \u201cTouch Me\u201d \u2013\na hauntingly beautiful and poetic song\nabout masturbation (why do all the\nbest songs have to be about something\ndodgy?) and \u201cTotally Fucked!\u201d a rousing rock anthem about how shit life is.\nIt felt so good to hear the songs live as\nthe CD just doesn\u2019t live up to the real\nexperience.\nThe teenage cast of Spring Awakening could out-act most on the West\nEnd. Aneurin Barnard as Melchior and\nCharlotte Wakefield as Wendla portray\nthe loss of innocence without straying\ninto clich\u00e9. They are never contrived\nor annoying, as many young characters seem to be on stage, although we\ndecided Barnard\u2019s sex face left a little\nto be desired. Iwan Rheon was incredible as Moritz. He gave off a Brit-Rock\nvibe while also maintaining a feeling of\ndespair as his character plummeted toA trip to the theatre you\u2019ll Enjoy\nCaz Knight sees Alan Bennett\u2019s Enjoy \u2013 two and a half hours of far-fetched witty commentary on 80s\nworking class culture, complete with trouser-based comedy and roaring northern accents\nT\nhe audiences of 1980, fond\nof and accustomed to\ntheir view of what an Alan\nBennett play should be,\nwere disappointed when\nEnjoy came to the West End \u2013 despite\nthe celebrity cast and its endorsement\nby well-known actors. Expecting a\nstraightforward northern comedy, they\nwere offered something absurd and ex-pressionistic. The playwright\u2019s humorous writing, this time interwoven with\nsome poignant commentary on working class pride, heritage culture, life in\nLeeds\u2019 back-to-backs and socio-politi-cal phenomena, that turned out to be\nquite prophetic: the ASBO-generation\nand New Labour jargon.\nIn his preceding plays, Bennett enjoyed success with works such as Beyond The Fringe, The Madness of\nGeorge III and Kafka\u2019s Dick. Having\ndrawn on autobiographical experience\nof the bulldozing of the back-to-back\nhouses (now no longer a feature of\nworking-class housing estates in Britain\u2019s cities) in several television dra-mas, Bennett decided it was time to set\na play in such an environment.\nIn today\u2019s Britain, reverse snobbery\noccurs frequently, with those who have\ndone well for themselves emphasising\ntheir working class routes while those\nfrom affluent and \u2018cushy\u2019 backgrounds\nB\neing a bit of a theatre geek,\nI had high expectations\nof Spring Awakening. I\u2019ve\nhad the cast recording for\na year now and followed its\nprogress on Broadway with a yearning for it to come to England. Instead\nof opening straight onto a depleted\nWest End, Spring Awakening has had\na somewhat subdued premiere at the\nHammersmith Lyric. Based on Frank\nWedekind\u2019s forbidden play, Spring\nAwakening combines what was, at the\ntime, a radical story, with contemporary rock by Duncan Sheik. Apparently Sheik is something of a rock star\nin America, but I must admit I hadn\u2019t\nheard of him until Spring Awakening.\nHe has teamed up with poet/writer\nSteven Sater to create something that\nhasn\u2019t been seen in theatre for a long\nIwan Rheon as Moritz. Lucy wants to take him home in her pocket\nMam is played by Alison Steadman, of Pride and Prejudice fame\nscorned for their unfair advantage.\nBennett cannot be accused of celebrating his blue-collar heritage, and in Enjoy even pokes fun at this working class\nsentimentality through Mam\u2019s desire\nto cling onto their back-to-back and\nneighbourhood that comes with it, but\nat the same time always aspiring to the\nideal of being classy and moving up\nin the world. Representing the city\u2019s\nurge for modernisation is Dad, who\ndoes nothing but complain about their\ndowdy living conditions and fantasise\nabout their shiny, new maisonette.\nA letter arrives from the council asking that a sociologist observe them at\nhome in their normal day-to-day life,\nas part of a survey on neighbourliness\nand happiness in the community.\nThe first half, witty as it is, gets off to\na slow start and by the end one wonders whether this dysfunctionally comical snapshot of northern family life is\ngoing anywhere.\nThe second half explodes into a\nhectic and energy-brimming series\nof events, each one more far-fetched\nthan the next with the jokes getting\ndirtier and earning progressively more\nroars of laughter from the audience.\nNot only this, but its emotional potency and Bennett\u2019s messages are put\nacross much more clearly and suc-cessfully, earning it a lot more weight\nand respect as a play and for its entertainment value. There were moments\nwhen the elderly Mrs Clegg tried in\nvain to remove the supposedly-dead\nDad\u2019s trousers off him, all the while\nseeming as though fellating him, that\nhad one cringe a bit given the age of\nboth actors and audience, but laughs\nit got. The sadness at the thought of\nhomes that instilled happiness, a sense\nof community and pride (much of this\nlost in today\u2019s Britain) being ripped\napart was conveyed and served to give\nbalance to the previously silly slapstick\ncomedy, as well bring home clearly the\nloss that was experienced during the\n70s plight to modernise.\nTrue to style, Bennett devised the\ncharacters first before concentrating\non the themes. And the cast utterly\ndoes justice to Bennett\u2019s creations. All\nof them loud and larger than life are\nplayed superbly with unfaltering Leeds\naccents (one American lady behind me\ncomplained of being unable to understand a lot of what was said!). After her\nprevious role as Mrs Bennett in BBC\u2019s\n1995 production of Pride and Prejudice (the better one), Alison Steadman is perfect for playing the none-too-clever, optimistic Mam while the\ngruff, grumbling Dad, played by David\nTroughton, adds a glorious contrast to\nhis wife.\nThe age-old parent/offspring rivalry\nissue is fueled by another great performance from Josie Walker as the\ndaughter with loose morals, Linda,\nwith reference to the 80s social environment in Gregory the skinhead\nsporting Dr Marten boots, no less.\nAlan Bennett has succeeded, albeit\n28 years after its creation, in compelling us to \u2018enjoy\u2019 this play: we should\nremember that a play is play, it should\nbe fun and it should be playful, he says.\nThis is theatre at its least contrived,\nleast academic and most jovial. Although two hours and a half gave me\nmy fill of booming, northern accents\nfor the night!\nEnjoy is on at the Gielgud Theatre\nuntil 14th May\nDad, played by David Troughton, in a handsome set of braces\nward failure; I just wanted to take him\nhome in my pocket!\nI\u2019ve loved Spring Awakening for a\nwhile now and so was really apprehensive about what the Lyric would do to\nit. What they have done is made it a\nsublime, funny, poignant and rocking\nnew musical that is going to take some\nbeating. Many people will come for the\nshock factor of swearing, sex and the\nodd bit of nudity, but I hope they can\nsee beyond that to find a really clever\ncombination of classic storytelling,\nmodern music and choreography with\nsome amazing new talent to portray it.\nFor the first time in a long while I\u2019ve\nfound I show I want to see again and\nagain and I think I\u2019ll find something\nnew and fresh about it every time.\nSpring Awakening is on at the\nHammersmith Lyric until March\n14th Aneurin Barnard, playing Melchior, could out-act most of the West End\n\n"

Counts of bringing the name of Imperial College Union into disrepute were made against\nthem after their actions last November.\nBack in November, felix reported the\nactions of the Club, as well as the allegations that landlords and residents\nhad made against them [Issue 1416 -27.11.08] which included damages in\nexcess of \u00a31,400 to property and artefacts around the local area of the pubs.\nThe disciplinary hearing, which was\nheld last Tuesday [10.02.09], released\nits verdict finding the individuals and\nthe Club guilty of the charges brought\nagainst them.\nThe individuals, who shall not be\nnamed, were fined various amounts\nranging from \u00a335 to \u00a380, whilst the\nclub will be forced to pay for any damage caused during the evening, the final amount being known once the final\ninvoice comes in. In addition to the\nfin, the club will also have to do a total of 200 hours of community service\nbetween a minimum of 20 members,\nto be completed before the 24th April\n2009.\nThe Union Disciplinary Board have\ndecided that all individuals against\nwhom charges were brought (those\nwho had caused the majority of the\ndamage), bar one, were not eligible to\ncarry out the community service as\nthey had paid a fine to the Union. Deputy President (Club & Societies) Lily\nTopham, who was also the chief pros-ecutor, commented that she \u201cdidn\u2019t understand why the decision was made to\nexclude the individuals from the community service.\u201d\nQuestions have also been raised\nover how the disciplinary hearing\nwas conducted. All the individuals\nwho had charges made against them\nhad received notification of the hear-ing, as well as the full list of charges in\nwriting and the Disciplinary Court\u2019s\nprocedure.\nAlthough the individuals had received all of this information, ICUAFC\nClub Captain James Skeen who was\nthere as the club\u2019s representative, has\ntold felix that he hadn\u2019t received any\nof the information, apart from the no-tification, before the hearing date, and\ninstead had very little time to review\nhis rights.\nThe Union Disciplinary Procedure,\nwhich is not located on the Disciplinary Matters page on the web site but\nfound in the Union Constitution, outlines the rights of the accused, which\ninclude calling for witnesses as well as\ngrounds for appeal. There have also\nbeen rumours that Imperial College\nhas placed pressure on the Union to act\nswiftly over the matter, as their actions\nhad apparently dented the reputation\nof the College and its students.\nWhatever the decision might be for\nthe football club, the one thing that remains is the method by which this was\nall done. The hearing and its proceedings were kept away from the rest of\nthe student population, with the only\nstudent input coming from the Royal\nCollege of Science Union [RCSU] Motor Club who were the only students to\ngive evidence of the apparent tarnishing of the College\u2019s reputation.\nMr Skeen told felix \u201cWe feel that the\npunishment is suitably harsh considering the proximity to the exams and are\nnow focused on humbly carrying out\nour punishment.\u201d One of the suggested\ncommunity services include repainting the changing rooms at Harlington\nSports Ground, which will come as a\nnice present to other teams.\nMany have heralded the Union\u2019s decision as a move in the right direction\nafter the numerous complaints the club\nhas received over the past few years.\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk News\nNew International Students\u2019 Officer elected\nSaki Onda will be the first ever International Students\u2019 Officer for Imperial College Union. This new position,\nwhich was only formed a couple of\nmonths ago through Council, aims to\nincrease the representation of the vast\ninternational community at Imperial.\nNearly 46% of the students graduating\nlast year were deemed non-UK, and\nwith such a large proportion, Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare) Hannah Theodorou felt it appropriate to\ncreate the new role.\nMiss Onda, who has a seat on the\nUnion Council now, was unfortunately\nnotpresentatthemeetingthisMonday.\nfelix asked Miss Theodorou what she\nwould like the Miss Onda to achieve,\nto which she answered \u201cThe InternaJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\ntional Students\u2019 Officer is supposed to\nbe the representative voice of the international community at Imperial.\n\u201cOne of their main tasks will be to facilitate an international students forum\nwhere they gather views about issues\nfacing our non-UK students. They will\nalso work with the DPEW in liasing\nwith the International Office to ensure\nthat we are providing enough support\nand information for international students to ensure that their time at Imperial matches up to our international\nreputation.\u201d\nHer position was determined by a\ncampus wide vote, where only 112\nstudents voted, however, Miss Onda\nwon by a clear margin getting a total\nof 87 votes. Hopefully the turnout for\nthe Sabbatical positions, which are also\nCollege-wide, will yield a much higher\nnumber.\nMiss Saki Onda, the new\nInternational Students\u2019 Officer\nImperial College NHS\ncaught up in \u2018Lords for\nHire\u2019 scandal\nImperial college NHS Trust is currently at the centre of a fraud inquiry\ninvolving Americium Developments,\nan Edinburgh-based IT firm and CombineMed, a US health firm.\nScotland Yard is investigating allegations that Americium unfairly or\nfraudulently helped CombineMed win\na tender to supply information technology services to Imperial College\nNHS Trust. The deal was potentially\nworth tens of millions of pounds.\nThe Trust had initially hired Americium to organise the tender for a new\ninternet system. The firm was responsible for handling the bidding process.\nHowever, unbeknownst to the Trust,\nAmericium was at the same time being hired by one of the bidders, CombineMed, in order to promote the firm\nand help it win the contract.\nIt is alleged that to beat out the other\n36 bidders, Americium used its insider\nknowledge to assist CombineMed in\nwriting the tender specification. Staff\nwere also coached in how to answer any\ncrucial questions that the firm might\nget asked. What\u2019s more, an Americium\nemployee was sitting on the selection\npanel that eventually awarded the contract to CombineMed.\nAlso implicated in the fraud is Lord\nMoonie, who is paid to act as a consultant for Americium. Last month\nLord Moonie was named as one of four\npeers who were willing to amend a law\nin return for money in the \u2018Lords for\nHire\u2019 scandal. He is now being investigated for using his government links to\nhelp secure Americium\u2019s business with\nCombineMed. Three of his business\nassociates at Americium have been arrested and charged with conspiracy to\ncommit fraud.\nImperial college NHS Trust terminated its contract with Americium on\nhearing that the firm was receiving\nmonthly payments to promote CombineMed. The trust\u2019s counter fraud\nspecialist contacted the Metropolitan\nPolice fraud squad as soon as allegations came to light. The NHS Trust has\nnow also cancelled its contract with\nCombineMed and severed its links\nwith Americium. It has said it is unable\nto comment on the situation due to the\nongoing criminal investigations.\nLord Moonie, who is at the centre of the ongoing investigation over the \u2018Lords for Hire\u2019 scandal\nA tribute to Sir Henry Tizard,\nbecause we messed up\nSir Henry Tizard, rector from 1929 to\n1942 was arguably one of the most influential of all past rectors. His great\nvision saw Imperial College as a much\nlarger and prominent institution of\nhigher education in Great Britain and\neventually, the world. To do this, the\ncampus had to expand to accommodate the influx of outstanding academics and stellar students. As a result, he\nput the wheels in place to purchase the\nRoyal School of Needlework, a large\nbuilding on Exhibition Road. Being in\ntouch with students\u2019 needs and understanding their wants, Tizard purchased\nthe land at Harlington, still used today as Imperial\u2019s main sports ground.\nMuch of the campus as we know today\nexists because of Sir Henry Tizard\u2019s\ndedication to the college, its students\nand its staff.\nA chemist and a mathematician by\ntraining, Tizard was a prominent figure in the country\u2019s scientific community and was one of the pioneers of the\nradar preceding WWII.\nDuring the war, the rector was\nknown for spending many nights at\nthe college, fraternizing with both staff\nAfonso Campos\nNews Correspondent\nand students alike in an entirely informal and friendly fashion. In 1963, one\nof the main halls of residence in Southside was named after him, officially\nacknowledging his commitment to the\ninstitution.\nSir Henry Tizard, 4th Rector of\nImperial College\nUnion support\n\u201caxe the beer tax\u201d\ncampaign\nThe Editor\u2019s favourite beer could now be cheaper, but sadly not better.\nImperial College Union [ICU] Council passed a motion this Monday that\nwould see ICU support the Campaign\nfor Real Ale [CAMRA] and the British\nBeer and Pub Association campaign\nnamed \u2018Axe the beer tax \u2013 save the\npub\u2019.\nThe campaign has five key objec-tives, which included plans to stop the\nincrease in beer tax up to a third, to\nenforce existing laws \u2013 not create new\nones \u2013 to deal firmly with irresponsible drinkers and premises, to end the\nirresponsible promotion of alcohol in\nsupermarkets, pubs and elsewhere, to\ntrust responsible adults to make informed choices about what they drink,\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nnot punish them for the actions of an\nirresponsible minority and finally to\nsupport the British pub as a vital part\nof social life in local communities.\nOne of the arguments used by Tim\nBarrett (ICU Welfare Campaigns Officer) who was the proposer of the pa-per, argued that the increasing costs\nat public houses, directly related to\ntaxation, having a direct cost on the\nlong term welfare of students - both\nfinancially and damaging student welfare through losing affordable places to\nsocialize, thereby limiting the student\nexperience. The news will undoubtedly\nplease a vast majority of the student\npopulation at Imperial, as it will hopefully mean a slow down in the increasing cost of beer that has been seen in\nthe Union.\nphoto\ncourtesy\nof\nlive.cgcu.net\nThe hammer came down on ICUAFC last week, but some Union\nofficials felt that harsher punishments should have been handed out\nDina Ismail\nNews Correspondent\nImperial postgraduate\nstudent shortlisted for\nprestigious 2009 IET Award\nA postgraduate student from the Faculty of Electronic Engineering has been\nshortlisted for the prestigious 2009\nIET Young Woman Engineer of the\nYear Award. Hanna Sykulska, has just\nfinished her PhD, was part of NASA\u2019s\n2008 Pheonix mission that furthered\nthe exploration of Mars. the Institution of Engineering and Technology\n(IET) deemed her outstanding work\nwith NASA worthy of nomination.\nIET is a global professional society\nfor communities working in engineering and technology, which claims to\n\u2018promote the positive role of science\u2019\nwithin the world.\nThe award Sykulska is nominated for\nis awarded to an up-and-coming female\nwho has set herself up to be a \u2018dynamic\nand technically excellent professional\u2019.\nIf Sykulska is to win, she will become\nan IET role model for females in the\nengineering industry, and one that will\nbe able to inspire more women to enter\nthe male-majority industry.\nSykulska was scouted by NASA\nto become their Instrument Downlink Engineer (IDE) for the Phoenix\nmission at NASA mission control in\nArizona. She was one of three Imperial-based researchers to make up the\nPhoenix team. The mission involved\nsending a solar-panelled device to\ninvestigate previously unchartered\nNorthern plains of Mars, where upon\nterrain conditions and compositions\nwere analysed.\nSykulska was responsible for both\nthe design and feedback stages of the\nmission. She helped develop technology that was designed to hold Martian\nsoil samples, but also monitored the\ninformation the craft was sending back\nto the laboratory once it has landed.\nThough the mission has ended,\nSykulska will found out if her work\non Phoenix is enough to win the IET\naward on the 26th February.\nHowever, she has set her sights on\nfurther exploration, saying \u201cI certainly\nwant to send more instruments into\nspace and have the rare opportunity to\nlook at different planets.\u201d\nDan Wan\nNews Editor\nNASA\u2019s Phoenix imaging of Martian terrain that Sykulska worked on\n\n"

This was almost two seconds ahead of Paul Mattick of Wallingford RC who in 2007 took gold\nin the LM4- at the World rowing\nchampionships.\nIn third place, twelve seconds behind\nFreeman-Pask, was Olympic reserve\nRob Williams (London RC). Williams\nwas also the winner of the final cycling\ntime trial at a squad training camp in\nSydney this January, which FreemanPask did not attend.\nCoaches Steve Trapmore, Stuart\nWhitelaw and Cox Henry Fieldman\naccompanied the ICBC posse of LM1x\nentries Freeman-Pask & Andy Gordon, M1x entries Simon Hislop & Dan\nCadoux-Hudson and M2- entries Dom\nMeyrick-Cole & Henry Goodier.\nCompetitors were staying in the\nAnti-Comfort Inn at Boston and were\njust lulling to sleep when animal noises\n(later described by distressed witnesses as macaque mating calls) were heard\nacross the hall. The source of this nocturnal wailing was swifty identified as\nthe M2-\u2019s room.\nSporty and Ginger Spice\u2019s racing\ncombination are a nautical extension\nof the cottage love-pair starring just\none member of the original version.\nCome Saturday morning it was serious business and Led Zeppelin was\ndrafted in by Freeman-Pask and Viper\nFieldman for some final inspiration.\nTrapmore gave an in-depth pre-race\nchat on \u201cthe finer points of sculling\u201d\nwhich was quickly summarised by\nWhitelaw informing Freeman-Pask\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad sculler\u201d.\nThis seemed to do the trick and with\na pat on the back AFP was sent on his\nway to destroy the field.\nICBC had entries in all three men\u2019s\ncompetitive categories (LM1x, M1x &\nM2-) with good results overall. Joining\nFreeman-Pask in the lightweight single\nsculls was Andy Gordon who came\n14th in U23 (29th overall).\nIC student Oli Mahony competed for\nLondon RC and came 10th in the trial.\nIn the heavyweight single sculls race\nthere was tough competition with Alan\nCampbell of Tideway Sculler\u2019s taking a\nclear sixteen second victory ahead of\nIan Lawson (Leander) in second and\nAndy Triggs-Hodge (Molesey BC) in\nthird.ICBC\u2019s Simon Hislop and Dan\nCadoux-Hudson finished 13th and\n20th (6th in U23) respectively.\nIn the pair\u2019s race Goodier and Meyrick-Cole came 18th overall (9th in\nU23/5th in U20). At the half-way point\nRun DMC had exhausted all leg reserves and had an unscheduled switch\nto guns. Unfortunately these were depleted even faster and after a failed attempt of switching to lats there were\nonly a few strokes left in the race.\nBack at ICBC basecamp FreemanPask\u2019s 101.2% gold rank win has been\nan inspiration to the entire boat club.\nThe gym\u2019s FitVibe machine has been\nvibrating non-stop since the news with\ncrews trying to replicate the success.\nRecent reports claim ITB foam rollers (or AFP foam rollers) are sold out\nacross London. Pre-early morning sessions have seen squads releasing all\ntight fascia tissue and decreasing tension on the iliotibial band in a gracious\ntribute to their hero.\nBut before we all get carried away\nwith Pask-mania let the truth be known\nthat Bill \u201cRigmeister\u201d Mason (of ICBC\nClub Room fame) laid his magic hands\non the winning boat a week prior to\nracing.\nMason was modest in his contribution to the result when speaking\nto Freeman-Pask later; \u201cYou owe me\none\u201d.Freeman-Pask has been developing momentum this season, posting\ntwo consecutive personal bests on his\n2km ergo scores [6:14.7 at a weight of\n72kg].\nThis is testament to the hard work\nthat he has put in over the winter and\na big public statement for the development of rowing at Imperial College.\nmatches before taking the field again\nthemselves. It was becoming clear that\nNottingham would be the team to beat\nthis afternoon with Bedford closely\nfollowing. Abertay rarely threatened\nand Rennes seemed to be there mainly for the steam. Commendations to\nthem though for fielding, the presence of a French team (in this their\n2nd year competing), alongside IC in\nour first year with further rumours of\nLSE and UWE joining next year seem\nto be pointing to a second renaissance\nin GAA and perhaps a ULU League in\nthe near future. All part of Michael Cusack\u2019s vision no doubt\u2026\nOur complacency regarding Rennes\nwas soon to be shaken off in our second match, when the French visitors\nagainst all expectations snatched a\ngoal in the first minute. Frank O\u2019Neill\u2019s\ninimitable match analysis pointed towards a distinct player who would need\nto be marked out of the game - enter\nPat McMullen. With McMullen keeping the Rennes playmaker out of the\ngame, IC opened their account with a\npoint from Lavery on the left wing. IC\nadded a few more scores with Conor\nTaylor prolific himself and once again\ncombining well with the full forward\nO\u2019Neill. Despite holding the ascendancy IC were not allowed to settle in\nthe second half and Rennes with some\ngood fielding and fitness managed\nanother goal and would\u2019ve had more\nwere it not for some fine shot stopping\nby Chris Farrell. Full time score 2-07 to\n2-00.\nThe third group match was against rivals Bedford. The humbling defeat endured at Fortress Harlington was fresh\nin many minds and IC took to the field\nto demonstrate some Darwinism and\npain. This was to be our finest match\nof the tournament; the team held its\nshape perfectly and there were flashes\nof inter county standard football particularly by Haugh, O\u2019Shea, McCann\nand again Taylor. Supreme fielding saw\nIC win every midfield battle, supplying\nan untiring forward five who added\nscore after score. On the few occasions\nwhen Bedford did manage to break\ninto the IC defence there were stopped\nin their tracks by O\u2019Hare and Stranney;\nMcMullen and Lavery allowing nothing through to trouble the keeper. Our\nbest and most satisfying match of the\nweekend 4-07 to 0-03. Justice.\nWith daylight waning our final match\nwas against a respectable Nottingham\nteam who were eager to beat us to topping the group. With qualification already guaranteed at Bedford\u2019s expense\nIC took their foot off the pedal and\nrested Jimmy Haugh in nets. Nottingham took first blood and went in at the\nhalf time break with a two point lead.\nThe second half saw IC regain the\nimpetus and decide they wanted to go\nunbeaten on Saturday. Four well taken\npoints without reply took us into the\nlead which was held on to in a fast\npaced and physical closing ten min-utes, including a spectacular double\nsave by Haugh in nets when Nottingham had broken through.\nSunday came and we were on the\nroad again. New York, as another guest\nentry, had actually managed to top the\nother group so they would be playing\nNottingham whilst we were due to play\nSheffield Hallam. IC sadly denied the\nopportunity to Run New York then.\nThe return of Donnacha Kirk and Noel\nRyan to our ranks visibly lifted the\nteam and with a newly strengthened\ndefence, McMullen was moved into\nhalf forward and Haugh remained in\nnets. Immediately Sheffield were keen\nto play a physical game, with some audacious fouls which should\u2019ve seen the\nreferee reach for his cards on at least\nfive occasions, O\u2019Hare bearing the\nbrunt of this ill tempered exchange \u2013\nclearly one of Sheffield\u2019s main threats.\nPlayed on a soft pitch with legs already heavy from yesterday\u2019s four\nmatches IC were a wearied team. Our\nforwards who had dominated the day\nbefore were tested a lot more by the\nopposing defence and chances that\nshould have been converted were\nmissed, whilst defending was at times\nslack, allowing Sheffield\u2019s pacey corner\nforwards the opportunity to score.\nAt half time we were down but not\nout, one point being the difference in a\nlow scoring half. We drew level straight\nafter the restart but in the next ten\nminutes Sheffield piled on the pres-sure, helped by a large amount of cynical fouling and the referee giving them\nthe benefit of doubt, they ran out into\na strong lead. IC never gave up though\nand did snatch a goal in the closing\nminutes. Too little too late though, as\nSheffield had done enough earlier. It\nwas a disappointed IC team that left\nthe field but with a respectable score\nline of 1-05 to 2-07 against a strong\nSheffield team who did go on to win\nthe tournament.\nIC have a lot of positives to take\nfrom the weekend, and eagerly await\nthe same Championships next year. A\ngreat weekend of football was had with\na strong team ethic and some fantastic\nindividual performances. Man of the\ntournament went to Edward O\u2019Hare\nwho commanded the half back line\nlike it were his own and was responsible for keeping IC\u2019s conceded scores\nto the minimum of all teams in the\ntournament.\nIC Gaelic Football has come through\nit\u2019s maiden season with flying colours;\nrespectable League performances,\nclub members McCann and Gallagher\nbeing called up to the national side\nand reaching the semi-finals in the\nUK Championships point to a bright\nfuture for the club. Gaelic Football is\nhere to stay.\nICUGFC in Birmingham\nContinuing from back page\nLast year\u2019s ACC sportsman of the year, Adam Freeman-Pask yet again makes a strong case to be considered again for the 2009 award\n\n"

Richard Lai shares his view on how to use this powerful tool.\nT\nomo Roberts had just\nwalked into the felix of-fice, rambling on about\nhow people had been trying to get him to join Twitter, but he struggled to understand why\nthey are obsessed with \u201ctelling people\nI\u2019m going to the toilet\u201d. If you are thinking the same then you are probably\nwondering: what exactly is Twitter?\nAnd how has the 140-character limit\nturned the site into a $200m business?\nTwitter has been publicly available\nsince August 2006, but it was only recently that the majority of Britain started to hear about this powerful online\ntool, thanks to the participation of local\ncelebrities. First-time users may find\nthat Twitter alone is merely a website\nwith a text box, similar to Facebook\u2019s\n\u201cstatus update\u201d feature which is technically a micro-blogging tool, but unlike\nFacebook your networking is not restricted by which group you\nare in - there are no groups,\nand you can \u201cfollow\u201d any\nTwitter users so that their\n\u201cupdates\u201d (or \u201ctweets\u201d) appear\non your Twitter homepage. You\ncan also reply to\nother users\nby including\n\u201c@\u201d in front of\ntheir usernames in\nyour updates (hence\nthe article\u2019s title).\nThe Freedom of Twitter\nLike most social networking tools and\nsearch engine optimization (SEO)\nproducts these days, Twitter was\nlaunched in San Francisco. Co-founder\nand active CEO, Evan Williams (@ev),\nwas quoted saying that unlike many\narticles that provide a list of Twitter\nrules, there are actually no rules on\nhow you should use the simple tool - in\nfact, most of the quoted terminologies\nused above were mostly likely to have\ncome from the users \u201cwithout any input from the company\u201d. Furthermore,\nlike YouTube, users have discovered all\nsorts of ways to harness the connection power for learning, sharing, mar-keting, or just for fun. (See the \u201cWhat\npeople use Twitter for\u201d box)\nIt is this freedom and creativity that\nled to the birth of many Twitter clients\nfor different platforms. For desktops\n(Windows, Mac and Linux), the star\nof the show is the London-designed\nTweetDeck, which not only automatically retrieves updates at set intervals,\nbut also has a search feature which can\nbe a nice alternative to Google for certain criteria. I will explain this later.\nSee Your Nearby Tweets\nSmartphones are also responsible for\nthe boost in number of Twitter users:\nthe iPhone alone has at least four dedicated Twitter apps, and users of Windows Mobile and Blackberry also have\na few options. The advantage of using\nTwitter on these devices is that most of\nthe apps are location-aware, meaning\nyou can read tweets sent from nearby\ndevices.\nFor me, this location-aware feature\nwas ever so useful when I was covering\nthe CES in Las Vegas: using \u201cTwinkle\u201d\non my iPhone, I was able to ask fellow\nbloggers for up-to-date information\nregarding the show, as well as reading CES-related tweets in a style simi-People use Twitter for...\nimperialcollege: Imperial uses Twitter to highlight College news and\nannouncements, campus activities\nand community events\njackpea: news feed, a good laugh,\ncelebrity haven (lately anyway), all\nround pretty addictive!\ndeancarl: I use it because I find the\nFacebook update feature to be too\n\u2018closed\u2019.

In fact, I went\nas far as getting the attention of US\ntech show presenter, Patrick Norton\n(@patricknorton; currently hosting\nSystm and Tekzilla; you can subscribe\nthe video podcasts on iTunes).\nCelebrity Haven\nSince the CES, I had tweeted directly\nwith Patrick Norton again a couple of\ntimes. This is perhaps the main reason that people join Twitter: you get a\nchance to speak to celebrities directly.\nIn Britain, we have nice celebrities like\nStephen Fry (@stephenfry) who do\nrespond to questions and greetings in\nTwitter, thus naturally gaining a huge\nnumber of follow-ers: 207,434 as\nof Wednesday\n8:50pm\n(ranked\nthird\nmost follow-ers, with @cn-nbrk second and @\nBarackObama first),\nand going up literally\nby the minute! So if you\ndo get a reply from Mr. Fry\nthen you are extremely lucky!\nYou will also find other active and\ninteresting British celebrities to follow\n(they should all be genuine):\n@bobbyllew\n\u2022 (Robert Llewellyn)\n\u2013 Red Dwarf actor\n@WilliamShatner\n\u2022 \u2013 ex-Star Trek\nactor\n@MayorOfLondon\n\u2022 \u2013 funny man,\nBoris Johnson\n@CHRISDJMOYLES\n\u2022 \u2013 BBC\nRadio 1 DJ\n@Fearnecotton\n\u2022 \u2013 BBC Radio 1\nDJ\n@Wossy\n\u2022 (Jonathan Ross) \u2013 BBC\npresenter\n@jupitusphillip\n\u2022 (Phil Jupitus) \u2013\nBritishcomedianandteamcaptain\nof Never Mind the Buzzcocks\n@JohnCleese\n\u2022 \u2013memberofMonty\nPython and Fawlty Towers actor\n@GarethM\n\u2022 (Gareth Mitchell)\n\u2013 presenter of BBC Digital\nPlanet, also a lecturer in Science\nCommunication at Imperial\nThis list should get you going \u2013 by\nchecking out their \u201cfollowing\u201d lists you\nshould easily find other people that\nyou might want to follow.\nPractical Use\nOf course, Twitter isn\u2019t just about\nstalking celebrities. Earlier this week\nI had a new follower: Pamela Agar\n(@PamelaAgar), Head of Digital\nMedia & Marketing at Imperial, who\nis part of the team behind Imperial\u2019s\nTwitter account, @imperialcollege.\nMs. Agar said the idea of setting up\n@imperialcollege came quite recently:\nif you were affected by the heavy snow\nfall a few weeks back, you might have\nnoticed the Twitter logo on Imperial\u2019s\nweather alert page - that was when Ms.\nAgar\u2019s team first signed up for Twitter, as \u201ca helpful extra way to get news\nquickly around the College community\nabout what was open or closed at the\nCollege\u201d.\nWhen I asked what Imperial aims\nrichardlai: For me it\u2019s instant mes-saging, news feed, travelling, celeb-rity-stalking, market research, video/\nlink-sharing and blogging.\ntadekk: I use Twitter mainly for fa-cebook-status style microblogging\nbut really hope it will catch on in UK,\nas it did in US\nTwitter apps for the iPhone: TwitterFon and Twinkle\nto achieve by using Twitter, Ms. Agar\nexpressed that they would like to keep\nthe immediate College community, the\nextended College family (alumni, sup-porters, prospective students etc.) and\nanyone who is interested informed,\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be aiming to do fun takes on\nwhat\u2019s going on at Imperial \u2013 campus\nnews and promotions, announce-ments, events and any other interesting or startling snippets about College\nwe come across.\u201d\nOn the student activities front, @im-perialcollege has already tweeted about\nArtsFest, RAG week, the Great Egg\nRace, Varsity Match, Union elections\nand careers talks recently, so if you\nwere an organiser of any of the above,\ndo send them a tweet to thank them,\nor better yet, send them a feedback or\nideas via twitter@imperial.ac.uk.\nWe are not alone though - a lot of\nuniversities are already actively using\nTwitter. Ms. Agar listed @UniofBath,\n@warwickuni and @TuftsUniversity\nas their favourite ones, so do mention\nthem to your friends who attend those\nuniversities.\nSmarter than just \u201cGoogling\u201d\nAs demonstrated by @imperialcollege,\nTwitter is able to provide the most up-to-date information within 140 char-acters, so by using the built-in search\nengines in supported apps, you should\neasily find relevant results to suit your\ntime-critical needs.\nHere\u2019s a good example: yesterday\nI was looking for an Easter flight for\nHong Kong, and while searching for\nairlines through the old Google way,\nI also tweeted the found ticket prices\nvia TweetDeck, just to see if anyone\nhad seen cheaper ones. Soon, a fellow\nTwitter user @sfahmy (who turned\nout to be an Imperial College graduate:\nMEng ISE \u201999-\u201903, then PhD EEE \u201903\u201907; he followed me in the first place)\nrecommended a few websites for comparing the quality of different airlines,\nand he also kindly provided some tips\non collecting airmiles.\nI then came across what seemed to\nbe a cheap airline called \u201cJet Airways\u201d.\nFrom Google the results were heavy\non negative comments, which were\nnot very helpful. I then switched to\nTweetDeck to search for \u201cJet Airways\u201d,\nand immediately I had a list of relevant\ncomments that were of similar lengths,\nmaking the comparison fairer. At the\nsame time, a few Twitter users also\nresponded to my earlier tweet regarding the said Indian airline: the general\nconsensus was that Jet Airways is quite\ngood, but sadly I later found out that\nthe flight cost I saw did not include tax!\nNevertheless, the point is that Twitter\ncan efficiently deliver smart results,\nthus making your life easier.\nWhere\u2019s the Money?\nWhile it is true that the ultimate driving force behind Twitter is money, I say\nwhy not enjoy it while it is still ad-free?\nThere have been speculations that\nTwitter will eventually start charging\ncommercial users (marketers, retailers,\netc.), but Twitter, Inc. is still keeping\ntheir mouth shut tight about their revenue model. This should not disrupt\nthe average users like us anyway, so until then, why not join the party and see\nfor yourself how Twitter can be such a\nuseful tool? Happy tweeting, Tomo!\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTravel\nTravel Editor \u2013 Dylan Lowe\nDylan Lowe\nTravel Editor\nTourist Vs.\nTraveller\nDylan Lowe ponders what should be done when you find \u2013\nand catch \u2013 a Madrile\u00f1o pickpocket\nI\nam not going to patronise you\nwith the boring bits of Madrid:\nwhile writing pompous, repetitive accounts of Plaza Mayor\nor the Prado isn\u2019t what I take\npleasure in, making you endure reading them isn\u2019t either. So forget the bullfights (they don\u2019t operate during winters anyway) and sangrias, let us delve\ninto this one thing the Spanish capital\nis famed for: theft.\nIt appeared to be a bleak February\nafternoon when my plane landed on\nSpanish soil. The first SMS I received\nwas a distressing one: my German\nfriend, who had invited me to spend a\nfew days touring the city in his compa-ny, suggested that I take extra caution\nover my belongings. What followed\nwas the simple, but effective, state-ment: my dad nearly got robbed.\nStanding alone and helpless within\nBarajas airport, I could think of at least\n50 ways to lose my wallet and enact\neach in my paranoia-corrupt imagina-tion. Until the customs officer called\nme over and gave me looks for my hideous passport photograph.\nSettling down at Cervecer\u00eda Alemana (6 Plaza de Santa Ana), well-known\nas an Ernest Hemingway hangout, my\ncompanion gave a full account of the\nordeal: his father was boarding a train\nearlier amidst a rush-hour crowd when\na pickpocket, seizing the opportunity,\nsnatched his wallet. Then, so clumsily,\nhe dropped it. His accomplice, covering the tracks, proceeded to return it\nto its owner. However professional the\nacting had been performed, there were\nlittle doubt that foul play was involved.\nAnd I na\u00efvely came to believe that\na tale is as close as I could get to the\nworld of Madrile\u00f1o treachery.\nYou little thieving\npiece of...\nI\nn a rush to prove my worth and\n(fail to) make my felix debut\nshine, I forgot to introduce my-self. My name is Dylan, first year\ngeologist and avid traveller. Fingers crossed, I will live up to the standards set by my predecessors; for that\nreason I pledge only to deliver articles\nbased on my own encounters and those\nof whom I know, rather than those\nfreshly harvested from Wikipedia.\nMind you, I said \u2018traveller\u2019. Not to be\nconfused with \u2018tourist\u2019, which is not a\nsynonym of traveller \u2013 call me a tourist and I will hunt you down in retri-bution. There should be no confusion\nin distinguishing between the elegant\ntraveller and the inconsiderate, pretentious industry that is tourism.\nOr is there?\nI have always branded myself as a\ntraveller, but only for vanity\u2019s sake. I\nhave heard disgruntled moans of fellow \u2018travellers\u2019 over the mistreatment\nthey received from locals who \u2018mistook\nthem for tourists\u2019. Not until now, how-ever, have I actually mused on this subject with a philosophical depth worthy\nfor such a controversy.\nSo where should we start?\nOh yes. I hate tourists. And I hate\nbeing one. The way hordes of them\npour out of air-conditioned coaches,\nthe crackle as the suitcases hit the tarmac and the squeal of their wheels.\nThey banter in their native tongue and\nwhine about everything \u2018foreign\u2019, trample the streets with ignorance and disregard for the locals, and wreak havoc\nin hotel lobbies with their appalling\ntake on fashion (and brightly coloured\nGola shoes, in Afonso\u2019s archetype of\nan Iberian tourist). Pass nightfall and\nyet another meal of Spag Bol later they\nfind comfort in their beds, but not before screeching at each other across the\ncorridors with booze-fuelled rigour.\nMind changed: I don\u2019t hate tourists. I\nloathe them, and I despise them.\nAnd aren\u2019t we \u2018travellers\u2019 so differ-ent? We would come swaggering into\nthe scene, dashing and graceful, appropriately dressed and full of enthusiasm,\nand get cozy in a local caf\u00e9. Ringing up\nthe hostel we make an enquiry over\nour reservation using the local dialect.\nFeasting on local delicacies, we exchange colourful travel stories before\ndescending into the fray that is a local\nfestival. We treat these words by Paul\nTheroux, the legendary travel writer,\nwith biblical authority: \u201ctourists don\u2019t\nknow where they\u2019ve been, travellers\ndon\u2019t know where they\u2019re going.\u201d\nCall me stereotypical and elitist.\nGranted, like all existing stereotypes,\nmy definitions of the tourist/travel-ler won\u2019t work. A tourist is as likely\nto lodge in a hostel as a traveller in a\nhotel. A traveller may be the fashion\nnightmare while the tourist is well suited in a tux. The person in the local caf\u00e9\ncan be the tourist, and he who peers\nthrough the windows of Starbucks a\ntraveller (I plead guilty).\nThe distinction between the tourist\nand traveller should not be driven by\nmaterialistic measures.\nIt is in this phenomenon to dissociate oneself from the notoriety of tourists and, more ambitiously, tourism on\nthe whole, that the class of anti-tourists\nis born. My paragraph-long rant is a\nprime example of anti-tourism: bitter,\nelitist, easily mistaken as the works of a\nxenophobe. We are the exact opposite\nof the tourist, as the ideology suggests,\nand we are better.\nBut is the \u2018opponent of all principles\ntouristic\u2019 a suitable definition for the\ntraveller? I don\u2019t think so.\nIn fact, anti-tourists have a lot in\ncommon with their arch enemies. As F\nDaniel Harbecke, contributor to Brave\nNew Traveler (www.bravenewtravel.\ncom), pointed out: \u201ctravel becomes\ntourism when focus shifts from the\nexperience itself to the vehicle of\nexperience.\u201d\nThe attackers of tourism have become tourists themselves.\nTo truly become a traveller one must\nalter one\u2019s attitude to \u2013 and expectations from \u2013 travelling. Which means\ncasting off your homely delights,\nputting yourself in the shit, then come\nout having had not only an adventure\nof a lifetime, but a spiritual discovery\nof oneself. Explorers are not explorers\nunless they brave the uncharted waters,\nand neither are travellers travellers if\nthey cower before unfamiliarity. The\noff-beaten tracks are where the magic\nof travelling happens, not the pretty\nphotographs inside your Rough Guide.\nThe world of travelling is reserved for\nthe dauntless. And those who are not\nafraid to unleash their full potential.\nI leave you with this challenge.\n*\nGot any travel trivia to share? I would\nlove to hear it. Send it to travel.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk and one will be selected\neach week to be published.\nIn came Sunday and it was El Rastro\nday. Madrid\u2019s very own flea market, El\nRastro is every bargain hunter\u2019s fan-tasy. More like the \u2018Royal Academy\nof Thievery\u2019, for those preying on the\nvisitors in the midst of the weekend\nfrenzy. My friend, still traumatised by\nthe incident in the metro, begged to\nproceed no further.\nI relented; thus began an aimless\nwander around the city. Hours later,\nthe glorious Calle Gran V\u00eda soon came\ninto view.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before we made it into\nH&M.\nA short stroll into the store later and\nI felt the twitch around my thigh. Ultra-sensitive as I am, I readjusted the\nstrap and my bag swung into view. The\nfront pouch was unzipped. As my hand\ndived through the opening it sensed\nthat something that didn\u2019t belong there.\nAnother hand. The fraction of a second that followed it swiftly retracted,\nits owner fully materialised as a Spaniard lurking behind my back, face dead\nguilty over his fraudulent deed.\nI wouldn\u2019t have lost anything more\nTo commit an act of utter bollocks\n3...2...1...\nThe Royal Academy itself, El Rastro\nthan a packet of tissues, since I wasn\u2019t\nfoolish enough to leave valuables somewhere as accessible as the front pocket.\nYet I didn\u2019t exactly do myself any favours by holding a Lonely Planet and\nmap in each hand, camera hung loose\naround neck like the clich\u00e9d Japanese\ntourist. I looked like every pickpocket\u2019s\nideal target.\nWhat could I have done to the thief?\nI had the liberty to pin him down, declare him a hijo de puta for stealing,\nthen hand the man to the police for his\ncrimes.\nThe police would have discharged\nhim due to lack of evidence. Only if\nthey bother detaining him in the first\nplace. Forget the police. Just a good\nbattering as punishment.\nBut who am I to judge? Whether the\nman was driven to illegality by desperation or not, I would never know.\nIt would take someone with some\nmessed-up ethics to deliver a Judge\nDread sentence. Besides, I was more\nlikely to be persecuted for an act of\nviolence than the pickpocket for an act\nof theft.\nI could do nothing. So I did nothing.\nI am not saying \u2018for God\u2019s sake,\navoid Madrid\u2019. In fact, why should you\nbe deterred from visiting the city, or\nanywhere else on Earth, by the risk\nof theft and loss? You shouldn\u2019t. Not\nbecause these incidents are relatively\nuncommon, but because you can prevent them with the right precautions.\nOnce you have found \u2013 or caught \u2013 a\npickpocket, you would have gained the\nexperience to deal with a similar situation in the future.\nAnd I will never wear a camera\naround my neck ever again.\nDon\u2019t just go there for Hemingway\u2019s ghost - the tapas and beers are\nheavenly too\nJumping off a bridge with a latex rope\nstrapped to your legs?

If you\u2019re\nstuck in on a Sunday doing a lab report,\nthere is no better feeling than having a\nbig pot of slow-cooked stew on the hob\nwaiting for you to gobble down with a\nhunk of old bread.\nTo get a good bargain on meat, pop\ndown to your local butcher to get a really cheapo cut of beef or lamb. If you\nare lucky enough to live in or near Battersea, you had better get acquainted\nwith Luis and Ricardo\u2019s Family Butchers on Battersea Bridge Road. Far from\nthe extortionate steak and chicken you\ncan buy on the supermarket shelves,\nthis butcher offers unusual and tasty\ncuts of meat at wholesale prices. And if\nyou get to know him well he\u2019ll pop in a\ncouple of free onions into the bargain.\nLegend.\nOnce you have your meat, the simplest slow-cook can be done by just\nadding your meat to a couple of car-rots, onions, tins of plum tomatoes and\nherbs, then cooking for a few hours on\na low heat with plenty of seasoning. To\nsave on the old gas bills, it might make\nsense to invest a couple of quid in a\nmini-slow cooker which makes enough\nstew for two.\nTo continue with the \u2018slow\u2019 theme\nour Keeper of the Stove, David Wallis,\nconjures up a delicious slow-cooked\npork belly. Belly of pork is another of\nthose cheap cuts making a comeback.\nWe\u2019ve had our economic growth with\na side of rack of lamb and fillet steak.\nThe recession, sir, comes with a portion of pork belly, shin of beef and a bit\nof imagination.\nAnother way to ward off the budget\nblues is to happify your belly with a\ngood-value meal out.

It was a most welcome\nsurprise upon sitting down that Carlos, the restaurant\u2019s co-owner insisted\nwe sample the margarita menu. After\nan oh-so reluctant acceptance we were\nthen presented with a pomegranate\nmargarita and the house speciality \u2013\nthe Margarita Santo. A delicate balance of sour lemon and lime juices and\na sweet pineapple flavour, all capped\noff with a rim of chilli on the glass.\nCocktails are deceptively difficult to\nperfect and the barman at Santo truly\nhas mastered the margarita. With the\nbar open until 1am at weekends, can\nyou think of a better way to escape the\nEnglish February than supping cocktails late into the night?\nThe staples of the standard Mexican\nrestaurant are present at Santo: burri-tos, quesadillas, enchiladas etc. But\nthe diverse range of fillings, from the\nconservative chilli con carne to orange\njuice marinated pork, slow-cooked in\nbanana leaves and served with pickled\nred onions.

Unfortunately, the brilliant\nVapiano review was not written by my\nhand but by the lovely Natalia JardonKing. Please correct your copies from\nlast week with a large, red, felt-tip\npen.\nEarlier today I was imbibing my\ndaily fix of radio-broadcasted female\nempowerment (a.k.a Woman\u2019s Hour).\nIn between the bitter divorcees and\nreproductively-challenged couples was\nan absorbing piece about sandwiches.\nThey had sent out a young and enthusiastic researcher to collar Mancunian\nworkers on their midday breaks and to\nreveal their darkest luncheon secrets.\nUnsurprisingly, most people (includ-ing you) can spend up to \u00a3100 a month\non lunches alone. This adds up to\nabout \u00a3600 being spent on bread, butter and mayonnaise for the average undergraduate in an academic year and if\nyou think about opportunity costs, you\ncould make double that amount of food\nif it were homemade, or just not be in\nas much debt at the end of the year.\nUnfortunately, I am a Libra and I\nam aware of another side of this ar-gument: what about The Sandwich\nShop? If we all made ourselves lunch\neveryday, amazing local eateries like\nthis one would certainly go out of busi-ness. What would we do without our\nlukewarm samosas and foot-long baguettes wrapped in 5 layers of Clingfilm? I think most of the student/staff\npopulation of Imperial would go to\nruins without The Sandwich Shop. As\nusual we must make a compromise:\nsave yourself some money for one half\nof the week and make yourself a big,\nTupperware lunch or club sandwich.\nFor the rest of the week, indulge in a\nSandwich Shop outing or a lardy Panini from the JCR.\nIf this sounds like far too much ef-fort, it might be easier to just make a\nlittle bit more of the dinner you had\nlast night. Cold pizza, pasta bake and\nServes 2-3\n500-600g Belly Pork (make sure there is a good layer of fat under the skin)\n1 small or half a large onion sliced\n2-3 Cox\u2019s apples, peeled, cored and sliced into 8 half-moon shaped segments\n2 teaspoons fennel seeds (optional)\n1 tablespoon of fresh sage, chopped (if you haven\u2019t got sage, thyme will also work well)\nOlive oil\n2-3 mashing potatoes, peeled and chopped and left to soak (this stops them being too starchy)\nGood handful Kale chopped\n1 portion of Laughing Cow cheese\nMilk\nButter\n100ml good-quality dry English cider\n2 tablespoons double cream\n1 teaspoon grainy mustard\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\nPre-heat the oven to 220o\nC. Score the skin of the pork with as sharp a knife as you can find, taking care not\nto cut down into the meat. Pour over some boiling water, drain and dry well with kitchen towel (this process\ncauses the skin to contract and gives you better crackling). Once dry, rub the skin lightly with olive oil before\nsprinkling with a good pinch of salt and a teaspoon of fennel seeds. Work the salt and fennel seeds into the\ncuts you have made in the skin. Put the onion, apples, sage and a teaspoon of fennel seeds in a deep roasting\ntin and large enough to accommodate the meat. Add a dash of olive oil and give a good mix together.\nArrange the apple and onions into a bed that the pork can rest on, trying to keep all of the mixture directly underneath the meat. This may take a bit of fiddling but once you are happy, gently place the pork in the centre of\nthe hot oven and roast for 25 minutes. After the 25 minutes are up, turn the heat right down to 160o\nC and leave\nto cook for 1.5 \u2013 2 hours. Half-an-hour or so before the pork is done cooking you need to prepare the mash\npotatoes. Simply drain the chopped potatoes and boil in fresh water for 15 -20 minutes or until soft. Once the\npork\u2019s time is up, check it to see if the skin has transformed to the state of crackling-crispiness you desire. If\nit still seems a bit soft, just bung it back in the oven on maximum heat and check it every couple of minutes\nuntil the job is done (don\u2019t worry too much about burning the meat, belly is very forgiving). When happy with\nyour pork, remove from the oven and leave to rest. Drain the potatoes thoroughly, ensuring that there is no\nwater left in the pan. Return the cooked potatoes to the pan with a good knob of butter, a splash of milk, the\nLaughing Cow cheese, a pinch of salt and a few turns of freshly-ground black pepper. Mash the potato until\nsmooth, check seasoning and set aside \u2013 keeping warm. Cook the Kale for 5 minutes in boiling water. In the\nmean time, heat a small frying pan on high. When hot, pour in the cider and boil vigorously for two or three\nminutes before adding the mustard and cream. Stir together, add a bit of salt and freshly-ground pepper and\nset aside. Finally, cut the belly pork into thick strips and plate up with the mash and cooked kale. Put a spoonful\nor two of the apple and onion mix alongside the meat and pour the cider and cream dressing over the veg.\nBreathe a sigh of relief and eat with gusto whilst sipping the rest of your cider.\nWritten and Created by David Wallis\nSlow-Roast Crispy\nPork Belly\nSlow Cooking: Worth its Wait in Gold\nAs with a particular brand of Irish stout, the old adage, \u201cGood\nthings come to those who wait\u201d, is never more true than when it\ncomes to home cooking and fat, considered the scourge of food\nof the fast variety, is positively essential when it comes to taking\na more scenic route to the dining table. Fat means flavour, and,\nwhen left to gently bubble along over the course of a few hours,\nwill slowly melt away and release untold richness of flavour leaving you with meat so tender and juicy that you may well find yourself slumping to your knees, sobbing in unbridled ecstasy. The\nrecipe here, whilst requiring a bit of forethought and effort in the\nkitchen, is more than worth it for the pay-off. When you cook pork\nbelly like this, for example, the resulting sensation that comes\nwith the salty, piggy crunch of crisp golden crackling, coupled\nwith the rich gooey melt of velvety flesh, is probably the closest\nyou can get to the meaning of life. So, like Sting in the bedroom,\nslow is definitely the way to go.\nWant it... want it now.

Everything went\naccording to plan before the game with\nthe Welsh being confused by the inconceivable shortage of sheep on the\nroad, which meant that one of their\nminibuses, got lost. They made it to\nFortress Harlington in the end and\ndidn\u2019t know what hit them when the\nfirst whistle sounded.\nEven the referee immediately recognised that there would only be one\nteam dominating this pitch today. So\nwhile refereeing and, even more so,\ncommenting the game he decided that\nthere was no point to give any favours\nto the visitors. The game was all in IC\u2019s\nhands and after a few kicks from their\nsheepish 10 which were promptly returned by the Imperial backs, the hosts\nstarted to play some fabulous rugby\nwhich pinned Cardiff in their own 22.\nA few chances to score were blown\nbut then the outstanding fly-half Joe\nBrown decided to take matters into\nhis own hands by seeing off the guests\u2019\npathetic excuse for a back-line before\nscoring in the right corner. Alex Johnstone missed the conversion. In de-fence, Imperial was sound and could\nwork well around the rucks whilst the\nbacks made some great runs off turnover balls. One of them could only be\nstopped deep in the Cardiff half. Some\nquick hands towards the left touchline\nsaw fresher Jack Newton touch down\nfor a try in the corner. 10-0 wasn\u2019t good\nenough for the hosts, though, who decided that a larger result would reflect\nthe first half a lot better which meant\nthat Flannan O\u2019Mahoney, actually a\nwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, stole yet another Cardiff lineout after a kick deep\ninto their half from the Imperial back-three. A few phases later, prop Joe\nSaunders found himself in the middle\nof the IC back-line so once he realised\nthat running sideways is not what you\ndo in rugby, he gave the ball to fullback\nMax Joachim who, still influenced by\nthe 2009 Super Bowl, dummied a quarterback pass to the wing only to find\nhimself a clear line towards the Cardiff\ntry line. This time, Johnstone wanted\nto put his name on the score sheet, too,\nto make it 17-0 at half-time.\nThe second half started slowly but\nsome aggressive defensive work by Imperial\u2019s back row and centres produced\na fair number of turnover balls which\nwere eventually put into points when\nscrum-half Freddie Chalke finished\nRugby\nImperial College 1st XV 38\nCardiff University 1st XV 7\nLast weekend ICUGFC competed in\nour first British Universities Gaelic\nFootball Championship.

    "content": "16 felix Friday 20 February 2009\nScience\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA new device has been developed\nby Imperial College, London and its\nspinout company DNA Electronics\nthat is capable of testing patients to\nsee if they will react badly to certain\nprescribed medications, such as antidepressants and cholesterol controlling drugs.\nThe prototype device, known as\nSNP Dr (pronounced \u2018snip doctor\u2019)\nworks by analysing the DNA in saliva\nor cheek swab samples. The process is\nso quick that it can be carried out by a\nGP before they prescribe the patient\u2019s\nmedicine without the cost of laboratory analysis.\nThe device works by analysing genetic variations called Single Nucleotide\nPolymorphisms (SNPs) which are the\nparts of human DNA that control our\nindividual responses to disease, bacte-ria, viruses, toxins or medication.\nThe researchers are also focusing\non how the snip doctor device might\nbe able to detect genetic sequences\nwhich control the speed of our metab-olism, something else which can affect the body\u2019s reaction to a medicine.\nSlow metabolisms can make the drugs\nlast longer in the body and therefore\nincrease the risk of side effects, whilst\nsomeone with a fast metabolism is\nlikely to process the medication to\nquickly for it to have any adverse\neffects.\nThe NHS spends \u00a3460 million a\nyear treating patients suffering adverse reactions to prescribed medi-cations, with their symptoms ranging in severity from dizziness and\nnausea to even heart palpitations and\nunconsciousness.\nAlthough the device is still a prototype (about to begin clinical trials\nthanks to a newly formed partnership\nwith the pharmaceutical company\nPfizer), there is hope that not only will\nGPs be able to personalise a patient\u2019s\ntreatment but according to Dr Leila\nShepherd, Chief Technology Officer of\nDNA Electronics, the introduction of\nthe SNP DR might enable new drugs\nto become readily available in a cost\neffective way: \u201cAt the moment, some\ncancer fighting drugs are deemed uneconomical because they only work for\na certain subset of patients. If doctors\nhad a method of screening patients to\nsee whether these drugs work, then\nsuddenly these therapies would be\nmore cost effective to use.\u201d\n\u2018Snip Doctor\u2019 to test drug tolerance\nLast week felix reported that biofuel\ncrops may not be worth the effort, and\nrank high on environmental impact.\nIndeed, this may be true. Biofuel crops\nmust be grown upon arable land, fer-tilised, nurtured, harvested, and proc-essed. That\u2019s a lot of costs that lessen\nthe energy gain the resulting biofuel\nthat they provide. But wait! Members\nof Kingdom Plantae may yet save our\ncombustion-energy hungry lifestyles.\nLook under the swaying palm oil\nplantations, below the rolling green\ncornfields.\nLook to the greenish sludge choking up the water filled ditch and the\ncommon stream. There lies a carbon-neutral and theoretically inexhaustible\nsource of liquid fuel. It was the stuff\nyou had to scrub out of fish tanks, and\nthat you thought might kill you if you\nwent swimming in certain lakes of\nthe blue-green variety. It was around\nchanging the Earth\u2019s atmosphere millions of years ago.\nAlgae\nBefore I ramble on further, allow me\nto simply summarise for the lecture-weary of you how biofuel is extracted\nfrom plants. Plants photosynthesise\ncarbon dioxide and water into glucose\nand oxygen. (No sh*t, professor, I probably learnt that one before I knew how\nthe birds and the bees fitted together).\nThe glucose is used for energy or reassembled by the plant into anything\nelse it needs- proteins, carbohydrates,\nlipids\u2026 Lipids- essentially, oil. Therefore a plant contains oil, much as many\nother living organisms produce and\nstore oil.\nIf the oil can be extracted, it can\nbe converted into usable, burnable\nforms. Although ethanol from crop\nplants is used to make biodiesel, plant\noils can be made into biodiesel. By\ncompressing, by using enzymes, by\nfiring minute particles into cells, by\nmany means, oil can be extracted\nfrom plants to be processed and used,\nwhile the waste is used for fertiliser or\nanimal feed.\nEnter algae. Enter a plant of single\nor few cells that lives in water, reproduces rapidly, and produces oil. It does\nnot need tracts of arable land to grow\nupon, it can double in volume in a single day under the correct conditions,\nand known strains produce a 50%\nbody weight yield of oil, compared to\nsoybean, the current leading biodiesel\ncrop, which has a yield of 20% and a far\nlonger maturation time. With tens to\nhundreds of thousands of current and\nundiscovered species, finding higher\nyields is not unlikely- and, dare I say\nit, there\u2019s always genetic modification\nto consider. Currently, researchers\nestimate that one acre of algae could\nproduce up to 10000 gallons of oil per\nyear.\nWhat algae *does* need in order to\nbecome a feasible source of fuel are\ncleverly designed farms that optimise\nconditions without raising expensive\ncosts. Conveniently, such things are\nentirely possible with human ingenuity.\nThe 18th century economist, Thomas\nMalthus, famously placed unmoving,\nexponential limits on crop produce\nby tying their production to available\nland; the 20th century economist Ester\nBoserup removed this limitation by\ntheorising that human ingenuity and\ntechnology would respond to demand,\nand she has been largely proven right\ntill now.\nCurrently, several algae biodiesel\nplants are open and running in the US,\nwhile engineers work on improving\ndesigns of sealed growth vats, stirrers,\ngas venters.\nImagine a slew of algae biodiesel\nplants being built in rocky land inhospitable to crops, but perfect for\nwater-dwelling plants that only need\nsunlight, carbon dioxide, and water.\nImagine algae biodiesel plants constructed alongside traditional power\nplants to utilise the concentrated\nwaste carbon dioxide- such things are\nbeing planned.\nBased on its potential as both motor\nand jet fuel, the UK government has\nprovided the independent company\nThe Carbon Trust with initial funding\nof up to \u00a34 million for a Algae Biofuels Challenge, which is ultimately intended to commercialise an algae-oil\nbased biodiesel by 2020. Final project\ncosts are anticipated to be \u00a315-23 mil-lion, of which half will be funded by the\nCarbon Trust. In 2008 the U.S. military\nsigned two deals worth about $35 million to develop biodiesel made from\nalgae.\nAll this optimism sounds too good\nto be true. I know, I\u2019m a sourpuss too,\nreally. It can\u2019t be that easy- after all, researchers knew that algae could be a\nsource of biodiesel in the 1980s. Why\nhas the world been violently panicking\nabout petroleum costs, why did anyone bother to revive and design electric cars, were they just for fun? Dull\nday at the lab?\nWell, frankly, up until now, the cost\nof petroleum-derived fuel has just\nbeen too cheap in comparison. Prior\nto the credit crunch (don\u2019t ask me for\nupdates, I\u2019m scared enough just checking my bank balance, never mind current global prices), the production cost\nof algal oil was still at about \u00a32.80 /\nL, while petroleum diesel was lurking\naround $0.48 / L in the US. It still just\nwasn\u2019t cost effective to go green, and\npetroleum produces so many other,\nuseful things.\nNow? I can\u2019t help but see my future\nvisions of electric cars fading, the\nsaintly masochism of restricting car\njourneys for nothing short of emergen-cies. No Mad Max style riots at petrol\nstations over dwindling fuel, no wars\nfor foreign resources, no nuclear or\nhydrogen power taking centre stage,\nthe development of cold fusion pushed\nfurther into a theoretical future. But\nwho knows? There\u2019s plenty of scope for\nthe future to surprise us.\nAs it stands, however, it seems that\nalgae is the only biofuel crop with the\npotential to replace our need for petroleum diesel.\nFuture still green for biofuels\nAnnabel Slater\nScience Correspondent\nAn algae biodiesel plant design\n\u201c(Algae) can\ndouble in volume\nin a single day\nunder the correct\nconditions, and\n... produce a 50%\nbody weight yield\nof oil\u201d\nFelix Whitton\nScience Correspondent\nI\u2019m so happy to see other people love algae too!\n\u201cSome cancer\nfighting drugs are\nuneconomical\u201d\nPicture\nof\nthe\nWeek\nSlovakian\nRiver\nMist,\nby\nStephen\nGallagher\nWe\nwant\nto\nexhibit\nyour\nart.\nSend\nin\nyour\nphotographs.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

This intriguing type\nof event, which strikes fear into the\nhearts of middle-class parents, has the\npower to motivate entirely unreasonable and inexplicable behaviour in both\nthe hosts and the drunken revellers;\nalthough I\u2019m ready to admit, much of\nthe unreasonable behaviour is from\nmyself.\nA house party must be planned with\nmilitary precision and all possibilities\nmust be considered. We begin with\npreparing the home for the invasion of\n100+ people. Rooms are judged less on\ntheir aesthetic appeal or general com-fort, but on two simple factors, capacity and potential for increased capac-ity. I peer into the rubbish heap that is\nmy bedroom and I mentally re-arrange\nit, I remove pieces of furniture in my\nmind and imagine the added standing room that the desk might offer if\nit simply vanished from being. With\ngreat anguish I mentally dismantle the\npillow-fort (oh yes, I built a pillow-fort\nin my bedroom\u2026 you may scoff but I\nknow that secretly you want to sit in\nit and fight off an imaginary army of\nbarbarous Native Americans) but I am\nconsoled in the knowledge that there\nwill be more room for somebody to fall\nover, throw up or pass out (or perhaps\nall three in one humongous epic fail).\nCapacity is of course not the only\nconcern, there is always the worry of\nhaving your finest china tea set broken by an uninvited hoodlum. For to\nhear the sound of your prize crockery\nsmashing onto the kitchen floor followed by a group of your friends exclaiming \u201cBalls!\u201d must be the greatest\nfear of any house party host. Luckily I\nam not one of that group of people who\nown anything that could be described\nas \u2018china\u2019 but still there are a great deal\nof breakable, stealable and flammable\nobjects in my house. These must be\ntaken away from view and secured.\nWe have arbitrarily designated my\nroommate Carlos\u2019 bedroom as the\nstorage room and with merry abandon\nit has slowly become filled with every\nsingle piece of non-essential furniture\nin the house. The dining table, our\ndesks and every piece of electronic\nequipment; if it\u2019s not nailed down and\nindestructible, it\u2019s going into Carlos\u2019\nroom! Re-arranging an entire flat is by\nno means an easy task but after party-proofing my abode, it resembles a Cold\nWar nuclear bunker.\nThe next step, of course, is providing\nalcohol. Bring your own is an admirable idea but make a good house party it\ndoes not. If you don\u2019t provide alcohol\n(food isn\u2019t essential, have some dinner\nbefore you come) you are essentially\ninviting people to stand around your\nhouse; remember you\u2019re having a house\nparty not a political rally. Of course, as\na result alcohol constitutes the greatest\nexpense that one encounters but with\nsome experience and effort you can do\nit on the cheap. Indeed I have become\nthe greatest alcohol bargain finding\nfiend that mankind has ever known.\nDoubt it? Those bottles of vodka pictured above this text number 12, 12 litres of vodka in all. And the price? \u00a316.\nAh the wonders of tax-free diplomatic\nprivileges (I won\u2019t say anymore, I can\u2019t\ngive away all of my secrets).\nBut undeniably the thing that determines the success of a house party\nis attendance. Your belongings may\nbe safe and the alcohol may be cheap\nand plentiful but ultimately if you\u2019re\nalone this just means that when you\npass out after drinking alone you won\u2019t\nknock anything over. It\u2019s in the pursuit\nof a well-attended house party that I\nprobably exhibit the most peculiar be-haviour. Normally it\u2019s only our close\nfriends that are given the privilege of\ncrossing the threshold into our homes\nbut when it comes to house parties, I\nfind myself saying things like \u201cSure,\ncome along and bring some friends,\nextended relatives and anybody you\nhappen to meet on the way here\u201d and\nthis is to people that I\u2019ve met on the\nstreet. You of course are invited, you\njust have to find my house... a hint, it\u2019s\nin London.\nKadhim Shubber has 12 litres of dodgy vodka\n\u201cAh the wonders\nof tax-free\ndiplomatic\nprivileges (I won\u2019t\nsay anymore, I\ncan\u2019t give away all\nof my secrets)\u201d\nMark Mearing-Smith was \u2018pwned\u2019 by the\nRAG team. He put up a bloody good fight\nthough; it was eight on one\nS\ntrange thoughts go through\nyour mind when a bunch of\nfellow students raid your office dressed in RAG t-shirts\nand dust masks. Fantastic was not something I would have\nthought I would think in such a tight\nsituation.\nYou might or might not have heard\nthat on Tuesday evening the RAG team\nentered the Guilds Office to capture\nthe Guilds\u2019 violate mascots Spanner\nand Bolt. Go to Live! (live.cgcu.net) for\nfull details of the actual event.\nBut as with most situations involving mascotry there will be a hoard of\npeople who will shout \u201cWhat a waste\nof time\u201d, \u201cGet a life\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re not serving your student\u201d etc, ad nauseum. (I\u2019m\nsure by the time you are reading this\nLive! will be full of it). I don\u2019t subscribe\nto this mantra even in the slightest.\nHere is why.\nFirstly mascots can be used as an important focal point of a club. In organisation the equivalent is the logo, who\nmight give a PR/Media firms vast sums\nof cash to produce, as London 2012 interestingly puts it, an \u201cEmblem [that] is\nsimple, distinct, bold and buzzing with\nenergy.\u201d Obviously I\u2019m not calling for\nthe Union to spend it\u2019s cash reserves\non a flashy logo, but stating that it is totally normal to try and find something\nthat a group of people can feel a sense\nof loyalty to.\nSecondly it is a way of getting more\npeople involved with a Union. I must\nfirstly point out that it is only one of\nmany ways of building interest with\nnew students. My first position in\nGuilds was infact as Spanner Bearer.\nBut what everyone must be aware of is\nthat no event is ever totally inclusive.\nEven the Masquerade Ball, only had\nabout 10% of students attend, and mas-cotry is just another thing that we do.\nThirdly, and I believe the most defensible is that it raises money for char-ity, which if any reader is not a good\nthing then yours truly has truly no idea\nwhat is.\nBut let me get back to to the issue of\nwhy I was happy that our prized mascots were being stolen right in front of\nme. It was because some one was playing back. Over the last couple of years\nit has mostly been Guilds stealing the\nother mascots, with it all drying up\nwhen the other party said \u201cNo we are\nnot playing\u201d.\nWhat I believed was that we were so\nafraid of our own being stolen we never\nhad it out or even on display. I feel very\nstrongly that if you hide the mascots\nreally well (which is not very difficult)\nyou then completely stop mascotry in\nit\u2019s tracks. Even an old hack from the\nRCSU boasted that Theta Mark IX\nwas so well hidden with it split into 4\npieces all hidden by different people.\nIt is like having a silver dining service\nand never using it. You have to let them\nsmell blood.\nSo all I say now is that I hope Guilds\npaid the ransom, and that this light\nhearted fun may carry on, and be a lesson to everyone about realising that\nmost things in life should be fun and\ndon\u2019t knock the things that are.\nEnter a lab with Gilead Amit at your own risk\n\u201cThe technicians\nhave simply not\nbeen trained to\ndeal with walking\nstatistical anomalies\nsuch as myself\u201d\nI\nt is said of the physicist Wolfgang Pauli that he was a theoretician of such brilliance that his\nproximity to any piece of experimental apparatus was guaranteed to lead to faulty and inexplicable\nresults. His mere presence in a laboratory would cause complex wiring to\nfall apart and coloured smoke to rise\nfrom unexpected outlets in machinery.\nOnce, an unusual set of readings in a\nlaboratory in G\u00f6ttingen was explained\naway by Pauli\u2019s brief presence on a train\nplatform in that city, while waiting for\na transfer from Zurich to Copenhagen\nat the same hour.\nThis has since passed into physics\nfolklore as the Pauli Effect, which dictates that theoreticians of increasing\nability are responsible for ever larger\nPauli fields of experimental turbulence.\nThe resulting fields can be measured\nin units of explosions per second, litres of blood shed per unit of personnel present, or billions of dollars lost\nper minute spent in the laboratory. For\nobvious reasons, no exact value has yet\nbeen measured.\nI am intimately acquainted with this\nparticular problem. Expensive machinery was able to function only once\nPauli had left the city; by a doubtless\nsimilar effect the LHC could only be\nput into operation on the day I flew out\nof Geneva to start the term in London.\nI attribute the subsequent helium leakage on the 20th of September entirely\nto my having spent most of the day facing in a South-Easterly direction.\nNow, I am not claiming to be a theorist of Pauli\u2019s calibre. Not at all. I am\nperfectly content to be stuck with the\nwhirlwind of practical misadventure\nand misfortune without claiming any\nof the gift for theory that usually goes\nwith it. But I think I probably stand a\nchance of being at least as bad an experimental physicist as Pauli ever was.\nOr, indeed, is ever likely to be.\nAn old joke stuck to the office door\nof a mathematics teacher of mine\nprobably best sums up my attitude of\nmystified incompetence towards labo-ratories. \u201cTheory is when everyone\nknows everything, but nothing works.\nPractice is when everything works, but\nno one knows why. Here we combine\nTheory with Practice: Nothing works\nand no-one knows why.\u201d\nThat represents me in the laboratory \u2013 absolutely nothing works and I\nhave not the foggiest beginnings of an\noutline of a trace of a clue as to why.\nOften, neither do the poor lab technicians whose training did not extend to\nwalking statistical anomalies such as\nmyself. How are they supposed to explain why semiconductors capriciously\ndecide to catch fire at low tempera-tures? It\u2019s not their fault if overwhelming background radiation clouds my\nradioactivity detector like a solitary\nthunderstorm overshadowing a cartoon Bavarian castle. And they\u2019re certainly not responsible for the wicked\nsense of humour displayed by the apparently perfectly calibrated equip-ment. The inside of a laboratory is to\nme a vast and incomprehensible cave\nof wonders, where I play the role of\nAladdin \u2013 melting solid barriers with\na single touch.\nMy aura of incompetence follows me\neven into the comparatively safe and\nuneventful realm of the computing lab.\nAlone and confused at my keyboard,\nthe programming syntax errors I seem\nto come up with prompt horrified and\nconfused expressions from the demon-strators, who stare at me as though I\nhad just carved the code into the monitor with a USB stick.\nAs an aside, I don\u2019t know how many\nof you are familiar with the loveable\nidiosyncracies of C++, but I will say\nthat it goes a long way to explaining\nmy overfondness for semi-colons and\ncomplex, winding statements that\ngo on for far too long and objectively\nspeaking add very little to the flow and\ncoherence of a piece.\nFor six hours a week, therefore,\nwhen confined to a stuffy, overheated\nlaboratory full of uncommunicative\nequipment and marginally less expressive supervisors, I feel like I have been\nplaced in the queue for the waiting list\nto get into Purgatory. Stick a pen in my\nhand and give me a set of associative,\ndistributive and commutative variables\nto play with and I will be treading air.\nStick a radioactive source in my hand\nand give me an oscilloscope to play\nwith, however, and you will see the\npetulant child on Christmas morning\nwho is starting to doubt whether Santa\neven bothers to check his inbox.\nThere is only one solution open to\na student who derives as much enjoyment from lab as from scalding his\nhand on a boiling kettle and who has a\nfruit fly\u2019s grasp of experimental proce-dure. And that is to find a lab partner\nwhose tireless enthusiasm, unparalleled ability and experimental insight\nare such as to ensure that work gets\ndone, data gets measured and errors\nget calculated at every step of the way.\nThe problem, of course, is that the\nPauli Effect treats people as mercilessly as it does tape measures or particle\naccelerators. My lab partner, God Rest\nHis Soul, was once a bushy-cheeked,\nrosy-tailed maestro of an experimen-talist capable of reducing error bars\nat twenty paces and quelling rogue\nlightmeters with a raised eyebrow. My\nlack of hand-eye coordination and inability to find the on switch, however,\nhas gradually worn him down to a gibbering wreck of a physicist with an unhealthy glucose addiction for which I\nam largely responsible.\nThis, the sixth week of every term,\nis a tremendous week for me and all\nthose who share my affliction because\nthere are no laboratory sessions. The\nsame monotonous and relentless grind\npicks up again next Thursday, but\nin the mean time I am savouring the\nfresh air in my lungs, the time to mess\naround with mathematical symbols to\nmy heart\u2019s content, and the slow recovery from radiation poisoning.\nO, for the life of a theorist.\nO\nn a soggy Thursday\nnight, I was just nodding off for my perfectly\ntimed 9 minute nap on\nthe bus back home when\nthe sound of Imperial students woke\nme up. They weren\u2019t being particularly\nloud though. What woke me up in an\nalarmed arousal was what they were\ndoing. Two guys and one girl sitting\non the front row of the upper deck\nof a bus; with the window laden with\ncondensation, most people would take\nthis opportunity to draw a smiley face\nor sadly for most, a massively unrepresentative penis. Not these three crazy\nkids though. Instead, they were discussing mathematical symbols, using\nthe entire front upper window of the\nbus as it were a blackboard, there for\nthem note their ideas as they bounced\nthem off each other. This all within the\nthrilling discussion of coprimes and\ncontour integrals. As I looked around\nthe bus, commuters looked a little bewildered whilst fellow Imperial stu-dents, like me, were distinguishable by\ntheir heads in their hands, all in disbelief as we recieved this unwelcome and\nimpromptu lecture. However, my own\nDan Wan would do Fine Art, if he were \u2018cool\u2019\n\u201cAt school, I bet\nwe were the kind\nof kids that itched\nto have a serious\nconversation about\nscience once in a\nwhile.\u201d\nrhetorical questioning of \u201cdo they not\nhaving anything better to talk about\non the way home?\u201d sparked the same\nquestion, but not in the rhetorical\nsense. Did they actually have anything\nbetter to talk about on the way home?\nHow many times have you heard\nsomeone interrupt their own conver-sation, with a wry smirk on their face,\nand exclaim \u201cthis conversation is so\nImperial\u201d. Light titters in agreement\nensue. Then the conversation will,\nmore than likely, divert off the previous \u2018Imperial\u2019-esque subject.\nIt is just inevitable when you bring\nthousands of scientifically-tuned people together, ones that spend hours a\nday dedicating their mind to science,\nthat every day conversation will skirt\naround so-called \u2018geeky\u2019 topics. It is\nnot uncommon for a conversation to\nstart with the simple and casual question of \u2018What did you do today?\u2019 And\nwhen you\u2019ve spent the last 6 hours trying to purify DNA from bacteria, your\nanswer, is in all probability, going to\ninvolve the words \u2018purifying\u2019, \u2018DNA\u2019,\nand \u2018bacteria\u2019. The more inquisitive of\nus will then ask \u201cwhy?\u201d Since you\u2019re\nso proud to have actually successfully\ncompleted the horrifically long lab\nprocedure and yieled the expected re-sults, you answer the question \u201cwhy?\u201d\nso comprehensively you get ahead of\nyourself and suddenly, with a wry smirk\non your face, interrupt yourself and exclaim \u201cthis conversation is so\u2026..\u201d\nBut aren\u2019t we all just pretending we\nhave \u2018better\u2019 things to talk about? We\nwouldn\u2019t be here at an all-science and\nengineering university if weren\u2019t all\ngeeks underneath the layers of apparent cool. If we were that \u2018cool\u2019, we\u2019d\nprobably be doing what others per-cieve as a \u2018cool degree\u2019, like Fine Art\nat Goldsmiths. I mean at school, I bet\nwe were the kind of kids that itched to\nhave some sort of serious conversation\nabout science once in a while.\nMy point is, if two Philosophy students were having a conversation about\nSchopenhauer\u2019s criticisms of Neo-Hegelianism, I doubt anyone would bat an\neyelid about how much their pub-talk\nresembled the work of their degrees.\nHaving, or at least thinking you\u2019re\nhaving, a deep conversation about the\nbeginnings of life or the boundaries of\nman-made law whilst baked-off-your-face may prove to have some value.\nYou may think in different avenues\nyou wouldn\u2019t do whilst sober. Some of\nthe most influential music and art are\nproducts of substance-use. I believe\nyour best, along with your very worst\nideas come to you whilst not fully in\ncontrol of yourself. I\u2019m sure any recording artist in the 1960s would agree\n(The short chorus of The Beatle\u2019s Yellow Submarine is sufficient to prove\nmy point). However, drink and science\ndo not mix. I\u2019ve been told that on a\nvodka-fuelled night out, I once mentioned to a girl that her dress looked\nlike it had immature B lymphocytes\non it. She was either not impressed or\nutterly confused, and either way, that\nshort-lived conversation died on its\nfeet right there at the bar.\nWe\u2019ve all seen the hundreds of common situations to be found at Imperial\non the \u2018 You know when you go to Imperial when\u2026.\u2019 Facebook group. Yes,\nmost of them are true, but aren\u2019t we all\na little bit proud to realise we do most\nof the points listed?\nIsn\u2019t it something that we even have\nthe knowledge of these subjects to have\na conversation about it? It comes down\nto the fact that, if we weren\u2019t genuinely\ninterested, we wouldn\u2019t be at an all-sci-ence university doing a science degree,\nand we wouldn\u2019t be willing to hold the\nfew lines of conversation about science\nbefore you interrupted yourself, with\nthat wry smile on your face.\nHowever, I am not trying to insinuate every single one of us talks about\nour degrees for 25 hours of the day (Al-though I do have a friend that prefers\nto subconsciously quote the second\nlaw of thermodynamics over and over\nagain rather than snore or anything\nelse relatively normal whilst sleeping.)\nI have met people at Imperial that have\na passion in art or literature equal to\nthat of the passion they have for the\nsubject of their course.\nIt is not Imperial that has brought us\nto talking about physics or chemistry in\nthe pub. It\u2019s something that\u2019s been hidden away inside all of us since the moment we realised that physics, chemistry or any other subject, was what we\nwanted to be doing for the next three,\nat the very least, years of our lives. We\nshould all embrace the fact we have\nlike-minded people, in terms of interest and intellect, as our best friends,\nlab partners and even as enemies.\n\u201cI hope that the\nransom is paid and\nthis light-hearted\nfun carries on\u201d\nThe RAG team still has Mark locked up in their basement...\n\n"

Well not\nanymore. He has now stopped making\nthem, but whatever. Anyway here I am\ntelling him everything that makes my\nlife so busy, stressful and exciting at\nthe same time. I would regale the long\nand some what entertaining stories to\nyou, however there is no where near\nenough space. Sorry.\nI will tell you one story. The tale of\nthe mascots. In particular the CGCU\nmascots (Spanner and Bolt) and the\nRSM mascot (The Davy). Both unions\nare fiercely protective of their mascots,\nand are probably prepared to throw\na few punches to ensure the safety of\nthese immensely heavy metal trophies.\nWell as the story goes RAG (that\u2019s\nICU RAG, not ICSM) bum rushed the\nCGCU office, and stole Spanner and\nBolt, successfully might I add. After\nsecuring the oversized spanner and\nbolt, it was place in a high tech, maximum security location. Known only to\na select few individuals with national\nRavi Pall\nCoffee Break Editor\nsecurity clearance. Seriously these\nguys p0wn MI6. Yes I just wrote p0wn,\ntough! Somehow though, the Spanner\nwas stolen from RAG (making this location not so secure). Whadafuh?\nThis was a seriously not cool move.\nWho would steal from a charity? Many\nsuspected RSM (Royal School of Mines\nfor those that don\u2019t know). Would you\nknow it, the RSM played to these suspi-cions, and organised a trade (previous-ly in the year CGCU stole the Davy).\nThe trade was the Davy for Spanner\nand Bolt, to which CGCU agreed.\nThe meeting time 11 PM, the meeting\nplace Queens lawn. Come 11:30 there\nwas no sign of RSM, Could this be a\nploy to steal the Davy and not return\nSpanner and Bolt? Or do they even\nhave Spanner and Bolt at all? Turns out\nthey didn\u2019t. The RAG committee got a\ntext in the late hours of last Wednesday\nnight, detailing Spanner had been buried in a certain location. RAG quickly\nrecovered the giant tool, and there\nwere no longer any lost mascots. Good\ntimes. All in all, we are now in happy\ntimes. CGCU paid a ransom to RAG,\nwhich all goes to charity.\nAlso too many texts this week, the\ncat phone actually caught on fire, so\nkeep them coming!\nRAG-tacular!\nTop Trumps\nCut them out!\nHighest score\nwins\nCollect them all!\nWatch this\nspace for\nadditional cards\nBattle of the Chamberlains\nKnown from:\nParticle Physics\nBiggest Achievement:\nTogether with Emilio Segr\u00e8, they discovered the presence of antiprotons, a\nsub-atomic antiparticle which earned\nthem both the Nobel Prize in 1959.\nEducation:\nDartmouth College, University of California, Berkeley,University of Chicago.\nDiseases:\nDiagnosed with Parkinson in 1985.\nFact:\nHe was a member of Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov, and Shcharansky, three\nphysicists of the former Soviet Union\nimprisoned for their political beliefs.\nKnown from:\nPolitics\nBiggest Achievement:\nWas made British Prime Minister in\n1937 when Stanley Baldwin retired after the abdication of Edward VIII.\nEducation:\nMason Science College.\nDiseases:\nBowel Cancer.\nFact:\nSigned the Munich Agreement in 1938,\nconceding the Sudetenland region of\nCzechoslovakia to Germany.

Nominations have now been open for\na week and already there are some candidates who have enough seconders to run, which should hopefully lead\nto an interesting and fiercely contested election period. As part of its build up, felix decided to carry out a little survey of the student population, asking students around campus if they recognised the lovely faces below\nand if they knew what they do. To add a bit of spice to it all, we also threw in the two of our regular columnists,\nAngry Geek and Imperial Girl, just to see if they were more known around campus than the Sabbatical Officers. Not giving\nanything away, but the results were certainly interesting.\nIn conjunction with the survey, Dan Wan and Kadhim Shubber also interviewed the current Sabbatical Officers, asking\nthem about their achievements, their failures and their role in the Union. The Union\u2019s slogan for this year\u2019s election is \u2018Stand\nand Deliver.\u201d Have the current Sabbaticals delivered and could what they say entice you to stand too? We were also going to\nget the felix editor in, but that would have ruined the page, so we didn\u2019t.\nElections 2009\nSo, what does your role in the Union entail?\nWell, I\u2019m the Deputy President of Clubs and Societies, and essentially its what it says on the box. I\u2019m here to represent the needs and interests of different\nclubs and societies, and most of what I do is as a mediator, either between individuals and different clubs, or within a club. One of the largest tasks as\nmediator is between clubs and societies and College.\nWhat have you enjoyed about your role this year?\nSo many things, its been amazing to meet all the different people and get the chance to meet all the students who run clubs and societies. As a sabbati-cal, you can actually make a difference. Also, there\u2019s been various events, which I\u2019ve organized and found incredibly rewarding to do so, one of these\nbeing Freshers\u2019 Fair. It was loads of work and loads of stress, but at the end of the day, it was so incredibly rewarding its unbelievable.\nHow did you decide you wanted to take up your role as Deputy President of Clubs and Societies?\nI\u2019d always be involved in different clubs and societies, as just as a member and running them. I wanted to take it to the next level and see if I could\nmake a difference.\nSo what do you think is needed to carry out your job, and do you think prior experience of lower authority is vital?\nIt is not the case that if you haven\u2019t been a club chair, you can\u2019t be DPCS. It\u2019s not that black and white, but it is important to know how clubs and\nsocieties work, what and how things will affect the students involved in them, and to have an understanding of clubs and societies in respect\nto the Union.\nWhat do you think was the greatest benefit for you personally in taking a sabbatical year out of studying/ finding a real job to take?\nThe experiences, I think. They\u2019re not something I would not have ever been able to have anywhere else or any other situation.\nWas it a nice break away from studies?\nI would say for anyone wanting to run, do not do it because you want a break from your studies.\nIt is totally not a break from your studies.\nIt is hard work and very stressful, but it is an absolutely wonderful experience. I don\u2019t think you can go into it thinking you\u2019re going to doss around and be able\nto do nothing for a year, because you won\u2019t.\nHave you managed to achieve any of the goals you set out at the start of the year? If not, why not?\nObviously, everyone has their main manifesto points. My main one was to make things easier, or to at least explain things better to people running clubs, and\nI think we\u2019ve made a good effort, but we\u2019re still to see how effective we\u2019ve been through a Clubs and Societies survey. The Clubs and Societies Handbook was\nto especially put all the information about running a club into one book, and I\u2019ve had feedback that its been really useful. So, hopefully that will be developed\nand kept going.\nWhat major change would you like to see happen to the Union in the following years?\nThis should be done by the end of the year, but the completion of the Beit Development, as well as the parts of the building such as the Ground floor that have\nnot been touched in this redevelopment. We do need to do something to the building to give the students, clubs and societies the facilities they deserve.\nLastly, why should people stand for DPCS?\nBecause you can really make a difference.\nSo, what does your role in the Union entail?\nLooking after the best interests of the Union and most importantly our members. The President is ultimately responsible for everything, but day to day\nthen, cattle prodding the Union\u2019s minions; clearing up the day to day crises; being (realisticly) strategic and visionary about the Union\u2019s direction and\ngetting the students voice raised at the highest levels of College, whilst maintaining good relations.\nWhat have you enjoyed about your role this year?\nBeing in charge of a multi-million organisation aged 22 is quite an experience! Bringing changes that benefit the student community is incredibly\nrewarding and engaging with the most brilliant people! It\u2019s such a pleasure to have worked with people who genuinely care about students of Imperial College like the Rector, Lord Robert Winston, Ram Gidoomal and so many others!\nHow did you decide you wanted to be President? It\u2019s a mighty task to take on.\nI\u2019ve always been a bit of a rebel and I\u2019ve never liked being told what to do, especially if its rubbish, like a stupid rule or regulation. If something\nneeds changing then let\u2019s do it! In all my roles at ICU I\u2019ve been able to do that, but it wasn\u2019t always so easy, I think a really strong factor in me\nrunning for President was actually to try and make it easier for everyone to get their voices heard.\nWhat do you think was the greatest benefit for you personally in taking a sabbatical year out of studying/ finding a real job to take?\nLearning about how a large organisation runs warts and all at a very young age will certainly put me in a good position for the future. It\u2019s also\nbeen an opportunity of a lifetime which will always be one of my greatest achievements and I count myself very lucky indeed.\nWhat do you think is needed to carry out your job?\nEnthusiasm, courage and heart. You\u2019ve got 12500 students to represent and often what you\u2019ve got to say to the bigwigs won\u2019t be pleasant\nbut you need to learn to stand your ground or compromise if you have to get the best possible deal for the students. You can\u2019t be overly\nsensitive, as president you have to take some tough decisions and you can\u2019t always please everyone. And let me take this opportunity to\ndispel the myth that you have to be top of your class and have sailed through Imperial to stand for a sabbatical position.\nHave you managed to achieve any of the goals you set out at the start of the year? If not, why not?\nI have reached most and I\u2019m confident that by the end of the year it will be all. But the real challenge is achieving all the goals you set when you actually get into\nposition, you\u2019re perspective changes a lot as you learn more and more and you keep coming up with ideas, so a key skill is being able to prioritise.\nDo you think the student body really care about what the sabbaticals do?\nThe Union has a long way to go in making students aware of what the Union can do for them that\u2019s for sure. Imperial\u2019s never going to be revolutionary, that\u2019s not\nin the nature of our subjects here, but we\u2019re sensible. So, no not enough do care, we need to improve the numbers drastically, but some people will never give\ntwo hoots and that\u2019s fine too, as long as we\u2019re providing the best possible service to all our members, even in terms of the bar and entertainment,\nWhat would you say to the fact that the majority of students recognise Angry Geek\u2019s face and name more sp than they do yours?\nGenerally people become a sabbatical to bring benefits to the students; less of a priority is getting the credit for it and I think it\u2019s fantastic that we have a newspaper that can bring that level of fame to its writers!\nHas the role been what you expected?\nIt\u2019s been ten times harder but also ten times more rewarding.\nSo, what does your role in the union entail ?\nI\u2019m in charge of all the finances for the union, as well as the clubs and societies finances. Dealing with all of the clubs and society\u2019s enquiries takes a lot of\nyour time, the rest of the time is for union things like commercial services.\nWhat have you enjoyed most about you job this year?\nI would say getting to know people, it\u2019s quite an interactive job, especially with the clubs and societies. You also get to go to lots of cool events; the\nSummer Ball, for example!\nWhat can you tell us about the summer ball?\nAh, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s top secret the moment! It\u2019s going to be good though\u2026\nWhat do you think are the key skills needed to do your job?\nYou have got to be approachable, have good interaction skills with people and be able to have a friendly chat because a lot of the clubs and societies officers come to see you and often they can be quite intimidated by being up in the union offices, so you want to make them feel welcome.\nYou\u2019ve also got to have a sound head on your shoulders, because you\u2019ve got to deal with an awful a lot of money and have a lot of financial re-sponsibility. And I think you\u2019ve really got to care about the Union, if you don\u2019t care about the union you don\u2019t stand a chance of doing anything\nbeneficial.\nHave you managed to achieve most of the main goals set out in your manifesto, as yet?\nFunnily enough, most of the things I had in my manifesto were actually achieved by my predecessor before he left the job last year! There\nwere are a couple of things to do improving the clubs and societies finance systems, like the new online transaction systems and the new\nbudgeting system- they had a few things to sort out. which are now finished, and they\u2019re working well. The next stage is to get claims forms\netc. fully automated online, which is really kicking off now \u2013 that will be something nice for my successor to take on, I think.\nDo you think the student body really cares about all of your efforts, in the sense that I guess your job isn\u2019t really that visible?\nYeah, I think mine\u2019s the least visible of the Sabatical positions, the main people I really deal with are the clubs officers. I think people do care, at least I think\nthe clubs care, but I don\u2019t think anyone else really knows or cares at all, half the student population probably don\u2019t even know what a sabbatical is and the rest\nprobably can\u2019t even remember who they voted for!\nHow does that make you feel? Imean, we did a survey and more people knew who Angry Geek and Imperial Girl are\u2026\nErm, it\u2019s not depressing or anything like that! It\u2019s perfectly understandable; I hesitate to say we work in the background, we don\u2019t - we should be out there, but\nthere are an awful lot of students and those that take an interest in the Union know about us and know who we are, if the rest aren\u2019t really interested that\u2019s fine.\nHas your role been as you expected it to be when you first began the job?\nYes and no. The clubs stuff is as I expected it to be and that\u2019s half the job, but there\u2019s a lot of behind the scenes work that you don\u2019t know about, and wouldn\u2019t,\nunless you had a one-on-one chat with the DPFS. To an extent, I got that from Chris [Larvin]- but this why I put a note in felix saying people should come and\nchat with me if they\u2019re thinking of standing because they should have a real idea of the role before they stand!\nOne final question, and it\u2019s going to be a shameless plug for the Summer Ball! Do you think known as the DPFS who gave the best Summer Ball ever?\nHopefully. I will say, I can\u2019t tell you anything about it, but it\u2019s going to be epic- we\u2019ve got some really good stuff going on!\nWhat does your role in the Union entail?\nI represent students on academic and welfare issues, both to College and nationally, as well as informing and consulting students about academic and\nwelfare issues and campaigns.\nWhat have you enjoyed most about your job this year?\nMeeting people in college that you would never have had contact with as a student.\nMeeting people in College has been the most fun thing about your year?\nYeah! Realising there are really astute people within College, who care about student issues, that\u2019s something you never realise as a student.\nWhy did you decide to stand for the position of Deputy President of Education and Welfare?\nErm, I was quite involved in extra-curricular activities, I\u2019ve really enjoyed participating in this side of College, so much so it was interfering with\nmy degree, so I thought I should take a whole year out, to get it all out of my system!\nWhat do you think has been the biggest benefit to you, personally, from this year?\nI\u2019ve learned to express my views, stand up for myself and stand up for what students believe in. So next year, when I\u2019m being bullied by a con-sultant, during ward rounds, I won\u2019t be reduced to a quivering mess. I\u2019ve learned a lot about how to achieve things by talking things through\nand finding mutual benefits; there\u2019s no point in going in all-guns-blazing, all that does is alienate people- both students and College staff.\nThat brings me on to my next question; what do think you you need to be able to carry out your job?\nYou need to passionate, but you need to have a level head too. You need to be able to make your point without alienate people and a willingness to put in a lot of hours.\nHave you achieved all of the goals you set out at the start of your term?\nNot at all! There\u2019s so much more I would have liked to have done; there\u2019s personal passions such as providing more information on welfare\ncampaigns, greater progress on environmental policy and green at Imperial, which had to take a back-burner.\nWhy do you think you haven\u2019t achieved your goals?\nNot enough hours in the day! I spend the vast majority of my day in meeting, which are really productive, but other tasks, like responding to emails, have to be\ndone out of hours. That means weekends are taken up by bigger projects, evenings by answering emails, and there\u2019s only so much you can physically do before\nyou start going to bed and dreaming about Outlook reminders!\nDo you think students appreciate what you do?\nMy greatest frustration, this year, has been my lack of an ability to communicate to the students about what I\u2019m doing for them on a day-to-day basis. A lot of\nthe changes they\u2019ve seen, that impact on their education and welfare, have been through student efforts in the past. But unless we\u2019ve been able to communicate\nthis to the students through felix or through face-to-face meetings, it\u2019s almost completely pointless.\nSo, does it frustrate you that more people recognise Imperial Girl and Angry Geek than the sabbatical?\n(laughs) I don\u2019t know what more I could have done! I\u2019ve appeared in felix almost as frequently either Angry Geek or Imperial Girl, it worries me that the subject\nmatter they\u2019re writing about is more engaging to the readers- but I think that\u2019s just a reality of student politics.\n\n"

I, looking forward to a Friday\nnight of cosy slouching around, am less\nthan sure. Mentioning the last Indiana\nJones film brings a sour taste to my\nmouth, like bile, and I\u2019m not enthused\nby westerns. To cut the story short,\nshortly afterwards we are hustling\ninto a cinema to watch the film on its\nopening night. The audience is pretty\nsparse and there are no problems finding seats.\nMy knowledge of South Korean cinema is pretty limited to Park Chanwook\u2019s chilling Vengeance trilogy \u2013 despite having lived in Seoul for a year,\nI spent most of my TV time watching\nglossy Korean soaps and historical\nmelodramas where understanding of\nthe spoken language is entirely arbitrary to understanding the plot. Nonetheless, I anticipated that if The Good,\nthe Bad, the Weird would be anything\nlike the few films I had seen, it would\nmost likely be visually slick and good\nlooking, with bits of dark violence, interesting camera angles, hints of black\ncomedy and intense, moody stars.\nIt is. It is all of that, and then some.\nThe Good, the Bad, the Weird is inspired by Sergio Leone\u2019s The Good, the\nBad and the Ugly. The three protagonists referred to in the title are Yoon\nTae-goo (Song Kang-ho) \u2013 \u2018the Weird\u2019\n(and endearingly so) \u2013 a carelessly\nreckless, middle-aged gangster, Park\nChang-I (Lee Byung-hun) \u2013 \u2018the Bad\u2019, \u2013\na psychotic and sadistic young gangster\nwith a penchant for tailored suits, floppy hair and knives (as these types do\u2026)\nand Park Do-won (Jung Woo-sung) \u2013\n\u2018the Good\u2019 \u2013 a young, unflappable and\nenigmatic bounty hunter. The action\nin the film starts almost right away\nwith a rowdy train-robbery by two of\nthe protagonists and it scarcely lets\nup from thereon. Intensely colourful\nand cluttered sets are smashed up by\nflying bullets and dying henchmen as\nYoon Tae-goo procures a precious and\nmysterious treasure map from travelling aristocrats, taking him across\nthe desert plains and towns of 1930s\nManchuria with Park Chang-yi and\nhis nasty cronies in hot pursuit. The\nfilm is a peculiar mix of wild action,\nextreme violence and quirky comedy.\nTae-goo provides the film\u2019s comedic\nmoments by his pained expressions of\nharassment and sheer disregard for the\ndeadly forces pursuing him. Do-won\nappears to be the film\u2019s calm, moral\ncentre and steady hand. Chang-I is\nsimply, purely disturbing \u2013 what the\nfilm provides in intense visual colour\nand detail, it also provides in graphic\ngore and I had to fervently close my\neyes at certain points of the film when\nChang-I brought out his knives.\nUnfortunately, the thin plot of the\nfilm \u2013 \u2018life is about chasing, and being\nchased\u2019 \u2013 cannot stand up to the eventual pacing and credibility, which really\nbegins to falter in the final third. There\nis an initially amusing (but then interminably long) chase-scene across the\ndesert involving horses, motorbikes,\njeeps, machine guns, packs of vengeful Manchurian bandits, gun wielding gangsters, the unflappable bounty\nhunter and a section of the Japanese\narmy who are depicted as Shakespearian-ly evil. But by the convoluted end of\nit, I found that I no longer particularly\ncared what the treasure would turn out\nto be and wished the protagonists \u2013\nfriend, foe or weird alike \u2013 would hurry\nup and bump each other off. The characters\u2019 lack of depth had carried on for\ntoo long and I found myself bored and\ncaringlessforthe\u2018good\u2019guys.Although\nNot a masterpiece, but close\nFew films, debut films at that, have\nmanaged to portray the grandness and\nthe pitfalls of youth as accurately as\nJoachim Trier\u2019s Reprise. The Norwegian production, first released in 2006,\nhas garnered a significant amount of\nrecognition at awards and festivals\naround the world, particularly Europe.\nMost praise was aimed at the young\nDanish director who certainly is one\nto look out for. However, it would be\na severe shortcoming to ignore the\nquality of his film as a whole, an authentic and complex rendering of the\nemotions and experiences two friends,\nPhillip (Anders Danielsen Lie) and Erik\n(Espen Klouman-H\u00f8iner), go through\nin their search for fulfilment.\nThe two are both young, aspiring\nwriters, filled with idealism and a craving to establish themselves as creative individuals in their world, which\nleads them to different paths along the\ntreacherous cliffs of young adulthood.\nPhillip, on the one hand, finds himself\nintoxicated with an obsession of love\nwhich turns him into a confused mess\nand leaves him searching for lost time.\nErik, on the other hand, is driven by his\nambitions, hardly holding his own on\nloose moral ground. The film explores\ntheir anxieties, their attitude towards\nfriendship and the world around them,\ntheir grand clich\u00e9s seemingly disguised as originality, their uniqueness\nobscured by their commonality. It\u2019s\nsuch an overwhelmingly truthful ex-perience, that it made me wonder why\nI sacrificed the perennially ambiguous\nmeritocracy of the artistic plane for the\ncalm and prescriptive life of a business\ngraduate.\nStill, I\u2019ve come across a few complaints in reviews of this film and they\nmostly relate to the excessive editing,\nthe muddled narrative or the seemingly\nuneventful storyline. Unfortunately, it\u2019s\nhard to argue against such statements,\nas everyone finds his or her own bal-ance, especially in terms of what is excessive and what is uneventful. However as far as the narrative goes, even if\nit may seem a bit raw at times, as long\nas the viewer is immersed in the film, I\nsincerely doubt there will be any issues\npertaining to the comprehension or\nthe logical coherence of the story.\nIn conclusion, I won\u2019t go so far as\nto claim that Reprise is a masterpiece\nbut it is certainly has my vote as one of\nthe not-quite-so-many good films released of late which really spoke to me\nin a substantial way. There are several\nthings to enjoy about it and even a few\nto contemplate when it\u2019s finished, in\nwhat amounts to a poignant and well-articulated piece of art.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nthe finale of the film delivered a couple\nof twists, I felt as though my enthusiasm for the film\u2019s odd, scrambled mix\nof tones and genres had waned and I\ndid not feel particularly bothered by\nthe sudden revelations in the ending.\nOverall, this is still an entertaining\npiece of action, a messy but great-look-ing, rowdy, Korean-Western. While\nmoments of harsh violence may kill\nyour smiles as much as daft moments\nwill make you chuckle, I was sufficiently entertained to be glad I forsook\na Friday evening of slouching, and instead spent a couple of hours rushing\nalong with Tae-yoon through the Manchurian desert. No Raiders of the Lost\nArk, but no Crystal Skull, either.\nBleak, dark and sexy. What more do\nyou expect from a film about vampires and werewolves? For those of\nyou who may not know, Underworld:\nRise of the Lycans is a prequel to\n2003\u2019s sleeper hit Underworld and\nits follow-up Underworld Evolution,\nso it covers no new ground \u2013 just a\nsub-plot from the first film that was\nbriefly mentioned as the motive for a\ncharacter\u2019s crusade of vengeance.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen the first two films\nthen this film will seem original and\nintriguing, although you may find\nyourself lost in a sea of pre-established\ncharacters and codes for this already\nwell-developed alternative reality.\nBut whether or not you have seen the\nother films, Underworld: Rise of the\nLycans is a stylish action/horror that\nyou can sink into and lose yourself in\nfor an hour and a half \u2013 that is if you\nenjoy fast-paced action, gory horror\nand sexy vampires.\nSet hundreds of years ago, a community of vampires living within a\nhuge castle in an undisclosed European country decide to use werewolves\nas their slaves. Now this is where the\ntricky definitions appear: werewolves\nare vicious, monstrous beasts transformed from humans into overgrown\ncanines. Lycans are werewolves that\ncan control their transformations and\ncan change back to human form, keeping their humanity, logic and thoughts\nintact while they are in wolf-form. If\nyou don\u2019t understand that, think it\nis stupid or don\u2019t care, then maybe\nyou should stop reading now and not\nbother watching this film. It is, after\nall, the only bit of thinking you have to\ndo throughout the course of the entire\nfilm, but if it is too much for you then\nmaybe horror just isn\u2019t your thing.\nFor the rest of you: werewolves are\ntoo dangerous to vampires and so are\nforced into the forests, whereas Lycans\nare kept within the citadel as slaves.\nLucian (Sheen), the very first Lycan,\nis the trusted and valued leader of\nthe Lycans and he works for Viktor\n(Nighy), the \u2018big daddy\u2019 and ruler of\nthe vampire world.

To be fair, why kill a perfectly profitable series when the\nnew films still manage to be entertaining, sexy and action-packed, as Jonathan Dakin reveals this week. Reprise HHHHH\nDirector: Joachim Trier\nWriter: Joachim Trier & Eskil\nVogt\nCast: Anders Denielsen-Lie,\n\tEspen Klouman-Hoiner,\nVictoria Winge\nReprise is a piece of art that should not be missed by anyone; it\u2019s\na film debut that has put Scandinavian movies back in the game\nAh, to be young and carefree again! Those where the days...\nShot on location in London, Gerald\nMcMarrow\u2019s first full-length feature\nis different and original enough to be\nmentioned.\nIt\u2019s hard to summarise the plot without giving away the not-so-surprising\nconclusion but that\u2019s actually not a\nproblem because the movie\u2019s strength\nis not its imaginative storyline which,\neven for a fairy tale, is slightly too unre-alistic. What makes Franklyn stand out\nis the pristine detail of the wonderfully\noffbeat, decidedly sombre and murky\nworld created by the camera, scenery,\nComing Out Soon\nmake-up and visual effects.\nRyan Phillippe, Eva Green, Sam Riley and Bernard Hill play four souls\ninhabiting two parallel worlds (con-temporary London and Meanwhile\nCity) whose lives are interweaved by\nfate, tragedy and, of course, love. As\nthese worlds come closer together\nour heroes (or rather anti-heroes) go\nthrough the process of self-discovery\nthat comes to a gripping climax when\nMeanwhile City and our beloved London collide.\nSounds a bit childish, but believe\nme, this is one fairytale you would not\nwant your child to see. Unless you like\nfreaking out little kids, that is.\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nSee London as you\u2019ve never seen it before\nin this noir fairytale \u2013 Franklyn\nEva Green ditches her Bond-girl look for a disturbing emo-goth one.\nhot vampire daughter Sonja (Mitra),\nwhich is seen as an abomination as the\ntwo races should never get too intimate with one another. A very strong\nRomeo and Juliet love theme quickly\ndevelops and when impending doom\nsuddenly embraces the lives of those\nwithin the fortress, Lucian decides\nthat it is time the Lycans made a stand\nfor themselves, cast off their shackles,\nand be free to live life how they want.\nFilledwithmanyracialanalogiesand\nsword-wielding violence, I don\u2019t think\nI have ever seen an action film attempt\nto make such a profound point before.\nPerhaps I was reading too much into\nit, but even so the film works on many\ndifferent levels which makes it even\nmore enjoyable.\nWith good performances from all\nthe central roles, including screen siren Rhona Mitra who burns up every\nscene with her incredible sexiness,\nserved alongside a healthy dollop of\ngore and monster slaying, Underworld:\nRise of the Lycans does exactly what it\nsays on the tin. Although the plot will\nseem strange to someone who has no\nidea about the films that preceded it\nand there are a few slow-scenes too\nmany, overall the film is an interest-ing, paint-by-numbers action film.\nSaying that, there is a very unexpected\nending but this twist will only come as\na shock to those who have not yet seen\nthe first Underworld film.\nThe directing is okay but some of the\nquick cuts can be confusing and irri-tating, although the Matrix-like slow\nmotion looks cool but lacks original-ity. The director is trying his best, but\ncan\u2019t compete with the director of the\nprevious films, Len Wiseman, who\nwas much better at building suspense\nand atmosphere.\nSo if you want to begin your journey\ninto the world of vampires and were-wolves, I\u2019m sure that this is probably\nthe best place to start, as the films\nthat follow it chronologically are well\nworth-seeing.

    "content": "6 felix Friday 20 February 2009 7\nFriday 20 February 2009 felix\nLast week we met the man and found out about his past\nas a student at Imperial. Now we look into what he really\nthinks of the higher education system, the government\nand Imperial\u2019s role in research and development. Jovan\n\u2018John Humphrys\u2019 Nedi\u0107 and Tom \u2018Jeremy Paxman\u2019\nRoberts report back from their epic interview last week.\nThe government\nand the higher\neducation system\nTeaching time and research split\nfelix\nDo you not think this business side of things affect the student life\nbecause for the last seven years or so, the researching hours have\ngone up by about 10% but teaching hours have dropped by about\n5%. Do you think that there is too much focus on research and not\non teaching like there should be?\nRector\nNo I don\u2019t actually. I have no trouble with high quality researchers\nsaying that they don\u2019t have time for teaching. Very very good people in their discipline are almost invariably very good teachers, and\nthere is a trivial reason for that; if you\u2019re very good at your subject\nand can understand it well, then it will be easy for you to pass on\nthat information. Good researchers will be good teachers.\nfelix\nSo would you say that teaching hours will increase over the next\nfew years?\nRector\nI\u2019ll be brutally honest here, so much depends on the economic climate and the attitude of the government in the coming years and\nhow we come out over the next few years. If the volume of money\nfor research, whether that comes from businesses or the govern-ment, is severely stretched, then maybe we will have to spend more\ntime on taught degrees which will see the teaching hours rise.\nWe also might need to focus on international teaching. Every year\nwe get a huge number of internationals students applying, who do\nhave exceptional qualifications and we could take double or triple\nthe number, but we don\u2019t have the space available here so that is\nwhy it might lead to a footprint overseas.\nSetting up an overseas footprint\nfelix\nIn your Commemoration Day speech you also mentioned the possibility of Imperial setting up footprints overseas, and in a recent\ninterview with the Financial Times you said that there were a few\nplaces where a campus might be set, with locations such as India,\nChina, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. Is there any particular reason for choosing these places?\nRector\nWell, first of all, where do we get most of our students? Then also\nthere is a slightly different reason for the Emirates. They are the\nmost liberal Arab communities in the world in terms of structural organisation which one can have some empathy with. For example the\nrulers are very oil wealthy and they want to use that wealth to firstly\nimprove the health of their peoples, secondly to improve the system\nof education from primary all the way up to higher education and\nthirdly that they want to be remembered in world history for being\nthe source of the generation of technologies for after oil and after\ngas, in other words non carbon technologies. Now those three visions are something that we can empathise with very strongly with\nhere so that makes that part of the world very attractive.\nThe story behind top-up fees and what Imperial\nCollege Union thinks about them\nIn his eight-year reign at Imperial, the one topic that the previous Rector Sir Richard Sykes was vocally\nin favour of was top-up fees. After only a year into the job in 2002, he, along with a number of ViceChancellors from leading universities, all stated that they would be in favour of increasing the price\nof tuition fees if the government lifted its cap on the then price of \u00a31,100 a year. Whereas most of the\nRussell Group universities \u2013 the UK\u2019s answer to the Ivy League \u2013 said that they would probably increase\nthe price to about \u00a33,000 a year, Sir Richard Sykes mentioned that he would much prefer a value of\naround \u00a310,500 a year.\nRather unsurprisingly, this value angered a lot of students, as they could not see why higher education would cost so much with some arguing that \u201ceducation should be free and accessible to all\u201d. The\nthen Rector\u2019s reasoning behind it all was a simple, business-minded one. He stated that, back in 2002,\nit costs Imperial College \u00a310,500 to train a student, yet they only receive \u00a36,000 per student from the\nHigher Education Funding Council as well as the \u00a31,100 tuition fee from the student itself. This left a gap\nof \u00a33,400 per student, or a total of around \u00a318 million a year back in 2002.\nThe argument that followed then is the same one today. Where should the money come from? There\nare two main options available to the Vice-Chancellors and Rectors of the different universities in the\nUK; they can either increase the tuition fee to cover the costs or the government can increase the\namount of money given to the institutions.\nIn his interview with felix, Sir Roy Anderson was very clear on his thoughts on the government and\nwhere their money is being spent. He, like his predecessor, has pointed out that if the government don\u2019t\ndo anything to help the universities, then the money would have to come from the students themselves,\nalthough he does disagree with the number going to \u00a310,500 as suggested by Sir Richard Sykes.\nThe one other method that he does hint at, however, is one similar to that that is employed in the US.\nInterestingly, Sir Richard Sykes mentioned a similar thing to the BBC back in 2002 where he told them\n\u201cIf, for example, the fee were set at \u00a310,500 ... then \u00a316.9m would be generated if 30% of students paid\nfull fees and 70% received bursaries.\u201d It was an early indication that there stood the possibility of Imperial having a bursary scheme to aid the incredibly gifted student, something that the current Rector also\nseems to favour.\nIf a change to top-up fees were to go ahead, there is one main obstacle that the university would have\nto overcome, that being a policy that was made by Imperial College Union back in 2006 where it stated\nthat it would \u201cactively campaign against any attempt to lift the cap on top-up fees\u201d. With the government review of top-up fees around the corner and the Union policy on top-up fees expiring October\nof this year, it will be interesting to see what the outcome will be, especially with the current economic\nsituation.\nHigher Education funding and Top-up fees\nfelix\nWe\u2019ve deviated a bit here. The top-up review is coming up, what are your views on top-up fees?\nRector\nIt\u2019s a very fine balance. Personal views, I would like to see them go up and particularly because it is\nmy task to protect Imperial College through this tough time and coming out of the recession. How do\nwe survive? It depends so much on government funding and I think the imbalance between what it\ncosts to train a home-grown student and what the government gives in support to its universities is\nproblematic, so I see no other solution apart for it to rise. I\u2019m not in the debate of it rising to a terrible\nmarket force level that would be double digit thousands, but if it did rise, Imperial has to find a way of\ncreating these endowment funds that would create scholarships. These would support students from\nless advantaged backgrounds and it would mean that we could choose people purely on ability and\nnot on their ability to pay.\nI started life at a Grammar school so I was very privileged in my generation; we got County Council\ngrants if you did well at school and got certain grades to go to university, so I\u2019m a deep believer in the\nvalue of education for all independent of whether or not they could pay.\nfelix\nDo you not think that it would be a perpetuating cycle that once they do start to go up, the trend\nwill continue?\nRector\nI don\u2019t know. If you look at places such as Harvard and Yale, they have staggering scholarships which\nsupport bright kids from all backgrounds and areas of the world, so don\u2019t always equate fee paying and\nstandards. What they both do is charge the very rich an awful lot of money to go there and they then\nuse that money to support the very bright who come from less advantaged backgrounds.\nThe government and its public funding\nfelix\nYou mentioned in your Commemoration Day speech that the huge number of international students and staff are \u2018enormously to our benefit\u2019 and that \u2018we will continue to seek them out\u2019. Will\nthere be an actual cap placed on the number of international students at Imperial?\nRector\nI can\u2019t give you an answer to that as it really depends on the economic climate. At the moment the\ncap is 60/40 in favour of UK students, since we have a duty to teach home students as we are dominantly funded by the British tax payer and therefore our objective is to train high quality scientists,\nengineers, businesspeople and physicians who are British. As long as the British students have got\nthe qualifications, we will continue to take them!\nfelix\nMany people say that because this university is run more like a business, it explains the high\nnumber of international students because they pay substantially higher fees.\nRector\nWell they do because we can make a profit on them which we use to support the homegrown students because we make a loss on them normally, and that is because of the government. Of the G8\ncountries, the British government spends the second smallest fraction of its GDP on higher education and yet we have four universities in the top ten in the world. What other sector do we have such\ndominance on the international scene?\nThe amount of money the British government spend on research and development again is almost\nat the bottom, yet R&D is crucial in developing sophisticated high-tech manufacturers and industries,\nit\u2019s crucial to the solution of both socio-economic and technology problems. We have always over\nperformed, but yet we do that on a smaller amount of money than most other economies and if we\nare to remain in the top two of these in the world, the government needs to support.\nfelix\nWhere do you think that money should come from?\nRector\nLet\u2019s just say that there are three or four areas of government expenditure where a lot of money\ncould be saved. If I were to ask you what were the top five areas of R&D in the world what would\nyou say?\nfelix\nWell we would guess defence. Then followed by possibly medical. What about automotive?\nRector\nIt was, but now they\u2019ve cut back. Well there is a lot of spending in certain areas where it is not immediately clear that it is what the world needs at the current point in time. What we need are some\ntechnological solutions to some really urgent problems and that includes alternative sources of en-ergy, and in the interim before those arrive, we need solutions to carbon absorption.\nI\u2019m deeply cynical about agreements that are made: politicians and diplomats can talk as much as\nthey like about agreements like the Kyoto one and how X amount of emissions will be decreased\nby year Y, but those are meaningless unless we have the technological solutions to those problems.\nWho\u2019s going to generate those technological solutions? The new ideas come out of universities!\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say that there are three\nor four areas of government\nexpenditure where a lot of money\ncould be saved!\u201d\n\u201cThe imbalance between what\nit costs to train a home-grown\nstudent and what the government\ngives in support to its universities\nis problematic\u201d\n\u201cImperial College Union will\ncontinue to fight any increase in\ntuition fees\u201d \u2013 Jenny Morgan, ICU\nPresident\n\n"

A group of people gathering in one place at short notice, doing\nsomething out of the ordinary. And if\nyou had walked down the Strand on\nFriday you would have seen the out of\nthe ordinary charge straight at you, following a man with the boom box and\npolice vans ambling behind them.\nBut ultimately, what is the point?\nWhen you first arrive to participate in\na silent disco mob the mood is bizarre.\nI knew why I was there. The girls in\nneon tracksuits knew why I was there\n(unless I\u2019ve missed a disgusting new\nfashion trend) and the police knew why\nI, the girls in the neon tracksuits and\nthe fat man in a vest prematurely discoing on his lonesome, were there. All\nof us, including a few hundred more,\nloitered waiting for 7:00pm.\nWhen the clock struck 7:00, nothing.\nEveryone still stood wandering round\nthe square waiting for something.\nSome sort of signal to start.\nIt wasn\u2019t for another 5 minutes when\na man on top of a lion rallied everyone\nto come between the barriers. The\ncrowd took little convincing and soon\npeople were leaping over barriers,\niPods and mp3s in ear, ready to throw\nsome serious (yet stealth) shapes.\nYou might think that this would be\nquite an awkward thing to participate\nin, reserved for outgoing performance\nartists. But once you\u2019re plugged in,\nyou\u2019re transported to a massive summer festival atmosphere, via Nelson\u2019s\ncolumn.\nMosh pits were formed, conga lines\ncircled the main pit, and crowd surfers leapt from the lions\u2019 columns. The\ntwo events definitely worth mentioning were when a ten year old (and yes I\ndid verbally query the whereabouts of\nhis mother) was carried in a superman\npose right to the back of the crowd,\nand a horizontally challenged fellow,\nwho quite frankly didn\u2019t leap with such\ngrace. After he got the crowd going\nto cheer him on with some passionate bare belly rubbing, the key carriers\nfailed miserably, and the sound of his\nself hitting the concrete could be heard\nfrom the back. Not to worry \u2013 he didn\u2019t\ndie, just collapsed with unsympathetic\npolice standing over him afterwards.\nRegardless, the discoing continued, climaxing with a charge on to the nation\ngallery and a group of police vans on\nthe ready to disperse the revelers.\nThe satisfaction of passers by, who\nhad no idea what was going on, was ap-parent. With this alone, it is easy to see\nwhy these flash mobs are so fun.\nObviously there are security issues\nand concerns about public order. However, with a \u201cmob\u201d of people brandishing boards with the manifestos \u201cfree\nhugs\u201d and \u201cgood times\u201d it\u2019s hard to see\nany malice.\nFlash mobs are appearing all round\nthe world. Pillow fights, silent discos,\nmass tooth brushings, zombie walks\nand water fights are taking on cities using text, email and social networking\nsites. This is essentially performance\nart, but so clearly reflects two exciting\nfactors of this generation. The ability to communicate en masse with the\nbroad social circles we have, and more\nimportantly, can rally these social circles into doing something absolutely\nmindless in the name of a good laugh.\nPersonally I\u2019m sold. Like all street art\nin this city, it can make the daily grind\nfar more interesting. And if the fat kid\nwho failed to crowd-surf dies of internal bleeding, he is a victim of stupidity\nand not of the flash mob. As long as the\ngood nature of it remains, I hope to see\nyou at the next beautiful waste of time.\nthis fine city has to offer.\nJames Mossahebi\nMass pillow fights,\nsilent discos and\nzombie walks are\ntaking on cities\nusing text, email\nand online social\nnetworking.

On\nthe daily commute, we spoon\neach other with an imposed intimacy\nwhich would be unthinkable in different circumstances. We make fleeting\neye contact, step on feet and mutter hasty apologies as we manhandle\nour way to the exit. The Tube is often\nwhere we are at our most fragile. We\nare there moments after waking-up,\nbefore the nauseating taste of undis-solved toothpaste has been swallowed.\nWe are there after a late evening spent\nin the library, before a job interview,\non the way to meet friends who we\nhaven\u2019t seen for too long, who might\nhave changed but we hope haven\u2019t.\nLuckily, many activities are available\nto distract the commuter\u2019s attention\naway from this emotionally intense\nsituation. The dismembered London\nLites and London Papers that pepper\nthe aisles are staple for the morning\ntraveller. For the more literary and\ndextrous, one handed book-reading is\nalso an option.

However you must not\nbe swayed by ideas of intellectual ex-pansion, which is no more possible on\na packed-out carriage than is physical\nexpansion. The Tube is a place to yield\nto the subconscious whims. Here, survival is the only objective.\nMorning commutes are the most\ncrucial. The music you listen to for the\nfirst hour of your day will have a drastic effect on your mood. It is best to\nselect energetic pieces without going\ninto all-out electro-breaks (when I hear\nthe relentless snare kicks from a pair of\ntinny white iPod headphones playing\nScooter\u2019s latest hit single, I cringe not\nonly for my own sake, but for the sake\nof the listener\u2019s mental state). Hip-hop\nis often a good choice, with the slow\ntempo and confident elocution of the\nmonologists setting up a mood of bold\nself-assurance and optimism. \u201cToday\u201d\nyou may think, nodding your head to\nanother sublime Dilla joint \u201cI\u2019ma fuck\nall them bitches\u201d. And for that first\nhour of your day, you just might.\nThe music of the evening commute\nis more about indulgence. For many\nweary travellers, the evening\u2019s beats act\nas a substitute for a hot bath or a cup of\ncocoa. It is a time for sumptuousness\nand warmth, a time for comfort music.\nFolk is good here; pop or electronica\noften are not. Nothing too produced\n\u2013 the evening commute\u2019s soundtrack\nneeds to be human. It needs\nto hold you to its bosom and\ntell you that perhaps tomorrow\nwon\u2019t be quite so awful.\nThe selection of music on the Underground is an endeavour strewn\nwith potholes and potential hazards,\nbut hopefully with these tips the daily\ncommute will be slightly less grue-some. Now all you have to remember\nto do is mind the doors.\nA spot of cribbage?\nEsser can\u2019t quite work it out\nTytus Murphy\n\u201cLee Reynaldo\nof Sonic Youth\nremarking on\ntime, space and\nlove\u201d\nFollowing the success of their most\nrecent album, Men\u2019s Needs, Women\u2019s\nNeeds, Whatever, the three Jarman\nbrothers who make up The Cribs are\nsurfing the wave of momentum that\ncomes with critical acclaim and teenage adoration. Not content on\nresting on their laurels, the\nJarmans have recruited\nquite possibly the most\nmelodic guitarist of all\ntime in the form of the\neternally youthful Jonny\nMarr (formerly of The\nSmiths and Modest\nMouse). This evening\nthe Wakefield trio combined with Mancunian Marr\nare rounding off a flying tour\nof more intimate venues with\nthe aim of road-testing some\nnew material to a loyal, diehard\nlegion of fans as they work on\ntheir eagerly anticipated fourth\nalbum.\nSupport from Oregon\n3-piece The Thermals provide a retrospective of The\nCribs in 2003 as they once\narrived with their ferociously\nenergetic shows onto the live\ncircuit. But the crowd in this\nvenue (Heaven being more\naccustomed to drag queens,\nfrolics and the like) are here to\nwelcome a seminal band back\ninto the medium in which they\nare most comfortable and\nmake most sense. Few venues\ncan match the compactness,\nintimacy and sweat of Heaven and this provides the perfect setting for a raucous, intense and\nexuberant gig. Opening with new track\n\u2018We were Aborted\u2019 the anthemic nature of most Cribs tracks is immediately evident. I have to say that being quite\nthe Cribs fanatic, Marr\u2019s addition had\nme worried with the worry of his presence perhaps upsetting the dynamic\nof this buoyant band. How pedantic\nmy concerns now appear as the addition of his ambient, jangly guitar parts\nprovide a delightful foundation for the\ndistinctive Jarman guitar-hook and vo-cal. From the start, it is so captivating\nto see Ryan, Gary and Jonny interact\nwith a brotherly affection that ranges\nfrom crazy love to cool aloofness. The\nopening track is followed by a trio of\nsongs that send the enthusiastic crowd\ninto frenzy: \u2018I\u2019m a Realist\u2019, \u2018Hey Scenesters\u2019 and the snarling \u2018Our Bovine\nPublic\u2019. Collective cries of \u2018You\u2019d never\nexist without being generic\u2019 are uttered\nin unison by Ryan and the 300 or so\ncrammed into this venue as everyone\nvents a little anger at pretentious \u2018scenesters\u2019 and their flaccid shenanigans.\nThis evening is all about road-testing\nthe new material and we are shown five\nnew songs. The most impressive being\n\u2018Cheat on Me\u2019 and \u2018Victims of Mass\nProduction\u2019. It is difficult to judge the\nsongs at this stage, the instrumental\nparts are as expected and are all suc-cinct, with the Marr contribution giving the rawer material a melodic edge\nthat in tandem with Ryan, Gary and\nRoss (the unsung hero of this band\nwhose relentless drumming keeps this\nbeast ticking over in true pop-punk\nspirit) creates a frantic sound.\nThe crowd are then invited to replicate the delightful hook of \u2018Another\nNumber\u2019 and they duly oblige as Gary\ndemonstrates the often overlooked\ntender and thoughtful side to this band,\n\u201cI disappear for hours, over the smallest things\u201d and in \u2018Womens Needs\u2019: \u201cIn\nthe radius of a thousand\nThe boys are back on tour. Tytus Murphy heads to Heaven\nto witness the new Cribs lineup and some new Cribs tunes.\nmiles, I find it strange, no one makes\nme smile\u201d, capturing moments of isolation in a dramatic contrast to the anger\nof \u2018Mirror Kisses\u2019 \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed\nto say, that you\u2019re better!\u201d\nVery few bands can pull out a couplet back-to-back as powerful as \u2018Mirror Kisses\u2019 and \u2018Mens Needs\u2019 with both\nsongs being strong candidates for the\nmost anthemic reflections of adolescence since the turn of the millennium.\nAt this stage of the gig, I am pogo-ing\nwith the jubilant jerks of someone who\nis defying his twenty years of existence.\nThis band encapsulates youth in such a\npowerful way and in the live setting the\nenergy and feeling is immense. \u2018Be Safe\u2019\nis giving an epic airing with an intriguing spoken-word section provided by\nLee Reynaldo of Sonic Youth remarking on time, space and love, juxtaposing amazingly with the cry of \u201cI know\na place, where you fall in love so hard,\nthat you wish you were dead\u201d.\nThe Cribs continue to deliver at their\nlive shows and the addition of Marr is\ngoing to further improve an already\nexcellent band. The set is concluded\nwith \u2018Wrong Way to Be\u2019 and a stage\ninvasion by an agile young chap who\nafter being crashed into the ground by\na security guard is consoled by a caring hand from Ryan Jarman and invited to join the band for the end of the\nset. I, for one,\nthink those\nbruises will\ndefinitely\nbe worth it.\nThis is the latest single from ex-Lady-fuzz drummer Ben Esser, released just\nas he heads off supporting the Kaiser\nChiefs on a UK arena tour. signed to\nTransgressive last year, a label which\nhas a reputation for being on the cutting edge of new musical talent, so expectations are high already.\n\u2018Work it out\u2019 has Esser showcasing\nhis trademark electro-pop with all the\nkey ingredients - electronic blips and\nbleeps, synthesised backing vocals and\nseveral accompanying remixes. It\u2019s\nthese that could see the song easily descend into indie discos, but the single\nitself has a very easy going laid back\nfeel making it quite a relaxed listen.\nStylistic elements alluding to artists like The Streets, Jack Penate, or\nJamie T can easily be found. Esser has\na habit of invoking quirky lyrics like \u201cI\nhave a habit of getting my foot stuck in\nmy mouth / You are the only person I\nknow who can get it out\u201d which make\nthe song feel a lighthearted affair. This\ndoes however leave the song feeling a\nlittle shallow, but although there\u2019s little\nthat\u2019s particularly ingenious or ground\nbreaking here, it still remains a very\nlikeable song on the whole.\nThere is a lot of potential for Esser, especially given the current love\nfor electro/indie/pop at the moment.\n\u2018Work it out\u2019 may not propel him into\nthe glaring eye of the mainstream,\nbut there is plenty of promise for the\nfuture.\nChristopher Walmsley\nEsser\nWork It Out (single)\nMerok\nHHHII\n25\nFriday 20 February 2009 felix\n\n"

I\u2019m\nimagining a dark blue or white\noutfit. Sick.\nCollar Buttons\nThe inbetweener of sick and\nshit this week is that of the collar buttons. Go 60s mod style\nand do your buttons right up\nto the top. Go one step further\nand find that classic Ben\nSherman shirt with the ever-coveted button-down collars.\nSome say geek-chic is cool,\nbut others have been telling\nme it\u2019s not.\nLady Gaga\nCould there be anything more\ntacky than a woman who\ndespite her zany exterior, has\nthe personality of a brick? Oh,\nlook at my bow in my hair!\nHaha, you\u2019re the fool, because\nits actually IS my hair! Well,\nprobably extensions, but Paris\nHilton described Lady Gaga as\na musical and fashion \u2018icon\u2019.\nShe is neither. It\u2019s also been\nreported that her infamous\nvintage sunglasses have been\nsnatched by a \u2018crazed fan\u2019. To\nthe fan, good on you. Now\nput them up on ebay for other\nmorons to buy.\nSICK\nSHIT\nImperial\u2019s own Gok Wan and Fashion Editor, Dan Wan, suggested I write\nsomething for this page (probably because he\u2019s too busy whining about\nsomething in a different section of the paper!). I realised because we\u2019re\nstudents, we\u2019re always going to be poor (any spare cash is for booze),\nand this whole economic meltdown isn\u2019t really helping us. So here\u2019s a\nrough guide of fashion necessities that can be worn for pretty much every\noccasion, and keep you looking natty: not nasty. Kate Moss has worked out\nthat you only need to wear about five different things ever, and she\nalways gets it right. This is really just for girls, because boys only\never have about five things to wear anyway. Get these right\nand you don\u2019t need to own anything else.\nUnless you\u2019re not into the idea of wearing the skin of another species, this will\nbe a brilliant investment. It has been\na consistently good look since it was\npioneered by cavemen. The best thing\nthough, is that they both keep you\nwarm in the cold and don\u2019t overheat\nyou when it\u2019s warm. Fur coats are good\nfor winter (80% of the British year is\nwinter anyway) but leather jackets are\nsuitable for the entire year, anywhere in\nthe world. Vintage shops (Beyond Retro, Absolute Vintage, Rokit, etc.) are\nthe best places to rummage through\n(and in the case of fur, it at least means\nyou aren\u2019t directly funding the killing\nof cute furry things).\nNo,youdon\u2019twantbootcut,straightleg,\nboyfriend cut, wide leg, high-waisted,\nwhatever. You want plain blue skinny\njeans. You don\u2019t want embroidery, silk\nscreen prints, weird pockets, extra belt\nloops, studded rhinestones, coloured\npiping, deliberately distressed jeans.\nYou want plain blue skinny jeans. Even\nif you\u2019re fat, you want plain blue skinny\njeans. Black and grey are also good.\nYou can get these anywhere, I\u2019m a fan\nof the Cheap Monday brand which you\ncan get at places like Urban Outfitters.\nHave you seen Lilly Allen recently in\none? She looked simply gorge and just\nwore head to toe black accented with\nred lipstick. Feel free to be as slutty as\nyou like, it will still look classy if you\nwear all black. American Apparel has a\nreally nice long-sleeved very short one\nwith a big scoop back.\nGrey Zip-up Hoody\nLayer under a leather jacket or blazer,\nthey are cosy and lazy and warm without looking like you just rolled out of\nbed. Once again, American Apparel is\nideal for basics like this.\nCardigans are just so lovely. Everyone\nwears them: boys, girls, little kids,\ngrannies and grandads. They unite\npeople of all ages with their cosy loveli-ness. Again, material is the key factor.\nYou can get some really nice cashmere\nones from vintage shops for less than\nyou\u2019d think.\nKiller Heels\nGet the most outrageous, ridiculous\nand divine pair you can. Go for bright\ncolours and space age-looking things.\nLoads of these sorts of shoes are on sale\nright now because people aren\u2019t buying\nas extravagantly as before; take advan-tage! Shoes make or break an outfit, so\nhave the fiercest shoes and the rest of\nyour outfit doesn\u2019t matter that much.\nWear it to bed on its own, wear it to\nthe pub with jeans and boots, wear it\nto a nightclub with oil slick leggings\nand heels, it\u2019s appropriate for almost\nevery occasion. Big baggy and comfy\nare best, and if you want, make it less\nfrumpy and cut the neck and sleeves\noff. American Apparel has a plethora\nof different t-shirt styles in different\ncolours.\nSexy Black Dress\nA Big Warm Cardigan\nGrey Zip Up Hoody\nKiller Heels\nPlain Boys\u2019 T-Shirt\nLeather Jacket or Fur Coat\nSkinny Blue Jeans\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n40 Friday 20 January 2009\nfelix\nSport\n41\nfelix\nFriday 20 February 2009\nLast Sunday, nine brave men from the\nImperial College Union Floorball Club\nbattled on the courts of Bath University. The inaugural Varsity Cup, involving ten teams from six universities,\nwas the first ever competition for the\nnewly formed club and they were ready\nto draw first blood.\nThe first match of the day was a\nfriendly with the Great Britain Youth\nTeam. Things started off brightly with\nour strikers quickly establishing a 2-0\nlead. The kids clawed back to draw\nlevel at 2-2, before Hocks stamped our\nauthority with a goal to make it 3-2 at\nthe end of the first half.\nHowever, things went south from\nthere when Gabriel suffered a shoulder\ndislocation from the over-enthusiastic\nplay of our youthful opponents. With a\nvital man down for that match, we lost\n3-7. An after-action review resulted in\na reshuffle of positions.\nThe team had too many forwards,\nand no one to defend. Bravely, captain\nJay, vice-captain Abiel and all-round\nmaestro Stepan volunteered to take\nup defensive duties.Skilled and dependable hockey-converts Gabriel and\nAmrik masterminded the centre, while\nnatural poachers Hocks, Ben L and\nBen G would net the goals.\nOur next match was against Bournemouth\u2019s 2nd Team and this would\ncount towards the Cup standings. After the shake-up, our defensive line\nheld strong and our opposition had\nnary a sniff of goal, with goalkeeper\nTomy caught relaxing by the keen eyed\nspectators.\nAt the other end of the court, Hocks\ndelivered with a goal smashed in from\nclose range. Half-time score 1-0. Having settled into our new roles, floods\nof goals came streaming in during the\nsecond half. Ben L, Ben G, Hocks, Amrik, Stepan and Jay all claimed goals to\nseal an emphatic 8-0 victory. What a\nway to mark the competitive debut for\nICU Floorball!\nThe second match would be tough,\nwith Warwick\u2019s 1st Team who were demolishing all opposition left right and\ncentre. Right from the starting whistle\nit was clear our opponents were a superior team that trained together far\nlonger than we did.\nImperial closed down every opening\nand denied Warwick for much of the\nfirst half. However, rapidly tiring from\nour lack of substitutes (just three compared to their seven), we eventually\nconceded and ended the half at 0-3.\nDuring the break, the team decided\nwe had nothing to lose and should\npress home the attack. With all guns\nblazing we took the game to the opposition in the second half.\nPressure from our forwards earned\nus a rare penalty which Stepan valiantly\nJay Zhongjie Chen took but was saved. Then, Hocks came\ntantalisingly close after working some\nmagic in the box. At the final whistle,\nthe score was bordering respectable,\nat 0-5.\nBuoyed by the otherwise decent results thus far, we were ready to show\nNottingham what we were made of.\nThe match was scheduled to be the\nfinal fixture of the day. However, Team\nImperial were starting to show signs\nof fatigue from the lack of said substi-tutes. Nottingham, with an abundance\nof substitutes, came at us in full swing.\nThe Notts players were far more\nphysical than we expected, but complaints to the referee fell on deaf ears.\nBy the end of the first half, Notts had\ntaken advantage of our battered bodies and crashed in 3 goals. Even so,\nthe team knew one truth - we were\nthe better team technically. \u2018Just keep\ncalm and play our game. The goals will\ncome.\u2019 We told ourselves.\nThe second half started brightly for\nus, steeled for the battering our defence proved an impenetrable wall.\nAs predicted, the goals came. One,\nthen two and with just five minutes to\nspare we scored the equaliser!\nFinal score: 3-3.\nIt wasn\u2019t the ideal result, but we took\npride in working closely as a team with\ndetermination and spirit.\nThis was the first of three legs of the\nCup and hopefully, we have shown the\nother universities that we are a force to\nbe reckoned with in the remaining legs\nto take place next month.\nTeam Imperial\u2019s 9 brave men delighted with the biggest win of the day\nW\nell, we managed to\nstrong arm Nedi\u0107\ninto providing us\nwith an excerpt of\nhis interview with\nour esteemed rector, Sir Roy Anderson. Lo and behold:\nfelix: You recently said that all\ndepartments across the university\nwill be experiencing a 5% cut in\ntheir budget. Many are worried\nthat the cut will affect clubs and\nsocieties at Imperial whilst others\nargue that this wouldn\u2019t be so\nmuch of a problem if we didn\u2019t\nhave so many. Do you think there\nis such a thing as too many clubs\nor societies?\nJack Cornish &\nMustapher Botchway\nSports Editors\nAchin-wagwith\ntherector\nRector: I can\u2019t make that judgement.\nI\u2019d have to part of student community\nI think. Though you should review it\nevery now and again, see how many\nmembers they have, what they contribute to College life. It\u2019s like any business\nenvironment where you do a cost/ben-efit assessment.\nfelix: Seeing as you were such a\nkeen rugby player when you were\na student here, who do you think\nwill win at this years Varsity?\nRector: Terribly difficult decision to\nmake. I played six years for Imperial\nCollege 1sts and we had a fixture list\nthat was much better than the medical\nhospitals. On the other hand I worked\nmost recently at St. Mary\u2019s in the biomedical field so I can make arguments\nfor both. I\u2019m looking forward to a very\ninteresting game and I\u2019m going to be\nruthless about judging the quality of\nthe rugby.\nNow, for our take on the matters\nraised...\nVarsity, sports, Clubs and Societies \u2013 where do they fit in on the\nIC agenda?\nOfficially, \u201cImperial provides world\nclass scholarship, education and research in science, engineering, management and medicine.\u201d\nSo where does sport fit in? For that\nmatter, where do all the clubs and societies fit in?\nPersonally, and I know this is the case\nfor a lot of students at Imperial, the\nextra-curricular student activities are a\nwell needed relief from the day to day\nstresses of labs, exams and lectures.\nMoreover, with job prospects as they\nare the added line in your CV noting\nyour involvement in give-a-shit soc\nmay just swing the employer your way.\nSo what am I getting at? Well there\nare two things:\nFirstly why so many clubs and\nsocieties and secondly why the\ndifference in funding between\nthem?\nIn terms of job prospects there is the\nargument that some positions of authority within the union are worth\nmore than others, even the Rector\nagreed asking for the need of a \u2018cost/\nbenefit assessment\u2019.\nAs diverse an environment Imperial\nCollege is, we do not need a society for\neach food group and we do not need six\nhockey clubs. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong,\nbut with minimal investigation it can\nbe suggested that the view of \u2018any club\ngoes\u2019 is being taken to the extreme.\nThe process could be described as\nso: \u2018Join me if you want, put twenty\nnames on a piece of paper and we are\naway\u2019. \u2018If we convince them [New Clubs\nCommittee] that what we want to do is\nworthwhile then we are away, funding\nand all. All we need now is a name!\u2019\nMy other issue that I mentioned in\npassing is that some clubs and societies valued more than others.\nMaybe I have answered this in my\nprevious paragraph \u2013 some clubs are\nmerely there because they provide a\noff an impeccable midfield move off\na scrum initiated by O\u2019Mahoney and\ncarried on by wing Joe Harris and eager beaver/flanker Nick Johnstone.\nThen the guests decided that they\ndidn\u2019t want to totally humiliate themselves and looked likely to score, too,\nbut their #7\u2019s solo effort was stopped\n20m in front of the IC try line by a\nbreathtaking tackle from Joe Brown. It\nwas obvious that this run was a one-off\nand Cardiff didn\u2019t want to push their\nluck too much so they settled on using their forwards to cross the Imperial line. After Freddie Chalke made a\ncheeky escape off the pitch with an in-jury, they finally managed to push one\nof their props over but this didn\u2019t stop\nthe hosts from getting right back into\ntheir faces.\nJoe Brown finished off another great\nbackline run on the left wing by skin-ICURFC\ncontinue\nrun of form\nbefore Varsity\nContinuing from back page\nning their replacement winger while\nreplacement centre Adam Foley (from\nCardiff) got a bit homesick. That resulted in an unbearable urge to join his\n\u201ccomrades\u201d in their try area. It was no\nsurprise then that the Exfoliator came\nup with a great individual try after\nhanding off numerous fellow Welshmen before powering over the try line\njust next to the right corner flag. Alex\nJohnstone finished the game in style\nby converting from far right to make it\n38-7 but had to acknowledge that IC\u2019s\nsuperiority in the back-three was a lot\nmore important today than just kicking balls off a tee - they can even kick\nout of hands which resulted in man of\nthe match for fullback Max Joachim\nwho didn\u2019t hesitate a second in saying\nthat the whole pack\u2019s performance was\namazing on this memorable day at Fortress Harlington.\nAll is set for a massive Varsity tie next\nweek. Who would want to miss that?\nRival\nThe\nVarsity.\nNext week.\nWatch out for comprehensive\ncoverage of the day in The Rival.\nComing soon\nphoto by ian gillett\nVarsity\n2009\nFixture List:\nEthos (from Midday)\nBadminton\nMen\u2019s 1st & 2nd team squads\nBasketball\nMen\u2019s and Women\u2019s 1st team squads\nNetball\nWomen\u2019s 1st, 2nd, 3rd & 4th team squads\nWater Polo\nMixed 1st team squads\nHarlington (from Midday)\nFootball\nMen\u2019s 1st and 2nd team squads\nHockey\nMen\u2019s and Women\u2019s 1st and 2nd team squads\nLacrosse\nMixed 1st team squads\nRugby\nMen\u2019s 2nd, 3rd & 4th team squads\nWomen\u2019s 1st team squad (Rugby 7s) squads\nRichmond Athletic Stadium (19.30)\nJPR Williams Cup\nImperial College Men\u2019s 1st XV vs Imperial Medicals Men\u2019s 1st XV\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSport\nStrength and determination is key in the scrum.

Simply on a monetary\nbasis I can tell you that per head, the\nsubsidy given by the union can range\nfrom hundreds of pounds to a measly\nfew, and it doesn\u2019t stop there.\nSome clubs go on to receive College funding as well! So why this\nfavouritism?\nWell firstly, as a long running top UK\nWorld university, having decent sports\nclubs and facilities is important for the\nreputation of the institution.\nSecondly, in recent years university\nleague tables have started to take into\naccount the sporting prowess of the in-stitution, hence the formation of Sport\nImperial whose aim is to \u201cpromote and\nenhance the performance and participation in student sport across the\nCollege in a safe environment through\nprofessionalism, relevant administrative support systems and advice\u201d\nand essentially improve facilities and\nstandards of teams.\n\n"

Worries over\nticket sales in the run up to\nthe event proved unfounded as more\nthan 300 students defied the credit\ncrunch to attend a truly spectacular\nextravaganza of multicultural talent.\nAfter an initial Flag Dance introducing the International Societies to the\naudience the night began with a carnival feel thanks to the Afro-Caribbean\nSociety\u2019s colourful dance. Next up was\nthe Malaysian Society with their creative Stomp act. Special recognition is\ndue here as they willingly took part\nwith little notice as a last minute replacement for other acts which pulled\nout with only a week to go!\nThe Belly-dancers continued to wow\nthe crowd with their hip-shaking antics\nwhilst the Imperial College Advanced\nTap Team performed a great audition\nfor the next James Bond introduction video. In their first performance\nof the night the Cypriot Society were\nwelcomed onto the stage by their huge\nfollowing of fans to perform a medley\nof dances including the Syrtos, Stamna\nand Sousta. The final act of the first\nhalf was a highly entertaining comedy\nsketch from the Arabic Society who\nshowed us just how much fun Who\nWants to Be a Millionaire, The X-Factor and Gladiators can be.\nPeter Welsby takes us through the highs (and well it was great) of the hip-shaking, tap-dancing, pride-making, Zorba-dancing night that is International Night\nThe crowd were reawakened after\nthe interval by the new pioneers of\nChinese rock, MACE, representing the\nChinese Student and Scholars Association. Super Mario, Zelda, Link, Peach\nand of course Pikachu were given a big\nfright by the mighty Godzilla in a Japanese sketch demonstrating the importance of pride and bravery. A stunning\ndisplay of martial arts was given by the\nWushu Society who impressed the audience with their powerful routine. The\nscene was then set for the return of the\ncrowd-pleasing Cypriot Society who\nperformed the ever popular Zeibekiko\nand Zorba the Greek. It was a fitting\nfinal act before the Grand Finale where\nall performers were welcomed back\nonto the stage for some final recognition from the audience.\nThe Arabic Society won the Best Act\naward as decided by the OSC to complete a clean sweep of awards following their success in the OSC Football\nWorld Cup in November last year.

As the popularity of the event in-creased, the show started to diversify\nand widen by adding dance and music\nfrom Indian and Western cultures.\nThis unique yet simple concept of\nmerging the best of both cultures and\nblending traditional acts with contemporary ones was a phenomenal success\nand in 2003, East Meets West was held\nin the Hammersmith Apollo: the first\nyear that the show had taken place in\na venue other than Imperial\u2019s Great\nHall.\nSince then, to accommodate the\never-increasing audience and mark its\nSaman Zaman gives us a quick preview into what the\nspectacular show has to offer this year\nascending acclaim, the show has taken\nplace in a number of prestigious venues\nin the heart of London, including the\nLondon Barbican, Shaftesbury Theatre\nand London Palladium. Over the years,\nthe show has also progressed to feature\nmore cultures from all over the world,\nsuch as Chinese Wu Shu, Russian Ballet and Afrogala, and the variety of acts\nhas included drama, comedy, singing,\ncatwalk, dance and live performances\nfrom special celebrity guests on the\nnight!\nFrom its humble beginnings to what\nit is today: the largest show in Imperial and the longest running student\nshow in the UK, East Meets West 2009\npromises to be even more spectacular\nand memorable.\nThis year\u2019s line-up of scintillating\nacts boasts the finest student talent\nfrom universities across London, as\nwell as the best from Imperial College\nof course!\nIn particular not to be missed are the\namazing performances by IC Funkology and also bhangra by IC\u2019s Groundshaker: runners up of The Bhangra\nShowdown. Following last year\u2019s immense success at the London Palladium, the show returns to the West\nEnd again at the Theatre Royal and the\nevening will be hosted by legendary\ncomedian and household name: Nina\nWadia of \u2018Goodness Gracious Me\u2019 and\n\u2018All About Me\u2019.\nFinally, and most importantly, we\nmust remember the core purpose of\nthis show: to raise money and awareness for the worthy causes that are the\ncharities we are proudly supporting\nthis year: Save the Children, Care Education Trust India and Africa and The\nWinnicott Foundation for neonates\n(RAG charity 2009). Last year EMW\nraised about \u00a310000 for charity and\nwith your help we are hoping to top\nthat this year!\nThe essence of the show has been in\ntranscending all barriers and uniting\npeople from all ages and backgrounds\nto celebrate the glory of every culture,\nand by staying true to this ethos, East\nMeets West continues to grow from\nstrength to strength.\nWe hope to see you all at the show\nthat it meets and even exceeds all your\nhigh expectations, see you there!\nwithout any problems thanks to the\nhard work put in by many including\nDramSoc, the OSC Exec and all our\nvolunteers who helped out.

    "content": "4 felix Friday 20 February 2009\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nMadagascar is in the middle of a standoff between current President\nMarc Ravalomanana and Andry Rajoelina, the mayor of the capitol\nAntananarivo.\nThe two are vying for political control of the island nation, which lies off\nthe coast of East Africa and is home to 20 million people. Both men have\nappeared on their television stations and traded accusations, and their supporters have made themselves heard in rallies in public places like the Mahamasina stadium and May 13 square. However some of the protests have\nturned violent ending with civilian deaths.\nThe position of Madagascar\u2019s Army is unclear at the moment, their statement reads \u201cThe army is part of those looking for a rapid solution to the\ncurrent situation\u201d but also that\nthe Army is \u201cready to fulfil its\nduties.\u201d Ripples of the standoff have already been felt in the\neconomy with South Korean\nconglomerate Daewoo saying it\nwill delay its plans to invest in a\nnew huge intensive corn plantation in south Madagascar.\nMadagascar\nThis week chief Khmer Rouge torturer Kaing Guek Eav, better known as\n\u201cDuch\u201d\n, went on trial for crimes against humanity in a specially set-up\njoint Cambodian-UN tribunal.\nSince 2006 the tribunal has had a mandate to try senior leaders and those\nresponsible for the most atrocious part of the country\u2019s history for crimes\nagainst humanity, including genocide.\nThe Khmer Rouge (Communist Party of Kampuchea) came to power after\na coup in 1975, and immediately emptied all of the cities and towns in an\nattempt to create a utopian agrarian society. In the four years until their fall\nfrom power due to the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, an estimated 1.7 million\nCambodians died due to famine, forced labour and organised violence. Although their notorious leader Pol Pot died in 1998, other senior officials have\nbeen caught in recent years and await trial.\nCambodia\nKosovo\nWhile the UN\u2019s International Court of Justice still debates the legality of\nKosovo\u2019s unilateral declaration of independence, its people were rejoicing on February 17th, Kosovo\u2019s \u201cindependence day\u201d\n.\nThousands crowded the main streets of the capital Pristina to hear Prime\nMinister Thaci\u2019s address. Despite the sceptics\u2019 warnings of renewed violence,\ndisplacement of the Serb minority, and predictions that Serbia would fall to\nextreme nationalism, none of this has happened, and the country has remained relatively at peace.\nKeeping the peace is a large NATO led force, along with the EU\u2019s largest policing force, deployed in December. So far only 54 of the UN\u2019s 192 countries\nhave recognised Kosovo, previously a province of Serbia. Serbia\u2019s President\nTadic has vowed never to recognise its lost province, and to \u201cdefend its legitimate rights by legal and diplomatic means, not force\u201d.\nMaldives\nMaldives\u2019 new president Mohammed Nasheed has decided to sell off\nlarge portions of his government\u2019s assets in order to \u201ccut back on the\ntrappings of power\u201d left over from his predecessor.\n20 years ago Nasheed was imprisoned for political activism, but in October\n2008 he won in Maldives\u2019 first ever free presidential elections, thereby ending\nthe 30-year reign of Abdul Gayoom, the man who put him in jail.\nOn the auction list are Gayoom\u2019s presidential yatch with a reserve price of\n\u00a35m, several luxury beach villas and a private cricket pitch. Being an island\nnation in the Indian Ocean, Gayoom also had the private island of Arah for\npersonal use on weekends. Nasheed estimates that maintaining the presidency used to cost the Maldives \u00a3105m a year, now it will cost under \u00a33m.\nGaelic Football cause\ndisturbance in the Union\ntwice in one week\nTwo separate incidents have been\nbrought to the attention of Imperial College Union that have involved\nmembers of the newly formed Imperial\nCollege Gaelic football society.\nThe first of these two incidents occurred at the last Athletics Club Committee [ACC] Bar Night last week\nwhere one of their members punched\na member of the Imperial College Union Rugby Football Club [ICURFC].\nIt is believed that the individual from\nICURFC, under the influence of alco-hol, went over to the area of the Football Club and picked up one of their\npints. He then proceeded to drink half\nthe pint before throwing the other half\nover his head, which landed on the\nfootballers. One of the members then\ntold the rugby player to just leave them\nalone, which resulted in both of them\n\u2018squaring up\u2019.\nThe Gaelic Sports members were sitting behind the footballers at the time,\none of their members is alleged to\nhave stood up and punched the rugby\nplayer. On the same night, there was\na separate incident involving another\nmember from the rugby club who was\napparently pushed off the stage and\nthen kicked by others on the floor.\nAs a result, the club captains of the\nrugby club, Gaelic football society and\nthe football club have all been called to\na meeting by ACC Vice-Chair Charles\nMurdoch to obtain the full story. The\nnight also saw a fire alarm that required the evacuation of the entire\nbuilding which eventually led to the\nbar night being cut short at the request\nJovan Nedi\u0107\n& Alice Rowlands\nof the management and the fire safety\nofficer. Mr Murdoch has since told felix that he \u201cfears the future of the ACC\nbar nights might be in jeopardy after\nseveral incidents over the past few bar\nnights.\u201d\nThe outcome of that particular incident is yet to be determined, meanwhile the conduct of some members\nof the Gaelic Football society in DaVinci\u2019s on Sunday evening has brought\nthe club into further disrepute: After\nreturning from a successful match,\nthe club descended upon the Union\nfor some celebratory drinks and were\nclearly under the influence of alcohol\nupon entering the bar, starting to get\nrowdy. Eyewitnesses told felix that the\ngroup quickly became quite loud and\nboisterous, climbing on tables and\nsinging songs.\nThough very drunk, most of the\ngroup were good-natured and not\nobviously threatening. However, one\nof the group became quite aggressive and appeared to be \u201clooking for a\nfight\u201d, he turned to face the rest of the\nbar, particularly a group of sportsmen\nthree tables away and began shouting\nsuch things as \u201cyou English bastards!\u201d\nand \u201cI\u2019m going to slit your throats\u201d, before turning back to his group to lead\na more sinister round of singing that\ninvolved chanting about the IRA [Irish\nRepublican Army]. A number of the\npeople in the bar found this extremely\noffensive as the IRA were responsible\nfor a number of bombings in England\nas recently as 1996 when bombs were\nexploded in the London Docklands\narea and in Manchester city centre killing 2 people and injuring many more.\nWhile joining in with the songs that\noffended at lot of the clientele in the\nbar, most of the group did not show\nthe same sort of animosity towards the\nEnglish as was displayed by the individual leading the singing. The individual then turned around to further\nantagonise the sportsmen on the other\nside of the bar, before picking up one\nof the bar stools and moving towards\nthe group of sportsmen on the other\nside of the room. The rest of the Gaelic\nfootball group encouraged him to put\nthe stool down, at which point the individual threw the stool at the floor,\nclose to another group of students trying to enjoy a quiet drink. One of the\nlegs of the stool was broken. At this\npoint the bar manager asked them to\nleave the bar.\nWhen asked about their behaviour,\none of the Gaelic Sports members was\nheard to say they \u201cnever really thought\nabout the songs and the offence they\ncould cause. They\u2019re just songs we grew\nup knowing and heard sung in the pub\nalong with many other songs.\u201d This\ncomment has since then been refuted\nby the Gaelic Football Club Captain.\nSome of the Gaelic football members\ntried to make it clear that they hadn\u2019t\nmeant to cause offense with the songs\nand saw them as a celebration of Irish\nRepublicanism rather than anything\nmore sinister or particularly offensive\nto the English. Their actions both on\nlast Wednesday and Sunday are not\nlikely to be overlooked by the Union,\nwho are currently looking into the\nevents.\nIn response to these events, the Club\nCaptain of the Gaelic Football has\nwritten a letter which can be found on\npage 12.\nImperial College becomes first university to\nrecycle 50% of its waste products\nImperial College London has set a\npowerful precedent by becoming the\nfirst university in the UK to commit\nto halving the amount of construction\nwaste sent to landfill by 2012.\nThe College has signed up to the\nWRAP (Waste & Resources Action\nProgramme) voluntary agreement\nthrough which organisations set targets to reduce landfill waste from con-struction, demolition and excavation\nwork.\nWRAP was established as a not-for-profit company in 2000 and is backed\nby UK government funding. The\n\u2018Construction Commitments: Halving Waste to Landfill\u201d project was set\nup by WRAP in October 2008 and\nImperial joins over 40 organisations\nwho have already signed up; including\nSainsburys and ASDA.\nThis commitment is made even more\nrelevant by the magnitude of new construction works at Imperial, including\nthe new Eastside halls which were recently \u201ctopped out\u201d.\nImperial is currently spending \u00a3100\nmillion a year on constructing new\nbuildings and refurbishing existing\nbuildings across the College\u2019s cam-puses. It plans to build similar recycling and reusing techniques into all\nprojects in order to meet the goal of at\nleast halving its construction waste.\nImperial is also developing guidelines for future construction projects\nthat include working with materials\nthat are renewable and long lasting,\nand designing buildings efficiently, so\nthat the amount of materials used is reduced and less waste is generated.\nSteve Howe, Director of Building\nProjects at the College, says: \u201cAs a university we recognise that we have a\nduty to our neighbours and to society\nto spend money wisely, to reduce wastage wherever we can, and to support\nGovernment and EU targets for waste\nreduction.\u201d\nDenis Murphy, Construction Safety\nManager in the Building Projects Division at the College, adds: \u201cImperial\nwants to be a leader in this field and we\nare determined to cut our carbon footprint and increase the use of recycled\nmaterials. We hope to push ourselves\nfurther and set our own targets aiming\nto reduce waste sent to landfill by up\nto 85%.\u201d\nDr Mike Watson, Head of Construction at WRAP, said: \u201cWe are pleased to\nsee Imperial College\u2019s commitment to\nthe agreement, leading the way for others in the education sector to follow.\u201d\nThe College will also reuse and recycle more furniture, fittings and fixtures,\nsuch as chairs, desks and filing cabi-nets, by identifying materials which\ncan be reused internally or offered to\noutside organisations. In addition, a\nnew general waste recycling scheme\nintroduced in 2008 has recycled over\n900 tonnes of waste such as paper and\nplastic over the last year.\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nEastside Halls construction is to\nbe opened for September 2009\n\n"

Some scientists now believe that the existence\nof telepathy and other similar phenomena has been demonstrated in experiments and the need arises to explain\nand incorporate these phenomena into\nmainstream science.\nOthers refuse to even engage in serious debate about the issue. Who is\nright?\nRupert Sheldrake studied natural\nsciences at Clare College, University\nof Cambridge and then philosophy at\nHarvard University. He did his PhD in\nbiochemistry at Cambridge, where he\nwas later a fellow of Clare College and\nDirector of Studies in biochemistry\nand cell biology.\nHis research was initially focused on\nplant molecular biology but currently\nfocuses mainly on the investigations\nof paranormal phenomena such as te-lepathy. Some of his current research\nis funded by Trinity College\u2019s PerrottWarrick Fund for the research on \u2018the\nunexplained human and animal abilities\u2019. Because of the nature of his research he receives a lot of media attention and has taken part in various TV\nand radio programs, as well as newspaper interviews.\nAlthough an established scientist\nwith degrees from some of the best\nuniversities in the world, many of his\nmainstream colleagues are not convinced by, or even interested in, his re-search. Many in the scientific community consider paranormal phenomena\nto be fraudulent fantasies, so anyone\nresearching these issues risks ridicule.\nThis is as much a philosophical issue as\nit is a scientific one.\nSheldrake believes that healthy skeptics are those who are open-minded\nand accept evidence obtained by application of the scientific method, regardless of the topic of research.\nOn the other hand, he says, dogmatic skeptics hold a priori beliefs that\nparanormal phenomena do not exist\nand so dismiss research that attempts\nto shed light on these occult taboo\nissues.\nBut should not the scientific method\nbe employed for furthering our understanding of all natural phenom-ena? Even those which we now see as\nsupernatural?\nWould not many of the technological achievements we nowadays take\nfor granted be considered paranormal\nsome 200 years ago (think airplanes,\nspace travel, mobile phones, computers and internet..)?\nTelephone and e-mail\ntelepathy\nRecently Sheldrake and his colleague\nSmart empirically tested the claims\nthat some people make about the existence of telepathy: that they often think\nabout someone just before they get a\nphone call or an e-mail from them,\nor that they can guess who is calling\nthem. The usual scientific explanation for such phenomena is that people\nthink of others often, but forget those\ninstances and remember only the instances in which that person called\nthem while they were thinking about\nthem. For this reason many scientists\ndo not believe in the existence of telep-athy. However, Sheldrake and Smart\nargue that maybe telepathy really does\noccur, but \u201cthe means by which it operates is not yet understood. Its existence\nor nonexistence is not a matter of belief but of evidence\u201d\nIn this test for e-mail telepathy, one\nperson nominated four other people,\none of whom was randomly selected to\ne-mail the nominator. The nominator\nthen sent an e-mail to the researchers\none minute prior to the nominee\u2019s email to try and guess which one of the\nfournomineeswasgoingtoe-mailhim/\nher a minute later. Basically, people had\nto guess one out of four possible people who could e-mail them within the\nnext minute. Overall the correct guess\nrate was 43%, significantly higher than\nthe 25% guess rate expected by chance\nonly. As in other studies, distance between the two people e-mailing each\nother did not seem to play a role in\nthe rate of correct guesses, but emotional relationship between the people\ndid. Similar results were obtained for\ntelephone telepathy (53% guess rate),\nwhile text message telepathy experiments are also underway.\nThe author admits that he did not\nsample the population at random: fifty\npeople who took part in the email experiment applied after reading an advert about the experiment. This means\nthat those people probably thought\nof themselves as telepathic or were at\nleast interested in telepathy in the first\nplace. However, Sheldrake did not ask\nthem if this really was the case. Instead\nhe argues that it is to be expected that\ndifferent people would have differing\ntelepathic abilities, just as vision, hearing or olfactory senses do not all work\nas well in all people. Sheldrake thinks\nthat a randomly chosen sample of people for such an experiment would not\nyield results supporting the existence\nof telepathy because many people do\nnot have a good telepathic sense.\nNevertheless, his results suggest\nthere really are individual differences in\ntelepathic abilities among people, with\nsome participants constantly scoring\nno better than if they took random\nguesses, and others constantly over-scoring. Additionally, people tended to\nguess better when the e-mailers were\npeople they knew, rather than those\nunfamiliar to them. Sheldrake concludes that future studies should focus\non people who think they are telepathic and should test their ability to detect\nthoughts of people they know rather\nthan strangers.\nAlthough this study seems at first to\nbe a good support for the case of existence of telepathy, one big issue which\nthe author focuses much of his discussion on is the fact that the people involved in the study could have cheated\nin various ways. Ways participants\ncould have cheated include receiving information from the e-mailer in\nadvance or re-setting their computer\nclocks. Given his conviction that those\npeople are a priori interested in te-lepathy, this gives them an incentive to\ncheat; yet he dismisses it as unlikely.\nThe Sixth Sense\nDue to the lack of precautions to prevent such fraud it is difficult to accept\nthe telepathy results as trustworthy.\nBut even if one did, what would this\ntell us about telepathy? Perhaps that\nit exists but does not always work. If\nit works some of the time it could still\nbe the product of natural selection, if\nindeed it is or was an adaptation during our evolutionary history. Just as\nany vision is better than none, any\ntelepathy may be better in predicting\nthe uncertain future and so help individuals in survival. Evolutionarily then,\ntelepathy may make sense. But how\ndoes it work? What is the non-verbal,\nnon-visual medium of transmission\nof thought from one brain to another?\nThe answer to this question remains\nunanswered in spite of research into\nthe issue. The obvious candidates such\nas electromagnetic radiation have been\nexcluded and Sheldrake thinks the\nmedium may be morphic fields, part\nof his theory of morphic resonance.\nThese fields are thought to extend\nfrom our brains in a similar way to that\nin which the electromagnetic field extends around the Earth. The problem\nis that there is also no firm evidence\nfor the existence of morphic fields and\nthe idea of morphic resonance as a way\nthat animals communicate has been\ndiscarded as too complicated; simpler\nmechanisms have since been found,\nand provide a better explanation (if\nwe apply the philosophical principle of\nOckham\u2019s Razor).\nAlthough no textbook on animal\nbehaviour will mention telepathy as a\nway animals can communicate, Sheldrake maintains that they do use this\nmethod. In a special supplement to\nthe Journal of Consciousness Studies\nhe presents evidence for the existence\nof yet another parapsychological phe-nomenon: the sense of being stared at,\nor the \u2018sixth sense\u2019. Although the first\ntwo papers on this issue (one of which\nwas published in Science) dismissed\nits existence, subsequent research has\nconsistently found evidence for the existence of such a sense, as people and\nanimals have scored above the level of\nchance in guessing when someone is\nstaring at them from behind, through\nbinoculars or even CCTV. There is\nsome experimental evidence for the\nexistence of telepathic abilities in animals and humans, and perhaps this is\nas far as biological research can take\nus with regard to understanding these\nphenomena. If they indeed exist, their\nbenefits to organisms could readily be\nexplained evolutionarily. But just how\nthey work may be a question of quantum physics rather than biology.\nGenius or Heretic?\nProfessor Brian Josephson, Nobel\nprize winner from the Theory of Condensed Matter Group at the Cavendish\nLaboratory, Cambridge, thinks that the\ncurrent scientific evidence for the existence of paranormal phenomena justifies further research in the area. He\nalso suggests that better understanding\nof quantum theory may ultimately explain phenomena such as telepathy. He\nbelieves that the problem with many\nmainstream scientists is that they often overlook the empirical evidence for\nResearching the paranormal\nMi\u0107o Tatalovi\u0107\nScience Editor\nRecently, I went to the cinema. A\nstream of supernatural and superhuman trailers preceded the main fea-ture, all boasting grimy urban city-scapes, and polished special effects\nthat showed photogenic people defying the laws of physics as they deflected\nstreams of bullets with nothing but determined sneers and held frightening\nmind-control battles. Franklyn, Push,\nWatchmen, even the Lesbian Vampire\nKillers\u2026 all these trailers highlighted\nthe 21st century\u2019s continuing taste for\ncinema to show us humans stepping\nbeyond the normal, into the realms of\nmayhem and mysticism and film heroes pushing themselves beyond the\nmundanity of our own normal physical\ncapabilities. In the hush that followed\nthe trailers, the audience stared at the\nscreen as one, thinking something\nalong the lines of \u2018Cool!\u2019.\nWho wouldn\u2019t like some secret powers of their own? How many times\nhave we reached uselessly for something just out of our grasp, wishing it\nwould somehow fly to our fingertips?\nLooked at someone else and wanted\nto know what they were thinking.\nDreamt of being able to know exactly\nwhat the next few months would hold.\nPsychic powers would make my life so\nmuch easier.\nNo longer would I try to second-guess every choice I make. People\nwho annoyed me would simply punch\nthemselves in the face. Eating and\ndrinking would be intensely simplified,\nespecially in those difficult morning-hangover times \u2013 why, I could simply\nlie on the sofa and let the food fly into\nmy mouth.\nIn this vein, I decided to see if there\nwas any scientific glimmer of hope\nthat psychic powers really could exist\nin the human race. By that, I mean I\nsearched online using Pubmed, Google\nand Wikipedia. As it turns out, the scientific answer was still \u2018No\u2019, although\npsychic powers were investigated seriously in the recent past by the US mili-tary. During the Cold War $20 million\nwere invested in a \u2018psychic arms race\u2019\nwith the Soviet Union. To put it more\nsimply, although no consensus at the\nThe Science of the Paranormal\ntime agreed that psychic powers ex-isted, the military were concerned\nenough about the Soviets developing\nand using psychic forces to start their\nown research and development pro-gram, Project Star Gate.\nProject Star Gate went on for 25\nyears and cost $20 million, researching invisibility, levitation, telekine-sis, walking through walls (I\u2019d love to\nwitness videos of those trials), remote\nviewing, and if men could kill goats\njust by staring at them. (Why goats?\nWell, \u2018why not\u2019, one supposes.)\nStar Gate came to nothing except a\nlot of paperwork to be revealed and\ngleefully reported by the media many\nyears later, though hope and belief\npersists in the human imagination\nthat psychic abilities are real, not just a\ndying defiant gasp of romantic mysti-cism, or are the next stage of human\nevolution. For now, though, there is\nreal, reassuring, reality. For although\npsychic powers can\u2019t be found by sci-ence, they can yet be crudely mimicked by technology.\nMind reading\nToreadamindistoknowwhataperson\nis thinking, and a thinking person generates electric nerve impulses through\ntheir brain cells. Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been used to show\nand measure these electrical changes,\ncaused by changes in ion concentrations around the cells. This is a crude\nform of mind reading \u2013 to know what\nactivity is taking place in certain areas of the brain. In 2007, Microsoft\nannounced plans to patent a form of\nEEG technology to provide more efficient feedback from people testing\ntheir new user interfaces. Yet EEG can\nonly read electrical activity from areas\nof the brain closest to the scalp, from\nthousands or millions of neurons at\na time, and even simple physical motions like scratching your head can\ncause a wave of neuronal firing, as well\nas thinking careful constructive criticism of the new Windows Vista. Thus,\ndistinguishing thoughts via EEG is still\nimpossible.\nBut there are other ways of scanning a brain. In a study published this\nmonth, researchers in Canada\u2019s largest children\u2019s rehabilitation hospital\nused infra-red light and fibre optics\nto map patterns of oxygen absorption,\nand thus mental activity, in brain tis-sue. With an impressive sounding 80%\naccuracy, the researchers were able to\ndecipher a person\u2019s spontaneous preference for one of two drinks, without\nthe subjects requiring special training\nbeforehand. Though it is doubtful that\nthis method could ever pick out individual thoughts too, it is hoped that it\ncan be used to give choice and control\nback to individuals with disabilities\nthat prevent them from communicating their desires.\nAnd finally, the complexity and scope\nof the brain may not mean it is ever\npossible to read thoughts, but could\nwe ever see them? In 2008, researchers\nat the University of California developed technology that used fMRI data\nto \u2018read\u2019 information from a person\u2019s\nvisual cortex. Previous research had\nshown that fMRI can pick out brain\nactivity associated with viewing different images, but it had only been possible to identify very distinct images\n(such as faces), from fixed categories,\nwith prior scanning and knowledge\nof brain activity. Yet this new method\nwas able to produce much more complex images without prior knowledge\nof the brain\u2019s activity.\nThe lead researcher hopes that one\nday, complex images like dreams,\nmemory and mental imagery could\nbe visualised, if the brain processes\ndreams in a way that is analogous to\nvisual stimuli. What about it? Fancy\nwatching someone else\u2019s dreams? (Ed:\nNot really, No!) It could be a whole\nnew form of cinema.\nMind control\nTabloids have recently been wetting\ntheir pants over studies that show lesser\nemotional response and recall of traumatic events if subjects are given beta\nblockers, ie. \u201clike Eternal Sunshine of\nthe Spotless Mind, innit\u201d while in the\n1950s, the CIA secretly administered\nLSD to men in fake brothels under the\nhope of investigating mind control, and\nthat they would be shamed out of telling anyone else about the funny thing\nthat happened to them in the brothel\nafter work. (Apparently, the most common result was that the dosed-up subject was convinced they would be able\nto withstand pretty much any form of\ninterrogation).\nHowever, researchers at the University of Oxford reported in January\nthat involving oneself in a \u2018visuospatial\ncognitive task\u2019 after viewing a traumatic event helped reduce the occurrence of post-traumatic flashbacks. In\nshort, it appears that performing such\ntasks in the \u20186 hour window\u2019 after seeing trauma disrupts the consolidation\nof memories. To do this, they showed\nvolunteers a highly unpleasant video,\nand then made some of them play Tetris for 10 minutes. As it turned out,\nthis \u201880s Russian puzzle game\u2026 actually helped.\nTelekinesis\nCan electrical signals from the brain be\nused to move objects without touching\nthem? Perhaps the closest that exists\nthus far are machines that again, read\nelectrical signals from the body, but\ntranslate them into motions elsewhere.\nFor example, since 2007 researchers\nat the University of Illinois have been\ndeveloping a motorised wheelchair\nthat moves when the operator thinks\nof particular words, translating electrical impulses sent to the larynx when\nthe operator thinks of particular words\nusing a sensor-laden neckband and onboard computer.\nOn a different level, Emotiv, an\nAmerican/Australian company founded by neuroscientists, electronics, and\ntechnology specialists, have designed\ntechnology like \u2018Epoc\u2019, a \u2018neuro-headset\u2019, which uses EEG to translate neural activity into commands for video\ngames. Players can move objects, or\ninduce 30 different authentic facial\nexpressions and motions to their avatars in virtual gaming worlds. And,\nthey add, which can also be used to\ndirect electric wheelchairs too. One\nof the most obvious and applications\nfor mind-machine interfaces would be\nfor paralysed individuals or sufferers\nof \u2018locked in\u2019 syndrome, who are conscious but often unable to physically\ncommunicate.\nRemote sensing\nFinding where something is at a given\ntime with your mind might not be\npossible, but feeling a space without\nactually touching it is \u2013 if it\u2019s a virtual space. Literal remote sensing of\nvirtual three-dimensional objects and\nspaces is becoming possible due to the\ndevelopment of new haptic/computer\ninterfaces. These bowling-ball sized\ndevices use magnetic levitation to levitate an enclosed lightweight moving\npart \u2013 a \u2018flotor\u2019- which is controlled\nby a handle. Users move the handle\nto move the flotor, and this information is used to control the position\nand orientation of a virtual object on\na computer display. As this virtual object encounters other virtual surfaces\nand objects, corresponding signals are\ntransmitted to the flotor\u2019s electrical\ncoils, resulting in realistic tactile feedback to the user.\nResearch professor Ralph Hollis\nof the Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s\nRobotics Institute said that possible\napplications included precise micro-surgery, computer-augmented design,\nremote control of robotic vehicles\nand military drones, and even data\nvisualization.\nClairvoyance\nThis\u2019d be a useful skill to have, but\nperhaps the closest we can work with\nnow is learning more about the psychology of our decision making here\nand now. Contradicting a pair of 2002\nNobel Prize winners, researchers at the\nUniversity of Rochester state that their\nlatest study shows the human brain is\nhard-wired to allow a person to make\nthe most rational decisions possible,\nwith the available information, but\nonly when their unconscious brain\nmakes the choice. People performed\npoorly on a gambling style test when\nthey were given information beforehand and told to \u2018think\u2019 consciously\nabout risks and probabilities.\nMeanwhile, in his book Stumbling\non Happiness, Dr Gilbert of Harvard\nUniversity has pointed out that the\nhuman brain is prone to frequent mistakes when trying to imagine future\nconsequences. The pleasures of positive events are usually overestimated,\nwhile negative events are imagined\nworse than they usually are. Thinking about the future is pleasurable and\nimagining bad events is functional,\nbecause fear, worry and anxiety evoke\naction.\nFinally, researchers at the University of Rochester have boldly declared\nthat the human brain is hard-wired to\nallow a person to make the best decisions possible, with the available infor-mation. Usually, study of rational decision making focuses on the conscious\nbrain, and how it measures future possible gains, risks and feelings.\nBut this Rochester study directly\ncontradicts a pair of Nobel Prizewinners, who received the prize in 2002\nfor illustrating that humans are usually irrational decision-makers. Instead,\ntheir study suggests that people can\nand do make optimal decisions\u2014but\nonly when their unconscious brain\nmakes the choice.\n\u201cResearchers\nwere able to\ndecipher a person\u2019s\nspontaneous\npreference for one\nof two drinks\u201d\nResearchers were able to correctly guess a drink choice 4/5 times.\nAnnabel Slater\nScience Correspondent\nOFFERED $1,000,000 Prize in a\nParanormal felix special\nBy definition science cannot\nexplain reported paranormal\nevents, but this has never\ndeterred the committed believer.\nIn 2006, Bryan Farha and Gary\nSteward found that 42% of\nAmericans believe in haunted\nhouses, 41% believed in satanic\npossession and 36% in telepathy.\nThis week felix shines a bright\nlight into the dark world of the\nparanormal, as we highlight\nresearch into mind-reading\ntechniques, long distance\ntelepathic links and telekinesis.\nPrepare to test your disbeliefs\nand wonder at the millions spent\ninvestigating paranormal events.\nthe topics that are on the fringes of sci-ence, based on their dogmatic beliefs\nand narrow-mindedness. Dismissal of\nan idea without even looking at the evidence supporting that idea is not how\nopen-minded scientists should behave;\nand yet some do. Professor Josephson\u2019s\nwebsite has a link to a separate website dealing with his research into, and\nmedia treatment of, parapsychology.\nIntriguingly, there are articles that discuss exactly these issues and show how\nsome media, even journals such as\nNature, appear to deliberately mislead\ntheir readers with respect to evidence\nfor parapsychology. People like Professor Josephson insist on accepting the\npossibility of the paranormal, while\nmaintaining the rigour of the scientific\nmethod and abandoning such claims\nif they are clearly shown to be false.\nThe need for open discussion of paranormal phenomena led to a multidisciplinary conference at the University\nof Cambridge in 2000, at which many\nprominent scientists discussed ideas\nthat are regularly featured in peer-re-viewed journals such as University of\nBournemouth \u2018s European Journal of\nParapscyhology.\nScientists who are open to research\ninto parapsychology, homeopathy and\nthe like are concerned that mainstream\nscience is becoming an authoritative\napparatus which refuses to look into\nissues which have not traditionally\nbeen considered legitimate; and which\nmakes claims about such phenomena without an empirical basis. Openminded scientists think that although\nwe do not know how paranormal phenomena work, there is now ample evidence that they do work and need to be\nexplained by further research.

Is it Tesco Value Day or Valentines Day?\nLetters\nDear felix,\nAfter reading this week\u2019s edition of felix\n(13th February 2009), I was appalled by\nthe comportment and attitude of your\nDeputy Editor, in response to Henry\nMarsden\u2019s letter entitled \u2018An Outraged\nGnome\u2019. In the original complaint Henry Marsden pointed out that Kadhim\nShubber had quite blatantly taken material from an unreferenced source, in\nhis article published on 6th February.\nAlthough Mr Shubber does apologise for not including a bibliography,\nhis very quick to refute Mr Marsden\u2019s\nclaims of plagiarism.\nMr Shubber is quick to defend his\ncorner; yet seems incapable of appreciating the definitions of the words\n\u2018quote\u2019 and \u2018plagiarism\u2019. In the article he\nadmits he quoted the theory \u2018word for\nword\u2019, yet the definition of quote en-trains with it a degree of referencing or\nacknowledgement (a fact to which Mr\nShubber seems ignorant). Mr Shubber\nstates that \u2018While [he] did use the language of another author [:] it was not\n[his] intention, nor was it the result,\nthat it was represented as [his] original\nwork\u2019. I personally do not believe this a\nvalid argument, as at no point did Mr\nShubber direct people to a valid source\nand because of this the result was in\nfact that he DID represent the work as\nhis own (be it his intention or not). I\nbelieve Mr Marsden\u2019s underlying point\nwas not that Mr Kadhim should not\n\u201cRemember when\nsecret admirers\nslipped notes into\nyour homework?\nRemember the\nthrill?\u201d\nhave plagiarised HIS work, but rather\nthat the use of any authors work, without a correct reference, could lead to\npoor quality, unoriginal writing.\u2028\u2028\nAs a student paper, my understanding was that the paper should represent the students ideas and thoughts,\nwhilst retaining the ability to publish\nwholly-original, un-censored material\n(a right solely reserved for publications\nsuch as this). I find most disturbing\nthat that the Deputy Editor of such a\nprestigious student newspaper as Felix must \u2018use the language of another\nauthor\u2019 in order to create an interesting article. By Mr Shubber doing this I\nbelieve he risks harming the reputation\nof the paper.\nI think the most we can hope for\nadvancement of \u2018Gnome Theory\u2019 is\nnot damaged due to the renegade and\nA disgruntled\ngnome\nI\nf you are cynical like me, you\nwould have ferociously defended your wallet from being raped\nby restaurants and chocolatiers.\nI sat on the sofa and did nothing on St. Cupid\u2019s Day.

No,\nthank you.\nAs the hours grew on the 14th, how-ever, my disappointment was not con-cealable when it became clear that my\nboyfriend had completely forgotten\nabout it. (How? HOW?)

In addition, the point of\nquoting the gnome theory of electricity\n\u2018word for word\u2019 is a joke in itself; buying\ninto the idea that it is a real scientific\ntheory. While I understand that in lab\nreports, scientific essays and papers\nwe are encouraged to \u2018direct people to\na valid source\u2019 in the case of a comment piece, it isn\u2019t appropriate to add\nfootnotes at the end of every sentence\nespecially in the case of a well known\n\u2018theory\u2019, similarly if I were to say \u201cthe\nuniverse is made of tiny little vibrating\nstrings\u201d it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to explicitly reference the source.\nI am equally disturbed, Nicholas\nThornton, that you must misrepresent\nmy article to create an \u2018interesting\u2019 let-ter. The article in question included\nonly one reference to Gnome Theory\nthat was only a sentence long.

We do hope\nyou feel compelled to read the\nback page this week about the\nteam\u2019s performance in BUCS\nChampionships and would congratulate us on proudly representing Imperial so well in this National competi-tion. I can say last weekend has been\nthe highlight of my year and to lead the\nteam from its inception last year to our\nrecent success has been a privilege and\nhonour and remains a source of personal pride to me.\nHowever I also to write this week to\naddress the other issues that felix has\nreported on, prominently attaching the\nname of our club to.\nOn Wednesday last week at ACC\nBarnight it is reported that a member\npunched a member of Rugby for \u201cpicking up one of [our] pints\u201d. This does not\neven closely resemble the whole story,\nand fails to make any mention (or even\nany investigation) of the provocation\ninvolved.\nWhat I can categorically state is that\nthe club were not involved in the incident and what is being reported are the\nactions of one individual. We can also\nsay that the rugby and football clubs are\nnot to blame either for the actions of\nindividual members. I am fully aware\nof the details of the occasion and decline to make further comment at this\nstage as the matter is currently under\nfurther discussion.\nOn a more serious note, the club\nis alleged to have been singing \u201cIRA\nsongs\u201d and being rowdy. As you\u2019ll have\ngathered we were returning from our\nChampionship weekend and had been\ncelebrating our performance in the\nbest way many sports teams see fit \u2013\nwith a lot of alcohol. Speaking for the\nclub, I can understand how our behaviour on Sunday night could have been\noffensive or even threatening and will\ntake this opportunity to apologise unequivocally to those who were offended.\nI can clarify the actions somewhat, we\nwere singing songs, not directly about\nthe IRA, but about events in Republican history which several of our club\nmembers have been directly and closely affected by.\nIt is understandable how this may\ncause offence. I would like to point\nout that although this may well have\ncaused some alienation among Imperial students this is not the official policy of the club or the GAA, nor has it\never been or will be. We are committed\nto following with dedication the ethos\nand rules that govern both Imperial\nCollege Union and the GAA, whereby\nwe are compelled to be non political\nand non sectarian.\nThe actions of some of our members brought disrepute on the club and\nmay have caused some doubt as to our\nethos, for this we apologise and would\nlike to assure the Imperial student body\nthat such actions will not be repeated\nnor tolerated by the club.\nAndrew Lavery, Gaelic Football Captain, responds to allegations\n\n"
