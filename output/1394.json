    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nFriday 1 February 2008 felix\nFilm\nWhen the apocalypse comes, film it\nPatrick Tumilty\nWith Lost producer J.J. Abrams overseeing new sci-fi blockbuster Cloverfield, should we believe the hype or\nis it just more unfulfilled promise? Felix investigates to find a pleasing lack of tropical island mysteries\nPrior to release, this movie has been\nhugely hyped, with rumours springing up all over the web. The speculation surrounding the movie is mainly\ndue to a tantalising teaser trailer, but\nhas also been fuelled by the shroud\nof secrecy that has cloaked the whole\nproduction process. Was the 10.30am\nstart and ensuing dash [my alarm clock\nfailed me again!] to Empire in Leicester\nSquare worth it? Let\u2019s find out.\nAccording to producer J.J. Abrams\nof Lost fame, the idea for Cloverfield\nwas loosely inspired by the Godzillathemed toys he noticed on a trip to\nJapan; not the most profound motivation for making a sci-fi motion picture.\nMy expectations were anything but\nsky-high as I took my seat, but having recently watched Sidney Lumet\u2019s\nbrilliant Before the Devil Knows You\u2019re\nDead and the Coen brothers\u2019 intrigu-Cloverfield \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Matt Reeves\nWriter: Drew Goddard\nCast: Lizzy Caplan\nJessica Lucas\nT. J. Miller\nMichael Stahl-David\ning No Country for Old Men, I was\nprobably more receptive than usual to\nsome standard action fare.\nThe movie begins in Rob\u2019s apart-ment, where his friends are throwing\nhim a surprise going-away party before\nhe leaves New York for Japan. The initial 20-min party sequence reveals the\ncomplicated web of relationships between the film\u2019s main characters and is\na useful counterpoint to the upcoming\naction.\nThe opening scenes are shot by Rob\u2019s\nbest friend Hud, using a hand-held\ncamera. In the midst of Rob\u2019s friends\nwishing him farewell on camera, the\nlights go out and things take a turn\nfor the worse... Everybody rushes to\nthe roof, where they are horrified to\nsee the distant destruction of several towering skyscrapers by \u201csome...\nthing.\u201d The audience hear a foreboding moan from whatever is wreaking\nthis havoc, but we are kept waiting to\nfind out more. Hud continues filming\nfor the remainder of the movie on his\ncamcorder, stating, \u201cpeople are gonna\nwanna know how it all went down.\u201d\nThe main premise of Cloverfield is\nthat a massive beast has emerged from\nthe sea near Liberty Island, beheaded\nthe Statue of Liberty and proceeded\nto destroy downtown Manhattan. Not\nuntil some way into the movie do we\nget a view of the monster and no-one\neven attempts to justify its existence\nwith some bogus science. This meant\nthe viewer could focus on the gripping\naction, rather than some contrived explanation for what had happened. The\nremainder of Cloverfield depicts Rob\net. al on a quest to save his friend Beth\nfrom her apartment, where she lies\ntrapped. The ending is both fitting &\npoignant, if somewhat depressing.\nAlthough I have heard many complaints about the jerky, disorientating\ncamera work in movies such as Transformers, I had no problems giving Cloverfield my full attention.\nThe fractured, stop-start nature of\nthe recording method really added au-thenticity, especially given that much\nof the shooting was actually carried\nout by T.J. Miller himself, the actor\nplaying Hud. It\u2019s not revolutionary, but\nit\u2019s a well-used device and I agree with\nAbrams\u2019 opinion that this is what it\nwould look like if someone was, \u201cvideotaping a spontaneous, horrific event.\u201d\nConsequently, we don\u2019t see everything that happens; we don\u2019t hear\neverything that is said. This really\nhelped keep me interested in what was\ntranspiring. If you\u2019re into action and\ncreepy-crawlies [spoiler!], this movie\nis definitely worth a watch and is anything but boring. If we\u2019re all going to die, can we at least make that home movie at last?\n\n"

    "content": "10 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nAnyone but Huckabee\nC\nompared with the crowning of His Majesty Gordon Brown last year, the\nUS presidential race has\nenthralled the media on\nboth sides of the pond. News organisations all over the world pick apart each\nintricacy, skirmish, and outright war\nprimarily because of the major crossroads before America today. Not only\nare the candidates so different in their\nideals, but major issues are coming to\na head. Global warming, terrorism,\ncreationism, gun violence, the Middle\nEast, and the state of the world\u2019s largest\neconomy have all reared their controversial and sometimes ugly faces during Bush\u2019s tenancy and require decisive\naction from a new President.\nGeorge Bush will leave with the international relations of America beyond a joke in many countries. The\n\u2018Star Wars\u2019 missile system has antagonized Russia; France and Germany fell\nfoul of his foreign policy machinations;\nGuantanamo Bay and allegations of\ntorture have stained the image of the\nUS across the world and that\u2019s without\nmentioning his cosy stances on Iraq, or\nIran, or Cuba, or Palestine, or ...\nThat is why the thing America desperately needs most is a Democratic\nPresident. Someone who will not offhand greenhouse gas emission as a\n\u2018problem for technology\u2019. Someone\nwho will work with, not against, the\nUN. Someone who will not let faith get\nin the way of reason (\u201cGod told me to\ninvade Iraq ...\u201d). Someone who represents what America was founded on\nand in its heart stands for: Unity. Tolerance. Secularism. Freedom.\nFortunately, the voters of the land of\nthe free have a choice. Both Democratic candidates would be the major image change for the US it so badly wants.\nBarack Obama, the first black presi-dent. Hillary Clinton, the first female\npresident. Both represent the diversity\nof America and its opportunities to\nall, embodying the age-old American\nDream. Both talk about stewardship\nof the environment and taking active\nmeasures against carbon emissions.\nBoth want to improve relations with\nEurope and China. Both want to start\nwithdrawing troops from Iraq. Obama,\nespecially, has a strong record of peace,\nvoting against the Iraq invasion, whilst\nClinton states that \u2018had she known\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nComment\nScorpio\nthen what we do now\u2019 she would not\nhave given her support. Obama and\nClinton also want to integrate the millions of illegal immigrant workers in\nAmerica with the communities they\nlive in and have devoted livelihoods\nto, instead of further alienation. Both\nhave the potential to bring atheists and\nChristians, liberals and conservatives,\nand business and environmentalists\ntogether who for too long have bitterly\ndivided the country.\nFacing them stands the Republicans.\nCue the Imperial March. Although, to\nbe fair, even the die-hard conservatives in the party acknowledge that\nchange is due. Both Mitt Romney and\nJohn McCain have been accused of\n\u2018left-leaning\u2019 in policy areas on social\nsecurity and immigration. Disappointingly, however, only John McCain has\nstated that environmental care is one\nof his priorities, with no mentioning\nof capping greenhouse gas emissions.\nThe remaining candidates talk only\nof \u2018energy security\u2019, i.e. \u2018less dealings\nwith Russia and Saudi Arabia so we\ndon\u2019t have to play so nice with them\u2019.\nAll mention homeland defence as the\nmain thrust to their campaigns: the\nvery same stance that got George Bush\nre-elected. Combating \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018terrorism\u2019 are common themes and, as we\nall know, it is dead easy to spot those\nwith evil intent amongst the hundreds\nwho take religion a bit too far and the\nmillions who diligently observe their\nfaith peacefully instead of lumping\nthem all into one picnic.\nA terrible state for America to be in\nis to have a female or black candidate\nlose the general election due to gender\nor racial prejudice. A Democrat loss\ndue to their inter-faction policy differences is regrettable. However, the\nworst possible scenario is to vote in the\nstaunchest right-wing Republican can-didate. The candidate with medieval\nviews on homosexuality. The candidate who most threatens the separation of Church and State in America\nthat has protected citizens of all be-liefs. The natural heir to George Bush,\nwith his foreign policy, but one step\nfurther. The creationist candidate who\nwill be in command of the education of\na nation holding on dearly to the Dover\nschool ruling.\nPlease, America, I beg of you. Do not\nlet Mike Huckabee become President.\nJames Wang\nMy invisible friend\nT\nhere are some things in\nthis world that are downright wrong. Global poverty is amongst the chief\nconcerns in this respect.\nIf the developing world were richer,\nthen they\u2019d be able to solve their own\nproblems, to prevent disease, civil wars\nand malnourishment, have productive,\nhappy lives, and contribute to everyone\u2019s well-being. Unfortunately, poverty is hardly an easy problem to solve.\nThrowing money at the problem, for\nexample, is a pretty stupid way to do\nthings. And this is my main problem\nwith Fair Trade.\nThe premise sounds simple enough,\nand it also sounds effective enough.\nOffer people a choice between giving\nimpoverished farmers a better deal,\nand pay for it, or the regular stuff\nthey were getting before, which gives\ngreedy multinationals fats wad of cash.\nIn principle, it can only help, right?\nImpoverished farmers will end up with\nmore in their pocket, no matter how\nsuccessful the scheme is. And we can\nend up with a better conscience. Everyone\u2019s happy.\nUnfortunately, not quite. How much\nMatt the Hat\nThe only Fair Trade is free trade\nextra do you pay for the privilege of\nyour cup of Fair Trade coffee, say?\n20p? Probably more. And I suppose\nyou would expect this to end up in the\npockets of the farmers. It doesn\u2019t. The\nvast majority of this premium is safely\ntucked away by the outlet you bought\nit from. They know you\u2019ll pay more\nfor it, so they charge as much extra as\nyou\u2019re willing to pay. Your average coffee farmer sees in the whereabouts of\nan extra penny or two per cup. This\nis still probably enough to give them\na decent raise in earnings. But that\u2019s\nnot the point. Fair Trade might be giving the farmers a fair deal, but it\u2019s not\ngiving us, as consumers, a fair deal. It\u2019s\nboth ripping us off for the product, and\npocketing the change we wanted to go\nto a good cause!\nThere are larger, more fundamental\nconcerns I have though, and that\u2019s the\nincompatibility with the free market.\nPoverty is an economic problem. There\nare huge underlying problems with the\nglobal economy responsible for the\npoor wages of Third World farmers.\nFair Trade will not cure this. Subsidising a farmer for the sole reason that\nthey are poor will not help anyone in\nthe long run. Subsidising leads to price\ndistortions, and price distortions will\nlead to robbing money out of someone else\u2019s pocket \u2013 let\u2019s say, for exam-ple, other Third World farmers not\non the Fair Trade scheme, whose produce doesn\u2019t sell for as much because\ndemand is being diverted elsewhere.\nPerhaps they are just bad farmers that\ndon\u2019t deserve to be on the scheme.\nMaybe not. The free market tends to\nbe a more responsive judge of who is a\ngood farmer, and what they should be\npaidaccordingtodemand(c.f.econom-ics 101) than an arbitrarily designated\ncommittee, and can handle everyone\nwithout vast swathes of bureaucracy.\nAnd farmers who rely on Fair Trade\nwill not be able to stick it out in the\nreal world. We need the economy to\ntip back in their favour. Remember the\nprinciple of how people prefer fishing\nrods to truckloads of fish? Or farming\ntools rather than handouts of corn? It\u2019s\nthe same thing.\nOne thing that can honestly help is\ncloser to home than you think. Most\nThird World countries are not able to\ncompete properly in the western world\nbecause we subsidise our own farmers.\nThat\u2019s right: our farming industry is so\nbad that we need to give it money to\nkeep going. Third World farmers are\nwilling to work for less, they pay less\nfor land, and produce similar or better quality crop. Yet our own government pays farmers to farm things that\nthe Third World could be just as good,\nprobably better at. The EU spends 45%\n(!) of its entire budget on the archaic\nCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP),\nresponsible for the infamous food\nmountains, encouraging oversupply\nand the production of food nobody\nwanted. We\u2019re burning our tax money\nand screwing ourselves as consumers\nby effectively blocking competition.\nThe competition is anyone who happens to not be wealthy enough to live\nin the EU. Yet, with Fair Trade, apparently the way to resolve the situation is\nto screw ourselves even more, and pay\nout money so that a small fraction ends\nup in their pockets.\nIt\u2019s a noble gesture, but it can only be\na short term fix. The CAP is the real\nenemy. It\u2019s unfair, and a waste of mon-ey. Let the Third World farmers trade\nfreely and fairly with us, and we can all\nhave a better standard of living.\nP\neople sometimes claim that\nthey have imaginary or invisible friends. I do in fact\nhave an invisible friend. But\nI see him almost every time\nI walk into college. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s any\ngood at hiding or is able to blend into\nthe crowd \u2013 quite the contrary. But to\nthe crowds passing every day he might\nas well be invisible.\nThe first time we both sat and sipped\nour cups of tea, I found out that my\ninvisible friend is already in at work\nbefore I wake up most days. Recently\nhe tells me that January business is going slowly because of people having\nspent all their money over Christmas.\nHe does share some pieces of good\nnews. He\u2019s managed to get a second\njob cleaning part time and has finally\ngotten a place to stay. Given his current circumstances (which have remained unchanged for five years), one\nwouldn\u2019t have thought that he was once\na teacher: English and History, neither\nof which were my strong subjects. He\nsays that he has never claimed social\nbenefit, and I believe him. I\u2019ve never\nseen him force his sales on anyone\npassing by either. Pride, he tells me. It\u2019s\nwhat he has left. Unfortunately, as he\u2019s\ngetting on in his age, he says he cannot\nkeep doing his current job. My invisible friend isn\u2019t bitter or angry over his\nsituation. Instead, he thanks me heartily for the cup of tea before I have to\nhead in to my lectures.\nSome people are born the sons and\ndaughters of monarchs. Others are\nraised orphans. I don\u2019t think it really\nmatters. It\u2019s a simple fact of life that\nsome are luckier than others. What I\ndo think matters though, is that you\nappreciate what you have. People bitch\nabout the smallest things. Some go\nthrough their entire lives without realizing how good they have it. Next time\nyour two hundred pound coat with the\ndesigner logo doesn\u2019t quite manage to\nkeep the chills out, imagine sleeping on\nthe ice cold pavement an entire night\nwith just that coat to keep you warm.\nNext time the sandwich shop runs out\nof your favourite kind of wrap, imagine\ngoing a whole day without eating. One\nthing people I know hear me say quite\noften is \u2013 it could always be worse.\nI\u2019m not trying to guilt-trip you into\ndonating to the homeless. In fact, one\nof the things that really piss me off is\nthe smug fuckers who give up insignificant amounts for the sole reason\nof inflating their own egos, then walk\naway with a smug smile. Take your paternalistic sympathy and misguided altruism and shove it. Stop being a slave\nto society, trends, and the media. Enjoy\nwhat you enjoy instead of what they tell\nyou to enjoy. If you still haven\u2019t figured\nout whom my invisible friend is then\nit\u2019s just another day for you and me in\nparadise.\n\n"

The decision to change\nthe opening hours was announced last\nFriday by the ICSM Union President\nTim Wills following a spate of incidents over the last two weeks and a\ncomplaint from a local resident.\nRecently the Reynolds Bar has seen\nwidespread damage to its facilities by\ndrunken students including a toilet\nbeing ripped from a wall, light fixtures being broken and door fittings\nbeing destroyed by students leaving\nthe premises. There has also been a\ncomplaint by a security team member of verbal abuse from an unknown\nstudent (currently under investigation\nby the ICSM Union). The decision to\nalter practices was taken following this\nlitany of incidents and was further influenced by a local resident\u2019s allegation\nof a student vomiting in their garden.\nMr Wills issued a statement to all\nmedics announcing the change in bar\npractices drawing reference to these\nincidents and urging them to \u201ctreat the\nlocal residents with respect and leave\nthe premises quickly and quietly\u201d in the\nfuture. He also pledged to increase the\nnumber of stewards on busy nights and\nrequire the presentation of students\u2019\nswipe cards for entry on Fridays.\n\u201cThis kind of behaviour, although\nperpetrated by a small minority of\nstudents, is unacceptable and I am\ncommitted to improving the situation\nfor both local residents and students,\u201d\nstated Mr Wills when questioned.\nFelix canvassed medics at the Sir\nAlexander Fleming (SAF) building following the announcement. Medical\nstudents questioned the wisdom of the\ndecision, fearing that an earlier closing\ntime would trigger a \u201cspiralling decline\u201d\nof the Reynolds bar, which already\nhas a troubled financial history. They\nalso voiced concern that the measures\nwould damage many medics\u2019 clubs and\nsocieties which on many Fridays hold\nthemed \u201cbops\u201d and other events to\nraise funds for their activities.\n\u201cNo-one can be asked to pay \u00a35 entry\nfor only two and a half hours,\u201d said one\nstudent, \u201cwe don\u2019t want to go somewhere only to have to leave at 10:30.\u201d\nAnother criticised the ICSM Union\nresponse, calling it \u201cover the top,\u201d \u201cridiculous and counterproductive.\u201d\nOur sources suggest that the Reynolds brings in under \u00a3100 of turnover\non most nights, but on Wednesdays\nand Fridays this increases to \u00a31.5k.\nHow the bar will fare with a greatly\nreduced trading period on its most\nprofitable evenings is sure to concern\nthe management and ICSMU over the\ncoming weeks.\nOut of order: one of the toilets which was damaged by students\nI\u2019ll have a jumper, two pairs\nof socks and a scarf please\nIf you went down to the Union on Monday night you were sure\nto find a surprise.

This being post WWII the location was moved to the West Side\nand gangs became the Americans\nand Puerto Ricans... yeah, cos that\u2019s\nless racist.\nThe idea became West Side Story.\nLeonard Bernstein wrote the music\nand a new kid on the block, Stephen\nSondheim, wrote the lyrics.\nThe show premiered in 1957 to\nrave reviews despite the creators\nbeing scared shitless as this type of\nshow had never been done before.\nThis is what makes it such a pivotal\nshow in the history of theatre.\nWest Side Story was almost an operatic ballet: the first to put so much\ndancing with music and to use the\ndance to move the story along. It was\nalso one of the first musicals to deal\nwith a realistic storyline rather than\nthe usual \u201clook at us, we\u2019re all happy\nas we\u2019re singing and dancing\u201d.\nThe first act ended with two dead\nbodies and the second with another-nothing was resolved at the end of\nthe play. The show went on to be a major hit, having many revivals and being\nshown all around the world.\nA film was made in 1961 starring Richard Beymer (innit, I don\u2019t know who\nhe is either) and Natalie Wood, whose\nsongs were actually sung by Marni Nixon, the woman behind the singing of\nDeborah Kerr in \u201cThe King And I\u201d and\nAudrey Hepburn in \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d.\nPlot\nGenerally if you know anything about\nRomeo and Juliet you\u2019ll get the plot. If\nyou don\u2019t, what have you been doing\nwith your life? *Sigh of despair*\nIt\u2019s about a guy and a girl who love\neach other but their love can never be\nas they are from rival gangs, so they\nhave to carry out their relationship in\nsecret.\nWhen everyone starts to realise what\nis happening they have to find a way of\nstopping everyone from killing each\nother, they\u2019re obviously not very good\nat that as Tybalt kills Mercutio and\nthen Romeo kills Tybalt in revenge.\nRomeo then runs away to avoid getting jailed for murder making Juliet\nthink he\u2019s dead so she takes a sleeping draft that makes her seem dead.\nRomeo returns to find a dead Juliet and\nkills himself, she wakes up to find him\ndead and kills herself.\nUnfortunatey this was a musical\nin the 1950s so although the original\nout of town tryout was faithful to the\nShakespeare story, but by the time it\ncame to Broadway Maria did not die\nbecause those damn stiff upperlip\n1950s Americans found death on stage\ntoo upsetting.\nSongs to look out for:\nTonight: Personally I prefer the end\nof act one quartet version. Either that\nor the Tony/Maria duet. Both are\namazing\nOfficer Krupke: Two words: Funny As.\nAmerica: I got to dance this in the\nMTSoc tour last summer so I\u2019m a bit\nbiased. . It\u2019s still a very memorable\ntune - who doesn\u2019t know bababa\nbababa ba ba ba\u2026.?\nMain Characters:\nTony: The lovestruck Romeo character\nand ex-leader of the Jets.

It inspires a fashion philosophy embracing the superficial yet\nrejecting nihilism. In taking the meaning away from fashion you can either\nbe shackled by image, or free to create\nwhat you wish.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\nThe Superficial Superstar\nA\nndy Warhol reflected the\nconsumerist, celebrity\nnature of modern society.\nSome argued that his art\nwas all surface, easily recognisable images that were essentially\nmeaningless. I believe Andy Warhol\ndelighted in taking the superficial, and\nshowing that while it\u2019s meaningless in\nitself, it has personal meaning as an element of popular culture.\nIn a way, the 20th century was a crys-tallisation of the increasing individualism of society. In the past people lived\nand worked together and the group\nmeant more than the individual. Now\npeople live in wider communities and\nmore autonomously and individual-ised. Mass production and mass media\nincreasingly tie society together. This\nnew mass age also allows you to create\nand proliferate images and ideas. It\u2019s an\nenvironment that makes it possible to\nconstruct a public persona, it gives a\nmeans to propagating your image.\nWarhol\u2019s celebrity paintings weren\u2019t\nabout the person behind the star they\nwere entirely about the surface. For\nall we really know about celebrities is\nthe persona they project to the media.\nThey are people turned into a brand\nfor public consumption. It\u2019s the myth\nthat launches them to stardom, without it they\u2019re just any other person.\nAs a child, Warhol fell in love with ce-lebrity, the world of films and stars. He\nwas a veritable movie junkie, collecting\nthe free publicity stills in a box. It was\nearly on in his life he began constructing a persona about himself, picking up\naffectations from film stars, emulating\nhis idols\u2019 gestures and personal tics.\nWarhol found his persona useful in\ncareer, it gave him notoriety but also\nanonymity. When starting out as a\ncommercial artist he took to wearing\nthe same khaki trousers and beat up\nt-shirt everyday. Even when he started\nmaking enough money to dress well,\nhe\u2019d put on his \u2018Raggedy Andy costume\u2019 when going out to meet clients.\nHe found they liked the idea of hiring a\npoor starving artist.\nHe also, of course, famously wore a\nwhite wig, drawing a veil over his real\nage. He took pains to appear as blank as\npossible, to not give any part of himself\naway. In public he talked monosyllabi-cally, using simply yes, no and \u2018I hadn\u2019t\nreally thought about it\u2019. He peppered\nhis speech with ums and uhs, managing to talk without saying much at all.\nAny criticisms of his art he publicly\nagreed with, giving nothing of his true\nfeelings away. As Warhol once said,\nit\u2019s fascinating when a person puts up\na blank front, \u201cbecause you absolutely\n[can\u2019t] tell if [he\u2019s] a genius or a retard\u201d.\nLike Kate Moss (prior to breaking\nher public silence) below the surface\nhe seemed to be a void. People could\ninterpret him as they wanted. He remained meaningless so that people\ncould only guess about the man behind\nthe mask. He seemed to put everything\na step away from himself. Even the way\nhe painted, using silk screening, was\nAndy Warhol, the superficial surface of the enigmatic Andy Warhola by Sarah Skeete\nCalvin Klein, advertpalooza\nNeat Hair\nI think we\u2019re all getting\nfairly tired of the drug-addled\nscoundrel look Pete Doherty\nhas epitomised for years.\nBoys, get out the hair pomade\nand thin-toothed combs, we\u2019re\nall going to look like we did on\nour first day of school!\nVans Shoes\nVans success in the footwear\nmarket means there\u2019s finally\nsome sort of Indie-cult rival\nto Chuck Taylors. The now\never-familiar slip-on style\nis being mimicked by other\nbrands. Does anyone else find\nthem really impractical in the\nwinter? I think I\u2019ve got frostbite\non my little toes, and due to\ntheir absolute intolerance to\neven the smallest amount of\nliquid, never mind rainfall, you\nconstantly have stupidly cold\nand wet feet?\nOnline Sales\nWhat is the point in online\nsales?

If I was looking for something to keep my\npet whale warm in, I\u2019d buy it.\nAlas, unless you\u2019re one of the\nsad people on this planet that\nsit at their computers clicking \u2018refresh\u2019 at 6AM when the\nwebsite\u2019s sale starts, you\u2019re\nnever going to get anything.\nWhat tops it all off is the fact\nthe coat you\u2019ve been drooling\nover is now out of season, and\nhas been taken off the web-site.

    "content": "comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 1 February 2008 felix\nComment\nAirports and queues\nO\nf all the witty comments I\u2019ve stolen over\nthe years and passed\noff as my own, one of\nmy favourite has to be\nthe one about national pastimes. After\nlaughing at the Labour Party, queuing\nseems to come a close second to laughing at the Conservative party as the\nEnglish national sport. The French, on\nthe other hand, seem to prefer whiling\naway the lazy summer days by going\non strike. Granted, the two activities\ndo tend to go hand in hand; especially\nat airports, where one can get as much\nexperience of both as one could possibly want.\nI\u2019ve done a fair bit of travelling, and\nhave spent more than my share of time\nat airports around the world. In fact,\nGilead Amit\nWhy is free education unrealistic?\nT\nhis week, Angry Geek\ncomes to you in a slightly\ndifferent form. Due to a\nsequence of events that I\ncan only describe as \u201cnot\nhilarious\u201d, I have injured my right arm\nand as a result am using one of these\nquite dubious speech-to-text pieces\nof software. Nevertheless, despite\nthe fact that I\u2019m having to speak this\nweek\u2019s rant into a microphone, thereby\nirritating the unfortunate sod living\nnext to me, I\u2019m going to do my best to\nmaintain the usual level of hatred and\nbile that I\u2019ve kept up quite well so far.\nThis should be quite an easy task this\nweek, though, given that this week is\nthe week that the Union staff chose to\nbring out the ridiculous debate that I\ncommented on last term.\nYes, it\u2019s that old chestnut: Should\nwe be getting our education for free\nor not? Should we instead pay for the\nprivilege of being treated like children\nover a further four years and then\ndumped into an industry that no doubt\ndoesn\u2019t want us due to impending recession that comes thanks at least in\npart, ironically, to the fact that the generations before us had their education\npaid for.\nI should probably point out before\nwe go any further that there is a slight\nbias in this week\u2019s column. You may\nfind the sensation familiar.\nA. Geek\n\u201c\nI might be a\ncynical bastard\nand the Union\nPresident might\nbe an over-politicised loon\nbut all that really\nmatters is that\nyour opinion is\nheard\n\u201d\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t think that free\neducation is \u201cunrealistic\u201d. Of course I\ndo. I think many things are unrealis-tic; for example, a contestant on Deal\nor No Deal that doesn\u2019t feel the urge to\ngamble at every opportunity she has,\na Green policy that has actually been\nthought through past the point where\nwe tear down nuclear reactors, or a\npolitician that thinks that \u201cLabour\u201d\nand \u201cConservative\u201d are not the only\ntwo ways of assessing a problem.\nSimilarly, I believe in many \u201crealistic\u201d\nthings are completely not-allowable.\nFor instance \u2013 and I do promise you\nthat I genuinely believe this \u2013 I do believe a government should be able to\nhold a terrorist suspect for as long as\nthey like. However, the idea of allowing\nany real government to do such a thing\nis verging on madness.\nSo maybe \u201crealism\u201d doesn\u2019t matter\nwhen it comes to actually fighting for\nsomething. If free education is unre-alistic, then why is it unrealistic? Do\nwe want it to be unrealistic? It seems\nto me that the whole point of political debate is not that we decide what\nis possible and not possible now, but\nthat we decide how we want society\nto be in the future. I\u2019m not saying our\nUnion President is wrong to call free\neducation unrealistic, but I do think is\nwrong to disregard the idea solely on\nthat basis. Of course it\u2019s unrealistic. So\nwas the Spice Girls comeback.\nI also disagree with the way in which\nthe free education argument is being\ndressed up as completely unreason-able. As students our initial bargaining\nposition should be exactly that \u2013 why\nshould we want free education? We\nmay feel that we have a debt to pay to\nsociety, or that we in some way owe\nsomeone something for what we have\ngained.\nHowever, I admit that considering\nthe Union, or indeed the NUS, as an\nevil, manipulative, or malicious body is\nsomewhat over the top. The truth is\nthat of course we owe someone some-thing. But just as it is reasonable for the\npublic to suspect students of stealing\nfour years of free grants and bursaries,\nit is also reasonable for us to assume\nthat universities or the government\nmay exploit us if they are allowed to\ncharge us what they wish.\nPerhaps that makes my position on\nthe free education debate \u2013 that the\nsystem that we currently have performs\nwell enough \u2013 slightly untenable, if you\nframe it in the context of me just opposing it for opposition\u2019s sake. Maybe I\njust don\u2019t understand why change is always the first thing we look for. If universities are low on money, not receiving enough funding for the number of\nstudents studying, or the government\nfeels we aren\u2019t paying enough, maybe\nthere are other causes and, more im-portantly, other solutions. Maybe we\nshould reconsider whether it was such\na good idea to lure as many students\nas we could to university in the first\nplace? Maybe we should ask ourselves\nif postmodern art on the walkway\nwalls and ridiculously-branded \u201ccentenary coffee\u201d are a better way of spending the University\u2019s money than, say,\nsomething that actually benefited the\nstudents.\nThe point is that we can split hairs all\nday, and poke holes here and there like\na production line worker at a condom\nfactory. All that matters, at the end of\nthe day, is what the majority believes.\nAnd so all I can say is this \u2013 I bloody\nwell hope that you filled in the Higher\nEducation survey. Because I might be a\ncynical bastard with nonsensical opin-ions, the Union President might be an\nover-politicised loon, the NUS might\nbe so far up their own arse that they\u2019re\nbeginning to resemble one of Esher\u2019s\nimpossible shapes; none of that actually matters. All that matters is that you\nvoice your opinion, and a majority get\nrepresented at the conference.\nWhichever side of the debate wins\nout, at least this time the student body\ncan show itself to be vaguely involved.\nI know that may sound a little unreal-istic, but I\u2019m sure you configured me to\nbelieving in it anyway.\n\u201c\nSome\npeople dislike\nqueues. Others\nget impatient\nat them. There\nalso exists a rare\nbreed whose\nhatred for them\nextends to a\nsimple refusal\nto acknowledge\ntheir existence\nLuton Airport: If we call it a line\ninstead of a queue, that reduces\nthe wait in queue time, right?\nI\u2019ve probably spent more time at airports than I have on airplanes. Most\nof it waiting around in queues. Now,\nsome people dislike queues. Others\nget impatient at them. There also exists a rare breed whose hatred for them\nextends to a simple refusal to acknowledge their existence. One of the more\nobvious traits that I inherited from my\nfather is this last quality; an indescribable gut-wrenching loathing for waiting in line.\nThis was one of the many reasons\nI had trouble understanding the distinction between hell and purgatory. I\nmean to say, what could be worse than\nan eternal waiting room full of international passengers wondering about\ntheir final destinations? The only difference between that and the Business\nClass lounge at Heathrow is that the\nseats are probably less excruciatingly\nuncomfortable. Still, as I say, my outlook has changed. Over time, I think\nI\u2019ve mellowed.\nMy consolation is that I haven\u2019t yet\nturned into the blissfully apathetic\ndrone that seems to fill queues in this\ncountry from shopping centres to bus\nstops. The reason I don\u2019t mind queuing\nso much anymore has nothing to do\nwith the English blood politely coursing through a quarter of my circulation\nsystem. The simple truth is that waiting in line gives me a chance to observe\npeople in all their glorious insanity.\nLet\u2019s face it: one queue is pretty\nmuch like another. With the exception\nof where you are, who or what you\u2019re\nwaiting for, and what the temperature\nis, all the other annoyance factors\nremain pretty much constant. For a\nqueue to really rank as a queue, for in-stance, rather than just a line, the presence of a large, balding businessman in\na buttoned-up shirt open at the neck\nand far too much jewellery is required.\nIn most cases he will be American; in\nmore exotic climes he may well be Italian or Greek. Whichever racist stereotype you care to indulge in, however,\nhe and his brothers will always behave\nin exactly the same way. Mobile phone\nin one hand, remnants of a gelling hairline being gently smoothed by the oth-er, he will make it very clear to anyone\nwithin bellowing distance that he can\npass a basic profanity test in a handful\nof languages.\nDr. Murphy, whose laws apply so well\nto these particular situations, accurately predicted that should you have one\nsuch man on your right, you will have\nanother oilier and more impatient man\non your left. Inevitably, each will notice\nthe presence of the other, and unless\nyou particularly want a spittle shower\nand a front seat at a sumo event, it is a\nwise move to silently melt away.\nAnother of the archetypical queue-mates is the single mother. Tired and\nhassled, in airport scenarios she is inevitably accompanied by a small child\nwho is either golden-haired and hyperactive or hugely depressed and eager\nto share his emotions with the world.\nIn either case, the little angel will probably spend most of the waiting time\ncleaning the floor with various parts of\ntheir anatomy ill-suited to the task.\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s me. Condescendingly looking around me as\nI mentally prepare my next column;\ndiscreetly wiping the spittle off my face\nemanating from the large man on my\nright and smiling vaguely at the hysterical cherub running circles around my\nshoes with his head. God, I love peo-ple; we\u2019re so inherently comical.\nHeathrow Airport: No holiday album is complete without one of these\n\n"

I anticipated that\nit would take care of itself but in reality invoice issuing and chasing takes\nup a considerable amount of time. In\nfact, probably the most significant difference is the amount of time I don\u2019t\nhave. I believed my manifesto was realistic when I wrote it this time last year\nbut maintaining the website along with\neverything else whilst retaining my\nsanity (or what\u2019s left of it) has turned\nout to be too tall an order.\nDo you think you\u2019ve achieved\nyour aims with Felix this year? If\nso, what were they?\nYes. I aimed to strike a balance between the styles adopted by the two\nprevious editors whilst improving the\nnewspaper on the whole and I believe\nI\u2019ve achieved that. I wanted to bring\nback some of the more light-hearted\ncontent from Rupert Neate\u2019s term two\nyears ago and to combine it with the\nless sensational and more professional\nnews style of Andy Sykes\u2019 newspaper.\nWhat has been the most important thing you have achieved so\nfar?\nI\u2019ve turned the finances from a roughly\n\u00a34k debt to a projected profit of \u00a35k\nand counting. This is despite budgeting for three issues of I,Science and\ntwo issues of Phoenix, as well as the\nweekly Felices. In case anyone anyone\nwas counting, every single issue of Felix this year has been longer than 36\npages \u2013 the largest page count we\u2019ve\nachieved in the previous two years. I\u2019m\nalso pretty pleased with the number\nof contributors we have onboard now\ntoo; Freshers\u2019 Fair was really successful\nin October and Felix should stand in\ngood stead for the years to come with\nthe crop of young talented writers we\nhave. My head isn\u2019t going to fit out of\nthe office door now is it?\nIf there was one thing you could\nchange instantly about Felix,\nwhat would it be?\nI would call it \u201cTomo\u201d and replace the cat logo with a picture of myself. No, I jest.\nI would call it Live! and\nwrite credible journal-ism. Ha. Er, ok, I\u2019d\nlove to change the\nbackend of the website so that uploading\narticles didn\u2019t take\nforever, that way\nwe could finally\nget round to going through the old\nissues of Felix and\nbuild up an archive everyone\ncan look through.\nHow do you feel Felix makes a\ndifference at Imperial?\nFelix informs, entertains, provides a\nmouthpiece for students at Imperial\nand holds people in positions of responsibility to account. If students or\nstaff feel they\u2019ve been treated unfairly\nof if they want to make their point\nknown we can be their voice. Felix encourages debate and democracy, and\nI hope students think the review sections are a bloody good read too. Most\nimportantly though, I think Felix brings\na sense of community to the College;\nwithout it, campus would definitely be\na drearier place.\nWere there any distinct low or\nhigh points as Editor?\n\u201cDistinct low point\u201d is a bit dramatic,\nbut the Wednesday all-nighters are\na real drain. I knew what I was getting myself into but it doesn\u2019t stop the\nbleeding sensation in my eyes every\nThursday afternoon after a 30+ hour\nshift.\nInvoicing and dealing with the finances is an annoyance almost on a\npar with pushing the rick-ety, smelly Union trolley\naround on Fridays to\ndeliver the newspaper.\nHowever, the latter is\nalso one of the high\npoints of being editor.\nThe warm feeling\nthat occurs in my\ntummy when\nsomeone yelps\n\u201cFriday! Felix!\nWoohoo!\u201d\nand snatches\na copy of the\nlatest issue is\nvery, er, heart-warming. Or something equally profound.\nWhat is the best\npart of being\nEditor?\nThe hookers and blow,\ndefinitely. The back\nroom is literally caked in\nwhite dust waiting for me to literally\nnosedive into once I finish this inter-view. Literally.\nRight: one of the best parts is seeing\neach glorious issue in print on a Friday\nmorning. Each issue is a challenge in\nitself: finding news, investigating sto-ries, following leads, all in time for the\nThursday deadline.\nThe other main reward is working\nwith your friends everyday. The Felix\nstaff are eager, likeminded people and\nit\u2019s my job to give them an opportunity to flex their literary muscles. I love\nthem and want at least three babies\nwith each of them.\nWhat is the most tedious part of\nbeing Editor?\nI highlighted a few issues before, but\none that really grinds my gears is the\nconstant games the Felix network enjoys playing with me. Just hours ago\nbefore I scribed these words the entire\nissue almost got deleted by my Science\neditor because of a network quirk. That\nwas a seriously uncool moment.\nIf you are not leaving Imperial at\nthe end of this year, will you be\ninvolved with Felix next year?\nI\u2019ve grown rather attached to Felix over\nthe years so I\u2019ll definitely be returning\nnext year. I\u2019ve spent most of the last\nyear and a half designing and editing\nthe newspaper rather than writing as\nmuch as I\u2019d like to, so next year I\u2019m\nplanning to write more.\nDo you see a career in journalism\nahead of you?\nYeah, I would like to go into journal-ism. I haven\u2019t pinned down which area\nyet but I\u2019m thinking along the lines of\nscience, technology or games journal-ism. Anything to save myself from being sucked into the corporate banking\nconduit which claims so many of Imperial\u2019s best and brightest.\nAre you Angry Geek?\nAt this moment in time, whilst I write\nthis at 2:26am, I might be. If you ask\nme tomorrow, I might not be. It depends on which day of the week you\nask me this question, which way the\nwind is blowing, which way the world\nis spinning and which way the water in\nyour toilet bowl is draining.\nCan you tell us who is Angry\nGeek?\nNever. If I divulge this information,\nthe Angry Geek will kill me/I will kill\nmyself.\n\n"

    "content": "26 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nThe Big Screen on a budget\nAndrew Slater and James Finnerty show readers how home-cinema can be cheap\nD\no you like watching TV?\nLike video games? Like\nfilms? If you are thinking\nyes to any of these, then\nwe\u2019ve got a bit of treat\nin store for you. The thing most of us\nsuffer from at Imperial, is not being\nable to afford some of the more expensive luxuries that exist. The world of\nbig TVs and surround-sound systems\ntends to fall into this category, but not\nnecessarily. This where we step in. We\nthought we would put together a home\ncinema on a budget and see what sort\nof results were produced.\nIf you want to buy a reasonable TV\nthese days you\u2019ll be going HD. At the\nmoments there exists two flavours of\nHigh Definition. These are 720p and\n1080p, the latter is the better. If you\ndon\u2019t know what these numbers mean\nit refers to number of lines of pixels\nthat the TV can display. So the more\nlines you have the more pixels you\nhave and therefore you get a sharper\npicture. At the moment 1080p televi-sions, of a decent quality, are beyond\nthe price range of many students so we\nare going to focus on the 720p range of\ntelevisions. Now you might think why\nis high definition so important? Well\nif you\u2019re asking yourself this, then it\nmight not be. If you just use your TV\nfor watching TV, as absurd as it sounds,\nthen you won\u2019t have much need for it.\nWhere it comes into it\u2019s own is the display of cinema quality-films and PCquality gaming in your living room.\nThe next most important thing is\nnot the size of the screen but what we\ncall the contrast ratio. Decent student\nmodels now have a ratio in the range\nof 5,000:1 to 20,000:1. What this figure refers to is the luminosity of the\ndisplay\u2019s brightest colour (white) to its\ndarkest (black). The results of a low\ncontrast ratio is what you may have\nseen on a cheap computer monitors,\nareas of black appear as weird shades\nof grey.\nNow here\u2019s the killer question- How\nbig do you want? Actually, maybe that\nshould be- How big do you need? In\nW\nelcome once again\nthe Tech section.\nThis week we have\nput together a\nHome Cinema issue focusing on explaining what you\nshould look for in good equipment and\nmore importantly for us, good value\nequipment.\nNow there has been a decent\nchunk of news this week, so in this\neditorial I\u2019ve decided to run through\nsome of the forefront news and whack\nthe rest in the headlines section on the\nnext page. So lets get one with it.\nAs mentioned in previous issues, Apple is claiming sales figures of above 4\nmillion iPhones. Sounds great doesn\u2019t\nit, but not when you delve a little deep-er. AT&T, the network all American\niPhones are on, has reported it only has\n2 million iPhones on it\u2019s network and\nthe European networks ( O2 here and\nT-Mobile in Germany ) have reported\ntotals of around 700,000. There is a big\ndiscrepancy there. Some of this, how-ever, can be attributed to large stocks of\nthe phones in warehouses that haven\u2019t\nbeen sold to the public yet. This isn\u2019t\nshocking but what is, is that it is believed a significant number of these\nhave been unlocked from the \u201ccompulsory\u201d networks. It\u2019s predicted if these\nfigures continue then this could have a\nlarge impact on Apple\u2019s profits.\nOnline-auction kings eBay have announced a change of charging. The\ncost to list an item has been halved but\nthis money is made up by increasing\nthe fee if an item is sold. Basically this\njust lowers the risk if your item does\nnot sell, as it will cost you less but if it\ndoes, you will pay more or less the same\nas before. This change has sparked\ndebates about what would really improve eBay- that is improved customer\nservice to its users. Many people have\nreceived zero aid from eBay in resolving issues with sellers and buyers who,\nthrough varied means, have taken both\ncash and item.\nAlso there are rumours forming\nabout a new PS3 package with a larger\nhard disk ( 120gb to 160gb ). Sony has\nannounced that these rumours are false\nwhich is a bit of a shame as it is one of\nthe Playstation\u2019s weaker features. Also\nthis week, I noticed that there has been\na slight price drop on most Xbox 360\npackages of around \u00a310 to \u00a330. Not\na huge drop but it does improve the\nvalue of the machine and makes it very\ncompetitive against its rivals.\nAs you may be able to tell from previous reviews I\u2019m a bit of a fan of the\nAsus eeepc. Well much to my delight,\nand hopefully yours, Asus have announced a new desktop- an all-in-one\nTV PC and a PC monitor with a desktop built in. All of these devices follow\non the laptop\u2019s aims of being cheap and\nproviding fantastic functionality for\ntheir power. To add to this announce-ment, 8\u201d and 9\u201d versions of the original\nlaptop have been announced which will\nhave the long-awaited WiMax technology built in as well as a possible touchscreen model. A tiny tablet would also\nprobably sell well.\nSo with little left to ramble on about,\nI will let you get on to the main feature\nof big screens and big speakers.\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nTechnology\nTechnology Editor \u2013 James Finnerty\nJames Finnerty\nTechnology Editor\nI think this is about the most generic picture of a home-cinema I could find, self explanatory really\npractice a lot of people go for the biggest television they can afford ignoring all other factors. This never a good\nidea. If a set is low quality, the bigger\nyou make the screen the more obvious\nthe low quality will be. Go for HD TV\nand find a range with a decent contrast\nratio. Then at this point you should\ncompare the prices of different sizes to\nyour budget and strike where the two\nmeet.\nA good method for deciding the op-timum-sized TV to buy is to measure\nhow far you will sit from it. The ratio of\nscreen size to seating distance should\nbe around 1:2.5. Any bigger and the\nimage will start to overpower viewers\nand any smaller, you may struggle to\nsee everything that is going on.\nBig speakers are great but not necessarily the best choice\nAnother factor to consider when\nbuying a set is what inputs it has to\ntake. HDMI is the big buzzword right\nnow, as it is a discrete input that can\ncarry HD video and audio in a single\npackage. Also you will probably want\nto consider what legacy inputs you\nneed. You may have some old games\nconsoles laying around or even a VHS\nplayer that you still want to use and\nthese guys are not friendly with the\nnewer digital inputs. For these you will\njust need a couple of SCART sockets\nand a set of composite sockets.\nThere are two ranges of TVs that\nyou can\u2019t really go wrong with. The\nSony Bravias and Samsung Bordeauxs.\nThese are not the cheapest for their sizes but their value is represented in very\ngood contrast ratios and input options.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go through every\nmodel of television there is, just skim\nthese models to find the one you want.\nI would suggest spending around \u00a3400\n- \u00a3500 in order to get the best quality to\nvalue ratio, you can go cheaper but it\u2019s\nnot always a great idea.\nMoving onto speaker setups, the first\nthing you should decide is whether\nyou get a 2.1 setup or a lower quality\n5.1 setup for the same money. Now is\nmore less, or is less more? Personally\nI would suggest going for a better 2.1\nsetup as in the end you will be left with\nhigher quality sound and ultimately a\nbetter experience. You may see packages offering 7.1 and higher but unless\nyou\u2019re spending tens of thousands on\nyour living, these options aren\u2019t worth\ntheir price tag.\nThere is one huge mistake I\u2019ve seen\na lot of people make when they buy a\nset of speakers. You can spot it a mile\noff. When someone refers to their\nspeaker setup by its wattage then you\nknow they\u2019ve bought some crap. Its\nalmost comparable to the aforementioned buying the biggest TV possi-ble. The maximum volume of a setup\nhas nothing to do with the quality of\nthe sound produced and even worse is\nthe fact that a cheap setup has probably gone for power over quality as it\ndoes sell better. In the end you can actually spend more money on a speaker\nsetup than you do on your display, this\nis thanks to the legions of audiophiles,\nas they like to be known, who pride\nthemselves on owning equipment that\ncosts more than the house they\u2019ve put\nthem in. In the end you can get a good\nenough 2.1 speaker setup for around\n\u00a3100.\nSo now you\u2019ve decided on the actual setup that you\u2019ll be using for the\nTV and speakers, it\u2019s time to consider\nturning it into that home cinema sys-tem. There\u2019s two main avenues that you\ncan take, the \u201cMedia Centre PC\u201d or the\nconsole route. Each has their own ben-efits, so lets have a look at both before\nwe decide.\nI\u2019m currently typing this article on\nmy media-centre PC using a wireless\nkeyboard and mouse with the HDTV\nbeing my main monitor and some\nFLAC Foo-Fighters going in the back-ground. This demonstrates the main\nbenefit of having a PC-based setup and\nthat is flexibility. From here I can load\nup a game and play on the TV, listen to\nmusic with an HD visualisation, stream\nmedia off the Net or watch anything\nfrom my downloaded or DVD collec-tion. Now it\u2019s far easier to do this than\nmany think, with the ability coming\nfrom a few upgrades.\nAlmost any PC is suitable for a home\n-media PC, your current PC may be\nable to do everything right now! For\nthe media PC you need a fairly basic\nbox with a Pentium 4 3.0Ghz, 1GB\nRAM and a basic graphics card being\nplenty for multimedia functionality.\nAlternatively you can soup-up your\nbox allowing for far more functional-ity. By beefing up the RAM and adding\na TV-tuner you can turn the box into a\nSky+ style media box with timeshifting,\nrecording to hard disk and writing to\nDVD. TV-tuners are cheap now, from\n\u00a330 upwards. When paying for a TVtuner, the higher-oriced products tend\nto provide you with hardware encoding\nand a remote control. This takes the\nstress off the processor when recording\n\n"

    "content": "5\nFriday 1 February 2008 felix\nCHRIS\nLARVIN\nDEPUTY\nPRESIDENT\n(FINANCE\n&\nSERVICES)\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed most this year?\nI get to meet a huge number of students and work with some great people who are a lot of fun. Also, it\u2019s great\nto be part of large events such as the\nUnion\u2019s Freshers\u2019 Week and seeing everyone having a great time.\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed least this year?\nJuggling tasks and time management.\nIn my role there are a huge number\nof different things to get done. It\u2019s not\nhelped by people who will come to you\nand expect something to be done in an\ninstant, but in those situations you just\nneed to be able to keep your head.\nA difficult aspect to deal with is that\nthere are some people out there who\nwill go out of their way to make life difficult for you. It\u2019s (usually) nothing per-sonal, you\u2019re in a position of responsi-bility; an easy target.\nWhich qualities would you say\nare needed to carry out your job?\nTolerance is useful when dealing with\nClubs and Societies; often you will\nwant to rip your hair out. Also, a sense\nof humour is very important; you can\u2019t\nbe too serious.\nHow was being a Sabbatical different to what you expected?\nI was entering into it with an open\nmind, and did not have real expec-tations. Perhaps I didn\u2019t realise how\nmuch work there would be to do,\nwhich means it is difficult to make the\nchanges you want to see.\nHow would you like students to\nremember your term?\nThis is a difficult one;\nobviously I\u2019d like\nsee Clubs and\nSocieties much\nbetter off at the\nend of my year\nas they are the\nUnion\u2019s greatest as-set. Also, I think everyone would be happy with\na profitable and amazing\nSummer Ball.\nDo you think you\u2019ve\nachieved your aims\nthis year? If so, what\nwere they?\nYes and no. I\u2019ve spent so much time\nhaving to focus on the day-to-day jobs\nthat I have not really had a chance to\nmove forward with the tasks I\u2019d like to\nget done.\nWhat has been the most important thing you have achieved so\nfar?\nI don\u2019t think I could pin down one\nthing, though I think relations between\nthe DPFS and the Clubs and Societies\nare closer than they have been in the\npast.\nIf there was one thing you could\nchange instantly about how the\nUnion is run, what would it be?\nGet rid of Guilds. Only kidding, the\nFaculty Unions serve an important\npurpose. Probably give the DPFS the\nability to fire people out of a large\ncannon. That would be fun, and I bet\npeople would stick to the Financial\nRegulations.\nHow do you see the Union developing over the next few years?\nPart of the Union\u2019s mission statement is to the advance the\neducation of our members,\nand is being achieved\nthrough our Clubs\nand Societies. I would\nlike to see a reduction\nin bureaucracy which\nwould more time for\npersonal development\nand club officers come\naway with better skills.\nThe commercial services of the Union are going from strength to strength\nand we\u2019ve seen the Ents program\ninvigorated with a regular Radio 1 DJ\nsession twice a term which is going\nto get bigger. I\u2019d love to see successful\nevents running on a Saturday night; we\nreally should be competing with other\nLondon SUs.\nOh, and we should have a fleet of\ninflatable minibuses so when a club\ncrashes/rolls the minibus, only the occupants are damaged and not the lovely paint jobs. Lols.\nDo you think there is a problem\nwith low turnout in the Union?\nNot at all, our turnouts are above the\nnational average even though our students are typically very apathetic. However it would be good to see a larger\nmandate for Council officers who have\nrelatively important roles.\nIf you are not leaving Imperial\nat the end of this year, will you\nbe involved with the Union next\nyear?\nI will be heading back to finish my\nfinal year of my M.Sci Geology, and I\nwon\u2019t be getting involved in the Union as I think I\u2019ve neglected my degree\nenough over for the first three years.\nIf I were to become involved with the\nUnion, I think I\u2019d only make life difficult for the new Sabbs; they wouldn\u2019t\nwant me there sticking my oar in.\nDo you honestly think Sabbaticals\nmake a difference at all?\nYes. It is important to make sure that\nany organisation continues to adapt\nand evolve and each year the Sabbaticals bring new ideas, direction and the\nmotivation to make changes happen.\nHowever, they wouldn\u2019t get much done\nwithout the staff and volunteers.\nDo you feel an urge to get into\nmainstream politics?\nEven before I stood for election I knew\nI didn\u2019t have an interest in politics, and\nI still don\u2019t. It\u2019s not for me; I\u2019m happy\nwith my rocks and colouring-in maps.\nHow much money have you\nembezzled?\nWhat? Me? Don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\ntalking about. Don\u2019t even know what\nemfrazzle means.\nKIRSTY\nPATTERSON\nDEPUTY\nPRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION\n&\nWELFARE)\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed most this year?\nI\u2019ve really enjoyed ranting at the right\npeople. We all know the feeling when\nyou spend a few hours complaining\nto anyone who will listen about unfair regulations or inadequate facilities\n(probably over a pint in the Union bar).\nIt\u2019s a calming feeling but lacks the satisfaction of knowing you\u2019ll influence\nsomeone with the power to change it.\nDPEW allows you to do both!\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed least this year?\nHigh expectations from others on what\nyou can achieve by ranting at the right\npeople. Taking on board what someone tells you and saying you will try to\nsort it out can give them a real sense\nof hope. However, it is difficult to enact real change quickly or noticeably\nwhich can be quite depressing. You\nhave to have a lot of stamina to keep on\ntop of the issues.\nWhich qualities would you say\nare needed to carry out your job?\nArgumentative, opinionated, self-righteous. Not necessarily all good\nthings! You need to be able to stand\nyour ground and forget about it if you\nthink you will be shy in meetings or in-front of people getting paid a lot more\nthan you. Of course you also have to be\nready to listen and proactively encourage people to come to you with prob-lems. Negotiation skills are essential!\nHow was being a Sabbatical different to what you expected?\nThe attitude of College Staff is very\ndifferent from what you would expect.\nThey are usually really pleased if you\nspend a bit of effort finding out what\npeople think or presenting a strong\nopinion coherently. Despite people\nconstantly complaining about College\nthey don\u2019t often get to hear about it so\nare pleased when someone is honest.\nHow would you like\nstudents to remember your term?\nLike a goldfish after a\nnight on the tiles.\nDo you think you\u2019ve\nachieved your aims\nthis year? If so,\nwhat were they?\nI started\nout with\nthe first set\nof training\nfor academic and\nwelfare reps\nand have been\ndrafting a Guide for representatives\nthroughout the year. A lot of things\nthat you include in your manifesto are\nworking projects throughout the year\nand hopefully people will begin to feel\nthe benefit of them next year. So far I\nthink I\u2019m on track.\nWhat has been the most important thing you have achieved so\nfar?\nWe have been awarded Fairtrade\nUniversity Status. This was quite big\non my agenda when running for sab-batical. Also discounts for students in\nSouthside who were affected by building works and portacabins outside\ntheir windows was a big achievement.\nThere are still a lot more battles to be\nwon though.\nIf there was one thing you could\nchange instantly about how the\nUnion is run, what would it be?\nNo comment. I feel this may breach\nsome sort of protocol.\nHow do you see the\nUnion developing over\nthe next few years?\nThis could be anyone\u2019s guess. With\nsabbatical turnover\nbeing so frequent (in\nterms of other posts\nin the College) it is\ngreat to see the\nUnion constantly\nchanging. Obviously the redevelopment\nwill see a lot of\nphysical changes in the building\nand will improve\nour space. I hope to\nsee academic representation getting a\nboost in the next few years too!\nDo you think there is a problem\nwith low turnout in the Union?\nYes but this is reflected across the\nCountry in other Unions and in General Elections too. Apathy is very much\nin vogue right now. I think, with some\nstrong candidates, the elections will get\na lot more exciting and increase turn-out. Myself and the rest of the team are\nactively encouraging anyone to stand\nand get more involved in the Union.\nIf you are not leaving Imperial\nat the end of this year, will you\nbe involved with the Union next\nyear?\nI hope so. I\u2019m involved in the union\nbecause I enjoy it and because I think\nI have something to offer. I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to step on anyone\u2019s toes so any\nposition I take will be in consultation\nwith my successor. I imagine I might\ntake a more active grass roots role or\nmay drop back down to Faculty Union\nlevel. I\u2019ll try to be neutral as much as\npossible.\nDo you honestly think Sabbaticals\nmake a difference at all?\nNot as much as you might think. Or\ncertainly not within the Union. Any\ngrand plans to dig up the quad and install a Fish Pond will just be put by the\nwayside. There is simply not enough\ntime to change the world because you\nare deeply involved in the day to day\ntasks that the world would fall apart\nwithout. So yes and no really.\nDo you feel an urge to get into\nmainstream politics?\nA bit. But given that I feel an urge to\nget into law, teaching, climate research,\nmanagement in the charity sector, vol-unteer/foreign aid work, renewable\nenergy and planetary Geoscience I\nwouldn\u2019t put that down to a Sabbatical\nyear. It\u2019s part of me keeping my options\nopen or being indecisive.\n\n"

In phys-ics, alpha (\u03b1) symbolises the fine-struc-ture constant, a name which arose as it\noriginally referred to the structure of\natomic spectra \u2013 the set of electromagnetic frequencies emitted by atoms of a\nparticular element.\nHowever, alpha is much more than\nthis: it\u2019s also one of the primary physical constants that determines the nature of the universe. Alpha is essentially a 'pure' or dimensionless number,\nmeaning it does not have units, but\nrather is a ratio of the square of the\nelectron charge e with the product of\nthe speed of light c and Planck's constant \u0127. Magueijo explained how alpha\nis analogous to the well-known constant pi (\u03c0). Like alpha, pi itself does\nnot consist of units, but is also a ratio\nof two different lengths: the circumference of a circle and its diameter. What\nMagueijo and other physicists have\ndiscovered is that alpha might vary\nover time.\nExperimental evidence mentioned by\nMagueijo comes from the University\nof New South Wales, where scientists\nobserving light from distant quasars\npassing through clouds of interstellar gas, reported a variation in alpha,\noriginating from billions of years ago.\nHowever, Magueijo doesn\u2019t feel these\nrecent astronomical observations\nin themselves will lead the scientific\ncommunity to accept a varying alpha.\n\u201cNo one is ever going to believe those\nobservations until they have a table\ntop experiment.\u201d\nFurther experimental\nobservations are needed to determine if alpha varies, rather\nthan remaining\nconstant. If it\nis found that\nalpha does\nindeed vary\nthat means\none of its\nconstants\n(which include the\nspeed of\nlight) must\ngive way. A\n\u201ctable-top\u201d\nexperimental test of\nvarying alpha might be\npossible using\nusing atomic\nclocks \u2013 if alpha\ndoesvaryovertime\nsmall changes could\npotentially be detected\nover year-long experimental\ntime periods.\nSince his inaugural lecture, Magueijo has moved into his new office in\nthe theoretical physics department\nin the Huxley building and is tackling\nsome of the biggest problems in phys-ics, such as how to reconcile quantum\ntheory and gravity to get a theory of\nquantum gravity. How does he plan\nto do it? With new theories that have\na varying speed of light, a sacred constant for most physicists. Having a varying speed of light doesn't necessarily\nundermine the foundations of modern\nphysics as we know them today, but it\ndoes have fascinating consequences\nfor how we understand fundamental\nphysical laws.\nThe Varying Speed of Light (VSL)\ntheory which Magueijo is working on\nhas recently has gained a greater level\nof acceptance within the scientific\ncommunity than at its inception. It refers in fact to not one, but many similar\ntheories that claim the speed of light in\na vacuum is not always constant, but\nMagueijo doesn't discriminate \u2013 \u201cI\nwork on them all. I think it's too early\nto become attached to one, because we\nreally don't know. I mean all of them\ncould be completely wrong.\u201d While\nVSL, like inflation, has still yet to be\nconfirmed experimentally, it does provide fascinating new cosmological\ninterpretations that simply cannot be\nignored.\nVSL theory was conceived partially\nin reaction to the dominant cosmological theory of cosmic inflation which\nclaims that the universe underwent a\nphase of great expansion following the\nBig Bang. Today, astronomers cannot\nsee any further than 15 billion light\nyears \u2013 the cosmological horizon. But\nthe question remains \u2013 how did the\nuniverse expand to its massive present\nextent? Inflation provides no direct\nanswer to this question other than assuming that when the big bang 'banged'\nthe universe we live in today instantly\nexpanded from a singularity of infinite\ndensity. VSL provides an alternative\nexplanation of how the universe developed after the Big Bang. According\nto VSL theory, the speed of light was\ninitially up to 60 times faster than it is\ntoday. This means\nthat inflation is no\nlonger\nneeded be-cause, if the\nspeed of light\nat the beginning\nwas much faster, it would\nbring all regions of the universe to-gether. As the universe expanded and\ncooled over time, the speed of light\nslowed down.\nWhen Magueijo first published his\npapers on VSL theory and varying alpha the response from the scientific\ncommunity was one of \u201cbewilderment.\u201d\nMany scientists simply did not know\nwhat to think \u2013 modifying the speed of\nlight seemed like heresy if not lunacy.\nWhen the media first caught wind of\nhow Magueijo's VSL theory violated\nEinstein's special theory of relativity,\nthey called him the 'punk rocker' of\nphysics. Who would come up with\nsuch a crazy idea? Well... for starters\nEinstein himself did back in 1911 by\nclaiming gravity would slow down the\nspeed of light. Paul Dirac in 1937 found\nthat the force of gravity might also vary\nover time and was interested in developing a new\ntheory of quantum gravity\nfrom this observation. If these\ngreat scientific geniuses were\ninterested in modifying physical constants underlying modern\nphysics, why do scientists cringe at\nthe thought to- day? The answer is not a\nconvenient\none, for it has as\nmuch to\ndo with\nsociology\nas physics.\nMagueijo\ndoes not\nsee VSL as\nfrightening or \u2018antiestablishment\u2019 as television and newspapers originally portrayed it to be \u2013\n\u201cThis aura of throwing away Einstein\nwas complete nonsense, but people\ntook it that way, the interest now is\na bit more genuine, more\nscientific than what it\nused to be.\u201d\nLike many brilliant\nscientists, Magueijo is continuing where Einstein left off.\nIronically, that includes contradicting\nhis theories. \u201cMost of the things we do\nin theoretical physics is question Einstein, there's nothing special there, it's\nbasically the evolution of science, it's\nNo future for the 'punk-rocker' of physics? Hardly - Magueijo's got tenure now. But is he establishment then?\njust the way things work.\u201d Einstein of\ncourse died while attempting to reconcile his theories of relativity with quantum mechanics. He also left behind\nsome strange theoretical artifacts, including lambda (\u039b), the infamous cosmological constant. Magueijo's VSL\ntheory actually lays to rest many problematic issues surrounding the cosmological constant. \u201cAll these threatening\naspects of the cosmological constant,\nthat have created all of these problems\nin cosmology, just disappear. It's not\nso much as you get rid of it, it's just\nthat you tame it.\u201d According to VSL\ntheory, the vacuum energy increases\nif the speed of light increases as well,\nbut once the speed of light decreases,\nthis vacuum energy drops drastically.\nOnce this takes place energy from the\nvacuum then discharges into all matter and radiation in the universe. This\nallows the universe to continue to expand without the need for an 'all pervasive nothing' or cosmological constant in the equation. While this may\nseem subversive, it shows that in order\nfor science to progress it may require a\nbit of anarchy.\nAnarchy \u2013 order without government or law \u2013 is the last thing one\nwould associate with science. Science\nas an institution seems anything but\nanarchistic. However, science as a\nprocess may be more 'anything goes'\nthan what is conventionally under-stood. Magueijo was influenced by the\nanarchist philosopher of science Paul\nK. Feyerabend, a former professor at\nUniversity of London (and friend and\ncolleague of philosopher Sir Karl Popper) who was portrayed by academia\nand the media alike as the 'arch-enemy\nof science.' Yet Feyerabend may have\nactually been a pioneer in developing\na radical understanding of scientific\nmethod itself. \u201cThere is a certain element of anarchy in the scientific proc-ess, which people don't like to admit to\nand some of it is very irrational in fact,\nit\u2019s something we should admit more\nthan what we do as scientists.\u201d\nScience is often depicted as an absolutely certain and formal process of\nobtaining knowledge that is rational\nfrom the start. History books and the\nmedia alike portray scientists as gradually coming to truth by reading directly\nfrom the 'book of nature.' Magueijo\ndiscourages any absolute theoretical\ninterpretation of the physical universe,\nbut advocates an openness that has\nallowed science to progress since the\nbeginning. \u201cWe shouldn't be so serious about it, as if we know what the\nfinal answer is. We don't know what\nthe final answer is. I have no problem\nwhatsoever in working on two contradictory theories at the same time.\u201d\nAbsolute allegiance to any particular\ntheory sounds like something out of\nthe Catholic Church, not science, yet is\nit too heretical to ask if the institution\nof science is taking itself too serious-ly? In developing theories of VSL and\nvarying alpha, Magueijo is journeying\ndown a path of scientific exploration\nthat appears to be getting narrower\nand narrower: \u201cThat kind of beautiful\nopenness of 'anything going' is kind\nof disappearing more and more.\u201d Although he considers it a \u201csociological\nmisrepresentation,\u201d Magueijo has been\nbreaking down the knowledge barriers\nof theoretical physics, perhaps similar\nto the way Sex Pistols or other punk\nrock bands stretched the boundaries of\nmusic as an art form.\nAs well as work on both VSL theory\nand varying alpha at Imperial Magueijo also remains focused on quantum\ngravity and using VSL to explain the\nfluctuations in cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation left from the\nBig Bang. \u201cWe're trying to use varying speed of light theories to generate\nthe fluctuations in the universe, that's\nsomething we never did before. I also\nthink there is a role for varying speed\nof light theories of quantum gravity.\u201d\nIn the mean time, questioning physical\nlaws, at the very least, exercises one of\nthe prime movers of science \u2013 human\nintelligence.\n\n"

Fortuitously, it\u2019s\nbeen punctuated with the large\nexclamation mark that is the Devil May\nCry 4 demo.\nFor those uninitiated, Devil May Cry\nis a series of slick action games where\nthe focus is to make your own epic\neye candy. The games offer a flexible,\nmercurial repertoire of moves that one\ncan apply in whatever way imagineable\nto drive the style meter to the ever-coverted S (Stylish) or, with the last\ngame, SSS (SStylish, durr). For those\nwho like challenge, DMC has consistently offered in spades, doing away\nwith cookie-cutter enemies that stand\nback so you can feel powerful. Here,\ncomplacency is rewarded with a gory\ndeath whereas rhythmic reflexes and\nan eye for panache are juxtaposed with\ntrue gratification. DMC4 continues the\nproud trends set by the first and third\niterations (the third one was a boring,\ntame affair by DMC standards; still a\ndecent action game, mind you).\nVisually, it maintains the sombre\nGothic (in a good way, I swear) undertones in terms of character design\nand architecture. Technically, it\u2019s also a\nrather brilliant looking game, offering\ncrisp, detailed visuals and a luxuriously\nsmooth frame rate (which is quite important in the context of fast-paced action games).\nSimilarly, the gameplay itself is still\npretty damn awesome. Newcomer\nNero\u2019s arrival introduces the Devil\nBringer which allows for all manner of\ngrappling and distance-based combos\nwhereas the Exceed system gives daring players the chance to rev up (pun\nintended, as you\u2019ll see) their attack\nstrength. The game gives you a taste\nof the bosses on offer with the fiery\ndemon Berial who seems to be trying\nto give the Balrog of Morgoth a run for\nits money. He\u2019s tough, he\u2019s massive and\nbeing wreathed in flames hasn\u2019t apparently helped his temper. it\u2019s quite a fun\nbattle since you get to witness the true\npower of the Devil Bringer as you literally lay the smackdown on the fiend.\nAlso, expect to get your butt whooped\n\u2013 a lot \u2013 since the somewhat enclosed\narena means that your dodge roll abilities have to up to scratch to avoid his\nsword swipes. Pain.\nBesides that, I have the pleasure of\nannouncing another Expansion (har\nhar) to Felix Games in the form of\n\u2018TableTops\u2019. This is where we cover\nboard games. Yes, you read that cor-rectly: board games. No, this isn\u2019t\nsome tablet-top uber-geek fest, as well.\nRather, we aim to bring to attention\ncertain ones that are sophisticated in\ndesign, addicting to play and robust in\nexecution. We start off with a little gem\ncalled Ticket to Ride that\u2019s been earning a gamut of awards across the world.\nAnd with good reason, as you\u2019ll see.\nAs always, your comments, critique,\nflames, articles and credit card details\nshould find their merry way along to\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Have fun\nand don\u2019t let the dice bite.\nThis\nWeek\nPlay this when it\u2019s sunny\nTicket to Ride: Europe\nResident Evil: Redux Monkeys = brilliant (no durr)\nIt\u2019s raining... raining blood\nEduardo Vasquez-Silva unfurls his umbrella revealing an unholy armoury within\nA\ns the name implies, Umbrella Chronicles tells\nthe story behind the fall\nof Umbrella Corp. by revisiting Resident Evil 0, 1\nand 3. This game has the signature atmosphere and looks of a Resident Evil\ngame but, like RE4, it strays from the\ntraditional formula and goes for a first-person perspective \u2013 much like an\narcade light-gun game. It may sound\nshallow, but you\u2019d be surprised by the\namount of length, depth and variety\nUC has to offer.\nTo begin with, there are two control\nschemes to choose from: you can either\nuse the wiimote on its own or use Wii\nZapper settings. I personally prefer the\nlatter, where you hold the wiimote and\nZapper with your right hand and hold\nthe nunchuck with your left hand. This\nmakes the game a little more immer-sive as you feel like you are holding a\ngun and it helps you reload by shaking\nthe nunchuck instead of the wiimote,\nhelping you keep a steady aim.\nBefore you take on any mission, you\nare asked to choose a character (which\ndoes not affect gameplay at all) and\npick from a wide selection of weapons,\nwhich are unlocked by collecting them\nduring the game, so keep your eyes\nopen! These include automatic pis-tols, shotguns, machine guns, rocket\nlaunchers and magnums, among oth-ers. All the weapons in the game can\nbe upgraded by spending stars you obtain at the end of each mission, based\non your performance, which is a nice\nincentive to come back and try to improve your high scores.\nWhen it comes to actual gameplay,\nit\u2019s easy to see that UC has gone for\naction and pinpoint accuracy rather\nthan scares and quick reactions. This\nis emphasized by the fact that all enemies have a \u2018sweet spot\u2019 that will usually award you with a one shot kill.\nThis is especially gratifying when you\nsee a crimson head\u2019s\u2026 head blow up\nto pieces when rushing towards you;\nalthough, it can be frustrating at times\nwhen you keep missing (you might end\nup begging the zombies to f***ing stay\nstill).\nThe fact that you are \u2018on rails\u2019 actually adds to the sense of anxiety RE\ngames are known for, because you cannot run away and you have to kill pretty much everything you see coming towards you. Even if they catch up to you,\nthough, you usually have the chance to\ncounterattack by either shaking the\nnunchuck or quickly pressing specific\nbuttons, but these events can sometimes be a bit unforgiving.\nAs you progress, you will notice that\neven during quiet moments you are still\nmeant to shoot stuff, as lamps and furniture usually contain ammo, health or\nsecret documents that help boost your\nscore \u2013 just make sure you leave some\nlamps on though \u2013 you don\u2019t want to\nend up walking in the dark!.\nBoss battles are also present and they\nare some of the most memorable moments of the game, like jumping 50+\nmeters in the air as Wesker when fighting those weird-ass massive-shade-wearing Russian droids or wondering\nhow the hell Nemesis manages to take\nfive rockets to the face and still manage to look straight! The battles require\npattern memorisation and choosing\nthe right weapon to do the job, as long\nas you still have some ammo left in\nthem, of course.\nThe game\u2019s presentation is good. The\natmosphere is tense and the dark array\nof colours really works (it makes Mario\nGalaxy look like you are high on mushrooms\u2026 HA! geddit?) .The graphics\nmay be a bit behind RE4, but the destructible levels and the torch levels\nlater in the game really make up for it.\nThe sound effects are good, although\nthe music sometimes doesn\u2019t fit very\nwell and the dialogue can be a bit dull.\nOverall, UC really manages to do\nvery well in a seemingly restrictive\nand left-for-dead genre, with lots of\nsecrets to find, different routes and\nweapons to unlock, a 10+ hour campaign (which can be played also with a\nfriend\u2026 or your mom, whatever makes\nyou happy), while getting a feel of what\nthe story behind RE is and presenting an all-new episode. This is a game\nthat can really be enjoyed by everyone,\neven those who aren\u2019t too familiar with\nthe franchise, but RE fans will love\nthe chance of re-visiting the mansion\nand Racoon City from a thrilling new\nperspective.\nReview\nSmile for posterity now\nClearly, certain aspects were omitted from the job description\n\u201cNo honey, I swear I\u2019m not trying to kill you... honest!\u201d\n\n"

These\npeople can be seen in the gym day after day pushing out rep after rep in the\nsearch for bulging biceps, perfect pecs,\nand amazing abs. Sadly all this time\nand hard work often fails them in their\nquest to look good as they forget about\nthe importance nutrition plays in the\ngrand scheme of things.\nBeing big is not just about pumping\niron; you need to have the building\nblocks available to enlarge the muscle mass that you already have. Dan\nBenardot, author of Nutrition for Serious Athletes, puts it nicely when he\nsays \u201cthe nutritional key to building\nmuscle mass is to consume enough\nenergy to support the larger mass.\u201d In\nother words, if you are 80kg and want\nto move up to 85kg you need to eat\nas if you are 85kg. As you lift weights\nyou break your muscle fibres down, so\nif you only eat enough food for your\n80kg frame all you will do is rebuild\nwhat you have broken down and not\nincrease in size.\nIt is recommended that you consume 1.5g of protein per kilogram of\nbody weight per day if you are looking\nto increase muscle mass. Many gym\nusers will take in much more protein\nthan this in their daily diets and unfortunately more protein does not mean\nmore muscle. Any excess protein intake will either be used as energy or\nworse, stored as fat. Most of the extra\nfood that you need to consume to increase in size is for the energy needed\nto support this increase. This means\nthat your calorie intake needs to be\nhigher and it is better if you increase\ncalories through carbohydrates than\nby the extra protein that you consume.\nAs mentioned in my previous article\non carbohydrates it is recommended\nthat you consume about 65% of your\ndaily calories from carbohydrates.\nAlong with adequate protein and\ncalorie intake, the variables of your\ngym programme also play a big part\nin increased muscle mass. Research\nshows that training within a range of\n8-12 repetitions over 3-4 sets with a\nrest period of one minute will opti-mally increase muscle mass. It is also\nsuggested to perform 2-3 exercises per\nmuscle group to encourage muscle tissue break down.\nThe final component to increased\nmuscle mass is of course plenty of rest.\nIt is during our periods of rest that the\nbody rebuilds itself. Aim to allow at\nleast 48 hours rest between exercising\nthe same muscle groups and try to be\nIs bigger always better?\nin bed by 10.30pm at the latest each\nnight. The body\u2019s optimal time to repair itself physically is between 1-3am\nand to do this effectively you need to\nbe in a deep sleep which takes around\n2 \u00bd to 3 hours to achieve.\nIt is therefore advisable to avoid having a heavy workout prior to a big night\nout in the Student Union as you will\nlose any benefit you may have gained\nfrom your workout and develop a lovely beer belly!\ndefence.

Hijacking the jukebox was fun until Martin put\non Ronan Keating (Martin\nis German and so entitled to\nbad taste).\nThe Sunday, which was cold,\nwet and very windy, saw everyone wake up to Now 65 and\nGareth wake up to a hangover.\nAmid fears that the possessed\nsnowman of yesterday would\nfollow us (he became radioactive and is alive, as if you needed reminding) we cleaned up\nthe hall and, like true outdoor\nenthusiasts, sat in the caf\u00e9 in\nthe village for an hour before\nfinally heading off for the Sunday walk. Most of the group\nset off in the mini-bus for Alston for what was meant to be\na short walk along the river\nbut my initial aversion to doing a \u2018flat\u2019 walk the night before had led to the decision to\nbe dropped off several miles\nfrom Alston and to do a long\nridge walk. Chris and Nathaniel joined me as we left the\nbus and again walked up into\nthe cloud. The first words out\nof Chris\u2019 mouth were \u201coh bug-ger, I forgot to the leave the 1\nkilo rock in the bus\u201d \u2013 he is a\ngeologist and so collects these\nthings.\nNevertheless our walk was\ngood, navigation through the\nfeatureless bog-cloud scenery\nmade easier by the fact that\nwe only had to follow walls for\nmost of the way. All three of\nus fell into the marsh at some\npoint and had the pride of\nstanding in Cumbria and \u2018spraying water\u2019 into Northumberland. There was\nalso some very interesting moss (okay\nthat\u2019s my sad bit). We had guessed it\nwould take us around four hours to get\ndown into Alston and soon after the\ncloud was cleared by the biting wind\nwe could see it, a small town nestled in\nthe Pennines. A few barbed-wire fenc-es, me getting an electric shock and\nsome gate-vaulting later, we arrived in\nAlston to find the mini-bus, but no one\nelse. Like good students we went to the\npub. We did the walk in three hours.\nIt turned out, an hour later when the\nothers on the \u2018shorter\u2019 walk arrived\nthat they had got lost (on one of the\nmost well-marked long distance paths\nin Britain) and had headed up into the\nmoor in the rain. Needless to say everyone had fun and thanked us for not\nleaving them a compass, the medical\nkit or any biscuits. The drive back and\nthe pub food were great and went without incident, except that now the bus\nsmells like mud, wet, fish and chips,\nkebab and cow-dung. Can you get rising damp in a minibus? No wonder\nthey normally give us the old ones.\nThe End\nFellwanderers on top of the Pennines\n\n"

Another soloist who caught my attention\nwas Jeremy Eve, who could not only\nsing beautifully while playing the gui-tar, but also wrote his own song.\nRina Endo got the crowd going with\nher confident rendition of \u2018I Love Rock\nn\u2019 Roll\u2019, followed by Malcom Sim whose\nprofessional, all-round performance\ngot everyone\u2019s feet tappng with his version of the Kooks\u2019 \u2018She Moves In Her\nOwn Way\u2019.\nEmily May was in need of \u2018Somebody\nTo Love\u2019, but it seems she could have\nhad the pick of the audience as they\nhad clearly fallen for her. Evidently,\nEmily May is a born performer.\nDinachi Onuzo and Anita Fernando\nwere two stunning soloists who sang as\ngreat as they looked; according to the\njudges, however, their song choices let\nthem down. Needless to say, a barrage\nof booing broke out.\nBut the judges didn\u2019t always get it\nwrong. In response to Matt Rinaldi\nand Nour Fourali\u2019s Britney Spears\u2019\nmedley, judge Dr. Chris John decided\nthat \u201cthe problem with saving the children is that two of them turned out to\nbe [them],\u201d to which judge Alex Ross\nproudly added \u201cit was toxic\u201d (I think\nhe was more surprised by his own wit\nthan the audience was). Nevertheless,\nMatt and Nour provided a very enter-taining, light-hearted performance,\nwhich the audience clearly enjoyed.\nThe group \u2018Old Lady\u2019 would have\nbeen better off folding away the zim-mer, putting their feet up and watching\n\u2018Countdown\u2019 repeats. Alanis Morrissette would have been less than impressed with their version of \u2018Ironic\u2019.\nAlthough it seemed that the judges\ndidn\u2019t enjoy the performance, they\nsure as hell enjoyed hurling abuse such\nas \u201cyou probably don\u2019t deserve your\ndegrees\u201d at them. Luckily for them,\nDr Chris John won\u2019t be marking their\ndissertations.\nThis leaves us with the three prize-winning acts. The gorgeous sisters\nDehydys and Ibis Pimentel sang and\ndanced their way to third place with\ntheir performance of \u2018Heaven\u2019. While\nthis was controversial, the two managed to sell the most tickets for the\nevent, raising a great deal of money for\nSave the Children.\nIn second place was the hugely talented Waaka Moni-Nwinia, who sang\nWhitney Houston\u2019s \u2018I Have Nothing\u2019,\nmanaging to make it look effortless.\nShe would have definitely given Leona\nLewis a run for her money. Her beau-tiful, powerful voice amazed the audi-ence, leaving goose-pimples tingling\nup our arms.\nThe bluegrass band \u2018Jacob and the\nHillbillies\u2019 pizzicato-ed their way to\nsuccess with their highly entertaining\nversion of \u2018Mamma Mia\u2019. The band\nconsisted of two talented violinsists,\none of which amusingly serenaded\nthe judges, a banjo player and Jacob\nthe singer/guitarist. The whole arrangement worked extremely well,\nentertaining both the audience and the\njudges who could not fault them. The\nwinners were presented with a bottle\nof champagne and a \u00a3200 prize. However, they took everyone by surprise by\nvery generously donating the money to\nSave the Children.\nThe comp\u00e8res, Shiv Chopra and Lauren Waterman, provided the audience\nwith an endless supply of witty com-ments, kept the judges in order and\nensured seamless transitions between\nacts. Perhaps the two medics should\nconsider a change in career.\nThe evening was a great success, the\naudience loved it, the performers loved\nit, and the judges loved it. If you missed\nout, don\u2019t panic, the society is hopeful\nthat Imperial Idol will be repeated year\nafter year, so don\u2019t forget to look out\nfor next year\u2019s auditions.\nSave the Children managed to raise\nover \u00a31700 as a result of the 420 ticket\nsales, \u2018Krispy-Kreme\u2019 sales and dona-tions. The money will go straight to\nSave the Children, helping children in\nthe UK and internationally, fighting for\nchange where change is needed and\nvoicing the opinions to those not given\nthe chance to speak out.\nThe committee members have\nhigh hopes and many more possible\nprojects in the pipeline, including a\nmassive summer festival next year.

Just wait a\nsecond while we explain: Rainy\nDay is a game in which you\nbuild a tree. A tree of hands.\nHands that are holding umbrel-las. Why are they holding um-brellas, you ask? Because it\u2019s\nrainy, and otherwise the paper\nboats that are floating by on\nthe river beneath would sink.\nIt\u2019s bizarre, but charming\nenough to keep you interested.\nIt\u2019s worth playing just to get a\nsingle red boat through and\nwitness the rain of umbrellas\nand hands that follows in one\nof the most Dali-esque moments in any game, ever. A\nwonderfully surreal experience\nthat really brings out the best\nin indie gaming.\nSebastian Nordgren\nBloons\nhttp://www.ninjakiwi.com/\nbloons.html\nOK guys, stop me when this\ngame concept starts to sound\nfamiliar: you control a monkey.\nWho throws darts. At balloons.\nNo one? Ah well, no matter.\nSuffice to say that it works, in\nthat cartoony Flash game style\nthat we all know and love.\nThe goal of the game is simple enough: pop all the balloons using a limited number\nof darts, but the execution is\nsplendid \u2013 challenging, but\nrarely frustrating and always\nequally rewarding. And with\n250+ levels of balloon carnage\nto go through and multiple\npowerups and special balloons\nto keep it interesting, it can\nbecome a lifelong addiction.\nMuch like heroin or World of\nWarcraft (neither of which Felix\nendorses, fyi.). Bloons is proof\npositive that monkeys and\ndarts are meant to be together.\nBiologists, get on it.\nSebastian Nordgren\nT\nicket to Ride is an absolutely top-notch game\nwith broad appeal, playing in less than an hour\nand providing much\ndepth without being over-complicated.\nOne of the most popular board games\ndesigned in recent times, Ticket to Ride\nis a simple yet strategic game of connecting cities with trains.\nTicket to Ride is so simple to learn\nthat it\u2019s hard to write a summary without giving away all the goodies. The\nrulebook is just 4 pages long (including\nthe illustrations)! As a result, the gameplay elements behind Ticket to Ride\ncan be understood in 3 minutes, yet\nplayers face strategic and tactical decisions that vary with every turn. Players collect cards of various types that\nare then used to claim railway routes\nconnecting various cities across a map\nof Europe. The routes are of differing\nlengths (requiring varying numbers of\nmatching coloured cards), and each\ndiscrete route marked on the board can\nbe claimed by only a single player.The\nlonger the routes, the more points they\nearn. Additional points come to those\nwho can fulfill Destination Tickets \u2013\nsecret goal cards that connect two distant cities; and also to the player who\nbuilds the longest continuous route.\nThe game has a nice risk-taking ele-ment, as players must be cautious not\nto take too many Destination Ticket\ncards, for fear of heavy penalizations at\nthe game\u2019s conclusion. There are plenty of things to watch, no dice to roll\nand you are mostly in control of how\nwell you succeed; of course, there are\nplenty of ways to try to hinder others\u2019\nprogress. Although unique in format,\nit draws on the set-collecting aspect of\nthe classic card game Rummy and thus\nfeels familiar to many players.\nBoth experienced players and newcomers alike find tension grows with\neach succeeding turn with winning\nstrategies seemingly endless: no wonder Ticket to Ride is one of the most\nhonoured board games in the world;\nwinning the game of the year in Japan, France, Finland, Sweden, Spain\nand Spiel de Jahres (Germany\u2019s Family\nGame of the Year) \u2013 the most coveted\nprize in the board games industry .\nWithin eight months of being released\nin March 2004, Ticket to Ride sold more\nthan 250,000 packs. It has spawned\nfour editions \u2013 USA, Europe (the version we played), Marklin/Germany\nand Switzerland \u2013 with a fifth (Nordic\nCountries) on the way.\nAs play continues the board begins\nto fill with routes, pressure builds as\neach player becomes increasingly concerned about completing their destination tickets. Will they succeed before\nanother player blocks their cities? Can\nthey take over the long-haul routes to\nget bonus points? Will they gamble on\ncutting through the tunnels? With each\nturn, the decision to claim a train route\nnow or draw more cards becomes ever\nmore crucial.\nUnlike a lot of new board games,\nTicket to Ride succeeds in its approach-ability, making it as appealing as classic\ntitles like Monopoly or Cluedo, while\nstill being as compelling and robust\nas Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne.\nIn other words, it\u2019s a \u201cgateway game\u201d:\nfantastic for new players, and equally\nbrilliant for hardened veterans of non-digital fare.\nThe game itself is hard to criticise as\nthere are very few weaknesses in this\nformat \u2013 the only slight issue is the\nboard orientation which means that\ndepending on what side of the game\nyou are playing it is difficult to read the\ncity names upside-down. Also a basic\nknowledge of geography does help in\nlocating the cities on your tickets as\nprolonged scanning of the board or\nasking a fellow player can give away\nyour planned route.\nReally, unless you\u2019re just totally unable to appreciate any board game,\nTicket to Ride is a must have for your\ngaming closet. The fun, ease of play\nand replayability all make Ticket to Ride\ngreat value for your gaming pound.\nFirst Europe, then the World Nooooo, you bastard, not there!\nAlex prepares to lay down the station; it allows him to use our tracks\nSee what we did there? Hehe...\nGrow my precious train, groooow and devour them all!\n\n"

    "content": "once removed from himself.\nAndy was representative of a gen-eration, using fashion as one of their\nmeans, to create a public image, their\nown persona. It inspires a fashion philosophy embracing the superficial yet\nrejecting nihilism. In taking the meaning away from fashion you can either\nbe shackled by image, or free to create\nwhat you wish.\nfashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nFashion\nFashion Editor \u2013 Sarah Skeete\nThe Superficial Superstar\nA\nndy Warhol reflected the\nconsumerist, celebrity\nnature of modern society.\nSome argued that his art\nwas all surface, easily recognisable images that were essentially\nmeaningless. I believe Andy Warhol\ndelighted in taking the superficial, and\nshowing that while it\u2019s meaningless in\nitself, it has personal meaning aa an element of popular culture.\nIn a way, the 20th century was a crys-tallisation of the increasing individualism of society. In the past people lived\nand worked together and the group\nmeant more than the individual. Now\npeople live in wider communities and\nmore autonomously and individual-ised. Mass production and mass media\nincreasingly tie society together. This\nnew mass age also allows you to create\nand proliferate images and ideas. It\u2019s an\nenvironment that makes it possible to\nconstruct a public persona, it gives a\nmeans to propagating your image.\nWarhol\u2019s celebrity paintings weren\u2019t\nabout the person behind the star they\nwere entirely about the surface. For\nall we really know about celebrities is\nthe persona they project to the media.\nThey are people turned into a brand\nfor public consumption. It\u2019s the myth\nthat launches them to stardom, without it they\u2019re just any other person.\nAs a child, Warhol fell in love with ce-lebrity, the world of films and stars. He\nwas a veritable movie junkie, collecting\nthe free publicity stills in a box. It was\nearly on in his life he began constructing a persona about himself, picking up\naffectations from film stars, emulating\nhis idols\u2019 gestures and personal tics.\nWarhol found his persona useful in\ncareer, it gave him notoriety but also\nanonymity. When starting out as a\ncommercial artist he took to wearing\nthe same khaki trousers and beat up\nt-shirt everyday. Even when he started\nmaking enough money to dress well,\nhe\u2019d put on his \u2018Raggedy Andy costume\u2019 when going out to meet clients.\nHe found they liked the idea of hiring a\npoor starving artist.\nHe also, of course, famously wore a\nwhite wig, drawing a veil over his real\nage. He took pains to appear as blank as\npossible, to not give any part of himself\naway. In public he talked monosyllabi-cally, using simply yes, no and \u2018I hadn\u2019t\nreally thought about it\u2019. He peppered\nhis speech with ums and uhs, managing to talk without saying much at all.\nAny criticisms of his art he publicly\nagreed with, giving nothing of his true\nfeelings away. As Warhol once said,\nit\u2019s fascinating when a person puts up\na blank front, \u201cbecause you absolutely\n[can\u2019t] tell if [he\u2019s] a genius or a retard\u201d.\nLike Kate Moss (prior to breaking\nher public silence) below the surface\nhe seemed to be a void. People could\ninterpret him as they wanted. He remained meaningless so that people\ncould only guess about the man behind\nthe mask. He seemed to put everything\na step away from himself. Even the way\nhe painted, using silk screening, was\nAndy Warhol, the superficial surface of the enigmatic Andy Warhola by Sarah Skeete\nCalvin Klein, advertpalooza\nNeat Hair\nI think we\u2019re all getting\nfairly tired of the drug-addled\nscoundrel look Pete Doherty\nhas epitomised for years.\nBoys, get out the hair pomade\nand thin-toothed combs, we\u2019re\nall going to look like we did on\nour first day of school!\nVans Shoes\nVans success in the footwear\nmarket means there\u2019s finally\nsome sort of Indie-cult rival\nto Chuck Taylors.

    "content": "politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nPolitics\nPolitics Editors \u2013 Li-Teck Lau and Kadhim Shubber\nWinners and inevitably losers\nL\noser, Rudy Giuliani has seen\nthe collapse of his campaign\nto win the Republican Presidential nomination after\nfailing to win the Florida\nprimary. His campaign strategy was\nuntested and unfamiliar. He avoided\ncontesting the early primaries and\ncauceses held in Iowa, New Hampshire\nand others, instead focusing his money\nand energy on a late big win in Florida\nthat, he hoped, would propel him to\nvictory overall.\nAlthough spending 3 times as much\ntime campaigning in Florida than the\nvictor (John McCain) as well as $50\nmillion overall on his campaign, he\nfinished an uninspiring 3rd. He has not\nyet withdrawn from the race, though\nan announcement is expected soon.\nNegotiations with frontrunner John\nMcCain will lead to him announcing\nhis support for McCain\u2019s candidacy\nsoon after he drops out of the race.\nTraditionally, in U.S politics, the early\nprimary states have a large amount of\ninfluence in decideding who becomes\nthe final presidential candidate. This is\nbecause a series of early wins allows a\ncandidate to gain momentum.\nBy ignoring this conventional wisdom Rudy Giuliani either promised to\nensure a quick exit or rewrite the political rules in the U.S. While other nominees have thrown up surprises during\nthis years campaigning, this was not to\nbe the case for Giuliani.\nA week is a long time in the world of politics; as these people found out, fortunes can change quickly\nUnion President Stephen Brown has\nnever been afraid of controversy \u2013 but\nas the Sabbatical elections draw close,\n\u2018Red Stephen\u2019 has come under fire\nfrom rivals.\nThe behaviour of his colleagues is\nunder question. Deputy President (Fi-nance and Services) Chris Larvin is\nunder pressure to resign after lying\nabout accepting a free luxury holiday\nas a guest of youth camp organisation\nKamp Afrika. The Deputy President\ninitially denied being in Nigeria; the\nUnion also issued a statement saying\nthat he was in London at the time.\nHowever a photograph of him canoeing in Nigeria forced him to admit the\ntruth. Questions are now being asked\nover why he and the Union gave false\nstatements but also about how stupid\nsomeone has to be to take a picture of\nthemselves when they\u2019re somewhere *This is satire; keep your hair on\nthey\u2019re not meant to be.\nStephen Brown personally, has come\nunder enormous criticism for admitting that he enjoyed a personal fiefdom.\nHe defended himself saying, \u201cThat\u2019s\nexactly what Sir Richard Sykes \u2013 and\nremember I was opposed to the idea\nat the beginning \u2013 set out to create.\nAnd if we didn\u2019t have that, I couldn\u2019t\nhave got the Union re-development\nthrough.\u201d However a disgruntled Union employee, lets call her K. Patterson; no - Kirsty P, has informed Felix\nthat Mr Brown is completely close-minded and refuses to work with other\npeople. He responded firmly \u201cThe Union system is one in which the President is the elected executive; I do not\nwork through endless layers of Deputy\nPresidents.\u201d\nUnfortunately for his credibility, this\nis not the only admission he has made.\nRecently, when asked why alcohol always goes missing from The Union\nBar, Stephen Brown admitted he drinks\nwhisky at 10am, usually before the\nSambucca but always after a few shots\nof Tuaca. As a defence for the whiskey\ndrinking, the Union President claimed\nhe used it \u201cas an anaesthetic\u201d in winter months to help his chest problems.\nWhen asked why he continues this regime during the spring, summer and\nautumn months he slurred, \u201cIt helps\nnumb the pain\u2026\u201d\nComing back on the offensive, President Stephen Brown has pointed to the\nmany successes of his time as a Sabbatical officer. \u201cViolent crime in Quad is\ndown, there are upgrades to the Southside underground resulting in better\nservice and we\u2019ve seen great results\nfrom the walkway congestion charge\u201d\nHe conceded the incidence of unsolved\nmurders has increased but denied that\nthe creation of an Assassins Society\nwas related. Keen to sound unworried\nby recent events he declared, \u201cIf the\nstudents don\u2019t like me they can vote me\nout.\u201d This is exactly what his main ri-val, former Deputy President (Finances\nand Services) Jon Matthews, is hoping\nwill happen. He has described Stephen\nBrown as being drunk on power, add-ing: \u201cNo matter how long someone\nhas been in the job, they\u2019re not above\naccountability\u201d. It remains to be seen,\nhowever, whether Mr Matthews can\nshake off his floppy haired image, balance an election campaign with a successful career on Have I Got News for\nYou and go twelve minutes without offending a city, race or continent.\nLuckily for Jon Matthews, the scandal\nsurrounding his presidency seemed too\nmuch for Stephen Brown in the recent\nUnion Council meeting, Felix reported\nlast week. With the council unwilling\nto succumb to his iron-fisted rule, he\nlost his temper with Deputy President\n(Education & Welfare) Kirsty Patterson. The full account of the meeting\nhas only come to light recently, apparently he not only told her to \u201cPipe\ndown!\u201d but continued \u201cSo help me God\nif you don\u2019t shut up I\u2019ll delay fixing the\nconstitution till 2012; you are just like\na concentration camp guard, you are\njust doing it because you are paid to,\naren\u2019t you?\u201d\nGiuliani loses, Kadhim celebrates Money, money, money, monieee!\nW\ninner, former British Prime Minister\nTony Blair has seen\nhis bank accounts\nfilled up after taking a series of jobs with major banks.\nHis most recent appointment, as an\nadvisor to Zurich Financial Services\nGroup (Zurich) will see him working\nclosely with Zurich\u2019s newly launched\nClimate Change Advisory Council.\nWhile neither Blair nor Zurich have\nreleased details of his salary, it is believed to be around \u00a32m a year. He also\nworks part-time as an advisor for JP\nMorgan. His salary for this part-time\njob could be as high as \u00a32.5m a year.\nIt is believed that Mr Blair will attempt to become the first full-time EU\npresident from next year. Among his\nsupporters for this \u00a3200,000 a year job\nis French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nIt is believed that he will face private\nresistance from Gordon Brown who is\nuneasy about having Tony Blair coming back into EU politics. Tories have\nalready taunted him over the prospect\nof seeing him welcome \u2018President Blair\u2019\nto Downing Street. Any sign of tension\nbetween Tony and Gordon would be\nseized on by the media.\nGaining the EU presidency would\nmean that Tony would have to give up\nlucrative business advisor roles. In the\nmeantime, he is clearly happy with a\nguaranteed healthy bank account for\nyears to come.\nThe Comeback kid. Well not really\nW\ninner, John McCain\nwins in Florida,\nbeating Giuliani\nout of the race and\npushing himself to\nthe front of the field and putting himself in good stead for future primaries\nJust a few months ago John McCain\nwas floating dead in the water, politically of course. After appearing as the\nobvious presidential candidate, his\ncampaign lost supporters and funds\nstarted to dry up. He was as good as\nout of the presidential race. However,\nafter victory in New Hampshire, South\nCarolina and now Florida he has staged\na remarkable comeback.\nHe is likely to secure the backing of\nRudy Giuliani after he drops out, and\nwith a general perception that McCain\nhas the potential to beat a democratic\ncandidate such as Hillary, things are\nlooking good for the ex-POW.\nHowever up to this point the race for\nthe Republican nomination has been\nanything but assured. McCain still\nfaces strong opposition from rival Mitt\nRomney. Romney\u2019s campaign staff\nbelieve that his ability to raise money\nand spend his own millions will allow\nthem to better highlight the contrast\nbetween their candidate\u2019s business\nbackground and McCain\u2019s long tenure\nin a partisan Washington.\nThe 5th of February, Super Tuesday,\nwill finally cement either McCain or\nRomney as the Republican candidate.\nSeriously, I\u2019m not corrupt. Honest\nL\noser, Peter Hain resigned\nhis position as work and\npensions secretary due to\nthe announcement that the\nMetropolitan police will\nbegin an investigation into his failure\nto declare donations to his deputy\nleadership campaign worth more than\n\u00a3100,000.\nHain has always insisted the failure to\ndeclare the donations to his campaign\nwas an accident and sources indicated\nhe would fight to \u201cclear his name\u201d from\nthe backbenches.\nHowever at the Electoral Commission officials were not impressed by\nHain\u2019s explanation that he was too\nbusy to comply with electoral law. The\nparty funding rules have been in force\nfor some time and failure to obey is a\ncriminal offence.\nThe Hain investigation is particularly embarrassing because it will be the\nthird high-profile police investigation\ninto alleged Labour breaches of electoral and funding law.\nIn the past some ministers have returned to office after resigning. But\nHain is not close to Brown and it is\nunlikely he will stage a comeback like\nPeter Mandelson or David Blunkett.\nThis latest investigation is likely to\nincrease pressure on Harriet Harman\nand Wendy Alexander who have both\nadmitted irregularities with campaign\ndonations and cement Labour\u2019s image\nas corrupt and sleazy.\nWhy doesn\u2019t anybody like me?\nL\noser, Italian Prime Minister\nRomano Prodi has handed\nin his resignation after losing a confidence vote. He\nwill continue as caretaker\nleader while the President, Giorgio\nNapolitano, decides whether to hold\ngeneral elections early.\nHe was forced out after just 20\nmonths in office, having been defeated\nin the senate, or upper house, by five\nvotes. The defeat, which spelled the\nend of the country\u2019s 61st government\nsince the Second World War, could\nalso herald a comeback for Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial former pre-mier. Berlusconi has kept up pressure\nfor new elections that he hopes will\nbring him back to lead Italy.\nThe collapse of the government had\nbeen widely predicted following a\nstream of defections. Several key figures in Mr Prodi\u2019s centre-Left coalition\nhad refused to support him in the vote,\neffectively ensuring his defeat.\nDuring the vote, the Italian Parliament was the scene of intense drama.\nSenator Tommaso Barbato was forcibly\nremoved from the Senate session while\nSenator Stefano Cusumano collapsed\nduring the vote. Senators from the opposition National Alliance party celebrated with champagne as the results\nof the confidence vote was announced.\nThe change of government is unlikely\nto bring the radical change needed to\nhelp Italy\u2019s unhealthy economy.\nScandal hits Union President Stephen Brown*\nSamuel Black\n\n"

Terry wakes up at 3am to find\nyou with local anaesthetic in one hand and a\nhacksaw in the other. What will you do?\nScorpio\nYou find Terry\u2019s\ntalk so fascinating\nthat you decide\nto become a\nlumberjack. You\nrealise that your\nlack of feet might hinder your entry into the\nworld of all things arbourial. You decide to\nfashion prosthetic feet out of a lovely oak tree\nin your garden. The skill with which you carve\nout some feet out of timber will demonstrate\nyour skill with trees you think.\nLibra\nIn the heat of the\nmoment you explain\nto him that you are\nlearning woodwork\nand want to practice\non his chest-of-drawers. The reason you have the anaesthetic\nyou tell him is because you believe that wood\nfeels pain. Terry then spends 4 hours explaining to you how trees grow and you find his talk\nimmensely interesting.\nSagittarius\nOn Wednesday you\nclimb to the top of\nthe oak tree finding\na branch that you\nwill claim for your\nprosthetic feet.\nHowever, due to your lack of traction on the\nend of your legs, you slip and in your footlust\nfall to your death into a rosebush.

    "content": "4 felix Friday 1 February 2008\nUnion Elections 2008\nCurrent Sabbatical Interviews\nPassing on the mantle\nSTEPHEN\nBROWN\nUNION\nPRESIDENT\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed most this year?\nI have really enjoyed meeting and\nworking with such a diverse range of\npeople. It was a bit bizarre being elected to work along side other sabbaticals\nthat I didn\u2019t really know that well but it\nhas been good fun.\nI\u2019ve also enjoyed meeting a lot more\nof the student body than I did as an\nundergrad. One of the most rewarding parts of this job is seeing the sheer\nnumber of students currently engaging\nin Union activity and I think it is fantastic that this is still the case given the\nhigh workload that students at Imperial have.\nWhat aspect of your work have\nyou enjoyed least this year?\nAll of the sabbatical officers came in\nto post with a great deal of enthusiasm\nand a lot of really good ideas. What has\nbeen frustrating is that you realise that\nthe implementation of something new\ndoes not happen overnight and that it\ntakes a lot of time and effort to see anything substantial come to fruition.\nWhich qualities would you say\nare needed to carry out your job?\nYou definitely need a sense of humour\nfor this job combined with an ability to\nstep back from it all. With the number\nof hours you put in it can be disheartening when some things don\u2019t go according to plan so you do need to be able\nto put things into their proper context.\nYou can at times feel bogged down and\nfeel like the job has consumed you but\nwhen this happens you need to be able\nto try and focus on the successes.\nHow was being a Sabbatical different to what you expected?\nNot radically different. I was involved\nwith the Union and Felix before I stood\nfor this position so I did have a good\nidea about\nhow the place\noperates.\nHowever,\nI did underestimate how\nmuch my first\nfew months in\noffice would be\ndictated by issues\nthat were rolling\nover from my predecessor\u2019s time. This\nwasn\u2019t necessarily a\nbad thing but it did take\nme aback slightly.\nHow would you like students to\nremember your term?\nI don\u2019t \u2013 that would be terribly\nnarcissistic.\nDo you think you\u2019ve achieved\nyour aims this year? If so, what\nwere they?\nI do keep reading my manifesto on a\nmonthly basis but it is very difficult to\nfind the time to focus on the things I\nstill have left to do. My manifesto consisted of a lot of little things, a lot of\nThe infamous Sabbatical 2007/08 photo. Look at them. So happy, weren\u2019t they?\nO\nn Monday nominations\nfor the 2008 Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU)\nElections opened. Since\nthen, more than ten\npeople have already put themselves forward for the various Sabbatical Officer\npositions and many more are expected\nto follow over the coming week as the\ndeadline for nominees approaches.\nThis time last year the five people\nfeatured on the next three pages entered the 2007 election race and successfully managed to convince the voting student body that they were worthy\nof their respective positions.\nFelix interviewed each of the current\nICU Sabbatical Officers to find out how\ntheir terms have been, whether they\nhave enjoyed their time in office and\nwhat the future holds. Don\u2019t worry, the\nFelix Editor didn\u2019t interview himself;\nPolitics Editor Kadhim Shubber posed\nthe questions in this feature.\nIf you\u2019ve already put yourself up for\nnomination or you\u2019re dilberating about\nwhether to do it, read these interviews\nand hopefully you\u2019ll get a better idea\nof what it\u2019s like to take a year out from\nyour studies and to work in the Union.\nThe Union is run with students at the\nhelm, for students. If you feel up to the\ntask, log on to www.imperialcollege-union.org/vote and stand for election.\nYou will need to get twenty of your\nfriends to login and second you too.\nNominations close on Monday 11th\nFebruary! Good luck.\nwhich have been delivered and I still\nhave 5 months left. This year has seen\nincreased support for Faculty Unions,\na more diverse catering offer introduced and I even stuck to my promise\nof constructive engagement with the\nNational Union of Students despite my\nown personal misgivings.\nWhat has been the most important thing you have achieved so\nfar?\nSecuring the funding for the Union\nBuilding redevelopment was a massive step forward. We have use of a\ngreat building over in Beit Quad and it\nis good that the College has acknowledged that if the student body is to get\nthe full benefit from it then it needs\nmodernisation.\nIf there was\none thing you\ncould change\ninstantly\nabout how the\nUnion is run,\nwhat would it\nbe?\nPersonally I would like to see\nthe profile of our student welfare and our capacity for academic\nrepresentation given a bit more promi-nence. I know these issues are a lot\nduller than clubs, societies and social\nevents but they are the Union\u2019s reason\nfor being and in my view it is important that this ethos is not lost. Being a\nStudents\u2019 Union makes us sound a lot\nmore authoritative than if we were a\nStudents\u2019 Social Club and I would like\nto take this\nHow do you see the Union developing over the next few years?\nThe Union is currently going through\na process of significant internal change\nwhich is not immediately obvious to\nthe student body. We have got very\ngood participation in student activities\nbut we would like to increase participation on the welfare and representation side of things.\nDo you think there is a problem\nwith low turnout in the Union?\nCompared to other institutions our\nelection turnout is actually quite good.\nThere is always room for improvement\nbut it is the elections candidates who\ndrive up turnout so in order for turnout to increase we need a lot of people\nrunning for positions and doing some\ngood old-fashioned campaigning.\nIf you are not leaving Imperial\nat the end of this year, will you\nbe involved with the Union next\nyear?\nNot applicable \u2013 I am out of here!\nDo you honestly think Sabbaticals\nmake a difference at all?\nYes I do. Decisions taken by the management of College affect us all and in\nmy view the most important role that\nsabbatical officers play is giving student input whilst decisions are being\ntaken. If there were no sabbatical officers then students would find it considerably more difficult if they had a problem with their course, accommodation\nor even the food in the JCR if they had\nto do the work from scratch.\nDo you feel an urge to get into\nmainstream politics?\nNot at all. I want to get a proper job\nwhen I leave the College in a few\nmonths. Personally I think that a law\nshould be passed putting a lower age\nlimit on our politicians. That would\nthen save us the ridiculous spectacle of\nsabbaticals leaving the Students\u2019 Union\nbubble and thinking that their opinions\non war, peace and the health service\nare of any remote use to society.\nStand for nomination: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n\n"

But\nChuck Norris has little\nuse for women. To Chuck Norris, the\nword wife is an acronym that explains\nwhat women are for: washing, ironing,\nfucking, etc.\nStatistics speak for themselves: 50%\nof women have lower than average IQ.\nThat\u2019s pretty amazing when you compare it to guys, of whom 50% have a\nhigher than average IQ.\nGirls usually played a very small role\nin Chuck Norris\u2019 life, but the years have\nnot been kind to Chuck, and recently\nhe\u2019s been longing for some lovin\u2019 from\nthe weaker sex. That\u2019s not to say that\nany males are the stronger sex. at least\nnot compared to Chuck.\nChuck Norris likes girls of all kinds,\nand all kinds of girls like Chuck Norris.\nLesbians do not exist for Chuck Norris, as lesbians are women who have\nnot yet met Chuck.\nAll of last week, Chuck Norris was\nbusy checking out the union. Unfortu5 6 7 8\nThe lack of girls in Imperial has been\ntaking a toll on poor Chuck Norris.\nThe girls are all either indistinguishable from guys, weigh as much as five\nguys, act like guys, or are guys.\nJust drop into the Sci-fi library. Everyone has long black hair and a long\nblack trenchcoat, regardless of gen-der. Chuck Norris approves of this\nequality!\nFor this week\u2019s sweet CNUT, you\nhave to guess whether the person in\nthe photos on the right is engaging in\nsexual activity (of any kind) or they are\njust extremely happy (or scared) to see\nChuck Norris.\nThis way, Chuck Norris kills two\nstones with one bird \u2014 the quiz is done,\nand his sexual appetite is satiated.\nOnce again, send your answers to\ncoffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk for the\nchance to win a prize at the end of\nterm, which may or may not include\nalcohol and a Chuck Norris mug.\nChuck Norris promises to get the\nleague table ready by next week, so\ngood luck and remember, if at first\nyou do not succeed, you\u2019re not Chuck\nNorris.\nLast week\u2019s answers\n1 & 2.

Unlike Chuck Norris,\nwho has never had an alcohol problem (although alcohol has had a Chuck\nNorris problem), they always seem to\nend up outside on the ground, cry-ing, like last Friday. They even had the\ncheek to argue that Ringo Starr is the\nworst Beatle, and that the New York\nGiants are the best team. Chuck Norris\npromptly gave them a roundhouse kick\nin the face.\nDo note, though, that Chuck Norris\nhas nothing against Americans. In fact,\nsome of his best friends are Americans!\nAnyway, back to the topic of girls.\nChuck Norris sleeps with every woman\nin the world once a month. That\u2019s the\nreason they bleed every month. Unfortunately, it also causes them to get\npretty irritable. Chuck Norris knows a\nlot of things, even where Wally is hid-ing, but one thing Chuck does not understand is women.\nWomen are both fascinating and\nscary. Of course, Chuck Norris isn\u2019t\nafraid of anything \u2013 he does sleep at\nnight with his light on, but that\u2019s only\nbecause the dark is afraid of Chuck\nNorris. But women, they are incompre-hensible. One minute they love Chuck\nand send him love letters, like the hottie fangirl on the left, and the next day\nthey act as cold as the dead thetans\nChuck has scattered all over the world,\nas if Chuck had roundhouse kicked the\ngirl in the face and then impregnated\nher. That is impossible because Chuck\nNorris\u2019 bearded little legion of swimmers only do what Chuck Norris tells\nthem to do!\nSo next week Chuck Norris will\nbe out on the prowl in dBs; although\nChuck Norris does not dance, he\nroundhouse kicks to the sexy beat!\nLadies should be aware that Chuck\nNorris is always on top when he has\nsex, because he never fucks up.\nIn closing I\u2019d like to say: there are two\nfish in a tank. One shouts to the other:\n\u201cYou man the guns, I\u2019ll drive!\u201d\n34 felix Friday 1 February 2008\n\n"

This structure has novel features which are of considerable biological interest\".\nOur understanding of DNA has\ncome along way since James Watson\nand Francis Crick published their era-defining paper in Nature all the way\nback in 1953, but the remarkable mole-cule's latest feat seems to be bordering\non witchcraft. A team from Imperial\nhave discovered that individual strands\nof DNA are capable of recognising and\norganising each other without the aid\nof any assisting enzymes or proteins.\nThe findings, published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B this month,\ncould be important in helping to uncover the way in which homologous\nrecombination gets started.\nHomologous recombination is a key\nprocess which our genes use to reshuffle themselves between generations, as\nwell as repair themselves after damage,\nand involves identical stretches of genetic material on different strands of\nDNA lining up with each other before\nswapping information. It has generally\nbeen assumed that this kind of behaviour would be impossible without the\nhelp of some protein or some other\nmediation.\nThe researchers, however, have proposed that the identical DNA strands\nactually attract each other electrostati-cally - the same way a suitably charged\nballoon can attract your hair.\nThe idea is controversial, because\nthe bits of DNA which allow it to carry\ninformation - the A, T, G and C bases\n- are located on the inside of the famous double-helix. They're encased by\ntwo relatively boring sugar-phosphate\n'backbones', which provide the structural integrity of the molecule. Because\nImran Khan\nDNA strands seek partners electrostatically\nthe backbone of the molecule is uniform in structure, it was assumed that\nany electrostatic properties of the bases on the inside wouldn't make any difference to the electrostatic properties\nas visible from the outside, and so one\ndouble-helix of DNA would look pretty\nmuch the same as any other.\nThe researchers found, though, that\nstrands with similar sequences actually do have a habit of pairing up with\neach other. Prof. Alexei Kornyshev, one\nof the study's authors, pointed out that\n\"seeing these identical DNA molecules\nseeking each other out in a crowd,\nwithout any external help, is very exciting indeed\".\nThe molecules are capable of finding\neach other from distances of more than\na nanometer apart, and the longer the\nstrands of DNA are, the stronger the\nattraction seems to be.\nThis lends weight to the electrostatic\nhypothesis, though the team admit\nthey can't rule out other mechanisms\njust yet. \"Formation of local single-stranded bubbles and base flipping may\ncause transient cross-hybridization\",\nthey point out, but also consider it to\nbe \"rather unlikely\".\nThe famous double-helix. Imperial scientists have just shown how similar strands of the stuff can identify\neach other at a distance.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nRosie Grayburn\nArts Editor\nA\nre you feeling cooped up\nlike those poor chickens\non the telly? Do you constantly moan about how\nyou haven\u2019t had a proper\nbreak since September? My diagnosis\nis you clearly need to top up your RWC\n(recommended weekly culture). A simple way to do this is to read Felix Arts\npages once a week.\nIf symptoms persist, you may be suffering from severe laziness. This can be\neasily treated with a couple of hours\u2019\nexposure to an art gallery, museum\nor theatre. Consult your newspaper\narts listings before carrying out any of\nthese treatments. Alternatively, see the\nopposite page for a guide of how to approach the South Bank\u2019s amusements.\nComplementary treatments can be\nadded to improve further the results of\nculture exposure. [Fairtrade] Caffeine\ncan be purchased widely in many arts\ninstitutions and is a popular addition\nto any gallery visit. On the other hand,\nmany patients have found writing an\narticle for their student newspaper has\nmassively increased their RWC.\nOn this topic, Delighted of Hammersmith commented, \u201cMy RWC soared\nafter I was sent to review a big gallery\nopening for Felix\u2026 And all I had to do\nwas email arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk!\u201d\nThis week in Felix, we have some\nlovely regular features to keep you\nglowing with culture. Lucy Harrold,\nour own Musical Theatre guru, tells\nyou all you need to know about West\nSide Story. When you eventually get on\nUniversity Challenge, your little face\nwill light up when Paxman announces\n\u201cRight, your bonuses are on that famous Leonard Bernstein musical.\u201d\nI continue my mission this page to introduce famous areas in London where\nyou can chill for the day whilst conveniently upping your RWC and decreasing your DTA (Daily Telly Allowance)\nand LISL (Lab-Induced Stress Levels).\nWe at Felix Arts are currently recruiting writers and we would love to\nhear from you. If you are interested\nat all in reviewing the \u2018From Russia\u2019\nexhibition at the Royal Academy, the\nNational Portrait photographic Prize\nat the National Portrait Gallery or the\nnew Launchpad at the Science mu-seum, please get in touch at the usual\naddress. We will sort out the tickets,\nwhich applies to anything you fancy\nreviewing.\nApart from that the theatres around\nLondon are blooming with life. I blame\nglobal warming personally. At the Old\nVic Jeff Goldblum stars in Speed the\nPlow alongside Kevin Spacey.\nBefore you get too excited, don\u2019t\nforget the smaller productions. At the\nKing\u2019s Head Theatre in Islington, The\nDybbuk is showing until February 24th\n(www.kingsheadtheatre.org) and on\nsome nights you can see the acclaimed\nFucking Men at the Finborough Theatre (www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk). If\nyou find yourself gracing these theatrical institutions and you find yourself\nangered or inspired by the play/concert\nyou are viewing, please tell us about it.\nWe\u2019d like that.\nHow to get out of your hole\nPart 1: South Bank. Rosie Grayburn shows you how to do the South Bank. Oo-er\nT\nhis week in Felix\u2019s Guide\nto Days Out of Fun and\nEnjoyment, we take you\non a journey along the\nSouth Bank of the Thames\nfrom Waterloo to Southwark.\nThe South Bank is a cultural hub of\ntheatres, galleries, restaurants and ar-chitecture. There is the National Theatre, Shakespeare\u2019s [excellent imitation]\nGlobe Theatre, The Tate Modern, The\nOXO tower\u2026\nFuck me \u2013 that is a lot of culture!\nYou are very observant, Mr Generic\nStudent in Bold Type. How to get\nthere: train/tube/bus to Waterloo. Easy\npeasy. Things you need: Camera (to fit\nin with generic tourists), money (to\nbuy sustenance and postcards) and a\ncopy of Hamlet\u2019s soliloquy (to play pretend at the Globe). Websites to check\nout before you venture out: www.visit-southwark.com\n1. The South Bank is clearly signed\nfrom the station, but still bring an A\nto Z or map of some description as it\nmay be useful further on. When you\nget to the river, turn RIGHT onto \u2018The\nQueen\u2019s Walk\u2019, which will take you\nmost of the way along the South Bank.\nIf you dare turn left, you will see the\nLondon Eye and the Houses of Parliament straight in front of you. Please\ndon\u2019t go that way. We\u2019ve seen it all\nbefore.\n2. Follow the river and you will pass the\nNational Theatre and the Royal Festival Hall, purveyors of fine concerts and\nplays for years. The National Theatre\nhas recently been saved from concrete\ndeath by being presented with a \u2018mood\u2019\nlight on its head. This detracts from\nthe ugly concrete and looks very pretty\nwhen it is dark.\nIncidentally, there are some very\ntasty cafes underneath the Royal Festival Hall in case you get peckish this\nearly on in the day, fatty. See http://\nwww.nationaltheatre.org.uk/ for current \u2018what\u2019s on\u2019 listings. If you don\u2019t\nfancy a play or concert, the buildings\nare interesting to have a poke around.\n3. As you continue to walk in the SAME\ndirection along the Thames, you will\npass under the OXO Tower. This houses a very fancy restaurant owned by\nHarvey Nicks. Someone recently suggested that all they served was different\nflavoured OXO cubes with a garnish of\nsalad. We can only dream, eh?\n4. You will next pass under Blackfriars\nBridge, home to buskers and traders\nselling little, useless objects. When you\nhave passed this section you will be\nfaced with the gargantuan Tate Modern in what used to be the Bankside\nPower Station.\nI love this building. The turbine hall\nis so cavernous and dwarfing \u2013 it is\nworth just popping in the [free] entrance to stand in the centre of it to\nsoak up the grey, empty atmosphere.\nThe infamous \u2018Crack\u2019 or \u2018Shibboleth\u2019\nis currently occupying some Turbine\nspace, so watch out for overexcited\nsmall children and adults.\n5. Once you have exhausted the Tate\nModern and perhaps had a coffee break\nin its caf\u00e9, the next amusement along is\nthe Globe Theatre. It was painstakingly\nreconstructed from original designs\nand authentic materials, like blood,\nmud and macadamia nuts (honestly!!).\nThe open air theatre does not start\nits season until April but it still does\ntours around the theatre with exuberant guides all year round. Have a look\nat www.shakespeares-globe.org for\nmore details. The mostly hands-on exhibition underneath the theatre is very\nenjoyable, if you like pretending to be\nShakespearean characters and dressing\nup in pantyhose. I do.\n6. If you are getting bored of the South\nBank now, or if you have superstitions\nabout \u2018banks\u2019 or \u2018south\u2019 things take a\nride (and it really is) on the Millennium\nBridge towards the City. Indulge in St.\nPaul\u2019s Cathedral, the Bank of England\nand The Museum of London.\n7. If you want to stick to the South\nBank, follow signs and crowds in the\nsame direction to the area of Southwark. Follow a map if it will make you\nfeel better.\nThis is a very old part of London. You\ncan imagine it being smelly, noisy and\nwonderfully \u2018orrible. It is mostly cobbled and contains ancient cathedrals\n(www.southwark.anglican.org/cathe-dral); , historic ships docked (www.\ngoldenhinde.org) and the very authentic tourist trap: The London Dungeon\n(www.thedungeons.com). Have a wander around the streets, but don\u2019t stray\ntoo far or you\u2019ll end up at Guy\u2019s Hospital (booo!).\n8.AttheendofthisslogalongtheSouth\nBank, you are greeted by the welcome\nsight of Borough Market (www.bor-oughmarket.org.uk). It is a labyrinth\nof stalls selling wonderful, local, delicious produce. If you are repelled by\nthe not-so-wonderful, delicious prices\nit is fantastic to walk around and soak\nup the atmosphere. It is open Thursday\nto Saturday until the mid- afternoon.\n9. Time to go home. If you are super-adventurous, why not wander a bit further up the Thames to Tower Bridge,\nthe Tower of London and all that\ncomes with it?\nIf you do end up venturing up that\nfar and your stomach starts complaining about neglect, why not take it for a\nrollercoaster ride in the famous Brick\nLane \u2018curry mile\u2019, just around the corner from the Tower of London.\nWe come to the end of our jaunt along\nthe South Bank. To get home, you can\nwalk back along to Waterloo bypassing the sights or get the tube from\nBlackfriars, which is closer to Borough\nMarket.\nIf your expedition has been a sucess,\nplease send us a postcard. If there was\nanything you discovered on your travels that we missed off, please send us\nan email to let us know and we might\njust publish it.\nNext week we push you a little\nfurther and explore Greenwich\nand Canary Wharf.\nThe wonderfully industrial OXO tower where you can eat very poncy\nfood: OXOtail soup, OXO caesar salad, OXO and martini, OXO frites...\nAll the world\u2019s a Stage... Inside the Globe Theatre. You\u2019d be fucked if\nyou promised \u201cI\u2019ll eat my hat\u201d and you were wearing one of those\n\n"

This small indie flick, which\nfirst popped up on the festival circuit\nin the middle of last year, has smas-sively snowballed in influence. It is set\nto become the surprise sleeper hit at\nthe Oscars later this month, snagging\nnominations for the coveted Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actress\ncategories amongst others, a considerable feat considering the three driving forces behind it are all 30 or under.\nAnd so, Felix are bringing you everything you need to know about the film\neveryone\u2019s talking about a week prior\nto release (8th Feb) so that you can stay\ntop of the pile.\nThe appeal of Juno no doubt rests\non the shoulders of lead actress Ellen\nPage who seems to have transcended\nAcademy perceptions of a Best Actress\ncandidate, beating out the hotly-tipped\nAngelina Jolie and Keira Knightley. Not\nbad for a young woman only featuring\nin her second high profile feature. Although only two years younger than\nKnightley, her nod has raised eyebrows\nbecause she is playing a child, not the\nyoung women that Keira\u2019s face lends itself to, a role that would normally only\nelicit voting sympathy in supporting\ncategories.\nThen again, it would be impossible to relegate Page to a supporting consideration given she plays the\neponymous protagonist. Her effortless humour is endearing although her\nstunning eloquence of speech (albeit\nthe voice of screenwriter Diablo Cody,\nsee later) allows the audience to identify with Juno on an adult level despite\nthe story squarely identifying her\nas a child. What use is a story\nof teenage pregnancy if the\ncentral character appears\nadult enough to effortlessly\nbreeze through it all?\nPage\u2019s downfall, however,\ncould be her childlike im-age. Whilst Keira is not as\nconsummate an actress,\nshe has adult roles and\na beauty that will always\nfind her work, no matter\nhow wooden she may be.\nPage has a very young\nappearance that has\nattimesseemed\nto contra-With more buzz than a swarm of killer bees, Juno seems to be delighting audiences of\nall ages as Felix asks why a pregnant 16-year old girl has managed to cause such a fuss\nAlex Casey\nA\nnd so now I bring you a\nsmall discussion of the\nOscars nods, a week late,\nperhaps, but with that\ntime well-spent to say\nsomething about the sad passing of\nHeath Ledger. Still, you don\u2019t know the\nwinners yet, so perhaps you can find\nsomething in here to have a small flutter down the bookies with.\nThe semi-finals are over. If your\nname\u2019s not on any of the ballots, you\nbetter book fast to get the cheapest\nticket home. Hollywood, and BAFTA,\ngave you your chance, and you blew it.\nAlthough you may be wondering why.\nOnce the Golden Globes are an-nounced, the road to the Oscars is\nmore a question of rearranging the\nmelee of names already mentioned\nthan picking up brand new hopes. Perhaps a Best Picture candidate falls out\nof favour but gets the consolation of a\nBest Cinematography nod by the end.\nMaybe you had a performance that bemused you by its absence from the lists\n(especially with the Globes\u2019 split cate-gories), but unless your film happened\nto make the Best Picture list, everyone\nwill have forgotten it ever existed until\nMarch. The Globes set the table, you\nchoose where you sit, but you can\u2019t\nbring friends to dinner.\nThe rare thing that the 2008 ceremony seems to have brought so far\nis following various shuffles by guild\nawards, Globes and BAFTAs, the\nAcademy have managed to optimise\nthe list of nominees with real talent\nbeing rewarded and the fluff being\nbumped to technical categories. Not\nthat there haven\u2019t been a few mistakes,\nof course.\nI\u2019m past caring that No Country for\nOld Men is the clear favourite. The\nwinners will no doubt be pretty disap-pointing, but the nominations themselves are good consolation. Atonement seems to have clung on after\nbeing shut out by each of the main US\nguild shows, and rightly so. Whilst not\na massive fan of the film, it was better\nthan Michael Clayton (bonus points\nfor anyone who saw this coming) and\nNo Country, and for proof that voting\nmembers cared about the different categories out there, the limp Keira and\nstrangely off-form McAvoy have been\nevicted. Please leave the Big Bother\nhouse.\nActing nominations have actually\nhad a bit of a boost. The talents of Laura Linney (woohoo) have edged out\nKnightley, but sadly Cate Blanchett\u2019s\nElizabeth shut out Angelina. For the\nmen, Viggo Mortenson usurps McAvoy and Johnny Depp got chucked in\nfor comedy value. Not that it matters\nwhen Daniel Day-Lewis is still on the\nguest list.\nWith There Will Be Blood the only\nmain contender as yet unseen by Felix,\nit\u2019s hard to know what to make of the\nrace. Joint leader in total nods, it has\ngenerated surprisingly little coverage\nfor anything other than Lewis himself.\nCan it be that underwhelming?\nSupport from this corner would go to\nJuno as the best of a mediocre bunch.\nHowever, for a bet, outside odds on\nAtonement pipping No Country. Unlikely, but more chance than Clayton.\ndict the intelligence that her roles in\nJuno and the 2005 thriller Hard Candy\nbestow upon her. In Hard Candy es-pecially, the shocking nature of her\nscenes pushed her character beyond\nthe realms of realism into the ridicu-lous, even it it was enjoyable, thought-provoking ridiculousness. At least the\ncoupling of such promise with some\nearly Academy recognition will give\nher the momentum she can hope for to\nget over the notoriously difficult teenage barrier.\nSomeone who\ndoesn\u2019t have\nsuch difficulty with\ntypecasting will\nbe Diablo Cody,\nwriter\nof Juno\nand creator of the\ncool indie\nedge it dis-plays. During\nthe London Film\nFestival, Cody and\ndirector Jason Reitman brought a small\nfilm that had a little bit of hype\naround it, although with Alison Janney and Jennifer Garner the only\nrecognisable names attached\nto the project, it was quickly\nlost amongst the bigger name\nprojects by David Cronenberg,\nWes Anderson, Sean Penn, etc.\nIn the basement of the Soho\nHotel, Felix listened to the\ncreative powers discussing\ntheir project with an affection that is rare among the\nbigger names who churn\nout hit after hit.\nCody came to screenwrit-ing from blogging, origi-nally, and described how\nher treatment of a real-life\nproblem such as teenage\npregnancy could only\nbe handled through hu-mour. \u201cYou can get away\nwith saying a lot more in a comedy\nthat you can in a drama\u201d trills Cody,\ndelightfully oblivious to the stress that\nthe situation could cause in reality.\nReitman is similarly playful, taking\ntime out of the conference to photograph the mountain of dictaphones under his nose with his new iPhone. His\nnomination as Best Director is probably the biggest shock of Juno\u2019s hoard\n(his only previous feature was the hit-and-miss Thank You For Smoking) and\nunprecedented in the rest of the awards\nseason. It was all the more surprising\ngiven that, for all the comparisons that\nhave been drawn with last year\u2019s Little\nMiss Sunshine, that film failed to swing\na directing nod, so Reitman must be\npretty pleased with himself.\nIndeed, I imagine the three of them\naren\u2019t that phased by the attention at\nall. These are just three young kids,\nsurfing the crest of a wave of praise.\nNew talent is always a bonus on the indie film scene, and that\u2019s the one thing\nthat Juno brings into the world.\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nJuno \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\nDirector: Jason Reitman\nWriter: Diablo Cody\nCast: Ellen Page\nMichael Cera\nJennifer Garner\nThis film is not quite the holy grail of\nindie filmmaking the Academy may\nhave you believe, but it\u2019s a good try.\nAmongst the somewhat dreary and depressing list of nominations, Juno provides a fun factor that would definitely\nbe worth going to see if you fancy a\nlight-hearted Sunday afternoon romp.\nIndeed, it\u2019s the very pursuit of such a\ndistraction that leads to the subject\nmatter involved, although not by taking the cinema route.\nJuno (Page) is a 16 year old girl who\nfinds herself pregnant after a tryst with\na school friend (Cera) and follows the\ncourse of her pregnancy. Cue the tears\nand tantrums, family betrayal and poor\nlittle girl with baby out on the streets.\nOr not. Juno sees a much funnier side\nto the whole thing, treating the idea of\npregnancy more as something along\nthe lines of a zit the week before prom.\nAnd Juno ain\u2019t no prom queen either,\nshe\u2019s cooler than that. Instead, Juno\ntreats the funny aspects of pregnancy\nand even the process of adoption with\na refreshing light-hearted touch that it\nhas used to endear itself to the world.\nEllen Page is great as Juno, albeit\nwith a ludicrously large lexicon, and\nis matched by Michael Cera as the\nwould-be love interest.\nAlison Janney manages to dispel the\nimage of the West Wing\u2019s CJ as the dog-loving stepmother of Juno, balancing\nthe frustration of Juno\u2019s attitude towards her with a real affection for\nthe girl to avoid any straight-forward\ncaricatures. Jennifer Garner is also im-pressive, if still annoying, as the highly\nstrung Stepford Wife looking to adopt\nJuno\u2019s baby into her seemingly perfect-but-childless family.\nThe script is the real sparkle here,\nand Diablo Cody has professed many\ntimes that the language children use is\na lot more sophisticated than you give\nthem credit for to account for Juno\nhaving an intellect that has wits much\nsharper than her aptitude for common sense. There are a few really good\nlaughs to be had here, and the scene\nin which Juno goes for her ultrasound\nstands out in particular for its strength,\nhumour and emotional resonance.\nWith the screenplay as the star, it\u2019s\nhard to understand why Reitman is\nnow an Oscar hopeful for Best Director. Perhaps people were just happy to\nsee the film and grateful for the man\nwho envisaged it and presented it so\nsimplistically. Juno, in the event of a\nwin, will not go down in history as a\nclassic picture. Charm it has in spades,\nbut longevity is not exactly guaranteed.\nAs we said before, Juno is simply a classic weekend afternoon romp.\nNope, it\u2019s not a baby, just wind\nEllen Page in Hard Candy\n\n"

    "content": "T\nhe omens were good\n\u2013 we had at least been\ngiven a new minibus\nwhich might not break\ndown\u2026 more than\ntwice. After the usual bout of guesses as to how long the drive will take,\nwhich always ends up being \u2018about\n6 hours\u2019 regardless of where we\u2019re\ngoing, the 13 of us finally left London for the North Pennines. I know\nthat whoever is reading this wants\na really detailed description of the\njourney but I\u2019m going to deny you,\nand just say that it rained when we\nstopped for food - in the Midlands,\nthat no-man\u2019s land of Britain. We\narrived in the tiny village of Melmerby at about 1am and were greeted by a massive town hall which\nhad central heating, a carpet and\na shower! Compared to the usual\nFellwanderers accommodation of a\nbarn with some chickens and a few\nrabid dogs prowling the fence this\nwas sheer luxury. The place even\nhad a stereo system and - unfortunately - Now 65 - \u2018Shakira Shakira\u2019!\nSaturday dawned and as we started the walk up into the Pennines\nwe could look across the Eden\nValley at the morning light hitting\nthe snow on the top of the Lake\nDistrict hills. We hoped that we\nwould get some snow on our walk\nand Chris \u201cEl Presidente\u201d teased\nus with \u2018maybe a little, right on the\ntop\u2019. The tops of our hills were obscured from about 400m by cloud\nand we slowly made our way up,\npast several sheep carcasses and\na large gully which Nathaniel and\nI wanted to slide down just before\nseeing a sign that told us to keep\nto marked paths; apparently there\nwere Badgers nearby, or Cougars,\nor a Griffin, anything was possible.\nSoon after Gareth sank in a stream\nand we had tried and failed to play\nbaseball with a crow-bar and a sat-suma, we hit the cloud line and ascended into the mist. At about the\nsame time we began to notice small\npockets of snow, prevented from\nmelting by the cold; there was even\na light white dusting on the scree\nwe passed on the way up. \u2018So this\nis the snow\u2019 we thought as I tried\nand failed to throw tiny snow-balls\nat everyone.\nBasically about 15 minutes later\nwe were in a blizzard; not only was\nthe snow deep enough to fall into\nbut it was coming from the sky.\nThis beautiful effect when inside a\ncloud is called a \u2018white-out\u2019. It was\nin these conditions we explored\nan abandoned silver-mine which\ncould have easily turned into a horror movie. For once Chris had to\ncrank out the compass, as we had\nto take bearings up the hill, passing\nabandoned mining winches and\nfrozen ponds. One of the ponds in\nparticular looked \u2018solid enough to\nstand on\u2019 and so I did, and fell in -well my leg did anyway. So that was\nme cold. At the top of our first peak\nA Winter's Tale\nby Alexander Kendall\n- Great Dun Fell - we came across the\nexpected radar station which loomed\nout of the mist like something from\nDoom. This was our lunch break and\nwe sheltered behind one of the buildings to get out of the wind. Most of\nus ate except for Gareth, who doesn\u2019t\nget hungry or cold \u2026 ever \u2026 and decided to build a snowman. Although it\nwasn\u2019t really a snow man but more of a\nsnow possessed child and it scared us\nso much that lunch ended and we set\noff again. The snow only got deeper as\nwe made our way over the next hill and\nthen finally a short scramble took us\non top of the highest peak of the North\nPennines - Cross Fell at 893m. We\n\u2018sheltered\u2019 for a few minutes behind a\nstone wall, built on many mountains by\npeople who have nothing else to do. By\nthis point it was too cold to even throw\nsnowballs and the lack of descriptive\nscenery in this report is simply due to\nthe fact that we couldn\u2019t see anything.\nThe compass was used again to\nfind our way off the mountain where\nwe hoped to join up with the Pennine\nWay which snaked back into the Eden\nValley. Since everything was snowed\nor iced over this was nearly impossible but we headed in the right direction and eventually found a path, after\nhaving to climb down the English version of the Hillary Step in a blinding\nsnow storm. It wasn\u2019t long before we\nwere free of the snow and then finally\nthe cloud as we again dropped below\n400m on our return to the minibus, via\na river crossing, and again saw the Lake\nDistrict opposite bathed in sunlight.\nThat night we cried because the local pub was closed but luckily NathanTold you it wasn\u2019t solid enough to walk on\niel, who doesn\u2019t drink in January\n(WHAT!) drove the minibus to\nthe next tiny village where there\nwas a pub, with a healthy selection of cake. Everyone had a pretty good, chilled-out time except\nfor Gareth who beat everyone at\npool and got drunk in true Fell\u201cA snow possessed child\u201d by Gareth\n\n"

See page 38\nOn Wednesday, while the rest of the\nACC was already going crazy in the\nUnion Bar, Imperial College Kendo\nClub was visited by the British National Coach Matsumoto-sensei. He joined\nus for our practice session and a few\ndrinks afterwards.\nAs usually the first half of our practice focused on footwork and basic\ntechniques. Matsumoto-sensei was\nwatching us practice under the directions of our instructor Yung-sensei.\nApparently Matsumoto-sensei was\npleased with what he saw and joined\nour seniors as sparring partner for our\nbeginners. So all our beginners got the\nrare chance to hit the National Coach\non the head. In the second half of the\npractice our seniors put on their bogu,\nthe kendo fencing armour, for some\nmore advanced practice. Matsumotosensei joined these drills and gave\nmany valuable comments and advice\nto our seniors.\nAt the end of the session we practised kendo sparring matches, called\njikeiko. Everybody got the chance to\nfight Matsumoto-sensei. Although\nnobody of us had the slightest chance\nagainst him it was an exciting and inspiring experience.\nHighlights of the evening were the\nmatches between Matsumoto-sensei\nand our instructors Yung-sensei and\nYoshikawa-sensei. Both our instructors are high ranking kendo players\nthemselves: Yung-sensei fought for\nHong Kong at the last World Championship and Yoshikawa-sensei recently\nwon yet another international competition in Dublin, Ireland. So all our\nmembers were watching in awe: their\nfights against Matsumoto-sensei were\nkendo presentations of highest quality.\nWithout noticing we overran our\nnormal practice time and it was almost\n11 when we arrived at the Union bar\nto have a pint with the National Coach.\nOverall this visit was a great experience\nfor our members. It proved once again\nthat our club has a good reputation in\nthe UK and that we are really lucky to\nhave two excellent Kendo instructors\nhere at Imperial.\nO\nver 1,150 university students will be heading\nwest to Swansea this\nweekend for the BUSA\nCross Country Championships, with a few students looking to impress before the World Cross\nCountry Championships, which are\nbeing held in Edinburgh on 30 March\nof this year.\nIn the men\u2019s competition 720 athletes line up with Frank Ticker\u2019s (ex\u2013\nBirmingham) 2007 title on the line.\nWith the top 3 men from last season\nhaving left university, the gold, silver\nand bronze will find new university\nhomes this season.\nKevin Deighton (Loughborough)\nfinished one place outside the medals\nlast year and will look to go one better\nand head back to Loughborough with\na medal.

During this\nzone the amount of fat being used as\nenergy is greatly reduced and the glycogen stored in your muscles is used.\nOne of the waste products of burning\nglycogen is lactic acid which builds up\nin the working muscles. Your anaerobic threshold is the point where your\nbody cannot remove lactic acid from\nthe working muscles quickly enough.\nThere is only a certain amount of lactic acid which the muscles can tolerate\nbefore fatigue and soreness sets in and\nthe exercise must be stopped. You can\ndelay the onset of fatigue through correct training of the lactic acid system\nand you may be able to increase your\ntolerance to lactic acid build-up.\nZone 90 \u2013 100% is only possible for\nshort periods of time and can help to\ndevelop speed by training your fast\ntwitch muscle fibres. Only the very fit\nare able to train effectively within this\nzone. It is recommended you seek advice about the correct way to train in\nthis zone due to the risks associated\nwith high heart rates.\nHopefully now you can find out if\nyour current exercise sessions have\nactually been making a difference to\nyou. If they haven\u2019t then you should\nnow have an idea of what intensity you\nshould be training at for certain re-sults. If you can\u2019t get hold of your own\nheart rate monitor then fear not\u2026 our\nrange of cardio machines in the gym\nhave heart rate monitors built in which\nyou can use whilst your exercising and\nwe can help you work out your THR\nso you can get the most out of your\nworkouts.\n39\nfelix\nFriday 1 February 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nMonitoring your heart rate\nHolly Plumley\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nDid you know your heart rate can be\nused as an accurate way of measuring\nyour aerobic exercise intensity and is\nan extremely useful tool in monitoring\nyour progress to reach your training\ngoals?\nThere are many types of heart rate\nmonitoring devices available. The most\npopular and with the latest technology\nare watches combined with a transmitter belt. They work by strapping the\nbelt containing electrodes across your\nchest and as you start exercising the\nelectromagnetic signal is sent to the\nwatch receiver where the heart rate is\ndisplayed on the face.\nBuying and using a heart rate monitor can only be beneficial to you if\nyou understand the heart rate readings you get when you\u2019re exercising\nand also knowing what the limits are.\nFirstly you will need to find out what\nyour Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) is.\nThis is the heart rate reading that you\ncan achieve during maximal physical\nexertion. It is not the maximum reading you should obtain often during exercise and if you are starting out with\nan exercise regime you should perform\nthis test in the presence of qualified\nstaff due to the risks associated with\nhigh heart rates. Your MHR is used as\na base number to calculate your Target\nHeart Rate (THR) for exercising. If you\ncan\u2019t get round to doing a MHR test\non a cardiovascular machine there are\nmany different formulas you can use\nto estimate your MHR, the most common being HR max = 220 \u2013 age. This\nis only to be used as an estimate as it\ncan very significantly depending on\nthe individual.\nYour THR is a desired range of heart\nrate reached during aerobic exercise to\nmake your heart and lungs receive the\nmost benefit from a work out session.\nTHR can be calculated by using an intensity range of 50% - 80% (see chart\nbelow.) One way to calculate your THR\nis the Karvonen method, this uses your\nResting Heart Rate (RHR). The average\nadult male\u2019s heart beats at 70 bpm and\nthe average adult female\u2019s heart beats\nat 75 bpm although again this can vary\ndepending on the individual. To find\nyour RHR count your pulse for one\nminute as soon as you wake up whist\nstill in bed. You can average your heart\nrate over three mornings to obtain\nyour average resting heart rate. When\nyou have both your MHR and RHR you\ncan use the Karvonen formula THR =\n((HR max \u2013 HR rest) x %Intensity) +\nHR rest\nMaking sure you are exercising in the\ncorrect THR zone will improve your\nprogression at that particular intensity\nand enable you to achieve maximal re-sults. It is also a good way of keeping\nyou on track and maintaining motivation to keep up your aerobic exercise\nsessions. The different exercise zones\nhelp specify the best THR for you to\ntrain in and therefore enhance your\nfitness.\nZone 60 \u2013 70% helps develop basic\nendurance and aerobic capacity. It can\nalso help you lose weight by fat burning\nwhich is when your fat provides some\nof the total energy you need to keep\ngoing. This is most beneficial when\nexercising for a duration of 40 minutes\nplus. The longer you exercise at this\nintensity the more fat you will use up\nfor energy. If the intensity of exercise\nis increased then the fat contribution\nwill decrease.\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 IC Netball 1st 10 10 0 0 521 282 239 100 50\n2 IC Tennis Women's 1st 10 9 1 0 76 23 53 90 47\n3 IC Squash Men's 1st 9 9 0 0 45 0 45 100 45\n4 IC Tennis Men's 2nd 10 9 0 1 74 26 48 90 41\n5 IC Rugby Union Men's 1st 11 9 0 2 250 112 138 82 37\n6 IC Hockey Men's 1st 10 7 1 2 34 19 15 70 29\n7 IC Squash Men's 2nd 9 7 0 2 30 15 15 78 27\n8 ICSM Netball 2nd 9 7 0 2 289 160 129 78 27\n9 IC Volleyball Men's 1st 7 6 0 1 12 3 9 86 26\n10 IC Volleyball Women's 1st 5 5 0 0 14 5 9 100 25\n11 IC Football Men's 1st 9 4 4 1 16 6 10 44 24\n12 IC Fencing Men's 2nd 6 5 0 1 761 660 101 83 21\n13 IC Fencing Women's 1st 7 5 0 2 899 735 164 71 17\n14 IC Rugby Union Men's 2nd 10 5 2 3 232 162 70 50 17\n15 IC Football Women's 1st 7 3 3 1 7 4 3 43 17\n16 ICSM Badminton Women's 1st 5 4 0 1 30 10 20 80 16\n17 ICSM Hockey Women's 1st 9 5 1 3 54 20 34 56 15\n18 ICSM Netball 1st 9 5 1 3 305 296 9 56 15\n19 IC Badminton Men's 1st 10 6 0 4 47 33 14 60 14\n20 ICSM Hockey Men's 2nd 10 6 0 4 28 24 4 60 14\n21 IC Lacrosse Women's 1st 8 5 0 3 78 50 28 63 13\n22 ICSM Football Men's 1st 8 3 3 2 13 12 1 38 13\n23 IC Table Tennis Women's 1st 6 4 0 2 17 11 6 67 12\n24 IC Hockey Men's 2nd 10 5 1 4 50 23 27 50 11\n25 IC Hockey Men's 3rd 10 5 1 4 18 17 1 50 11\n26 IC Waterpolo Men's 1st 2 2 0 0 17 14 3 100 10\n27 IC Netball 2nd 9 5 0 4 277 209 68 56 9\n28 IC Table Tennis Men's 1st 9 5 0 4 91 62 29 56 9\n29 IC Hockey Women's 1st 10 4 2 4 35 32 3 40 8\n30 IC Rugby Union Women's 1st 3 2 0 1 79 40 39 67 6\n31 ICSM Hockey Women's 2nd 10 3 3 4 30 42 -12 30 5\n32 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 3rd 8 4 0 4 202 148 54 50 4\n33 ICSM Hockey Men's 3rd 5 2 1 2 18 9 9 40 4\n34 IC Basketball Men's 1st 4 2 0 2 266 266 -20 50 2\n35 IC Squash Men's 3rd 4 2 0 2 8 4 4 50 2\n36 IC Badminton Men's 2nd 10 4 1 5 37 43 -6 40 2\n37 ICSM Hockey Men's 1st 10 4 1 5 22 35 -13 40 2\n38 IC Rugby Union Men's 3rd 9 4 0 5 165 147 18 44 0\n39 IC Fencing Men's 1st 7 3 0 4 817 798 19 43 -1\n40 IC Hockey Women's 2nd 10 3 2 5 13 39 -26 30 -1\n41 ICSM Hockey Women's 3rd 10 4 0 6 18 24 -6 40 -4\n42 IC Squash Women's 1st 7 2 1 4 12 16 -4 29 -4\n43 IC Hockey Men's 4th 9 3 0 6 13 22 -9 33 -9\n44 ICSM Netball 3rd 8 2 0 6 162 210 -48 25 -14\n45 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 1st 8 2 0 6 133 239 -106 25 -14\n46 ICSM Football Men's 2nd 5 0 1 4 9 17 -8 0 -14\n47 IC Tennis Men's 1st 10 2 1 7 36 64 -28 20 -16\n48 ICSM Rugby Union Men's 2nd 11 3 0 8 178 300 -122 27 -17\n49 IC Badminton Women's 1st 8 1 1 6 22 42 -20 13 -17\n50 ICSM Badminton Men's 1st 8 1 0 7 20 44 -24 13 -23\n51 IC Football Men's 3rd 10 1 1 8 14 35 -21 10 -25\n52 IC Football Men's 2nd 9 0 1 8 10 31 -21 0 -30\nACROSS\n1 Paid servant holds his teeth (8)\n5 Heartless impulse covers the poles\n(6)\n10 Measure around a crumbling\nbiscuit (7)\n11 Vernaculars back in flamboyant\nactor\u2019s chart (9)\n12 Mix up the back selection (9)\n13 Uprooted weeds stitched together\n(5)\n14 Carve in an English cemetery (7)\n16 Reginald threw in the towel for a\ntool (6)\n18 Extract ore from fluorides to make\nglasses or liquids (6)\n20 Violinist likes messing around (7)\n22 Hot chocolate with modified\ndisease-free tobacco (5)\n23 Fat cult prone to\nmisunderstandings (9)\n25 French punch (9)\n26 Endless cheek from a distorted\nanimal (5)\n27 As far as it goes, it was an old\nmarquee (6)\n28 Raw treat cut into pieces for\nmaritime rodent (5,3)\n1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8\n9\n10 11\n12 13\n14 15 16 15\n17\n17 18 19 20\n21 20\n22 23 24\n25 26\n27 28\nSolution to Crossword 1,393\nDOWN\n1 Judge will store information about\nthe queen (8)\n2 Shanghai bitterness comes up to\nthe bone (5)\n3 Incorporation of bizarre alien\ntransition (15)\n4 Improve on a coldless English\nchance (7)\n6 What\u2019s this?

Felix reports from Battlefield Imperial\nIn the past week a new poster campaign has been launched, almost un-noticed, on Imperial\u2019s South Kensington campus: a campaign, born from\nan underground internet movement,\nwhich has reached across the globe\nand broken out of its electronic form\nto create a publicity barrage in cities all\nover Europe and America.\nThe Sherfield Walkway is adorned\nwith many different adverts and publicity for our many societies and events,\nbut its most recent addition is for a\ncampaign symbolising a global protest\nagainst a \u2018religious\u2019 entity: the Church\nof Scientology. It calls for governments,\nmedia, organisations and individuals\nto destroy what it refers to as a \u201cvicious\norganisation which routinely uses legal\naction, defamation and assassination\nto silence those who speak out.\u201d The\nposters also urge students to become\npart of the \u201cAnonymous\u201d group and\njoin the London cell of the global anti-Scientology picket on 10th February in\nBlackfriars, where the UK Scientology\nheadquarters is based.\nOn 16th January global newspapers\nand media reported on the internet\nleak of a video showing Tom Cruise\ntalking about his Scientology beliefs,\ncoinciding with the publishing of an\nunauthorised biography of Mr Cruise\nby renowned biographer Andrew Morton. The embarrassing leaked video,\nset to the \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d theme\ntune and full of controversial quotes,\nwas posted on many news sites, but\nthen rapidly removed from most after\nthreats from the much-feared Scientology legal team.\nThese events and legal threats were\nseen as the \u2018final straw\u2019 for a community on 711Chan, one of the internet\u2019s\nmost notorious social forums, which\ninterpreted the move as an attempted\ncensorship, and the most recent in a\nseries of alleged \u201cunethical practices\u201d\npractisedbytheChurch.Theylaunched\na massive underground campaign \u201cdeclaring war\u201d on Scientology under the\nmoniker of \u201cAnonymous,\u201d (\u201cWe are\nAnonymous, We are Legion\u201d), issuing\nseveral Youtube messages to the world\nnews services.\nThe main focus of the campaign is\nthe worldwide picketing of Scientology\nbuildings on 10th February at 11am,\nhanding out flyers and information\nabout what \u201cAnonymous\u201d claims is the\ntrue face of Scientology.\nThis is only the most recent in a\nseries of incidents involving the controversial religion. Early last year saw\nrespected BBC investigative journalist John Sweeney losing his temper on\ncamera at a high-ranking member of\nthe Church of Scientology; a Panorama\nepisode exposing some of the more\nsinister aspects of the organisation;\nand much tense discussion amongst\njournalists, pundits and the public at\nlarge about the nature of Scientology.\nThe Church in turn has redoubled its\nefforts to become recognised as a bona\nfide religion in the UK, fight its ban\nin Germany, and improve its much-mocked public image.\nThese new developments, however,\nare newsworthy on several fronts.\nThe initiation of the \u201cAnonymous\u201d\ncampaign has tapped into a strong\nundercurrent of public mistrust and\nskepticism of the Church, and as\nmore people have begun to do a little research into the organisation that\nhas been parodied and pilloried in the\nmainstream media, many have become\nconcerned about the global intentions\nand actions of this powerful minority\nand its stranglehold over certain aspects of US society, most notably Hollywood. The protesters cite evidence of\nconspiracy, espionage, harassment and\nmanslaughter to justify their online attacks (denial of service and defacement\nof pro-scientology websites) and their\npicketing of the physical parts of the\nChurch.\nThe online movement has a real air\nof popular uprising against what is\ninterpreted as a suppressive, invasive,\nand greedy entity. It has the potential\nto become one of the first global, political campaigns to begin solely on\nthe internet amongst people who have\nnever met in real life.\nThe momentum that the campaign\nhas already gained is signified by its\nrapidappearanceatImperial:notorious\nfor its lethargy on most issues. Despite\nbeginning only two weeks previously,\non Monday there were already over 10\nposters along the Walkway alone, and\nmore over the rest of campus. Some\nhave been removed since, by parties\nunknown (although many people have\nbrought them to various officers of the\nUnion), but the posters have not gone\ncompletely unnoticed and more are expected over the coming weeks.\nFelix has talked to several students\nwho are already members of \u201cAnonymous,\u201d and all are preparing for 10th\nFebruary and the surrounding events,\nbut none have admitted to being the\noriginators of the physical publicity.\nWhat becomes of the campaign is\nstill to be determined. Opinion is divided over whether it will fizzle out like\nmany other internet fads, or stay for\nlong enough to make a difference and\nput a dent in the previously indomina-ble Church of Scientology.\nThe public eye, however, is clearly\nwatching this standoff between a \u2018religion\u2019 and an \u2018anonymous\u2019 group of\nonline troublemakers.\nScience Challenge Awards\nCeremony location unveiled\nO\nn Tuesday night, RCSU\nScience Challenge organiser Daniel Burrows\nfinally revealed that the\nawardsceremonywould\ntake place in the Science Museum\u2019s\nIMAX Theatre. The IMAX Theatre\nstands taller than four double deckers\nand measures wider than my mum.\nThere will also be a black tie reception in the Science Museum\u2019s Energy\nHall afterwards.\nEntrants are required to attend the\nawards ceremony on Tuesday 18th\nMarch if they want a chance of winning\nthe \u00a32,500 first prize along with an Apple Macbook, the latter of which was\nrevealed to be an additional prize on\nAndrew Somerville\nDeputy & News Editor\nNext stop, Beit Quadrangle?\nThe bus stand currently outside the Holy Trinity Church\nTuesday. Similarly, people who signed\nup to the mailing list to win a Wii must\nalso attend the final evening.\nSir Brian Hoskins gave his seminar\non Tuesday night too; his question be-ing: \u201cTo what extent is geoengineer-ing the solution to the climate change\nproblem?\u201d Sir Brian\u2019s talk was clearly\nand concisely delivered in this reporter\u2019s eyes and anyone who missed the\npresentation is advised to download\nand watch it by heading to www.rscu.\norg.uk/sciencechallenge.\nNext week, seminars will be given by\nDr Paul Snaith and Dr Philip Campbell.\nLord Robert Winston will be presenting on the following Tuesday. Seminars\ntake place in MechEng 220 at 6:30pm.\nThe Challenge will be held at the Science Museum\u2019s IMAX Theatre\nTom Roberts\nEditor-in-Chief\nThe archway to Beit Quadrangle could\nbecome a shelter for people hiding\nfrom the rain whilst they wait for a bus\ndepending on the outcome of a Prince\nConsort Road bus stop implementation scheme.\nWestminster City Council (WCC) is\nmaking changes to two of its bus routes\nin the area: 360 and 70. The original\nplans proposed involve the lifting of\nthe right hand turn ban for buses turning onto Exhibition Road as well as the\ninstallation of a new bus stop directly\noutside the archway entrance of Beit\nQuad.\nSince the plans were proposed, WCC\nhas received letters from residents in\nthe area and the Union has also been\nin contact to express its dismay with\nthe plans.\nThe entrance to Beit Quad is a major thoroughfare for students plus it\nis only metres away from a pedestrian\ncrossing. Furthermore, clubs and societies often park minibuses outside the\narchway entrance before heading off\nfor fixtures and tours.\nThe proposals have left residents\nscratching their heads and wondering\nwhy the bus stand currently in place\noutside the Holy Trinity Church \u2013 next\ndoor to Beit Quad \u2013 can\u2019t be converted\ninto a bus stop.\nFelix contacted West One Project\nEngineer, Guy McNamara, who is in\ncharge of the implementation scheme\nfor more information.\nMr McNamara said that he had received a number of letters from people\nin the area and that he had been contacted by Imperial College about the\nproposals. The plans are being reconsidered with the possibility of moving\nthe bus stop 15m down the road towards the Royal Albert Hall. Whether\nthe management of the Royal Albert\nHall agrees to the revisions remains to\nbe seen.\nThe bus stop was originally scheduled to be finished by 5th February.\nOnce completed, Beit Hall residents\ncan expect to roll out of bed, onto a\nbus and end up in Elephant And Castle\nor perhaps Acton. If they\u2019re that way\ninclined.\nOne of three \u201cAnonymous\u201d group posters on the Sherfield Walkway\n\n"

With a mini SD slot\nyou can load it up with 2GB of you\nfavourite music and videos, not a lot I\nknow but it'll make those bus or tube\njourneys in and out of Uni fly by without getting bored. However, internet\naccess is where it begins to fall down.\nUnlike it's main Nokia competitors,\nit does not have Wifi built in. This is\nnot a major issue for most people but\nas wireless internet hotspots expand,\nmore people want to be able to get\nfree internet on their phones. On the\nup side, if you get this phone on Vodafone you can use Vodafone Live to read\nall the latest news headlines and keep\ntrack of sports results for free.\nMy main niggle with this phone is\nthe time delay which almost seems to\nhave been put in on purpose. Many a\ntime I have to wait for the phone's underpowered processor to get around to\nworking out what button I just pressed\nand then finally show the menu I was\nexpecting. I'm really hoping that a future firmware update will speed things\nup. Other people have told me of concerns about the soft touch buttons on\nthe screen being too sensitive, so you\ncan press them by accident. All I can\nsay is that I have found no problem\nwith them and if you get one of these\nphones, you will soon be joyfully hammering the screens of every other\nphone wondering why nothing is happening (yes I have done this).\nOverall, once you get used to this\nphone, I would say it's one of the best\non the market as long as mobile internet access isn't an issue. The new\nbutton layout allows for a significantly\nlarger screen and the lack of moving\nparts makes it highly durable, coupled\nwith a new, more protective camera\nlens design.\nMore camera than phone\nDavid Lawrence explains why his camera, I mean phone, is better than yours\nNokia N95 - Anything you can do, I can do better\nThis an expensive specialised Home Theatre PC (HTPC), but you can use any old PC for the job\nvideo and so keeps the PC stable and\nensures the recording doesn\u2019t skip. You\ncould upgrade the graphics card and\nhave a monumental gaming PC setup\nor just shove a load of hard-drives in\nand keep your entire media collection\non the single PC. There\u2019s plenty of cases to choose from, so you might want\nto pick a slimline system for sitting by\nyour TV. These systems can be found\npre-built on the high street for around\n\u00a3500 and upwards, but as mentioned,\nit can be fairly easy to upgrade your\nown system up to scratch.\nSo, does your box already have what\nit takes? You need to look out for a\ngraphics card with a DVI output. These\ncan be picked up for around \u00a330 and\nare a simple upgrade for any PC, you\nmay already have one! Then a simple\nDVI->HDMI cable will connect your\nPC to your TV, these are a few quid\nonline or \u00a315+ on the high street. Now\nyour PC and TV are hooked up there\u2019s\none final stage, the TV resolution. If\nyou have a 720p / 1080i TV you want\nto set your resolution to 1360x768, if\nyou have managed to get a 1080p TV\nthen crank it all the way to 1920x1080.\nThe only thing that this setup lacks is\nthe inclusion of an HD media drive,\nwhich currently aren\u2019t at the most\nstudent-friendly price point. There are\nHD-DVD, Blu-ray and combination\ndrives available, starting at \u00a3100 and\nthe purchase of one of these will allow\nyou to buy all those HD movies on the\nhigh street.\nOnce your hardware is chosen, purchased and loosely assembled with a\nhot glue-gun it\u2019s time to choose the\nsoftware. There are loads of choices for\nmedia centre software, ranging from\nthose that cost you money, to those\nthat are absolutely free. Microsoft\ncreated Windows XP Media Centre\nEdition for exactly this purpose, with\nbuilt in TV-tuner management and\nmedia library functions that can easily be controlled by a remote. This is a\ngreat choice if your PC already has it\npre-loaded, if not then Windows Vista\n(Home Premium & Ultimate) comes\nwith the Media Centre as well. Then\nthere\u2019s MythTV, a customized Linux\ndistribution that comes with TV-tuner\nsupport and media centre software rivalling Microsoft\u2019s system. This does\nturn your box into a Linux box how-ever, so take note that although free,\nyou may lose gaming functionality or\ngeneral software compatibility.\nThe alternative setup is to use one\nof the current generations of console.\nBoth the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 have media-centre functionality.\nSimply pick up the console, purchase\nan HD connection for it (this will be\ncomponent or HDMI, costing around\n\u00a315) and plug it in. The Xbox 360 communicates with any XP or Vista machines on the network and functions as\na \u201cmedia extender\u201d. Simply put, it will\nconnect to the media library on any PC\nand stream content over the network,\nallowing you to watch DVDs and game\non the console and any other media\n(such as DivX video) from your desktop PC. The addition of an HD-DVD\ndrive (approx. \u00a3100) or the possible\nBlu-ray player for the 360 will get you\nfully prepared for the high-def age.\nA PS3 will give you a fully featured\nBlu-ray player by default as well as providing some amazing quality high-def-inition games to get started on the new\nsetup. Sony are improving the media\nfunctionality for the PS3 as time pass-es. At the moment it can play a decent\npercentage of non-high-definition media files from both the audio and video\nsides of the spectrum. Another nifty\nfeature is the PS3\u2019s ability to browse\nthe internet. This is something it has\nin common with its Japanese brother,\nthe Wii. So if you prefer to browse the\nNet from the luxury of your sofa you\ncan. Using the same feature set the PS3\ncan also play media which has been attached to it in the form of an external\nUSB hard disk, so you can duplicate\nyour media and watch them on the PS3\nin a much more social setting.\nIn the end all this equipment starts\nto mount up, but we think that you can\nput together a very versatile and impressive home-theatre setup for under\na grand. So if you split this between a\nfew flatmates, you may not be as far\nout of pocket as you had thought.\n\n"

You can still give your opinion on the debate: www.imperialcollegeunion.org/hesurvey\nSteve Brown\nUnion President\nWhy a referendum is inappropriate\nLet us know your views: comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nLetters may be edited for length and grammar purposes\nViews on these pages are not representative of Felix\nA\nUnion consultation of\nstudents as to whether\na university education\nshould be free was hardly\ngoing to produce interesting results. The exercise seems to me\nto be akin to asking turkeys whether\nChristmas is a great idea. Irrespective of the economic and social argu-ments, I would much prefer someone\nelse to pay for my education. And a\nhouse would be nice. Also, a Mercedes,\nplease. Thanks.\nThe problem, as I see it, is that the\nquestion hasn\u2019t been well posed. People have been asking whether a university education should be free, but it\nhas to be paid for somehow. Lecturers\nand tutors will not work for free, and\nthe equipment needed for a science\nuniversity is certainly expensive. The\nquestion is, should the British taxpayer\npay for us to have a university educa-tion? Free university education would\nbe fantastic for university students, but\nwould it be good for the millions on\nlow wages who would be paying for it?\nThere are good arguments for widespread university education, just as\nthere are good arguments for universal health care. A high level of education would improve our economy and\nit would also increase social mobility,\nsomething it is impossible to object\nto. But it separates the benefit from\nthe payment. Of course dustbin men\nwould benefit from other people having a university education, building up\nthe economy, supporting more jobs\nand spending more. But they\u2019d benefit\nmore directly from lower taxes.\nOn the other hand, a system with individual payment and individual pricing for courses would result in better\nfunding, and even better funding for\nuniversities that command a reputation\n(c.f. the U.S., where prices range from\n$8k to $35k p.a.). It would encourage\npeople to actually trade off the value of\ntheir education against their expected\nbenefits. I hope it would encourage\nmore flexible studies; for example, doing a one-year course on server maintenance and operating systems, rather\nthan a three-year computing course. It\nwould also shut the media up about so\ncalled \u201cmedia studies\u201d-type degrees, as\nthe market would decide their worth.\nIt would also have the advantage of not\ncharging people for something they\nweren\u2019t benefiting from.\nOf course, it comes hand in hand\nwith the risk of excluding low-income\nfamilies. But our current system does\nthat, by driving people into debt (albeit\nat inflation rates), while having the side\neffect of transferring money from the\nstate to middle-class tossers such as\nmyself. A better system would be to require individual payment with means-tested grants for those who need it. A\nsystem exploiting market forces with\nstate intervention to cushion the blow\nand ensure social mobility would be\nfair for wealthy and poor students. It\u2019s\neven fair to the dustmen.\nFree for whom?\nRobert Gallen\nI have just completed the Higher\nEducation Funding Survey and\nhopefully let the Union know my\nposition on the subject. However, I imagine that based on the\nanswers that I gave, my position\nwill certainly be contradictory and\nconfused.\nMany of the issues addressed in\nthe survey I, and no doubt many\nother Imperial students, have not\ngiven much consideration before.\nNor could we possibly claim to be\neducated on the topic.\nI am extremely interested to see\nthe results of the survey and how\nthe Union interprets them, however I feel if there was one message that most Imperial students\nwould like to send to the Union,\nit\u2019s that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to pay\u201d. As\nuneducated or misinformed we\nare on the matter, it still falls to us\nto pay off the mountain of debt we\nare to be burdened with when we\nleave university.\nKadhim Shubber\nHE funding\nsurvey: a case\nof the blind\nleading the\nblind?\nI\nunderstand the concerns expressed in last weeks issue about\nour survey not being as binding\nas a campus wide referendum on\nthis topic. I would like to reassure readers that the raw data we have\ncollected will be made available in full\nshould anyone wish to scrutinise it. At\nthis point I imagine it would become\nobvious if the Deputy President (Edu-cation and Welfare) and I were being a\nbit \u201ccreative\u201d in our interpretations of\nthe data and if Ms. Clark still doesn\u2019t\ntrust us then there are lots of wonderful democratic mechanisms in place to\nprevent us doing so. I seem to recall\ndealing with the question of putting\nthis to a referendum last term so to illustrate why the topic of how our universities are funded please consider the\nconsequences of a campus wide \u201cyes\u201d\nvote in favour of free education. Under our electoral rules questions put to\nreferenda must be clear cut and have a\n\u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer which I hope people will agree is an inappropriate and\noverly simplistic mechanism for a topic\nwhich touches on so many different areas of our student experience.\nFirst of all, \u201cfree education\u201d is not\neven on the agenda in the run up to\nthe 2009 review. This is not the position of the Labour and Conservative\nparties who are the only ones that will\nrealistically form the next government\nand even the dear old Liberal Democrats are allegedly contemplating moving away from their current position\nof opposing all methods of graduate\ncontribution. The socialist Labour\nParty has made it perfectly clear that\nthey would not increase taxes to fill\nthe funding gap and if you believe this\nshould happen (in my view I don\u2019t really want to start work next year and be\ntaxed through the nose) then you will\nneed to take considerably more drastic\naction than ticking a few boxes on an\nonline form.\nEqually ridiculous is the concept\nthat any government will turn round\nand say \u201cactually, we are going to shut\ndown several underperforming institutions and give all their funding to Imperial College.\u201d The diverse nature of\nthe higher education sector does mean\nthat some sections of it will be of more\nuse than others but this problem will\nnot be solved overnight by the implementation of a reactionary policy such\nas this which in a lot of cases would see\nsociety throwing the baby out with the\nbathwater. In time, the introduction\nof the correct market mechanisms for\nteaching funding would act as a selection process in itself and would determine exactly how much students,\nemployers and society value different\ntypes of degree courses. Imperial\u2019s degrees are very expensive to teach compared to the costs of teaching the same\nsubject elsewhere but this is not currently reflected in the way the government allocates teaching money.\nFrom the thousands of words generated on this topic this year in my view\nit is obvious that this is far too complicated to be settled by a referendum and\nit would be detrimental to our Union\nto formulate such an important policy\nin this way. A referendum was a good\nway to determine whether or not we\nshould affiliate to the National Union\nof Students (NUS) as it was a clear cut\nissue. For your information, the NUS\ncurrently don\u2019t believe that Imperial College should have the freedom\nto set their own bursary packages for\nless well off over and above the government minimums and that our students should be forced to pay in to a\nNational Bursary Scheme that would\nsee the contributions we make spent\nat other universities. This is another\ntopic in itself so I will finish by urging\nyou to get online, take the survey and\ngive yourself a chance of winning one\nof the prizes on offer!\nGeneric Student: \u201cI\u2019ll have a Mercedes to go with my free education!\u201d\nComplete the HE survey, win prizes!\nFill out the survey at www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote and if there\nare enough responses, you could win from the following:\n0 responses = Return ticket to Paris on Eurostar\n150 responses = West End theatre and dinner voucher for two\n300 responses = Thorpe Park tickets for two\n500 responses = Crystal Experience gift voucher for one\n750 responses = 3 x \u00a320 HMV vouchers\n1000 responses = 5 x \u00a310 ODEON Cinema vouchers\n\n"
