We started writing\nan open letter to the College, but were\ntold at a meeting with Martin Lupton,\nthe head of Undergraduate Medicine,\nthat the decision to change the 4-year\nprogram had already be made, and\nwould not be changed,\u201d says Sophie\nWilliams, a irst year student on the\nfour year programme.\nhe College held a consultation\nlast year about changes to the course,\nin which students suggested more\nsupport for research could be made\navailable.\nA College Spokesperson said, \u201cA\nformal review of the four year degree\nin 2012, which drew on feedback\nfrom students and staf, found that\nin its current form the compact and\nintensive programme does not meet\nexpectations in providing suicient\nopportunities for research and\nscholarship.\u201d\n\u201cAt the time, students were not told\nabout possible changes to the length\nof the course,\u201d said Williams. \u201cAnd, no\nfurther consultation was made about\nthe changes with students or staf.\u201d\nhe current four-year course has\nvarious Government tuition fees\nloans and NHS bursaries; however\nit\u2019s unclear if students can access\nthese loans and funding on the 5-year\ncourse.

Some of us more alive\nthan the rest.\nOn a side note being dragged out of\nbed at 8 in the morning after 3 hours\nsleep to play cricket because \u2018\u2018we\u2019re\nshort\u2019\u2019 is not fun or pleasant so cheers\nDave.\nhis whole tournament was\norganised by UCL who were so keen\nthey decided to buy a horrendous\nlooking purple T20 kit just to try and\nput out that they were a dominant side.\nAlso they had to be a pain because of it\nand bowl with a white ball.\nmatch 1: ICUCC vs UCl\nAfter winning the toss ICUCC decided\nto bat irst. Vishal and Hemant opened\nthe batting, however both managed to\nlose their wickets cheaply: Vishal to a\nspectacular catch at slip and Hemant\nbeing bowled out. Sam also managed\nto lose his wicket fairly cheaply for 5.\nWhich left it to Viggy and Karan to\nrebuild the innings aided by the help\nof what was probably two of the worst\numpires that have ever existed. hey\nwere probably taught the rules the\nmorning of the match.\nKaran was stumped at least 3 times\nand run out twice, all of which was\ngiven not out. hey also struggled\nto count and would constantly get\nthe numbers ive and six confused.\nHowever Viggy eventually lost his\nwicket to an attempted big haul over\nmid of. In came Arjun, who also lost\nhis wicket fairly cheaply, and Huzaifah\nessentially went straight back after\nwalking in due to some horrendous\ncalling by Karan.\nKaran eventually lost his wicket at a\npoint were we really didn\u2019t have much\non the board. But a last ditch cameo\nfrom Dave, Tom and Shaneil (mostly\nDave) left us with a semi respectable\nscore of 112.\nIn reply UCL started with a\ndiamond duck with their opener\nnicking behind. A constant stream of\nwickets meant that UCL were under\nconstant pressure and Imperial looked\non course for a simple victory. But\nthe umpires simply couldn\u2019t let this\nhappen which led them to give UCL a\nsix point penalty for Imperial having a\nslow over rate.\nDrama emerged in the inal over in\nwhich UCL required 5 runs in the last\nover but the umpires managed to cock\nup their counting again, claiming that\nUCL required two of the last ball. his\nsent UCL into uproar causing them to\nsprint onto the pitch with a scorebook\nto argue. Eventually the umpires gave\nin depite Viggy\u2019s protest. However\nsome excellent death bowling by\nShival meant that Imperial could hang\non for the win.\nBatting igures:\nViggy: 36\nDave : 21\nKaran: 18\nBowling Figures:\nShaneil: 4-0-18-2\nTom: 4-0-18-2\nViggy: 4-0-22-2\nmatch 2: ICUCC vs kings\nKings managed to see of LSE,\ncomfortably scoring 217-1 with one of\ntheir openers scoring a hundred odd.\nWinning the toss again Imperial put\nKings into bat. Kings got of to a lying\nstart scoring 56 of of the irst four\novers. his did involve Dave getting\nbored so he decided it would be more\nfun to bowl to irst slip rather than\nthe batsman on numerous occasions\nand ended up bowling 18 balls for\ntwo overs. Furthermore, because it\nwas obvious that Imperial were going\nto win Karan decided to drop both\nopeners early on just to make the\ngame seem more interesting.\nEventually ICUCC managed to\ndismiss the top three and then we\nwere well and truly into the tail. Dave\nmanaged to get the crowd on his side\nby taking a spectacular one handed\ncatch on the boundary and then\nproceeding to down a can given to\nhim, leading to everyone chanting his\nname.\nImperial eventually managed to\nrestrict Kings to 126. Special mention\nto Tom for bowling an excellent spell\ntaking four wickets for nine runs.\nIn reply Imperial got of to a\nsolid start with a strong opening\npartnership of 61 which included a\ncool, calm and collected half century\nby Vishal whilst Hemant just stood\nby and watched. Both eventually lost\ntheir wicket which brought in Viggy\nand Sam.\nSam however also lost his wicket\ncheaply which brought in crowd\nfavourite ENNY Scott (Dave), who\npleased the crowd by smashing it\nround the park and taking us home.\nBatting Figures:\nVishal: 54\nDave: 38\nViggy: 28\nBowling Figures:\nTom: 4-0-9-4\nViggy: 4-0-11-2\nDave: 4-0-30-1\nAttack of the Stormtroopers \u2013 London Cricket Varsity 2014\nkaran Dhall\nImperial Cricket\nIC CRICkET\nOn a day in which the Weather Gods\ninally answered Arvind Rajagopalan\u2019s\nnightly prayers and granted us a day\nof fun in the sun, seconds skipper\nSamuel Mead led ICUCC onto the\npitch for our irst ever Varsity match\nagainst the Medics seconds at Regents\nPark. Based on some sneaky insider\ninformation, sent to him the night\nbefore by Arvind, Sam elected to ield\nirst. Imperial was chomping at the\nbit, ready to sink our teeth into the\nstar-studded Medics batting line up\nfeaturing two of their 1st XI batsmen,\nthe opener being the 1st XI Captain,\nthe mighty Mrigank Sinha.\nNick Young was right on the money\nfrom ball one, keeping Mrigank irmly\non the back foot by making good use\nof the bouncy astroturf wicket. Sam\nMead at the other end proceeded to\nbowl the worst opening spell in recent\nhistory. hankfully, it turned out\nSam Mead had also led us out onto\nthe wrong pitch (a U15 pitch), and\ntherefore very \u2018graciously\u2019 ofered to\nrestart the match, since the Medics\nwere concerned that they had only\nscored one boundary of the opening\nive overs.\nHaving restarted the match, Sam\ninally decided to pack his leg side\nield and bowl, which turned out to\nbe a masterstroke since he was intent\non bowling Big G Bodyline, only a\nlittle slower and less threatening.\nSoon a mini battle ensued between\nMrigank and Arvind at point, putting\non a virtuoso ielding performance by\nstopping nearly every one of Mrigank\u2019s\nshots through that region without\neven using his hands. Sam, having\ninally realised the plan, brought in\nthe dangerous Mak Gill and set the\nstraight ielders deep. With the point-cover region taken out of the equation\nby Arvind\u2019s massive behind and Nick\u2019s\nexcellent long barrier, Mrigank had no\nchoice but to loft one straight, which\nwas calmly collected at long on by\nArjun Jayaswal.\nWith Mak having been removed by\none of the two specialist batsmen in\nthe Medic line up, IC upped the ante to\ntry and roll the Medics over for a sub-par score. More tidy bowling by Mak\ndelivered him the scalp of the second\nopener, who had the distinction of\nbeing clean bowled twice in the same\nday. Mak inished with solid igures of\n2-16, removing the set batsmen. From\nthe other end, Arvind was unlucky not\nto pick up a wicket with his eclectic\nmix of leggies, googlies and sliders,\nseeing as Huzaifah behind the stumps\nhad not quite gotten his act together\nyet, missing a few tough stumping\nchances. Former IC seconds stalwart\nYash Verma somehow managed\nto survive a monstrous over from\nArvind, which ended up going for just\none.\nHaving decided the game was\nmeandering along for far too long,\nSam brought on team mascot Hemant\n\u201cHabib Habibu\u201d Morjaria, the man\nwith the golden arm of late, who\ninstantly brought Huzaifah back into\nthe game with two stumpings in two\nballs, one of them being the dangerous\nJai Patel.\nFrom the other end, \u201cBig Ben\u201d\nStockton proved that sometimes\nheight is all you need, giving the Medic\nbatsmen some sweet chin music of a\nive step run-up.\nAseem Sharma (aka \u201ctraitor\u201d)\nwas the beneiciary of most of this\nhostility. Hemant managed to prise\nout two more Medic batsmen (with a\nthird stumping for Huzaifah), but was\ndenied a ive-for by Sam. With Ben\u2019s\nwicket inally getting IC into the tail,\nSam decided to unleash our secret\nweapon, Luke Gardner.\nLuke proceeded to prove just how\nquick he had become, sacriicing\nline, length and the pitch for pure,\nbrutal pace. He proceeded to give up\n20 runs before some timely words\nfrom Arvind resulted in his maiden\nwicket for IC, a fact which was not\nlost on anyone when Luke went for\nan ecstatic gambol around the pitch.\nArvind inally contributed to the\nwickets column, running out the\nMedic\u2019s seconds Captain, setting IC a\ntricky target of the nelson, 111, in 20\novers.\nWith darkness threatening to\nbring an early end to the day\u2019s play,\nImperial openers Hemant and Big\nSam Dethridge proceeded to cut into\nthe Medics bowling. he irst 10 overs\nwere negotiated quite comfortably.\nDespite the early hiccup, Hemant\ncontinued in his ine vein of form,\nbefore falling caught-and-bowled to\nMedics legspinner Samad Wahid. In\nwalked Arjun Jayaswal, signalling his\nmurderous intent early by arriving\nwithout a helmet. It seemed the\nMedics took the philosophy of caring\nfor your fellow man quite literally,\nrefusing to bowl at the stumps for fear\nof causing injury, resulting in a very\ncharitable dose of extras and cutting\ndown our target by a good third. Luke\n\u201cSkywalker\u201d Gardner very astutely\npredicted that the Medic bowlers\nwould manage a better run-rate than\ntheir batsmen did, as turned out to\nbe the case. Arjun eventually fell\nto Medics skipper Jonny Wise for a\nquickire 18 of six balls, killing what\nlittle hopes the medics had left. Fahad\nAli, the \u201cMedic with a mouth\u201d was\nnot shy with his atrocious sledging,\nbut even his own team could not take\nsomeone playing in a white tank top\nand black trousers seriously. As for\nus, we were wondering when PB had\nstarted playing for the Medics (yes,\nthe sledging was of THAT quality).\nWith Huzaifah walking in at no. 4,\nSam entrenched at that other end and\nonly nine runs left to knock of, the\nonly real problem left for IC was that\nHuzaifah did not have enough runs\nleft to get to leave contented. With the\nlast ball of an excellent Yash Verma\n(who really should have been brought\non earlier) over to face, Huzaifah\nunfortunately could not build on a\ngood day behind the stumps, playing\nall around an in-dipper, leaving for a\ngolden duck to the plumbest of plumb\nLBWs. He was later quoted as saying\n\u201cI was so eager for a single to keep\nstrike that I missed the ball.\u201d\nhankfully, Big Sam Dethridge\nrealised the danger of leaving any runs\nfor the skipper, and promptly clubbed\ntwo boundaries to inish of the game,\ngiving IC a resounding win.\nImperial 2nds mercilessly destroy the Medics in Varsity\nluke gardner\nImperial Cricket\n\n"

Lead researcher,\nOliver Pike, is currently a PhD\nstudent, and was the irst to coin the\nidea. After completing a degree in\nNatural Sciences at Cambridge, he\njoined Imperial in 2011, to pursue\nhis doctorate in high energy density\nphysics.\nInertial coninement fusion (ICF)\nenergy research, a particular branch\nof research that studies some of the\nprocesses behind at nuclear power,\nprovided the inspiration for Pike\u2019s\ndiscovery: \u201cWe were looking into\nwhether the facilities used in ICF\ncould be used to study fundamental\nphysics, initially on scrap paper using\nsimple order of magnitude estimates.\nWithin a few hours it was clear they\ncould provide the perfect conditions\nfor creating a photon collider. Our\nphoton collider could create electrons\n(and their antiparticle, positrons)\nfrom light with today's lasers.\u201d\nWith ICF equipment already using\npowerful lasers to heat and compress\npellets to induce nuclear reactions,\nPike\u2019s idea was to remove the pellets\nand direct the lasers to collide together\ninstead.\nHowever, it could take some time\nto produce tangible results. Pike\ntold us, \u201cPredicting exactly when the\nexperiment will take place is very\ndiicult.\nhere's no guarantee that it will be\ndone within the next year, but we are\nhopeful the Breit-Wheeler process\nwill be observed very soon.\u201d\nFelix spoke to Professor Roland\nSmith, Head of Plasma Physics at\nImperial about the new research, and\nwhat it was like to be in the eye of the\nmedia storm surrounding the story:\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a pleasure to see how\nsmart some of your colleagues are\nand to have this recognised with high\nproile publications and (a brief) place\nin the spotlight.\u201d\n\u201cHigh proile results of this kind are\ncollected by Heads of Department\nand College monthly. his paper was\nreported on the BBC news online\nwebsite, he Guardian, he Daily\nMail, he Telegraph, the LA Times\nand the Times of India, the world's\nlargest circulation English-language\nbroadsheet. he story featured on the\nfront page of he Guardian\u2019s website\n(where it was one of their top 10 most\npopular stories) and the BBC News\nwebsite.\n[his subject] is a double edged\nsword however \u2013 it's an exciting\nidea with a strong popular cultural\nresonance. he paper describes a\nprocess that can be summarised as\n\u201clight in, matter out,\u201d (true \u2013 under\nextreme conditions) but some people\nwill automatically assume this leads\nto a Star Trek \u201cHolodeck\u201d \u2013 which is\nvery false!\u201d\nOn that idea that this technology\nmay soon be used to create large\namounts of matter from light, Pike\nsaid, \u201chere currently isn't enough\nenergy to make heavier particles. Even\nif this were possible, these would be\ncreated in such low numbers and at\nsuch high energies that they would not\nbe an 'object'. Most likely some kind of\nelectron-positron plasma (like that in\nthe early universe) would be formed.\u201d\nProfessor Smith continued, \u201cCan we\nfollow this up with a real experiment?\nNot on site at Imperial I am afraid,\nthere are only one or two labs in the\nworld with the right capabilities at the\nmoment.

Air pollution has previously\nbeen linked to an increased risk of\ncardiovascular and respiratory disease,\nas well as cancer. An estimated 7\nmillion deaths per year are a result of\nair pollution exposure according to the\nWorld Health Organisation.\nNewly published research links\nshort-term air pollution to an\nincreased risk of atrial ibrillation\n(irregular heartbeat) and pulmonary\nembolism (blood clot in the lungs).\nhe research team, from the\nLondon School of Hygiene & Tropical\nMedicine, used national databases\nin England and Wales to correlate\nincidence of cardiovascular disease\nwith local levels of air pollutant.\nhese databases recorded statistics\non hospital admissions for heart\nattack, stroke and other emergency\nadmissions. Air pollutants levels\nwere measured using data from local\nair quality monitoring stations; these\nincluded: carbon monoxide, nitrogen\ndioxide, particulate matter, sulphur\ndioxide and ozone.\nhe level of PM2.5, a type of\nparticulate matter, was strongly linked\nto an increased risk of atrial ibrillation\nand pulmonary embolism. here\nwas, however, no clear link between\nair pollutants and cardiovascular\ndeath (from heart attack or stroke).\nNitrogen dioxide exposure was linked\nto increased hospital admissions for\ncardiovascular problems, including\nheart failure, as well as a particular\ntype of heart attack (non-ST\nelevation). he researchers conclude\nthat there is no clear evidence that\nshort-term exposure to air pollution\nincreases risk of heart attack or stroke.\nStroke and heart attack are the well-known \u2018killers\u2019, but atrial ibrillation\nand pulmonary embolism are also\nserious conditions. Atrial ibrillation\nputs you at an increased risk of\nstroke, and pulmonary embolism is a\npotentially life-threatening condition,\nwhich can cause collapse and death.\nElderly patients and those with\npre-existing heart conditions are at\nincreased risk of developing serious\ncomplications.\nhis study has helped to provide\nfurther evidence on the adverse efects\nof air pollution on health.

Basically you\nwill not only get your iMessages on\nyour mac, but also actual mms and\nsms. his will make Messages quite a\nbit more useful, and helpful in terms\nof keeping all your information in one\nplace. However, the thing that really\nintrigued me is the fact that you can\nnow make and receive calls on your\nmac. If your mac is connected to the\nsame Wii network as your iPhone,\nthen when your receives a call, you\nget a notiication on your mac and\nare several features that are really\ninteresting.\nFirstly, the new messaging app,\nwhich looks to jump on the wave\nof new messaging methods. Apple\nhave introduced a handy new way of\nsharing their location, pictures and\nvideos, as well as generally making it\nfeel more whatsapp-y.\nSecondly, Apple have now\nintroduced a new app, HealthKit,\nwhich will collate all available health\ndata from other apps and gadgets, and\nperhaps in the future predict when\nyou may need to go to the hospital..\nhis points to Apple releasing some\nkind of gadget that will tie in with\nthis, perhaps a smartwatch? One\nI\nt is now summer (for most of\nus at least!). If you have nothing\nlined up for you, and would like\nto learn something new or do\nsomething productive, why not\nconsider learning how to program?\nHave you ever tried to rename\nhundreds of files, or tried to\norganise some data files with\nthousands of entries by hand? If\nyou have, you would know that the\ntask is arduous and tedious, and you\nwould be better off automating it.\nProgramming can allow to do that,\nand you spend less time in front\nof the computer, and more time in\nthe sunshine! (Or at least that\u2019s the\ntheory)\nLearning to program can improve\nyour logical thinking skills. While\nsome algorithm to sort numbers\nmay sound easy to comprehend, it\nis a different matter when you sit\ndown and try to implement it. You\nwould also be more appreciative of\nthe work that programmers put in\nwhen you use software, or when you\nencounter some bugs.\nThere is an adage saying that\neveryone can be a programmer,\nand then there is another camp\nthat says that not everyone can\nbe a programmer. People argue,\nwith the backing of studies that\nshows that a consistently high\npercentage of students fail their\nprogramming courses at University,\nthat not everyone is cut out to be\na programmer. On the other hand,\nthere are educators that attribute the\nfailures to the way programming is\ntaught, and that everyone can learn\nto program if taught properly. In this\nauthor\u2019s humble opinion, everyone\nshould just give programming a try\nfirst before they raise their hands in\nthe air and give up.\nI\nn recent times I have become\nquite disillusioned with Apple.\nhe keynotes were kinda boring,\nand there was nothing really\ninteresting. I usually tuned in to\nthe keynotes just because I felt that I\nshould. In fact, it got to the point that\nthis time around, I almost missed the\nkeynote. When I did open the stream,\nI found I had missed out completely\non the new OS X presentation,\nnamed Yosemite, but just managed to\ncatch iOS 8.\nI was immediately surprised by the\nlightness of the talk, I mean one of\nthe jokes was about a mad hairdresser\nruining Craig Federighi\u2019s hairdo.\nInstantaneously I was paying more\nattention than I had in the previous\nthree keynotes. Furthermore, there\nwere actual moments in the keynote\nwhere I sat up and said, wow that\nis pretty cool. I have not had that\nsince the iPhone 4 release! So here is\nthe low down on the two big things\nrelease:\nhe big thing about OS X Yosemite\nis a closer alignment with iOS and\nmobile, thus tying its users more\nclosely into the Apple eco system.\nFirstly, there is a redesign of all the\nicons, more in style of iOS 7. he\nOS X, iOS and full-frontal Apple\nthen it can act as a speaker for your\nphone. I ind this a really cool feature,\nespecially since I am someone who\ntends to leave my phone somewhere\nand then lay down somewhere else,\noften getting to lazy to get up again.\nWhile this step is more evolutionary\nthan revolutionary (I feel I have\napplied this clich\u00e9 quite a few times\nto Apple releases) it is a really positive\nevolution, and I welcome more like it.\nWhile iOS 7 was a real game\nchanger in terms of iOS, 8 continues\nthat revolution in great style. here\nthing that did come about from the\nHealthKit announcement was the\nnaming debacle. Another company\nwhich does something similar to the\napp, already has that name, twitter\nhandle and website. herefore you\nmay see a name change.\nhe last feature that really\ninterested me is Apple\u2019s new open\napproach. his is irst exempliied by\nthe fact that iOS devices will be able\nto use external keyboards come fall.\nhis means that Android users will\nno longer be able to brag about being\nable to use Swype and Swiftkey, while\nsmirking at Apple users with their\ncrappy keyboard. In a similar vein,\nApple has now allowed developers\nto add widgets to their apps. Now,\nnotiication centre will actually\nbecome actually useful.\nhere were many other exciting\nfeatures, like a redesign of multi-tasking, which if you have a\ncompatible iOS device I would\nseriously consider checking out if I\nwas you.\nhis is a really good update to iOS,\nwhich I await with anticipation.\nhis keynote was Apple without\nfear, without expectation. hey\nintroduced great new products, and\neven a new programming language,\nswift. hey have made their platform\nmore open for developers and\ncustomers alike. Finally they seemed\nto have shrugged of some of the \u201cfailwithout-Jobs\u201d aura, and moved on. I\nreally hope for more of this.\niOS 8\nhere are lots of programming\ntutorials on the internet, but not all\nof them are equal. If you are new\nto programming, you should not\nworry about all the funny jargon and\ntechnicalities involved, especially the\nbit about \u201cabstraction\u201d. Start with\nsomething concrete, and fun. You\ncould start by going to the Khan\nAcademy and searching for a course\non computer programming.\nOtherwise,youcouldpickalanguage\nand start learning to program from\nthe language. Once you have a irm\ngrasp on one programming language,\nnew languages will be relatively\neasy to learn. I would recommend\nthat beginners start with Python, a\npowerful and versatile programming\nlanguages. It also introduces some\nvery useful programming paradigms\nand techniques that you might just\nind enlightening and interesting.\nhe oicial Python website has an\nextensive tutorial on learning the\nlanguage.\nOnce you have a irm grasp on\none language, you could try working\non some interesting projects.

It falls behind the rest\nof the world on all health indicators,\nincluding the poorer countries of\nSouth-East and South Asia that used\nto be behind Africa in the 1980s. he\naverage life expectancy worldwide is\n68, but in Africa only 54 according to\nthe World Health Organisation. Why\nis Africa so far behind?\nBiggest offenders\nIn 1990, the average life expectancy\nin Africa was 51. he life expectancy\nis steadily increasing due to conlicts\nbetween countries being resolved as\nwell as improvements in delivery of\nhealthcare and basic living conditions.\nHowever, Africa still has the lowest life\nexpectancy worldwide for a number of\nreasons, many of which are political.\nMany governments don\u2019t have\nenough or don\u2019t allocate enough\nresources to providing basic\nhealthcare where it is most needed.\nFor this reason, there aren\u2019t enough\nhospital buildings in several countries\nin Africa; treatments can therefore be\ndiicult to access on account of being\ntoofaraway.SouthAfrica,forexample,\nhave many of its healthcare facilities\nin large cities far away from rural\nareas. his ultimately deters poorer\npeople from using them because of\nthe distance and transport costs they\nwould incur. Also, medical equipment\nis often sparse and frequently breaks\ndown.\nFurthermore, inancial aid given\nto countries in Africa, unfortunately,\ndoesn\u2019t always reach where it is\nmost needed. At times it is misused,\nentering personal accounts or to fund\npolitical agendas.\nAlmost two thirds of the deaths\nin Africa are due to communicable\ndiseases, maternal and perinatal\nconditions. he majority of these\ndeaths are due to infectious and\nparasitic diseases. his is almost\nopposite to the causes of deaths\nworldwide, where non-communicable\ndisease such cardiovascular diseases\nand cancer are the biggest killers.\nHIV is still amongst the worst\nofenders; killing 1.3 million people\na year in Africa. Next in line are\nrespiratory infections, such as\npneumonia, which cause 1.1 million\ndeaths a year. After these, are the\ndiarrhoeal diseases such as malaria\nkilling almost a million Africans\na year due to polluted water and\npoor sanitation. he prevalence of\nthese diseases and infections are\nconsiderably lower in developed\ncountries due to better access to\nhealthcare amongst numerous other\nfactors.\nAfrica fights back\nOver the past 10 years the incidence\nof HIV/AIDS has dropped in several\ncountries in Africa. his is largely due\nto awareness programmes, such as\n\u2018ABC\u2019 which tells people to \u2018abstain,\nbe faithful and condomise\u2019. Several\norganisations have also been involved\nin making antiretroviral drugs\nafordable. Tuberculosis is another\ndisease that has seen reductions\nacross the continent due to an\nincrease in successful treatments and\nimmunisations.\nFinally malaria has been eradicated\nworldwide, except for some countries\nin Asia, and is slowly declining in\nAfrica. he distribution of millions of\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets has\nmade a cause of this decline. However,\nrecently there is evidence that these\nnets are leading to an increase in\nresistant mosquitos and could cause\nthe incidence of malaria to return to\nwhat it was.\nFocusing on these pandemics\nhas made vast improvements to\nthe average life expectancy in\nAfrica. Nevertheless, some people\nbelieve that more attention should\nbe paid to developing health\nsystems in a more general way. his\nwould involve making advances\nin primary healthcare including\nhealth education, safe water, basic\nsanitation and immunisation against\nmajor infectious diseases as deined\nby the World Health Organisation.\nSuch primary healthcare should be\naccessible to everyone and at a cost\nthat both the community and country\ncan realistically maintain.\nhis could potentially enable Africa\nto eradicate the same diseases that\nother countries worldwide have\nsuccessful managed to do. On the\nother hand, the resources for this\nwould be extensive and is likely to be\nthe major limiting factor in Africa\u2019s\nmove to a more developed healthcare\nsystem.\nExpenditure\nExpenditure plays a huge role in\ndetermining the success of healthcare\nsystems worldwide: it consists of\ngovernment spending, external\nsources and private spending. In\n2001, the heads of state of African\nUnion countries met in Abuja, Nigeria\nand agreed to commit 15% of their\nnational budget on health spending.\nhis was made after he Millennium\nDevelopment Goals were formed\nin 2000 promising to reduce child\nmortality rates, improve maternal\nhealth and ight HIV/AIDS amongst\nother pledges. However, in 2010 only\nfour countries complied: Rwanda,\nBotswana, Zambia and Togo.\nExternal aid such as foreign\ngovernments and Non-government\nOrganisations have played a\nsigniicant factor in dealing with\nhealth emergencies in Africa. he\nNGOs seen to be more independent\nand therefore less likely to have\nulterior motives making them more\nefective.\nPrivate spending consists of people\npaying directly for treatment but this\ncould cause those who are poor to go\nbankrupt in order to pay their medical\nbills.\nIt could also deter people from\nseeking necessary medical attention.\nAnother form of private spending is\nwhere a tax is collected on a regular\nbasis and directed into health\ninsurance schemes. Many believe this\nis where the future lies.\nRoom for growth\nhe exciting thing about Africa is\nthe room for growth. A number\nof countries are making successful\neforts in improving their healthcare\nsystems in order to address their\npopulation\u2019s medical needs. Ghana\nfor example, removed healthcare fees\nfor women resulting in a reduction in\nmaternal mortality. Initiatives such\nas providing more free healthcare in\nrural areas and the increasing number\nof health insurance schemes has seen\nvast reductions in mortality. hese\ninitiatives are likely to be the crux\nto the development of a successful\nhealthcare system in the beautiful\ncontinent that is Africa.\nS\ncientists are making\nprogress in increasing\nthe eiciency of\nphotosynthesis, the\nprocess that fuels plant\ngrowth. Such research has huge\npotential from meeting the demands\nof 21st century food security to\nincreasing the feasibility of biofuels\nand to restoring previously damaged\nenvironments. However, with such\nreward could come great risk.\nPhotosynthesis is the process all\nplants carry out which harvests\nsunlight and absorbs CO2\nto produce\nfuel for the plant to grow. he problem\nis that in its naturally occurring state,\nphotosynthesis has evolved to be\nrelatively ineicient in order to avoid\na toxin build up that could kill the\nplant. In important food crops such\nas wheat, barley and sugar beet, the\nmaximum eiciency is a mere 5%.\nhree research teams, all including\nscientists from both the UK and the\nUSA, have recently been granted a\ncrucial second round of funding to\naddress this problem. Much of the\nresearch is focused around attempting\nto use genes from certain bacteria\nand algae that already carry out\nphotosynthesis very eiciently and\ntransfer them into the DNA of major\nfood crops.\nWith major cereal crop demand\nset to rise from 2.1 billion tons\ntoday to 3 billion tons in 2050, such\nresearch could become invaluable in\nfeeding the world of tomorrow. For\nindustry, artiicially engineered fast\nplant growth could prove valuable\nas companies look to ofset their\nemissions and land use impacts in an\nincreasingly regulated environment.\nAs a general, overarching beneit,\nmore eiciently photosynthesising\nplants means more CO2\nis absorbed\nfrom the atmosphere, thereby\nsigniicantly helping mitigate climate\nchange.\nWhilst improving photosynthesis\nhasuntoldpotentialintacklingsomeof\nthe world\u2019s most pertinent problems,\nit is perhaps not unreasonable to\nsuggest that a warning lare must be\nshot within the scientiic community\nto proceed with caution because its\npotential, both good and bad is just\nthat: untold.\nProceeding with precaution\nhas become a central dogma of\nenvironmental science. his is for\nthe simple reason that ecosystems\nexist as such inely balanced systems\nwith such impossibly complex webs\nof interactions, that even the smallest\ninterferences can be expressed,\nthrough a \u2018butterly efect\u2019 as serious,\nglobal-scale problems, years down the\nline. Citing the problem with excess\nnitrogen fertiliser pollution of water\ncourses world-wide, nitrogen fertilizer\nwas irst invented to increase food\nproduction by providing nitrogen\nfertilization of crop plants at an\nintensity that simply wasn\u2019t possible\nin nature. Whilst it has been credited\nwithincreasingglobalfoodproduction\nby a factor of many, it has led to a huge\namount of environmental damage and\nis one of the greatest environmental\nproblems of our time. In other words,\nit has become a problem from a past\nsolution.\nTo proceed with engineering plants\nto grow faster we must decide whether\nwe want to act and release the beneits\nthe research has to ofer, knowing that\nwewillmostprobablyhavetodealwith\nserious consequences in the future, or\nwhether we just sit back, knowing we\ncould have done something.\nThe Healthcare System in Africa\nShade oyewole\nWriter\nLawrence D\u2019Silva\nEnvironment & Health Editor\nIf Plants Could Grow Faster\nScientists research ways of making Photosynthesis more eficient\nFat or muscle?\nWe are inviting healthy volunteers to take part in a research study comparing body\nfat and metabolism in young adults.
