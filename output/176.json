    "content": "THE EXPANSION\nby LAWRIE AUSTIN\n2 from 3 Permutation.\nSTUDENT: THE UNIONS : EXPANSION\nThe permutation of three simple nouns gives\nrise to the problems of the Union Officials\nof 1. C. and t fie Constituent Colleges.\nTHE STUDENT UNIONS ; THE UNION EXPANSION\nSTUDENT EXPANSIONS\nThe batting advice given to the semi-paralytic batsman was \"Hit out at the Middle one\" so likewise being of a semi-sober\n(semi-paralytic) frame of mind I will kickoff with the Unions.\nSince it is the Unions I will confine my\nremarks to I.C. and the Guilds. During the\npast few weeks I have heard the following\nquestions asked and discussed at least a dozen times, \"What's wrong with the I.C. Union this year?\" My answer to this has\nbeen that in general there is nothing very\nwrong (at least no more than usual) and that\npart of the faults lies outside the control of\nthe lads inside the Union Office. Just take a look at the record so far this year. The clubs\nand societies are extremely active and once\n, again smoothly a nfl f efficient lv run. The Union\nhas emerged from the Staff-Student Officer\ndiscussions on the all important StudentUnion expansion into South Side with flying\ncolours, and at a time like this failure to put,\nthe students' point of view to the planning\nStaff and Administrative Staff .might as well\nhave caused a great deal of frustration and\ndisappointment to future students of the I.C. Union. The Union building has. all in all,\nall things taken into account, all things being equal, been very well managed? I'.C. has\nonce again dominated U.L. competitions and\nhas represented U.L. sporting and social\nclubs to a high degree. As I see it the only\nflies in the ointment are the I.C. Union Meetings. One Quorum out of three real lv is not\nfood enough, and. in mv opinion, due to two\nfactors: I.) Poor agendas. Who's fault? The\nExecutive's? Or. perhaps yours Mr. Member? You see this year's President, Si\nLvle has not \"pushed or rigged\" motions for\nUnion Meetings but left it to the student to\nraise his own questions and suggestions.\nWhen two meetings are in quo rate then it\ncan only be assumed that evey one is\n\"Happy\" so to speak . . . however, if any\nUnion member should be \"Unhappy\" then\n\"To Speak\" is the solution . . .\n2.) Poor, practically non-existant publicity\nof forthcoming Meetings. Unfortunately it\nhas been realised a little too late that the\n., average Union Member cannot read stereotyped notices from a distance ranging from\none foot to infinity and like as not has been\ntold (and even then several times probably)\nand persuaded to come along.\nThe Constituent Colleges' play a complementary and not a separate part /in the\nstructure of the I.C. Union and the Constituent College Man should try to ^member\nthis; and at this point I will put on my other\ncap and mention Guilds Union. This year\nin Guilds we have had four Union Meetings\nand all of them have had an I.C. quorum\npresent! Naturally, it has been very encouraging for us to see a revival in Union s pim and at a time when it was most needed, f admit that to date \"sport in general\" has\nbeen the theme and that in all cases attract-FELIX\nive agenda and publicity has set the scene\nfor spontaneous humour from the Guildsmen . . . I have not been disappointed.\nThe next few years is going to be difficult\nfor the Guilds Union Officers during the\nchange over from the old dust v Waterhouse\nbuilding into the three new shiny plate glass\nand polished wood buildings which tend to\nscratch rather easily and where it will be\nsome years yet before the performance of the\nfire hoses have been fully determined! Varnish and polish when applied to Constituent\nUnions tend to leave a dull finish and it will\nbe very much up to the 300 or so enthusiastic\nGuildsmen / women to carry the Union safely\nover this \"transitional\" river.\nHowever, the expansion has not only\ncreated problems it has also solved one. The\nUnion will have a large spacious, luxurious\nand well equip ed Union Office in E.l. By\ntearing out the \"heart of the old Union\" By\ndemolishing Waterhouse the expansion has\nthoughtfully created us a new one almost in\nthe centre of the Engineering Buildings which\nwill no doubt prove to be not only a centre\nof Union activities but also a meeting place\nfor the sporting and social clubs.\nThe student expansion in Guilds will be\ncompleted b v1965 when the numbers will\nhave risen from the present 1.200 to 1,500\nand this increase will be almost entire lv post-graduates, and consequently has forced the\nUnion to review its policies. (For example\nnext year th re will be more post-graduates than undergraduate fresher s.). Next year,\nfor the first time, with financial aid from the\nOld Centralians post-graduate receptions as\nwell as fresher s dinners will be held in the\nfirst term.\nFor the student who finds time only for\nwork I will leave him with the following\nChinese proverb . . .\nConfucius he says \"All work and no play\nmakes Jack richest man tin the Graveyard\".\nThe Vicious Circle\nby FINLAY MCPHERSON\nA university education is one of the most\nsought after status symbols of today. The\neager schoolboys come from miles around to\nobtain entrance to this College whilst principals remind the fresher of the ghostly\nfigures of those who were turned away. But\nwhen the hubbub has died down and the\nfinal examinations have been taken, can the\nresults be said to be educational? Or have\nyou obtained a portable bibliography?\nTo raise a technical college to the level\nof a University one must have a system\nwhich teaches student how to think and more\nimportant still, how to communicate his\nthought. It is the latter problem which causes\nthe most hardship, To communicate one's ideas to another, despite the perfections of\nlanguage, has always been man's most difficult problem.\nIn this country in particular people are\nloth to exchange ideas and thoughts in case\nthese confidences are misused. As a result\nmany people are neurotic, self-centred, lonely and unhappy. They retain their thoughts\nand they seldom voice their opinions lest\nthey be ridiculed. How often will someone\npour scorn on someone's ideas while inwardly wanting to acknowledge them?\nIt is this problem, the problem of expression that the Universities must solve. Let us\nlook at a specific example. The Royal College of Science. At the beginning of last year\nan analysis of the situation showed that\nmany students knew little or nothing about\nthe activities of the Department that they\n5 \u2014\nwere in, few of the staff knew what was going on in other departments, upon examination one found that the students and the\nstaff wanted to get on friendlier terms Hut\nboth sides were worried as to what would\nbe the reaction of the other.\nThe R.C.S. Union looked at the situation\nfor a considerable time and changes have\nbeen made in its structure to see if a better\nrelationship with the staff within the large\ndepartments could not be attained. The s ys tem, comprising of a departmental committee in each of the three large departments,\nshould go a long way in easing the 'barrier'\n:that exists between students and staff. It\nshould enable the students to know more about\ntheir fellow students as well as helping the\nstaff to keep in touch with present day student feel i hg. The possibility of this sv stem lies in the\nfuture. It could be used by various gro irp s such as entertainments to whip up support\nby getting the various departmental committees to organise sections; it could be used\nto provide a feed-back mechanism for complaints and suggestions on the course; it\ncould be used to solve problems that may\narise in a particular year or from a particular\nstudent. However, its main intention is to\nstrengthen the Union and to prevent the all\ntoo prevalent tendencies to Technicalia.\nIn the book of a Chinese thinker who\nlived the '4th century B.C., Chuang-tsu, certain symbolic characters are conversing to-get her, and one of them, called the God of\nthe Northern Sea, asks, \"How shall I talk\nof the sea to a frog, if he has- never left his\npond? How shall I talk of the frost to the\nbird of the summer land, if it has never left\nthe land of its birth? How shall I talk of\nj fe with the sage, if he is the prisoner of\nhis doctrine?\"\nIt is important that both students and staff\nalike are the captains of then souls rather\nthan the prisoners of their doctrines. A new\nsystem such as the R. C.S.U. have got, may\nhelp solve a situation but it is far'from pro-vidi np the answer.\nIt is necessary for all at this College to\ntalk, argue, debate, discuss, look, see and\nreport, and above all l understand. The back-biting, pernicious scrabbling s of gossip M non gers; the lonely self-centred and, all too of-ten, selfish way of life of the brown w bag fer; the lack of understanding, the attitude of\nmind of an English, that most civilised of\ncreatures although it is the reddish mantle\nof decaying Empire tea-parties that he\nwears, that attitude of mind which smiles\npolitely and when you are gone waxes loud\nin vilification; all these things must disappear if we wish to become a University.\nAll the present problems stem from our\ninability to communicate; the problem of\ncoloured students is brought about by the\nproblem of the in expressive, seemingly dis-/n te rested inarticulate frame of mind which\nis settling in this latter- day Urbania. The\ninterest each person has in another is very\nreal, for it is only by this common touch'\nthat one can enlarge and verify one's own\nexperience whilst escaping from the private\nhell of lon lines s. The difficulty is that everyone wants to find out at no personal cost\nwhat is the world which lies around. One\ncan only discover, one can only communicate by accepting the responsibility for one's own actions and stepping out to meet the\nother point of view. Of course, all does not\ngo well but not until people cast off their\nhysterical shell of enforced turpitude and\nstep out to meet the challenge and see the\nworld for the first time, will we even begin\nto approach the level of a University.\nTo think and not express the thought is\nto sow the seed and not reap the harvest\n\n"

    "content": "THE UNION IS MY SHEPHERD There's nothing wrong with this Union\nby MJ. STACBY\nEvery year we bear a great deal of talk\nabout what is wrong with the Union. Now\npotential solutions as there are critics. Now\nI am not proposing to put forward any kind\nof panacea for such short-comings as we have\nbecause I honest lv don't believe that there\nis all that organically wrong with the Union.\nIf anything, we diagnose an occasional mal-aise; nothing more serious.\nWhat I am proposing to do is to examine\na particular aspect of students in general,\none Hhat is of the utmost n rn xv lance, vet\none which almost never receives any at ten tion. Their sense of perspective.\nFor the first week or so after students join\nthis College, they suffer through speech after\nafter speech exhorting them to 'strive\na balance between work and relaxation.\nLet's examine a few facts.\na. This is quite a hard working College;\nno courses are yet extended to four years although this is common in other universities,\nyet our standards are as good or better than\nfli eir s as evidenced by the salaries offered 10\nour graduates.\nb. This is an expanding College. The number of students capable of easily doing well\nis not expanding nearly so fast, but the College authorities are rightly reluctant to lower\nour standards.\nc. This is one of the principal schools of\npost-graduates study in the country. About\nI man in 4 is working on a post-graduate\ncourse of research and a large percentage of\nthese are from overseas.\nI need hardly add that we are a predominantly masculine .entirely scientific or technological College situated in the largest city in\nBritain, or that our students mostly live away\nfrom the campus, and that this makes comparison with most other large London colleges difficult\nIt is pre t tv clear what all this adds up to.\nPrecisely the situation we observe and about\nwhich so man v complain. We have a hare\nce re of 'sport men', an uncounted army of\n'brown-bag gers', and a number of students\nvariously estimated between 500 and 1,000,\nabout whom little is said, but who fall somewhere between these two categories.\nThe most unfortunate aspect of all is that\na lack of understanding and tolerance has\ngrown up between the extreme groups. The\nmen in the bar loudly inveigh the brown-bag-ger without ever accepting that there must\nbe a very large number of people in this College who will be lucky to get so much as\na pass unless the v do little else but work,\nau it e apart from the very studious tv pes which\ntend to cone ree ate in places like this. And\nlet's be perfectly clear that a student's main\njob is to get a degree. As for the brown-bag-gers themselves, the v usual lv resent the no is v self-assertiveness of the sport men. and fail to\nrec ogni7 ei their good fortune in being able\nto keep their tutor* ha ppv and still eni ov an\nactive recreational life. Add to them the\nconsiderable number of married post-graduates and overseas students whose interests are\ngenerally very diverse n no we are forced to\nadmit that about one third of the student\nbody will always take little or no part in\nactivities no matter what inducements are\noffered.\nThe fault is not with the Union but\nwith the people themselves, but here we\nrun up against the rather intolerant\ngroup attitudes which are probably largely s prawned by the types of training\nour students receive. People who are\ncontinuously disciplined in equation and\nexactitude sun con cio us ly tend to be equally\nuncompromising in their asses ment of their\nfellows whom they ruth le sly categorize. The\nprevalent attitude is that one falls into one\ngroup or another, and that once labelled,\nthere is but a small chance of redemption,\nit is a severe indictment of the thinking of\na student body that one is either destined\nfor the 9 to 5 routine or else a highly active,\nobviously enjoyable, though extremely taxing existence as one of the fortunate few,\nwhile those who do struggle for a compromise are banished to virtual obscurity. This\nmay appear extreme, but in reality is the\ntho ice which has to be made by everyone\nin college at some time.\nJust what can be done to improve matters\nis a subject of endless debate. We hear optimists who glibly suggest that everything\ncan be achieved by a judicious wave of a Presidential magic wand, while taking care\nnever to be very specific as to the exact\nmanner of the transformation. Sceptics on\nthe other hand evince astonishment when\nanyone does manage to work up some corporate activity in which many students can\ntake some part rather than it being the prerogative of a small group: for example, the\nCharity Carnival. But the principal obstacles\nremain \u2014 academic pressure and geo gra pn ical environment, conspire to make regular,\neven though not particularly demanding,\nparticipation in Union life something of a problem for a great number of students. The\nCollege authorities have gone to great effort\nand expense to ameliorate the Kfe of our\nhund rer s of scattered digs dwellers. Next\nv ear, South Side will open accommodation\nfor another 450 students and by the time\nthe East Side residence is completed, our\nhostel capacity will top 1000 places. In addition to this, the pressure on the ac como d ation near the College is eased and many\nstudents can move closer. Freed from the\nnagging worry of train timetables, rush hour\ncrowds, uneaten meals and refractory land-ladies, and all the man v incident difficulties\nof digs, flats and even homes, the student\nwho at present dashes for the 5.44 can look\nforward to some agreeable relaxation in or\naround the Union. Furthermore, as the number of students available increases, it is quite,\nreasonable to expect a corresponding rise in the\namount of activity' around the Union. For\nthis reason, if for no other, I am inclined not\nto agree with those who suggest that as soon\nas South Side opens, the student body will\ndesert our present Union building in favour\nof some smart furniture and the mixed bar.\nWe are at this moments confronted with\na task of some considerable magnitude and\ncomplexity, yet one that carries a come n sur ate reward. I think it is time to get our own\nthinking straight. We are all members of this\nUnion, from brown-b agger to Executive Officer, and it is our collective interest that is\nat stake. It's time to stop dividing ourselves\ninto watertight groups, and it's time to take\na new look at the problem and to get things\nin perspective. Then it will be time to get\non with the job.\nby JOHN FAIRFIELD\nPresident of Mines\nThe Union is my shepherd: I shall not\nwork.\nTr me the biggest problem of running a Union is doing just that and trying to get\na degree all at the same time. Be that as\nit may, I would certainly prefer it that way\nrather than being a postgraduate President.\nThe trouble with so many post-graduate\nPresidents is that they tend to devote far\ntoo much of their time in trying to run the\nwhole outfit by themselves. To me the greatest proviso in running a Union is for the\nman in charge to have an efficient and effective committee behind him. I must confess\nthat one of my major problems is time, and\nhere of course you turn around and suggest\nthat if I was aP.G. I would have more time.\nTo this I say 'Yes', but still that it is not\nnecessarily a good thing. The greatest essential is being in permanent contact with the\nentire Union and this is, certainly facilitated\nby being an undergraduate. I do not suggest,\nhowever, that an undergraduate could ever\nsurvive as President of I.C. Why not? The\ntime factor again. Within Mines and I'.C.I have twelve boards and committees to sit\non, most of which meet at least two or three\ntimes a term, so heaven knows how many\npoor old Si has.\nAs President of Mines I have a decided advantage over my two colleagues in that all\nMinesmen are thankfully still all under the\nsame roof, which not only greatly improves\ndepartmental contact, but also staff-student\nrelations.\nI will admit that our numbers are inferior\nto our rivals within I.C. and this once again\nmakes matters somewhat easier as far as running the Union is concerned, but considering\nthat we are barely one quarter the size of\neach of the other two we certainly get more\nthan our fair share of spoils (rowing excluded).\nIn fact it was not until last year our five\nyear reign as dual Rugby Cup winners was\nended, and only three years ago we lost the\nRector's Cup for the first time since it was\ninitiated.\nBeing the size that we are we could easily\nget ousted out of nearly everything \u2014 that\nwe are not is proof of the importance of\neveryone within the Union pulling their\nweight.\nWith the coming of South Side, Constituent College Union spirit will be tested to the\nfull, so forget those 'Provincial, Universities'\nand let Hall spirit take care of itself.\nI shall fear no recriminations, for the Union\nis with me. The bar shall comfort me.\nAnother problem facing a Constituent College President is that he is automatically a Vice-President of I.C. \u2014 another large absorber of time. (Some day I 'll get around to\nfinding out whose lectures I should be attending on Mondays.). This of course, brings\nme to the question of having a deputy President of I.C. in addition to the secretary.\nI for one am wholeheartedly in favour of\nthis, and had more of you bothered to attend the last I'.C. Union meeting we could\nhave had a quorum to discuss this. With the\nopening of South Side the pressure will really be on the Executive in earnest, but on\nthe present showing of apathy we won't even\nhave one (or a Council) next year.\nThe Union will follow me all the days of\nmy life: and I shall dwell in a Council\nHouse for ever.\n\n"

HE APE IN ACTION CARNIVAL PROCESSION COLLECTS \u00a3105\nThe Carnival procession, winding its way\nthrough the astonished, bemused and generous inhabitants of Kensington, Fulham and\nChelsea, looked a cross between a Mardi\nGras she nadi gans and a Pyjama Party. Al though it was competing for attention against\nthe Cup Final, it collected over \u00a3105. 0\nSAKE POPULAR A TI.C. The Carnival Week received a warm send\noff at the May Ball, but by Monday the tempo was positively vibrating; a fast, colourful,\nand exciting evening was put on by the overseas societies. The pace was set by H.E., the\nAmbassador of Tunisia (fulfilling his fir tj t public appearance in England) briefly and fit-tingly. After a succession of guitarists, vio-li nist s, and comedians, the show reached a magnificent climax with the West Indies Steel\nBand. Mention at this stage should be made\nof Dan the Bomb who provided continuity\nwith jokes not in his usual repertoire.\nMeanwhile, back in the dining room, a constitution shattering assortment of national\nfood was laid on \u2014 most popular? Chinese\ntea. Unfortunately, one could not participate\nwholeheartedly without serious risk of indigestion. At the bar, a delightful Geisha did\na brisk trade in Sake, but beer still seemed to\nsell best.\nAfter the interval some fine dancing by\noriental beauties in national costume was followed by the popular Night Riders, a good\nnoise group of U.S. Navy origins.\nAn encouraging feature of the evening,\nwhich also included films and dancing, was\nthe large number of visitors who doubtless\nleft with a good Impression of I.C.U. profit\nof over \u00a370 was made for charity.\nCARNIVAL RAFFLE Won b vC.

There was some dismal dancing under\nthe Marquis and most pe pole adjourned to the\nWeek's Hall Bar, where from all accounts,\nqueer happenings were witnessed.\nSATURDAY AFTERNOON FE TE The previous evening, at 4 p.m. G.M.T. a world record was a tempted and broken at\nI.C. Mr. Heape swallowed two dozens eggs\nin the incredible time of 2 minutes and 11\nsees. He had trained for the previous week\non a dozen eggs (large) at lunch-time. The\nnews was reported by the B.B.C. and made\nthe front page of the Guardian and the Express.\nThe Fete was poorly attended due to the\nweather being inclement The Union at last\ngot its chance to pelt the executive, which\nnearly got out of hand when at one stage,\ncarried away by enthusiasm and successful\nrna rkman ship, die throwers didn't pay anything but just grabbed the rotten fruit and\nvegetables and let go.\nThe exhibition of Judo was the highlight of\nthe afternoon.

    "content": "FELIX\nhe may be of outstanding cultural and intellectual ability, his con tru but ion to the\nstudent world is stultified, and in some\ncases completely atrophied, because he is not\n,at home' in his surroundings.\n2. There is also the problem of colour pre-jud ice. There is perhaps a grain of truth in\nwhat is called the British Reserve. But mv observations of the public behaviour of the\nEnglish student leads me to describe his\nbehaviour in certain respects as anything but\nreserved. Much real discrimination is involved in the question of student ac com mod ation. I am aware that there is an ever increasing number who view the whole question of colour discriminating in accommodation with horror and who are trying to do\nsomething about it. But the stark fact remains that over 20% of the advertisements\nin some of the London Local weekly newspapers bear the words 'no coloured'; and we\nmay safely con j uc ture that many of the remaining 80 % of landlords would never accept a coloured student. Their reasons,\nmake little difference to the coloured student who feels snubbed, humiliated and in-fer i or. When the man or woman so treated\nturns out to be a person of integrity, sensitivity and culture then the damage done can\nbe lasting and far reaching.\n3. The English often display an appalling\nignorance of the home countries of the overseas students, and of their interests. Under\nthe slogan of 'Never discuss religion or pol-i ties', many an EngHman successfully hides\nhis indifference to both \u2014 an indifference\nwhich can so easily lead to a neglect of the\nmore 'substantial' matters of life, in favour\n,of the Twist, or the Cup Final. Often overseas students lose all interest in disc is siu Ran v of their concerns and problems with\n'English pe pole because they believe the En<\u00bb'li sh have very little interest in or understanding of the various political or social in st it iut ions of their particular countries.\nWhy do we never seem to be able intelligently to distinguish between whether a man\nhas come from British Guina, or Jamaica,\nfrom India or Pakistan, from West or East\nAfrica?\nBy failing in this respect we fail right at\nthe start to make the proper initial contact\nwith the person concerned, for each person\nis proud of his particular country and does\nnot think it a compliment to be mistaken\nas coming from another\nOften because of these factors \u2014 and\nthere are many others too \u2014 the vast majority of studen s from overseas retreat into\nthemselves and limit their real personal relationships solely to those of their own ethnic or national groups, or bury themselves\ncompletely in their studies with the sole intention of getting a good degree quickly and\nthen hurrying home at the earliest opp o it unity. There are, of course, in addition the pei-en ni al student problems of lack of finance,\nclimatic and dietary difficulties. It is small\nwonder then, that in view of all these factors that mental breakdowns among students\nfrom overseas are said to be greater in number than among English students.\nThere are certain problems w hfc hf ice students coming from the church overseas,\nwhich they have to face in addition to those\nI have already mentioned. Having been\ntaught that the founders of the Christian\nChurch in his own homeland came from me\nWest, and most probably from this land, he\nis justified in peeking the confirmation of\nthe Faith in the lives and witness the people\nof England. But seek he does in vain, for\nbehind the mask of 'tolerance' fin matters\nof the Faith, lies hid the cold fact of\n'apathy' or 'indifference'. A very high proportion of overseas Christian students have\nno contact with Christian life and witness\nwhen thy are in England, and very few of\nthat number link up again with the Church\nwhen they return home. It has been my pri-vil age to be involved in the valient attempts\nof my own and other church traditions to\ndo something about solving these various\ndifficulties. I will end this article by making\ncertain suggestions.\nAlthough the problem of residential accommodation is {being tackled, progress is\nslow. Visiting, as I do the various halls of\nresidence it is only too clear that a sympathetic and considerate warden can bring\nout from a student qualities of leadership and responsibility. My experience \u2014 in\nthis matter of overseas students in the various university and college halls of residence\n\u2014 shows that in general the nun m ber of\nplaces allotted to them is high and for this\nwe have to be truly grateful.\nBut the problem of accommodation for\nthe student who is not in hall remains, and\nis still largely unsolved. There are various\nhostels for overseas students run by church\norganisations, such as the Methodist International House, in Bavswater; the William\nTemple House in Earl's Court; or other\nbodies interested in the wal fare of students\nform overseas, such as Zebra House in South\nKensington; Impala House in Regent's Park;\netc, or there are yet again halls of residence\nrun by agencies of the various governments\nsuch as the Indian Students' Union; Hong\nKong House; Malaya House; etc., but 20,000\nstudents is a lot of students. The Church\nof England has plans for a very large Hostel\nin London which can act as a transit centre\nbut the burning question of accommodation\nremains.\nThe British Council organises parties of\nstudents to visit certain areas in London \u2014\nfor example, areas like Acton OT Balham. A regular house to house visiting is conducted\nalong certain streets and accommodation is\nsought for students from overseas. Through\nthis method the names and addresses of\npeople who do not mind having students\nfrom overseas live with them is obtained. I would like to see such parties organised in\nImperial College, and I would be happy to\nhe included in any of them.\nThe people the overseas students get to\nknow and like best are those students with\nwhom they share a laboratory or attend a lecture wi fli. During the vacation many of\nthe overseas students have no home to return to and I feel sure that they would greatly welcome the opportunity to spend their\nvacation or a part of it \u2014 in the homes of\ntheir college friends. Hospitality may smack\nof 'the patronising attitude'. Friendship takes\ntime to grow and one having taken root\npersists.\nFinally a word to Christians upon whom\na special responsibility rests. 7 was a stranger and ye took me in' was our Lord's word\nof encouragement to those who did corporal\nworks of mercy for others. The least we can\ndo is not to weaken the faith of a brother\nfrom the church in other land. He wants to\nsee Christians living their faith not just discussing or talking about it. In the search for\n'accommodation; iri the inviting of foreign\ni students to your home during the vacation;\nin promoting the various activities of student bodies working for the interests 6f the\nstudents from overseas, such as the International Relations Club, \u2014 in all these wa#s we must feel an obligation and a duty, although at the time perhaps it might not prove\neither convenient nor even congenial.\nIVOR SMITH CAMERON\nFELIX SMALL ADS PAYING JOB Lucrative spare-time employment is offered\nby Oxford undergraduate publication\nrequiring representatives to sell advertising\nspace in London.
