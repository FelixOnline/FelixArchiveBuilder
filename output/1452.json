This file\nformat coupled with\nthe internet has lead\nto unprecedented access and portability\nof music, but at what cost?\nNaturally the most talked about issue is copyright violation through\ndownloading. Onlookers may find the\ncurrent efforts by the industry reminiscent to the \u2018Home Taping Is Killing\nMusic\u2019 propaganda of the 80s. I don\u2019t\nbelieve MP3s will kill off music, and\nthe industry has to bear responsibility\nfor the mess due to their reluctance to\nmodify a stagnant business model. That\ndoesn\u2019t make illegal downloading fine,\nbut instead of looking to persecute their\ntarget market with draconian punish-ments, the industry should be looking\nfor innovative new ways to encourage\npeople to spend their hard earned mon-ey. The industry\u2019s slumber has allowed\nApple to forge the model for them, and\nnow holds an effective monopoly on the\nonline sale of music, where the artist\u2019s\ncut is less than ever. I cannot believe\nthat most CD albums are of a comparable cost to their digital counterparts! In\nmy opinion, the whole pricing structure\nof music needs to be reevaluated.\nSo like many of you I expect, I have\na bloated iTunes library. I\u2019m finding it\nharder and harder to give albums the\ntime they deserve or simply focus on\ntracks that initially catch my attention.\nWhat to listen to on my walk in to uni is\nalways subject to a great amount of in-decision; I have too much choice on an\nMP3 player that can hold tens of thousands of songs. Limits are not always a\nbad thing. For me reverting back to predominantly buying and listening to CDs\nhas been way of combatting this, and\nlike vinyl I cannot foresee the complete\ndeath of the compact disc.\nDigital libraries of music has also led\nto the decline of the album, and songs\nare often listened to well out of context\nwith a library on shuffle, or a playlist. It\nhas allowed us much greater flexibility\nto listen to music how we want to. The\nalbum is still relevant, and while playlists have their place, for me the album\nstill reigns supreme. But with individual\ntrack purchases now the norm online,\nwill we see the album becoming much\nless of a standard for releasing music?\nI guess the final point should be given\ntosoundquality,althoughitisjustabout\nas subjective as points come. The difference between middle to low bitrate\nMP3s and uncompressed audio can\nbe stark if listened to with high quality\nequipment. However if the majority of\npeople do not significantly care about\nsound quality, then why should record\nlabels spend so much on decent recording and mastering? It would be a grave\nshame to \u2018audiophiles\u2019 everywhere.\nIn other news, Dion Dublin, the\nprominent 90\u2019s footballer, is inventing\na new musical instrument called \u2018The\nDube\u2019. If that doesn\u2019t make you excited,\nI dont know what will.\nChristopher Walmsley\nChristopher Walmsley Music Editor\nAfter a six year wait, Cypress Hill are\nunleashing new album \u201cRise Up\u201d this\nApril. As an appetizer for the taste of\nthings to come, \u201cGet Em Up\u201d is one\nhot chilli. Flawless rapping, sweet-ass\nbeats and shout-out-loud lines like\n\u201cSmoke up a pound with us\u201d cement\nthis as a genuine tune. - Greg Power\nMRK1\nSOUND OF\nCONTAGIOUS\nCONTAGIOUS\nCOMPILATION\nMost of the songs here are by Mancunian dj MRK1 so the name compilation\nis a bit dodgy. It has a greater dancefloor direction than say \u201c5 Years of Hyperdub\u201d and in that sense it\u2019s less \u2018varied\u2019. Nonetheless every track makes you\nwish that you had Matter\u2019s soundsystem\nin your bedroom. - Kadhim Shubber\nCYPRESS HILL\nGET EM UP\nCYPRESS HILL\nMUSIK\nSINGLE\nT\nhe sweaty gyspsy punks\nfrom Gogol Bordello\nmake particularly interesting music thanks to the\nincorporation of the different styles held dear by their multi-ethnic crew hailing from 9 different\ncountries. Clashing violins, accordions and saxophones against distorted\nguitars and pulsating drums the band\nmembers have merged their transcontinental musical influences to create a\nsound of their own.\nThomas Gobena, otherwise known\nas Tommy T, has been playing bass\nwith Gogol Bordello for four years now.\nBorn in Ethiopia, he moved to the U.S.\nwhen he was sixteen and later started\nhis own record label, C-side Entertainment, giving mainstream access to African artists. He has been working on his\nsolo album for years now, but between\nendless tours with Gogol Bordello (200\ngigs planned this year!) he has only just\nfound time to release it.\nThe album is named \u201cThe Prester\nJohn Sessions\u201d, after a legendary Ethiopian king who lived around the era of\nthe Crusaders and sent letters throughout Europe ranting on about the massiveness of his army and his treasures.\nJust as Prester John wanted to bring\nEthiopian culture to the rest of the\nworld, so Tommy T exposes the rich\nmusical culture of Ethiopia on record\nfor all to admire.\nThe song titles are full of references\nto Ethiopian culture that Tommy T\nwants you to investigate further to\nget the full power of the songs. Ethiopian rhythms and instruments (like the\nMassinqo, an awesome one-stringed\ninstrument played with a bow) pop up\nthroughout the mostly instrumental\ndub, jazz and reggae jams. \u201cSeptember\nBlues\u201d is a particular highlight: a saxophone duet featuring Ethiopian scales\nover a traditional Western blues line.\nThe few songs with vocals are the\nbest on offer though, between the sultry callings of Gigi on \u201cEden\u201d and the\nforever awesome Eugene Hutz on final\ntrack \u201cLifers\u201d.\nIt is a very different ordeal from\nGogol Bordello altogether, less in-your-face and more like a pensive\njourney through World Music sound-scapes. But there is one thing in common here: as Tommy T puts it himself\nthey always deal in \u201cmusic without\nboundaries\u201d, and that can only be\nthrilling.\nTommy T (centre) genuinely hangs out on the street telling jokes and in no way is this photo set up\n\u201cLightspeed\u201d is the first single from\ntheir debut \u201cVivarium\u201d. An up-tempo\ntrack with some guitar doodling to\naccompany pretty-boy frontman Sam\nMcTrusty\u2019s passionate vocals. It\u2019s a\nsolid rock song destined for arenas,\nwith sprinkles of prog here and there\nfor good measure. - Greg Power\nSHY CHILD\nLIQUID LOVE\nWALL OF\nSOUND\nALBUM\nOn their fourth album Shy Child have\nunfortunately missed one key element\nfrom the electronic/pop/psychedelia\nfusion; catchiness. The album keeps\nplaying but there\u2019s little in the music\nthat makes you notice or care much\neither. So not \u2018bad\u2019 but not \u2018good\u2019...\n- Kadhim Shubber\nTWIN ATLANTIC\nLIGHTSPEED\nRED BULL\nRECORDS\nSINGLE\nFace it, fuzzy American low-fi pop is the\n\u201cBig New Thing\u201d and resistance is fu-tile. Dum Dum Girls\u2019 (actually only one\ngirl) debut is a fun but nostalgic record\nto which the only response is to dance\naround your room in your underwear.\nMy favourite song is \u201cBhang Bhang I\u2019m\na Burnout\u201d. - Kadhim Shubber\nFOUR TET\nTHERE IS LOVE\nIN YOU\nDOMINO\nALBUM\nHis 14 month residency at East London\u2019s Plastic People has been the testing grounds for Four Tet\u2019s fifth full\nlength album. It\u2019s turned more in the\ndirection of his split EP with Burial\nthan his more ambient previous albums and is certainly a stellar release.\n- Christopher Walmsley\nDUM DUM\nGIRLS\nI WILL BE\nSUB POP\nALBUM\nLike a calmer and less innovative Future Of The Left, Explorer\u2019s Collective\nplay \u201chardcore pop\u201d: hook-laden rock\nn\u2019 roll with catchy choruses and far-out\nbridges. There\u2019s a little Beatles harmonies here, a little Led Zeppelin 70s\nrockin-out there. The lyrics are mostly\nchildish. Decent at best. - Greg Power\nDAN LE SAC VS.\nSCROOBIUS PIP\nTHE LOGIC OF\nCHANCE\nSUNDAY BEST\nALBUM\nThis album takes a few songs before it\ngets going. But songs \u201cGreat Britain\u201d\nand \u201cGet Better\u201d are fantastic. Scroobius Pip is at his lyrically stinging best.\nHe\u2019s political as usual alongside Dan\nle Sac\u2019s production which has reached\nnew heights. Simply, they\u2019ve nailed\ntheir sound. - Kadhim Shubber\nTHE\nEXPLORER\u2019S\nCOLLECTIVE\nCOLLECTIVE\nRECORDS\nEP\nAfter their glorious 2008 breakthrough \u201cMade In The Dark\u201d, it was\nalways going to be hard for Hot Chip\nto raise the bar with even weirder elec-tro-pop hits. Whereas the randomness\nof their previous album made it an intriguing listen, this album is slow and\nmostly boring. - Greg Power\nYEASAYER\nODD BLOOD\nSECRETLY\nCANADIAN\nALBUM\nI\u2019ve been looking forward to this album\nfor a long time but it\u2019s a little disap-pointing. I used to think that Yeasayer\ncombined \u2018pop\u2019 vocals with an unconventional trippy sound but the songs on\nthis album are conventional in a 90s pop\nway; in the vocals and melody. Maybe it\nwill grow on me... - Kadhim Shubber\nHOT CHIP\nONE LIFE\nSTAND\nEMI\nALBUM\n\n"

I\u2019ll be twenty one..\nBut it\u2019s not a big deal. All it does is\nmark another lap of the Earth\u2019s continual circumnavigation of the Sun,\nthe twenty-first with me tagging along\nfor the ride. But my birthday isn\u2019t very\nmeaningful in itself. To the regret of my\ncolleagues and lecturers, I won\u2019t suddenly\nbefilledwithwitandwisdomthatwasab-sent on Sunday night. This isn\u2019t Pok\u00e9mon\n\u2013 I won\u2019t suddenly evolve into someone\nstronger and smarter at Level 21. Shame.\nTwenty-one isn\u2019t even a particularly\nspectacular year. I kissed goodbye to my\nawkward teenage years twelve months\nago and am already well into the awkward\ntwenty-something years. Yes, I can drink\nin America...but the Union is consider-ablycloser,andpossiblycheapertoo.Over\nhere, all the fun stuff I can do at twenty-one I could do at eighteen at the latest.\nI don\u2019t understand the preoccupation\nwith celebrating birthdays either. It\u2019s not\nlike the olden days of yore when surviving\nfor a whole year was something to be con-gratulated.Livinginmodern-dayLondon,\nI have little to fear from the Black Death,\nleopards, falling pianos and the countless other perils that plagued my ancestors \u2013 with the possible exception of TB.\nProviding I don\u2019t do anything too stupid\n(no promises \u2013 I am a medical student),\nit\u2019s quite certain I can reach pensionable\nage...whatever that might be when I get\nthere. Maybe then there is room for celebrating birthdays at the beginning and\nend of life, those times when not dying for\ntwelve (consecutive) months is an actual\nchallenge.\nBut one thing birthdays are good for is\ndemonstrating the inevitable march of\ntime. We don\u2019t get an infinite supply of\nbirthdays, barely a hundred if we\u2019re very\nlucky and every birthday that passes is\none closer to our last. Oh, that\u2019s a cheery\nthought...but I\u2019m glad for the reminder. If\nI didn\u2019t have this impetus to get a move\non and do something with my life, I\nmight just wake up one morning and find\nout I\u2019m dead. And that kind of thing can\nput a real crimp in your day, believe me.\nSo what lies waiting for me in the lay-bys on the highway of life? In comes The\nPlan. First of all, I have to finish my de-gree, obviously. Then I have to find a job\nand lather, rinse, repeat until I retire.\nThen I can play bridge, learn to paint\nand take caravan holidays in Cornwall.\nAll the while, I\u2019ll be trying to iron out the\nsmall print in the social contract, the bits\nthat refer to a wife, kids and a Ford Focus\non the drive. That\u2019s more or less it. And\nthat\u2019s more or less...boring!\nWhile I admit it\u2019s a good plan, a perfectly serviceable plan, there\u2019s no way I\ncould be content with such a plan. It\u2019s too\nneat, too safe...too small! The Universe\nis nearly fourteen billion years old, and\nthat\u2019sjustthebitsweknowabout!Itisalso\nwhat we in the business like to describe as\n\u201creally big.\u201d Even if I never make it past the\nmoon, there\u2019s still plenty to see closer to\nhome. Twilights and sunrises, the nights\nof the northern lights, the heights of the\nHimalayas, the sights of Giza, Guyana\nand Gloucestershire, the lights of New\nYork (New York!) and frightfully more\nbesides. And all far more interesting than\ncatching the 7:13 bus to work in the midst\nof the morning rush hour. And I only\nhave another sixty, maybe seventy years\nto see it all!\nLife is undeniably short. That axiom\nis chiselled into my consciousness a bit\ndeeper with every new birthday. But noone said that life had to be impossibly\nsmall. Live big. Live huge. Live outrageously astronomical with a conservatory on the back!\nI\u2019m reminded of a birthday card I received last year. Inside it was a sentiment\nI\u2019ve taken very much to heart; Growing older is inevitable. Growing up is\noptional.\nMajidAl-Khalilasks Israel to learn from history\nT\nhe Palestinian Society did\nindeed organize an event\nto remind people of what\nhappened in Gaza a year\nago. Not to look for sym-pathy, but because, as Mr. Amit so well\nrecognizes, it is important to learn\nfrom history. In order to do that, people need to remember, understand and\napply to the present and the emerging\nfuture whatever they can learn from\nthe past. Not an easy task, as Israel\nclearly demonstrates to all of us.\nThe ferocity of the Zionist lobby is\nsuch that it has led to a climate where the\nonly figures that the media dare quote\nare those published by the Israelis themselves for fear of being labelled as one\nsided or accused of reporting falsehoods\n\u2013 a questionable set of circumstances if\never there was one. In truth, the full extent of the impact of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza one year ago may never be\nfully known. What is known is that well\nover 1,300 Palestinians were killed during \u201cOperation Cast Lead\u201d, over 400 of\nwhich were children, with more than\n5,000 left wounded. On the Israeli side,\n13 were killed, 10 of these were soldiers, 4\nof which died as a result of \u201cfriendly fire\u201d.\nThere are even fears that many of those\nwho were wounded, yet survived the attack may be at an elevated risk of cancer\nafter the reported use of DIME explosives and non-depleted uranium. This\nfrom a nation that suffered appalling persecution and systematic murder in their\nown recent past. One wonders where the\nlessons of history went.\nThe obliteration of the infrastructure\nin Gaza and the starvation of it\u2019s people of\nthe most basic essentials, including clean\ndrinking water, continues to this day and\nmay be seen as a collective punishment\nfor electing their own leaders in the form\nof Hamas. Although the Israeli settlements were dismantled in 2005, Israel remains in complete control of the air and\nsea around Gaza, as well as the crossings\ninto Israel. It is still, under international\nlaw, deemed to be an \u201coccupying power\u201d\nand is therefore bound by the fourth Geneva convention to ensure the supply of\nfood, medical and other essential servic-es. The report of the UN fact-finding mission on the Gaza crisis published after\nthe war found that \u201cthe Government [of\nIsrael] retains wide discretion about the\ntiming and manner of delivering fuel and\nelectricity supplies to the Gaza Strip, and\nthat this discretion appears to have been\nexercised capriciously and arbitrarily.\u201d\nWith regards to the tunnels under the\nEgyptian border which it was alleged in\nlast week\u2019s article were used to import\n\u201cexplosives instead of medicine and food\u201d\nthe same report called them \u201ca lifeline for\nthe Gaza economy and the people\u201d and\ndescribed them as \u201ca necessary means of\nsurvival under the circumstances\u201d. With\nregards to the importing of weapons into\nthe Gaza strip, one may well ask why it is\nthat the people of Gaza are the only ones\nin the entire Middle East who should not\nbe allowed weapons with which to defend themselves against one of the most\nadvanced military forces in the world.\nIt is certainly true that Arab nations are\npartly to blame for the extent of the current situation. One could even argue that\nthe continuous spectacle of the domination of the Palestinians is favourable\nto the corrupt kings, emirs and puppet\npresidents who rule the rest of the Arab\nworld. For them, it may be advantageous\ntoconvincetheirnativeArabpopulations\nthat they should be docile and make no\nattempt to resist their dictators. However,\nwhat last week\u2019s article fails to mention is\nthat this lack of solidarity is supported by\nthe Israelis themselves. Tzipi Livni, the\nthen Israeli foreign minister used a stage\nin Cairo to announce that Israel was prepared to use military force in Gaza and\nembraced Hosni Mubarak almost as the\nfirst bombs fell. More recently, Egyptian\nplans have been announced to build an\nunderground barrier beneath the border\nwith Gaza in order to halt the tunnels. All\nthis Egyptian treachery has been carried\nout through tacit complicity with Israel.\nFurthermore, to allege that the Egyptians have a greater obligation than the\nIsraelis to provide for Gaza\u2019s starving due\nto a greater cultural or religious affinity\ndoesn\u2019t seem to do justice to the principle\nthat we are all human, regardless of race.\nWhy should an Arab have a particular allegiance towards another Arab? Are we\nnot all the same?\nIt is hypocritical for Israel to accuse the\nEgyptians of treating the Palestinians\nbadly, but then again, the entire IsraeliArab conflict oozes with hypocrisy. The\nIsraeli government says that it wants\npeace and yet openly allows the further\nconstruction of settlements in the west\nbank that are deemed illegal under international law and does its utmost to\ndecrease the quality of life of every Palestinian through a system of checkpoints\nand apartheid that beggars belief. Since\nSeptember 2000, 68 women have given\nbirth at Israeli checkpoints, resulting in\n34 miscarriages. To deny the Palestinians\nthe most basic freedoms and then punish\nthem for taking up arms is ludicrous.\nPerhaps the greatest hypocrisy of all is\nthat Israel is a nation forged from the suffering of the Holocaust, surely the greatest\ncrime ever committed in human history.\nWe should indeed \u201clearn from experience\u201d and it is therefore unacceptable that\nIsrael is a country whose very foundation\nis built upon race and which treats those\nin Gaza in the same manner as the Jews\nin the Warsaw ghetto. Anyone who raises\nthese examples or who criticises Zionism\n\u2013 a political ideology rooted in racism, is\nsimply branded anti-Semitic. The goal\nof the Israelis since 1948 can only be the\ncomplete erasure of all remnants of Palestinian culture and history. The Arab\nproblem is reflected in the words of David\nBen Gurion himself: \u201cIf I were an Arab\nleader I would never make terms with Israel. That is natural: we have taken their\ncountry... Why should they accept that?\u201d *\n*Quote from page 99 of \u201cThe Jewish Paradox\u201d by Nahum Goldmann, 1978.\nRhys Davies is an old birthday grump\n\u201cThe entire IsraeliArab conflict oozes\nwith hipocrisy\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\nunderstand the\npreoccuption\nwith celebrating\nbirthdays\u201d\n\n"

The Pope\ncondemned the bill saying that \u201cIn\nsome respects it actually violates the\nnatural law upon which the equality of\nBenedict XVI\n\u2022 The 265th Pope\n\u2022 Born Joseph Alois\nRatzinger on 16 April\n1927 in Bavaria,\nGermany\n\u2022 Elected 19th April 2005\n\u2022 Ex-member of the\nHitler Youth\n\u2022 Fond of cats\n\u2022 Has stated the\ncondemnation of\ncondoms as an anti-HIV device\n\u201cIn some respects it\nactually violates the\nnatural law\u201d\nThe Pope on equality\nPope Benedict XVI rallies his supporters. \u201cDown with the iPad!\u201d he screams to the crowds below\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack\nGordon Brown is set to ask MPs to\nvote next week on holding a referendum on electoral reform. The Prime\nMinister is backing the proposal to replace the \u201cfirst past the post\u201d system of\nelecting MPs with an \u201calternative vote\u201d\n(AV) system.\nIn the AV system, voters rank candidates by preference rather than choosing a single name. The Conservatives\naccused Gordon Brown of trying to\n\u201cfiddle\u201d the voting system, while the\nLiberal Democrats, who are proposing a fully proportional system called\nsingle transferable vote (STV), said the\nproposal does not go far enough.\nThe Prime Minister is set to announce on Tuesday that a referendum\non changing the Westminster voting\nsystem, one we have had for centuries,\ncould be held by late 2011 if approved\nby Parliament. This proposal comes\nafter a protracted debate within the\nsenior ranks of the Labour party about\nthe merits of moving to a new system.\nall human beings is grounded and by\nwhich it is guaranteed\u201d.\nThe Pope should not be interfering\nin British politics. Unfortunately, religion still plays a part in the governance\nof the country, but since Henry VIII,\nthe far more controllable Church of\nEngland has been the state religion.\nThe problem arises from Catholic bishops who maintain seats in the\nHouse of Lords, and as a result still\nhave some say in the running of the\ncountry.\nLater this year, the Pope will be making the first Papal visit to the UK since\n1982. It is expected to cost the tax payer \u00a320,000,000.\nConsidering the Catholic Church is\nhardly poor, it seems odd that the taxpayer should be paying for this guy to\ntour the UK as we recover from a deep\nrecession. Then again, so are most of\nthe things Gordon Brown does, so inviting the Pope at taxpayers\u2019 expense is\nnot entirely extraordinary.\nWhy the Pope is worried that a gay\nperson should want to be a bishop in a\nchurch is somewhat beyond me. Why\nwould anybody want to preach that the\nway they live their life is wrong?\nThe Pope says that the Catholic religion does not allow for homosexuals to\nbecome priests, and that by saying that\nthe church can\u2019t discriminate in this\nway, society is impeding the Church\u2019s\nrelgious freedom.\nThis almost sounds fine until you remember why religons such as Mormonism which, initially at least, allowed for\npolygamy, are not allowed to practice\nthis \u2018freedom\u2019\n.\nThe reason for this is that you are\nallowed to believe whatever you like,\nyou\u2019re just not allowed to do whatever\n\u201cThe first papal\nvisit since 1982 will\ncost the taxpayer\n\u00a320m\u201d\nco\nco\nco\nco\nco d\nnd\nn\nnd\nndom\nom\noms\ns\ns as\nas\nas a\na\nan\nn\nn an\nan\nanti\nti\nti\nti--H\nHI\nH\nHI\nHI\nHI\nH\nHI\nHI\nHI\nH\nH\nHI\nH\nHI\nH\nHI\nHIV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV d\nde\nde\nde\nde i\nvi\ni\nvi\nvi\nvice\nce\nce\nce\nce\nce\nce\nce\nce\ne\nce\nce\nce\nce\nce\ne\ne\ne\nce\nce\n\u201cGordon\nBrown avoided\na leadership\nelection... and now\nwants to fiddle the\nelectoral system\u201d\nWith an AV system, if no candidate\nwins more than 50% of the vote in the\nfirst round, the votes of the candidates\nwith the least support are redistrib-uted, only stopping when a candidate\nhas a majority of votes cast. Its proponents say the system, despite not\nbeing proportional, is fairer than the\ncurrent system. Currently, many MPs\nare elected on a minority of the overall\nvote. The proposed system will retain\nthe link to constituencies, as would the\nLib Dem\u2019s STV system.\nDue to the expenses scandal, there\nhave been calls for wide political re-form. Mr Brown wants the referendum plan to be inserted as an amendment to the Constitutional Reform\nand Governance Bill currently before\nParliament. However, there may not\nbe enough time for it to be approved\nbefore the next election. Many Labour\nMPs are said to be sceptical, fearing\nthat their electoral prospects would be\ndamaged. However, a growing number\nof senior ministers are keen on the\nreform as a way of depicting the Conservatives as opponents of political\nreform.\nThe Conservatives are opposed to\nreplacing the current system as they\nclaim it results in stable governments.\nThere is, however, little reason why AV\nor STV should result in less stability.\n\u201cGordon Brown avoided a leadership\nelection, bottled a general election and\nnow wants to fiddle the electoral system,\u201d said Conservative chairman Eric\nPickles. \u201cIt is not the voting system\nthat needs changing; it\u2019s this weak and\ndivided government.\u201d\nThe Liberal Democrats say the proposed AV option is \u201ca small step in the\nright direction\u201d but not a substitute\nfor a required proportional system. \u201cIf\nthey agree it, this is a death-bed conversion from a party facing defeat at\nthe general election,\u201d said their home\naffairs spokesman Chris Huhne. Mr\nHuhne confirmed the party would put\nforward its own amendment to the bill.\n\u201cIt [the AV system] does not give voters real power over both the party and\nthe person elected as MP.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the voting\nsystem that needs\nchanging; it\u2019s this\nweak and divided\ngovernment\u201d\nPrime minister Gordon Brown is proposing a new, \u201cfairer\u201d electoral system\nElectoral reform\nyou like. Jonathan Finney of Stonewall, the gay rights group, has said that\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to guard against sweeping\nexemptions seeming to protect one\nperson\u2019s freedom, which actually really\nimpact on other people\u2019s.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWhat you can\u2019t start doing is saying that religious people have\nhard-won freedoms, we\u2019ll now restrict\nthose, we won\u2019t give them to gay people,\nwe won\u2019t give them to women.\u201d\nJames Lees comments on The Pope\u2019s message to British bishops\n\n"

There are obvious allusions\nto the sixties with trapezoidal cocktail\ncoats, flared skater skirts and the plays\non dimension with a big sleeveless\nblond fox vest and boxing glove-size\nmittens.\nThis season, the design backstory\ngoes, the Vuitton woman has stumbled\nacross a set of vintage LV trunks filled\nwith all types of goodies; the variation\nof textures was fantastic, amongst all\nthe fur were touches of lace, leather\nfringing on shoes and jackets... And the\ngraphics! Two-tone heart printed silk,\ntartan, Liberty prints and jacquards\nwere all combined beautifully for this\nbrazen Vuitton woman to cater for all\nher Parisian savoir-faire. She is a \u201cBelle\nde Jour\u201d \u2013 fresh, insolent\nand fabulous.\nAs for the accesso-ries, for a brand that\nhave been providing\nleather goods for the\ndiscerning\ncustomer\nsince\n1854,\nthey\ndid not disappoint. The new bag\nis a quirky steel lam\u00e9 jacquard on\nwool tote bag lined in quilted\nsafety orange, huge and pillow-like for the young at heart. For\nthe traditionalists there are the\nmost gorgeous little alligator\nchain-strap shoulder bags in\naubergine or slate patent finish \u2013 magpie-shiny and obviously luxe. Evening sandals\ncome complete with fur\nleg muffs or schoolgirl knee-high\nsocks, again with the obvious sixties overtones.\nWe can predict lots more fur\nthis Autumn/Winter, but in addition to the jackets we saw\nlast year we will see plenty of fur\ntrimmings and on accessories. The\nhuge textural variety, reminiscent\nof Matthew Williamson\u2019s last A/W\nseason, will help to continue the\nLondon fashionista\u2019s love affair with\nall things vintage.

Fletcher\nCast Gabourey Sidibe, Mo\u2019Nique,\nPaula Patton, Mariah Carey\nPrecious\nA very Precious film\nThis film is incredibly grim. That\u2019s a\nword that\u2019s been used to describe Precious quite frequently and, looking\nover the synopsis, that\u2019s definitely what\nyou get from it. Clareece Precious\nJones is an overweight, illiterate six-teen-year old girl living in poverty in\nHarlem, pregnant for the second time\nby her father. Her first child (a toddler\nwith Down\u2019s Syndrome who is casually\nreferred to as \u201cMongo\u201d) lives with her\ngrandmother, but Precious lives with\nher abusive mother and has just been\nsuspended from school.\nPrecious knows when to keep her\nmouth shut. In fact, for much of the\nfilm, Precious says very little and conducts herself with a slightly vacant indifference that many of the people in\nher life take for insolence or stupidity.\nThe side of Precious that we are presented with, however, is different. Her\nnarrative is sweet, hopeful and even\nhumorous. It is surprisingly poetic,\nand is never self-pitying. Director Lee\nDaniels interweaves some the most\nbleak and traumatic scenes of Precious\u2019 life with her glittering, exuberant fantasies, where Precious can be a\nglamorous celebrity, or dancer, or else\na pretty blonde white girl getting ready\nfor school. Precious does not just endure her hardships, she really shines\nthrough them with a strange kind of\noptimism that doesn\u2019t let her dwell too\nlong on misery. \u201cI feel all warm,\u201d she\nmuses after her maths teacher praises\nher, and then ducks to narrowly avoid\nher mother whacking a frying pan at\nher head.\nBut this is not a film that tries to\nshove a gratuitously gritty abuse story\nin your face, it never dares you to confront the harsh realism of it all in that\nfrustratingly arrogant way that some\nfilms do. At the same time, the film\ndoes not see her magically lifted out of\nher old life with saccharine fairytale-like convenience, even as Precious is\nplaced in an alternative school and is\ntaught to read by her extraordinarily patient and caring teacher (played\nby Paula Patton). Daniels handles the\nsubject matter in a way that is uncom-promising, without being unnecessary,\nand positive, without being sicken-ing. Sometimes, Daniels\u2019 abrupt scene\ntransitions and choice of contrasts can\nfall flat or seem jarring (although it\u2019s\nvery possible his intentions may have\nbeen for occasional bluntness), and\nthey disrupt the flow of the story, but\nnot enough to detract from the force of\nthe film\u2019s strong cast.\nAlready nominated for several BAFTAs and several more Oscars, the\ncast of this film carry it very\nwell. Newcomer Gabourey\nSidibe in the starring role\ngives a powerful and\nimpressively balanced\nperformance, never\noverdoing it. Similarly astounding is\nMo\u2019Nique, playing\nPrecious\u2019 mother\nwith terrifying real-ism. Both are nominated for BAFTAs in\nthe Best Leading and\nSupporting Actress\ncategories respectively,\nand deservedly so. Their\nperformances coupled with\nsome hand-held shooting,\ngive this film an almost doc-umentary-like feel, often a quite\ndisturbing sensation, considering\nthe subject matter. The supporting\nIs 3D the future\nof film?\nEdKnock\nEdKnock\ncast are equally strong, with Paula Patton, Lenny Kravitz and Mariah Carey\nas the few people in Precious\u2019 life who\nare working to improve her circum-stances. Mariah Carey was very good\n(now that\u2019s a sentence I never thought\nI would be saying).\nMany who have seen this film have\nmentioned on how they consider it\nto be an important experience, if not\na particularly enjoyable one. Whilst I\ndon\u2019t think that this is strictly true \u2013\nDaniels doesn\u2019t go out of his way to\ncreate something that people will find\nuncomfortable to watch \u2013 this is a film\nthat is definitely worth watching. Not\nthat it will necessarily change your life,\nbut because it is a tremendous presentation of a difficult story that showcases some truly\nimpressive\ntalent.\nhoice of contrasts can\njarring (although it\u2019s\ns intentions may have\nional bluntness), and\nflow of the story, but\netract from the force of\ncast.\nnated for several BAFl more Oscars, the\nm carry it very\nr Gabourey\nrring role\nful and\nanced\nnever\nSimig is\nying\nther\nreal-omi-As in\ng and\nctress\nctively,\nso. Their\noupled with\nd shooting,\nn almost doc-eel, often a quite\ntion, considering\ner. The supporting\ncases some truly\nimpressive\ntalent.\nNominations are in!\nT\nhe vast majority of you will\nhave experienced a film in\n3D by now, most probably\nAvatar. Now it seems that\nevery cinema is boasting\n3D as one of its attributes. However\nI can\u2019t help but think that this new\nmovement in cinema is just a gimmick\nemployed by studio bosses to entice\nviewers away from their TVs and back\nto the multiplexes. After all, we have\nseen it all before in the \u201850s when early\n3D was rolled out with cheap B-movies\nand, not surprisingly, failed. This trend\nwas set to repeat in the noughties as\na new 3D technology (which did not\naffect the quality of the visuals of the\nfilm) hit the market. We had many a\nsecond rate horror film such as Scar 3D\nand The Final Destination with knives\nand stakes that flew into your face.\nAlas there was a glimmer of hope\nwhen James Cameron announced his\nintention to release Avatar in 3D. Even\nbefore the film was released, other\nprominent directors jumped on the 3D\nbandwagon; Tim Burton with Alice in\nWonderland and Spielberg with Tintin.\nAvatar certainly looked more spectacular in three dimensions but it was\nnever a distraction from the film. The\nglasses we are now required to wear\nmanipulate polarised light instead of\nthe tacky red and green lenses we are\nused to from our youth.\nHowever all films released in 3D\nhave been CGI heavy or animated.\nOut of the ten films nominated for\nbest picture in this year\u2019s Oscars, two\nof them have been available in 3D; Up\nand Avatar. Both of these films had\nsignificantly larger budgets than many\nof the other nominated films such as\nPrecious and The Hurt Locker. Would\nthese films have been just as impressive in two dimensions? Probably not,\nthe films were constructed with 3D\nin mind; for example, the use of light\nin the night scenes for Avatar. In this\nsense the quality of a film could easily\nbe affected if lighting is compromised\nfor the sake of 3D.\nInterestingly old films are now being adapted for 3D and re-release in\ncinemas such as Toy Story. I believe\nthis is simply more than a marketing\nploy though, Toy Story would look\nfantastic in three dimensions but what\nabout other \u2018classics\u2019? Just imagine\nKirk Douglas marching down trenches\nin Paths of Glory, the famous tracking\nshot actually moving out of the screen\n- that would look amazing. Or the fleet\nof Hueys in Apocalypse Now hovering\nlow over the horizon as we anticipate\ntheir attack on the Vietnamese village?\nAgain that would benefit the crescendo of emotions the scene portrays.\nI\u2019m coming to the realisation that\n3D may only benefit certain films; The\nGodfather with all its natural lighting\nwould look terrible whereas The Matrix\u2019s \u2018bullet-time\u2019 sequences would\nlook fantastic. 3D is not going to be\nthe revolution that the development of\n\u2018talkies\u2019 and colour were but it is now\nanother option directors have. The development of 3D televisions (soon to hit\nthe market) is only going to increase the\npressure on directors from money-hun-gry studio accountants to release their\nfilms in the new format. Many directors\nwill of course shrug off 3D, viewing it as\nan infringement on the true aesthetics\nof cinema much in the same way that\nfilms are shot in black and white to give\nthem an artistic feel. Apart from that,\n3D is here to stay.\nY\nes, it\u2019s that time of the year\nagain - Oscar Season. The\nnominations for the 82nd\nAnnual Academy Awards\nhave been announced and there are a\nfew pleasant surprises. The major difference this time is that there are ten\npotential candidates for the most coveted Best Picture award. The field this\nyear is stronger than expected with Up\nin the Air, District 9 and A Serious Man\ndefinitely meriting a win but I predict\na two-horse race between Avatar and\nThe Hurt Locker (My money\u2019s on The\nHurt Locker though I\u2019d love District 9\nto win). With a Golden Globe already\nin his a cabinet, I can\u2019t see James Cameron recieving a statuette for best film\nor director as the Academy like to assert their independence and distance\nthemselves from the hype (he also behaved like a twat after cleaning up the\nOscars with Titanic).\nFor Best Director it\u2019s nice to see that\nTarantino has a nod and though Inglourious Basterds has its faults, it is\nprobably superior when it comes to\ndirection. Moving on to Best Actor\nand we find Morgan Freeman inevitably nominated for Invictus however\nthe bookie\u2019s favourite is Jeff Bridges for\nmusic biopic Crazy Heart. Best Actress\nis the most interesting category this\nyear; will the Academy be edgy and\ngive Gabourey Sidibe a statuette for\nPrecious or will Sandra Bullock take it\nfor The Blind Side?\nIt\u2019s shaping up to be one of the most\nexciting Oscars for years, Slumdog\nMillionaire dominated in 2009, 2008\nwas lacking any real quality films and\nThere Will be Blood and No Country\nFor Old Men were so brilliant in 2007\nthat no outsiders had a chance.\nBest Picture\nAvatar\nThe Blind Side\nDistrict 9\nAn Education\nThe Hurt Locker\nInglourious Basterds\nA Serious Man\nUp\nUp in the Air\nPrecious\nDirecting\nKathryn Bigelow - The\nHurt Locker\nJames Cameron - Avatar\nQuentin TarantinoInglourious Basterds\nLee Daniels - Precious\nJason Reitman - Up in the Air\nBest Screenplay\nDistrict 9 - Neill Blomkamp (adapted)\nAn Education - Nick Hornby (adapted)\nIn the Loop - Armando Iannucci (adapted)\nPrecious - Geoffery Flethcer (adapted)\nUp in the Air - Jason Reitman (adapted)\nThe Hurt Locker - Mark Boal (original)\nInglourious Basterds - Quentin Tarrantino (original)\nThe Messenger - Alessandro Camon (original)\nA Serious Man - Joel and Ethan Coen (original)\nUp - Bob Peterson, Pete Docter (original)\nBest Actor\nJeff Bridges - Crazy Heart\nGeorge Clooney - Up in the Air\nColin Firth - A Single Man\nMorgan Freeman - Invictus\nJeremy Renner - Hurt Locker\nBest Actress\nSandra Bullock - The Blind Slide\nHelen Mirren - The Last Station\nCarey Mulligan - An Education\nGabourey Sidibe - Precious\nMeryl Steep - Julie and Julia\n82nd Annual Academy Award nominations\nEd Knock looks through this year\u2019s Oscars\n\n"

    "content": "3\nfelix FRIDAY 05 FEBRUARY 2010\nNEWS\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHEFCE-y cuts across UK universities\nT\nwo weeks ago felix reported on the Government\u2019s\nplans for making British\nuniversities able to \u201coffer\nmore alternatives\u201d with\ncourses that would be \u201cmore flexible.\u201d\nThe Government had also promised to\nensure that sufficient funds are in place\nto avoid a repeat of last summer, when\nuniversities had tens of thousands fewer places than there were applicants to\nfill them.\nHowever, this week the Higher Education Funding Council for England\n(HEFCE), which is responsible for\nhanding out tax-payer funding to uni-versities, announced a \u00a3518 million cut\nfor the 2010-2011 academic year, relative to this year. These cuts amount to\n\u00a3449 million more than was expected.\nThe cuts include 15% of the entire\nbudget for universities\u2019 capital projects.\nFunding for teaching will drop by \u00a3215\nmillion. Maintenance budgets for historic campus buildings will be particularly badly affected. Accelerated postgraduate courses will lose \u00a324 million;\nas will two-year foundation degrees.\nResearch cuts have been predicted to\n\u201ccripple\u201d the sector.\nUniversities themselves will only\nfind out their individual allocations of\nthe money in March.\nAs would be expected, groups rep-W\nhilst prospective students to\nImperial may suffer from the\nbudget cuts announced this\nweek, current students may be\nwondering how they will be affected by the deficit left in next year\u2019s budget. Although experts\nhave argued that teaching quality will suffer, felix looks into how Imperial\u2019s student union will\nsuffer, and effectively any student involved with\nany of the 300+ Clubs or Societies.\nImperial College Union is set to take some\nslack of nationwide higher education cuts, the\nsecond time this has occurred in successive\nyears. Last year, the Union took a 5% cut on the\nCollege subvention (money given to them by\nCollege the previous year). Next year\u2019s money\nallocation looks to follow the trend of further\nfinancial slashes in light of the HEFCE\u2019s recent\nannouncements.\n*\nWHERE WILL THE UNION DECIDE TO TAKE\nFINANCIAL CUTS?\nRealistically, there are two options that Union\nPresident Ashley Brown can take when deciding where to reshape his budgets to the latest\nmoney constraints. He can either create savings\ncentrally, or allocate clubs and societies lower\nbudgets. Central savings refer to staffing and essential overhead costs that help run the Union\non a daily basis, and this is what took the brunt\nof the cuts in this year\u2019s budget.\nThis year, the clubs and societies did not see\nevidence of the 5% cut received by the Union, as\nJenny Morgan, last year\u2019s Union President saw\nfit to compensate the 5% deficit by the money\nsaved by making a senior member of staff re-dundant. This year saw a total of \u00a3360,000 given\ndirectly across all clubs and societies. College\u2019s\nsubvention totals \u00a31.25 million.\nAnother option that the Union has considered is to use the money from Executive Reserve; a pool of \u2018back-up\u2019 money that is generally added upon each year and can typically be\nused for the one-off costs that are necessary\nduring the course of the year. With extra funds\nadded, the Executive Reserve money currently\nstands at approximately \u00a320,000.\nSome of the \u00a320,000 will be used to upgrade\nthe Union building\u2019s security, which is currently\nseriously flawed. In the past months, felix has\nreported numerous counts of vandalism and\nsuspected break-ins.\nHowever, felix can report that the money\nfrom Executive Reserve will not make up the\nlatest budget cuts placed on the Union by College for next year.\n*\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES SLASHED\nThere will not be much spare cash lying around\nnext year as hundreds of the Union-run Clubs\n& Societies look set to take a cut on their budgets from last year.\nAs club and society chairs finalise their\nbudget requests for the year 2010-11 this week,\nthere is certainty amongst the Union staff that\nthe vast majority of them will not receive the\namount they ask for. February each year usually\nsees each club or society committee decide on\ntheir budgeting requests for the following academic year starting that August.\nOn top of the grants given to each club or\nsociety, finance and administration assistance\ngenerally equates to about a third of the Union\u2019s\noverall budget for each year.\nMr. Brown acknowledges that there needs\nto be other ways in which the Union can save\nmoney to mitigate the cuts.\nHe said: \u201cWe have been looking at other op-tions, such as reducing the amount of paper we\ngenerate, particularly around freshers\u2019 week.\nThis has benefits for both environmental and\ncost reasons, but is comparatively small.\u201d\n*\nHOW BIG WILL THE CUTS BE?\nThe simple answer is that no one quite knows,\nbut there will be cuts at least on par with last\nyear. There is speculation that the money donated by College to the Union could be up to\n20% less than last year\u2019s allocation.\nHEFC cuts look to be around 7-8% but the\nUnion President is wary of other uncertain\nfactors.\n\u201cThe worst-case scenario is that a new Conservative government comes in and slashes 10%\nacross the board. That\u2019s where the scary prospect of a 20% cut appears. Cameron has said\nthey wouldn\u2019t do that if elected, but we\u2019ll wait\nand see,\u201d he said.\nIt has been said that The Union looks set to\ndecide on an initial 15% reduction across the\nboard in response to financial uncertainty.\nBudgeting officially closes on Monday 8th\nFebruary for all Clubs & Societies, and treasurers are now having to rethink their budgeting strategies for next year under uncertain\ncircumstances regarding the size of cuts further up in Imperial College\u2019s financial pyramid.\nAt the bottom of the pile: Clubs and Societies\nresenting university Vice-Chancellors\nand students have reacted angrily.\nThey described the moves as \u201can\nact of self-harm\u201d and warned that it\ncould have \u201ca dire impact on teaching\nquality.\u201d\nThe University and College General\nSecretary Sally Hunt warned, \u201cIf these\ncuts go ahead the dreams of thousands\nof students, consistently encouraged to\napply to university by the Government,\nwill be shattered. Massive funding cuts\nwill have a massive impact. The sector\nsimply cannot do more for less. Our\nhigher education system is already\ncreaking under the pressure of government efficiency savings.\u201d\nThe Director-General of the Russell Group of twenty leading British\nresearch-led universities, Wendy Piatt, agreed, \u201cOur leading institutions\ncannot continue to be internationally competitive, provide a first-rate\nteaching experience and offer generous support to disadvantaged students without access to increased\nfunding.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for College announced they do not expect the announcements this week to affect the\nintake of students for next year.\n\u201cThe number of new Imperial undergraduate students starting in 2010\nis expected to be much the same as\nin 2009 \u2013 we don\u2019t expect to see an\nincrease. The 2009 u/g entrants were:\n1,575 home/EU, 722 overseas, so a total of just under 2,300,\u201d she said.\nUniversities are also to be fined for\nletting in too many students last year.\nTogether with the new funding cuts, a\n10 per cent increase in applications this\nyear, and the bottleneck from many of\nlast year\u2019s students having been offered\ndeferred entry on the assumptions that\nthe problems were one-offs, this could\nlead to hundreds of thousands of applicants not receiving university places\nthis year.\nProfessor Les Ebdon, chairman\nof Million+, a body that represents\nyounger universities, argued that the\ncuts are \u201ccompletely counter-intuitive.\u201d\nHe also added that \u201cthe evidence\nSina Ataherian reports on the \u00a3518 million cuts on money given to universities by the HEFCE this week\npoints to rising demand but less funding for student support, which the Department for Business, Innovation and\nSkills (BIS) provided to allow 10,000\nadditional students to be recruited in\n2009 has been withdrawn and universities will not have these numbers\navailable for students wishing to start\nuniversity in 2010.\u201d\nThe Government\u2019s Universities Minister David Lammy has responded to\nthe criticisms by claiming that \u201cthere\nhas been a lot of scaremongering\nabout savings we have asked HEFCE\nto make. But we are now confident\nthat HEFCE can achieve these in a way\nthat minimises the impact on teaching and students as we asked for in\nour recent grant letter.\u201d He continued\nby saying that \u201cgoing to university has\nalways been a competitive process.\nIt is essential that we manage growth\nto maintain the quality of our higher\neducation. Even given the increase in\nstudents attending university the ratio\nof lecturers to students is higher today\nthan it was even five years ago.\u201d\nLooking through the responses to\nthis news on the internet, felix has\nfound a generally negative consensus.\nPopular suggestions for alternative\nmeans for the government to cut funds\ninclude targeting them on less academic courses and universities.\nStaying at home: There\u2019ll be less moving-in to do in the next few years if predictions for less student intake is true\nat\nould\nof ap-sity places\non, chairman\ny th\nthat\nat r\nrep\nepresents\nies\ns,\n, argued tha\nhat\nt th\nthe\nete\nely\nly count\nnter\ner i\n-int\nntui\nu tive.\u201d\n\u201d\ned th\nthat \u201cth\nthe\ne ev\nevid\nd\niden\nn\nence\nce\no\neduca\nstudents\nof lecturers\nthan it was ev\nLooking thro\nthis news on the\nt\nfound a generally neg\nPopular suggestions f\nmeans for the government\nin\ni clude targeting them\nm on\ndemi\nmic\nc co\ncour\nurse\nses\ns an\nand\nd universities\ns.\nDan Wan investigates how the Union will act in response to the now necessary College cuts\n\n"

In fact,\nover in America (where the sport\noriginated) the idea of having to ride in\nanything warmer than a pair of board-shorts would be laughable.\nIt will therefore come as a shock to\nmany of you that the European wakeboarding scene flourishes during the\nwinter. The early nights mean that the\nlakes are usually empty but for stu-dents, and the calm winds leave the\nsurface eerily flat, ideal conditions for\nriding. Doubtless, the distinct riding\nstyle seen in UK pro-wakeboarders\nis in some part thanks to how determined they are not to fall!\nImperial wakeboarding continues to\nrun weekly trips throughout the winter months, and it is generally where\nwe see the new guys advance the most.\nThe determination of our members\nto get their weekly adrenaline fix can\nbe measured by the increasing wetsuit thickness seen at the lake, the last\ntrip of term saw snow on the ground\nand a water temperature of less than\n2 degrees! The rate of progress of all\nthe new members is very impressive,\nwith almost all frequently trying rails\nand ramps and some getting fully legit\ntricks dialed already.\nThe club runs an annual trip to\nwarmer climes, having previously been\nto Florida and Turkey. The trip caters\nto people of all abilities, and is an ideal\nopportunity to progress dramatically.\nOur destination this year is once again\nTurkey, we will be leaving on the 27th\nof March and staying at a beautiful lake\ncomplex for a week. The air temperature is usually around 26 degrees, and\nthe water is bathlike. Non-members\nare always welcome ! Interested?

Despite being pitted\nagainst St. Mary\u2019s college \u2013 veterans\nof the sport who had comprehensively\nbeaten IC in their debut game - Imperial were well up for the challenge.\nThe opening half saw some well\ncontested 50-50 balls, and some great\npassing and hassling from Imperial\u2019s\ngirls in blue. Unfortunately, Mary\u2019s skill\nand experience were all too apparent\nas they dropped ball after ball between\nthe posts. But, credit to the girls, not\nonce did the heads go down. A couple\nof rockets were stopped by Goalkeeper\nKatie Cullen, much to the surprise of\nMary\u2019s man-sized power-forward, but\nthe onslaught continued. After a tough\nstart, the girls in blue found their feet;\nsome brilliant clearances from Jane\nBryant at centre back, and great hassling from Tabitha Skinner and Ellie\nHarrison saw Imperial make some\nheadway into the forward line. A fairly\ndirty shoulder-ram gave IC their first\nchance in front of goal-which Eileen\nBrandley converted with ease.\nThe second half continued along the\nsame lines, with some great play and\nclassy passing between the midfield\nand forward lines. Deep winger Eileen\ngot on the end of some well placed\nkick-outs, splitting the defence from\nthe right and slightly stemming the\nflow of scores from Mary\u2019s. Another\nfree kick awarded in front of the posts\nsaw Carla Mulas oblige with a second point for the team deep into the\nsecond half. However, when the final\nwhistle blew, there was no mistaking\nthe winners.\nThe second game saw Imperial take\non a team of similar experience to\nthemselves. Right from the throw in,\nit was clear that this was a whole different ball game. The evenly matched\nsides gave Imperial a chance to show\noff the skills they\u2019d spent the last three\nmonths perfecting. With some great\npassing plays you\u2019d be forgiven for\nthinking the girls had been together\nfor years as opposed to weeks. Halfway\nthrough the first half, a goal-mouth\nscuffle was ended as Chloe McKeon\nfloored the ball into the back of the net,\nand Cath and Carla popped a point\napiece over the bar with aplomb. Cambridge replied with a lucky goal that\njust dropped over the head of keeper\nTabby Skinner in the oversized goals.\nTo give Cambridge their dues, they\nfought hard, and every ball won was\nwon with difficulty (one Cambridge\nplayer came away with a bloodied\nmouth, and another traumatised after\nChloe tried to mount her in a tackle!).\nThree very experienced players on the\nCambridge side ran the pitch, and succeeded in scoring a point in the closing\nminutes of the first half, bringing the\nscore a bit too close for comfort.\nHowever the second half saw Imperial really take control of the pitch in all\nareas. The skill of the three dominant\nCambridge players was no match for\nIC\u2019s evenly spread capability and superior fitness, which drew compliments\nfrom both opposing teams\u2019 trainers.\nCambridge kept the backs busy with\na few breaks towards goal, but were\nquickly cut out by Imperial\u2019s impenetrable defence. One very close call,\na shot on goal, was foiled at the last\nminute by a block down, compliments\nof wing back Tabitha Skinner. Teamed\nwith impressive one-two play between\nCarla, Chloe, Sophie and Scarlett up\nfront, and Cath Parkinson\u2019s beautiful\ncrosses across the goal front, the girls\nkept layering on the pressure. This unyielding barrage of shots gave Imperial\na further 3 points without reply, leaving the full time score Imperial 1-5,\nCambridge 1-1.\nWell done girls, bring on the\nChampionships!\nKatie Cullen Gaelic Football\n\n"

One of these is\nnot having to pay council tax \u2013 you can get an\nexemption certi\ufb01cate from the Student Hub.\nSend this to your local council and then you\nshould be exempt.\nIn an ideal world showing your eligibility for\ncouncil tax exemption should be as simple as\nabove, however in The Advice Centre we see\nmany students who have actually been billed\nfor council tax. Why is this? Below are some of\nthe reasons why students may get billed:\n\u2022 The property the student lives in is also\noccupied by non-students. It is important to\nremember that it is the property that council\ntax applies to, not people, so if a student lives\nwith non-students then the property is only\neligible for a 25% discount.\n\u2022 The council has no proof the student studies\nfull-time. This problem can often occur when\nstudents forget to submit their exemption\ncerti\ufb01cates or in some cases the council\nbelieves the exemption certi\ufb01cate is not\ndescriptive enough.\nTo pay or not to pay\n\u2022 An international student who lives with\ntheir spouse. If the spouse is here on a\nvisa and has no recourse to public funds in\ntheir passport then they should be exempt,\nhowever, the council is likely to still send a bill.\nIf the International student\u2019s spouse is from\nthe EU however then they are eligible to pay\nwith a 25% discount.\n\u2022 PhD students. Some councils this academic\nyear have started to bill postgraduate PhD\nstudents. This is due to a test case in court\nwhere a PhD student in writing up lost an\nappeal. This issue can be appealed however\nand The Advice Centre has had cases of this\noverturned.\n\u2022 Council admin error. There are some instances\nwhere a student can be billed due to an admin\nerror at the council.\nThe rule to go by on council tax issues is that if\nyou are a registered full-time student and you\nare studying over 21 hours a week, then you\nmeet the criteria for council tax exemption. So,\nif you are billed you should approach The Advice\nCentre which can help with this issue for you.\nIt should also be noted that students\nthemselves cannot be pursued for council tax,\nso for example, if the student lives with non-students then it is the non-students who are\npursued.\nIf you \ufb01nd you are having any issues or\nproblems with council tax please do not\nhesitate to contact The Advice Centre:\nEmail: advice@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8067\nDrop in: The Advice Centre, Level 2M, Union\nBuilding, Beit Quad, South Kensington\nCampus.\nThe Graduate Schools\nUniversity Challenge\nEvent\nThursday 18th February 2010\n6pm, G16, SAF Building, South\nKensington\n6pm: Event Starts\n7pm: Drinks and Snacks Reception\nBased on the BBC programme, which is\ncurrently seeing Imperial\u2019s University Challenge\nteam in \ufb01ne form, this event will feature teams\nfrom GSEPS and GSLSM, pitted against one\nanother as they endeavour to triumph in this\nannual event.

    "content": "the river. As the years\nwent on, more and more of an effort\nwas made by the Unions to organise\nsomething special and the event became a bigger RAG event year after\nyear. Here we have the recollections\nfrom the Guilds President in 1963-64,\nand current Professor at the College,\nProf. Bob Schroter.\n\u201cMorphy Day traditionally consisted\nof the constituent colleges, particularly the RCS and the Guilds, having a\nbit of a flour and tomato fight on the\ntowpath. I always remember that there\nwas a young policeman on one of those\nNoddy early motorcycle bike things,\nand that he thought he was going to\nstop this rampaging on the towpath, so\nhe very foolishly rode his motorcycle\ninto the middle of the foray and got to-tally, but totally, plastered in tomatoes\nand flour.\u201d\nDon\u2019t worry though, it turns out that\nthe supervisor of the Policeman was\nalso there, so President Schroter went\nto apologise and offer to pay for the\ndry cleaning, but the Police Officer\u2019s\nresponse was simply that \u201cWell, I think\nhe has learnt to deal with crowd control\u201d. Even the then Rector, Patrick Linstead, who was hugely popular with the\nstudents and got involved with numerous student activities - mainly because\nhe was a student at the University himself - told the Faculty President\u2019s not to\nworry and that everything will be fine.\nFlicking through the felix archive,\nI find that Morphy Day was always a\nsocial highlight of any student\u2019s calen-dar, becoming an integral part of RAG\nWeek, as can be seen in the felix issue\n402 which was a RAG special in 1975.\n10 felix FRIDAY 05 FEBRUARY 2010\nthat race was a Guilds win, even though\nnone of the boats actually reached the\nfinish line after 80 minutes!\nThe race itself grew in importance\nover the years, with coaches being\nbrought in to help the different boat\nclubs for the big day and more races\nintroduced, including a women\u2019s race\nand a Rugby Race. The event was even\nused to unveil a new boat in 1971,\nwhen the then Rector, Lord Penny,\nand his wife came down to watch the\nraces. By the late 1950s, it was considered a great honour to be part of the\nMorphy Crew and, more importantly,\nthe number of spectators on the banks\nof the Thames increased, both student\nand local resident!\nAs the 1960s came about, the focus\nof the event, however, began to shift\nmore towards the towpath instead of\nthe event. There was always a large\nturnout of supporters from all three\ncolleges on the towpath for this race\nand a fair scuffle normally developed\nto secure possession of the other colleges trophies and protect the Guild\u2019s\ntrophy spanner!\u201d\nIn one clean swoop, we see the day\nbring together the sporting rivalry as\nwell as the mascotry. To begin with,\nthe day was all about the race itself, the\nsporting rivalry, but as the years went\non, the riverside antics increased and\nthe Cup changed into a Day where they\nfought for the Morphy Oar. That\u2019s not\nto say that the race itself was not inter-esting, take the account of the race in\nthe very first issue of felix back in 1949,\nwhere they had to restart the race\nseveral times because the boats kept\ncrashing into each other. The result of\nA\ns some of you may know,\nImperial was founded\nwhen three different\ncollege\u2019s joined together\nback in 1907; the Royal\nCollege of Science (RCS), the Royal\nSchool of Mines (RSM) and the City\nand Guilds College (C&G). There was\na sense of belonging, a sense of identity\nto the constituent College\u2019s and rivalry\nthat puts the current IC vs Medics one\nto shame. This rivalry, much like the\nVarsity matches of today, was focused\naround sports, however it was not\nexclusively left to the sports field, the\nrivalry also extended to the mascotry,\nbut that\u2019s another story for another\ntime.\nThis sporting rivalry was personified\nnot on the fields of Harlington, but the\nmuddy waters of the Thames; Morphy\nDay was, first and foremost, a boat race\n(yes probably both definitions). The\nday itself comprised of two races, the\nLowry Cup was effectively the seconds\ncrew, whilst the Morphy Cup was for\nthe best rowers in the College.\nLooking through the felix archive, I\neventually came to a description of the\nvery first race, written by David Hopkins in 1975.\n\u201cOn the 21st March 1920, an RSM\nrowing eight beat C&G over a one\nmile course; this was the first time the\ncolleges had raced since the revival of\ntheir individual rowing clubs after the\n1st World War. Mr Arthur Morphy,\nfather of the Guilds\u2019 stroke, Donald W\nMorphy, presented a cup which he had\ndonated for the occasion.\u201d\nD.W. Morphy was an Electrical Engineering student at the College and\nbecame a keen Old Centralian after he\nleft the College, even when his com-pany, Morphy Richards (you might of\nheard of them), became big.\nThere have been many recollections\nof the day in the felix and College ar-chives, including video footage of the\nrace in 1929 and this one on the IC\nBoat Clubs website by E. J. Cove, a Mechanical Engineering student between\n1942-45.\n\u201cApart from being Secretary of ICBC\nI was Captain of the C&GBC which\nreally had no separate existence apart\nfrom the Morphy race which Guilds\nwon both times I rowed in it.

It is much more informal\nthan the original event, and used primarily as a means of incorporating\nnovice and senior men\u2019s and women\u2019s\ncrews in a boat together. Although\ninter-faculty rivalry is not as intense\nas it was in the prime Morphy years,\nloyalty to Imperial as a single entity is\nunwavering.\nTypically it\u2019s 07:20 am, -2 \u00b0C outside\nand crews have already been over an\nhour on the water. Sydney Olympic\nGold Medallist and ICBC Head Coach\nSteve Trapmore is in a launch shouting instructions from a megaphone as\nthe boat enters the final few minutes\nof a high intensity piece under Hammersmith Bridge. Hamstrings are\ncrying in pain, fingers are numb from\nthe sub-zero water splashing over\nthe inboard and minds are beginning\nto drift. The cox calls for more; you\nthink you have nothing left to give.\nAnd just then an exhausted voice\n(probably Alex Gillies), barely audi-ble, comes wafting from the bows\nof the boat, \u201cCome on IC!\u201d The mere\nmention of those two letters; \u201cI-C\u201d\nand the boat surges on with renewed\nenergy. Limp bodies are suddenly\nbolt upright, blades are speared into\nthe water and Steve in the coaching\nlaunch has to flood the engine to\nkeep up.

    "content": "This tradition of Morphy Day and\nRAG continued throughout the 1960s,\n1970s and early 1980s, when all of a\nsudden, it just seemed to vanish in the\nlate 1980s.\nWhat effectively seemed to hap-pen, as the years went on, was that\ntwo separate Morphy Days devel-oped, a Boat Club one and a RAG one.\nIt is the RAG one that seemed to get\nworse as the years went on. The first\ntime Morphy Day was cancelled was\nin 1971, when a paper was presented\nto the Union Council suggesting that\nit was \u201cinconsistent for students who\nwanted to show that they were responsible adults to disrupt traffic and generally behave in an anti-social manner.\u201d\nIt was eventually brought back in 1973,\nalthough the races carried on through\nthis ban. 12 years later, the event was\nbanned again after it was deemed that\nthe battles were again getting a bit out\nof hand, considering they were using \u201c\nbuckets of rotting fish and refuse\u201d instead of the flour and tomatoes of previous years, it is not a suprise.\nThey tried to change the format but\nas a result the day lost its potency and\neventually dropped all together as a\nRAG event in 1988 after it was deemed\nunpopular. Despite the antics on the\ntowpath, the outcome of the races was\nfiercely cheered even up until its end,\nyet once the event was dropped, so did\nthe crowds attending and it seems that\nrace itself died out. There just seems\nto be no reference of the Cup from the\n1990s onwards.\n22 years on, and what has happened\nThe policeman covered in tomatoes\nand flour in 1963\n11\nfelix FRIDAY 05 FEBRUARY 2010\nto this once historic event? No one\nseems to know of it anymore, yet out\nof the College\u2019s 103 year history, Morphy Day was the highlight for 68 years.\nWhen E.J. Cove came back to Imperial for a visit, he said that he was\nshocked that no one knew about the\nrace and how it died out. The whereabouts of the Cup itself is a mystery, but\nthe Morphy Oar, or at least part of it,\nwhich everyone fought over on the\ntowpath can be found residing in the\nGuilds Office.\nBut it seems that not all is lost. A\ncouple of years ago the Imperial Boat\nClub ran a series of races in which the\nstudents were split into their Faculties,\nand they even included the Medical\nSchool. The same was done the following year. The Morphy Cup, it seems,\nhas made a very quiet comeback.\nBack in the day, almost a third of the\nstudents at the University would descend upon the Thames to watch the\nrace and take part in some light-heart-ed entertainment. Would the same\nhappen again? Well getting a third of\nthe University would be very impres-sive, it would match the crowds for\nthe Oxford vs Cambridge Boat Race.\nPersonally, I can\u2019t see that many people bothering to make the trip to the\nThames on a cold winters day, but then\nagain, that\u2019s how Morphy Day started\nin the first place. Who knows, 20 years\ndown the line the columns of felix\nmight be covering the phenomena that\nis Morphy Day. Or then again it might\nbe covering the event that was Morphy\nDay. Only time can tell.\nOne of the Sabbaticals getting\ncovered in crap in the 1980s\nDanny Rice comments on\nliving with a disability\nE\narlier this week I was asked\nto write this article on dis-ability. Why? Because I have\na one. I\u2019m not sure why this\nqualifies me to speak on behalf of everyone with a disability but\napparently it does.\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to write about?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you want; discrimination,\nhow some disabilities aren\u2019t obvious, how\npeople with disabilities are the same as\neveryone else or how they\u2019re not and we\nshould recognise this...\u201d\nI didn\u2019t reply then. I wasn\u2019t sure what to\nsay at the time. I thought long and hard\nabout what issues I would address, what\nmessage I wanted to give and here is my\nresponse:\nFuck off \u2013 everyone has something going on in their life, a disability is of no\ngreater significance than anyone else\u2019s\nproblems. The only difference is it\u2019s just\nmore permanent.\nI don\u2019t need to be singled out or recognised because of it. I don\u2019t need your\npity or you treating me like I\u2019m made of\nglass. By all means try to be conscious of\nmy limitations to not make yourself look\nstupid but I\u2019m just another human being\n\u2013 and that\u2019s how I\u2019d like to be treated; not\nthe same as everyone else, not different,\nbut with the same level of custom consideration for what really matters that you\u2019d\nshow the next person. I don\u2019t understand\nhow some people can find this so hard!\nYou need be no more nice to the guy in\nthe wheelchair than you are to the next\nable-bodied person you meet. Or perhaps this advice is better in reverse? Be\nas nice to the next able-bodied person\nyou meet as you feel you should the guy\nin the wheelchair \u2013 for all you know, the\nable-bodied individual may have more\nproblems.\nLong-term disabled individuals go\nthrough a period of acceptance where\nthey recognise their limitations and develop an arsenal of strategies for overcoming them. The thing that makes this\nperiod of their lives hardest is the awareness of no matter where they go they\u2019re\ngoing to meet people who feel sorry for\nthem or decide it\u2019d be \u2018rude\u2019 to include\nthem in the random selection of an individual for a task, lest it appear like they\nwere singled out or otherwise feel \u2018whilst\nnot impossible this would be harder for\nthem, therefore I should choose someone\nelse\u2019. The way people avoid giving you\nresponsibilities (for no reason other than\nyou possess a disability) can make you\nfeel useless.\nPerhaps you think you\u2019d love all that\nattention though? The way people buzz\naround you trying to make your life com-fortable? If you were actually experiencing it, the attraction of this idea to you\nwould wither fast. Particularly when your\ndisability is developed into this barrier\nthat prevents people from talking to you.\nI would hate to have a disability as visible\nas being in a wheelchair, where it doesn\u2019t\nmatter how old you get, there\u2019ll always be\nsome well-intentioned person who will\ntreat you like you\u2019re still a child or people\nthat \u2018don\u2019t want to bother you\u2019.\nThen there are the people that believe\nthemselves as good as, if not better, than\nall the doctors and specialists in deciding\nyour needs and resent you for the assistance and aid you attract, \u201cWhy does he\nneed all that stuff? He doesn\u2019t look that\nbad.\u201d\nThis is not to say it is always necessary\nin every case but from time to time, doctors will come across someone and recognise just how little there is that they\ncan do to address their actual problems\nand so the help is offered in other areas to\ntry to reduce the strain.\nYet others feel they must look on and\nconstantly be judging these decisions; deciding for themselves whether or not the\nindividual\u2019s visible burdens are enough to\n\u2018deserve it\u2019. Which is fine but then they\nwill go on to resent the individual for\naccepting what to them could be a rare,\nsoul-lifting break. Consider your last big\nproblem, then imagine it was a perpetual\ndaily occurrence/pressure (perhaps it\nwas/is \u2013 I\u2019m sure you coped, are coping\nfine or else are aware of the many people\nwhose job it is to help you with absolutely\nany problem you have though. i.e. your\ntutors to some extent, the college coun-sellors, your GP etc.), then imagine someone came along and offered you something to make life generally easier, would\nyou not accept it?\nOf course there has to be some moderation and consideration. As part of my\ncondition, I suffer from a constant headache I try to control every day without\ndosing myself routinely with drugs. Some\ndays I can barely function because of it.\nTo partly address this I was once offered\nsomeone to sit in my lectures for me to\ntake notes! I declined; most of the time\nthis is something I\u2019m able to do and I\nrecognise the absurdity in the notion of\ntrying to make my life as normal as possible without putting in effort. Sure, some\nthings can and will be harder for me but\nI have successfully fought for my independence in these areas and I\u2019d like to\nkeep it that way and not make the incapable image others may have of me a reality.\nAs unsure as I was on how to begin this\narticle am I on how to end it. I\u2019m not suggesting you run out and befriend the next\none-armed, paraplegic dwarf, neither am\nI saying you should aim to walk by them\nand given them no notice (as you might\nsomeone of a more typical appearance).\nI\u2019ve highlighted the troubles of a particular sub-group of society, not to draw attention to them but to show how they\u2019re\njust people, like the rest of the human\nrace they\u2019re just trying to get through life,\nplaying out the hand they were dealt as\nbest they can.\nI\u2019m saying we should all try to be a little less discriminatory; if you\u2019re going\nto give the disabled guy extra attention,\ndon\u2019t ignore everyone else \u2013 get to know\nsomeone you pass in the corridors every\nday but normally don\u2019t typically say more\nthan two words to, give some other people the attention for a change, get some in\nreturn and perhaps there\u2019s something to\ngain out of us just making that little bit\nmore effort with people.\nYou may have noticed I\u2019ve neglected to\nmention precisely what my condition is. I\nhave done this intentionally, as I want to\nask you to ask yourselves \u2013 does it matter?\n\u201cBe as nice to the\nnext able-bodied\nperson you meet as\nyou feel you should\nto the guy in the\nwheelchair\u201d\nFEATURE\nfeatures.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nONE WORLD WEEK\nThe RSM crew at the 2009 Morphy Race\n\n"

Wow!\nThat surely must have been a\nbit awkward?\nHitler: Spielberg is a nice guy.\nWe both just sort of laughed\nat the irony of us working\ntogether.\nHangman: So what\u2019s the film\nabout?\nHitler: It\u2019s a sort of cross between E.T and Indiana Jones.\nI play a gay alien teacher who\nhas to escape from a pit of\nsnakes, whilst struggling to\naccept his sexuality. It\u2019s a really\nmoving film.\nHangman: So have you seen\nthe film Inglourious Basterds?\nHitler: Yeah, like fifteen times!\nI love Tarantino!

I was banned from\nCounter-Strike for using an\naimbot though.\nHangman: So you\u2019re a PC\ngamer? Please don\u2019t tell us\nyou have a World of Warcraft\naccount.\nHitler: The game has a bad rep,\nbut it\u2019s not as geeky as people\nthink.

I was so\nnervous when I first met her,\nshe\u2019s such a big star now, but\nwe really hit it off. The song is\nreally meaningful to both of\nus - we both hate people getting in our way. For Taylor it\nwas Kanye West, for me it was\nBelgium. I think people can\nrelate to that.\nHangman: So what do you\nthink of Kanye West?\nHitler: The guy is a dick. It\u2019s\nunforgivable.

It\u2019s that time every Imperial student dreads: when the stewards\nusher you out of the mediocre establishment that is Da Vinci\u2019s bar and\ninto dBs, what has been unanimously-judged by students as an appalling attempt at a \u2018nightclub.\n\u2019 Staggering across\nthe Union, cheesy flashing disco lights\nand ill-judged drum and bass meet\nscrums of people in drunken mob-men-tality fighting for yet another drink at\nthe one small bar dBs nightclub houses.\nAnother drunkenly-torrid (but cheap)\nWednesday night rolls on once again.\nThis is a typical Wednesday night for\nmany a student at Imperial.\nIn the last few weeks, Imperial College Union President, Ashley Brown\nand his team have announced the imminent \u00a32.4 million renovation of the\nUnion\u2019s nightlife venues. By the new\nacademic year, a typical Wednesday\nnight will hopefully play out something\ncloser to:\nIt\u2019s Wednesday night and you\u2019re not\npaying too much attention to the time.\nIt\u2019s that time every Imperial student is\nwarmly familiar with; the barman calls\nfor last orders in [a new student-chosen\nbar name] bar. There isn\u2019t any need to\nmake the last-minute dash for another\npint there, so you drunkenly skip across\nthe Union into the newly-opened [a new\nstudent-chosen venue name] nightclub.\nThe reverberating bass line meets the\nlambent lights from an extensive bar\narea, and that girl you\u2019ve smiled at in\nlectures is casually leaning up against\nit. A barman looks over to you to see\nwhat you fancy, and a brilliant (and\ncheap) Wednesday night at the Union\nrolls on once again.\nThat\u2019s the plan, anyway. The official\nname for this plan is Phase 3. Whilst\nPhase 1 and 2 saw the refurbishment of\nthe Union offices, reception and activity spaces, the final phase of the Union\u2019s\nrevamp of their Beit Quad building is\nthe one the vast majority of students\nhave spent years waiting for. Freshers\nwill be astounded and impressed, and\njust maybe they won\u2019t come to the same\nconclusion that we all did two weeks\ninto our first years: \u201cThe Union is shit\u201d\n.\nTo make sure those words are never\nuttered again in South Kensington,\nthis year\u2019s team of sabbatical officers have made sure Phase 3 has been\nentirely student-led. From initial design plans to giving the new bars their\nnames, student views and ideas have\nbeen on the forefront of this project.\nDuring November of last year, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) Daniel\nHill spent time in the Junior Common\nRoom extensively talking to students\nabout what was wrong with the Union\nbars\u2019 current set-up. The Union have\neven taken the brave decision to hand\nover the naming rights to the students\nby running a \u201cRename the Bars\u201d competition with felix.\nThe Union has continued to keep\nTHE UNION ALLOWS STUDENTS FULL-VIEW OF THE\nONGOING 3RD PHASE OF BEIT\u2019S REDEVELOPMENTS\nYour chance to name the new venues\nthis costly refurbishment as transparent to the students as possible. Felix was curious what was happening\nwith the \u00a32.4million so asked for 3D\nconcept designs, and the Union were\nhappy to oblige. Daniel Hill, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) ex-plains: \u201cThis phase will have a lot more\nstudent involvement as it\u2019s more front-facing. We\u2019ve got everyone\u2019s feedback.\u201d\nThe Union have also set up a Phase\n3 blog and are encouraging Twitter-led\nfeedback (add #phase3 to your tweets)\nto keep students up to date with the\nlatest developments on what they describe as a \u201cmuch needed\u201d renova-tion. There is an element of \u2018don\u2019t say\nwe didn\u2019t ask\u2019 about the ethos of these\naccessories as students are encouraged\nto keep providing feedback on what\nthe Union posts on the blog, found on\nthe Union website.\nIt is clear the people working on\nPhase 3 are immensely proud of their\nprogress so far, and are not scared to\nplace potential stumbling blocks out\ninto the public domain via their blog.\nThe first of the inevitably long list of\nsolutions needed to be found for problems during the planning stages is that\nof a load-bearing steel pillar directly in\nview of a newly-positioned stage in the\nnightclub currently dubbed dBs. The\nblog states that: \u201cThe pillar obscures\npart of the stage area and could be a\nproblem when it comes to hosting live\nbands in the new nightclub.\u201d After providing images of the pillar\u2019s position-ing, they pass over the question quite\nclearly to the student body to answer:\n\u201cDo we really need to spend the time\nand money on removing this pillar?\nWill this pillar prevent bands from\ntouring this venue?\u201d\n\u201cStudents are\nencouraged to\nkeep providing\nfeedback.\u201d\nThe Union are handing over the responsibility of coming up with names for the renovated bar and\nnightclub, currently known as Da Vinci\u2019s and dBs, to the students. It\u2019s your chance to have a bit of fun\nand make your mark on Imperial\u2019s history in quite a big way.\nThe Rename the Bars competition will be implemented with an open suggestion box for names for\nboth the bar and nightclub, then the Union President and his team will shortlist five names picked\nfrom the suggestions. The final decision is handed back to the students as they vote in an online poll on\nfelixonline.co.uk from 18th February. So, have a good name for the Union\u2019s venues? See below.\nSend in your name suggestions for\n1. The new nightclub (currently dBs)\n2. The new bar (currently Da Vinci\u2019s)\nto\nrenamethebars@imperial.ac.uk\nor use #phase3 in your tweets DAN WAN REPORTS\n\n"

In the past, volunteers have\ngotten dressed in lycra, as busty nurses\nand even creepy clowns. Your imagination is the limit, so best start thinking\nabout your costumes now. Your group\nwill be given a sheet of challenges to\ncomplete, such as pretending to have\na group orgasm in a fast food chain or\nto permanently \u201cborrow\u201d an item from\nKings, UCL or LSE. This event is our\nbiggest of the year, so you and your\nfriends should definitely check it out!\nALL the profits from the raid will go\ntowards Broadway Homelessness and\nSupport, a relatively new homelessness\ncharity whos vision is that \u201cevery person finds and keeps a home\u201d. As well as\nsupporting the homeless with practical\nhelp, advice and training, Broadway\nconducts research into the homelessness sector, \u201cseeking to influence policy and practice by contributing to a\ngreater understanding of homelessness\nand social exclusion\u201d. Definitely worth\nraiding London for!\nGirls! At UCL! In corsets! Well, maybe not corsets, but the prospect of UCL is pretty exciting. Oh wait, no the girls are\n\n"

I merely\nwanted to show you a new product that I\nthought might be of interest to you.\nOh, well, if you put it like that.\nThank you, Sir.\nNot at all. Would you mind loosening\nyour grip on my scarf just a bit, I\u2019m finding it rather difficult to breathe.\nIt\u2019s an exclusive new release, Sir, on an\nitem that is bound to take the country\nby storm.\nNo, really, I can feel myself rapidly\ndrifting out of consciousness.\nOh I am sorry, Sir \u2013 I am so terribly\nclumsy sometimes. As I was saying, by\nhaving the financial acumen to shop\nat this illustrious high street purveyor\nof goods, you have been granted the\nunique opportunity to try out free samples of the hottest product in the European market today.\nIsee,<cough>.And,uh,what<cough>\nwould that be?\nMay I present to you, Sir, the Modern\nPurchase Intermediator \u2013 as he stands\nbefore you now.\nA Purchase Intermediator?\nThat\u2019s absolutely correct, Sir - how\nperceptive of you to notice the distinction between the Purchase Intermediator\u2019 of today and the \u2018Product Salesman\u2019\n.\nof the last millenium. The progress\nmade in this field has been truly dramatic given the short space of time we\u2019ve\nhad to work with.\nHas it.\nOh yes indeed, Sir. The old Salesmen,\nfor instance, had the fundamental flaw\nof being available only in an uninspiring monochrome pinstripe suit. Today\u2019s\nPurchase Intermediators have far more\nflexibility in the sartorial domain, coming in a wide variety of clothing including casual T-shirts underneath tweed\nblazers, torn jeans with leather jackets,\nthree-piece suits with fluorescent neckties and four distinct colours of Adidas\ntrainers.\nI see. And is that better?\nBetter? Oh, but Sir, there\u2019s simply no\ncomparison.\nIsn\u2019t there?\nWhy no! How can a person ever hope\nto Intermediate Purchases to a client\u2019s\nsatisfaction if he must remain rigidly\nconfined in antiquated haberdashery? It\nsays so right here on the label.\nRight. And what is it, exactly, which\nI\u2019m currently entitled to a free sample of\nto for then?\nWhy bless you, Sir \u2013 to this.\nThis?\nBut of course \u2013 this is your opportunity to see the Purchase Intermediator\nin action. To watch how he operates and\nto see whether he could fit into the busy\nlifestyle Sir clearly enjoys on his large\nand prosperous pig farm.\nI...\nOr is it a tanning business, Sir? I do\napologise \u2013 my sense of smell is not what\nit used to be. In either case, Sir, our policy here at Salesbury\u2019s has always been:\n\u2018Offer Our Clients an Informed Choice\u2019\n.\nAnd if the choice is between myself and\na Product Salesman, Sir, I don\u2019t think\nyou need me to tell you which is the\nmore informed.\nSo what exactly would I be using you\nfor?\nHeavens to Betsy, Sir, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t\nknow where to begin. We can perform\nany of a hundred and one different\nsmall jobs around the house more efficiently and with fewer casualties than\nany of your common or garden variety\neggplants.\nEggplants?\nEggplants? Did I mean eggplants? Oh\nno, my apologies, Sir \u2013 I meant house-wives. One of the things on which we\npride ourselves is our flexibility.\nSo I would be getting a Salesman...\n...a Purchase Intermediator, Sir,\nplease...\n...a Purchase Intermediator, then, because he would be more flexible than my\nwife?\nI think, if I may be so bold, that Sir\nis rapidly getting hold of what could\nalmost certainly be described as the\nwrong end of the stick. What we do is\nprovide our clients with an unparalleled\ndegree of enhanced positivity. We detoxify the inherent stress in Sir\u2019s enervated ganglions and channel the resultant symmetry into nodal field waves of\nradiative harmony.\nOh. Right.\nWe happen to have received an entirely new shipment of Purchase Intermediators today, Sir, all of whom are in\nour back room simply aching to come\nout and Intermediate like billy-o.\nWhere do you get these Intermediators from, then?\nOh, we fly them in directly from\nLA three times a week. No expense is\nspared in providing you with the Intermediation service you deserve. Our\nInspiration, if you would turn to the\nsecond page of your leaflet, Is Your\nIntermediation.\nI see. Well, thank you very much for\nthe presentation, it was really very informative and I say would you mind\nsqueezing a little less forcefully with\nyour thighs I\u2019m sure I just heard something snap.\nBut Sir \u2013 you haven\u2019t even asked me\nhow much our services cost, yet.\nI\u2019m fairly certain something in my ribcage has just broken.\nThat\u2019s absolutely correct, Sir - all\nthese unique, irreplaceable services can\nbe yours for the price of an old Toyota\nPrius.\nI think I\u2019ve lost most of the feeling in\nmy left arm.\nAnd I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t need me to\ntell you that on the open market we\u2019re\nvalued considerably more highly. So tell\nme, Sir, do we have a deal?\nPlease, just let go of my arm and you\ncan keep my wallet.\nOh, that\u2019s very generous, Sir, but this is\nall we need. Thank you very much \u2013 I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ll agree this Purchase can be\nconsidered thoroughly Intermediated.\nCan I go now?\nI don\u2019t know, Sir \u2013 can you?\n...no.\nAh.\nB\nBC News is widely considered to be the rock of British journalism. It is one of\nthe finest broadcasting\ninstitutions in the world\nand I think of it as one of the quintessential sources of global news. So\nwhen the two most read articles on\nthe BBC News website are about Jordan\u2019s marriage and John Terry\u2019s affair,\nI was thoroughly outraged. Somehow,\nthe stories more akin to the allure of\nthe Sun\u2019s page 3 has managed to make\nit to one of the most respected news\noutlets in the world. It seems that\npeople care more about big boobs\nand the pulling prowess of a footballer\nthan people dying in Iraq.\nIn the past few months, two sex\nscandals have rocked the celebrity obsessed world of Heat magazine \u2013 Tiger Woods and John Terry. Both are\nworld class sportsmen, earning millions and living the luxurious life of\na modern sportsman. Both also have\nscintillatingly beautiful wives and enviable families. However, both men\nhave, in the words of a good friend of\nmine \u201clost the control of the lower half\nof their body\u201d. Personally, I couldn\u2019t\ncare less what Woods or Terry gets up\nto off the field and I think the majority of the public also couldn\u2019t care less.\nI think if John Terry captains England\nto World Cup victory this summer,\nno-one would care that he has slept\nwith more women than a porn star.\nSimilarly if Tiger Woods beats Jack\nNicklaus\u2019 record of 18 Golf Majors,\nhe would dominate the front pages for\nvery different reasons.\nThe argument goes that they are\nmore than sportsmen, they are role\nmodels for the public and their public image is just as important as their\nsporting achievements. Unfortunately\nthe fundamental flaw in that argument\nis that there is a microscopically small\nchance that anybody will copy every\naspect of a celebrity\u2019s life.\nChildren and teenagers are most\nlikely to be influenced by what they see\nand hear in the media, but it would be\ninsulting to presume that all of them\nhave no sense of judgement. If people\nare afraid that children will think that\ncheating and being promiscuous is\ncool due to the fact that their sporting\nheroes do it, then they are more naive\nand ignorant than those very children.\nTo quote \u201cThe West Wing\u201d, \u201cshow\nthe average teenager a picture of a\n[tyre] wrench and his thoughts will\nturn to lust\u201d I think teenagers do not\nrequire a promiscuous celebrity before\nthey become promiscuous themselves.\nThere is a nagging inconsistency in\nboth scandals. Aided by the sensationalism of the Sun and the machine\nthat is the \u201cScrew of the World\u201d (News\nof the World), suddenly a plethora of\nwomen have come out claiming they\nhave \u201crode and conquered\u201d the sporting icons. Furthermore, the actual af-fair/one night stand happened several\nmonths ago. It begs the question \u201cWhy\nnow?\u201d and while some may be genuine others are just opportunistic. This\nis the point where I actually feel a bit\nsorry for Woods and Terry. You see\nthe difference between sporting celebrities and Hollywood celebrities is that\nmost sporting stars have talent while\nmost Hollywood stars have talented\nlooks.\nThe devastating trifecta of Sex,\nScandal and the Sun have robbed England of a great player, and maybe even\nthe World Cup and the golfing world\nof an all time legend. Meanwhile, the\n\u201cguilt-ridden\u201d women will have earned\na handy sum of money, got their \u201c15\nminutes of fame\u201d and obtained a career being a professional celebrity,\nwith magazine shoots by Nuts (case in\npoint, Rebecca Loos).\nI think the men, the women and\nthe tabloids are all relatively blame-less. The real culprits are the general\npublic. The truth is, the public despite\nthe fact that they hate it, have an insatiable appetite for sex scandals. It\nfuels the tabloids, drives the women\nto drool over any celebrity and culminated in the celebrity obsessed age\nthat we are in today. It is only human\nto make a mistake in any situation but\nfor someone like John Terry, a mistake\nsparks the inevitable fires of a sensational scandal.\n\u201cThe devastating\ntrifecta of Sex,\nScandal and the\nSun have robbed us\nof a great player \u201d\nKen Wu discusses media sex sensationalism\n\u201cToday\u2019s Purchase\nIntermediators\nhave far more\nflexibility \u201d\n\n"

The letters and drawings\nof any artist or writer (or both) are collected together and made into an ar-chive, which as an entity of its own becomes something to be treasured and\nexplored. So these things that started\nas just demotic letters and scribbles\nto family and friends are today pored\nover by thousands at the Royal Academy. Walter Benjamin was both a superb and diligent penman, whose letters themselves became a work of art\n- each script minute and beautiful in its\nentirety. I hope there will be an exhibition of his writing at some point soon!\nMy statement, over-clich\u00e9d, of\ncourse - that \u2018the pen is mightier\u2019 - is\nverified by another guest contributer,\nAndy Dolan, in a further addition\nto our \u2018Why I Like...\u2019 feature series.\nMiller\u2019s dark graphics bring to life the\ndrawing on the page, with his popular\nand inspiring comics.\nSo the start to the new year has been\nsomewhat slow for art exhibitions in\nthe capital in my opinion. However,\nthings should be hotting up towards\nthe end of the month. This weekend I\nam definitely planning to trek down to\nthe South London Gallery, to see \u2018Art\nBin\u2019 - another one of those exhibitions\nthat intends to \u2018shake things up\u2019 in the\nart world; works of artists (some un-known, others very familiar - like our\nold friend Damien Hirst for example),\nare to be \u2018given\u2019 to the gallery space,\nnay, chucked into a perspex pit where\nthey will accumulate until the space is\nfilled. The curator Michael Landy has\npromised not to take advantage of this\naccumulation of what is theoretically a\npile of gold, speaking in market terms,\nand all the works will be destroyed at\nthe end of the show.\nThinking then, about the value invested in Van Gogh\u2019s personal scribbles compared to works of art that are\nbeing just thrown away raises some interesting issues about the structure of\ncontemporary vision.\nVan Gogh, intimately\nRox Middleton on the letters of an extraordinary artist at the RA.\nWhy the pen is\nfar mightier\nRosieMilton\nRosieMilton Arts Editor\nI\n\u2019ll admit I went to this exhibition with sky-high expectations.\nVan Gogh is my favourite artist\nand this show is the first major London one for forty years;\namazingly, it didn\u2019t disappoint me. The\ngallery chronicles his ten year career,\nusing letters alongside 95 drawings\nand paintings. The premise is that the\nletters give an insight into the artist\u2019s\n\u2018complex mind\u2019, but I think it misrepresents them to call them complex. The\nthousands of letters he wrote to his\nsiblings and friends are less exciting\nthan you might imagine. Rather than\ncontaining surreal hidden meanings,\nthey are extraordinary only in their do-mesticity, precisely recording technical\ndetails and requesting pencils; it turns\nout the motivation behind most of his\nworks was simply that he really wanted\nto draw and paint. A lot.\nIn 1880, when Van Gogh gave up\nhis mission helping Belgian miners\nas a zealous preacher in order to become an artist, he made up for what\nhe lacked in talent with his enormous\nfervour and dogged hard work. So, the\nexhibition starts off cataloguing his\nlargely self-taught improvement by\ndisplaying his earliest works. Whilst\nthere are some lovely drawings, his\ninexperience shows; his portraits are\nrather lifeless and his first paintings\nfairly dull and plain. The breakthrough\nit seems came in 1885, after five years\npractise, when his painstaking compo-sition, The Potato Eaters, was slated by\nhis friends. This painful set-back gave\nhim a kick \u2013 having lived back at his\nparents\u2019 home for two years, he moved\nback out and went to Paris; he met other artists and his skill leapt forwards.\nHe experimented with pointillism,\nimpressionism, Japanese style and his\nvibrantly pulsing colour and suddenly\nhis work comes into its own. However\nmuch you know about art, the display\nin the gallery marks out these influences very cleverly with some of the\nprints and magazine pictures he liked\nand stuck on bits of card. It\u2019s especially\ninteresting to see how the artist was incongruously inspired to make his busy,\nthickly painted canvasses by the fine\nlines and open space of Japanese artists like Hokusai.\nIn 1888, Van Gogh moved to Provence, and there he stayed for two\nyears, producing some of his best\nknown and loved paintings. There is\nno substitute for seeing these originals\nfor real, prints just can\u2019t capture their\nextraordinary essence and vitality, the\nmagnificent rushing landscapes, swirling mountains and achingly bright\nlandscapes. The art just speaks for it-self, and this is a wonderful chance to\nsee it brought together.\nBut if it speaks for itself, what\u2019s the\npoint of the letters? Well, you can ignore them, but I think that they really\nconvey Van Gogh\u2019s energy and passion for art, even before he\u2019d learnt\nto capture it in his work. That brings\nto life the early studies, whose significance might otherwise be lost. As ever,\nVan Gogh\u2019s eventual suicide is terribly\npoignant, and is brought into sharp relief with his cheerful coherent letters;\nhis paintings were by no means the\nwild outpourings of a troubled mind.\nHis letters are humanising, and he describes his belief in figurative art\u2019s ability to picture things as they really are,\nnot how a camera captures reality, but\nhow we experience it, which is more\nimportant. I think for that claim, his\nwork is the best evidence we\u2019ve got.\nThe Real Van Gogh: The Artist and\nHis Letters is showing at the Royal\nAcademy of Arts until 18 April 2010.\nNearest tube: Picadilly Circus; Green\nPark. Price \u00a38 for students.\nS\no I won\u2019t get into an argument about why comics,\nor graphic novels to give\nthem their \u2018grown up\u2019 title,\nare art. I promised myself I\nwouldn\u2019t because the people who say\nthat graphic novels are not art are the\nsame people who say no good music\nhas been made since the \u201860s, or worse,\nsince Antonio Stradivari died. New\nthings take time to become classics, I\nwonder if there were people like this\nyears ago who said, \u2018Verily Mozart is a\nmost irksome modern sound, I yearn\ngreatly for the familiar sound of my\nchildhood zither.\u2019 You are that person.\nGraphic Novels are art because I said\nso. Shut up and read.\nSo now I introduce to you Frank\nMiller (wait for applause). He has\nshaped the modern graphic novel with\nthe now widely disseminated idea of\nthe flawed hero; it has even reached\nHollywood, who of course did their\nbest to butcher it. Further to this he\nwas also seminal in the development of\nmore adult themes and stories in the\nmedium, leading to the dark and gritty\n(a horribly overused term) novels we\nsee today.\nTo contextualise this in a manner to\nwhich you artistes and thespians may\nrelate, Frank Miller is to the modern\ngraphic novel as Wilkie Collins/Edgar\nAllen Poe (delete as you see fit) is to\ndetective fiction. In the late \u201850s and\n\u201860s the medium was dominated by\nthe clean cut, classic hero, for example\nSpiderman: \u2018With great power comes\ngreat responsibility\u2019, the early title The\nAmazing Spiderman and the idea of a\n\u2018Friendly Neighbourhood Spiderman\u2019,\nnot to mention the cheesy do-gooder\ncomments that litter his speech and\nthoughts. These themes were very\nmuch a result of the empowerment\nand invincibility that America felt after World War 2. Miller\u2019s early work on\nDaredevil (#158, 1979 onward) were\nhis first major pieces as an artist and\nthey were at the forefront of the movement towards the darker themes pervading comics of the era as the Cold\nWar heightened into the \u201880s and the\nglobal fears of war, instability and armageddon were reflected in graphic\nnovels of the time.\nThe art style of Frank Miller is much\nevident in the films of his which you\nmay have seen. Much of his artwork\nfrom the late \u201880s onwards uses the film\nnoir style to add the correct mood to\nthe adult themes he wrote about. The\nuse of silhouette is a common device in\nthis style - this is particularly beneficial\nwhen publishing as serialised comics\nas it dramatically cuts down the time\nrequired for colouring, however it also,\nmore importantly, is used to draw attention to the background of the panel\nby rendering the foreground character\ndarkened. I find the artwork in Miller\u2019s\nwork on Batman and Sin City to be the\nmost compelling; Daredevil\u2019s red costume is a little garish, however it noticeably darkens as Miller\u2019s time there\npasses. The setting of Batman is ideal\nto be rendered in an essentially black\nand white fashion with flashes of col-our. The impact factor of the sudden\nappearance of colour can be quite dramatic - think Schindler\u2019s List.\nTime for a brief digression: I have\nrarely in my life understood how \u2018critics\u2019 extrapolate such a wealth of meaning and information from a picture,\nor a shitty bed or any art. I don\u2019t believe in extrapolating works because\n(to quote Oscar Wilde) \u2018To reveal art\nand conceal the artist is art\u2019s aim.\u2019 Any\ninterpretation of art is a reflection of\nthe observer, not the artist. What is\ninteresting is that graphic novels are\na reflection of society at the time each\nnovel is written. The novels that sell\nwell are a truer reflection of the market\u2019s mood at the time, thus the whole\nmarket adjusts to be more sellable;\nover a long time this reveals how a\nsociety\u2019s mood has changed. This was\nprobably more accurate in the heyday\nof comics, but is still equally valid even\nin the smaller market today. I hope you\nenjoy this idea as much as I do, as it is\ntruly unique in the art world.\nBack on course! Frank Miller is probably best known for his work on the Sin\nCity series, which addresses as many of\nsociety\u2019s ills as Dante\u2019s Inferno does,\nbut also for his work on Batman: Year\nOne, which paints a picture of a flawed\nhero as well as Dostoyevsky (the guy\nwho wrote Crime and Punishment)\nhimself could. You are probably more\nlikely to have heard of his recent film\nsuccesses 300 and the Sin City film,\n(also Robocop, if you are interested!)\nhowever you should definitely make\nthe time to look up some of the graphic\nnovels.

I\u2019ll just admit it, I like\nBeyonce. There I said it. Anyway,\nlet\u2019s move on. Radiohead have\nreturned to the top spot. How\nexciting...\n-Kadhim Shubber\nFor our readers who may not have\nheard of Vivian Girls, can you describe the kind of music you play?\nWe\u2019re a three piece that plays punk\nrock that is also heavily inspired by girl\ngroups of the 60s and the Wipers.\nThe Wipers?\nThey\u2019re an American band from Portland I think, they\u2019re awesome.\nIs it difficult for an all-girl band not\nto be stereotyped? With a sort of\n\u201cgirl power\u201d label for example?\nWe do get labelled as a Riot Grrl band,\nwhich we don\u2019t identify with because\nour music isn\u2019t very political, but there\nare definitely disadvantages to being\nin an all female band because people want to stick that label on you as\nthough that identifies you. People try\nto group you together with other girl\nbands even though we don\u2019t necessarily sound similar, it\u2019s just based on the\nfact there\u2019s women in the band.\nThat\u2019s weird you get called Riot Grrl\nbecause I haven\u2019t really heard of any\nbands describing themselves as Riot\nGrrl since the early 90s. You don\u2019t\nhave an image like other female artists that focuses on being sexy, or\nshocking like Peaches or weird and\nfashion-y like say, Fan Death...\nYeah we don\u2019t really have an image that\nfits into those catagories. I do love Riot\nGrrl though, my first tattoo was a Bikini Kill tattoo.\nI used to love Bikini Kill! Do you\nwish you were around at that time?\nI feel that your music is almost nostalgic for the indie rock and punk of\nthe 90s.\nThanks! We\u2019re all really into a lot of\nstuff from the 90s.\nYour latest album, Everything Goes\nWrong, sounds a lot heavier and\nmore stripped back than your first.\nWould you say this is a deliberate\nreaction to the kind of lo-fi dreamy\nindie that is popular at the moment?\nI think at that time we wanted to make\na more punk record, and we did that\nwith Everything Goes Wrong. It\u2019s not\nnecessarily the sound we\u2019re going to\ncontinue with on future albums. But\nwe\u2019re proud of it and the sound is just\nwhat we felt we had to do at that time.\nAre you going to take a different direction in the future?\nYeah we\u2019re taking a more vocal heavy\napproach. We\u2019ve been listening to a lot\nof music by these two sisters that are\n10 and 12 from the 1950s. They\u2019re super innocent and they have these really\ncute voices and at times they sound\nkind of ghostly because of the recording aesthetic. We\u2019re kind of going for\nthat. A more spectre-esque sound.\nWe\u2019ve also been really into Neil Young\n& Crazy Horse.\nI think Everything Goes Wrong reminds me of bands like Beat Happening, is that sort of music an\ninfluence?\nYeah we\u2019re all big fans of Beat Happening but they\u2019re probably not really a\nconscious influence.\nDo you think that the growing popularity of electronic music has changed\nthe scene for punk and indie bands?\nI don\u2019t know. I think that it\u2019s to do with\ntechnology. I think that a lot of the\nbands that are like labelled as lo-fi are\nkind of an answer to all the electronic\nmusic and the high quality production\nthat we have now. There is a deliberate\nreturn to old techniques.\nWhat about shoegaze and the \u201cshoegaze revival\u201d? It\u2019s getting way more\npopular again, at least in the UK\nanyway.\nI don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t really have much\nof that in America I think it\u2019s more of a\nBritish thing.\nYou\u2019ve played a lot of shows on this\nside of the pond, do you think you\nget a different reception here to your\nnative New York?\nYeah, well before this tour I would say\nthey\u2019re much the same but on this tour\nwe\u2019ve become way more popular in the\nUK. Our recent shows in the UK have\nhad the best turn out we\u2019ve ever had.\nThat\u2019s surprising because you play a\nvery American style of music.\nYeah it\u2019s weird, maybe because in New\nYork so many bands are constantly\ntouring through there, so there\u2019s more\nchoice.\nHey, we get a lot of bands touring\nthrough London!\nYeah ha, I guess you do. I guess we\ndon\u2019t know why we\u2019re so popular here.\nAre there any UK bands you\u2019ve been\nenjoying at the moment?\nYeah, Male Bonding are good friends\nof ours, they\u2019re really good. Veronica\nFalls who we are playing with tonight\nare really good. We\u2019re playing with\nWet Dog in the U.S.\nCan you tell me a secret about Vivian Girls that\u2019s never been printed\nbefore?\nUmm.... that\u2019s hard! Ummm.. I don\u2019t\nknow - I can\u2019t think of one!\nThere must be something, some tour\nanecdotes or something like that.\nWe are so boring! We don\u2019t do any-thing. Every night people ask us to\nhang out and party but we just like to\ngo home and go online. Our idea of a\nparty is just sitting in our hotel room\non the internet.\nHahaha, I guess that counts.\nOn crazy nights we watch There\u2019s\nSomething About Mary and listen to\nDavid Lee Roth, oh what\u2019s that song, a\nVan Halen song... I dunno. I\u2019m a huge\nTaylor Swift fan, maybe that\u2019s a secret.\nWho\u2019s Taylor Swift?\nShe\u2019s like a singer-songwriter girl who\ngets labelled as country in the U.S.,\nkind of like Miley Cyrus. We like Lady\nGaga too. You have to respect how\nhard she works, and she writes all her\nown lyrics and creates her own image\nherself.\nDo you think Vivian Girls would ever\ngo for a crazy outfits Lady Gaga type\nimage?\nNo! We all really like to wear pants!\nVivian Girls like wearing pants, what a shock...\nAlexandra Ashford interviews Ali Koehler before their sell out gig at Hoxton Bar & Grill\nAli Koehler is the lady in green. I wonder what other tattoos they have...\nWant to go skiing and listen to De La Soul?\nKadhim Shubber does but unfortunately he has exams straight\nafter Easter. No Snowbombing for him then...\nOLLY HEARSEY\nS\nnowbombing Festival might\nnot be the most convenient\nfestival that you go to this year;\nbeing held in the Austrian Alps\nand all. It also might not be the cheapest festival that you go to this year, considering that you have to get to Austria and also find somewhere to stay.\nBut with the possiblitiy of a road trip,\nbands like De La Soul, Wild Beasts and\nCrookers and the fact that it\u2019s basically\na snow festival, it may well the most\nfun festival that you go to this year.\nThe festival definitely has a dj driven\nlineup, with acts Fatboy Slim, Scratch\nPerverts and 2manydjs along side Subfocus so this festival might not be for\nfinancially challenged X-Factor lovers.\nBut if you\u2019ve got some student loan\nlying around and you\u2019ve got no time\nfor festivals this summer, grab your skis\nand head out to Snowbombing festival.\nwww.snowbombing.com That\u2019s it.

Although we planned to leave\nthe Union at 6pm, we were slightly\nlate, maybe because when I, and later\nAlex, went down to the store, we found\nJim, James and Joe reminiscing about\ntheir recent clean-out of the store (the\nbread-tree and banana gloop featured\nstrongly!) and comparing favourite\ntypes of biscuit.\nThe good banter continued as the\ntwo packed minibuses set off on the\nwet Friday night. There were some\nbanging tunes to be had on the radio and horror stories of high school\nhouse parties kept us all entertained.\nUnfortunately, disaster struck on the\nM1 when we were signalled by other\ndrivers and realised the tarpaulin had\nblown off the roof of the minibus! After a minor panic, we pulled over and\nall the bags were pulled to safety inside the minibus. They were wet but\nluckily nothing fell off. We don\u2019t know\nyet what became of the tarpaulin but\nthere hasn\u2019t been anything on the news\nconcerning coach-loads of nuns or orphans crashing and burning, so hopefully no harm was done!\nRafal, Jules, Joe and James did a sterling job driving us to Wales and we arrived at St Mary\u2019s hut about 1am. Although there were lots of us, it was a\nfreezing night \u2013 our breath hung in the\nair inside the hut!\nWe woke up at 7am to the smell of\nporridge with fruit and nuts (we reckon scavenged by Jim\u2019s forest friends!).\nWe soon set off for our first day of\nwalking. We climbed Carnedd Dafydd\nand Carnedd Llewelyn, splitting into\ntwo groups and crossing paths half-way. The two peaks are connected by\na ridge which made quite easy walking\nalong the top. However, walking on\nthe steep slopes was generally made\nquite tricky because there was snow\nand it was quite slippery in places.\nThe snow at the top was really nice\nand deep though (right up past your\nknees) so we enjoyed messing about\nand sledging down sections of the path\non our bums! The views were really\nfantastic \u2013 the sun was low but bright\n\u2013 and you could see for miles at times.\nWe passed a frozen lake and found frozen holes in the snow which James hid\nin. We also had a giggle at Angie\u2019s German chocolate, which was advertised\non the packaging as being \u201cQuadratisch. Praktisch. Gut.\u201d (\u201cSquare. Practical. Good.\u201d) \u2013 classic!\nDinner on the Saturday night was\na bit of an extravaganza. As our boots\nsteamed by the fire (thankfully warming up the sleeping quarters in the\nprocess), Jim served up his Masterpiece concoction \u2013 Spaghetti Carbonara. Big success. For some of us, our\nlast memory of this dish was the acidic\nout-of-a-jar mess that Jim served up on\nthe Easter tour in Scotland (no offence\nJim!). He cooked the equivalent of half\na jar each but it was so bad that even\nJim couldn\u2019t finish his fifth portion (al-though when the remainder congealed\novernight, he did use it as sandwich\nfiller the next day). Luckily, his home\nrecipe version went down much better\nand lots of us went back for seconds\nand thirds. Pudding was really yum too\n\u2013 cake in the most sugary fudge sauce\never. The evening was spiced up by the\n\u2018Hangover\u2019 may be different in every language, but it feels just the same\ndiscovery of a bottle of vodka in which\nchillis and garlic had been stuffed (and\nwere now pickling) that had been left in\nthe hut by a previous society. Obviously,\na manhood competition followed, along\nwith lots of streaming eyes!\nThe Sunday breakfast was not quite\na tempting as the first \u2013 everything\nsmelt of burnt porridge and the yesterday\u2019s porridge had actually set into one\nbig lump. Thea suggested taking it up\nthe mountain, burying it in the snow\nand making porridge ice lollies! After\ntidying up the hut we set off for Snowdon and started off as one big group.\nWe passed some beautiful waterfalls\nand could see the effects of mining and\nlandslips in the area (cue brief geology\nof Snowdonia lesson!). The group soon\nsplit, with the intention of approaching\nthe summit from opposite sides, but as\nwe climbed our side of the valley we\ncould see the other group had taken\nthe wrong route, meaning they had to\nscramble up the steep valley side instead of a longer, gentler ascent. Truth\nbe told, we had quite a giggle at their\nexpense (sorry guys!).\nWe soon hit snow and at the top of\nthe ridge we could see the whole valley we had just climbed (with the cloud\nlevel dipping down below our height)\nand also over into the next horseshoe\nvalley. It was a brilliant sight in the\nsnow. It had been quite hard work\nthough, and biscuits (Rich Tea) were\nhanded around. They were so dry\nthey sucked every bit of moisture out\nof your mouth, so a bit of crazy Camel\nBak action followed! The walk became\nvery tough from there to the summit \u2013\nthe wind was damn cold, and though\nthe snow helped with footing in some\nrespects, it was still easy to slip.\nOnce we reached the summit we\ncouldn\u2019t see anything but greyness,\nand the wind was strong. Randomly, a\nseagull came and joined us in the snow\n(good camouflage tactic) \u2013 probably\nafter some lunch. We passed the other\nhalf of the group as we started back\ndown and had a brief chat.\nThe way down was pleasant but a\nbit dodgy in places \u2013 I was a Dumbo\nat one point and tripped over my own\nfeet, falling off the path and quite a way\ndown the mountain side, which gave\nAngie a fright! Luckily there were no\ncliffs! Paula also had a bit of a tumble\nlater on but fortunately no-one was\nhurt. We got back to the minibuses\nin good time, but the other group had\ntaken a different route to what was\nplanned so ended up being a bit later.\nThe journey home went smoothly\nthough and we arrived back to a wet\nLondon about 11pm. An excellent start\nto the New Year!\n\u2018WTF?!\u2019 says Caroline Bailey, and finds that in the Imperial dictionary, there is no entry for \u2018Fear\u2019\nInternational Food Night as it should be, with Ed Richards\nO\nn Thursday 21st January, the culinary scene of\nGreat Britain was shaken to its very founda-tions. Gordon Ramsay\u2019s\npants suddenly became fuller of skids\nthan your drive would be if you invited\nJeremy Clarkson for dinner. The head\nchef at Nobu fell on his sword. Heston\nBlumenthal admitted that the inspiration for snail porridge came from\nthe time when he regurgitated equine\nejaculate.\nYes, yes, the rumours are true; Erasmus Society\u2019s International Food Night\n(IFN) had arrived. Over 150 students\nand staff ascended the red carpet to\nthe Level 8 Common Room, Blackett\nLaboratory, for a night of haute cuisine\nand fine wine accompanied by a musical backdrop of Rammstein, followed\nby a morning of nausea, gastroenteritis\nand temporary blindness.\nThe French made Crepes (pancakes),\nthe Norwegians made Lapper (pan-cakes) and the Spanish made Tortilla\n(pancakes). Kudos to the lady who\nmade a curry and to the Swiss guy who\nmade Raclette for making the cuisine\na little more varied. Also many thanks\nto the two strapping ladies who let me\ntaste their balls. The creamy filling was\nnot only delicious but also proved to be\nvery effective at moisturising my face.\nThe event provided an opportunity\nfor current Imperial students considering a year abroad to meet some of their\nEuropean neighbours and discuss life\nat their universities. In addition Imperialists were able to brush up their\nforeign language skills, learning new\nwords such as: daylight, weekend, so-cialising, pudenda etc.\nThere was a fully stocked bar serving the finest wine from France, Spain,\nItaly, Germany, California and some\nplum brandy made in a basement in\nSerbia and smuggled illegally through\ncustoms. We are very thankful to Adrian Hawksworth for providing all of the\nwine and definitely not drinking all\nof the brandy. Also thanks to the language department for helping to publicise the event. This article will make\nno mention of any personal grievances\nI may have due to my poor mark in my\nsecond year language option. These\nwill be dealt with in person, bastardos!!\nUpcoming events include a pub and\nclub night next week, trips to Stratford-upon-Avon and Manchester/Liverpool and Valentine\u2019s Speed Dating.\nA bient\u00f4t.\n\n"

Great news\nThe top five snacks to complement your chosen wine, enjoy!\nHolly Cumbers thought you might like a list of the snacks that will really help your wine to taste heavenly\nT\no go with the absolutely\ngorgeous wine, here are a\nlist of the top 5 snacks to\nenjoy with wine. The top\nspot has to go to olives,\nnot to everyone\u2019s choosing, but I personally adore olives especially with a\nnice glass of white wine.\nThere are so many different varie-ties- of which I am not going to list, as I\nam sure you all have your personal fa-vourites. However, if you are looking to\ntry a new olive I would suggest organic\nraw olives. These are left to ripen and\ntherefore don\u2019t have the bitter flavour.\nI would advise buying these olives online as they can be extremely difficult to\nfind in high street shops.\nNumber deux has to be cheese and\nbiscuits. I can\u2019t get enough of blue\ncheeses, I have recently fallen in love\nwith roquefort- it tastes amazing with a\nstrong red wine. However, blue cheese\nis one of those things you\u2019ll either love\nor hate. It definitely takes an aquired\nIf you are looking for a healthier\nsnack try a bit of veg (trying adding\ndips to make it a bit more exciting).\nRaw vegetables, such as celery and\ncarrot, go particularly well with white\nwine. They always go down well at\nparties and are super easy to prepare!\nThe next snack on the list is ideal\nfor a student party (you can even get\nit from the take-away) and you\u2019ve got\nto love it! From years of experience I\nhave found that most pizzas go well\nwith wine. However, I tend to opt for\nthe tradition al cheese and tomato.\nThe ideal wines to go with pizza are\neither chardonnay or zinfandel.\nThe easiest snack to prepare, and\nthe one that I find is always popular,\nis potato crisps (I would suggest kettle\nchips- again slightly more expensive\nbut well worth it!). Personally I prefer\nplain crisps, I have never fancied trying salt and vinegar crisps with wine,\nI feel it would slightly spoil the wine!\nCall me fussy, but I do like my wine.\ntaste (and nobody can deny no matter how much of a fan you are that it\nsmells extremely strong- pretty similar\nto rotten socks!).\nIf you aren\u2019t into your blue cheeses\nthen there are plenty of other cheeses\nthat go well with wine. I find that fruity\ncheeses such as white Stilton with\napricots or Wensleydale with cranberries go well with all kinds of wine.\nAlthough saying that, if you\u2019re looking\nto enjoy a glass of red wine, I would\npersonally suggest Brie or Camembert\n(however don\u2019t go for the Sainsbury\u2019s\nbasics!). They go particularly well with\na red wine from the southern French\nregions.\nIf you prefer white wines i would\nsuggest a lighter cheese. I simply love\nGruy\u00e8re (it is slightly more expensive\nthan other cheeses but well worth it), it\nhas a slightly sweet and smooth taste.\nBut, be careful when choosing a cheese\nas a too strong a flavour can spoil the\ntaste of the wine.\nH\nigh street wine shops\nhave not been doing so\nwell of late. Threshers (also branded\nas Wine Rack)\nrecently announced that it has\ngone into administration. Unless it\nfinds a buyer, we could be left with\nOddbins as the only major chain on\nthe High Street, with Majestic picking\nup the bulk buy customers.\nThe challenge to the high street\nhas been from the supermarkets.\nIn terms of cheap, Asda and Tesco present a huge range of bottles\npriced below \u00a34, many of which are\nnot terrible. At the higher end, Waitrose, with its battalion of Masters\nof Wine buying the stock, puts out a\nlarge range of consistent, interesting\nand great value stuff; equally M&S\nhas been keeping its end up of late.\nSo Oddbins has quite a high bar to\nreach, in terms of quality and value.\nWhich is why I can\u2019t understand\nits pricing policy. You get a 20% discount if you buy a mixed case of 12.\nNothing wrong with that, you might\nthink, but the thing is that 20% is actually a lot. It makes a bottle that is\n\u00a36.99 on the shelves cost \u00a35.59 in a\ncase. That is a spread over two very\ndifferent \u2018price points\u2019: that of the \u2018I\nwant to try something a bit more interesting with my dinner, tonight\u2019 and\n\u2018I\u2019m looking for something for about\na fiver to take to a party\u2019. There\u2019s a\ncorrespondingly large discrepancy\nin your expectations. The upshot of\nthis discrepancy is that Oddbins can\nseem expensive, which seems like the\nlast\nthing\nit needs\nright\nnow.\nGiven\nthat, this\nis how I\nsuggest\nyou \u2018do\u2019\nOddbins.\nEither pop\nin and pick\nup a bottle\nor two of\ntheir \u00a33.79 offerings from Italy (which\ndo not attract the 20%\ncase discount) OR make\npeace with the fact you\nand a few mates are going\nto get through 12 bottles\nbetween you and buy a case.\nThe latter is a great idea\nfor a party or a Christmas dinner anyway. If you do decide to buy a\ncase, either trust to my recommendations (or those of the guy in the shop,\nof course), or swallow the by-the-bottle price while you decide how to\nbuild up your case.\nFizz\nCondesa Blanca Brut NV, Spain, 12%,\n\u00a35.19/\u00a36.49\nSo delicate it\u2019s almost non-existent, but\nretaining enough acidity that it\u2019s a good\nvalue decent fizzy (went down a storm\nat the Maths post-grad party).\nRed\nRosso de Sicilia, Pasqua, 2007 Sicily,\nItaly, 12%, \u00a33.79\nIt\u2019s actually okay and I prefer it to the\nhousewhite.Verylight,butit\u2019sdrywitha\npleasant hint of bitterness to add depth.\nRocca Maura Vin de Pays du Gard,\n2007, Rhone, France, 14.5%,\n\u00a34.79/\u00a35.99\n2007 has been declared a great vintage\nfor the Rhone. Even at the lower end,\nthis lives up to the hype. Very complex\nblend of five different grape varieties,\nvery fragrant with good depth. The opulent syrah grape shines through.\nLa Multa Old Vine Garnacha, 2007,\nCalatayud, Spain, 14.5% \u00a35.59/\u00a36.99\nQuite tannic actually. Some nice deep\nfruit rounded off with quite a bit of oak.\nSo fat and fruity, it\u2019s difficult to see anyone disliking this.\nThe following wines were all tasted at the Oddbins Press tasting on 03/11/09. Prices as [bottle price]/[case price]\nNegroamaro, Vini Del Sole, 2008,\nPuglia, Italy, 13.5% \u00a36.39/\u00a37.99\nI always seem to like this grape. This has a\ngood sweet plummy depth. A gulp of tasty\nItalian sunshine.\nLobster Reef Pinot Noir, 2008 Marlborough, New Zealand, 13.5% \u00a37.99/\u00a39.99\nLove this. I think pinot works best with\na little savouriness and this has a sort of\ntomato/pomegranate action happening\nwhich stops it from tasting like a cartoon.\nChorey-Les-Beaunes Domaine\nCornu, 2006, Burgundy, France, 13%\n\u00a315.99/\u00a319.99\nExpensive, but that\u2019s what I call a Red\nBurgundy. A good tannic chew with massive violet florality. (My tasting note reads\n\u2018That\u2019s the F-ing S-, Might even buy some\nof that.\u2019)\nSweet\nCh\u00e2teau Filhot Sauternes, 1999, Bordeaux, France, 14%, \u00a313.59/\u00a316.99\nYou might think it\u2019s mad to say this is good\nvalue, but it is ten years old with much\nlonger left in it. Raisiny buttery brioche\nnotes combine with that plasticky twang\nof botrytis to give you a mouthful which is\ntotal opulence.\nWhite\nBianco di Puglia, Pasqua 2008,\nPuglia Italy, 12% \u00a33.79\nComes across somewhere between\nan average Soave and a Pinot Grigio.\nWaxy. Just about drinkable.\nStratum Sauvignon Blanc 2008,\nMarlborough New Zealand 13%,\n\u00a35.59/\u00a36.99\nThis is entirely typical of the style: it\nstinks of passionfruit and elderflower\nwith a big tangy grip. Not necessarily\nmy favourite style but\nthis is a very good\nexample . Definitely\nworth the extra on\nthe house white.\nBourgogne Chardonnay EtienneSauzet, 2007,\nBurgundy, France,\n\u00a315.99/\u00a319.99\nWhite burgundy isn\u2019t\nwhite burgundy without oak,\nand this stands out for having a decent amount without\nbeing overbearing. This has a\nnice angelica/jelly tots nose\nto it. Good stuff, but it is\nexpensive!\nDavid Stewart has the word... and the word is wine. From the vineyards of France, Spain, Italy and New\nZealand, to the cases of our loveable Oddbins, get the word on the wines just a walk away.\nSome real corkers from Oddbins...\nCheese, cheese and more cheese...

Conveniently, the bus halted and, grandiose\nwith the announcement, mother and\ndaughter uttered their goodbyes and exited the stage.\nFloodgates containing her suppressed\nembarrassment and crude rage unleashed the bile that was the all-too-fa-miliar mother-to-son grilling. Poor kid,\nat the brink of bursting his own floodgate\nof tears, murmured apologetically and\nsheepishly followed so they disembarked,\nhis head lowered as the mother took her\nunextinguished vengeance to the streets.\nPity, may there be, to our younger\ngeneration.\n*\nThe equivalent of this anecdote-telling\ntaking place in a pub would be the wonderful form of bullshitting. There were\nno such grillings happening on the no.22\nbus bound for Putney Common; nor was\nthe son\u2019s anguish over the mother\u2019s fury\nand disappointment an actual source of\ndistraction. Theconversationwasneutral\nrather than hostile, the young prodigy\u2019s\necstacy genuine rather than rehearsed.\nIn short, the conflict was the fabrication of a storyteller seeking to entice his\naudience into, well, being his audience,\nby smearing the mundane content with\nhoney-trickling bits of suspense, con-tempt, and artificial flamboyance worthy\nof a best-selling commercial fiction.\nSo I basically conned you into reading\nmy editorial, I guess.\nBut, at least my depictions weren\u2019t so\nexaggerated that, fictionally speaking,\nhad the mother clasping her spidery fingers around the son\u2019s neck and squeezed\nlife out of the oesophagus, or the daughter casting condescending looks at the\nboy as she gleamed in vanity.\nIt is a temptation, regarding travel writ-ing, to elaborate one\u2019s experiences and\nthe messages and morals one wishes to\nconvey by fabricating a few harmless lies.\nBut, when travel writing retains its readership through their blind faith in travel\nwriters\u2019 honesty, surely \u2018betrayal\u2019 be more\nappropriate a word to describe the act of\nconcoction?\nA recent article in the Guardian by\nJohn Hooper decribes how this \u2018creative\u2019\ntravel writing had existed for centuries\nbefore our time.\n\u201cIntroducing \u2018colour\u2019, altering the sequence of events to make a book or article \u2018flow\u2019, exaggeration, invention and\ndownright lying all have a history in the\nchronicling of travel that goes back at\nleast as far as the ancient mariners who\ntold stories of sirens and sea monsters.\u201d\nStefano Malatesta, an award-winning\nItalian author, goes further:\n\u201cThe lie is intrinsic to travel books. And\nas ignorance of the world gradually di-minishes, the difficulty of recounting it\nin books increases.\u201d\nYet unlike its 17th\ncentury counter-parts, the main service travel writing\nin the modern world is not of temporal\nescapades from reality, but of sources of\nfacts and figures possibly for the benefit\nof someone preparing to revisit the voyages of his storyteller.\nI must also disagree with Malatesta\u2019s\nsentiment that the quality of travel writing must decline solely because of the\nresourcefulness we possess. Fundamentally, what sets apart good and bad travelling writing is that, while the latter fails\nto address anything beyond physical\nmanifestations, an outstanding writer\nwould capture the essence of a location,\nprocess and express such as it captivates\nthe human mind into springing insights,\nspiritual enlightenments and the likes. It\nis an understanding of the world, unique\nin its own right, untampered and unfazed\nby the urge to appeal through dishonesty.\nUpon these grounds I shall continue to\nwrite and deliver to you what I perceive\nas deliverable. In the meantime, slap me\non the wrist for my betrayal, if you must.\n\u2018Personality Contests\u2019 for Travel Internships\nDomestic Tourism\nRed Hot Chilli Destinations\nTravel &\nSocial Media\nFrom the \u2018Best Job in the World\u2019 phenomenon that conquered our hearts in 2009\nsprung the waves of travel-related givea-ways, with which came the contenders\nand the rigorous selection processes that\nexamine their entries to the core.\nEvenfromthetopofmy headcanIyield\nseveral examples of contests so seemingly novelty and seductive that they can\neven make the most dirt-hating glamour\ngirl screech and faint in excitement.\nThe World Traveller Internship, hosted\nby STA Travel, offers two survivors of\nintricate competition the opportunity to\ntraveltheworld\u2013allthewhiledocumenting their journeys through blogging and\nvideo-making \u2013 entirely at the expenses\nof the travel agency. See WorldTravellerIntern.co.uk for more details.\nAs part of a media campaign, the lucky\n(though well-deserved) winner of California Calling receives free tickets to Los\nAngeles, VIP club entries and US$1000\nspending money. The catch? Film your\nexperiences \u2013 is that too much to ask? See\nfor yourself at CaliforniaCalling.co.uk.\nThis might not sound, the very least, attractive to us Brits but hey, if the Aussies\ncan begin exploring the red gravel in their\nbackyards and call it holiday-making, I\u2019m\nsure you can take your break to somewhere a tad closer to home.\nRide the surfs in Devon; re-live the Roman times in Bath; stalk and hunt down\nyour own venison in Scottish pastures;\ndiscover Snowdon with your own feet.\nDoubt me upon my statement that the\npossibilities are endless and you may no\nlonger address yourself as a patriot.\nAs I mentioned a couple of weeks ago\nthe sheer extent of this modern love\naffair between travel and social media\nis enough to woo conservative adventurers into taking blogging and twitter lessons. Equipping travellers with\ninfo. on local know-hows, shortening the distances between home and\nabroad, acknowledge its potential and\nwatch it flourish in the new decade.\nIt was shocking to find so many destinations previously perceived as\nhostile to visitors opening their doors\nto the tourism market. The more\nevident still when, a stroll and many\nbilos of kava at the Adventure Travel\nLive event later, I had stumbled across\nenough names of those countries to\nfeel spontaneously fervent with desire\nto visit whilst terrorised by my mere\nexpression of interest and lurid details\nof the, well, morbid stuff that might\nhappen. For instance, this is what one\ncompany was advertising:\nBlimey. Though it isn\u2019t the only one.\nCountries recently liberated from (or\ninching towards the end of) conflict\n\u2013 such as Sri Lanka and the end of its\nstruggle against the Tamil Tigers \u2013\nare expected to rapidly gain popularity in the tourism market.\nLatin America is set to reign supreme in 2010 as a tourism destina-tion, yet India and China have peeled\noff their aloof demeanour and tightened their reins as they present themselves as serious competition.\nAnd as we, as tourists, become increasingly brave and daring, even the\nharsh conditions and gritty environment\naren\u2019t deterring us from invading with\nour rucksacks.\nTripAdvisor.com has identified the following places as the top five destinations\nfor 2010:\nTroncones, Mexico\nNairn, Scotland\nEl Chalten, Patagonia\nPatara, Turkey\nRothenburg ob der Tauber,\nGermany\nIn light of the recent revival of ter-rorism, Yemen is now amongst those\ncountries deemed unsafe for travelling.\nFor my review of Adventure Travel\nLive visit TheTravellingEditor.com.\nWe need a new travel editor!\nHave you travelled?

One World Week\naims to encourage equality relating to\ngender, sexual orientation, race, religion and disability.\nImperial College Union has put on\nvarious different events around campus this week, with each day having a\nspecific theme. Monday\u2019s theme was\nGender Equality, and so we had a silent\ndocumentary, which tackled sexism in\nthe lab.\nThe documentary was produced by\nWomen in Science, Engineering and\nTechnology, a student-run society at\nImperial for female students, and the\nshort film was broadcast all around\ncampus. There was also \u2018Interfaith\nInteractive\u2019 held on Monday lunch-time, hosted by the Chaplaincy. The\naim of this event, held in the JCR, was\nfor people to find out about different\nfaiths and religion at Imperial.\nOn Tuesday we had a Sexual Orientation themed day, with help from IQ,\nImperial\u2019s LGBT society. There was a\nscreening of \u2018Milk\u2019, a recent film starring Sean Penn, which details the life\nof Harvey Milk, a politician and gay\nrights campaigner during the 70s.\nThere was also a couple of \u2018One World\nWeek\u2019 themed rounds in the Union\nPub Quiz on Tuesday night, which,\nnaturally, the IQ team won.\nThe theme on Wednesday was ReliCharlotte Morris\nCharlotte Morris\ngion and Belief, with a Religion and\nScience Question Time: a 2 hour\ndiscussion of science and religion,\nwhere they conflict or compliment\neach other. This was similar to an\nevent held by the Christian Union\nlast week in their \u2018Free Thinking\nWeek\u2019. Only this time, we had representatives from different religions\nincluding Hindu, Muslim, Baha\u2019i,\nChristian and Humanist.\nThursday lunchtime saw a film\nscreening of A Beautiful Mind to fit in\nwith the day\u2019s theme of Disability. The\nfilm, starring Russell Crow, follows the\nlife of John Nash Jr., an exceptional\nmathematician who develops paranoid\nschizophrenia .\nThe One World Week finale is International Night, an evening of entertainment in the Great Hall. The\nperformance includes input from various international societies, along with\nCapoeira society (an Afro-Brazillian\nart form which combines elements of\nmartial arts, music and dance), and\nBelly Dancing Society. International\nNight aims to celecbrate the diversity\nof race and culture that we have here at\nImperial, and with the tickets costing\n\u00a35, they also managed to raise some\nmoney for the Haiti appeal.\nImperial\u2019s first One World Week can\nbe considered to be a success, with\nsome very thought-provoking issues\nbeing raised and tackled.\nIt is an event that many people have\nexpressed their hope to see return in the next academic\nyear.\nMorphy Day: Looking back\nat Imperial\u2019s sporting\nI\ntalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s plans to recruit showgirls,\nmodels, and television stars, most\nof whom have little political experi-ence, to run for office as People of\nLiberty party candidates.\nThe arrangement was reported to have\nbeen revived on Monday following his recent resurgence in popularity. The original\nplan, which was first scheduled for elections\nlast June, was fraught with controversy. Also\non Monday, in a speech in Jerusalem, Berlusconi stated that, \u201cmy greatest desire, as long\nas I am a protagonist in politics, is to bring\nIsrael into membership of the European Union.\u201d Israel has not requested\nsuch considerations; moreover, economists and diplomats are questioning\nthe feasibility of such discussions given the fact that Italy is Iran\u2019s largest\nEuropean trading partner.\nThe world beyond\nCollege walls\nBy Raphael Houdmont & Tom Greany\nA\nhigh ranking North Korean finance official has recently \u2018disappeared from view\u2019\n, according to South Korean intelligence,\nas the disastrous consequences of the communist country\u2019s\nfailed monetary reforms accumulate.\nPak Nam-Ki, the Communist Party\u2019s director for planning and finance,\nhas reportedly been absent from public activities since early January. On 30\nNovember 2009, a decree was issued announcing old North Korean banknotes would be swapped for new ones at a rate of 100 to one. But the\namount of currency people were allowed to exchange was restricted to\n100,000 old won (no more than $30, barely enough to buy a 50kg sack of\nrice). Any cash held above that would be worthless - effectively wiping out\npeople\u2019s savings.\nMany reacted with anger and panic, and the changes are reported to have\nwrought havoc to distribution networks and sparked chaos in shops and\nmarkets. Organizations with contacts in the North said some people had\nattacked security agents patrolling markets. The moves also led to spiraling\ninflation.\nNorth Korea\nA\nfghan President Hamid Karzai, under increasing political\npressure, has attempted to assure his constituency over the\nfuture of their country and economy.\nKarzai attempted to lift the spirits of his people by announcing some of the results of an unfinished USGS survey\nof Afghanistan\u2019s mineral deposits. He claimed that the total value of Afghanistan\u2019s reserves near 1 trillion USD. In order for the country to extract\nthese resources however, quite a lot of infrastructure will need be built and\npurchased: thirty years of war and mismanagement have left such infrastructure decrepit or nonexistent. Increasing revenues from mining could\nhelp to boost the economy, decrease the country\u2019s dependence on the export of opium, and pacify the country.\nMeanwhile, attacks on NATO forces in the country are continuing despite the harsh winter conditions in the country. Two US soldiers have\nbeen killed in a bomb attack in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday, a\nNATO statement said.\nAfghanistan\nItaly\nFelix, Beit Quad P\nFax 0\nL\nb\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 05 FEBRUARY 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nApple iPad - meet the competition\nN\now that Apple has gotten\nthe whole iPad announcement out the way and the\ndevice is out in the hands\nof certain celebrities, it\u2019s not going to\nbe long before you start seeing them\neverywhere. Like iPhones before them,\nyou might even see the odd one riding the tube, taking the bus or being\nmugged out of tourists hands as they\nuse them for maps out and about in the\nstreets of our capital. Yet, if you\u2019re like\nme and don\u2019t fancy spending somewhere between \u00a3400 and \u00a3650 on yet\nanother heavily-restricted Apple prod-uct, what are the alternatives? Though\ntablet devices have been around for\nages, 2010 is set to see an explosion in\ntheir numbers. Electronics manufacturers worldwide, from the unknown\nto the well-known, are lining up to\ntry and grab market share in what is\nwidely seen as the next big market. So\nhere at felix we thought we\u2019d give you\na quick and dirty run-down of some of\nthe most promising alternatives to the\niPad.\nFeroz Salam takes a look at some contenders the Apple iPad is going up against in the new tablet segment\nOne of the major announcements out of CES was the Slate, produced by the now\nsecond biggest electronics manufacturer HP and running Windows 7. For your\naverage user, the combination will probably provide a familiar interface albeit not\nas touch-friendly at a much lower price than Apple\u2019s, and could quite possibly be\nthe biggest competitor to the iPad. With all the trimmings of a full OS including\nmultitasking, a camera, Adobe Flash, a faster processor and no limitation on the\nprograms that you are allowed to install on it, there\u2019s no question that you\u2019re getting more computer and less iPod touch in your device. The flipside of the many\nextra features, however, is the slightly chunkier body - the Slate is definitely one\nof the less-aesthetically pleasing devices out there. And, of course, with heavier\nspecs comes a heavier price tag which is as yet unannounced, but don\u2019t expect to\nget this power house of a tablet on the cheap.\nThe Android-based Dell Mini 5 (shown left) is a bit of a mystery. It\u2019s gone from\n\u2018under design\u2019 a few weeks ago to \u2018out in a few months\u2019 just a few days back. Yet\nearly specs and a few videos of the device are very promising. Whether the Mini 5\nis a true tablet is questionable - with a 5 inch screen it\u2019s by far the smallest one out\nthere, but it still boasts many features that the iPad doesn\u2019t have like a 5 MP cam-era, multitasking and a USB port for easy connectivity. Yet if you\u2019re looking for a\ntablet to completely replace your netbook (the role that Steve Jobs assigned to the\niPad), the Mini 5 hardly fits the bill. While sleek and handy, it\u2019s only really suited\nfor some light web browsing and a couple of videos on the bus home. Anything\nmore would probably blow your eyes out. So probably best to think of it more as\nan iPod touch competitor rather than the iPod touch XL.\nAnother Android-based device this\ntime from India-based startup Notion\nInk called the Adam, which has been\ngarnering rave reviews from technology blogs. A full tablet-sized display of\n10 inches is backed up by a solid set of\nfeatures including a Tegra chipset and\na neatly finished 14mm body, making\nit the dark horse in a field that\u2019s quickly\nbeing saturated with major technology powerhouses. While the device is\nas versatile as any machine running\nAndroid OS, the manufacturers are\npositioning it as a digital magazine and\nebook reader thanks to some fantastic\nPixel Qi crossover display technology\nand several content publishers recruited for the device. It is set to be fully unveiled at the Mobile World Congress\nlater this year, and only then will we get\nto see whether the promises made by\nthe prototype will be realised in the final device. Rumours are that the Adam\nis going to land around June for about\nUSD 300. One to keep an eye on.\nUnlike the other devices on this list, the Archos 9 is actually available for purchase\nright now. Featuring a 9-inch screen and an Intel Atom processor, the device sells\nat \u00a3450. Unlike the other tablets however, the Archos features a resistive touch\nscreen, meaning that it\u2019s not a multi-touch device (a feature that\u2019s become a consumer favourite) and requires a stylus for fine control input. The device firmly favours functionality, however, delivering 60GB of disk space, 1GB of memory and\na full Windows 7 operating environment. Yet the rather limited 5 hour battery life\non the device isn\u2019t remarkable, being half that of what Apple is promising for the\niPad under full usage. Weighing in at nearly a kilo as well, it\u2019s more a full-fledged\ncomputer than anything else, and it\u2019s pretty hard to see anyone using this device\nfor entertainment on-the-go.\nThe Vega is by far one of the largest tablets on this list, and with a diagonal width\nof 15 inches, matches standard laptop screens. Yet another Android device, the\nVega has all your standard features, plus a magnetic dock that converts the screen\ninto a monitor that can be wired up to a keyboard for a more standard desktop\nexperience. The vast screen real estate comes at price though, with the Vega featuring the poorest battery life of all the tablets - a meagre 4 hours. While watching movies without squinting would be great, there would hardly be time for one\nmovie and some browsing before you would be left with an (undeniably sleek)\nlump of glass and metal. Definitely not one for the long journeys, but with its\ncapability to act as a desktop, it is a worthwhile investment for those who don\u2019t\ndemand performance from their computers and want a tablet around the home.\nPredicted to release later this year, the JooJoo from Singapore-based firm Fusion Garage is an interesting take on the tablet experience that has had a rather\na rocky start to life. The device, formally know as the CrunchPad, keeps in line\nwith the slow shift away from desktop applications and the rise of cloud comput-ing, having solely one focus - the web browser. The tablet boots directly to the\nbrowser window in around 9 seconds, and provides a neat browsing experience\non the sizeable 12-inch screen. Yet whether this device will make it to the market is seriously in doubt. It was supposed to release on the 11th of December,\nbut even today Fusion Garage is only accepting pre-orders for the device. Priced\nat around \u00a3320, it is significantly cheaper than the iPad, but also suffers from a\nmuch smaller feature set. Combined with Apple\u2019s more established reputation as\na manufacturer of consumer electronics, the massive size of the App Store and\nFusion Garage\u2019s legal woes with Michael Arrington, it\u2019s unlikely that the JooJoo is\never going to become a massive consumer hit.\nICD Vega\nNotion Ink\nAdam\nCourtesy of Engadget\u2019s hands on\nHP Slate Archos 9\nDell Mini 5\nFusion Garage JooJoo\n\n"

However, with two fencers carrying injuries, the girls could not afford\nto be overconfident.\nMatches were held by weapon, with\nthe foil on Saturday morning and the\nepee and sabre the next day. The Imperial team, with two foilists, were favoured by this arrangement; Hannah\nBryars, Alice Mitchell and Emily Bottle\nmade short work of their counterparts.\nOxford, Cambridge, Bristol and Queen\nMary\u2019s were no match for the IC girls\nand the women\u2019s team ended the day\nunbeaten in the foil, having established\na comfortable lead.\nAs the girls went on their rampage\nin the second-floor fitness studio of\nEthos, down in the sports hall the men\u2019s\n1st team were having a more mixed\nday. The boys were lacking their two\nbest sabreurs, absent on international\nduty, and although the other weapons\nwere in good shape, the team needed\na strong performance from Cavaillez\nand Joubert, fencing in their inaugural\n1st-team bouts of the season.\nAt stake during the tournament\nweekend were the first and second\nplaces of the southern premiership.\nThese would translate into top-four\nseedings and home turf advantage for\nthe BUCS knockout championships.\nAs of the previous tournament week-end, the men\u2019s team were second, having beaten Oxford and narrowly lost to\nCambridge.\nThe initial match against UCL did\nnot prove to be too challenging as Imperial improved on their score in the\naway match, winning by a large mar-gin, 135-68.\nThe next confrontation, however,\nwas an entirely different ball game (as\nthey say). Starting off against a very\nstrong team, the IC sabreurs could\ndo nothing but limit the damage to a\ntwenty-point loss. Following on from\nthis, the foilists attempted to bridge the\ngap and stand some chance of beating\nOxford. Unfortunately, the match was\nmarred with controversy as the dark\nblues made a mistake in the order of\nbouts and sent on the wrong fencer for\nthe second match. To the best of the\ncaptains\u2019 knowledge, the official sanction for this was immediate forfeiture\nof the match. However, Imperial sport-ingly chose not to apply this; instead\nthe Imperial captain decided to replay\nthe match from where the mistake had\nbeen made. The incident put a definite\ndamper on proceedings and resulted\nin much tension during the rest of the\nIAN BOTTLE\nThree in a row for fencing\n\n"

The Imperial foilists, destabi-lised by the unwelcome pause, failed to\nregain their composure and ended up\nlosing the match by 11 hits. An uphill\nstruggle awaited the epeeists, and they\nrounded off the match with victory by\na single touch which meant that Oxford emerged victorious.\nThe next day saw the women\u2019s team\nfence epee and sabre, while the men\ntook on Bristol and Cambridge.\nBolstered by the previous day\u2019s suc-cess, the girls won all but one of their\nepee matches (with Helen Pennington\nstanding in for the injured Bottle) and\ndominated all of their opponents in the\nsabre.

The match\nstarted with foil, supposedly Bristol\u2019s strongest weapon; the IC foilists\nfenced exceptionally well to win by a\nsingle point, 44-33. The sabre followed\nthis in an equally close match again\nwon by a single hit. Imperial were two\nhits up overall going into the epee and\nseemed on course for the win. However, despite being eight points ahead\nin the final bout, anchor Marcello Colombino\u2019s form collapsed and he left it\nuntil the last possible moment before\nscoring the hit that won the match,\nand scenes of elation erupted in Ethos\nas the men secured second place.

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 05 FEBRUARY 2010\nBUSINESS\nBusiness Editor\nBusiness Editor Sina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian\nbusiness.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIntellectual Property - an oxymoron?\nT\nhe issue of file-sharing\nand intellectual property\nis an interesting one, and\nI wish to discuss it here.\nMany people feel something is wrong with the current system,\nbut disappointingly I have found very\nfew interesting arguments as to why\nthey think something is wrong. I want\nto change that for felix readers today.\nI will first make the philosophical case\nagainst IP, and then look at some practical ways in which the concept hurts\nbusinesses and individuals.\nThe philosophical objection to intellectual property is that it belies the\noriginal concept of property. I have\nno doubt that government-defined\neducation invariably avoids a proper\nexplanation of the concepts of property and ownership, and so I will gladly\nelaborate.\nThe idea of property is to prevent\nconflict over scarcity. In a world of\nscarcity situations arise where two\nor more people want to do different\nthings with the same resource, be it\nan object, piece of land, slice of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum, etc. In\nan uncivilised society, this conflict is\nresolved by who has the biggest club.\nBut when we create the concept of\nownership, and thus unique control,\nover a resource, and people respect\nthose property rights, we foster an environment of security and voluntary\nexchange. These two things allow for\nlong term planning and self-interested\ncooperation and prosperity. This is the\nbasis of the free market.\nThis concept of property is necessary in the case of scarcity, only. If it is\npossible for any or all humans to claim\na resource from an effectively infinite\nsupply, there is no reason to be concerned of potential conflict over scar-city, as everyone can acquire their own.\nIn the same way, up until recently, the\nChairman of IC Libertarian Society Edward Townes explains the philosophical and business case against IP\nWorld Intellectual Property Organisation headquarters inspires innovation\nforced by the attempt to prevent people from voluntary trade and use of\ntheir own resources, as evidenced by\nmany black markets related to intellectual property.\nA second objection is that the existence of intellectual property rights\ngives security to producers so that they\nmay have better incentives to innovate\nand create. This has merit and is not\nsurprising. Why would the temporary\ngranting of a monopoly not be desirable to the receiver?\nHowever, this view ignores a plethora of negative consequences to intellectual property, and I will list some\nhere. There is an impact on the creative output of society because people\nwho are innovating/inventing must\nnavigate a minefield of existing intellectual property, potentially having to\nuse inferior solutions to problems to\navoid infringing on them. There is an\nincrease in the amount of resources diverted to lawyers and litigation, rather\nthan productive output. Restricting\nthe number of competitors in a market\ninevitably slows advances in efficiency,\nthus lowering the productive output of\na society.\nAnother consequence is the delay\nof implementation of new ideas. In\nthe best case, this means that the entity with their temporary artificial monopoly will take their time making use\nof the new idea, and in the worst case\nit means people just sit on intellectual\nproperty and sue others, with no attempt at all to actually use the idea.\nI\u2019d like to discuss briefly the media\nindustry, as this is the clearest demonstration of some of the problems with\nintellectual property in my opinion.\nWhat we have here is a business\nmodel that is outdated and dying. The\nmedia companies are attempting to\nconflate this with the destruction of\nthe entire industry, but the reality is\nand distribute their own content. The\nmedia companies are cut out from this\nprocess, and obviously they don\u2019t like\nthat.\nRather than allowing people to consume music at lower prices and employing a more meritocratic business\nmodel for artists, both clearly better for\nsociety, the media companies are demonstrating for us that intellectual property as a concept is flawed. They have\ncreated a clear example, where even\naverage Joe can see the ridiculousness\nof fining a housewife millions of dollars\n(actually happened, more than once).\nIs it too much to hope people are beginning to question the legitimacy of\nintellectual property?\noceans and atmosphere have been infinite supplies for our purposes. These\ndays, because we have forgotten the\npoint of property rights, we are fumbling for solutions to the problem that\nthe oceans and atmosphere are no\nlonger practically infinite resources.\nSo, back to intellectual property.\nWhen I duplicate an idea, movie, etc, I\nhave not in effect \u201cstolen\u201d from some-one, since they still retain their copy of\nit and I have born the costs of duplication (e.g. electricity and internet bills)\nmyself. Since any and all humans can\nduplicate this object at no cost to existing copies, should we really consider it\nscarce?\nThe first obvious objection to this\nargument is that ideas themselves are\nscarce; we do have finite ideas, knowl-edge, and information. But, you must\nrealise that it is not the ideas themselves that are being claimed as prop-erty, rather the physical incarnations\nof them, like the commercial product,\nlike the electronic data file, etc.\nInstead, what intellectual property\ndoes is give a temporary artificial monopoly to someone over the creation\nand distribution of all copies of physical manifestations of an idea. I call it\nartificial because we can plainly see\nit is not a natural monopoly, it is en-As I am sure you are already aware,\nthere was an incident recently where\nGoogle all but explicitly accused the\nChinese Government of a virtual attack against it for political intelligence\ngathering and industrial espionage\npurposes.\nFor some bizarre reason, however,\nGoogle\u2019s reaction of threatening to\npull out of the Chinese market has\nbeen attributed to its displeasure with\ncensorship in China. The reality is\nthat Google is probably just angry\nand playing a PR game. When Google\noriginally entered China and accepted\ntheir censorship laws, it made the argument that the benefit of increased\naccess to information outweighed the\nnegatives of censorship. There\u2019s no\nreason to assume that this assessment\nhas changed.\nThis story is, in fact, simply a great\nillustration of Western hypocrisy. Numerous Western governments, and\ngovernments friendly to the West, have\ninternet censorship laws and snooping\nby the authorities. Just last week Australia state legislature passed a law requiring all internet commentators on\nelection issues to identify themselves\nwith their full name and post code.\nFurthermore, the method that the\nChinese hackers used to access Google\nwas a backdoor built into Gmail as per\nthe instructions of the US government\nso that they could violate people\u2019s pri-vacy. Again, numerous other Western\ngovernments also legislate backdoors\ninto software, and Google complies.\nWhile it would be nice to believe\nthat Google was making an ideological stand for privacy, the facts dictate\notherwise. Let us remove the log from\nour own eye first, and don\u2019t be fooled\nby selective outrage.\nOn Google, Chinese state hackers, and typical American government hypocrisy\nTop Google image search results for \u2018tiananmen square protest\u2019 - guess which one is taken from Google.cn?\ndifferent.\nWhat changed is that the Internet\nand computers made the duplication\nand distribution of their products effectively free. Most of them are apparently too stupid to realise this. They\ncling to the old business model (the\nexample here is music) where they\nmonopolised an artist and controlled\nthe entire process, from the recording\nequipment to the production of CDs.\nThey would sell the product in shops\nand take most of the revenue.\nIt\u2019s working less like that every day.\nNow what happens is a budding artist\ncan create his/her own fanbase through\nthe Internet. They can record themselves at much less expense, create\nEdwardTownes\nEdwardTownes Reporter\n\u201cPeople who\nare innovating\nmust navigate\na minefield of\nexisting intellectual\nproperty\u201d\n\n"

Researchers from\nImperial college London\nand Harvard university\nundertook more than\n40,000 trials to come up with crystals of sufficiently high quality to undergo x ray crystallograpy, the process wherein the\nstructureofamacromoleculemaybeelucidatedandvisualised\nin 3D. The scientists said that having the integrase structure\nmeans that researchers may now begin to fully understand\nhow integrase inhibitor drugs work, how they might be im-proved, and how to stop HIV developing resistance to them.\nBernard Pereira\nBernard Pereira\nTrousers tight around the waist? Diet\nnot working? Dreading the thought of\npounding the pavement in the uplifting grey cold outside?\nSave the sweat. In just half an hour,\nyou can now have your fat zapped away\nwith a blast of low intensity laser radiation that cuts through your fat cells and\nthe inches they make up. The technique\nhas already been approved in the US and\nin Europe, with clinical studies showing\na statistically significant reduction in\nwaist circumference in the subjects ex-amined. The procedure is founded on\nthe observations made by Rodrigo Neira\nin Canada (2001) that in vitro laser treatment of adipocytes (fat cells) resulted\nin the emulsion of intracellular fat: it\nseemed that the laser was disrupting the\nadipocyte plasma membrane and causing the release of the cellular contents,\nthereby destructing the cell.\nThis was expanded into a clinical set-ting, where patients undergoing liposuction were first treated with a laser,\nresulting in an increased volume of\nextracted fat during the operation as\ncompared to \u2018laserless\u2019 lipo. However,\nwith studies showing that laser therapy\nwas an effective fat-removal tool even\nwithout liposuction, the development\nof non-invasive laser lipolysis quickly\nensued. Here we are today then, able\nto have that elusive second serving, pop\ninto a clinic and quickly destroy all evidence of having consumed the same.\nHow does it work? Unfortunately\nwe\u2019re not quite sure at the moment, although we do have a rough idea. Transmission electron microscopy suggests\nthat laser treatment causes the formation of transient pores in the adipocyte\ncell membrane through which the cell\u2019s\nfatty contents can escape as it quickly\ndeflates. There obviously has to be some\nsort of photoacceptor molecule to respond to the laser, and it\u2019s likely that the\nwell-characterised cytochrome c oxidase\nis involved. This enzyme\u2019s function is\ncritical in the respiratory electron transport chain that is ultimately involved in\ngenerating ATP, the so-called \u2018molecular\nenergy currency of life\u2019\n. It has been suggested that laser therapy increases the\nrate of ATP synthesis by fundamentally\nincreasing the rate at which cytochrome\nc oxidase transports electrons. ATP\nsynthesis is normally tightly regulated\nand any changes in ATP levels can have\noutside yours cells.\nThese fats can\u2019t be excreted, and your\nbody has to therefore get rid of them\nusing other methods: whether these\ninvolve normal metabolic pathways or\nsome other system of fat degradation\nremains to be ascertained. As it turns\nout, it may be the case that the free fatty\nacids are being redistributed such that\nyou are increasing your chances of becoming affected by other diseases. So\nfar, however, there have been no noticeable problems with the treatment in its\nadmittedly short lifespan, and things\nseem safe for the moment.\nSo what, then, about the tried and\ntested methods used in the days when\n\u2013 God forbid \u2013 there were no slimming\npills, no lasers, no liposuction? Does\nthe old-fashioned diet and exercise fix\nstill have a role to play when I can take\na quick nap in a private clinic and wake\nup half an hour later, capable of seeing\nmy toes? Unfortunately, fat loss on its\nown does not necessarily equal good\nhealth: if you want to be in top shape,\nyou\u2019re still going to have to make the\neffort to pant the miles, as nothing (as\nyet!) ultimately beats the good old lifestyle changes and healthy choices.\nBesides, what good is it if you pay\nhundreds of pounds for a session of\nlaser lipolysis, not make those changes\nand begin to bulge again a week later?\nWhat is most likely is that the growing\nmarket for quick fixes is behind all the\nexcitement, with people ready to fish\nout the cash for temporary solutions,\nunwilling or too lazy to accept that there\nis no magic potion. What is especially\ninteresting is that some companies are\neven marketing laser-based fat removal\nas a cosmetic procedure, encouraging\nanyone who wants to improve their\nbody contour to give it a go irrespective\nof whether they are \u2018clinically\u2019 fat or not:\nsurely you want to look better?\nFrom this perspective, the laser diet\nmay be good for people who need it, but\nperhaps the age-old \u2018be happy with who\nyou are\u2019 adage should be considered before taking it any further.\nEye of newt...\nG major chord?\nBrigette Atkins\nBrigette Atkins Science Editor\nSuper hard diamonds\nfound in meteorite\nThe American Kennel\nClub has announced\nits annual list of most\npopular pure breeds,\nand once again the\nLabrador retriever has\nachieved the number\none ranking, as it has\ndone for the past 20\nyears.

Other\nplausible explanations do exist for laser\nlipolysis, including the possibility that\nlaser-induced changes in gene expression may influence membrane proteins\nin a manner which increases membrane\npermeability.\nIt\u2019s a fair point, however, that it may\nnot be so important to understand\nhow the adipocyte\u2019s membrane is disrupted \u2013 for some people, it is perhaps\nmore than enough to know that you\ncan crack open your fat cells and cause\nthem to collapse. On the other hand,\nit would be great to know where all\ntheir fatty contents go. Once your adi-pocytes have been blasted with a laser,\nyou would have an assortment of fatty\nacids, triglycerides and other stored\nmolecules passing through the transient pores into the extracellular space\nAn image of a generic laser\nL\nast week one of our regular\ncontributors emailed me\nregarding the 1023\nevent\nwhich took place last Saturday. The event, organised by\nthe Merseyside Skeptics Society, saw\naround 400 sceptics, including Simon\nSingh, take a homeopathic \u2018overdose\u2019\nin an attempt to show homeopathy for\nthe pseudo-science it is. Homeopathic\nremedies may be regarded as harmless\nplacebos at best. At worst, they mislead patients by providing an unproven\nalternative to conventional medicine\nand prolonging the period before\nproper medical help is sought.\nThe British Homeopathic Association claims that many remedies have\nbeen clinically proven to be effective\nat treating a variety of illnesses. According to their website, they are able\nto treat anything from ankle sprains to\nHIV infections. Homeopathy is based\non three principals laid out by its creator Samuel Hahnemann over 200 years\nago. The Law of Similars is the first concept which declares that the remedy to\nan illness may be got from what caused\nit in the first place, such as prescribing\ncaffeine for insomnia. The Law of Infinitesimals claims that the more dilute a\nremedy is, the more potent it becomes.\nMany homeopathic remedies are sold\nat 30C, that\u2019s 1 part original substance\nmixed with 99 parts water (or ethanol\ndepending on the solubility) diluted in\nthese proportions thirty times over. At\n12C any solution would reach what is\nknown as the Avogadro limit, meaning\nthe chances of you finding any molecule of the original substance within\nyour remedy are severely limited. The\nthird principle is the Law of Succession\nwhereby the dilution is shaken to increase its potency by helping the water\n\u2018remember\u2019 the original active ingredient it was mixed with.\nThese three principles go against\nmuch of our current understanding\nof science and medicine. The fact that\nthere is usually none of the original\nsubstance left within a remedy would\nsurely mean that the treatment would\nbe no more biologically active than distilled water. Homeopaths would disagree and say the water has \u2018memory\u2019.\nWe know comparatively little about\nliquids as states of matter go, and water\nis itself a peculiarity within this group.\nYet this gap in our knowledge is clearly\nexploited here. Even if water had this\n\u2018memory\u2019, how could it possibly use it\nto help cure a patient?\nThemaintroublewithhomeopathyis\nthat it has become so far removed from\nwell reasoned science and rigorously\ntested medicine. Many common drugs\nin use today seek inspiration from\nnaturally occurring compounds \u2013 such\nas aspirin, derived from salicylate-rich\nwillow bark. Where the herbal aspects\nof homeopathy may have some scientific reasoning, there are many aspects\nthat can only be described as bizarre,\nsuch as the potentisation of \u2018G major\nchord\u2019 \u2013 if anyone has an idea of what\nthat treats, I\u2019d be very interested to\nknow. In this way, homeopathy cannot\npossibly be viewed with much respect\nby most of the scientific world, yet the\nNHS spends \u00a34million a year on it.\nMany of us buy the treatments (ar-nica anyone?); the industry is worth\n\u00a340million per year. Many are adamant\nthat homeopathy \u2018just works\u2019. It seems\nsomewhere along the line, everything\nwe strive for in science such as thorough testing and well grounded theory\nhas been thrown to the wind. How\nhomeopathy has lasted so long, where\nany conventional medicine displaying\nsuch unsatisfactory results would have\nlong ago been dismissed, escapes me.\nOne thing I\u2019d like to know is if G major chord is soluble in water, or is an\nethanol based solution required?\n\n"

They face the threat of\nbeing banned from the use of College rooms and being charged to use\nspace in the Union as well if the behaviour does not stop. On Monday,\nUnion President Ashley Brown sent\nan email to every club highlighting the\nworst offences. This included considerable damage discovered in the newly\nrenovated gym and activity spaces after just a fortnight, inflicted by clubs\nwho failed to report it. Mr. Brown now\nwants to talk to whichever club left\npaint on the new floor to arrange for\nits removal.\nAnother issue is dumping of rubbish\nat the waste disposal unit in Beit. Commercial waste is removed from the bins\nin the unit in Beit Quad but when it\u2019s\nfilled with large debris by societies, the\ncouncil will no longer remove it, and\nrats are encouraged within the quad.\nCollege building managers have\ncomplained about rooms being persistently left in disarray, particularly in\nEEE and Huxley where there are large\nseminar rooms available, currently for\nno fee.\nThis is such a problem that they\nare threatening the clubs and societies with a ban from the use of College\nproperty. This would severely intensify\npressure on space in the Union, which\nis already struggling to provide the\nspace required.\nAshley Brown says he hopes spot\nchecks of the premises, and societies being asked to report on each\nother will force them to be more\nconscientious.\nClubs and societies have also been\nabusing the room bookings system,\nmeaning many rooms are booked and\nnot used, and some clubs are using\nrooms for unacceptable amounts of\ntime, given the pressure of up to 300\nsocieties trying to find somewhere to\nmeet. This comes after complaints\nabout the fiasco which means there\nwill be no Grand Finale at ArtsFest\nthis year due to the Great Hall being\nalready booked up. Mr. Brown threatened that, in order to prevent unscrupulous overbooking in the future,\npayment for Union rooms could be\nintroduced. This would squeeze every\nclub that makes use of these facilities.\nMr. Brown pointed out in his email\nthat after cuts in the Union\u2019s budget\nby the university, they would be attempting to recoup some of the money by renting out the newly renovated\nspaces in Beit over the summer.\nHe said this could be the source of\ntens of thousands of pounds if the\nrooms were in good condition, something the Union cannot afford to lose\nby allowing damage by individual\nclubs.\nRox Middleton\nRox Middleton\nSocieties in room\ntrouble with College\nKing\u2019s College London faces controversy and fierce opposition as they\nannounce plans to make cuts in the\nSchool of Arts and Humanities, including the firing of several internationally renowned academics.\nKCL\u2019s Department of Philosophy are\noutraged pending the forced retirement of Professor Charles Travis and\nlecturers Dr. Wilfried Meyer-Viol and\nDirector of Graduate Studies Professor\nShalom Lappin.\nProfessor Lappin commented online\nthat he was \u2018\u2019summoned without warning\u2019\u2019 by the Head of Arts and Humanities and told that his \u2018\u2019position would\nbe redundant as of September\u2019\u2019.\nProfessor Lappin claims to have\nturned down a position at Hebrew\nUniversity\u2019s Computer Science Department after being assured that his\njob at King\u2019s was secure by the same\nHead that informed him of his upcoming redundancy.\nA group of graduate students have\nwritten a letter which has been pre-Alex Karapetian\nAlex Karapetian\nsented to management, to which they\nawait a response.\nThese cuts, called \u2018\u2019callous\u2019\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2019reckless\u2019\u2019 by the Research Assessment Exercise, were described by a\nletter of opposition from UCL and\nother universities\u2019 academic staff as\n\u201csavage\u2019\u2019, and that \u201csuch a reduction of\nstaff numbers through compulsory redundancy removes any appearance of\njob security for academics at King\u2019s.\u2019\u2019\nThe letter adds: \u2018\u2019The best candidates\nin the humanities will shun the insti-tution, and those of strong standing\nnow in post will all seek to leave.

Those weeks where almost\nnothing happens of any worth are the\nones when you try to prepare for, you\nthink you\u2019ve prepared for, but when\npush comes to shove, you haven\u2019t really.\nWell last week was the push, and this\nweek\u2019s the callous shove into an oblivion of unfilled and pointless headlines.\nNow,I\u2019mnotsayingtheheadlineswe\u2019ve\nrun with this week are pointless, and\nthey\u2019re clearly not unfilled; there\u2019s black\non white as you can see for yourself. The\nweeks of oblivion are the ones where the\neditors and writers have to dig deep and\nreally dredge out topical and interesting\narticles for you to read. Mining for stories\nthat are both is taxing, so I really do hope\nyou appreciate this week\u2019s issue.\nAnyone who uses the Student Activities Centre in the Union will have\nprobably seen me relentlessly hunting down members of staff or certain\nDeputy Presidents of the Union, and\nthe result of it is that this week\u2019s news\nis quite hacky. I can only apologise. If\nyou don\u2019t know what a \u2018hack\u2019 is, it is the\ntype of person that thinks the Union\nand its associated politics are the most\nimportant agenda in the world. They\nhave an unnervingly concise knowledge and overstated opinion on every\nlittle aspect of the Union, from the internal society claim forms to constitution updates. Everything in Beit Quad\nis integral to the running of the nation,\nand a hack wouldn\u2019t be half-surprised if\nGordon Brown marched into Beit and\nannounced that he was taking over the\noperations were so important.\nBy definition, I am a hack. I need to\nbe, really. I have to understand Union\npolitics like it\u2019s simple integration by\nnumbers of four-compound alpha-uranium-produced matrices, otherwise\nI couldn\u2019t do my job. However, I do try\nand detach myself from the world of\nhackery and hopefully I\u2019ll come out of\nthis job alive. I\u2019ve tried to keep articles\nabout Union finances and politics simple and structured, because the matters\nbeing discussed do matter to everyone,\nI promise. People just won\u2019t care if they\nhave to sieve through the silly terms the\nUnion use like \u201cExecutive Reserve\u201d.\nJoking aside, after last year\u2019s rocky\nrelationship, felix and the Union have\na decent understanding this year. This\nis evidenced by their willingness to run\nthe competition to rename the Union\nbars through the paper. The best (pos-sibly worst) way of describing this is\nif both felix and the Union had Facebook profiles (which I\u2019m convinced\nthey both do). felix would be in an\n\u2018Open Relationship with Imperial College Union\u2019. We feed off\neach other, we both have needs\neach other can provide, but felix\nisn\u2019t scared of turning around on\nthe Union, stamping on its feet\nand putting a gun to its head\ndemanding answers when need\nbe. It\u2019s just we\u2019re still waiting for\nthat time when we can get our\nrifle out and load it.\nSee, 500 words or so and I\nhaven\u2019t made a single cat pun\nlike I usually do. I think you\u2019ve all\nrealised felix is a feline creature by\nnow without me making what I deem\nclever quips about claws and\npussies and whatnot.\nUnion President\nAshley Brown\nsent out a\nthreatening email\nwarning clubs\nand societies\nabout the misuse\nof College rooms\nbooked through\nthe Union.\nmanifestly mediocre.\u2019\u2019\nImperial has come under similar\nscrutiny in the past for proposing\ncuts to make 60% of foreign language\nclasses offered to undergraduates\nfor credit disappear by 2010. Being\na largely scientific community, many\nstudents believed the department\nwas paramount to maintain foreign\nlanguage proficiency due to its desirability in employment.\nAs well as the cuts in the Departments of Computer Science and\nPhilosophy, concerns arose in KCL\nregarding further cuts in the Department of Music and the closure of the\nPaleography department.\nThe Times reports that KCL had\nintent to make 22 academics redundant in Arts and Humanities, while\nthe lecturers union called an emergency meeting for February 10th due\nto the estimated 205 posts at risk and\nup to 533 jobs which could be lost.\nA spokesperson from King\u2019s College London was not able to comment due to \u2018\u2019prioritising our own\nstudent communications at the\nmoment.\u2019\u2019\n\n"

It\nused to be the case that we could consign those memories to the deepest,\ndarkest depths of our minds and that\nwould be the end of it. But now, with\nthe technological wonder that is Facebook, everything in our lives is pasted\nonline for the world to see. What we\nforget sometimes is exactly who can\nsee, unaware that relatives, employers\nor even just regular strangers can easily access our information. For most of\nus, the worst that can happen is that\nour relatives catch a glimpse of humiliating photos, but it can be a whole lot\nworse. What follows are some (admit-tedly hilarious) precautionary tales of\nwhat happens when our privacy goes\ndown the pan.\nIf you take a look through the Facebook photos of a standard 18-year-old, it\u2019s pretty likely that at some point\nyou\u2019re going to come across pictures\nof alcohol, its consumption or after\neffects. This was particularly true for\nCaitlin Davis, an NFL cheerleader\nfor the New England Patriots who\nwas captured on camera scrawling\non a passed-out friend in permanent\nmarker. That\u2019s certainly nothing too\nunusual, but when her bosses at the\nteam caught sight of the photos and\nsaw that many of the \u2018messages\u2019 were\nanti-Semitic and racist, she was quickly booted from the team. Protests that\nshe \u2018hadn\u2019t seen\u2019 the drawings had no\neffect, so she was left jobless and presumably wondering why she hadn\u2019t\nsorted out her profile privacy sooner.\nFor one Australian restaurateur, social networking actually helped him\ntrack down some rogue diners. Five\nsharp eaters, after working up a considerable tab at the bar, took a table and\nproceeded to \u2018work their way up the\nmenu,\u2019 running up a final bill of $520\n(about \u00a3300). The group then \u2018went\noutside for a smoke\u2019 and, er, disap-peared. Fortunately one of the men hit\non a waitress and gave her his name,\nwhich the manager used to track him\ndown on Facebook. The profile told\nhim the guy worked at a nearby restaurant and so, after a lengthy phone\ncall with the boss, the offenders were\nmarched down and ordered to pay the\nbill along with a weighty tip. To top it\nall off, they were all later sacked.\nOne of the most infamous violations\nof Facebook privacy happened last\nJuly when the wife of the new head of\nMI6 posted holiday pictures, details of\nwhere they lived and who their close\nfriends were and forgot to make the\ninformation private. By forgetting to\nchoose the right settings, Lady Shelly\nSawers effectively got her and her family closer to being taken hostage or\nkilled. Not only was this an embarrassing cock-up for the Government, but\nseveral experts also strongly suggested\nthat \u2018the Sawers family will almost certainly need to be re-housed and the\nchildren may require extra protection.\u2019\nNice one!\nAnother example of a student getting busted is the case of Erika Scoliere, a 20-year-old from the University\nof Dayton, Ohio. Early in 2007, Erika\nwas found guilty of drunk driving after a fatal collision with a motorcyclist.\nShe was put on parole on the condition that she was not to drink alcohol\nor even be around anyone who had it.\nAll of this was fine until police detectives examined her Facebook profile\nand found many recent albums showing her drinking heavily with friends\nand passing out. The judge was kind\nenough not to send her directly to jail,\nbut instead decreed that she must now\nwear a SCRAM bracelet: an electronic\ntag that alerts the police if alcohol is\ndetected in the body.\nOur final case is less about privacy\nand more about general idiocy. When a\nhomeowner in Pennsylvania returned\nhome one evening to find her house\nburgled, she didn\u2019t expect to see the\ncriminal\u2019s Facebook profile open and\nlogged in on her computer. Jonathon\nParker stole more than $3,500 worth\nof goods but just couldn\u2019t resist the Facebook addiction long enough to feel\nthe need to log in at the house he had\nbroken into (status update: \u2018burgling a\nhouse lol\u2019?). Police quickly moved in,\narrested him and recovered the goods.\nJonathon now faces a maximum of ten\nyears in prison.\nAlthough all these incidents are pretty extreme, the message remains the\nsame: be aware of who can see your information and photos. In a recent sur-vey, it was found that a whopping 70%\nof employers not only look at potential\napplicants online, but have actually rejected applicants because of what they\nsaw on Facebook or MySpace. It was\nalso found that one third had fired employees because of negative comments\nagainst the company on their profiles.\nIf any one of the victims above had\ntaken a minute to review their privacy\nonline, these stories might not have\nended quite so tragically. Don\u2019t be a\nn00b, learn from them, and make sure\nyou don\u2019t make the same mistakes!\nI\nnternet privacy: is it a misno-mer? Should you care about the\ninformation you so readily stream\nonto the internet? Well this week\nwe\u2019ve got an interesting and eye-open-ing report on the state of Facebook privacy from Simon, something everyone\nshould take a look at. It\u2019s hard enough\ngetting a decent job after university, let\nalone being hampered by some daft\nphotos of your youthful, or not so, self,\ncarparked with a cock drawn on your\nface.\nOf course we\u2019re still in the wake of\nthe Earth-shattering iPad announce-ment, where\u2019s that SarcMark when you\nneed it eh? Bit sceptical that the iPad is\ngoing to change your life? Well, Feroz\nhas taken a look at some of Apple\u2019s potential competitors in the tablet computing market for you to peruse; you\nmight find something that you like.\nThe Tories entered my realm of reporting this week with their 100Mbps\nbroadband promise. George Osborne,\nShadow Chancellor, said that the Tories would deliver 100Mbps broadband speeds to the \u2018majority\u2019 of homes\nin the UK by 2017. OK, sounds good,\nbut how are they going to make it hap-pen? After all, we\u2019re quite a long way\noff at the moment with an average UK\nspeed of just 4.1Mbps. Well, Osborne\nthinks that the BBC should pay for it. A\n3.5% chunk of the Beeb licence fee that\nwas set aside for the digital switchover\nwould be made available for private investors to upgrade their infrastructure.\nLabour also has a smaller scope promise on broadband speed of 2Mbps to\nthe majority of homes by 2012, which\nthey intend to fund with a \u00a36 tax on\nevery landline in the country. Whichever government gets into power next\nterm, it\u2019s clear that the UK broadband\ninfrastructure needs some investment\nif we are to keep up with the high-speed world.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nApart from the odd Apple an-nouncement, the weeks following CES are traditionally a\nbit of a dry spell for tech news.\nThis week we\u2019ve scoured the\ninterwebs to find you the latest\nin tech you might have missed.\nFirst up a revelation that\ndidn\u2019t really shock me: Britain\nsent 96.8 billion texts last year.\nThat\u2019s 265 million a day winging their way across the net-works. I don\u2019t know about you\nbut I send quite a few texts,\nbut perhaps less now that IM,\nemail and social networking\nsites are on your phone.\nSpeaking of text messaging,\na US 16-year-old showed the\nworld that there\u2019s no limits he\nwon\u2019t go to send a text. Using\na low-frequency radio, Alexander Kendrick managed to send\na text from over 300m under-ground, making it the deepest\nknown underground digital\ncommunication ever in the US\nand won him the Science Fair.\nOf course updating your Twitter status to \u2018It\u2019s real dark down\nhere\u2019 is great, but a practical\nuse could be to keep cave rescuers in contact with each other easily and efficiently, something that takes laying miles of\ntelephone cable currently.\nMonopoly,\nthe classic family property\nboard game,\nhas gotten a\nrefresh and gone\nall high-tech on us for its 75th\nanniversary. Not only has\nit gotten a new circular lay-out, like a round-a-bout, but\nthey\u2019ve ditched the old Monopoly money for Chip\u2019n\u2019Pin\ncash cards. No longer will you\nbe able to slyly pilfer from the\nbank, nor is there any need for\na banker at all as it\u2019s all handled\nby a central computer on the\nboard itself.\nMore from gaming gadgets\nthis week in the form of a remote controlled Chinook. Spin\nMaster are set to release the\nR/C Cargo Commander in the\nsummer this year for whirly-bird fans seeking a bit more\nfrom your RC toy. The mini-marvel can carry and release\non command three pieces of\nincluded cargo; a container, a\nrescue boat and a jeep.\nOf course there\u2019s\nno reason\nyou can\u2019t\nrig\nup a\nwater\nballoon\nto this bad boy\nand drop it on unsuspecting victims.\nMore China espionage accusations came out this week this\ntime revolving around freebie flash drives. According to\nMI5, who issued a warning to\nUK businesses, the idea is that\nsome hapless worker sticks\nsaid freebie into his computer\nunwittingly infecting the corporate network with trojans\nand viruses. Of course you can\neasily avoid such hassles by\nplugging the thing into a Mac\nand formatting it, after all you\ndon\u2019t want to waste a freebie\nnow do you?\nGoogle has hit the news this\nweek for two decent turns.\nFirst up was the announcement that Google is joining the\nfight to get rid of the bane of\nthe internet that IE 6 is. From\nMarch 1st older browsers including IE6 will cease to be\nable to access Google Apps\nincluding Google Docs. With a\nbit of luck, combined with the\nco-ordinated campaign from\nover 70 companies, including\nMicrosoft, they will be able to\nrid the world of the 9-year-old\nbrowser.\nGoogle took the first step to\ntransitioning the internet over\nto IPv6 this week. It quietly enabled support for the IPv4 replacement on YouTube, the 3rd\nmost popular website on the\ninternet.

I\u2019ve\nstarted to think about the\nGovernment\u2019s recent idea\nthat is necessary, almost vital, for children of the age of five to seven need to\nbe learned in the subject of sex educa-tion. Thus is opposed to sorting out\nthe meltdown we find ourselves in.\nPersonally, I am not too sure how many\nkids aged five are having it off behind\nthe bike sheds, or fence to which bikes\nare chained if they\u2019re in a scummy\nschool, but I\u2019ll stick my neck out and\nsay not one. To further that, I am prepared to bet that many don\u2019t spent\nsignificant amount of time reflecting\non sex, so they needn\u2019t be aware of\nthat shit anyway. So who thinks of this\ndiatribe? Jim Knight, the Schools Minister. Speaking in the Commons, he\nsaid: \u201cThe international evidence suggests that teaching aspects of sex and\nrelationship education before puberty\nhas a positive effect on such things as\nteenage pregnancy rates and sex education.\u2019\u201d Twat. (Although I must point\nout that those are my dots).\nStephen Burgess, National Director\nof Life Education Centres, agreed with\nhim, saying: \u201cIf we want to make a real\nand lasting difference to teenage drug\nand alcohol misuse, we must reach\nthem early \u2013 at primary school. Then,\nthey can make informed decisions\nbased on fact rather than hearsay.\u201d\nRight, at five, kids are too young to\neven find drawing a penis funny, let\nalone understand what to do with the\nthing- and don\u2019t bring beer into this,\nwhere\u2019s that come from?\nWhen I first heard about this, I\nadmit, I was so overcome with one\npounding thought that I needed to\ntake a few minutes just to consider\n\u2018WHAT THE F*CK IS GOING ON IN\nTHESE PEOPLE\u2019S MINDS?\u2019.\nWith useless wankers like that populating the upper tier of government,\nhell knows who they bring in at the\nbottom. Probably a tourist, or one of\nthose retarded activists who camp outside the Houses of Parliament. They\nneed to re-assess their lives for start-ers. Look mate, you\u2019re living in a tent,\nand pissing in a bucket- even the cavemen lived in caves, hence the name.\nWhatever you\u2019re campaigning for, can\nyou not possibly, just possibly, piss off\nand shout at someone else?\nStuff Imperial\nstudents don\u2019t like:\nCoursework, we all have it, and\nwe all spend an age on a single\nmaths problem. And by and age, I\nmore often than not mean hours\nand bloody hours. Why not just\ntake a step back and think \u2018woah,\nthis piece, even if I get 100% will\ncontribute 0.001% to your whole\ndegree. Fuck it, I\u2019m off to the bar.\u2019\nBut we don\u2019t do we. We plod on\nthrough, copying mates as and\nwhen we can, eventually, stumbling\nalong to an answer. Unfortunately\nyour answers are more often than\nnot incorrect so you have completely wasted your time for absolutely no gain. Well done.\nHowever the other side to that\ncoin is that if you do sod all, then\neventually you\u2019re going to be get\nkicked out. Which would somewhat\nspoil your day. Meh. You win some\nand you lose some- that would defiantly classify as a major overall\nloss. Then you\u2019ll not be able to get\na job. Then you\u2019ll get addicted to\nskag (for why I have no idea). Then\nyou\u2019ll have to turn to robbery and\nprostitution to make ends meet.\nStill could be worse.\nmmmmmm.....\nWordpath 1,452\nHow to play:\nMake a path from the origin word to the destination\nword by taking steps between words using one of the\nthree following methods:\nLetter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD\nAnagram: Rearrange the letters.\ne.g. WARD -> DRAW\nWordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter\nword from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.\ne.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)\nNo consecutive steps may be made by the same method.\ne.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would\nbe invalid.\nPoints are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path\nbetween the two words.

If a five year old\ncan\u2019t even see the underlying story of\nBob the Builder, and his obvious lust\nfor Wendy, then how are they expected\nto understand sex? So leave the leave\nthe poor little fuckers alone yeah?\u201d\nWe\u2019ve all noticed it\u2026 Just shag the\nbitch, Bob.\nWith people like Knight proposing\nliteral shit, no wonder that Sir Peter\nViggers managed to claim \u00a31,645 for\na duck house.
