Francophiles\nwanted\nDear Judith,\nYou may remember the exchange visits that took place\nlast year between students from IC and ESPCI (Ecole\nSuperieure de Physique et Chemie Industrielle) in Paris.\nThe exchange involved industrial, academic and cultural\nevents in both London and Paris and was judged by all\ninvolved to have been a great success. However, the\norganisers have now left College and unfortunately have\nnot passed on their roles.\nThe students of ESPCI have sent a draft of their\nproposals for a1988 exchange. If this is to go ahead, plans\nmust be made for industrial sponsorship, travel and\naccommodation, industrial visits and social events. Weu rgen dy need a team of enthusiastic franc ophile s(?) both\nstaff and student, to get the ball rolling. If any of your\nreaders would like to be involved please will they drop\nme a note as soon as possible. A bien to t! Sue Browne,\nElec Eng IV.\nClear image\nproblem\nDearest,\nI 've heard talk of 'Freshers apathy'. I'm a first year .\nand have some comments. First some problems with IC. .\nIts image attracts apathetic applicants trying to avoid \u2022\nhassles. The high entrance requirements mean most.\nstudents are studi ers, and better than average ly well off..\nThus less Union support and less outgoing people. All. science students and few women leads to an atmosphere\nnot conducive to creativity, or anything much. The large\noverseas contingent spend much of their time learning to\nlive in London. The Union is the least of their worries.\nIC should be helping these students develop socially not\ncomplaining about them.\nThere are however plenty of 'active students'. Did they\ngo to the U GM? No. The Union labels them apathetic.\nStudent opinion: 'There must be something more\ninteresting to do'. A clear image problem. Despite the\npublicity students saw no more than an extended lunch\nbreak. It wasn't something they felt they should go to,\nas opposed to 'Freshers events' which they were, and.\nwhich were well attended. How about having the U GM2.30 to 4.30pm with lectures before and after and reps\nreminding everyone just before-hand. I don't know if this\ncould be timetabled. Then the message would be: 'It's something you do while at College' not 'come if you've .\nnothing else to do'. Better organisation is required. Some\npeople had to leave without voting to attend lectures.\nAnother good example was the RCS Laserium trip, ie\nequally badly attended, about 4 first years out of 23\n(mainly Union hacks). Again image failure. A rep came\nto the lecture theatre and invited 200 people to come. Not\nvery personal. Most students thought: yes very interesting,,\nbut they don't mean me, what shall I do instead. It failed\nto reach 'Freshers event' status. Most people I know in\nmy house went on a pub crawl invitation instead. Now the first year reps have been elected I hope they are used\neffectively. Had half a dozen reps gone round inviting\nsmall groups personally to come along and bring friends\nthe attendance would have been much higher. It's harder\nto turn down a personal invitation.\nIC does suffer from apathy, but it's not incurable. People\nin the appropriate position just have to give things a push.\nPeople will get involved if encouraged, and wonder why\nthey weren't going anyway (take Freshers' Week). The\npush can take many forms as in the examples. It's up to\nthe active people to encourage the rest.\nLuv,\nCambel Si, Physics 1.\nPS. I went to everything all Freshers Week events, tid d ly winks, U GM, and the laser i um trip. Most people's opinion\nof me: quiet, introverted, not the outgoing type. A fair\ndescription I suppose. So why did I go. Just curious to\nsee what was going on. I probably fall into the category\nor, had nothing better to do.\nLower forms\nof life\nDear Judith,\nAlthough term is a mere three weeks old, much criticism\nhas already been directed at us Freshers so I feel it is about\ntime that someone stood up and hit back.\nFirstly, the U GM. Fresher 'apathy' and 'no interest in\nthe Union' we were told in the aftermath of the dismal\nattendance. As any student knows, Freshers are laden with\nbooklets, pamphlets and numerous other bits of paper of\nvarying interest on arrival at Imperial. Therefore a small\nparagraph in the Freshers Handbook is easily missed.\nWhat about the posters, I hear you cry? There are literally\nhundreds of posters up around Imperial that are for the\nmost part of very little interest, so one soon becomes\noblivious to all but the most eye-catching of them. A far\nbetter way of public ising the meeting would have been\nto stress its importance at the Freshers Reception where,\nif my memory serves me correctly, it was not even\nmentioned.\nAnd what of the Union? If we are to believe what we\nread in the pages of FELIX, the Exec (especially Mr Howgate) are a bunch of egocentric, power-crazed,\nmindless cretins, incapable of organising a grannies tea\nparty! Hardly likely to endear us impressionable Freshers\nto the Union, or indeed encourage us to attend UG Ms. In replying to the above criticism in your last editorial\nyou said, 'It doesn't really effect you anyway'. This is\ntypical of the attitude of student bodies and organisations\ntowards Freshers. We all appreciate the great work that\nyou are doing for us but I do object to Freshers being\ndepicted as some sort of moronic, lower form of life. One\nonly has to look as far as the election of a Fresher\n(congratulations Tanya) as Guilds VP to see that the\nFreshers of 87 mean business.\nYours d is grunted ly, Simon Holden.\nA long, long, long time ago I was a Fresher and I don't doubt that this year's intake 'mean business'.

    "content": "F\" EEI I This week has been one of those\nnightmare weeks where there's too\nlittle space with too much to put into\nit. Not only this but all the Print\nUnit machinery has gone\nhaywire\u2014this may mean that I will\nhave to be selective about what goes\ninto FELIX for the next few weeks.\nSpecial Rag Issue\nIn two weeks time (13.11.87)\nFELIX will be devoting itself to\nRag Week. 25% of income raised\nthrough advertising in that issue will\nbe given to Rag. We will also be\ncharging at least 20p to Rag for\neach small ad or diary entry we\nprint. Please support our efforts by\nputting as many small ads in as you\ncan possibly afford!\nNext week's issue will preview\nall the events lined up for Rag\nWeek.\nSoul Searching\nIn this week's issue we have printed\nyet another article about the soul.\nThis will be the last one as the\nsubject is now getting a little\nhackneyed (ged d it?). I suggest that\nthe rest be left to Debating Society.\nNo Censorship\nLast week I was asked why FELIX\nhas stopped printing the President's report on the Union page. It seems\nthat many of you believe that I am\nrefusing to include anything written\nby him. This could not be further\nfrom the truth. Sad to say, Mr\nHowgate has not submitted a Presidential Report to me since the\nFreshers' Issue.\nSouthside Fire Alarms\nThose damned fire alarms went off\nagain this week in the early hours\nof Monday morning. I had just put\nmy dressing gown and slippers on\nand locked my door when it was\nswitched off. This alarm fiasco has\nbeen going on ever since I 've been\nat College. Never fear, though,\nyou'll know when the fire's a real\none: all wardens have been\ninstructed to shout up the staircases\nand from Princes Gardens 'It's a real fire. Get out!'. Whoever\nthought that one up has less brain\npower than Dave Tyler. With the\nI alarms cutting out all other sounds,\nhow are we meant to hear the odd\nwarden shouting at us from the\ngardens? So until College finally\nsort the whole system out, my\nadvice is don't ignore the alarms\nand listen out for your frantic\nwarden's voice!\nElectronic Media\nThe first meeting of Publication's Board this year met last Monday.\nI was saddened to hear that both IC\nRadio and STOIC are suffering\nfrom their massive membership\nfees. IC Radio has only 28 members\nso far, IC Radio is meant to\nbroadcast over 100 hours each\nweek. You don't need an '0' level\nin Mathematics to work out that\nsome people have to do an awful lot\nof broadcasting to maintain the\noutput required. The electronic\npublications may not serve as many\npeople as FELIX but they still\nprovide a valuable service. I think\nit's time to realise that publications\nare different from other clubs at IC\nand that any person should be\nallowed to contribute to these\nservices without having to pay out\nof their own pockets.\nPrint Unit\nThere is now a month's waiting list\nfor printing.

    "content": "MENS HOCKEY Rout prevented\nIC l st3 Sussex University 1st \u20140\nIC l sts \u20141\nAshford\u20143\nIC l sts began a long Saturday with\na30 win in a rearranged U AU game\nagainst Sussex at Harlington. Coming\nforward from the start, IC were soon\nin the lead. Although 3 goals were\neventually scored, only fine\ngoal keeping and inept attacking\nprevented a rout. Paul Skip worth,\nadding two to this season's tally of\nfive, seemed the only player who\nknew what to do when presented with\nan open goal.\nAfter the afternoon's entertainment,\nwatching the 2nd team beaten 6-2 by\nOM T2 nds, the l sts were chauffeur\ndriven to the astroturf at Feltham\nSchool. The game started explosively\non the faster surface, with Middlesex\nleague opposition Ashford soon\nworking an opening goal. Shaken, IC\nadjusted their game to the pitch and\nwere quickly holding their own.\nNow, playing the best hockey of the\nyear so far, IC put pressure on the\nopposition but barely penetrated their\npenalty ' D'. Failing to make any\nimpression attacking on the right,\npartly due to excellent covering work\nby Richard, Ashford pressed on the\nleft side of the IC defence during the\nsecond half. Despite stout work, the\nunsupported Brooking was regularly\noverrun, leaving only Stonham and\nGarside to defend the IC goal. Having\nfound the way through, Ashford\nstruck twice in rapid succession,\nleaving the omni scoring Skipworth's goal from a short corner as a mere\nconsolation. Ashford won 3-1.\nThanks go to 2nd team skipper Andy\nLewis for his sideline inspiration.\nORIENTEERING\nArmy training\nLast Sunday, the Orienteering Club\nwent to an event in Stroud near\nRochester; the weather, for a change,\nwas excellent.\nThe event was very well organised\nby the Royal Engineers and most of\nthe terrain was mapped out on their\ntraining grounds. Consequendy, there\nwere many controls sited on features\nsuch as World War Two bunkers and\nseveral warning signs saying 'danger\nhigh voltage fence' and 'beware,\nbooby traps'. However, this did not\ndeter any members from completing\nthe course but a few were cautious\nwondering in which fields the mines\nhad been placed!\nThe green course (described by the\narmy as 'heavy going') had a particularly gruesome control placed\nin the middle of an in penetrable forest. Orienteers had to literally fight\ntheir way through.\nTraining is as usual on Thursday\n5.30pm in the Union Gym with post\nmortem s of previous week's events\nand arrangements for the following\nweek being made.\nSAILING\nFoot Trophy\nLast weekend saw the IC sailing team\nin their first match, in the Foot\nTrophy, organised by ex-University\nof London sailors at Welsh Harp\nReservoir. In this first match of the\nseason the team showed great promise\nwith new helms Bill Chard and Rob\nKimberly showing consistent sailing.\nThe highlight of the weekend was\na very satisfying win for IC against\nthe University of London first team.\nAt the start, a gres sion by Apostolous\nLeonhidopolous forced the UL captain away, allowing IC to take a commanding lead with first and\nsecond places. Unfortunately at the\nfirst mark a mistake by Rob Kimberly\nallowed UL to regain second place\nand they capitalised on it to take third\nplace as well. However, IC were still\nin the running and pulled back slowly\nso that at the finish they had regained\nsecond and third places to finish first,\nsecond and third.\nTeam: Robert Kimberly, Carol\nEastwick, Bill Chard, Richard\nJarman (Capt), Sam Page, Daniel\nLucas-Clements, Apostolous\nLeonhidopolous, Richard Morris.\nFENCING\nFirst round of UAU\nThis year IC Fencing Club will be\nhosting the first round of the U AU. In addition there will be a number of\nfriendly matches this term. There will\nbe team trials tonight in the Union\nGym for all the experienced fencers\nwho didn't turn up at last week's team\ntrials.\nFriendly matches:\nIC vs Morely\u2014Nov 13\nIC vs QM C Nov27 The Fencing Club caters for both\nexperienced fencers and beginners\nwith professional coaching on\nThursdays. All equipment is provided\nby the club. Any women fencers with\neven the tiniest amount of experience,\nwe are hoping to have a ladies team\nthis year for the first time in many\nyears. So please come along and\nfence.\nRUGBY Convincing win\nfor IC\nIC 1st XV24 Sussex 1st XV \u2014 1 3\nIC started their U AV campaign with\na convincing win. After an initial\nsetback, S Smith motivated the large\nand mobile pack which began to\ndominate up front leading to good\npossession from which S Hall crossed\nfor the first of his two tries. The\nforwards then tightened up the next\nplay and Pete Galley touched down\nfrom a five yard scrum. After halftime IC stepped up the pressure and\nenterprising play in the three quarters\nset up tries for J Sharp and S Hall on\nthe wings. From a penalty move ten\nyards out E MacLean picked up a scrappy ball and a drive over from\nfive yards to finish the scoring. This\nwas a very encouraging and\npromising result for IC with man of\nthe match J F Blamo at fullback.\nImpressive start\nto UAU\nIC 2nd XV21 Sussex 2nd XV0 An impressive start to the U AU competition saw IC 2nd XV stroll\nhome against an inferior Sussex 2nd XV. Captain D Davies motivated his\naggressive pack into a murderous\nfrenzy shortly before kick off which\nlead to total domination by the IC\nforwards in the set pieces and loose\nplay. Tries flowed from D Davies (2)\nand, K Dolan and Jonathon Menitt,\nwith outstanding support play from D Clapp, JR Peacock and A Dixon. The\nbacks ran strongly and swift hands in\nthe centres allowed a lot of space for\nthe attacking fullback and wings.\nMan of the Match: K Dolan\nIC 3rd vs Sussex 3rd XV Sussex failed to raise a team which\ngives IC a default win.\n20 Friday October 30th1987 FELIX\n\n"

This article describes three\nsuch services, one on-campus and two\noff, which are available free of charge\nfrom most computer terminals in\nCollege.\nLON. LIB The perfect antidote to a long book\nlist, the London Libraries system\nallows you to check for availability\nof books and other material in\nlibraries here at IC. A book can be\nidentified exactly by quoting an ISBN\nor LC CARD number, or it can be\nfound by browsing through given an\nauthor or title.\nThe computer will tell you roughly\nin which party of the library the book\nis to be found, what type the book is\n(reference, short term loan, long term\nloan etc.) and whether the book is in\nthe library at the moment you\nenquire.\nIn case the particular book you\nwant is not in the library, the system\nalso checks in all the other\nparticipating university libraries in\nLondon. Most useful of these is ULL, the University of London Library at\nSenate House, Malet Street.

All your\nfavourite characters appear in some\nguise or another, Lady Penelope,\nBrains, Jeff, Parker and even\nStingray's Marina.\nTechnically the mime is superb in\nits own right, for example the\nportrayals of crashing waves or huge\nwaterfalls are convincing, and with\nthe added advantage of such a well-known series it is fabulously detailed\n(remember the collapsible palm trees\non the launch of Thunderbird 2). Any\npauses are neatly filled with the well-known music which cleverly evokes\nthe atmosphere of the original.\nThe energetic duo are moving on\nto new ground in the shape of 7\n7\n1\n^ Six\nSided Man inspired by Luke Rhinehart's The Dice Man, so catch\nthis before it finishes on Saturday!\nA.N. Albums\nPet Shop Boys\nActually\nMore from the dull duo in the same\nsuccessful style as Please. This time\nthere's more gloss and less content,\nwith the same mix of depression disco\nand em baras sing ballad. Great singles\n(It's a Sin, What Have I Done to\nDeserve This, Rent) and the tongue-in-cheek SHOPPING We're\nShopping makes up for the\nem baras sing It Couldn't Happen\nHere. Well crafted pop with just the\nright measure of self-consciousness\nand intelligence.\nA.N. Live\nBryan Adams\u2014Wembley\nAfter the sweet, raunchy melodies of\nT 'Pau in the first half of the show,\nBryan Adams had a lot to do to\nmaintain the quality of this show.\nBryan bust on to stage in a modest\nblack shirt and blue jeans, and from\na distance looked not unlike IC DP Alan Rose.\nSwirling rhythm and blues guitar,\nsolid rock drumming and of course\nMUSKBryan's gruff yet tuneful vocals all\nwent together to make the perfect\ningredients for an exciting and\natmospheric concert (shock-atmosphere at Wembley Arena!)\nThe show was made up of the best\nof his last two albums Heat of the\nNight and Reckless, with a few old\nfavourites thrown in for die hard fans.\nThe best reactions of the night were\ngiven to songs like Reckless, Run to\nYou, Somebody and Summer of 69\nwhich was excellent as the finale.\nThe new songs are not quite as\ncommercial, with fewer out-and-out\nrockers, they do however show a lot\nof maturity and of course still\nmaintain that killer hook line. My personal favourite of the night\n(if you exclude the lead singer from\nT 'Pau) was the moving Nature Sons\na song for the American Indians\nwhich makes you sit back and simply\nthink.\nD.W. Thomas Greig\nAaron Kotcheff\nAlex Noble\nDave Williams\nWho's That Girl\nThat girl is Madonna playing Nikki\nFinn, who having just been released\nfrom gaol, crashes head first into the\nwell ordered, successful and\nextremely sensible life of Loudon\nTrotts (Griffen Dune), completely\ndestroying it within a few hours. Of course the result is a transformed\nwacky and exciting Loudon.\nIt is a film full of stereotypes:\nMadonna is as usual at arty streetwise\nversion of Mickey Mouse; the rich\nfather; two hoodlums; the plain\nclothed cops; the highway patrolmen;\nthe dumb fiance; the disgustingly\nwealthy eccentric and a Rolls Royce\nthat gradually gets wrecked, all\ncombining to make an unremarkable\nand predictable film. Undoubtedly\nMadonna will get some bad press for\nthis film, and none of the rest of the\ncast deserve to receive an oscar for\ntheir performances.\nHowever, despite all this I did find\nmyself laughing out loud on a lot of\noccasions, and if you don't expect too\nmuch, you won't be disappointed.\nWho's That Girl is fun but I just wish\nthat everybody hadn't fallen in love\nat the end.\nT.G.

PATA had two inseparable aims: to inform people about the\nnature and effects of abortion and to promote more\nconstructive options than killing the human foetus. The\nfirst aim was an essential prerequisite to the second,\nbecause unless people are fully aware of the destructive\neffects of abortion on mother and child, they are not likely\nto face the all too obvious difficulties presented by\nchildren. Whilst people continue to promote abortion as\na panacea and refuse to discuss its damaging effects, PATA members may well feel encumbered with informing people\nabout the nature of abortion.\nIt\\vas also rather disingenuous of Kemi Adenubi to\nsuggest that PATA did not place great emphasis on the\npositive ways of dealing with problem pregnancies. To\nour knowledge she has not obtained any of our literature,\nother than a single leaflet, or attended any of our meetings.\nIf she had, she would have soon discovered that one of\nour main concerns was to promote the non-directive\ncou ncel ling and other services provided by LIFE(4874776). Indeed their telephone number was prominent at\nall our stalls, and occasionally noted, if somewhat\ndiscrete ly, by young women.\nIn the face of somewhat simplistic treatment of the\ndifficulties involved in abortion, we have tried to present\na complete and honest picture of the alternatives available\nto someone faced with a problem pregnancy. I hope that\nPATA will continue to do so, and in particular that the\ncaring help and philosophy of LIFE will become more\nwidely known, perhaps through the services of FELIX. Yours faithfully,\nPaul Rice, PATA Secretary (1986/87).\nBeing with\npotential?\nDear Judith,\nKemi Adenubi tells us she is 'pro...the mother's life'\n( FELIX Oct 16). Along with a few lines explaining this\nposition the rest other article lambasts Imperial College's Positive Alternatives to Abortion Society and makes the\ntentative suggestion that were the enormous abortion\nfigures broken down into particular categories they might\nbecome much more acceptable to us all.\nI do think, personally, that the key to all these issues\nlies basically in deciding whether or not the foetus is a member of the human species and whether or not one ever\nhas the right to directly cause the end of the life of such\na member. Ms Adenubi's few lines with regard to this\narea tell us '...every fertilised egg is a potential human\nbeing. The woman is an actuality, a human being who\nhas been existing independent other mother's womb for\nquite some time' and that pregnancy 'wreaks major\nchanges in her body and life especially on her standing\nin society' and thus that she has the 'right' to choose 'safe'\nabortion'.\nWhat kind of science is in use in suggesting that the\nfoetus is a 'potential human being' rather than a human\nbeing with potential? What concept of 'rights' is in use\nthat makes 'independence' a clinching factor? What type\nof 'society' are we supporting that allows one section to\ndecide that they have the right to step on another to further\ntheir progress? What are we doing to a woman undergoing\n'major changes in her body', in the inherently natural\npreparation for motherhood, in supporting ri ping into this\nprocess? Is all this really 'safe'?\nIf we believe in 'rights' and compassion and want to\nexercise them I do think we should be a bit careful and\nask some of these questions. I too, I would note, am 'pro'\nthe mother's life.\nYours sincerely,\nHugh MacKenzie, Civ Eng RA\nPositive\nAlternatives\nDear Judith,\nIn reply to the opinion article 'What Positive\nAlternatives?' ( FELIX Oct 16) I would like to ask Kemi\nwhy, if she is concerned about abortion issues, she hasn't attended any of PAT A's meetings? If she had, she would\nhave discovered that PATA, although predominantly male\n(which reflects upon IC) has a higher proportion of female\nmembers than IC\u201416%. However, abortion affects both\nmen and women so the relevance of the ratio of male to\nfemale members of PATA seems small to me. Further,\nour first talk given by Pat Gallagher (a Life/SPLC\nmember) on October 15 this year, entitled 'Positive\nAlternatives to Abortion', answered several points that\nKemi voiced.\nKemi and anyone else are most welcome to come along\nto PAT A's meetings and voice any positive criticisms or\nideas as we are always willing to hear them.\nYours sincerely,\nRachel Dowling (Secretary of PATA).\nSilly letter\nDear Judith,\nHave any of your readers noticed the remarkable\nsimilarity between ICU President Ian Howgate and Zippy\nfrom 'Rainbow'.\nYours sincerely,\nRainbow Fan.\nFELIX Friday October 30th198723 "

    "content": "i_i r Selective\nwins the\nprize\nThis year's prize is shared between\nthree people for their work on some\ncompounds that are very fussy about.\nwhat other sorts of molecules they\nassociate with. These compounds are\nuseful because they can be used to\nselectively encourage certain difficult\nreactions and they can be used to\ndiscriminate, and therefore separate,\ncertain very similar metals in\nsolution. The three people who got\nthe prize are: Charles Pedersen (who\nworked for DuPont central research\nlabs in Delaware); Donald Cram\n(University of California at Los\nAngeles); and Jean-Marie Lehn (who\nis French).\nThe story started when Pedersen\nwas trying to make some industrially\nuseful chemical. Because of some\ngunk in his starting materials, he\nproduced (as well as what he wanted)\na small yield of crystalline impurity\nwith unusual properties. Most people\nwould have thrown the annoying side-product away, and used purer starting\nmaterials next time, but most people\ndon't win Nobel prizes. Pedersen was\na curious man and he investigated the\nstrange new compound. It turned out\nto be a compound now called di b enzo(18) crown-6 which has some strange\nproperties.\nThe structure of the compound is\nthe key to its strange behaviour. Once\nPedersen had realised what the\nstructure was, he was able to design\nmore similar compounds to perform\ndifferent chemical roles. Cram was a consultant for DuPont at the time, and\nhe realised that the compounds could\nbe used to do some very selective\nreactions.\nThe simplest of the compounds are\nrings containing CH2 groups and\nsome oxygen s.(18) crown-6 has an\n18-membered ring with 12 CH2\ngroups and 6 oxygen s, hence the\nname. The compounds are called\ncrown ether s because, in their three-dimensional structures, they often\nlook like the things royalty put on\ntheir heads. More complex versions\nof the compounds were devised by\nLehn which contain nitrogen s and can\ntherefore have three interlocking rings\nseduction\nchemistry\n(this creates a cavity more like a glove\nthan a ring). These compounds are\ncalled crypt and s and hold on to metal\nions even more tightly than the crown\nether s. Even more complex\ncompounds have been devised since\nwith structures that have to be seen\nto be believed.\nAdulterous but fussy molecules\nThe unusual chemical properties of\nthe compounds result from their\nadulterous (but non-promiscuous)\nrelationships with certain charged\nions and molecules in solution. They\nare able to seduce other specific\nmolecules away from their rightful\nspouses and encourage them to set up\nnew homes in solution.\nNormally in chemistry it is difficult\nto coax charged things into solution\nin neutral inert solvents. The trouble\nis that ions in solids such as common\nsalt (consisting of Na+ and C1) are\nhappily married, and need some very\nstrong attract ant to get them to split\nup (they need something attracted to\nthem more strongly than they are\nattracted to the crystal lattice). Water\ncan dissolve some salt because the\nhighly dipolar water molecules are\nstrongly attracted to the ions and can\ntherefore crowd round them and\nattract them out of the crystal lattice.\nLess polar solvents have great\ndifficulty in attracting the ions from\nthe lattice, so you can't get salt to\ndissolve in benzene (which has no\ndipole to keep the ions happy). Most\ncommon organic solvents have this\nproblem, which is a pain because in\nsome compounds that are not soluble\nin water.\nIn organic solvents the rule is like'\ndissolves li k fe, so compounds that are\nmostly carbons and hydrogens will\ndissolve in solvents that are mos dy carbons and hydrogens. This is why\ncrown ether s are so useful. Inside the\nring they are adulterous ly attractive\nto things like potassium ions (because\nof the dipoles caused by the presence\nof oxygen s on the ring) but on the\noutside they just look like any old\nhydrocarbon because all the solvent\ncan see is the CH2 groups. So it is\npossible to sneak ionic species into\npreviously inaccessible places.\nBut the particular quality of crown\nether s that is useful is their selectivity.\nThe size of the hole decides which\nions fit inside. And, when something\nfits, it fits really tightly: for example,\npotassium ions just cannot resist\n18-crown-6. In an organic solvent in\ncontact with a salt, so many\npotassium s are lured from the crystals\nthat the previous spouses (counter\nions in chemical jargon) of the\npotassium ions will also come into\nsolution in a futile attempt to regain\ntheir lost loves, so the crystals will\ndissolve.\nThe forsaken loves of the potassium\nions can be put to good use. For\n0^ ^ 0\n(18)crown-6\nPotassium ions can't resist its\nembrace\nDibenzo(18)crown-6\nThe first crown ether to be\ndiscovered\n2-2-2 crypt and \u2014fits like a glove\n\u2022example, the permanganate ions\n(Mn04 - ) from potassium\npermanganate or the hydroxide ions\nfrom potassium hydroxide, will\nwander naked searching for their lost\nloves in non-polar solutions\ncontaining 18-crown-6. These ions\nare agitated enough to participate in\nreactions that cannot normally be\ndone in such solutions.\nBut crown ether s are very fussy.\nSolutions of mixed ions can be\nseparated by the use of a crown ether\nthat complexes only one component\nin the mixture. 15-crown-6 will cling\nto sodium ions for dear life but will\ntend to leave potassium ions alone\n(they are slightly too large to fit in the\nhole, but otherwise they are very\nsimilar to sodium ions). This can be\nvery useful industrially in the\nseparation of mixtures of similar ions.\nExtremely fussy molecules\nCompounds similar to crown ether s have become increasingly important\nin the years since the compounds were\ni first noticed. Their cavities have been\nIdesigned to seduce many different\ntypes of compound. Work involving\nImperial College, Sheffield\nUniversity and ICI has shown how\npara qu at( the compound that kills\nweeds when you put it on your\ngarden, but kills people when you\nstore it in lemonade bottles) can be\nheld in the cavity of b is para phenyl ene(34) crown-10 (there\nwill hopefully be a report on this work\nin FELIX soon). The holes inside\nsome of the compounds have been\ndesigned to take only one mirror\nimage of some reacting molecules,\nthereby promoting reactions of only\none isomer giving biologically useful\nproducts (when molecules can be\neither left- or right-handed, nature\nalways sticks with just one hand).\nThis is very useful in the drug\nindustry where, for many drugs, only\none optical isomer is active (for\nexample, only one of the two isomers\nof dopamine, the compound used to\ntreat Parkinson's Disease, is useful.\nIn building molecules with such\nabilities to discriminate between other\nsimilar molecules, chemists are\nbeginning to learn how to mim mick nature. Enzymes (nature's chemical\ncompanies) can tell the difference\nbetween very_ similar molecules and\ncan produce products containing\nmolecules of only one handedness. It\nwould make some important\nchemicals a lot cheaper if we could\ncopy nature's methods.\nWe should never forget that none\nof this chemistry would have been\ndone if a single chemist had not been\ncurious. So curiosity may sometimes\nkill the cat, but it feeds the chemist.\nFELIX Friday October 30th19879 "

    "content": "News Feature Cess Pools and Steam Rollers\n\u2022The Fifth ColumnThe pursuit of engineering excellence and the desire to make a quick buck\nhas prompted some wie rd and wonderful innovations over the years. Who,\nfor instance can fail to be impressed by 'captain Nortons frictional shell'\nor 'Johnson's improved machinery for emptying cesspools'? 'They don't make them like that anymore'\u2014more's the pity.\nIn the following article, the Fifth Column takes a look at some of the\npotential inventions from the past, which for one reason or another didn't quite make it. The text (for the most part) and diagrams are genuine\nreproductions from engineering magazines printed at the turn of the\ncentury. Read on...\nRevolutionary weapon\nA REMARKABLE new weapon has\nbeen patented by researcher Captain\nNorton. The frictional shell is likely\nto have applications in blasting, house\ndefence, and submarine explosions.\nThe device is constructed from an\nordinary wine or soda bottle, filled\nwith gunpowder.\nRolling along\nBY SLIPPING 24-in wide butt-welded tires of Vi in, thick steel over\nthe regular wheels of a paving mixer,\nmade by the Chain Belt Company, a contractor for road construction in\nGlenwood, Iowa, converted the mixer\ninto a road roller at a cost of $75. This\nremarkable idea allowed the firm to\n.roll and mix at the same time.\nJointed ship tames the waves\nr \u2014iMACS WE NEY S revolutionary\ndesign for a jointed ship will set new\nstandards in maritime speed and\nsafety. The vessel, consisting of a series of hinged sections is capable of\nrising over waves instead of going\nthrough them and will thus be able to\nreach hitherto unattainable speeds.\nThe segments can be readily\ndisconnected in the event of an\naccident so that the undamaged parts\nof the ship can remain afloat allowing\nlives and cargo to be saved.\nThe inventor claims that one engine\nmodule will be sufficient to operate\nthree ships.

The machine, which\ncan cut through chalk and other soft\nrocks, is powered by high pressure\nwater and disposes of waste materials\nby generating a sludge which can be\npumped to the surface. It is claimed\nthat the system is not only quicker\nthan conventional systems, but that it\nrequires only one third of the power.\nThe machine employs a hydraulic\nmotor to drive the cutting heads, as\nshown in the accompanying etching.\nThe debris is thrown by a series of\ncups into a cylindrical revolving drum\nwhich reduces it into a sludge. When\nit is of the required constitution the\nsludge can escape through a metal\ngrill from whence it can be pumped\nto the surface.\nBill Goodwin\n6 Friday October 30th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Over 50\npeople turned up to train with Mr Hazard and benefit from his unique\nbrand of teaching.\nThe lesson was split into two\nparts\u2014the first catering mainly for\nbeginners, while the second half of\nthe lesson was for advanced students.\nThe session started with the basic\nmoves fundamental to karate; proper\nexecution of punches, kicks and\nblocks were taught and these were\nthen applied during sparring. The\nadvanced class consisted of combinations of punches, kicks and\nblocks, with much importance being\nplaced on speed and power.\nThroughout the lesson Sensei\nHazard stressed the need to develop\na good martial spirit, and great\nemphasis was placed on 'Kime' or\nfocus. The evening ended with a series of hard hitting strikes and\nblocks being exchanged between\nA Plain Man's Guide to\nHigh Energy Physics\n(Get rid of as many elements as you can!)\nIn particle physics we try to reduce\nthe number of elements as far as\npossible.\nEarlier in the century, when we\nwere first discovering the elements\nof matter, electrons and protons\nwere just about all we knew.\nSince then, to say the least, the\nnumber of known particles has\nincreased drastically.\nWith the introduction of quarks\nand gluons we have attempted to\n\"This is eternal life: that they may know you\nthe only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom\nyou have sent\" John 17:3\nmake the subject manageable.\nBut at every level of physics God\ndemonstrates his greatness; we will\nnever really understand nature.\nIn man's search for God - what\nwe call religion - we are in a similar\ndilemma. God is so great that we\nwill never discover what he is like\nby our own efforts.\nIn Jesus, God reaches out to us\nso that the number of elements is\nreduced from infinity to one.\nA series of events in week eight, Nov2328 organised by Imperial College Christian Union Sensei Hazard and Sensei Caesar\nAndrews the Club's regular\ninstructor. Sensei Hazard has had a long and distinguished career in Karate and runs his own club in Brighton. After the lesson he took\ntime to discuss some of his views on\nkarate.\nA strong believer in traditional\nkarate, he stresses that without history\nand tradition there is no karate.\nAlthough Sensei Hazard praises those\nwho practice karate solely as a sport\nand admires their athletic activity, he\nmaintains that those who show a good\nbalance between fighting, Kata (pre-set moves against imaginary\nopponents) and basics will be strong\nin karate for life. Above all, Sensei\nHazard believes that the quality of the\nkarate performed depends upon the\npractitioner and his enthusiasm.\nWhen asked what karate meant to\nhim, Sensei Hazard replied simply\n'Karate is my life. It is the vehicle I use to live.' Throughout the evening\nDave Hazard endeared himself to his\nstudents with his combination of skill\nand sense of humour, making it a pleasure to train under him.\nFor more information about the\nKarate Club contact the Captain,\nMaurice Patel (Geol III) or come to\nany training session (see the What's On page).

    "content": "THE\nHIGH\nGROUND\nSatellite\ntechnology has\ngiven a new\ntwist to the\narms race. Spies\nin the sky\nincreasingly\ndictate nuclear\nstrategy. Dave\nBurns takes a look at the race\nto control the\nFinal Frontier.\nNothing New\nOne of the major principles of warfare\nthrough the ages has been one tactical\nadvantage of possession of the higher\nground. Once the space race had\ncommenced in the fifties, it soon\nbecame apparent that the ability to\nplace satellites in orbit around the\nEarth gave those nations with such\nadvanced technology the use of the\nultimate in high ground. It was\ninevitable that the arms race would\nspread into space.\nSince 1958 more than 2200\nsatellites with actual or potential\nmilitary uses have been launched.\nOnce launched, the satellite itself\nbecomes a target, leading directly to\nthe development of anti-satellite\nweapons. In turn these anti-satellite\nweapons have immediately\ncomplicated the arms negotiation\nsituation by becoming potential anti-ballistic missile systems.\nSome 75% of all satellites are\nlaunched for military purposes. The\nlaunch rates for both the US and the\nSoviet Union have become constant\nover the last few years, indicating that\nthe two super powers now have as\nmuch satellite capability as they\nrequire. What then are the uses of\nthese satellites, and what are the\nprospects for future military\nexpansion into the final frontier?\nNuclear Strategy\nAdvances in space technology have\nincluded improvements in space based\nsensors for surveillance,\ncommunications, command and\ncontrol system, and space based\nnavigation aids to enhance the\nac curacies of delivery systems for\nboth conventional and nuclear\nweapons systems. Such advances\nhave led to changes in tactical\ndoctrines for nuclear war. Over past\ndecades nuclear doctrine evolved\nfrom the idea of Mutually Assured\nDestruction, the infamous MAD policy.\nThis has now been transformed into\nthe flexible response strategy which\nallows for the maintenance of MAD, as well as the ability to counter attack\nwith 'flexible, controlled use of\nstrategic weapons against appropriate\ntargets for any attack at any level of\nconflict'. This is known as the\nCountervailing Strategy, and is born\nout of the high ac curacies of weapons,\nthe precise knowledge of targets, and\nincreased warning of attack made\npossible by military systems in space.\nThe flexible response doctrine\nrequires good command,\ncommunication, control and\nintelligence (C3\nI) systems. The way\nin which satellites fulfil these roles is\ndiscussed below.\nReconnaissance\nThe US budget for reconnaissance\nand surveillance from space was\nthought to be about \u00a31.3 billion in\n1986. The importance of eyes in the\nsky is enormous. The genre started\nwith the US Air Force Big Bird\nsatellites. These high resolution\nphotographic recon na is ance satellites\nhave orbital lifetimes of up to 180\ndays. More recent KH-11 satellites of\nthe US have lifetimes of up to 1166\ndays. With the vast array of\nrecon na is ance satellites in orbit, the\ntime intervals between observations\nof a point on Earth can be drastically\nreduced. The general pattern now is\nthat Big Bird satellites are sent up to\ninvestigate areas indicated to be of\nparticular interest by the KH-11\nsatellites. Photographic satellite\nreconnaissance can reveal troop\nmovements, military installations,\neven new designs of Soviet Aircraft.\nIn contrast the Soviet Union have\nrelatively few long lived\nreconnaissance satellites, most have\na life of about 14 days.\nWhile much is known about\nphotographic satellites, comparatively\nlittle is known about current\nelectronic reconnaissance. These\nsatellites are designed to be military\nears in space. They monitor radio\nsignals generated by the other side's military activity throughout the\nworld. This covers everything from\nmilitary communications between\nbases, early warning radars, air\ndefence and missile radars to missile\ntesting, new radars, in short, all types\nof electromagnetic emission. Here,\nthe source of signals can be located\nby navigation satellites, using\nmethods resembling hyperbolic\nnavigation in reverse. Instead of using\nfour transmitters on four satellites to\nlocate an object, four receivers on\nfour satellites can locate the position\nof an unknown transmitter on Earth.\nOcean Surveillance\nAnother element of C3\nI is the use of\nocean surveillance and oceanographic\nsatellites. Ocean surveillance satellites\nare used to track naval movements,\nwhile oceanographic satellites are of\nenormous help in increasing\nunderstanding of various ocean\nproperties, knowledge which is\ninvaluable in anti-submarine warfare.\nOcean satellites also have a subsidiary\nfunction in detecting ocean launched\nmissiles.\nExplosion Detection\nThe USA has launched satellites for\nthe specific detection of nuclear\nexplosions in the atmosphere and in\nouter space. It is now intended that\nthe NAV STAR location system will\ncarry sensors of the Integrated\nOperational Nuclear Detection\nSystem (IONDS) to provide damage\nassessment both within\" ones own\ncountry and within enemy territory\nduring and after a nuclear attack. This\nis designed to enhance the early\nwarning, size assessment and data on\nattacked targets in order to give\ngreater flexibility of response.\n12 Friday October 30th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Second-class\nuniversities would provide some\ngeneral teaching and limited research,\nwhile only undergraduate and some\nMSc courses would be offered by\nthird-class universities.\nThe Committee, while accepting\nthat a concentration of resources was\nnecessary to maintain the international\nstanding of British research, felt that\nscientists would be deprived of the\nfreedom the present system provides.\nIt was also considered that some\nstudents would lose the benefits of\neducation in a research environment.\nClubs sponsorship go ahead\nIC Union clubs who gain extra money from sponsorship by outside bodies\nwill be able to keep all of that money for themselves, it was decided at\nUnion Finance Commitee (UFC) last night.

    "content": "FELIX OPINION\nSpiritual matters\nWorking late one evening a PhD\nstudent broke an expensive part of\nsome equipment he was using. The\ndamage wasn't obvious and he left the\nmachine as if nothing had happened.\nHe arrived in some trepidation the\nnext day ready to explain the matter\nto his supervisor. However, a colleague had come in early, started\nto use this same machine, and on\ndiscovering it was broken had\nconsidered herself responsible. The\nsupervisor was furious with her\nbecause of the expense and delay\ninvolved in repairing the result of\ncareless stupidity, as he saw it. On\nfinding he was unsuspected, the real\nculprit let things lie.\nDoes it go without saying that he\nought to have owned up? In 'Soul\nSearching' (FELIX 780) RG Fincher\nseems inclined to dismiss the\nexistence of human soul. In later\nweek's FELIX Steve Black and David\nAshforth suggest that our soul is\nencoded entirely in the molecular\ncomposition of our brains. I consider\nhere that the 'ought' in our decision\nmaking carries implications of a supernatural basis for firstly our free\nwill and secondly for the origin of\nwhat is right or wrong in our\nactions\u2014both of which are related to\nthe soul (or spirit) and to what it is\nto be human.\nWhat is going on in the mind when\nwe make a moral decision?\nPsychologically and neurologic ally the mind is very complex, but\nfundamentally it is not. The physics\nand chemistry of the mind must be\npresumed to involve the ordinary stuff\nof protons, neutrons and electrons\nengaged in attractive and repulsive\nforces, clumped together, spinning,\nvibrating, smashing into one another\nand rearranging (not to put it too\ntechnically!). At any instance in time\nduring the making of a decision, the\nmind will have a given physical\narrangement. An instant later there is\na new arrangement, as the decision\nprogresses. What links the two states\nin time? Suppose the link is entirely\na cause-effect circle, such that any one\nphysical state of the mind is wholly\ndependent upon the previous state and i wholly the cause of the next, then the\nprogression of the decision-making\nprocess is an inevitable consequence'\nof the first state. This could be traced\nback to our conception. What we are\nnow would have to be an inevitable\nconsequence of what we were at our\nconception, as shaped by interaction\nwith our environment. Our environment\u2014including other people\nand the expressions of their minds,\nsuch as conversation, books,\ntelevision, music, etc\u2014would also be\ncompletely determined by its physics\nand chemistry. We must remember\nthat all the higher level descriptions\nof human behaviour, such as\nintelligence theory, psychology and\nsociology, ride on the back of the\nunderlying physics and chemistry\nwhich expresses them; fundamentally\nthey are controlled, not controlling.\nIf, then, only cause-effect (and\npossibly also random) processes are\nat work in the physical universe, there\ncan be no free will. Give up your seat\non a bus for an old lady\u2014inevitable\n(or random); marry Jane rather than\nJan or Joan\u2014inevitable; let a colleague in your lab carry the can for\nsomething you have done\u2014inevitable.\nNo blame, no praise, is attributable\nto any action. This, however, does\nnot tally with our experience of what\nis human at its highest level, or indeed\nthe way any of us live. At the centre\nof what is human, or personal if you\nlike, we seem to exercise a supernatural control within our minds\nover their purely physical nature. This\nsupernatural element is without prior\ncause (it is baseless assumption of our\n'scientific' age that everything has a cause), it stands alone as an origin of\ncause and is in essence what we are.\nWe are, then, determining and\nresponsible, rather than determined.\nIn this sense we are like God.\nIt is because of this supernatural\nfree will that we are ready to blame\nothers for what they do\u2014they are\nresponsible. The student who dropped\nhis lab partner in it, had the ability\nfreely to choose to own up. He ought\nto have owned up. But here is a second problem, why ought he to\nhave owned up? What possible reason\ncould one give him? I can think of\nnone. One might tell him that he\nwouldn't like the same done to him.\nTrue, but so what?\u2014it constitutes no\nreason for not allowing it to happen\nto someone else. You might tell him\nthat it is for the good of society that\npeople behave truthfully and decently\ntoward one another. He could very\nreasonably reply, 'stuff society'. That\nwhich we feel we ought to do is very\neasily squeezed out of existence\nbetween the self interest of our reason\nand our free will! If we do anything\nof benefit to others it need only be out\nof self interest, perhaps so that they\nwill like us and reciprocate.\nYet in practice that is a very cynical\nview. The world is full of people who\ndo selfless acts as if there were some\nindependent goodness which stood\nwithout reference to themselves or\nothers, but which they endorse. We\noften behave as though there were a way in which we ought to live, and\nyet we o an find no reason why it is\nright. I believe this Tightness to be\nGod's will, God's love, part of who\nGod is. It doesn't enlarge our ego to\nperceive that any good which we do\nis only a response to God's will for\nus, all the glory passes to him. That\nmight go sq me way to explaining why\nso many people are not too happy\nwith this line of argument, and are\nprepared to go on holding\ninconsistently to a set of principles\nwhich they can in no way validate.\nThere is nothing behind God. Goodness originates in God's nature.\nThe very possibility of the idea of\ncreation is in God. In his personal free\nwill he has formed a universe with\ncausal physical structure so that our\nactions are not empty but have real\nconsequence, in favour of or against\nhis goodness. He-himself lives as a man in Jesus. Jesus declared, 'I and\nthe Father are one', and some of the\nJews took up stones to kill him for\nblasphemy saying 'although you are\na man you claim to be God' (John Ch\n10). Jesus' disarming defence was to\nquote from the Old Testament 'I( God) say, 'you are gods\"\u2014God can\nlive as a man because every man is\nlike God in having freewill, in being\nand originator of cause.\nOur supernatural free-will\nresponsibility to do what is right is\nfundamental to Christian belief, as is\nour failure to do it. Also fundamental\nis the substitutionary bearing of the\ncq n sequences of our failure by Christ\nin his death on the cross, and his\nres sure c tion to life as a demonstration\nof God's power to give us new life\nafter our death.\nP Baker.\n\u2022 Kicking off the week on the Beeb\nthere is a second chance to see the\nfinal part of the Biography of George\nBalanchine (BBC2, Sat 7.25pm), founder of the New York Classical\nBallet, and.arguably the greatest\nchoreographer to have ever worked\nin the States.

It was only after the boat had\npassed the body that they realised\nshe was in fact drowning.

    "content": "1\n% *\n*\n\"\n\u2022\nFeature Communications\nCommunications satellites form only\npart of the elaborate defence\ncommunications systems of the\nmilitary. However, the US is placing\ngreater emphasis on satellite\ncommunications, particularly with\nnuclear forces. The existing space\ncomponent in the US communications\nsystem consists of transponders\naboard satellites such as the Fleet\nSatellite Communications satellites\n( F LTS AT COM), as well as other\nsatellites in polar orbits.\nSince satellites are becoming an\nessential part of C3\nI, it has become\nimportant to make them sur viv able. The US Air force has proposed a satellite for this specific purpose,\ncalled STRATS AT, which would\norbit at an altitude of about 203 720\nkm in order to increase its\nsur viv ability. It would also include\nextra resistance to jamming, and amano eu ve ring ability. Although the\nsatellite itself may become more\nresistant to attack its ground facilities\nremain as vulnerable. It is also worthy\nof note that all the satellites electrical\nsystems are vulnerable to nuclear\nattack even without a direct hit. Pulses\nof neutrons and gamma rays seriously\naffect semi-conductor devices. It is\nbecause of this that strenuous efforts\nare being made to harden both the\nground and space elements of C3\nI against nuclear attack.\nAnti-Satellite Systems ASAT\nWith so much time and effort being\ndevoted to protecting one's own\nsatellites, it is hardly surprising that\nan equal amount of time is being spent\ndetermining how to destroy the\nopposition's satellites.\nThe Soviet Union's efforts in this\ndirection centre around the less than\nsubtle approach of having a satellite\nmove alongside its target, before\nblowing up. This method suffers from\nbeing a costly and strictly once only\nusage of a satellite. It does have the\nadvantage of being very difficult to\ndetect. It is almost impossible to know\nif a satellite is, in effect, a mine until\nit's too late.\nThe US takes a more direct\napproach with its anti-satellite\nweapons, relying on miniature\nhoming vehicles launched on a missile\nfrom high altitude, about 20km. It can\nbe used as a direct ascent system\nagainst any satellite in any orbital\ninclination and this combined with its\nsmall size makes it very sur viv able. Initial trials with the system from an\nF15 fighter have achieved reasonable\nresults.\nChernobyl reactor complex as photographed by Landsat 5.\nAbove\u2014Hot water in ponds before disaster.\nBelow\u2014After reactors shut down.\nRecent Developments\nThe 1983 Korean Airline incident was\nlinked to US satellite activity over the\narea at the same time. The US electronic reconnaissance satellite\n1982-41C was over the Kamchatka\nPeninsula at the same time as the\nairliner entered Soviet airspace. It has\nbeen suggested, more frequently by\nthe Soviets, that the whole incident\nwas an exercise by the US to monitor\nSoviet reactions.\nSoviet ocean satellite launches have\nincreased their knowledge of the polar\nice cap and this has led directly to the\nSoviet Union developing the\ncapability to launch submarine\nlaunched ballistic missiles through the\nArctic ice cap.\nThe Soviet Union has also tried to\nincrease the duration of flight for its\nreconnaissance satellites. They had\nbeen experiencing problems with\nsatellite recovery, but are now using\ndigital image transmission to\novercome this.\nSpace Weapons\nThe strategic importance of satellites\nhas spurred-on research into even\nmore elaborate methods of destroying\nthem. This has burgeoned into the socalled Star Wars system, the intent\nbeing to place weapons in space to\ndeprive the opposition of the high\nground. Huge amounts of expenditure\nis now being devoted to this aim by\nboth super powers. Current space\nweapons can be divided into two\ngroups, kinetic energy and directed-energy weapons. KE weapons derive\ntheir destructive energy from the\nmomentum of a propelled object. In\ndirected energy weapons, energy in\nthe form of electromagnetic beams or\nparticle beams is the destructive\nelement.\nKinetic Energy\nTwo types of KE weapon are being\ninvestigated\u2014the so called mass\ndriver and the electromagnetic rail\ngun. The mass driver was first\nproposed as early as 1966. A travelling electromagnetic wave is\nused to accelerate a mass which is\npreferable ferromagnetic or superconducting. The mass is\naccelerated through a series of coils\nwhile held in magnetic levitation. The\ngreatest disadvantage is the\ncomparatively modest accelerations\nproduced at each step. Currently, to\naccelerate a mass of 0. lg to 150 km/s would require a2 km accelerator.\nThe more promising device is\ncalled the rail gun. A current is\nallowed to flow down two rails, with\na partially conducting armature placed\nperpendicular ly across the rails. The\nprojectile is placed in front of this.\nHowever, the mass of the armature\nlimits the acceleration. This has been\novercome by using a plasma, caused\nby electrical discharge between the\nrails, as the armature. Various more\ncomplex methods of increasing the\nefficiency of these weapons are under\ninvestigation. However, none of these\nweapons have the immediate prospect\nof becoming space based, and their\nextreme cost has directed the major\nspace weapon efforts in the field of\nbeam weapons.\nDirected-Energy Weapons\nIn the field of directed-energy\nweapons, laser beam weapons are\nholding centre stage.\nAmong chemical lasers, the\nchemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL)\nseems suitable as a weapon. The\nCOIL transmits at wavelengths of\n1.3 m. In such a laser, energy is\ntransferred from excited oxygen\nmolecules produced by a chemical\nreaction. Its main advantage is that\neasily handled liquid fuel can be used.\nPlans to build a50 kW COIL are\nunderway.\nX ray lasers make a very attractive\nspace weapon prospect because of\ntheir short wavelength. Two major\nproblems complicate their\napplication. A considerable amount of\nenergy has to be used to raise the\nenergy levels in the atom. Second, the\nprobability of stimulated emission\ndecreases sharply as the wavelength\nof radiation decreases.\nA further complication is that the\nlifetime of excited states is\nproportional to the wavelength\nsquared. This means that atoms would\nstay in the excited state for as little\nas 10_13S. The necessary conditions\ncan best be created by use of a powerful pulse of x rays generated\nfrom a nuclear explosion.\nClearly once again, this is a once\nonly use weapon. The problems of\nbeam direction and multiplicity would\nseem almost insurmountable.\nHowever, research continues.\nArms Negotiation\nThe proliferation of satellites with\ni military uses, and the consequent rush\nto develop space weapons to destroy\nthem, has produced a paradox. The\ncurrent state of military satellite\ntechnology makes verification of arms\nlimitation treaties a relatively simple\naffair. There is just nowhere to hide\nanymore. Unfortunately, the\nassociated rush to produce the socalled Star Wars systems on both\nsides has held up the very same\nprocess of arms limitation.\nI While satellites hold both the means\nto wage nuclear war and the means\ni to prevent it, there can be no easy\nsolution to the problem.\nFELIX Friday October 30th198713 "

    "content": "A Nightmare on Elm StreetPart 3 Dream Warriors\nSurprise, surprise, Freddy's back\nagain. For those unfamiliar with the\nNightmare series, Freddy Kreuger\n(Robert Englund) was a child\nmurderer who was burned alive by a group of vigilante parents and who\nsubsequently returns to terror is e their\nchildren in their dreams, complete\nwith grisly appearance and razor-tipped right hand. This time the\nunfortunate teenagers are all locked\nup. in the local asylum after they\nbecome violently fearful of sleeping.\nFortunately, a specialist in dream\ndisorders (well I didn't spot it at the\nCareers Fair) in the shape of Dr Nancy Thomson (Heather Langenkamp) arrives, and by coincidence is\nthe sole survivor of a group of\nteenagers who suffered the same fate\nback in Nightmare I. As they are\ngradually killed off, Nancy leads them\ninto a combined attack on Freddie.\nMeanwhile, the caring Dr Neil\nGoldman (Craig Wasson) is involved\nin a race to locate Freddy's earthly\nremains guided by Nancy's father\nJohn (John Saxon).\nDream Warriors sees the return of\nWes Craven, the writer of the original\nNightmare, but don't let that fool you\ninto thinking it might be good\u2014this\nlatest sequel has none of the\noriginality of the first. Despite a promising beginning (which even had\nme wincing at one point) the film\nrapidly descends into a kind of 'Five\ngo mad in Dreamland'.\nA momentary glimpse of Zsa Zsa\nGabor serves no purpose, the title\nsong by Dokken and inevitable\nsoundtrack are gimmicks which do\nnothing but highlight the incoherent\nplot and paper-thin stereotypical\nroles. I'd rather have an early night.\nA.N. Eat the Rich\nEat the Rich is the second feature to\ncome from the Comic Strip stable,\nfollowing on from the deservedly\nsuccessful Supergrass. However,\nalthough directed and co-written by\nComic Strip founder Peter\nRichardson, the usual gang (Nigel\nPlaner, Rik Mayall, Robbie\nColtrane...etc) have all been given\nminor roles, a clever move\nconsidering the amount of exposure\nthey've had elsewhere recently.\nEat the Rich is a portrayal of\nThatcher's Britain exaggerated to\nfarcical extremes, exemplified by the\nhilarious character of the Home\nSecretary, 'Nosher' Powell, an ex-heavyweight boxer, who's solution to\nalmost any problem from terrorist\nsieges to Union leaders is a sharp left\nhook; and whose opinions are\nsummed up by his statement on\ntelevision that \"some people in this\ncountry are very rich, but most of you\nare very poor. You're all lazy\nbastards.\"\nApart from Nosher the plot follows\nthe adventures of Alex, the\nhorrendously camp ex-waiter at\n'Bastards', a restaurant where Panda\nsteak is on the menu and people leave\n50 quid tips, who is now down-and-out, tramping the oppressive and\nlonely London streets. Driven to\ndesperation by a social security clerk,\nAlex decides to start a peoples'\nuprising, whereupon he becomes a victim of the machinations of\nCommander Fortune, a Russian spy\ntrying to depose Nosher. Joining up\nwith a group of three other totally\ninappropriate revolutionaries and\narmed with bows and arrows, they\ntake over 'Bastards', change the name\nto 'Eat the Rich' and start serving up\nthe customers, but are eventually\nrevealed by Fortune in an attempt to\nscandal is e Nosher.\nEat the Rich is over the top in\nalmost every way, from its rather\nobvious allegorical treatment of\nBritain today, to the pounding\nsoundtrack of Motorhead and yet it\nall seemed to fit together quite well.\nThe comedy is patchy, the plot giving\nthe impression of having been\nconstructed around a few clever ideas,\nbut some of the scenes were so fi in nyI thought it was worth getting through\nthe slower ones. What makes the film\nwork are the ridiculous characters (of\nwhich there are plenty) and who are\nall excellently portrayed; especially\nAlex (Lamar Pellay), her gang (Ron\nTarr, Jimmy Flag, Fiona Richmond)\nand of course, Nosher. Not as good\nas Supergrass, in the end, but\ndefinitely good fun. Incidentally the\nfilm is brimming with celebrities\nplaying minor roles, apart from the\nComic Strip team. See if you can spot\nany of the following: Angie Bowie,\nJools Holland, Paul McCartney,\nSandie Shaw, Koo Stark and Bill\nWyman!\nA.K.16 Friday October 30th1987 FELIX\n\n"

A game of 2 halves.\nQM C started defiantly, holding out\nwith 10 men for 15 minutes, before\nPip Peel sneaked the winner. 16 goals\nlater, jugs were offered by Paul Stott\n(4), Neil Vanderbegin (3), Pete Rick\n(3). Other scorers; Adam Thomas (2),\nPip Peel (2), Rakesh Muthoo (2), Jezz\nHolland (1).\nFirst class seconds\nIC II\u20148\nSussex\u20142\nAnother game of 2 halves, each\nlasting 45 minutes. Again, Pip Peel\nwas the opening scorer, as IC cashed\nin on early pressure. A defensive slip\n10 minutes later, let Sussex through.\nHowever, Mike Plummer, was there\nto callously chop the forward down.\nThe ensuing penalty was converted to\nequalise IC's early goal. After another\n10 minutes the scoring started. Adam\nThomas put IC back in the lead, but\nstraight from the KO Sussex\nequalise d. Again, straight from the\nKO, Adam was there again to restore\nIC's lead. The 2nd half started with\na bit of pressure from Sussex. Then\ncame the turning point in the game.\nSussex's centre forward raced\nthrough, but Russ Dark, obviously\nlacking speed chopped him down. He\ncarried on, but his shot past Simon\nHolden was cleared off the line by\nRuss straight away, IC rushed up field\nto bury Sussex, with Paul Stott\nopening his account. Eventually, 4\ngoals later, IC were 8-2 victors, with\nother goals from Paul Stott (3) and\nanother from Adam Thomas.\nFirst win\nK CH II vs IC V IC Vs managed their first win of the\nseason in a cup match against King's College Hospital ( K CH II) last\nSaturday. Missing regular\ngoalkeeper, Captain Jon Turner\nplayed in goal and looked set to keep\na clean sheet until 15 minutes before\nfull time.\nBy this time IC were 2-0 up thanks\nto two goals from Bas Basma, one in\neach half. It was a good all round\nperformance and a much needed\nvictory after a poor start to the season.\nThe final score was 2-1.\nUnlucky own-goal\nOn Saturday, IC 3rds travelled away\nto Egham to play New College's3 rd team in the cup. When we finally\narrived\u2014via 3 motorways, due to Rob\nKelly's navigation\u2014IC started well,\nbut could not convert the early\npressure into goals. New College then\ngot back into the match, but conceded\nan unlucky own-goal with about 10\nminutes to go until half-time.\nIn the second half, both teams\nstarted well and after 15 minutes,\nNew College equalise d with a spectacular curling shot. The game\nthen flowed from end to end with both\nsides going for the win. Then with 15\nminutes left, Paul Neville soc red for\nIC from a corner and Imperial\nsurvived the late pressure to hang on\nto the 2-1 win. They now play UC2 nd in the first round proper. Chris\nBurton played well in front of the\nbiggest crowd of the season (his\ngirlfriend) but man of the match was\ngoalkeeper Julian Henson with\nseveral good saves.\nFootball appeal\nWanted: Football Managers\nI am looking for someone in Mech\nEng, Elec Eng, and Civ Eng who\nis interested in putting a football\nteam together to play in an interdepartmental tournament on\nSunday mornings.\nIf the response is positive,\ngames could start by the end of\nNovember.\nPlease contact James Wilson,\nChem Eng 4, if you are interested.\nAny people who would like to play\nfootball for IC, or played in the first\nWednesday trials but have not been\npicked for a team, please sign their\nname on the Football Club notice\nboard (between the Union Bar and\nUnion Snack Bar). Our apologies for\nthe confusion and to anybody who has\nbeen left out, this has largely been due\nto the cancellation of our second trial.\nAny problems please contact any of\nthe committee through their\ndepartment pigeonholes.\nMartin Bradley (Physics III)\nAl Bamford (Elec Eng III)\nPaul Thomson (Mech Eng III)\nCROSS COUNTRY\nSelection confusion\nSo far this year the Club has had\ntwo outings. The first was at the\nOxford Polly Relays where we\nmanaged to enter two teams,\nfortunately there was a race once\nwe got there despite the storm on\nthe previous night! Everyone had a good run and finished close\ntogether in 8th and 9th places\nrespectively. There was some\nconfusion over selection but this is\nonly to be expected on the first\nouting and the performances\npromise well for the future.\nThe team were placed as follows:\nAlex Gaskell 34\nDave Knight 39\nMike Jones 63\nJohn Porter 73\nRamin Dilmaghanian 75\nRichard Hardiman 77\nGraham Messenger 92\nJohn Rowland 98\nStefan Ledin 106\nPhilip Gribbon 109\nAngus Davison 133\nJust one question, where are the\nwomen? C 'mon girls! See you on\nNovember 4 for race two of the\nLondon Colleges League in\nGuildford.\nLADIES HOCKEY\nStrong opposition\nIC vs Sussex (UAU)\nThis important match was postponed\nfrom Wednesday. Things started to\ngo wrong when the goalkeeper turned\nup an hour early, found no-one there\nso went home. The game started well\nfor IC with the ball spending most of\nits time in the oppositions half. This\ndidn't last long! Very soon Sussex\nbegan to put pressure on IC.\nAfter half time Sussex lifted their\ngame and not even a stalwart defence\nespecially from M Faldor and demon\nuse of the offside rule could stop\nSussex scoring 3 goals.\nOne consolation eo al was scored\nfrom a penalty flick from S Hodgson\nmaking the final score 1-3 to Sussex.\nUL7 a side\nImperial entered two teams for this\ncompetition, owing to the weather it\nproved to be the first serious hockey\nto be played by the ladies this season.\nSome good goals were scored by S Hodgson and P Ottway. The rest of\nthe team played with great enthusiasm\nOrganisation of the tournament left\na lot to be desired, however after a process of elimination and scoring\nwhich I still find incomprehensible,\none team came 6th( out of 24) and the\nother team was un placed.

Copies of the Bill\nwill appear in the Times (20 and 27\nNov) and the London Evening\nGazette. The readings of the Bill will\ntake place between January 30 and\nFebruary 6. The Act will come into\neffect on August 1 1988.\n/\u2022D \u00bb > TheWoridbeaters\nTHE FIRST new-style Phoenix is to\nbe published at the end of November,\nit was decided last year that Imperial\nCollege Union needed to produce an\narts and literary magazine but, due to\npoor sales of the previous annual\nissues, they decided to produce a pamphlet containing poetry, prose\nand photography five times each year.\nThe last annual issue is available from\nthe FELIX Office at 50p. ICRPeril\nA WILD story of death and\ndestruction shocked College on\nTuesday, when IC Radio's Southside\nStudio was engulfed in a small cloud\nof smoke.\nA minor fault in the studio\nheadphone amplifier was the culprit.\nA small potenti o meter burnt out and\ncaused the early di mise of the\nlunchtime show.\nThe dedicated team of IC Radio\ntechnicians soon repaired the fault,\nclosely watched by a group of\nworried, and grief-stricken DJs.\nAn IC Radio spokesman said later\n' We only lost 15 minutes of\nprogramming out of 100 hours per\nweek, and if you blow this out of\nproportion I 'll cut off your boll**ks!\nNew loss\nIT IS LIKELY that the Government's new housing benefit scheme will\nresult in losses of over \u00a32 per week\nfor IC students. Students in other\nparts of the country will be hit much\nless severely. The scheme comes into\neffect in April 1988. IC students with\nunder \u00a33000 savings will have to\ncontribute 20% of their rates bill.\nThose with \u00a33000 to \u00a36000 savings\nwill have to pay \u00a31 for every \u00a3250 or\npart thereof held. The rate at which\nthe rent section of the benefit will be\nwithdrawn with increasing savings\nwill be increased to an even higher\nlevel than the Government first\nproposed.\nBikeh\ne is t SINCE October 19 eight bicycles\nhave gone missing from College,\nmost being stolen from outside the\nScience Museum Library. Geoff\nReeves Security Chief at College\npointed out that none of the bikes had\na proper cycle lock, which are\navailable from College for \u00a316.25. It\ntakes only a few seconds for a chain\nor cable to be broken by a professional thief. Wallets are also\nbeing stolen from around College.\nCollege Security advise all students\nto be careful and not to leave bags and\njackets unattended.\nFELIX Friday October 30th19873 "

    "content": "THE NOBEL PRIZES 1987\nUNDER\\ THE MICROSCOPE\n9\nby Steve Black' This week the reports are all about the Nobel prizes for outstanding\nsmartness in Physics, Chemistry and Medicine. Even two pages is not\nenough to do justice to the work in any of these fields, so there may\nbe features on some of them later. If, for example, some kind Physicist\nwould care to do a survey of what we know about the new\nsuperconductors, it would make a wonderful feature\u2014and they would\nget their name in print. Other in-depth articles on specific topics of\ngeneral interest will be forthcoming soon.\nI'm sorry I 've gone on at such length about Chemistry, but it is\nwhat I know about: if you want your subject to fill up the space then\nbecome a contributor!\nEven if you don't want to contribute, we welcome your criticisms,\nsuggestions and ideas for things to report in this column. Send them\nto the FELIX Office or to my letter rack in the Chemistry foyer.\nThe medicine prize:\nshuffling genes\nA Japanese scientist who did his\nimportant work in Switzerland and\nwho now works in Boston won the\nmedicine prize for his work on the\nimmune system.\nSusumu Tonegawa won the prize\nfor working out the details of how the\nhuman immune system is able to\nproduce such a variety of antibodies.\nThis had been a big problem for\nimmunologist s for a long time.\nThere are only a limited number of\nchromosomes in a human gene, yet\nthe immune system seems to be able\nto create a virtually unlimited variety\nof antibodies to fight off nas ties in the\nbloodstream. Antibodies are just\nproteins and proteins are coded by the\nDNA of the genes, so the source of\nthe variety was a mystery.\nIn experiments with the antibody\ngenes in mouse cells, involving\ncomparison of cells from mice\nembryos and from mature mice,\nTonegawa was able to show that the\ngenes are 'shuffled' randomly during\ndevelopment. The shuffling produces\na vast variety of possible antibodies,\nenough to fight off most invading\nhorrors.\nThe elegant details of his\nmechanism have illuminated how it\nis possible for an apparently wasteful\nprocess to achieve useful results.\nThey also show how simple, natural\nsystems can show a staggering ability\nto adapt themselves to their\nenvironment.\nThe fastest physics\nprize on record?\nNobel prizes are supposed to go to the\nmost prestigious work in the given\nfield in the year of the award. This\nyear's Physics prize is just about the\nfirst time that that has happened:\nnormally you have to stay in the race\nfor twenty years after hitting the\njackpot before you get the prize.\nThe news only broke last\nSeptember that the superconductivity\ntemperature record had been trounced\nby Bendortz and Muller at the IBM labs in Zurich. This started the great\nbandwagon that has led to the\nrecognition of their work as one of the\nmost important new discoveries in the\nlast 50 years of Physics.\nPersistence pays off\nIBM had a big project to develop\nsuper fast computers about ten years\nago. The parts that did the work were\nbased on Josephson junctions (which\ninvolve two superconducting bits\nseparated by a sandwich of insulator\nabout 15 atoms thick). Computer\nwidget s fashioned from Josephson\njunctions are very much faster than\nthe same widget s made in\nconventional silicon. Unfortunately,\nthey only work at below about 20\nKelvin (about - 2 5 0 \u00b0 C). This means\nthat the CPU of the computer has to\nbe cooled by liquid helium. IBM gave\nup the project because it was simply\ntoo difficult to arrange to keep the\ncomputer cool at a reasonable price.\nHowever, two of IBM' s bright\nresearchers (Georg Bendortz and\nAlex Muller) maintained an interest\nin superconducting materials. As long\nago as 1979, Muller was getting\npissed off with the conventional metal\nalloys that superconductors were\nmade of. There seemed to be no way\nto increase the superconducting\ntransition temperature which was\nstuck at about 23K: no compounds\nwere superconducting above that\ntemperature. They decided to look at\nmetal oxides, which is strange since\nthey are normally insulators.\nHowever, they obviously knew what\nthey were doing, since their first\nexperiment pushed that temperature\nto 35K, the biggest jump since the\ndiscovery of superconductivity.\nThe group of compounds they\npicked (modified barium copper oxide\nceramics) proved to be an inspired\nchoice, and rapid modifications were\nmade by them and by others to push\nthe record temperature to above 90K. The work was not really a one-off\ndiscovery, but represented a deep\ninsight into solid state physics, backed\nup by years of previous work on other\nmaterials. This is why the reward is\nnot really the fastest ever: the group\nhas been working towards its goal for\nyears.\nThe important thing about the new\ncompounds is that they are\nsuperconducting at liquid nitrogen\ntemperatures. It is extremely cheap\nand easy to handle liquid nitrogen and\nthe compounds themselves are also\ncheap and easy to make (though they\nare not readily made into anything\nuseful as yet). They seem to mark an\namazing democrat is ation of high-tech\nphysics: previously only wealthy and\nwell-equipped laboratories could deal\nwith superconductors, now anybody\ncan have them.\nIt is strange that a discovery that has\ncome out of a wealthy company\nresearch lab should make it possible\nfor the impoverished universities to\nget into important research: normally\nthe company labs just make us\njealous.\nThe discovery of these new\ncompounds is likely to lead to more\nprizes soon, because nobody knows\nwhy they are superconductors. The\nfirst person to think of a good\nmechanism will deserve the next\nNobel prize.\n8 Friday October 30th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "I \u2022APPEARING IN The Baron of\nCheapskate is achieving the same\nkind of social status within College\nas Spitting Image is in the country at\nlarge. Certain members of the College\ncommunity are keen to see their name\nin print without anything nasty\nactually being said about them.\nExpect to hear soon of the exploits\nof some of the following:\nSteve Garbage, controller of Radio\nCheapskate, Ms Pippa Trout, citizen\nin charge of other citizens' happiness\n(and one time Citizens' Guide to\nCheapskate Editor), Chas PianoPlayer, citizen in charge of other\ncitizens' work, Alastair Hearless,\nstool of citizens' meetings, Iain Bore,\nBaron's yes-man who tells the rest of\nthe world what a wonderful place\nCheapskate is and Editor of WetNerk.\n\u2022 MR HOWGATE doesn't seem to\nlike FELIX very much. On hearing\nthat the contents of the gents' toilets\nhad seeped into the FELIX Print\nRoom, he was heard to utter \" Well that's not the only cr*p to be found\nin there\".\n\u2022 GUILDS PRESIDENT Dave\nTyler's brain cell has been working\novertime recently. In addition to\ntrying to persuade the Rector, Deans,\nand senior staff that 'they are human'\nand should therefore donate blood (ha\nha!) he has been complaining to\nFELIX about being called just plain\nMr Tyler. He is, as most people\nknow, a weekend action-man who\nlikes nothing more than playing\nshoot y shoot y, bang-bang with the\nOTC. As such, he should be called\nSecond Lieutenant Dave Tyler, but\nthis takes up too much space so from\nnow on Dave will be known as\nS.L.O.B. \u2014Second Lieutenant One\nBraincell.\n\u2022 MR HOWGATE has been talking\nabout Network, that awfully tedious\nImperial Public Relations exercise,\nand FELIX. Sources close to the\nPresident have told me that he has\ncompared Network with the Times and\nFELIX with the Sun. Watch out for\nnext week's page 3\u2014Ian Howgate's full frontal in the Union Bar last\nyear\u2014unless he donates \u00a35 to Rag of\ncourse.\nTHE BARON 'And furthermore', Derek was saying, 'all\nthe citizens in the Angel Gabriel's land\nof sick people are so desperate to move\nto Cheapskate that dozens of them ring\nme every day to ask for my wife's autograph'.\nDerek Dash, the Baron of Cheapskate,\nwas in the middle of his farewell speech\nat the citizens' leaving ceremony. He had\ngone through the usual 'Cheapskate is\nwonderful' part of his speech as quickly\nas possible (which was a good thing\nsince all the citizens who were leaving\nhad heard it all before at their welcoming\nceremony three years earlier) but now he was trying to prove to everyone\njust how wonderful Cheapskate was. He had been going on for hours and\nhours about how nice it was that the Cheapskate boundary was being\nextended to include Angel Gabriel's land of sick people, which was nearby.\nDerek was very pleased that Cheapskate was going to get bigger\u2014he kept\nimagining how future generations of Cheapskate people would remember\nhim as the Baron who conquered Angel Gabriel.\nThere had been lots of preparations for the expansion of Cheapskate.\nJohn Secretary had rounded up all the Baron's workers who had been\nsitting on their bums in the Surefield fortress (there were a lot of them)\nand ordered them to form lots of committees with the workers from Angel\nGabriel's land of sick people. There had been lots of meetings, lots of cups\nof coffee, and lots of arguing about who should take the minutes.\nEventually the two sides had agreed upon terms for the Cheapskate\nexpansion, and Derek thought that everything was going very well.\nUnfortunately, all the Angel Gabriel citizens were not quite as pleased\nabout being swallowed up as part of Cheapskate as Derek seemed to think\nthey were. The leader of the Angel Gabriel citizens had been elected\nbecause he had promised not to talk to the citizens at Cheapskate. All\nthe head citizens at Cheapskate were very upset that nobody wanted to\ntalk to them, but thought that it was probably very sensible of the Angel\nGabriel Head Citizen not to risk talking to Whygate. Everyone went out\nof their way to avoid talking to Whygate if at all possible, chiefly because\nthey all knew that it would be an hour or two before they could get a word\nin edgeways.\nAt the moment, Whygate was not particularly concerned about the\nCheapskate expansion, or even about the fact the t nobody wanted to talk\nto him. For the past two weeks he had spent nearly all his time studying\nthe Financial Times and pretending that he knew all about the stock market.\nHe was already planning to invest a hundred thousand pounds of the\nmoney from Gravlington rocks; half in a company which had just developed\nan insoluble suppository and half in Halifax Town Football Club. Whygate\nknew when he was on to a good thing!\nMeanwhile, in another part of Cheapskate, Dave Braincell, one of\nCheapskate's three clowns and the leader of the lumps of metal\nworshippers, was explaining to his new deputy how to do her job. His\nnew deputy was called Tanya Grope, and she had won her election for\nthe simple reason that she was a female citizen. Whenever a female citizen\nstood for election as a leader of the lumps of metal worshippers she was\nalways sure to win. This was because all the citizens were desperately\nsex starved, and seemed to think that voting for a female citizen would\nimpress the other female citizens. As well as being sex-starved, the lumps\nof metal worshippers were very thick\nHow many lumps of metal worshippers does it take to change a light\nbulb?\nHow is Dave Braincell getting on with Tanya Grope?\nWill the Baron be struck down by Angel Gabriel?\nWill Takeiteasy appear in the citizen's office this week?\nFind out in the next episode of 'The Baron of Cheapskate'.\nLib>el \u2022 CHARLES 'TAKE-IT-EASY'\nJACKSON, Union Hon Sec seems to\nhave been responsible for adding\nsome flavour to the Union Bar cellar\nearlier this week.\nWhile being overly helpful one\nevening tapping a barrel of Royal\nOak, he decided to remove a core\nplug in the barrel by hitting it with\na screwdriver. The beer being quite\nold had developed some pressure. The\nsudden release of gas caused a geyser\nJ of beer, hops and yeast spraying all\ni over the ceiling and walls of the\nrecently cleaned cellar. Takeiteasy\nran away 'to collect his coat'. With\nhis wet weather gear a done d, he\nbraved the gusting barrel, and put a new plug in the barrel. Mr Jackson\nI said 'it was quite funny'.\n\u2022 IT'S TIME TO START\nspeculating who's going to stand for\nthe top three Union posts next term.\nSeveral candidates have been\npractising their handshakes and baby\nkissing. The strong contenders for\nICU President include the incredibly\nawful Alistair Seymour who has been\nmost notable for his streak around the\nAlbert Hall and Alistair Birch who,\nafter having External Affairs whisked\naway from him, has turned his sights\nto Internal Affairs instead. My name\nhas also been mentioned in closed\ncircles as a potential candidate. I 'll\nhave to see what my personal tutor\nhas to say about that one. Not many\nmugs would do Deputy President\nespecially having to follow in the\nsteps of Peirce and Rose, it's odds on\nthat Pub Board Stool Chris Martin\nwill finally take the plunge after six\nyears of um ming and ar ring. Only\ndorks stand for Hon Sec. There seems\nto be a lot around the Union at the\nmoment so that post should be hotly\ncontested.\nChris Jones\nN \u2022THERE HAS BEEN a serious leak\nfrom Silwood Park. The Weed\nScience Department have made a significant break-through in managing\nto create a weed with human\ncharacteristics which has escaped to\nSouth Kensington. It has taken up\nresidence in the Deputy President's office. The weed is believed to be a strain of the Rose family and must not\nbe approached without suitable\nprecautions being taken. Pest\nmanagement and the spraying\nlaboratory are urgently looking into\nthe matter.\nFELIX Friday October 30th19877 "
