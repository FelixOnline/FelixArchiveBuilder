    "content": "AIDS: The nightmare\nIn recent weeks, one subject which\nappeared to have faded from\nprominence has been brought to light\nagain by a campaign of posters,\nleaflets and TV and radio\ncommercials released by the\ngovernment, and by a renewed burst\nof speculation on the part of the\nnational press. That subject is AIDS.\nAIDS has been variously described\nas \"The killer disease', 'The Gay\nplague', or 'the body's reaction to\nsomething unnatural'.\nAre these fair descriptions ?.\nWe have heard that you can catch\nit by shaking hands, and that because\nof it, 80% of homosexuals should be\ngassed. Is this really sensible?\nThis week, FELIX sets out to\nexamine the disease, and to clarify the\nfacts.\nThe history\nAIDS in itself causes only a mild\ncondition of lymph gland\nenlargement, but it destroys the\nbody's ability to protect itself by\nattacking the human immune system.\nSufferers from AIDS are vulnerable\nto any infection that is going.\nAlthough we know little about the\norigins of the disease, we can say\nquite a lot about what it has been\ndoing in the last seven years.\nIn June 1981, five young men in\nSan Fransisco were reported to be\nsuffering from a rare condition called\nPneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia. All\nthe men admitted to being\npromiscuous homosexuals, and this\nconfinement to one sexual group,\ncombined with the rarity of the\ncondition, caused some alarm among\nthe American medical community. By\nJuly, a total of 26 cases had been\nrecognised, all of them in homosexual\nmen, and some of them dating back\nto 1978. Many of the men exhibited\nan even rarer condition called\nKaposi's Sarcoma, which causes\nunsightly swellings on the skin. This\nis now one of the most publicly\nrecognised symptoms of the disease\nwe have come to know as 'Acquired\nImmune Deficiency Syndrome', or\nAIDS.\nThe combination of two such rare\nproblems confined to such a narrow\ngroup represented a serious cause for\nconcern. The most plausible\nexplanation seemed to be a total lack\nof cell-mediated immunity, and a search was begun for verification and\na medical cause.\nIt was popular during that period\nfor certain groups of homosexuals to\nuse drugs to heighten the sexual\nexperience, and it was thought\npossible that this practise could\nprovide a chemical cause for the\ncondition, although some\npractitioners favoured the idea of an\naccumulation of sexually transmitted\ndiseases. This led to the questioning\nof the sufferers about their recent\nsexual contacts, during which an\nastounding fact came to light: A few\nof them claimed to have had as many\nas two thousand sexual contacts\nduring their lives, with many listing\nhundreds. This extraordinary degree\nof promiscuity meant that if the\ndisease was sexually transmitted, they\nhad been very highly exposed to it.\nIt also made the task of checking on\ntheir contacts very protracted.\nIn 1982, as the number of cases\nbegan to increase, reports were being\ncollected regularly by the United\nStates Centre for Disease Control,\nwho noticed that some Haitian men\nwho were not homosexual were\ndeveloping the condition. At the same\ntime, the first reports of cases\noccurred in haemophilia cs and\nwomen, thus proving beyond doubt\nthat the disease was not confined to\nhomosexual men. All the women who\ndeveloped AIDS had been in sexual\ncontact, or had shared intravenous\ninjection equipment with infected\nmen, and this, in conjunction with the\nhaemophilia c cases, implied that\ninfection took place by blood\ntransfer rence or sexual contact, in a similar manner to the spread of\nHepatitis B. It was also early in 1982 that the\nfirst case of AIDS was recognised in\nthe UK, and by the end of the year\nthe number had risen to three, all of\nwhom could be shown to have had\ncontacts in the United States. This\nprovided compelling evidence that\nAIDS was an infectious disease, and\none with a long incubation period,\nwhich had spread first and fastest\namong very promiscuous homosexual\nmen, but which could be caught by\nanyone. This is demonstrated by the\nsituation in some African states,\nwhere the disease is distributed evenly\nbetween men and women of all sexual\norientations. It is thought that the\nrapid spread in these countries may\nbe due to the high incidence of\nprostitution.\nA concentrated search took place\nfor the cause of the disease, and in\n1983 it was traced to a virus which\nwas very similar to a leukaemia-causing virus discovered in 1981.\nBecause of this similarity it was\nnamed Human T Cell Leukaemia\nVirus 3, or HTLV3. This virus was\ncultured in the laboratory and used to\ndevelop an antibody test which could\nbe applied both to patients blood\nsamples, and to donated blood. This\ngave effective protection to\nhaemophilia cs, since from October\n1985 they, and all other NHS patients\nreceived only screened blood. Before\nthis date, blood had been heat-treated\nto kill viral infections. As a result,\npatients in the UK now have little or\nnothing to fear from blood\ntransfusions.\nThat is how the situation stands at\nthe time of writing. The medical\nservices have been unable to develop\neither an effective vaccine, or a cure.\nHowever, several laboratories are\ncultivating the virus, now named\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus or\nHIV. This allows extracts of HIV to\nbe tested for potential use as a vaccine, and also provides viruses for\nuse in antiviral drug trials.\nEarlier this month, the government\nreleased the latest figures for the\nnumber of people in this country who\nhave developed AIDS. These figures\n689\nFigure I Cumulative totals of recognised\ncases of AIDS in the UK, by year.\n1981 1982 1 983 1 984 1985 1986 1987\n\n"

    "content": "Letters. FELIX, Friday February 20th19872 Criminal\nBotha\nDear Dave,\nI write in response to Mike's letter\n(FELIX 763) concerning his support\nof Mr. Goosen and his South African\ngovernment's incursions into\nneighbouring states. I am sure there\nare many more poeple who are just\nas ignorant about the situation in\nSouthern Africa as Mike is.\nTo me, the application of the phrase\n\"supporting terrorism,\" in his letter\nwhen referring to South Africa's neighbouring states was not only\nimproper but misleading as well, and\ntherefore, needs correction here.\nThose the South African regime has\nlabelled \"terrorists\" do not live in\nneighbouring states nor are they\ntrained there. What these innocent\nstates do harbour are defenceless\nrefugees who have escaped from\nBotha's \"Soweto Jail\" in search of\nfreedom. Indeed, all Botha's past\nattacks on his neighbours have been\ntarget ted at refugee camps, maiming\nevery resident\u2014child or aged. Surely,\nto support a regime which commits\nsuch unforgivable acts of a gres sion would be ignorance of the highest\norder which cannot be left\nunchallenged. To accommodate a refugee is no crime and I strongly\nbelieve there is no country in the\nworld, today, that does not harbour\nany.\nTo have an ANC office in a neighbouring state is not different\nfrom having one inside South Africa\nitself. Winnie Mandela and Bishop\nTutu live in South Africa, yet they\nstill openly oppose the racist\ngovernment just as Oliver Tambo\ndoes across the borders. Nelson\nMandela has openly declared he shall\nlive nowhere but in Johannesberg,\nwhere his home once was, yet the\nSouth African government has,\nbefore, \"offered\" him freedom on\nthe condition that he went to live in\none of the neighbouring states while\nnegotiations are on. Surely, if they\nknew his presence in a neighbouring\nstate would be a threat could they\nhave made the offer? Why would\nBotha rather have Mandela abroad\nthan home? Only part of the answer\nis these questions are useful to the\nsubject at hand: Botha has always\nfound it easier to pursue and murder\nblack South Africans abroad than at\nhome. In the former case there is a loophole\u2014he claims they are\nterrorists being harbour ed by his\nneighbours and in the majority of\nthese atrocities he has managed to\nreceive a sympathetic ear from his\nworshippers. In the latter (for which\nthe Sharpville Massacre is an\nexample) he has received no cover-up, not even from his own henchmen!\nHis choice, therefore remains\nobvious.\nWhen Germany once dominated\nEurope with her military supremacy,\nEuropeans reacted and Hitler paid a price for it. Similarly, I believe,\npeople in Southern Africa will react\nand Botha will do likewise. I hope the\nANC will remember to put the\nworld's \"No. 1 criminal\" (Botha) in\na cage in a history museum\nsomewhere in Soweto when it comes\nto power. I am sure that will attract\ntourists from all over the world\u2014I will be there!\nY Mponella, Mech. Eng. II.\nIn God he\ntrusts\nDear Sir,\nI recently read a letter in FELIX\ncomplaining about the appointment of\na gay and lesbian officer to the Union\nCouncil, and the reply to it.\nThe letter basically pointed out that\ngays and lesbians are just one of many\nminorities in the College, and the\nreply insisted that people need to be\nenlightened to accept homosexuality\nas normal.\nAs I read these letters, and many\nothers like them elsewhere, I was\nreally saddened. There seem to be so\nmany people insisting that their way\nis right. So many people pressing for\none cause or another, with no time to\nlisten to anyone else. The desire to\nstamp their own ethics on society, and\nto have them accepted. And I can\nunderstand that the motive behind this\nis a concern for the individuality of\neach person. A concern for the\nfreedom of individuals. And inside\nevery person is a frustrated yearning\nfor freedom\u2014freedom from\neverything that suppresses them or\nholds or ties them down. But how\nmuch room have people left in all this\nfor God? He's been dismissed almost\nwithout exception, without a moment's thought. \"Oh, I don't believe in God.\" And that's it out of\nthe way. But what if he did have\nsomething to say? What if, despite\nhowever un trendy it might be, God\ndid actually exist? And, not only\nexist, but actually really care? I read\nrecently an article in 'New Society'\non London's down and outs in the\ncold freeze of last month; it\nconcluded:\n\"And yet, and yet...disgusting,\nsmelly, noisy, nauseous, drunk and\ndrugged, the rag g let a gg le army of\nPiccadilly ne'er-do-wells, rent boys, dos s ers, tramps, feckless, homeless\nand jobless who briefly swamped St.\nJames's Church were all these things,\nbut the scenes on the floor of the\nchurch were also weirdly moving.\nThere was something very odd about\nthe contrast between the beauty of the\nWren church and the misshapen\nhuman beings who came in from the\ncold. Something troubling and\ndisturbing for the contemporary\natheistic mind. Something you could\nalmost call\u2014the nearest thing to a dirty word in 1987\u2014holy.\"\nNew Society, 30th Jan. 1987\nWhat if, what if? I wonder how\nmany people really honestly ask that\nquestion? How many people, in all the\nstriving for acceptance, striving for\nidentity, for joy, for freedom, how\nmany everyday people, like you and\nme, ask? What if?\nGod does care, more than we could\never dream of. Not only does he care,\nhe really hurts when he sees us\ndesperately chasing after vain\nexpressions of love and freedom, and\nsees us destroying ourselves. When\nwe turn our backs on him, and just\ndismiss him with that arrogance \"Oh,\nI don't believe,\" his heart weeps for\nus. If only we had just the vaguest\nnotion of who God really is, and what\nhe's been through for us in Jesus, it\nwould break every one of us. Just the\nsmallest glimpse of his awesome\npower, of his purity and holiness. Of\nthe depth, the depth of his love for\neach one of us as an individual\nperson...if only, we'd cry out to him.\nBut people are so content just to go\non, without ever coming face to face\nwith the possibility that maybe, just\nmaybe, they're wrong. Maybe, just\nmaybe there's a God waiting for each\none of us to turn round and find him\nthere. Just waiting for us to reach out\nand touch him, to cry out to him from\nthe bottom of our hearts. He's so\nlonging for us to. And the irony of\nit all is that the very love, freedom\njoy, identity, fulfilment etc. that we're\nall so busy striving for, is found right\nthere, in Jesus, whom we so casually\ndismissed in the first place.\nAnd that's what really saddened me\nwhen I read those letters. If only...\nRob Brown, Civ. Eng. PG.\nThe sound of\nsilence\nDear Dave,\nWe would like to make a protest\nabout the IC Union policy for letting\nrooms in the Union Building for\nparties; in particular the City and\nGuilds Dinner Dance held on the\nmorning of Saturday, February 7th. At 3 o 'clock in the morning we and\nmany other residents of Beit Hall\nwere woken by the start of the party\nwhich was destined to continue until\n6.00am. Two sets of windows, Beit\nHall pillows and a mere 25 feet of\nfresh air could not deaden the noise\nto any great extent!\nParties which end at 1.30 or 2.00\nin the morning as Beit residents who\ndo not wish to attend may go out and\nseek other entertainment or rest\nassured that the noise will go away\nsometime. However, at three in the\nmorning no one is in the mood to seek\nother non-existent diversions and nor\nis the noise likely to go away at any\nreasonable hour.\nWe are not saying that such early\nmorning parties should not be held,\nmerely that they should be put in\nrooms not less than 100 yards from\nthe nearest sleeping student. Surely\nin the future efforts can be made to\nuse rooms in the Sherfield Building\nor even on the left hand side of the\nUnion Building, which has similar\nrooms to those so close to our own\nwindows; then the noise can only\ndisturb empty offices or the shrubbery\nin the Life Sci. Building.\nSimon Buyers, MRE I. Neil Bolton, Life Sci. I. Jon Beadsmoore, Phys. I and most of Beit Hall, Old Hostel.\nExtreme\nAllen\nDear Sir,\nI am writing in reply to Mike\nAllen's letter in last week's FELIX\n(No. 763) expressing his view that\nterrorism should be fought by killing\nits perpetrators.\nI would like to ask Mr Allen just\nwhat is his objection to terrorism. It\nis obviously not that it has a low\nregard for human life: Mr Allen\nplainly shares this attitude.\nFurthermore, his opposition cannot be\ndue to the fact that terrorists are\nprepared to go to such lengths to\nachieve their aims, and are therefore\n'extremists': Mr Allen is also, by this\ndefinition, an extremist.\nHis only justification for the views\nexpressed in his letter must be a childishly simplistic 'goodies and\nbaddies' philosophy which leads him\nto believe that any ideology\ndisagreeing with his own should be\nannihilated. This argument is exactly\nthat used by the terrorists themselves\nto attempt to justify their actions.\nMr Allen's statement that \"if our\nforces withdrew (from Northern\nIreland) this violence would no doubt\nescalate\" is shortsighted in the\nextreme. Any attempt to \"track these\nmurderers down and kill them\" as he\ncontinued on page 4.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications\nBoard and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit.

It is\nworrying to note that the number of\nheterosexuals affected has reached\n2.8% of the total. The increase in this\npercentage is currently very slow, and\nat this level it could be possible to\ncontain the risk of significant spread\nin this group. However, this will only\nbe achieved if every effort is made to\nkeep the level of public knowledge of\nthe disease at a maximum. To further\nthe truths, and destroy some of the\nmyths of AIDS.\nAIDS is transmitted via blood,\neither through transfusions or on IV\nneedles or surgical equipment. It is\nalso transmitted by sexual contact,\nthat is by contact between the sexual\nsecretions\u2014semen or vaginal fluid\u2014\nand the membranes of the vagina,\nmouth or anus.\nDoes anyone have any questions?\nTigure2\nHf to woo O WO too woo The boxed figure represents the\nproportion of non\u2014homosexual\nsufferers from AIDS.\nThe fantasies and the facts\nQ: Who is most at risk?\nA: Anyone who is promiscuous,\nespecially homosexual men. Anyone\nreceiving blood transfusions in parts\nof the world where the donated blood\nis not screened for the AIDS virus.\nAnyone receiving injections with an\ninfected needle, and especially drug\nmis users who share injection\nequipment.\nQ: Can you catch AIDS from oral\nsex?\nA: It is quite possible. The greatest\ndanger is to those who actually\nswallow semen or vaginal fluid, but\nthe presence of these secretions in the\nmouth can be hazardous, especially\nif you have sores or ulcers in the\nmouth. Even in the absence of these,\ntransmission could happen via membrane penetration. The best bet is to\navoid oral sex unless you are sure.\nQ: If you have sex, how can you\nstay safe from AIDS?\n: The fewer people you have sex with,\nthe safer you are. Remember that\nprostitutes may have taken to the\nstreet to finance a drug addiction,\nwhich makes them doubly dangerous.\nAvoid them. Cut out casual\nrelationships and one-night stands.\nKnow your partner! If you must have\nsex with someone other than your\nusual partner, use a condom to reduce\nthe risk of infection\u2014it does work.\nRemember, if you catch AIDS you\ncan pass it on to your usual partner.\nQ: Are you less likely to catch AIDS\nif your partner is more gentle with\nyou?\nA: No. This idea arose through the\ntheory that mucosa which had been\ndamaged through excess force would\nbe more permeable, but there are\ncases on record of women catching\nAIDS through artificial insemination,\nwhich was no Houbt a very gentle\nprocess.\nQ: Can you catch AIDS from non-sexual body contact?\nA: No. It is quite alright to shake\nhands, share cups, utensils, etc.\nQ: If you need blood, or dental or\nmedical treatment involving\ninjections, can you catch the AIDS\nvirus?\nA: In this country it is almost\nimpossible, but in some parts of the\nworld blood is not checked for\ninfection, and medical or surgical\nequipment may not be adequately\nsterilised. Try to avoid treatment\ninvolving injections and surgical\nprocedures, and receiving blood from\nlocal donors, under these\ncircumstances.\nQ: Can you catch AIDS from\nkissing or heavy petting?\nA: No. Although the virus has been\nisolated in saliva and tears, it is only\npresent in very low concentrations,\nand does not appear to be infectious\nfrom this source. You can kiss and pet\nas intensely as you like, provided that\nblood or sexual secretions do not enter\nyou partner's body. Accidental\nspillages of blood or sexual secretions\ncan safely be washed off normal skin,\nas soap and water effectively kills or\nremoves the virus.\nQ: Can you catch Aids from a toothbrush or razor?\nA: Possibly, as these may become\nbloodstained, and cause small\nscratches of the face or mouth. You\nmight also easily catch other things,\nincluding herpes, so it is best to avoid\nsharing anyway.\nQ: Can you catch AIDS from a toilet seat or a towel?\nA: No.\nQ: How easy is it to be tested for\nHIV infection?\nA: You can apply in total confidence\nto any special clinic, either STDSexually Transmitted Diseases, or\nGUM\u2014Genitourinary Medicine.\nYou will almost certainly be offered\ncounselling, information and advice\nbefore the test is carried out, and\nagain if necessary in a few days when\nthe result is available.\nThe warning\nIt is likely that you, the reader, fall\ninto a low-risk group. You are\nprobably heterosexual, and you\nprobably don't inject drugs. But just\nsuppose that you caught AIDS - it\nisn't impossible. Then suppose that\nyou passed it onto someone who was\npromiscuous. Within a month, they\nmight infect five people...who might\ninfect twenty...who might infect a hundred...and then five hundred...\nand then two thousand...\nIn other words, the next time you cry\nout with passion, you could be sowing\nthe seeds for two thousand cries of\nmisery.\nAIDS is a threat to us all, whatever\nwe are. We all have a responsibility\nto ourselves and to our fellow\nmembers of society, to behave\nsensibly and to heed the warnings\ngiven to us.\nWhen writing this article, I tried my\nbest to think of some final, convincing\nparagraph, some way of expressing\nmy concern and the concern of the\npeople I have spoken to while\ngathering information. Although, as\nshown earlier, there are only about\nseven hundred developed cases of\nAIDS in this country at the moment,\nremember that there may be many\nmore people carrying the virus.\nNobody was prepared to tell me\nexactly how many; perhaps nobody\nreally knows. My main source, who\nhas asked to remain anonymous,\nlooked at me hopelessly, and said:\n\"Everyone seems to expect us to\nstop this thing by magic. We do have\na way of stopping it, without ever\nproducing any drugs, All we have to\ndo is stop passing it on. Somehow I don't expect this to happen.\"\nI asked why.\n\"We have all known since 1961\nthat smoking causes heart disease,\ncancer, bronchitis, you name it.\nWarnings are printed on every packet\nof cigarettes. How many people have\ngiven up smoking? About ten per\ncent. Which do you think is the\ngreater human urge, to smoke or to\nmake love? Please tell them to be\ncareful.\"\n'Them' means us. All of us.\n\n"

So\nwhat's all this cheap thriller knock-on-the-door-in-the-middle-of-the-night stuff about?\nOne is occasionally driven to\nwonder whether it's not an elaborate\nploy to advance Mr Campbell's fr\nom the h\" foment r \u00bb\u201e :S'.70 ft (21.3 \u201e7? \u00b0f antenna.\ncontent of their programmes in the\nrun up to an election. It is worth\nremembering that any review of\nsecrecy legislation in the light of the\nZircon affair could lead to more,\nrather than less, restrictive conditions.\nThe search for motives can be\nendless, in fact so good a subject for\nthe imagination is it that you can bet\nthere will be any number of books\ncashing in on it. What's more you can\nwhich the announcement that they\nwere in breach of the official secrets\nact was met with a loud cheer, the\nmeeting went straight into a showing\nof a quite clear tape of the offending\nitem.\nThe audience saw Mr Duncan\nCampbell leaping from dish-covered\nground station to dish-covered ground\nstation presenting a sort of 'Boys\nOwn' Guide to signals intelligence\nsatellites. Interspersed with Mr\nCampbell's concerned boy scout\nvisage was lots of stock footage of\nrockets taking off and people\nassembling civilian satellites. Later\nwe were treated to several interviews\nwith assorted civil servants and ex-science advisors.\nThe best of these was an interview\nwith a former Chief Scientific\nAdvisor to the MoD who happily\nchatted for several minutes about the\ntheory of spy satellites and their\nobvious detect ability. However, his\nface dropped and he sat frozen for a good ten seconds when asked about\nthe Zircon project. When he finally\ncame round from this icicles-in-the-underwear like trance, he only\nmanaged to burble something about\nnot having heard of this project.\nIt emerged fairly clearly that once\nyou launch a spy satellite anyone\nwhose technology has advanced to the\nlevel of the telescope can deduce what\nit is. A number of references were\nmade to the relationship between US\nand British intelligence services but\nno insinuation was really made to\nanything you couldn't have read in the\npress during the GCHQ dispute. Then\nin the last five minutes Mr Campbell's monologue launched into the cost of\nthe whole enterprise and how our\nproject costing more than \u00a3250m \u2014\nyet here was this unheard of Zircon\nproject costing twice that.\nThe attempts at covering up the\nexistence of the Zircon project were\nshown to be amateur in the extreme.\nIt was alleged that the Zircon satellite\nwould be sent up under the cover of\nbeing a Skynet (military\ncommunications) satellite. When the\nplanned launching of the first two\nSky nets were announced, so were the\nnames of Britain's first two planned\nastronauts (one from the RAF, one\nfrom the RN), one to accompany each\nsatellite on a space shuttle launch.\nYet, when the 3rd \"Skynet\" was\nannounced, there was no mention of\nany Army astronaut to accompany it.\nThe first two Skynets were being put\nover the Atlantic, but according to a British Aerospace press release of the\ntime, the third \"Skynet\" was going\nup at 52\u00b0 East (ie over Russia), to\nfacilitate communication with the\n\"large British military presence in\nHong Kong.\" When quizzed about\nthis, the MoD replied that the\nsatellite's destination was a secret,\nand the BA press release was quickly\nrehashed to eliminate any mention of\nits intended location. It was admitted\nthat each Skynet needs its own radar\ndish on the ground. Cut to newly built\nSkynet ground base in Hampshire, all\nconstruction complete. Count 'em\ncarefully; yep, there's only two radar\ndishes ie only two Skynet satellites.\nThe im me'J': m press ion left as\nour Duncan's stirring right-to-know\nspeech faded away, amid numerous\nsubtle references to the title of the\nseries, was a doubt that any of the\ncontents could be a strategic secret.\nWe were then treated to Tony Benn\njournalistic career.

Having\nbeaten second-in-the-table Guys l sts21, with a gutsy and determined\ndisplay, and New College 2nds by a similar score line, the 3rds travelled\nto the scene of their recent cup defeat,\nhoping to achieve their first double.\nOn a very heavy pitch IC were slow\nto get into their stride and New\nCollege forced the earlier openings\nbut failed to take advantage. We soon\ntook control with slick first-time\npassing down both flanks. Pressure\npaid off when Wendel Charles' shot\nwas deflected off a defender to find\nthe back of the net. Moments later,\nNew College's goalkeeper patted out\na corner, and Mark Woodgate.\nlurking on the edge of the box. headed\njust over. The second goal was\nvintage football; a precision four-man\nmove down the right found Mark\nRadley in space. Hisfiercecross-shot\nwas turned in by the sliding Mike\nHousby, to make the half-time score\nm20. Not surprisingly New College\nrallied for an early second-half goal\nbut the aerial domination by Martin\nLake, ably supported by the fast\ncovering slide tackles of Mark\nWoodgate ensured New College\ndidn't trouble keeper Mike Kemp.\nBoth full-backs Russ Dark and Martin\nDixon assisted in arguably our best\nattacking display this season. Mike\nPlummer's consistent breaks down\nthe left ruthlessly demoralized the\nNew College fullback whose tackles\nseemed close to desperation as well\nas somewhat ineffective. A determined Mike Plummer run and\ncross found Paul Thompson whose\nfierce six-yard volley whistled past a static New College keeper. Our\nopponents responded well with a swift\ncounter attack and finely-struck\nconsolation goal. Any 3rds complacency vanished and a lightning\nmove found Mike Housby in space\nbut his clever chip was acrobatic ally turned over. A fine sole goal by\nWendel Charles made it 4-1.\nBreaking from a corner, Wendel\nreceived the ball on the half-way line,\npowered past two defenders who\nembarrassingly lacked pace, to\ndelightfully clip the ball over a bewildered New College keeper.\nMinutes later Mike Housby and Mike\nPlummer rounded the keeper and\nside-footed home.\nMidfield dynamos Paul Thompson\nand Kevin Graves battled hard to deny\nNew College space. Indeed. Kevin,\nso dominant in the Cup game, had no\nchances, but with everyone else\ndemonstrating lethal finishing, it\ndidn't matter.\nA stark con stra st to our last visit\nhere; creating fewer chances but\nevery one decisive. A fine display of\nattacking football, hopefully to\ncontinue in subsequent games.\nTeam: Mike Kemp, Martin Dixon,\nMark Woodgate (Capt), Martin Lake,\nRuss Dark, Paul Thompson, Kevin\nGraves, Mike Plummer, Mark Redley,\nWendel Charles, Mike Housby.\nSailing\nIC vs Bath and Oxford\nSaturday 14th and\nSunday 15th February\nDouble\nvictory\nFor yet another weekend in a row, IC\nsailing team had a very successful\nouting. The challenge this week came\nfrom Bath, but on arriving at their\nhome reservoir, we discovered that\nOxford had also sent their team to try\nand break our streak of unbeaten\nmatches.\nThe first match to be sailed was\nagainst Bath and Richard Brimlow's daring but excellent starting tactics in\nthe first and second races, led\nImperial to resounding wins. In the\nthird race IC made the mistake of not\ntaking their opposition seriously and\nwere punished by losing the race. The\nfinal score, 2-1 gave the match to\nImperial.\nA more serious challenge was\nposed by Oxford who even recruited\ntwo American sailors in an attempt to\nstrengthen their side. But their\nunprecedented aggression on the start\nline, found its match in Apostolos\nLeouidhopoulos. who hadn't smoked\nfor a week. It was a tough match and\nthe aggression resulted in Richard\nJarman needing a physiotherapist\nafter a minor h^ ck injury. The match\nwas finally ,..

However, even the\nmost ardent of their fans were\ncontemplating retiring to the bar by\nhalf time, due to the appallingly\nboring, goalless first half. In fairness\nthe IC defence was excellent, and S Gordon was working hard and\neffectively in attack. However, the\nmidfield had so far been\nunimaginative and poor in their\npassing execution.\nThe second half started where the\nfirst left off, and then after 20 minutes\nIC woke up. Buckley. Keelim and\nMcDonald started causing problems\ndown the right. Barrow also began to\nget forward and it was his low curling\nfree kick which led to an innovative\ndummy by Gordon, leaving\nBioekhuizen to flick the ball into the\nnet.\nInspired by this. IC kept up the\npressure and their control on the\ngame. The two points were safely\nensured when D Semeiria headed\nacross the goal and Keelin came\nflying in at the far post and although\nhis shot was helped into the net by a defender he was dubiously given the\ncredit for the goal.\nTeam: J Wreford, N McDonald,\nS Dunthorne, S Laverick, J Holland, M Barrow, A Keelin, K Buckley, D Semeiria, S Gordon,\nN. Broekhuizen. Man of the\nmatch: S Gordon.\nHyde Park Relay\nRun inthe\nPark\nThose of you who were around the\nUnion last weekend would probably\nhave noticed the 1100 runners or so\npresent at this year's relay. As\nalways, the standard was very high\nwith most of the top student runners\npresent although an unfortunate clash\nwith the women's National meant\nsome of the better women were\nabsent. The men's race was won by\nLoughborough University in 84min Msec, ahead of Oxford and West\nLondon IHE. Imperial were back in\n54th place though half the 6-man team\nalso ran for London University,\nwhich finished a creditable 8th despite\na weakened team.\nAltogether, 117 men's teams\n\u2022completed the course as well as 28\nguest teams including Nat West Bank\nwho were first across the line in\n84-06. The guest teams also included\nsome well known athletes such as\nDave Clarke, who clocked the fastest\nindividual time of 13-17, and Nick\nRose. For the official teams, 5\nseconds separated the five fastest\nindividuals with S Newport of West\nLondon IHE being quickest at 13-32.\nEx-IC runner Sam Carey was third\nfastest in 13-34.\nIn the women's race, Oxford turned\nthe tables on Loughborough, winning\nby 20 seconds in 58-42. This followed\nthe disqualification of Leeds who\nfinished 2 seconds ahead of Oxford\nbut had one runner doing two legs.\nThe fastest individual was London's Lisa Webb who covered the 2 mile\nloop in 11-18.\nMany thanks to all those who\nhelped on the day\nRESULTS Wednesday February11 th Football iC 2nds2 St Mary's0 Saturday February14 th Football New College 2nds1 IC 3rds5 IC 1sts10 London Hospital 3\nRSM 4 Camborne 2\nRugby RSM 3 Camborne 18\nHockey RSM 3 Camborne 0\nSquash RSM 1 Camborne 4\nSunday February15 th Football Selkirk Hall 1 Tizard Hall 4\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX, Friday February 20th19876 THE O BEL PRIZE Its history, scientific importance and political impact Among the first things pointed out to\naspiring Imperial College physics\nstudents at their interviews are the\nthree Nobel Prize certificates on the\nwall outside lecture theatre one. In the\nsame way, chemistry candidates are\ninformed the of presence of a Nobel\nLaureate on the staff. Such revelations\nare meant to inspire awe and\nadmiration in the mind of the public.\nRecipients of the prize are elevated\nto a scientific elite, and the reputation\nof their department is made. The\nprestige of the award goes further\nthan this. Such is its fame, that it has\neven become a political tool, with\ngovernments quoting Prizes per capita\nas a statistical illustration of their\nnational excellence.\nWhen Alfred Nobel died in 1896 he\nleft an estate totalling some thirty-three million kroner, in today's terms,\nthe hefty figure of eighty million\ndollars. He specified -that his estate\nshould be put aside and maintained,\nits annual income being divided\namong five prizes, three in science,\none in literature, and one to \"further\nthe cause of world peace.\" A prize\nfor economics was introduced in\n1969. Nobel could not have foreseen\nthe fame which his prizes would\naccrue. Nor could he have foreseen\nthe controversy which the prizes for\nliterature and peace would attract.\nThe reason for Nobel's generosity\nstems from his life's work.\nParadoxically this ingenious inventor\nof dynamite, blasting gelatine, and\nsmokeless powder was a pacifist who\ndespised the results of his labour. He\nhoped his prize for peace would\npromote \"fraternity among nations\"\nand that the prizes for science\n(including medicine) might produce\ndiscoveries that would, unlike his\nown, be of peaceful benefit to\nmankind.\nThe complex arrangements for the\nestablishment of the Nobelstiftelsen\n(Nobel Foundation), which distributes\nthe prizes, took four years to\ncomplete. Not until the fifth\nanniversary of Nobel's death, on 10th December 1901, were the first prizes\ndistributed.\nThe prize has been used as a measure of the standing of nations and\norganisations right from the\nbeginning. Germany's fall from\nscientific dominance has been related\nto the great number of Nobel laureates\nforced into exile during the\npredominance of the Third Reich.\nSimilarly, the corresponding\nascendency of the United States in the\nfield of science has been related to the\nincreasing number of laureates it has\nproduced. Ironically, many of them\nwere expatriate Germans in exile.\nExamining national totals of prizes\nawarded reveals .an interesting\nanomaly. It might be expected that\nnations with a large pool of talent to\ndraw on, or a history of scientific\nendeavour, would feature largely in\nthe figures. As a consequence, the\nUnited States dominates the list. Great\nBritain and the other European\nnations occupy the majority of the top\nof the table, but the Soviet Union has\nproduced only nine Nobel laureates,\ntwo of them before the Revolution.\nOne Soviet bureaucrat observed that\nthe Nobel prize statistics indicate \"an\nac cute deficit of researchers of the\nhighest qualifications in the USSR\".\nExplanations for this shortfall range\nfrom the lack of individual freedom\nin the Soviet Union, to the lack of\nadequate exchanges of information\nwith the West.\nNational totals of Nobel laureates\nare often quoted as vindication of\ngovernment policies on science. More\nrecently, with economic pressure\nmounting on most countries, people\nhave begun to draw attention to the\nfact that although large amounts of\nkudos may be obtained when a nation\nacquires yet another laureate, the\ndesirability of devoting great\nquantities of capital to the type of\nfundamental research that will\nproduce Nobel prize winners is no\nlonger self-evident. In the rarefied\natmosphere of Cambridge, MIT ,Cal\nTech and Imperial this is akin to\nheresy. The Duke of Edinburgh\nremarked, in another famous off-the-cuff Royal Comment that,\"a University should measure its success\njust as much by the number of\nmillion are s as by the Nobel prize-winners it produces.\" With this in\nmind, multinational corporations have\nbeen much more forthcoming in\nscientific funding, with a particular\npractical aim in mind. In 1973, Esaki\nand Giaever, two of the three\nrecipients of the physics prize, had\ntheir research work supported by\nindustry. It is not likely that the\nnumber of million are physicists or\nchemists will in any way increase,\ndespite such moves. The pre dili c tion for claiming laureates as part of\nnational statistics has led to somewhat\nmisleading national credits. Due to\nthe international nature of twentieth\ncentury science, many Nobel winners\nhave done the majority of their work\nin a country other than that of their\nbirth. In reporting the nationality of\nlaureates the Nobel Foundation uses\nthe country of citizenship as its\ncriterion. However, this gives few\nclues as to the country in which the\nsignificant part of their scientific\ntraining and research was done. For\n\n"

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday February 20th19875 International Week\na review\nHow many Imperial College students\nare aware that this week is\nInternational Week? Very few,\njudging from the disappointingly low\nattendance at the talks, film, and\nsymposiums organised by the\nOverseas Student's Committee.\nInternational Week began on\nMonday with an opening speech by\nthe Rector on \"The Significance of\nthe International Community at\nImperial College.\" He stated that he\nhimself was born in Germany, and\nthat one of the remarkable facts about\nImperial College and the University\nof London as a whole was that it\ncomprises a \"fairly international\ncommunity\", 20% of all students at\nIC being foreign. This led to\ncomments on the financial\nimplications of a relatively large\noverseas student population. The\nRector said that the cuts in grants\nallocated to universities have forced\nthem to accept more overseas\nstudents; Imperial College is no\nexception and fees from overseas\nstudents represent 7 % of the College\nincome, but the level of foreign\nstudents has not risen significantly\nsince the new legislation was passed.\nThe Rector deplored the fact that high\nfees were a deter ent to many foreign\nstudents.\nThe cultural contribution made by\nthe international community was seen\nby the Rector as \"an enormous\nenrichment of the experience of\nstudying at university\" for British\nstudents. He nevertheless deplored\nthe phenomenon of \"people from\ncountry X spending all their time with\npeople from country X,\" clearly a problem at IC.\nOn the subject of religion, the\nRector advocated firstly that scientists\nbecome aware that \"Newton's laws\nand Schrodinger's wave equation\"\nare not all there is to knowledge, and\nconfessed \"some religious feeling\"\nbut no adherence to any particular\nreligion. Secondly he advocated\ntolerance of other religious beliefs and\nnoted that minor differences between\nsimilar religions are often a source of\nconflict, as is the case in Northern\nIreland.\nThe third main topic was conflict,\nthe avoidance of which \"is a principal\nconcern for mankind.\" The Rector\nhoped that students from countries\nengaged in war \"spoke to each other''\nand noted that feeling about research\nfor defence was a major sore point.\nOn this subject he referred to the\nStrategic Defence Initiative (SDI),\nadding that he considered it a \"technological nonsense\" and giving\nreasons. He would nevertheless\nconsider accepting a SDI contract at\nImperial College if it were on\n\"normal commercial terms\" and on\na subject that he wished to see\nresearched.\nOn Tuesday a symposium took\nplace in Chem Eng Lecture Theatre\n1 involving representatives of the\nCommonwealth Office and the Royal\nSociety. The topic was\n\"Sociocultural, scientific and\ntechnological cooperation begins\nhere.\" Although less than twenty\npeople attended, a positive debating\natmosphere was created which\nencouraged questions from the floor.\nImportant issues were raised, such\nas the free flow of scientists between\nnations, the economic and cultural\ncooperation which it involved, the\nrole of the UN agencies in the transfer\nof technology, and problems arising\nfrom delicate political situations. A central question from the floor related\nto the intellectual boycott of South\nAfrica, and whether free flow of\nscientists should be extended to such\ncountries as the USSR, Cuba or\nTaiwan. The topic of human rights\nand the intervention* of politics in\nscientific research were also discussed\nand international scientific\ncooperation was seen as necessary in\nthe solution of problems posed by, for\nexample, pollution control and AIDS.\nIt was concluded that international\ncooperation should involve both the\nexchange of individuals and of\nknowledge, and that this should be\ndone to the benefit of all nations.\nSundiatu Dixon-Fyle\nIC Radio is back\n999 KHz\nImperial College Radio is\nnow broadcasting at full\npower on 301 metres\nMedium Wave, following\nrealignment of our\ntransmitter.

    "content": "Feature FELIX, Friday February 20th198712 Culture vulture Gren Manuel Although the process by which DNA\ncreates proteins is now largely\nunderstood, there is still much to learn\nabout the way that living cells grow.\nCells with the same genetic\ninformation in an organism somehow\nmanage to grow in different ways and\nat different rates. A better\nunderstanding of cell growth would\nbe very useful, as it could lead to\nfaster-growing crops and improved\nhealing of wounds.\nDr Andrew Goldsworthy and his\nteam in the Pure and Applied Biology\nDepartment have been working in this\narea, and have recently received a \u00a347,000 grant from the Agriculture\nand Food Research Council to\ncontinue their work for three years.\nThey have been doing experiments\nwith 'callus' cultures. If a plant is\ndamaged the first cells which grow at\nthe site of the damage are callus\ncells\u2014these are amorphous and\nun specialised. As repair continues the\ncallus becomes differentiated, and\nvascular tissue and other specialised\ntypes of cell appear. In a laboratory\na callus will reproduce indefinitely in\na nutrient culture.\nCallus cultures like these are\nproduced after experiments which\nalter the genetic information in a cell.\nAfter the DNA is modified cells are\nput into a nutrient solution and they\nreproduce to form a callus. However\nthe special is ation that takes place in\na callus which is part of a plant does\nnot always occur if the callus is\ncultured in a laboratory and the roots,\nleaves and stem of a 'normal' plant\nare not present the new strain cannot\nbe taken out of the laboratory.\nSometimes this differentiation will\nspontaneously start taking place, and\nonce started the shoots can be\ntransplanted and made to grow into\n'proper' plants. However this\nspontaneous ordering is very hit-and-miss, and in some species does not\nhappen at all.\nDr Goldsworthy and his team\ndiscovered that by passing a weak\nelectric current through the callus\nculture (in the order of micro-amps)\nthey could could increase the rate of\ncell growth by as much as 70% and\nalso greatly increase the incidence of\nthis spontaneous differentiation. This\ndiscovery alone could reduce the lab\ncosts of genetic engineering\nsignificantly.\nIt appears that electric fields play\na very important part in plant growth\nand differentiation. By pumping ions\n(charged particles) across their\nmembranes cells can create and\ncontrol an electric field across\nthemselves. This can influence the\nway proteins behave, and affect the\norganisation and structure of the cell.\nA study of the electric fields of\nalgae has shown that under normal\ncircumstances they are aligned in a similar way to the domains in a magnet. In the callus culture the\nelectric fields of the cells are\ndistributed randomly, similar to the\ndomains in an un magnetised piece of\niron. The co-ordination of the cells'\nelectric fields appears to be an\nimport art ant part of the mechanism\nwhich shows cells 'where they are'\nand 'what they are meant to be'. The\ncurrent applied by Dr Goldsworthy\nseems to act as a 'compass', helping\nthe cells align their own electric fields\nand therefore promoting growth and\nspecial is ation. The \u00a347,000 received by Dr\nGoldsworthy and his team is to cover\nbasic research for three years into the\nway that electric fields affect cell\ngrowth. There are many possible\napplications: it is known that passing\na small electric current across the site\nof a bone fracture will promote rapid\nhealing and that skin regeneration\nafter a burn can be accelerated,\nshowing that animal cell growth uses\nelectric fields too. In addition electric\ncurrents have been used to allow frogs\nwhich have had legs removed to grow\nthem back (frogs, of course, along\nwith the other higher animals do not\nregenerate lost limbs). There are\nmany possible advances in\nagriculture, medicine and biology.\nThere is more information about\nelectric fields and cell growth in Dr\nGoldsworthy's article in the New\nScientist of 2nd January, 1986.\nReview: Siegfried Sassoon Those with an interest in poetry or\nacting or both should try and catch\nSiegfried Sassoon at the Apollo before\nits short run ends.\nPeter Barkworth plays Sassoon and\nhas, himself, put this one-man-play\ntogether, using Sassoon's writings\nalone. He has restricted his attention\nto the poet's young life up to the end\nof the Great War and the texts he has\nutilised form a remarkably accurate\nportrait of the soldier poet.\nWhat is most interesting in this play\nis the poet-making experience. The\nearly part shows us sensitive articulate\nbut not particularly interesting or\nunique youth. Then, gradually and\nfinally markedly, we see in Sassoon's writing the profound changes induced\nby the traumas of war. Excitement\nand sense of purpose; sadness,\nrevulsion, protest, futility and\nemotional exhaustion. Sassoon in\ncommon with his generation\nencountered these and made his name\nby expressing them. There is always\ninterest in their experience. One could\nnever dismiss such horrifying ly human subject matter as clich e. What is also interesting in this play\nis Barkworth's solo performance. He\nhas not attempted an impersonation of\nSassoon, preferring to let the \"prose\nand poetry speak for themselves, free\nfrom as many additives or artificial\ncolourings as possible.\" However, he\ncommunicates a great enthusiasm and\nlove for Sassoon's work and there is\nmuch to enjoy in his small caricatures\nand delivery of poems. The success\nof this production is entirely his.\n\n"

So 9 IC players,\nMiner Tim Fisher (who had just\nfinished playing for RSM) and on-loan Paul Bravens were out to give\na good performance.\nIC started solidly but neither side\nshowed any bite in front of goal.\nHowever, after 15 minutes, LH took\nthe lead with a well-taken goal.\nBravens equalise d for IC with an\nequally well-taken goal 5 minutes\nlater, and Byron Wood's thunderous\nleft-foot volley put IC into the lead\nalmost immediately. LH equalise d controversially on the half-hour when\ntheir winger seemed a mile offside,\nbut the goal stood. Bravens continued\nthe goal spree with a superb half-volley which found the top corner.\nSkipper Lunghi was well happy at\nhalf-time with the score at 3-2.\nIC started the second half well and\nafter a few minutes Jim Wilson found\nthe net after he had stayed up for a corner.\nLH pulled a goal back minutes later\nwith a scrambled goal and then piled\nforward looking for the equalise r. The\nturning point of the game came when\nLH's\" equalise r\" was disallowed for\na well-spotted offside.

I Imperial\nAmnesty\nDear FELIX,\nOn Thursday February 19th Amnesty International began a concerted campaign to focus attention\non the use of the death penalty in the\nUnited States of America.\nIn thirty-seven of those states you\ncan be hanged, electrocuted, gassed,\npoisoned or shot for murder. There\nis abundant evidence that the death\nsentence is applied unjustly. Some\nstates permit the execution of children\nand mentally retarded offenders. Poor\npeople and blacks are far more likely\nto receive the death penalty for an\nequivalent offence than are middle-class whites. At least 23 prisoners\nhave been put to death this century for\ncrimes which, it is now known, they\ndid not commit.\nAt present there are 1788 people on\ndeath row in the USA\u2014a record\nnumber. And the rate of executions\nis accelerating. The need for pressure\non the American authorities has never\nbeen more urgent.\nAmnesty International is unconditionally opposed to the death\npenalty, believing it to be \"a cruel,\ninhuman and degrading punish-ment.\" In Amnesty's view: \"it is not\nonly contradictory, but a threat to\nhumane values, for any society to\nproclaim that the taking of life is the\nmost intolerable of crimes and, at the\nsame time to countenance any form\nof execution carried out as an act of\nretribution in the name of society\nitself.\"\nThe Amnesty International group at\nImperial has decided to embrace this\ncampaign fully and is planning a series of events designed to raise the\nrelevant issues at the centre of the\ndeath penalty debate. It also hopes to\nget students involved in letter writing\nto the various state authorities in the\nUSA.\nNo doubt there are many people at\nImperial on both sides of this\ncontentious issue. No doubt many\npeople believe that the execution of\nmurderers or rapists is entirely\njustified and that Amnesty is just\nbeing soft. In the next few months IC\nAmnesty Group hopes that as many\nstudents as possible will get involved\nin this campaign and demonstrate that\nthe abolition of the inhuman rite of\nexecution is a priority for our modern\nsocieties.\nAnyone who is interested in\nabolishing the death penalty in the\nUSA should come to IC Amnesty\nGroup meetings on Tuesdays at\n5.30pm in the Brown Committee\nRoom, top floor of the Union\nBuilding. Alternatively contact: S Bosher (Physics II), O Smart (Physics\nIII), or S Curry (Physics PG, int.\n6729).\nS Curry\nPuerile\nHumour\nDear Dave,\nThe publication of last week's Broadsheet has forced me to write to\nFELIX to express my disquiet at an\nitem which appeared towards the end\nof the edition. The item was a spoof\nadvice piece dealing with the subject\nof AIDS.\nThis was the sort of puerile\npre pubescent humour I would not\nnormally associate with Broadsheet.\nThe article made light of the\nmythology surrounding the virus, and\nin doing so compounded these myths.\nIf the author considers that a subject\nwhich is currently causing so much\npublic concern, and occupying so\nmuch of the government's time, is a fit topic for such immature drivel,\nthen he is of a considerably lower intellect than I already consider him to\nbe.\nI have heard comment to the effect\nthat people will realise the vein in\nwhich such a piece is written, and are\nperfectly able to be discriminating in\ntheir appreciation of it. If this were\nthe case, then we would not currently be experiencing such a massive\nproblem in educating the public as to\nthe dangers of AIDS.\nI would hope that the Broadsheet\neditor will take greater care in accepting such articles for publication in the\nfuture, or can we expect a feature on\nleprosy next week, followed by one\non coronary heart disease, all with a similar total lack of sensitivity and\nperception?\nDave Burns\nPhysics 1.\nThe Great JCR Dream\nICU Council and Tuesday's UGM\naccepted Christine's recommendation\nthat the Union presses for full control\nof the JCR bar and financial\ncompensation for the loss of\nconference income. In the long term,\nthe Union is approving the scheme to\n\"look at the feasibility\" of a new\nJCR\u2014in the same building as the\nSports Hall. Though the Exec are\nconfident that College are now far\nmore receptive to their ideas, it would\nbe idiotic to put much faith in the\nplans for an \"all new\" JCR. This\nvague proposal must not be seen as\na trade-off for accommodating\nadministration when negotiating the\nimmediate future of the JCR and\nSherfield catering. The original plan\nto swap the JCR and the MDH was\nsupposed to be a firm agreement.\nCollege's chief concern is still\nmeeting the space requirements of an\nincreasing number of refectory users.\nAt the moment a new JCR is about\nas likely as a straight answer from the\nCollege Assistant Secretary.\nCamborne\nA vote to ban Camborne fixtures\nentirely would have been premature.\nTheir behaviour is probably no\ndifferent from any rowdy sports team\non tour.

    "content": "The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949\nBottle match ban threat\nCamborne School of Mines will not be invited back to Imperial\nCollege for the annual 'Bottle Match' unless their behaviour\nimproves. Monday's meeting of ICU Council decided that\nCamborne should be sent a warning, after players and\nsupporters disrupted the Union Bar and Southside Bar and\nwere believed to have vandalised toilets in the Sherfield Building\non Saturday night.\nCamborne students have a history\nof abusive behaviour and petty\nvandalism during their biannual trips\nto IC to play rugby, football, hockey\nand squash against the RSM. Two\nyears ago, after the sporting fixtures\nhad to be cancelled, Camborne caused\nseveral hundred pounds worth of\ndamage in the RSM building and in\nSouthside. This year fire hoses were\nlet off in the Union bar and in\nSouthside, which had to be closed at\n9.10pm. Later in the evening\nCamborne students tried to get into\nthe Valentines Party in the Main\nDining Hall (Sherfield). Unidentified\nintruders gained access to toilets on\nthe 4th and 5th floors where ball cocks were removed, causing flooding.\nUnion DP Jackie Peirce proposed\nto Council as part of her report, that\nCamborne students be banned from\nthe Union building and from all the\nCollege bars. She also recommended\nthat Cardiff School of Mines, who\nhave caused similar disruption in the\npast, be included in this ban. She\nadded that the cleaners had\ncomplained about the state of the\nUnion building on Monday morning.\nRSMU President Rob Perry\nstressed that the Camborne fixture\nwas one of the oldest varsity fixtures,\nand that the rowdy behaviour had not\nbeen excessive. ICU Hon Sec Dave\nColley said that the fixture had\nbrought more IC students into the\nUnion bar, rather than driving them\naway. Mineral Resources\nEngineering Dep Rep Paddy Coleman\nsuggested that to ban Camborne from\nCollege bars would be premature and\nthat ICU should work harder at\npolicing visiting students during the\nfixture. ICU President Christine Taig\nthought that IC should make it a priority to see that no IC students\nwere discouraged from using the\nUnion facilities.\nMr Perry proposed that Ms Peirce's report be am mended to read that the\n\"'Camborne and Cardiff Schools of\nMines be informed of the feelings of\nICU and how their behaviour at future\nvisits will effect subsequent fixtures.\nA further am mend ment, prepared by\nGareth Fish, added that \"failure to\nimprove behaviour at the next visit\nwill result in a withdrawal of\nreciprocal agreements.\" This\nam mend ment was accepted by Mr\nPerry and the proposal was passed.\nMs Peirce raised the issue again at\nthe Union General Meeting on\nTuesday. After further discussion,\nUGM Chairman Hugh Southey\nsuspended standing orders, thereby\npreventing a quorum call, and took\nan \"opinion vote\" from the meeting.\nOn the question of whether Camborne\nshould be banned from IC Union and\nall College bars, the 'informal\nmeeting' voted 58 for a ban, with 37\nagainst.\nPerry Como to visit IC\u2014see page 24\nNo rent this Week\nResidents of Weeks Hall voted to go\non an indefinite rent strike at a meeting on Wednesday, in an attempt\nto encourage College to repair major\ndefects in the Hall's heating and water\nsystem. The Hall has been plagued by\nproblems with the heating, resulting\nin many rooms being unbearably cold\nduring poor weather conditions, while\nothers were too hot\u2014this being\ncaused by defective heating valves.\nThe common room had also become\nvery cold, with residents taking\nblankets down with them to watch the\ntelevision.\nThe water system has also proved\nunreliable during the freezing weather\nearlier this term, with water only\nbeing available between 2am and\n9am. Fire hoses had been used against\nregulations, in attempts to flush\ntoilets. A break tank and pump which\nhad been promised last year, but still\nhad not been installed, would have\naverted this situation.\nStudents voted 44-0 in favour of a rent strike, with one abstention, on a motion to have *h~ heating and water\nsystem repair , <u.i receive a rent\nreadjustment for services not\nprovided and in con ven in ece caused.\nThe conditions for the strike were that\nall rents due would be paid into a student union holding account, and\nthat permission to pay College could\nonly come from a similarly convened\nresidents' meeting.\nResidents approached IC Union\nHon Sec Dave Colley yesterday in\norder to set up the union holding\naccount. He is currently looking into\nsetting up a suitable account for the\nrent money, which could amount to\n\u00a320 000. The precedent for this\narrangement took place when\nresidents in College accommodation\nwent on a rent strike in Spring 1974.\nOther complaints brought up at the\nmeeting were that petitions raised\nboth this year and last year had been\nignored by College. The latest still\nhad not received any comment from\nCollege Secretary John Smith. It was\nalso pointed out that first years had\nnot been informed of the steep price\nrise until after they had been offered\naccommodation in Weeks.\nCommenting on the move by\nWeeks Hall residents, Student\nAccommodation Officer, Lesley\nGillingham said that she thought a rent strike would be unproductive,\nand that College would react\nun favourably to such a move. The\nstrike is not scheduled to begin until\nnext week after a meeting to discuss\nprogress on Wednesday 26th February at 6pm. Free Friday February 20th1987 No. 764\n\n"

Maybe\nthis is why the legend of King Arthur\nhas exercised a spell over the\ncollective imaginations of western\nEurope for over one millen i a. Unfortunately debunked by tightly-trouser ed Michael Wood in his In\nSearch of... King Arthur programme,\nthe legend seems to have begun with\na petty chieftan who made war, not\non the Saxons but on fellow Celts.\nCelts fleeing to Brittany exported the\nstory of the noble king who would\nrise again from sleep to free them, and\nthe French began to write poems\nabout it all. Geoffrey of Monmouth,\na so-called historian, freely\nimprovising where solid facts ran out,\nput Arthur and his knights into a up by foster parents, is hailed as King\nof all the Britains after drawing an\nenchanted sword out of an anvil\u2014then\ngets another sword thrown to him by\nthe Lady of the Lake. Being a wise,\ngood and godly man, he drives out the\nSaxons and sets up the fellowship of\nthe Knights of the Round Table to\nprotect his kingdom, rescue damsels\nand avenge wrongs; dragon killings\nmi)\nQuietly they rode near to look\nthe treachery of Mordred (Arthur's power-crazed nephew) and Quinevere\nand Launcelot's affair. Arthur, badly\nwounded, is taken away by four\nqueens in a boat, legend saying that\nhe will rise from sleep one day to free\nBritain from foes. Whether he will\ndrive out the Vikings first (most of\nEast Scotland, Durham, Yorkshire\nand East Anglia) or the Saxons (the\nrest of England) remains to be seen.\nThe major problem with these\nknights is the sexism and class is m \u2014\nwomen lar gly get bit parts of damsels\nin distress, apart from Quinevere,\nNimue, a female magician, and the\nLady Linnet, whose voice was\nnagging rather than bird-like. Very\nfew people other than knights and\ntheir squires (squires were youth-opportunity-scheme knights) ngu re in\nthe stories at all. The magic is still\nthere however, even in the T.H. White, 12-year-old and over version\nThe Once and Future King, comprising The Sword in the Stone and\nother books, and in Mark Twain's Yankee at the Court of King Arthur,\na satire on 19th century romanticism.\nRoger Lancelyn Green has also\nwritten a good version, again for\nchildren, published by Puffin and\nimaginatively entitled King Arthur\nhistory book and from then on it was\nno holds barred.\nThe best publicity agent of all was\nSir Thomas Malory, who re-wrote the\nArthurian legend whilst stuck in\nNewgate prison for being on the\nlosing side in the War of the Roses.\nHe added a request for de live rence to\nhis epic, which was printed by\nCaxton, but nevertheless died in his\neleventh year in Newgate.\nIt is easy for us with our complex\n20th century fiction and drama, full\nof underlying metaphors and rather\nboring hidden meanings, to patron is e medieval literature as simple.\nHowever with Arthur even the themes\nare complex, the language is beautiful\nand lyrical and the characters have\nreal emotions and desires. Taken at\nface value, Arthur has all the material\nfor a good story; blood (lots of battles\nand jousts), sex (various damsels in\nsami te dresses, plus the adultery\nbetween Quinevere and Launcelot)\nand religion (the quest for the Holy\nGrail).\nThe basic plot, with variations on\nthe theme, tells how Arthur, brought\nand all loved him at once\nby appointment and giants a speciality. At the height of the glory\nof the Holy Isle of Logres (as it was\ncalled) the knights set out to find the\nGrail, the cup used by Christ at the\nlast supper. Many of the knights never\nreturned from this quest and soon\nafter the Kingdom of Logres is broken\nfor ever by the combined effects of\nand his Knights of the Round Table,\nprice \u00a32.50. If you're looking for a grown-up tome The High History of\nthe Holy Grail, published by James\nClark & Co. at \u00a36.95 is available, but\nbe warned, it contains much ancient\nand ye olde spelling. Thereupon, I lay\ndown my pen and girt my lab coat on\nme, bearing my readers farewell.\nLauncelot knocked them off their horses . . . \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Me so many nine-pins\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs FELIX, Friday February 20th198716 Picocon is the event of the year; it's the convention of the Science Fiction\nSociety of Imperial College. As the\nname suggests, it is a small\nconvention and it lasts for only twelve\nhours but during this time there will\nbe speakers, videos, quizzes, games,\nRPGs and slide shows.\nThis is the fifth Picocon held at\nImperial College. Over the past years\nwe have had many top quality\nspeakers including, for example,\nDavid Langford and Brian Stableford.\nThis year our guests of honour are\nauthor John Brunner and space artist\nDave Hardy. Both men are British\nand are highly esteemed in their\nseparate fields of work (which are\ngenerally dominated by Americans).\nJohn Brunner has written several\nbooks, mostly science fiction, and has\nwon several awards including the\nprestigious Hugo award for Stand on\nZanzibar (1968) and the Nebula\naward for The Sheep Look Up (1972).\nHe has written professionally for over\nthirty years and has contributed much\nto both the intellectual and lighter\nsides of science fiction. His talk\nshould be very entertaining and\nprovoke much discussion.\nBritain has produced a few talented\nscience fiction artists. One of the\nlatest and most noted artists is David\nHardy. Along with Patrick Moore, he\nwrote Challenge of the Stars which\nhe illustrated using a vivid sense of\nimagination and scientific accuracy.\nAs well as speaking about science\nfiction art in general, Mr Hardy will\nalso be giving a colourful slideshow.\nAs well as our guests of honour, we\nhave invited many other authors,\nscience fiction and fantasy buffs who\nshould be popping in from the real\nworld (or unreal world as the case\nmay be). After mingling with the 'rich\nand infamous' (no, I don't mean the\nWellSoc and Consoc committee\nmembers), you could join in with the\nfantasy and wargames. Hopefully, we\nshould be running Car Wars or\nParanoia and other role playing\ngames.\nThroughout the day, various video\nfilms will be shown. These will\ninclude Dark Star, The Hunger and\nScanners (especially for all you\nbloodthirsty non-vegetarians). Last\nyear, the ICSF challenged the\nCambridge Science Fiction Society to\na trial of charades and hack questions,\nwe thrashed them in one game and\nnarrowly lost another. This year our\nsuperconductivity-HAL-computer-like team intend to demonstrate their\nsuperiority with style, so come along\nand give them your support.\nRefreshments can be bought and\nwill include drinks, sandwiches and\npizzas.\nYou don't have to be a science\nfiction or fantasy hack to attend\nPicocon. The convention starts at\n10.00am and finishes at 10.00pm on\nSaturday February 21st, and is held\nin the Biology seminar rooms (old\nBot-Zoo common rooms) in Beit\nArch. Entrance will be \u00a32.50 non-members, \u00a32.00 members.\nTIMETABLE10.00 Heavy Metal\n11.30 Danger Mouse\n12.00 ICSF vs CUSFS\n1.00 Danger Mouse\n2.00 Dave Hardy Slide Show\n3.00 S.F. Music Quiz\n3.30 Dark Star\n5.00 John Brunner\n6.00 Scanners & Meal Break\n8.00 ICSF vs CUSFS\n9.00 The Hunger\nFilm Society IC Film Society's next presentation,\nthis Thursday 26th in Physics LT1\n(doors 7.30pm), is John Huston's Prizzi's Honour, starring Jack\nNicholson (Easy Rider, One Flew\nOver the Cuckoo's Nest) and Kathleen\nTurner (Bodyheat, Romancing the\nStone, Crimes of Passion).\nJohn Huston, one of Hollywood's greatest directors, who made such\nclassics as The Maltese Falcon and\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\nmanages to keep up his standards in\nPrizzi's Honour. Huston keeps on\nmaking films which are different and\nunusually cast but very entertaining\nsuch as Prizzi's Honour.\nJack Nicholson plays the enforcer\nof a Brooklyn mafia family, who falls\nhead-over-heels in love with Kathleen\nTurner, who he later finds out is a freelance contract killer. Nicholson's performance as the awestruck, slow\nbut not dumb, m afi oso is both\nbelievable and very funny. Time Out\nrecently called Kathleen Turner,\n\"Hollywood's hottest actress,\" and\nit's no understatement, you'll know\nwhy if you see Prizzi's Honour or any\nof her recent films. However Prizzi's Honour is not just a film with two big\nstars giving electric performances, it\nis also a very subtle and funny spoof\non the mafia and on mafia films. If\nyou miss this film you miss out.\nMartin Gans\n50p members, \u00a31.00 non-members,\nMicro Club Last Thursday, 15 members of Micro\nClub squashed themselves into a minibus and headed out towards\nCroydon in search of Rediffusion\nFlight Simulators. Despite mad\ndrivers and a turbocharged 2CV we\nmanaged to reach our destination only\nslightly worse for the trip. Many\nthanks to Pete Hands for agreeing to\ndrive.\nInside we were given a humourous\ntalk on the history and principles of\nsimulations including two videos of\nsome of the incredible graphics which\nare now possible. With heads still\nbuzzing of WIDE screens and sub-pixel anti-aliasing we were taken on\na tour of the shop floor.\nDon't forget the talk by Sir Clive\nSinclair on Thursday February 26th at 1.00pm in Physics LT1. The title\nis \"Sinclair Computer.\" Since the\nword is that he is about to release a new computer this should be an\ninteresting talk\nMicro Club meets every\nWednesday at 1.30pm in our club\nroom at the top of the West staircase.\nSocialist\nSociety IC Socialist Society proudly present\n\"Tony Benn MP\" on 23rd February\nin the Great Hall at 1pm. This is a Monday but I hope that as many of\nyou as possible can come. All are\nwelcome.\nTony Benn MP, the former Lord\nStansgate, is the former Labour\nEnergy Minister and is currently a member of the Labour NEC. He has\nbeen called the \"darling of the left\"\nand is a brilliant speaker. He was the\nMP for Bristol East until 1983 and has\nnow a6264 majority in Chesterfield.\nHe holds the record for the most times\nreturned to Parliament. This will\nhopefully be the best speaker meeting\nat IC this year, so please come along!\nReal Ale Society Last Wednesday Real Ale Society\nvisited Young's brewery in\nWandsworth. We were shown how\nthe brewery has developed over the\nyears, the building was originally\nbuilt on a field where sheep had been\nkept, hence the name \"Ram\nBrewery,\" and their woolly pet\n' 'Ram Rod.'' Although the company,\nwhich has a share trust scheme\nallowing employees to benefit from\nthe company's profits, has kept pace\nwith new equipment, old machines\nare preserved turning small corners\nof the building into a museum. One\ntraditional practice still used is to\ndeliver the products to local hostelries\nby horse and dray. This led to a visit\nby the Queen to see the magnificent\nhorses, but although she had been\nsurrounded by bottles of \"Ram Rod\"\nshe was refreshed with a cup of tea.\nReal Ale Society prefers to visit\nsampling rooms, which makes the rest\nof the evening interesting...\nThe regular meeting on Thursday\nwas also a success, the next one is\nThursday February 19th. STOIC Yes, the student television of Imperial\nCollege is starting transmissions again\nnext week with a debate between the\npresidential candidates. The week\nafter, we will be showing the\nHustings UGM 'Live' and you can\nsee edited highlights of the Hustings\nthe same evening. So don't miss our\nlong-awaited return to the cathode\ntubes of Imperial College. Watch the\npresidential debate, at 1.00pm and\n6.50pm next Thursday in the Union\nSnack Bar, Southside TV lounge, and\nall the campus halls.\nSTOIC\u2014Are you getting the full\npicture?\n\n"

Mr\nPhillips' persistent failure to attend\nCouncil was attacked by several\nmembers. The accounts of the Ents\nCommittee had not been made\navailable for inspection, causing\nspeculation that a large amount of\nmoney had been wasted, particularly\non the Christmas carnival.\nICU President Christine Taig\ndefended Ents' performance and\npointed out that if they had been\nmaking huge losses she would not\nhave authorised the spending of any\nmore money on entertainments. She\nwarned that Mr Phillips may resign\nif he were threatened, leaving the\nUnion with no Ents Officer.\nHowever, Council voted that if he\ndoes not attend the next Council\nmeeting, which is on March 16th, he\nshould be asked to resign anyway.\nIn reply to this decision, Mr\nPhillips has issued a letter inviting all\nCouncil members to submit questions\nto him before the 2nd of the month,\nso that he can collect all relevant\ninformation.\nBlow job\nThis year's WolfFoundation Prize in\nChemistry has been won jointly by\nProfessor David M Blow, Head of the\nBiophysics Department of Imperial\nCollege, and Professor Sir David C Phillips of Oxford.\nThey have received the award for\ntheir long term work on improved\nmethods of X ray crystallography in\norder to determine the exact three-dimensional structure of enzymes.\nProf Phillips solved the first animal\nenzyme structure in 1965, while Prof\nBlow determined the structure of a much larger enzyme in 1967.\nBy a comparison of the various\nenzymes Professor Blow also\ndemonstrated that the activity of\nenzymes is shape-dependent.\nIn 1981 Professor Blow and his\ncollaborators conducted the first\nexperiments in protein engineering,\naltering the action of enzymes by\nchanging some of their amino acid\nbuilding blocks.\nThe Foundation cites this work as\nthe key in \"transforming the\nmysteries of life into the language of\nphysical chemistry.\"\nDouble\nDutch\nThe papers for the sabbatical elections\nwere taken down by Dave Colley\n(Returning Officer), with the arrival\nof members of the Camborne School\nof Mines.

If you remember, Chris was\nplaced on a large chessboard pattern\nand had to visit every square using the\nsmallest number of tums (since he got\nan electric shock every time he made\none). Well they've done it to him\nagain. The rules this time are slightly\ndifferent. Chris has been placed on\nthe board in the top left-hand corner\nand can only escape through a door\nin the bottom right-hand corner. He\nstill gets a small electric shock every\ntime he makes a turn, but this time,\nhowever, he can't step on any of the\nblack squares, since this causes a far\nworse shock. The door will only open\nafter he has been through every white\nsquare. Obviously he can only move\ndiagonally, and, although he can\ntravel through a square more than\nonce, the door will not open if he has\ntravelled through the same corner of\na square more than once.\nSo can you find the route which\nminimise s the number of shocks that\nChris'll get and stays on the white\nsquares?

    "content": "Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday February 20th19878 Christine's Piece\nThere I was, wondering what to write\nabout in this piece. Still pondering,\nI headed towards the women's toilets\nin the Union Building and found\ninspiration on the wall, for someone\nhad written:\nCT: \"Why does nobody go to\nUGM's?\" Student: ' 'Because they 're so\ncomplete iy; totally and utterly, very,\nvery, boring!\"\nApart from the fact that I thought\na toilet wall was a fairly strange place\nto write a comment like this, it made\nme think of three questions. Why do\nwe bother with UGM's once a month\nif everyone (including me) dislikes\nthem? Whose fault is it that they're\nboring? And what could I do about it?\nquestion what Dave, Jackie and I have\nbeen doing for our money. Maybe\nnobody does have any burning issues\nto put before the student population.\nThat's fine, but the opportunity still\nhas to be there just in case...that's what comes of trying to be\ndemocratic.\nSo who makes UGM's boring? Is\nit the fault of the cumbersome rules,\nwith the inevitable procedural\nwrangling? Is it those who make\nreports, trying to give an account of\nwhat they've been doing? Is it those\nwho ask questions they think are\nimportant, or those who propose\nmotions? Or is it the poeple who don't turn up and don't make things more\ninteresting and relevant by joining in?\nProbably a combination of all these;\nFirst, UGM's aren't something that\nthe sabbaticals organise for their own\ngratification; none of us particularly\nlook forward to them. They're\nsupposed to be the opportunity for\nanyone in the Union to question or\ncriticise their officers on the work\nthey've been doing in an open forum;\nthey're also the chance for all students\nto contribute to policy or discuss\nanything they see as important with\nother students.\nMaybe nobody does want to\nbut believe me, we do try to keep\nreports brief and move onto the\npotentially interesting motions as\nquickly as possible. Unfortunately\njust when we reach a point where\nthere might be some lively debate,\nsomeone generally calls\n\"quorum\"\u2014and the whole thing\npacks up. So you see, unless plenty\nof people do go along to UGM's, they'll never get more interesting.\nSo what to do about boring\nUGM's? Short of resorting to sneaky\ntactics\u2014ie 'concocting' controversial\nissues which are guaranteed to bring\npeople along in high temper, or\noutright bribery/coe rsi on, I'm not at\nall sure. Guest speakers? Fancy\ndress? You name it? Any (serious)\nsuggestions would be more than\nwelcome.\nOf course we don't have to have\nUGM's once a month. Some people\nthink one a term would be sufficient.\nPersonally I think only reporting back\nthree times a year would be getting\naway with murder as far as sabbaticals\nare concerned\u2014but if UGM's don't improve that'll almost certainly\nhappen. Does anybody care?\nOne last gripe on this subject. If\nyou really think UGM's are boring,\nyou should try some of the two dozen\nCollege committees I sit on on your\nbehalf...but then of course that's what\nI'm here for...(Only a fool would do\nthis job, Part 7).\nAt Council last Monday some very\nserious problems came to light\nconcerning the 100 students at\nSilwood. It's a great shame that these\nstudents are so isolated and so often\nforgotten. They have no immediate\naccess to services we take for granted\nlike welfare and accommodation\nadvice; they don't even have a meeting room of their own. When\nthere is a problem at Silwood the\nrepercussions are felt heavily because\nthe student community is small and\nclose knit; and because of the lack of\nresources to turn to. I only hope we\ncan improve the spread of information\nabout Silwood over the next few\nweeks\u2014and support the Silwood\nstudents in some way when they ask\nus to do so.\nLast Chance\nI 'll be drawing names out of the hat\non February 24th to pick the lucky 2\nrecipients of a week in Sweden (see\nlast week's FELIX). Any maths,\nphysics or computing students still\ninterested, give me your name VERY\nSOON.\nFinally\nI'm sorry that these 'bits' of mine\nalways seem to end up being boring.\nI usually have wild and wacky ideas\nabout what to write sometime over the\nweekend; but when it gets round to\nWednesday morning and it has to be\nwritten NOW, it just doesn't seem to\ncome out like that, Personally I blame\nit on the education system. Still, it's probably better than thermodynamics.\nLove you all (specially everyone I forget to send Valentines to),\nChristine.\nUnion Office Due to staff shortages the office will not be open to ANYONE before11.30 pm from Monday23 rd February Reliable student required to work as\nreceptionist/cashier for the Summer\nAccommodation Centre scheme for both the\nEaster & Summer vacations.\nFor application form and other details please\ncontact Christine, room 170, Sherfield building\n(on way to Nat West bank).\nGUTTERPRESS\nTo misquote Oscar Wilde, to invite\nCamborne School of Mines to one\nevent at IC may be accounted a misfortune, to invite them to two\nsmacks of carelessness. It had been\nthe day of the Bottle Match on\nSaturday where hordes of pissed\nminers from Cornwall and London\ndescended on Southside and the\nUnion Bar for \"a few drinks\".\nBeing curious about the function of\nfire hoses, the Camborne crew\ndecided to watch its effect on the |\nPizza Bar. At this point Rob Northey\ndecided to shut the bar and kick them\nall out, whereupon they all wandered\nover to the Union Bar. Which is\nwhere Man Tai comes into the story:\nnot content with having students from\nall over Europe in his party courtesy\nof Hyde Park Relay, our spud-like\nfriend decides to tell the Camborne\nboys all about it, despite protestations\nfrom Dave \"Gutman\" Colley.\nUnable to resist a party, especially\nwhere it involves a bar extension,\nthey merrily trot down to the Main\nDining Hall to try and remove the\nmirror ball and various other bits of\nthe room in the way they do.\nOnce the Union Bar had been\ncleared of the visit ng psychos, the\nassembled bar staff and helpers set\nabout clearing up all the blood and\nother assorted nas ties. At this point\na horde of cockroaches decided to\nmake their presence known in the\nUnion Bar. Rob \"killer\" Perry was\nsingularly unimpressed with all this,\nand proceeded to set about the\nassembled insects with a carving\nknife, screaming \"I 'll get you! I 'll get\nyou!\" A few minutes later he stuck\nhis head outside the door and asked\nif they grew new heads if you cut\nthem in half. Deciding that they might\ndo, he then went on to use a metal\nashtray instead.\nCouncil at Silwood Park on\nMonday seemed to be suffering from\nan overdose of Wackosterone, as Pete\nWilson continued to berate Chairman\nHugh Southey on his rulings, to the\nextent that when Hugh called for\norder, Pete decided to challenge him\non calling order.\nGutterpress would not be complete\nwithout the traditional Joe 90 story.\nBeing a cost-conscious student, Joe\nfinds that the best solution to repairing\nhis Hillman Imp, is not to go to the\ngarage where all he will get is \"Ooh,\nyou just can't get the parts these\ndays\u2014it's the gimbal s you know. I 'll\ndo it for a pony.'' The Joe 90 solution\nis to find another car of the same\nmake, open the bonnet and take the\nrelevant part out. Quote of the week:\n\"This is the last day we are selling\norchids. You get three and they come\nin a nice plastic sheath.

FELIX, Friday February 20th19877 example, Max Born is officially\ncredited to Great Britain, although he\nwas born in Germany, was educated\nthere, and conducted his prize-winning research in Gottingen, ten\nyears before he emigrated. Similarly,\nthe physicists TD Lee and CN Yang\nare credited to China, however, both\nwere educated and did their research\nin the United States. Imperial\nCollege's favourite physicist, Erwin\nSchrodinger, whose centenary will\nshortly be celebrated here, was forced\nto flee from Austria to work in Dublin\nin the prewar years, but was credited\nto Austria. (Incidentally,\nSchfodinger's personal life caused\nraised eyebrows in staunchly Catholic\nIreland; he lived happily in a menage\na trois).\nThe Nobel Foundation also allows\nmultiple \"claiming\" of Nobel\nLaureates by academic institutions. A laureate may be claimed by the\ninstitution at which he did his\nundergraduate work, by the one at\nwhich he obtained his doctoral\ndegree, and some institutions can\neven claim a laureate if he studied\nthere without actually getting a degree. A postdoctoral year or two\nwill also suffice in most cases.\nMembership of a faculty, from\nresearch assistant to professor, can be\nrecognised as a legitimate connection.\nThe recipient's presence at an\ninstitution at the time of the award is\nanother justification for a claim to a laureate. At the end of the laureate's career, he may take a visiting\nprofessorship, bringing glory to yet\nanother seat of learning.\nAs a consequence of all this\neagerness to be associated with the\nscientific greats, situations develop\nsuch as that in the United States,\nwhere one hundred laureates are\nclaimed by nearly two hundred\ninstitutions. One extreme case, that of\nthe biochemist Fritz Lipmann, shows\nhim to be counted amongst the staff\nof eleven universities, colleges, and\ninstitutes. This somewhat farcical\nsituation is recognised as something\nof an embarrassment, and many\ninstitutions qualify their claims at\nlength. However, some compound\ntheir embarrassment. The College of\nthe City of New York has given a prize to Arthur Kornberg, its first\nalumnus to win a Nobel Prize,\nprobably the first time anyone has\nbeen awarded a prize for winning a prize. In order to contain this\nover zealousness, in some areas self-denying rules have come into force\nto limit the number of laureates\nclaimed. Harvard does not list its\nalumni laureates, nor does it count\nthose that have briefly meandered\nthrough its corridors before obtaining\ntheir prizes. The reasoning behind\nmultiple laureate claims can be seen\nin the example of the Rockerfeller\nInstitute. When one of its members\nsuggested that the institute may be\ncoasting, a member of the Board\nindignantly retorted that \"an institute\nwhich has had nine scientists win the\nNobel Prize in the last five years\ndoesn't sound to me like an institute\nthat's coasting.\"\nDepartments that are not eligible to\nreceive awards sometimes have\ntrouble getting recognition. A scientist at Harvard working in a field\nnot covered by the awards commented\nthat \" those branches of science that\nare not eligible have a hard time to\nprove that they are, perhaps, just as\ngood or even nearly as good as the\ndepartments that have laureates.\"\nSentiments that I am sure will be\nshared by many people at Imperial,\nespecially the mathematicians.\nThe preeminence of the Nobel prize\nis an interesting phenomenon. Many\nother scientific prizes boast much\nlonger histories. The Copley and\nRumford Medals of the Royal Society\nwere established in 1731 and 1800\nrespectively. The Nobel Prize, with\nan eighty-six year history, is a comparative newcomer.Nor is the\nprize money offered for the prize as\nsignificant as some. The John and\nAlice Tyler Ecology Award headed\nthe prize money stakes in 1976, while\nat that time the Nobel Prize money\nhad reached its peak of $160,000,\noften shared between several\nrecipients. Over the years the award\nhas still been sizeable enough to\nattract considerable attention. It is\npossibly the truly international flavour\nof the prize that has maintained its\nsupremacy.. Where the prize is\nunquestionably in a class of its own\nis in the selection process which\nensures that the names on the prize\ncertificates are eventually those which\nfeature most prominently in our\n>..\u2022\u201e,'j/ Iff M/'M. S. BLACKETT\nhm wmi rm adff mi day pf nt m mm m km present day text books. The prizes for\nliterature and peace are far more\nsubjective, and have frequently been\ncriticised for political and ideological\nreasons.\nThe prestige of the prize, and the\npublicity which it attracts, have lent\nlegitimacy to many ventures. On both\nsides of the Iron Curtain Nobel\nlaureates have spoken out on political\nmatters. In response to Soviet\nphysicist Andrei Sakharov's vehement condemnation of Soviet\npolitical repression, all five of the\nSoviet Union's Nobel Laureates, with\nthirty five other academics,wrote a letter to Pravda denouncing Sakharov\nas \"an instrument of hostile\npro pog and a against the Soviet\nUnion.\" Such actions might explain\nwhy the Nobel Foundation is less than\neager to bestow on Soviet scientists\nan honour given in the spirit of\nphilanthropy.\nLaureates in the United States have\nalso spoken out on political matters.\nIn 1970 four ty four laureates wrote to\nthe president asking him to bring the\nwar in Vietnam to a rapid conclusion.\nThere was some highly favourable\npublic comment on this move, to the\neffect that it was about time that the\nscientific community took a stand\ninstead of keeping a decidedly low\nprofile. However, there was some\nhighly unfavourable comment from\nother laureates, who considered this\nan entirely irresponsible political act.\nQuite clearly, scientists and others\nhave come to the opinion that the\nviews of laureates on issues outside\ntheir sphere of work carry weight not\nN OPEL FR1S WltMtfK i LUERUPPFlftiNlNCfN\nCfMtNMMT\u00bbEU>44\nABDU S5ALAM H11 tV NL CI \u00abMOW< XH J F tV TN\\ VII NBIKC\n\u2022RrfRAMKSATHtlNCMTlOllIN\nCRK'KENAP.'iV AGt X W lLI K TOP fcW CNt ft jK AVrutKltANVULWJIUMEKTAItMfmKLAR.\nmN SVA O A NfUT\u00ab\u00abA! iT*dM\\HN\nonly in science but in public affairs.\nThis may emanate from the mistaken\nbelief that anyone who can fathom out\nthe most intricate secrets of the\nuniverse is amply qualified to make\nsignificant statements on the workings\nof something as simple as the running\nof the world.\nNobel Prize laureates have become,\nnot surprisingly, a self-perpetuating\nbreed. The laureate \"family tree\"\nwhich was started by Rayleigh for his\ndiscovery of argon, is quite\nimpressive. Rayleigh worked with\nanother laureate, JJ Thomson, who in\nturn spawned a whole host of\nlaureates, including Rutherford, our\nvery own GP Thomson (JJ's son) and\nBorn to name but a few. From\nRutherford sprang up no less than\neleven other laureates. Among these\nwas another \"son of Imperial\" PMS\nBlackett, as well as Chadwick, Bohr\nand Appleton.\nThe father-son laureate relationship\nis not uncommon. Sir William Henry\nBragg and Sir William L Bragg were\nthe only father and son team ever to\nhave shared the prize (for their joint\nwork on the diffraction of electrons\nthrough crystals). Niels Bohr won the\nprize for physics in 1922. Fifty three\nyears later, his son Aage Bohr jointly\nwon the physics prize for his work on\nnon-spherical atomic nuclei. Masterstudent laureate relationships are\nendless, as previously outlined, but\nthe relationship between Nobel\nlaureates and their apprentices is often\nstormy, and academic conflict is not\nunknown. One of the more infamous\ncases was that of an eventual laureate,\nHerman Muller, and his laureate\nmaster TH Morgan. Muller observed\non Morgan, \"the great bulk of the\nfacts of real significance subsequent\nto 1911, and practically all after 1913,\nwere found by younger workers,\nquite independently of guidance from\nhim in experiments which they had\nplanned on the basis of their own\nmore advanced viewpoints. Their\nresults and interpretations were,\nhowever, later accepted by Morgan.\"\nThis type of situation has since\nacquired the tag of Morganism.\nIn the academically compete ti ve world of the laureates such instances\nare not uncommon, with young up-and-coming minds eager to assert\nthemselves in their own right, and\nmasters sometimes slow to\nacknowledge their contributions. The\npath to prize dom is not easy, as\nProfessor Wilkinson illustrates very\nwell. After working in nuclear\nchemistry at Berkley, he moved to\nMIT and inorganic chemistry. He was\nmade an assistant professor at\nHarvard in 1951 where he published\nhis first results showing the novel\n\"sandwich\" structure of the\ncompound ferrocene a year later.\nHowever, in 1956 Harvard decided,\nas Prof Wilkinson puts it himself, that\nHarvard \"could do without me,\" and\nhe was \"let go\". Our own laureate\nreturned to Blighty and received the\nprize for chemistry in 1973, for that\nvery work on sandwich compounds.\n\n"
