    "content": "Feature\nA Culture Vulture and\nthe Meat of Science\nFollowing the\npublication of his book\n'Understanding the\nPresent' three years ago,\nBryan Appleyard has\nbecome something of a cause celebr e among\nscientists; the man they\nlove to hate. Jon Jordan\nmet him at his\nBlackheath home, and\nfound a man whose\ncriticisms of science are\nsystematic of what he\nsees as a deeper malaise\n- the possible death of\nwestern culture itself...\nBy his own admission Bryan Appleyard is a writer without a genre. \"I'm always criticised\nfor being an interloper,\" he says when I ask\nabout his newest foray, a novel called 'First\nChurch of the New Millennium'. \"I'm in the\nwrong genre again, but I'm always in the\nwrong genre.\"\nOf course that could be considered par\nfor the course when you make your living as a newspaper feature writer (the Sunday Times)\nand weekly columnist (the Independent). The\nparadox of this situation, writing about things\nyou only know about because you supposed to\nbe writing about them, is something he freely\nacknowledges. \"I mean in some respects if I wasn'ta journalist maybe I wouldn't think\nabout these things but because I spend my\ntime having to write comment ... I 've got to\nactually think about what I write.\"\nSo when he ventured into that most\ndangerous of fields, popular science writing,\nfor his book 'Understanding the Presentscience and the soul of modern man' he was\nout on a limb again. In the book he aimed to\nexpose the damage he felt science was doing\nto Western society, but in actuality he\nunearthed a seething mass of vitriolic\nscientists. Appleyard laughs. \"I remember\nsaying to the publishers when they bought it\nfor a surprisingly large sum: 'I'm delighted\nyou bought it, but you're mad, it won't even\nget reviewed'.\"\nHowever the book's publication also\ncoincided with a BBC series called 'Pandora's Box' and a book by the Newcastle University\nphilosopher Mary Midgely; both of which\nwere strongly critical of aspects of modern\nscience. Scientists were particularly sensitive\nto such attacks as the Government were just\nstarting consultations for a white paper on\nscience funding. \"It was said, quite seriously\nthat I was an agent of the Tory Government\naiming to cut science funding,\" says\nAppleyard incredulously. \"It was actually\nseriously said.\"\nAnother aspect of the reaction which he\nfound surprising was the extent to which\nscientists worked as a coherent social and\nprofessional group. \"I kind of assumed that\nscientists were all discrete units and locked\naway,\" he says. \"I wasn't really talking about\nthem. I was talking about the idea of science.\nBut it turned out that they all talked to each\nother ... certainly the ones who get the\nmicrophone and publicity\". Later he found\nout that BBC producer of'Pandora's Box' had\nbeen blacklisted, with scientists telling each\nother not to appear on the programme.\n\"I was amazed,\" Appleyard recalls. \"I thought, journalists get trashed like this all\nthe time, lawyers get trashed like this all the\ntime and teachers get trashed like this all the\ntime. You know every institution is exposed\nto public trashing now and then. Scientists\ncan't take it - what's the problem?\"\nThis situation was made even more\ninteresting because at that time science had\nnever been more popular. Despite the fact\nthat no-one could read past the forty second\npage, Stephen Hawkin's' A Brief History of\nTime' had become the intellectual status\nsymbol to have on your shelf. Its best-selling\nexploits had also opened the way for the\ncomplexity of modern cosmology, the\nin de term in an cie s of quantum theory and the\nflashing patterns of chaos to be 'explained' to\nthe general public. You would have thought\nthat scientists would have felt securer.\nf FELIX28 HP R3B Feature\nIronically, the inspiration for\n'Understanding the Present' was sparked\nwhen Bryan Appleyard spent a day interviewing Stephen Hawking, just before ' A Brief History' was published.\n\"He was unnecessarily impatient about\ncertain questions,\" says Appleyard \"and it\nseemed to me that he was taking a highly\nfacile view of the philosophy of science. In\nfact he [Hawkin] says disgracefully in his\nsecond book that all philosophers of science\nare failed scientists\". A few days later he\nreturned to interview Hawkin's now ex-wife\nwho is also a devote Anglican. Bryan was\namazed to hear her say that she thought her\nhusband was doing things that he wasn't qualified to do. \" Without adopting her\nreligious perspective I sort of agreed,\" he\nrecalls. \"Later I thought 'well he is doing\nthings he isn't qualified to'.\nThis scientific over-reaching partly\nresulted from such statements as the infamous\n'knowing the mind of God' and, when linked\nwith talk of 'Unified Theories', gave the\nimpression that science was not the only truth\nin theory but would soon become the\ncomplete truth in practice.\nAs Appleyard explains: \"I just wanted\nto write a history which pointed out that\nthere was an alternative history, not a triumphal is tic history of science that had\nalways been written, but this history of\nscience which was a threat to people. Martin\nAmis called it a 'history of increasing\nhumiliation' and in some senses it is.\"\nSo is he pessimistic about our\ntechnologically driven future? \"It's much\neasier to be pessimistic if you're a journalist\ncos it's more fun,\" he starts. \"But I am\ntemperate ly pessimistic\". As readers of his\ncolumn in the Independent will be aware,\nAppleyard has switched his attention from\n'pure' science to the impact of things like\nInformation Technology. Recently he's interviewed Bill Gates of Microsoft and has\nwritten about the UK launch of the internet\nmagazine 'Wired'.\nHe talks about a techno-hippy he met\nfrom Microsoft's Advanced Consumer\nProducts Department, who was convinced\nthat their new handheld computer would\nresult in an evolutionary jump for mankind.\nWhilst Appleyard admits that the arguments\nof Gates' techno-priests are seductive, he still\nis concerned that our obsession with the new\nage of technology is out of control.\nMuch of his unease is specifically\nconcentrated on the current a historical thinking which has become associated with\nthese technologies. \"I wrote about 'Wired'\nmagazine - and those guys are mad\" he says.\nThen he stops. \" No, those guys are very\nnice!\" he laughs before continuing, \"These\nguys are Pol Pot and Year Zero. They're\nsaying there's too much history in the world;\nwe want to start again. Starting again has a very bad reputation, it used to result in a lot\nof dead bodies.\"\nMost importantly at the core of all\nAppleyard's arguments is the view that\nWestern civilisation and culture are\nsomething worthy of being defended.\n\"Although I'm dubious about the West's capacity to cope with technological\ndevelopment, I'm not anti the western\ntradition\", he remarks. \"I'm very much pro\nthe western tradition.\"\nAs he writes at the end of the column\nconcerning 'Wired' magazine: \"The danger of\nthe technocrat's Year Zero is the same as\nevery other. It lies in the hubris tic belief that\nhistory is a mess and ought to be forgotten.\nBut however bad the machine-age world is, it\nis not as bad as it might be, precisely because\nwe remembered history.\" Q Titbits\nCinema Violence\n\"Hilariously, the British censors have\nbeen in such a quandary about this\nfilm [Natural Born Killers] that they\nhave invited Stone over to London to\njustify his work. Perhaps they should\nalso stipulate that he should turn up\nat every performance to explain his\nhigher motives in case audiences\nleave the cinema labour ing under the\nPhilistine misconception that his film\nwas just bloody good fun.\"\nWestern Idealism\n\"It's like the argument that we ran\nthe slave trade. Actually the Africans\nand the Arabs ran the slave trade, we\nstopped it. I don't want the anti-science view to be taken as an anti-Western view.\"\nPrince Charles\nInstead of trying to build tacky\npseudo-villages he should train as an\narchitect. Instead of visiting Bengalis\nin the East End, he should be running\ntheir textile factories. Instead of\nhanding out money 'to the\ncommunity' he should be finding out\nhow it is made in the City, in Tyneside\nor, after learning Japanese, in Tokyo.\nWhy not? He has nothing else to do.\nThe supposedly 'hectic' life of royalty\nis a comfortable lie...\"\nthe Origins of\nEnvironmentalism\n\"[In the Sixties] Environmentalism\nfilled the psychological vacuum\ncreated by the twin feelings of\nimpotence and mistrust. It gave\npeople something to do and a way of\nthinking that would express their\ndisappointment and fear. At its worst\nit emerged as sanctimoniously radical\npolitics; at its best it freed people of\nthe dangerous illusion that they could\ndo what they liked\"\n2\n8\nA PB9S FELIX1 "

    "content": "News in Brief\nNews\nThe annual Inter-Continental Varsity Championships were held over the Easter break, writes Bryan Crotaz, and the\nImperial College Dance Club excelled themselves. Whilst individual couples won many trophies throughout the week it\nwas in the three team competitions that brought them greatest success. IC won first prizes in the best Student Team\nMatch and, surprisingly, the American Style Team Match - which involved competing against teams from across the\nUSA! Finally, to complete their hat-trick, they dressed up in monkey and elephant costumes and scooped the remaining\nfirst prize, the Cabaret Team Match. With the heat in the costumes reaching a more than uncomfortable level, one\nmember commented \"Anyone who doesn't think dancing is athletic should try that one!\"\nNaked Pride Over Exposed\nBY JON JORDAN The less reputable side of\nImperial's reputation has been\nfurther enhanced recently with a display of 'national pride' in Southside bar.\nThe incident in question\noccurred on the 23rd of March,\nthe last Thursday of the spring\nterm. Two men climbed onto a table and proceeded to remove\ntheir clothing, leading to a display of genitalia whilst the\nnational anthem was being sung\nby their companions. Following\nthis, a complaint was made by\nCaroline Garaway, a female\nresearch student, to the Southside Bar Manager, Mr Roger\nPownall, and also circulated to\nthe Student's Union and FELIX( see Incoming on page 5).\nMr Pownall was on duty the\nnight of the incident. He claimed\n(Smash & Carry continues)\naround the department the\nprevious Friday, the student, who\nhad already lost one computer,\nconfronted and pursued the two\nthieves.\nIncredibly one of the thieves\nmanaged to escape by the same\nroute through the ground floor\nmain ten ace area that had been\nJlTM FELIX28 APR9 S that there was little the staff\ncould have done to halt\nproceedings because 'by the time\nyou get there it's over'. However,\nthe two individuals concerned\nwere asked to leave the bar (they\nwere judged to be in a drunken\nstate and it is illegal to serve\ndrunk customers) and told to\ncome back the following day\nwhen they had sobered up. \"They\napologised and said it wouldn't happen again\" said Pownall.\nWhen asked if this sort of thing\nwas a regular occurrence, he\nreplied \"it's the first time it's happened for eighteen months\".\nLucy Cho thi a, ICU President, said that it is Union policy that people are not allowed\nto strip in public places and that\nthey \"wouldn't get away with it\naround here [the Union bar]\".\nMuch of the problem seems\nto stem from the initiation used earlier that week. In both\nraids it is believed that this was\nthe criminals' method of entry to\nthe building and that the raiders\nhad planned to use this as their\nmeans of escape.\nThe second criminal was\nchased to the Security Lodge at\nthe front door of the Huxley Building where the female\nceremonies practised by the\ndrinking clubs of the Constituent\nCollege Unions. Sources have\ntold FELIX that the incident in\nquestion was a' Links' Club\ninitiation. Links is the official\ndrinking club of the City &\nGuilds College Union.\nAnother episode last term\nagain saw naked Linksmen on\nthe loose, this time in Beit Quad.\nThe so-called 'quad run' broke\nthe rules laid down by the Union\nas the in it i ants failed to keep\ntheir boxer shorts on, nor were\nthe Union and the Biology\nDepartment aware that it was\ngoing to take place. In the\ncircumstances this proved\nunfortunate as Biology had an\nadmissions day at the same time.\nThe effect on the prospective\nstudents, some of whom had\ntheir parents with them, is not\nknown.\nsecurity guard called for\nimmediate backup.\nIn the few minutes before\nextra person el arrived, the\nintruder managed to break open\nthe double front doors of the\ndepartment, which had previously appeared to be locked, and\nto make his escape out onto\nQueensgate.\nRector's Reward\nFollowing the recent drop in IC's funding ( FELIX1023) the\nRector, Professor Sir Ron Oxburgh, has declined to follow\nthe Vice Chancellor of\nManchester University's lead\nwho insisted that his shortfall\nwould not result in any staff\nredundancies. While emphasising that he did not 'for see' any\nlayoffs Prof Oxburgh said that he\n\"could not possibly responsibly\ngive such an undertaking\".\nSpeaking to FELIX the\nRector seemed at ease with a recent survey of college heads'\nsalaries which placed him in13 th position. He pointed out\nthat in assuming his present role,\nwhich sees him presiding over a budget of \u00a3165M, he had taken a wage cut. Sir Ronald suggested\nthat following the expected\nmedical merger there may be as\nmany as thirty or forty college\nemployees earning more than\nhim.\nCrime Prevention Week\nBurglars beware. Imperial\nCollege's Crime Prevention\nWeek begins on Monday. The\nregular bi-annual event has run\nfor the past ten years and, says\nLocal Community Officer PC Clive Coleman, is always well\nattended.\nThe Week centres on a display in the Sherfield Building\nAnte Room. It will incorporate\nadvice stalls, crime prevention\ninformation and also free cycle\ncoding. The display will be\nmanned from Monday, 1st May\nto Friday, 5th May from 10am to\n4pm. PC Coleman believes the\ninformation available will appeal\nboth to staff and students alike.\n\"We give good advice to students\n- we can give advice on property\nmarking, personal security and\nmore,\" he told FELIX. Further\ninformation is available from\nSherfield Security or from Clive\nhimself on: 0171-321 6920.\nTelevision Awards\nSTOIC, Imperial's own Student\nTelevision station, had good\ncause to celebrate with the news\nthat it had picked up two prizes\nin the National Association of\n(continued overleaf)\n\n"

    "content": "A trip to Harlington\nKeys: Fast, Furious, Fluid\nThursday 2nd March was a day of learning.\nLearning that just because a hovercraft part\nhas been working well for so long that you\nforget what it looks like, it doesn't mean that\nit won't break/go wrong/collapse exactly\nwhen you don't want it to. Of course, if you\nare going to have one problem, why not have\nthem all?\nWell the hovercraft (god bless it) bore\nthis in mind on that day, and even managed\nto swing it so that the weather turned from\nsun to sleet by the end of the day.\nUnperturbed by this lack of co-operation\nfrom the craft, the die hard hover c lubbers invested in their loss and returned to\nHarlington sports ground one week later with\na vaguely modified craft, a large toolbox and\nprayer mats. This outing was a different story\nthough. The hover behaved impeccably and\nallowed four hours of trouble free flying.\nThe afternoon started with the novice\npilots taking the craft out for a spin around\nthe thankfully huge expanse of the sports\nground and when a bit of confidence and a marginal idea of control had been built up, a slalom course was next on the agenda. In turn\nthis was followed by two times' laps of a figure of eight circuit. As the red mist\ndescended on the drivers during the last\nevent, the cones were shown no mercy. Some\nwent over, some went under and a few even\nstayed standing.\nThroughout the day, the hover seemed\neasily capable of its 40 mph top speed which\nmay not sound so fast, but when you are\nskimming along at about 20cm above the\nground with a brutally modified motorbike\nf FELIX28 RP R9B engine screaming its tits off behind you, no\nbalanced person would say it was slow.\nI could make claims that hover crafting\nwill enrich your life, will help you pass your\nexams and could well contribute to world\nharmony through the great spirit associated\nwith it, but all of those would be lies. The\ntruth is that it is excellent fun and a great way\nto spend an afternoon.\nHoverclub meets every Wednesday in Old\nChemistry (through the grey doors as though you\nwere going to the lecture theatre, it's straight in\nfront of you). \u00a9Q(g Changing of the Guard\nKeys: Election, 37%, Committee\nThe annual Overseas Students' Committee\nelections are going to take place on\nWednesday, 3rd of May in the Union Lounge\n(ground floor union building) at 13:00pm. The elected officers will be running the OSC\nfor the academic year 1995/6. The OSC is a major Subcommittee of Imperial College\nUnion and deals with the 37% of the student\npopulation that is of non-British origin. The\njob of the OSC is to protect and promote the\ninterests of all the international students, to\ncoordinate the running of the individual\nsocieties and to represent the students to the\ndecision-making bodies of the College and\nUnion. The goals of the OSC are achieved in\na variety of ways which include the\norganisation of social events such as the\nInternational Night. The overseas students of\nIC are directly affected by the decisions of the\nOSC so it is in your interests to come and\nvote this Wednesday. If you are interested in\nrunning for any of the posts listed below you\ncan sign up on the candidate papers which\nare up on the OS C notice board on the\nSherfield Walkway. You can contact the\npeople that have been doing the jobs this year\nand they will be more than happy to explain\ntheir duties to you. The posts are:\n1) Chairman; The chairman has the\nultimate responsibility of representing the\ninternational students of IC to the Union and\nthe College. This is achieved by sitting on\nvarious College committees and most of the\nUnion decision making bodies and liaising\nwith the Union Sabbaticals and College Staff\nincluding the Rector, Pro-Rector and\nRegistrar. The chairman also has the control\nof the OSC executive committee, runs the\nmeetings and delegates jobs to the OS C officers.

So does\nthe question of baring your pasty\nall to the waiting world this\nsummer.\nApart from finding discrete\ncorners of Hyde Park in which to\ntoast your limbs, the next big\nproblem is hair. Isn't it strange\nhow fashions change. When i was\nyounger, i'm sure that hairy chests\nwere considered the macho thang\n- and bald heads despicable.\nThese days, presumably alongside\nthe cult of minimalism, no hair\nanywhere, is seen to be the goal. I have hunted high and low on this\none (being a fair skinned maid but\ndark of head) and found that by\nfar the cheapest and the best of\nministering angels is nicole\nfenton.\nConsidering that the chosen\nperson will regularly see you semi-naked and hairy, it is above all\nelse essential that they are\nfriendly, able to keep a straight\nface and possess no hidden\ncameras. Nicole combines all\nthree of these skills with the\ncheapest prices in SW London, a great sense of humour and a realistic understanding of the\nstudent budget. As required, she\nhas become one of my better\nfriends, not least because she\ndoes a better job than any one\nelse who's had the pleasure of\nripping the hair from my legs.\nWith correct after care, waxing has\nthe best effect; re-growth is\nthinner, sparser and slow. After\nthe first time it doesn't hurt, and\nleaves none of the sliced up flesh\nso commonly found floating in the\nbath after shaving. Nicole is\ntrained in everything from\nelectrolysis through massage to\naromatherapy - and, more\nimportantly, is highly unlikely to\ncall you 'Dahling'.\nPrices are from \u00a3 1 2 for a facial; \u00a324 for full leg, underarm\nand bikini; or just \u00a36 for waxing to\nthe knee. All of these prices will\nhave 1 0% deducted on production\nof your student card. The average\nmassage is \u00a312.50 and lasts half\nan hour.\nFor any men tempted to\nsuccumb to popular hair density\nnorms, do first remember that the\nsexiest man in films has a balding\nhead and an undeniably hairy\nchest. May Sean Connery continue\nto be the model for you all.\u00a9\nnicole fenton, of partners hair\nsalon, 7 la kensington church st.\nFELIX28 H PR95 THE menu o0 Just reach out and run your hand down the nearest naked\nleg.

    "content": "Phoenix BHH\nThe Joys of SelfImmolation\n(BLACK EYE\nLINER)\nYou are watching the way he dances, the\nway he moves on the floor. At a glance he\ncould be like any other, but there is\nsomething that makes him stand out.\nMaybe the purity of his movements,\nmaybe the pale, taut skin that is stretched\ntoo tightly across his face, or the lank hair\nthat he sweeps back repeatedly to remove\nit from his forehead. Mostly though it is\nhis eyes. They are staring too fixedly\nahead, not registering anything apart from\nthe lights, and that demented brain in the\ncorner. They are a pale blue, bright, and\nunderscored by a thick black eyeliner\npencil. He is moving, shifting to the heavy\npulse of the music in an unnerving ly prefect manner. Sweeping his sweaty hair\nfrom his underlined eyes, his movement\nbecomes part of the dance.\n(THE RAVE\nETHOS)\nRave music is a spiritual thing. Those sad\ncrowds who j udder and sway on ec stacy and bad acid, loving and claiming to live,\nknow nothing about it. The dance is a sacrament. They knew that back in the\ndecade before the E heads appropriated\nthe music and debased it. Their clouded\nthoughts are nothing, worthless words.\nThe rhythm is all important, the\nrepetition is the tool for ascension. When\nyou start to dance, you start to move, your\nbody is focussing on the basic rhythm, the\nthump-thump-thump of the bass. This is\nthe bottom line, holding everything\ntogether. As you get with it, your mind\ntunes into the higher layers, the snares\nand high hats, and then the bleep riffs.\nEach layer of music makes the dance more\ncomplex, and the focus of the mind rises\nhigher. This happens with all music, but\nthe beauty of rave music is that there is\nnothing at the top. No lyrics, no melody.\nNo focus. So when you reach the highest\npoint in the music, you leave. This is the\nmoment of transcendence. There is no\nmusic, no body, no mind. That is what it's all about, that pure spiritual high. Of course, there are those fuck-off blinding\nstrobes as well, but they're a different\nstory.\n(STARING AT\nTHE BRAIN)\nYou watch him staring at that insane\nbrain in the corner of the room. A huge\nplastic thing, translucent and packed\nchock full of strobe lights. The whole\nthing throbs epileptic ally above the floor,\na giant neural spasm. He can feel the\nrhythm shaking through his body,\ndrumming against his limbs and driving\nhim faster. All he can see is that brain, and\nall he can feel is the endless twitch of his\nmuscles as they echo the sounds in his\nhead. There is nothing there for him except the beat, and it is dragging him faster into itself. He jerks his arms faster\nand pumps his legs, moving 'cos that's all\nthat he has left. The sweat is streaming\ndown his face. He keeps wiping the sweat\naway, but it is pouring out of his body. He\nscrapes his hand across his forehead as he\ndances, but something makes him hold it\nsteady. The colour.\n(BLEEDING\nHEARTS)\nHe thinks momentarily, thinking that his\neyeliner is dripping. In the flash of the\nstrobe his hand, dripping with sticky\nsweat, looks red, deep scarlet. He keeps\ndancing, just dancing, and looking at his\nhand in the flicker of the strobes. It is\nblood, he sees, blood flooding out through\nthe skin. Leaking from the pores. The\nrhythm hits him even louder, and he\npushes his body hard. The ruby flow\nstreams down his cheeks, through his pale\nlips. The blood glows in the harsh\nchemical glare. Beneath his clothes he can\nfeel the clinging stickiness, the heat of the\nfluid seeping out. It drips into his eyes,\nand those strobes glow pink. The music is\nthere, and he moves.\n(BURNOUT)\nIt is too hot, the floor is beginning to\nroast, but he keeps on moving. The beat is\nalways there, relentless. The epileptic\nbrain is flashing brighter, dazzling him,\nthe strobes taking over his blood-leaked\nvisual field. It is pounding him, blinding\nhis eyes with sun borne heat. He shuts\nthem blind, feeling the burning temperature behind his lids. Raising his\nhands with the sub-bass, the flames arch\nout. His black eyeliner is scorched in the\nflow. A sudden ball of fire envelopes his\nbody, and then dies. The crowd forms a circle around the flames as they subside,\nwatching a curl of black ash dance in the\nlight of the demented brain\nphoenix..

    "content": "Incoming\nDoors... Club Guide... Punters Strip... The FELIX letters page? ^\nQQ QQ m Union's Door\nPolicy\nDear Editor,\nI would like to clear up the\nconfusion amongst some of our\nstudents regarding the right of\nadmission to the Union Building on\na Friday night and the reason that,\non occasion, we have to refuse\nentry.\nThe Local Authority Fire Officer\nsets an official limit on the\nnumbers using buildings. This is\nbased on the size of the area,\nwidth of stairs, number of fire exits\netc. Three years ago, after\nconsultation with the police, the\nUnion decided that it would NOT\noperate a 'one in, one out policy'.\nThis was agreed in order to reduce\nthe risk of our students disturbing\nlocal residents or causing a nuisance by having late night\nqueues in Prince Consort Road. It\nalso reduces the risk of outsiders\nseeing a queue and trying to get\ninto, what is, a Private Event.\nThe bottom line is - once we\nare up to capacity - that's it for the\nnight.\nIf the Union wishes to continue\nto be allowed bar extensions we\nmust maintain our good\nrelationship with local residents.\nThis, of course, includes those\nliving in Beit Hall. Anyone using\nthe Union Building must respect\nthe needs of those living in Beit\nHall and the surrounding area by\nminim ising noise when entering or\nleaving the building.\nWe are trying to offer the best,\nvalue for money, night out in\nLondon. To enable you to carry on\ngetting this we would advise you\nthat:\n1: To guarantee that you get in\non a Friday night - get here early.\n2: Should you be refused\nentrance - either because we have\nreached capacity or because you\nare deemed to have drunk too\nmuch - (it is a legal requirement\nthat we refuse entry to anyone we\n'believe' to be drunk) please leave\nthe area as quickly and quietly as\npossible.\n3. Don't jeo pardi se the license\nby disturbing local residents either\nbefore, during or after an event.\nRemember - we want to\nentertain you in a safe, happy\nenvironment but we can't do it\nwithout your help. We should think\nof others while we are enjoying\nourselves.\nMark\nEvents & Publicity Manager\nIt seems a shame that one area\nwhere the Union is successfully\nreaching a lot of students should\nbecome a victim of its own success.\nSafety obviously must come first,\nbut the downside is that perhaps\npeople are dissuaded from\nattending the Union at all, thinking:\n'well, we won't get in anyway';\nmaybe this was the reason for the\nnon-sellout attendance on the last\nday of last term? I guess what we\nneed is a big multi-sectioned venue,\nthat can be closed off as necessary.\nBut the residents are a different\nproblem. It's obviously easier to\ncater for 7500 students of an\nevening out in the wilderness\nsomewhere than it is at IC, with our\n'residents'.

I don't know if this is something you are\ninterested in following up, but I thought I'd let you know about the\nsituation. A bit of bad publicity\nmight go a long way or might at\nleast make some people think\nabout the consequences of their\nactions - or is this hoping for too\nmuch?\nYours faithfully,\nCaroline Garaway\n(Phd Research Student)\n[letter follows]\nThe Manager\nSouthside Bar\nDear Sir/ Madam,\nI am writing to express my\ndeepest disgust for activities\noccurring in Southside Bar on\nThursday 24th March between\n6pm&7 pm. Whilst sitting with\ncolleagues for a drink after work,\ntwo male students stood up on the\ntable 5 yards away from me,\ndropped their trousers and pants,\nand proceeded to parade their\ngenitalia around to everyone in the\nbar for the duration of the national\nanthem that was being sung\naround them. My colleagues\n(male&female) and I found this\nboth distressing & degrading. What\nmade the situation worse was that\nthose working in the bar did\nnothing to stop the activity and in\nfact I had the impression they\nthought it was both acceptable &\nentertaining. I'm afraid I didn't.I have never made a formal\ncomplaint about anything in my\nlife and having been in a University establishment for many\nyears now, am well used to the\nobnoxious behaviour of groups of\nsportsmen after matches. This,\nhowever, went to far. I would like\nto know why such behaviour,\nwhich would result in arrest and\ncriminal prosecution anywhere else\nin the UK, is apparently condoned\nin Southside Bar. I trust that you\nwill look into this matter urgently &\ntake steps to prevent it happening\nin the future. I would like to think\nthat standards at IC are not above\nthe criminal and, after all, why\nshould the majority of drinkers at\nthe Southside Bar just have to put\nup with it?\nYours faithfully,\nCaroline Garaway\n(PhD Research Student)\ncc The Student Union President\nFelix Editor\nCaro//ne, where have you been?\nThis is, I 've been told, an IC MAN at\nhis finest.

This year the show is\nGilbert & Sullivans' 'Yeomen of the Guard'\nand a cracking show it promises to be as well.\nFollowing the recent success of the college\nproduction 'Cabaret', it is hoped that all\nfamiliar faces, along with a lot of new ones,\nwill be around once more. Ellis Pike\n(Director) is an old hand and has worked\nprofessionally in the theatre world for some\nyears, so we're in safe hands.\nThe show runs for ten performances\nstaged in Budleight Salterton, Devon. Budleigh is a sleepy seaside town for most of\nthe year but wakes up (funny old thing) when\nthe Imperial crowd hit town. With one\nperformance a day it becomes a fun holiday\nwith friends rather than the ordeal that\nrunning a fringe venue in Edinburgh for the\nsummer can be. There's plenty of time for\npicnics, horse riding, drinking, beach\nbarbecues, drinking, watersports and more\n(drinking, say).\nSo if you want to 'do some theatre' this\nsummer, and no-one else can help... get\nyourself down to the sing-through of audition\npieces on Monday 1st May in the Union Concert Hall from 7.30pm. The auditions\nthemselves will be held during the following\nSunday (the 7th) again in the Concert Hall.\nFor more information contact Darren\nHolmes, Chemistry or email d. holmes@ic.ac.uk.\n3.DQ.Q8\nNo play makes for a dull life\nKeys: Play, Play, Play\nSo, here we are in the final term. This is\nprobably the only time I can guarantee that\nanyone actually reads this bit! I remember\nthose days when anything was better than\nrevising. But it's a necessary evil I suppose.\nAnyway, here's our little Ents' bit for those of\nyou who believe all work and no play makes\nfor a dull life...\nMonday: As the season gets to that nail-biting stage (especially for Palace and\nHammers fans) it's kick off. A night of\npremiership football live on DaVincis' big\nscreen.\nTuesday: The first of our three special\ntrivia nights with \u00a350 cash as first prize and\ntotally free entry. Starts 8pm. Wednesday: Proving that a little bit of\nwhat you fancy can do you good - the return\nof Club Spanque, if in a slightly truncated\nform - for this term we'll be running 8-midnight only. But it's still four hours of top\nfun and it's free!\nThursday: Elegance and sophistication\nin Da Vinci's as we keep on keeping on with\nour ever popular Cocktail nights.\nFriday: With the help of those very nice\npeople at Beatwax we're proud to present the\nfirst of our three special promotional events\nthis term. So get on your sharp suits for the\nPulp Fiction Promotion night. We'll be\ngiving away T shirts, copies of the\nscreenplay, posters etc and we'll be following\nthis with our usual Friday disco 'til 2pm( bar\nlam). The Pulp Fiction giveaways start at\n8pm, admission is free before 9pm, \u00a31 after.\nSo that's this week, but here's an early\nplug for those special events for the term, so\nwatch out for; Friday May 12th, Elixir - a night dedicated purely to pumping house\nand banging techno with special Ministry of\nSounds freebies. Friday May 19th; Bust-a Gut comedy - the Winners of the Southern\nOpen Mic competitions battle it out for a place in comedy's hall of fame with a very\nspecial guest com per e.

We're giving the Concert Hall over to\nWhirl-Y Gig (thanks to the cooperation of\nDramsoc), the UD H is going to become a cocktail bar, with a selection of chilled out\nDJ's playing ambient, dub, trip hop and\ngenerally mellow tunes, the Ents Lounge is\ngoing to be a foam-filled handbag & party\nheaven.

    "content": "The Student Newspaper of Imperial College Nol026 28APR95 Smash and Carry\nDoC hit four times since Christmas\nBY ANDREW SMITH With the paint not yet dry on\nrepairs made after a previous\nattack, Imperial College's Department of Computing was stunned\nby two further organised raids on\nthe Huxley Building over Easter.\nFollowing the plundering of\nComputing in the early hours of\nWednesday the 5th April, a man\nwas arrested on Exhibition Road\nand is currently out on bail. In\nthe other raid on Sunday the 9th April, one of the criminals was\npursued by a female security\nguard and a PhD student, but\nmanaged to escape after breaking\ndown a door.\nThe damage has been\nestimated at around \u00a370,000 for\nthe first and more serious raid, in\nwhich at least two male suspects\ngained entry to the building through the maintenance area on\nthe ground floor. Twenty four\ndoors on the fourth floor in the\nHuxley Building were broken,\nmany only having been fully\nrepaired the previous day by\nworkmen.\nThe apparent coincidence of\nrepair work completing on one\nday and a comprehensive pill aging taking place immediately\nafterwards has prompted some to\npoint to an 'inside job'. This theory has been discounted by\nboth Terry Briley, Deputy Head\nof Security, and Jim Murphy, Head of the Computing Support\nGroup.\nMr Murphy suggested that\nwhile the thieves were 'clearly\nwell informed', their damage\nthroughout the floor indicated\nthat 'no selectivity' was involved.\nThe thieves got away with a total\nof eleven systems, including eight highly valuable Power\nMackintoshes. Six had been\nreplaced only two weeks before.\nThe previous raid was by a gang\nwell known to police to target a number of London Colleges.\nIt is estimated that almost\n\u00a3250,000 worth of computer\nequipment has been stolen\nrecently from London educational institutions including\nBirkbeck and King's Colleges,\nCity University and the London\nSchool of Economics. With many\nof London's Computing Departments sharing a common\ninsurance policy, Imperial\nCollege's Computer Department\nis about to spend up to \u00a330,000 to\nboost the security on Level 4 of\ntheir building.\nFELIX has learnt that the\ndepartment is considering the\nuse of so-called Fibre Loops as\nwell as passive Infra Red\nDetectors, Microwave Detectors\nand Video Cameras in an attempt\nto secure every office on Level 4\nand to keep both their insurers\nand College happy. The funding\nneeded for this is expected to be\nspread over two year's budgets,\nwith money likely to come from\nthe department's own Security,\nContingency and Refurbishment\nBudgets as well as Imperial\nCollege's Contingency Budget.\nWith the department's insurance covering the loss of\nequipment it appears unlikely\nthat procurement plans for future\nBill Goodwin, former FELIX editor and now freelance journalist, is\nchallenging English Law in the European Court of Human Rights this we\nwrites Andy Sinharay. His is a test case which may force the British\nGovernment to change the law to give journalists' sources greater prot\nBill had been a trainee with the trade paper 'The Engineer', when h received classified information regarding the alleged financial problem\nTetra Ltd, a private company. Tetra then asked him to identify his sour\norder to sue for breach of confidence, but Mr Goodwin refused. He was fo\nguilty of contempt of court and fined \u00a35000, telling FELIX that he ha\nescaped a possible jailing 'because of the publicity'. Now backed by th\nNational Union of Journalists and other organisations, Mr Goodwin ha\nbrought a case to the European Court. He argues that English Law vio\nthe European Human Rights Convention by threatening Journalists wi\nfines and imprisonment for keeping their sources secret. Representin\nGoodwin, Geoffrey Robertson QC argued that this was \"obnoxious\nsociety\". As FELIX was going to press no judgement had been given.\nequipment will be affected by\nthese latest raids. Increasing\nlevels of security may however\nthreaten to student access to\nfacilities. Mr Murphy emphasised that a balance between\ndefence against criminals and\ncomputer availability for\nstudents has always been striven\nfor.\nThe present 24 hour access\nfor postgraduate students is 'kept\nunder review' but at this point\nthe department would like to\nkeep entry 'as is'. Student access\nmay have to be looked at again in\nfuture if suggestions that ram\nraids and the use of power drills\nto assault college buildings prove\ncorrect.\nIn the second of the raids the\nintruders might have wrought\nequally serious damage but for\nthe vigilance of a postgraduate\nstudent who was working in the\nbuilding at the time.

    "content": "Standby\nQ vocal\noutbreak\nTackling bach's mass in b minor\nis a major challenge for any choir\nof young voices, but at the end of\nlast term Eric Brown's choice of his\nfavourite choral work, performed\nby the ic choir, paid off.\nThe choir had obviously\nworked hard and for the most part\nknew the piece well. The balance\nwas generally good, although at\ntimes in the five part choruses, the\ntwo soprano lines struggled\nagainst the stronger sections. The\nensemble was also very good,\ndespite the tendency of both male\nparts to rush their tricky quaver\npassages. However the 'et\nre sur rex it' was sung with panache\nand commendable accuracy by the\ntenors and basses.\nThe conductor successfully\nmoulded the orchestra, led for the\nfirst time by Maya Iwabuchi, into a cohesive ensemble in spite of their\nrehearsal time constraints.\nIwabuchi gave a virtuoso performance in her solo parts, matched by\nequally sparkling renditions from\nthe oboes d 'amore, flutes and\ntrumpet. The orchestra's sound\nhowever, was marred in some\npassages by the poor tuning of the\norgan and harpsichord.\nAmongst the vocal soloists\nFrances Jellard must be congratulated for creditable singing\ndespite standing in at short notice,\nand William Purefoy's purity of\ntone once agin made him the\ndarling of the choir's sopranos\nand altos.\nBrown introduced several\nthoughtful tempi throughout the\nwork. The finale, 'dona nobis',\nwas a touch too slow for the choir\nto produce the sos tenu to required\nto communicate the full intensity\nof the movement at the end of a long and ar dous concert. However\nthe choir once again proved\nthemselves to be one of the finest\nstudent choirs with a great\nperformance of possibly the\ngreatest choral work. \u00a9\n\u00a9 monkey business\nIn a nutshell, outbreak goes like\nthis: Army doctor discovers lethal\nnew virus in darkest Africa, virus is\nwritten off as non-threatening by\nhis superiors, virus arrives in the\nStates and starts laying people out\nleft right and centre, doctor\ndiscovers that military have ulterior\nmotives...\nWhich bring us to the main\nproblem. Outbreak doesn't know\nwhat it wants to be; a comedy or an\naction movie, an ordinary thriller or\namoral ising crusade. It could have\nbeen an edge-of-the-seat race\nagainst time but it took too long to\nget started. If could have been a human interest story but it wasn't. Instead, it tried to be funny,\nwhich seems a little out-of-place in\na movie about imminent disaster. It\ntried to give us a little character\ndetail (the two doctors are ex-husband and wife, and working for\ncompeting organisations), but that\nwas about all. It tried to be a parable about military secrecy and\nparanoia, but it wasn't anything we\nhaven't seen or heard before. But\nmost of all, this film fails because\nwhen push comes to shove it's really nothing more than a vehicle\nfor its stars. That said, there are\nsome reasonably good performances from the main cast, most\nnotably from Dona/d Sutherland as\nthe coldly remorseless general,\nembodying the ruthless military\nestablishment.\nMorgan Freeman turns in a typecast heroic 'do-the-right-thing'\nperformance, which is a pity as he's an actor of some quality. Dusfin\nHoffman was ok, I guess, but how\nmuch talent does it take to act the\nadrenal is ed sh outer? The film really contains too\nlittle of everything to be much of\nanything. In the end, a film which\ncould have been so many things got\nwatered down like a homeopathic\nremedy and left us with nothing.\nIt's a strange phenomenon.\nJust as our marriages are self\ndestructing with increasing\nregularity so their cine mythical properties seem to become ever\nmore potent. Still despite the\nominous ness of its title, muriel's wedding is more a case of life\nbeing all around rather than the\nhearts and honeymoons currently\nbeing conjured up by Hugh Grant\nand his ilk.\nSqueezed beneath all that\nwhite lace trappings is an old\nfashioned and, in parts, very funny\nrites of passage movie; young\ns lobby duckling gets out of dull\nditch water home, meets up with\nfellow outsider and hits the big city\nin search of a better life. However\nafter that point Muriel's Wedding\ntakes a sharp downward spiral into\ndepression, leaving the audience\nfeeling emotionally pole axed. Maybe it just demonstrates the\nschizophrenic closeness of making\nthem laugh, making them cry.\nEither way, it's a happy-sad\nrollercoaster.\nA painful unfolding of lascivious desires and sordid secrets,\nexotic a intertwine with a Pulp\nFiction-esque precision. The title\nitself is a superlative worthy of the\nfilm's sleazy down-town jungle-themed strip club. It's not so much a poignant parable as a forlorn tale\nof lonely souls, basking in the\ngloom of their solitary existence.\nFrancis Brown (Bruce Greenwood), has lost his family in a series\nof unfortunate tragedies. His\ndaughter was murdered, a year\nlater his wife died in an accident in\na car which was being driven by his\nbrother, her lover! Twisted enough\nyet? The only escape from reality he\nhas left is Exotica. There, Christina\n(Mia Krishner), Francis' favourite\ndancer, plays the not-so-innocent\nschool girl, incarnating his fantasy\nof his deceased daughter.\nDirector, Atom Egoyan manages to enchant an atmosphere\nwhich sticks the film together but\none can't help but feel that it was\ndone for the sake of the box office\nrather than any statement about\nsuch bizarre relationships.

To start\nstrongly the captain and the\nvice-captain decided to open\nthe batting. They were both\nout without scoring!

    "content": "News\nChaplain Ascends\n| YJ ON JORDAN Imperial College chaplain Paul\nBrice surprised the College this\nweek with the news that, after six\nyears, he will soon be leaving the\nWest London Chaplaincy.\nPaul, who recently won first\nprize in the 'freestyle' section of\nIBM' s 'Leonardo da Vinci' multi-media competition, is\nmoving to become the Secretary\nfor Higher Education / Chaplaincy for the General Synod of\nthe Church of England. He will\nbe based in Church House,\nWestminster but will spend\nmuch of his time visiting University chaplaincies nationwide.\nMr Brice will be concerned\nwith issues in higher education\nsuch as student finance, the\npastoral side of Chaplaincy care\nand generally being the Synod's 'student expert'. In addition,\nPaul said that \"jacking up the\nInternet side of things\" would be\nhigh on his agenda. \"It's weird,\"\nhe said \"but I don't feel like I'm leaving Imperial. I 'll be cycling\npast it every day and I 'll still be\ninvolved in higher education\".\nPaul is presently trying to\ndevelop his multi-media 'Virgin\nof the Unbelievable' carol service\nfor use in a cathedral setting\nwhilst in June he will be giving a one day workshop on 'Medium\nand Worship' to a conference of\nEuropean Chaplains.\nThere will be a farewell\n'wine and nibbles' evening for\nPaul starting at 5.30pm on\nTuesday 9th May at the 'Solar\nRoom and Gardens', 170 Queens\nGate. Those wishing to attend\nshould notify the Chaplaincy on\nextension 49600.\nNUS Referendum\n(News in Briefcontinues from page 2)\nStudent Television Awards. First\nprize in the 'Best Station Ident'\ncategory went to Robin Riley, a second year physics student. His\nimaginative piece for STOIC is\nbased on frenetic movements\nacross a tube map.\nCarlo Massarella, STOIC's News Editor, narrowly missed\nout on second prize in the 'News\nand Current Affairs' category. His\nentry, 'Election '95' was described\nby the judges as a 'report of high\nquality'. Mr Massarella later said\nhe was glad that: \"the hard work\nthat many people have put into\nthe station over the year has come\nup with good results\".\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY With the Imperial College Union\n(ICU) referendum on affiliation\nto the NUS fast approaching,\nthere is much confusion over the\nsources of funding for the 'pro'\nand 'anti' campaigns. The two\ngroups were formed at the end of\nlast term to present both sides of\nthe argument to the student\nbody. Each campaign is allowed\nto spend up to \u00a3160 promoting\ntheir case.\nThere have been rumours\nthat the National Conservative\nStudents organisation might\nfund the anti-affiliation\ncampaign. Andrew Reid of\nConservative Central Office told\nFELIX:\" I think they're doing a very good job running their\ncampaign at the moment ... I hope they succeed.\"\nHe added that he felt the\nNUS should be a common forum\nfor representation for all\nstudents, irrespective of their\npolitical sympathies. Mr Reid\nsaid that it should also provide\nvalue for money, something he\nwasn't sure \"it had been for the\nlast couple of years.\" However he\ndid not indicate whether\nConservative Central Office has\nbeen financing the anti-campaigners. The head of the\nanti-NUS affiliation campaign,\nSarah Thomas, told FELIX that\nthey were receiving money, but\nfrom a source who wished to\nremain anonymous. \" I'm not\ndirectly involved with the\nfunding\" she said, \"[but] we're\nreasonably well organised.\" She\ndid indicate that their source\nwished to 'keep a low profile'.\nA spokesperson for the NUS told FELIX that whilst they\nsupported the pro-campaigners,\nsaying that it would be \"nice to\nhave everybody in the club\", they\nwould not directly fund the\nproponents. According to Lucy\nChothia, ICU President, the pro-campaign group will not be\nreceiving cash from the NUS as\nthere would appear to be no\ncomparable source for the anti-campaign lobby. However the\npro-campaign may be receiving\npublicity material directly from\nthe NUS, the monetary value of\nwhich would be deducted from\ntheir \u00a3160 allowance.\nOf the referendum itself,\nshe said: \"It's important that\neveryone votes, and finds out as\nmuch as they can to form an\nobjective opinion.\"\nWelcome back to college and to\nthe wonderful world of the\nsummer term. I always used to\nenjoy this term because after the\ncold splash of the exams there was\njust this long float down into the\nlethargic waters of the summer\nholidays. Departments attempt to\nmaintain their inordinate levels\nof fear by setting end-of-year\nprojects but usually in even the\nmost diligent case the post-exam\nstudent calculates how many\nmarks they are worth: whilst\nlying on the Queen's Lawn wondering when to start. With one half of the student populace\nrevising and the other half\nreclining Imperial finally seems a nice place be...\nMy woes (of course)\nUNLESS you are the editor of the\nstudent newspaper. This term\nbecomes a crisis of self-doubt, of\nrealising your insignificance in\nthe face of your writers doing\nexams, no news because nobody is\naround to make any and half\ncollected piles of FELICE S littering the corridors until some\nkind hearted cleaner takes pity\nand kerosene s the lot.\nSo we will be shrinking a little this term: I want to provide\nrelevant(ish) stuff rather than\nrelevant stuff with a few pages of\nsubstandard material to boost the\nsize. ( And with inadequate\nfunding from the Union as paper\nprices rise, it'll provide a useful\nmodel of 'restraint').\nBut all those people out there\nwho either promised me things\nand never wrote them, or\npromised themselves that they\nwould contribute something but\nnever promised me (this is\nstarting to sound incestuous) -there is still time! And you will\nget an even more joyous reception\nin the office than you would have\nin the crowded months before,\nalthough my lone cries of thanks\nmay sound a little spooky in the\nsilence that echoes in FELIX TOWERS. Where does all the money go?\nIn the light of recent cuts in Union funding (because, we are\nassured, the whole college is\nbeing affected by HE FCE cuts)\nwe may require new fund-raising\nefforts lest FELIX becomes a stunted kitten forever. With the\neconomy picking up, I shall soon\nbe popping down to ' Our Computers R Yours' warehouse\non Queensgate where I hear credit\nfacilities are good and top-range\nequipment is available to all. Everyone seems to be moving\ninto the computer market these\ndays and if you can't beat them...\nCredits\nEditor Owain Bennallack\nPrinter Andy Thompson\nAssistant Printer Jeremy Thomson\nBusiness Manager Tim Bavister\nAdvertising Manager Wei Lee\nEditorial Team\nArt & Literature Jon Jordan\nCinema Wei Lee\nClubs, Societies & Union Piers Daniell\nColumns Marcus Alexander\nFeatures Kate Cox\nLayout and Design Jon Jordan\nMusic Vik Bansal\nNews The News Team\nPhotography Ivan Chan & Diana Harrison\nPuzzles Tim St Clair\nS Flles Rebecca Mileham\nEight Day Guide Jeremy Thomson\nSport Juliette Decock and Mark Baker\nStandby Jon Jordan\nEditorial Assistance\nCollating Last Week\nJon Jordan, Paul Dias,\nMark Baker, Jeremy T Typing Jon Jordan\n2\n8\nH PR95 FELIX MM\n\n"

He sought to know\nthe world. The ending of this quest\nwas not due to his achieving his\naim, his attainment of fulfillment.\nHe was arrested by the lure of his\nprison cell.\nUntil the present time, his\nexistence had been one of doubt;\na state of seeking for the certainty\nthat he considered could be\nprovided by answers. He sought\nthe understanding, the meanings\nwith which life could hold to some\nkind of sense. Some might say that\nLuckily she walked past the\ncommunal bit in the changing\nroom and snuck in a cubicle to try\non her kinky leather trousers.

It as\nbecome a modern 'lifestyle' classic\nGeneration Y: This is primarily an invention by the\nIndependent newspaper which\ndescribes the behaviour of a generation which it called 'Y'( hence the title). Determined\nattempts to find an example of this\ngeneration have met with failure\nhowever, which suggests that like\nthe 'typical Independent reader',\nthey are merely a figment of the\neditor's imagination.\nIsabel\nsuch a quest would be futile from\nthe outset; they might be correct,\nbut the Frater considered futility to\nbe an useful utility, a tool which\ncould bring him closer to his goal.\nSuch was the nature of his\nfoolishness. He explored the\nabbe rations of human normality,\nand each expedition led him\ndeeper into the confusion that he\nfound. The soul of society is indeed\nwounded and unsound, and thus\nhis seeking could only bring him\nfurther from his goals. There could\nbe no end to such a task.\nThe end came not from his\nquest, but from his eventual\nabandonment of it. This was not\nthrough failure, but was an act of\nsuccess. He discovered answers\nwhich questioned his method of\nfulfillment, and realised its flaws.\nAnd thus he, your humble Frater,\nchose to become imprisoned in a chamber of constancy, with only\nthe inscriptions on the walls to\nprovide him with respite. And thus,\nharnessed and with peace, shall\nhe remain.\n\"Put all the images in\nlanguage in a place of safety and\nmake use of them, for they are in\nthe desert, and it's in the desert\nthat we must go and look for\nthem.\"\n\u2014Jean Genet\n\n"
