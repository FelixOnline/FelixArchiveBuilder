    "content": "ICLUBS & SOCIETIESI\nICCAG\nChristmas is coming up folks, which might\nhave cheerful prospects for some but for the\nhomeless it can be quite a dismal time. Crisis at\nChristmas is an organisation which tries to\nhelp these people in London. This year they\nneed volunteers to go on a sponsored pilgrimage from Canterbury to London on\nDecember 4 and 5. Also needed are people to\nstand at checkpoints. Over the Christmas\nperiod there is a crisis centre which provides\nshelter and food for homeless people. Volunteers are needed for eight hour periods\nof helping at the centre, help to set it up and\nclear up and also drivers over the age of\ntwenty-five with or without a car. If you could\npossibly help with any of the above please\ncome to the Community Action Group meeting every Monday, 12:30 in the Rag Office\n(next to Snooker) or contact Rebecca May,\nPhysics 3.\nFilmsoc\nApologies to the masses who thronged Beit\nQuad last Friday, desperately looking for the\nFlicker but my excuse, though hard to\nstomach, was accurate\u2014London Co-op had\nindeed provided us with two soundtracks and\nno film.\nThis week it will be different! For one thing\nwe will be in ME220 again and for another we\nare getting the film from a somewhat more\nreliable if mundane source: Rank Film Hire.\nThe film is Network-a superb satire on the\nAmerican media. Peter Finch plays aTV anchorman who on learning he is to be sacked\ndue to falling ratings has a breakdown. The TV company still allow him to make one last show\nand then the film starts.\nSo tonight at 8:30 in ME220 is where everyone's gonna be (I hope). It's free to\nmembers and an incredibly cheap 50p to non-members.\nAll that guff about people wanting to help\nor form a film-making branch still applies so\nplease come along.\nIn case you think you've been robbed at 30p, dear members, we have been given a credit by\nLondon Film Co-op and hence will screen\nFlicker at a later date.\nJewish Soc\nFollowing the success of our first Friday night\nmeal, several more will be added to this term's Bookshop News\nObviously the serious part is now over, we are\nhaving to reorder our Asterix titles!\nNo gripes this week, like me you are\naccepting cranky turnstiles, paper bags, receipts, etc.\nOnly nine weeks to Christmas. Keep your\neyes on the window. We are ordering some\ngood titles that will make ideal presents.\nFor those interested, we have a good selection of slide rules, all at a very reasonable\nprice.\nNew Titles\nBritish Museum Natural History - Whitehead\n& Keates, Philip Wilson Publ \u00a37.95\nWe Learned to Ski-Sunday Times, Collins,\n\u00a38.95\nComplete Handbook of Video - Owen& Dunton, Allen Lane \u00a38.95\nWithin Whicker World - Alan Whicker, Elm\nTree Books \u00a38.95\nMaster Chefs of France Recipe Book - Courtine, David & Charles \u00a39.50\nFlight of the Condor - Andrews, Collins/ BBC \u00a312.95\nBirdwatch round Britain \u2014 Dougall & Axell,\nCollins \u00a38.95\nAmerican London - Newson, Q Books \u00a34.50*\nAlternative London - Otherwise Press \u00a33.50\nQuiz Yourself - David Self, Ward Lock \u00a31.25\nThe Silent Intruder - Panati & Hudson, Pan\n\u00a31.75\nHardacre - Wingate, Pan \u00a31.50\nGhosf Story - Straub, Futura \u00a31.95\nShuttlecock - Swift, Penguin, \u00a32.25\nHobgoblin - Coyne, Fontana, \u00a31.75\nQuest for the well of souls - Chalker, Penguin\n\u00a31.75\nprogramme of events.

    "content": "IC Council\nSir\nI would like to correct the\ninaccurate description of the\nHouse Committee given by Nick\nPyne in last week's FELIX. The\npartition that used to be in the\nLower Lounge was ordered by\nBarney McCabe without any\napproval by House Committee.\nI would also disagree with\nNick's comment that House\nCommittee spend a lot of\nmoney. This year it has been\nallot ed only \u00a315,000 to cover all\nthe maintenance of the Union\nBuilding and the replacement of\nits equipment. The grant is\n\u00a35,000 bigger than it was to have\nbeen to cover the costs involved\nin the move of the refectory.\nMost of the money goes to\nrepair the damage done by\nvandalism and over excited\nparties. Considering that it costs\n\u00a32,000 just to paint one room it\nis amazing that the building is\nnot in a worse state than it is. I do agree with Nick though that\nit ought to look better. Perhaps\nsince he is on the PWP he should\nsuggest that that group reconsider the money House Committee get, after they have discovered the true facts.\nColin Cooper\nHouse Committee member\nDear Sir\nThanks for the explanation\nabout IC Council last week\u2014I had forgotten about it, even\nthough I am an ex (Dep Rep)\nmember.\nThe trouble with Council is\nnot that it has too many mem-be rs, nor that it drags on for too\nlong, neither is it boring.( Though it has, it does and it is!)\nThe main probe ms are (really):\n1. It forgets what it is about\n(ie managing the Union).\n2. It is (often) weakly chaired.\n3. It does not work to a timetable.\n4. It is (always) full of prat s more interested in politics than\nin doj ng the jobs for which they\n..were elected, who use their ex\nPog e2 officio positions on Council to\nexpose their narrow mindedness.\nMuch of the problem lies in\nthe duplication of effort between\nCC Us and ICU( look at the\nworld of academic affairs). That\nis another topic.\nYours, believing that nothing ever\nchanges\nDavid Kelsall\nChem Eng PG Lust and\nPornography\nDear FELIX\nAfter my first day at Imperial\nI was not impressed (nearer\nviolently sick) perhaps it was the\nsilly jokes of the Union officials\nor perhaps it was a little white\nbooklet called ...but afraid to\nask. Opening this book, I expected a student's eye view of\nIC before my eyes, but found a student's eye view of sex. While I am not naive enough to think\nby pretending it does not happen\nit will not happen, and I do not\nask that all IC should observe\nmy moral code, all I ask that all\nIC should not impose its moral\ncode onto me! (Note the first\npage of the pamphlet which\nimplied that it was essential\nreading for fresher s). This pamphlet all but ignored the\nalternative philosophy to sex put\nforward by a number of religious\nand non-religious ph y colo gist s. What treatment that was given\nof this alternative was the\nimplication that no real people\nbelieve this, I assure you there\nare.\nI would like to comment on\nthe implication that the safe\nperiod was the method of contraception for Catholics. I do\nnot intend to put forward arguments for or against contraception but only to say that the\nchurch has told us that it's use is\nextremely damaging to one's spiritual life and so are not to be\nused. The use of contraceptives\nas with murder is a matter of\nconscience but is damaging to\nthe user and therefore a wrong.\nMy third point concerns the first\nGuildsheet cover and the HG Wells Society poster. I agreed\nthe lusting for the body in it's own right is de human ising. If\nwomen are treated inhumanely\nnot just in this way but in\nexplicit pornography also (the\nprinciple's the same) then is it\nnot s uprising( and I put this as a question) that in some cases\nwhere women are held in very\nlow regard by men, rape and\nsexual assault.\nMark Alderton\nEE Dear Martin,\nWell, I seem to have come in for\nquite a lot of stick in this week's FELIX. Whilst I don't give a damn about most of it, I feel that\nI must reply to the letter from\nour dear friend Mark Alderton.\nI'm sorry, but I just don't accept\nthat in \"...but were afraid to\nask\" we were trying to impose\nany moral code on anyone. I can\naccept that anyone with such a sheltered upbringing as Mark\nhas obviously had might find\nsome of the material shocking,\nbut if he could only overcome\nhis inhibitions and actually read\nthe material, he might find that\nfar from taking any moral\nstandpoint, that the publication\naims to give factual information.\nWhilst Mark may feel that, when\nthe time comes (doubtless after\nHoly wedlock), that all will\ncome naturally. Well, I am\nafraid to say that it doesn't, and\nneglect of such information can\nlead to a lot of hardship for all\ninvolved.\nReally Mark, isn't it time that\nyou grew up and faced the world\nas it is? You can't bury your\nhead and pretend that it doesn't happen for the rest of your life!\nYours etc.\nNick Pyne\nEditor \"...but were\nafraid to ask\"\nSouthside Cafe\nSir\nI wish to complain, not about\nthe food in the Southside Refectory (not yet) but of some\nof the people who use it.\nIt would appear to be an open\nhouse for every builders labourer in the area. Not only do they\ncome into the refectory in dirty\noveralls, but more often smothered in cement etc; but it would\nappear that you are open to\nabuse if you ask them not to rub\nagainst your clothes, and like\nmost people, I like a bit of\nbuilders dust on my food, it's an\naid to digestion.\nIf the powers that be want a workman's cafe to operate in\nSouthside, then I would suggest\nthat they open a refectory\nsomewhere for students.\nYours sincerely\n3 1st Year Chemists\nNews Reporting\nDear Sir\nA news item appeared in\nFELIX last week, on the back\npage, entitled \"Debsoc Comes\nOut\". This item did not appear\non the letters page or the\neditorial or reviews, it was\nplainly news. Yet on reading the\n[October 29,19821\nstory one not only finds several\nminor and excusable mistakes\nbut one discovers the opinion of\nthe writer.\nThe anonymous contributor\nuses rhetorical language to\nsupport the opposers of the\nmotion \"This House believes\nMultilateralists live in a Dream\nWorld\".\nMr Curry was the best speaker,\nbut to go so far as to say his\nmetaphors were charming and\nthat they complemented solid\narguments by Mr Sketch exceeds\nthe boundaries of news reporting.\nYou may argue that the boundaries are very hazy and I will\nagree. Even so, here they were\ndefinitely over-reached. You may argue that news is bound to\ninclude opinions of the reporters,\nif it is to such an extent as to\ndistort the event being described\nI believe the reporter has failed\nin his/her task. In this particular\ncase no mention whatsoever was\ngiven of the argument of the\nproposer, the reader is not even\ntold if indeed they had one.\nIf the FELIX staff recognises\nwhat it prints as opinionated it\nshould either give alternative\nviews of the same event or state\nin each issue that the news is not\nnews but the opinions of its\nwriters.\nMichael Newman\nLife Sci 1\n(Proposer of the motion)\nMiscellany at Large\nDear Editor\nBravo! A rare triumph of art\nover the harsh utilitarianism of\nImperial. Scorning the over-worn clich es of white squares to\nwrite in, the FELIX calendar\nexplores exciting new reaches of\nillegibility as the proud owner\ntries to compress more and more\ninformation into a smaller and\nsmaller white triangle as term\nprogresses. Surely a poignant\nmetaphor of student life.\nRobert Macrae\nDear Mr Taylor\nYour readers may be interested\nto learn that we sold an extremely\nencouraging number of Life Sci\nsweatshirts after the now infant\no us modelling session.\nYours sincerely\nPeter Burt\nDear Martin S Taylor,\nWhy is it that the Letters to the\nEditor always take up exactly\none page, and there is never a small gap left at the foot of the\nlast column?\nYours sincerely\nJ Martin Taylor\nHH HM HH HM HH H FELIX\n\n"

Well, here she is,\nappearing in Mata Han (a musical in which she\nhas the leading role) in the studio theatre of a shredded wheat box known as the Lyric,\nHammersmith.\nSuch a venture for a pop music performer\none would expect to be a mere ego trip.

There's the formal\nGraduate Recruitment Programme, when 250\nfirms hold 'Milkround' interviews. Then there\nare presentations by firms, and old student\nassociations careers evenings. Less formally,\nthe Industrial Society has arranged eight visits\nto companies this term.\nThe Need for a Careers Fair\nHowever, none of these enables you to make\ndirect comparisons between firms in one day.\nSo, the Industrial Society and the Careers\nAdvisory Service have organised the first IC\nCareers Fair.\nThe Fair\nThe Careers Fair isn't part of a selection\nprocess by the sixty firms attending. The sole\npurpose is to help final year students find out\nabout job vacancies in 1983. You should also\nbe able to penetrate the 'public relations' gloss\nwhich covers some recruitment brochures.\nEach firm is attending only one session.\nEither morning (9:30am to 1:00pm) or\nafternoon (2:00 to 5:30pm).

    "content": "mt KAB OVT to oH see by Mobile Optics Inc.\nWhat, no photos?\nThis Walkabout-Looksee is right on our\ndoorstep: an exhibition of handcrafted Indian\ntextiles at the Royal College of Art. On the day\nthe exhibition opened, the catalogue had been\nheld up in Bombay and no press photos were\navailable! I shall chat descriptively instead!\nThe four goals of life\nIn the Indian concept of life, the universe and\neverything (sic), man is made up of the\nphysical, the emotional, the mental, and the\nspiritual. The body is conceived of as a chariot;\nthe self rides the chariot with the intellect as\nthe chariot driver; the mind is the reins and the\nsenses are the horses. If man achieves a bala nee between Self, senses and mind, he will\nattain a state of detachment and release. Such\nbalance can be reached by following the four\ngoals of life: first 'dharma'\u2014duty; then\n'artha'\u2014wealth-winning; thirdly 'kama'\u2014\n\u2014desire; which includes the pleasure of\nfestivals, music and sport, as well as sexual\nenjoyment; and finally 'mosh ka '\u2014release from\nthe cycle of birth and death.\nThe period of 'artha' is expressly practical,\ntemporal things like gaining power and piling\nup worldly goods. And art itself belongs to the\nworld of sense perceptions, the pursuit of\nduty, power and pleasure. So India early\nevolved the many professional trades\nresponsible for producing the necessities of\nlife. Weavers wove intricate patterns of cloth,\ncoloured with vegetable dyes; silver-, copper-,\nbronze- and iron-smiths embellished the\nhouseholder's life with decorations on all sorts\nof useful objects.\nThe Master Weavers' Exhibition\nThe exhibition shows the great range of skills\nwithin the tradition of handcrafted textiles.\nHuge, brass and copper vessels, the sort that\nAli Baba and the forty thieves would fit into,\nserve as accessories to the textiles. They are\nrather effective, in a slightly self-conscious\ninterior-design way \u2014 I liked the contrast\nbetween the rounded volume of unpolished,\nheavy metal and the glowing colours and\nintricate designs of the silks and cottons, hung\nflat, like pictures.\nAll sorts of different techniques have been\nused to decorate the spreads and hangings:\nblock printing, dye painting, tie-dying, quilting\nand appliqu e. The patterns may be geometrical\nin rich earthy colours, or made up of stylised\nflowers. This is where the classic 'Liberty'\npatterns drew their inspiration! You'll also\nrecognise the Kashmiri 'bot eh' or cone motif,\nwhich has come to be known as the 'Paisley\npattern'. Other hangings are pictorial: there\nare four versions of the Tree of Life design,\neach more exuberant than the last. The\nbranches of the tree twist and loop, bearing\nfairy-tale flowers and birds of paradise. The\npinks and blue-greens glow, the gold glitters,\nand the parrots are on their way to an English\nchintz.\nBut, the fabulously rich brocades have to be\nseen to be believed. One complete gallery is\ndevoted to a display of brocade silk yardages\nfrom Varanasi (Benares), and golden cloth\nsaris, also of Varanasi brocade. The walls\nshimmer, from red-gold through a metallic\nspectrum of cool pistachio-silver. How\nfortunate that s aries do not date! Some of-these are likely to become heirlooms, in the\nsame way as an English silver teapot.\nPage6 BBB HH HB HH REVIEWS!\nDownstairs, bamboo poles are arranged like\nopen-ended wigwams, tented with saris; silks\nin the courtly colours of the peacock, cottons\nin blazing reds and ochre browns. Some are so\nfine as to be almost transparent. They conjure\nup the brightness of a tropical sun: imagine the\npavements round the dyers shops running\nwith lemon and vermilion, as the dyers walk\nback and forth with wet cloth billowing in the\nbreeze while it dries...or, better still, pop\naround to the RCA and see the end product!\nWhere, when \u00a3?\nThe Handcrafted Textiles of India is at the\nRoyal College of Art, Kensington.Gore, SW7,\nuntil November 17. Open Mon-Sat, 10:00-6:00pm, Wed 10:00-8:00pm, Sun 2:00-6:00pm. Admission is free.\nThe Awakening Earth: Our Evolutionary\nLeap, by Peter Russell, Routledge &\nKegan, Paul \u00a34.95\nMaybe in these times it's reasonable that\nthere should be a market for blatant cheer-up\nbooks but even so it's hard to imagine anyone\ntaking this book seriously. Peter Russell seems\nto have moved into a field already exploited by\ncranks like Von Daniken and Lyall Watson.\nThe latter has written several books in a 'gee\nit's won oe rful' tone of voice, and may well have\ninspired Russell to write the way he does; one\nof Dr Watson's books (Lifetide) is included in\nthe Further Reading section. The publishers\nhave decided to sell this one by abandoning\nany appearance of restraint and making pretty\nludicrous claims on behalf of the book, for\nexample: \"...We now hold the evolutionary\nfuture of humanity in our own hands\u2014or\nrather in our own heads. The next major\ndevelopment would be the linking of individual\nminds into a planetary consciousness: the\nEarth would become a single sentient being.\"\nOf course anyone who's inclined to believe this\nshould seek medical advice as soon as\npossible, but the publishers clearly reckon that\nthis is the way to sell their book\u2014ie go for the\ncredulous loonies for all you're worth. Peter\nRussell himself is more restrained but has been\ntaken in by Eastern mysticism among other\nthings, having previously written The TM\nTechnique, and Meditation, and he also gives\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi the top of the billing in\nthe acknowledgements. The book itself follows\nthe sort of format that would appeal to people\nwho want to read something tremendously\nprofound and significant (Prologue, Part One,\nPart Two, Epilogue, and so on), with snatches\nfrom physics, chemistry, psychology,\nmysticism, levitation, etc, etc. It has numerous\ntables and diagrams, quotes from the Tao Te\nChing, and chapter after chapter reading like\nthis: \"In addition to learning a dualistic\nlanguage, the growing child learns from his\nparents how to h ink and behave. If the parents\nare seen to be working on the assumption that\nT am 'in here', completely seperate from the\nenvironment 'out there', then the child learns\nto adopt the same model and begins to\ndevelop his own thinking along the same lines.\nSo the skin-encapsulated ego develope s.\" All\nin all it's largely bogus rubbish, although well\nwritten and very learned.\nNick Willson\nI October 29,19821 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Mary Freeman\nIt is probably a good thing that\nMary Freeman has resigned as\nHonorary Secretary; her un popularity in the Union Office\nwas making it impossible for the\nUnion to run smoothly and there\nwere several important deadlines\nshe failed to meet.\nBut the circumstances which\nled to her resignation, and particularly the nature and source of much of the criticism\nlevelled at her give some cause\nfor concern. Mary was attacked\nas lazy, ineffectual and having\nno real concept of the Hon See's job. None of these criticisms is\ndirectly valid. Her main fault\n(albeit a serious one, and one\nwhich cannot be condoned) is\nthat she had no sense of priority\nin her work; little jobs which\nshould have been brushed aside\nwere dealt with in such pernick e ty detail that larger, more important\nissues were left untouched, and\nwork which kept her in the office\nlate into the evening prevented\nher from dealing with urgent\nenquiries at 9:30 in the morning.\nYet how were these faults\ndealt with? Surely the correct\nprocedure would be for the\nPresident to ask Mary into his\noffice for what is known euphemistically as 'a quiet word' or,\nmore seriously, a 'formal reprimand'. This was not done. Instead, the only criticism Mary received was in the form of snide\ncomments from the Acting Deputy President Christine Teller and pompous noises from\nStephen. Such attacks are rarely\nmade directly to the person concerned, and so Mary was left\nto pick up purely negative, non-constructive criticism from the\ngrapevine of Union hacks who\nhang around the Union Office\u2014\nincluding, astonishingly, the\nEDITORIAL\nUnion permanent staff, who are\nsupposed to be below the\nHonorary Secretary and should\ncertainly know their position\nbetter than this. Neither was the\ncriticism restrained to factual\nfailings, and people who ought\nto be more responsible were\nhappy to mingle cruel jokes about Mary's private life with\nserious criticism, and, moreover,\nwithout restricting the gossip to\nother Union hacks alone.\nWhy have the Union been so\nunhelpful? The reason is found\nin the first words of Christine\nTeller's speech at Tuesday's UG M:\"I never liked Mary from\nthe start.\" It is because the\nUnion have allowed their personal feelings against Mary to\ninfluence the way they treated\nher in her job that undoubted\nfailings were exacerbated.\nOne final example of Stephen\nGoulder's unkindness: On the\nFriday afternoon after her resignation Mary was relaxing\nwith some friends in the Dramsoc\nstore. She had kept the keys to\nher office to enable her to tidy\nup over the weekend, and leave a note for the new Hon Sec describing the jobs which were\nor weren't finished, the contents\nof the files, and so on and so\nforth. Stephen then arrived at\nthe door and sent in John McCallion( who had at that\nstage been DP for just ten\nminutes) as a kind of bali ff, to\ndemand the return of the keys.\nWhen Mary refused, Stephen\nhimself entered, took the keys,\nand with a whirl of pompous\ninsults and snide comments about Mary's incompetence, stormed off.\nNo, Mary was not a good\nHonorary Secretary, but did she\nhave to be forced out so unpleasantly? In her letter of resignation she complained about a lack of compassion in\nthe Union; judging from the\nreaction since she left, she seems\nto have been right.\nMascotry\nMascotry is one of the great\ntraditions of London University,\nand of Imperial College with its\nthree CC Us in particular. It provides a lot of fun, excitement\nand a challenge to the skills of\nthe various Union personnel and\nraises a large amount of money\nfor charity at the same time.\nTwo weeks ago, R CSU made\nan attempt to steal Spanner and\nBolt from the Elec Eng Freshers'\ndinner. The attempt was beaten\noff( by Professor Anderson, amongst others, as reported last\nweek) but apart from getting a little too violent it was a reasonable attempt at a mascot\nraid, and well within the spirit\nand rules of r rias co try. But since then, R CSU have\nbeen turning up in small numbers\nto act as a 'worrying party' at\nsubsequent fresher s' dinners. The numbers involved are so\nsmall that no serious attempt at\ntheft is intended; the intruders\nare merely there to 'worry' the\nGuilds men organising the dinner. Is there any purpose to\nthis? It seems that the only thing\nit achieves is to prevent Guilds men from attending to the\nbusiness in hand (ie welcoming\nfresher s and enjoying a relaxed\nmeal in a social atmosphere) and\nannoying the visiting staff members. In fact, several complaints have been made by engineering lecturers about the\nworrying parties.\nIf a serious raid is intended,\nthen well and good, but Jo provide small groups of pickets\nto hang around the door of the\nrefectory is just what it is intended to be\u2014a pain in the\nneck.\nFELIX Staff\nThanks to everyone who turned\nup after my appeal last week,\nand thanks to all those who were\nso patient with the folding machine on Thursday.\nHowever, we still need news\nreporters and photographers, particularly any who can spare\ntime on Thursday afternoons. It\ndoesn't have to be a regular\ncommitment, just as long as we\nknow you're there if we need\nyou.

    "content": "Volleyball\nThe Volleyball Club has begun\nthe year on the right foot, with a fair number of interested (and\ninteresting!) people turning up\nto our practise sessions. Our aim this year is to put up two men's teams and a ladies' team, and we\nneed a few more people to achieve that\u2014so if you're at all\nhandy at jumping and hitting\n( ah, so you had a younger brother, too!), or if you're just\ncurious, come along to a session\non Wednesday or Saturday afternoons (both beginning at\n1330h). We also have a special ladies-only session on Tuesday evenings,\nfrom 1730 to 1900 or so, when\nthe net is at the correct height for\nwomen (ie eight inches lower\nthan for men!), which makes\nthings a lot easier.\nAll sessions are in the Volleyball Court on the second floor of\nthe old Chemistry Building behind Biochemistry (follow the\nsigns up the iron staircase).\nAny queries, then contact me,\nPeter Dias Lal caca, viaE lec En gPG letter-racks or Nada El Yassir, the ladies captain, via\nLife Sci 2 letter-racks.\nQ Sailing\nThe Imperial team began the\nseason un auspiciously at the\nCastaway's' Foot' Trophy. Twenty teams from around\nthe country assembled in a foggy\nforce zero at the weekend to sail\nfor the trophy. IC made a hopeful start beating Castaways\nsecond team (just) arriving at the\nfinish line ahead of some people\nwho, in previous years, have\nsailed not only in the University\nFirst team but also the British\nUniversities team. However, not\nsurprisingly, considering the\ngreater experience and speed of\nmany of the teams, IC did not\ncontinue to win but were often\nfound team r aching each other\nwith the opposition some (con-side r able) distance in front in an\nunassailable position.\nIt's an old, old story of 'The\nFoot'. All the other club teams\nhave been sailing all summer and\nare well in practice, whereas the\nImperial team had been formed\non the previous Wednesday and\nnever sailed together before\nSaturday. All we could hope to\ndo was beat the other university\nteams present\u2014this we (almost)\ndid beating Cambridge and UL FELIX \u2022 \u2022 BS MM HH9 H HI Ladies, but loosing to UL1. No panic and hope for the future.\nIncidentally, UL1 were losing semi-finalists. UL2 would\nhave lost to IC had the two met.\nBoth UL teams consisted mainly\nof IC people \u2014 which seems crazy but there it is. The trophy\nwas won by Castaways first\nteam.\nTeam: Graham, Graham, Pete,\nDave, Julian, Jim, Richard, Mike.\nSnooker\nThe A team has made a slow\nstart in their first season in the\nLondon Shipping Companies league. They were narrowly defeated7;5 by the league champions from Silvertown last\nweek although with slightly more luck and slightly less\nalcohol consumption it could\nhave been a different story. Thomas on was particularly unlucky when he accidentally\nconceded his frame. The standard of play in this league is\nclearly much higher than the\nUL U league which was dominated by IC last year, but the\nteam is confident that they will\nwin the title.\nThere will be a potluck doubles tournament in the coming weeks which is open to\nall club members (if you are not\na member yet, bring \u00a31 to the\nSnooker Room any lunchtime).\nDetails of all tournament, and\nmatches, will be on the Snooker\nClub noticeboard.\nCross Country\nRichmond Park\nThe third race of the season was\nour own IC friendly at Richmond Park and after last year's disaster (when only one person\nwent the right way due to a lack\nof markers) it was hoped that\nthis year would be more success-ful. The race was due off at\n3 : 0 0 pm but by ten past the\ncaptain (who was the only one\nwho knew the course) had still\nnot turned up. There were visions of last year repeating\nitself until the captain, attired in\na rather gro tty track suit and\nriding what looked to be his\ngranny's bone-shaker appeared\nover the hill. Eventually the race\ngot underway (in the traditional\nrain shower) with Hugh Dixon finishing fourth and newcomer\nTim Scott doing well in seventh\nplace. A large IC contingent\nensured our first team of second\nplace and a good time was had\nby all (except the captain who\nalmost has his beard shaved).\nA training schedule has been\nput up on the cross country\nnoticeboard so if you want to get\nfit to race, or even for fun, why\nnot turn up and train with other\npeople\u2014it's much more enjoyable than on your own.\nSouthampton\nClub members gained their first\nmedal success of the season\ncompeting for London University at Southampton on Oct 23.\nOver the five miles course of\nquite muddy woodland tracks\nwe finished third team out of\nseventeen (IC had three members\nof the five man team). Hugh Dixon ran well to finish sixteenth\nwith Graham Harker finishing\nthirty fourth. The team was\ncompleted by Jeff Hudson finishing thirteenth in his first\nrun for IC. Squash\nFirst the bad news. The first and\nthird teams both lost whilst the\nfourth team only won by a walkover.\nThe good is that Howard Bills\nand Laaeque Daneshmend have\nrecently been selected for the\nUL U first team.\nMembership has soared to\napproximately 140, and better\nstill is that temporary ladders\nhave been put up at last which\nshould open up lines of com mun should open lines of communication between previously unacquainted players of similar\nstanding. It is hoped to replace\nthem in the next three weeks or\nso by some of rather more robust construction, ACC funds\nwilling.\nBadminton\nFirsts\nIC vs QM C81Our1s t pair (Steve and Lee)\nstarted the season well playing\nagainst a QM C1st pair which\nshowed a lot of ability and enthusiasm but not the expedience to overcame the skill and\ntactical ability of our players.\nHowever, our 2nd pair, a new\npairing who have not had any\nmatch experience together, were\nnot so fortunate in that they met\na QM C2 nd pair which combined well in co-ordination and\ntactics and who defeated our\npair in two straight sets. After\nthis initial setback, the team settled down to playing to the\nstandard expected of the 1st Division trophy holders and the\ngame was won quite comfortably\n8-1, with the help of a relatively\nlarge group of IC supporters\nwho watched avidly till the end.\nThanks to all the team who\nplayed.\nTeam practice nights on Tuesdays\u2014team selection based\non these nights. Be there.\nTeam: S Willis, L Yap, I Bull,\nD Demico, I Othman, T Lai.\nLadies\nIC vs QM C81 After forfeiting one game due to\nthe non appearance of their captain and a second pair player\nin the first half-hour of play,\nQM C pro ceded to lose game\nafter game. IC's first pair, Andre and Sue, played with com manding authority conceding a total of only nineteen points in\nsix games. Jane and Dot followed their team-mate's initiative and won both their matches\nconvincingly. Miranda and Ann after defeating Q MC's first and\nthird pair were perhaps unfortunate in losing to Q MC's second pair \u2014 but all in all a thoroughly satisfying morning's play by IC. Team: A Rickard, S Newton\n(first pair), J Radford, D Payne\n(second pair), M Bellchambers, A Lister (3rd pair).\nLacrosse\nLadies lacrosse is a sport conspicuous by its absence at IC. However by looking a little\nfurther afield it is possible to\nplay for a team or alternatively\njust for fun. This can be accomplished by turning up at the\nUL U Gym in Malet Street at\n2 : 0 0 pm on Wednesday afternoons. Here you will find( hopefully) the UL U ladies lacrosse club training hard (?).\nThe club m edt every Wednesd ay and play matches most Saturdays. In past seasons the\nteams have done very well and\nseasons have included tours to\nsuch places as the USA.

    "content": "Mary: Who's to Blame?\nLast Friday Union Honorary Secretary Mary Freeman resigned\nafter receiving an 'insulting' memo from President Stephen\nGoulder. Mr Goulder has subsequently published the memo\nwhich is reproduced below together with his report which was\nreferred back at Tuesday's UGM, and Mary Freeman's reaction\nto the whole affair.\n6It is with great regret that\nI have to in form this\nmeeting that Mary Freeman resigned on Friday\nas from 12:45 that day.\nThe circumstances behind\n.her resignation stretch back\ninto the beginning of the\nsummer vacation when our\nsabbaticals started. By the\nstart of this week the problem\nwas such that in my view she\nf nm. STEPHEN GOULDER.\nr \u201e MARY FREEMAN.\nHon Sec. A Union sabbatical\nis not easy.\nI therefore sent Mary a confidential memorandum. Since I had to leave for the\nUniversity of London Union\nat 11:45 and Mary had not\ncome in until 11:15 I judged\nthat it would be better to\ndiscuss the memo after I returned.\nWhen I returned at 2:30\n22nd October,1982. While Duty Officer at the Guilds gig yesterday evening I collated some of todays issues of FELIX. They did not\ncontain an EXEC NEWS in fact the only notification of the UGM of the26 th October had been given by Martin in his Editorial this I believe was unsolicited by you. On enquiring I discovered that EXEC NEWS had yet to be\npasted up. There was also no sign of any camera ready artwork for the UGM poster. This is almost certainly likely to lead to in quo racy at Tuesday's UGM, if this does occur I think you must consider your position very carefully. I am well aware of the workload given by the Constitution to the Hon. Sec. but I have seen both Liz Lindsay and\nMarco Led wold cope quite well. They both had, on numerous\noccasions, to work late into the evening. This was\nespecially true of Liz who had to geste t ner EXEC NEWS.\nYou do not endear yourself to Council by complaining about your work load. When you stood for election you should have been well aware of the commit tm ents of the job, you\nasked the hustings UGM to trust you - it did, you must\nfulfil your commit t ment to the m.I would also hope that you could be in the office before10.00 amin the mornings, I feel sure that if you did this you would not need to stay in the office quite so late as you do. had lost the confidence of\nCouncil and of the permanent\nstaff. She had failed to\nproduce an Exec News or' any\nU GM posters, the Union Directory was late, she failed\nto come into the office before\n1 0 : 3 0 - 1 1 : 0 0 , despite the\nimportance of allocating parking permits. This late start\nmeant that she had to work\ninto the evening but this is\npar for the course for any\nMary had resigned and left\nthe office; I attempted to\ncontact her but could not. She\nhad already informed the\nUnion and media. I held a news conference at 3:30 and\ncirculated my memo. At 5:30\nthe Exec met and noted her\nresignation and appointed me\nreturning officer in order\nto deal with the Deputy\nPresident's election.\nu me\n9\nReasons for my\nResignation\nDear Martin\nI am writing this letter in\norder to clear up any mistaken\nimpressions that might surround\nmy resignation.\nThe main reason for my\nresignation was the letter that\nSteve sent me regarding the non-appearance of Exec News in last\nweek's FELIX and instructing\nme to be in the office by 10:00am in future. The latter request\nmight seem reasonable, if you do\nnot take into account the reason\nfor my arrival at times after this\nwas due to the fact that the\nprevious night I would have\nbeen working in the office until\ngone 11:00pm OK, so Marco\nand Liz may have managed this,\nbut was it for every single night\n(bar two: Friday 15 when I went\nto the Life Sci dinner and last\nThursday) for two and a half\nweeks?\nIt was obvious from the start\nof my sabbatical post that 1 was\nnot well liked by Steve and\nChristine amongst others, but I had hoped that this would not\ninterfere with my capability of\ndoing my job.\nAs regards my job. 1 felt that I and previous Hon Sees alone\nwere qualified to know what the\njob entailed (yes my habit of\nreading sections of the Blue\nBook did include my job des-cri pti on). Is it surprising then\nthat I felt insulted when Steve\nsaid that I was not doing my job?\n\"Surely,\" you ask, \"he must\nhave had reasons for thinking\nthat you were not?\" \"Yes,\" I answer, \"but that does not mean\nhe can reason correctly.\"\nThere are three 'reasons' that I can come up with.\nThe non-appearance of Exec\nNews\nSteve handed me his article for\nthis Monday( after Pat, the\ntypist, had gone home). That\nevening and the following morning I was preparing papers\nfor Council on the Tuesday\nevening writing up and producing UFC minutes. On Tuesday evening I had Council( which finished at 8:30) and I then wrote and typed up the\nHonorary Secretary' s and Returning Officers's reports for\nExec News and pasted up the\nminutes and papers of the\nprevious Council into the\nMinute Book. I finished this\nsomewhere between 1:00 and\n2:00am and by this time the\nFELIX Office was empty. I thus\ngave the papers to you on the\nWednesday morning as soon as I came in. You complained at the\ntime that the deadline was\n5:30pm Monday, and I gave you\nthe reasons why it could not\nhave been in by then. I also\nreminded you that it is part of\nthe FELIX Editor's job description to \"produce a supplement\nto FELIX in the issue prior to\neach U GM, containing all\nminutes, reports, motions and\nall matters to be discussed at the\nUG M.\"(I obviously did not\nquote this in full, I just use it to\nillustrate how badly thought out\nsome JDs are\u2014reproducing the\nminutes would mean an extra\npage at least in each FELIX). That the Union Directory was not\nproduced for the start of term\nFirstly, my job description says\n\"at the start of the session\".\nSecondly, last year was the first\ntime in several years that it was\nproduced for the start of session.\nThirdly, it was ready for\nprinting in the form that Mark\nSmith suggested that I paste it\nup in two weeks before the start\nof session. (Unfortunately his\n' idea to paste up the typed sheets\nand reduce it onto the plate\ninstead of reducing it first,\npasting it up and making the\nplate normally, did not work. So\nI was left the week before term\nstarted with twenty sheets to\nreduce from A3 to A4 and to\nthen paste up. I succeeded in\nreducing half of these sheets).\nPublicising the U GMa) This is the Publicity Officer's job (though I am \"res-pons i ble for (v) all Union\npublicity, overall, \").\nb)A Publicity Officer was not\nelected last term (no-one stood\nfor the post and, because the\nfirst Summer U GM last year was\nin q our ate, no nominations were\ntaken at the UG M).c)I told Steve that I doubted\nthat I would have time to do the\nposter at the Wednesday Exec\nmeeting.\nd) Steve arrives at the office\naround 9:00am, leaves around\n5:30/6:30pm has worked on\nFELIX( else why would he be\nChairman of the FELIX Club\nand go down there at 3:00pm each day for a cup of tea) and\nhas evenings off.\nIf anyone else knows of any\nother reasons why Steve thinks\nthat I was not doing my job I would like to know (but you will\nhave to hurry, I am \"allowed the\nuse of (this) room until the end\nof the month\"). I would also like\nto know why he (via first\nChristine and then John McCallion (whom I wish the\nbest of luck in his new job as\nDP)) was in such a hurry to get\nmy Union Office keys back on\nFriday evening after I had said\nthat I would need doing over the\nnext couple of weeks over the\nweekend (which) would be the\nonly time I had free, since I would be job and flat hunting\nduring his office hours), but\nthen I suppose he thought that I would do what he would do in\nmy situation and do something\nas childish as de story some\npapers or whatever. As he\nrefused my offer to help out, I presume he will now need\nsomeone to help in the office\nsorting out what needs doing. So\nif anyone has some spare time, I think Steve will (by the time you\nare reading this) be grateful of\nthe help.\nYours sincerely\nMary Freeman\nBSc(Eng) (Hons)\nPp ge4 October 29,1982 FELIX\n\n"

A motion instructing the Union Executive to\nsend her twenty red roses as a token of appreciation was heavily\ndefeated at Tuesday's Union General Meeting.\nThe controversy began when blame for the non-appearance of\nColin Cooper objected to\nPresident Stephen Goulder's report, on the grounds of factual\ninaccuracy over whether the\nHonorary Secretary was to\nAnti-sexism in action: Peter Burt\nmodelling the new Life Sciences\nsweatshirt.\nNo. 6 2 5 HH HH HM H1 the previous week's Exec News.\nA vote was taken, and despite a large number of abstentions a majority voted to refer the\nreport to the next U GM. Ultra Vires\nWhen the motion of Miss\nFreeman' s resignation was\nreached, the question of whether\nbuying roses was Ultra Vires\n(illegal under the Union Constituion) was raised by Stephen\nBishop, the C& GU President.\nThe question was left unresolved\nwhile Colin Cooper( newly\nelected to the Permanent Working Party) proposed the motion,\nwhich expressed regrets at the\ncircumstances of Miss Freeman's resignation, thanked her for her\nwork in the Union and ordered\nthe Union to buy her the roses.\nThe motion went unopposed\nuntil Christine Teller, last year's acting Deputy President, addressed the meeting. She said\nthat she had never liked Miss\nFreeman, who had at no time\nunderstood the Hon See's job.\nBitching Session\nMr Cooper replied that as the\nmeeting had now degenerated\ninto a 'bitching session', he\ncould point out that Miss Freeman had frequently worked\nfar later into the night than the\nrest of the Union staff, and that\nher job was made very difficult\nfor her by the dislike that the\nUnion staff showed her.\nMr Goulder then briefly lost\nhis temper while trying to submit\ninformation out of turn. When\nNick Pyne, the Chairman, had\nsilenced him, Jen Hardy-Smith\ncontinued on back page\nis\nThe Rector delivered a cautiously optimistic speech at Commemoration\nDay yesterday. In his address in the Albert Hall, he outlined the\ndifficulties that Imperial and the University of London had suffered in\nthe last year, but welcomed what he saw as a more rational approach by\nthe government after their earlier 'blind prejudice' against further\neducation.\nDP: McCallion\nTakes Over\nJohn McCallion, a third year\nmathematics student, was elected\nUnion Deputy President last\nweek. He takes the post left open\nwhen Deputy President-elect Phil\nGreenstreet failed his final exams\nlast summer.\nLast year Mr McCallion was\nappointed Rag Treasurer and\nsuccessfully resolved some of the\nconvoluted legal and financial\ndifficulties left by successive Rag\ncommittees. He will not be\nworking as a full-time salaried\nsabbatical officer, but he will be\navailable three afternoons a week in the Union Office.\nJohn McCallion\nI Friday, October 29,19821 IFree!\n\n"

    "content": "Sex Posters\nBanned\nControversy and humour were\nthe hallmarks of Tuesday's Union General Meeting, which\nwas ably( if eccentrically) chaired by Nick Pyne in a turban.\nIronically, in view of the\nUnion President's memo (printed\non page 4) the meeting was easily\nquo rate until the end of the\nmotion on Mary Freeman, which is covered elsewhere. The\nother motion to be discussed in\ndepth was on sexism and had\nbeen left over from the last,\nin quo rate, U GM. Sexism\nThe motion was proposed by\nSusan Watts and Louise Nah on, and expressed concern at the\nnumber of posters in College\nwhich offend women. Two amendments were passed,\nand the motion was carried by\nfour votes.\nThe result of this is that if\ntwenty members of the Union who find a poster offensive take\na petition to the Honorary Secretary or Union Publicity Officer (although both posts are\ncurrently vacant) the complaint\nwill be considered by the House\nCommittee. If it is upheld, the\noffending society will be fined in proportion to the number of\nposters displayed.\nElections\nMr Gould er( as acting Returning\nOfficer) announced that papers\nfor the post of Hon Sec had been\nposted on Monday and would come down on Friday, No vem ber 5.\nThe motion on Mary Freeman\nended at 2:25 and in face of the\nensuing exodus, Mr Pyne adjourned the meeting.\nSusan Watts, Louise Nahon and Nick Pyne\nUnaccountable\nBar-gains\nMany members of the Union are\nworried by repeated refusals to\npublish full accounts for the\nCollege bars, and by moves to\ndecrease Union influence in the\nrunning of refectories and bars.\nICU President Stephen Gould er has been accused of not keeping\nstudents informed of these events.\nRoy Francis, the Secretary of\nthe Bar sub-committee and an\nactive campaigner for more open\naccounts, was removed from the\ncommittee by the Academic Staff Assembly which he represents. He had been secretary for\nfour years.\nThe bar subcommittee's terms of reference are at present\nto report on bar policy and^ finance to the Refectory Committee and to advise and supervise the Refectory Manager's running of the bars. It comprises\nseven members, of whom two\nare students, and one of these (at\npresent Mr Gould er) must be\nchairman. A new set of terms of\nI reference will severely curtail the\nI committee's power, and the neS v chairman will be appointed by\nthe chairman of the Refectory\nCommittee, a post currently held\nby Dr Bob Schroter.\nMr Gould er told FELIX that\nhe did not believe that the changes would affect the Union's power on the com mii tee. He also\nsaid that the full accounts were\nnot made available to the committee because they would be open to misinterpretation by\npeople, who did not understand\nthem. He also pointed out that\nthe bars are all audited at regular\nintervals.\nA motion submitted to Tuesd ay' sU GM, instructing the Council to oppose the new terms\nof reference was not heard on\nTuesday because the meeting\nwas adjourned.

    "content": "REVIEW\nOld Fashioned\nBrilliance\nFive Days One Summer, produced and\ndirected by Fred Zinnemann opens\nThursday October 28 at Warner West\nEnd and Fulham ABC.\nFive Days One Summer is the latest film from\none of Hollywood's most experienced and\nprolific directors. Fred Zimmerman, whose.\ncareer stretches back to just before the war. It\nis, indeed, in this period, 1932 to be exact, that\nhe has chosen to place his new work.\nDespite the fact that Sean Connery, who\nplays Dr Meridith, will probably get the largest\nbilling in the publicity, and commands one's attention whilst on the screen, the central\ncharacter, Kate, is played by the unknown\nBetsy Brantley. The central character in any\nZimmerman film is usually in conflict with\nthemselves, and often with society (ie Sir\nThomas More in A Man For All Seasons) and\nas the story unfolds, her dilemma becomes\nclear: she is in love with an older married man.\nShe is by turns elated and depressed. Elated at\nlast to be with him on an alpine holiday;\ndepressed at the inevitable consequences of\nher action and turn between her feelings for\nthe young guide and her lifelong obsession\nwith her uncle.\nIn itself, a humdrum menage a trois, but the\nstory, meticulously told, is set against the\nbreathtaking backdrop of the alps. It is\nsobering in a time when our minds are numbed\nby special effects and dazzling sets that such\nan 'old fashioned' film, using merely the natural\nelements and brilliant photography, can be just\nas stunning.\nThe film is brought to a dramatic climax as\nthe audience try to identify the figure in the\nsnow, and try to read Kate's feelings in her\nface as she runs towards him.\nA beautifully made film, but I couldn't escape a feeling of deja vu. I'm sure that a film\nwith a very similar plot was made in the early\nfifties by a British studio, I just can't remember\nthe title. Could anyone enlighten me?\nLee Paddon\nMen of Arts\nand\nSilly Parts\nCommemoration Day starring Brian\nFlowers, Stephen Goulder, Professor\nJohn Albery and a cast of thousands.\nDirected by John Smith at the Royal\nAlbert Hall.\nThe lights dimmed and a deathly hush\nensued. This was the moment we had been\nwaiting for. Performed only once a year,\nCommemoration Day ranks with Gd t fer dd mmerung at the Bayreuth Festival and the\nPassion Play at Ober a mmer gau in the\ninternational artistic calendar. People had\ncome for and wide for this great event,\nA note on the organ, and a procession burst\nforth upon the aisle. And how easy it was to\nspot the familiar commedia dell'arte\ncharacters! All the stock figures were there:\ndunces, clowns, quacks and a liberal assortment of buffoons, all dressed gaily in\ntheir colourful robes. The procession marched\nslowly to the- front of the auditorium to the\naccompaniment of the most invigorating\nmusic. How proud the great Verdi would have\nbeen of this!\nBrian Flowers rose from his seat. A lifelong\nactor, his outstanding acting ability has taken\nhim to high places. But what a speech! What a truly magnificent speech, and what a great\nman! One is tempted recall the words of the\nVictorian poet and naturalist, Stanley Rum bold Meadows who died in tragic obscurity:\nOh mighty Zeus! Words stronger than thy\nsinewy limbs.\nOh Daphne! Words fairer than thy rounded\nbreasts,\nOh rapturous art! Oh fair creature from\nArcady!\nYes, words more profound than the Caves\nof Aad in the province of Baghdad,\nWords more thrusting than the hind legs of\nthe South American dung beetle,\nOh sweet rapture!\nOh divine rapture!\nOh heavenly bliss!\netc etc\nGreat though Flowers' oratory was, it was,\nalas, totally devoid of any gesticulation. A pity,\nsince a suitably placed gesture of the arm\ncould easily have provided his speech with the\nodd graceful flourish.\nJudging from his speech, Flowers is an\nangry man: he dealt with Mr sT's government,\nA pathetic wretch falls prostrate before the King (Sir Henry Fisher).\nAngel of Death? IRA terrorism as portrayed in Angel'.\nAngel, written and directed by Neil\nJordan, cert AA, opening at the Scala and\nParis Pullman on November 4.\nWhen saxophonist Danny witnesses the\nmurder of his band's manager and a deaf girl\nhe met at the gig, he is doomed to follow a Deafhiw'sh-like trail of revenge and murder to\nkill the IRA gang responsible.\nHis response is not immediate but once he\nhas acquired the gang's gun and killed its\nowner he sets about his task in earnest.\nObviously this plot is very serious but the\nfilm totally fails to convey this through weak\nacting and a loose narrative the only salient\npoint made is the anonymity and normality of\nthe murder gang in the fabric of society, other\ncomment on the Irish problem is non-existent.\nA non-Irish audience will find even less in the\nfilm (who is Dickie Rock? What is the Soldier's Song?) but some may recognise the high-ranking Jewish police officer Bloom from\nJoyce's Ulysses.\nAngel was made by the Motion Picture\nCompany of Ireland for the big screen but will\nshortly be shown on Channel 4. However\nprevious BBC productions about Northern\nIreland My Dear Palestrina and Shadows On\nOur Skin (whose star makes an appearance in\nAngel as a faith-healer) are much more\ninformed, relevant and also entertaining than\nAngel.\nPeter Rodgers\n[October 29,\ntyranny, the triumph of the individual over the\nstate, and the deplorable increase in the price\nof sausages. He is clearly a man with a mission,\nbut his speech fell short of an outright\ncondemnation of the human race. But, the\nlength! Even Hitler never spoke so long.\nMr Stephen Gould er then rose in his\ncapacity as the 'Student Orator' and delivered\na fine verbal display. This is a remarkable feat,\nconsidering Mr Goulder's speech impediment.\nIt is not widely known that an unfortunate\nincident befell Mr Goulder over the summer\nwhen he was mauled by a savage beast lurking\nin the depths of Hyde Park whilst on his way\nhome. (It is believed that he was mistaken for a bear in the evening light, and let's face it, this\ndoes seem a likely hypothesis in view of Mr Goulder's appearance). The extent of the\ndamage was such that Mr Goulder was rushed\noff to the Intensive Care Unit at London Zoo,\nand his remarkable recovery bears testimony\nto the gen u is of the NHS. But as Voltaire's Professor Pangloss would say, all bad things\nresult in something good, and the good side of\n\u2022the incident was that Dr Tony Haines was\ngiven a remarkable opportunity of writing fives\npapers on a most unusual topic. This was the\nreal reason for Dr Haines' promotion to\nWhitehall. There, one learns something new\nevery day, doesn't one? Now, where was I? Ah, yes! The Prisoners!\nThe stage thronged with prisoners (newly\n1982 \u2022 ^ \u2014 ^ \u2022 ^ M Prof John Albery as an unconvincing Great\nInquisitor\nelected graduates) rounded up after the war\n(waged by those in the procession)- And such\na pitiful sight they looked, dressed as they\nwere in black sackcloth with heads hung low.\nEach was summoned to the sinister king\n(played by Sir Henry Fisher) to be condemned\nto death. The incredibly evil High Priest (Brian\nFlowers) presided over this whole wretched\nbusiness. I shall never forget the hideous smile\non the King as the prisoners were condemned\nand the tragic indifference written across the\nface of the High Priest. Truly, these characters\nmust represent the most evil creations of our\ntime. The imminence of all these deaths was\nrepresented, at the end of the scene, by' a choir\nof the angelic host.\nThe Grand Inquisitor next struck upon the\nproceedings. Played by Professor John Albery\n(and described as the 'Staff Orator' in the\nprogramme notes), the man was clearly out of\nhis depth. It is sad to see a great actor taking\non a tragic role for which he is not suited. Prof\nAlbery is much better at light farce. The Grand\nInquisitor presented penitents, that is, reformed prisoners to the King.\nThe tragic indifference on the face of Flowers\n(consult text for fuller details).\nBrian Flowers as the monstrously wicked High\nPriest.\nYesterday's performance of Commemoration Day did not feature the 'Special Visitor'\n(always described as such in the programme\nnotes but who represents, of course, the\nGlorified Being (ie a god)). However in past\nperformances this character was always\nunconvincing and, at worst, confusing. The\nGlorified Being, having miraculously appeared,\nwas meant to impart advice to the wretched\nprisoners for the Hereafter, but always acted\nand behaved like an ordinary mortal. This has\nalways been the fault of the director, John\nSmith, who believes, naively, that such simplistic ideas would fool a British audience. If\nhe were only to take the obvious course and\nstand the character primly on a richly ornate\npedestal (in the Baroque style), or to herald his\narrival at the podium with a trumpet fanfare,\nthen there would never be any mis under standing. The absence of the Glorified Being\nyesterday made a very welcome break from\ntradition, and one can only hope that Smith\ndoesn't choose to revive this dreadful creation\nnext season.\nThe end of this epic drama was rounded off\nin a grand manner. With the maniacal ranting s on the organ signifying the anguish\nof the souls in purgatory, the prisoners\nsymbolically descended to the catacombs below the Royal Albert Hall. All in all this was\nan excellent performance, firmly reasserting\nthe work's place in the mainstream of British\npompous drama.\nStudent Standbys will be available next year\nat a price of 2V2p.

    "content": "With Tron (U, Odeon Leicester Square)\nDisney once more regain their position as\ngreat innovators in the field of movie making.\nBy using a dazzling mixture of live action,\nanimation and computer generated imagery\nthey have produced a timely fantasy utilising\nsome of the latest high technology effects.\nThe great breakthrough is, of course, the\nextensive use of Computer Generated\nImagery (henceforth, CGI). Director Steven\nLisberger conceived the story of TRON\nseveral years ago; acknowledging the immense\npopularity of video games he imagined a parallel electronic dimension where video\ngames were played out in a life and death\nstruggle between 'programs'. These programs\nare the alter-egos of their programmers (or\n'users') in the real world. CGI were the ideal\ntool to use for representing this imaginary\nelectronic world.\nThe film opens with a painful explanation of\nthe basic premise and we are introduced to\nFlynn, a former programmer from EN COM(a communications conglomerate) who now runs\na video arcade. He is busy at aV DU tapping\ninto the EN COM information system in order\nto prove that Dillinger (now in control of\nENCOM) perpetrated the most ghastly and\ntrendy crime imaginable\u2014he stole Flynn's brilliant video programs for Space Paranoids\nand several other successful games.\nIn the electronic world we see Clu, an\nelectronic warrior who looks like Flynn,\nattempting to evade capture by the henchmen\nof Sark (the electronic alter-ego of Dillinger).\nHe is captured and executed, or rather 'de-rez zed'( de-resolution!), and disappears from\nthe games grid.\nThese scenes are in the deep blue, glowing\nelectronic world but...mean u>r iiie back in the\nreal world...(as a caption tells us) Dillinger is\nsummoned by the evil M CP( Master Control\nProgram) that he created and warned of\nFlynn's interference. Access to the EN COM system is restricted, but Alan and Lora (two of\nFlynn's friends) warn him. In a final attempt to\ngain the evidence he requires Flynn is\nsmuggled into EN COM to gain direct access.\nBut this time the M CP fights back\u2014Flynn is\ndigitised and physically transported into the\nelectronic world (a la Wizard of Oz).\nWell all this sounds pretty ingenious, but it is\nnot until this point the film really takes off.\nFlynn is trapped in a totally alien world ruled\nREVIEWS\nby the M CP and has to battle against Sark in\nan electronic arena for survival. He meets\nTRON, mightiest of the video warriors, who is\na program designed by Alan to monitor the\naccumulation of information in the system.\nThe tyrannical Sark thus attempts to stop\nTRON and Flynn reaching the heart of the\nCPU and overthrowing the M CP. The CGI is mainly used for creating\nvehicles; Sark commands a massive floating\ncarrier from which he controls a force of tanks\nand recognizer s( floating vehicles which stomp\non renegade programs with cartoon elegance).\nThe most impressive sequence is undoubtedly\nduring a game where amazing light-cycles\nenvelop the players (achieved with hand\nanimation) and then rush off in computer\ngenerated vehicles to make their opponents\ncrash.\nThese sequences were created by the\nMathematical Applications Group Inc (MAGI)\nusing a fascinating system called Synthavision.\nFor the uninitiated, there are several ways of\ngenerating computer images which have been\ndeveloped over the past twenty years or so.\nSynthavision was originally designed by\nphysicists trying to simulate the path taken by\nnuclear particles in radiation experiments. By\nreplacing particle rays with light rays it\nsynthesis es photography by tracing a light\nbeam (in reverse) from an imaginary camera to\nan imaginary object. When this beam strikes\nthe object additional information on the\nposition of light source, texture, reflectivity\nand so on complete the picture for that point.\nBy repeating the process for the whole field of\nview a picture is 'painted' electronically and,\nwith enough information, can have totally\nconvincing shading and perspective.\nAnother system used on the film by\nInformation International Inc (or Triple-I) involves forming an object from a large\nnumber of flat polygons, with curves being\nsmoothed out by various averaging processes.\nThe problem here for many years was that a complete description of the 3-D object was\nprogrammed in and the computer had to then\ndecide which pieces of hidden detail should be\nremoved when looking from any particular\nviewpoint. This takes a lot of computing time\nand only recently have people been able to\nspeed up the process using bigger and better\ncomputers.\nMAGI's Synthavision process ingeniously\ncircumvents this need. Dr Philip Mittelman of\nMAGI explains that his physicists needed to\ndeal with solid objects in their radiation\nsimulations and hence created a set of 3-D 'primitives' from which an object could be\nformed (eg sphere, cube, ellipsoid). By adding\nand subtracting these 3-D units an object is\nSark (David Warner) backed by one of the few disappointing creations-the MCP (a sort of rainbow\ncoloured whirlpool). As Sark's power increased the vein-like circuits of his suit glow brighter.\nOne of the marvellous computer generated light-cycles.\ngenerated so that the light beam from the\nimaginary camera merely recognises the first\nsurface it strikes\u2014hence no hidden detail\nproblem!\nThis is, of course, a very superficial\ndescription of the computer imaging process.\nIt is impossible to go into too much detail here\n(for those interested I suggest you consult a textbook or issues six and eight of a marvellous American effects magazine called\nCinefex for an introduction) but the\npossibilities that these techniques represent\nwill undoubtedly revolution is e the film industry\nin future years\u2014imagine creating a totally\nconvincing spacecraft (without the need for\nmodels) taking over with a joystick on your\nV DU and simply sailing through a predetermined background sequence. All the\nmoves will be stored in memory, so to correct\na mistake there would be no need for the\ncostly re-shooting of film\u2014just recall from\nmemory and do it again! It is not until the\nwhole scene (or film) is complete that the\ntransfer to film is even necessary.\nIndeed, what Star Wars did for motion\ncontrol photography (models, bluescreen s, computer controlled motion systems etc)\nTRON should do for CGI. Within a few years\nthere will probably be a host of imitators and\neven George Lucas is ploughing money into\nhis own CGI unit\u2014for a future part of the\nStar Wars saga no doubt. Besides this many\nother aspects of image processing, from the\nwork done on satellite photographs to the\ndevelopment of 'user friendly' interfaces (like\ndata tablets on which artists can paint with an\nelectronic brush) will soon be spilling into the\nentertainment industry. Digital film printers,\nelectronic compositing and high resolution\nvideo will become standard tools.\nTRON itself is just a start and it's not a great\nfilm by any means. Some ridiculous ideas and\nacting don't complement the more ingenious\neffects too well.\nBruce Boxleitner (Who?) as TRON is far too\nw impish and Jeff Bridges portrays Flynn as a wisecracking idiot who couldn't possibly know\na bit (byte) if he saw one.\nHowever, there is some punchy dialogue\n(for instance, when the M CP threatens Sark\nwith banishment to a pocket calculator) and\nthe 53 minutes of film in the electronic\ndimension is just staggering. Of this about\nfifteen minutes is achieved using CGI and the\nrest is live action enhanced with hand\nanimation.\nThis is another revolutionary technique; the\nlive action was all shot in black and white,\nblown up onto 12y2 x20 inch transparent eels\ncoloured using back-lit animation. This is very\nmuch like standard Disney animation, except\nthat the eels on the animation stand are\nilluminated from behind (rather than above)\nwith various colours to achieve the pulsing\nelectric suits the actors wear.\nThere are many more faults with the film but\noverall it is harmless fun and at times very\nentertaining (if you can see past the acting). As\na demonstration of the potential effects of\ncomputer graphics in the entertainment\nindustry it is a milestone and, for.this reason\nalone, should not be missed.\nFlUXl |October 29,1982 Poge7|\n\n"
