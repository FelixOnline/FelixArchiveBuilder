    "content": "What' sOn Only ten pages this week folks, but don't worry! I 've managed to recruit a few new staff\nmembers and have thus spent a lot of time\nexplaining the various stages of FELIX production. As soon as they are more confident things will speed up and a regular\ntwelve or sixteen page issue will (hopefully) be\npossible.\nA mere ten pages means that I 've had to be a little severe and chop a few articles and small\nads. It couldn't be helped and I 'll try to include\nthem next week.\nCopy Deadline I 'll have to go on and on about this until I'm blue in the face, but here goes\nAny article for inclusion in Friday's FELIX must reach the office not later than 1:30pm Monday. Now that we've all settled in, I will\nhave no qualms about destroying anything\nreceived after this time.\nRefectory flats\nIt disappoints me that John Smith, the\nCollege Secretary has not replied to the\npoints raised by Mr Marshall in FELIX591. The main question is, why are these flats left\nempty for long periods of time while accommodation in London is so scarce?\nU GM Inadequacy\nEven though the motion on Iranian students\nwas passed at the last UG M,I was dismayed\nto discover that the proposer of the motion\nwas not in fact a student of this College.\nAdmittedly, the situation is fairly difficult in\nthis case, but surely this should have been\nexplained to the meeting and their permission asked to hear an external proposer. Instead the decision was made by\nthe U GM Chairman, Stephen Goulder, who\nwill hopefully keep the meeting fully\ninformed in the future. Pass the sick-bag,\nAlice!\nDavid Owen\nWhilst being pleased that Doctor Owen should come to our College and lecture on\nthe S DP,I was rather disappointed that he\ngave such a dull and boring speech. I popped in at the back of the Great Hall and\nafter ten minutes found the prospect of a hard afternoon's slog on FELIX more appealing. Whatever happened to inspiring\noratory and exciting commentary?\nThe Credits\nMy grateful thanks to the following people;\nMartin, Steve, Shams (to whom I grovelling ly apologise), Debbie, Jane, Paul, Peter, Eddie,\nStephen, Moe z, Richard, Michael, Lesley\n(you're wonderful), Dave and friend, Phil,\nSteve Groves, Maz and Ian.\nWhen General Reisenschein arrested seven\ndissidents on a charge of suspected SDP tendencies, he instructed his jailer to put A in\nthe first cell, B in the second, and so on round\nto G, starting next to the entrance and working anti-clockwise. Alas, the jailer thought\nhe said clockwise, and when he found out his\nmistake the prisoners had already been\nallocated cells as shown in the diagram.\nFortunately, all is not lost, for although to\nallow two prisoners to see each other before\ninterrogation would be a serious breach of\nsecurity, and to allow any of them through the\nmain gate would be unthinkable, it is quite\npermissible to leave a prisoner locked in the\nkeyhole-shaped area in the centre. .\nBut unlocking andre locking doors is\ntedious, jailer wants to go to bed; so can you\nhelp him by showing how he can get A into the\ncell where G now is, and the others following\non in alphabetical order anticlockwise round\nthe ring, using the smallest number of moves.\nSolutions, comments and criticisms to me at\nthe FELIX Office by next Wednesday 1:00pm please. There is a \u00a35 prize (donated by Menda-Bike) for the correct entry randomly\nselected at that time.\nThe solution to the puzzle in the Freshers'\nFELIX is\nRichard Beit Civ Eng\nSimon Southside DoC Tim Garden Biochem\nQuentin Weeks Aeronautics\nThe winner is Chris Bannock, Physics 2.\nThe solution to the handbook puzzle: first E, followed by D,B, A and C in that order. B told\nthe others that only E had beaten him. This\nprize was won by Jonathan Holmes, Physics 1.\nThe cheques can be collected from the FELIX Office from Monday afternoon.\nAnd as for last week's quickies, there are\nmany single-syllable words with eight letters:\nSTRENGTH, THOUGHTS, STRAPPED etc.\nSTRETCHED has nine, and there doesn't seem to be a reason why there shouldn't be a ten-letter one. ( S CR A UN CHED?) There are three six \"letter words with no\nvowels. RHYTHM is fairly obvious, and if\nRHYTHMS is a word, then there's a seven\nletter one. DRY FLY is a technique in fishing,\nand there's the lovely astronomical term\nSY ZY GY. The only word 1 know with five consecutive\nvowels is QUEUE1 NG, and the word which\nstarts with seven consecutive consonants and\nends with nine is STRYCHNINE.( Oh, you\nthought I meant !).\nFriday, October 16\n\u2022 Library Meeting,1:00 pm, Lounge above Stans.\n\u2022 Christian Union Fellowship Evening,6:30 pm,53 Princes Gate (Music Room).

I was\na little disappointed with the\nletters page however, what is\nthe use of all this boring, verbose and generally unreadable rubbish.' The letter\nof Mr Smith is the obvious\nexample; it seems to be 2 ' / ,\ncolumns too long. Mr Gould er is ec|u ally boring, but at least\nhe has an amusing grandiloquent style.\nPersonally I prefer the trite\nbickering of the B SH44 hit\nsquad( now the B SH re-ap hit\nsquads). At least they show evidence ot, a sense of humour, even if it is of the type anthropologists usually con.nect with Hom oNe anc leitha lis. I hope you get some good\n(short) letters soon.\n3 ours sincerely\nJ. Hol lier. Zoo3 PS: Whatever happened to\nCaptain Lindley jokes, it has\nnot been mentioned for two\n(2) whole copies.\nEd's. Wile: No, no, no, no,\nno, no. I just cannot accept\nthat. I don't knowhow many Captain Lindley jokes have\nappeared \u2014 I don't stand and count them and it's not up to\nme to count them either! Now let's get this straight. I'm not just here to humU i ate senior members of the College administration and that's a fact. I don't know when I'll start, but if Ido it' ll be done properly I can tell you! During the li r sHe w days of\nterm we were subjected to\nmassive amounts of ad vert ising\nby the Conservative Society. I would like the opportunity to\nrespond in ac ju ie ter and more serious manner, without resorting to slogans or insults.\nThe majority of socialists\nare not power. crazed dictators in the making. They are in fact motivated more by\nconcern for people less for tu nate than themselves, and for\nt he c nv ironmen t which belongs to all people equally. They are concerned less\nwith being powerful and wealthy than with trying to\nachieve a fairer distribution of\nwealth. If this were not the\ncase, then they would indeed be better advised to support the Conservative Party. Socialism has not yet been\nachieved; we neither support nor wish to emulate the Russian system of Communism. But Russia is the li rst example Conservatives quote\nthat Socialism doesn't work; well neither is Capitalism working, as the world recession\nand this present Government have shown. Industries are\nclosing down, unemployment is going up, inflation is still\nabove10%, public services\u2014I would even say some basic\nhuman rights like education \u2014\nare being cut. Ordinary people's standards of living are falling; income tax cuts\n\u2022really benefit only those who pay high taxes, and anyone who pays high taxes has enough money already. II you' re concerned for other people first, and for securing yourself a bright future second, please come to\nIC Socialist Society meetings\non Thursday evenings at\nG:30p m,in the Green Committee Room( to]) floor. Union Building). Last week\nwe had slides and a speaker\nfrom Campaign Against Arms Trade; next Tuesday's meeting should include a speaker from S VVA PO( of.\nNamibia) to be followed by a discussion.\n) ours sincerely\nRobert Kel s cy Ci vEng2 Please slop taking down our\nposters. Il wastes my lime and\nIn ion money.\nSir\nIn my per am bulat ions round the College last week I observed a large number of\nposters produced by the Federation of Conservative Stu dents ( FCS) and put up by our very own local branch of that\norganisation the IC Conservative Society. Some of the posters took quotations from leaders to the Social Democratic and the Labour parties\ncompletely out of the context\nin which they were org in ally made and presented them in a manner which was misleading to say the least. In the case of\nthe ' Social Democratic' poster\nit was not immediately appa rent on ali rst glance at the\nposter that it was aFC S poster; such a poster therefore\ncomes into the odious category\nof black propaganda. The very fact that the Conservative party is prepared to use such\ntactics is an admission of weak ness. They have no arguments by which they can defend\nwhat they laughingly call policies; they have to attack others\nin order to justify to them selves their very existence \u2014 a piece of dialectic if ever there\nwas.\nThe posters which were produced cost money. Something that the Government has been assuring us for the past\ntwo and a half years is in very\nshort supply. It would thus\nseem that the Government is\nprepared to cut education so\nthat it is now a privilege and not a right, but pay for ex pen sive posters in order to try and discredit their opponents.\n} ours sincerely\nFrank James\nSir\nReturning to College alter\nths summer vacation brings\nmy mind back to that traditional student subject: beer.\nHow much longer must students at IC endure the\nremarkably unpalatable liquids available at various points around the College? South sideBar professes to\n\u00abell real ale \u2014 maybe it does,\nbut is any beer costing 50p or\nmore a pint worth purchasing if it, as it does, tastes of sick.\nMay I ask whoever is responsible for the conditioning of\nthe beer, if they feel that their\npipe cleaning and flushing isa d equate or do they have some other good excuse for\nthe deplorable standard of the\nbeer?\nKeg beer, as I understand it. is designed to give a beer ol great consistency (even though it may be too Fizzy and of poor taste to many). The J CR surpasses itself in the consistency\nof its keg beers\u2014consistently\nbad. Please, can something be\ndone. Can the College either\nemploy bar stall who under stand the business they are\nbeing employed in or can the\nbreweries be asked to explain to them how to keep beer?\nAnd finally (Esther), to all fresher s who like a good pint \u2014 forget the College bars,\ncontact mean dI will be\npleased to tell them where there are pubs selling good\nbeer nearby.) ours hopefully\nMG Robinson Sir\nThis College is very preoccupied with safety, as it\nshould be. but the organisers\nof the Freshers' Fair appear to\nhave neglected any consider ation of safety by placing both the judo Club and the Fencing Club in the Gym. This in itself would have been relatively, though not completely, safe but by taking up one\nquarter of the available floor\nspace with chairs from another part of the building made the\ngym a very dangerous place\nlor both spectators and demonstrators.\nWhen the rec pie st for the\nuse of the gym during the\nFreshers' Fair was submitted it was specifically requested\nthat the whole of the floor\nspace be available to the Judo Club. This request was not\nmade for any sell ish reason\nbut for the protection of both the demonstrators. Luckily no serious accident occured, the\nonly accident was someone\nlanding off the mat on the\ngym floor and getting a slight\nbruise.\nThe mat width being only two and a hall mat lengths\nseriously limited any demonstration put on, in fact it\nmeant none of the planned demonstrations could be used.\nThe separation of the two\ndemonstration areas was also\nPage 2 FELIX, October 16, 1981\n\n"

Such people are called \"Prisoners of\nConscience\".\nAmnesty International opposes torture,\ninhuman treatment and capital punishment in\nail cases and without reservation.\nAmnesty International is strictly non-political. It works for Prisoners of Conscience\nin countries as diverse as El Salvador, Russia,\nSouth Africa and Iran.\nFor anyone who missed the Amnesty\nInternational stall at Freshers' Fair (because\nthere wasn't one) this meeting is to re-launch\nIC Amnesty Group.

A group of eight\nmembers drove to Duxford on June 28 with\nthree gliders: a Bocian two-seater, a club\nLibeile and an Astir single seater.\nThe competition began the following day\nwith teams from Cambridge (the hosts),\nEdinburgh, Salford, Surrey, Birmingham,\nWales. Leicester and Nottingham. The aim of\nthe exercise was to fly a set course, generally\nstarting and finishing at Duxford. Each glider\nwas handicapped, points being awarded for\ndistance travelled along the course and speed.\nTo make this fairer the gliders were divided\nI into two classes: one for glass fibre models and\none for wood/fabric/metal. The Astir and Club\nLibelle comprised 40% of the glass-fibre class,\nwhile the Bocian was one of twelve lower\nperformance gliders.\nThe first day was notable in that it was the\nonly day when more than 50% of the gliders\nmade it back to Duxford, including two of the\nIC gliders. The third glider, the Astir, made a somewhat unconventional landing on an\nI airstrip in a cornfield, but was subsequently\nj found to be OK to fly, leaving us still with our\nPage 6 FELIX, October 16, 1981\n\n"

Main s adaptors can be used to recharge the\nrechargeable batteries in some types of\nequipment. The primary and rechargeable\nbatteries in common use have the same\ndimensions and are physically interchange\nable, so the only way of finding out which is in\nuse is by inspection. If mains adaptors are used\nwith equipment fitted with primary batteries\nand these are not automatically disconnected,\nthe resulting attempt to \" recharge\" the\nprimary batteries may result in a minor explosion.\nThis problem cannot be easily overcome by\nmodification of the equipment and it is advised\nthat the equipment be labelled to indicate the\ntype of battery in use, e.g. \"Rechargeable\ncells\" or \"Primary batteries, to be removed\nbefore using mains adaptor\".\nFELIX, October 16, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Going for a song\nIC student sings in Beethoven's house\nAustin Allen is at Imperial\nCollege for one year working in nuclear technology\nfor BNF Ltd. Today, Friday,\nOctober 16, sponsored by\nAir UK, he will sing a recital of Beethoven's music in Beethoven's house in Bonn.\nAustin is from the West Riding of Yorkshire and spent\nten v ears at the University of Bradford. While he was at the\nuniversity he began singing with the ' Coronet Quartet' from Halifax. A little over live\nyears ago, l our soloists \u2014 Sheila Simpson, Margaret Tennant, Roy Sykes and Austin \u2014 were invited to give a e once rl in Halifax and have sung tog ether sine e then as the' Coronet Quartet'. Together with performances at the Edinburgh Festival, broad casts for BBC and concert\nrous in England, the quartet visited ' Der Kleine Madrigal chor' in Aachen \u2014 the twin town of Halifax \u2014 in1980. The small student choir returned the visit at Easter this year and sang several\nconcerts with the Coronet Quartet including an appear ance at West minister Abbey. The choir are giving two special concerts in Aachen and Du sseldorf \u2014 singing music by J ii rgB aur in the\npresence of the composer \u2014\nand would have liked the quartet to again b.e their guests. Unfortunately, the other members of the quartet\nare unable to travel to Germany in October and so\nAustin is singing with Der Kleine Madrigal chor on his\nown as their guest. He has\nchosen a programme of British music for the occasion\nand will singsongs by Purcell, folk song arrangements by\nBritten, some Victorian ballads and, by special request\nof the choir, some Gilbert Sullivan \u2014 the choir fell in love with Gilbert and Sullivan when the quartet included' Contemplative Fashion' and' Regular Royal Queen' in the\n1980 programme. Paul Iredale, the concert\npianist from Ell and is travelling with Austin as his accompanist. Paul accompanied the\nquartet in the tour in1980 and when he visited the Beethoven haus in Bonn he\nplayed an impromptu recital\nby request of the \" Dire kt or\". Unfortunately, he had no Beethoven in his current repertoire and played Chopin and Schubert instead. When the Beethoven haus knew that\nAustin and Paul would be in Germany, they invited them to give a recital and. to make amends, Austin has chosen\nentirely Beethoven's music. He will sing the cantata' Adelaide' and the song-cycle\n' Andie fe meG elie btc' and Paul's fiancee, Elizabeth Saunders, also on tour, . will play Beethoven's Piano Sonata No3 in E Hat. The party is\ncompleted by John Dunn, the\npoet from University College, a friend of Austin' s who \"is\nlooking alter the three musicians in Germany. Air UK are generously sponsoring the tout by Hying the party out to Amsterdam from Leeds Airport. Air UK Hew Austin to Ireland recently\nwhen he sang with the University of Bradford Chamber Choir in Dublin, Kilkenny and Bray. On that occasion\nAustin sanga recital of international folksongs and the world premiere of ' Wedding Songs' by Andrew Ford, the Fellow in Music at the\nUniversity of Bradford. When Austin finishes at\nImperial College he will learn the role of John Allan( Edgar Allan Poe's father, in I 'oe:\n7 mor ol ll u Soul, an opera a( present being written by Andrew Ford and Graham Dev lin. IC Refectory Committee\nproudly presents the return of the\n50p PINT\nin the Union and Southside.\nTake advantage of this amazingly generous bargain as it\nis for a LIMITED PERIOD\nONLY.\nAll draught bitters in the Union\nand at least one in Southside will be\nheld at 50pa pint for the period\nSunday, October 4 to Saturday,\nOctober 31 inclusive.\nEXEC VIEWS\nNick\nI was pleased to see a well attended, interesting U GM last week. But\nwhere were the rest of you? Anyway, whether or not you were at that\nmeeting you can help us all out with a minimum of effort.\nThe meeting passed a motion to write letters to MPs to defend\nourselves against the cuts. The External Affairs Officer and I have drawn\nup a standard letter and it has now been duplicated. Copies are available\nin the Union Office along with a list of MPs. All we are asking you to do is\nsign a copy, put your home address on it and we will mail it to your MP. Simple. If you have the time to make it more personal you can write it out\nin your own handwriting. There is little point in doing this unless we\nhave a lot of letters. Please pop over and help this campaign.\nFinally (for this week anyway) on the cuts, would those people who\nwanted to go on the Salford demonstration please come and see me in the\noffice today.\nBarney\nFirst of all I'd like to say that I'm very sorry to have caused Judo Club\nand Fencing Club so much trouble during the Freshers' Fair and to\nassure them that I shall advise my successor not to make this same\nmistake. Now I'd like to apologise to 'Wargames' for the disgraceful way\nin which they were driven out of the S CR by R CSU beer drinkers.\nHowever, I must emphasize to anyone using the Union Building or its\nfacilities that if there is a problem then the sooner they tell me the sooner\nit will get rectified (actually I'm quite good at sorting out these sorts\nof problems).\nIf you've a complaint please come up to the Union Office and fill in an\n\"official apology from the DP\" form and get me to sign it.\nPS: If your club or society needs storage space, e.g. a cupboard or a room then drop me a line and I 'll see what I can do.\nPage 4 FEUX, October 16, 1981\n\n"

Wells Society sat\nagog last Monday night to witness a startling demonstration\nof hypnosis. Martin S Taylor, an IC postgraduate and a Member of the Magic Circle gave an impromptu talk and\ndemonstration at only a few hours' notice after Prof Eric\nLaithwaite reported sick with flu.\nAfter a brief introductory talk. Martin quickly hypnotised Iburteen volunteers together with a member of the audience who went into a trance in his seat.\nMartin then went on to induce a number of remarkable physical effects in his subjects: catalepsy, in which subjects were\nunable to bend their arms until released by the hypnotist,\nanalgesia, in which the skin within a septa te drawn on the\nsubject'shand became so numb that he could not feel a pinprick, selective deafness, in which subjects could hear nothing until the v felt the hypnotist touch their hands, art el amnesia, in which subjects could not remember what had happened to them. Also there was some very entertaining effects: most ol them were\nsuggested by the audience: subjects were told they were orchestral musicians and pre cee ded to play imaginary instruments with great gusto. One subject became an orator and gave a particularly moving speech consisting only ol the fu st four letters of the\nalphabet. Some were told that the v would lind an ordinary piece\nof prose enormously funny and they split their sides laughing at a description of Well soe( alright, maybe that is no l so odd after\nall...). They sheltered from an imaginary shower of rain and a biting cold spell. When told it was unbearably hot \u2014 no, they did not take their clothes oil, but the v looked distinctly ready to.\nThe highlight of the evening came when one subject was told that\nwhen he looked through a pair ol spectacles made Biggies-style\nI rom his lingers and thumbs he would he able to sec through everyones' clothes. His expression and length ol time he spent\nusing his new magic spectacles was simply hilarious. Hre was told\nthat t he effect would last alter he came out of t he tra nee and sure\nenough he was still gazing through his lingers w hen the audience left at the end of the lecture.

After the traditional Ring O 'Roses\naround Eros, everybody adjourned to the Cockney Pride for a well\ndeserved drink. (Photo: Steve Groves)\nDr Owen\nLabours On\nDr David Owen, founder member of the Social Democratic Party, delivered an address to a packed audience on Tuesday in the Great Hall. Emphasising the need to be aware of a distinction between\nmarket and public sector economies, he claimed that the private sector has not flourished due to indiscriminately applied rules\nand regulations and that the amalgamation of public and private has lead to the \" worst oft wo world s\".Dr Owen criticised\nnationalised industries, pointing out that they did not relate to\nmarket trends and should be fragmented to achieve better\nrunning and productivity. He said that one of the aims of the\nSocial Democrats was to achieve decentralisation, giving the\nhealth service as an example. On the role of his party, he said that there is no single course\nol action in overcoming the country' s problems, but that a series\nol \" marginal\" adjustments \" has to be made\". Challenged by a member of the audience who said that the\nS DPs have no leader, Dr Owen defended his position by saying that too much importance was attached to having a leader and' that people were misguided in\" ape ing the presidential system\". Dr Owen also spoke in favour of reduced taxation, arms control and disarmament. He stressed the need for an improved health service for which people will have to pay. With regard to\neducation, the SD Pvv ill allow independent schools to continue but without financial support from the government.\" We aim to make interventions which are well judged, well thought out \u2014 to last,\" said Dr Owen.

    "content": "Oblomov\nOblomov (U)( Nikita Mikhalkov, 1979,\nUSSR) 140 mins, subtitles. Now showing\nat the Paris Pullman. Certificate U. Oblomov. The problem of work, or rather its\nethic, personified into a gentle Oblomov and\nhis classical foil Stoltz. This conflict, which\ngives the film an underlying tension, is\nswaddled in a simple plot that offers barely no\nrestriction to the development of the central\ncharacters. Oblomov will not get up, his best\nfriend, Stoltz, will not lie down. The story\nunwinds.\nOblomov is a gentleman, Stoltz his family's protege. The disparity of the two is further\nenhanced by differing nationalities (Qblmov\nRussian, Stoltz German) which together with\ntheir physique and outlook is juxtaposed to\ntheir friendship.\nThis really is a film of images rather than a continuous thread, a personalised view of\nhumanity that is abstracted to the point of\nbeing out of time, a reflection of the timeless\nconflict sO blom ov encounters in his relationship with others.\nWhen Oblomov is eventually stirred it is not\ndue to the ex or tat ions of Stol tz or his\nworsening financial circumstances, but it is\nrather the personal experience of love that\nmoves him into the 'social' world. He is\nthwarted and loses the object of his desire to\nStoltz but it is indicative of the isolation of\nOblomov that Clara, the prize of a ritual is ed and barely acknowledged competition, is\nhardly more than a caricature, is ephemeral\nand the loss of the object is almost incidental\nto the sense of failure portrayed by Obiomov.\nHis childhood, unfolded by a series of\nflashbacks, is enchantingly photographed and\nreligiously sentiment af with a brightly lit figure\nmoving through a pastel and ever receding\nbackground. These scenes provide justification for the philosophy Oblomov expounds\nduring t ffe film. Stol tz, the friendly but\npawn like businessman, is eventually shown as\npassing through the tragedy of others with a terrifying moral impunity. Even his \" trappings\", such as his childlike wife, are\nportrayed as hardly impinging on his narrow-minded, finally caged, self.\nThe film ends with a scene almost identical\nto the opening shots\u2014a child running across\nan undefined plane calling \"Mother\". This\nreference to mother, together with the 'closed\ncycle' of similar opening and closing, are tied in\nwith Oblomov's reasoning to make the whole\nenterprise a moral exposition embodied by\ncharacters but eventually greater than the\nindividual.\nA simple, beautifully crafted and very\nRussian film.\nHistory of the\nWorld (Parti)\nCertificate AA. Starring Mel Brooks,\nMadelaine Kahn, Pamela Stephenson.\nDirected by Mel Brooks. Now showing all\nover London.\nHey folks! Give ear! You've read the school\ntextbooks, now see the film: only don't expect\nthe same thing! But has Mel Brooks really rewritten history, or has he merely pointed out\nsome of the detail that historians have,\nthroughout ages, considered a little...well...\nnaughty? Or is there any truth in the rumour\nthat history itself is subjected to D notices\nfrom someone in a rather high ish position, ff\nthis is so then fear nO more, people of the\nworld! You shall forever be illuminated, for this\nis the HISTORY OF THE WORLD( Part One,\nto be precise); and its star/producer/writer/\ndirector, Mr Mel Brooks, in his own modest\nway calls it an 'epic'.\nHistory of the World Part One is the sort of\nstuff that would make C.B. De Mille and D.W. Griffith turn, nay, rotate in their graves. The\nfilm starts at the dawn of mankind and goes on\nto the stone age, the Roman Empire, the\nSpanish Inquisition and the French Revolution,\nall being narrated throughout by Orson Wells\n(whose laryngitis has got considerably better,\nso it seems). The film is in the typical zany\nMel Brooks style, though, for my taste, the\nslapstick often becomes a little too monotonous. Even though the cinema audience wasn't exactly rolling over the aisle with laughter, the\nfilm definitely has its moments of originality,\nand is worth seeing, if only for these. It isn't the\nbest comedy of the year, and def in it ly not the\nbest Mel Brooks comedy, but it's worth a try\nanyway. Also starring in the film is Pamela\nStephenson, who is as charming and sexy as\never.\nSo, if you want to see what the stone age\nmen really got up to, if you want to meet\nEmpress Nympho \"the sultry, sensuous, sinful\nse duc tress of all Rome\", if you want to go to\nLouis the XVIth's court and find out what a Garcon-de-piss e is, then (in his own words\nagain) Mel Brooks is going to tell you \"....the\nwhole truth, whether it's true or not\". Amen.\nPhilip\nGoing down\nReally well\nThe five-piece rock band 'Really' caused quite\na stir at the Guilds' Fresher s' Party last\nThursday. The usual half-hour spot reserved\nfor entertainers was lengthened by the two\nencores demanded by the impressed IC\ncrowd.\nAll members of the band agreed that they\nhad enjoyed playing in the J CR and were\npleased with the sound that they had made.\nLead vocalist, Marian, and bass and lead\nguitarists Dave and Mark claim to be strongly\ninfluenced by Elvis Costello whom they have\nsupported in concert. Bass player Dave seems\nmore reminiscent of a bald Ian Dury.\nReally played in the Union Concert Hall as\nsupport band to Wild Willy Barrett and John\nOtway last term and I'm sure that the IC ENTS Committee( not represented at the party\nincidentally) will be keen to give Really another\nbooking.\nMeanwhile for those of you who would like\nanother chance to see the Leeds-based band,\ntheir next gig is at the Moonlight Club, West\nHampstead on October 29.\nThe Sports Centre on the north side ol\nPrince's Gardens may he used by all members of the College and their guests.

You can find out about the challenge of marketing\nmanagement by spending five days on Procter & Gamble's Marketing Vacation Course.\nWe arc one of the most successful manufacturers of fast m ovi consumer goods in the world and acknowledged leaders in\nthe marketing management field. The UK Company\nmarkets such household names as Ariel. Fairy Liquid.\nHead & Shoulders, Crest, Flash, Daz and Camay.\nBetween 14th and 18th December, we will b running an informal, but intensive,\nmarketing management course for a group\nof final year undergraduates at our Head\nOffice. Full accommodation and all expenses\nwill be paid. During the Course you will\nactively participate in business projects\nranging from product development and\nconsumer research to television advertising\nand in-s torc promotion. They will give you a real feel of the challenge, intellectual\ns ii mul ation and enjoyment of marketing\nmanagement, and insight into the broad\nrange of activities involved. You will also\nhave a chance to meet some of the wide\nvariation of people with whom a marketing\nmanager works.\nIf you are interested in learning about\nMarketing Management, you should apply\nas soon as possible.\nPlease ring Steve Philpott. reversing the\ncharges on Newcastle upon Tyne 857141.\nor write to him c/o Brand Promotion\nDivision, Procter & Gamble Limited, P.O.

The second day\nwas the only non-flying day, owing to a howling\ngale which grounded everything, so we spent\nthe day navigating the Cam in a punt.\nThe remaining days were all fly able, though\nthe tasks set tended to be rather ambitious, i.e. almost everyone landed out in fields every day.\nOn the fourth day five gliders landed within a few minutes of each other in a small field some\ndistance from the airfield. The field wasn'ta particularly good one for landing in, but after\none glider had landed there the rest just\nfollowed. On the final day eight gliders came\ndown at RAF Henlow, including all three IC\ngliders.\nIt was generally agreed that the competition\nwas good fun and well worth entering. The two\nglass gliders came second and fourth out of a field of five, but our star performance was the\nBocian which worked its way up the field to\ncome third out of twelve.\nThe Gliding Club not only takes part in\ncompetitions, but also trains pilots. If you think\nyou might like to learn to fly why not come\nalong to one of our meetings every Thursday\nat 5:30pm in Aero 254; new members are\nalways welcome.\nSF Soc\nWittgenstein once said \"if you can't talk about\nit, point to it.\" This is all very well, but it does\nmake SF Soc bulletins very difficult to write, or\nthink about for that matter.\nWhich leads us straight on to the news. We\nhave oodles of members. This is good. We\nneed as many as possible, so if you haven't joined, do (meetings lunchtime Southside Upper Lounge Fridays) either at a meeting or a film showing. To be quite blunt, we need\nmembers because ENTS are trying to stop\nanyone but themselves showing films by\nimposing severe financial restraints without\nany warning (this way no one could apply for a Union grant increase to compensate in time).\nThings are not as black as they may seem from\nthe foregoing though, so be of good cheer. I have no doubt that next terms choice of films\nwill be just as good (come to a meeting if you\nwish to influence that choice, or indeed borrow\na book from our library (no lending time limit\nunless someone really wants to read what\nyou've borrowed)).\nCity & Guilds\nOK here goes. Most important event this week\nr is the Election U GM for Vice-President and\nPublicity Officer.

Tickets available from\nGuilds Union Office or from Departmental\nReps.\nNext Friday will be a Halloween Party( probably joint C CU) in the JC R.On Sunday\nBo makes his annual pilgrimage to Brighton\nand, as usual, coach loads of Guildspeople will\ngo down to cheer him home and have a good\ntime.\nFurther details in Guildsheet.\nThe Geology Freshers' Dinner is on tonight.\nEveryone should meet in the Union Ba r between 6:00 and 6:30pm.

The highest individual collect er was Dave Molesworth of Mining2 who collected \u00a336.04. Well done!\nTo all those who came out on Tiddlywinks\nthanks very much. We collected \u00a3630 and\njudging by the number who came back to the\noffice afterwards, everybody enjoyed themselves.\nTomorrow sees the second stunt, the\nChristmas stunt, so let's see all you win kers out in festive spirit, 10:30amR CSU Office,\nasking people to give us the money they won't have in December.\nPapers are now up for ordinary members of\nthe Ents Committee so if you are interested in\narranging entertainments for the rest of us\nplease put your name up.\nTickets are still available for the remaining\ndinners, so hurry to buy, and remember that a ticket for any dinner entitles you to entry to\nboth the Physics and Life Sciences parties.\nAnd finally, tickets for the RCS October\nraffle are on sale from reps and officers next\nweek, top prize \u00a310, with other smaller prizes,\nfor only 10 pence per ticket.\nFELIX, October 16, 1981 Page 7\n\n"
