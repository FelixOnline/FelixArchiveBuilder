    "content": "All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties preview\nfemm 10\nFriday 8th December 2006\nIt is sold out and it is far away from London but the independent\nmusic festival, All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\u2019 Nightmare Before Christmas\nis happening this weekend. If you are lucky enough to be going then\nhere are the artists that will be playing, if you are not going then here is\nsomething to make you feel bad\nA\nll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties is the name of a\nbrilliantly melancholic song by The Velvet\nUnderground and\nalso a Gibson novel;\nit is also the name of\na music festival that\nhas been going for 7 years.\nFounded by Barry Hogan in 1999, it was\ncreated as an alternative to the large corporate faced festivals around at the time\nsuch as Reading. The setting was also in\nentirely different approach, it was to be\nbased at a holiday camp in Camber Sands\n(now in Minehead, Somerset for this\nweekend). This provided a very intimate\nsetting for bands who wouldn\u2019t necessarily be playing the main stage at V Festival.\nAnother simple premise of All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties (or ATP) is that they generally have musicians (or occasionally visual\nartists) to curate the festival. This means\nthat they invite their favourite bands and\nperformers to come along and play at the\nfestival. This idea was best described by\nThurston Moore (who is curating this\nweekend\u2019s Nightmare Before Christmas),\nwhen he said, \u201cIt\u2019s [ATP] the ultimate\nmixtape.\u201d\nSo, for those who can\u2019t stand being disgustingly muddy in a field surrounded by\ndrunken idiots and being numbed by stadium rock, then ATP seems ideal. Previous bands/artists to curate the festival are\nMogwai, Tortoise, Shellac, The Mars Volta\nand Autechre. This might give you some\nidea of the music you could expect to hear;\nif you\u2019ve never heard of the above bands,\nthen you may not have heard of a lot of\nthe bands playing, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nthey\u2019re rubbish. Simpsons creator Matt\nGroening also curated in the US version\nof ATP\n, so the festival does throw interesting line-ups. It is the personal approach\nwhich endears the festival to so many; it\nhas more of a community than your average mainstream festival.\nAnyway, onto this weekend, where a\nplethora of psychadelic, noise, punk and\nnoisy-punk bands are playing. As I men-tioned, Thurston Moore (guitarist and\nvocals of Sonic Youth) is curating and he\nThe delightful chalets of old residence of ATP\n, Camber Sands in East Sussex\nruns his own label called Ecstatic Peace, so\na lot of the bands due to play at the festival\nare on this label. Other bands playing are\nperformers that Thurston just loves, so if\nyou know what Sonic Youth sounds like, you\nmight know what to expect.\nIt might not surprise many to hear that\nIggy and The Stooges are headlining, since\nthey are one of the main influences on Sonic\nYouth. Iggy et al may be getting on in years\nbut they still can tear it up like back in the\nday, so expect all the classics from Raw\nPower played loudly and also, statesman-like; their power has not yet diminished.\nObviously Sonic Youth will be playing, and\nso will The Melvins (pictured below), who\nhave been around almost as long as Sonic\nYouth and inspired Nirvana (they both came\nout of the Washington scene in the 80s). It\ncould be described as grunge but it is a dull\nand cumbersome definition when it is a lot\nmore. The Melvins have a new album out\n(came out in October) called (A) Senile Animal, this may be a reflection on their age but\nI\u2019ve had a listen to it and it doth rock muchly;\nlook for a track called Blood Witch from the\nnew album, I love it.\nAnother band that have been around for\nover 15 years are Bardo Pond, an American\npsychedelic group with female vocals (and\noccasionally flute). But don\u2019t let the tag,\npsychedelia put you off, if it does, the guitars\nare edgy and the sound is large like early My\nBloody Valentine. Their tracks are on the\nlong side but their expansive sound needs it\nso they can get inside your head, have a fiddle around and exit through your earhole.\nIf psychedelia isn\u2019t edgy enough for you\nthen hardcore pioneers Negative Approach\nwho reunited this year. They along with Minor Threat (Fugazi\u2019s predecessor band)\nhelped define hardcore in the 80s, and\ntheir experience will win you over easily.\nThis is just a small taster of what to ex-pect, acid-drenched folk can be found in\nthe form of Six Organs of Admittance and\ninstant garage-punk tunes are presented\nby Be Your Own Pet (on Ecstatic Peace\nrecords). If you like psychedelic solos then\ngo for Comets on Fire or if you want classic post-punk then go for Gang of Four.\nClockwise from top-left: Be Your Own Pet, Sonic Youth (Thurston Moore is curating ATP), Comets on Fire psyching it up, The Melvins and Iggy and the Stooges in action\n\n"

ICU had a\nprevious agreement with ULU to\nallow teams to continue competing\nin the league competitions, but this\ndid not cover the knockout cups.\nThe motion was passed by a wafer-thin majority of just one vote.\nKings argued that ULU leagues\nare open to non-affiliated institu-tions, such as the University of the\nArts (UoA), whereas cups are not\nand that once Imperial left UL they\nwould no longer to be eligible to\ncompete. In our favour, Mr Collins\nargued that ICU has been a member of ULU for over 40 years and it\nwas inappropriate to compare us\nto UoA; he added that it would set\na bad precedent that could lead to\nthe destruction of the competitions\nconcerned if more colleges chose\nto leave UL. He also pointed out the\nfinancial benefits for ULU of allowing ICU sports teams to compete,\nas the Union will be paying an entry\nfee. Senior Union figures believe\nthat it is worth paying for the privilege of allowing sports teams to\ncontinue to compete in leagues and\ncups as ULU. ULU leagues have\nproved extremely popular and have\ngenerally been well run by ULU\nmanagement. ICU has no plans to\ncontinue to purchase any more of\nthe services that ULU would offer.\nThe motion would have fallen if\nit wasn\u2019t for the late appearance\nof Deputy President (Education &\nWelfare)Ben\u201cFluffy\u201dHarris,whose\nvote secured the majority. Mr Collin\u2019s motion was also staunchly supported by the large LSE delegation\nand without their support the motion would not have passed. Some\nULU sabbaticals who were initially\nopposed to allowing us to continue\nentering the cups were eventually won round by Mr Collins\u2019 arguments and voted for the motion. No\ndoubt they found the financial argument from ICU particularly appealing given the parlous state of ULU\nfinances.\nThis motion should have been far\nless arduous if our whole delegation\nhad turned up. The Union\u2019s ULU\ndelegates,LinMeiandFurquanKid-wai, have received a formal warning from the President for failing to\ngive notice of their non-attendance,\nwhich almost resulted in Imperial\nteams being denied the opportunity\nto compete in cups. This would no\ndoubt have been met with anger by\nsports clubs who enjoy competing\nin the knockout tournaments.\nA cup, not of the ULU variety, but a cup nonetheless. Oh yes, it\u2019s definitely a cup of some kind. Hmm\nICU teams keep the right to compete in ULU\u2019s sports leagues\nAston rejects NUS\nin new referendum\nThe NUS lost a member institution\nlast night, as Aston University Students\u2019 Guild announced the results\nof its referendum on disaffiliation.\n550 (53%) voted to disaffiliate, with\na turnout of just over 1,032 (about\n15%). Aston is consistently rated in\nthe top 20 universities for teaching,\nbut is outside the top research-fo-cused institutions. It is a small uni-versity, with around 7,000 students.\nThe Executive Committee (EC) of\nAston Guild believed that they were\nnot getting value for money from\nthe NUS and that their students\u2019\nbest interests would be served by\nchoosing to disaffiliate. EC member Jarrad Glover told Felix: \u201cWe\nbelieved that the NUS just didn\u2019t\nrepresent value for money for Aston Guild. The NUS has achieved\nlittle of late, and we didn\u2019t think that\nwhat they were giving us was worth\nthe tens of thousands of pounds we\npaid them annually.\u201d\nIn addition to the substantial affiliation fee, the overwhelming\nstrength of feeling against the politics of the NUS was also a key factor for students who voted to leave.\nIt was also evident that the introduction of the NUS Extra discount\ncard at Aston stirred up a lot of antipathy towards the NUS as several\nstudents objected to paying \u00a310 for\na card that was previously free, on\nthe grounds that it amounted to the\nmarketisation of student discounts\nby one organisation.\nThe referendum at Aston did not\npass without incident. A petition\nwas submitted to Aston Guild before the results were announced\nquestioning whether the NUS tactic of sending dozens of their campaigners on campus each day made\nthe referendum result invalid.\nUnion elections have rules regarding media access and spending\nto ensure that no candidate has an\nunfair advantage. Mr Glover com-mented: \u201cThere were only two Aston students who were prepared to\ncommit time to campaign to stay in\nthe NUS. We told the NUS to stay\naway as it should have been a matter for Aston students to decide, but\nthey came anyway. It is undemocratic that they are allowed to overwhelm campuses during referenda\nin this way. The margin of our victory should have been greater.\u201d\nNUS campaigners present included Wes Streeting, VP Education and leader of the Labour Students faction. It has been reported\nto Felix that he cancelled an entire\nday of meetings to assist campaigners at Aston. This news was met\nwith incredulity by the leader of the\nNo campaign at Imperial and City\n& Guilds College Union President,\nJames Fok: \u201cWe respect that the\nstudents of Imperial voted narrowly\nto join the NUS but we are committed to ensure that the NUS delivers\nfor us. ICU are paying them \u00a352,000\na year and they shouldn\u2019t be using\nit to pay for the salaries of staff to\nstand and hand out leaflets. Mr\nStreeting will only benefit Imperial\nstudents if he is representing us\nat the highest level, like he promised us during our referendum, not\nwasting his time and our money at\nAston.\u201d\nStephen Brown\nAston University - now with an independent students\u2019 union\n2 felix Friday 8 December 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nGet it out and and wave it all about.

    "content": "femm 8\nFriday 8th December 2006\nIndependent Thought\nThe independent music media is broadly described as\nthe music media that is self-contained \u2013 and tends to\nbe of smaller scale \u2013 and not belonging to mainstream\nthought and large media companies, either in print\nor on the internet, Matty Hoban looks into the\nalternatives to the mainstream music press\nT\nhis may seem obvious\nbut just as music needs\nindependent labels;\nit also needs an independent music media.\nThe spirit of independence comes from often\nbeing opinionated and\noutspoken about music and promoting\nbands that are making music that may\nnot get recognised by the mainstream. I\nthink it is fair to say that those who care\nabout music will work that little bit harder\nto discover more and the independent music media can be a great tool for that. The\npeople who tend to work within the independent media tend to be just as enthusiastic about music as those willing to seek\nout alternatives.\nIt may surprise many that the NME belongs to IPC media which is a large publishing firm which also puts out Loaded\nincidentally. I say it may surprise because\nthe NME\u2019s focus tends to be on male guitar\nbands, that have been known to be called\n\u2018indie-rock\u2019, despite many of these bands\nbeing on major labels (as always, there\nare exceptions). With more mainstream\npublications, the communication of opinions and thought can be controlled and\nthere have been some examples of this influence in the NME, in certain album polls\nand various features. Being an independent publication means retaining independent thought and focussing on what makes\nmusic brilliant and communicating this is\nin an enthusiastic way.\nBefore you start accusing me of major\nlabel and publications bashing, I am not\nwriting to criticise but merely to inform. If\nmy opinions occasionally come through then\nthat is all they are: opinions. In fact, I invite\ncriticism from others; anything but apathy.\nSo, if you like your music but constantly\nwant to hear new things and experience new\nand interesting ideas then it is worth investing a bit of time and maybe a bit of money\n(if you\u2019re buying a magazine) in something\nthat may challenge your initial ideas of what\nthose same old chords and melodies can be.\nYou may also find it counter-productive for\nme to talk about other publications when I\ncould be talking about bands making new\nand exciting music. Well, there is a grain of\ntruth in that, but Femm is run off the volunteer writers\u2019 efforts and so we are limited\nin the amount of time and energy we have;\nit is far more worthwhile of you to go out\nand seek new pastures of ideas, which can\nbe presented in a better way than in these\npages. It is also good to know that there are\nalternatives and knowing what you are looking for considering most of the publications\ncan\u2019t afford advertising.\nSo what is there for you to find out? There\nare fanzines, e-zines, online communities,\npamphlets and more traditional looking\nmagazines. Now you know pretty much eve-rything, I can only elaborate. Fanzines (or\nzines) are what they sound like: magazines\nwritten by music fans and they\u2019re usually\nvery cheap as it is very easy to word-proc-ess a few articls and put some pictures in\nand photocopy the results. When punk came\nalong (thankfully), more fanzines were put\nout such as the famous Sniffin\u2019 Glue. Distributions of fanzines often just depend on\nthe dedication of the creators and in London\ncurrently there is a deficit of zines.\nOne journalist who started off writing for a\nfanzine called Communication Blur\n\u2013 a zine run by the Poptones and\nformerly Creation record label boss,\nAlan McGee \u2013 is Everett True (origi-nally known as Jerry Thackray). True has written\nfor the NME and Melody Maker (when it was\nstill around) and reported on the music emerging\nfrom\nWashington\nState,\nUSA in the late eighties and early nineties ie. the \u2018grunge\u2019 and early Riot Grrl\nscene; he has very recently released\na definite account of Nirvana called\nNirvana: The True Story. For those\nwho want more iconic background in-formation, Everett True pushed Kurt\nCobain in a wheelchair onto the stage\nat that Reading Festival perform-ance. I had the good fortune to have\na few words with Everett about the\nmusic press and various other independent media related things.\nIn more recent times, Everett was\neditor of Careless Talk Costs Lives, an\nindependent magazine that lasted 12 issues\n(on purpose) and was published between\nJanuary 2002 and November 2003. He [Ev-erett] is now editor-in-chief of Plan B magazine which is now released monthly; is a\ngood alternative (in my opinion) to the NME\nand Q if you ever grow tired of their bland\njournalism.\nSince Everett has been involved in many\npublications \u2013 both independent and mainstream \u2013 I inquired as to which publication\nhe is most proud of. He replied: \u201cProbably\nCareless Talk Cost Lives, simply because\nthat was the magazine we created out of\nnowhere; we had a specific plan and also,\npersonally, that was the one [Careless Talk\nCosts Lives] I wrote every single cover story for. We viewed it specifically as art and we\nknew it was going to exist a specific amount\nof time. We had a sense of creating history\nwith every issue.\u201d\nCareless Talk Costs Lives was intended\nas a replacement to what the creators saw\nas a decaying British music press. By limiting themselves to 12 issues of the magazine,\nthey created a sense of purpose. Also by\nrunning a magazine for a short amount of\ntime, does it reflect music as disposable and\nEverett exclaims that, \u201cMusic is disposable.\nThere is nothing wrong with seeing music\nas disposable. It is only the importance you\nchoose place on it as a listener.\u201d Whilst saying this I feel True pipe into punk ethic as a\nreaction to over-pretentious music.\nThis becomes evident when he says, \u201cIn\nthe late 60s/early 70s there was a pop-rock\ndivide when bands started thinking that\nwhat they were doing was really important,\nwith some kind of worth.\u201d He then goes on\nto mock the \u201cBeard-stroking men playing\n20-minute guitar solos because it was, \u2018Really important, man!\u2019\u201d Everett asserts that,\n\u201cI\u2019m not on the side of those people, I\u2019m on\nthe side of the disposable pop-kids, like Phil\nSpektor and early\nBeach Boys. I think\npop music is impor-tant, I still listen to\nthings I listened to\n30 years ago, but\nit should not make\nthem anymore im-portant. I think more\npeople should treat\nmusic as disposable then you might\nnot have people like\nBono or\nChris Martin around. If\npeople took them at\ntheir value they wouldn\u2019t\nhave a career, because as soon as\nyou have a career you take things for\ngranted and stop trying.\u201d\nThis vitriol is what Everett is partly renowned for; it seems a product of a music\nfan going into music journalism, starting\nfrom opinionated zines and being disillusioned by the music business. I was interested in what he thought of the mainstream British music press at the moment\n(as he worked both at the NME and Melody\nMaker) and he replied, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t really see the music press in Britain, I have\nno idea what that is.\u201d He expanded on this:\n\u201cI saw a news story in my local free paper,\nsaying that the NME had discovered wom-en, which is nice, but I do wonder if they\nrisk alienating their readership by writing\nabout women. Of course, you have the Observer Music Monthly which is for people\nwho listen to music once a month. I really\njust don\u2019t understand Q; if you hated music\nthat much why would you bother putting\ntogether a magazine?\u201d\nOn the subject of women in NME, he\nthinks that, \u201cOne suspects they [NME]\nthink females making music is a fad, which\nis weird, because personally I think males\nmaking music is a fad and I wish it would\nstop. I think Plan B next year is not going to\ncover any men making music at all.\u201d This\nattitude is easily noticed from a lot of Plan\nB covers; bands with female members\ndominate a lot of the covers eg. The Gossip, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Cat Power and The\nResearch recently. I chuckled at all of these\nunashamedly, but more matter-of-factly:\n\u201cIn terms of the role the music press plays\noverall. Well, everyone exists in their own\ntiny world; Plan B exists in its own world,\nso does NME. We [Plan B] happen to write\nabout more bands. Which is kind of weird\nas the NME comes out every week.\u201d Of the\n[NME] now, he gets the impression that,\n\u201cConor [McNicholas, NME editor-in-chief]\nis a fan of music, which is good.\u201d He does\nconcede however that, \u201cI don\u2019t actually pick\nup the NME, it\u2019s not aimed at me, I\u2019m not\n13-years-old and illiterate.\u201d Personally for\nEverett, the music he discovers is through\nword-of-mouth and for me, that is also true\n\n"

Even though I have my\nfinger on the pulse of the American punk\nscene, I have never bothered to give them\nThe Panic Channel\n(ONe)\n(Capitol)\nHHHHI\nalbum review\nAFI\nLove Like Winter\n(Polydor)\nHIIII\nsingle reviews\nSome albums and in fact many albums I\nlove are like fine art, a delicate montage of\nstrokes, made up of a foreground, subject,\nbackground and often naked artists' muses.\nThey layer emotion in thick oils, lead the\neye and subject you to vistas beyond belief.\nBut that isn't what (ONe), Panic Channel's\ndebut album is like. No, this is not a Constable, this is a Pollock - a canvas that the artist\nhas thrown everything in the studio at. This\nis not a child\u2019s painting - that beautiful innocence is the realm of Bjork \u2013 and it isn't\na crap painting either \u2013 hell I could splash\na bit of paint on a canvas. This is a Pollock,\na careful blend of chaos and colour, so dependent on personal opinion.\nModern rock has been defined by the\nlikes of Pearl Jam and when Jane's Addiction released Strays the move into the more\nconventional realm of hard rock lost some\nof their core fan base. Strays was a great\nalbum but the loss of Eric Avery meant the\nloss of funk. His replacement came in the\nform of Chris Chaney, a bassist who took\nhuge scoops of tone and tube distortion and\nsmothered it over Navarro's sweet licks. The\nalbum was still good and Perry's voice still\nworked so it was a shame to see the band\nsplit, again. Alas, all was not lost, the remnants of the Jane\u2019s Addiction; Steve Perkins,\nChris Chaney and Dave Navarro went on to\nform The Panic Channel with vocalist, Steve\nIssacs (of little previous fame). The result is\nthis Pollock of rock. It is balanced, well produced and a wonder to hear. There is no harmonic double flat isotropic scales here, it is\njust good old fashion riffs and power ballads,\nyet done well.\nTake Blue Bruises; coming in towards the\nend of the album this song is nothing too\nspecial, has been done before and is predict-able, but performed with relish and talent it\nsounds pretty darn good. Like Audioslave,\njust changing the singer of a group will never reinvent it. Said You'd Be and Outsider\nboth reminded me of tracks from Strays and\nRitual de lo Habitual \u2013 laid back melodies,\nlots of guitar delay interspersed with brief\nlicks and a milky bass line but it never gets\nas painful as Audioslave trying to perform\nRATM songs at Brixton Academy. On closer\ninspection there is depth to the lyrics. While\nSaid You'd Be takes a swipe at the possible\nfalse promises of Farrell for the brief reformation of JA, Outsider is Issac's realisation\nthat the band behind him is exactly that and\nsomething their long history will mean he is\nnever an integrated part of.\nFrom the Queens of the Stoneage-esque\nopener, Teahouse of the Spirits, to the closing Lie Next to Me it is easy to dismiss this\nalbum as generic and just a little bland and\non the surface it is \u2013 I mean a Pollock is just\nsplashed paint, right? Wrong! Under the surface there is complexity and order and that\u2019s\nwhat sets this long player apart from all the\nother American rock band releases.\nNick Simpson\na try. Perhaps I never bought their faux-Goth image, or maybe I didn\u2019t want to enjoy\nthe music of someone who voluntarily calls\nhimself Davey Havoc (I never bought stage\nnames either). Probably both. So here I\nam, trying to make amends for those times\nI may have been a little judgmental and\ncondescending.\nAs it turns out, I was right. AFI lack the\ngrit and guts of many of their peers. Love\nLike Winter is full of thin synth orchestra,\nslow hollow verses and only picks up pace\nin the chorus. The overall feel is of a band\ntrying to develop a more diverse sound. Of\ncourse, this isn\u2019t always a bad thing, but it\u2019s\ngenerally accepted that when punk musicians try to adapt musically it rarely works\n(i.e. Angels and Airwaves, +44, The Ataris).\nThe song is lyrically bland \u201cShe bit my lip,\nand drank my war, from years before\u201d, with\nDavey Havoc\u2019s weak whine adding nothing\nto them.\nI come away from this song feeling dis-appointed. AFI have a large fan base, who\nmust like them for a reason. Their earlier albums are meant to be very good, so why the\ndeparture from their hardcore roots? My\nguess is that these guys are growing up and\nhave had enough of playing music for under-21s. Is this inevitable? I don\u2019t know, but let\u2019s\nhope that other punk bands don\u2019t go down\nthe same road to mediocrity.\nFrancesco Padormo\nRed Hot Chili Peppers\nSnow ((Hey Oh))\n(Warner Music)\nHHIII\nThe Chilis, you\u2019ve got to love them, are the\nage of your parents but still churn out double albums and stadium tours like nobody's\nbusiness. Their latest release is from Stadium Arcadia, an album which follows their\nline of increasing commercialism. This is\nless of a criticism and more of an observa-tion; when any guy hits forty, he is going to\nhave a bit of a midlife crisis and get into easy\nlistening, which is essential what this is.\nGone is the genius of Scar Tissue or Otherside and the funk of original guitarist, Hillel\nSlovak, that has not resurfaced since it was\nlast seen in diluted form on Mother\u2019s Milk,\nthe first release after Hillel\u2019s death in 1987.\nTo the modern fan this is probably their\ndream Chili\u2019s single though. Catchy, warming and stereotypical of their recent work it\nis true chart-fodder, but beyond that it is just\nanother milestone in the decline of one of\nthe 90s greatest groups.\nNick Simpson\nThe Hours\nAli In The Jungle\n(A&M)\nHHHHI\nBands like The Hours are ten a penny these\ndays and apart from their art-rock roots displayed passionately by a Damien Hurst design for their EP cover there isn\u2019t much else\nto tell them apart from the crowd. Razorlight, Snow Patrol, The Zutons et al. wrote\nthe book and The Hours are just reading it,\nbut as Alan Bennett can prove, a fine reader\ncan make even a tired book interesting.\nAli in the Jungle can be summed up as\nguitar music and emotional men. Barebones drumming, a twee piano line and a\nsoundclip from the Rumble in the Jungle\ncommentator do nothing for breaking the\nstereotype. But just like hearing Johnny\nBorrell's backstage version of Golden Touch\nfrom Glastonbury I can\u2019t help but fall in love\nwith the sentiment which wraps this song in\na silver lining.\nIt is futile telling myself the album is going\nto be a mush of less thought-out and poorly-penned songs because the single is great\nand memorable \u2013 something popular music\nlacks in abundance. For that The Hours deserve credit but don\u2019t hold your breath for a\nspectacular follow up.\nNick Simpson\nWe now head off on a complete tangent\nto my last classic album, the indietastic\ndebut by Easyworld. Few bands keep you\nguessing like Liars (pictured above), and\ntheir most recent albums have kept then\non the murky side of obscurity (though I\nknow there\u2019s at least one other person at\nIC who is a fan, I Facebook stalked you).\nOn stage you will confront 7ft tall man\nbeast Angus who dated Karen O of Yeah\nYeah Yeah\u2019s fame and likes to wear night\ndresses and giant bear gloves. Their back\ncatalogue includes a concept album about\nwitches, a concept album about a drum\nwho journeys to Mt. Heart Attack, and\nsome very obscure and abstract EPs.\nThough I love Liars even when they\nwrite abstract songs called If you\u2019re a\nWizard then why do you need Glasses? I\ncan see how it wouldn\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s\nliking. However, their debut album They\nThrew us all in a Trench and Stuck a\nMonument on Top is indisputable genius.\nIt eerily predicted the whole New York\nPunk-Funk-New-Wave-whatever scene,\nand was indeed created in New York. I can\nhear the seeds of bands like !!!, The Rapture and LCD Soundsystem in songs like\nthe amazing Mr. You\u2019re on fire Mr., and the\nrest is full of sharp rhythmical guitar mu-sic, aped by people like Moving Units and\na gazillion others. There is a real decon-structive and abrasive feel to a lot of the\nalbum as well, certainly inspiring bands\nlike Whirlwind Heat.\nThey Threw us\u2026 begins with monotone\nsinging and various bits of household percussion in the form of the song Grown Men\nDon\u2019t Fall in the River Just Like That,\nbefore bursting into machine-gun sharp\ndrums and guitar, with a scene-starting\nfunky bass line and a rousing chant of Can\nyou hear us! It\u2019s gloriously messy and cha-otic. Garden was Crowded and Outside\nboasts my favourite typewriter solo (I actually know of three songs with typewriter\nsolos) and Nothing is Ever Lost or can be\nLost my Science Friend does something\nunholy to a drum with a delay effect. Liars\ncontinue messing with sound on We Live\nNE of Compton where the whole band\nseem to be somehow sucked backwards\ninto an aural point before the song bursts\ninto pure danceable punk-funk joy.\nMany people have been turned off Liars\nby their more recent and highly abstract\nalbums, to the extent that they forget how\nthe band started. They Threw us\u2026 sounds\nachingly cutting edge even now, five years\nafter its release. It has managed to influence (or at least pre-empt) not only many\nbands but also several scenes and is more\nexciting, more inventive and just plain\nbetter than any of them. You are missing\na vital piece of the musical jigsaw that was\nthe turn of the millennium if you do not\nown this album, a piece just as important\nas The Strokes\u2019 Is This It? And the last\ntrack on the album is 30 minutes long\u2026\n\u2019nuff said!\nJames Millen\nLiars\nThey Threw Us All In A Trench And Stuck\nA Monument On Top\n(Blast First)\nclassic album\n\n"

    "content": "reviews\nfemm\n3 Friday 8th December 2006\nreleases\nDeerhoof\nFriend Opportunity\n(Kill Rock Stars)\nLife is full of the obvious. Our day-to-day\nactivities are littered with obvious conver-sations, obvious jokes, obvious observa-tions, and we are constantly surrounded\nby obvious music. The tinny, stray rhythms\nescaping from many a commuter\u2019s white\nearphones entering our personal areas on\nthe tube; the omnipresent \u2018edgy\u2019 chart hit\nemanating from the nearby HMV or Virgin\nMegastore. Music has become so accessible\nand ingrained into our daily lives that each\nmedium and facet intermingles with an-other; advertisements and TV programmes\nhave led to many a successful track. Yet do a\nlot of us think about what we are listening to,\nor are we succumbing to the obvious nature\nof it: the typical verse-chorus-verse structure with that catchy chorus and forgettable\nverses. Do we want more?\nI find this is where people often divide.\nSome of my friends have never wanted more\napart from a huge, sing-along chorus and\nthrowaway, rhyming lyrics. I, on the other\nhand, always wanted more. This might make\nme a natural critic, but I just wanted more\nthan the obvious; I want to be challenged.\nOne thing that niggles though when I want\nthis is that I also don\u2019t want to be, well, bored.\nA lot of \u2018challenging\u2019 music is frankly boring.\nIt is just magical when a band comes along\nand strikes a balance between big melodies\nReigns\nStyne Vallis\n(Jonson Family Records)\nHHHHH\nCertain things remind me of England;\nnamely, British Rail tea, the shouting of feral\nkids, and warm ales. To this list, I can add\nthe Somerset duo Reigns and their second\nalbum, Styne Vallis.\nThisisnohalf-comfortingMorrissey-esque\nEngland of rainy afternoons in city centres\nand teenage disappointment. No, this is the\nEngland of tiny villages, of strange local\nlegends, of country life, and of the sinister\nhiding just below the mundane. I guess what\nI\u2019m trying to say, stripped of writer\u2019s preten-tion, is that this is the audio equivalent of the\ncult 70s horror, The Wicker Man.\nReigns\u2019 previous record was, on first lis-ten, a collection of reasonably pleasant\ninstrumental pieces constructed from pi-anos, violins, acoustic guitars, processed\nfeedback and field samples. Further listening revealed a much more complex record,\none that seemed squeezed free of any cruft,\nleaving only gorgeous melodies and a deep\nsense of that enjoyable, warm-blanket kind\nof melancholy. There was something there\nthat was much more than the combination\nof the parts.\nAs the previous record, They Lowered A\nMicrophone Into The Ground was, Styne\nVallis is a concept album in the best sense\nof the word \u2013 one where the narrative element only serves to enhance your pleasure\nat discovering how the songs fit into the\nwhole story being created. Styne Vallis is,\napparently, a town that was flooded in the\ndying days of the 1970s to make way for a\nreservoir. The water, however, turned putrid\nand could never be filtered, something to do\nwith the town\u2019s reputation for incest and vio-lence. The pair have created an utterly believable story (via their MySpace, and in the\naccompanying booklet) that you\u2019re never\nquite sure whether this record is meant as a\ndocumentary effort, or merely an elaborate,\nLovecraftian construction.\nTo the music, then. The opening track, The\nLost Black Mass Footage, shows this new,\nrefined Reigns. Voices sound as if they\u2019re\nbeing beamed from the bottom of the ocean,\nweird and twisted, repeating \u201cand then, the\ndead, shall die, again\u201d over snappy snare\ndrumming and motorik bass. Oh, and tons\nof bizarre field samples that sound like mutated crickets chirping. In short, awesome.\nThe whole thing comes across like a group\nof folk musicians that have just discovered\nMerzbow and Sigur Ros and are attempting\nto capture the former\u2019s disturbing noise and\nthe latter\u2019s, well, brilliance.\nWedding of Weed and Dead Weed is the\nother side of Reigns; the emotive, heart-string-tugging duo, using their vocoders to\nsing stories of love and inevitable loss. What\nstops this tale of young lovers growing old\nbecoming mawkish and awkward is the way\nthe words conjure up the mundane aspects\nof their lives. The supernatural element is\nstill there: the man dies before Styne Vallis\nis flooded, and the distorted narrator relates\nhow he still wanders the empty, weed-cov-ered streets underwater. I\u2019m a particularly\nstony-hearted bastard, and this still gets\nme.\nMy favourite by several hundred kilometres is the bombastic Volcanoes Of Taiwan.\nThe song opens with pretty guitars set\nagainst field samples of flowing water and,\nbest of all, uses the ticking of a grandfather\nclock as its backbeat. Before you\u2019ve had time\nto grow tired of the sheer prettiness of it all,\nReigns are pounding out optimistic piano\nchords over thunderous, stomping drums,\nas a faraway voice intones something along\nalbum review the lines of \u201cawaiting.. explosions\u201d. I can\u2019t\ntell, but that doesn\u2019t matter.\nExperimental pieces like Revised Map of\nthe British Isles, a song constructed from\ntypewriter noise and a lady\u2019s voice intoning\nthe names of places to be removed, added\nor modified to the map, impress greatly with\ntheir originality. The simpler pieces, like Divorcee, seem to have an aspect of traditional\nsong about them with their simple, memorable melodies and piano/acoustic guitar\norchestration.\nI really can\u2019t say any more, as it has become impossible to accurately describe\nReigns\u2019 sound. In a way, you can think of\nthem as \u201cpost-rock\u201d, but that would do them\nserious disservice. The range of instruments on offer is huge, and not all songs feel\nthe need to be slaved to a beat; in fact, some\nof the best tracks feature no percussion at\nall. The most important aspect of this record\nis the sheer Englishness of it; I grew up in\na small village in the north of England, and\nthe field samples and melodies here remind\nme of home, of days spent in the woods,\nand of the melodrama of small village life.\nPerhaps if you\u2019ve lived in cities all your life,\nthis record will seem like a charming set of\npretty little songs to you. To me, however,\nit\u2019s much more.\nAndy Sykes\nand challenging ideas.\nOkay, this is all well and good but what\nabout Deerhoof? Well, this band is, in the-ory, the best band on Earth: they have a\nfemale Japanese singer (Satomi Matsuzaki), constantly shifting structures and\nideas with a distinct pop-edge and they\nalso come from San Francisco, the hub\nof creativity. They have all the potential\nto master the divide between the obvious\nand the avant-garde. Yet there has always\nbeen something that has put me off them.\nTheir 2005 album, The Runners Four, was\ncritically lauded wherever it was listened\nto. I thought it was okay, not amazing, this\nwas due to Matsuzaki\u2019s vocals; they often deterred me throughout. The album\nwas apparently an intense experience\nto record and is equally intense to listen\nto. So in the end, the album was rather\ndisappointing.\nSince their 2005 effort, a lot has changed\nwith the band. They have toured with giants such as The Flaming Lips and Radiohead, and received admiration and confusion in equal measures from fans of both\nof these arch-groups. They also lost Chris\nCohen \u2013 to the band The Curtains \u2013 in the\nline-up and so are now refined to a three-piece. These changes may have added\nfocus to the band to produce the goods\nand be more defined in their song-writing.\nThis remains to be seen.\nThis is me rambling on anyway; you\u2019re\nprobably interested in what this album\nsounds like. Many have described them\nas anything from noise-rock to psych-pop,\nand I guess this is accurate, but I think\nthey are a pop-rock band trying to inject\nsomething interesting into this medium.\nThe melodies are catchy and addictive as\nwitnessed on opener, Perfect Me, which\nwill have you singing the following lines\nfalsetto: \u201cMe, me, me, me, meet the perfect me!\u201d It is addictive whilst the music is\nconstantly shifting from foot-on-the-moni-tor rock riffs to spluttering drumming \u2013 an\nimpressive feat considering how sparse\nGreg Saunier\u2019s drum-kit is \u2013 with organ\nstabs and jabs. I really think it is a brilliant song and raises the bar for the rest\nof the album. Does the rest of the album\ncompete?\nWell, yes and no, second track, +81 starts\noff with a brilliant trumpet intro and then\nhas a chorus including the phrase, \u2018beep\nbeep\u2019. This can only be a good thing! The\nverses tend to let it down though as they\nare a bit boring and just not Deerhoof. A\ndistinctly poppy- funk edge reminiscent of\nArchitecture in Helsinki comes through\non Believe ESP. The lyrics are incomprehensible but effective use of lala\u2019s save\nit. The rest of the album then disappears\ninto a bit of a blur between long keyboard\npassages and whispered Japanese vocals.\nThe final track, Look Away is 11 minutes\nand 45 seconds long and harks back at\ntheir more psychedelic edge but just has\nthe effect of not going anywhere. Losing\nCohen proves to be a mixed blessing.\nalbum preview\nDeerhoof looking jolly; probably because they make jolly music\nFOUR PAWS MEDIA\n\n"

Matty\nHoban looks into it\nfrom a music fan\u2019s\nperspective\nI\nhate house parties. There are rare\noccasions when I enjoy a good\nhouse party, ie. the times when\nthey have good music taste and\ngive me lots of free beer. It is a rarity when this happens though. So I\ntry to steer clear of these events\nand prefer to go to a gig. But when\nit is New Year\u2019s Eve, I do get invited round\nto a house party. Yeah, it was fun when we\nwere underage and your parents are out on\na Christmas cruise, but getting stoned and\nwatching Christina Aguilera videos isn\u2019t my\nidea of fun.\nWhat are the options open to you instead\nof a house party on New Year\u2019s Eve? Well,\nyou can always go out into London and end\nup at an overpriced club or you could go to\na gig that \u2013 now thanks to the new licensing\nlaws \u2013 runs over the midnight hour. There\nare a few options open to you and in the spirit of this month\u2019s theme of independence,\nthere are smaller gigs and an alternative\nto exploitative super-clubs.

A band that make music\nlike this is Charlottefield, from Brighton.\nThey are like Dischord hardcore punk, but\nhave a distinctly British post-punk edge.\nAlso playing are [pockets], a two-piece from\nLondon who make a good racket. Along with\nthis live musical feast, the Silver Rocket\nDJs provide a delicious combination of alternative rock from the early 90s, proper\nindie rock, post-punk and Girls Aloud (the\nultimate pop band). It is \u00a37 advance, but\ncheaper I imagine if you sign up on their\nmailing list (google Silver Rocket). This is a\nsteal considering your average New Year\u2019s\nEve club night will cost around \u00a330000 entry.\nBut then because I am going, I don\u2019t want a\nload of idiots turning up and spoiling my fun;\nif you\u2019re nice then come along.\nSpitz 10th Anniversary NYE Party\nBilly Childish, The Chatham Singers\nSpitz, East London\nAs mentioned in last month\u2019s Femm, Spitz\nis situated in East London. It has been\nhome to many a greater band and performer and now it is 10 years old, it wants\nto celebrate that with a garage-blues leg-end, Billy Childish. The theme of the night\nis called \u2018Not the same old blues crap\u2019\nand they didn\u2019t lie with the entertaining\nChatham Singers in tow, it will be a different way to celebrate the new year.\nMad Hatter\u2019s Tea Party\nAnd What Will Be Left Of Them?\nCamden Barfly\nIf Camden takes your fancy then pop along\nto this and watch a band knock together\nrock, indie and electro in one unholy mess.\nThings are always messy up here though,\nif you like that kind of thing.\nFrog New Year\u2019s Eve Party\nYoung Knives, Larrikin Love\nKentish Town Forum\nSince we\u2019ve interviewed one of the founders\nof Transgressive Records and introduced\nyou to Jeremy Warmsley, you may want to\nattend this Transgressive Records themed\nparty. Frog is usually found at The Mean\nFiddler on a Saturday and many of you will\nremember the nights queuing in the urine-stink of the alley round from The Mean Fiddler. Maybe you will be happy to know that\nFrog are hosting their New Year\u2019s Eve party\nat the Kentish Town Forum (just down the\nway from the Bull\nand Gate); a fantastic venue where\nI have seen many a\nbrilliant gig at.\nFor your aural\npleasure, there will\nbe Young Knives\nplaying, as well as\nLarrikin Love and\nRumble Strips. If\nyou are into your\nBritish indie-pop\nthen this should\nbe on your wish-list.

Mr Smith swore and\nbecame aggressive towards members of Council; these facts are on\nthe record. He refused to leave, and\nsecurity guards had to be called;\nthis too is on the record. Some accused Mr Smith\u2019s supporters of intimidating Union officers outside\nthe meeting, hence the use of the\nterm \u201calleged\u201d.\nI suggest you read up on what\nhappened: http://live.cgcu.\nnet/opinion/randomrant/1009.\nWhile I appreciate the rather\nelegant turn of phrase you use in\nyour last paragraph, I fail to see\nwhat point you\u2019re making. I\u2019m not\npolitically correct, and I\u2019d be more\noffended if you called me that.\nPolitical correctness is complete\nbullshit, and you can quote me on\nthat.\nDear Andy,\nReading the debate in the letters\npages surrounding the recent articles on Islam has been, at best, a\nrather depressing affair. I am surprised that, presumably intelligent,\nstudents of Imperial, such as Samuel Lynas (Letters, 1st Dec), could\nharbour such simplistic, biased and\ngenerally distasteful views on race,\nreligion and history.\nI would hate to think how unwelcome and uncomfortable, say, for\nexample, a visiting Muslim student,\ncoming to Imperial for a short time,\nmight be made to feel by reading\nsome of Samuel Lynas\u2019s ill advised\ncomments.\nI am of the belief that students\nshould feel welcome and wanted\nas members of our academic body\nno matter there religious or cultural background. Accordingly, we\nshould discourage attitudes and\nlegislation which may perpetuate\nthe marginalization of any ethic or\nreligious groups. When considering\nquestions of extremism in universi-ties, as it is popular to do these days,\nsurely the most effective strategy is\nto create an inclusive environment,\nwith in which, all students are able\nto feel at ease in there surround-ings. To marginalize or isolate\nthem, through bigoted commentary\nor poorly conceived policy, is surely\nto play into the hands of those who\nwish to instil extremist ideals. Despite being non-religious myself, I\nwould hate to work in an environment which restricted the religious\nexpression of others (so long as\nthey do not infringe on the freedom\nof anyone else).\nThat is not to say I do not believe\nin free, open debate. However, it\nmust proceed with judicious care\nand thought. In addition, an awareness of the social/political context\nwith in which it is being made is\ncrucial; to debate the Jewish faith\nis one thing, to do so in the throws\nof 1930\u2019s Nazi Germany is quite an-other, to give a rather extreme illustration of what I mean.\nFor instance, I would take issue\nwith Lynas\u2019s rather throw away\ncomment that \u201cPerhaps next week\nMr Raja could explain away the millennia of slaughter, enslavement,\nrape, pillage and genocide committed by Muslins...\u201d. Firstly, this\nseems to ignore the fact that as far\nas \u201cslaughter, enslavement, rape,\npillage and genocide\u201d go, our very\nown western, predominantly Christian, nations have a pretty stunning\ntrack record, what with Slavery, the\nInquisition, Vietnam, Iraq and the\nHolocaust to name but a few events\npeppering our past and present.\nHowever, this is besides the point,\nthe real issue is that it is unjustifiable to identify, in anyway, today\u2019s\nMuslim citizens, be they students\nat Imperial or not, to events which\nAndy Sykes replies,\nThis is actually one of the most\nreasoned replies we\u2019ve had on this\ntopic (in my opinion).\nThe parallel drawn with McCarthyism and \u201creds under the bed\u201d\nis an interesting one, and one that\nI think is fairly valid. It is true that\nthe US government has, since the\nattacks on Washington DC and\nNew York, used terrorists, and specifically Muslim extremist terror-ismts, as scapegoat figures. This\nclimate of fear has clearly spread\nto a good proportion of the western\nworld.\nThings are beginning to come\nto a head - the US electorate has\ndecided to reject Republican fear-mongering, and fill both houses\nwith Democrats. We, on the other\nhand, has experienced Islamic\nextremism on our own soil, something that seemed impossible three\nyears ago.\nWhat Mr Borsten says rings true,\nand I hope I see more balanced letters like this in future.\nSir,\nI write in response to Christopher\nThomas\u2019s opinion piece \u201cStudent\nPoliticians: hang them all now!\u201d\n(Felix 1365). Mr. Thomas calls for\ncheaper drinks in Union bars, something I strongly believe in myself.\nMr. Thomas also challenges me on\nthe fact that I made it a campaign\npoint and manifesto pledge that I\nwould \u201ccorrect the unacceptable\nincrease in bar and events prices\u201d\nand then goes on to accuse me of a\nbetrayal of trust because he had not\nseen any decrease in prices (the fact\nthat we had not seen any increases\nin prices since the start of my tenure seems to have slipped Mr. Thomas\u2019s mind...). I hope Mr. Thomas\nnow feels suitably happy with the\nchanges to the offers on Wednesday\nand Friday which have cut prices\n(see the Union page for details), I\ndid feel that there was some irony\nin the fact that I read this attack on\nthe same day as I was in meetings\nworking on these price cuts, meetings which have been going on for\nsome time and are still ongoing. I\ndon\u2019t expect that Mr. Thomas, or\nmany others I must admit, will now\nperform a volte-face and trust us all\nimplicitly, but I do hope that I can\nonce again walk past the nearest\nlamp-post without worrying about\nthe length of my neck.\nWe are working hard on the commercial services provided by the\nUnion to its members and there\nwill be further improvements in the\nnear future, these things do take\ntime. Yes, we could cut a whole load\nof prices tomorrow so why don\u2019t we?\nI, personally, would rather not cut\nprices one week only to have to put\nthem up again one or two weeks after that. The question people must\nask is do they want us to go for a\nhead-line grabbing, gimicky price-slash and then put prices up only a\nfew weeks after that, or would they\nrather we made a business plan\nand cut prices and then kept them\ndown. I know what I would like...\nRegards,\nJon Matthews\nDeputy President (Finance and\nServices)\nImperial College Union\nmay or may not have been a part of\ntheir cultural past. Should we prejudice German students in light of\ntheir Nazi past? No.\nAs for \u201csome unexplained media\nbias\u201d (Samuel Lynas, Letters, 1 st\nDec) against Muslims. Well there\ncertainly is a bias, as a cursory glace through the daily\u2019s would testify,\nbut unexplained? No, it is very well\nexplained. During tense and trying\npoints of history there is a precedent for the media, government\nand public to seek a scapegoat, both\nas an expression of frustration and\nas a justification of actions, particularly in the case of the government\n(see McCarthyism and Commies,\nfor just one example). It has been,\nin the past, the Jews, the commies,\nthe Irish, etc, etc, perhaps it is now\nthe turn of Muslims, what with\nthe mounting tensions in the middle east, the occupied territories in\nPalestine, the war in Iraq and the\non going conflict in Afghanistan\ncreating massive tensions around\nthe globe (all of which we the British have a hand in).\nLearning from our past is essential for the positive progress of hu-manity, but, it is not good enough to\nsay Hitler bad, Stalin bad, Saddam\nbad. We must understand the politi-cal, economic and social attitudes\nsurrounding the murkier parts of\nour history and how they played\na part in their development. This\nbrings me to my final point, comments of the form \u201cwake up to the\ndanger that Islam represents to\nthis country\u201d (Samuel Lynas, Letters, 1 st Dec) are a little too close\nto the likes of \u201cthe danger that Jews\nrepresent\u201d, so frequently used in\nNazi Germany, for my tastes. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong I am not for a second\nsuggesting that there is a direct\ncomparison, or that Lynas has anything even close to Nazi tendencies,\nonly that we must be vigilant to such\ntrends in the media if we are to take\nour lessons from the past.\nRegards,\nLeron Borsten\nLower bar prices?\nA Wednesday evening in da Vinci\u2019s - price cuts are in the works, according to Jon Matthews\u2019 letter\nSenator Joseph McCarthy, whose anti-Communist \u2018witchhunt\u2019 capitalised on the American public\u2019s fear\nof communism - are governments and the media now using Islam as their scapegoat?\n\n"

For\nexample, \u201cMaroon hair (6)\u201d would\nbe \u201cstrand\u201d, which is obvious in\nretrospect but none too easy at at\nthe time. These can become all but\nimpossible if the setter has used\nspurious synonyms or simply if one\nof the words or phrases is too obscure - for instance, \u201cOpen, for the\nlove of God! (5)\u201d is agape, which\nfairly obviously means open, but\nmore obliquely is also the word for\nman\u2019s love of God.\nParticularly helpful in such sita-tions is to be familiar with the setter - each will have their own particular foibles and quirks, and will\napproach an answer in very different ways, so it pays to know whether they take a tenuous approach in\nsuch situations or if they are more\npedantic, literal or even smartar-sed (all setters are smartarsed, by\nour very nature, though to different\ndegrees and with varying levels of\nwit).\nThis becomes very useful when\nfaced with a clue which looks to\nbe outside your vocabulary - if the\nsetter avoids words which are not\ngenerally in use you may be barking up the wrong tree, but if they\nthrowintheoccasionalobscureor\narchaic solution. In these cases,\nit can be a hindrance to eschew\na dictionary or thesaurus in the\nbelief that you are in some way\n\u2018cheating\u2019; reference works do\nnot provide the answers to clues\n- except in concise crosswords,\nwhere it defeats the point of the\npuzzle to do so, although some\nmight suggest there is no point to\nconcise crosswords anyway - and\nthere is no shame in not knowing\nthe existence of a word when the\nsetter will often not have known\nthewordthemselfuntiltheyfound\nthemselves faced with a particular gap in the grid. Regardless, it\nshould be easy enough to verify\nthe solution if the rest of the clue\nis set well. Occasionally, you may\nbe faced with a clue that does\nnot fit the two part construction\nof having both a synonym and a\ncryptic part of the clue. This can\neither mean that the setter has\ncome up with a particularly interesting sort of clue - perhaps of\nthe likes of \u201cGegs (9,4)\u201d meaning\n\u201cscrambled eggs\u201d or \u201cNur (3,2)\u201d\nas a Down clue giving \u201crun up\u201d\n- or that some or all of the clue\nhas multiple meanings within the\nclue itself. A wonderful example\nof this sort of clue appeared in the\nTimes a few weeks ago: \u201ca runner\non snow would (4)\u201d giving \u201cskid\u201d\nsince a ski is a runner on snow\nand the suffix \u201c-\u2019d\u201d is a contraction of would, and also someone\nrunning on snow would indeed\nskid. This highlights quite neatly\nthat even a rigorous clue with two\nways of solving need not have an\nactual synonym in the clue.\nSolving cryptics\nScarecrow\n33\nfelix\nFriday 8 December 2006\nPUZZLES sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Rationality vs overreaction\nT\nhe recent comments\nin this section have inspired much debate.\nOne thing to learn is\nthat judging a writer\u2019s\ntrue intention based on what he\nor she writes is always risky. Take\nSamuel Lynas\u2019 article for example.\nThe more na\u00efve readers among us\nmay have been fooled into thinking it was motivated by a concern\nfor morality and a desire to correct\nmisinterpretations. Fortunately, Mr.\nLynas settled the issue himself last\nweek with his bigoted reply in the\nLetters section, declaring that his\narticle was for the attention of non-Muslims waking up to the \u2018danger\nthat Islam represents to this country.\u2019 There can be no doubts about\nhis intention now.\nIronically, in the same issue, Pierluigi Frison wrote of the \u2018need to be\npeaceful and respect each other.\u2019\nPerhaps he was unaware that his\ncode of \u2018general morality\u2019 was being broken a few pages later by\nthe very person he was expressing\nagreement with. Or worse still, perhaps morals do not apply when the\nmost important religious figure of\nIslam is labelled \u2018mentally ill.\u2019\nNow let us consider the ISoc\u2019s\ndecision to post the original arti-cle. What the Society overlooked\nwas that history is always a sensitive issue and people take it per-sonally. Against that background,\nit is divisive to portray a conquest\nin a positive light, given that factual evidence may be inconclusive.\nFurthermore, it is an unfortunate\nreality that religions themselves\nare judged upon the conduct of\ntheir followers. Every sincere Muslim and open-minded non-Muslim\nAs Felix decides to draw a line under the ongoing debate, Basel Siddiqi provides his\ntake on the contents of these pages over the past three weeks\nknows Islam to be a peaceful reli-gion. Yet the likes of Lynas will continue to misinform others and their\nammunition will be the conduct\nand carelessness of Muslims. The\nISoc must be credited, though, for\nthe events they organise to educate\nstudents about Islam. Such events\nare conveniently ignored by those\nwho are poisoning themselves with\nconspiracy theories that Muslims\nsomehow want to force the West to\n\u2018adopt the dictates\u2019 of Islam.\nThe response to the article has\nproved equally distressing. Since\nLynas has discredited himself by\nthe admission of his motives, it\nis not worth discussing his opinion further. Then there is the issue of educated observers such as\nPierluigi Frison reaching drastic\nconclusions as seen in his closing\nparagraph last week. If Saad Raja\u2019s\ndefence of the ISoc article can be\ntaken as a demonstration that \u2018aggressive Muslims are everywhere,\u2019\nthen Samuel Lynas\u2019 comments indicate that fear-mongering Islamophobes are also ubiquitous. In that\ncase, one would be equally justified\nto say that it is Lynas\u2019 views, not\nthose of Raja, that constitute a \u2018perfect microcosm of the frictions\u2019 between the Muslims and the West.\nSaad Raja based his comment on\nstudies of Ottoman history by historians whom he mentioned by name.\nPierluigi Frison considers those\nsources biased and wades into the\nhistorical debate about what actually happened, obviously confident\nthat the sources he himself relies\nupon are totally unbiased of course.\nHe provides a whole list of lands\nconquered by the Ottomans and describes how parts of the population\nA\nt the risk of re-igniting\nthe same debate until\nwe are all blue in the\nface I initially hesitated\nto write this but the\ncomments made by Pierluigi Frison\ncannot go unchallenged. Firstly, note\nto self, an article in the \u2018comments\u2019\nsection of a paper is for the expression of personal opinion, not an open\nforum for propaganda.\nMr Frison\u2019s piece and that of Mr\nLynas were riddled with historical\ninaccuracies which would make any\nhistorian turn in their grave. Mr Frison however, does make a pertinent\nremark, he urges us \u201cto get informed\nby reading any version of the facts\nthat is neither bias [sic] from the\npoint of view of the conqueror nor\nthe conquered\u201d. I agree, but there is\nno such thing as unbiased historical\nfact. This does not mean however,\nthat we should all give up, just that\nwe should keep these limitations in\nmind. A fine example of where the\nold historical accounts are being\ncompletely overturned, is in the history of the Vikings. They have traditionally been taught as rampaging,\nbloodthirsty Nordic tribes, spreading\nnothing but carnage throughout Europe and dismantling the civilisation\nthattheRomansbuilt. Newevidence\nbased on recent archeological finds,\nand newly discovered manuscripts\nand diaries, are proving that the\nVikings were in fact a constructive\nforce, stimulating trade and cultural\ndevelopments throughout Europe.\nSimilar changes have been occuring\nin the history of the Ottomans (see\nrevisionist historians Nelson, Duby,\nSawyer and Coupland).\nSo what did Prophet Muhammad\n(Peace be upon him), really teach\nabout war? Before every battle he\nused to instruct his commanding\nchiefs and remind them of the ethics of war. These included not killing\nwounded soldiers and prisoners of\nwar. Residential areas were not to\nbe pillaged, plundered or destroyed,\nnor should they touch the property\nof anyone except those who were\nfighting against them. In particular,\nreligious and sacred buildings of all\nfaiths, were to be protected. Muslims were forbidden from taking\nanything from the general public of\nthe conquered country without paying for it. They were even forbidden\nfromuprootingtreesandplants.Now\nlet us compare this with the continuous killings of innocent civilians, and\nthe destruction of entire cities, all\njustified by \u2018liberal\u2019 and \u2018progressive\u2019\nwestern states as being unavoidable\n\u2018collateral damage\u2019.\nFrison\u2019s flamboyant remarks that\nMuslims at this fine institute of excellence do not believe in general\nmorality or maybe even encourage\nterrorism is, well, an opinion. In this\nscience and evidence based institute\nwe leave no stone unturned, let this\nnot be an exception. Let us not allow\nour emotions or preformed stereotypes cloud our intellect. Judge for\nyourself, do the research, visit the\n\u2018immoral\u2019 Islamic society events and\nif you\u2019re feeling exceptionally bold\none day have a conversation with\nan \u2018immoral\u2019 Muslim, you could be\npleasantly surprised.\nAs for Lynas\u2019 letter to the editor?\nNo comment.\nA response to Pierluigi Frison (1366)\nwere allegedly \u2018enslaved, raped and\nmurdered.\u2019 That is, if we choose to\nbelieve the \u2018unbiased\u2019 sources Frison has managed to unearth, above\nthose that Raja referred to. One\ncan see the stalemate and neverending argument developing here,\nwhich Frison exacerbates by comically resorting to the \u2018chicken or\negg\u2019 game; stressing that Muslim\narmies conquered the Middle East\nfrom Christians before the crusaders attempted the opposite.\nFrison would predictably argue\nthat his aim was to criticise those\nwho defend conquests of the past.\nBut the simple claim that armies\nare often brutal to civilians post-conquest would have been enough\nto do this, since \u2018it should be clear\nto EVERYBODY\u2019 anyway. Instead\nhe uses emotive language, as Lynas\ndid, in what seems to be an attempt\nto gain the moral high ground. This\nattempt becomes obvious when he\nbegins praising European countries and \u2018especially Britain\u2019 for\ncondemning imperialism and the\n\u2018leeching\u2019 of raw materials and\nestablishment of puppet regimes.\nPerhaps Frison has already forgotten about the illegal invasion of Iraq\nbut I am sure the irony of his praise\nwould not be lost on most readers.\nUpon finding the ISoc article ob-jectionable, the sensible approach\nwould have been to ask rational\nquestions about its validity. Instead,\nthe response has been bigoted\n(Lynas) and exaggerated (Frison).\nThis is not befitting of a tolerant\nsociety and we must rise above the\nblame game and realise it is not the\nduty of just one community to be\n\u2018careful and teach respect.\u2019 That responsibility lies with everyone.\nBasel Siddiqi T\nhere\u2019s a saying in\ntelevision that you\nshouldn\u2019t work with\nchildren and animals.\nIn my opinion an\nequally important adage is that,\nwhen in England, you should never plan any outdoor event more\nthan 24 hours ahead of time. Doing so guarantees that you will\nend up sitting on the beach in a\nthunder storm or running a marathon in a heat wave. So, having\narranged Orient House\u2019s Christmas trip to Rochester Dickensian\nFestival, I shouldn\u2019t have been\nsurprised two days before we\nwere due to go to hear the weather warning for gale force winds\nand forecast for heavy rain! The\nday dawned and the rain and\nwinds were in evidence as we all\nboarded the bus. I hoped that this\ntrip wouldn\u2019t be remembered as\nthe one where several students\ndeveloped hypothermia. By some\nmiracle, however, by the end of\nthe hour and a bit long coach\njourney, we arrived in a cold but\ngloriously sunny Rochester.\nThe city was complete with traditional fair, Christmas market,\nstreet theatre, a whole array of\nDickens\u2019 characters wandering\nthrough the crowds and even a\nbrass band playing Christmas\nsongs whilst snow fell (thanks to\nthe marvellous fake snow machine that was in situ). Rochester\nis where Charles Dickens spent\na large number of his childhood\nyears and many of his books are\nbased in the area. Hence the city\nhosts this event every year to celebrate their claim and the narrow\nhigh street was crammed full of\npeople enjoying the chaos.\nHaving enjoyed the fantastic\nperformers, looked around the\ncastle, museum and cathedral\nthat Rochester boasts and spent\nour pennies displaying our\nthrowing skills (or lack of them)\non the coconut shy, we all got\nback on the bus, thawed out and\nheaded to a local hotel for dinner.\nThree courses, crackers and\na bit of shaking our funky stuff\nlater, it was time to head back to\nLondon.\nHalls\nwatch\n\u201cThis is not\nbefitting of a\ntolerant society\nand we must rise\nabove the blame\ngame and realise\nit is not the\nduty of just one\ncommunity to be\ncareful and teach\nrespect\u201d\nRayan Aldouri\n\u201cThe narrow\nhigh street was\ncrammed full of\npeople enjoying\nthe chaos\u201d\nVerity Leeson\nOrient House\n6 felix Friday 8 December 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

But at the end of\nthe day, it boils down to no-one\nreally caring about \u201cthe image\u201d. Rock music went through\nfar worse periods of unpopularity than being a target on the\nDaily Mail\u2019s slow news day.\nI think it also underlines\nthe fact that we can be a bit\nhypocritical sometimes too.\nAs much as we bemoan the\nbusiness policies of Electronic\nArts, no-one ever has the conviction to really boycott them\nen masse. Is it because they\u2019ve\nused money to create a powerful monopoly over the market?\nOr is it simply that we\u2019d rather\nplay games than get bogged\ndown in protests and politics?\nA bit of both? Maybe.\nBut maybe it\u2019s just that gamers don\u2019t know what they want\nany more. There was a time\nwhen we didn\u2019t need to know \u2013\ngames were games, and you either played them or you didn\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s a large contributor to a\ngame\u2019s status as \u201cclassic\u201d \u2013 not\njust good design, but a lack of\nany real alternative.\nSo now that the Wii has finally made its way to these shores\n(pulling off the most impressive\nworldwide release out of all the\nnext-gen consoles) are we really sure we want it after all?\nThe Wiimote isn\u2019t going to be\nan extension of your arm, and\nthe virtual console isn\u2019t going\nto be a cheap one-way ticket to\nretro heaven. Have we really\nthought abut what next-gen\nmeans, or are we letting Nintendo play the gimmick card\none time too many?\nIt seems unlikely that the\nWii will beat the marketing\nmachines of Sony and Microsoft, whatever happens, but\nboth sides of Felix\u2019s argument\nthis week note the same thing\n\u2013 innovation, gimmicky or not,\nis required to keep the game\nalive. So whether you think\nwe\u2019re being played for fools,\nor whether Nintendo is finally\ngoing to take a risk that pays\noff, one thing seems certain\n\u2013 change means that someone\nis thinking, for better or worse.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t deserve being given another chance four\nyears from now, then nor does\nFIFA.\nWii\u2019ll be back in January.\nFresh out of good puns though.\nMichael Cook\nGames Editor\n26 felix Friday 8 December 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYou can\u2019t handle the truth!\nT\nhere\u2019s something very\nstrange about people.\nIndividually they all\nknow, deep down, that\nGrim Fandango was\na fantastic game, that Radiohead\nis whiny shite, and that Jude Law\nis as attractive as rotting sewage\nin a man thong. But get enough of\nthem together, and by god you can\nbe sure they\u2019ll be lapping up the OK\nComputer Special Edition, and buying the Scratch n\u2019 Sniff Jude calendars by the bucketload.\nAnd it\u2019s not that they\u2019re buying\nrubbish that\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s\nthe disturbing, twisted pleasure\nthey seem to get from purchasing\nsomething that they know is utterly\nterrible. A question for you holier-than-thou readers sitting on the\nprosecution bench \u2013 if I gave you\nthe chance to make a ridiculous\nsum of money out of this simple fact\nabout shoppers, do you really think\nyou\u2019d turn it down?\nWorse than this though \u2013 if you\nweren\u2019t even gamers, if you were\nbusinessmen first and foremost?\nWhat then? Would you feel any\nguilt? Because there\u2019s a lot wrong\nin Electronic Arts\u2019 past, but the\nmost common criticism \u2013 that they\ntend to churn out the same rubbish\nover and over just to make money\n\u2013 isn\u2019t much of a criticism when you\nstop looking at them as a games\npublisher with a Markey share\nand PR issues, and start looking at\nthem as something much simpler\n\u2013 a stock market value, and a six-month performance graph.\nFine, you can\u2019t absolve every businessman of responsibility to the\nmarkets, but let\u2019s make that point\nagain before we go any further, just\nso everyone is clear on it \u2013 The Sims\nhas sold, to date, more than sixteen\nmillion copies. You don\u2019t need to\nknow how good or bad a game is to\nwork out that an expansion pack is\na good business move.\nSo if you really want to get EA\nbehind bars with an empty bank\nbalance, you\u2019ll need to get deeper\nwithin the problem. Why do people hate EA? Because they think\nthey\u2019re ruining \u201cthe Industry\u201d.\nIt\u2019s true that EA do themselves\nno favours in the press department.\nWhen they make the news it either\ninvolves the phrase \u201chostile takeover\u201d or \u201cemployee conditions\u201d, and\nthey have acquired a large number\nof development houses in the past,\nit\u2019s true. At a recent presentation to\nImperial\u2019s computing department,\nRajan Tande, a lead programmer at\nElectronic Arts, said \u201cI think they\nprobably do deserve a lot of [the\nbad press]. But it\u2019s also out of proportion.\u201d In many cases, Electronic\nArts has saved development houses\nfrom collapse, and brought together\nmore effective groups of designers\n\u2013 long working hours are a fact of\nlife for any games programmer. But\nhey, it\u2019s easy to kick a multinational\nmedia corporation when it\u2019s down.\nA quite prominent example is\ntheir purchasing and liquidation of\nWestwood Studios. Many key figures left the studio after EA took\nthe group from Virgin in the nineties \u2013 but those that stayed went on\nto create an award-winning sequel\nto Red Alert, and then went on to\nform EA Los Angeles with Dreamworks \u2013 a team that now has a\ntrack record including much of the\nMedal of Honor series, The Battle\nFor Middle Earth and Command\nand Conquer 3. Did they break the\nmagic of a well-oiled development\nstudio, or did they find a new way to\nBigger kids make you hate them. Michael Cook in search of (E)A Few Good Men\nExhibits A-C : Maxis, Will Wright, and The Sims franchise\nIn the late eighties, Will Wright got\ntogether with Jeff Braun and published a game called SimCity. It\nwas a huge hit, spawning a 1993 sequel and securing both Wright and\nthe Sim brand as defining moments\nin gaming history to date.\nHowever, the franchise began to\ndecline in the mid-nineties. Games\nsuch as SimCopter, though ambitious in some ways, failed to meet\nwell with the market, and the company began to run into trouble.\nIn 1997, Electronic Arts\ncomplete the acquisition\nof the Maxis brand, allowing them to\ngive direction\nand funding to\na development\nhouse that\nthey knew had poten-tial. Will Wright wasn\u2019t\nmoved around, the company wasn\u2019t liquidated, and until\nthe release of The Sims 2: Pets, the\nMaxis brand remained in all of\ntheir games.\nElectronic Arts didn\u2019t\njust see potential in\nMaxis itself - they\nsaw potential in\nthe structure of\nMaxis, in the people working in it.\nWill Wright is considered as one of the leading lights\nin game design today, and The\nSims has changed the face of both\nuse the talent, giving a chance to a\nteam that wanted to stay isometric\nwith Red Alert 2, even though the\npressure was on to move to 3D?\nAnd if you think Electronic Arts\nhave got worse since then, then\nfast-forward to 2002 when a long\nprocess of lawsuits began between\nSierra (later Vivendi Universal)\nand Valve Software began, beginning over a simple argument about\nlicense selling, and ending up with\nVivendi attempting to wrench control of the Half-Life intellectual\nproperty from Valve. Evil corporations attempting to take control of\nfranchises from developers? This\nsounds familiar. But Electronic\nArts stepped into the ensuing chaos\nand signed a deal to publish Valve\ngames on the high-street for the\nnext few years. No asset-stripping.\nNo design breaking. Just a mutual\nco-operation that both companies\nbenefited from without either taking any financial hit.\nWhy did Electronic Arts agree to\nstep in and publish the games? For\nthe money? The high-street version\nwasn\u2019t in huge demand, and helping\nout Valve \u2013 a company that has now\nused Steam to rival EA as a games\ndistributor \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem like\nfantastic business sense from the\ncompany whose stock value rose by\n300% in the first year of floatation.\nAnd yet, at the same time, it just\ndoesn\u2019t feel all that likely that they\nwere just really big fans of Gordon\nFreeman. Maybe EA saw what was\ngood for the market, for the indus-try, and decided to do it?\nOr would that be too human a\nmove for you all to handle? The defence rests.\nWould Half-Life 2 have been released if Valve had lost to Vivendi and EA hadn\u2019t stepped in to publish?\ncasual gaming and simulation gaming forever. Could this have gone\non without Electronic Arts\u2019s power\nand funding? It doesn\u2019t seem very\nlikely.\nAnd while many gamers would\nrather not have The Sims on shop\nshelves, far more are looking forward to Wright\u2019s 2007 release,\nSpore. Great ideas only go so far\n\u2013 Electronic Arts has the power to\nprop up and support what they see\nas good gaming.\n\n"

    "content": "feature\nthe\nscene\nfemm\n7 Friday 8th December 2006\nS\ntarting out with an ambitious plan\ncreating a label that was \u201cethically\nsound and that would release the\nbest records in the world\u201d, Transgressive has progressed beyond\nwhat most people would expect. Currently\nresponsible for putting out a seemingly endless list of great artists including The Young\nKnives, Ladyfuzz, Rumble Strips, Mystery\nJets and Regina Spektor, they seem to be\ngoing from strength-to-strength with every release. With the recent signing of The\nShins, Foals and Jeremy Warmsley we\u2019re\nsure to see some great things from this independent London-based record label in the\nfuture. With an emphasis on allowing bands\nto create their own sounds without label in-terference, they are an ideal match to artists who don\u2019t want to end up sounding like\nevery other commercialised band. A proper\nindie label.\nTransgressive records have come a pretty long way since you started out, has it\nTransgressive behaviour\nClockwise from top-left: Foals, The Shins, Ladyfuzz and The Pipettes\nturned out anything like\nyou expected it would\nback then?\nWe were always ambitious to create an impor-tant,iconic,andtrustwor-thy music source - purely\nbecause we want to help\nrepresent artists the way\nwe feel they\u2019re supposed\nto be portrayed. So many\nquality acts become disillusioned in the music-industry - we try to fulfil\nour acts\u2019 desires accu-ratelyandenthusiastical-ly, whilst also providing\ngreat quality packaging/\nartwork, treats for those\nthat buy the music... It\u2019s\neasy to be stagnant and\ndo things on auto-pilot,\nbut being involved with\nmusic/releasing artists\nis a gift and a wonderful\nopportunity - why be\nmediocre?\nTo now be in a position\nwhere we can compete in the charts with\noriginal, vital new music, that\u2019s subversive\nand challenging, yet infectious, as well as\nstill release music on a very limited, collectible scale... It puts us in a unique and\nfascinating position. We\u2019ve released over 50\nrecords in two years, and we\u2019ve poured our\nheart and souls into ensuring every single\nrelease is as strong as possible.\nI assume you get plenty of demo discs sent\nin to your office regularly, what sort of factors would you be looking for in a demo\nbefore you decided to sign the artist (apart\nfrom them sounding good obviously...)\nTo be honest, don\u2019t over-hype yourself; good\nmusic talks, not a self-penned press-release\nor fancy sellotape to seal the Jiffy Bag. al-though, that said, it\u2019s nice to occasionally\nreceive \u2018bribary\u2019 - such as miniature bottles\nof alcohol or chocolate. Although these tend\nto serve as distractions from the bands that\ndo this elaborate/pricey procedure (perhaps\nthat\u2019s the motive!).\nBut, jesting aside, be honest about what\nyou\u2019re wanting to achieve, why Transgressive is THE label for you (if you feel it is!),\nand that\u2019s it.\nWe sadly don\u2019t accept many artists via\ndemo submissions as we get sent a volume\nwhich is insane. Best bet for new bands is\nto gig locally, build a following, gets lots of\nfriends on your myspace, send us a link,\nand we\u2019ll try our best to listen... Apologies\nthat we\u2019re a bit crap sometimes - we don\u2019t\nspend huge amounts of time seeking out\nlots and lots of new things, as we have a lot\nof projects on at the moment... Maybe it\u2019ll\nchange in a few months!\nUp and coming and super popular London\ntype bands seem to dominate your cata-logue, are you looking to keep this format,\nor are there any plans to conquer the world\nwith any big future releases?\nThis is a bit of a misconception we suffer\nwith at the label; we\u2019re not THAT Londonthe bands we have are from as varied places\nas New York (Regina Spektor), Austria (La-dyfuzz), Brighton (The Pipettes) and New\nMexico (The Shins), even the ones from\n\u2018London\u2019 are from the real suburbs.\nWe\u2019re just into music being good - where\nit\u2019s from is irrelevant... There\u2019s no map on\nour walls stating, \u2018Next - JAPAN!\u2019. It\u2019s whatever\u2019s unique and special. I\u2019m from High\nWycombe (urgh), and Tim who I co-run the\nlabel with, is from Essex.\nI know you got into the music industry at\na young age, but how did you actually get\nstarted with Transgressive Records?\nTim + me + meet at a gig = chat in a pub =\nTRANSGRESSIVE! We felt like we\u2019d known\neach other for years, before we had... It was\na real meeting of tastes and insights... And\nseveral years experience of blagging on\nguestlists for our music-writing (Tim used\nto write \u2018Roadkill\u2019, a great fanzine; I used to\nedit, but still overlook rockfeedback.com).\nThe label naturally progressed...\nAny advice for budding young record label\nexecutives out there?\nOnly release music you know innately is important and vital, or you\u2019ll flounder. There\u2019s\nno such thing as an easy shilling, and people will smell a fake. Just work with artists\nthat you know HAVE to be making music,\nand whose motives are pure and undying towards their cause. Greatness is universal.\nYou seem to be branching out into other\naspects of the music industry, broadcast-ing, managing etc, any future plans to expand on these?\nIt grows all the time! Doing a TV show was\na natural one, too - \u2018music TV is lame...\nlet\u2019s do our own\u2019! And now \u2018rockfeedback\ntv\u2019 is on not just MTV2, but Channel 4, too.\nIt\u2019s very humbling. Club-nights are great\nfun - whether our monthlies at Buffalo Bar,\nunder \u2018the basement club\u2019 moniker, every\n4th Thursday of the month, or the Transgressive Roadshows... It\u2019s so exciting to\nhave that direct connection with music in\nthe live capacity. Management is equally\nrewarding - Johnny Flynn, who we\u2019ve just\nstarted working with, is a genius. We also\npublish The Noisettes, too - a former one-off singles act... They\u2019re touring with Muse\nin Europe as I type; blimey...\nBeing an indie record label, how do you\ndeal with the actual business side of\nthings (artistic control etc) do you have\nany sort of model for this?\nThe model is the artist comes first, and\nwe\u2019re slaves to their cause (or therea-bouts). However, we will step in and give\nadvice/prodding when\nwe feel it is necessary\n- just trying to motivate/\nencourage, and make\nsure whatever magic it\nis they\u2019ve unearthed for\nthemselves, that it stays\nintact and that we might\nbe able to help preserve/\nenhance it!\nAnything we should\nkeep an eye out for in\nthe near future from you\nguys?\n2007 is going to be stellar.\nThis is why:\nFOALS. Our amazing\nnew signing. The best\ndance-rock band for\nyears, so intelligent, so\nvisceral, and shockingly\nstunning live.\nMECHANICAL BRIDE.\nShe\u2019s awe-inspiring, and\nso talented for years so\nyoung.\nTHE SHINS. Third album in, and we\u2019re\nlucky to be putting out this incredible\nrecord.\nJEREMY WARMSLEY. His 2nd LP is due\nin 2007 - he\u2019s a genius, and a father to the\nemerging folk scene. A true star.\nBATTLE. At long last... the astonishing\ndebut LP\n. It was worth the wait.\nFinally, where do you see yourself in 10\nyears time? Still working in the music in-dustry, TV or both?\nGoodness knows; it\u2019s day by day, the only\nmasterplan is to keep rep-ing amazing\nmusical talent, and trying to do things the\nway we feel they should be done. We\u2019re\nprobably deluded beyond belief, but - so\nfar - it\u2019s feeling good.\nNow meet Toby L, co-founder of Transgressive\nRecords, the independent label that signed Jeremy\nWarmsley, Gregory Mead had a word with him\nOther independent labels\nThe Beggars Group is the largest independent label in the UK, it consists of\n4AD, XL recordings and Beggars Banquet. They possibly will be putting out\nfuture releases of Blood Red Shoes.\nRough Trade are consistently good and\nhave been going for ages. Matador has\nput out Pavement and Interpol amongst\nother goodies and Southern are excellent for your more avant garde music.\n\n"

On\nMonday, 27th November it held yet\nanother fascinating talk on the concept of \u201cSlum Networking\u201d under a\nglobal issue of \u201chabitat\u201d.\nThe guest speaker, Priti Parikh,\nis a chartered civil engineer who\nis currently undertaking a Ph.D. in\nSustainable Development at Cambridge University.\n\u201cSlum Networking\u201d is a concept\ndevised by Himanshu Parikh (Priti\u2019s father), which approaches the\nproblem of slums by looking at them\nin the context of the city as opposed\nto an isolated unit.\nSlums in India usually consist of\na system of poorly built shelters,\nsome made of brick, others out of\ncorrugated steel and tarpaulin.\nWithin these areas, sewage and water supply can often be found in the\nsame location, exposing the slum\ncommunities to diseases.\nWomen and girls are required to\nspend a large proportion of their day\ndisposing of household and sanitary\nwaste and collecting clean water instead of preparing the children for\nschool or attending lessons.\nA possible solution to these issues\nwas devised in the form of slum networking which looks to improve life\nin slums without direct intervention from NGOs, governments, and\nother organisations. To use a clich\u00e9,\nit is a method of helping slum dwellers help themselves.\nThe first method of implementing\nslum networking is by manoeuvring\nthe natural drainage paths of the\ncity to run alongside the slums. This\ngoes a long way towards improving\nthe slum environment whilst dramatically reducing costs compared\nto conventional \u201cslum solutions\u201d,\nsuch as public stand posts for fresh\nwater distribution and community\nlatrines.\nTo complement and increase the\nefficiency of the natural drainage\nsystem, topography management\ncan also be applied to the city. This\nDevelopment through slum networking\ninvolves the engineering of roads\nto slope continuously downwards\nso that they reach their natural water level with minimal intervention.\nThese roads can also be contoured\nto act as channels for storm drain-age. These slum networking techniques substantially reduce the\ncosts of alternative drainage methods and also lower maintenance\ncosts.\nOne of the many positive impacts\nof slum networking is that where\nslum dwellers have the means,\nthere have been huge spurts of\ninvestment to improve their slum\nhousing. Research has shown that\nthe three main stimuli for invest-ment, in descending order, are\nphysical services, social status, and\ntenure security.\nEmploying this psychology, governments can tap into the latent\npotential of the slum-dwellers\nto help them increase their own\nresources.\nIn addition to this, the standard\nof living has improved, a fact underlined by health-related statistics\nsuch as a decrease in the infant\nmortality rate, a reduced number\nof working days lost due to illness,\nand a large reduction in medical\nexpenditure.\nThe next hurdle that development workers such as Priti and her\nfather face is gaining the backing\nfrom governments to implement\nthe methods of slum networking in\npoor, densely populated areas.\nIf you\u2019re interested in Slum Networking or would like to come\nalong and be a part of this amazing student movement, visit the\nEngineers Without Borders web-site: www.ewb-uk.org or contact\nthe Imperial Branch at imperial@\newb-uk.org\nFishing nets \u2013 \u00a310.00\nOxfam Unwrapped\nThis gift will help poor communities\nwork together to fish their way out\nof poverty \u2013 providing nets, boats,\nequipment, and training.\n200 ft distribution pipe \u2013 \u00a318.00\nAlternative Gift Catalogue\nHelp provide safe water for families in the hills of Myanmar,\nwhere clean water sources are scarce.

    "content": "T\nhepre-orderswerefilled\nweeks ago, and now wii\nfinally have a chance to\nplay Nintendo\u2019s latest\nstep in the console tree.\nWith inferior technology, but several innovative twists, Nintendo once\nagain are staking their success on\nlateral thinking, and by standing in\na very different corner to Microsoft\nand Sony.\nFinally, people are talking Nintendo again. In the past, way in the\npast, they were gaming. There was\nnothing else worth talking about.\nBut as new technologies game in\nthey were pushed out by a greedy\npursuit of shinier surfaces.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 Nintendo\nmade a lot of cock-ups, and in some\ncases their stubborn desire to oppose certain changes has just shot\nthem in the foot. They snubbed the\nCD, they snubbed the DVD (and\nstill are) and they pooh-poohed\nthe internet. But one thing never\nchanged \u2013 they always played.\nNintendo lovers are a special kind\nof fanboy. It\u2019s groupieism that\u2019s\ngone bad, eaten too much sugar,\nand then watched an entire season\nof South Park in a day. But read anything written by Nintendo guru designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and in an\ninstant you can understand where\nthat love springs from.\nThey loved the SNES, the N64,\nthe Gamecube. They loved every-thing, whether it was good or not,\nand that worldwide dedication\nis what let Nintendo take a new\nchance each time around. They\u2019ve\nnever stopped pushing the ideas\nthey had, no matter how much they\nwere ridiculed.\nSo the question that everyone\nseems to be asking, as they do every time Ninty make a new stride, is\n\u201cis it the Big One?\u201d \u2013 is it going to\nfall into Great Gaming Mistakes of\nHistory, or will this take us into the\nrealms of playing that we couldn\u2019t\neven conceive of previously? And\neven though we always ask it, out\nof a kind of courtesy, this time they\nreally seem to have struck a chord\nwith the public. They can boast\nabout a $200 mn marketing budget\nfor the Wii, but the truth is this: this\nconsole has marketed itself.\nYou don\u2019t get that a lot. The 360\npissed cash all over the American\nmedia, until you couldn\u2019t switch\non a TV without seeing a grinning\nbald guy. Sony \u2013 well \u2026 Sony are\njust Sony, and in a respectful, ma-fia-like way, if Sony bring out a piece\nof electronics, then you feature it if\nyou can. But Nintendo really only\nhold sway with people who are already gamers. The Mainstream\ndon\u2019t need to mention them unless\nthey\u2019re talking about the eighties.\nA long, long road to Revolution\nWhat makes Nintendo\u2019s products so timeless? Tony Plana checks the odds on Nintendo\u2019s latest gamble\nA\nnd this is why the Wii\nfascinates me. I\u2019m kind\nof interesting in playing Tennis with the\nWiimote, I guess. And I\nlike Nintendo as much as the next\ngamer. But the Wii has got people\ngaming almost without them realising it. And that\u2019s going to prove\ninvaluable in years to come, both\nfor industry profits and for gamers,\ntoo \u2013 a richer demographic means a\nmore varied release schedule.\nThere is some concern, though,\nbecause in Nintendo\u2019s quest to\ntake over the non-gamer they may\nfind \u2026 not much else. Should you\nget a Wii? Yes, probably. Zelda is\nas swords-and-shields-y as you\u2019ve\ncome to expect, and Super Mario\nGalaxy will be a brilliant use of the\ncontroller, no doubt. But don\u2019t be\nfooled \u2013 this technology isn\u2019t per-fect. And ultimately, if Nintendo\nwant to woo non-gamers, they\u2019re\ngoing to need a different kind of\ngame than we\u2019re used to. Sure, Super Smash Bros. Dojo is going to be\nas frantic as you\u2019d expect. But the\nother console contenders probably\naren\u2019t too worried.\nWhy? It\u2019s not because they\u2019re just\ngoing to throw cash at the problem\nuntil it goes away. Well, not entirely,\nanyway. It\u2019s mainly because they\nknow that the Wii won\u2019t satisfy you.\nAnd that\u2019s the bottom line. You\u2019d\nhave to have a very good argument\nto deny that Nintendo\u2019s offerings\nare some of the finest first-party\nsoftware ever devised. But despite this, there\u2019s never enough\nsubstance. Smash Bros. will be a\ngreat party game, and Zelda will,\nof course, be gripping single-player.\nBut there\u2019s nothing as weighty as\nHalo 3, nothing as deep as Final\nFantasy, nothing as epic as World\nof Warcraft. Nintendo can easily get\na Wii in every home, but it won\u2019t be\nalone for very long.\nAnd so that\u2019s the question you\nneed to mull over if you weren\u2019t fortunate enough to get a pre-order in\nfor December 8th. If you decide to\nget a Wii in the new year, you\u2019ll be\nhard pushed to regret the purchase.\nBut you\u2019re also going to wind up\nwanting a Playstation 3 or an Xbox\n360 before the end of the year.\nIn amidst all the bitching and\nname-calling of the run-up to next-gen, Microsoft\u2019s Peter Moore told\nReuters, \u201cPeople are going to buy\ntwo [machines] \u2026 they\u2019re going to\nbuy an Xbox \u2026 and a Wii. For the\nprice of a PS3.\u201d That wasn\u2019t idle\nsmack talk. Whether the Wii really\nwoos the public will be seen, but\ngamers may need to get \u201cthe good\nstuff\u201d from more than one dealer\n\u2013 and Sony and Microsoft know it.\nZelda: Twilight Princess is one of the most anticipated games for the Wii\u2019s launch window. No-one does first-party gaming like Nintendo\nNintendo\u2019s entire philosophy has been that of fun, and this came up again and again in the press releases and build-up to the release of the Wii. It\u2019s hard not to be drawn in\n28 felix Friday 8 December 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "F\nor years, people have been\nsaying that games aren\u2019t\nas good as they used to\nbe, and for years they\nhave been wrong. The\nmost common complaint is a lack\nof innovation \u2013 that modern games\nrely too much on swanky graphics\nand neglect innovative or engaging\ngameplay, while in retrospect it is\nconsiderably harder to spot the older games that were sold on grounds\nof their shiny graphics since, after\na couple of years, they all begin to\nlook equally unimpressive.\nBut these blinkered retrophiles\nseem to ignore the vast swathes of\ninnovative games that have come\nalong over the years as well as the\nformulaic pap of yesteryear, though\nin many ways the latter is for the\nbest. But all the same \u2013 how can\none deny how original games such\nas Worms, Black & White, Pikmin,\nRadiant Silvergun, Rez, Grim\nFandango, even the likes of Super\nMario Sunshine and countless others have been?\nThe clich\u00e9d complaint in these\ncircumstances is of \u201cselective amnesia\u201d, but this is exactly the sort\nof thing that goes on; new games in\nthe Metal Gear / Metal Gear Solid\nfranchise are criticised as being\nindicative of the insistence on constant sequels to a successful idea\ninstead of being praised for constantly pushing the envelope and innovating more and more with each\niteration; retro obsessives rejoice\nin criticising the slew of drab first-person shooters of recent years\nwhilst ignoring similar occurences\nsuch as the slew of derivative platformers of the late-eighties / early\nnineties.\nOf course not every FPS is going to be a patch on Half-Life, or\neven Wolfenstein 3D, but many\nretro games aren\u2019t worthy to be\nmentioned in the same sentence as\nElite, Pac-Man, or dear old Pong.\nSo I shan\u2019t.\nSo does the Wii, released this wiik,\nherald a possible end to this back-ward-thinking grumbling? Certainly, it\u2019s the most revolutionary console to be released, at least since the\ndeath of the cartridge, possibly ever\n(though mention must be made of\nthe Virtual Boy, also from Nintendo,\nwhich was innovative without being\nin any way consequential).\nWhilst other leading manufacturers fill their consoles with faster\nand faster processors and more advanced graphics chips and simultaneously add features to turn their\nconsoles into fully-fledged home\nentertainment systems, Nintendo\nhave focused on what should be the\nmost important thing when creating a console \u2013 fun.\nT\nhe very idea of the con-sole, from its bizarre\ncontroller to its childish\nname and even its stand\nfor holding it up at a\njaunty angle, not content with formulaic notions such as \u201clying flat\u201d\nor \u201cpropped on its side\u201d, is very\ncarefully calculated to bring across\nHands on: Why Wii will rock you\nA wiivolution? Hugh Stickley-Mansfield\u2019s been there and done that, and it\u2019s all in the wrist apparently\nthe notion of fun, either through\npsychology or by providing it out-right. Certainly, wireless controllers\nare nothing new, nor even infra-red\nones, but never have they come as\nstandard with a console instead\nof seperately for use only with the\nlikes of Duck Hunt or Turbo Bass\nFishing Deluxe 3.\nThat the very hardware that\ncomes as standard is neccessarily\nimmersive cannot fail to make the\ngames manufacturers conscious\nof the potential of these devices for\nnon-standard gameplay, in a way\nthat hasn\u2019t been provided by addons to previous consoles such as\nthe Eye-Toy.\nThe notion that anyone could\nfail to have more fun swinging the\ncontroller about as though it were\na sword as opposed to repeatedly\npressing buttons to hack and slash\nis utterly laughable, though this\nview seems to be held by many seri-ousgamers(anepithetwhichshows\ntheir position up as ridiculous - the\npoint of games is quite deliberately\nnot to be serious), though that\u2019s\nnot to say they won\u2019t themselves\nbe won over by a control method\nwhich immerses them physically\ninto the game through more than\na rumble function in the controller.\nIt is this immersiveness that is key\nto the charm of the Wii; whilst more\ntraditional control methods draw\nplayers out of the game by forcing\nthem to translate what they wish to\ndo in the game into a combination\nof buttons and joystick movements,\nan intuitive system of essentially\nacting out one\u2019s role pulls one further in.\nSadly, I doubt anyone who already\nfeels the same way as I do will read\nthis, what with it being published\non the wiilease date, and those\nwho have pre-ordered one will be\ntoo busy battling their way through\nZelda to bother with anything so\nmundane as a newspaper. But they\nalready know I\u2019m right.\nThe Wiimote in the elegant lady gamer\u2019s right hand is where most of the action goes on, but the Nunchuk in her left is a key add-on\nMachinima producer? Clan gamer? Internet addict? 1337? Or a writer? Felix Games is planning 2007 and\nwe want gamers at Imperial to get in touch.

    "content": "M\nerry Christmas\nall! Although\nwe\u2019re not quite\nthere yet, this will\nbe my last nightlife page, since Greg gets out of\nrehab in time for the first issue\nof next term. Maybe I will dust off\nmy pen in the new year and write\nsome reviews for a change, but\notherwise this might be the last\nyou ever hear of me.\nI may be saying goodbye, but on\nFriday night I welcomed And Did\nWe Mention Our Disco? back to a\nregular spot in London for their\nnow monthly parties. Despite a\nslightly disappointing venue (a\nrather dingy part of London Metropolitan University student un-ion, tucked away near Aldgate),\nthey are still doing their best to\nattract some very fine DJs and\nthey certainly need no help attracting a large crowd of people to\nhear them play. Good music and a\ngood atmosphere made for an entertaining clubnight, if not quite as\ngood as back in the good old days\nat Plastic People.\nThat\u2019s enough of that pseudo-review anyway. All that remains\nis for me to wish you all a delightful holiday, whether or not your\nentertainment occurs during the\nnight time.\nAlex Baldwin\nNightlife Editor\nFollow the bubbles to... King\u2019s Cross\nStood, quite cold (freezing my arse\noff, more accurately), on Pentonville Road, I turn to my associate,\nwho has led us out of this particular exit of King\u2019s Cross. We\u2019re in a\nrush, the place starts charging in a\nmere twenty minutes, and we can\nill afford to head in the wrong direc-tion. He contemplates the situation,\nperuses a choice few signs, and\nfinally points to the right. Before I\ncan decide whether to listen to him,\nI look to the left, and swear I can\nsee snow falling. I gape wide-eyed\nat the spectacle from above, because that\u2019s definitely not snow. My\nhand lingers weakly as I point to the\nmachine attached to the forth floor\nof the building next to us, spreading\nbubbles over the entire street, and\nurgently shake his shoulder. The invites said: \u201cFollow the bubbles\u201d.\nButtoned Down Disco has come\na long way since I last visited prop-erly, this time last year, when it\nwas hosted at The Purple Turtle,\nin Camden. For a start, Scala is a\nsignificantly larger venue, and sec-ondly, there were a lot more people.\nThere were three main rooms, with\ninnumerable corridors and sub-rooms, which at first can be bewil-dering. When you first enter, the\nmain bar lies in front of you, and\nto the right is a ponderously large\nstaircase that leads right the way\nup to the top of the venue.\nThe main bar is the first room,\nwith the formidably large cloakroom queue, and a small, seemingly pointless, dance floor in its own\nroom on the side. I say pointless,\nit wasn\u2019t until a few hours/drinks\nlater that I discovered what a simply joyful little place it is. Firstly, the\nroom has fantastic acoustics, and\nperhaps more importantly, two opposing walls are each flanked with\na line of square lights, that flash in\ndifferent, hypnotising colours (think\nClose Encounters of The Third\nKind). Disappointingly, this little\njoyhole was also terribly sparse\nthroughout the night, which I find\ndesperately ironic considering that\nthe music was also the most obviously danceable, being a variety of\nglitchy electropop (played by the\nlovely Speakerboxx DJs), which the\nkids who visit Trash and Our Disco\nenjoy so much these days.\nCorridors run from each of the\nother rooms that lead onto the main\nroom, a converted cinema, with a\nlarge stage and the usual array of\nbalconies dotted around the place.\nThe main room has Dollyrocker,\nthe resident Buttoned Down Disco\nSo it\u2019s finally (nearly) Christmas,\nand since this is the last issue of\nterm, we\u2019re going to assume that\nthe holidays have already started,\nunless you are actually reading this\nissue of Felix on the last day of term\nin which case it will be true that the\nholidays have started, but it\u2019s fairly\nunlikely that there will be any copies of Felix left around campus by\nthat time, considering last week I\nsaw a bunch of rugby/football/pub-lic-school types destroying about 50\ncopies of our beloved paper in Beit\nQuad after an all night lager downing session in the Union Bar. If the\nculprits are reading this, I\u2019ll have\nyou know that each copy of Felix\nnow costs \u00a358 to print since we\u2019ve\njoined the NUS (as opposed to 20p\nbefore) I have no evidence supporting this fact, but it\u2019s probably true.\nAnyway, the point of this article is\nto act as a guide to the festive season around this lovely town otherwise known as London. Of course,\nas usual - we\u2019ve got a wonderful\ncompetition prize for you people\nto win in this issue, so you could\nalways consider checking that out,\nbut unfortunately Felix does not yet\nexert enough influence to give away\nprizes of tickets for every single\nevent in the capital, so we\u2019re going\nto give you a few ideas as to where\nsome of your beloved Nightlife team\nwill be visiting this holiday.\nFirst of all, let\u2019s start with Christmas parties, since that comes first\nchronologically. Last years Trash\nmailing list party was great, which\ncan only mean one thing: This year\nwill be even better. It\u2019s a mailing\nlist member only event, so if you\nwant to go \u2013 make sure you sign up\non the website. Decent music, the\nsmell of hairspray, fashionistas ga-lore, a late licence open until 6am\nand free punch for everyone, what\nmore could you want? Admission\nwas free last year, and it most likely\nwill be this year too. Check their\nwebsite for a host of other Christmas events they\u2019ve got organised.\nAnother great bet is the Afterskool Christmas party on the 18th December. It\u2019s a great night out, loads\nof people are dressed up and they\ngive away presents to everyone!\nLast year I was given two amazing battery powered candles, two\nplastic aeroplanes, 3 bouncy balls\n(which smell really nice), a big box\nof chocolates, 12 mince pies and\na miniature green rugby ball! Of\ncourse, the drinks are super cheap,\nand the music is great too, which is\nalso a bonus. Definitely the friendliest Christmas party I\u2019ve ever been\nto. The Panic! Christmas party is\nalways worth a try too, so you could\ncheck that out if you can\u2019t make any\nof the other dates I\u2019ve mentioned.\nNew Years Eve is next, and assuming you haven\u2019t decided to study\non this wonderful excuse to go out\nand get completely hammered and\nwake up having spent your entire\nstudent loan and overdraft, then\nyou\u2019ll want to be going to some super badass ultra cool mega-party.\nIf you like hard dance then we suggest Heat NYE at the Brixton Academy (see our competition a bit further down the page to win tickets).\nAt 4000 capacity is should be pretty\nawesome, and you\u2019ll be sure that\nwhen you leave the club at noon the\nnext day with happy memories, giant pupils, wobbly legs and 4 new\nbest mates you won\u2019t regret going\nDJ, playing a mix of popular electro and danceable alternative rock,\nPixies, Le Tigre, Strokes, Soulwax\nand everything else you would expect from Buttoned Down Disco,\nreally.\nI mentioned a staircase off to the\nright, I think. It leads off right to\nthe top of the venue, where there is\nanother room, big enough to stand\non its own as a club. Playing in here\nwere the impressively named Pirate Soundsystem, although one\nquestions the glorification of piracy;\nif you ask me, raping and pillaging\nis not something to be proud about,\nbut there\u2019s no telling some people).\nTheir music was a bit more on the\nhip hop and funky side of things, al-though, if memory recalls correctly,\nstill quite electronic at times.\nNear to this was my favourite\nroom \u2013 the chillout room. Just above\nthe main room, with magic sound\nreducing glass, comfortable leather\nchairs, and these odd stepped floor\nthings on the side that you can sit\nup on (a while after sitting on one\nof the embedded lights, it was quite\nsurprising to look down and notice\nthat light was shining out of my\narse). I must admit that this is the\nkind of place a lot of clubs could do\nwith, somewhere where the volume\nis just right, you can converse to\npeople freely, yet the music from\nbelow is still distinctly audible.\nAnyway, here\u2019s the clincher, do\nI really honestly approve? Well,\nfrankly, I have had an awful lot of\nfun both times I\u2019ve visited, and the\ncrowd is an unusually friendly one,\nand they do have great choice in\nvenues. However, it is very difficult\nto distinguish the clubnight from\nthe club itself in this case, because\nof the nature of Buttoned Down\nDisco \u2013 it\u2019s a secret nightclub, so it\nchanges venue sporadically around\nLondon (by the way, you sign up\nfor invites at buttoneddowndisco.\ncom). So that means it is really\nquite a game of pot luck, because\nit changes every different club that\nthey hire. I have to say, Scala was\nimpressive though, and there\u2019s no\nshortage of regulars, plus the music is sublime.\nThere\u2019s something for everyone\nat their large events, as this event\nshowed \u2013 there was live MCing\nat this event in the upper room,\nso alongside the traditional electronica and indie selection there\nwas also a hiphop flavour, which\nis astoundingly unusual in my ex-perience, as let\u2019s be honest, the\ncrowds don\u2019t mix particularly often!\nConsidering their nights are free,\nit\u2019s hard to disapprove, although I\nwarn somewhat about the sporadic\nnature of the place \u2013 each night is\ndifferent than the last!\nMatt \u2018The Hat\u2019 Long\nfor one second. Of course, if that\u2019s\nnot your thing then there are plenty\nof other events going.\nThis year, Afterskool team up\nwith White Heat to deliver what can\nonly be an amazing New Years Eve\nparty. As they put it you\u2019ll be having a spectacularly sexy 6 1/2 hour\njoyride, starting at 9.30pm, tearing\ninto the year 2007 at midnight, then\nbursting out onto the streets at 4am\nwith more sweets, balloons, glow\nsticks and party poppers en route\nthan is legal. Well I\u2019m sold. Another\ngood bet is Fabric New Years Eve,\nthe wonderful French duo Justice\nwill be DJing room two, along with\nCraig Richards and Terry Francis\nheadlining the main room.\nAs is the case with most New\nYears Eve parties, they will all be\nextremely popular, so if you\u2019ve really got your heart set on going some-where, we suggest you buy your\ntickets far in advance, or you\u2019ll end\nup spending your evening standing\nin the street queuing up for entry\nto some hell-hole like Walkabout,\nor paying three times more to get\nin where you actually want to go.\nAlso, expect to spend money, lots of\nmoney.\nSo, that\u2019s the end of this pointless guide, and if you\u2019ve read this\nfar then I congratulate you on having so little else to do, but hopefully\nit\u2019ll have given you a few ideas as\nto what you might do, or at least\nprompt you to organise something\nof your own.

    "content": "femm\nfemm\nFriday 8th December\nMatty Hoban Music Editor-inChief Jenny Gibson & Thomas\nWhitson Public Relations Music\nEditors\nreviews editorial\nA\nnother month, another Felix Music Monthly then. This\nweek, I decided to introduce a\ntheme of independence. We interviewed bands on independent labels and we had a chat with one of the\nfounders of an independent label, Toby from\nTransgressive Records. I also took the opportunity to interview Everett True, the edi-tor-in-chief of Plan B magazine; this makes\nup part of a feature on the independent music media.\nIn designing a front page, I tried to think of\nways to convey independence. However, my\nlady friend came up with a far better idea of\nputting some boobies on the front instead.\nSo you get Liberty Leading The People promoting indieness; obscurity and lo-fi production for all.\nIn this month\u2019s bitrate section, Greg and I\nhad a discussion over what technologically\nbinds the indies; in the end it was voice ma-nipulation. A lot of people (including myself)\nwill associate indie music with a certain type\nof production, ie. clean, well-balanced and\ndull. In a lot of lo-fi music the guitars are raw\nand the vocals even rawer. This independent\nand DIY ethic is what makes a lot of independent music the way it is, so we thought\nwe\u2019d tell you (albeit negatively) how major\nlabels manipulate their artists.\nOf course there is not one way to make\nmusic \u2013 it would be dull if there was. It all depends on what you are into and we are just\nconveying a point-of-view in our features. If\nyou want to express your perspective, then\nget in touch with us through music.felix@\nic.ac.uk and write us a feature. I write a lot\nof features myself so it would be great to\nread someone else\u2019s thoughts for once. True\nindependence is expression of your opinions\nwithout fear.\nWe are all aware also that Christmas and\nNew Year\u2019s Eve is approaching and since\nthis is the last Femm before Christmas, we\nare going to give away some CDs. Thanks\nto the kind people at LD Communications,\nwe've got 5 copies of the awesome World's\nBest Mum/Dad compilation CDs to give\naway. All you have to do to enter is tell us\nin 5 words why your mum/dad is the World's\nbest, send emails to music.felix@imperial.\nac.uk with the subject title \u201cMy mum/dad\nis the best because...\u201d It is that easy.\nAlso some of you maybe back in London\nfor New Year\u2019s Eve and might want to go\nout. For those who want to be a bit \u2018independent\u2019 and go to gig night, I provided a\nshort list and explanations to where you\ncan go that might interest you. There is\nalso an All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties preview\nfor those who are going and those who\nmay not have heard of it before.\nNext Femm will also have a theme of\nWAG: Women and Guitars. We celebrate\nall the X chromosome-infused rock music\nthere is. We don\u2019t intend to be gimmicky,\nit\u2019s just so much rubbish guitar music at\nthe minute is a result of male melancho-lia; this has to be stopped. So we will be attempting to cover that. We want as many\nof you ladies to write in with your views\notherwise I will force my girlfriend to\nwrite everything and a small child called\nAlice to lay it all out.\nI hope you find some of this month\u2019s issue entertaining and enjoy reading some\nof it. It was turtuous for me to put together\nas coursework always arrives at the end\nof the term. I also hope you have a lovely\nand well-earned Christmas holiday and\ndon\u2019t spend all of it doing problem sheets.\nThe Music Felix and Femm team wish\nyou a very merry Christmas and a rockali-cious New Year. Have a happy hanukkah\nand joyful whatever religious festival you\nto choose to celebrate!\nbitrate\nEver fancied yourself as a pop star? Do\nyou long for the celebrity life, spending\nyour mountains of cash in Hollywood clubs,\nhanging out with Paris Hilton and Co. surrounded by desperate hangers on, all hoping\nto catch a glimpse of you? Have you always\nwished that it was your songs the crappy\npub DJ was playing as you drown your sorrows in the corner of some chain night-club?\nYou stay awake at night just wishing to god\nthat you had that PERFECT singing voice\nbut you just know in your heart of hearts,\nthat the horrendously out-of-tune noise you\nattempt to pass off as singing is not going to\nbe appreciated by any audience apart from\nthat rancid flannel in your mildew encrusted shower at your miserable trailer-park\nhome?\nWell, I don\u2019t, but some people do; and assuming you could pass as one of the Irish\nguys who look like they\u2019re about to make my\ndinner in front of the TV with Grandma very\nuncomfortable by dropping their pants and\nrecreating a scene from \u201c4-Way Bareback\nSailor Pimps\u201d, or you\u2019re a teenage chav\u2019s\nwet-dream eye-candy who\u2019s been dragged\nout of Southern US-of-A via the boob-job\nclinic and 18 gallons of airbrush foundation,\nthen hooray! You\u2019re in luck; you can be a\nmodern pop-singer even if your voice does\nsound like the dulcet tones of an exploding\nmoose. Anyway, I\u2019m going to run out of derogatory descriptions for pop-singers soon,\nI\u2019m too tired, and they are just not that fun-ny, so I\u2019ll get to the main point of the article\nnow.\nIt probably won\u2019t surprise you much to\nhear that almost every single studio recording (and a large proportion of live performances too) from modern pop stars has had\nmore attention from computer geeks and\ntechs than a bittorrent site purely dedicated\nto hardcore hentai movies, in the form of\nheavy computer correction of the vocals,\nand sometimes even the musical instru-ments. It\u2019s not just pop-singers either, so\ncalled \u2018alternative bands\u2019 are culprits too:\nGood Charlotte, Sum41, the list of shite\n\u2018pop-punk\u2019 bands is endless, and if you think\nthey sound terrible now \u2013 imagine what the\nsound engineers had to go through.\nThe main tool of the devil is a pitch cor-rector, a super-clever bit of studio hardware\n(or software) that by using the wonders that\nare Fast Fourier Transforms, can automatically detect the pitch of a vocal track, and\nshift it to the desired note, sound engineers\ncan make a totally out-of-tune vocal sound\nalmost perfect, greatly cutting the time and\nartist skill required to make a recording.\nLive pitch correctors even exist, and are\noften used by the likes of Britney Spears\nand Cher, they are pre-programmed with a\nperformance and controlled by the sound\ntechs so that the voice channel is routed\nthrough the hardware and corrected before\nbeing heard by the audience (although lip-synching is also often used). So great, now\nyou can give a performance that resembles\nthe drunken karaoke at the local working\nmen\u2019s club, and those clever guys behind\nthe scenes will make it sound wonderful!\nIt must be confessed though, that although\npitch correction is greatly overused by some\nartists, it still has its uses, fixing one or two\nnotes in an album is hardly considered to be\ncheating, and anyway, if you have a terrible\nsong, performed appallingly then no amount\nof pitch correction is going to make it sound\ngood (unfortunately we\u2019re not living that far\nin the future yet). But we\u2019re rubbish at singing right? Someone else is going to write the\nactual lyrics so it should be OK, so turn that\npitch mofo up to maximum setting, we want\nto sound like we\u2019ve had 15 years of the best,\nmost intensive singing training when we release our debut single.\nSo, now that the pitch is all sorted, another\ncommon manipulation to vocals in popular\nmusic is the use of a chorus filter, which as\nlong as it is used correctly, can transform\nyour feeble little (already pitch-corrected)\nGregory Mead\nfemm 2\nFriday 8th December 2006\nMatty Hoban\nsinging voice into a rich, glittering per-formance. This effect is also used for the\nmusical instruments in some tracks giving them more presence and superior\nsound. Of course, if the settings are wrong\nthen it\u2019ll sound like an entire church choir\nis performing your number which may not\nbe the desired effect, especially during a\nlive performance. The choir filter works\nby analysing the input signal, creating a\nseries of very slightly pitch shifted copies\nof it and then overlaying them back onto\neach other, giving the impression of more\nthan one source of the sound. It can sound\nlovely, or it can sound ghastly, depending\nwhere it is used.\nAnother fun vocal effect we should always consider when embarking on the\ncreation of a new pop song is the vocoder.\nThis smart machine has two inputs, generally one voice input and one instrument\ninput (e.g. keyboard) and by using some\nvery clever mathematical transforms, or\nsome crazy analogue filters if you\u2019re living in the 70\u2019s, splits up the voice signal\ninto a given number of its main constituent waveforms, which are then recreated\nusing a new fundamental frequency from\nthe instrument. You can create some cool\nmanipulations of your voice pitch shifting\nto a tune you play on a keyboard, or even\nbetter \u2013 you can make yourself sound like\na robot (see Daft Punk and Kraftwerk for\noveruse of this effect), so it doesn\u2019t matter squat how badly you sing, in these instances you can just speak the lyrics into\na microphone and it sounds AWESOME,\nso if you are a budding pop star and your\nsinging voice is so appalling that not even\nthe pitch corrector can save it from obliv-ion, you might want to consider electronic\npop music as your path to superstardom.\nAn entire arsenal of other effects and\nmanipulations are available to the sound\nrecording engineer, allowing them to\nmake the perfect track basically from\nscratch, you don\u2019t need to sing for shit,\nother people will write your songs and\nsession musicians will perform the mu-sic! Or, if you want to form a band, your\nother members don\u2019t even need to be able\nto play their instruments, pitch correctors\nwork even better on musical instruments\nthan they do on voices! So what are you\nwaiting for? Just make sure you shag the\nright people in the music industry and you\nmight find yourself the next one-hit-won-der this Christmas.\nYo La Tengo play at the Kentish\nTown Forum in North London: \u201cI\nleft soundly knowing that there\nare some good musicians alive\nand well and brimming with\nideas.\u201d\nfeatures\n4\n6\nEverett True, editor-in-chief\nof Plan B: \u201cOne suspects they\n[NME] think females making\nmusic is a fad, which is weird,\nbecause personally I think males\nmaking music is a fad and I wish\nit would stop.\u201d PAGE 8\n\u201cIt is sold out and it is far away\nfrom London but the independent music festival, All Tomorrow\u2019s Parties\u2019 Nightmare Before\nChristmas is happening this\nweekend.\u201d PAGE 10\nWin this CD!\nRead editorial for more info!\n\n"

    "content": "90s style\nFashion is cyclical, and\nwe've already done the\n60s, 70s and 80s to death.\nThe 90s time is now. I\ncan see the sceptical look\nupon your face, but you'll\ncome around. After all\nfashion is linked to music,\nand with all the 90s group\ncomebacks, fashion is not\nfar behind.\nUnicorns and magical\nthings\nEspecially in the form of\njewellery. As seen at Topshop, with silver chain\nnecklaces and earrings\nwith plastic & mirrored\ncharms of unicorns, stars\nand other magical paraphernalia attached. Also\nsee, Pan's Labyrinth, a\nfilm out now, split between\ntwo tales; one fantastical,\nthe other a civil war.\nLela Rose\nHer New York Collection\nis super-cute, with ruffled\nnecklines, and pastel colours paired with black and\nolive tones.\nSarah Harding for Ultimo\nSo trashy.

Do\nUltimo really want this\nimage? Then again, chavs\nbuy underwear too.\nShaken, certainly not stirred\nFolake Adegbohun checks out the Afro-Caribbean Society's spectacular fashion show\n30 felix Friday 8 December 2006\nFASHION fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nture decides to use a theme from\na western film to showcase it\u2019s finest of all finery. However do not be\nfooled by the contradicting theme.\nThe action film theme gave a mixture of electric sexiness and explosiveness to the show.\nThe show began with Grace Jones\n(Wendy) wearing a red jumpsuit and\nbullet belt from Twinkled. LSE\u2019s\nvery own ACS President Nnamdi\nThe Afrogala, hosted by the AfroCaribbean Society on the 25th of\nNovember 2006, was one of ICU\u2019s\nbiggest events. The main highlight\nof the show was the Fashion Show\nwhich was in theme with the recent\nBond movie \u201cCasino Royale\u201d.\nThis was, unlike most fashion\nshows, certainly unique. How ironic\nthat a show based on demonstrating the African and Caribbean culAwa\u2013Kalu, was a bad guy, wearing\na waistcoat and trousers, both in\nblack, accompanied by 3 bad girls\nErica, Amaka Akobundu and Odiri\nObrutse. All were wearing identical\noutfits; silk Chinese gowns and vintage blue brassiere from Twinkled.\nThe show had a general theme for\nthe guys, which was quite boring. It\nconsisted of standard pin-striped\nwaistcoats and plain trousers but\nthe accessories, such as the bowler\nhat worn by Remi and the blue lion\ntie, from Twinkled, were thrilling.\nFortunately the same cannot be\nsaid for the female models. The\noutfits were extraordinarily electrifying with KCL\n\u2019s epitome of sexy,\nCharissa Hu, spotting a jaw dropping Dolce and Gabbana bra with\nsilk shorts and an Aquascutum\ntrench coat. IC\u2019s Vese Aghoghovbia\nand Louisa Awolaja were both wearing a brownish red leather jackets,\nberets and white dresses with neck\nties, both outfits from Twinkled.\nThe Bond girl played by Ojuigo\nNdukwe bewitched us with an elegantly worn Sue Wong, hand bead-ed, beige silk dress. Shaun Githuku\nemulated Bond to perfection as he\ngraced the stage in a white tux jack-et, worn with black trousers and a\nblack shirt with a black bow tie. It\nmost certainly gave him a licence\nto thrill.\nThe show was undoubtedly a suc-cess, with something for everyone,\nfrom retro to sheer class. Even if\nthe scripted scenes did momentarily detract the limelight from the\noutfits, one hardly noticed as the\noverall effect was dazzling. With all\nthe pizzazz oozing from the models,\nthe funky outfits and the melodramatic acting onlookers can only\nwish that they too could look so effortlessly chic, who says Halloween\ncan\u2019t be everyday.\nA big thank you to Amena Imasekha and Ngozi Ofili-Okonkwo\nthe organisers of the show. Most of\nthe clothes worn and all the props\nwere kindly provided by Twinkled\n(www.twinkled.net), a vintage shop\nin Kingly court on Carnaby Street.\nFelix fashion police: what not to wear\nWill.I.Am looks like he's channelling Willy Wonka here. Actually, he\njust looks like he wants to be him.\nHe's probably having a house made\nof candy being built as we speak.\nJustin Timberlake, however, looks\ngood enough to eat in grey, red and\nblack.\nOK, her face looks a bit like a foetus.\nI hear prolific \"partying\" (or snorting a small country's GDP worth\nof drugs) does that to you. But the\nmonochrome look is hot. Just remember to put some pants on when\nclambering out of a limousine in\nfront of the leering paparazzi.\nWonderful dress on Lily Allen or\nanyone below 25. Seriously, how old\nis this women? You'd have to carbon date her! You can't tell from her\nbotoxed face, which is probably 90%\nplastic and animal derivatives, 10%\nhuman. This fact is only highlighted\nby her lolita-style dress.\nGwen Stefani looks super kawai! I'll\nbe disappointed if Japanese people\ndon't actually say \"super kawai\".

An ex-Rus-sian spy who co-authored the book\nBlowing up Russia: Terror from\nWithin is murdered with a poison\nunfamiliar to the natural world.\nHis drawn-out death implicated\nsuspects among the country\u2019s diplomatic and secret services, whilst\nVlad et al, wrapped in furs and twiddling their Faberge eggs surrounded by watchful Rokotov portraits in\none of the many gilded rooms of the\nKremlin, calling the incident \u2018unfortunate\u2019 along with a whole host of\nother inoffensive adjectives.\nWith a trail of radiation leading all\nthe way to Moscow, was it Putin who\nordered the unfortunate\u2019s death?\nBut, as many commentators convincingly point out, is Putin foolish\nenough to have someone murdered\nso publicly? Or perhaps it was, as\nthe official line goes, a small part in\na larger picture trying to discredit\nRussia? Officials from the ex-com-munist state at one point indicted\nLondon resident Boris Berezovsky,\nan exiled billionaire and critic of\nVladimir Putin. Traces of the now\nnotorious substance were found at\nhis offices in Mayfair last Monday.\nIt could simply be a matter of personal revenge, though the culprit\nwould have required access to materials found only in reactors.\nThere are so many questions\nthat will almost certainly never be\nanswered. Could Litvinenko have\nstumbled upon a secret organisation run by lizard people who control the minds of world leaders?\nThe big question on everybody\u2019s\nlips around the world must be \u201cso\nwhat\u2019s Tony going to do about it\nall?\u201d. Months from retirement\n(hours if we are to believe everything written in the press these\ndays), will the British Prime Minister stand up for a man who risked,\nand ultimately gave, his life for a\ncause he called \u2018noble\u2019? Surely tensions and suspicions between the\nold cold war enemies must have\nworsened?\nAccording to the larger picture,\nthat course of action seems desperately unlikely, despite Mr Blair saying last Tuesday that \u201cno diplomatic\nor political barrier\u201d will hamper in-vestigations. Blair has only spoken\ngenerously of his Russian counter-part, and publicly supports Russia\u2019s\nprivate war on terror in Chechnya.\nEven George Bush, he who oversees the occupation (or liberation\nSign Britain away\nThe UK\u2019s highest court ruled last\nweek that two British men (one a\nformer employee of Imperial College) may be extradited to the\nUnited States. The court did not immediately rule on whether the two\nmen could appeal the decision to\nthe House of Lords, Britain\u2019s highest tribunal.\nIf certification is not given by the\nHigh Court, then the appeal stage\nto the House of Lords will not go\nahead. After that extradition is\na real possibility within a short\nspace of time, as previous cases\nhave shown. On the other hand, if\npermitted, the legal team will have\n14 days to argue over points of law\nsurrounding the extradition deci-sion, namely those concerning Military Detention and Rendition.\nFailing that, the last appeal stage\nis to the European Court of Human\nRights. In both cases, a lower court\njudge allowed extradition after receiving assurances from US authorities that they would not seek the\ndeath penalty, put the men before\nmilitary tribunals or declare them\n\u201cenemy combatants\u201d. This coming\nfrom the government that brought\nyou the likes of the illegal war in\nIraq, the extra-judicial procedure of\nExtraordinary Rendition, the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison and\nthe injustices of the Guantanamo\nBay concentration camp.\nThe lawyer for both men, Edward\nif you swing that way) of a country\nnow subject to one hundred plus incidents per day of murder, rape and\nkidnap, described the conflict in the\nnear east region as \u201cchaotic\u201d. Perhaps Tony\u2019s stance has something\nto do with Britain\u2019s growing dependence on petroleum imports, or\nperhaps not. Maybe Tony is looking\non pro-Putin Gerhard Schroeder\u2019s\nappointment to the board of directors of Gazprom on the day of his\nelection defeat as a promising sign\nof things to come, or maybe not.\nHowever Mr Blair decides to navigate this political minefield though,\nwhat is clear is how cheesed off the\nKremlin is about the publicity an\notherwise discreet matter has re-ceived; the embassy has allegedly\nvented their anger at the cabinet\nfor not imposing an executive decision to contain Litvinenko\u2019s volatile\ncomments and ensure privacy.\nNine Scotland Yard detectives\nhave flown to Moscow to continue\ntheir investigation, and last Friday, it was announced the Prime\nMinister from the early 90s Yegor\nGaidar had fallen \u2018mysteriously\u2019 ill\nin Dublin.\nIt demonstrates clearly and publicly that, as long as the Russian\nFederation has the power to sell\nand buy nuclear warheads, and the\none-time head of its secret service\nas president, it can do whatever the\nhell it wants.

The resulting\nmess meant we had to call upon the\nhelp of the dark side to re-attach\nStar Wars\u2019 head with steri-strips!\nWith the team patched up, warmed\nup and after half an hour of waiting\nfor the umpires to arrive it was time\nfor battle to commence.\nIC took advantage of the Medics\nmorphine-enriched state-of-being\nand shipped three clinical goals\nfrom Jumaji and Star Wars past\nthem quicker than you can say \u2018cadaver\u2019 before conceding two highly\ndubious goals prior to half-time.\nRatty showed his prowess in front\nof goal, leaving the Medic defence\nprevented many Medic chances;\nthe ever present Shipman (who\nhas now retired from medicine)\nand the ever-injured Foetus working well together in the middle,\nwith wing-backs Mountie and Skipper Harvester feeding the midfield\nwell.

Earlier in the term only a\nlate Medic goal prevented us from\nbeating the Imperial Medic 1st XI,\nthe result being an unfortunate\n2-2 draw, which quite rightly was\ncelebrated emphatically by the\nMedic 1st XI as they had amazingly managed to grab a draw.\nNow, to elaborate on the chosen\nheadline. I must tell you that the title of 3rd Team Hunks was not chosen by our modest team of freshers\nand old-pros but was decided by the\nsupporters of Bucks University the\nprevious Wednesday. At the sight\nof our entrance onto the pitch,\nwhispers were overheard from the\nBucks substitutes suggesting that\nwewere\u201cawellgood-lookingteam.\u201d\nI won\u2019t deny that we count in\nour ranks a number of heartbreakers but who are we to suggest that we are the fittest team\nat Imperial? We are actually the\nfittest team at Imperial, though.\nTo the game! A late fitness test\nsaw breaking news across the tabloid press. Tim Hoult, our rock in\ndefence, was suffering from concussion after head-butting a Bucks\nplayer in our previous fixture. Unswerved, we decided our best tactic\nforsuchagamewouldbetokeepthe\nball for the first 20 minutes, which\nas expected led to Medics putting\nin some lame tackles to try to gain\nsome possession. At this point Jai\nDave taught them how to tackle\nproperly in a classic man-and-ball\ntackle, which signalled our decision\nto start creating a few chances.\nThe first goal came mid-way\nthrough the half. A Deemo\nGeorghiou through ball found AK\nwho ran through on goal, only to\nhave his effort blocked by the onrushing keeper. The block left\nthe ball high in the air for the incoming Jai Dave to head the ball\nover the two defenders blocking the goal and into an open net.\nThis meant we could relax for\nthe rest of the half and laugh at\nthe Medic cheerleader who found\nhimself playing central-midfield.\nHe sure could talk, but he did not\ntouch the ball once in the first half,\nwhich is quite embarrassing seeing as he was playing in the centre of the pitch. Seriously, mate.\nThe first half finished with long-range efforts from Sam Rickards\nand Stewart Masters, who had\ndone more than anyone to ensure\nwe went into the interval ahead.\nThe second half saw an acceptance from the Medics that\nthey couldn\u2019t play football as they\nswitched style and sent a barrage\nof long-balls over the centre backs\nheads. They were dealt with easily by Jan Marchant in central defence and Milky Botchway in goal.\nHowever, the cheerleader was\nstill maintaining they were still\nin the game and that the number\nof attacking chances we were\ncreating would come to nothing.\nThe second goal came from a\npenalty. The first attempt was a\nshocker as Captain James Blyth\nforgot that his most potent weapon\nis his shin and not his right foot and\nsent a tame shot down the keeper\u2019s\nthroat. However, cleverly Max Steel\nhad encroached into the box dragging Medic defenders with him,\nwhich led to the referee asking for\nthe penalty to be retaken. AK slotted the second attempt away nicely.\nSome late pressure gave the\nMedics a scrabbled goal from a\ncorner but the introduction of The\nCamel, and some fine central midfield work from playmaker Adam\nMasters, added the extra composure needed to see out the rest of\nthe game. It was a deserved win,\nwhich saw some good football in the\nfirst half and a fine effort against\nthe conditions in the second half.\nSeriously though, Medics,\nyou still have a chance at Varsity as we have beaten our 2nd\nXI as well as yours. No excuses\nfrom the Medic 3rd XI either as\nthe Hunks fancy their chances.\n(Definition: Hunk \u2013 a well-built, sexually attractive man.)\nThe lads after getting their choppers seen to (the ones in their gums, you dirty old fool)\ncorner routine saw the ball move\nbetween Date Rape, Star Wars\nand finally Batty, slotting one in between the Medics. To his credit, the\nMedic defender who intercepted\nthat flight of the ball on his back did\nactually play on \u2013 no harm done!\nDespite their best efforts, the\nscum never really got back into the\ngame.

The residents, reportedly\nmostly students from the College,\nwere led to safety by fire crews\nand ten were taken to hospital. One\nstudent had to be rescued from the\nthird floor of the building by ladder\nafter the smoke became too thick\nfor them to exit via the ground\nfloor.\nThe likely cause of the fire, according to the Fire Brigade, was\na tumble dryer in the basement of\nthe building. The smoke from the\ninitial blaze filled the upper floors\nof the building, causing the inhalation injuries. The basement of the\nbuilding has been severely dam-aged, and the thick smoke has damaged the rest of the block to varying\ndegrees.\nFire crews investigating the\nscene discovered that the fire alert\nsystem had been tampered with,\npossibly maliciously, as all the\nbreak-glass from the alert boxes\nwas missing. It is not clear who is\nresponsible for this. The building\nhad numerous other problems with\nregards to fire safety, including fire\ndoors being wedged open, defective\nemergency escape lighting, a lack\nof fire action notices, and defective fire-fighting equipment. The\nlandings of the building were also\nblocked by stored furniture, making escape difficult.

However, the block is popular\nwith IC students due to its proximity to the campus; the building\nhas 12 separate flats, with 5 or 6\nstudents in each flat. The Fire Brigade has indicated that should the\nincident have occurred at night,\nthe situation could have been much\nmore serious.\nReaders are reminded that\nchecking the fire safety equipment\nin rented property is of vital importance - for example, check that\nextinguishers have regular maintenance markings, and that any\nsmoke alarms are tested regularly.\nAny faults should be immediately\nreported to the landlord or letting\nagent.

    "content": "Fairytales, fauns, and Franco\u2019s fascists\nPan\u2019s Labyrinth \u2013 brutal, cruel, innocent, and unnervingly beautiful. A fairytale fit for the the Brothers Grimm\nIt says a lot about a film when the\nreviewer\u2019s only real problem lies\nin its marketing. Pan\u2019s Labyrinth,\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s latest work,\nhas suffered somewhat from being\ntrailed as a surrealist fantasy along\nthe lines of Alice in Wonderland, The\nDark Crystal, and the like. Whilst\nthis is obviously not wholly without\nbasis, the surreal elements are few\nand far between. The majority of the\nstory is firmly based in reality, concerningresistanceagainstFranco\u2019s\nfascist regime in the countryside of\npost-civil war Spain. Furthermore,\nthe Wonderlandesque diversions\nare not the light-hearted escapism\none might expect, but every bit as\nbrutal and unforgiving as the real\nworld. Rather than the historical\ncontext providing a backdrop for a\nstraightforward fantasy tale, is is\nthe fanstastic aspects which frame\na sober tale of conflict.\nAs with so many tales following\nthe Wonderland archetype, the\nstory concerns a young girl, Ofelia,\nsomewhat neglected by her family:\nher expectant mother, too distracted by her problematic pregnancy\nto pay much attention to Ofelia;\nand her new husband, the sadistic\nCaptain Vidal in the \u2018wicked stepmother\u2019 role: concerned neither for\nhis wife nor stepdaughter, but only\nfor his as-yet unborn son. While\nOfelia\u2019s mother is laid up in bed and\nCaptain Vidal combs the countryside for rebels, Ofelia herself is left\nto explore the surrounding area.\nNearby she finds the eponymous\nlabyrinth, at the heart of which\nreasides a fawn who, in the nature\nof these things, sets her certain\ntasks.\nThe body of the film alternates between the continuing guerilla war\nbetween the anti-fascist resistance\nand Captain Vidal\u2019s troops, and\nOfelia\u2019s semi-Herculean undertak-ings; never settling for too long on\nany one plot strand. This constant\nshifting between grim reality and\nwhat could be called a Grimm reality serves to unsettle the viewer\neven further than the strands do\nindividually. While the contrast is\nsometimes jarring, it never feels\nas though the two sides to the story\nare at odds, and the parallels between the historical and folkloric\nelements are suitably highlighted,\nespecially when the stories run\nback into each other.\nThere are a few minor irritations,\nhowever - the use of folklore occasionally drifts into clich\u00e9 at the expense of characterisation and not\na little goodwill on the part of the\naudience. It is generally held that\nthe protagonist will receive a dire\nwarning and will fail to heed it, and\nhere is no exception, but the manner in which it unfolds is utterly out\nof character, especially after the\nwarning had been very deliberately\nrepeated beforehand and again at\nthe time. Perhaps the irritation lies\nmore with the anticipation of the\nfailing than with the act itself, and\nthat its inevitability is the source of\nthe problem rather mere predict-ability. Regardless, it proves a distraction from an otherwise highly\nimmersing film, drawing the viewer\naway from its carefully constructed\nworld.\nDel Toro\u2019s use of imagery and\nfolklore runs throughout his work,\nthough nowhere is it quite so pronounced as here. Motifs from his\nprevious films are instantly recog-nisable: most notably the labyrinth\nitself echoes a similar construction\nin his unfairly maligned Hellboy, as\ndo many of the creatures which inhabit the film. This serves to highlight their differences all the more\nTo celebrate the January release\nof Babel, Felix, in conjunction with\nAccomodation For Students and\nParamount Vantage, has 5 pairs\nof tickets to the\nLondon preview\nscreening to give\naway.\nThe third film\nfrom the writer/\ndirector team of\nGuillermo Arriaga and Alejandro\nGonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Babel follows in a similar\nfashion to its pre-cursors: Amores\nPerros, and 21\nGrams.\nUsing the device of a single\ncataclysmic\nevent, the pair\nhave previously explored such general ideas as responsibility and for-Win Babel tickets\n- whilst his most recent English language films have been contemporary urban works, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth\nis a return to the historical settings\nof his earlier works: particularly\nThe Devil\u2019s Backbone - also set in\nthe aftermath of the Spanish civil\nwar and to which it forms something of a thematic sequel. It too\neschews any urban trappings for\na wholly rural setting, lending the\nwork a deeply organic feel. The cinematography plays this aspect up\nto its fullest, and everything from\nthe most mundane clearing to the\ngrandiose world briefly glimpsed at\npoints throughout the film are stunning in their realisation.\nFor all its visual splendour how-ever, this is a film about barbarism\nand intense cruelty. Made manifest\nin Vidal and some of his more esoteric brethren, there are sequences\nof severe brutality that feel calculated to shock and make the\nexperience deeply uncomfortable\nand unsettling. At points it even\napproaches the realm of the genuinely harrowing. But for all this, it is\na thoroughly entertaining film - its\ninconsistencies and incongruities\nlend it even greater texture, and\nwhile it wants for humour, it never\ndescends to the bleak.

    "content": "live\nIt was the turn for Camden to\nhost Yo La Tengo tonight. An\nAmerican dreamy, noise-pop\ntrio, promoting their last release,\nI Am Not Afraid Of You And I Will\nBeat Your Ass, on my home turf,\nI grapsed this rare chance to see\nthem.\nHugely consistent veterans of\nthe music world, amassing over\n10 LPs - a sign of their talents,\nvariety, and greatness. A pre-mier-league band. Churning out\ntheir latest release with quite acclaim it\u2019s hard to see when YLT\nwill stop.\nPlace these guys in The Forum,\nan old art-deco cinema, a venue\nwith a history for hosting legends\nof the genre, meant for a specta-cle. But standing in the queue\noutside in the cold for 20 minutes\nbefore realising that the ticket\nin my hand meant I could enter\nstraight away, I missed the support act. Walking past the casual\nbag inspector into the standing\nsection, I fought my way into the\nmass of fans to gain a good spot,\nthe 2,000 capacity filling up.\nShortly after 9pm Ira made\nhis way upon stage, followed by\nYo La Tengo\nKentish Town Forum\nHHHHI\nfemm 4\nFriday 8th December 2006\nhis wife, Georgia and long time friend/band\nmate, James. YLT began with a mellow, autumnal track, displaying the singing capabilities of their female drummer/vocalist.\nSwitching back from the main microphone to\nthe drums lead to a rockier follow-on, Pass\nthe Hatchet \u2013 a noisy nine-minute six-string\nfreak-out, supported with a framework of\nsubtle drumming and basslines.\nThe well-engineered acoustics in The Forum meant my ears weren\u2019t deafened after\nevery struck chord; I could enjoy YLT for the\nduration.\nAfter a marvellous 3 songs, Ira began\nspeaking with the crowd. After the recent\nhospitalisation of the Bloc Party drummer\nfor presumably going to the edge at one of\ntheir tours, they highlighted the physicality\nof drumming, joking that Georgia was capable of going quite mad \u2013 \u201chopefully this won\u2019t\nhappen right here\u201d.\nShifting gears, the set continued regardless with Sugarcube, a powerful, crunching guitar-led song that stands out as one of\ntheir greatest, which was greeted well. The\nset progressed, punctuated with intervals of\ndream-like tracks comparable to My Bloody\nValentine, bringing together hits from their\nmass of albums.\nWith a band like YLT, with such an immense back catalogue, there\u2019s always going\nto be songs that you wished they played but\ndidn\u2019t. They\u2019ve certainly taken the negative\nreviews of the last gigs (playing mostly Bsides) to heart and certainly made amends,\nexciting the crowds with fan favourites like\nTom Courteney, before moving into longer\nYo La Tengo up in Kentish Town\nUS indie stalwarts accompany Tool and The Sunshine Underground\nTool and Mastodon\nWembley Arena\nI\u2019ve wanted to see Tool for a fair\nfew years now, and I\u2019ve heard\nquite a lot of conflicting reports\nabout their live act; \u201cmesmerising\u201d and \u201ctedious\u201d are the adjectives I\u2019ve heard most often. It just\ngoes to show that the one thing\nthat can be agreed on is that\nTool excels at dividing opinion.\nEverything they\u2019ve ever done\nhas attracted praise and scorn in\nvirtually equal measure. Having\nshelled out \u00a330 for a ticket, I obviously wasn\u2019t a hater, although\nI must admit that some of the\nmore zealous fans I have spoken\nto have occasionally shown a disturbingly cult-like adulation for\nthe band!\nArriving at Wembley Arena following a tube journey that was\nsomething of an epic in itself, we\ngot to our seats just as the prog-metal monsters Mastodon had\nkicked off with one of the many\nanthems from their latest album,\nominously titled Blood Mountain. Unfortunately, their set\nturned out to be a bit of a damp\nsquib, as the half-full, half-inter-ested Wembley Arena struggled\nto hear the tunes past the bowel-emptying levels of bass. A typical\nproblem with loud opening acts\nat big arenas; yet even taking\ninto account the absence of such\ncontributors to said album as Josh Homme\nof Queens of the Stone Age fame, I felt disappointingly ambivalent over their perform-ance. Fortunately, the last few tracks taken\nfrom Leviathan made up for this, setting the\nstage nicely for what would come next.\nWhat followed was a tense, suspenseful\nwait for Tool, during which everyone who\nhadn\u2019t bothered to turn up for Mastodon\nfilled up the arena. 45 minutes later the\nheadliners appeared. Front-man \u201cMaynard\u201d James Keenan, only 5\u201d7, was utterly\ndwarfed by the rest of the band (average\nheight 6\u201d4), but clearly marked out by his\nbright orange jacket and bright red Mohican. Indeed, it really must be added here\nthat Tool\u2019s stage presence really was something to behold, with Maynard sporting the\nTaxi Driver look against a background of\nvideo screens displaying the bizarro quasi-mystical-sci-fi-bullshit art of Adam Jones.\nThus all doubts about this not being Tool\nwere systematically removed like any kind\nof termite or roach!\nAs soon as the distinctive introduction to\nStinkfist begun to ring out, the arena erupted into mass jubilation; strange when you\nconsider that the song alludes to a sex act!\nIndeed, the lyrical content on most of their\nsongs has a fairly subversive element to it,\nsuch that they have often attracted the ire\nof religious groups. Then again, the actual\nsincerity of the implied hedonism or \u2018Satanism\u2019 is quite debatable. They then made the\nfrankly unusual choice of making Swamp\nSong their only inclusion from their first\nproper full-length, Undertow. It certainly\nsent some people off-kilter, but went down a\nkiller with the crowd nonetheless, even if it\nwas a fairly straightforward hard-rock piece\ncompared with the trance-like progressive\nmetal most fan boys have come to worship\nTool for. Before long they had launched into\nJambi, which was followed by Schism, thus\nshowing off their evolution well in the space\nof four songs\u2019 range. So far, so pleasantly\nsurprised!\n\u201cGood evening! I have good news and I\nThe Sunshine Underground\nKing\u2019s College London Union\nThe Sunshine Underground are one of a\nnumber of new bands coming out of Leeds.\nThey make up part of the emerging New\nRave (or, as the Metro describes them,\n\u201cfunk-punk\u201d) scene \u2013 think Klaxons, but\nwith tunes. We set off on a cold November\nTuesday to go to the KCL Student Union, a\nAh, the famous problem of who is going to solo first. Solution: no solos\nCHRIS PARROTT\nmelodies with The Story of and the hypnotic\nBlue Line Swinger. The latter begins hesitantly as a group of loose musicians playing\ntheir own thing, uniting slowly, building up\nto one mind-blowing climax \u2013 as heavenly as\nmusic gets.\nThanking the fans before disappearing for\na break, YLT came back to deliver a fan fa-vourite, Today is the Day. These aging rock\nstars, getting tired, had another break \u2013 well\ndeserved. Maybe three encores was a bit\ntoo self-indulgent, but they came back to\nplay requests from keen front row-ers. Ira\ngave a look to the other band members,\nAutumn Sweater, a groovy, stand-out\ntrack that closed out their second encore.\nThey ended the night with one last song.\nIncredible.\nI left soundly knowing that there are\nsome good musicians alive and well and\nbrimming with ideas.\nChristopher Parrott\nhave bad news\u201d bellowed Maynard. \u201cI'll start\nwith the good news. Good news: On drums,\nDanny Carey; Irish! On guitar, Adam Jones;\nWelsh! And on bass, Justin Chancellor; English! (Got the most cheers, naturally) And\nthe bad news is: there is no bad news!\u201d I\u2019d\npretty much guessed from the lack of Sober\nthat this was Tool on a high, something confirmed as they proceeded to plough through\nmost of 10,000 Days in the space of the next\nhour.\nDespite doubts from many, including my-self, that this album was leaning too much\ntowards the kind of alterna-pop produced by\nMaynard\u2019s other big project APC (A Perfect\nCircle), songs such as Rosetta Stoned and\nThe Pot came across much better live and\nwere fantastically well received, whilst the\nsolemn title track itself was almost overshadowed by the accompanying laser show.\nBut of course, they had come with the intention to rock, and rock they did with their\nmathematically-derived prog opus Lateralus and 10,000 Days opener Vicarious. And\nthen they triumphantly finished with the\nangst-ridden epic, \u00c6nima, a rant against\ntheir adopted home of Los Angeles inspired\nby late comedian Bill Hicks. The band then\nbowed out for an extended standing ovation\nat the end, with an intense feeling of euphoria throughout. If there was a song I would\nhave personally liked them to have played, it\nwas Parabola; but now that would\u2019ve been\ntoo perfect.\nAlex McKitrick\ncosy venue with a perfect atmosphere for\na band of this type, expecting a torrent of\ndrunken indie dance and glowsticks.\nSupports Friendly Fires and Ghost Frequency did almost as little to impress as\nthe bar prices. Friendly Fires were appropriate perhaps in style but all their songs\nseemed to blend into a rather uninteresting twenty minutes. More time song writ-ing, less time buying confetti perhaps?\nGhost Frequency were totally out of place\nwith their brand of muddy emo and received little encouragement from the\naudience.\nThe Sunshine Underground were therefore received with relief and excitement\nwhen they launched into set opener Wake\nUp. This was followed up immediately\nwith perhaps their best known song, Put\nYou In Your Place. It was at this point that\nthe crowd really started to liven up \u2013 the\ncrowd was jumping in unison for nearly\nthe whole night. The great songs came\nthick and fast, not least their \u201csmash\nnumber one hit\u201d (perhaps in French\nGuiana\u2026), Borders. Perhaps disappoint-ingly, You Never Party, not a bad song in\nitself, seemed a little flat and the crowd\ndidn\u2019t respond to it, perhaps because it\nwas the only non-album song in their set.\nCommercial Breakdown, the penultimate\nsong, built the crowd up to a massive climax with energetic singing and dancing,\nready for the final song Raise The Alarm\n\u2013 complete with trademark manic cow-belling and a stage invasion.\nDespite a lack of communication with\nthe crowd, the band gave a great perform-ance, with a tight dancey rhythm section\naccompanying their indie-pop tunes. As\nthere was, disappointingly, no encore,\nall that was left to do was for the band to\nthrow microphone stands at each other\nand for us to claim trophies of an extremely memorable, if exhausting, night before\nthe long journey home. This kind of thing\nis what indie gigs are all about.\nToby Shaw and Dominic Conquest\n\n"

However, if your friends don\u2019t have\ngood music taste, a magazine might help\nyou out.\nEnough NME slating, I want to discuss\nthe role \u2013 in Everett\u2019s mind \u2013 that Plan B\nplays; I think it fills a void between the vacuous nature of NME (OK, not all the slating\nwas finished) and the pretentious nature\nof publications like The Wire (independ-ent magazine that discusses more avant\ngarde artists). He [Everett] partially agrees\nwhen he says, \u201cWe like to think we\u2019re both\nvacuous and pretentious at the same time.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being vacuous!\u201d\nHe begins to chuckle a little and elaborates,\n\u201cThe problem with being vacuous (and pretentious also) by nature is that it often isn\u2019t\nentertaining for opposite reasons. I was\nactually writing about this a couple of days\nago, that the Paris Hilton single is actually\na very good single but the album is absolute\nrubbish. That is a very good example of being vacuous in small portions.\u201d Plan B came\ndirectly as a result of Careless Talk Costs\nLives ending and Everett says, \u201cCareless\nTalk enabled us to do a rival commercial\nmagazine out of it [Plan B].\u201d\nBut in his own words, Plan B is: \u201cAnother\ncommunity really. A community that is interested in searching out exciting music\nthat doesn\u2019t necessarily follow the fashions\nof the day but follows its own slightly weird,\ntangental path. It\u2019s like one big music club.\nIn the old days, there would\u2019ve been a priest\nor something.\u201d\nThis article does intend to be informative\nand so discussion should move onto the\ninternet and zines. The internet has made\nopinions more accesible; anyone can start\na music blog for free and there are many\nwords out there for you to read all over the\ninternet. A lot of these words are written\nby over-enthusiastic fans defending their\nfavourite band. There are online communities like www.DrownedinSound.com with\nforums, reviews and interviews. I often frequent the advertisement-free www.Dusted-Magazine.com for my obscure music fix and\nfor music news and happenings in the US,\nthere is www.PitchforkMedia.com.\nOn the subject of online communities, Everett True says, \u201cI\u2019m all up for online commu-nities, I love online communities. It shouldn\u2019t\nbe confused with magazines because they\nare an entirely different form of communica-tion. It\u2019s great for enthusiastic people to get\ntheir views across without having to worry\nabout toning it down at all or writing in a\ncertain style as with magazines.\u201d I read an\narticle the other week that compared online\nzines to magazines, I thought it was a bit of\na pointless exercise as I don\u2019t see many people reading books on their laptop screens.\nEverett seems to agree when he says, \u201cIt\u2019s\nlike saying just because something is being\nshown on TV means you shouldn\u2019t listen to\nthe radio. TV and radio are two entirely different media in the way that the internet and\nmagazines are different. I am really shocked\nthat after all this time, people are still confusing the two.\u201d Of things online, he also\nthinks that, \u201cMySpace is just fantastic, it\u2019s\nso much fun, and YouTube\u2019s the same way.\u201d\nMusic should be accessible and the internet\nhas revolutionised this, so much so that the\nestablishment has grown to fear it in some\nways. Back to home ground in some ways\nwith the fanzine. I asked what he thought the\nrole of the zine is, he responded: \u201cIt depends\nwhy you listen to music, and what you get\nout of it, but personally I always loved writing that makes me feel enthusiastic about\nmusic, and makes you want to check it out.\nZines are incredibly important, even now,\nespecially now in electronic form or written form. I think they\u2019re great because they\nmake people enthused about music. This is\none of the reasons why I like Artrocker. It\nis made by a bunch of people, who are not\nthe most professional in the world but are\nenthusiastic about their music.\u201d I recommend you all go out now and make a zine\nabout your favourite music and distribute it\nat wherever you frequent, or even better, get\ntogether and make one. Write about some-thing. Do something. Now!\nFrom top to bottom above: Artrocker, DrownedinSound, Dusted Magazine, Pitchfork\nUseful links of Independent Media\nPlan B Magazine\nDusted Magazine\nDrownedinSound\nArtrocker\nPlaylouder\nPitchfork\nThe Wire\nThe Imperial and LSE (possibly with UCL and King\u2019s College inclusion) Alternative Music Societies are planning on starting a zine in the new year.

    "content": "femm 6\nFriday 8th December 2006\nartists\nin\nfocus\nMeet the future of the indies\nGoing with our independence theme\nths week, James Millen has a word\nwith Jeremy Warmsley, who is on\nTransgressive Records, after his\nrecent gig at 93 Feet East and Matty\nHoban introduces Blood Red Shoes\nwho have released records through\nmany indie labels\nT\nhere was that tingle in the air that\ntold me it was time\nto head out to East\nLondon again, a\nmagical land full of curry houses and trendy accountants.\nThe draw was Jeremy Warmsley, a fine singer-songwriter\nwho combines indie with laptop wizardry. I took my children on the green line (daddy\nloves you), and we avoided the\ngauntlet of Indian food outlets\nthat is Brick Lane to reach the\ntrendy warehouse-esque arts\nand experimental music venue 93ft East.\nThe first band on was run\nby Jeremy\u2019s keyboardist Tom\nRodgerson. It was all rather\nabstract, with Saxamophone\nand a drummer drumming\nwith pencils. But then at the\nend it got LOUD, and you, I and\napple pie know LOUD is good.\nSo they saved themselves.\nWe missed out on next band\nAbsentee since some brash\nrogues accosted us from\nacross the street at Vibe Bar.\nThese handsome scoundrels\nwere none other than Future Corpses, Imperial\u2019s only\ndecent band (you heard me\nJazz&Rock, what ya gonna\ndo about it eh?) They seem to\nhave upped their game from\npost-rock-by-numbers-+-vio-lin to rocking a bit like really\nearly (and I mean really early,\nscenesters) Biffy Clyro, a comment that I was sure was going\nto bring me pain, but instead\nfound hugs. Aw, youse guys!\nI chaperoned the kids across\nthe road and back into 93ft\nEast for a nifty \u00a33.50 pint of\nAsahi (I\u2019m so cool), and awaited Mr. Warmsley. Now I was\nrather excited, being quite a\nfan, and was curious as to how\nhe\u2019d reconcile his heavily laptop altered music live. Another favourite of\nmine, Martin Grech, gets over the technology boundary by turning all his live songs\ninto metal. One can but dream. So onto the\nstage strolls young Jeremy, with his indie-boy haircut and black-rimmed rectangular\nglasses. He launches into the pleasant jan-gle/marching band song I promise to the\ndelight of the crowd.\nLive he uses a standard set up, bass gui-tar, keyboards, drums, an underused laptop\nand himself switching between keyboard\nand guitar. The band is very tight, and relies\non no fancy effects. The best way to sum up\nhow it sounded was given by Jeremy himself\nlater in our chat: \u201cWe do cover versions of\nJeremy Warmsley songs\u201d. It was perfectly\nsatisfying in general, due to Jeremy\u2019s great\nvoice and the general musicianship and\nquality of song writing. It fell down when he\ndecided to do a slightly limp acoustic version\nof 5 Verses, an otherwise amazing song, that\nwould require some technical gymnastics to\npull off live.\nHe\u2019s only one album, an EP and a spattering of singles in, so there wasn\u2019t so much ma-terial. Highlights included forthcoming single I believe in the way you move and album\nopener Dirty Blue Jeans. I was surprised at\nhow perfect his voice was, I suspected that it\nmight be a bit hit-and-miss from record, but\na heavy touring schedule has kicked it into\nshape. There was at least one new song fea-tured, and initial thoughts are that he ain\u2019t\ngonna be a one album guy.\nI was ushered into the backstage dressing\nroom for a chat, conducted in a rather jaunty side-by-side fashion since we were being\nfilmed. Turns out that Jeremy grew up in\nthe pleasant London suburb of Kingston. He\nbegan writing at the age of 16 on his own, a\nhabit he has stuck to (except recent collaborations with his keyboard player). He wasn\u2019t\nreally exposed to a scene, just schoolmates\nwith whom he formed the odd, and not very\ngood, band. The experience of being in go-ing-nowhere bands, and the freedom of\nnot having to make compromises kept him\nfocused on solo work. He had a quite brilliant club night called Jeremy Sings the Hits\nwhere he would do covers of songs by Bob\nMarley, At the Drive-In and the Smiths.\nAll his composition is now done with your\nstandard bedroom gear and an acoustic guitar for the very cool Transgressive Records.\nJeremy doesn\u2019t stick to a set compositional\nstyle, little scraps of lyrics build with little scraps of melody and then are thrown\ntogether to make something beautiful. He\nprides himself on never having written a\nlyric whose purpose he couldn\u2019t explain.\nYou should check out 5 Verses in particular,\nwhere quite a beautiful story is spun.\nI ask Jeremy whom he considers his musical peers and he clearly struggles, in the\nend deciding to say his music life is too self\ncontained to be thinking about others. He\nworries enough about losing inspiration,\nabout the day when the first two barren\nhours in the studio turn into a barren day,\na barren year etc. Perhaps he finds comfort\nin his supportive fan base, built up on the in-ternet, using forums such as MySpace and a\nblog. He likes to demystify the concept of a\nmusician up on a stage by familiarising with\npeople, and admires Lilly Allen for her very\nhuman blogs (though he is seemingly unaware of the hideousness of her music). Plus\na blog gives him something to do when he\u2019s\noff tour!\nAnd it has been quite a tour, starting in the\nsummer with festivals, supporting various\nbands through September (such as the Mystery Jets), and culminating with his headline\ntour, of which tonight is his last night. Now\nhe will head back into the studio do some\nremixes of a Larrakin Love song, and a Tilly\nand the Wall song. Busy times ahead for this\nimaginative young man, it\u2019s certainly worth\ngoing to the link below.\nJeremy\u2019s new single \u201cI believe in the way\nyou move\u201d is out on December the 18th\nand his debut album \u201cThe Art of Friction\u201d\nis out now\nwww.myspace.com/jeremywarmsley\nB\nrighton knocks out band after\nband with ease. There is a good\nchance though that you only know\na few of them. You may know the\nlikes of The Eighties Matchbox BLine Disaster \u2013 who are apparently still going \u2013 and the naughty things they want to do\nto your mum. There is also Electric Soft Parade who are now releasing records through\nTruck Records. On the female front, there is\nElectrelane who had albums recorded by\nSteve Albini (he recorded Nirvana\u2019s In Utero\nand The Pixies\u2019 Surfer Rosa). Along with\nthese better known bands, there was also\nanother great group called Cat On Form\n(2001-2004). This short-lived band were\nyoung, energetic and frankly what everyone needed at that time. They have since\nproduced many off-shoots and here is one\nof them, Blood Red Shoes.\nBlood Red Shoes could exceed the popularity and brilliance of Cat On Form, but\nto compare them to their old bands is besides the point \u2013 especially considering\nthat of the two of Blood Red Shoes only\none has been in the aforementioned. This\nduo \u2013 Laura-Mary Carter, guitar and vocals and Steve Ansell, drums and also vocals \u2013 make music that is simultaneously\nmelodic, raw and accessible. By their own\nadmission they say that, \u201cWe don't tend to\nsit on straightforward structures or ways\nto play our instruments because we'd get\nbored and we don't want to make cheap-shit predictable music.\u201d\nThey also have an impressive work\nethic; I saw them play three times in what\nmust have been a month-and-a-half, and\nmostly unintentionally. They say, \u201cWe've\nnotched up about 120 live shows and 4\nsingles. We reckon we've worked pretty\nhard.\u201d I\u2019d agree with them and they\u2019re determined to not rest on the laurels of their\nformer bands.\nIt is also a well-meaning determination\nwhen they say, \u201cWe want to move people;\nmake them dance or shout or get excited,\nand we don't want to come off like rock\nstars or some amazing otherworldy beings!\u201d Otherwordly? Never, when they\nmake this world so much fun.\nTheir latest single, \u201cYou Bring Me Down\u201d\nout now\nwww.myspace.com/bloodredshoes\nDARKDAZE\nANNA HALL\nBlood Red Shoes: Laura-Mary Carter (left) and Steve Ansell (right)\nand below; Jeremy Warmsley (far-left)\n\n"

Yet again, she\u2019s managed to sneak onto the back page. Beat her with sticks!\nCharlotte Atteck\nWith the team still being finalised\nat 2am on Sunday, it was a Christmas miracle that we managed to\nget 9 players out 10 hours later for\nour second match of the season\nagainst GKT 4th. With a few people\na little the worse for wear (Clarkey)\nwe found our way to Oval in time\nfor Sammy to take everyone on a\nbird squawking warm-up (running\naround like birds, obviously) to try\nand intimidate the opposition, who\noutnumbered us, 13 (including the\nshockingly biased umpires) to 9.\nThe game started with RSM having the clear upper hand as far as\nskill went, with the forwards making some good runs to goal. The\nshite umpiring standard became\nclear as GKT struck a ball clearly\noutside the D and were awarded\na goal which was later retracted\nas the umpires were swarmed by\nRSM complaints, including my\npersonal favourite from Alice R:\n\u201cExcuse me ref, not to be rude, but\nSammy is a pretty good goalkeeper\nand she wouldn\u2019t have left it if it was\ninside the D.\u201d Hell yeah! You had to\nbe there.\nThe game continued, with some\nexcellent runs from everyone; special mentions to Dasha and Lucy\nwho were later awarded joint man\nof the match for their skilful runs,\ntaking out 3 or 4 players from the\nopposition each time; legends. We\nmanaged to get some more short\ncorners and although we did use\nthe infallible \u201c426\u201d game plan,\nthe most we achieved was almost\nbreaking a defender\u2019s ankle. Was\nthat the same girl Ka\u2019ie hit in the\nback of the knees with her stick in\na way that would have made a Ben\nGates tackle look almost legal?\nHmm, maybe.\nDespiteourefforts,GKTmanaged\nto score in the second half after the\nreferees decided that because GKT\ncouldn\u2019t stop Welshy\u2019s 16s they were\ngoing to call her up for \u201cdangerous\nplay\u201d. Another fine example of the\ntalented refs, who also allowed GKT\nshorts to be injected with a hit, despite Spammy charging out of the\ngoal and informing the girl that this\nwas illegal about an inch away from\nher face. She looked like she was on\nthe verge of tears.\nAfter the RSM were told to \u201ccalm\ndown\u201d by the opposition on many oc-casions, it was only a matter of time\nbefore the game drew to a close,\nleaving us with our first defeat of\nthe season, which is annoying because we would have destroyed\nthem if we had had a full team! Oh\nwell, shit happens; at least we got\na free lunch at the pub out of it,\ncourtesy of GKT.

    "content": "27\nfelix\nFriday 8 December 2006\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nE\nlectronic Arts has over\ntwenty-four years grown\nto be the largest third-party software publisher\nin the world, producing\nsome of the most recognisable titles\nin the industry: The Sims, Medal of\nHonor, Battlefield 2, and the FIFA\nseries to name but a few. However,\ndespite its apparent popularity, it\nhas achieved its position through\na series of hostile market practices\nand is now abusing its position for\nits own short-term success \u2013 possibly putting the future of the entire\nindustry in jeapordy.\nEA pursues an extremely aggressive policy of securing intellectual\nproperty rights to popular fran-chises. This often takes the form\nof exlcusive deals with sports governing bodies \u2013 for example, FIFA\nand the NFL or film studios \u2013 EA\nholds the rights to all Lord of the\nRings and Harry Potter films, but\nalso involves buying up smaller development studios purely for their\ntrademark games. Over the years\nEA has purchased Maxis (Sim City\nand The Sims), Westwood Studios\n(Command and Conquer series),\nand Origin (Ultima and Ultima Online), often disbanding the studios\nand leaving understaffed teams to\nproduce poor-quality sequels.\nThese sequels are the core of EA\u2019s\ncurrent business plan. So many of\nits franchises are based on household names that represent once-good games: The Sims, Need For\nSpeed, Ultima and Command and\nConquer have all been fantastic in\ntheir time, but are now burdened\nwith a slew of cheap follow-ups. The\nSims 2 is now accompanied by no\nless than nine add-on packs, and\nC&C: Generals pales in comparison both to its genre contemparies,\nsuch as Act of War: Direct Action,\nand even its predecessor in C&C:\nRed Alert 2. These sequels and\nadd-ons typically feature marginally improved graphics to keep up\nto date with the latest hardware,\nthe occasional new feature (al-though not generally fixes for bugs\nor exploits), and updated artwork\n\u2013 whether that be new furniture for\nThe Sims, or this season\u2019s team kits\nfor sports games.\nThe most crucial element of this\nis their ultimatum: When a yearly\nupdate is released, support is immediately pulled for the previous\nversion. Microsoft still release\nsecurity updates for previous versions of Windows, yet owners of\nEA\u2019s FIFA World Cup 2006 will not\nbe seeing any updates now that\nFIFA 2007 is out \u2013 even though it\nwas released only six months ago.\nAdditionally, multiplayer game\nservers are switched off, disabling\nwhat for many is the best part of\na game, and these combined effectively forces people to upgrade\nevery single year.\nEven Battlefield 2, with its admittedly fantastic ranking system,\nfaces discontinuation in the face of\nBattlefield 2142 \u2013 despite the fact\nthat it has retained most of its play-erbase due to its contemporary setting and realistic gameplay.\nEA\u2019s most recent \u201ccrime\u201d involves\nthe Xbox 360 Marketplace. On older\nconsoles, and on the PC, extra features in games are unlocked by\neither completing objectives or entering cheat codes. However, on the\nXbox 360, players are forced to pay\nsmall amounts (\u00a31-2) for each fea-ture, leading many to accuse EA of\nselling incomplete games, almost\nconning people into handing over\nfar more than their original \u00a340.\nSo how does Electronic Arts get\naway with this? The answer to this\nis simple: Their exclusive licences\ngive them a dominance of so many\nareas of gaming, effectively giving them a monopoly in individual\ngenres. Games based on Harry\nPotter or The Lord of the Rings\nare practically guaranteed to sell,\nregardless of review scores or the\nWith the Wii now on the shelves,\nthe release schedules are erupting with quality launch titles that\nwere held back, as well as the\ndregs of the Christmas launch\nwindow. The Wii hits the UK with\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight\nPrincess, Red Steel, Wii Sports,\nand Wii Play all finding their way,\nif all goes to plan, to the EU region\nfor launch.\nZelda has been described as \u201cby\nfar the best Zelda made\u201d, and despite the revised control system,\nis still going to be a key release\ngame for the Wii. If you\u2019ve liked\nit in the past \u2013 even if you haven\u2019t\nliked it in the past \u2013 the new Zelda\nis worth a look.\nRed Steel, however, gained almost as much press coverage as\nTwilight Princess after it released\nenough press statements and explained just how its control system would work. By controlling a\ngun or a katana with the Wiimote/\nNunchuk system, you\u2019re given an\nunprecedented control over what\nyou can do.\nBut like all Wii titles, don\u2019t expect to start busting moves like\nKill Bill on a sugar rush \u2013 you\u2019ll\nneed to get used to the new control system before you can start\ndisarming enemies instead of lopping bits off them.\nYou\u2019ll find Wii Sports bundled\nwith the console itself, and if you\nbuy Wii Play at release you should\nget a second Wiimote with it, making the entire package far more\nmultiplayer-friendly for the festive\nseason.\nSports and Play are the best\nway to show off what the Wii can\ncurrently do \u2013 Zelda is a solid\nadventure, and Red Steel has a\ngreat visual appeal, but for sheer\nvariety and colourful Nintendo\ninventiveness, the Wii range of titles are probably the games to be\nlooking for first and foremost this\nChristmas.\nIf you\u2019re not a Wii player, then\nthere\u2019s still other games being re-leased, but you might find that the\nbest are long released. Captain\nScarlet for the PS2? Ghost Recon\nfor the 360?\nIt\u2019s the dregs. Like that cheap\nChristmas chocolate you find in\na Disney advent calendar, you\u2019re\ninto Christmas now whether you\nlike it or not. Best to save for the\nnew year.\nUnreal Tournament 2007\u2019s com-ing, after all \u2026\nOut now\nHold it! Objection, m\u2019lud!\nElectronic Arts don\u2019t deserve sympathy nor money, explains James Freedman\nJames Freedman, at the weekend. If only all journalism was this fun\nactual quality of the game. Their\npragmatic mindset prompts them\nto save money by not bothering to\ndevelop a high-quality game \u2013 to\nthem, it is simply the numbers that\nmatter. Many of their games sell on\nthe success of predecessors \u2013 Command and Conquer, for example,\nand many prey on the ultimate of\nall salespersons \u2013 the screaming\nchild. Every add-on for The Sims,\nis of course, a must have for every\nyoung fan, regardless of their minimal addition to gameplay. EA have\nalso been known to stifle user-gen-erated content \u2013 particularly in the\ncase of Battlefield 2 \u2013 perhaps in the\nbelief that (contrary to the obvious\nsuccess of Half-Life\u2019s modifiability\nwith Counter-Strike) the scarcity of\nadditional replayability provided by\nthis will increase the sales of their\nrushed add-ons and sequels.\nAt the end of the day, Electronic\nArts can get away with all this because the gaming community is,\nin general, fickle. Most potential\ncustomers will be swayed by a few\nstunning screenshots and the latest season\u2019s player stats, and this\nrenders the hardcore community\u2019s\nonly real option \u2013 voting by wallet\n\u2013 powerless.\nEven those who would like to take\na stand will find themselves grudg-inly purchasing the latest game\nin a franchise \u2013 after all, it may be\nshoddy, but it is apparently better\nthan the nothing EA are offering as\nan alternative.\nExhibits D-F : Battlefield 2, EA Sports, and online support\nWhen you buy a game, you\u2019re told\nin almost every way possible that\nyou\u2019re bound by legal and moral\nobligations to play the game once\na day, every day, alone, where noone else can so much as hear it,\nand not to tell anyone else you own\nthe game and god forbid you should\nlend the game to anyone without a\ncopy themselves.\nOf course, when it comes to what\nyou can expect, they couldn\u2019t give\na toss. Electronic Arts launch a\ngame, make claims as to\nwhat they\u2019re going to do\nin the future, and then\nsometimes do them.\nIn the past, it didn\u2019t\nmatter all that much\nif EA forgot about the\ngame. You missed\nout on a patch, or an\nexpansion pack you\ndidn\u2019t want anyway.\nBut when most of the\ngame\u2019s draw is an online\nmode, and when you\u2019re\nplaying on a console that\ncompletely relies on\nEA to keep the service going, it hardly\nseems fair that the\nones profiting from\nyou purchasing\ngames are also the\nones with the button\nthat switches off the\nvery thing you bought the\ngame for in the first place.\nRed Steel - Pow! Zap! Kaching!\nIt\u2019s been a long time coming.\nIt is, of course. It\u2019s plastered all\nover the EULA - you remember, it\u2019s\nthe thing you scroll down very fast\nwhilst chuckling during installation\nor, if you\u2019re a console gamer, the\nlines of text that flash on the screen\nfor a fraction of a second before\nstartup.\nBut legal documents don\u2019t excuse what is, essentially, wringing\nmoney out of gamers for something\nthey\u2019ve already bought countless\ntimes before.\nEA generic sporting franchise No. 49802819274.3, now with copiously pouring sweat glands\n\n"

Of\ncourse it\u2019s imflammatory and offensive to those that don\u2019t share his\nviews, but that isn\u2019t the point. The\npoint is that, in this country, everyone has a right to free speech unless they use their speech to incite\nviolence or hatred of a particular\ngroup or person. He didn\u2019t do this.\nAnd to you, Mr Dingle, the\nnumber of people that revere a given person has absolutely no effect\non what you should be able to say\nabout that person.\nIf we were to censor people on the\ngrounds that their views were offensive to others, we\u2019d be heading\ndown a dark path. To paraphrase\nan oft-used maxim: you may not\nagree with what Mr Lynas said,\nbut you should accept his right to\nsay it.\nDear Sir,\nThis is mind boggling. Every time\nI open Felix, or any other newspaper for that matter, there are numerous articles on Muslims that\navoid the most important questions such as why Muslims are the\nmost underprivileged and poverty-stricken segment of British society,\nor why Muslims are the least likely\nto be given the best opportunities.\nThese are important questions that\nsociety needs to address to itself if\nit truly believes in equal opportunities and values tolerance.\nInstead, the focus is incessantly\non stale arguments about banning\ntheveil;cartoons;orthePope. Okay,\nfair enough, in these cases freedom\nspeech or multiculturalism may\nbe identified as the core issue, but\nwhen I look at the \u201cargument about\nIslam that\u2019s been raging\u201d within Felix (as referred to by Andy Sykes),\nI can actually see no argument on\nIslam! I only see arguments on his-tory, or wide-sweeping statements\non Islam with no basis.\nMr Frison for example makes\ncompetent discussion about interpreting history, but doesn\u2019t give any\nvalid sources for his claims. Moreover, I fail to see how he jumps to the\nconclusion that Saad is \u201ca warmon-gering, completely biased\u201d, \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cimmoral\u201d Muslim\njust because he has presented his\nopinion using well-defined Western\nand European sources!\nHowever, I don\u2019t understand Mr\nLynas\u2019 response at all! While the\ntwo letters addressed to him had\nsubstance to them, and even though\nthe editor breached the writers\u2019\ntrust by providing Mr Lynas the letters outside the paper more than\na week before this response was\nproduced, Mr Lynas has only managed to come back with what could\nbe at best described as incoherent\nramblings of a racist or at worst\nhysterical propaganda. Therefore,\nMr Lynas, please go back to GCSE\nEnglish and learn how to construct\nan argument before you masquerade yourself as a saviour of the ill-informed, when in fact you yourself\nare the most ill-informed, and are\nA response to\nlast week\u2019s\neditorial\nnot willing to learn anything about\nthat which you wish to defame.\nIt most certainly doesn\u2019t help\nwhen Felix, which is meant to be a\nresponsible newspaper, simultaneously reports an absurd 6 year old\nrumour from a non-Imperial source\nabout an \u2018Imperial Islamic death\nsquad\u2019 as fact \u2013 as if such a thing\ncould actually exist. Or even when\nit reports an honest attempt at defending civil rights through the\nperfectly conventional Union Council route as being \u201cunder controversial circumstances and allegations\nof intimidation\u201d without giving any\nevidence to support its claim. I am\nof course referring to the report\nin the last issue about the Union\u2019s\ndecision to support the innocent\nBabar Ahmed\u2019s appeal to extradition to a brutal and inhumane US\nregime.\nSo, in summary, it is evident\nthat you Mr. Sykes are proud to be\n\u2018wielding the mighty organ\u2019, but\nplease do not get so carried away\nwith being fashionably politically\nincorrect that you are incorrect al-together. Hence, please appreciate\nyour huge responsibility and please\ngive us something meaningful and\ntruthful to discuss.\nRegards,\nAmmar Waraich\nAndy Sykes replies,\nPolitically incorrect? Hmm. I\u2019ll\ndeal with that when I\u2019ve discussed\nsome of false assumptions you\u2019ve\nmade in your letter.\nFirstly, there have been a lot of\nreplies and counter-replies to Mr\nLynas\u2019 first article, refuting or supporting his points. I\u2019d call that an\nargument, and judging by the passions it has stirred up, I feel justified in referring to it as \u2018raging\u2019.\nSecondly, you make a woefully\nfalse assumption that I \u201cbreached\nthe writers\u2019 trust\u201d. This is simply\nnot the case. I have an obligation to\nensure that if I am to publish a letter attacking an individual, I allow\nthat individual right of reply, as\nlaid down in the Press Complaints\nCommission\u2019s Code of Practice\nas well as Felix\u2019s constitution. I\ngave Mr Lynas right to reply, and\nshowed him the content of the letters discussing him.\nThirdly, the \u201cImperial Islamic\ndeath squad\u201d statement was so\nridiculous I felt that any astute\nreader would also find it ridicu-lous. The comment was prompted\nnot by, as you put it, a six year old\nsource, but by Imam Musa Admani on Newnight a few weeks ago.\nHe did not use the term \u201cIslamic\ndeath squad\u201d; what he did relate\nwas a story whereby a student approached him, and said: \u201cImam, I\ncame to inform you of something ...\na group from Imperial College are\ncoming to kill you tomorrow.\u201d\nFourthly, while I absolutely support the attempt by Colin Smith\n\n"

This first term has\nbeen an absolute nightmare in Felix, with computers breaking, steam pipes leaking into the office,\nprinting mishaps, and one memorable occasion\nwhere we were nearly six hours over deadline,\nand I was on the tellingphone begging the printers for\njust ten more minutes (oy, vay).\nOh well. I won\u2019t whinge about it any more. I\u2019m just glad\nthat this is the last issue of term, and I can go back to,\nlike, having a life, eating, and occasionally sleeping.\nI\u2019ll take this opportunity to say: if you\u2019re not happy with\nFelix, then find me and tell me. You can email me at fe-lix@imperial.ac.uk, or you can find me in the Felix office\nmost hours of the day or night. I will try to reply to every\nemail I receive personally. At the end of the day, I am\nonly the caretaker of Felix; I make sure it gets put out,\ngets advertising, and looks acceptable. I can\u2019t write eve-rything, so if you want something to appear in the paper,\nor you want to be part of it, then let me know and I\u2019ll do\nmy best to try and sort it out. I have no way of judging\nhow successful I\u2019m being \u2013 if I don\u2019t get any overt com-plaints, I assume that you\u2019re happy.\nI\u2019ll not comment on the Islam stuff on these pages -see the Letters page for my responses. Take them all\nwith a pinch of salt. You should read Stephen\u2019s editorial\nto the right of my big dumb head for a measured plea\nfor peace.\nI like Christmas, even though I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the\nbirthday of some bearded guy who was nailed to a tree\n2000 years ago for saying how nice it would be to be nice\nto one another for a change. It\u2019s all about wrapping up\nagainst the cold, shitty weather, and the fact that when\nthe rain is coming down horizontally in London you feel\nlike you\u2019re in a film. Oh, and drinking with your relatives.\nMy Grandma, bless her heart, becomes completely bonkers after she\u2019s tipped a couple of glasses of wine down\nher neck at the Christmas dinner table. She\u2019ll always\ntrot out some memorable phrase we\u2019ll all chuckle about\nfor the next 12 months; for example, she once annouced\nto the room: \u201cAndrew, you used to be such an ugly looking boy, but you came out alright in the end.\u201d She\u2019ll also\nask horribly personal questions about my love life, and\nnow she\u2019s started doing it to my sister as well. There\u2019s\nnothing more embarrassing that being quizzed on your\nrecent sexual conquests by a drunk 80-something year\nold lady you\u2019re related to. Ah, how I love her, and I mean\nthat honestly.\nThis editorial was brought to you by a very nice bottle\nof vodka that myself and a good friend consumed. Thank\nyou, sir, for you are a gentleman. I\u2019ll leave you with news\nthat as I write, a tornado has touched down in London\nabout five minutes walk from where I live, but I\u2019m at\nwork instead. I guess God missed. Hah!\nEnough is enough now!\nA plea from our exasperated Comment Editor about recent issues\nI am a member of a minority viewed\nwith suspicion by many and feared by\nsome. Being Irish, it has been some\nyears since I was last considered to be\nfrom a background conducive to ter-rorism, ever since the IRA were superceded by Al Qaeda as the main terrorist threat against Britain, but recently\nI have become one of the bearded of\nsociety. Pogonophobia - the fear of, dislike of or aversion to beards - is more\nprevalent in western society than ever\nbefore. After all, three of America\u2019s\nmost hated people are bearded - Fidel\nCastro, Osama Bin Laden and, after his\nspell hiding out from US troops, Saddam\nHussein are probably the most famous\nbearded men of recent times. As such,\nI find myself viewed with considerably\nmore suspicion than I was as a clean-shaven gentleman - on boarding planes\nI am taken to one side to have my bag\nBeards and the beard prejudice\nHugh Mansfield\nsearched, and I find myself stared at,\noften with open hostility, wherever I go.\nThere is a religious precedent for\nsuch prejudice, alas - Isaac\u2019s sons Esau\nand Jacob were known for being very\ndistinct in this regard - Jacob noted\nthat \u201cmy brother Esau is an hairy man,\nbut I am a smooth man\u201d, characteristics upon which their tale hinges. As\nIsaac\u2019s sight fails him, Jacob tricks him\ninto giving a blessing meant for Esau by\ncovering the exposed parts of his hands\nand neck with goat skins in order to appear as hairy as his brother. And yet, it is\nthe deceiver, the smooth criminal, who\nis viewed favourably by God, who states\nin Malachi 1: 2-3; \u201cYet I loved Jacob, but\nEsau I hated, and made his mountains\na desolation, and gave his heritage to\nthe jackals of the wilderness.\u201d It seems,\nthen, to be a mistake to depict Him as a\nbearded old man, given his disdain for\nthe bearded Esau, but it is heartening\nto observe that artists throughout the\nages have not been quite so prejudiced\nagainst the hirsute.\nMore notably, in popular culture a\ncharacter having a beard is often used\nas shorthand for \u2018this chap isn\u2019t to be\ntrusted\u2019, and nefarious types are signposted in this manner all too often rather than giving them believable motivations or character flaws. For example,\nFu Manchu is often portrayed as having\na long, thin beard (though, I am prepared to admit, mistakenly so, since the\ncharacter as written has no such thing)\nand The Master, Doctor Who\u2019s arch-nemesis, invariably sports a goatee, no\nmatter how many times he regener-ates. And in both popular culture and\nreal life, bearded women are almost invariably regarded as grotesques.\nPerhaps the most compelling example of pogonophobia is that of Richard\nNixon who, in the first televised debate\nin the leadup to the 1960 US presidential election, wore no makeup to hide his\nstubble and was consequently viewed\nas sinister and untrustworthy by the\nviewing public, despite those listening\non the radio generally agreeing that his\nperformance was the more compelling.\nThough this prejudice, whilst deeply\nhurtful and upsetting in itself, simply\nisn\u2019t anywhere near as much of a cause\nfor concern as predudice on the grounds\nof skin colour or the like since I, and any\nother bearded man, have the option to\nremove it at any time. And in the case\nof those for whom wearing a beard is a\nreligious observance, those who would\nview with suspicion are more likely to\ndo so out of religious intolerance than\non merely cosmetic grounds, while\nsome will look on their beards in a more\nfavourable light than those like myself\nwhose reasons for wearing a beard are\nconsiderably closer to vanity than to\nfaith.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

This term has\nbeen and gone, and to be\nhonest, the editorial team\nof Felix are in need of a\nholiday. This is the last issue of term\nand it is an appropriate opportunity for\nFelix to close all correspondence on\nthe debate sparked by Samuel Lynas\n(issue 1364). It has now rumbled on for\nfour weeks and the majority of people\nare thoroughly sick of it so we will be\nlooking for entirely new topics for discussion in the new year.\nI\u2019ve learned a valuable lesson over\nthe past month that will be useful for\nmy next two terms in this position. I am\nnot going to accept any more articles\nthat attempt to make political points\nusing historical arguments. In case you\nhaven\u2019t noticed, two groups of students\nhave been involved in tittle-tattle, but\nthe main thrusts of their arguments\nhave been incredibly flawed as they\nhave both been cherry picking facts\nand statements to suit their views.\nThis sounds reasonable enough but it\nis a very dangerous way to present an\nargument. For example, lets go back to\nGSCE History for a minute, flick open\nour textbooks and notice that from the\nGreat Depression up until the start of\nWorld War II the German economy\nwent from being stagnant to one of the\nmost productive in the world. This was\nno mean feat, given the levels of poverty\nafter the Wall Street Crash. On the next\npage of the textbook, we notice that a\nMr. Adolf Hitler was leader of Germany\nfor most of this period and we decide to\ninfer on the basis of these economic figures that he did an absolutely splendid\njob running Germany. Never mind the\nfact we\u2019ve ignored the establishment\nof a dictatorship, the persecution of the\nJews and the warmongering leading\nto the invasion of weaker neighbours.\nWe have now constructed a perfectly\nviable, factually correct argument that\nrepresents a massive distortion of what\nwas actually happening in Germany at\nthat time. Arguing using this method is\njust plain bonkers.\nAs for some of the intemperate, highly\nemotive, even bigoted language aimed\nat Muslims over the past few weeks I\nfound it very offensive. We hummed\nand hawed before eventually deciding\nto print them on the grounds that whilst\nit was offensive, it was not threatening\nand that if a student was prepared to\nput their name alongside it then they\nwere entitled to have their views aired.\nIf people do harbour opinions that others find offensive then I believe its best\nthat everything is out in the open so we\nall know what and whom we are dealing with. I am in no way suggesting\nthat anything was deliberately written to cause offence just that if you are\nwriting you should be fully aware that\nin some cases the semantics can make\nall the difference and how people interpret your article may be different from\nhow you intend.\nOn the other hand I almost choked\nwhen I read the piece arguing that the\narrival of a Muslim army in Constantinople was \u201cmerciful.\u201d A Muslim army\ninvading a foreign country that was acknowledged to have fairly unpleasant\nrulers was \u201cmerciful?\u201d Oh, the irony.\nConquest is never going to be a black\nand white issue whereby it will be either\ntotally welcomed or totally opposed\nand it should not be presented as such.\nI have zero knowledge of this period of\nhistory, but I do know that good historians not only point out bias in the work\nof others but make every attempt to acknowledge their own motivations when\nwriting. None of the authors made any\nreal attempt to do this.\nAll of this started as a result of one\nperson\u2019s interpretation of an article\nthat appeared on the Union website but\nsoon escalated into a discussion about\na conflict thousands of years ago a long\nway from South Kensington. The problem with highly emotive topics such as\nwar and religion is that almost everyone has an opinion on them but few are\nqualified to make any real assertions.\nIt is a criticism that applies to every\nstudent newspaper in the country that\nyou open it up to be presented with the\nridiculous spectacle of 20-year olds\nclaiming that only if you listen to them\nthen we\u2019ll have world peace, a better\neconomy or an accurate interpretation\nof a medieval war. I am aware that it is\nnot possible to totally divorce matters\nthat directly affect us students from\nthe wider world and it is admirable\nthat there are so many people who take\nan interest. Youthful idealism is a fine\nthing but we should always think carefully before we open our mouths in a\npublic forum. I feel very strongly on a\nvariety of topics and if I really wanted\nto I could use my weekly editorial as\na soapbox for my political views but I\ndon\u2019t believe that Felix is an appropriate platform for my opinions on, for ex-ample, American Politics. The reason I\ndon\u2019t is that I realise I will have nothing\nnew to add to the debate. All my opinions are formed on the basis of what I\nhave seen on TV or read in the national\npress. My regurgitation of these facts\nand what I infer from them is hardly going to make interesting reading.\nOk, rant over. See you all in 2007. If\nanyone feels bored over the holidays\nget writing, but leave ancient history to\nthe historians.\n7\nfelix\nFriday 8 December 2006\nCOMMENT & OPINION comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
