Whilst this is\nall good and well, it is impossible to\nspend every waking hour working,\nand one must take some time off in\norder to clear the head, ready to take\nin more knowledge. I thus propose a\nnice relaxing sport within a 2 minute\nwalk of most departments and not\ntoo physically exerting. No, I\u2019m not\ntalking about Curling, Croquet on the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn is THE sport of this\nsummer!\nMany of you have seen or heard of\nCroquet in some shape or form \u2013\nthe images of Alice in Wonderland,\ncucumber sandwiches and toffs playing in back gardens of giant country\nestates spring to mind. However, cast\nthat all aside for a moment and consider a new, streamlined version of\nCroquet complete with daring play,\nplenty of skill and lots of fun. Although\nCroquet has an image of being a\ngame for retired and semi-retired,\nit has made a storming come-back\namongst the younger generation. The\nphysical skills and tactics are easier\nfor young people to pick up, and one\ncan reach a high standard of play\nafter just 3 months.\nModern Croquet combines skill and\ntactics \u2013 on a lawn which is 35 by 28\nyards (32 x 25 metres), and where the\nhoops are just 3 millimetres wider\nthan the balls which go through them,\none needs a bit more than luck to\nplay the game well! There are two\ntypes of Croquet which are popular in\nEngland, we play both of them:\nGolf Croquet is more synonymous\nwith the \u2018vicious\u2019 image of \u2018back garden croquet\u2019 (the croquet of country\nCroquet\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIs croquet the new cricket?\nCroquet Club member Tom Tibbits in play\nEugene Chang\nretreats), and one simply has to score\n7 of the 13 hoop points on offer to\nwin.\nAssociation Croquet, the main variant of the game, is similar to snooker\n\u2013 one has to create \u2018break\u2019s in order\nto achieve the objective of getting\nboth your balls through all the requisite 12 hoops and to hit the peg (post)\nbefore your opponent. It has drawn\nlinks with chess as well, for the high\nlevel of tactics and psychology behind\nthe game. It is ideally suited to people\nwho understand lines and angles -many of the top players in the current\ncroquet world have a strong science\nbackground; in fact, Bernard Neal,\nthe current president of the Croquet\nAssociation (the governing body of\nCroquet in UK) was head of the civil\nengineering department here a few\nyears back!\nImperial sent a team to the National\nStudent Championships at Oxford in\nJune 2005, where we reached the\nsemi-finals of the team competition,\nand yours truly beat off some strong\nopposition to finish 2nd in the individual category (so apparently I\u2019m\nthe 2nd best student croquet player\nin the UK ??); the Nottingham Uni\nstudent who won it got to the last 8\nof the World Championships later\nthat summer. So all-in-all, Imperial\nconsolidated our position as one of\nthe best student croquet clubs in the\ncountry. We plan to take an invigorated team back to Oxford this coming\nJune to stage an upset on holders and\nlocal favourites Oxford Uni!\nIf you are interested in Croquet in any\nshape or form, be it for amusement,\nrelaxation, or you want to compete in\nthe Imperial Croquet team, contact\ncroquet@ic.ac.uk, or simply come\nand find us on the Queen\u2019s Lawn\nwhen we are there. Meeting times\nare on Wednesday afternoons and\nseveral lunchtimes a week depending\non availability. We are looking to hold\na croquet tournament open to all students and staff this term \u2013 keep your\neyes peeled for more details!\nOn Sunday 5th March 2006, Hyde\nPark hosted the first ever Marrow\nFun Run, in aid of the Anthony Nolan\nTrust. This is an international organisation that keeps a registry of bone\nmarrow donors who can potentially help cure sufferers of fatal blood\ndisorders, such as leukaemia. The\nrun had aimed to attract 500 runners to run either 8km or 3km races.\nEntering the run couldn\u2019t have been\neasier \u2013 pick up an entry form prior\nto the event, sign up online or simply\nregister on the day.\nAs the members of the Marrow\ncommittee gathered at Hyde Park\ncorner in the morning, there was\na tense feeling. The Piccadilly Line\nthrough Hyde Park Corner had been\npart suspended that morning, making\nit extremely difficult for the runners\nto arrive in time for the 11 o\u2019clock\nstart. Then, there was the freezing\ncold, windy conditions, which could\neasily have kept all the runners in\nbed. One hour before the scheduled\nstart, the volunteer marshals had\nmarked out the courses for both distances and the St Johns first aid tent\nwas in place. However, there were\nno runners to be seen \u2013 it looked like\nthe planned start would have to be\npushed back.\nSlowly, the participants arrived at\nthe start line to register their names\nand pick up their running T-shirts.\nBefore long, Hyde Park corner was\nfilled with bustling runners and their\nsupporters \u2013 including young chil-dren, the elderly, sports teams and\nfitness fanatics, college professors\nand regular people trying to get a bit\nfitter. Even the Marrow superheroes\n\u2013 Bone Boy and Marrow Dog were\nspotted going through their pre-run\nstretches!!\nThe event eventually kicked off at\n11.30, with an amazing 536 registered\nrunners. The 3km run started first,\nshortly followed by the 8km event.\nWhether walking or running, the participants seemed to be really enjoying\nthemselves despite the cold.\n\u201cWe hope to see\nyou again next\nyear\u201d\nAs runners crossed the finish line,\nthey collected a fun run goodie bag,\na much needed drink and their cer-tificates. A special mention must be\nmade to the winners. Pierre Gaudin\nwon the 3km men\u2019s event with a\ncracking time of 11 minutes and 40\nseconds. The aptly named Deborah\nSpeed won the woman\u2019s 3km with a\ntime of 16 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIn the 8km run, the men\u2019s winner\nwas William Burrard-Lucas with a\nfantastic time of 30 minutes and 10\nseconds and the woman\u2019s winner was\nAngharad Care with a super speedy\ntime of 30 minutes and 20 seconds.\nAnother highlight was the performance of Bone Boy who came in last in\nthe 8km run.\nMarrow Fun Run 2006, eventually proved to be a massive success,\nraising an incredible \u00a310,000 for the\nAnthony Nolan Trust and providing\na relaxed and fun day out. A huge\nthank you must be made to the following people: Matthew Butler (fun\nrun organiser), Gokulan Phoenix\n(Marrow President), all the volunteers who helped with the smooth\nrunning of the event. Most impor-tantly, Marrow would like to give a\nmassive thanks to the runners \u2013 the\nmoney you raised was unbelievable\nand we hope you enjoyed yourselves.\nWe hope to see you again next year,\nalong with many more fun runners.\nMarrow Fun Run\nKumaran Shanmugarajah\nInaugural fun run huge\nsuccess for charity\nathletes\n1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 6 7 7 8\n8 9\n9 10\n10 11 12\n11 12\n13 14 15 16 17\n13 14 15 16\n18 19 20 21\n17 18 19 20\n22 23 24 25\n21 22 23 24\n26 27 28 29 30\n25 26\n31 32\n27 28\nAcross\n8.

The week\nbefore that it was\nVanessa Walton.\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEngineers visit horpe Park\nThe UK\u2019s biggest amusement park\nattraction opened at Thorpe Park in\nMarch, just as term was ending. At\n205ft tall \u201cStealth\u201d certainly is big. It\nis Europe\u2019s tallest and fastest coaster\nand can be found at the Surrey-based\namusement park. It launches from\nstanding at the station to 80mph in\njust 2.3 seconds, before throwing you\nup and vertically down down over its\n205ft hump! The whole experience\nlasts just 20 seconds and 15 Imperial\nstudents got the chance to see the\ncomplex engineering from behind the\nscenes.\nAt 7am, they arrived at the somewhat deserted theme park to be met\nby their contact, who then took them\nto meet the head of engineering in\nthe maintenance sheds. Here, every\nmorning, the team of ride engineers\nwould go over every single nut and\nbolt of all three carts, ensuring nothing had gone astray the previous day.\nThe wheels would even be re-aligned\nto ensure a smooth ride. Indoor heating lamps warm the carts before they\nleave the sheds in order to ensure\nthat the lubricant on the wheels\nworks as it should. If it\u2019s under 5\ndegrees Celsius many of the rides\nwill not function. It was 6 degrees on\nthe day\u2026\nLeaving the shed, they passed the\nride\u2019s first passengers of the day:\nThe water dummies. Each dummy,\nweighing the same as a person, gets\na ride before real people get a chance\nto even queue. After the 20 second\nordeal, they were all intact. This was\ntaken to be a good sign.\nThe hardcore engineering lies\nunder the large hump, inside a\nbunker. It contains one very large,\nvery expensive motor; containing 42\nsmaller motors, to be precise. Oil and\nNitrogen are pumped-in constantly\nto store energy from the National\nGrid between ride launches (to stop\nStaines having blackouts every minute or so). This stored energy is then\nreleased causing a cable to be reeled\nwith an impressive force. This cable\nis attached to the cart via a catch-car shortly after everyone is secured\n(this is the bit of the ride when judder\nforward and back before you shoot\noff!). The force stored in the pipes\nin here could slice you in half if the\ncable buckled. Furthermore, if the\noil in the system leaked, the whole\nbunker would be filled in seconds.\nThis explains the rather secure door\nwhich is sealed before operation.\nThe tour was finished with a look\nat the launch track and the controls.\nEvery day, engineers run the catch\ncar at a snails pace along the 80m\nlaunch track feeling by hand any\nvibrations which indicate damage\nin the track. The control system is\nsimple to operate, but pretty complex\nin the background. In order to make\nsure you get over the top, the launch\nforce must automatically reconfigure\nitself based on the weight of people\nand weather conditions. Every 5\nruns averages are taken with the\nintent that the cart reaches the crest\nat 12m/s. If you balance at the top\n(this happened once on a similar ride\nin the US called Top Thrill Dragster.\nPeople were stuck for 35minutes at\n400 ft), there is a rope for a rescuer\nto climb to give you a nudge \u2013 but this\nshould never happen\u2026\nOnce the park opened, the students\ngot a chance to experience the ride\u2026\nAccording to one of the lucky guests:\n\u201dIt\u2019s awesome! It\u2019s very fast, very\nsmooth and you get a great view for\nthe second or so that you are at the\ntop.

Admittedly, she rarely plays anyone other than a ditzy,\nunlucky in love, socially inept and\ninsecure thirty going on forty year old\nwoman but I\u2019m fond of her. Earlier in\nthe year I came up with a list of dinner party guests and her quirkiness\nmakes her most certainly welcome.\nGreig first came to my attention\nwith Black Books, then the criminally unnoticed Love Soup and most\nrecently with the second series of\nGreen Wing which has been a hoot.\nThe fast-forward, slow-mo direction has earned Green Wing most of\nits notoriety whilst at the same time\npolarising opinion. Set in a hospital,\nthe story follows various employees\nas they do very little doctoring and\nlittle much else. Whilst, personally,\nI find the direction enhances some\nof the comedy, for instance an invisible limbo stick is repeatedly ducked\nby office workers whilst the camera\nquickens and slows, it\u2019s the characters\u2019 variety that really succeeds.\nThe main\nplot follows Dr.\nCaroline Todd,\nplayed by Greig\nand it concerns\na more conventional \u2018hard to\nget\u2019 romance.\nInternet caption winning\nc o n s u l t a n t\nr a d i o l o g i s t ,\nAlan Statham is perhaps the most recognisable character; a bumbling, per-verted, stammering fool disliked by\nmost of the department for arrogantly\ntalking convoluted and windy bullshit.\nHighlights include adlibbed verbal\ntennis with junior doctor Boyce and\nan incredibly immature rendition of\nthe alphabet in a Chinese restaurant.\nThe best one-liners though are saved\nfor everyone\u2019s favourite evil bastard,\nDr. Guy Secretan.

PG)\nHIIII\nDVD Review\nLast week\u2019s TV...\nIndifference is rarely an opinion\nabout cult films. Those who wear the\nrobes and hoods worship their iconic\nfilm and then there are non believers\nwho loathe it usually on the basis of\nart house cinema being pretentious\nnonsense. For this reviewer, a swift\ndrive through the cobbled streets\nof Paris should be kept to Clarkson\nand company, not a woefully thrown\ntogether DVD.\n1976 short film C\u2019etait Un\nRendezvous begins with a car roaring out of a tunnel in the French\ncapital. Speedily, the car growls past\nother vehicles, zooms down one-way\nstreets and disperses pigeon gatherings instantly. The action is filmed\nin one long shot with the camera\nseemingly attached to the bumper of\nthe car. Consequently, our chauffeur\non this nightmare journey remains\nentirely anonymous, only glimpsed\nbriefly when he steps out of the car\nand embraces a young blonde woman\nat the end of his lap. That\u2019s it, film\nover. Shorter than the stubby fingers\nof a London cabbie and costs more\nmoney than you care to place into his\ngreasy palms.\nAdmittedly the ending is subtly\nunexpected. Contemporary television adverts bombard you with tragic\nclimaxes resulting from the intoxication of an idiot having a \u2018great night\nout\u2019, but then Rendezvous was never\ngoing to finish with a pile up considering this was reality and the mysterious driver might have been the film\u2019s\ndirector. Cult status was attained by\nthe shroud that surrounds the short\nfilm. Director Claude Lelouch has\nremained tight lipped about the film.\nWas it a Formula 1 driver? Was the car\na Ferrari or Mercedes? Was Lelouch\narrested for making the film? The\ngreatest mystery of all though is:\nWhat was the point?\nRendezvous has managed to\nbecome the petrolheads\u2019 Holy Grail.\nForty year old men coping with a\nmid-life crisis, finish washing their\nCitroen \u201cOh, it\u2019s convenient for the\nkids, darling\u201d Picasso before removing their anoraks, stepping indoors\nand kneeling down for another viewing of Rendezvous to glimpse the\ndivine driver wishing they were that\n\u2018gnarly\u2019.\nFrom cellophane wrapper to being\nback in the case, all the DVD\u2019s content is exhausted (pun absolutely\nintended) within a fraction of the time\nit would take you to watch an episode\nof Cops or Police Camera Action!\nA single short film packaged onto\na full price DVD is cheeky enough.\nAccompanying the main feature with\nfour pages of text and three trailers\nwhere the logos zoom in Microsoft\nPowerpoint style reeks of \u2018cash-in\u2019\ngreater than super efficient Castrol\nGTX.\nTomo Roberts\nNot forgetting his best line of all,\n\u201cMy balls look best on your chin\u201d.

Classic stuff and\nthe best comedy since Extras.\nMy last waffle\nfor the academic\nyear concerns\nThe Apprentice.\nOnce again I\nbecame fixated\nby the show\ntowards the end\nof the series. The\nfinal was last\nweek involving\nthe feisty, arrogant bitch Ruth and mildly pleasant\nMichelle. Sadly, my favourite, Ansell\nwas fired the previous week, so these\ntwo broads were left to duke it out.\nThe task: to each create a party on\nTower Bridge, with the help of previous contestants. That included Syed\nwho is probably the most self-cen-tred, na\u00efve and downright irritating\nperson on the planet.\nFor some unknown reason the contestants all seem really shit, at eve-rything. Constant arguments and an\narrogance that is so blinding you\nfail to see your own flaws, wouldn\u2019t\nmake a good employee in my book.\nYet somehow these people, many of\nwhom haven\u2019t obtained an A-Level,\nmanage to get through the selection processes and into the final ten.\nPerhaps it\u2019s down to the BBC to\nchoose who will argue with Alan the\nmost, or maybe anyone with any self-respect and intelligence doesn\u2019t actually enter the competition.\nUnfortunately I found out Michelle\nwas the winner before I\u2019d watched\nthe show, thanks to my inability to\ndivert my eyes from MSN\u2019s news\nhomepage. Sigh. Nevertheless, it was\na good show and thankfully Little Ms\nPiggy didn\u2019t win.\nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed my output\nthis year, but that\u2019s it from me. Lucky\nyou, being spared what would have\nbeen weeks of inevitable Big Brother\ncoverage!

    "content": "9\nfelix\nThursday 18 May 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\nNIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNo doubt you\u2019re feeling tired of revi-sion, feeling worried that you\u2019re not\ngoing to score 100% again this year,\nare bored of wanking and need some\nstress relief. Lucky for you, this is\na guide (for the boys) to clubs in\nLondon where you\u2019re guaranteed to\npull, giving you that much needed\nconfidence boost just before those\nexams.\nNow, considering you are most\nlikely at Imperial, you\u2019ve probably\ngot no chance of even having enough\ncourage to talk to a girl, much less\nof convincing her to let you put your\npenis inside her, so before the club\nguide begins, I\u2019ve been kind enough\nto include a list of what not to say or\ndo. (I can vouch for these; I\u2019ve seen\npeople trying it, and witnessed the\nresults). I\u2019m not kind enough to tell\nyou what you should do though, but\njust bare these few points in mind.\nRemember! You are not at Imperial\nCollege Union here, this is the big\nwide world you\u2019ve ventured out into,\nit\u2019s a scary and perilous place I know,\nbut don\u2019t worry. Just keep in mind\nthat nobody out here cares a tiny\nlittle bit about the structure of your\ndegree, nobody cares that you\u2019ve got\n9am tutorials on a Wednesday which\nmeans you have to get up just for\nthat instead of sleeping in, its boring.\nWhen someone asks you what you do,\nit\u2019s not an invitation to talk for 20 minutes about thermodynamics, maths\nor quantum mechanics and don\u2019t\nwhatever you do, mention that lame\nfact that \u201cThermodynamics Sucks\u201d it\njust never, ever works. Neither does\nclaiming that \u201cImperial is the second\nbest university in the country for\nComputer Studies\u201d in a surprised\nvoice, when they tell you that they\u2019ve\nnever heard of it. You might also want\nto consider waiting until the fifth or\nsixth date to mention that the Union\nhas the second biggest sci-fi library\nin the world after MIT, and definitely\ndon\u2019t ever mention your 180Gb porn\ncollection, and never, ever talk about\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFinally, if you are an IC rich kid,\ndon\u2019t tell everyone about it. Who\ncares what private school you went\nto, what exclusive gentleman\u2019s club\nyou\u2019ve joined this year, the companies\nyour daddy owns and which merchant bank you\u2019ve managed get an\ninternship with. It makes you look\nlike a prick when you talk about that,\n(I myself am a prick so I\u2019m told on\nnumerous occasions, but we\u2019re interested in you here, not me.) This isn\u2019t a\n\u2018networking opportunity\u2019, you\u2019re trying to get a shag, not secure a job\ninterview.\nNow with that in mind, if you follow\nthis guide completely you will have a\nnearly 100% chance of meeting that\ngirl of your dreams (the one that will\nallow you within 3 feet) and maybe if\nyou\u2019re very lucky, and if she\u2019s really\nwasted, you wont have to face that\nhorrible prospect of graduating as a\nvirgin. Don\u2019t get your hopes up too\nhigh though, we\u2019re going for cheap\nsluts here, there is no way that this\nguide will find you a nice girl.\nMonday\nMonday night is a hard one to start\nwith, sure there are some good clubs,\nbut that\u2019s not the aim here, we\u2019re\ntrying to get lucky tonight, not appreciate the DJ\u2019s or listen to music we\nactually like. Don\u2019t bother with Trash;\nthe last time someone pulled at that\nplace they were playing new tracks\nby The Smiths. Imperial students\nhave no chance here. Your best bet is\nheading off to The Roxy and grabbing\nyourself a 16 year old, and if that fails,\ngo up to a random, loose looking slut\nin Soho and ask her where a good\nplace is to go out on a Monday, you\u2019ll\nfind out what happens.\nTuesday\nThis is easy, and again we head off\nto The Roxy for our easy pull. Who\ncares if they look younger than your\nlittle sister, \u00a31.50 bottles of beer mean\nshe\u2019ll probably be so wasted she won\u2019t\nactually be able to focus on your butt\nugly face, just be sure to get in there\nquick before everyone else does. Be\naware this will probably be where\nyou\u2019ll find the most refined girls of\nthe week, indie kids tend to be pretty\nself conscious, so even if she\u2019s ugly\nat least she\u2019ll have some nice acces-sories.\nWednesday\nQuite obviously you have to make\nyour way over to Cheapskates, if you\ndon\u2019t know where it is, just start off\nin the union and follow all rugby toffs\nthere. This is probably the most guaranteed night you\u2019ll have of getting\nlucky, so if you can only tear yourself\nfrom your computer for one night of\nthe week, make it this one. If you prefer boys to girls, then Nag Nag Nag is\nyour place, just get tarted up..\nThursday\nLucky for us, Candybox, the second best club for getting an easy\nshag has moved from Wednesdays\nto Thursdays, it won\u2019t clash with\nCheapskates any more, allowing for\na mid-week double whammy. So head\non over there, get tanked up and find\nyourself a cheap tarted up minger\nwho won\u2019t give a dam that you\u2019ll only\nlast 5 minutes in bed as long as you\nbuy her vodka and mixers all night.\nIf that doesn\u2019t take your fancy, you\ncan always head off to Metro and find\nyourself another indie girl, maybe\nthe same one you found at The Roxy\non Tuesday, perfect.\nFriday\nNo doubt at this point you are feeling\na bit knackered, and if all is going\nwell you must have been lucky at\nleast once in the week, but don\u2019t\nlose momentum! Friday night is easy\npicking. If at the beginning of the\nweek your taste for underage indie\ngirls was whetted, then get your\nskinny arse over to club NME at\nKOKO, there\u2019s literally thousands of\nthem here, this is where they breed.\nBeing in Camden means when you\nget bored there, you can move on\nover to the Electric Ballroom; rock\nchicks and pseudo goths galore. Be\naware though, nu-metal girls can be\npretty freaky in bed, so just watch out\nif you\u2019re a bit feeble, or you\u2019ll wind up\nsomeone\u2019s bitch. Oh and make sure\nyou don\u2019t end up with the \u2018boobyprize\u2019 emokid, she may seem up for\nit in the club, but once you\u2019re back at\nhers she wont stop crying and reading you her poems.\nIf these still don\u2019t take your fancy,\nthen head on over to Ministry with\ncheap sluts ten-a-penny at their\nhip-hop night. Be warned though,\nElephant and Castle isn\u2019t South Ken,\nCalling all Imperial geeks\nso be prepared to get robbed or beaten up.\nSaturday\nHopefully this morning you\u2019ll be waking up in someone else\u2019s bed, so make\nsure you sneak away quietly, or make\nyour excuses and get the hell out of\nthere. There\u2019s a whole other night\nof fun and games ahead, so don\u2019t do\nanything stupid and geeky like falling\nin love. Get home and have a rest,\nplay some CS put on your Clearasil\nand get ready for another evening of\npasty hot geeky action.\nIf you don\u2019t fancy any more super\nclubs, then make your way over to\nBelushi\u2019s, formerly Prospects, this\nis the best place in Fulham to pick\nup a cheap Australian bird, and with\nsnakebites for only \u00a32 they are sure\nto be more trashed than you. What\u2019s\nmore they\u2019ll live near by so no need\nfor a long bus journey back, where\nshe runs the risk of noticing what you\nlook like.\nIf you are still in the mood for club-bing, then you could make your way\nover to Ministry again, crap House\ngalore, you\u2019re sure to find some willing bint. Just make sure if she\u2019s hugging you really hard, check that her\npupils aren\u2019t too huge, you don\u2019t want\nyour girl to crash by the time she gets\nhome, or she\u2019ll never agree to sex.\nSunday\nSunday: the day of rest. No doubt you\nwill be completely shagged out by\nnow if you\u2019ve followed the guide com-pletely, and you\u2019ll have absolutely no\nchance of passing those exams after\nspending a week partying and sleeping around. Luckily for you there isn\u2019t\nmuch around on a Sunday where you\ncan meet cheap sluts, so use this day\nas an opportunity to get back online\nand tell all your clan members what\nyou\u2019ve been up to this week, and book\nan appointment with the STD clinic.\nIf you\u2019ve followed this rundown of\nclubs religiously, then most likely\nyou\u2019ll have achieved your all time\ndream of pulling a girl. Now you can\nget back to revision, and after those\nexams, go and try it all over again.\nIf you still failed to pull by following\nthis, then you have absolutely no\nchance in hell. Give up now, you\u2019ll\nhave to make do with that online\nvirtual girlfriend, carry on using that\nporn collection you\u2019ve amassed, and\nget yourself a Blow Up Betty, she has\nvery lush lips.\nEchobastard\nSoon enough this will no longer be what you wake up beside.\nNeed a break from revision? Did you die on WoW? Tired of wanking?\nFear not, Felix Nightlife has prepared a London club guide just for you.\nDefinitely don\u2019t\never mention\nyour 180Gb porn\ncollection.\nGet home, have\na rest, play\nsome CS and\nput on your\nClearasil.\nYou\u2019re trying\nto get a shag,\nnot secure a job\ninterview.\nDo you like getting free entry to nightclubs? Free drinks and VIP\ntreatment? If yes, email nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk to contribute\n\n"

    "content": "6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 18 May 2006\nmusic\nmusic music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTools, iron, wine. An alcoholic blacksmith\u2019s dream.\nFelix\u2019s music section loves you.\nNot many acts can get away with sticking to the same formulae throughout\na career. While some take an almost\nschizophrenic/polarised approach to\nevery album, totally contradicting the\nlast (Madonna springs to mind), others like to develop and grow, urging\nthe listener to follow them into new\nground. Often this doesn't work, the\nband implodes and becomes a memory of a particular year, rather than\none of true musical inspiration. Then\nagain the occasional group do \u2018make\nit\u2019 and become iconic, genre defining,\nand much loved by even the most\nardent music critic.\nBut what about Tool? They do noth-ing. They arse around, play infrequent concerts, and write their website blog. When they get bored, once\nabout every half a decade, they whip\na new album out of their trousers,\nput it down on the table, and watch\nas hordes of disaffected American\nyouths gorge on the dark lyrics that\nMaynard spits down the microphone.\nDon't get me wrong, I love Tool. In\nfact, I managed to scoop a coveted\nticket to their two night residency\nat the Hammersmith Apollo; but as\nthey begin to average a 5 year hiatus\nbetween albums, you start to wonder\nif they are just a one trick pony, lazily\nrehashing a 14 year old sound when\ntheir bank balance gets low. 10,000\nDays is definitely a, 100%, no-doubt-about-it Tool album. It throbs like a\nheadache, occasionally exploding into\na full blown migraine of distortion and\nscreams: But it is not until track six,\nLipan Conjuring, that we actually\nhear something new. Something that\nreminds the listener of Henry Rollins\non Undertow (their second album).\nTwo tracks later, Rosetta Stoned\nreverts back to their run of the mill\nsound, containing a riff lifted straight\nfrom Lateralus with a few sampled\nvocals added to dupe the listener into\nthinking it is new.\nAfter listening to 10,000 Days it\nbecomes obvious that Tool aren't\nplanning on pushing the boundaries\nof music forward any more. Perhaps\nMaynard put too much into his side\nproject, A Perfect Circle; or perhaps\nit has just taken five studio albums\nfor them to loop back to the start.\nWhich ever it is Lateralus remains\nTools magnum opus and 10,000 Days\nis half the album it thinks it is. The\ncool Alex Gray artwork isn't going to\nsave you now boys.\nNick Simpson\nMetal with a sense of humour? Tool are now officially Megadeth.\nfor the night. After this engaging\naside, Calexico got on with their hour-and-quite-a-bit showcase. If you have\nheard the new stuff by them, you\nmight be disappointed, but their set\nwas well timed, paced, and packed\nfull of melodies and harmonising\ntrumpets. Yes, harmonising trum-pets! Along with a cover of Love\u2019s\nAlong Again Or (with trumpet fanfare in the chorus), Calexico were\nmore than entertaining and impor-tantly, they were different from Iron\nand Wine.\nALBUM REVIEW\nTool\n10,000 Days\n(Volcano Records)\nHHIII\nHyperbole goes hand in hand with\nthe music scene like poor personal\nhygiene goes with a physicist (the\nsmell in Blackett after a hot day would\nupset a skunk). Speaking of which,\nharsh personal opinions also occur\nin the music scene. Nonetheless, I\nam not mincing my words when I say\nthat out of the many shows I\u2019ve been\nto (enough to make me more than\nextremely cynical) Iron and Wine\nwith Calexico is perhaps the best and\nmost memorable. As I sit here writing\nwhilst watching Full Metal Jacket,\nthinking about that night fills me\nwith inner tranquillity set against the\nharsh martial tones on the telly in the\nbackground. It really was that good.\nFor those who are fans of either of\nsaid artists, you have no doubt picked\nup their magnificent collaboration\nrecord. If you haven\u2019t, I recommend\nyou do by the end of the day, otherwise whatever Supreme Being you\nbelieve in will never forgive you. It\nis a record of delightful harmonies,\nmelodies, and delicate vocals, with all\nthe power of the Kubrick classic (see\nabove). So after hearing their collaboration and finding out they were\nplaying together at the Kentish Town\nForum (the size of the Astoria, but\nwith brilliant sound and ambience) I\ncouldn\u2019t wait to go.\nThe best part about the gig is that I\nwas constantly guessing about what\nwas going to happen. I didn\u2019t know\nwhether they\u2019d play separate sets\nand then play a set together at the\nend or whether they\u2019d play together\nand have a couple of support acts.\nSo it was to both my simultaneous\nrelief and surprise when the hirsute\nSam Beam, a.k.a. Iron and Wine,\nstrutted onto the stage, carving up\nthe air around him with his magnificent beard. The sound, despite suffering from some early feedback, was\nwonderfully clear. Ironically, wearing\nan amazing Doctor Who t-shirt, his\nsongs defied time and stretched out\nmelodies, accomplishing so much in\nwhat feels like such a short time. His\nset drew songs from Our Endless\nNumbered Days with a couple of\nnewies and felt both infinitely long\nand delicately short.\nThen Sam announced, \u201cI\u2019m gonna\u2019\nbring on the Calexico guys for a few\nsongs.\u201d These magical words heralded the first set of the songs they wrote\ntogether and it was delightful. One of\nthe songs, Red Dust, featured normal\nand slide guitar solos. This would\nusually make me sigh in despair but I\nloved every minute. Then Calexico\u2019s\nJoey Burns announced that they\nwould take a 10 minute break and\nafter an hour and a half\u2019s worth of\nmusic, I didn\u2019t care one bit.\nTrue to his word, Mr. Burns came\nback after 10 minutes with one\nSalvador Doran, a Mexican version\nof Tom Jones who makes animal\nnoises whilst playing Flamenco gui-tar. As much as that could sound\nboth pretentious and/or awful, it was\nfantastic, and somehow appropriate\nLIVE REVIEW\nThen, when Calexico come back on\nfor their second encore they bring\nIron and Wine on with them along\nwith Salvador, meaning there were\n12 people on stage at once. With this,\nthere was both quantity and quality\nand again the Forum\u2019s sound-system\nkept up with this amassing of musicians and the sound was still clear\nand entrancing. They performed He\nLays in the Reins together (including\nSalvador\u2019s operatic third verse) and\nthis song resonated in my ears for\nlong after I had left the venue\nIron and Wine with Calexico\nThe Forum\nKentish Town\nH H H H H\nThe icing on the cake however was\nthe cover of Velvet Underground\u2019s\nAll Tomorrow\u2019s Parties (the name of\nthe festival that also organised this\nnight). It was an apt near-ending and\na brilliant re-invention of a classic.\nAll I can say is if you can\u2019t appreciate\nmusic like this then I refer back to\nthe aforementioned film in saying:\n\u201cWhat is your major malfunction\nnumb-nuts? Didn\u2019t Daddy show you\nenough attention as a child?\u201d\nMatty Hoban\nDawn of a new, not so\ndifferent era\nIt\u2019s exam and project time for\nmany, and this means a few things.\nOne of them being a thinning of\nFelix. It also means a shortage\nof staff.\nOur ever-opinionated Music editor (and soon-to-be triumphant\nnew Felix editor) Andrew Sykes\nhas a workload the size of an elephant\u2019s love package. This means\nthat I have come to help ease the\nburden that is making this music\nsection the envy of all other music\nsections.\nExam and project stress have\nalso distracted our reviewers, so\nI have taken it upon myself to\nventure into the big, bad world\nand witness some brilliant live\nmusic. But luckily it isn\u2019t the Matty\nShow completely. I have a special\nguest, Nick Simpson, reviewing\nthe extremely long-awaited and\ndisappointing new Tool album. I\nhave to agree with him, it is a slice\nof pap.\nAlso bringing in this new era is\na competition where you, yes you,\ncan win tickets to the Isle of Wight\nfestival!\nMatty Hoban\nacting-Music Editor\nLooks scarily similar to our last family photo portrait. I have a serious case of beard envy though...\n\n"

    "content": "Bored of exams?\nWrite for Felix Science:\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\npacemaker. DBS is clearly a risky and\nserious step to take; as Tiipu Aziz, a\nconsultant neurosurgeon, says: \u201cI as\na surgeon can kill you, tablets can\u2019t,\u201d\nmaking it clear that DBS is only to\nbe considered for extreme cases of\nmovement disorder.\nOne of the strengths of the evening\nwas the combination of technical and\npersonal stories gained from having\nsuch a diverse combination of speak-ers. DBS is both a neat and revolu\u201cIt\u2019s restored life to me,\u201d says Fergus,\nof the procedure known as Deep\nBrain Stimulation (DBS). Now an\nestablished treatment for Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease and other neurological movement disorders, DBS, a combination\nof brain surgery and implant technol-ogy, is becoming more widespread.\nAs we live longer, brain disease will\nbecome more common and managing\nits symptoms and finding a cure will\nbe an ever-increasing problem.\nCertain areas of the brain are overactive in movement disorders such as\nParkinson\u2019s disease, and DBS targets\nthose by the insertion of electrodes\ninto these regions. A high-frequency\ncurrent is then transmitted to the\nelectrodes from a pacemaker, which\ncontrols and generates the electrical pulses and is implanted into the\npatient\u2019s chest under the collarbone.\nThe electrical stimulation effectively\nblocks or reduces the activity of the\nchosen brain region, alleviating the\nsymptoms resulting from the brain\u2019s\nover-activity.\nPart of Brain Awareness Week,\nthe webcast broadcast by the Dana\nCentre was a presentation of the science of DBS by two top surgeons\nin the field, combined with a discussion of the selection procedure\nand follow-up treatment carried out\nby neurologists. Mike Robins, one of\nthe first people to undergo the procedure in this country seven years\nago, goes so far as to turn his pacemaker off, letting us see the reality\nof living with Parkinson\u2019s before the\noperation. He describes conventional\nParkinson\u2019s drugs as making him feel\nas if he were \u201cliving in a bubble\u201d as he\nbecame gradually more despondent\nand marginalised from society. DBS\nbecame a last resort for him, and one\nfor which he is very grateful.\nDespite this being something of a\ncelebration of DBS (another young\nwoman in the audience, Amy Westall,\nwas also on hand in the audience to\ntalk about the positive impact DBS\nhas had on her quality of life), the\ndiscussion was tempered by an intelligent and informative presentation\nfromneurologistDrPatriciaLimousin\nabout the selection procedure and\nrigours of post-operative care, including the trouble patients may have in\nfinding the correct setting for their\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nscience\n\u201cI had the rather\nbizarre feeling of\nhaving crashed\na private party\nwhere people\nexchanged idea\nfor Parkinson\u2019s\nhelp groups\nover wine and\ncanapes.\u201d\nDelving deeper into\nbrain surgery\nDeep brain stimulation is becoming more popular as a\ntreatment for Parkinson\u2019s, but how much of a risk is it?\nA\nnew grooming product launched\nthis week is set to change the way\nwe communicate and even alter the\nway we think. Ockham\u2019s Razor\u2122\nis an application of the philosophy\nof science to everyday life and its\nmakers, PhilosoTech, have billed it\nas a revolutionary tool for \u201ccutting out bad ideas\u201d\nand \u201ctrimming unsightly theories\u201d. The device was\ninspired by an artefact unearthed last year from a\nfourteenth-century grave near Woking.\nOckham\u2019s Razor has been developed in partnership with the university of Edinburgh\u2019s department\nfor Intellectual ParsimonY (DIPY). DIPY\u2019s head,\nProfessor Seth Knox, gave the historical background to this invention:\n\u201cWilliam of Ockham was a man to whom scientists owe a lot. He came up with ideas about theory\ncreation and selection which can be paraphrased\nas: \u2018Don\u2019t multiply entities in a theory\u2019 and \u2018When\nchoosing a theory, go for the one that explains\nthings in terms of what you already know, and in the\nsimplest way.\u2019\u201d\nFor centuries this idea has been described as\nOckham\u2019s Razor, but when Knox and his team discovered Ockham\u2019s tomb in 2005, it seemed his razor\nwas more than metaphor. \u201cWe found a number of\nobjects associated with Ockham\u2019s life, presumably thrown into the burial pit after his coffin. One\nof these was a rather elegant knife, apparently\ndesigned for shaving with.\u201d\nTests on the little knife showed it had never\nbeen sharpened, but a chance discovery revealed\nsomething more interesting. Senior researcher\nSelima Alma described the moment: \u201cI was getting\nnowhere with my analyses. Prof Knox came in and\nasked me how I was doing. I started to describe\nmy procedures and theories about the knife and\nabsent-mindedly scratched my chin with it as I was\ndoing so. Suddenly my redundant ideas fell away,\nand my vague theories crystallised. Knox noticed\nthe difference immediately. He said I was \u2018shaving\nthe phenomena\u2019.\u201d\nAlma and Knox realised the blade was actually influencing the user\u2019s thought processes \u2013\nOckham\u2019s razor indeed existed, and could be used\nto clarify thought, simplify theories and rationalise\npoor logic. Knox decided to conduct some scientific\ntests; he applied the blade to 35 History of Art students and 28 showed a significant increase in verbal\nclarity and logical reasoning for up to five days\nfollowing the application. There were some unforeseen consequences though. As Knox noted: \u201cMost\nof them failed their assignments for that week.\u201d\nPhilosoTech saw the potential market for a retail\nversion of this ancient knife and worked with Knox\nand Alma to develop an up-to-date device. They have\nsince received huge advance orders for Ockham\u2019s\nRazor and their sales manager, Julia Romeo, pointed out some interesting sales patterns: \u201cWe\u2019ve had\nhigh order volumes from the Shoreditch area of\nLondon, parts of Liverpool, and most of Kent. We\nbelieve that these must be regions where people\ntalk complete nonsense most of the time \u2013 hence\nthe demand for such a device.\u201d However, the standout sales successes have been corporate orders\nfrom major consultancy firms Accenture, McKinsey\nand PriceWaterhouseCoopers.\nOckham\u2019s Razor will retail at \u00a312.99 for a set of\nfive disposable blades and a mock-ivory handle.\nOckham\u2019s\nRazor\nDuncan\nMcMillan\nh\ne\nNewer\nScientist\nDeep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a risky and serious step to take.\nAs Tiipu Aziz, a consultant neurosurgeon, says: \u201cI as a surgeon can kill\nyou, tablets can\u2019t.\u201d\nKatherine Nightingale tionary piece of science as well as\na life-changing experience for those\nseeing no other alternative. The contrast between the PowerPoint presentations from the neurosurgeons\n(briefly evoking a scientific conference or lecture hall) and the emotive\nspeeches about DBS from patients\nbalanced the evening nicely and prevented the event from sliding into\neither dry information about the surgery and risks or emotional polemic\nabout the benefits.\nIt dawned on me about halfway\nthrough the evening that I was probably one of the few people there whose\nlife has not been touched by a movement disorder. I had the rather bizarre\nfeeling of having crashed a private\nparty, where people exchanged ideas\nfor Parkinson\u2019s help groups over wine\nand canap\u00e9s. Although not exactly\nscience-in-public, and perhaps not\nwhat the Dana Centre was designed\nfor, this event showed that there is\nclearly a role for a public forum about\nspecific diseases.\nMaybe the speakers were preaching to the converted or giving valuable information to people whose\nlives would be directly affected by the\ntopic. It was certainly the busiest I\u2019ve\never seen the Dana Caf\u00e9, and perhaps indicative about the kind of science the public want to be informed\nabout.\n5\nfelix\nThursday 18 May 2006 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

You\u2019re all losers. Facebook\nlosers. I suppose you can be forgiven\nbecause Imperial students are so inept\nat any face-to-face social activity that\nwe have to resort to an online feeding frenzy to message people we see\neveryday anyway. I am as guilty as the\nrest of you. If you\u2019re not on Facebook\nyou\u2019re nobody. But even if you are,\nit doesn\u2019t make you somebody. Even\nthough everyone loves seeing everyone else\u2019s drunken photos, there really\nare (believe it or not) better things to\ndo. Is it only me or do any of you trawl\nthrough innumerable lists of friends\u2019\nfriends\u2019 friends trying to find either a)\nan extreme hottie that clearly doesn\u2019t\nhave the brain for Imperial but you\npray that they might be within a 5 mile\nradius of London, or b) an extreme\nugly who just has the \u2018point and laugh\u2019\nfactor.\nUgly people make you feel better\nabout yourself. And great stress-reliev-ers. Just zip them up in a punchbag,\nhang it up, think of cute little Indian\nchildren starving because these people are using up food, and away you go.\nLet it all out. You have my permission.\nIt\u2019s not like you could make them look\nworse anyway, and a few kicks gets\nthe blood circulating. They\u2019ll come out\nlooking like they\u2019ve just stepped out of\n\u2018The Sound of Music\u2019. You might have\neven changed their life.\nWhat is great about Facebook is that\nit doesn\u2019t only extend to people in the\nUK, so if you really can\u2019t find anyone\nto poke fun at in England, although\ntrust me there are plenty, you can\ncross the Atlantic and check out all the\nAmericans. Oh yes. There are those\nwho are self-confessed geeks or gang-sters, and then there are the understated ones who refuse to accept their\nmeaninglessness, but one look at their\nphotos says it all. Shame.\nYou can use the great search engine\nto find anyone you want, any nationality,\nany sexual persuasion, no limits! The\nonly problem is that you really have to\nput yourself out there and actually ask\npeople, including Americans, to be\nyour friends. It\u2019s almost as pleasurable as being thrown into\nthe gutter. Your dignity disappears like copper coins\nbeing thrown away one at a\ntime, down the drain. Then\nonce you\u2019ve got your face in\nthe sewer you are obliged\nto hold your breath and sit\ntight until Mr/Mrs/Miss/Ms.\nRedneck can gallop on their\nfamily pony to the single computer in the whole of Utah and\n\u2018accept\u2019 you on their only\nsocial network. I really\n\u2018accept\u2019 them too, in\nmy heart, just like I\n\u2018accept\u2019 retards.\nIf I wasn\u2019t so desperate for a laugh\nthey wouldn\u2019t have to make all that\neffort just for me. But I am, and they\ndo. It\u2019s politics. We treat Americans\nlike the office slave: call them over,\nsmile politely and pretend that we\nwant them to make some coffee, wait\nuntil they make it and bring it over,\nthen frown and say it isn\u2019t REAL cof-fee, can\u2019t they understand irony, tell\nthem to get out of our sight, and after\nthey\u2019ve shuffled away we laugh like\nthe evil Mojo Jojo we all are. The\nmore satanic of us (probably me)\nwould laugh directly in their face. This\nprocess repeats throughout the whole\nof life: Americans appealing to the\nEnglish, trying to please us, and in\nreturn we nod, smile and turn away\nlike we would do to a begging leper. But\nlet\u2019s face it, if we didn\u2019t protect\nthe chip on our shoulder they\nwould probably eat it. They are\nlike us at Imperial in many\nways: they have social prob-lems, disabilities, and are\nwilling to take desperate\nmeasures to fit in. You\nknow you can tell that\na computer belongs to\nan American from the\nKrispy Kreme icing all\nover the keyboard. They\nreally are unclean. And\nobese. But that\u2019s another\nCoffee Break.\nFacebook is a worldwide\nphenomenon. There are\npeople who have been\nmade famous by it. I\nkid you not. One of these very promising individuals has made her mark on\nmen of all ages, especially the editors\nof the acclaimed literature: \u201cMaxim\u201d\nand \u201cPlayboy\u201d She is full of talent, from\nthe fabulous town of Silicone Valley,\nUSA, and is truly a living inspiration\nfor us all, and shows us that dreams\nreally can come true, if you just put\nyour brain cell and breasts into it. In\nother words, get naked and see what\nhappens. In a world like this, you can\nnever have too much fake tan. Out\nwith Miss World, in with the \u2018Facebook\nPrincess\u2019, Jenn Sterger. Things have\nnever been so good. In a recent interview she revealed how she found true\nhappiness: \u201cI just have an amazing\nsurgeon\u201d. She has proven that people\nlove her for who she is: \u201calmost every\ngirl on facebook wants my doctor\u2019s\nnumber\u201d. Jenn is an upstanding young\nwoman, a wonderful role model, showing that we really don\u2019t have to live\nwith what we were born with. She is\nno longer the shy, reserved woman\neveryone found so boring, and at the\nend of the interview she dispenses\none last precious snippet of true natu-ralism: \u201cdamn it, I\u2019m going to shake\nwhat my doctor gave me!\u201d In a later\ninterview the doctor reviewed his new\nsurgical technique, implanting unused\ntissue from other areas of the body\nto enhance the silicone, but he was\nunwilling to reveal which tissue he\nused with Jenn. Brain?\nFacebook really has made a differ-ence. But we must stop using it to\nexcuse ourselves from the vital tasks\nat hand, like getting battered at the\nUnion bar. Instead of laughing over a\nsnakebite and triple vodka with real\npeople, we are determined to sit in our\nrooms and laugh to ourselves with our\ncomputers. Please. Just because we\u2019re\nat Imperial it doesn\u2019t mean we have to\nbe cybersocial. I know you have money,\nso quit booking your face appointments\nwith Doctor Alone and get\nout more.\n\u201cDreams really can\ncome true, if you just\nput your brain cell\nand breasts into it.\u201d\nF A C E B O O K\nFOR DUMMIES\nHOW TO MAKE\nFRIENDS AND\nPOKE PEOPLE\nUnless you\u2019ve been under a rock for\nthe last week you can\u2019t fail to have\nnoticed the revolution sweeping the\ncollege: Facebook. It\u2019s basically a social\nnetworking website, like MySpace or\nFaceparty. You have a profile where\nyou put your details, your photo and\nvarious fascinating tidbits of information such as your favourite book and\nhow much you love Coldplay.\nThe \u2018cool\u2019 thing about it is that you\nhave a friends list, where you can add\nall your bestest pals from college and\nhome. As your friends list grows, so\ndoes your e-penis, and in life the biggest penis wins.\nIf you really haven\u2019t got with the\ntimes yet and signed up, here are a few\nbasic steps to get started:\n1) Go to www.facebook.com assuming you have a computer handy (of\ncourse you do, this is Imperial, by the\ntime you read this you will probably\nhave a microchip under your skin/in\nyour tooth/eye with fully-functioning\nWAP).\n2) You have to register. Check your\nemail. Get your password.\n3) Log in and create your own pro-file. Make sure you put down your\nuniversity/college as Imperial, the year\nyou\u2019re going to graduate, then you\nhave access to all the groups and stuff.\nYou can upload photos, make albums\nand all that jazzle. The photos have to\nbe 4MB or smaller. We\u2019ve also thoughtfully included a guide to taking the\nprettiest picture.\nIt\u2019s pretty self-explanatory, and if you\nneed any more help than that you really shouldn\u2019t be at this university should\nyou? Unless you\u2019ve Forrest Gump-ed\nyour way in, in which case your mother\nmust be getting tired of screwing all\nthese old bald professors.\nSo you\u2019ve got your profile, you\u2019ve got\nyour sexy picture, and you\u2019re ready\nto Facebook. First of all you\u2019ll want to\ncheck out your friends\u2019 profiles and\nclick Add *whoever* As A Friend to\nshow them how much you care. Protip: You can also click this button on\npeople you don\u2019t know but just want\nto touch.\nYou can also send people messages.\nShould you find an attractive target\nand wish to court them in a proper\nmanner, rather than being all rough\nand ready and heading straight for\nfriendship, this is the way to go. Just\ndon\u2019t forget to put plenty of xxxs at\nthe end. The occasional ;-) goes a long\nway too.\nYou\u2019ve bound to have noticed the\nPoke button by now. Poking has no\npurpose. It is completely pointless.\nHowever it is childish and fun to go\naround poking strangers, and of course\npoking back those who were foolish\nenough to poke you.\nThere\u2019s also a group system. You\nmightwanttojoinTheDavidHasselhoff\nAppreciation Society, or maybe The\nAppreciation Society Appreciation\nSociety. Felix also has a group but it\u2019s\nfar too rad for mugs like you lot.\nThere you have it, Facebook in a\nnutshell. Just remember to revise\nrather than spending your time stalking Medic girls.\nSo you\u2019ve decided to join the revolution\nand whore yourself out on Facebook.\nExcellent. Only the most desperate\nand horny person will poke you if you\ndon\u2019t include a picture of yourself\nthough, and unfortunately that school\nphoto isn\u2019t going to cut it, ugly.\nThe first step is to realise that cool\npeople don\u2019t know how to use the self-timer on their cameras and that mirror shots are the way to go. Make\nsure you include cool things in the\nbackground though. Even the smallest\ndetails count!\nIt\u2019s a scientifically proven fact that\nthe longer and floppier your fringe, the\nmore interesting you become. It also\nhelps to hide your Doherty-esque complexion and any unsightly blemishes\nsuch as your face. You\u2019ll also want to\nuse eyeliner and mascara here. The\nBeetlejuice look is popular this year.\nNow for the pose. You want to be a\nmix of erotic and exotic. Even though\nthis picture is the most important\nmoment of your life, you need to look\nlike your so damn hip you don\u2019t even\nneed to look at the camera.

Typically, it is a\nbranch of the investment banking\ndivision, and is divided in two sectors\nknown as equity and debt capital markets (DCM). The main products they\nform are shares and bonds respec-tively, and do so to raise money for\ncompanies. Recently, however, banks\nare combining ECM and DCM into a\nsingle division.\nThis week shall deal with ECM.\nEurope saw a 400% increase in equity\nfinancing in 2004 with deals totalling\n$30.6 billion, compared to a meagre\n$5.7 billion, the previous year. Those\nworking within capital markets find\nthemselves principally involved in\none of three things, including: originating new business, structuring the\nproducts or syndicating, which entails\npitching newly prepared instruments\nto potential investors.\nThe most publicised work of ECM is\nthe initial public offering (IPO). This\nis where a private company decides\nthat, in order to raise finances it will\nsell its shares to the public, usually\nvia a stock exchange. There are rare\ninstances when the motive is not to\nraise capital but stocks being sold\nas a secondary offering by existing\nshareholders.\nThis was the case for the USA\u2019s\nlargest IPO in 1998 when DuPont sold\npart of itself to Conoco for $4.4 billion.\nSome of the largest IPOs occur when\ngovernments sell their holdings in\nstock to raise money. This was the\ncase for the largest ever deal that\nCity explained: Equity Capital Markets\n\u2022 Inflation for April up by 2 per cent\non pervious month\n\u2022 Bank of England says rate hike\nlikely despite fears over economy\ncent in April, a 3 per cent increase\non the previous month. The Bank\nof England signalled the next move\nwould be a rise in base rates. The US\nFederal Reserve has already raised\nrates to 5 per cent. Money markets\nhave priced in a 25 basis point rise\nthis summer and a 50 point rise for\nmid 2007 in the sterling. The bank\nis, however, cautious about a lack of\ncapacity in the economy and does\nnot wish to overreact on wage inflation data. Consumer sentiment is still\nhigh, though, due to a resilient housing market and expensive assets.\nDespite economic forecasts being\nrevised on the downside, Mervin King\nwas still optimistic about the state of\nthe economy, highlighting a strong\nexternal environment. Projections\nshow that this year will be the first\ntime, since 1995, that the trade balance is positive and contributes to\nthe economy.\ninvolved $13 billion worth of stock\nin Nippon Telegraph and Telephone\nbeing offered by the Japanese gov-ernment.\nOnce a company decides to go pub-lic, its first decision is to pick an\nunderwriter. The choosing of managers is often known as the \u2018beauty\ncontest\u2019. This involves meeting with\ninvestment bankers form different\nfirms who pitch what they think the\ncompany is worth and how much\nstock they can realistically sell.\nUnderwriters are the midwives in\nthe birth of financial products and\ntheir role is three-fold. Initially, they\nexplain the procedure and provide\nadvice, after which they then buy the\nnewly issued instruments that are\nfinally resold to the public. After an\nunderwriter is chosen, that firm\u2019s\nlawyers and accountants prepare\na registration statement to be filed\nwith the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC). It is a lengthy\nand dry document covering a range\nof issues, including proposed financing and the history of the company.\nThe most important aspect of the\nregistration documents is the S-1\nform, also known as the prospectus.\nIt is vital to get this right because it\nis distributed to potential investors.\nCreating a prospectus is a highly\nexpensive process because it involves\nan array of highly paid professionals.\nThis culminates in something known\nas \u201cgoing to the printer\u201d. This highly\nstressful endeavour involves law-yers, bankers and accountants being\nlocked in at printing houses where\nthey must work together continuously until the prospectus is perfected.\nIt is not all bad news though. These\n24-hour financial printers (the largest\nbeing Bowne and Donnelley) offer all\nthe gourmet food you can eat, baths,\nshowers and other amenities.\nWhilst the firm awaits a decision\nfrom the SEC, it is busy calculating\nthe issue price. This is done using\nmodels like price to earnings ratio\ncomparisons and discounted cash\nflow models. Once the SEC gives\nthe green light, something known as\nthe road show takes place. This is a\nmarketing exercise where the banks\ntalks to potential investors who will\nmostly be institutional investors such\nas mutual fund or pension fund man-agers. They will then give the bank\nthe maximum price they are willing\nto pay and how many dollars they are\nprepared to put forward. Although\ninvestors are not legally bound by\ntheir promises, they will want to stay\nin the underwriters\u2019 good books so as\nto remain in the loop when it comes\nto future opportunities.\nWhen selecting a price, underwriters are extremely cautious and usually do not go for the highest possible\nsince this might put off investors and\nleave unsold stocks. Some degree\nof under pricing also leaves room to\ntemp other investors. This is where a\nconflict of interest might arise. Since\nthe underwriters agree to buy the\nstock and then sell it to the public,\nthey do not want any unsold shares\nsince that leaves them with market\nexposure. On the other hand, the\ncompany wants a high a price as\npossible to raise as much capital as\nit can since that is, in most cases,\nthe motive behind floating on a stock\nexchange. In return for underwriting the stock, the bank profits from\na spread. That is they are allowed to\nbuy the stock for less than they sell\nit to the public. The company is also\nbilled for any administrative costs\nincurred by the bank.\nThe most expensive aspect of an\nIPO is under pricing. The cost is\nhidden but very real and is famously\nillustrated with eBay. The prospectus for eBay estimated that investors\nwould be interested in a stock price\nof $14 to $16. However, they failed to\naccount for the huge interested this\nnew web-based economy had gener-ated. By the end of the first day of\ntrading over 4.5 million shares traded\nand the close was $47.375. In the UK,\nIPOs increase by an average of 20%\nafter floating, but this premium is\nshort-lived and prices usually settle\nwithin five years.\nBankers in ECM can typically\nexpect similar pay to those in M&A\nwith some managing directors\nachieving seven figure bonuses at\nthe best firms for the largest deals.\nThe dot-com crash has hampered the\nindustry but the number of IPOs is\nback on the increase.\neBay stocks increased by 260 per cent on the first day of trading\n4\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 18 May 2006\n\n"

As\nthe students looked over the original\nexam paper last Thursday, several\nnoticed that both pages were identi-cal. The exam paper had two sets of\nthe same three questions, whereas\nthere should have been three on one\npage and two on the other.\nThe students were informed that\nthe Geometry of Surfaces exam was\ncancelled and they would all have\nto go home and await instructions.\nSubsequently, all students received an\nemail asking them when they would\nbe available to re-run the exam. As\nthis is the exam period and students\nhave many other commitments, the\nonly time all the students were available was Saturday afternoon.\nEmily Lines, one of the affected\nstudents, told Felix: \u201cThis is totally\nunacceptable, how can a simple error\nlike this happen at Imperial which is\nsupposed to be a top-flight University.\nThis won\u2019t only negatively affect my\nperformance in this exam but also\nmy other exams as my revision timetable is now all over the place.\u201d\nFelix contacted Dr Frank Berkshire,\nthe Director of Undergraduate\nStudies for Applied Mathematics, to\nask if the department believed that\nstudents would be significantly disadvantaged by the mistake.

It\u2019s\nessential that I build on what I\u2019ve already got.\nWhy didn\u2019t you stand at the last election?\nMainly because it wasn\u2019t a good time. I have\nmuch more time now. I think I should stand,\nthat\u2019s why I\u2019m standing.\nAre you just standing for CV points?\nWhat!? No, I\u2019ve got lots of CV points. My CV\nis full.\nHow do you think Tim Weinert-Aplin has\nperform in the role so far?\nHe\u2019s done a good job. He\u2019s very pro-active at\ncontacting societies. Fair enough there have\nbeen times when he hasn\u2019t been able to fulfill\ntheir wishes, that\u2019s the difficulty of the role.\nIf you get the job, what would be the one\nlegacy you\u2019d like to leave?\nTo ensure the Union redevelopment goes as\nsmoothly as possible. Next year we really need\nto make sure the groundwork is laid success-fully. The Union needs a viable future.\nIf you don\u2019t get the job, what will you do\nnext year?\nUmm. I don\u2019t have anything specific planned.\nBit of travelling, temporary jobs. Then apply for\na graduate schemes next year.\nf\n2006 Sabb\nElections Special\nManifesto\nWith the redevelopment of the Union, as well as\nCollege\u2019s decision to leave the University of London,\nnext year will undoubtedly be challenging. Next year\u2019s\nSabbs will have important decisions to make, affecting\nboth current and future students.\nHaving been in an elected position for my three\nyears at Imperial, I believe that I have shown my\ndedication and proved that I have the necessary skills\nto produce results.\nThis year I have been the Life Sciences Union\nCommunications Officer and Broadsheet Co-editor.\nDeveloping communication networks with students\nand companies has been essential and I have secured\nsponsorship which I hope will aid next years RCSU.\nStudying Biology with Management I have taken\nmodules in Finance, Accounting, and Project\nManagement which will aid my performance as DP\n(F&S).\nFundamentally I am running for DP as I feel that I\nwould be good at the job and serve students well.\nDaniel\nChowdury\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT (FINANCE & SERVICES)\nManifesto\nThe DPFS is not just a Union pen pusher: the winner\nof this election will take a key role in overseeing the\ndelivery of Union commercial and welfare services, as\nwell as guiding vital projects such as the union building redevelopment.\nI\u2019ve listened to students and staff to discern priorities for the coming year; my 10 manifesto pledges are\nlaid out on a separate page ad in this Felix. All are\nachievable: if followed through they will make a tangible difference to our university life.\nSince arriving at Imperial I\u2019ve been involved in\nstudent issues. I\u2019ve served on Union Council, as my\ncourse year rep, as a re-app and as treasurer of the\nDebating Society.\nWe need a DPFS who is approachable, honest and\nwho has a sense of humour. Let\u2019s finish electing a\ngreat team and make 2006/7 a year to remember!\nSee www.edhunt.me.uk for more details\nWhy are you standing for this position?\nIn the past people haven\u2019t viewed DPFS as an\nimportant position, just as a glorified accoun-tant. But, it has a key role in determining the\nsuccess of the Union.\nDo you think that\u2019s enough experience?\nIn the first year I was an ordinary member of\nCouncil. I am now a re-app in Evelyn Gardens,\nwhich allows me to keep in touch with the first\nyears, who are very keen users of the Union.\nI\u2019m also a course year rep and treasurer of the\ndebating society.\nAre you just standing for CV points?\nNo. If I wanted CV points I\u2019d have got a job.\nMy CV is not my first motivation. I care about\nstudent welfare. If student democracy is going\nto succeed people have to stand up.\nYou are suggesting the Union should employ\na dedicated alumni fund raiser, won\u2019t this\njust cost money?\nIt will be cost neutral. At a university like\nImperial, which is a leading European univer-sity, there are a lot of very successful gradu-ates. A lot of them would be keen to lend their\nsupport. I had a gap year at a US uni and they\nmade a lot out of alumni. Its a shame we don\u2019t\nutilise this. Oxbridge do it a lot.\nA lot of people think the Union sucks.\nDoes it?\nThe Union has achieved a fair amount - the\nBuilding redevelopment, the new website etc.\nIf I am elected I have the ideas to move things\nforward. People normally underestimate the\nscope of the DPFS.\nWhy didn\u2019t you stand at the last election?\nIt didn\u2019t occur to me. But, seeing who has been\nelected I\u2019d really like to work with them.\nSome people think you\u2019re too political, are\nyou?\nI don\u2019t think DPFS is a political position.\nHowever, involvement in politics demonstrates\na passion for the issues.\nEdmund\nHunt\nManifesto\nImperial is a world-class institution, isn\u2019t it time you\nreceived world-class services?\nThe Union is you, its members, but this seems to\nhave been forgotten.\nThe Sabbs work for you, you are their boss but most\npeople feel that neither the Union nor the Sabbs serve\nor are relevant to them, this must change.\nProgress has been made this year but we still have\na long way to go, I can help us get there.\nIf elected, I will:\n\u2022 Listen, be directly accountable and ensure I am available to you, not just hidden in an office.\n\u2022 Drive for more funding for the refurbishment ensuring you benefit and have input every step of the way.\n\u2022 Correct the unacceptable increases in bar (over 100%\nin my seven years at Imperial) and events prices.\n\u2022 Give the Faculty Unions the support and independence they need.\nVote for yourselves, vote Jon Matthews for DPFS.\nWhy are you standing for this position?\nI have a great deal of experience at Imperial.\nI\u2019ve lived with students for 5 years, which has\ngiven me a lot of understanding and knowledge\nof the issues they face. I\u2019m standing for balanced representation, not political ambition.\nWhat previous positions have you held at the\nUnion?\nI\u2019ve been a backroom boy and been mainly on\nthe accommodation committee for 4 years. I\u2019ve\nalso contributed to council meetings, but not\nheld a massively high position in paper.\nI also have a great deal more experienced that\nthe other candidates.\nYou want to continue as a subwarden next\nyear, wouldn\u2019t that be detrimental to a sabb\npost?\nI am a subwarden for the sense of pleasure I\nget from the job and for the big differences I\ncan make to the students.\nThere were some efforts from a minority to\nprevent from being one. I do, however, have full\nand complete support from the warning team.\nWhy didn\u2019t you stand in the last elections?\nI\u2019m a research student; I asked the department\nwhether or not I could take a Sabb year in the\nmiddle of my PhD research. They said they\u2019ll\nget back to me. Nominations had closed by the\ntime I found out.\nHave the Sabbs done a good job this year?\nThe President has done a very good job this\nyear but maybe the rest of the Sabbs could\nspeak to people as well! People in residences\ndon\u2019t even know who the Deputy President\n(Education and Welfare) is.\nAre you against the smoking ban?\nShould the union serve the vast majority? I\nthink it should consider all students. You can\njudge services by how many people turn up. I\nstood up in public for what I believed was right.\nIf people vote on a single issue basis, they\naren\u2019t doing themselves justice.\nI will promise I will make no attempt to reverse\nthe ban. We should not buck the trend. It\nwould be undemocratic to do so.\nJon\nMatthews\n14\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 18 May 2006\n\n"

Look for simple solu-tions. The simpler, the better \u2013 like\nbecoming an avrts student.\nChocolate Sex\nDear Miss Confidentiality,\nMy boyfriend and I like to keep things\nexciting with a little sexual experi-mentation, so when he suggested the\nconsumption of a Mars Bar from my\nnether regions I decided to give it\na shot. The experience was unexpectedly pleasureable, I must say.\nHowever, as things got hotter and\nmore slippery...it was necessary to\nkeep reinserting the chocolate as\nit kept falling out, and after several\nreinsertions we were alarmed to find\nthat the bar emerged missing a rather large chunk of the end. After both\nof us had spent a good half hour having a rummage around for it with no\nsuccess, we decided that a trip to A &\nE was called for. The situation was\nrectified after an embarassing half\nhour with the nurse, who seemed particularly g\nood humoured upon hearing what had happened. The majority of the chocolate was removed,\nbut I was told not to be alarmed if I\nwere to experience any brown dis-charge. Thing is, despite the ordeal,\nI rather enjoyed myself and would\nlike to try this out again, minus the\ndrama. I'm a bit worried about infection too. L\nashy, I need your sexual\nexpertise on how I can make this one\nwork.\nAmy\nDear Amy,\nFirst, way too much information. And\nsecondly, what the hell is wrong with\nyou?! What could you possibly find a\nturn on about someone eating brown\nsolids from an area close to your\nexcretory - is this a word? as in the\narea where you crap from? region. I\nmean I'm certainly not one to turn my\nnose up at a little sexual adventure as\nmany....MANY lucky men will remember - though none of you Imperialite\nfreaks - but there are far better ways\nof keeping the spark going, leading\nto f\nar fewer complications. As long\nas there are no police present. But if\nyou insist on partaking in such activities in the future, dear God woman,\nhave a bit of common sense and keep\nit in the wrapper! It doesn't take a\ngenius. Make sure y\nou cut off the\nsharp bits first though...\nMy room-mate is a weirdo\nDear Miss Confidentiality,\nI\u2019m a fresher and I\u2019ve just moved\ninto halls. I\u2019ve been assigned a room-mate, but she has some very strange\ncustoms. I know I should be tolerant\nof her beliefs but its weird, should I\nspeak to her about it or what? This is\nthe first time I\u2019ve ever shared a room,\nand I really don\u2019t know how to act\naround her. What do you suggest?\nAngela, 18\nDear Angela,\nWell firstly don\u2019t worry! I think that\nas you\u2019ve never shared a room before\nyou\u2019re probably feeling extra anxious,\nbut I wouldn\u2019t worry too much. You\u2019re\nnow at university and you\u2019re starting\nafresh learning new things and in\nyour case new customs. I mean unless\nyour roommate follows some sort of\nvampire culture, where she\u2019s going\nto attempt to drink your blood I don\u2019t\nsee any reason for you to not accept\nit, ask some questions about what\nshe\u2019s doing and why.\nMaybe your problem is just that you\ndon\u2019t understand the customs. If\nthe reason you\u2019re feeling awkward\nis because your roommate is trying\nto force her beliefs on you that\u2019s a\ndifferent story. Simply pass on the\nfact that you hate the taste of blood\nand really don\u2019t find people\u2019s necks\nthat attractive, hopefully she\u2019ll let the\ntopic drop.\nI want my Mum\nDear Miss Confidentiality,\nI don\u2019t know where to turn to, ever\nsince I\u2019ve come to uni I\u2019ve just felt\nso homesick, I miss home so much,\nI really can\u2019t stand it. It\u2019s so strange\nand scary and all I want to do is go\nback home and be with my friends\nback home. What should I do?\nLize, 18\nDear Lize,\nI know it\u2019s hard to start all over again\nat a new place, and that being back\nat home is just comfortable. It may\nseem easier, but you\u2019d just be missing out. University is a great oppor-tunity, and a chance for you to just\nhave some fun. You need to just get\nout there and start having some fun,\nmeeting new people and living!!\nYou\u2019re in London, there is so much\nto do. I understand that it seems like\na big challenge, so start small, join a\nfew club and societies at college, start\nhanging around in the common room\nat halls, start making some friends\nand you\u2019ll feel a lot happier, even if\nall you end up doing is playing cards\nor game cube in your kitchen.

Some\nof them may not even know how to\nmake toast, or may end up setting\npizza on fire!

Jocelyn Prudence\n(Chief Executive of the UCEA) called\nthese calculations \u201cmisleading\u201d\nand said that the offer \u201cexceeds the\n[AUT\u2019s] original demand\u201d. She also\ncriticised the Union for not putting\nthe offer to its members for a vote.\nThis latest breakdown in the emergency discussions leaves many\nfinal-year students considering legal\naction against their universities as\nthey are uncertain as to whether\ntheir exams will take place and even\nwhether they will graduate. Many\nsay that this situation is preventing\nthem from finding employment, leaving them with lost earnings, a feeling\nof helpless limbo, and a bitterness\nthat is mainly directed at the UCEA\nand their own institutions.\nImperial is not affected by these\ndevelopments since staff at College\nare under local pay negotiations and\ncannot take part in the national dis-pute. However, IC staff are also due\nfor similar pay negotiation before\nAugust this year, but talks have not\nyet begun. The situation does not\nbode well for higher education in general as anger grows over the inequality in pay rises between education\nstaff and university administration.\nOver the last three years vice-chan-cellors have been awarded an aver-UK students panic as\nemergency AUT talks collapse\nAndrew Somerville age increase of 25%.\nThe AUT fears a \u2018meltdown\u2019 across\nhigher education as exams are cancelled and marking deadlines come\nand go. Edinburgh, Aberystwyth and\nLiverpool universities have already\ncancelled upto twenty exams, and\nmany universities are advising that\ntheir students check daily for updates\non the internet.\nUniversities are attempting to quell\nthe disruption by implementing emergency contingency plans, but this is\ncausing concern in some quarters\nabout the quality of degrees awarded\nthis year, fearing that standards will\nnot be upheld.\nAs tempers fray on both sides of\nthe debate, more strikes are planned.\nSome universities have begun to\ndock lecturers\u2019 pay for failing to mark\nexams; an end to the deadlock is still\nnot in sight.\nHazardous waste abandoned at Imperial hospital\nImperial medic walks into overflowing bags of waste outside a public-access lift in Charing Cross Hospital.\nChris Miles\nNews Editor\nMedical students at Charing Cross\nHospital were put in direct contact\nwith an unattended skip of clinical\nwaste as they attempted to enter the\nhospital's laboratory block on Friday,\n12 May.\nOverflowingbags,whichcancontain\nanything from human tissue to drugs\nand dressings, were obstructing the\nexit from a lift, which is accessible to\npatients, students and visitors at the\nhospital. One student walked into an\noverflowing clinical waste bag as she\nleft a public-access lift on route to her\ntutorial. She had to move the yellow\n\u2018biohazard\u2019 containers in order to get\npast the obstruction.\nThe distressed fourth year student\ntold Felix: \u201cThis is utterly unaccept-able. It looked as if someone had left\nearly for the weekend and dumped a\nskip of potentially hazardous waste\nin front of a lift for some poor soul\nto walk right into. The bags were\nunstable and if one had split open, I\ndread to think what might have happened.\u201d\nThere are usually stringent controls\nin place to ensure that clinical waste\nis managed safely and is disposed of\nwithout harming the environment or\nhuman health. Contravention of waste\ncontrols is a criminal offence. Section\n34 of the Environment Protection Act\n1990 places people concerned with\nclinical waste under a duty of care\nto ensure that the waste is disposed\nof safely and is only transferred to\nsomeone who is authorised to handle\nit.\nStudents noticed that the waste had\nbeen left untouched for two hours\nand contacted Felix to voice their\nconcerns. We spoke to the hospital\nswitchboard to report the incident\nand were put through to the Duty\nPorter\u2019s office, who confusingly said,\n\u201cput it in the bin\u201d. We later contacted Imperial College Charing Cross\nSecurity and the skip was removed\nfor incineration within the hour.\nAn employee working nearby\ndescribed the situation as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and immediately contacted\nthe hospital\u2019s Health and Safety\nExecutive. The Facilities Department\nat Charing Cross Hospital are currently investigating the matter.\nDanny McGuiness, ICSM SU\nPresident, said: \u201cThis is indeed\nunacceptable and I sincerely hope\nit has been reported to the Health\nand Safety Lead at the Trust. Our\nstudents should be able to go about\ntheir studies and placements safe in\nthe knowledge that their health and\nsafety will come to no harm.\u201d\nCollege released this statement:\n\u201cThe College is concerned by the\nreports that a clinical waste cart was\nmistakenly left outside the entrance\nto the laboratory block... Although\nthe College is confident no one was at\nrisk under these circumstances, an\ninvestigation has been launched with\nthe Hammersmith Hospitals Trust\nto determine the events which led to\nImperial academics pictured outside College protesting for an increase in London salary weighting .\nthis incident.\nAll clinical waste is first placed in\nclearly marked bags prior to loading\nonto a clinical waste cart and disposal\nis thereafter handled by the NHS\nTrust with whom the College regularly liaises.\nAll staff and students at the College\nare made aware of the potential risks\nposed by it, in accordance with both\nCollege and Trust health and safety\nregulations.\u201d\nLeader, page 19\nA silent bike ride is to take place\non Wednesday 17 May in memory\nof cyclists killed and injured by\nmotorists. The scheme, part of a US\n\u2018International Ride of Silence\u2019 ini-tiative, will involve a 10 mile route\nthrough the city\u2019s Hyde Park.\nImperial College student Apijak\nSrivannavit was killed in a road traffic\naccident whilst cycling in the South\nKensington area last summer.\nMr Srivannavit was at the junction\nof Queen\u2019s Gate and Cromwell Road\nwhen he was hit by a coach. The\ncoroner\u2019s report concluded that both\nthe coach driver and the cyclist were\nto blame for the collision; however, no\naction was taken against the coach\ndriver by the Crown Prosecution\nService.\nIn June of last year, Thomas SippelDau, an ICT manager, was also\nknocked off his bicycle and killed by\na 4x4 vehicle. The upcoming ride\nwill visit the sites where the College\nmembers were killed.\nBen Jefferys, Chair of the Union\u2019s\nBicycle User Group, told Felix: \u201cI\nhope this is a fitting tribute for Apijak\nand the other cyclists who have died\nin London. It has been organised with\nthe cooperation of Apijak's family.\nThis event will be followed up by a\nvigorous safety and awareness cam-paign, funded by a generous donation\nto ICBUG from Apijak's father.\u201d\nAnyone wishing to take part should\nmeet at Hyde Park Corner at 6:30pm\non 17 May.

Upon\narrival we were presented with large,\ninsulated ponchos, sporting fur collars and hoods, that made us look like\ncamp Nordic members of the Ku Klux\nKlan. Everything from the walls to\nthe bar was carved entirely from ice,\nand not any old frozen Thames Valley\nTap Water, but as our obliging antipo-dean barman \u2018Jase\u2019 proudly informed\nus, ice specially imported from the\nTourne river in Sweden. This spectacle was further enhanced by ambient\nblue lighting, breathtaking ice sculp-tures, and reindeer pelts to sit on\u2026\nEven the glasses were little more\nthan hollowed out blocks of ice.\nThe management insisted we \u2018sample\u2019 every beverage on the menu.\nThe drinks, invariably vodka based,\nbore Nordic-esque names such as\n\u2018The Howling Husky\u2019 and \u2018Northern\nLights\u2019. Everyone we spoke to stipulated that it was nigh on impossible\nto get drunk in the ice-bar, yet lo and\nbehold, two-and-a-half hours later\n(one-hour-and-three-quarters over\nthe maximum time the establishment and conventional safety laws\nwould allow plus numerous requests\nto vacate the premises from the\nmanagement) we had accomplished\nthis feat, and almost collapsed on\nRegent\u2019s Street\u2026\nThe establishment\u2019s entrance fee\nwas twelve pounds (one free drink\nincluded) which perhaps explained\nthe large number of \u2018wanker-bankers\u2019 and suit-wearing monkeys\namongst the clientele. We leapt upon\nthe opportunity to challenge some\nbearded Germanic businessmen to\nan impromptu curling match, using\nour glasses and the slippery surface\nof the bar. After sending at least two\nglasses cascading towards the floor\nwe decided to call it an honourable\ndraw, but Fritz was having none of\nit!

The staff were\nfun and friendly and we were able to\nrequest ice in our drink or cappuccinos at least five times before they\nwearied of the jokes that must plague\nthem on an hourly basis.\nOne or two things did strike us as\nstrange about the bar, for instance:\nthe fact that there was a fire escape.\nCall us crazy, but how could it hap-pen? Furthermore, if you stood in the\nsame place, leaned against the walls,\nor propped up the bar for any significant period of time, you tended to\nbecome attached to the surface. After\na while this can become a tad embar-rassing, especially if one is chatting to\na large number of attractive Swedish\nyoung ladies.\nCustomers are only allowed into\nthe bar for forty-five minute slots yet\nthe venue also boasts an adjoining\nbar and lounge bearing the name\n\u2018Below Zero\u2019. In stark contrast to the\nice bar, the theme is \u2018warmth\u2019, with\nroaring fires and ambient red-orange\nlighting. Food is served, but alas,\nafter rinsing \u00a3240 worth of Felix complimentary drinks in the Ice Bar the\nmanagement shockingly did not permit us to sample the delights of the\nmenu (which interestingly included\nKangaroo steaks and roast Ostrich)\nTo summarise, the bar was expen-sive, yet well worth the money as it\nis a truly unique experience. It would\nmake fantastic date material and it is\nguaranteed to impress, despite the\nfact it may seem almost impossible to\nget her drunk.

The Twist\nparties are the brainchild of I.T.S. veteran Harry Narenthira aka Harrybo\nand have been running for three years\nnow. These parties have witnessed\nperformances from some of the biggest personalities in Imperial College\nincluding MC Rashad the Human\nBeatbox and Funkology, the high profile dance troupe! They have been\nhosted at some of London\u2019s top night\nclubs including Rococo and Zoo Bar,\nraising over a thousand pounds for\nvarious charities including Medical\nInstitute of Tamils.\nThe 3rd of May 2006 saw Twist\ngrace the glamorous location of\nMayfair at the favourite celebrity\nhaunt: Capisce. The 200 strong crowd\non the night fitted perfectly with the\nplush venue with students\u2019 glamming\nthemselves up with tiaras and fur\ncoats. Although the crowd mainly\ncomprised of Imperial students, there\nwas strong representation from all\nyears (especially the 5th year medics\nwho were out in force tearing up the\ndance floor.)\nTaking care of the music on the\nnight were Ministry of Sound\u2019s DJ\nTechnixx, K2 of the Notting Hills Arts\nClub and ICSM\u2019s own DJ Harrybo\nand Nazza T who has just released\nan album: Spot the Difference on\nXstreme Soundz record Label.\nThroughout the night the sounds of\nHip Hop, Soul and Bhangra were\npumped out as well as an inspired\ngarage/grime set resulting in an\nexplosion of severe dancing/rowdi-ness on the dance floor!\nIn traditional Twist style the\nevening included break dancing\nand street-locking performances\nby Caeser (look out for his dance\nclasses) and Ajay (ICSM) as well as\nan Open Mic Competition featuring\nthe likes of MC Menis, Sub Zero and\neven Harrybo blessing the mic with\nsome interesting lyrics to get the\ncrowd lively. Having advertised the\nevent on most of the major clubbing\nwebsites in London, we also saw a\ncouple of high profile photographers\ntaking photos on the night! Even Bob\nGeldoff decided to pop his head into\nthe venue! There were great drinks\npromos available and the Capisce air\nalso boasted a hint of flavour with shisha available throughout the venue.\nCongratulations to the International\nTamil Society Committee 06/07 and\nthe veterans Harrybo and Kris for\ncontinuing the success of Twist, hosting an excellent party and raising over\n600 pounds for worthy causes such\nas British Red Cross, Ramakrishna\nMission and Tamil Aid. Look out for\nour future Twists during next year\u2019s\nfresher\u2019s week.\nAnnakan Navaratnam\nTwist: Reloaded with IC Tamil Soc.\nTwo pages again today, which is\nstrange considering most people\nare not going out any more. Thank\nyou to the Tamil Society for sending\nin their review of Twist: Reloaded;\nbe sure to catch their next event.\nConor has been at it again this week,\nsampling the delights of Mayfair\nat the Ice Bar, making the most of\nthe \u00a3240 bar tab that they gave him\nfor writing the review. Felix must\nbe pretty highly regarded in those\ncircles.\nNo reviews from me this week,\nAnother double page spread. Conor at Ice Bar, IC\nTamil Soc at Twist and a stupid cliche article.\nyou\u2019ll have to wait a few weeks\nbefore you get any of the best\nmaterial we have to offer, which\nmeans we are still open to sug-gestions. I\u2019ve said it every week\nbefore so I\u2019ll say it again here,\nif you want to write a review for\nsomewhere just email me with\nyour preferences, I\u2019ll give you and\na friend a club to visit, some free\ndrinks, some money, a prostitute,\nand a miniature giraffe. It can be\nanything: Your favourite club, your\nworst club, your local crack broth-el. In fact, it doesn\u2019t even need to\nbe a review. You could write an\narticle on your favourite area for\npicking up hookers, or maybe an\nessay on how much you love me.\nI\u2019m open to suggestions.\nCongratulations to the winners\nof last week\u2019s prize. I\u2019m afraid\nthere is no competition this week\nas I didn\u2019t have time to organise\nthe prizes, but look out in future\nissues for our super sweet givea-ways: Probably more VIP tick-ets, or maybe something completely different, I have no idea.\nRemember if you don\u2019t enter then\nI\u2019ll just end up keeping them for\nmyself, or giving them to a tramp\nor some underage kids. Until next\ntime, have fun with revision.\nGreg Mead\nNightlife Editor\nNo sailor outfits in sight this time, but those coats do look rather dashing.\n\n"

I\ncompletely understand the former,\nthough, since his first album was cobbled together in a week and released\nwithout any fanfare on a little known\nlabel (Tomlab). Fans of the gay version of the Polyphonic Spree, the\nHidden Cameras, and those who\ndedicate themselves to every string\ncrescendo of Funeral by Arcade Fire\nwill have heard of this one man band.\nHe wrote string parts for both. Now\nyou are thinking you should\u2019ve heard\nof him sooner, aren\u2019t you? Well, \u201cyes\u201d\nis my answer.\nWhen he performs live, he does\nso with a violin, his voice, and a loop\npedal to create the backing. Now\nhe has a new album out. The more\norchestral, fuller-sounding (but tragically titled) He Poos Clouds. Buy it\n(when it finally comes our over here).\nDue to the nature of this album, I was\nunsure whether he would expand to\ninclude a quartet, or continue with his\n\u2018one man and his loop pedal\u2019 show. It\nturns out he stuck to the latter and it\nwas joyous, but first a few words on\nthe support acts.\nSimon Bookish is fantastically\nappalling. I can see what he is trying\nto do (one third Jarvis Cocker, one\nthird Richard Youngs, and one third\nRichard James) but falls flat and just\nirritates me.\nGrizzly Bear, from Brooklyn, are\nbrilliant with their charming, sparse,\nexperimental, heavily reverbed, and\nlooped alt-folk country with slo-core\n(I cannot believed I used said that)\nelements. It is beautiful stuff and no\ndescription I can muster will cover\nit.\nOwen Pallet arrives onto the stage\nwith violin in hand and launches into\nThe CN Tower Belongs to the Dead.\nA magnificent entry, I must say (as\nthe bishop said to the housemaid).\nHe proceded to impress the audience\nwith his mastery of his looping pedal\nduring new songs such as This Lamb\nsells Condos. This song is about a middle aged guy who can\u2019t perform in the\nunderwear department. Classic lines\ninclude, \u201cHis massive genitals refuse\nto co-operate/no amount of therapy\ncan now save his marriage.\u201d\nA new arrangement of This is the\nDream of Win and Regine was not as\nsuccessful or triumphant as I wanted\nit to be, with the drums letting it\ndown. It is odd that as soon as he\nadds elements, he takes away from\nthe performance. Also after professing that OMD (80\u2019s pop) were his\nfavourite British band, one of his\nencores feature two brilliant covers\n(with faithful schoolground noises).\nHis second and last encore then featured an attractive cover of Mariah\nCarey\u2019s Fantasy, featuring the lead\nsinger of Grizzly Bear, that had me\nsinging along and laughing, which is\nsimply a good thing.\nOwen Pallet has a geeky edge (he\nhas a song called 59 Man Points\nLeads to Many LIves) which is actually tolerable, and is the best thing\nnamed after a computer game. He\nmay remain in the shadow of the far\nbetter-known and accessible (some\nmay be offended by Pallet\u2019s lyrics\ndealing with homosexual themes)\nArcade Fire, but I hope this doesn\u2019t\nlast long.\nMatty Hoban\nLIVE REVIEW\nFInal Fantasy\nThe Luminaire\nKilburn\nH H H H H\nARE YOU READY TO LIVE LIFE?\nThe Isle of Wight offers a fantastic lifestyle to\nGraduates. Fast becoming one of the UK\u2019s cultural hotspots, with a large music scene including\nthe famous Nokia Isle of Wight Music Festival and\nthe Bestival.\nThe Isle of Wight offers excellent opportunities\nfor extreme watersports enthusiasts and hosts\nEurope\u2019s largest extreme watersports festival\n- White Air.\nPeople are able to take time chilling out, enjoying the beaches, restaurants, and pubs or being\na bit more active, trekking or cycling across our\nbeautiful countryside and rugged coastline; one\ncan really achieve the work\u2013life balance that so\nmany people aspire to.\nThe Isle of Wight has built up an enviable reputation as a place of excellence and innovation in\nthe fields of maritime and aerospace engineering\nand technology.
