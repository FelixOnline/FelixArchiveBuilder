The staff were kind and\nwelcoming, and I particularly noticed that they refilled\nthe water without being asked \u2013 a rare find in London\nrestaurants. The other guests \u2013 families with young\nchildren, girl friends out for dinner, and your typical\ncouples on date nights \u2013 all seemed content with their\nfood and were all deep in conversation.\nAs a group of six students, I was keen to get everyone\u2019s opinion on the food. The burger was deemed\n\u201cdelicious\u201d, but \u201cnot worth the price\u201d and it didn\u2019t fully\nsatisfy my friends. My own vegetarian dish \u2013 the butter beans on toast \u2013 was saved by leeks and cheddar\ncheese, as the sourdough bread was slightly charred\non one end. There aren\u2019t any vegan options on offer,\nbesides the usual chips. The chicken schnitzel seemed\nto be the best-rated option from our group\u2019s discussion\nof the food\nWe all thanked our friend H for introducing us to\nthis fine dining outlet. The staff, location, and food\ncomplemented the enjoyable conversation well, however we all agreed it isn\u2019t the best place for university\nstudents on a budget to enjoy a filling dinner. Nonetheless, I would still recommend Morty and Bob\u2019s for\nthose who love a classic cheesy beans on toast.\nMorty & Bob\u2019s: a prime\nexample of London\u2019s\noverpriced cuisine\nFOOD&TRAVEL\nFoodEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nCoal Drops Yard in King\u2019s Cross hosts many\nunique restaurants, among them the charming-yet-costly Morty & Bob\u2019s.\nDestroy H\u2019s favourite\nrestaurant for their\n\u00a315 beans on toast.\n\u201c\nBaader-Meinhof\nPhenomenon:\nbest observed in\nLondon\nLondon never ceases to\nprovide the group you\nseek to belong to.\nTravelEditor\nCHARLOTTE PROBSTEL\nButter beans on sourdough with cheddar cheese.

Pregnant\nwomen detect other pregnant women faster than the average person \u2013 because they subconsciously decide that\npregnancy is the most important thing in their life. This\nis called selective attention. Now, these women may then\nthink that the number of pregnancies has risen, even\nthough there hasn\u2019t been a real change. This is called\nconfirmation bias, and London \u2013 the international city\nwhere you can find almost any kind of person \u2013 is the\nbest place to experience it.\nI personally noticed the phenomenon as I was running\nlong-distance last weekend. I stumbled across at least\nsix different running groups during my usual Saturday\nmorning run. After the sixth group I stopped counting.\nI saw them everywhere: Westminster, Hyde Park, Regent\u2019s Park, and Chelsea. Similar to running into a flock\nof pigeons, chaos would ensue each time I noticed the\napproaching legion of Nike wearing soldiers.\nThat was not the only time this has happened; last\nSunday I met up with a friend to take a few photos around\nLondon. The abundance of tourists and locals with all\ntheir different professional cameras struck me. It was\nas if everyone that weekend had decided to go out to the\nThames to take pictures \u2013 but that is what confirmation\nbias is. I told my friend about my observation and he said\n\u201cI noticed that when I was looking for flats. I started seeing letting signs everywhere.\u201d\nI now aim to notice more things about London \u2013 without the bias of course, this is a STEM university after all.\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Editorial | 3\nISSUE #1842\nRevolving doors at ICU\nEDITORIAL\nI\nn 2022, Imperial carried out a review\nof its governance arrangements. It\nbrought on board a number of parties\nto help with the project: internal experts,\nmanagement consultants \u2013 and one Lloyd\nJames, who had just finished his term\nas President of Imperial College\nUnion (ICU).\nThe Union President wears\na number of hats, but the most\nintrinsic part of their job \u2013\ntogether with four\nother Officer Trustees\n\u2013 is to represent to the\nuniversity the interests\nof students.\nThere is no indication\nof impropriety on\nJames\u2019s part; indeed,\nhe has served the\nUnion in a multitude\nof roles since starting\nat Imperial in 2013. But\nhis work in the College\n\u2013 which commenced in\nthe very same month that he finished as\nPresident \u2013 is the most prominent example\nof Union sabbatical officers gliding from\nstudent rep roles and into jobs at Imperial.\nIt raises serious questions about\nthe ability of Officer Trustees (OTs) to\nrepresent students and brings to the fore\nthe age-old concept of \u2018revolving doors\u2019\n.\nHow can OTs credibly claim to represent\nstudents if they have a vested interest in\npleasing the College to get a\njob at Imperial?\nFor James, the problem is\nmore one of appearances than practical\nconflicts of interest. He says that his job\nat Imperial emerged as a possibility only\ntowards the end of his term as President,\nas the College started work on its\ngovernance review.\n\u201cI had worked quite closely with the\ngovernance team at Imperial, and it would\nbe a pain to bring new people in for a short-term project,\u201d he explains. He conducted\norganisational research, held discussions\nwith staff, and wrote briefing papers \u2013\n\u201cwork that benefitted from my background\nknowledge of governance arrangements\nwithin the College\u201d\n.\nSince leaving the College, James has\njoined a prestigious Magic Circle law firm\nthat pays its newly qualified solicitors six-figure salaries. However, he denies that\nhis governance role at Imperial played any\nsignificant role in him securing the law\ntraineeship.\nHe is keen to highlight the benefits of\nOTs taking on College roles, noting that\nthey bring with them a unique perspective,\nas former students themselves, and are\ninvested in improving the experience of\ncurrent students.\nFurthermore, James describes Imperial\nas a \u201chuge, siloed organisation\u201d, so that it\nis possible to have a cordial relationship\nwith one part of the institution, while being\nconfrontational \u2013 if so needed \u2013 with\nanother.\nNevertheless, there are legitimate\nconcerns to be had about the extent of the\nrevolving doors phenomenon at Imperial.\nAt least eight former OTs have joined the\nranks of College staff in the past decade\n\u2013 six of those eight joined within weeks\nor months of leaving elected office. And\nthough this does yield some advantages\nto both students and College, there are\nplausible scenarios in which the student\nvoice could be compromised.\nTake, for example, the Deputy President\n(Education), who might be required to\ntake up the case of an individual students\nwho is unhappy with how the College\nhas treated them. This could feasibly\nbring them into direct conflict with the\nCollege teams they wish to work for in\nfuture, forcing them to make a decision:\nwill they serve the interests\nof the student, or their\npotential employer?\nJames is right to\nunderscore how OTs\ncan improve the student\nexperience when given\njobsatImperial.Butperhaps\nthere is a middle ground that\nallows students to benefit\nfrom such arrangements while\navoiding \u2013 or at least mitigating\n\u2013 the conflicts of interest that arise from\nthem.\nIn government, ex-ministers must\nregister with the Advisory Committee on\nBusiness Appointments, which advises\nthem if they wish to take up external\nappointments within two years of leaving\noffice. This is admittedly excessive for a\nstudent union sabbatical role.\nA more reasonable alternative, this\nnewspaper proposes, is a cooling-off\nperiod of at least one year, during which\nOTs cannot join the College. It reduces\nthe chances that an OT\u2019s decision-making\nwill be swayed, while still allowing those\nwho are truly dedicated to improving the\nstudent experience to return to a job at\nImperial.\nHow can Officer\nTrustees credibly\nclaim to represent\nstudents, if\nthey have a\nvested interest\nin pleasing the\nCollege to get a\njob at Imperial?\n\u201c\n\n"

A few giant\nhouse spiders scuttle around in their\nsheet webs, a large brown centipede\nsprints for cover, and woodlice disperse\nin their characteristic animated fashion.\nJust as I put the stone down, however,\nI notice something strange. A thin, pale\nyellow creature shuffles away into a crevice in the stone, looking like a worm that\nspawned legs. Lots of legs. A closer look\nat this strange being reveals hundreds of\ntiny legs moving in almost perfect syn-chrony. Before I can even process what\u2019s\nhappening, it\u2019s gone. This ethereal beast\nis a soil centipede (order Geophilomorpha).\nCentipedes are putatively some of the\noldest known arthropods, first appearing in the fossil record over 400 million\nyears ago. Since then, years of form-fash-ion tango have resulted in many versions\nof the perfect predator, with evolutionary bells and whistles duly added to the\nfundamental template of legs, forcipules\n(bespoke front legs tailored to deliver a\nnoxious coup-de-grace), antennae, and\nvenom.\nGeophilomorphs, however, take spe-cialisation to the extreme. Geophilomorpha rather poetically translates to \u2018built\nto love the earth\u2019, and these animals truly underscore this epithet \u2014 with the\nexception of a few species, many cannot\neven be found during the day as they\nhide in the soil.\nBlindness is a common trait among\nanimals that have evolved to be subterranean (underground) or cavernicolous (in\ncaves) \u2014 when you rarely see light, the\nability to process it gradually turns from\noptional extra to a hindrance, superfluous enough to be tossed away entirely.\nCentipedes range in size from a few\nmillimetres to over a foot, with the largest species Scolopendra gigantea routinely hunting bats. Even among smaller representatives of this class, well-armoured\nand dangerous prey are nothing but a\nminor inconvenience.\nOne might think blindness would\npose a hindrance to obligate carnivores,\nbut soil centipedes seem none the worse\nfor it. I have had the privilege of watching them hunt in laboratory conditions,\nand while I\u2019ve never seen the actual kill,\nthe one thing that is clear beyond doubt\nis their complete reliance on their sensitive antennae to detect smaller invertebrates running around in the soil.\nIn a macabre twist, they seem to have\na peculiar method of consuming their\nprey \u2013 tunnelling through and eating\nfrom the inside out, leaving an almost\nperfect husk of their unfortunate victim\nas a calling card.\nThe UK has 25 species of geophilo-morphs, many of which can be found\neven in and around human habitation.\nOne way to distinguish geophilo-morphs from other centipede orders is\ntheir leg count \u2013 while other orders have\na fixed number of legs, geophilomorphs\nmay show both inter- and intra-specific\nvariation, even going as far as displaying\nsexual dimorphism in some cases.\nSome geophilomorph families casually walk around with 200 leg pairs,\nbut nobody knows for certain what the\nadvantage is.

These programmes\nhave largely been successful and have\nresulted in a huge short-term boost in\nlocal renewable-energy capacity.\nHowever, the government is looking\nto decrease the programme\u2019s reliance\non subsidies and instead incentivise\nfuture installations\nby other means.\nThere is also a need\nto improve solar-energy storage and\nutilisation for purposes such as heating\nand electric vehicles, to further reduce\nreliance on fossil fuels in the long term.\nChina has also ramped up its PV\ncell production in the past few years,\nto meet the rising global demand for\nefficient solar-energy technology. The\ncountry currently manufactures most\nof the silicon wafers and PV cells on the\nmarket today, exporting them all around\nthe world, primarily to the US, India,\nAustralia, and Germany.\nAnother novel solution for finding\nsufficient land for solar-energy\nproduction is agrivoltaics: combining\nsolar farms with active agricultural\nfarms by installing solar panels over the\ntop of land that is being used to grow\ncrops or rear livestock. This utilises land\nthat has already been exploited for food\nproduction, avoiding further conversion\nof land into the flat, open spaces\nnecessary for solar farms. Agrivoltaics\nallow agricultural activity to continue as\nnormal, and even provide benefits such\nas mitigating heat stress on crops and\nprotecting them from severe weather.\nGreenhouses can even be constructed\nwith inbuilt semi-transparent PV cells.\nAgrivoltaics could greatly accelerate\nthe push to clean energy, particularly\nin Europe and South America, where\nagriculture accounts for a large portion\nof land use. As is the case in China\u2019s rural\ncommunities, any electricity produced\nby agrivoltaics can be sold to the main\nenergy grid, creating an extra source of\nincome for the landowner.\nThis can be seen in France, where the\nsolar-energy company TSE is supporting\nfarmers incorporating agrivoltaics\ninto their existing infrastructure.\nThe company designs solar-panel\ninstallations that won\u2019t hinder\nagricultural practices such as livestock\nrearing and crop harvesting using\nmachines, to ensure productivity levels\nare maintained.\nThough the increasing production\ncapacity and price fall of solar energy is\nbeing mirrored in other energy sources\nsuch as wind and hydroelectric, energy\nsecurity remains the largest barrier to\nreducing reliance on non-renewable\nsources. However, for solar energy, it\u2019s\nnot just the variability of weather that\nlimits its potential for widespread use;\nthe industry\u2019s reliance on China for\nmanufacturing and provisioning of raw\nmaterials \u2013 such as silver and silicon \u2013\nruns the risk of creating monopolies.\nThis could result in hiked-up prices in\nthe face of increased demand.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n18 | Books 9 February 2024\nL\nong-time readers of Felix may know my favourite\nauthor to be Virginia Woolf, because of the absolute\nbeauty and expressionism that is imbued across all\nher works (evidence of this is in issue #1813). However, I\nhave always maintained, above all else, that Fyodor Dostoevsky is the author you must read before you die.\nBorn in Russia in 1821, Dostoevsky lived through a\ntime of great change and political turmoil, as liberal and\nMarxist ideals began to overtake Europe and Russia began its attempts to modernise, in competition with the\nindustrialised West. Focused on the human condition,\nas well as delving deep to the realms of politics and phi-losophy, Dostoevsky is remarkable in how dazzlingly\nvaried his oeuvre is, despite his studying as an engineer.\nTrying to read Dostoevsky is an intimidating task as\na lot of his novels are several hundred pages in length\n\u2013 many stand at approximately 600 pages. In addition,\nto truly get Dostoevsky, one must have a pretty good\nunderstanding of the febrile sociopolitical conditions\nwithin nineteenth-century Russia: the rise of radical\nanti-tsarists, the emancipation of the serf class into\npeasants, and a policy of Russification towards the\ncountry\u2019s Slavic neighbours.\nThis extends to key events in Dostoevsky\u2019s life, including his miraculous reprieve from being executed\nvia shooting due to his involvement with the socialist\nPetrashevsky literary circle. Facing constant repression\nfrom the autocratic tsarist regime, several of Dostoevsky\u2019s journalistic endeavours were censored and can-celled, and a gambling addiction led to poverty trailing\nthe latter section of his life.\nDostoevsky wrote in his native Russian, and to get\na solid grasp of his works, a decent translation is nec-essary. Most translations sold today are good, however\nfor Crime and Punishment, I would recommend Oliver\nReady\u2019s translation. It\u2019s written with the intention of\nproviding all the characters with a unique narrative\nvoice, including Russian grammar that dramatically alters how in particular the poor speak. It helps give the\nnovel a much better voice than a formal, stiff translation\nwould.\nI also recommend the Penguin Modern Classics\n(black with orange highlights) as they come with a timeline of Dostoevsky\u2019s life, key events, and footnotes that\nare perfect to catching the subtle humour that Fyodor\nsneaks in throughout his fiction. These aren\u2019t cheap on\na student budget, but you can find decent second-hand\ncopies for very cheap at charity shops.\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll need is peace and\nquiet. A Dostoevsky is not the type of book you take on\nyour commute: you\u2019ll be likely to get lost in its pages and\nwon\u2019t have a clue on what\u2019s going on. It might be a good\nidea to keep notes, or at least record which character is\nwhich, given the long Russian names, nicknames, and\npatronyms of each one.\nDostoevsky is to be enjoyed in the snobbiest and most\npretentious way possible, sort of like coffee. You have to\ninvest your time and energy into it. However, the payoff\nthat comes afterwards is immensely great. It changes\nthe way you think, alters how you view the world, and\nmakes you consider life in just a slightly different light.\nAnintricateintroductionto\nreadingDostoevsky\nBOOKS\nBooksEditor\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nOur Books editor elaborates on how best to enjoy\none of the greatest masters of the page.\nDostoevsky is to be enjoyed\nin the snobbiest and most\npretentious way possible,\nsort of like coffee.\n\u201c\nFacing constant repression\nfrom the autocratic\ntsarist regime, several of\nDostoevsky\u2019s journalistic\nendeavours were censored\nand cancelled.\n\u201c\n\n"

It\u2019s incredible that his third\nstudio album, What Happened to the Beach?\n(WHTTB?), has managed to break even\nmore ground in terms of experimentali-ty than his previous releases. WHTTB? is\nset to be released on 9th\nFebruary (today if\nyou\u2019re reading this on publishing day), and\nI couldn\u2019t be more excited to listen through\nit to my heart\u2019s content.\nThe only singles released prior to the\nalbum were \u2018Sympathy\u2019 and \u2018Nothing Works\u2019,\nas well as an EP featuring \u2018Mulholland\u2019s Dinner and Wine\u2019 and \u2018Elevator Hum\u2019. While the\nsingles are both brilliant\ntracks and epitomise the\nstyle of WHTTB?, I think\nit\u2019s fair to say that they\nstill only scratch the surface of what McKenna\nhas achieved with the\nrest of the album, which\nI had the privilege of being granted early access\nto.\nTonally, WHTTB?\nsounds a lot like some\nof the psychedelic-punk\ntracks of the \u201880s \u2013 think\nDavid Bowie or Joy Division \u2013 making liberal use\nof vocal distortion and\na huge range of instruments to create McKenna\u2019s desired whimsical\nfeel. \u2018Phantom Buzz (Kick\nIn)\u2019 is a prime example\nof this, and it takes a\ncertain skill to produce\nthe kinds of comforta-ble-yet-eclectic compositions that can appeal\nboth to the alternative\nand indie crowds, and to the mainstream pop\nmarket.\nThere\u2019s a roughness around the edges to\ntracks like \u2018WOBBLE\u2019 and \u2018I Write the News\u2019\nthat strongly resemble some of The Beatles\n(White Album) tracks. Even in numbers like\n\u2018Mezzanine\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s an Act\u2019, which are a bit\nslower and easier to listen to, the experimental streak is maintained, reminiscent of some\nof the tracks on Harry\u2019s House but executed\nwith a little more finesse.\nThere are some evidently personal themes\nrunning through the album \u2013 on \u2018Nothing\nWorks\u2019, McKenna sings about the feeling of\nquickly becoming obsolete while still having\nlots to offer. It\u2019s also a commentary on his\nartistic freedom; in a similar vein lyrically to\nArctic Monkeys\u2019 \u2018Teddy Picker\u2019. He also hints\nat the incessant badgering and verbal conflict that plays out in the media. While several tracks clearly take inspiration from his\ntime living in Los Angeles, a thread of British\ncynicism continues to run through his lyr-ics, at times clearly taking digs at the state of\nglobal affairs over the last few years, just as in\nhis previous two albums.\nTo end on a brief tangent, I\u2019ve recently\nbeen opting to listen through albums over\nplaylists, which often makes for a more\nstructured and rounded out listening expe-rience. WHTTB? is definitely one of those albums that will take you on the scenic route\nthrough the mind of the artist, so be sure to\ncheck it out!\nMcKenna and his band are on tour in the\nUK throughout late March and most of April,\nthough tickets for many of his shows are already selling out, so if you\u2019re a fan of his music grab tickets while they\u2019re still available.\nDeclan McKenna plays Alexandra Palace on 12th\nApril 2024.\nFelix Music got an early listen\nof Declan McKenna\u2019s highly\nanticipated indie-pop album, What\nHappened to the Beach?\nDeclan McKenna has a\nGenuine Question\nMusicWriter\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nCover of Declan McKenna\u2019s album, What Happened to the Beach?, released on 9th\nFebruary, 2024.\nMUSIC\n\n"

The energy\ngeneration itself is performed by\nphotovoltaic (PV) cells, which are a kind\nof semiconductor device that converts\nlight directly into electricity. When\nlight is shone upon the semiconducting\nsilicon in a PV cell, a flow of electrons is induced in the material. This\nmovement of electrons creates a voltage\npotential that generates electricity,\nwhich can either charge up batteries or\nbe connected directly to an electrical\nnetwork.\nSolar is currently the cheapest form of\nenergy on the market. Its price dropped\nby 82% between 2010 and 2022. This\nwas driven by increased demand and\nimprovements in PV-cell technology.\nSolar panels are also cheap and easy to\ninstall, operate, and maintain.\nThe perovskite\u2013silicon \u2018tandem\u2019\ndesign for PV cells is a relatively novel\ntechnology. This design has increased\ncell efficiency over the current silicon\ncells, which will further improve the\ncost-effectiveness of solar energy. The\nterm \u2018perovskite\u2019 refers to a particular\nABX3 crystal structure. By changing\nthe composition of the lead halide\nperovskites used in tandem cells, they\ncan be tuned to respond to different\nparts of the electromagnetic spectrum\ncompared with the frequencies that\nsimple silicon cells do. This allows for a\ngreater efficiency in power conversion\nby utilising more of the incoming light.\nTandem PV cells are yet to be widely\ncommercialised, but when they do reach\nthe market, we can expect further drops\nin the price of solar-energy generation.\nSolar energy is arguably the least\nobtrusive renewable energy source and\none of the most durable; the average\nlifetime of a solar-panel system is 25-30 years. Although some individual\ncomponents \u2013 such as solar inverters\n\u2013 last only about half this time, they\nare easy to replace, and operation can\ncontinue as normal. Because solar\npanels only consist of aluminium, glass,\nand isolated electronic components,\nthey can also easily be recycled.\nThere is a huge degree of variability in\nsolar-energy generation \u2013 electricity can\nonly be generated during the day when\nthe Sun is out, and this is dependent on\nhaving clear weather conditions and\na sufficient amount of unshaded land.\nThis necessitates either backup forms\nof power generation (usually fossil-fuel\nbased) or robust energy storage, which\nis tricky to achieve at a large scale with\nelectrical batteries. This lack of energy\nsecurity is one of the biggest barriers to\nmaking a full transition to solar power.\nAnother major challenge in\nincreasing solar capacity has been\nfinding appropriate spaces in which to\ninstall the infrastructure. In urban areas,\nrooftop solar panels have been the most\neffective answer to this \u2013 a rooftop installation can typically generate enough\nenergy for a house, allowing it to be\ndisconnected from the main energy\ngrid. The panels are also relatively\ncheap and easy to install; for an average\nhousehold in the UK, the necessary 4kW\nsystem costs around \u00a37,000 and can be\nset up in a couple of days.\nChina has recently come to the\nforefront of solar-energy generation,\nhaving nearly doubled its capacity\nbetween 2019 and 2022. Focus has been\nshifted from large-scale solar farms to\nsmaller-scaledistributedprojects,which\nrefers primarily to rooftop installations.\nThe country has run two major\ni n c e n t i v i s a t i o n\nschemes: the 2014\nSolar Energy\nSolar system\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0018\u0019\n\n"

We are looking for environmentally-conscious students with good writing and design skills\nto replace us as section editors for 2024/25.\nBeing a Felix Environment editor has been the highlight of my time at Imperial. I thought I would share\nsome of the reasons why here. I hope they inspire you to\njoin our team this autumn.\nI have learnt transferable skills\nEvery job and further study position looks for verbal\nand written communication, and being a section editor\nteaches both. I enjoy the challenge of communicating\ncomplex science and policies in simple English, and I\nappreciate the intense scrutiny for spelling, punctua-tion, and grammar at Felix. Nearly every week, I need\nto write professional emails to important people I have\nnever met \u2013 and sometimes have spoken conversations\nwith them. I have used this experience to approach and\nspeak to many potential postgraduate supervisors.\nI also learnt how to use Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, so could become a graphic designer if my research\ncareer does not work out!\nI meet really cool people\nOutside of Imperial, I have interviewed the Secretary-General of CITES (Issue #1822) and the General\nManager of Moody\u2019s Analytics (Issue #1837). I currently\nhave an interview lined up with someone from Rainforest Foundation UK. All of these people have inspiring career paths, and it is truly an honour to hear from them,\nand to share their wisdom with Imperial\u2019s student body.\nThrough my role, I have received exclusive insights\ninto the world of sustainability as it manifests itself at\nImperial. The environment has increasingly infiltrated minds and policies at Imperial since I joined Felix,\nmaking this is an exciting section to edit. Sustainability Week last year was my favourite week at Imperial \u2013\nthrough my coverage for Felix, I got to meet the students\nand staff making the campus and planet greener.\nSimilarly, I enjoyed speaking to the founders of Towards Net Zero (Issue #1827) and SustainaPod (this is-sue) \u2013 both of whom are Imperial students \u2013 about their\ndreams of educating young people about sustainability.\nIt is mind-blowing how hard both these students\nwork on their degree and their side project.\nI get to cover exciting stories\nThe best part of this job is covering stories that matter\nto students, staff, and alumni. Take my investigation\ninto fossil fuel companies sponsoring the Science Museum (Issues #1829-30). I extensively researched the\nissue, interviewed important stakeholders, and gauged\nstudents\u2019 attitudes on fossil fuel sponsorship. Although\nthis took up more brain space than my degree in October, I lived for the thrill of contrasting opinions and bold\naccusations. I also received valuable journalism train-ing, learning terms like \u2018right of reply\u2019 and \u2018libel\u2019.\nEveryone is super nice\nFelix is active as a student society, and their social events\nare a great way to relax after a hard day\u2019s work. From my\nexperience, the other section editors are very helpful\nwhen it comes to journalism techniques and InDesign\ntips. They are equally as good at having ethical discussions as they are telling jokes, which makes working in\nthe office so much fun.\nHow to become a section editor\nIf this article has convinced you to become a Felix Environment editor, my co-editor and I are looking for reporters to cover Sustainability Fortnight this year (19th\nFebruary to 1st\nMarch).\nSustainability Week will be a great opportunity for\npotential editors to learn what the role is like. Reporters\nwill attend events, take or source pictures, write articles,\nand/or lay articles out on InDesign \u2013 we will help you\nout each step of the way.\nEmail us at environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk to\nlearn more.\nEnvironmentEditor\nSIMRAN PATEL\nFelix Environment is looking for editors for the 2024/25 academic year.\nHere\u2019s why you should be one.\nI got to attend this event on eco-anxiety for Sustainability Week\n2023! Simran Patel\nI enjoy making striking graphics about striking news stories \u2013 like\nthis one about Science Museum sponsorships. Simran Patel\n\n"

The 17 goals\nfocus on the environment, economy, social issues and\nmore, and are by nature, interlinked.\nWe, your Officer Trustees, saw this as a valuable\nopportunity to bring together the many individuals and\ndepartments within Imperial, that are passionate about\nsustainability, and collectively work towards the delivery\nof a meaningful event.\nImperial was selected by the collaborating universities\nto host LSSC 2024, and planning has been underway\nsince. I have been the main point of coordination for\nthe conference from within the Union, with backing\nand support from the Imperial Sustainability Hub,\nthe Grantham Institute, and senior leaders within the\nCollege.\nWithin the College, the Education Office is running\na project to map the UN SDGs to all curricula across\ndepartments and degrees. If you are interested in hearing\nmore, or helping with the project, please contact the\nproject lead Mike Tennant (m.tennant@imperial.ac.uk).\nBehind the scenes\nIt takes a village to deliver a conference. This village\nincludes the many staff and students from our\ncollaborating universities, each of them playing different\nroles to realise LSSC 2024.\nOne of the key players behind the scenes is our Student\nDelivery Group, formed and led by students to take upon\nthe challenges and responsibilities required to deliver\nLSSC 2024.\nMarios Fokas Tsamichas, Imperial Business School\nalumnus and a current UCL student at the Bartlett School\nof Environment, Energy, and Resources, has been actively\ninvolved in the Student Delivery Group\u2019s work.\nHe has found it extremely rewarding to \u201cassist experts\non the coordination and delivery of one of workshops\u201d, as\nwellastheopportunityto\u201cchairthepresentationsessions\u201d\nan invaluable experience. Marios has also been working\nclosely with me to organise the conference logistics to\nensure a smooth experience for our participants.\nOverall, Marios shares that he has \u201cfound this\nconference to be a vital opportunity for London\nstudents, such as myself, to delve into and engage with\nsustainability issues, and I highly recommend that\nanyone who\u2019s eager to take part in the conversation on\nenvironmental progress and development join us at the\nconference this year and beyond!\u201d\nJoin us!\nLSSC 2024 has a packed agenda that will feature:\n\u2022 Welcome Address: Keynote speeches from\nHarriet Wallace (Sustainability Strategy Director at\nImperial), and Dr Omnia El Omrani (Climate Change and\nHealth Junior Policy Fellow at Imperial)\n\u2022 Presentations & Posters: A showcase of students\u2019\nideas, projects, and research relating to the UN SDGs\n\u2022 Interactive Workshops: Engage in discussions\nreflecting on circular economies, net-zero pathways,\nclimate justice, and more ...\n\u2022 Networking Event: Connect with students,\nacademics and professionals from universities across\nLondon\nI highly encourage you to join us at the conference and\nhear from your peers about their projects and to become\ninspired by their innovations.

The last time that Apple launched\na new category of products was all the way back in 2015\nwith the Apple Watch. Apple has already sold upwards\nof 200,000 headsets according to MacRumors, within\njust over a week of launching in the US, and they are\npredicted to hit 600,000 sales by the end of this year.\nFirst of its kind\nThe Vision Pro is a first-generation product, and it has\nall the characteristics of one. There are some things it\ndoes extremely well, putting it leagues ahead of anything else on the market, but there are also a few massive flaws. It\u2019s heavy, the battery life is short, some of its\nfeatures are borderline unfinished \u2013 but this is part of\nwhat makes it so exciting. 10 years down the line, will\nthis piece of technology have changed the way we live?\nUnlike Meta\u2019s Quest headset, which is widely used\nfor gaming, the Vision Pro markets itself as a \u201cspatial\ncomputer\u201d, but what is its actual use? At this moment,\nit doesn\u2019t seem to have a clear use case. However, that\ndoesn\u2019t stop it from having a suite of super cool features,\na few of which we\u2019ll explore.\nVision Pro features\nThe Vision Pro can connect to your MacBook and allow\nyou to have a virtual display of the Mac\u2019s screen, meaning you can create a portable multi-screen workspace.\nAt its core, the Vision Pro is a virtual and augmented\nreality headset, allowing you to bring virtual objects to\nyour space, and to take you to other environments. So\nnow you can video call on a theatre-sized screen or explore the surface of the Moon.\nThe headset can scan your face and create a hyper-re-alistic three-dimensional \u2018persona\u2019, which you can use\nas a representation of yourself during FaceTime calls.\nDeveloping technology\nApple says the feature is in beta right now so these examples appear pretty weird. Regardless, think about\nwhat could happen as it develops \u2013 imagine a future\nwhere you can video call someone and have a life-like\nhologram of them right beside you? Maybe the headset\nwill help us spend time together with our loved ones,\nrather than transforming the world into a frightening\ndystopian future.\nAfter changing its name from Facebook to Meta,\nmany thought that the metaverse would be the future of\nvirtual worlds. But in 2022, Meta\u2019s Reality Labs division\nlost $13.7bn, and Meta began to refocus its efforts on AI,\nwhich seemed much more exciting. But over the past\nyear, Zuckerberg\u2019s vision for the metaverse has shifted from fully immersive towards something that feels\nmuch more like augmented reality.\nNow with the release of the Vision Pro, Meta believes\nit will help increase the sales of its own range of VR\nheadsets, notably the Quest and the Quest Pro. One of\nthe differences of the Vision Pro as opposed to the fully immersive Meta headsets, is that simply twisting the\ndigital crown on the top of the Vision Pro allows you to\nadjust your immersion in the virtual world.\nThe dawn of spatial computing\nBeing the first spatial computer, the\nApple Vision Pro is a major leap into a new class of de-vice. At the Vision Pro\u2019s release, Tim Cook announced,\n\u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era of computing\u201d.\nVisionOS, the world\u2019s first spatial operating system, is going to be continuously improved by Apple and the developers who will\nbuild apps using it.\nAnd though it may currently seem ridiculous for people to be wandering around wearing the Vision Pro, this\nmay become the new reality \u2013 a hybrid between the real\nand virtual worlds.\nIt is an exciting future, but to gain more widespread\nadoption, the Vision Pro\u2019s price tag will need to be drastically reduced, and a strong developer community must\nform to build compatible apps.\nExploring Apple\u2019s vision with the\nVision Pro\nSCIENCE\nScienceWriter\nCHARLES CALZIA\nApple\u2019s Vision Pro is\nthe company\u2019s first-of-its-kind product launch\nand here is why we are\nso excited for it.\nTop: Apple Vision Pro logo.\nBottom: The outer glass of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWikimedia Commons\nScienceWriter\nTANISH BANSALL\nAs the first spatial computer,\nthe Apple Vision Pro is a\nmajor leap into a new class\nof device.\n\u201c\n\n"

As clich\u00e9 as it sounds, it\nis only in the absence of something that\nwe understand the meaning of its pres-ence. \u2018Only miss the sun when it starts\nto snow\u2026\u2019, as the song goes. I believe it\nis at those very moments when we ask\nourselves the age-old questions: \u2018what to\nlive for?\u2019, or, \u2018why get up in the morning\nat all?\u2019. Finding an answer to these questions means escaping a nihilistic, narrow\nview of life and accepting that although\nno answer is certain, and few are given,\nwe must create the rest.\nHow can we ask ourselves such profound questions through photography?\nOne possible answer is what Natalia encapsulates in this week\u2019s winning photo:\nwesimplydon\u2019taskourselves.Weinstead\nget our subject to pose the question. By\ndepicting the process of questioning and\nnot showing us a definite answer, I think\nNatalia is saying that not even the all-see-ing photographer can answer such existential questions, and we must find solace despite this unanswerable dilemma.\nThe harsh daylight in Predecessors almost completely removes shadows from\nthe environment, and I commend Natalia for shooting in what is typically a difficult lighting situation. The only visible\nshadow \u2013 the soldier\u2019s \u2013 is sharp and dis-tinct, as are the other shapes in this com-position. Perhaps I was initially attracted\nto this picture because of the contrast between the vagueness, and dare I say futil-ity, of this week\u2019s theme and the perfectly\ndefined contours and colours of the pho-to. There is no hidden subject, haze, fog,\nor indecisiveness in the photo, and yet\nthe question remains unanswered.\nI always find it an interesting exercise\nto imagine oneself as the subject of a photo \u2013 in this case, the mourning soldier.\nFor him, walking has a different meaning\nthan usual, less about moving from one\nplace to another and more about reliving\ncertain moments and desperately trying\nto answer the question of \u2018what to live\nfor?\u2019. Passing by so many other lost lives,\nthe soldier might start to think the question has been posed incorrectly. It\u2019s not\n\u2018what should I live for?\u2019, it\u2019s \u2018what do I live\nfor?\u2019, as we turn to others for an answer.\nWe are not alone in this endeavour, lest\nwe forget that others have also lived and\nall our lives are profoundly intertwined\nin such a way that maybe the question\nchanges once again, and the soldier is\nnow asking \u2018who to live for?\u2019.\nAs I finish writing this piece I realise that maybe Natalia did answer\nthis question, in a sort of roundabout,\nfootnote-like way. The title of the photo is\nPredecessors, which is a term that evokes\nin me a sense of duty and responsibili-ty. It makes me think that, although our\nancestors couldn\u2019t have answered the\nquestion \u2018who to live for?\u2019, we can now\ndo so for them: \u2018for me\u2019. As I put the living\u2019s ego above all else, I suggest that we\nare the reasons the people before us have\nlived and that we should try more to give\nmeaning to their lives than our own. In\nthe same way, many years from now, our\ndescendants might also give us meaning.\nWhat to live for\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nHeadPhotographer\nROLANDO CHARLES\nPredecessors: loss, responsibility, and what it means to be alive.\nScan the QR code to\nsubmit for the next\ntheme \u2018Sonder\u2018:\nPredecessors Natalia Kubica\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n18 | Books 9 February 2024\nL\nong-time readers of Felix may know my favourite\nauthor to be Virginia Woolf, because of the absolute\nbeauty and expressionism that is imbued across all\nher works (evidence of this is in issue #1813). However, I\nhave always maintained, above all else, that Fyodor Dostoevsky is the author you must read before you die.\nBorn in Russia in 1821, Dostoevsky lived through a\ntime of great change and political turmoil, as liberal and\nMarxist ideals began to overtake Europe and Russia began its attempts to modernise, in competition with the\nindustrialised West. Focused on the human condition,\nas well as delving deep to the realms of politics and phi-losophy, Dostoevsky is remarkable in how dazzlingly\nvaried his oeuvre is, despite his studying as an engineer.\nTrying to read Dostoevsky is an intimidating task as\na lot of his novels are several hundred pages in length\n\u2013 many stand at approximately 600 pages. In addition,\nto truly get Dostoevsky, one must have a pretty good\nunderstanding of the febrile sociopolitical conditions\nwithin nineteenth-century Russia: the rise of radical\nanti-tsarists, the emancipation of the serf class into\npeasants, and a policy of Russification towards the\ncountry\u2019s Slavic neighbours.\nThis extends to key events in Dostoevsky\u2019s life, including his miraculous reprieve from being executed\nvia shooting due to his involvement with the socialist\nPetrashevsky literary circle. Facing constant repression\nfrom the autocratic tsarist regime, several of Dostoevsky\u2019s journalistic endeavours were censored and can-celled, and a gambling addiction led to poverty trailing\nthe latter section of his life.\nDostoevsky wrote in his native Russian, and to get\na solid grasp of his works, a decent translation is nec-essary. Most translations sold today are good, however\nfor Crime and Punishment, I would recommend Oliver\nReady\u2019s translation. It\u2019s written with the intention of\nproviding all the characters with a unique narrative\nvoice, including Russian grammar that dramatically alters how in particular the poor speak. It helps give the\nnovel a much better voice than a formal, stiff translation\nwould.\nI also recommend the Penguin Modern Classics\n(black with orange highlights) as they come with a timeline of Dostoevsky\u2019s life, key events, and footnotes that\nare perfect to catching the subtle humour that Fyodor\nsneaks in throughout his fiction. These aren\u2019t cheap on\na student budget, but you can find decent second-hand\ncopies for very cheap at charity shops.\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll need is peace and\nquiet. A Dostoevsky is not the type of book you take on\nyour commute: you\u2019ll be likely to get lost in its pages and\nwon\u2019t have a clue on what\u2019s going on. It might be a good\nidea to keep notes, or at least record which character is\nwhich, given the long Russian names, nicknames, and\npatronyms of each one.\nDostoevsky is to be enjoyed in the snobbiest and most\npretentious way possible, sort of like coffee. You have to\ninvest your time and energy into it. However, the payoff\nthat comes afterwards is immensely great. It changes\nthe way you think, alters how you view the world, and\nmakes you consider life in just a slightly different light.\nAnintricateintroductionto\nreadingDostoevsky\nBOOKS\nBooksEditor\nMOHAMMAD MAJLISI\nOur Books editor elaborates on how best to enjoy\none of the greatest masters of the page.\nDostoevsky is to be enjoyed\nin the snobbiest and most\npretentious way possible,\nsort of like coffee.\n\u201c\nFacing constant repression\nfrom the autocratic\ntsarist regime, several of\nDostoevsky\u2019s journalistic\nendeavours were censored\nand cancelled.\n\u201c\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n16 | COmment 9 february 2024\nI\ncame to Imperial from Hong Kong for my BSc in\nBiology back in 2011. Closeted, with an engrained\ninternalised homophobia instilled by a deeply\nreligious school, and a Hong Kong society that was (and\nin some ways still is) lagging behind most of the Western\nworld by 20 years on acceptance of LGBTQ+, I was na\u00efve\nand ignorant.\nMy first introduction began on my very first day at Imperial. Having missed a group meeting with my personal\ntutor Dr Steve Cook, I ended up having a one-on-one chat\nwith him. Through the meeting, I was nervous \u2013 until the\nmoment he mentioned his husband in the most casual\nway during our conversation. The concept was so alien\nto me at the time that my brain froze. I remember I just\ndid my best to act as if it was normal (which it is!). Over\nthe course of first year, during which Steve gave many of\nthe lectures for biologists, we found that he took every\nopportunity to mention his husband in almost every\nlecture. The normalisation of the concept helped me\nimmensely with my own changing attitudes towards my\nidentity: from a misguided and self-critical state to being\nable to fully embrace my true self.\nAfter my undergraduate degree, I stayed on at Imperial for an MRes working on microbiome research, which\nI then followed up with a PhD on metabolic profiling for\nthe early detection of primary liver cancer. In the first\nyear of my PhD, I went to see London Pride for the first\ntime. It was an eye-opening experience. However, at the\ntime, I had never openly discussed the topic of LGBTQ+\nwith friends, let alone come out to them, and so I went\non my own. Eventually, I began talking about it more frequently and in greater detail with friends in London as\nwell as in Hong Kong, and I found \u2013 much to my surprise\n\u2013 that they were all extremely supportive. Around the\nsame time, the Imperial 600 network, which was founded in 2006 as a network for the LGBTQ+ staff and post-graduates, began to mature. Through them, I joined the\nLondon Pride march twice in subsequent years. Actually\nbeing in the march was a truly remarkable experience.\nOver the years, I have met many teaching staff and\npeers proudly being themselves, acting as role models\nor supporting the community as allies. I particularly enjoyed the sight of Queen\u2019s Tower lit up in rainbow\ncolours during Pride History Month in February and\nPride Month in July (tip: you can get a brilliant view of\nQueen\u2019s Tower from the top floor of SAF). It is these little\nthings that led to the most prized moments of joy for me.\nThe years I spent at Imperial were a period of\nmarked transformative self-discovery: from first coming out to family and friends as lesbian, to eventually\nunderstanding and realising that I identify as trans,\nthe inclusive environment here provided the necessary\ncondition for me to discover who I am. And throughout\nall this time, I was being supported by peers and teaching\nstaff at Imperial. Thanks to my experiences, I genuinely\nbelieve that Imperial is a fantastic workplace for anyone\nwho identifies as a member of the LGBTQ+ community.\nI recently attended my PhD graduation, and I am\nimmensely grateful for my time at Imperial, with the\nLGBTQ+ experiences among the most memorable\nhighlights. I wish to pay this back by acting as a role\nmodel and advocating for a more inclusive society.\nIn honour of LGBTQ+ History\nMonth: My Story\nCOMMENT\nCommentWriter\nABELLONA U\nImperial graduate Abellona U reflects back on\nhis formative experiences at Imperial.\nJoining London Pride March with Imperial 600 in 2019 Abellona U\n\n"

Finally, Ebee\nLee is one of my best friends and wants to gain greater\nexposure to sustainable careers. The good thing about\na team of first-years is we\u2019re all willing to explore new\nthings.\nWhat has been your biggest achievement in the last\nfour years?\nOne of my biggest personal achievements was an episode with the Vice-President of the Institute of Structural Engineering, Dr Elisabeth Marlow \u2013 as a civil engineer\nmyself, that was special. I also did an episode with someone who was working with DALL-E, developed by OpenAI. A third achievement was that two years ago, I did\nan interview with The Tyre Collective \u2013 a start-up which\nbegan as a master\u2019s project at Imperial. Now being at Imperial and being part of the Climate Entrepreneurs Club\nPre-Accelerator is kind of a full circle moment for me.\nWhat is the Climate Entrepreneurs Club Pre-Accelerator?\nThe Climate Entrepreneurs Club\u2019s Pre-Accelerator is a competition which\ncreates and develops climate start-ups. Teams\nare split into\nbuilders and\nideators. We\nhave Sust a i n a -P o d\na n d\nare\ntry-i n g\ntoscale\nup its\nimpact and\nsecure more\nfunding to support our work, so\nwe\u2019re part of the builders group. An ideator would be\nsomeone finding an idea and a group to\nbeginastartup.Wethentrytopitchtheideatomen-tors and hopefully win a cash prize.\nHow are you finding the Pre-Accelerator?\nI\u2019m very optimistic. I have been publishing each phase\nof the competition on social media because here at SustainaPod we believe it\u2019s the journey that counts. I\u2019m going to continue to show people what we\u2019re doing and see\nwhat comes of it. Hopefully this continues to build up\nour presence on campus and our community.\nAs I\u2019m a first-year and don\u2019t have the knowledge of\nfourth-years or PhD students. I\u2019m going through the\ncompetition with a humble and open-minded approach,\ntrying to learn from everyone. We\u2019re just going to put\nour best foot forward and see what happens. I\u2019m looking forward for the remaining stages of the competition.\nShould you win the competition, what will be the\nfirst thing you invest in?\nIf we do win that money, it\u2019s going straight into our\nfunds. We are trying to build a community, invest in\nmore equipment, and fund in-person events \u2013 because\nso far most of our work has been online through the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nOur only in-person event was held at Hong Kong University with Sally Ho, a radio host and reporter from my\nlocal radio platform RTHK. We all care about sustainability but there\u2019s a vast majority of people that don\u2019t.\nEither they don\u2019t know enough about sustainability, or\nthey know and don\u2019t care. The event asked how we can\nbring meaningful conversations to our everyday lives so\nthat more people can care about sustainability.\nHow are you finding the balance between running\nSustainaPod and studying Civil Engineering?\nCivil Engineering has been a very stressful course, and\nI\u2019m only in Year 1. I care about this project, but there\u2019s\ngot to be balance. You might say I\u2019ve sacrificed my free\ntime, and I\u2019m not going out as much as other first-years, but I would not use the word \u2018sacrifice\u2019. If you\nlike what you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not called sacrifice \u2013 and\nI like what I\u2019m doing. Most of our members are aged\n14 to 17. I\u2019m paving a road for those members and even\nwatching them grow up.\nI want to shout out Chinny Kwok, an integral part\nof our team. When she first joined us, she didn\u2019t know\nmuch about sustainability. In Year 11, she had her own\nmini-series \u2013 this wasn\u2019t even for her CV. Then she\nstarted to work more with us, build up a leadership\nrole, and now she\u2019s promoting SustainaPod at webinars\nwith other organisations. She\u2019s leading our Hong Kong\nbranch and doing such a great job. That\u2019s the opportunity that we want to bring for everyone. We will help you\nas much as you want to help yourself \u2013 whatever you put\nin, you get out.\nSpeaking of opportunity, do you know what you\nwant to do after you graduate?\nAbsolutely not. I\u2019ve had so many ideas for what I could\ndo in the future, and I\u2019ve been to the Careers Service. Because this is an NGO, it\u2019s not going to make me a living\n\u2013 but could it break even? Belinda and I have put quite\na lot of our own money into the podcast, but we see it\nas an investment in helping young kids grow. My dream\nwould be to work and live off this podcast, but we\u2019ll have\nto see.\nHow can Imperial students get involved?\nWe\u2019re always looking for interested students to support\nand lead podcast production. Tell us what topics you\u2019re\ninterested in, and we can connect you to someone in\nour network to have a conversation. You will learn how\nto plan a script, have a dynamic conversation, and tell\na story through editing. We will guide you through the\nprocess and publish your work. The long-term goal is\nto build a community of like-minded students that are\nopen to exploring the world of sustainability and amplifying this through storytelling.\nFor the Pre-Accelerator, we\u2019re trying to build a website that will be an all-in-one interactive educational\nresource for students to access resources and stories related to sustainability topics and careers. We\u2019re aiming\nto have users go through a three-stage learning journey\n\u2013 learn, engage, and act \u2013 that positions them in the best\nway to enter an impact-focused and/or sustainability-fo-cused career after graduation. Our website will spotlight\nthe stories, insights, and experiences from those already\nin green careers. If anyone has any ideas for\nwhat features we can\nput on the website, contact us. Be it activities,\nquizzes, or potential\ninterviewees, send your\nideas our way and we\u2019ll\nread them all.To share\nsuggestions for the\nwebsite, scan the QR\ncode.\nIf you are interested in joining, collaborating with, or sponsoring SustainaPod, they can be contacted on Instagram\n(@sustainapod_gih, @sustainapod_imperial) or LinkedIn.\nnaPod\nSustainaPod co-founders Belinda Ng and Paco Wu.

Having co-founded a sustainaibility podcast\ncalled SustainaPod at school, Paco hopes\nto expand SustainaPod to a multi-media\neducational platform at Imperial. This is\nwhat he had to say.\nWhat is SustainaPod?\nSustainaPod is a youth-led podcast delving into sustainability stories across sec-tors. Students host episodes exploring\nthe world of sustainability with leading\npractitioners and changemakers around\nthe world. By fostering intergenerational\ndialogue, SustainaPod is an accessible resource empowering the next generation\nof sustainability practitioners to navigate\ntheir careers.\nThere has never been a more important time to get engaged in creating a\nsustainable future. The science tells us\nthat it\u2019s not going well \u2013 and SustainaPod\nwill cover that science \u2013 but the more important thing is how you can help. This\nis an industry you might be interested in,\nand this is how to get into that industry.\nWe\u2019re enabling students to learn more\nabout not only jobs in sustainability, but\nalso how sustainability will affect industries \u2013 which it will!\nThe podcast is uploaded to Spotify\n(scan the QR code on the next page) and\nYouTube (https://www.youtube.com/@\nsustainapod).\nHow was SustainaPod founded?\nWe were podcasting as part of another\norganisation, but activity there slowed\ndown so seven of us decided to start\nour own podcast. My co-founder, Belinda Ng, initiated the idea for the podcast\nas a fresh graduate passionate about\nsustainability but not sure how this\ncould translate to a career. She\nfound it empowering and inspiring to speak with professionals\nworking across industries. Together with myself and a small\nteam of interested individu-als, she created the podcast to\namplify these meaningful and\neducational conversations. Belinda graduated from Imperial\u2019s\nMSc in Environmental Technology in 2022.\nAlthough Belinda and I are\nthe faces of SustainaPod, there\u2019s\na bunch of youth members that\nwork tirelessly with us and we have\nexperienced tremendous growth. In\n2021, we were at about 14 people \u2013 but\nwhen I moved to Concord College in\nShropshire, I recruited another 12 peo-ple. Concord now has its own SustainaPod branch working alongside the Hong\nKong team. Since moving from Concord\nto Imperial, I have set up another branch\nhere. Across the three branches we\u2019re at\nover 30 members.\nSustainaPod Imperial consists of four\nfirst-year students including myself. I\nmet Rukaiya Khondaker on a Horizons\ncourse. She was interested\nin learning more\nabout sus-t a i n a -bility,\nso I recruited her and\nshe\u2019s been an integral\npart of SustainaPod Imperial.\nSelina Yeung is from Hong Kong and\nwent to the same school as Belinda.

Sporting over 160\nlegs and spanning 70 mm in length,\nit has been reported to consume plant\nmatter every now and then, a rare\ntrait among centipedes.\nThe white-striped centipede (Henia\nvesuviana) is another large species,\nwith a greyish body that distinctly\nwidens midway. It is a rarity elsewhere in the country but frequent\nunder logs and stones in London and\nin coastal areas.\nThis species is known to secrete a\nsticky glue from its underside when\nconfronted by predators, enough to\nsew a predatory beetle\u2019s mouthparts\nshut for several hours.\nI once found one at Prince\u2019s Gate\nGardens as it was in the process of\nburrowing into a millipede lunch.\n(This was well before I began macro\nphotography, but I\u2019ve included the\nterrible photo anyway \u2014 not for the\nfaint of heart.)\nThe impressive Geophilus flavus is\ninstantly recognisable by its long antennae and blood-red head, in stark\ncontrast to its pale yellow body.\nOther species like Schendyla nemo-rensis and Geophilus truncorum can be\nseen under rotting wood, while the\ngrey and orange Geophilus carpopha-gus lives in small cracks under peeling tree bark and can be seen trundling along trunks and walls at night.\nFor better or for worse, we share\nour world with a plethora of zany\ncharacters, and blind venomous\nworms with legs don\u2019t even scratch\nthe surface (pun intended).
