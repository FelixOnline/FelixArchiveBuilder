Full report\nin Late News.\nThere is a faction among high places in IC Union who, if not\nalready, will probably soon be dubbing Dr. J.R. Butler, warden\nof Keogh Hall, as a second Cameron, big enemy of the Union. He\nwas the driving force behind the Rugby match of 16th February\nagainst Tizard, one of many ideas for fostering some em by ro of Hall\nspirit.\nTizard has hot air, Selkirk a tradition, but the two lower Southside Halls were designed by the architect with little thought for communal life. While it is very convenient to be able to descend the\nstairs leading straight outdoors and upper gallery lifts are handy for\nthird-floor residents, there is little incentive to use the lower gallery\nor browse over the Hall notice boards.\nThe penthouse dwellers are stead apathy reigns, and a hand-keen to build up sporting and ful of diehards save them from\nsocial activities in the Halls of\nResidence. The Union argues\nthat they already provide all the\nnecessary clubs and societies, and\nthat such activities should be run\nentirely by them. Such an argument would be genuine if the\nUnion organisations remained\nactive throughout the year; in-SteelIS PROGRESS i| P5\n\u2014 ~^tJ\nSTEEL gives a man the opportunity to\nrise by ability and achievement,\nirrespective of age. It is an exciting\nindustry now undergoing a revolution\nIn manufacturing methods, In the development of new types of steel, in new\ntechniques of application. Since the\nwar over a million pounds a week have\nbeen spent on development and\nmodernisation. The present rate of\ndevelopment Is at four times this rate.\nSteel is Britain's biggest manufacturing Industry and the basis of our whole\neconomy.

Every student has a lot\nof academic work to do, especially near exams., and officials\nhave hardly the time to continue\nto press others to maintain interest in the clubs.\nHere the wardens have the ad-vantage, for they can maintain\npressure throughout the year.\nDue to smaller numbers, the Hall\ncommunities have a more personal atmosphere and so are\nmore acceptable to shy people.\nIn fact, the Hall can act as a stepping-stone for future top-people in the Union, for here is\nthe ideal position to gain experience in handling others. Loss of\nface is of less import; a high\nproportion of Hall residents are\nyour friends, in the Union you\nhave few.\nThe wardens should be en cou aged to develop Hall spirit. In\nthis way, while having an active\nsocial life in Hall, those who are\nreally interested in the Union\nfacilities will use them. The Halls\nare severely limited in the range\nof interests for which they can\ncater. Minority interests in the\nUnion\u2014and there are many-will not be hurt.

    "content": "FELIX9 JUDOCLUB\nBritish\nChampions\nThe club achieved its biggest\nsuccess of the year when the 1st team won the British Inter-Collegiate Championships, held at\nU.L. U. on February 15th. Three\nteams were entered from the\nClub :\u2014\n1st Team: R. Bedding, K. Dugdale, D. Watson.\n2nd Team : C. Cohn, P. McGlone, P. Hunt.\n3rd Team : P. Drury, D. Payne,\nPrescott.\nThe first team convincingly\nwon their pool and then went on\nto beat Regent Street Poly in the\nsemi-finals and Q.M. C. in the\nfinal. The 2nd and 3rd teams did\nnot meet with the same success\nand although both fought well,\nneither managed to win their respective pools.\nHyde Park Road Relay\nIT'S GEAR\nLiverpool's Year\nOn Saturday, February 22nd, Cilia Black held the No. 1 spot\nin the hit parade, Liverpool F.C. took another step towards the\nleague and cup double and the \" gear \" boys themselves caused chaos\nat London Airport when they arrived back from America. With\nall this going on, few papers indeed found space to record that on\nthe same day Liverpool University walked off with the major college\nroad race of the year, the Imperial College Hyde Park Road Relay.\nPursuit True, this result was not entirely unexpected, since Liverpool\nhad beaten the might of London\nand Oxford at the BUSF crosscountry champs, only a few\nweeks before, but it was in doubt\nright up to the final lap. At the\nlast changeover Liverpool were\nleading with Bristol second and\nLoughborough third.\nJohn Whetton of Loughborough, a near four-minute\nmiler, took off in hot pursuit,\nsoon passed Taunton-Rigby of\nBristol and closed steadily on\nJackson of Liverpool. Jackson\nwas well on his way to the fifth\nfastest individual time of the day,\nhowever, and Whetton, seven\nseconds faster and third fastest of\nthe day, could do no better than\nclose the gap between them to\neleven seconds at the finishing\nline.\nCROSS COUNTRY\nFOUR'S A CROWD\nFixtures tend to get somewhat\nhectic at this time of the season\nand, with four major races in the\nlast week and a half, this year is\nproving no exception.\nOn February 5th there was a strong field down at Petersham\nfor a home match between\nBorough Road, London Hospital,\nGoldsmiths and ourselves. Borough Road, with the first three\nhome and only 19pts., were easy\nwinners; next came I.C. and\nGoldsmiths with 60pts. each\u2014\nI.C. getting the verdict on \" goal\naverage.\"\nRECORD A week later we travelled to\nEpping for the S.W. E.T.C.( spelt\nSouth West Essex Tech.) trophy\nrace where our 1st team was 9th \u2014just behind Goldsmiths this\ntime. In this race Pete Yates\n(U.C. and getting faster all the\ntime) set a new course record of\n21-56s. On the Saturday (15th) we sent\na smallish team to Reading where\nwe convincingly beat their even\nsmaller team of three.\nHowever our lads must have\nrun hard because in the trial held\non the Tuesday, to select our\nteam for the Hyde Park, times\nwere much slower than they\nshould have been \u2014 they improved on the day though.\nRELEGATION\nThe next day brought a league\nI match\u2014.Petersham again: we\nhardly seem to go anywhere else,\nthese days\u2014and, not appearing\nto feel the strain too much, our\n1st team ran well and stayed\nclear of the fight for relegation\n(our 2nd team is already odds-on\nfavourite for that).\nAnd finally to the Hyde Park\nitself\u2014we finished 31st as last\nyear, but turned t ne tables on\nKings who slipped from 30th tc\n32nd. THANKS\nThe organisers would like to\nthank all those members of the\ncollege who helped to make the\nRelay a success ; also Pete Crews\nand I are very grateful to everybody who worked so hard at the\nHop afterwards.\nSPARKES CUP\nThe last three Wednesdays of\nterm are given over to the\nSparkes Cup. As yet no firm\nfavourites have emerged.\nGuilds captained by P. Darkins\nboasts many players with I.C. experience but one wonders if he\ncan build them into a fighting\nunit.\nMines under D. Wakelin are\nthe dark horses and with a back\nrow of Turner, Tax and Coxall\nthey must be a force to be reckoned with.\nR.C.S. under A. Turner have\nvery strong outsides with Choppell and Caudwell on the wings\nbut seem weak at forward. Only\nRavno and Havard have 1st XV experience in the pack.\nWar Cry As the Liverpool team received\nthe Sir Roderick Hill Cup and\ntheir medals from Lady Hill after\nthe race, supporters chanted the\nMerseyside war-cry \" Liverpool,\" of Anfield fame and followed this up with a few im-prom tu\" Yeah, Yeah, Yeah's.\" Queen's College, Cambridge,\nfor whom D.M. Turner ran a record fastest lap, once again\nwon the Imperial College Union\nCup for colleges with less than\n500 male students. This they received for the fourth successive\nyear, after the now nationally\nfamous eleventh hour confession\nof \"double running\" by a theological member of the Christchurch College, Oxford team.\nSOCCER\nCup Spotlight\nColin\nCa&e more His foo ball honours\nare many\u2014Captain of the University, Bristol University caps;\nSussex County, A.

    "content": "FELIX dear sir sex\nexplanation\nThe Editor, Felix,\nDear Sir,\nAs (the author of the recent\narticle in Felix entitled\" Undersexed,\" I should like to reply to\nmy critics. Reactions have ranged\nfrom\"\" How can you equate interest in sex with sexual inter-course?\" to simply \" It should not\nhave been published,\" and a few\npeople took the opportunity to\npoint out that intercourse outside\nmarriage is wrong. The whole\npoint of the article was that if\none takes into consideration the\nSocial, moral, religious, and environmental aspects of the pro b lem, they still cannot explain the\ndifference in figures between Oxford and l.C. Surely it must be\nobvious that even at Oxford there\nare students who think that intercourse outside marriage is'wrong,\nand that one cannot equate interest in sex with sexual inter-course. When comparing the\nfigures I was not debating these\nfacts, but saying that in spite of\nall the above considerations there\nstill seemed to be an unexplained\nfactor based most probably on the\nbackground history of the average\nl.C. student. This factor seems\nto me to be most definitely an\n\"absence of feeling\" (definition\nof apathy) towards sex, I did not\npass judgement in the article as\nto whether this is a good or-,a bad\nthing. Some students seem to be\nso brainwashed that when one\nmentions sex they react disapprovingly, without even trying to\nsee what the discussion is all\nabout. Mine was a sociological\nand not a moral conclusion. As\nto the criticisms that such articles\non sex should not be published, I can only say that if sex cannot be\ndiscussed at University, then\nwhere can it ? Readers are referred to an article in Punch\n(Feb. 5th) on sex at Oxford.\nFinally I would like to add that I have revised my figures. Those\nfor men and women at I.C. should be five per cent, higher\nthan quoted previously, and those\nfor Oxford should both be at\nleast ten per cent, higher. The\nunexplained factor looms larger\nthan ever now.\nYours respectfully,\nPETER A. RIDING.\ngo ahead\nDear Sir,\nWe do not believe in an apos-tel ic succession extending to Mr.\nSheridan\u2014\"fornication is wrong\"\n\u2014nor do we accept God, Christ\nor their teachings. Consequently\nwe were amused by the recent\nmild ob sen it y in Felix (we are not\nimmune to dirty jokes) and concurred with many of the ideas of\nUNDERSEXED.\nThe few Christian dogmatists\n(Phillips, Sheridan, Ellis et cd) become offensive when their censorious attitudes extend beyond\nthe limits of their personal relationship. We enjoy fornication\n(it would be surprising if we\ndidn't.) \u2014and accept this as suf fi find the time or inclination io conjure up such useless accusations\nfrom trivial and harmless ma-teri al. Yours,\nDAVE HUNT\nprattling s Dear Sir,\n1 was greatly amused, in your\nlast edition, by the prattling s of\nour angry virgins. I trust that they\nwill follow the advice of their\ngood book and keep their lamps\nwell filled and neatly trimmed,\njust in case . ..\nTo become more serious, how-ever, 1 would like to point out\nthat there are a large number of\npeople in this college who, like\nmyself, believe in moral concepts\ndifferent from the Christian ones\nand who probably believe in them\njust as strongly and adhere to\nthem just as strictly as any Christian does to his.\nIf the Christians in this college\ndesire to retain the respect of the\nrest of the college I would suggest\nthat they express their fiery evangelism in a form more acceptable\nto intelligent audience.\nYours sincerely,\nHUGH FRAZER.\nanti sex? girl punched\nDear Sir,\nI would like to lodge a violent objection to the behaviour of\ncertain members of I.C. arising from an incident in the Union bar\non the evening of Feb. 25th. A group of Bedford girls entered the bar with the express intention\nof collecting for the U.L. U. Carnival (which, after all was initiated\nfor the same purpose as the I.C. Carnival). After a short, sharp\nscuffle they were forcibly ejected\u2014fair enough you may say l However, the manner of their removal was far from that expected\nfrom any member of the superior sex when dealing with females. The\nuse of fists should be restricted to the gymnasium; perhaps the part icU pants were overcome by the proximity of the Liston-Clay meeting\nIt is notable that mv as ions by other male colleges are seldom\nrepelled effectively; the use of such rough-house tactics should be reserved for such occasions.\nTo emphasise the harshness of the methods used and if possible\nto promote some sense of guilt in the mala diu s ted persons responsible\nmay I finally quote the example of one girl who was punched in the\nface, thrown to the ground and kicked as she lay there.\nI.C. is noted for its isolationist policy\u2014surely even that cannot\nexcuse such extremist behaviour. m.V. WHITEHEAD\nDear Sir,\nI was sorry to learn from the\nlast issue of \" Felix\" that even\nI.C. harbours its quota (relatively\ninsignificant, I trust) of the anti-sex school, i.e. those who regard\nanything connected with sex as intrinsically dirty, obscene and im-proper. Even sex within marriage\none suspects, is to be viewed as a necessary evil. In the words of\none of your correspondents \"sex-u al intercourse outside marriage\nis wrong (my emphasis) and many\nreligions and societies forbid it.\"\nI wonder whether your correspondent realises that the reason\nfor such religious sanction of premarital chastity arises simply from\nthe fact up till the present century\nno other really acceptable alternative form of birth control has\nexisted?

    "content": "4 FELIX EDITORIAL\nA KILDARE FOR IMPERIAL\nEarlier this term Felix published an article on the status of the\nEngineer, which showed that so far Guildsmeu are not as such socially\nacceptable. Many will agree that the appeal of engineering is not\nall that it might be and one often hears a student at a party explaining that he is an engineer and then a polo gi sing \u2014\" It helps to pass\nthe time\" or \" a means to an end.\"\nThe article suggested that something could be done to accelerate\nthe process of educating the public concerning the real significance\nof the Engineer. Mr. Jones offered, quite seriously, the suggestion\nthat a technological hero be created on the lines of Kildare or Barlow\nin Z cars. He has further written to ask if we at Imperial College\nwould be interested in doing anything about it. A production with\nan Engineer in the lead and his work as a background to dramatic\nsituations sounds more than plausible.\nA30 minutes film along these lines would be a tremendous challenge to the dramatic society, film society, and photographic society\nand give them an opportunity of creating something lasting. Were\nthe film of reasonable quality then either B.B.C. or I.T.V. could\nwell be most interested and might even offer financial support. Here\nis an idea which apart from providing a tremendous challenge, will\ncontribute enormously to future generations at Imperial. If anyone\nis interested in such a project then please see me, Room 73, Beit\nHall.\nA previous idea for a film of I.C. was scrapped for lack of financial support. Any film goer will know that there are hundreds of\namateur groups throughout the country making films (some of them\nvery good) on a shoestring. With an aim as definite as this one\nfinancial backing should not be difficult to obtain.\nGROTTY\nWith the arrival of the word \" gro tty\" and its widespread use,\nhas come a totally unconnected, but most appropriate phenomenon.\nGrotty Advertising. Although the standard of advertising around\nCollege is inherently high, its positioning can only be described as\ngro tty. Boards are provided, but now posters are stuck to walls,\ndoors, and windows. This habit of putting your notices anywhere\nwas probably started by the executive when public ising Union meet-in gs.; \u2022; Now it is everywhere, in the Union, in the Halls, and in the\nrefectories\u2014even party organisers find it necessary to plaster unsightly bits of paper anywhere but on the noticeboards. The Southside stomp organisers have gone one better by issuing stickers which\nappear on walls, cars, woodwork and the tubes. These are very\ndifficult to wash off and have considerable nuisance value\u2014very little\nelse.\nSomething should be done about this, and Wardens, Union\nofficers, and Society promoters should unite to stamp it out before\nour buildings became gro t tier and more unsightly than they already\nare.\nRIGHT SECOND TIME\nCongratulations to Mr. Watson who after a nightmare first\nUnion meeting showed us how in a brilliant second. A well-known\nAmerican President once demonstrated his formula for success with\na piece of string on a table\u2014\" If I push it, it folds up, but if I pull\nit I can lead it where I please.\" Last ThursdayYUnion Meeting\nwas a case in point. Working behind the scenes is all very well, but\nwhat this place needs is a bit of real leadership ; let us not have a repeat of that sham boli c Tuesday. One interesting point however,\nis that it is unconstitutional to propose a motion from the Chair and\nso in fact our widely heralded changes may not strictly be law; Mr.\nWatson did not mention the actual precedents he claimed ! Perhaps\nhe meant Mr. Chandmal's example in the N.U.S. debate last year.\n\\OPERA\nThe College is very fortunate\nin being able to draw musical\ntalent from the dark cellars of\nR.C.M., and mixing this with our\nown, produced a lively and well-sung performance of the Gondoliers last Thursday week.\nThe opera's satire, however,\nwas never intended to extend as\nfar as the orchestra pit\u2014on this\noccasion it did. The wind sec-tion's intonation and tone quality\nwas often sadly lacking, and the\nhorn player, despite his best in-tent ions, rarely confined himself\nto the narrow limits set by the\nComposer. One can sym pathis e with the orchestra having to play\nfor someone else's opera, but it\nis unfortunate that they had not\nspent more time in useful rehearsal\nBROWN B AGGER BROUGH ADVERTISEMENT\nROULETTE Wheel, Cloth and\nChips for hire. 10/- per function.\nAppl Vice-Pres.

Watson must have realised this, for he watered down the\noriginal motion considerably, and simply proposed the establishment\nof an independent arbitrator over the editor. The sole purpose of\nthis I.C.\" Ombudsman\" would have been to order the editor to\ninclude in his newspaper material that he, the a rbi traor, would have\njudged to be of general interest to Union members. This, of course,\nsounded reasonable enough, until Watson himself pointed out the\nvagueness of the proposals and Mike Combes stressed the absolute necessity of not tampering with the editor's freedom. He added\nthat not only would any editor worth his job feel unable to run a newspaper under such a restriction, but as the editor was appointed\nby the felix board in the first place he should presumably have\ntheir fullest confidence.\nFortunately the highly personal\nnature of this motion was not exploited to any great extent. It\nwas regretted, however, that\nGopal Srinivassen tried to bring\nthis up. Credit must be given to\nWatson for proposing such a hopeless motion so elo qu end y, and for steering well clear of\npersonalities.\nDEPTHS OF DULLNESS\nTuesday's debate on the constitutional changes has been\nmuch criticised for its appalling\nhandling, its timing and for the\napparent attempt to bull dose the changes through. The depths\nof dullness were probed by the\nproposer s, and it was not difficult\nto side with the more emotional\nspeeches from the floor. Havard\nand Airey, with their highly contrasting motives and methods,\nwere particularly, effective in\nstressing, firstly, that \"Inner\nCircles\" were not too happy\nabout the whole business, and\nsecondly the \" anomalies \" in the\nmethods of elections.\nTACTLESS REMARKS\nDave Loftus, in a well-timed\nspeech, probably did more than\nanybody else to defeat the\nmotion ; not forgetting Gravette's unfortunate and tactless remarks.\nEven Watson was surprisingly ineffective\u2014'his characteristic clear\nthinking was marred by an obvious air of desperation.\nOn the Thursday, the motion\nwas debated in parts after it had\nbeen rejected on the Tuesday by\na paper vote. Watson gave himself the privilege of speaking\nmost of the time, and was extremely effective. All the motions were carried and, in direct\ncontrast to the previous fiasco,\nthe various objections that arose\nwere easily passed over. As\neverybody had expected all along,\nthe changes were accepted.\nTOKYO?\nJohn Boulter (Bristol), British\nOlympic hope for the 800 m., running in the Hyde Park last\nweek.\n\n"

While\nhoping that this appeal has all\nthe success that it deserves one\nrealises that the majority of us\nwill not be able to respond to it\nor at least not for another one or\ntwo years. There must, however,\nbe many who would like to engage in some such service in this\ncountry.\nRACIAL HARMONY The Commonwealth Service\nGroup was set up specifically to\ntap this enthusiasm. It is a group\nof young people in the 17-25 age\nrange who offer their services to\npromote racial harmony in this\ncountry. This work takes place\nof necessity mainly among im mi grants. The Group tries to\nachieve its ends by three main\nmethods: (1) Learning more\nabout Commonwealth countries\nfrom lectures and films at\nmonthly meetings, (2) Working\nfor immigrants, (3) Attracting\nCommonwealth young people into the Group and so working\nwith, as well as for, overseas\nmembers of the Commonwealth.\n(This last method has been singularly unsuccessful in that the vast\nmajority of members are natives\nof this country.) Currently the\nmain work undertaken by the\nGroup is the coaching of semi-literate and numerate immigrants\nin English and Maths, although\nwe also decorate homes occasion-ally, and at the moment are trying to organise a discussion club\nin a South London College.\nMembership of the Group is\nopen to any member of the\nCommonwealth.

    "content": "8 FELIX dear sir... don't think I have ever seen such\na clear case of bumbling bureaucracy as that shown in the speech\nmade by Mr. Watson. It seems\nthat the panacea to all the ills of\nImperial College Union should be\nsolved by adding one or more\nmembers to the committees,\nboards and councils. Oh when,\noh when, will people realise that\none should not increase the numbers making up these bodies.\nGranted there may be cases wher,\nchanges in the composition o) of such committees as the Union\nCouncil may be necessary, but\nwhy not do away with those positions which have become obsolete\nfirst ?\nWith these thoughts in mind,\nsurely the most potent argument\nagainst Mr. Watson's suggestions\nfor the Felix board, which includes a fair proportion of Union\n(Jouncil, was that far from further\nsaddling this active, healthy and\npopular part of the college life\nwith a\" super editor \" we should\nask for the removal of all those\nmembers of the board who do not\ntake active part in the preparation\nand compilation of the. paper.\nMake the board smaller and more\nmanageable and we wi Ft have an\neven better paper.\nAs regards to the safeguards of\nsuch a system, surely they are already in force. The editor of\nFelix can be called before a Union\nmeeting and censored. In fact,\nsome six years ago an editor was\nquite rightly removed from his\nposition for producing a heavily\npolitically biased paper.\nIn conclusion, let us try and keep\nImperial College out of the\nclutches of involved constitutions\nand keep the number of committee members down to a minimum.\nYours sincerely,\nD.L.

    "content": "FELIX7 dear sir... the outmoded view that fornication is wrong per se, now that\nmore sophisticated methods of\nbirth control are at hand, is simply\nto invite ridicule.\nHowever, I will admit that before premarital or extramarital intercourse can be defens i bly indulged in two essential conditions\nshould be fulfilled, viz. (i) that\nsome form of permanent or semi-permanent relationship exist between the two parties concerned\nand (ii) that intercourse be freely\ndesired by both parties. Only\nwhen these two conditions are\nfulfilled, I believe, can it be morally justifiable to indulge either in\nfornication or adultery.\nTo reject all forms of sexual\nexperience outside of marriage\nunequivocally is to totally disregard one of the potentially greatest\nand beautiful things that the-human race can aspire to and is\nmorally quite indefensible. And\nlet it never be forgotten that chastity outside of marriage must\ninevitably go hand in hand with\nthe evil of prostitution. Until men\nrealise that a responsible attitude\nto sexual behaviour does not condemn out of hand those unable to\nlive in a state of self-imposed\nasceticism and learn to see their\nsexual indulgences as a necessary\nand vital factor in our human con-d it ion, then inevitably much suffering must continue to result\nfrom our own pitiable lack of\nunderstanding of our fellow men.\nYours sincerely,\nDENNIS H. ROUVRAY\nI.C. Huxley Society\nDear Sir,\nSince I have started reading\nFelix (1957) there have been several ups and downs in the standard\nof the articles and even more frequent changes of editors and\npolicy. Though I do not agree\nwith all that has been written this\nyear I have no hesitation in saying\nthat at long last, though perhaps\nsometimes too controversial for\nsome people, Felix is an interesting and well written paper.\nThe mam reason for writing\nthis letter is two-fold and concerns\ntwo items that appeared in recent\neditions and the storm of protest\nthey have caused by the so called\nrighteous and virtuous. Needless\nto say I am referring to ' Undersexed' and the photograph on the\nback of the 100th Edition.\nOne could say that the photograph was perhaps a little daring\nand that some of the conclusions\nimplied in that article rather odd,\nbut to suggest that they do not\nexpect such obscenity to emanate\nfrom the minds of morally responsible beings who should be stopped from prop o gating this sort of\nmoral depravity, etc. is rather pa-the tic. All that I can say is that it must\ntake a very warped mind indeed\nto conjure up a view of such depravity and obscenity. From the\ncries of horror of some of the\nletters one gets the impression that\njust by reading the articles masses\nof students are going to carry out\nthe most vile deeds and start leading an immoral life. Most people\nhave their own moral standards\nand I feel sure that no person with\nany self respect will change his or\nher behaviour so radical fy just\nA new career prospect\nfor teachers\nMale graduates and qualified teachers\nare needed to teach as officers in the Royal Army Educational Corps.\nService in the R.A.E. C. offers:\u2014\n* A salary of up to \u00a31,500 by age 27 as a married captain, and, if on a regular or limited service engagement, a salary of \u00a32,000 by age 34 as a major.\n* Full seniority on the Burnham scale, enabling officers to return to civilian\nteaching, should they decide to leave the service or on retirement.\n* A varied life with the chance to serve in Hong Kong, Cyprus, Malta,\nGibraltar and many other stations.\n* Teaching at all levels, from remedial to degree standard, and to all age\ngroups: children; adolescents; and adults.\nTypes of commission available:\u2014\nRegular. Open to graduates under 25. This offers career prospects to the age of 55, with a pension of \u00a31,000\u2014\u00a31,600.\nLimited Service. Open to graduates and qualified teachers under\n39. This offers i pension and tax-free gratuity of \u00a3585 and \u00a31,755\nrespectively after only 16 years service.\nShort Service. Open to graduates and qualified teachers under\n43. This is granted for an initial period of 3 years, which may\nbe extended to 12, and earns a tax-free gratuity of \u00a3180 for each\nyear served.\nGraduates serving on Limited or1' Short Service Commissions\nhave the opportunity of transferring to regular commissions.\nIf you are a graduate, a qualified teacher,-or hold equivalent technical\nqualifications, write for full details to:\u2014\nThe Director of Army Education, (TL/69/A), War Office, (AE1), Stanmore, Middz.\nWomen with suitable qualifications are required in the WRAC for duty\nwith R.A.E. C. because they have read one short\narticle or looked at a photograph.\nSurely the whole point of coming to University is not just to\nlearn a few formulae but to learn\nhow to think and be prepared to\nface life in the wide world. If\nstudents' actions and morals are\nto be dramatically influenced by\nthat article or the photograph I just hate to think what they will\nbecome in a few years when they\nhave to work in industry.\nSir, may I conclude by saying\nthat though I have not always\napproved oj the view expressed\nin Felix I congratulate you on a very fine effort indeed and if as\none can gather \"a head must roll\"\nover editorial policy, I for one\nhope that it will not be Felix's.I suggest that in Felix's next\nawards list you include the \"Honi\nsoit qui mal y pens e\" to certain\nimaginative individuals.\nYours faithfully,\nS.R. KLAT, P.G. Mech.Eng.\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to last issue's envious\nphysicist, we, as frustrated PGs,\nwould like to point out that.it is\ncash that most people look for\nin preference to any number of\ndiffraction gratings, whose value\nin- pawn-shops is very little.\nYours sincerely,\nM LEE\nM. NEVILLE-POLLEY\nmothers union\nDear Sir,\nI have just attended the Union\nmeeting held on Thursday, 20th February, and I feel impelled to\nmake a few comments concerning\nthe way in which the meeting was\nrun in general and also about the\nlast motion \u2014 that concerning\nFelix.\nRarely can a Union meeting\nhave been so badly handled.\nAmendments, which were not\namendments, but purely an excuse for the proposer to add more\n\" humbug \" and \" jumble \" to the\nalready chaotic proceedings. I am sure that it is a good thing to\nhave an active Union with varied\npoints of view, but let us try and\nkeep speeches to the point of the\nmotion\u2014this is the duty of the\nchairman and should be strictly\nenforced\u2014and let us try and have\nUnion meetings which resemble a reasonably dignified debating\nchamber and not a disorganised\nMothers Union meeting. On one\noccasion a member of the Union\ndid not have the courtesy to stand\nup and address the meeting, but\ncontinued to have private discussion with Mr. Watson. When, as\na result of calls from the floor, he\nwas asked to stand, he failed to\napologise and also failed to turn\nround so that he could be heard\nby the rest of the meeting. I would like to point out that I am\nnot blaming the individual, but\nrather those whose job it is to see\nthat meetings are held in an intelligent fashion.\nAs regards the Felix debate, I Contion p.$ "
