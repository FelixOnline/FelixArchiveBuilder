    "content": "SPORT FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1 9 9 5 . TWENTY-THREE\nAnchored in Whitstable\nYachting\nAfter months of gruelling\nphysical training, hours of tortuous tactical debate and more\nthan a years worth of logistical\nplanning two of the most honed\nsailing teams, nay - machines,\nthat mere mortals have ever laid\neyes upon departed for the first\nsailing event of the year.\nHowever no one could have foreseen the cunning underhand tactics that the pitiful opposition\nwere prepared to employ. Little\ndid our two valiant teams know\nthat the high energy isotonic\ndrinks that they thought they\nwere consuming whilst travelling\nwind picked up and racing began.\nBoth teams put up respectable\nearly season performances, but\nthe poor conditions meant that\nthere was a lot of racing left to be\ndone on Sunday. Whitstable\nyacht club provided an excellent\nevening's entertainment on\nSaturday, ably assisted by the\nevent's sponsors:- Shepherd's Neame Brewery. A number of\nteam members, determined to\nmake up for poor performances\non the water, decided to give\ntheir all in the bar. The second\nteam captain, Paul 'Tarzan'\nRoche went beyond the call of\non Friday evening had in fact\nbeen switched for beverages with\nan alcoholic content.\nDespite the aforementioned\ndespicable rouse your kindhearted heroes still managed to find\ntime in their packed itinerary to\nassist the University of Kent at\nCanterbury with their parking\narrangements, before retiring to\nthe luxury Hotel laid on by the\nhost University. Saturday began\nhazy and slightly late, with members of both teams cursing themselves for falling victim to the\nopposition's dirty tactics.\nAfter some deliberation the\nhost club decided to suspend the\ncommencement of racing due to\nthe passing hurricane - rumours\nthat the wind was gusting up to\nhalf a mile an hour were rife.\nTension within the already highly strung teams began to rise.\nFinally in the early afternoon the\nduty to cement relationships\nbetween IC and the host club.\nPaul 'Chunder Blunder' Linford\ndid likewise.\nThe races came thick and\nfast as the pressure was on to finish the 50 or so remaining match-es. Competition was fierce as a number of races went right to\nthe line. The first team showed\ngreat boat speed on a number of\noccasions, but as the majority of\nthem were new to team racing\nthey lost out tactically to more\nexperienced teams. Protests flew\nas the interpretation of the sailing rules became more and more\nconvoluted, a sure sign that\neveryone was trying hard enough!\nOnce the spray had settled, both\nteams had respectable placings.\nThe first team won 7 races and\nlost 4 - placing them 5th overall,\nwhilst the seconds won 4 and lost\n7 - placing them 9th overall.\nSquash 4th s A challenging season lies\nahead for the Imperial College\nfourth team following their well\ndeserved promotion this year\ninto London Division 2. The\nteam this season is comprised of\nNick Alsop (captain), Markkv\nVentiainen, Liam Hudson and\nAdam Ritz.\nThe season started poorly as\nIC4s were unable in the first\ntwo weeks to field a full strength\nteam. Last week a full strength\nIC4 struggled in their first away\nfixture against the disciplined\nfirst team from the medics at\nRoyal Free Hospital.\nThe only game achieved was\nby Mark at player 2, in a match\ncharacterised by long rallies and\nwinning boasts. A resounding\nreturn to form is expected this\nweek in a home match against\nthe first team from the students\nat United Medical and Dental\nSchools .\nSquash 5th s The season failed to get off\nto a flying start for us as we were\nbeaten (thrashed?) by the college of law who are obviously in\nthe wrong league.\nAn under strength side travelled to Queen Mary and\nWestfield the following week to\npick up a few points, winning\none match out of four. However,\nlast week Alec, Sarfraz and Ian\nthe triumphant s gave University\nCollege London a mauling with\nonly Rob the not so triumphant\nlosing and he was extremely\nunlucky and was by far the better player.\nOn Monday we travelled to\nSt Georges with mixed fortunes.\nIan was the only triumphant\nwith Sarfraz making a strong\ncomeback to just lose. Ian and\nRob were sent packing but it\ncould have been much different\nhad we been better players. Last\nyear's promotion has put us up\nagainst tough opposition but we\nwill soon be back to consist ant winning ways.\nThis weeks result: St\nGeorges Medical School\n(StGMS) 3, IC 1.\nCross country\nThis Wednesday the IC XC team took part in the 6th Annual Metropolis sub tera ne an railway meeting, more commonly known as the sewer rats race.\nThis unique event was first held\nthrough the present day\nNorthern Line, which was\nclosed especially for the race.\nRunners converged from all over\nBriatin for this prestigious event\nwhich was considered second\nonly to the London\nBirmingham 'Rocket Race'. It is\nwidely re cog in is ed that Roger\nBannister used this rce as a warm up to his world record\nfour-minute mile. Previous winners include Sebastian Coe, Said\nAouita and Jennie Rogers.\nThe increase in commuters\nmeant that in 1953, closure of\nthe Northern Line was deemed\ntoo cost in-effective, and since\nthen, the race has been held\nabove ground. During this time,\nthe most famous winners have\nbeen Eric Liddel, Andy Overend\nand Cedd Burge. In these\nenlightened times, the race has\nto be held away from centres of\nhigh traffic concentration, this\nyear's organisers choosing\nCamden Park Road to Seven\nSisters Road. The course is still,\nhowever, reasonably hazardous,\nrunners having to contend with\nirate taxi drivers, irate bus drivers and perhaps worst of all,\nhoards of Japanese tourists.\nHowever, we felt safe in the\nknowledge that St. Johns\nAmbulance Brigade were on\nhand. This year's winner, Tom\nSpicer, is widely believed to\nhave been aided by two No. 14\nbuses, a taxi and extensive\nknowledge of the local area. The\nunofficial winners were named\nas James Tindal Robertson, and\nEmily Collins. The joint organ is ers, Gary Hoare, Gerald JonJohnson and Stephanie Rooke\nsaid that this year's event ran\nrelatively smoothly, compared\nto 1923, when 34 runners were\ntragically killed by an errant\nTube train. Reports at the time\nof a fanatical anti-fitness cult\nwere vehemently denied by a Mr. V. Blobby.\n\n"

UL U President,\nLabour Councillor, available for\nweddings and bar mi tv a hs.I don't know what it is, but I have my\ndoubts about him. The fact that\nhe was elected unopposed struck\nme as unfortunate, although, of\ncourse, not his fault. His alleged\nrole in the Union Bar raid last year | H| still has not been cleared up to the | H9b satisfaction of most people. Until\nrec end y,I thought I might be\nbeing a touch paranoid, but after reading\nNooman Haque's excellent article, it's nice to\nknow I am not alone [Mind you, Nooman, I wouldn't pin your hopes on a Christmas card\nfrom our own Pres). We, like the Kings students\nbefore us, seem to be mere pawns in the Karrian\ngame plan designed to propel him into\nWestminster. It has been shown beyond doubt\nby the NUS that overtly political student representation is a dangerous and counter-productive\nthing, which ends up satisfying the leadership's desires and aspirations at the expense of the rank\nand file membership. As Nooman points out, it\nis a fair question to ask whether Mr Karrian is\nusing the University of London students as a test\nbed for Labour policy on higher education. If this\nis so, it is scandalous and pressure should be\nbrought to bear on him by the other members of\nthe UL U Council. As for the duplicity of our\nown President, I wouldn't like to say. I haven't met Sarah and have heard very little about her\nactions as president (no bad thing, some would\nsay). It does seem however, that she is a little too\neager to jump into the ideological sack with\nGhassan. I like to use the 'Used Car Test' i.e. would you buy I'm afraid that, for my money,\nI 'll not change my motor.\nSpeaking of politics, I am writing this week's column after spending a couple of hours locking\nhorns with one of Paddy\nAshdown's political researchers\nand prospective LibDem parliamentary candidate at the next\nI election. Now, dear reader, you will\nprobably have guessed by now that\nI am not of this political persuasion.\nThat said, I do have considerable\nrespect for the Liberal Democrats.\nOK, they've got more than their\nfair share of daft policies, but at\nleast they are straight down the line\nabout them, which is more than\ncan be said for Tony Blair's mob.\nTheir obsession with constitutional reform as the\ncornerstone of any future Liberal government or\ndeal in a coalition and their insistence that simply\nadding a penny to income tax will solve all the ills\nin the education system do not bear inspection,\nbut they are clear manifesto pledges on which\nthey may be judged. Discussing politics with\nsomeone who makes it her business to know\neverything about everything topical is no picnic.\nI survived, but not without the odd scar or two.\nI heard on the news that the Merseyside\nFire Brigade were striking on November 5th. This latest move in a long series of industrial\naction proves that there are no depths to which\nthe trade unions will not sink. Supposed professionals with a vocation to serve the public who\ntry and hold the authorities to ransom are not fit\nto be employed in the emergency services. It is\nabout time that no-strike agreements were\nestablished in this field, as practised by the\npolice.\nIt has been suggested by some people that\nmy repeated, glowing tributes to Southside Bar\nare a vain attempt to gain free beer. This is\nabsolutely untrue for one very good reason. It\nnever occurred to me, but thanks for the tip!\nFinally, I know I'm not employed for my musical tastes, but go and buy the new Pulp album.\nIt's brilliant. Not 'arf.\nbook: terry p ratchet interesting times,\nand les This book is a good indication of why Terry\nPratchett is so popular. Although Interesting\nTimes, his 16th Discworld novel, is far from his\nbest, it is still an amusing, and hence worthwhile,\nread.\nMaybe Terry is trying to be politic in giving\nall of his favourite characters a turn, because this\ntime the main lead returns to the hero of the first\ntwo novels - the w izzard Rincewind. Catapulted\nby the machinations of the inhabitants of the\nUnseen University into the Agatean Empire - the\nDiscworld equivalent of China - Rincewind\nlearns only too well why the saying 'May You\nLive In Interesting Times' is a curse. The time in\nquestion is that of a revolution by overly respectful peasants, an attempted sacking by a group of\nnonagenarian barbarians, and wood (or to be\nmore specific trunks) showing that it does not\nnecessarily go in for asexual reproduction a la The\nSorcerers Apprentice. It is a pity, however, that\nRincewind's well honed strategy of dealing with\npretty much everything, the method called running away from and letting the to work itself out,\nis indeed Rincewind's strategy for dealing with\npretty much everything.\nAs well as the gags, there is increasingly\nwithin Terry's works a more concrete story.\nAlthough this makes for a more coherent read, I felt that this book, at over 300 pages paperback,\nwas a little too drawn out, and unlike earlier\nbooks was not a one sitting read. Also, chapters\nwould be nice.\nIf you are a dedicated Pratchett fan, you are\ngoing to read this (whatever I say), and probably\nenjoy it. If you are not, start with Guards!\nGuards! instead.\n[Pratchett will be at Forbidden Planet three\nweeks to mmo row.] "

Local residents will be consulted on the new scheme and\ntheir opposition to the development would be highly un de sir able.\nEarl Lancaster was pleased\nwith the meeting, saying 'the\nPro-Rector's presence at the\nmeeting was a positive move.' A Hall Rep present at the meeting\nfelt Linstead had done well, and\nsaid that the Pro-Rector would\nrecommend that the bar is\nreopened. Another point raised\nat the meeting was over the new\nfire alarm system which has yet\nagain came in for criticism as it\nhas proved to be far too sensitive\nand generally unworkable.\nThe Pro-Rector again re-iterated the College's commitment\nto an 'alcohol awareness' cam-pa ign, citing last week's fracas as\nan example for the need to stem\nout the rise of drunken behaviour\nover the past few years.\nMany physics undergraduates\nfeel that the department's social\nfacilities are sorely wanting -there is now only the small and\nuncomfortable basement common room with its poor and\nunreliable food and drink fac ili ties.\nDr David Southwood, head of\nphysics, stated \"I have ... almost\nuniformly received requests that\nthe department ban smoking in\nall public areas\", yet it is estimated that nearly one third of\nphysics students smoke and the\nnumber appears to be growing.\nThe department's decision is be\nan unpopular one and its consequences are likely to be counter\nproductive. The pressure is on\nthe department to find an alternative area.\nBY TOM STEVENS AND ALEX FEAKES\nBar Steward Leaves\nPhil Eatock, a Bar Steward of Da\nVinci's, resigned last week citing\nthe increasing pressures of work\nfor his leaving. Members of the\nbar staff were saddened by his\ndeparture, commenting that he\nwas a capable and well liked col-league.\nRCS Vice-President\nResigns\nThe RCS are left VP-less\nafter the present incumbent,\nRuth Child, resigned last Friday,\njust before the RCS AGM. Although most of the posts at the\nmeeting were filled, no one came\nforward to be the new VP,\ndespite suggestions that a Hall\nRe-app was interested in the job.\nUnion Opt Out\nAvailable\nNigel Wheatley, Assistant\nregistrar, has invited students\nwho wish to 'opt out' of Imperial\nCollege Union to come forward.\nUnder the Conservative\nGovernments' higher education\nreforms of recent years, membership of the University Union\nis no longer automatic. However,\nso few students at IC have\nexpressed an interest in resigning\ntheir membership that Imperial\nstaff assume that all students will\nchoose to remain in ICU unless\nthey indicate otherwise. Last\nyear only two students out of a possible 7500 exercised their\nnew-found rights.\nNonetheless, Matthew\nCrompton, Deputy President\n(Finance and Services) has indicated that only 54% of students\nhave so far come to claim their\nICU membership cards. Union\nstewards will only accept college\nswipe cards as proof of identity\nfor admission to ICU events until\nthe end of November. After this\npoint students will need to have\nunion cards to get in.\nStudents who wish to exercise their right under the\nEducation Act 1994 formally to\nopt out of ICU and CCU mem-ber ship, may now visit their local\nRegistry to record their dec sion. Students are advised that the\nonly practical effect of opting out\nwill be that they cannot stand for\nelected office or take part in\nUnion elections and referenda.\nRCS Homeless\nThe Royal College of\nScience are effectively threatened with eviction from their\ncurrent premises in the Old\nChemistry building. College\nEstates workmen will be cutting\noff all power, water and gas to\nthe Grade II listed building at\nthe end of the month, in preparation for its eventual de moli tion.\nThe RCSU have been having\nlengthy consultations over their\nmove from Chemistry, and had\nbeen offered replacement ac como dati on in a refurbished part of\nCiv Eng. However, the move has\nstalled until discussions over the\nfacilities for the new office,\nincluding a garage for the\nRCSU's Fire Engine mascot, are\nresolved.\nBoating Disaster\nA Rowing Club training excursion went disastrously wrong\nwhen a novice team 'eight' capsized their boat in the middle of\nthe Thames.\nTwo of the club's crews\nwere racing when one of the\nboats lost control and slewed\nsideways. The cox, a novice oarsman himself, could do nothing to\nstop the fast moving current\nfrom taking the boat down-stream. The \u00a310,000 boat collided with a mooring buoy and was\nbroken in half.

When they receive a garbled message to launch a tactical nuclear strike,\ndebate becomes mutiny; Hunter relieves Ramsey\nof command and the crew's loyalty is split. The\nchange of command occurs amid an intense escalation of red alerts, white knuckle developments\nand catastrophes.\nThe script is more entertaining than films normally associated with this genre but ultimately\nfails to create any significant degree of depth,\ndespite doctoring by Quentin Tarantino. Filled\nwith the expected testosterone-charged posturing\nand adrenaline-pumping sequences, this is\nnonetheless one of Tony Scott's best films to date\nand one of the few good action movies this year.\nfilm: il postino.poo ky Based loosely on real life events, the film focuses\non the unlikely friendship between the renowned\nChilean poet Pablo Neruda, exiled in Italy, and his\nsimple stand-in mailman Mario Ruoppolo.\nThe unworldly Mario lets Neruda introduce\nhim to the world of poetry and is soon successfully seducing the local beauty. This is a film of\ncharacter is ation not plot (an unknown phenomenon in Hollywood), helped by two exquisite performances by the leads.\nA charming film in the Cinema Paradiso vein.\nfilm: the usual suspects^\nNot many films can claim such a laid back atmosphere which lulls the viewer into a false sense of\nsecurity right up until the end, when you finally\nlearn the truth. Some may claim that The Usual\nSuspects has that Tarantino feel to it, but this is a truly original affair (and even has a title relevant to\nthe film!).\nRoger Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey) is one of\nthe only two survivors of a shipboard massacre,\nand as he recounts his story to FBI agent Kujan\n(Chazz Palminteri), the story of a Hungarian arch\ncriminal evolves. This is the same crime boss\nwhom Agent Kujan is after, but who may or may\nnot actually exist. Gabriel Byrne also stars as an\nex-cop who reluctantly leads the merry men on\nthe heist.\nThe script is well-planned with twists and\noddball occurrences whacked up on the screen\nwhen you least expect them. Fewer guns and\nmore brains.\nfilm: clueless'spooky\nIn a similar vein to Heathers but considerably less\nsatirical and more lightweight, Clueless pokes gende fun at the rich kids of Beverly Hills.\nAlicia Silverstone plays Cher who, with her\nbest friend Dionne, are the resident ultra-popular\nglamour queens at Beverly Hills High. Cher is\nessentially good-hearted and loves nothing more\nthan using her position to help others, especially in\nmaking over the 'clueless'. But in the process she\nfinds that she is clueless herself, particularly in\nmatters of the heart.\nNothing much really happens but by never\npretending to be more than it is, the film remains\nengaging throughout, is often highly amusing and\neven has some surprisingly sharp observations.\nfilm: the bridges of\nmadison county\nspooky\nThe film version of the best-selling novel has Clint\nEastwood as Robert Kincaid, a National\nGeographic photographer doing a story on covered bridges. After asking directions from an\nItalian-born housewife, Francesca Johnson (Meryl\nStreep), a passionate four day affair begins.\nDespite the ubiquitous crickets and corn-fields, and a disruptive flashback structure\nthrough which Francesca's children discover journals of the affair after her death, Clint Eastwood\nstill knows how to direct. Two fine performances\nfrom the leads help avoid the trap of slushy sent i mentality.\nDespite the obvious turn-off of middle-age\nlove this is still agent ie, tender tale directed with\nstyle.\nfilm: apollo 13magpie A real life disaster story which puts all those 70s movies to shame with its energy and excitement,\nthis is surely one of those films you can't miss.\nApollo 13 is a' do cu drama' of NASAs third expedition to the moon. When a routine stirring of the\noxygen tanks causes an explosion, the crippled\nspacecraft is in danger of never returning home.\nEven though the outcome of the film is\nknown, director Ron Howard is able to maintain\nthe suspense factor during the events in between.\nThe best performance comes from Ed Harris\nwho plays Gene Kranz, the head man at mission\ncontrol whose calmness and leadership never fail\nthe three astronauts.\nThe largest surprise is that all the spectacular\nfootage is original to the film - none of this NASA\narchive business.

For this reason we have decided to\nintroduce an initiation ceremony: drinking a pint a minute until the initiate chucks. We\nchallenge other teams to such events, the\nscoring consisting of the total number of\npints drunk before chucking. We believe this\nwill increase club membership and promote\nthe image of IC as a whole.\nOur race last Wednesday went well, IC\nmen coming 3rd overall, and the women's team coming 2nd.

After an under par first-half, Kendra the 'American Ace'\ncapitalized an a slick passing\nmove. This was followed by a goal from Eva 'the Norwegian\nDaemon'.

    "content": ">in\nMale Genes: A Key to Female Breast Cancer\nOctober was breast cancer awareness month. Bringing the disease to the media forefront, it\nou dined the minimum standards of care that every women should expect. But how many\nmen are aware that they are susceptible too?\nL ast year in Britain, breast cancer\nclaimed the lives of nearly 16,000\nwomen and 98 men. One in every\ntwelve women in the United Kingdom\ncan expect to develop breast cancer at some time in\ntheir life and of these cases 55% will prove to be\nfatal. Only 200 men develop breast cancer each\nyear, but in women the disease is by far the most\ncommon type of cancer, leading to one in five\nfemale cancer deaths.\nAlthough male breast cancer is rare, scientists\nbelieve that a small number of men could potentially hold the key to many inherited breast cancers\nin women. A team of scientists led by\nthe Cancer\nResearch Campaign have been\nworking on\nmale breast\ncancer. Together with\ncolleagues in\nAmerica and\nEurope, they\nhave discovered that BRCA1, the gene thought to be widely\ninvolved in inherited breast cancer, is not responsible in families which include men who suffer from\nthe disease.\nSome breast cancer sufferers are predisposed to\nthe disease due to a genetic susceptibility. In other\nwords, you are\nmore at risk if\nyou have a mother, sister or\ndaughter who\nhas had breast\ncancer and this\nrisk is intensified\nfurther if more\nthan one close relative has been\naffected. The team\nat the Institute of\nCancer Research,\nled by Dr Mike Stratton, set out to examine the role\nof BRCA1 in families which included cases of\nboth male and female breast cancer. The big surprise was that only a small proportion of cases were\ndue to the already cloned BRCA1 gene.\nThey concluded from their research that there\nmust be another 'mystery gene' in addition to\nBRCA1 which, while indicating a genetic predisposition to develop breast cancer, also results in a high risk of male breast cancer.\nResearchers involved in the human genome project are currently working towards the isolation and\nidentification of this mystery gene. They then hope\nto develop a test for the faulty gene, so that those\nwho have inherited the gene could be identified and\noffered screening while those who have not could\nbe reassured.\nAre You At Risk?\nIncreasing age is the\nmost significant factor\nwhich increases the risk\nof developing breast can-cer, but family history, not\nhaving children, starting\nperiods at an early age\nand obesity have all been\nlinked to the disease.\nOther factors, which are\nstill under evaluation,\ninclude:-VHigh fat diet\n^Prolonged use of oral\ncontraception\nVAlcohol\n>/Stress\nBreast cancer - UK19868085+ Low risk for the under 25s: only\n21 cases were reported in 1986\nSeeing Double Saves Lives\nTaking two \\-rav mam mc;i dil fer en l angles instead of one dramatically improves ill-,\nchances of spotting breast tumours. This is the\nfinding of research commissioned by the Breast\nCancer Screening Program, rcp oae d earlier this\nhill i etta Patix, fli cet tor of the program,\nsaid the new method has been practiced by\nscreening centres since August and has resulted\nin the detection of 24% more tumours in over\n50s. However in younger women (who account\nfor a third of all cases) it is much harder to spot\nthe disease. Jullietta explained, \"Screening does-n't work lor under 50s because die breast texture is different, but students at Imperial\nCollege should not worry too much,, thankfully\nbreast cancer in under 25s is very, very un com mon.\" Her advice to all women is to become\nmore 'breast aware', \"If you notice any changes\nsuch as lumps or tough patches of skin you\n'\n\u2022 go straight to your CP.\" Thanks t<>< em treatments, 85% of women now survive the\ndisease, provided it is detected in its early stages.\nMeanwhile, Professor I Iugh Simpson, based\nat Glasgow's Royal Inlin\nspecial bra designed to IT\nbreast temperature.

(Although it must be said that the\ngentleman last year, who declined to drink anything other than\nMarston's Owd Roger, on the grounds that he'd told his wife he'd only have one drink, will remain in my memory for many a year).\nAbove all the beer festival is an enjoyable event and well worth turning up to, if only to get a glass engraved with your name and a quick\npint after lectures finish on Wednesday.\nFriday17 th5 legged pub crawl This is when Raggies go for a wander around as many pubs as possible\nin one evening and get to know the people they are tied to.

    "content": "TWENTY . FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1995 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX: REPLIED TO THIS WEEK BY SIMON BAKER\nA bit of\na Boon\nDear Felix,\nThere are factual inaccuracies that need to be addressed\ninstantly regarding the \"Freddie\nStarr ate my grant\" article. This\ncertainly was a good read but was\nsoured by the presumed views of\nthe Conservative Party on Higher\nEducation. At a recent meeting\nwith the secretary of state for\nSocial Security I was made aware\nof the government's plans. They\nare not to eliminate the grant\ncompletely but to make funds\ngiven to students from loans and\ngrants equal in proportion if they\ncome from a family that has no\nmeans to fund their living\nexpenses. Universities are still\nbeing built and a three-fold\nincrease in student numbers has\nbeen measured in the past sixteen years, on top of all this the\nGovernment can hardly be\naccused of reducing students\nnumbers as many would like to\nbelieve. Now, the Government\nneeds to find the money from\nsomewhere. Raising taxes is out\nof the option as the public would\nvote them out on their tax\nrecord. I maintain that it sounds\nreasonable to ask the future high\nearners of tomorrow to pay an\namount, after all it is the supermarket cashiers and bus drivers\nthat are paying towards our education today.\nDeveloping \"lower-level\"\ncourses, whatever they are, is a matter for each institution. The\ngovernment will rarely intervene\nif courses are felt to have a poor\ncontent, it certainly does not\nencourage \"low level\" courses.\nThe snippets from the\nLabour Party's SBS (Sound Bite\nSnippet) Department can be\ncompletely disregarded. I scoff\npublicly at the meaningless ness of \"seamless robes of learning\"\nand \"learning bank\". Employer\ncontributions for tuition sounds\nlike an excellent idea. Industry in\nthis country is often accused of\nnot investing in the future.\nWhen I meet the Secretary\nof State for Education I shall put\nforward ideas given by Consoc\nstudents: these also include a further promotion of the semester\nsystem and maybe a set of institutions that specialise in teaching\ngraduates only.\nThe fact is that Higher\nEducation is facing considerable\nreform. A process of slow change\nis needed, not radical reform as\nsuggested by some quarters.\nRegards,\nGeoff Boon\nVice Chairman of Consoc.\nAnoth er\nBoon\nOrr, Poor Rachel!\nPortillo just wasn't nice\nenough for you! I 'll make sure the\nnext interviewee will accommodate you on their knee and sing\nsweet rhymes. Now, I don't need\nto tell you this but to get to the\nposition of Secretary if State for\nDefence you need a tough skin. I would think you'd be terribly\nnaive to think he was going to be\na warm homely figure.\nOn a more serious, note, I had hoped for a more enlightening account of your interview\nwith Uncle Mike. There has been\nmore coverage of his personality\nand other side issues than what\nhe actually said.\nRegards,\nGeoff Boon\nVice Chairman of Consoc.\nWhat are you saying, Geoff Michael Portillo is a warm,\nhomely figure. Was ever a man\nmore misunderstood. Honestly,\nhe's all right, but he does tend to\nrub some people up the wrong\nway. Most of what you say is\nfine, although the huge expansion in higher education has\nundoubtedly created some third\nrate institutions offering meaningless degrees. Yes, more good\nquality universities, but not\nrenaming glorified technical col-leg es. And a pint to first person\nwho can tell me what 'seamless\nrobes of learning' means.\nKeep it in\nMind Dear Felix,\nI was pleased to read your\ninteresting article \"It's all in the\nMind\" in last weeks issue. I too\nattended Jeffrey Gray's fascinating lecture, those who are interested in the consciousness debate\nmay like to know that there is\nwork along these lines being done\nhere at Imperial.\nProfessor Aleksander, of the\nElectrical Engineering department has proposed an Artificial\nConsciousness Theorem. From\nthis we are developing a framework to build conscious\nmachines. Anyone who is interested can visit our web site:\nhttp:Awww.ee.ic.ac.uk/research/\nneural/www pages/ NS GTitle\nPage.html.\nYours,\nChris Browne\nNeural Systems Group\nElectrical Engineering\nFascist\nPosters\nDear Felix,\nI can understand that posters\npasted to the outside of college\nare removed. They make the college look untidy and there are\nnotice boards where posters can\nbe put up. It wasn't, therefore,\nsurprising that the Socialist\nWorker posters, pasted outside\nthe Physics Department, only\nremained there briefly. What\ndoes worry me is that the two\nobviously fascist posters have\nbeen on the wall of the Physics\nDepartment for about a month\nand only minor attempts have\nbeen made to remove them. If\nImperial College, over a third of\nwhose students are from over-seas, tolerates this, I don't think I am the only one who should be\nworried.\nC Unwin\nPhysics III\nLetters may be\ncommented on by a guest editor whose\nopinions are not\nnecessarily those of\nthe editor.\nDeadline for letters:\n6pm Monday\nPlease bring your\nunion card for\nidentification.\n\n"

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 OTH 1995 . FIVE\nWhy I love killing small animals\"\nLike hounds tired of the chase,\nthe unwashed ranks of saboteurs\nhave (so far) given up on the\nhunts.\nCynically one may draw the\nassumption that the higher profile (and thus more profitable in\nterms of subscription fees) veal\nexport demonstrations have left\nthe mob tired. Hunting is yesterdays news and more importantly,\nthe bored housewives who so\nvaliantly joined their more vocal\nchildren would be deterred by\nthe prospect of leaping out at\nhorses on a wet Saturday morn-ing.\nThe Greenham Common\ndescendants aren't so clever\nthough (as evidence see how they\ntry to stop trucks in the same\nway as horses). It is more likely\nthat the paradoxes, which lie at\nthe core of single interest issue\ngroups, have defeated the cause\nof the campaigners.\nFor example, town ies complain of clogged B roads that take\nthem to work and back, but they\nwould prefer the countryside\nwasn't carved up as a solution.\nThe yo bs that plant themselves in\ntree tops and construct complex\nunderground warrens in order to\npreserve the countryside have an\ningrained hatred of the traditions\nthat enable the countryside to\nmaintain it's character.\nAnd herein lies the real\nproblem that has nothing to do\nwith preservation or con serva tion. We have become a Virtual\nsociety and thus incapable of\nunderstanding reality. To the\nmediocre urban ites who oppose\nhunting, the countryside is a national park, a mock mediaeval\ninn, replete with brass fixtures\nand (ironically) copious references to hunting. What it most\ndefinitely is not, is a community.\nA working environment. A whole\nsociety which revolves around it's own ancient traditions and battles to maintain it's economic\nhealth.\nFor all the wailing and\nrem on st rations of the dread-locked herd, foxes must be killed\n- they are a pest. If foxes aren't hunted then they would be shot\nor gassed - methods that entail\nsubstantially greater suffering\nthan being instantly killed by\nhounds.\nThe cocktail and clubbing set\nobviously don't see things the\nsame way. They suffer from\n'fluffy animal syndrome' - the\nunshakeable belief that all cuddly\nlooking animals have a right to\nlive regardless of the severe problems that not controlling them\ncan have. They impose their\nviews on the media unfriendly\ncountry dwellers and make no\nattempt to understand their\nways.\nWhat the vociferous opponents really hate are country\nsquires and aristocratic lay about s deriving pleasure from the whole\nprocess. They argue that the animal suffers great stress from\nbeing chased for miles when it\ncould be destroyed instantly, but\nthat misses the point entirely. All\nprey animals (including the\nlambs and chickens killed by\nfoxes) are constantly on the alert\nfor predators. It as they say, in\ntheir genes. Thus their stress is a natural biological state and not\nforeign to them.\nThe ignorance of the protesters is matched only by their\nhypocrisy. Bent double, dirty\nfaced and all facial appendages\npierced, they almost inspire sym-path y. They carry all the evidence of a rough past but scratch\nthe mud away from their cheeks\nand they're as fake as the country\npubs they like to visit. Confused\nyoungsters carrying the emotional burdens of adolescence and the\nmiddle class politically correct\nguilt of their parents, and with a morality based on the inane mut-te rings of transient heroes that\npepper their dormitory walls.\nIn a further twist to confuse\nthe children, parents are now\nwaking to the realisation that\nblood sports and hunting in parA 4 :\n& A& ML Mm m,t icu lar are not that bad - their\nformer standard bearer, James\nBarrington, the Chief Executive\nof the League Against Cruel\nSports recently decided that\nhunting was \"respectable\". His\napostasy follows on the heels of\nhis predecessor, Richard Course.\nThe House of Lords declared a Wild Animals (Protection) Bill as\nunworkable and in order to save\nit, it was shorn of its anti blood\nsports element. A recent Rural\nWhite Paper acknowledged the\nrole of hunting shooting and fishing in the country.\nEven in Africa, the unthinkable is now a reality - game hunting is returning. The conservation\npolicies to support the elephant\nhave been so successful that\nthere are too many of them.\nSome of them are flown to\nnational parks. Others are culled\nin a cold blooded way.\nElsewhere, the natives weary of\ntrying to maintain an agricultural\nexistence with the threat of\nthousands of animals eating them\nand destroying their crops, have\nturned to the market to make a living. Hunters from America pay\nup to five thousand dollars a day\nto track wildebeest and shoot\nthem. The numbers set aside for\nhunting are strictly controlled\nand in any one area amount to no\nmore than 0.5% of the pop ul a tion.\nIn Africa, as in the English\ncountryside, there is a different\nset of ethical principles that dictates the treatment of animals\nand it is a system based on the\nunique experiences and problems\nof the region. Hippopotamus\nmay be majestic and cuddly\nbeasts but they kill over 300\nAfricans a year. We are fortunate\nin not having to contend with\nmigrating bison interfering with\nour daily lives. The imposition of\none set of (Western) principles\nderived from David\nAttenborough documentaries,\nonto the natives smacks of\nColonial missionary activity and\nthe charge applies equally to\nthose who see our own countryside as an Arcadia devoid of any\nharsh reality.\nThe turning of the tide will\nundoubtedly cause hassles for\nMr. Blair, who is committed to a ban on hunting, not least because\nthe nations three million anglers\nhave joined the hunters and now\nrepresent a significant voting\ngroup peddling their own inter-est s. The formation of the apolitical Countryside Movement by\nan American lawyer, Eric\nBettelheim, under the\nChairmanship of Sir David Steel\nadds further momentum to the\ncause of the rustics.\nThe country bumpkins have\nturned on the pack and the chase\nhas only just begun. It will be a bloody and hard fought fight\nwhich will see the end of one\nparty. You can be sure of one\nthing though, death will, regret-t ably, not be instant and painless.\n\"If foxes aren't hunted then they would\nbe shot or gassed - methods that\nentail substantially greater suffering\nthan being instantly killed by hounds/'\n\n"

Just remember that in a few months, or\nmaybe even a few years time, when the music\npress are wetting themselves over a young\nBrummie band and gushing forth phrases like,\n\"the best band this country has produced for\nyears\"... just remember that you read it here\nfirst.\nNow you might just be if tin king, \"Calm\ndown and take a cold shower,\nVik.\" Then\nagain you might\njust be nodding\nyour head sage-ly and mumbling quietly,\n\"Yep. He's lost\nit.\" But, please,\nlet's look at the\nevidence.\nDissident\nProphet were\nsigned after only\ntheir second gig when they weren't even a proper band and were still playing for a laugh. Good\nstart. They've released a single called\n'Generation X' that weaves golden threads of\nloud guitars and says more as an observation of\nyouth culture than most bands will fool themselves into thinking they're doing in a lifetime.\nStill going strong.\nLive, they excel and play like their lives\ndepended on it, even when faced with at him ble-ful of locals at a pub like The Swan in\nFulham. Andy Jennings is one of a very rare\nbreed - a vocalist with a supremely melodic voice\nthat actually sounds purer and more wholesome\non stage than on disc. Tom Livermore is the best\nguitarist I 've heard in aeons. Loud, soft, ag gres sive, pensive. You name it, he plays it. Not that\nthis is some Eric Clapton or Joe Satriani, self-styled guitar guru whose artistic, musical head\ngot lost up a rear passage long ago. No, this is\nsomeone with a God-given talent who's using it\nto imbue, embellish and deliver the band's music\nwith soul, gut. feeling and splendour. And then\nthere's Simon\n'Smudge' Smith\nand John Large\nwho could probably keep a rhythm going if\nthey were playing in a band\nwith a couple of\ntone-deaf, musical heathens.\nWhich they\naren't, as you\nknow. Case\nalmost closed. .\nAnd if you don't care about any of the above\nthen listen to the songs, all of them necessary and\nsufficient for any condition. Witness\n'Unconditional love' and truly understand the\nmeaning of the word beauty. An epic that speaks\nthe gospel tm th when many around are feeding\nus with lies, it builds from an awe-inspired peace\nto a climax that wall send shivers up your spine\nbut leave you feeling warm inside. Truth and\nbeauty. What more could you need? Verdict: the\nbest new band in Britain. Case dismissed. (11?)\n\u2022album: dub star disgrace-Once in a while, an album come along that dispels all previous perceptions and blurs the significance of the boundaries dividing rock, indie\nand pop. Even the guitars will not be missed\nbecause the essence of all that we love in music\nis there. 'Disgraceful' is an album that captures\nmusic at one of its glorious moments and provides a great relief from all the pop music blaring from the radios.\nIt is almost too embarrassing to admit that I like Dubstar. Sarah Blackwood's voice simply\nembraces you with a renewed sense of child-like\noptimism. Steve Hillier and Chris Wilkie provide the musical landscape to complete a world\nthat pop so often claims to achieve but usually\nfails.\nDelving into the lyrics, tales of casual sex,\nphysical violence and possibly even the end of\nthe world start to emerge. It will probably leave\nyou humming the phrase, \"I 'll watch the stars go\nout\", silly before the meaning of it finally hits\nyou.\nThere is a certain depth to Dubstar's songs\nthat belies their music. If the Manic Street\nPreachers are about life at its brutal tm th, and\nDrugstore are about the life we live, then\nDubstar are probably about living and embracing\nlife with a smile. While that may be too nice for\nsome, it will probably balance out all the pain and\ndrudgery of life that fills up your average,\nrespectable CD collection.\n'Not manic now' is playing on the air. Listen\nand decide. It is simply a lovely record. (7)\n\n"

This started with\nthe brass monkey regatta organised by\nOxford University. It was a tough event due\nto the cold and total lack of wind, and a real\ntest of stamina for those poor sailors who get\naway with sailing in shorts and a harness back\nhome, but IC won the event.\nNext was the Veloce challenge organised\nby Cambridge at Grafham reservoir. One of\nour sponsors, Bic sports, provided brand new\nboards with brand new sails for the event. We\nwere the first people to sail them in the UK.\nThe racing was very close and required\ngreat commitment from the London team\nwhich contained many an Imperial sailor. The\nUniversities were fighting it out for two\ndistinct trophies: the Loxbridge cup, a closely-fought contest between Oxford\nCambridge and London, whilst the overall\ncup (a natty little silver one) can be won by\nany University team. London won both cups\nthis year. This on top of the fact that London\nhas won the Loxbridge cup two years running\nshould make for an interesting fight this year.\nDuring the Easter holiday the club\nentered the BUSA competition at Christchurch. In gusty offshore winds Imperial\nfought hard, and won division two in the\ncourse racing. Then came the mother of all\nstudent events: the Clacton National Student\nWindsurfing Championships. IC dominated\nthe volleyball court but lost one of our best\nsailors to a broken thumb, and this might\naccount for our lower position in the racing.\nThe a pre s windsurfing was very good and we\nenjoyed ourselves at the Mayor's civic\nreception and the night-club afterwards.\nI can't stress enough the fact that\nstudent windsurfing is about good times in\nthe evening with epic days on the water.\nDon't worry about being good at the sport as\nall events cater for beginners. The club also\nhas a heavy schedule of fun trips to a variety\nof locations. For more information then\ncontact cn@ic.ac.uk or pop a message in the\nChem Eng pigeon hole addressed to Chris\nNewlands Chem Eng IV, or the athletic clubs\npigeon hole under B for board sailing. Bust-a gut\nFirst up at last week's National comedy\nnetwork was Jason Freeman, who has a mixed start with a predictable-but-good set;\n\"I bought my fox a new leg for his birthday.\nI bought it from the Body Shop, but they\ndon't test on animals so when I got it home\nit didn't fit.\" On the whole most of the time\nwas spent waiting for him to get to the\npoint, which is a shame as warm-up acts\nshould really be a little more punchy.\nAt this point the interval arrived and I turned around to see that the ents lounge\nwas almost at capacity, with people sitting\non any flat surface. Alan Parker's reputation\nand previous performances were obviously\nthe main pull for the evening. Unobtrusively\non stage himself to set up his props, he\nlooked distinctly Mark Horne-esque in his\nclothing. The next time I saw Alan he was\ndressed for his act, with awareness ribbons\neverywhere, wild-eyed and with the mother\nof all bad hair days. His show was typically\nmanic and fast-paced, and if you see him\nagain I recommend the third row at the\nclosest - this is a scary guy. He was also\nextremely funny, finally bringing the\naudience to life and even being heckled.\nThe evening was good value at \u00a32.50\nbut it was a shame that the first acts were so\nlacklustre in comparison to Parker.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS FELIX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 1 0 TH1995. THREE\nHEFCE Funding Drops\nFresher\nDeath\nBY MARK BRIDGE\nAnisha Dixit, a First Year\nInformation Systems Engineering student, died from pneumonia at the Royal Brompton\nHospital last Tuesday. Her family flew in from India to be with\nher just before her condition\ndetonated and she passed away.\nShe had been feeling\nunwell during the first few\nweeks of term and went to stay\nwith her aunt. However, shortly\nafter seeing her GP she was\nadmitted to Kingston General\nHospital, from where she was\ntransferred to the Royal\nBrompton.\nA little over a week later she\nwent into coma. After doctors\nexplained how speaking to the\ncomatose might help them,\nfriends from Tizard, the hall\nAnisha lived in, went to see her\nand talk to her, sometimes\nthrough the night. Unfortunately, Anisha died four days\nlater.\nAnisha came to Imperial\nCollege from Wimbledon High\nSchool, were she was an outgoing student who achieved excellent A level results. She was'\nhighly spoken of, and many of\nher friends, members of staff,\nand old school-day friends were\npresent at her side during her\nlast few days.\nJohn Hassard, Warden of\nTizard Hall, spoke of her kind\nand helpful nature and the deep\nsense of loss that was felt for her\nat the hall.\nMargaret Cunningham, the\nSenior Tutor on her course, was\npresent at her funeral. She related how her father sang a beautiful moving rhythmic recitation\nin Anisha's memory.\nAnisha was cremated, and\nher ashes taken to India to be\nscattered in the river Ganges,\nthe great river that is sacred to\nHindus.\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY The Higher Education Funding\nCouncil for England has recently\nannounced its final grant allocations for 1995-6, which see\nImperial College receiving only a small increase in funding. Though\nIC is getting a0.5% increase in\nwhat HEFCE calls \"Transitional\nRelief\", which will be cut next\nyear and be reduced to zero the\nfollowing year, the actual grant\nitself has fallen by 0.7%, which\nsome believe represents a \"drop\nin real terms\".\nTalking to Felix, the Pro-Rector\nfor Educational Quality,\nProf.Alan Swanson, said that the\ndrop could be attributed to various factors. \"They [HEFCE]\nhave a formula for allocating...\nthere are quality measures and\nvolume measures\". Quality mea-sure s, he added, are conducted\nevery four years and an assessed\ndepartment then receives a rating\nout of 5 for its work, and it is this\nrating that is a multiplier for\nreceiving research money. The\nVolume Measure is measured\nannually, and IC has in recent\nyears suffered in areas influencing this. One factor was the\ndeparture of senior staff for\nother institutions, which in\nrecent years has included Prof.\nPatrick Dowling, former head of\nCivil Engineering, becoming vice-chancellor of Surrey University.\nWhilst he felt that this in some\nways put Imperial in a good light,\nhe said, \"We have a lot of good\npeople who are attracted by juicier plums elsewhere.\" Moreover,\nhe added that some of the \"bright\npromising younger people\" who\nhave since replaced them would\nonly perhaps start to show the\nsame amount of output as their\npredecessors in later years, in\nareas such as research, in order\nfor there to be an improvement\nin a department's rating. He\nwent on to say that improvements had been implemented in\norder to raise the quality mea-sure, such as the setting up of\nGovernor's Lectureships, set up\nin response to \"departments feeling the pressure of high staff-stu-dent ratios\". About 30 such lec-ture ships have already been given\nout and \"are already showing\npromise\". With the various\nimprovements in mind, Prof.\nSwanson was confident that any\nfunding drops, however minor,\nwould eventually sort themselves\nout. Assessments, he added,\nforced departments to re-exam-ine their strategies and improve,\nparticularly in areas like research:\n\"A certain amount of pressure is\ngood,\" he said. But he dispelled\nsuggestions that it was becoming\neasier for departments to\nimprove their ratings as they\ncame to know more about how\nassessment procedures operated,\nContinued on page 4\nBen Turner, ICU Deputy President (1990 - 91), enjoyed proving what great jobs IC graduates can get\nas he represented his firm, Andersen Consulting, at the 1995 Career's Fair.\nBY JO PLUMBLEY\nFor those looking forward to graduating in the near future, the 1995 Careers Fair offered the chance to\nhunt out a suitably fulfilling post for the time to follow. A wide range of companies were invited, although\nome students noted a bias toward Information Technology placements rather than Engineering and Science\nprogrammes. The companies seemed generally impressed with the outstanding quality of the students, and\nstudents likewise were pleased with the companies available to them. Both, however, were united in their\nopinion that splitting the venue over more than one room made it impossible to negotiate a quick tour, and\nputting time delays on finding a firm made the event more tedious and tiring than it need have been.\n\n"
