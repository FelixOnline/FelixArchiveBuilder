Jeffery Marlow\u2019s blog of the trip proves insightful\nMarch 28th\nGood news and bad news today on the Drake. The good news is that ol Sir\nFrancis has been relatively kind, with \u201cDrake Lake\u201d conditions prevailing for\nmost of the day, and most of the team is doing just fine. The bad news is that\nI am sadly not one of that unaffiliated majority. After wrestling a bout of seasickness this morning, I ultimately chose to bite the proverbial bullet and take\nsome anti-nausea medication. Why, you might ask, did I not do so pre-emptively, knowing that we were headed into the most notorious\nwaters in the world? That\u2019s a good question, and as I examined the\nceiling tiles above my couch / bed for several hours, I managed\nto mine the depths of my misguided psyche to come up with an\nanswer.\nBack in grad student world, the routine of daily life is pretty\ncomfortable, and I\u2019ve been anticipating the opportunity to test\nmy limits. Well, they\u2019ve been tested, and on the seasickness\nfront, they\u2019re pretty weak. But at least I know that now, and\nI have a better sense of my physical limits and capabilities.\nSadly, my physical challenges have made it difficult for me to\npursue the abundant intellectual challenges present on the\nship. We\u2019ve divided into teams to pursue various themes\ncentred around climate change, and I\u2019ve been feeling\nguilty for abandoning my wonderful Interdependencies\nTeam. Somehow they\u2019re managing without me.\nIn other news, we got news this evening that we\u2019re\nin the process of crossing the Antarctic Convergence,\nwhere water temperature plummets and we officially\nenter the Antarctic ecosystem. It\u2019s not every day that\none gets to say that we are now officially within the\nAntarctic sphere of influence.\nMarch 29th\nDay 2 of our initial Drake\nPassage crossing, and\nthings have taken a\nturn for the worse: we\u2019re\nofficially in the biggest\nstorm of the year, with\nfrothing 40-foot waves\npassing by our 4th-floot\nwindows. Let\u2019s just say it\nwasn\u2019t the most productive\nday of the voyage, but it certainly has been an adventure.\nAnyway, today we\u2019ve got\nsome thoughts from guest\nblogger Tiffany Vogel, the lead\nsinger of the newly formed band,\n\u201cBronco 5.\u201d Take it away Tiffany.\n-----------------------Today, the Drake finally decided to conspire and collaborate with the wind\nand in doing so, they have self-or- ganized into the strongest and mightiest of swells this\npassage has seen all season. This Ant- arctic rite of passage has fully manifested itself in the form of\nseasickness. It appears most of us have drowsily retreated into cabin hibernation mode, especially since we have\ncrossed the Antarctic convergence zone and woke up to the news that we are in gail 9 winds (hurricanes are about gail 12)\nand that we must temporarily hold steady and refrain from pushing ahead.\nI write to you from my little bunk in the Ioffe where I sway back and forth not from overtaking the waves in the name\nof progress, but by floating respectfully and humbly with engines silent in hopes that the mighty Drake will show eventual\nmercy. This setback means will we not reach Antarctica as scheduled, rather we will lose half a day on \u201cthe Ice\u201d as we precariously pass the Drake. Although this could be processed as a disappointment, I could hardly call this a setback. In fact, I\nwouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nWe, as humans, are all too accustomed to setting our owns schedules and working to our own watches. Here on Ioffe, we\nfind ourselves stranded on a small floating island in the irrational swells of the Southern ocean. There is no negotiating, no\nart of persuasion, or charming outreach to the Drake. The message is walloped back in the simplest of terms: for probably\nthe first and last time for many of us, the Drake represents the unique condition when we are completely subserviant to the\nenvironment. We are reduced to the most primitive forms of environmental determinism and I thank the storm for unsen-sitively reminding me of this. We work on the Drake\u2019s clock, not our own, and the journey of the Drake is just as important\nto understand Antartica as Antarctica itself. Here, I cannot run away from challenges and if I bristle, it will have to be within\nthe bounded rational walls of the Ioffe. I must come to terms with the Drake, and although I cannot make choices of what is\nhappening around me, I CAN choose how to deal with the circumstances. Coming to this humbling understanding is a major part of the mental game needed to overcome anxious forms of seasickness. I welcome\nthe storm. Recognizing and accepting my powerlessness has never been more enlightening\nor liberating, but then again, bear in mind this comes from a \u2018non- seasickeningly\u2019\nperspective.\n------------------------Update: the storm subsided in the wee hours of the\nmorning, and we\u2019ve just sighted land! The winds are\nfrigid up on the top deck, our route is framed by cliffs\nof ice and rocky shores. We\u2019ll be making our first landing in a few hours at King George Island, having survived the infamous Drake Passage.\nMarch 31st\nWell folks, things have officially gone meta on the expedition. After several days\nof being encouraged to consider climate change issues, network with peers and\nexperts, and soak in the moment, we seem to have reached a tipping point where\nexcessive self-reflection has yielded some sort of collective short circuit. Of\ncourse, it\u2019s all part of the \u201cbeautiful chaos\u201d that has enveloped the expedition: with\nso many remarkable people in such a stunning environment (there\u2019s a humpback\nwhale outside my cabin window at the moment, for those of you keeping score),\nit\u2019s hard to know how to spend our hours. Or should we even question that process \u2013 would it be wiser to let the waves of confusion and neurosis wash over our\nhyperawareness? Maybe just by looking at the daily rhythms in the first place,\nwe\u2019re submitting to the structured regime we\u2019ve hoped to escape in this \u201copenframework\u201d style expedition. Whoa.\nAll joking aside, the morning \u201creflection\u201d session was extremely useful \u2013 a maddening mix of enlightenment and frustration similar to an initial viewing of Memento. We even had a bit of civil disobedience when a few expeditioners walked\nout to go look at icebergs. To be fair, it can hardly be called disobedience when\nthe entire expedition is a free-flowing evolution of ideas and directives, but there\nwas a touch of tension. It\u2019s hard to say right now what exactly I\u2019ve gained from\nthe \u201cprocess\u201d side of the expedition, but I can sense the eventual lessons will be\napplicable to nearly all aspects of my life.\nIntermission: there are 7 penguins swimming outside my window now. Count\nit.\nAnyway, all signs of tension melted away with an absolutely exhilarating zodiac\ncruise through Wilhelmina Bay. I hate to say it dear reader, but describing the\nmorning\u2019s experience is an exercise in futility: there is simply no way to convey\nthe richness of life, the purity of nature, and the inspired mood of the team that\ncame together for a few hours this morning. Needless to say, however, I\u2019m going\nto give it a shot.\nHumback whales an arm\u2019s length from the boat. A rusting shipwreck framed\nby cliffs of ice. Cue the sun, part the clouds. Fur seals waddling and sliding to\ncome check us out. Ice-encapsulated mountains in the distance. Skimming the\nfrigid water, wind blowing through our hair. Sea-salt perfume. Icebergs carved\nand chisled by wind and waves. A sleeping whale awakened by an idling motor.\nUnforgettable memories.\nApril 1st\nYou can always tell the first-time visitors to Yellowstone National Park by the cars\nthat pull over to the side of the road for bison. A bison poking out through the\ntrees a hundred yards away? Pull over. A herd of the animals grazing across the\nvalley? Pull over. A picture of a bison on a sign? Pull over. Tires screech, windows\nroll down, and the cameras come out. Of course, veteran visitors, those who have\nbeen in the park a day or two, don\u2019t bother with such things; they have learned\nthat the bison are everywhere, and a photograph without one would be the real\nanomaly.\nDuring this morning\u2019s excursion to Neko Harbor, most of the group reached the\nstatus of veteran Antarctica visitors. Yesterday afternoon, we simply couldn\u2019t stop\nphotographing the thousands of gentoo penguins waddling around us. Penguins\nflapping, penguins sliding, penguins eating snow \u2013 believe me folks, we\u2019ve\ngot photos of it all. But today, the cameras were laregly focused elsewhere.\nIt\u2019s not that we were sick of the penguins, but rather that they were more\na part of the landscape, a piece of the greater Antarctic experience and not\na destination in themselves. This place is an intricate sea-based ecosystem,\nand the penguins are just a single piece, albeit an adorable one, of the larger\npuzzle.\nIn other news, we\u2019ve struck it rich again today with the weather. Not a cloud\nin the sky as the zodiacs left the mothership, and as we now cruise toward Paradise Bay, the bright sun glints off the\nglassy water and scalloped icebergs. The\nnear absence of wind has even tempted\nsome to consider sunbathing (jokingly I\npresume). And tonight\u2019s order of business is camping on the ice, a truly rare experience that will be a continual struggle\nbetween the yin of Antarctic beauty and\nthe yang of encroaching hypothermia.\nWish us luck!\nApril 3rd\nFreestyling it today, in keeping with the general mood on board the ship. Some\nthoughts:\nCamping on the ice a couple of nights ago was an adventure. The setting was\nunbelievable: a small island dome of ice in the middle of a harbor ringed by four\nrocky pinnacles. Once the sun went down, the starscape was the best I\u2019d ever\nseen, with shooting stars and satellites criss-crossing the sky every few minutes.\nA fun game the next time you\u2019re bored at a cocktail party: go around to each\ngroup, gently insert yourself, contribute one appropriate thought relevant to the\ndiscussion, and subtly extract yourself. It\u2019s a great way to get a sense of a group,\nespecially if you\u2019ve got a short attention span. Maria and I pioneered this activity\nduring the night on the ice, experiencing a full range of convserations, from the\nmeaning of life (one of those things you know will come up in such a gorgeous\nsetting), to how to get into a sleeping bag (you\u2019d be surprised), to worst pick-up\nlines.\nOn a related note, the group reflected on the dichotomy of simplicity and complexity associated with the expedition. Simple: we\u2019re 80-odd people on a boat,\nmoving across the ocean toward our destination. Complicated: we\u2019re also 80-odd vessels of swerving dreams, ambitions, and capabilities, and it\u2019s overwhelming to think about mapping those discrete movements into anything remotely\ncoherent.\nI was playing a game of sardines last night (I swear I\u2019ve done more than just\nplay during the last week!), and it got to be my turn to hide. I chose the bridge\n\u2013 the part of the boat where our Russian captains steer us through the roughest\nwaters on Earth. The sun had long since gone down, and the bridge had the feel\nof a movie set, with only fluoescent lights on navigation consoles silhouetting the\nsailors. Looking out to sea, a huge foglight on the mast looked out into the mists\nand dark waters ahead, illuminating the odd bird in the distance. It was spatially\ndisorienting, giving an impression of flotation and suspension. Fortunately no\none found me.\nI wish I knew Russian: the crew on this ship must have great stories to tell.\nWe\u2019re in full-fledged \u201cconference mode\u201d on the Ioffe today, with stimulating\ngroup meetings and seminars filling the day. We\u2019ve questioned the basis of western civilization, shared our own personal stories, and debated the issues. I\u2019ve also\nhad a chance to sit down with a few of the experts individually, which is a bit like\ndrinking from a firehose. The point is that I think I\u2019ve finally come to understand\nthe challenge of the expedition.\nLet me back up. I\u2019ve done a touch of mountaineering and skiing and general\noutdoorsiness in cold places, so I was a bit skeptical of this whole \u201cAntarctic Expedition\u201d thing. It\u2019s not like we were trekking across the continent. And in reality,\nthis has been a tourist trip, at least as Antarctic trips go. Our guide Graham has\ntrouble keeping a smirk off his face every time one of us refers to this \u201cexpedition.\u201d\nTurns out it is an expedition, just not a physical one. The problems of climate\nchange are so immense, this experience has really been about harnessing the intellectual capital and know-how among this group\nto do something about them.\nThe intellectual expedition has just\nbegun.\nMarch 27th\nAfter months of anticipation, thousands of miles of travel, and two days of\nteam building, our team has finally set sail for Antarctica. At approximately 4\nPM, the Academic Ioffe pushed off from the dock and we said our goodbyes\nto Ushuaia (a town more affectionately referred to among team members as\n\u201cUsh\u201d). The communal sense of excitement and anticipation was palpable on\nthe uppermost deck, the wind whipping our hair and the occasional raindrops\nspraying our faces. A few minutes later, we spotted the first wildlife of the\ntrip \u2013 seals dipping in and out of the Beagle Channel water escorting us out to\nsea. In the distance, several pods followed suit, like shiny black rocks skipping\nacross a pond.\nBut the storm clouds are gathering already as we make our way toward\nthe infamous Drake Passage. The first raindrops have just started splattering\nagainst the windows, and the dark clouds are billowing up ahead. The 2041\nteam is warning us of \u201crough\u201d seas, which, in the understated habit of the sea-worn, roughly translates to \u201cwaves the size of skyscrapers.\u201d\nTo be honest, the volatility of the Drake has been one of the big draws for\nme. As a student of explorations past, I\u2019ve read about this stretch of water time\nafter time in stories of great voyages. Nowhere else on Earth are storms so violent so often. The Drake is also a wall of sorts, an effective challenge separating\nthe civilized world from the utterly alien.\nThis journey across the Drake is shaping up to be an\u2026interesting one (in the\nBritish sense of the word). The bouyant excitement of our departure has subtly transformed into a sort of giddy apprehension. Most of the team appears\nready, if a bit hesitant, to endure the worst of what the Drake has to offer. For\nmy part, I\u2019m starting to question my (stubborn? lazy?) choice to forego motion\nsickness medicines. I\u2019ve been looking forward to the high seas of the Drake\nPassage for months, but we\u2019ll see just how enthusiastic I am tomorrow\u2026\nANTARCTICA\nFact File\nArea (Overall): 14,000,000 km2\nPermanent Population: 0\nResearchers: ~1000\nAntarctica is the fifth largest\ncontinent and has seven official\nterritories that are shared between\nCanada, Australia, Argentina,\nChile, New Zealand, France and\nthe UK.\nBrazil has also made a claim to\nsome of the land, which has added\nfriction between nations as there\nare already some territories that\noverlap.\nThe Antarctic Treaty was signed in\n1959 by twelve countries; to date,\nforty-six countries have signed the\ntreaty. The treaty prohibits military\nactivities and mineral mining,\nsupports scientific research, and\nprotects the continent\u2019s ecozone.\nOngoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists of many nationalities and with\ndifferent research interests.\nA total of 37,506 tourists visited\nduring the 2006\u201307 Austral summer with nearly all of them coming\nfrom commercial ships. The\nnumber is predicted to increase\nto over 80,000 by 2010.There has\nbeen some recent concern over\nthe potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused\nby the influx of visitors. A call\nfor stricter regulations for ships\nand a tourism quota have been\nmade by some environmentalists and scientists.\n\n"

An\noutbreak was said to have started in\nlaboratories residing within the basement floor.\nFire alarms meant the entire building was evacuated immediately, prior\nto the call to the London Fire Brigade\n(LFB). Despite the limited size of the\nfire, a total of six fire engines arrived\nat the Prince Consort Road entrance.\nThe site of multiple fire engines caused\nsome concern amongst passing students and staff, but the chemical-based\nnature of work within the building\nmeant standard cautionary measures\nrequire several LFB units to on scene.\nA similar site on campus was seen\nin March 2007 when a chemistry lab\non the third floor of the RCS building\nset alight but was reduced within ten\nminutes.\nA larger fire occurred two months\nearlier as the London Fire Brigade\nworked throughout the night to put\nout an extensive fire on the Albert Hall\nRSM ablaze. Ish. Sort of. Eh\nMansions, a residential block overlooking Beit Quad. Much alike these\nincidents, the fire in the RSM caused\nno casualties.\nImmediate disruption was felt by local residents on Friday night; the obstruction of the six fire engines and\nthen the subsequent partial cordoning\noff of Prince Consort Road.\nA week on, and little to no further\ndisruption to College life has occurred,\napart from the general consensus of\nworry that Materials students are\nbecoming ever-increasing liabilities\naround College.\nPhoto by Mico tatalovic\nIt\u2019s election time again\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nMain Dining\nHall closed until\nSeptember 2009\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nPope Benedict XVI has been on his first\npilgrimage to the Middle-East this past\nweek as leader of the Catholic Church.\nHis itinerary encompassed Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian territory, holding meetings with leaders from all three,\nand he celebrated a Mass in Bethlehem,\nJosaphat Valley, and Nazareth. One of the\nmain aims of the pontiff on his visit is to\npreserve a diminishing Christian presence in the Holy Land, as he urged for\nreconciliation between the three Abrahamic faiths (Christianity, Islam and\nJudaism). During a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, the\npope offered his support for Palestinians\u2019 right to a homeland.\nBenedict\u2019s presence in Israel has provoked some rows to flare however, including over his membership to the Hitler Youth in Germany (to which he\nsaid he was forcefully subscribed) in the 1940s, and the Vatican\u2019s imminent\nbeatification of Pope Pius XII, who failed to speak out against the Holocaust\nduring his reign which spanned WWII.\nIsreal\nIndia\u2019s month-long general election has almost come to an end.\nWith a population of 1.1 billion people of whom 714 million are eligible\nvoters, making it the most populous democracy in the world, the task or\norganising India\u2019s elections has been gargantuan. To cope, voting days have\nbeen staggered over the course of a month to allow election officials and security personnel to move across the country.\nThis week voters in the last few remaining states cast their ballot, allowing\nthe counting process to begin this Saturday 16 May, and the numerical results\nto be announced early on Sunday.\nThe numbers will determine the proportion of the 543 seats in the Lok\nSabha (lower house of parliament) awarded to the ruling UPA or opposition\nNDA coalitions, and to smaller left-wing and regional political parties.\nIndia\nThis Tuesday, Japan and Russia have\nstruck a nuclear energy deal, and\nvowed to end a long-standing territorial dispute through any diplomatic\nmeans necessary.\nWhen Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Vladimir\nPutin met his Japanese counterpart Taro\nAso in Tokyo, both reiterated the importance of strengthening economic ties between their nations. The energy deals include an oil exploration agreement,\nand the exchange of Japanese nuclear technology for a secure supply of Russian uranium.\nJapan and Russia still lack a post-war peace treaty, since they have never\nsettled the dispute over a group of four islands, which Japan calls the Northern Territories, and Russia calls the Southern Kurils. These strategic islets in\nthe Pacific Ocean have been administered by Moscow ever since they were\ncaptured by Soviet forces at the end of WWII.\nJapan and Russia\nImperial doctorate student Tom\nWhyntie is single-handedly improving Imperial\u2019s reputation as a teaching\nuniversity with his progression into the\nfinals of Nesta FameLab.\nFirst held in 2005, FameLab is a national competition which attempts to\nfind the best science presenter in the\ncountry. Contestants are limited to a\nthree minute presentation of topics of\ninterest, with finalists getting a chance\nto talk at the Cheltenham Science Festival in the summer.\nThe Cambridge physics graduate,\ncurrently based at CERN in Geneva,\nwon first place in the Oxford regional\nheat and secured himself a place in the\nnational finals to be held on June 5th.\nWhyntie is no stranger to giving complex issues a user-friendly feel, having\ngiven humorous, informal lectures on\nhis research work all over the country.\nHis guest talk to the Imperial Physics\nSociety last December drew a large\ncrowd who welcomed a discussion\ncombining a topical stand-up routine\nwith the intricacies of high-energy\nphysics research.\nAll of us at felix wish him the best of\nluck in June.\nGilead Amit\nAssociate Editor\nImperial\nstudent in\nFameLab final\nDan Wan\nEditor-in-Prowling\nYou would have thought that the Sabbatical elections would be the last election for some time.

It is rumoured that\nAfonso Campos, current Chair and\nPresidential candidate until he with-drew, is standing for the position again\nthis year, however, he might have some\nstiff opposition from current Medical\nPresident, Mark Chamberlain, who is\nalso rumoured to be standing for the\nposition. Nominations for these positions close on the 20th May and voting\nopens on the 29 May until the 2 June.\nThe ICSMSU elections are already\nin full swing, with one set of hustings\nhaving already taken place. The full list\nof candidates can be seen to the right,\nand the those of you with a keen eye,\nor more likely, those of you who have\nbeen here for a while, we see a familiar name running for the Presidential\nposition. The reason that the ICSMSU\nelections are held separately from the\ncentral union and faculty elections\nis due to the nature of the Medical\nSchool\u2019s timetables.\nMany are hoping for a strong turnout\nin all elections this term, especially the\nPresident\nAnil Chopra\nDeputy President\nRichard Hewitt\nSites & Services Officer\nAbubakar Mohammed\nAlumni & Careers Officer\nAlexander Walls\nAlexandra Perkins\nSecretary\nRosemarie Richards\nTreasurer\nJack Roberts\nAcademic Officer (Years 1 & 2)\nShah Mubeen Rahman\nGayathri Rajasooriar\nAlexander Ross\nAcademic Officer (Year 4, Biomedical Sciences & Pharmacology)\nOsayuki Nehikhare\nNatalie Kernan\nAcademic Officer (Years 3, 5 & 6)\nAfsoon Sepahzad\nWelfare Officer\nKathryn Wright\nHerjyot Dharni\nTiffany Munroe-Gray\nHeather Powell\nClubs & Societies Officer\nCatherine Atkin\nRAG Chair\nSarah Hancox\nMichael Smith\nKush Naker\nSummer Ball Chair\nMichael Hewitt\nEntertainments Chair\nDavid Smith\nThomas Badenoch\nSocial Secretary\nSandeep Dubb\nLindsay Hennah\nAislinn O\u2019Malley\nICSMSU\nElections 2009\nCandidates\nGSA ones which have had difficulties\nin the past with positions, including\nthe GSA Chair, not being filled until\nthe first term of the following academic term.

Judge Richard Waldie\nobviosuly impressed, suggested at one\npoint to \u201cClose your eyes and feel the\nmagic...\u201d.\nFinally pop-rock band Cosmo Jones\n(who describe their music on their Facebook page as \u2018(Cos)motown\u2019...) jaunted onto stage. Their fun attitude got\nthe judge\u2019s attention and their upbeat\nmelodies got the judge\u2019s toes tapping.\nCosmo Jones, consisting of Spaden\nElmhirst (Bass, Vocals); Rob Wall\n(Drums, Vocals) and Mick Morrison\n(Guitar, Vocals), ultimately took first\nprize because the judges decided that\nthe band\u2019s music and energy would\nbest suit an opening act of the Summer\nBall and get people dancing.\nThe 2nd heat will be on the 14th of\nMay, after this issue is sent to print so\ncheck out next week\u2019s felix to see the\nresults. There is one more heat on the\n21st of May in dBs before the grand finals on the 29th of May.\nOne of President Obama\u2019s key election pledges, legislation to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions from US industry, is making progress.\nThe House of Representative, the lower house of Congress, is currently debating a bill on climate-change, which includes a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system, the\nfirst of its kind in America. Negotiations have produced some compromises\nin order to gain approval of Democrat and Republican members whose states\nrely on coal or heavy industry. The vote on the bill is expected next week,\nand if it passes, it must still be debated in the Senate, the upper house, before\nbecoming law.\nThe Obama administration wants to push this bill through so the US has a\nlegislative framework for regulating emissions before December 2009. This\nis when the UN Climate Change conference will take place in Copenhagen,\nto draft a follow-up agreement to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol which the US\ninfamously did not ratify.\nUSA\nThe glowing bright lights coming from the windows are definitely not from flames\n\u201ctheir upbeat\nmelodies got\nthe judge\u2019s toes\ntapping\u201d\n\n"

Stainthorp had just crossed\nthe finish in the beginner 8+ and had\nto dash into the quad. After a desperate push-off, bow Tamsin Bromley\nreported the steering to have ceased\nfunctioning. Already late the crew\ncould not turn back and had to steer\nup to the start by pressure. Despite\nthe rush the crew were passed in the\nopposite direction by their race at the\n1500 metre mark and shouted at by another Marshal who took great pleasure\nin informing the crew of their misfor-tune. There was no time to wallow in\nself-pity as three of the crew members\nhad to be back to race in the champ\n8+ (WC8+). The 8+ was now also late\nas a result of having to wait for the\nquad members and after more seat-switching the crew (Hart/Symmonds/\nGraham/Thompson/Philips/Duffy/\nRouse/Bromley) hastily made its way\nto the start line but suffered a shoddy\nperformance as a result. Luckily all losing boats were sent to the repechage\nwhere the crew improved form enough\nto secure a place in the final, but were\nnot strong enough to medal. Stern pair\nLouise Hart and Chloe Symmonds\nwere already exhausted having won the\nopening heat of the intermediate pairs\n(WI2-) and missing out on gold in the\nfinal by 11 seconds.\nThe men\u2019s intermediate quad (MI4x)\nof Tom Bell, John Dick, Matt Lunt and\nAndy Gordon finished third in their\nheat, second in their rep and fourth\nin the final behind winners Reading.\nBoatman Paul put the results of that\nrace into perspective (and actually\nmade the crew feel less disappointed),\n\u201c2 novice scullers and 2 lightweights\nin a scratch crew managing to finish\n4th... I think that\u2019s pretty good\u201d. Dick\nwas appreciative of the comment: \u201cIt\u2019s\nthe nicest thing I\u2019ve ever heard him\nsay.\u201d On Sunday John Dick and Danny\nBellion teamed up for the intermediate\ndoubles (MI2x) and finished second\nin their heat. Due to time restraints\nbetween races Tom Bell took the bow\nseat for the repechage getting them\ninto a final where they finished fifth.\nBell returned crestfallen and drenched\nfrom head to toe. As he dripped his\nway towards the tent there were muffled questions as to whether the crew\nhad capsized during the race. \u201cThey\nmust have, how could he be *that*\nwet?\u201d When John appeared completely\ndry it was clear that Bell\u2019s wetness was\nthe result of a splashing Dick. Again.\nIn the women\u2019s intermediate double\n(WI2x) Chloe Symmonds and Christina Duffy boated with ample time to\nwarm-up and practise some starts. At\nthe 1000 metre mark on the way to\nthe start the collar from Symmonds\u2019\nstroke-side blade came loose and the\nboat had to make it\u2019s way painfully\nback down the return lane to find a\nscrew-driver. With time now slipping\naway the blade was re-geared and the\ncrew set off at full pace to the start line.\nHowever the boat continually veered\ntowards the bank on the way back up\nand by the 1500 metre mark it was\nconcluded that the steering fin was still\nattached to the stern despite removing\nthe foot steering earlier. Coach Ross\nSmitheman had been following on a bicycle and took pity on the traumatised\ncrew. The boat pulled over to the bank\nand Smitheman waded into the lake to\nremove the fin mumbling something\nabout killing Duffy if he got bird shit all\nover him. Sadly the crew were blown\nfrom lane 6 throughout the race and\nfinished fourth missing the repechage\nby less than two seconds.\nOne of the few crews to have trained\ntogether was the men\u2019s intermediate\ncoxed four (MI4+). The four of cox\nLibby Richards, Iain Palmer, Richard\nWinchester, Bruce (Tom) Arnott &\nGareth Brown won both their opening\nheat and semi-final but were pipped to\npole position by Durham in the final\nand had to settle for silver.\nThe disappointment of the weekend\nwent to Georgie Philips who despite\nwinning a silver medal in the women\u2019s\nbeginner single sculls event (ahead of\nIC\u2019s Ella Burroughes who claimed an\nimpressive bronze) was devastated\nat not winning gold. As she made her\nway to the medal ceremony the official\nasked how her race went; a question he\nlater regretted. Philips offered a cynical\nsmile for the photo and headed back to\nthe ICBC tent emotionally distraught.\nComfort was sought from Bruce who\noffered an inspirational speech about\nhow little things can mean a lot to\nsome people and to be grateful of her\nsilver medal. With a glazed eye and\nwistful stare across the lake he shared\nstories of his days down under with\nhis mates and his rubber dinghy. \u201cWe\nloved that dinghy. Because it was our\ndinghy.\u201d Silence befell the mini-bus as\nwe clung to his every word. Philips left\ncomposed, smiling and uplifted. \u201cGood\nonya! She\u2019ll be apples\u201d. As the door shut\nArnott admitted \u201cI\u2019m not happy with\nmy f-cking silver, let\u2019s get real\u2026 this is\nshit, it\u2019s all about the gold.\u201d\nThere were plenty of Dingo\u2019s breakfasts (a yawn, a scratch, a leak and a\ngood look round (i.e. no breakfast)) before weigh-in for the men\u2019s lightweight\n8+ (cox Henry Fieldman/Ole Tietz/\nAdam Freeman-Pask/Andy Gordon/\nMatt Lunt/Oli Mahony/Patrick Hudson/Alex Gillies/John Beaty). Gillies\nseemingly irrepressible energy levels\nwere fuelled in the preceding weeks by\ncups of tea and coffee, marshmallows,\nlollipops, honey sandwiches and cans\nof red bull in order to make weight.\nThe IC crew won their opening heat\nover Durham A and B but were beaten\nto first place by a strong Cambridge\ncrew in the final by a time difference of\nover 10 seconds.\nThe championship men\u2019s lightweight\nquad event (MCLwt4x) saw Adam\nFreeman-Pask, Oli Mahony, Ole Tietz\nand Alex Gillies sail through the opening heat finishing a comfortable sec-ond. The crew made the classic error\nof confusing the women\u2019s Empacher\nquad with the non-existent men\u2019s\nlightweight quad. Bowman Gilles had\nto row feet-out for the race as he could\nnot fit into the steering shoe.\nDespite Steve\u2019s email during the week\nclaiming \u201cit is unlikely to be wet\u201d the\nsunny weather turned to rain on Monday and the wind picked up resulting\nin racing being temporarily postponed.\nAll crews returned to the finish in\ntime to witness four female Durham\nrowers being plucked from the lake\nas their coxless four sank underneath\nthem. With no signs of improvement\nrepechages were cancelled and finals\nwere drawn based on fastest qualifying\ntimes. This left crews who had raced in\nslower heats out for the final, i.e. IC\u2019s\nmen\u2019s intermediate 8+ who dominated\ntheir heat and finished first by rating\n18 for the last 500 metres. Further racing in the beginner sculls was cancelled\nand gold was awarded to IC\u2019s Patrick\nHudson as fastest qualifier. Conditions slightly improved and finals were\nrun in the evening. Erica Thompson\nand Louise Hart claimed silver in the\nwomen\u2019s championship double sculls\n(WC2x) event before jumping into\nthe championship coxed four (WC4+)\n(cox: Richards/Hart/Thompson/Graham/Symmonds) and winning another\nsilver for the club, without Captain\nThompson having to sniper any of the\nDurham crews. Henry Goodier and Simon Hislop won bronze in the men\u2019s\nchampionship double sculls (MC2x),\nand the mens\u2019 lightweight quad now\nracing in the larger BBG for stability\n(and shoes that fit), finished a respectable second.\nWell done to all 52 students who con-tributedtothegreatresultsandshowed\ngood support over the weekend. Training is underway for the women\u2019s squad\nwho will be competing in Ghent this\nweekend as well as a men\u2019s crew who\nwill be racing in the Odra Cup in Poland. Good luck to all involved.\nImperial Boat Club bring home the points after\nwinning 37 medals at BUCS Regatta\nContinued from back page\nEmotional Intelligence\nR\necent research suggests\nthat success in life is not\nnecessarily determined\nby intelligence levels, as\nmeasured by IQ tests, nor\nthe level of education reached. This is\nregardless of whether \u201csuccess\u201d is defined as wellbeing, meaning in life or\nthe accumulation of material posses-sions. Other factors such as Emotional\nIntelligence (EI), personality and the\nability to apply knowledge in a wise\nmanner have been demonstrated to be\nat least as important. In fact one of the\nleading psychologists in the field of EI,\nDan Goldman, has stated that the ability to problem solve using emotions\nmay be the prime driver of success.\nOver the last 15 years UK education\nhas emphasised testing and formulaic teaching of a broad national cur-riculum. During the same period there\nhas been a general improvement in\nthe number of students attaining top\ngrades. There is also some evidence\nthat intelligence, as measured by the\nnarrow definition of IQ, has also in-creased. However a number of reports\nsuggest that many new graduates find\nthe application of their broad knowledge in complex work and social environments challenging. This may be\ndue to the educational emphasis on\nresults rather than the development of\nwisdom but equally it could be due to\nwider social factors such as reduced social interaction among young people.\nLike general intelligence, EI can be\nmeasured using psychometric tools\nand can be developed through coach-ing. EI can be defined as the ability to\nproblem solve using emotions and is\nsubdivided into the ability to recog-nise, understand the complexity of, use\nand manage emotions. Unlike an IQ\nscore, EI has four separate components\nand it is the shape of the profile, rather\nthan the overall score, which is of sig-nificance. For example an individual\nmay have a heightened ability to recognise emotional signals in faces but\na low understanding of how they may\nhave arisen and a low ability to manage\nthe consequences of those emotions\narising. The interplay of those abilities\nshapes thinking styles, actions and attainment of goals. Raising awareness of\nyour unique profile provides a springboard for personal development.\nAndy Roberts explains how being intelligent and having a high\nlevel of education may not necessarily be a recipe for success\nwithout social skills\nTo apply to take the psychomet-ric test and receive a one to one\ncoaching session contact Andy\nRoberts at andy@breathe-london.\ncom or call 07766 34 39 31.

Kay lets begin...\nLast time I was telling you all about\nhow I secured some moolah (long storey short, I cut my hair and got paid\na lump sum). Well what did I do with\nthis newly acquired cash? Spend it of\ncourse. Not as if I\u2019d invest it or something sensible like that. However when\nthe time came to throw the paper into\nthe fire that is shopping, I was troubled\nas where to start. I was all so tempted to\nwhip out my laptop and internet shop\nuntil the early hours of the morning,\nhowever in a more random encoun-ter, I ended up at the new Westfields\nShopping Centre in Shepherds Bush.\nFrom the number 49 bus you can see\nthis mammoth adventure land from\nat least a mile away. From this point it\nlooked absolutely huge, but as the bus\ntraversed along its route, the building\nbecame ever larger, with new annex\u2019s\nof the shopping plaza coming into\nsight the closer in proximity you be-came. As I got off the bus at Shepherds\nBush station, my whole field of vision\nwas encompassed by the shiny exterior\nhousing an unknown number of shops\nwithin its belly.\nAs you walk along the \u201cvalley\u201d that\nleads to the entrance you are surrounded by restaurants diverse in va-riety. Those that stay focused are then\nled into the womb of Westfields, with\nthe first section dubbed \u201cThe Village\u201d\nwhich to me seems ironic as it\u2019s luxurious interior complete with chandeliers is inhabited by the most high end\nshops at hand. Not \u201cVillage\u201d like to me.\nNow I originally thought this place\nlooked big on the outside, but after you\npenetrate the shell you seem to be in a\nspace far larger than you can imagine.\nWith a huge spanning atrium, several\nfloors, spacious and modern design,\nthis centre exudes quality in every di-rection. Its modern large touch screen\npanels supply you with all the information you can handle.\nWell after being lost for several hours\nI finally managed to end up at my starting point. Useful? No. However on\na second run through I hit the shops\nharder than Chuck Norris can hit the\nTitanic. Which he did, I saw it in a\nmovie. I think it was also called Titanic.\nChuck Norris played some kind of Ice\nBerg. Anyway the more time I seemed\nto spend in his place, the more money\nthat was drained from the debit card.\nThought I may add that my wonderful\ngirlfriend picked out all my clothes, so\nthank you honey.

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n16 felix Friday 15 May 2009\nKuniyoshi: the daddy of manga\nThe Royal Academy takes Emilie Beauchamp back through space and time to 19th century Japan\nW\ne often forget the\ninfluence and reali-zations of foreign\ncultures\u2019 masters\nbecause of the\nmassive amount of artists that have\nproliferated right under our noses for\ncenturies in Europe. Fortunately, the\nRoyal Academy of Arts has crossed the\nborders of time and space to present\nus a delightfully unique exhibition\nof one of Japan\u2019s most celebrated art-ists, Utagawa Kuniyoshi. A master of\nwoodblock printing, he was forward-looking and produced extremely imaginative and suggestive compositions,\ninspiring the Japanese masses of the\n19th century. Kuniyoshi was part of\nthe movement known as the \u201cfloating\nworld\u201d arts, which aimed primarily at\ndepicting the new, then peaceful and\nunified Japan and its prosperity. Accordingly, printed scenes focused on\nmyths and legends of warriors glorifying the country, beautiful women and\nlandscapes and other humourous illustrations of \u201cfleeting\u201d pleasures, such as\nkabuki theatre, that the contemporary\nsociety had to offer. Kuniyoshi was\nartistically independent within this\ngroup by developing new printing and\ncomposition techniques. First famous\nfor his depictions of war scenes, he\npresented heroes of the past combating evils, fury and courage all dramatically pictured in their stance and ex-pressions. His fondness for large battle\nscenes lead him to work mostly with\ntriptychs, a three-sheet format of print\nhe developed in response to the limited width of the traditional printing\nblocks. Producing wider landscapes,\nhe innovated by using over the three\nsheets large motives, such as a road\nor a building, so to create a sense of\nperspective and to unify composition.\nBlock printing usually produced two-dimensional depictions, but here again\nKuniyoshi broke the new by inspiring\nhimself from European illustrations\nfound in books to produce new designs\nand styles.\nIn a passion for precision, his pieces\noften included many details such as\ncomplex tattoos on the characters or\nintricate fabric prints and textures.\nThis is astonishing when the amount of\nwork to produce one print is explained:\nKuniyoshi, as the artist, would draw\nor paint the image to be printed, and\nwould then work with a team of woodblock carvers to ensure all elements\nof the drawing would be perfectly\npressed on paper. Private publishers\nwould then sponsor the printing to up\nto 8000 copies of a composition, to be\nsold in the streets. As Kuniyoshi was\na proliferate artist, this process could\nbe repeated many times in a week to\ncreate as much as 4 different compositions per week. It is good to remember\nthat block prints were a communal\nform of art, produced for the masses\nand costing less than a double portion\nof noodles in the street. Consequently,\nthe prints were the main significant\nmedium of mass communication, aiming to amuse or inspire the widely literate public but also becoming a form of\nsubtle social critics of the government\nin later days.\nIn fact, in 1842 the government introduced new publishing regulations\nwhich included bans on images of\ncourtesans and geishas, or any depiction that could somehow represent a\nperverted side of Japan\u2019s slowly emancipating society. Consequently, pictures of beautiful women that had been\na very lucrative genre disappeared for\na few years. They were replaced by\ntraditional scenes from everyday life,\nsuch as women at work or enjoying\nseasonal amusements of countryside\nJapan or even by a series of compositions on historical heroic women. At\nthis point, Kuniyoshi started to widen\nhis field of inspiration, producing more\nlandscapes, but also humourous pieces\nsuch as pamphlets on kabuki and arts\ncamouflaging criticism of the censure\nimposed on his art and other government policies. His satiric pieces even\ninclude a series of grotesque erotic\nprints in which sexual organs are taking the lead, called \u201cNight Procession\nof the Hundred Demons\u201d. His pieces\nalways displaying bright colours and\nimpeccable lines add up to make this\nexhibition historically and artistically\ncaptivating, exploring Japan through\nthe ancestor of today\u2019s mangas and\ncartoon animations. In short, anyone\nwho can afford the entry fee should\nplunge to discover this exhibition with\ndelight. Note that arriving early will allow you to avoid the mass of lazy tourists coming from noon onwards and to\ncomfortably wander around.\nUntil 7th June\nSubwarden\nVacancies\nApplications are invited for the position of\nsubwarden at the new Eastside.

    "content": "business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 felix Friday 15 May 2009\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Luke Dhanoa\nEvil speculators conspire against\nhonest automotive workers\nContributing writer Sina Ataherian takes a look at the fate of the American car industry giant Chrysler.\nLuke Dhanoa\nBusiness Editor\nW\nhen we become\npoorer, or feel like\nwe are about to, one\nof the last things we\nwish to buy is a car.\nSo for American car companies, crippled by debt even before the current\ndownturn, to be finding times hard is\nno surprise. Chrysler has entered bank-ruptcy, and will re-emerge under Fiat.\nGM is now attempting to get agreement on voluntary restructuring, and\nif this fails may soon follow Chrysler\ninto bankruptcy. Their combined loss\nlast year was $48 billion, with American car sales down from their annual\npeak at 17 million to just 9 million this\nyear.\nThe United States government has\nannounced a \u201cdeal\u201d to rescue Chrysler. Secured creditors have been offered 28% of the $7 billion that they are\nowed. This is despite the auto workers\u2019\nhealthcare fund being offered 43% of\nits $11 billion, even though its claims\nshould legally come second to those of\nthe secured creditors. If GM follows\nChrysler into chapter 11, its creditors\u2019\nfortunes look no better. They have\nbeen offered 5% of their $27 billion,\nwhilst the health-care trust will get\n50% as well as significant shares in the\nrestructured company.\nWhen unions agree to future promises made by their firm, they are speculating that it will continue to exist. This\nis no different from creditors agreeing\nto promises that their debt will be re-paid. Creditors who wish to reduce\ntheir risk of counterparty default can\nmake sure they get first dibs on the assets of a bankrupt firm. They do this\nby accepting the lower interest paid\nto \u2018secured creditors\u2019. The US government now appears to be ignoring this\nprinciple.\nIn setting this precedent, its biggest\nvictims may be those it has the greatest\nresponsibility to protect: those whose\nsurvival is seen as, and therefore probably is, the most important to the gov-ernment. This is especially true at a\ntime when it wants the private sector\nto invest $1 trillion in its Term Asset\nBacked Securities Loan Facility. This\nis needed if lending to consumers and\nsmall business is to restart. Furthermore, the vilified creditors include\npension funds and individuals, many of\nwhom are themselves members of the\nUnited Auto Workers Union (UAW),\nwho also happened to be Chrysler\ncreditors.\nHowever, there is a plausible defence\nfor the deal: that the creditors are being offered a fair price. Perhaps 28\ncents per dollar of secured borrowing\nis all that would come out of liquidating Chrysler. This theory continues\nthat hedge funds know how hard the\nUS government will try to save Chrysler, and presumably also GM when the\ntime comes. They will even be willing to grossly over-value the UAW\u2019s\nclaims to avoid strike action, even if\nthis makes whatever the creditors get\nappear too little by comparison.\nBut the funds can also see how much\nthe government will try to avoid loss\nof creditor confidence of exactly the\nsort likely here. So they are holding out\nfor more than their fair share. By this\naccount, they are using the same tactics of economic terrorism that other\nfinancial institutions used to secure\ntheir multi-billion-dollar bail-outs.\nThis theory sounds somewhat paranoid and created after then fact. But\nthe incentive would certainly exist and\nit is difficult to dismiss without the\nsort of consideration that it should be\nafforded during bankruptcy proceed-ings. This leads to the next problem.\nThe Chrysler bankruptcy judge has\nagreed to a speedy process, giving little chance for creditors to advocate\nliquidation of the company\u2019s assets. So\nthe problem is not that Chrysler and\nthe US government have identified\nthe problems of liquidation, including\nfor the creditors. The issue is that they\nconvinced the judge that liquidation\nwould be so much worse than the existing deal, even for the creditors, that\nit cannot even be considered.\nThere is yet another political dimension to this; not only do many lenders\nnow feel ripped off, they are simultaneously being blamed for the problems\nof the auto industry. This sort of de-monising, especially given how much\nof it is currently going on anyway, has\nthe potential to multiply the damage\nthat the whole affair does to creditors\u2019\nconfidence.\nMany people will find it difficult to\nsympathise with the hedge funds, having trouble with their cut-throat practice and wealth. But it is not the point.\nWhen a market is distorted there are\ntwo losers.\nCreditors will lose out from increased perception of risk. But so will\nthe consumers and businesses that are\nnow so in need of their credit.\nBusiness news quarterly digest\nIt\u2019s about a month late, but since we\u2019ve\nbeen away for the duration of the holi-days, the business section has put together a quarterly digest to cover all\nthe major economic bases from the\nlast three months. If you\u2019re heading to\na job interview, it\u2019s just what the doctor\nordered.\nNew Bail Outs\nThe bank of England has declared\nthat it will keep interest rates at 0.5%\nand will be printing \u00a350bn to inject\ninto the banking system. At the mo-ment, the Bank of England is set to inject a total of \u00a3125bn into the financial\nsystem by June (including the new in-crease). The bulk of this new injection\nwill be delivered to banks by buying up\ncorporate and government bonds. Currently Her Majesties Treasury owns\n70.33% of the Royal Bank of Scotland\nand 43% of Lloyds Banking Group plc,\nwhich in turn wholly owns HBOS. This\nnew bailout plan was triggered when\nnews surfaced that the toxic assets held\nby HBOS were significantly larger than\npreviously thought. The Governor of\nthe Bank of England, Mervyn King said\nthat the central bank may need up to\n\u00a3150bn over the course of its \u201cquantitative easing\u201d programme, and stated\nthat he believed the economy a long\nway from recovered. The city generally\napplauded the move, with several chief\neconomists stating their approval of\nthe BOE\u2019s \u201crealistic\u201d approach to dealing with the crisis.\nGreen Shoots and Red Herrings\nNationwide Building Society claims\nthat last month UK consumer confidence has experienced its biggest\nincrease in two years with the service sector shrinking by its smallest\namount since August 2008. The 12\nmonth change in Consumer Price Index for the first quarter fell to 3.0%\ncompared with 3.9% in the last quarter of 2008 and over the same period\nthe Retail Price index fell from 2.7% to\n-0.1%. RPI excluding housing also fell\nfrom 4.2% to 3.3% indicating a medium\nterm decrease in inflation of consumable goods. It is clear that the housing\nprice drop and low interest rates have\nled to deflation in the RPI and is the\nmain cause of deflationary pressure.\nThe UK\u2019s trade deficit also decreased\nfrom \u00a32.8bn in February to \u00a32.5bn in\nMarch \u2013 much better than predicted.\nConsidering the decreases in domestic manufacturing, the narrowing has\nbeen assumed to be to product of the\nweaker pound - which has remained\nunder $1.6 for all of 2009 \u2013 and reduced demand for foreign goods in the\nrecessional market.\nThe FTSE 100 has risen for the last\nthree months from 3500 at the start of\nMarch to almost 4500 last week. This\nrise has been echoed by the Dow Jones\n(which rose from just under 7000 to\nroughly 8500 over the same period) the\nGerman Dax (3600 to 4800), the Mumbai Stock Exchange (8000 to 12000) and\nthe Nikkei 225 (7000 to 9200). Few serious forecasters have taken this to mean\nthat the recession has shown signs of\nreversing, identifying the gains as a\n\u201csuckers rally\u201d. During the 2000-2002\nbear market there were three similar\nrises averaging 21% over 45 days and\nthe Great Depression experienced six\nrises, averaging 47% each.\nSome analysts (such as Peter Schiff\nthe head of Euro Pacific Capital, Inc)\nbelieve that the root cause of the stock\nmarket booms is the volatility in the\nvalue of currencies. Indeed, with commodity prices also increasing over the\nlast quarter and the average value of\nUS Dollars, Euros and Pounds losing\nground to less recession sensitive currencies (like the New Zealand Dollar),\nit would seem credible that people are\nbuying into stocks because they are\nperceived to be less volatile that currencies \u2013 especially when central banks\nare prone to printing money. Given the\ntailing off of stock price gains over the\nlast week, it would seem that this trend\nmay be about to reverse.\nNew Budget\nAfter a delay, the Government unveiled its new budget last month which\nincluded a 50% tax rate on people who\nearn over \u00a3150,000, up from 45% last\nyear. Fuel duty will increase by 2p per\nlitre and alcohol duty will increase by\n2% (about a penny on a pint) and cigarettes will see a 7p increase. Overall\nmeasures will raise tax income by \u00a36bn\nby 2012, however by 2013 total government spending is expected to exceed\ntaxation by 79% of GDP, a statistic that\nwas widely hailed as disastrous by opposition Parties. The budget was also\nunderpinned on extremely optimistic economic forecasts that predicted\ngrowth of 1.25% in 2010 and 3.5% in\n2011. Most forecasts estimate 2010\u2019s\ngrowth to be closer to 0.9%. The government also expected decreases in\nCPI and PRI over the course of the\nyear as a result of lower food and energy prices \u2013 a prediction that remains\nwidely uncontested.\nOverall the budget was poorly received by the markets, which fell, the\npublic who pushed Labour behind in\nthe polls and political parties with Nick\nClegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats\nsaying that Labour \u201chave condemned\nus to years of unemployment and decades of debt\u201d.\nimperialcollegeunion.org/ball\nSummer Ball 2009\nImperial College London\nSaturday 20 June\nCABARET STAGE\n(THE DOCTOR & THE PENCIL)\nTHE GLOBE GIRLS JAZZ BIG BAND\nNOEL FIELDING & DAVE BROWN\n\u00a335\nfrom\n15 May\n\u00a340\nENTERTAINMENTS\n\u00a370\nfrom\n15 May\n\u00a375\nDINNER\nLIVE ARENA\nATHLETE\nROSIE & THE GOLDBUG TAPE THE RADIO\nBATTLE OF THE BANDS WINNER\nJEFF AUTOMATIC CLUB NME\nALSO...\nDANCE VENUE\nPENDULUM\nCHASE & STATUS FEAT MC RAGE\n(EL HORNET DJ SET) FEAT MC JAKES\nINTERLOPE (LIVE)\nKILLA KELA SCRATCH PERVERTS\n\u2022 FUN FAIR\n\u2022 BIG WHEEL\n\u2022 DODGEMS\n\u2022 AMAZING LIGHT SHOWS\n\u2022 3D PROJECTIONS\n\u2022 FOOD VANS\n\u2022 WANDERING ACTS\n\u2022 FIREWORKS\n\u2022 SURVIVORS\u2019 PHOTO\n\u2022 TONI & GUY HAIR SALON\n\u2022 PROFESSIONAL\nPHOTOGRAPHER\nCABARET STAGE\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF\nFE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nEA\nA\nA\nA\nAT\nT\nT\nT\nF\nF\nF\nFE\nE\nE\nEA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nAT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nLAST CHANCE TO GET\nEARLY-BIRD PRICES\nPRICES\nRISE\nFRIDAY15\n@5PM\n\n"

Teams just\ndidn\u2019t want to play us. That said, we\nknew that Sunday would prove more\ndifficult as we faced a Brunel 1st XI still\nundefeated in BUCS competition.\nWe fielded a strong XI and opted to\nbat first in glorious sunshine on a flat\nwicket. We\u2019d flown Srisai in a week before as our overseas player and confidence was high when he thumped first\nbowl of the innings over mid-on\u2019s head\nfor four. However, when he tried to repeat the shot later in the over things\ndidn\u2019t quite go so well, and he spurned\na catch to mid-on this time. Luckily\nmid-on was polite enough to drop it.\nNot quite so lucky was Matt Tarr who\nfound himself victim to a straight pull\nfrom Srisai the next over. He moved\nright, then left before deciding to stop\nthe ball with his tummy. \u201cGood job\nhe\u2019s a fat *******\u201d was the shout. I won\u2019t\nname the player who shouted this, but\nneedless to say \u201che ain\u2019t too trim himself\u201d. Matt, clearly riled by banter from\nhis own team, went next over as one\nlooped up off the shoulder of his bat.\nSrisai was joined by Majid at the\ncrease and both were in full flow. Unfortunately, for every boundary they\nscored, they shared a chance with the\nfielding side and it wasn\u2019t long before\nboth had thrown their wickets away for\nidentical scores of 27 runs.\nI then found myself at the crease\nwith Ali Najefi, both of us prematurely\ndisturbed from much needed revision.\nWe battled through the next few overs\nagainst two good spells of bowling before Ali feathered one behind when\non 13. As you might expect I played a\nsparkling innings and it wasn\u2019t until I\ngot a leading edge on 44 that I had to\nreturn to the pavilion. Unfortunately, a\nfew other wickets had tumbled by then\nfor not many runs and it was thanks to\nsome good batting at the tail that we\nmanaged to string together a defend-able total of 172 all out.\nTea followed and after the interval\nwe started brightest. Zirgham Afridi\nworked hard for two early wickets, but\nBrunel made steady progress in reply.\nAhsaan Ismail bowled some jaffers at\nthe other end, too good for players at\nour level yet not good enough for the\nwicket. Brunel\u2019s next partnership was a\nlong one (and boring). They trimmed\nto deficit to 70 before Rajiv \u201cJeeves\u201d\nShah got the breakthrough, caught and\nbowled. After arranging and rearranging his hair with the aid of an Alice\nband he even got another wicket a few\novers later.\nDaniel Johnpillai was on at the other\nend and zipping through his overs. He\nalways looked good for a wicket and\nAre you spending this Summer in London?\nStay in halls and save a packet!\nRooms are going fast so book today!\nWhy not stay in Halls before\nmoving into private\naccommodation next term?\nGreat rates for stays of\n8 weeks or more\nWilson House in Paddington and Pembridge Hall in Notting Hill are both available\nfor Imperial Students to stay in this summer whether you\u2019re spending the entire\nsummer vacation period in London or if you\u2019re just visiting for a few days.\nStaying in Halls is the perfect stop gap if you\u2019re between private accommodation\ncontracts and can help if you want to save a bit of money.\nWe\u2019ve got 3 price bands available which are charged depending on how long you\nwant to stay for:\nl Short stays - less than 4 weeks\nl Standard stays - 4-8 weeks\nl Long stays - 8 weeks +\nTo \ufb01nd out more and to apply visit www.imperial.ac.uk/accommodation\nBrunel cricketers deal blow\nto BUCS promotion bid\nRugby\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI 173\nBrunel Men\u2019s 1st XI 177\nShiraz Sabah\nhe got it next over when I took THE\nbest catch you\u2019ve ever seen.

Jeeves\ncontinued at the other end and took a\nwicket next over as the batsman skied\none to Zirgham at mid-on for a catch I\nhad money on him dropping. Did I say\nI was always right? Unfortunately the\nnew batter was a full-on slogger. Ugly\nas you like but effective.

Please?\n\u201cAre you that\nruthless you\ndon\u2019t mind\nletting someone\nelse lose a part\nof their degree\nthat you\u2019re\nstriving to?\u201d\nI\nhave had a truly dire week. A collection of events has turned my\ngeneral indifference on life into\ndespair. I\u2019m pretty much ready\nto murder a small animal, cook\nit, and force-feed it to a child. There\u2019s\nsome fellow shaking his leg in front of\nme as I sit in the library, and the only\nthing holding me back from going over\nand jabbing my compass into his legs\nis the fact I don\u2019t have a compass. Stop\nshaking your leg, you prick.\nSo where do I start? I mean, who do\nI point the finger at first? O2, normally\na reliable broadband provider, decide\nit\u2019d be hilarious if they trickled a minimal internet connection to my house.\nI can\u2019t check Facebook for two whole\nhours, and my social life is reduced to\neating cold spaghetti hoops in my bath\ntub every night for the next week. Not\nso bad you might say. I hear you loud\nand clear: a cold bathtub, bits of processed pasta and a tomato sauce undoubtedly full of preservatives are actually the three things Barack Obama\ncannot live without. And look where\nhe is now.\nThen my laptop died on its feet (it\ndoesn\u2019t have feet). In a mid-contract\ncrisis, broadband had nervous breakdown and moved out. Apparently. My\nlaptop decided it couldn\u2019t live without\nbroadband. Without it, it is useless in\nits only function as a means of streaming terabytes of porn, and some occasional coursework submissions. So it\ngave up and died, only for broadband\nto return the next day a little apologetic\nand remarkably healthier than ever. It\nwas like a poor version of that Romeo\nand Juliet scene, but after this scene,\nI was left bricking it as I remembered\neach file and folder I\u2019d lost.\nWithoutmylaptopforentertainment,\nI decided to break the Imperial mould,\nand socialise; by visiting some friends.\nFuck that, I lie. I went over to steal\nsome coursework off them I hadn\u2019t really bothered to do prior to this whole\nepisode. Instead of a lovely evening of\nbanter and all around nothing, I spend\nthe night listening to their neighbours\nand end up being banned from making any sort of noise (apparently to enhance the listening-to-neighbours ex-perience). All we can hear through the\nwall is screaming, slamming of doors,\nfurniture being thrown, and two dogs\ngoing absolutely mental. So with the\naching fear that some sort of massacre\nwas going on metres away from me,\nadded to the possibility we might be\nnext for a butchering, we called the po-lice. Twice. I\u2019ve never called 999 (never\nmind twice), but I\u2019m hoping I made a\ndifference or saved someone from any\nsort of harm when I did. I never found\nout what was actually going on next\ndoor.\nNow, here is where things really start\ngoing wrong. 12th of May, and it is a\nMonday evening. I\u2019m happily (not\nso happily) doing some work in G27\nComputer Lab in the Sir Alexander\nFleming Building, otherwise affectionately known as the SAF. Someone\nreally important to me comes in, and\nI need to leave the room to turn an otherwise failing week into an acceptable\none. In the time I\u2019m absent from the\nroom, someone comes into the room,\ngoes through my bag I left by my com-puter, and steals my Ipod and two USB\nsticks.\nWhen my laptop died holding my entire music library, personal photos, all\nmy coursework from the last two years\nof university, and every single article\nI\u2019ve ever written for Felix on it, I wasn\u2019t\ntoo bothered. Mainly because the fact\nFacebook holds nearly all the photos I\u2019d\nlost. But also the fact that I had all my\nmusic on my Ipod anyway. And also\nthe fact I had all my coursework and\nFelix articles on those two USB sticks.\nNow do you get where I\u2019m coming\nfrom when I feel like I want to murder\nthose small animals, cook it, force-feed\nit to a child, then break down in tears\nremembering the loss of nearly all the\nthings that have been necessitating my\nlife to run within normality for the past\ntwo years?\nWhat kind of person comes into the\ncomputer rooms at ten in the evening,\nand pilfers other people\u2019s bags. I\u2019d expect that to happen back home in Watford, my shithole of a hometown. Not\nat university, especially a university\nwhere everyone should have their head\nscrewed on all the way.\nI acknowledge the fact I\u2019m majorly\nto blame here. I shouldn\u2019t have left\nmy Ipod in my bag whilst I left the\nroom, but for the reasons I needed\nto leave the room, I would have left a\nlot more there. Beyond that, I doubt\nanyone would expect something like\nthis to happen in College, where everyone leaves their possessions around\ncarelessly.\nSo here\u2019s a message to whoever the\nprotagonist in this life-reducingly disgraceful behaviour is. I hope you\u2019re\nreading.\nI can understand why you\u2019d take my\nIpod. It\u2019s probably not worth much, it\nwas a 4th generation Ipod and looked\nlike it\u2019d survived a go in a blender, but\nI can still understand why you took it.\nBut why take my USB memory stage\nsticks? They were both free, and probably worth absolutely nothing to you;\nbut the contents on the sticks were so\nvaluable to me. Isn\u2019t it clear that as a\nstudent, I\u2019d have important coursework or dissertations on it? Are you\nthat ruthless you don\u2019t mind letting\nsomeone else lose a part of their degree\nthat you\u2019re similarly striving to gain?\nWell, I hope you\u2019re happy whoever\nyou are. The joke is on you though. As\nshit as I feel being forced to be in the\nlibrary into the small hours of the night\ndoing work now, how shit are you going to feel when they identify you on\nthat night\u2019s CCTV footage. Both Imperial College Security Services and the\nMetropolitan Police are now involved,\njust to let you know.\nSo, how\u2019s this for a deal: you anonymously hand-in the Ipod and most\nimportantly the USB memory sticks to\nthe SAF reception, no questions asked,\nand I won\u2019t pursue the theft. The SAF\nreception will not be notified about\nany sort of hand-in (and I doubt they\nread felix), it will look like any other\nlost property hand-in, and I get my\nsome of my life back. Please.\nT\nell me Annabel, while\nyou were masturbating with self-satisfaction\nover your poignant/tear-jerking rebuttal of the\noriginal speculation, did it not occur\nto you that a response worth publishing should have included a point? By\nwhich I mean among all the meaningless deconstruction, unfunny reaction\nand unintentional irony, perhaps, just\nfor giggles and shits, there could have\nbeen a purpose for wasting the readers time? I searched the entirety of last\nweek\u2019s 700+ word drivel, admittedly\nfalling into a mild coma halfway after\nOD\u2019ing on tedium, but was unable to\nfind a crux, conclusion or anything\neven placidly amusing (aside from the\nchronology of quotations taken from\nmy article, each followed by inconse-quential, unintelligent comments that\nconfirm a fundamental misunderstanding of satirical prose).\nIndeed, given the extent to which\nAnnabel Slater analysed my words on\nsuch a serious level, the only plausible\ndeduction is that she has acute emotional retardation or a face that suggests her mother had a loud bark, or\nboth. Remember, one has to face the\nproblem even if the problem is one\u2019s\nface. Imperial College\u2019s men are so\nacademically successful because girls\nlike her give us another reason to stay\nin and study every night.\nFor anyone else distressed by my\nwriting; I recommend Johnson\u2019s \u2018No\nmore Tears\u2019 Baby Shampoo. This will\nguarantee and end to whiny monologues about Felix writers insulting\npeople. If you still feel victimised, there\nis a terrific webpage on the Connexions site entitled \u2018Dealing with Bullies\u2019.\nIf you want to beat the bullies some of\nthe best things for you to try are:\n\u2022 Tell someone you trust - what about\na teacher, parent, carer or friend? Did\nyou tell your carer someone was writing in the Felix being mean about\npeople? When you talk to someone\nabout your problems, they halve!\nSharing is caring!\n\u2022 Try to ignore the person bullying\nyou. This is an excellent time for you\nto become a missing person.\n\u2022 Try and stay in a group and avoid\ngoing places by yourself, that way you\nare not such an easy target. Those Felixes won\u2019t dare try anything when\nyour internet \u2018penpals\u2019 have your\nback!\n\u2022Make sure that your body language\nis confident and stand tall. You probably already have a shallow sense of\nself-confidence now that geographical convenience has forced others to\nbe your friends. If you decided that\nuniversity would be a \u2018fresh start\u2019\n,\nyou are probably a loser.\n\u2022 Keep a diary of what happens, who\nwas involved, when it was and what\nthey did.\nThis one is a pisstake. Here is what\nyour diary might look like.\nDear DiaryWhat happened: I read a satirical\narticle in the newspaper and almost\nhad my menopause, that\u2019s how much\nit upset me! I felt inclined to write a\nresponse defending all those with XX\nchromosomes by pointlessly decon-structing every sentence he wrote.\nWho was involved: Some guy called\nthe\u2018Rogue\u2019(whatkindofjeb-endnames\nthemselves after the \u2018Satirical Rogue\u2019\nfrom Hamlet - remaining anonymous\nin order to freely express his views\u2026\noh yes somebody who understands the\nvalue of satire in commentary).\nWhen it was: The incident occurred\nmid-march. It took a lot of awkward,\npasty sex before I had the courage\nto write a bunch of dry, worthless\nremarks.\nWhat they did: The Rogue used language that suggests he was trying to\nmake people laugh, through parody\nand blanket statements, exaggeration\nand lampoon. I knew the only funny\nthing that could ever come out of my\nmouth is his cock, so I went for the\n\u2018systematic\u2019, \u2018bitter\u2019, and \u2018systematically\nbitter\u2019 angle and patted myself on the\nback.\nI can imagine Annabel and her kind\nquivering with anticipation to label me\nan odious, misogynistic freak. Once\nagain, despite hints among the parody,\nthe point has been missed. For her\nbenefit, and anyone else who is still\ncrying into their pillow /doing extra\nsets in the gym/ menstruating early as\na result of reading my words - my attempt to explain \u2018satire\u2019 may put it all\nin context;\nClip and Carry; The Rogue\u2019s quick\nGuide to Satire\nA literary manner which blends a\ncritical attitude with humour. This is a\ntypical and reasonable definition of the\nstyle of writing that has existed since\nthe 2nd Millennium BC - as a tool\nwhere wit is employed to criticize. The\nbest definitions of satire should be formulated from a combination of its corrective intent and its literary method of\nexecution \u2013 exaggeration and sarcasm\nare some of the tools exploited by the\nwriter. The true satirist is conscious of\nthe frailty of institutions of man\u2019s devising and attempts through laughter\nto inspire a change of scenery. In other\nwords, all phrases, hyperbole and implications are not intended to offend\nbut rather to amuse, while subtly suggesting an adjustment on whatever the\nobject of disapproval may be. Satire\nneed have no moral lesson or didactic\npurpose, yet the essence of satire is aggression or criticism through ridicule,\nand criticism (as opposed to existen-tialistic nihilism) has always implied a\nmeasure of good and bad.\nWoo woo! Here comes the clue train,\nlast stop is you. By analysing every satirical exaggeration I made Annabel\nhas achieved little except reveal her\nlack of humour. By the way, it isn\u2019t particularly challenging to make phrases\nsound inane by placing them out of\ncontext. For example, and I hate to\nquote quotes, the most idiotic section\nof the response (and there were a lot\nto choose from) was the implication\nthat I have pigeon-holed every girl at\nImperial into either one that \u2018walks\npast you\u2019 or \u2018looks at you and walks\npast you\u2019. Very shrewd, except that\nclearly wasn\u2019t what I was contending,\nit was just an observation of attitudes\n(and the fact she describes people one\npasses on the walkway as \u2018strangers\u2019\nrather than \u2018fellow university goers\u2019 insinuates her frightening lack of social\nskills. Was she recently raped, or does\nshe prefer to meet people on World of\nWarcraft?). And even more aggravating\nis Annabel\u2019s uproarious comment slyly\npoking fun at the fact I use \u2018big words\u2019.\nThe irony is her article was bursting\nwith grammatical faults and attempts\nto use clever language that consistently\nfall short. Don\u2019t believe me? Re-read\nthe FIRST sentence; \u2018Imperial full of\nplain Janes with delusional perceptions\nof self-worth, shallow brains.\u2019 An opening sentence with no verb \u2013 it\u2019s tragic,\nlike tripping over the first hurdle at the\nParalympics.\nIf her words were people, I would\nembrace their genocide. Indeed, if her\nwords were people, she still wouldn\u2019t\nhave any friends. And to anyone else\nwho still doesn\u2019t get it; it\u2019s high time\nyou piped down.\nPS. Annabel was desperate to know if\nI had female friends. I\u2019ll have you know\nI have over 37 Facebook \u2018friends\u2019, some\nof whom claim to be female. Suck it.\nThe Rogue gives his reply to Annabel Slater\n\u201cIf her words\nwere people, I\nwould embrace\ngenocide [and]\nshe still wouldn\u2019t\nhave any\nfriends\u201d\nW\nhen Professor Gershon Carbuncle,\nD.D. and the Reverend Willoughby\nTrisket, two of the\nnation\u2019s most respected theologians,\nmeet to engage in the sort of feast of\nreason and flow of soul that characterises men of a high and noble calling,\nthere is bound to be a certain coldness\nin the air. After all, have not Prof. Carbuncle\u2019s papers on Anatolian monophysitism directly undermined the\nRev. Trisket\u2019s attempts to revive an interest in Nestorian Christology? Could\nthe Reverend\u2019s last sermon to the annual convocation of East Anglian vicars be seen in any other light than as\na direct attack on the interpretation of\nPsalm 137 so vehemently advocated by\nProfessor Carbuncle?\nThe meal begins in silence, with only\nthe occasional half-hearted pleasantry\nto interrupt the distinctive sound of\ntwo mustachioed men angrily imbibing soup. A snide dig at the ethics of\nthe first Nicean council made over the\nroast beef and potatoes leads to an\nincendiary remark on the sexual predilections of those in holy orders, and\nbefore long the language has descended to a level unbecoming of two men of\nsuch theological distinction. It is at this\npoint in the proceedings that the Rev.\nTrisket pours his glass of claret onto\nhis adversary\u2019s lap, and Prof. Carbuncle knocks off the reverend\u2019s glasses\nwith an expertly-pitched bread roll.\nAfter a brief metaphysical alterca-tion, and just as he is about to pin the\nReverend\u2019s ear to the floor with a fish\nknife, the Professor graciously concedes on an issue concerning Genesis\n1:3. The Reverend, with his free hand\nclosing around a stainless silver candle-stick, is forced to regretfully mumble\nassent. As the battered duo sheepishly\nhelp each other to their feet, they settle\nthe bill and part ways with a newfound\nmeekness, the Reverend solemnly raising an indented bowler as the Professor\nwaves with his remaining good hand.\nTheir sudden rapprochement on the\nissue of Creation is echoed regularly\nthroughout the land, with scholars\nconcluding in virtual unanimity that\nin creating the Universe the Almighty\nwas absolutely onto a Good Thing. In\nparticular, peer-review committees\nhave long applauded the decision to\ntake a day off after six days of what\nwas, it must be admitted, pretty intensive construction work. It had, of\ncourse, previously occurred to other\ngods to create their own days - with\nsome even possessing the narcissism to\nname them after themselves - but none\nhad taken the action to such inspired\nheights. Odin must have felt pretty\nsilly, at that point, to have laid claim\nto a piece of the weekly real estate of\nno possible use to anyone. Frigga was\ndoubtless perfectly livid to have her\nnamesake reduced to a mere harbinger of the weekend; in the same way\nas minor celebrities who are the talk of\nthe town when they move in to no. 24\nAdenough Avenue have an unbounded\nresentment for the A-list couple who\nmove in at no. 26.\nIt is precisely this sort of forward\nthinking and profound understanding of the needs of the marketplace\nthat have assured our Lord the enduring fanbase he enjoys today. In a\nrecent poll conducted by The Lonely\nShepherd newsletter, as a part of their\nthree-week \u2018The Almighty - A Top Ten\u2019\nseries, the weekend was found to be\nthe undisputed favourite of the Lord\u2019s\nachievements; followed by his work on\nthe Resurrection and that frightfully\nclever solo business with the Red Sea.\nIt fills one with a sense of inestimable gratitude to the Powers That Be to\njolt out of bed at 07:00 on a Saturday\nmorning and to have the delicious realization slowly flood over one that\none\u2019s bed is a safe haven for at least a\nfew hours more. The Saturday lie-in\nmust rank among the most glorious of\nhuman discoveries. I can imagine that\nChadwick and Walton may have approached such divine heights of ecstasy\non the Thursday they finally managed\nto split the atom, but it is more likely\nthat even this must have paled in comparison to their reactions when sleeping in on the following Saturday.\nThe sudden shock of discovering\nthat it is Saturday morning is enough\nto startle ruthless dictators out of their\nblood frenzy, encourage pillagers to\nhold off their pillaging until further\nnotice, and cause the most sordid and\ninhuman of murderers to roll over and\ndrowsily mumble their way back to\nsleep. Upset consciences and tortured\nsouls achieve a moment of quiet in the\nearly hours of the weekend, when the\nsum of their troubles involves finding\nthe snooze button on the alarm.\nUnless I am mistaken you too, gentle\nreader, are about to go into a weekend\n- if not tomorrow then soon, very soon.\nWhat fun for you! Have you planned\nhow you are going to spend it? I\u2019m sure\nyou have - scheduled it in merciless\ndetail, no doubt. I have always envied\nyou that singular determination and\ndrive you display, dear reader, when\nit comes to revision time. Not for you\nthe endless procrastinatory pacing, accompanied by a sudden desire to wash\ndishes or scrub floors. You can revel in\nthe weekend as the first-class coach of\na weekly train, and not merely treat it\nas a buffer between adjacent carriages.\nYour exams, I am sure, will pass you\nby as the idle wind which you respect\nnot, but weekends will remain as a lasting hebdomedary monument to one of\nthe Lord\u2019s more insightful moments.\nEnjoy them while you can - you never\nknow how long it\u2019ll be till they next\ncome around.\nGilead Amit waxes lyrical over the weekend\nIssue 12 \u2022 Summer 2009 - OUT NOW!\nScratch & Sniff front cover!!!\nFocus: green\nenergy\nALSO: Proust Phenomenon, Solar\nCars & London\u2019s Wild Parrots\nI, science\nOUT MONDAY\nin the library\n\n"

In my opinion the best thing about this festival is the sole fact that my\nexams finish on the 11th\n. Now exams are the worst thing all year, so what is better\nthan a music festival to pick you up straight after?\nNow I know Download Festival is a heavy metal festival, but believe it or not,\nI like the music, and so do many other people. With a massive line up this year\n(unlike last years poor attempt) fans form all over the country , and I\u2019m sure the\nworld, will assemble en mass to smoke, drink and get fucking messy!\nThe first thing I want to talk about is how much I\u2019m looking forward to seeing\nsome of the bands on show. In what may be a surprise, the band I\u2019m most excited\nabout are \u201cThe Prodigy\u201d. Now I know they don\u2019t really fit into the whole Metal\ngenre, but the gigs these guys put on are fucking brutal. Taking a 10Kg mace to\nthe next year\u2019s editor\u2019s, Dan Wan\u2019s, face would be a beautiful cherry blossom in\ncomparison. Also there are solid favourites such as the ureal Slipknot. Who else\nwill be a \u201cmust see\u201d during my time there? Well there will be Clutch (Think of\ncowboy metal), the sick and twisted Marilyn Manson, the hard hitting Opeth and\nthe classic one hit wonder, Journey. I also want to make an effort to see the other\ngreat bands (and there are so many). In particular Faith No More, Korn, Staind,\nDragonforce and Dream Theatre.\nThe next thing on my agenda is the whole camping element associated with\nmusic festivals. Now I\u2019m going to have to trawl the inter webs to find a nice, but\nextremely cheap tent, to live in for three days, until the end of the festival comes,\ncausing everyone to become crazed animals. The burning of tents is an almost\nsacred ritual which seems to happen every time. I feel there is no escape, so the\ncheaper the tent the better. Also I will need to stock up on some serious booze. I\nthink 10 cases of beer for three days is a minimum. Not just beer though, a complete stocking of all things recreation need to be done, It\u2019s just beer is the most\nimportant.\nThe last thing that I have to think about is travel. Seriously, this place is in don-nington, and I don\u2019t have a car available to drive this year. Lets hope the shuttle\nbusses form the train station are still running by time we get there. All in all Download is something I am very happy about attending. YAY!\nI am extremely excited about my first time at Download festival. With hundreds of\nbands playing and SO MUCH beer to drink it will be impossible to see it all! Friday\nstarts off with a massive throwback to the early 90\u2019s with not one but TWO of numetal\u2019s biggest bands: KoRn and the newly-reformed Limp Bizkit! Sure, neither\nband has pulled out a good album for 10 years, but the 14-year old inside of me\ncannot freakin wait to headbang to such kickass tracks as \u201cBlind\u201d or \u201cRollin\u201d!\nOn a more serious note, metalcore gods Killswitch Engage will be previewing\nsongs from their forthcoming album which is bound to trigger a fair amount of\nultra-violent. Mmm. UK screamo crew Bring Me The Horizon are known for their\nin-your-face sets, and at least one person should lose an eye during their per-formance, so I\u2019ll definitely be there to see it. The \u201cHeaviest Mo Fos\u201d award will\ndefinitely go to experimental madmen Meshuggah, who are guaranteed to make\nyour ears bleed with complex rhythms and never-ending layers of distortion.\nA little out of place among all the metal bands, punk band Billy Talent will have a\nhard time winning over any fans. But to be honest I\u2019m especially looking forward\nto seeing these guys live, kicking and screaming through tunes like \u201cDevil In A\nMidnight Mass\u201d or their breakthrough \u201cTry Honesty\u201d.\nIt is no secret though that the highlight of the day \u2013 if not of the festival \u2013 will be\nseeing the original line-up of Faith No More, featuring my personal Jesus - Mike\nPatton. Screaming along with him and thousands of others to \u201cEpic\u201d or \u201cMidlife\nCrisis\u201d will be a goddamn dream come true.\nDay 2 sees the return of more nu-metal stars (seems to be the theme this year),\nlike Slipknot \u2013 who have actually gotten better since the \u201cdeath\u201d of nu-metal \u2013 and\nthe God Of Fuck himself, Marilyn Manson. Without a doubt, they will tear the\nfestival apart. Electronic rockers Pendulum will probably fail to convince the met-alheads, whereas old-school legends The Prodigy will be just plain awesome.\nI can see it all ready: Ravi and I screaming out the lyrics to \u201cThunder\u201d, downing\nbeers, whilst setting ourselves on fire. Okay maybe that isn\u2019t exactly how it will go\ndown, but it will be something along those lines.\nDay 3 seems a little bit weaker in comparison, but we\u2019ll probably be passed\nout in the tent most of the day anyway. With a bit of luck we\u2019ll get to see prog-metal veterans Dream Theater and groove-metal tyrants Clutch. Not very probable though\u2026\nGreg Power\nRavi Pall\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMusic Festivals\nMusic Festival Editor \u2013 Ravi Pall\n\n"

I selected\nthis topic because I believe it will satisfactorily fill the editorial-shaped hole\nthat currently sits on page x of the food\npages this week.\nAfter successfully draining any possible artistic creativity or wit from my\npoor, poor brain over Easter whilst revising for exams, I have thus attempted\nto put a spring back in my step by trying out some Quick Revision recipes\nfor you all. No doubt the best way to\nincrease productivity while you\u2019re deep\nin papers and notes is to make in bulk,\nuse your fridge and heat up food as\nrequired. Classic bulk bakes are Chilli\nCon Carne (or Chilli Non Carne) or a\nfamily-sized dish of lasagne, but here\nare some alternatives for y\u2019all to try\nout!\nRevision Pasta \u2013 Cook 1 onion and\na clove of garlic in a dash of oil until\nsoftened. Add a pack of turkey mince\nand cook until browned. Then add a\ntin of tomatoes, 2 tbsp tomato puree,\n2 tbsp of sweetcorn, 1 tbsp of mixed\nherbs and chilli powder to taste. Cook\nthe mixture for 20 minutes and season\nSo if you\u2019re staring at your empty\nfridge in halls, with a tenner in your\npocket, get down to Big Easy. Ten\npounds [incredibly] gets you a large\nbowl of 6 very spicy wings with blue\ncheese sauce, a huge portion of the\nbest fries, a deliciously fat burger and a\nchoice of margarita or beer. Beat that,\nWeatherspoons. This is an extremely\nimpressive amount of food for a mere\nten pounds. Whilst writing this, I have\ntried to recreate the size of the burger\nusing my hands and eat it, thus achieving some strange looks from onlookers\nin the library. Yes, readers \u2013 the food\nis so good, you can carry on eating it\neven when it\u2019s not there anymore. (Im-agination required.)\nIf you\u2019re feeling rich and decadent on\na Wednesday, you can spend an extra\n\u00a35 and go to town on some Unlimited\nFajitas. Being presented with Big Easy\u2019s\npile of tortillas, guacamole, chicken,\nsalsa and sour cream must be a similar\nfeeling to that of winning a gold medal\nin the [Fajita] Olympics as your heart\nfills with pride, joy and you start crying\nBig Easy BBQ and Crabshack\n332-334 King\u2019s Road\nwww.bigeasy.com.uk\nBest deals: Repeat after me:\nBurger, fries, wings, beer, ten\npounds.\nwith happiness. I\u2019ve never seen people\nask for a top-up so there\u2019s a challenge\nif any of you boys fancy a testosterone\nfuelled Fajita match pre-Sports Night.\nOther meal deals exist on other days of\nthe week, including an all-you-can-eat\nBBQ on a Monday. Just check the website before you go to see what will be in\nyour belly later.\nProbably due to its reputation for\nfeeding Princes William and Harry\nand their posse, people can be put off\nby the often Dolce-clad people that\nmight be seen lurking inside. Fear not\n\u2013 it\u2019s not just the playground of the rich\nand royal playing at being rustic! The\nclientele is mostly West Londoners,\nlarge groups of friends and families. All\nin all this makes for a pleasantly noisy\natmosphere which fits with the AllAmerican image. Big Easy is incredibly\npopular so I\u2019d book if you are going on\na Friday or Saturday night. Also, live\nmusic is played each night so you can\ngorge on your burger, fries and wings\nto the sound of Sweet Home Alabama.\nPerfecto.\nI\n\u2019d bet you that King\u2019s Road\nwould not be the first place you\nwould think of for a cheap meal.\nHowever, it seems to be the case\nthat the eateries lining this mile\nof high fashion, Chelsea tractors and\nbeautiful pedestrians are keen to cater\nfor people other than those with fifties\nin their hand and a Porsche parked on\nthe curb.\nThe best of these student-friendly\nrestaurants sit on the Evelyn Gardens/\nSouth Kensington end of King\u2019s Road.\nOpposite the amazing Dumpling and\nNoodle Bar and near the gut-busting\nDutch Pancake House sits the legendary crab shack Big Easy. Modelled\non a simple Gulf Coast crab shack,\nBig Easy serves every classic American dish you can dream of: wings,\nribs, burger, lobster, pecan pie, waffles,\ndunkin\u2019 doughnuts\u2026 What makes me\nespecially happy is the fact that (as previously noted) Big Easy is more than\nhappy to cater for those spending \u00a310\njust as much as those splurging \u00a3100,\nas student-loan-friendly meal deals\ngrace the menu every night of the week\n- just make sure you stay clear of the \u00e0\nla carte\u2026 Bye bye loan, hello lobster!\nServes 4\n2 tbsp olive oil\n1 red onion\n2 cloves garlic, crushed\n400g cooked potatoes, cubed\n150g frozen peas\nHandful of mint\n200g feta cheese\n6 eggs, beaten and seasoned\nIn a large frying pan, fry the red onion in the oil until soft and\ngolden. Add the garlic, cooked potatoes and peas. Cook for 3\nminutes, or until the potatoes have a bit of colour. Add the mint\nand cheese and give the mixture a good stir before adding the\neggs.\nAs soon as the eggs hit the pan stir them until the mixture is\nwell coated and the eggs have started to cook. Cook the tortilla\non a low heat for 8-10 minutes then place under a hot grill for 2\nminutes to cook the top. Serve in quarters with a big green salad\nand a warm baguette.\nFeta, Pea and Mint\nTortilla\nwell. Stir in 300g cooked pasta. Serve\nwith some salad, if you like. If you\u2019re\nmaking this in bulk, make sure you reheat it properly.\nHotpot \u00e0 la felix \u2013 Cook 400g sau-sages, 100g bacon and a red onion in\n1 tbsp oil until well done. Add a tin of\ntomatoes. Rinse out the tin with water\nand add the tomatoey water too, with\n2 tbsp dark sugar. Add a tin of chickpeas and 2-3 sweet potatoes. Bring to\nthe boil then bake in the oven for 30\nminutes. Serve in a bowl with parsley\nand a hunk [of bread]. This can be easily reheated in the microwave.\nTea Break Cake \u2013 For all that work\navoidance, there is nothing better than\na nice homemade cake. Soak 100g raisins in the juice and rind of one orange\nfor 30 minutes. Meanwhile, melt 125g\nbutter with 125g light soft brown sugar.\nTo this mixture add 2 eggs, 3 mashed\nbananas, the raisin/orange mix and\n200g self raising flour, sieved. Pour all\nof this into a greased loaf tin and back\nat 170\u00b0C for 50 minutes.\nDespite being rather recipe-heavy\nthis week, I couldn\u2019t help adding the\ngreen-themed Tortilla recipe shown\nbelow in honour of the start of Spring\nand to remind us that sometimes when\ntrees turn green, they like to spread\ntheir seed more than a 16 year old chav\nfrom Stockport. Laters, my homies.\nGet Stuffed for a Tenner\nIf not actively ignorant, it seems that\nit would be awfully unwise not to start\na discussion on Public Houses with\na brief mention of Orwell\u2019s description of the perfect pub. After all, his\njudgement retrospectively is so sound,\nthat it would be unlikely that his take\non public houses should be anything\nless than revelatory (even if decidedly\ntongue-in-cheek).\nTo summarise, Orwell claims that the\nperfect pub, which he calls \u2018The Moon\nUnder Water\u2019 is largely equivalent to\nits atmosphere. It should be Victorian\n(genuinely so) and comfortably ugly. It\nis frequented mostly by regulars whose\nnames the motherly barmaids know. It\nserves draught stouts in vessels with\nhandles. It has a garden for families.\nIt dispenses good cheap meals. It is\nreasonably quiet and has no music or\nradio.\nIt was this set of criteria that led\nWetherspoons to create its chain of\npubs (most of whose names contain\nthe word \u2018moon\u2019). That JD followed the\nletter of the law as much as possible\nwhile ignoring the spirit of the it is in\nthe nature of chain operations, though\nI would freely admit it that when it suc-ceeds, it does tick some spiritual boxes,\ntoo. And it\u2019s absurdly cheap.\nI would contend that it is impossible\nto conceive, these days, in London, of\nanything even moderately approaching\nwhat Orwell described. Firstly, Londoners rarely stay put for very long, so\nare continually changing \u2018locals\u2019 giving\nlittle opportunity to make any lasting\nconnection with the motherly bar-maids. Secondly, the meagre amounts\navailable for bar work offered by most\nestablishment tend to preclude any\nmotherly tendency to call everyone\n\u2018dear\u2019. Thirdly, no-one drinks stouts;\nso that where they do occur, they are\nlikely to be vinegary (they have a very\nshort shelf-life). Lastly, if any pub did\nactually tick a high proportion of these\nboxes, it would be rammed full of\nponces like me.\nI broadly agree with Orwell, certainly in that atmosphere is key, though I\nwould insist that the beer is also excel-lent. But it\u2019s worth noting that modern\nconcerns mean that priorities have\nshifted somewhat. For instance, it is\nenough of a battle to get a beer in a\nreal glass that the desire for a handle\ncan be dispensed with, or even to get\nsomething served within half an hour.\n(Seriously, complain when the Union\nwon\u2019t give you a proper glass.) For\nanother instance, barmaids are just as\noften barmen these days. For yet another instance, where he asks for no\nradio, he would now ask for no televi-sion. I would argue that music can be\nacceptable, though it has to be good,\nand a real skill is needed to find exactly\nthe volume necessary to perfume the\nvibe without stinking it out. I would\nalso add to his analysis that the lighting is crucial: it needs to be good and\nvirtually non-existent. The keyword is\n\u2018comfortable\u2019. What Orwell describes is\nwhat he is comfortable with; a situation\nwhich is familiar to him, and of which\nhe himself is a familiar inhabitant. In\nshort, a pub should be a womb.\nUnfortunately London does not have\nany wombs. But there do exist a small\nclutch of pubs (and bars!) scattered far\nand wide throughout London which at\nleast have a little amniotic fluid sloshing about. These include The Wenlock\nArms, (26 Wenlock Road, N1), The\nMicrobar (14 Lavender Hill, SW11),\nThe Charles Dickens (SE1 0LH), The\nHarp (WC2N 4HS) and The Royal Oak\n(SE1 4JU).\nA London Guide to Pubs\nDavid Stewart\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\nWhen the director gets it wrong...\nThere is a fine line between bad and\ngood, on both sides of the terms.\nNaturally, most attention is garnered\nby those films which fall in the latter\ncategory, and it is most deservedly so.\nBut there\u2019s also a lot to be learned by\nwatching some of the less glorious cinematic achievements that have blessed\n(cursed) the screens and the eyes of\nman along the years. They shed light\non the whole spectrum of film-making\nability, highlighting the fatal flaws that\nruin the more refined part of the mov-ie-going experience. Whether it\u2019s horrendous acting, ridiculous writing, un-focused directing, or a mix of these and\nseveral other factors, the truth is that a\nbad film is always to be preferred to a\nmediocre one: there\u2019s nothing worse\nthan being in the middle of the road,\nneither good enough to be listened\nto, nor bad enough to be laughed at \u2013\nfilmwise, of course. The only exception\nrefers to comedies, which are generally\nthe least enjoyable kind of bad mov-ies, as recent history has clearly highlighted through this swarm of very low\nbrow parodies that has invaded us in\nthe new millennium.\nWith this in mind, it is worth taking a\nlook at three movies that are generally\nacknowledged to be among the worst\never made and checking whether they\nhave any redeeming qualities to render\nthem watchable. While it may be a bit\nmean spirited, the truth is that anyone who can\u2019t laugh about his or her\nblunders should re-examine the moral\nimperatives of life - and if one cannot\nwill it to become a universal law, then\nperhaps a career change is in order.\nAlone in the Dark (2005)\nUwe Boll\u2019s second \u201chit\u201d is pretty\nmuch defining of most of the German\u2019s\nmovies. Big budgets, famous actors,\nimportant franchises \u2013 all turned into\na pile of rubbish in a highly consistent\nfashion. The main problem with Boll\u2019s\nworks of film is that he tries so desperately to conform to Hollywood standards and stereotypes, which comes\ncoupled with generally poor special\neffects and tediously uninteresting\nscripts. It\u2019s true that simply taking on\na video-game movie (as Boll has so\noften done) is a pain in itself as far as\nthe writing is concerned, but given that\nBoll isn\u2019t even that passionate about\nstaying loyal to the story or the fans\nmeans this excuse doesn\u2019t hold.\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to say that I\u2019ve enjoyed any of the German\u2019s disasters. I\nfind that I have too much respect for\nsome of the actors that sell their souls\nin his projects to relish their failure,\nwhile the writing rarely goes into the\n\u201cso bad it\u2019s good category\u201d and maintains a fair level of blandness through-out. Moreover, I sometimes get completely lost in the messy action directed\nby Boll, which can go so far as to make\nme close my eyes in the attempt of convincing myself there are no monsters.\nSo as far as Boll is concerned, watching one of his films is enough to get an\nidea of what you can expect and any\ndecent human being just has to see at\nleast one film from the most famous\nbad director around \u2013 or at least the\nhistoric \u201cfast motion \u2013 slow motion in\none scene\u201d bit from Far Cry\nOn a related matter, I highly recommend Alone in the Dark II (2008),\nwhich was one of the most delightful\nbad movies I have ever seen. Out of respect for it, all I can say is: \u201cDon\u2019t wor-ry. It only kills the soul, not the body\u201d.\nFrom Justin to Kelly (2003)\nSimilarly to Gigli, this was one of\nthose films that quickly rose to fame\nbecause of how bad they were. Basically, this musical about several college kids having some fun at a sort of\nsummer camp was an attempt to make\nsome money and rush the rise to fame\nof two contestants on American Idol. I\ncould easily go on a rant here in regard\nto how much these shows ruin the life\nof many good TV series because nothing truly good can compete on equal\ngrounds with them, and the battle\nfor ratings just forces the networks to\nsearch for a lowest common denomi-nator. But I won\u2019t, because somehow I\ncould ignore this abominable state of\naffairs and actually found that From\nJustin to Kelly is not the complete disaster I expected it to be.\nFrom a musical labelled among the\nworst ever made, I expected tragic\nsinging performances, because that\u2019s\nwhere its strength lies. However, while\nI\u2019m definitely no big fan of traditional\nmusicals, I couldn\u2019t say that this one\nwas shockingly more unlikable than\nthe others I\u2019ve seen. Most of the actors\nwere even adept enough to keep the\nutterly predictable and mostly retarded story flowing without major inci-dent. Beyond the dancing and the sing-ing, which didn\u2019t upset me more than\nusual, it\u2019s the highly disjointed way\nthe film comes together that makes it\nseem amateurish. Ironically as it may\nseem, another twenty minutes to it\nwould have rounded it into something\nthat would not have been far beyond in\nterms of \u201creal quality\u201d to most mediocre films that have come out recently.\nAs it stands, From Justin to Kelly is little more than a bunch of songs strung\ntogether on film.\nSome have considered it as one of the\nmost likable bad movies ever made and\nI reckon there is some truth to that: it\u2019s\ndefinitely watchable and at times, a joy\nto make fun of.\nManos: The Hands of Fate (1966)\nWritten, directed and starring HaIt seems to me that there has been\na spate of films in 3D recently. Well,\nspate isn\u2019t exactly the right word. Off\nthe top of my head, only Monsters vs.\nAliens and Coraline spring to mind,\nbut there are more waiting just around\nthe temporal corner \u2013 including a \u201crockumentary\u201d about the Jonas Brothers...\nugh!\nIf you\u2019re like me, the mention of 3D\nfilms harks back to a period in the 90s,\nwhen you would go to see cheap, sec-ond-rate films wearing cheap, second-rate paper glasses. It was a time when\nstudios thought that instead of decent\nacting or witty scripts, they could pull\nin the crowds with gimmicky special\neffects. It is a tragedy that an otherwise\ngood film must suffer because it has\nto parade a ropey 3D effect in front of\neverything.\nWith this nostalgia in mind, I was a\nlittle cautious of going to see the above\nfilms \u2013 not to mention the fact that\nthey are aimed at kids when I am at an\nage when people begin to call me \u201csir\u201d.\nBut I was very pleasantly surprised by\nboth Monsters vs. Aliens and Coraline.\nMonsters vs. Aliens is about a very\nnormal young woman, Susan (Reese\nWitherspoon), who, after an unfortunate accident with a radioactive me-teorite, grows to become a giantess.\nSwiftly captured by the US govern-ment, she makes friends with the other\n\u201cmonsters\u201d being held. With the threat\nof alien invasion, they are Earth\u2019s last\nchance at survival \u2013 that or nukes.\nThe plot doesn\u2019t deviate much from\nthe established formulas of superhero\nand alien films, but it still manages to\nbe entertaining. What really won me\nover, however, was the quirky collection of characters, each one making\nme laugh in their own special way. Of\nspecial note is Dr. Cockroach, a mad\nscientist, played by Hugh Laurie, a\nmad scientist. Even now, I don\u2019t know\nwhether Laurie was speaking in his native accent, or a British impersonation\nin his American one.\nCoraline is the other 3D film in cinemas now. Based on the book by Neil\nGaiman (\u2018American Gods\u2019, \u2018Neverwhere\u2019) and directed by Henry Selick\n(The Nightmare Before Christmas),\nthis is a dark tale of an adventurous\nyet bored girl as she explores her dull,\nboring new home and the fantastic and\nwonderful other-world hidden behind\na door in the living room.\nNeil Gaiman never does things by\nthe numbers and his name is a synonym for strange. Coupled with Selick,\nit makes for entertaining, exciting\ncorkscrew of a plot. Coraline (Dakota\nFanning) and her parents are relatively\nnormal but the other residents in the\napartment complex define and defy\nthe eccentric. The music and the artwork are both stunning and this film is\na treat for all the senses. Out of the two\nfilms, this is easily my favourite.\nBut what of the dreaded third di-mension? Are these just the bastard\noffspring of those horrible 3D films of\nmy childhood? No. In both films, the\n3D effect is used to enhance, not re-place, the story being told. It\u2019s less intrusive and more intuitive. This is how\nit should be done.\nAnd the glasses themselves have\nrold P. Warren, a fertilizer salesman\nfrom Texas. Now, compared to this\nhere creation, the previous two titles\ndon\u2019t stand a chance: Manos succeeds\nin surpassing them on all levels, which\nmakes it a glorious achievement in bad\nfilmmaking.\nWhile some of its issues clearly arise\nfrom the film\u2019s very low budget, it is\nthis in the end which provided the\ncatalyst that turned Manos into a story\nfor the ages. There are loads of goodies to be enjoyed here, from a wonderfully weird character called Torgo, with\nbulging knees that must have aimed to\ninspire fear and terror, to disappearing\nchildren and dogs, as well as a secondary storyline that consists of a couple\nkissing for hours on end, which has\nno connection to the main plot whatsoever \u2013 and if you get overwhelmed,\nthere are always some nice scenic shots\nStefan Carpanu\ncome a long way as well. Instead of\nflimsy paper and acetate that gives you\npaper-cuts on your ears, it\u2019s all made of\nplastic. As eyewear goes, they\u2019re a bit\ntacky but they\u2019re not the reason you\nbought the ticket. Modelling them in\nthe mirror after the film, they remind\nvaguely of Buddy Holly.\nIn summary, I think we may have\nfinally turned a corner in 3D cinema.\nThe equipment has improved, and so\nhave the films \u2013 greatly. Even on DVD,\nwhen the 3D effect is lost, these films\nwill still be a treasure to watch.\nRhys Davies\n...and when they get it right...\n\u201cAlone in the Dark\u201d ranks 44 on IMDB worst movies list. Wonder why?\nThe bright colors and blond hair - all blinding after a night in the library\nto take your mind of planning holidays\nand maybe force you to consider the\nmonotony of human affairs.\nThe fact is Manos was a lot of fun\nto watch, ranking next to Alone in the\nDark II, as one of the most delightful\nbad movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. The same way some\nfilms are too good for words, this set of\nmoving pictures is just about as good\nin levels of bad. Even if \u201cthe Master\nwould not approve\u201d, watching Manos\nis an imperative for anyone who enjoys\nmaking fun of bad films.\nThis is Manos: hands of fate!\nThe terrifying monsters of BOB, Susan and The Missing Link from Monsters vs Aliens\n27\nFriday 15 May 2009 felix\n\n"

That last statement\nmay surprise some readers but don\u2019t\nworry, medic guerrilla hit squads\nhaven\u2019t stormed the newspaper office\nand staged a coup. This really is an\nICSMstoryinfelix.Andwhileofcourse\nthis election bares more relevance to\nmedical students, the results are likely\nto have repercussions throughout the\nuniversity. Sixteen positions are up for\ngrabs with the most interesting being\npresident, and who to replace the incumbent Mark Chamberlain?\nAs in the recent ICU elections, following a shock last minute withdrawal,\nonly one candidate is in the race for the\ntop job. That man is Anil Chopra, so\non a sunny (but cold!) Monday afternoon I decided to meet this third year\nmedic and try and understand what his\npresidential campaign was all about.\nAnil arrived in the Beit Quad, and after some light chitchat we got straight\ndown to the meat and bones of the in-terview. What motivation did this man\nhave to want a year out from his medical studies to take on this sabbatical\nrole? For the CV-whores there are, after all, several positions of responsibility which don\u2019t require such a large expenditure of time and effort. A need to\ngive back to the medical school which\nhas apparently given him so much, as\nwell as the honour of leading one of the\ncountry\u2019s top medical institutions was\nhis answer. Conversation got slightly\nmore interesting with the mention of\nformer ICSMSU president, and Anils\u2019\ncousin Shiv Chopra. While declaring\nthat this had nothing to do with his\nown decision to run Anil also added\nthat Shiv was an inspiration to all stu-dents, including himself. Certainly\nthere can be no arguing with that, his\nachievements formally recognised\nwith an Outstanding Service Award\nfrom the Union. When the inevitable comparison came up Anil seemed\nmost uncomfortable, \u201cI hate the idea\nof comparing the two Chopras\u201d and\nfinished off saying that he would do a\n\u201cdifferent\u201d job.\nSo what are the issues within the\nmedical school that warrant attention?\nThe first thing Anil mentioned was\neducation, whether this was a subconscious sign of his priorities or merely\nco-incidental I\u2019m not sure. Currently\nthe medical school curriculum is going through a wholesale facelift, resulting in more than just a few nips and\ntucks. With the current culture in the\nNHS being one of change for changes\nsake, Anil sought to assure me that he would\nget all relevant opinions\nbefore anything was rubber stamped and that he\nwould make sure that any\nchanges made would be\nfor the good of the medical school. Another point\nAnil brought up was the\ncurrent expansion of degrees offered by ICSM.\nIn addition to quite obviously offering medicine,\nthe medical school also\noffers biomedical science\nand starting next year\npharmacology as part of\nits undergraduate degrees. While this\nexpansion is to be lauded, it remains to\nbe seen whether these students can be\nfully integrated within the school and\nits ethos, without feeling victimised or\nshunned for not being \u201creal\u201d medics as\nis arguably the case now.\nRecent surveys about student satisfaction in the medical school have\noften been quite positive (especially in\ncomparison to the main college) but\none issue which often crops up is the\ndominance of alcohol within ICSM\nsocials. Maybe it\u2019s to do with the high\nstress levels but rightly or wrongly\none of the enduring traits of being a\nmedical student has always been the\nheavy drinking culture. Anil quoted\nthe clich\u00e9 that you don\u2019t have to drink\nto have fun, while at the same time\nemphasising that there was no question of changing any of the big ticket\nevents such as the Roadshow which\nare by nature booze fueled affairs. Of\ncourse, events like these are the highlight of many a freshers experience, but\nit is important not to ignore and alienate the significant minority who don\u2019t\ndrink for whatever reasons.\nConsidering the hateful scorn with\nwhich most non-medics are seen by\nmedical students, I wondered what\npotentially the next president thought\nof IC. Half expecting a string of exple-tives, I was surprised to hear the man\ntalk of there being a friendly rivalry\nwhich exists \u201conly on the pitch\u201d, and\nhow there wasn\u2019t really a separation\nbetween medics and non-medics at\nImperial. However when probed fur-ther, Anil admitted to the divide but instead of talking about ways of increasing unity, argued that this division was\nnecessary and how the medical school\nethos couldn\u2019t be incorporated into the\nmain university. Perhaps this is true,\nbut without trying how do we know?\nWe talked a little about the issue of\nwelfare,somethingwhichcropsupwith\nan uneasy regularity in Union politics.\nA recent ICSMSU student survey highlighted this area as one requiring over-haul, but despite this Anil confidently\nclaimed \u201cthere is a pretty good welfare\nsystem\u201d. The current year\n1 and 2 academic officer,\ndid, however, express his\ndisappointment at the\npersonal tutor system.\nThe problem in essence\nis that people only go to\ntheir tutors when something really goes wrong.\nAnil told me the system\ndoesn\u2019t have to work like\nthat. But with many of\nthe people employed as\ntutors being busy academics or clinicians with\nlittle time for students, it\nremains to be seen how it\ncan be any different. The\nproblem of personal tutors not only\naffects the medical school, and has\noften been brought up at main ICU\nmeetings.\nAnil seemed keen on bringing up the\nReynolds Bar (the Union bar at Charing Cross Hospital), and how he felt it\nwasn\u2019t being used to its fullest extent.\nThis may be true as the Reynolds bar is\noften empty several nights a week, but\nhe didn\u2019t really offer any concrete plans\nto use this potential.\nThroughout the interview, one thing\nwhich was evident was the lack of any\nnew or interesting ideas to truly excite\nme about this election campaign. No\nplans to introduce complimentary Thai\nmasseurs in lecture theatres, nothing\nabout a Playboy-esque hot tub in the\nReynolds, nothing that is really going\nto get people talking. What there was\nthough was an infectious enthusiasm\nfor the medical school and a real desire\nto engage with the students. At several\npoints during the questioning the interview was turned on its head, and Anil\nasked me what my thoughts were. It\ndidn\u2019t feel like he was using this as a get-out clause, it felt like he genuinely cared\nand wanted my take on the issue. In\nseveral answers he stressed the need to\nreach out to all students and to be accessible to anyone who wants to meet the\npresident. Both admirable endeavours\nand ones that fit in with his approachable demeanour. At times the discussion did get heated, but Anil always\nremained calm and measured. The only\nexception to this was when asked for a\nphoto; he almost broke down as he had\nnot \u201cdone his hair\u201d! From this short interview it was quite evident how much\nenergy and passion had been put into\nthis campaign, if I was RON I would\ncertainly be very worried indeed.\nA new face to an old name\nThe Chopra Dynasty\n\u201cI hate the idea\nof comparing\nthe two\nChopras.

The tightly squashed\ncrowd chuckled and urged her on as\nshe weaved her cynical story of love,\nmissing a stitch here and there to grimace at the incompetence of the sound\ntechnician.\nEarlier that day, I had received a text,\n\u201cLaura Marling is playing a secret gig\ntonight at The Flower Pot in Kentish\nTown, I\u2019m told it\u2019s free\u201d\n. In the time-hon-oured tradition of Secret Gigs I received\nthis news at the worst possible time. Sat\nin a meeting, I heard my phone buzz\nand glanced down to see the news. Unfortunately I was sat in a meeting and it\nwas 8 o\u2019clock; it would take over an hour\nto get to Kentish Town\u2026\nI played my hand. \u201cExcuse me, I really have to go\u201d, I interrupted. \u201cWhat\u2019s\nthe matter?\u201d came the reply. I hesitated,\nthe window of opportunity was slowly\nclosing and the gig inching ever closer.\nThe truth would not do, would not justify my leaving\u2026 \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d, I dashed for\nthe door and fled down the stairs, to\nhell with the consequences!\nDown the stairs, across the road, I\nsprinted all the way to the tube station.\nA fellow commuter, sprinted up beside\nme. He looked at me quizzically, asking \u201cLate as well?\u201d. \u201cYes! I\u2019m going to\na gig! It\u2019s free you should come!\u201d. Unsurprisingly, the 50-something man\nwith a briefcase and a train to catch\ndeclined my offer and then proceeded\nto accelerate ahead of me. In a word,\nhumiliating.\nThe crowd at The Flower Pot had\nnot quite reached bursting point when\nI arrived but before long there were\nfans hanging from the rafters, occupying every nook and cranny of the 200\ncapacity venue.\nRather quietly, she jaunted onto\nstage and began to set up. She would\nbe solo tonight with a solitary cellist\nfor accompaniment. Laura Marling\nhas a peculiar stage presence, entirely\ndisarming. It\u2019s as if she doesn\u2019t realize\nthat she\u2019s standing in front of a whole\ncrowd of adoring fans who dropped all\ntheir engagements to see her perform.\nShe gives the impression that one\ncould perk up, \u201cY\u2019alright Laura?\u201d and\nstrike up an impromptu chat while she\ntuned her guitar.\nThe crowd cheered as she was introduced as \u201cThe Lovely Laura Marling\u201d\nbut unfortunately the gig was to go\ndownhill from this point.\nHer set was plagued by feedback\nfrom her guitar. At first it was minor\ninconvenience and she laughed it off\nwith a shrug. The audience too, smiled\nback sympathetically. As it continued,\nLaura Marling took it in her stride altering her song order to avoid quieter\nsongs (although I wondered if this was\nactually because half the people at the\nback of the pub talked loudly throughout her set).\nAfter a few songs and no improvement with the sound, she abandoned\nthe mic completely and attempted to\nplay without any amplification. A bold\nmove that could have worked had it\nnot been for the fans who decided that\ntheir conversations were more interesting (don\u2019t get me started on the people who thought we had come to hear\nthem sing).\nThus with an uncooperative mic and\nsimilarly uncooperative audience, Laura Marling departed the stage after 5 or\nso songs. Despite being interrupted by\nfeedback, her new songs sound bloody\nfantastic and give every indication that\nher second album, which is due to be\nreleased sometime this year, is going to\nimpress.\nLaura Marling\n@ The Flower Pot\n12th May\nAlex Ashford\nMusic Editor\nSlit your\nwristbands\nH\ney, it\u2019s 2009, one year\naway from the futuristic sounding 2010, and\nas my global change\nbiology course informs\nme, very near to some sort of space-age climate apocalypse where we will\nall dress like astronauts and have to\ndodge tsunamis and hurricanes on our\nway into work every morning. Sounds\nawesome, right? Like living in a Bruce\nWillis movie directed by Daft Punk.\nBut why then, are so many people so\nobsessed with clinging onto the past?\nThe past sucks! The past is full of shitty\nboyfriends who wrote bad poetry on\ntheir jeans, times when getting drunk\nfrequently meant being sick in someone else\u2019s front lawn, and times when\nyou thought the band Placebo were\ncool.\nI\u2019m talking about those people who\nwear festival wristbands way after\nthat festival has ended. Those little\nslivers of polyester rags have the effect of instantly transforming your\nlook from normal guy into complete\ndickhead. Last night I went to a spur\nof the moment Laura Marling gig in\nKentish Town and found myself standing next to one such guy. I asked him\nwhy he was wearing those horrid festival wristbands and he confessed to\nme that it was because they represent\nhappy memories of the few times he\ndidn\u2019t feel suicidal and he couldn\u2019t bear\nto get rid of them. I wasn\u2019t sure if he\nwas joking because, as someone who\nwears festival wristbands, it\u2019s obviously\npossible it could be true. Anyway I told\nhim that if he\u2019s that pathetic he probably should just kill himself already. He\nlaughed, so I\u2019m guessing it was a joke.\nThere are many reasons why those\nwristbands are bad, firstly, because if\nyou wear them, it\u2019s usually because you\nthink it\u2019s a talking point. If you think\ngoing to a really mainstream music festival that 99% of people under 25 have\nbeen to at least once in their life, with\nlots of average bands that everyone has\nheard of, really defines who you are,\nthen you shouldn\u2019t want to advertise it.\nAt least present yourself with a modicum of mystery and the possibility that\nyour tastes aren\u2019t completely average.\nFestival bands are no different to\nthose livestrong wristbands people\nused to wear to show they aren\u2019t fans of\ncancer. No one likes cancer! You don\u2019t\nneed some sort of accessory to show\nthis. At least with those the money\nyou bought it for might actually go to\na cancer charity.\nAs if to prove my point, at the Laura\nMarling gig I turned around and was\nface to face with, in the words of Kadhim, the biggest douche-bag in the\nworld. He was singing along badly to\nevery single song Laura played, drowning out her angelic voice with his own\nfootball hooligan style burblings, and\nyes, he was wearing festival wrist-bands. Point proven. The guy I was\ntalking to had to admit defeat.

Over the\npast couple of terms, there has been\na whole new floor created between\nthe second and third floors of the main\nUnion Building specially for this purpose.\nThe SAC will no longer live in the East\nBasement, but will be located on this\nnew Mezzanine floor - the source of the\nmysterious \u2018M\u2019 button in the lifts.\nThe new Student Activities Centre has\nbeen specially designed to be the hub\nof all Club & Society administration and\nactivity. When it opens next week, it\nwill offer a vastly improved range of\nfacilities for student officers and Clubs\n& Societies. In addition to everything\nbeing brand new and shiny, there will\nbe more computer terminals, more\npigeonholes, upgraded CSC cubbyholes,\nnew swivelly chairs, and two break-out\nareas perfect for small club discussions,\nor CSC Treasurers\u2019 meetings. The\nStudent Activities Centre has also been\ndesigned to maximise space, and will\noffer more lockers for Club & Society\nuse. In addition to all this, the new SAC\nmay unwittingly offer additional health\nbenefits, for, as well as the extra calories\nit may take Club & Society officers to\nget up the stairs, it will provide previous\nbasement dwellers with almost shocking\namounts of extra Vitamin E.\nThe new SAC complex will not only\nhouse the Student Activities Centre,\nbut will also house the Advice Centre,\nso all students will have easy access to\nNigel Cooke, the Student Adviser. The\nMembership Services Team, including\nPhil Power and Alissa Ayling, the Sport\nPartnership Administrator, will have their\nnew offices next to the SAC.\nLooking forward, the improvements\nfor Clubs & Societies, and students\nin general, doesn\u2019t stop here. The\nredevelopment is still going on, with\nthe East Basement to be transformed\ninto a set of brand new meeting rooms,\nand the West wing of the 3rd floor of\nthe main Union\nBuilding will\nbecome a new\nUnion Gym \u2013 with\nmirrors, a sprung\nwooden floor\nperfect for dancing\nand martial arts,\nand larger Club\n& Society stores.\nThis final part of\nthis phase of the\nredevelopment will be completed in time\nfor the new academic year. There will\ninevitably more disruption in the short\nterm while all this work is going on, but it\nwill, as the new Student Activities Centre\nshows, all be worth it in the end.\nIntroducing the New StudentActivities Centre!\nLilyTopham\nDeputy President\n(Clubs&Societies)\ndpcs@imperial.ac.uk\nstudent activities centre\nsac\nimperialcollegeunion.org/clubs\nWhat are Colours?\nColours are a type of award that Imperial\nCollege Union can give to anybody to\nrecognise the service, contribution and\ndedication of someone to the Union.\nThere are five types of Colours that\nare broadly separated into two groups.\nThe first three Colours, which are Half\nColours, Full Colours and Outstanding\nService Awards, are awarded in\nrecognition of one year\u2019s service to the\nUnion. The other two Colours, which\nare Fellowships and Distinguished\nFellowships, are awarded in recognition\nof many year\u2019s service to the Union.\nWho can be nominated for Colours?\nAnybody can be nominated for these\nawards, except the Union Sabbatical\nOfficers and the Felix Editor.\nWho can nominate someone for\nColours?\nAny Imperial student can complete a\nnomination form, but it\u2019s best not to\nnominate yourself!\nWhat happens if you are awarded a\nColours\nBeing awarded a Colours is a great\nhonour and privilege.

It is\ncool to blow smoke\nrings in the library\nthough.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is\nthis? I feel like I\u2019m\nnot killing myself\nwhen I smoke this.\nA good or bad\nthing?\u201d\nI have never been so confused! I want the real cigarette, but I want it indoors. Could CigStar be the answer to all my problems?\nE\nquipped with an almost intimidating desire to save\nthe part of the world which,\nlike myself finds the concept of slow-motion suicide through sucking on an ill-tasting\nstick a good idea, Hon Lik invented the\nElectronic Cigarette. A heavy smoker,\nHon used to smoke no less than two\npacks a day until the death of his father due to lung cancer. This came to\nbe the crucial moment which Lik drew\ninspiration from for his potentially life-changing device.\nIs his idea of the E-Cigarette one that\nsociety could embrace and accept en-masse? Or is it just a massive flake that\nwill instead have the world laughing at\nthe owners of these devices with an air\nof unrestrained disdain?\nAt felix, we were sent a starter pack of\nCigStar, one of the few UK distributors\nof the e-Cigarette. The device looks\nvery much like a cigarette, despite the\nobvious added weight and extra length.\nIt is, undoubtedly, something that\nbased on aesthetics alone should not\nbe immediately discarded. The device\ncontains no tobacco whatsoever and\nworks by replacing cartridges of nicotine and recharging a battery. Inside\nthe cigarette is a heating element that\nvapourises the nicotine for intake and\nat the same time, creates a much-ap-preciated cloud of smoke for the sake\nof realism.\nI was pleasantly surprised. Although\nmy expectations were somewhat low,\nthey were wildly surpassed. The reason\nI like these cigarettes is threefold: I can\nmost definitely feel the nicotine kick\nwhen I take a few drags; the smoke,\nalthough not epic in proportions, is\nthere and is a definite attractive factor,\ndespite being just water vapour; and\nfinally, the thought of smoking in the\nlibrary or in a coffee shop is one that,\nas a heavy smoker, makes me insanely\nhappy. The taste on the other hand, is\nsomething that as of today, leaves much\ntobedesired.Ittasteslikesuckingonan\nold shisha pipe filled with unflavoured\ntobacco without lighting it. This is almost enough to turn me off the device\ncompletely, were it not for my addiction (to novelty gadgets, not nicotine).\nThere is much\nwork to do on\nthis front.\nAround the\nCollege, we\nwere allowed\nto smoke in\nthe library and\nin daVinci\u2019s\nwithout any\nproblem. In\nfact, the cigarette aroused\nmuch curiosity in staff who\nwere all willing\nto try it out.\nWe have gone\naround campus and asked Imperial smokers to\ntry the CigStar Electronic Cigarettes\nand give us their opinions. Consensus\nis mixed, but I have faith in this little\nproduct of vice.\nCigstar\nwww.cigstar.co.uk\nStarter kit w/ 6 cartridges: \u00a334.99\nRefill cartridges: \u00a35 for 5\nC\nome to our office during\nthe weekday and chances\nare you\u2019ll hear some loud\nmusic blasting out of one\nof the iMacs. No, we don\u2019t\nhave a dedicated music library (as far\nas I know) nor do we have the effort to\nplug speakers into someone\u2019s iPod; we\njust use Spotify.\nIf you haven\u2019t already heard of Spotify, here\u2019s a quick description: it is an\nonline jukebox, allowing you to legally\nplay music without downloading or\neven buffering. In fact, Spotify\u2019s slogan\nsums it all up nicely: \u201cA world of mu-sic. Instant, simple and free.\u201d To access\nthe library, it\u2019s just a matter of signing\nup, downloading the simple client software (Windows and Mac supported;\nLinux users can run Spotify in Wine)\nand then start searching.\nWhile the service is still in beta and\nby invitation only, Spotify already has\na huge library of just over three million tracks available to UK users (not\nall tracks are available in some countries due to licensing issues). However,\nthis still excludes many of my favourite\nalbums such as Robbie Williams\u2019 \u201cSing\nWhen You\u2019re Winning\u201d (although\nmost of his other albums are available),\nUtada\u2019s latest album and most of Alison Krauss\u2019 albums. You should be fine\nwith the latest tracks though.\nLike most other music players you\ncan build your own playlists or queue\nsongs in Spotify. What I would love to\nsee is a playlist import wizard so that\nyou won\u2019t have to start from nothing. I\nwould guess most people won\u2019t bother\nwith this anyway: if you don\u2019t mind\nlistening to just one artist for a while,\nSpotify does have a useful \u201cPopularity\u201d\nsorting option - something that iTunes\nand Windows Media Player lack - to\nlet you listen to the best tracks straight\naway. Alternatively, you can click on\nthe artist\u2019s name to see a list of similar\nartists or a list of albums that the artist\nappears on.\nOne feature that Spotify urgently\nneeds to add is something similar to\niTunes\u2019 Genius, which gives you a list\nof tracks that are similar to a chosen\ntrack or the one you are listening to.\nThe only thing closest to this is Spotify\u2019s \u201cRadio\u201d which lets you pick a period and genres, and it will output a\nlandscape list of album covers containing the matching tracks.\nFor some bizarre reason you can\u2019t\nscroll along the list, so you would have\nto keep skipping tracks until you find\none that you like.\nThe only real black spot is Spotify\u2019s\nadvertisements. The occasional advert banner in the interface is fine, but\nit\u2019s the intrusive and repetitive audio\nclips that become rather annoying\nafter a while. You would also soon be\nable to memorise the words spoken\nby Spotify\u2019s \u201ccharity muggers\u201d, as The\nIndependent\u2019s Tim Walker calls them,\nasking you to consider their ad-free\npremium service. I don\u2019t mind them\nthough as long as it\u2019s \u201cRoberta from\nSpotify\u201d. She\u2019s hot.\nVerdict: great stuff, almost there.\nSpotify - the future of music radio?\nIt\u2019s free and it\u2019s legal, but surely this is a dream too good to be true? Not that good, says Richard Lai.\n\u201cSpotify\ncurrently has\nover three\nmillion tracks\u201d\nSpotify\u2019s anatomy\nWatch out, iTunes and Windows Media Player! Spotify will probably gobble you up with its free music! (Songbird is elsewhere on the map)\nSearch history\nSearch bar\nRadio\nPlay queue\nPlaylists\nGo premium for ad-free Spotify! (\u00a39.99 per\nmonth or \u00a399 a year)\nNo thanks!\nThe ad banner\nthat appears\nevery now and\nthen (sometimes\nlandscape at the\nbottom)\nPopularity\nAlbum cover\nSearch filters\nShuffle and repeat\ncontrols\nPlayback controls Seek bar\nThe badly designed \u201cRadio\u201d interface - you can\u2019t scroll along the list! The artist profile page where you can check out top hits and albums.\n\u201cWe were\nallowed to\nsmoke in the\nlibrary and in\ndaVinci\u2019s without\nany problem.\u201d\n\n"

The sun was out and\nSunday looked like it was going to be a\nbrilliant day to play some cup winning\nlacrosse.\nArriving at Teddington, it was apparent that we were going to be up against\nsomestrongopposition.TheUCLteam\nhad arrived far earlier and with a long\nwarm up and bringing along an army\nof supporters, looked strong. However,\nhaving already beaten them once already this year, the Imperial team knew\nthey could finish the job. Despite having to change on the side lines to save\ntime and having little time to warm up,\nat 1.45pm, the game kicked off.\nUCL started extremely strongly,\npressuring the defence heavily but\nfantastic work from the likes of Sam\nJayaweera, Elsa Butrous and Becky\nSingh kept them at bay, denying them\ntime and time again. Imperial capitalised on every missed UCL opportunity\nand with UCL unable to deal with the\npace of star scorer Ian Hunt and captain Akira Fukutomi, the first quarter\nended 3 \u2013 0 to Imperial.\nUCL came back with a vengeance in\nthe second and third quarters and Imperial was hard pressed to stay ahead.\nThe defence proved themselves again,\nkeeping UCL at bay and the pairing\nof Flo Slater and Ian in midfield made\nsure that UCL was given no room to\nbreathe.\nGoing into the final quarter, Imperial was still ahead but UCL mounted\na formidable offence. Goal opportunities came thick and fast at both ends,\nwith 6 year veteran, Chris Allen towering over the UCL players and keeping the shots at goal going. The final\n15 minutes were possibly the longest\nexperienced by any player, but the final whistle was eventually blown and\nImperial emerged victorious, winning\n6-5. For the first time in their history,\nthe Imperial mixed lacrosse team had\nsecured both the ULU league and the\nChallenge Cup, with a completely undefeated season.\nUCL had provided us with the hardest game we had played to date and after receiving the winner\u2019s medals and\nCaptain Akira Fukutomi lifting the\nChallenge Cup, both teams congratulated each other on an extremely tough\nmatch.\nThe game provided an absolutely\nbrilliant end to a fantastic season, both\non and off of the pitch. Despite the\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s teams being spread\nthinly with their many other additional\nleague commitments, team solidarity\nkept us working well together to finally\nbring home the victory. Our many socials and sports nights have been really\nimportant to cement us as both individual teams and a club as a whole. It\u2019s\nnot until you\u2019ve seen someone drink\nfrom a lacrosse stick and then vomit\nsnakebite out their nose that you truly\nget to know them.\nThis year had been phenomenal\nfor Imperial Lacrosse. Winning both\nthe ULU mixed league and Challenge\nCup, putting the women\u2019s team in the\ntop 16 in the country, the men having\nan extremely successful first season,\nbut most importantly, winning ICSM\nSports Club Of The Year 2008-2009!\nWe are all looking forward to a new\nseason of lacrosse in the autumn and\nwelcoming some new faces to our incredible club!\nChris Baldwin\nImperial\nstudents\nBUCk Up!\nChristina Duffy\nFive gold, twenty-eight silver and four\nbronze medals were won by Imperial crews at the National Water Sports\nCentre in Nottingham last weekend.\nThis places Imperial fourth in the rowing BUCS championship table with 87\npoints behind overall winners Durham\n(184 points). The ICBC team was congratulated by Head of Sport Imperial\nNeil Molsey whose boat namesake was\nraced in throughout the weekend. 72\nindividual races by IC crews combined\nto a distance coverage of over 288 kilo-metres, 144 km of which were at race-pace. There were victories across the\nboard in all categories and boat types\nwith gold secured in Mlwt2x, MI2-,\nWB1x and MB1x.\nIn the men\u2019s intermediate pairs\n(MI2-) Danny Symmonds and Alex\nGillies claimed the first medals of the\ncompetition for ICBC and cruised\nthrough the opening heat into the\nsemi-final. The pair lined up in the\nfinal against Durham A, B, C and D\nand after hanging back for most of\nthe race made their killer move within\n100 metres to win by 0.12 seconds.\nAnnouncers were aghast at the brutal\nacceleration; \u201cWait\u2026 I think\u2026 yes!\nImperial have taken the lead, can they\nhave? Yes\u2026 Durham weren\u2019t expecting\nthis! No one was expecting this.\u201d The\nduo was cool coming off the water attributing their win to \u201csheer skill\u201d. The\nmen\u2019s lightweight double of Adam\nFreeman-Pask and Oli Mahony took\npole position in their heat by 12.67\nseconds. Durham again put up a good\neffort sacrificing Durham A, B and C\nto the IC crew in the final. When asked\nafterwards if it was a tough race there\nwas much laughter: \u201cNo.\u201d\nWith such a vast quantity of entries\nthere was little time between races and\nseveral athletes had to sprint straight\nfrom one boat to another. The women\u2019s\nintermediate quad (WI4x: Stainthorp/\nDuffy/Philips/Bromley) had to ignore\nimpatient Marshals\u2019 urging the crew\nThe winning mixed team pose with the impressive trophy\n\n"

Mainly cos you all drink me beer,\nyou swallow it by the ball sack load!\nYou\u2019re one of me best customers and\nthe thought of loosing that would end\nme.\nHangman\nBall sack load?\nJohn Smith\nYeah, every barrel of me beer gets\na little something special, something\nonly I can provide... ohhh yes...\nHangman\nRight, let\u2019s ignore that and move\nonto the clubs you have.

These accusations are normally nothing more\nthan students being upset at not getting what they want, but this year there\nseems to be some validity behind the\naccusations. The Chairman and Treasurer of the Athletics Clubs Committee\n(ACC), the body that is responsible for\nthe numerous sports teams at Imperial, have been accused of extreme fa-vouritism over their own clubs when it\ncame to allocating budgets for the next\nacademic year.\nSamuel Furse, who is ACC Chair is\nalso the Chair of the Riding and Polo\nClub, whilst Joseph Lees is the ACC\nTreasurer and Chair of the Imperial\nVectors, the basketball club at ICU.\nBoth of these clubs saw their budget\nincrease by over \u00a32,000 compared to\nthe previous year, and since the two\npeople that have a large influence on\nthe eventual outcome on the budget\nare the Chair and Treasurer, it is not\nsurprising that there have been accusations thrown about. At the same time,\nICU Football Club, who have been in\nthe spotlight over their actions at Hammersmith earlier this year, saw a \u00a32,000\nreduction in their budget, specifically\nin the travel section.\nWhen questioned over their deci-sions, Mr Furse told felix that:\n\u201cI did not do the allocations at any\nstage of Phase II of budgeting for the\nriding and polo club, and Joseph the\nsame for Basketball, we did the other\u2019s,\nand this as well as the allocations made\nwas verbally agreed as fair by a well-in-formed CSC colleague who possesses\nno ACC membership.\u201d\nMr Furse went on to explain that \u201cIn\nthe last three years, as treasurer (06-07) and chair (07-09) of riding & polo I\nhave more than doubled the membership of the club. The costs of ground\nhire have gone up by 25% (we are not\nable to train at any other yard under\nBUCS rules, and no other yard in the\nSE of England could cope with our\nnumbers) to \u00a325ppph, still a significant\ndiscount on the prices paid by ordinary\nmembers of the public. We have also\nintroduced polo as an activity as it is\notherwise no longer available to IC\nstudents since they are no longer UL.\nThe club\u2019s funding has not increased\nto help with any of these factors \u2013 in\nfact our ground hire was cut last year\nand no explanation was given, despite\nat least two requests.\u201d\n\u201cIf the Riding and Polo club were to\nbe funded as it was per person three\nyears ago, the club would receive an\nannual budget of around \u00a319k from\nthe ACC. The ground hire award for\n09-10 to Riding & polo was 55% of the\nI\nCU prides themselves on their\nclubs and societies. Without\nquestion, in my opinion, the one\nthing the union does well is sup-port, fund and encourage the\nparticipation of the student population\ninto extra curricular activities.\nFor most it is a light relief from relentless exams and coursework deadlines which make the \u2018university experience\u2019 slightly less exciting at IC than\nat other universities. Hence I don\u2019t\nthink university students should be\ncomplaining about the state of the financial and organisational conundrum\nthat the union faces, but we should\nsupport and get involved in finding\na better solution. I say this from ex-perience. It is often the case whereby\nsomeone will step up to the mark, put\ntheir hand up and take the lead only\nto find that they then become isolated\nfrom the minions and therefore have\nto make individual decisions which are\nnot necessarily the popular ones. Here\nwe have this situation where Furse and\nLees have taken on selfless responsibility for the benefit of others, have made\ndecisions that they think are correct\nand are now being criticised for it. Well\nI believe that the ACC has been run\nsuperbly this year up to now, and the\ncriticism should be coupled with some\nconstructive analysis.\nThe current set-up requires clubs to\nfill in a budget, submit it to the ACC (or\nequivalent) who then make informed\ndecisions how much each club should\nbe granted, based purely on a spreadsheet of numbers from each treasurer.\nFirstly, we have a problem with clubs\ngetting wise to this set-up and in extreme circumstances budgets of tens\nof thousands of pounds are submitted;\nhence even a subsidy of just a few percent is substantial.\nSecondly, the ACC executive committee have to make decisions based\npurely on the incoming budget, but\noften there may be other contributing\nfactors. For example personal interest\nin certain clubs may result in biased\nbudgeting, and certain reputations of\nclubs may result in their budget being\ncut. Both of these circumstances are\nunfair and unprofessional. But that is\nwhere the problem is \u2013 we are not employing professionals. We are voting\nin volunteers (often from only a very\nsmall selection of people who are willing to do the job) who do not necessarily have any budgeting experience at\nall, yet we trust them to deal with the\ndistribution of substantial amounts of\nthe union\u2019s money. The DPCS could,\nand maybe should, have a bigger part\nto play in this after being provided with\ntraining\u2026 but it still comes down to\nopinionated students with little experience and vested interests.\nMy first idea is to make the budgeting system more scientific. I would bet\nthat everyone at IC can put together a\nspreadsheet that takes into account all\nthe facts and figures and will quickly\npop out a fair subsidy per head. Secondly why not get some financial advice in. I have been reliably informed\nthat the union has external financial\nadvisors. Why not use them?\nLastly, I think that clubs and societies need to be categorised, and hence\nfunded depending on an agreed status.\nLets say if I joined Knit Sock for exam-ple, I would not expect the \u00a350-\u00a3100\nsubsidy that most sports clubs receive,\nand further I do not think that riding\nand polo can be classed in the same\nleague of sports as rounders. The expenses of all these clubs are different\nand hence there needs to be some flexibility when assigning them money.\nICU pride\nthemselves on\nClubs & Socs\nJack Cornish\nSports Editor\nCorruption found\nwithin the ACC\nrequest, the ACC standard was 70%.\nBasketball have been underfunded too,\nand have suffered from successive poor\nsenior officers however have really improved this year, falling short of their\nmembership target by only one mem-ber. The target was also a lot higher\nthan previous years and is a medium-sized ACC club. Riding has gone from\nbeing a medium-small club to being a\nlarge ACC club.\u201d\nRiding and Polo is, as expected, an\nexpensive sport for individuals to take\npart in, especially with the costs of renting horses and having lessons. The argument that always exists is how much\nof that cost should the members pay?\nClubs which do not have such a high\nrunning cost, such as ICU and ICSM\nRugby, charge \u00a370 and \u00a360 respectively\nfor membership a year, which they use\nfor various travel costs, coaching and\ncompetition entry. IC Rugby, which\nnow has the biggest slice of the ACC\ncake, have had between \u00a3110 and \u00a3123\nper head over the last few years, or for\nevery pound membership they get between \u00a31.57 and \u00a32.47 back in subsidy,\nwith this years figure being \u00a31.57.\nOther more financially demanding\nsports, such as IC Boat Club charge\n\u00a375 membership to cover their ex-penses. On top of such a high membership fee, the members also have\nto pay to go to training and matches,\ncosting anything up to \u00a310 a week per\nplayer. Imperial College Hockey Club\nhave a similar set up, charging \u00a345 a\nhead, however, each individual has to\nbuy their own hockey stick and shoes,\nwhich can cost anything up to \u00a3280.\nIn contrast to the costs of these\nclubs, the Riding and Polo Club charge\ntheir members \u00a335 a year. With such\na low cost, it is not surprising that\n74 people signed up to the club to go\nhorse riding every week. Asked wether\nor not they would increase the membership fees to cover the high running\ncosts of the sport, Mr Furse replied\nN\not enough money and\nnot enough space. They\nare the two biggest\ncomplaints that you get\nfrom the 300 or so clubs\nand societies at Imperial. ICU has\nmore than any other students\u2019 union\nin the country and they are the best\nfunded, apparently. The facilities and\nservices available to the students are\nsecond to none, yet we still seem to\nhave problems, with clubs consistently\ncomplaining of not enough money or\nspace. What has the Union done, or are\nplanning on doing?\n\u201cI would say that money and space\nare the two biggest things that will always affect a club or society. Those are\nthe two things that will always affect\nclubs no matter what state the economy\nis in. It is an issue, and it will always be\nan issue.\n\u201d - Lily Topham\nWe continue our journey through\nthe pillars of university life. Social life\nand Clubs & Societies are almost in-terlinked; if you take part in a club or\nsociety you are bound to meet like-minded people and thus the bonds of\nfriendship develop. Take a look at the\nUnion on a Wednesday night, packed\nfull of sports teams all socialising and\nhaving a good time. But what happens\nwhen you\u2019re part of a club that fails to\nfunction properly, or, what could be\nseen as even worse, finds it hard to\nfunction properly because of financial\nconstraints?\nOne of the things that I do agree with\nLily is that running the ACC clubs is\nexpensive. \u201cIf we got rid of the ACC,\nthe financial problem here would be a\nlot easier, but that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d She went on to say that:\n\u201cThe SCC (Social Clubs Committee) has the largest number of clubs\nand they are by far the least funded out\nof all the CSCs at Imperial. They get\nabout \u00a34,000 a year whilst some clubs\nsuch, as the Boat Club are asking for\n\u00a36,000 in their appeal, which is more\nthan the whole of the SCC.\u201d\nSports clubs are expensive to run, but\ncould Sport Imperial maybe do more?\nIt seems that the Unions resources\nand finances are primarily used to\npromote and improve participation\nin the clubs. But what happens when\nthey are good and need more money\nto get better. Well that\u2019s where Sport\nImperial step in, however, it seems\nthat their level of involvement is incre-mental. Clubs such as the Boat Club,\nwho bring in more points than the rest\n\u201cNext year\u2019s budgeted membership fee\nis \u00a350 (up from \u00a335), with a target of\n65 members (same target as this year).\nMembers bear a huge cost for both riding and polo. The latter costs \u00a350ppph,\nthe former \u00a325ppph for flatwork,\n\u00a335ppph for jumping. The average\nmember spends around \u00a3500/year on\nriding (with subsidy), with members\nof the BUCS teams spending upwards\nof \u00a3800 (with subsidy). Regular polo\nplayers spend around \u00a31,400/year with\nsubsidy. The maximum subsidy any\none person could get in a year is \u00a3200,\nbut in practice this is rare.\u201d\nWhereas the Riding and Polo Club\nhave been meeting their membership\ntargets for the past few year, the other\nclubs in the spotlight have not. For the\npast four years, the Basketball club has\nfailed to reach their membership target which has meant that a percentage\nof the grant that was assigned to them\nhas always been lost. The amount\nlost has been as high as \u00a31,250 which\nwould then go into the ICU Exec reserves fund which is used for funding\nUnion projects. This money however,\ncould have been used to subsidise other clubs, so the decision to increase the\nbudget for a club that has not met it\u2019s\nmembership target for several years is\neven more puzzling to some club committee members.\nWhen asked about the suspicious\nincrease in the Basketball funds Mr\nFurse told felix that \u201cThe club has been\nthe victim of successive poor senior\nmanagement and has paid the price\nthrough budget cuts, but has turned\na corner this year and has more members than it has had for years. I am satisfied that the costs incurred have been\njustified for the grant allocated.\u201d\nOne problem that all Club and Societies Committees (CSC) have, including the ACC, is the lack of money and\nspace that is available to them. With so\nmany clubs and not enough money, it\nis always inevitable that some clubs will\nnot get what they ask for, the problem\nis that do the people who make the decisions make an impartial decision on\nwho should have a larger proportion\nof the cake? More importantly has the\nrelationship between the ACC Chair\nand Treasurer led to them both siding\nfavourably to each others clubs?\nWhen asked if there was enough\nmoney available to the ACC from ICU,\nMr Furse simply replied \u201cNo!\u201d. He went\non to explain that \u201cIt would be reasonable to request as much as \u00a3280-300k\nsubsidy for the ACC based on our\ncosts (the total cost is around \u00a31.25m\nincluding facilities) however it would\nbe unrealistic.\u201d\nThe problems continue even further\nfor Mr Furse with accusations of uneven distribution of funds within the\nRiding and Polo Club. Alex Sevell, Riding and Polo Treasurer, informed the\nUnion that he was not allowed to do\nthe budget for the club and that the\nsubmitted budget favoured the riding\nside quite heavily.\nMr Sevell told felix that \u201cthe Treasurer should play a big part in the bud-getting in any club. I did not feel I was\ngiven this opportunity, in fact after an\ninitial draft I felt actively excluded from\nthe process and my concerns about\nhow Riding and Polo were portrayed in\nthe proposal, seemingly downplaying\npolo significantly, were, as far as I can\ntell, either dismissed or ignored.\u201d\nChristian Carter, Imperial College\nUnion Deputy President (Finance &\nServices) told felix that the ACC budget allocations were \u201ctotally ridiculous\u201d\nand that \u201cwe will be dealing with budgets in the next CSB [Clubs and Societies Board] on the 26th May.\u201d\nSeveral questions arise from this\nwhole affair. Should the ACC consti-tution, or any CSC constitution, be\nchanged to not permit club chairs to\nstand for their governing body posi-tions? How much should individuals\ncontribute financially and how much\nshould the Union? Should the budgeting process be changed or inspected\nmore closely or, will the Union be too\nlazy to do anything about it? Or could\nit be, as this reporter thinks, that we\nhave too many clubs and that we actually can\u2019t fund all the clubs as fairly as\nthey would all like to be?\nBasketball and Riding & Polo societies have both received a\n\u00a32,000 grant increase from the Union for 2009-10.

A boat house, boats, Olympic gold medallists as coaches, the\nlist goes on! It seems that it will take\nsome time before another club will get\nthe same level of involvement as Boat,\nbut they do help along the way, all you\nneed to do is ask! Need money to get\nto a BUCS final? Ask them and they\nwill help. Need a physiotherapist for\nyour matches? Apply to the Developing Excellence Scheme and you might\nget one! It\u2019s that easy!\nSo yes, sports clubs are expensive to\nrun, but so are some of the outdoor\nclubs especially if you think of some of\nthe equipment they need, such as ca-noes! On one hand you really do have\nthe financial constraints that clubs\nhave, but they have it every year and\nthey seem to scrape through. The other problem is space.\nOutdoor sports need grounds on\nwhich they can play and Harlington\nis only one solution for the numerous outdoor clubs. Harlington is also\nfree for all those clubs and all they\nhave to pay are travel costs, which can\ncost anything up to \u00a320,000 a year per\nclub. The indoor ones, well they have\nEthos, which they have to pay for, but\nat least they don\u2019t have to pay for transport costs because it\u2019s right next to our\ncampus. Ethos, however, can only hold\nso many and so some clubs are going\nto have to travel farther afield. But the\nproblem doesn\u2019t seem to lie just with\nthe sports teams:\n\u201cCurrently, clubs can use College\nfacilities for their activities. But you\nhave two different types of facilities,\nthose that need a lot of space, such as\nthe sporting types, and then those that\nneed smaller meeting rooms. We definitely have enough space for meeting\nin, although the Union struggled with\nit this year,\u201d said Ms Topham.\nTo me, this seems that we are actually reaching a saturation point if you\nwill. We are running out of money to\ngive to the clubs, which can be seen by\nthe table on the opposite page where\nthe amount of money given per head\nhas decreased across the board, well\napart from the scandalous one! However it was something that Lily said\nthat confused me:\n\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a limit of sensible\nactivities that students can do, so we\nmight be reaching a limit in that sense.\nI think it\u2019s easy to look at room bookings and say that we\u2019re chocker block\nand that we\u2019ve got to a stage where we\ncan\u2019t sustain anymore. I think the Union just has to be more imaginative in\nthe way they accommodate them!\u201d\nTo me this says that we should be\nspending more money to create the\nspace for the clubs. Why are we not\ncurtailing the growth? If we don\u2019t have\nthe space, we slow down the rate at\nwhich we create new clubs and simply\ntry to optimise what we already have.\nRegarding the creation of new clubs,\nLily did say, and I agree with her on this\nas I\u2019ve been to a few of them (thought I\nmight as well do some proper investigation work!):\n\u201cI think that actually, at Imperial, we\ncan congratulate ourself on having so\nmany of clubs because its backed up\nby having such a high student partici-pation. We do actually quite severely\nscrutinise the new clubs before we put\nthem through to make sure they last\nand we make sure that we have enough\nresources to support them. At the same\ntime we do try and make sure that people\u2019s interests aren\u2019t ignored.\u201d\nPersonally I think that we do have\ntoo many clubs. It will be very difficult\nto get rid of a lot of them without any\nstrong evidence and trying to merge\nthem, no matter how easy it will make it\nto run them, might ultimately lead to a\nconflict of characters within the clubs.\nWhat I think really needs to be done is\na review. Let\u2019s have a look at the membership over the last few years, and if\nthey haven\u2019t reached their targets, then\nas Lily puts it \u201cthat\u2019s something that\nshould be taken into consideration at\nbudgeting for the next financial year\nreally!\u201d\nLet\u2019s also see how much the individuals have to put in to take part, which\nwill be very hard to do. With that infor-mation, we will be able to have a better\npicture of what the proper expenditures of the members and the clubs really are and we can make an informed\ndecision on the budgets.\nWe have so many successful clubs\nat Imperial who need a fair finance\nsystem to let them compete. We have\na very strong arts life at Imperial, we\nhave a strong and vibrant Dance soci-ety, we have a Big Band and sympho-nietta that win national competitions\nand sports teams that are the best in\nthe country.\nDoesn\u2019t the Union owe it to the successful clubs and societies to make\nsure that they don\u2019t go under during\nthis difficult time, or will they let them\nfall just to satisfy some smaller ones?\nHangman: ACC Chair and Treasurer in expenses claim.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n15\nFriday 15 May 2009 felix\nArts\nJust put a lady on top for a change\nCaz Knight is treated to illustrated versions of two great leaders at two recently opened exhibitions.\nI\nf ever you manage to read a\nproper newspaper and make it\nas far as the editorial and comment section deep in the back,\nnot far from the sports section,\nthen you will be familiar with the type\nof political cartoons currently on dis-playattworecentlyopenedexhibitions:\nYankee Doodles!: President Obama in\nCartoons at the Political Cartoon Gallery and Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! at\nthe Cartoon Museum. Both celebrate\nthe advent of leaders the U.S. and Britain had not seen before: a Black man\nand a woman.\nYankie Doodles is the first collection of original political cartoons of\nAmerica\u2019s 44th and first Black President and the last nine months have\ncertainly given political cartoonists\nsuch as Steve Bell, Dave Brown, Mark\nRowson, Ingram Pinn (to name but a\nfew) more than enough fodder for their\npictorial political satire.\nThis exhibition travels chronologically through Barack\u2019s rise through\nthe Democratic nominations, election\ncampaign and first few challenging\nmonths in office.\nOne takes for granted the skill of\nthese \u2018cartoonists\u2019 when one sees\ntheir work printed on newspaper. But\nframed and in all their watercolour glory one realizes just what a talent these\nmen have for creating a superb illustra-tion, injecting into it satire and comedy\nyet managing to maintain the political\ncontext and conveying a novel view-point. They are unafraid of offending\n(be that the politicians or the public),\nnot scared of pushing boundaries and\ncertainly not fearful of saying what we\nare thinking but too shy to say.\nAs one browses through the car-toons, themes begin to emerge and a\nbroader picture is painted which reflects the many facets of public and\nmedia perceptions of Obama and how\nhe has dealt with the obstacles presented to him these last nine months. Dave\nBrown of the Independent\u2019s Barack is\ndecidedly gremlin like with pointed\nears and taking on the form of a hur-ricaine as John McCain\u2019s defeat looms\nahead, while the Financial Times\u2019 Ingram Pinn\u2019s Obama is nothing short\nof heroic and handsome, lacking the\nengorged horse teeth \u2013 a common feature of many of the other caricatures.\nThese cartoons will have you laugh\nout loud especially at Peter Schrank\u2019s\nimage featuring a down and out, alcoholic bum Uncle Sam proclaiming\nexcitedly, \u201cGuess what, they\u2019re fighting\nPride, Prejudice and a huge mirror\nOne is great and one is gruesome: Emily Wilson reports back on two exhibitions currently showing at the\nNational Portrait Gallery\nU\nsually when I write reviews for the arts pages\nof Felix I\u2019m reviewing\nexhibitions I would pay\nto see anyway, featuring\nartists I already know and love. This\nsomewhat defeats the point of writing\na review, given that I\u2019m inevitably going to fill it with praise and admiration,\nwith a few token whinges near the end\nto balance it. This week I saw two exhibitions that I wouldn\u2019t normally have\nset foot in: Constable\u2019s portraits and\nthe photography of Gerhard Richter at\nthe National Portrait Gallery. I was expecting to be moderately unimpressed\nby both. But contrary to my expecta-tions, I thoroughly enjoyed the former\nbut completely despised the latter.\nJohn Constable (1776-1837) is know\nfor being a nice traditional English\nlandscape artist. Rolling hills, country\nfolk, mills... that sort of thing. But here\nwe have the portraits Constable pro-duced. The focus is on his nearest and\ndearest. His father, brother and sisters,\nwife and seven children are all present,\npainted with deep fondness. There\u2019s a\ntenderness that comes through, particularly when he paints his younger\nsister and his children, that only appears when the subject is captured by\nthe person who knows them best. For\na \u2018landscape artist\u2019, Constable is incredibly talented as a portrait painter.\nThese aren\u2019t just sketches to hang on\nthe family\u2019s mantelpiece \u2013 Constable\nalso painted portraits of the rich and\nfamous to support his seven children.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see the family resemblance between the Constables.\nThere are self portraits of John, which\nshow a similarity to his rather attractive brother Abram, who in turn looks\nlike their sister Mary. All can also be\ncompared back to their father, who features twice here. Mary is a very pretty,\npale-skinned, dark-eyed girl in the\nJane Austen style \u2013 cape on, bonnet at\nhand. The whole exhibition oozes Jane\nAusten, with a hint of stately home\ntour.\nThe exhibition is a pleasing contrast\nto what I had expected: mild pae-dophilia of rosy-cheeked, doe-eyed\nteenage girls. There is a little bit of\nrosy-cheekedness dotted about in the\nportraits of family friends. \u201cMaster\nCrosby\u201d (1808) is horrendously twee\nand over-angelic. \u201cThe Barker Children\u201d (1809) is described as \u201cthe most\npolished and successful of Constable\u2019s\ngroup portraits\u201d, but I think is the\nworst thing in the whole exhibition. It\u2019s\npainfully naff, with small boys in white\nfrocks.\nThe underlying Austenian love story\nis the romance that blossoms between\nover me\u201d, as Obama and McCain battle\nit out in the election.\nThe recurring theme of the President as Messiah presents itself in many\nforms, most comically when he is\nunable to get into the bath - \u201cShucks\nMichelle, I can walk on it but I can\u2019t\nget in!\u201d Other highlights include a\npig-tailed Bill Clinton dressed a cheer-leader, Sarah Palin riding a giant lipstick brandishing a rifle and Obama\nthreatening to shoot his new puppy Bo\n(\u201cKeep spending or the puppy gets it.\u201d)\nAt their less brilliant these cartoons\nincite a titter; at their best they are in-genious. One comes away learning a\nhuge deal about the current affairs that\nhave come to pass, the media\u2019s portrayal of them and how these satirists have\nplayed on.\nThese cartoons will be treasured in\nyears to come as well as being studied\nas sources during GCSE history classes\nin fifty years. I wonder if they will be\nenjoyed and appreciated as much as\nthey are now? Until 13 June.\nTen minutes away Maggie! Maggie!\nMaggie! celebrates thirty years since\nthe Iron Lady came to power on 4 May\n1979. Those not old enough to have\nlived through the Thatcher age consciously might not immediately understand many of the hundred odd cartoons on display, which feature works\nfrom over 35 artists such as Martin\nRowson, Steve Bell and Gerald Scarfe.\nHowever, curator Anita O\u2019Brien has\nensured that each piece is accompanied by a brief but informative blurb,\nputting each picture in context and\nallowing none of the satire to go to\nwaste.\nMargaret Thatcher suffered much\nmore ambivalence than Obama. Not\nonly did she appear bourgeois when\ncompared to England\u2019s working class\nmajority. But she was a woman, and it\nwas the seventies. These cartoons explore her rise to power, the Falkland\u2019s\nwar, the miner\u2019s strikes, her policies\nsuch as privitization, deregulation, tax\ncuts and strong defence, her downfall\nand the impact the Thatcher era has\nhad on Britain.\nMany of the cartoons show her as a\nlady wrought of iron in temperament,\nin cutting rhetoric and in inexorable\nbeliefs: \u201cYou turn if you want to. The\nlady\u2019s not for turning.\u201d\nWe are treated to many more of\nMaggie\u2019s razor sharp lines in a picture\nentitled Mrs Thatcher\u2019s Pearls which\nseeks to reinforce her sheltered middle class background. Others include\nan excellent abstract and visceral portrait by Ralph Steadman (illustrator to\nHunter S. Thompson\u2019s Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas), commissioned by the\nLabour party, filled with his characteristic blots and splatters of ink. Erratic\nfootballer George Best features in a\ncartoon produced during Thatcher\u2019s\ntime as Secretary of State for Education and Science with the birds, booze\nand fast cars lover sucking his thumb\nin a nursery.\nMany of these political cartoons\ncould be construed as misogynistic,\nespecially in this age of political cor-rectness. Labour supporting feminists\nof the time might have had difficulty\ndeciding which side to back: their party or their sex. It is a sign of Thatcher\u2019s\npower and presence that cartoonists who opposed her had no qualms\nabout attacking her using any means\npossible.\nGiven the seemingly unanimous\nBritish contempt for Maggie in today\u2019s\nLabour climate, this exhibition manages to present both sides of Britain\u2019s first\nfemale PM impartially and it is possible to come away feeling sympathy\nand admiration for this strong leader\nwho advocated self improvement and\npersonal responsibility and who went\na long way in reversing the economic\ndecline of the nation. There is much\nto learn and be entertained by here.\nEnsure that you have plenty of time to\nperuse.\nUntil 26 July.\nConstable and his eventual wife Maria\nBicknell. Bicknell\u2019s parents disapprove\nof her possibly marrying an artist, and\nhe only dares pursue her after nabbing\na tidy inheritance. Then after some\nhoneymooning in a cottage they have\nseven children before she tragically\ndies in 1828. The portraits of Maria\nBicknell are some of the nicest paintings here, particularly where she is\npictured with some of her children.\nAnother particular favourite is \u201cEmily\non a sofa\u201d (1834), an ink sketch of Constable\u2019s nine year old daughter lazily\nreclining with a book.\nThe exhibition does end on a bit of\na low, extending beyond Constable\u2019s\nfamily and into some rich people who\npaid him to paint them. There\u2019s less of\na narrative here, and less to catch your\ninterest. Though I must admit to being very taken with \u201cSir Richard Digby\nNeave\u201d, who was a VERY attractive\nyoung gentleman. I can quite imagine\nhim on horseback, galloping up to me\non a hillside, with me in a bonnet and\nempire line dress... Overall this exhibition is short and sweet, very relaxing\nto wander round, though best suited\nto those of us who enjoy BBC costume\ndramas and National Trust properties.\nOn the other end of the spectrum is\nGerhard Richter. Here we have some\nvery modern photography. Given that\nI have very little patience with photog-raphy, and plenty of modern art fails to\nappeal to me at all, it is probably unsurprising that I hated this exhibition.\nI only spent around ten minutes in it,\nhaving not really intended to go at all,\nand couldn\u2019t stand to stay any longer.\nHere Gerhard Richter has taken some\nphotographs, or in some cases I believe\njust stolen other people\u2019s photographs,\nand made them large and blurry. That\nis it. Some involve naked women with\nunattractively shaped breasts, most are\njust people standing doing not a lot.\nThe works are hung in a very white,\nvery bright gallery in such a way that\ngives me a headache, and makes my\nmild hangover significantly less mild.\nIt was quite crowded when I went in,\nwhich bewilders me because I cannot\nfind anything to like about Richter\u2019s\nblurry photography.\nWhat makes me even more angry is\nthe final piece in the gallery which is\n\u201cSpiegel [Mirror]\u201d (2008). It is a mir-ror. Really. It\u2019s quite big, but it\u2019s just a\nplain flat mirror. I usually hold a lot\nmore patience for modern art and all\nits ridiculous eccentricities than your\naverage person, but this is stupid. Unless you are particularly passionate\nabout Richter (why? No really, I\u2019d like\nto know) or a massive photography\nfan, I would urge you to avoid this exhibition like the plague. There are lots\nof lovely things to see for free in the\nNPG without spending your precious\nstudent loan on this nonsense, so don\u2019t\neven give it a second thought.\nConstable is on until 31 May and\nRichter until 14 June 2009.\nConstable\u2019s wife Maria Bicknell\nTwo of Constable\u2019s daughters\n\n"

In\nthe first ever kind of large-scale study\nof its kind, epidemiologists from Liverpool and Warwick universities aim to\nfind out, but they need our help.\nThey are asking for volunteers to\ncomplete an online survey, detailing\nhow many people we come into contact with on a specific day (if you are an\naverage student, that\u2019s probably quite a\nlot!) \u2013 and, crucially, they also need to\nknow how many of those we actually\ntouched (!) giving details about when\nand where the contacts occurred.\nIt might seem a little bit \u2018big brother\u2019\nbut all the info submitted is confiden-tial, and using this data, they will for\nthe first time, be able to make a detailed \u2018map\u2019 of person-person exchanges in the UK.\n\u201cWe need to know the patterns of\nsocial interactions to enable us to bet-Maria Hogan\nScience Correspondent\nA\nteam of Imperial students is focusing their\nwork on solar energy. A\nteam of third and fourth\nyear students from the\nMechanical Engineering Department\nhave been designing a solar panelled\nboat for green boat races. Their work\non the solar boat counts towards their\nthird and fourth year research projects.\nThe boat, \u2018Solar Spirit\u2019 is made of glass\nfibre and is powered by five solar panels which drive an electric outboard\nmotor. The motor runs on lead-acid\nbatteries which maximise cost efficiency and create a power storage system\nthat is within the competition\u2019s storage\ncapacity and weight limits. It is partly\nsponsored by the Mechanical Engineering Department.\nThe prototype of the \u2018Solar Spirit\u2019\nfirst hit the water back in June 2007\nwhen it was tested and found to be\nfully functional and running at speeds\nof 6.3mph. In their first race in 2008\nthey came 14th out of 21 solar boats:\nthis unsatisfying result was due to inexperience and bad luck: the electronics on boat stopped working in the last\n500m of the 220km race! So the team\nreceived the \u201cBad Luck Prize\u201d from the\njudges. But they are now gearing up for\nthe 2010 Frisian Solar Challenge \u2013 Europe\u2019s only solar boat race that takes\nplace in Netherlands where they hope\nto get a better result.\nHow many people are on the\nteam?\nWe currently have one team of four\nthird year undergraduates working\ndirectly on the boat, and a couple of\nfourth years doing related individual\nprojects. We hope to be able to extend the project slightly for next year\n(hopefully to two or three third year\nprojects, each of four or five third\nyears). There might also be opportunities for more fourth years to get inImperial\u2019s Solar Powered Boats\nvolved. (If any mechanical engineers\n- particularly second years - are interested in doing the project next year\nthen they can e-mail the team)\nIs it an official part of your\ncourse-do you get any credits for\nit?\nYes, a significant part of the third\nyear of the mechanical engineering\ncourse is the group Design, Make and\nTest (DMT) project, worth around a\nthird of the marks for the year. A Solar Spirit project can easily be used as\none of these projects - for example to\ndesign, make and test a suitable hull.\nThe fourth year has a similar amount\nof marks allocated to an individual\nproject, which is typically more re-search/development based. There are\nplenty of things in the Solar Spirit\nproject which would fit such research\nprojects, particularly given Imperial\u2019s\nrelative inexperience with boats!\nWhy did you focus on solar boats\nand not solar cars like many other\nuniverisites have done (UCL,\nCambridge...)?\nOne thing you\u2019ll notice about the\nMechanical Engineering Department\nis that it already has two large car\nprojects - Formula Student and Racing\nGreen [and now a third one, Racing\nGreen Endurance]. We wanted to do\nsomething else, and while Imperial\u2019s\nlimited experience of boat hydrodynamics has been a big challenge, it is\nin a way a better learning experience\nfor the students to have to go out and\nfind out about, say, hull shape design\nrather than just being able to get all\nthe answers easily.\nWhat is the point of these boats -are they ever mean to be commercialized or is just for pushing\nthe solar technology further?\nThe short term vision for the project\nis simply to provide an interesting and\nstimulating project to undergraduates.\nLong term it is unlikely that any work\nwe do will directly benefit the wider\nworld, simply because it is just an undergraduate project and by its nature\nthere is very little original research\nthat can be done on such a project.\nHowever, despite this, I see the project\nas a vital part of the Mechanical Engineering Department because of two\nreasons. Firstly it is a challenging,\nexciting and stimulating project (and\nI speak from personal experience!)\nwhich helps the students to develop\ntheir skills (both direct engineering\nskills and general skills such as team-work) to the highest level. Secondly it\npromotes solar power and renewable\ntechnologies to the upcoming generation of engineers, which I see as vital\nto the future. By providing the future\nengineers with such attributes, hopefully we can benefit the world just as\nmuch as if we set up a high level solar\ncell research lab!\nWhat is you view of renewable\nenergy and solar power?\nI think it\u2019s clear to everyone that solar power - in its current form - is unlikely to be able to make a large scale\ncontribution to UK energy produc-tion. The technology isn\u2019t particularly\nnew, and yet even these days the outputs are typically too low in comparison to costs for it to be commercially\nsuccessful. Having said this, what is\nvital is that we innovate, invent and\npush the boundaries, and one of the\nfields we can do this in is solar power.\nBy its very nature we don\u2019t know what\nthe next great invention\u2019s going to be,\nbut if we push ourselves in the right\nway then we might just come up with\na new fantastically efficient way of\ncapturing sunlight and turning it into\nelectricity. Or it could be in the field\nof wind power. Or it could be a whole\nnew source of energy that no-one\u2019s\nthought of before. What is important\nis that we are not afraid to go out and\ntry new things.\nHow do you see future in terms of\nfelix talks to Peter Huthwaite, a member of Imperial\u2019s student solar boat racing team Solar Spirit.\nCould students help stop the spread of the pandemic?\nter predict and control the spread of\ninfections \u2013 such as pandemic flu,\u201d said\nProfessor Keeling, one of the lead researchers in the project.\n\u201cThere are understandable growing\nconcerns about the current situation\nand a possible pandemic; we need to\nfind out as much as possible about social contacts\u201d.\nIn light of the current Swine flu epidemic therefore, leading figures such\nas Professor Stephen Hawking, record-breaking runner David Moorcroft and\ntelevision historian and writer Adam\nHart-Davis are appealing for as many\npeople as possible to complete the survey \u2013 and for as many days as possible.\n\u201cFrom the results we will have a much\nbetter idea of how quickly an epidemic\ncould spread, and the measures that\nwould be needed to control it,\u201d said Dr\nRead of Liverpool University.\nFor further details, or to complete\nthe survey online, log on to www.con-tactsurvey.org\nWind powered Lotus Exige.\nRead felix on the\nnew Kindle DX?\nThe new Amazon\u2019s digital newspapers reader, Kindle DX announced\nlast week is hailed to save the newspa-pers. The new, larger Kindle (9.8 inch\nscreen) was revealed in New York last\nweek and will go on sale for $489 in the\nsummer.\nWith readers flocking to read news\nonline, number of people buying has\nbeen in decline as well as the newspaper revenues from advertising in print.\nKindle and similar digital readers\nthat allow books and newspapers to\nbe delivered digitally and read on the\nscreen, could save costs of printing and\nprovide revenue through subscription\nto the newspapers.\nThree US newspapers, The New\nMico Tatalovic\nScience Editor\nYork Times, The Boston Globe and The\nWashington Post have already signed\ndeals to deliver their content via Kindle.\nOthers, like USA Today have signed\ndeals with the British equivalent, the\nPlastic Logic, to use their third generation digital readers.\nBut will felix be available to read\nthrough Kindle? Jovan Nedi\u0107, the editor of felix says \u201che will look into anything that would make the newspapers\nwebsite available to more people\u201d. He\ndoesn\u2019t exclude the possibility of felix\nappearing as one of the available newspapers on Kindle. With the ongoing\nwork to digitise the entire felix archive\nand make it available in user-friendly\nway to readers, it is possible that felix\nwill soon make the next logical step\nand become available on Kindle-like\ndevices.\nIssue 12 \u2022 Summer 2009 - OUT NOW!\nScratch & Sniff front cover!!!\nFocus: green\nenergy ALSO: Proust Phenomenon, Solar\nCars & London\u2019s Wild Parrots\nI, science\nO\nUT\nM\nO\nNDAY\nenergy sources?\nIt is impossible to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but it is\nclear today that the traditional methods of energy production are becoming unsuitable because of limited resources and waste products. What is\nvital is innovation and investigation\n(which as I mentioned before are a key\npart of the Solar Spirit project) which\nwill help us develop new technologies\n- whatever they are - in the future. It is\nclear that things are going to have to\nchange, and the sooner we act on this\nthe better things will be for everyone.\nIt would be wise for the world to\ninvest in a variety of technologies (in-cluding outside the field of renewa-bles) because things do change and a\nhaving a wide range of resources to\nrely on will make us more resilient to\nfuture problems.\n\n"
