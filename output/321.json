Taking the national dailies and\nSundays as examples, critics both state and believe\nthat the Editor, having dictated his policy to his staff,\ninvariably alters every article to suit his own political\nor other doctrines; or, should this be impossible, either\nleaves out the article altogether or reduces it to trivia\nby judicious use of accompanying matter and headings\nor snide editorial comments, or by placing the article\nin an entirely incongruous position.\nIn the case of national\nnewspapers, it is true that\nsuch policy is actively\npursued. After all, the\njournalists are paid to\nfollow the Editorial line.\nThe primary object of\nnational newspapers is to\nmake money. No businessman sinks millions of\npounds in a newspaper\njust for the sheer hell of\nit. In order to keep any\npaper going, advertising is\nnecessary, and a lot of it;\nto get a lot of advertising,\nthe publisher has to sell a lot of copies to the sort of\npeople the advertisers\nwant to sell to. The editorial content is adjusted\naccording to the sort of\nreadership the advertisers\nwant. The spectrum of\nstyle and political thought\nof newspapers is as wide\nas the spectrum of advertising markets.\nTake an example. A very useful market for\nmany advertisers is the\nmature businessman or\nprofessional man and his\nwife, who can afford to\nenjoy their creature com-forts, and own a nice\nbungalow in a good residential district. Quite a number of them are probably retired officers from\nthe services. These people\nform the majority of the\nbuyers of expensive cars,\nfurniture, spirits, etc.; the\n\"Style Goods\". By sheer\ncoincidence, these people\njust happen, in general, to\nbe dyed a deep blue, are\nquite reactionary, go to\nthe opera, go to the races,\nand are strong believers\nin the Empire. Do you\nbegin to recognise the\nleanings of the Daily T.? So certainly in the case\nof the nationals the Editor dictates the policy and\nensures that every article\npublished conforms with\nit. This policy is in turn\ndictated by the advertisers. If there were a number of advert is able products that appealed\nespecially to Buddhists\nliving in Scarborough\nand voting Communist, it\nwould not be long before\nthe \"Scarborough Buddhist Morning Star\"\nappeared on the news-stands.\nThis is not the case\nwith student newspapers.\nOnly one of them in\nBritain is just about self-supporting through advertising Sennet), and even\nhere the advertisers just\nwant to advertise to students \u2014\u2022 not any particular sect of them. So there\nis no reason why \"there\nshould be hard and fast\neditorial policy in student\nnewspapers. After all, the\npurpose of student papers\nis to inform and entertain\nstudents \u2014 not to indoctrinate them.\nThe life blood of a student newspaper is not its\nEditor. It is its staff, the\npeople who give up their\nfree time to go to meet-in gs, interview people, do\nbackground research, and\nwrite articles about it all.\nThe people who spend\ntheir free, time designing\npage layouts. The people\nwho come and polish up\nother people's contributions, and make them literate and fit the space\navailable. The people who\nContinued on Page 7\nTHALIDOMIDE,\nand why we should\nboycott Distillers9\nThe drug \"Disteval\", otherwise known as Thalidomide, was withdrawn from the open market in\n1961 on account of its danger to human life. The\npast decade has been characterised by .legal Impasse in the Courts and staid acquiescence on the\npart of the drug distributors. Distillers' Company\n{Biochemicalsf Ltd., with the result that Thalidomide victims have received little or no recompense. In 1968 62 of the 430 Thalidomide victims\nagreed to a settlement of 40 per cent, of what they\nmight have expected amounting to \u00a316,200 per\nchild.\nLAST YEAR DCL GROUP PROFITS WERE\n\u00a364 MILLION.\nWhy do DCL refuse to face up to their responsibility in this matter, when in a recent poll of some\nof their shareholders, 70 per cent, thought the\noffered compensation inadequate?\nWhy have they tried to silence public debate on\nthe matter by legal action against the Sunday\nTimes, and why, if the Court is truly concerned\nwith \"the public interest\" did it not consider the\nvoracity of the articles in question?\nIt should not be the Government's job to meet\nthe obligations of DCL.\nAre DCL worthy of your continued custom?\nCome to the Union Meeting this Tuesday.\nVote to boycott Distillers' products.\nA Letter FROM\nthe Editor\nDear Readers,\nIt seems that lots of people are still not managing to find me, and have curious ideas as to my\"\nwhereabouts. Well, since I have to go out to see\nadvertisers, agents and on other necessary Felix\nbusiness, all of which has to be done during office\nhours, it means I am out fairly frequently. Therefore, by popular request, I am instituting \"Office\nHours\". Unfortunately I can't promise to stick to\nthem, but I 'll do my best (and it's certain that I 'll\nbe there at other times too).\nHere goes :\nMONDAY\nTUESDAY\nWEDNESDAY\nTHURSDAY\nFRIDAY\nSATURDAY\nSUNDAY\n-0830--0600--0830--0830--1100\n-1200\n-1200;\n-1100;\n-0830\u20141100;\n-Closed\n-0900\u20141200;\n1230\u20141500\n1530\u20142100\n1 530\u20142000\n1300\u20142100\nIt also seems that people are STILL trying to ring\nme on Internal 2881. If you want to know why I never answer, well, it's 'cos the phone isn't con-nec ted! Ring PG extension 2229, which IS con-nec ted. Love,\nOLLY\nMugging, Big Dogs\nand Twelve Foot\nTools\nEvening Standard headline . . . \"Mugging\nis on the Increase, says J.P.\" The popular press has a peculiar knack of\nseizing on to some minor new trend or incident which it considers to be anti-society\nand giving it high prominence. A major section\nof the public, knowing no better, duly respond.\nSeveral Conservative M.P.s duly respond. The\nprominence is maintained until the next bit of\ntrivia comes along.\nSo mugging is on the increase. Well, of\ncourse it is. The word only came into vogue\nrecently so it had a zero rating Just a few\nmonths ago. Since then almost every single\nform of violence and direct theft has progressively become classified as mugging.\nCertain sections of the community often\nfigure in these onslaughts. Much destructive\ncriticism is dissipated on youth; bestiality is\noften condemned by newspapers owned by\nold men who are too old to enjoy it or younger\nmen who sell their papers by obsessively highlighting it. Particular fringe sections \u2014 stu-dents, rock groups etc. \u2014 who exist outside\nthe accepted day's work, day's pay, marry the\ngirl/boy who you dropped/dropped you in the\nclub who lives in the next street, think like\ndad/mum syndrome come in for special treat-ment.\nIt doesn't even have to be people engaging\neveryone's attention. If you were to search\nthrough the past ten years of newspapers one\nbathe tic press occurred about April last year\nwhen all the Alsatians in the country were apparently conducting a vigorous terrorist campaign against small children. (No doubt, if\nthis were to be repeated now we would see\nheadlines like \"Another Dog Baby-mugging\nin Fulham\".) Looking through that 10 years of\npress offerings would also put events into perspective and probably only a handful of headlines would be at all relevant to the history\nof the period.\nIt would also show the way certain words\nand expressions come in and out of fashion.\nRecent in-vogue terms are \"chauvinist\",\ncredibility\", \"juggernauts\" and \"en v iron ment\"; before that \"viable\" and \"pragmatism\". New words and expressions spring up\nthough these usually appear in non-establish-ment publications since new is deemed equivalent to unconventional:\u2014\n\"Like, man, it's too much. Got any\nstraights, man. Got the skins and grass, man\nWow, feel real heavy. Pass me some bread,\nman. Must score a Wimpy\" OR\n\"Jeez, Sheelagh. Must go choke a Darkie be\nfore I part the Tiger all over the Ferrett\" OR\n\"Bag of Spam' 'etc.\nJust as the written and spoken word\nchanges so other visual forms of com mu nica lion alter \u2014 new art forms, advertising gim-rick ry, graf it ti etc. Drawing highly decorative,\ndisproportion ed male organs seems to have\nreached epidemic poular it y in the Monastic\nsanctuary of IC in recent years and the guys\nwho drew a twelve foot tool for ail to see from\nCollege block certainly knew the quickest way\nof getting a response from the College.\nI just pity the guy Who cleaned it all off.\nThat's penile servitude for you!\nThe Laudsnapper $\n\n"

Phosphorous\nbounced around chattering aimlessly.\n\"Gosh, Ferocious, isn't this wonderful?\nI 've never been on an adventure before,\nunless you count getting on the wrong train\nlast week and going to Glasgow instead of\nCricklewood. That was more surprising than\nadventurous, I suppose. But this is quite\ndifferent to Glasgow \u2014 I mean the trees and\nthe sand and all that. And there don't seem\nto be any Scotsmen round here, which there\nare in Glasgow of course. Ha, Ha, . . . \"\nPhosphorous' voice died away when he saw\nthe look on Ferocious' face.\n\"Do shut up, dear boy\".\n\"I'm sorry, Ferocious, but it's so ex c it ing\".\n\"Doubtless for you, dear lad, it is. I am\nmore concerned for my humble abode, and\nits exact whereabouts, as of this moment\".\n\"I know it is worrying for you, but this is\na real Adventure, and we must do something adventurous. Perhaps?\" Phosphorous\nadded, as he saw Ferocious beginning to\nlook more irritated than usual.\n\"Just what do you suggest, my impatient\nchum?\" inquired Ferocious.\n\"Well, urn\", went Phosphorous, glancing\naround. Suddenly something in the distance\ncaught his eye. \"Look Ferocious, look at\nthat\", he pointed to a hut-like object in the\nfar distance. \"Let's go and see what that\nis\".\n\"It is I suppose, marginally preferable to\nsitting here pondering\", said Ferocious,\n\"Let us proceed in that direction\".\nSo the two friends set off along the beach.\nFerocious strode languidly over the sand, as\nPhosphorous trotted on ahead \u2014 stopping\nevery now and then to wait for his friend.\nThe sun was high in the sky and the sand\nsoft under foot, as the intrepid adventurers\ntrudged along. Even Ferocious' long legs\nwere beginning to tire as the distant hut\nbecame less so. By now Phosphorous and\nFerocious could see that the hut was on\nwheels \u2014 it was obviously a converted\nbathing hut. Peeling pink paint decorated its\nsun-bleached timbers, and over the door\nhung a large sign:\n\"MOBILE ADVENTURE RECEPTION\nCENTRE. Knock and enter\".\n\"Oh look, Ferocious\", said Phosphorous,\n\"what shall we do?\"\n\"We could try knocking, and even perhaps entering\", replied Din, drily.\n\"Tremendous\", said Phosphorous. So\nthey knocked and entered.\nInside the hut sat an elderly man, behind\na large mahogany desk. Little tufts of hair\nsprouted from his cheekbones, and he wore\na high wing collar. His fingers, long bony\nand ink-stained, gripped a quill pen with\nwhich he was writing industriously in an\nold ledger. He did not look up when the two\nfriends came in.\n\"Ahem!\" coughed Ferocious politely \u2014\nthere was no reaction. \"Ahem\", he coughed\nagain \u2014 still there was no sign that the\nman had noticed them. Phosphorous was\njust drawing breath to join his friend in a little polite throat clearing, when a small\npiece of fluff which happened to be passing\nwas sucked in on the draught.\n\"Cough, splutter, choke, wheeze\", went\nPhosphorous as politely as he could in the\ncircumstances. He clasped his throat,\ncoughing and spluttering, and staggered\nabout the little hut banging into walls,\nslowly turning purple.\n\"I say, dear boy, that's going a little far,\ndon't you think?\" said Ferocious.\n\"Spit, writhe\", went Phosphorous, as the\nfluff finally exploded from his throat.\n\"Sorry\", he said.\n\"Can I help you?\" inquired the old man,\nseemingly unaffected by Phosphorous'\nbreathing troubles.\n\" Ah\", said Ferocious Din, \"May I introduce Phosphorous the Jobrot. and I, my-self, am Ferocious Din\".\n\"Hello\", said Phosphorous.\n\"Grunt\", said the man.\n\" We\", went on Ferocious, \"are supposed\nto be on an adventure, if you'll excuse the\nterm, and seeing the most explicit sign over\nyour door, we felt that you might be able\nto \u2014 ah \u2014 furnish us with some assistance\n\u2014 so to speak\".\n\"Well, you have, as it happens, come to\nthe right place\", said the man, whose name\nwas Mr. Drains, \"but I must say they are\nsending us a very different class of adventurer nowadays\".\n\" Eh?\" said Phosphorous, suspecting an\ninsult.\n\"Why I can remember the days\", went\non Mr. Drains, \"when your adventurers were\nreal gentlemen, as would have gold watches,\nand fine clothes. Y3s people knew their\nplace in them days \u2014 oh yes\".\n\" My dear wizened old idiot\", said Ferocious, \"nostalgia is all very fine in its place,\nand it's certainly not what it used to be,\nbut: this is not really helping with our ad-venture\".\n\"Typical\", grunted Mr. Drains, \"however,\nI am obliged to set you off on your ad ven ture. Let me see now\". Turning from his\ndesk, the old man pulled open a vast filing\ncabinet which stood at the back of the hut.\n\"Din F. and Jobrot P, the.\" he muttered,\nflicking through piles of documents. \" Ah, here we are \u2014 Ferocious Din and Phosphorous the Jobrot: the adventure of the\nTiny Twigworm\". Ferocious' eyes lit up.\nSince the death of Tonsil he had been looking for a new worm. \"Here you are\",\nsnapped Mr. Drains, handing Ferocious a long, sealed envelope, \"read it outside\nwould you, we're very busy at the moment\".\n\"Thank you for making us feel so much\nat home\", said Ferocious, taking the en ve lope, and smiling offensively at Mr. Drains.\n\"Young people got no manners nowadays,\nit was different when I was a lad, why for\none penny . . .\"\nBut Ferocious and Phosphorous had left\nthe Mobile Adventure Reception Centre, and\nwalked a little way back down the beach.\nThey sat down on a convenient sandy hummock and Ferocious slit open the envelope.\nInside was a long, folded piece of paper\nwith an official looking crest at the top.\nFerocious unfolded the paper and began to\nread:\nADVENTURE OF THE TINY TWIGWORM\n\"Summary of situation so far. Two weeks\nago there was a severe storm in the area\nof the Permanent Adventure Centre, and the\nTiny Twigworm was found washed up on\nthe beach. When he had recovered sufficiently, he told us that he had been swept\noverboard from the Twigwormery where he\nlived, and remembered little more until he\nwoke up at the Centre. Twigwormeries are\nthe floating nest or group of nests on which\nthe Twigworms travel the Oceans of the\nworld. (\"Gosh\" said Phosphorous). The Tiny\nTwigworm is, of course anxious to rejoin\nits Twigwormery, and its presence in the\nCentre has become something of a problem.\nIt is with this situation in mind that Ferocious Din and Phosphorous the Jobrot are\ninvited to remove the Twigworm and return him to his home. Each Adventurer\nis entitled to one piece of Amazing Equipment. You will therefore call at the Adventure Equipment Stores, Back of the dunes,\n3rd Palm Tree on the Left, before starting\nthe adventure. GOOD LUCK!\"\n\" A concise if not very informative do cu ment\" said Ferocious, shaking the envelope\nto see if there was any money stuck inside.\nThere was not.\n\"Ooh, ooh, it's really starting\", squeaked\nPhosphorous, \"come on Ferocious, let's get\non\".\n\"All in good time, dear boy\". Quoth the\nwily- Din. but Phosphorous could wait no\nlonger. Leaping to his feet, he rushed off\ndown the beach.\n\"You are going the wrong way, dear old\nimpetuous buddy', shouted Ferocious. Phosphorous skidded to a halt in a cloud of\nsand and came back. \" On the left, it says.\nBack of the Dunes, Third Palm Tree on the\nLeft\" explained Ferocious.\n\" Oh\", said Phosphorous.\n\"Follow Ferocious Din, navigator extra-ordinary\", said Ferocious walking into a palm tree. He was not seriously injured, and\nreplacing his monocle, set off for the Back\nof the Dunes, with Phosphorous trailing\nalong behind.\nThe two friends had hardly passed the\nline of palm trees at the back of the beach,\nwhen there could be seen the Adventure\nStores ahead of them. The \"Stores\" was a yellow-painted Nisson hut with a large sign\nover the door which read: \"Adventure\nStores. Prop. A. Drawers. Licensed to sell\nAmazing Equipment and That\".\n\"This seems to be the place\", said Ferocious, and in they went.\nA wooden counter divided off the main\narea of the Stores from the little bit by the\ndoor. Behind the counter stood row upon\nrow of shelves draped with mysterious ob-j ect s. Piles of THINGS littered the floor\nand yet more weird devices hung from the\nceiling. There was no-one to be seen.\n\"Er. shop?\" said Ferocious, a little ner-vous ly. From behind one of the piles of\nTHINGS emerged a stooping figure, coughing like a lung full of gravel.\n\"Yus, mate\", he croaked \u2014- and the cigarette in the corner of his mouth trembled\nas he spoke \u2014 \"what can I do you for?\"\n\"I am Ferocious Din, and this is Phosphorous the Jobrot\" announced Ferocious, \"and\nwe are. ah, adventurers so to speak, and we\nclaim our Amazing Equipment\".\n\"Well, you come to the right place, 'ent\nyou\" replied the man, \"I am Alf Drawers\nand this here is your Adventure Stores. I 'll\njust look in me book and see what won pot-?\".\nFrom under the counter Alf drew out a A book in\n9 parts\nby S. Swailes\nPART TWO\nlarge, well-thumbed book. Slowly turning the\npages, he ran an oily thumb down the inky\ncolumns.\n'\"Ere we are\", he said, digging a nico-tine-stained digit into the page, \"You gets\nthe Partially Invisible Gumboots and the\nStrikingly Offensive Cloak \u2014 you can fight\nit out amongst yourselves as to who has\nwhat\". So saying he half turned and let out\na strangled cry, \" Reg! You done them\nP.I.G.s yet?\"\n\"Aargle, gra a ably, mumble, next week,\nmate, at the earliest\", came the muffled\nreply.\n\"Don't mess about, Reg\", shouted Mr.\nDrawers, \"I got two blok es here who wants\nthem boots now\". There was a clattering\nand banging from the other end of the shed\nand Reg appeared.\nHe was younger than Alf Drawers and\ncarried what looked like a perfectly ordinary pair of gum boots in his hand.\n\"You can have them now if you wants\",\nhe said, \"But I wouldn't want to walk any\ndistance in them me self. They're done, mate,\nyour main fusion condenser'll go any minute.\nThey don't make \"em like this any more, you\nsee, we gotta get parts from Dagenham.\nWell, it'll take at least a month, what with\nthings as they are. Cost more than the\nboots is worth\".\n\"But we can't possibly wait a month\",\nsaid Ferocious, \"We'll just have to leave\nthe boots, and make do with the Cloak\".\n\"Don't you worry about them boots,\nmate\", said Alf, \"They'll hold up so long as\nyou treat 'em careful, and don't do no stamp-ing\".\n\"But, my dear old mate, what exactly do\nthey do\", asked Ferocious. Alf and Reg exchanged glances.\n\"They're called Partially Invisible Gumboots, right?\" said Reg, finally, \"so that's what they do. 'Ere, let your little mate put\n'em on and you'll see. I hope\" he added\nunder his breath.\nPhosphorous took the Gumboots and stepped into them.\n\"They don't seem to be working\", he\nsaid.\n\"Don't you believe it, dear boy\", said Ferocious, paling visibly, \"Look at your legs\".\nPhospherous looked down. There stood the\nGumboots, but where his legs should've\nbeen going into the boots there was nothing at all. As his gaze travelled up his little\nbody there was more nothing.\n\"Help!\" he said.\n\"How does one turn them off, so to\nspeak\", asked Ferocious. \"You just gets out\nof them, they're quite automatic\", said Alf\u201e\nproudly. Phosphorous promptly stepped out\nof the boots and slowly reappeared.\n\"My dear old Alfred\", said Ferocious,\nrather impertinently, \"They really are not\nmuch good unless they turn invisible as well\nas the person in them\".\n\"You can't have everything, mate\", said\nReg, \"They is only PARTIALLY Invisible\nGumboots. They'll come in real handy if\nyou has to hide in a shoe shop\". Ferocious\ndid not reply.\n\"Right\", said Alf, \"and you'll be wanting\nyour Strikingly Offensive Cloak, what I had\nright in front of me a moment ago\". He\nturned from the counter and started to burrow about in one of the Piles of THINGS\non the floor.\n\"I had it in me very hand\", he muttered,\ndigging furiously.\n\"Here it is, Alf\". shouted Reg, pulling a long purple cloak out from under a stuffed\nBoa-constrictor.\n\"What, dear old mechanical chaps, does\nthat thing do?\" inquired Ferocious.\n\"This, mate, is your Strikingly Offensive\nCloak\", said Reg, \"what Alf and Me has\ncome up with tor putting the frighten ers on\nundesirables. Highly effective, though I says\nit as shouldn't. You try it on, mate, and\nyou won't half get a shock\".\n(continued on page 7)\n1\nChristmas Cards\nChoose from the\nJ.C.

    "content": "December 5, 1972 FELIX Page S What' s in it for us? Another NUS conference has come and gone. What\nhas it achieved?\nHow many of the decisions at it are likely to affect\nyou, the people in whose name it was justified? The\nconference lasts for four days during which time about\n35 hours of debates take place. Obviously, someone,\nsomewhere, thinks it of great importance that this\nshould occur. Hopefully, this article will help you to\nunderstand more about NUS and its relevance (or not)\nto most students.\nAs indicated last week,\nthe main business of the\nconference revolves\naround the debating of\nthese motions which have\nreceived the highest \"pri-or it is ation\". This year the\ntop five items to be discussed were Representation, Housing, Conference\nReform. Grants and Autonomy. These took up\nmost of the time available\nbut such things as Executive Reports, Finance Reports and Elections take\nplace too. An Executive\nReport is a summary of\nwhat the Union Exec has\nachieved during the period\nbetween conferences. Finances are discussed during\na \"closed session\", that is,\none from which all press\nand visitors are excluded.\nElections are held for\nposts that fall vacant due\nto resignation or expiration of term of office.\nThe most important\npart of conference is definitely the production of a motion duly amended and\npassed by the delegates\nwhich is then used by the\nexecutive as an indication\nof the line it has to pursue\nduring the next six\nmonths.\nThe dominant theme in\nall these debates is a fight\nbetween the Executive\n(mostly Communist Party\nmembers) and the extreme\nleft groups on the conference floor (International\nMarxist Group and International Socialists). The\nludicrous state of affairs\nleads to the situation in\nwhich the Executive is\ngiven the appearance of\nan almost reactionary\ngroup. Undoubtedly this\nis one of the major weaknesses with the NUS as it\nstands. The conference\ndebates are normally so\nbogged down in ultra-left\nwing amendments that the\nmain motion is almost forgotten by the time it\ncomes to voting on it. By\nthis time most of the delegates have lost track of\nwhat is happening and so\nthe motion is always\npassed. Hence a Communist Party line on student\npolitics is invariably the\nresult.\nIn the Representation\ndebate for example, Surrey University had included an amendment which\nrejected representation as\na \"Sop to the students\".\nTheir position was that\nany form of representation weakened the stud-ents' position in that they\ncould never affect the\nworkings of the committee\nthey were on since they\nwere always in the minor-it y. Along with this negative position came the\nstatement that \"It is time\nstudents realised which\nside of the class barrier\nthey are on\". This amendment was eventually defeated but not before\nthree quarters of an hour\nof debating had taken\nplace. This was only one\nof four amendments and\nat the end the amended\nmotion was thankfully disposed of. In it was included some strong lines on\nwhat would be acceptable\nto NUS but little thought\nwas given to the students\nwho might be called to\nimplement a strike or similar action.\nAgain and again this\nlack of consideration for\nthe 500,000 students which\nNUS claim to represent\nwas evident. The naive excuse that the ordinary\nstudents are represented\nby their delegates is not\ngood enough. Theoretically, all delegates should\nhave a mandate from their\nown unions on all topics\nof debate, but this is totally impracticable. Too\nmuch work has to be done\nby individual union members for comprehensive\nmandates to appear. In\nthe case of our own\nUnion the deficiencies are\nseen only too clearly. The\nmain motions had to be\nsubmitted before the beginning of the Christmas\nterm so that the complicated procedure of prior it is ation and returning\namendments can be completed in time. This limits\nall the decisions to, at\nmost, the External Affairs\nCommittee and normally\njust the External Affairs\nOfficer. Inquorate Union\nmeetings resulted in all the\namendments being unapproved and the delegates being virtually un-ni an dated. Under these circumstances the correct action\nfor the delegates would be\nto abstain from all votes.\nThis is clearly absurd and\nindicates the need for\nsome basic thought on the\nmatter.\nAs far as I can see there\nis no solution. The nearest\noom parable situation is\nthat of the Government of\nthe country. No attempt is\nmade to mandate an MP\nand it is accepted that this\nis the only way the system could work. It is\nassumed that MPs have\nsufficient expertise and\nconcern for their constituents that they will vote for\nthem where they can.\nHowever, on most.issues,\nof national importance,\nthe MP invariably votes\non conscience, the debate\nover Common Market entry being a good example.\nAlthough some people\nwould disagree (mostly\nthose who go to NUS con-ference s!) the system has\nand is still working well.\nWhere, therefore, is the\ndifference between this\nand the NUS which is not\nworking at all well?\nThe crucial item is that\nof interest. People are interested in who governs\nthe country. They know\nthat a government has immense powers and that\nthese can be used to affect\ntheir lives. Hence when\nthe time comes for an MP\nto be elected he has to be\neasily identifiable with a group which has certain\ndefined responses to running the country. MPs are\nvery rarely chosen by\npersonality, they are chosen by the party they belong to. This selection\nprocess eliminates radical\nelements automatically.\nThe whole system is\nfounded on the fact that\nMPs have to believe in the\nprocess of Parliamentary\ncontrol of the country\notherwise they are not\nselected as . an \"official\ncandidate\".\nHowever, the NUS is\nnot in such a position.\nThe people who are eligible to vote for delegates\nor stand as one are not\nconvinced that the NUS\nhas any power to affect\ntheir lives. Therefore,\nwhen the time comes to\nelect the delegates, , the\nvast majority do not care\nwho is chosen. This allows\nthe small percentage of\nactivists to dominate the\nproceedings. Hence when\nthe NUS claims to represent 500,000 people, noone listens.\nThis sad state of affairs\nis self-perpetuating. As\nlong as most students are\nnot interested, the government will recognise that\nNUS has a minimal\namount of bargaining\npower and act according-ly. This reinforces the\nstudents' view that the\nNUS cannot affect their\nlives and so the circle is\nclosed.\nThis is an inevitable\nconsequence of the fact\nthat students are not dependent on the NUS to\nprovide their jobs and security as is the case with\nTrade Unions. Even assuming that the NUS\ncould cause a national student strike, no-one would\nsuffer as a result of it.\nHowever, if the TUC decides to call a general\nstrike, the country grinds\nto a halt. Obviously the\nfact that society is immediately dependent on workers gives them a power\nwhich NUS can never\nhave.\nIt is therefore impossible for the NUS to have\nany serious affect on any\none. This removes the\nmain reason for its existence as a union, and certainly brings up the\nquestion of belonging to\nit.\nImperial College Union\npays several thousand\npounds for the dubious\nprivilege of belonging to\nit. If the NUS could actually affect the government\nin any significant way (no,\nI do not include the \"with-draw al\" of the DES Green\nPaper on Union Autonomy) then this might be\nworth the money. The\nfringe benefits such as\ncheap travel, insurance,\netc., are of use only to the\nindividual, and do not justify the whole union be-longing.\n' It is therefore, with a heavy heart, that I recommend serious consideration by the Union of\ndiscontinuing our membership of NUS.\nRoss Mc Be aHi CONFERENCE\nTHALIDOMIDE\nA total boycott on products\nof Distillers' Company Ltd.,\nthe company that marketed\nthe drug Disteval (commonly\nknown as Thalidomide) between 1\n9\n5\n9 and 1\n9\n6\n1 was\ncaled for. Distillers' main\nproducts on sale in Unions\nare their spirits: they account for more than 9\n0\n% of\nwhiskies and a large number\nof other spirits. Common\nbrand names are Black and\nWhite, Johnnie Walker, Gordons, etc. DCL also make\nmost yeast used in Britain,\nmarket a considerable number of pharmaceuticals, and\nhave large interests in a number of breweries.\nConference also called for\nthe nationalisation of the\npharmaceuticals industry and\nfor Distillers ito pay suitable\ncompensation to the victims.\nGRANTS\nA major grants campaign\nis to be launched in the New Year. C.O.'s and the NUS Executive aim to mobil is e the\nentire student body behind\ntheir demands for an immediate grants rise, an annual\nreview of grants in line with\na student cost index, the abolition of discretionary awards\nand i the means test, a better\npost-graduate grants system,\nand 1/30 of the full grant for\neach week over the 30th spent\nworking.\nMajor springboard of the\ngrants campaign will be a national rent strike in January to make hall fees and/or\ncatering prices compatible\nwith the national element allowed for them in the grant.\n(They already are a't Imperial and all London college st, but living in the provinces,\nit appears, is much more ex-pensive! !).\nHOUSING\nReiterating the demand for\na national rent strike until\nhall fees fall in line with i the national element in the grant.\nConference also called for the\nabolition of the -'self-bal anc ing\" system for halls imposed\nby the University Grants\nCommittee (UGC) and the\nLocal Education Authorities,\nsuggesting that halls be sub-sidi sed. The motion also said\nthat no more \"totally inappropriate\" halls should be built,\nbut purpose J built student\nflats should be provided in-stead. Deviating slightly,\nFelix will (\nbe publishing a novel solution to 'the student\nhousing problem \u2014 which\nim ll work \u2014 in the series\n\"Felix Financially\" next\nweek.\nREPRESENTATION\nConference overwhelmingly\ndefeated an amendment to\nthe substantive motion calling for the ending of student\nrepresentation in the government of Higher Education,\ntabled by Surrey University.\nThis amendment said that,\nsince students have not got\nan equal say on committees,\nthey cannot influence the decisions of these committees\nand are implicated in the\ndecisions of them whether\nthey agree or not.\nThe substantive, which\nwas equally overwhelmingly\ncarried, called for maximum\nstudent representation on all\ncollege committees, and for\nthe abolition of Privy Council \"Reserved areas\". It also\nstressed that student representatives should be elected\nfrom and by the Union floor,\nsomething which does not al-ways happen. \"There should\nbe the maximum democratic\ncontrol of students union\nrepresentatives,\" it said.\nWOMEN\nCertainly the best report\ncompiled by the NUS Executive for years, \"\nWomen in\nSociety\", the work of the only\nwomen on the NUS Exec, Was\npresented ito Conference.\nConference condemned the\ndiscrimination aga nist women\nand all other oppressed sectors of society, especially\nhomosexuals.\nSTIRLING\n\"Conference believes that\n(Digby Jacks') remarks\nclearly represent a stab in the\nback directed at a group of\nstudents already under\nheavy attack from the bourgeois mass media; and we\nnote the gie e with which they\nhave been received in this\nquarter\". It was thus that\nconference censured the NUS\npresident for his opening remarks at conference. Conference pledged its full support .to the victimised Students at Stirling, and to the\nright of Stirling students .to\ndemonstrate against the \"\nextravagant and unnecessary\"\nvisit of the Queen to Stirling.\nCONFERENCE\nREFORM\nExtensions . of time had to\nbe granted several times to\nget this set of motions, more\nthan 20 of them, through con-ference. Even so, not alt\nof them were debated. This\ndebate saw Imperial delegates at their most voc if e rous, especially on the powers\nof steering committee who,\nas you may remember from\nan article in \"Felix\" a couple\nof weeks back, are the ones\nwho really run the show. IC\nwere Instrumental in preventing several extensions of\npower to Steering Committee\ngetting through. No one is\nlooking forward more than\nthe student press to finding\nout whether the new procedures will make conference\nmore comprehensible!\nSTUDENT\nNURSES\nConference condemned the\nabyss mal pay of student\nnurses, and the appalling\nconditions they were required\nto work under. They are, .\nit was claimed, treated as\nmenials at work and subject\nto oppressive and archaic sy ssem s of hostel ac com moda tion. Conference urged that\nthey be brought as members\ninto the NUS, and that the\nNUS immediately starts campaigning on their behalf.\nAUTONOMY\nUnder its favourite Chairman (and the only competent\none), Ed Straw, Conference\nploughed through the sub-stat ive motion and. seven of\nthe ten amendments (defeat-ing all the amendments except for a small instruction\ncalling for a national campaign on Autonomy) in two\nhours \u2014 quite an achievement in terms of time. The\nremaining substantive, which\nwas carried overwhelmingly,\ncontained instructions to the\nExecutive should the government suddenly re-introduce\nits plans for SU's. In the\nmeantime, it condemned the\nfreezing of Union funds by\nCollege Authorities. It also\ncalled upon the Executive to\ninitiate a campaign against\nstaff treasurers of unions,\nand upon C.O.'s to remove\nthem where they exist. (This\nis the case in Imperial).\n\n"

    "content": "Page 4 FELIX December 5, 1972\nIIS TO THE EDITOR\nLETTE\nJews,\nJowitt,\nand\nJeneralisation\nSir,\nFrom Paul Jowitt's comments on my article in CEFE\nNo. 6 concerning Israel and\nthe letter bombs, it is quite\nobvious that he has not\nactually bothered to read\nproperly what was stated\nthere but has simply taken\na totally biased point of\nview.\nI clearly stated six points\nof fact which indicated that\nIsraeli intelligence was implicated in the recent letter\nbombs campaign. Paul Jowitt goes so far as to admit\nthe truth of the facts, yet\nthen says that surely the\nIsraeli government couldn't have done anything quite so\nnasty and unscrupulous.\nWhat sort of logic is this?\nIt is most unscientific, illogical and totally biased to\naccept all the evidence and\nthen say but anyway it just\ncan't be so\".\nIn any case the Israeli government has shown frequently in the past that it is nasty\nand unscrupulous and will\neven murder Jews simply to\nmake propaganda. During the\n1950's Israeli intelligence\noperators were sent to Arab\ncountries to set off explosions in Jewish shops and\nsynagogues to arouse Jewish\nfears and encourage tension\nbetween Jews and Arabs,\nand to increase the desperately needed Jewish immigration to Israel. The vic-tim s, of course, were the\nJews living in the Arab\nstates such as Iraq and\nMorocco.\nThe Israelis have particularly used the letter bomb\nin their terrorist campaigns.\nIn May. 1948, 25 years old\nRex Farran, student brother\nof a British Army officer in\nPalestine, was killed when\nhe opened a parcel bomb\naddressed to his brother.\nEarlier, on September 3rd,1947, a letter bomb addressed to a Brigadier in\nIntelligence at the War Office\nexploded in a GPO sorting\noffice in south-west London.\nIrgun Zvai Leumi and the\nStern Gang were the suspected culprits at the time.\nEight letters posted in\nTurin to prominent British\npoliticians and senior Army\nofficers were also intercept-ed. Intended recipients included Arthur Greenwood,\nMinister without Portfolio,\nSir Stafford Cripps, John\nStrachey, and Major-General\nEdward Spears, former minister to Lebanon and Syria.\nA parcel-bomb also arrived\nat the home of General Sir\nEvelyn Barker, former Officer\ncommanding in Palestine.\nIsrael later renewed its\nparcel-bomb war. The Sunday Times notes: \"In 1963\nthey (the Israelis) mounted\na short campaign against\nWest German scientists\nworking on rocket and missile projects in Egypt.\n\"It was very successful.\nFour Egyptian technicians\ndied when a scientific manual addressed to their German superior exploded in\ntheir office. The secretary of\nanother German rocket scientist working in Egypt was\nblinded when a parcel, sent\nfrom Hamburg, exploded as\nshe opened it. A parcel sent\nfrom Stuttgart failed to ex-plo de\". Paul Jowitt then accuses\nme of saying thai it was the\nIsraeli government who was\nalso involved in the various\nhijackings and the Munich\nmassacre of Israeli athletes.\nNowhere in my article did I state any such thing. On the\ncontrary; I quote, \"Whatever\nWestern Public Opinion\nthinks about incidents such\nas hijacking or Munich the\nPalestinians at least have the\nhonesty to accept responsibility . . .\". / would be interested in an explanation of\nhow this amounts to accusing\nthe Israeli government of\nthese acts. On the letter\nbomb campaign, responsibility by the various Palestinian\norganisations has specifically\nbeen denied.\nNor did I anywhere state\nthat the gassing of Jews in\nGermany by the Nazis was a propaganda exercise. I absolutely condemn the brutal\nacts of the Nazis against the\nJews or anyone else, how-ever, I equally condemn similar acts committed by others\nincluding the Israeli govern-ment. The daily acts of\nterrorism carried out by the\nIsraeli army against the Arab\npeople in Israel and the\nneighbouring countries, the\nburning of Arab homes, destruction of villages in South\nLebanon and Syria, the\nbombing of refugee camps\nwith napalm and splinter\nbombs may not be so well\npublicised as the Nazi gas\nchambers but the Nazis and\ntheir sympathisers too tried\nto hide their existence for as\nlong as possible.\nWhere in my article Paul\nJowitt found any mention\nwhat s over of the persecution\nof Jews in the Bible I do not\nknow; perhaps he could\npoint this out to me.\nPaul Jowitt's statement\nthat \"the population of\nIsrael is 100 per cent behind\nthe Israeli government's attitudes towards the surrounding Arab countries\" is firstly\ncompletely unsubstantiated,\nsecondly illogical \u2014 nowhere\nis there 100 per cent support for any similar issue\u2014,\nthirdly, disputable from a factual basis. I would advise\nPaul Jowitt to read (without\nturning every sentence\naround to say the opposite)\nthe book \"The Deceived Testify\" by Ghenrikh Gafman,\nwhich gives actual examples\nof what the people of Israel\nreally think.\nZionism is in fact not in\nthe interest of the Jewish\npeople. The aim of Zionism,\nwhich began in the last century as a reaction to European\nantisemitism, was to gather\nall the Jews together in Palestine \u2014 the Chosen People\nin the Promised Land. This\nis a defeatist and escapist\nsolution which never gained\nmuch support among Jews so\nthat even today 90 per cent\nof Jews still live outside\nIsrael. It did however win\nsupport from countries with\nan interest in the oil resources of the area.\nZionism's first success was\nwhen Balfour declared official British Government support for it in 1917.\nSubsequently the British\nmandate over Palestine\nopened the door to the refugees from Nazi persecution.\nWhen the numbers had\nswollen sufficiently, a short\nsharp military campaign established the state of Israel\nin 1948. The Palestinians,\nwho had lived in Palestine\nfor 1,500 years, were driven\nout by Zionist terror (the\nmassacre of Deir Yassin, in\nwhich the total population of\na village, men, women, and\nchildren were murdered and\nthrown down a well, will\nrank forever in the annals of\nbarbarity).\nAs for the borders, the\nIsraeli State has continually\ntried to expand itself. The\nstate established in 1948 was\nlarger than the United Nations Plan for a Jewish State\nin 1947. Even now after the\nhuge expansion of 1967,\nIsrael is still trying to extend\nits borders into Syria and\nLebanon. The so-called\n\"genocide threat\" is just a pretext for expansion. Most\nof the Palestinian groups\nhave as their aim to establish a non sectarian state of\nPalestine with Jews and\nArabs living together. It is\nthe Israeli government which\nis being unreasonable by insisting on a totally Jewish\nstate where a few Arabs are\npermitted provided they forego most of their rights.\nAs for Paul Jowitt's five\nclosing paragraphs, they are\nquite unrelated to the ques-tion. I suspect that he is on\nan ego trip and is trying to\nshow off some knowledge of\nancient history.\nFinally, Paul Jowitt's whole letter is based on his\nassumption that I support\nthe Black September move-ment. I nowhere said this or\nimplied this in any way (even\nPete Giliett'was capable of\npointing this out to me at\nthe time). I do not in fact\nsupport this organisation as\nI believe that terrorism gets\none nowhere and is in fact\nharmful to the Palestinian\ncause. I was merely giving\nevidence that this organisation was not in fact responsible for one particular act\n(i.e. letter bombs) which\nhas generally been blamed\non them.\nI would repeat the Felix\neditor's footnote to a different article by Paul Jowitt in\nthe same issue \u2014 \"Next\ntime, please Paul, read the\narticle before criticising it. i think, to quote you, 'you got\nit wrong'.\"\nYours sincerely,\nSONIA HOCHFELDER.\nFoot Speaks\nSir,\nAfter nearly a term now\nof 'closed-shop\" union act iv i ties, I hope that this letter\nwill help to improve the quality of our representation\ncommittees.\nVery often, the Union has\nrepresentation where many\npeople do not realise (did\nyou know there is a computing services committee?).\nFurthermore the people who\nget elected (usually by\nCouncil) to such committees\ntend to communicate very\nlittle to the Union as a whole.\nIn some areas\u2014e.g. Academic Affairs,\u2014people get to\nknow their reps fairly quickly \u2014 good.\nBut judging from the number of letters to Felix on\nrefectories, it appears that\nfew students realise we have\na refectory committee \u2014- let\nalone who we have elected\nto it.\nOne of the main purposes\nof floor reps \u2014 yes, they do\nhave a purpose! \u2014 despite\ntwo columns on the front\npage of Felix two weeks\nback telling you to the contrary \u2014 thus preventing any\nmention of the fact it was\nRag Week on the front page\nof Felix (honest! \u2014 it was\nRag Week!) \u2014 as I was say-ing, one of the main purposes of floor reps is to help\nyou find out who your reps\nare on any particular committee and to badger them\non your behalf if you wish,\nor even, if necessary, call\nfor their resignation.\nFurthermore they can represent you at joint council\nand . help elect the council\nmembers you would like to\nsee on Bookshop Committee,\nBar committee, etc.\nIt is a pity I have left it so\nlong telling you what my job\nis, when my job is telling\nyou what jobs other people\ndo.\nYours, etc.,\nG.W. FOOT,\nMaths 3, ICU Floor\nRep on Council.\nFoot Speaks\nAgain\nSir,\nI must confess I have\nnever seen a waste of\n\u00a31,00 as ICU is wasting\non its two sabbatical officers\nthis year.\nOur Secretary (not Hon.\nSec. \u2014 we pay him you\nknow) spends all his time on\ncommittees which ordinary\nmembers of the Union can\ndo \u2014 and his spare time doing other peoples jobs and\nleaves his work unfinished.\n1) The minutes of the previous Council meeting, and\nthe reports to be presented\nto council, arrived in council's letter rack the morning\nbefore the meeting.\n2) The minutes of the last\nUnion meeting were, as ever,\nunpublished before the\nmeeting.\n3) He was late to that\nmeeting.\n4) He could not organise\nanything so simple has having two people on each ballot box for the last election.\nRegardless of how much\nwork he does, if he deprives\nus of valuable minutes, re-ports, etc., we can make no\ncontribution whatsoever, and\nthe Union becomes a one\nman show (Yes, a show).\nOur other sabbatical officer spends his time editing\na newspaper he is too lazy\nto distribute around I.C.( Sennet) and leaves Felix to\nhis spare time.\nHe makes the task of\nediting Felix easy, by serial-ising books in a Daily Mirror\nmanner, having a large area\ndevoted to sports and reviews (he doesn't have to do\nany work on these pages)\nand padding out the letters\nwith sarcastic comments\n(why should he be the only\none in the Union who can\nget his own back?).\nAfter he has written large,\nwell - spaced - out articles,\nwith big boxes saying 'Per-son al viewpoint of Oliver\nDowson' in the middle, there\nis just a tiny space left, usually on page 2, for some real\nnews.\nWe wanted a secretary and\nan editor of Felix and we\nmade them sabbatical so as\nto give them plenty of time\nto chase up other people \u2014\nbut they do the 'job\" or\nsomething approximating to\nit, on their own and make a right mess of it.\nHoping for a return to the\ndays of Sugden's Daily\nMirror . . . .\nG.W. FOOT,\nMaths 3.\nFoot-note\n/ am afraid that I cannot\nhelp but reply to Mr. Foot's two letters. In his first, he\nshows that he has no knowledge whatever of what a floor rep is meant to do \u2014\nsurely to represent the floor\nof the Union? I sent a Felix\nreporter to stop passers-by on\nthe walkway and ask them\nwhat they knew about floor\nreps. Most of them had never\nheard of them . . . even fewer\nhad heard of Mr. Foot, and\nfew of them knew he was\none. \"People who get elected\nto these committees tend to\ncommunicate very little to\nthe Union as a whole\" he\nsays. I look forward to the\nday when he communicates\nto the Union Floor what\nhe is doing in their\nname, and makes them\nknow that he is their\nrepresentative. I haven't had\nany letters on refectories this\nterm. What's the good of\nsomeone who only tells you\nwhat other people are meant\nto do and does nothing him-self, please ?\nAs regards the comments\nabout myself in the second\nletter, it would be nice if Mr.\nFoot got some facts right. I spend little if any time on\n\"Sennet\" \u2014 a mere four\nhours every other week. I am no longer Editor of that\npaper. I do have to work on\nsports and reviews pages \u2014\n/ have to make them literate,\na task which really needed\ndoing on both your letters, especially the first one which\nwouldn't get past the 11 -plus.\nI also have to type out all the\narticles, and lay them out on\nthe page. Any news that\nthere is \u2014 and there isn't much \u2014 gets on page 1, unless technicalities force it to\nappear elsewhere. If you want\nto know what the job of editing Felix is like, and what I do, I suggest you follow me\naround for a week and find\nout. But get some sleep first,\nbecause you won't get much\non the job. If your job is telling other people what jobs\nother people do, find out\nwhat the jobs involve first\n. . . now I wonder what a floor rep is meant to do . . .\nMore on\nLager\nSir, \u2014 / must thank Richard King for pointing out the\nfiner points of Carlsberg I Watneys marketing tech-ni que. I did know that the \"Gold-en Mermaid\" Carlsberg was\nan important but, as Richard\nKing rightly explained, it is\nvirtually unobtainable in London and my accounting for\nthe difference would have involved a disproportionate\namount of space in the\narticle.\nIncidentally, Bass, Charrington last week declared a profit of \u00a348.9 millions, an\nincrease of 24 per cent over\nthe previous trading year.\nTurnover, however, only increased by 14.4 per cent . . .\nYours affectionately,\nMARTIN DOUGHTY\nLivestock\nExport\nConcern\nSir,\nMay I, through the courtesy of your paper, draw the\nattention of students and\nstaff to the RSPCA CAMPAIGN TO STOP THE\nEXPORT OF LIVE FOOD\nANIMALS, which follows a report by their Chief Veterinary Officer on the appalling\nconditions our livestock are\nexposed to during and after\nexport. Britain joins the\nCommon Market on 1st January, 1973, and while it will\nnot be possible to get the\nnecessary legislation through\nParliament before then, it is\nthe intention of the above\nSociety to continue to put\npressure on the Government\nto pass a law prohibiting the\nexport of food animals to\ncountries (several of which\nare in the EEC) which are\nnot using humane killing\nmethods in their abattoirs.\nIt is quite clear from recent\ninvestigations that the old\nBalfour \"Assurances\"\n(1957) are no longer sufficient to protect these animals and many of the foreign\nabattoirs are being allowed\nto slaughter our livestock in\nconditions which would not\nbe tolerated in any of our\nabattoirs. If old laws, to\nwhich some of these countries are signatories, are being ignored at will, it is\nimperative that our Government realises this and guts\na stop once and for all to\nthis despicable treatment of\nour British-reared livestock.\nFor many reasons a car case only trade must be subst it u ted, and these reasons are\nclearly outlined in an excellent leaflet produced by the\nRSPCA which also contains\na report by their Chief\nVeterinary Officer. I strongly\nrecommend that your readers\nsee this. The facts are presented in a non-emotional\nway and quite apart from\nthis human angle there are\ncost implications for the\nBritish Taxpayer which everyone ought to know about.\nSupplies of this leaflet may\nbe obtained from me on ringing Int. 2593 or direct from\nthe RSPCA, 105 Jermyn\nStreet, London SW1.\nI appeal to everyone interested to please get in touch\nwith me with a view to\nsigning a petition in support\nof the campaign or if preferred they may write direct\nto the RSPCA. All letters,\npetitions, etc., will be taken\nto the House of Commons\nbefore the end of December\nby the Vice-Chairman of the\nRSPCA who is also an MP\nand presented in support of a Bill which it is hoped will\nbe quickly passed through\nParliament. There is a very\nstrong feeling, I am told, in\nthe Commons about this\ncampaign and more and\nmore MPs (over 200 to date)\nare signing motions to put\npressure on the Government\nto end this needless suffer-ing.\nThe RSPCA needs YOUR\nsupport. This is not an appeal for money, only for\nsignatures. Will you please\nhelp?\nYours faithfully,\nSHEILA D. STUART,\nCollege Block.\nUnion\nv. Parker\nResolved\nSir,\nMay I express my appreciation to you and to the\nmany students who supported me during my dispute\nwith certain members of the\nI. C.S.U.

In order to\nmake this election con-st it ut ional, a Union General Meeting had to ratify the election and the\nCollege authorities must\napprove.\nThe . Union meeting\ncalled for Thursday\nlunchtime was the least\npublicised one of term,\nno posters, bump h or\neven ad in felix appear-ing. However, quite a lot\nof people came, mainly\nat the instigation of the\ncandidates.\nHowever the Secretary\n(Martin Black) and Deputy President (Paul\nJowitt) did not: they put\nup a notice in the Great\nHall announcing the\ncancellation of the meeting before the time that\nit was due to convene\nand did not,come along\nto check whether anyone\nactually turned up. By\ntwenty past one, a meeting of Imperial College\nStudents had been started under the chairmanship of Rosemary Parker, President of RCSU\nwhen along came the\nICU Executive to find a good three hundred people in the hall, and accordingly started a UGM\nproper.\nAfter agreeing to ratify the election, even before the result was an-noun ced, various amendments were passed and\ndefeated, and it was\ndeemed that the elected\nPresident would become\nActing President if the\nCollege Authorities did\nnot ratify his election.\nThe results were then,\nannounced: on the first\ncount John Lane got 424\nvotes, to Ian Farnell's288, Adrian Smith's83, William Wood's29 and\nPete Gillett's24.

I wandered over to the Great Hall\nto tell any friends who turned up and found a vast\ngathering of seething masses \u2014 a very healthy sign\nindeed. Even healthier the meeting proceeded to railroad the Exec \"rather than vice-versa. The UGM itself\ndecided to ratify the election without further discussion,\nbefore the result was known. It clearly indicated that it\nwould stand behind whoever was elected even if the\nCollege Authorities did not accept the election.\nWith any luck, this new enthusiasm can be built on\nto get this union moving again.\nE.G. M. It is vital that NUS conference would be properly\ns discussed before end of term. A number of important\nGovernment decisions may be taken soon on student\nunion autonomy and post-graduate loans instead of\ngrants. Next term the NUS grants campaign gets under\nway. We must come to some clear decisions about\nIC's role in these campaigns and that means good discussion at a well attended EGM.\nRefectory Committee\nMy first involvement in the College Bureaucracy\ncame only 2 hours after becoming President at the\nRefectory Committee which consists of representatives\nof staff, students, admin, etc. Some interesting points\ncame up. The kitchens are infested by cockroaches and\nhave a really big problem with cleanliness. Steps are\nbeing taken but student vigilance is essential both to\nkeep the clean-up permanent and to spot the mice pie.\nComplaints about cuts in portions and long queues\nwere, I think it would be fair to say, fobbed off. Your\nportions of chips have not been halved merely to cut\nback to what they would have been if the servers hadn't thought that the nice boys needed to eat! I think students should discuss in more detail a proposal I made\nin the election campaign. That is that as well as the\npresent representation the re fec committee would have\nto report to students, staff, etc. in a general meeting\nwhere more direct criticism could be made and the\nextent of discontent felt.\nLastly an interesting sidelight on the way private\ncompanies can influence a college. Rob Armitage\nbrought up the NUS boycott of Distillers' Co. (DCL)\nproducts, e.g. whisky, until they compensate the\nthalidomide children out of the vast profits they made\nby high pressure salesmanship of Thalidomide. When\nit was under strong suspicion. Could the re fec committee back up the Union if we decide to run a boycott by\nproviding clear notices and labels in the bars? The\nanswer was that the college couldn't upset DCL because they supply liquid gas and run some scholarships.\nAlso, it would be embarrassing for anyone to buy a DCL whisky with a Union boycott notice nearby. The\nlast reason was a point of principle. Perhaps there are\nhigher principles?\nMARTIN'S BIT\nI apologise to the readers of Felix for not providing\nwhat must be one of their favourite features in the last\nfew weeks. This, basically, is because there was then\nvery little to write about.

The probation and after-care service offers real opportunities\nfor young men and women graduates. This is demanding but satisfying work\nwhich calls for an unusually high degree of initiative and personal responsibility if effective help is to be given to a wide variety of people.

M.A. won the toss (well, they were big girls) and\nI.C. took the kick off and they were off. From the start\nit- was a scrappy game, neither side capable of a clean\ntake and the I.C. men failed to get on top. Scrum followed scrum with the M.A. scrum-half not liking the\nway the I.C. scrum-half was putting it in, but eventually I.C. were penal is ed for foot up (even though the\nI.C. hooker reckoned it was only seven inches). I.C. players came in d ribs and drabs till at last they had a full side up and had to give two extra players to satisfy\nthe other side's needs. The chauvinists from I.C. managed at last to show their prowess, when Ken \"don't touch me, I'm married\" Horseman stormed over for the\nfirst try. However, Boadiceas Anonymous were undeterred and came back (a trifle kinky but quite practical) and soon levelled the scores by a devastating\nseries of net-ball tactics.\nHalf-time followed and the I.C. team reckoned the\npresent emergency demanded \"Women and Children\"\ntactics, so straight from the kick off into the Round\nPond went big Ethel and her babe in arms Laurence\n\"Stand Up\" Adams. However, these strong arm tactics\nwere of no avail, and despite being well chaste (tactical\nmisprint) I.C. failed to capital is e on M.A.'s boobs in\ndefence and they had it with the.screaming horde ending up on top. Despite I.C. putting up a firm stand,\nM.A. soon wore down their left and right to go straight\nup the middle and touch down twice to take the match.\n1.C, puffing and panting hard, covered well until the\nfinal blow brought proceedings to an end. The end of\nthe game however, was marred by the arrival of two\ngentlemen in blue uniforms pushing bicycles (try one,\nbetter than pot any day), who said it was not the done\nthing to play Rugby in a Royal Park (a cunning\nThatcher plot after Stirling University, we ask?) but\nwere informed it is not the done thing for dear old\nladies to bring on their precious little dogs to soil a nice\nclean pitch.\nFun and frolics were had by all and I.C. claimed a moral victory as no virgin i ties were lost, though Johnny\nMcDonough was last seen groping in the park looking\nfor his.\nQuote (by LC. player): \"It was against the true amateur traditions of the game, they were all pros\".\n2nd Quote (by another I.C. player): \"They played\nlike a load of women\".\n3rd Quote (by I.C. player leased to M.A.):\"I hope\nMy Dinga-Ling is still number one\".\n4th Quote (by the Big Lad): \"It was too short\".\nTeams: I.C.

However, we made up the team by recruiting an\noverworked star member and eventually arrived at\nBrunei's gravel pit. There was only a light breeze so\nsailing positions changed frequently on the downwind\nlegs. In the end Brian Rogers got clear wind and went\nahead to win with Simon Briscoe 3rd and Nigel Charlwood 4th. In the second race l'C boats got ahead from\nthe start. Ian Hopkins forgot what boat he was in and\nsucceeded in ramming the opposition so had to retire\nand watch from the shore as Jim Scott and Dave Law\nfinished 1st and 2nd, winning the match.\nOn the Sunday, John managed to find Southside on\ntime and the whole team set off for Reading.

The\nsecond team, playing in the same division as the firsts,\nare also doing well and are, in fact, unlucky to have\nlost a match.

They've lost one away match but\nthat was because the home team didn't bring enough\nbiscuits. The smooth running of this team depends entirely on players arriving late, or not at all, as this\nhas been of vital strategic importance on more than\none occasion. (We claim the match if they do it to us.)\nThe third team, also boast about their trophies obtained this season: 3 beer glasses, 1 tube of shuttles,\nseveral packets of biscuits and 5 signs.\nIC IVths or the third team reserves are also having\na good season, winning all matches so far.

Rob\nAllinson, Dave Payne and Neil Boag were 48th,77 th and 88th, followed by Steve Webb who was 101st after\ntwisting an ankle and trying to go the pretty way. Dave\nJones was 102nd.A combined team from the London\nColleges finished second to Bristol out of 15 teams.\nAnd then we went to Kings. And won. Steve and Ian\n(Both Knees and an Ankle) Isherwood were taking\nscores and so, with a Lancashire-accented \"Go!\"\ntwenty-two runners from King's, LSE and IC burst into\naction, in the drizzle, trying to find their way round a long and winding course, led in fine style by Dave\nPayne. After crossing railway lines, running beside the\nWandle (I Wandled lonely as a cloud . . .) (Since when\nhave sportsmen been literate ????\u2014Ed.) and generally\ncausing chaos in the streets of Mitcham, three intrepid\nrunners from IC surprised our score-takers by storming in in the first three places, Relieved for once from\nearly pace making, Paul had yet another truly amazing\nrace finishing first, followed closely by Rob Allinson\nand Barry Dabrowski and several King's people. Dave\nPayne was 8th and Neil 12th. Packing at the back were\nDave Johns (15th), Pete Johnson (17th), Paddy Donnelly (19th), Ray Maddison and Hugh Culverhouse.\nTeam scores were IC 26, Kings 39 and LSE 63.

Answers next week.\nHockey\nSaturday saw our fifth league match, against the\nleague leaders, Old Thamesians. Before the game was\nten minutes old T's were two up and many long face?\nin the defence were wondering whether they should\nhave stayed at home. At this point a good run and\nshot by Dave Richman put the ball in the back of the\nnet, but the umpire ruled no goal \u2014 outside the D or something. This decision was hotly disputed, but\nto no avail.\nIn the second half the defence bottled up the opposition attack so well that even when an open shooting\nchance appeared, they were so surprised that they wasted it. The attack was in devastating form\u2014everyone has their own methods! \u2014 and produced first a goal by Mick Downs from a corner scramble and then\nprobably the best solo goal of the season by J.

It started well for IC when\nstraight from the bully-off, a cross from the left\nwas slotted in by Dave Richman. However, later, in the\nspace of ten minutes Silverwing scored three times.\nWithin ten minutes of the start of the second half IC\nwere back on level terms with a fine run by Dave Richman who took the ball to the goal-line, from where\nhe crossed for Jag Gahir to touch in, and then a flick-on-the-dive by Dave which completely fooled the\ngoalkeeper.\nThe game then began to swing from end to end with\nSiiverwing retaking the lead from a short corner. However, Andy Tatehall broke through on the right and\nflicked the ball into the net to make the final score\n4-4.\nMixed Hockey\nHaving travelled out to the wilds of Royal Holloway College on Sunday, a depleted IC mixed team\u2014\nyet again! \u2014 managed to emerge with a creditable\ndraw. RHC proved to be a very strong team, and a very entertaining match ensued The first half was very\nevenly balanced with fi\nrst one side then the other\ngaining the upper hand. The second half was very similar to the first, but thanks to some strange umpiring\ndecisions RHC gradually became more dominant.

So what better way to start than\nto explain why this is so?\nApart from the obvious fact that\nBroadsheet is the only one worth paying for (and we only charge the mere\npittance of lp) the main reason is that\ncharging is the only way to ensure it is\ndistributed properly and read by those\nwho are really interested. My job would\nbe a lot easier if we just dumped a number of Broadsheets in each department and left them to be picked up, but\nby getting the social reps to sell them in\n(heir departments we ensure that not\nonly every department has the opportunity of buying a copy but also can keep\na check on how Well certain editions do\nand which departments are keen to buy\nit and which not. The fact that we\nactually get some money back to help\ncover costs (although it never can since\neach copy costs over Ip in paper alone)\nis really of secondary importance. Sales\nin all departments, with the notable exception of Botany and Zoology (despite\npersistent efforts of the social and departmental reps) have been very\nencouraging this term, reaching the\nmagic figure of 500 for all of RCS\nOf course some copies are given free\nand the few left over stored in the RCS\noffice where they may be purchased any\nlunchtime (hint, hint!).\nThe purpose of Broadsheet is to inform and entertain the people of RCS\nin matters concerning them directly and\nalso to cover some wider topics in the\ninterests of variety and completeness.\nWe have established this term a number\nof regular features, namely a serious\ncrossword, literary serial \"Boggin the\nBog\", strip cartoon serial \"Dart\", hitting\ncomment column \"Necromancer\", and\nEnts Page (of varying sizes), as well as\nthe usual news and reviews features,\neditorial and presidential comments,\nvice-column and (following hot on the\nheels of last year's Martin's Bit) \"John's Bit\" (who's she\u2014Ed.). We also welcome,\nand frequently get, articles from members of RCS on all sorts of topics, some\nhumorous, others very serious. All\narticles received, via the Physics letter-rack addressed to me, or left in the\nRCSU office, are considered for publication and inclusion depends on the\namount of space available.\nOwing to the extreme difficulty (i.e. virtual impossibility) of getting foolscap\npaper at present, Broadsheet last week\nbecame an all A4 edition for the first\ntime, complete with new front page\nheading. Every edition now is usually\n12 sides in length which means even\nmore hard work for the non-sabbatical\neditor, comes out every other Thursday\nmorning.\nNow that you all know about Broadsheet, next term I 'll have other items of\nnational urgency and international\ninterest. Until then I 'll leave you with a little problem I mentioned a couple of\neditorials ago. What sings Chinese\noperas in the bath, dances on top of\nQueen's Tower at full moon, but is read\nall over?\nHappy Crimble and a very new year,\nRON (Appleby)\nBroadsheet Editor.\nTHE QUILLER MEMORANDUM\nAdam Hall (Fontana, 30p) Exciting, frightening, true to life . . .\n\"'Quiller, British agent, lone-wolf living\nclose to the knowledge of his easy ex-p end ability sets out to upset a neo-Nazi\nplot. Remorseless . . . a story that holds\nyou\".\u2014Evening Standard.\nI think to a certain extent I agree, as\nJames Bond type-thrillers go. In fact,\nthis stands out as one of the best. The\nQuiller Memorandum, or the Berlin\nMemorandum as it was called when it\nwas first published in 1965 has certainly\nstood the test of time well.\nI had never read this novel before,\nyet it still maintained its grip of fear\nover me. Written at a time when the\ncold war was still in our minds and the\nBerlin Wall had only just been com-ple ted, this must have been a really\ndevastating novel. I suppose that most\nof the techniques used by our hero\nQuiller are not used by the real-life\nRosenburgs, Vassals and Kimbys \u2014\nhowever, who am I to know. It all\nseemed very realistic to me. I must admit that Quiller is pretty lucky with\nsome of the things he gets away with:\nhis reasoning doesn't exactly make him\nthe next Chomsky. Perhaps the most\nannoying habit of Quiller's is to manage\nto get out of his tight spots with the\nabsolute minimum of physical violence\nbut by the maximum of mental effort.\nThe story is very strong and holds\nyou to very nearly the end of the book\nalthough 1 did find the end rather\nscrappy and a little untidy. This may be\nbecause trying to finish a novel such as\nthis in an acceptable yet realistic way\nis not particularly simple. Adam Hall\ncarries out a fine job and I think that\nFontana have made a wise decision on\nreprinting, especially when you consider\nsome of the terrible novels released re-cent ly. This Will not probably make a very\ngood present, but buy it for yourself to\nread over the boring Christmas after-math.\nEditorial\n(continued from page 2)\ndevelop films at all hours\nof night to meet deadlines.\nAny student newspaper\nis only as good as these\npeople. And since these\npeople are students them-selves, it is not unreasonable to suppose that their\nviews can be identified\nwith by a number of the\nreadership, whatever the\nviews expressed. The over-a j l aim is communication:\nthus every student paper\nshould carry as wide a range of views as possible.\nNo student paper can\nafford to turn down good\ncontributions, whatever\nthe views expressed.\nAnyone who gives up\ntime on a project for\nwhich he gets no reward\nother than to see his name\nin print has a completely\njustifiable pride in the\npaper he has helped to\nproduce, especially in\nthose parts of it which he\nhas directly been responsible for and which bear\nhis name. To have his\nwork altered or mutilated\nin a way repugnant to him\ndoes nothing but alienate\nhim from the Editor. Student should not be set\nabove student, especially\nnot in the student press\nworld: as the ULU Handbook puts it, \"People willing to work on the student\npress are gold dust and\ntreated with the same\nlove\".\nRegrettably this is not\nalways so. There are, so it\nseems, still student newspaper Editors around who\nbelieve that everything in\ntheir papers should be just\nthe way they like it \u2014 regardless of what anyone\nelse thinks, let alone the\nperson or persons responsible for the contribution\nin the first place. These\neditors call it \"Editorial\nControl\" \u2014 their unfortunate staff have other,\nharsher, words for it. I have just heard of a case\nin a London student paper\nwhere a correspondent\nspent much of a day compiling information for\nand writing a full-page\nfeature. The feature was\na serious one, and the correspondent \u2014 needless to\nsay, after spending all that\ntime on it \u2014 was anxious\nfor the article to appear\nas she wanted it to. But\nthe Editor decided to put\nan entirely in cong rous picture on the same page,\nwith a \"funny\" caption\nwhich made it seem to\nrelate to the (dead seri-o us) article. It reduced the\nwhole page to trivia. It\nreduced the correspondent\nto tears. She won't write\nfor that paper again, and\nI can't blame her. That\npaper has lost one of its\nbiggest contributors . . .\nand in most student news-papers, losing your least\ncontributor is a disaster.\nThe Editor didn't even\nconfer with her before\ndoing it. He won't budge\non the picture's going in.\nIt's a rather puerile at ti tude.\nAs one of the few sectors of the press not controlled by the advertising\nbarons, the student press\nshould be showing the\nway forward in catholic\njournalism. There is no\nplace for autocracy in the\nmental build-up of a student newspaper editor.\nWhether it is a question\nof politics or one of\npurely subjective likes and:\ndislikes, no Editor should\never impose his whims on\nhis staff of contributors.\nThere is an enormous\nrange of opinions held by\nstudents: who is the Editor to decide which ones\nshould be voiced and\nwhich not? There is a lim ji to how far an Editor\ncan put himself above his\nstaff if he wishes to retain\nthe loyalty of both\nthem and the readers: it\nis not a very high one.\nThose who go above it do\ntheir readers, their contributors and the student\npress in general a grave\ndisservice.\nOf course this aim of\nprinting all shades of\nopinion is somewhat Utopian; it is only possible to\nprint what gets contributed. Felix doesn't print\nthe articles some suggest\nit should purely and\nsimply because no-one\ncontributes them, and\nnone of the existing Felix\nstaff are capable of writing them. (Their views\ndon't tally). If they were\ncontributed, they would\nget printed, and no-one is\nkeener to see this happen\nthan me. So before those\nof you who are critical of\nFelix's politics (and there\nare many of you, I know)\nflood my pigeon holes\nwith angry letters, and my\nears with angrier sayings,\nplease sit down and write\nan article for publication.\nI don't know if anyone is\ntrying to suppress you or\nyour views, but I'm not\n. . . and I won't guillotine\nyour article or trivial is e it\neither.

Instead of Ferocious\"\nusual angular features, there appeared beneath the hood a hideous skull-face, faintly\nluminescent, with deep-set blood-shot eyes.\n\"Has something untoward occurred?\"\nasked the skull.\n\"Ferocious, you're horrible\", said Phosphorous, trying to climb over the counter.\n\"Not bad\", said Reg, \"Pretty nasty isn't it?\"\n\"Do you mind\", said the skull, \"I 've never\nclaimed to be handsome, but there is no\nneed to be rude\".\n\"Take the hood off and you'll be back to\nnormal\", said Reg. Ferocious lowered the\nhood and beamed around.\n\"Not much difference really, is there?\"\nsaid Alf.\n\"Watch it, inventive sir\", said Ferocious.\nThe intrepid duo were now fully equip-ped, so they took their leave of Alf and Reg,\nleft the Adventure Stores, and set off along\nthe beach.\n\"What do you think we ought to do\nnow?\" asked Phosphorous.\n\"Your guess, dear boy, is as good as\nmine\", replied Din, \"I suppose we search\nout this Twigworm character, and do something about his plight, so to speak\". Just\nwhere to search did not immediately occur\nto the hardy adventurers, so they sat down\non the sand for a moment to think things\nout.\nFerocious was just starting on a comprehensive recap of the situation as he saw it,\nand Phosphorous was dropping off to sleep,\nwhen the sand in front of them began to\ntremble and vibrate.\n\"I say\", said Ferocious, \"can this be a minor earth tremor, do you think, old fruit?\"\nBut no, it a pea red that something was burrowing its way to the surface of the beach.\n\"Perhaps it is the Twigworm itself\", said\nPhosphorous, stepping back to avoid the\nflying sand.\n\" A not dissimilar thought had crossed my\nmind, old friend\", said Ferocious. With a final flurry of sand, a small sign on a pole\nappeared, as if poked up by an invisible\nhand from beneath. The sign was yellow-painted, and in black letters it carried the\nlegend \"TO THE TWIGWORM\" with an\narrow pointing down the beach. In the bottom left-hand corner were the letters \" A. A.\" \"That must be Adventurers Association\",\nguessed Phosphorous.\n\"Possibly', said Ferocious drily, \"What\nan organisation these people have, to be\nsure. I would suggest, dear lad, that we follow the sign, and see where it leads us\".\n\"O.K.\" said Phosphorous. And they did.\nTrudging along the interminable beach.\nFerocious mused on the problems inherent\nin this adventure;\n\"You see, Phosphorous\", he said, \"this\nbeing a TINY twig worm, I would surmise\nthat finding it in all this sand may prove\nsomething of a, shall we say, problem\".\nHardly had he spoken than the two rounded\na dune to be faced with a huge pile of old\ntractor tyres.\n\"Oh, look at that\", said Phosphorous,\n\"what a rotten thing to do, to dump a pile\nof old rubbish like that on this nice beach\".\n\"Dearie, de a rie me\", said the pile of old\ntyres, \"Oh woe is me\", and burst into tears.\nThey had found the Twigworm.\n\n"
