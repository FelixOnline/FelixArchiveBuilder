Luckily I\u2019ve already learnt\nmy lesson in this department, having\ntried to introduce myself to someone\nabout ten minutes earlier, only to have\na drink poured over my head by their\nboyfriend for \u201cstanding to close to\nher\u201d. Or at least that\u2019s what I gleaned\nas I tried hard to listen with my loose\ngrip on French.\nSo I\u2019m sitting there, not really feeling the beer-fruit juice cocktail drip\nin places o\ufb00 my hair, when a larger\nthought dawns on me, and not for the\n\ufb01rst time. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m in France.\u201d\nI\u2019m not talking about the pleasing,\npicture-book, peering-out-of-plane-window moment, the \u201coh look down\nthere, we\u2019re in France\u201d moment. No.\nI\u2019m talking about the dark, suddenly-dawning \u201coh fuck, what\u2019ve you done,\nyou\u2019re here for the next ten months\u201d\nmoment. A moment I was becoming\nall too familiar with.\nhe same notion had come mind\nabout a week or so earlier when,\nwhilst crossing what was probably the\nmost pugent dance \ufb02oor I\u2019ve ever had\nthe pleasure to cross, the entire club\n(no exaggeration) broke into a dance\nas the DJ played \u201cWho Let he Dogs\nOut\u201d. I was completely blindsided.\nFor the one, said DJ had, up until this\npoint, only played the kind of tracks\nthat you\u2019d expect David Guetta to\nconsider for a set but ultimately throw\nout, and for two, I had no fucking clue\nwhat was going on. So I stood there,\nwaiting and watching this weird cross\nbetween the Macarena and some\nMoonie ritual, made all the weirder\nfor being acted out by a roomful of\nsweaty French youths, many of whom\nlooked as though they were still trying to shake o\ufb00 the \ufb01nal shackles of\npuberty. In retrospect, I think this is\nwhat people refer to as a \u2018cultural experience\u2019 but at the time I had myself\nan \u2018oh fuck\u2019 moment. Maybe that, after all, is the beauty of cultural experi-ences. Who knows.\nAnother such moment came on\nthe coach ride to where we are now, a\nsmall out-of-season ski resort, Lanslebourg, made all the more charming\nfor sounding like the ancestral home\nof a certain former health minister.\nhe trip hadn\u2019t started well. Ahead\nof the \u2018Weekend d\u2019Integration\u2019 (no\nprizes for translating that one\u2019) the\nstudent body had been a-chatter with\nrumours of where the secret destination might be. Having gone to Cannes\nthe previous year and with Grenoble\nmaking the most of global warming,\nboth J-co (the other Anglophone Imperial export) and myself had packed\nfor a weekend at the beach. As those\nof you diligent enough to have already\ngoogled Lanslebourg will have found\nout, beach is not something found in\nits vicinity. So strapped into the coach\nand clearly not heading for the coast,\nour troubles were compounded as the\nchanting began. \u2018Mauvais ambience,\u2019\ntranslating basically as \u2018bad smell\u2019 and\nrepeated ad in\ufb01nitum, was a particular favourite, acted out by lifting one\narm in the air and patting the arm pit\nwith the opposite hand. At the start of\nthe trip it wasn\u2019t one I\u2019d heard before.\nBy the end, I had might as well had\nit tattooed somewhere on my body,\nvisible to me, such was the degree to\nwhich it was (and still is) ingrained in\nmy mind. I do wonder if, like stoners\nand he Game, someone, years later,\nwill remind me of it, and a little world\ninside my head will come crashing\ndown. Who knows.\nAt this point my drunken reverie is\nshattered as J-Co, wearing the other\nI\ndress that came with mine (a snip at\n\u20ac12 for two, a belated bid at fancy\ndress), comes up to me and reminds\nme that they\u2019re about to start serving\nTNT (a popular local cocktail made\nfrom vodka, Orangina and a regional\n55% percent liqueur, that they ration\nto appear only once every hour) from\na hatch about 20 metres away.\nNo sooner had he said it, I knew\nthere were graver matters at hand\nand I grasped around the \ufb02oor for my\neco-cup (to be elaborated upon another day). I closed my eyes,thought\nof Metric, and staggered my way to\nthe queue.\nThe entire club\nbroke into a\ndance as the\nDJ played\n\u2018Who Let The\nDogs Out\u2019. I\nwas completely blindsided.\nDon\u2019t waste this space.\nWrite for us!\nFollow us @feliximperial\nFacebook\nWebsite\nTwitter\nVisit us felixonline.co.uk\nLike us facebook.com/FelixImperial\n\n"

    "content": "CLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n10\npacked out itinerary involved travelling over\n2000 miles and visiting\n8 di\ufb00erent states on the\n13-day tour. From NYC,\nwe headed north to New Haven to visit\nYale, where we were able to experience the oldest and most established\na cappella scene in the world. We sang\na set outside, amongst their beautiful\ncampus buildings in the baking sun,\nbefore watching a \u2018singing dessert\u2019\nconcert from one of the 17(!) a cappella groups there, before attending an\namazing house-party thrown for us by\nour guests there. For more detail of all\nthese events, see our tour blog at: www.\nunion.imperial.ac.uk/arts/acappella/\ntechtonics.\nFrom Yale, we continued onwards to\nProvidence, RI and Brown University\nto visit our friends the Brown Derbies.\nWe hosted and performed with these\nawesome guys when they were in London as part of a European tour earlier\nthis year, and they aptly returned the\nfavour, providing another amazing\nevening of education into American\nculture, student life, and a cappella\nmusic.\nhe next day saw a change in direction as we headed back south through\n6 states to Georgetown, near Washington DC. It let us experience the feel of\na true American road-trip, and spirits remained amazingly high, despite\nhangovers, heavy tra\ufb03c, and a 300-mile diversion taken by one car whose\nsat-nav had an aversion to Delaware.\nWe stayed with a lovely host family\njust outside the town and caught up\non some sleep missed on the last three\nnights.\nNow the tour turned to business, and\nthe Techtonics arrived at the \ufb01rst of 4\nschools we would visit on the tour. Our\nvisit to Georgetown Day School saw us\nperform in the high school assembly\nbefore taking workshops for their music classes and a cappella groups. he\nreception was incredible! he British\nboy-band e\ufb00ect took over and we were\nmobbed for photos and autographs\nafter every performance; a new experi-The A Capella Tour 2012: Ea\nence for most of us. his also gave us an\nexcellent opportunity to sell a few copies of our debut album: Groundbreaker,\nwhich was released just before we left\nfor the USA.\nFrom Georgetown, we headed back\nnorth to Philadelphia and to the wonderful hospitality of Tom and \u2018Broad\nStreet Line\u2019 from Temple University.\nhe evening\u2019s not-so-secret \u2018supersecret activity\u2019 involved going to see\nthe Pentatonix; one of the best and\ncertainly most famous contemporary\na cappella groups in the world at the\nmoment. he gig was incredible, and\nafterwards a few of us even managed\nto get photos with the group as well as\npalming a copy of our album to them.\nStill buzzing, we headed back to our\nhost\u2019s house on the subway, and were\nshown yet another amazing house-par-ty; we were so spoiled by the generosity\nof our hosts.\nFollowing another deep yet brief\nnight\u2019s sleep, we were shown a whistle-stop tour of Philadelphia by Tom and\nMolly, our fantastic hosts. his included experiencing Philly cheese steaks\nand running up the Philly Museum\nof Art steps, as seen in Rocky. Sad to\nleave just as we\u2019d settled in, the group\nheaded back on the road and back to\nNYC and Columbia, where we met our\nhost Eliana from another group called\nthe Clefhangers. We sampled some\nmore greasy (cheaper) local cuisine\nbefore heading onto the picturesque\nColumbia campus where we took part\nin an informal concert of a few songs\neach with the Clefhangers. By the end,\na hefty crowd had gathered, including\npeople from the far side of the campus,\nwho had heard the music and seen it\nas a good excuse to take a break from\ntheir studies. We then headed down\nto a (fairly) local bar, where we got to\nknow our hosts a little better despite\nthe extortionate drinks prices. Pleas\nfrom some of the harder group members for a longer night out were quickly\nquenched, as the group had seemed to\nhit the proverbial wall, so we headed\nback to the rooms where we were staying for some well overdue sleep.\nhe next day\u2019s schedule gave the\ngroup a good chance to spend a proper tourist day in the Big Apple. Some\ngroup members awoke early to take\none of the cars across to a free parking\nspace (hard to \ufb01nd) at the school we\nwere to sing at the next day, and also to\nget in line for Broadway matinee tick-ets. Others slept in more, before heading out to see all the sights. Between the\ngroup, we covered most of the major\nNYC monuments, but the real special\nmoment of the day was for the lucky\n6 of us who just happened to bump\ninto our biggest idol, a cappella and\nmusical legend, Bobby McFerrin. he\ngroup sang for him, which he said was\n\u201ca real gift\u201d before giving him a copy of\nour album. he rest of the group were\ndevastated at missing out, and despite\n8 time Tony Award winning Broadway\nshow, Once, being amazing, it did not\ncompare to meeting such a huge idol.\nhe evening saw us meet our hosts\nfor the next 2 nights, the wonderful\nfamily that is all the people at Leman\nSchool, Manhattan. We were to spend\nthe next day giving classes, workshops,\ndiscussions on studying in the UK and\n\ufb01nally a concert at the school. he families were the best hosts that anyone\ncould ask for \u2013 from skyscraper pent-houses, to why-would-I-want-to-keep-my-Emmy-anywhere-other-than-my-upstairs-guest-bathroom, we had such\na wonderful experience. he evening\nsaw us hosted at a beautiful BBQ with\na chance to meet some of the teachers,\nparents and kids for the next day.\nAfter a night of the best rest on\ntour so far, we joined our respective\nhosts\u2019 children on the school run to\nthe amazing school. Situated about 2\nblocks from Ground Zero, and with\n360 degree views of the best skyline in\nthe world, this was some school! We\ntook two music classes in the morning and were received extremely well,\nby the students and music teacher\nalike. After a chance to eat their amazing school lunches, some of us took\ntime to head to Ground Zero and Battery park (to see the Statue of Liberty)\nwhile others talked to some students\ninterested in studying in the UK, and\nothers prepared the amazingly set out\ntheatre (also in the school) for the gig\nthat evening. his was possibly one of\nthe best gigs that the Techtonics have\never performed, and it has given us\nnew ideas about the impact that a good\nand well used microphone setup can\ndo for our performance; this is probably going to be a major project for the\nyear ahead.\nWe were mobbed by kids and parents alike afterwards, and sold many a\nsigned CD to the families. We then said\nour temporary goodbyes and headed\nfor Stone St. where we joined the high\nrollers of NYC in some appropriately\npricey drinks. We then returned to our\nfamilies (via an excellent \ufb02orist) and\nwere able to relax and get to know our\nhosts a bit more. One more amazing\nnight\u2019s sleep, a couple of loads of laun-dry, and another early morning later,\nwe were saying some very sad good-byes.\nWe jumped back in our cars and\nheaded to Brooklyn and Poly Prep\nSchool, where we were to perform in\ntwo separate assemblies, for the high\nschool and middle school. he reception was incredible once more, the kids\n(and especially the girls) absolutely\nloved it, and the sheer enthusiasm for\nmusic, a cappella, and the English accent never ceased to amaze. Straight\nfrom the school, we headed north to\nupstate New York, where we would\nspend the remainder of tour. We arrived in somewhat ominous thunderclouds to Syracuse, and met our\nhosts in a greasy pizza place that we\u2019d\nbecome accustomed to. he evening\nthat followed was fantastic once again;\non dropping our bags at respective\nhosts\u2019 houses, we met up for an a cappella house-party with 4 of the a cappella groups from Syracuse. he loft, a\nvenue which \ufb01t up to 100 people, complete with makeshift stage, bar, and\nping pong table was up there with the\nbest venues we had the pleasure of performing in. Also the party afterwards\nwas incredible, and lots of new friends\nand contacts were made.\nhe next morning gave us the opportunity to see how Varsity is done\nproperly; Syracuse, generally considered the NY state capital for college\nsport, was out in force to support their\nteam, and considering that events like\nthat occurred at every home game of\nthe year, the di\ufb00erence in college spirit\nvalue was clear to see. Leaving yet another set of lovely hosts at Syracuse, we\ntook the short (by comparison) drive to\nRochester to meet our next hosts, the\nYellowjackets. Competitors on hit US\nshow, \u2018he Sing O\ufb00\u2019, the Yellowjackets\nare both very talented and very well\nknown. However, it was clear to see\nthat in essence our groups were very\nsimilar, which was a good indication\nto us that we were somehow doing it\nright! After a lovely free canteen din-ner, we headed with the Yellowjackets\nto the venue (an ex-frat house) and\nshared the stage at their homecoming gig. Even though we had improved\nso much on the tour, it was clear that\nthere was always more room for im-provement, and the Yellowjackets\nshowed us some of the ways to do this.\nAs became a tradition on the tour,\nwe were not only treated to an incredible gig but our hosts then threw yet\nanother amazing social occasion for\nus afterwards. he following morn-ing, we headed with the remainder\nof the Yellowjackets to the incredible \u2018Sled Dog Studios\u2019, in true (sitcom\nstyle) American suburbia. he team\nthere was amazing; all professionals\nin the a cappella and music industries,\nthey hosted us amazingly all day, with\nendless amazing food, conversation\nand enjoyment, with the added bonus\n$500,000 recording studio in the base-ment. We spent the whole day there,\nwith a short break to head down to the\nRIT campus for a casual performance\nwith RIT 8 Beat Measure, and as with\nmany places we experienced, it felt like\nwe could\u2019ve spent at least the week. We\nthen headed for our \ufb01nal hosts of the\ntour, the lovely Juli, and the local families that lived around her.\nhe next morning saw our last proper chance for a morning o\ufb00, which we\nthought it would be a shame to take\nwhen Niagara falls are only a short\n(again, relatively) drive away. Up at the\ncrack of dawn (with a couple of slight\nalarm-missing incidents) all but 2 of us\nheaded out to the falls with the plan of\nheading to the Canadian side (a better view, plus why not make the tour\ninternational!!). However, the mixture\nof an early morning and a long tour\nmeant that not all members managed\nto remember to bring passports for this\ninternational border crossing. Not deterred by the thought of trying to clear\nCanadian Immigration (or even US Immigration on return) without said appropriate documentation, Eugene con\ufb01dently drove across the bridge only to\nbe met by less-than-impressed CanaA\n\n"

    "content": "LOLCATZ OF TEH WEEK: Finding these is a perk of the job\nTim Arbabzadah\nEditor-in-Chief\nDon\u2019t diss-repute me\nOnce more I find myself writing this\nright at the last minute. Standard spelling error warning. Maybe this is good as\nit lets me just be completely honest.\nThis week, my hands were tied (met-aphorically, not some kind of thing I\u2019m\nin to) and I had to put a Union story right\nup there on the front page. For those of\nyou who don\u2019t care about the Union at\nall, and don\u2019t register it as existing: I\u2019m\nsorry. For those who find it really inter-esting: Huh? Really? You do? Oh, okay.\nI joke, of course.\nThe Constitution has changed. Sort\nof. It needs to go to the Trustee Board\nand is then sent off to College Council.\nObviously the Trustees are going to\npass it, and then College probably will\ntoo.\nContentious points? Well, the one\nthat catches the eye is the disrepute\none. It is actually already in the College\ndocuments that bringing the name of\nImperial into disrepute can mean you\nare disciplined, and the President can,\nand does, intervene in such disciplinary\nmatters. I would like the meaning of\n\u2018disrepute\u2019 to be clarified, so that people\nare protected if they want to speak out\nand give an opinion on the Union with\nno fear. It\u2019s possible, in my view, that\npeople could be deterred from speaking out if they know they can be disci-plined. Although it wouldn\u2019t make good\npublicity for the Union when it gets out.\nIt is just worrying that it could be used\nin a twisted way years on down the line.\nAlthough it is unlikely to occur, it should\nbe protected against. I\u2019m glad that there\nis protection for those reporting things,\nbut it should also be cleared up that it\ndoes not curtail someone\u2019s free speech;\nit should be made apparent that people\nare still allowed to criticise the Union.\nObviously any organisation needs to\nprotect itself from lying, and it\u2019s good\nto have less formal measures than being taken to court for libel, but it doesn\u2019t\nhurt to have extra protection in place to\nstop abuse of rules. This could be in the\nform of an extra line or two, much like\nhas been done to protect people reporting on matters to do with the Union.\nIt is important to note that, as with\nother rules, I would assume that if you\nsay \u201cthe Union are xyz-ist\u201d you are allowed your opinion, and it would be the\npeople doing the xyz-ism, if they were,\nwho would be disciplined (rightly so)\nfor bringing the Union into \u201cdisrepute\u201d\n(legal chat for \u201cmaking them look like\na bunch of wankers\u201d). Crucially, I ASSUME this. I like to think I\u2019m a reasonable person, but what if the people in\ncharge were not so easy going? That\u2019s\nwhy you need to make sure assumptions are incredibly hard, nigh on im-possible, to make.\nI should mention that you can always,\nif wrongly accused, say \u201cnah, fuck this\nI\u2019m opting out\u201d. Although you won\u2019t be\nallowed in the Union (they don\u2019t ID everyone at all times, as it\u2019s hard to, and so\nyou can probably get in pretty easily),\nand wouldn\u2019t be allowed in any Clubs or\nSocieties(whowouldtellonyouturning\nup to an event though? Again, in practice easy to get around). I only mention\nthis to show how, in real terms, while\nimportant, these are all so minor in the\ngrand scheme of things. When you\u2019re\nworrying yourself about your next lab\nreport at 1am, tell me how much you\ncare about point 2.342321235. ab. iii.\nNot saying that priorities coming up\nmeans that you don\u2019t care, or aren\u2019t allowedtoforgetit,I\u2019mjustremindingyou\nthat, after however many years, you\nleave this place and the Union behind.\nIn an out-of-character move I\u2019m going\nto say that the only good thing about\nthewholedisreputestuffisthattheUn-ion can protect you from College by disciplining you for them. This is what the\nUnion should always do: protect you\nfrom College, and stand up for you and\nyour rights to make everything better.\nNow back to frantically pulling out my\nhair while I attempt to finish the paper.\nAlso, I left my glasses at home today.\nThat was really annoying.

    "content": "\u201c\nCOMMENT\nComment Editors: George Barnett,\nNavid Nabijou, James Simpson\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\ny now, you might\u2019ve\nheard the news about\nthe Italian scientists that\nwere found guilty of failing to warn the populace\nof the earthquake that devastated the\nregion of Abruzzo three years ago.\nhe Grandi Rischi (Great Risks) is a\ncommission of experts on calamities\nwhose purpose is to monitor the likelihood of such catastrophes happening,\nand to advise on how to avoid them\nor mitigate their e\ufb00ects; according to\nthe judges, they failed to predict the\nearthquake and therefore are at least\npartly responsible for the over 300\ndeaths, thousands of wounded and\ntens of thousands of evacuees.\nhis sets an extremely dangerous\nprecedent, and indicates a troubling\nattitude towards science. Earthquakes,\nas events, are very hard to foretell and\nin general almost no scienti\ufb01c prediction can be made with 100% con\ufb01dence; to require absolute certainty\nin this matter is preposterous. But\nscience is seen as \u201cthose nerds in lab\ncoats who always know things.\u201d It is\nalmost as if omniscience is the norm,\nand whoever claims to be scientist\nmust be prepared to be always right\nor face the consequences; almost as\nif science is a dark art from which to\nconjure answers. Who, in the scientific community, can a\ufb00ord no margin of\nerror whatsoever? Who can even get\na \ufb02awless record in predicting such\nmatters?\nNow, we must be fair. Italy is no\nstranger to corruption, and there are\nchilling tales and records of phone\ncalls documenting how the boss of the\nProtezione Civile (Civil Protection)\ntold the committee to downplay the\nrisk of earthquake to prevent panic in\nthe population, and that other experts\nhad predicted the earthquake and\nwere ignored. However, while this is\na shameful example of science always\ncoming second to politics, seismologists from America, Japan and Switzerland have reacted to the news of\nthe trial by claiming that the data was\ncontradictory and that, in the same\nposition, they would\u2019ve also given\nsimilar advice.\nMany are now commenting that it\nwould\u2019ve been better for the scientists\nto err on the side of caution and warn\nthe population anyway; but Italy is a\nhighly seismic zone: does this mean\nthat we should be constantly crying\nwolf? It has been extensively determined that, with current methods, it\nis impossible to predict with su\ufb03cient\naccuracy the occurrence of an earth-quake; to treat every possible hint as\nan emergency might create alarmism\nand cheapen the value of warnings.\nPietro Aronica\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n20\nB\nItaly\u2019s new Illuminati\nHigh-risk zones should be equipped\nto deal with such events, but to demand unerring precision is irrespon-sible.\nhe problem is, fundamentally, one\nof scienti\ufb01c education, and the need\nto give someone the blame for the\ncatastrophe. his combination led\nthe public to perceive that experts\ncould\u2019ve predicted the earthquake but\ndidn\u2019t, and hence must be punished\nand tried. People of Abruzzo cheered\nat the court\u2019s decision, claiming that\njustice had been done, when in fact it\nwas a mockery and a farce: a mockery,\nbecause it grossly misinterprets how\nthe scienti\ufb01c process works, and a\nfarce, because it was little more than a\nsearch for scapegoats.\nIf the committee actually bowed to\npolitical pressures and reassured that\nthere was little risk of a calamity without doing a more extensive analysis, it\nis troubling and it should be addressed\nmore fully; but they never discounted\nthe possibility of an earthquake. People choose to ignore this because it\nis easier to see the question as one\nof people who didn\u2019t do their job, because their job isn\u2019t actually under-stood, and because it is more reassur-ing, in a perverse way, to think that it\nwas due to human error rather than a\nrandom and unpredictable whim of\nnature.\nhe adage comes to mind, that any\nsu\ufb03ciently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, and that\u2019s\nwhat scientists are seen as: sorcerers\nwho deal with incomprehensible arcane matters. And like them they are\nburnt at the (metaphorical) stake for\nthings that the public does not under-stand.\n(Yes, it\u2019s that guy from University Challenge!)\nn 1615, Galileo was tried and\nconvicted by the Italian inquisition for his unorthodox\nviews on the heliocentrism of\nour solar system. His denial to\ncomply and bend over before the established power threw him into house\narrest until the end of his life. However, it also sparked a scienti\ufb01c revolu-tion, an attempt to distance knowledge\nfrom established sayings, dogmas and\nstories, whilst giving birth to one of\nthe brightest periods of humanity. For\nthe \ufb01rst time, knowledge and the logical search for truth were put ahead of\nfairy tales and excuses to sit on gold\nthrones under marble cupules.\nNow, it seems, Italy has decided\nthat science\u2019s nice and fruitful run has\nreached its end, and decided to return\nto its old methods of castration of the\nintellect and witch hunting.\nI understand that the press is probably not reporting the case in the right\nway; that there was probably avoidance and trampling of established\nemergency protocols under seismo-logical alerts; that if the scientists did\nnot mess up the \u2018advice\u2019 they gave on\nwhether the whole town was going to\ndisappear o\ufb00 the face of the Earth or\nnot, plenty of lives might have been\nsaved.\nHowever, what amazes me is how\neasily authorities can punish a scientist for wrongly predicting something\nwhich is by de\ufb01nition unpredictable,\nyet can let \u2018Nobel prize winners\u2019 (I do\nnot believe in Economics to be Nobelworthy) or any big framed, patchy\nheaded CEO walk away freely after\ntheir wrong \u2018predictions\u2019 collapse entire economies and, with them, millions of lives.\nhe di\ufb00erence between these two\nis exactly the same one that separates\ndoctors from holistic reiki touch therapy scumbag con artists or pharmaceutical research from watered down\nsolutions of watered down active\ncomponents, so watered down they\ndon\u2019t exist anymore.\nAnd as long as we don\u2019t get these\nstraight and this tendency to punish\nknowledge (or the attempt to achieve\nit) continues, our society, our minds,\nwill keep on \u2018involving\u2019, until we return\nto the dark ages where knowledge and\nlogic were too scared to \ufb01ght mythology and bullshit.\nSearching for\nsomeone to blame\nI\nDiogo Geraldes\nA dangerous step backwards\n\u201d\na mockery,\nas it grossly\nmisinterprets\nhow the\nscientific\nprocess\nworks, and\na farce, as\nit was little\nmore than\na search for\nscapegoats.\n\n"

After some relatively quick\nquestioning, we managed to safely reunite on the US side, and those of us that\ndid remember passports walked across\nto experience the best side of Niagara,\nleaving those that forgot to watch from\nthe still very impressive US side.\nFollowing this eventful morning,\nwe headed straight back to Rochester to do an assembly performance at\nRochester School of the Arts, a local\npublic school. We were once again to\nperform, John Lennon bare-foot style,\nat a school assembly, and, becoming\nfairly used to the celebrity lifestyle by\nnow, were mobbed by the high school\nstudents for photos and autographs af-terwards. We then had the full school\ntour from one of the assistant heads,\nand found that despite it\u2019s slightly\nrough exterior and challenging situa-tion, it was a thriving and interesting\nschool. Once our guide remembered\nthat we were not actually prospective\nparents and stopped selling his school\nto us, the tour was completed and we\nheaded back to Juli\u2019s house for a nice\nrelaxing afternoon. After some sleep/\nskype/dinner/choral music around a\npiano time, we began to prepare for\nthe \ufb01nal gig of our tour; an intimate\nperformance to the locals in Juli\u2019s back\ngarden. he setup was beautiful, and\nwith the clear night sky above and the\nperfect acoustic, this was a really \ufb01tting\ngig to end a fantastic tour. he families\nwere fantastic and really enjoyed our\nperformance, which showed by the\nCD\u2019s that we managed to sell after-wards.

    "content": "SPORT\n47\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFollowing a good performance but\nbad result against Kingston 2s in their\n\ufb01rst BUCS MARS South Eastern 5C\nleague match, Imperial Men\u2019s football\n2nd team hosted St Mary\u2019s men\u2019s football 5th team at Fortress Harlington\non Wed 24th, looking to pick up their\n\ufb01rst points of the season. Due to a\nhost of injuries and absentees, Imperial were forced to make several changes\nto their starting line-up. Consequently Pete Nugent, Andy Smith, Bilal\nNasim, Luke Butler and Kume Feese\nreplaced Dom A\ufb00ron, Bilal Abou Ela\nBourquin, Dan Moxham, Alex Dale\nand Josh March.\nImperial started brightly, with Kume\nFeese earning a penalty after being\nruthlessly taken down in the penalty\narea. Kume con\ufb01dently stepped up,\nonly to hit one of the worst penalties\nin footballing history, passing the ball\ndown the centre of the goal to the delight of the St Mary\u2019s keeper. A cagey\n15 minute period followed, with both\nteams exchanging blows. Imperial\nlooked assured at the back marshalled\nby club captain Sami Dabbagh, and\nBilal Nasim asserted his authority in\nthe centre of mid\ufb01eld. Imperial \ufb01nally\nbroke the deadlock when a wicked\ncross from Sam homas was inadvertently headed into his own goal by the\nSt Mary\u2019s left back. Imperial continued to press and a move that started\nfrom the left with Sam homas and\nLuke Butler was swiftly manoeuvred\nto the right, followed by a neat interplay between Alex Hassan and Bilal\nNasim giving Bilal the opportunity to\nthread a through ball to Kume, who\nmade amends for the earlier penalty by\nburying the ball low across the keeper\ninto the bottom corner. Immediately\nafter, Jon Mitchell nearly scored one\nof the \ufb01nest goals of the season with\na run past 3 St Mary\u2019s defenders down\nthe left wing, before cutting inside and\nshooting just wide of the far post. Half\ntime, 2-0.\nhe emphasis from captain Will\nWright at half time was to keep composed in the \ufb01nal third and the goals\nwould continue to come. his was to\ncome true within 10 minutes of the\nrestart, with Sam homas carrying\nthe ball in\ufb01eld from left back, \ufb01nding\nKume in the box who backheeled the\nball to Jon Mitchell, leaving Jon with a\ndi\ufb03cult opportunity that he took \ufb01rst\ntime, smashing low and hard into the\nbottom corner. Ten minutes later Imperial completed their scoring, substitute Tim Tolkmitt seeing his shot\nsaved, allowing Kume to follow up\nfor his second of the game. Substitute\nTom Greenwood, entering with 25\nminutes remaining for an impressive\nLuke Butler, could then have added\nthree more goals for Imperial, his lively movement getting him into good\npositions but his attempts on goal\nbeing denied by the St Mary\u2019s keeper.\nOverall, a very good performance and\na comfortable victory. With a point\nto prove, Kume Feese was a constant\nthreat and caused problems for the\nSt Mary\u2019s backline all game, and as a\nresult was deservedly awarded man of\nthe match by his teammates.\nhe day started with Phil spreading\nspeculative rumours that a certain\ndreamy ex-Club Captain would be\nmaking a cameo appearance for Imperial 4s. Unfortunately, the deal was\nscuppered at the last minute when\nLambe\u2019s current club (his parents)\ndecided that he was too important\na player to let go of. To make up\nfor lack of a deadline day deal team\nnutritionist, Cann made pre-match\npancakes for his captain.\nhe news got worse for captain\nMcGrath when Nwobu and Marks\npulled out at the last minute requiring\nan emergency loan deal from the 5s\nwith Varanese slotting in at left back.\nAfter transport issues for the oppo-sition, the delayed kick o\ufb00 provided\nample time for Imperial to warm\nup and get used to the questionable pitch. A cock-up by the current\nFixtures Sec. meant the game was\nmoved to the darkest corners of Harlington (a better Fixtures Sec. would\nnever have let such disorder occur).\nOn the plus side, McGrath had the\nforesight to bring some speakers for\nthe changing room. hese, combined\nwith a playlist full of some of the dut-tiest choons known to man, allowed\nfor an increased motivational presence in the changing rooms.\nhe match started with Imperial\napplying pressure from the o\ufb00. he\n4-2-3-1 formation was set up with a\ncontinental style in mind. Tiki taka\nwas the order of the day. However,\nthe Nou Camp is never expected to\nhave a trench dominating one half of\nthe pitch. Several bobbles also made\na crisp passing game di\ufb03cult. With\nGassier dominating in the air the ball\nspent much of the \ufb01rst twenty minutes in the St. Barts half but without\nany conversions. Gusty conditions\nlimited much of the play to the right\nhand side of the pitch with Strampelli\nand Faisall creating some good link\nup play down the right side. he best\nchance came when McGrath sprayed\na ball to a free Strampelli who subsequently played a lovely through\nball over the centre back\u2019s head to\nan advancing Bizzell. However, the\nBarts goalkeeper rushed out quickly\nand blocked the shot. Moments later\na push in the back on Bizzell in the\nbox resulted in screams of \u2018penalty!\u2019\nbeing directed at the referee. Alas,\nthese proved to be fruitless as we had\nbeen provided with a referee who,\nperhaps, was just the wrong side of\nlenient.\nSadly, the tide of the game soon\nchanged with the \ufb01rst goal coming\nfrom a Bart\u2019s throw in. With the opposition mid\ufb01elder given ample time\nto cross the ball in and with the Imperial defence outnumbered at the\nback, a free man headed the ball into\nthe near post. Late goalie call-up\nStillwell was unable to do anything\nabout this.\nWith only 5 minutes of the \ufb01rst half\nremaining Imperial were desperate\nto get a quick equaliser. hankfully,\njust two minutes later Strampelli\ntook it upon himself to change the\ncorner kick taker to himself and then\nproduce quite possibly the worst\ncorner ever witnessed on a football pitch. With the ball bouncing\nalong the \ufb02oor quick thinking from\nMcGrath meant he was the \ufb01rst person to reach the ball at the near post\nand play it across goal. Luckily, the\ngoalkeepers \ufb02ailing arms were not\nenough to prevent the ball landing in\nthe back of the net.\nAfter a brief half time team talk\nboth sides returned to the \ufb01eld of\nplay hoping to start the second half\nthe stronger. Imperial failed to do\nthis though and, within the \ufb01rst ten\nminutes, found themselves a goal\ndown again. After a pathetic attempt\nat a throw from Stillwell the ball\nended up at the feet of the opposition left back just thirty yards from\ngoal. A quick ball seared the defence,\nwith the striker lobbing the ball over\nthe goalkeeper. However, Stillwell\nthought his blushes would be spared\nwhen he saw Cann running back to\nattempt to prevent the ball going over\nthe line. Yet Cann seemed to momentarily forget which side he was meant\nto be playing for as he proceeded to\nboot the ball into the back of his own\nnet with a \ufb01nish that Alan Shearer\nwould have been proud of.\nAfter unjustly falling behind for the\nsecond time, Imperial had to dust\nthemselves down once again and\npress for another. Once more, this\nhappened relatively swiftly. A quick\nthrown in from Strampelli found\nBizzell in the penalty area. He laid\nit back to an open Faisall who just\nneeded to ping the ball into the empty net. hankfully, this was done with\nno hiccups.\nImperial could sense blood and\nbrought on van der Bie for Strampelli to add another striker on to the\npitch. he chances came thick and\nfast. A cross from the byline by Bizzell evaded everyone, including the\ngoalkeeper, and was only prevented\nfrom going in the back of the net\nby the woodwork. Further pressure\nfrom the wings courtesy of Samad\nand Bizzell piled the pressure on the\nBarts defence, yet the next chance\ncame from an unlikely source. Finding himself with acres of space on the\nright hand side of the pitch Watkin\nbombed forward with the ball. On\nreaching the opposition penalty area\nhe took his chance yet the goalkeeper\nwas quick to rush out and block his\nattempt.\nTempers were clearly \ufb02aring with\nthe Bart\u2019s players seeming most likely\nto lose theirs. he \ufb01rst incident occurred when Bennett kicked the ball\ninto his own head with Stillwell picking the ball up. Clearly, some of the\nBarts players were unfamiliar with\nthe rules of Association Football as\ncries of \u2018pass back\u2019 were heard. Luckily, these were quickly shot down\nby the referee. Soon after, a fracas\ndeveloped between the opposition\nright back and Strampelli, in his new\nposition of linesman. Despite being\nat least 15 yards o\ufb00side, the Barts\nplayer decided that this wasn\u2019t good\nenough and demanded to know why\nStrampelli was doing exactly as the\nref had instructed him to do. he\nreferee gave him a stern talking to.\nHowever, Barts were not the only\nteam to lose their heads. Samad received a warning after swearing at\nthe referee.\nhe grand \ufb01nale climaxed itself\nwith just four minutes of the game\nremaining when a Barts attack broke\ndown and a quick counter attack\npresented itself to Imperial. Samad\nreceived the ball on the half way line\nbefore turning his opponent and\nplaying a sumptuous ball through to\nvan der Bie. With Bizzell screaming\nfor the ball it was dutifully played\nthrough. Several Barts players were\nclosing down the ball yet Bizzell\nreached it \ufb01rst and knocked it over\nthe goalkeeper. he ball seemed to\nhang in the air for what seemed like\nan eternity. When it \ufb01nally reached\nthe goal it became clear that it had\njust sneaked its way inside the post.\nCheers of delight rang round with\nMcGrath running the length of the\npitch to provide hugs and kisses. By\nthe time he had made it into his own\nhalf for the kick o\ufb00 he was clearly\ndone for the day and told Gassier that\nhe would be doing no more running.\nHad Lambe been present we would\nsurely have heard calls of \u2018Justice\u2019 as\nImperial had certainly had the better\nof the game.\nMoments later the \ufb01nal whistle\nwent. here was clearly stark contrast between the two teams\u2019 emotional states. Whereas Imperial players were \ufb01lled with a mixture of relief\nand pure ecstasy, Barts looked understandably downtrodden. However,\nthe Imperial players did not seem to\ncare about this. With Imperial winning 5 out of the 6 games Little Harlington was a rainbow of happiness\nafter the games. Even Arctic conditions in the showers could not dampen the spirits. A post match choon\nsession occurred before a night of\ngetting merry with the Old Boys in\nthe Union. Overall, it was fantastic to\nget a \ufb01rst win of the season underway\nbut harder challenges will present\nthemselves this season with UCL 4s\nnext up in the Saturday league.\nWill Wright Football 2s Captain\nFootballers beat Mary\u2019s and Bart\u2019s\nMilo McGrath Football 4s Captain\nLadies, would you?

Apple has continued with their\nmovement into cloud storage and\nhas also removed the optical\ndrive on the Macbook Pro\n(meaning no CD/DVD\u2019s\nfor all the retro oldies/\nhipsters who still use\nthem). he 13\u201d (penis\nMacBook Pro) has the\nsame features that the\nnew 15\u201d has as well,\nso you can expect AirPlay, documents in\nthe cloud and Power\nNap. Although it is\n\u00a3500 cheaper than\nits bigger brother,\n\u00a3999 for the cheapest model is still quite expensive. he\nquestion is, when price isn\u2019t a crucial\nfactor, who would want the MacBook\nAir with this new Pro out?\nMac mini\nhe \ufb01rst of the two minis mentioned\nin this keynote, the Mac mini is Apple\u2019s budget computer and it has \ufb01nally\nseen an overdue upgrade. Hardwarewise, the Mac mini now has ivy bridge\nchips, Intel HD graphics, WiFi, three\nUSB 3 ports as well as a thunderbolt\nport. he di\ufb00erent variations range\nfrom 500GB to 2 TB of HDD memory\nand the higher end version can be a\nOS X server, which all in all makes this\nquite a nice desktop to own.\niMac\nAfter an extremely long time and lots\nof moaning by iMac users, Apple \ufb01nally updated the \ufb02agship of its Mac\nrange. Incredibly thin (at just 5 mm)\nand light (shedding 3.6 kilos compared to the previous model) it\u2019s hard\nto believe that such a powerful computer can be encompassed within. he\nscreen has now been laminated directly onto the outer glass and it\u2019s 75% less\nre\ufb02ective than the previous iteration.\nhere is also now a HD FaceTime cam-era, with dual microphones, to make\nSkype/FaceTime calls that bit sharper\nand clearer. he new iMac also has Ivy\nbridge processors up to 32GB RAM as\nwell as 3TB of HDD memory. Like the\nnew MacBook Pro though, there is no\noptical drive, so once again you are limited to a SD card Reader,\nUSB ports and\nThunderbolt.\nSomething new\nthat\u2019s quite exciting though\nis Apple\u2019s Fusion Drive. As\nthe name suggests it is a fusion between\nFlash\nand HDD, allowing for the good performance of \ufb02ash-based storage with\nthe storage size of hard disk drives.\niPad (the big one)\nJust six months after releasing the\n3rd generation iPad, Apple has pretty\nmuch screwed over all their customers\nwho bought one (or more). his is because of the release of a brand spanking new iPad, with the new lightning\nconnector, better processor as well as\nbetter graphics. his has pretty much\nmade the 3rd generation as obsolete\nas the iPhone 4. he price is just the\nsame as before, so if you didn\u2019t \ufb02inch\nand buy the iPad (3rd generation)\nearly, this might be a good buy for\nyou. For all the rest of you, who are\nannoyed at Apple\u2019s uncaring attitude,\ntough luck and better luck next time?\niPad mini\nhe mini pretty much came out as ex-pected, and we did do a rumour roundup a two weeks ago (have a read online\nif you want), but for all you people who\ndidn\u2019t read that article, here is a short\nsummary of what happened. he iPad\nmini is a 7.85\u201d tablet that you can hold\nin one hand. It is as thin as a pencil and\nweighs the same amount as a pad of\npaper. One great thing about this release is that it has the same resolution\nas the iPad 2, which means that all apps\nthat are written for the full-sized iPad\nwill work perfectly for the iPad mini. It\nhas: two HD cameras (one on the front\nand back each), WiFi, 3G connectivity and a lightning connector. You can\nbuy a magnetic cover just like for the\nbig iPad, coming in 6 di\ufb00erent colours.\nhey are priced quite competitively at\n\u00a3270 to \u00a3530 for the di\ufb00erent models.\nSummary\nSo what does this keynote mean for\nyou? Probably not much, unless you\nare in the market for a new device. he\niMac and MacBook Pro look gorgeous,\nas does the iPad mini. he new big iPad,\nI believe, is a mistake on the part of Apple, as it makes a lot of consumers feel\nlike idiots right now. One question I do\nhave, and perhaps some of you will\nalso be thinking, is: \u201cAre Apple on a\ndownwardslope?\u201dheyappearnot\nto be acting as creatively or market leading anymore, but more\nreacting to market pressure.\nhis is sad to think about, as\nthe innovation is what made\nApple so special. With their\nedge looking increasingly\ndiminished at Cupertino,\nit could easily give way for\ncompetitors to take advantage\nand make the step up.\nMax Eggl looks at Apple\u2019s latest expected and unexpected products\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nA\nWindows 8 UK Launch\nJason Parmar\nTechnology Editor\nI arrived with a mate to what is a pretty\nstandard PC World Currys on Tottenham Court Road sharp at 9pm. Surprisingly, we found ourselves 66th in\nline to the UK launch of Windows 8.\nIt may sound odd, I mean, who in\ntheir right minds would queue for\nanything that isn\u2019t an Apple product?\nAnd, no, I\u2019m not a massive Microsoft\nfanboy, despite last week\u2019s edition of\nTech.\nWhat was \u201cspecial\u201d about this product launch, and the reason why I was\nwilling to spend 3 hours of my life\nqueuing, was the fact that declining\ntech giant Hewlett-Packard, HP, (and\nnot Microsoft) were offering super discounts on brand new Windows 8 laptops and a free pair of beats with each\npurchase to the first 300 customers in\nthe queue.\nThe company needed some good\npublicity after reporting a 31% reduce\nin profits Q2 this year and announcing\nlaying off of 29,000 employees. So\nwhat better way to boost their reputation and finances than by giving me\n\u00a31,200 of laptop for \u00a3650, plus two\ndouchebaggy Dr Dre Beats Solo HDs.\nI\u2019m not complaining, I got a good\ndeal, made a far bit of money and it\nwas actually pretty fun. But there was\none thing I couldn\u2019t work out, why on\nearth weren\u2019t there more people?\nThey gave out free doughnuts, hot\ndogs & drinks, entered us into competitions and even had a US magician\nthere to entertain us \u2013 yet still, despite\nthe online publicity, the feature in The\nMetro and more, there really weren\u2019t\nmany people willing to wait a couple\nof hours.\nMaybe it\u2019s because HP are seen as\nseriously uncool, and I can definitely\nsee why. Despite all the good value,\nthe event honestly kind of stunk of a\ndesperate company that is trying far\ntoo hard to be cool. Although I\u2019m grateful to HP, they really shouldn\u2019t be trying to create a similar hype to Apple.\nThey\u2019re just not cool enough, and they\nmake seriously mediocre electronics.\n17\nHoly shit,\nit\u2019s raining\noverpriced\nshiny Apple\nproducts!\nWin\n\n"

I certainly don\u2019t, but whenever I have a late start or on weekends\nI always invest the time into making\nthe truly delicious and traditional\nbreakfast.\nhe main and key ingredient in porridge is of the course the oats. After\nbeing harvested and cleaned, the oat\nare de-hulled by a machine, leaving\nthe groat. his is then heated to just\nover 100\u00baC to break down the lipol-ytic enzymes, which would spoil the\noats if left. From here the groats are\neither broken into pieces giving raw\noatmeal or steamed and rolled to\nmake rolled oats. hese \u2018rolled oats\u2019\nmake up practically all those found\nin the supermarket including: Quaker Oats, Jordans Organic Porridge\nOats, Scott\u2019s Porage Oats and also\nthe instant varieties such as Ready\nBrek. Despite this, porridge purists,\nand any self-respecting restaurant,\nwill always use the raw oatmeal, the\ncoarsest ground is known as pinhead\noatmeal. You should be able to buy\nthese at most whole foods shops and\nsometimes in Waitrose. Although\nthey take longer to cook, and require\nsoaking overnight, they produce a signi\ufb01cantly more textured and \ufb02avoursome porridge.\nAs for the liquid, you should use\nonly water when cooking the por-ridge, milk is usually added afterwards to form a cooling milky moat.\nAlthough many people use either\nmilk or a water/milk mix, I think it\nmasks the taste of the oats and in fact\nand leaves the porridge blander. Putting milk in porridge is much like putting sugar in tea; don\u2019t be a hooligan,\nleave it out.\nPorridgeing\nfor oats\nFOOD\nThe simplest chocolate tart ever!\nIngredients:\nFor the fillling:\n4 avocados\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n2/3 cup good quality cocoa\n1 cup maple syrup\n1/2 cup coconut oil\nFor the base:\n1 cup roasted almonds\n1 cup dates\n15\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nFood Editors: Carol Ann Cheah,\nSophia Goldberg, Yiango\nMavrocostanti\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nProcedure:\nYes... his is indeed the simplest\ntart; very healthy and it has a rich,\ndark chocolate taste.\nYou start by lightly greasing a\n9-inch pie pan.\nhen, use a blender to blend the\nalmonds and the dates.

Team Imperial (the\nso-called \u2018Mints\u2019) were con\ufb01dent of\nsuccess and arrived at the tournament\nready to rumble. here were 128 entrants for the individual tournament\nand 25 University teams in the Team\nChampionship.\nMax Chalmers \u2013 or \u201cChamlers\u201d as\nthe organisers misspelt it \u2013 was the\n\ufb01rst Imperial member to play in the\n\ufb01rst round of the individuals against\nan inexperienced Will Dean (York 2).\nChalmers won a cagey opener, however Will Dean levelled the scores after\nChalmers accidently potted the black\nin the second frame. In the \ufb01nal frame\nChalmers edged ahead and didn\u2019t look\nback to send Imperial into a winning\nstart.\nNext up was team captain Shyam \u201cSharm-el shaken, not stirred\u201d\nPankhania who brushed aside his opponent Jason Dalton (Captain, Nottingham Trent) 2-0 and then Elwin\n\u201cthe Whirlwind\u201d Carlos was given a\ntough test but some very competent\ntactical play saw him progress to the\nnext round after a 2-1 victory against\nDan Younger (Nottingham 3). Unfortunately Rob \u201cRob-ot\u201d Speller and Ed\n\u201che Grinder\u201d Graham met tough\nopposition and couldn\u2019t quite secure\nvictory. In the round of 64 Carlos and\nChalmers battled through with 2-1\nvictories. he Captain made it a round\nwithout casualties by securing a \u201cshyamtastic\u201d 2-0 win over Laurence Shaw\n(Nottingham 2). his set up exciting\nlast 32 encounters which were to be\nplayed later on Saturday.\nhe team were in high spirits for\nthe start of the Team Championships\ngroup stage in which Imperial were\ndrawn against Plymouth 1 and York\n2. his rubbed o\ufb00 in the \ufb01rst match\nas Imperial stormed to a 7-3 win over\nPlymouth. However, It looked like\ncomplacency was setting in against\nYork when, in the second and \ufb01nal\ngroup match, the team let a 4-1 lead\nslip back to 4-4. Cool heads were required from Chalmers and Speller in\nthe last two frames and they delivered\nto send Imperial into the last 16 as\ngroup toppers.\nIt was late in the day and a jubilant\nteam went for dinner at Nando\u2019s,\nwhich is somewhat of a Nottingham\ntradition for the team now. However,\nplay was not over yet as the organisers decided that the last 32 of the individuals should be played before the\nday was \ufb01nished. All players were certainly fatigued by this late stage in the\nday after being awake for nearing 20\nhours, but adrenaline kept them going\nlate into the night.\nCarlos had a tight match with Adam\nSykes (Manchester Metropolitan 1) in\nwhich he fought back to 2-2 after going two frames behind but was disappointed to lose 3-2. Pankhania met a\ntalented opponent in Todd Neilson\n(Manchester Metropolitan 1) who\nran out a 3-0 winner and Max faced\nBen Parslew (Manchester 1), Carlos\u2019s\nconqueror last year, and lost 3-1. Each\nImperial player had established their\nA-game at the business end of the\ntournament but they were simply out-classed.\nhe tournament entered Sunday\nand Imperial continued their pursuit\nof championship success with a last 16\nknockout match against the University\nof East Anglia 1 (UEA 1). A poor start\nleft the team trailing 4-0 and from that\npoint something special was required\nand Speller delivered it. he frame\nhe played resembled more a game of\nchess than a pool frame where he used\nhis genius to win it and keep Imperial\nalive at 4-1. Some dogged play from\nPankhania and Chalmers closed the\nscore to 5-3, however UEA secured a\n6-3 victory.\nAlthough Imperial had aspirations\nto win this year\u2019s tournament, it must\nbe said that they improved considerably from last year. he addition of \u201che\nGrinder\u201d brought solidity to the team\nand \u201cRob-ot\u201d provided the stroke of\ngenius that was missing last year. One\nthing is for sure, the \u2018Mints\u2019 reputation\nis growing and the team look forward\nto further improvement in the future.\nMany thanks should go to Nottingham University Snooker and Pool\nClub for organising the event.\nFor further details of events, as they\nhappen visit ICU Snooker online.\nSports Writer\nGaelic Football girls score at double header\nRuth Reynolds\nHow does a division 3 sport\u2019s team respond to the challenge of playing two\ndivision 1 standard teams back to back\nwithin the one day?\nSurely they wouldn\u2019t possibly dream\nof accepting and should redundantly\nassume their inevitable defeat? his is\nnot how ICGAC Ladies operate. So on\nSunday the 21st October the 9 aside\nteam made their way to T\u00edr Chonaill\nGael\u2019s pitch in Greenford \u2013 with the\nmantra \u201cah sure why not!\u201d at the front\nof their minds and love of the team at\nthe forefront of their hearts. No one\nknows what they are capable of until\nthey try, and with the majority of the\nteam having only been playing for a\nmatter of weeks, this was the perfect\nopportunity for us to try everything!\nSt.Alban\u2019s were \ufb01rst on the agenda,\nand \ufb01rst on the scoreboard as Imperial struggled through a rocky \ufb01rst\nhalf. his was all to be recti\ufb01ed however in the second half, by placing the\namazing Hester Corne in goals and a\nreshuffle of positions throughout the\n\ufb01eld enabled Imperial\u2019s true potential\nto shine through.\nWith Hester creating an impermeable barrier in the place of where\nour goals should have been and Ciara O\u2019 Callaghan swiftly ensuring the\nball made it safely up the pitch, Ami\nShirley and Ruth Reynolds got to work\non conversion. Captain Ruth managed\na point from play whilst newcomer\nAmi created a complete turn up for\nthe books in hammering home Imperial\u2019s \ufb01rst goal (3 points) in well over a\nyear! his from a girl who had literally\nbeen playing for 3 weeks! he hype,\npure shock and amazement created\nby this move by Woman of the Match\nAmi provided the catalyst for a vigor-ous, heartfelt and inspiring comeback\nfrom Imperial.\nDespite Imperial clearly dominating\nthe latter half of the game, regrettably\nSt.Alban\u2019s were the eventual victors on\nthe day, as the mistakes of the 1st half\nproved too much for even the most\nrejuvenated transformed and determined team to reconcile.\nIgnited by our performance in the\nlatter stages of the St.Alban\u2019s game;\nthe 5 minute break between games,\nthe ominous proposal of playing\nMary\u2019s (the most successful team of\nthe last two decades in British Universities Ladies\u2019 Gaelic football History!)\nand certain fatigue didn\u2019t even register\nwith the now steadfast Imperial team.\nhis self belief and dogged determination proved invaluable in creating a\nmuch more evenly contested game of\nfootball. he \ufb01rst half in particular was\nparticularly balanced as it was now\nMary\u2019s with their newly formed team\nwho were struggling to settle into the\ngame. he half time score was 0-3,\n0-1 to Mary\u2019s, obviously for a team of\ntheir standard this was very encouraging for ourselves. he experience and\nadmirable skill of the 8-time division\n1 champions did present itself in the\nsecond half of the game with Mary\u2019s\ngoing on to win the match.\nMary\u2019s left Greenford deserving\nwinners that Sunday, but Imperial left\nwith something else \u2013 an unquanti\ufb01able belief in what we are actually capable of.\nIn most sports, and I know Gaelic\nfootball is no di\ufb00erent you never give\nup until the \ufb01nal whistle. hat\u2019s precisely what ICGAC Ladies did and\nfrom this I know, we can go on to\nachieve anything we set our minds to\nin the future.

With a career spanning almost two decades now,\nthis singer/actress/dancer/performer has done it all, and shows o\ufb00 her polished skills in her latest \ufb01lm. As a housewife\nfacing that scary age of 40, Jung-hwa fantasises of once again jumping into the spotlight of a concert stage, an unful\ufb01lled\nambition she had to give up in her youth when she married her dim but dedicated husband, Jeong-min. A chance of a lifetime is o\ufb00ered, although the only trouble is, her husband, a down-to-earth and honest lawyer, is being groomed to enter\nthe political circles of Seoul; and having a singing/dancing politician\u2019s wife is very much frowned upon. An easy-going\nmix of comedy, drama and satirical portrayals of the Korean pop culture as well as its political games, here is a touching,\noftentimes funny and somewhat inspiring \ufb01lm that tells us we\u2019re never too young to pursue our dreams.\nEungyo\nAn intense story of lust, obsession and jealousy, it starts o\ufb00 with an intriguing premise: a 70-year-old, highly respected\nand successful poet and author (Park Hae-il) and his keen but not exactly gifted apprentice/butler (Kim Moo-yeul) one\nday stumble across a 17-year-old female high-school student Eun-gyo (Kim Go-eun), and face di\ufb03cultlies in their already\nrocky relationship. It\u2019s about odd people doing odd things which does provide some odd fascination in its frustratingly\nslow telling of a potentially powerful story. Hae-il, who himself is only 35 years old, never quite convinces in the scenes\nwhere he is supposed to be the seasoned, intelligent and deep-thinking professor. Excelling in her debut performance\nhowever is Go-eun, who perfectly captures the essence of these two men\u2019s contrasting, but equally potent, desires. It\u2019s\nessentially a love-triangle of mixed, complex intentions, and the outcome is an inevitably dense and depressing one.\nGabi\nAfter his wife, Empress Myeongseong, is brutally slain by the Japanese, King Gojong \ufb02ees to the Russian consulate and\nends up with a taste for co\ufb00ee, and sets his eyes \ufb01rmly on his personal barista who has the uncanny ability to brew the\nnew and mysterious drink from the west he\u2019s captivated by. But barista Tanya (Kim So-yeon) is in fact a coerced pawn in\na far sinister scheme hatched by a Japanese socialite, Sadako (Yoo Sun). Her intimate relationship with the King is to be\nused as her advantage here and her lover Ilyich (Joo Jin-mo) also \ufb01ts in in this widely convoluted, tonally confused period\ndrama that can\u2019t quite make up its mind about the story it wants to tell. here are no thrills, very little passion, which is\nwhy even the impressively mounted climax does very little to move. Plus this must be the worst, most poorly decorated\nand designed \ufb01lm that tries but fails to show a very intricate feel of 19th Century Korea.\nDeranged\nhere most certainly is something in the water \u2013 citizens of Korea start dying mysteriously. First they start eating lots.\nhen drinking lots. hen they die. Quite daringly for a health disaster \ufb01lm like this, the director gives away plenty of\nanswers in the \ufb01rst half. But it\u2019s only because this \ufb01lm has a lot more to tell. Focusing mainly on a single family, the story\nis mostly set around Jae-hyuk (Kim Myung-min) a lowly cubical worker in a pharmaceutical company, and his struggle\nagainst the clock and eventually, deadly conspiracy, to save his family who are showing the early symptoms of the condi-tion. It\u2019s incredibly fast-paced, with brief but adequate bouts of scienti\ufb01c jargon/explanation driving the plot forward.\nhe less you question the teeny tiny details and nitpick, the more you\u2019ll enjoy this tightly structured, solid e\ufb00ort that\nwants to be the South Korean version of Contagion.\nBlack Eagle (R2B: Return to Base)\nK-Pop superstar Rain (a.k.a Jung Ji-hoon) continues his career on the big screen as he takes over more or less the same\nrole Tom Cruise immortalised almost 30 years ago. As a hot-shot \ufb01ghter pilot who likes to show o\ufb00, Tae-hun (Ji-hoon)\ngets into a lot of trouble for making some dangerous choices. he \ufb01rst-half is spent on character building as well as o\ufb00beat, farce humour, whilst also \ufb01nding time for romance. he \ufb01nal segments concentrate on a surprise attack North\nKorea in\ufb02icts on the South, and a missing pilot who needs to be rescued. Shamelessly patriotic, naively simple, there is a\nlot of cheese in its awkward dialogue, and hardly any tension builds whilst the bad coup d\u2019etat soldiers in the North start\nplanning something malicious, but the action sequences are top-notch, \ufb01lmed incredibly with high octane energy over\nthe many tall buildings of Seoul , as large powerful aircrafts narrowly avoid disaster on many occasions.\nAs One Korea\nIn order to beat China, the dominant sports team when it comes to table tennis, the two Koreas decide to unify their\ntwo national teams and take on their biggest nemesis in the 41st World Table Tennis Championships in 1991. Of course,\nthis idea does not go down well with the players, as there are obvious culture clashes, personality di\ufb00erences and social\ndivide. And yet a special bond forms as time goes by, and they realise ultimately the only thing setting them apart is the\nbig military line dividing the two countries. he scenes showing the various table tennis matches are sensational, as each\ngrunt, each bounce, each serve and each smash is captured with so much convincing energy. And in the more human\naspects of the \ufb01lm, the two lead actresses (Ha Ji-won, Bae Doo-na) give it their absolute all, and succeed in creating a\npowerful \ufb01nale. Lots of di\ufb03cult subjects are glossed over, but as a sugary sweet, feel-good sports \ufb01lm, it\u2019s truly smashing.\n\n"

A lot of research is conducted at Imperial and sometimes this\nmay involve the use of animals. he\ncurrently policy on the Use of Animals in Research states that \u201canimals\nmay only be used in research programmes where their use is shown\nto be essential\u201d. his means that every possible method that does not\nuse animals is considered and only if\nthere are no other options, animals\nwill be used. Even when animals\nare used, this is kept to the smallest\nnumber of purpose-bred animals.\nWork involving animals can only\nstart once Imperial College\u2019s Ethical\nReview Process and the Home O\ufb03ce\nhas approved it. he policy adds that\n\u201canimals will never be used for trivial\npurposes and their health and wellbeing are given the highest priority\u201d.\nMinimizing the numbers of animals used in experiments is an\nachievement that can be commended from the National Centre for the\nPlacement, Re\ufb01nement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs).\nResearchers that make an e\ufb00ort to\nreduce the number of animals used\ncan win this award and PhD students\nfrom Imperial College have won this\nprize in previous years.\nIn the Government commissioned\nIpsos Mori poll, it was revealed that\nthere was a ten-percentage point\ndecrease in public support for scienti\ufb01c research involving animals\nsince 2010. Results showed that only\n66 percent of people agreed with\nthe statement \u2018I can accept animal\nexperimentation as long as it is for\nmedical research purposes\u2019 compared to the 76 percent in 2010.\nhis signi\ufb01cant decrease has stirred\na declaration to be formed on the\n\u2018openness of animal research\u2019. In October, Imperial College was proud to\nannounce that they had signed this\ndeclaration.\nProfessor Maggie Dallman, Principal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences commented saying \u2018he results of the Ipsos Mori poll suggest\nthat we need greater openness about\nwhy such research is important and\nwhat it involves. I hope that this declaration will give organisations and\nindividual scientists the con\ufb01dence\nto speak out with the support of the\nwider research community.\u201d\n\n"

Instead, doodle all lecture long and then send us your drawings to arts.felix@ic.ac.uk. This doodle is by Eleanor Vincent.\nWriter\nHotel du Rhone, Richard Hamilton\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n26\n\u201cOne of Britain\u2019s most in\ufb02uential artists\u201d, \u201cthe father of pop art\u201d, \u201cone of\nthe most innovative and audacious\nprintmakers of the age\u201d. hese phrases have all been used to describe the\nlate Richard Hamilton, creator of\nsuch famous collages as Just what is it\nthat makes today\u2019s homes so modern,\nso appealing?, widely considered as\nthe \ufb01rst ever example of pop art. You\ncan see, then, why I was so interested\nto explore his \ufb01nal works, currently\non display at the National Gallery.\nYou can also see, perhaps, why I\nwas so disappointed. Famous for the\npolitical engagement and social commentary in his art, the present collection was frustratingly abstract, and\nat points, self-indulgent. His fascination with interior spaces, and their\npossibility for perfection and regu-larity, was clear, and he cleverly used\ndi\ufb00erent perspectives, shadows, and\nrepetition to produce aesthetically\npleasing works of art. An image that\ndominates one piece of art is subtly\nduplicated in the background of an-other, for example, and throughout\nhis works stairs, columns and structures stretch out into in\ufb01nity with\nsatisfying uniformity. But without any\nmeaningful subject matter to \ufb02esh\nout these works, they become mere\nstudies in the powers of computers to\ncreate perfect, regular images. In one\ninterior, a naked woman stands holding a hoover in a \ufb02awlessly created,\ncomputer-modelled hotel room, all\nstraight lines and block colours and\nperfectly outlined furniture. Is Hamilton making a social comment on the\nobjecti\ufb01cation of women, their perceived imperfections, their domestic\nroles appointed them by a backward\nsociety? To be honest, I think he just\nreally likes naked women and he really likes hoovers.\nApparently Hamilton was profoundly moved by a short story by the\nauthor Honore de Balzac, in which\nan artist attempts to create an image of the perfect female nude, but,\naccording to his peers, fails, and thus\ncommits suicide. his idea, culminating in his un\ufb01nished trio of works,\nhe Balzac, is a recurring theme \u2013 at\nleast, naked women are.\nWe \ufb01nd them in bath tubs, in hotel lobbies, in a rather confusing image depicting the National Gallery\nitself. he nude female form, created by painting over digital photographs with total accuracy, appears\nin almost every piece in this small\nexhibition. heir positions are not\nsuggestive, their expressions are not\nemotive; they are just there. How can\na viewer have an emotional response\nto that?\nhe artist\u2019s insistence on using\nharsh, realistic photographs for the\nnudes, when even the faces of the\nwalls around them have been in some\nway changed by his creative input,\nrid the images of any essence of emo-tion, or self-expression, and I can\u2019t\nhelp wonder what it is he is trying to\nsay with them. He may have achieved\nhis desire of producing the perfect\nfemale nude\u2019, but at the expense of\nany true meaning or power to his art.\nWhen the rest of the National Gallery is so full of artists screaming out\nto express themselves, Hamilton\u2019s\nclean cut interiors and cleverly ordered compositions just don\u2019t cut the\nmustard.\nJust sit on the tumble dryer,\nit\u2019s not worth the trip to A&E\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nThe Biodiversity Crisis\nPhilippa Skett talks about why we need to act, fast\nI\nthe planet passing between the star\nand the detector. However, doing this\nrequires wading through vast quantities of data, and can take thousands\nand thousands of hours. Computer algorithms can help, but in many cases\nthe human eye is better at spotting the\ntell-tale signs of a planet.\nTo speed up this process, Planet\nHunters was set up in 2010, and now\nhas over 170,000 registered users who\nlook at data collected over the course\nFancy a change of pace? Go planet hunting\nChris Yates Writer\nmperial saw the advent of\nOneZoomTM\nthis month, a\nnavigable, online Tree of Life\nthat allows for easy exploration of mammals and how\nthey are related to each other geneti-cally. Using a click of a mouse, you\ncan scroll through millions of years of\nevolutionary hardship to come to the\norganisms it has shaped today, each\nsettled cosily on a little leaf.\nCreated by Life Sciences\u2019 own Dr\nJames Rosindell, it comes in a patchwork of colours, not for added aesthetics but to highlight just how\nat risk some of our mammals\nare from extinction. Ranging\nfrom a healthy green to a morbid red, each\nmammal\u2019s\nleaf is coloured depending on how at risk it is\nusing the IUCN Red List of hreat-ened Species. he tree appears almost\nas a patchwork quilt of red and green,\nwith the IUCN currently listing 25%\nof mammals being at risk, alongside\n41% of amphibians, 33% of reef building corals, 13% of birds, and 30% of\nconifers.\nFurthermore, it is estimated that\naround 50% of the total current species present now will be extinct in\nthe next 50 years. he\ncascading e\ufb00ects of\nspecies loss it may induce could lead\nto an even greater extinction rate than\ncould be possibly predicted. Some researchers are estimating that the present extinction rate is up to 100 times\ngreater than the natural extinction\nrate that occurs due to progression\nof mutations and general evolution\nalone.\n\u201che Biodiversity Crisis\u201d is the hot\nname for this 6th major extinction\nthat we are currently riding out \u2013 the\nother \ufb01ve being down to either extreme climate or biochemical shifts;\nthis one is being blamed on just one\nspecies and its actions: the Homo\nSapiens. As we push climate\nchange, deforestation, exploitation of \ufb01sheries, and intensive\nagriculture to their limits,\nit is the upsetting of\nthe ecosystems that\nis claiming the casualties \u2013 around 3\nspecies of a plant\nor animal are disappearing per hour.\nBut just what\nimplications such\na reduction could\nhave on populations and liveli-hoods, mainly in less\neconomically developed\ncountries, are di\ufb03cult to\ndetermine. Over-exploitation is causing these massive biodiversity reductions in tandem with the\npopulation booms these countries are\nexperiencing.\nhat is not to say they are at fault;\nit is easy to see how a father of \ufb01ve\nwould go about \ufb01shing enough to feed\nhis family without considering abstract biodiversity limitations, but in\nsome coastal communities up to 90%\nof the individuals are doing exactly the\nsame. With 1 in 4 \ufb01sheries worldwide\nnow depleted in biomass to a point\nwhere they are below a sustainable\nlevel, such exploitation is going to be\ndevastating in the long run when the\n\ufb01sheries run dry and communities\nlose their greatest commodity.\nIn many of these scenarios, it is the\nlack of education and resources at\nsuch hot spots that make it di\ufb03cult\nto implement sustainable resource\nacquisition, which would provide long\nterm bene\ufb01ts for both them and us. So\nhow does that bring us into the pic-ture? If you are not currently sitting in\nSAF, then no doubt conservation and\nresource management are not going\nto be on your mind, but there are still\nthings you can do to help the bigger\npicture.\nEndeavour to buy sustainable seafood (so avoid Blue\ufb01n Tuna or Northsea Cod) and only buy wood or wood-based products that boast the Forest\nStewardship Council (FSC) logo to\nwww.onezoom.org\nAn iconic image from Star Wars: Episode IV is the double sunset on Luke\nSkywalker\u2019s home planet Tatooine,\nwhich orbits a binary star. Not bad,\nbut how about a quadruple sunset?\nA recently discovered planet, PH1,\norbits a binary star which is itself\norbited by another binary star, the\n\ufb01rst example of this sort of system.\nhe planet\u2019s name is short for \u2018Planet\nHunters 1\u2019 and is named after a citi-zen-science project based at Yale University, which was responsible for the\ndiscovery.\nPlanet Hunters was set up to help\nresearchers get through the mountains of data being produced by NASA\u2019s Kepler spacecraft. he most common method of discovering planets\nis to look for dips in the amount of\nlight detected from a star caused by\nof a month to identify whether or not\na planet may be present. Kian Jek and\nRobert Gagliano did exactly that. Several other candidate planets have been\ndiscovered by the project, but PH1\nis the \ufb01rst to meet the strict criteria\nneeded to be o\ufb03cially classed as a\nplanet.\nPH1 has a radius of approximately\n6 times that of Earth and circles the\nclosest pair of stars every 137 days.\nhe other pair of stars lies approximately 90 billion miles from PH1.\nCitizen science approaches have\nbeen widely used over recent years,\nsuch as in the protein-folding game\nFoldit, in which players attempt to\nfold protein sequences to identify the\nbest possible structure. While computational power is increasing, in many\ncases the human touch is still needed,\nand these crowd-sourcing approaches\nare able to use people on a large-scale\nto power discovery.\nThe view from PH1, including its four suns\nDirk Terrell\nshow it is from a sustainable source.\nOr simply put more of those energy-saving tactics that were driven into\nus since primary school into action.\nWith climate change driving biodiversity loss too, cutting down on such effects can only bene\ufb01t the birds and the\nbees. Strive to use renewable energy,\nwalk instead of drive places or simply\nturn the lights o\ufb00 when you leave the\nroom.\nStill not convinced? Although it can\nbe di\ufb03cult to sympathise with a tiny\nlittle mushroom on the edge of disap-pearing, consider the bigger biodiversity blanket as a whole. Biodiversity\nas a network of individuals is what\nmakes an ecosystem; it is the lattice of\ninteractions between the species that\ndrives habitat construction, maintenance and regrowth. Remove a thread\nfrom the weave and it all begins to un-ravel, which is now accelerating right\nbefore our eyes.\nBiodiversity contributes to fertility\nand crop health, medical availability\nfrom plants, air quality, material quality and a general high quality of life.\nAs the species drop out, one by one,\nthe bu\ufb00er biodiversity is providing us\nis reducing bit by bit. So if you don\u2019t\nreally see the point of saving that\nmushroom, do it to save us; as long\nas you don\u2019t admit to doing it for selfish purposes, no one will ever need to\nknow.\n\n"

Well, that, or\nvideo games have become really dull\n5\nNews Editor: Aemun Reza\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nA marathon Council\nA \u00a3150 million partnership aiming\nto support the development of the\nnew Hammersmith-based Imperial\nWest Technology Campus has been\nannounced.\nDavid Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, revealed the\n\u00a3150 million partnership between\nImperial and property company\nVoreda, alongside six other university and business research partner-ships, on Wednesday 31 October.\nFollowing a bidding process that\ntook place over the summer, the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England has awarded \u00a335 million\nto contribute towards the development of the new campus\u2019 centrepiece\nResearch and Translation Hub.\nIn addition, a partnership between\nImperial and Voreda will result in an\nadditional \u00a390 million contribution\nfrom the investor. he remainder will\nbe funded by the College.\nhis project is one of the two biggest capital projects supported by the\ngovernment\u2019s Research Partnership\nInvestment Fund. David Willetts said\nof the research partnerships:\n\u201cIt is fantastic that our top businesses and top charities are queuing\nup to collaborate with our world-class universities. hey want to work\ntogether to deliver innovation, com-mercialisation and growth, which\nwill help make sure the UK competes\nand thrives in the global race.\u201d\nIn a statement released by the College, it is stated that the Research\nand Translation Hub \u201cwill serve the\nneeds of London\u2019s enterprise com-munity, expanding support for innovation drawn from Imperial and\nother leading universities\u201d and that it\nhas \u201can emphasis on the commercial-isation of research to bring bene\ufb01ts\nto society and the economy\u201d. Work\non the Hub is due to begin in January 2013.\nhis week\u2019s announcement follows\nthe recent granting of planning permission for the new seven acre Imperial West campus, situated in the\nBBC\u2019s former Woodlands site.\nAs previous reported in Felix, there\nhave been some concerns raised by\nlocal residents of the surrounding\narea, with the St Helen\u2019s Residents\u2019\nAssociation opposing a potential increase in tra\ufb03c to the area and possible overshadowing caused by the\ncampus\u2019 110m tall residential tower.\nIn a statement, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions,\nPresident and Rector of Imperial\nCollege, said of the planned Hub:\n\u201cWith space for 50 spin-out com-panies, we will be able to support innovation drawn from Imperial and\nother leading institutions at a scale\nunprecedented in London and the\nUK generally. We expect the Hub to\nbecome a magnet for businesses and\nuniversities in the UK and beyond,\nkeen to \ufb01nd a foothold in London\nand to tap into Imperial\u2019s world-lead-ing expertise in science, engineering,\nmedicine and business. [...] It\u2019s now\ngame on to realise the potential of\nImperial West.\u201d\nMatt Colvin Reporter\n\u00a3150 million partnership for Imperial\ncontinued from the front page\n>>\nwho were only recently elected, had to\nmake. It had previously been questioned,\nby the Court, as to whether it was too\nsoon for such an important vote to occur,\nand if they realistically had had enough\ntime to actually look over the proposals\nin full. It was argued that the time frame\nwas too short, and that there was no way\nthat people would have sufficient time to\nstudy the new and old Constitutions in\nfull (especially considering the ever pre-sent, ominous Imperial work load). The\nretort by Beaumont was that the papers\nwere all widely available online and were\ncirculated to all candidates, as well as the\nemails encouraging everyone to read\nthem. Beaumont said that everyone had\nhad ample time. The concern that the\nadditions made over the weekend were\nnot properly seen were also raised.\nCouncil Chair, Michael Foster, stated\nthat the Council\u2019s discussion would be\nrun by the following procedure: a member of the floor posing a question and\nthen receiving an answer from Beaumont. The reasoning given was that it\nwas assumed that everyone had read\neverything beforehand and therefore\nseen both sides of the arguments. However, Felix has found out that there are\nmembers of Council who did not read\neverything beforehand. This decision\nwas questioned by the Court, with the\nobjection swiftly brushed aside.\nThere were a few contentious points in\nthe new Constitution. The fact that the\nUnion now is able to discipline members\nfor bringing the Union into disrepute\nwas one. This was brought up at Council,\nand the response was that it was already\nin the College Ordinances. The addition\nwas said to be nothing new due to this,\nwith no new powers given to anyone.\nIt was not actually defined what action could be considered to be bringing\nthe Union into disrepute. An individual\naccusing the Union of acting in an untoward manner could not be punished\nif the matter was found to be true: those\nparticipating in said action would be\ndisciplined.\nDiving deeper into the matter to see\nhow this could affect anyone, it is a copy\nand pasting from the College\u2019s Disciplinary Ordinances. In the College\u2019s Ordinances, which stood before the current,\nnew Constitution, anyone bringing the\nname of the College into disrepute can\nbe disciplined by the College. As stated\nin Ordinance D8 point 29. It states in\nanother part of the Disciplinary Section\nthat any matters to do with the Union\nare dealt with by the Union President.\nThe Union therefore will discipline an\nindividual instead of College. This has\nhappened as recently as the PhysSoc in-cident. This can be seen as a positive for\nstudents, as the discipline will not be on a\npermanent College record. The negative\nis that the disrepute rule does now have\nthe potential to discourage those wanting to criticise from doing so. Although\nthose reporting the criticism are protected from discipline, the person saying\nsomething negative could still possibly\nbe at risk. The point of what can be construed as disrepute has not been cleared\nup yet, although it is likely to be the same\nas found in the College Ordinances. The\ndecision would, however, not be made by\njust one individual. There is also a potential loophole, in that one could just opt\nout of being in the Union\nThe Sabbatical Officers are now on\nthe Trustee Board, as well as the elected\nand, now, appointed Student Trustees.\nThis was argued by the Court to be\nhanding power to the Sabbatical Team\nand making them more powerful. The\nCourt opinion, which was presented in\nwritten form, and also in spoken form.\nThe Court said that the Sabbaticals could\nignore decisions at Council and use the\nTrustee Board as a way to force through\nunpopular policies that they want to cre-ate. Beaumont reiterated that the Sabbs\nwere the \u201cleast powerful in the country\u201d\nand that the \u201cPresident has too much\npower\u201d, also stating that the other Sabbs\ndid not have a vote, and therefore not a\nproper voice, on the Trustee Board. He\nalso said that any Trustee could be recalled and that their can be a motion of\nno confidence against a Sabb found to go\nagainst Council. Although motions of no\nconfidence are very rare.\nIt was also put forward by Court that\nthere is a danger that the changes could\nbe misinterpreted by future generations,\nsaying: \u201cthere is a real risk that it could\nbe misinterpreted what is meant\u201d. Beaumont claimed that the current document\nis much clearer.\nWhen discussing finance, which, due\nto the money being crucial to how the\nUnion is run, is very vital, Court put\nforward the opinion that it seems to be\nthat it is not sure who and what approves\nthe money. Saying that the Trustee Board\nnow has too much say. Beaumont said\nthat it was still the Executive Committee,\nas it was before, who decided the budget\nand can take it to the Trustee Board. He\nadded that before the Executive Committee could overturn the decision of\nthe Trustee Board and undermine them,\neven though the Trustees are legally\nheld responsible for losses. Beaumont\nsaid that this was wrong and that is has\nbeen cleared up, but that the budget\nstill must be decided by students. Beaumont argued that the changes \u201cremoves\nbureaucracy\u201d.\nLosses such as the Summer Ball 2011\nwere sighted as reasons for the changes\nand the need for the losses not to be\nmade again. Court argued that it should\nbe those responsible for the losses, not\nthe systems, that should be blamed for\nthem.\nThe Student Trustees and two other\nTrustees were also present. The Chair of\nthe Trustee Board, Julia Higgins, and Lay\nTrustee Janet Rogan were in attendance.\nThey gave their point of view on the\nchanges. Both citing the \u201cdifferent view\u201d\nthat they had, due to serving for longer.\nThey both praised the idea of changing\nthe Constitution and said that it was confusing beforehand. Higgins said the \u201csystems weren\u2019t fit for purpose\u201d. Although\nthe only big change that is admitted to be\nan outright change is getting rid of Court\nand creating a Sub-Committee of the\nTrustee Board.\nAn interesting point to note is that\nCourt did not appear on the website\nwhen it was relaunched, following the\nserver being corrupted while backing up\nover summer.\nBeaumont stated that: \u201cI\u2019m obviously\nvery happy that Council voted it through\nunanimously, but this is just the first\nstage of many\u201d. Saying that the Constitution and Bye-Laws should have many\nstages to approval as they are important.\nThe new Constitution now has to go\nto the Trustee Board (although, as stated,\nkey members were there: it is therefore\nextremely unlikely that those praising\nthe changes would reverse the decision),\nand then to College Council.\nThe Constitution can be found online, as\ncan Council documents.\nImperial College London\nThe X-Factor\njudging panel really has changed\n\n"

We descended on\nto AirKix in Milton Keynes in force,\na whole 24 of us, and everybody got\na little over two minutes in the tun-nel, which is sort of equivalent to the\nfreefall time of three skydives. People spent most of that time grinning\nwildly, as spittle dribbled up their\nface! Everyone managed to get sta-ble, belly down and arms out, with\nthe help of the instructor and when\nthe instructor felt they were ready,\npeople got to \ufb02oat around the tunnel on their own. here\u2019s no talking\nin the tunnel as the wind whips the\nwords from your mouth (both physi-As term really kicks o\ufb00 and we all start\ngetting stuck in our routine, ICDC\nare coming at you with more projects\nand talks than you can shake multiple\nsticks at to get into a creative state of\nmind.\nFresh from having the heads of Genesis bikes judging and aiding our successful last project looking into cycling\nand the city of London, we found ideas\nranging from simple e\ufb00ective gadgets\nto reorganising tra\ufb03c systems, this\nreally showed how ICDC is a brilliant\nplatform for us to use our technical expertise within the design realm allowing quick development time and detailed concepts to emerge in just under\n4 hours!

He has just \ufb01nished\nbuilding the world\u2019s largest timber residential structure in Shoreditch and is\nnow leading the way for cheap and\ngreen architecture across the globe.\nWe now look onto the coming weeks\nand we have just launched our second project \u2018Interactive City\u2019 which\nhas been planned in collusion with\nAndrew Shoben (TEDX Speaker and\nworld\u2019s only professor in public art,\nso no big deal..) who is behind www.\ngreyworld.org.

    "content": "Pandering to every whim\nMax Eggl eats shoots and leaves\nveryone has heard of,\nsco\ufb00ed at, ridiculed,\nplayed, dominated (cross\nout the ones that do not\napply to you) World of\nWarcraft. For those of you who chose\nthe two latter choices, this is the article for you. For all the rest, you can\nstop judging, get yourselves an account and then read this article!\nSo now to set the scene. After the release of Cataclysm, many players (in-cluding yours truly) were a bit disappointed and annoyed at Blizzard. his\nmove was motivated by the attempt to\nhave new players join the 10 million\nstrong online community, however\nit did frustrate those die-hard vanilla\nplayers, who had expected more from\nthe expansion. Once you had killed\nDeathwing (I currently stand at 19),\nthere was not much to do apart from\nTwinking.\nMists of Pandaria was Blizzards way\nof saying sorry and thus a lot of pressure was mounting on MoP to deliver.\nReports from the beta did nothing to\nstay the hype and \ufb01nally on the 25th\nof September, MoP was released, allowing the average player to explore\nPandaria, level up to 90, play as pandas and monks, and even more. So did\nMoP really live up to the expectation?\nIn the humble opinion of this writer\n(level 90 Pala), I must say, YES. From\nthe o\ufb00, Mists of Pandaria was a suc-cess. I played from day one, and, I\nmust say, I felt like I always had something to do and never was it tedious.\nAlso, my opinion was shared by many\nothers, who I questioned (mostly\nGuildies). Usually the verdict included\nthe words \u201camazing\u201d, \u201cincredible\u201d or\nany other expletive that you can think\nof. For all you raid leaders, guild members and newbies, here is your guide\nto the main points of MoP and how\nthey will enrich your gaming experi-ence.\nSo the \ufb01rst port of call is the new\ncontinent, Pandaria. Pandaria is not\nactually a land mass, but in fact a giant\ntortoise. From the shape on the map\nyou can vaguely make out its contours.\nSeven regions will lead you through\nyour quest to gain max level. Most\nof these are absolutely stunning (my\nfavourite is the valley of four winds),\nwhich just highlights all that blizzard\nput into this expansion. Cherry trees,\nmountains and typical Chinese architecture dot the areas that you have to\ntraverse, which just adds to that exotic\ne\ufb00ect. Another positive is that you\ncan\u2019t just \ufb02y through the continent.\n\u2018You CANNOT \ufb02y?\u2019 I hear you scream.\n\u2018hat\u2019s a positive?\u2019 you wonder. Well\njust think about it, in Cataclysm, most\nof the new regions were quickly ex-plored, but not actually seen. With\nyour trusty \ufb02ying mount, you just \ufb02ew\neasily over Mount Hyjal, Uldum, etc.\nhe big question is, do you remember\nANYTHING of those areas? I don\u2019t.\nHowever I can recall with vivid detail\nmy journey on my chopper through\nthe Jade Forest. Not only did I see\nmore than I would have \ufb02ying, it was\nalso signi\ufb01cantly more di\ufb03cult and\nconsequently more impressionable.\nFor all those who can\u2019t live without\ntheir \ufb02ying mounts, don\u2019t despair, just\nmake it to level 90 and then you can \ufb02y\nto your hearts content. One con that\nis not really a con, but personal prefer-ence, is the that some regions did feel\nrepetitive, but that may just be me.\nhe quests are, for the most part,\nextremely fun, although you do get a\nhealthy mix of the \u201ckill bad guy, get\nloot\u201d type quest that we all know and\njust grind through. he fun quests include helping to brew a barrel of beer\n(the ingredients were not so tasty)\nas well as in\ufb01ltrating a brewery and\nsucker-punching various demons. I\ndid \ufb01nd them quite enjoyable, and\nthere were enough new elements to\nstop me from getting bored. In fact I\nwould have been quite \ufb01ne with just\nquesting to level up.\nHowever I did do the dungeons,\nwhich not only helped me gain XP\nthat much faster, they were genuinely FUN. I mean, who doesn\u2019t like the\nsight of your \ufb01ne companions bar\ufb01ng\ntheir guts out into buckets while evading huge streams of alcoholic beverages and healing/DPSing/tanking at\nthe same time (I couldn\u2019t stop laugh-ing... until I was the one heaving)?\nAnother aspect was that you actually,\ngenuinely, hate some of the bosses in\nthe dungeons, most notably the \u201cSha\u201d.\nhese are black masses of emotions\ncome to life usually anger or hate.\nhese things look, for a lack of a better word, evil (yes I am aware of the\nclich\u00e9), but I actually felt like a better\nperson when I had \ufb01nally destroyed\none of those things. All in all, I enjoyed\nthe dungeons a lot and will be doing\nthem many more times.\nNow about the new class. When\nBlizzard \ufb01rst announced that a new\npanda race would be introduced, most\ncritics laughed about this decision.\nI however applaud it, as not only are\nthe Pandaren ass-kicking cool, they\nalso provide some comic relief for all\nthose of us who take ourselves too seriously (myself included). hey come\nin multiple varieties and colours, with\nthe females even getting a tail. hey\nhave several abilities having to do with\ncooking, which will probably be ner-fed in the next update as right now it\u2019s\noverpowered. Also for all those wanting to start a new Pandaren char, you\nget a bonus on your rested XP and\nthis makes levelling quite a bit more\ne\ufb03cient. he biggest thing with the\nPandaren race is the fact that you can\nchoose to be an ally or a horde. Now\nthat is deep, think about it, you have\nthe choice to become an amazing ally\nor a horrible horde. Seriously now\nthough, it is quite cool as this means\nthat you can see pandas on both sides\nof the war!\nhe monk is... epic! hey are fun to\nplay and if you play a Pandaren Monk,\nit just adds to the whole epicness.\nMost of the variations you can play\nof the monk, are also quite creative,\nincluding: Brewmaster (Tank), Mistweaver (Heal) and Windwalker (DPS)\nFor me, who already plays a Pala, I love\nclasses that can perform many di\ufb00erent roles and thus the monk is a cool\naddition to the hybrid classes. Not\nonly that, but all di\ufb00erent specs have\nthis really awe-inspiring kung-fu \ufb01ghting style which is really fun not only to\nplay, but also just to watch. Combining this with the racial XP bonus of the\nPandaren, expect many monks in your\nraid in the foreseeable future.\nNow for all you casual gamers, or for\nthe times between your raids. here\nis the new pet battle system. Stolen\nshamelessly from Pok\u00e9mon, it still is\nan amazing addition. I actually had a\nhard time deciding if I wanted to level\nup, or my gorloc pet. So most of the\npets that you already own are battle\nready and you can use these to \ufb01ght\nother wild pets, speci\ufb01c trainers and\nother players. You can also catch these\nwild pets, which makes it so much\nmore easy to collect those pet related\nachievements and titles. he pets also\nhave di\ufb00erent types, and these have\nstrengths/weaknesses against other\ntypes. hus a certain element of strategy is included in the battles. All in all,\nsince I really enjoyed Pok\u00e9mon as a\nchild, this is just a welcome addition\nto WoW.\nAnother rip-o\ufb00 that Blizzard has\nincorporated into MoP is a Farmville\none. Yes, my dear readers, you can\nnow farm your own crops, rip out\nweeds, water your own plants and\nthen harvest them to use in your various cooking recipes. It takes quite a\nwhile to build up a substantial farm to\nactually spend time in, but once you\ndo it is quite rewarding. his also has\na positive knock-on e\ufb00ect on the secondary profession of cooking (which\nalso has been modi\ufb01ed quite heavily,\nnow being split into 4 categories, e.g.\nmaster of the Wok), allowing for you\nto level more quickly and have ingredients easily at hand. For all of those\nwith a business sense, the farming\nwas a really good money maker, as\nyou could sell produce in the auction\nhouses, for incredibly in\ufb02ated prices. I\ndo not know if this is still the case, but\nmaybe you wanna check it out!\nhere is so much more that I could\nsay, including the talent tree, the new\n\ufb02ying mounts, the new cities, etc. But\nI am afraid my fellow games writers\nwould appreciate me not hogging the\nwhole issue with my ramblings. I must\nsay this is one of the best expansions\nof WoW, if not THE best, that Blizzard\nhas released and it is really worth the\nmoney! C\u2019mon what are you waiting\nfor?\nE\nWAA WAA WAA I HATE COMPETITION. LET\u2019S SUE THEM YEAH\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n28\nBreathe deep.

    "content": "BOOKS Books Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n38\nMitchell\u2019s Cloud Atlas\nloud Atlas, to refresh\nyour memory, is David\nMitchell\u2019s 2004 Booker\nshort-listed novel whose\n\ufb01lm adaptation is due\nto release in the U.K early next year.\nhe novel is, to put it mildly, a complex book, composed of six di\ufb00erent\nnarratives spanning time and space,\nfrom the 19th century South Paci\ufb01c\nto early 30s Europe, late 70s America,\nearly 21st century Britain, near future\ndystopian Korea and post apocalyptic distant future Hawaii. Each story\nends abruptly where the next picks\nup and once the reader reaches forward in time to the sixth narrative he\nis pushed back through the ages while\neach story is neatly resolved, ending\nwhere the book begins.\nIt is testament to Mitchell\u2019s skill as a\nstoryteller that once you \ufb01nish Cloud\nAtlas you\u2019re pleasantly surprised that\nit was such an easy read. It helps that\nthe book is inhabited by at least six\nradically di\ufb00erent protagonists \u2013 the\ncredulous lawyer Adam Ewing, an\noversexed and wily amanuensis Robert\nFrobisher, a driven heroine reporter\nLuisa Rey, English publisher Timothy\nCavendish, clone and future martyr\nSomni 451, and the distrustful primitive Zachry. Not all of these characters\nare particularly likeable but they are\nall remarkably well formed given the\nlimited space accorded to each.\nhe tale begins with excerpts from\nthe journals of Adam Ewing, a lawyer\ncrossing the Paci\ufb01c in 1850, describing his encounters with savage Maoris, di\ufb00erently savage missionaries\nand his befriending of the unsavory\nDr. Goose. he second story takes the\nform of letters from a Robert Frobisher, a musical talent, to his lover Rupert\nSixsmith. Frobisher recounts how he\nconvinced an old genius to take him\non as an amanuensis and proceeded to\nbed the dying man\u2019s wife and daughter.\nSixsmith appears in the next narrative\nas a nuclear scientist who helps a tenacious journalist, Luisa Rey uncover\na dangerous nuclear conspiracy. In\nthe next part Luisa Rey\u2019s story \ufb01nds\nitself in the hands of a moderately\nsuccessful publisher called Timothy\nCavendish who through a series of\nunfortunate events is imprisoned in\na nursing home. A slightly longer leap\nforward in time brings the reader to\nstory number \ufb01ve, an account of an interview of captured clone Somni 451\nwho attempted rebellion against the\nrather Orwellian totalitarian state that\nexploited her kind. he central story,\nand the only one not split in two, is\nthat of a tribesman called Zachry living in a village after a doomsday event\ncalled the Fall.\nhese six tales are all connected to\nDevang Mehta talks about a fascinating multi-layered novel\nC\nthe next via physical links as well as\nthe presence of an identical \u201cbirthmark\u201d on all the protagonists. he\n\u201cbirthmark\u201d in Mitchell\u2019s words is \u201ca\nsymbol really of the universality of human nature\u201d.\nReading each story individually (and\nespecially the ones set in our future) it\nbecomes obvious that the author has\nnot written anything truly original.\nhematically, the stories \ufb01t well within\nestablished science \ufb01ction canon but\nit is the narration, the versatility of\nthe prose, the e\ufb00ortless stylistic variation and the perfectly nested structure\nthat set this book apart. his book is a\nmust-read, if only to enjoy the writing.\nExplaining the title, Mitchell says,\n\u201c\u2026 the cloud refers to the ever changing manifestations of the Atlas, which\nis the \ufb01xed human nature which is\nalways thus and ever shall be. So the\nbook\u2019s theme is predacity, the way individuals prey on individuals, groups\non groups, nations on nations, tribes\non tribes.\u201d his \u201cpredacity\u201d and its recurrence through time and through\ndiverse human societies is pretty evident in the book and Mitchell\u2019s rather\npessimistic view of human nature also\ncomes across equally well. Almost\neach tale shows a majority of human\n\ufb01gures as corrupt, cruel, manipulative and stupid \u2013 the whole gamut of\nnegative traits. While his protagonists\nexhibit some redeeming features, human society as a whole is consigned to\na dystopian past, present and future.\nhe theme of the book emerges to be\nboth an acceptance and a subtle critique of the Darwinian \u201csurvival of the\n\ufb01ttest\u201d paradigm.\nAnd then in the very last pages of\nthe book Mitchell o\ufb00ers us a ray of\nhope. hrough an impassioned and\nrather preachy soliloquy, Adam Ewing warns, \u201cBelief is both prize &\nbattle\ufb01eld, within the mind & in the\nmind\u2019s mirror, the world. If we believe\nhumanity is a ladder of tribes, a colosseum of confrontation, exploitation\n& bestiality, such a humanity is surely\nbrought into being\u2026 If we believe that\nhumanity may transcend tooth & claw,\nif we believe divers races & creeds can\nshare this world as peaceably as the\norphans share their candlenut tree, if\nwe believe leaders must be just, violence muzzled, power accountable &\nthe riches of the Earth & its Oceans\nshared equitably, such a world will\ncome to pass.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s contention is\nthat without a fundamental change in\nhuman nature, mankind is doomed to\nend back in the primitive jungle from\nwhence it evolved. Although History\nwould argue against this proposition\n(and successfully in my opinion),\nCloud Atlas does make its point forcefully and poignantly.\n\n"

    "content": "The Cribs are back on top\nMUSIC\nBE SURE NOT TO MISS\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter,\n\u00cd\u00f1igo Martinez de Rituerto\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\n37\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nAMS album of the week\nTitus Andronicus\u2019 first two albums are both fantastic. An eclectic brand of\nlo-fi punk done with furious passion and intelligence. A key theme of Titus Andronicus\u2019 lyrics is nihilism. You can look at the first two albums as the first two\nsteps in accepting nihilism. First you get really pissed off, and then you have a\nbit of a cry. If we take Local Business, Titus Andronicus\u2019 third album, as an extension of this, it turns out that the next step of coming to terms with nihilism is to\nbecome the Gaslight Anthem.\nMy reviews generally take the form introduction, positives, negatives and\nconclusion. Sadly I have absolutely nothing good to say about this album so I\u2019m\ndiving straight into the negatives. It\u2019s straight up shit. The first album makes you\nwant to get fucked up and throw yourself around a sweaty venue, the second\nmakes you want to get fucked up and sit in a corner and sob. This one makes\nme want to go to the pub and have a quiet shandy, specifically without this on\nin the background. Patrick Stickles used to write clever lyrics with a knack for\nblack humour and a heavy sense of irony. Now we\u2019re treated to the lines \u201cyour\ndick\u2019s too short to fuck the world\u201d, \u201cfeeling like we live on diarrhoea planet\u201d and\na whole fucking song about being an electric man (he has everything but an electric van). The songs used to slot together whilst all having their own aesthetic.\nOn this album the brief forays out of bad Hold Steady songs are just bizarre. The\nlast few minutes of \u2018My Eating Disorder\u2019 is the sort of thing you imagine Kyuss\nmight have found after a recording session where they took the stoner in stoner\nrock a bit too far. \u2018Tried to Quit Smoking\u2019 uses all the worst parts of The Pogues\nfor nearly 10 minutes.\nIt\u2019s clumsy, it\u2019s crass and it\u2019s certainly not clever. It\u2019s bizarre that a band could go\nfrom being so vitriolic to being so unbelievably bland. It\u2019s like they\u2019re happy now,\nwhich might be great for them but it\u2019s really ruined the band. This album sounds\nlike Tenacious D ironically parodying Bruce Springsteen as Titus Andronicus.\nItisofcourseentirelypossiblethatthatiswhattheyweregoingfor,inwhichcase\nthey are all cunts. \u2013 Stuart Masson\nTitus Andronicus: LocalBusiness\nhe Cribs are a band of many contradic-tions. hey are a band who pack their\nshows with huge choruses that bring\nthe roof down whilst also getting long\npoetic spoken word pieces into one of\ntheir songs; they are a band who manage\nto satisfy those fans who want the more\nvisceral punk rock side of the spectrum\nwhilst also inspiring devotion in pop\npurists; they are a band who have never\nreally belonged to any trends but, with\nthe release of their latest album In the\nBelly of the Brazen Bull, also seem as relevant as ever. Despite these many con-tradictions, or perhaps because of them,\nit seems that the Cribs are as vital as they\nhave ever been before.\nhe Wake\ufb01eld boys are the type to\ninspire true devotion in their fans, and\ntonight was not to be any di\ufb00erent. he\nQ Awards show at the HMV Forum in\nKentish Town was a touch on the expensive side in my view, with tickets coming\nin at around \u00a330 each, but the Cribs\u2019 loyal following turned up in droves to watch\ntheir favourite indie heroes. Edywn Collins (of Orange Juice fame) started the\nnight o\ufb00 in \ufb01ne form. \u2018Losing Sleep\u2019 and\n\u2018 A Girl Like You\u2019 went down very well\nbut it was \u2018Rip It Up\u2019 which really blew\nme away. It is an extremely simple song\ncontaining a maximum of about twenty\nwords but it is a piece of pop perfection.\nYou can tell that Edwyn Collins is a complete don because he manages to include\na cheeky saxophone solo without making me want to claw out my own ears.\nAlso, anyone who can look cool with a\ncane is okay in my book. Kudos to you\nsir!\nhe Cribs bounded on stage with total authority, it was clear they knew that\ntonight was going to be a great show. I\nfelt that around the time of Ignore the\nIgnorant (largely ignored in the setlist to-night) the band had become somewhat\nof a homage to their former selves but\nnow with the release of In the Belly\u2026 it\nwas clear that they had recovered that\nessence which made them such a thrilling proposition. With \ufb01ve albums worth\nof material to choose from there was not\nspace for any lulls tonight, only electrifying pop hits fuelling mayhem on the\ndance\ufb02oor. It has been so long since I\nhave seen so many crowdsurfers at a\nLondon show, so often a city plagued by\nchin strokers and plaid-shirt bloggers;\ntonight was made to bring hipster London out of its esoteric coma with a blast\nofindierockandawholelotofinfectious\nenergy.\nAt a time when so many people are\nwhining that guitar music is dead, I\nwould refer these idiots to the fantastic trio of songs near the beginning of\nthe set which really set the tone for the\nevening: \u2018Our Bovine Public\u2019\n, \u2018Glitters\nLike Gold\u2019 and \u2018Back to the Bolthole\u2019\n.\nhe crowd was going absolutely ballistic for the massive choruses and even\nsang every word back of a lesser known\nb-side. When \u2018I\u2019m a Realist\u2019 started up,\nthe crowd erupted into further frenzy\nand the band lapped up the adoration\ncoming their way. One of the highlights\nof the night was the spoken word epic of\n\u2018Be Safe\u2019\n. As an album track it is a strange\nproposition but live it makes perfect\nsense; the slow burning anger of Lee\nRanaldo (from Sonic Youth) backed by\nanepicthrashofguitars.Iwascaptivated\nand it was only slightly marred by technical disruptions with the video feed but\nthe song was so powerful that no-one\nseemed to care.\nhe night came to a climax with some\nof bigger hits in the Cribs\u2019 armoury. \u2018Hey\nScenesters\u2019 is always a joy to watch and\n\u2018Men\u2019sNeeds\u2019wasarallyingcryforeveryone to throw their ridiculously expensive\npints in the air. he relatively newer song\n\u2018Chi Town\u2019 had an amazing energy about\nit; Ryan\u2019s punk leanings asserting themselves on this balls-out number which\ncould have come straight out of the Ramones\u2019 catalogue (and this is perhaps a\nperfect complement to give.) By the end\nof the night Ryan was ended up dressed\nin various bits of clothing thrown to him\nby the audience including some sort of\nsweat doused cape. He exclaimed to that\ncrowd that he didn\u2019t mind sharing bodily\n\ufb02uidswiththembecausethatisthebond\nwhich they had. his image of him stood\nwailing his heart out dressed in disgusting sweaty rags embodied everything\nI have come to love about the Cribs;\nthey don\u2019t care about looking cool, they\nonly want to make amazing pop songs\nfor people to jump around to and, most\nsigni\ufb01cantly, they were having so much\nfun that I wanted to be in their gang.

No not you!\nKeep drumming!\nATP bring a fantastic show to\nWest London (Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire) on the 28th November when\nthey hit us not only with the incredibly energetic Dirty Three, lead by\nbig-bearded Australian mentalist\nWarren Ellis, but also with indescribable (seriously, I\u2019m not sure\nhow to describe even their studio\nstuff) Bristol trio Zun Zun Egui.\nFor those not currently aware,\nDirty Three are, I guess essentially,\na post-rock trio with a drummer,\nbassist/guitarist and a crazy man\nfull of ridiculous anecdotes who\nplays violin. I would describe their\nstudio stuff as generally morose but\nlive it\u2019s a completely different ani-mal: a huge amount of energy runs\nthrough every performance, perhaps emphasised by Warren Ellis\u2019s\nstage antics.\nEven if you have absolutely no interest currently in their music you\nshould definitely check this out: the\nlive show is absolutely incredible as\na musical and theatrical experience,\npossibly one of the best in the world\ntoday.\n\u2013 Ross Gray\nDirty Three/Zun Zun Egui\nWho said that London is the only\nplace which knows how to put on\ngreat shows? The very first Fear of\nFiction Festival is here to show you\nthat Bristol is an amazing place for\nup and coming bands. One of the\nbands to definitely watch out for\nare headliners Toy whose brand of\nreverb drenched shoe-gazey pop is\nsure to be a massive hit. I know this\nis lazy journalism but the similarities with The Horrors are hard to\nplay down.\nLabyrinth Ear play the sort of\nstripped down electro that most\nbloggers would wet their cool East\nLondon pants for. DZ Deathrays,\nthe totally incredible metal band\nthat it is okay for hipsters to like,\nhave just been added to the bill.\nAnd to top all of that off Egyptian\nHip Hop, whose album was given a\nglowing review last week in these\nvery pages, look set to recapture the\nhype they had a few years ago with\ntheir set.\nThis one day festival is all happening in Stokes Croft in Bristol\nwith tickets being sold from \u00a315. It\nis a great opportunity to check out\nFear of Fiction Festival\nsome of the best alternative bars\nand venues in the area. Felix Music\nwill hopefully be there so take a day\ntrip out of the big smoke for a day\nand have an amazing time.\n\u2013 Mark England\nStoke\u2019s Croft is the best\nplace for tribal noise,\nhipsters and graffiti of\nskulls\n\n"

Music being played in the\nWhite House is a long standing tradi-tion, dating back to ever since the Marine Band were invited to perform in\nthe Executive Suite for President John\nAdams on New Year\u2019s Day 1801. Fast\nforward to 20 January 2009, President\nBarack Obama was elected and that\nevening as part of the Inauguration\nthe Wynton Marsalis Quintet played\nat the White House for the new President and 100 of his guests. Since then,\nthe on-going White House music series has zig-zagged across the musical spectrum inviting a wide array of\nartists to perform at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue including Earth, Wind\nand Fire, Stevie Wonder and Ziggy\nMarley.\nIn May last year, Michelle Obama invited rapper, actor and poet Common\nto perform at a poetry reading for kids.\nCommon is known to hip-hop fans as\nthe \u201cking of conscious hip-hop\u201d with\nhis two decade long career focusing on\ntopics including aversion to violence,\npositivity and fatherhood. However,\nthe poetry and reading was doused in\ncontroversy with the usual rightwing\npundits fanning the \ufb02ames by citing\nCommon\u2019s \u2018A Song for Assata\u2019; a track\nsympathetic to activist Assata Shakur,\nwho was convicted of murdering two\nNew Jersey State Troopers. Sarah Palin\nclaimed the White House \u201clacked class\nand decency\u201d, with Fox News alleging\nCommon to be a \u201cvile rapper\u201d despite\ndescribing his music as \u201cvery positive\u201d\nin a special report a few months previ-ous. Common responded to the controversy through Twitter saying that\n\u201capparently Sarah Palin and Fox News\ndoesn\u2019t like me\u201d; however, I wonder if\nit\u2019d be more worrying if Sarah Palin\nand Fox News did like Common.\nObama\u2019s association with hip-hop\ncan be traced back to his election campaign of 2008. Before his nomination\nas the Democratic nominee, he revealed his iPod playlist showcasing his\nwide-ranging musical taste. Among\nthe likes of Bruce Springsteen, Bob\nDylan and Miles Davis was Jay-Z who\nObama even invited to perform at his\nInauguration Ball. In April 2008, Obama referenced Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cDirt O\ufb00 Your\nShoulder\u201d when he famously brushed\nhis shoulder o\ufb00, in response to criticism by then rival Hillary Clinton, to\nwild cheers at Raleigh in North Carolina. Once elected Obama was even\nlabelled the \u201c\ufb01rst hip-hop President\u201d\nand dubbed \u201cB-Rock\u201d by Vibe Magazine, however his 29-song campaign\nplaylist for the upcoming election had\nnot a single hip-hop song. A glaring\ncontrast can be seen between not only\nObama\u2019s outlook towards hip-hop,\nbut perhaps more interesting, is the\nchange in the hip-hop community\u2019s\nresponse to Obama since his election.\nRewind to before the 2008 election,\nand \u201c95 percent of the hip-hop community [was] singing his praises\u201d with\n\ufb01gures such as Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs,\nRussell Simmons and Jay-Z actively\ncampaigning in support of Obama.\nReferences to Obama were widespread\nin hip-hop during this time, with rappers Ludacris, Common, Talib Kweli,\nwill.i.am, Young Jeezy, Lil Wayne,\nJadakiss, Big Boi, Busta Rhymes and\nmany, many more mentioning Barack\nObama in their songs. Common had\nset the trend through namedropping\nObama back in 2004 with the lyrics\n\u201cWhy is Bush acting like he trying to\nget Osama? Why don\u2019t we impeach\nhim and elect Obama?\u201d on the remix\nof the song \u2018Why\u2019 featuring Jadakiss,\nStyles P and Nas. Hip-hop legend Nas\nendorsed Obama extensively through\nhis song \u2018Black President\u2019 which contained samples from Obama\u2019s acceptance speech as well as Tupac\u2019s \u2018I\nWonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto\u2019 for\nthe hook (\u201cAlthough it seems heaven\nsent, we ain\u2019t ready to see a black President\u201d). Nas revokes Tupac\u2019s cynicism\nand scepticism, renovating it into a\nmessage of hope and optimism, much\nin line with Obama\u2019s campaign.\nhe hip-hop celebrity endorsements\nwere obviously worth their while. Political scientist Darrell West of the\nBrookings Institution claims that \u201ccelebrities can help in particular niches...\nyou can match a celebrity and target\nand appeal to those types of communities\u201d. An analysis by Centre for\nInformation and Research on Civic\nLearning and Engagement (CIRCLE)\nshowed the voter turnout for AfricanAmericans aged 18 \u2013 29 in the 2008\nelection was the highest in American\nhistory at 58.2%; up by 8.7% from the\nprevious election. he turnout for this\nparticular voter demographic was\nhigher than any other eligible racial\nor ethnic group in that election, which\nwas a \ufb01rst in the history of American\nvoting.\nHowever, as Obama\u2019s term progressed the tide turned and voices of\ndissent appeared amongst the hiphop crowd. Jay-Z and Obama have\nhad an enduring relationship that has\neven been described as a \u201cbromance\u201d\nwith Jay-Z declaring he has Obama on\nspeed dial. Nevertheless, Jay-Z admits\nthat some of the criticism directed towards Obama is \u201cfair\u201d acknowledging\nthat \u201cnumbers don\u2019t lie\u201d when asked\nabout unemployment during a Watch\nhe hrone promotional interview\nwith GQ. His fellow Inauguration VIP,\nSean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs told he Source\nearlier this year that \u201cI love the President like most of us. I just want the\nPresident to do better\u201d.\nPerhaps the most critical attacks\non Obama came from Chicago based\nrapper Lupe Fiasco. In an interview\nwith CBS in 2008, Lupe Fiasco called\nObama \u201cthe biggest terrorist\u201d in the\nUnited States of America, who went\non to further state that the terrorism\nin foreign states is directly related to\nObama\u2019s foreign policy. Furthermore,\nLupe Fiasco\u2019s single \u201cWords I Never\nSaid\u201d expands upon his criticism by\nreferencing Obama\u2019s silence upon Israel\u2019s 22 day bombardment of Gaza\nthrough the lyrics \u201cGaza strip was getting bombed, Obama didn\u2019t say shit.\nhat\u2019s why I ain\u2019t vote for him, next one\neither\u201d. he disapproval of Obama in\nhip-hop isn\u2019t just limited to American\nartists. London based political activist\nand rapper Lowkey labelled Obama\nas \u201chandsome face of an ugly empire\u201d\nand released two tracks entitled \u201cObamanation\u201d (part 1 & 2), which launch\nscathing condemnation of Obama. In\n\u201cObamanation (part 2)\u201d M-1 (of political hip-hop group dead prez) declared\nObama \u201ca master of disguise, expert at\ntelling lies\u201d.\nWith less hip-hop artists promoting Obama, many hip-hop artists have\nchanged their tune. Veteran rapper\nKRS-One and Mobb Deep member\nProdigy both lent their support to\nTexas Congressman and former Republican presidential candidate Ron\nPaul during the GOP primaries. Rapper Speech, of Arrested Development, who supported Obama in 2008,\nsaid he felt \u201cdisillusioned with some\nthings that Obama has done\u201d and that\nhe would support Ron Paul. Snoop\nDogg had posted a photo of Ron Paul\non his Facebook page with the caption\n\u201csmoke weed everyday\u201d, although he\nrecently posted on Twitter a list of reasons why he was voting for Obama as\nopposed to Romney.\nEarlier this year, cult underground\nhip-hop \ufb01gure El-P joined forces with\nSouthern rapper Killer Mike and released the album R.A.P. Music. he\ncombination of El-P\u2019s trademark sonic\nand aggressive production and Killer\nMike\u2019s introspective and emotive lyrics took critics and hip-hop fans by\nstorm and is a shoe-in for hip-hop release of the year. he track \u201cReagan\u201d\nattracted a wide deal of controversy as\nit vehemently criticised Ronald Reagan and his presidency, in particular\nthe Iran-Contra scandal. Killer Mike\nalso panned Obama calling him \u201cjust\nanother talking head telling lies on teleprompters\u201d. However, in an interview\nwith HipHopDX, Killer Mike stated\nthat he hasn\u2019t jumped o\ufb00 the Obama\nbandwagon and that he\u2019s \u201cstill \ufb01rmly\non the train in the \ufb01rst class\u201d but he\nwon\u2019t be voting in the upcoming elec-tion. He isn\u2019t alone. Compton based\nrapper Kendrick Lamar revealed that\nhe wouldn\u2019t be voting in the upcoming election, with Lupe Fiasco and\nSpaceGhostPurrp taking the same\nstance.\nVoting or not, the election goes\nahead next week. With Obama not including any hip-hop songs on his election campaign play-list, it\u2019s clear that\nhe is having a \u201cSister Souljah moment\u201d\nand taking a moderate role up against\nRomney. he lack of hip-hop endorsements that Obama had had in 2008,\nmay be an indicator of Obama losing\nthe \u201ccool factor\u201d, begging the question\non everyone\u2019s mouth for next Tuesday:\nHasaan Choudry discovers that the President has lost his mojo\nI grew out of\nmy hip-hop\nphase when\nI was 16.\nWay ahead\nof you man\nHappier times\nin 2008\n\n"

It was a quiet night.\nI kept on walking, a silhouette against\nthe bright shop fronts, welcoming the\nshadows of the houses. Passing home-ward-bound, amorous couples after\ntheir nights out, I kept on, steadfast. I\ncouldn\u2019t a\ufb00ord to be late.\nMy contact was to meet me outside\nthe o\ufb03ce, come rain or shine. hat\u2019s\nwhat we\u2019re paying him for. We don\u2019t\ncall him Timmy the Squirrel for noth-ing. Two unremarkable, grey streets\nlater and I was under the cover of the\narch and past the gates. Leaning on\nthe wall, towards the end of the tun-nel, I saw him. He\u2019s well known around\nthese parts as the go-to guy for news.\nYou don\u2019t mess with him, or you\u2019ll \ufb01nd\nyour face plastered around town. As\nI got closer, the light from the courtyard highlighted his trademark stripy\njumper and the cigarette hanging\nfrom the corner of his mouth. Only it\nwasn\u2019t a cigarette. It was a maoam.\n\u201cHere\u2019s your latest shipment\u201d, that\nfamiliar voice squeaked, as he handed\nme a box. \u201cPayment\u2019ll be as usual\u201d\nI replied, stu\ufb03ng the box into my\ncoat pocket, away from prying eyes. I\ndidn\u2019t want to be caught carrying such\na risky package. Not since my predecessor Ricky the Flounder was found\n\ufb02oating in the hames. He couldn\u2019t\nlive up to his name.\nI bid the Squirrel farewell. What I\ndidn\u2019t tell him is that I\u2019d be rocking all\nnight long with that little box of his\nand I couldn\u2019t wait to get back to my\ndesk to try out the goods. He doesn\u2019t\nneed to hear about my night-life. He\nhas enough snitches to do that for\nhim.\nI turned back into the rain, retracing my steps. he streets were cold,\nbut the night was warm as I hurried\nmy way back to the apartment, staying\naway from sight.\nMy apartment door was still locked\nand the seals hadn\u2019t been broken. I was\nsafe. I sat down at my desk, turned on\nmy computer and poured out a glass\nof cheap whisky. Once my computer\nhad booted, I pulled the package out\nfrom my jacket. It took me years to\n\ufb01nd it. Stone Quarry Simulator. he\ngenuine article.\nAfter a quick installation, my night\u2019s\npleasure was ready. No need for those\nMarilyn Monroe impersonators to-night.\nI started with the basics, jumping\ninto a large truck with a couple of saw-blades stuck on the front. I\u2019ve never\ndriven one of these machines before,\nbut it should be easy. Straight into the\nwater. Darn it. Next try. I rammed\ninto the wall, like a sailor away on\nshore-leave, into a call-girl, drilling\naway. Rocks \ufb02ew everywhere and the\nground shook beneath me.\nMy next task was to pack the van\nwith dynamite. Needless to say, after\nthe unfortunate ice-cream van explosion that took out the Mysterious\nBrown, I\u2019m well-versed in packing\nvehicles full of explosives. I drove to\nthe target and drilled into the rock.\nhere was no instruction manual for\nthe pneumatic drill, so that was an\ninteresting and unproductive initial 5\nminutes. With the explosives packed\ninto the holes and covered up like a\nshallow grave, I drove the van over the\nexplosives. Detonator in hand, I saw a\nwarning about my vehicle being too\nclose to the dynamite. It was too late\nto stop the explosion.\nIt seems they make these vans out\nof metal stronger than that in icecream vans, as my get-away vehicle\nwas untouched. And \ufb02oating above\nthe ground.\nGrowing tired of being told what\nto do, I decided to start my career in\nrock pushing. My \ufb01rst task was to buy\na quarry. With 100,000 bucks spent on\na piece of land, I started my life, poorer than the bums you see on the street.\nMy secretary handed me a note - collect 120kg of armorstone for an anonymous buyer. Ten minutes of drilling\nand transporting later, the shipment\nwas complete. My pay was wired over\nto me. 2000$. Sixty more jobs like\nthat and I can buy a new quarry. No\nthanks. I\u2019m not a shmuck. his line of\nwork aint for me.

Laptops, consoles and \u201cYou\nn00b!\u201d screaming across the room,\nmarking the start of the training session for this week\u2019s UCL vs Imperial\ngaming tournaments. his was just\nthe beginning.\nIn the dark depths of the Sher\ufb01eld\nbuilding (beneath Holland Club, to be\nprecise) the Gaming Club committee\nwas scheming. hey were setting up\nfor a night that would even give veteran My Little Pony players, night-mares. his was going to be a Halloween like no other.\nIn the function room, the consoles\nwere set up and the computers de-ployed. On o\ufb00er: a variety of games\nmade to have you scream like a little\ngirl. When the clock struck 6pm, the\ndoors creaked open, unleashing the\nhorde into the basement of the condemned Holland Club.\nhe night started slowly - bringing\nin casual games of zombie slaughter\nto the masses. Nazi zombies grabbed\nout at you, as you emptied your last\nclip and the dogs dashed for your\nthroat, as you ran away.\nAdjacent, the screen \ufb02ashed blue as\nenergy swords dropped the survivors\nto the ground, shields and armour de-pleted.\nhe night wasn\u2019t always that peaceful\nhowever. In a dark, dark corner of the\nroom, the atmosphere became much\nmore bleak. Isolated from the rest of the\nroom,ourvictimstooktheirturns,one-by-one to face the Slender man. Alone.\nRunning through the woods, \ufb02ashlight\nbobbing, trying to \ufb01nd the notes of the\nlast survivors. Just don\u2019t look at his face\nand you\u2019ll be \ufb01ne.\nOnce all sanity (and the spare un-derwear) had been depleted, we moved\ninto the abandoned European castle\nof Amnesia. Followed by shadows and\nchased by the darkness, you make your\nway through the libraries and cellars of\nthe god-forsaken fortress. Only when\nyou reach the \ufb02ooded tunnels and you\nsee the water ripple, as some invisible\nstalker makes his way towards you, do\nyou realise that all hope is lost.\nFor those who hadn\u2019t wimped out and\nrun o\ufb00 to the comfort of pizza and the\nHolland Club bar, one challenge still re-mained. SCP Containment Breach. We\ncovered SCPCB last year, but for those\nwhomissedit,it\u2019sbasedo\ufb00theSCPuniverse (duh!). It all started with a massive\nwiki page, containing hundreds of listed items - any of which could ruin your\nday. hink of the premise of Warehouse\n13, but where everything is Lovecraftian e.g. a neverending staircase and\nfor SCPCB, monsters where you can\u2019t\nblink, or you\u2019ll die (don\u2019t even bother\npointing out the similarities to Doctor\nWho). Crying and screaming over, it\nwas time to go home.\nIt\u2019s a shame that the future of the Holland Club is uncertain - it\u2019s a great activity space for club events. Let\u2019s hope\nwe don\u2019t lose our way.\nRoss Webster\nThe headless,\nhorseless man\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER 29\nGames Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYo dawg, I heard you like trucks?\nTruck-ception?\nAny help would be welcome.\nNo quarrier has the right to\nlook that happy, unless he\u2019s\ndrilling something special.\n\n"

Sure \u2013 we knew it\nwas Daniel Craig, and we knew what\nthe baddie looked like, and the ever-present Bond girls, and the new geeky\nQ\u2026. but that tells us nothing really.\nAnd after the slight disappointment\nof Quantum of Solace (probably not\nhelped by the brilliance of Casino\nRoyale, nor by the competition of Nolan\u2019s excellent he Dark Night), Skyfall\nneeded to be something spectacular.\nWell, it\u2019s safe to say that this one\ncertainly hit the target.\nDirectorMendes(AmericanBeauty,\nStarter for Ten) takes us on an almost\nclassically familiar journey with some\nexcellently spun twists. We join Bond\nin one of the best opening chases ever\n\u2013 racing motorbikes over rooftops\nin Istanbul in a desperate and hair-raising attempt to retrieve a stolen\ncomputer disk that holds the secret\nidentities of NATO agents working\nundercover in terrorist organisations.\nDespite Bond\u2019s best e\ufb00orts, the disk is\nlost \u2013 and, heart-stoppingly, for a moment so is 007 himself. But, of course,\nit\u2019s all a ruse and our eponymous\nhero returns after Adele\u2019s cracking\nopening sequence \u2013 older, unkempt\nand distinctly o\ufb00 his game. In the\nwise eyes of M (Dench), however, he\nis still the best man for the case, and\nis retrained and retested under the\nwatchful eye of the new Chairman of\nthe Intelligence and Security Committee, Gareth Mallory (Fiennes). To\nsolve this latest case, Bond is sent o\ufb00\nto some of the most exotic parts of the\nworld: Macau, Glencoe and Shanghai\nto name a few\u2026\nSix years on from Casino Royale,\nyou might be forgiven for expecting Craig to have waned somewhat.\nhis is so far from the truth; Craig\ngives a truly stirring, funny, action-packed performance\u2026 even if he does\nrun a bit like an ostrich. Surely this\ncon\ufb01rms that Craig is the best Bond\never to grace our screens. Whereas,\nin Royale, Bond was a cocky, trigger-happy Oxford graduate, in Skyfall\nour man has matured but not lost his\ntouch. he one-liners make a tentative but very welcome return, and\nBond\u2019s rapport with his colleagues is\nsharper and wittier than ever. Scriptwriters Purvis, Wade and Logan constantly remind us that Bond\u2019s physical prowess is diminishing, but his\nverbal sparring with both M and new\nbad guy Raoul Silva (Bardem) is quick\nand as nimble as it has ever been.\nSilva himself \u2013 a disa\ufb00ected ex-agent with several emotional issues \u2013 is horri\ufb01cally creepy. Bardem\nportrays this latest madman with a\nwonderfully unnerving camp turn,\nmaking Silva one of the strangest villains since the Roger Moore \ufb01lms.\nHis \ufb01lthy, blond, nicotine-stained\nhair (which awkwardly brings Julian\nAssange to mind) only enhances his\nperformance as it hangs nauseatingly around his face. Along with his\n\u2018courtesy\u2019 and his constant \ufb02irting,\nBardem creates a tension-\ufb01lling character whose next move just cannot be\npredicted.\nBacking up the main pair is an absolutely stellar supporting cast. Dench\nis back for yet another outstanding\nperformance as M \u2013 in trouble over\nher decisions yet, as always, \ufb01ercely\ndefending them. With a lot of new\nfaces, Dench\u2019s arrival is almost reas-suring, and she makes much more\nof an appearance in this \ufb01lm than\nin any of the others, and with much\nmore emotion. Fiennes\u2019 appearance,\nthough new, is also hugely welcome.\nMallory is stu\ufb00y, uptight, and argumentative \u2013 but you can\u2019t help liking\nhim. Which is good\u2026 but no more\nsaid here.\nhe new gadget-man Q is unveiled,\nand is the epitome of \u2018geek chic\u2019. With\nhis \ufb02oppy, tousled hair, stylish specs\nand Scrabble mug, it\u2019s probably safe\nto say that, while the gentlemen in the\ncinema were focusing on the latest\npalmprint-identifying handgun, the\nladies\u2026 weren\u2019t. Nerdy good looks\naside, however, Q (Ben Wishaw) is\nanother man with a fast line in patter,\nand strikes up an instant, and recip-rocated, loyalty to Bond. He is de\ufb01nitely a favourite new character, and\none that many will be looking forward to seeing again. Only two Bond\ngirls worth mentioning \u2013 pretty \ufb01eld\nagent Eve (Naomie Harris), who has\na warm and sexy vibe about her and\nis something more than Bond\u2019s colleague (but what is her surname\u2026?),\nand the beautiful but expendable\nS\u00e9v\u00e9rine (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe).\nMendes and the writers let the quieter moments pause, but they have\nalso proved rather good at the \u2018loud\nbangs\u2019 side of things too. Nine-time\nOscar-nominated cinematographer\nRoger Deakins makes the ambitious\naction sequences \u2013 which had the\npotential of being utterly ridiculous\n\u2013 the most beautiful in all the \ufb01lms.\nhe wonderfully tense opening scene\nin Istanbul is soon beaten by the \ufb01ght\nin Shanghai, where Bond chases an\nassassin through a glass skyscraper\nwhich constantly \ufb02icks between pitch\nblack and bright light thanks to the\nrolling neon adverts outside. And\nfrankly none of the \ufb01ghts even come\nclose to that in the Komodo dragon\nenclosure.\nFifty years down the line and the\nworld is still utterly hooked on Bond.\nTimes have changed, terrorists have\nadvanced and nobody believes that\nBond needs to go to the moon anymore \u2013 and the new \ufb01lms prove,\nbeautifully, that the 007 franchise is\nmoving spectacularly forward. \u201cWe\ndon\u2019t go in for exploding pens any\nmore,\u201d quips the new Q \u2013 and nor do\naudiences.\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nBond 23: The Skyfall of M\nDirector: Sam Mendes\nScreenwriters: Neal Purvis, Robert\nWade, John Logan\nStarring: Daniel Craig, Judi Dench,\nJavier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes\nWe not only get one sexy Bond but TWO sexy Bonds!\nsome good chums and I came across\na cinema showing Fritz the Cat. I coincidentally had only read about it a\ncouple of days earlier so I suggested\nto the cohort that we catch the closing 15 minutes. As we loitered around\nthe back, someone else walked in\nand asked what the \ufb01lm was about. It\nseemed appropriate for me to answer\nthe question with the following:\n\u201cIt\u2019s an animated \ufb01lm in which a\nhedonistic cat is used as a metaphor\nto explore various social issues that\nwere particularly relevant in late 60s\nand early 70s urban America\u201d\nWhat I \ufb01red o\ufb00 sums up the \ufb01lm\nfairly well, but I had made two big\nmistakes. Firstly I had gone in too\nhigh brow and soon found myself in\na conversation I wasn\u2019t particularly\nkeen on having. Secondly, I had not\nmentioned that the \ufb01lm is also about\nenlightenment. Admittedly, that is an\naspect that wasn\u2019t very obvious in the\nlast 15 minutes, but when my friends\nand I watched the \ufb01lm in its entirety\nwe realised that the whole plot consistently revolves around it.\nhe storyline of the \ufb01lm is largely\nbased on the travels of Fritz whilst he\nis on the run as a fugitive. hrough-out his adventures, Fritz often tries to\n\ufb01nd answers to the more challenging\nquestions in life; however, as hinted\nearlier, a lot of the \ufb01lm is concerned\nwith subjects that were acutely topical such as protest and civil rights.\nhere are moments that are very\naesthetically imaginative, such as\npool balls being pocketed to represent\na dying man\u2019s \ufb01nal heart beats and\nscenes easily escalate in absurdness\nat a quick rate; \ufb01ghter jets bombing.\nbeing an initially small street disturbance is just one example that comes\nto mind.\nSo, if you\u2019re at a loose end I personally would recommend watching a\n\ufb01lm about a tabby cat that goes about\nachieving illumination by indulging\nin an excess of sex, drugs and rock &\nroll.\nChristian Franke Writer\nFritz the Cat\nDirector: Ralph Bakshi\nScreenwriters: Ralph Bakshi, Robert\nCrumb\nAnd real men pluck their own chest hair...\n\n"

Chilly Gonzales has\nreleased pop albums and rap albums,\nhe set a world record for the longest\ncontinual playing of the piano, had\nhis music used by Steve Jobs to sell\ntrillions of \ufb02ashing pieces of glass and\nmetal, and even made an \u201cexistential\nsports comedy\u201d \ufb01lm focussing on\nthe little-known sport of jazz-chess\n( ...and breathe). However his most\nsuccessful release has been the Solo\nPiano album he gifted the world in\n2004. In this work he put the bravado\naside to record half an hour of beautifully delicate piano melodies, showing us that behind all the madcap rap\nlyrics and ridiculous attire lies some\nserious talent.\nIt was with his second, recently\nreleased solo piano compositions\nthat he began the Barbican show.\nWith Gonzales illuminated by a single spotlight and positioned centre\nstage the crowd hung on every creak\nof the Steinway\u2019s hammers. Solo Piano II carries on where the \ufb01rst left\no\ufb00; melancholic and touching, Gonzales\u2019 love for the minor keys is on\nfull display. Indeed it was this preference over the \u201cpolitically conservative\u201d major keys that he proceeded to\ndemonstrate by shifting classics such\nas \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019, \u2018Frere Jacques\u2019\nand \u2018Chariots of Fire\u2019 into the minor\nrealm, whilst making jokes about\nWorld War II and his jewish heritage\namongst other things. You wouldn\u2019t\nget that on \u201cLater... With Jools Holland\u201d.\nhe entertainer extraordinaire then\ncomposed a piece, live, with the aid\nof a child plucked from the audience\nbefore debuting his rather ambitious\nproject of composing a piano con-certo. I\u2019m not used to appreciating\nextended pieces of classical music,\nmy initial wonder tends to wane after\na few minutes and my mind drifts o\ufb00.\nUnfortunately Gonzales was unable\nto prevent this fate with his e\ufb00ort.\nhings picked up again, however,\nas Chilly used the orchestra to full effect in creating a barn-storming version of his electro-rap epic \u2018Take Me\nTo Broadway\u2019. he show climaxed as\nGonzales instructed, through conductor Jules Buckley, the creation\nof pop music\u2019s equivalent of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster. he bass line of\n\u2018Another One Bites the Dust\u2019, a pitch-shifted variant of the \u2018Billie Jean\u2019 ri\ufb00\nand the strings from Britney Spears\u2019\n\u2018Toxic\u2019 were all combined and rapped\nover. And it pretty much worked. Not\ncontent with that however, Gonzales\ndescended into the crowd and tried\nhis very best at \u2018sur\ufb01ng\u2019 the Barbican;\nalmost certainly the \ufb01rst time crowd\nsur\ufb01ng has been witnessed at a venue more used to playing host to the\nhigh-brow end of live music.\nAfter much applause for the BBC\nSymphony Orchestra and a standing\nSimon Hunter Music Editor\nThe best use of a\nsatin dressing gown\nsince Hugh Hefner\nCave Painting: Votive Life\nCave Painting are a Brighton based\nband signed to hird Rock Recordings. heir debut album Votive Life\nreleased on 24th September this year\ncertainly promised much, but did it\nreally deliver? here was a lot of hype\nsurrounding the album prior to its release because of the popularity of their\npre-released tracks, such as \u2018Rio\u2019 and\n\u2018Gator\u2019. Not to mention the fact that\nthey have played a few dates with Mercury Prize nominees (and favourites\nto win) Alt-J, who actually have one\nof the best albums I\u2019ve heard this year\nso far. It really does feel like Votive Life\nwill meet the hype at \ufb01rst\u2026but then it\nstarts to get less convincing.\nhe album opens with \u2018Leaf\u2019 which\nbegins with an assault of noise then\ncuts into the softness of singer Adam\nKane\u2019s voice. It\u2019s a solid song and a\ngreat opener to the album. Nu\ufb00 said.\nNext is \u2018Gator\u2019 which is without doubt\none of the stand-out tracks of the al-bum. Kane\u2019s lilting vocals and the African glockenspiel sums up their distinctive sound \u2013 swaying, atmospheric\nindie rock. If that makes any sense at\nall. his is the track to listen to if you\nwant to know what they\u2019re about. \u2018So\nCalm\u2019, my personal favourite, includes\nKane\u2019s soaring vocals and chiming\nchords courtesy of guitarist Harry\nSmallwood. he repeating line \u201cI\u2019m\nnot wasting time\u201d sticks in your head\nfor hours, especially if you\u2019ve been\nprocrastinating when you\u2019ve got a load\nof work to do. Jonathan McCawley\u2019s\ndrums in \u2018Handle\u2019 match the tribal\nnamesake of the band to produce a\nslightly darker sound than the previous songs. To me, this song in particular acted as a bit of a metaphor for the\nwhole album really: it starts o\ufb00 really\nwell, lulls, gets good for a bit, and then\ndrops again.\nIt\u2019s when we reach \u2018Only Us\u2019 that the\nappeal of Kane\u2019s drawn vocals starts\nto wear o\ufb00 and it gets a bit exasper-ating. As a standalone track, it could\nwork but here I feel it blends into the\nbackground of the album. Also, at 3:23\nthe music cuts o\ufb00 and his voice has a\nbit of a David Gray tone to it (remem-ber him? yeah, I cringed too) and the\nfact that this is the best bit of the song\nsays it all really. \u2018he Gator\u2019 interlude\nis a nice break in the album and a reminder of how well it all started, and\nthen we move onto the (sorry, it\u2019s got\nto be said) distinctly average \u2018Pair Up\u2019\nwhich feels more like an album-\ufb01ller\nthan a genuine track. hey could do\nwithout it to be honest. Similarly, I\nfound \u2018Simoleon\u2019 forgettable and the\nguitar reprise at the end sounds nowhere near as epic as it should have\ndone.\nBut then we\u2019re gifted with \u2018Rio\u2019 and\nit feels like there\u2019s hope yet! his is\nwhere his vocals really work, with the\nbest bit being the line \u201cWho would\nhave seen my face, when I was a hollow man?\u201d. Deep stu\ufb00. he sheer vulnerability in his voice when he sings\n\u201cRiooooo\u201d and \u201cI won\u2019t go\u201d and the a\ncapella \u201cSo loooong\u201d at the end makes\nyou fall in love with them again. But\nthat feeling\u2019s short-lived, as the \u2018Me\nYou Soon\u2019 interlude is a major anticlimax that doesn\u2019t \ufb01t as well as the\nother interlude in the album, followed\nby \u2018Nickel\u2019. Just\u2026disappointment. To\nclose the album we have \u2018Forming\u2019\u2013\nan average song to end an average album which, I hasten to add, is a real\npity seeing as Cave Painting is a band\nwith so much potential.\nhere are some incredible tracks on\nthis album (Leaf, Gator, So Calm, Rio)\nbut you might as well not listen to the\nrest of it because although it starts o\ufb00\npromising, by the end it has ultimately\nfailed to deliver. Many of the other\ntracks do just feel more like album\ufb01llers than anything else. It could\nJeni Pillai Writer\nDoes this much anticipated release live up to the hype and early promise?\nhave been terrible had it not been for\nthose aforementioned gems. Singer\nKane\u2019s vocals are the focus of the\nband\u2019s sound and they de\ufb01nitely have\na lilting vulnerable charm, but it does\nstart to wear thin midway through the\nalbum. Nevertheless, I still look forward to what Cave Painting will do in\nthe future. Any band that\u2019s so actively\ninvolved in their own art and design,\nand can write a song about a girl called\nRio without mentioning trivial things\nlike how she dances in the sand, have\ngot my respect.\nLook at how\npretty this cover\nis. It is 3D!!!\n\u201c\n\u201d\nd b i\nd b\novation for the man himself, Gonzales returned to the stage to bewilder\nthe audience one last time by reciting\na medley of \u2018Gogol\u2019 and \u2018Overnight\u2019.\nSat on the \ufb02oor. With his head underneath the piano.\nhis was a performance in which\none of the greatest imaginations and\nentertainers in music was given the\ntools he\u2019d previously only dreamt of.\nhe result was beautiful, hilarious,\nstupefying and brash.

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n31\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n13 December 2012. his is a date that\nshould be imprinted into everyone\u2019s\nmind \u2013 from those who know that by\ndivine law, Ol\u00f3rin is not allowed to\nuse his magic directly against orcs to\nthose who only know him as Gandalf.\nFor it is on this day that he Hobbit:\nAn Unexpected Journey will \ufb01nally be\nreleased in the UK.\nhough many may take this date\nfor granted, it was not always certain\nthat he Hobbit would ever become a\nreality. Let us look back and remind\nourselves how lucky we are to be able\nto see a hobbit that is directed by Peter Jackson.\nPeter Jackson wanted to make he\nHobbit as far back as 1995. But the\ndistribution rights belonged to one\nstudio, the production rights to an-other, and no-one seemed ready to\nsell anything. So New Line Cinema\n(who owned the rights to Lord of the\nRings) told Jackson to go ahead and\nmake the Lord of the Rings trilogy\n\ufb01rst.\nWhen he Return of the King was\nreleased in 2003, the issue of he\nHobbit resurfaced. New Line Cinema\nhowever, at the time, had their hands\nfull with a number of lawsuits; Peter\nJackson, he Tolkien Trust, and Saul\nZaentz (producer of the 1978 Lord of\nthe Rings cartoon) were all suing New\nLine Cinema for \u2018withholding pro\ufb01ts\u2019.\nFortunately, by 2007, most of these\nwere settled, and remarkably New\nLine Cinema soon after decided to\npartner up with MGM (who together\nowned all the necessary rights on he\nHobbit) to co-produce and co-\ufb01nance\nthe \ufb01lm.\nhis immediately brought up the\nquestion: who should direct the \ufb01lm?\nEver since Peter Jackson\u2019s trilogy\nappeared in the cinemas it was pretty\nobvious to the public that he was the\nbest man to also make he Hobbit.\nhe studios, however, did not share\nhis view, they chose Guillermo del\nToro. A terrible choice. he man was\npreviously quoted saying \u201cI don\u2019t like\nlittle guys and dragons, hairy feet,\nhobbits\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t like sword and\nsorcery, I hate all that stu\ufb00\u201d.\nPre-production began in 2008 and\nfor the next two years, as expected,\nDel Toro managed to continuously\n\ufb01ndspectacularwaystoruinheHobbit. Amongst these were redesigning\nwargs because he found they looked\ntoo much like hyenas and making\nanimals speak so people would not be\nless weirded out by a speaking dragon\nat the end. He even spent a lot of time\nwatching WWI documentaries because he thought that many elements\nin he Hobbit represented aspects of\nWWI, despite Tolkien explicitly stating this is not true.\nhankfully Del Toro got \u2018fed up\nby too many delays\u2019 and left in early\n2010. Again, the studios got into a\nhuge discussion about who should\nbe the director, considering almost\neveryone from David Yates (Harry\nPotter) to David Dobkin (Wedding\nCrashers).\nHowever, due to overwhelming fan\npressure, and a sudden surprising\nwave of common sense, the studios\neventually settled for Jackson. Jackson was \ufb01nally on board as director.\nBut the drama had not yet ended.\nIn late 2010, after building of the\nsets had already begun, the actors\nunions suddenly begun protests and\nordered their actors to stop working.\nStrikes were so extensive that Warner\nBros (who by then had merged with\nNew Line Cinema) threatened to\nmove production elsewhere (the Harry Potter studies in the UK were mentioned at some point). But eventually\nthat cleared up as well and production remained in New Zealand.\nVery soon after the failed union\nprotests, in October 2010, the budget was announced at $500million,\nhigher than any movie that has gone\nbefore it and almost twice the budget\nof the currently most expensive \ufb01lm\n(Pirates of the Caribbean: At World\u2019s\nEnd).\nIn November 2010 Peter Jackson famously ordered 30 red EPIC cameras\n(each costing some $58,000). hese\nrecord in what is called 5k, a resolution that most cinemas don\u2019t even\nhave the equipment to display at.\nIn April 2011, in another controversial move, Peter Jackson revealed that\nthe movie will be \ufb01lmed in 48 frames\nper second (fps), deviating from the\nstandard 24fps \u2013 which has been\nused for almost every movie since the\n1920s. his should reduce \u2018strobing\u2019\nand immerse the audience even more.\nBut critics who saw it at the April\n2012 cinemacon were sceptic and said\nit looked almost \u2018too real\u2019.\nBut perhaps the most controversial\nchoice of all was just recently, in July\n2012, when it was announced that he\nHobbit would be made into 3 \ufb01lms\nand turned into a trilogy because apparently \u2018there was too much material\nto cover in one \ufb01lm\u2019. his meant that\nhe Hobbit, which consists of only\nabout 300 pages in its original hard-cover, would be made into the same\nnumber of movies as the 1600 page\nLord of the Rings. Whether this is just\na typical money-milking stunt, or\nwhether there really is three movies\u2019\nworth of material, only time will tell.\nAll in all, we can be very glad that\nPeter Jackson did end up directing\nand he even managed to get most of\nthe old team back. I\u2019m really excited\nto see what Peter Jackson and his\nteam have come up with and can\u2019t\nwait to see the \ufb01rst instalment of he\nHobbit.\nBut before we watch the prequel,\nand as we anticipate its release, what\nbetter time is there to rewatch the\nLord of the Rings? \u2013 To refresh our\nmemory of Legolas and Gimli before\nwe meet their fathers (yes, that\u2019s right,\nhranduil and Gloin are appearing in\nhe Hobbit).\nNow, back on home ground, in\na clever move by the ICU Cinema,\nthey will be showing the Lord of the\nRings marathon on the 2nd \ufb02oor of\nthe Union, on the 4th of November,\njust a few weeks before the release of\nhe Hobbit. he marathon should last\nfrom 1pm to 11pm. his is a lengthy\n\ufb01lm session for sure, and lasting all\nten hours is known amongst the cinema sta\ufb00 as a feat of manliness only\nsurpassed by staying awake for the\nentirety of their December all-night-er.\nBut Frodo\u2019s journey from he Shire\nto Mount Doom took over 6 months\nin real time. And so anything under\nten hours wouldn\u2019t really do the journey justice.\nhis will probably be the last chance\nto see the trilogy on a 33 foot screen\nin professional 35mm quality before\nhe Hobbit is released. And for a \ufb01ver\nonline or six at the door all I can say is\nI\u2019ll see you there!\nSize doesn\u2019t matter\nPaavo Schafer Writer\nBased on true events, Affleck\u2019s latest\ndirectorial is a darkly comic mixture\nof thriller and political satire.\nWhen the US embassy in Tehran\nis stormed in November 1979 in retaliation for American interference in\nIranian politics, six diplomats, nicknamed \u2018the house-guests\u2019 take shelter\nin the Canadian ambassador\u2019s (Victor\nGarber) private residence. With the\nrest of the embassy sta\ufb00 held hostage,\nand their captors looking for the es-capees, the US State Department faces the task of safely extracting them\nfrom the country.\nCIA operative Tony Mendez (Af\ufb02eck) is brought in to consult, and devises a plan so ridiculous it becomes\nthe only viable option: indeed it is the\n\u201cbest bad idea\u201d that they could dream\nup. he trapped embassy workers\nneeded a valid reason to be in the\ncountry, in order for them to avoid\narousing suspicion when trying to\nleave. Inspired by his son\u2019s love for\nsci-\ufb01, Mendez and Hollywood makeup artist (Goodman) enlist the help\nof \ufb01lm producer Lester Siegel (Arkin),\nserial scene stealer who delivers some\nof the \ufb01lm\u2019s best lines with expert\ntiming; and together set up a fake\n\ufb01lm studio and begin to create hype\naround a pretend \ufb01lm, Argo. Set on a\nplanet with a Middle Eastern atmos-phere, it is a hilariously cheesy \ufb01lm: a\ncase-study into all that\u2019s wrong with\nHollywood.\nhe embassy workers are assigned\nnew Canadian identities: they are\nproduction sta\ufb00 members location\nscouting for the \ufb01lm. Mendez \ufb02ies\nto Iran to meet the group, and then\ntogether, the seven have to convince\nthe Iranians that the \ufb01lm is real, and\nthat their identities are genuine. he\ngroup faces a race against time to get\nout of the country before they are dis-covered.\nhis is a little known piece of history that seems made for \ufb01lm: the\njuxtaposition of the satirical farce of\nHollywood is all the funnier against\nthe serious and rather gritty situation unfolding across the other side\nof the world. Which is just as well \u2013\ntoo serious and the \ufb01lm would be too\nheavy and oppressive, yet something\ntoo comic would be inappropriate,\ngiven lives were always at stake. he\n\ufb02ipping between locations keeps the\nscreenplay dynamic and pacing ur-gent. Amusing similarities are drawn\nbetween selling the \ufb01lm\u2019s legitimacy\nto the Iranians, and feeding the \ufb01lm\nto the American media: it\u2019s all for\nshow, all just a goal directed business\n(as Mendez points out, \ufb01lmmakers\nwould shoot \u201cin Stalingrad, with Pol\nPot directing\u201d if they thought it would\nmake money): contrast against Af\ufb02eck\u2019s \ufb01lm, which is beautifully constructed and full of heart.\nAttention to detail is clearly important to Affleck, as the actors chosen\nto play the embassy workers were\nsurprising like their real-life coun-terparts, as shown from real life stills\nof the group, well played by the little\nknown actors Tate Donovan, Scoot\nMcNairy, Rory Cochrane, Clea DuVall, Kerry Bish\u00e9 and Christopher\nDenham. he weeks the group spend\nin captivity are oppressively claustrophobic and fraught with tension and\nfear; visually conveyed with cramped\nsets, tight close-ups and hazy light-ing. he actors themselves no stranger to isolation: Affleck had the group\nheld in captivity for a week prior to\n\ufb01lming, to add to the authenticity of\nthe piece.\nAffleck plays the pivotal role very\nsubtly \u2013 he is restrained and at times\nalmost bland and too underdevel-oped. But that\u2019s okay: this isn\u2019t a \ufb01lm\nabout characters, it\u2019s a \ufb01lm about a\nplot too good to be true (and probably is), and by stepping back Affleck\ngives the \ufb01lm room to shine. But his\ndirection is \ufb01rst rate \u2013 he executes\nthe complex story perfectly; driving it\nforward; maintaining the sense of ur-gency, weaving together satire, classic\nescape \ufb01lm, historical and political\ncommentary with absolute precision\nand balance. he period feels authen-tic, with grainy cinematography, terrible fashion and the perpetual fog of\ncigarette smoke. he \ufb01nal sequences\nare (literally) nail-bitingly, edge-of-your-seat tense; a testament to an\nentirely absorbing \ufb01lm that keeps its\naudience gripped and emotionally involved right until its conclusion. Argo\nis about intelligence winning out over\nviolence; about the importance of\ngood relations with political allies,\nand has modern day signi\ufb01cance for\nthe American-Iranian relationship.\n\u201cArgo F*** Yourself\u201d\nKaty Bettany Film Editor\nDirector: Ben Affleck\nScreenwriters: Chris Terrio, Joshuah\nBearman\nStarring: Ben Affleck, Bryan\nCranston, Alan Arkin, John Goodman\nWe like to drink with freshers, cos freshers are our mates\n\n"

    "content": "TECHNOLOGY Technology Editor: Jason Parmar\ntechology.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nomewhere in a dank base-ment, a high school white\nAmerican teenager smiles\nto himself for discovering a cute picture of a cat,\nworthy of sharing with his peers. He\n\ufb01res up his browser and heads to a\nwebsite called reddit (www.reddit.\ncom) where he posts a link to his uploaded image in a corner of the website called \u201cAwww\u201d.\nhis is the stereotypical image of a\nreddit user that most of the internet\nand media would like you to have: a\nyoung, white American adult living\nin the basement of his parents. But\nreddit users, or redditors, would like\nto dispute that claim, and perhaps\nrightfully so. Whilst the average user\non reddit might \ufb01t the stereotype\n(according to some study), reddit is\nmuch more than just a website to\npost cute pictures or to plot the next\nnefarious internet mischief (like the\n\u201cAnonymous\u201d attacks on the internet\nlast year), it is, as redditors argue,\none of the bastions of free speech on\nthe internet.\nTo put it simply, reddit is a website\nwhere users can post links or textual\ncontent to anything (well, almost\nanything that isn\u2019t banned by the\nrules). he community decides what\ncontent is worthy, or not, by using a\nvoting system. Any content that is\nhighly voted, and thus highly regarded by the community will surface\nto the front page of the website and\ngain much prominence and tra\ufb03c.\nFree speech is especially valued in\nthe community. he community relies on the voting system to weed out\nthe junk from the good, in theory at\nleast. he community is divided into\ndi\ufb00erent interests groups known as\nsubreddits. Redditors have an eclectic range of interests: from the geeky\nAndroid to the, arguably, mundane\npolitics and even the eye-raising\npooping advice. he website has\nseen massive adoption by leading\n\ufb01gures and celebrities. Most promi-nently, President Obama did a Q&A\nsession on the website. But behind\nall this glamour, lies the dark side\nof the limits of free speech of which\nreddit is \ufb01nding itself embroiled in\nyet another controversy.\nA redditor who goes by the pseudonym ViolentAcrez (pronounced\nviolent acres) has been infamous\nover the last few years on reddit,\neven garnering an \u201caward\u201d for being the worst redditor. ViolentAcrez\nwas infamous for creating several\no\ufb00ensive subreddits, with the most\n\u201cfamous\u201d of them all being \u201cjailbait\u201d.\nJailbait was an avenue for, supposedly horny males, to post snapshots\nof teenage girls who were, most of\nthe time, scantily clad for the scrutiny and enjoyment of the other us-ers. his caused a controversy when\nnetworks like CNN \u201cdiscovered\u201d the\nsubreddit and hoisted it into the\nlimelight of national news. When it\nwas discovered that child pornography has been posted and traded via\nthe subreddit, reddit was forced to\nban the subreddit and institute a rule\non prohibiting child pornography on\nits website, albeit reluctantly. From\nthe perspective of the site\u2019s owners,\nthis was a curtail on free speech that\nthey were reluctant to engage in. he\nsecond major curtail on free speech\nwas to happen right after media site\nGawker posted an expos\u00e9 of ViolenFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\n16\nS\ntAcrez, who turned out to be one\nMichael Brutsch.\nAnonymity is the other core ideology of reddit and this was threatened\nby the expos\u00e9 posted by Gawker. Immediately, a storm brewed on the\nwebsite. Moderators of various popular subreddits scrambled to ban any\nlinks to the article, and even the entire Gawker network of sites. Some\nof them cite the rule of no doxxing\n(the slang term for the revealing of\npersonal information) as the reason\nwhilst others are doing this simply\n\u201cin solidarity\u201d. he website administrators even instituted a temporary\nsite-wide ban on the article. he\ncommunity is split on the issue.\nUsers are split on a couple of is-sues: the rightfulness of the expos\u00e9\nand whether there should be any\ncensorship of links to the expos\u00e9.\nProponents of the expos\u00e9 argue that\nnaming names is one of the few ways\nto stop the stream of o\ufb00ensive con-tent. Many redditors are not exactly\nfond of the questionable content in\nthe \ufb01rst place. Opponents of the expos\u00e9 argue that this is a violation of\nreddit\u2019s rules, and most importantly,\nthe threat of having their identity\nexposed will cause users to withhold\nspeech and practise self-censorship,\nthreatening the very essence of free\nspeech on reddit. Users could even\nbe in danger for merely posting. his\nties in directly with the second is-sue. Proponents argue that the article was a legit and quality article as\na product of investigative journalism\n(which this author must admit: the\narticle was very well written). Opponents argue that the article was\nmerely an attempt at doxxing one\nof the users. here were allegations\nthat the author of the article has\nblackmailed ViolentAcrez, which\nturned out to be untrue. Dissidents\nof the moderation policy have been\nbanned (and then restored). Even\nmoderators weren\u2019t spared.\nReddit\u2019s administrators appear to\nbe unsure of how to deal with the sit-uation. After keeping quiet for a few\ndays, reddit\u2019s CEO posted an internal\nmemo that announced that reddit\nwill not ban legitimate investigative\njournalism. In the memo, the CEO\nwrote that \u201c[they] stand for the freedom of speech\u201d while continuing to\nban any attempts at doxxing. He recognises that the banning of Gawker\nsites on reddit has not put the site in\na good light and that it would be ine\ufb00ective in preventing the spread of\nthe news. he site owners still seem\nto be rather unsure on how they are\ngoing to handle the situation. hey\nare playing a di\ufb03cult game trying to\nbalance between the aspects of free\nspeech: where does one draw the line\n(or even if there is a need to draw the\nline) between acceptable and unacceptable content? Add this to the\nfact that reddit is trying not to commit the same mistakes that led to the\ndownfall of one of their competitors,\nDigg, and you can see how hard it is\nfor them to toe the line.\nhe face of the controversy, Michael Brutsch, seems to be taking\nthings well. Other than allegedly losing his job, he has turned to CNN to\napologise for his actions whilst defending himself by saying that \u201c[he]\nwas playing to an audience of college\nkids\u201d. He admitted getting \u201ca thrill\u201d\nwhen posting content on reddit. he\nuser drama on reddit is no less ex-citing. Brutsch has since deleted his\naccount, and in doing so, dragged a\nnumber of other less known, though\nno less prominent, users into some\nsort of a drama. his drama is documented fully by a user on reddit no\nless!\nFree speech is problematic. Does\none have an unlimited right to say\nhis mind? If so, does he have to face\nthe consequences of his right to say\nanything? Should we curtail free\nspeech to prevent any form of rac-ism, harass, abuse, or sexism? he\nUnited Kingdom is struggling with\nthis issue over the various \u201cTwitter\narrests\u201d whilst internet communities\nlike reddit are also struggling with\nthis issue over questionable content.\nCommonly, the issue of free speech\nin this digital age arises from a single\nsource: the web. he web has empowered us all with a voice, but how\nshould we wield that voice?\nReddit are having a pretty hard time at the moment, as demonstrated above with their new logo. See what I did there? I totally turned that upside down frown upside down.\nReddit: Freedom of speech?\nYong Wen Chua summarises the controversy currently plaguing Reddit\n\u201c\u201d\nShould we curtail free speech\nto prevent any\nform of racism,\nharass, abuse,\nor sexism?\n\n"

Is this thing on?\nIt\u2019s been a while, you\nsee. In fact, by my\ncount less than half\nof the undergraduates\nwere around the last time I wrote for\nFelix. I\u2019d do a formal introduction\nand all, but the concept boils down\nto a pretty simple \u201cI vehemently hate\nmore things before breakfast than\nyou\u2019ve managed to mildly dislike in\nyour entire life\u201d schtick. I\u2019ve just been\na little preoccupied lately to write in\nFelix. I\u2019ve kept busy, of course, thanks\nfor asking. I\u2019ve taken to just whispering swear words to people on the\ntube on the commute home. Similar\naudience size, but admittedly less\nanonymous.\nOriginally, you see, I used to joke\nabout hilariously large-scale things,\nin an attempt to be so o\ufb00ensive that\npeople would be cajoled into writing\ninto the Comment section. My \ufb01rst\nH\nAngry Geek is back\nHopefully it\u2019ll go better than that time Mike Tyson returned\nyear writing included pieces which \u2013\nand it\u2019s hard to list these sarcastically,\nbut bear with me \u2013 endorsed the\nabuse of South American economies,\nsuggested we take the vote away from\nwomen and recommended demolishing the entire of the College as a\nstatement about Green Week. You\u2019d\nbe surprised how few people wrote\nin. At one point I o\ufb00ered \ufb01fty quid\nof my own money and even that only\nconvinced a half-dozen people to pen\na comment piece.\nAs with all gimmicks, though, eventually they take on a life of their own,\nand before I knew it I was writing\nabout real things that were going on at\nImperial, real irritations and obscene\nregularities of Imperial life. hings\nlike an increasingly smug attitude towards the poor being demonstrated\nby a worrying number of students.\nhings like the scary, dystopian obsession with some of the world\u2019s best\nscience and engineering graduates being funnelled into whoever o\ufb00ered the\nbiggest pay packet. hings like a tacit\nacceptance of sexism and xenophobia\nthat permeates many of the student\nsubcultures here.\nhese things still hang in the air at\nImperial years later, like particularly\nadhesive farts from the arse of a bigoted and unlikeable dung beetle. It\u2019s\nnot that I somehow \ufb01gured I had so\nmuch in\ufb02uence that merely by mentioning them the Rector would take\naction against them. hey\u2019d been going on for many years before I arrived\nhere, and they\u2019ll continue many years\nafter I\u2019ve left. It\u2019s more that I see just as\nfew people seem to care about them as\nthey did six years ago when I started\nwriting this column for the \ufb01rst time.\nhat matters.\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to pop in\nmuch this year, but I\u2019d like to. In case\nI don\u2019t, let me try a di\ufb00erent tack this\ntime in getting people to debate and\ntalk in this great section of Felix: Imperial needs people to speak up and\ntalk about its problems. It needs people who are unhappy about the way\none of the greatest universities in the\nworld conducts itself to stand up and\nmake their opinion clear. Every single\nperson reading Felix is an adult, a citizen of voting age who can go and get a\nmortgage, get married and go and die\nin the army tomorrow should they so\nwish. his is not an institution run by\ngrown-up men and women who know\nbetter than you: you are paying to be\neducated and the way this university\noperates every day re\ufb02ects on you.\nhere is no better place to make your\nviews clearer than Felix, so write in\nnow and speak your mind.\nhough obviously, if you\u2019re wrong\nI\u2019ll write in swiftly the week after and\nbite your fucking head o\ufb00.\nIt\u2019s good to be back.\nmeans that I am dumb and shallow. I am\nnot either of those things, but I do process\ninformation more slowly than the rest of\nyou. In fact it has taken me all day to \ufb01gure out how to respond to your use of the\nR-word last night.\nI thought \ufb01rst of asking whether you\nmeant to describe the President as someone who was bullied as a child by people\nlike you, but rose above it to \ufb01nd a way to\nsucceed in life as many of my fellow Special Olympians have.\nhen I wondered if you meant to describe him as someone who has to struggle\nto be thoughtful about everything he says,\nas everyone else races from one snarkey\nsound bite to the next.\nFinally, I wondered if you meant to\ndegrade him as someone who is likely to\nreceive bad health care, live in low grade\nhousing with very little income and still\nmanages to see life as a wonderful gift.\nBecause,Ms.Coulter,thatiswhoweare\n\u2013 and much, much more.\nAfterIsawyourtweet,Irealizedyoujust\nwanted to belittle the President by linking\nhim to people like me. You assumed that\npeople would understand and accept that\nbeing linked to someone like me is an insult and you assumed you could get away\nwith it and still appear on TV.\nI have to wonder if you considered other\nhateful words but recoiled from the back-lash.\nWell, Ms. Coulter, you, and society,\nneed to learn that being compared to people like me should be considered a badge\nof honor.\nNooneovercomesmorethanwedoand\nstill loves life so much.\nCome join us someday at Special\nOlympics. See if you can walk away with\nImperial College\u2019s Careers Advisory\nService being tarnished by handling\ntheir money disturbs me. I would\nsuggest all proceeds raised through\nproviding said services to Glencore\nbe donated to Save The Children\nand that the company is no longer\npromoted to students by either the\nUnion or the College, until such a\ntime that Glencore stop utilising\nchild labour, and drop whatever\npitiable excuse they are currently\nusing to justify it.\nMatt Allinson, via email\nSir,\nI\u2019ve been reading the back section of Felix with great interest since the hangman rape joke \ufb01asco last year, and\nI have to say I\u2019m pretty disappointed\nat how little has changed. In the past\nweek you have used the work \u201cgay\u201d and\n\u201cretarded\u201d as an insult several times.\nhis simply is not acceptable, I really\nhope that you can change these things\nin time for the issue next week.\nhis was addressed to Ann Coulter,\nbut I believe its message applies just as\nwell to Twatter.\n\u201cDear Ann Coulter,\nCome on Ms. Coulter, you aren\u2019t dumb\nand you aren\u2019t shallow. So why are you\ncontinually using a word like the R-word\nas an insult?\nI\u2019m a 30 year old man with Down syndrome who has struggled with the public\u2019s\nperception that an intellectual disability\nSir,\nIt undoubtedly came as a great surprise today, upon viewing the latest\nJames Bond \ufb01lm Skyfall, to see that the\nEditor-in-Chief of this very publication\nis forging an acting career on the side! I\nvery much enjoyed his performance as\nQ. His rapport with Daniel Craig was\none of the \ufb01lm\u2019s many highlights. I look\nforward to his further thespianism\nwith great interest!\nAnonymous, via email\nSir,\nI would be interested to know how\nmuch Glencore is paying to hire a\nstall at the Imperial Careers Fair\n(Wednesday 31st of October). I\nwould also be interested in knowing\nhow much Felix was paid for their\nfrankly bizarre looking advert on\nlast week\u2019s back page. I am a man of\nfew morals and even fewer princi-ples, but one thing I cannot abide by\nis child abuse. Glencore have a well-documented history of pre-Victorian\nstyle labour practices in countries\nwhere there are no law enforcement agencies to stop them (Google:\n\u201cGlencore, Democratic Republic of\nCongo, Child Labour\u201d for a spot of\nlight reading) and the thought of\ntwo noble institutions; Felix and\nyour heart unchanged.\nA friend you haven\u2019t made yet,\nJohn Franklin Stephens, Global Messenger Special Olympics Virginia\u201d\nMaybe think twice about publishing\nmaterial (even in Hangman, and yes, I\nunderstand that it\u2019s supposed to be of-fensive) that uses derogatory language\ntowards people whose lives are already\nhard enough as it is.\nhis applies to using gay as an insult too. I believe that you\u2019re intelligent\nenough to be humorous without making fun of oppressed minorities. Give it\na go!\nLizzie Campbell (LGBT Welfare\nOfficer), via email\nEditor\u2019s Reply:\nHi Lizzie,\nI\u2019ve thought for a long time about this,\nwhich is why I\u2019m replying so late.\nI apologise for any o\ufb00ence caused.\nHangman is just meant to be funny, not\no\ufb00ensive. All the writers and I want to\ndo is have a section where anyone can\nwrite something funny; the hope is that\npeople will laugh and enjoy a welcome\nbreak from seriousness. Humour sometimes toes a line.\nHaving thought about it, I don\u2019t think\nthat the use of the word \u201cgay\u201d in Twatter\na while ago was o\ufb00ensive. It was completely in context and in character for\nthe politicians in that week to talk to\neach other like that. It was used in reference to an unimaginative way of changing people\u2019s Facebook status when they\nleave themselves logged in.\nhe word \u201cretard\u201d again was used in\ncontext of the characters. Part of the\nwhole joke of Twatter is that these serious people are behaving and acting like\nteenagers on the Internet. Much like a\nshow like he Inbetweeners may use\nlanguage like that for dialogue.\nMaybe you can say it is normalising\nsomething as an insult to use it, and\ntherefore enforcing a view that it is a\nbad thing. However, I think that the language used in Twatter is just re\ufb02ecting\nand parodying today\u2019s society.\nTim Arbabzadah (Editor-in-Chief)\nShouting the below text?\n\u201cI THINK THAT\nEVERYBODY\nHAS AN INCORRECT OPINION!\u201d\nGreat.

A hurricane\nfrom the south meets a winter storm\nUK GDP figures: a turn for the better?\nLast week, the O\ufb03ce for National\nStatistics released their \ufb01rst estimate\nfor the economic growth of the UK\neconomy in the months of July, August\nand September, known as the third\nquarter. Somewhat unexpectedly, a\n1% rise in the GDP of the country was\nannounced. Given the excuses given\nby the Chancellor, George Osborne,\nfor previous falls ranging from the\nweather to the royal wedding, using\nthe Olympics as a reason for growth\ndoes not seem so far fetched.\nAll of the Olympic and Paralympic\nticket sales were counted in this\nquarter\u2019s economic output, and the\nONS predict that approximately 0.2%\nof the growth is solely down to ticket\nsales, with the boost to employment\nand creative industries harder to\nestimate. Of course these \ufb01gures are\nonly an estimate, and as we have seen\nin previous quarters, they can be\nrevised down.\nA 1% rise on its own in the UK\u2019s\ncurrent economic situation is a good\nthing, and suggests that we have left\nthe second dip of recession. It is also\nthe largest growth seen in one quarter\nfrom the west (a la Gone with the\nWind), but a polar system from the\nnorth is added to the fray. And a full\nmoon, for those extra high tides, as\nwell!\nMinus the werewolves and the\nsuperstitious business of it being\nHalloween and all, Sandy still seems\nset to be a record killer and coster.\nEnter election.\nAs circumstantial as it seems,\nSandy will make some di\ufb00erence to\nthe election. For starters, it is largely\ne\ufb00ecting the northeast of the good old\nUS of A. Making landfall in New Jersey,\nthe storm is expected to spread to the\nnorth, \ufb01lling up the periphery with\nseveral feet of snow and centimeters\nof showers. That being said, it\u2019s\nimportant to note that the northeast\nvotes predominately Democrat. So will\nObama stand to lose some support?\nShort answer, no. Though there\nmight be lower turnout at the polls,\nas one could expect in weather as\napocalyptic as Sandy, Obama still\ntouts at least a ten-point lead in most\nnortheastern states.\nAlso, as the incumbent, Obama\nstands to pro\ufb01t from this hellish storm\nsystem. That is, if he plays his cards\nsince the \ufb01nancial crisis began in\n2007. George Osborne is of course\ndelighted that the economy seems\nto be responding to his budgetary\nmeasures, but Labour spokespeople\nare wary of this analysis, given that the\npackage of tax increases and spending\ncuts (worth about 4% of GDP) are only\ncoming into e\ufb00ect in January 2013,\nand that many of the reasons given for\nthis quarter\u2019s growth are temporary.\nIn other G8 countries such as\nGermany and France, growth in the\n2nd quarter of 2012 was slow or non-existent, 0.3% and 0.0% respectively,\ncompared with -0.7% in the UK for\nthe same period. The predicted rise\nof 1.0% in the UK GDP in the third\nquarter is an even more surprising\nresult because of this, and the French\npredictions of a contraction of 0.9% in\ntheir GDP for this quarter. All of these\n\ufb01gures mean that the EU predicts the\n27 member states will see overall no\nchange in the GDP of the region across\n2012, whereas the UK alone would see\na 0.5% rise. Given our unemployment\n\ufb01gures and our continued decline\nin manufacturing and construction\nsectors, it is hard to see how this\nposition can be maintained for the UK\neconomy compared to manufacturing\ngiants, such as Germany.\nEd Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, has\nsuggested that this growth is fragile,\nand the government must remain\nwary of threats to its stability, such as\nGreece bailing out of the Eurozone, or\nthe e\ufb00ects of hurricane Sandy hitting\nthe Caribbean and the East Coast of\nthe USA on the global economy. The\nConservatives are also cautiously\noptimistic about the UK\u2019s chances of\nstaying out of recession and falling\ninto a triple dip recession for the \ufb01rst\ntime in UK economic history.\nWith growth in the economy and\njobless rates tentatively down in\nthe last quarter (although this does\ninclude part-time and temporary\nwork), signs are that the UK is slowly\non the mend, but with more public\nspending cuts on the horizon, will\nthe recovery continue? Christine\nLagarde, Managing Director of the\nInternational Monetary Fund, has\ncalled for austerity measures to be\nslowed down, else risking economic\ngrowth. The IMF has changed the way\nthey estimate the e\ufb00ects of austerity\nmeasures away from the method\nused by the British Treasury, so that\na contraction of approximately 0.9%\nto 1.7% will be felt across Europe if\nausterity measures continue.\nWhilst these \ufb01gures are only\nestimates, and no one knows who has\nthe correct interpretation, each party\nwill argue that they have the correct\nplan. Our fragile economy is in their\nhands.\nright:awell-managedandquickly\ufb01xed\ndisaster could give him an extra boost.\nCool brow, yet warm and comfortable\nrhetoric, Obama could make himself\nseem as the modest savior/rebuilder of\nthe northeast.\nThis resonates much wider than just\nthis region. One only needs to think\nof 2005, when hurricane Katrina ran\namok not only on the levees of New\nOrleans, bringing on \ufb02ooding not\nseen since Noah, but also on Bush\u2019s\npopularity ratings. His perceived\nWill Obama\nstand to lose\nsome support?\nMSNBC\nWrite for\nPolitics!\nIt doesn\u2019t all end with the US\nelection. The EU is in turmoil,\nChina is changing leadership and\nthe British government doesn\u2019t\nknow how to count.\nInterested? Email us!\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nine\ufb00ective response and lackadaisical\napproach to the whole crisis de\ufb01ned\nhis second term in o\ufb03ce. Obama\nshouldn\u2019t and, if he wants to win the\nelection, can\u2019t let this brewing crisis go\nunnoticed.\nFortunately for Obama, Romney\nis not helping himself out. While the\nincumbent is seen as spending his time\norganizing disaster relief, Romney\nis criticizing the Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency, FEMA, the\nfederal institution providing help\nto those states that do not have the\nReuters\nA visual metaphor for\nMitt Romney\u2019s campaign\nmeans to \ufb01x the mess that Sandy has\nleft behind. This doesn\u2019t bode well\nfor his chances in the northeast and\ndiminishes his chances in the bad-weather magnets in the south.\nRomney has cancelled events out of\nrespect for those in the storm\u2019s path\nand tried to in\ufb02uence his supporters\nto donate to the relief e\ufb00ort. That\nis worth note. But lacking Obama\u2019s\ncontrol of the situation, there is really\nlittle else Romney can do.\nIt seems like Sandy and Obama are a\nmatch made in heaven.\nIf I just let one rip\nreally quietly, noone will notice...\n\n"

The following year, the Southbank\nCentre curated a week-long festival dedicated to him, where audiences were\ntreated to his vast repertoire ranging from piano, percussion and tape perfor-mances, to a series of recorded lectures where the composer\u2019s unique vision of\nmodernmusicisstunningtobehold.SomeofhisinstructionsforimprovisedcollaborationarestronglyreminiscentofJohnCage:\u201cPlayavibrationintherhythm\nof your body; of your heart; of your breathing; of your thinking; of your intuition;ofyourenlightenment;oftheuniverse.\u201dOthercompositionsareofbaffling\nambition, such as his Helicopter String Quartet.

Archie \ufb01rst caught\npeople\u2019s eye last year with the track\n\u2018Out Getting Ribs\u2019, and a self-titled EP\nthat blended jazzy, dissonant chords\nand the emotional ache of the blues\nwith spoken words of existential dis-content.\nBut after that release and a small\nset of gigs in the States and at European festivals, Marshall dropped o\ufb00\nthe map completely until now, playing a set of three shows ending with\nhis \ufb01rst London gig in nearly a year\nat Electrowerkz on October 18th.\nhe venue was a small, low-key place,\nbuilt into an arch in Angel, with art\nschool kids hanging out at the stage,\nwrapped up in sketching in their\nMoleskines.\nhe support act was another young\nband called Haraket, who blended a\nrange of musical in\ufb02uences to produce some interesting and experimental sounds that channeled everything from post-dubstep to spanish\njazz. heir live mix of physical and\npad drums, guitar, synths and a\nmuted trumpet seemed noisy at \ufb01rst,\nbut quickly settled down into some\npromising and more complex tracks.\nAs the crowd milled around before\nthe main act, we noticed Marshall\nhimself chilling out in the neighbouring bar, but felt too starstruck to approach with anything meaningful to\nsay. Our frustration didn\u2019t last for\ntoo long, though, as he was soon on\nthe stage. he contrast was astound-ing; he looked frail and delicate, with\nstrikingly red hair and bright green\neyes, but when he spoke, his deep\nvoice was slow and assured, bringing to mind a wise, wounded warrior.\nWords were used sparingly; \u201cHello,\nLondon\u201d, and \u201chank you for coming\u201d are the few he uttered aside from\nsong titles. he transformation was\ncomplete when they launched into\na \ufb01erce rendition of \u2018Has his Hit\u2019,\na track written when Marshall still\nwent by the name Zoo Kid.\nIt was an astounding opening: \u2018Has\nhis Hit\u2019 pulls through a range of\nemotions the presence of which was\nfelt more strongly and completely\nlive. It set the tone for the rest of the\ngig, as they wound through a set list\ncovering everything from the EP, early Zoo Kid tracks and the latest single\n\u2018Rock Bottom\u2019.\nDuring the chorus of \u2018Baby Blue\u2019, a\ncry from the crowd went out: \u201cYou\nguys are fucking beautiful!\u201d. A product of the moment, this honest expression seems to perfectly capture\nour notion of King Krule \u2013 expansive\nsound and voice (he describes his\nmusic as a soundscape) which, combined with lyrics that brim over with\nexistential re\ufb02ection and profound\nsadness, paints a portrayal of bleak\nurban existence and brings to the\nsurface something that is both, heartbreaking and beautiful.\nWinticketstoOuiLoveExchange\nA night of some of the newest\nFrench acts is about to rock up onto\nthe shores of the Great that is Britain in an attempt to maintain the\nonly reputation for which France is\nunconquerable: electronic music.\nOui Love Exchange shows their\nsupport for three new bands hoping to follow in the steps of past\npromoted acts such as The Shoes,\nAnoraak, and Kitsun\u00e9 golden boys\nHousse de Racket.\nJupiter are a groovy two piece\nhailing from Paris who have so far\nreleased an EP entitled Juicy Lucy\n(Needs a Boogieman) and whose\nsound are described by the Exchange as \u201cdisco and electro-funk\u201d\n- pretty spot on.\nIf you are looking for \u201csomething\nakin to a new wave Scott Walker\u201d,\nJuveniles should be right up your\nstreet.

It tells the story\nof the Austrian construction worker\nand former football goalkeeper Joseph Bloch, beginning abruptly with\nthe protagonist being \ufb01red from his\ncurrent job: at least, this is what Bloch\nunderstands when he notices that\nonly one of his colleagues looks at\nhim upon his arrival at the construction site. his reaction, devoid of any\nrational justi\ufb01cation, immediately immerses the reader in the particular atmosphere of the novel.\nA spoiler alert should probably\nmake an appearance at this point, as\nI am about to reveal the story\u2019s turning point: but the truth is, the unfolding of events is the last concern one\nshould have when reading this book.\nRather, what matters is the way that\nall happenings are approached and\ninterpreted by the main character \u2013\nthe novel really takes place in Bloch\u2019s\nconsciousness, perception and feelings (or absence thereof). After a romantic night with a cinema clerk in\nVienna, he spends the morning in her\ncompany and, suddenly, strangles her.\nHe then leaves the city and reaches a\nsmall town on the southern border.\nHere he spends several days, while\nseemingly random signs, barely acknowledged by Bloch, tell us that the\ninvestigations on the girl\u2019s death are\nslowly leading to him.\nDuring this time we get to know\nBloch and the absurd, dreadful anxiety that pervades him. he latter\nmanifests itself in di\ufb00erent ways. For\none, the predictable paranoia of the\nfugitive; but this is relatively mild.\nA major part of Bloch\u2019s mental processes denote a cold detachment from\nthe world. his is not due to a conscious estrangement on his part, but\nto an obsessive tendency to search\nfor meaning in the objects he sees\nand people he meets, along with his\nincapacity of \ufb01nding it. His interpretation of external events is free and\nirrational (like when he assumes he\nhas been \ufb01red at the beginning of the\nnovel). his is particularly evident in\nhis interactions with other people,\ncharacterized by a sense of unreality,\nas if seen through a thick lens. here\nare rare exceptions: Bloch indulges\nin provoking others into \ufb01ghts, especially after a few drinks, and in those\ninstances he seems to forget himself\nand be immersed in the events. his\nis brilliantly and simply translated by\nthe author into a lack of the usual descriptive frenzy.\nBloch is compelled to spend large\nchunks of his time maniacally noting\ndetails about his surroundings. his\nis accompanied by his perception of\nlanguage as arti\ufb01cial, absurd and disconnected from reality. He often tries\nto describe things he sees with words,\nbut these always fail him. A passage\nreads: \u201cBloch grew nervous. On one\nhand this intrusiveness of the surroundings when his eyes were open,\non the other the intrusiveness, worse\nyet, of words for the surrounding ob-jects, when he closed his eyes!\u201d. Everything appears to him present in that\nplace and time for an obscure reason\nunknown to him, and every attempt\nto make sense of things, to make them\naccessible again through language\nand description only contributes to\nincreasing his sense of alienation.\nhe book\u2019s last pages are worth a\nthorough look. he story is truncated\nso that we don\u2019t know if Bloch gets arrested (although it is the most probable conclusion). he last scene takes\nplace by a small-town football pitch.\nBloch is talking to another specta-tor, and he invites him to try out an\nexercise: when a team is attacking,\nto concentrate on watching the opposing goalkeeper and observe his\nmovements rather than the strikers\nand the ball. I think what is meant\nhere is that Bloch feels, in the world,\njust like that goalkeeper on the pitch,\ncondemned to respond to something\nremoved and detached from him. At\nthe end, a penalty kick is awarded: the\ngoalie stays still and the ball is kicked\ninto his hands. And like him, Bloch\nthe murderer does not try to escape:\nbut accepts that no movement is possible in response to a world that has\nbecome meaningless and stranger to\nhim.\nhe novel \ufb01ts into a tradition of\nworks through which the authors\nhave wanted to convey human anxi-ety, inadequateness and estrange-ment; the creeping feeling that true\nunderstanding and communication is\nimpossible \u2013 or a mere arti\ufb01ce. It invites comparisons with Camus\u2019 Stranger and, in more recent times, John\nBanville\u2019s he Book of Evidence. It is a\ncompelling and interesting book, and\nleaves the reader with a disturbing\nuneasiness inside.\nP\nPeter Handke is a renowned\navant-garde novelist and playwright\nBOOKS\nBooks Editor: Maciej Matuszewski\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n39\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER\nEmail us your book reviews, author\nprofiles and other book related fea-tures.\nbooks.feilx@imperial.ac.uk\nWANT TO SEE YOUR NAME\nIN PRINT?\nI really need to pee,\nbut the toilet is just\nso far away.

    "content": "NEWS\nUni applications fall\nFigures released by UCAS (Universi-ties and Colleges Admissions Service)\nover the summer show that almost\n44,000 less home students applied\nto study at UK universities for 2012\nentry than did for 2011 entry, representing a drop of 8.7%. UCAS analysis\nsuggests that, accounting for changes\nin population size and long term application patterns, 15,000 less individuals have applied than had been\nexpected to.\nScience subjects do seem to have\nsu\ufb00ered the least compared to the\narts. Physics, for example, actually\nsaw an increase of 8.3% from last\nyear. Other, smaller, subjects, such as\nBiotechnology, even saw an increase\nof about 20%. However, as less people do the subject, it takes a smaller\nnumber of people to increase to make\na large looking \ufb02uctuation. Mechanical Engineering and Biology were the\nother science subjects to see a rise\nin demand. All other scienti\ufb01c disciplines had a dip in applications. Civil\nengineering was the worst hit, with\na decrease of 12.1%. his comes at\na time when he Royal Academy of\nEngineering reported that there is a\ndanger of there being a shortfall in\nthe number of engineering graduates.\nhe report stated that 100,000 engineering graduates a year were needed\nto maintain the status quo, with Professor Matthew Harrison of the Royal\nAcademy of Engineering saying that\n\u201cEngineering \ufb01rms are crying out for\nengineers\u201d.\nAt about 42,000 less students applying than in 2011, most of the decrease\nis accounted for by those resident\nin England. From 2012 they may be\ncharged up to \u00a39,000 a year to study\nat any UK university. he average fee\nthis year is \u00a38,385 this year, which is\nexpected to rise to \u00a38,507 next year.\nScottish universities do not charge\nany fees to Scottish students while\nfees at universities in Northern Ireland are capped at \u00a33,465 for students\ndomiciled there. he Welsh assembly pays all fees above \u00a33,465 for any\nWelsh student studying at any UK\nuniversity. Application numbers from\nthese parts of the UK have remained\nrelatively stable.\nResearch by the Guardian, however,\nfound that most young people are still\nplanning to undertake some form of\nhigher education. Furthermore analysis by the Independent Commission\non Fees found that application rates to\nthe most prestigious Universities have\nremained constant and the decline in\napplication numbers that there has\nbeen \u201cgreatest in the most advantaged\nneighbourhoods\u201d which indicated\nthat \u201cany potential impact from higher tuition fees does not appear to be\nhaving a disproportionate impact on\nthose\u201d who are worst o\ufb00.\nApplications\npeaked in 2011\nand now fall\nWarning over\nshortage of\nengineers\nMaciej Matuszewski Reporter\nNews Editor: Aemun Reza\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nMore student cuts\nMore student cuts for Imperial\nstudents at South Kensington\u2019s\nFRESH Hairdressers.\nMen\u2019s cuts \u00a322\nWomen\u2019s shampoo and cut\nand shake dry \u00a328\nWomen\u2019s shampoo, cut and\nblow-dry \u00a338\nAll of our cuts are done by\nhighly experienced stylists.\nTuesday to Fridays 9.30 to\n4.30 (sorry no discounts on\nSaturdays).\nWe are only 70 metres from\nSouth Kensington tube station\nSponsored Editorial\nDiscount haircuts for Imperial\nstudents at Fresh Hairdressers\nTo book an appointment,\ncall 0207 823 8968.

He believes that some\nof those who did not apply this year\nmight well \u201ccome back next year\u201d \u2014\nparticularly given the poor state of the\njobs market. Universities minister David Willets added: \u201cWe do accept that\nafter a peak last year, applications are\ndown from 31.6% of people applying\nto university to 30.6%. hat is actually\nstill the second highest rate of applications on record. We still have very\nstrong demand for university.\u201d\nOthers reactions to the \ufb01gures has\nbeen more critical. Shadow universities minister Shabana Mahmood said\nthat \u201cIt is clear that the drastic increase in fees and the increased debt\nburden is putting people of all ages\no\ufb00 going to university and investing\nin their future. Most students will be\npaying o\ufb00 their debts most of their\nworking lives.\u201d Even Hutton admitted\nthat: \u201cWe\u2019re asking our young men\nand women to assume more debt than\nany other country in the world \u2013 it\u2019s\nhigher than the average debt in the\nUS. It\u2019s not clear whether those lost\nthis year will return to the fold next\nyear, or [if] it\u2019s a storm warning of a\nworrying trend.\u201d\nLast week, Felix reported that students had found their way onto the\nroof of Beit using the sheer mental\npower provided to the excellent students of this institution. Stephwen\nHughes, Head of Health, Safety & Fire\nat Imperial College London, followed\nup with the following statement:\n\u201cStudents have placed themselves\nat considerable risk by deliberately\nbreaching the measures put in place\nby the College to prevent unauthorised persons accessing hazardous ar-eas. he measures including window\nrestrictors and controlled access doors\nare there for the safety and wellbeing\nof sta\ufb00 and students who will not be\naware of the risk presented by the roof\nand balconies.\nI would take this opportunity to remind students that they have a duty,\nunder health and safety law and College policy, to co-operate fully with all\nmeasures put in place by the College\nto safeguard their safety and well-being. hey are also responsible for\ntheir own safety and that of others\nwho could be a\ufb00ected by their acts or\nomissions.\nhe College will now put additional\nmeasures in place to avoid a repeat of\nsuch an incident.\nTim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief\nUCAS\nFirst years now\npaying the\n\u00a39000 fees\nScience\nsubjects are hit\nthe least\nOverseas\napplications up.\nHome down.\nAbove is a table of the number of applications.

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHow do you deal with a heartbreak?\nSomepeoplegoandpartyitaway.Others\nmerge with their sofas until the tears dry\nout and some develop a freakish emotional attachment to a spinning bike\u2026\nhat\u2019s what happened to Clement,\nyour French spinning class teacher. I\u2019m\nsaying \u2018your\u2019 because the comedy Sink\nor Shpin, which ran from 10-27 October\nat Boom Cycle studio in Shoreditch, sets\nthe audience in a spinning class. In fact,\nyou sit on an exercise bike! While this\ncould deter most of us from attending\nsuch a performance, no level of \ufb01tness is\nrequired \u2013 you can even take a beer in.\nFrom the moment you arrive, the two\nmembers of sta\ufb00 \u2013 Clement and the\n\u2018manager\u2019 of Boom Cycle \u2013 treat you as\nthough you were really going to a spinning class; giving you a locker, a water\nbottle, stretching a bit, etcetera. Co-writer and performer Donal Coonan introduces himself as Clement and his other\nhalf, spin bike Bridgette, as the new addition to Boom Cycle\u2019s spinning instructing team.\nHe left his home of Perpignan for new\nhorizonssoheslursinaheavyFrenchac-cent. We soon discover the reason for his\nmove, and throughout his \u2018seven deadly\nmodules\u2019 exercise plan we relive the ups\n(but mostly downs) of his breakup with a\ncheating ex-wife. To \ufb01ll the emptiness in\nhis life post-Emilie, Clement clings to his\nnew \ufb01tness mania: a spin bike will never\nleave you, and it always waits for you at\nhome (alone). Plus it makes you \ufb01t.\nhe whole experience is charming,\nendearing even. You have a good couple\nof laughs as Clement mends his broken\nheart and attempts to raise your heart\nrate. But unfortunately, the setting itself feels like the best part of the show. I\nfound myself expecting more. he script\nis smart and well played, but it uses a\nfew too many clich\u00e9s about breakups\nand French people and lacked any surprise factor. Let\u2019s just say I didn\u2019t fall o\ufb00\nmy bike laughing. Relying a fair bit on\ninteractions with the crowd, maybe the\nplay simply belongs in a smaller room\nthan the half-\ufb01lled professional studio of\nBoom Cycle.\nDirected and co-written by Josh\nAzouz, the piece still has been collecting hurrahs ever since it \ufb01rst played at\nthe Edinburgh Fringe in 2011. So there\nis scope to think that a Sink or Sphin\n2 could bring some wittier upheavals.\nWith that in mind, while there are no\nnext shows announced at the moment,\nI expect we will hear more from Clement and Bridgette so keep an eye on their\nwebsite www.sinkorspin.co.uk.\nTurner sur-prizes\nThe ever controversial prize succeeds this year with\nevocative and thought provoking nominees\nAlongside death and taxes, one\ncertainty in life is the controversy\ngenerated every year when the Tate\nreleases the shortlist for the Turner\nPrize. With past winners including\nDamien Hirst and Grayson Perry,\nthe shortlist has always trod the line\nbetween great and gimmicky. However this year, all the work exhibited\nis pretty incredible.\nThe exhibition starts with Paul\nNoble, whose drawings depict the\nbuildings of \u2018Nobson Newtown\u2019.\nThese are extremely detailed and\nsomewhat reminiscent of architectural plans, but with a humorous air about them. Beginning each\npiece with a word, Noble uses the\nbuildings to form that word before\nexpanding out into the intricate\nlandscape; this means that, as well\nas focussing on the finer details of\nthe drawing, the viewer must move\nfar away in order to be able to read\nthe word at the centre. There are no\npeople present in his landscapes, the\nonly vaguely human-looking figures\nbeing small blob-like forms dotted\naround.\nThe smaller details Noble places\nin his work \u2013 such as the abandoned\ntable-tennis game in Paul\u2019s Palace\n\u2013 add a depth to the drawings. The\ndesolate landscapes have a menacing air, the lack of people calling into\nquestion whether Newtown is some\nkind of post-apocalyptic wasteland.\nThe surreal wit of Newtown is best\ndescribed by Noble himself, who\ncalls it \u201ca play without acts or actors\u201d.\nLuke Fowler is the next artist to be\ndisplayed. The first of two video artists competing for the prize, Fowler\nworks mainly with archive footage,\nand subverts the traditional form of\nthe documentary film by presenting\na non-fixed, fluid view of the subject.\nHis work, All Divided Selves, is a 90\nminute long film about the Scottish\npsychiatrist R.D. Laing. Just as Fowler challenges the traditional idea of\nvideo art, Laing\u2019s ideas challenged\northodox psychiatry, championing\nthe role of social and cultural factors\nalongside biological ones. The film\nis similar to a collage, using a myriad\nof sources whilst also touching on\nissues such as social housing and\npoverty. Although it drags on a bit,\nthe film is beautifully edited, as well\nas informative. Laing is a figure who\nI had never heard of, but I left the\nviewing feeling that Fowler had not\nonly told the audience about Laing\u2019s\nFred Fyles work, but allowed us a rare insight\ninto his character.\nThe Woolworths Choir of 1979, a\n20 minute long video by Elizabeth\nPrice, is exhibited next. The beginning of the film focuses on the\nchurch choir and the area between\nthe altar and the nave. Photographs\nof wooden carvings are cut across\nby text describing the features, and\nthe entire piece is backed by clicks\nand handclaps, building up as the\npiece advances. As pictures of twisting statues are displayed, a chorus of\nvoices begin to sound and the images segue into footage of the 1960s\ngirl group The Shangri-Las writhing and wriggling to the chorus of\n\u201cOut in the Streets\u201d. The singers begin waving their hands as the music\nfades out, and then another waving\nhand appears, this time poking out\nof a window billowing with smoke.\nThis time it is a woman signalling for help at the 1979 Manchester\nWoolworths fire, which left 10 people dead. Silent footage of witnesses\nis spliced in with images of the police\nreport describing the fire and the repeated shot of the arm waving. The\nwork is evocative yet cold, beautiful and haunting, leaving the viewer\nfeeling a deep sense of unease, and\nmeriting a second viewing.\nThe final artist is the only performance artist to ever be nominated.\nSpartacus Chetwynd\u2019s work is pro-vocative; while the other works invite you to look in on another world,\nChetwynd\u2019s piece Odd Man Out literally drags the viewer in. The work\nis primitive and absurd: performers\ndressed in green rags dance around\nthe exhibition space, which has been\npapered with enormous posters, and\ninvite the audience to speak with\nthe \u2018oracle\u2019, a mandrake root puppet\nwhich whispers future predictions.\nIt feels like being in a LSD-fuelled\nam-dram class. The costumes and\nsets are homemade and the performance deliberately amateurish but\nit is completely charming and lib-erating. Chetwynd seems the most\nlikely artist for critics of the Turner\nPrize to dismiss as a publicity hungry provocateur, but her work is\nthe least heavy and the most fun of\nall the pieces shown. Whether that\nmerits a win remains to be seen.\nAll the artists shown are extremely\ntalented, and I would be happy for\nany of them to win. Art is a deeply\npersonal thing, and I urge you all to\nmake the trip down to Pimlico to decide on a winner yourself. You will\ncertainly leave entertained.\nWriter\nFRIDAY 02 NOVEMBER 27\nPedal\npowered\ncomedy\nLuke Fowler, All Divided Selves, 2011 \u00a9 Alan Dimmick\nSpartacus Chetwynd, Odd Man Out, 2011 \u00a9 Sadie Coles HQ\nPublic Toilet, Paul Noble, 1999\u00a9 Paul Noble, Gagosian Gallery\nEmilie Beauchamp Writer\nMountain gets more action than Imperial boys\nImperial College\u2019s\nNext Top Model\nDon\u2019t let your\nfriendship die\non the road\n\n"
