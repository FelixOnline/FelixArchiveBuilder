Dark matter\nis an invisible stockpile of\nmass that we estimate to\nmake up about 27% of the\nuniverse, and our understanding is that it provides\nthe necessary gravitational forces for galaxies to\nhold themselves together.\nThis enigmatic building\nblock of the universe is\nproving highly elusive,\nyet it is almost six times as\nabundant as normal ordinary matter. The nature of\ndark matter and its effects\nare still not fully known.\nThis is indeed a hot topic\nin cosmology research, as\nstudying dark matter will\ngive us clues to the nature\nof the universe itself.\nProfessor Judd\nBowman of Arizona\nState University led the\nresearch, using Experiment to Detect the Global\nEpoch of Reionisation\nSignature (EDGES), a\nradio telescope which\nbegan recording data\nin 2015. The team\nmeasured the absorption\nlines corresponding to a\n21cm-wavelength-transi-tion of atomic hydrogen\nin spectra of distant stars\nformed as early as 180\nmillion years after the Big\nBang. The data show there\nis a stronger absorption\nsignal corresponding to\nthis 21cm transition than\nexisting models predict.\nAccording to Professor\nRennan Bakana of Tel\nAviv University in a paper\nin Nature last week, this\nis conclusive in showing\nthere were interactions\nbetween dark matter\nand ordinary matter in\nthe early universe. The\nevidence suggests dark\nmatter is generally \u2018cold\u2019,\nor highly non-relativistic,\nmeaning that its speed\ndoes not come close to\nthe speed of light in a\nvacuum. Another pivotal\nrevelation in the study is\nthat dark matter seems to\nbe composed of low-mass\nparticles which are no\nheavier than a couple\nof proton masses. \u201cThis\ninsight alone has the\npotential to reorient the\nsearch for dark matter,\u201d\nsays Professor Bakana.\nDark matter appears\nto have cooled down the\ncosmic gas in the early\nuniverse, and so we may\ndeduce that dark matter\n\u201cProfessor\nBakana,\nwriting in\nNature, said\nthe insight had\n\u201cthe potential\nto reorient the\nsearch for dark\nmatter\u201d\n\u201cConsensus\namong\nacademics\nseems to\nbe that\ndark matter\nparticles are\nprobably\nsomething\nyet to be\ndiscovered\u201d\nis at least moderately\ncold. However, velocities\npredicted by warm dark\nmatter are potentially\ndetectable. This is a focal\npoint in this field, as many\nfavour the idea that dark\nmatter manifests a combination of hot, cold, and\nwarm behaviours. The\nevidence so far puts cold\ndark matter as the leading\nculprit, and the best\ncandidate for the particle\nis the weakly interacting\nmassive particle (WIMP).\nAs its name suggests,\ndark matter is invisible\nin the electromagnetic\nspectrum, so does not\ninteract with the electromagnetic force; for\ndark matter to have substantial electrodynamic\nand nuclear interactions\nwould go against well-un-derstood cosmological\nmodels including the Big\nBang. The consensus\namong academics seems\nto be that dark matter particles are probably something that are yet to be\ndiscovered, that uniquely\ninteract gravitationally\nwith ordinary matter.\nStudying dark\nmatter may well give us\ninformation about how\nthe universe came to be,\nand how it may end. The\nconcept of dark matter is\naround a century old, yet\nwe still do not know that\nmuch about it. General\nrelativity on the other\nhand, which has been\naround for a similar time,\nis well-established with its\nprinciples utilised in GPS.\nFurther comparable radio\ntelescope projects include\nthe Hydrogen Epoch of\nReionisation (HERA)\nwhich will be operational\nin the next couple of years,\nand the Low Frequency\nAperture Array (LFAA),\nwhich is 2km in diameter,\nconsisting of millions of\nantennae erected in the\nWestern Australian desert.\nIt should be operational\nthis year. Once these\ntelescopes can replicate\nresults seen by EDGES,\nwe will be able to\nconfirm that the first stars\n\u201crevealed\u201d dark matter. As\nwe the technology catches\nup with our desire to\nunderstanding, this field\nbegins to emerge into\nrelevance. Cosmologists\ncan now start working to\nprove that anything with a\n\u2018dark\u2019 in front of it is not\njust an abstract idea for\nsomething we do not yet\nunderstand, but an actual-ity.\nSpace physics is super pretty\u2026 // Wikimedia\nWords and genes\nSCIENCE\nJuan Ignacio Rubio\nGorrochategui\nScience Writer\nL\nanguage and\ngenetics do not\nusually go hand\nin hand in human\nhistory. Languages are, if\nanything, an instrument\nfor domination \u2013 the\nepitome of international\nprestige as well as commercial and political\nsupremacy. As the scholar\nof Yiddish Max Weinreich\nonce said: \u201ca language is a\ndialect with an army and\na navy\u201d. Empires rise and\nimpose their speech on the\nindividuals they conquer,\na speech that is usually\nforgotten or radically\nchanged when the next\ngeneration of conquerors\nfall on the shell of a state\nthat has initiated its decay.\nThis process happened\nin Britain, which lost\nits own homegrown\ndialect of Latin when the\nAnglo-Saxons came to the\nisland; or can be seen in\nTurkey, where Greek lost\nits place to a language that\nwas first spokes in the vast\nsteppes of Siberia. But\nwhile languages change,\nthe people do not. Many\nmodern British citizens\nare direct descendants\nof the worshippers of\nStonehenge and Turks\nfrom the soldiers that gave\nByzantium its greatest\nglories. However, while\ntheir languages faded, the\ncontinuous genetic link\nwas untouched, and the\nnewcomers provided only\nnegligible amounts of new\ngenetic material. Until\nnow, this was believed to\nbe a universal phenome-non, the only exceptions\nbeing the colonization of\nAmerica and Australia,\nwhich resulted in both\ntremendous genetic and\nlinguistic changes. And\nthen, the whole scheme\nfell apart in Vanuatu.\nVanuatu is an island\ncountry in the Western\nPacific. Not many people\nknow that the small nation\nis one of the most linguistically diverse places in\nthe world: 113 languages\nare spoken by a population\nof around 270,000. All the\nthe islands that neighbour\nNew Guinea \u2013 Vanuatu\nbeing among them. The\ngroup that moved East\ngave origin to the Lapita,\nthe ancestors of the\nfamed Polynesians who\nexplored the Pacific from\nHawaii to New Zealand.\nThus, as Vanuatu is the\nfocal point of the Lapita\nexpansion, it should be\nexpected that Vanuatuans\nare genetically close to\nother Polynesian peoples.\nInstead, they are very\nsimilar to inhabitants of\nNew Guinea, who speak\na completely different\ngroup of languages. This\nis not a strange occurrence\nin history; as explained\nbefore, conquerors usually\nimpose their languages. It\nwould not be farfetched\nto think that the original\nPapuan inhabitants of\nVanuatu were invaded by\na wave of Austronesians.\nVanuatu would then be\nanother case of language\nreplacement; however, the\npeople would still be the\nsame. Except, this time, it\nwas the other way around.\nWhen researchers from\nthe Max Planck Institute of Human History\nrecently analysed the\nremains of the earliest\ninhabitants of Vanuatu,\nthey found that they were\nindistinguishable from\nthe individuals taken in\nLapita burial sites from\nother Pacific islands, and\nquite different from the\nmodern Vanuatuans. In\nother words, it seems that\nVanuatu was colonised by\nthe neighbouring Papuans\nwho imposed their genetic\nlegacy \u2013 itself an event\nthat occurs rarely in\nhuman history. What is\nmore astonishing is that\nthe conquerors adopted\nthe language of the people\nthey replaced. This phenomenon is unprecedented in history, and points\nto slower but steady\nprocess of conquest. At\nfirst, only a few Papuans\nmoved to the islands,\nand some adopted the\nlanguage of the original\ninhabitants. As the flow of\nPapuans increased, there\nwas a gradual change\nin the genetic make-up\nof the population of the\nislands, but the languages\nremained the same. After\nthousands of years, the\ngenetic heritage of the\nAustronesians had all\nbut disappeared, but\ntheir language remained,\nspoken by the people that\nhad replaced them.\nThe special case of\nVanuatu shows facts that\nhave been long held as\nuniversal in the study\nof human populations\nare not as true as once\nthought. The complex\nrelationships between\nhuman populations are\nstill far from understood,\nand there are probably\nstill many Vanuatus in\nthe most remote parts\nof world, waiting to be\ndiscovered. Who knows\nwhat other long held foundations of anthropology\ncould be torn to shreds.\nThe fascinating genetic history of the Vanuatuan communities has finally been mapped, and it is much more\nsurprising than previously expected.\nLeft: a sign in Bislama, one of the many languages of Vanuatu; Right: a view of Vanuatu // Wikimedia\n\u201cOver 100\nlanguages are\nspoken by the\npopulation\nof 270,000 on\nVanuatu\u201d\nindigenous languages of\nVanuatubelongtotheAustronesian family, a group\nof languages that stretches\nfrom Madagascar to\nEaster Island, including\nMalay, Tagalog, and\nMaori.

I\u2019m sure\nyou couldn't tell. Just\nignore the strange stream\nof consciousness, the\nrandom spelling mistakes\n(all my copy editors have\ngone home), and the\neditor-on-the-verge-of-a-nervous-breakdown style.\nTrust me, it\u2019s all fine.\nMy Deputy Editor\nsuggested I eschew the\neditorial this week, and\nexplain I was striking in\nsolidarity with our lecturers and support staff. It\u2019s\na tempting idea, but this\nspace is really the only\nplace in the paper where\nI can express myself un-hindered. And at least one\nperson reads it (hi mum!),\nso I thought I\u2019d better do\none this week.\nThe big news came\nalong just as we were\nwinding down for the\nweek: late this afternoon,\nthe University and\nCollege Union (UCU)\nannounced they would\npotentially hold another\ntwo weeks of strike\naction if the dispute over\npensions isn\u2019t resolved.\nThey would time this to\naffect the examination and\nassessment period across\nUK universities, in a bid\nto get UUK, the universities governing body, to sit\ndown and listen.\nIf this goes ahead, it\nwill mark a stark shift in\nthe battle between UCU\nand UUK. Whereas the\nlast couple of weeks have\nbeen quite amicable on\ncampus, if UUK does not\nreach a workable compro-mise, this new wave of\nstrikes could turn nasty.\nWhile students have \u2013 in\ngeneral \u2013 been more or\nless supportive of the\nstriking staff (after all, in\nthe snow last week any\nexcuse to not head into\nuni was very welcome),\nthings could take a turn for\nthe worse as examinations\nand degree completion are\nthreatened.\nWhat I would like to\ndo, if I can, is echo some\nof the points that have\nbeen put across by staff\nand students over the\npast few weeks: firstly,\nacademics and support\nstaff aren\u2019t just striking\nfor the fun of it. These\nare a group of people who\nreally want to get involved\nwith academia, pass on\ntheir knowledge, and help\nstudents become more\nwell-rounded, fulfilled\nindividuals. Most of them\ncould get much better paid\njobs in the private sector,\nbut stay on because they\nhave a real passion for\ntheir jobs. That this strike\naction is also difficult for\nthem should be recog-nised.\nSecondly, the ultimate\nend-goal of these strikes\ngoes beyond individual\nexaminations. It also,\nreally, goes further than\nstaff pensions. If this all\nfalls apart, could be an\neducation system that \u2013\nin a few short years \u2013 is\ncompletely unrecognis-able; one that is less\nfulfilling, less enjoyable,\nand of lower quality. As\ngraduates eschew the\npublic sector for private\njobs, our universities will\nsuffer, and the students of\nthe future will suffer too.\nFinally, if you feel\npissed off, then good \u2013\nthis is what the strikes\nare designed to do, and it\nis through frustration that\ntangible change is often\nachieved. Just make sure\nyour ire is directed to\nthe right targets. Send an\nemail to the Provost. Get\nyour heads of department\nto lobby the College. And\ngive your striking staff a\nwave when they\u2019re on the\npicket line. It could make\nall the difference.\nOh, and #voteICU.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\nFelix is recruiting!\nWewantyou\u2013yes,you!We\u2019relookingforwriters,photographers,editors,illustrators,reporters,\ncomputer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.

Bands like The\nMob and Chumbawamba lived in communes\nand advocated for an\nanarchist alternative. The\nsubgenre peaked when\nCrass songs were quoted\nagainst Thatcher in Parliament, with regards to\nthe Falklands war. This,\nalong with an attempted\nprosecution by a Tory MP\nfor obscenity, prompted\nthem to call it quits. The\nband briefly reunited in\n2011 for The Last Supper,\nwhich featured a rendition\nof \u201cDo They Owe Us A\nLiving?\u201d in the original\ndrums-and-vocals style.\nMeanwhile, US punk\ndiverged. This was the era\nof hardcore.\nInspired by John\nMcLaughlin and Chick\nCorea, Mind Control\nwas formed in 1976 as\na jazz-fusion ensemble.\nExposed to punk in the\nclosing years of the\ndecade, the band recast\nitself as Bad Brains and\nbegan tearing up the DC\narea with blisteringly fast\nbeats and gritty waves of\nreggae-inspired, distorted\nskanking.\nThe DC scene was\nhuge. Minor Threat, The\nUntouchables, Government Issue, Gray Matter,\nand Dag Nasty all hail\nfrom the area.

While we\nmay think of sharks preying upon us, in this case it\nis humans that are at the\ntop of the food chain.\nShark fin soup, a traditional dish in several East\nand SoutheastAsian coun-tries, requires the usual\ningredients for a soup:\nbroth, salt, and maybe a\nmushroom or two. But,\nas the name indicates,\nit also requires shark\nfins. As animal-based\nproducts go, it is not one\nwith a pleasant collection\nmethod: fishermen catch\nindividual sharks, before\nslicing off the fins to\nbe processed, sold, and\nconsumed in the soup.\nThey are not fastidious\nabout the shark species\nwhen obtaining the fins,\nnor are they picky about\nthe treatment of the shark\nafter the fins are collected.\nThe finless individuals are\nthrown back overboard\nto face a restricted life at\nthe bottom of the ocean \u2013\nunable to swim again.\nIt may seem obvious\nthat there is the need\nto find a more ethical-ly-sourced soup to serve,\nbut shark fin soup serves\nas a status symbol, presented at several special\noccasions, one being\nweddings. The traditional\ndish originates from the\n10th\ncentury where it was\na Chinese emperor\u2019s dish\nof choice. More recently,\nit has slowly begun to\ndwindle out of fashion\nas charities, such as the\nHong Kong Shark Foundation, continue efforts\nto increase awareness of\nthe soup\u2019s preparation\nmethods.\nneyland in Hong Kong.\nHaving originally planned\non serving the soup as a\nsign of respect to local\nresidents, the corporation\nultimately decided against\nit. More recently, several\nprotests have occurred\nacross the continent at\nrestaurants serving the\nsoup with the use of\ngraphic costumes aimed\nat deterring customers\nfrom enjoying their meals.\nThere have been suggestions that shark finning\ncould help conservation\nefforts, but whether these\nclaims have legitimate\nproof or are merely\nconvenient arguments is\nyet to be seen. Given the\nmoral implications and\nother options available,\nshark fin soup seems a\nbizarre choice for a meal.\nEspecially given the fact\nthat it\u2019s tasteless!\nGrantham lecture: a topical discussion with a distinguished speaker\nF\nollowing the\ne s t a b l i s h e d\ntradition of his\npredecessors, His\nSerene Highness Prince\nAlbert II came to Imperial\nto promote ocean conser-vation. The principality of\nMonaco is known to have\nled many expeditions\nunder the leadership of\nPrinceAlbert I, the current\nprince\u2019s grandfather, and\nJacques-Yves Cousteau,\nthe famous oceanog-rapher. These include\ncreating the first modern\nbathymetric map and a\nlarge contribution to the\nstudy of the Gulf Stream.\nThe lecture, entitled\n\u201cThe climate change: a\nthreat to the oceans. The\nOcean: a chance for the\nclimate\u201d, covered the\nmain issues facing our\noceans due to pollution\nand climate change, such\nas acidification. The\nPrince spoke of the different initiatives Monaco\nhad recently put into place\nto safeguard this environ-ment, culminating in the\ncreation of World Ocean\nSummit taking place this\nyear in Mexico.\nHe outlined a three-point strategy towards a\nsolution to these issues:\nrigorous science, comprehensive protection, and a\nsustainable economy. On\nthe first point he made\nallusions to the work\nbeing done by Imperial\nand his foundation.\nHe then expressed the\nneed for leaders to urge\nreluctant states to stand\nup and safeguard the\nfragile environment that\nis our seas. Finally, the\nPrince stressed that the\nway forward was through\na Blue Economy, the\nsustainable use of ocean\nresources for economic\ngrowth, and highlighted\nhow these solutions were\nbeing implemented in\nMonaco.\nHe also mentioned\nthe accountability of\nindividuals in this crisis,\nespecially with regards\nto plastic pollution and\ntravel, and ended with\na quote from Winston\nChurchill: \u201cWhat is the\nuse of living, if it be not\nto strive for noble causes\nand to make this muddled\nworld a better place for\nthose who will live in it\nafter we are gone\u201d.\nAlthough the points\nof the lecture were\nrelevant and interesting,\nthe speaker struggled to\ngive them with panache,\nand failed to answer the\nquestions asked by the\naudience \u2013 namely how\nyoung graduates could\nbe a part of this new Blue\nEconomy. Perhaps the\nGrantham Institute should\nchoose future speakers\nwith an understanding of\ntheir topic as well as notoriety if it is to please both\nits student and staff body,\nas well as the general\npublic.\nYou can watch the\nlecture in full at: http://bit.\nly/granthamoceans.\nSCIENCE\nOlly Dove\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nKenza Tazi\nScience Writer\nProtests against shark-fin soup // Wikimedia\nPrince Albert II at UNESCO // Wikimedia\n\u201cFinless sharks\nare thrown\noverboard,\nto face a\nrestricted life\nat the bottom\nof the ocean\u201d\nThe mega-corporation\nDisney even faced the\nmoral dilemma back in\n2005, when it had to make\nthe decision on whether\nor not to serve shark fin\nsoup at its brand-new DisSCIENCE\nSteve Allain\nScience Writer\nJ\nust in times for\nValentine\u2019s Day,\na Sehuencas\nwater frog named\nRomeo had an online\ndating profile setup to\nsearch for love.

He is the\nonly known individual\nof his species, and the\nprofile was completed\nto help raise awareness\nto the plight of Romeo\u2019s\nspecies. He has been\nin captivity for almost\na decade and has been\ncalling for a mate ever\nsince. This isn\u2019t the first\ntime a lone individual\nof a species has been\nknown to science: in\nSeptember 2016, the last\nRabb\u2019s fringe-limbed\ntree frog called Toughie\npassed away from old age.\nLike Romeo, he had been\nin captivity for a long\ntime and unfortunately a\nfemale was never found\nare a number of different\nfactors which are causing\nsynergistic effects on\namphibian populations\nglobally. Currently, 41%\nof amphibian species\nare threatened with\nextinction, the highest\nrate for any group of\nvertebrates. Habitat loss,\npollution, overharvesting,\nand disease are some\nof the biggest threats\nfacing amphibians. One\nof the main diseases\nthat caused such rapid\ndeclines in both Romeo\u2019s\nand Toughie\u2019s species (as\nwell as countless others)\nis chytridiomycosis. The\ndisease is caused by a\nhighly infectious fungus,\nand has been implicated\nin the global decline of\namphibian populations.\nUnfortunately it is\nunlikely that a female\nSehuencas water frog will\never be found, despite\nthe fact that in the late\n1990s they were common\nin Bolivia. Even if one\nis found, will she be in\na suitable condition to\nbreed? Will he be too old\nby then? It\u2019s sad to think\nthat although Romeo\u2019s\ndating profile has raised\nboth awareness and funds\nto help protect other amphibians and their habitats\nin Bolivia, it\u2019s likely he\nwill suffer the same fate\nas Toughie. All hope is not\nlost as an elusive female\nmay still be out there in\nthe Bolivian wilds somewhere and hopefully she\ncan be paired with Romeo.\nWith raising threat of\nclimate change and\nother such factors how\nlong will it be until other\ncommon amphibian\nspecies across the globe\nare reduced to only a\nhandful of individuals?\nOne of the last Rabb\u2019s fringe-limbed tree frogs // Wikimedia\n\u201cRomeo has\nbeen dubbed\n\u2018the world\u2019s\nloneliest\nfrog\u2019.

The concept of the\nmale gaze was quickly\nadopted into the cultural\nlexicon because Mulvey\u2019s\nobservations transcend\nthe movies \u2013 in all forms\nof media the (cis, straight,\nwhite) male experience\nheld up as the norm, it is\nthe men who have agency,\nwomen are the objects of\nconsumption.\nThe pincer grip of the\nmale gaze on the art world\nis exposed pithily by the\nGuerilla Girls, an anonymous all-female collec-tive, in their 1989 pop-art\ninspired poster Do Women\nHave To Be Naked to Get\nInto the Met Museum\nwhich reveals that \u201cless\nthan 5% of artists in the\nModernArt section (of the\nMetropolitan Museum of\nModern Art in New York)\nare women, but 85% of\nthe nudes are female\u201d.\nThe disparity between\nwho is object and who\nis the subject matters\nbecause at its heart, the\nmale gaze is primarily\nabout power. In the arts,\nwhere the currency is\nselling a narrative or\nhaving a voice, it boils\ndowntowhogetstotellthe\nstory and in what way, and\nwho must remain a silent\ncharacter in the story told\nabout them. In a climate\nwhere the male gaze pre-dominates, women artists\nwho speak out candidly,\nnot just about wider social\nissues but their own lives\nare staging minute revolu-tions.\nOpenness, transgres-sion, and intimacy are\nat the centre of Tracey\nEmin\u2019s on-going neon\nseries. Since the 1990s she\nhas created work in which\ntubes of neon lighting are\nbent into a simulacrum of\nher handwriting to spell\nout phrases of love, loss,\nand rage. Though the\nmedium has been in use\nfor decades, Emin\u2019s work\nis memorable because\nof the sense of personal\ndisclosure her words seem\nunfiltered: I know, I know,\nI know, one piece admon-ishes, the writing getting\nbigger with each repeti-tion, the central phrase\nangrily scratched out.\nIn day-glo brights Emin\nmakes sentences, which\nseem as though they\ncould be lifted straight\nfrom a diary, intensely\npublic. Made famous by\nthe Turner-shortlisted My\nBed, she is no stranger to\nblurring the lines between\npublic and private \u2013 some\nof Emin\u2019s best work\nhas tossed aside female\nsilence \u2013 in All the People\nI\u2019ve Ever Slept With, she\nused the traditionally\nfemale craft of quilting to\ncreate a cocoon-like tent\non which the names of her\nlovers, friends and family\nare embroidered. Despite\nthe confessional nature\nof Emin\u2019s work, we are\nnever in doubt who holds\nthe power, rather than\nbeing exposed, Emin puts\nherself on display.\nThe difference between\nunflinchingly open and\nvoyeuristic work is\nevident in Jenny Saville\u2019s nudes. In her series\nClosed Contact Saville\nuses thick oils and heavy\nbrushstrokes to depict\nher naked body pressed\ntightly against clear glass,\nin extreme close up and\nat a vast scale, fat and\nmuscle slide and squash\ntogether to create unexpected shapes. Saville\ntransforms her body into\na landscape: the distorted\nswell of her abdomen\nand breasts, the curl of\nher fingers, the ridges\nof her knuckles become\na topography of fleshy\ntones. These canvases\nzing with energy, they\nare sometimes beautiful,\noften grotesque, always\ncompelling. Paintings by\nother figurative artists\nsuch as Lucian Freud who\nalso make nudes their\nfocus are rendered staid in\ncomparison.\nIn the age of social\nmedia platforms that\ndemand divulsion,\nand in a climate where\nhappily body positivity\nis becoming a little more\nwidespread, Saville and\nEmin\u2019s art is more relevant\nthan ever. However, it is\nstill depressingly difficult\nfor women artists to\nshares their voices and\nstories: when in 2012, the\nGuerilla Girls updated\ntheir statistics, 4% of the\nartists in the Modern Art\nsection of the Met. were\nwomen, but 74% of the\nnudes were female.\nThe internet has\nprovided artists the opportunity to circumvent\nold institutions altogether.\nFunded by feminist\nproduction company The\nFront, filmmaking sister\nduo Remy and Kelsey\nBennett have made it\ntheir mission to cast the\nspotlight on female artists\nthrough the documentary\nseries Under Her Skin\n(available online). In a\nseries of short episodes\nthey follow the journey\nof contemporary artists\nlooking to break out:\nfrom 17 year old Pantetha\nAbareshi who, like Frida\nKahlo did, paints to communicate and transform\nher chronic pain, to Jane\nRule Burdine, who at\nseventy-one is still active\nas a street photographer.\nIn offering the perspectives of many different\nwomen what Under Her\nSkin promotes is crucial\nin the campaign for better\nrepresentation: the imperative to honour individual,\nnuanced experiences,\nfiltered not only through\nthe lens of womanhood,\nbut a prism of intersecting\nidentities: those of class,\nculture, race, sexuality\nand age. Doing so will\nnot only give a voice to\nthose silenced for so long\nbut create a richer treasure\ntrove of art we can all\nenjoy.\nAn exploration of contemporary women artists resisting and subverting the status quo\nThe personal made public: I know i know I know, 2002 // Tracey Emin\n\n"

The\nwinners headed off to the\nafter party, cleaners began\nsweeping the theatre floor\nof discarded acceptance\nspeeches and candy wrap-pers, and film enthusiasts\nbegan a two-month period\nof hibernation before the\nCannes Film Festival\nbegins, and we start the\nwhole shebang again.\nThe Academy Awards\nare, in general, a staid\naffair, and this year was\nno different. But while\nthis should perhaps have\nbeen expected, it felt like\na let-down after what\nhas transpired over the\nprevious twelve months.\nAt the last awards\nceremony, Warren Beatty\nand Faye Dunaway made\nthe most meme-able\nmistake of their lives,\nas they mistakenly announced La La Land as\nthe Best Picture winner,\nonly for it to be revealed as\nMoonlight mere minutes\nlater. At the time, it\nseemed like the beginning\nof a sea change: here\u2019s a\nlow-budget, LGBT+ film,\nwith an all-black cast,\nwinning out over a barnstorming celebration of\nLos Angeles life \u2013 catnip\nfor the typical Academy\nvoter.\nMoonlight\u2019s win came\nafter a moderate shake-up\nof the Academy\u2019s mem-bership, which brought\ndown the average age,\nincreased diversity, and\nmade a small step towards\ngender parity. In October,\nthe membership was\nshaken even further, as\nHarvey Weinstein, the disgraced film producer, who\nhas been accused of sexual\nmisconduct by more than\n80 women, was expelled\nfrom the Academy. Since\nthen we\u2019ve had the rise of\n#MeToo and Time\u2019s Up,\nas more and more women\ntake aim at ingrained\nmisogyny within the film\nindustry.\nAs we approached this\nyear\u2019s ceremony, there\nwere signs that things\nwould be a bit different:\nfrom women wearing\nblack on the red carpet\nin protest, to Casey\nAffleck not presenting\nthe Best Actress award\namid previous sexual\nharassment accusations,\nthings were set for this\nto be a different kind of\nceremony.\nIt wasn\u2019t. Not really.\nInstead of an evening\nbanishing all the old\ncobwebs of inequality\nclinging onto the industry,\nwe had several hours of\nlip service from presenter\nKimmel (invited back for\nanother year, hopefully\nhis last), a few clapbacks\nagainst President Trump\u2019s\nxenophobic tendencies,\nand a rather predictable\nslate of award winners.\nGuillermo del Toro\u2019s\nThe Shape of Water\nemerged as the main\nwinner from the night,\nwith four awards in the\nbag,includingBestPicture\nand Best Director. They\nwere well-deserved: The\nShape of Water is a sumptuous romantic fantasy,\nconjured up from the\nimagination of a director\nworking at the height of\nhis powers, which touches\non themes like belonging\nand identity.\nCompared to the rest\nof the films up for Best\nPicture \u2013 Call Me by\nYour Name, a tender gay\ncoming-of-age drama;\nGet Out, Jordan Peele\u2019s\nfeature debut that sharply\nskewers liberal hypocrisy;\nand Lady Bird, which\nexplores the complex\nrelationship between\nmothers and daughters\nwith thrilling clarity \u2013 The\nShape of Water might\nseems middle of the road,\nbut the choice to give it\nBest Picture is still quietly\nradical. For starters, it\u2019s\na fantasy film, which the\nAcademy rarely chooses\nto endorse, instead preferring stolid drama. Furthermore, the main leads in\nthe film are a mute woman\nwho communicated only\nusing sign language, a gay\ncloseted man, and an African-American woman \u2013 as\ndiverse a line-up as any of\nthe other nominees. And\nlet\u2019s face it: it was either\nthis or Three Billboards\nOutside Ebbing, Missouri,\nso we should really just be\ngrateful.\nThere were a couple of\nsurprises thrown into the\nmix too: the Best Adapted\nScreenplay award went\nto James Ivory for Call\nMe by Your Name, which\nwas as expected, but still\na high-point of the night,\nparticularly when Call Me\nby Your Name was shut\nout of other categories\nwhere it deserved to win.\nIvory gave a touching\nspeech paying tribute to\nhis former partner Ismail\nMerchant, who died in\n2005, and with whom he\nworked in Merchant Ivory\nProductions.\nJordan Peele\u2019s win for\nBest Original Screenplay\nforGetOutwasthebiggest\nsurprise of the night, as\nhe became the first black\nscreenwriter to win in\nthe category. For Peele\nto succeed, particularly\nwhen many (us included)\nthought the award would\ngo to Martin McDonagh\u2019s\nThree Billboards, which\nhandles race topics with\nall the grace of a pick-up\ntruck navigating along a\ntightrope, was one of the\nstand-outs of an otherwise\nboring evening.\nAnother big breakthrough was the win of\nBest Foreign Language\nFilm for Chile\u2019s A Fantastic Woman, which\ncentres around the experience of a trans woman\nfollowing the death of her\nolder partner. The film is\ndriven by the intensity of\nlead actor Daniela Vega,\nwho is herself trans, and\nbecame the first transgender presenter at the Oscars\nwhen she introduced\nSufjan Stevens, performing \u2018Mystery of Love\u2019\nalongside Annie Clark\nHas anyone seen my Oscar?! // Craig Sjodin/ABC\nThe Shape of Water won big! // Fox Searchlight\nprotests, predictable jokes, predictable disappointment\n\u201cFrances\nMcDormand\nmanages to\nsalvage the\nnight with\na rousing\nspeech\u201d\nand Moses Sumney.\nOn the whole, however,\nthe Academy seemed\nmore prepared to pay\ntribute to diversity and\nequality in the form of\nlong montages that said\nlittle, rather than tangible\nchanges. While Dee Rees\u2019\nMudbound was held up as\na great example of black\nwomen making beautiful\nfilms, it was only nominated for four awards,\nand won none. One of\nthese nominations was\nfor Rachel Morrison, who\nbecame the first woman\never to be nominated for\nBest Cinematography in\nthe Academy\u2019s 90-year\nhistory \u2013 in and of itself\nan embarrassment.\nGreta Gerwig\u2019s Lady\nBird went home emp-ty-handed \u2013 a travesty\n\u2013 while legendary director\nAgn\u00e8s Varda also lost out\nfor Best Documentary.\nThe issue here isn\u2019t so\nmuch that Gerwig or\nVarda deserved to win in\ntheir categories, but rather,\nthe eventual winners were\nso predictable and safe,\nand \u2013 in a number of cases\n\u2013 weren\u2019t actually the best\nout of the nominees.\nAnd Kimmel can make\nas many jokes about\nHarvey Weinstein as he\nwants, as the Academy\npromises to change, but\nnothing can erase the\nfact the evening involved\nAcademy Awards being\ngiven to Kobe Bryant \u2013\naccused of sexual assault\nin 2003 \u2013 and Gary\nOldman \u2013 accused of\ndomestic violence.

It\u2019s a way they can\nuse their power within the\nstudios to push through\nmuch-needed changes.\nAnd it\u2019s this process, more\nthan any award ceremony,\nthat can create an industry\nin which women and\nminorities are able to tell\ntheir stories. This year,\ndespite the hype about\nGerwig, Rees, and others,\nonly six women won the\nAcademy Awards \u2013 the\nlowest number since\n2012.

We saw four players\noff to the penalty box at\ndifference was, the game\nwas hard fought and UCL\nwere fighting till the very\nend.\nIce Varsity is not only\nabout showing the brutality of ice hockey, but also\nthe gentleness of figure\nskating, as shown by our\nfigure skating ensemble\n\u201cAngels\u201d. Their performance during the first\nbreak between periods left\nspectators in awe, as they\nperformed Waltz jumps\nand Salchows through\nthe air. Proving that ice,\na substance harder than\nconcrete, can be used\nfor other things than just\nbashing UCL.\nThe 260 Imperial\nspectators attending the\nevent wanting \u201c\u2026bread\nand circuses\u201d were not\ndisappointed. With plenty\nof food and beer provided\nat the rink, everyone was\nin a good cheer. Which\nwould be proclaimed to\nUCL on several occasions\nthrough various chants.\nWith Imperial Immortals\n(american football) being\nat the forefront, with the\nmost ingenious and witty\nchirps.\nUsually players are\nmeant to ignore the\ncrowd, but it was made\nimpossible after two\nmegaphones were brought\nin by Imperial. Making it\npossible for the most out\nof tune, drunken, rendition\nof \u2018God Save the Queen\u2019\nin history.\nAfter the game finished,\neveryone either boarded\nthe rented double-deckers\nto the union, or went to\nthe after party at KOKO.\nImperial Devils celebrated the victory at the union,\nwith some overflowing\nwith joy to such extent,\nthey had to be taken home\nearly.\nNext year, Devils hope\nto defeat Yetis yet again.\nAnd hence will do their\nbest to practice often and\nnot disappoint when the\ntime comes.

Jie Rou, a fresher\nin Civil Engineering\ndecided to move on from\nChinese Kick-Boxing to\nregular old-school Boxing\nthis year and Dave, in his\n3rd year of Mechanical\nEngineering, joined IC\nBoxing last year, but they\nwere both fighting for the\nfirst time.\nOn Saturday 24th\nFebruary, Jie Rou and\nDavid were accompanied\nby our two Imperial\ncoaches, George Burton\nand TerenceAkinlade, and\nmade their way down for\nwhat was to be a tremendously smashing evening\nof boxing. The event was\na mass sell-out, with over\n300 people in the crowds\nand 10 fights overall. With\nsuch a huge turn-out and\natmosphere bursting with\nexcitement, the pressure\nwas on for IC Boxing to\nperform.\nFirst up was Jie Rou,\nour shining star from\nSingapore. On a regular\nday you\u2019ll find her smiling\nand generally being an\nall-round nice gal. An\n\u2018all-round nice gal\u2019, until\nit\u2019s time to be in the\nring that is! She told me\nafterwards she felt so bad\nfor punching the other\ngirl in the face, because\nthe Bristol Boxing Club\nhad been so nice! Well I\ntell you now, that\u2019s not\nwhat it looked like in\nthe ring. She maintained\nsome awesome slipping\nand rolling and her clean-cut style allowed her to\ncatch her opponent out\nevery opportunity she left\nherself open. In the end,\nthe judges came to an\nuncontested decision to\ncrown her victorious.\nDave was up 3rd and\nstarted out strong, keeping\nup his defence and\nthrowing well-timed jabs\nand hooks towards his\nopponent. He maintained\nhis ground for the first two\nrounds, but it was very\nclose. The final round was\na tie-breaker. Unfortunately, his opponent came\nback strong, managing\nto strike a shot, causing\nthe ref to step in and do a\nstanding count. Dave got\nhit by a flurry of punches\nin the last few seconds just\nas the whistle was blown.\nIt came to a split decision,\nbut unfortunately the\njudges gave the fight to\nhis opponent.\nIt was not all that bad\nfor Dave though, because\npre-fight he was already\nover the moon about the\nmatch. The \u2018match\u2019 being\nnot his own but the rugby\nScotland v England Six\nNations - with a 25-13\nfinal score, why would\nany Scotsman not be?\nAnyway, he took the\nloss on his chin, and\ncelebrated Scotland\u2019s win\nwith plenty of food and\nbevvies at the end of the\nnight.

Travel writer Exploring Hobbit was\nlucky enough to observe them in Sweden and has shared this unforgettable experience with Felix\nWhen sky is not the limit: nature\u2019s light show among the stars\nExploring Hobbit\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\nT\nhe enchanting\nAurora Borealis,\nor northern\nlights, frolic in\nthe sky when charged\nparticles from the sun\nbecome trapped in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field,\nemitting colourful lights\nof green, scarlet, crimson,\nand more. The lights unravel themselves usually\non dark clear nights. It\nis proposed that the best\ntimes to see them are near\nthe equinoxes in March\nand September, when\ngeomagnetic storms are\nlikely to occur more often.\nOne of the best spots to\nsee the Northern Lights is\nAbisko, Sweden. Abisko\nis an extremely small\nvillage and as of 2005,\nits population was only\n85 people! In addition, it\nis very remote and hence\nblessed with minimal light\npollution as the nearest\ntown, Kiruna, is located\napproximately 93km\naway. Abisko, and in\ngeneral northern Sweden,\nis consistently ranked as\none of the best and most\nreliable places to see the\nNorthern Lights.\nGetting to Abisko\nThe fastest way to get\nto Abisko from London\nis by catching a flight to\nKiruna. Carriers, such\nas Norwegian Airlines\nand SAS, offer this route\nbut they normally stop\nover at Stockholm for\nabout an hour. There is a\nshuttle service that goes\nto Abisko from the Kiruna\nairport and also from\nKiruna town. Depending\non the flight, this could\nbe the most economical\nway to get to Abisko. Alternatively, you can take\nthe overnight train from\nStockholm to the Abisko\ntrain station (Abisko\n\u00d6stra) via Kiruna, which\nlasts for about 17 hours.\nWhat to do in Abisko\nSince Abisko is a\nsmall village, there is\nreally nothing much\nto do throughout the\nday. Most activities are\ndone outdoors, such as\nhiking, cross-country\nskiing, dogsledding, and\nsnow mobiling, although\nthese are usually quite\nexpensive (of course, it is\nScandinavia!). At night,\nyou can join the Northern\nLights tour, though generally the Lights are visible\nfrom any location in the\nvillage. Most people walk\nto the Abisko National\nPark, where the sky is\npitch black at night and\nthus perfect for aurora\nviewing.\nAn alternative to\nspending your entire trip\nin Abisko is staying in\nKiruna for a couple of\nnights, which is also a\nrenowned destination\nto see the colourful\nlightshow. It is also in\nthe vicinity of more\nattractions, such as the\nKiruna Church and\nthe ICEHOTEL. The\nICEHOTEL in the village\nof Jukkasj\u00e4rvi near\nKiruna is the world\u2019s first\nice hotel and is rebuilt\ninto a different guise each\nyear with only ice and\nsnow. Apart from being a\nhotel, it houses an ice art\nhall featuring a collection\nof suites, ice rooms,\nceremony halls, chande-liers, and galleries. It also\ncontains an ice bar that\nserves drinks in glasses\nmade of ice. Although\nit could be costly to stay\nthere, you could still enjoy\nthis amazing attraction by\njoining guided tours such\nas the ICEHOTEL 365,\nwhich costs 200 Swedish\nkronas for students.\nThe unpredictable\nWinter in Sweden can\nbe unpredictable, especially in the northern part\nof the country. Raging\nsnowstorms mean unclear\nskies and therefore\ncurtailed luck of seeing\nthe Lights. Furthermore,\ntrains and flights may\nbe cancelled or delayed\nfor up to several days in\nsuch wretched weather.\nFinally, just like London\u2019s\nweather, the Northern\nLights themselves are very\nunpredictable. Therefore,\nuse a Sky Guide app to\nfind out the dark hours and\nthe local weather of your\nlocation. Since dark sky\nis pivotal, some say that\nmoonless nights would be\nthe best.\n\u201dAbisko is\nvery remote\nand hence\nblessed with\nminimal light\npollution\u201c\n\n"

Not I.\nS\namuel Beckett\u2019s\nNot I is notoriously\ndifficult to per-form. It is a short,\ncontinuous stream of\nwords from the character\nMouth that loops in and\nout of coherence, jumping\nbetween sentences, interspersed with repetition\nand interjections.\nIn 1972, American\nactress Jessica Tandy performed it in a New York\npremiere. She was told by\nBeckett backstage that she\nhad \u2018ruined his play\u2019 \u2013 24\nminutes was far too long.\nBeckett then decided to\ndirect it himself, handpicking Billie Whitelaw\nto play the role. Whitelaw\nperformed it in 14 and a\nhalf minutes. Later, Irish\nactress Lisa Dwan would\nbecome the \u2018ultimate motormouth\u2019, with a record\nnine and a half minutes in\nher shortest attempt.\nBeckett wanted the\nplay to be performed \u2018at\nthe speed of thought\u2019, and\nthere was no such thing as\ngoing too fast, as long as\nall the words were artic-ulated. But that is not the\nonly difficulty. The script\nis difficult to learn due\nto the lack of a coherent\ntrain of thought \u2013 that is\nthe point, as it is meant to\nmimic how a mind thinks.\nOn top of that, there\nare the very specific stage\ndirections \u2013 the performer\nhas to be suspended off\nthe ground in the middle\nof the stage, and only her\nmouth is to be illumi-nated, hovering exactly\neight feet off the ground.\nAll other parts of her, and\nthe stage, has to be pitch\nblack. She is buckled into\nplace, unable to move\nor see, condemned to\nspeak as fast as her mouth\nwould allow. Lisa Dwan\ndescribes the experience\nas \u2018terrifying\u2019, and \u2018every\nperformance is knife-edge\nstuff\u2019.\nOn the background\nof such a demanding\nperformance, it is incredibly impressive that Jess\nThom, who suffers from\nTourette\u2019s syndrome,\ndecided to take it on.\nTourette\u2019s is a condition\nwhich causes one to tic,\nwhich means making\nmovements or saying\nthings that once cannot\ncontrol. For Jess, her most\ncommon tics are saying\n\u2018biscuit\u2019 and thumping\nher chest with her fist. For\na play that requires one\nto be still and deliver a\nspeech with precision as\nquickly as possible, Not\nI seemed, on the outset,\nalmost impossible for\nsomeone with Tourette\u2019s\nto perform.\nDespite these difficul-ties, Jess performs the\nrole brilliantly (in twelve\nminutes as well!), in this\nunique production at\nBattersea Arts Centre that\nreveals Not I in a whole\nnew light and explores\nideas of reclaiming theatre\u2019s voice. In a video\nshown after her performance that charts the\ndevelopment of the play,\nwe see all the innovations\nthat went into these short\ntwelve minutes, to make\nit suitable for her and to\nbring out what she intends.\nFor example, because\nit is dangerous for her to\nbe strapped into place, a\nspecial wheelchair was\nbuilt for her on a platform\nthat lifts her eight feet off\nthe ground. Because she\nneeds to move, instead of\nstrapping her mouth into\nplace, she wears a dark\nhood that has a built in\nlight inside that shines on\nher mouth.\nJess says that she sees\nherself as \u201cdisabled\u201d, and\ngiven the nature of Not\nI\u2019s text, it seems almost\nnatural that it should be\nperformed by a neurodi-verse population. Rigid\nstage directions and\ninstructions from Beckett\naside, Jess\u2019 modified production is important \u2013 it\nis an act of reclaiming\ntheatre\u2019s voice for the\nrepresentation of all,\nincluding those who have\nlimitations that appear to\nbe at odds with artistic\ndirection, but which,\nas exemplified in this\ncase, actually bring new\nmeaning to a classic text.\nThroughout the perfor-mance, Jess tics freely,\nsometimes saying \u2018biscuit\u2019\nso rapidly and in succession that it fits seamlessly\ninto the pace of the text.\nThere is a tension when\nthat happens, the question\nhanging in the air: will she\nbe able to continue? When\nJess first came across\nthe play, she felt that it\nresonated with her \u2013 the\nisolation of Mouth that is\nevident between her bursts\nof speech, the alienation\nand the apparent chaos of\nher thoughts. She identified with Mouth, which\nseemed to parallel the\nthoughts running through\nher own mind at a time\nwhen her tics were getting\nworse. This performance\nis thus both personal and\npolitical \u2013 an externalisa-tion of her experiences,\nand a political act of\nreclaiming theatre\u2019s voice\nfor the marginalised.\nBattersea Arts Centre\nis the perfect location: an\nold converted town hall,\nit has an array of rooms\nof different sizes. Not I\nuses one of their smaller\nrooms, and the audience\nsit (and are encouraged\nto lie) on cushions on\nthe floor. It is a relaxed\nperformance, and BSL\nintegrated, a feature that\nJess felt strongly about.\nCharmaine, her BSL\ninterpreter, is illuminated\nnext to Jess during the\nperformance, and signs\neverything she says \u2013 including the tics!\nThe production video\nand post-show discussion\nmake the experience\ncomplete, and I felt that\nI left with a fuller understanding of the play, of\nJess\u2019 motivations, and the\nadvocacy that is integrated into the production.\nIt was a fascinating take\non what is traditionally a\nrigid, inflexible and tight-ly-controlled play \u2013 and\nits legacy is all the better\nfor it.\nTourettes hero Jess Thom gives Beckett\u2019s notoriously difficult motormouth in Not I a personal and political spin.\nJess Thom as Mouth and Charmaine, her BSL interpreter // James Lyndsay\nARTS\nJingjie Cheng\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Theresa May has made a\ncommitment to withdrawing from the single market, but what does this mean for Ireland?\nPOLITICS\nDivyen\nVanniasegaram\nPolitics Writer\nH\now do you\nsolve a problem like the\nIrish border?\nThis appears to be the\nbiggest stumbling block\nin achieving a successful\noutcome for Brexit. It\nseems an impossible\nsquare to circle. Theresa\nMay has committed to\nwithdrawing from the\ncustoms union and single\nmarket, which would\nmean there would need to\nbe border checks between\nNorthern Ireland and the\nRepublic of Ireland - this\nbeing the only land border\nthe UK shares with the\nEU - whilst also insisting\nthat one of her primary\ngoals is to avoid a hard\nborder within Ireland.\nShe hopes to do this in\none of two ways. The first\noption would be to set up\na customs partnership,\nwhich would mean the\nUK voluntarily mimics\nEU regulations for goods,\ndoing away entirely with\nthe need for a border.\nFor this to work, the UK\nwould need to maintain a\nlot of the same regulations\nit currently follows due to\nEU membership, which\ncould be achieved through\ndifferingregulatorybodies\nand mechanisms. It would\nmean the UK would no\nlonger be legally bound\nby the European Court of\nJustice but would need to\ntake note and act on some\nof its rulings to ensure\nthe UK\u2019s regulations are\nrunning as closely parallel\nwith the EU as possible.\nThis would also allow the\nUK to strike trade deals\nwith other countries by\navoiding membership of a\ncustoms union.\nup following the same\nrules as before, even if on\na voluntary basis instead.\nIf the UK deviates from\nagreed standards, then\none would assume that\nborder posts would need\nto be erected to protect\nthe EU\u2019s internal market\nfrom goods that don\u2019t\nmeet its standards. This\noption therefore appears\nincompatible with the\nUK\u2019s ability to use its\npost-Brexit autonomy to\nmake meaningful decisions regarding standards.\nThe second option\nTheresa May put forward\nin her speech was a\ncustoms arrangement\nwhereby a smart border\nutilising technology could\nbe erected. This option\nwould give the UK more\nflexibility to deviate away\nfrom the EU\u2019s regulations\nand would mean that when\nvehicles carrying goods\nwould ordinarily have to\nstop for customs checks,\nthey would be able to\ncarry on driving without\nthe need to stop. This\noption is arguably open to\nabuse, as both sides would\nneed to trust that what was\nbeing declared was what\nwas actually crossing the\nborder, with no physical\nway of checking these\ngoods. A trusted traders\nscheme would alleviate\nsome concerns but this\nsystem could still be open\nto abuse. This leaves\nmany commentators and\nthe EU skeptical that this\nkind of system could work\neffectively.\nGiven that the options\nproposed by the UK\ngovernment have obstacles that could be insur-the Conservatives have\nenough votes to govern\na majority in parliament.\nThe DUP, being a unionist\nparty in Northern Ireland,\nis completely opposed\nto any option that would\nseparate Northern Ireland\nfrom the UK economi-cally, as this would be an\neffective annexation of\nNorthern Ireland by the\nEU in their eyes. It therefore appears impossible\nto solve the problem of\nthe Irish border given the\nself-imposed red lines\nof both the EU and of\nTheresa May.\nThis has massive ramifications for the Good\nFriday agreement, which\nbrought an end to the\ntroubles and is sponsored\nby both the UK and Irish\ngovernments. It ensured\nan open border where\ncommunities, people,\nand goods could freely\ncross from one side to the\nother: now, this border\nis almost invisible. The\ncurrent freedoms and\npeace were- hard fought\nfor on all sides and to risk\nthis for Brexit appears\nlike an absurdity, especially when it is already\nunder pressure due to\nthe inability of Northern\nIreland parties to form an\nexecutive for the regional\nassembly. Theresa May\nhas conceded that when\nthe UK leaves the EU,\nthe UK and the EU will\nstill have to stay closely\naligned. Brexit will\nallow for bilateral trade\nagreements, however,\nthese will come with\npressures on standards\nand visa schemes. Brexit\nwill garner minimal gains\nat best, and could be the\ncatalyst for constitutional\ncrisis in Northern Ireland.\nBrexit could be like walking over a cliff edge for Ireland // Flickr/Guiseppe Milo\nmountable, it\u2019s important\nto consider the fail-safe\noption put forward by\nthe EU in the event of no\ndeal being reached. The\nfail-safe option proffered\nby the EU would be\nfor Northern Ireland to\neffectively remain in the\ncustoms union even if the\nrest of the UK doesn\u2019t.\nThis would effectively\npush the border back to\nthe Irish sea between the\nisland of Ireland and the\nrest of the UK. This option\nhas been vehemently\nopposed by the UK\ngovernment as a threat to\nthe integrity of the UK\u2019s\ndomestic economy, as\ncustoms checks would\nneed to be enforced\nbetween Northern Ireland\nand the rest of the UK.\nThe DUP\u2019s involvement is\nsignificant as they ensure\n\u201cIs leaving the\nEU worth it if\nthe UK ends up\nfollowing the\nsame rules as\nbefore, even\non a vountary\nbasis\u201d\nHowever, it does beg\nthe question of whether\nleaving the EU to gain\npower and sovereignty\nfor parliament is worth it\nif the UK ultimately ends\n\n"

The courier\nsends a signal that unlocks\nthe door, puts the package\ninside and sends another\nsignal to lock the door.\nThe server then notifies\nyou about the delivery and\nsets up a bank account\nwith a fake ID, waits for\nthe day when you are\nout and Amazon has a\nlot of deliveries, gains\naccess into your house\nand steals your valuables?\nThis might sound far-fetched but there have\nbeen instances in the past\nwhere people went the\nextra mile to successfully\nsteal something. Needless\nto say, many people are\nhesitant about using this\nservice.\nSince then, Amazon\nstarted looking into ways\nto ensure the safety and\nprivacy of its customers\nusing the Amazon Key,\nalong with ways to\nimprove the smartlock\nitself. One way is by\nbuying Ring, which\nowned the smart doorbell\ntechnology. The doorbell\ntakes a live video of\ncustomers\u2019 doorsteps and\nsends the videos to their\nsmartphones. Amazon\nhopes that this will help\ncustomers trust their new\nservice by ensuring the\nsafety and security of their\nhomes.\nBaird Equity Research\nanalyst Colin Sebastian\nsaid: \u201cAs Amazon moves\nare watching a live video\nof the delivery instead of\none sent after the delivery\nis over.\nThe downside of this\nis that the doorbell only\nsends a video of people\u2019s\ndoorsteps, and not the\ninside of the house. While\nthis ensures that the occupants have privacy within\ntheir house should the\nsystem be hacked, it also\nmeans that the customers\nwon\u2019t know much about\nwhat is going on just\ninside their house during\nthe time that their door\nis opened by the delivery\nperson. All they would\nknow is the duration of\nthe delivery.\nAlso, in terms of\nensuring security in\nhomes, the doorbell isn\u2019t\nreally useful for house\nowners with pets. In the\ncase of pets escaping, the\ndoorbell can\u2019t take preventive action against this\nevent \u2013 it would simply\nrecord it and inform the\nowner about the event.\nRing\u2019s\u2018smart\u2019doorbell // Creative Commons\nTECH\nKrithika Balaji\nTech Writer\n\u201cThe company\nhas a long\nway to go in\naddressing the\nconcerns of its\ncustomers\u201d\nAmazon recently acquired a small firm called Ring in the hopes of raising people\u2019s trust in the Amazon Key service.\n\u201cThe doorbell\ntakes a live\nvideo of the\ncustomers\u2019\ndoorsteps\u2026\u201d\nsends you the recorded\nvideo.\nUnderstandably, there\nwere many concerns\nraised about this service.\nFor starters, what would\nhappen if you have pets\nthat were able to run away\nwhen the delivery person\nopens the door? What\nabout planned thievery,\nwhere the delivery person\nmore aggressively into the\ngrocery delivery space ...\nwe believe smart security\ndevices will be an important factor in driving\nuser adoption.\u201d When\nsmart doorbells are im-plemented, one advantage\ncould be that customers\ncan take action against\nthe delivery person if the\nduration of the delivery is\nsuspiciously long, as they\nAcquiring Ring is a step\nin the right direction for\nAmazon but the company\nstill has a long way to go\nin addressing the various\nconcerns of its customers\nin an effective manner.\nThe company will have\nto provide evidence that\nthe Amazon Key won\u2019t\nbe a tool for malicious\nopportunists or planned\nthievery before more customers can start trusting\nand using this service.\nApplications of blockchain technology\nTECH\nHubert Kaluzny\nTech Writer\nX\nbut on the\nblockchain\u201d,\nhas become\nas much of a\ntechnological mantra as\n\u201cUber but for X\u201d in these\nrecent months. Apart\nfrom the sharp peaks and\nshallow troughs of the\nprice of cryptocurrencies\nproduced by a mutual\nbelief of value, is there\nany practical use of block-chain technology?\nSmart contracts are\nbeing used in blockchains\nto allow the execution\nof programs, and these\nprograms run on all participating nodes of a block-chain network. Of course,\nimplementations of these\nsmart contracts differ as\ndifferent cryptocurrencies\nhave different purposes.\nEthereum is well known\nfor using an almost Turing\ncomplete language, only\nlimited by an individual\u2019s\nbalance. This wildly free\nplatform has allowed the\ndevelopment of several\napplications, ranging\nfrom virtual gambling\ncasinos, crowdfunding\nplatforms and digital\nrights management to\nsomething as superfluous\nintact to increase security\nand privacy. The one\nlimitation of this technology is the low-bandwidth\nconnections being used\nnetwork as traffic from\nthe game made up 15% of\ntransactions at peak times.\nShould you be worried\nabout virtual cats? CryptoKitties has shown us\nthere are problems with\nthe current networks in\nplace; perhaps it wasn\u2019t\nthe killer application\nwe wanted, but one we\nneeded. Current \u2018crypto-giants\u2019 need to invest\nmore in infrastructure\nto ensure people who\nare getting introduced to\nthese new ecosystems\nhave the means to do so.\nApart from the Ethereum\nnetwork, there are several\nother interesting projects\nin the world of block-chains. Storj uses block-chains to connect people\nwho want to rent out drive\nspace to people who are\nwilling to lease it, using\nend-to-end encryption to\nfacilitate this. They use\na blockchain to keep a\ntrack of file permissions\nand which chunks of\nfiles are where, as they\nare never stored fully\nthe technology allows\na distributed ledger to\nexist containing all your\nhealth information shared\nbetween doctors, hospitals and clinics ensuring\nno loss of information\nas you change health\nproviders. This is a huge\nchange from the system\npreviously in place, where\npatients would have to\nremember things like all\nthe different medicine\nthey have been prescribed\nor present hand-written\nnotes on scrunched up\npieces of paper. MedCoins\nwould then be able to be\nused as payment between\npatients and doctors, for\nservices such as video call\nconsultations where the\nconsulting doctor is able\nto see all your medical\nhistory, or allow you to\nsell your health data to\nresearch companies in\nreturn for MedCoins.\nBlockchains have\nseveral utilities; they\nallow us to operate\nwithout supervision from\ngovernments or author-ities, they can be used to\nensure a single correct\naccount of events is kept\nbetween all parties, and\ncan execute pre-defined\nactions under immutable\nterms. The place which\nwe are at with blockchain\ntechnology is one that\nresembles the days of the\nearly internet, with technological pioneers already\nworking on \u2018Web 3.0\u2019.\nThere are many challenges that we are to overcome\nbefore we can utilise this\ntechnology in a meaningful way. Currently there\nare a lot of projects out\nthere that are using the\ncurrent popularity trend\nin blockchain technology\nrather than attempting to\nmake anything of value.\nAt the moment you\u2019re\nunlikely to be use any\nblockchains, however\nwith the development of\nnew applications they\nmay become much more\nwidespread.\nWhy you should be wary of tech\u2019s latest buzzword.\nBlockchains have seemingly been discussed everywhere, but is our attention justified?// Creative Commons\n\u201c\u2018X but on the\nblockchain\u2019\nhas become\nsomething of a\ntechnological\nmantra\u201d\n\u201cEthereum is\nwell-known\nfor using an\nalmost Turing\ncomplete\nlanguage\u201d\nas CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties allows you to\nspend some Ethereum in\nexchange for virtual cats,\neach of which is unique\nand able to be bred and\ntraded. The popularity of\nthis game in December of\nlast year managed to slow\ndown the entire Ethereum\nfor peer-to-peer connec-tions, as maintaining and\nbuilding infrastructure for\na large scale distributed\nsystem like this would\nprove extremely difficult.\nDuring the last Imperial\nBlockchain Forum hosted\nby the Imperial Centre of\n\u0421ryptocurrency Research\nand Engineering, Sinan\nBelhawi from MedCoin\npresented his use of\na blockchain in the\nmedical industry.

With teams flying\nin from other countries, the two day affair was thoroughly enjoyed by all.\nSPORTS\nAidan Bell\nGutierrez\nICSC Social Secretary\nO\nn the 17th-18th\nof February,\nI m p e r i a l\nCollege Sailing\nClub hosted the Imperial\nIcicle, now in its second\nyear. Spread across\ntwo days and hosted at\nWembley Sailing Club\non Welsh Harp Reservoir,\nthe event boasted 135\nraces, two massive socials\nand fantastic catering by\nImperial\u2019s French and\nSwiss chefs. The Icicle\nhad a total of 18 teams and\neven gained international\nrecognition with teams\nflying in from outside the\nUK.\nThe weekend started\non Friday night: after\nthe teams had met with\ntheir hosts, they headed\nto Wetherspoons to begin\npre-drinking for the house\nparty boldly hosted by\none of Imperial\u2019s Social\nSecretaries. The over 100-person strong party proved\na resounding success,\nwith teams thoroughly\nenjoying themselves and\nstaying until the early\nhours.\nSadly, for the Imperial\nsailors there was little\nchance to sleep with most\nhaving to get up at 5:30\nAM to start preparations\nfor the day ahead. The first\ncapsize of the day came\nearly with our Bosun,\nJames McLeod, taking\na refreshing dip next to\nthe pontoon before sails\nhad even been hoisted.\nDespite this, and with\n\u201cThe curry\ncame to an\nabrupt end\nwhen an\nelectrical\nfire resulted\nin a rapid\nevacuation\u201d\nremarkable efficiency for\nsleep deprived students,\nall the boats were rigged,\nready and out on the water\nas the first teams trickled\nin. All this hard work was\nrewarded with a bacon\nbutty, but sadly no sign of\nwind.\nAfter the briefing delivered by our Race Officer\nand former Commodore,\nJoe Burgin, the teams\nsat down for what they\nthought was going to\nbe long wait. However,\nbarely an hour afterwards,\nJoe decided it was time to\nlaunch and that the wind\nwas coming in. Despite\naccusations that he was\nbeing a fool by the rest\nof the race committee, we\nwent ahead as planned.\nSure enough, as the first\nboat launched off the\npontoon, a fair breeze was\nbeginning to make its way\nacross the reservoir.\nOnce the teams were\non the water, the start\nboat jumped straight into\nsequence with almost\ncontinuous rolling starts.\nNo mercy was given to\nany team that had fallen\nasleep and did not turn\nup to their boats, a move\njokingly commented\non by Bruce, one of our\numpires, as \u201cbrutal\u201d.\nMercy was not shown by\nthe umpires either who\ndoled out spins to anyone\nbreaking rule 42 in the\nlight winds. Unfortunately, the day was not without\nits challenges, with the\nwind coming and going\nand regular 90\u02da shifts.\nOverall, after a long day\nof racing, an astounding\n60 races were completed\nwith Edinburgh Blue and\nOxford Blue coming out\non top but with many\nraces left to sail.\nOnce everyone was\nwarm and dry, they\nheaded back to their hosts\u2019\nto prepare for the night\nahead. With everyone in\ntheir Disney costumes,\nthe sailors ventured to\nDrummond Street for a\ntraditional BYOB curry.\nWith over 100 in a private\nroom, the social got off\nto a fantastic start even\nif many freshers were\nleft without cutlery.\nUnfortunately, the curry\ncame to an abrupt end\nwhen an electrical fire on\nthe top floor resulted in\na rapid evacuation and\nfire engines called to the\nscene. We arrived earlier\nthan planned at the club,\nbut the night eventually\npicked up and many a\ndrunk sailor showed off\ntheir enthusiastic moves\non the dance floor.\nMuch to the dismay of\nImperial\u2019s freshers it was\nanother early start, once\nagain getting up at 5:30\nAM to rig and launch\nall the boats. Despite\neveryone being hungover,\ndue to the leadership of\nour Event Organiser and\nCommodore, Krystal\nLaw, the boats were again\nprepared for the arrival of\nthe teams.\nAfter only a short post-ponement, the wind filled\nin and racing commenced.\nThe first and only boat\nbreakage of the weekend\nhappened early in the day\nas one of the shackles\ncame undone on the jib.\nThankfully this happened\nwhilst still in the start\nsequence and the boat\nwas fixed by our fantastic\numpires in minutes. The\nwind, although more consistent than on Saturday,\nstill proved shifty as\nexpected on the Harp.\nThis did not stop the race\ncommittee squeezing in\nanother 30 races, giving\nevery team 10 races\neach before moving into\nleagues.\nThe teams were split\ninto Gold, Silver and\nBronze based on their\nround robin performance.\nThis saw some excellent\nteam racing with some\nvery evenly matched\nteams fighting it out. Our\nrace officer made the call\nto power through all 45\nraces before the end of the\nday. Sadly, due to lack of\ntime, we were not able to\ngo into finals. Fortunately,\nthere was still a clear\nwinner at the end of the\nday. with N.W.A (New\nWessex Alumni, basically Southampton Uni\u2019s\nalumni team). going undefeated in Gold league.\nThe day came to an\nend with the winning\nteams and umpires being\nrewarded with a healthy\nquantity of alcohol and\nN.W.A., the winners,\na \u201cbeautiful\u201d laser cut\ntrophy crafted in the\nImperial workshops. After\na long weekend, everyone\nwent home with smiles on\ntheir faces for a well-de-served night\u2019s sleep.\nOverall, the event ran\nsmoothly with N.W.A\ncoming in first place in\nGold, Edinburgh Blue in\nsecond and Oxford Blue\nin third and a total of\n135 races sailed, in very\nchallenging conditions.\nSpecial thanks must be\ngiven to all the umpires\n(Ed Fryer, Bruce Hebbert,\nRuth Owen, Bill Wyatt,\nPaul Robson, Andrew\nWishart, Tim Palmer,\nEnrica Mameli) who gave\nup their weekend for the\nevent. Also, all of the\nteam at Imperial, especially Joe Burgin (Race\nOfficer), Krystal Law\n(Event Organiser) and\nJames McLeod (Bosun)\nwho helped ensure the\nweekend went off without\na hitch.\nA chaotic mark 4 rounding. // Calvin Chan\nJenny and Lauren of Oxford\u201cstrike their pose\u201dfor the photographer. . // Calvin Chan\nGold and Silver for London\u2019s finest\nSPORTS\nAymeric Regnier\nICXCAC member\nL\nast Wednesday,\nImperial took\non the last\nLUCA (London\nUniversities and Colleges\nAthletics) race of the\ncross-country season,\nfielding over 30 runners\nand finishing top of the\nleague for the women and\nin 2nd place for the men.\nAs per usual, the club\nmet at Beit in the early\nafternoon for the traditional face paint and chit\nchat before taking the\ntube, this time in direction of Shepherd\u2019s Bush\nas the race was soon to\ntake place in Wormwood\nScrubs. This was a vital\nrace as the runners faced\nthe challenge of keeping\ntheir places on the team\npodiums, as the women\u2019s\nA team were in 1st\nposition and had a mere\n6 points lead on UCL,\nwhereas the men\u2019s A team\nwere in 2nd position and\nonly 15 points behind\nUCL, so the rivalry gave\nthese feisty runners all the\nnecessary motivation on\ntheir way to the park.\nThe course began\nnear the Linford Christie\nathletics track where the\nclub usually trains with\nThames Valley Harriers,\nthen entered a wooded\nsection. Once out of the\nwoods, runners were to\nproceed around the park,\nmostly on soft ground or\nmud in our case as the\nweather hadn\u2019t been kind\nthe day before, and on\na relatively flat course\noverall, before arriving to\nthe finish line.\nAfter taking a club\npicture, the race was\nabout to start and the\n15- women- and 16-men-strong Imperial team made\nits way to the starting line,\ndetermined to finish the\nseason on a bright note.\nAs the women ran 2 laps\nand the men 3 laps, each\nlap 3km long, it gave the\nnon-competing squad a\nchance to cheer on their\nteam-mates and encourage them throughout the\nrace, and by the looks of\nit, it was not in vain.\nOverall the whole club\ndid a great performance\nwith some impressive\nrunning, as all 5 of Imperial\u2019s A team made it\nin the top 25, led home\nby Oliver Newton in 4th,\nKirill Mikhaylov in 15th,\nFergus Johnson in 19th,\nThomas Bayley in 21st\nand Charlie McFadzean in\n25th, followed closely by\nMatt Douthwaite in 26th.\nThe women\u2019s race was\nalso full of smashing per-formances, as the Imperial\nA team dominated the last\nrace of the season: with\nnotably Georgia Curry\ncoming in 2nd place, Kate\nOlding in 3rd, Women\u2019s\nCaptain Anna Lawson\nin 4th, Sarah Grover in\n6th, Anna Wilson in 17th\nand Club Captain Alex\nMundell in 21st, a total\nsuccess.\nAfter celebrating\nthose victories with more\npictures, a top notch\nbaking degustation and\nmany congratulations,\nit was time for more\ncelebrations as the end\nof the cross-country\nseason meant that the\nleague results were to be\nannounced.\nThe team then made\nits way to the TVH club-house, where the results\nwere to be sorted and the\nwinners declared. This\nwas the moment we had\nbeen waiting and working\nfor since the first race at\nParliament Hill, and all\nthe hard work was finally\nabout to pay off: overall\nthe Women\u2019s Team won\nthe league, with amazing\nperformances throughout\nthe season by many of\ntheir finest athletes such\nas Sarah Johnson, Kate\nOlding, Sarah Grover,\nCaptain Alex Mundell,\nGeorgiaCurryandnaturally Women\u2019s Captain Anna\nLawson, who encouraged\nher team all along the\nseason and led them to\nvictory, with also some\nterrific individual results\nas Kate Olding ended 3rd\nof the women\u2019s overall\nstandings, Anna Lawson\nin 5th and Sarah Grover\nin 7th. Imperial women\u2019s\nB and C teams also did\ngreat as they made 5th\nand 8th place respectively.\nThe immense success was\nmade even sweeter as it\nwas the first time that the\nImperial women\u2019s team\nwon the league, what a\ndream team.\nOn the men\u2019s side, the\nresults were also absolutely amazing: the A team\nended in 2nd position with\na great lead over Brunel\nand just 71 points short of\n1st place. The season was\nfilled with equally strong\nperformances as Oliver\nNewton, Harry Scriven,\nHenry Hart, Fergus\nJohnson, Kirill Mikhaylov, Charlie McFadzean,\nChrisThomas, Chris Olley\nand Men\u2019s Captain Lewis\nJackson made the men\u2019s\nA Team shine all along\nthe season, with Oliver\nNewton finishing in 4th\nof the men overall and\nKirill Mikhaylov in 7th\noverall.

By Chloe\nThis week Food writer Bl\u00e1ith\u00edn Dockery investigates whether By Chloe, a new addition to the London vegan food\nscene, is a worthwhile brand or just cashing in on the \u201ctrendiness\u201d of veganism.\nFOOD\nBl\u00e1ith\u00edn Dockery\nFood Writer\nA\ncouple of years\nago merely calling a food vegan\nwould have\nmade many of us shudder,\npicturing something dry\nand tasteless. However,\nthere has clearly been a\nrevolution as veganism\nhas changed its image\nfrom oddball hippies to\nvibrant health-conscious\nmillennials. With the\nnumber of vegans in\nBritain rising by 360%\nover the last 10 years, it\nis no wonder vegan-based\nmenus have been popping\nup across the restaurant\nindustry. Cashing in on\nthis trend are a number\nof completely vegan fast\nfood eateries (mainly\nin east London) that\nhave recently appeared,\nFounded by Chloe Coscarelli in 2015, the first\nby CHLOE opened on\nBleeker Street in NYC,\nserving vegan baked\ngoods, sandwiches and\nsalads. The first location\nwas a huge success,\nattracting trendy New\nYorkers who were eager\nto try the \u201cnext big thing.\u201d\nTen more locations\nopened across the US in\nthe following years, but\ninternational expansion\nwas the next goal for the\nbrand.Thanks to London\u2019s\nvibrant food scene and the\nsuccess of other NYCbased brands such as\nDominique Ansel, it was\nchosen as by CHLOE\u2019s\nfirst international\nlocation, where it opened\nin early February 2018. I\nwas particularly excited\nabout this opening, having\nadmittedly already tried\nby CHLOE in New York\nwhere I was completely\nblown away by the food.\nHowever, I wondered if\nit would maintain this\nquality so far away from\nits original location.\nFirst Impressions\nArriving at by\nCHLOE\u2019s Covent Garden\n\u201cA neon pink\nsign said\u2018Guac\nSave The\nQueen\u2019\u201d\neatery on a warm Saturday\nafternoon, I was initially\nsurprised by how large the\nsite was, particularly as\nthe New York location is\nrather small. Clearly there\nwere high expectations\nfor its first international\nlocation. Opening the\ndoor I was amazed to see\na huge queue snaking\naround the tables leading\nup to the ordering counter.\nI knew it was still in its\nearly days (it had only\nopened a week earlier)\nbut I really did not expect\nthis many people! Luckily\nthe queue moved quickly,\nand I passed the time by\nadmiring the d\u00e9cor and\nexamining the menu. The\nrestaurant had a very light\nand airy feeling, thanks\nto the large windows and\nwhite painted brick walls,\nfeaturing wooden shelves\nupon which mini cacti\nwere placed (oh how mil-lennial!). On one wall was\na neon pink sign saying\n\u201cGuac Save The Queen\u201d\nwhich was probably some\ninterior designer\u2019s attempt\nto make the location more\n\u201cLondon\u201d. Other quirky\nfeatures includes the egg\nshaped seat swings (also\nseen in the NY resaurant)\nand a merchandise stand\n(because obviously it\u2019s\nnot just about the foodit\u2019s about the brand).\nWhen I finally reached the\norder counter I picked a\nrange of food items to try\nin order to make a proper\njudgement.\nThe Food\nAfter making a rather\ngrand order: the classic\nburger, pesto meatball sub\nand sweet potato fries, I\nwaited patiently for my\nfood to be prepared. After\na relatively short wait,\nI hopped up quickly to\ncollect my order as the\nstaff shouted my name\nand settled down to begin\na food adventure. I first\nstarted with the classic\nburger, made with a\ntempeh-lentil-chia-walnut\npatty (try saying that in\na hurry). The patty itself\nwas relatively small\nand flat but overall the\nburger certainly had that\npicture-perfect look,\ncomplete with a slice\nof tomato, lettuce and a\ngolden bun. Taking my\nfirst bite, I must admit that\nI was rather unimpressed;\nthe patty was too stodgy\nand kept crumbling\napart. Other flavours of\nthe burger were better,\nespecially the signature beetroot ketchup;.\nHowever, I found the\npickles slightly overpowering and too sharp. Next\nup were the sweet potato\nfries. The fries were okay\nbut weren\u2019t anything\nspecial: not particularly\ncrispy and ,in my opinion,\nslightly too soft. The\none saving grace was\nby CHLOE\u2019s speciality\ncondiments including the\nbeetroot ketchup as well\nas its chipotle aioli. The\nketchup was sweet but not\noverpowering and the aioli\nhad a nice kick and a rich\nsmoky flavour. Finally, I\ntried the Pesto Meatball\nSub, which was what I\nreally had been looking\nforward to. Although a\nslightly clumsier food to\neat than a simple burger,\nI managed to take a\ngenerous bite, getting all\nthe different elements in\none go. The bread was a\nsweet soft pillow hugging\nthe perfectly round Portobello \u201cmeatballs\u201d, which\nwere settled on a tangy\ntomato marinara sauce.\nTopping the meatballs\nwas a nutty, rich basil\npesto and creamy cashew\n\u201cmozzarella.\u201d All together\nthe flavours mixed really\nwell, although it was\nrather filling due to the\ndense \u201cmeatballs.\u201d\nThe Beet Mine Burger// by CHLOE\nWorth the hype?\nHaving amassed a cult following thanks to the\n\u201ctrendy\u201d nature of veganism, by CHLOE\u2019s\nhype was huge, as demonstrated by the major\nqueue I endured. The brand really stepped\nup to the mark by choosing one of the most\npopular tourist destinations in London and\ncreating a picture-perfect establishment, from\nthe pink neon signs to quirky swing seats.\nHowever, with the competition for vegan\neateries heating up, it\u2019s not just about aes-thetics. Although the meatball sub was great,\nconsidering the price and quality of the rest of\nthe food items I\u2019m sad to say that by CHLOE\nwas not worth the hype.\nPrice\nBurger: \u00a39.00\nMeatball Sub: \u00a39.60\nFries: \u00a34.00\nBest part\nby CHLOE\u2019s speciality condiments (really\ninnovative flavours!)\nWorst part\nPrice/ Classic burger\nincluding Temple of\nSeitan and What the Pitta!\nThese joints not only\nattract vegans but also\npeople who are simply\ncurious about how tasty\nvegan food can be (not to\nmention getting a quality\ntrendy pic for insta). This\nmajor market is attracting\nmore established vegan\nchains and that is where\nby CHLOE steps in.\nOver in the US,\nveganism has also had\na major revolution, particularly in New York,\nbirthplace of by CHLOE.\n\n"

But that was\nall too long ago. Those\nfamiliar with His Dark\nMaterials might think of\nit as the atheist\u2019s take on\nNarnia. Those who aren\u2019t\nwill at least have heard\nof it since it is the book\nthat the feature film The\nGolden Compass is based\non.\nThe first instalment\nof his new series, The\nBook of Dust, is La Belle\nSauvage - in English,\n\u2018The Beautiful Savage\u2019.\nPullman returns to Lyra\u2019s\nworld, continuing to\nhighlight the shady side of\nreligion in what is a much\ndarker book.\nThe story carries us\non a journey where Lyra\n\u2013 the protagonist of His\nDark Materials \u2013 is still\na baby but somehow still\nvery much the same fierce\npersonality as she is in the\noriginal series. Pullman\ncontinues in his familiar\nfashion of having as the\nmain characters a young\nboy and girl. This time,\nit is Malcolm and Alice.\nThough they may be\nyoung, the world around\nthem isn\u2019t.\nHis Dark Materials\nis famous - notorious,\nperhaps - for its portrayal\nof the Magisterium, a\nglobal religious authority,\nas the main antagonists.\nIn La Belle Sauvage,\nPullman continues to\nexplore this. Notably, we\nlearn about \u2018The League\nof Saint Alexander\u2019,\na group designed to\nencourage children to\nreport heretic behaviour.\nPullman is adamant about\ngetting his very anti-re-ligious message across\nand is well-practiced at\nexploring the authoritative and negative side of\n\u201cPullman\nreturns to\nLyra\u2019s world,\nhighlighting\nthe shady side\nof religion in\na much darker\nbook\u201d\n\u201cGerard\nBonneville is\nan evil man,\nwho brings\na terrifying\ndarkness to\nthe book\u201d\norganised religion, which\nas we know is a heated\ntheme at present.\nFor example, it would\nbe na\u00efve to assume that\nmost children had no idea\nof the current situation\nregarding Islamic terror,\nor even that they never\nquestioned the existence\nof God. He does perhaps\ndo this a bit bluntly, and\nthe allegorical veil often\nwears thin. However, this\nappears to be his style.\nYou could be forgiven\nfor thinking that this\nwas a children\u2019s book,\nbut its content is fairly\nmature. Violence and\nunpleasantness are fairly\ncommonplace. In one\nscene, Pullman even\nalludes to the molestation\nof a child. Pullman should\nbe applauded for the way\nhe balances the mature\nand the fantastically\nwondrous, the latter of\nwhich makes his writing\nso irresistible. Reading\nLa Belle Sauvage felt\nvery much like a dream:\nnightmarish in parts,\nand absurdly glorious in\nothers. Yet despite that\nabsurdity, it is very easy\nto soak in. There are of\ncourse a few watery bits\nhere and there. There\nare also a lot of passages\nwhich are slightly drawn\nout, such as one describing in detail the way\nthe trio make their way\nthrough the flood, which\nwas slightly unnecessary.\nLa Belle Sauvage introduced some interesting\nnew characters as well\nas gave us a glimpse of\nthe history of some old\nones (Father Coram!).\nMalcolm, who works as\na potboy in his parents\u2019\ninn, is a likeable character from the start. He\nis curious without being\nnosy and has a strong\nmoral compass. He is\nvery down to earth and\ntakes it upon himself to be\nLyra\u2019s protector. Alice, his\ncompanion, is a pleasantly\nresilient young girl. Alice\nis the type of girl who\nseems to be older than\nher years and despite her\nferociousness, she has a\nunique personality and a\ngood heart, ending up as\na very lovable addition to\nthe characters we know\nand love. Then of course\nthere is the baby Lyra,\nwho has a personality\nof her own. If Malcolm\nand Alice were Claus\nand Violet Baudelaire\nfrom Lemony Snicket\u2019s\nA Series of Unfortunate\nEvents, then Lyra would\nbe Sunny - an innocent\nyet fierce baby who you\nwould have no trouble\nbelieving will become the\nLyra of the future.\nFinally, there is Gerard\nBonneville. This is an\nevil man who brings the\ndarkness to the book. He\nand his terrifying hyena\ndaemon make for a truly\nfrightening combination.\nThe parts where he makes\nan appearance were some\nof the most interesting and\nexciting in the book.\nDo not believe for a\nsecond that this book is a\nshadow of His Dark Materials. La Belle Sauvage\nis written just as well, and\ntold in the same gripping\nfashion. My only regret\nupon its publication is the\nwait until the next instalment of the Book of Dust.\nBut if you can\u2019t bear the\nthought of the wait till The\nSecret Commonwealth\nis released then fret not!\nHis Dark Materials is due\nto be made into a full-length BBC series later\nthis year. Here\u2019s to many\nmore years of Pullman\u2019s\nbeautiful fantasy.\nPhilip Pullman \u2013 master of the microcosm // BBC\nBOOKS\nWaleed El-Geresy\nBooks Writer\nDavid Fickling. 560 pp.\nLA BELLE SAUVAGE\nby Philip Pullman\nAre we living under the tyranny of science?\nMaybe we all need to take some time to re-evaluate our basic relationship with science.\nI\n\u2019ve noticed posters\naround college,\nand have been\nleafleted with a\nmanifesto. At first, I was a\nlittle taken aback by their\nstance: \u2018We believe the\nscientific method is dogmatic and prescriptive,\nand it restricts creativity\nof thought in science.\u2019The\ngroup, calling themselves\nthe \u2018Against Method\nCollective\u2019, seems to have\nbased their campaign (or\nso-called revolution) on\nthe writings of the rather\nmaverick philosopher of\nscience Paul Feyerabend.\nInterested, I thought I\u2019d\ntake a look.\nIn their materials they\nmention a text called\nAgainst Method from\n1975 which I picked\nup from the library but,\nhonestly, found a little\ntoo dense for someone\nnot versed in reading\nphilosophy. However, I\ndid find another book by\nFeyerabend, based on a\nseries of public lectures\nhe gave in 1992 at the\nend of his life, called The\nTyranny of Science: it\u2019s\ntransformed the way I\nthink about science.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s time\nfor a big pull-quote. We love\nthese things,\nbut don\u2019t\nforget to make\nthem short!\u201d\nFeyerabend is more\nthan just a dry critical\nthinker, he is a masterful\nstoryteller. His voice is\nstrong and often makes\nthe reader (or this reader,\nat least) gasp, laugh, and\nscrew up their face in\ndispleasure. His provocative thoughts are most\nchallenging to those of\nus who have been fully\nindoctrinated with the\n\u2018scientific\u2019 view of the\nworld \u2014 many of us at\nImperial for sure!\nBut this is exactly what\nhe is trying to do: enrage\nus and wake us up from\nour complacency.\nFeyerabend wants us to\nrealise the fallacy in our\nown scientific thinking.\nHe wants us scientists\nto remember that we\nare humans and cannot\nremove ourselves (and\nall other influences) from\nscience. He wants us to\nrealisethatbyignoringthis\nwe are fooling ourselves,\nbut, more importantly, he\nargues that our blinkered\nway of thinking would\nlimit what we could learn.\nHe starts, like most\nphilosophers, with the\nAncient Greeks and\nthen charts the rise of\nrationalism through to our\nmodern world, in which\nthe mystical \u2018scientific\u2019\nworld view rules supreme.\nHe argues that some of the\nvery basic assumptions\nwe all make about science\nare false and that sustainable parts of scientific\nideology were created on\nthe basis of superficial\ngeneralisations. He argues\nthat this has led us all to\nabsurd misconceptions\nabout the nature of human\nlife.\nHe pleads for us to\nunderstand that knowledge is obtainable by\nany method, and by\nunderstanding this we\ncould relinquish science\u2019s\nhold over all truth, thus\ncoming out from under\nits tyranny and solve the\nreal problems people face:\nhunger, poverty, and war.\nTo Feyerabend, the\nsciences themselves are\nnot the enemy. They\nplay their part in the real\nsolutions. Feyerabend\nthought the problem\nlies in the scientific\nmethod: scientists are\ntaught to be \u2018objective\u2019,\napproaching the world as\nan abstraction instead of\nexperiencing the world\nby other methods. Science\nencourages us to theorise\nand dehumanise people,\nturning us into data or\nobjects to model. This,\nfor Feyerabend, is the true\ntyranny of science.\nBut why should we\nread Feyerabend now?\nScience, now more than\never, seems to be under\nthreat and has started to\nfight back. We have seen\npresidents dismissing\nclimate change, politicians saying that we \u2018have\nhad enough of experts\u2019,\nand schools teaching cre-ationism.\nPeople have had\nenough of science and\nits absoluteness, its hard\ninhumanness, and its\n\u2018objectivity\u2019. In response,\nscience has entrenched\nitself. Instead of opening\nitself up to examination\nand accepting its flawed\nnature, the scientific\nestablishment poo-pooed\nnon-believers as stupid\nand ignorant.\nThis sentiment was\nmost evident in April\n2017, when those devoted\nto science attended the\nworldwide political march\nfor science with placards\nthat read slogans such as\n\u2018Science reveals reality\u2019,\n\u2018Science has no agenda\u2019 ,\nand \u2018Without science it\u2019s\njust fiction\u2019. Here, scientists were saying that the\nonly way to knowledge is\nthrough science: science\nis the only truth. Thanks to\nFeyerabend, I can see that\nnot only are these statements too naive about the\nnature of science, but also\nthat they are dogmatic and\noppressive. No wonder\nwe haven\u2019t convinced\nanyone to come join our\nevidence-based, peer-re-viewed, rational cult.\nMaybe scientists\nshould all read Feyerabend, learn to be a little\nless self-righteous, and\nopen their minds to new\nways of thinking. Instead\nof oppressing ourselves\nand others with science,\nwe should maybe take\nnote of what Feyerabend\nsaid all those years ago\nand replace the scientific\nmethod with the principle\nthat \u2018anything goes\u2019.\nFeyerabend asks us to challenge the orthodoxy of science // Wikimedia\nBOOKS\nHenry Bennie\nBooks Writer\nPolity Press. 180 pp.\nTHE TYRANNY OF SCIENCE\nby Paul Feyerabend\nIs it time to abandon our current model of scienctific understanding? // Wikimedia\n\n"

It is\nheartening to see that, in\nthese days of high fees,\nstudents don't view education merely as a service\ntransaction but as something worth expressing\ngratitude for. It certainly\nmakes the effort we put\ninto teaching feel very\nworthwhile.\u201d\nBurstow said \u201cit was a\npleasure to read through\nthe nominations and see\njust how much of a positive impact Imperial staff\nhave had on students.

In\nthe remaining two outlets\ncash will be accepted only\nat peak times, thus severely restricting our freedom\nof payment choice. With\nthis undemocratic deci-sion, the college shows\nthat is does not care about\nstudent/ staff opinion and\nconcerns on this issue.\u201d\nCollege initially ran\nthe trial for two weeks\nat the end of December,\nacross four outlets, before\nextending it to eight\noutlets for the next two\nmonths.

One\nuser of the hack-space, a\nfinal year student from the\nFaculty of Natural Sciences, told Felix: \u201cThis is\nvery disappointing news.\nWhile I think opening\nthe White City space for\nlonger is a good thing,\nthe fact remains that\nclosing the space will be\nvery inconvenient: many\npeople will go to the space\nto start printing, and then\nreturn several hours later\nwhen it\u2019s done. This won\u2019t\nbe possible if we\u2019ve got to\ntravel to White City.\u201d\n\u201cThe Hackspace is\nincredibly important for\na number of students,\nnot only those from the\nDesign Engineering\ncourse, but across different departments.

Get all the best news, culture and sports every week.\nGet the cat on the go!\nImperial beat Oxford at baseball (at least once)\nT\nhe Imperial\nBaseball and\nSoftball club\nplayed a league\ngame against Oxford a\nfew weekends ago. Many\nof the club\u2019s players were\nunavailable that weekend though, so Daniel\nKok borrowed a friend\nfrom his old university\u2019s\nbaseball team to fill in for\nthe game. Despite this legitimate substitution, the\nteam was still one player\nshort of a full team.\nThe game begun and\nOxford came out strong in\nthe top of the first inning,\nscoring five runs against\nImperial. Despite the\npressure put on the team,\nthe Imperial Falcons had\nfaith in themselves to level\nthe score, \u201cI hope Daniel\ngets struck out so I don\u2019t\nhave to bat next\u201d said\nJake Lee. Jake\u2019s optimism\ncarried him to first base,\nthus passing the pressure\nto Jonathan Cheung who\nwas making his first plate\nappearance since accidentally scoring a run for\nUCL. Discovering abili-flawless second inning to\ndeny Oxford from scoring\nany runs. Veteran Edo Lisi\nscored soon after to take\nthe lead for the Falcons.\nFrom Imperial\u2019s fielding,\nyou could barely tell that\nthey were a man down.\nSilky double plays were\nbeing made and bullets\nwere being thrown by\nKaptain Kok and Andrew\nCounsell to first baseman\nJoe Ronan. Hours of the\n\u2018training drill\u2019 pepper had\npaid off; everyone was\ngetting hits and runs to\nmaintain Imperial\u2019s lead.\nHowever, Oxford\npicked up 4 runs in their\nlast half inning. Imperial\u2019s\n3 run lead had become a\none run deficit. Though,\nJoe Coulson stole his way\nround the bases to score\na game saving run. Two\nouts, the last inning, and\nthe scores tied... Jonathan\nfound himself at the plate\nagain. With the fate of the\ngame (and a 100% regulation baseball bat) in his\nhands, he waited for the\nright pitch before making\na huge hit to centre field.\nDescribed by Edo as a\n\u201cmagnificent walkoff\u201d,\nthis clutch hit meant the\nImperial Falcons had\nstolenthewinfromOxford\nat the very last second!\nDespite his Valiant effort,\nJonathan failed to score\nany runs for himself this\ngame. He blames Joe\nRonan for getting struck\nout at crucial moments.\nJoe was forgiven when the\nteam found out his lung\ncollapsed mid game.\nUnfortunately the\nscore to the second game\nwas lost somewhere\non the trek home from\nHarlington and the writer\ncannot remember who\nwon. Joe Ronan also does\nnot remember the score,\nbut commented that \u201cthis\n(lung collapse) is bants,\nwe beat Oxford with one\nless player and one less\nlung\u201d.\nICURFC 2s STILL ON TOP\nS\no far this season,\nImperial 2nd XV\nhave been a force\nto reckon with,\ntheir latest game proving\nagain how strong this team\nhas been. It first started\nwith some fast paced\nback and forth rugby, both\nteams showing strong\nruns of play. Eventually,\nafter an intense 10 mins,\nImperial managed to open\nthe scoring. A strong run\nby Cowen, followed by\nseveral textbook phases,\nled to ICURFC\u2019s welshi-est welshman Ifan Dafydd\nslipping round the outside\nof the defence to score\nunder the posts. Fraser\nwith the conversion meant\nImperial were up 7-0.\nNot long after, pressure\nfrom the Imperial defence\ncaused their 10 (one of the\nbiggest/chunkiest fly halfs\never seen, it was very\nconfusing, was he a 10?)\nto slice a kick. The ball\nwent sideways, straight\ninto the hands of Imperial.\nIt ended with Dowkes\npulling off a naughty step\nand scoring a try whilst\npointing and smiling at\nthe guy he stepped. A bit\nharsh, considering both\nthe guy\u2019s ankles had just\nbeen broken. The kick\nwas no good- Fraser\nhad the accuracy, but\nnot the power. He will\nno longer skip leg day.\nUnfortunately, just before\nthe break, some strong\nrunning from Kings\u2019\nforwards (and some very\ndebatable tackle attempts\nfrom Imperial) meant the\nscore at the end of the first\nhalf finished 12-7. The\nopposition had their heads\nup and started the second\nhalf like they finished the\n1st half, with another try.\nFrankly, it was hard to\nkeep count of the number\nof missed tackles, with\nImperial players flying left\nright and centre. At 14-12\ndown, Imperial needed\nto do something. Temp\ncoach Elliot Quigley\nmade some power sub-stitutions, which caused\na well-needed increase\nin intensity. Quigley for\nfuture England manager?\nAfter some attacking pres-sure, great hands between\nGustave and Gianluigi\nlead to an Italian (Gian)\nscoring a try, which is\na rare sight these days,\nthose poor Italians. It did\nmake up for the awful\noffload attempt Gian had\nmade earlier. It was just\nawful. Why Gian, why?\nWith boosted confidence,\nand after some \u2018manly\u2019\nscreaming from captain\nWheaton after a boot\nto the face, Imperial\nscored again. This time\nit was off a scrum with\nno-longer-temp-coach\nQuigley going blind,\nKirrane, who proved he\nwas the fastest ginger of\nthe team (sorry Jack and\nElliot), by outpacing the\nwinger and full back to\nscore in the corner. It was\nscored with some well-de-served showboating, as\nthe match finished 29-14\nto Imperial, a BP win. A\nfew shoutouts: 1. Well\ndone to Rob for scrapping\nwith almost every opposition player 2. Rohit always\ncrying about people scoring on his wing and him\nnever getting a chance,\npoor baby 3. Doobie D\nkeeping the bench all nice\nand warm, it was needed\nfor the \u2018injuries\u2019 (looking\nat you Koide and Cowen).\nOverall a tough game, but\na great performance by\nthe boys.\nSPORTS\nJonathan Cheung\nIC Baseball player\nSPORTS\nSorrell Cowen\nICURFC 2nd\nXV player\nImperial Falcons on the defence at Harlington // IC Baseball\n29 14\nImperial\nRugby\n2nd\nTeam\nKings\nRugby\n2nd\nTeam\nV\n\u201cWith boosted\nconfidence,\nand after\nsome\u2018manly\u2019\nscreaming\nfrom Wheaton,\nImperial\nscored again\u201d\ndummying like he had\nnever dummied before,\nand scoring with some\nserious pace in the\ncorner.

The\nmain framework\nthat manages\nall the course\nmaterial and information\nfor most departments, and\nyet it still remains flawed.\nIt is currently the principal exchange platform\nbetween professors and\ntheir respective students\nwhen it comes to sharing\nnotes, tutorials, and all\nother diversified pieces\nof information, but does\nit achieve a clear and\nstructured organisation,\nand truly correspond to\nthe most efficient way to\ndo so?\nFrom the inconsistency\nof its usage between lec-turers, to the unnecessary\nrestrictions it poses to\nthe students, Blackboard\nhas led to a lot of unsatisfied opinions. Often, the\nnecessary material for a\ncourse is not solely available on Blackboard, and\nyet it is still not possible to\naccess other knowledgeable sources, or personal\nstudying elements,\nwithout having an excessive amount of tabs open,\nforcing us to jump back\nand forth through our\nopen pages to recall the\nmost basic of details. How\nis it that a website created\nfor students in order to\nimprove their access and\nunderstanding of course\ninformation, doesn\u2019t\nactually give us authority\non the outline of material,\nand provides only limited\nsources of exchange with\nof \u201cshared information\u201d\nthrough this interface\nshould be re-evaluated.\nInstead of having an open\nand constructive medium\nbetween professors and\nstudents, current Virtual\nLearning Environments\n(VLEs) such as Blackboard allow no space\nfor social studying. This\ncreates difficulty in immediate access to specific\ninformation or particular\nanswers, leading to yet\nanother open tab on our\nalready busy screen to\naccommodate for a social\nwebsite such as Facebook,\nWhatsapp or Google\nDrive, with which no\nclear systematic scheme\nhas been set up, making\nthis whole process all the\nmore confusing. There\nis a noticeable lack of\nengagement from the\nstudents and a clearly\nlimited interaction with\nthe teachers, which therefore means there is no true\nsense of co-dependency\nor community. We are\nessentially constrained to\nuse a single VLE which\nhas not been improved for\nover 10 years.\nThe work we are given\nis hard enough as it is; the\nway to access the necessary material shouldn\u2019t\nbe an additional source\nof stress and concern.\nInstead of having an\nunclear institution-pro-vided website, why not\nprovide the students with\nan intuitive system that\nallows them to organise\nmaterial in the way they\ndeem best for their work\nethics? We should be able\nto share organised pages\nof information with one\nanother and collaborate\nas a group. Improving the\nuser interface and simplifying the layout, giving\nit a more innate feel, and\ntherefore giving both lecturers and students more\nconfidence to interact\nwith others through this\nshared platform and take\npart in open discussions\nabout certain challenging\ntopics.

In ret-rospect, the mere concept\ncreated by a third year\nMechanical Engineering\nstudent, which aims to\nencompass all these new\npossibilities, and take into\naccount various other con-siderations. It will target\nthe main issues when it\ncomes to communication\nwithin the department\nand will dedicate a good\npart of its functionality\nto the simplification of\nthe layout. Despite being\nstill in the experimental\nphase, this platform has\nthe potential to perhaps\nbecome a more intuitive,\nuser-friendly alternative\nthe Blackboard. Infotree\nis currently focusing on\nimplementing a plug-in\nwhich would allow\nstudents to import data\ninto their own personal\nspace in order to facilitate\ntheir access to it. The\nfeedback.\nIn the Mechanical\nEngineering Department,\nthere is a website called\nPiazza in certain subjects\nthat acts as an open\ntion to reach all students\nso the questions are not\nasked twice, and allows\nfollow-up questions if\never further explaining\nis required. The way this\nmethod was implemented\nthroughout the department was by making it\nthe only option, forcing\nlecturers to answer solely\non this platform rather\nthan to individual emails\nfrom the students. To a\ncertain extent, this shared\ncollaborative site allows\neveryone to engage with\nthe material, and be\nprovided with quick and\nsimple answers to their\nquestions. Indirectly, this\nalso informs the lecturer\nabout the main topics of\nstruggle, allowing them\nto adapt and shape their\ncourse in order to put\nmore emphasis on certain\nparts, resembling an interactive feedback system.\nHowever, just like Blackboard, the main issue\nhere revolves around the\norganisation and layout\nof the information, as the\nquestions are organised in\nchronological order rather\ntransition of information\nbetween Blackboard and\nInfotree will be effortless\nand quick, and will give\nstudents complete control\nover how they would want\nto organise it. It builds\nupon the current educational website, whilst\nintroducing the possibility for various different\nsources, not only for the\neyes of the individual,\nbut also for the rest of the\ncourse if ever one wishes\nto share some of their\nmaterial.\nAs the website is\nprogressively improved,\nit will allow students in\ntandem with teachers to\ncreate efficient and comprehensive educational\npages that will be passed\ndown through the years\nand constantly reviewed\nand improved upon,\nbased on the feedback of\nthe users. Over time, our\nstudies here at Imperial\nwill become easier for all\nincoming students and\nallow topics to be explored\nmore thoroughly and in\ndepth to give a fuller understanding of the module\nand its application. With\nthis new form of interface,\nthe strain on lectures and\nIssues within blackboard often lead to lots of tabs being open, which doesn\u2019t help productivity// Wait but why\n\u201cThe main\nissue revolves\naround the\norganization\nand layout\u201d\n\u201cInfotree will\ntarget the\nmain issues\nwhen it comes\nto communication within the\ndepartment\u201d\nthan grouped together\nby relevance to a certain\ntopic.\nThere is an emerging\nsite called \u201cInfotree\u201d,\ntutorials is expected to\nreduce, allowing the\npossibility for a greater\npresence of online\nlearning as its importance\nincreases, due to the rapid\nand inevitable digital-isation of information.\nThis surfacing sense of\ncommunity will lead to a\nsense of mutual aid where\nstudents themselves who\nhave a deep understanding of a particular subject\ncould share informational\nand demonstrative videos\nor lectures to the younger\nyears.\nThe principal issues\nwith Blackboard are\nsometimes too present\nand crucial to be ignored,\nand giving the students\nthe possibility to control\ntheir workspace in a more\norganised manner could\nbenefit everyone in the\ndepartment, ridding us\nof a fair amount of unnecessary effort. Ideally,\na website that acts as \u201ca\nplugin where students can\nquickly extract and add\ncontent from anywhere to\njust one place\u201d could be a\nlong awaited innovative\nchange, that will keep on\ndeveloping throughout the\nyears.\n\u201cAn emerging\nsite,\u2018Infotree\u2019,\naims to take\ninto account\nthe main\nissues with the\nlayout\u201d\nplatform where questions\nfrom students can be\nanswered rapidly by the\nlecturer.

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve\nwanted to write about for\na while and, following our\ndiscussion, I felt inspired\nto address the issue. Also,\nin light of International\nWomen\u2019s Day, there\u2019s no\nbetter time to discuss what\nwe, as fans of the culture,\ncan do to tackle the unfortunate omnipresence of\nmisogyny in hip-hop.\nThe first step is to acknowledge the sexism in\nhip-hop. Without getting\ntoo deep into the discussion of disparity within\nthe genre, misogyny in\nhip-hop ranges from the\nmore obvious examples,\nsuch as vulgar lyrics,\nto the subtler instances,\nsuch as the lack of female\nartists on the Wireless\nFestival line-up or the\nbad reputation women\nget for being \u2018difficult\u2019 to\nwork with. Female artists\nare wrongly assumed to\nlack the talent of male\nartists, which in turn\ndeters more women from\ngetting into the genre.\nUnless they maintain a\nhyper-sexualised public\nimage, female hip-hop\nartists simply don\u2019t get the\nsame recognition as their\nmale counterparts and, as\na result, the narrative that\nhip-hop lacks conscious\nfemale MCs is further\nperpetuated.\nAs a genre, hip-hop has\ngained a reputation for\nnot being very accepting\nof women and there is a\ntrend of female MCs being\nthrown under the umbrella\nof \u2018R&B\u2019 or \u2018soul\u2019, rather\nthan hip-hop or rap. R&B\nand soul are generally\nseen as \u2018more feminine\u2019\nthan hip-hop and, by\nthrowing any female artist\nthat incorporates singing\nand melody in her music\ninto the R&B genre, we\neffectively disregard them\nand fail to consider them\nin the conversation of top\nrappers in hip-hop. Would\na woman that makes music\nin the same way as Drake\n(singing and rapping si-multaneously) be classed\nas a hip-hop artist and\njudged in the same way\nthat we rate Drake or any\nother man that incorporates singing and melody\nin their music?\nAs fans of the culture\nin general, it is important\nthat we are intelligent in\nour approach to the music.\nWe need to start thinking\nabout why we like the\nmusic that we do and be\nmore aware of when our\nfavourite artists\u2019 music\ncrosses the line into what\nshould be unacceptable\nterritory. This allows us,\nas fans, to take responsibility and hold our\nfavourite artists accountable for their problematic\nlyrics. There are times\nwhen I think that hip-hop\nculture is slowly moving\ntowards eradicating its\ndeep-rooted misogyny.\nHowever, it almost\nseems like, for every step\ntaken towards tackling\nmisogyny, hip-hop takes\ntwo steps backwards.\nArtists including sexist\ncontent, such as that of old\nschool Snoop Dogg, Dr.\nDre and Eminem, would\nnot be acceptable in this\nday and age and this was\nevidenced by Rick Ross\nlosing his Reebok endorsement for including\nlyrics which allude to date\nrape in his verse on 2013\u2019s\n\u2018U.O.E.N.O.\u2019. However,\nwhile this represented a\nmajor step forward, the\ncasual acceptance in the\nculture of problematic and\nabusive artists, such as\nR. Kelly and the wave of\nmumble rappers who all\nseem to have disturbing\nhistories of domestic\nviolence, is another\nworrying step backward.\nTo tackle misogyny in\nhip-hop, it is important\nto shine a light on the\ndope female artists in the\nscene and celebrate them\njust as much as we do our\nfavourite male artists. The\n\u201cToo Many Man Show\u201d is\na brand new website and\npodcast dedicated to challenging hip-hop\u2019s gender\nnorms and championing\nfemale artists in the genre.\nAlthough hip-hop has\nbeen a genre synonymous\nwith protest and the plight\nof marginalised people,\nthe genre has historically\nbeen a male-dominated\nand carried an anti-wom-an sentiment. The rank\nmisogyny pervading the\ngenre is too often over-looked. This means that\nwomen taking up space\nin hip-hop in general is\na form of activism itself;\nthey\u2019re taking up space in\na genre that has previously\nprided itself on its sexist\nundertones and has been\nparticularly male-dom-inated for a long time.\nThis makes it all the more\nimportant to big up artists\nlike Rapsody, Noname,\nLittle Simz and more\nthat are flying the flag for\nwomen within the culture.\nWe need more outlets\nlike \u201cToo Many Man\u201d to\nensure that female hip-hop\nartists aren\u2019t ignored.\nIt\u2019s also of paramount\nimportance that men get\ninvolved in the conver-sation; it can\u2019t just be the\nwomen getting behind the\nmovement of challenging\nmisogyny in hip-hop.\nMen have to support the\nmovement too for there to\nbe noticeable changes to\none of the ugliest aspects\nof the hip-hop culture that\nwe love so much.\nToo Many Man Show // TooManyMan\nMUSIC\nAndy Djaba\nMusic Editor\nLike what you see?\nWant _more_?\nTune into 2 Gs\nin a Pod \u2013 a new\npodcast \u2013 bringing\nvibes and discussing\nall things culture, on\nSoundCloud, iTunes\nor IC Radio!\n\n"

Yet, at\nno point does one feel that\nthe characters are one-di-mensional \u2013 for example,\nDanny\u2019s violent side kicks\nin when, in the middle of\na very pleasant conver-sation, Dean expresses\ndisbelief when he learnt\nthat Danny did not drink.\nThere is a sense that these\ncasual comments remind\nDanny of the experience\nof never being respect-ed, and triggers him to\nreassert the power balance\nin the pair.\nIssuesinmodernBritish\nsociety are woven into\nthe narrative, including\nDanny\u2019s experiences of\nreligious discrimination\nand school bullying. Both\nare youths who feel that\nthey have hit a dead end,\nwith the army and ISIS\nbeing viable ways out of\ntheir situations. While\nthe show\u2019s exploration of\nterrorism only scratches\nthe surface, it manages to\ngive a nuanced portrayal\nof the issues that highlight\njust how complex and\nmultifaceted the problem\nis \u2013 all the more impressive for an hour-long\nshow.\nIn his post-show talk,\nGreenhough explains that\nhe wanted to use comedy\nto tackle complex issues.\nDr Sarah Ilott, a lecturer\nin film and literature at\nManchester Metropolitan\nUniversity who was also\nspeaking at the talk, said\nthat comedy helps to make\nuncomfortable situations\nmore accessible. Indeed,\nBismillah! is both hilarious and deeply serious,\nand a valuable addition to\nthe conversation around\nradicalising youth.\nP\nhilipp Oberlohr\nknows you. He\nknows your past,\nand can predict\nyour future. Or at least, he\nclaims he does. Dubbed as\n\u2018Vienna\u2019s master illusionist\u2019, Oberlohr returned to\nthe Vault Festival with a\nnew mind-reading show,\nDas Fest.\nDespite Oberlohr being\nbranded as an illusionist,\nthe show was less an illu-sionary experience than an\ninteractive mind-reading\nshow. Using audience\u2019s\nstories written on slips of\npaper, he makes a show\nof being able to predict\ntheir memories and future\nwithout reading them.\nOberlohr appears on stage\nwearing a furry cape, and\ndelivers a speech involving polar bears and Freud.\nHe then splits the audience\ninto two; from one group\nhe asks for a past memory,\nand from the other he asks\nfor a dare for themselves.\nThese slips of paper were\nthen folded up and left in\numbrellas on the stage.\nWhile it is conceivable\nthat impressive sleights of\nhand allowed him to read\nthese slips without the\naudience noticing, there\nwere some truly baffling\ntricks, such as correctly\npredicting audience\nmembers\u2019 birthdays and\nstar signs. In between\ndrawing out audience\u2019s\ndares and physically illustrating memories using\nprops, Oberlohr tries to\nlink these stories together\nwith lyrical imagery and\nmetaphysical musings\nabout the influence of\nmemories and fears about\nthe future.\nAfter a spiel about a\nhouse on fire and shoelaces that tie all the elements\nof one\u2019s life together,\nrunning back to a pair of\nshoes in the centre of the\nfire, Oberlohr picks up\na slip of paper and reads\noff a memory about a flat\nburning down and the\nonly thing he saved being\na pair of shoes gifted by\nhis girlfriend. Details\nsuch as these suggest\nthat not every memory\nhe picks up might be\ntrue. However, perhaps\nthat was not meant to be\nseen as \u2018mind-reading\u2019 as\nmuch as an accessory to\nhis overarching theme.\nThe nature of mind-reading shows requires\none to suspend one\u2019s dis-beliefandsimplyenjoythe\ntricks. If I allow myself to\nfully immerse in the possibility of mind-reading,\nthe show was fairly enter-taining. No doubt also that\nOberlohr was very skilful\nin executing his tricks.\nHowever, the lyrical\nimagery used to link the\nindividual tricks together\nare slightly contrived.\nA coherent storyline or\noverarching theme is\nimportant in shows such\nas these, and in this case,\nI believe could have been\nmore fluent. Nevertheless,\nOberlohr himself is a very\nlikeable personality, and\nDas Fest entertained.\n\u2018What, WHSmith meal deals cost \u00a34.99?!\u2019// Wound Up Theatre\nBen Whishaw delivers layered performance as Brutus\nInnovative staging, classic rock and modern costuming, makes The Bridge\u2019s adaptation an unique experience.\nT\nhere was a time\nwe killed the\nKing/ We tried\nto change the\nworld too fast/ Now we\nhave got another King/\nHe is no better than the\nlast.\u201d \u2013 I found this play\nresonated rather neatly (or\nshould I say vice versa)\nwith the lyrics from Les\nMis\u00e9rables\u2019 musical\nfilm in 2012. In this\nmodern-dress production\nof Shakespeare\u2019s Julius\nCaesar in Bridge Theatre\ndirected by Nicholas\nHytner, the relations\nbetween populism and autocracy was explored with\na new layer of complexity\ngranted by the promenade\nexperience.\nThe play started with\nlive rock music. After\nCaesar\u2019s triumphant\nreturn from war, senators\nCassius and Brutus\nfeared he had become\ntoo powerful and might\naccept the offer to become\nthe emperor of Rome.\nThough Brutus hesitated\nto take action, he was\neventually convinced\nby Cassius. The two\nplanned the assassination\nwith their conspirators.\nOn the Ides of March,\nCaesar ignored multiple\nwarnings that a assassination might take place,\nincluding the one from his\nwife Calpurnia, and went\nto the Senate. Suddenly,\ngunshot tore through the\nair, and the crowd fell\nto the ground in shock,\nrevealing the conspirators\nholding their guns. Caesar\nwas shot and paralysed\non his throne, and then he\nsaw Brutus, his very dear\nfriend among the assas-sins. Silence fell, tension\n\u201cNo two\npeople\u2019s\nexperiences of\nthe play will be\nthe same\u201d\n\u201cMichelle\nFairley\ndelivered\nan eloquent\nand precise\nperformance\u201d\nbuilt, and was resolved\nby the famous line: \u201cEt\ntu, Brute?\u201d Then, Caesar\nopened his arms, accepting his inevitable death,\nand was killed by Brutus\u2019\nfinal shot. Brutus delivered a speech to the public\nexplaining the reason\nof the assassination. He\nclaimed though he loved\nCaesar, he loved Rome\nmore, and he did what\nhe did for the liberation\nof its people. Absurdly,\nwhen the crowd came\nto accept and support\nBrutus for his actions,\nthey exclaimed \u201cLet him\nbe Caesar!\u201d, completely\nmissing Brutus\u2019 point,\nechoing with Cassius\u2019\nprevious statement regarding Caesar: \u201cI know\nhe wouldn\u2019t be a wolf if\nthe Romans didn\u2019t act\nlike sheep\u201d,. Antony,\nCaesar\u2019s supporter, was\nallowed to give a speech\nat the funeral. Though he\npromised not to blame\nthe death of Caesar on\nthe conspirators, Antony\nsecretly swore to avenge\nCaesar, and incited the\npublic against Brutus.\nAntony teamed up with\nOctavius and Lepidus to\nfight Brutus and his ac-complices. The war ended\nwith Brutus and Cassius\nboth committing suicide.\nAfter Antony found their\nbodies, he praised Brutus\nas \u201cthe noblest Roman\nof them all\u201d and returned\nto Rome to celebrate his\nvictory.\nThe play made some\ninteresting adaptations\nto suit its modern-dress\nproduction. The assassination was done by gun\ninstead of knife, giving\nit a more contemporary\nvisual and sound impact.\nFurthermore, in the\noriginal play, Antony\nprovoked animosity of\nthe crowd towards Brutus\nand his accomplices by\nallocating each wound\non Caesar\u2019s body to a\nparticular conspirator. In\nthis version this was done\nby allocating the tears on\nthe lining of Caesar\u2019s suit\nleft by the bullets.\nMarcus Brutus was an\nambiguous character. He\nwas driven by both the\ngreater good and self-in-terest, though he committed a dreadful murder\nhe was nevertheless\ndriven by his morals. Ben\nWishaw brought a layer\nof irony to this noblest\nmurderer, entertained the\ncrowd to disbelieving\nlaughter when he tried\nto justify his motivation.\nMichelle Fairley delivered an eloquent and\nprecise performance as\nCaius Cassius. She was\ndetermined and manip-ulative, cruel but not\nwithout tenderness. David\nCalder sold his Caesar as\na populist with authority\nand ego; his personal\ncharisma won the cheers\nof the audience when he\nmarched across the crowd.\nDavid Morrisey gave a\npassionate and opportunistic Mark Antony, and\nAdjoa Andoh was simply\nspectacular as Casca.\nBridge Theatre is a very\nintimate space. The stalls\nseating was removed for\nthis play to give audience\nwith standing tickets a\npromenade experience as\none of the mob in the play.\nThe round staging limited\nthe stage settings, but this\nwas counterbalanced by\nthe atmosphere created\nby the lighting and sound\ndesigned by Bruno Poet\nand Paul Arditti, led by\nthe stage designer Bunny\nChristie. Spatial flexibility\nwas also achieved by the\nrises and falls of different\nparts of the stage, which,\napart from conveying\nthe play with further\ndimensions, aided the\ndynamics of the crowd.\nYou can choose your own\nperspectives throughout\nthe play \u2013 either from\nthe front or the side, and\neither wide-angle from\ndistant or close-up from\nbeside the stage \u2013 and\nhear different conversations in the crowd. At the\nend of the night, you will\nleave with your unique\nmontage, knowing that no\ntwo experiences would be\nthe same.\nThis play is ultimately\nabout an attempt to end\ndictatorship with the\ndeath of the dictator. We\ncan see in retrospect that\nthe assassination led to a\nseries of civil wars, which\nresulted in autocracy for\nthe rest of Rome\u2019s history.\nThis play has remained\nso contemporary because\nhistory continually repeats\nitself. What matters is not\nthe fall of the dictator, but\nwho and what follows\nhim.\nDavid Morissey as Julius Caesar // Manuel Harlan\nARTS\nZie Yang\nArts Writer\nWhere?

The strikes\nare scheduled to continue\nthroughout all of next\nweek.\nUCUhavebeenmeeting\nwith UUK this week, with\nthe conciliation service\nAcas as a mediator, to\ndiscuss a solution to the\ncurrent pensions dispute.\nUUK, the governing body\nfor UK higher education\ninstitutions, wants to\nput through a number\nof changes to the USS\npension scheme. UUK\nclaim that a \u00a37.5 billion\ndeficit means the changes\nare needed, a position\nUCU disputes. UCU say\nthe changes could mean\nmembers of the scheme\n\u2013 which includes both academic and support staff\n\u2013 lose up to \u00a310,000 per\nyear in pension payments.\nWhile UCU had originally scheduled 14 days\nof strikes in escalating\nwaves, they say further\naction may be warranted\n\u201cin defence of our pensions\u201d. 65 higher education institutions would\nface further strike action,\nwhich would take place\nbetween April and June.\nUCU have not specified\ndates for the strikes, but\nsay they would \u201cgather information on when the 14\ndays of action would be\nmost effective at different\nuniversities.\u201d\nSally Hunt, general\nsecretary of the UCU,\nsaid: \u201cI want to stress\nthat I consider all this\na necessary precaution\nagainst the failure of talks\nto deliver an acceptable\nsettlement. The union\nwould prefer dialogue and\nI have given my personal\ncommitment to Acas that\nUCU is serious about\nreaching an agreement.\u201d\nweeks ago, and the email\nshows \u201cthe Provost and\nVice-Provost for Education [sic] have apparently\nno idea how examinations\nat Imperial work.\u201d\nInastatementpublished\nearlier this week, Professor Stirling and Professor\nAlice Gast, President, said\nthey \u201crecognise and regret\nthe impact that the current\nUCU strike is having on\nteaching\u2026 [senior staff]\nhave been working with\nDepartment representatives to advise on the development of local plans\nto minimise the impact on\nour students\u2019 education.\nThis work will of course\ncontinue.\u201d\nLast week the College\nchanged their position on\nthe UUK valuation of the\nUSS deficit, calling for the\nconvening of an expert\ngroup by UUK and USS to\nreassess the deficit. They\nsaid assembling the group\nmay push them past the\ndeadline for changes to be\nmade, but they would stay\nin the current scheme until\nthe work is completed.\nIn the update to staff,\nProf. Stirling and Prof.\nGast said they had met\nwith Richard Craster\nfrom the Department of\nMathematics, to discuss\n\u201chow best to take forward\nour call for UUK and the\nUSS to convene an expert\ngroup, including university academics, to look\nclosely at the valuation\nwork, and be fully open\nand transparent about\nwhat they find.\u201d\nIn a statement, Dr\nMichael McGarvey, President of Imperial UCU,\nsaid: \u201cafter nine days of\nstrikes, and despite the\nweather, the UCU picket\nlines were just as strong\nand the members just as\ndetermined as they were\non day one. The branch\nat Imperial continues to\ngrow rapidly, now up\n36% since the dispute\nstarted. While the recent\nmoves by senior leaders at\nImperial \u2013 as well as those\nelsewhere \u2013 are welcome,\nif they are genuine in\nwanting to have a fair\nagreement on pensions\nthen they have to make\nsure UUK changes its\nhard-line position.\u201d\n\u201cThe current Acas talks\nbetween UCU and UUK\ncontinue, and UCU\u2019s\ncommitment to a negotiated solution remains\nundimmed. So far,\nhowever, there has been\nno agreement at Acas.\u201d\nProfessor Tom Pike,\nImperial UCU\u2019s local\nVice-President, said the\nstrike action was \u201cunprecedented\u201d. He told Felix:\n\u201cWhat has been crystallised from this action is a\nmuch broader recognition\nthat the balance between\nthe academic and financial interests of Imperial,\nwith the latter expected\nto serve the former, has\nbeen completely reversed.\nSenior management have\nadmitted as much, that\nImperial\u2019s support of\nUUK to move entirely\nto a defined contribution\npension scheme represented shifting the risk\nfrom Imperial's balance\nsheet to individual staff.\u201d\n\u201cAt this point we don\u2019t\nknow whether the current\ntalks at ACAS are leading\nto an agreement. We do\nknow that staff at Imperial will never see senior\nmanagement here in quite\nthe same light. The next\nitem on the agenda, after\nthe defence of pensions\nhas been completed, is a\nclosing not of any suggested pension deficit, but\nrather the yawning democratic deficit which has\nopened wide at Imperial.\u201d\nImperial is one of a\nnumber of universities\nwho have broken with\nUUK\u2019s stance: earlier this\nweek the University of\nOxford announced they\nwould reconsider their\nposition. The move comes\nfollowing a meeting of\nstaff on Tuesday \u2013 known\nas a congregation \u2013 in\nwhich a debate over the\nchanges was blocked.\nHundreds of staff then left\nthe venue, and organised\na separate vote on a resolution to change Oxford\u2019s\nposition, which passed\n442 votes to two.\nLouise Richardson,\nOxford\u2019s vice-chancellor,\nsaid: \u201cIn light of the depth\nof feeling of so many colleagues we will convene\na special meeting of\ncouncil\u2026 and will be recommending that council\nreverses its response to\nthe UUK survey in line\nwith congregation\u2019s resolution.\u201d\nCambridge, Manchester, St Andrews, and\nWarwick universities have\nall also moved away from\nthe UUK position.\nStaff put up banners this week outside Imperial // Bob MacCallum\n\u201cUCU have\nsanctioned\nanother 14\ndays of strike\naction during\nexam season if\ntalks fail\u201d\nHow the strikes will\naffect examinations has\nbeen a concern for both\nstudents and staff. Last\nmonth, Professor James\nStirling, Provost, and Professor Simone Buitendijk,\nVice-Provost (Education),\nsaid \u201cno students would be\nplaced at a disadvantage\ndue to the strike\u201d and they\nwould \u201cnot be examined\non any material that you\nhave not been taught.\u201d It\nis, as of yet, unclear how\nthe College will define\nmissed content.\nHowever, this promise\nhas been disputed by\nsome staff. A number of\nstudents in the Department of Computing, for\nexample, have been told\nthe examinations were set\nStudents raise concerns over organisation of this year's\nLeadership Elections\nNEWS\nStudents have had\ncomplaints about\no r g a n i s a t i o n ,\ncommunication, and\nenforcement of rules.\nFred Fyles\nEditor-in-Chief\nA\nnumber of\nstudents have\ncriticised Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) for poor\nplanning and execution\nof this year\u2019s Leadership\nElections, which finish\ntoday.\nStudents have highlighted problems with\ncommunication, organisa-tion, and enforcement of\ncampaign rules.\nDuring the past week, a\nnumber of candidates and\nstudents have voiced their\nconcern over students\nbreaching election campaign rules. Candidates\nrunning for positions in\nMachine Learning Society\nand Finance Society have\nbeen accused of breaching\nelection rules by making\nuse of existing mailing\nlists and unsolicited com-munications.\nWhile students raised\ncomplaints to the Deputy\nReturning Officers\n(DROs), many felt their\ncomplaints had not been\ndealt with properly. One\nstudent told Felix: \u201cThe\ncomplaints process is\nnot transparent at all\u2026\ncomplainants aren\u2019t\nupdated about how their\ncomplaints have been\ndealt with \u2013 and if they\nare, they are only told that\ncomplaints are \u2018handled\u2019.\nI find it absurd how there\nare candidates with clear\nbribery on their manifesto\nwho have not been disqualified.\u201d\nEarlier this week,\nhowever, seven candidates\nwere disqualified from the\nLeadership Elections in\nresponse to \u201cpersistent\nbreaking of rules and\nacting against [ICU\u2019s]\nvalues despite warnings\nfrom the [DROs]\u201d. They\nsaid the students had\nbroken rules by coercing\nvoters, campaigning in\nlanguages other than\nEnglish without a transla-tion, and use of pre-exist-ing mailing lists.\u201d\nIn a statement for Felix,\na Union spokesperson\nsaid: \u201cWe\u2019ve had about\nthe expected number\nof complaints this year\nand the DROs have\nbeen dealing with them\nswiftly and effectively;\ncandidates should bear\nin mind that this is not\nalways visible from the\noutside. The vast majority\nof offending candidates\nreceive one warning and\ndon\u2019t reoffend.\u201d\nOutside of these com-plaints, students have also\ncited problems with the\ngeneral organisation of\nthe Leadership Elections.\nCandidates who spoke to\nFelix said there was a lack\nof clarity from ICU over\nthe timing and details of\nevents, and responses to\nemails were poor.\nOne candidate, speaking to Felix, said the\nelections this year were\n\u201cdisappointing\u201d: \u201cAs a\ncandidate, I have time and\ntime again been left in the\ndark about many aspects\nof the election process,\nmost notably the election\ndebate, which seems to\nhave been totally forgotten until the last moment \u2013\ntotally inexcusable when\nMeet the Candidates has\nbeen a feature of all recent\nspring elections.\u201d\n\u201cThe Union needs\nto have a good hard\nlook at itself and decide\nwhether it truly believes\nin democracy or just in\nwindow-dressing popularity contests. I for one\nhope that it chooses the\nformer.\u201d\nCriticism was also directed against ICU\u2019s live\ndebate, which aired earlier\nthis week.\nOn Wednesday, 7th\nMarch, ICU organised\ntheir \u201cDebate Livestream\u201d, at which candidates for major positions\nwere asked about their\nplans if elected. Out of the\neight positions advertised\nas being included in the\ndebate, only four sessions\nwere able to go ahead,\nafter a number of candidates did not attend. In\ntotal, out of 30 potential\ncandidates, only six at-tended.\nthe candidates after thirty\nseconds, leaving no time\nto actually hear useful\ncontent.\nIn response, a representative of ICU said:\n\u201cPlease note we have not\naddressed any criticism\ndirected at the Union,\nbut only corrected factual\nerrors such as Board decisions and the bars having\nprofessional managers.\u201d\nThe debate, which in\nprevious years has been\norganised by Imperial\nCollege TV (ICTV), was\norganised internally by\nICU, after ICTV pulled\nout of the show, saying\nthey \u201cwere unable to\nreceive the required\ntimely support needed\nfrom the Union to do the\nbroadcast.\u201d\nIn a statement for Felix,\na Union spokesperson\nsaid: \u201cWe know there have\nbeen mixed reviews of the\nnew elections timetable\nthis year, with a small\npercentage of candidates\nviewing it negatively; we\nhave consistently received\nrequests from candidates\nto shorten the timetable in\nprevious years and we\u2019re\npleased to have put this\nnew model to the test.\u201d\n\u201cSeparately, several\ncandidates were understandably unhappy at\ncommunication regarding\nthe Live Debates, which\nwe have fully accepted\nand acknowledged directly to candidates and\nstudent societies.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to\nreceive feedback from all\nmembers on the elections,\nand we\u2019ll be surveying\nall candidates about their\nexperiences as well.\nOverall, we\u2019re pleased to\nhave once again delivered\na nation-leading election\nturnout and engaged\nmore candidates and\nstudent groups than any\nother student election in\nhistory.\u201d\n\u201cOne\ncandidate\nsaid he had\nbeen 'left in\nthe dark' over\nmany aspects\nof the election\u201d\nStudents questioned\nthe timing of the debate.\nKelvin Zhang, a first-year computing student,\ntold Felix the debate was\n\u201cvery poorly organised\u201d:\n\u201cif you check the voting\nproportions for last year\u2019s\nelections, you\u2019ll see that\nmore than 2/3 of those\nwho could vote at this\npoint had already done\nso. Most people who will\nvote have already voted.\nIt\u2019s completely ridiculous\nthat a debate is being organised almost at the end\nof elections.\u201d\nOther students also\nraised criticism of the\nmoderation of the debate,\nparticularly when the\nmoderator responded to\nclaims about ICU and\ncut candidates off after\na 30-second time limit.\nWriting on Facebook, one\nstudent said it was \u201cquite\nappalling that a debate\nbetween students is being\nmediated by someone\nwho \u2018corrects\u2019 any time\nthe candidates make a\ncriticism of the central\nUnion and staff.\u201d\nZhang said: \u201cthe debate\nformat was poor, with the\nmoderator being Union\nstaff\u2026and interrupting\nThis week is the last time we have to use this photo!

With a peak\nhigher than Ben Nevis\nin Scotland (the highest\nmountain in the British\nIsles) and many spots\nfor hiking and climbing,\nthis Mediterranean island\noffers adventures and\nexcitement for the more\noutdoor-loving students.\nOn my recent climbing\ntrip to Mallorca together\nwith the Imperial Outdoor\nClub (that participates in\na wide range of outdoor\npursuits) just before\nChristmas, I experienced\na more daring side of\nthe island. While not\nas popular as mainland\nSpain for climbing, it\nboasts routes spanning\nfrom \u2018beginner\u2019 to\n\u2018expert\u2019 levels of diffi-culty, with more than\nenough to satisfy months\nof climbing, let alone a\nsingle week. There are\nmany crags (climbing\nspots) around the island,\nalthough by far the biggest\nand best one is Sa Gubia.\nIt offers incredible views\nand routes up to 200 m\nlong, and is well worth the\nlengthy walk to the start\nof the climb. While we\nonly managed to squeeze\nin one day there due to\nlogistics and wanting to\nvisit many of the other\nareas on the island, we\ncould have easily spent the\nwhole week there as we\nonly scratched the surface\nof what was on offer, with\nmultiple day-long routes\nleft for another trip.\nOne of the other mem-The breath-taking views of Valldemossa you won\u2019t see at a nightclub // Salome Bodet Lefevre\nMallorca \u2013 more than just a party island!\norable crags was Valldemossa, which is situated just\noutside a small village of\nthe same name and has\nincredible views over\nthe sea. The only real\ndrawback of the area was\nthat to ascend the rock we\nneeded to climb above the\nroad, so we had to keep\nour senses heightened\na bit more than usual.\nBesides Valldemossa,\nwe also managed to visit\nseveral other climbing\nareas with great routes\nand breath-taking views.\nMallorca is also home\nto some of the best Deep\nWater Soloing (DWS)\nin the world, whereby\nclimbers don\u2019t use ropes\nand rely on falling into\nthe deep water below that\ncushions their fall. Despite\nthe allure of some of the\nbest and most challenging\nDWS routes in the world,\nwe decided to stay on the\nland as the sea can get a\nbit too nippy in December.\nOf course, one of the\nperks of going to Mallorca\nduring the off-peak season\nis the low cost: return\nflights were under \u00a350\nand accommodation for\na week was less than \u00a310\nper night. Plus, the food\nis far better than what\nyou can expect to get\nin London for the same\nprice, and if you decide to\nhave a tipple, the wine that\nyou can get for a couple\nof pounds at the local\nsupermarket goes down a\nlot better than cheap UK\nwines (the \u20ac1.50 Cava is a\nparticular treat). Although\nit\u2019s pretty much essential\nto hire a car to get around\nand explore the island,\nthis doesn\u2019t add much to\nthe overall expenses as it\ncan cost as little as \u00a335\nper week \u2013 and if there are\nfour of you in the vehicle,\nit becomes ludicrously\ncheap.\nWhile December might\nnot seem like the perfect\ntime to visit the Balearic\nIslands, the temperature\nwas still a warm-ish 15\u00b0C\nand far hotter than the UK\nwas experiencing. The\nslightly lower temperature\nis also better for climbing\nas the summer highs\nof around 30\u00b0C make\nclimbing almost unbeara-ble. It does get a bit chilly\nat night and when the sun\nhides behind the clouds or\na rock face, but it\u2019s made\nup for by the feeling of\nachievement that you can\nget when you reach the\ntop of a climb and can\nlook down on the route\nyou\u2019ve just conquered.\nSo if you harbour even\nthe smallest interest in the\ngreat outdoors, Mallorca\nis certainly well worth a\nvisit. The low cost of a\ntrip there should be more\nthan enough to entice a\nstudent, but the views and\nterrain alone easily rival\nthose of more famous\ndestinations in Europe\nand will hopefully lead to\nmore tourists going there\nto explore the countryside\nrather than spending all\nnight on the Magaluf\nStrip.\nThe IC Outdoor Club\nregularly holds both\nindoor and outdoor\nclimbing activities, and,\nas well as organising trips\nabroad, arranges multiple\ntrips within the UK each\nterm for hiking, mountain\nbiking, climbing, and\nmore. Contact outdoor@\nic.ac.uk for more infor-mation.\nSa Gubia crag surely looks welcoming if you\u2019re up for a challenge! // Flickr\n\u201cMallorcan\nviews and\nterrain easily\nrival those of\nmore famous\ndestinations in\nEurope\u201d\nTom Whiting\nTravel Writer\nTRAVEL\n\n"

Data published\nby UCAS last year revealed that Imperial is\ntop in student inequality\nin the UK, just ahead of\nOxford and 8 places\nahead of Cambridge. At\nImperial, students from\nhigh income backgrounds\nare 11 times more likely\nto be accepted. These\nfindings should serve as\na wake-up call. There is\na clear issue and we now\nmust address it. Firstly,\nwhy is inequality such a\nbig issue at Imperial? And\nmore importantly, how\ncan we solve it?\nPerhaps the issue is in\nImperial\u2019s location. Being\nbased in the most expensive city in the UK and an\nexpensive neighbourhood\nwithin it could be a barrier\nfor students from lower\nincome families. Perhaps\nmoving part of the campus\nin less central areas of\nLondon where living is\nmore affordable would\nimprove the situation.\nHowever, the issue is\nnot only in Imperial\u2019s\nlocation as inequalities are\nseen in many universities,\nespecially those that are\nhigh in rankings. In 2014,\nonly 23% of state school\nstudents went into universities ranked in the top\nthird compared with 65%\nfrom private schools. This\ncould be due to high admission grades. Imperial\nrequires a high A level\nperformance like other\nhigh ranking universities.\nStudents from lower\nincome backgrounds are\nless likely to achieve these\ngrades simply because\nstate schools invested\nless in performance.\nThis means that bright\nstudents, despite having\nthe same capabilities, do\nworse in exams simply\nbecause they attended a\nschool in a different area.\nShockingly, this can be\nrealised by a \u2018state school\npenalty\u2019, in order to have\nthe same chances of\ngetting into high ranking\nuniversities, students have\nto get one grade higher in\ntheir A levels. So, even if\ndisadvantaged students\nget the same results,\nthey are less likely to be\naccepted. This problem is\nnot unique to high ranking\nuniversities. In the UK,\nstudents from more disadvantaged backgrounds\nare twice less likely to\nget into university. Does\nthis reflect a problem in\nEngland\u2019s application\nsystem then? It could be\nthat admissions teams\nhave some implicit bias\nagainst students coming\nfrom more disadvantaged\nareas? In 2006, David\nCameron suggested\nadopting name blind\napplications to deal with\nthe problem and some\nuniversities have started\nto try it out.\nUniversities are aware\nof the problem and trying\nto tackle it. Some have\nmade big improvements\nbut progress is much\nslower in top ranking uni-versities, such as Imperial.\nWe should look at universities such as LSE who\nhave started training the\nadmissions team against\nimplicit bias. Kings have\nstarted giving offers with\nlower grades to disadvantaged students to help\nthem get accepted. Some\ncolleges at Oxford have\nalso created a foundation\nyear for disadvantaged\nstudents who have grades\nslightly lower than the\nrequired ones. Perhaps the\nreason Imperial came out\nas number 1 most unequal\nis that we just don\u2019t do\nenough to help disadvantaged students. Why did\nwe turn down the proposal\nof a working class\nliberation officer? Why\nare we not also pushing\ninnovative schemes which\naddress the issue?\nHowever, we can\u2019t\nbe too harsh. Imperial\ndoes have activities to\ninvolve stimulate interest\nin STEM subjects at state\nschools as well as an incredibly generous bursary\nscheme and scholarships.\nAlso, we must not forget\nImperial is one of the only\nuniversities in the UK\nwilling to act as a guarantor for students who need\nit. Imperial\u2019s shameful\nstatistics highlight a\nmore support. Also,\nstudents from more disadvantaged backgrounds\nface different challenges\nso perhaps university is\nnot a priority, especially\nwhen they receive no help\nthrough the difficult application process. So even\nmotivation wise (without\nconsidering the more\ntechnical aspects considered before) students\nfrom lower income\nbackgrounds apply to university less irrespective of\ntheir capabilities. Finally,\nthe problem doesn\u2019t end\nonce the students get into\nuniversity. Students from\nlower incomes are more\nlikely to drop out of their\ncourses too.\nOptions like thinking\nabout campus location\nand changing the application process are great\nand are a step in the right\ndirection. However, I\nbelieve we should also\ntackle the real root of\nthe problem. We should\nmotivate low income\nstudents by showing them\nuniversity is definitely\nan option for them and\nhelping make applying\nless daunting to them. An\nexcellent example of this\nare organisations which\naim to reach out to bright,\nlow income students to\nhelp them with applica-tions. Such an organisation is Project Access, has\nactually set up a branch in\nImperial this year. Their\naim is to recruit Imperial\nstudents as mentors\nto help disadvantaged\nstudents apply. This I\nthink is a great approach\nto the problem. Students\ncan help students! By\nbecoming mentors, or\nsimply supporting the\ncause, our experience of\ngetting into university\ncould help decrease ine-qualities.\nLet\u2019s not turn our back on equality // Flickr/mikecogh\n\u201cKings have\nstarted\ngiving offers\nwith lower\ngrades to\ndisadvantaged\nstudents\u201d\nbigger issue.\nThe huge gap has\ndeep roots. Even if they\ndo achieve the grades,\nstudents from low income\nbackgrounds are simply\nless likely to apply. This\ncould simply be because\nlow income students are\nbrought up with different\nexpectations. Children\nfrom wealthier families\nare often expected to go\nto university. But for a\nchild from a different\nbackground, for example,\nwhose parents didn\u2019t go to\nuniversity and was never\nexpected to go himself,\nit makes sense that he\nis less likely to apply.\nMaking the problem\neven worse, students at\nprivate schools receive\nIn the Heights \u2013 a musical that should be open\nto all\nIn the Heights conductor Dr Vicente Chavaria thinks that any performance of In the Heights\nis a celebration of Latino culture, no matter who performs it.\nCOMMENT\nDr Vicente\nChavarr\u00eda\nComment Writer\nL\nast week\u2019s comment article \u2018In\nthe Whites\u2019 (re-garding Imperial\nMusical Theatre Society\u2019s\nproduction of Lin-Manuel\nMiranda\u2019s In the Heights)\nreignited the old argument\nof \u2018whitewashing\u2019 works\nintended to feature or\nrepresent non-white or\n\u2018marginalised\u2019 groups:\na relevant and worthy\none, certainly, and one\nwe shall be having for\nyears, though one I will\nnot indulge in here. The\narticle did, however, end\nwith a poignant question:\n\u201cIf [MTSoc] knew that\nthey would not be able to\ngive the majority of roles\nto Latino students, why\nattempt to put on a musical about Latinos?\u201d\nBoth Miranda and Quiara\nHudes (author of the\nmusical\u2019s book) have\npreviously accepted \u2013 and\nin fact encouraged \u2013 educational productions that\nincluded cast members\n\u201cof all stripes\u201d. Why, then,\nshould a group of talented\nyoung performers who\nclearly love, respect, and\nadmire the material be\nprevented from undertaking such a venture by the\ncolour of their skin or the\nlanguage of origin of their\nsurname? If the production were professionally\nstaged with auditions open\nacross the country (or\nbeyond), then the restrictions and concerns would\nbe welcome. But this is a\ndifferent ballgame. As a\ncast member mentioned,\nMTSoc\u2019s demographic is\na representation of that of\na large London university.\nWhat MTSoc has done\nis pull off a difficult,\nbeautiful production of\na musical that celebrates\nLatino culture with the\nteam that it has, regardless\nof colour or ethnicity.\nThe author of \u2018In the\nWhites\u2019 described a lack\nof Latinos in the cast or\ndirectorial team, apparently missing the white\nredhead Chilean playing\nCarla, or the Nicaraguan-American conductor of\nthe production (and author\nof the present rebuttal). At\nno point during the entire\nproduction was any part\nof Latin American culture\ntreated with anything less\nthan the utmost respect\nand love. Perhaps the\nproduction was uncomfortable for some viewers,\nincluding the author of\n\u2018In the Whites\u2019, but for\nalmost everyone \u2013 including this Latino \u2013 it was a\nwelcome celebration of a\nbeautifully diverse group\nof people, one not limited\nto a preconceived idea\nof skin colour, linguistic\ncapability/accent, or\neven national identity.\nMoreover, In the Heights\nis a close examination\nof issues like identity,\ngentrification, inequality,\nracism, poverty, alcohol-the Whites\u2019 missed, most\nof all, is the exposure to\nthe grounded, real-world\nLatin-American experience that, unlike other\nshows, Miranda\u2019s musical\nprovides. Most of all, it\nblatantly ignored the hard\nwork and talent of a top-notch cast and crew who\nworked ungodly hours\nto bring this production\nto life. Of all the lessons\nIn the Heights offers,\nperhaps none is more\nrelevant and powerful than\nits unabashed alabanza of\ncommunity. What event\ncould give the participants\nand viewers a better\nchance to learn about one,\nand of the nuances of its\nculture, than by staging\none of the finest musicals\nThe IC production of In the Heights// Jeevan Soor; Olly Dove\n\u201cPeople should\nspend more\ntime engaging\nwith the\ncommunity\nthey seek to\ndefend\u201d\nism, just to name a few.\nThese are issues which\naffect people of all gener-ations, races, and origins,\neven when the visuals do\nnot match the ethnicity of\nthe characters.\nThe performers on\nstage did not wear ethnicity like a skin or disguise.\nThey embodied three-di-mensional characters as\nbest as they could, in their\nown skins and voices\n(beyond a little makeup\nto age one character\nfifty years). None of the\nrappers rapped in accents\nthat weren\u2019t their own.\nAt no point was anything\ndone with the idea of\ncaricature, mockery, or\nstereotyping.
