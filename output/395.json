    "content": "10 JILIX\nBRAM S0ET OUR REPORT For the third year in succession the\nImperial College Union Dramatic Society\n(known familiarly as Dramsoc) chose to\ntour in the south of England during the\nfirst two weeks of July. By way of a change from our established pattern of\nplays out of copyright, we selected two\nmodern works \u2014 \" Hands Across The Sea\" by Noel Coward and \" The Real Inspector\nHound\" by Tom Stoppard. The latter play\nwas a new presentation of part of our\nDecember production whilst the former\nhas never been publicly performed at IC .\nSo it was that we loaded two large\nvans with enough theatrical equipment to\nkeep our technicians happy for a fortnight,\nand enough food to keep the actors replete\nfor a few days; for If has been observed\nby generations of Dramsoc tourists that\nwhereas Lymington has an ample supply\nof cheese, Branston pickle and bread, the\nchance of finding a P817 valve or a circular go bo are remote .\nOur first port of call was the Lord\nMayor Treloar College for handicapped\nboys at Alton. They were particularly\nenthusiastic when an actor in a wheelchair attempted to run down a fellow\nthespian. Having negotiated various one\nway streets, new forest ponies and so on\nwe found ourselves at Lymington. Now\nclearly, if you are an ambitious yachtsman\n.Lymington is the place to be, for It is\nby Thomas Stevenson\ndelightfully situated on the Lymington\nRiver and is convenient for the Isle of\nWight ferry. However the inhabitants are\nnot keen theatre goers and it was only\nwith a great deal of cavorting up the high\nstreet in our costumes and purchasing\nlarge numbers of St. John's Ambulance\nBrigade flags that we were able to get\nthe hall 2 0 % full, (confession - the total\ncapacity of the hall is only about sixty),\nfor the Friday nt gh t performance. Saturday's performance fared better as large numbers\nof loyal fans motored down from London\nto give us support-swelling the audience\nto twenty. Perhaps next year we should\nreturn to our earlier practice of performing\nperiod pieces since people tend to notice\nyou in the market on Saturday morning if\nyou are dressed as a Roman centurion\nwhereas they think nothing of someone\nwearing evening dress. Our next stop was in Beaumlnster,\nDorset. Here the only thing of note was\nthe remarkable midnight thunderstorm and\ngale force winds .Fortunately a house was\nprovided for our ac como dati on and we had\nample time to strike our tents by the light\nof the prolonged flashes of lightning.\nApart from this one night, the weather\nwas remarkably good though, of course,\nwe were not to know of the heat wave to\ncome.\nFinally we reached Dorchester and its\nCorn Exchange (where. Hardy fanatics\nwill remember, Bathsheba Everdene saw\nSergeant Troy, whom she thought drowned).\nThe initial audience . response was\ndisappointing, despite the profusion of\nposters and handbills distributed among\nthe locals. We were saved by the local\ncarnival procession which we entered and\ntwo hectic days were spent preparing\neye-catching posters and decorations with\nwhich to adorn our van. In the space of\nhalf an hour we disposed of one thousand\nhand bills and the following n iq ht saw\nthem flooding in to witness our final night.\nIt was a pity that we marred such a successful publicity exercise by our\nnatural exuberance in the final perform-ance. Our ret run to London was without\n.incident - s uprising considering the merrymaking that had gone on the previous night\nOur thanks are due to so many people\nthat it would be impossible to name them\nall here. Despite the apparent hectic\nnature of the tour much time was found\nfor drinking*, swimming, f res be eing and\nsun-worshipping.* If this sounds like your\nglass of cider Why not join us? Our\nstoreroom on the 21\n/i floor of the Union\nOffice is open for talk and coffee until\nquite late each evening . Our. plans for\nthe session are not entirely finalised, so that you still have a chance to plan our\nfuture.\nAlternative Article Union, bar to open\nSunday lunch tim cs! The Union bar will, as of this\nSundays .That is the news for\nmale dominated bar.\nMr Brendan Clements, who\nruns the bar, said he hoped to\nprovide food at these times. The summer haze clears\nslowly and the leaves that were\ngreen turn to brown, while my\nhair, which was brown, turns to\ngray as the new session staggers towards us ever more\nrapidly. The autumn finds me back\nIn the Union office, now\nwearing my AAD( Academic\nAffairs Officer) hat and\nsurrounded by the new executive. It is amusing to see the good,\nthe bad and the ugly watching\nJen and Pat wln d up the Union\nmachinery ready for the new\nyear. I have just noticed that\nour dear president is at present\nreplaced by a cardboard cut-out\nTeague while the real thing Is\napparently undergoing major\nstructural repairs and redecorating (rumour has it that he is\nhaving a BBC voice transplant).\nEnough of this gay banter, I must get on with Academic\nAffairs before my vocabulary\nIs expended and I am forced to\nresort to tautology -Looking thro* my newly\nacquired files I find that until\nlast year academic affairs\nconsisted of throwing darts at\nnewspaper cuttings of Lord\nMurray or even further back,\nSir Eric Ashby but times are\na changing. My predecessor\nset an unfortunate precedent\nby doing a lot of work and\ngetting AAC recognised as a body which could be useful in\nthe running and structuring of\nCollege academic life. There are two major issues\non the A A files at the moment.\nThe first is an attempt to combat\nfalling student numbers by\nproducing an Alternative\nProspectus. The College\n' glossy' tells everyone how\nmany Nobel prize winners we\nhave as well as useful information like the number of course\nunits carried by the Etruscan Archeology option (very few).\nIt Is hoped that the Union\nproduced prospectus would\ncompliment and not compete\nwith the official prospectus by\nproviding Information on\nac como dati on, how to find flats\nand student opinion of courses. This might dispel many of the\nmyths surrounding IC and\nLondon which exist in the\nminds of many prospective\nstudents. The academic standing of\nthe College Is no longer the\nsole concern of a prospective\nstudent. The possibility of a hall place, the social life and\nthe difficulty of finding\nalternative accommodation, all weigh heavily on such a student's mind. I am sure that\nif we can provide a realistic picture of life at IC this will attract people, not frighten\nthem off as some academic\nstaff seem to fear.\nThe second Issue concerns\nthe expansion and development\nof associated and general\nstudies. At present most\ndepartments only . allow associated studies in the\nthird year - If then.We would\nideally, like to see associated studies available for at least, a half unit per year and\ntimetabled to prevent clashes with departmental courses .\nThis would enable study of a language as part of a degree\ncourse for instance .\nIt is time many departments\nrealised that the sole purpose\nof undergraduate teaching is not\nto produce research students\nand that university education\nshould not be entirely concerned\nwith self perpetuation but also with an education useful to\nthe mse Ives arid s cc let y. Just before I fall out of the\nbottom of my column, may I say\nthat you have academic year\nrepresentatives, a department\nrepresentative and C CU A AO ready and willing to help with\nany problems you may have,\nbut please feel free to see me\nat an v time. Rick Parker, AAO\nterm open during lunch time on regular customers of this once\nThis would consist mainly of\npies and other suitable foods\nwhich could be kept heated in\nthe bar. Residents of Be it Hall requiring a snack lunch on\nSundays will thus not have far\nto go in search of their lunch.\nPrior to this the bar never\nopened on Sundays during\nlunch time.\nThere are also no refectory\nservices available in the Union\non Sundays hence the idea to\nprovide snack lunches in the\nUnion bar.N US Travel NUS Travel will be open from\ntoday and throughout the term\nfrom 1030am till 3 30pm. You can obtain British Rail\nCards from NUS Travel Office\nin the Union Lower Lounge .\nThey cost \u00a35 40. You will\nrequire a passport size photograph and a registration card .\nAlso available is the new\n' STUDENT TRAVELLER' plus details of all winter\nholidays\n\n"

The moon rules one's emotions and inner nature as well as the response, imagination\nand personal habits. However, the positions of the other planets\nand their aspects play just as an important role.\nA person's Sun sign is a reasonable off-the-cuff guess about\nhis general character and traits.

FREE SUPPER& FILMSTRIP on\nThursday October 2nd At6.15 pm\nIn The Union Lower Refectory\nCHESS CLUB The Chess club fresher s evening will be held on\nThursday, 2nd October, at\n6 3 0 pm in the Chess club room, Southside, Princes Gardens. All welcome .\nSTATUS QUO NEVER PLAYED FOLK LIKE THIS! FOLK CONCERT on\nTuesday September 30th at\n7.30 pm\nin\nUnion Senior Common Room\nAdmission Free\nOrganised By IC Christian Union'\nTo all those who have come to the bright lights of the ' big city' to join the thousands of\nfellow students in the lovely suburbia of South Kensington, may I,on behalf of the Students' Union of the Institut Francais( don't tell me you have forgotten all your French already?) wish you a very big welcome. We have all felt the pangs of\nanxiety and trepidation, coupled with the thought of finally cutting the apron strings once and for all to come and live in the great unknown. All I can say is that thousands of others have survived several years here \u2014even enjoying themselves at times( though as several past and present students, both at IC and IF, know, this is not\nto become the general rule!) \u2014\nso why a few thousands should not escapes me. IF( Institut Francais), for those who are new or still unaware of the fact, is a small holding of young ladies(?!) who have decided not to break into the male world of Science and Technology( sorry Germaine), but submit themselves to two years' training to become' bilingual secretaries'. For many years, the image of the' secretary' or\n' personal assistant'( different name for practically the same thing!) was that of a dream girl \u2014 blonde and beautiful, seated on her employer's knee, with only very limited skills( at least, as far as secretarial ones were concerned!). Even today, many people tend to think that girls who become secretaries do so because, frankly, they are incapable of doing anything else. This is far from true in many cases. A secretarial post envelopes various roles, besides the obvious ones such as typing and taking dictation. A secretary is not only the boss' s buffer at all times and during all his moods, good or\nbad, but she is also the backbone of the office and, therefore, to a large extent of the firm. Her work and appearance must be faultless, as must be her with clients, since she is her boss' s envoy. Are you still there?( No \u2014\nEd.) Comeback! Honestly, it is not that bad and if in your case it is, then it is up to you to do something about it. As members of IF Union, we are able to use the facilities a tIC, including the swimming pool, squash courts etc. Whatever your interests \u2014 sport, arts or\nscientific \u2014 there are facilities available for you to follow them. Do so! University life does not cease at5 pm \u2014 nor need yours! The gliding club has just completed one of its most successful summers in its history. Our three gliders have totalled about600 hours between them and there is no end to the list of great things done. Three ex students attained their gold distance and diamond goal( a flight of 3 0 0 Km declared beforehand). The list of\nsilver legs Is endless, a lot of them from students who only started last October. Last year's captain, Nigel Leak, finally completed his silver C badge with a flight to South Cern ey though he did have to live atLas ham for over two months to get used to the idea. Last year's star fresher is no doubt John Chapman. He started training last October, went solo on the Christmas course and has not looked back since. He has now done over60 hours solo, obtained his silver C badge, almost been impounded for\nlanding at Compton Abbas, almost been pounded for running the skylark into the back of my\nand when he attempted to roll the Dart trailer( and my carl!) over one of Her Majesty' s letter boxes we gave up. Pet eVer k roost, who Is doing the favourite IC trick of\nstaying on and on and on, flew the Dart in the La sham Region a Is\ncompetition. He would have done a lot better if he had managed to get round the task op one or two days but he did get plenty of field landing practice!! The tally for the week was one ploughed field, one grass field, an airfield and a short< can. The distances covered \u2014 well perhaps not. The Dart, Skylark and the syndicateD art are, at present, up in Scotland on a fair week expedition attempting some wave flying. We worked furiously on the Dart trailer after the Regional s' episode to get it roadworthy for the trip north only to have Tony Porter, this year's captain no less, attempt to emulate John's catastrophe( fortunately with a less disastrous effect \u2014 there wasn't a letterbox in the way). The Dart was therefore a couple of days late in getting to A boyne. This year promises to be even more successful than last year. At the Fresher s Fair on Tuesday we shall have our early K8 machine in the quad to show budding pundits what a glider looks like. Gliding is the cheapest form of flying and at IC we are sub sidi sed by the Union so that it is within the financial means of all students. We shall betaking parties of\nfresher s down the first two weekends for joyrides and showing you the various facets of gliding. Flying membership for the year costs \u00a3 9 . 5 0 whilst social membership costs50 p. Flying fees are naturally on top of this.

    "content": "mix Peter Patter Welcome all you that have sojourned\nto this establishment of acad eml a in\nsearch of knowledge, truth, and a degree .\nI hope that you all have an enjoyable\nand successful time here in this, one of\nthe true Bastions of science and\ntechnology .\nOne of the problems that many of you\nthat are at University for the first time,\nwill face, is to achieve the correct\nbalance between the time that you spend\non your academic life and social life. At Imperial College there are over eighty\nclubs and societies offering a wide range\nof activities. You may never have had\nthe chance to take-part in some of these\nactivities in the past. I would warn you\nto be careful, and sensible. Do not\n;com m lta great deal of the time which you\nhave to the activities of clubs and\nsocieties until you at least know what\ndemands your academic work is going to\nmake on you. It is easy to over-commit\nyourself when you first get to college, I know. I did. On the other hand, however,\nI would urge you to take part In at least\nsome of the clubs and societies that the\nUnion provides. I feel that you will have\ndefinitely missed out on a very important\nfacet of University Education, if you do\nonly academic work and take no part In\nthe social life of IC .\nWe must remember however, that we\nare the Union...and the Union should\nbe doing those things that we wish it\nto do.\nThe Union plays an integral part In\nlife at IC. We must remember however,\nthat we are the Union. Every student here^\nis automatically a member, and the Union\" should be doing those things that we\nwish It to do. For the Union to do such\nth h ngs it Is important that you all make\nfeelings known. So take part in Union\nGeneral Meetings, talk to your Departmental Representatives, or come to the\nUnion Office and talk to any of the\nOfficers.\n. Accommodation has been causing many\npeople problems over the past few weeks.\nApart from the difficulties In finding\naccommodation In London, there are also' those problems which can arise out of the\nplethora of complex legislation which covers-the accommodation field . The1974 by Peter Teague, ICU President\nRent Act, the question of licences\ninstead of Tenancy Agreements, and Security of Tenure are all difficult\nquestions. If you have any problems over\naccommodation, please come to the\nUnion Office and see either John or\nmyself. We will give you all the help we\ncan. The same holds for other legal\nproblems, grants problems, in fact just\nabout anything.We will always try to find\nthe solutions. It is in the interests of all in College ,\nto have a relatively cheap, good\nquality and convenient catering\nservice on the campus.\nAnother problem of immediate concern\nis that of refectory prices. The refectory\nprices were increased by forty per cent\non September 1st in an attempt to increase\ntakings by a similar amount in order to\ncover a large deficit expected in the\ncoming year. The price increase is, of\ncourse, driving people away from the\nrefectories. Instead, they are bringing\nsandwiches, or eating elsewhere. It is in\nthe interests of all in college to have a relatively cheap, good quality and\nconvenient catering service on the campus. In order to see whether or not this is\npossible, given the constraints placed on\nthe refectories, I hope that the Union will set up a small Working Party to investigate\nif it were conducted correctly. The question of refectories will be discussed at the first Union General Meeting and 1\nhope that ALL of you will come along.... the government is expected to cut\nanother \u00a3520 million from the education\nbudget over the next four years.\nA major feature of the coming year is\ngoing to be the NUS Grants and Cuts Campaign. Following its policy of cutting,\nPublic Expenditure, as a means of\ndealing with the present Economic Crisis, the government is expected to cut\nanother \u00a3520 million from the education\nbudget over the next four years. This follows cuts of \u00a3465 million over the last\ntwo years. These outs mean that next\nyear the expenditure on education will have only increased by 1.6% and with\ninflation running at something over 2 5 %\nthis me.ans that in real terms the education\nbudget has been cut by some 2 3 % . What\neffect will this have?Well with the places\nin Teacher Training Colleges being\nhalved we will soon see a steady increase\nin class sizes in Primary and Secondary\nSchools. The Inner London Education Authority says that it will have to ' lose'\nabout five hundred teachers next year,\nand hopes that It can do this by natural\nwastage. In the Higher Education sector\nthe effects are difficult to estimate. This means that universities are\nhaving to begin 'freezing posts'...\nUniversities usually have about 97% of\ntheir budget committed, on salaries etc., and the room for flexibility in the budget\nis very small. This means that Universities are having to begin 'freezing posts', that\nIs, not replacing staff that leave. How\nquickly this will effect lecturing and\ndemonstrating is hard to tell .The problems\nwhich some institutions face as a result\nof these cuts are very complex. The\npolicy of cutting educational spending Is\nvery short sighted. When the economic\ncrisis is over we will need well educated,\nintelligent people, particularly scientists and engineers, to ensure that the economy\ngets onto its feet again quickly. I hope\nto be able to give you more information\nabout the Education Cuts, and their\neffects in subsequent issues of FELIX and in leaflets distributed around College. We can then decide whether or not we\nwant to take any actions against these\ncuts, and what form any possible action\ncould take. The policy of cutting educational\nspending is very short sighted.\nIn concluding this Peter Patter I just\nwant to say that I hope the Fresher' s Events go off well, and that we all have\na good year. If you have any problems, or\njust want to say hello, Is hall be at\nFresher' s Fair and Fresher'sT ea.I hope\nto see you all then.\nRefectories Motion\nIC Union Notes:\n(i) The Increase in Refectory Prices of forty per cent, which was approved by the Governing Body at its June meeting, and put\ninto effect on 1st September 1 975.\n(ii) That this increase is severe in com parisi on with the\nincrease of twenty-two per cent in the student grant.\n(iii) That Refectory Prices are now to be reviewed termly,\ndespite the fact that the student grant is fixed on an annual basis.\n(iv) That the price increase has not been accompanied by any improvement in the quality of the food served in the refectories,\nwhich ranges from the tolerable to the totally in-edible.\n(V) That the price increase means that many local cafes and\nrestaurants now have comparable prices to those in the refectories,\nand food of a better quality.( vi) That the refectories are run on an entirely be lf balancing\nfinance system, although many other institutions similar to IC\nhave decided that this is impossible in a time of high inflation.\nIC Union Believes:\n(i) That the College, when accepting students, must also accept responsibility to provide reasonable food, at a price which is consistent with the student grant.( ii) That the situation in the refectories at present. Is such\nthat each student should seriously consider whether the food\noffered, for the price which must be paid, makes the refectories\nthe best place to eat. IC Union Instructs:\nThe Executive to investigate alternative places to eat, both in\nand around College, and to urge people to make use of any such\nalternatives.\nThe Union Representatives on Refectory Committee to\ncommunicate the content of this motion to the Refectory Committee\nat the earliest opportunity, and to press strongly for the Refectory\nCommittee to set up an independent inquiry, to find those areas\nin which Improvements and economies are possible within the\ncatering system at Imperial College. Motion proposed by Peter Teague\nSeconded by Riz Shakir\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX A report on the\n4th annual Southern Africa Conference\nThe conference held at Salford\nUniversity on the weekend of the first\nweek in July(46 July 1975) was\nopened by Sue Slipman, the new NUS National Secretary. In a brief speech she\nlaid down the foundations of what was to\nbecome a very interesting and very\ninstructive conference. She was followed\nby Jen McClelland. A AM Field Officer and\nexecutive member .Ms McClelland outlined\nthe tasks which A AM performs.\n\"AAM is basically an information\ndistributor,\" she said. \"Our main job is\nto la is e with organisations who support\nthe Liberation movements in Southern\nAfrica.\" A AM also held seminars and\ncould provide speakers for talks. \"AAM\nis a membership organisation and I would\nask those of you who have not joined\nalready to do so\", she concluded. The introductions were followed by\ntwo films, one being the now famous\n\"Last Grove at Dimbaza\" . The first film\nconcerned Namibia and its liberation\nmovement SWAP O( South West Africa People's Organisation for Namibia). It\nprovided an historical background to the\nstruggles in Namibia and also gave an\ninsight to the activities of SWAP O. SWAP O was not only leading a revolutionary struggle, it was also educating its\nsupporters and members politically in the\nprocess.\nThroughout the conference, members\nof the liberation movement stressed the\nvery high importance they gave to this\naspect of their work.\nBarry Minis low of CFM AG( Committee\nfor Freedom in Mozambique, Angola and\nGuinea) showed slides taken earlier this\nyear in Mozambique. F RE LIMO having led\nthe Mozambiquane to independence were\nstrenuously trying to bring mass lite a cy to the country and so create political\nawareness amongst the mass of the\npopulation. One significant point to\nemerge is that F RE LIMO did not fight to\nend white domination. It fought against a minority group (of whites and blacks) led\nby the white Portugese upper class in\nPortugal who did not have the support of\nthe Portugese working class who were\nm and a tori ly conscripted to fight the\nF RE LIMO guerillas, F RE LIMO have set In motion an\nintensive and radical programme which will bring the country prosperity and\nresult in the establishment of a peoples\nrepublic. The success of their task Is\nregarded as of the utmost importance,\nsince it would set a precedent in the\ntrend in which revolutionary governments\ndevelop, especially in Southern Africa. The second and longest day of the\nconference began with a speech by Joe\nSlovo, a South African barrister, who is\nnow in exile. Mr Slovo is a leading figure\nin the liberation movement of South Africa and defended many political trials. In the\nTreason Trials of 1958-61 he was himself\na defendant.\nIn a speech lasting nearly an hour Mr\nSlovo attacked, vehemently, Mr Vorster's regime saying, \"The institutional is ation of ras c is m in South Africa is what places\napartheid oppression^part from any other\nform of oppression\". He went on. \"The\nview of the moral liber a lists that apartheid\nand white supremacy will die a natural\ndeath has been demonstrably shattered in\nthe last three decades. Industrial progress\nhas forced the apartheid regime to suck\n''in more and more blacks thus giving them\nrights that they would not otherwise\nenjoy ... the increasing dependence of\nthe white colonialists on black sweat and\nskill makes the whites more jealous of\ntheir supremacy and In this context it can\nbe seen that the apartheid regime is\nretreating - no matter how minimal this\nretreat is\". He also attacked the Bantustanisation\nand \" detente\" policies of Vorster\ndeclaring \"Vorster is now fanatically\nseeking to create dialogue and institute a neo-colonialist system by the setting up\nof the Bantu homelands with puppet black\nofficials.\" It is these very homelands\nwhich are now being used as dumping\ngrounds for \" pass laws\" offenders.\n\"Armed struggle is the only way to\nbring down the apartheid regime and to\ncounsel otherwise is to admit submission\"\nhe concluded as delegates rose to give\nhim a thunderous ovation. This view is\nnow the line which the OAU is adopting\nand with there being a real possibility of\na\" black liberation army being set up by\nthem to help achieve this aim.' All the\nspeakers who followed also reiterated\nthis in their speeches. There was no\ndenying the Increased militant attitudes\nof leave rs of the liberation organisations.\nMr Johnson Ndhlovu, ANC( Zimbabwe)\nspoke next on the situation in Zimbabwe\n(Rhodesia) and the events that had taken\nplace up to date. The unity agreement\nreached by the various liberation movements in Zimbabwe led to the formation\nof a joint committee. Its task was to draft\na constitution for the reconstituted ANC( Zimbabwe) and secondly, to draft a programme of the objectives which the\nliberation had to achieve. \"Unfortunately\nit (the committee) failed in this task\" and\nfurther \"attempts to set up a congress to\nformalise the leadership of this body and\nmake them responsible to the peoples also\nfailed\", Mr Ndnlovu said. He went on to say that he believed\nthat F RE LIMO should be compensated for\nany losses Incurred during the fighting.\nThus he welcomed the developed Common wealth nations (Canada, UK, Australia, and NZ) proposal to assist the F RE LIMO government financially as well as\ntechnically. Mls ck Muyongo, acting VP of SWAP O, then took up the case of the liberation\nstruggle in Namibia. He stressed the\nneed to look at the positive approach\nbeing taken in Namibia. \"Do not believe\nall you read in the British press\", he\ncommented. He was also optimistic that\nthe infighting taking place would be\novercome. Namibia' s problems were firstly\nthe presence of South Africa and secondly\nthe foreign investors who wished to\nmaintain the status quo. \"Vorster's pretentious claims to wanting the problem\nof Namibia solved is just a front put on\nin the UN for international recognition of\nhj s \"detente\" policies,\" he said. In his speech he made the point that\nUN were unable to take any constructive\nsteps to try and resolve the problems of\nNamibia. This inability was the result of\nvetoes exercised by Britain, France, and\nUSA in the UN Security Council. However, the UN was a good platform from which\n? WAP O Could receive international\nsupport for its fight to liberate and\nachieve Independence for the peoples of\nNamibia. The only remaining country whose\nproblems had not been spoken of was\nAngola. Barry Munslow, member of the\nCommittee for Freedom in Mozambique,\nAngola and Guinea ( CFM AG), remedied\nthis in an eloquent delivery. Angola\noccupied a unique position in Africa due\nto its richness in natural resources\nincluding oil and gold. This meant that\nhuge amounts of foreign investment\npoured into the country.\nHowever, some of this money was\nalso used to back FN LA( National Front\nfor the Liberation of Angola). FN LA, whose leader Holden Roberts is the\nbrother-in-law of General Mobutu, is\nalso backed by the Zaire government.\nConsequently, many of the FN LA troops\nare Zaire an s and one can only communicate\nwith them in French! UNIT A( National\nUnion for the Total Independence of\nAngola) is the South African backed\nso called liberation organisation. Third, but by no means least, is MPLA( Popular\nMovement for the Liberation of Angola)\nwhich has received communist backing. It represents \" popular democratic power\"\ninvolving nine million Angolans in\nthinking, participating and implementing\nthe government in order to achieve\neconomic and social independence.\nDuma Nokwa, executive member of\nANC( South Africa) and Zola Zembe\njoined the line of distinguished speakers\nat the conference. Mr Nokwa talked at\nlength and wi th emo ti on about Bram Fischer and the indignity and deg red ation he\nsuffered at the hands of the South African regime. Apparently, South Africa want\nhis ashes In prison for fear of ash rime being erected In his honour. Conference\nstood in silence for one minute to pay\ntribute to Bram Fischer. Zola Zembe described the treatment\nmet ted out to himself and fellow prisoners\nin i all its gory det alI. Shocked delegates\nlistened to tales of brutality comparable\nonly with Nazi torture sessions. There\nhad been over 11 million people imprisoned\non \" political charges\" between 1948 and\n1 9 7 5 . His son, we learned, had just been\narrested, beaten up and had his eardrums\nburst.\nIt was against this background that\ndelegates held discussions and eventually\npassed resolutions to support and\ncampaign on the Issue of liberation for\nSouthern Africa. The campaign will be\ncentred around two areas \u2014 solidarity\nand combatting collaboration. The\nsolidarity aspect of the campaign will involve such actions as adoption of\nstudents, sending medical packs to MPLA, SWAP O etc and sponsored walks . Central\nto the campaign as a whole will be NUS liaison with A MM( Antl-Apartheld Movement and work with trade unions at a local level.\nThis, the fourth annual conference and\nattracted the largest number of delegates\never, from the largest number of constituent organisations. The conference\nalso benefited enormously from the\npresence of prominent members of the\nANC( African National Congress) and\nliberation movements such as SWAP O. "

No, this is not a cheap porn movie, it Is a straightforward\nadaptation of the stage musical \"The\nRocky Horror Show\" with book, music\nand lyrics written by Richard O' Brien who\nIncldently plays the part of Riff Raff, a hunch back handy man, In the film. The stage play has been running since\nJanuary 1 9 7 3 , this obviously speaks well for the music. It is \"50's style Rock played with ' 7 0 ' s techniques.

Paul Ekpenyong\nGeorge Thalben Ball Plays the Allen\nComputer Organ at Chichester\nCathedral.\n\"IN A remarkably short time Allen's Digital Computer Organ has won the\nenthusiastic praise of scientists, clergy-men, church and concert musicians the\nworld over.\" So says the album cover and\nI have no reason to doubt it, but having\nmade extensive enquiries, admitted ly only\nat the pub, I have decided that the\nmajority of the populace know nothing of\nthe wondrous machine in question. In my\nignorance al) I can say is that, forcing\ntechnology into music can only be\njustified If it produces new musical\ndevelopment. It should not just be done\nas a scientific exercise to prove technological omnipotence. For example I 've\nheard synthesisers used to excellent\neffect but \"Xour Top Ten Hits on Moog\"\ndoesn't turn me on. I can now reveal that the computer\norgan sounds precisely the same as any\nordinary organ and I couldn't even hear\nthe cards being read or the print out\nspewing forth. The record consists of\neleven church pieces, (including works\nby Roger, Stanely, and CPE Bach), and\nit inspires a diversity of moods.. Indeed\nthis contrast of styles is what spoils the\nrecord because it lacks continuity which\nis especially important for background\nmusic and I would guess that church\nmusic in one's front room is rather an\nesoteric taste, except in a background\ncontext.\nBut perhaps I was disconcerted by the\nvery thought of a computer organ. Will computers now start reproducing? Where\ndid all those pocket calculators come\nfrom?\nAndrew T Osborne\nYvonne Elliman - Rising Sun (RSO)\nThe second solo album by Miss Elliman is hardly likely to win her more\nadmirers than those who got off on her\nprevious effort, and in fact will no doubt\nsucceed in confusing many would-be\nconverts. Although almost faultless in\nterms of production, (Steve Cropper),\nmusicianship and to a large extent\nmaterial, the album doesn't exactly\ncatch you by the proverbial \" short and\ncur lies\". The confusion arises from the fact\nthat this Is a complete departure from the\nwork she is currently engaged in (le the\nrock context of Eric Clapton' s band) and\nis, in fact, so commercial that it could\nalmost fall into the easy \u2014 listening\ncategory (almost sur o at times) \u2014 which is\nfine I suppose, but the fact that in having\na foot in each camp as it were, she ends\nup going nowhere fast.\nPeople who have picked up on her\nsinging rock-blues as part of the ' Eric the\nC outfit, will probably be disappointed\nwith this album. But as previously stated,\nas an out and out commercial record the\nalbum is, well, pretty good. On the whole\nshe has selected her songs with much care\nand thought. The only track that comes\namiss is the bland rendition of the well known \"Walk Right In\", which is in stark\ncontrast to the usually terse arrangements\nof the other music tracks. Particularly\nworthy of mention is the Eagles \"Best Of\nMy Love\", Todd Rundgren's\" Sweeter Memories\" and the Charles/ Danko song\n\"Small Town Talk\", each of which are\nexecuted to their full commercial potential.\nIt will be interesting to hear her next\nalbum and perhaps in so doing, find out\nwhat fork she will take from the musical\ncrossroads she now finds herself.\nStan Getz - Captain Marvel (verve)\nBasically Stan Getz plays Chick Corea'. Five of the ha If-dozen tracks\nIncluded here are Corea compositions,\nmost of them already recorded by the\npianist on his initial Return to Forever\nalbums, they include 'Five Hundred\nMiles High', 'Day Waves' and the title\ntrack, 'Captain Marvel.'\nContinued on page 13\n\n"

Slippery right-winger recently transferred\nfrom third division RCS for an undisclosed one-figure sum. Selfstyled most popular man in the division. Doubts, however, about\nhis tackling ability when up against tough opposition. Occasionally\nloses head and sometimes shoots at own goal. Taking over\ncaptaincy from Trev Phillips who occupied both right and left\nwing positions last year.\nJohn Downs. Fast talking sweeper from Mines. Previous form\nunknown except that he has strong right foot. Owns a chain of\nboutiques in Oldham but doubts about his management potential\nwith his having spent several seasons with non-Teagners, Mines.\nHowever, his lack of a brain does make him the ideal player for\nthis position.\nICU Hon Sec, John Downs\nICU President,\nPete Teague\nRiz Shakir. Imported from abroad to make this a truly international\nsquad.An undoubted improvement on last year's occupant of this\nposition though regular spectators at the All-Stars may not think\nthis is saying to much. Should p 'ay up the centre and may improve\nas the year goes on.\nSteve Brightman. Temperamental, mou s tachi oed wizard of the\ndribble who plays slightly to the left of centre. Wants to be\ncaptain next year and thus follow in the steps of PT. Police record may count against him, however, and also the unfortunate\ntendency to miss vital training sessions.\nICU DP,R iz Shakir\nR CSU President,\nSteve Brightman\nKeith \"Clockwork\" Ahlers. Biggest drunk in the league. Plays\nas far out on the right as possible and sometimes not even on\nthe same pitch as everyone else. Not one of the games greatest\nthinkers and as a result was almost left out of All-Stars plans for\nthis season!\nNick \"BR Special\" Brayshaw. Second biggest drunk in the\nleague .Has supported \"Union Bar\" all his life. May find actually\nplaying difficult.Ambition: to become biggest drunk in the league.\nBamed for Life. After certain un savoury incidents in a night club\nin West Wickham, the FA has no alternative but to ban the\nfollowing players from ever donning an IC shirt again:- R Kill,\nM Kessler and J Mortimer.\nLeft Wing. Position unoccupied this year.\nGuilds President,\nKeith Ahlers Mines President,\nNick Brayshaw\nOpposition\nBrian \"Bites yer legs\" Flowers. This elegant, polo-necked,\nageing maestro knows every trick in the book and needs to be\nwatched all the time. May be less closely marked this year than\nlast.\nVictor \"Cockroach\" Moorey. One of the all-time greats who\nshows no intention of giving up his place, fried or otherwise, to\nany up-and-coming youngster. One of the league's most expensive\nplayers, he has been known to hit hard both in the s to mr ch and in\nthe pocket. Plays in shirt number 40(%).\nChief Groundsman: Carl Seaford. Has unfortunate habit of declaring\npitch unplayable at short notice .However, he allows most people\nthe use of the ground as long as they can prove they're not\nstudents .'Has right attitude and should go far.\nRon \"We'll take 'em to the cleaners\" Parker. (Striker)\nPlays down the left side. This man can be in sc on pi cuo us for 89\nminutes then whom, he strikes and there is very little the\nopposition can do about it. Indeed, there is very little his own\nteam can do about it either and this has led, in the past, to\ndisputes with the manager and to requests for transfer to the other\nside .\nA. Pathy (Midfield dynamo). All-Stars jinx player, this is the man\nwho may just make the difference between the two sides. For as\nlong as these games have been played, his para ly sing influence\non Starts has been a significant factor in deciding the result.\nHowever, more enthusiastic support from the touch lines would\nencourage All-Stars heroes to chase and harry, and keep bim out\nof the game.\nNIGHTLINE EXHIBITION\nAn exhibition is open in Nightline each afternoon 29th September to 3rd October. It is a chance to talk to a volunteer about what happens there or just have a look at\nthe rooms and display of useful information.\nPlease come, we are in the same building as the\nUniversity Accommodation Bureau next door to the swimming\npool at 8 Princes Gardens.\nOf course we are still open every night 6 pm till 9 am or\nyou can phone 581-2468 (int 2458). The first week at\ncollege can be totally confusing and d is orientating. If we\ncan help you put it in perspective or tell you where to go\nfor what you want, please phone or call round. Nightline is\nan informal confidential student problem centre, run by\nstudents with plenty of time to talk.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE RADIO Invite you to their Annual General Meeting\non FRIDAY 10th OCTOBER at 12.45 in\nthe Senior Common Room, Union Building.\nThe election of the officers and managers of the station for\nthe coming year will be hed at this meeting.'Nomination\npapers have been posted outside the IC Radio room in\nSouthside.\nPlease note* that only Full members of the station are\neligible for election, and that only full members may vote.\nDetails of membership may be obtained from The Secretary,\nIC Radio, c/o Union Office, or from the stand at the Fresher's fair at the start of term.'\n\n"

    "content": "4\nCongratulations on being a student at\nlC at the start of another year whether\nyou are a new comer or an exam wounded\nveteran. To Introduce myself; I am Stella\nGodfrey, a third year (aspiring) Physicist and ICWA President for the coming session. I hope to have the opportunity of meeting\nyou in the ICWA lounge at Freshers Fair tomorrow. Representatives from the\nvarious groups within ICWA will be\npresent and refreshments will be provided\nfree of charge.\nICWA is concerned with the welfare\nand social life of the women at College. With regards to welfare, the new post of\nDuputy President has been created\nespecially to cope with the problems\narising, peculiar to women. This year'sDP is Dani Salvador! and she is a second\nyear Physicist as is Alison Halstead the\nICWA Honorary Secretary. They will both\nbe present at the Freshers reception.\nDirectly linked with ICWA welfare\nInvolvement is the Women in Science and\nTechnology Group which began its\nevolution during the last session. The\naims of the group are to explore the\ndifficulties they encounter in so doing.\nMutters\nThis\" Mutters\" will be the longest on\nrecord. I can say that positively. So s it down. take a cup of coffee in the left hand,\nand read on \u2014\nThe first U GM of term will be this\nThursday. As you must known by now, the\nprincipal business will be the Refectories\nissue. Elsewhere in this \" FELIX\", a motion Is worded. Please read, and\nconsider it. If you disagree with all j, or\npart of it, by all means table an amendment.\nHomeless?\nIf you're one of those unlucky enough\nto still be homeless, then, whilst you\nlook for a flat, the Union will be operating\na crash pad scheme where you can at\nleast slumber to the early hours, and have\na wash . If you want to take advantage of\nthis service, which, incidentally is Free\n(gasp!), then come to the Union and get\nyour name on the list. Parking.\nIf you are the proud owner of a motor\nvehicle, then, to park in College, you\nmust also be the proud owner of a mysterious piece of paper known as a\" parking permit\". These will be allocated by a Union Committee on Saturday 4th Oct.,\nand if you want a parking place, then you\nmust fill in, and return, the form available\nfrom the Union Office before that date. If\nyou own a motor cycle, please see Mr\nDawson In Security, Sherfleld Building, and he will issue a permit.\nUnion Handbooks & Publications.\nThree publications, all containing\nincredibly valuable information, that you\ncouldn't possibly afford to do without, are\nnow available; the ICU, UL U& NUS\nhandbooks. To be serious these are of\nsome relevance, especially the ICU one\n(unbiased view, here), which contains\nwelfare & accommodation information, as\nwell as the club lists, etc. Considering,\nthat they're all free, they're excellent\nvalue for money . Please come and take one\nof each of them, from either tie registration\ndesks, or the Union. Registration Cards.\nThis year's ICU Membership Cards\nwill as with NUS Cards, need a passport\nThe group meets during Wednesday lunch\ntime and all members of ICWA are welcome\nto attend, in conjunction with these\nmeetings, lectures by successful women\nscientists are being organised for the\ncoming session. Karen Gadd and other\nmembers of the group will be present at\nthe Freshers reception to tell you more\nabout the agenda for next year.\nICWA has its own sports club captained\nby Anita Tell am from Botany 3 . The\nsports club or ICWSC as it is known has\nenthusiastic rowing, hockey and netball\nteams to name but three. For those who\nwould like to enroll or merely to find out\nmore details about ICWSC, there will be\nthe opportunity of meeting Anita tomorrow\nat Freshers Fair. Socially. ICWA is one of the more\nactive bodies in College organising a dinner, a ball, lunch-parties and more\ngeneral events during the session. The\nfirst of these, the annual Dinner, takes\nplace on Monday, October 6th. After the\ndinner there will be a cabaret and a bar\nextension until 1.00 am. Tickets can be\npurchased (yes! You' ve guessed It) at the\nFreshers Fair or later from myself In\nArising\nphoto, and an author ising stamp. This has\nbeen done because many shopkeepers\nwouldn't take our previous cards as being\nproof of identity (for student reductions,\netc.). The nearest photo booths are at\nWoolworths In High St. Ken., and\nGloucester Road Tube Station, and before\nanyone asks, I'd better explain that when\nthe \" Photo Booth people\" were contacted\nseveral months ago, they said that they\ncouldn't put a temporary booth In the\nUnion until next week; ie. 6th Oct .(utility\ncoefficient - 0 0 3 ) . Anyway, registration\ncards will be stamped in the J CR, on\nMonday, Tuesday and Wednesday this\nweek, and after that (you guessed It) in\nthe Union Office. NUS cards will also be\navailable then. Elections.\nThis place Is plagued with committees,\nnot that, in Itself is bad, its just that it\ninvolves countless elections; and that Is\nnot, per se, a bad thing either, this being\nthe democratic world that we live In. But\nthe crunch comes when half the people\nelected fail their exams! \",To lose one\nCouncil member might be regarded as\nunfortunate, to lose five looks like\ncarelessness\" to misquote a well known\nVictorian Playwright. So here follows a list of those places now vacant. If you\nare Interested In either standing or just\ncurious as to what some of the posts do,\n\"Dome up and see me sometime\" (ugh\nanother quote).\n1. External Affairs Officer;\n2. Student Residence Officer;\n3 . Community Action Group Chairman.4. Welare Off leer;\n5 . Floor Rep;\nExternal Affairs Committee:6a) Publicity Officer;\nb)US K Co-or dina tor;c) Public Relations Officer;\nd) Secretary;\ne) Plus four ordinary members;\n11.

Accommodati on Committee (2 ordinary\nBeit Hall, room 1 2 1 .\nWe have as our Vice President, Lady\nFlowers. As well as being present\n(hopefully!) at the Fresher s Fair tomorrow, Lady Flowers will be holding\nan Informal ' Beer' n' Bangers' tea in 170\nQueen's Gate at 5.30 pm on October 16th. Anyone wishing to attend should contact\neither myself or Jen In the Union Office.\nLady Ann Thome is the women's Senior Tutor and you will be able to\nmeet her tomorrow at the Fair or certainly\nsome time during the coming term.\nAmong the facilities available to ICWA\nmembers is the use of a typewriter and a sewing machine. The ICWA lounge,\nsituated on the first floor of the Union\nBuilding, is where the Freshers reception\nwill be held. The lounge is a common\nroom for use from 9.30 am until 5 3 0 pm.\nIt has coffee facilities and magazines and\nnewspapers are provided.\nFinally,( sigh) I have nothing more to\nsay other than, see you at the Freshers\nFair tomorrow or if not, at the A'nnual Dinner on Monday!\nStella Godfrey\nmembers);\n15. Welfare Committee (2 ordinary\nmembers);\n1 6 . Academic Affairs Committee (3\nordinary members);\n1 7 . Union Haldane Library Committee (4\nordinary members);\n18.

Overseas Students Committee (4\nordinary members).\nThat lot, you may gather,contains\nsome very important posts \u2014 and the\nPGA O has also to be elected! I regard it\nas damaging to the Union that so many\nposts are vacant at the start of term, and\nI intend to raise the problem at Council, and get some action on it \u2014 for more\nexciting details see the \" FELIX\" report on the October 13th. Council Meeting.\nTittle Tattle.\nI'm nearly finished, so award yourselves ten points and another cup of\ncoffee for getting this far. One more point\nwhich I think needs making is that, in the\nUnion office, all members have a very\npowerful focus for information . We have\ninformation about a host of things, from\nthe addresses of legal aid centres (not\nto mention the Unoin solicitor), to direct\nlines with NUS at Ends iei gh Street. I, personally, would be delighted to help\nanyone who is seeking information about\nEnd sleigh, the Rent Act, good local pubs,\nor anything remotely to do with College. Indeed, I intend to run articles on such\ntopics in future editions. So if you need\ninformation, I would hope that one of the\nplaces you' ll come to will be the Union. For example, did you know that BR Travel\nCards are available as from 1st October\nat the cost of \u00a35.40p.( inc. VAT)? Well, never mind. That' s about it for now;\nincidentally, I didn't start this article\nwith a flowery 'Welcome Fresher s' bit\nbecause by the end of the week 8 reckon\nthat you' ll have been welcomed quite\noften enough.\nSee you around,\nJohn\nJohn Downs is the very approachable\nand very witty Honorary Secretary of\nImperial College Union.\n\n"

    "content": "FRESHER S' FAIR\nTOMORROW\nUGM THURSDAY FOUNDED IN 1949 NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNo.395 Monday, 30th September 1975 FREE! Refectory\nprice bombshell\nAny hope that IC students might have entertained about an improved standard of\nliving due to the new level of grant took a severe blow when at the last Governing Body\nmeeting of the 1974/75 session, it was announced that refectory prices were to be\nincreased by 40%. This increase together with the 16% increase in hall rents; 17%% for\nHamlet Gardens; not to mention the increase in the cost of books and stationery are\njust a few of the increases to be met from the \u00a3155 increase over last year's grant of\n\u00a3655.\nThe increase essentially stems from the UGC' s( Univer-s it y Grants Committee's) ruling which requires that\nrefectories and halls of\nresidence be run on a self-balancing basis. The size of\nthe increase was determined in view of a catering deficit of\n\u00a378,000 incurred in the financial year which ended last July. Theoretically, this increase\nwill enable the objective of\nself-balancing to be achieved\nassuming there is no decline\nin the number of customers\nusing the refectories.\nIncreases opposed\nStudent representatives on\nGoverning Body strongly\nopposed the magnitude of the\nincreases. In addition they\nexpressed the view that\ntermly reviews of refectory\nprices and hall rents were\ntotally unacceptable unless\nstudent grants were to be\nsimilarly reviewed.\nWhen asked to comment on\nthe increases and the reasons\nbehind them the Deputy\nPresident, Ri z Shakir said,\"/ cannot foresee the\nrefectories enjoying the same\nlevel of cu s tom, since for the\npoor quality of food, such high\nprices can only be described\nas unreasonable. This will\nmean that a further round of\nincreases will be needed at\nChristmas and a snowballing\neffect will set in. The only\nthing that can result out of this\ncharade, is the downfall of the\npresent catering system and in\nprocess causing a lot of\nhardship to students.\" This view is also endorsed by the\nother members of the ICU Executive. Formal dinners up 60%\nThis is going to hit particularly hard at C CU Freshers Dinners since the\namount allocated to these\ndinners has not increased by any substantial amount. To aggravate an already desperate\nsituation, it appears that these\ndinners will in fact cost up to\n59% more than they did last\nyear. This seems to contradict\nthe Refectory Committee's decision, on June 5th, recommending to the Governing Body that internal formal dinners be\nsubject to an increase of 40%\nwhereas those for outside\norganisations should cost 60%\nmore than previously.\nUGM motion\nA large proportion, of a student's grant is spent on\nfood therefore this will be a matter of great concern to them\nthroughout the coming session. Indeed, a motion expressing\nthis very feeling is being\nbrought to the Union General mee ting be ing he Id on Thursday,\n2nd October in the Great Hall at 1.00 pm. President recovers- SCAB Chairman resigns\nPeter Teague, the Imperial\nCollege Union President, is\nrecovering from an operation he\nunderwent ten days ago. The\noperation was to remove a hernia discovered eai ly last\nJanuary. Pete had been waiting\nsince then to go into hospital\nfor the operation.\nHe will have to take it easy\nfor a few weeks but this will\nnot however, prevent him from\ndelivering his speech at the\nFreshers reception this\nmorning.\nIt was confirmed a few days\nago that Alan Jones, SCAB\nChairman and last year's RCS\nEnts officer had contracted\nglandular fever. It will be at\nleast six weeks before he will\nbe recovered enough to attend\nCollege, In the light of this, he\nhas resigned his post as SCAB\nChairman .\nMo one has taken over in an\nacting capacity as yet, but aS CAB executive meeting \"is\nbeing called to appoint someone to this position. A new\nSCAB Chairman will have to be\nelected at the second Union\nGeneral Meeting of this term\nalong with about 30 other Union\nofficers . The need to elect so\nmany new officers arose due to\nthe fact that several of them\nfailed their exams.\n\" ECONOMIC PHILOSOPHY OF SHEER LUNACY1' Only 14 per cent of all full\ntime students receive the full\ngrant of \u00a3740 Charles Clarke, President of NUS, revealed\nat a press conference given on\nthe 11 th September.\nReferring to the effects of\nthe educational cuts he said, The whole of the education\nsystem is being starved of\nmoney .Massive e duca 'tion cuts\nare forcing all students to\naccept a reduced standard of\neducation and excluding many\nfrom post school education\naltogether\".\nHe urged LEA's to stand\nfirm and opposed the cuts even\nat the risk of becoming\n\"educational Clay Crosses'\".\nThe NUS would be mustering\nall its strength to fight the\ncuts and central to tl nj it campaign will be working\nwith the TUC, especially at a local level. The NUS would also seek\nthe cooperation of parent-teacher associations . A lobby\nof Parliament has been\norganised for Tuesday, 2 1 st October, by the SE region of\nthe TUC which they will mobil is e students for. Also, for one week starting on the\n27th October, 31 Polytechnics will be in occupation as a protest against the cuts in public expenditure.\nMethods of pressuring LEA's included sending delegations\nto meet LEA officials, working\nin alliance with other pressure\ngroups and through the Labour\nmovement. There would also be direct action involving\npicketing and occupying LEA offices .\nHe went on to describe the\ngovernment's economic policy\nas an \"economic philosophy\nof sheer lunacy\". What they\nshould do is to abolish the \u00a36\npay limit, enforce strict price\nand import controls and increase public expenditure.\nHe also cast ridicule on the\nvisits to colleges taking place\nsoon. He saw no point in them\nif no money was being given to\nthe colleges being visited. "

Corea plays with his usual dexterity, never putting a finger\nout of place, yet not really stretching\nhimself to the limits everyone knows he\nis capable of. Which brings us to Getz himself. Well what can one say about his playing that hasn't been said before?\nHis technique is as sure and fluid as ever, his tone clear and full.

    "content": "Rector's welcome to Freshers\nIt gives me great pleasure to welcome\nall Freshers to Imperial College, whether\nthey be undergraduates, postgraduates - or,\nindeed, staff. I look forward to meeting\nmany of you during your stay with us, and\nIn the meantime I wish you every success and happiness.\nGeorge Santayana, philosopher and\nsometime professor at Harvard, once\nwrote: \" The function of dons Is to\nexpound a few classic documents and to\nhand down as large and pleasant a store\nas possible of academic habits, maxims\nand anecdotes.\" I doubt whether many\npresent members of the academic staff of\nImperial College would recognise them-sl eves from .Santayana's description!\nMoreover, the staff are not here to\nlecture AT you, but to learn WITH\nyou.\nAlthough they still try to impart their\nknowledge and experience In as pleasant\na manner as possible, they work much\nharder than may once have been the case to ensure that the courses you have\nchosen to follow are not only intellectually\nsatisfying but are also relevant to your\npresent and future careers. Your work\nwill be supported by some of the most\nup-to-date equipment and methods\navailable to the world. Moreover, the\nstaff are not here to lecture af you, but to\nlearn with you. That, at least, is the ideal\nto which we aspire, even if, through\npressure of numbers and shortage of\nfinance and human frailties, we don't always succeed. Don't expect to be\nspoon-fed, however: you are here to\nlearn, and learning Is not quite the same\nas being taught!\nI have just mentioned shortage of\nfinance. Inflation has hit universities\neven harder than most other sectors of\nthe community because of the way we are\nfinanced. Imperial College Is no except ion,\nneither better off* nor worse than the rest.\nOver the past few years we have had to\npay for un precedent ly high wage rises and\nhave had to face a doubling in fuel and\nfood bills at a time when our Income has\nnot been fully supplemented for the\nInflation over which we have no control.\n...as with Mr Micawber, where we\nhave an annual expenditure in excess\nof income the result is misery,...\nMost British universities are almost\nentirely dependent upon government\nfunds. In our own case only about 1 2 %\nderives from non-government sources,\nand at a time of industrial recession\nthere is little hope of increasing that. We\ndo not have extensive reserves either,\nand what we have are rapidly dwindling\nbecause we have been unwilling to pass\nThe Rector, Sir Brian Flowers\non the full effects of Inflation immediately.\nHowever, as with Mr Micawber, where we\nhave an annual expenditure in excess of\nincome the result is misery, and so we\nmust strive to bring them into equilibrium\nwithout sacrificing our high academic\nstandards.\n..only too well aware of tl jem insufficiency of the present student\nmaintenance grant, and I shall\ncontinue to press publicly for the\nrestoration of its earlier purchasing\npower.\nAlthough severe financial cuts are\nhaving to be applied, all areas of\nexpenditure are therefore being carefully\nstudied to make sure these cuts fall\nwhere they will do least damage. In two\nareas, however, we have little choice\nbecause of government regulations. I refer, of course, to the recent rise in\nrefectory prices and, to a lesser extent,\nin hall fees, where the government insists\nthat halls and refectories shall pay their\nway without subsidy. This means that\nwhen the costs of fuel, food and wages\nrise, prices are forced up too. We shall make every economy we can. and we\nshall welcome your views on how to do better. We are also only too well aware\nof the insufficiency of the present\nstudent maintenance grant, and Is hall continue to press publicly for the\nrestoration of its earlier purchasing power.\nIn the meantime, however, there is no\ndoubt that owing to the Inconsistency of\ngovernment policies students are tx*lng\ncaught between the Scylla of rising prices\nand the Charybdis of a grossly insufficient\ngrant.\nSo not everything is gloomy; we are\nnot yet digging up the croquet lawn to\ngrow soya beans for the refectory!\nWe must also use every responsible\nmeans an dIstress the word\" responsible\"! to urge upon the\ngovernment a fairer treatment of higher\neducation. As far as this College is\nconcerned we have a good case. We\npride ourselves on the later successes of\nour students and on the application of the\nresults of our researches to the practical\nproblems of a complex industrial society. We make great efforts to adapt to current\nneeds and it is for this reason that we\nhope shortly to increase our efforts in\nsuch topical matters as energy studies,\nenvironmental technology and industrial\nhazards. While continuing to maintain the\nhighest standards In scientific work we\nincreasingly try to cater for those of you\nwho wish to pursue careers in business\nor commerce or public administration, by\nproviding joint honours courses which combine a scientific or technological\nsubject with Management Science or\nIndustrial Sociology. And when the\neconomic circumstances are better we\nalso have plans for improving and\nextending the campus, including the\nprovision of more student ac como dati on. I also hope you will contribute to its\nwelfare as you would to your home,\nnot least by playing an active part in\nthe affairs of the Union.\nSo not everything Is gloomy; we are\nnot yet digging up the croquet lawn to\ngrow soya beans for the refectory! I can assure you we shall do all we can to make\nsure your time here both profitable and\npleasant.I hope you will use all facilities of the College to the full; for the time\nbeing it is your home. I also hope you\nwill contribute to Its welfare as you\nwould to your home, not least by playing\nan active part in the affairs of the Union. If I have dwelt rather a lot on finance\nin this article it is only partly because\nof the economic situation. It is no bad\nthing that universities should be forced\nby financial stringency to examine eye ry aspect of their work and even to recon-.\nside r the essential purpose of their\nexistence; we should not be afraid to\nsubject our own institution to scientifi c scrutiny, whether it be the academic\ndepartments, the playing fields, the\nadministration or the union. The end\nresult might even be a more effective\nCollege. RSMU\nfor fun!\nby Nick Brayshaw.\nPresident of Mines Union.\nOn behalf of the Royal School of Mines\nUnion, it is both an honour and a pleasure\nto welcome all the Mining, Geology and\nMetallurgy fresher s to Imperial College and to the RS M. Being the smallest Constituent College\n(by numbers), it is essential that we\nmaintain a high degree of participation to\ncompete with and beat opponents, and it\nis largely up to you, as fresher s, to\nassist by making an effort to play for, or\nsupport the RSM during the coming year.\nIf you do not get the chance during the\nfirst couple of days of term, you will have\nthe opportunity of meeting myself and fellow officers (those who passed their\nexams, anyway) in the very near future at\na Union Meeting (always great fun!), a Nite-Out (even better fun!!) or your Freshers\nDinner (the ultimate!!!)\nAfter the scathing incisions made into\nour Union ranks following last terms exam\nresults, many Union posts are now unfilled\nand so the first job of the new term is\nelections in order to find replacements for\nsome of our dearly - departed colleagues.\nSome of the posts are ideal for fresher s to have a bash at, for example, Publicity officer and Newsletter Editor whilst some\nposts are strictly for \" old lags\", for\nexample, Rugby Captain. During the first few days of term, there\nis always plenty to do, but one event not\nto miss is the \" Annual Freshers Pub Crawl\" on Tuesday, 30th September.\nEntry forms and plastic bags (for those of\na nervous disposition) will be handed out\nat the Mines Freshers Meeting on Mon,\nafternoon or at the Freshers Fair on Tue s. afternoon, with the crawl commencing at\n6.00 pm in the Union Bar. The maces for the best crawlers will be presented on the following Tue s, which\nis the first Union Meeting of the year\n(always good for a laugh!)\n\n"

No doubt many of you are completely\nbewildered, confused and in some cases total yna used off\nby the charade that accompanies the beginning of each new\nsession. I hope that from this issue of FELIX you can\nderive an insight into the running of the Union, its function\nand the way you can take advantage of the facilities it offers.\nOne of the main topics that we should and will be\nfocusing our attention on is the staggering increase in\nHall rents .\"These two things together with the deteriorating\nvalue of the pound have made utter nonsense of the 21.8%\nincrease in students' grants '.'The end result is to further\nlower an already poor standard of living that students have\nto a level approaching destitution.\nThe situation is bad enough if one receives a full grant\nbut recent research by NUS (National Union of Students)\nhas shown that only 14% of all students receive the full\ngrant. Some of the worst hit categories of students include\nthe means tested students who do not receive their parental\ncontribution; married students; self financing or mature\nstudents and postgraduate students .The latter are particularly\nbadly done by, due to the fact that they have to be at\ncollege for almost the full year.'\nThe shortsightedness which the college hierarchy have\nshown on their part, leaves one absolutely cold.\" In my\nview increasing refectory prices is a false economy and it\nfails* to get down to the roots of the problems, that the\ncatering service at IC is now facing.\nIt is about time that students in this college took some\npositive action to ensure that reasonable quality of food is\nmade available at prices they can afford.\nThe news of Alan Jones's illness comes as a blow to\nthose of us who know him well and is magnified by his\nresignation from the post of SCAB( Social Cultural and\nAmusements Board) chairman. He has always been a very\nactive and friendly person; full of ideas and has contributed\ngreatly to the social life of RCSU (Royal College of Science\nUnion) as chairman of RCSU Ents Committee, and would\nhave been an invaluable asset to IC Union.\nI am sure all of you would join me in wishing him a speedy recovery .\nI would also like to welcome back Pete 'league, the ICU\nPresident, on behalf of all IC students after his operation.\nTo those of you who are not familiar with the production\nof what you are now reading, I would like to extend an\n' invitation to come air! visit us at the Freshers Fair,\ntomorrow .When you will Bot only be able to join us in the\nnext issue but will also he \u00abble to buy FELIX T shirts and\nand be able to acquire a FELIX badge free. I look forward\nto seeing you. ^\nNewspaper of Imperial College Union\nEditor\nPaul Ekpenyong FELIX \u00a9 1975\nPublished by the Editor on behalf of the Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board'. Printed offset-litho on the Unfbn premises.\nMany thanks to Gill, Ian, Mike and Riz without whom\nthis issue would have been an impossibility.\nFELIX Office, Imperial College Union, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SVV7 2BB. RIZ LA READ\ntCU Deputy President by Riz Shakir\nA lot of you have probably come from small towns, villages or\nat the most a city of a million inhabitants and you are used\nto secondary schools of a size that in proportion to IC is like a dot\non. the map of Great Britain . So it is only natural for you to feel\na bit lost in this city of over 12 million and an institution of\n4600.\nTeh 01 - 589 5111 ext 1048/1042/3 Inf. 2881\n. You can help to relieve this\nsituation by mixing with those\npeople who are already here\nand talking advantage of such\nopportunities that may arise\nthrough functions organised\nfor. the beginning of the\nsession. In the follow i pg paragraphs\nf.' dI ike to introduce the Freshers\nFair and a few aspects that\nmy job entails .\nAs the name implies this\nparticular event is for your\nbenefit so that you can familiaris e yourself with the\nchoice of clubs and societies which are available to you. However, as has happened on\nmost occassions of this nature\nthere are those people, who\nr misuse it and indeed some\nclubs and societies or should\n11 say, some of their officials, will try to use this as a means\nof extorting money from you, 'the poor defenseless Fresher'. So BEWARE of those black sheep (after all, there are one\nor two in every flock).\nThe warning having been\ngiven I would like to point out\nthat a great many of the clubs are very sincere and would\nonly like you to draw the\nenjoyment from their functions\nas they have done in their\nmembership with the club. The choice of clubs is\nvaried greatly and all the\nvarious tastes and preferences\nare catered for and I am sure\neach and everyone of you will find some sort of social, cultural, athletic or such other\nfield as may interest you in\nthis spectrum of over a100 clubs and societies. Therefore, I'd advice you to\ngo to the Fair, look around, try\nout for a few days what the\nclub has to offer then if it is\nyour cup of tea, join it. The Fair will be held between\n2.00-pm and 5.30 pm tomorrow\nin the Union Building.\nHouse Committee\nThis is a committee which is responsible for the upkeep\nof the Union Building. The\nDeputy President (me) is the\nChairman of this committee and\nas such, I am responsible for\nredecorating and maintaining\ndiscipline within the Union\nBuilding. I am also responsible\nfor its security .\nA massive re decoration programme has been in progress\nduring the vacation. This entailed a total re decoration cf\nsomething approaching half of\nthe Union Building. This has\ncosta great deal of money\nhence I must ask you to take\nas much cafe as possible to\npreserve its present state of\ncleanliness since it will be\nseven years before such a programme can be undertaken.\nI would like to appeal to you\nto refrain from putting posters\non the wa I Is . May I add, as a note of warning, that any club, society, or individual for that\nmatter, found guilty of this\ndisagreeable practice will be\nhe avi ly penal is ed. Notice boards will be\nprovided to meet the needs of\ndisplaying posters to advertise\nsuch events as may require\nthis .\nBookings\nDuring your stay at College the need may arise for you to\nbook a room be it for a twenty-first birthday party, concert, a disco or even lunch parties.\nAll you do is approach me or\nMrs Jen Hardy-Smith in the\nUnion office and we will do\nour best to provide you with the\nnecessary ty pe of room required. By the way, there is no charge\nas such for IC students.\nHowever, a deposit is charged\nwhich is returnable on your \u2022\nleaving the room in a reasonable\ncondition. I have very recently\nmanaged to acquire the usage of\na suitable party room in the\nSherfield Building which will allow you to make a great deal\nmere noise than if you were to\nhave a party in the Beit Quad\narea. To book this room you\nmust approach me personally\nnot less than ten days in\nadvance of the date on which\nthe party is to be held so that\nthe necessary arrangements\ncan be made.\nI hope your stay at Imperial\nCollege is a happy one and\nthat you will not hesitate to\ncome and see me if you\nencounter any problems in\nyour college life. I look\nforward to seeing you all throughout the coming session. COPT DATE: TUESDAY 30TH BEFORE NOON.\nAll articles missing this deadline\nwill be zapped to smithereens.\n\n"

He meandered\nslowly along a seemingly endless, brick-built s*\" house tunnel, and after kneeing an over enthusiastic bus ker in the\ngroin, found himself confronted by a block of luxury flats\nlocally known as Southside.\nBefore he could say Sir Brian Flowers (he is the blok e speaking to you while you read\nthis), he was whisked across to\nthe gleaming new Union office\nin W2 where he met lots of\ninteresting people and learnt\nsome of the many things that he\nwould be getting up to during\nhis three year stay at IC. What did Egbert discover?\nWas it the secret of the Universe? To find out, come to the\nFreshers Union Meeting at\n2 3 0 pm today in Physics lecture theatre 1 . Otherwise,\ndrop into the Union office (along\nthe walkway at the Maths\ndepartment and) or come and\nmeet us in the Union Bar any\nevening.\nHaving deposited his worldly\nbelongings in one of the rooms\nhe hurried round the corner to\nfind his department. Fifteen\never-6ob or lng minutes later he\nstaggered out thinking \" this can't be it\". And then. :and then (re pet i tion for dramatic effect \u2014 failed;\nin the distance he espied a strange looking figure approach^\nin g.As the figure drew closer, J Egbert could see that on top of\na faded RC ST/ shirt was. a gown(!) and above that a top hat with a mouse stuck in the\nrim.

For once, the police in\nKensington and Scotland yard, have been really sweet ... we\ncan have a rag procession and\neven collect on it! So far we\nhave only got one lorry for the\nfloats but I'm absolutely\nconfident that we'll get offers\nof thousands more (hopefully\none or two novelty vehicles\n(and Jez!) will be there).\nThis year we are organising\na lottery.

Tickets should be available at Freshers Fair and on\nthrough the term until Rag Week when the draw will probably be held. Last year Rag collected\n\u00a38,500.
