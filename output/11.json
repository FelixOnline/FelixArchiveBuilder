    "content": "z FELIX PROFILE\u2014 DEREK COOMBER\nDerek came to Imperial College in the far-off\ndays of 1944, and was soon established as a rowing\nman with a vague interest in Physics and a discriminating taste for beer. In this turbulent\nperiod of his youth, when the Union was coming back\nto life after the war, he was an early and active\nmember of the 69 Club. Hone, it is said, was more\nprominent in the party which bore back the stone\nlion that now broods over the Union entrance hall.\nHe rowed in the famous I.C. VIII of 1946, though\nmumps kept him from Henley, and he would have been\nPresident of the R.C.S. in the following session but\nfor the hand of fate and the board of examiners.\nConcerning his time in the Army, I.C.'s man of\ndestiny is strangely reticent. He is wont to smile\ninscrutably, puff his pipe, and smooth the Coomberian coiffure. Pressed, he will admit modestly the\nrapid promotion which carried him to the (local)\nrank of unpaid la no e corporal, but the rest is\neverybody's guess. At least the harsher circumstances ofthe military life have had no discernible\nef feet on his un lugubrious character.\nReturning in 1948, Derek succeeded In confounding the academic opposition, getting a Second,\nand at the end of the year he moved into that\nesoteric region of the R.C.S. devoted to the persecution of fundamental particles. At the same\ntime began his long-delayed presidency of the R.C.S.( and of the '22 Club) and his official association\nwith the irrepressible Dai Nicholas, which now\noperates in a wider sphere. In these hands R.C.S. Union had its ramshackle finances marvellously\nrestored. Moreover it gained the unique distinction of a President who is current shove ha'penny\nchampion of I.C. This final pinnacle of success, the culmination of such a versatile record, can have left few\ndoubts in the minds of Council when they came to\nelect I.C.'s new President. The future will no\ndoubt present its difficulties, (November the fifth approaches), but here one feels is a man who is unlikely to lose touch with student opinion, or fail to interpret it to the remoter seats of power.\nHere, fresher s, is one who will listen to you\nsympathetically at Union meetings (he has to), and\nwho will not spurn the proffered glass should you\napproach him informally in another place. One who\nwill be your guide, philosopher and friend in Union\naffairs; and one whom you should never partner at\nbridge. He is terrible at it.

On Sept. 26,1950 I dispatched from home a nice big box containing most of my earthly possessions and among other things - my rug ger kit. Up to Monday, Oct 9 my box had not arrived and\nas you can imagine, Iwas getting rather worried.\nOn Monday, Oct 9, however, a representative of\nthe B.R. rolled up and proceeded with the delicate\ntask of unloading a baby carriage..\nNow sir, I have never to my knowledge ordered\na pram and to the best of my belief never had cause\nto. Furthermore, I am a batch el or and intend to\nremain so for some years to come. To add to the\nindignity I received a note from Wlllesden Junction\na few days ago stating that:- \"On and from 13 Oct\n'50, storage charges will accrue at the rate of\n1/0| per ton per week \" .\nYours faithfully,\nP.D.

Imagine my chagrin, therefore, when I discovered that\nthe bar was in fact only open from 12.30 to 2 and\n6 to 10.30 p.m. I have made a few enquiries and\nlearn that the hours were curtailed during the war\ndue to staff shortages, but the war finished 5\nyears ago and I notice that there are two barmen.\nSurely the time has come to rectify this error in\nour ways?\nYours etc.,\nThirsty Fresher.\nI.C.

    "content": "FELIX THE SABIN TANKARD\nFrom our Rowing correspondent.\nThe Autumn Tideway Clinker Eights, organised\nby the Vesta Rowing Club, for the Sabin Challenge\nTankard, will be rowed off on Saturday, 21st. October]\nThe race, which is rowed in a clinker built boat is\nfor junior oarsmen, i.e., those who have never won\na race. The I. C.B.C. have always entered a strong\ncrew for this event and on Saturday, will be defending the trophy which they have won for the last two\nyears. The date being so close to the beginning\nof term means that the crew has had little opportunity to train and \"get together\". Nevertheless, they\nare a keen and enthusiastic bunch and should gi yea good account of themselves.\nThe crew is as follows:-D.J. Gardner (bow); D. G. Brook; G. Benson;\nP.E.T. Baylis; A. Caffarey; C.B. Stevens; P. Osborne;\nH. Metcalfe (stroke); D.H. W. Thomas (cox).\n\"Have a Rood row chaps\".\nHOCKEY\nOn the occasion of the first trial, it was\nonly too evident that the summer vacation had taken a heavy toll on stamina. However, after this\nloose ner( or stiffener i), play at the second trial showed an astonishing Improvement.\nFreshers who caught the eye were J. Bennett,\nfullback (who has captained Christ's College, Cambridge), J. Power, a forward of great promise, and\nD. Waterland (from U.C. Cardiff), who showed considerable speed on the right wing.\nA substantial proportion of last year's triumphant sides have escaped the examiners' plough\nand Peter Justesen should lead the club in yet\nanother successful season. Competition for team\nplaces will be very keen; four teams will be in the field for the first time in the history of the\nSOCCER\nThe trials at Harlington sho.ved a considerable\nimprovement in the general standard of play; this,\ncombined with the record number of 80 playing members, suggests that the prospects for the soccer\nseason are extremely good.\nIt is hoped to field5 XI1\ns, the 2nd. and 3rd. XI's having been entered for the University league.\nFor the first time in the history of the club\nmatches will be played on Wednesdays and Saturdays.\nThis will of course entail extra work for the\nclub officials, but as there are two extra pitches\navailable the position has been greatly eased.\nRUGGER\nTwo facts have emerged from the rug ger trials. Firstly, that there is talent amongst many of the\nfresher s. Secondly, that of those fresher s who\nsigned the trials list only fifty per cent turned\nup to play. That, to say the least, does not help\nto build club spirit. From the V.L. trials came word of one Higkin\nof Guilds v/ ho was claimed to be the best fly-half\nthe University had seen for some years, but his\ntriumph was short-lived for he was returned to Rutl ish School after a fortnight at I.C., to do Intermediate Chemistry. \"Brown-bagging\" at high level!!\nBe that as it may, one ray of hope remains.

    "content": "FELIX5 CC On the evening of a singularly felicitous\nFriday the 13th the R.C.S. Freshers gathered for\ntheir annual malt, hops and harangue in the Upper\nDining Hall. The buffet having been cleared they\npatiently, and one believes pl s asura bly, submitted\nto yet a further introduction to the community,\non this occasion disguised as toasts.\nThe toast of the College was proposed by the\nVice-President Tony de Reuck. with an erudition\nwhich would have been unforgivable had it not also\nbeen witty. He lamented that R.C.S. had sprung\nfrom such lowly beginnings in the Royal College of\nChemistry -\"the Back Kitchen of the Physical Dining\nRoom\", and proceeded to exhort the freshmen to seek\na middle way between too close an attendance on\neither bar or laboratory. With tankard in hand\nand tongue in cheek, he recommended them to \"despise\nnot water that the frogs do drink\", but drew gruesome attention to the ills that brown-b agger flesh\nis heir to.\nDean Levy replied in characteristic form with\nan uproar o us parable of the Saturday night he\nbelieved to have been Sunday,for which he was certified as of unsound mind by a learned society caretaker and newspaper boy; from which he drew the\nmoral that a true philosophy of life saves a lot of\ntime and trouble.\nThe \"Hegelian Triads\" which Professor Levy\nhad on an earlier occasion smuggled into an address\nto the freshmen, came in for a gentle parody from\nPresident Peter Haskell, proposing the health of\nthe Freshers. The corners of his triangle were\noccupied by Wine, Women and Song, and by carrying\nout an experiment recorded by Gulliver in Lepute,\nproved that the greatest of these was Wine.\nAs is the custom in our only harem-keeping\nCollege, the freshmen replied through one of the\nfresh we men, Eileen. Delmage, who thanked the Union\nin the shortest and perhaps the best of the evening's speeches - with sincerity and simplicity. And so\nthe company retired to the bar.\nIt probably reflects the gradual reduction\nin the antiquity of our scholars that most of the\nbeer was consumed and the noise produced\nby the \"old hands\" - but there can be no doubt that\neven without alcoholic aid, the freshmen enjoyed them\nselves enormously.\nFLYING SAUCERS\nFlying saucers have been seen in many countries by a large number of reliable witnesses.\nSome of these saucers are reputed to have come from\nMars, others from Russia, ana others still from the\ngiant U.S. navy base in California.\nUp to last Saturday evening, no saucer had yet\nbeen seen in British skies. It is therefore with\nmuch pleasure that I set before the illustrious and\npotentially eminent readers of your paper, the fol lowing facts.\nAt 2230 hours last Saturday evening I witnessed a disk flying at 50,000 ft. over Kensington\nnigh Street, and proceeding in the direction of\nPiccadilly Circus. It was approximately 210 ft. in diameter and 9 ft.6 in., thick at the centre. In\norder to ascertain its angular velocity - for I realised immediately that all my observations would\nbe invaluable to posterity - I attempted to rotate\nmyself at exactly the same speed. This cunning\nmove to reduce the relative angular velocity of the\ndisk to aero did not meet with success. For, as my\nangular velocity in crea oed, the disk appeared to\nrecede and soon all I could see was an abnormally\nlarge number of stars. The crowd who gathered in Kensington High Street showed considerable interest\nand I am very surprised that this momentous inc ident has not so far been reported in the daily\npapers.\nFurther details can be obtained from the President and only member of the Loch Ness and Monster\nClub, c/o Imperial College Union Bar.\nFOOTNOTE.\nThe Astronomer Royal, Sit Harold Spencer Jones,\nsaid at Brighton: \"I am still patiently waiting for\nreports of a flying saucer having landed anywhere.\nIt is significant that most of the reports of flying\nsaucers appear to have emanated from a country where\nmass hysteria is rather prevalent.\"\nAn Appreciation.\nOne of the most remarkable and heartening\nfeatures of I.C. last year was the resuscitation\nof Phoenix; from its former state of highbrow\nstrangulation it has emerged a well written, well\npresented and, best of all, Interesting magazine.\nAt the risk of being accused of mutual back-scratching, it must be said that this can only be\ndue to the efforts of its able Editor, A.V.3. de\nReuck, and his assistants - he seems to have convinced his contributors that in order to get an article in Phoenix it is no longer necessary to lose\nthe readers in a maze of verbosity.\nA quick scan through Phoenix Review immediately gives on the impression that it is well presented and laid out. apart from the rather regrettable placing of two half page advertisements on\npages 6 and 7, which would have been better placed\nwith the other advertisements. The photographs\nare excellent and well chosen for variety; for\nthe benefit of those who were not present, the\ndark patches on the picture of the Battle of the\nSerpentine are not smudges on the negative, but\nsoot, and the character in the water is Marcus\nHull, who had the distinction of being first man\nin.\nA more leisurely perusal reveals all sorts of\ngood reading. The short story is amusing and well\npointed, the articles under the heading Review of\nthe Year are all good - modesty forbids us singling out any particular one for pra i3e and the\nreports of the clubs together form a most comprehensive picture of the year In the Union. It is true that the collection as a whole does not form\na magazine that one would read straight through\nfrom cover to cover, rather does one tend to dip\ninto it, but this does not detract from the fact\nthat nearly all the articles were interesting and\nmany amusing.\nThis was the first Phoenix Review, and the\nidea Is good; let us hope it will become a regular annual feature.\nE.

The\n1926 Morris Cowley Is\na car which will appeal to the more sporting type of owner\nrather than the business man who wishes to arrive on time at the office in Immaculate condition. The model tested\nhas a reasonably good hood that Is easily erected\nIn half an hour; the side windows are quickly detachable with the aid of a tyre lever, although\nthey suffer to some extent from a paucity of cel-lu loi d. In other respects, the 2 door, 4 seat\nbody is well designed; the doors are both on the\nnear side, the front seat Is of the popular bench\ntype, and - a feature that will appeal to the nervous passenger - the front floor board when pressed\ndisengages the clutch.\nEngine. The 4 cylinder side valve engine is rated\nat 11.9 H.P. and incorporates many new features,\nincluding magneto ignition, reciprocating pistons\nand a3 bear lng fully-rotating crankshaft. It\nstarts easily on the handle and is light enough\nfor lady passengers to turn over without distress.\nElectrical Equipment. The starter motor and dynamo\nare combined in a Lucas Dynamotor, and it is believed that It would start the engine if it was\nconnected up. (Do not use redundant prepositions\n- B. J.P.) In other respects, the electrical system is pleasantly free from shocks. The position\nof the ignition switch make3 no difference to the\nrunning of the engine, a feature that should appeal to women drivers.\nChassis. The steering at low speeds is at rifle heavy, but at normal cruising speeds it is light\nand stable, enabling one to drive for satisfactory\nperiods with both hands otherwise engaged. (The\nmodel tested is rapidly learning its own way home\nfrom the Prospect of Whitby). The suspension is a little hard by modern standards but bouncy types\nshould be amply satisfied; the name \"Springless\nWonder\" is not wholly justified.\nThe brakes stop the car quite nicely, but a little patience is required.\nAccessories. The auxiliary equipment Is comprehensive. Tools are kept in a box on the running\nboard, under the rear floor and under the rear\nseat. The portable welding plant, however, has to\nbe tied on the back. The 12 volt battery is carried on the near-side running board, and the spare\nwheel was carried on the off-side until some clot\nstood on it; it is now carried on the rear seat.\nAn effective, albeit toxic, form of heating is provided by air from the engine having free access\nto the front compartment.\nProbably the most pleasing auxiliary is the\nmanually operated klaxon, a truly magnificent device that commands respect even from the old ladies\nof Kensington.\nPerformance Data.\nMaximum Speeds.\n1st gear\n2nd gear\n3rd gear\ng joe edom gt er Correct 1on Chart.

Just after closing time a few weeks\nago George Birkett (Guilds) and Keith Parsons made\nthe ascent, leaving a red lamp burning at the top.\nThey descended gracefully into the arms of two waiting policemen.\nAt Marlborough Street next day they tactfully\nbecame architectural students. Fining them each Is.\nand ordering them to pay 25s. a doctor's fee - the\nmagistrate, Mr. Daniel Hopkin, remarked: \"Well, I suppose it was a change from your normal life. Eow\ngo back to your architectural studies\".\nTHE INSIDE STORY\nby our special Reporter,\nI tracked down George Birkett in the bar and\nlearnt from him the full story of their exploit.\nThe two of them (his friend really i_s an architectural student) decided on the project one evening -before the scaffolding was yet complete - and made\ntheir way to the park with two companions. Leaving\nthem below as oo at hangers, our heroes began to climb\nthe scaffolding. After many vicissitudes (what, one\nwonders, do the mountaineering club know of the\nhazards of night climbing?), they reached the summit and marked their achievement by lighting a road*\nside lamp brought up for the purpose. Their descent\nwas gravitationally uneventful nut they were considerably chagrined to find that in place of their two\nfriends, two policeman awaited them on the ground.\nThe lamp at the summit had presumably attracted the\nlaw and base camp had wisely fled. The law however,\nwas kindly disposed enough to hel;> the two climbers\nover the corrugated iron fence and insisted on\nescorting them to Chelsea Police Station. There the\ndoctor was called. He examined their tongues, and\nasked them to walk in a straight line. His verdict\nwas - drunk. \"And were you?\", I asked George. \"Ho\",\nsaid he, \"I'd only had five pints\". They were\ncharged but were released on 40/- surety, and allowed\nto go home.\nAt the court next day, the doctor's report and\nthe policeman's evidence weighed against them, but\nthe magistrate was sympathetic and.after fining\nthem a nominal sum asked them why they did it. \"To see if it would look better from the top\nthan from the bottom\", they replied.\n\"And what was your verdict?\"\n\"Worse Sir'.\"\n(World copyright).\nCOMkEMORATIOB DAY PROGRAMME\n1.45 p.m. A service in Holy Trinity Church.\n2.30 p.m. Procession leaves Onion Gate.\n3.0. p.m. Commemoration Day Ceremony in University Great Hall, Imperial\nInstitute Road.\n4.30 -7p.m. Conversazione in R.C.S.

One parts while on the Gold Coast, were\nfilled by a particularly vicious brand of beer,\naptly called \"Club\" lager.

Once\nmore the robes of dignity will flutter awhile; till, speech and ceremony over, we shall discard them for\nthe lighter garments of pleasure and explore the\ndelights of the Commemoration Ball.\nThis day is a unique occasion in the I.C. year.\nAs everyone knows, it commemorates the visit of\ntheir Majesties the King and Queen to the College\ncentenary celebrations in 1945; but the present\nform of the celebrations dates only from last year.\nIts success then was a tribute to the organizers\nand students alike, and its success this year equally\nrests on the enthusiasm and support of every one of\nus. It is one of the few days of the year when nobody does any work; when the whole College collects\ntogether and enjoys (or endures) a splash of pomp\nand pageantry; when we remember what is past and\nwhat is in store. It is a sober but nevertheless\nenjoyable day - it is our Great Occasion.\nBut lest it be thought that the strain of so\nmuch sobriety might overcome the weaker among us,\nit should hastily be added that the evening provides\nthe perfect antidote to the day's proceedings. The\nCommemoration Ball, the like of which is rarely\nseen in London, is indeed the high-spot of the\ncelebrations. Here, in white tie or black, surrounded by glamourous partners, we may taste the\npleasures of the table and of the dance - indeed\nthe night offers unlimited scope in the pursuit of\ndiversion. But - we may add - only to those who\nremember in time to get their tickets'.\nmm mo HOPS\nWe note with approval that the I.C. Entertainments\nCommittee have moved speedily from thought to action in an effort to lessen the pandemonium of Saturday night 'hops'. A fortnight ago the Union was\nmore crowded than ever it was last year - even the\nUnion lounge was Invaded by dancers. Last Saturday\nvetting the men by their Union cards and the women\nby - well, we presume simply by limitation of num-ber, the Entertainments Committee enabled those\ninside both to dance and to get near the bar before\nclosing-time.\nA number of people were caught out by the -\"Show your Union card\" rule; one leading member of\na political group was heard denouncing the idea as\n'Closed Shop'; a life member of the Union protested\nthat he'd never been asked for it before and had'nt\ngot one anyway - he stormed off, muttering in his\nbeard. But the principle is sound and the inconvenience slight.\nWe like our dance ourselves, of course, and\nwe like our spot of beer - in fact, we find that a subtle blend of the two are conducive to a state of\npeculiar well-being. And we do not wish to deny\nsuch pleasures to others - least of all to our\nyoung and fair visitors. But something had to be\ndone and it seems that 'first come first served'\nas an extempore measure, was the fairest way out.\nTHE SECOND IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION COM MEMORAT ION BALL AT GROSVEf*\nWILL\n3\nz<2I WEEK\nTHE\nBE THERE\nTODAY p COMMEMORATION AT GROSVENOR HOUSE 1\n3 sIMON DAY ts YOUR LAST II CHANCE FOR A TICKET I 'VW83H ONV VSUS3H3WO WOOMn\u00a58S IHS NOId nA3NO iS j) ODISW*3HiO i. \u00ab\nC&G ENGINEERING SOCIETY\nIn search more of a free meal than of in spi ration, this column drifted into Queenie's on\nThursday. 12th, for the Engineering Society's Freshers' Tea.\nDr. Sparkes, the guest speaker, gave an impassioned appeal to fresher s to live their University lives to the full. The student chairman implied that, although\nonly at the bar could the full life be led to\noverflowing, the Society offer red much. It was\nthe panacea for brain fag and the antidote to departmental specialization. It also ran a free\ntrip round a brewery.\nThe eighty odd fresher s who attended were\nduly impressed by the excellent tea, the serious\nintent of the speakers and the excellent programme of talks and visits.\nFUTURE OF ALBERT\nAround this most noble of London's monuments has sprung up a vast multitude of steel\npoles. From Hyde Park Gate to the Albert Hall,\nthe whole Ruddy Gore is buzzing with rumours as to\nthe explanation. Have the Ministry of Works yi el ded to those misguided Individuals who regard the\nMemorial as a monstrosity, and, rather than incur\nthe cost of demolishing it, decided to hide it for\naver from human eyes? (Better by far that the\nstatue of Albert behind his hall should be hidden.\nthe Godiva-like ladles surrounding Albert\ncause the most acute em barras ment to passing\nstudents. Indeed, some worthies in the queue for\nthe last Prom, felt impelled to clothe one of them\nwith a board bearing the legend \"Closed till5.15 a.m.\")A more likely suggestion, now that a method\nof determining whether a lecturer 5 s dead or not\nhas been discovered, is that a vault is to be\nbuilt to hold the mummified bodies of Emeritus\nprofessors. Let us hope that it is not to be a fortress from which molten lead will be poured on\nthose who attempt to light fireworks on the steps.\nWill it be a but, no! there is already one a short distance down the road. Are flying saucers\nto be launched from this new building? Is it to\nbe a bird sanctuary? A monument to Touchstone?\nAll these suggestions are ridiculously wide of\nthe mark. Our usually unreliable source states\nthat it is to be turned into a telephone kiosk for\nMr. Scott-Fleming.\nPinup i "
