    "content": "The Qur'an and Modern Science\nIntroduction\nRELIGION and SCIENCE have always been considered to be twin sisters by\nIslam and today at a time when science has taken great strides, they still continue\nto be associated. Furthermore, certain scientific data are used for a better\nunderstanding of the Quranic text. In a century where, for many, scientific truth\nhas dealt a deathblow to religious belief, it is precisely the discoveries of science\nthat, in an objective examination of the Islamic Revelation, have highlighted the\nsupernatural character of various aspects of the Revelation.\nDoes the Qur'an contradict established scientific facts ?\nAfter a study which lasted ten years, the famous French physician Maurice\nBucaille addressed the French Academy of Medicine in 1976 and expressed the\ncomplete agreement of the Qur'an and established findings of modern science. He\npresented his study on the existence in the Qur'an of certain statements concerning\nphysiology and reproduction. His reason for doing that was that \"our knowledge of\nthese disciplines is such, that it is impossible to explain how a text produce\ntime of the Qur'an could have contained ideas that have only been dis\nmodern times\".\nDecades later a noted embryologist Keith L. Moore and expert in his field, upon\nbeing presented with the statements made in the Qur'an regarding the stages of the\nformation of the embryo from the mixing of the male and female gametes up to the\nembryo's full development remarked \"It has been a pleasure for me to help clar i statements in the Qur'an about Human Development. It is clear to me tha\nstatements must have come to Muhammad from God or Allah because alm\nof this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later.\" P Moore presented his findings to scientists at several conferences. Several\nCanadian periodicals published many of Moore's statements and in addition he\npresented three television programmes in which he highlighted the compatibility\nof modern science with what has been revealed in the Qur'an 1400 years ago.\nConsequently, he was asked: \"Does this mean that you believe that the Qur'\nthe word of God T to which he replied \"Ifind no difficulty in accepting this.\"\nIn fact Professor Moore was so amazed at the accuracy of the descriptions and the\nterminology used for the various stages of the development of the embryo that he\n\n"

Ah, 'tis\nmusic to the ears, which is\nmore than can be said for\nthe cacophonous drivel\nthat spewed out of\nNorway for the preceding\ntwo hours. For much the\nsame way that people watch ballroom dancing, I sat through the whole of the Eurovision Song\nContest last Saturday, purely for the sake of this\ncolumn, you understand. It is difficult to select\nthe high/low light of the evening, but the funniest comment came from Morten Harket, who\nsaid that some people refer to the said contest as\na 'European championship of culture through\nmusic' Now I can't speak for the rest of Europe,\nbut I think you're overselling it ever so slightly.\n'Shoopy doo', the Icelandic entry was not exactly the zenith of twentieth century culture, and\nthe Belgium and Dutch entries, pop pickers, presumably written in 1976, had the same first line\n(Nah-Nah-Nah etc.) I hate to sound superior,\nbut to group the UK with such cultural pygmies\nis like comparing the Batde of the Somme with\nsix year girls playing British Bulldog. Thinking\nabout it, the highlight of the evening was the\nincomparable Terry Wogan, whose wit and\ndownright sarcasm was priceless. Keep this up\nTel and you can chum any old rubbish the rest of\nthe year. Good work fella! As for the chances of\nthe beef ban being lifted after Mr Wogan's com-ment s: don't hold your breath.\nComputers are undoubtedly a marvel of the\nmodem age. This is being written on one for a start, and the list of possible uses is endless; who\nhasn't used a spreadsheet to fiddle experimental\ndata, for example? The Internet is also useful,\ncontaining all manner of resources. I am even\nconsidering selling my pigeons and using e mail.\nBut I have noticed a worrying side effect of this\nnew-f angled technology of late. We seem to be\nbreeding a class of people who are so absorbed in\nThe Net that seem unable to interact normally\nwith the rest of society. Enough of this beating\nabout the bush. I am sick and tired of desperately sad, socially dysfunctional morons clogging up\ncomputer rooms for the sole purpose of e mail-ing people on the oda er side of the same room\nand playing MUGs (multi-user games, and probably the most apt acronym I 've seen in a long\nwhile.) What is wrong with you? Some of these\ncharacters sit glued to the screen for hours on\nend, occasionally uttering the odd neurotic\nlaugh, typing out complete jibberish to their\n'friends'. Worse still is live e mailing, where people sit and have 'conversations' via the internet.\nFor God's sake, get a life. Many mountaineers\nlegitimately say their reason for climbing a peak\nis he cause it's there.' This seems to be the justification for their activities. As well as tying up\nmachines needed by people who need them for\nmore useful pursuits, they are depriving themselves of a normal upbringing. I have absolutely\nnothing against the use of\ncomputers, but simply playing on them in such antisocial manner for no real reason is pathetic. If that's your\nidea of time well spent, you\nshould become a traffic\nwarden.\nId are say that most\nof you will have seen the\nplans for the new gallery at the V&A that\nresemble a pile of discarded biscuit tins.\nDesigned by a Polish architect, who clearly had a troubled childhood, it will have the delightful\nname of 'the Boilerhouse'. The only possible justification for such an outrageously ridiculous\ndesign is to make the front Mech Eng look palatable by comparison. The irony is that this plan\ncomes at a time when the College is formulating\nplans to smarten up this shabby facade, and as\nmy good friend will Ian Caldwell will tell you,\nthe V&A face a hell of a job getting planning\npermission for it; the BMS has diving beauty by\ncomparison and it took ages to get approval. I have little time for the work of modem architects in general, save for a few notable exceptions, such as Stansted Airport, after witnessing\nthe mess that was left after the sixties. By all\nmeans produce radical new designs, but not for\nthe sake of promoting either a man, material or\nphilosophy. The constant desire for change for its\nown sake inevitably results in stupid monstrosities such as this planned extension, and to provide public money for it would be scandalous. I suppose I could sign this 'disgusted of Tunbridge\nWells', but as they say in Yorkshire, I don't know\nmuch about architecture, but I know what I like.\nSpeaking of IC Estates (that makes a change\nfor me, doesn't it children?), I have to apologise\nfor constantly calling in to question the ability of\nthis esteemed department. Yes, you take a simple job and stretch it to ten times longer than it\nshould take, and yes, you have a passion for signs that borders on fetishism, but by comparison\nwith the clowns in charge of the British Library\nproject, you are brilliant and without peer. Not\nonly does it look like an out of town branch of\nTesco's, and contain only seventeen more seats\nthan the old building, but it is several years late,\nhundreds of millions over budget and so riddled\nwith errors, problems and cock ups that it may\nnever open. That won't happen with the BMS,\nwill it now?\nRegular readers will know that I have a thing\nabout Anthea Turner. Not that sort of thing, dear\nme, no. She used to generate unsafe levels of\nhate with my calm and angelic mind. And then,\nas if by magic, she left the Lottery to be replaced\nby the brilliant Bob Monkhouse, who should\nhave been doing it from the start. I thought I would wait a week or two to see if her absence,\nas I predicted, would lead to me winning the odd\nten ner. Did it? What do you think?\n\n"

    "content": "TWO . FELIX FRIDAY MAY 24TH1996 NEWS\nKarrian leaves ULU to\nbecome Labour spin doctor BY RACHEL WALTERS\nThe President of the University\nof London Union (ULU) has\ndecided to give up his job this\nweek.\nGhassan Karrian will take up\na full-time post next Tuesday as\nSenior General Election\nCampaigns coordinator in the\nWest London area for the Labour\nParty. Although Mr Karrian will\nno longer be paid by UL U, he has\nnot resigned, nor been ousted,\nand will keep his official title as\nPresident.\nMr Karrian leaves his position in almost as much controversy as when he started. He was\nelected to his position last year\namid allegations that he took on\nthe position merely to further his\npolitical career. Sources at UL U suggest that there is a large\ndegree of ill-feeling amongst his\nstaff and colleagues, and\nincredulity that he should leave\nso suddenly.\nThe position will leave UL U without a President until Sarah\nWhite, ICU President, takes\nover in August. Although Sarah\nhas known of the decision for a fortnight, Ghassan only informed\nhis UL U colleagues this week.\nTara Jefferson, UL U Vice\nPresident with responsibility for\nunion finances, will take over the\nrunning of many of the day-to-day issues.\nA result of Mr Karrian's departure will be the lack of the\ncustomary Sabbatical 'handover'\nperiod. Usually, incoming and\noutgoing sabbaticals share a period in office so that the\nincoming sabbatical can be\n'shown the ropes'. Mr Karrian's absence will deprive Sarah of this\ntraining which she would have\nreceived for her Presidential\nresponsibilities.\n\"I just don't understand\nhim,\" exclaimed Miss White.\nShe felt that the positive relationship that she had enjoyed\nwith her predecessor had\nsuffered. \"I'm cross, because we\nwere getting on quite well.\"\nMeanwhile, Sarah has been\nattempting to salvage some form\nof handover before Ghassan\nleaves. She has been trying to fit\nin as many meetings and introductions as possible with\nUniversity of London staff this\nweek.\nScience Museum gets\n\u00a323 million lottery award\nBY ANDREW TSENG\n\"Albertopolis is happening piece-meal\", commented Ian Caldwell,\nImperial College Director of\nEstates, on the announcement\nthat the Science Museum is to\nreceive \u00a323 million of National\nLottery Money. Monday's grant\nwas the first major award of\nLottery money to go to the\nsciences.\nThe money will be used as\npart of a new \u00a344 million wing\ndevoted to contemporary\nscience, technology and medi-cine. Due to open in 2000, the\nWellcome Wing will include four\nfloors of new exhibition space\nand the first 3D IMAX film\ntheatre in London.\nThe award comes almost a year after the Albertopolis\nproposal was thrown out by the\nMillenium Commission. The\nproposal would have created a huge pedestrian precinct and\nunderground shopping mall\naround the South Kensington\narea.\nComing after last week's grant of \u00a340 million to the Royal\nAlbert Hall, the award provides\nincreasing evidence that the\nspirit of Albertopolis, the rejuvenation of the South Kensington\narea is taking place without a Millenium grant.\nMr Caldwell was upbeat\nabout the Science Museum\nmoney. Speaking to Felix, he\nsuggested that if anything,\nImperial's chances of getting\nlottery funding would be\nenhanced by the award. Imperial\nis about to embark on two\nprojects that could be considered\nfor grants: the addition of two\nfloors to the library and the\nextension of the Sports Centre.\nIn a related development, a new South Kensington coordination group is to be created. The\ngroup, containing representatives\nfrom Imperial College, the Royal\nAlbert Hall and the Museums,\nwill enable South Kensington\ninstitutions to work more effectively together. Its formation\nfollows the discovery that plans\nto excavate the Royal Albert\nHall's steps were due to start on\nthe same day that the\nDepartment of Biology was to\nmove out of the Beit Building.\nThe group meets for the first\ntime today.\nTerry Briley retires from Security\nBY THE NEWS TEAM\nThe outgoing deputy head of\nsecurity Terry Briley, and his\nwife Joy, were given a farewell\nsend off at Imperial College\nUnion on Monday. Mr Bnley\nretired from his position earlier\nthis year after taking some time\noff work through ill-health.\nOriginally from Cork, Terry\nhad served in the police force\nuntil taking up the position of\nDeputy head of Security in\n1986. Reknowned for his\nsubstantial repartee of police\nanecdotes and fiercely proud of\nhis Irish heritage, Terry had been\npopular with staff and students\nalike.\nReminiscing about his time\nhere, and paying particular tribute to Security Guard Vic\nTurner, who died last week, he\nspoke of his commit t ment to\n'looking after' IC undergraduates.\" I will always say that\nImperial should be here for the\nstudents, and they were my first\npriority,\" he said. \"Perhaps I didn't do as much admin as\neveryone would have liked, but I never thought that it was imp or tant.\"\nHis en thus i a tic service to IC\nwas paid tribute to by members\nof ICU, the College Press Office,\nand also by PC Clive Coleman,\nwho came representing Kensington and Chelsea constabulary.\nMr Briley has asked Felix to\npass on his thanks to all who\norganised the event.

    "content": "Carlo Massarella reports on the colourful condition\nreceiving scientific attention. >in\nTHE COLOUR OF MONDAY W hat makes artists interpret moods, feelings, emotions and\nopinions in the way that they do? What enables them to\nconvert ideas born of their minds into works of art, whether\npainted on canvas, sculpted from stone or written as a musical score? The\nbusiness of art criticism would have an untrained consumer believe that\nthere is a right and wrong way in which to go about creating a work of\nart. But interpretation is a genuinely personal affair. Grounds for both art\ncreation and art criticism rest upon the same thin layer of concrete tes-timon y. But artists, musicians and writers who have synaesthesia can call\nto hand scientific evidence to support their personal renditions. For a 'crossing of senses' adds an extra dimension to their lives.\nSynaesthesia (from the Greek syn (union) a is these s( sensation)) is a condition affecting 1 in every 2,000 people. It does not impair their daily\nlives, if anything, it makes them more colourful - literally. For syn aesthetics have the ability to make colour assimilation s in anything from\nmonths of the year to types of pain. Some effectively hear words, numbers and letters in colour. Other syn aesthetics on hearing a particular\ntone or smelling a certain aroma experience it as a specific colour. People\nwith the condition have talked explicitly of how they even dream in\ncolour.\nSynaesthesia has been known to exist for over 300 years, but until\nrecently, little scientific research could offer a worthy insight into the\ncondition and its effects. Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge\nUniversity's Psychological department has led the British arm of research\ninto Synaesthesia since 1986. One of his earlier case studies was that of\n76 year-old Elizabeth Stewart-Jones, a professional painter who trained\nat the Chelsea School of Art in London. Describing herself as 'an artist\nwho has experienced a life-long condition of hearing words and sounds\nin colour', she wanted to discover more about her bizarre talent, allowing Baron-Cohen to investigate the phenomenon.\nThe authenticity of a patient's Synaesthesia is tested in relation to a control group of non-syn aesthetics. In tests, they are asked to describe\nthe colour evoked by a set of words. Their ability to recite the matching\ncolours and words months later is then assessed. 100% of Stewart-Jones'\nresponses were accurate compared to 17% for the control group.\nOn hearing words, Elizabeth experienced a colour forming instantaneously inside her head. Each word evoked its own unique colour and\ntexture, independent of the letters and sounds contained within the\nword. For instance, she envisaged 'Moscow' as being darkish grey, with\nspinach-green and pale blue in places; 'Fear' was mottled light grey, with\na touch of soft green and purple; and the name 'Daniel' was depicted as\nbeing deep purple, blue and red and was shiny. Stewart-Jones talked of\nthe letters 'H','U and 'R' being dark red, yellow and dark green respectively, with the letters of the alphabet conforming to a distinct layout\ninside her head. She pictured the colours associated with the days of the\nweek ordered in a clockwise sense, with the months ofthe year arranged\nin an anti-clockwise pattern. Numbers had their own distinct colours,\nand were arranged in a sequence similar to that ofthe letters ofthe alpha-bet. The numbers 0 to 10 had an individual association with specific\ncolours, with numbers greater than ten evoking a combination of the\ncolours of the individual digits. Elizabeth also related colours to different\npitches of voice; female voices were anchored in a blue spectrum with\nhigh pitch at the light blue end of the scale and low pitch residing in the\ndark blue region.\nSimon Baron-Cohen currently has over 600 Synaesthetics on\nrecord, who approached him after hearing of his work through the\nmedia. \"Wiat struck us was how similar the accounts \u2022\nwere\", he claims. \"Synaesthetics recounted that they \"^j^ Picture: A painting by Elizabeth Stewart-Jones of the colours she experiences on\nhearing the name Alan Ayckbourne'\nbecame aware they had the condition from at least the age of four, and\nall recall a day when they discovered that it was not a sensation experienced by everyone. Following this discovery, most do not dare mention\nit again for fear of being laughed at.\"\nBaron-Cohen conducted a larger study of the phenomenon in 1993\nwhilst at the Institute of Psychiatry in London to investigate if syn aesthetics matched colours with words and letters differently, and what\ndetermined the word-colour affiliation. Colours for individual words and\nletters varied quite substantially amongst the nine patients. However,\nhere it appeared that the first letter of each word heavily influenced the\noverall colour the word aroused, with colours for single letters echoing\nthe colours attached to words beginning with that letter. Eight out of the\nnine involved in the study interpreted the vowel T as being white to pale\ngrey, 'u' as being yellow to light brown and 'o' as white - the latter example being consistent with historical interpretations.\nOf the 600 cases Baron-Cohen has on file, the majority are female.\nIn the 1993 study, researchers found that all relations to syn aesthetics who also experienced the phenomenon were either mothers or sisters.\nCurrent research is centred around these findings, with the blood of\nsyn aesthetics being tested to determine whether or not Synaesthesia is a sex-linked genetic condition. Evidence suggests an explanation for the\ncondition has its roots firmly entrenched in the human brain. Opinion is\ncurrently divided however over which specific regions of the brain may\nhold the key to unravelling the mystery surrounding the condition.\nThe current model of the brain is one composed of a number of different processing regions - different regions process different forms of\ninformation. So information regarding each of the senses (vision, hearing,\ntouch, smell and taste) is processed in its own distinct domain, with\nneural pathways in the cortex (the outer layer of the brain) carrying the\ninformation to the relevant department. Some researchers believe stray\npathways between such regions may account for people experiencing a colour when they hear a sound, claiming we may all be bom with some\nsuch connections, but that they disintegrate as we grow older. Research\ncarried out in Toronto shows that kittens are prone to having such 'sense\ncross-wiring' which recedes as the animal develops. A recent study by\nBaron-Cohen monitoring the brain activity of syn aesthetics concluded\nthat the apparent crossing of senses could indeed be the result of some\nsort of 'integration' occurring between the two regions of sensory processing involved. Others claim a radically new model of the human brain\nis required, highlighting the processes of the limb ic system (a network of\ncommunication pathways situated beneath the cortex concerned with\nbasic information regarding emotions, hunger and sex), and an altogether more 'integrated' model of the brains functioning.\n\n"

'\n- A,',: \u2022: :\n.Iff\n\u2022film: primal fear spooky With such a meaningless title it is hard to know\nwhat to expect from Primal Fear, although the\nfilm does its best to give the game away. Richard\nGere plays Martin Vail, a hotshot defence lawyer\nwho cares more about winning than the tm th. His beliefs are tested when he elects himself\nto defend Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young man accused of the brutal murder of the\nlocal Bishop. Despite the fact that Aaron is an\naltar boy who lived with the Bishop and was\ncaught running from the scene covered in blood,\nVail believes him to be innocent. But deeper\ninvestigation into the Bishop's life reveals both a high-profile property deal gone bad and a tendency toward sexual perversion.\nThe director is better known\nfor his work on various Steven\nBochco TV shows, a fact which is\nclearly evident. The film comes\nover more like an extended episode\nof NYPD Blue (with a healthy dose\nof LA Law) than a major motion\npicture. Consequently, there are a lot of fairly irrelevant minor characters, several obvious plot give-aways,\nunoriginal character is at ions and\nminimal camera work. There is also\na journalist who keeps popping up,\napparently only to try to add some\ndepth to Richard Gere's character,\nbut these scenes always seem artificial and prove to be more a source\nof irritation.\nThe plot is something of a mess: it is too scattered, with too\nmany angles which it fails to combine adequately. What is especially\nhard to comprehend is why Vail\nshould suddenly undergo such a major character change, to care so\nmuch about Aaron's innocence.\nThe split personalities plot device\nhas been used to better effect before, notably in\nHitchcock's Psycho, although it does have an\noriginal final twist.\nRichard Gere is basically playing his usual\nrole and is never really called upon to act.\nHowever, the best thing about this film is newcomer Norton's performances as a troubled simple youth. Laura linne y also makes a step up\nfrom the travesty that was Congo, as Vail's ex-partner and ex-lover who also happens to be the\nprosecuting attorney.\nPrimal Fear is not the 'compelling blend of\ncourtroom drama, suspense thriller and psychological study' that it claims to be, but rather a baffling combination of ill-scripting, poor character-is ation and TV direction.\nfilm: mr holland's opus\njenny ho\nMr. Holland's Opus covers thirty years in the life\nof Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss), whose\ndream is to become a famous composer. The\nfilm begins in 1965 when Glenn becomes a high\nschool music appreciation teacher in order to pay\nthe bills, and in the hope that the job will give\nhim time to work on the opus he is composing.\nGlenn gains popularity with his pupils by teaching them through rock V roll, but disapproval\nfrom uptight Vice-Principal Wolters (an amusing\nturn from WH. Macy).\nGlenn's initial intention is eventually to give\nup the teaching job so that he can concentrate on\nhis composition but this becomes impossible\nwhen his wife Iris (Glenne Headley, an actress\nwith a very irritating voice) announces that she is\npregnant. Glenn attempts to induce an innate\nlove for music in his unborn son by playing it to\nhim through headphones pressed against his\nwife's swollen belly, but his efforts are in vain\nbecause their son is bom deaf. Glenn's sadness\nand diss appointment are made all too clear\nwhen, during a lesson about Beethoven, he is\nasked: If Beethoven was deaf, how did he know\nwhat the notes were? Glenn's eyes start to water\nand his voice cracks as he replies: \"Because\nBeethoven was not bom deaf\".\nMr. Holland's Opus deservedly earned a best actor Oscar nomination for Richard\nDreyfuss, who manages to inject humour into\nhis role and convey an infectious enjoyment in\nhis teaching and conduction. He also ages quite\nconvincingly over the thirty year period.\nMr. Holland's Opus is an engaging film from\nthe man who also directed Bill and Ted's ExcellentAdventure and Critters and has an en\ning that is rousing enough to leave the audience\nsmiling or fighting back the tears, or both.\n\n"

    "content": "This is clear proof of the lack of dependence upon dogma, superstition and\npersonal experience. Rather, it is an indication of the obligation to research,\nascertain and to verify in a scientific manner the credibility of religious (Islamic)\nbelief. Fortunately there are those who have done exactly that like Keith Moore\nand his scientific colleagues but there are others who have invented lies and\nslanders in order to discredit the Qur'an and the Prophet. However when these lies\nand slanders are put to the test scientifically they fail miserably and their\nirrationality and bias becomes evident. Some of the common claims are that\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) was possessed or was an eloquent poet, or a magician, or brainwashed, or even a soothsayer. In fact all of these have been\ndenied and rebutted in the Qur'an itself in numerous places and numerous times. It\nis even more strange that these were the very same claims made by the people who\nbelied the Prophet during his lifetime, and they are the only ones that are resorted\nto today. What a great advancement!\nNay! We hurl the Truth against falsehood and it does smash it's brains and\nthus it perishes.

This purpose ties it with the purpose of\ntissues, organs, systems and the whole body. Thus, there is infinite wisdom in\neach part which makes up the whole. It follows, therefore, that man was created\nfor a purpose and wisdom not realised by those who think that they exist aimlessly.\nWhat is the Qur'an\nThe Qur'an is the sacred book of the Muslims. It is the last book of guidance from\nAllah, sent down to Muhammad (peace be upon him) through the angel Jibraeel\n(Gabriel). Every word of it is the word of Allah.

    "content": "FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY 24TH MAY 1 9 9 6 . FIVE\nst f/?/ jg //'me u o a^ ns^v Nooman Haque explores the cultural significance of Science Fiction films.\nRoswell will be assured its place in history after an\ninebriated cameraman ran amok in a tailor's dummy factory. The hoax will also be remembered for creating the first mass interest 'public'\nconspiracy theory.\nExactly thirty years later, two educated proponents of the cine graphic art, with bigger budgets,\nsteadier cameras and colour film, created two of\nthe most influential films to bear the classification\n'science fiction' ever seen. Beyond mere entertain-ment, both serve very different purposes, with the\nlegacy of Spielberg's film, Close Encounters ol the\nThird Kind, manifesting itself more deeply than we\nperhaps acknowledge. One would have expected\nGeorge Lucas's first film, THX 7 7 38, to have had\na greater influence on his career than simply ending up as number plate in American Graffiti. The\nold fashioned tale of adventure that is Star Wars,\nwith a Princess, a rogue and a bad\nman in black, would appear at first\nto contain no message deeper than\nthe inane muttering s of Alec\nGuinness. Its fairy-tale credentials\nwere further strengthened by the\nfamous opening words, \"A long time\nago in a galaxy far far away...\"\nwhich are nothing more than a modern proxy for, \"Once upon a time in\na far off land...\" Even starting with\nepisode IV was seen by cynics as cinematic fertility treatment - paving the\nway for commercial spawn in the\nevent of the first films' success\nDespite the assertion that the film\nis a modern fairy tale, the good-evil\nbattle at the heart of the trilogy is\nquite complex. The evil is represented by a massive (official) Empire, whilst the good guys are\nrebel guerrillas. Even a rogue smuggler is turned\nby rebel forces. Resistance to the Dark Lord's coercive attempts can only be overcome through use\nof the mysterious 'Force'. The religious and psychological overtones may have gone over the\nhead of the target audience, but they are part of\nthe Star Wars films' alluring appeal.\nClose Encounters is more sinister but develops\nthe good-evil battle and rebel-as-a hero idea fur-ther. It deserves the label 'science fiction' or perhaps 'science faction' more than the Lucas film\nmainly because of its claim to 'reality'. Of course\nneither film was the first of their genre. UFO stories in particular had seen huge growth in the\nimmediate post-war era, when they were\nmetaphors for the real Communist threat. Invasion\nof the Body Snatchers and its kin were Hollywood's attempt to drive the fear of the 'Red under the bed'\nhome to a loyal and morally upright public. The\nAlien was the perfect symbol: unseen, living\namongst us perhaps and threatening to destroy a valued way of life.\nEncounters differed significantly from these\nearly classics however. In many ways it followed\nSpielberg's earlier smash, Jaws, a film released in\nthe fallout of the Watergate scandal and the failure of the Vietnam campaign, and recognised as\na metaphorical snapshot of that period in US his-tory. The hostility towards government of the generation that Spielberg and Lucas came from was a catalyst that eventually redefined the relationship\nof ruler and ruled. Jaws recast the hero as a maverick police official battling against the commercial concerns of a corrupt mayor. Encounters took\nthis one step further and overtly cast the government and military as evil forces and aliens as\ngood guys. The role reversal from the McCarthyist\nera was complete. Governments could no longer\nrely on the unquestioning obedience of its citizens,\nand a painful separation process was beginning\nas people found the power to question and doubt\ntheir government. It was a wholly significant mes-sage, as thousands of veterans were returning\nhome to find that their people and Government\nhad deserted them after they had committed their\nlives to the Government's overseas campaigns.\nThe presupposition that the morals of the state\nwere synchronous with the individual were blown\napart. Heroes could make judgments of right and\nwrong on their own, especially now that the\nmorals of individual and state were divorced. The\ntruth, as Richard Dreyfuss sensed, was out there. It\nwasn't anthrax that killed the cattle and sheep in\nWyoming, and his compulsive shaving foam\nsculptures drove him to seek out the truth. He succeeded where his cultural spawn - Fox Mulderfailed (if, indeed, he has failed).\nWe all want to believe; sometimes out of genuine scientific curiosity but mostly, I suspect,\nthrough a deeper desire, almost as if the 'Do they\nexist?' question will shed light on the 'Why?' of\nhuman existence. These are the very questions that\nKubrick attempted to answer in 2007: A Space\nOdyssey. In fact, Western governments today are\nperceived as the malfunctioning computer HAL,\nwhose distortion of information threatened the\nlives it was designed to protect.\nMulder's personal conflict of serving the gov-ern ment, and his desire to uncover the truth, from\nwhich the same government 'protects' its people is\nvery similar to that of Chief Brody on\nAmity Island - and representative of\nthe psychological conflict of America\nat large. With the Reds defeated, the\nonly battle left is within the American\npeople\nThe 'truth', symbolising the role\nAmerica is desperately searching for\nin the post-Cold War era, will be\nborn screaming and bleeding as the\nMother State is dragged inexorably\ntowards the next millennium. That\nthe truth is 'out there' merely confirms the perception that the government has run out of answers. It is up\nto individual heroes to find the security that is obviously needed.\nMulder's poster, 'I WANT TO BELIEVE' (in aliens) is directed at ourselves, but it\nis merely the flipside of the alternative, implied\nsuffix, 'I WANT TO BELIEVE' (in my government).\nThe desire for truth is thus nothing more than a wish to wrap ourselves once again, in the warmth\nof that giant security blanket we call government.\nSadly it is unlikely. A roll-call of tags which symbolise modern politics trip off the tongue with\nmonotonous repetition: Watergate, Whitewater,\nIrangate, BMARC.\nParadoxically, it is to insurgent politicians that\nwe may have to look; to older, wiser statesmen,\nsidelined by the media as wh in gers, sc ep tics and\nseditious bastards. But they are without the selfish\ngoals and personal ambitions which occupy most\nof today's headlines\nHelp us, Obi Wan Kenobi - you're our only\nhope.\n\n"

    "content": "These are just a number of quotes from the \"Scientific Community\" regarding the\nnature and the origins of the Qur'an. In fact the Qur'an and Hadeeth do not just talk\nabout embryology but hundreds of other phenomenon including the earth and sun\nbeing round, spinning around their own axis and following their own orbits, the\norigin and formation of the universe, the two types of seas between which is a barrier, the role of mountains in s tabi lising the earth's crust, the formation of milk\nin cows, the cause of sexual diseases, the location of pain receptors within the\nbody, the expansion of the universe, the precise nature of the water cycle, the\nchange in atmospheric pressure at high altitudes, the gender of the bee responsible\nfor producing honey (female), the stars consuming themselves via combustion of\ntheir gases and this being the source of their light, and many more.\nCan this all be by chance ?\nExplaining all these statements by chance alone is something which has been\nresorted to, surprisingly by those deemed to be possessors of intellect and\nerudition. However this is not tenable as the following demonstration will show.\nWhen you make a guess regarding the true nature of something (in an accurate and\nprecise manner that is) there are only two possibilities. Either you are right or\nwrong. If you make another guess then you only have one chance in four of being\ncorrect both times. If you make a third guess then you have one chance in eight of\nbeing correct all three times and so on. The chances of correctly describing, lets\nsay, ten phenomena are 1 in 1024. Another point to bear in mind is that the greater\nthe number of things you describe, the chance of being wrong is greater and thus\nthe risk you are taking of being discredited gets bigger and bigger. The Qur'an and\nthe Sunnah (Authentic sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon Him)) make\nstatements on literally hundreds of phenomenon and at the same time openly calls\nthe scientific community to verify them. If one from the scientific community was\nto make hundreds of new claims regarding his particular field and was then to call\n\n"

The repayment would be\ncharged through National\nInsurance contributions once\nstudents were earning more than\nthe national average wage.\nThe announcement comes in\nthe wake of the policy U turn of\nthe National Union of Students\nover Easter. The NUS abolished\nits committed campaign to have\nstudent grants to be returned to\ntheir 1979 levels. Jim Murphy,\nNUS president, said, \"The Union\nis in favour of a fair system of\ncontribution from students who\nhave benefited from higher\neducation if this means that\nstudents will have enough money\nto live on and will have a fair and\nbalanced scheme for repayment\nrelation to their income.\"\nThe Labour Party proposals\nhave also received guarded\nsupport from the Committee of\nVice-Chancellors and Principals,\nwho have long advocated removing students' dependency on\nparental contributions. But they\nexpressed regret that the policy\nstatement did not accept that\n\"payment of tuition fees has to\nshift from the taxpayer to the\nindividual.\"\nThe policy document also\nsupported the principle of\nwidening access to universities,\nbut there was no commitment to\ngiving higher education any\nincreased funding.\nThe independent committee\nset up to review higher education\nfunding, led by Sir Ron Dearing\nmet for the first time on\nTuesday. David Blunkett's paper\nindicated that the details of his\nproposals would be finalised by\nthis inquiry.\nSarah next council chair\nSarah Thomas, the President of\nCity and Guilds College Union,\nhas been elected as next year's ICU council chair at last Friday's AGM.

Though he later\nadmitted that, \"I did think, to\nbe honest, that she stayed on a little, bit too long.\"\nIn relating the meteoric rise\nof John Major, Sir Marcus\ndescribed his initial impressions\nof the Prime Minister when\ninterviewing him as a Lambeth\ncouncillor. He talked of an\ninterview panel that was very\nimpressed by Mr Major, adding\nthat, \"If I had known he would\nhave passed me, in promotion as\nfast as he did, I would have held\nhim back.\"\nSir Marcus went on to\ndiscuss the difficulty of 'healing\nthe divisions' of the Tory back-bench when the party has a Commons majority of just one.\nHis Eurosceptical stance came\nparticularly to the fore with his\ninsistence that 'Europe is our\nbiggest problem', and criticism\nof the 'pettifogging directives\n[that] impinge on our way of\nlife.'\nMuseum lottery award\nThe Science Museum is to\nreceive \u00a325million from the\nNational Lottery to part fund a new wing featuring exhibits on\ncontemporary science, technology and medicine. page 2\n\n"

    "content": "EIGHTEEN FELIX FRIDAY MAY 1 7TH1996 LETTERS\nLETTERS TO FELIX\nREPLIED TO BY SIMON BAKER calculating?\nDear Felix,\nI would like to reply to the comments in Eric Chan's letter on the\nsubject of calculators in examinations. Over the summer, the college examining board decided that\nstudents will no longer be allowed\nto take their own calculators into\nexaminations. Students were not\nconsulted about this decision, as it\nis considered inappropriate for\nthere to be a student presence on\nthe examining board. The possibility of student representation on this\nboard in the future is remote,\nunless we see rioting in all major\ndepartments. Student opinion on\nthis change has since been heard\nby senior college staff at the academic affairs half day and at various\ncollege committees.\nDepartments have dealt with\nthis change in college policy in different ways. Most have chosen a model of calculator which they provide for their students in examinations. The model of calculator\nvaries, leading to some difficulties\nin humanities examinations. The\ncalculator issued by humanities is\nnot necessarily the calculator\nissued by your department.\nIn my opinion, the idea of\nissuing students with a standard\ncalculator is a fair one. I personally would not like to think that I was\nat a disadvantage in an exam\nbecause other people can afford to\nbuy a better calculator than I can,\nparticularly if the advantage that\nthey gained was due to a full set of\nlecture notes in the memory of\ntheir 'calculator' I have been led\nto believe that departmental\nlibraries stock your department's choice of calculator for you to borrow and get used to.\nI do find it disappointing that\nstudents were not consulted on this\nmatter. It is a shame that college\ndid not include the union bookstore in the bulk purchase deal that\nthey no doubt procured. However I expect that college will be keen to\naddress problems arising from this\nchange in policy.\nMatthew Szyndel\nRCSU Academic Affairs Officer\nDear Rachel,\nCalculators in Examinations.\nYour correspondence page suggests that you might welcome further information on the change in\nCollege policy over the use of calculators in examinations.\nAt meetings in autumn 1995\nthe two principal Committees of\nExaminers which oversee undergraduate examinations decided\nthat it was no longer appropriate\nto continue with the current\narrangements. This was because\nthere was concern that students\nwith certain types of machines\nmight enjoy an unfair advantage\nbecause of the increasing difficulties in monitoring the sophisticated\ncalculators now available (pro-gram mable ability, alpha-numeric\ncapability, large memory facility\nand the ability for calculators in the\nsame room to communicate).\nInstead it was decided that, from\nthe summer term examinations,\ncalculators would be provided by\nthe College in accordance with the\nrequirements of each department.\nFor obvious reasons, Boards of\nExaminers are one of the very few\ncommittees at IC which do not\nenjoy student representation.\nOnce, however, the policy decision\nwas taken the Registry moved\nswiftly to consult departments on\ntheir preferred make and model of\ncalculator. Each department was\nfree to choose independently of\nother departments, though, in\npractice, two models only were\nchosen college-wide which\nallowed for bulk buying. Each\ndepartment had its stock of calculators available to them in January\n1996, at the beginning of the\nspring term, allowing plenty of\ntime for students to practise on the\nmodel chosen by their department.\nYours sincerely,\nFV McClure\nAcademic Registrar\nIt is certainly the case that the\nscope for cheating with the\nsuper calculators was very great\nand something had to be done.\nAs for student consultation.\nMatt, that's a forlorn hope. Thin\nend of the wedge, my boy, bad\nfor discipline.\nJeliglitkil?\nDear Rachel,\nIn Felix 1056, you suggested in the\nfirst instance that Security Officers\nslept whilst on duty, and later stated that there are \"plenty of\nabsolutely delightful security staff'.\nSecurity staff are entitled to\nscheduled breaks, this is not to say\nthat they sleep during this time. As\nfor not being paid enough, that is\nnot for you to comment on but the\nresponsibility of the individual of fi cer.\nYou also mentioned \"not challenged enough\". You, Rachel,\ncould not begin to comprehend the\nvarious jobs and duties we under-take, perhaps you would like to\njoin us on a72 hour shift and see\nif your views are the same on completion of that duty. We try to\nundertake our duties in the most\nprofessional way we can, taking\ninto account the circumstances at\nthe time, at the end of the day we\nhave to make a decision.\nI would now like to answer Mr\nSimon Baker (issue 1057). First of\nall the V&A does not house or\nexhibit '1 942 Stormtrooper outfits'.\nPerhaps you use the same\nresearcher as 'Richard & Judy' or\ndid you do it all by yourself?\nClosure of the Falmouth gates\nat 11 pm - they are closed for two\nreasons, the left hand pedestrian\ngate was closed originally to allow\nnoise to be kept to an acceptable\nlevel when passing the private flats\nopposite 170 Queens Gate.\nClosure of the gates at midnight in\nmy experience would only raise the\nnoise level by people using it as a short cut from bar areas such as\nSouthside and Beit Quad. The right\nhand gate was closed when the\nLibrary building work began to\nprevent accidents.\nWhilst writing, I would like to\ntake the opportunity to thank you\nfor the article on the tragic loss of\nVic Turner, who will be sadly\nmissed by us all.\nYours sincerely\nGary Gray\nMay I congratulate you on your\nencyclopaedic knowledge of the\nV&A collection. The article\nshould have read \"from the\n1942 Stormtrooper at C&A col-lect ion.\" Methinks your love of\nthis great museum led you to\nmiss the point slightly. The\nquestion of pay was spec ul a tion, not given as fact, but I must agree with you on the\nchallenge and variety of the\njob. The fact remains that some\nof your staff are sometimes\nplain rude to students. As for\nthe gates, if you wanted to prevent accidents due to the building work, why not seal it all off?\npoor library\nDear Felix,\nYou are quite right that, in comparison with Oxford, and to a much less extent with Cambridge,\nexpenditure on libraries in College,\n44 out of 100, according to the\nGood Universities Guide, is rather\npoor. The situation is even worse\nsince the figures for Oxbridge\nexclude expenditure on books published in the UK: under the legal\ndeposit scheme they receive these\nfree. Lavish spending on libraries is\nsupported out of their endowments\nand, in addition, HEFCE gives \u00a31.1\nmillion per annum to the Bodleian\nand to Cambridge under the non-formula funding arrangement to\ncover the additional costs created\nby their legal deposit status.\nWhen you look at the rest of\nthe field, IC is the third best, following the two specialist Social\nSciences institutions, LSE and the\nUniversity of Buckingham, which\nregard their libraries as labs.\nNevertheless, it would be foolish to\nbe complacent. The British Library\nis cutting thousands of current\nperiodicals, so resources in London\nwill be greatly diminished. As for\nelectronic publications, they cost\nextra for site licences and equipment and expert staff to run them.\nYours sincerely,\nMrs Magda Czigany\nDirector of Library and AudioVisual Services\nI was surprised at the low rat-ing, having used the library a lot recently. Cambridge do\nhave the upper hand in one\nrespect. They've just banned\nmobile phones from all their\nlibraries. Please take note.\nLetters may be edited for\nlength. Deadline for letters\nin Felix 1059: midday,\nTuesday 28th May\n\n"

With the\nfestivities taken out of sight and\nearshot, ' attendance at the\nfundraising occasion was mini-mal.\nA spokesman from the charity Turning Point said, \"It's a pity\nthere aren't any students here...\nbut we're all holding each other\nup.\" The Royal National Lifeboat\nInstitute, The Imperial Cancer\nResearch Fund and the\nLeukaemia Research Fund also\nhad stalls, but there were only\naround six students visiting, most\nof them committed Raggies,\nwhen the event was well underway at 3.30pm.

    "content": "memo rise it by heart. They are expected to learn its meaning and practice its\nteachings.\nThe Qur'an is unrivalled in its recording and preservation. The astonishing fact\nabout this book of Allah is that it has remained unchanged even to a dot, over the\npast 1400 years. The Qur'an deals with man and his ultimate goal in life, its\nteachings cover all areas of this life and life after death. It contains principles,\ndoctrines and directions for every sphere of human life. The theme of the Qur'an\nbroadly consists of three fundamental ideas: Absolute Monotheism,\nMessengership, and the life after death. The success of human beings on this earth\nand in the life hereafter depends upon obedience to the Qur'anic teachings.\nThe Imperial College Islamic Society, May 1996.\nNote: All quotes have been taken from a video in which after having been\npresented with the statements in the Qur'an and Hadeeth and given the chance to\ninvestigate, the various scientists were questioned as to their opinion regarding the\nQur'an. Their response was recorded live. The video is called \"The Truth\" and is\navailable from the Islamic Society upon request.

    "content": "all his fellow specialists to prove him wrong he would know without doubt that he\nis standing on an undermined sand cliff which is ready to crumble with him. How\nthen for the one who makes statements about the specialities of others?\nJudge the Qur'an scientifically ?\nOne will be surprised to learn that such a scientific approach has been commanded\nin the Qur'an with the objective of ascertaining its truthfulness.\nDo they not carefully consider (investigate) the Qur'an or are there locks\nupon their hearts. [Surah 47:24]\nDo they not carefully analyse the Qur'an. If it had been from other than\nAllah then surely they would have found many discrepancies therein [Surah\n4:82]\nSo religious (that is Islamic) beliefs are not based upon blind acceptance, contrary\nto the commonly held view applied to all religions including the Qur'an and Islam.\nThis has been the experience of Europe in the past 300-400 years in which\nscientific advancement and its findings were seen as heretical, its proponents\nridiculed and often exiled and tortured. Islam, has never had that experience.\nIt is true that peoples academic capabilities differ and thus some will be unable to\nascertain the truth of it and therefore may accept it blindly. But again they have the\nopportunity to ask the people of knowledge, those who are in a position to make\nsuch a judgement, like those quoted above. It is from the principles of wisdom and\njustice that when you don't know you don't make a judgement yourself but rather\nconsult one who is in a position to do so. In fact this is something Allah has also\ncommanded:\nSo ask the People of Knowledge if you do not know [Surah 21:7]\nand He (Allah) has also said\nAnd those who have been given Knowledge know that that which has been\nrevealed to you from your Lord is the Truth [Surah 34:6]\n\n"
