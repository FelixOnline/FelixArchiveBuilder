But that didn't make it hurt\nany less. Luckily my head took most of the impact.\nWhich explains why I am unable to put out a film section of\nany sort of quality this week. Look, I even had to try and fill in\nthe gap with a picture of an empty room. Not quite empty\nthough. There are two planks in the bottom left-hand corner of\nthe room. Interesting.\nIn a few weeks time, March 24th to be precise, the Academy\nwill be celebrating the finest in film. The creme-de-la-creme of\nHollywood will be there; handing out distinguished awards to\none another. That's why we at Felix On Film have decided to run\nour own special awards ceremony. The Oscraps celebrate the\nworst movies of 2001.\nThis year the nominations for Worst Picture include such\ngems as the final nail in Steven Seagal's coffin, Exit wounds,\nMariah Carey's excellently bad, Glitter, the sprawling three\nhour epic of shite ness, Peari Harbour, and of course, Time Lapse.\nSeagal's work is, in fact, nominated in three different cate-go ries. These include prestigious recognition the Lifetime\nAchievement category, where he competes against the likes of\nJim Varney, of Ernest Goes to Jail fame, Lone Wolf McQuaid's Chuck Norris, and Steve Guttenberg, whose work on the Police\nAcademy series has scarred me for life.\nFreddy Got Fingered features strongly with Tom Green getting a unprecedented double nomination in the Worst Director\nand Worst Actor categories. There is also deserved recognition\nfor Paul Hogan's Crocodile Dundee III.\nThis year we have also had some really bad endings. If you've\nseen Planet Of The Apes you would know exactly what I'm talking about. Vanilla Sky does, in a similar vein, go from bad to\nworse in the last quarter. That's why we have introduced a special category for movies which run out of breath in the final\nstraight. Movies which run out of breath, trip up over their own\nlaces, hit the gravel, and stay there. Biting the dust.\nApart from that, JCR shop, get your act together. IC Sixths,\nwe will win on Saturday at Motspur Park. Everyone else hang\ntight inside the ride - cos' here comes the rewind!\n\"The Oscraps\"\nWe Salute the Worst of 2001\nWorst Picture\nFreddy Got Fingered (20th Century Fox)\nGlitter (20th Century Fox/Sony)\n*Pearl Harbour (Touchstone)\nTime Lapse (Lions' Gate Films.

    "content": "NUS debate\nNo To NUS\nOn Thursday and Friday next week, you\nwill be asked for the first time in seven\nyears whether you want to take Imperial\nCollege back into the National Union of\nStudents. Those of us in the ever-growing\n'No' campaign believe that such a move\nwould be detrimental to the life of students at Imperial College. This article tells\nyou why you should vote 'No' to the NUS.\nMembership would cost \u00a335,000 per\nyear - that's a10% cut for your clubs and\nsocieties!\nDon't let anyone tell you otherwise. Sure,\nthey might try to tempt us with a discount\nin the first year, but after that it's at least\n\u00a335,000 per year for membership - and that\nmoney is coming from the College's sub ven tion to the Union. There's no more pots of\ngold in the Sherfield Building to bail us out\n- it's \u00a335,000 less for your clubs and soci-e ties, union services, developments, new\ninitiatives, academic representation and\nwelfare. In real terms that's a10% cut for all\nclubs and societies - do you think the Union\nwill cut its staff and administration budgets\nbefore they cut yours?\nIn short, Imperial College could affiliate to\nthe NUS, or it could give a full grant to the\nAfro-Caribbean, Arabic, Bangladeshi,\nChinese, Cypriot, Erasmus, French,\nGerman, Hellenic, Indian, Indonesian,\nIranian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Korean,\nLebanese, Malaysian, Mauritian, Pakistan,\nScandinavian, Singapore, Spanish, Sri\nLankan, Taiwanese, Thai Soc, Choir,\nDramSoc, Jazz Big Band, Jazz & Rock Soc,\nLeonardo Soc, Musical Theatre, Orchestra,\nSinfonietta, Classical Guitar, Jazz Big Band,\nAbacus, Amnesty International, Artsoc,\nCathSoc, Christian Student Action,\nChristian Union, ConSoc, Debating,\nEnvironmental, Finance, Hindu, His People,\nIQ (LGB), Islamic, Jewish, Krishna\nConsciousness, Labour, Pimlico, Pugwash,\nRocksoc, Science Fiction, Sikh, Student\nIndustrial Society and Origami societies. It's your choice.\n\"But we would get 'money back' through\njoining NUSSL!\"\nNot strictly true. NUSSL is the bulk-buy-ing group that would take over all the\nUnion's bar, catering and shop purchasing.\nWith their current price range (which is likely to change this year anyway) in the best-case scenario the Union might gain \u00a39,000\nper year, but this would mean adding an\naverage of lOp to the price of every pint -that works out as your entire beer budget\nfor the first two weeks of term!\nAt the moment we buy our beer through\nTUCO - another purchasing consortium -which gives us low prices and good service.\nThe suppliers that NUSSL uses have all\nbeen used by ICU in the past, and have\nalways provided us with a bad service.\nWhy join an organisation that makes us use\nsuppliers we don't like?\nIt gets better! NUSSL want to tell you\nwhat to drink - and they don't stock\nCarlsberg, Lowenbrau or Castlemaine\nXXXX - all best sellers in the Union bars!\nAnd just when you thought it couldn't get\nany worse - there will be a severe restriction\non the number of Real Ales that the Union\ncan sell.\nBut guess what? That's not all, folks!\nNUSSL is obliged to stick to the NUS \"eth i cal\" policy, imposed by the NUS National\nExecutive, which would prohibit us from\nselling things like KitKats. We believe that\nImperial College students should be the\nonly people who decide what gets sold in\nour Union's bars, shop and newsagent.\n\"But we could get national representation\nfrom the NUS.\"\nThe , Yes campaign would have you\nbelieve that without the NUS, Imperial\nCollege students don't have a voice at a national level. They say that if nurses,\nteachers and farmers' have national bodies,\nthen students should as well. We agree. But\njust as there are many different unions for\nall these groups of workers, so should there\nbe for students.\nDoes a student at Imperial CollegeEurope's leading academic institution of sci-en ce, technology and medicine - need the\nsame representation as students who\nattend Merthyr Tydfil College? Why is it an\nadvantage for you to be represented by the\nsame people who represent technical col-leg es, or Further Education colleges?\nImperial College Union was one of the\nfounder members of the Aldwych Group, a group of students unions from the so-called\n'ivy league1 of universities in the UK. They\ntake notice of us. Last year's ICU President,\nHamish Common was Chairman of the\nAldwych Group. It was Tasha Newton, an\nICU President, who persuaded the top 12\nuniversities and colleges to rule out top-up\nfees. When the Dearing Committee on\nHigher Education Funding wanted to find\nout real students' views on student finance,\ndid they go to a student body that's in the\nNUS? They didn't. They came to Imperial.\nPeople want to know your views because\nyou're students at Europe's equivalent of\nMIT. We don't need to pay \u00a335,000 for that\nprivilege. You get it when you sign up.\nThe Yes campaign will tell you that the\nNUS introduced the London Transport\nDiscount Scheme. They didn't. The NUS\nhijacked it at the last minute, and the\nscheme has never been right since.\nTuition fees in Scotland? They don't exist\nanymore. The Yes campaign will tell you\nthat the NUS were behind the abolition of\nfees, but the students who ran the campaign tell a different story. How many of the\nfive Scottish universities who overturned\nfees were part of the NUS? One. The other\nfour have been out for years.\nThe NUS claim to be the only effective\nlobbying organisation in the country. In fact,\nthey're the only student organisation in the\nUK that hasn't had a victory in four years.\n\"But we can get discounts from Top Man\nand HMV if we join!\"\nAnd you can get discounts from Tower\nRecords if you walk in there today with your\nIC card. The power of an NUS card to secure\na discount is getting weaker every year; in\ncontrast, go for some retail therapy around\nLondon and you'll find that most shops that\noffer a \"student discount\" will accept your\nIC card, your ULU card, your ISIC card - the\nlist gets longer.\nYour Vote Counts.\nOn Thursday and Friday you have a choice - a vote for an effective, value for\nmoney, campaigning body providing the\nservices you need and much more - or a vote for the NUS.\nTo learn more about why you should vote\n'No' to the NUS, or to help with the cam-pa ign, please visit our website at\nhttp://union.ic.ac.uk/no2n us/ "

    "content": "LIVE: Mull Historical Society\n+ Minuteman @ Scala\nThe Scala was packed out this evening, with hundreds upon\nhundreds of Colin Maclntyre's fans cramming themselves into\nthe venue to see the legendary man himself. First though, we\nwere administered with a dose of Minuteman, probably to\nmake sure that we were all suitably sedated before Mull\nHistorical Society came on stage.\nMinuteman were consistently disappointing. They started off\nevery song with something extremely promising, but unfortunately each track soon degenerated into a bland, incomprehensibly forgettable m ish mash of randomly selected guitar riffs\nand mo any, whiny vocals. The Nirvana wannabes treated us to\na whole set of brainwashing ly boring tunes.\nTake one mole of cheesy pop, dissolve it in some rocking guitar\nriffs, stir in any instruments you can find (from flute to steel\ndrums) and add a spatula full of a man with a mission to put his\nhome on the map. Watch the fireworks and then admire the finished product - Mull Historical Society.\nThe crowd, although slightly drowsy from the warm-up act,\nwere more than ready. Colin (pic above) gave it his best, bringing out the choirboys again for a proper rendition of Instead and\npractically smashing up the stage.\nThe set was absolutely blinding, and everyone was excited to\nhear three new songs from the second album. Of course, Colin\nalso pulled all the old tricks out of the bag, causing riotous\npogo-dancing with the latest single Watching Xanadu and\nalmost leaping into the crowd while singing Barcode Bypass.\nAt the end, everyone was elbowing each other in the face as\nthey tried to grab one of the inflatable sheep released from the\nceiling. One girl nearly threw me to the floor in her (failed)\nattempt to retrieve a feather boa from the stage.\nAll in all, a very decent night, but if you're planning on going\nto an MHS gig and standing near the front, make sure you're\nequipped with full riot gear.\nmusic reviews\nLIVE: Fonda 500 + Edible\n5ft Smiths @ Metro\nTwo quid fifty for a bottle of Stella? This is why we don't go to\ngigs on Oxford Street. But Edible 5ft Smiths are mental. After a rubbish first number, they get into the swing: Christmas Song\nstarts as an angular thrash reminiscent of The Fall, then turns\ninto the Beach Boys' Christmas album, then, sadly, into a Coldplay-style indie ballad. It's like this all through the set as\nthe band, with an anorexic Steve Tyler of a frontman, lurch from\none musical extreme to another. One track sounds like It's Not\nUnusual with more thrash y bits. Another could be The Byrds in\na bad light. The whole thing finishes with the inevitable apocalyptic finale and then some echo ey wailing for good measure.\nMisty's Big Adventure play desperately shit, cheesy gimp-a thon music. They're like the worst, most corny hippy band from\nGlastonbury who get \"high on life\" instead of on good honest\nLSD. They wouldn't be completely out of place playing in a market town on a Saturday morning, with hideous inbred yokels\nlaughing at the colourful costumes. They had a guy dancing in a suit with gloves stuck all over it. Whoa, trip py, man...\nFonda 500 (pic above) are doggedly unremarkable. By now, I 've\nmanaged to get fairly drunk, even with these ridiculous prices,\nand still none of their songs penetrate the beer y fu g with sufficient panache to be memorable. Shame, for the band seem so\nnice - the singer has a big hat with furry ears, and the bassist\nis kinda cute in a Chrissie Hynde sort of way. She is, her flat\nmate writes in my notebook, \"the coolest girl ever\". Even cool-er, apparently, than Kim Deal or Kim Gordon.\nJesus, have I really come to Oxford Street to cover a gig? Or\nam I just wandering around in a drunken frenzy of some kind?\nFonda 500 continue to be stunningly average throughout.

    "content": "debate NUS\nNUS - Discounts and a National Voice\nA Note by David Francis, Deputy\nPresident (Education & Welfare), Imperial\nCollege Union.\nOn March 14th and 15th, you'll have the\nopportunity to change your experience of\nImperial College. For the first time since\n1995, Imperial students are being given a chance to join the National Union of\nStudents, the organisation which represents and achieves discounts for 98% of\nhigher and further education students in\nthe UK.\nNUS would provide direct benefits for\nevery student at Imperial and for our union.\nThe NUS card is the one nationally recognised proof of student status giving access\nto a wide range of discounts ranging from\nburgers to theatre tickets. This benefit\npackage has been enhanced through the\ndevelopment of www.nus online. co.uk On\nthe site you will find news, advice, information and access to a number of special\noffers. Sadly, Imperial students cannot currently access the discounts (for example\n10% off all purchases from HMV) as we're\nnot affiliated.\nThe services that NUS can offer our union\nrange from high quality tailored training for\nour elected officers, through to access to\ndiscounted deals for our bars, catering and\nshops, via NUS Services Ltd. (NUSSL);\nwhich means more income for our union\nand better prices for us. The reduction in\ncosts which membership of NUSSL would\nbring has been calculated to be up to\n\u00a325,000. Joining NUS would cost us \u00a335,000\nand to join NUSSL - this is optional, but only\nopen to NUS affiliates - would be another\n\u00a360. Peanuts considering ICU last year\nspent \u00a345,000 on the wiring of the West\nBasement in Beit Quad (as opposed to a budget of \u00a315,000) and \u00a314,-000 on French\nPolishing the Union Dining Hall.\nWhat then does NUS offer other than discounts and cheap beer? Perhaps most\nimportant of all is national representation.\nThe need for a national representative voice\nfor students remains as great today as it\nwas in 1922 when the NUS was founded.\nThe recent growth in the student population has enormous implications for funding\nand for the nature and quality of the educational experience. NUS has been the one\nnational voice calling consistently for the\nabolition of fees and the restoration of the\nYes To NUS\nmaintenance grant for students. You may\nhave heard the recent announcement that\nWales has followed Scotland in reinstating\nstudent grants. That now leaves England\nout of step. We need to make sure that the\ngovernment recognises the hardship and\nunique needs of Imperial students.\nAt the moment we are among the 2% of\nstudents in the UK without a national voice\nand a YES vote for NUS is the only way we\nare going to be heard. Imperial College\nUnion needs to be part of a strong National\nUnion that is maintaining the pressure on\ngovernment. NUS achieved a massive\nturnout and unprecedented press coverage\nin its national demonstration on 20\nFebruary. Owain James, the National\nPresident, got the message of student hardship broadcast to millions through the BBC,\nITV Channel 4, Sky and many local news\nprogrammes. He even appeared on Richard\nand Judy!\nNATIONAL UNION OF STUDENTS\nThe government know that the present\nsystem is not delivering. Thanks to the hard\nwork and targeted campaigning of NUS and\nstudents' unions across the country change\nis inevitable. It is up to us to vote YES to\nensure that our voice is heard when the\ndecisions about just how the system will\nchange are being made. 700 students'\nunions representing over 4 million people of\nall ages studying in universities and col-leg es, working together through NUS, have\nthe collective strength to win change and to\nkeep the student movement a force that\nmust be listened to.\nNUS is more than a nationally recognised\ncampaigning body. Professional\nresearchers sit on a host of technical committees working behind the scenes to give\na student view on issues such as quality\nassurance, careers services, student\nemployment and training for lecturers. NUS\nhave access to the heart of policy development and decision making; 98% of students'\nunions in the UK have access to this sup-port. Imperial College's students do not.\nAnd there's more. NUS has a wide range\nof support and advice services for our union\nand for students. They have specialist legal,\nhousing, and student financial support\nadvisors. They regularly produce briefings\non a whole range of areas, ensuring officers\nare kept up to date with changes in the law\nand involved in campaigns. NUS Ents negotiate with bands and DJ's to provide free\ntours of the country. LSE's students can\naccess this - why can't we?\nNUS is a democratic organisation, with\nevery union able to send representatives to\ntheir annual conference to make policy and\nelect the executive.\nWhat about the arguments of the \"No\"\ncampaign? What are their arguments\nagainst joining? Well, I 've had a good look at\ntheir website and, apart from a lot of opinion there seem to be very few \"facts\".\nYou do NOT have to declare a political\nallegiance to join the NUS. The current president was elected as an Independent, and\nthe largest political group - Labour Students\n- has only 6 out of 26 members of the national executive. While it would cost \u00a335,000\nper annum to affiliate Imperial could save\n\u00a325,000 by joining NUSSL. The cost of\n\u00a310,000 is a fairly small sum to find in our\nunion, which has an annual i turnover of\nover \u00a33.5million. It could be found in a variety of ways and certainly would not require\nbeer prices to rise or clubs and society\nbudgets to be cut.\nThey say that NUS is so big it can't properly represent Imperial students when it\nalso speaks for students from across the UK.\nSurely we would be better off with a strong\nnational union representing us on national\nissues and supporting our union on local\nissues rather than ICU on it's own out in the\ncold? Teachers, farmers, police officers and\ndoctors are all represented by national bod-ies, why should it be different for students?\nWhat motivates the \"No\" campaign? We\nnote that this campaign is being led and\nrun by union hacks that have failed to give\nImperial students a choice on affiliation\nsince 1995. Perhaps they like to feel isola t ed. Perhaps they don't care if we have discounts or want us to have a national voice.\nNUS is the largest independent student\norganisation in the world providing a unique range of services and a strong voice\nfor students; a voice that is heard where\ndecisions are made. Your vote can make you\npart of that voice. On Thursday, 14 and\nFriday, 15 March, vote YES to NUS.\n\n"

There have been a series of\nevents this week to mark the closure of\nGladys', giving supporters of the bar an\nopportunity to prop it up one last time.\nKing George V and Queen Mary opened the 'new' St Mary's Medical\nSchool building in 1933, which included\nthe student-dining hall, Gladys'. Since\nthen Gladys' has been the centre for\nmed school life in Paddington. It has\nbeen a venue for concerts, shows and, of\ncourse, cheesy bops.\nMuch to the disappointment of the\nstudents and doctors, Gladys' is being\nclosed to make way for new research\nfacilities. The bar has been kept open\nthis year thanks to the hard work of the\nbar committee and our bar manager,\nKatie Schwab.\nAll tickets for tonight have been sold\nwell in advance (well, it is half price\ndrinks). I'm sure Gladys' will get the\nsend off it deserves.\nCharing Cross Refurbishment\nOn the other side of London, in\nHammersmith, things are very different.\nThe much needed refurbishment of the\nCharing Cross student facilities looks\nset to be complete by mid March. When\nthe area is finally opened, students can\nexpect a brand new funky bar (or is it a pub?) a comfy cafeteria, a coffee area, a gym and bop/dance area complete with\nDJ booth, stage and lighting, and all the\nassociated accoutrements!\nThe project has been split into two\nmain phases, as the \u00a3800,000 raised was\nonly sufficient for the ground floor refurbishment. We hope to start the second\nphase, which includes the toilets and\nbasement, once further funding has\nbeen secured, so watch out for new\ndevelopments.\nGiven the number of students now living in Hammersmith, and the loss of the\nMary's bar, we are all looking forward to\nthe new facilities opening, and are especially looking forward to the big opening\nparty...\nMedics Rag This year's Medic Rag Week has beaten all ICSM RAG records, raising over\n\u00a355,000. The Rag Dash to Edinburgh\nwas a great warm up to the week's events, raising over \u00a36,000. The week\nitself included Breakfast at Imperial's, ICS&M RAG Games and the infamous\nCircle Line Pub Crawl. London was\ninvaded all week by hundreds of students in scrubs, completing various\nchallenges and collecting loads of\nmoney for Children with Cancer and\nLeukaemia. Congratulations to the Rag\nTeam who worked incredibly hard for\nthe last few months, especially to\nHayley Kirsop the Rag Chair.\nMore news\nThe new ICSM SU website is now up\nand running, complete with the latest\nnews, contacts and personal prefer-en ces. Thank you to Phil Ward, who has\nworked incredibly hard on setting this\nup. Check out www.su.ic.ac.uk/medic\nShazia Munir, ICSM SU President\nChaplaincy\nWhat does working in the City do to\npeople's humanity?\n\"Being Human in the Square Mile\" - a talk given in the chaplaincy last week-kick started a few discussions. Victor\nStock, priest of a church at the heart of\nthe city, gave his reflections on 15 years\nof listening to stories of city dealers and\nfinanciers.\nThe City in popular imagination is a place driven with the need to make\nmoney. It is a place where increasing the\nnumbers and maxim ising profit on deals\nis the measure of success. Failure, and\nthe fear of failure, is the shadow side of\nthis pursuit of success. There is the collective fear that \"London will be eclipsed\nby Frankfurt\". Then there are the personal fears of failing in the race to increase\nprofit. So in what ways can true human\nsuccess and failure be measured?\nWhen the personal fears of those at the\ntop stifle the trust and imagination of\neveryone else the organisation becomes\na hellish place to be.\nOf course the City offers the compensation of making a great deal of money.\nOne of Victor's interesting observations\nis the process City workers go through\nwhen they retire from the money business in their forties. This premature age\nof retirement coming partly because\nthere is no financial reason to carry on\nworking.\nThis raises the questions for people\n\"what is my life about?\" and \"now that I have the freedom to chose what to do\nwith my life what am I going to choose?\"\nVictor's role had been that of helping\nindividuals to reflect upon these issues.\nThese are questions for all of us but the\ndaily pressures of work and study can\nmake it harder to encounter these ques-t ions. The City, so busy Monday to Friday, is\ndeserted on Saturdays and Sundays. It is\nan extreme example of the separation in\nurban life of work place and living place.\nWe find meaning in our day-to-day,\nface to face relationships. With friends\nand good colleagues we can be our-selves. At the same time, however, we\nare surrounded by millions of others. The\nvastness of the city offers extreme isolation and loneliness. Yet the anonymity\nalso offers freedom to explore new\noptions and ways of living. This is also\nthe dilemma of student life in a universi-ty. There is the freedom to explore identity but also the risk of being outside the\ngroup. There are also the options of staying within the like-minded tribe or moving into new groups and contacts.\nSo, the question posed by our speaker\nfrom the city is: \"Is our humanity\nenriched or eroded by the places in\nwhich we live or the organisations in\nwhich we work?\"\nFor further opportunities to reflect on\nbeing human join us on Wednesday 20th March, 1 pm, when our guest speaker is\nLucy Winkett from St.Paul's Cathedral.\n\n"

    "content": "reviews music\nINTERVIEW with\nBeverley Knight\nBeverley Knight's new album Who I Am is released on Monday\n(see review, left), and she is currently touring the UK with\nJamiroquai (a live review will appear in Felix soon).\nFELIX: This album is very different from Prodigal Sista. What\ninspired the changes?\nBEVERLEY: This album is different and progressive. There are\nsome overlapping points with Prodigal Sista, but this album is\ndeliberately broad-based to reflect my creative influences. I wanted to reflect my musical background.\nHow do you think people are going to receive your album?\nThe album is all about moving forward and I feel really good\nabout it. I don't think it will be a shock to my fans. People understand progression, and I feel that my fans are growing with me.\nYou've been doing a lot of collaborations recently. How do\nyou decide who to work with?\nWell, with Jay K, he asked me to work on his album and support\nhim on the tour. James Poise connected me to Musique Soul\nChild.\nWhat was it like working with Musique Soul Child?\nHe's very easy to work with. Musique comes across shy but\nhe's always laughing at my accent.\nDid you write all the songs on the album? Are you talking\nabout people you know well or are all the songs about you?\nAll my songs, except Falling Soldier which is about Steven\nLawrence, are usually about me and are quite personal. They're\nalso about people I know. When I wrote the album, I was coming out of a long-term relationship, so I had to be myself and\nstand strong. For instance, Shoulda Woulda Coulda is very much\nabout that relationship, and there was a lot of pain associated\nwith that. I had to put all that emotion down.\nWhat inspired Get Up?\nGet Up was the first single from the album, and it was a call to\narms. It was also about personal identity, with the dancehall\ninfluence. I'm really glad it did so well in the charts.\nDo you think UKR& B gets the kind of success it deserves?\nIt's difficult doing R&B in the UK. For me, the biggest prejudice\nis culture. People think that unless it's coming from America,\nany R&B tune is just not good enough.\nDo you think UKR& B is becoming \"more garage\"?\nI don't know, but I have done some garage remixes. I don't intend to move to garage though, for exactly the same reason\nwhy I don't do house - it's not me!\nCan you tell me what input you have regarding your music\nvideos?\nI don't have as tight a reign as I would like to - except for the\nGet Up video. I wanted people to see me perform live. In my\nnext video [Shoulda Woulda Coulda], I try to put the song across\nin a non-cheese way.\nSo what are you doing next?\nWell, I'm going on tour with Jay Kay, then I'm headlining my\nown tour - I 'll be touring the UK for 10 days.\nKoram\nLIVE: Bubba Sparxxx +\nPrincess Superstar +\nDilated Peoples @ Astoria\nThe evening ends with the crowd bottling the stage in disgust\nat Bubba Sparxxx's premature exit. He's only been on stage for\nfifteen minutes. Granted, they were fifteen excellent minutes,\nracing through of half a dozen tracks from his debut album and\nculminating with an excellent version of Ugly, but given that\nthe album is eighty minutes long, there's no excuse.\nIt might have been forgivable if Sparxxx (pic above) hadn't made us wait for three quarters of an hour after Dilated Peoples\nleft the stage. On the other hand, he was still easily the highlight of the evening - while Bubba's problem was that he didn't stay on stage for long enough, Dilated's was that they should\nhave departed long before they finally did. With boring, weak\nbeats and weaker lyrics, they're everyone's indie rap nightmare.\nAdd in repeated attempts to see which side of the audience can\nshout louder and you've got a very dull forty-five minutes.\nWhich leaves Princess Superstar. Before the gig, I'd half written her off as a lame New York iron is t with a couple of OK tunes,\nand this performance did nothing to change my opinion.\nProblem number one: her beats are weak. Like so many, she\nseems to think that she can get away with nondescript production because her rh y mm g's so good. But it doesn't work for\n\"real\" rappers, and it certainly doesn't work for her. Problem\ntwo: her voice is weak. She lacks authority and doesn't even\nhold our attention. But the real difficulty is problem three: she\njust doesn't have the whole sex thing down at all. Unlike\nMadonna, or even Britney, she hasn't realised that making the\noccasional reference to being \"kinkier than pubic hair\" isn't enough to make you a sex symbol. Give me Li'l Kim any day.\nTcbv G "

    "content": "talk back\nJCR Chair Trauma\nDear Felix,\nOnce again my damned foolish conscience has made me speak out. I have discovered another way in which whoever\nprovided our college facilities failed to take\ninto account that this is Imperial College\nand thus wasted funds. In this case, it is\nchairs. If you spend as much time taking\ncoffee breaks in the JCR as I do you would\nnotice the severe discrepancy between the\nnumber of chairs and the number of people\nsitting on them, small knots of people sit at\none end of a row and perhaps another\nclique will be at the other but in between\nthere are vast gaps of empty, apparently\nuninhabitable space. If you are now bored,\nrest assured, there is a point, this is not just\na letter about chairs or even college inefficiency, it is about you people.\nYes, it's true; IC has caught the London\ntransport syndrome, the bug that prevents\ntwo strangers from voluntarily sitting next\nto each other on the bus. Now admittedly\nI 've had bad experiences with people who\ntry to talk on the tube and as far as I'm concerned you're welcome to be suspicious of\nsomeone who might be carrying a knife or\nconcealed bible out there in the real world,\nbut in the common room? The most you\nhave to fear is being drawn into a discussion about complex integrals by a man with\nan offensive beard, you are in no physical\ndanger, you never know, you might even\nenjoy the experience. In this way you can\nmake new friends or discover people who\ncan do your work for you. Who knows,\namongst the discarded coffee cups and\npolystyrene trays you might find love. OK,\nso that's going a bit far but I'm sure you\nunderstand what I'm trying to encourage.\nThrow off the shackles of science fiction\naddiction, tear yourself away from that\ncomputer game and interact with real pe o ple. Talk without typing, make some of\nthose sound waves you've been taught\nabout and tell that guy just how much you\nlove his beard.\nPete\nThe next set of letters are all opinion pieces.\nI do not correct individual mistakes in let-ter s, so bear in mind that what these letters\nsay is not necessarily true: read the NUS features to find out more.\nMore NUS Talk\nDear Will,\nFortunately I have been fairly well isolated from ICU politics this year so I'm not sure\nif the points I am about to make have\nalready been made, but if not I think it's about time someone said something to\nmake ICU council and the Sabbaticals come\nto their senses!\nReferendums are expensive things.\nIndeed the budget for running the referendum is set at \u00a32,000 - \u00a31,500 for the cost of\nthe people to sit on the ballot boxes and\n\u00a3250 per campaign! Is it just me that thinks\nthat this is all a big waste of money since\npretty much everyone is against it\n(including all the ICU presidents for the\npast 6 years). Even the current President,\nSen, who suggested the referendum is\narguing against it! I personally find it quite\nironic that the biggest argument against\njoining the NUS is the cost of affiliation, yet\nICU is wasting thousands of pounds just so\nthat it can been seen to be democratic - I think on that score this years sabbaticals\nare closing the barn door well after the\nhorse has bolted.\nOn the subject of cost I would also liked\nto know which muppet was so disorganised to hold two sets of campus wide elections this year - one for sabbaticals, the\nother a referendum on the NUS. The cost\ncould have almost been wiped in half if people had been asked to vote on both at the\nsame time because you would only need to\npay one set of people to sit on the ballot\nboxes!\nAfter all the cock-ups this year maybe IC\ncould do with joining the NUS if only so\nthere's someone to hold Council's hands\nand stop all of these stupid decisions!\nYours faithfully,\nTim\nEx IC student\nDear Sir,\nI would like to point out a couple of points\nwith respect to the upcoming referendum\non NUS affiliation. The main reason put forward by the pro-campaigners seems to be\nthat I will be able to get a nice shiny NUS\ncard which will allow me to get nice shiny\ndiscounts at high street shops. However, I was under the impression that since IC is a college of the University of London, we are\nall entitled to ULU NUS cards. It simply\nentails us getting one at the fresher s' fair or\n(heaven forbid!) actually going to the ULU\nbuilding and applying for a card.\nSeeing as Union funding has already\nbeen cut for next year, I can see no real benefit to be gained from a \u00a3 50.000,- affiliation\nto an organization which seems only to further the political career of its president and\ncommittee - money which would have to\ncome from somewhere. However much the\nUnion structure can be streamlined, the losers will be the students in the end, as\nmoney is taken away from student\nactivites. Imperial has one of the best union\nclub and society scenes in the U.K., and\nsome of the cheapest bars in London - let's keep it that way.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. Whitfield, Aero 2\nDear Sir,\nWith the NUS referendum getting close, I thought I would like to bring up a few\npoints that have been bothering me for a while.\nJoining the NUS would mean paying\naround \u00a357,000 subscription next year (and\nthis would most probably increase later).\nCollege is not prepared to give any more\nmoney to the Union and the money would\ntherefore have to come out of the clubs and\nsocieties funding. In view of the already\nlarge drop in club funding this year (arts oc and many more!), I find it hard to justify the\nfurther drop in funding that would be\ncaused by the NUS.\nJoining the NUS would also mean handing over a lot of decision-making tasks to\nthem, including the choice of our food and\ndrink providers. This centralisation would\nmean a net increase in the price of drinks,\nespecially beer, by not allowing us to\nchoose the cheapest provider on the mar-ket. Student choice of chocolate would also\nbe greatly restricted as the NUS does not\ntolerate Nestle products for example.\nAs for the benefits, well you might get a reduction at your local cinema- if it didn't already accept your swipe card- when you\ngo home to see your parents and also\ncheaper clothes from Topshop. When it\ncomes to student representation though,\nthe NUS is being ineffective and apathetic.\nOther universities are increasingly thinking\nof leaving because their money is being\nsquandered and the NUS is unaccountable.\nSo what to do? Cinema reductions three\n\n"

IC were\nobviously very fired up for the\nmatch and within the first 5\nminutes were a try up after\nsome poor defending out\nwide. IC were to increase this\nlead shortly after with 2 more\ntries and so after 20 minutes\nwere 17-3 in the lead. The referee made some bizarre decisions in this half most notably\nwhen he ruled out a Medics\ntry claiming that the player's foot had passed the dead ball\nline, this was further compounded by a yellow card to\nthe player for apparent\nover indulgent language. The\nrest of the first half was fairly\nnip and tuck but the Medics\nbacks gained in confidence\nthroughout and after a tentative start began to come to the\nascendancy. The forwards\nwere fairly evenly matched\nwith IC exerting pressure in\nthe scrum s and Medics dominating the line out s. The half-time whistle blew\nwith the score line very much\nin IC favour. The medics\nrealised that last years\nresounding victory was not\nIC Virgins\nWe drove to Guildford in the\nspan gly minibus driven by\nsnotty-posh with stunning\ndriving. Our beautiful head\ncoach, Dave, met us with his\nhome-brew creation, which was evil/lush. The match was\nkw ali ty, and all the training\nfinally paid off, seeing the forwards doing rolling mauls,\nand the backs their slinky\nmoves. Tries were scored by\nGem (x2 due to the good shagging she's getting), Kate\n(slinky roll off a maul), Helen\n(driving over the line and huge\ncelebration for her first try),\nand Alexis (also a Virgin try:\ncapital job).\nCredit goes to Hui Ling for\nnearly scoring three tries, but\nnever managing to convert her\npaz z az into points. Hannah,\nbattling against the elements,\nmanaged one conversion.\nForward of the match goes\nto Dappy, for her good stuff at\nnumber eight, and her consistent support throughout the\nmatch. Back of the match goes\nto Alexis for her first try and\nslinky moves. Huy Ealing was\nnominated for player of the\nmatch by the opposition. Fair\nplay: she had to drink the\nrankest dirty half yard I 've\nseen in my twenty years.\nFresher gets a mention for her\nquestionable taste on the\ndance floor last Wednesday, of\ncourse she knew what she\nwas doing.\nThe ref gets a special mention for having been in\nHollyoaks.

This\nproved to be the spark that\nwas much needed in the team\nand from that moment on the\nMedics raised their game,\nwith IC unable to maintain\npossession due to hard tackling and dominant forward\nloose play. It was only a matter of time before another try\nwas scored and this was\nachieved by the individual\nbrilliance of Nnamdi Obi who\ncoming on at half time made a significant difference to the\noffensive line. The game was\nstill tightly in the balance (15-17) IC clearly did not want to\nlose the match and held on for\n10 minutes before finally their\nresolve gave way.

    "content": "Lady Windermere's Fan\nRoyal Haymarket\nExactly one hundred and ten years after the first time it was performed in London, Oscar Wilde's \"Lady Windermere's Fan\" comes\nback to the capital on the stage of the Royal Haymarket. A giant\nfan hides the Victorian decorated stage, while we wonder what\ncould the people up in the gallery see without opera glasses.\nThe feeling is somewhat as if we were in the wrong place: forget the Barbican's atmosphere, forget the magic of the Royal\nCourt, the feeling of experiencing something new and unigue,\nso pervasive on many of our favourite London's stages. The\nRoyal Haymarket means tradition, classic plays played in the\nclassical manner, and the audience seems to be rather \"class i cal\" as well, and to have survived since.\nAlmost a play around (rather than inside) the play. High society and its rules are the real object of the play, and Wilde's sharp\nblade pierces the veils of conventions to their very core.\nOnce admitted to the highly esteemed Windermere's house\nthe disgraced Mrs Erlynne regains respectability because of that\nsame trait which, before admittance being granted, wouldn't have been conceivable at all; her reputation. Wilde's glamorous\nclaim is that all this conventions are empty and pointless being\nbuilt primarily upon themselves. But then when misunderstanding put Erlynne to the trial, nature proves stronger than interest.\nWe must admit that the casting is absolutely impressive, and in\nparticular the choice of the two pri madonnas. Mother and daughter on the stage as well as in real life, Vanessa Redgrave and\nJoely Richardson are the backbone and the soul of this classic.\nWithout their spontaneity and their freshness the play would\nreally taste cheesy, but they are able to super pose to the comic\nregister the dramatic touch of the guilt of a forsaking mother\nand the awakening to realism of a \"sleeping\" idealistic beauty.\nThe guys this time are not at the level of the girls. Lord\nWindermere is less than convincing - and Darlington is just a bit more lively than a puppet.\nNonetheless the dialogue of the gentlemen late at night in\nlord Darlington's living room is extremely funny: the breathtaking source of so many immortal citations.\nSergio\narts reviews\nHamlet\nICSM Drama Society\nThe ICSM Drama Society staged Shakespeare's Hamlet from the\n26th of February to the 1st of March 2002. It was held at the auspices of the Imperial College Concert Hall, in South Kensington.\nThis shortened version was completely unaltered from\nShakespeare's original script. However, some creative direction,\nwonderful acting, and a glamorous set resulted in a truly entertaining evening.\nThe cast comprised many well-known and seasoned veterans,\nas well as an equal number of fresh young faces. All showed\nmuch talent for their roles. I must mention Hamlet himself, better known as Matt Stevenson, who gave a most unique perform-ance. The rest of the cast were also outstanding, but nobody\ncould deny that he brought something special to the role.\nThe set was well styled and crafted. The sound was appropriate and added to the experience. There was also interesting\nuse of art throughout the performance. For many of the senior\ncast and stage crew, this was their last play - they can retire\nhappily on the back of this truly riveting production.\nAs you would expect from Shakespeare, Hamlet had many\ntwists in the plot and characters, a few surprises (if you didn't already know the story), love and tragedy, family politics, and a very dangerous looking but precisely orchestrated duel scene -this was breath-taking! It even had mini-singing and dancing\npieces, albeit in the mentally unstable states of some of the\ncharacters. Along with this, the comprehensive themes and\nlength, it could rival a modern Bollywood production.\nMental illness was a strong theme in the play, and causes for\nHamlet's mental state were suggested to throughout. In the current age, when recreational drugs and psychotropic substance\nabuse are so rife, the play reminds us that these issues are age\nold, and the consequences they have today are not dissimilar to\nthose of yesterday. Hamlet's sexually charged performance was\nalso interesting as he hinted at maternally-fixated incest. The\nhard work of everybody involved ensured that there was something that everyone could relate in this diligently crafted production from ICSM.\n\n"

    "content": "talk back\nI were to register with a doctor, I think I would register in N7 - if I were too ill to go\nto college and needed to see a doctor, I doubt I'd want to travel 45 minutes by tube\nto college to see one. And if I ever fell ill\nwhile at college and needed to see a doctor\nI certainly hope one would see me even if I were not registered. If someone gets a summer internship and works out of town for\nthe whole summer, I doubt they would register with the doctor in the area. But I could\nguarantee they would be able to see a doctor if they asked at the local surgery or\nhealth centre.\nSo I ask why was I denied the opportunity to see a doctor at the Imperial College\nHealth Centre? I am after all an Imperial\nCollege Student, and am also entitled to\nNHS treatment. If you have been denied\nservice at the Health Centre please write in\nbecause this is not on.\nRegards, Tom Ternent ISE2\nHow Not To...\nDear Will,\nFirstly, I would like to congratulate you on\nyour victory in this year's sabbatical elections. I am certain that you will keep doing\na good job as Felix editor, and I am delighted to continue working with you. May I also\npoint out that I was always planning to\nsubmit this letter, regardless of the result.\nThroughout the whole election process,\nthe conduct of the returning officer and his\nelections committee left much to be\ndesired. To start with, all the dates were\nchanged, which was not only extremely\ninconvenient for those involved, but it also\nmeant that voting would begin just one day\nafter the South Kensington hustings. As a result, Felix was unable to cover hustings\nbefore the start of voting.\nThe hustings at Wye were a complete\nfarce. They were due to begin at 6.30pm, and so our returning officer, in his infinite\nwisdom, decided to leave South Kensington\nat 4.45pm. We eventually arrived over an\nhour late. One of the two minibuses turned\nup about 15 minutes before the other, and\nso the two other candidates for the position\nof Felix editor spoke and received questions\nbefore the minibus I was in had even\narrived. Surely this was unfair, and David\nFrancis should have waited until all the candidates for a particular post were present.\nMr Francis' article in Felix regarding the\nSingle Transferable Vote system was factually incorrect and could have misled stu-dents. The positioning of the ballot boxes\nfor medical students meant that it was\neither very difficult or impossible for many\nsuch students to vote. A significant number\nof students, especially those in Biology, did\nnot even know where their ballot box was.\nI could not believe my ears when the\nelections committee decided to blame us,\nthe candidates, for the low turnout, claiming that it was due to the fact that many of\nus had spent only a small proportion of the\navailable publicity budget. It is down to the\ncommittee to publicise these elections. A candidate, and only a candidate, should\ndecide how much of his/her budget to\nspend. From the results, it seems that there\nis no link whatsoever between publicity\nand victory. Besides, the turnout was\ngreater than last year, with over 10% of students voting. Finally, how can the elections\ncommittee possibly criticise us after Mr\nFrancis' terrible handling of the whole\naffair? I am fully aware that I signed a piece\nof paper saying that the election was con-st it uti on al.I did not complain at the time\nbecause, for reasons including the effect of\nthe election on my degree, the last thing I wanted was for the whole thing to be re-run.\nI am certain that many people involved\nwith the election process will agree with\nmy comments, including most, if not all, of\nthe candidates. Action should be taken\nagainst those involved, if only to prevent a similar situation occurring next year.\nYours &c.

    "content": "club active\nFirsts victorious over UCL\nUCL I23 IC I It was going to be a battle of\ntruly gladiatorial proportions.\nImperial, with a very poor\nstart to the season going\naway to the current league\nleaders and joint favourites\nfor the cup. Still, all that did-n't really matter did it? The\nconditions, as usual for\nShenley, involved a soggy\npitch, force 10 gale, and just\nto spice things up - no refer-ee. So it was that IC kicked\nwith the wind and down the\nhill in the first half.\nAfter an even start, a momentary lapse of concentration at the back allowed\nUCL in behind the IC\ndefence, and suddenly it was\n1-0. A goal down, and playing\nagainst the wind and this tie\njust got a whole lot tougher.\nThis appeared to spur IC on\nand they began to make the\nmost of the wind and slope. A free kick came close, and\nForsythe steered the ball\nwide from in front of goal\nafter a cross from the left.\nNevertheless IC continued to\npush forward, but quality\nchances were at a premium.\nOn the stroke of half-time IC,\nspurred on by coach\nCardines, pressured the UCL left back by his own corner\nflag who was forced into a back pass to his keeper - mistake No. l. Mistake No. 2\ninvolved the keeper air-kick-ing at the ball and watching\nit dribble over his own line,\nbefore smashing it into the\nback of his own net in anger\nand frustration.\nThe second half started as\nbadly for IC as the first half\nhad finished for UCL. Within\nminutes, the UCL right\nwinger hitting a curling left\nfoot shot from the edge of the\nbox that evaded the best\nefforts of keeper Vasquez. 2-1\ndown, uphill and into the\nwind - a whole big world of\ntrouble.\nA period of UCL pressure\ncame to nothing, however,\nand IC began to get the ball\non the deck and stroke it\naround. Mark Curry, an earlier replacement for Anis,\nheard his hamstring do something nasty and was promptly carried off. Nick Jones was\nalso substituted, giving\nAnthony Senner and Seb\nStorbacka a chance. Seb\nbegan to run at the UCL defence and with half an hour\nto go, his efforts paid off.\nTaking the ball on the bounce\nhe rounded the centre back\nbefore firing a left foot (what\nelse?) shot past the UCL keeper. 2-2 and game on\nagain. It was now the turn of\nIC keeper Vasquez to do his\nbit for the cause - a series of\nfantastic clean saves kept IC\nin it, and with ten minutes\nleft a Storbacka through ball\nfound Forsythe, who promptly found the back of the net\nwith his right foot. 3-2, come\non! And so it was down to the\ndefence for the barrage that\nwas to come. Ant Senner was\namazing, as was Joe\nMcMahon and what they did-n't cut out was dealt with by\nCowley, Bureau and of course\n- Vasquez. After an eternity,\nthe final whistle blew and the\nleague leaders were out -well the cup isn't the cup\nthese days without IC is it?\nBowling Oxford Tour\nThe IC Tenpin Bowling Club\nrecently attended the annual\nULU Masters event, a Scratch\nand Handicap singles tournament open to all UL U bowlers.\nIt proved a very successful\nday, with IC bringing home 10\nof the 13 trophies on offer.\nThe first round saw Tim\nHarbour and Gray Johnston\nqualify in first and second\nplace in the Scratch division,\nwith Jez and Trevor qualifying\nfirst and third in the Handicap\ndivision. A further 9 IC students also qualified further\ndown the rankings.\nTim and Gray then progressed to the stepladder final\nin first and second place, with\nKevin keeping up his good\nform to take the fourth place.\nIn the Handicap section,\nTrevor won two of his matches\nto seed him 3rd in the stepladder final, whilst Jez qualified\nin fourth.\nJez beat Trevor to a place in\nthe 2nd place match, which he\nunfortunately lost and so finished in third, with a trophy\nfor the highest game of the\nday (215).\nIn the Scratch section, Kevin\neasily saw off his first opponent but was not good enough\nto defeat Gray, who progressed to the final to meet\nTim. Four consecutive strikes\nin the final frames saw Tim\ncome back and magnificently\ntake the title with a189 game.\nTim also took home the High\nScratch Average trophy, and\nDany and Ally picked up the\nLadies High Game and Ladies\nHigh Average awards in the\nScratch and Handicap section,\nrespectively.\nChris\nThe official Oxford Tour began\non a sunny, blue skied\nSaturday morning. With a little help from Anna's bacon\nbut ties and Tina's not so dangerous driving we arrived in\nOxford feeling ugly enough to\nplay the Oxford seconds\nDespite the lashing hail\nstones and fierce winds, a recovering ankle and a bout of\nviral meningitis among the\nteam, the IC \"freezing ugly\nbitches\" gave the Oxford's seconds team and a half a good\ngame.\nThe game ended 2-0 to the\nmighty Oxford seconds, but\nwe'll have them next year! The\nevening fun began with hall\ndinner with Sunday's opp osi tion, St Catherine's. We did IC\nproud, and totally ruled the\ndance floor, guys were falling\nat our feet (no literally! -it was\nthat kind of night!). Chips and\ngarlic mayo ended the night,\nunfortunately for Saz and not\nso regrettably for others, with\nTina's night time companion\nbeing a TV, which obviously\ndoesn't object to garlic!\nSunday's game was crazy,\nwith defence playing attack\nand attack and mid field\nmixed up all over the shop\n(god we're such jokers!), we\npulled off a good score of 5-3!\nAfter some not so delicious\nshan dies from St Catheriine's we made our way home, via a Guinness and some crisps,\nand the weekend was almost\nperfect!\nWe might not be ugly\nenough to beat the Oxford\nseconds, but we sure can\nshake our too sh on the dance\nfloor!\nSarah\n\n"

(Page 18)\nElection Result Uncertainty\nThe results of recent sabbatical elections\nare in danger of being overturned after a formal complaint was made by the\nPresident of the Medics' Union.\nThe Medics' President, Shazia Munir,\npresented her argument on Tuesday, where\nshe alleged that the election had been run\nunfairly. This followed a formal complaint\nwhich was sell o taped to the office door of\nReturning Officer David Francis last\nSaturday, the day of the count. Sellotape is\nnot, apparently, a valid way to make a formal complaint, and the count proceeded\nunhindered - the results of which were\nannounced on Monday (see page 5).\nWhile the Returning Officer for sabbatical elections is usually the President, this\nyear'sen cum bent, Sen Ganesh, stood for\nre-election. David Francis acted as\nReturning Officer in his place until a meeting of Union Council confirmed that he\ncould run the elections. This decision was\ntaken despite informal complaints about\nhis conduct during the nomination of can-di dates, implying that those now rec rui red to judge his conduct were aware of diss at Medical Union President: Complaint\nis faction before they appointed him.\nThe substance of Ms Munir's complaint\nregards the placement and limited number\nof ballot boxes on medical campuses, as\nwell as criticism of the \"lack of notice\"\ngiven for students wishing to register their\nvote remotely.\nMr Francis, who is heavily criticised in\nthe complaint, argues that Ms Munir failed\nto communicate the proxy voting arrangements to her student body in time, and that\nthe Elections Committee had moved ballot\nboxes on the medical campuses in accordance with Ms Munir's requests.\nIf these complaints are upheld at subsequent meetings, the elections may be\nentirely re-run.\nIt has been alleged that this enthusiasm\nfor re-running the election may be related\nto fourth year medic Idris Harding's narrow\ndefeat in the Presidential election. Mr Harding overwhelmingly beat all the other\ncandidates in the medic vote with a medic\nturn-out greater than in any other depart-ment, excluding the Huxley ballot which\ncontains three departments. This casts\ndoubt on the effect poor voting arrangements may have had on the outcome.\nThe recent elections cost the Union over\n\u00a31000 - enough to kit out a Rugby team -but there are also significant worries that\nthe student population would fail to turn\nout for a repetition of the elections.

The muddy\nfield we parked our vehicles in\nrapidly turned into a scene\nfrom a Christmas postcard; all\nof us looking like snowmen!\nWe sought refuge in the clubhouse from the blizzard, with\nonly a cup of tea to warm us.\nDespite high winds and sporadic snowing our spirits were\nhigh; the poor conditions\nbrought all the teams to an\neven footing. The competition\nconsisted of 7 traps releasing a total of 50 clays per person\n(200 clays per team!) and a hundred bird flush. Each person from a team shot each of\nthe 7 traps, and the scores of\neach individual were totalled\nto get the team score. In the\nimmensely enjoyable, but chal-leng ing, hundred bird flush the\nentire team stood in a row as a100 clays were launched over\ntheir heads. The whole team\nopened fire and tried to shoot\nas many of the clays as p ossi ble! The score from the flush\nwas added to the team's score\ngiving a total out of 300.\nAt the end of the afternoon,\nour shooting over, we made\nour way to the clubhouse to\nreceive our scores:\nThe A team did well with a total score of 171 giving them\n12th place out of 41, while the\nB team arrived in 22ndp osi tion. The C team, came 29th with their score of 101, and\nfinally, the Ladies' team, shot a score of 72, giving them 39th place, although they came 6th out of all the ladies' teams.\nSpecial mention must be\ngiven to Guy as he got one of\nthe top 5 best individual scores\nin the whole competition.\nIf you think your good\nenough, if no one else can help\nyou and if you can find us in\nthe rifle range in the IC Sports\nCentre (Wednesday and\nSaturday afternoons), maybe\nyou can join the Rifle Club.\nAnthony Meisner\nFoiled Again!\nOverall this year we came top\nof the south eastern league by\nthree points. This is a fantastic achievement and the first\ntime since I have been cap-tain. Both Leucha and Witolda\nhave improved a great deal\nthis year and this really\nshowed in the matches with\nsome well executed hits.\nSadly one of our usual play-ers, Camille, was unable, to\nmake many of the matches\ndue to a most unfortunate\nknee injury, however she was\nable to fence in the final\nmatch against UCL which\nsecured our victory in the\nleague.\nIC Ladies 76 85 Cambridge\nHaving won the league we\nthen drew Cambridge for the\nlast sixteen match.\nCambridge were an exceptionally strong team, with six\nplayers to our three just for\nstarters! In the e pee, the three\ninternationals outclassed our\nteam who are not strictly\ne pee is ts, so we lost 45-31.\nHowever in the foil we managed to hold our own to obtain\na deserved win. Unfortunately\nthis was not enough for an\noverall victory. Although we\nwere losing initially in the foil,\nKatherine (captain) managed\nto pull the score up to 30-29\nfrom the losing 18-25. This\ngave the whole team the\nimpetus to carry on the winning streak. The final foil score\nwas 45-40. This retains our\nrecord of only losing one foil\nmatch this term, and this was\nagainst Reading who, again,\nhad many internationals in\ntheir team.\nMII pepsi 1\n1\n6\n0\nml) with every\n\u00a32.75lunch special\n\u2014 Cafe bar \u2022 \u2014\nimperial\n\u2022 college\nunion CATERING\n\n"

Besides, an\nNUS card is perfectly simple to obtain\nthrough ULU!\nGive me a cheap pint, any day!\nAnonymous\nEast Meets Controversy\nDear Felix.\nI recently took part in East Meets West\n2002 and the show was fantastic. However,\nthe current ICU President was there causing what seemed to be a hell of a lot of trouble over nothing.\nDramsoc reported that Sen entered their\ncontrol room and asked that the show be\ndelayed. Bizarre. As to the reasons, he himself said it was because he wanted people\nto go home and not go to the after show party due to his 'fire-safety' concerns. I know, I was there when he said it. I find it\nhard to believe that the President did not\nknow WEEKs in advance the numbers coming to see the show. Either he was being\ncompletely incompetent or he came down\njust trying to cause trouble.\nI find it disgusting that an official of the\nUnion (indeed, the President) would come\ndown alone and prevent nearly 75 students\nentry to their own after show party. When\nother officers of the Union came out to tell\nhim that their must have been a miscount,\nhe refused to believe them and still prevented entry. Does this not seem a bit irrational? I'm also surprised that Sen Ganesh had\ntime to persecute the Indian Societythere's me thinking he had a constitution to\nre-draft.\nSamit Ahir\nThere were two other letters written that\nwere very similar to this, so-have not been\nincluded due to space.\nMentally Challenged\nHave you been watching University\nChallenge on TV this year? Thrilled at the\ndaring escapades of the four intrepid crusaders as they see off the challenges from\nall comers? Thought that you could do bet-ter?\nWell, you now have a chance to do even\nbetter. There will be hustings for the 'new*\nteam, for the 2002-2003 quiz season, on\nThursday the 14th of March, at 1pm, in\nSeminar Room 7B in the East Basement of\nthe Union. This will consist of a series of\nquestions on all sorts of subjects, designed\nto test your potential as a contestant.\nThe only constraint on you is that you\nhave to be a student next year.\nAny questions to l.k ilford@ ic.ac.uk.\n\"Imperial, Kilford\".\nGardening Hour\nDear Felix,\nDue to remarks by the Rector (reported in\nissue 1225), it was brought to our attention\nthat Garden Hall will be sold soon. To the\nbest of our knowledge Montpellier and\nBrabazon will also be closed and we question the logic of closing cheap accommodation close to college.\nThe lack of information from the Union to\nthe student body suggests that the Rector\nhas their full support. The Union is meant\nto be an open institution that informs and\nexplains both their own and college's decisions - decisions which affect the student\npopulation now and in the future. However,\nthey are pre-occupied arguing amongst\nthemselves over issues the majority of students don't know and don't care about.\nThe closure of Garden Hall and others will\naffect the student population, and ultimately the colleges' (both in terms of reputation\nand research), negatively. The logic behind\nclosing a hall on campus evades us.\nHaving to commute to college will isolate\nfirst year students from both the Union and\ncollege, reducing their participation in\nactivities and their degrees.\nNot all students can afford the high price\nof single en-suite rooms - especially with\nthe added costs of travel on the increasingly expensive underground. Garden provides\ncheap accommodation to a large number of\nstudents who would not other be able to\nattend Imperial. Is Imperial going to\nbecome Yuppy Central?\nOf the 84 students at Garden Hall, most of\nthe students that live in shared rooms thoroughly enjoy the experience. Not only do\noverseas students (who already pay\n\u00a312,000 in fees) find it cheaper to stay at\nGarden, but they also find it easier to mix\nwith British students. There is nothing like\nsharing a room to get to know someone\nfrom a different culture.\nWhy are college planning to sell a hall\nthat has just been renovated to renovate\nanother? Why not sell Beit in 5 years to\nrefurbish the other halls?\nGarden is the most luxurious hall in college and looks stunning inside and out. If\nyou don't believe that, take our challenge\nand visit. This invitation is extended to\nunion officers, college management,\nestates, or anyone else involved with the\nclosure.\nAll we have been informed of is the closure of the hall, without any solid reasons.\nAll we ask of the college and Union is to\ngive us an explanation of why they plan to\ndo this. From our viewpoint, it is certainly\nno good for the students, and surely the\nUnion, and hopefully the college, is here for\nthe students? Or is ranking higher than\nother colleges in terms of research becoming a higher priority?\nAhmed & Jude (Garden Hall Residents)\nHealth Concerns\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to complain about the IC\nHealth Centre. Last week I had a spare hour\none morning and, needing a consultation\nwith a doctor, decided to go along to the\nOpen Clinic' in the morning. I know I'm not\nregistered with a doctor there, nor with a doctor in London, but should be able to see\na doctor as a temporary visiting patient.\nUpon asking if I at reception if I could be\nseen in the Open Clinic, I was told I had to\nregister with a doctor at the Health Centre.\nI then informed the receptionist I didn't wish to register at this moment in time, and\nonly needed a short consultation with a doctor. After asking my postcode (N7), she\ninformed me that I was in their catchment\narea and therefore HAD to register if I wanted to see a doctor. The last time I checked\nwith a GP in my family, no person has to\nregister with a doctor to see one, but it is\npreferred if the patient is staying in the area\nfor a long period of time. According to\nHealth Centre literature, they recommend\npatients should register with them \"if they\nare staying in the area for over three\nmonths.\". Last time I checked, an eleven\nweek term is shorter than three months,\nand most undergraduates go home for the\nsummer.\nRegardless of this fact, N7 is about 45\nminutes away from South Kensington, so if\n\n"

So what can I say about this\nsong? Well, it's AllG, and if you like him then you're going to\nlove this track just for the comedy value. Shaggy doesn't do\nmuch, apart from his customary nonsensical rap. Ali's not as\nclever as he used to be, but this is funny stuff.\nID Oscar\nBRANCACCI O& AISHER - It's Gonna Be (A Lovely Day)\nYet another classy house track from The Annual 2002. As\nusual, it's done the rounds in the clubs for ages before finally\nbeing released. With a sample from C&C Music Factory, It's Gonna Be does the job but isn't particularly memorable. Track\nthree, the Bedrock vocal mix, provides an interesting take on the\noriginal, with a slightly more chilled-out vibe.\nDave\nGOLDRUSH Pioneers EP Goldrush's label-mates include The Rock Of Travolta, Dustball\nand Six Ray Sun, and so I wanted to like this EP a lot.

Afterwards, he was immediately picked up by the Def\nSoul label. The song begins with him saying \"yeah\" repeatedly,\nwhich makes me wonder whether he's trying to impersonate\nCraig David.

    "content": "music reviews\nDeparture Lounge\nToo Late To Die Young\nOut now on Bella Union records\nThe British four-piece return with a pop\nrecord produced by French DJ and multi-instrumentalist Kid Loco. Too Late To Die\nYoung is the third Departure Lounge\nalbum and the follow-up to their instrumental project Jetlag Dreams.\nTim Keegan, singer and songwriter,\nappeared on last year's Kid Loco record\nKill Your Darlings, and the co-operation\nbetween the two helps to extend the\ndreamlike atmospheres developed on the\nband's first two albums. We can still find\nsensual melodies and sweet choruses (I Love You), even if we also discover a new\ngroovy element (King Kong Frown).\nThe most interesting tracks are those\nwhere the emphasis is placed on the\ninstruments rather than the vocals.\nMany, such as the pretty scheming\nTubular Belgians In My Goldfield and the\nbluesy Coke and Flakes, could have been\nwritten for film soundtracks.\nAnd what about the rest of the record?\nActually, it's not bad. Quite good, in fact,\nbut something has bothered me after\neach listen. The tracks sound good, but\nperhaps too good: the production seems\ntoo careful. As a result, the album sounds\ntoo pop and too \"easy listening\" for me.\nIndeed, Departure Lounge don't create a very innovative style of music. I would\nprefer more bugs in the production and\nless perfect pop songs (What You Have Is\nGood is catchy but not really exciting).\nIn conclusion, if you enjoy beautiful,\nclassic pop music, then don't wait - run\nand buy this record! But if you are interested in musical discoveries and new\nsounds, then you might want to try\nsomething else...\nHoobastank\nHoobastank\nOut now on Mercury records\nI used to be into metal. Many moons ago,\nbefore I came to university, I went to\nSepultura concerts; the whole lot. Luckily\nin my opinion, this affliction didn't progress to its final stages. After many\nyears of listening to house music and the\nlike, the closest I have come to metal of\nlate is a Travis CD - not exactly Slayer's Reign In Blood, I think you'll agree.\nStill, the rise of poorly-spelt nu-metal\nhas not escaped me. One thing that differs about metal in more recent times is\nthe number of women who like it. Back in\nthe day, concerts were like Elec Eng\nsocials, but now the numbers are almost\neven. Only today, I overheard a couple of\nteenage girls excited by the fact that\nSlipknot were on the cover of Metal\nHammer. Quite how they know that a man who is only seen in public wearing\na mask is \"gorgeous\" is beyond me.\nBut what has all this got to do with\nHoobastank, you ask. Well, Hoobastank\nrock big time. From the opening chords,\ndisplaying the fantastic crunch tone that\nbedroom guitarists spend thousands trying to imitate, you know that this album\nis going to be special. The vocals may\nnot be up to Pavarotti standards, but who\ncares when the rest is so good?'There's nothing particularly complex or subtle in\ntheir arrangements, but they set out with\nthe sort of muscular punk y rock style that\njust speaks for itself.\nThere hasn't been a better new rock\nband since Therapy? If there is any sort\nof justice in the world, Hoobastank will\nbe crowned kings of nu-metal and show\nthose upstarts Linkin Park how it really\nshould be done.\nBeverley Knight\nWho I Am\nOut this Monday on Parlophone records\nThe self-assured ambassador for\nWolverhampton's almost non-existent\nmusic scene returns with this long\nawaited, slickly produced follow-up to\nProdigal Sista.\nWho I Am is one of the most promising\nalbums I 've heard this year, full of emotion and character. However, it is unable\nto reach the higher echelons of the hall of\nfame of musical royalty.\nThe opening track is the brilliant Get\nUp, which had me dancing in circles due\nto its infectious rhythms and seductive\nvocals. I don't want it to end. Track two,\nthe likeable, mature recent single\nShoulda Woulda Coulda, begins in a manner similar to that of the excellent Turin\nBrakes on their inspirational track The\nUnderdog. When the chorus kicks in,\npleasant guitar strumming and Knight's soulful voice bring an almost mediocre\nset of lyrics to life.\nIt is when R&B sensibilities take hold\nthat this album is immensely appealing.\nUnfortunately though, this doesn't happen very often.\nHighlights include Beautiful\nContradiction, with its soaring vocals,\nand the smooth, slow R&B number\nHurricane Jane. Erykah Badu's influences come through effectively on the\ngospel-tinged Same, and Whatever's Clever features Misteeq-style vocals.\nWho I Am is Knight's best work, built\nupon strong lyrics and a very powerful\nvoice. The chart success of the first two\nsingles, Get Up and Shoulda Woulda\nCoulda, suggests that this may be the\nalbum that brings her music to the\nmasses.\nFrangois Alex Sajini\n\n"

All good you may say, and we would\nagree, but for reasons unknown the bureaucratic monolith that is IC Union decided\nthat Wine Tasting falls into the \"un accept able funding\" pigeon hole, resulting in the\ndeath of the society last September. So after\na period of silence on the WT front, enter the\nRCSU, astride a white horse offering just\nenough funding to overcome the inertia and\nget the society moving again.\nSo, the first question you may ask is why\ngo to all this hassle just to drink wine, we\ndon't need an excuse to get drunk, let alone\none with such pretentious connotations... I would first point out (and I cannot stress\nthis enough), we are not a society aimed at\ngetting drunk! Anyone can drink wine, it's simply a case of tilting the glass and s wal lowing, what we aim to teach our members\nis the art of \"tasting\" the wine, a fantastic\nchallenge requiring keen concentration, a good memory and a vivid imagination.\nTasting involves plunging into the depths of\nthe wine, unmasking a wealth of information and revealing an extra dimension to\nwhat is so often a routine event.\nIn a usual wine tasting event, we taste\nabout 6-8 different wines of a specific theme\n(region, style etc.). The tasting is guided by\nan external expert, who introduces us to the\nindividual wines, explaining their characteristics and how they relate to the creation al process. We aim to hold tasting s approximately every two weeks, this\nshould allow us to cover a wide range of\nstyles of wine and provide our members\nwith a solid introduction to the world of\nwine. Tastings last approximately two\nhours and will cost around six pounds\n(although we do hope to do some for free,\nlater on in the year). We also hold tasting s of whisky, port and champagne, although\nthese are seen as extras to our primary aim\nof tasting wine. If any of this interests you,\nour first event is to be held on the 12th of\nMarch, the unmissable \"Introduction to\nWine Tasting\". You will be told how to drink,\nhow to smell, what to look at and which\ncharacteristics of a wine are important as\nwe taste eight wines (4 red, 4 white) especially chosen to exemplify the differences\npossible between wines.
