    "content": "Enjoy your stay in Lithu-Mania!\nVilnius, churches, stomachs, lastminute.com, zeppelins, The Gorgon and some truly awful photography\nThe absinthe sits on the alcohol-sputtered bar, flaming menacingly,\nacrid scent clawing at the backs\nof our mouths. Jim Morrison sits\nto my right, the tassels from his\nmaroon poncho coiled on the bar,\nhis eyes dull from too much wheat\nbeer. On the left is the huge, bulk of\na man called Gorgon, bearded with\nflowing, tangled hair, swaying on the\nbar stool, mumbling to himself in an\nodd Lithuanian-English hybrid. We\nare all flanked on both sides by unknown beauties, like the exquisite\nseraphs in a Rubens masterpiece.\nWe wonder to ourselves where they\npossibly could have come from,\nhow they are genetically possible,\nhow we can get to know them? Suddenly The Gorgon lets out a wail\nnot dissimilar to that made popular\nby Chewbacca in Star Wars, downs\na still flaming absinthe, wails once\nmore and then collapses in a heap\non the floor, soundless now.\n\u2018Is he ok?\u2019 I ask Jim Morrison.\nJim turns his head with all the\nnonchalance of a 1960s West-Coast\nrock star. \u2018Gorgon,\u2019 he hisses, \u2018Gorgon!\u2019 Nothing. Jim turns back to\nme and in his affected American\naccent, peppered with Baltic vowels and the guttural sounds of his\ntrue home nation, he says simply:\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, man. He does this\nsometimes.\u2019 We turn back to our\nabsinthes, forgetting The Gorgon,\nprostrate on the mucky floor, probably wailing in his drunken dreams.\nThe above is no hallucination. It\nonly took six days in Vilnius for an\nunconscious giant to become an\naxiomatic part of our evenings out,\nbut more of that later.\nGetting to Vilnius is an event best\nleft to lovers of fear. It begins in the\narse-end of Gatwick airport, the end\nreserved for drug-smuggler\u2019s cavity searchers and the huge vaults\ncontaining those pointless chew-able toothbrushes which make you\nlong for times past when miserable\nhalitosis was perfectly acceptable.\nIt takes eight hours to get there\nand you need a Sherpa to guide you\non the last ascent through beige,\npiss-smelling corridors covered in\nthe detritus of discarded chewable\ntoothbrushes. Gatwick does not\nlike Lithuanians. When the gate is\nfinally reached, when you lumber\nover to the stained window to take\none last look at grey old England,\nthe metal tube about to take you\nmiles into the air at speed comes\ninto view. At this moment you feel\nan almost brotherly understanding\nwith those about to go over the top\nin Flanders\u2019s Fields back in 1917.\nFlyLal planes look similar to something Neil Buchanan might have\nwhipped up in fifteen minutes on\nArt Attack. In fact, I think I would\nhave had more confidence if that\nScouse monstrosity had had a hand\nin the aerospace engineering of\nFlyLal\u2019s fleet. The plane is cracked\nand wizened, garish colours painted\nover holes and indents, looking all\nthe while like some seaside funfair\nattraction, inspiring no confidence\nin its ability to move, let alone fly.\nThe interior (brave enough to venture inside, you see) rests in an\nepoch where safety was of concern\nto no-one, when jutting metal was\na design feature and seats which\ndidn\u2019t spontaneously collapse were\nthe feature on that Friday\u2019s \u2018Tomorrow\u2019s World.\u2019 Three hours of creak-ing, sputtering, high-decibel bangs\nand warm beer, however, we land in\nan airport more closely resembling\na farm than an E.U destination.\nWelcome to Vilnius.\nArmed with Lonely Planet guile\nwe already know the taxi driver\u2019s\ngame. Famous for cheating the\nforeigners, don\u2019t accept anything\nmore than 20 Litas to the centre.\nWe are prepared for haggling, for\nfinancial dancing akin to Rocky\nand Apollo going at it in Rocky II.\nWithin two minutes our \u2018know-how\u2019\nhad precipitated a fight between a\ngroup of colossal taxi drivers and\nour bags had been launched at us\nat high velocity. Don\u2019t listen to people from Lonely Planet. They are\nthe kind of folk that end up dismembered in a bin in Guatemala. Just\npay for things. With the exchange\nrate in Lithuania, an estate to rival\nAbramovich\u2019s best only costs about\nfour quid anyway.\nNow before I take you through the\nbaroque majesty of Old Vilnius, the\ncastles, courtyards and most individual of culinary ideals, allow me a\nsection reserved solely for bile and\nspewed anger.

    "content": "Letters to the editor\nThe first batch of complaints have hit our inbox, driven mainly\nby the ex-editor\u2019s letter and the slightly snappy response\nDear Editor,\nI was a bit disappointed to read\nyour reply to Rupert Neate\u2019s letter\nin the last Felix. Okay, his letter was\nrather confrontational, and indeed\nsome lesser editors would probably\nnot have had the balls to publish it,\nbut I take issue with your comment\nthat your editorial was \u201cbacked up\nby the opinion of the general College population\u201d. In fact, pretty\nmuch everyone I know in College\nthinks that this year\u2019s Felix has by\nand large been less interesting and\nenjoyable to read than last year\u2019s.\nPossibly this is due to us only having seen the first few issues, but\nthere is an almost universal opinion\namongst Felix-readers that whilst\nthis year\u2019s may on the whole be\nbetter written, with fewer spelling\nmistakes and grammatical errors,\nit is simply less interesting and\nentertaining than last year\u2019s Felix.\nThe news doesn\u2019t seem very press-ing, possibly because there\u2019s not\nmuch about, but more importantly\nthe rest of the newspaper just takes\nitself too seriously and does not really have any light-hearted, \u2018enjoyable\u2019 stuff in, perhaps forgetting\nthat it is a student newspaper and\nnot the Financial Times.\nMy opinion is that you can only\naim as high, culturally, as the quality of your writing can allow and un-fortunately, due to the nature of our\nuniversity, writers of quality content are in short supply, so aiming\ntoo high culturally can easily result\nin ending up being plain boring.\nRegards,\nChris Thomas\nPS I won\u2019t be too surprised if you\ndon\u2019t publish any of this letter, but\nI hope you take the opinion on\nboard.\nWe liked the\nold Felix better\nDear Editor,\nI feel compelled to write to you\nabout your response to Rupert\nNeate\u2019s letter (Page 8, Felix 1361).\nThe comment that your previous editorial about last year\u2019s Felix \u201cbacked up the feelings of the\ngeneral population of the college\u201d\nseems completely at odds with my\nown experiences. As a fourth year\nstudent, I can say that Felix under\nMr Neate was a far more entertaining read than it had been previous-ly. Furthermore, I have yet to speak\nto anyone who disagrees with this\nsentiment. In contrast, I am somewhat unimpressed this year with\nfront page stories about your own\ngraduation.\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s too early in the year\nto judge your own editorial skills,\nbut it would be a good idea to learn\nfrom your predecessors success\nrather than to belittle it.\nRegards,\nJohn Lyle\nAndy Sykes, Editor, writes:\nDear Chris and John,\nOf course I\u2019d print your letter, Chris;\nit is not in my interest to censor bad\nfeeling about the newspaper.\nAs all the letters about my response were negative, I will admit\nthat my viewpoint seems to be in\nthe minority. I, of course, saw things\nfrom a different angle, working for\nthe newspaper and having been\ninvolved in Felix for many years. I\nadmire Rupert\u2019s courage in taking\non both the College and the Union,\nbut I believe on several occasions\nhe far overstepped the mark. Many\nstudents did not know what happened behind the scenes, such the\ndissatisfaction within the editorial\nteam about the editor\u2019s management style.\nYou do go on to make a counter-statement that is as broadly sweeping as my own. In my defence, I\u2019ve\nhad a number of people approach\nme and say they\u2019re enjoying the\npaper more now than previously,\nand a number approach me and say\nthe exact opposite. I think and hope\nthat we\u2019re slowly improving; I was\nstill recruiting team members until\nrecently.\nTo deal with your second point\nabout entertaining content - I unfortunately lost the beloved Hoff\nthis year, as he has graduated, and\nhis replacement hasn\u2019t been able\nto work due to excessive commit-ments. I\u2019m working hard to restore\nsomething on a par with the Hoff,\neven if it isn\u2019t outwardly visible. As\nthe new staff grow more confident,\nso their sections become more\ninteresting.\nAs to the graduation photo story,\nwell, I didn\u2019t do it. I was, obviously,\ngraduating as the paper was coming\nout, so I handed over what I could to\nmy deputy editors. When I finished\nthe front page on Wednesday, it\nwas the Tibetan protest outside the\nhotel in Kensington High Street.\nWhen I returned on Thursday, it\nhad changed to a photo of myself\nlooking like a complete moron.\nThe news in College and the Union has been somewhat slow of late,\nas I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed; there\u2019s\nnot much I can do about that, I\u2019m\nafraid.\nWhat really riles me, and what\nChris has pointed out, is that I am\nnot responsible for the content of\nthe newspaper even though I am\ngenerally held to account for it.\nMy entire life is spent in the office,\nmore or less, but I cannot write eve-rything. The bottom line is: you provide the content. If you\u2019re not happy\nwith something, come and speak to\nme. I\u2019m always ready to hear new\nideas.\nAs for the comment about learning from my predecessors - that is\nexactly what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve been\ninvolved long enough, and seen\nfour editors come and go, to pick up\nknowledge and skills.\nI hope you find this issue more\nenjoyable.\nDo you have an\nopinion about\nFelix in general,\nor do you have a\ngrievience that you\nwish to air?\nWrite to us:\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nWe print all letters\nreceived.

The initial\nplans, which were the subject of\ndiscussion amongst College Security and receptionists, involved the\nclosure of twelve out of the fifteen\nreception desks around campus,\nwith two more being converted into\n\u2018concierge positions\u2019. In the buildings where reception desks were\nto be removed, turnstiles activated\nby swipe cards were to be installed,\nsimilar to the ones in the newly\ncompleted Chemistry entrance.\nThis meant that visitors to one of\nthe buildings with turnstiles would\nbe directed to a central desk in the\nSherfield Building where a member\nof staff from the desk or the destination department would take the\nvisitor to the correct building and\ngive them access.\nThe revised plans are somewhat\nsimilar, with seven desks remain-ing: the College Main Entrance,\nthe Chemistry & Biochemistry\nbuilding, the Blackett Lab (Phys-ics entrance), the Faculty Building,\nthe Huxley Building, the Skempton Building and the Sir Alexander\nFleming Building. The external\nfacing entrances will be swipe card\naccess only; these are the Royal\nSchool of Mines entrance, the Huxley entrance at 180 Queens Gate,\nand the Aeronautical Engineering\nentrance. These entrances will only\nbe accessible to students who study\nin these departments, apart from\nthe Aero entrance, which will permit any student with a swipe card.\nThe loss of reception desks means\nthat extra staff are likely to be taken on to deal with the extra mail.\nWhereas post was previously left in\nthe reception areas of buildings by\npostal staff, it will now be delivered\ndirectly to the department itself, resulting in \u201can improved postal service\u201d. Couriers will also be directed\nto new drop-off points, varying with\ndepartment.\nFelix has learned that plans to install more of the swipe card access\nturnstiles in buildings are under\nconsideration. The turnstiles are\nmonitored with CCTV, and only allow access to students and staff\nwho work inside that particular\nbuilding. Jumping the gates should\ntrigger alarms, and Security can\nlocate the jumper by viewing the\nCCTV footage. Turnstiles are likely\nto be added to the Queen\u2019s Gate and\nPrince Consort Road entrances by\nJanuary.\nWhen the plans were proposed\nduring the summer, they were met\nwith criticism from some inhabitants of the campus. Some suggested that they would make collaboration across departments difficult, as\nfreedom of movement from building\nto building would be restricted. Ceri\nDavis, Head of Security, has said\nthat the final decision on who would\nbe allowed access to the building\nCollege closes reception desks around South Kensington campus\nwould depend on what the managers of the building wanted, and\nthat despite the buildings being on\nswipe-controlled access 24 hours a\nday, College Security has no problem allowing all students and staff\naccess to all the buildings.\nThough Mr Davis has promised\nproximity readers for turnstiles,\nthe ones in the Chemistry Entrance\nare magnetic strip only, and have\nproved somewhat problematic,\nbeing slow to reset on occassion.\nHowever, the concierge position allows congestion to be bypassed by\nopening the glass gates.\nThe overall aim of the plans is to\nimprove the security of South Kensington campus, and to centralise\nvisitor access. However, the promised closure of Imperial College\nRoad, and turnstile placement at all\nentrances of the campus are probably a fair way off since both Westminster and the Royal Borough\nCouncils must agree, and may also\ndepend on the long-term plan of pe-destrainising Exhibition Road.\nElections complete\nThis year\u2019s Council elections are\ncomplete, with results being announced at Thursday lunchtime,\nbut not without the usual share of\nsilliness, farce, and mistakes.\nDespite being announced as \u201cthe\nmost successful Council Elections\nturn-out ever\u201d, the average turnout was only 7.2%. This is likely attributable to the lack of campaigning of most candidates, as most of\nthem were standing unopposed by\nanyone but Re-Open Nominations\n(RON). The highest turn-out was in\nthe Faculty of Medicine, with 12.3%\nof undergraduates coming out to\nvote for their counsellors.\nNotable victors from the elections\nwere: Ashley Brown, the editor of\nLive! (CGCU online newspaper,\nlive.cgcu.net), who was elected as\nPostgraduate Engineering Counsellor; Alex Guite, the leader of the\nNUS Yes campaign, who was elected as Postgraduate Natural Science\ncounsellor; and Andy Sykes, the Felix editor, who was elected as NonFaculty Counsellor, a rather odd\nposition that represents less than\n100 students in the College, including those in the Tanaka Business\nSchool and the sabbs themselves.\nDespite heavy email campaigning by John Collins, the Union\nPresident, some positions remain\nunfilled, and will have to be elected\nat the next Council meeting. An \u2018administrative error\u2019 lead to the Welfare Campaigns Officer not being\nincluded on the website form for\nvoting or standing, leaving prospective officers confused. This position\nwill also by elected at Council.\nAs reported two weeks ago, hustings in the JCR proved as farcical as usual, with most students\nonly paying attention when RON\n(Stephen Brown) took to the stage.\nNonetheless, any increase in voter turn-out for what is often seen\nas the \u201chacks\u2019 elections\u201d is to be\ncommended.\nThe magnetic strip turnstiles in the new Chemistry entrance\nStudent\u2019s death in Beit Hall\nAn undergraduate maths student\nwas found dead in his room in Beit\nHall on Tuesday.\nThe alarm was raised by the student\u2019s mother, who had not been\nable to contact her son. The war-dening staff acted immediately and\ngained access to his room, then\ncalled paramedics and the police.\nThe cause of death is being investigated by the police. The student\nhad previously suffered from epilepsy however.\nThe student\u2019s parents have been\ninformed of the tragedy, and a College tutor is currently supporting\nthem, along with the Warden of Beit\nQuad.

It is important especially\nat this time of year when the clocks have gone back and the\ndark nights are drawing in that students are aware of their\nsurroundings.\nThe Information and Advice Centre can help if you have any\nconcerns regarding personal safety. We can give out free personal\nattack alarms as well as give free booklets to students which can\ngive you common sense advice when walking the streets at night.\nBelow are a few quick tips for you to take on board:\n\u2022 If you are going out make sure you know where you are going\nand have a planned route. It is good practice to tell people where\nyou are going if you travelling on your own.\n\u2022 When walking around look con\ufb01dent, be purposeful and be\nalert to your surroundings. People who look con\ufb01dent are less\nlikely to be attacked.\n\u2022 Try to avoid taking shortcuts through dark alleywas or parks, as\nthis will increase the amount of risk you will be in as it will often\nbe hard to see what is around you.\n\u2022 Try not to draw attention to your valuables especially at night, keep\nthings like mobile phones and iPods well hidden from people.\n\u2022 Avoid walking past parked cars with their engines running and\npeople sitting in them.\n\u2022 If you are travelling by bus try to sit near the driver, or if by\ntrain try to sit in a busy carriage.\nIt is also important to be aware, when you are trying to get\nhome late at night, of the transport you are getting into, London\nhas quite a big problem with\nunlicensed mini-cabs.\n\u2022 If you are stranded somewhere\nand need to take a taxi, ensure\nthat you use a licensed mini cab\nor licensed black taxi.\n\u2022 It is always better to book a taxi\nin advance rather than trying to\nhail one late at night.\n\u2022 If you can, try to share a cab\nhome with friends.\n\u2022 Con\ufb01rm the details of the cab driver before entering the car to\nensure it actually is your cab.\n\u2022 Make sure you sit in the back if you are on your own and ensure\nthat you leave all doors unlocked.\nThese are just a few quick tips to bear in mind when you are going\nabout your daily life. If you have concerns regarding personal\nsafety then please do not hesitate to contact the Information\nand Advice Centre, other people that can help include College\nSecurity or the local police.\nThe main thing to remember is to always be aware of your\nsurroundings and don\u02bct take risks that you don\u02bct need to.\nDon\u02bct let your concern turn into a crisis make The Information\nand Advice Centre your one stop shop for all your welfare\nneeds.\nTel: 020 7594 8067\nE-mail: advice @imperial.ac.uk\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Adviser\nadvice@imperial.ac.uk\nDon\u2019t Be Afraid Of The Dark\nHealth & Safety Advice\nimperial\ncollection\nthe\nTHE IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCHARITY FASHION SHOW\nFRIDAY 3RD NOVEMBER 06 | 7:30pm\nGREAT HALL, SHERFIELD BUILDING,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON, SW7 2AZ\nAFTER PARTY FROM 10 PM AT\nTHE ROOF GARDENS CLUB\nVIP \u00a325 | Guest \u00a317.50 | (including After Party) | After Party \u00a315\nFor tickets email>>>\nwye.fashion@imperial.ac.uk\nwww.icpanache.com\npanache| fashion fusion no\u00ebl\nWebsite Success\nUpdate on imperialcollegeunion.org\nThe Union website imperialcollegeunion.org has been going\nfrom strength to strength since the beginning of term.

After tearful goodbyes from his sister\n(number four prostitute in all of Kazakhstan), his strapping wife (who\nkindly threatens to cut off his cock\nif he is unfaithful) and of course, the\ntown rapist, Borat sets off with his\ncomrade and the film\u2019s \u2018producer\u2019,\nAzamat Bagatov.\nMuch hilarity ensues on their panAmerican odyssey with numerous\nabsolutely classic moments such as\nwhen the pair nocturnally escape\nfrom a guest-house run by Jews.\nBorat is taught how to use a toilet\nat a dinner party and later, accosts\nrandom New-Yorkers in the street.\nThey are not amused.\nThe plot develops with hilarious\nconsequences with Borat bizzarely\nobsessing over marrying Pamela\nAnderson (even seeing that video\ndissuades him only momentarily).\nThis results in our protagonist attempting to wed the Baywatch icon\nin traditional Kazakh-style when\nhe attends her book signing. I do\nthough, fully understand her re-fusal. After all, he does try to put a\nmarriage sack, embroidered with\ntheir names, over her head and\nmake off with the actress.\nThe denouement is that our two\nheroes return to Kazakhstan after\nlearning many lessons, not least\nabout how uptight and socially inept some Americans are (at least\nin this production). Borat even parades a new spouse around the village after his old wife not-so-sadly\npasses away \u2013 high five! We all tried\nto applaud at the film\u2019s finale but\ncontinuous laughter had sapped\nour energy and we could only manage a breathless, \u201cNice!\u201d\nAlthough Borat is the acme of\ncomedy (no subtlety or pretensions\nhere folks), it was in fact surpassed\neasily in humour by the post-show-ing press conference, where Borat\nappeared in person. After waiting\naround in the resplendent Dorchester Hotel, with many irate journalists who hailed from all around\nEurope, for what seemed like one\nwhole hour (reporters have no pa-tience), the film\u2019s star entered with\nAzamat, amid much joyful cheek\nkissing and hand waving.\nBorat then proceeded to refer to\nthe dulcet-toned Charlotte Church\nas a \u2018Welsh prostitute\u2019. He refused\nto respond to questions from fe-Sacha Baron Cohen starring in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America\nfor Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan\nFilm times for Fulham\nBroadway from Friday,\nNovember 3 to Thursday,\nNovember 9, 2006\nPaid Previews\nPrestige (12A) (RT 2h30)\nWed/Thurs only: 12.30 15.20\n18.10 21.05\nSubtitled Shows\nA Good Year (12A) (RT 2h20)\nSun @ 15.30 and Tuesday@\n18.15\nAudio Description\nA Good Year (12A) (RT 2h20)\nDaily: (Sat/Sun 15.30) 18.15\n20.50 Fri/Sat Late: 23.35\nBorat (15) (RT 1h45)\nDaily: (Sat/Sun)11.00 13.00\n15.00 17.00 19.00 21.30\nFri/Sat Late: 23.45\nSixty Six (12A) (RT 2h)\nDaily: 12.00 14.20 16.35 19.05\n21.20 Fri/Sat Late: 23.30\nLittle Children (15) (RT 2h40)\nDaily: (Sat/Sun 11.10) 14.10\n17.10 20.10\nSaw 3 (18) (RT 2h10)\nDaily: 13.50 16.20 18.45 21.20\nFri/Sat Late: 23.50\nA Good Year (12A) (RT 2h20)\nDaily: (Sat/Sun 15.30) 18.15\n20.50 Fri/Sat Late: 23.35\nStep Up (PG) (RT 2h5)\nDaily: 14.00 18.55\nBarnyard (PG) (RT 1h50)\nSat/Sun 10.40\nMarie Antoinette (12A)\n(RT2h25)\nDaily: (Fri- Mon 13.45)\nThe Last Kiss(15) (RT2h05)\nDaily: 16.30 21.35\nThe History Boys (15) (RT\n2h10) Daily: (Fri- Mon 16.20)\nOpen Season (PG) (RT 1h50)\nDaily: (Sat/Sun 11.05) 13.20 (\n15.30 Fri/Mon- Thur)\nThe Devil Wears Prada (PG)\n(RT2h10)\nDaily: 12.50 15.40 18.10\n20.40 Fri/Sat Late: 23.15\nThe Departed (18) (RT 2h55)\nDaily: 13.40 17.15 20.30\nGeneral\nshowings\nNew\nreleases\nPatrick Tumilty\nA young white rather than a ripened red\nRidley and Russell reunited! Great!\nHistorical epics never were the\nsame after Gladiator. But what\u2019s\nthis? No swords, no grandiose battles and not a Roman in sight. Instead we get a \u2018light comedy\u2019 that\nis as great a change of direction for\nboth of these Hollywood A-listers\nas any of us could imagine. And do\nthey mess it up? Of course not. But\nit won\u2019t make your top 10 either.\nA Good Year isn\u2019t a film for delivering surprises. The story focuses\non Crowe\u2019s character, Max, a London investment banker who inherits from his uncle a French chateau\nand vineyard in Provence where\nhe used to holiday as a child. As\nhe tries to offload it onto the first\nbuyer, he reconnects with the countryside and when his professional\ncareer back in London goes under\ninvestigation, the fate of his inheritance becomes uncertain. Chuck in\nthe couple of mandatory foils into\nhis plan to sell, namely a feisty wait-ress, Fanny, who captures his heart\nand the arrival of a girl who claims\nto be the illegitimate daughter of\nMax\u2019s uncle, and the thin storyline\nis in place. Twists and turns at every corner? Not unless your sense\nof foresight is seriously dented.\nFor fans of Russell Crowe, this\nfilm might confuse. It doesn\u2019t rely\non his fantastic acting ability (as did\nA Beautiful Mind) or his fervent\nmasculinity (that which propelled\nGladiator and Cinderella Man)\nand so seems more like an excuse\nto hang out with old mate Ridley\nagain. Scott himself has also departed from his usual line of work;\na strong statement considering his\ndiverse filmography to date. This\ndoesn\u2019t have the drama of Blade\nRunner, horror of Alien, grandeur\nof Gladiator or hand-clasping-desert-driving girl power of Thelma\nand Louise. Despite this, both turn\nin fine work with Scott presenting\nProvence as paradise with some\nincredible lighting and Crowe suitably convincing the audience he\u2019s\nnot the same man who throws\nphones at hotel receptionists.\nThe supporting cast also shine\nwith Marion Cotillard as the delicious French sex bomb who catches Crowe\u2019s eye and Abbie Cornish\nas the alleged heir whose American\nidealism provides a strong contrast\nto Crowe\u2019s cynicism. The ensemble work well together, interacting\nas smoothly with each other as they\ndo with such gorgeous scenery.\nThe constant references to wine\nthroughout bring to mind the recent hit Sideways but the mediocre\nstory here will not garner the same\npraise of that film. The comedy\nis lighter, the tale forgettable and\ndespite the underlying message of\n\u201clife is meant to be savoured\u201d, the\nexcitement of the Max\u2019s financial\nkilling at the start is never matched\nby the scenes in France. The idea\nhere was never to make an entry\ninto film history however. Its place\nis more suited to a quiet Sunday af-ternoon, sitting, sans hangover, in\na comfy armchair, savouring each\ndrop like a fine wine. This may not\ngain classic status, but A Good Year\ndoes provide a pleasant two hours.\nAlex Casey\nRussell Crowe immediately phones his agent upon realising he\u2019s stepped onto the set of Jurassic Park 4\n17\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nmale reporters; these had to be\nrelayed through a male \u2018interpreter.\u2019 He did address one young lady\nas she arose to ask her question.\nHowever, it was only to say, \u201cNice!\nHow much? You stay behind after!\u201d\nWhen quizzed by the sole (and un-lucky) Israeli journo attendee, he\nreplied in terrified tones, \u201cKeep\nyour claws where I can see them!\u201d\nAnd later, addressing the same gen-tleman, amid our riotous guffaws,\nstated, \u201cI will crush you!\u201d Although\nthe questions were thoroughly pre-screened, they did assure raucous\nhumour during Borat\u2019s speech.\nI did not take up the generous offer to stay with him in his Kazakh\nhome with free use of his sister and\nmuch \u201cdog-shooting.\u201d I will, how-ever, go to see this movie again and\nagain and so should you.\n\n"

Still no Neighbours omnibus, but\nthe first anniversary special of Deal Or No Deal\nhas sated my desire for trashy\ntelevision (at least I\u2019m told that\nthe programme\u2019s trashy, but Noel\nEdmonds could hardly be much\nmore classy).\nSo, Halloween has come and\ngone (actually, at the time of writ-ing, it has yet to happen, so disregard all of what follows) and\nknees were probably up all round.\nThis year I didn\u2019t buy a pump-kin. since it\u2019s such a colossal\nwaste of money and I\u2019m no fool.\nIn hindsight however, I do regret\nnot bowing under the barrage of\nspooky marketing that has beset\nthe nation, since a hollowed out\npumpkin would have been the\nperfect housing for my poor, neglected strobe light (as well as a\nperfect weapon against epileptic\ntrick-or-treaters).\nTo continue on from the theme\noflastweek,briefly,Iwillwarnyou\nthat a few strobe lights bought off\neBay and a handful of glow-sticks\ndo not a perfect club-night make.\nFor a start, your house is probably not a club and, as such, if you\ndo not invite people they simply\nwill not come. In fact, if you do decide to go down the treacherous\npath into the world of home-club-bing, without a bucketload of hallucinogenic drugs you are likely\nto notice that you\u2019re actually just\na loner sat in your living room\npissing off the neighbours. Really, you\u2019d just be better off swallowing your pride and switching\nNeighbours back on.\nAs for the page this week, you\u2019ll\nsee that we have two reviews and\na teensy little preview to entertain you for as long as it takes for\nyou to read them. Hopefully the\nreviews prove to be as enlightening and fascinating to you as they\nare to me.\nFinally, a recommendation for\nthis weekend. On Sunday 5th get\nyour callipygian behinds over to\nthe union for another Alternative Music Society run Kids Will\nBe Skeletons gig-night, with lots\nof tasty (and French) bands employing myriad styles to tantalise\nand delight your senses. I hope to\nsee all of you there!\nUntil next week, enjoy all your\nnights out and maybe even send\nus a review or two.\nParty\ntime\nagain!\nAlex Baldwin\nNightlife Editor\nAdventures in Farringdon\nFabric\u2019s seventh birthday celebrations fail to deliver promised root vegetables\nBeing the totally dedicated reviewer that I am, I decided to take this\nclub review from a different angle:\na sober one. Yes indeed, I did not\ndrink a single beverage during our\nevening at Fabric, mainly for the\nsomewhat stupid reason that I decided to drive there, although for\nthe sake of this review, I\u2019ll say that\nit was so I could fully appreciate the\nwonder of the many acts I was planning to see, who did indeed turn out\nto be quite wondrous, and perfect\nfor the final night of the Fabric 7th\nbirthday celebrations.\nBy the time we had worked out\nhow the hell to drive to Farringdon\nfrom South Kensington, it was\nabout 11pm, so the place was fairly\nbusy when we arrived. Although not\nso full as to make it uncomfortable,\nthe atmosphere was very friendly\nand, as expected, it was not full of\nobnoxiously drunk wankers (prob-ably due to the fairly high drinks\nprices) and in fact everyone was\nrather smartly dressed, giving the\nplace a feel of what Trash might be\nlike if one thousand people could fit\nin The End on a Monday night.\nIt was also somewhat refreshing to go to a club with this kind\nof music with mainly middle-class,\ntrendy clientele and not have to\nqueue up waiting for 15 arseholes\ncharging up on nose-candy to finish\nwith the cubicles in the toilets. Anyway, enough with the bitching about\npointless stuff \u2013 I went here to listen to music, not to rate everyone\u2019s\noutfits and hairstyles (although I\ndid that too \u2013 7/10). So, on with the\nreview.\nUnfortunately, possibly due to the\nvery confusing layout of Fabric, and\nme not noticing that they had set\nlists up on the wall near the bar until about 1am, I missed most of the\nbands I wanted to see, but the first\nfull act I did see was the Futureheads DJ set which consisted of a\nhilariously varied selection of party\ntracks, albeit with somewhat dubious mixing skills, but managing to\npretty much pack out Room 1 for\nthe duration of their set.\nBored with dancing to the sounds\nof the 80s, we ventured over to\nRoom 3 to catch the middle of the\nSebastian and Kavinsky set, churning out some banging electro beats\nand mixing it up to an ultra-packed\nroom of extremely sweaty, wide-eyed electronic junkies. Basically,\nthey were pretty damn good, possibly nearly as good as their coun-trymen, Justice (who I recently\nsaw DJing at Trash), perhaps because their sets sounded pretty\nmuch identical. Who cares though?\nI don\u2019t want to hear all this new-fan-gled rubbish, I was there to listen\nto some awesome-asaurus tracks\nplayed by a funny looking little\nFrench dude and some other guy\nI most probably would have recognised as Kavinsky if I had known\nwhat he looks like.\nRoom 3 was definitely the place to\nbe tonight if you had the energy to\nEntranced by Gatecrasher\nIt was a good omen to the start of the\nevening when I barely had to walk\nto the bus stop and hop on the 360\nbus straight to Elephant and Castle, home of Ministry of Sound. As\none of London\u2019s more famous clubs,\nI was looking forward to experiencing it for the first time as well as\nexperiencing my first trance night\nGatecrasher Classics. Expecting\na large queue given its size (2000\ncapacity), I was surprised to find\nthe outside empty. I was also somewhat surprised at the unimpressive\noutside, not dissimilar to airport\ncustoms with its metal detectors.\nHowever this is a sharp contrast to\nthe interior of the club. Entry was\n\u00a315 (\u00a312 in advance), good value for\na club of M.O.S\u2019s standard and for a\nfull six hours inside.\nSlightly empty at 11.30pm, I felt\nthe night might not turn out to what\nit could have been, especially as\nthe only clientele there were the\nslightly over dressed half heartedly\n\u2018bopping\u2019 away to the electro/funky\nhouse playing. Unperturbed, we\nmade our way to the V.I.P\n. lounge\nfor a drink to wait for the Trance to\ncome on: the reason we had come.\nThe lounge itself is very attractive,\nspacious with plenty of seating and\nwith a balcony overlooking the main\nroom, The Box (at this point still de-serted). One slight drawback was\nthe price of the drinks, with our first\nround alone costing well over \u00a320! I\nthink it\u2019s the only club I have been\nto where the Red Bull and bottled\nwater are the same price. Luckily\nfor us, our drinks soon kicked in\nalong with the trance and so we\nmade our way over to the ever-fill-ing dance floor.\nGatecrasherClassicshadSignum,\nM.I.K.E. and Rank 1 belting out the\ntrance classics we had all come for;\nthe second room, The Bar had Matt\nHardwick, Tylor Leigh and more\ngiving us some electro as well as\ntrance later on in the night. Back in\nthe main room Signum played the\ngreatly anticipated classic, What\nYou Got For Me, while throughout\nthe night the crowd were lucky\nenough to have Silence-Delirium\nplayed three times! By 1am the\ndance floor was heaving but come\n3am it had emptied just enough to\ngive us all that little bit more room\nto dance in.\nThe clientele was pretty mixed\n\u2013 ranging from regular trance fans\nto those not so familiar with the\nscene and from the casually attired\nto those who really put a lot of effort\ninto their evening attire. All in all\nit didn\u2019t detract from the fact that\neveryone was thoroughly enjoying\nthemselves and getting into the\nmusic.\nThe great thing about Ministry is\nfor a large club one never feels like\nthey could get lost in yet or that it\nis over run with people, yet it still\nmanages to pack a decent sized\ncrowd in.\nAll in all Gatecrasher Classics is\na fantastic night for those seeking\nsomething a little different from\nLondon\u2019s mainstream clubs and\nalso for those used to music of a\nharder nature. A perfect introduction to one of London\u2019s more pleasant venues.\nCaz Knight\ndance, and alas, if only I had more\nenergy and maybe something a little stronger than my glass of water\nwith extra ice to drink, I\u2019d have\nstayed here \u2018til closing. However,\ngiving into my weak body after only\none hour of simultaneously being\ncompressed against 15 sweaty people whilst trying to stay standing up\nI decided to vacate Room 3 to check\nout Metronomy in Room 1.\nI seemed to remember Alex telling me Metronomy were maybe\nquite good and possibly not horrendously rubbish, and indeed, he was\ncorrect. They started off with pretty\nsimple guitar/synth/dance tracks\nbut eventually turned the room into\na gyrating mass of fans with their\nnew-rave, funky electro sounds.\nThey even had cool lights on their\nT-shirts, so what more could you\nwant? If they didn\u2019t please the\ncrowd, Filthy Dukes certainly did.\nPlaying a similar set to Sebastian\nin the other room, but with perhaps\nless of a house vibe to it, almost everyone in the club moved to Room 1\nfor them, and the final act Simian\nMobile Disco who ended the night\non a perfect high.\nBy 3am most of the people were\nstarting to leave and we followed\nsuit, happy that we\u2019d spent a great\nnight out, although not relishing\nthe prospects of trying to drive all\nthe way home (and a warning \u2013 the\npolice hang out in unmarked cars\noutside the club, pulling people\nover who drive).\nAll in all, this place reminded me\nof what Our Disco used to be like\nbefore it vanished, and I would definitely recommend it if there is ever\na similar line-up. Speaking of Our\nDisco, the line-up at Fabric on 3rd\nand 4th November is mind-blow-ingly amazing. Soulwax\u2019s Nite Versions live, 2ManyDJs, Vitalic live,\nUffie live, Our Disco DJs, Headman\nand more will invade the club for\nthe entire weekend. I\u2019ll be there,\nand you should be too.\nUffiesaurus\nGatecrasher Classics\nMinistry of Sound\nHHHII\nMore people were present on the night, I imagine\nSimian Mobile Disco\nPreview:\nRadio Soulwax\nWeekender\nThis weekend, the legendary 2Man-yDJs land on Fabric in both their\nDJ guise and as the live act Soulwax performing their album Nite\nVersions. They will be joined by a\nhost of the most exciting electro\nacts around at the moment, including Vitalic (live), Headman, Uffie\n(live), MUSTAPHA 3000 and many\nothers. Soulwax will be headlining on Friday and Saturday, so you\nhave no excuse for missing it!\n15\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nNIGHTLIFE nightlife.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

In those three\ndays we were told that our only\noption was to sleep on the floor of\nsome cupboard in the corner of the\nhotel with no locks and only a rapist named Vlad for company. I spent\nhours on the phone to some bored\nidiot in Slough who was desperate\nfor a cigarette break and didn\u2019t care\nin the least if I ended up strung up\nwith no pants on. Lastminute.com\nhave made my list and will remain\nthere until the next time I can\u2019t be\nbothered looking anywhere else\nand, victim of advertising that I am,\nbook with them yet again.\nVilnius has been annexed a great\ndeal. Every time some superpower\nfound themselves with little to do,\nthey annexed Vilnius for a Sunday\nlark. As a result, it is a truly European cultural blend, and all the better for it. The Old Town is one of the\nbiggest in Europe and exists as one\nof the finest examples of Baroque\narchitecture one can see. It was\nhowever, built over a few centuries\nso amongst the Baroque rests the\naustere splendour of the Renaissance and the intricate madness\nthat those crazed Gothic architects\ndreamt up. In the 3.6 square kilome-tresoftheOldTown,46Churcheslit-ter the skyline: there are the gaudy\ncrowns atop Orthodox Churches,\nthe great white domes of Catholic\nChurches and the more subtle yet\non inspection, equally magnificent\nsynagogues, all resting in what\nnow appears as harmony, but one\nimagines the friction of old, electrifying the city to its core. For the\ndiscerning Religious viewer the\ntwo most necessary attractions\nare St. Anne\u2019s\nChurch \u2013 with a\nfa\u00e7ade of such\nGothic pomp\nthat a sprightly\nNapoleon, on his\nway to freeze in Russia, wished to\ncarry it to Paris \u2018in the palm of his\nhand.\u2019 Then there is the Church of\nSaint\u2019s Peter and Paul: a Baroque\ninterior which took decades to carve\nout of pure white stone, so intricate\nand delicate, taking the breath from\nyour lungs on entry, it exists as a\nkind of architectural extreme sport,\nvacating your lungs of air on entry,\nnot giving it back until you wander\nback into the sunlight outside. Baroque parachuting, perhaps.\nBut the greatness of Vilnius is not\nits landmarks; the castles, the Cathedral all have something to offer,\nbut the lustre of the place is gained\nfrom a holistic view. Just wan-der. Curved streets with coloured,\ndetailed facades litter the place.\nCourtyards in\nunexpected\nplaces; climbing\nivy and grand\ntrees framing\ncrumbling stone\nbuildings, history emanating from every\nfissure. Stroll\nacross a bridge with hundreds of\npadlocks left by newly married\ncouples covering the railings; enter the esoteric world of the Uzupis\ndistrict, whose people (artists obvi-ously) decided to declare independence from the rest of Vilnius. Read\ntheir constitution, engraved in\nmetal, hung on the wall of an insignificant alley: \u2018A cat has the right to\nbe a cat,\u2019 and other quaint inanities.\nThe atmosphere of the place, unlike any other I have experienced,\nis to be imbibed everywhere you go,\naround every corner, at the foot of\nevery holy structure and in front of\nevery crazed market seller.\nDo, however, avoid the boiled\npig\u2019s ear. Vilnius has managed to\ncultivate a drinking culture that\nis beyond the grasp of dear old\nBlighty. The idea of spending time\nin a pub, drinking slowly whilst\neating an (often) excellent meal is\na welcome change from the unex-plainable compulsion London creates of inhaling 8 pints in 2 hours,\ninhaling 2 kebabs in 8 minutes and\nstomping off to find a corner to fulfil\nthe duel purpose of vomit receptacle and bed for the night. The pubs\nin Vilnius are a glory indeed. Vast\ncaves, dark halls, wooden and at-mospheric, trees growing up from\nthe basement are all far superior to\na Wetherspoons, whose main ascetic feature is the crumpled hooker in\nthe corner. Food is served by Baltic beauties and is everything you\ncould want to accompany a 2-litre\njug of beer: Zeppelins are a deep-fried potato oval, filled with cream,\nmeat, cheese and bacon, topped\nwith cream, meat cheese and bacon.\nFried bread sticks with a creamy,\ncheese concoction make beer taste\nlike Athena\u2019s breast milk (possibly)\nand meat comes bloody and softer\nthan the clouds above. But there\nare pitfalls: platters of ear, fried or\nboiled, stumps which were once the\nfoot of a pink porker, sheep\u2019s stomachs \u2013 which,\nwhen bitten into,\noccasionally\ncrack, revealing putrid green\njuices and black\nstones of undigested food. One\nmust learn to\ntake the rough\nwith the smooth when eating in\nVilnius.\nVilnius is, apparently, the new\nPrague, along with about 5 other\ncapitals in Eastern Europe. Largely\nbecause of its size, Vilnius probably\ndoes have the potential to become\na seething mass of tourism though,\nso go now before the stampede of\nshaven-headed English men ar-rive, holding aloft the stag, \u2018la la\nla-ing\u2019 into the night and perpetuating the stereotype in yet another\ninnocent nation. In one pub, I saw\nthe first wave, standing in a circle,\npints clasped close to their Burberry shirts, looking around, tongues\nout, searching for birds and fights.\nThe English thug is an unfortunate\ncreature. They should be cleansed,\nby nail-gun if necessary. I\u2019ll do it,\nvigilante style, if legislation does not\narrive soon to rid us of this plague.\nSo, what of The Gorgon and Jim\nMorrison? Well, Jim had somehow\nmanaged to get to San Francisco\nfor a month and had come back\nfirmly believing he was in fact, The\nLizard King. Either nobody had\nthe heart to tell him he was not a\nlook-a-like, or they just blindly accepted him as a grim product of\nWesternisation. The Gorgon was\nin fact called Gorga (as if it makes\na difference) and was the most entertaining encounter of my young\nlife so far. A mass of uncontrollable\nnonsense, he prowled the bar, swigging people\u2019s drinks, caterwauling\nall the while, and then returning to\nexplain the subtleties of Lithuanian\nculture to me (in bellowed Lithuanian, of course), before going to\nsleep on the floor. The point is that\nin this haven of beauty and history,\nthere was a kind of hospitality like\nno other, a welcoming, inclusive\natmosphere that begs to be experi-enced. Go there, and if you find your\nown Gorgon, or maybe even the legend himself, embrace him, for you\nwill miss him when he\u2019s gone.\nFlyLal planes\nlook similar to\nsomething from\nArt Attack\nFood is served\nwith a two litre\njug of beer, by\nBaltic beauties\nSt. Anne\u2019s Church and the church of the Bernardine Monastery The many guises of Peter Dominiczak as he wrecks it up in Vilnius\n\n"

    "content": "ford, Cambridge, the LSE, UCL, Warwick, Kings, Manchester, Bristol, and\nEdinburgh members of NUS, but they\nare also leading players within it.\nThe NUS provides support services\nto affiliate unions. I strongly doubt that\nICU would be able to employ a strong\nteam of professional lawyers, research-ers, lobbyists, regional liaison officers,\ncampaigns support staff, and officer development staff with just \u00a352,000. Many\nof the benefits of these services may not\nbe immediately obvious to our students,\nbut they are nonetheless important.\nFor example, presently we rely heavily\non the College for legal support, which\nis helpful when ICU is being threatened with legal action from an external\nsource; but what do we do if the College\nthemselves are using lawyers against\nus (as has happened in the past)?\nThe NUS can mobilise its resources\nto achieve things that individual unions\nsimply cannot manage on their own. I\nam currently working through the process of closing down a small section of\nthe Prince Consort Road for our Centenary Ball \u2013 a time consuming and complex task. Last Sunday the NUS closed\ndown two miles of streets in Central\nLondon (and Trafalgar Square) for a\nnational demonstration against top-up\nfees. No other student led organisation\ncan do that!\nOf course the most obvious benefit\nof being in the NUS is that all Imperial\nstudents would be able to obtain official\nNUS discount cards, which are widely\nrecognised outside the South Kensington area and throughout the rest of the\nUK.\nI fully accept that the NUS has its\nfaults and I believe that there is much\nthat we can do to improve it; but I also\nbelieve that we have absolutely no\nchance of changing the NUS whilst we\nstay out. Even though Edinburgh only\naffiliated last year, they have already\nestablished themselves as the leaders of a growing movement for reform\nwithin the NUS and I expect that if we\naffiliate this autumn then we would fully\nsupport and strengthen their cause.\nSo when I come to vote on November\n14th, I will say \u201cyes\u201d to a national voice,\n\u201cyes\u201d to professional support for our\nofficers, \u201cyes\u201d to reform, and \u201cyes\u201d to\ndiscount cards.\nWielding the\nmighty organ\nF\near not, dear reader, for I have returned from\nmy editorial hiatus, and I\u2019d like to get a few\nthings straight. Firstly, I didn\u2019t put myself on\nthe front page. I was graduating at the time,\nand my deputy editors were in charge. When\nI returned on Thursday, my face had become the front\npage picture story, and they weren\u2019t really happy about\nremoving it. Secondly, my response to Rupert\u2019s letter\nhas generated a lot of complaints, and I\u2019ve tried to reply\nto all those that took the time to write in individually. If\nyou feel something is missing from Felix, or that I\u2019m doing a terrible job and should be replaced with an educated chimp and a typewriter, then you should tell me. I will\nreply personally to any email sent to me that\u2019s obviously\na \u201cDear Editor\u201d letter. I am only capable of generally directing Felix in a particular direction, not generating the\ncontent personally \u2013 that\u2019s down to you, the readers.\nA few of you that approached me while I was distributing the papers seemed upset about the loss of Page3-which-was-never-on-page-3. \u201cWhere are the titties?\u201d\nthey asked. One young lady wondered if she\u2019d ever get\nsee the rugby team sans shirts again. Well, fear not, for\nFelix has a very talented photographer, and a willing list\nof people to get naked (no, not you again, Luke Taylor).\nYour gratitious nudity will return next term.\nThough you\u2019re probably sick to the back teeth of it,\nnext week\u2019s Felix will be a NUS referendum special,\nwith both the Yes and No campaigns doing their best to\nconvince you that their cause is the right one. You can be\nassured that Felix as a whole is neutral, though the team\nhave their own opinions on NUS affiliation.\nI would relate an anecdote in this space, but this week\nthe staff have chained me to a Mac so I can\u2019t escape to\nthe bar. If anyone is reading this, please help.\nReasons for voting \u2018yes\u2019\nI\nmperial has been outside the National Union of Students (NUS)\nfor nearly thirty years and in two\nweeks time we will be faced with\nthat age old question once again:\nshould Imperial College Union affiliate\nto the NUS?\nAll Union Presidents get asked this\nquestion pretty regularly and now that\nI have been officially relieved of my duties as Returning Officer for this referendum I finally have the freedom to\nshare my personal views with you on\nthis subject. Of course, these views are\nmine alone and do not represent the position of ICU or any of its committees or\nconstituent parts. But they are shared\nby many prominent leaders within the\nUnion, including some of my predecessors and colleagues.\nUnlike most London student unions,\nICU has been affiliated to the University of London Union (ULU) but not to the\nNUS since the 1970s. We presently pay\naround \u00a379,000 each year to ULU and\nthey use this money to run bars at Malet\nStreet that our students rarely visit and\nmanage clubs and societies that (with a\nhandful of exceptions) directly compete\nwith our own. The only real benefits we\nget from being part of ULU are that we\nget access to ULU sports leagues, access to other student union officers and\nsupport for our campaigns. Sadly, from\n2007 we will no longer be allowed to be\npart of ULU as our dear Rector is leading Imperial College out of its parent in-stitution, the University of London, and\ninto new territory of independence.\nOur withdrawal from ULU will result\nin two significant consequences: firstly,\nwe will ultimately be \u00a379,000 per annum\nricher. Secondly, we will have no means\nWhy I don\u2019t want ICU to be the most isolated union in London\nof promoting any welfare or political issue that falls outside the jurisdiction of\nImperial College.\nNow we could spend our newly acquired \u00a379,000 p.a. on beer, but I suggest that this is not the most mature\nor inclusive way of allocating ICU\u2019s re-sources. We could spend it on our clubs,\nand we do plan to spend some of it on\ncompensation for those clubs that will\nbe adversely affected by our withdrawal\nfrom ULU. However, with all this spare\nmoney floating about, should we not be\nlooking at the bigger picture?\nWhen we leave ULU next year we will\nundoubtedly become the most isolated\nstudent union in London. We will have\nminimal influence on any debate that\ntakes place outside our campuses, reducing our capacity to represent the\nviews of our members. Should ICU\nwish to campaign on top-up fees, student debt, Council tax, tenancy law, the\nOyster Card, the Congestion Charge,\nthe Charity Bill, or anything else that\nour Rector has no control over, then\nfrankly speaking, we would be powerless to influence these debates.\nImagine if you were a cabinet minister or an editor of a national newspaper\nand you were approached by two student leaders who both wanted to raise\nan issue with you that their constituents felt strongly about. Now imagine if\none of them spoke for 12,000 students\nand the other for 5 million. Who would\nyou listen to?\nWhether you like it or not, there is\nonly one body in the United Kingdom\nthat speaks for UK students on a national level and that is the NUS. Do not\ncome under any illusion that the media\nremotely cares about what we, as Imperial students, think about national issues \u2013 we simply have no voice.\nWe may be the third best university in\nthe country, but the rest of the top 10\nuniversities\u2019 student unions are all affiliates of the NUS; we\u2019re really not that\nimportant. Not only are the likes of OxLast Sunday marked the end of British\nSummer Time for another year, bringing with it the twice-annual irritation of\nadjusting all the clocks to hand, a task\nmade even more arduous by the inclusion of clocks in pretty much every electronic device littered around the average home.\nWhat is doubly galling about this is\nthat most of these are damn-near impossible to adjust, meaning that for the\nnext six months many people will be\nconstantly lied to by their microwaves or\nsetting the wrong things to record with\ntheir set-top boxes, and so on. This year\nsees the ninetieth anniversary of the introduction of this less-than-marvellous\ninnovation which has been with us (on\nand off, of course) since 1916, following\nthe Defence of the Real Act of 1914, one\nof a number of wartime measures such\nas banning kite-flying, feeding bread\nto wild animals, or buying alcohol on\npublic transport, and various powers of\ncensorship and requisition on the part\nof the government.\nBST is not for me, says Hugh Stickley-Mansfield\nFortunately for the kite-flyers of Britain, most of DORA\u2019s provisions have\nsince been removed, but BST still re-mains. The reasons for BST are sensible enough \u2013 to shift the hours of sunlight to when they would be of most use\nin order to increase productivity and reduce accidents. However, this does not\naddress the issue of why winter should\nhave to revert to GMT \u2013 given the lack\nof sunlight at the best of times, why\nfiddle around with the clocks at all? In\nfact, from 1968 to 1971 this was indeed\nthe case, but this was unpopular with\nthe Scottish, amongst others, since\ndawn would approach noon.\nThere is a libertarian argument\nagainst any legislation in the matter,\nsince it should be up to individual organisations and people as to how they\norganise their days, rather than have\ngovernment dictate sudden shifts that\nmay be merely irritating, but also potentially unhealthy. As an insomniac, I\ndread the approach of BST each spring,\nas it often denies me an hour of my already scarce sleep. This is in addition to\nowning considerably more clocks than\nis strictly neccessary (in common with\nGeorge III, who was considerably more\nobsessive about timekeeping, and was\nfortunate enough not to have to contend\nwith any such troubling notions as daylight savings), making the whole concept of BST utterly unappealing to me.\nPerhaps it would be different if I lived in\nsomewhere like Brixton or World\u2019s End,\nin which case I might well care more\nabout whether or not I would be walking home in the dark than I would about\nwasting half an hour every six months\nand having my sleeping habits out of\nkilter for the first fortnight in April.\nThough worse still is forgetting about\nthe whole thing, leading to running an\nhour late for much of the day or to being an hour early and losing any benefit\nthat might come from a potential hour\nextra spent in bed. Or compounding the\nerror by turning clocks forward when\nthey should go back, or vice versa. Not\nthat I did that this year, I assure you.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

Now, there\u2019s a scoop! Tape\nrecorder in hand, I phoned Brian\nfor a chat.\nLong before Queen, Brian had developed a great passion for astron-omy. He chats to me about zodiacal\nlight; \u201cA beautiful light you can see\njust after sunset if you\u2019re lucky and\nyou live in the tropics.\u201d This, then,\nwas the subject of his PhD. \u201cMost\npeople think it\u2019s due to dust in the\nsolar system that\u2019s scattering the\nlight. People were wondering where\nthe dust came from and there was\nthe inkling of the idea that it might\nbe something to do with\nthe way that the solar\nsystem was formed.\nIt was an object of\ngreat interest\nat the time.\u201d\nThe time in\nquestion,\nthe late\n1960s;\nBrian,\na recent\nThis is a beautiful coffee-table\nsize book, filled with gorgeous\nphotographs of the universe\nand elegant explanations of\nthe state of our knowledge\nabout the cosmos, its origins\nand its future.\nDivided into seven chapters,\nit tells the biography of the\nuniverse, sidling through the\nbeginning of light, the universe\u2019s evolution, the formation of stars and planets and\nthe emergence of life. The\nfinal chapters look into the\nfuture and to the anticipated\nend of the universe.\nThe text is accessible and\nengaging without coming\nacross as dumbed down. It is\naimed at a non-scientific audience and includes as asides\n(in \u2018grey areas\u2019) explanations\nof the Kelvin temperature\nscale and other concepts that\nmight be unfamiliar to a non-Imperial student.\nLike bonus tracks on a CD,\nafter chapter 7 we come to\nmore fascinating information.\nTips for getting into practical astronomy and guides\nto the night sky help you go\nfurther; biographies of sixteen\nastronomers and physicists,\nwhose research has led to our\ncurrent understanding of the\nuniverse.\nWhat is unlear is who wrote\nwhat parts of the book.

Back to the 1960s\nImperial music scene, Brian is soon\non more familiar ground. \u201cWell,\nJimi Hendrix\u2026 that was a great\ncoup. He was playing in the Great\nHall. We sold 1000 tickets!\u201d\nBrian\u2019s own music career took off\nat around this time. One of his early\ngroups, 1984, supported Jimi\u2019s Imperial gig, \u201cIf you could call it supporting!\u201d says Brian, bashfully. Later, an early ancestor of Queen was\nto have its first rehearsal in a room\nsomewhere behind the Great Hall.\n\u201cIn those days it was called the Jazz\nClub Room. I rented it for a couple\nof days and that\u2019s where Roger and\nI first played.\u201d This being Queen\ndrummer Roger Taylor, then a student at London Hospital Medical\nCollege. \u201cSo, Roger turned up and\nset up his drum kit and started tuning them and I was quite amazed.\nI\u2019d never seen anyone tuning drums\nbefore,\u201d recalls Brian, used to the\nhit-it-and-hope approach of most\nrock drummers. \u201cHe tuned them\nin the most amazing way so\nthey all started to blend\ntogether. I was absolutely\nstunned.\u201d\nBrian and Roger, with\ntheir friend Tim Staffell,\nplayed under the name\nSmile. But within a\nshort space of time\nthe band line-up\nhad changed to\ninclude Freddie\nMercury on piano\nand vocals, and\nJohn Deacon on\nbass. Queen was\nborn and Brian\nbegan to drift\naway from his astronomy research.\nI wonder if he\never considered\nquitting the band\nfor academia? \u201cI\nthink I was slightly\ndiscouraged with\nacademic life because my supervisor was raising\nso many issues\nabout the thesis,\nsaying \u2018write a\nbit more, write\na bit more\u2019. I\ngot to the point\nwhere I thought:\ngraduate from the Physics depart-ment, was deeply involved in postgraduate academic life at Imperial.\nWhat was life like for an Imperial student in those halcyon days?\n\u201cWell, a lot of hard work,\u201d Brian\nadmits. Some things never change.\nBut this was the world of Swinging\nLondon, and Imperial saw its fair\nshare of action. \u201cIt was a fantastic\ntime to be around musically,\u201d he\nrecalls, \u201cI was on the entertainments committee and we booked a\nlot of great groups: Spooky Tooth,\nfor instance.\u201d I maintain a polite si-lence. But a Wikipedia search later\nreveals this group to be noteworthy\nfor its Cumbrian origins, greatly increasing the rock credentials of\nColin Barras chats to the Queen legend about his new book, Jimi Hendrix jamming\nin the Great Hall and his return to Imperial to finish the most overdue thesis ever\nI can\u2019t do this any more!\u201d This is\nprobably a familiar story for many\ngoing through the PhD process.\nBrian decided to give up the research entirely, and soon Queen\nhad released their first album. The\nrest, as Brian jokingly agrees with\nme, is rock and roll history.\nBut, while you can take the student out of academia, you can\u2019t take\nacademia out of the student. Brian\ncontinued to be fascinated with\nthings astronomical and ultimately\ndeveloped a close friendship with\nPatrick Moore, astronomer and\npopulariser of science. Patrick is\none of Brian\u2019s co-authors on Bang!\nThe Complete History of the Universe, published earlier this month.\nThe book claims to be a readable account of astronomy. Is this a direct\nreference to the work of Stephen\nHawking, famously an author\nwhose books are bought but seldom\nread? \u201cWe have boundless respect\nfor Stephen Hawking,\u201d Brian says,\n\u201cbut I personally found A Brief History of Time a difficult book. A lot\nof people who are deep into their\ndisciplines don\u2019t realise how simple\nthings have to be before a normal\nperson can understand them.\u201d\nThe science communicator\u2019s job\nis a tough one, as Brian concedes,\n\u201cThere\u2019s this fine line you walk. You\ndon\u2019t want to sacrifice major concepts but you don\u2019t want to get deep\ninto problems that people can\u2019t follow.\u201d He has in mind one area of understanding that remains baffling\nto the non-scientist. \u201cI think very\noften it\u2019s the maths that puts people off. I personally love maths, but\na lot of people get an instant block\nwhen they see an integral sign.\u201d\nBut Brian\u2019s interest in science\ncommunication goes beyond this.\n\u201cIn many disciplines you\u2019re wrestling with a problem in one small\narea and the problem could already\nhave been solved in another area\nand you wouldn\u2019t know about it.\u201d To\nhelp the spread of scientific knowledge even within the science com-munity, the authors of Bang! have\nset up a website, www.banguni-verse.com. \u201cI encourage everyone\nto visit. We\u2019re hoping it will develop\nover the next few months as an organ of interaction.\u201d\nThis newly re-kindled passion for\nastronomy has encouraged Brian\nto finish that PhD he began almost\n40 years ago. Surely this is one of\nthe longest running PhDs ever? \u201cI\nknow! It\u2019s going to be a record!\u201d he\njokes. \u201cI\u2019ve been in touch with Professor Rowan Robinson, who\u2019s\nthe head of astrophysics,\nand he\u2019s very kindly offered me a desk and\ncomputer.\u201d Brian has\nalready been down to\n\u201cre-recce\u201d Imperial.\nI ask him if much has\nchanged. \u201cThe big surprise was trees in Beit\nQuad! There was nothing\nthere when I was a stu-dent. You guys have done a\ngood job making it into an\narea that can be used and\nenjoyed. And with tables\nwhere you can sit and have\na beer!\u201d\nHe may be older and wis-er, but Brian is beginning to\nthink like a student again.\nIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\nFelix has 10 copies of Bang! to\ngive away. To win, answer the\nfollowing question:\nWhat musical Instrument did\nBrian May play in the band\nQueen?\na) The kazoo\nb) The guitar\nc) The cello\nEmail to the answer to:\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBang!

    "content": "Not many people would deliberately buy an all-in-one games compilation for the Nintendo DS, so that\u2019s\nwhy we\u2019ve done it for you.\nNintendo\u2019s 42 All-Time Classics is\na collection of famous and not-so-famous games from Chess to Old\nMaid, Chinese Checkers to Koi Koi,\nand Darts to Soda Shake, where\nplayers take it in turns to shake a\nvirtual soda bottle and the one shaking it when the top flies off, loses.\nIt\u2019s important to point out at this\nstage that 42 All-time Classics is a\nstrictly multiplayer affair. The sin-gle-player portion is so lifeless and\nstaid that to endeavour your way\nthrough will simply force you to\nplay games you wouldn\u2019t normally\nhave tried and maybe find some\nhidden gems, as well as unlocking new games for your choices\nin multiplayer. The main single\nplayer game, Stamp, runs through\neach game one-by-one giving three\nstamps for a top performance and\none for a poor performance. Each\ngame requires three stamps to\ncontinue and, handily, if you happen to get more than three on a\nparticular game, then they do carry\nover. It shows that even if you come\nlast that you get a stamp that NinRetro review - 42 All-Time Classics\nYou call that retro? Jesse Garman provides some recommended background gaming\nChoo! Choo! Choo! Full steam ahead!\nIs Valve\u2019s Steam platform the future of digital distribution? Should we be concerned?\nOut now\n\u201cRun, you pigeons! It\u2019s Robert Frost!\u201d\nnot to be.\nThe other single-player game,\ncalled \u201cMission\u201d, is a far more flexible idea, which has an element of\nCrazy Taxi\u2019s mini-games about it.\nEach game is given a goal, which\ncan be forgivingly easy or hor-rifically hard, for example, Hearts\nrequires you to Shoot The Moon,\nwhereas Dots & Boxes requires\nyou to capture all boxes, a fiendish\ntask in comparison. This mode is\nmuch more welcoming but still has\nthe main flaw that it is intolerably\ndull. You\u2019d be better off honing your\npoker skills in real life. Your reward\nfor completing these tasks is a new\nicon, which you can use to represent yourself over a network. This\nbrings me on to the multiplayer\u2026\nThe multiplayer is where the\ngame shines and for this I give it\n8/10. The interface is easily navigable and there is something for\nevery mood from hyperactivity\n(such as Spit) to relaxed sedation\n(Checkers). Up to eight friends can\nplay on one cartridge with little lag\nand means that although many variations are more fun when played\nwith the actual board or playing\ncards, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find\nthem all together in such an accessible package, assuming you have\nat least one other friend with a DS.\nThe other feature is internet-con-nectivity. If you have a compatible\nwireless router in your house (any\nAOSS works), you can connect and\nfind other games that are being\nplayed on the Internet with absolutely no extra components or soft-ware. Unfortunately, I was unable\nto test this as ours was not compatible but I would primarily use this\ngame to play friends I could see and\nhear, the Internet play would most\nlikely be of side interest.\nThe Hearts card game - playable\ntendo don\u2019t want you to linger on a\ngame you don\u2019t like for too long, but\nthat\u2019s part of the problem. I despise\n\u201cCheat\u201d and to be forced to play it\nwith the computer for 3 games in\na row is my idea of hell. The option\nto skip a particular game would\u2019ve\nbeen nice, perhaps one skip per level could\u2019ve been allowed but it was\nAn old maid - not playable\nSteam is an online games distribution network developed by Valve,\nmakers of the Half-Life series. Before Steam was created, Valve relied on WON (World Opponent Network) to run its multiplayer games\nand distribute patches. In 2001\nValve acquired WON and began\nbuilding Steam. The first version of\nSteam was available for download\nin 2002 during the beta test of Counter- Strike 1.4. With the release of\nCounter-Strike 1.5 users of Steam\nand WON could play together on\nthe same servers. Once enough\ntesting was done, Valve shut down\nthe last WON servers in 2004 and\nSteam took over.\nWhen Valve announced that they\nwould distribute their sequel, HalfLife 2, through Steam, many were\ndoubtful that it could work because\nof the amount of bandwidth needed\nto send an entire game over the Internet. However Valve had created\na strong network which used peer-to-peer technology and the online\nrelease of Half-Life 2 was mostly\nsuccessful. This was the beginning\nof online games distribution.\nIndependent developers Introversion were able to reach millions of\ngamers around the world by selling\ntheir games Darwinia and more recently Defcon through Steam. This\nhas allowed the bedroom coders to\nsave money on distribution and to\nsell their games at a lower price by\ncutting out the middle man. Online\ndistribution provides a more level\nplaying field for developers and allows even small studios to become\nsuccessful.\nBig game publishers are also using Steam. Recently, 2K Games and\nActivision have signed contracts\nwith Valve to distribute their games\nthrough Steam. This makes the\nCivilization and Call of Duty series\navailable on Steam. Other publishers are likely to follow and Steam\u2019s\ncontrol of the games distribution\nmarket will increase.\nSteam has begun influencing\ngame design as well. Valve have\nbegun releasing small episodes of\ngames such as their own Half-Life\n2 Episodes and the SiN Episodes by\nRitual. The episode system allows\nyou to buy a part of the game for\nless money than the whole game\nand then if you enjoy it, you can buy\nthe next part. This will probably\nhappen more often in the future as\ngames companies find it increasingly harder to come up with new\nideas for games.\nAs Steam continues to grow security becomes an issue. When HalfLife 2 was released on Steam there\nwere several hacks which could circumvent Steam and allow users to\ndownload the games for free. Since\nthen Valve has rewritten Steam\u2019s\nauthentication system and claims\nthat users cannot play a game on\nSteam if they did not legitimately\nbuy it. However the authentication\nservers go down sometimes. Another problem faced by Steam is users who steal account information.\nValve needs to make Steam more\nsecure if it wants to attract more\npublishers to use it.\nCurrently Steam only accepts\ncredit cards to purchase games\nand this limits who can buy games.\nHowever they are working on allowing PayPal and wire transfer\nas alternate methods of payment.\nThis introduces the problem of age\nverification.\nSony, Microsoft, and Nintendo\nare creating similar distribution\nsystems for their PS3, Xbox 360\nand Wii consoles respectively. Sony\nhas launched the Electronic Distribution Initiative to offer games\non the PS3. Microsoft is expanding its Xbox Live services to offer\nmore content. Nintendo is creating\nthe Wii Compact Software line of\ngames which can be downloaded\nthrough the Wii. Valve is working\non the third version of its Steam client which will manage connections\nbetter and feature an improved\nFriends chat client.\nClearly online distribution is the\nfuture of the games industry and\ntraditional retailers will have to\nadapt.\nHalf-Life 2\u2019s G-Man. A metaphor for corporate heartlessness, or\nmerely a warning to wearers of bad ties? \u201cWake up, Mr Freeman.\u201d\nNeverwinter Nights finally returns\nto game shelves this week with it\u2019s\nsequel, looking to bring the technologies firmly up to date, providing\nthe average player with an engaging single-player experience as well\nas opening up the toolset for more\nnatural, customisable module crea-tion. NWN2 is almost certain to be\none of Christmas\u2019 biggest releases\nfor the PC.\nAnd speaking of dependable fran-chises, this week also sees the return of Sam Fisher to PC and in limited edition form on the Xbox 360.\nSplinter Cell: Double Agent is the\nfourth in the stealthy franchise, and\nthe series certainly seems to have\nstopped dragging its heels after\na pretty samey third incarnation.\nDouble Agent is darker, slicker and\nseems more streamlined than it\u2019s\nprevious outings. An interesting\nchange of pace for Tom Clancy\u2019s\nfinest.\nOr maybe you\u2019re feeling a bit\ndifferent this week? Desperate\nHousewives gets a much-needed\ngaming conversion. Felix Games\nonly has this advice to offer you\n\u2013 it\u2019s been released near a holiday\ninvolving fires for a reason.\nThings have been quiet on the\nGrand Theft Auto front for most\ngamers, but PSP owners can pick\nup a second dose of vehicular thievery this week with the release of\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories. If you weren\u2019t enthused by the\nprevious PSP title, Liberty City Stories, then don\u2019t expect to be blown\naway here, but the series has been\nupdated with features like empire\nbuilding.

    "content": "Science through the looking glass\nFelix examines the new field of neuroesthetics, and decides that it is time to start uniting science and art\nFor me, the choice between art and\nscience first came at the end of\nGCSEs. I was hit with the stark realisation that I might need chemistry and maths A-level to go with the\nbiology that I loved. But if I\u2019d kept\nmy options open at A-level, tthen\nI certainly would have had to pick\nsides when I decided on a degree.\nBut why is there this polarity, never\n\u2018science and art\u2019 but only \u2018either\nor\u2019?\nThe idea of the \u201ctwo cultures\u201d of\nscience and art is an old one. Science is thought of as being all about\nreality, while art allows you to put\nyour own interpretation on life, the\nuniverse and everything. But are\nthey really so different? A scientific\ntheory can be thought of as a representation of reality \u2013 it\u2019s never completely accurate, but it\u2019s supposed\nto help you understand the world\na little better. But isn\u2019t a painting\njust another representation of real-ity? Doesn\u2019t religion help believers\nto understand their world? Does\nscience really have a monopoly on\ntruth?\nEven the smallest introduction to\nphilosophy of science will quickly\nillustrate that scientists don\u2019t have\nall the answers. More and more scientists are turning to art either as\na way to communicate their work,\nor as an interesting new subject\nfor study. A recent event at the Science Museum\u2019s Dana Centre is just\nsuch an example. \u201cArt of the Brain\u201d\nwas presented by Dr Lizzie Burns,\na science-based artist, whose aim\nwas to inspire the audience about\nneuroscience by using art.\nDr Burns presented her own art\ninspired by neurons and the brain,\nand the audience got messy with\npaints, pens and even coloured air\ndough, making their own brain art\nNell Barrie and learning about the brain at the\nsame time. I asked Dr Burns why\nshe thinks art and science can work\ntogether.\n\u201cI genuinely have always loved\nboth art and science,\u201d she told me.\n\u201cI really got into art properly after\n\u2018discovering\u2019 Dali\u2026 he saw science\nas holding the secrets for some kind\nof divine truth. I use art as a tool for\ncommunicating science \u2013 I seem\nfairly unique in having the science\nbackground but also being an artist\u2026 but I see the combination as\na way of being able to help people\nfind their own way into seeing how\nbeautiful and inspiring science is.\u201d\nShe certainly succeeds in inspiring participants in her events. And\nshe\u2019s not alone in combining \u201cthe\ntwo cultures\u201d. Scientists around\nthe world are becoming interested\nin the new field of \u201cneuroesthetics\u201d.\nThe idea behind this new discipline\nis that art, as a human activity, can\nbe understood by looking at the\nlaws of the brain. For example, new\nbrain imaging techniques are beginning to allow neuroscientists to\nstudy the neural basis of visual art.\nThe Institute for Neuroesthetics\nwas recently founded in Berkeley,\nCalifornia, and is attached to the\nWellcome Laboratory of Neurobiology at University College London.\nThe institute pursues the idea of\nconsilience \u2013 the integration of\nknowledge from different fields\n(such as art and science).\nNeuroesthetics is interesting in\nthe way it assumes that art and science are not really so different. Scientists with an interest in where art\nand science meet are now engaged\nin research projects like identifying\nthe molecular basis of the brain\u2019s\nemotional response to art, and looking at neurological conditions like\nsynaesthesia, in which the senses\nbecome intertwined so that sounds\nDa Vinci decoded: a beautiful mind\nMention the words \u2018da Vinci\u2019 and\nmost people will automatically think\nof Dan Brown\u2019s over-rated pot-boiler, or perhaps of the legendary\nMona Lisa. If, like me, you have dutifully trouped off to the Louvre in\norder to see that \u2018enigmatic\u2019 smile\nfrom 100 feet away, behind hordes\nof like-minded tourists, you might\nhave felt the selfsame disappointment as me.\nHowever, the da Vinci Exhibition\ncurrently on show at the V&A provides no such disappointment. The\ncollection manifests itself as a fascinating and beautifully arranged\ncollection of sketches and thoughts\nof the prolific genius that was Leonardo. It provides the viewer with\nsome insight into the thoughts of\narguably the greatest artistic and\nscientific mind the world has ever\nseen.\nThe underlying and continuous\ntheme running through the exhibition is of the great man\u2019s fascination with how the world works\n\u2013 of how everything (including the\nhuman body) is mirrored in the\nwhole of nature: the smaller merely\nreflecting the whole. Thus, we are\nprivileged to witness Leonardo\u2019s interest in the workings of the human\nbody via sketches and scribblings.\nIn one display, he draws the arteries of an old man (Leonardo himself\nskilfully dissected the old man after\ndeath). At once, the observations\nof the human arterial system seem\nto have triggered a parallel fascination and flurry of intellectual output\nassociated with rivers and aqueducts (not least architectural ideas\ninvolving aquaducts, valves, pumps\nand irrigation systems). The \u2018body\nof the world\u2019, \u2018veins of water\u2019 and\nthe \u2018tree of blood vessels\u2019 as he himself described them, were the inspiration for these new ideas. That is,\nthe workings of the human system\n(ie. nature), such as the heart valve\nand the manner in which the body\npumps blood, provided the inspiration for these new architectural\nideas.\nThere is little doubt however, that\ndespite being appreciated mainly\nfor his artistic side (at least in our\nday and age), this exhibition celebrates Leonardo the Scientist \u2013 one\nwho utilised drawing as a primary\ntool of analysis. For example, the\niconic image of a man drawn within a circle and a square with outstretched arms and legs was, for\nLeonardo, the product of a study in\nhuman proportion. Other sketches\nof parts of the human anatomy and\nbuildings are also studies of propor-tion, or innovatory ways of shaping\nspace (such as the depiction of an\nextraordinarily \u2018plastic\u2019 spiral staircase \u2013 the technical feat of a very\nskilled draughtsman). Of course,\nthese drawings are no less beautiful for the fact they are first and\nforemost scientific studies. Here\nwe see that science and art are\ninterchangeable; though whether\nLeonardo himself made the distinction is debatable.\nCertainly his oil painting of the\nMona Lisa residing in the Louvre,\nis one in which beauty rather than\nscience seems to be a primary aim;\nhowever, even in this work, the\nbackground mountains are studies\nof proportion and space, the face of\nthe Mona Lisa draws from his fascination and subsequent mathematical studies of light reflecting off the\nhuman face (drawings which we\nsee in this exhibition).\nFurthermore, the figure of the\nMona Lisa herself is also more\nthan partially the result of da Vinci\u2019s fascination with human pro-can be coloured and colours can\nhave their own sounds.\nIt\u2019s a young field, but with big\nplayers like the Wellcome Trust\nbecoming more engaged with art\nthrough their Sciart programme\n(funding art based around the biomedical sciences) it looks like art\nand science are set to become better friends than ever before.\nSo while the new spin on \u201cthe two\ncultures\u201d aims to bring science and\nart together, it\u2019s becoming clear\nthat the two have never really been\nseparate. Prehistoric art was a window on the artists\u2019 world, just as sci-portion. Perhaps most startlingly\nof all, da Vinci manages to render\nthat most irrational thing \u2013 beauty\n\u2013 into something highly rational\nand scientific.\nThus, the \u2018Experience, Experiment and Design\u2019 exhibition at the\nV&A showcases Leonardo\u2019s application of the rational, his struggle\nfor new knowledge and his attempts\nto uncover laws of the universe. It\nis during this process that he also\nsimultaneously uncovered great\nbeauty. Here we witness the workings of a breathtakingly original\nmind, yet we also see how the application of science to his art helped\nhim to come up with a massive array of new ideas. Indeed his ability\nto combine all these aspects have\nprovided the inspiration for some of\nthe greatest inventions and works\nof art known to mankind.\nLeonardo da Vinci: Experience,\nExperiment, Design.

It is the source of all true art\nand science.\u201d And no, it wasn\u2019t Dali\nwho said that. It was Einstein.\nDa Vinci\u2019s intricate observations\nOne of the products of \u201cArt of the Brain\u201d. sponspored by the Medical Research Council and EDAB\nTamara Nicolson\n5\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "The IC girls arrived at Harlington\nin a confident mood, following a 12-0 victory in their previous game.\nAttempting intimidation tactics\nthrough dynamic stretching prowess is a popular theme of the 2nd\u2019s\nmatches, UCL were treated to a\nspecial display incorporating goal-ie-worship routines.\nThe game began with a solid, if\nrather conservative, defence for IC,\nlead by Izzy playing a great game\nas sweeper and Fi showing us what\nshe can do if we let her up in the\nmidfield for a match!\nAs the game progressed, IC became more attacking, with numerous opportunities in the \u2018D\u2019 finally\nresulting in a somewhat scrappy\ngoal from Dasha. The next goal\nshowed rather more flair, with Dasha planting an awesome cross for\nMelissa to finish before UCL knew\nwhat hit them.\nUCL rarely had a chance to\nthreaten the IC goal; when they did,\ngood clearing from short corners\nand some excellent hitting from\nBella quickly saw IC back in attack.\nTrish and Melissa worked hard on\nthe left side; covering more ground\nthan I did in the whole of last sea-son! Unfortunately most of IC\u2019s\nA beautiful performance\nbreaks failed to reach the stick of a\nstriker; with a little more organisation the score line may have reflected the dominance of IC\u2019s play.\nGirl of the game was a difficult\ndecision and came down to a boat\nrace between Bella, Fi and Izzy;\nBella won in style to claim the title,\nfor services to hitting the ball very\nhard yet with surprising accuracy.\nTwat of the match was an easier de-cision, and was claimed by Izzy for\na very elegant fall on her backside!\nSpecial mentions go to Mary for\nstanding in as goalie despite being\nunable to move most of her limbs,\nto Roxy for letting us have her, and\nDasha for hitting with her stick, not\nher head.\nPost-match celebrations saw our\ncaptain in a rather delicate state; I\nam assured this was wholly the responsibility of Bella and most definately not Fi herself.\nAlice Rowlands\nSport Editor\nIC Ladies demonstrate elegance in an unorthodox warm-up routine\nThe 1st XV were in high spirits\nafter an impressive performance\nagainst Royal Holloway, last year\u2019s\nULU Cup winners who beat the 1st\nXV in the final. Today\u2019s opponents\nwere another side promoted due\nto BUSA restructuring, and were\nkeen to stamp their authority.\nThe game started poorly for IC;\nthe Royal Free forwards were\nfired up and were a lot more physical up front, and after some sustained pressure they managed to\ndrive the scrum from five metres\nout over the IC try line to get the\nfirst points of the day.\nThis pressure continued in the\nscrums and in tight play, but some\npoor tackling by the forwards let\nthe centre over the try line for\nRoyal Free\u2019s second try.\nOnly then did IC wake up and\nstarting playing their own game;\nwith mouvement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral occurring in full flow all over the park,\nRoyal Free were unable to control\nthe apparent chaos that was unfolding in front of them.\nHowever, poor finishing meant\nthat IC never crossed the line and\nRoyal Free took the advantage\nagain by scoring the third try of the\nhalf with a run through the centres.\nIC Rugby lads embarrassed\nby Royal Free Medics\u2019 team\n35\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nSPORT sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nIf only the match were up to the standard of the warm up!\nLosing 17 \u2013 0 at half time, IC were\ngetting fired up for the second half\nwhich saw big tackles occurring all\nover the field. Nathan made sure\nRoyal Free would not try and run\nthrough the centres again by flattening their centre and knocking\nhim out.\nUp front, man of the match Ben\nMoorhouse was a machine, tackling everything in sight and making sure their forwards couldn\u2019t\nget through the side of the ruck\nand mauls.\nAgain, IC\u2019s movement and play\nwas sensational, particularly from\nthe backs, but poor finishing and\nthe forwards were in set play without a proper hooker stopped them\nfrom scoring.\nThe last five minutes saw extremely fast play; Royal Free\nscored their fourth try, and IC finally decided to wake up and play\nrugby! Up front, the forwards ran\nat the opposition with persistent\npressure, paying off with Bo driving over the line for IC\u2019s first try,\nwhich was quickly followed by\nquick hands from the kick off to\nfind Mike, on the wing, who simply glided through the oppositions\nbacks to score.\nAlthough a disappointing result,\nthe team can take some brilliant\nmoments of play and take it into\nnext weeks game against GKT.\nJovan Nedic\nIC faced St George\u2019s in their first\nhome game of a slow starting sea-son. The game was almost won\nbefore kick off; the reputation of\n\u201cFortress Harlington\u201d striking fear\ninto medics nationwide. IC adopted\nthe 4-1-3-2 system, used by England to secure the 1966 World cup\nfinal (a match, coincidently, also\nplayed against a load of pricks).\nSt George\u2019s were so sure of defeat\nthey turned up forfeiting the game\nto avoid humiliation. Captain Skeen\nwas having none of it, and the Medic\nannihilation began.\nFrom the outset IC played with\ntremendous flair and skill. Nutmegs, Cruff turns and Ronaldostyle step-overs were being served\nup in abundance. IC were so confident that Alex \u201cNuts!\u201d Rybka allowed St George\u2019s to nutmeg him;\nthe sign of a truly confident football-er. Even the keeper Frank \u201chawk\neye\u201d O\u2019Neil (known for his ability to\nspot a penalty from the other end of\nthe pitch) wanted aboard the now\nfully loaded showboat. Having received the ball from a pass back, he\nplayed it off an advancing attacker\nand picked it up again, a move now\nknown as \u201cThe O\u2019Neil\u201d.\nIC dominated the midfield with\nJeremy \u201cThe Erotic\u201d Lovett and\nSam Rickett, feeding countless\nthrough-balls to Max \u201cI swear it\u2019s\nmy real name\u201d Steel and Luca\nLaraia to chase, testing the soon-to-be-exhausted St George keeper.\nWide mids Alex \u201cI will only score\nstylish goals\u201d Avila and Alex Rybka\ngave IC depth of attack, which St\nGeorge could barely understand-let alone deal with. With so much\npressure, something was bound\nto give and right before half time\nthat turned out to be Max\u2019s ankle-an horrific tackle from a rubbish\nmedic hacked it of. Frank politely\nexplained what happened to the\nreferee, in a language which may\nonly be described as \u201cIrish\u201d, and\nwas duly awarded a penalty. James\n\u201cThe Shadow\u201d Skeen placed the\nball in the boggy, cut up, marsh of a\npenalty area as the air grew tense.\nThe unthinkable happened as the\n7-foot keeper, with hands the size of\nthe goal, saved the perfectly struck\nshot, leaving the score at 0-0 at half\ntime. In the second half, near gale\nforce winds allowed St George\u2019s a\nfew shots, against the run of play.\nThe combination of Mike \u201cThe\nButcher\u201d Allen and Scott \u201cRazor\u201d\nMcKenzie at centre back ensured\nchances were kept to a minimum.\nThe introduction of Tariq \u201cThe\nStealth\u201d Melham at half time and\nthe attacking nature of Paul \u201cnot\nthe shark\u201d Szczesiak gave IC increased width in midfield; splitting\nthe St George\u2019s defence wider than\na \u201cMaster-full\u201d mother of ill repute.\nWith the time running out, Luca\n\u201cThe Assistant\u201d Laraia put Sam\n\u201cThe Scorer\u201d Rickets through on\ngoal, he finished with Thierry Henry style. The game was one of the\nmost convincing 1-0 victories ever,\nand the start of the IC 4ths 100%\nhome record.\nIt has been eight long, exercise-free months since the end of last\nyear\u2019s football season. On Saturday\nhowever, with trials completed and\na new batch of freshers initiated\ninto (unofficially) IC\u2019s greatest club\nand/or society, the veterans of IC\nfootball were finally able to squeeze\nback into their footy kits ready for\nthe battle to begin. The highlight\nof the opening round of fixtures\nthrown up by the ULU Supercomputer was the most intense of rivalries \u2013 an inter-IC derby.\nA 3-0 pre-season friendly victory\nfor the 5ths in this same fixture,\nfour days earlier, meant that the\ngame was sure to be a cracker. The\n4th team aching for revenge and\nthe 5th\u2019s desperatation to prove the\nfriendly win was no fluke. Even the\nnew boys could tell how much pride\nwas at stake in this one.\nThe 5th team entered the game\nwith the same rope-a-dope strategy\nthat served them so well in the earlier encounter \u2013 let the 4ths come\nat them all guns blazing, roll with\nthe punches and then bang! Hit\nthem on the counter. Sure enough\nthe 4ths shot out of the blocks; unfortunately for the 5th team master\nplan, this time they managed to\nscore. Twice.\nThe first goal, from a great cross\nby Sam Rickards, was somehow\npoked in at the back stick by a well-marked Tariq. The second 4ths\ngoal followed shortly afterwards\nas Chris was picked out unmarked\nfrom a half-cleared corner and\na nice run along the by-line was\nmatched by a cool finish. Oops. 2-0\ndown. This never happened to Muhammed Ali.\nSometimes, however, football is\nabout more than skill. A dogged 5th\nteam managed to reach half time\nwithout conceding further, and\ncaptain Gui\u2019s passion-charged halftime team talk stirred something\nwithin the hearts and loins of the\n5ths.\nA changed 5th team started to win\nsome challenges in midfield and finally managed to start to pass the\nball about. Early in the second half,\n5th team pressure saw a seemingly\nfair goal ruled out for a marginal\noffside after excessive 4th team\nwhinging. This only served to delay\nthe inevitable as James Long sped\nthrough the heart of the 4th team\ndefence to bury a great shot past\npoor Mike Pursey. Barely seconds\nImperial men\u2019s football 4ths\ndominate St George 2nds\nJames Skeen\nIC men play with each other\nlater and the 5ths had equalised as\nScott finished off a rampaging run\nwith a neat finish.\nWithin the space of 10 minutes the\ngame had completely turned on its\nhead, as now it was the 4th teams\nturn to hang on. They couldn\u2019t quite\nmanage however, and 5ths captain\nGui completed a magnificent comeback with what turned out to be the\nwinning goal, rounding the keeper\nand rolling the ball over the line, before succumbing to a bout of cramp\nduring his celebration. Ten nervous minutes remained, but the 5th\nteam hardcore defending meant\n3-2 was the way the match ended.\nFrenzied scenes of celebration met\nthe final whistle as the 5ths gloated and rubbed their victory in the\nfaces of the gutted 4th teamers.

There,\ninside the heavy steel doors, we\nwere faced with a monstrous tirade of inflatables, ditches, strong\nholds, netting, tankers, sand bags,\nbunkers \u2026 and bodies. This was\nwar..of a paintballing nature! After a safety briefing that consisted\nmainly of, \u201c please don\u2019t shoot the\nroof or the marshals, but you can\nshoot anything else!\u201d, we donned\nour all in ones, found Darth Vaderlike masks and we were away! First\nwe had a few games of capture the\nflag, just enough time to test out our\nsemi-automaticrifles,itappearsthe\ngeologists may have gained an upper hand on these games\u2026 but no\none is really sure! Then we moved\non to different field protecting our\nstrong houses from invasions by\nboth sides. After some pretty chilling battle cries from Burg, Steve,\nTom and others (difficult to tell with\nmasks on!!), the Materials crew\nmanaged to annihilate the geologists and stormed their castle, winning the game. Credit must be given to all those who \u201cdrew\u201d fire by\nrunning around the battle field and\nthen \u201cre-charging\u201d their lives, it is\nhard to say how much paintballs really hurt, especially on the neck and\nhands. After a few more games involving bombs, flags and diving into\nsand, we moved on to the final field\nwhich was the most challenging,\nand most realistic\u2026 those trenches\nreally smelt; years of built up paint!!\nThe geologist one the first round of\nsave the package.. by sneakily grabbing it and then holding their own\nextremely well. Also the game of\nsave the president was entertain-ing.. which the materials group\nnearly own, only to be stopped by a\nvivacious Satan, who prevented entry to the safe bunker! (That REALLY hurt guys!!). The last round was\na one on one round, so every one\nwas an enemy, this caused multiple\ncasualties, and even more bruises!\nAfter all the games had finished (I\nam reliably informed) that the materials group won 5-3, all players\nput up a damn good fight, and have\nthe battle scars (bruises) to prove\nit! We all had an awesome time, and\nhere\u2019s to many a re-match in the\nnear future.. maybe we can challenge CGCU nest time instead.. after all we all know who will win!\nRSM wages war\nOranges and lemons, say the bells\nIf you were in college on Wednesday, 25th October, you may well have\nheard bells ringing out in celebration of the college\u2019s Undergraduate\nGraduation Ceremony. The bells at\nthe top of the Queen\u2019s Tower are\nthe 7th heaviest set of 10 bells in the\nworld with the heaviest bell weighing nearly 2 tons. The bells were\ngiven as a present by an Australian\nmillionaire to Queen Victoria in 1892\nand because of this, they are unusual\nin the way they remain the personal\nproperty of the Queen.\nBells are found the world over, but\nthe style of ringing that you hear\nin English churches (and of course\nthe Queen\u2019s Tower) is unique to this\ncountry. Bellringing started in the\nsixteenth century and has continued\nto this day, with ringers using the\nsame techniques and music as was\ndeveloped all those years ago. Today\nthere are thousands of people of all\nages ringing in churches throughout\nthe country, including student societies at many British universities.\nThe University of London Society\nof Change Ringers (ULSCR) is one\nof the oldest student ringing socie-ties, having existed continuously for\nover sixty years and remains very\nactive to this day. There are regular\npractices and ringing trips which\nare always followed by a pint or two\n(or three) in a nearby pub. Bellringers do not have to be very strong\nor musically minded and ringing\nwith a university society is a fantastic way to meet people and to get\nout and about in places all over the\ncountry. In the last year alone there\nhave been trips to Lundy Island,\nDorset and Birmingham. Also, the\nannual inter-university competition\n(and piss up!) takes place this year\nin Cambridge and the ULSCR are\nthe current reigning champions.\nHowever, ringing within the ULSCR\nis not just limited to church bells,\nhandbells are also an important\npart of the life of the society. Just before Christmas, handbells are used\nin the ULSCR concert when carols\nare rung around the Christmas tree\nin Trafalgar Square to entertain\nthe masses doing their Christmas\nshopping.\nHowever, bellringing is only part\nof the story when it comes to ULSCR activities. Whether it is a trip to\na West End show, a treasure hunt\naround the city or a \u201chit the dancefloor\u201d clubbing event, there is something for everybody. This term alone\nthere are plans for a Freshers\u2019 reception where anybody new to the\nsociety gets free food and drink all\nnight, a bonfire night trip, a Christmas party and the annual dinner\nand disco.\nPerhaps then, if you heard the\n29\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES clubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nEleanor Jay\nThe huge, very loud bells in the roof space of the Queen\u2019s Tower\nQueen\u2019s Tower bells being rung on\nCommemoration Day or will listen\nagain when they are rung for Prince\nCharles\u2019s birthday on the 14th and\nagain for the Queen\u2019s Wedding Anniversary on the 20th November, you\nwill spare a thought for the ringers\nwho are keeping this ancient tradition alive.\nIf you are a ringer, or interested in\njust learning more about bellringing\nthe ULSCR is contactable via email\nat secretary@ulscr.org.uk or on the\nwebsite www.ulscr.org.uk. Alternatively, come along to a practice night\non Thursday evenings from 7pm at\nSt Olave\u2019s church, Hart Street (near\nTower Hill tube station) and you will\nreceive a warm welcome, whether\nyou have never touched a bell rope\nbefore, or can conduct peals of London Surprise Maximus!\nPeter Jasper\n\n"

Coffee Break can\nexclusively reveal that he has bug-gered off onto I\u2019m a Celebrity, Get\nMe Out of Here due to the sizeable\npay-packet he would be receiving\nfrom it, and therefore he has left a\nvoid in Felix that many have always\nthought could not be filled (due to\nthe size of the Hoff\u2019s monstrous\nloins).\nLuckily for all of you, however,\nthat\u2019s false, as I\u2019ve decided to hop\nover from writing the common\nsense column (or what the Comments Editor called satire) to doing\nCoffee Break. I have to say that although he has left a legacy behind,\nhe really didn\u2019t have much sub-stance, and his loins weren\u2019t as big\nas mine. Think of it this way \u2013 we\nvoted him back for another year\nwith Felix (only just, fending off Optimus Prime) and he just buggered\noff without saying goodbye. Basically, I\u2019m far better. Hear me roar.\nSo stand straight when I\u2019m talking\nto you!\nAnyhow, onto business, so listen\nup \u2013 I was looking forward (some-what) to returning to Imperial for\nanother year of soaking up knowledge from friendly professors and\ngetting ever closer to obtaining\nmy degree (or not, pending alcohol consumption). After a long and\ngruelling battle with several estate\nagents, a landlord or two, and several bed and breakfasts (don\u2019t ask!),\nI managed to get a nice little place\njust a stone\u2019s throw away from College. I was ready to attempt to do\nsome sort of work \u2013 but before all\nthose dreams were duly shattered\nas I walked onto campus, I was\nblinded as I walked onto Upper\nDalby Court, where bright blues\nand the new addition of greens and\npinks of the building opposite absolutely wreaked havoc on my retinas.\nAfter dropping to the ground and\nquickly donning some Ray-Bans, I\ndecided that it was probably something to do with the BioMedical Engineering department\u2019s \u201cRestore\nsight to the blind\u201d campaign or similar \u2013 Stevie Wonder could see those\ncolours, for Christ\u2019s sake.\nA little digging revealed the architect responsible for this interesting\nnew addition to college was a bloke\ncalled Sheppard Robson. This is\nall well and good, frankly because\nwhen I run out of red and blue in\nmy colouring pencil set and want\nto doodle in lectures, I would also\nnaturally reach for the Barbie pink\nand Lime-on-acid. However, what\nI can\u2019t figure out is why somebody\nhas budgeted \u00a35.7m for the project,\nwhich was due to be finished in\nApril 2006, although it\u2019s been closed\noff on a few weekends and work (in-cluding the lovely pink thing that\nsits on top of the building) seems to\nbe ongoing periodically.\nI\u2019m not sure if this surpasses the\nlittle civil engineering mishap of\nforgetting to factor in the weight of\nwater in the swimming pool in the\nold leisure centre (whoops), forcing the pool to be built in the basement instead of its original location\non the first floor, but the new one\ndefinitely looks the part. Sitting opposite \u2018the blue cube\u2019, the pink and\ngreen seems to fit in. It\u2019s also attached to the Royal School of Mines,\nand I can assure everyone reading\nthis that the RSM had nothing to do\nwith what happened next door.\nThis naturally prompted me to\ntake a look around College and examine the architecture present in\na little more detail. Given what I\u2019ve\nalready seen, the results weren\u2019t\nthat surprising \u2013 it looks like a hundred years\u2019 worth of buildings, past\nand present, were dumped on a\nblock behind the Science Museum\nand left there as Imperial College.\nIn a way, I\u2019m thankful that not everything looks the same, but at the\nsame time we not only possess the\ncure-the-blind architecture, oh no,\nwe also have in our inventory a\ncouple of buildings \u2013 physicists look\naway now \u2013 that look, from the out-side, so dreary and uninspiring that\nI could swear the architect was the\nsame guy who designed the office\nfor Dilbert, minus the cat, dog, and\nthe guy with his hair on fire.\nThis, incidently, also gave me inspiration for this year\u2019s first FUCWIT competition. How well do you\nknow your way around Imperial\nCollege and what each department\nlooks like? It\u2019s time to find out this\nweek.\nAnswers:\nLet\u2019s start off easy because I don\u2019t want anyone to have no points after the first round.\nThat would just make you sad and pathetic.\nPossibly the centrepiece of the Imperial\ncampus. Mainly there to annoy the rest of us\nwith constant chiming on special occasions.\nWelcome to Nerd Central a.k.a Cram-City\na.k.a the answer! The stench of curry from\nlast year\u2019s cram season still fills the air.\nThe Sarge pauses to take a look at the building that whistles on a windy day (it really\ndoes). What\u2019s this place called?\nPlenty of Imperial students have many stories to tell about this place, but currently the\nentrance is blocked off.\nSarge pauses to take a look at the home\nof its slightly more drunken, lower class\ncitizens. He makes a hasty getaway.\nWelcome to the Biomedical Engineer\u2019s\nproject for restoring sight to the blind. You\ncan be excused for not wanting to know this.\nThe only place at Imperial College you\u2019ll ever\nsee a naked lady. Where is the Sarge currently jerking off?\nOne final extra hard bonus question. What\nis the name of the building, and what lies\nbeyond these double doors?\n1 2 3\n4 5 6\n7 8 9\nSergeant Hartman\nWelcome back to this year\u2019s Felix\nUniversity/College-Wide Invitational Tournament, or FUCWIT.\nThe format of this year\u2019s competition is going to be a little spiced\nup, because I know for a fact that\ntoo many things given to you all\nlast year were so easily searchable on the internet. The Hoff\ngot more than a little suspicious.\nAnyway, here\u2019s how it works:\nYou need a team name. Think\nof one. Every week, make sure\nyou include your team name\nwhen you email in the answers\nto coffee.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nYou get 2 marks for each ques-tion. I\u2019ll give one mark for what I\ndeem to be partially correct an-swers, or for particularly clever\nwrong answers.\nThis year there may be, but\nnot always, secret bonus marks\non one or more of the questions\nbased on the quality of your\nanswer, again to make things\ninteresting.\nWe\u2019ll always give the maximum\nnumber of obtainable points each\nround, to keep you guessing as\nto how many you can get.\nThis week, we\u2019re going to give\nyou nine different photos of places around Imperial College. Your\njob is to give us the name of the\nbuilding (i.e. not the name of the\ndepartment(s) that use it). If you\ncan\u2019t find the name, you may\nget one mark for other relevant\ninformation so give it a shot. So,\nhow well do you know really\nImperial?\nThe rules of the game\n\n"

The Britney-bashing Cry\nMe a River helped blur the line between ballad and club record and\nenabled Justin to excel on a slow\nsong despite his weak falsetto.\nThe emotion and skill which was\nlacking in the vocal performance was just\npoured into the\nlush production and the\ninternational\nhit was\nborn.\nMy Love\nis a close\nrelative but\nnot so\nclose\nas to\ndis-So many fish puns, so little time\nSohodolls\nNo Regrets\n(Filthy Pretty)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nVarious Artists\nJanie Jones (Strummerville)\n(B-Unique)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nThe 30th October will see the release of single Janie Jones originally performed by the Clash, now\nre-recorded by a number of artists\nfor charity. Babyshambles, Carl\nBarat, The Rakes, We Are Scientists and The Kooks are just a few\nof the artists who appear on the sin-gle. On the b-side is a solo version\nof the track by Pete Doherty which\nwe happened to get hold of. Now I\npersonally love the Libertines, but\nnever really latched onto Babyshambles. However, given what the\nguys pulling himself out of, I was\nimpressed. He sounds back on form\nand I thoroughly enjoyed the track.\nObviously the song itself is a piece\nof songwriting genius by The Clash\nand only they can perform it to per-fection, but I feel he does it justice.\nAll proceeds from the release will\ngo to Strummerville (Joe Strummer\u2019s foundation for new music)\nSam Lombard\nThe Good, The Bad & The Queen\nHerculean\n(Parlophone)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nI have never been much of a fan of\nBlur.Mostoftheirsupposedclassics\nleave me rather underwhelmed, although some are pleasant enough.\nGorillaz, also, do nothing for me, despite my usual appreciation of Danger Mouse's work. As such, I have\nnever understood why so many\npeople consider Damon Albarn to\nbe some sort of musical genius,\nand I certainly wasn't expecting\nmuch from his unnamed new band.\nHowever, on the strength of this\nfirst single from their forthcoming\nconcept album about London; The\nGood, The Bad & The Queen, I have\nto admit to being very pleasantly\nsurprised.\nHerculean is a whimsical, hopeful\nsong with an almost ethereal quality to it; there is a simple, almost\nstark quality to the melody, and\nthe harmonies are equally under-stated. The lyrics speak of canals,\ngasworks and the welfare state and\nin a few brief stanzas succeed in\nevoking a strong sense of place. As\nsuch, lyrically, it might not appeal so\nstrongly to those not as enamoured\nof the Capital, but it is at heart an\nastounding piece of music.\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nlive review\nWalter Trout and The Radicals\nMean Fiddler\nTo most Imperial students the\nname Walter Trout probably sounds\nlike little more than a crap name\nfor a fish. However, for fans of contemporary blues-rock, this guy and\nhis band, The Radicals, are one\nof the most exciting blues outfits\naround, with a highly enviable live\nreputation.\nAll of this was totally unknown\nto me when a couple of weeks ago\na friend asked me if I wanted to go\nand see a blues guitarist called Walter Trout. Intrigued by the name I\nagreed, despite having only a passing interest in blues music, and boy\nwas I impressed with the result.\nPut simply, the gig was awesome.\nThe guy clearly has a large set of\nvery devoted fans and the reception afforded to him before, during and after his performance was\nprobably the warmest I\u2019ve seen at\nthe Mean Fiddler, and not without\nmerit. From the first minute, the\nTrout stormed through a selection\nof blues and rock songs, with a hefty\ndose of some very entertaining and\nexciting improvisation thrown in.\nA technical fault with the band\u2019s\nkeyboard equipment meant the\nkeyboard player was redundant for\nthe duration of the gig, so the band\nperformed as a power trio, something the Trout declared he hadn\u2019t\ndone since he was 18 years old, an\nage which judging by his appearance was probably a few decades\nago. The result of this was a gig\nplayed louder, faster and heavier\nthan normal, with both audience\nand band quite clearly loving it. The\nset-list included some classic Trout\nsongs from his first albums as well\nas a few from his latest album Full\nCircle. Highlights included the\nsong Walking in the Rain, and\nsome blazing improvisations, with\nthe Trout declaring, \u201cFor 20 seconds in that song I was hallucinat-ing. I thought I was Jimmy Page\u201d.\nIndeed his guitar playing was top\nclass all night, and at times reaching the kind of speed that no shred\nguitarist would be ashamed of, but\nalways in his own blues-rock style.\nOn the down side, whilst the lack\nof keyboard perhaps made for a\nmore \u2018fun\u2019 gig, the music did at\ntimes seem slightly bare without\nthem, and it was a shame the band\nweren\u2019t able to perform as they had\nplanned.\nOverall though it was a great gig\nwith a lot of memorable moments,\nand which was a lot more fun than\nI had expected. I would strongly\nadvise anyone with even a passing\ninterest in blues or blues-rock to go\nand see Walter Trout if he comes to\nLondon again \u2013 I know I will.\nChristopher Thomas\nNow for our weekly singles round-up\nJustin Timberlake\nMy Love\n(Sony BMG)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nmiss it as lacking in originality.\nFrom the manic laughter that goes\non in the background during the\nchorus to the rap verse, courtesy\nof the Rubberband Man himself,\nT.I. all tricks available are used to\nsell this song and truth be told it all\nworks very well. My Love is destined to hang about at the top of the\ncharts for a while.\nFans that are able to forgive the\ncheesy come-ons, see past the little boy who cried to his mommy on\nPunk'd and left Janet to take the\nblame for the infamous \u2018Superboob\u2019\nstunt might actually take him seriously in the role of lover man. In\nJustin\u2019s best interest we\u2019ll just pretend the awful Let Me Talk To You\n(Interlude) rap didn\u2019t happen.\nJemil Salami\ntinues into the chorus, as she chants\n\"Take me, I want a test. Take me, I'll\nhave no regrets\" over an annoyingly\nwonderful synth chord pattern. The\nmusic is clean, sparse and Kraftwerkian in it's clinicalness, but the\nlyrics are seductive filth.\nThe whole thing is very self-conciously cool and comes over a\nbit gittishly trendy-scenester so I\nfound myself disliking the single on\nprinciple, which is wrong because\nit's really rather good. Plus they're\na bit like Goldfrapp, but sluttier\n\u2013 which can only be good.\nAdrian Nightingale\nRICHARD BOYLES\nHe plays much better than he looks, but then that can\u2019t be hard\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n14 felix\nNext week we will be having\nour second Felix Music Monthly.

Participants must wear trainers.\nTHE GAME\nThe object of the game is to eliminate all opposing players by getting them \u201cOUT\u201d.\nThis may be done by:\n1. Hitting an opposing player with a LIVE thrown ball below the shoulders.\n2. Catching a LIVE ball thrown by your opponent before it touches the ground.\nDefinition of LIVE: A ball that has been thrown and has not touched anything, including the floor/ground,\nanother ball, another player, official or other item outside of the playing field (wall, ceiling, etc)\nBOUNDARIES\nDuring play, all players must remain within the boundary lines. Players may leave the boundaries through\ntheir end-line only to retrieve stray balls. They must also return through their end-line.\nTHE OPENING RUSH\nGame begins by placing the dodgeballs along the center line \u2013 three (3) on one side of the center hash\nand three (3) on the other. Players then take a position behind their end line. Following a signal by the\nofficial, teams may approach the centerline to retrieve the balls. This signal officially starts the contest.\nTeams may only retrieve the three (3) balls to their right of the center hash. Once a ball is retrieved it must\nbe taken behind the attack-line before it can be legally thrown.\nTIMING AND WINNING A GAME\nThe first team to legally eliminate all opposing players will be declared the winner. A 10-minute time limit\nhas been established for each contest. If neither team has been eliminated at the end of the 10 minutes,\nthe team with the greater number of players remaining will be declared the winner. In the case of an equal\nnumber of players remaining after regulation, a 1-minute sudden-death overtime period will be played.\nTIMEOUTS AND SUBSTITUTIONS\nEach team will be allowed one (1) 30 second timeout per game. At this time a team may substitute players\ninto the game.\nFIVE-SECOND VIOLATION\nIn order to reduce stalling, a violation will be called if a team in the lead controls all six (6) balls on their\nside of the court for more than 5 seconds.\nRULE ENFORCEMENT\nPlayers will be expected to rule whether or not a hit was legal or whether they were legally eliminated.\nAll contests will be supervised by a referee. The referee\u2019s responsibility will be to rule on any situation in\nwhich teams cannot agree. The referee\u2019s decision is final, with absolutely no exceptions.\nCODE OF CONDUCT\n1.

As of October 2006, according to\nrightmove.co.uk, the average asking price for a property was nearly\n\u00a3220,000 and this is even higher in\nGreater London, at over \u00a3300,000.\nThese prices are amplified in some\nareas; for example, in September in\nKensington and Chelsea, the average asking price jumped 10% to just\nshort of \u00a31 Million. The main cause\nof this is a lack of houses of the right\nquality in the right areas.\nFor first-time buyers these prices\nare proving just too high. First-time\nbuyers are now borrowing 3.27\ntimes their income on a mortgage.\nImperial College Graduates, who\nearn the most of all graduates, last\nyear averaged starting salaries of\n\u00a325,780, which even with borrowing\nover 3 times would leave them with\na house well below the national\naverage.\nAll this is not to say it is impossible to get yourself on to the property ladder once you graduate. The\ngovernment has recently raised\nthe threshold on stamp duty, in an\nattempt to make it easier to buy\ncheaper houses for which first-time\nbuyers demand.\nThe government has also just\nintroduced a scheme called Open\nMarket HomeBuy designed at providing an additional 25% of the value of homes in interest-free loans\nfor key workers.\nMany people rely on their parents\nto give them a little boost. With the\naverage couple needing \u00a329,000 for\ndeposit and stamp duty on a house,\npeople spend years saving up just\nso they can take out a mortgage.\nThis is where mum and dad join\nin, helping towards the deposit, or\neven contributing to mortgage re-payments. Most parents get this\nmoney from the big increase in\nvalue of their house, completing the\nproperty circle.\nIncreasingly another way of gaining a mortgage is becoming popu-lar. Getting a house and sharing\nthe mortgage with another person\noften allows someone to get a share\nof their first property. However this\nhas many pitfalls. Finding someone\nto share a mortgage with requires\na lot of trust. It is very difficult to\nget out of the mortgage if you cannot stand to live with each other:\nyou are liable for any of their shortcomings in payments, and you both\nhave to agree what to do with the\nhouse further down the line.\nWhilst it can be tough to get on\nthe property ladder it is definitely\npossible. Once you do get yourself\na nice little place, you can sit back\nand reap the benefits of increasing house prices whilst others are\ntrying to get themselves their first\nhouse.\nCity explained: hedging with swaps\nOptions and futures allow the opportunity to hedge price risks, swaps\nallow the opportunity to hedge risk\nagainst cash flows. At their most\nsimple, swaps do exactly what they\nsay: they swap the cash flow of, say,\ncompany A with those of company\nB. Inherently, they are not traded\non exchanges and are classified\nas over the counter (OTC) deriva-tives, contracts which are structured specifically for their primary\nmarket, by investment banks. As\nsuch, they cannot be bought or sold\non the open market and represent\nflows which are of course very specific to the counterparties involved\nin the transactions.\nThere are three main types of\nswaps: interest-rate, currency, and\nequity swaps. In an interest-rate\nswap (IRS), there is a transfer of\nthe interest rate paid on borrow-ings and loans by company A and\ncompany B. Why would companies want to swap interest rates?\nJust like options and futures help\neliminate price risks, interest-rate\nswaps help eliminate risk to interest rates. Typically, in an IRS, a\ncompany will exchange the floating\ninterest rate (i.e. variable market\nrate), usually LIBOR plus 50 basis\npoints, to a fixed interest rate. LIBOR is short for London Interbank\nOffered Rate, a rate that banks offer each other on borrowings on the\nLondon interbank money market.\nThe British Bankers Association\npublishes different rates with different maturities; for example, there\nexists a daily LIBOR, three-month,\nWhen you first think of cartels, it\nconjures the image of an illegal\ndrug empire in the deepest jungle of\nSouth America with tight ranks and\nextreme rules, such as the Medellin\nCartel. Whilst a cartel in business\nis unlikely to result in deaths, it can\ninvolve the exchanging of brown\nenvelopes and secret meetings.\nA cartel is a group of independent businesses whose goals are to\njointly raise prices and income, limit supply, or eliminate competition,\nusually in a market where there\nare only a few sellers, for their ad-vantage. Such cartels are illegal in\nmost countries; however, they continue to exist, particularly interna-tionally, where nations have immunity under public international law.\nIn the UK, the Office of Fair Trading enforces European Community\n(EC) and UK competition laws in\nparticular the Cartel and Competition Act 1998.\nPerhaps the most renowned and\nmost commonly used example of\na cartel is that of the Organization\nof Petroleum Exporting Countries\n(OPEC). It is has 11 member state,\nand was founded by Libya, Iran,\nIraq, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.\nIts members are very important to\nJayraj Choksi\nBusiness Correspondent\nsix-month, one-year, five-year \u2013 any\nperiod up to 50 years. Basis points\nsimply mean 0.01% (1bps = 0.01%).\nIt is worth noting that the principal\nborrowing, the money on which the\ninterest rate is being paid, is not the\nfocus of the swap, only the interest\nrates themselves. As with cash settled options and futures, a swap is\nsettled in net. So for example if A\nowes B 1.5% and B owes A 3%, B\nsimply pays A 1.5%.\nCurrency swaps employ a similar\nstructure; however, they relate to\nthe conversion of one currency to\nanother. In effect, currency swaps\nallow companies to borrow debt\nin one country, where it may be\ncheaper, and then swap it into the\ncurrency they need it in. This can\nbe a dangerous game as the company has debt obligations in the currency it has initially borrowed in,\nand if there are no revenue streams\nin that currency to cover for the re-payments, the company would then\nhave to convert money, exposing it\nto foreign exchange rates.\nA landmark currency swap occurred in 1981 between IBM and\nthe World Bank, arranged by Salomon Brothers (now a part of Citigroup). IBM had raised debt principal in Deutsche Marks (DEM) and\nSwiss Francs (CHF), and swapped\nthem into dollars (USD) to finance\ntheir various corporate ventures.\nThe problem for IBM was that to\nrepay its DEM and CHF loans it\nwould rack up considerable transaction costs when buying the DEM\nand CHF to repay their loans, pay\na call premium (i.e. pay more than\nmarket price), issue bonds in USD\nthen convert the money to DEM/\n4 felix Friday 3 November 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nthe production of oil, accounting for\nabout 60% of the worlds known oil\nreserves and 41.7% of the oil production in 2005. Its main aim is to\nprotect the interests of its nations\nby controlling the amount of oil its\nmembers output. Whilst this might\nsound all bad and mean high prices\nfor us, OPEC also tries to keep the\noil market steady by altering its output and can even increase output to\ntry and absorb a sudden market increase in the price of oil.\nCloser to home, earlier this year,\nmany airlines, including British\nAirways, had their offices raided by\nthe EC and the Department of Justice and are still under investiga-tion. This was to look into possible\nprice fixing of fuel surcharges and\nother costs related to cargo. With\nthe EC imposing a maximum fine of\nup to 10% of annual sales, and with\nthe negative publicity, this could be\ncostly to the airlines involved.\nTypically cartels have a very short\nlife. It is very easy for one member\nto break production limits and produce more in attempt to make more\nmoney for itself. As soon as this\nhappens, the cartel will become in-effective, and normal market forces\nwill begin to take over.\nCHF and pay capital gains taxes if\nthey made any money in the proc-ess. At the same time, the World\nBank wanted to borrow DEM and\nCHF to lend to its customers, and\ndoing so on the open market would\ninvolve issuing DEM and CHF\nbonds, which would have had large\nissuing costs.\nUnder the swap, the World Bank\nassumed IBM\u2019s DEM and CHF obligations and borrowed in USD to\npay off IBM\u2019s loan. Actually, it delivered the money straight to IBM.\nIn the meanwhile, IBM paid off the\nWorld Bank\u2019s USD loan. The currency rates swung in IBM\u2019s favour,\nand Salomon Brothers made a lot of\nmoney.\nFinally, equity swaps. These are\nactually a subset of a broader type\nof swaps called total return swaps.\nIn this type of swap, party A holds\ncertain assets, say shares, and pays\nany returns those assets make to\nparty B, who in return pay A inter-est. In essence, party B has gained\nexposure to the price risk without\nactually holding the asset, but any\ncapital gain made from the assets\nmust also be given up by A to B. Any\nlosses are paid by B to A.\nIn short, swaps allow companies\nto hedge their operational risks and\nallow them to cut many of the costs\nassociated with raising debt.\nGet on the property ladder Analysis: oil cartels\nThe average couple borrows more than \u00a328,000 from parents\nPaul Estruch\nBusiness Correspondent\nOPEC is the oil cartel responsible for half the world\u2019s oil output\nCurrency swaps play an increasing role in hedging all kinds of risk\nThe average property in the UK is now worth in excess of \u00a3200,000\n\n"

The allegations\ncentre around the post of Deputy\nPresident (Graduate Students), a\npost currently occupied by Shama\nRahman. Ms Rahman apparently\nput forwards a proposal to the Executive Committee, via Miss Misbahuddin, that suggested she take up\nher position in September, rather\nthan in July with the other sabbs.\nThis was to allow Miss Rahman to\nwork on completing her MSc during\nJuly and August; refusal of the proposal may have meant Miss Rahman would have to step down.\nMiss Rahman claims to have spoken to Miss Misbahuddin about the\nproposal while she was deliberating over whether to stand for the\nposition. However, the first paper\nput before Exec by Miss Misbahuddin was only a day before the final\ncandidates\u2019 meeting that would\nallow the votes to be counted. As\nsuch, only 24 hours were allowed\nfor discussion of the paper, which\nwas done by \u201celectronic meeting\u201d,\nsomething that is neither allowed\nnor forbidden by the Union\u2019s consti-tution. The proposal was rejected by\n6 votes to 5, and shortly afterwards\nanother proposal was circulated\nafter the final candidates\u2019 meeting\nwith a very short deadline. Again,\nthe paper was discussed electroni-cally, with most of the votes arriving after the deadline. The proposal\nwas passed 6 to 5, but some Exec\nmembers were unhappy with the\nshort deadlines, lack of discussion\nand apparently forcefulness of Miss\nMisbahuddin and leaked the closed\nsession emails.\nOn learning of the leak, Miss Misbahuddin told Exec that she \u201cno\nlonger trusted them\u201d with closed\nsession business, and that she\nwould decide on such business by\nherself, without consulting the com-mittee, which is unconstitutional.\nThe two proposals led to confusion\nas the new sabbs arrived this year,\nwith the team being presented with\nthe first, rejected proposal rather\nthan the second, accepted propos-al. The former said that the DPGS\nwould be absent for the whole of\nAugust, when in fact she would be\nabsent for the last three weeks of\nAugust, and work two days a week\nduring July and the first week of\nAugust.\nThis reporter was unable to contact Miss Misbahuddin, but spoke\nto the previous incumbent of the\npost of Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies), Simon Matthews. Mr\nMatthews said that he only knew\nabout Miss Rahman\u2019s proposal 24\nhours before the candidates\u2019 meet-ing, when it was brought to Exec,\nand added that he felt \u201cit [the deci-sion] was definitely rushed\u201d. Commenting on the threat to conduct\nclosed session Exec business without consulting the committee, Mr\nMatthews said: \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure\nthat anything was decided outside\nof Exec that should have been discussed.\u201d He also hinted that he\nwas being kept in the dark about\nMiss Misbahuddin\u2019s decisions: \u201cI\u2019m\naware of a few things (I\u2019m not going\nto be specific) that I wasn\u2019t told at\nthe time but would have expected\nto have been.\u201d However, he said\nthat he felt the threat of unilateral\naction was more of a \u201cthreat/loss of\ntemper\u201d than a serious move.\nHe was supportive of Miss Misbahuddin\u2019s attempts to get the\nproposal approved, calling it \u201cwellintentioned\u201d. However, he was critical of the handling of the second\nproposal: \u201cExec certainly had no\ntime to consider it properly, and\nthere was a significant amount of\npressure brought to bear to accept\nit. With hindsight... they should have\nstuck to their original decision.\u201d\nThe reasons for the current sabb\nteam bringing up this matter have\nbeen questioned by a number of\nhacks. Ostensibly, the paper was\nbrought to try to amend the constitution to clarify the situation with\nelectronic meetings, and to reconsider the role of the DPGS. The\npaper included several options for\na future Graduate Students rep-resentative, such as changing the\nstart date, making it part-time sabbatical position akin to a Faculty\nUnion President, and renaming\nthe position to GSA Chair. These\nconsiderations will be investigated\nover the next few weeks by the sabb\nteam.\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-chief\n18\npage\nTravel\nLord Robert Winston, took part in a special lecture entitled\n\u2018Playing God?\u2019 on Tuesday evening inside the Great Hall.

Perhaps\nyour club or society is organising\na disco? Perhaps you want to host\nthe party to end all parties? Do you\nneed a sound system so magnificent that the bass blows everyone\nin attendance away? Perhaps you\nneed to hire a DJ? Are you a DJ\nwho wants to play at a disco? Well\nthen IC Radio is the club for you.\nWe have a dedicated disco team\nthat hire out our impressive sound\nsystem to clubs and societies for\ntheir parties, socials and other\nnon-descript gatherings of booze-hounds. For those of you who are\ntechnical-minded, it includes two\nTechnics 1210 turntables, a Behringer 2500 Amp, some impressively large speakers, a Denon dual\nCD mixer and a four channel Denon mixer. We\u2019ve also got monitor\nspeakers, microphones and other\nessential equipment. All of which\nadds up to tremendous aural pleasure for all of those in attendance.\nIn essence, ICRadio can provide\nyour club, society or just your group\nof friends with all the equipment\nyou will need and a DJ who cuts all\nthe mustard in sight. All of which\ncomes at a very reasonable price.\nWe\u2019ve already helped organise\nfour discos this term, like the Civ- Lisa and Seb DJing at one of many wild CivSoc boat parties\nSoc Christmas Party and the Erasmus party, and have more lined up.\nOne happy customer said, \u201cA live\nDJ really improved the atmosphere\nand provided a focus for the party\u201d,\nand \u201cthe sound system and music were excellent.\u201d Another said,\n\u201cThat was the best disco I went to\nthat night!\u201d\nPerhaps you are an experienced\nDJ, or want to become an experienced DJ, who plays at all the top-notch events that ICRadio enter-tain? Whether you\u2019re a professional\nor just another amateur who\u2019s never played before you could be DJing\nat one of these discos.\nICRadio is often called up by societies looking for DJs to play at their\nevents. DJing for ICRadio is not\nonly great fun, but for one night\u2019s\nwork you can earn yourself enough\ncash to pay for your next night out\nwith your friends (as long as you go\nto Cheapskates).\nMost of our work is cheesy old-school hits, modern pop and hip-hop, but we do get the occasional\ncall up for alternative or house mu-sic. The more people we have for\neach genre the more often we get\ninvited to perform at events.\nIf your society needs a sound\nsystem, or if you\u2019re up for some\nDJing, send an email to sebas-tian.kaminski@ic.ac.uk.\nMoon Unit: IC\u2019s favourite rock show\nUnder the guise of our superhero\nalter egos, SuperDan and Essex\nBoi, we aim to bring you the greatest in guitar sounds. Well, sort of.\nThe music on Moon Unit is nothing\nother than our taste, much like most\nshows on ICRadio. It is an amalgamation of the majority of what the\nmedia calls \u2018alternative\u2019. We call it\nmainstream rock, but we enjoy a\ndash of metal, a pinch of punk and\na dollop of electro all added into\nthe witch\u2019s cauldron for added fun,\ncraic and wonder.\nYou may have seen us at the\nFreshers\u2019 Fair. We did a live set on\nthe ICRadio stand from two until\nthree. If you do not remember us,\nwe were the two guys with appalling haircuts playing out the likes of\nThe Rapture, The Clash and The\nKillers whilst drinking some pints\nand shaking our jelly. We hope this\nencouraged you to sign up to follow\nin our footsteps.\nMoon Unit is now in its third year\nof operation and since its inception\nhas managed to become Imperial College\u2019s most listened to rock\nshow. However, none of our listeners ever want to tell us about the\nshow. So, before we start telling you\nwhy you too should become a Moon\nUniter, I ask anyone who listens to\nget in contact and start requesting\ntracks and generally telling us why\nwe are so much better than everyone else. Not that we are immodest,\nwe just state the facts. Though only\nthe facts that make us look good.\nOn a normal Moon Unit hour we\neach take over the show for a thirty-minute section, playing exclusively\nour own musical choice. SuperDan\nnormally sticks to the modern day\ntaking Moon Unit down a road filled\nwith the delights of 90s\u2019 Brit pop,\nsome mellow tunes and some turn-of-the-century metal. On the other\nend of the Unit, Essex Boi tends to\nstick to the older sounds. The 80s\u2019\npost-punk era, 70s\u2019 hard/psych-edelic rock and 60s\u2019 guitar pop\nseem to be the usual choice. The\nbest in Moon Unit music comes in\nthe crossover regions. The mainstream area in which we both like\nto delve out musical tastes is filled\nwith pleasures unknown. When one\nof us manages to find a song that we\nboth like the show tends to hit fifth\ngear. Within this limited category\nexists the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Bloc Party\nand anything but modern R\u2019n\u2019B.\nBasically, your staple diet of indie\ndance floor tracks and \u2018experimental\u2019 music will be catered for within\nour weekly hour of fun and games.\nAlongside the music there exists\nthe infamous Moon Unit banter. It\nis the repartee between the two of\nus that repeatedly brings our listeners back, begging for more. In\nshows gone by we have discussed\neverything from the merits of modern day R\u2019n\u2019B in the vein of those\nBeyonc\u00e9 types (we concluded that\nthere are none) to the always appropriate subject of coprophilia (I\nsuggest you Google that word if you\ndo not know it, but be warned, do\nnot do an image search).\nWe like to include a few regular\nfeatures in the show. We have had\nweekly interviews with pop and\nTV superstars Alvin and the Chipmunks, followed by their rendition\nof a famous song. Another piece\nSuperDan and Essex Boi: Their parents were fire and brimstone\nthat often rears its ugly head is\nNot On My Moon Unit. This is a little ditty where Essex Boi normally\nplays out a classic piece of hip-hop,\nreggae or Motown that is actually\ngood, unlike most of the rubbish\nfrom the mainstream \u2018urban\u2019 scene.\nFinally Dan\u2019s Shit Past involves SuperDan playing something that he\nliked when he was about thirteen\n(Blink 182 etc).\nWe also regularly run Moon Unit\nSpecials. This week saw a Halloween themed show that included\nsongs of a scary nature. Only songs\nthat contained lyrics of doom and\ndespair made the cut (except for\nEssex Boi\u2019s closing track). This\nspookfest included some of The\nJesus and Mary Chain, Nine Inch\nNails and Korn, for all your gothic\nmetal needs. Next week, though,\nwill see a return to our usual programming selection, what that includes even we do not know.\nFrankly we do not take ourselves\nseriously, but somehow have quite\na decent following and we enjoy\nourselves. Over the past years we\nfound that when it comes to making good shows professionalism is\nsecondary to making the listeners\nlaugh. So go and download our last\nshow, it is very good. Trust us.\nSebastian Kaminski\nHead of Discos\nIC Radio has the gear and the talent to provide you with a DJ and some banging tunes\nSuperDan and Essex Boi\nYou are rather lucky to go to Imperial, I can tell you this. But not\nfor any of the reasons you have\nheard before. You are lucky because Imperial College Radio is\nprobably the best student radio\nstation around. \u201cBut I hear it is\njust another student radio station\u201d you cry. Now that is just\nwrong. I have been told that we\nbroadcast more hours of original programming per year than\nmost, if not all, of our competitors\nin the capital. One of the best features on the ICRadio website is\nour listen again service. We keep\nevery show presented in the last\nfour years and they are all available for you to download. So if\nyou visit us at the award-winning\nwww.icradio.com you can hear\nall the shows you have missed\nover the years. The main aspect\nis for us to create and broadcast\nradio shows. A lot of people tell\nme that they could never do a radio show because they would feel\ntoo self-conscious, but even when\nthe shyest of my friends guest on\nmy show, they become animated\nchatterboxes the moment I flip\nthe On Air switch.\nAre you still not convinced that\nyou should be a part of ICRadio?\nI have more reasons. ICRadio is\nmostly filled with music lovers,\nme included. But, and this is a\nbig but, the main difference between ICRadio and other music\nrelated clubs and societies is the\ndistinct lack of music fascism.\nAny music sits perfectly with any\nother type, anywhere on ICRadio\nand we intend to keep it like that.\nICRadio has the likes of cheesy-poptastic School Daze (with\nresident schoolmasters Lisa\nBunclark and Seb Kaminski) sat\nright alongside the metal monster that is Iron Thursday, the\nbrainchild of Flangernon Lacy\nand Jurgen Grundleburger. Alex\nBaldwin (him from the Nightlife\nsection) and his buddy Matt Long\ncome in and play all kinds of odd\nsounds that I often find surprisingly pleasant on the interestingly titled Lazer Tiger vs. The Acid\nTripping Swamp Monkeys.\nShows are not our only out-put. Seb Kaminski is in charge\nof running the numerous events\nwe are hired to do by Imperial\u2019s\nother clubs and societies. Folake\nAdegbohun runs a music review\nteam that take all of the twenty to\nfifty CDs we are sent every week.\nOur members also get access to\nour professional recording stu-dio. Where some minor sucessful\nsongs have been recorded. On top\nof all of this our resident house\njunkie, James Yearsley, teaches\nthe finer points of turntablism to\nthose who are interested.\nHopefully you are convinced\nthat ICRadio is the best thing on\nEarth and that you want to join\nour noble cause. If you are suitably impressed email manager@\nicradio.com and I can get you\nrocking the airwaves within the\nweek.\nMike Higgins\nStation Manager\n\n"

Immediately the hairs on the back of your\nneck stand up as the huge drums\nand driving guitars throw you into\nthe opening vocals delivered so\neffortlessly by frontman Chino\nMoreno. It is the perfect opener to\nthe Sacramento quintet\u2019s Saturday\nNight Wrist, and what follows is a\nmixture of brutal riffs and ambient\nmelodies reminiscent of the heavily\nacclaimed White Pony and to some\nextent 2003\u2019s Deftones.\nBeware is a crushingly heavy,\nslow tempo, bass-driven song\nwhich leads the listener into the\nbrilliantly-sung chorus. There are\nsome beautifully melodic moments\non Saturday Night Wrist; from the\nhaunting opening atmosphere of\nCherry Wave to the vocal performance by Moreno on the first half\nof the final track, Riviere. However that\u2019s not to say this album\ndoesn\u2019t rock, the opening samples of Combat lead into aggressive vocals of Moreno screaming,\n\u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d. Rapture\nis full of driving riffs and uptempo\ndrum beats, and the breakdown in\nRat!Rats!Rats! is just plain brutal!\nThis song alone would satisfy any\npre-White Pony fan.\nThat\u2019snottosaythisalbumdoesn\u2019t\nhave its faults, in fact this is the album which almost broke the band.\nGuitarist Stef Carpenter admitted\non several occasions that they almost \u201cthrew Chino out\u201d, due to him\nleaving the recording of his vocals\nto tour with his side project, Team\nSleep. Indeed, as with the song\nLucky you on its predecessor, there\nis an obvious Team Sleep moment\non Saturday Night Wrist. Pink Cellphone features the vocals of Giant\nDrags\u2019 Anne Hardy, and seems out\nof place on the album. Not so much\na classic Deftones song, but more\nof an electronic beat over which\nHardy delivers weird spoken-word\nlyrics, at times cringingly explicit\nfor no real reason. There is also a\nguest appearance from System of\na Down\u2019s Serj Tankian on the track\nMei, which again seems pointless\nand out of place on a Deftones album and I feel they could have used\nbassist Chi Cheng\u2019s guttural vocals\non the heavier songs.\nOverall, Saturday Night Wrist\nmanages to perfectly balance the\nelements of the bands past to create an original sounding record in\na time when many of their contemporaries are content to re-package\nestablished, and often outdated,\ntrends. Whether Saturday Night\nWrist receives as much praise as\n2000\u2019s White Pony will remain to\nbe seen when it is released. In my\nopinion this album deserves to be\nranked within the top 3 of their back\ncatalogue.\nChristian Maine\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nO\nh my sweet Jesus\nof Nazareth \u2013 the\nfilm version \u2013 do\nwe have a lot of\nreviews for you this\nweek. Sorry about the anaemic\nstate of last week\u2019s music sec-tion, I had little time as I was at a\n(brilliant) gig and was feeling under the weather. Also, I apologise\nfor the focus on guitar bands, I\nwas trying to add a bit of a theme\nto tame the excellent yet random\nnature of this section.\nThis week we have some\nalbums ranging from the new\nDeftones album released this\nweek to an album from the summer getting some overdue atten-tion. In these album reviews we\ncover alt-rock, metal, indie-rock\nand R\u2019n\u2019B. Variety I believe is the\nspice of life (along with a pinch\nof nutmeg) so if you feel you can\nadd more variety then whip over\nsome reviews to us and we\u2019ll put\nthem in and keep you informed\nabout our reviewing possibilities.\nWe\u2019ve also got a singles round-up, and a live review of blues\ngreat, Walter Trout. I hope this\nmeaty selection is whetting\nyour appetite for the bonanza of\ncontent that will be November\u2019s\nFeMM or Felix Music Monthly.\nYes, we are staying true to our\nword and putting one out every\nmonth. Next week will be when\nyou can happily pull it out and\nstudy it in front of everyone, and\nyou can pick up FeMM out of\nFelix as well.\nFor next week we hope to have\nmore columns, reviews, features\nand listings. We are going to dissect music in hideously beautiful\nways for your reading pleasure.\nYou\u2019ll be baying for more by then\nend, and we might give it to you,\nyou dirty people.\nIn other news, we have another\nKids Will Be Skeletons gig night\nin the union on Sunday November 5th. If you are stuck for\nways to celebrate the murder of\ntrecherous Catholics, then come\non down. We want to celebrate\nrevolution as opposed to repression on this day. So we have two\nbands from France, the original\ncountry of revolution, coming\nover to play.\nEntry is \u00a33 for students and\n\u00a32.50 for alternative music and\njazz and rock society members.\nAgain the reason for the door\nprice is to cover the transport\nfor the French bands. Expect\na riotous night in the spirit of\nrevolution\nThis self-named album from the\nfour Atlanta sisters leaves nothing\nto the imagination. It is an un-en-couraging Jazzy Pha production.\nThis album has very little party feel\nto it. It\u2019s all about boys. Don't women have anything else to sing about\nother than boys?\nWe have the very crunk track Do\nIt To It, which basically tells you\nto get into the ATL style of dancing and which sounds like a female\nand less aggressive version of Lil\u2019\nJon\u2019s Do it To It track. The next\ntrack Chevy throws about slangs\nnon-Atlanta residents would not\nunderstand. Unappreciated is self-explanatory and Moment in Time,\nthe sister do show us a bit of their\nvocal ability. My favourites are Stop\nCalling \u2013 not because I would love\nto play this track to all bugaboos but\nit actually shows that the girls take\ntime to sing about the odd things\nwomen experience \u2013 and OOOH because it raises a lot of issues young\nteenagers and women go through\nin today\u2019s society.\nThis does sound like a standard\ngirl-group album; trying hard to\ncover all the basics about relationships and recording it, or four girls\nwho have always dreamt of being\nstars. At the end of the day this album is not great but one would definitely find something to relate to.\nFolake Adegbohun\nHailing from Minnesota, USA,\nTapes\u2019n\u2019Tapes offer up a quirky\nslice of indie-pop for our listening\npleasures in the form of this, their\ndebut album. The music itself is\nsimple enough, just guitars, drums,\nbass and vocals. In fact the opener\nof the album is called Just Drums\nand is easily the best opening track\nto an album I\u2019ve heard in a while.\nIt kicks into life with an infectious\nbeat and a catchy riff, and when it\nbreaks down in the bridge to \u2013 you\nguessed it \u2013 just the drums, then\nbringing the rest of the band back\nin it shows the band at their very\nbest. It\u2019s so intense and brilliant\nwhen it all comes together that I\nusually can\u2019t help but rewind it and\nlisten to it again.\nThe album never quite manages\nto reach this high again, and indeed\nsome of the album is quite boring\nand a couple of songs miss the mark\nand just get annoying after a few\nlistens. This hit-and-miss approach\ndoes pay off in places though, because the hits are just that. Tracks\nlike Cowbell and lead single Insistor really grab your attention with\ntheir foot-tapping beats and curiously hum-able melodies.\nThisisn\u2019ttosaythatTapes\u2019n\u2019Tapes\nare a one-trick pony though, and\nthey demonstrate their versatility\nwith some slower, delicate, (whis-per it) ballads. Songs like Omaha\nand 10 Gallon Ascots are slow-burning anthems which provide\nbeautiful counterpoints to the fast-paced singles and give the album a\ngood balance.\nNot all of the album works, and\nsongs like The Iliad seem more\nlike b-sides than the more album-worthy material. The singer\u2019s voice\ncan also be grating at times, and his\nhigh-pitched, almost whiny style\ncould put some people of the band\naltogether.\nOverall this album probably won\u2019t\nchange your life, and it isn\u2019t really\nanything incredibly original either,\nbut it is a very well crafted set of\nsongs which are fun to both listen\nand dance to as well. Hopefully the\nband can take the best from what\nwe have seen on offer here, leaving\nbehind the rest, and create a superior second album which would\nsurely be a classic in the waiting.\nUntil then though \u2013 get this, enjoy\nmost of it and just forget about the\nrest.\nToby Prudden\nThis being the Kerrang darlings\u2019\nsophomore album, a term that resonates pretty well with a band that\nwas once described as playing like\na bunch of fifteen year-olds. I doubt\ntheir fans could tell the difference\nthough, since most of them are fifteen (chronologically or otherwise).\nDespite this, you can\u2019t accuse them\nof having no ambition; and perhaps\na little too much at that! Now then,\nthis album certainly isn\u2019t the first in\nthat general shift by mainstream\nmetal from the hugely irritating\nscreamo craze back towards retro-tastic hair metal, even if this album\nis admittedly most evocative of the\nthrash classics by the likes of Metallica and Megadeth. The band can\neven turn out copycat Kerry King\nsolos and work in some interesting time signatures at times. It just\nmakes you wonder what they could\nhave achieved without such an annoying front-man!\nUnashamedly my main problem\nhere is with Matt Heafy. Now he\nmay have been helped into the saddle by the fact that his dad runs a\nrecord company, and I don\u2019t really\nhold a grudge against him for that.\nI don\u2019t even get that irate at the fact\nhe plays the late \u2018Dimebag\u2019 Darrell\u2019s old guitar. But I can\u2019t forgive\nhim for consistently falling into awful cheese-laden ballads in virtually\nevery song, or for that matter, the\nentire length of This World Can\u2019t\nTear Us Apart. BLEURGH!\nHere is where it goes horribly, horribly wrong: For tonight Matthew,\nHeafy is going to be performing as\nJames Hetfield \u2013 a premise that is\nneither original nor anywhere near\nthe original; thus we end up with\nsome of the worst, wincing, tone-deaf drawling I have ever heard.\nThe lyrics on this record, now\n(unfortunately) clearly audible,\nclearly consist of the kind of hackneyed politically-correct moralising\nthat makes me want to reach for a\nbucket.\nBecause inevitably and here\u2019s the\ncrunch, Trivium suck \u2013 There\u2019s just\nno way round it. Trivium really do\ngive Mr. Dyson something to worry\nabout; no matter how hard they try\nnot to (and there\u2019s certainly been\na smidgen of effort here), and definitely no matter how technically\nthey can play, it still ends up as an\nultimately forgettable album.\nTo start with, Trivium need to\nlearn the definition of irony (noone\nreally knows the definition \u2013 Ed),\nas the name itself suggests either\nmuch sarcasm or an inferiority\ncomplex, something that this band\nseems to eke the complete opposite\nof. On the plus side at least, I give it\nto them for having the cheek to try\nand make another Master of Puppets, even if The Crusade is nothing\nmore than Garbage Inc.\nAlex McKitrick\nTrivium\nThe Crusade\n(Roadrunner)\n\u2605\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\nCherish\nUnappreciated\n(Parlophone)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nTapes\u2019n\u2019Tapes\nThe Loon\n(XL Records)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nR\n13\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\n\n"

    "content": "Artist, inventor, Renaissance man\nCan yet another da Vinci exhibition really bring us any closer to understanding the man behind the genius?\nLeonardo da Vinci: painter, sculp-tor, architect, engineer, inventor,\nand the iconic Renaissance man.\nA fascinating exhibition currently\nshowing at the Victoria & Albert\nMuseum, \u201cLeonardo da Vinci:\nExperience, Experiment and Design\u201d, explores the artistic roots of\nda Vinci\u2019s creativity. It also claims\nto explain how he managed to be\nso inventive. In short, it argues\nthat he used drawing as a form of\nbrainstorming.\nThe exhibition brings together\nmore than sixty of Leonardo\u2019s finest drawings, manuscripts, and\nnotebooks from a variety of collec-tions. These documents are ample\ntestament to the amazing breadth\nof his interests. At the same time,\nthey clearly illustrate the important\nlinks he made between diverse topics that once seemed unconnected.\nFor Leonardo, the world, and\neverything in it, was governed by\nlaws of nature. He believed that it\nwas possible to work out the causes\nof natural phenomena by observing them. Once understood, such\ncauses could be applied by analogy\nto other parts of creation. Nowhere\nwas this better demonstrated than\nin his studies of the human body.\nThe body was the world in micro-cosm: smaller in scale, yet equivalent in complexity, and operating\nunder the same natural laws. So,\nLeonardo was able to liken the\ntwisted channel of an aged blood\nvessel to the tortuous course of a\nsilted riverbed. He could even deduce the vortex flow of blood in the\nheart from observing the turbulent\nmotion of water.\nMany other aspects of the great\nman\u2019s work are represented in this\nexhibition, such as explorations of\nthree-dimensional geometry, nature in motion, military engineer-ing, architectural visions, and various devices of entertainment. As\nwell as seeing them in Leonardo\u2019s\nown hand, you can see them come\nto life as animated versions projected onto the walls, high above the\nexhibits themselves.\nUnfortunately, true 3D representations of Leonardo\u2019s ingenious\ndesigns are somewhat lacking. The\nreconstructions that have been\nmade available are few in number\nand are displayed unsympathetical-ly at some distance from the main\nexhibition. In contrast, a previous\nScience Museum exhibition called\nThe Art of Innovation successfully\nmade a feature of specially created\nmodels.\nAnything to do with da Vinci always attracts plenty of visitors. So,\nviewing all the exhibits in the relatively cramped display gallery was\na slow and frustrating experience.\nLuckily, I took advantage of the\nexcellent audio guide narrated by\nthe show\u2019s curator, Martin Kemp,\nLeonardo da Vinci: Experience,\nExperiment and Design\nVictoria and Albert Musuem\nUntil January 7th 2007\n\u00a35 Students\nHorses in action, studies of expression horses, lion and man, an architectural groundplan. c.1505\n16 felix Friday 3 November 2006\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nProfessor of the History of Art at\nOxford. This certainly enhanced\nmy appreciation and kept my impatience in check.\nIn the end, though, I felt that\n\u00a35 for entry plus \u00a33 for the audio\nguide was on the steep side for\nthis intriguing but limited exhibi-tion. If you are interested, I would\ncertainly encourage you to go, but\ndo spend some time to look around\nthe V&A\u2019s extensive galleries.

You\u2019d think that the NT would\nbe marking the occasion, that\nthere\u2019d be celebratory adaptations\nof his works on the BBC and that\neveryone would be dusting off their\ncopy of My Fair Lady.\nNo, the celebrations seem to be\nconfined to one theatre in Richmond, the Orange Tree. But don\u2019t\nlet that put you off; their new production of Shaw\u2019s Major Barbara is\na fittingly explosive tribute to this\nunderrated playwright.\nThe play revolves around the\nstruggle of morals between Andrew Undershaft (Robert Austin),\nan arms manufacturer, and his estranged daughter Barbara, a Salvation Army Major.\nTo save her father\u2019s soul, Barbara\npersuades him to visit her barracks,\nbut in return she agrees to visit his\narms factory and listen to his side.\nThroughout the first two acts, Octavia Walter\u2019s Barbara is deliciously evangelical, preserving her ho-lier-than-though expressions with\nannoying precision. But when her\nfather\u2019s money becomes the only\nway of saving the barracks, Barbara\u2019s moral high-ground starts to\nlook uneven.\nOnly her images of a hellish factory can keep her idealism alive,\nbut she soon discovers how well her\nfather\u2019s workers live.\nUndershaft\u2019skeyspeech,pleading\nthat poverty is the greatest crime, is\nimmensely persuasive, and Austin\u2019s\nperformance is amplified by the intense atmosphere of the theatre in\nthe round. But Barbara\u2019s ultimate\ndecision would shake any idealist to\nthe core, exposing the uncomfortable humanity inside us all. I defy\nyou to sit through this play and not\nquestion your own morality.\nEmily Lines\nROBERT DAY\n\n"

Chanel challenged\nthe traditional fashions of the day,\nrejecting the restrictive impractical\nstylesforpracticalbutelegantcloth-ing. Her innovations became basics\nin the wardrobes of generations of\nwomen: jersey suits and dresses,\nthe chemise, pleated skirts, the\ncardigan suit, the blazer, the little\nblack dress, the sling pump, strapless dresses, the trench coat. Much\nlike Comme De Garcons is to Rei\nKawakubo, Chanel was an expression of Coco\u2019s personal style; a mix\nof the vocabulary of both male and\nfemale clothes.\nCoco was associated with the\nmost creative artists of the day:\nDiaghilev, Picasso, Stravinsky and\nCocteau. She liked to express herself through the fashion she created\nand once said, \u201cFashion is not something that exists in dresses only.\nFashion is in the sky, in the street,\nfashion has to do with ideas, the\nway we live, what is happening.\u201d\nOf other designers, Chanel said,\n\u201cFashion has become a joke. The\ndesigners have forgotten that there\nare women inside the dresses.\u201d\nChanel believed that women should\ndress simply and comfortable, she\nmade only clothes that she herself\nwould wear. In a way Chanel was\na feminist in the clothes she de-signed, built to work with women\nrather than restrict them.\nThe name Coco was adopted by\nChanel when, after a brief stint as\na seamstress, she started working\nas a cabaret singer at La Rotonde.\nAt the Caf\u00e9 La Rotonde she met\nEtienne Balsan, a millionaire cavalry officer and textile heir, who financed her move to Paris. Through\nBalsan, Coco was introduced to\nhigh society where she acquired\nthe habits and tastes of the wealthy.\nShe became a hat designer in 1908,\nproviding an alternative to the ostrich boa hats women in high society wore, which she herself found\ndistasteful. Using the resources\nof Balsan and another patron, she\nopened her first millinery shop in\nDeuville 1912. Through her contacts with high society, her shop\nsoon became a success.\nFrom hats, Chanel added clothes\nto the collection, with her romantic\naffairs with the artist Paul Iribe,\nthe Duke of Westminster, Grand\nDuke Dmitri of Russia, and British\nsportsman Arthur Capel having a\nconsiderable influence on her often\nmale-inspired fashions. Capel\u2019s lavish gifts of jewels served as the keystones of Coco's astonishing collection of costume jewellery. Costume\njewellery had previously been un-fashionable, but Coco popularised\nit, using fake jewels in lavish ropes\nof imitation pearls to enhance her\nsimple understated clothes. It was\nalso Capel\u2019s blazer, lent to Coco on\na chilly day at the polo grounds, that\ninspired her famous box jacket.\nChanel was arguably the most\ninnovative designer of her time.\nShe was first designer to use wool\njersey in women\u2019s wear, using it to\nmake soft clingy dresses. Wool jersey had previously been used solely\nfor men\u2019s underwear. Her original\nuse of jersey fabric attracted the attention of influential wealthy wom-en, because it freed them from the\nprevalent corseted style of dresses.\nHer nonconformist designs revolutionized the textile industry. Her\ndesigns were also credited with the\ndevelopment of American mass\nproduction. Her designs were simple and used standard fabrics, making them easy to copy. Thousands\nof knock-offs of her designs were\nmade, sometimes costing more\nthan an original Chanel.\nIn contrast with most designers\nChanel was not perturbed by this,\nsaying, \u201cI want my dresses to go\nout on the street.\u201d Coco, controver-sially, popularised women's trousers with her design of bell-bottom\ntrousers, which she had designed to\nenable her to climb more easily in\nand out of gondolas in Venice. She\nalso, if accidentally, kicked off the\nfeminist trend of bobbed hair when\nafter singeing her hair she decided\nto cut it all off. Tanning was another\naccidental trend started by Chanel,\nafter she accidentally became sunburned during a cruise to Cannes.\nChanel loved to quote the poet\nPaul Valery, saying, \u201ca badly perfumed woman has no future.\u201d In\n1922 Chanel introduced the fragrance that insured her fame,\nChanel No. 5, named after Coco\u2019s\nlucky number. The first to be sold\nworldwide, it stood out with its Art\nDeco bottle and minimalist pack-aging. It contrasted with the other\nflamboyant perfume bottles of the\ntime, in the same way that her relaxed fashions were in sharp contrast to the corset fashions popular\nin the previous decades. Chanel\nNo. 5 remains an indelible symbol\nof Chanel and is still popular today.\nAs Chanel's Senior VP of Marketing\nand Sales Jean Zimmerman says,\n\u201cThe success of No5 is due to the\nfragrance itself and the very creative advertising behind it.\"\nIn 1923 Chanel launched the signature Chanel suit; a knee-length\nskirt and trim, boxy jacket, traditionally made of woven wool with\nblack trim and gold buttons and\nworn with large costume-pearl\nnecklaces. Chanel retired in 1938\nbut returned in 1954 to introduce a\nnew suit design; a collarless, braid-trimmed cardigan jacket with a\ngraceful skirt. At first this was not\nvery popular with Europeans, especially the press, perhaps as a result\nof the tarnishing of her reputation\nduring the war. During her retirement she had an affair with a Nazi\nofficer, diminishing her popularity.\nShe moved to Switzerland, returning to reopen her Paris shop only to\nboost lagging perfume sales. However unpopular at first in Europe,\nher new suit was a massive success\nin America, and worn by the likes of\nJackie Kennedy. By the 1960s much\nof what Coco was doing was refining\nthe classic Chanel look. However,\ndespite now being part of the fashion establishment she once hated,\nshe still liked to rebel against established trends, creating boyish flapper creations to contrast with the\nBelle \u00c9poque millinery fashionable\nat that time. She also worked for\nvarious Hollywood studios, dressing the likes of Audrey Hepburn,\nLiz Taylor and Anne Baxter.\nBy the time of Chanel\u2019s death, her\nfashion empire made over $160m a\nyear and counted among its clients\nPrincess Grace, Queen Fabiola,\nMarlene Dietrich and Ingrid Bergman. As a Time article published\non January 25th, 1972, a week after\nher death said: \"Just her name was\nenough to define a pair of shoes, a\nhat, a pocketbook, a suit, perfume,\njewellery\u2014an entire look. It conveyed prestige, quality, impeccable taste and unmistakable style.\nBy her death last week at 87, the\nFrench couturi\u00e8re had long since\nestablished herself as the 20th cen-tury's single most important arbiter\nof fashion.\"\n\"Fashion has\nbecome a joke.\nThe designers\nhave forgotten\nthat there are\nwomen inside\nthe dresses.\"\n\u2013 Coco Chanel\nThe iconic Coco Chanel\n\n"

Given the option,\nit\u2019s obvious which someone would\nchoose.\nThese amazing visuals come at\na high price, however. Back in the\nworld of Pong and Pacman, development times were measured in\nweeks or months. Today, they are\nmeasured in years. The time, effort,\nand money needed to create the\ngraphics players have come to expect from modern games are vast.\nBut in terms of the \u201cfun\u201d they add to\na game \u2026 is it all really worth it?\nThe human mind is very good\nat ignoring unnecessary details.\nAmazing visual effects do a good job\nof creating that \u201cwow\u201d factor when\na gamer looks at the back of the box\nin their high-street shop.

Just like a movie with great\neffects is poor if it\u2019s backed up by a\nweak plot, a game with weak gameplay won\u2019t hold the attention of the\nA gamer\u2019s favourite bedroom pastime\nNeverwinter Nights veteran Bryn Davies talks about mods, modules and fame\nWhen Neverwinter Nights was released back in 2002, it had a profound impact both on the average\nmultiplayer gamer, as well as the\naspiring coder. The Aurora toolset\nenabled both teams and individuals\nto create their own worlds, sharing work between a strong online\ncommunity.\nWith the release of Neverwinter\nNights 2 this week, it\u2019s possible that\nthere\u2019s another revolution on the\nhorizon. Felix Games talks to Bryn\nDavies, the creator of the module\nTrue Colors of a Hero, about how\nthe tools and the people have enabled him to create a world.\nIs TCOAH the first modification\nyou\u2019ve ever made for a game?\nFar from it, though its definitely the\nlargest project I\u2019ve ever undertak-en. I started modding back when the\nQuake II editor was released. From\nthere I moved on to Unreal, then\nthrough the series all the way up to\nUnreal Tournament 2004. Mainly I\njust coded weapons, skinned characters and designed levels. I\u2019m\nno 3d artist (I could never make\nanything that didn\u2019t just look like a Bryn Davies\u2019 customisations to NWN include an emote system\nplayer, no matter how many pretty\nexplosions it has.\nFor today\u2019s smaller developers,\nthe situation can look pretty bleak.\nWithout the vast resources available to the big studios, they will often\nfall flat on their face while trying to\nmatch the visual quality of the latest\nblockbuster. The big development\ncompanies would have you believe\nit\u2019s impossible to make a hit game\nwithout a team of hundreds and\nmillions of pounds at your disposal\n\u2026 and they may well be correct.\nDoes this mean there isn\u2019t a place\nfor the small independent developer in a market full of movie licenses\nand 2006/7/8 sports managers? Not\nnecessarily. Things are starting to\nchange in how games reach their\naudience. Traditionally, a developer\nwould produce a game, and then\nstart it down the long and treacherous journey of publishers, distribu-tors, and resellers. If all goes well,\nthe game will end up on a shelf in\na high street shop, where it\u2019s critically compared by unforgiving customers against the rest of the market based on how much \u201cwow\u201d they\ncan squeeze on the back of a 7\u201d by\n10\u201d box \u2013 a pretty harsh environment for a small and unestablished\ndeveloper.\nBut with the advent of online\ndistribution, games can be delivered directly to customers who are\nable to make much more informed\nchoices. This new market pits small\ndevelopers with new ideas on a lev-Unreal Tournament 07\u2019s weapons boast more pixels than entire levels did in the original.

There will always be\nmoney to be made in pumping out\nsequel upon sequel of a tried and\ntesting concept by companies who\nreally can\u2019t afford to take risks. This\ncould leave the market\u2019s need for\ninnovative and original games to\nbe met by the smaller companies\nwho perhaps don\u2019t have as much to\nlose.\nFor now at least there is a glimmer of hope for the gamers who\u2019ve\nbecome disillusioned by the unanswered call for new and unique\ngames - small developers with big\nideas have just found a new voice.\nbundle of cubes) so modelling was\nout of the question.

Most modules\nnow use such sophisticated scripting and custom content, but to be\nhonest it\u2019s not strictly needed.\nIf you\u2019re already able to create a\nworking adventure, with unlimited\nscope for its length and the many\npathways to its end without even\ntouching a single string of code,\nthen all you\u2019re left with is the level\ndesign and the story (from which\nyour gameplay should follow).\nThe community is fantastic. 4\nyears after its initial release you\u2019re\nstill getting people releasing free\ncontent for it.

    "content": "Students\u2019 uncapped top-up anger\n7,500 students marched through\nLondon on Sunday to protest\nagainst top up fees. The march began in Bloomsbury, passed Downing Street and ended up in Trafalgar Square where 3,000 balloons\nwere released, one for every pound\neach new student owes to the government under the new Top-Up\nfees scheme.\nThe protest was aimed at forcing the government to drop plans\nto remove the \u00a33,000 cap on top\nup fees. Many students want the\nentire scheme scrapped, although\nthe government pushed the Higher\nEducation Act through parliament,\nwhich set up the current scheme,\nin 2004. There were fierce protests\nat the time, and now plans to lift\nthe cap on fees have rekindled the\ntouch paper.\nTop up fees are an attempt to reform the way undergraduate students pay for university courses.\nUntil 1997 students would pay nothing for their university education.\nAfter 1997 students had to pay\nup to \u00a31,250 per year for their de-grees, the exact amount was set\nby \u2018means-testing\u2019 which looks at\nthe income of a student\u2019s parents.\nStudents could then apply for a\nmeans-tested student loan from\nthe Student Loans Company, a government owned organisation. The\nloans were charged such that interest is in line with inflation. In \u2018real\u2019\nterms this meant the loans were\ninterest free. After graduation the\nstudent pays back the loan at a rate\nof 9% gross income on all earnings\nabove \u00a315,000. The introduction of\nthese fees was controversial, seeing\nthe average student debt rise from\n\u00a32,212 in 1992 to \u00a313,501 in 2005.\nUnder the new scheme, which\ncame into effect this year, universities can charge up to \u00a33,000 per\nyear for undergraduate studies,\nprovided they meet certain equality standards as far as induction\nis concerned. The Student Loans\nCompany pays the fees instead of\nthe student and the loans system\nremains unchanged. The student\nloans and the university fees are\nthen paid back to the Student Loans\nCompany after graduation under\nthe same terms as before.\nThe changes mean that the average student debt is predicted to\nreach \u00a320,000 for students enrolling\nin 2006.\nThe scheme that applies to this\nyears freshers is only the beginning\nof the government\u2019s plan though.\nThere are suggestions for the\n\u00a33,000 cap on top up fees that currently applies to be lifted; this has\nsparked the recent protest. If the\n\u00a33,000 cap is lifted then students\ncould be exposed to even more financial pressure. Predictions show\nthat average graduate debt could\nrise to \u00a344,000 by 2023.\nThe main concern is that students from low to middle income\nbackgrounds will be deterred from\nfurther study by the burden of debt.\nGemma Tumelty, the NUS presi-dent, said: \u201cWe really believe that\ndebt will be a huge deterrent on\nstudents entering education.\n\u201cThis year there were 15,000 fewer\nstudents - that\u2019s a huge concern to\nus, particularly when Government\nis trying to widen participation.\u201d\nAlthough new students will not\nhave to pay their fees until they\nstart working, Ms Tumelty said the\nprospect of debt after graduation\nwas \u201cstill there like a mill-stone\nround someone\u2019s neck\u201d.\nJust 10 Imperial students as opposed to 40 LSE students attended\nthe protest. The low turn out certainly does not reflect the Union\u2019s\nposition with Union President, John\nCollins throwing his support behind\nthe march. John Collins also noted\nin an article for Live!: \u201cAround a\ndozen students from Imperial were\nspotted on the march which compares favourably to larger London\nUnions such as UCL, which has a\nsmaller turnout.\u201d\nThe union didn\u2019t receive help from\nULU due to illness, and heard the\ndetails of the protest late because\nImperial is not a member of NUS.\nBut these factors did not stop a concerted publicity drive by the union\nwhich included a poster campaign,\npublicity at the JCR and the front\npage of the union website being\ngiven over to the protest. The main\nreason for a low turn out appeared\nto be a sense of apathy amongst Imperial students.\nBen Harris, Deputy President for\nEducation and Welfare, said that\nthe main reason people were not interested was because the cap would\nnot be removed whilst they were at\nuniversity. The drawn out approach\nthe government has adopted on the\nintroduction of top up fees seems\nto have taken the edge off the campaign as far as Imperial students\nare concerned.\nCompared to last year\u2019s larger\nmarch, there were 20 fewer Imperial students attending this time\nround. This low turn out amount\nwould appear to be part of a national trend.\nSpeaking to Felix, Ben Harris\nsaid: \u201cI believe the low turnout\nfrom Imperial mirrors a national\ntrend. This is partly due to the fact\nthat any attempt to lift the cap, although a very real danger, is still\nthree years away.\u201d\nThe impetus for reform came\nfrom the universities themselves.\nThe Russell Group, the British\nequivalent of the Ivy League, has\nbeen particularly supportive of the\nnew measures.\nIn the US the undergraduates pay\nlarge amounts to study. The university loans the student the fees until\nafter graduation. An undergraduate course at Harvard, for example,\ncost $39,880 for the 2004/5 academic\nyear, that\u2019s approximately \u00a321,000.\nThe price contains board and lodg-ing, tuition fees and health care\ncover. Students can claim $28,500\nin aid from the university. The rest\nmust be paid up front. By contrast,\nan Imperial student living in Beit\nhall in the same academic year\nwould have expected to pay around\n\u00a36,000 for a similar service.\nWith the stark difference in the\namount students pay gives the US\nuniversities access to far greater\nresources than the British ones.\nThe Russell Group, and other universities claim that this causes US\ninstitutions to be far more competitive in attracting research grants,\nthe main source of income for uni-versities. There is then a snowballing effect as top academic talents\nchose to work in the US, attracting\nmore research grants. The British universities are together in the\nview that something must be done.\nThe solution proffered by the\ngovernment is the so called top up\nfee. But the scheme is a contradiction to a fundamental principle that\nBritain aspires to. Namely, that no\ncitizen should be held back from\nsuccess for lack of opportunity. We\nhave the NHS; every citizen is entitled to healthcare, state educa-tion; every citizen is entitled to an\neducation. Top up fees are seen by\nmany as depriving those from less\naffluent backgrounds from the opportunity of higher education. The\neffect is to drive a wedge into soci-ety, widening the rich poor divide.\nLast week Felix reported on the\ncase of Geraint Banks-Wilkinson,\na student who took his own life because he was unable to cope with\nthe financial pressure of studying\nat university.\nThe message is getting through\nto school pupils. \u2018Sexy Maths\u2019 was\nan outreach program at Imperial\nCollege last year. Students went to\nlocal schools and give a presentation aimed at advertising the advantages of studying at university\nand, in particular, the advantages of\nstudying Mathematics at university.\nThe program was very successful,\nleading to the more appropriately\ntitled \u2018Maths Matters\u2019 program, although one of the main questions\nschool pupils asked at the events\nwas: \u201cWhy should I study at univer-sity, don\u2019t you end up with a lot of\ndebt?\u201d\nThis is precisely the question the\ngovernment doesn\u2019t want school\npupils asking, they claim to be dedicated to increasing the number of\ngraduates. With this in mind, they\ncurrently offer a system of grants\nfor disadvantaged students that\ncan total \u00a33,000 per year. They don\u2019t,\nhowever, tackle the problem of students being disaffected with the\nburden of debt resulting in the 3.7%\nfall in the number of student appli-cants, that\u2019s equivalent to the entire\npopulation of Coventry University.\nStudents march to Trafalgar Square in national protest over government plans to lift the cap on top-up fees\nDavid Ellis\nNews Editor\nStudents gathered to hear speeches from prominent campaigners in Trafalgar Square last Sunday\n\u2022 Families earning less than \u00a317,501 can apply for grant of \u00a32,700 a\nyear, which reduces to nothing for families on \u00a337,425\n\u2022 Universities charging maximum fees will have to fund bursaries of\nat least \u00a3300 for the poorest students\n\u2022 Students can still pay up-front if they want to\n\u2022 Unpaid fees are repayable by graduates once their annual income\npasses \u00a315,000\n\u2022 Payments must be at least 9% of gross income above \u00a315,000\nTop-Up Fees Information\n3000 balloons released in Trafalgar Square, one for every pound new students owe to the government for\neach year of their degree\n3\nfelix\nFriday 3 November 2006\nNEWS news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Its most\nredeeming feature in any rock\nclimber\u2019s eyes is the huge variety\nand quantity of climbing it offers,\nall within low-cost airline fares. It\nwas for this reason, despite some\npeople\u2019s misgivings, that I bought\na plane ticket to Marseille and set\noff with the Mountaineering Club\nto the Verdon Gorge for this year\u2019s\nsummer tour.\nThe Verdon is a river running\nthrough the Alpes-des-Haute-Provence in South-Eastern France. It\nhas cut over thousands of years a\nthree hundred metre deep gorge,\ncreating seemingly endless limestone walls that provide some of\nthe world\u2019s most spectacular multi-pitch sport climbing. To explain the\njargon, \u2018sport\u2019 is a type of climbing where you clip into small bolts\nas you ascend which are already\ndrilled and cemented into the rock.\nThis allows safe, rapid climbs and\nis used widely in Europe, but is rare\nin the UK where a traditional ethos\ndictates that all protection should\nbe carried with you. This is in the\nform of various shaped bits of metal\ncalled \u2018gear\u2019 which can be jammed\ninto cracks on the way up and removed afterwards so as not to damage the rock. Multi-pitch refers to\nthe length of the climb. When the\nroute is longer than your rope, you\nstop, anchor yourself to a ledge and\nbring up your climbing partner before setting off again.\nWe arrived eager to test our mul-ti-pitch skills (and nerves) only to\ndiscover the necessary guidebook\nwas out of print! Luckily for us the\nowner of the local climbing shop,\nSabine, was able to step in and act\nas a human route guide. As far as\nwe could tell she has climbed pretty\nmuch every route in the area, knew\neverywhere off by heart, often even\nbetter than the book itself. Needless\nto say, due to the personalised route\ndescriptions, presents and bags of\nsweets she gave us, more than one\nof us fell for the eccentric old lady in\nthe climbing shop.\nSomething even Sabine could not\nreassure us of was how to escape\nthe gorge in the event of things\nnot going to plan. The river valley\nis only accessible at ground level\nfrom the lake, about a ten mile hike\nand swim from the climbs them-selves! The only easy way to the\nbottom of the climbs was from the\ntop of the gorge. To reach them you\nhave to abseil down, taking your\nrope \u2013 the only escape \u2013 with you. If\nyou can\u2019t climb out, it is a very long\nwalk along and up the gorge to safe-ty. Add to this the risk of the dam\nsluice gates being opened without\nwarning, made the bottom of the\ngorge a fairly inhospitable place!\nCurious to discover this for our-selves, we rented canoes and set off\nup the river. A few miles upstream\nthe narrowing of the channel resulted in tempting white water. Obviously we had to test our rafting\nskills, but predictably these weren\u2019t\nquite up to scratch and the canoe\nwas upside down, with Henry\u2019s shirt\nfloating fast downstream (or so he\nsays). Nevertheless, in his topless,\nsoaked state he managed to hitchhike back home (being picked up\nin record time). As a female friend\nrecently informed me \u201cwet muscles\nare irresistible\u201d.\nThis trip was certainly one to re-member, but Verdon has not been\nour only excursion of the year; club\nmembers have climbed in Yosemite,\nthe Alps, Italy, Lofoten, Sardinia,\nFontainebleau, Utah, Kazahkstan,\nFrankenjura, Croatia, and the Red\nRocks. Even in England the sun is\nknown to shine occasionally, and\nthroughout the year we have fortnightly trips to locations all over the\nUK. These are not only a chance\nto practice climbing skills, but an\nexcuse to escape London for the\nweekend. We have just returned\nfrom this year\u2019s fantastic Freshers\u2019\nTrip to the Peak District, for which\nwe took over thirty members!\nAbove all, our club is about encouraging newcomers and teaching\nthem to climb. For a taster, meet us\nin the union quad at 1pm on any\nWednesday and we will take you\nto the Westway Centre, one of the\nUK\u2019s largest indoor climbing walls.\nThere we will teach you the basics\nof climbing and rope work before\nyou join us on one of our outdoor\ntrips, where you will inevitably get\nhooked on climbing for life.\nFor more information, email\nmatthew.wallace@imperial.\nac.uk, or check out our website at: www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/rcc/mountaineering/\nIn my first year, I was amazed\nthat university venues like King\u2019s\nCollege were putting on brilliant\ngigs such as the first UK show\nwith The Arcade Fire performing.\nWhat amazed me was that our\nunion barely had any live music\nin comparison. There was little\nvariety for someone like me who\nlikes music that is a bit different.\nPeople who shared my opinion\ndidn\u2019t feel proud of their union, or\nmaybe not pride but people were\npassionless. When people aren\u2019t\npassionate about something, a\nsense of community is not there\nsince there is no purpose for one\nto exist.\nTaking into account both of\nthese things, I took over the esteemed position of President of\nthe Alternative Music Society\nlast academic year (I took over\nfrom the god amongst men that\nis James Millen). One of my aims\nwas to create a community at Imperial of people who appreciated\nmusic and I needed a focal point\nfor this. Thus, I created Kids Will\nBe Skeletons, our regular gig\nnight where we charge the minimum entry possible. I started off\nwith little experience of promoting and took quite an amateur\napproach. Our first night was\nchaotic but inevitably fun. It was\nbrilliant that people were actually\nbeing bothered about the union\nand actually wanted to go there\nto see some underground music.\nImperial is notorious for its\napathy and naturally some nights\nnot many people have turned up.\nThis can be disheartening but we\ngo on nevertheless because we\nwant to constantly provide a live\nmusic outlet at Imperial. Our 21st\nOctober night with a band from\nSan Francisco, Citizens Here and\nAbroad was our most popular\nnight ever.\nIt was great and we hope to continue our success with our next\nnight on November 5th in dBs at\n7:30pm. We have two bands from\nFrance called Gatechien and Le\nSinge Blanc and a band from\nLondon called Man Aubergine.\nWe are charging \u00a33 for students,\nnot to make money but so that\nwe can pay the bands\u2019 transport\nfrom France.\nWe don\u2019t stand to make money\nbut because our society does not\nhave that much money so we\nhave to charge entry. We will be\nrunning free nights when we can.\nPlease come down for a drink and\nsome great music so we can create a great atmosphere.\nLive music in dB\u2019s\nMatthew Wallace\nMatty Hoban\n\n"

    "content": "A waste of time, effort, and money\nI\nthoroughly believe that Imperial should vote in the upcoming referendum to stay\nout of the NUS. Why? I write\nas someone who has experience of NUS from being President\nof Durham Students\u2019 Union (DSU).\nI have only just started at Imperial,\nbut I can speak as someone who\nwas very heavily involved in DSU\nand had precious few good experiences with the National Union.\nThere are three core problems\nwith the NUS. It doesn\u2019t know what\nit\u2019s for, it has no forum to decide\nwhat it should do, and it is incapable\nof acting when it makes policy deci-sions. Beyond this, there is a fourth\nissue that is not so much about the\ntheoretical institution, but the people who are involved: it is highly\nself-serving, and frequently more\nconcerned with its own internal\npolitics than issues facing students\nacross the UK.\nI went to three NUS National\nconferences \u2013 2003, 2004, and 2005\n\u2013 such are the pleasures of student union presidency. There will\nbe those who will say that Imperial\nneeds a national voice and NUS is\nwhere it can achieve it. One visit to\nNUS National Conference (NC) illustrates how false this is.\nMy first visit to NUS NC was comparatively better than everyone had\ntold me it would be \u2013 sure you had\nrigged elections, voting cards that\nyou could buy from political factions\nTheir ideals may seem attractive on the surface, but if you have ever been unfortunate enough to be closely\ninvolved with the NUS you will know the reality is a whole world away from what they lead us to believe\nin return for your support, people\non the balcony instructing their faction how to vote, stage occupations,\nendless procedural motions, votes\ntaking longer than an hour, dismal\nattendance by the NEC (National\nExecutive Committee \u2013 NUS\u2019s top\nofficers), but in comparison to what\nI was promised this seemed like\nabove par for the course.\nGo three times and you realise\nhow entrenched these failings are.\nPolitical factions dominate NUS.\nPeople grouping together because\nof a shared goal of opinions is no\nbad thing, but at NC all that matters to swathes of the delegates is\nwhich faction wins each issue, not\nthe issue/election itself.\nBecause of the power of the fac-tions, and the amount of noise a\nsmall group of students can make,\nNUS is impotent to represent the\n\u201caverage\u201d (I don\u2019t use this term\npejoratively) student. Near riots,\nscreams of \u201cIntimidation!\u201d, and\nfarcical votes of no confidence will\nbe brought up at the first mention\nof the Israel/Palestine occupation,\nbut barely anyone will listen during\na student housing debate, and the\nresolution eventually passed will\nbe so very mundane and anodyne\nyou\u2019ll wonder why you even bothered to vote.\nThis polarisation extends to the\nNUS\u2019s campaigns. The only higher-education funding line the NUS will\neven listen to is the total abolition\nE\nvery warden at Imperial\nhas an added remit related to the role of liaison.\nFor example, one warden\nis the liaison for issues\nregarding the Health Centre, another with Registry for disciplinary hearings etc.\nI am the Neighbours liaison. I\u2019m\nnot entirely sure how this was actually assigned. It could be because\nI am \u2018battle-hardened\u2019 \u2013 having\ndealt diplomatically with a hurl of\nabuse from one particular neighbour on more than one occasion\nbefore such roles were officially\nassigned.\nOr, hailing from Australia, someone thought it amusing to assign\nme the role of liaison with the\nnamesake of that atrocious Aussie\nsoap opera!\nBeing in my penultimate year as\nwarden of Fisher Hall in Evelyn\nGardens (appointments are made\nfor a fixed period) I have amassed\na comprehensive list of all the creative ways in which students manage to get themselves into trouble.\nFor the most part, getting up to\nsome mischief is all good fun but\nthe funny side is not always appreciated by private residents\nwho live in the neighbourhood or\nindeed by the wardening team\nwho often have to deal with the\nconsequences.\nAnd a particular neighbourhood\nit is indeed, where the cost of an\naverage two-bedroom flat is comparable to the GDP of a small\ncountry and the standard vehicle\nof choice is either a Porsche, Maserati, or a Chelsea tractor.\nA few years ago I had to discipline one of my student residents\nto make him understand that it\nwas not acceptable behaviour to\nurinate on one of these posses-sions, parked outside Fisher, while\nhis mate took photos.\nNeither was it acceptable for one\nstudent to be lowered, on a rope,\nby a friend, from a 3rd-storey window to a 2nd-storey one, to be let\nback into his room.\nNoise is a particular problem.\nIt only takes a few individuals in\na high density accommodation\nenvironment to generate a level\nof noise which can quickly annoy\nneighbours.\nNoise curfews are in place at all\nhalls of residents at Evelyn Gardens but these rules are, regret-tably, sometimes flouted. So, on a\nnumber of occasions my warden-ing team has had to diplomatically\nhandle calls from very irate neigh-bours: \u201c\u2026 yes sir \u2026 of course sir\n... we will look into it straight away\n\u2026 yes \u2026 no sir, they\u2019re not all ani-Everybody needs a good neighbours\u2019 liaison officer\nof fees. This is an attractive argu-ment, but go and speak to MPs and\nit ruins any chance of a debate \u2013 it\nmade discussion almost impossible when at the Higher Education\nAct 2004 votes Durham was trying\nto argue that top-up fees weren\u2019t\nthe way to fund education and we\nshould look at other options, but all\nthe NUS hacks could argue was the\nsame inflexible line \u2013 it must be totally free with no payment.\nIn the three years I was involved\nthe NEC were a supercilious, self-interested group. They would turn\nup at Durham once in a blue moon,\nalthough you will no doubt get the\nchance to meet many of them in\nthe next few weeks \u2013 if there\u2019s one\nthing you can be sure they\u2019ll turn\nup for it\u2019s a disaffiliation/affiliation\nreferendum. After this initial flurry,\nImperial would see very little input\nfrom the NEC, yet we\u2019d be paying\nthem tens of thousands of pounds\na year.\nIn fact finances have been a major\nproblem in NUS with many (most?)\naffiliated institutions underpaying,\nleaving NUS with a massive deficit\n(the truly incompetent spending of\nmoney by the NEC also does little\nto ameliorate this issue). Even the\nNUS Treasurer 2004/05 (Martin\nIngs, an uncharacteristically honest and hard working NEC mem-ber) would often look despairing as\nhe read out the latest batch of NUS\nexpenditure.\nTom Page\nBrian Falzon\nSurely, though, as I\u2019m sure the\npro-NUS camp will rightly say, Imperial needs national representa-tion: as the relationship with the\nUniversity of London draws to a\nclose, it\u2019s vital that we can speak up\nand be counted.\nI couldn\u2019t agree more, but NUS\nisn\u2019t capable of being that forum.\nWe should look at working with\ncomparable institutions \u2013 strong independent unions working togeth-er, co-ordinating campaigns and\nlobbying. We\u2019re ideally situated to\nmeet regularly with relevant MPs\n\u2013 at the mass lobbies of Parliament\nthat NUS organises the turnout\nis often embarrassing. We will be\nmore effective acting without the\ncumbersome monolith.\nThe pro-NUS camp will idealistically talk about the voice NUS will\noffer us, the solidarity we\u2019ll develop,\nthe resources for union officers and\nthe benefits for every student. We\nare only able, however, to join one\nversion of NUS \u2013 the real-world\nversion, and that couldn\u2019t be further from the ideals that it should\nespouse.\nNUS has much to gain from Imperial joining, yet we have little to\ntempt us bar the chance of 10% off\nat Topshop.\nLet\u2019s save our cash, our time, and\nthe trips to Blackpool, and instead\nplough that resource into working\nactively with other unions and improving services right here.\n\u201cI thoroughly\nbelieve that\nImperial should\nvote in the\nupcoming\nreferendum to\nstay out of NUS\u201d\nmals actually \u2026\u201d\nOver the years I have attended\nKensington and Chelsea Police\nCommunity Panel and Neighbourhood Watch meetings where I\nwas able to meet neighbours and\npolice officers and discuss issues\nwhich were of relevance to halls of\nresidence.\nMost neighbours are quite happy\nto have students around them but\nit is the intolerant few which we, as\nthe wardening team, need to pla-cate. This task is made easier when\nstudents respect the fact that living in an area which was recently\nreferred to as the most expensive\nreal estate in the world brings with\nit certain added responsibilities.\nConsidering the concentration\nof students that we have at Evelyn\nGardens, the number of incidents\nare comparatively low.\nThere are also certain advantag-es: local businesses love the extra\ncommerce that the students bring\nand some offer substantial dis-counts. The restaurant Tampopo,\nfor example, gives a 20% discount\nwith a student card. A number of\nother outlets regularly give us free\nitems to use as raffle prizes.\nThe fact that students don\u2019t bring\ncars down to London also means\nthat parking congestion is less\nthan it would be if Evelyn Gardens\nwas all residents.\nAnd I wonder how many burglars\nhave been scared off by the nocturnal habits of some of our students.\nGot anything\nyou would like\nto share with\nour readers?\nPlease send all\ncontributions to\ncomment.felix@\nimperial.ac.uk\n\u201cIt could be\nbecause I\nam \u2018battlehardened\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI have amassed\na comprehensive\nlist of all the\ncreative ways in\nwhich students\nmanage to get\nthemselves into\ntrouble\u201d\n8 felix Friday 3 November 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

Indeed,\nhis music career had inauspicious\nbeginnings with much-hated compulsory piano lessons from the age\nof five. His father, an accomplished\nukulele player, was undaunted by\nthis apparent lack of interest in\nall things musical. He introduced\nBrian to the ukulele the following\nyear and Brian quickly showed an\naptitude for the instrument. On his\nseventh birthday, after persistent\nnagging, Brian was given his first\nguitar. The seven-year-old Brian\nwas developing in other directions\ntoo; his love of astronomy and photography date to this time.\nAcademically gifted, Brian won a\nscholarship to Hampton Grammar\nSchool at the age of 11. He maintained his interest in music during\nColin Barras\nhis teenage years, famously working with his father, Harold, to build\nan electric guitar from the wood\nof a nineteenth century fireplace.\nThe unique sound of this guitar, the\n\u201cRed Special\u201d, was later to become\nas recognizable to legions of Queen\nfans as Freddie Mercury\u2019s vocals.\nBut, ever the realist, Brian still\nrecognized music as a mere hob-by. Encouraged by his parents, he\ncontinued his education at Imperial College in 1965, reading physics and infrared astronomy. During\nhis time at Imperial, he continued\nmaking music, initially through\na band formed during his school\ndays (called 1984) and later through\nthe short-lived group Smile. It was\nthrough Smile that Brian met future\nQueen drummer Roger Taylor.\nIn due course Brian graduated\nwith a BSc Honours degree in\nPhysics and Mathematics, and embarked on a PhD, also at Imperial.\nHe studied zodiacal light, the sunlight reflected off interplanetary\ndust particles. The research went\nwell, and Brian published in both\nBrian May\u2019s cosmic background\nNature and the Monthly Notices of\nthe Royal Astronomical Society. An\nacademic career seemed assured.\nBut then the financial reality of\nstudent life hit. Brian\u2019s doctoral\nresearch dragged on into a fourth\nyear, and the grant to support his\nliving expenses dried up. Brian\nresorted to teaching in a comprehensive school in Brixton to make\nends meet. Meanwhile, his evenings were devoted to music. By\nnow, Smile was no more; in 1970 the\nlead singer, Tim Staffell, had left\nthe band to pursue new musical horizons elsewhere. Tim\u2019s roommate,\nFreddie Bulsara (later Mercury)\npersuaded Brian and Roger to\ncontinue performing, and together\nformed Queen. In 1971 John Deacon joined the band on bass.\nShort of both the time and money\nnecessary to complete his PhD,\nBrian chose to discontinue his academic work. The decision proved to\nbe a wise one; Queen recorded their\neponymous first album in 1973 and\ndebuted in the UK singles charts\nwith Seven Seas of Rhye in 1974.\nGive me a title!(brian bio)\nThe band was incredibly prolific,\nreleasing a further fourteen studio albums and three greatest hits\npackages between 1974 and 1999.\nThis was a band of musical equals;\nall four band members contributed\nmemorable songs to the Queen\ncanon. Brian was responsible for\nrock anthems We Will Rock You and\nNow I\u2019m Here.\nFollowing the untimely death of\nFreddie in late 1991, Brian coped\nby throwing himself into his solo\nmusic career. The Brian May Band\nwas formed in 1992 and toured the\nworld and elsewhere on the back of\na successful album. Brian continued to explore new musical direc-tions; Queen had become the first\nrock band to become involved in\nfilm scoring, for Flash Gordon in\n1980 and Highlander in 1986. Brian\npenned the score for the French\nart film Furia in 1999. Elsewhere,\nhe was involved in the successful\ntranslation of Queen\u2019s music to the\nstage; The Queen musical We Will\nRock You is now well into its fifth\nsuccessful year at the Dominion\nTheatre on Tottenham Court Road.\nBrian continues to make the music headlines in the new millen-nium. One of the abiding images of\nthe 2002 celebration of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Golden Jubilee is Brian\u2019s rendition of God Save the Queen from\nthe roof of Buckingham Palace. In\n2005, Roger Taylor and Paul Rodgers, lead singer with 1970s band\nFree, joined Brian on the first tour\nby Queen in twenty years. Later in\nthe year, Brian received a CBE at\nBuckingham Palace.\nBut Brian has not forgotten his\nearly interest in astronomy and\nphotography. He has been a regular guest on The Sky at Night, the\nBBC\u2019s long-running television\nshow devoted to astronomy, and is\nreportedly working on a biography\nof nineteenth century photographer\nT R Williams. He was awarded the\nhonourary degree of Doctor of Science by the University of Hertfordshire in 2002. Recently, Brian has\ndecided he will finally return to his\nacademic studies to finish the PhD\nhe began in the late 1960s.\nColin Barras\nBrian May\u2019s (far left) writing partners for Bang!
