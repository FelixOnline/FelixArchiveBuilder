    "content": "The 9th Fontana Book of Great\nHorror Stories:\nEdited by Mary Danby.\nIAM not a devotee of, the Horror Story\ngenre myself prefer ing those distinct\nbrands of fiction lurking behind the l able S.F. However the anthology is common in\nall three forms of literature and in any\nanthology there is always at least one\nstory one likes. In this case it was 'The\nHorror at Chilton Castle', which despite its\nrather baroque title was very readable. I did not find the stories very frightening but\nthen again I was not reading them by\ncandlelight in an empty house at midnight.\nSome were so predictable they would need\nthat treatment. But I must not be too harsh\n\u2014 after eight volumes good stories must be\ngetting thin on the ground.\nA Glastonbury Romance\nJohn Cooper Powys\nTHIS IS a great book and has been compared with \"War and Peace' it qualifies by\nlength alone. The novel is ' a mystical\nmasterpiece ...that recreates the eternal\nlegend of the Grail'. However, despite\nthese defects, it remains an interesting\nbook. Perhaps the description 'erotic'\ncould also be used since the passions of a certain level of society in 1933 are examined concurrently with the passion of the\ngrail. The story is well constructed although a few of the mystic passages struck me as\nrather 'pseudo'.- The depth of characters\nare plumbed, predictability is avoided, and\nafter having adjusted to the style and pace\nof the book I found it quite enthralling.\nNevertheless, the mystic passages provided\nfor many breaks in the book and consequent\nlapses of concentration.\nIt would be appropriate to end with the\nfirst sentence of the book: 'At the striking\nof noon on a certain fifth of March, there\noccurred within a casual radius of Brandon\nrailway station and yet beyond the deepest\npools of emptiness between the uttermost\nstellar systems one of those infinitesimal\nripples in the creative silence of the First\nCause which always occur when an exceptional stir of heightened consciousness\nagitates any living organism in this astronomical universe'. Whew!\nJorge Luis Borges: A Universal\nHistory of Infamy\nThis is an amazing book. These short\nstories were originally written for public ation in an Argentinian Newspaper in the\n1930's and have only recently been translated from the original Spanish version.\nThis task was completed by Norman\nThomas di Giovanni who stayed with Borges\n(who has been slowly going blind) in\nBuenos Aries from 1968 to 1972. Borges\nhimself describes the style of the stories\nas Baroque, 'that style which deliberately\nexhausts (or tries to exhaust) all its possibilities and which borders on its own\nparody'...\nThe book chronicles the lives of certain\nfamous villains( Billy the Kid and the\nTichbourne daimen t are but two). Borges\nthrows in a hoax or two (something for\nwhich he is apparently now famous) by in venting stories and ascribing them to a previous author (and giving references). I especially liked the set of very short tales\nin which human villainy gets its just\nreward, becoming the victim of fate, enchantment or its own perversity. The title of\nthis section of the book is ' Etcetera', which I thought quite a nice touch.

IF YOU have ever had sympathies for\nthe vegetarian viewpoint, but have been\ndeterred from taking the plunge by fear of\nnot being able to get a balanced diet, or\nby your image of the \" food fad dist\", this\nmay be a book to change your mind.\nMs Lappe' kicks off by giving some\nastonishing statistics; like half ot the US\ngrain harvest, much of which could be\nconsumed by human, goes down the\ngullets of livestock, which convert only\none tenth of this back to edible protein.\nShe tries to dispel the myth that every\nmeal must contain meat, and introduces\nnutritional concepts like amino-acid\nbalance, explaining them in layman s terms. Comprehensive tables are then\ngiven which allow you to work out which\nfoods are best combined to yield the\nrequired protein.

    "content": "s Peter Patter\nHello! This is my first article in FELIX and I approach it with some trepidation,\nparticularly as it is for the P.G. issue. Having spent three years here as an undergraduate I seem to have little grasp of the\nmany problems facing P. G.s.I am anxious\nto learn, and you are the only people that\ncan provide me with a knowledge of PG affairs. Below I intend to set out some problems as I see them. If you don't agree, then\ntell me so the next time you see me.\nCVC P report on PG's One of the most noticeable developments\naffecting PG s for sometime was the publication of the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principal's( CVC P) Report on\nPost-Graduate education. Many people have\nlooked-forward to its publication and I am\nsure they will all be quite satisfied with\nthe results. It has stated in simple terms\nmany of the feelings which Postgraduates\nhave held for a considerable time. At last a body of reasonable power has set down on\npaper, that it feels that the PG grant is in adequate. They rightly, say that 'It takes\nlittle or no account of the fact that research\nstudents are older, better qualified, more\nexperienced and more capable than the\naverage undergraduate'. I hope that this\nstatement will lead to some action, and a revision of the PG grant system. The college will be setting up a committee to discuss the report and to ascertain its relevance to Postgraduate education within the\ncol leg e. Refectory prices\nAs those of you who have been eating in\nthe refectories this summer will have\nnoticed the refectory prices went up by 40%\non 1st September. This increase is massive\nin proportion, compared to the increases in\nPG and UG grants and makes many local\ncafes and rest aur aunts much more com petit The President, Peter Teague writes\non the present state of student affairs\nin Imperial College.\nive. I hope that you will all look around to\nget the best value for your money, whether\nthis means eating out of College or bringing\nsandwiches. Postgraduates are affected\nmore serous ly than others by an increase at\nthis time of year as the PG grant is not in creased until October. We made this point\nquite clear to the College Governing Body.\nThey delayed the increase from 1st August\nuntil 1st September but were unwilling to\ndelay it any longer. So the Postgraduates\nbear the brunt of the increases again! At the second Union Meeting of next term it is\nhoped that we will be able to take some\naction towards this Increase. Your ideas\nand comments will be appr ici a ted at or\nbefore that meeting.\nAccomodation for married PG's Approximately 40% of the students at IC\nare postgraduates and looking back over\nprevious years the Union does not seem to\nhave achieved a great deal for postgraduates. This year perhaps more can be done,\nalthough I appreciate that good intentions\nare not enough. One project that I persona ll y, feel we should take up with the College, is the lack of ac como dati on for married\npostgraduates, I was also surprised at the\nlack of social events for those students in\nCollege over the summer. Do you feel that\nthere is a demand for such events? What\nsort of events, if organised, would receive\nyour support?\nDemonstrating cuts\nThe Government, following its policy of\ncutting Public expenditure is expected to\nannounce more Public expenditure cuts in\nthe near future. Education is certain to bear\na large proportion of the cuts and the\neffects will be far reaching. For postgraduates the cuts may first be felt as the\namount of demonstrating may have to be\ncurtailed due to the lack of funds. With a somewhat inadequate PG grant many PG' s rely on demonstrating to supplement their\ngrant and the loss of this source of income\ncould be most damaging in some cases. The amount of finance available for research\nprojects may also have to be reduced. I am\nsure that the College would like to keep up\nthe high level of research for which. IC is renowned,but this will become increasingly\ndifficult in the future. The campaign to\nfight the Education cuts is essentially a campaign to see the higher educational\nsystem we have at present continued.\nPGAO\nMany of the issues which will affect the\nstudents of IC in the coming year will affect\nthe Postgraduates and to represent your\nviews? on these matters adequately it is\nessential that we have a Postgraduate\nAffairs Officer. This post is vacant at the\nmoment, if you are interested I would be\nonly too pleased to chat to you about the\njob. It is a very difficult job and one which\nneeds great motivation.\nI have outlined some of the events of past\nand future which affect Postgraduates. You form about 4 0 % of the student body of IC and are 40% of the membership of IC Union\nIf you don't feel that the Union achieves\nenough for postgraduates please tell me,\nbut be prepared to join in yourself. IC Union is your Union as much as it is the\nundergraduates Union. I am sure that we\ncan achieve a great deal for PG s in the\nfuture but you must tell us the issues that\nyou want us to take up, and be prepared to\nwork with us to see that some progress is\nmade.\nPGA O resignation-the President replies\n/ feel that I should reply, on behalf of\nthe Union, to the article on the resignation of Karl Ibrikian who was to have\nbeen next year's Postgraduate Affairs\nOfficer. I am sorry that Karl thought it\nnecessary to resign as I feel that we could\nhave worked quite well together, and achieved a great deal for the PG's at IC.\nMany references are made to the lack\nof power vested in the PGAO. The post\ncarries as much power as any other on the\nUnion Council, and the debate about the\nPGAO being a member of the Executive\nwas fully aired last session. One must\nnot forget that the post of the PGAO has\nonly been in existence for three years.\nThis is quite a short time when one considers changing the complete structure of\nthe Union.\nTurning to the finances of the Postgraduate Group, Karl says that ICWA\nrepresents fewer people but receives more\nmoney. Firstly may I point out that ICPGG\nonly submitted a claim tor \u00a3360 for this\nsession. The Union Finance Committee\ncan hardly be expected to hand out money\nabove that claimed. The claim submitted\nwas extremely sketchy and contained no\ndetailed budgeting and therefore adequate\nroom was left for trimming down the claim.\nSecondly I would argue that the number of\npeople participating in those events organised by a particular group was a far\nbetter guide to the amount of money needed than the number of people that a group\nrepresents.\nKarl should realise that the President\ncan not change the structure of IC Union,\nhowever much he sometimes wishes he\ncould. The only body that can do this is\nis a Union General Meeting, and these\ndo not seem to be attended by many PG's.I would now like to consider the\ndemands of the postgraduates. I can see\nnothing at all wrong with the Union financing ICPGG to the tune of \u00a31000. We\ncannot be expected to do this unless the\n\u00a31000 Is claimed for, and justifiable. The\nprovision of a PG lounge within the Union\nBuilding would be a little difficult at the\nmoment. I wonder it this is some form of\nelitism wishing to keep PG's separate\nfrom UG's, or a demand made while looking at the ICWA lounge. If it is the latter,\nthen people must realise the historical\nreasons for ICWA having its own lounge.\nIt goes back to the time of the 'men-only'\nUnion Bar. Two places in Hall are demanded by the PG's. Most of the other\nsectors of the Union only have one officer\nthat can take a LHtkm place in Hall. Why\ndo the PG's feel that they need two?\nSuch a move would need a constitutional\nchange and until that was possible I had\npromised Karl one of the President's nominee places . Since his resignation\nthe place has had to go to an undergraduate officer as there is no PGAO to take\nup the place. Finally it seems that all we\"\nreceive from the ICPGG are demands, and no requests or suggestions of ways in\nwhich we can work closer together. Does\nICPGG want to be a part of the Union or\nan independent group ?\nTo answer Tom Abraham'sco om men tsI would only say that the Union Council\nhas five postgraduate members, excluding\nthe PGAO, and it can only be more representative with him than without him.\nSurely it you feel under-represented the\nlast thing that you should do Is take\naway the representative that you have.\nI would like to see more done this\nyear for postgraduates, but I wonder whether Karl's methods are the best for\nachieving the postgraduates aims.\n\n"

Karl Ibrikian's resignation asP GAO has not helped in the very important\nquestion of postgraduate representation\nin IC Union. On the contrary, it has\ndestroyed any basis there might have\nexisted for discussing and hopefully\nfinding a solution, if indeed one exists, within the present context and structure\nof the Union.

Sec. in the coming year.\nI hope you will use the Union, if only\nto get half-price rail fares, which, by\nsome curious coincidence brings me to my\nfirst piece of information. After much dilly dallying British Rail have announced that\nthe new Rail cards will cost \u00a35.40 and\nwill run for a year from 1st October. You can obtain your Rail card either by post\n(forms will be available in the Union\nOffice) or at Euston. However, all those\nrequiring a Rail card will have to possess\na registration card.\nThis brings up another couple of bits\nof tittle-tattles. Firstly, a passport photo\nwill be required for this year's Union\ncard; secondly, students are needed for\nthe first three days of the Autumn term to\nman the desks where the registration\ncards (complete with photos) will be\nstamped. The Union will be paying \u00a31.00\nper hour to anyone able to man a desk, so if you need some extra cash let me know.\nAt these desks there will also be three\nhandbooks available \u2014 the ICU,N US, and\nUL U handbooks \u2014 and these will contain\ninformation on welfare, the law etc. and\nare absolutely free. Please make sure you\ntake one (or all) of these handbooks.\nAnother delicate area at the moment Is\nac como dati on.

In addition, ICWA is running a similar scheme to cater specifically for flat shar lng.

Despite much\narm waving however, the patrol\ncar crawled past us. It returned\nlater and this time Ri z, Mark\nCaldwell and myself stood in the middle of the road to flag\nthem down. When asked if they\nwere looking for IC Union they\n| replied in the negative but\ncame in to investigate. We went up to the gym and\nat the sight of 50 kung-fu\ntrainees the officers paled\nconsiderably. They asked Mr\nChang outside to discuss the\nmatter and a furious argument\nensued. Mr Chang did a complete volt face and the\nofficers simply could* not\naccept that the Union Building was in Ri z' s charge.\nIn the end the police, took\nparticulars, allowed the lesson to continue ( with only 2 0\nminutes of it left) and left\nrather hurriedly.\nThe Union Building was locked-up by the DP for the\nwhole of last week-end in order to stop any unauthorised\npersons using the gym. They\nare being allowed to continue\nto use the gym once a week at \u00a37 a session plus a50% discount on lesson fees for\nIC students. IC students will however, have to pay the\nsubscription fee of \u00a33.50 a year.\nRi z has also received a personal apology from Mr Chang and the matter is now resolved.\nSeaford snubs N UP E agreement\nTHE CLEANING ladies in L instead and Southside Halls of\nResidence began a work-to-rule last Monday in protest against\nthe decision by Carl Seaford, the College Domestic Bursar, to\nignore an agreement made by the College and N UP E( the public\nemployees* trade union) over bonuses to be paid during the\nsummer.\nIt is during the long\nvacation that L instead and Southside are used as hotels\nfor conferences and summer\ntourists. The extra workload\nfor the cleaning ladies in this\nperiod is known to be substantial .\nAbout a month before the\nhotel scheme commenced, Mr Ted Fisher( the branch\nsecretary) and Mrs Alice Fe a sey( shop steward) acting on behalf of N UP E entered into\nan agreement with the College, which was represented by Mr\nA. O.Ro land,( the as st. Personnel Secretary) and Mrs\nAudrey Podhajsky (the as st. Domestic Bursar). The- agree-ment, which was made in Mr\nSeaford's absence due to illness, stated that out of the\nmonies accrued from the. hotel\nscheme, the cleaners in L instead and Southside\nwould receive a \u00a34 per week\nbonus on account of the extra\nworkload involved. The figure of \u00a34 was worked out\nfrom the definite conference\nbookings which were known at the time the agreement was made. Additionally, a percentage\nof the monies accrued from\nthe casual letting s was to be\nforwarded to the cleaners at a later date as a Christmas bonus.\nNo provision was made for the\n\" Northside\"( Weeks, Garden\nand Be it Halls of Residence)\ncleaners since they did not\nhandle the hectic summer\nvisitor traffic and they already\nwere receiving a year round\nbonus of \u00a31 .50 per week and\nworking an extra hour each day.\nThe dispute arose when Mr\nSeaford recently decided to pay\nthe Northside cleaners a \u00a32.50\nper week bonus, which with\nthe \u00a3 1 5 0 per week made a total of \u00a34 per week. The new\nbonus is to be backdated to\nthe beginning of the summer.\nThe Southside and L instead cleaners were angry at the\nunfair financial advantage being\nshown to the Northside cleaners.

When he spoke to FELIX, Mr Ibrikian pointed out that\nICWA which represents far fewer people enjoys priv i ledges and has facilities denied to the\nICP GG.

    "content": "FILIX 7\nCricket\nA report on the recently completed summer tour, by the\nSports Editor, Andrew Hall.\nfrom our own correspondent in Southside.\nThis is a story of alo chola lg ip an, of cricket ing and\nchun de ring and of a dedicated\nband of batsmen and boozers\nwho, when assembled at the end\nof last term, comprised the IC\nCricket Club Tour Party (1975).\nThe tour involved 10 matches\nin as many days; intensive yet\nenjoyable cricket played\nagainst the inhabitants of the\nfriendly hamlets of the Southwest (at least we hope they are\nstill friendly). The tour started well when\nJohn England in his Volkswagen\ncrossed the river three times\nwh i Ist looking for the M3 . He\ncaught up with the minivan near\nSouthampton and on arrival at\ntheir ground we were told that\nthey had \" only6 players at the\nmoment\" and no match ball, so\nwe lent them John Thornback\n(Hon Sec) and then lost. A cracking start! (Southampton\nUniversity II 199 - 7, J. Thorn back46; IC103). For the next seven matches\nwe were based in Torguay in a rather grim hotel with the\nstandard number of \" Polite Notices\". The second'match against\nThe long, hot summer is\ndrawing to a close, and the\nCollege will soon resound to\nthe noise of undergraduates.\nSocial and sporting activities for the 1600 postgraduates during this time has been none xi stent. The PG' s contribute\nup to 40 per cent of the Union's total budget, which, for the\ncoming year is about \u00a380,000.\nThis money has already been\nallocated to various sections of\nthe Union. It is up to every\npostgraduate student to try and\nget his money's worth from the\nUnion . It is pointless sitting\nback and complaining about the\nlack of social and sporting activities suitable for post-graduates. If you feel strongly\nabout it, come to a meeting of\nthe ICP GG or see your departmental PG reps and express your feelings. Postgraduates\nhave got to come forward and\nhelp organise and participate\nactively in these events, other-wise the undergraduates will continue to enjoy a disproportionate amount of the total\nbudget .\nYelverton Bohemiams ended in\nan exciting draw in which both\nsides could have won (IC 148;\nYelverton Bohemians 147 \u2014 8 ) .\nThey are in danger of losing\ntheir picturesque pitch to\ndevelopers and we wish them\nsuccess in their fight.\nThe next day (after having\nleft the score book at Yelverton)\nwe were hammered by an Exeter team, containing several\nminor county players, which is\ntop of the Devon League (Exeter\n213 - 8; IC 7 8 ) .\nWe struggled to a draw\nagainst Plymouth College staff after a batting collapse( Plymouth College1648; IC\n74 \u2014 9 ) . Our side was then\nfortified by the arrival of Rob Young and Chris York for the\nweekend and we beat Brixham\nhandsomely on the Saturday\n(IC 149, R. Young52; Brixham\n46 ; N. Treen 5 for 1 8 ) .\nA very slow and boring\nbatting performance only\nenlivened by a brisk 42 not out\nfrom John England set the tone\nfor a draw against Plymstock\nhowever, some more excellent batting by Nick\" Ironman\" Treen gave the match a close Certain sections of the PG g rou p ha ve ex pressed the opinion that since We as a whole do not\ntake an active part in the Union, there is no need for the grant\nawarding body to contribute any\nUnion dues . This may save the\ntaxpayer some money, but not\nonly is it unfair on the 10 to20 per cent of the PG' s who do\ntake an active part, it is a defeatist attitude to which I will not subscribe. The CVC P study group has\nbrought out its report on PG education. One of the consequences of this is likely to be a review of PG education at IC. This, I feel, is not only essen tia I but also long overdue because\nthe present system is highly\nwasteful of resources. Imperial\nCollege has a very good reputation internationally, but I wonder how much of it is due\nto the \" sterling\" research car ried out here. It is pointless\nto blame either the academic\nstaff or the postgraduate students\nfor the quality of research, because the system precludes any\nserious work.\nThe major proportion of the\nresearch is carried out by PG' s. In some quarters it has been\nstated that PG's are basically\ntrainee research workers . If that\nis the case it is pointless to\nexpect high quality research\nfrom them. I would further add\nthat two out of their three years\nare a waste of time and money,\nsince one year is more than\nadequate for research training.\nI feel a much better system\nwould be to have a one year\ntraining period, followed by a two year period under contract\nas a research worker. This\nwould be renewable for further\nperiods depending on the ability\nof the individual student. The\nmain benefits which will accrue\nare that the potenti a I of capable\nstudents will be fully utilised\nand secondly it will encourage\nthe staff to adopt a more responsible attitude.\nFrom the student point of\nview, the major advantage is\nthat you become a fully fledged\nsalaried research worker. Admittedly this sort of system\nwould only really work in a place like IC where most of the\nresearch work carried out is of\na practical nature.\nAlthough in the short term\nthis will prove to be more ex-pensive, in the long term it\nwould be far more beneficial.\nI believe that even the 'cost-effectiveness' maniacs at the\nTreasury will adopt a mere\n.sympathetic view of this sort of\n\"system than they do of the existing one.\nBBC TELEVISION AND THE ROYAL INSTITUTION\npresent\nPROFESSOR JOHN TAYLOR\nDept.of Mathematics, King's College, University of London,\narguing that\nSCIENTISTS ARE STIFLING SCIENCE\nagainst his critics\nat\nTHE ROYAL INSTITUTION\n21 Albemarle Street, London W. l.5 AS pm on Wednesday, 17th September, 197S with\nPROFESSOR SIR GEORGE PORTER\nin the Chair.\nPARTICIPATION IN THE DISCUSSION WELCOMED\nTickets available from Riz Shakir, Union Office \u2022 Please\nhurry, first come first served .\nfinish (IC 1 3 9 - 6 ; Plymstock\n128 - 8).\nThe highlight of the tour was\nas usual, the Bannacombe game.\nOnly a20 over evening match\nplayed on their amazing bowl-like pitch; the square is at\nleast 20 feet below the\nboundaries; the ball rolling back\nto the batsman from square leg!
