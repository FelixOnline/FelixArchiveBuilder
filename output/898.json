    "content": "Editorial\nIt's been a bit of an interesting week. The ICU Hustings at St Mary's was, by all\naccounts, something of an event. As1 write the 'in house' hustings are taking\nplace in the JCR. My life has been fraught\nwith disasters, culminating in a rather\nsever (as anyone there could tell you)\ndrinking session last night, in which I made full use of the midnight bar\nextension. Thankfully I'm feeling much better today, mainly due to some serious\nthinking at about 4.00 am this morning.\nThere have also been some rather\nwonderful things going on that have\ncome to my attention...\nBankers. Big, stupid, ugly bankers\nHere's a bit of fun. See if you can work\nout the bank's reasoning in the following\nsituation: A student at Imperial has two\noverdrafts. One is with Natwest (the\nbranch in college), and one with Barclays\n(his home branch). Both of the overdrafts\nare large (the Barclays one just under\n\u00a32000, the Natwest roughly twice that).\nThe student gets a full grant, his parent\ncannot afford to give him any more\nmoney, and has no savings or income of\nany other kind, other than that which he\nearns by working during term time or\nholidays (although holidays are something\nof a problem, as he lives in the country,\nand doesn't drive).\nWith debts of this size he realises that\nhe really should be a good boy and not\nmake them any larger. Thus, being an\noptimistic type, he decides to live on his\ngrant (ho, ho, ho). At this point in the\nyear he's not doing so badly. He hasn't used his bank accounts at all, and has\nsent a letter to both banks, explaining\nthat he has thrown his cheque-book\naway, and will be paying back as much as he can over the summer. Seem fair\nenough?\nThen, in their infinite wisdom(?), Barclays decide to ask the student for\ntheir money. Only they do it by sending\nhim a court summons. So the student\nrings the bank, to explain the situation.\nThen, guess what? The bank says 'It's out\nof our hands, you'll have to speak to the\nsolicitors'. So the student rings the\nsolicitors, and explains the situation (ie he\nhas no money). Guess What? The solicitors say 'There's nothing we can do.\nWe have to try to get the money for our\nclient'. 'But' says the student 'I have no\nmoney'. Guess what? The solicitors say\nthere's nothing they can do. If the student\ncan't raise just under \u00a32000 in30 days,\nit's going to court.\nNow perhaps I'm missing something,\nbut the way I see it, \u00a32000 is not a huge\namount of money in terms of what you can actually buy with it. I have friends\nback at home who are 18, and have\nabout \u00a330000 worth of debt in the form\nof credit and mortgages. The average\nstarting wage of an IC graduate is around\n\u00a315000. Also, if the student doesn't have\nthe money, what's the point in sue ing? Why not wait until the student graduates,\nand get back the two grand, plus interest,\nand save all the hassle and pointless court\ncases? Or amI missing something? The other thing is that the overdraft wasn't even unauthorised! The bank let the\nstudent have the money! From all\naccounts, they didn't even kick up much of a fuss!\nMore money matters\nHere's some more fun. College\nAccommodation! Why can't Imperial get\nthe hang of it? The college is being run in a more and more business-like manner.\nNew directors are being appointed almost\nweekly, and being paid large (ie a lot\nmore than two grand) amounts of money\nto do whatever they do (?).\nBut is accommodation being run well?\nThe rent in Southside is \u00a347 a week at\nthe moment. Next year it will be going\nup to \u00a350. Yet in my first year (two years\nago), it was only \u00a345. And I seem to\nremember being assured that it would be\nfrozen for three years. Hmmm. There are\nother colleges in London which own residences on Cromwell Road, and charge\nonly \u00a320-30 a week.\nThe accommodation office apparently\nhas large debts to pay off. But why do\nthey have big debts anyway? I admit that\nthings can go wrong in business, but\nthere comes a point when you have to\nwonder how much is bad luck, and how much is bad management?\nNow, to top it off, they're charging\nstudents full rent to leave their stuff in their rooms over the Easter holidays! The reason for this appears to be to get the\nstudents out of hall, as the conference\nletting has apparently been over\nsubscribed by about 2 0 % . But the best\nthing is that they're doing it to students\nwho live in halls that aren't even being\nused for the letting scheme. AND the\ndecision was apparently made without\nconsulting ANY of the people that should\nhave been. Ho, ho, ho, what a great bit\nof fun! What a pile of smelly stuff that\nyou wouldn't want to be in, more like.\nCredits\nPrinting and Typesetting: Andy and\nRose\nNews Editor: Anna Arts Editor: Adam T Books Editor: Michael\nMusic Editor: John\nPhoto Editor: Richard\nFeatures Editor: Roland\nThe Gang: Stef, James, Ian, Jonti, Nigel,\nand all the reviewers.\nThe Collators: All the stalwarts, and\nanybody else that turns up.\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London SW72 BB( Tel0712258672).

    "content": "The Slow Moving Snail wishes you were here then...\nSuch, Such Were the Joys mm\nOver the years Imperial College and its\nconstituents have celebrated numerous\nanniversaries. With all the name changes\nthat have gone on during its history\nevery year becomes an opportunity to\ncelebrate, or milk it for fund-raising\npublicity. Luckily, for us, they have also\nbeen used to publish historical accounts\nof the college.\nAs a young undergraduate I walked to\nlectures, across Princes Gardens, with a feeling of being a part of an exciting\nhistory. This was the planned centre of\nscientific excellence promoted by the\nPrince Consort, a place where great men\nand women had studied and taught. I felt\nproud to be here, in a small way\nbecoming a part of this tradition.\nThere are at least five books, available\nin college, that describe the birth and\ndevelopment of Imperial. The best for the\nprice, pictorial and language style, is the\naward-winning publication, Imperial\nCollege by Imperial College Archives.\nThis is a small, high quality colour\nbooklet, aptly suitable for parental coffee\ntables offering one-up man ship on filial\nsuccess, and for quoting snippets to those\npoor friends at less historical places. It\ngives an invaluable summary of the\npeople and events behind our history. If\nyou want somewhere to start learning a bit about what this college represents\nthere is no better place.\nA more comprehensive study, Science\nfor Industry, is provided by A. Rupert\nHall, once Professor of the History of\nScience here. It is disappointing in that,\nthough it fills the details in, it does not\nprovide enough explanation about the\nrelationship of the college to wider\nchanges in education and science. Much is assumed, for instance the 1870 Forster\nEducation Act launched state education in\nthis country, though this is not explained.\nAlso there is a lack of an index. His\nPreface states that this is the first attempt\nat an overview of the history since 1907.\nAs such it is worth a read. If only he had\nwritten about the 'history of the student\nas social phenomena' and filled the gap\nhe acknowledged existed in the history of\ncolleges.\nA book, Breaking the Shackles,\npublished by an IC student, does look\nmore at what it was like to be a student\nhere one hundred years ago. The author\nuses quotes from H.G. Wells' novels and\nshort stories to compare Wells' life as a student here with his own experiences. It\nprovides an enlightening and\ncontroversial picture of learning, within\nthe wider frame of the present debates\nabout national curriculum and education\nstandards.\nThese are all inexpensive good reads.\nTwo further volumes are large and\nexpensive, suitable for the study shelf\nrather than the coffee stained table tops.\nA Hundred Years of Civil Engineering at\nSouth Kensington edited by Joyce Brown and City and Guilds College - A Centenary History are books I will\nreserve a week to read.\nA fascinating look at the relationship\nbetween politics and science, The Visible\nCollege by Gary Werskey, describes the\nlives of British Scientists who linked their\nscience to their socialism. Hymen Levy,\nDean of the Royal College of Science\n(1947-52), receives a comprehensive\ncoverage. He was a famous populariser of\nscience - writing and appearing on\ntelevision and radio. For those who think\nthis place is non-political this will be an\neducational book.\nMost of these books are available from\nthe ICU Bookstore. The Archives booklet\ncosts \u00a32:75 from Archives (Level 4\nSherfield). The Visible College can be\nordered from any good bookshop\n(published by Free Association Books,\nISBN 1- 85343-014-5).\nkK Son ers Poisoning\nthe World\nin Steps\nSecond Stride is an award-winning dance\ngroup who have successfully\nexperimented with movement, music, the\nspoken and sang word as means of\nexploring the motives, emotions and ideas\nbehind four poisoners. Lives of the Great\nPoisoners portrays Dr Crippen, Medea\nand Marquise de Brinvilliers.\nThe fourth character is one who gives\nthis highly exhilarating piece a wider\nmoral view. Thomas Midgley was a brilliant scientist who discovered the antiknock properties of lead compounds in\npetrol and found the first practical\napplication of CFCs. His work has\ntherefore contributed to the present\nenvironmental threats to our communities\nand planet. As a scientist he was highly\ndramatic, presenting his findings in a theatrical style on a stage. To show the\nharmless nature of CFCs he breathed in\nthe gas and blew out a candle with it.\nThe tragic irony of his early death (he\nwas strangled by a system of pulleys he\nhad designed to move his disabled body\naround his house) appears as a powerful\nimage of the unseen circumstances of our\nscience and technology.\nAll scientists should go to see how this\n'outstanding array of creative talents'\nhave portrayed the values of their\nsubject. The production runs from\nTuesday 12 to Saturday 16th March, 7:30\npm at the Riverside Studios, Crisp Road,\nHammersmith (near the tube). Box Office\n081 748 3354. Ticket prices S7.50/&5.50\nreductions.\n10\n\n"

    "content": "M Obituary\nLord\nPenney\nLord Penney, OM, KBE, FRS, creator of\nthe British atom bomb and Rector of\nImperial between 1967 and 1973, died on\nMarch 3rd of this year, aged 81.\nWilliam Penny was one of the most\noutstanding mathematicians and physicists\nof his generation. In 1944 he travelled to\nAmerica to work an the Manhattan\nproject; the project culminated in the\ninvention of the World's first atom bomb.\nIn 1947 Lord Penney was put in charge\nof the development of a British atom\nbomb. According to the Independent\nNewspaper, he was 'an active and\ninspiring leader' during atomic testing in\nAustralia in the early 1950's. Over thirty\nyears later an Australian Royal Commission investigating the testing\nheard evidence that the tests had been\nunsafe. When questioned by the\ncommission Lord Penney acknowledged\nthat he had devised a way of misleading\nAustralian scientists about the radiation\nlevels an nuclear dust clouds, providing\nthem with samples that were a few days\nold, so that some of the short-lived key\nisotopes had decayed.\nLord Penney was appointed chairman\nof the United Kingdom Atomic Energy\nAuthority ( UK EAE A) in 1964. On his\nretirement from the UK EAE A in 1967 he\nwas appointed rector of Imperial College.\nIn 1935 Lord Penney married his first\nwife Adele Elms, who died in 1944. They\nhad two sons. He married again in 1945,\nto Joan Quennel.\nIllegal\nA new student broadsheet, distributed\naround Imperial College campus this\nweek, is illegal. The one page first edition\nof 'The Free Student' fails to include the\nprinter's name, thus contravening\npublishing law. The Free Student is\npublished under the auspices of the\nConservative Party and is based at Party\nHeadquarters Smith Street.\nThe Youth co-or d in at or at Conservative\nheadquarters described the omission of\nthe printer's name as an 'error'. He\nrefused to release the telephone number\nof the editor of 'The Free Student', Rob\nMarven. The Youth co-or d in at or did not\nwant the gentleman concerned 'pestered'.\nHe then claimed that he had overall\neditorial responsibility for the publication\neven though his name did not appear on\nthe credits.\nThe publication states that it aims to\npromote 'individual freedom of choice'\nand to 'fight against socialism in colleges\nacross the country'. According to a source\nat Tory HQ the 'Conservative Students'\nbased the tabloid format of 'Free Student'\non the left of centre publications.\nHustings Hassle\nThe Sabbatical candidates were given a rough ride at the St Mary's hustings. The\ncandidates arrived at the Medical School's union just at the close of a happy hour\non Monday evening. One candidate said\n'It was like holding hustings in the middle\nof a RCS beer festival'.\nDespite Imperial Union Honorary\nSecretary Murray Williamson explaining\nthe purpose of the meeting to assembled\nstudents, candidates were heckled with\ncalls of 'What are you doing here?'. One\ncandidate was sufficiently offended by the\nheckling to lodge an official complaint\nwith Imperial College Union.\nMurray Williamson said that hustings at\nSt Mary's next year are unlikely. He\nstated that the only reason hustings were\nheld in past years at St Mary's was\nbecause Imperial's were scheduled over\nlunch-times. He thought that next year\nthere would be one evening hustings on\nthe Imperial campus.\nThis year's hustings at Imperial were on\nThursday 7th March in the JCR. Voting\ntakes place on the 11th and 12th March\nin all departments.\nCandidates standing for the Sabbatical\nposts of Imperial College Union are as\nfollows:\nPresident Zoe Hellinger, Adrian Johnson,\nSpenser Lane, Michael Newman Deputy President Jonathan Griffiths\nHonorary Secretary Steve Farrant\nFelix Editor Adam Harrington\n2\n\n"

    "content": "Yasmin Saudi gives her opinion on the recent Jewish Society exhibition.\nFacts and Figures? OPINION The Middle East...it's a long but\nun complete story.\nComments on the main titles of the\nJewish Soceity Exhibition\nAt the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury, the Middle East was a single unit\ncontaining many contrasting people. Such\ndisparity caused the unit to crumble.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth\ncentury the Middle East consisted of the\nOttoman Empire, Egypt, Oman and Aden which was directly under the British\nempire. The Arab world is fairly\nhomogeneous in its values, traditions,\nculture, history and language.\n'Contrasting' is non-descriptive of the\nArab people. The division of the eastern\nArab world into many states followed the\nSykes-Picot agreement in 1916 and the\nimplementation of British and French\nmandates in the region. The exhibition\nimplied that Israel came into existence in\nthe same way as the Arab states did. It\nshould be clarified that while the Arab\nstates gained their independence from the\nBritish and the French mandates, the UN General Assembly set a partition plan for\nPalestine in October 1947, to create two\nstates, one for the Jews and one for the\nArabs, and to allot the Jewish state 56.6\nper cent of the land of Palestine of which90 per cent was Arab owned and 50 per\ncent Palestinian Arab populated. The\ncreation of Israel was accompanied by\nthe expulsion of two thirds of the\nPalestinians living in the area* The\nindependence of Israel was not the\nindependence of the indigenous people of\nPalestine.\nUnder the title 'Use Your Democratic\nRights', the exhibition conveyed the idea\nof the absence of democracy from the\nMiddle East apart from Israel.\nWhile democracy does not constitute an\nintegral part of most Arab regimes, it is\nnot absent. Egypt has licensed parties and\nthere is a fair degree of freedom of the\npress. In Jordan, democratic elections\ntook place recently and the press is\nrelatively open. Yemen and Algeria are\npreparing for democratic elections. In the\ndeclaration of Independence of May 1948,\nthe principle of equality between Jews\nand Arabs in the new state of Israel was\nproclaimed. In practice, Israel has yet to\nabolish discrimination and inequality\nbetween the two political and social\nrights (eg the Absentee Property Law of\n1950, Law of Return, discrimination in\nmunicipal finance and job hire).\nThey supported international terrorism\nand sent their own people to murder\nworldwide.\n'They' above refers to the Arab states. It\nshould have been specified that the only\nstates that are linked to terrorism are\nSyria, Libya and Iraq.\nSo appalling violence has prevailed\nirrespective of Israel's existence.\nViolence and upheaval have been\nworsened by the impact of Israel, whose\ndefeat of the Arab states in 1948 and\n1967 undermined their governments.\nIsrael has meddled in Lebanon since the\n1950s. The only movement whose very\nexistence revolved around the destruction\nof Israel was the PLO. Its aims are\nenshrined in its constitution, it has never\nbeen changed. In fact the articles that\nfollowed were taken from the Palestinian\nNational Charter which is not the same as\nthe constitution.\nThe Charter has gone through three\nphases, which are as follows:\nStage One: The 'total liberation' phase\nfrom 64 through to 68. The National\nCharters in that phase were characterised\nby the enormous sense of loss and not by\nthe 'destruction of Israel'. Article 15 of\nthe Palestine National Charter of 1968\nstates that 'The liberation of\nPalestine...aims at the elimination of\nZionism in Palestine' and not the people\nof Israel. There is no mention of\ndestroying Israel, in the sense of killing\nits people.\nStage two: The secular democratic state\nphase from 69 to 73. The liberated\nPalestine envisaged in the Charter as\namended in 1968 and supplemented by\nthe Palestine National Council resolutions\nwas that of a secular democratic states,\nall of whose citizens, regardless of\nreligion or race, would have equal rights\nand opportunities.\nStage Three: The two state solution\nphase, which evolved into an explicit\nspelled-out acceptance of a Palestinian\nstate alongside Israel not as a transitional\nstage but as a final one.\nThe evolution of the PLO's peace\nstrategy was finalised at the adoption of\nThe Political Program and the Declaration\nof Independence by the 19th Palestinian\nNational Council in 1988, together with\nArafat's statement in Geneva a month\nlater. These set the UN Security Council\nResolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for\nconvening an international peace\nconference in the Middle East and\nnegotiations with Israel within the\nframework of the International\nConference. Israel is clearly recognised as\na legitimate state in the PNC's endorsement of the UN General Assembly\npartition resolution as it relates to the\nestablishment of two states in what was\nmandatory Palestine. Diplomacy and\npeaceful settlement are chosen to achieve\nPalestinian goals. Terrorism in all its\nforms\u2014individual, group and state is\nemphatically rejected.\nHence it is evident that after the\nnineteenth PNC in November 1988 in\nAlgiers, the National Charter was to all\nintents and purposes, thought not in\nspecific terms, rescinded, since the basic\npremises of the Declaration of\nIndependence (eg the partition of\nPalestine as the objective and peaceful\nnegotiation as the means of achieving it)\nand the basic premises of the National\nCharter (eg the total liberation of\nPalestine as the objective and armed\nstruggle as the exclusive means of\nachieving it) are fundamentally opposed.\nArafat was correct when during his visit\nto Paris in May1989, he pronounced the\nNational Charter 'ca duc' or 'lapsed',\nthough in the formal sense it is still\noperative.\nBut note the PLO was established in 64.\nIts desire to annihilate Israel had nothing\nto do with the West Bank and Gaza.\nSee above. The PLO is an overall body\nconcerned not only in the political side of\nthe Palestinian life but also in supporting\neducation, health services and Palestinian\nart and culture. It has always sought to\nrebuild Palestinian society and to promote\nthe welfare of the Palestinians. This is\nwhat has made it change its goals from\nthose set out in 1964: it now seems a realistic compromise.\nYasmin Saudi.\n*See the UN General Assembly/Official\nRecord, 6th session, supplement no 16A,1951.

I think\nthey should. Those who complain are the\nsame bunch of pacifist lefties and general\nno-hope rs who can't wait to knock our\ncountry at every opportunity.\nThere were times, during the war, that\nthose of us at home could only watch and\npray that our casualties would be light,\nand thank goodness they were! We were\nstruck from the start by the bravery of\nour pilots returning from their raids over\nBaghdad. So calm, so professional, so\nBritish. Our hearts went out to those\nfamilies whose sons, daughters or loved\nones will never return.\nAnd what now? Before the war we\nwere urged to plunge even deeper into\nEurope and turn our backs on our\nAmerican friends. When the chips were\ndown our European 'friends' collapsed.\nWe British did not bottle out because our\nactions are not guided by national\ninterest as by our national character. In\nthe 2nd WorldWar we took on Hitler to\ndefend the rights of weaker countries as\nwe have done in the Gulf. We also\nSad But True\nshowed that jumped up Argie dictator\nGaltieri that we would stand firm on the\nFalklands. It just wouldn't have seemed\nright to sit back and let the Yanks fight\nalone. This historic alliance of the Union\nJack and the Stars and Stripes has been\nforged in the blood of our heroes.\nWe must never forget those who lost\ntheir lives fighting for this country in any\nbattle or war. The victory parade will\nprovide an end to this latest chapter\nwhich is important for the troops. It will\nshow how proud of the Boys we really\nare and how proud we are in our great\ncountry. Ignore all these lefties who say\nbelief in the Union flag is wrong. It is not!\nI will probably be called jingoistic for\nwriting this letter. Jingoism comes from\nthe following 19th century poem:\nWe don't want to fight,\nBut by Jingo if we do,\nWe've got the ships,\nWe've got the men, We've got the money too.\nAnd what the hell is wrong in that?\nThe very best of British,\nAlan Bailey (newly elected SCC Political\nRep).\nP.S. When's the debate?\nDear Andy,\nYou are probably reading this letter\nduring a lecture\u2014why not I wrote it\nduring one? Lectures round here seem to\nfall into two categories; those you can\nsleep in and those in which you practise\nyour handwriting. We are constantly\nfaced with being slowly lulled to sleep by\nthe never ending voice of some professor,\ntalking about notes he has already\ndistributed in printed form; followed by a session of furiously copying the\nblackboard to save Imperial's photocopiers\u2014never understanding, just\ncopying. I could have collected notes and\ncopied the board when I was six; only\nbetter then as I wasn't short-sighted.\nI only had one really good teacher at\nschool,- but he knew his job so well that\nhe made all our other teachers look\nextremely poor. In his lessons at least\n80% of what was said came from pupils;\nthis way he could get a large amount of\nfeedback on how much the class\nunderstood and what speed to go.\nEverything would be covered twice in a lesson. First time he would just let\nanybody in the class suggest how to\nproceed, the other time he would pick on\nindividuals, moving around every so\noften. His choice of material was\nexcellent, just too difficult for any one\nperson to do, but the whole class could\nmanage, and the combination of\ncontributing and being picked on kept\neveryone interested.\nThe problem with lecturers here in Elec\nEng is that the student is just a passive\nobserver, the lecturer has no way of\nknowing how much has been understood.\nIt is easier to sit back and daydream than\nit is to concentrate and people will\nnormally opt for the easiest thing to do.\nJames Rouse, Elec Eng 2.\nMend-a Bike\nPETER THOMAS46 Effie Road\nFulham, London SW6 ITD\n071-371 5867\n18\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs\nFootball\nIC II\u20146 SOP2 IC resumed their season after the recent\nweather in t eruptions with an easy victory\nover poor opposition. Hattrick hero A Jalan, C Gilmour the canny Scot and the\ninevitable S Barry gave IC a five goal\nhalf-time lead. An early 2nd half goal by\nthe ' MAB DO' made it six. By then the\nresult wasn't in doubt. The main question\nwas whether N Leonard the IC Captain\nwould win an early bath award from the\nRef.\nIC V7 IC IV1 On a typically windy day at Harlington\nthe fifth team dealt out a lesson in the\nfiner arts of football that the fourths will\nnever forget. Deciding to battle against\nthe elements in the first half the fifths\nplayed at a lightening pace with\nHendrickson opening the scoring five\nminutes from the off. Reece added the\nsecond shortly after and the fourths fell\nto pieces. Stevens added a third and\nFenton with a fine individual effort made\nit 4-0 at half time.\nAfter conceding a goal after the interval\nHendrickson and A wale proved there's more than one way to skin a fullback as\nthe lumbering Damon Thomas and\ncolleagues were left for dead time and\nagain. Collison also scored as the fourth\nteam were left as spectators at their own funeral of football inadequacy. In a season of ups and downs for the fifths,\nthis magnificent seven must be the\nsweetest victory of all.\nLadies Football\nDribblers\u201411 UCL0 Sunday saw the Dribbler's first game for\nthree weeks and their first game under\nnew coach Neil Leonard. It was a nervous\nmorning for the Captain. A9o 'clock\nmeet had been scheduled but a drunken\nDebbie Williams had been misinforming\nnaive dribblers as to where and when we\nwould meet. After an hour, with a team\nfinally assembled, the Dribbler's set off to\nthe Chisslehurst Grounds. The Dribblers\nwere keen to put Neil's new tactics into\npractice but no one could have dreamed\nhow successful they would be. The team\npassed to each other, Ethel ran around,\nPermi didn't fall over and Nina, yes Nina,\nscored a goal! Hope, finding herself\nmarked by everyone bar the goalie,\nplayed a brilliant game throughout,\nscoring a hattrick in the process. The\nremaining gol as came from Permi (5), Jo\n(1) and a UCL defender who, having\nrealised that scoring past Emma Simpson\nwas out of the question, slotted one past\nher own goalie. Even the defender tried\nto get in on the act with Ethel and\nRachel going on several good runs (yes\nEthel does run occasionally) up the pitch\ninto previously unknown territory for the\nDribbler's defence.\nAll in all, a great game for the\nDribblers and, alas, the final game for\nNina Gascoigne. Nina, well known star\nDribbler is crap and has been dropped, I mean she will be away for the remaining\ngames.\nRag\nComic Relief is but a week away. What\nare you planning to do? IC Rag is holding\na Backgammon Marathon in the J CR and\nalso a Circle Line pub crawl, the rest of\nterm has collections planned for Guildford\n(13 March), Covent Garden Panda\nCollection (16 March) and finally\nWindstart Maidenhead (20 March). So\ncome along for a fun day out and help\nimprove on the \u00a32,600 already raised.\nAmnesty\nFrom Tuesday to Thursday of next week,\nthere will be a display in the J CR prepared by the Imperial College Group.\nFour main topics will be covered,\nhighlighting the work of Amnesty International and particularly the college\ngroup.\nOn Tuesday and Thursday lunchtimes,\nthere will be the chance to talk to group\nmembers, who will try and answer any\nquestions about the group, Amnesty's position on such issues as the Gulf crisis\nor its concerns in other areas of the\nworld.\nAs well as the usual letter writing stall\nwhere you are invited to sign pre-written\nletters, there will be a range of Amnesty\ngoods on sale including t shirts, badges,\nkey rings etc. The sale of me chandi se is\nan important source of revenue for\nAmnesty International so we hope you will come along and support this human\nrights charity.\nCross Country\nWith cold, calculated precision the\nwarriors of doom completed their\nextended demolition of the London\ncolleges league in predictably flamboyant\nfashion last Wednesday. And yet, could a hint of emotion be detected as 10 of our\n12 representatives marked their final\nleague race for the college? Nay, twas a mere whim of fancy, for the Torch of\nHarrier Spirit has passed to the safe\nhands of Paul, defying medical science in\nthe name of team honour to hobble\nround in 6th place despite crippling\ninjuries. The 3-lap road race of 10km saw\na prominent phalanx of IC vests\nthroughout, with the ailing Paul initially\nleading a group of Alex, Lazza, Bill and\nFrank. As the distance took its harsh toll,\nit was Frank who s tonk ed through all the\nway up to third, marking his farewell\nappearance with his highest ever placing.\nThe Cult of Alex had detached itself from\nhis youthful pursuers to make8 th even\nyet again, while in their effort to defeat\nthe bane of the league, Bill and Lazza\nproduced a spectacular and vernacular\nfinale to claim 13th and 14th. But the\nbest was yet to come. Master gr unter Edwards had opted to start in last place,\nchoosing to grimace it up the home\nstraight to lead the B team charge. Carl,\nDan, Ian and Dave packed it in between\n41 and 49 to reaffirm our depth of\ninsanity, with Ho Yin also making not i cable improvement. In the two-lap\nwomens race it seemed a formality for\nEdwige to finish a clear second, while\nHelen produced her own brand of heroics\nby failing over at halfway, spraining her\nankle, and then equalling her season's best of ninth. The season's end sees Paul\nthe individual champion by just one\npoint, Edwige second, Frank 3rd and Bill\n5th, with the first team running away\nwith the honours to mark the passing of\nan era.\n16\n\n"

    "content": "Intellectual property rights have caused quite a stir over the years...\nThought = Money?\nThe Beatles, IBM, Kodak, Carlton\nCommunications, The Soviet Government.\nWhat do all these have in common? If\nyou had been present at last week's Physics Department Colloquium then you\nwould have learnt the answer.\nAll of the above are examples of people\ninvolved in court actions over intellectual\nproperty rights, the subject of the talk\ngiven by Mr Clifford Miller, a former IC\nPhysics student.\n'Intellectual property rights' is a broad\nterm covering patents, copyrights,\ntrademarks, designs, brand names,\nservice marks and a whole host of\ndifferent things. It can cover anything\nfrom the design of a chocolate bar to a silicon chip.\nThe importance of intellectual property\nis quite plain; even if you devise similar\ntechnology as another company, as long\nas they hold rights for the use of that\ntechnique you cannot compete in the\nmarket.\nThus it is necessary to take steps to\nprotect any technology and development\nbefore anyone else does.\nFirstly, intellectual property could be\nguarded by patents, the most complex\nmethod available. To patent an invention\nit must usually be new, or have some\nnew aspect to it. Interesting patents\ninclude that held for the process of\nmaking an 'Aero' chocolate bar, the\nprocess used in Polaroid 'instant' cameras,\nand one held by the British Railways\nBoard for a Nuclear Powered spaceship.\nA patent affords your invention a twenty\nyear monopoly, giving protection to\nessential features. If a product is made\nusing all of the main parts then it is\ninfringing the patent.\nThere are two systems for filing an\napplication for a patent. Most countries,\nincluding the United Kingdom, use a 'first\nto file' method: whoever gets there first\nhas the patent. Thus it is very important\nto keep an invention's details completely\nconfidential until the application has been\nmade. In the United States, a first-to-invent system operates: people tend to\npublish details first to show they invented\nit, and then lose their rights in other\ncountries.\nApplications can be a large source of\ninformation on what has already been\ndone- the application must completely\ndisclose the methods and details.\nPatent applications can be costly, and\nafter four years have elapsed the patent\nmust be renewed annually until the\ntwentieth year. This can cost from \u00a3100,\nup to \u00a3350 for a patent in its final year.\nFailure to renew can lead to the lapse of\nthe patent: though a lapse of a patent\ncannot be relied upon to allow an\ninfringement.\nAnother, simple, method of protecting\nyour interests is the law of confidentiality.\nIf you tell someone a piece of information\nthen, as long as you oblige them to\nmaintain its confidentiality, any discussion\nwith someone else breaks the law.\nWell known examples include the\nformula for Coca-Cola, and the recipe for\n'Kentucky Fried Chicken'. This method is,\nhowever,limited if someone else can take\nthe product apart and analyse it: you\nhave then lost your secrecy.\nUsing design protection can also be a way to maintain revenues. In the UK,\ncopyright, design rights, and registered\ndesigns are available to the inventor or\ndesigner. They protect the look of a product.\nIf someone makes use of the effort you\nput into your design then they could be\nimpinging upon your rights.\nA final option for your product is the\nprotection of company names, logos,\npackaging, and the general marks for\nyour product. If a trademark (whether\nregistered, or not) is used for any other\nproduct, where there might be confusion\nover its identity, then they are guilty of\n'passing off. UK law protects a user\nagainst passing off.\nIt is very important, therefore, to\nensure that your new product looks\ntotally different from any other already in\nthe market. This explains the use, by\nLever Bros., of bright orange for the\npackaging of their 'Radion' washing\npowder.\nIf you have an idea which you think is\na winner, I urge you to follow the advice\ngiven by Mr Miller:\n'Tell no-one about it if you can avoid\nit.'\n'If the idea is for a patent able invention...\ndo not lose your rights... by failing to\nmake at least the first patent application.'\n'If you have enough money, fund the\nproduct all the way... yourself.'\nThis article is just a brief, and simple,\nintroduction to intellectual property\nrights. For more information consult the\nbook 'Commercial Exploitation of\nIntellectual Property' by Hilary Pearson\nand Clifford Miller. It covers the whole\nsubject at great depth and is well indexed\nfor referral to most things you could\npossibly want to know.\n9\n\n"

    "content": "Jack& Harry& Their Best Friend Avalon You could tell that you were in a comedy pub. The barman cracked a joke when1 ordered a soft drink. He didn't stop all evening.\nLook, I was on medication, OK? Meanwhile, after an intro stand-up\ncomedian gave us a little tirade on the\nLondon Underground and Saddam\nHussein ('Prepare to face the mother of\nall gaps, infidel swine...'), Jack and Harry\nfinally made it on stage. Do you\nremember the days when your parents\nwatched 'buddy, buddy' comedians, who\nwere so excruciatingly bad, you ended up\ngoing away to do something (anything)\nelse? These two are supposedly 'failed'\nmembers of this community, brought out\nof retirement, and they 'might be doing\nsome new material, a little bit later on'.\nIt's rather a good parody, but for one\nslight slip up. They're funny. Both their\njibes at these old-times variety acts, and\nmore modern day issues hit the mark\nGrease Most people remember the film\nversion of this play, which started a minor craze in the 70s. The original\nstage play had a harder edge, which has\nbeen successfully transfered to stage.\nChoreographed by a professional actress,\nit carries the audience along in a wave of\nsheer enthusiasm.\nThe amateur cast rose to the challenge\nsuperbly in most cases, and the 'Teen\nAngel' dream sequence is a comic\nmasterpiece. Surely the cheapest musical\nin London at the moment.\nGrease is playing at QM W's Great Hall,\nMile End Road today at 4.00pm and\n8.00pm and tickets cost \u00a32.50 on the\ndoor. A wop bop a loo wop a wop bam\nboom!\nPenny.\nGlasses A night out watching poetry is not\nmany people's idea of a good time.\nBut when the poet is John Hegley,\nit's a different story.\nAfter making his name on the comedy\ncircuit, John Hegley appears on ITV's Friday late night poetry programme and\nregularly in the national press. He is now on tour with guitarist 'Nigel'.\nHis performance was short and sharp,\nconcentrating on mundane aspects of life,\nat the same time as keeping his audience\nin hysterics. The material was delivered\nin the slow, deadpan manner of a suicidal\ndepressive inter spaced with bursts of\nenergy and emotion in the middle of a poem. This, along with verbal attacks on\nthe audience, reduced most people to\nmore often than not.\nThe atmosphere of the venue certainly\nhelped, situated, as it was, above The Old\nCoffee House (a pub). The compactness of\nthe audience, and the regular alcohol\nbreaks (except for me, as I was on\npepsi...) really helped the evening flow.\nDid the audience enjoy themselves, my lo vies? They did. As for the friend (who\ndoes an extended set), he was funny, but\nhe's a different person each week (if you\nsee what I mean), so there's not really\nmuch point reviewing him, is there? Mind\nyou, for his purposes, we were a lousy\naudience...\nFor an intimate, cheap and good\nevening's comedy, you could do a lot\nworse than this. Oranje Boom Boom is\nfound at 49 Beak St, W l. Jack and Harry\netc, is on every Tuesday, with Doors\nopening at 8.30. Student tickets cost\n\u00a32.50. Take your Union card!\nPendragon\ngiggles.\nHe said later you can always add to\nsomething by putting humour in. Most of\nhis poems were written on this basis,\nthey attacked his subjects, in particular\nhis macho brother-in-law who believed\nmen don't drink half pints.\nThe only poem which contained no\nhumour at all was about his father's death. After having made us laugh at the\nway his father used to beat him, which left marks called 'super sunburn', John\nHegley tried to make amends by\ndescribing his father's last hours in a hospital bed. Seeming embarrassed after\nthis he quickly moved on, ignoring a poignant moment in the midst of the\nlaughter.\nSam Krichinsky carne to America in\n1914. Then he came to Baltimore.\nIt was the most beautiful place he\nhad seen in his entire life. He obviously\nhadn't been around much, had he?\nHe joins his brothers. They start a family. The family has its ups and downs.\nHe dies. This has been done before. This\nhas been done better. For example:\nParenthood was funnier, Hope and Glory\nhad more charm and this has\nsentimentality.\nTo give the film its due, it's beautifully\nacted, the cinematography is stunning on\noccasions, and some of the subplots are\nfairly interesting. Barry Levison, the\ndirector, has described it as being derived\nfrom memories of stories told by his\ngrandfather, and it shows. Too much of it\ncomes across as a disjointed series of\nvaguely related incidents. His own\nfeelings seem to have leaked into the\nvery substance of the film, leaving it\nawash with sentimentality, but with very\nlittle of any real substance. This is not a great film.\nPendragon.\nImprovisation in the style of Whose\nLine is it Anyway was tried, with the\naudience calling out subjects as cheese,\nfish and eggs to inspire poetry. Not much\nhumour there I'm afraid.\nThis was certain aly not a standard\npoetry reading, but at \u00a32 for students it\ncan be an entertaining and original\nevening's entertainment.\nThe Poetry Society meets at 21 Earl's Court Road (Earl's Court tube) on\nTuesdays and Thursdays. Speakers in the\nnext weeks include: Gavin Ewart who has\nspoken at Imperial College, Les Murray\nwell known Australian poet and Frank\nDelaney.\nJonty.\n6\n\n"

The question hangs\nbetween you like Damacles' sword. Does\nan inappropriate answer imply doom? Do you answer truthfully about that bar job\nin the Pig and Whistle? Do you lie\noutright? (Well, actually I piloted Richard\nBranson's private hot air balloon). Or do\nyou take the 'truth plus' em bel ish ment path?\nIt's embarrassing isn't it? Why should\nyou have to em bel ish in the first place?\nProbably the Pig and Whistle was all that\nwas available in the last weeks of July,\nwhen you finally resigned yourself to\nlooking for summer work. Isn't there\nanything more rewarding?\nHow about getting a job lined up before\nEaster? Why not be prepared this year;\nset yourself apart from the crowd?\nPerhaps you have aspirations to run your\nown business some day?

(i.e. good for small\ntalk) you may be interested to know a little bit more about my summer work.\nI 've spent the last two summers\nworking in America for the Southwestern\nPublishing Company. In 1989 I was on a sales internship, where Iran my own business, marketing school books. I turned over about $10,000 in the\nsummer. Last summer I was promoted\nand rana five man team as a student\nmanager responsible for $26,000 of\nbusiness. This year I shall be working\nwith other managers and about fifteen\nstudents.\nAs my business has grown, so has my experience and confidence. And not only\ncan I discuss by business interests in the\nUS at cocktail parties\u2014it also makes for\ninteresting conversation with potential\nemployers.\nAfter all, how many other milk round candidates have run their own business\nand made a profit?\nLast summer, the top first year (with\nSouthwestern) made $20,516. The average first year made around $3,500.\nAnd some made no money; that's the real\nworld of business.\nDo you feel above average? Do you want to set yourself apart from your\npeers?

Boring Lectures Column\nGeorge's Diary\nMonday 25 Feb\nWent to see Kindergarten Cop at Fulham\nRoad cinema with Henry. Couple of pints\nin the Goat in Boots first, you just know they won't stay quiet and we both had to\ngo for a piss half way through the film.\nFriday 1st March\nOut with Henry, met a few mates on the\nway. Southside, Union, legless. Tried to\ncome on to a pretty black girl but got put\ndown severely. Henry went back to a mate's house for a smoke. I was feeling\nrandy so decided to call on Nadine, an\nAmerican girl I keep trying to seduce.\nShe didn't seem to mind being knocked\nup at 12.45am. 'Hi, Nadine, it's George.'\n'George, what are you doing here?'\n'I was on my way home from the\nUnion, I just thought I'd call on you. Do you mind\u2014what time is it?..Quarter to\none\u2014sorry. I didn't wake you up did I?' 'No, we're always up. My brother's here, he's s tying till Thursday.' So no sex\ntonight. She promised to phone so I went\nquietly.\nSaturday 2nd Out with Tim and a couple of American girls. One, Melanie, noticed our video,\nTits and Clits. Then the conversation\nmoved to another film and whether John\nHolmes had got his whole cock up some\ngirl. 'It was this long', Melanie insisted,-'and she only took about this much of it!'\n(about a third).\nDidn't go very well with the girls,\ninstead we went for an Indian at the New Asia in Earl's Court. They told us they\nwere closed. Then a couple of guys came\nin behind us and got a table. I complained to the manager. ' How come\nyou let these guys in if you're closed?'\n'They very good friends, live two doors\naway.'\n'Yeah, well I live across the road too,\nand we come in here every week, maybe\ntwo times a week! I tell you we won't be\ncoming in again if you don't serve us\nnow.'\nBut he didn't want our custom, I left\nquietly. That's the last time we go in\nthere though.\n.' . ~\nSunday 3rd Compiled a list of course works and when\nthey were due. I just couldn't face it,\nwent down the pub with Henry for a lunchtime session.\nDear Kylie,\nIam in love with you. Come to my loins my darling, and let us make love.\nHuh, 'I should be so lucky'. Come and 'Step back in time' with me. Please don't leave me with 'tears on my pillow'. Don't worry, I won't hurt you, I mean it's 'better the devil you know' anyway. ' How can 1 prove I really love you, love you' my darling? Let me taste that honeyed\nnutty tang ed zest of yours.\n'Kylie, Kylie,\nYou make me feel all smiley'\nI want to scratch that bloody Hutchence\neyes out. He's no good for you.

    "content": "Alien Sex Fiend and Pendragon meet Dan Abnett, co-writer of one of their favourite comics and ask him about...\nMagic and Dolphins, Heroes and Rainforests...\nDan Abnett is the co-writer (with John\nTomlinson) of 'The Knights of Pendragon'\n(KOP), a monthly comic published by\nMarvel UK. He has also worked on\nseveral other titles for Marvel UK, including being the editor of 'Strip' up\nuntil its recent demise. He has recently\nleft Marvel UK, and now works as an\neditor for 'Apocalypse', a new British\ncompany formed by some of the cream\nof the comics industry in this country. He\nis continuing to write KOP on a freelance\nbasis.\n'The Knights of Pendragon' is set in\nBritain, and has a heavy ecological\ntheme, set against the rich tapestry of\nCeltic and Arthurian myths which abound\nin our country. Its main characters are\npeople chosen as champions by the\nancient forces of these Isles, to fight\nagainst the damage being done to Nature.\nIt is one of the best monthly comics\naround at the moment, and by far one of\nthe best things ever done by Marvel. The\nwriting, plots, character is ation, art and\nmood of the strip are all excellent. As you may of guessed, we like it.\nThus we were more than happy when it turned out that Dan Abnett was to be\none of the guests at last weeks PicoCon.\nAfter his excellent talk about the comics\nfield, Dan was grabbed and forced to sit\nin front of a tape deck while we\ninterviewed him. Throughout both the\ninterview and the rest of the day Mr Abnett was pleasant, humorous,\ninformative and interesting. We only wish\nwe'd had more time in which to talk to\nhim.\nHow long have you been working in\nthe comics field?\nNearly four years.\nHow did you get into the field, and\nwere you an avid reader before that?\nNo. I came into it because I didn't know\nwhat I wanted to do. I used to read\ncomics, when I was very young... 'It all\nstarted' (silly voice, laughs) ...I went to a new school and made a new friend, who also enjoyed drawing.\nOne day I went around to his house,\nand he showed me these things he was\ndrawing, and they were comics. I thought\n'Oooh, that's a good idea', and he showed\nme all these comics. He had huge great\npiles of them, because he collected all the\nBritish weeklies as they came out.\nIt was one of those twists of fate that\nhappen in life: He had too many comics\nto fit into the cupboard he kept them in,\nand his mother had told him he was\ngoing to throw them away unless he found a home for them. So he said to me\n'would you like the comics ?'. So, I took\naway a pile of comics, a big pile about\nthis high (glances at tape deck and says\n'about a foot high' and laughs). I had\nnever read things like this before. There\nwere all the old Hulk stories, Barry\nWindsor-Smith's original Conan stuff, Don Heck's early Avengers, all that kind of\nstuff.\nAnyway, I just went 'Wow, this is\nbrilliant!', because it immediately\nanswered the question ' How can I do the\ntwo things I like most...', which were\nwriting and drawing, '...at the same\ntime?'. So I started drawing my own\ndoing, working for the college magazine,\nalthough it was much more student y and\ncartoon y than this (Felix), and I didn't have much spare time.\nAt the end of it everyone was kind of\ngoing off to this job or that job, and I had\nno idea of what I wanted to do. Someone\nsuggested that I actually try to get a job\nin comics, so I wrote to Marvel, as it was\nthe name that I associated the most with\nthe comics I read, and they asked me to\ngo for an interview, so I thought 'good'\n(laughs), and I went along. It turned out\nthat they'd been advertising for some\ncomics. I started reading 2000 AD,I started reading some US comics, but then\nI got side- tracked: I was too busy, what\nwith 'A' levels and stuff to worry about.\nSo, I went to University, and took\nEnglish. The thing was that both of my parents were art teachers and it was\nalways my strong subject: It was always\naccepted that I would go to art college.\nBut it turned out that I was also quite\ngood at English, and comparatively I was\nbetter at English than I was at Art. So,\nmy English teacher said to me'I think\nyou should do English at University', and\nput me in for Oxbridge, where I eventually went to read English, which I'd never intended to do.\nIt was during that period that I started\nto read comics again. There's a great\ncomic shop in Oxford called 'Rainbows\nEnd'. That was when I read 'The Dark\nKnight Returns' for the first time, and\nagain, it's like one of those crucial\nmoments, and I thought 'This is really\ngood'. However, at the time I was doing\na lot of the kind of thing that you're\neditorial positions, and thought I'd applied\ndue to that. But it became apparent that I was just interested, and I got one of the\njobs.\nWhat was it like starting as an editor\nat Marvel? What did you do?\nWell, as an editor in training at Marvel I spent the first while working in the\ncolour separation department. Then I became an assistant editor, just doing the\nbasic paste-up, and then you start to\nwrite a bit of copy, and you just learn\neach stage as you go along, and work\nyour way through. They always, I think,\nlike you to write a script, because how\ncan you possibly criticise somebody else's scripting, unless you can do it? Maybe not\nas well as them, but as long as you\nunderstand the principles.\nReally, it's on the job training whatever\nyou do, because comics are such a funny\nthing, and a lot of the things you\nprobably think you know about comics\nare probably completely wrong. A lot of\nthe things I thought I knew about them\nwere completely wrong.\nIt's great though. I mean I really, really\nenjoy writing. There's nothing better than\nsitting down and thinking 'I 've got a whole issue of Pendragon to write! God!'\nHow did you come up with the\noriginal idea for KOP?\nIt came about via myself and Steve\nWhite. Steve as an editor had a slot for a new comic, and we tend to collaborate\non stuff, so we were talking about things,\nuse Dai Thomas, who was attached to\nCaptain Britain, and make him the link\nacross, and the main character for the\ninitial stretch.\nHow much research did you do on the\nCeltic and Arthurian background that\nis central to the story? It seems very\ncomprehensive.\nWe certainly have read several books on\nthe subject, put it that way. Part of my English course at university was Middle\nEnglish and Mallory. The Arthurian\nas it was obvious that he was going to\nedit it. He was talking to me not\nnecessarily as the writer, but just for\nideas. We talked about the idea of doing\nan ecologically orientated comic, with the\naim of increasing peoples awareness. It\nwas sort of na ff, but it seemed\nappropriate.\nWe had this idea, which we thought\nwas very strong, about a guy who is\nmotivated by forces that he doesn't understand to go out and do' something\nabout it, and maybe develop that in a more supernatural way. Simultaneously\nthe Americans suggested the possibility of\nus using Captain Britain, because he was\nbecoming very popular in Excalibur at\nthe time. Anyway, in the process of\ntalking, the two ideas fused.\nWe realised that Captain Britain\ncouldn't be the character it happens to,\nbecause that would be far too much on\nhis shoulders, so we had this other\ncharacter, who would get involved with\nCaptain Britain, and he would be the guy\nthat changed. The obvious thing was to\nLegend is one of my favourite stories,\nand so I'm quite glad that we've found a new way to look at it. In the end we just\npicked one version and stuck to it.\nAfter we fused the two ideas I was\nthere because of my knowledge of the\nArthurian Stuff, and Steve has a very\nstrong ecological background, and John\nwas assistant editor on Captain Britain\nand knows a lot of that background. In\nfact, it's amusing to reflect, at this\njuncture, that the brains behind KOP are\nSteve White, who's the senior Marvel\neditor, Me, who'snow( laughs) a senior\nApocalypse person, and John Tomlinson,\nwho most weeks is the mighty Tharg (the\neditor of 2000 AD), so there's an\ninteresting combination (laughs)\nSeveral Marvel titles seem to be\ngetting much darker, KOP also seems\nto be a part of this more mature\napproach...\nYes, it's something I 've been working\ntowards for a long time, along with (but\nindependant ly of) several other writers.\nAnother one of the strengths of KOP is the humour...\nI think humour is extremely important in\ncomics, I hate those totally serious ones.\nWe like to put in some on-liners every\nnow and then.\nWell, they're excellent. We're also\nimpressed that one of the characters\nlives on Gloucester Road! It adds to\nthe realism of the story when you use\nreal places.\nYes. We based it all on real places. I live\nin Kent, so that was where the Kent link\ncame in, Gary Erskine is a Scottish artist,\nso the Scottish link is there. Gloucester\nRoad seemed like a likely place for Kate\nto live. The only times we do take\nliberties by actually inventing places tend\nto be like the Orkney Islands bit: There\nisn't actually a place called that, because\nwe didn't want to say 'This place is full of\nmurderers', it was just the concept.\nSimilarly the Spanish town, although, now I come to say it, that was John's idea, so\nmaybe it is real!\nCertainly the myths that connect to the\nstory are real ones. We either use real\nnames and places, or transpose real\nplaces to different locations. We only\ninvent a name when we think that using\nthe real name would be too pointed or\ndamaging to the place concerned.\nI do like the way Captain Britain has\nbeen portrayed in KOP, especially his\nrelationship with Union Jack.\nYes, we really wanted to contrast the two\ncharacters. Captain Britain is so much like\nCaptain America, you know, he's so\nhonorable it's annoying, and Union Jack\nis much more the sort of DareDevil or\nSpiderman Character, anything for a quick laugh, but deep down motivated by\nexactly the same sense of justice.\nBut we did get into a lot of trouble with\nthe things that Captain Britain does in the\nstrip. Alan Davis said that Captain Britain\nwould never have killed Dai. We have\nsince made a gentleman's agreement,\nwhereby we agreed that by that stage\nDai Thomas IS Sir Gawain anyway, and\nhe's fulfilling a role, and when Captain\nBritain arrives he's fulfilling a role as\nwell, and becomes the character of\nLancelot in the original story.\nAt this point Mr Abnett was grabbed by\nthe PicoCon organisers, and shortly\nafterwards had to leave. Felix would like\nto thank him for this interview, and the\nopenness and geniality he showed\nthroughout.\n12 13\n\n"

    "content": "Boss Hog This was not a gig for the faint hearted,\nnor was it for music lovers. God saw to\nthat. Even Gallon Drunk had a strange\nquirk. They emerged quaint rockabilly\ntypes but soon proved that first\nimpressions can be very deceptive. The\nry th m section were quite normal,\nincluding the maracas. They played notes,\nOcean\nColour Scene\n\u2014The Venue 1.3.91\nNot being very well up on the\n'Manchester' scene, I assumed that Ocean\nColour Scene were catching a free ride\non its sodden coat tails. Seeing the\noccasional fan in the annoyingly designed\nT shirts didn't help much either. So when\nthey modestly took to the stage and\nplugged in I was taken aback. First off,\nthey aren't an archetypal northern band.\nSecondly, the lead singer IS the new Mick\nJagger. He doesn't sound like him\nparticularly, but yes, he has the sneer,\nthe arrogant look and the silly epileptic\ndance. They don't stop there either. It\ndoesn't take long to see they are under\nthe Beatle's influence - in fact its more\nalong the lines of inebriation. Still,\nfollowing in these well worn footsteps has\npaid off well. They've brought the\ncombination bang up to date and produce\nsome excitingly fresh and sparkling ly, shiny songs. Just watching from the\nbalcony, I could see this band have the\nundefinable magic quality that could see\nthem heading in a upward direction.\nDefinitely ones to watch. This gig was\nfilmed and Ocean Colour Scene can be\nseen on Snub TV on Monday.\nHarry Cross.\n\u2014Marquee\neven in time with each other. It became\ninteresting when the lead singer dropped\nthe guitar (literally) and began playing\nkeyboards as well as singing. Juggling the\nvocals, the guitar and the keyboard\nproved difficult and some anarchic results\noccurred. Good for a laugh.\nGod were different; any band with two\ndrummers, two bassists and two guitarists\n(let alone two saxophonists) was to be\ndifferent. The ensuing noise carnage was\ninspiring. The only clear effects were a driving beat (a well cool one at that) and\na non-stop wall of sound. Vocals\nscreamed over the top, repetitive to the\nextreme. The first song had one word \u2014\n'God'\u2014it lasted fifteen minutes. After two\nor three more pure noise sessions the\nMarquee was lost in the haze, you could\nonly sit back and take it.\nThe gold lame shirt and Ching guitar\nsignified the arrival of the Pussy Galore\ninspired Boss Hog experience. After an\nindeterminable time the 'Goddess of\nlatter day noise rock arrived on stage,\ninspiring a new wave of audience\nparticipation\u2014positive this time. The\nlurching romping and grinding roll began\nas Boss Hog cruised through the back\ncatalogue of sleaze d rockabilly-inspired\nthrash.\nLike a bass hungry Pussy Galore, Boss\nHog, spewed out their strange brew.\nGood drinking it was.\nSeb.\nJesus Jones\nJust fifteen months ago, London-based\n'techno-terrorists' Jesus Jones released\ntheir first album, Liquidiser, on the back\nof the swift rise of the 'Indie' music scene.\nOnly fifteen months later, the Jones'\nplayed two dates at Kentish Town'sT& C, accompanied by such publicity (hype?)\nthat touts were looking for \u00a335 per ticket\n(\u00a37 face value) on the night of the gig.\nStarting the show for Jesus Jones were\nSoho, a former club act currently\nenjoying the success of Hippychick (spot\nthe Smith's How Soon is Now guitar\nsample) and promoting their second\nalbum, Goddess, before a tour including a date at the Astoria (24.5). They were\nenjoyable enough for a support band, but\ngave too stilted a performance to be\nsatisfying, only relaxing into their simple,\ncatchy tunes towards the end of their set.\nThey didn't go down too well with the JJ\nfans, though.\nLights go out, and down come the\nback cloths for JJ's set, depicting the\nclowns heads which are the theme of the\nDoubt tour: the crowd go manic. That\nLevitation\n& Catherine Wheel\n\u2014Underworld 2.3.91\nThese two bands are booked to play I.C at the end of term, so I decided to get\nmyself over to Camden and see what's in\nstore for you lucky boys and girls. Just\nbefore I review the gig, it must be said\nfull marks to those lovely Underworld\npeople - the beer came in glasses! Ha ha,\nI was armed and waiting. So were\nCatherine Wheel. Ride comparisons\nabound and so did I as the lead singer\n(strangely wearing the same top as the\nprevious nights O.C.S singer) launched\ninto some acutely devastating guitar\nsongs. Treading through an almost classic\npop genre they played a wonderfully fluid\nset with ease and confidence.\nThe headlining act went to Levitation.\nWere they some kind of Spacemen 31\nHad Bickers gone bonkers? Nobody\nseemed to know. As the band came on, a cautious audience moved toward the\nstage. Nobody pushed, rushed or shouted.\nVery odd. House of Love they were not.\nSo what were they ? In essence they\nlacked focus - were they pop or sub-pop?\nI don't think they knew themselves.\nBickers seemed to have a great time with\nhis guitar and pedals, and he was\noblivious to the stilted response from the\ncrowd. This was a gig where it was\nobviously more fun on the stage than off.\nHarry Cross\n& Soho\n-T&C mania continues through the one hour\nand ten minute set, opening with the\nmarginally 'baggy' style including Right\nHere, Right Now, International Bright\nYoung Thing and Real, Real.\n'People say we're just a pop band' say\nthe band after IBYT, and launch into\ntheir more familiar stuttering wall of\nsound with Trust Me, Stipped and Two\nand Two. Mike Edwards' guitar sound,\ndrenched with echo and ADT, drove the\ncrowd into a frenzy, breaking only with\nthe quiet deadpan rap vocal and low-key\nmoody backdrop of the likes of Nothing\nto Hold Me.\nAs an encore, Jesus proclaimed 'We're\ngoing out of here the same way you will\nbe!' and hit an exhausted crowd with the\nan the mic Pissed. Pissed, exhausted and\nexhilarated, we made our way home after\none of a very enjoyable gig. Just over\none hour may seem short for a set, but\nwith Jesus Jones, it's density that counts\nand not length.\nGraeme H.15 "

    "content": "and Societies\nSplot Soc\nSaturday February 23 saw the inaugural\nUniversities tournament at ProSport, near\nEffingham Junction. The Imperial team,\nknown loosely as Emulsion Propulsion,\nXenomorphs, Eggshell-Finished Death\n(and a multitude of other, more insulting\nnames) entered their first own-guns\ntourney.\nHot favourites to win were Kingston\nPoly (the Black Legion, apparently) and\nthe Anchovies (from Essex Uni). Other\nparticipants included Reading, South Bank\nPoly and UCL( more about them later).\nThe format was a round-robin, with the\ntop four teams playing off in semi- and\nfinal games to deter in e the placings, with\nthe bottom two teams playing to avoid\nbeing laughed at.\nFirst up against us were the Black\nLegion, having first complained about the\npaint (purple, toxic and it hurts\u2014just the\nway we planned it...) we were throwing.\nBoth sides were unduly cautious, the\nresult ending in a draw. Having sorted\nout our tactics (a cocktail of blitzkrieg,\nNew York Giant-style offensive play, blind\nluck and lots of shouting thrown in), we\nproceeded to shred the remaining\nopposition in grand style. A hugely\nhonourable mention goes to Reading who\nput up a good fight with only ten men,\nand not-so-honourable rr rent ion to South\n\"Bank Poly, who lasted a magnificent four\nand a half minutes.\nPenalties flew thick and fast, with\npoints deducted for anything from hot\nguns to interesting language. The result of\nthe round-robin phase saw Emulsion\nPropulsion in first place, playing off\nagainst Reading in the first semi-final. The\nother semi-final saw the much-vaunted\n(and now deep purple) Black Legion\nagainst UCL. Kingston suffered a shc ok loss to UCL, while Imperial pulled off another\ncomprehensive victory against Reading.\nWe therefore faced UCL for the trophy (a case of Tennants). Managing to snatch a defeat from the jaws of victory, Imperial\nsuffered their first loss of the day in a blaze of glory, smoke (ours) and suicidal\ntactics. All credit to a canny UCL team\nwho sat back and watched us shred\nourselves\u2014at least, Kingston didn't win\n(boy, were they pissed off), and the\nUniversities of London carried off the top\ntwo places.\nFilm Soc\nThe final presentation of the term by\nFilmSoc is another classic. The film is by\nthe supreme master of suspense\u2014Alfred\nHitchcock. It starts the irrepressible James\nStewart and the stunningly beautiful\nGrace Kelly. Stewart has been consigned\nto his room due to a broken leg, and to\nalleviate the boredom he resorts to\nobserving the day to day life of the\nresidents in the block of flats opposite his\nbedroom window. One night he becomes\nthe sole witness to a murder (or does\nhe?). No one else of course believes him,\nexcept his girlfriend, and so the two\nattempt to resolve the mystery by\nthemselves. The performances are\nimmaculate and the direction faultless.\nThe show starts at 7.30pm in Me ch Eng\n220, Thursday March14. OSC\nInternational Night\nAfter a very successful event and before\nreturning to my piling-up coursework, I feel I should write a few impressions\nabout the International Night '91. The\nmassive effort of countless students and\nmost national societies was well justified\nin probably the colourful event of the\nyear.\nFrom the organisational point of view it\nall went quite well. The main problem\nwas the huge crowd queueing outside the\nentrance and trying to get into the\nalready full J CR and Great Hall without\nhaving tickets. Fortunately we finally\nmanaged to cope with it. To our\ndisappointed visitors I can only suggest\nthat they buy their tickets earlier next\ntime (maybe next year'sO SC will\nconsider using the Albert Hall!).\nOtherwise, we had few unexpected\nproblems and even fewer complaints,\nmany of which were unjustified. The vast\nmajority of people had a wonderful time.\nNewspapers in Haldane Library\nAfter popular demand, in the beginning\nof this year we negotiated with the\nHaldane Library and we arranged the\ndisplay of foreign newspapers for the\nbenefit of the overseas students. We compiled a list of twenty or so\nnewspapers that societies were interested\nto subscribe to. However, only a few\nnewspapers are displayed in the Haldane\nLibrary. This is very embarrassing\nbecause we insisted that papers should be\ndisplayed, and the library staff kindly\naccepted them despite the trouble that\nthey had had in the past. What\nhappened? Didn't the societies bother\nsubscribing? I suggest that overseas\nstudents start hassling their societies\nabout that.\nSabbatical Elections\nI believe that overseas students can get\nmuch more out of the Union and its\nsabbaticals in the following years by\nvoting in the elections. There are at least\n1,200 overseas students with a right to\nvote in this college; this number can\nsignificantly influence the outcome of\nthese elections. In this way, the overseas\nstudents can get commitments from the\ncompeting candidates to promote their\ncollective interest.\nAGM The Annual General Meeting of the\nOverseas Students Committee is going to\ntake place on Thursday March14 at\n12.30pm in room342 Me ch Eng. In this\nmeeting, we will have elections for the\nfollowing positions: Chairman, Vice\nChairman, Junior Treasurer, Honorary\nSecretary, Events Officer, Publicity\nOfficer, Sports Officer, Welfare Officer,\nLiaison Officer and seven Ordinary\nMembers. Anyone who wishes to stand\nfor these positions can sign up at the OSC\nnoticeboard (no 15) in the main walkway.\nThe job descriptions will be displayed at\nthis board.\nFor those who don't already know, the\nOSC is a major subcommittee of the\nStudents' Union with the following\nactivities: it represents overseas students\nin Union committees, the Union Council,\nsome College committees and other\nbodies. It provides a forum for discussion\nof problems and other issues concerning\noverseas students. It coordinates the\nfunction of national societies. It acts as a buffer between these societies and the\nStudents' Union. It organises events.\nGenerally the OSC keeps a low-profile\namong students. If anyone wants more\ninformation, please contact me, Andreas\nMassouras, through my union pigeonhole.\n17\n\n"

    "content": "All's Fair...?\nDear Andy,\nPresident Bush has said that the war\nagainst Iraq was fought for the 'liberation\nof Kuwait', but what exactly does the\n'liberation of Kuwait' actually mean? It\nseems to me that Kuwait, was in part\n'liberated' for the benefit of the people\nliving in Kuwait, so that, in some sense, it\nwas not Kuwait but a group of people\nthat were 'liberated'. But which people?\nWas it the Kuwaiti nationals who were\n'liberated'? The Emir is imposing three\nmonths of martial law on Kuwait\n(presumably because, as according to the\nInterior Minister, 'the cleansing of Kuwait\nfrom the effects of war and from the fifth\ncolumns'...will require some time' (my\nitalics) and Kuwaiti opposition groups are\nforced to have a conference outside their\ncountry, because such a conference is\nforbidden under martial law. Already\nmembers of the Kuwaiti opposition in\nKuwait have been assassinated and,\naccording to senior members of the\nopposition, the Planning Minister had said\nthat Syria's disbanded Special Forces\nwere being recruited by a young Sabah\nto 'eliminate opposition'. Indeed, Kuwaitis\nseem to have more liberty here in Britain\nthan they do in their own country.\nWas it the people who worked in\nKuwait who were 'liberated'? The\nWashington based Centre of Policy\nAnalysis on Palestine has already called\nfor measures to prevent retaliation\nagainst Palestinians living in Kuwait,\npeople who have contributed more to the\ngrowth of Kuwait than the Kuwaitis\nthemselves. One of the reasons for the\nCentre's concern is that the Crown Prince\nSheikh Sa'ad as-Sabah himself had said\nthat they will begin checking up on the\nPalestinians and non-Palestinians who\nmight have been in the 'fifth column'\n(certainly any 'retaliations' on the\nPalestinians carried out by the state\nwould be much easier under martial law).\nSo it does not seem likely that the war\nwas fought for the large group of non-Kuwaitis living in Kuwait.\nWas the war, in some twisted way,\nfought for the 'liberation' of (he Iraqi\npeople? Liberty in Iraq was not taken\nvery seriously by the US when for over\ntwenty years it allowed, supported and\nprobably helped set up the brutal Ba'ath\nregime, a regime which imprisoned,\ntortured and killed thousands of innocent\nArabs and Kurds in Iraq. And the\nthousands of people who are not trapped\nin rubble, who are suffering from disease,\nand who are being operated on without\nanaesthetic because their country has\nbeen 'bombed back into the stone-age',\ncan hardly feel 'liberated'. The Iraqi\nconscripts, who probably never wanted\nthe war and were bombed even while\nretreating because they were a 'threat'\ncould hardly have felt that they are being\n'liberated', and now that the US, a country which has imposed many\ndictatorships across the world, is poised\nto impose yet another dictatorship on\nIraq, it seems very unlikely that the war\nwas fought for the 'liberation' of the Iraqi\npeople.\nThe Kuwaiti nationals have not gained\nas much 'liberation' as they would have\nliked, nor have the non-Kuwaitis in\nKuwait, and certainly not the people of\nIraq. Who then, was 'liberated' in this\nwar? Well for a start there is the ruling\nfamily of Kuwait, Israel hasn't done too\nbadly, and the US has certainly made\ngains in this war. The war was fought so\nthat the Sabah family could have the\nfreedom to exploit the people in Kuwait\nand to make mind-numbing ly large\namounts of money, so that Israel no\nlonger had to deal with the 'threat' of\nIraq, and now that it is once again the\nstrongest state in the Middle East, could\ntake extra 'liberty' in suppressing the\nPalestinian 'threat', and last and by no\nmeans least, so that the ruling powers of\nthe US could have the freedom to exploit\nthe Middle East.\nI fully condemn the invasion of Kuwait\nby Saddam, and whatever legitimate\nrights Iraq has to Kuwait, invasion and\nslaughter of innocent people by a dictator\nis wrong. But I would lie to make an\neven stronger condemnation of the US for\nencouraging Kuwait to 'stand firm' and\nnot to negotiate with Iraq on the\neconomic problems and border disputes\nwhich led to the invasion, while at the\nsame time giving a 'green light' to\nSaddam to invade Kuwait, thereby giving\na pretext for the US to de story Iraq.\nYasir Hassan, Physics 1.\nIndustrial Society\nArthur Andersen& Co Business Game at Head Offices\nWednesday13 March2.00 pm \u00a33 deposit cheque payable to\nICU/SCC (returnable) send to\nTim Taubman, Civ Eng II for\ndetails\nLETTERS\nWhat'sOn AN UP-TO-THE-MINUTE GUIDE TO EVENTS\nSouthside Gym.\nIntermediate Rock n' Roll 6.00pm JCR.\nSwimming 6.30pm Sports Centre.

    "content": "Access Rent Scandal\nStudents should start receiving money\nfrom the Access Fund soon. The fund\nstands at over a quarter of a million\npounds. Mr Cullen, in overall charge of\nmoney distribution, has processed all\napplications from undergraduates living in\nhall or in college accommodation.\nTomorrow he will make the first request\nfor appropriate cheques to be issued by\nthe college finance section.\nMr Cullen intends to process the\nremaining applications, two thirds of the\nfive hundred total, by the end of term.\nThe first cheques, according to Mr Cullen,\nwill be issued within the week.\nGarden\nFire\nThe Fire Brigade were called out to\nGarden Hall, last Monday, when a fire\nwas reported in one of the kitchen areas.\nAt about 10.30am,a microwave, which\nwas not being used at the time, burst into\nflames.\nThe housekeeper, Margaret Gaskin,\nimmediately left her office in Weeks Hall\nand extinguished the fire. Soon\nafterwards, three fire engines arrived, but\nwere not required. Despite alarms, the\nhall was not completely evacuated.\nThe recently refitted kitchen will now\nhave to be redecorated again. The\nassistant Warden, Dr. Ian Metcalfe, said\nthat there had been a 'fair amount of\ndamage'.\nAnti-War\nJeremy Corben, Labour MP, spoke at an\nanti-war meeting at Imperial on Tuesday.\nThe meeting was organised by Imperial\nCollege Anti-War Society.\nForty students listened to Mr Corben as\nhe outlined both his thoughts' on the Gulf\nWar and the recent cease-fire. Mr Corben\nfelt that it was likely the peace\nmovement would be fighting for the\nwithdrawal of troops a year from now.\nMr Corben answered students' questions\nincluding why he remained a Labour\nmember since he was diametrically\nopposed to his leadership's stance on the\nGulf. Mr Corben replied that if'he\nresigned it would reduce yet further\nParliamentary 'opposition' to the war.\nA student who attended the meeting\ndescribed the ensuing discussion on many\naspects of the conflict as 'constructive'.\nResidents of many of the college halls will\nhave to pay full rent over the Easter\nvacation, or empty their rooms. Last year\nstudents were charged only a week's rent\nto be able to leave belongings in their\nrooms. Halls affected are Southside,\nLinstead, Beit , Garden, Weeks and\nEvelyn Gardens.\nThe wardens were not consulted or\nforewarned about this dramatic change in\ncollege accommodation policy. Whether\nthe decision was taken by the college\naccommodation or by a separate college\ndepartment is unclear at the moment.\nSpanner and Bolt, the City and Guilds\nCollege Union mascots, have been taken\nby two members of the Royal College Of\nScience Union. The mascots were present\nfor the C& GU40th Annual Engineers' Ball\nat the Park Lane Hotel.\nGuilds mascot bearers, Tim NewtonSmith and Karl Edwin, had left Spanner\nand Bolt with Hotel Staff under the\nassurance that they would be totally safe.\nWith an unusual display of cunning, two\nmembers of RCS Mascotry approached\nthe security desk at the Park Lane Hotel,\nand claimed that they were Guilds, and\nwanted to pick up their mascots.\nAfter receiving the mascots they were\nable to leave the hotel seemingly\nunchallenged.\nThe college authorities have made the\nLinstead basement available for storage of\nstudents possessions. The pre-paid\ninsurance only covers loss up to \u00a3150 and\nfor increased cover students would have\nto pay their own premium.\nOne Linstead resident said 'I don't think\nI should be penal is ed for the sake of\ncollege making a fast buck'. Union\nPresident, Paul Shanley, advised students\n'not to make arrangements to move out\nuntil the situation has been clarified by\nofficials within the accommodation\nsector.'\nSpurred on by their recent success the\nRoyal College Of Science Union mascot ry team yesterday acquired the UCL mascot,\n'Phineas MacLino', a six foot tall,\nunattractive, Highlander. Many people\nwere involved, mainly due to the interest\ngenerated by the events of the previous\nweekend.\nC& GU were philosophical about their loss.\n'It has got its plus sides; it is potentially a good opportunity to raise money and to\nget more Freshers involved'. UCL were\nunam used by yesterday's incident; one\nUCL student stated that there had been\nno mascot ry activity at UCL for the last\ntwenty years.

    "content": "Last term Audio Soc's obscurity came to an end and they became.\nFEATURES\nHi-Fi Hipsters\nSomewhere in the deep and distant past\nthat was last term a light flickered at the\nend of Audiosoc's tunnel of obscurity. It\nwas nothing less than a call from a soon-to-be-quit e famous-indeed (we hope!)\nmagazine calling itself 'Hi-Fi World'.\nFeeling that their magazine needed\nsomething just short of sensational for its\nfirst issue they had decided to contact\nICU AudioSoc in the hope that we could\nfind one day in our busy and hectic (?)\nlives to help in the writing of an article\non 'student hi-fi systems'. The idea was to\nchoose some cool and trendy students\n(then why choose IC?) to give the article\nsome real street-cred.O n hearing this momentous news\nMalcolm (Chairman and the main hero of\nour story) along with Richard (creative\naccountant cum treasurer and somewhat\nless of a hero) went into the Union to\nquaff an ale or three (between them of\ncourse) to celebrate the fact that they\nwould soon be mega stars before realising\nthat most people wouldn't give a toss.\nThe deputy editor had asked for five\npeople including a girl (!?) to help with\nthe article. Needless to say this was the\nsource of much amusement for our two\nheroes. However, as luck would have it,\nRichard managed to persuade a first year\nmathematician to join at Freshers' Fair.\nYou would have too if he'd threatened\nyou with a conversation on how the\nturbo-charged tractors on his farm are\nused for target practice by A10 tank busters. Meanwhile, back at the plot, the team\nwas completed by the addition of Mike\nand Darren. So, one cold and wet\nDecember morning our heroes and the\nother three met in a cul-de-sac in Maida\nVale, where they found the offices of said\nmagazine (actually the editor's house).\nThey were all ushered into the living\nroom, or in hi-fi jargon the 'listening\nroom'. The five were given a pen and\npaper each and asked to write down their\nopinions on the five systems placed\nbefore them.\nLittle did our friendly hi-fi journalist\nknow but no one had a clue of what\nfancy reviewing terms such as 'mid band colouration' or 'top-end smearing' meant.\nFortunately, they were not found out, but\nRich nearly blew it by expressing his\nopinion had a 'logarithmic' bass frequency\nroll off( trust a physicist!). However, far\nfrom becoming suspicious, the hi-fi\njournalist was deeply impressed with such\nsuccinct reviewing, which just goes to\nshow what a good bulls hitter he is (yep,\ndefinitely a physicist). Despite this, the\nfive were very impressed with sound\nquality of all the systems presented to\nthem.\nAfter the reviewing was over it was\nphoto time, where everyone was asked to\nstrike a unique (read silly) pose with their\nsystem. After suitably embarrassing\nthemselves (see pic cy) they all went home\nto await the results.\nWell, the magazine is now out, it's the\nMarch edition, costs \u00a32.80 and includes a free CD. When the magazine warned they would\nuse some 'journalistic licence' in writing\nthe article they weren't wrong, but at\nleast its not libellous!\nMeanwhile AudioSoc carries on,\noffering cheap records, tapes and CDs to\nits members (some catalogues are in the\nHaldane Library provided no one has\nnicked them) as well as discounts on all\nthe hi-fi you can buy from those oh-so-nice people at the Cornflake Shop, which\nis situated in Windmill Street, just off\nTottenham Court Road. It's run by two\nex-IC students who open their doors to\nthe public at 10am Monday to Saturday\nas they still haven't got out of the habit\nof missing every 9.30am start. Why did\nthey name it after a breakfast cereal?\nEr...\nAudioSoc also organises trips and\ndemos by manufacturers. Forthcoming\nattractions include a trip to Arc am on\nMarch 13, a trip to Roksan on Wednesday\nMarch 20, and a possible demo by Linn\nsupremo Ivor Tietenbrum in the near\nfuture.

    "content": "The Godfather part III\nThis is a very depressing film. It is\ndepressingly bad. That's a little\nharsh perhaps\u2014what should be said\nis that this part never matches the power\nof the two previous Godfathers.\nMichael Corleone (The Godfather) is\nnow old and slightly haggard, he is a very different man from the confident\nand increasingly ruthless megalomaniac\nof the past. The plot is still concerned\nwith the legit imi sing of the family\nbusiness, as in the second film. Somehow\nMichael must drag the family and, more\nimportantly, himself, out of the mire of\nviolence, crime and corruption that is\ntheir past. Whereas in the second film\nMichael is unable to stop the destruction\nof his personal world through his own\nactions, he is at last able to understand\nthe chaos he has created around himself.\nThe question Coppola (the director)\npresumably wants the audience to ask\nthemselves is whether Michael Corleone\nwill do it? Can Michael escape from his\nown history, to carve out a new\nexistence? Michael's redemption (this is a man, remember, who went so far that\neven the murder of his own brother,\npoor, pitiful Fredo, seemed like a natural\nprogression) lies in his ability to\nacknowledge his past and then 'sin no\nmore'. 'What betrayed me? My mind, or\nmy heart?' he asks in desperation.\nAl Pacino leads the role of Michael\nCorleone. His part lacks the beautiful\nserenity that characterised his roles in the\nprevious films, and has developed a Brandoesque hoarseness in his voice\nPacific Heights\nPacific Heights, a desirable area of\nVictorian residencies in San\nFrancisco, gains two new residents,\nthese being Patty Palmer (Melanie\nGriffith) and Drake Goodman (Matthew\nModine), who renovate their home and\nwish to rent out various rooms to possible\ntenants. The scene is set for John\nSchlesinger's new psychological thriller. In\ncomes Carter Hayes (Michael Keaton) as a smooth and apparently rich prospective\nrent ee, who appears to be every\nlandlord's dream (and the first nail is\ndriven in). Before you can say 'But he\nwas such a nice blok e in Batman' he's in\nthe room with all the locks changed and\nnot budging for neither love nor money.\nWhat's to do? He's signed no papers or\npaid money but has tenant's rights just\nfor being in the house. An eviction order\ntakes time and they just don't know what\nhe's up to (plenty of sawing and banging).\nKeaton lays out subtle ploys and legal\ntraps that Modine springs with an\nignorant persistence that grates. Only the\nsmarter Griffith seems able to see what\nthe very naughty resident is up to, but\nshe always seems at most risk from: his\nlurking.\nThe battle for the house is an addictive\nbase for a story that grows at an\nexponential rate that you know will end\nin tears for one party or the other. As a psychological thriller it fails to give any\nreal unnerving qualities (with the\nexception of an excellent scene where\nKeaton watches static on the T.V. and\nplays alternatively with a Cockroach,\nrazor-blade and pussy-cat). Keaton's performance is the most outstanding point\nof the film, portraying a character who\nmay be suave, deadly, calculated or\nmurderous. A nice point is Tippi Hedren,\nMelanie Griffith's mother, turning up as\nthe rich Florence Peters who Keaton\nattempts to con.\nKeaton is an evil g it, Griffith is a smart\ng it and Modine is just a plain git.A little\ntoo mainstream to get any real\npsychological tension but a good attempt.\nA good film that could do for renting\nwhat Fatal Attraction did for shagging\nGlen Close.\nYours, The Amazing McHine\n(presumably to give the Godfather some\nstature). There seems to have been much criticism of Coppola's decision to cast his\ndaughter, Sofia, in the part of Michael's daughter, Mary. However she seems to\nlend some charm to the film with her\nskew smile and 'unconventional'\n(Hollywood parlance for non-model)\nlooks. Andy Garcia plays the bastard\nnephew, who is only too keen to carry\nthe torch of violence on Michael's behalf.\nCoppola also leads an attack on the\nVatican, implicating the church with the\nbusiness world of the mafia. At times the\npoint is a little labour ed, and the crude\nskulduggery rather hard to swallow\u2014the\nVatican has much more subtle means of\n'persuasion'.\nFrancis Ford Coppola seems to have\nlost his creative juices in the making of\nthis film. Somehow he pulled it off\nbrilliantly in Part II, but one feels that he\nrache d his limit in the first sequel and\nthat there wasn't really a story for the\nthird\u2014this film relies on the success of\nthe past, without itself being creative.\nThis will very likely be a profound\ndisappointment for most viewers.\nI.H. Duck Tales\n\u2014 The Movie It's Donald's mean old Uncle\nScrooge with his band of\nresourceful nephews and singularly\ncute niece out to accumulate themselves\na tidy bundle of treasure and do sh. This\ntakes them out into the desert in search\nof the trez of Colly Baba which Scrooge\nhas been after for forty years. Throw in a magic lamp with a free genie in issue one\nadd a soup con of big bad wizard who can\nchange into any animal that looks mean\nand has a bad rep among children, and\nthat Walt Disney butt kicking action is\nready to roll. The genie is quite naturally\na nice little kid who gets up to wacky\njapes and only wants to be real and he\nmakes friends with the kid de roos. It's mind numbing ly obvious what happens,\nwhich makes it damn good fun. The\ntreasure bits are taken straight from\nRaiders of the Lost Ark and the rest from\nthe Radion advert.\nIn the good old days (relative\nchrono graph y as opposed to BBC music\nhall prog) the misers always got theirs in\nthe end but in todays enlightened\ncapitalist state they can keep the cash\nand get a bit more provided they give a painful enough moral nugget for the kids\nto barf on. Nice to see Donald's speech\nimpediment isn't genetic and the lack of a zany pelican chasing the duck family\ncame as a relief. Disney fun for the fluffy\nst on kers amongst you.\nThe 'Mazin' Mac'\n\n"
