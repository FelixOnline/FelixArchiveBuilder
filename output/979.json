    "content": "10 Feature\nDangerously Close To A Winner?\nMichael Winner (Director) and Lia Williams (Bella) discussing the filming of Dirty Weekend on location in Brighton.\n\"I'm a cross between a sort of jolly holiday\ncamp host and Hitler. Leadership sometimes\ncalls for tough action.\"\nThis seems like exactly the sort of comment\nyou would expect from Michael Winner.\nRenegade restaurant critic, sometime journalist,\nrobust supporter of law and order, this darling of\nthe tabloid press seems to relish the limelight.\nSo, a half hour with him can seem like a long\ntime to a young boy reporter such as myself. The\nfact that he is also a film director at times seems\nto get lost in the hype. Yet his latest controversy,\nDirty Weekend, is his twenty eighth feature\nwithout the words Death Wish in the title.\nThe story of Bella, fed up with men's abuse\nand fighting back with a vengeance to match\nFreddie Kreuger, is bizarre and engaging. But\nmore bizarre is that fact that Michael Winner,\nwho everybody had been warning me about for\nweeks, turned out to be one of the nicest blok es I 've ever talked to. Here are some extracts from\nour chat:\nYour films are often criticised for being\novertly violent? Do you think our censors are\nstricter than those in America?\n\"Oh they're much stricter. The British tend to\nbe a little looser on sex but much tighter on\nviolence. It's very common for American films\nto be substantially cut when they play here.\"\nPeople will inevitably compare Dirty\nWeekend to Death Wish. How do you think\ntimes have changed?\n\"I think Dirty Weekend is a more serious\nfilm. It says if you persecute any minority\nenough they will come out fighting with\ndisproportionate force. Times have changed\nbecause mugging is common now and it wasn't in 1974. The things which are put upon women\nnowadays are all around us. It is a story which\nshows very clearly that women are badly treated\nin all sorts of ways.\"\nWhat do you think of Hollywood revisionism\nabout violence?\n\"Well, what they are saying is that in very big\nfilms that cost $30m, or even $60m$70m, it\ncan't have an 18 certificate. The American\ncinema will go where the money is. I don't think\nthere's a mass movement towards non-violence.\"\nDo you feel there is a parallel with what\nThelma does to the rapist in Thelma and Louise?\n\"That was a far lighter picture, they only\nkilled one person and after that they were nice to\neverybody. When they locked the man in the\ntrunk they made sure he had air. Bella would\nhave killed the lot of them.\"\nDo you think the kind of direct action Bella\ntakes can ever be excused?\n\"I have to say that of the seven men that\nBella killed, if I had read that six of them had\nbeen killed and then read what they had done\nbefore they were killed, I would say they\ndeserved it. They were such awful people, who\ncares?\"\nTell me about the Police Memorial Trust.\n\"Well, it's a charity I set up in 1984 when\nYvonne Fletcher was killed in St James's Square. Its object was to put up memorials to\nofficers slain on duty and encourage people to\nappreciate the good things that police do. I'm not saying they're perfect, of course they're not -I don't know any person that is perfect, never\nmind 160,000 people who are perfect. I did it\nbecause I felt very touched by her death.\"\nYou often edit your own work - why is that?\n\"Well I think I'm rather a good editor.\"\nI'm amazed at the range of films you made -do you ever feel frustrated by the way Death\nWish has pigeonholed you in the public's mind\nas an action director?\n\"Well, it's a pity. I would have preferred\nsome of the films that I think were every bit as\ninteresting to have done the same worldwide\nbusiness because then I could have, for example,\nbeen doing historical films or comedies more\noften! I'd rather, quite frankly, be directing\ncomedy all the time.\"\nWhat do you think about the state of the\nBritish film industry?\n\"It's a very poor state because it's made so\nmany films that people haven't seen. We tend to\nmake films that make a statement or please the\nartistic minority and we don't make the mass\nentertainment like Hollywood. I don't think the\ntaxpayer should pay for British films that the\npublic don't want to see.\"\nBut you encourage talent as well; can you tell\nme about the BAFT A Best Beginner Award?\n\"They asked me if I would do something for\nBAFTA. I had a think and I decided the people I would like to help are the kids at the bottom who\nare struggling, who get a job for a few weeks\nand sweep the floor and go and get the pizza.\nBut they're very important and I thought rather\nthan give all these awards to people at the top,\nlet's help the people at the bottom. Not only do\nwe give them the award but we gave them a damn good cash prize as well. It was won by\nfour very young people, they were absolutely\nthrilled and I was very happy to give it to them.\"\nTold you he was a nice blok e.

    "content": "2 News\nUoL to Split Up?\nBY ANDREW TSENG,\nNEWS EDITOR\nFears over the future of the federal\nUniversity of London have arisen\nthis week. Following a meeting of\nthe Academic Board of Queen\nMary and Westfield College\n( Q MW), the council of Q MW resolved that it is to seek the power\nto award its own degrees from the\nPrivy Council.\nProfessor Graham Zellick,\nPrinciple of QMW, last week issued\na statement which said that the\nAcademic Board had voted 36-4 in\nfavour of seeking degree awarding\npowers. Professor Zellick also said\nthat we would 'be writing formally\nto the Vice-Chancellor in the near\nfuture before taking matters further\nwith the Privy Council Office'.\nThis latest announcement by\nQMW has been seen by some as the\nmost recent criticism of the archaic\nnature in which the large colleges\nare restricted by being part of the\nfederal University of London.\nOn Commemoration Day last\nyear, Sir Eric Ash, former Rector of\nImperial College, said, \"our faith in\nthe ability of the University to deal\nefficiently and equitably with\ncollege business has been stretched,\nsometimes to near breaking point\nand occasionally beyond.\". A press\nofficer at the London School of\nEconomics ( LSE) said shortly\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nImperial College Boat Club was\nforced to cancel the National\nStudent Indoor Rowing Championships due to a low number of\nentries. The competitions were to\nhave been held last Sunday,\nSponsorship for the event had\nbeen secured from the manufacturers\nof Concept II, the ergo meter rowing\nmachine used by rowers for winter\ntraining.\nThe event had been moved from\nits usual date later in the year to\nattract rowing teams coming to\nLondon for a major rowing event\non the Saturday. Despite promoting\nthe event in the rowing magazine\nRegatta, less than 40 entries from\nother rowing teams around the\nafterwards, \"it is not a question of if\n[LSE d is affiliates from the\nUniversity of London], but when\".\nHowever, in an attempt to calm\nfears that QMW's ability to award\nits own degrees will act as a catalyst\nto the dissolving of the federal\nUniversity of London, Professor\nZellick states that the council had\n'underlined its commitment to the\nUniversity of London'. He continues\nby saying that the new power would\nonly be used under special\ncircumstances, such as the\nconferment of honorary degrees.\nIn response to criticisms of the\nstructure of the University of\nLondon, Professor Stuart\nSutherland, Vice-Chancellor of the\nUniversity, presented a paper in\nMarch detailing the paths that it\ncould take. These included larger\ncolleges becoming universities in\ntheir own right with no connection\nto the federal University, except\nhistorically. The question of\nde federal is ation is to be debated at\nthe next meeting of the Senate later\nthis month.\nA press spokesman for the\nUniversity of London said, \"our\nposition is that if [colleges] want to\npursue the opportunity to award\ndegrees then fair enough. There are\nno conscripts, the main thing is that\nthere is continuing strong interest in\nthe value of the name of the\nUniversity of London degree.\".\ncountry were received. Even with\nroughly 100 entries from rowers at\nImperial College, this fell short of\nthe 200 competitors expected.\nBill Mason, Imperial College\nBoat Club Coach, expressed regret\nover the cancellation. He cited the\nchanged date as being a problem for\nmany teams, since it was too early\nin the term for proper preparation. It\nalso clashed with an event in\nKingston. \" An extra few weeks\nwould have made the difference,\"\nhe said, \"but without enough teams\nfrom other places it wouldn't have\nbeen a meaningful event.\"\nThe sponsors have agreed to\ncover the costs incurred by the Boat\nClub in organising the champion-ships. It is hoped that the event will\ntake place as normal next year.\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nCatering at Imperial College takes a new twist on Tuesday with the\nopening of 'Basics', Southside's brand new pizzeria.\nLocated beside Southside Upper\nLounge, the cafe cost \u00a390,000 to\ndevelop and was designed as the\nfirst purpose built food outlet on the\ncampus. It will take over from\nBelushi's which was 'rushed in' in\n1985. It represents the first major\ncatering project from the\nManagement Planning Group since\n1986, when QT was set up in the\nJCR.\nThe initial menu consists of a bewildering variety of pizzas and\nfilled potatoes (which you can\nwatch being prepared). This will be\nexpanded to include such things as\nsalads and desserts. Soft and\nalcoholic drinks are also on sale.\nThe serial killers amongst you will\nbe pleased to note that Chianti is\navailable, though fava beans are as\nyet not an option.\nPrices are much the same as\nBelushi's( starting at about \u00a32 for a basic 9\" pizza), and you don't have\nto pay extra for any puns involving\nthe word 'basic' associated with\nyour meal. Incidentally, the name\n'Basics' has allegedly been derived\nfrom the word base (as in pizza\nbase) and IC.\nThe management team, led by\nNeil Turtell, are hoping that it will\nbecome 'the place to be' in College.\nFuture plans include a delivery\nservice, possibly run with student\nlabour.\nBasics will be open from\n11.45am to 1.45pm and 5.30pm to\n10pm daily from Tuesday, so if you\nfancy 'a really exciting concept', or\nsome food, there's somewhere new\nyou can go.\nNext week also sees the\nrenaming of the Southside disco.\n'Cobwebs', as it is to be known,\nwill be held on Thursday and\nFriday nights from 8.30pm to\n11.15pm in the bar. Spooky\ndecorations will be arriving shortly.\nRowing Cancelled\n. . .\nRTZ Inaugural Reception\nDr John Monhemius (left) being congratulated by Roy Wright (middle) and\nProfessor John Archer, Pro-Rector (right).\nTuesday saw the inaugural reception of the RTZ Roy Wright Readership.\nSpeaking after 27 years at Imperial College, as the first R TZ Roy\nWright Reader, Dr John Monhemius discussed the importance of\nunderstanding the environmental impact of industrial processes.\nThe Readership is named after Mr Roy Wright who, together with Sir\nVal Duncan and Sir Mark Turner was responsible for the original\ndevelopment of the RTZ Group. The sponsorship amounts to \u00a360,000 per\nyear for the next five years.\nBack to Basics\nDetails of the next Union General Meeting are on page 21\n\n"

    "content": "22 Letters\nEditorial\nFundamental Mistake\nThis last week I had the pleasure of various\nmembers of the Islamic Society complaining at\ngreat length to me about a Diary entry in last\nweek's Felix. They were all objecting about the\nentry for the Fundamentalist Society which was\nsupposed to be advertising their Friday prayers.\nThey were unam used at being referred to as\nFundamentalists and they each tried to argue at\ngreat length that I should have known that no\nsuch society existed.\nThe Diary entry in question was handed in to\nthe Felix Office with the society name listed as\nthe 'Fundamentalist Society'. With so many\nsocieties within Imperial College Union\n(somewhere in the region of 150) and with new\nsocieties being formed all the time, why\nshouldn't there be one called the Fundamentalist\nSociety. Sounds quite possible to me. Certain\nmeir lber s of the Islamic Society didn't seem to\nthink so.\nThe individual responsible for submitting the\nDiary entry left a note in my pigeonhole letting\nme know that his/her foolishness had 'pissed a lot of folks off. I'd never have guessed. The\nperson also requested a large anonymous\napology to be printed on their behalf. The\nIslamic Society members requested an apology\nfrom me. I am not going to apologise and I am\nnot going to print an apology from someone who\ndoes not have the guts to admit to their fellow\nsociety members that they call the Islamic\nSociety the Fundamentalist Society.\nOne final comment: Thanks to Amir for\nputting his point in writing. The letter is short\nand to the point, which is more than can be said\nfor the 'discussions' I had with some members\nof the Islamic Society.\nHyped Up And Over The Top\nLate last Wednesday evening, whilst the news\nteam were in the midst of writing the news,\nFelix received a press release concerning the\nwithdrawal of the cover of the rowing magazine,\nRegatta. The exact same release went to\nnumerous other news institutions around the\ncountry. We did not receive a press release\ninforming us of Bill Mason's Associateship or\nhis Medal of Honour.\nWe do not deny that the Boat Club under the\ncoaching of Bill Mason has achieved great\nthings, but we cannot, surprisingly enough,\nreport on news that we know nothing about.\nMaybe if this 'magnificent achievement' meant\nso much to the Boat Club, they could have\nensured that Felix was made aware of it. We\nwould then have been able to report on it.\nCould K. Woods please come into the office\nwith some form of ID.\nAll letters must be accompanied by a Union card or\nsome other form of identification. Letters without\nthis will not be published in the future.\nHyped Up And Over The Top\nDear Rebecca,\nI was very disappointed with the article in\nissue 978 of Felix concerning the withdrawal of\nthe latest issue of 'Regatta' magazine, and in\nparticular the manner in which Bill Mason, the\nBoathouse Manager and coach, was portrayed.\nBill Mason has made an enormous contribution\nto the College and the Boat Club in his fourteen\nyears with us, resulting in his being awarded an\nAssociateship of the College and the Amateur\nRowing Association Medal of Honour last\nmonth. These honours are the highest possible\nrecognitions of his long and dedicated service to\nthe College and the sport of rowing. However it\ntook a very unfortunate incident before Felix\nreported these magnificent achievements, and\nonly then in an uncomplimentary manner. The\narticle written by Michael Ingram, went, in my\nopinion, way over the top in an attempt to 'hype-up' the story, by emphasising the possible\nlikeness of the withdrawn cover photo with a terrorist. The publication of such an article, like\nthe publication of the photo, is \"inappropriate in\nany circumstances\". The photo in question was\ntaken over six months ago, in the middle of\nwinter, when such dress is essential for a rowing\ncoach who could be out on the water for an hour\nand a half in average temperatures of ten degrees\nbelow freezing. (Two years ago, the Cambridge\ncoach ended up in hospital with pneumonia as a result of not taking sufficient precautions against\nthe weather.) We also believe that the photo has\nbeen touched up to make Mr Mason's clothing\nappear completely black.\nI should add that on the same day that Felix\nwas released, a half page article was published\nin the Daily Telegraph, on the success of Bill\nMason's coaching and the recent awards that he\nhas received. Imperial featured very favourably\nin the article - it would be nice if we could\nrecognise within the College, some of the things\nfor which the College achieves national, and\neven international acclaim.\nBen Poulton\nICBC Captain.\nCAREERS INFORMATION\nThere are three Careers Talks this coming week\nin different venues.\nTuesday 16th November: Accountancy by Mr\nJames Robb of CASIS and Mr Alan Morris,\nFinancial Director, Sirnmons & Simmons in The\nClore Theatre, Huxley LT213, l pm1.50 pm.

    "content": "Reviews 11\nThe Concierge\nStarring: Michael J Fox, Gabrielle Anwar\nDirector: Barry Sonnenfeld\nThis movie will be discussed in film schools for\nyears to come. I'm being serious, it's a perfect\nexample of how a film which should be\nsuccessful can go horribly wrong.\nNot that this has anything to do with the plot;\nit is a starry-eyed 'homage' to the genre of the\nNew York romantic comedy. Michael J Fox\nplays Doug Ireland, the streetwise and genie-like\nconcierge of the opulent Bradbury Hotel, who\nspends his life catering to the whims of guests\nwhile dreaming of building a hotel of his own.\nHe meets a wealthy entrepreneur named\nHanover, who agrees to finance the construction\nprovided Doug 'returns his favour' by\nbabysitting his attractive young mistress, Andy\n(played by Gabrielle Anwar). Inevitably, Doug\nand Andy end up together as they realise that\nHanover is using both of them for his selfish\npurposes.\nDespite the promise of the plot, this film is,\non the whole, disappointing. The reason why is\nnot obvious; the cast are excellent, especially\nMichael J Fox, who displays surprising comic\ntiming in an assured performance. The direction\nis rather jolly, with upbeat camera angles and\nediting. The problem is the producer, Brian\nGrazer, who made the appa ling Far And Away.\nDoug (Michael J Fox) has problems when he has to babysit Andy (Gabrielle Anwa\nHis choice of director is simply inappropriate.\nDon't get me wrong, Sonnenfeld showed a fine\ncomic touch with The Addams Family, but his\nstyle just doesn't work with this script.\nConsequently, the film lacks the pace needed\nto be truly funny. There are, however, several\nextremely good gags (approximately one every\ntwenty minutes), so you are almost guaranteed to\nlaugh at least once.\nThis film is almost perfect for those intending\nto s nog someone in the back row of the cinema -you won't miss seeing anything important and\nevery time you come up for breath there will be\na good joke to listen to. The lonesome, on the\nother hand, may be better served elsewhere.\nMichael\nCentury\nStarring: Robert Stevens, Clive Owen, Miranda\nRichardson, Charles Dance,\nDirector: Stephen Poliakoff\nWelcome to the New Century - because this film\nis set at the turn of the century.\nThe interesting things about this are the\nparallels made to the time we are living in now,\neven though the dimensions are fairly different.\nIn both cases, a new era is starting. We laugh\nabout the imaginations they had about the future\njust as the people in 2020 will laugh about\ncurrent science fiction. Of course, many features\nof society have changed but many structures,\nespecially those concerning power, have\nremained. The ways of science have developed,\nbut somehow many features are not that\ndifferent after all.\nNowadays, we are faced with ethical\nquestions concerning genetical engineering\nwhereas, at this time, eugenics was actually\nconsidered a serious topic by many academics.\nThey thought they didn't have to ask the\n'underclass' whether they want to be sterilised;\nwe do not 'ask' the embryos whether they want\nto be conceived in a test tube.\nThe film is beautifully made, with carefully\ndefined characters. There is Robert Stevens as\nMr Reisner, an eccentric and overwhelming\nJewish Scotsman - I think I would like his\nparties. Clive Owen plays the ambitious and\nvery capable Dr Paul Reisner who starts at a medical research institute but subsequently gets\ninto severe difficulties. This is not made easier\nby the fact that he finds it impossible to tell his\nfather (who is very enthusiastic about his son's new career) about the situation. Additionally,\nPaul falls in love with Clara (Miranda\nRichardson), who is a rather unconventional lab\nassistant at the institute.\nCharles Dance plays a charismatic figure,\nProfessor Mandry, the head of the institute,\nexcellent in his field but secretly ruthless against\neverybody standing in his way. Paul suddenly\nbecomes his brutal enemy after having been his\nprotege and unfortunately, connections can not\nonly be made but also broken.\nWelcome to the New Century again!\nKristine\nThe Forbidden Quest\nStarring: Joseph O 'Connor\nDirector: Peter Delpeut\nThis film is expansive in many ways. The use of\nhistorical footage from early expeditions to the\nPoles is the most obvious. The slight jerky\nimages of fur lined pioneers are comic, even in\nthe black and whiteness of the environment they\nendure. But the obvious problem with the film is\nthat the wide encompassing of the plot, a creepy\nattempt to find the mythical tunnel between the\ntwo poles, cannot be supported only by repeated\nimages of men running through the snow and\nships stuck in the ice.\nThe cohesion between it all is Joseph O' Connor, who plays the ship's carpenter, the only\nclich e to escape the icy ordeal. Yet even he\nnever really holds in a sufficient way to fully\njustify the attempt, however laudable; and it is\nlaudable.\nThe point that did trouble me was the killing\nof a polar bear. The king of all it surveyed was\nbroken by means it could not understand. It was\nspine chilling.\nTintin\nBo' went to Brighton - read all about it on page 17\n\n"

    "content": "18 Feature\nLots Of Fun\nThe Photographic Society is a club on the move\nin more senses than one. Not only have we\nmoved into a brand new darkroom, but we are\nalso expanding into other areas. These include\nstudio photography, presentations by guest\nspeakers and trips to exhibitions and galleries.\nThe club's raison d'e tre is to allow your interest\nin photography to develop and to teach you how\nto make your own prints and to develop your\nfilms.\nBut why develop and print your own pictures\nwhen you can get it done in the shop? Three\ngood reasons: Firstly, save yourself money -guaranteed unbeatable prices and half price\nblack and white films. Secondly, you are\ncompletely unrestricted in the size and style of\npicture you want - this is particularly useful for\nthose personalised posters of your dreams.\nFinally, you can express yourself artistically -there are numerous printing techniques which\nwe can show you that can transform the\nordinary into the fantastic.\nThis year has seen the opening of a brand\nnew darkroom which is equipped with a full\nrange of equipment for both colour and black\nand white film. It is in this spacious\nenvironment that much more of the club's activites take place, including assistance in\nthose first few delicate development sessions.\nThe darkroom is stocked with films, paper and\nchemicals to make it as convenient as possible.\nFeature 19\nIn The Dark\nThe main activities this term include a number of group sessions for printing,\ndeveloping and studio work. These offer a great\nchance to meet new and interesting people and\nto learn skills that you would find difficult to\nacquire elsewhere. Last Wednesday saw the first\nof our presentations by guest speakers, which\nwill be a regular feature throughout the year\nand will cover photojournalism, portrait\nphotography and more.

It takes place in the JCR and\nruns from Monday 15th November to Friday\n19th November, 10am to 4pm. During this\nperiod some of the roughly 2,500 strong\noverseas community will display the richness of\nits culture to the College. Each day, stalls from\nvarious societies will be run by overseas\nstudents from around the world. All25 constituent societies of the Overseas Students\nCommittee (OSC) will have the opportunity to\neducate and explain their culture to you. At the\nstalls will be music, videos and other displays.\nYou will be able to speak to the society\nmembers and find out more about their country\nand its culture.\nOverseas Week is just one of many events\norganised by the OSC. Their objective is to coordinate and develop the interests of the\noverseas students at the college. It achieves this\nby supervising and financially supporting the\nrunning of 25 overseas societies, co-ordinating\nits own larger scale events and representing the\ninterests of overseas students on many College\nand Union committees.\nAs with Overseas Week, the OSC tries to\nintegrate the local and overseas communities by\narranging events that act not only as a meeting\npoint for international students, but also serve as\na forum where home students can get to know\nmore about the vast diversity of cultures on\noffer. The hugely popular International Nite in\nMarch, as well as many other events organised\nby the OSC and its constituent societies, are\nopen to all students of Imperial College. You\nwill probably never encounter such diversity\nagain, so come along and take part!\nChristmas Extravaganza!\nWhere can you experiment with paint and tinsel,\ndesign Christmas cards on an Apple Mac and\nwatch Father Christmas float in ajar of snow?\nHow do you give your silhouette to your\nfriend, write your name in Chinese, capture your\nhand print in plaster and smash a rat?\nWhen can you meet Father Christmas,\nanswer a police quiz and build some scientific\ngames? What is the date for the best children's Christmas party in town?\nThe Christmas Caper is on Sunday 5th December from 2.30pm5.30 pm in the Sherfield\nBuilding - the children's party with a distinctively scientific flavour with craft stalls\nand games for children of all ages to experiment,\nmodel, paint, design and play. Bob\nThingamybob will entertain younger children\nwith action songs, magic and a puppet show.\nThe explain ers from the Science Museum will\nbring along the best of the Launch Pad exhibits\nand Father Christmas will arrive from Lapland\non 'Bo' before entertaining in his festive cabin.\nBlue Watch will be on hand with their fire\nengine, a fascinating street of 'hands on' and\nengineering stalls will intrigue older children\nand everyone will be treated to a delicious tea.\nThis is the ideal opportunity to introduce a child to the wonders of science, technology and\nmedicine through an event that will be high\ncalibre, exciting and enormous fun for you and\nyour young guests. Do come, it will be a wondrous day.

    "content": "6 Reviews\nKate Bush\nThe Red Shoes\nOh dear. I waited a long time for this. I wondered why they picked 'Rubber Band Girl'\nas a single. That and 'Eat The Music' are the\nonly remotely interesting things on the album.\nKate Bush has farmed acres of celestial light\nsources but I'm loath to mention their names,\nbecause they must surely be disappointed with\nthe dim result. It won't put you off your food but\nfor goodness sake, it's extraordinary: Prince\nfeatures in one of the tracks and it still emerges a uniform stream of banal mush. Reading the\nwords in the cassette insert is more engaging\nthan the performances. There are a couple of\ninteresting images but they take so ooo ooo long\nto arrive, and are delivered so unconvincingly\nthat after a few songs (I'm afraid you really can\ngeneral is e with this album) you find yourself\ndespairing of finding any satisfaction. Roll on\nThe Stones, Kate is gathering moss. (3)\nDave T. Released on EMI\n\u2022 P Tad - The big lads with mad eyes could teach Clinton a thing or two about the respiration system\nTad\nInhaler\nThis new album finds Tad moving towards a far\nmore rock oriented sound. Like most Sub Pop\nbands their music has become progressively less\ndistorted over the years, and Dinosaur Jr'sJ. Mascis at the production controls extracts\nprobably their best guitar sound to date. Pearl\nJam and the Screaming Trees are the closest\nreference points and like these two, the vocalist\nsets the whole band ahead of the pack. Tad\nDoyle's vocal range has expanded from the\nsnarl of 'God's Balls' and '8-Way Santa' but\ndon't expect any ballads yet. Sub Pop fans could\nbe disappointed but rock fans may be\n(un)pleasantly surprised. (6)\nRidley Dash\nReleased on Sub Pop\nRosa Mota\n7 Inch Sulk\nThe A side of this limited edition release, 'Stop\nI Start' is, according to the press release, a live\nfavourite. I can see why. It's a dirty,\nclaustrophobic piece of not quite grunge which\nrevels in the line \"**** me gently with a chainsaw\", a good opportunity for crowd\ninvolvement if I 've ever heard one. \"I swear I can't do anything /1 swear I can't?\" barks the\nsinger and he's right. The young lady with the\nvoice like a wisp of cloud who pops up\nunexpectedly in the chorus can though. The\ndownside to this song is - gasp! - the guitars\nsound like Sonic Youth, but we've lived with\nthat before. Buy it, kids.\nRidley Dash\nReleased on Placebo\n:\n::\n;:\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n:o:;:::::::::::: \u00a3:\n::\n::\n:;\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n::\n:\nFamily Cat\nSpringing the Atom\nThe record label reckons this \"marks yet another\nsonic step forward for the band\" and, for once,\nyou can believe the hype.\n'Springing...' boasts a great hook amidst\natmospheric strings and worthy guitar breaks,\nproving The Cat to be way above yer standard\nindie-guitar fare. But don't buy this for the\nA side alone. 'Prop 4' is even better, with all\nmanner of strangled guitar noises wrapped\naround a punk-inspired melody. Give this single\na spin!\nVlk\nRelease on Dedication\nlil ill l ll III\nSoul Asylum\nAstoria\nIt's that difficult first shot at the big time show\nand things ain't running to plan. Out go the\nhardcore following and in sweep the MTV masses. The Venus Beads open the show with\ntheir poppy Teenage Fanclub sound but the\ncrowd aren't into it. They're here to see stars.\nAfter a lengthy wait Soul Asylum take the\nstage. Ten years or so on the road has made\nthem an awesome live band, but they are\nreluctant stars. Anything off 'Grave Dancers\nUnion' is met with crowd surfing or raised\nlighters (?) depending on tempo, while their\nriotous covers and older stuff are met with\npuzzled indifference. This visibly strains Dave\nPirner their singer, and despite a magnificent set\nthe gig ends somewhat abruptly and\nacrimonious ly.A year ago, Soul Asylum blew\nthe roof off the Marquee and tonight I think they\nwould much rather have been there.\nEvan Dando arrived late, blowing out his\npromised support slot, but appeared briefly in a cameo role as a drunken bum, which he carried\noff with ease.\nRidley Dash\nSilverscreen\nImperial College\nSilverscreen are playing carnival esque music to\ntwo hundred drunken revellers, but the crisp\ndistinctive edge that grabbed me at the\nsoundcheck has been lost somewhere between\nthe free-flowing cider and the awful tinny setup.\nThe lead singer nods his head to Brett\nAnderson's cockney swooning but barely taps\nhis foot on stage. And he's dressed in denim,\ngood grief, you simply cannot stand still and\nlook languid in black lev is. Meanwhile, the\nothers spiral about in their own little orbits. (I know, I know, cut to the chase!)\nThe point? This band are ex-Jazz and Rock\nascendants. You know, the guys no-one goes to\nwatch on a Thursday night. And they're good!\nPeople are dancing! 'Splinter', the set closer and\nthe best of a sometimes uneven repertoire, feels\ncomplete and ready to wed vinyl. Earlier on,\nwith two less guitars and a keyboard they\ndefined a sound they could certainly claim to be\nnearly their own. What's needed are several\nmore great strides away from Southside Lounge.\nA little cohesion and a little confidence (yes,\nyou can sing, yes, you can turn down that\npersuasive bass a little).\nAnd then you'll all be clam our ing to claim\nyou saw the premier screening.\nOwain\nDetails of the Jurassic Park showings are on page 20\n\n"

    "content": "imperial College Union 21\nThe President Speaks\nWhat is the Union doing about the Student Union Reforms and what will b happening at next week's Union General Meeting? Andy Wensley tells all.\nStudent Union Reforms\n...it would be illegal for Imperial College Union to\nfund the Orchestra...\nElections\nIn order to work for you, the Union has many\nStudent Officers. They may run clubs, work\non welfare issues or academic problems,\nserve on committees, help make financial\ndecisions...the list goes on.\nThese officers are democratically elected\nat Union General Meetings, like the one\ncoming up on Friday 19th November.\nThere are three posts currently available:\nThe Accommodation Officer.\nHad problems with your hall of residence in\nthe past? Do you feel that accommodation\nfor Imperial College students should be made\nbetter? Then this could be the job for you.\nLiaising with hall committees, wardens, the\nAccommodation Office, working with other\nUnion Officers, the experience could be\nhighly valuable for later life.\nThe Communications Officer.\nThe Communications Officer exists to let\nyou know what the Union is doing. The\nOfficer is responsible for the internal\npromotion of campaigns, meetings and\nissues. Along with the Events and Marketing\nManager, the Officer helps to promote the\nservices of the Union to the community of\nImperial College. Do you think of yourself as\na budding PR officer? This could be the one\nfor you.\nFelix Business Manager.\nFancy babysitting the 'budget' of Felix and\nthe Print Unit? Described by a previous\nBusiness Manager as 'hard work', this post\ngives you a valuable insight into business\nand how Felix and the Print Unit operate.\nHow do I get elected?\nSimple. Opposite from the Union Office in\nBeit Quad are the 'papers'. It is here that you\nsign up your name and get the person\nproposing you and your second ers to do the\nsame. They must all be registered students of\nImperial College. The papers will stay up\nuntil 12.30pm on Friday 19th November.\nWhere am I elected?\nYou will be elected at the Union General\nMeeting, l pm, Friday 19th November in the\nJCR.\nAny questions?\nJust contact Andy Wensley, ICU President\neither on extension 3501 or pop into the\nUnion Office for a chat. He'll be happy to\nsee you and to answer any questions that you\nmay have.\nIf you haven't yet realised, the Government\nwants to change what student unions, like ours,\ncan spend their grants on. The changes would\nmean our Union could only fund a limited\nnumber of activities:\n\u2022 Sport\n\u2022 Welfare\n\u2022 Internal Representation\n\u2022 Catering.\nThis means that most of our clubs could not\nreceive funding; it would be illegal for Imperial\nCollege Union to fund the Orchestra, for\nexample.\nJust as concerning are the ways in which the\nGovernment wants student unions to ensure that\nthey do not spend money illegally. To enforce\nthe proposed 'cost cent ring' measures would\nmean more time, more staff and consequently\nmore money being spent on administration\ninstead of on student activities.\nOver the last few months, student unions\nhave been responding to these proposals, saying\nhow their students would be affected, usually to\nthe detriment of student welfare. Imperial\nCollege Union has been doing just that. A detailed report was sent to the Secretary of State\nreporting how Imperial College students would\nbe affected, how their 150 clubs and societies\nwould be damaged and how much extra money\nwe would have to find from non-public sources.\nIf these proposals were implemented, we may\nhave to find over \u00a3200,000 - a lot of money in\nanyone's language.\nNow that our formal report has gone to the\nGovernment, the Union isn't stopping there. A petition urging the Secretary of State to\nreconsider the proposed reforms is making its\nway around the departments. By last Friday, it\nhad already gathered over 750 signatures from\nonly four departments! If you haven't heard\nabout it, contact your Departmental\nRepresentative; there still is time if you want to\nsign. Union Officers are meeting local MPs,\ntelling them how their student voters will be\naffected. Hopefully, a mass letter writing\ncampaign should be starting soon, where you\ncan all write to your local MP and tell him what\nyou think about these reforms.\nWhat can we expect? From numerous\nsources we are already hearing that the\nGovernment is taking note of what student\nunions, universities and other organisations are\nsaying and may be changing their proposals.\nThey may even be dropping the entire proposal.\nTo find that out, we can only wait. In the mean\ntime our student union will carry on talking,\nworking and convincing people that student\nwelfare has to be protected, that student unions\nplay a valuable role in the life of an institution\nsuch as Imperial College.\nIf you want to know any more about the\nstudent union reform and what Imperial College\nUnion is doing, come to the Union Office, 1st floor of the Union Building, Beit Quad and ask\nto see the President, Andy Wensley. He'll be\nonly too happy to talk to you.\nUnion General MeetingNext Friday, l pm, JCR\nThis is the forum where you can determine what\nImperial College Union should be doing. It is\nalso the place where you can question the Union\nOfficers on what they have been doing on your\nbehalf since the last Union General Meeting\n(UGM) and where you can elect new Officers to\nwork for you.\nThe next U GM will be held on Friday 19th November in the J CR( off the Sherfield\nWalkway) at l pm. Each meeting has several parts:\n\u2022 reports\n\u2022 questions\n\u2022 elections\n\u2022 motions.\nThe reports are given by Union Officers.\nYou can ask them questions on their reports and\nany other part of their work you want to know\nabout. There are elections for new Officers and\nmotions directing the Union and affecting\nstudents are debated and voted on.\nIf you want to submit a motion for the U GM, it must reach the Union Office by 6pm today. If\nyou want to submit a motion later than that, talk\nto the President.\nIf you want to stand for a post, see the article\ntitled 'Elections' elsewhere on this page.\nRemember, the motions must be handed in\ntoday but the U GM is a week today on Friday\n19th November.\nMotions must be submitted to the Union Office by 6pm today\n\n"

We\nhave three bands playing: The Humble Slug\n(featuring one of our own sabbaticals),\nSilverscreen and Slithey Tove. There will also\nbe Bungee Running, which should prove to be\nfun. The Union will be open until 2am with a bar until lam.\nOn Saturday, anyone who wants a good\nlaugh should watch the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump taking place outside\nSharks Spotted\nLast weekend saw the first trip this year for IC\nSharks, the Boardsailing Club, to Brightlingsea\nin Essex. We left College on Friday afternoon\nwith seventeen people and as much kit as we\ncould carry without overloading the minibus\n(honestly, constable). After a trouble free\njourney we arrived at Essex University Boat\nClub. After quickly dumping our stuff we drove\nback to Essex University at Colchester, where\nwe met up with our hosts. As soon as we got\nacc lim at is ed to the totally different union bar\n(i.e. there were girls there) we went on mass to\ncheck out the disco, which again was different\n(there were people dancing) and there we stayed\nuntil it finished.\nThe next morning we headed for Clacton\nbeach and some sailing with average wind\nMatch 1: IC 1 - 0 CX WM S Match 2: IC 0 - 9 Cambridge University\nOnly the Dribblers that do both in the same day.\nWe started off strong, back to the old form with\nthe keeper only touching the ball once in the\nfirst half and that was for a goal kick. Despite\ndominating, we hit the post, the keeper and\neverything but the back of the net and at half\ntime it was still 0 - 0.\nTen minutes into the second half Chris\ncollected a goal kick and returned it over the\nhead of the keeper for our first league goal. A couple of minutes later, also true to form, Chris\nre-did last year's injury and had to be carried off\nthe pitch. Thanks goes to the ref for expert first\naid. A bit of reshuffling and we finished at 1 - 0.\nWe played our best match yet.\nHarrods at midday. This involves the\nparticipants jumping out of a minibus wearing\nno clothes and then running as fast as possible to\nCollege without getting arrested first. In the\nevening there is a Pub Crawl in aid of Leukemia\nResearch. Anyone wishing to take part should\nmeet at 4pm in the Union lounge.Afterwards\nthere is a party in the union for all\ncollectors.Many colleges are participating and\nthere are prizes for top individual collector , top\nteam and top University;they are aTV for the\nindividual prize and lots of beer for the latter\ntwo categories.We hope to see lots of you there.\nSunday is the very last day of Rag Week\n(a a ah!) and it is the day of the Rag Rugby.The\nIC Virgins are tackling the Royal School of\nMines team so it should be an excellent match.\nThanks to everyone who has helped towards\nthe running of Rag Week and we hope everyone\nhas enjoyed the events so far and most\nimportantly had fun.\nconditions, so everyone could sail with 'relative'\nease. We came off the water as it got dark and\nheaded for Brightlingsea to defrost ourselves in\nthe showers. Several hours later, everyone was\nshowered, we then spent ages deciding which\nrestaurant to go to, only to find out that our\neventual choice didn't want us, so we got takeaways instead.\nLater, we drove into Clacton once more and\nhit one of the local bars (although some of our\nnumber thought the amusements next door\nlooked much more interesting and took a detour). At closing time, feeling that we had not\nhad enough beer, we drove back to the boat club\nwhere we set about finishing the five crates that\nwe had brought along, as well as a couple of\nbottles of spirits. Suffice to say that by the end\nWe came into the second match (20 minutes\nlater) still on a high from our win and were\nquickly brought back down to earth with three\ngoals in ten minutes. Well the keeper, Linda,\nsaid she was bored in the first match! After 15\nminutes we settled down and played well\ndefensively. In the second half a cracking shot\nfrom just outside the box was saved by\nJulianna's face (on the edge of the box) - yet\nanother player had to be assisted from the field.\nWe were out-played and out-classed as the score\nshows, but we were playing a team that would\nusually take on the UL U side but we're not out\nof it yet. The usual post-match boat race was\nreplaced this week by a wheelchair race at\nAshford Hospital.\nI CAF C1st24 Goldsmiths\nHaving made a tactical withdrawal from the\nU AU in order to concentrate on the league and\ncup, IC l sts travelled to Goldsmiths with a new\nline up and high hopes for their first victory.\nWe was robbed! Within ten minutes, their\nreferee gave them a dubious penalty to put them\none up. However, the lads were not disheartened and equalise d through Tom Robson's throw and Bill Khatib's quality finish. Ben\nWillis, Tom Robson, Cristas Mettouris and Rob\nWilliams held the team together until one of\nGoldsmith's forwards walked through five\ntackles to slip the ball past Mark Nally.\nAn inspirational talk at half time resulted in\nan equalise r. However, suspect midfield play\nand poor attitudes from Rickie Dixon, Tellis\nBotzios and Alex de Stefano allowed the\nGoldsmith's players to queue up to score twice.\nWe were crap, the sandwiches were awful\nbut 'lovely boy' Dennis' smile was all that IC\nl sts needed for hope for the future (maybe!).\nof the evening, everyone had had enough to\ndrink.\nWe awoke on Sunday morning to the smell of\na cooked breakfast, just what you need after a night like that. We set off after breakfast back to\nClacton, where conditions were fairly similar to\nSaturday. The only difference was that we\nmanaged to break three boards, a sail and a boom. We loaded all the kit back onto the\nminibus one last time and set off for the boat\nclub. Once we had made sure that everything\nwas as we found it, we set off back to London,\nwith James (or Dorothy as he had been called)\nfinally getting a chance to drive the bus.\nSurprisingly enough we got back to college\nwithout any disasters and so ended the first and\nvery successful trip for the Sharks this year.\nSports Results\nAll matches were away games and were\nplayed against Brunei University:\nSquash:\nIC 3 - 2 Brunei\nMens' Hockey:\nIC 1st11 Brunei\nIC 2nd20 Brunei\nIC 3rd11 Brunei\nLadies' Hockey:\nIC 1st lost to Brunei\nIC 2nd lost to Brunei\n(unsure of scores at time of going to press)\nLast Weekend At Clacton\nWin Some, Lose Some\nOverseas Week previewed on page 16\n\n"

    "content": "4 Reviews\nThe Busybody\nThe Busybody, by Susanna Centlivre, is a restoration comedy written in the early 1700s and is an adventurous undertaking by Southbank\nProductions. The dialogue is eloquent\neighteenth century, the poetry rich and witty, the\nprose clever and bawdy. The action takes place\non a chequered dance floor which is a symbol of\nthe perpetual man oe uv ring between the\ncharacters. The dialogue is punctuated with\nballroom dancing - an interesting touch as the\ncharacters metaphorically dance around one\nanother.\nThe characters include Sir George Airy and\nCharles, two rich young fops with plenty of\nspare time to indulge in matters of the heart.\nMarplot is the interfering fool. Sir Jealous\nTraffick is the puritanical father of Isabinda.\nPatch and Whisper are the chamber maid and\nfootman respectively, who keep the wheels of\n'lu r ve' lubricated and running throughout.\nMemorable performances came from Steven\nWoodhouse (Sir Jealous Traffic) and Jeremy\nFowlds (Marplot), with some excellent body\nlanguage from Patch and Whisper (Catherine\nStanden and Harry Gostelow).\nIn the final analysis, an audience full of wine\nguzzling wastrels would complement the play.\nSo, theatre lovers, dust down those eighteenth\ncentury threads, shamble down to Battersea,\npick up a large bottle of claret and enjoy.\nLisa and Rob\nBridge Lane Theatre, Bridge Lane, Battersea,\nLondon SW11. Telephone 071-228 8828. Cones\n\u00a36.50. Ends 20th Nov.\nii fi Soiree\nFresh from the Edinburgh Festival, the Yvette\nBozsik Theatre Company fuse acting, dance and\nmime in this memorable double bill. If this\ncombination might lead you to expect an\nevening of gratuitous piddling about, think\nagain, for Bozsik achieves a refreshingly\nunpretentious observation of human behaviour.\nSoiree examines the developing relationships\nof two women and a man at a party. The former\nare relentlessly vying for the latter who is\nforever losing interest and falling asleep.\nThe stylistic, even ritualistic, movement and\ndance allows the characters to develop slowly\nand in detail. In one superb tableau, they are\ndrinking champagne. Eva Magyar sips\nseductively, Robin Blackledge takes the bouquet\nwith nonchalant panache, Bozsik stares\nawkwardly down into her glass. It's all captured\nwith unerring simplicity and honesty - and as an\nobservation of life is a thorough success.\nBilled as a companion piece, Interiors is a( yet) more intimate and erotic one, a meticulous\n(almost too meticulous) interpretation of piano\nmusic by Chopin, Ligeti and Satie.\nIf you are interested in theatre it's a show\nyou can't ignore. It's the very essence of fringe:\nsimple talent and offbeat creativity and if the\nintricacy of Soiree occasionally fails to keep the\nattention, it's worth it for the sheer beauty of\nYvette Bozsik and her captivating performance.\nMike\nHampstead Theatre, Avenue Rd, NW1, 071 722\n9301, Swiss Cottage tube. Tickets: \u00a38 - \u00a312.50,\ncones \u00a34 (not Sat eve). Ends 13th November\nExact Change\nThe simple story interwoven with juicy and\nintriguing details opens up with a set on which\nno expense was spared.\nThe three characters, all partners in a business (the business being a semi-gro tty bar)\nmeet one Sunday to discuss their financial\narrangements with the Mafia. They can't pay (if\nthey did the play would be very dull) and hence\nresort to a drastic measure to get some cash and\nfast.\nKevin McNally and Steven O 'Shea do well\nas the extras to Mike McShane, even though\nthey wouldn't like being referred to in that\nmanner.\nBut the truth must be said, Mike McShane is\nthe star. He delivers one liners that are funnier\nthan those produced on Whose Line Is It\nAnyway? with an ability that's hard to top. It is\nshame however that the rest of the play has the\nsame Whose Line Is It Anyway? feel to it\nbecause it tarnishes what would have been a shiny, prime example of a blend of comedy and\nnot-to-serious drama.\nThe end, to my annoyance, wasn't left open,\nit just wasn't finished properly. Apart from that,\nI see no reason not to spend a bit of money on\ntickets.\nHarry\nLyric Hammersmith, King St, W6, 081 741\n2311, Hammersmith tube. Tickets: \u00a37.50 - \u00a310.\nEnds 6th December\nThe Party\nCard\nThe Party Card, by Russian playwright Nicolai\nErdman and translated by Peter Tegel, is a farce\nin the same tradition as the Whitehall farces or\nthose of Michael Frayn's. The play was written\nin 1924 when there was a tremendous flowering\nof creativity in the arts which came to an abrupt\nhalt with Stalin's reign. While much of Europe\nwas trying to put World War One behind it,\nMother Russia was coming to terms with life\nunder Communism.\nThe Party Card is the story of two families,\nthe Guliatchkins, once monied but now fallen on\nhard times and the Smetaniches, wealthy and\npowerful. The Smetaniches have everything\nexcept... a party card, essential protection in\nthese times! Mrs Guliatchkin's plan, hatched\nwith Mr Smetanich's eager endorsement, is to\nmarry off her daughter to Valerian Smetanich\nand offer her son, Pavel, as a party official - the\ndowry.\nThe only trouble is that Pavel is not a Communist, does not have a card and besides,\ndoes not even know a member of the working\nclass, apart from the family maid, Anastasia. As\nif this doesn't forebode enough trouble, Mrs\nGuliatchkin's trials are added to when she is\nasked by an aristocratic friend to look after a very valuable dress that once belonged to a member of the last Czar's family.\nIn the best tradition of farce, the play is full\nof cases of mistaken identity, unfortunate\ntimings and potty characters. The company, The\nWedding Collective, clearly enjoyed their\nperformance. Jim Pyke (Pavel) is just right as a young man who takes to playing the heavy\nhanded party official with alarming zeal.\nVarvara Guliatchkin, his sister, is divine as a young lady who is desperately keen to snap up\nValerian Smetanich. Patrick Kealey plays\nValerian, a droopy young man who is rather\nsuspicious of his intended's peculiar behaviour.\nAnastasia, the goofy, good humour ed maid is\nwonderfully played by Sue Maund, and David\nPrice as the much maligned neighbour\nShironkin, is perfect as a man who is always\nraging (and losing) against the world.\nNo-one escapes the ridicule and pity of\nErdman, the Communists, the capitalists, the\nmonarchists, the working and middle classes - in\nfact all of Mother Russia. The play is very funny\nand the company have made excellent use of\nlimited resources. Beneath the humour lies a truth: because we all aspire to a country in our\nown image, we fight over its possession, only to\nfind that one group cannot exist without the\nother. The losers in this power game are those\nwho belong to neither side.\nOne last note, much of the humour directed\nagainst the aristocracy and middle classes\nseemed rather close for comfort and I wondered\nif seventy years on, the implied criticisms were\nmore relevant to Great Britain than Russia.\nAriana Sen\nNew End Theatre, 27 New End, NW3. 071 794\n0022. Hampstead tube.Tickets: \u00a38.50 (\u00a39 on\nSat), cones: \u00a36 (not Sat).\nNext Week: A review of Looking Through A Glass Onion\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 17\nImperial College Rifle and Pistol Club\nThis is the oldest Student Union club at Imperial\nCollege, running continuously since 1908. Its\norigins can be traced back to 1859. Past\nmembers included three Commonwealth Games\nmedalists (one gold and two bronze), four\nOlympic Games finalists and two world record\nholders. More recently, successes include\nretaining the Howe Cup (Universities Long\nRange Pistol) for the last five years and winning\nall of the last two years' worth of shoulder to\nshoulder matches against other universities.\nThe range is situated in the Sports Centre,\nbehind the door euphemistically described as\n'Projectile Hall'. This is a purpose built range\noriginally for .22 rifle only, but upgraded to\ncater for pistols of all calibres in 1984. There are\nplenty of club firearms to choose from and all\ninstruction and coaching is free.\nThe subscription is \u00a38 per year and the\nammunition attracts a generous sub vent ion from\nthe Union. Currently we are shooting every\nWednesday afternoon and all day Saturday each\nweek and other times by arrangement. The club\nhas been well endowed with trophies to shoot\nfor, both individual and inter-CCU.\nShooting is truly a sport for all, we can even\ncater for to xo phi lists( archers) so come along\nand give it a try. If you've shot before you may\nbe interested in competition. There are numerous\ndisciplines catered for from UIT air rifle to\nservice pistol. If you are a novice no problem - a handicap ladder is run to encourage that\ncompetitive edge. We also run trips to other\nranges such as Bisley for full bore rifle shooting\nand long range pistol practice. Come along and\ngive it a try. You don't know what you're\nmissing.\nBo' Goes To Brighton Rowing Results\nThe London to Brighton Veteran Car Rally takes\nplace once every year and is an opportunity for\npresent day motorists to experience the joys of a day at the seaside as experienced by their fore-fathers. It achieves this very well if one\ndiscounts the non-period traffic lights, all the\nother cars on the road, and the fact that no-one\nin their right mind would choose the first\nSunday in November to go for a drive to the sea,\nwhatever the historical period.\nLast Sunday's veteran car run to Brighton\nmust qualify as one of the longest Bo' has taken\npart in. Ever. What with the ever lengthening\ndetours up increasingly steep hills (or so it\nseems), Bo' and the other 60+ cars are finding it\nharder and harder to arrive each year. Bo's abysmal mechanical condition this year possibly\ndidn't help either.\nTo give you a clue as to the sort of effort\nTeam Bo' (as his maintenance crew is known)\nhad to undertake, at 10am on Saturday morning\nhe had no MOT or road tax and most of his\nengine was on the garage floor. However, a small miracle prevailed and somehow all the\nrequirements for him to reach the start line were\nmet and off we trundled.\nA couple of miles down the road we hit our\nfirst problem and spluttered to an untimely halt\nfor no apparent reason. On opening the bonnet,\nit was found that one of the cylinders had sprung\na water leak and water was now gushing out in a great arc and landing in the engine air intake,\nHalf an hour, a tube of bathroom sealant and\nseveral strips of binding rag later we were off\nagain, this time as far as Streatham, where we\nhad a puncture. Another quarter of an hour and a new inner tube was what it took to get us back\non the road on this occasion. By now we were\nwell behind the rest of the field and discovered\nthat all the helpful police who marshal you\nthrough red lights had gone home. This made\ntrying to catch up harder, even more so when we\nhit the first real hill, overheated and broke down\nagain. Another stop to cool and refill with water\nand off to Redhill, our first scheduled stop!\nAs the engine was very stiff at this point, we\nadded several squirts of oil to the pistons to get\nthem moving and, suitably freed up, we were off\nagain at a comparatively cracking pace. We kept\nthis up with only a couple of stops (one to\nchange co-driver) until Brighton, where we\ndiscovered fortune had smiled on us - it hadn't rained all day!! Eventually, we crept over the\nfinishing line with only 45 minutes to spare\nbefore it was closed, having taken seven and a quarter hours to cover 58 miles.\nThanks for getting us there must go to all\nconcerned, especially the Jez and Clem crews\nwho helped to get Bo' to the start line (and also\nhelped en route) and Dr Crofton for his sterling\nwork as our trailer driver and general mentor for\nthe event. To all who were there - it was great to\nsee you. To those who weren't, we hope to see\nyou next year, whether you are Guilds, RCS or\nRSM. The Brighton Run is something you will\n(clich e!) remember for the rest of your life.\nThe Boat Club entered a smaller than usual team\nfor the Fullers Brewery Four Head of the River,\nfour and a half miles from Mortlake to Putney.\nA very strong headwind in the middle of the\nrace caused big margins to separate crews.\nConsidering that three of the seven IC entries\nhad been re-shuffled in the last week, our results\nwere encouraging.\nThe best performances were by the women's lightweight four (pictured in Felix 977) who\nwere the fastest women overall finishing\nstrongly in 101st place. The college senior II\ncox less four, who finished 22nd out of the 500\ncrews, won their division by a massive margin\nalso beating all the senior I crews and were the\nsixth placed sweep-oared boat. The college\nsenior I cox less were denied their pennant by a disastrous crash in the final minute.\nOverall, the college performed well with four\ncrews in the top 50, posting their intentions for\nthe coming season after the recent heavy\nnational (and student) press coverage of Bill\nMason's coaching achievements.\nResults in short:\n17th IC I Quad Senior 2 Scull (4th)22 nd IC V Senior 2 Coxless 4 (Winners)\n28th IC II Quad Senior 2 Scull (7th)49 th IC III Senior 1 Coxed 4 (2nd)79 th Queen's Tower II Senior 3 Coxed 4 (3rd)80 th IC IV Senior 1 Coxless 4 (3rd)101 st Queen's Tower I Women's Open Coxless\n4 (Winners)\nSports results deadline is 8pm on Wednesday\n\n"

Although your opinion of\nbeing careful with money does you credit, I do\nobject to your reference of purchasing musical\nequipment as 'frittering money away'. Any\nhobby is worthwhile to the person concerned,\nalthough other people may not be able to\nunderstand spending time and money on a particular pursuit, they must recognise that\nentertainment takes many forms and has\ndifferent values to people.\nAs a person very into clubs and societies, I can perfectly understand the motivation that\npeople have towards their chosen activity. Some\nactivities do cost a lot of money and it is\nnecessary in a lot of cases to buy equipment you\nneed before you can indulge. One person may\nconsider spending money as unnecessary, but I think that anyone would agree that you cannot\nput a price tag on entertainment.\nYours anonymously,\nThe Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies)\nDear Beccy,\nIt is definitely one of the 'most looked\nforward to' events of the year at Imperial\nCollege. But I am afraid to say that this year it\njust hasn't lived up to the expectations placed\nupon it from the previous years. I am talking\nabout the '94 Rag Mag.\nFrom the first reading I was seriously not\nimpressed. What happened to an amusing cover?\nWhat happened to the sexist, racist and general\nslag off everyone jokes. I don't think the\npolitical climate can be blamed for such a lack\nof jokes that make IC Rag Mag the best in\nBritain. There is no \"This is offensive\" warning\non the front page, the start of the downfall? Then\nwhat happened to the offensive pull out section?\nThe dead baby jokes? The 'have to be included'\nhomosexual jokes? Talking about old\njokes...why so many, if they were the funny ones\nI may have let you off, but they are the 'not at\nall funny' old jokes. Don't you think that the\nEssex girl books published about two years ago\nDear Editor,\nI am spending my first year as a student in\nLondon, studying for an MSc. Having applied\nfor accommodation in the student halls, I was\ntold that as a student from the EEC I was\nunlikely to obtain satisfaction. In September\nhaving had no response from the\naccommodation office, I rang them only to learn\nthat all available accommodation had been\nallocated to students of a higher priority. By\nthen, finding private accommodation within my\nbudget proved very difficult, as it was already\ncoining to mid-September.\nOn starting my course I learned that a classmate of mine who's permanent address is\nalong with the Sun newspaper may have just\ncovered all the possible combinations of Essex\ngirl jokes. Even as late as 1982 we were still\nprinting holocaust jokes, but then we can't oppress the Jews for too long, I suppose they\nmight get offended.\nSeeing the editors of the mag are women,\nperhaps the fact that most women tend to act\npolitically correct and go on lovely marches\nthrough London for a worthwhile cause, acted\nagainst their ability to include some more of the\nmore offensive jokes.\nI am sure that this years Rag Mag will sell as\nwell as last years, but how will this edition affect\nfuture years when some good (racist, sexist, slag\nthem all off) jokes are included. I sincerely hope\nthe laugh ability of future mags will\nautomatically bring an increase in sales and so\nmore money for charity.\nYours not laughing at all,\nFrank Poole\nP.S. No Islamic jokes at all, what is going on?\nless than one hour from Imperial is living in the\nSouth Ealing estate (Clayponds Hall). What's more, since the beginning of term and to this\nday, this hall is filled to only approximately 70%\nof its capacity.\nIt appears to me that the Accommodation\nOffice is run in a rather unprofessional manner.\nFurthermore, would the Accommodation Office\nplease explain why they turned me (and many\nothers no doubt) down, only to end up with\nspare rooms in some halls; also, would they\nplease clarify the logic behind their selection\nprocess.\nA frustrated student, paying \u00a370/week for\nprivate accommodation, (name & dept supplied)\nHypnosis Hiccup\nDear Beccy,\nI would like to make an apology and an\nexplanation to everyone who came to the\nHypnosis event on Tuesday 9th November. I'm sorry that the start of the event was delayed by\n45 mins. This was due to the considerably late\narrival of Geno Washington himself for which\nwe got no explanation or apology. He arrived at\n8pm and not at the previously arranged time of\n6.30pm which meant that we hadn't been able to\nperform all the necessary sound checks and\nprevious arrangements that normally proceed\nbefore an event begins. Therefore I'd like to\napologise for any inconvenience caused by the\nlate starting and ending of the event and I hope\nthat everyone had a most enjoyable evening.\nI would also like to extend a very large\nthanks to everyone who helped on the evening,\nand I know that Steve from I.C. Radio would\nendorse these thanks, especially to Andy Nu and\nhis Dramsoc Crew, B.J., Andy Kerr and all the\nother Ents people who helped, Rob from I.C. Radio for the Disco and to everyone else helped\non the night.

Again, as with his other films, Spielberg\nhas excelled himself again and Michael\nLantieri's special effects really need to be seen\non the big screen to be appreciated. All in all, a great evening out.\nThis week's 'Chairman's Choice' is a bit of a mystery.

    "content": "News 3\nRoyal Society report snubs honours classification New Shops\nEx-Rector Calls for Changes\nBY MICHAEL INGRAM\nStudent funding must undergo a far-reaching review if targets for higher\neducation are to be met, according\nto a report by a Royal Society study\ngroup released on Tuesday.\nThe group, chaired by the former\nRector of Imperial College, Sir Eric\nAsh, said that provisions for student\nmaintenance costs should be\nbrought more into line with those in\nother EC countries. This would\ninvolve tightening up means testing\nfor grants and moving towards the\nimposition of graduate taxes or new\nforms of loan. Tuition fees for both\nfull and part-time students would be\npaid by the Government. The\nchanges are intended to make it\neasier for students from lower\n'socio-economic classes' to continue\ntheir education after leaving school.\nUniversities are currently not\nattracting enough students from\nthese groups to meet the target of\none third of young people in higher\neducation by the year 2000.\nThe group also calls for\nsignificant changes to degree\ncourses, including the ending of the\n'honours classification'. In its place,\nstudents would receive a transcript\nof individual results for each course\nmodule taken. An indication of an\noverall standard could then be\ncalculated in the form of some\nweighted average. This system\nwould allow courses to be more\nflexible in adapting to the needs of\nindividual students. The effect that\nthis would have upon the 'value' of\ndegrees from universities with\ndistinguished reputations is not\nmentioned.\nThe report suggests that all\nscience degrees should be modelled\nafter engineering courses by\noffering two courses in each subject.\nThere would be an enhanced four\nyear course for students aspiring to\na career in science, accompanied by\na reduced syllabus three year course\nfor 'general' students.\nThe chairman of the Royal\nSociety's education committee,\nProfessor Roger Blin-Stoyle, said\nthat this would help fulfil the need\nfor civil servants and politicians to\nhave a better understanding of\nscience.\nRecommendations made about\nthe academic teaching of science\ninclude a greater emphasis on\nteaching performance when\nconsidering recruitment and\npromotion. Research students\nshould play a greater part in\nteaching as assistants, according to\nthe report.\nCommenting on IC Radio,\nProfessor Blin-Stoyle said that\nscience courses which are 'more\nuseful in the real world' must be\nmade available.\nBY JOE MCFADDEN\nA new look for the Sherfield\nwalkway should be ready after\nChristmas, according to ICU President, Andrew Wensley.\nPlans to improve services on the\nwalkway by opening a new shop\nunit have now been approved. The\nManagement Planning Group, the\ntop advisory body of Imperial\nCollege, agreed to the proposals in\na meeting earlier this week. The\nprojected income over the next\nthree years is \u00a360,000. However,\nthe Union is expected to spend\n\u00a325,000 in the first year, paying for\nrefurbishing costs and rent. The\nrent for the other two years of the\nthree year lease will amount to\n\u00a310,000.\nThe walkway unit will be leased\nfrom the College by the Union. The\nimmediate plan is to sublet the\nlarger, newly-built premises to a relocated STA Travel office. This\nwould leave the current office\nvacant. Union officials are currently\ndeciding who will fill this space.\nSpeaking to Felix, Mr Wensley\nsaid, \"This will brighten up a rather\ndrab part of the walkway.\"\n1 \\\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

    "content": "Reviews\nIII III Gate, Gate\nby Andrew Nickolds\nand Richard Stoneman\nBeware of books that use silly quotes to\nadvertise themselves! Gate, Gate is one such\nbook. Thus we find that Halley described it as\n\"No comet\" and that King Harold considered it\n\"better than a poke in the eye with a sharp\nstick\". The book, it must be said, is based on\nsound premises: to discover the great inter-connected ness between 'Somethingorothergates'.\nWe begin with 'Hawking-gate', a reflection\non space, time and the brain behind it all. Via\nApplegate (what was Eve really doing?),\nWatergate (hardly avoidable) and Hoovergate (a cunning new theory, linking Kennedy's assassination with a famous make of vacuum\ncleaner), we reach the climax, 'Thatchergate'.\nBy using a mixture of spoof newspaper\ncuttings, imaginary taped dialogues, and\nfabricated evidence, the authors give us a refreshing and witty vision of history's major\nevents. Or maybe not. Unfortunately Gate, Gate\nis another one of these books that will invariably\nend up in your toilet because, having been\nunable to cope with it in one go, you will\nattempt to read it whilst answering the call of\nnature, bit by bit, chapter by chapter and,\nessentially, crap by crap.\nIt is not that the book is fundamentally bad, it\nis just not good; a collection of unrelated\nchapters that fail to be more than rib-tickle rs and\ncome short of satire. Maybe worth a look at...\nbut only in someone else's loo.\nOliver Cow.\nPublished by Pan Books\nPrice: \u00a34.99.\nTom and the\nIsland of\nDinosaurs\nby Ian Beck\nCan you think of a single marketable product\nthat hasn't exploited the wave of 'dino mania' that has been sweeping the world? No? Well, I don't think anyone's failed to notice it unless\nthey're completely deaf, dumb, blind and\nhibernate from January to January.\nThis seemingly innocent book is yet another\nploy to confuse vulnerable youngsters of these\nlong-extinct reptile predecessors of ours. The\nbook subtly suggests that two little kids were the\nsaviours of \"the last dinosaurs of the whole\nworld\" when they cleverly rescue them from a volcanic eruption. What it doesn't say is\nwhether the event was pre-Jurassic Park or post.\nBut for this annoying attribute of the story\nline, this hardback will be much loved by all\nthose who have a dormant adventurer lurking\nwithin them. Ian Beck is a spl end if oro us illustrator who matches that talent with literary\nsimplicity. The magnificent illustrations are\nenough in themselves to tell the story without\nthe text (also excellent). The true spirit of high\nadventure is captured by the consistent use of\ndeep yet realistic colours. Thoroughly\nrecommended as a present for that irresistibly\ncute little cousin, nephew or niece, though\nyou'll need to save up a few weeks in advance.\nZiegler\nPublished by: Doubleday\nPrice: \u00a38.99 (hardback)\ni The Deal\nby Peter Lefcourt\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen may I present the latest\n$30 million blockbuster from award winning\nproducer Charlie Burns: Bill and Ben - William\nGladstone and Benjamin Disraeli and protective\ntariffs in England in the 1870s( the movie).\"\nNo, doesn't sound very likely does it? But\nthis hysterical book goes into the making of this\nworld famous screenplay. Okay, so the plot\nchanges a little during rewrites, such that\nDisraeli is played by the current Schwartz-his name again lookalike and ends up being shot in\nYugoslavia (some very definitely politically\nincorrect jokes about Bosnians and Serbs made\nin the process), but made it is...\nRead the book. It's funny, contains what\nmust be the 'chic-est' suicide attempt on record\n(involving a Mercedes 560 SEL and Eine Kleine\nNachtmusik) and makes very little sense the\nwhole way through.

Hubris, and many,\nmany others.\nIt's pulp, gets a little tedious towards towards\nthe end, is typically overpriced at \u00a34.99 for a paperback but is a rollicking good read. \"I couldn't put it down\", as the actress said to the\nbishop.\nM.J. Published by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nSin\nby Josephine Hart\nTo say that Sin is an obsessive, civilised tale of\nhatred within a middle class family would be an\nunderstatement. In the style of Damage,\ncalamitous events result from jealousy and lust.\nElizabeth is the favourite daughter of her\nadoptive Aunt and Uncle. Ruth is their natural\nchild who grows up with an intense, jealous\nhatred of the \"golden\" Elizabeth. \"First born but\nnot the first child\" is her impetus to invade and\ndestroy her sister's life. All else is secondary,\nincluding career and a suffering husband. Only\nthe reader is privileged to glimpse Ruth's terrifying, disturbed psyche.\nFreak accidents force a situation whereby\nRuth is able to inflict pain. This she does,\nsatisfying her briefly, until fate deals a severe\nretribution. Henceforth, we enter a collapsing\nworld destined for ultimate tragedy.\nWith Sin, Hart shows a mastery of\nminimalist ic yet elegant prose determined ly preying on the voyeuristic tendency that resides\nin all of us.

    "content": "Reviews 7\nPipers Who Call The T\\ me\nThe Docklands Sinfonietta are playing three fresh and different programmes\nin the Queen Elizabeth Hall this month, under the baton of conductor Sian\nEdwards. Patrick Wood talks to her about concert-giving in the capital.\nSian Edwards, Music Director of the English National Opera\nAt first glance, London, with its five major\nsymphony orchestras, seems in rude musical\nhealth. But the Arts Council thinks differently\nand is going ahead with plans to withdraw\nfunding from two of them. The Philharmonia,\nRoyal Philharmonic and London Philharmonic\norchestras have submitted bids to a committee\nwho will select a winner to receive an increased\ngrant. For the other two there will be nothing.\nThe reasoning is that there is no longer a broad enough audience base to support all these\norchestras and the cut-throat competition\nprevents any one orchestra reaching the\nstandards of the Berlin or the Vienna\nPhilharmonic. While this may sound like an\nattempt to give an acceptable face to a cost-cutting exercise, a disappointing lack of variety\nin the programming of recent seasons (the BBC\nSymphony excepted) begs the question of\nwhether London concert-goers are really getting\nfive orchestras' worth of repertoire.\nLater this month, Sian Edwards, best known\nas Music Director of the English National Opera,\nconducts the Docklands Sinfonietta in three\nconcerts which contains more interesting music\nthan some other orchestras manage in a year.\nEdwards offers a plausible explanation for\nthe current homogeneity of many concert\nprogrammes: \"Now we have such wide access to\nmass media of all types, it's more clear perhaps what\npieces people will buy and what they won't, whereas\nin Brahms' lifetime, people were less aware in South\nGermany what someone in North Germany was\nwriting. It's a phenomenon of the 20th century\nthat serious classical music has split off from the\nmainstream and become a thing in itself.\"\nThe resulting exclusion of people from all but\na small number of classical pieces is something\nwhich calls for longer-term measures than the\nplanned orchestral cull: \"I know that the\norchestras themselves have very strong\neducation projects going and have done an\nenormous amount of work in sending their\nplayers to schools and trying to make a whole\nscene of classical music more user-friendly. It's not just a problem of having five orchestras all\nchasing a tiny audience.\"\nThe forthcoming Docklands Sinfonietta\nconcerts feature works such as Takemitsu's Tree\nLine, Berg's Violin Concerto, Kurt Weill's Second Symphony, and Lutoslawski's lyrical\nmodern masterpiece, Chantefleurs et\nChantefables. But doesn't the fact that the\norchestra is entirely privately funded put more\npressure on the conductor to choose a marketable programme? Edwards feels that the\nflexibility of the freelance Docklands players\nallows them to target more adventurous concert-goers. \"Because we don't play all the time, we\nonly get together for specific concerts at certain\ntimes. We're able to tap into that particular\naudience. So what we're doing are works which\ninterest the orchestra at the moment. It's a very\nexciting time for us because in the middle of\nthese concerts we're taking two programmes to\nthe Wien Modern Festival, and that had some\nbearing on the works that we chose because the\nFestival is featuring Takemitsu.\"\nThe third concert, with its Lutoslawski and\nSzymanowski, fits nicely into the BBC Polish\nSeason and, in the second concert, another\nPolish composer, Penderecki, provides the only\nreally uncompromising dose of modernity with\nhis Intermezzo, six minutes of fascinating, hair-raising quarter-tone slithering s and spiky\nrhythms for 24 strings.\nPenderecki's later tonal style and the post-minimalism of Gorecki, among others, seem to\nbe doing something to counteract the indifference felt by audiences in general towards\ncontemporary music. Edwards believes that this\nfeeling of alienation \"is a problem that people\nneed to address, but not by writing works\nbecause they want to get an audience in. Each\none must go in their own direction, but I do\nthink it's interesting that people feel they have to\ngo back to a tonal centre to reaffirm their\nmusical beliefs.\" Cautiously: \"I don't find\nanything wrong with that, intrinsically. Whether\nyou like the music or not is another matter.\"\nEdwards prefers to woo her audience by\nsubtler means, once remarking that she would\nlike her concerts to have more of the ambience\nof, say, a jazz club. \"Yes - the worst thing I think\ncan happen is that people come and feel that\nthey're almost afraid to be human. I really do\nlike it when an audience feels they can be\nrelaxed, that they don't have to sit rigidly in their\nseats and 'appreciate' the music as if it was\nsome kind of product being put out that they\ncan't have a response to there and then. They've\njust got to take it in as high culture. I think all\nthat is very stultifying. I love it when audiences\nare fresh and they respond; in the opera house\nthey laugh, they cry, that's what it's all about.\nAnd I think that if an audience really does have a sense of excitement and elation at the end of a concert, that's wonderful and I really hope that\npeople feel they can respond in that way.\"\nFuture plans include Jan&c ek and Berlioz,\nboth on the stage and in the concert hall, as well\nas a continued commitment to new repertoire.\n\"I'm interested in doing new music and hope I 'll\ncontinue to do that. I think Britain has a huge\ngroup of interesting and talented composers at\nthe moment.\"\nHopefully, there are also enough interested\nand adventurous concert-goers and sponsors to\nensure that the new and the different continue to\nhave a place on London's concert platforms.\nThe Docklands Sinfonietta, sponsored by\nMorgan Stanley International, are at the Queen\nElizabeth Hall at 7.45 pm on the 16th,23 rd and\n26th of November. Box Office (071) 928 8800.\nThe author gratefully acknowledges the\nassistance of Neil Bond of IC Radio in carrying\nout this interview.\nA review of The Concierge is on page 11\n\n"
