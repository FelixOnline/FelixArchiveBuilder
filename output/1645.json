The pork t-bone\nwas another of my favour-ites, with slices of succulent,\njuicy pork on top of perfectly\ncooked rainbow chard and\nPortobello mushrooms,\nsaturated with the wonderful\njuices from the pork and the\ndrizzling of gravy.\nDessert, or should I say\ndolci, is the course all ladies\nlook forward to in a meal,\nand this was no exception\ndespite our near-exploding\nstomachs by the end of the\nsecondi. It was an attractive\nplatter of tiramisu, a baked\nI\nt\u2019s not every day you\nmeet a Michelin-star\nchef. Not hysterically\nscreaming after catching\na glimpse some 50-metres\naway, but to be within\ntalking distance, and most\nimportantly, taking a selfie.\nAll thanks to the cohort of\nlovely PRs, one such event\nfilled up the Saturday afternoon rectangle in my black\nMoleskine diary last week,\nmuch to the envy of my peers.\nThe unfinished problem sheets\ngot pushed to the bottomless\nblack hole in the back of\nmy mind, and off I went to a\npasta making master-class\nat Theo\u2019s Simple Italian, a\nnew restaurant tucked on the\nground floor of Hotel Indigo,\na stone\u2019s throw from Earl\u2019s\nCourt tube station.\nTheo Randall was a\nwell-respected head chef at\nThe River Caf\u00e9 for over 15\nyears, earning a Michelin\nstar for the restaurant, then\nleaving to launch his own\nrestaurant, Theo Randall at\nthe Intercontinental in 2006.\nTheo now also serves as the\nCulinary Director at Theo\u2019s\nSimple Italian. The restaurant\nalso commits to inspire diners\nto recreate the simple Italian\nfood at home, featuring an\nItalian deli selling seasonal\nproduce, fine ingredients and\nartisan products.\nWhere was I? Yes, crossing\nthe road in my stiff navy\nduffle coat, and up the steps\ninto the classy yet relaxed\natmosphere, adorned by\nmarble tables, leather chairs\nand warm ceiling lights. I\nentered the spacious private\nroom, and was greeted by a\nfew familiar blogger faces, a\nglass of prosecco and Theo\nRandall himself, chatting\ncheerily in the corner.\nThe master class started\nsoon after the introduction.\nWe were led to a cosy area\ntucked in the back of the\nroom. A wooden table stood\non one side, with a few ingredients plus a shiny table top\npasta machine clamped firmly\non top. Theo unwrapped the\nbright yellow pasta dough\nhe had prepared beforehand while telling us stories\nof his experiences in Italy,\nhow ricotta is made and\nhis special pasta recipe. He\nsat ourselves along the long\ntables, ready to be served\nthe new four-course brunch\nmenu. An antipasti platter,\nstarring 4 types of cured\nmeats from Naples, Piedmont,\nand Florence, and a glossy\nglobe of Apulian burrata on\na bed of rocket and roasted\ncherry tomatoes was shared\namongst four along with some\nsoft rosemary and sea salt\nfocaccia. The 3 pasta dishes\nfor primi aroused excitement\nacross the tables as we saw\nthe fresh pasta made during\nthe demonstration served\nbefore us. The ravioli, filled\nwith a creamy light ricotta\nand rainbow chard, was\ncooked and tossed in a simple\nsage butter. The wide ribbons\nof papparadelle came coated\nwith a full-bodied beef ragout\nand was quickly distributed\naround the table. The third,\nwas the Taglierini Pascatore \u2013\ngenerous portions of mussels,\nclams, prawns and fish in\ntomato sauce surrounded\nthe fine laces of pasta, which\nsoaked up the strong fishy\nflavours from the seafood,\nperhaps too strong for a few\non my table but was essential\nto become my favourite dish\nout of all three.\nThe secondi also featured 3\ndishes. The Tagliata di Manzo\nwas a chargrilled bavette\nof beef, served in slices that\nreveal the beautiful, juicy,\npink, medium-rare meat with\na dressed hedge of peppery\nrocket, borlotti beans and\nroasted cherry tomatoes. The\nfish dish starred a portion\nof sea bream, with its skin\npan fried to a crispy golden\nyellow, served with roasted\ntomatoes and delicious\ncolourful strips of grilled\nChristy Lam\n\\\\ Generous portions of mussels,\nclams, prawns and\nfish in tomato sauce\nsurrounded the fine\nlaces of pasta \\\\\n\\\\ Once clay-like\ndough magically\ntransformed into\na thin spread of\nsmooth silk, which\nwas swiftly cut into\na handful of thread-like taglierini \\\\\nrolled out the dough in the\nmachine, folded and rolled\nout again and again. His\nhand was constantly on the\nhandle, turning as quickly as\na turbine. The once clay-like\ndough magically transformed\ninto a thin spread of smooth\nsilk, which was swiftly cut\ninto a handful of thread-like\ntaglierini. The rest of the\ndough was made into ravioli,\nlike soft cushions resting on\nthe green cutting board.\nAfter a round of amazed\ngasps and questions, we\nricotta cheesecake and soft\nchocolate cake with a scoop\nof vanilla gelato. The tiramisu\nwas amazing \u2013 a fellow\nblogger even described it to\nbe better than her mother\u2019s.\nThe cheesecake, baked rather\nthan fridge-set, was light and\nmellow in flavour, pairing\nwell with the strips of pear on\ntop. The chocolate cake was\npure indulgence \u2013 rich, dense\nand moist, almost like a fudge\ncake.\nThis brunch menu was\ntruly satisfying for the taste\nbuds and the stomach. The\ndishes, from antipasti all\nthe way through to dolci,\nmaintained the simplicity\nand authentic flavours from\nItaly, and brought out the\nbest from the top-quality\ningredients. Just fuss-free,\ndelicious food reflecting\nTheo and his team\u2019s expertise\nand effort, supported by a\nbeautiful, chilled-out setting\nand wonderful service. Highly\nrecommended.\n\n"

    "content": "14 felixonline.co.uk/science fsci@ic.ac.uk Friday 4 November 2016\nfelix S C I E N C E\nChoice Award, where people\ncan vote online for one of\nthe 25 images of the selected\nshortlist if you want to get\ninvolved in judging some of\nthe images yourself. Personally I\u2019m rooting for an image\nof a kingfisher diving into the\nwater entitled The Blue Trail.\nComing out of this visual\njourney, it\u2019s difficult not to\nurge everyone to check out\nthe WPY exhibition sometime\nover the next year. It\u2019s easy,\nwhat with it being so close to\ncampus, to take the Natural\nHistory Museum for granted,\nbut the exhibition is a great\nreminder of how successful the NHM is at instilling\na sense of wonder into its\nvisitors. While it\u2019s true that\nmost of the winning images\nare available to view online,\nthe experience of seeing them\ndisplayed in a room devoid of\ndistractions is really unique.\nWith the rest of the South\nKensington area being so\nloud in the holiday season,\nspending a couple hours of\nyour day focused on these\nimages is a welcome break.\nThe exhibition tickets range\nfrom \u00a36.50-\u00a38 with the\nstudent concession and as\na bonus you get to skip the\nlong entry queues than can\noverwhelm Exhibition Road\nthis time of year. So please\ntake an hour out of your\nschedule to have a wander\nand a wonder.\nT\nucked away in\na quiet corner\nof the Natural\nHistory Museum,\nThe Wildlife\nPhotographer of\nthe Year (WPY) exhibition\nprovides a welcome respite\nfrom the maddening crowds\nthat flood the museum during\nthe holiday season. The\natmosphere changes as soon\nas you walk into the darkened\nroom filled with birdsong,\nand you are presented\nwith a series of illuminated\nphotographs all equally\nstunning and interesting in\ntheir own right.\nNow in its 52nd\nyear, it\u2019s\na joy to report that the\nexhibition is still a beautiful\nand sprawling representation\nof both the natural world\nand the skill of these elite\nphotographers. The gallery\nis sectioned into the different\ncategories of the competition\nand further sub sectioned\naccording to either animal\ngroup, or global habitat. The\nwell-lit, large photographs\nare aligned consecutively\naround the room, allowing\ncontemplative observation as\nyou make your way through\nthe exhibition. Each image\nrightly takes its place as a\nfinalist by acting as a glorious\nrepresentation of the natural\nworld. Helpfully there is also\nan extensive caption beneath\neach image, describing how\nthe photo was taken from\na technical standpoint, but\nalso providing context about\nthe animal and environment\ndepicted in the image. There\u2019s\na broad range of subjects and\nenvironments on display, with\nphotos from suburban London\nto the coastline of Cape Town,\nnot only showing visitors\nthe extraordinary but also\nmaking the everyday appear\nextraordinarily beautiful.\nDespite the wealth of talent\ndisplayed here, interestingly\nsome of the winning images\nmay seem inferior to other\nfinalists. It quickly becomes\nclear that the panel rewards\nphotographers for technical\nskill and an interesting sub-ject, in addition to the vivid\ncolouration and composition\nof the photo. Since photographers all have access\nto outstanding equipment to\nhelp capture the best shots,\na wildlife photo often only\nstands out when the subject is\nexhibiting unusual behaviour,\nor the image really captures\nthe qualities of the habitat in\nshot. Examples of this include\nan image entitled Eviction\nAttempt which shows the\nbizarre scenario of a parakeet on the wing attempting\nto haul a monitor lizard out\nof the bird\u2019s nest, by its tail.\nThe amphibians, reptiles and\nfish category truly epitomised\nhow the photos were judged,\nwith the winning photo of\na terrapin in the gloom of\na pond, seeming dull and\nuninteresting to the neutral\neye, when compared to some\nof the other finalists. However,\nthe technical skill involved in\nreflecting the dark nature of\nthe pond whilst still achieving\nclarity of subject is outstand-ing, and it naturally hasn\u2019t\ngone unnoticed by the judges.\nThis is further reflected\nin a shot called Alley Cat,\npicturing a leopard skulking\nthrough the side streets of\nMumbai. Usually in such a\ndark environment, the requirement is a wide aperture,\nslow shutter and high ISO\nto allow in maximum light,\nyet the photographer used\na low flash to illuminate the\nsubject with great clarity,\nwhile preserving the gloom of\nthe alleyway. This artistic skill\nis apparent throughout the\nexhibition, with shutter speed\nadjustment, aperture setting,\nand flash control, all contributing to a wealth of shots that\nappear more painting than\nphotograph, and present the\nnatural world in an almost\notherworldly light. In a world\nof social media, where every\nphoto taken is highly edited\nand filtered, the beauty of\nthese unedited images is even\nmore impressive.\nIt seems odd then that\nwith all this equipment and\ntechnical ability presented by\nthe photographers, that the\nwinning shot was taken with a\ngoPro camera, displayed high\nin a fig tree, and controlled\nremotely. Winner Tim Lanam,\nwho has won the contest\nbefore, presents an orangutan struggling up the tree\nin search of fruit, high above\nthe canopy. It\u2019s a fantastically\nclever shot, reflecting the\neffort invested by the animal,\nwhilst also providing a\nwindow into the world of a\nnow severely endangered\ngreat ape, whose habitat displayed in the photograph is\nseverely under threat. It also\nfollows a growing trend in the\nmajor award winners across\nall categories, with images\ndepicting animals struggling\nagainst urbanisation, pollution and habitat destruction\nbeing the most successful\nawards-wise. For example\nthe winner of the Wildlife\nPhotojournalist Award: Single\nImage is a deeply harrowing\npicture of dead pangolins, the\nword\u2019s most trafficked animal\nfor medicine and luxury food.\nOne the strongest aspects of\nthe exhibition is the acknowledgement of how humans\nhave impacted the lives of\nthese beautiful creatures.\nA section in the centre of\nthe room is dedicated to the\nYoung Wildlife Photographer\nof the Year contest with an\narray of photos taken by\namateurs aged 11-17. These\nphotos, while generally not\nas serious in subject matter\nas some of the others, are not\nany less breathtaking. The\ngrand title winner The Moon\nand the crow is one of the\nmost stunning photos in the\nexhibition and it\u2019s a struggle\nto believe that someone\nunder ten one of the winning\nimages of a chiffchaff. As well\nas the central and junior contests there is also the People\u2019s\nWildlife photographer of the year 2016\nMadeleine Webb and George Brooks pair up to discuss the science and technical skill behind\nthe 52 yearold exhibition and of course, what it takes to bag that coveted a first prize.\nWildlife Photographer of the Year, Urban winner // Nayan Khanolkar\n\n"

There wasn\u2019t one. No\none complained, we received no angry letters,\nphone calls or emails. No one cared. Which\nproves our point. Nipples aren\u2019t a big deal and\nthough we still have a lot of work to do towards gender\nequality, maybe, just maybe we\u2019re slowly getting there.\nIronically, this week, it seems there\u2019s a heated\nconversation going on regarding consent training\nbecause Imperial has spent \u00a35,000 on licensing an\nonline consent training course. But while there are those\nwho view it as a gross misallocation of resources, I\u2019m\nsure victims of sexual abuse will disagree. Especially\nconsidering we\u2019ve had two testimonials of sexual abuse\nin the paper this year already.\nThe conversation on gender equality is constantly\nexpanding. Who knows \u2013 maybe next week we\u2019ll have\nanother female world leader? Or maybe the next US\nPresident will resemble an overcooked baked bean\nwith a Pomeranian glued on its head. We\u2019ll know for\nsure after Tuesday (probably).\nFor now, we\u2019ve tried to provide some content that\nmight clue you in on the US presidential election\nrace.

On\nthe face of it, the\npurpose of satirical news is\nto reflect the headlines, draw\nhumour from what seems\noften to be ever deepening\npit of despair. \u2018Look up, do\nyou see it? Way up therethat\u2019s rock bottom,\u2019 remarked\nJohn Oliver a few weeks\nago on Last Week Tonight in\nresponse to the latest Trump\nscandal.\nIn America, comedy news\nshows have evolved from a\nplatform for clever jokes to\nan increasingly impassioned\ncloser look at the state of the\ncountry and its affairs. More\nthan the actual news, liberal\ncomedy has become the bastion of progressive debate.\nThis shift may well be the\nlegacy of Jon Stewart, who\nduring his 16 year reign at\nthe helm of The Daily Show,\nmade his mantra on bullshit:\n\u2018If you smell something, say\nsomething.\u2019\nSeveral of the comedians\nwho have taken up the mantle\nof activism through comedy\nstarted their careers on The\nDaily Show under Stewart\u2019s\ntutelage. Samantha Bee is\none such comedian. When\nJon Stewart retired earlier\nthis year, Bee, who had been\na long time correspondent\non the show, was for many,\none of the favourites to fill the\nposition. She quashed any\nhopes that she might take\nover by choosing to create\nher own show, and it may\nwell prove to be the best decision of her career.\nFull Frontal With Samantha\nBee is a show built in The\nBee is akin to listening to\nyour smartest, funniest, more\neloquent friend rant about\nthe election. It\u2019s not gag-a-minute, but it rings truer,\nand hits harder than overly\npolished puns.\nFull Frontal often goes\nbeyond the headlines to\nfind local stories and wider\ncontext issues. Over the\nprevious weeks, Bee has\ntackled the rise of the AltRight, the descent of the\nGOP into the clutches of its\nTea Party extremist, she has\ntackled abortion laws, gun\nrights, LGBTQ, and the hold\nof the church over healthcare.\nShe tackles these issues with\nvehemence, and a clarity of\npurpose that goes beyond\ntrying to get some laughs in.\nThere is a sense that Bee\nwants to make a difference,\na desire to engage the disenfranchised young people\nwho want to get involved\nbut don\u2019t always know all\nthe facts, and not just be an\necho chamber for liberals.\nThis desire to be better than\nher predecessors extends\nto behind the scenes. Bee\nemploys the greatest proportion of female writers of any\nof the comedy shows, and has\nmade efforts to amplify the\nvoices of her minority writers\nrather than package and\npresent their views herself.\nIn a segment dealing with\nBlack History Month, it was\nwriter Ashley Black, not Bee,\nwho rubbished the white\nconservatives that use Dr.\nMartin Luther King Jr\u2019s \u2018I have\na Dream\u2019 speech to justify \u2018all\nlives matter\u2019. She also called\nfor \u2018Black Now Month\u2019, a\nmonth in which we celebrate\nThe new faces of satire\n\\\\ She is keen to\nstep out of John\nStewart\u2019s shadow\nand create the\nequivalent of Nicki\nMinaj\u2019s \u2018Pinkprint\u2019 as\nopposed to Jay-Z\u2019s\n\u2018Blueprint\u2019 \\\\\nDaily image, the original\nliberal satirical news behe-moth. Yet, in hosting Full\nFrontal, Bee has become\nthe first woman to host a\nlate night comedy show in\nAmerica. She is keen to step\nout of Jon Stewart\u2019s shadow\nand create the equivalent of\nNicki Minaj\u2019s \u2018Pinkprint\u2019 as\nopposed to Jay Z\u2019s \u2018Blueprint\u2019\nif you will. At the beginning\nof each episode, Bee strides\nonto the stage in statement\nblazers and skinny jeans like\na punk rock Angela Merkel\nto the sounds of \u2018Boys Wanna\nBe Her\u2019. Then, instead of\nsitting behind a desk, she\nstays standing for the whole\nhalf hour. This is a superficial difference but belies a\nmore profound one. A sense\nof urgency and anger runs\nthrough Full Frontal; where\nothers shows quip with a deft\nlightness, exasperated at the\npolitical scene\u2019s descent into\nlunacy, Bee attacks. Watching\nthe work and lives of black\nactivists and heroes alive\ntoday, rather than ruminate\non an imagined sixties.\nThe 2000 elections, with all\nits twists and turns, and the\nBush presidency that followed\nproved the making of Jon\nStewart. This election, with\nits twists ripped straight from\nShonda Rimes\u2019 most fevered\nimaginings, is proving the\nmaking of Samantha Bee.\nHers is a voice that is all too\nrare in both comedy and pol-itics: a fiercely liberal, angry,\nsarcastic, and unapologeti-cally feminist voice.\nThis week Bee interviewed\nBarack Obama and travelled\nto Russia to interview two\ninternet trolls employed by\nthe Russian state to spread\npro-Russian messages across\nvarious internet platforms\nwhilst pretending to be\nvarious characters including\n\u2018a housewife from Nebraska\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a testament to Bee\u2019s vision\nand intent that she has been\nable to make so much of her\nshow in its freshman run, as\nwell as an indictment of the\nAmerican news stations that\nseem to be lagging far behind\ntheir parody counterparts in\ndelivering cutting edge journalistic content.\nIf informing voters is a\ntall task for a satirical news\nshow, surely it can\u2019t be done\nby a sketch show? Saturday\nNight Live, though broadly\nliberal, has never held any\ngrand political ambitions.\nYet, consistently, its political\nimpressions have shaped the\ncultural landscape.\nLegendary amongst them is\nTina Fey\u2019s caricature of Sarah\nPalin during the 2008 election\ncycle, which cemented Palin\u2019s\npublic image as a woman\nclearly out of her depth and\nmanifestly unfit to be put in\ncharge of anything, much less\nthe country.\nAmy Poehler portrayed\nHillary Clinton in 2008. Poehler\u2019s Clinton was the straight\nman to the constellation of\neccentric characters that\nswirled around her, adept\nBaldwin\u2019s Trump defending\nthe Access Hollywood tape\nto Clinton HQ. McKinnon as\nClinton is swigging from a\nchampagne bottle, and trying\nvery hard to seem sober\nand horrified rather than\noverjoyed at this new turn\nof events. She addresses the\nwomen voting for Trump; \u2018My\nbabies, \u2018ya brain broke. Bish,\nI love ya, but you cray.\u2019 This\nis a tender portrait of Clinton,\nMcKinnon has confessed\nshe finds Clinton \u2018resplendent\u2019. That is not to say the\nportrayal has no teeth; in\none sketch, Clinton, in order\nto win the youth vote begins\nto speak and act like Bernie\nSanders all the while claiming\nshe\u2019s been saying it all for\nyears, in each transition\nmorphing into him a little bit\nmore. She ends the speech as\na white haired Jewish man in\na baggy suit. \u2018Vote for me,\u2019\nsays Hillary, \u2018I can be whoever you want me to be.\u2019\nAs anyone who witnessed\nMcKinnon\u2019s turn as Jillian\nHoltzmann in The Ghostusters reboot will know, it is\nalmost impossible to watch\nKate McKinnon and not be\ncharmed.\nMcKinnon won an Emmy\nearlier this year, and thanked\nHillary Clinton in her speech.\nIf all goes accordingly for\nClinton, on November 8th\nshe\nmay well thank McKinnon,\nwho has achieved what no\nPR manager has managed to\n\\\\ That is not to say\nthe portrayal has no\nteeth; in one sketch,\nClinton, in order to\nwin the youth vote\nbegins to speak and\nact like Bernie Sanders \\\\\nat giving weighted reaction\nglances at the comment.\nKate McKinnon has taken\non the role in the last couple\nof years, and her Clinton\nis an altogether different\nbeast. McKinnon\u2019s Clinton is\npower-crazed, socially inept,\nfrighteningly formal, and\nyet despite all this, endlessly\nendearing; she is allowed\nto be eccentric and slightly\nmad. In one scene stealing\nmoment, Cecily Strong, as a\nnews reporter, cuts from Alec\n\\\\ If informing voters\nis a tall task for a\nsatirical news show,\nsurely it can\u2019t be\ndone by a sketch\nshow \\\\\ndo in 30 years; she has made\nHillary Clinton likeable.\nElections, and this one more\nthan most, will be decided\nby the youth. Young voters\nin America are increasingly\nturned off by the partisan\nbias that inflict most mainstream media news sources.\nInstead, they are turning to\ncomedy shows, YouTube clips,\nand online articles to form\nan opinion. As they do so,\nthey will be influenced by the\nchoices that Bee, McKinnon,\nand comedians like them\nmake.\n\\\\ There is a sense\nthat Bee wants to\nmake a difference,\na desire to engage\nthe disenfranchised\nyoung people \\\\\nThe only true successor to Jon Stewart\u2019s crown \\\\ TBS\nIt\u2019s like looking in a mirror \\\\ NBC\nIndira Malik\n\n"

A slow-motion montage of\nobese elderly women\ndancing, completely\nnaked save for cheerleading\npom-poms and marching\nband hats, ought to do the\ntrick. Nocturnal Animals, the\nlatest feature from fashion-bigwig-turned-film-director\noften serves to be mocked\nby filmmakers who wish to\nappear avant-garde; when\nSusan accidentally breaks\nthe phone of one of her\ncolleagues, she\u2019s told not to\nworry \u2013 \u201cthe new one comes\nout next week\u201d. That Ford\nopted for such a vitriolic\nrepresentation of the art\nworld might seem worrying\nto anyone who hasn\u2019t yet\nseen the film, as if he\u2019d spent\napproximately $22 million\nwriting a bitter letter to an ex,\nbut fear not; Nocturnal Animals is a lush, thrilling drama\nthat carries as much narrative\nfocus as it does emotional\nheft, and is a strong testament\nthat as a director, Ford has\nfinally found his true calling.\nFor the first five minutes\nof the film, Susan paces\nlanguidly around her world,\npopulated chiefly by a distant\nsecond husband (Armie\nHammer) and a handful of\nfriends even crazier than\nherself (played in brilliantly\nexaggerated single-scene\nperformances from Andrea\nRiseborough and Michael\nin the film is her mother\n\u2013 another caricature, this\ntime of a racist, misogynistic\nupper-class Texan \u2013 who is\nportrayed with a marvellously\nsteely edge of cynicism and\nbrimstone by Laura Linney.\nThis doesn\u2019t bode well for\nSusan\u2019s situation as a female\nartist in a man\u2019s world. On\ntop of this, Gyllenhaal\u2019s\nreal-life Edward is constantly\nlabelled as \u201cweak\u201d during the\nflashback sequences (a theme\nwhich is heavily reflected in\nthe thriller he has written); as\nmore is revealed about the\nbackstory between Susan\nand Edward, and the fictional\nthriller running parallel to it\nturns more and more sour. In\nfact we are led to question if\nthis novel Edward has written\nis his way of showing her\nthat he is no longer weak, or\nexacting bitter revenge.\nDespite its darkness,\nNocturnal Animals remains\nintriguing and even entertain-ing. Of course it should go\nwithout saying that the film\nis gorgeously shot, proving\nthat Ford has kept his eye\nfor beauty. He also proves\nhimself a startlingly adept\nscreenwriter, with dialogue\nthat drip-feeds exposition in a\nsubtle manner, and manages\na surprisingly large number\nof laughs with a grim sense\nof humour. I hope Susan\nis not his mouthpiece when\nshe refers to her own work\nas \u201cjunk\u201d, as Nocturnal\nAnimals is an excellent piece\nof cinema. It\u2019s clear now that\nhe has found a new lease of\nlife as a director, so here\u2019s to\nhoping he continues to find it\nfor quite some time.\nTom Stephens\nTomFordreturnsafteraseven-year\nabsence with Nocturnal Animals,\na luscious, scintillating thriller\nthat shows off his eye for beauty\n\\\\ Nocturnal\nAnimals is a strong\ntestament that as a\ndirector, Ford has\nfinally found his true\ncalling. \\\\\nSheen). A quiet weekend\nalone at home is interrupted\nby the arrival of a letter from\nher first husband Edward\nSheffield (Jake Gyllenhaal)\nafter a silence of many\nyears, along with a finished\nmanuscript of his latest,\nas-yet-unpublished, novel.\nShe begins to read it and is\nsucked into a dark revenge\nthriller that is played out in\nfull on the screen, in which the\nprotagonist Tony (who Susan\nimagines to be Edward, i.e.\nGyllenhaal) has his family\nabducted during a night drive\nby a gang of young men led\nby Ray (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). As she finishes reading\nthe opening of the novel,\nflashbacks of her time with\nEdward begin to appear, and\nthus the three distinct timelines\nof the film are established.\nOne of Nocturnal Animals\u2019\nmost admirable achievements is that it manages\nto make each storyline as\ngripping as the others. The\ndramatisation of the novel\nthat ostensibly takes place\ninside Susan\u2019s mind is rather\nstraightforward plot-wise, but\nremains absorbing throughout each scene, thanks in\nno small part to a brace of\nvery strong performances.\nTaylor-Johnson is captivating and dastardly as chief\npsycho Ray, and Gyllenhaal\nembodies the character arc of\nTony with perfect believabil-ity, but Michael Shannon\u2019s\nperformance as the detective\nassigned to help Tony find\nhis family, steals every scene\nhe\u2019s in. When his character\ngets up-close-and-personal to\nanother during a monologue\n\u2013 which, enjoyably, occurs\nfrequently \u2013 I could feel that\nthere wasn\u2019t a person in the\ncinema who wasn\u2019t devoting\nthe entirety of their attention\nto him.\nThe \u201creal life\u201d narrative\nstrand, however, has a much\nmore static, melancholic\natmosphere. For better or\nworse, Susan is a character\nwhose own life and decisions\nhave stifled her. Despite her\nsucessful career, it appears to\nbe her husband who brings\nin the cash flow sufficient\nfor sustaining their glamorous lifestyle. The only other\nnotable female character\nAmy Adams, showing art isn\u2019t dead \\\\ FOCUS\nA dark\ndescent\ninto artistic\ndepths\nTom Ford, opens with such\na scene. Though a visual\necho to this opening occurs\nlater in the movie in a brief\nstrip bar scene, its meaning\nis never quite explained.\nThere\u2019s a suggestion that\nthis lack of explanation, or\nlack of meaning, is entirely\nthe point: it\u2019s revealed that\nthis display of dancers is\na new art installation by\nsuccessful gallery owner\nSusan Monrow (Amy Adams),\nand at a dinner a few scenes\nlater she describes her own\ninstallation, with sincere\ndejection, as \u201cjunk\u201d.\nSusan is one of the many\nartists that populate one\nof the multiple storylines of\nNocturnal Animals, and is not\nalone in despising her own\nwork.

Original\nmusicals that manage to\ncreate some sort of cultural\nimpact are an even rarer\nbreed; the musicals that\ndominate Broadway and the\nWest End have been running\nfor eons. Every year, a new\nhost of plays and albums push\nthe boundaries, but a new\nBook of Mormon or Les Mis\ndoesn\u2019t come around every\nday.\nThere must be exceptions\nto every rule; Hamilton has\ncreated such a cultural impact\nin the two short years since\nits off-Broadway debut that\nearlier this year it swept up a\nwhole host of Tonys, and won\na Pulitzer for writer Lin-Manuel Miranda. It\u2019s a favourite\nof the Obamas, countless\nthinkpieces have been written\nabout it, standard tickets are\nsold out in New York until\nsummer 2017, and the few\ntickets that remain are selling\nfor upwards of $700. Why\nhas Hamilton taken the world\nby storm? Is it worth the steep\nprices?\nHamilton began its life as\nthe The Hamilton Mixtape, a\nseries of songs that set the life\nof Alexander Hamilton, an\nAmerican founding father, to\na mix of R&B, rap, and show\ntunes. It sounds like the lesson\nGeneral Washington\u2019s \u2018right\nhand man\u2019, and shape the US\nconstitution after the Revolutionary War, in the process\nbecoming the first Secretary\nof the Treasury. Miranda,\nwho was inspired by Ron\nChernow\u2019s award winning\nbiography of Hamilton, saw\nHamilton\u2019s life as \u201cclassic\nhip-hop narrative\u201d; the story\nof a man born in poverty\nwho makes it to the top of the\nsocial hierarchy through the\npower of his words.\nHamilton\u2019s plot unfolds over\n46 songs, without any dialogue in between. The songs\nare written with an easy\nvirtuosity, melding together\noriginal text with allusions\nto rap, and pop-culture\nreferences. In One Last Time,\nthe song in which George\nHamilton | an ode to America\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ \u201cRap is the\nlanguage of the\nrevolution. Hip-hop\nis the backbeat\u201d \\\\\nplan of a substitute Year nine\nhistory teacher that has just\npassed their PGCE, but from\nthe moment that Lin-Manuel\nMiranda first rapped the\ninitial draft of Alexander\nHamilton, the first song of the\nmusical at the 2009 White\nHouse Poetry Slam, it became\napparent that the concept\nnot only worked, but had\nthe potential to change the\ncultural landscape.\nAlexander Hamilton was\nborn out of wedlock in the\nWest Indies, to a white Caribbean mother, and a Scottish\nfather. His mother died whilst\nhe was young, and he was\nabandoned by his father.\nWhen a hurricane destroyed\nhis hometown, Hamilton, then\n17, wrote a letter describing the devastation it had\nwreaked. When the letter was\npublished in North America,\nit brought aid relief to the\nisland, and gave Hamilton\nthe funds to go to New York\nto study at King\u2019s College\n(now Columbia). There, he\nwould meet other revolution-aries, eventually become\nWashington steps down from\nthe presidency, one of the\nfinal verses quotes verbatim Washington\u2019s farewell\naddress. Hamilton begins\nto speak the words, and\nWashington joins in, singing\nover Hamilton. The harmony\nbetween melody and spoken\nword is a reference to\nwill.i.am\u2019s remix of Obama\u2019s\n2008 \u2018Yes We Can\u2019 speech,\nin which the rapper sings\nover a Obama delivering his\nspeech. In another instance,\nin Helpless, a song in which\nEliza Schuyler meets and falls\nin love with Hamilton, the\nmelody is lifted straight from\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Countdown which\nMiranda considers the \u201cmost\n\\\\ In the 46 songs,\nMiranda melds\ntogether original\nhistorical text with\nrap, and pop culture\nreferences to tie\nhistory to the sound\nof the present \\\\\nPhillippa Soo and Lin Manuel Miranda as Eliza, and Alexander Hamilton (left). Daveed Diggs as Lafayette (right)\n\\\\ instagram.com/hamiltonmusical\nperfect song ever written.\u201d\nIndeed there are so many\nallusions to other works; litera-ture, history, and hip hop that\nMiranda published a several\nhundred page book detailing\nthe different references.\nIn tying history to the sound\nof the present, Miranda joins\na long tradition of writers\nthroughout history who have\nused references the audience\nwill understand as a cultural\nshorthand to set the tone of\nthe work, and underscore\nits message. When the cast\nperformed Hamilton at the\nWhite House, President\nObama remarked that in\nHamilton \u201crap is the language\nof revolution. Hip-hop is the\nbackbeat.\u201d\nHamilton follows the birth\nof the \u2018American experiment\u2019;\nthe revolution against the\noppressive English monarchy,\nand the formation of a new\ngovernment. In the musical,\ndebates in the newly formed\ncabinet are written as rap\nbattles; Washington, the\nPresident acts as the MC, as\nHamilton and Jefferson trade\nbarbs over fiscal policy. In\nanother instance, Daveed\nDiggs as the Marquis de\nLafayette raps with dizzying\nspeed as he enters into\nthe fray of battle\nwith the British forces\nat\nYorktown.\nEarlier this year, as Hamilton rapped \u2018this is not a\nmoment/it\u2019s the movement\u2019,\na slogan intertwined with the\nBlack Lives Matter move-ment, outside the Richard\nRodgers, thousands were\nmarching in the streets of\nNew York in protest of the\nlack of judicial action against\nthe police officers who killed\nEric Garner whilst he was in\npolice custody. In Hamilton,\nMiranda ties the experience\nof the founding fathers with\nthe experience of America\u2019s\nminorities today.\nThroughout this\nelection cycle,\nthe far right in America have\nrailed against the \u2018browning\nof America\u2019, the process\nby which the demographic\nin America is changing\nto include more Hispanic\npeople, more African Americans, more Asian Americans.\nThis small but very vocal\nsubset have bemoaned the\nloss of an imagined past, in\nwhich America was \u201cgreat\u201d,\nHamilton seeks to highlight\nthat America is what always\nhas been; a land of immi-grants, \u201cyoung, scrappy, and\nhungry\u201d to leave their mark.\nThis is a subject that Miranda,\nhimself a second generation immigrant, clearly feels\nstrongly about. The musical\nrecasts the white American\nrevolutionaries with minority\nactors; George Washington\nis played by a black man,\nChris Jackson, Daveed Diggs\nis Thomas Jefferson (and\nMarquis de Lafayette), Phillipa Soo, an Asian American,\nplays Eliza Hamilton; the\nonly white actor is Jonathan\nGroff, playing George III, the\noppressor. The subtext could\nhardly be more unsubtle,\nor more revolutionary. In\ncasting minority actors in\nthe roles of the founding\nfathers, Miranda has opened\nup history to young minority\nchildren in America who\nhave never seen themselves\nreflected in the history books,\nor have felt any claim to the\nfounding of their nation.\nHamilton is an ode to America, to its revolutionary spirit,\nand its changing face. In one\nof the most moving verses in\nthe musical, Hamilton sings\n\u201cAmerica, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for\nme/You let me make a dif-ference/A place where even\norphan immigrants/Can leave\ntheir fingerprints and rise\nup.\u201d In Hamilton, America\u2019s\nheritage is celebrated, but the\nfounding fathers are not dei-fied; when Jefferson attacks\nHamilton on creating wealth\nsimply by \u201cmoving money\naround\u201d, and claims \u201cIn Virginia/we plant seeds in\nthe ground/We\ncreate,\u201d\nHamilton, an abolitionist hits\nback;\u201cYeah, keep ranting/We\nknow who\u2019s really doing the\nplanting.\u201d It is one of the few\nreferences to the founding\nfathers\u2019 support of slavery\nthat survives in the finished\nmusical, but the fact that is\naddressed at all is powerful.\nAmerica is a country built by\nimmigrants, by slaves, and\nby people of all races and\ncolours whose stories have\nbeen swept under the rug. It\nis also a country days from\npotentially voting in a xenophobic demagogue into the\nPresidency.\nHamilton the musical, its\nwriter, and its cast represents the best of America, its\ningenuity, inclusivity, ambition\nand creativity. One of the\ncandidates in this presidential\nelection represents the worst.\nWe, as the rest of the world,\ncan do nothing but look and\nhope that the electorate in\nAmerica take one of Hamilton\u2019s last words in the musical\nto heart; \u201cwise up.\u201d\nHamilton : An American\nMusical Original Cast Album\nis available on Spotify and\niTunes.\nDaveed Diggs stands beneath the portrait of President Thomas Jefferson, portrays in \u2018Hamilton\u2019 (left).

I, a\nLabour voter, am heartbroken, and have just spent\nfour hours on a coach to visit my tory-voting then-boy-friend. I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the lack of\ngloating and the sex has temporarily taken my mind\noff of my woes \u2013 that is until he, mid-thrust, looks\nme straight in the eye, says \u201cYou are Ed Miliband\u201d,\ndemands that I call him David Cameron, and continues with gusto. I\u2019m so taken off guard that I oblige,\nbut am now plagued by the harrowing mental image\nof poor Ed\u2019s resignation speech. Never trust a tory.\nI once slept with an artist, who lived in the attic of a\nhouse by the sea in Wales. After we\u2019d finished having\nsex (which was no mean feat, considering the paints,\ncanvasses, and easels I\u2019d had to climb over to get to\nthe futon in the corner), he took off the condom, tied\nthe end in a knot, and carried it over the the skylight.\nHe opened the window, and tossed the condom out\non the the roof, but before it landed, it was caught\nin mid-flight by a seagull, who promptly carried it\naway. I still don\u2019t know if he and the seagull had it\nprearranged.\nI was seeing this guy from America. He was only\nhere for one semester and he was staying in these\nAmerican Halls near Portland Street. After a few\ndates we wanted to go back to his, but there were\nno guests allowed, so I was snuck in with a crowd of\npeople. We got into his bedroom and he said that\nwe had to be really quiet because of the no guests\nrule. He then proceeded to get undressed and said\nthat there was something he liked to do that helped\nhim keep it quiet. I said that sounded like fun. He then\nreached behind his pillow and picked up a Batman\nmask. He put it on and said in the typical Batman\nvoice \u201cI\u2019m Batman\u201d. I was freaked out, but was also a\nbit drunk, so I dealt with it and we continued. About\n30 seconds later he asks, \u201ccan you tell me a riddle?\u201d\nand then shouts \u201cYOU\u2019RE THE JOKER! THE JOKER,\nTHE JOKER I SAY!\u201d. I freak out, (a) because wtf, and\n(b) because he shouted it. I quickly left the room and\nlooked the exit to leave. On my way out, the receptionist simply says, \u201cBatman guy?\u201d\nSo I\u2019d just got off work, at around ten, and I was\nmeeting this guy, a doctor who was also finishing\nwork. We met outside Charing Cross Hospital, and\nwent to the Southern Belle for a drink. We had our\ndrink, and as I was walking him back home, we\nclearly couldn\u2019t wait any longer, and started to make\nout on Margravine Road. At this point he just kneels\ndown, lowers my trousers, and proceeds to suck me\noff, right there on the street. I came on his face, he\nlaughed, I laughed, and we awkwardly bid our fare-wells. He messaged me the following week. I never\nreplied.\nThis one time there were five of us at a \u2018hang-out\u2019.\nEveryone was really chill and sensual, the vibes were\ngreat and we were all generally really enjoying each\nother\u2019s company. At some point I noticed that one of\nthe guys was missing, but I didn\u2019t really care at the\ntime considering there were another three people\nto keep my hands occupied. Until he reappeared.\nHe ran into our entangled bodies without warning,\nand slipped between us like an eel. He had covered\nhimself in oil. I thought it was massage oil until I got\na mouthful and realised it was actually olive oil. He\nmessaged me once afterwards. He said I probably\ndidn\u2019t remember him. I answered I couldn\u2019t possibly\nforget olive oil guy. He never messaged me again.\nI met a guy in Tiger Tiger and went back to his, he\nhad a nice flat, I go into the bedroom to see a HUGE\nGreat Dane on his bed. I like dogs, but this dog was\ntaking up the entire bed. The guy comes into the\nbedroom. Not thinking the dog was an issue and\ncontinues on as though the dog wasn\u2019t there. I stop\nhim, and ask about the dog. The guy says \u201cOh don\u2019t\nworry, he will move, he knows when\u201d, and so we go\non. Then the guy attempts to throw me onto the bed, I\nland on top of the dog, and the man climbs on. Now\nI\u2019m effectively in a sandwich between a half naked\nman and his giant dog. I stop the man like, \u201cthe dog\ngotta move\u201d, and the man reluctantly gets up and\nshooshes the dog out of the room. To this day I still\ndon\u2019t know why he felt the need to throw me on top\nof his dog.\nI was talking to a casual lover who happened to\nlive on my street. The conversation was getting quite\nheated and I was thinking of inviting him over when\nhe said he had a weird favour to ask me. I tell him\nto go ahead and he proceeds to ask me whether he\ncould borrow some lube. Surprised and rather disappointed I say sure, but warn him that I have one big\nbottle rather than individual single serving packets.\nUnfazed he reassures me it\u2019ll be fine. Ten minutes\nlater, he\u2019s knocking on my door. I let him in and take\nhim up to my room at where he whips a glass out of\nhis coat pocket. I squirt some lube in the glass, he\nthanks me and heads off. Ten minutes later I get a\nmessage from him saying I\u2019m welcome to join. Nope.\nCall me James Virgin organic\nI\u2019m Batman\nLube is the new sugar The great dane\nBirdfood\nMargavine Road\nIn the final leg of the\npresidential debate a few\ndays ago, supporters of\nRepublican nominee Donald\nTrump started spreading fake\nmemes under the hashtag\n#StopThePot in an attempt to\nmislead voters about Democratic presidential nominee\nHillary Clinton's marijuana\npolicy. Marijuana legalisa-tion is a hot topic in the USA\nright now, especially amongst\nyoung people. If young,\nnaive voters who haven't\nfollowed the election believed\nthe memes, they might have\nbecome less likely to vote for\nClinton at the ballot. Hillary\nClinton and Donald Trump\nhave shifted opinions on\nmarijuana in recent years\nand although both of them\nseem quite cautious around\nthe topic of recreational\nmarijuana use, Clinton\nappears to have a more spe-cific, less stigmatising stance\non it than Trump.\nClinton has repeatedly\nstated that she wants to move\nmarijuana from a Schedule I\ndrug to a Schedule II drug, as\nwell as to end incarceration\nof marijuana users. Trump\nstated that medical marijuana\nis something that should be\nconsidered, but legalisa-tion should be left up to the\nindividual states. When questioned on the effectiveness of\nmarijuana legalisation in the\nstate of Colorado, Trump said\nthat it was not exactly going\ntrouble-free and that weed\ncould have a negative impact\non people\u2019s health and cognitive abilities.\nBesides the subjective views\nof the presidential candidates,\ntheir campaign promises,\nand whether their mild\npro-mj support will translate\ninto real policies and laws,\nit is also worth noting that\nthere are several important\ngroups opposed to the legal-isation of marijuana. Police\ndepartments have become\ndependent on federal drug\nwar grants to finance their\nbudget. Private prison corporations make millions by\nincarcerating people who\nhave been imprisoned for\ndrug crimes. Alcohol and\ntobacco companies have\nlobbied to keep marijuana\nout of reach and of course\nbig pharma would like to\nkeep marijuana illegal so\nAmericans don\u2019t have access\nto cheap medical alternatives\nto their products.\nPurdue Pharma and Abbott\nLaboratories, makers of\nthe painkillers OxyContin\nand Vicodin are among the\nbiggest contributors to the\nAnti-Drug Coalition of America, and the Pharmaceutical\nResearch and Manufacturers\nof America, considered one\nof the legalisation movement\u2019s\nbiggest opponents, spent\nnearly $19m lobbying last\nyear.\nIn the end, based on what\nboth candidates have or\nhaven\u2019t said during the\npresidential race, the national\noutlook for weed might not\nlook all too different in a\nClinton presidency than it\nwould under Trump. Then\nagain, maybe their corporate\nliaisons will make all the difference in the world.\nWhilst the argument rages\naround recreational marijuana use in the US, here in\nthe UK we are having our\nown discussion, albeit slightly\nmore refined and subtle than\nour American cousins.\nLegal or decriminalised\nfor medical usage in 25 US\nstates, I hear many people\nasking, \u201cWhy is the marijuana\ndebate so lethargic here in\nthe UK?\u201d Whilst there are\nmany potential explanations,\none of the most striking is the\nwill of our political parties.\nAt the last general election,\nboth Labour and the Conservatives campaigned under\nthe banner of abstinence.\nWith Labour opting for a\ncatchy tagline of \u201cWe will\nban the sale and distribution\nof dangerous psychoactive\nsubstances\u201d. Whilst the\nConservatives opted for an\nequally fetching \u201cAbstinence\nand full recovery is the goal\u201d.\nWhen policies such as these\nare quoted from the UK\u2019s two\nlargest political parties we\ncan hardly expect any form\nof large scale drug reform.\nMeanwhile, the Liberal\nDemocrats opted for a more\n(perhaps unsurprisingly)\nliberal approach. In 2015\nthey campaigned under the\nproviso \u201cEstablish a review to\nassess the effectiveness of the\ncannabis legalisation experiments in the United States\nand Uruguay in relation to\npublic health and criminal\nactivity\u201d, which seems to take\nsome form of inspiration from\nthe successes of the American model. Furthermore,\nthe Green Party adopted\na similar proposal with the\nmanifesto quote \u201cAdopt an\nevidence-based approach to\nstep-by-step regulation, starting with cannabis\u201d. However,\nit is more likely that we will\nhear Hillary Clinton say the\nwords \u2018Make America great\nagain\u2019 than we are to see a\nLiberal Democrat and Green\nParty coalition.\nWith the Conservative party\nin a shambles over Brexit and\nJeremy Corbyn looking as\nincompetent as Ed Miliband, it likely there will be no\ndomestic reform regarding\nmarijuana use. With the two\nmajor political parties of the\nUK distracted by issues such\nas these, don\u2019t expect any far\nreaching drug reform policy\nin the foreseeable future. Currently, the marijuana debate\nappears to have been put\nin the corner like a naughty\nchild.\nAlthough here in the UK we\noften view ourselves as more\nliberally progressive than\nour counterparts in the US, it\nappears that this time, due to\nthe insufficient will of our poli-ticians, those across the pond\nmay actually beat us to it.\nUSA | Hilary vs.\nTrump, but does\nit really make a\ndifference?\nAgnese Abrusci\nUK | Tories,\nLabour, Lib\nDems, and\nGreeeeeeeeens\nChristopher Haigh\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n5\n\n"

This\nSouth African born engineer,\ninventor and progressive\nthinker is on a quest to save\nmankind from itself through\nrenewable energy, space\nexploration and by tackling\nwhatever global issue he sets\nhis mind on. Musk has often\nbeen compared to a real life\nTony Stark.\nOnly days ago, he unveiled\nyet another revolutionary\nidea: a roof made entirely\nof solar panels, which would\nprovide electricity to an entire\nhome. The launch was held on\nthe set for Desperate Housewives, at Universal Studios\nin Los Angeles, where one\nhouse was chosen as a prototype to demonstrate how\nthe roof would appear. You\nmay be wondering what these\nhigh-tech roofs look like. Well,\neach solar panel has been\ndesigned to appear indistinguishable from conventional\nroof shingles. Even more, the\nfa\u00e7ade was created through\nan optical illusion, where the\ntiles appear opaque when\nseen from the ground, but\ntransparent when facing the\nsun to allow energy to pass\nthrough. One small drawback\nto this effect is a 2% loss\nin efficiency compared to\nstandard solar panels. Nonetheless, Mr. Musk stated that\nhe will be investing over $3\nmillion to maximize energy\nabsorption.\nDuring the launch, it was\nannounced that the tiles will\nbe released in four distinct\nstyles \u2013 Tuscan, Slate, Textured and Smooth \u2013 a brilliant\ndecision that will appeal to\na wide range of consumers.\nThese slick slates are made\nfrom tempered quartz glass,\nproviding them with higher\ndurability than standard\nasphalt and giving them a\nlifespan of at least 50 years,\ncompared to 20. Musk also\nclaims they will have the\ncapacity to defrost themselves\nwith specialized heating ele-ments, similar to those in cars.\nDespite how exciting this\nannouncement has been\nfor most of the world, some\nremain skeptical of their\naccessibility to middle class\nhomes because, oddly\nenough, actual prices of\nproducing and installing the\ntiles remains a mystery. Nonetheless, Musk stated that the\ncost will be lower than current\nroof and electricity expenses.\nInstallments are scheduled\nto begin next summer in\nCalifornia, with two versions\navailable. Purchasing this\nsystem will include a newly\ndeveloped integrated home\nbattery to serve as a back\nup, storing enough energy to\npower a four-bedroom house\nfor a day.\nThere is no doubt that\nthe potential low cost and\npracticality of these new solar\npanels are two of the main\naspects making it attractive\nto homeowners. But, the most\nimportant and obvious reason\nto purchase them is that they\nuse clean, sustainable energy.\nThe use of fossil fuels is still a\nsevere problem globally, and\nit is worth stressing we are all\nboth the creators and victims\nof the repercussions they are\nhaving on the environment.\nThereareholesinSpace!\nI\nn spite of the seemingly\neverlasting state of\nconflict in the international\ncommunity, all countries\nhave pretty much agreed\nto pretend to be friends in\nouter space.\nThe UN Outer Space Treaty,\nadopted unanimously in\n1963, outlined the ground\nrules for outer space use\nand exploration, including\nfluffy clauses on helping\nany astronauts in trouble,\nirrespective of their country\nof origin, and keeping all\nparts of outer space freely\naccessible to all states (i.e.\nnot invading space to become\nthe Emperor of the Universe).\nThe treaty also prohibited\nplacing nuclear weapons or\nweapons of mass destruction on celestial bodies, in\nEarth\u2019s orbit or anywhere\nelse in outer space, which\nis why we can be relatively\ncertain that the moon will\nstill be there when we wake\nup tomorrow. Other types of\nweapons, however, did not\nget a mention in that treaty\nor in any of the following UN\nspace law agreements, so if\nsomebody attempted a kinetic\norbital strike from the Earth\u2019s\norbit and flung a projectile\nat whatever country they\u2019re\nhaving relationship issues\nwith at the moment, the act\nwould technically be legal\nas far as space law is con-cerned. While this may seem\nalarming, us humans already\nhave so many other of ways\nwe could perish as a species\nthat this little issue is but a\nsingle star in our increasingly\nperilous universe.\nF\nact: blind people\ndon\u2019t see darkness.\nThey see nothing.\nI\u2019ll admit this seems\ncounter-intuitive;\nmost of us would\nshout \u201cI can\u2019t see anything\u201d\nwhen stumbling around in the\npitch-dark. But understanding\nblindness requires a bit more\nthought.\nIt does depend on the\ntype of blindness. Acquired\nblindness seems to leave\npatients with light rather than\ndarkness: imagine a speaker\nwith an unplugged Aux cable\n\u2013 you\u2019ve heard that buzzing\nnoise? If your optic nerve is\nsevered, random signals are\ngenerated in much the same\nway, resulting in constant\nrandom dancing patterns of\nlight. And of course, closing\nyour eyes won\u2019t make them\ngo away, so darkness is in\nfact the one thing you never\nsee.\nIf you are born blind\nthough, the issue is a little\ndifferent. With no concept of\nsight, individuals born blind\nlack a perception of light and\ndarkness in the same way\nas humans lack a perception\nof magnetic fields, or the 5th\ndimension. It\u2019s not \u2018darkness\u2019\nin the way we might imagine;\nthe best way to understand\nit is to ask yourself what you\ncan \u2018see\u2019 behind you right\nnow. We don\u2019t see a large\nblack blob everywhere outside our field of vision \u2013 we\nsee nothing, and that\u2019s just\nnormal.\nIt\u2019s probably different for\neach person who experiences\nblindness, but safe to say its a\nlittle different to putting on a\nblindfold.\nBlind\nBut Now I See\nI Once Was\nWhy Elon Musk\u2019s newest invention is smart, sexy and sustainable\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nDanel Medelbekova\nEva Coles\n//Tesla Motors\nAnother setback for the quest of finding a reliable male contraceptive, with reports of side\neffects in clinical trials causing concern\nT\nalking about\nImperial Girl\u2019s\nCan, isn\u2019t it about\ntime for a bit of\nequality when\nit comes to birth\ncontrol? Men currently only\nhave 3 options: condoms,\nvasectomies and withdrawal\n(not recommended),\ncompared to the multiple\nwomen can choose from.\nUnfortunately, side effects\nare common alongside\nhormonal contraception\nmethods resulting in mood\nswings, depression, weight\ngain, acne, or heavy periods.\nHaving a male equivalent is a\nmore balanced compromise,\nbut would also allow men to\ntake control of their fertility,\nmaking it more of a two-way\nstreet. A report showed that\nover half of women forgot to\ntake at least one Pill during\ntheir last cycle. Yikes.\nA recent study has been\npublished that has found\nhormone injections in males to\nbe 96% efficient in stopping\neffects and increase efficiency\nfrom 96% up to the female\nequivalent of 99.9%. It\u2019s\nalso quite annoying, with the\nmen having to return to the\nclinic for injections every few\nweeks.\nBut good news! There\u2019s\nanother male nonw-hormo-nal contraceptive to watch\nout for which may be even\nmore exciting. \u2018Vasalgel\u2019 is\nestimated to hit the US drug\nmarket by 2020. Just like\nthe implant for girls, it only\ninvolves one injection and\ncould last for years. It works\nas a temporary vasectomy,\nwith a polymer that blocks\nsperm from getting through\nthe sperm tubes. It can then\nbe reversed by a second\ninjection that dissolves the\npolymer, letting the sperm\nswim free. So fear not! It\nmay not immediate, but male\ncontraception is coming soon.\nPun intended.\nLizzie Riach\n// 20 out of the 320\nparticipants had to\ndrop out due to adverse side effects //\nunwanted pregnancies\nHowever, 20 out of the 320\nparticipants had to drop out\ndue to \u201cadverse side effects\u201d.\nThese included depression,\npain at the injection site,\nincreased libido and acne.\nDespite these few, the majority of other participants only\nsuffered mild effects, and\n75% said that they wouldn\u2019t\nmind continuing this method\nof contraception at the end of\nthe trial.\nYou may have seen reports\nthat this avenue of contraception has been dismissed\ndue to side effects that sound\npretty similar to those already\nexperienced by women on\nhormonal contraception.\nQuite rightly, this annoyed\na lot of people who claimed\nthat this is a bit unfair, but\nit seems this isn\u2019t the only\nreason. The method itself\nneeds time to reduce side\nWill sperm ever be stopped?\nL\net the flags fly\nand wars rage.\nVeganism is probably\none of the most\ncontentious topics\nof our time. Though\nI am not fully vegan due to\npersonal reasons, I joined\nVegSoc because, after\nwatching documentaries\nlike Cowspiracy and Food\nMatters, anyone would be\nhard-pressed to lay off meat\nslightly. I think it\u2019s time we\nappreciate the ups and downs\nof veganism, as contrary to\npopular belief, vegans aren\u2019t\nthe angry meat prosecutors\nmost people think they are.\nThe argument is two-sided: some claim veganism\nprolongs health, others\nexperience a physical decline\nafter the switch. Of course,\nscience can help to explain\nwhy some people fare worse\nmost think, Vitamin A, which\npromotes good vision and\nimmune response, is not\npresent in its active form in\nplants (whereas it is in animal\nproducts). The veggie form\nmust then be converted by a\nspecial enzyme in order to be\nused by the body. Those with\nlower levels of this enzyme\n(around 45% of us), have\ndifficulty getting enough Vitamin A from plants alone. Low\nthyroid function and poor gut\nhealth only exacerbate this\ncondition.\n3. Starch tolerance. Most\nvegans will have to compensate for lower meat levels\nwith more carbohydrates,\nbut again, this depends on\none\u2019s ability to process all\nthat starch. We all need an\nenzyme called alpha-amylase\nto break down starch, however those historically more\ninclined to eating starch, such\nas Japanese or Southeast\nAsians, have more copies of\nthe alpha-amylase gene. For\nthose with low starch toler-ance, sudden carb influx will\nlead to shaky blood sugar\nlevels and possibly weight\ngain.\nSo what are we supposed to\ndo with all this information?\nTrial and error is probably\nour best bet. With the right\nmicrobes and genes, a vegan\ndiet supplemented with Vitamin B12 can do wonders, but\nit\u2019s up to you to listen to your\nbody.\nAlexandra Lim\nthan others. Here are a few\nkey reasons for differing\nresponses:\n1. It\u2019s your gut\u2019s fault.\nTo sum it up, some gut\nmicrobiomes are more\nveggie-friendly than others.\nImportant bacterial communities synthesise Vitamin K2,\nwhich is needed for skeletal\nhealth and to maintain insulin\nlevels. Alongside this, K2 is\nfound almost exclusively in\nanimal products. So, if someone\u2019s microbiome is lacking\nthese bacteria, without animal\nproducts K2 levels will drop,\nleading to increased risk of\nfractures and other horrid\nstuff like cardiovascular\ndisease.\n2. Vitamin A. Unlike what\nTo be or not to be vegan?\nWhy veganism isn\u2019t for everyone\n\n"

Consent\nMatters is a 2 hour course\nthat, from the preview on\ntheir website, appears to be\ncomposed entirely of stick-figure animations with a\nnarration so mind-numbingly\npatronising that the viewer\nregresses into a child-like\nstate as they\u2019re taught the\nthoroughly novel lesson that\n\u2018sometimes touching people\u2019s\nno-no parts is bad\u2019.\nwere never presented with\na cartoon telling them that\nyou shouldn\u2019t have sex with\nunconscious people is utterly\ndelusional. The only people\nwho will go to the trouble of\ntaking this course are those\nwho already value learning\nabout consent. Anyone who\nis forced to take the course\nfor disciplinary reasons (as\nsuggested by the DPW at\nCouncil) will also extract zero\nbenefit as they have already\nshown a wilful disregard for\nothers\u2019 ownership of their own\nbodies that an hour of cheery\nnarration cannot fix (although\nperhaps the soul-destroying\nboredom of the experience\nwill be a well-deserved\npunishment). In short, this\npurchase will contribute\nnothing to the student\nexperience on campus.\nDespite this, our elected\nrepresentatives saw fit to have\n\u00a35,000 of College money put\ntowards this purchase. That\u2019s\n5/9 of annual tuition for most\nof you, or just enough for a\nbrand new reception desk in\nthe Union. That\u2019s many times\nlarger than the RCSU\u2019s entire\nWelfare budget. Imagine\nwhat could have been done\nwith it had it been secured for\nfunding clubs and societies,\nor for Constituent Unions to\nspend on real, meaningful\ncontributions to student\nwelfare. This is \u00a35,000\ncompletely and utterly wasted.\nIt is true that the engagement\nof the student body with Union\nCouncil is essentially nil (heck,\nmost of those with a seat on\nCouncil don\u2019t show up most\nof the time). Because of this,\nUnion staff and sabbatical\nofficers (who, as this incident\nshows, can be just as out-of-publication embarrassing to\na Union Officer, the highest\npurpose of a Student Union\n\u2013 to stand up for its members\nagainst the University \u2013 was\ncompletely perverted. These\nthings can happen because\nstaff are only accountable\nto us through the sabbatical\nofficers, who themselves are\nonly accountable through\nCouncil, in which the majority\nof us do not engage.\nIf we, as students and\nmembers of Imperial College\nUnion, do not make our voices\nheard, this will only continue.\nAs the accountability of\nthe Union to its members\nevaporates, it can only\nbecome less and less student-focused and more and more\nof a \u2018Student Appeasement\nDivision\u2019 of Imperial College\nLondon.

Basically, \u201cA\nvote for anyone but Hillary\nClinton is a vote for Donald\nTrump\u201d, and at least from a\nmathematical standpoint, it\u2019s a\ndifficult point to argue against.\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to like\neither any of the mainstream\ncandidates, the most damning\nobservation I\u2019ve made while\nwitnessing this election is the\namount of people on both\nsides who have disregarded\nlogical arguments for the sake\nfor supporting their preferred\ncandidate.\nIt\u2019s the type of loyalty you\nsee in sports fans supporting\ntheir teams on and off the\nfield. The problem is we\u2019re\nnot talking about games here.\nWe\u2019re talking about real issues\nin one of the most powerful\ncountries in the world, and\nhow we should try and solve\nthem.\nLet\u2019s rewind to the candidate\nI chose: Jill Stein. I actually\nwitnessed Stein at the DNC\nwhen I covered it for the\nPhiladelphia Inquirer and\nDaily News back in June.\nFirst, I\u2019ll establish the fact that\nby ruling out the Donald and\nthe Hilldog, that leaves Stein,\nthe Green Party candidate,\nand Libertarian Party\ncandidate Gary Johnson. Both\nhave a lot of strengths, but I\nlean towards Stein because of\nsome radical changes Johnson\nproposes, including abolishing\nthe Internal Revenue Service,\neliminating corporation taxes\nand ending the Department of\nEducation.\nThe problem with voting for\none of these candidates is that\nthere are considerable flaws\nin both, which was nicely\nhighlighted in John Oliver\u2019s\nLast Week Tonight in October.\nJohnson, when asked by a\nreporter, couldn\u2019t name a\nforeign world leader off the\ntop of his head. Stein thinks\nthat when the government\nbailed out Wall Street, that it\nwas done through a \u201cmagic\ntrick\u201d known as quantitative\neasing. News flash: that easing\nisn\u2019t a trick, it\u2019s actually an\nadvanced monetary tool that\nhas been extensively studied\nin the world of academia.\nAnd yet, they both seem\nlike much better options than\nwhat the Democratic and\nRepublican parties have\nproduced. Both Johnson and\nStein agree that marijuana\nshould be legalised. In\nAmerica, that drug is currently\nclassified as Schedule I. In\nother words, it\u2019s somehow as\ndangerous as heroin.\nThey also believe in prison\nreform and police brutality as\nsevere issues, at a time where\nthose topics have generated a\nlot of news and debate in the\nstates.\nIt\u2019s been very interesting to\nwitness this election season\nfrom over 3000 miles away,\nand I\u2019ve been pleasantly\nsurprised at how informed\nBritish people are about it. But\nas my professor here has told\nus, the United States impacts\nEurope severely, especially\neconomically.\nI\u2019ve tried to make sense of\nhow so many of my people\nin my country could gravitate\ntowardstwoofthemostdisliked\npresidential candidates in\nthe United States\u2019 history.\nOn the one hand, Trump is\ncertainly not a politician,\nand he definitely fits the anti-establishment bill well. Clinton\nhas more than three decades\nof experience in the political\nfield, and has accomplished\nseveral objectives while in her\nnumerous positions.\nBut here\u2019s the issue: Trump\nhas committed a laundry list of\nactions during his campaign\nthat make him look like not\nonly an idiot, but also a man\nwho should not have the\nresponsibility of being one of\nthe most powerful politicians\nin the world. With Clinton,\nthere\u2019s so much secrecy and\nsuspicious activity during her\ntime as a politician \u2013 most\nrecently in this email scandal\nthat has just reappeared in the\nnews \u2013 that electing her would\nessentially just be a vote for a\n\u2018big political machine\u2019, for lack\nof a better term.\nBut here are my two options:\na candidate who certainly\nhas the experience, but has\nalso partaken in a lot of\nsuspicious activity throughout\nher political career. The\nother option is a man who\napparently thinks talking\nabout sexually assaulting\nwomen is just \u201clocker room\ntalk\u201d and then claims that\n\u201cno one has more respect for\nwomen\u201d than him.\nI\u2019m not a smart guy. We\nestablished that in the first\nthree words of this piece. But\nI am smart enough to think\nfor myself. Perhaps more\nimportantly, I am willing to\ndebate my opinions with other\npeople who disagree, without\ntaking the attacks against my\nideas so personally.\nBut to hundreds of thousands\nof people in my country voting\nfor Clinton or Trump, I see this\npolitical season developing\nlike a heated sports rivalry.\nThe problem is this is politics,\nnot sports. And politics is too\nimportant to be like sports.\n\n"

The\nwomen\u2019s 2nd\ns started their\nleague off against Royal\nHolloway, kicking off with\n\u00e9p\u00e9e. The team was off to\na flying start with the final\nscore 45-42 to Imperial.\nNext up was sabre. Despite\na severe lack of experience\nand by a stroke of brilliance\nthe team did markedly better\nin sabre than they had in\n\u00e9p\u00e9e, finishing 45-39. Royal\nHolloway learnt the hard way\nthat the best way to trigger\naggression in a sabreur is\nto make then believe their\nopponent has stolen all their\nfood. Foil was a little shakier,\ngoing into the final bout\n19-40. The final fencer was\nGinevra; an \u00e9p\u00e9eist at heart\nbut after this performance she\nmay want to reconsider! Point\nafter point, parry after parry\nGinevra scored, clawing\nImperial\u2019s score up to 38 and\ndoubling the team\u2019s effort\nup to that stage. Imperial\nsupporters cheered on\nGinevra as she exceeded all\nexpectations and delivered\nthe most spectacular\ncomeback seen by the team\nin living memory. Despite\nlosing foil, the women\u2019s 2nd\ns\nwon the match overall, with\nan accumulative score of 128-126, starting off the year with\na win.\nThe men\u2019s 2nd\ns, already\nriding high off their first win\nof the year (also against\nRoyal Holloway), were\nfencing Portsmouth. The men\nwasted no time in the first\nweapon, foil, where they\nwon comfortably with a\nscore of 45-26. Next up was\nsabre where the score ended\n45-17 to Imperial, meaning\nwe could have scored no\npoints in epee and still won\nthe match. Luckily epee kept\nup this streak winning 45-29, giving an overall score\nof 135-73, meaning the\nmen\u2019s 2nd\ns matches have all\nbeen won on average by an\nimpressive margin of over\n50! Finally, over the weekend\nthree Imperial fencers\ncompeted in the prestigious\nElite \u00c9p\u00e9e.

With their\nshiny new red & blue vests,\nthe newest members of the\nclub were ready to represent\nagainst the masses of UCL,\nKings, Brunel and St. Mary\u2019s,\nto name but a few.\nAn impressive turnout made\nthis an atmospheric race with\n150 in the men\u2019s race and\n103 in the women\u2019s. Imperial\nalso had a record number of\nparticipants with 48 lining up.\nThe start was slightly manic as\nusual, with spectators wondering whether Club Captain\nJones had got a head start as\nhe sped up the looming hill to\ntake some photos.\nJohnson led the women\ncoming in an excellent\n9th\nafter a gruelling half\nmarathon the weekend\nbefore. New recruits Van\nZelst and Olding both had\nexcellent debut races, coming\n13th\nand 16th\nrespectively.\nDespite complaining about\nnot racing until halfway\nround, Women\u2019s Captain\nMundell came in 23rd\n, placing\nImperial 3rd\noverall out of 22\nparticipating teams. Strong\nfinishes from Imperial 2s\nplaced them in 10th, with a\nspecial mention for debutant\nSofia Bettanin who finished\n51st.\nIn the men\u2019s race Selley led\nout a solid first lap to gain 5th\nfor his first race in an Imperial\nvest, followed by Allison\nin 7th. Scriven, Johnson,\nJones and Garcia all worked\nimpeccably to finish 25th\n, 41st\n,\n44th\nand 45th\nrespectively. This\nplaces the Imperial Men\u2019s 1st\nteam in a strong 4th\nout of 29.\nCircuits specialist Jackson\npowered through to 49th\nfor the men\u2019s 2nd\ns, followed\nby Knight coming in 60th\n(who had already cycled to\nthe race beforehand). Core\ncoach Jones crunched his\nway to an excellent 68th,\nwith fresher Collyer putting\nin an excellent first display\nto finish 72nd\n.

The men\u2019s 3rd\nand\n4th\nteams finished 15th\nand 19th\noverall.\nThe club was impressed\nwith all new-comers, from veterans of the mud and cold to\nthose who have never taken\npart in a race before. Committee members commented that\nthis was the strongest Imperial\nteam they had seen in years.\nOnce again ICXCAC would\nlike to congratulate all those\nwho raced and look forward\nto seeing more new faces at\nthe next LCL on Wednesday\nthe 2nd\nof November at Mitcham Common.\nHarry Allingham\nICWomen\u2019sRugby:Brunelconverttovictory\nBecks Simpson\nA\nfter last\nSaturday\u2019s\ndevastatingly\nclose defeat\nto Brunel in\na friendly,\nImperial was on a mission\nto right this wrong and be\ndeemed victorious on the\npitch. They marched out with\ndetermination \u2013 the likes of\nwhich has not been seen since\nwe put a man on the moon \u2013\nwith two subs to cheer them\non. Alas, this would prove\ninsufficient.\nImperial battled valiantly,\nwith back Anna claiming a\ntry, but there was no stopping\nBrunel\u2019s onslaught. As the\ngame wore on the ball went\nback and forth so much you\nwould\u2019ve thought it was a\nBrexit campaigner. Imperial\ngave way to three tries from\nthe Brunel side, but scored\nanother two itself. Football\nexperienced Anna would go\non to be awarded \u2018back of\nthe match\u2019 for converting two\nof Imperials three tries, one\nfrom a near impossible angle.\nNow 2/3 is a respectable conversion rate, but if\nImperial can do one thing, it\u2019s\nbasic mathematics, and tragically 3/3 is greater than 2/3.\nBrunel converted all three of\nits opportunities and went on\nto win 21-19.\nWhile an upsetting result,\nthis game was not without\nits merits. The Imperial team\nhave already showed a\ngreat improvement since the\nbeginning of the season,\nthere was quick and effective\nrucking with strong footholds\nand powerful drivings of the\nball up the pitch. Shout-out to\nforward of the match Laura.\nAll in all, it has been a\ngreat start to the season for\nImperial Women\u2019s Rugby, it is\nonly unfortunate that this loss\nby the slimmest of margins\nwill constitute the same points\nas one lost by hundreds.\nIf this article has piqued\nyour interest, Imperial Women\u2019s Rugby is hosting a taster\nfrom 2 till 4 in Lillie Park,\nHammersmith this Saturday\nthe 5th\nof November for all\nabilities.

The player\nof the match unsurprisingly\nwas the GK captain Kath,\nwho pushed for every\nturnover with an impressively\nhigh success rate, especially\nin the second half of the\nmatch. 43-36 final score.\nT\nhe first team had\nto wait 3 games to\ntaste victory, but it\nwas definitely worth\nit. Pre-ACC matches\nalways have an\nextra sense of excitement but\nthe home game at Heston\nagainst St Mary\u2019s was the\n1s first cup game and had a\ngreat atmosphere before the\nmatch even started. In the\nfirst quarter the game stayed\ntight at 11-6, with a relatively\nnew team not used to playing\ntogether. Impressive defensive\ndisplays from Kath, Filippa\nand Annie in the second\nquarter ensured St Mary\u2019s\nonly scored two goals in the\nsecond quarter.\nThe game got progressively\nlouder as the collective\nconfidence of the team grew.\nThe attacking side, bolstered\nby new members in both\nthe mid court and shooting\nsections, capitalised on this\nby gaining a substantial\nadvantage in goal difference\nthanks to some great\nshooting. The third quarter\ntightened the score slightly\nwith stamina always being\nan issue at the start of the\nseason. Luckily (or unluckily\ndepending on your outlook)\nthe clubs\u2019 new coaches\nhave increased the focus on\nfitness in training, with the\nteam recovering their form in\nthe final quarter, stretching\nout their lead and breaking\nthe 50-goal target set at\nhalf time. Everyone played\nwell but St Mary\u2019s selected\nGS/GA Maddie as player\nof the match. Overall, the\nperformance exhibits good\nteamwork within the 1s and\nbodes well for the future.\nFinal score 53-21.

In a rather unique set\ndesign, audience members\nface each other from benches\n(which are perhaps just a bit\ntoo cosy) on either side of the\nroom. The stage itself sits in\nthe middle; a medical-white\ncuboid running the length\nof the room, with its two\nbench-facing sides missing.\nIt\u2019s more reminiscent of a zoo\nexhibition than a theatre, and\nbeing able to see the faces\nof half your fellow attendees\ncan be rather off-putting,\nespecially when one of\nthem nods off during scene\ntwo. We\u2019ll put that down to\nthe humidity in the room,\nhowever, because the play\nand performances from Nigel\nLindsay (of Four Lions fame)\nand Sarah Ridgeway are\nbrilliant.\nAnyone Who Knows What\nLove Is (Will Understand) signals the start of the play. \u201cYou\ncan blame me, try to shame\nme, and still I\u2019ll care for you\u201d,\nsings Irma Thomas; I love it\nwhen a seemingly insignificant song encapsulates an\nentire piece perfectly. A\nfather is joined in the kitchen\nby his daughter, whereupon she shows off her new\nuniform, dodges questions\nabout what she\u2019s learnt in\nschool, and chats about her\nnew job at a carvery. Boring,\nright? But something is off.\nHer father happily pours\nher not one but two pretty\nhefty glasses of Baileys,\neven though she\u2019s only 15,\nand then proceeds to scold\nher for wearing mascara.\nDad knows all his daughter\u2019s\nfavourite GCSE subjects,\none of which is Biology. She,\nhowever, doesn\u2019t even know\nwhat osmosis is. Weirdest of\nall, their rapport is remark-able. Maybe you were less\nof an angst-ridden teenager\nthan I was, but the last thing\nin the world I wanted to do\nat 15 was relay every detail\nof my life to my parents. The\ndaughter, on the other hand,\nrevels in it. By mid-scene I\u2019ve\ndecided that Smith simply\ndoesn\u2019t know how to write\nyoung characters and I\u2019m\ndreading the remaining hour\nin the sweaty theatre. Then,\nin the last 20 seconds of the\nscene, it clicks. The whole\nscene comes together and it\u2019s\nliterally jaw dropping. It\u2019s not\nthemselves \u2013 it\u2019s impossible to\nwant anything other than the\ninevitable to occur. \u201cDo it\u201d\none audience member whispers behind me. It\u2019s edge of\nthe seat viewing. Again, quite\nliterally; I could see them\nperched across from me.\nIn scene two Harrogate\nlose its spark a little. It dithers\nfor just long enough that my\neyes wander to the sleeping\nattendee, and our actors go\nfrom dry-eyed to inconsolable crying in the blink of an\neye; it\u2019s less than convincing.\nSimilarly, the final moments of\nacting feel somewhat forced:\nAdam Gellatly\nHarrogate is touring the\ncountry until November 16,\npassing through Oxford,\nCantebury, Norwich, and\nCambridge, among others.\nTickets from \u00a310 \\\\ Concessions\navailable\nAn unnerving couple \\\\ Richard Lakos\nHarrogate\nbad playwriting, it\u2019s phenomenal playwriting.\nThe mastery of Harrogate\nis that it does this more than\nonce; just when I think I\u2019ve got\nthe play figured out it twists\nagain and I\u2019m at a loss, but\nstill desperate to know the\ntruth. To reveal any significant\ndetails of the play\u2019s plot\nwould ruin the viewing; suffice\nto say it\u2019s shocking, and sometimes horrific. Despite this,\nas the play approaches its\nfinale \u2013 and the true nature of\nevents have finally revealed\n\\\\ The mastery of\nHarrogate is that just\nwhen you think I\u2019ve\ngot play figured out\nit twists again \\\\\nI read the stage directions, it\ncould have been done better.\nSomeone across the way is\neven lightly chuckling to themselves at this point, by which\ntime I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t like\nthe set.\nIn the end, such minor blips\ndo little to damage what is\na brilliantly written play. It\ntackles a subject matter I have\nseen not seen addressed on\nthe stage with seriousness and\ngrace, while remembering\nthat to entertain its audience\nis the most important task.\nSadly, Harrogate\u2019s remaining\ndates at the Royal Court are\nsold out, but it will be touring\nthe UK throughout November.\nHaving been so well received\nnot once but twice now in\nthe last two years however, it\nwouldn\u2019t be at all surprising if\nwe see it reincarnated in the\ncapital again very soon.\n\\\\ The play\nmanages to tackle\na subject matter\nI have seen not\nseen addressed\non the stage with\nseriousness and\ngrace \\\\\nOneiric\nlandscapes\nof strange\nenchantment\nP\naul Nash was an\nartist best known\nfor two things: his\nportrayal of English\nlandscapes, and his\nwork as an official\nartist in both World Wars.\nNature and war - two seemingly irreconcilable themes,\nare portrayed by Nash in his\nown distinctive style. Born in\nKensington, he spent his early\nyears painting the scenery\nof his country home in Buckinghamshire. Even in these\nearliest works Nash imbues\nhis landscapes with character,\nsuch as in The Three, where a\ncluster of three elm trees form\na strange, vaguely menacing figure that towers over\nthe surrounding farmland.\nNash was also a poet and a\nwriter, and his early symbolic\nimages of the sea, the moon,\nand the night (themes that\nwould recur in his later works)\nwere accompanied by verses\npenned by his own hand.\nNash was enlisted as a\nprivate in 1914 as WWI\nwas breaking out. By 1917\nwhen he returned to the\nWestern Front as an official\nwar artist, his initial idealism had been completely\nshattered. In a letter to his\nwife, he wrote, \u201cSunset and\nsunrise are blasphemous\u2026\nIt is unspeakable, godless,\nhopeless.\u201d Nash no longer\nsaw himself as an artist, but\nas a messenger whose role\nwas to expose the horrors of\nwar. Being the great nature-lover that he was, Nash\nportrayed the brutality of\nwar not in bloody scenes of\ncarnage, but in landscapes\nviolated and destroyed. In\nhis cynically titled work We\nAre Making A New World,\nthe black and blasted stumps\nof trees point starkly from\nthe gouged earth towards\na blood-red sky; almost a\ndenunciation. Also on display\nis The Menin Road, a large oil\npainting showing two soldiers\nstruggling along a surreal\nlandscape pockmarked with\nshell-holes and detritus. The\nsoldiers are dwarfed in the\nhostile landscape, the path\nis barely visible, and once\nagain truncated tree-trunks\npoint impotently at the sky.\nSuffering from emotional\nshock, Nash moved to the\nseaside village of Dymchurch\nto recuperate after the\nwar. The sea, as well as the\nDymchurch seawall, were the\nsubject matter for a number\nof paintings he created. It\nwas also at this time when\nhe began to experiment\nmore with geometric and\nabstracted shapes. In the\nbleak and visually arresting\n\u201cWinter Sea\u201d, monochromatic\nwaves roll in towards the\nviewer, turning as they do so\ninto angular, unmoving frozen\nsheets.\nWith Nash, one gets the\nsense that objects are never\nClaire Chen\nPaul Nash is on at the Tate\nBritain until 5 March 2017\n26 Oct 2016 \u2013 5 Mar 2017\nTickets \u00a315 \\\\ Concessions \u00a313.10\nFree for members\nPaul Nash - Spring in the Trenches,\nRidge Wood (1917) \\\\ Tate\nthe Sunflower, a sunflower\nwithers and blooms with the\nsun; in Flight of the Magnolia,\nblossoms unfurl as clouds in\nthe sky.\nAnalogies aside, the isolated subjects of Nash\u2019s works\nhide an occult significance\nor symbolism. Set alone in a\ndesolate landscape, objects\nlike the metal scaffolding of\nPylons or the petrified piece\nof wood in Stone Tree seem\nto mean more than what\nthey are at face value. Nash\nalso placed large geometric\nobjects in the middle of his\nlandscapes, such as a cube\non the shore in Dymchurch\nSteps or large abstract\nfigures in Equivalents for\nthe Megaliths. Displacing\nsomething from its usual\ncontext was, for Nash, a way\nto provoke disquietude and\nlend everyday objects an air\nof surrealism. Juxtapositions\n\u2013 between the object and the\nlandscape, between sea and\nland, between the organic\nand the abstract \u2013 can be\nfound everywhere in Nash\u2019s\npaintings.\nHis landscapes, though vast\nand desolate, are charged\nwith a primal power and\nmysterious symbolism. Devoid\nof human figures, theirs is an\nunsettling and empty world.\nBut as Rilke says, \u201cbeauty is\nnothing but the beginning of\nterror\u201d. Their very strangeness makes them beautiful.\nEndlessly confronting the\nviewer, Nash\u2019s works seem to\npose questions to which no\nanswers exist.\nPaul Nash - Equivalents for the Megaliths (1935) \\\\\nTate\n\\\\ One gets the\nsense that objects\nare never quite what\nthey seem \\\\\nquite what they seem.\nIn Totes Meer, one of the\nmost famous images of WWII,\nthe jagged crests of a roiling\nsea threaten to crash onto an\nadjacent plain.

Although it\nwas challenging, I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019ve\nhad a smooth transition, primarily due to\nthe UK\u2019s hospitable nature. Having made\nthe decision to come to the UK out of one\u2019s\nown volition, it is unfair to state that one\nhas had to make the UK their home as if\none has been forced into the decision.\nIn reality, the author chose to study in a\ncountry that he claims to dislike so much.\nAlthough the article talks about the\nchauvinistic rhetoric and the jingoism that\nBritain portrays, I personally find Britain\nto be an extremely accommodating and\nmulticultural country. My father came\nto this country as a skilled worker and I\nvehemently disagree that the UK seeks\nto bar foreign expertise. In addition, the\ndeportation of EU citizens was brought up.\nThis is something that has not be ratified\nat either table making these statements\ncareless scaremongering. Even if a deal\nhad been reached, it would have to be\nmutually beneficial.\nD\nuring this conversation we\nhave touched upon two\ntopics, each with its own\ncomplexities, each in need\nof far more discussion than\nallowed in a couple of pages.\nOne is the difficulties associated with\nimmigration, the other one is the tensions\nthat Brexit has intensified.\nStarting with immigration: it is a difficult\nprocess. Whether voluntary or not, it\ninvolves abandoning a life and building a\nnew one someplace else. Of course it\u2019s not\nall bad, or bad at all for many migrants,\nyet it remains difficult. But since I\u2019ve left\nhome I realised I\u2019ll never be happy in any\none place ever again. There will always\nbe something missing, whether that\u2019s the\nGreek food and hospitality, or the English\nefficiency and organisation. And then\nthere\u2019s also those things I don\u2019t think I\ncould ever go back to.\nSo yes, we migrate \u201cout of our own\nvolition\u201d. So what? Does making this\nS\nV\nIn the time I\u2019ve been here, I\nhave felt nothing but welcome\nand have never really\nexperienced discrimination\nof any form from the British\npeople or system. This is not\nto say that I haven\u2019t come\nacross bigoted \u2018douchebags\u2019\nof all nationalities but this,\nunfortunately, is a part of life\nas people fall in all parts of the\nspectrum. Instead, I feel I have\nbeen presented with many\nopportunities that I would\nnot have received elsewhere.\nThe article has generalised\nthe entire population based\non a few encounters and thus\ninsulted many who are more\nthan welcoming.\nI am not trying to devalue\nthe opinions or personal\nexperiences of the article\u2019s\nauthor but I feel the\ngeneralisation of the anti-immigrant view of the British\npeople is more few-and-far-between than the article leads\npeople to believe.\ndecision disqualify us from ever discussing\nit again? Should we just shut up and\nkeep our chin up in fear of being called\nungrateful? I think not. No one knows the\nchoices we\u2019ve had to make. You make it\nsound like we came to your home uninvited,\nate your food and spat it out with disdain.\nBut in reality we came to an overpriced,\noverhypedrestaurant.Icametostudyinthe\nUK but let\u2019s not fool ourselves, everything I\ngot from this country, education included, I\neither earned or paid for.\nNow regardless of our contrasting\nfeelings on immigration, one thing is\nundeniable, the climate in the UK has\ndefinitely changed post-Brexit.\nDuring the two weeks before\nand after the referendum,\nreported hate crimes\nincreased by 41% according\nto figures released by the\nHome Office. The government\nkeeps attacking foreign\ndoctors, students and even\ntaxi drivers: particularly when\nit comes down to Europeans\nin the UK \u2013 immigrants with a\nparticularly privileged status\nin this county. Although no\none has straight-up said that\nthere will be deportations,\nthe absence of guarantees\nis stressful. I, for one, do not\nappreciate my livelihood\nbeing dangled like a carrot in\nfront of the EU.\nThe point I was trying to\nmake was that emigration is\nnot easy. It takes a toll on you.\nIt\u2019s usually the better option\nand can in fact be pleasant\nand lead to a fulfilling life (it\noften does, which is why we\u2019ve\nbeen doing it since prehistory).\nBut that doesn\u2019t ever make it\nan easy process, and Brexit\nreally hasn\u2019t helped.\n\\\\ It\u2019s not bad, or bad at\nall for many migrants, yet it\nremains difficult \\\\\n\\\\ I personally find Britain\nto be an extremely\naccommodating and\nmulticultural country \\\\\nImperial Girls\nCan do without\nSport Imperial\n\\\\ Two years in a row,\nthey have created a\ncampaign which only\nperpetuates the idea\nthat women\u2019s sport is\ninferior to men\u2019s \\\\\nTessa Davey is perpetually\ndisappointed by Sport Imperial\u2019s\nattitude to women in sport\nT\nhere are a lot\nof things that\nImperial girls\ncan do, including\nstudying science\nand engineering,\nleading clubs and societies,\nand, presumably, going\nthrough adolescence,\nmeaning that by the time we\u2019re\nat Imperial, we\u2019re probably\nwomen, not girls. But one area\nwhere we seem to be lacking,\naccording to Sport Imperial, is\nin our ability to engage in any\nsporting activities.\nAt first glance, it\u2019s wonderful\nthat Sport Imperial have taken\nup the national \u2018This Girl\nCan\u2019 campaign to encourage\nwomen in sport. The campaign\ncelebrates women doing\nsport because it makes them\nfeel good, regardless of their\nskill level or whether it, god\nforbid, makes their hair stick\nto their sweaty forehead.\nYes, I still hate that the name\nreduces women to \u2018silly little\ngirls\u2019, but on the whole, it does\ngood work. This campaign is\nsadly necessary, as so many\nwomen are discouraged\nfrom sports because all too\noften exercising is seen as\nsomething that a woman can\nonly do in public if she is long,\nlean, and lithe \u2013 after all,\nyou\u2019re embarrassing yourself\nif your belly jiggles as you\nfinish that 10k run. As well as\nuplifting women, This Girl Can\nreminds us that women do\nsport for reasons that aren\u2019t\ncalorie burning or weight loss.\nUnfortunately, in trying to\nbring this to Imperial, Sport\nImperial have seriously\nmisplaced the message.\nTwo years in a row, they have\ncreated a campaign which\nonly perpetrates the idea\nthat women\u2019s sport is inferior\nto men\u2019s, and does nothing\nwhatsoever to encourage\nwomen\u2019s sport.\nFollowing a disastrous\n2015 Varsity, where, for the\nfirst time, a women\u2019s sport\nwas billed as the headline\nmatch, only for the female\nparticipants to be refused the\nperks given to the men, the\nspectators to be prevented\nfrom watching the match,\nand the players to be subject\nto sexist abuse as they were\nstranded at the venue, Sport\nImperial needed to get their\nact together on their attitude\ntowards women\u2019s sport. It was\na case of a great intention\nbeing horribly diverted\nbecause a strong undercurrent\nof sexism prevented it from\nbeing anything other than\njust a publicity stunt. This has\nhappened again with Imperial\nGirls Can.\nMaybe Imperial Girls\nCan would be successful at\nencouraging women into sport\nif they actually thought to tell\nwomen about it. A facebook\nevent shared very sparingly\namongst those who already\nlike and engage with the Sport\nImperial page is not sufficient\nadvertising. Even for those\nof us who already take part\nin Sport Imperial sanctioned\nactivities, whose Wednesday\nBUCSmatchwasappropriated\nas part of this event, were\nbarely made aware of what\nwas happening.\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the bright\npink advertising, for the few\npeople who saw it. I\u2019m told that\nthe colour was chosen in line\nwith the national campaign\n(that I\u2019m pretty sure is not\nentirely pink, but whatever\nhelps you sleep at night, Sport\nImperial), but if they\u2019re so\nobsessed with branding, why\ngo off-brand with a childish\nfont presumably chosen to\nappeal to our unsophisticated\nbrains? Maybe that\u2019s why\nthey advertised several of the\nevents with images of men \u2013\ntrue athletes \u2013 to inspire us.\nAnd don\u2019t forget, ladies, that\nthese classes are a great way\nto burn calories. And burn\ncalories we shall, only taking\npart in gimmicky sessions like\nZombie Zumba and Spooky\nSpin. Forget sports, Sport\nImperial thinks that the only\nreason women exercise is for\ntheir personal fitness, rather\nthan because of a passion for\nan activity.\nCuriously, two years in\na row, Imperial Girls Can\nhas also served to create a\nsystematic discrimination on\nbehalf of the Union. Every\nweek, the Union minibuses\nare overbooked, and they\u2019re\nallocated to those travelling\nthe furthest distance. With the\nImperial Girls Can matches\nbeing moved to Heston, the\n(incrementally) nearest of the\nsportsgrounds, this means\nthat on the day meant to be\ncelebrating their sport, the\nwomen are denied access to a\nfacility that they would have,\nhad Sport Imperial not been\nthrowing this event. This was\nraised as a problem last year\nbut occurred in exactly the\nsame way on Wednesday, as\nthose forced to participate in\nthis event are clearly only an\nafterthought in the planning.\nI love a free t-shirt and cup\nof hot chocolate, and it\u2019s great\nfor so many athletic women to\nget together and be inspired\nby each other. But we are\nwomen already very invested\nin our sport \u2013 we\u2019ve already\n\\\\ A strong\nundercurrent of\nsexism prevented it\nfrom being anything\nother than a\npublicity stunt \\\\\nhad to learn not to care about\nhow our sport is perceived. It\ndoes nothing to encourage the\nwomen who struggle to get\ninto sport, and is patronising at\nbest to those who are. At least\nthis year they dropped the free\ngift to women\u2019s rugby of non-contact mouthguards. Despite\nSport Imperial handling our\nfixtures, they don\u2019t seem to\nhave got the memo that we\nplay full contact rugby.

These words were\nuttered by Donald Trump\ntowards the end of the third\nand final election debate,\nin a contest that has been\ndefined by mud-slinging,\npress-madness, and all-round\nfeelings of dread. While\nanswering a question about\ntax increases for the wealthy,\nHillary Clinton made a jab\nabout Trump\u2019s likely tax\nevasion; half way through her\nanswer, Trump leaned into the\nmicrophone, and pointedly\nsaid the words \u2018such a nasty\nwoman\u2019, closely followed by\n\u2018your husband disagrees with\nyou\u2019.\nWhile many may pale at\nthe idea of another Clinton\npresidency \u2013 both liberals\nand conservatives alike \u2013\nthis seemed to be a new\nlow for Trump. In one fell\nswoop, Trump had defined\nClinton, who was Secretary\nof State for four years, as her\nhusband\u2019s subject, and alienated many women voters.\nSeemingly instantaneously,\nproducts sprung up across the\nweb: nasty woman t-shirts,\nbadges, and Halloween costumes emerged overnight, to\ncomplete any liberal feminist\u2019s\noutfit. But what do we mean\nwhen we say \u2018nasty woman\u2019?\nThe term \u2018nasty\u2019, while\ntechnically genderless, to me\nalways seems to be applied\nmore often to women than\nmen \u2013 why is this? As usual,\nI took to the silver screen to\ntry and answer my questions\nfor me.\nFor me, when someone uses\nthe epithet \u2018nasty woman\u2019, it\ncomes from a place of deep\ninsecurity, from a fear of an\ninversion of the traditional\npatriarchal power structures\nin society. As such, when\nthinking about the role \u2018nasty\nwomen\u2019 play in cinema, the\nfirst film that springs to mind is\nthe 1954 Nicholas Ray classic\nJohnny Guitar, a techni-colour fever dream of a\nWestern. Despite being\nnamed after the gun-slinger, Johnny Guitar\nactually centres around\nVienna (Joan Crawford), a saloonkeeper in\nhigh-waisted trousers who\nmaintains a difficult relationship with the townspeople.\nAs Michael Newton writes,\nJohnny Guitar \u2018operates at an\nuncomfortable pitch of excess\nand emotional extremity\u2019.\nVienna, with her self-owned\nbusiness, and a plot of land\nthat stands to become a lot\nmore valuable when the\nrailroad is laid down, has economic power over the men in\nher life, and is able to maintain\na fierce independence. She is\nunder the bus to get what\nshe wants. Priestly doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily have economic\npower over others (although\nshe is very wealthy), rather\nher power is more cultural \u2013\nshe is a tastemaker, one who\ncan see through the cogs\nand labyrinth of the fashion\nindustry to explain why that\ncertain shade of cerulean has\nbecome so popular. While\nthe film doesn\u2019t explicitly\ntouch on it, it\u2019s not difficult\nto see the difference in perception between Priestly and\nGordon Gecko, the broker\nat the centre of the 1987 film\nWall Street: while Priestly is\na \u2018nasty woman\u2019, Gecko is\n\u2013 like Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s\ncharacter in The Wolf of\nWall Street \u2013 more of\nan antihero, someone\nwe root for despite our-selves. Despite having\nsimilar characters, the\nway we empathise\nwith these characters\nis resoundly different,\nsomething that is difficult to\nseparate from their gender.\nSimilarly, in Michael\nClayton, the 2007 thriller,\nTilda Swinton plays Karen\nCrowder, the general counsel\nof an agricultural products\nconglomerate, analogous\nto Monsanto. Crowder\u2019s\ncompany is represented\nby a prestigious law firm,\nfor whom Michael Clayton\n(George Clooney) acts as a\n\u2018fixer\u2019; things turn awry when\nIn defence of \u2018nasty women\u2019\nnobody\u2019s fool, and takes no\nprisoners, refusing to succumb\nto sentimentalism \u2013 as such she\nis one incarnation of the \u2018nasty\nwoman\u2019.\nBut the power dynamic can\nmanifest itself in different\nways. In The Devil Wears\nPrada, Meryl Streep plays\nMiranda Priestly, the editor of\nRunway, and a thinly-veiled\nrepresentation of Vogue\neditor Anna Wintour. Priestly\nis an arch-bitch, known for\nher chilly nature, and excessive demands on her personal\nClayton happens across a\ndocument obtained by his\ndead colleague, which shows\nthe company manufactured\na weed killer they knew was\ncarcinogenic. As she tries\nto cover up her company\u2019s\nreputation, Crowder resorts\nto more desperate measures,\nincluding fraud and murder.\nSwinton earned an Oscar\nfor her portrayal, which was\nfull of nuance and sympathy\n\u2013 even though Crowder was\nthe complete villain of the\nfilm, Swinton still managed to\nfind space to build up a fully\nrealised character, showing\nus that the \u2018nasty woman\u2019\nlabel is one that (even if it is\napplicable) reduces a woman\ndown to a single character-istic, and refuses to allow for\nany measure of depth.\nThe closest comparison\nto Clinton, and possibly the\nnearest thing cinema has\nto the archetypical political\n\u2018nasty woman\u2019, can be found\nin the character of Tracy\nFlick from Alexander Payne\u2019s\nseminal 1999 film Election.\nStarring Reese Witherspoon\nas Tracy, Election centres\naround a Nebraskan high\nschool\u2019s student body\nelection, and the trials and\ntribulations it brings. Tracy\nis the brightest student in the\nschool, with an insufferable\nair of self-importance, and\na desire to get herself on as\nmany committees as possible;\nshe\u2019s got an overbearing\nsecretary Andrea (Anne\nHathaway); although the film\nattempts to let us see a softer\nside of Priestly, we are left\nwith no doubts about what\nkind of person she is \u2013 one\nwho is willing to throw others\n\\\\Warner Brothers\n\\\\Comedy Central \\\\Republic Pictures\nThe new film by the FrenchCanadian auteuer at the top of\nhis game arrives at cinemas next\nFriday\nH\nugh Jackman\n\u2013was it as scary\nto work with\nhim in Prisoners\nas it looked?\nWhat the\nwere all the spiders about\nin Enemy? And how the hell\ndo you pronounce that last\nname?! There are many\nquestions we\u2019d love to ask\nDenis Villeneuve, the man\nwho\u2019s gone from abduction\ndrama to existential horror to\nwar-crime thriller to thought-provoking sci-fi - all in the\nspace of the last three years.\nSadly, he\u2019s a little busy at the\nmoment, so he wasn\u2019t around\nto answer them. But, with his\nlatest feature Arrival being\nreleased in the UK next week,\nwe figured we had enough\nof a reason to nerd out over\nhim and his work anyway.\nHere is a short profile of the\nman and his filmography;\na three-time winner of the\nAcademy of Canadian\nCinema and Television Best\nFilm award and Genie Award\nfor Best Direction, future\ndirector of the sequel to the\nscience fiction classic Blade\nRunner, and all-round great\nfilmmaker.\nEarly Career\nBorn in Gentilly, Quebec,\nVilleneuve had been making\nshort films for many years before rising to stardom. At the\nage of 23, he won La Course\nEurope-Asie 1990-91, a youth\nfilm competition hosted by\nRadio-Canada.\nMaelstr\u00f6m (2001)\nThe appearance of Maelstr\u00f6m across various festivals\nworldwide in 2001, including\nthe Toronto International\nFilm Festival where it won\nBest Canadian Film, was\nwhen Villeneuve\u2019s arthouse\nbreakthrough occurred. An\nengrossingly dark and yet\nquirky comic tale, it follows\nthe depressed alcoholic Bibiane struggle to keep things\ntogether, as a hit-and-run\naccident leaves her situation\nlooking bleaker than ever. It\ndelves deep into the meaning\nunderneath the apparently\nglossy surface of the life she\nhas come to lead, and won\nfive Genie awards including\nBest Motion Picture. Oh - and\nit\u2019s narrated by a fish that\u2019s\nwaiting to be chopped up for\nfood. What\u2019s not to like?\nPolytechnique (2009)\nEvidently Villeneuve was\nonce not as prolific a filmmaker as he seems to be now.\nMade eight years after his\nbreakthrough, with nothing\nbetween save for the short\nfilm Next Floor in 2008 (which\nwon the Short Film Palme\nD\u2019Or at the Cannes Film\nFestival),it was nonetheless\nalso very successful, winning\nnine Genie awards including\nBest Director and Best Motion\nPicture. A rather more controversial film than Maelstr\u00f6m,\nit dramatises the events of the\nDecember 1989 \u201cMontreal\nMassacre\u201d, when a young\nman walked into the \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique in Montreal and\nshot 28 people, killing 14, and\nspecifically targeted women.\nOne critic said that though\nit seemed like a paradox to\nsay so, Villeneuve had turned\nthe events of that day into \u201ca\nwork of profound beauty\u201d.\nIncendies (2010)\nIncendies was where Villeneuve\u2019s career really kicked\noff. Garnering huge critical\nacclaim at both the Venice\nand Toronto film festivals,\nit went on to be selected to\nrepresent Canada in the Academy Awards\u2019 Best Foreign\nLanguage Film category, and\nwas ultimately selected as\none of the five nominees for\nWith stars like Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Paul\nDano and Viola Davis on\nboard, Villeneuve was finally\nswinging in the big leagues\nof Hollywood when the\nrelease of Prisoners rolled\naround. Thankfully he didn\u2019t\nlet the fame get to him, and\nthis dense, dark slow-burn-ing thriller is one of the most\ncaptivating works he\u2019s put to\nthe screen. Set in the damp,\nsnow-slurried suburbs of Pennsylvania at thanksgiving, it follows Keller Dover (Jackman),\nhis wife Grace (Maria Bello),\nand their friends Franklin and\nNancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Davis respectively)\nas their peaceful livelihoods\nare shattered by the disappearance of their children.\nWhen the active detective Loki\n(Gyllenhaal) finds a suspect\n(Dano), Keller decides to take\nmatters into his own hands. It\u2019s\na film that works as a thriller,\na mystery, a crime drama\nand a dual character study,\nperfectly capturing the unravelling of Keller and Loki as\nthey hit dead end after dead\nend. Prisoners received critical\nacclaim in the USA and established Villeneuve as a talent to\nbe watched closely.\nEnemy (2013)\nAs if to counteract this newly\nestablished fame, Villeneuve\nreleased Enemy almost\nimmediately after Prisoners.\nThe film is a much shorter\naffair than its predecessor,\nbut is more complex and less\nmainstream. When Adam Bell\n(Jake Gyllenhaal, not only\ndoubling up on Villeneuve\nfilms but here doubling up\non lead roles as Adam and\nAnthony Claire) rents out a\nfilm on the recommendation\nof a colleague, he recognises\nan extra who looks eerily\nsimilar to him - looking him\nup, he finds that he is Anthony\nClaire, a man who appears\nto be his doppelg\u00e4nger. The\ncataclysmic events that are\nset in motion when he sets out\nto find his mysterious likeness\nbegin to tear apart the fabric\nof Adam and Anthony\u2019s lives.\nThe enigmatic but brilliatn-ly-used motif of spiders is one\nof the film\u2019s most uniquely\nchilling aspects - and Villeneuve clearly wanted it to be\nkept that way, as part of the\ncast\u2019s contractual agreements\nwas that none of them were\nto disclose the meaning of the\nspiders to the public.\nSicario (2015)\nThe work that cemented\nVilleneuve\u2019s status as the foremost craftsman of thought-pro-voking thrills working in Hollywood today can be found\nin Sicario, a war-crime-drama\nabout the painful futility of an\nindividual\u2019s quest to do the\nright thing in the face of the\nmachine of war. Emily Blunt\nstars as crack FBI agent Kate\nMacer, assigned to a mission\nby CIA officer Matt Graver\n(Josh Brolin) to apprehend\na cartel operative. When\nKate meets Matt\u2019s mysterious\npartner Alejandro (Benicio\ndel Toro) and a routine bor-der-crossing pickup operation\nturns into one of the most\nintense traffic jams in cinema\nhistory, Kate begins to realise\nthat this is much more than a\nsimple arrest.\nTom Stephens\nthe award. It follows a pair of\ntwins who, after their mother\u2019s\ndeath, learn from her will that\nthey have a brother they did\nnot know existed, and that\ntheir presumed-dead father is\nstill alive. When they travel to\nan unnamed Middle-Eastern\ncountry to find their family\nand learn more about their\nmother\u2019s past, a series of flashbacks begin to render their\nmother\u2019s story more clearly.\nThe binds of family and the\nhorrors of the past weave together to form a breathtakingly complex and heartbreaking\ncinematic tapestry.\nPrisoners (2013)\nA beginner\u2019s guide to Denis Villeneuve\n\\\\ Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images\n\\\\ He has managed\nto turn the events of\na school massacre\ninto \u201ca work of\nprofound beauty\u201d \\\\\n\n"

I don\u2019t know what to do \u2013 I\u2019m surrounded by Trump\nsupporters! My friends and family all want to \u2018make America great again\u2019. Since they\u2019ve followed Trump\u2019s interviews\nand rallies, I\u2019ve had to deal with my roommates blaming\neverything from our leaky roof to our broken boiler on our\nMexican neighbours from across the street. It\u2019s embarrass-ing. Everything is so nonsensical I just don\u2019t know where\nto start. I can\u2019t even reason with them; I find it impossible\nto participate in a debate where the person I\u2019m talking to\nchanges their mind about what their point was every five\nminutes. It\u2019s even destroying my relationship - I can\u2019t sleep\nwith my girlfriend knowing that he also wants to fuck over\nthe country.\nYours,\nCint\nHey Clint!\nHmm, I think you\u2019re going about this the wrong\nway. You have clearly found yourself in a\nsituation where your opinions are different to\nthose around you. Perhaps your life would be\neasier if you found a way to agree with your\nfriends and family? Maybe you should take\nmore time to try to understand Trump\u2019s appeal.\nStaying true to yourself is overrated and not\nmuch fun, so instead of sticking up for what\nyou believe in, just give over and give up! Your\nidentity should be malleable to whoever is\naround you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a personal-ity; It\u2019s personalised to every individual you\ninteract with. There\u2019s no point trying to accept\nyour differences and move on. You must eradicate them for every human, ever.\nHOROSCOPES\nLife is about compromises (of your whole self).\nIf you really, really can\u2019t shake the unnecessary\nidea of being \u2018yourself\u2019, I guess your only other\noption is to become a total recluse, or find\na whole host of new friends and family that\nagree with you about everything. The people\nyou surround yourself should be an echo\nchamber of your own views. If a conversation\nisn\u2019t a game of parroting back to one another,\nyou\u2019re doing it wrong! Same goes for your\nsocial media timelines: if you see anything you\ndislike, ever, just unfriend! That\u2019s why there\u2019s\nno dislike button \u2013 just delete everything you\nwouldn\u2019t say yourself.\nI hope you don\u2019t mind me writing to you from\nacross the pond.\nMuch love\nChris xxxxx\n\n"

The\nLondon Olympics,\n(almost) the end of\nthe world and the\nlast US presidential\nelection? Well fast\nforward four years and we\u2019ve\nhad another set of Olympics,\nanother election cycle is\ncoming to a climax and, if you\nbelieve everything people are\nsaying on Twitter, the world is\ncoming to its end if either of the\nfrontrunning candidates wins\nthe race to the White House.\nBut what does it all mean I\nhear you ask, who\u2019s running,\nwhat are they running for, and\nhow on earth have we got to\nthis point? Shhhh it\u2019s going to\nbe all right. Matt\u2019s here.\nHow did we get here?\nThe United States has quite\na complex system of selection\nrounds to get down to its final\ncandidates for each party.\nA system which involves \u2018primaries\u2019 and \u2018caucuses\u2019 which\ncan be either open or closed.\nThese spawn delegates (which\nare assigned via various forms\nof witchcraft), some \u2018superdelegates\u2019 are thrown into the\nmix, and then at each party\u2019s\nconvention their presidential\ncandidate is chosen.\nRealistically only the Democrat and Republican nominees\nhave any chance of winning\nand the rest may not even get\na single electoral college vote\n(more on this later). Some\nweird complications and quirks\nof the rules could gift the\noutsiders the presidency but\ntake it as the next president\nwill almost definitely be either\nDonald Trump or Hillary\nClinton. (A more in depth look\nat the selection system can be\nfound in felix 1624.)\nThe candidates\nthe forefront of the news over\nthe past few months, at times\neven superseding the fallout\nof Brexit. The businessman,\nformer Apprentice host, and\nhair spray enthusiast has\npitched himself as an outsider,\nsomeone to challenge the\ncurrent way of doing politics.\nThis is factually true as Trump\nhas never held elected office,\nbeen a federal government\nofficial or held a high ranking\nmilitary post (all other presidents have).\nDelving deeper into Trump\nwe see some more worrying statements on women,\nMexicans and Muslims (and\nthese are just the headlining\nones). From a blanket ban\non Muslims entering the US\nto \u2018help\u2019 combat terrorism,\nto bragging about sexual\nassault in the infamous \u2018pussy\ngrabbing\u2019 audio from 2005,\nit\u2019s been a campaign that even\nMalcolm Tucker would find\nhard to spin (Nigel Farage did\ngive it a shot though). But he\nstill, even as these deplorable\ncharacter traits have come to\nlight, is polling at around 45%\nof the popular vote. But why?\nBecause in some cases voters\nare willing to overlook these\nthings.\nFor the sects of the American\npopulation that feel disenfranchised with current politics and\nfor whom the current government is nowhere near helping\nthem, Trump is seen in some\nrespects as a chance-at-turn-ing-this-around move. People\nare witnessing banks and corporations prospering far more\nthan themselves and want to\nchange the shift of power back\nto the citizens. Any precedent\nfor this happening? *cough*\nBrexit *cough*.\nTrump is also the Republican nomination and huge\nswathes of the US are very\nconservative and socially\nright wing. Looking over\nhis personal views people\ndo agree with some of his\nstances. Or do they? Well\nthat depends which interview\nand statement you believe\nof his. He\u2019s been pro and\nanti gun legislation, pro and\nanti abortion and has been\nvery economical with the\ntruth regarding his business\ndealings. He even claimed, in\na hard hitting 1990 interview\nwith Playboy, that if he were\nto run, it would most likely be\non a Democratic platform.\nHas Trump changed his\nmind over the years, is he a\nsecret centrist politician, or is\nhe simply just pandering to\nwhoever is listening to him?\nThe only way we\u2019ll likely find\nout either way, is if he gets\ninto office, so in the words of\nTrump/Dale Winton, \u201cBring\non the wall!\u201d\nDonald Trump\nThe man needs almost no\nintroduction and has been at\nGary Johnson\nAs the Libertarian Party\ncandidate, Johnson\u2019s policies\nare largely that government\nshould take as little interest\nin the lives of its subjects as\npossible. Johnson seems\nto be taking the same\nHillary Clinton\nAt a glance, Clinton seems\na pretty good candidate. She\nhas experience in politics, as\nFirst Lady with her husband\nBill in the 1990\u2019s, later as a\nNew York senator, and then\nas Secretary of State under\nObama. She has also been\nheavily involved in The Clinton Foundation, a charitable\norganisation funding projects\nworldwide on a whole host\nof issues. Sounds wonderful,\nright? Well kinda. There\u2019s\nmore to some of these points\nthan meets the eye. Clinton\nas Secretary of State was\n\u2018responsible\u2019 for the Benghazi incident (in which four\nAmericans were killed in a US\ndiplomatic outpost in Libya,\nincluding the ambassador)\nand this has been set upon by\ncritics who sense a cover-up/\nscandal (not implausible).\nLike with most 70-year-olds,\nemails aren\u2019t Hillary\u2019s strong\npoint. In essence, emails\nshouldn\u2019t have been on certain servers and then emails\nwere deleted when they\nshouldn\u2019t have been. An FBI\ninvestigation was launched,\nno sanctions were brought\nagainst her, but it\u2019s an\nongoing saga. If it escalates\nwhile she\u2019s in office it could\npotentially lead to impeach-ment. Trump could also have\nthe same happen should\nhe be found guilty of fraud\nregarding Trump University\n(really) in a trial that starts\nlater this year.\nHer relationship with Wall\nStreet has come under fire\ntoo. After giving a set of\nspeeches to Goldman Sachs\nas part of her foundation\u2019s\nwork, how disconnected from\nthem she really is remains to\nbe seen. Clinton\u2019s stance on\nSyria and no fly zones could\n(key word being could) send\nthe US into a conflict with\nRussian forces in tandem with\nSyria and would involve large\nscale military deployments.\nWar with Russia isn\u2019t ideal\n(duh) but like Trump, she\u2019s\nbeen known to flip flop over\nthe years and whether this\npolicy would stand, only time\nwill tell.\n\\\\ Like with most\n70-year-olds, emails\naren\u2019t Hillary\u2019s\nstrong point \\\\\nEven the Capitol Building is looking apocalyptic \\\\ Stephen Melkisethian\non complex issues. Johnson is\nvery heavily pro legalisation\nof marijuana (all drugs actu-ally) and has forced himself\nto quit smoking pot during his\ncampaign. (How reassuring\nthat this is, him on peak form.)\nHe\u2019s the perennial third party\ncandidate/protest vote and\nwill likely garner a single\ndigit chunk of the vote but no\nelectoral college votes.\nJill Stein\nStein, an ex-Physician, has\ngrand plans to eradicate\nstudent debt, ensure that the\nUS runs on clean and green\nenergy by 2030 (no nuclear\nallowed), and take action on\nclimate change. Essentially\nshe\u2019s the antithesis of Johnson\non most issues, campaigning\non a ticket that includes a $15\nminimum wage (that\u2019s about\n\u00a35 \u00a320 \u00a315 an hour for all of\nyou keeping track at home),\ndemilitarised borders in order\nto not deter immigration, and\nan increase in gun-control\nmeasures. Similarity comes in\nthe form of being a long shot\nfor the big job, Stein is polling\neven lower than Johnson\nand is not even on the ballot\npaper in some states.\nEvan McMullin\nMcMullin has slipped under\nthe radar, even to most Americans, but this isn\u2019t a worry\nfor him. His main appeal\nlies solely in his home state\nof Utah where the typically\nRepublican state isn\u2019t best\npleased with Trump. Instead\nthey see McMullin\u2019s politics\nand his Mormon faith as a\nbetter alternative than either\nof the main two candidates.\nBecause McMullin is not affiliated with any specific political\nparty, should he win he would\nbecome the first non-parti-san candidate since George\nWashington in 1792 to win a\nstate. How exciting.\nOverall, not the greatest\nbunch of candidates the US\nhas ever had.\n\\\\ Handy if you\u2019re\na convict, Richard\nNixon or a turkey \\\\\nThe United States employs\na weird system in which a\ncandidate needs to win a\nmajority of the 538 votes up\nfor grabs in the \u2018electoral\ncollege\u2019. Each of the 50 states\nhas two Senators and then\na varying number of districts\n(anywhere from 1 to 53) each\nwith a representative who sits\nin the aptly named House of\nRepresentatives. The number\nof districts a state has is\ndetermined by its population\nand the average district holds\n710,000 eligible voters.\nBecause these lines are\nonly redrawn every ten years\nand the number of people\nof voting age (18+) changes\nover this period, all votes\naren\u2019t created equal. This\nbecomes even more so when\nyou chuck in the rounding of\nvotes (as each state must have\na whole number of representatives and hence votes) and\nthe two bonus, Senator, votes\nthat every state gets.\nBut wait, 435 + (2 x 50) =\n535 electoral college votes,\nnot 538. In addition there\u2019s\nWashington DC which does\nnot actually lie in a state but\ninstead is it\u2019s own district, the\nDistrict of Columbia (not to\nbe confused the University\nof Columbia or indeed the\ncountry of Colombia). This\ndistrict gets 3 votes, taking the\ntotal to 538.\nEach state then goes to\nthe polls on the first Tuesday\nin November (postponed a\nweek if it\u2019s November 1st\nlike\nthis year) and the winner\nof each state wins all the\nelectoral college votes for\nthat state. As with everything\nin the US election there\u2019s\nalways exceptions, this time\nit\u2019s Maine and Nebraska.\nThese award their two senate\nvotes to the overall winner in\nthe state and then the winner\nof each district gets that\ndistrict\u2019s vote. What the whole\nsystem also means is that a\ncandidate could win the most\nnumber of actual votes in the\nUS and still lose the majority\nof electoral college votes and\nhence the overall race. This\nhappened famously in 2000\n(after a recount in Florida\nmeant less than 600 votes\ndecided the president) as well\nas in 1876 and 1888.\napproach with current events,\nshowcased by his \u201cwhat is\nAleppo?\u201d comment in an\ninterview about the conflict in\nSyria. This isn\u2019t the first time\nhe\u2019s been perplexed in an\ninterview mind you, he\u2019s been\noblivious as to what the Trans\nPacific Partnership entailed,\nstruggled to name a foreign\nleader, and been generally\nsketchy on knowing details\nThe actual race\nWith the winner takes all\nsystem, the most populous\nstates of (California, Texas\netc) are heavily targeted\nin the race and the smaller\nstates are often forgotten\nabout. Swing states, in which\nthe race is tight, are priori-tised too as capturing voters\nhere is far more important\nthan losing by a bit less in the\nstates you\u2019re almost guaranteed to lose.\nLong story short, barring\nany massive surge from third\nparties, it\u2019ll become a two\nhorse race to win 270 electoral college votes and sweep\nthe presidency. In the unlikely\n(but ever increasing) chance\nthat they tie, then the House\nof Representatives will choose\nthe next US president out of\nthe top 3 candidates with\nThe way the US government is set up, it\u2019s designed\nto be slow and inefficient.\nThe House of Representatives\nand the Senate (collectively\nknown as Congress) each\nhave to pass any motions the\npresident tries to enact and\nif they\u2019re controlled by the\nopposition party then compromises have to be made at\nthe very least. The president\ndoes have a lot of sway as a\nperson though and above all\nhas a presidential veto on any\nmotion that passes Congress\n(mostly).\nThe president is also the\nCommander in Chief of\nthe military and has the\npower over them to do with\nas he sees fit (mostly). The\nmost important thing for us\nnon-Americans is the diplomatic power the President\nhas, the power to negotiate\nExecutive Agreements (kind\nof like treaties), and other\nforeign policy stuff. Presidential pardons are also a pretty\npowerful thing the President\ncan use, handy if you\u2019re a\nconvict, Richard Nixon or a\nturkey.\nPolling officially starts in\nsome places at midnight in\ntheir state\u2019s time zone (4am\nTuesday GMT) and within a\nfew minutes the results of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire\nwill be released due to their\nelectorate being around 20.\nAround six hours later (10am\nGMT) the rest of the country\u2019s\npolling stations will begin to\nopen over six time zones and\nwill start closing anywhere\nfrom 7pm to 8pm local time\n(11pm to 4am GMT) and then\nafter that states are called\npretty rapidly. Usually by\naround 5am the result should\nbe known but any legal\nchallenges in the event of a\nclose race could drag on for\na while.

Paul is\nhighly popular amongst the\nstudent body, despite his lack\nof clear qualifications for the\nrole of president; his speech\nto the students in hustings is\nmeandering, and made up\nentirely of platitudes about\nhow he worked through\nbreaking his leg and scored\na winning touchdown against\nWestside School. Paul is also\nenormously wealthy, with his\ncement-baron father furnishing his comfortable lifestyle.\nSound familiar?\nThe comparison between\nElection and this current election cycle couldn\u2019t really be\nclearer. There\u2019s even a Gary\nJohnson-esque character to\nbe found in Tammy Meltzer\n(Jessica Campbell), who runs\nas an anti-authoritarian can-didate, questioning the very\nprocess of the election. And,\nI\u2019m not the first one to think\nso: The Atlantic, Huffington\nPost, and The Cut have all run\narticles about the uncanny\ncomparison. Like Clinton, Flick\nis a woman with an extremely\nprolific track record, who is\nclearly very intelligent and\nastute, but has difficulties\nconnecting emotionally with\nher electorate. As Tracy says\nherself in the film: \u2018The pressures women face mean you\nhave to work twice as hard,\nand you can\u2019t let anything or\nanyone stand in your way.\u2019\nBut Trump is no Paul\nMetzler, and this isn\u2019t high\nschool. What makes Tracy\nsuch a ridiculous character\nis that she doesn\u2019t seem to\nunderstand how little the high\nschool election matters: she is\nseen as cut-throat and bitchy\nagainst the others simply\nbecause they refuse to take\nthings as seriously as she\ndoes. But while Tracy might\nseem like a nasty woman in\nthe course of the film, really\nthat behaviour is par for the\ncourse in the political arena,\nsomething we realise when\nMr McAllister attempts to sabotage her campaign, in order\nto teach her a lesson. What\nmakes Tracy a \u2018nasty woman\u2019\nis really simply what makes\na politician a politician:\nsteadfastness, competitive-ness, and a general disregard\nfor others. To call Clinton a\n\u2018nasty woman\u2019 is to imply that\nTrump is virtuous, that he has\nthe moral high-ground; Trump\nmay claim that he has business acumen, all his own hair,\nand a huge dick, but claiming\na higher sense of morals than\nClinton might be a bridge too\nfar.\n\\\\Paramount Pictures\nV\niolent. Destructive.\nCatastrophic.\nThese may be the\nwords you think of\nwhen encountering\nthe word volcano.\nWerner Herzog, one of the\nworld\u2019s most influential directors,\ntogether with volcanologist Clive\nOppenheimer, take you on a trip\nto the heart of the earth, with\nthe question: are volcanoes all\ndestructive?\nFrom Pacific islands to North\nKorea, this film shows how volcanoes help to construct people\u2019s\nbelief systems. Some are very\nmystical, such as the belief that\nspirits live in the lava and communicate with the local villagers.\nVolcanoes are often perceived to\nbe a source of power with these\nbeliefs so firmly ingrained into\nthe societies that in some villages,\ntourists are not permitted into the\narea after an eruption as the fire\nspirit would not recognize them\nand would be angry.\nThe film explains why people\nform such beliefs; volcanoes are\nmysterious and unpredictable.\nWe feel helpless due to our lack\nof control over them and even\narmed with cutting-edge technologies and equipment, we still\ncan\u2019t fully explain the fascinating\npower of nature. Just as Herzog\nsaid after his observation of volca-noes: \u201cThere\u2019s no permanence to\nwhat we are doing, no permanence to the efforts of human\nbeings\u201d \u2013 we are insignificant\ncompared to its power. As a result,\nwe respond with respect and awe.\nVolcanoes both destroy and create\nand are shown to carry sufficient\nenergy to fulfil all human needs.\nWhen facing something this\npowerful, the first reaction is to\nrun as fast as you can to avoid\nbeing swallowed and absorbed\nby the mighty force. The next is to\npray; before a disaster, for safety\nand good health; after, for peace\nof mind and rejuvenation. This is\nshown to be true for all natural\ndisasters. Some survivors of floods,\nfor example, bring tributes to the\n\u2018God of the Sea\u2019 in exchange for a\npeaceful year. Amidst the spiritual\nbeliefs, people learn to predict\nand prepare for future disasters.\nInterestingly these natural disasters\nwhile being immensely destructive also help to form human\nculture, beliefs and creativity. This\ncomparison is emphasised by the\ndirector frequently pairing the\nviolent ocean with the exploding\nvolcanoes to give a strong visual\ncontrast. The dance of the fire\nsynchronises with the rhythm of\nthe waves, expressing the infinite\npower of nature in front of our\neyes. While listening to\npeaceful harmonious classical\nbackground music, one can\nfeel the strong impact of\nlava being pushed out of the\ncrater, like spirits fighting for\ntheir freedom.\n\u2018Into the Inferno\u2019 exposes\nhow fragile human beings\nare in the face of nature\nwhilst also showing us to be\nconscious and wise creatures.\nThese harsh conditions make\nus who we are, just as the\nselective pressure which has\nevolved us to Homo Sapiens\nin these two million years.\nWe evolve creative solutions\ntowards difficulties. We learnt\nfrom birds to fly, we learnt\nfrom bats to use ultrasound\nwaves to create radar sys-tems. Humans always learn\nfrom nature and create tools\nto face challenges.\nThe documentary ends on\nan ominous prediction by the\nleader of the Endu village,\nChief Mael, \u201c Volcanoes will\ndestroy everything. They will\ndestroy the whole world\u201d.\nWhat do you think the future\nof human and volcano will\nbe?\nInto the\nInferno\nBy Theo Farah\nHerzog stares into the abyss\\\\ Netflix\nDOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK\n\n"

They follow this with\nPork Soda, which unexpectedly involves the throwing\nof a pineapple from stage to\ncrowd.\nGlass Animals are massive\nand for a very good reason:\nE\nntering the venue,\nthe mood of the\nnight to come\nseemed to emanate\nthroughout. Huge\nTetris shaped lights\nhang high above the stage,\nglowing a bright orange/\nyellow light across the\ngrowing audience. After a\nshort entrance, the band\nwastes no time before\njumping into their first song,\nLife Itself \u2013 a catchy, drum-heavy song that entices you\nto dance along. The front-man, Dave Bayley, starts\nleaping around the stage\nwhile sending his voice flying\nacross the venue in almost\nflawless tone and clarity.\nHaving grabbed the attention of the crowd and set the\nenergetic mood of the show,\nthe band quickly plunges\ninto more great songs from\nboth their albums, including\nSeason 2 Episode 3 \u2013 giving\noff an odd romantic ballad\nvibe to the crowd - Gooey,\nYouth, and Black Mambo to\nname a few. The set list allows\nfor no dull moments or times\nof rest from the onslaught\nof catchy lyrics, mindless\ndance-inducing beats and\nsounds, and vibrant visuals\nemanating from the Tetris\nblock lights and lit up desert\nA\nvery bad\npresentiment\nseized us when\nwe stepped\ninto Grande\nhalle de la\nVillette : one pint of Heineken\ncost seven euros and it\nseemed like Heineken was the\nonly sponsor of the event. We\nwent to see Flavien Berger, a\nFrench musician that neither\nof us had listened to before,\nbut he somehow became the\nsurprise of the day. His deep\nraspy voice melded with the\nfunky beats and spaced out\nsynths in an eccentric yet\ncoherent way. As my friend\nAlicia, who just moved to\nParis, got excited about the\nsuccessful exploration of\nFrench music, we gradually\nforgot about booze issues\nand became confident that\nthe level of soberness would\nnot affect the experience at\nall.\nInstead of just \u2018pressing play\non the stage\u2019 as Alicia put\nit, the collaboration of Todd\nTerje and the Olsens performed excellent disco covers\nof some classical electronic\npieces including Firecracker\nfrom Japanese electronic trio\nYMO. In the end, it was the\ndisco version of Inspector\nNorse that finally got the\ncrowd going. The day finished\nwith Moderat. The mind-blow-ing stage effects made it the\nbest performance of the day,\nbut that\u2019s what you\u2019d expect\nfrom Moderat.\nOn day twoI was looking\nforward to M.I.A, my\ncelebrity crush, but her\nperformance was surprisingly\nunderwhelming. Instead of\nsinging, she just talked to the\ncrowd for most of the set.\nThere was no bass at all and\nher sound was too weak to\nbe heard sometimes. As we\nall got very disappointed\nwe thought that the day was\npretty much doomed, but\nthe electronic session after\nmidnight saved everything.\nIt started with the symbolic\nquirky melodies from Acid\nArabic, followed by a twist of\nhard techno and disco from\nMotor City Drum Ensemble.\nThe vibe was then refreshed\nby Daphni, the side project\nfrom Caribou. The epitome of\nthe rebellion against predictable mainstream EDM, it was\nthe best music to dance to\nwhen sober and surrounded\nby those who aren\u2019t.\nFor the first day everyone\nwas well-behaved. Alicia said\nthat it was a Paris thing; Parisians don\u2019t need drugs and\nalcohol to enjoy themselves.\nAnd then there we were on\nday two, stood in the middle\nof the crowd watching people\naround us getting high and\nlosing themselves.\n\u2018We are in England again.\u2019\nAlicia turned around and said\nto me.\nPeople aren\u2019t that different\nafter all.\n\\\\ Philipp Antonas\n\\\\ Ellen Zheng\nPitchfork\nMusic Festival\nParis\nBy Ellen Zheng\nThis down to earth outfit talks Glastonbury, being Kylie\nsuper-fans, and what\u2019s next after a huge 2016.\nTheo Farah\n\\\\ \u201cIf people said\nFormation were a\ncountry-funk band,\nwe\u2019d be like \u2018not\nreally\u2019\u201d \\\\\nthe place is massive.

Surely our lives\nare just as interesting and\ninteractive? Why were so\nmany people attracted to this\nworld?\nSocial Life. First let\u2019s look\nat social lives. You won\u2019t get\nalong with everyone in the\nworld. There will always be\npeople who don\u2019t find your\njokes funny, who find you too\neccentric or boring, or who\njust plain don\u2019t like you. The\nsame is true in The Sims; no\nmatter how much you compliment nor how many stories\nyou tell, you\u2019re guaranteed to\nhave characters who will just\nkeep on insulting and fighting\nyou. The solution in this case\nis simple, put one in a pool\nand delete the ladder; now\nwait a few days until the grim\nreaper arrives. Sadly we can\u2019t\ndo this in real life (They\u2019d\nprobably figure how to climb\nout for starters), so instead\nwe must settle for exchanging\nunsentimental pleasantries\nand stunted small talk. I know\nwhich world I prefer.\nWooHoo was definitely\none of the reasons I got into\nthe game. Being a twelve\nyear old boy, my first dose of\ntestosterone had just hit the\nblood stream when Sims 2\nwas released. At this point, a\nnew topic clouded my mind,\nsex, or in simlish \u2018WooHoo\u2019,\nand The Sims was a good\nstarter point for my research.\nSadly in both worlds I came\nto the same conclusion;\nWooHoo was very hard to\nas your favourite municipal\nobjects are turned into prime\nWooHoo stations for some\nyoung amorous couples\nfuelled by Bacardi Breezer\u2019s.\nFrom playground swings to\ntransparent bus shelters (Both\nof which witnessed first hand),\nthe possibilities are endless.\nThis is less of a reason to play\nThe Sims and more of a thank\nyou to Maxis for keeping it\nclassy.\nAspirations.

When\nwas the last time you opened\nthe news paper, with a new\njob in your dream sector,\nonly to shut it half an hour\nlater because you have no\nexperience and won\u2019t even\nget an interview? We all\nknow that achieving your\ngoals in life can be a long\nand laborious task. Take,\nfor instance, the fact that\nthe biggest reason most\nof us are at university for\nthree years plus is so we\ncan get our foot in the door\nin a particular profession.\nJuxtapose this with the Sims\nand they haven\u2019t even heard\nof university (Unless you buy\nthe expansion pack but even\nthen it doesn\u2019t affect your\nworking life, it\u2019s just a way\nto up your WooHoo count -which is the second biggest\nreason people go to uni).\nThe Sims provides a way to\nsucceed in life with ease and\nin record timing.

It\u2019s a sandbox of reality\nwhere you can simulate\nendless stories and social\nsituations, without any sense\nof embarrassment or fear of\nfailure.

This sombre\npremise is transformed with\nall Kimmings\u2019 charm and\nidiosyncrasy into a musical,\nablaze with physical theatre,\nacerbic dialogue, and\nsongs such as Even Cunts\nget Cancer, Fuck This, and\nMRI RnB. The impressive\npart of this production is\nit manages to do all this\nwithout becoming crass\nor disrespectful. In fact,\nthroughout the pantomime a\nserious point is being raised:\ncancer is shit and those that\nsuffer shouldn\u2019t be expected\nto become paragons of\npositivity \u2013 they are as human\nas everyone else. The best\nthose of us who still live in \u2018the\nkingdom of the well\u2019 can do is\nto recognise this.\nThis production is successful\nprecisely because it makes\nthis humanity relevant. The\nfinal scene is intimate and\nbold, calling forth both actors\nand audience to share their\nexperiences with cancer.\nKimmings wrote the play,\nin part, because of her own\nexperience with a seriously\nill son; the characters are\nall based on real figures\nKimmings encountered in\nher experience in hospitals\nand with cancer patients. At\nits most emotive, the actors\nintersperse dialogue with real\nrecordings of the cancer sufferers they are representing.\nThe research is immaculate\nEzra Kitson\nand the performances deeply\nevocative.\nBut I don\u2019t love this piece,\nand I came out of the theatre\nfrustrated by a terrific idea\nexecuted sloppily. This is not\nto say the production isn\u2019t\ngood \u2013 far from it. The set\ndesign is eerie and atmos-pheric: a hospital ward with\nseven exits. The choreography is slick and the band\nflawlessly moves through an\neclectic range of styles. The\ncasting is well done, and\non stage the actors form\na motley crew of patients\nand doctors that is visually\npleasing, helped by superb\ncostume design throughout. I\nwas especially impressed by\nthe colourful tumour costumes\nthat are surprisingly beautiful\n(and, to my limited knowledge\nof cancer biology, surprisingly\naccurate).\nThe songs themselves are\nthe play\u2019s undoing: for the\nmost part they are tawdry\nand forgettable. This is\nparticularly true in the dull\nmelody of Fingers Crossed,\nwhich returns as a motif\nthroughout the play. Perhaps\nthis wouldn\u2019t be as much of\na problem if the singing was\ngood, but unfortunately some\nof the cast were continually\nsharp and their voices were\n\\\\ The songs\nthemselves are the\nplay\u2019s undoing: for\nthe most part they\nare tawdry and\nforgettable \\\\\nThe Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the\nWar on Cancer is on at the\nNational Theatre until 29\nNovember.\nMon \u2013 Sat 7\n.30pm. Matinees Sat.\nTickets \u00a315-45.\n\\\\ National Theatre\nA\ns I walked\ninto Somerset\nHouse from the\nincreasingly\nbitter streets\nsurrounding\nthe Strand, I was greeted\nby the world of fashion,\nalong with a flock of fashion\nstudents. I was at the brand\nnew exhibitIion, Hair by Sam\nMcKnight, designed to mimic\nboth the feel of a catwalk\nand an editorial photoshoot.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect\nfrom a collection solely\ncentred on hair \u2013 after all, it\nonly takes up a small part of\nour bodies, how influential\ncould it be? Well, if you want\nto find out just how much hair\nshaped the world, then this is\nthe exhibition for you.\nSam McKnight is one of\nthe most famous hair stylists\nof this generation, having\nstyled the glossy locks of Kate\nMoss, Princess Diana, Tilda\nSwinton, and Lady Gaga \u2013\nto name but a few. Having\nhelped style the iconic looks\nbehind Vivienne Westwood\u2019s\neclectic collections, as well\nas keeping things classy for\nChanel, McKnight has been\nin the forefront of the fashion\nscene since the 1970s, and\ncontinues to reign supreme.\nThe exhibition celebrates \u201c40\nyears of fashion\u2019s most iconic\nhairstyles\u201d, and it was only\nfrom seeing this that I realised\nhow versatile our keratin\nstrands really are: McKnight\nsees hair as a material that\ncan be harnessed, regrown,\nshaped, or coloured into\nalmost anything imaginable.\nHe\u2019s famous for the \u2018pouf\u2019 and\nthe \u2018done-undone\u2019 looks, and\nhe coined a technique that\ncan turn any hair type into\nan afro (I\u2019ll be trying it later).\nHis career speaks for itself,\nwith the walls of the exhibit\nlined with Vogue covers and\neditorial shoots he styled for,\nas well as personal polaroids\nof him with notoriously\nfamous fashion faces.\nThe exhibit itself has ups\nand downs, but overall does\na great job of showcasing\nthe work and life behind\nMcKnight himself. A highlight\nfor me was a room filled\nwith larger than life editorial pieces of models with\ncompletely different looks,\nall of which were stunningly\nunique and beautiful. Smaller\nrooms focused on certain\ndesigners or iconic people,\nmost notably Princess Diana,\nwho allowed McKnight to\nradically cut her hair, giving\nher the image she is remembered by today. Some parts\nof the exhibition fell a bit\nflat, with random wigs and\npieces of multi-coloured hair\ngiving little added meaning\nto what was going on, and\nsome rooms weren\u2019t very\ncaptivating \u2013 but I suppose\nit depends on your relative\ninterest in fashion. I did wish\nthere was a bit more on the\nactual process of hair styling,\nas well as documenting\nMcKnight\u2019s life in more detail;\na little bit of history regarding\ncertain hairstyles wouldn\u2019t\nhave gone amiss! But then\nagain, it\u2019s not the V&A, and\nSomerset House is known for\nkeeping things contemporary\nand fresh.\nOverall I think this exhibit is\nworth seeing, not only from a\nfashion perspective, but also\nfor the photography aspect.\nGoing through the exhibition,\nI learned that I can afford to\nmake far bolder choices when\nit comes to hairstyling. I think\nI\u2019ll leave the buzzcut for now\nthough...\n\\\\ McKnight sees\nhair as a material\nthat can be\nharnessed, regrown,\nshaped, or coloured\ninto almost anything\nimaginable \\\\\nLizzie Riach\nHair by Sam McKnight\nis on at Somerset House\nuntil 12 March 2017\n.\nWed 2 Oct 2016 \u2013 Sun 12 Mar 2017\nSat \u2013 Tues until 6pm; Wed \u2013 Fri until\n8pm\nTickets \u00a312.50 \\\\ Concessions \u00a310\nA world of hair \\\\ Somerset House\nHair by Sam\nMcKnight\nLooking down on Sam McKnight\u2019s inimitable creations \\\\ Somerset House\n\\\\ The final scene is\nintimate and bold,\ncalling forth both\nactors and audience\nto share their\nexperiences with\ncancer \\\\\nhalting and unassured. I considered leaving this criticism\nout \u2013 after all am I not missing\nthe point slightly? The actors\nare playing real people, and\ntheir voices are accordingly\nsincere and human. Perhaps,\nbut the arrangements were\nentirely wrong for this sort of\nsinging; they required trained\nand powerful voices, the\nkind that only actress Naana\nAgyei-Ampdau possessed.\nAnother issue is the narration Kimmings provides. I\nunderstand the need for a\nnarrator in this play, especially after the denouement\nwhere the fourth wall is\nentirely broken and no one\nseems to know how to con-tinue. Kimmings doesn\u2019t do a\nbad job either; the narration\npaces the play well and I\nliked the dialogue between\ncharacters and narrator.\nAt the same time, I have no\nempathy for Kimmings as she\nnarrates. She researched the\nplay, yes, and undoubtedly\nhas been affected by cancer\nas almost all of us have, but\nhers is the voice of a proud\nwriter and it does nothing to\nelicit an emotional response.\nIt would have been far more\npowerful if one of the cancer\npatients upon whom the\ncharacters are based had\nrecorded the voice over.\nFinally as the older critic\nsat next to me remarked, the\nplay is heavily focused on\nmillennials. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk\nenough talk about cancer\u201d\nthe narration begins. My\nneighbour scoffed \u2013 given\nhow many people she knew\nwith the disease I\u2019m sure this\nfelt entirely misplaced.\nA Pacifist\u2019s Guide to the\nWar on Cancer achieves\nwhat it sets out to do: it makes\ncancer human and it makes\nit intimate. It\u2019s just a shame\nthat the powerful aspects of\nthis piece clash against its\ntheatricality. Given a re-draft\nand a change to the song list,\nthis could easily be a five star\nperformance.\n\n"

During the\npresentation of the Deputy\nPresident\u2019s report by Emily\nJane Cramphorn, James\nbrought up the consent training\ncourse, suggesting that the\nfunds spent on the licensing\ncould have been spent better\nelsewhere. Cramphorn\ndefended the program by\nsaying that the funding, having\ncome directly from College\nand not the Union, meant that\nthe consent training would not\ndrain resources from Clubs\nand Societies.\nHowever this doesn\u2019t seem\nto have appeased James. In\na comment piece submitted to\nfelix, about the importance of\nCouncil for holding staff and\nsabs to account, he illustrates\nTeach\nFirst\nis\na\nregistered\ncharity,\nno.\n1098294\nDevelopyourskillsandhelpputanendtoeducationalinequality.\nteachfirst.org.uk/recruitment\nApplynowforourundergraduateandgraduateopportunities\nPrint ad for Imperial.indd 1 31/10/2016 15:45:42\nhis point with \u201ca particularly\nwasteful Union expenditure as\nan example\u201d, referring to the\nconsent training program.\nIn his comment piece,\nJames says that the concept\nof consent is sufficiently\nexplained through the\ninfamous \u2018Tea and Consent\u2019\nanimation which was released\nby the British Police in 2015. He\nwrites that \u201canyone who thinks\nthat potential rapists exist on\nutterly wasted\u201d.\nAdditionally, the RCSU\nGeneral Committee voted\nunanimously to condemn\nthe expenditure. The specific\nwording of the motion passed\nwas as follows. \u201cThe Royal\nCollege of Science Union\ncondemns the spending\nby College on the Consent\nMatters software which we\nbelieve to be a wasteful and\nineffectivemethodofinforming\nstudents on the important issue\nof consent.\u201d\nIn reply to James\u2019 piece,\nCramphorn (whose manifesto\npoints included delivering\nconsent workshops),\ncommented that \u201ccases such\nas Stanford, Columbia and\nothers across UK universities\nhave highlighted that the\nsector is not equipped to\nsupport students who are\nvictims of sexual violence.\nUnfortunately the UK's Sex &\nRelationship Education (SRE)\ndoes not encompass consent,\nand this means that there\nare many young people who\nmay not understand what\nbehaviour is acceptable and\nwhat behaviour isn't and what\nmakes a healthy approach to\nrelationships.\u201d\nCramphorn indeed has a\npoint. A recent government\nrequested report published\nearlier this October by\nUniversities UK shows that\nsexual harassment on campus\nis a major issue, which the\neducation sector is not\nsufficiently tackling.\nSpokesperson for The 1752\nGroup Dr Anna Bull said\nthat \u201cdespite the increasing\npressure on universities to\ncurb a rise in on-campus\nassaults and improve their\nsafeguarding policies, young\nwomen are nevertheless\noften terrified about the\nconsequences if they make a\ncomplaint, particularly about\na staff member. So often when\nthey do, the university\u2019s chief\nconcern is to downplay any\nwrongdoing and protect its\nown reputation by keeping the\nwhole thing quiet.\nMore needs to be done\nto protect women at British\nuniversities. They need to be\nencouraged to report assault\nand harassment. In the US,\nuniversities are obligated to\ninvestigate any such claims\nunder federal law, regardless\nof any criminal investigation.\u201d\nCramphorn adds that \u201cas an\ninstitution and as a Students'\nUnion we have a duty of care\ntowards our students, to both\ncreate a healthy, respectful\ncommunity, and to ensure that\nwe are able to support students\nwho have experienced sexual\nviolence. Currently the idea\nof Consent Training is still\nin review and evaluation\nprocesses and hasn't yet been\nrolled out to the student body,\nbut it is one of the steps we\nand the college are taking\nto produce an institutional\nresponse towards tackling\nsexual violence on campus\u201d\nSince the start of the\nacademic year, there have\nbeen two sexual harassment\ntestimonials published in felix\nby female students, who chose\nto remain anonymous.\nCramphorn took a stand last week\nagainst sexism and misogyny \\\\\nJoe O\u2019Connel -Danes for felix\n\\\\ Since the start of\nthe academic year,\nthere have been two\nsexual harassment\ntestimonials\npublished in felix \\\\\ncampus simply because they\nwere never presented with\na cartoon telling them that\n\u2018you shouldn\u2019t have sex with\nunconscious people\u2019 is utterly\ndelusional.\u201d He concludes that\n\u201cthis purchase will contribute\nnothing to the student\nexperience on campus,\u201d and\nreferstothefundsthatwentinto\nthe consent training program\nas \u201c\u00a35,000 completely and\n\n"

I\u2019m the\nnew Sport editor, I\nlove playing sports,\nI love writing\nabout sports, and right now\nI\u2019m writing about one sport\nmost of you probably haven\u2019t\nheard of (including myself\nuntil a week ago). Apologies\nin advance for those\nexpecting a heroic sports\nstory, I\u2019m more likely to star in\nThe Benchwarmers than The\nMighty Ducks.\nKabaddi is what I might\ncall a fusion sport. It brings\nback memories of playground games of tag whilst\nmaintaining the gentlemanly\nmanner of rugby. Two teams\nof seven face off across a\nhave a host of achievements\nincluding success in national\ntournaments, the first ever\nestablished Women\u2019s Kabaddi\nteam, and being awarded\n\u2018Sports Club of the Year\u2019 in\n2015/16 by Sport Imperial.\nThe drills were efficient and\ninformative. Everyone learns\nthe basics and confidence\ngrows as a result. We move\ninto some games: teams\npicked with experienced\nplayers as captains. I watch\nas the first two teams face\noff, beginners given constant\nencouragement to get\ninvolved. Now my turn. I take\nthe hand of the teammate\nI\u2019m coupled with (part of the\ngame I promise) and watch\nas an opponent makes their\nway across to us. Various\nshuffled movements lead to a\nsnatched touch, an escapee\nbrought to the ground and\nan overweight reporter\ncrossing the halfway line in\nan attempt to help. I\u2019m told\nthis is a foul, but I\u2019m given\nthe benefit of the doubt. I\u2019m\ngiven a chance to raid with\nlittle result, but I\u2019m starting\nto like this unusual foray of\nwhat could be misconstrued\nas violent form of kiss chase,\nif they were to introduce\nmixed teams. The flow of the\ndefence as it moves round\na raider, the sudden dash\nMen\u2019s2nd\nXVreach18-winstreak\nAnthony Featherstone\nT\nhe 2s continued\ntheir perfect streak\nwith yet another\nwin, this time at\nFortress Harlington\nagainst Canterbury\nChrist Church. With the 1s\non a rest week, the team\nhad a big, loud crowd to\nback them up, and did not\ndisappoint. The Imperial\npack was unstoppable,\nwinning every scrum,\nmaking it easy work for\npower centre Giustinuainaiai\n(spelling confirmation\npending) to smash through\nthe try line, topping it all off\nwith a celebratory \u201cdab\u201d.\nAfter the stalemate was\nbroken, Imperial cruised\non through to an easy win,\nwith a very cheeky hattrick from fake fresher (but\nreal lobster) Tuleu, two\nwonderful break-away tries\nby Rob \u2018I didn\u2019t think he was\nthat fast\u2019 Lawrence, and\na good solo effort off the\nscrum by fresher Dowkes.\nApparently the man of the\nmatch, Will \u2018He\u2019s an alright\ncaptain\u2019 Bolton also scored\na try, but got a knock on the\nhead so I wouldn\u2019t take his\nword for it. Canterbury did\nscore a try, but my memory\nis pretty hazy on the details.\nEnd score 55-5.\nspace roughly the size of\nhalf a tennis court, with the\nend goal of tagging as many\nof the opposing team as\npossible during solo raids\nwithout getting wrestled to the\nground. Points are scored for\nsuccessful tags as well as a\nsturdy defence. Sounds simple\nenough, right?\nIt\u2019s a Wednesday afternoon\nand I find myself doing laps\nin a small exercise room,\nfollowed by a Sun Salutation\nyoga stretch taken directly\nfrom Kabaddi\u2019s Indian origins.\nWe were taken straight into\nsome drills where the breadth\nof knowledge and experience\nof the guys taking the session\nwas immediately evident. Did\nI mention they represent their\nNational team? These guys\nas a tag is attempted, it all\nculminates into an enthralling\nexperience.\nYou won\u2019t see my\nname on the back of an\nEngland Kabaddi team shirt\nanytime soon, but I can say\nthat I thoroughly enjoyed\nthis new adventure. It\u2019s an\namazing workout, a perfect\ncombination of camaraderie and sportsmanship and\nan honour to have a club\nwith such prestige at our\nUniversity. I urge you to give\nit a go and contact the club\nvia the union site as soon as\nyou\u2019ve read the rest of the\nsports section.\nWant to see some in action?\nGo along to the Kabaddi Cup\nhosted right here at Imperial\non the 5th\nof November in the\nGreat Hall \u2013 an unforgettable\nexperience!\n\\\\ A snatched\ntouch, an\nescapee brought to\nthe ground and an\noverweight report\ncrossing the halfway line \\\\\n\n"

Blah.Blah.Blah\nfelixonline.co. uk /comment fcomment@ic.ac.uk\nH\naving watched\nenough music\nvideos and\nviewed the\nodd \u2018Rich Kids\nof Instagram\u2019\nprofile, it\u2019s not unusual to\nspot an exotic animal being\nused as a power status\nsymbol or display of wealth\nfor social media. A tiger\npadding over a marble floor,\na marmoset monkey hanging\nfrom a chandelier, or a snake\nbeing used as a prop in a\npainstakingly well-lit selfie. All\nthe types of image that would\nattract plenty of attention.\nAll vanity posts. The animal\nhaving one purpose: to add to\nthe backdrop of money.\nWhile I\u2019m sure the vast\nmajority of exotic animal\nowners do genuinely care\nfor these animals as beloved\npets, the new wave of exotic\npet ownership as a glorified\nfashion statement is a trend\non the rise. And with it has\ncome a worrying increase in\ncases of exotic animals being\nneglected when owners are\ninsufficiently equipped to\nprovide for the animals\u2019 needs.\nThis issue starts with the\nease of purchase. I had a\nquick look online. It turns out\nthat on Gumtree I could have\nbought a bearded dragon for\na mere \u00a3100, or perhaps two\npythons for \u00a340. Mercifully\nthere were no tigers, panthers\nor lions for sale on Gumtree,\nbut obviously these would\ncome with a significantly\nheftier price tag. Yet, animal\nwelfare organisations have\nreported there to be around\n25,000 online advertisements\nfor the sale of exotic animals\non sites like buytigers.com. In\nEngland a licence is required\nbefore such ownership (under\nthe \u2018Dangerous Wild Animals\nAct\u2019, 1976), but once you\u2019ve\nacquired that and enough\ncash in the bank, you\u2019re free\nto buy an enormous wild\npredator.\nOncetheanimalispurchased\nand has raked in a couple of\nhundred likes on an Instagram\npost, there\u2019s the small bother\nof looking after it. Certainly\nmore precautions should be\ntaken and questions asked\nbefore buying a panther as\nopposed to your bog standard\ndomestic cat. What does it eat?\nHow much space is required?\nWill it mistake my granny for\na tasty vole rat while we\u2019re\ntrying to enjoy a family\nSunday roast? Sadly, when\nthese kind of responsibilities\nand questions aren\u2019t properly\nthought through, issues\nbecome apparent.\nAccording to the Humane\nSociety, only 10% of the\n15,000 tigers in the US live in\nprofessionally regulated zoos\nand sanctuaries, meaning\na large proportion of the\nother 90% are confined to\nsomeone\u2019s house or garden.\nFor a naturally wide-ranging\nanimal, living in someone\u2019s\nhome is a form of neglect\nin itself, having detrimental\neffects on health by causing\njoint, muscle or circulatory\nproblems. Stating the obvious\nhere, tigers are also far more\nlikely to be involved in a fatal\nattack on humans than other\ndomestic pets. In fact they are\n360 to 720 times more likely\nthan dogs. And the story is\nvery much a similar one for\nother big cats and predators.\nThen there\u2019s the small fluffy\nanimals,thosewhichfillthegap\nin the market a Pomeraniancross-Pug-cross-Poodle never\ncould. Take the slo loris \u2013 a\nbig-eyed, bushy-tailed ball\nof cuteness (you\u2019ve probably\nseen one of these in a video\nhaving its armpits tickled).\nNocturnal animals with large\neyes are specially adapted\nfor seeing in darkness. In\ncaptivity, though, they have\nto adapt to the sleeping times\nof their non- nocturnal owners\nwho want to spend time with\nthe lovable slo loris during the\nday. Being kept in rooms with\nbright artificial lighting and\nspending an unnatural amount\nof time awake in the daylight\nhours is uncomfortable and\neven painful for the slo loris\u2019\neyes. People buying them also\nstruggle to meet the varied\ndietary requirements of these\nrainforest animals. They would\nusually munch on a range of\nfruits and insects from the\nrainforest ecosystem \u2013 difficult\nto find in the suburbs.\nClearly, exotic animals are\nhigh maintenance, and too\noften caring for them properly\nbecomes more hassle than\nthe good photos and social\nmedia attention are worth.\nThe realisation dawns on the\nowner that they\u2019re not going\nto find a lion-sized litter tray\nat the nearest Pets at Home,\nnor can an orangutan survive\noff scraps of leftover pizza.\nAnd while a chihuahua may\noccasionally growl when\napproached too close to its\nfood, one flash of pearly white\nfrom a tiger would leave you\na shivering wreck in your own\nhome.\nThere\u2019s a reason why we\ngenerally stick to owning dogs,\ncats, hamsters and so on. It\u2019s\nbecause they have undergone\ngenerations of domestication\nand become suited to living\nwith us. Exotic pets, on the\nother hand, are ripped out\nof their natural habitat and\npropelled into domestic life.\nEven if they have been bred\nin captivity, their species still\nhasn\u2019t had the history of living\nwith humans needed to adapt\nto our lifestyle.\nIt therefore seems entirely\nunnatural for anyone to\nprivately own one of these\nanimals, especially if the main\nintention is for the animal\nto be part of the d\u00e9cor in\na narcissistic social media\nfacade.
