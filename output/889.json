    "content": "Adam Harrington presents his opinion on the current crisis:\nIs War A Solution?\nThroughout the past months the media\nand the politicians have been talking\nblithely about war as though it were no\nmore unusual than buying half a dozen\neggs.\n'Of course we don't want war', they\nsay, 'but principles must be upheld'.\nAnybody who can even consider war as a viable option has a seriously bad attitude\ntowards human life.\n1 don't want to discuss the issues\ninvolved in the present game of toy\nsoldiers because in twenty years time\nthey will all be forgotten. All that will be\nremembered is that hundreds of\nthousands died, if it remains a local war,\nor millions if it doesn't. Why do I think\nthis? Because out of the hundreds of wars\nthat have been fought, who, apart from\nhistorians, can say why they were fought?\nThe reasons must have seemed fairly\ncompelling at the time. There is only one\nwar that a fair number of people know\nthe cause of and that is the last major\none, 1939-1945. What is better known about that one is that it killed about 40\nmillion people, bankrupted a continent\nand resulted in half of that continent\nbeing kept under a grossly unpleasant\npolitical system for the best part of fifty\nyears.\nWho knows the reason for the Vietnam\nand Korean wars? Who the Yom Kippur\nand Six day wars, the Spanish Civil war,\nthe First World War, the Crimean, the\nBoer and the American Civil war? It goes\non and on. The reasons my be different,\nbut the result is the same. Somebody\nsomewhere thinks that people are more\nuseful as bags of fertilizer. I happen to\nthink I am more useful alive, and I think\neverybody else is too.\nAn extraordinary veil comes over the\neyes of many people when massive pain\nand misery occur. This veil has an\nobvious purpose\u2014to protect the\nindividual's sanity from what the\nindividual cannot cope with. But this veil\nwill probably be the undoing of this\ncivilisation, if not of this species. In any\nother situation, if I was to promote the\nidea that thousands of individuals should\nbe destroyed, I would rightly be\nconsidered to be mad. Yet because 'the\nState' says it's for some nebulous 'ideal'\nit's fine, and anyone who says otherwise\nis a danger to 'the State' and its people.\n1 dare say that there is a number of\npeople who disapprove of my views.\nWell, to be quite honest I don't care\u2014I'm not going to re mould my conscience\nbecause of what they say. They have the\nright to their own views but they have no\nright to actively promote the killing of\nthousands. They are playing right into the\nhands of the politicians. The two most\ncommon arguments against anti-war\nviews are that 'if everybody was like you\nthen we would be overrun by a state we\ndidn't like' or something similar. 1 would\n;i> ay that if everybody had my views on\nthe subject, nobody would overrun\nanybody\u2014life is too short to play games\nlike that. That is a pie-in-t he-sky ideal, I know, but so is defending any ideal, like\ndemocracy or the American dream, for\ninstance.\nAnother argument would be cowardice.\nAnybody who volunteers to be killed\nwhen somebody tells them to is not, in\nmy opinion, brave but rather dim-witted.\n1 don't deny that I have a healthy sense\nof self preservation\u2014anyone who didn't would have died a long time ago. Trying\nto stay alive is a fairly natural trend, and\nanyone who claims otherwise is talking\nrubbish. 1 am certainly not frightened to\nput my views forward, and the only\nreason I am taking the liberty of doing it\nnow is because 1 feel it's the only method\nopen to me to try to put a halt to the\napproaching obscenity.\nIt depends on your definition of the\nword, but I would not consider the views\nset out here to be a study of pacifism.\n\"Certainly, all forms of violence against\nfellow humans are to be discouraged nothing unconventional there\u2014but\nviolence in personal self-defence or\ndefence of those close to you is bound to\nhappen, and I wouldn't like to say that I'd never do it. The mere difference in scale\nbetween attacking somebody about to\nrape your sister and a full scale war and\nthe fact 1 accept one and not the other\nmay be considered odd. Bear in mind\nthat attacking a rapist will not destroy the\nhuman race and that the rapist or the\nattacker has the opportunity of running\naway when they have had enough\u2014so\nthere is a safety valve. If you are part of\nan army then your own conscience has to\nbe subjugated to the orders of your\nsuperiors. You cannot run away, the fight\nwill continue with no safety valve until\nthere aren't enough people left to\ncontinue it.\nMy basic argument against this and any\nother war is the simplest one; it kills lots\nof people. If things start getting very\nserious everyone will have to examine\ntheir consciences\u2014is it really worth killing\nor dying for? Many people have many\ndifferent answers\u2014mine is 'no', and Iam not going to be associated with this most\nridiculous and disgusting trait of human\nbehaviour. I sincerely hope that there are\nenough civilised people in the country\nwho have a similar point of view to make\nthose who start war think twice about its\neffects.\n\n"

The gentleman, about 5' 10\" and\naged between 25 and 30, was asked for\nhis Union card but he replied 'I'm not a student here.' He was then escorted into\nthe quad with assistance of other Union\nmembers.\nAt this point the man became violent.\nWitnesses at the scene said '...he went\nmad!' and 'He was totally fucking loopy!'.\nHe began flailing his arms wildly and\nscreaming and appeared to be either\nexcessively drunk or under the influence\nof drugs. He refused to be calmed down\nand so was carried out of the quad.\nReentering the Union, he assaulted\nthree Union members who did not\nretaliate. The injuries received included\none black eye, two split lips and a broken\ntooth. As a result of these assaults the\nPolice were called who promptly\nremoved the man. He has been charged\nwith grievous bodily harm.\nCollege Break-ins\nTwo break-ins occured during the past\nweek. On Sunday, two storage rooms\nwere forced open below Linstead but\nnothing was taken.

These were launched from mobile\nlaunchers, despite the UN forces attempt to destroy all of\nthe SCUD launchers with air attacks.\nAir-raid sirens were sounded in Jerusalem, and there\nare three confirmed hits on Tel Aviv. The other missiles\nhave hit population centres to the south of Tel Aviv. A CNS reporter in Tel Aviv reported at least seven or eight\nexplosions within the city.\nAt 1.30 am it was confirmed that at least one of the\nmissiles delivered a chemical warhead containing nerve\ngas. Israeli authorities have issued instructions to their\npeople to don gas masks and stay inside sealed rooms.\nIsraeli hospitals have already taken in casualties from\nnerve gas. Soon after the Pentagon denied this.\nIsrael was apparently well prepared. Gas masks and\nshelters have been distributed, and the populace have\nbeen instructed in the procedures for their use.\nAn Israeli spokesman at the Pentagon felt that the\nreaction of Israeli people would be to launch '...an attack\nvery soon, possibly within the next few hours'. He also\nstated that it is likely the attack would be '...massive...'\nAnother spokesman speaking from Israel said 'This could\nsignal the end of President Hussein within 24 hours'.\nAmerican statements indicate that they expect a response\nto occur. Whether or not this has already happened was\nnot said. Concern was expressed as to the magnitude of\nthe response, and whether it would be '...justifiable...'.\n\n"

To justify this view\nhe recited a list of other places we\nallegedly failed to help, such as\nAfghanistan, Panama, Czechoslovakia,\nSouth Africa (?) and others. Well, I suggested, wouldn't this be a perfect\nopportunity to start helping oppressed\npeople around the world?

You then\nwander down to some bar. You have few\npints with the lads, brag about what\nhappened last night, and then, unlike\nmost of the 'men' here, go and chat up\nsome dopey bitch.

The\nwoman thinks you're responsible, 'cos\nyou're wearing the thing. You think\nyou're safe. Guy's, you with me so far?\nSo you bon k her more stupid than she\nis already is. You're just thinking about\nleaving now you've sobered up enough to\nsee her face clearly. You look down. Shit,\nthe balloons up, the rubbers ripped. It's not you're fault that you're a real man, is\nit?\nI ask you, what are British Standards\ncoming to? The pride of the British\nworkforce has gone to pot! It's bad\nenough that you've got to wear a raincoat on your knob, just 'cos the pill is\nout of fashion with todays 'liberated', ie\neasy, women. Some toss ers might write\nletters to you saying how wonderful\nBritain is, but what state are we in when\na man can't even be free to use his God\ngiven right to sex when he wants it,\nwithout worrying about catching\nsomething? Not to mention the hassle of\nsome bitch knocking on your door in\nthree months time. It wouldn't be so bad,\nbut they never take T**k off for an\nanswer!\nYours,\nA Real Man,\nDear Sir,\nI have a number of points to make this\nweek.\n1. My first point is that I shall try to\nnumber them all so that when people like\nAmin El-Kholy talk about my letters they\ncan give an Issue number and a point\nnumber when discussing my assertions.\n2. Mr El-Kholy says his 'first reaction,\nhowever, was not to waste time on a reply since the arguments presented were\nso weak...' Surely if they were so weak\nthey would not take long to brush away?\nI'm afraid that that sort of reply is always\nlooked upon as a last desperate bluff,\nwhether rightly or wrongly.\nHowever, I shall try and work out\nwhich points he was on about. If he was\ndiscussing the letter in issue 883 (the only\nletter since his first effort) then here is\nmy reply:\nThe first 43 words discuss the necessity\nfor exact use of vocabulary in an\nargument eg 'no proven correlation' and\n'proven no correlation' are two totally\ndifferent statements made up of the same\nthree words. I will expect no argument\non this part.\nThe next 70 words deals with the FACT that hostages must not be used for\nbargaining. If I hold a gun to my bank\nmanager's head and ask for a million\npounds and I am not punished, then I and\neveryone else will try it again. You will\nget a million pounds, you will not actually\nhave to hurt anyone, and it will soon\nbecome daily routine.\nThen comes 98 words on the same\nlines as the Amnesty International article\nin issue 888. No arguments here I hope.\nThe rest is the choice of Athena as a name which could result in endless\nirrelevant discussion as I'm not changing\nit.\n3. About sanctions. While I would\nprefer sanctions t Q war, it is clear that\nSaddam does, not worry about his people,\nindeed he has used Chemicals on them.\nSo he will not notice sanctions until it\nbegins to hurt his Military. This will take\nseveral years. He is also close to\ndeveloping nuclear weapons, which he\nwill use as he used Chemicals. So there is\ngood reason to believe that sanctions will\nfail.\nThus it is vital that Saddam believes\nthat he will eventually be attacked if he\ndoes not withdraw, otherwise he won't withdraw.\nThe UN has set a date, by which he\nmust be withdrawing from Kuwait. He\nhas already had since August 2. He has\nhad enough time. If on that day the UN agrees to allow more time, it says to him\n'ok, but if you don't get out on xxx you'll\ndie. Ok, if you don't get out on yy y you'll\ndie..' etc. It would be reminiscent of the\nRobin Williams sketch on Khaddaffi's Line\nof Death: 'You cross this line, you die.\nOk, you cross this line you die. This line.\nThis. Ok, you knock on my door, I'm not\ncoming out, ny ar.'I might be able to understand the\nthinking that 15 January is too early;\nthough I might not agree with it, I could\nsee the idea came from a relatively sane\nmind. However the date has been set. It\ncannot now be changed without\nconvincing Saddam he can stay as long as\nhe wants.\n4. I hope that after reading my article\nin 885 I clarified my dislike of any\norganised religion. The point should now\nbe clear that the Islamic countries now\nhave the same degree of religious belief\nas did Europe approximately four\ncenturies ago. They have a culture based\nheavily on their religion, and the\ntheocracy has a similar power to the\nCatholic church of European history. It is\nfor this reason that I state that the Islamic\nnations are four centuries less culturally\nmature than the West. It is not meant as\na slur of intelligence. The fact is that it\ntakes a long time for a population to\ncome to terms with the fact that the\ntheocracy distorts a religion for its own\npurposes. It is the same for communism,\nIslam, the Roman Catholics; the people at\nthe top are corrupt. For example:\nSaddam has called for a Holy war. Sura\n109 of the Koran finishes by saying about\nunbelievers 'To you your religion, and to\nme mine'. And in Sura 2 'God loves not\nthe aggressors. Slay them wherever you\ncome upon them.' And yet it was Saddam\nwho invaded Kuwait. The UN should\nperhaps follow the Koran and slay\nSaddam?\n5. Here's one, primarily for Christians,\nbut also for any 'eternal life' religion. God\nsays to forgive a man his sins, the one\nlost sheep being the most important etc.\nTo get to Heaven you must be\ncompassionate and not tolerate a man\nsuffering, even if he is your enemy. So\nhow can there be anyone in Heaven? To\nbe in Heaven, and know that uncountable\nsouls are suffering for eternity in Hell,\nmust cause you incredible anguish.\nHeaven will be your own private Hell!\nand if you are content to see people\nsuffer in Hell, then you do not deserve to\nbe in Heaven! I can't wait to hear your\narguments on that one!\n6. Ok Pro-Life time. First let's talk about\nthe six GUYS that wrote this letter (issue\n885, Da Capo), they're GUYS! God-squad\nfor that matter. No doubt you believe a22 continued..\n\n"

    "content": "Sf\nFELIX\nDuring the countdown to potential chemical warfare in the Gulf, Christopher Riley remembers the consequences of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapon atrocities on the Kurdish people two years ago and examines a seventy year problem, sadly neglected by the United\nNations' Human Rights' Commission.\nThe People That Time Forgot\nFELIX\nIraq has been using chemical weapons on its own citizens since 1989, when over\nsixty villages were gassed. On March 17,\n1988, about 6,000 died when the town of\nHalabja was gassed. At about 6.00amon August 25, 1988, Iraqi war planes\ndropped chemical weapons over seventy\nKurdish villages in north east Iraq. In the\nBassay valley, alone, 200 families\nperished. Survivors described what it was\nlike: 'the planes dropped bombs, they did\nnot produce a big noise. A yellowish\ncloud was created and there was the\nsmell of rotten parsley or onions. There\nwere no wounds, people would breath\nthe smoke, then fall down and blood\nwould come from their mouths.' In\nAikmala, eight year old A a giza saw\nbombs land. A few moments later she\nwatched both her parents and brother\nfall, their skins blackened, they were\ndead. Aagiza escaped across the border\nto Turkey. She coughed, v omitted, and\nhad blood in her diarrhoea. Her skin\nstung from blisters, which took months to\nheal. Today she is one of the 30,000 Iraqi\nKurdish refugees living rough in the\nextreme climate of Eastern Turkey.\nIn the round-ups which followed, 3,000\nvillages were razed to the ground.\nLivestock was killed and 500,000 people\nwere removed from their homes. Many of\nthe men were killed and much of\nKurdistan has been made a 'free-fire'\nzone, where all humans or livestock are\nshot on sight.\nSince the invasion of Kuwait, sanctions\non Iraq have sterilised the economy of\nroadside shops on the Turkish border.\nWith the UN deadline fast approaching\nlast week, the Turkish Kurds around the\nSilopi Valley in south-eastern Turkey\nwere preparing for the worst. In such an erratic region, lacking sanctuary and\nwhere lightening always strikes twice,\nbuses out of the regional capital\nDiyarbakir were fully booked up and\npharmacists had sold out of the antidote\nto mustard gas.\nThe governments of Turkey, Iraq and\nIran are understandably concerned about\nthe Political ambitions of the Kurds but it\ncan be seen that the repression practised\nat the moment is only generating urban\nterrorism and doing nothing to solve the\nproblems.\nFrom the 16th Century the Ottoman\nand Persian Empires allowed the Kurdish\ntribes almost total autonomy in return for\nkeeping the peace on their remote open\nborders. The Kurdish people, who are\nIndo-European, have their own Persian\nbased language and culture. Although\nthere is no reliable estimate of their\nnumbers, there are believed to be\nbetween 20 and 25 million. At the end of\nWorld War I, the Ottoman empire was\ncarved up and the Kurds found\nthemselves homeless and scattered over\nTurkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria and the USSR.\nIn Iran five million Kurds have been\nsuppressed since the 1920s: their\nlanguage, in spoken or written form, and\ntheir culture, banned. In 1946 the Kurds\nof Mahabad succeeded in declaring an independent republic, but it only lasted a few months before authorities hanged the\nringleaders. Since the Islamic revolution\nTehran has refused all requests for\nKurdish autonomy.\nIn Iraq there were numerous revolts.\nDuring the late 1980s chemical weapons\nwere used on a holocaust scale not seen\nsince WorldWar I. Within a week, tens of\nthousands of Iraqi Kurds, many bearing\nfresh wounds from chemical weapons\nwere arriving in Turkey. This was hardly\nthe place to seek sanctuary. Turkey had\nturned a blind eye to the Iraqi attacks of\nthe 1980s, allowing rape of border\nvillages by Iraqi troops.\nIn Turkey almost ten million Kurds are\nforbidden to use their own language\ndespite the fact that many Kurds can only\nspeak their Kurdish mother language.\nEven the word 'Kurd' is banned. They are\nofficially known as 'Mountain Turks'. In\nthe 1920s and 1930s the Kurds rebelled\nagainst this discrimination. In response\nthe Turkish authorities suppressed them,\nwith great force, deporting up to one\nmillion people westwards from their\nhomeland.\nWhen the Kurdish member of Turkey's parliament publicly stated 'In Turkey\nthere are Kurds. I too ama Kurd', he was\nfound guilty of 'propaganda aimed at\nweakening national feelings' and\ncondemned to two years imprisonment\nwith hard labour. This Turkish apartheid\nhas been in force for sixty years now and\nhas resulted in the rise of a Marxist\nguerrilla group, the Kurdish Workers'\nParty (PKK) fighting for independence. In\ndesperation they have had to resort to\nviolence: attacking government forces\nand those who cooperate with them.\nDuring my travels around Turkish\nKurdistan, in 1989, I found a lot of\nresentment for the Turks, whose silent\ncooperation with Iraq and Iran seems to\nbe dedicated towards the total\nannihilation of their 'parasitic' minority\npeople. But the Kurds are a proud race\nand refuse to see the death of their\nlanguage and culture. In the ancient lakeside town of Van, I found Kurds singing\nKurdish freedom songs in the basement\nof their kili m shop.\n'When the snow comes to the high\nMountain,\nWhen the nightingale is sad,\nI can feel freedom and see freedom,\nBut cannot catch it\u2014I can only drink\nwater\nThat comes from the mountain,\nAnd then I think I touch freedom.\nWhen I see the Snowy Mountain,\nand when I think of you my lover\nMy soul starts to dance in my body.\nI am afraid my lover, I will not see you\nthe again,\nMy eyes are filled with tears,\nFor there are two things in life of which I am afraid.\nParting and death.'\n(continued overleaf)\n12 13\n\n"

For starters we had\nspaghetti bolognese up in the Peak\nDistrict. The weather was good, as\nalways, except for the cloud and rain\nwhich lasted all weekend. A good laugh\nwas had as we convinced fresher s that\nthrowing yourself off rock faces in the\nfreezing cold is THE thing to do. During\ndinner Phil 'I know how to prus so k' Wickens found himself stuck, and had to\neat suspended (rather painfully) from the\nceiling. A search for sanity led us to the\nlocal pub and then the silly games\nbegan...\nThe next weekend we .all piled into the\nback of a minibus with our gear and\nheaded up to the Midlands. Okay, so\nthere are no mountains in the Midlands,\nbut there are canals. Equipped with two\nbarges we managed to wreak havoc on\nthe British waterways through non-stop\nwater fights, bridge hopping and extremely\nbad driving.\nAfter a couple of weeks drying out we\npacked our bags once more and headed\noff to South Wales this time. Destination\nthe Black Mountains staying in a village\nhall for the weekend. Most people went\noff walking in extremely strong winds,\nalthough the hard-core rock climbers\nmanaged to make it to the local cafe. The\nhighlight of the weekend was a visit to\nAbergavenny's trendiest pub packed with\nSharons, Tracys, and Kev the Lads.\nThanks go to Nick and Jim for nearly\ngetting us kicked out.\nBy the end of term most people were\nworn out, and so only fourteen of us set\noff to Yorkshire. This turned out to be\nthe laziest and most luxurious weekend\never. The hut had thirty beds, showers,\nbaths, a TV, a pool table and a microwave oven.

    "content": "FELIX\nAnna Teeman discusses one of the major factors in Arab culture,\nand its part in the current crisis:\nThe Importance of Face\nAs you read this the infamous midnight\ndeadline will have passed. At5 am our\ntime on Wednesday 16th of January 1990\nyoung men and women might have\nalready lost their lives in an unjustifiable\nand worse an avoidable war.\nHow did our 'mature' international or\nrather American leaders bring the Middle\nEast to a war footing. American foreign\npolicy in its arrogance and ignorance has\nsteam-roller ed intelligent diplomacy in\nfavour of juvenile war mongering.\nAmerican and Arab rhetoric was\nmatched in its hateful content but it\nmeant different things to the two sides\nfrom which it came. The Americans\nheard their own rhetoric and to them\ncasual war mongering became a firm\ncommitment to conflict. Underlying Arab rhetoric was an Arab obsession with not\nlosing face. An example: An Englishman\nwas staying in a hotel in Cairo as he\npulled back his bed covers he found a bed infested with bugs. He went\ndownstairs and collared the manager.\n'There's bugs in my bed' the man said,\n'Impossible, there must be some mistake.\nI suggest an arm wrestle.' The\nEnglishman in his naivety battled hard on\nthe first wrestle. Then seeing the Arab's face he saw his quickest way to get new\nsheets. The Arab won the second and\nthird arm wrestles. As if by magic new\nsheets, crisp and clean, waited in his\nroom upstairs. The moral of this story is,\nin Arab culture it is vital never to lose\nface.\nThe French are highly adept in Middle\nEastern diplomacy. They don't judge the\nArabs but they work with their culture.\nThe French have learnt that although an\nArab will not lose face, infact because an\nArab will not lose face, they are masters\nof fine and subtle negotiation. It can be\nsaid that in our Western culture we too\ndo not want to lose face, but rather than\nnegotiation we arrive at confrontation.\nThe French peace package has two\nconditions. First an Iraqi promise of\nwithdrawal from Kuwait and second an\ninternational conference on the so-called\n'Palestinian problem'. Why is the rest of\nthe Western Alliance so resolute in it's near hysterical rejection of this life saving\ncompromise? Public opinion in Israel itself\nis constantly pushing for a peaceful end\nto the blood-letting on the Gazza Strip\nand the West Bank.\nWhat will be Israel's role in the near\ncertain conflict? Israel has an 'offensive'\ndefence policy. Under threat of attack\nIsrael will cripple her offender. In all her\nwars, on the strength of this policy, Israel\nhas won and the confrontations have\nbeen short. But how short would a conflict with Saddam Hussein's Iraq be?\nIsrael is the wild card in the pack. Her\nparticipation in any conflict transforms\nalliances now standing. Egyptian policy is\nclear. Egypt will fight alongside the\nWestern Allies against Saddam Hussein\nbut, once Iraq is in conflict with Israel,\nEgypt would then ally with Iraq. The\nMiddle East conflict would then become a bloody and bigoted 'jihad' or so-called\nholy war. Never has there been such a contradiction in terms.\nEvery war must come to an end and at\nevery end there is a peace conference at\nwhich all sides must compromise. Even\nafter the horrors of the Second World War the compromises at its end laid the\nfoundations for our mature and stable\nEurope. The Americans are willing to\nsacrifice infinitely precious human lives so\nthat they will sit around the table of\ncompromise later rather than sooner.\nWho is the madder of the men, Saddam\nor George?\n\n"

    "content": "The Fool W It is sad how infrequently a British\nI^B film comes before us, and equally\nsad how few of them actually\nsucceed. Most recently one thinks of A Fish Called Wanda and, in a limited way,\nNuns on the Run. Apart from those, only\nthe grand period pieces of the early\neighties spring to mind\u2014A Passage to\nIndia, Chariots of Fire and Little Dorrit.\nThis new film comes from the same\nstable as the last and is also set in\nDickensian London, although it is an\noriginal piece.\nIt tells of a clerk called Mr Frederick\n(Derek / Claudius Jacobi) who lives a bizarre double life. Much of the time he is\nthe accountant for a small London\nTheatre, yet he hob-no bs with the very\nelite of Victorian Society having adopted\nthe role of the reclusive Sir John who\nowns the Theatre, but never ventures\nout. We are presented with a morality\ntale of money and social injustice that has\nobvious parallels with the state of the\nCity and other money markets today.\nThe Rookie\nF This is a deceiving film. It sounds\nlike a good idea. It has sexy\nposters. It's got Clint Eastwood\n(always good for laugh) in it.\nUnfortunately it's not very good. The film\nfollows strictly formula plot lines that\nyou've seen far too many times, the\ndialogue is jerky and uninspiring (not to\nmention ridiculous in parts: I quote\nCharlie Sheen's script; 'It's time for me to\nstop being scared. And for other people\nto start.'), and above all nothing\nsurprising happens.\nOkay, so I lied. There is one interesting\nand surprising scene: Clint gets raped by\nthe head female bad die. Really it's up to you guys and gals to\ndecide if you want to shell out a fiver to\nsee a film you've seen before at least two\ndozen times.\nAlien Sex Fiend.\nThe acting, as one would expect from\nthe range of talent on offer\u2014everyone\nfrom Michael Horden through Miranda\nRichardson to Joan Sims\u2014, is superb. The\nperiod detail, on both rich and poor\nlevels is flawlessly recreated and the basic\nplot is a very interesting one. So why\ndoesn't the film quite succeed?\nIt is, in a word, flabby. It runs for over\n2 V* hours, yet the real plot only really\ncomes into its own in the last hour or so.\nMuch of the rest of the space is taken up\nwith little glances of people and situations\nand people of whom we see and learn\nlittle more. The viewer is left confused by\nthe panoply of characters, without any\nreal idea of what it is he is watching. To\nhave to sit through an hour of what\nverges on boredom (I saw at least one of\nthe more elderly critics doze off) for a sparkling last half hour is not the way to\nan audience's heart. This should have\nbeen great, it is merely average.\nPendragon.\nNarrow\nWARNING: Don't see this film if you\nsuffer from a heart condition. If you\ndidn't have one when you went in\nyou will when you come out.\nThe plot is a fairly tired one. An unseen\nwitness to a mob killing refuses to give\nevidence, the mob find her, they try to\nkill her (with a helicopter gun ship!) and\nthe police try to protect her. There then\nfollows a chase across Canada on a trail\nfull of tension and suspense.\nGene Hackman (as the attorney\nprotecting the witness) delivers a very\ngood performance but it will still take\nsomething very special to surpass\nMississippi Burning. Unfortunately, the\nbest actor in the film, M Emmett Walsh\nwho plays Sergeant Benti, is killed off far\ntoo early. His happy, jolly personality\nwould have contrasted extremely well\nwith the overall tense nature of the film.\nAny complaints? Well, the filming of\nsome of the scenes left much to be\ndesired. The model trains are very\nreminiscent of my childhood days! Surely\nthey could do better than this?\nA good film that deserves to do well, in\nwhich there are enough twists and turns\nto keep you guessing until the very end.\nIan Hodge\n\n"

    "content": "Scribblers' Corner..\nCorrect, Just Bullshit\nLETTERS\nDear Sir,\nJohn Major says that he wishes to\ncreate a classless society and I believe\nhe's sincere. They say actions speak\nlouder than words, so he should start by\nwithdrawing all government aid to the\narts council and the arts industry as a whole. Last year they received \u00a3500\nmillion (including tax exemptions). I am\nan ardent Chelsea supporter and last year\nthe club paid \u00a31.61 million in taxes. Only\nfootball\u2014the culture of the masses\u2014is\ntaxed and the money given as a subsidy\nto the arty-far ty culture vultures who\nenjoy ballet, opera and serious theatre,\ni.e. the performing arts. In the main those\npursuits are enjoyed by a monied\nminority who have their pleasures\nsub sidi sed by the massive majority. I don't expect to be given money or get\ncheaper tickets to watch football. So why should pretentious prat s in bow ties?\nWell I am informed that the arts are\nBritish culture. British culture? What, a fat\nIti in a dress, prancing up and down the\nstage singing in a high voice. Or maybe\nBritish culture is men with cricket boxes\nstuffed down the front of their tights,\nchucking about an anorexic woman. Well\nthat ain't my culture.\nIam also informed that the arts are\nbeautiful to watch. Well I find a40 yard\npass by Andy Townsend to find Kerry\nDixon, who then scores, as beautiful, but\nagain this is not sub sidi sed. Last year the RSC had to close two of\nits theatres in the Barbican because it\ncouldn't afford to keep them open. We\nwere told how terrible this would be for\nthe country. Quite obviously no one gave\na toss. What normal people are\nconcerned about is if they can get a bed\nin a hospital or their elderly parents have\nenough money to survive.\nThe government, quite rightly, refused\nto sub sid is e unprofitable pits which\ncaused the miners' strike. Nor did they\nsub sid is e the unprofitable docks which\nused to be in the heart of the East End.\nSo what is so bloody special about the\narts?\nAs a free market eerI don't believe\nanyone's leisure activities should be\nsub sidi sed. But if the government insists\non doing this let's sub sid is e pensioners'\nbingo, or I 'll have some of the money, so\nme and my friends can go out to the pub,\nhave a game of darts and then go and\nhave Pie, Mash and Jellied Eels. \u00a3500\nmillion would go a very long way!\nThe money should not be spent on\npathetic government bashing ethnic fringe\ntheatres or on stuck up groups of wealthy\naris to s. It should be given to the NHS\nwhich is in need of funds. Talking of\nstuck up groups of people, I bet Matthew\nSalter likes the arts. Who knows, that\nmoney could be spent on giving him his\nbadly needed brain transplant. After John\nMajor has finished with the arts industry\nhe should turn his eye to the matter of\npublic schools and 'the old school ties'.\nHowever you must feel sorry for those\nprivileged few. Particularly when you see\nwhat the schools have made them into.\nYours,\nAlan Bailey.\nP.S. In the last few letters against me\nthere have been five references to\nxenophobic, four bigots and three racists.\nCome on lads lets have some new insults.\nOr how about describing my letters as\nthey really are. Correct, just and sensible.\nPro British Defence\nDear Andy,\nIn his letter last week, Jason Pike stated\nthat, ' All those writing against the right to\nabortion have invoked God as the\nauthority justifying their case'.\nI would like to point out that the ICU\nPro-Life Society is non-religious, and any\nletters or articles written on behalf of the\nsociety have not and will not 'invoke\nGod'.\nOur members' belief that human life\nmust be respected at all stages of\ndevelopment stems from their own\nparticular moral code. Naturally for some\nthis is part of their religious belief, but for\nthose who do not ascribe to any religion,\nthe seemingly widespread opinion that\nanyone sym a the tic to the Pro-Life cause\nis a religious fundamentalist can be very\nirritating, not to mention damaging to the\nway people view the society.\nIn short, we welcome members of any\npersuasion\u2014athies ts and believers (of any\nvariety).\nI hope this sets things straight.\nYours sincerely,\nRebecca Walter, Secretary ICU Pro-Life.\nDear Andy,\nPlease convey my thanks to Amin ElKholy for another super ei lio us, derogatory and patronising letter, this\ntime directed at me.\nThis business of cultures is so obviously\ntrivial that I'm amazed he bothered\ndragging it out longer. I hope I can settle\nthe matter once and for all.\nIt all began in FELIX882, when Amin made some unpleasant remarks about the\nBritish, suggesting we are a nation of\nbelligerent, xenophobic drunkards. In 888\nhe denounced these remarks as tongue in\ncheek, and I accept they probably were;\nnevertheless I feel they should never\nhave been made. I wrote back in 885\nsaying, hold on! Britain ain't that bad! For\ndaring to defend my country's reputation\nI am branded 'narrow, nationalistic and\nbigoted'.\nBigoted? Defnitely not. It's quite true\nthat I hold strong opinions on many\nsubjects, opinions which I will voice and\ndefend if I can be bothered. However, I always encourage debate, argument and\ndiscussion. Constructive criticism rather\nthan insults from Mr El-Kholy would be\nwelcome.\nNationalistic? Perhaps. All I said were a few words about what I like about\nBritain. I could have done the same about\nIreland, France, Bulgaria, Morocco, or\nany country I know anything about.\nAnyone has the right to dislike this\ncountry, and to try to change it; I ask for\nthe right to defend the things in Britain I consider worth retaining. If that is being\nnationalistic, then so be it.\nNarrow? This is a pretty broad subject.\nI think I 'll pass on it.\nIn his last paragraph Mr El-Kholy\nreached some quite interesting\nconclusions from the one sentence I wrote pertaining to the Gulf Crisis.\nInteresting, and mostly wrong, keep it up,\nAm.I went to the anti-war demo in\nTrafalgar Square, to observe rather than\nparticipate. What particularly annoyed me\nwas the tremendous anti-American feeling\nexpressed in placards and speeches, and\nthe naive attitude that America is the sole\nsource of all tension in the Middle East.\n21\n\n"

    "content": "Child's Play2 Have you ever seen film and not\nbeen able to work out if it's meant\nto be a joke? That's the problem I had upon seeing this film. The first two-thirds of the film are filled with scenes\nthat are laughable in the extreme, but\nyou're never sure whether or not this is\ndeliberate.\n1 confess to not having seen Childs Play\n(although on the strength (?) of this sequel\nit's doubtful that I will), but it appears to\nhave revolved around the possession of a toy doll by the spirit of a psychotic mass\nmurderer who dabbled in voodoo as a side line. He committed this foul and evil\nact of subjugation in order to cheat death\nat the hands of the Police (yawn).\nSurprisingly enough, however, the doll\nwasn't his first choice, but the only body\nnearby at the time. Now he faces a problem; unless he transfers his spirit to a human soon he'll be trapped forever in\nthe body of the doll (isn't it convenient\nhow the laws of magic make for useful\nplot devices?).\nSo in the first film the bad die attempts\nto take over the body of a young child,\nkilling several people in the process (you\ncan't teach an old mass-murderer new\ntricks), but ends up being fried in some\nform of explosion.\nThe sequel begins after the Police\ninvestigation into the murders, in which the child testifies as to the guilt of the\nEndGame\nI Weird is the best way to describe\nthis, weird but interesting. It is a study of a person's twilight years\nthat can be all too depressing yet has\nenough humour to avoid being too\nmoribund.\nThe acting is very good, with all four\ncharacters coming across well, despite the\nfact that you only get fleeting glimpses of\ntwo of them (they're in dustbins).\nThe main themes: life, death and not\nwanting to change from one to the other,\nare very proudly and capably handled.\nThe result, a play that captures your\nheart and mind and holds them until the\nvery end.\nIan Hodge\n\u2014 Film \u2022Theatre\ndoll, as does his mother. She is promptly\nlocked up in an institution, and the kiddie\nsent to a home. The company who\nmanufactures the dolls get hold of the\noffending little chap and rebuilds him in\nan attempt to stave off the bad publicity,\nand reassure their stock holders.\nThe kid then gets adopted, the newly\nremade doll runs amok, and you can\nguess most of the rest. In all it's not a very good film; the only thing about it\nthat's actually scary is putting yourself in\nPiano\nthe shoes (small though they are) of the\nchild. Confronted by an animated killer\ndoll you would assume that as long as\nyou could convince an adult that you\nweren't lying, then everything would be\nalright. He does this in the first film, and\nthey lock his mother up. If you must see\nit, then my advice is to partake of the\nwonders of modern chemistry\nbeforehand. You' ll find it more amusing.\nAlien Sex Fiend.\n' ; - \u2022\u2022\u2022\n[A lot of people find Chekhov\nI dispiriting, depressing and even\nstuffy but there's no denying that,\nfor his time, he dissected the Russian\naristocracy with great precision and\npsychological accuracy.

In\n^ \u2022 J LUa^ B their youth they had both\nbeen arrested and beaten with\ntruncheons. Like many other Kurds, their\nnational identities had been forged and\nnurtured by this suppression. Punishment\nand tortures they had witnessed involved\nforcing women to sit on broken bottles,\nor being stripped and blasted with high\npressure water. After the abduction and\nmurder of his parents, Abdol's younger\nbrother left home to join the PKK guerrillas in the mountains. For over a year Abdol tried to contact him searching\nthe countryside, armed with photographs.\nSuch is the secrecy of the PKK' s movements that he has not seen his\nbrother since he left home. Most Kurds\ndisapprove of the PKK' s violent methods,\nbut with government brutality on the\nincrease Abdol's pride in what his brother\nis doing is also increasing.\nThere are allegedly over 400,000 troops\nin the Kurdish areas, arbitrarily arresting\nvillagers and frequently beating up and\ntorturing them to obtain information\nabout the PKK. Many detainees die under\nthese conditions. In January, 1989, a mass\ngrave was reportedly found in a refuse\ntip outside Siirt. A government inquiry\nwas 'inconclusive'.

God and\nTheomania yourself and listen to the real\nthing.\nThe second B side is possibly even\nworse. Think of Creaming Jesus's Forest,\nmake the cover about a million times\nworse, remove the humour and you'll\nhave an approximation of Carter's version\nof Bedsitter. Mark Almond must be\nspinning in his Bryl-Creamed hair. This\nmade me shake.\nThe Paleoethnobotanist.\no sport Blackbird\n-Compilation Album\nBlackbird are two brothers. Blackbird are\nAmerican. Blackbird have toured with\nRed Lorry Yellow Lorry and it shows.\nThe same driving rhythms and repetitive\nguitar riffs can be found on this album, a compilation of their 'bent' tracks so far.\nUnfortunately for them, the Lorries\nsimilarity doesn't quite come off.\nBlackbird haven't got quite enough\npower, enough black in their hearts, to\ndeliver a crushing enough beat. The\nordering of the album does them no\nfavours either, jumping fairly randomly\nbetween the rockier side of t eir nature\nand an almost electro sensibility. Again,\nyou get the feeling this isn't quite\nworking as well\u2014soft tinged electro is to\nnobodies taste. And the music pales into\ninsignificance when coma pared to\nstable mates Revolting Cocks.\nOh, I 've run out of things to say.\nPerhaps this is significant\u2014the album\nleaves you feeling slightly numb in a soporific way. It's mainly the voice, the\none constant factor throughout the LP.\nIt's strong, but so's a lump of steel that's hardly interesting.\nOne track is quite interesting\u2014a Lou\nReed cover seemingly heavily influenced\nby some sort of electro-beat, perhaps the\nbest song on the LP and pointing the way\nto the future?\nBlackbird may have a future ahead of\nthem if they can escape their influences\nand learn to live a bit. Even the Lorries\nchanged eventually.\nThe Paleoethnobotanist.\nThe Real People\n-Let Me In 12\"\nCBS have obviously gone looking for the\n'trendy northern sound' and have come\nout the other side with The Real People.\nSure, they have nicked 77ie Farm's twi ddl y guitar line and The Charlatan's baggy bits to achieve an 'authentic'\nManchester sound that nicely fits the\naccepted mould, and it lol lops around at\nits own happy-go-lucky pace, perfectly at\nhome vibrating your rib cage on the\ndance floor and ust as well on the five\nwatt stereo.\nSo this begs the question, do\naccountants and businessmen have taste?\nNo, of course not. The likes of Dee-Lite\nhave shown the way forward, effectively\nstealing the wind from Manchester's sail,\nand seeing as CBS have tried to find 'the\ncutting edge' they've shot themselves in\nthe foot, as they are about a year behind\neveryone else.

    "content": "St\nFELIX\nThe Careers Advisers give Felix the rundown on Employers' opinions of ICStudents...\nSo What Is Wrong With Us ?\nThe date that is firmly fixed in our diaries\nis January 16; the start of the 1991\nMilkround. For the next eight weeks or\nso, we know that 'if it's lasagne it must\nbe Tuesday...' Why? Because every day\nthe Careers Advisers take the visiting\nemployers to lunch in a corner of the\nSCR, and talk to them. Not only do we attempt a marketing job on all the IC\napplicants to their organisations: 'they're\nbright, streetwise, ambitious and have\nhighly developed analytical skills'. We say\nconfidently across the Tunchtable. ' And they're used to working hard...'\nBut lunchtime conversations, like\ninterviews, are two way processes and\nwe thought you might like to ponder on some of the less flattering things\nemployers said about people like you last\nyear. Competition for sought after jobs is\nmuch fiercer this year and to be\nsuccessful you really need to plan your\nstrategy carefully\u2014so we've given a few\npointers to help you get over the first\ninterview hurdle, at least. We' ve divided\nthe 'quotes' up to reflect the different\nstages of the interview, rather than in order of importance.\nSome of them don't even know their\nway around the College\nLots of Milkround interviews take place in departments and not in the rooms around\nthe Careers Service. If you find that you will have to find a room in an unfamiliar\nbuilding it's worth discovering it's exact\nlocation well before the event. Turning\nup late, and out of breath, will do you no favours.\nSome candidates are so nervous it's impossible to find out about their\nsuitability\u2014or otherwise.\nIt is nerve w racking attending an important interview, but try to do\neverything possible to relax beforehand.\nYou'll give a much better impression to\nthe employer if you appear calm and can\nconcentrate on the exchange of questions\nand answers. Being fully prepared, so that\nyou feel confident about handling general\nquestions about yourself, your skills,\nexperience and ambitions related to their\narea of employment will help. Practice\nthe sorts of things you may say in response to the obvious questions\n(including the difficult ones) either with a friend or on your own, safely locked in\nthe bathroom!\nConversely\nSome of your students are very full of\nthemselves, feel they will be doing us\na favour if they deign to join us.\nWith very few exceptions, most\nemployers are put off by an extravagant\nshow of confidence. Be aware of your\nabilities and your track records, but don't mm Jt lil ll tii^ lt\n\u00a5\n0mmm push it at your interviewer. Remember, if\nyou are offered a job it will be because of\nyour potential, rather than your past.\nMost employers view graduates as very\nraw (but valuable) material.\nA common one..\nInterviewing some of your people is\nvery hard work\u2014like getting blood\nout of a stone.\nIf you don't tell them about yourself how\nwill they be able to assess your\nsuitability? 'Yes' or 'No' answers won't get\nyou the job and most interviewers will\ndeliberately ask you 'open' questions to\nprevent you giving very short replies.\nRemember that you are marketing\nyourself during an interview, building on the information already provided in your\napplication. Think of your 'selling points',\nand consider what sort of person\nspecifications your interviewer will have\nin mind for the work that interests you.\nAnd tell them why they should be\ninterested in you.\nThere's always someone who can't remember what he put on his\napplication form.\nDon't let it be you! Always keep a copy\nof your application and read it through\nbefore the interview.\nThe work...\nIt's amazing how many people apply\nfor work that they know nothing\nabout.\nEvery year some jobs become very\nfashionable. Names like 'Strategy\nConsultancy' or 'Corporate Finance' are\nbandied around. Whatever you apply for,\nmake sure that you understand the aims\nof the department and how the staff work\ntogether to achieve targets. Do this by talking to people already established in\nsimilar jobs, by reading the appropriate\ntrade magazines and national press. It's much easier to bluff in an application\nthan face to face...\nThey say they're planning a career in\nour business, but they haven't bothered to read beyond our\nbrochure...\nThe information available to everyone in\nthe Careers Office is just a starter\u2014\nespecially for the most competitive areas.\nRead as much background material as\nyou can find (Business and Institute\nLibraries can be a wonderful source of\ninformation). Possibly set up a file of\nuseful articles and notes to look through\nbefore the interview. Speak to as many\npeople as possible about the industry in general and develop your own opinions\nabout how things may change over the\nnext couple of years. If you do this, you should be able to handle most questions,\nincluding the awful 'In your view...how is\nthis likely to affect X?' with a fair show of\nconfidence. Your answers don't have to\nbe right, but there has to be an obvious\nrationale to them.\nWe look for analytical skills and\nexpect this to stretch into personal\nawareness and career planning...\nNot every employer will expect you to\nhave firm ideas about where you intend\nto be in five, or ten years time. But most\nwill expect you to have applied some\nanalysis to yourself\u2014what skills,\nexperience and personality you can\ncontribute to their organisation. A careers\nadviser will help you tackle this, if\nnecessary, and there are some useful\nworkbooks in the Careers Service to help\nyou get your head in order.\nHow can some of them be so out of\ntouch with current affairs?\nSurprise, surprise\u2014lots of students don't listen to, or read the news\u2014and certainly\ndon't really think about how world events\nmay affect their career choice. Coming up\nto interviews, it's worth reading a 'quality' paper most days\u2014and if you are\nconsidering high flying finance or consultancy, then The Economist should\nbe included on your list along with the\nFT. Scan the business pages for anything\nthat involves your chosen employers\u2014it's deeply embarrassing not to be aware\nthat, for instance, the company\ninterviewing you is in the midst of\nmerger talks, or planning major\ninternational expansion.\nI'm not convinced that any of them\nhave really thought through the\nprocess of studying for professional\nexams in addition to a real job.\nThis comment\u2014made mainly by chartered accountants, is very important,\nif you are serious about gaining your\nchosen qualification. Your interviewers\nwill expect you to have a plan, be aware\nof your most effective methods of study\nand have thought about the effects the\ncombination of work and study will have\non your leisure activities\u2014especially team\nsports. They're also looking for real\nmotivation to achieve the qualification.\nEvidence shows that people who are not\nabsolutely committed to gaining such\nprofessional status\u2014regardless of cost\u2014\nare much more likely to fail exams, or drop out. The employers don't want to\ntake that risk\u2014it's expensive.\nWhy do some of them feel everything\nhappens in London?\nMany employers require considerable\nmobility during training. It's helpful to be\nopen-minded and flexible about your\npreferred locations.\nTowards the end of interviews you will\nbe given the opportunity to ask questions.\nWe keep being asked about our\ninternational opportunities\u2014they don't seem to realise that we can't send\nthem abroad until they can make a real contribution.\nAnalytical skills again\u2014read the brochure,\nspeak to people and be ral is tic in your\nexpectations. Sometimes students give the\nimpression that they're applying because\nof the opportunity to travel, rather than\nbecause they could make a real\ncontribution to the work of an organisation.\nThey're all asking about 'the\npackage'\u2014salaries, holidays, perks,\netc. I begin to wonder if they're really\ninterested in the job.\nIt's wise to hold onto most of these\nquestions until you've actually been\noffered the job. Often people doing\ncampus interviews really don't know the\nanswers to these questions, and it can\nleave them feeling that you weren't interested enough to ask questions about\nthe work you have applied to do.\nSt\nFELIX\nI'm not convinced that everyone I see\nis really interested in our jobs.\nToo true...many of you will be\ninterviewed for jobs that are second\nchoices. Others will attend early\ninterviews to gain experience of\nanswering questions. But if you are really\ninterested in an organisation, don't be\nafraid to show it. Do your research\nthoroughly and think carefully about the\nskills and experience that they are\nlooking for, that you can offer. Be enthusiastic and smile!\nSome of them ask questions that have\nalready been answered elsewhere.\nDon't ask questions that have already\nbeen answered in the brochure/video, or\nat the presentation or even earlier in the\ninterview. Some candidates have\nprepared questions that they seem to\nwant to ask regardless of its worth at this\nstage.\nOf course, most employers say very\nflattering things about their IC\ninterviewees\u2014let's hope you will be one\nof them!\nGood luck from the Careers Advisers.\nRuss Clarke\nShiona Llewellyn\nBill Fox\nWANT TO KNOW\nMORE!\nYou can contact any of\nthe above advisers on\next 3251\nHend-a Brike\nPETER THOMAS BICYCLE\nREPAIRS\nSALES\nAND ACCESSORIES\n4-6 Effie Road\nFulham, London SW6 IT D071371586745 "

Desmond's mix of\nreggae and ska with a wicked funky\nupfront boogie has brought the inimitable\nsound of Desmond Dekker into millions\nof homes throughout his incredible\ncareer. Most famous of his hits is The\nIsraelites which sold over five million\nagain.\nIn complete contrast the Love Kittens\nhave a much more up to date sound. At\nfirst sight they appear to be a typical in di pop/dance crossover following the recent\nupsurge in popularity this music is having\nat the moment. But they are not, they\nhave something that the rest of these\nbands, eg Northside/The High etc do not\nhave which is originality. Rave reviews\nfrom all the music press have made this\none of the finds of 1990 and a sure thing\nfor success in 1991.

    "content": "Editorial Well, just to be totally radical I'm going\nto take the immortal advice of Basil\nFawlty and not mention the war. I'm going to talk about something much closer to our hearts. No, not the nerve\ngas in the Iraqi Embassy, but:\nThings that suck, no. 1: Extending\nthe College Day\nRight, let's get a few things straight\n(don't even think it). The whole thing (I was going to say idea, but that gives it\nmuch more credit than it deserves)\nstarted with two goals in mind. By, the\nway, when I say 'started' I mean that it\nhas now. Whether or not the Rector had\ngone as far as to think up a justification\nfor screwing us all before setting up the\n'Working' Party is not certain. Anyway, the excuses they're giving now are:\n(i) To ease the pressures on such places\nas the QT, refectories, and the Union\nSnack Bar that are caused by a uniform\nlunch hour.\n(ii) To provide more lecture and lab\nspace by giving more hours in the\ntime-table.\nIn order to ease these problems they\nproposed to have different lunch hours\nfor different groups within the College,\nand to start earlier and/or finish later. In\ncase you haven't realised, the first would\nscrew clubs that meet at lunch time, the\nsecond, well, think of a problem (hint:\nThere's loads: Cleaners unable to finish\nwork before college starts, women travelling home later, staff having trouble\ngetting to and from home, not to mention\nthe stress of longer hours at work for\nstudents and staff, etc.etc.)\nSo, what have they done? Well,\ntypically enough for a committee, very\nlittle. As yet none of the staff, cleaners,\nsecurity or students have been formally\nconsulted, and neither have any of the\nunions concerned. ICU itself is a little\nbetter off, mainly because even His\nRectorness couldn't stop Paul Shanley\n(ICU President) from sitting on the\nWorking Party.\nConsequently some of the CCUs have\norganised surveys, and ICU( under the\nsteady hand of El Presidente) has\norganised both UG Ms and a referendum,\nin order to present the opinion of the\nstudents to the Working(?) Party. Guess\nwhat? In all of them there was a resounding 'fuck off (about 9 0 % against).\nAnd guess what else? They've ignored\nthem. Totally. Apparently the C CU survey\nwas carried out in a manner that was\n'weighted against the proposals', and as\nthere were only just over 500 papers\ncompleted in the referendum it was\n'unrepresentative of the general feeling of\nthe students'. By the way, aUG M only\nneeds 300 to be quo rate, and therefore\npass a motion which could have a huge\naffect on college. As to the U GM result:\nwho knows?\nThey are now proposing a College day\nof 9-6, with a one hour lunch from 1-2.\nThat's really going to help point (i), isn't it? As to point (ii), staff that I 've spoken\ntoo think that the problem is more one of\norganisation and co-operation between\ndepartments. To this end College, in a totally uncharacteristic fit of clear-headed\nsensible ness, have decided to have a space audit (kind of like a financial audit,\nbut with rulers instead of the Fraud\nSquad). We live in hope as to its results.\nOur last chance to do something comes\nnext Tuesday (the 22nd) lunchtime, at 1\npm, in the JCR when the Union is holding\nan Extraordinary (read EMERGENCY) General Meeting, or EG M for those of you that like initials. For God's sake, for OUR sake, for anybody that you care about's sake, BE THERE! It's only an hour of\nyour time, and without it, we're at the\nmercy of whatever the fuck they want to\ndo. Pretty please.\nThings that suck, no. 2: War\nOkay, so I lied; Iam going to mention\nit. A quick review of the situation up until\nmidnight our time on Wednesday the 9th.( Bear with me for a sec, there is a point.\nHonest).\nSaddam Hussein claws and back-stabs\nhis way to power. Time passes. He goes\nto war with Iran, with Western (not just\nAmerican) backing. The war lasts eight\nyears. In this time his economy takes a dive (surprise), so he borrows lots of\ndo sh, mainly from other Arab states,\nincluding the very rich Kuwait (remember\nthat - it's important). The war ends\ninconclusively. Saddam has big debts, and an economy that makes America look\nhealthy. He also has an overwhelming\nAS F Bit\nambition (publicly stated many times) to\nsee a combined Arab nation (guess who he'd like to see in charge. Remember this\n- it's important). Kuwait starts to call in its\nloans. Spurred on by this example\n(remember the word 'example' - it's important) several other Arab nations do\nthe same. Saddam can't pay( surprise).\nHis own solution to this problem is, as\nthey say, history. By invading Kuwait he\nkills three birds with one stone (clever\nmove. Or so he thought): He makes an\nexample (told you it was important) of\nKuwait, thus discouraging the other Arabs\nfrom trying to get their money. He also\nplanned to loot the rather over laden coffers of Kuwait, easing his economy\n(not to mention the oil). Lastly he takes\nstep num ero uno towards domination of\nthe Middle East. What a clever chap (I'm actually being sincere).\nUnfortunately for him... Well, you know\nthe rough story. I don't think anyone\nwould deny that Saddam Hussein (notice\nthat I refer to him, not Iraq. He is to\nblame for the actions of his country) had\nno right to invade Kuwait (arguments that\nrevolve around events that occurred\nnearly a century ago are idiotic). There is\nno moral justification for why he has\ndone it, and what he' s been doing since.\nHe cannot be allowed to stay. Kuwait,\neven all the other Arab nations couldn't and can't stop him.\nBut, as I 've said, war sucks. However,\nfor negotiations to be effective there have\nto be two willing participants. Men like\nHussein cannot be allowed to do as they\nwish. They must be stopped, just as Hitler\nhad to be stopped. Thus we come to the\ncrux of the problem: War sucks, but\nnegotiation won't work. The UN have\ndecided on their course. Before we condone or condemn, we must think\nwhat we would do, and be honest in our\nappraisal of how realistic our suggestions\nare.\nCredits:\nTypesetting & Printing: Rose and Andy News Editor: To by Arts Editor: Adam T.

    "content": "Security\nnil at Imperial Ml Statement by Benjamin Turner, Union Deputy President, on\nbehalf of Imperial College Union\nStatement by Valerie Straw,\nFacilities Manager, on behalf\nof Imperial College\n'The Security Forces have given the\nCollege reason to believe that there is no\ncause for concern about the nature of the\npeople or material in the Iraqi Embassy\nor the surrounding area. The police\npresence around the Embassy has\nreverted to the normal levels that would\nbe expected in the present political\nclimate. They are there for the protection\nof the Embassy staff and in case of\npossible demonstrations.\nThere is no reason whatever why the\nactivities of the College should not carry\non as normal.'\nMany students may have heard various\nrumours concerning the Iraqi Embassy on\nQueensgate.\nNew.Scotland Yard have confirmed that\nNONE of these rumours are substantiated.\nThe most popular rumour is that large\nquantities of nerve gas are stored in the\nbasement of the Embassy. This rumour\nwas initiated by a poorly researched\narticle in the Daily Star, some two\nmonths ago, and is unfounded.\nWithout referring to statements from\nauthorities, various responsible people\nwithin departments, notably Chemistry,\nElectrical Engineering, Mechanical\nEngineering and Geology, have been\nannouncing to lecture theatres full of\nstudents that the rumours are correct.\nThey are often advising students not to\ncome into College.\nClearly, there is no College policy that\nstudents should not come onto campus. If\nsuch a policy had been necessary, it\nwould undoubtedly have originated from\nspecific instructions from the Security\nauthorities to the Rector, and students\nwould have been advised of this policy\nwithout delay.\nI advise the students of Imperial College\nto ignore such scare mongering. Swimming Pool Off Colour St Mary's Beds\nImperial's swimming pool was closed on\nWednesday morning due to d is coloured water. An official at the sports centre said\nthat chemical levels in the pool were\nnormal and were not unsafe. He added\nthat the pool still had to be closed for\nsafety reasons since the bottom could not\nbe seen.\nThe Sports Centre was partly closed on\nMonday whilst lockers were replaced in\nthe changing room. The new lockers\nrequire lOp piece which is not returned.\nThis has annoyed users of the centre,\nwho must now pay each time they wish\nto lock-unlock the lockers. The current\nannual student season ticket rate is \u00a312:\nregular users may now have to pay more\nthan \u00a312 extra per year just for the\nprivilege of locking their clothes.\nNext Wednesday, 23 January, Dr R Henderson, FRS, of Cambridge University\nis expected to lecture in the Physics\ndepartment on 'Proton Pumps in Nature'.\nThe detection of light in the retina of\nour eyes is a quantum process, and the\nkey is a protein called rho do ps in. Dr\nHenderson will ask (and answer?): how\ndoes this proton pump work? What is its\nstructure? Is there a model? The lecture is\nin the main Physics theatre, level 3, at\n1.15pm. J. From Comets to Computers' is the title of\nan inaugural lecture to be given by\nProfessor R. Hynds next Thursday. It will\nheld at 5.30pm in Lecture Theatre 213\nHuxley.\nProfessor Hynds, from the Computer\nCentre, will be speaking on the high pace\nof change in computing technology,\ntouching briefly on the ULYSSES project\nand low-energy particle experiments.\nIt was rumored this week that beds at\nLondon medical schools, including\nSt.Marys, could be used for war\ncasualties. Injured solders could arrive in\nLondon two weeks after hostilities begin\nalthough students at St.Marys have not\nbeen informed of any planned use of\nbeds.\nCasualties brought to London would\nundergo non-emergency operations\nperformed by hospital doctors rather than\nmedical students.\nBomb Scare\nA bomb scare closed South Kensington\nUnderground station briefly on\nWednesday. After an alert at 1.25pm, the\nstation was closed for an hour,\ninterrupting services on both lines.\nLondon Transport are not releasing\ndetails due to the current climate but did\nsay that there had been several scares\nduring the day.\nAwards\nAnd now the results for 'Research Grant\nStakes'. This month's trophy goes to\nProfessor C. Hopkins who has secured\n\u00a3454,436 over 38 months from the MRC for the 'uptake and intra-cellular\nprocessing of cell surface receptors.'\nThe 'Free-Market Economy Booby\nPrize' for tight-fist ed ness goes to the\nProduction Engineering & Research\nAssociation of Great Britain. They have\nawarded Professor D. West \u00a3750 over 7\nmonths to research 'metal-mix\ncomposites.'\n3\nPumps, Comets\nand Computers\n\n"

    "content": "War, What is it Good For?\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 . \u2022\nst\nFELIX\nWith the US and Britain firmly committed\nto War in the Gulf and the allies adopting\nan inactive position, Chistopher Riley\ntalks to European students about their\nsupport for the task force, conspicuous by\nits absence.\nThis week Kuwaities in Britain breathed a sigh of relief as the UN deadline on Iraq\narrived. They have been called for the\n'rescue' of their country from the ruthless\nclutches of Hussein ever since information\nabout the atrocities started to reach the\nwest. Some 4,000 people have been\ntortured and killed under Iraqi rule since\nAugust. They argue that the inevitable\nfurther deaths that war will bring to the\n19 million Kuwaities still left can only be\nan improvement to the slow, agonising\ntorture and death they have been\nexperiencing over the last six months.\nBut do the Kuwaities left want a 'liberating' war or a unity with Iraq?\nWhat may sound ridiculous is simply an\nirreconcilable difference of cultures\nbetween the Middle East and the West.\nIn Monday's German newspaper Die\nWelt, Dr Karl Bertzel stressed the\ngrowing importance of the two Arabic\nmovements in the Middle East. The first\nfollows the example of Libya, Egypt and\nIraq itself, calling for the present\nfeudalism, to be replaced. The alternative\nis an, as yet, undefined political system\nwhich, through Islamic influences, will\ndiffer from a western style democracy.\nThe second calls for the founding of a Pan-Arabic nation. Is the Invasion of\nKuwait simply a movement towards such\na Pan-Arabic state, which cannot be\nhalted by external forces such as the UN resolutions? 'It is crucial to see both sides\nto the argument', explains German\nstudent Michael Gross. 'The situation in\nthe Gulf has been brought about by the\nwest. After the First World War the UN carved up the Middle East with almost\narbitrary straight lines. It was misguided\nto assume that the newly synthesised\nArab countries would be content with the\nUN's artificial borders. Clearly Saddam\nHussein cannot be allowed to behave as\nhe pleases. Iraq can justify its actions,\nbelieving that they have a right to Kuwait\nas their tenth state. Meanwhile the US is\nbent on its blinkered style of democracy.'\n'In the west we smile at the profits\nmade by selling Iraq the constituents for\nchemical weapons and nuclear capabilities\nduring 'peace time', but once the tables\nare turned, we condemn the use of such\nartillery', explains French engineering\nstudent Frank Vialaron. 'Such an issue\ncan only be settled by the Arab nations,\nthrough a Middle East summit.'\nIf the UN seriously wants to protect\nfreedom and democracy they would\ndemand a referendum within Kuwait to\nreplace the present UN demands. The\ncurrent 'get out or prepare for war'\nultimatum does not allow an option for\nHussein to back down gracefully without\nlosing face. If employed from the start\nsuch a referendum would at least allow a back door to Hussein, so important to the\nArabic system. Bertzel suggests that it\nSome 4,000\npeople\nhave been\ntortured\nand killed\nunder Iraqi\nrule since\nAugust\nwould include the whole of the Kuwaiti\npopulation, not just the ruling elite and\nproposes the following alternatives:\nremoving the present state of feudalism,\nindependence or unification with Iraq.\n'It is naive to think that the US has sent\ntroops to the Gulf to protect democracy.\nWhy then was an international task force\nnot sent to South Africa to eliminate\napartheid. When Iraq declared war on\nIran nothing was done. When China\ninvaded Tibet in 1956 the UN turned a blind eye. The UN has never acted\nstrongly to preserve human rights,\nprefer ing simple declaration' suggests\nItalian Chemical Engineering student\nMauro Costantino. But the French\nperceive Kuwait, as a little western island\nof capitalism in a sea of Arab fundamentalism, the 'Bank of the Middle\nEast', a major supply of oil and 'a paradise of duty free fun'. It is their own interests which are driving the US into\nwar. 'In Panama Noriega was once a puppet of the USA. But once he'd overstepped the mark and his actions no\nlonger suited the US, they invaded\nwithout hesitation to 're-establish\ndemocracy', points out Mauro. Saddam\nHussein is no General Noriega and the\nGulf is no Panama. Casualties will not\nonly be coming back in body bags, but in\nlead-lined coffins.\n\n"
