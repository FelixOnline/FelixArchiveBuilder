A Visit from the Goon Squad // The Candy\nHouse \u2013 Jennifer Egan\nA sci-fi, slightly dystopian novel, that plays with the\nidea of a device that is able to recall and record real\nmemories and share them with others, as with content on social media. A story about how we deal with\nprivacy and authenticity.\n7. The Cat and the City \u2013 Nick Bradley\nThis follows a cat as it travels around Tokyo, visiting\nand interacting with various citizens on its way. The\nlives of these citizens are intertwined, but also stand\nalone. A novel about the ups and downs of everyday\nlife and human connections.\n8. Chronicles From the Land of the Happiest People on Earth \u2013\nWole Soyinka\nA political/\ncrime title, this\nstory set in a\nliterary version\nof Nigeria discusses corruption through\nthe tale of an\nentrepreneur\nwho deals in\nbody parts for\nuse in ritualistic sacrifice.\n9. The Country of Others (Translated) \u2013 Leila\nSlimani\n10. Cult Classic \u2013 Sloane Crosley\n11. Daughter of the Moon Goddess \u2013 Sue Lynn Tan\nBased on the Chinese legend of Chang\u2019e, this\nfantasy novel tells the story of a woman who goes on\na quest to free her mother from exile. In the vein of\nPercy Jackson, the novel draws on Chinese legend to\ncreate a tale full of magic and morals.\n12. Girl A \u2013 Abigail Dean\n13. Happy Ending \u2013 Thien-Kim Lam\n14. (The Underground Railroad // The Nickel\nBoys) // Harlem Shuffle \u2013 Colson Whitehead\n15. How High We Go in the Dark: A Novel \u2013 Sequoia Nagamatsu\nAn episodic sci-fi novel that delves into the consequences of human-caused climate catastrophes. The\npremise is of a virus being released by the melting of\npermafrost, and the story spans from Earth to the\nmoon, and back. The tales are eerily familiar, clearly\ninspired by recent events.\n16. The Hummingbird (Translated) \u2013 Sandro\nVeronesi\n17. I Will Die in a Foreign Land \u2013 Kalani Pickhart\n18. Klara and the Sun \u2013 Kazuo Ishiguro\nKlara is an android \u2018friend\u2019 with artificial intelli-gence, who spends her days watching customers and\npotential friends roam the streets and the store she\nresides in. A sci-fi and fantasy book that follows closely in the footsteps of Ishiguro\u2019s other novels, exploring\nthe intricacies of human and technological connec-tions.\n19. Lessons in Chemistry \u2013 Bonnie Garmus\nThe story of a chemist in the 1960s who is also a\nsingle mother. While not given her due recognition\nin the field of chemistry, she finds this respect and admiration through her methods of applying chemistry\nto cooking on TV. Both a commentary on historical\nattitudes towards women\u2019s rights and an unusual take\non a romance novel; an amusing read.\n20. Nuclear Family \u2013 Joseph Han\n21. Olga Dies Dreaming \u2013 Xochitl Gonzalez\nA politically-charged romance novel covering topics\nsuch as family connections, LGBTQ+ issues, and\nidealism. The titular character is orchestrating weddings for the rich and wealthy of New York when her\nmother returns to visit her and her brother, wreaking\nhavoc in their personal lives.\n22. Raising Lazarus \u2013 Beth Macy\n23. Sea of Tranquility \u2013 Emily St. John Mandel\nSeemingly inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, this\nsci-fi title examines the causes and consequences of a\npandemic on Earth, from various locations both on-world and off. The story bounces between characters\nwho are inevitably interlinked, and explores the concept of time travel and changing the course of history.\n24. The Thursday Murder Club // The Man Who\nDied Twice \u2013 Richard Osman\n25. To Paradise // A Little Life \u2013 Hanya Yanagihara\n\n"

AVIC is one of the sanctioned companies, due to\nits role in supplying jets to the Chinese military.

The \u00a355 million was out of a total of\n\u00a3240 million across the whole of the UK HE sector.\nFurthermore, Imperial academics have also\ncollaborated with Chinese military-linked institutions\nmore often than any other UK institution, with 945\npapers being co-authored since 2015.\nOther partnerships with links to Chinese companies\ncontinue.

The fourpiece\u2019s unusual combination of bassist,\nguitarist, drummer and saxophonist/flau-tist made for a sonically riveting set and\nI was hooked, so when they announced\na gig all the way out in Bromley-by-Bow\n(I\u2019m a West London girl), I didn\u2019t mind\nthe 50-minute trek.\nWandering aimlessly amongst the towering brutalist\narchitecture of East London, we eventually stumbled\nupon The Beehive, a tiny little pub which could probablyholdnomorethanabout100people.I\u2019llbehonest,\nI missed the first few songs because I was in the beer\ngardenandIthoughtthenoisecomingfrominsidewas\na soundcheck, albeit a very tuneful one! I eventually\nrushed inside and was greeted by Warren\u2019s House\u2019s dis-tinctive, jazzy sound. A few things had changed since\nI saw them last, no wind instruments\nthis time but they had added a vocalist which really allowed more of their\npersonality to shine through in the\nmusic.\nThe set consisted of a mixture of\nrhythmically complex and harmonically rich tunes where all members\ncould showcase their musicianship\nand a few noisier, punkier songs that\nfilled the room up. My personal fa-vouriteswerethefinaltwowherebassist/vocalistFlynn\nMulcahy\u2019sraspyvoicetookcentrestage.Thesheerversatility and skill of guitarist Will Spires throughout their\nset allowed Warren\u2019s House to seamlessly shift genres\nyet maintain a cohesive, recognisable sound. Special\nmention must go out to Imperial\u2019s very own Jonathan\nLillie whose tight drumming, groovy style, and complex fills tied it all neatly together into one magnificent\nperformance. Featuring a garish sweater-vest, a whole\nlotta mesh, and eyeliner for days, you never quite knew\nwhere to look when they were on stage. Not only were\nWarren\u2019s House a treat for the ears, but their stage presence and eclectic outfit choices made for a visually interesting performance too.\nA crowd favourite of the night was definitely their\ncover of Dick Dale & His Del-Tones\u2019 \u2018Miserlou\u2019 (or\nwhat the Black Eyed Peas sampled in \u2018Pump It\u2019 if that\u2019s\nmoreyourthing).Thelivelyandiconictunewasawell-timed shift from the slightly more laid-back, chilled-out vibe of previous numbers and brought a whole new\nenergy to the room before they transitioned to more\nupbeat songs as the set came to a close.\nOverall, I\u2019m glad I dragged my friends and made the\njourney to see them and would 100% do it again; they\nwere great to watch and even better to listen to. Keep\nup with them via Instagram @warrenshousemusic.\nSelf-proclaimed jazz punk band Warren\u2019s House rock\nThe Beehive.\nWritten by Amanda Paul Music Writer\nI trekked to East for this so they must be good\nGig Reviews\nWith Freshers\u2019 Week on the horizon and work\ncoming swiftly on the heels of autumn, music\ncan offer solace in these times. But music, like most\nthings, is something that you need at the right time\nand at the right place; especially when it comes to\nclassical music. For most, classical music seems like a\nchore; indeed, sometimes the prospect of it can seem\ndaunting, but again, I reiterate \u2013 right place, right\ntime. In fact, I argue that no field of music is more\ndiverse than classical music. Therefore, for all of you\ncoming to London for the first time and embarking on your student career or for those of you who\nare returning to once again head into the fray, I shall\ngive you a few pieces to send you on your merry way\nand help expand your experience of this fair city and\ngive you a newfound appreciation for the classics.\nThe Concrete Jungle\nLondon is a mesh of concrete criss-crosses, a network of narrow streets and bustling roads. For me\nin particular, it took a while to learn that one must\nhave a sense of purpose and determination when\nnavigating the streets of the city. While you find\nyour way across the city, be it by pavement, tube\nor bus, here is some music which will help you\nget into the zone and turn your steps into strides.\n\u2018Short Ride in a Fast Machine\u2019 by John Adams\nJohn Adams, like so\nmany East Coast American composers of this\nera, has his roots firmly\nwithin the minimalism\ntradition of music (the\nidea that music need not\nbe complex to be effective or evocative). However, there is nothing \u2018minimal\u2019 about this piece at all. Subtitled by the composer\nhimself as a \u2018fanfare\u2019, it is a fury of wind and percussion\nfrom start to finish. He compared it to the feeling of\n\u201c[riding] in a terrific sports car, and then [wishing]\nyou hadn\u2019t\u201d. Indeed, its quick pace and audacious orchestration certainly paint this bold picture. When\nyou find yourself in rush hour traffic, let this piece\nmake glory of your somewhat unfortunate situation.\n\u2018Candide: Overture\u2019 by Leonard Bernstein\nLeonard Bernstein was a pillar of 20th century mu-sic. Also coming from the East Coast, he spent much\nof his time in New York as conductor of the New York\nPhilharmonic. Muchofhismusicwasinfluencedbythe\nsights and sounds of that city. The story of Candide by\nVoltaire has two protagonists endure calamity after calamity in search of each other. Of course, I do not wish\ncalamity on anyone but the music which Bernstein had\nso wonderfully orchestrated encapsulates the bustling\nlifeofthestory\u2019sprotagonistsandthebustlinglifeofcity\ngoerseverywhere.Whenyouhavetoshovepasttourists\noccupying the wrong side of the escalator, let this piece\ngive you the determination to tell them to move aside.\n\u2018Piano Concerto in F: III. Allegro agitato\u2019\nby George Gershwin\nThis has to be one of my favourite pieces of music\nof all time. Many people know Gershwin for his other famous work, \u2018Rhapsody in Blue\u2019. While stunning,\nI believe it pales in comparison to this virtuosic flurry\n\n"

All\nare welcome and encouraged to attend.\nLiv Walthaus, Haaris Asghar, Hendrik Beck\nImperial PhD students\nContinued from page 1\nroles or participation in clubs and societies. At the\ndirestend,studentsmaybeforcedtoconsiderdropping\nout entirely \u2013 this is evidenced by the fact that 52% of\nstudents in the UK are considering dropping out due\nto financial reasons, up from 41% last year.\nYes, you read that right. The majority of students\nin the UK have considered dropping out of university\nentirely because they can no longer afford it.\nThe Union\u2019s Consultation\nThisissuehasrisentothetopofthelistoftheUnion\u2019s\npriorities. In July 2022, we responded to a consultation\nfrom Universities UK on how students are currently\nfacing the cost-of-living crisis. We only had one week\nto respond, but pulled together various sources of data,\nincluding a social media poll with over 700 responses,\nanonymised data from the Advice Centre, ticket sales\nfor the 2022 Summer Ball, and written responses from\nelected representatives and liberation officers.\nWhat we found is that, unsurprisingly, 95% of\nstudents who responded to the polling are concerned\nabout the cost-of-living crisis. 58% of students are\nworried about their ability to pay rent, and 20% are\nworried about their ability to pay their bills. When we\nlooked deeper into these issues in the Advice Centre,\nwe found that students are particularly concerned with\ntheir ability to pay rent on time, and many students\nare experiencing anxiety due to concerns around their\nability to afford living in London after graduation. 9%\nof students are also concerned about their ability to\npay tuition fees \u2013 these students make up the majority\nof those approaching the Advice Centre for financial\nissues, and many of them have asked for support\naroundrequestingextensionsonpaymentandapplying\nfor loans and grants. Finally, 13% of students are\nconcerned about their ability to pay for food. We have\nalready signposted three students to the food bank\nvoucher scheme in the Advice Centre, which is three\nstudents too many.\nBased on this research, we have come up with the\nfollowing series of recommendations to the College:\nRaising the Imperial Bursary\nFirst and foremost, both the total level of bursary\nfunding and the income threshold for being eligible\nto receive funding both need to be increased. Unlike\nprevious years, it will no longer be sufficient to move\naround money within that pot to ensure that students\nare receiving funding that is proportional to their\nneeds \u2013 with the recent increases in cost of living, that\npotissimplynotbigenough,andoptingtoredistribute\nit will result in some groups receiving less funds when\nthey\u2019re already struggling to make ends meet. As the\nfounder of Blackbullion put it, \u201cthe bank of mum\nand dad has run out,\u201d which means that all students\non bursary will need all the help they can get \u2013 hence\nwhy the total amount of available funding needs to\nbe increased. Additionally, many students that are\nnot currently on bursary are having to face difficult\ndecisions that they have not had to face before around\ntheir ability to afford their degree. Combined with\nthe fact that the maximum threshold for funding has\nbeen the same since 2012, this calls for a recalculation\nof that metric. Finally, the College needs to consider\nrecalculating their bursary amounts on a yearly basis\nto account for inflation, since currently it is entirely\ndependent on a student\u2019s year of entry. Students are\npaid a flat rate for 3-6 years of their degree with no\nadjustments made for inflation, which means that they\nwill end up poorer in their final year compared to their\nfirst year. The Deputy President (Welfare) will present\nthese recommendations to the College\u2019s Access and\nParticipation Compliance Group on 18th\nOctober.\nMaking Funding more Accessible\nIt is important to acknowledge that not all students\nfacing financial hardship at Imperial are currently\neligible for the Imperial bursary, as this is exclusive to\nundergraduate Home students that have a household\nincome under \u00a360,000. This excludes international\nstudents and postgraduate students, both of which\nmake up roughly half of Imperial\u2019s student population.\nIt is also worth noting that the College has already\nput in a lot of work to support students during these\nunprecedentedtimes,includingincreasingthehardship\nfunds allowance from \u00a34000 to \u00a35000, increasing\nthe cap on rent and energy within that allowance,\nand increasing the President\u2019s PhD scholarship by an\nadditional10%inlinewiththeUKRI\u2019srecentincrease.\nIn order to come up with bespoke recommendations\nto support these groups, we are currently working with\na group of PhD students that have rolled out a survey\non stipends. We are also working on creating a similar\nsurvey that will be rolled out to all Imperial students\n\u2013 the aim of this survey will be to measure the gap\nbetween available funds and financial need, identify\nthe groups of students that are most vulnerable, and\ncreate measures of direct support for those groups. Be\non the lookout for that survey in a future issue of Felix.\n... The cost of living\n\u03d0 How Imperial PhD students are coping during the COL crisis\nOn 8th September , the Deputy President (Welfare) was invited\nto speak on a panel at the Annual Universities UK conference.\nShe advised a room full of vice chancellors on how to support\ntheir students during the cost of living crisis.\n\n"

They had events\nfor all types of members, and being one of the largest\nsocieties I got to meet so many new freshers.\nImperial College\u2019s Investment Society. Founded in\n2015, it has grown rapidly year-on-year to over 1300\nmembers last year. Ryan and George, the societies\npresidents discuss the aim of the society on the\nfollowing page in more detail, but to summarise it, we\nare looking to provide educational events, hands-on\ninvesting opportunities, and build a community for\nanyone looking to learn about finance and investing.\nHaving spoken to some people about the society,\nthey sometimes feel that they don\u2019t know enough\nabout investing to understand topics at events, but so\nmany of our events are looking to teach from the very\nfoundations of investing, and the first career steps that\nyou can take in it.\nI believe that even if you don\u2019t want to go into a\nfinancial career, being part of this society will help you\nto understand so much of what you may be seeing in\nthe current news, with economic factors being at the\nforefront of many political events we are seeing.\nFor example, you may be asking what impact central\nbanks raising interest rates has on the stock market,\nor the bond market, and why we have seen companies\nstock prices such as Netflix and Meta fall so much since\nmid-2021. Many people started investing in 2020 when\nthey saw other people getting great returns, but they\ndidn\u2019t really understand why share prices go up and\ndown. These are the kind of fundamentals that Imperial\nInvestment society aims to teach our members, to help\nthem better understand financial markets and the\ngeneral economy.\nThese Investment columns in the Felix newspaper\nwill be filled with weekly articles from members on the\nwriters team, as well as containing the latest events the\nsociety is running.\nThere are so many opportunities for members to get\ninvolved this year. The Securities Education Certificate\n(SEC) is a course that aims to teach members the\nfundamentals of securities, and with an exam at the end\nit is an achievement that you can mention in future job\napplications.\nThere are also more specialist events and courses\nwe provide, such as learning to code your own trading\nstrategy, taking part in stock pitches and networking\nwith industry professionals. For those interested, we\nalso run our own investment fund, Queens Tower\nCapital, where we have a team of analysts (both new\nand experienced) managing a portfolio, another\nopportunity for members to get hands-on experience\ninvesting and managing capital.\nJoin the society as a member for free through the Unions\nactivities page\nTo keep up to date with the societies latest events,\nthey will be posted on our social media channels linked\nat the bottom of this page, but also by signing up for\nour free membership on Imperial College\u2019s Union page.\nYou will receive the latest information straight into\nyour inbox and be the first to sign-up for events with\nlimited capacity.\nSo again, a very warm welcome to the Investment\nSociety, I really enocourage you to join, make the\nmost of it and see you soon!\nAn Overview of the Society\u2019s Plans\nHello and Welcome...\nADD OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES FOR THE LATEST EVENTS, NEW & OPPORTUNITIES\nHarry Schlote\nInvestment Editor\nWe\u2019re back... and can\u2019t wait to welcome returning, as well\nas new members!

    "content": "TUESDAY 27TH SEPTEMBER 2022\n11\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nOver the summer, I had the opportunity to take part in a UROP\nwith the Imperial Physics Education\nGroup. Physics Education Research\n(PER) is an important subfield of\nscience education. Its focus is on understanding the teaching and learning\nof Physics from a scientific and observational perspective. PER is crucial in\nvarious areas of the department, playing\nan important role in outreach, promoting a sense of belonging within the\ndepartment, and informing the design\nof experimental physics lab courses.\nIsatdownwithmyUROPsupervisor,\nDr Michael Fox, to discuss his work on\nPER. Dr Fox is a Senior Teaching Fellow\nat Imperial with a research focus on\nphysics education. He is also part of the\nStrengthening Learning Communities\nProject at Imperial, which aims to better\nunderstand the student experience, not\nonly within the Department of Physics,\nbut across the Faculty of Natural\nSciences.\nTo begin with, Dr Fox and I spoke\nabout the numerous aims of PER,\nalongside his initial motivations to\npursue PER:\n\u201cPERhasanumberofaimsdepending\nonwhoyouask.Forsome,thefocusison\nbuilding evidence on what constitutes\nbest practice in teaching and learning,\nwhile for others the focus is more\ntowards understanding how people\nlearn the skills, concepts, and ways of\nthinkingassociatedwithphysics.Iwould\npersonally say that I sit in the latter\ngroup, though have strong connections\nto the practical implementation of that\nknowledge in the classroom.\n\u201cWhat made me interested in PER\nwas the ability to take the time to really\nthink about these problems of teaching\nand learning. When I was a school\nteacher,Ioftenfounditreallyinteresting\nto see how students would use concepts\nthey understood in new and unexpected\nways,butIdidnothavethetimetoreally\nponder the connections that led to those\nways of thinking. This was especially\ntrue in the complex environment of the\nphysics practical. Making measurements\nand understanding what they mean\nis a fundamental part of physics \u2013\nand science \u2013 but is often taught\nvery superficially. I really wanted to\nunderstand what it is people learn when\ndoing a practical and how close that\nis to the intention of the teacher. This\nled me to do postdoctoral research in\nthe group of Heather Lewandowski at\nthe University of Colorado Boulder,\nwhose group focuses on researching\nundergraduate teaching labs.\u201d\nWe then discussed the impact of PER\non physics curricula and lab courses at\nImperial, and the role of PER groups\nduring the turbulence of the pandemic:\n\u201cThe curriculum in physics is quite static\nand actually some of the work that I\nhave been involved with at Imperial has\nbeen looking at how the \u201ccurriculum\u201d is\nperceived in the Department of Physics.\nI think in the physics community we are\nreally just starting to ask the question:\nwhat is the curriculum in physics? And\nindeed, there are 4 UROP students who\nhave been working in the department\nthis summer on a project funded by\nthe Institute of Physics to diversify the\ncurriculum, which is being supervised by\nJessWade,IsabelRabey,AmySmith,and\nMark Richards, following best practises\nfrom PER.\u201d\n\u201cFor lab courses, there is a growing\nbody of research on multiple different\naspects of learning in labs \u2013 from\nepistemologies around experimental\nphysics, through to equitable group\nwork dynamics, as well as frameworks\non modelling, critical thinking in labs.\nMore concretely, established PER\ngroups also helped with resources when\nlabs went remote due to the pandemic in\nSpring 2020, such as one project that I\nwas involved in which produced a rapid\nreport on what lab instructors had tried\nto help inform the community when\nplanning for the Autumn semester in\n2020.\u201d\nDr Fox went on to explain the future\npotential of PER, with a particular\nemphasis on the research conducted at\nImperial: \u201cAt Imperial, I am working\nas part of the Strengthening Learning\nCommunities project based in the\nDepartment of Physics. This project\nhas two main strands, one looking at\nattainment data for the past 10 years\nin all physics modules to identify\ndemographic gaps which need to be\naddressed. Jessie Durk, a postdoctoral\nresearch associate, and I are currently\nin the process of analysing this data.\nThe second strand, which Amy Smith\nis doing her PhD on, explores students\u2019\nsenseofbelonginginthedepartment,the\nCollege, and to the discipline of physics.\nThe reason for investigating this second\nstrandistotrytounderstandthereasons\nbehind any attainment gaps, so that we\ncan make more informed decisions to\naddress those gaps.\u201d\nI\u2019d like to thank Dr Michael Fox for\nthe time he dedicated to this piece and\nto my UROP project. It has been an\nexcellent opportunity to learn more\nabout Physics Education Research and\nparticularly how it can transform the\ndesign of labs in physics courses.

This is Oldfield\u2019s second\nsuch role - he served last year as Medgroup\nChair of United Hospitals, a student body\nrepresenting London\u2019s five medical schools.\nHe comes to the ICSMSU (Imperial College School of Medicine Students\u2019 Union)\nrole with a formidable array of experience besides this, having held nine different\ncommitee positions across CSPs and spent two years on ICSMSU.\nCampaign Goals\nOldfield wants to improve Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) at the\nmedical school. His manifesto pledges to actively initiate the suggested outcomes\nof the BMA\u2019s racial harrassment charter. He also wants to support widening\nparticipation in ICSM and focus on prevention and a clear disciplinary procedure\nfor misconduct. He notes the \u201cstark disparity\u201d between Reynolds Bar (frequented\nby primarily by medics) and other facilities in South Kensington. Oldfield aims to\nimprove ICU support for Reynolds in the coming year.\n* Technically speaking, Chris is not an Officer Trustee\nTHE JOB DESCRIPTION\nBye-Law F of Imperial College Union\u2019s constitution sets out\nthe roles of the Officer Trustees. Clause F8 gives a broad job\ndescription and is presented below:\n8. All Officer Trustees shall;\n8.1. Act as a Trustee ex-officio,\n8.2. Fulfil all Presidential and constitutional responsibilities,\n8.3. Execute and develop policy and further the aims and\nobjectives of the Union,\n8.4.

News coverage focused on\nstudent opposition to the installation\nand cited the Union proposal. In the UK,\nALERT was featured by the BBC, The\nGuardian, The Daily Mail and more. Across\nthe pond, The New York Post led with the\nheadline, \u201cWoke college students are \u2018hurt\u2019\nby supposedly \u2018phallic\u2019 abstract sculpture\u201d.\nThe story reached as far as Nairobi, where it\nwas covered by People Daily.

In particular, Daily Mail\nreaders were quick to wade into the debate\nwith their own musings. \u201cThe students\nmust be as thick as whale omelettes and\nstudying mickey mouse degrees,\u201d said\none Mail Online reader. Another agreed\nwith the Union Council\u2019s interpretation,\nbut compared the installation to classical\nRoman art, remarking, \u201cRidiculous. The\nRomans built things with massive c...ks [sic]\ntoo\u201d.

The statue is due\nto be formally unveiled by the College on 3rd\nOctober.\nProfessor Hugh Brady, the recently\ninstated President of Imperial, said, \u201cWe\nare grateful [for] the opportunity to be the\nsetting for a striking new artwork by one of\nthe UK\u2019s foremost living artists.\u201d\nl\u2019snewestmember\n5\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nNEWS\nSir Antony Gormley is a British artist and sculptor, best known\nfor creating theAngel of the North.In 1994,he was awarded the\nannualTurner Prize,amongst the most prestigious art awards in\nBritain.

    "content": "of keys. Heavily influenced by the New York jazz scene,\nthis piece has been the show-stopper for many famous\npianists - Oscar Levant and Andre Previn to name but\na few \u2013 and it\u2019s very easy to\nsee why. It is a huge wake\nup call from start to fin-ish; never faltering in its\npace and never relinquish-ing. You may wake up one\nmorning and find yourself\nalready late to your lectures\nand workshops (trust me,\nit will happen) and what better peace to give you the\nstrength to run all the way to campus than this exhibition of the fusion of jazz and classical music.\nStately Grandeur\nI should, of course, highlight that London is not always a frantic bundle of streets and pavements. Upon\ncoming here, you will already notice the sheer number\nofextravagantandelegantbuildingsdottedjustaround\nSouth Kensington. It would be nice if there were music to accompany your visits to the many museums and\ngalleries. I jest, because of course there\u2019s music for that!\n\u2018Westminster Waltz\u2019 by Robert Farnon\nRobert Farnon is a proponent of \u2018Light Music\u2019.\nAnd \u2018light\u2019 is certainly the word for it! It\u2019s simply lush\nswelling strings and schmalzy melodies from start to\nfinish. But what makes this piece stand out, as its title may suggest, is that it has all the familiar sounds\nof Westminster which you will become acquainted\nwith. Often referencing the chimes heard from Big\nBen, one can imagine traversing the streets of Westminster in the early evening when there is a stillness\naround you that can be found beneath the gothic\nhalls and classical columns that dot the landscape.\n\u2018Nonet in E-flat Major: III. Scherzo. Vivace\u2019\nby Louise Farrenc\nFarrenc was a masterful composer and professor of\npiano at the Paris Conservatoire in 1842. Her determination and stunning compositions allowed her to\nstick it to the governing academic body and be granted equal pay along with\nthe rest of her male\ncounterparts. And\nthe piece that finally brought her to the\nfront of Parisian music\nsociety was her Nonet\n\u2013 a wonderful treatise\non how stunning music can be made with so few instruments. The \u2018Scherzo\u2019 movement I\u2019ve chosen here is perhaps the high-light: it\u2019s stately without being pompous, well-paced\nwithout being hurried. One can picture listening\nto this while journeying through all the art galleries of London, soaking in every last drop of culture.\n\u2018Solomon: Arrival of the Queen of Sheba\u2019\nby George F Handel\nI\u2019m not above making basic song choices at all. In\nfact, this piece is almost perfect for the vibe it sets.\nEveryone has heard this piece at some point in their life\nas it often features heavily in film and television when\ndepicting London as a stereotypical English city with\ngood manners and tea and the like. But one can easily\nsee why, the subject matter is about the state visit of a\nmonarch and the music clearly conveys it\nvery well with its fluttering strings and very\nstately wind section.\nIt seems an obvious\nchoice for a London\nlisten.\nThe Secret Gardens\nOne can find London filled with some of the most\ngorgeous green spaces in the UK. Once you\u2019ve hurried\nalong the marble hewn streets without getting run over\nbyabicycleonthecrossingtoHydePark,you\u2019llfinallybe\nable to get some peace of mind. Or maybe you\u2019ll go fur-therafieldtothewilduntamedlandscapesofRichmond\nPark. If only there were a piece of music to go with this!\n\u2018Flute Sonata, Op 164: I. Allegro malinconico\u2019\nby Francis Poulenc\nPoulenc\u2019smusicissoquintessentiallyFrenchitmight\nseemlikeanoddchoicetohavewhenwalkingaboutthe\nLondongardensbutthispiececreatesanatmosphereof\nmystery; of intrigue. When you walk through the gardens of London, often we do it to explore and take in\nour surroundings and this piece fits the bill. The florid\nmelodies from the flute evoke the sounds of birds and\nthe ever present piano the rustling of trees. A must listen for anyone who decides to explore the green spaces\n\u2018Symphony in E Minor, Op. 32, \u201cGaelic Symphony\u201d:\nII. Alla siciliana - Allegro vivace\u2019 by Amy Beach\nThe green spaces of London themselves can be impressive as well as quiet and contemplative. Hyde Park\nand Kew Gardens are huge stretches of green space\nthat boast bold and striking scenery. Amy Beach has\ncaptured the rolling landscapes of the UK perfectly\nwith her grand orchestration and incorporation of traditional folk\nmelodies from across the\nBritish Isles. One cannot help but imagine\npastoral landscapes filled\nwith meadows and babbling brooks upon hearing this symphony \u2013 the first symphony ever\nwritten by a female American composer.\n\u2018Partita for 8 Voices: No. 2, Sarabande\u2019\nby Caroline Shaw\nI must admit I only found this piece the other\nweek upon recommendation from a friend of mine.\nHowever, upon listening I was transfixed and en-amoured. Caroline Shaw won the Pulitzer Prize for\nher Partita and it\u2019s very easy to see why. It\u2019s an exploration of the range of the human voice and incorporates spoken word, sung passages and throat singing all\nused to wonderful effect. To top it off, the Partita (a\ncollection of Baroque dances) fuses conventional harmony with modern minimalist harmony and texture\nto create a truly thought-provoking experience. The\nSarabande movement I\u2019ve chosen here is perhaps my\nfavourite of the set and brings a sense of calm which\nwill go nicely when exploring the gardens of London.\n\u2018The Legend of Ashitaka\u2019 (from \u2018Princess\nMononoke\u2019) by Joe Hisaishi\nStudio Ghibli as an institution that has brought\njoy, emotion and wonder to our generation. Miyazaki\n(founder) is a storytelling genius and a true artist but\nparticular regard must go to his resident composer, Joe\nHisaishi, who I hold as\none of the greatest composers still living today.\nIt would be impossible\nto tell these wonderful\nstories without such epic\nand heart-wrenching\nscores of music to ac-company. This piece in\nparticular accompanies\nshots of wild Japanese scenery, untainted by Man. For\nthose of you wanting to live your \u2018main character moment\u2019, I give you the tools to do so.\nClassical music is a rabbit hole that keeps on going\nwithout end and you will always find new music to fall\nin love with. I leave you with some advice: London is\nvery much a cultural city; make use of the student deals\nthat theatres and concert halls offer and go indulge\nyourself in the arts. I highly recommend the Young\nRoyal Opera House membership. It\u2019s free for students\nand allows you to buy any seat in the large theatre for\njust \u00a325 during the week!

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n10\nCOMMENT\nAt Imperial Soup Run, we distribute\nfood to rough sleepers, people who\nhave lost their job or victims of broken\nhomes on a weekly basis. However, we\nbelieve that something more than just\nmaterial should be done. Therefore, we\ninvited active members of the society to\ntalk about their experiences with Soup\nRun, their insights and vision in an open\nand honest attitude.\nWhat motivates you to join Soup\nRun?\nLaura (active volunteer): I\nencounter homeless quite often on the\nstreet, so it\u2019s a big issue and it\u2019s hard to\nignore it. At the same time there are\ncontroversial remarks about them, like,\n\u201cTheyenduplikethis because they don\u2019t\nwork hard\u201d. I doubt it, and I hope to\nknow them better and learn what their\nlives are like, such as how difficult it is\nforthemtogetajob,whattheyneedand\nwe can do for them. I think one has to\nactually interact with them to learn the\nanswers, and SoupRun is a good place to\nstart.\nA (active volunteer who\nchosetobeanonymous):Thereare\nso many reasons why someone may end\nup homeless including lack of affordable\nhousing, poverty and unemployment. I\nthink it\u2019s only fair that we each do our\nbit to help those who ended up in this\nsituation.\nWhat\u2019syourbiggestgainfrom\nvolunteering in Soup Run?\nA: Volunteering with\nSoupRun has been an eye-open-ing experience. Witnessing\nhomeless people queuing for\nfood Sunday after Sunday has\nhelped me to snap out of my own (com-paratively very small) bubble of prob-lems.\nRitvik (coordinator for\nSoupRun 21/22): The big highlight\nfor me was having an end of week routine where I felt like I was on the ground\nmaking a palpable difference and got to\nlearn about the problems that the homeless faced in London. You meet the most\nextraordinary people, I once met an 18-year-old chess whizzkid who had been\nkicked out of his house for social reasons\nbut his resilience and drive really stuck\nwith me.\nHas volunteering ever changed your\nopinion on this issue?\nLaura: Homeless people need un-derstanding, but not pity. In fact, most\nof them are less desperate for food than\nI imagined. Sometimes it\u2019s not like they\nscramble for all the free food provided,\nthey select what they really need, and\nperhaps what they enjoy to eat. One of\ntheorganiserremindsusthatitisrespect\nthat theyneedthemost.Icametorealise\nthat the right thing to do is not just to\nhelp them survive, but also to let them\nknow that\nthey are\npart of the\ns o c i e t y\nand that\nthey are\nnot for-saken.\nA:Thehomelessneedtofeelliketheir\ncircumstances are being understood in\ntheir entirety.\nAre there any improvements charities\ncan make to tackle this issue better?\nSarah (coordinator for\nSoupRun 22/23): A social worker\nonce mentioned that most homeless\npeople have believed that modern society is hostile to them after struggling\nin lower class for years. Therefore, they\nhave rejected going back to it even if\nthey have a chance. I think this mentality is one of the underlying reasons for\ntheir unemployment, which needs to be\ntackled with patience.\nA: I think it\u2019s important to constantly\nevaluate whether we\u2019re truly impacting\npeople\u2019s lives with the voluntary work\nwe do. Providing food is a very sensible\nshort term solution but will not solve\nthe homelessness issue in the long run.\nI think charities should focus on trying\nto prevent homelessness in the first place\nand if that\u2019s not possible, they should\nfocus on trying to provide people with\nthe mentorship and support they need\nto get back on their feet. Of course, this\nis much easier said than done as it involves much higher costs and the need\nfor skilled people.\nTherefore, we are inviting you to join\nus! In the coming academic year, we will\nhold petitions for policy change, share\ntips and facts, provide information for\nvolunteering as a skilled mentor as well\nas serving food, hygienic products, sanitary products (and maybe beauty productstomakesomeone\u2019sday!).Staytuned\nby following Instagram @icsouprun!\nVolunteering with IC Soup Run\nImperial College Soup Run interviews volunteers to find out why they give their time\nWHETHER WE\u2019RE\nTRULYIMPACTING\nPEOPLE\u2019S LIVES\n\u201c\nIC Soup Run spreading holiday cheer\nPhoto credits: IC Soup Run\nA BIG ISSUE AND\nIT\u2019S HARD TO\nIGNORE IT...\nLEARN WHAT\nTHEIR LIVES ARE\nLIKE\n\u201c\nPreparing a bit of entertainment...\nPhoto credits: IC Soup Run\nICSoupRun\nCommittee\nJoin IC Soup Run\n\n"

    "content": "When I first saw the designs for\nALERT, I genuinely didn\u2019t believe it was real. The idea that real life\nmembers of the bureaucracy could genuinely want or even approve such a comically phallic statue seemed too funny to\nbe true. That amusement has now been\nreplaced by anger, after seeing Antony\nGormley\u2019s proposed statue in tribute to\nAlan Turing, in Cambridge. It turned\nout the statues\u2019 concepts come from a\nline of sculptures called Cast Slabworks,\nall following the motif of \u201cHumans but\nmade of cuboids\u201d. My anger spews forth\nfrom two factors: artistic and moral.\nI myself am an artist by trade, and this\nline of sculptures is basically just a technical exercise, in the same vein of making a drawing without lifting your pen\noff the paper. Figure Drawing Methods\nfor Artists, by Boerboom and Proetel,\nis an excellent book full of suggestions\nfor these kinds of studies. The Tangram\npuzzle game utilises a style very similar to Gormley\u2019s to produce all manner\nof images. This is not to disparage the\nsculptures; they make for quite an effective physical exhibition when viewed\none after the other in ensemble. But each\nindividually has little value as a standalone piece, much as a single musical\nnote is quite boring when removed from\nits parent melody. And yet, one of these\nis what\u2019s being given to the commemoration of Alan Turing. Compare Imperial\u2019s\nmost important statue: that of Queen\nVictoria in the entrance space. There is\nno pretentious attempt to make an abstract statement of any kind, the statue is\nan expertly made rendition of the monarch most associated with the university and the neighbouring museums. Imagine how much more engaging for the\naverage person it is to see a realistic statue of an icon, look at the statue from different angles almost imagining that you\nare looking upon the real person, feel the\nreality that this person existed and influenced the course of history\u2026 and now\nconsider what will actually be available\nto Cambridge students: looking at some\ncuboids that you are told represent the\nfigure. From an artistic perspective, it really is quite lazy. From an audience per-spective, it is needlessly \u2018artsy\u2019. Just make\na statue that looks like the guy.\nMoving beyond art, however, the\ngreatest point of anger for me now directed towards Antony Gormley is how\nmuch of an actual insult to Alan Turing\nit is to offer what he has offered in the\nway of a commemorative statue. Ignoring my bias against abstract art, it cannot even be argued that the statue was in\nany way inspired by Alan Turing; there\nare scores more statues indistinguishable\nfrom it from the rest of Cast Slabworks;\nALERT could easily have been offered\nin its place. Some argue that its problem\nis that it clashes with the aesthetic of the\nCambridge grounds, when in reality the\nproblem is that it is the equivalent of being asked to paint Charles Babbage and\njustpickingoutanalreadydrawnsheetof\nsomething unrelated from your sketch-book. What is being erected in truth is\nan Antony Gormley statue, in place of\nan Alan Turing one. This wouldn\u2019t be\na problem if the statue were part of an\nAntony Gormley exhibition, as it would\nnecessarilybeanexperiencededicatedto\nAntony Gormley. But a statue in a public space, in principle dedicated wholly\nto the figure? The only truly respectful\nstyle is realistic, like the aforementioned\nQueen Victoria, made by a trade sculptor not overly-concerned with making a\nname as a statement artist.\nFor the sake of momentary clarity, I\nhave directed my anger towards Antony\nGormley. I should make it clear that perhaps the real rage should be felt towards\nwhoever commissioned him for the\nAlan Turing statue. Obviously Antony\nGormley would both use an unnecessarily abstract style from his own portfolio\nand impose his personality on a statue\ndedicated to a historical icon. He\u2019s Antony Gormley. If you wanted a more\nconventional and respectful tribute, you\nwould simply commision a skilled but\nconventional sculptor. So why didn\u2019t\nthey? Is Alan Turing\u2019s name so worthless\nthat it must be propped up by a famous\nsculptor? Is Antony Gormley so much\nmore desperate for employment than\ntrade sculptors? Truly, some people cannot be trusted to spend money wisely.\nHowever, we cannot grant Gormley any\nleniency for not identifying the massive\nerection in ALERT, that\u2019s all on him.\nFRIDAY 30TH SEPTEMBER 2022\n9\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment > IC Soup Run\nWhat they do, and why they do it\nHow should a statue look?\nGormley faces further criticism as University of Cambridge statue of Alan Turing is revealed, aptly named...

    "content": "O\nn Friday 26th November 2021,\nFelix first reported on the now-infamous ALERT statue, running the\nheadline \u201cDongoor Plaza \u2013 Imperial\nCollege lawn re-opens as statue plans\nseen\u201d. Since then, the statue has become\nthe source of much controversy as a\nconsequence of the 2m appendage\nprotruding out of its lower torso, which\nmany have interpreted as its penis.\nThe artist, acclaimed British sculptor\nSir Antony Gormley, has denied this.\nIn an interview with The Times on 7th\nAugust this year, he praised students for\nquestioning \u201cthe decisions and context\nin which they are working\u201d. However, he\nargued that \u201ctheir objection is founded on\na misinterpretation\u201d, calling it the \u201csign of an\noveractive imagination\u201d. Sir Gormley claims\nthat the figure is \u201csquatting on its haunches\nand surveying the world around it\u201d.\nCalmbeforethestorm\nThe first mention of ALERT appeared\non 2nd\nAugust 2021 on the College website\nas part of an article on the long-term\nredevelopment of the South Kensington\ncampus. The article is accompanied by a\n3D render of the statue taken from behind.\nConspicuously missing from this image are\nwhat in Gormley\u2019s interpretation might\nbe considered the \u201cknees\u201d, a point which\nImperial College Union Council would\nlater draw attention to.\nOn 10th\nAugust 2021, the College\nsubmitted a planning application for the\nstatue, under the title \u2018Installation of a\nnew public art feature and public realm\nimprovements\u201d. Felix understands that\nsenior College staff saw and approved the\nplans. Amongst the 27 documents included\nwas the innocuously titled \u201cDesign and\nAccess Statement\u201d, containing the now-infamousrendersoftheALERTstatue.One\nastute observer submitted an objection to\nthe application on 23rd\nAugust, noting that\n\u201cthe design of the sculpture seems to me to\nresemble a man with an erect phallus\u201d. Aside\nfrom this, however, there appears to have\nbeen little knowledge of the statue outside\nof College circles.\nThree months later, on 26th\nNovember,\nFelix found the renders whilst looking\nthroughtheCollege\u2019splanningapplications.\nA picture of the statue was splashed across\nthefrontpageofthepaper,bringingALERT\nin all its glory to the general public.\nUnionhasitssay\nControversy soon followed, and on 11th\nJanuary 2022, the Union Council passed a\nproposal to lobby against the installation\nof the statue, with 29 out of 32 council\nmembers voting in favour. It argued that\nstudents should have been consulted on\nthe installation. The Union paper, seen by\nFelix, raised concerns about the potentially\n\u201cphallic interpretation\u201d of ALERT\u2019s form.\nThe statue was described as \u201cexclusionary\u201d\ngiven the College\u2019s \u201cissues with gender ratio\nand inclusion\u201d. A figure was produced to\naccompany the motion, explicitly indicating\nthe alternative interpretation.

This means that\nresearch and data held by Chinese\ncompanies can be accessed by the\nCCP and the PLA whenever it is\ndeemed necessary.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n29 Sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nThe first few months of the year are\nalways the busiest in a dancer\u2019s cal-endar. Three of the four major competitions of the year are scheduled during\none hectic month between the end of\nJanuary and the end of February, culminating to the biggest UK university\ndance competition of the year - Inter\nVarsity Dance Competition (IVDC) -held at Blackpool\u2019s Winter Gardens.\nComing off of highly successful appearances at the University of East Anglia friendly and the Southern Universities Dance Competition, the Imperial\nCollege Dance Club was in the best possible shape to succeed.\nThe weekend fun started on Friday\nwith a Blackpool Coach Trip Quiz\nwhere GCSE science, Disney song\nknowledge and Alistair\u2019s French accent\nwere put to the ultimate test. Then Saturday began early. Most were putting the\nfinishing touches to their hair and make-up, whilst others followed their strict\npre-competition shower rota and others\npracticed their Ballroom frame in the\nmirror for two hours.\nUpon arriving at the\nEmpress Ballroom in the\nWinter Gardens, it\u2019s easy\nto be intimidated by the\nsheer size and grandi-osity of the dance floor.\nHowever, such a dance\nfloor is necessary, as several hundred dancers\nfrom all across the country were in attendance.\nThe day began with\nthe Ballroom rounds\nwhere presentation, pre-cision, posture and poise\nare key. Considering most people had\nhad maybe only four hours of sleep the\nnight before, the morning proved to be\nfruitful for Imperial, with eleven couples\nmaking a final, and many more making a\nsemi-final. Big shout-out to Jake Woolley and Alys Dally who, out of almost\n150 couples, came first in the Beginners\nQuickstep event.\nIn the afternoon, the Latin rounds\nbegan where showmanship, syncopa-tion, sharpness and style are all essential.\nBy the time finals came around, some\npeople had\nbeen dancing solidly\nfor nearly\nnine hours!\nDespite this,\nten couples\nqualified for\ntheir respective finals,\nand again,\nmany more\nmade it to\nthe semis.\nLewis Ng\nand Momo Chen won the Pre-Intermediate competition by Cha Cha Cha-ing\nand Jiving their way to victory!\nThe whole Dance Club can be very\nproud in placing at least one finalist in\nfifteen of the twenty available individual events; Ben Biggs and Zo\u00eb McGee\nshould be particularly proud as they\nwere one of only two couples to make\nAdvanced finals in both Ballroom and\nLatin, solidifying themselves as Imperial\u2019s leading 10-Dance couple!\nBut, if the last few years have proven\nanything, it\u2019s that the ICDC is much\nstronger as a team. Evidence for this can\nsimply be found by the sheer exuberance\nwith which Imperial\u2019s dancers cheer\nfor and support those out on the floor;\nwe really turn the volume up to eleven!\nThere is surely not a stronger team spirit\nto be found at any other university.\nThe Team Match \u2013 where universities\ngo head to head \u2013 is where Imperial truly shines, and this isn\u2019t a new phenome-non; in fact, throughout the 90s, Imperial won seven team matches, including\nfour consecutive wins.\nPut simply, the Team Match is where\nthe team captain creates a team using\nfour couples. Each couple competes in\none dance: Waltz, Cha Cha Cha, Quickstep and Jive \u2013 the four cornerstones of\nBallroom and Latin. Their scores are\ncombined, and the team with the best\noverall score wins. There is both a student Team Match and an ex-student\nTeam Match.\nThe student Team Match is split into\ntwo divisions. Imperial\u2019s A, B and C\nteams all qualified for Division 1, with\nTeam A making the final after four high-lycompetitiverounds.Noteventhelikes\nof Cambridge (IC\u2019s arch-rivals) could\nknock Imperial out of step as Team A\nscored half as many points (the lowest\nscore wins in Team Match) as the next\nbest team. It was an outstanding, yet unsurprising (humble IC brag!) achievement considering the talent each of the\nfour couples has out on the dance floor.\nThe Ex-Student Team Match is slightly easier to describe; no divisions, simply\na quarter-final, a semi-final and a final.\nIC Dance Club Triumph in Blackpool\nIC Dance Club\nCommittee\nEdited by: Amanda Barden\nKonrad Hohendorf\nSport\nThe Imperial College Dance Club celebrating their various triumphs in the Winter Gardens\u2019\n\u201c\nIT\u2019S EASY TO BE\nINTIMIDATED BY\nTHE SHEER SIZE\nAND GRANDIOSITY\nOF THE DANCE\nFLOOR\n\u201c\nSOME PEOPLE\nWERE\nDANCING\nSOLIDLY FOR\nNEARLY NINE\nHOURS!\nCredit: IC Dance Club\n\n"

    "content": "The Garden has always been \u2018weird\u2019. In my\nmind, I associate them with modern art galler-ies, where you spend ten minutes looking at a single\nsculpture not because of the technicality presented,\nbut because you are trying to decipher its meaning.\nAnd in a way, a large part of the art punk genre, their\nprimary outlet, works in this way. There is an antithetical combination of rudimentary punk rock with\nsophisticated elements brought from, quite literally,\nanywhere else. Horseshit on Route 66 samples media\nthat ranges from the 1955 musical-comedy The Court\nJester, to the YouTuber Jacksepticeye, all the while\npromenading on soundscapes reminiscent of surf rock\nto digital hardcore. Wyatt and Fletcher Shears, the\ntwins who form The Garden, manage to make order\nout of this chaos with the\nnew record, something they\nhave often struggled with in\nthe past. Indeed, that was\ntheir biggest sin in previous\nprojects, often being classified as \u2018inconsistent\u2019 by critics and music fans. And that\nflaw is completely gone here.\nCompacting the track list\nto 11 songs spanning across\njust 24 minutes, the duo gets\nstraight to the point, not\nspending energy on empty,\ncryptic tracks which often\nbloated previous albums, but making meaning out of\ndisorder.\nAs I said before, Horseshit on Route 66 does not\ncut any corners. It starts with the simple yet effective\ntrack \u2018Haunted House on Zillow\u2019, a tongue-in-cheek\nhorror song about a ghost-ridden property listed for\nsale on the Zillow online marketplace, a theme that\nhas generated countless Buzzfeed-style articles and\ndedicated Instagram pages. This kind of Generation Z\nhumour is present all throughout the following tracks,\nwhether it is with the absurdism of the scenarios\npainted, or with references to pop culture, such as\nthe somehow Oscar-less stop-motion film Chicken\nRun (in which a 5-year-old Wyatt voiced the ever so\nfamous Additional Chicken).\nThe album is short, yes, but it covers plenty of\nground. Be it with the devouring \u2018Puerta de Limosina\u2019,\nan injection of adrenaline to the head, or with\n\u2018ChainsawtheDoor\u2019,amotivationalspeechonstepping\ninto the unknown, there is a common backdrop of\npunk, a DIY magic that glues everything together.\nThe track that represents this concept the best must be\nthe climax of the project, \u2018Orange County Punk Rock\nLegend\u2019, an ode to the dark side of being backstage, as\nin the ominous experiences that artists are submitted\nto by simply having a presence in the scene. It has a\nsweet guitar melody but borderline disgusting lyrics\n\u2013 sonically a cute homage to the twins\u2019 hometown, it\nis in reality a joke about the horseshit they have dealt\nwith.\nThis naked punk-ness with which The Garden\npresents themselves is what make the whole thing so\ninteresting to me. In a way it\nrepresents the dissatisfactions\nof the modern youth for\nwhat they are, without any\npretentiousness or whininess;\nit being the downfall of\nthe American Dream; the\ncreeping urban violence\npresent in any city or the\nstruggle to maintain privacy\nin an online world. The gritty\nbass tone coupled with the\ndelicate guitar riffs make up\nfor an improbable bunch\nof songs, especially when\nyou add a layer of drum\nand bass elements and lo-fi production. It is almost like having a bag of those\nmystery jellybeans: some are nice, some stink, however\nthey all work together to put the consumption\nexperience over the actual flavour. Don\u2019t get me\nwrong, I am saying that \u2018Squished Face Slick Pig Living\nin a Smokey City\u2019 sounds absolutely ugly, and it just\u2026\nworks.

    "content": "Transformer begins with \u2018It is the movement that\ncreates the form\u2019 and with that, Nick Lane sums\nup his entire thesis. To best understand the origin of\nlife, as well as where life falters, we must not underestimate the central importance of metabolism \u2013 and especially the Krebs cycle.\nLane journeys through the discovery of the Krebs\ncycle and enlivens the narrative with stories of scientists who\u2019ve cast long shadows across their respective\nfields. He gradually develops\nthe picture with descriptions\nof discoveries and findings that\nultimately led to the complete\ncycle. The author indulges in\naffectionate metaphors and chemical representations of molecules\nthat aim to ease the lay-reader\ninto textbook biochemistry. While this slightly dulls\nthe presented ideas for more technical readers, it is a\nminor flaw.\nAs far as over-simplifications go, according to\nLane, none are as harmful to the subject as the dogma\nsurrounding respiration and photosynthesis. Plants\nmake glucose, which animals then oxidise to create\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP), an energy carrier. It\u2019s a\nproblem that goes unnoticed unless pointed out, but\nit is certainly there. There is more to the Krebs cycle\nthan simply energy production \u2013 it constantly changes\nand directs metabolic flux within cells. It fits in with\nthe information-obsessed era of biology we\u2019re currently in that tends to overshadow the dynamic side of\nbiochemistry.\nWith this knowledge now in place, Lane delves into\nthe greatest mystery of all \u2013 the origin of life. Without\ngiving too much away, Lane\u2019s interpretation involves\nhydrothermal vents, catalytic\nminerals, and a complete reversal\nof the modern-day Krebs cycle. It\nis a fascinating look into how living\ncells may have originated from\nsimple chemical beginnings. The\nlater chapters on cancer, ageing, and\nconsciousness are equally intriguing\n\u2013 but I leave it to the reader\u2019s discretion to dig deeper\ninto these concepts.\nLane\u2019s style is easy to read, and unintimidating \u2013 at\ntimes too much so. Whilst I\u2019d like to say the book is\naccessible to anyone, I would advise that someone\nwith a biology-related background would find it\nmore easily digestible. Regardless, Transformer is an\nexcellent book and a worthwhile read, particularly for\nthose interested in biology and biochemistry.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nBooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n26\nTransformer: The Deep Chemistry of Life\nand Death\nBook Review\nKieron Cartwright Books Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n\u201c\nINDULGES IN\nAFFECTIONATE\nMETAPHORS ...\nHello.

She\nhas also been on Union Council for three\nyears and served as Faculty Rep for Engineering.\nCampaign Goals\nWong ran a campaign based around removing \u201cbureaucracy\u201d, and is aiming to\nreview the Constituent Union (CU) structure. She is reviewing complaints\nand disciplinary procedures, and wants to implement a code of conduct for\nCSP culture and improve Union admin and finance procedures for students.\nNiamh McAuley\nDeputy President\n(Finance and Services)\nNiamh McAuley is your Deputy President\nfor Finances and Services. She brings wth\nher three years of experience at Beit Bars\n(FiveSixEight, Metric and the Union Bar)\nand has served as Chair of the Arts &\nEntertainments Management Group, which\nrepresents Arts and Ents clubs.\nCampaign Goals\nMcAuley ran on a platform of diversifying Union events and reducing response\ntimes from the Union to clubs and societies. Specific goals on her manifesto\ninclude increasing events for underrepresented groups and the implementation of\na post-grad welcome week. She also aimed to work with College campus services\nto expand the range of food available. McAuley has already delivered on some of\nher pledges; Postgrad Night starts on 30th\nSeptember, promising \u201cthe cheapest\ndrinks in South Ken\u201d, followed by Postgrad Pies, Postgrad Prosecco and Postgrad\nPilates.

Particularly noteworthy is his goal to\n\u201cautomate the management of union tasks\u201d to allow the Union to handle\nrequests from CSPs more quickly. His manifesto also states aims to\nimprove the transparency of financial decisions and to develop a system\nto allow CSPs to use the union to find sponsors. Aside from this, his\nmanifesto expresses an aim to \u201chelp introduce a clear path to net zero for\nthe union\u201d and \u201csupport clubs in reducing their carbon footprint\u201d.\nWHAT DO THEY ACTUALLY DO?\nExpect more on this from Felix in an upcoming\nissue, where we plan to explain what the Union as\na whole does, but for now, here it is in the Union\u2019s\nown words:\n\u201cThe Union is led by the Officer Trustees who are elected every year\nin our Leadership Elections in a cross-campus ballot. They take a year\nout of their studies and work full-time, making your Union and Imperial even better. Our elections achieve one of the highest turn outs\nof any Students\u2019 Union election in the UK and you can get involved\nwith the Leadership Elections every March.\u201d\n\u201cYour Officer Trustees are here to improve the student voice for all\nstudents at Imperial. They represent you to College on issues such as\nyour course, department and faculty as well as any other problems\nyou may have during your time at Imperial. They are here to make\nyour time at Imperial even better and to ensure you have the best\npossible experience both during your studies and personal life.

But\nafternoons at the garden would not be as\nfun without the company of other Environmental Society members.\nStudents join Environmental Society\nfor a variety of reasons. Some students\nwant a career in sustainability and enjoy the EcoCareers talks taking place\nroughly once per term. Some students\nhave grown up around nature and attend gardening sessions to meet other\nplant lovers. In contrast, some students\nhave grown up in concrete jungles and\nvisit the Secret Garden to escape from\nbustling Central London. Most student\napiarists had zero beekeeping experience\nbefore joining Environmental Societythey wanted to try something new and\nchallenging. This year, the committee\nseeks students with innovative campaign\nideas on how to make the College more\nsustainable.\nBut what connects all Environmental Society members is a love for nature.\nWhen a toad or snail is discovered in\nthe Secret Garden grass, there is likely\nsomeone there who knows an obscure\nfact about the animal. Plants are talked\nabout a lot while gardening, be it those\nin the garden or houseplants. Similarly,\nbeekeeping sessions are filled with fascinating bee facts.\nStudents love discussing the roles,\nskills, and social\nstructure of bees\nwhile inspecting the hives. The\nhead beekeeper\nhas an answer to all\nbee-related ques-tions, which is especially remarkable\nbecause he is self-taught. Learning\nabout apiculture\nwas his lockdown\nproject while more\nexperienced student beekeepers\nwere stuck in their\nhome countries.\nIt is therefore no\nsurprise that most\nEnvironmental Society members study\nBiological Sciences. The Secret Garden\nis the perfect place for biology students\nto get advice on next year\u2019s modules,\ncareers, internships and more. But students also love meeting people from\nother courses while gardening, like any\nother society. As well as departmentally\ndiverse, the Secret Garden is a culturally diverse place - often students have to\nlook up what a plant\u2019s English name is\nbecause they only know it in their mother tongue. While doing mundane tasks\nlike raking leaves or painting the fence,\nit is nice for students to be able to chat\nabout where they\u2019re from or interests\nother than the environment. Art galler-ies, Spanish literature, the neurological\neffect of drugs... the Secret Garden fence\nhas heard it all. But every so often, when\nan ant is accidentally smothered with\npaint or a bee does something interesting during inspection, the conversation\nsways back to nature. So after two hours\nof hard work, gardeners and beekeepers\nleave the Secret Garden with a reinvig-orated appreciation for the plants and\nanimals we share a planet with.\nIf these feature articles have interested readers in becoming a gardener or\nbeekeeper, the joining process is easy.\nFirst, students pay a negligible Environmental Society membership fee and\njoin the WhatsApp group. There is no\nfurther registration required for garden-ing; students just need to show up at the\nSecret Garden on a Wednesday at 2pm\nand they will usually be let in. Beekeepers need to sign up for each session on\na form sent via WhatsApp, with most\nsessions taking place on Saturdays 1pm-3pm. Members can attend as many or as\nfew sessions as they want, but Environmental Society hopes to welcome more\nregular members to the garden this academic year!\nScan the QR code to join IC\nEnvironmental Soc\nIC Environmental Society\u2019s Secret Garden\nIC Environmental Society\u2019s Secret Garden\nSimran Patel Environmental Soc Treasurer\nImage Credit: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London\nImage Credit: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London\n\n"

    "content": "Upon entering Imperial\u2019s Secret\nGarden from the back entrance,\nvisitors are greeted with a faint smell of\nhoney. For hiding amidst the peas and\npotatoes is a hive of honeybees that Imperial College Environmental Society\nare delighted to call their own. After a\nfailed attempt to take care of three hives\nat once, this hive has received the society\u2019s undivided attention over the last\nacademic year. And their attention has\npaid off.\nIn early June, students found that a\nnew queen was being reared in their\nhive. When a hive naturally has a new\nqueen,theoldqueenandpartofthehive\nleave in a process called swarming. Environmental Society simulated this process and created an artificial swarm. One\nstudent held up the frames from the\nmain hive, and another brushed some\nof the bees and their old queen into a\nsmaller nucleus hive. It took bravery to\nforcefully evict dozens of bees from their\nhomes, as they buzzed loudly and flew\naround dangerously close to jumping\ninto the students\u2019 suits. But the students\nremained calm, and the nucleus hive was\ncreated without anyone getting hurt. In\nfact, the head apiarist takes pride in the\nfact that no one has been stung over the\nlastacademicyear.Hecallsthishivemost\ndocile he has ever dealt with, so even students who have never been around bees\nbefore can become comfortable around\nit. Wearing the correct equipment and\ndressing appropriately for sessions has\nmade students even more comfortable.\nBeekeeping sessions take place every\nSaturday. Over summer this mainly involved checking on the nucleus hive,\nbecause the main hive was left alone to\nallow the new queen space and time to\ngrow. To check on the nucleus hive, each\nof the five frames are carefully raised,\nboth sides inspected, and lowered again.\nThis can be a squeamish process for\nnewbies. Frames are overcrowded with\nwiggling bees, some of which crawl over\nthe top to the other side of the frame.\nHeavy with nectar and honeycomb,\nsome frames need skill to hold up. But\ninspection is a simple process after this.\nThe frames are checked for the presence\nof the old queen, who was marked with\na white spot on the head when the hive\nfirst arrived at the garden. Another thing\nbeing looked out for is whether nectar\nreserves are healthy; bees in the Secret\nGarden collect nectar from Prince\u2019s Gardens and the fringe of Hyde Park. Occasionally students have spotted worker\nbees bringing back colourful nectar on\ntheir hind legs, a surprisingly adorable\nsight. Many cells are filled with chubby\nlarvae, who are raised by their sisters to\neventually join them.\nButensuringtheselarvaehaveafuture\nin the Secret Garden requires dedication from student apiarists through the\nautumn. Preparation for the winter is\ncrucial, especially because winter killed\nEnvironmental Society\u2019s last three hives.\nFor example, male bees (drones) need to\nbe removed from the hive because they\nserve no purpose over winter and drain\nresources. Above all, Environmental\nSociety is looking for an heir to the current Head Apiarist. With so much work\nneeding to be done, there is no better\ntime than now to become an Environmental Society beekeeper!\nFRIDAY 30TH SEPTEMBER 2022\n12 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: marie mori\nEnvironment\nIC Environmental Society\u2019s Secret\nGarden Part 2\nSimran Patel Environmental Soc Treasurer\nThe main hive (right) and nucleus hive (left) in\nthe Secret Garden.\nImage Credit: Heiloi Yip\nBEEKEEPING\nSESSIONS TAKE\nPLACE EVERY\nSATURDAY.\n\u201c\nScan the QR code for Part 1!\nImage Credit: Simran Patel\nIC Environmental Society\u2019s Secret Garden\nImage Credit: Thomas Angus/Imperial College London\nDo you like what\nyou see in the Environment sec-tion?
