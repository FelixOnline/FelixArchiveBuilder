    "content": "Curve: Interview MLSIC\nCorr, a bit of luck\nand a smile can\nget you anywhere.\nAfter the Boo's interview at ULU\nDominic went\nhome (prior\nengagement, 36-24-36) and I went\nfishing for the ever\nso lovely Curve\npeople, hoping I might steal the\nodd few minutes\nwith pop's new\nkids on the block.\nAnd what do you\nknow, Santa\nClause does exist\nafter all etc...\nSo tell me Tony (-yes, it was HER. I had Tony to my very own little self!!)\nall there is to know about Curve SVP.\nWell, we are a band of 5 individuals, all\ncompletely different and it's exciting.\nAre the upper echelons of the charts\nyour one true goal?\nToo fucking right (eek t).I can't really see\nit happening unless there's a dramatic\nchange in the approach in the way\npeople accept music in this country. But\nmay be it will be like that, its difficult to\nsay. All the bands in this country that I really love aren't successful...there's no\nneed for it. What they're doing is actually\nnew...which is a drawback.\nSo the music you make is solely for\nyourself?\nI don't think you can make music for\nanyone else. Most musicians do it to cure\ntheir own frustrations.\nHas critical success altered the you as\na person?\nOh no, not yet, it obviously hasn't done\nyet. You have ideals, but its a myth that\nyou don't change especially with the\npressure you are under, you'd be fucking\ninsane if you didn't change. Morally and\nfundamentally they are using us, and so\nwe are in it for all we can get.\nWe've had to cope with so much shit.\nAfter our first gig a young kid came up\nto me and said, \"You're fucking crap. If\nthat's your first gig, how did you get in\nfucking Melody Maker\". Obviously we\nwere upset, but this kind of thing does\nmake you change. But this is nothing,\nbecause we are just at the beginning. We\nare like little puppies growing (ahh, so\nsweet). We are really excited by\neverything and enjoying ourselves at the\nmoment.\nHow do you feel about your\nrecordings so far?\nWe obviously want people to like our\nrecords, but we just put it out because we\nliked it.\nThere's a good possibility of the new\nsingle charting, did you plan on\nsuccess so soon?\nNo, I still don't think that will happen. I never believe anything until I see it. I can't really think any other way. You\nnever really think about it before hand.\nYou can't really. This is what I want to\ndo. We were on SnubTV the other week\nand I really loved it.\nCan you make money out of what you\nare doing?\nYes, you can, because we have a record\ndeal, but you don't make money out of\nthe records. We get a cash advance from\nthe record deal, but we don't get any\nmoney from the actual records. If we\ndon't sell any records, then obviously\nthey'll (Anxious) drop us, but if we do sell\nrecords then you can make a lot of\nmoney. We don't make money from tours\nat all. Not at this level, but it does raise\nyour profile and mainly because we want\nto do it anyway. The record company are\ngood about us wanting to support bands\nand when we want to go in the studio.\nThen I couldn't resist, the sinful,\nsinful clicked question. Influences?\nYo the mc5( just kidding, Dominic was\ninsist ant), the band listen to Stones (big\nfan) , Lenny Cohen (cool dude) and\nanything to do with Punk. I 've always\nbeen mad about music, I 've always\nwanted to be a singer. I feel very lucky\nbecause I'm doing what I want to do.\n\n"

    "content": "Ambulance Theft strike?\nThe Imperial College Ambulance which was broken into\nThe Imperial College Ambulance was\nbroken into last week and approximately\n\u00a3500 of emergency equipment was stolen.\nAmongst the articles were several gas\ncylinders, two containing nitrous oxide\n(laughing gas) and an ent in ox unit, used\nto administer the gas to patients in severe\npain.\nThe gas creates a high and, since the\nent in ox unit was taken rather than other\nmore valuable equipment, the red cross\nbelieve that it was taken for personal use\nrather than sale on the black market.\nSecurity are connecting the theft with the\nfind of an empty Nitrous Oxide Cylinder\nin Beit Quad two weeks ago.\nThe police have been called in to solve\nthe crime, but no progress has been\nmade as of yet. To prevent further thefts,\nthe ambulance, situated outside the\nSherfield building is to be fitted with a car alarm which will sound upon any\nunauthorised entry.\nRoger Serpell, Head of the Imperial\nCollege Red Cross Service, is asking\nanybody who knows of the theft to\nreturn the articles anonymously, as they\nare an important part of the ambulance's equipment.\nSecurity recommends that anybody\nusing Nitrous Oxide should go the see the\nHealth Centre to talk about Medical\nConsequences of persistent use.\nPillage\nThefts were reported yesterday in\nFalmouth Keogh and Tizard Halls when\nunlocked rooms were looted for money\nand valuables.\nDr John Hassard, warden of Selkirk and\nTizard Halls informed Felix that two\nstudents in Falmouth Keogh had lost \u00a350\nand \u00a360 respectively, and that at least\ntwo Tizard residents had been robbed.\nSince there was no evidence of forced\nentry, there is little likelihood of a successful insurance claim.\nUndergraduate places might be reduced\nnext year, when College closes Fisher\nHall's single rooms to all but 51 week\nrents. This will mean that anyone not\nwishing to stay in London over the entire\nsummer will not be able to afford to live\nthere, effectively leaving the places open\nonly to postgraduates, and some foreign\nstudents.\nFisher Hall's, Southside's, Linstead's and\nWeeks' single rooms are to rise in rent\nfrom \u00a346 to \u00a352 per week. In addition to\nthis, a hidden price rise has also been\nincluded. This takes the form of\ncompulsory Christmas leasing. From next\nyear, all students in College rooms will\nhave to pay rent for the whole of the\nChristmas vacation, regardless of whether\nthey are staying in London, or whether\nthey will be storing luggage in their\nrooms. This gives an effective 9% rent\nincrease, making total effective rise of\nover 20%.\nOther increases include a rise in\ndeposits form \u00a350 to \u00a375, and the notice\nwhich must be given to quit a room will\nbe increased to one term, making it more\ndifficult to move out of a College room.\nUnion President, Paul Shapley,\ndescribed the changes as 'terrible',\ncommenting that it had been seventeen\nyears since the last campus-wide rent\nstrike.\nHot Air\nImperial College may be about to change\nits suppliers of industrial gases. In the\ncoming week Mr Greaves, Imperial\nCollege's Purchasing Officer, will be\nmeeting with its present suppliers, British\nOxygen Company (BOC), and rival\ncompany, Air Products Limited.\nAt present Imperial provides 10% of the\ntotal academic market for gases, but still\npays the same rate charged by BOC to\nother smaller consumers. Mr Greaves said\nthat he did want to 'prop up other\nUniversities' and that the savings made\nby changing supplier would more than\njustify any administrative difficulties\nincurred.\nMr Greaves said that the move was not\nyet definite, as BOC might drop their\nprices to keep the custom of Imperial\nCollege, due to the possibility that our\nmove might cause a domino effect\nthrough other Universities. He said that\nthe decision was part of a 'general\nrestructuring of College Finances during a recession period'.\n\n"

    "content": "Golf\nCLUBS\nFor all you golf fanatics out there, who\nalways watch it on TV and have always\nwondered how to go about taking it up, 1\nwent and talked to Andrew Reason,\nchairman of the IC Golf Club, to find out\nmore about the sport.\nBefore anyone can play golf, you need\na set of golf clubs and proper attire. This\nmeans jeans, trainers and Iron Maiden Tshirts have to be replaced by golf shoes,\ntrousers and snazzy jumpers. As for the\ngolf clubs, you are allowed a maximum\nof 14 which may consist of 3 woods, 10\nirons and a putter. A new set of clubs can\ncost as much as \u00a31000, but novices are\nencouraged to buy second hand sets\nwhich cost a mere \u00a3200-\u00a3300!\nOnce you have the equipment, you\nneed somewhere to play. There are\nplenty of golf clubs around London, but\nwith only one drawback - the\nmembership fee. For your first year with\na club, you can be expected to pay \u00a31500\nor more, but from then on this drops to\naround \u00a3500-\u00a3800. However, if you are a member of the IC Golf Club, the cost to\nyou would only be \u00a335 - the membership\nfee of the club. This is because the IC\nclub is an affiliated member of Sudbury\nGolf Club, thus allowing all its members\nto also be affiliated members. The only\ncatch is that you still have to pay \u00a315 for\neach round of 18 holes you play.\nHowever, the IC Union has kindly agreed\nto sub sid is e this cost so long as a receipt,\nsigned by the Sudbury secretary, is\nprovided as proof.\nNow that you have organised a place to\nplay, you need to find out how good you\nare and get ranked accordingly. This is\ndone by averaging the scores for your\nfirst 5 rounds of 18 holes, with the\nresulting number then referred to as your\nhandicap. The professionals have\nhandicaps of less than 1, good amateurs\n2-9 and those who just play every once in\na while have handicaps above 20. Once\nyou have been given a handicap, by\npractising and playing more golf you can\nbring it down. For each stroke that you\nimprove by, your handicap decreases by\n0.2 approximately.\nNovices of golf can also improve their\ngame with the help of coaching. The club\nhas made an arrangement with some of\nthe Sudbury Club professionals to provide\ncoaching sessions for its members. For \u00a33\nyou can go out with a group of 6 and get\ncoached for half an hour. This compares\nwith paying anything upwards of \u00a320 for\nthe same lesson, if you tried to find\ncoaching for yourself.\nThe IC club itself take an active part in\nstudent golf events organised both within\nthe UK and abroad. Recently, a team of\nthree played in a4 day tournament in\nDeauville, France, for the top 50\nuniversity teams in Europe. They were\nAndrew Reason (handicap 5), Robin Keyte\n(8) and Simon Roper (4), and they\n12\n\n"

    "content": "l. NION\nUnion Page\nBenjamin Turner, ICU DP1. Careers Service\nBoard of Studies has now been notified of\nthe impending transition of the Careers\nService, following the decision of the non-policy making Management Planning\nGroup to d is affiliate from the University\nof London Careers Advisory Service\n(ULCAS).\nAt the recent meeting of the Careers\nAdvisors Committee, the first since the\ndecision to d is affiliate was taken, several\nuseful suggestions were forthcoming from\nthe ULCAS Careers Advisors concerning,\namong other things, the technique that\ncould be used to select the future\nDirector of the Careers Service.\nRuss Clark, present Director of the\nCareers Service, and the other ULCAS\ncareers advisors currently with the\nImperial College service, will depart\nduring July this summer.\nIndications are that Kings College and\nother colleges of University of London\nare also investigating d is affiliation from\nthe central service. One of the strong\narguments in the debate here for\nd is affiliating is that the Imperial College\nservice could now buy back into those\nservices at ULCAS that it will not be able\nto provide effectively. It would be a shame if so many colleges d is affiliated that ULCAS either ceases to be, or\nbecomes a very different, skeletal\norganisation that loses its strengths and\ntherefore is not be able to provide the\nsame level of service.\nOne worry for students at Imperial\nCollege must be that certain costs might\nnow be passed onto students. In this\nrespect, I would draw your attention to\nthe factual (as opposed to opinion)\nelements of Andy Butcher's Editorial of\n3rd May, 1991, which voices this concern\nthat Imperial College may have sold out\nso that in the long term Imperial College\nstudents have to buy in.\nHistory aside, the arrival of the next\nDirector of the Careers Service is\nanxiously awaited, so that new\nmanagement motives can be determined.\nIf we do not continue to strive for the\nbest service that can possibly be\nprovided, what point is there in recruiting\namongst the best school-leave rs and\ngiving them arguably the best technical\neducation in the country? Our graduates\nshould be placed in the best positions\navailable, and this requires a Careers\nService of excellence.\n2. College Day\nThe Board of Studies also received a report from Professor Alan Swanson\nconcerning the deliberations of the\nWorking Party on the College Day.\nI attended that meeting, along with Kevin\nTilbrook (\"Shades\"), the RCS Union\nAcademic Affairs Officer, as the student\nrepresentatives. Supporting Shades' letter\nto Felix (3rd May), I was amazed just how\nclose the College was to operating a9.00 am to 6.00pm working day from the\nstart of the next academic session. The\nRector had himself suggested, from the\nChair, its inception \"as an experiment\".\nOnce down that track, of course, there\nwould be no turning back.\nFortunately, enough strong views were\nimmediately expressed for a defer ral of\nthe discussion to the next Board of\nStudies pending a further attempt to\npersuade the student populace of the\nwisdom of such a change.\nThe Rector has now volunteered himself\nfor an informal \"Rector's Question Time\",\ndate yet to be arranged, but obviously\nbefore the next Board of Studies on 12th June. He will open himself up to\nquestions from students concerning any\naspect of student life at Imperial College,\nalthough one of the main topics will be\nthe length of the college day.\nThis is not an opportunity normally\nafforded to students in any academic\ninstitution in the country - don't waste it.\n3. Access Funds\nA brief note. The Working Party on\nAccess Funds has agreed that next year's allocation should be equally split between\ntwo groups of recipients.\nRoughly half of the allocation will be\nused to facilitate access for those with\nlimited resources who are presently\nconsidering going into further education,\nwhich is the intention of the Government\nfor the introduction of the funds. This will\nbe in the form of reasonably sized\nbursa ries. The other part of the funds will be used\nto deal with financial hardship that\nstudents already at the College are\nexperiencing. Though details are yet to\nbe finalised with Registry, the indication\nis that applications for the hardship\nelement of the funds will be invited early\nin the spring term of the next session.\nBenjamin Turner,\nICU Deputy President.\nCUP FINAL\nThis Saturday\nBAR OPEN\nFROM 1pm BIG TV Union EG M Tuesday 21st May\nBylaw Changes\n1 o 'clock\nJCR\nBE THERE!!!!!

It is ignoring me\nresolutely, content within its own sense of\nexistence.\nA variety of eyes stare out and beyond\nme. It is an enlightening, but also\nbelittling, experience they present for me\nas the mordant intricacies of the opening\ntracks etch their way in. Imagine\nsomething simultaneously brutal and\ngently insidious and you may have an\nidea of the sounds; this music is a sonic\nscalpel.\nTwo years later, after The Burning\nWorld and a disastrous involvement with\na major record label, Michael R Gira\nreturns to expose his child on the world\nstage once more. No shade of this pale,\nglittering figure is left unexplored, though\nit seems devoid of prostitution; and while\nit is neither rejecting or rejected, there is\na fairly bloody-minded approach to all\nexternal forces, and a very great sense of\nbeing. To item is e all the elements of this\nthing would be a waste of time, because\nit is clearly greater than the sum of its\nparts, but what is it? Goth? No. Goth is\nfar too small a word for this.\n'I can't even elegantly bleed out the\npoisoned blood of failure.' This is how I feel trying to write this. When Japboe\nsings, it's how one imagines an angle\nwould sound, but when Gira delivers his\nlyrics, its with a poignancy and a wryness\nreminiscent of Nick Cave at his peak.\nThis is the best album I have heard in too\nlong a time (wake y, wake y, Spiggy). So I can't contribute anything to its greatness.\nThat both it and I exist is enough for me.\nA. J.Ayer.

He\neven had a hand in writing this, which\nmay or may not explain the clich ed lyrics\nbut the overall effect is still generally\npleasing. (Which is more than I can say\nfor the B side: It sounds like the\nEurythmics, and it's crap.)\nLise Yates.\nYoung Gods\n-Play Kurt Weil LP\nA laugh a minute, this one. I was\nthinking, \"Mad Swiss trio in favourite\ndead composer shock\" as I perused the\nsleeve notes.

The question is, who will\nadmit to being a beggar, aesthetically\nspeaking? I like this. This one irony is\nenough to see me through the minor\natmospheric s and laughable German\naccents; through the fairground waltz of\nSalomon Song, the sculptured dirge of\nMachie Messer, Speak Low, etc...\nIn parts, however, this sort of histrionic\nbluster gets a bit like \"dead composer\ndecomposing\".

It must have been\nsomething in the beer, for as the band\narrived, grinning, on stage they found\nthat in fact the crowd were not people,\nbut crusty old sea dogs, drooling at the\nmouth, waiting for pops pirates, EMFs\nboot boys, to take to the stage. Baseball\ncaps trainers and guitars slung round\nnecks, with a grin they began. Invaders\nfrom the crowd, swinging in on ropes,\nknives in mouths, stage a battle ground,\nreports of hysteria, aural violence, no\nprisoners etc, total chaos. Nothing left of\nthe stage afterwards. Somebody give this\nband a record deal.\nAchooo.\nJohn.\n\n"

    "content": "Over Her Dead Body\n'Her' being Enid, a lady with a penchant for nastiness to her\nyounger sister June. Enid wears the\nkind of chic apparel which would make\nHuggy Bear spin in his flares and has a tongue on loan from a spitting cobra.\nJune is a Southern belle who unbeknown\n(naturally) to her sister is having a tumultuous fling with Enid's husband,\nwhom both have known since childhood.\nQuite why Harry should have married the\nunspeakable Enid rather than the\ninfinitely preferable June is the only real\nmystery in this film.\nThankfully, Enid bites the dust early on,\nbut unfortunately she refuses to stay\ndown. Harry deals professionally with the\nbody by telling June to lose it. June\ndoesn't like this. She deals with her\npersonal crisis by putting Enid into her\ncar, festooned with nylon string to hold\nher up, and starts up a conversation on\nher way to dump her over a cliff.\nUnfortunately it's not that easy. Enid\nran the car dry, and in her attempts to\nfend off an over-curious attendant she\nlocks the keys inside. That's okay,\nbecause Enid opens it for her. June\ncontinues, only to find that the blind\ncurve already has an upturned chicken\ntruck spilling happy avian s around the\nplace. Deterred, she carries on to a petrol\nstation and rings Harry. While she's on\nthe phone, a gentlemen of the meth s'n' brown paper bag variety tries to get off\nwith Enid ..\nSubsequent adventures take the two\nhapless and helpless assassins around,\ndown and through New Mexico while\nEnid is buried, dumped, nearly (but\nthankfully not quite ) shagged and\ngenerally abused, all the time managing\nto screw up everything for June in a wide\nrange of exciting ways. June\nmetamorphoses from a sweet if somewhat\nscatter-brained mademoiselle into a screeching hellcat; Harry gradually\ndemolishes his reputation with the police\ndepartment for which he works and all\nthis goes on for some time.\nI get the impression that this film is\nmeant to be a knock about Burt Reynolds\nkind of comedy. If it is, it fails\ncompletely. On the other hand, as a kind\nof quiet black comedy it's not bad,\nalthough maybe it goes on too long. Over\nHer Dead Body is quite a cool movie.\nThe Flying Gerbil\nThe Respectful Prostitute\nKilling blacks in southern USA\nduring the thirties was more a hobby than a crime. When nine\nblack men were accused of raping two\nprostitutes on evidence described as 'A mass of contradictions' they were sent to\nthe electric chair. The affair caused such\nuproar that Jean-Paul Sartre in his ivory\ntower decided to write a play.\nIn this play a young prostitute is\nmolested on a train by a group of white\nmen. As the blacks on the train try to\ndefend her one is shot. The killer\nhappens to be the son of the local\nsenator and considered an 'upstanding'\nman.\nThe town's people then try to make the\nprostitute testify she was raped and saved\nby the killer. More surprising is the young\ngirl's refusal to submit to this bullying.\nOnly when she is confronted with her\nneed to belong to a community does she\ndecide to lie.\nUnfortunately this moment of\ntemptation is the only gripping part of\nthe play. The senator, like a devil,\nseduces her with words which make the\naudience share the confusion about which\nman she should send to the electric chair.\nFrom Sartre's point of view here is the\ncrux of this short piece. The way you\nview a situation affects the facts. It's a shame none of the other actors can\nmatch the senator's hellish charm,\nnarrowness and a mixture of American\nand Australian accents blur this message.\nThe set wobbles precariously throughout\nand the cap-guns which are used fail to\ngo off.\nWith a play with as much weight as\nthis one, distractions make the whole\nthing look ludicrous. The performance\nshould be tighter and more confident.\nAlthough the venue (The Etcetera\nTheatre, Oxford Arms, Camden) proves\nthat theatre is not exclusively for people\nwho drive Bentley's and wear bow ties. A worthy enterprise but a flawed\nproduction.\nJonty.\nWhen What Where\nThe Respectful Prostitute\nJulie Hes Two\nLovers\nL.A.

They staggered\ntowards their allocated flat, and collapsed,\nsleeping only fitfully in anticipation of the\nstruggles they knew lay ahead.\nThe following morning, the gruelling\ntask of conquering the mountain began.\nEquipped with the best gear money could\nrent, they proceeded immediately to the\ntop of the most difficult slope, and with\ntotal disregard for their own safety began\ntheir crash-course in skiing and mountain\nsurvival.\n. Later that day, remarkably with limbs\nstill intact, the more valiant members of\nthe team proved to be a match for the\nbest skiers in France and continental\nEurope could throw at them. In the first\nevent, the 'downhill towed-toboggan',\ndespite cracked ribs and the lack of\ncamera-angle, the team finished a bitter\nsecond (with only frostbite as a consolation), but it was a brave start!\nThe late afternoon saw the second\nevent, the 'mate la sp neum at i que'. Again\nthe 'mixed equip e' giving as good as they\ngot, retiring only when darkness fell, to\nthe sanctity of their official residence.\nCleansed and refreshed, the unstoppable\nfive became the unstoppable six with the\nwelcome arrival of Ben 'Ski-Man' Turner\nesq, official team Champagne Bearer, and\nexperienced veteran of the black slopes.\nIn addition to the successful 'downhill\nbate a up neum at i que', the second day was\nhighlighted by an excellent display of\nnight team skating in the skating relay-race. A superb performance, equalled by\nfew other equip es, set the IC/INPG team\nfirmly in the top ten, cementing their\nreputation as a dark horse not be trifled\nwith. This was only confirmed further at\nthe discotheque later that night.\nThe following day, blizzards and fog\ncancelled the day's competitive events.\nBut, bravely undaunted, the team\ncontinued their training, well establishing\ntheir intimate knowledge of the snow\nplough. That night, the 'Careers Fair' took\nplace, although with the benefit of the\nMoet & Chandon and Chatreuse\npromotions, only some sketchy details are\nleft of this.\nThe final day dawned far too brightly.\nAghast at their sudden vulnerability, the\nteam gulped down their croissants and\nrushed to begin the first event, the\ndownhill BMX. Then the 'descent e au ski-bike'. The person who thought of these\ntwo should be made to pay the medical\ninsurance premiums for all the\ncompetitors for at least the next five\nyears. Without disgracing ourselves, we\nthrew ourselves into the last big event,\nthe dreaded 'mate la sp neum at i que'. In the end, the IC and INPG team came\nin at 9th place out of 30. Not bad for a team consisting of Irish-Italians,\nAustralians and Anglo-French expatriates!\nThe real reason behind this article is to\nexpress the gratitude of the team towards\nall those who helped us to get to Alpe\nd 'Huez, both for their encouragement,\nfootwork and financial support. These\ninclude the Rector, STA travel, the\nDepartment of Aeronautics, the IC Union\nthe rector of INPG, and especially Lynda\nand Liz of the PR office.\nMerci pour vo tres out ien et\nenthusiasm e! Fun Run\nTomorrow at 11pm, runners taking part\nin the \"lOOm ph Fun Run\" will be starting\noff from the Sports Centre. Each\nparticipant can run/jog/walk up to 10\nmiles in the 1 hour time limit to raise\nmoney for Cancer charities. And it's not\ntoo late to take part!\nIf you want to raise money for Cancer\nResearch, sponsorship forms are still\navailable from the Sports Centre. Simply\ncollect a form, collar as many people as\npossible to sponsor you, and turn up at\nthe Sports Centre at 10.30am Saturday to\nregister for the run. Before the start at\n11am all runners will be given a number\nwhich will allow them to be timed and\nthe distance of their run calculated.\nThe \"Fun Run\" is being organised by IC\nS& WPC which is sponsored by Salomon\nBrothers International Limited and\nCoopers & Lybrand Deloitte. Our thanks\nto all those who have already picked up\nsponsorship forms - see you at the\nweekend.\nWine\nTasting\nIn the absence of the Inter-University\nWine Challenge this year, Monday 13\nMay saw the most important event of the\nyear for the Wine Tasting Society, the\nstaff against student competition.\nDavid Rowe, former member of the\nsociety and now editor of Decanter\nmagazine, set the teams eight wines to\ntaste asking them to name the grape, the\ncountry, the region, the sub-region, the\nvintage and the producer. The reason for\nthe wry smile Mr Rowe was sporting\nthrough the tasting became evident as the\ncorrect answers were revealed. Mr Rowe\nhad chosen an interesting and unusual\nrange of wines from a variety of\ncountries including Chile and Greece.\nOverall, the contest was a close run\nthing. The students narrowly won by\nscoring 689 compared to the staff's647. Also, there was a competition to find the\ntop individual scorer of each team;\ncongratulations go to Kevin McKoen of\nthe students who scored 90 and to Martin\nHow, an IC Chemistry undergraduate\nfrom 1973 to 1976, who scored 85. Each\ntook home a bottle of Pol Roger\nChampagne, said to be Winston\nChurchill's favourite drink.\nCommenting on the contest, Diana\nPatterson-Fox, of the staff, said 'It was a good clean fought contest'. However,\nJulian Wilson, also of the staff but a former IC student and society member,\ndeclared 'We woz robbed!' and went on\nto claim that the students drank all the\nwine before he had had a chance to even\ntaste it. This was said in jest though.\nMany others, both staff and students,\nenjoyed the evening and expressed an\ninterest in repeating the event in future\nyears.\nICSO\nAre you tired of Friday Night revision?\nAre you tired of trying to work on\nFridays? Why not make a change and\ncome to see the Imperial College\nSymphony Orchestra perform in the\nGreat Hall this Friday. We shall be\nplaying Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto,\nSuite from the Sleeping Beauty by\nTchaikovsky, and others including a piece\nabout the Chinese Chairman Mao's dancing.\nAs always with Orchestra concerts\nthere will be a bar extension until\nmidnight to complement the evening's music.\nThe concert begins at 8pm and is\nexpected to finish at 10pm.

    "content": "Editoria\nAfter a couple of weeks where there was\nvirtually nothing to write about, this\nweek is overflowing with corruption,\nscandal, outrageous rent demands, and\nmore of the fun things that cheer me up\non a Thursday afternoon.\nYet again, Students expected to pay\nfor Colleges mistakes...\nIf you've read the news, you should know\nthat next years rents for College\nAccommodation have been released. You\nmay also of realised that they are just a tad higher than this year.\nIn fact, you can have lots of fun with\nthe list and a calculator. For example,\ntake your typical room, say a single in\nTizard hall: Currently you'd be paying\n\u00a346 for a minimum of 31 weeks. A couple of quick key-presses later, and you\nfind out that this amounts to \u00a31426 over\nthe year. Next year, however, you'd be\npaying \u00a352 a week. A few more taps on\ngood old Mr Calculator, and you see that\nthis is a13% rise, with inflation at 10.5%.\nBut then you realise that you'd be\npaying for a minimum of 34 weeks (ie,\nyou have to pay for Christmas, whether\nyou're staying or not). So, for the whole\nyear you'd be paying \u00a31768, which is an\noverall increase of 24%, and no, inflation\nhasn't changed, it's still only 10.5%\nThen there are the rooms where you\nhave to pay for 38 weeks, which means\npaying for both Christmas and Easter.\nThese rooms are basically aimed at\noverseas students, who normally don't go\nhome until the summer. That's fair\nenough, you think. But here comes the\ncunning part. Over Easter the\naccommodation office runs the Easter\nLetting Scheme, where they let out rooms\nin halls to people attending conferences,\netc. Now, when they do that, the people\nconcerned normally want a block letting,\nwhere all the rooms on, for example, two\nstaircases, are let to a specific company\nor group of people. To enable them to do\nthis the accommodation office want to\nallocate certain areas in hall as being 38\nweek rooms, and the others as 34 week\nrooms. This, as a pure coincidence, will\nmean that the majority of the overseas\nstudents will be living in one or two\n'blocks' in a hall, which strikes me as\nbeing a brilliant way to encourage\nintegration within a hall. Mmmm.\nSo why are they doing this? Well, as I noted last week, the accommodation\nsector of College has debts currently.,\ntotalling about \u00a320.5 million, which is\neven more than my overdraft, and which\nhas interest repayments alone of \u00a31.7\nmillion. How did they get this far in the\nred? Well, one would be tempted to\nassume there has been some bad\nmanagement at some point. As I said last\nweek, Estates Director Gordon Marshal\ntold me he could not comment on past\nmanagement decisions. But when asked\nwhy there was such a large debt, he\nclaimed that the level of borrowing must\nof been seen to be reasonable at the\ntime. That's very likely, isn't it? I mean\n\u00a320.5 million seems like a reasonable\nlevel of borrowing...\nGetting back to reality, there have\ndefinitely been some big boo-boos. The\none that immediately springs to mind is\nClayponds, which cost \u00a311 million. Now,\nEstates will deny this, but the purchase of\nClayponds was inherently linked to the\nsale of Montpelier Hall (I 've read the\npaper given at the meeting which decided\nwhat to do). At the time when the\ndecisions were being made College was\ninformed that Montpelier would raise \u00a37.5\nto \u00a310 million, which covers the majority\nof Clayponds.\nHowever, College was unable to sell\nMontpelier for conversion into a hotel\n(the original plan), due to a problem with\nthe deeds, which stated that the site had\nto be used for educational purposes. For\nthis screw-up, College Business Manager\nTom Stevens lost his job (yet again,\nCollege will deny this, but they haven't given any other reason, it was his job to\ncheck these things, and the timing of the\ndismissal was far too close for it to be a coincidence). This left College a bit stuck:\nThey'd paid out \u00a311 million, and were\nunable to get any money back. On top of\nthis, Government regulations state that\nCollege Accommodation has to be self\nfinancing, so College couldn't use any of\nits University Funding Council grant to\nget them out of the poo-poo. On top of\nthis, when they eventually do sell\nMontpelier, they'll only be getting \u00a34-5\nmillion.\nSo, we are left with a situation where\nAccommodation is in a teensy bit of\nfinancial trouble, and in order to help get\nthemselves out of a mess they created,\nCollege has decided to screw the students\nover for even more money. In addition to\nthis they intend to screw-up the\natmosphere and integration of the halls\nby effectively segregating overseas\nstudents. What a good idea...\nI 've got a far more cunning one. The\nway I see it, the major purpose of College\nAccommodation in London is to provide\ncheap accommodation with easy access to\ncollege, primarily for Freshers, the\nmajority of whom haven't lived in\nLondon and/or on their own before, and\nthus are in the greatest need. The current\nplan is not really achieving this. So why\nnot sell Clayponds?\nWhat you do is wait a year, until all the\nrenovations are finished. Then you've got\na site which is half brand new, and half\nlived in for a year. Given the increase in\nland value and the renovation work, it's got to be worth \u00a315 million. By this time\nMontpelier should have been sold, which\nis another \u00a35 million or so, and, Hey\nPresto, all the problems have\ndisappeared! The ideal way to do it\nwould be to find a potential buyer now,\nwho would be willing to put down a deposit on the site, thus paying off the\ninterest for this year. Then you don't have to put up the rents, and as\nClayponds was never intended for\nFreshers, you don't impinge upon your\nability to promise a year in hall to all\nnew students. Pretty cunning, heh? The\nchances of college doing this, or even\nlooking into it? What do you think?\nMeet the man responsible\nUnion President Paul Shanley is trying to\norganise a question- and-answer session\nwith Estates Director Gordon Marshal,\ninvolving a couple of people from each\nHall of residence , to discuss\naccommodation issues.

He describes his treatment as\na script writer for television, continuously\nbeing let down. His plays are avoided by\nthe West End because of their portrayal\nof homosexuality.

    "content": "Fete Worse than Death\nLast Saturday's Rag Fete suffered from a lack of student attendance. The Fete,\nwhich in past years has been termed a success, had a poor turnout and\nconsequently made little money. The\nQueen's Lawn, the usual venue, was\nabandoned due to the college having\nremoved the turf.\nPublicity for the event beforehand was\nlow key with posters appearing only a short time before the event. Raffle tickets\nwere on sale the week before, but were\nnot widely available, reducing the money\ngained and attendance yet further. Their\ntechnique lacked the organisation shown\nby the people collecting on behalf of\nChristian Aid on Monday around College.\nSeventeen stalls were listed in last\nweeks Felix, the day before the fe te, but\nan estimated half that number were\ncounted on the day. The people in\nattendance numbered less than one\nhundred spaced though out the afternoon,\nnot including the onlookers from the\nHalls of Residence surrounding Prince's Gardens. Only a fraction of the 400\nballoons were actually released due to\nlack of interest. In total some \u00a3300 was\ntaken over the afternoon with a net profit\nof \u00a3100. The Karaoke night, organised by\nUNICEF, was thought to a good idea by\nmost, but was also marred by lack of\nnumbers.\nFlemming Heino, this year's event\norganiser blamed the poor turnout on\npoor publicity and the fact that there was\nno rag Fete last year. The Rag Chairman\nis planning to make next year's Rag Fete\nmuch larger and to have a 'proper rag\nweek like other Universities'. Winners of the 1991 Hide and Seek Finals\nNo Ball\nGames\nThe Evelyn Gardens end of year ball has\nbeen cancelled because permission cannot\nbe obtained to use the land behind the\nWest side of the gardens.\nThe trustees of the garden, Cluttons,\nrefused to give their permission for the\nparty when they were asked by Colin\nChurch, sub warden of Southwell Hall.\nThey justified this response by saying that\nthey could not give their consent because\nof the inconvenience that it would cause\nlocal residents. Negotiations began, but\neven the offer of extending invitations to\nprivate residents and finishing the ball at\nmidnight failed to sway the trustees.\nIndividual houses are now planning\ntheir own end of year parties separately,\nand may use the i and without permission,\nas in past years.\nEGM Tues\nPaul Shanley, Union President has called\nan Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM)\ndeal with rearrangements within the\nstructure of the Union. The EGM, which\nwill take place at 1.00pm on Tuesday in\nthe JCR, will contain motions to abolish\nseveral Union posts without which the\nUnion council should be able to run more\neasily. Mr Shanley claims that the\nchanges will be purely internal, and that\nany student not heavily involved in the\nUnion office would notice no change.\nWhoops\nChris Browne, the driver of the Union\nminibus towed away by police last week,\nhas had another mishap.

This involves the whole of the\nsociety, both the acting and the technical\nside, for we run the largest student venue\non the Fringe. We hire a church hall (on\nPrinces Street) for virtually the whole of\nAugust, which, in four days, we turn into\na theatre. Then for the three weeks of\nthe festival we have a large number of\ndifferent companies sub-letting from us,\nwhile we also stage two plays ourselves.\nFinally in one night we 'strike' the set\nand flee back to grimy London.\n'Saint John's Church has been the venue\nrun by TWE for countless years. It has a quite remarkable seat, under looking the\nmagnificent castle, that imposes itself on\nthe end of the Royal Mile. People flock to\nit from the four corners of the town to\nadmire the wonderful performances\nthat...that...that; oh dear...is that\nenough?'\u2014TWE Exec.\nDramSoc travels in the guise of TWE,\n'Theatre West End' (our large yellow sign\nwill no doubt be familiar to any visitors\nto the Fringe) and our brief is to provide\na comprehensive service to our sub-lets.\nFrom managing entries in the Fringe\nProgramme, to selling tickets, from\nrunning the front of house to providing\ntechnical support, it all has to be done.\nThis may sound a little hectic, but there\nwill be a large team running the venue,\nand so everyone will be able to see their\nfill of wie rd and wonderful shows and, of\ncourse, soak-up their fair share of Diet\nPepsi in the Fringe Club.\nCoupled closely with T WE is TWEP or\n'Theatre West End Productions'. This is\nthe company of actors that go up from\nImperial to perform. This year we have\ntwo 'slots' (two hours a day running for\ntwo of the three weeks of the festival),\ncurrently the plan is for two shows\nrunning alternately. This year we have\nchosen the children's plays The Hour of\nthe Werewolf and Mr A's Amazing Maze\nPlays. Whether or not these reach the\nsame level of critical acclaim as 1989's shows Huis Clos and Funeral Games\ndepends largely on you!\n'It is great fun to work with the sub-lets, as long as they don't blaspheme too\nmuch (well it is a church after all), and\neven if they do it only adds to the\nexcitement really. I mean, well, we had\nthe press here last year after being\n(wrongly) accused of censorship, of course\nit only served to boost our ticket\nsales...'\u2014TWE Administrator.\nYou may be wondering just how you can\nbluff your way into this close knit circle.\nMany skills are required, however they\ndivide broadly into two halves, acting and\ntechnical; both of these are vital to the\nrunning of the venue. The acting side\ndoes not only require people to stand on\nstage pretending to be Oliviers/as, but\nalso:\nMake-up artists. Hair, face, hands and\nsometimes whole bodies have to have\nliberal quantities of colourful greasy paint\nsmeared over them. The requirements\nare to be able to compliment people's hair, pretend to be from a Philadelphia\nadvert, and know the difference between\nmascara and eye-liner.\nStage managers. Must be able to\nremember where the props from the last\nperformance landed when the cast ran\nthrough the dressing room, restrain\nthemselves from eating any of the edible\nprops while waiting for the show to start\nand sym pathis e with disconsolate\nthespians when they miss-accentuate the\nthird word of their seventeenth line in\nthe second act. Anyone interested must\nbe able to win at pel man is m and\nunderstand the rules of Mornington\nCrescent.\nSet-designers. Those wonderful studios\ndon't just appear overnight. This job\nstraddles any remaining vestiges of the\nancient actor/tech ie split. There are\nneeds such as balancing the fl ambo yancy of an over-enthusiastic director, with the\npossibilities allowed by having to erect\nand dismantle the entire show in about\nfifteen minutes. Restraining the urges of a light-crazed Technical Director preventing\npsychedelic outbursts mid-way through\nthe wooing of two lovers (on stage...). Or\nsimply ensuring that there are enough\nexits from the set to allow the play to be\nperformed. Potential candidates should be\nable to shout in tune and use an electric\nscrewdriver without amputating any\nlimbs.\nClearly a good cast is vital to the tour.\nSo anyone who feels they might like to\nfollow in the footsteps of Peter Cooke, or\nDudley Moore, or Rowan Atkinson or Fry\nand Laurie, or Joe Mangel (sic) or Ben\nElton or of any one of countless thespians\nwho have trodden any of the various\nbora ds at this world renowned festival,\nshould at least be very interested.\n8\nDramsoc Goes North\nQualifications are minimal, self-control (or\nfailing this naivety); in reality they are\nlaughing AT you, not WITH you.\nExpression the old maxim still holds true\n'always be sincere, whether you mean it\nor not', (Oh, and it does help to be able\nto learn the odd few lines of dialogue).\n'Edinburgh is nice in the summertime;\nthere are many butter fie s skating through\nthe warm summer breeze, young couples\nplaying gaily on the green...shit I forgot\nthe bit at the rest. That'll do that'll do.\nLet's have a good sharking'\u2014TWE\nThespian.\nMany people are also required to help\nrun the technical side of the venue\n(affectionately known as Techies).\nLights. If you came to the last carnival\nin the Union Building then you might\nhave noticed our Lighting Director,\nattention rapt, beads of sweat forming on\nhis brow, drinking Pineapple Tango. He is\nstanding at the back of the concert hall,\nplaying an instrument with more keys\nthan a piano. Times would appear to\nhave advanced a bit from standing by the\ndoor playing with the dimmer switch, for\nhe was controlling the lights. There is\nmore to this than at first appears. The\nlighting 'rig' has to be designed, the lights\nobtained, hung, pointed, set and only\nthen can they be turned on and off!\nAnyone interested in (or with an aptitude\nfor...) climbing large scaffolding towers,\ncreating monsters out of cables and sticky\ntape or seeing just how much power can\nbe drawn from a wall socket, should\nconsider this.\nSound. I think that it is a myth that\npeople who work on sound have to\nchain-smoke, but most of DramSoc would\nbe very glad to have it proved to them.\nEqually it would be nice to have someone\naround who, when faced with the\nequivalent power of ten large Hi-Fi units\nrunning together, did not insist in\nchecking the stability of the foundations\nto Hawkwind! Clearly though this is a very demanding side of the theatre.\nSound effects tapes have to be made up\nto order, spliced when the director\ndecides that your long sought after rabid\ngoldfish sounds more like a trout on heat,\nand then pal ye d on cue (bearing in mind\nthat the actors usually rewrite the entire\nscript between the last dress rehearsal\nand the first performance). Try this if you\nare interested in razor blades, or dry\nsherry.\nThere is also a whole class of jobs that\nwill be shared around amongst everyone\nwho comes with us to the Festival. We\nhave a box-office that has to be manned\nall day (if only to cash cheques from the\nrest of the crew). The sub-letting\ncompanies have to be tended; because\nplays are run throughout the day in quick\nsuccession there is only a short time to\nset-up and dismantle each performance.\nAnd, of course, the audience, screaming,\nshouting and (hopefully) numbering about\none hundred, have to be ushered in and\nout (and have the requisite amount of\nmoney exacted from them).\n'What is that woman doing? You know\nyou just can't get the cast these days, it's just no good. But that rig, gives me that\nlong thing from the head of a rhinoceros...where's that POG (pint of\nGuinness)...\u2014TWE Techie.\nClearly there are many possibilities and if\nyou fancy something a little different\nfrom backpacking across the Himalayas\nthis August come and see us. We will 'be\nthrowing a party on the Union Concert\nHall stage this coming Wednesday at 1pm for everyone interested in anything.\nThere will be a chance to meet everyone\nwho is already involved in this strange\nsport, and decide which of.the groups\nabove you wish to be involved in. After\nthe FREE LUNCH there will be the first of\nthe auditions for the TWEP plays.\nSo that is the Edinburgh Fringe Festival\nDramSoc style. Of course it is 'a wonderful opportunity', 'not to be missed',\nand so on, if you are interested in joining\nour merry bunch for the month of August\n(or just some of it) then come along to\nour party. Or failing that contact the\nDramSoc storeroom (college extension\n3531) any lunchtime.\nParty details\nIt is free\nIt is on the Concert Hall\nStage (Union Building)\nIt starts at 1pm on\nWednesday 22 May\nActors: TWEP will be\nrecruiting cast and support.\nTechies: Auditions for\neverything from mixing\nsound to changing light bulbs\nIt is free\nDaniel Shields\n9\n\n"

    "content": "L.A. Story\nAfter his disappointing box office\nand critical performance in My Blue\nHeaven, Steve Martin returns to\nform with the very amusing LA Story.\nIn the movie, Martin plays Harris K Telemacker, a TV weatherman. Stuck in\na relationship with a girlfriend he has\nlittle in common with, and a job that\nembarrasses him, salvation emerges when\nfate brings him to an electronic freeway\nsign with a mind of its own, which tells\nhim his life is about to change. This may\nall sound completely ridiculous but it is\nvery enjoyable stuff. The plot, such as it\nis, revolves around Martin and real life\nwife, Victoria Tennant, trying to find true\nlove with each other amidst the urban\njungle of Los Angeles.\nMartin gives an unusually restrained\nperformance, and the chemistry between\nhimself and Tennant works well. Richard\nE Grant is good as Tennant's thoroughly LA itself, as Steve Martin (who also wrote\nEnglish ex-husband, and Sarah Jessica the script) beautifully pokes fun at the\nParker is terrific as the energetic, pretentiousness and downright stupidity\nnymphomaniac shop assistant who gets often found in LA society,\ninvolved with Martin. The movie is filled with wry comments\nHowever the real star of the movie is and witty remarks on contemporary LA\nJulia Has Two Lovers\nJulia (Daphna Hastner) has one\nlover, Jack (David Charles), who\nwants to marry her. He also wants\nher to be chained to the kitchen sink so\nshe is a little undecided. As Jack leaves\nfor work she receives a phone call, a wrong number. This quickly develops into\na heart to heart, a swapping of intimate\nexperiences and sexual technique, first\nverbally then in practice. Therefore Julia\nnow has two lovers (where did they get\nthe title from?). Unfortunately Daniel\n(David Duchovny) makes dates by wrong\nnumbers as a hobby. While Daniel\ndecides Julia is the one for him, she is\nnot pleased about his pastime. She\nLa Amiga n Set Argentina, during and after the\nyears of fascist dictatorship, La\nAmiga centres on two women's friendship, their lives and dreams, which\nare utterly transformed by the terrible\nrealities of political events.\nThe film starts with the two characters'\nchildhood in Buenos Aires, when Raquel,\ndespised by other kids because of her\nJewish origin, gets protection from Maria.\nThey thus develop an ever-lasting\nfriendship and promise to become\nactresses. \u2022 . . *.\nYears later, Raquel does become a famous Argentine actress and the lover of\na politician, while Maria goes for the life\nof a typical housewife with a husband\nand three kids. The eldest of them is\ninvolved in an underground political\nreforms her life and concludes in a new\nliberated way of life.\nAs well as having a lousy Mills and\nBoon plot, David Charles cannot act to\nsave his testicles from a barbecue, and\ncan barely remember his lines. Through\nthe deadpan acting, little sympathy\ndevelops for any of the characters'\nterrible plights.\nDespite this the film does have saving\ngraces. The seduction over the telephones\nis truly intimate and gently light-hearted.\nAlthough some of the confessions appear\nto have been lifted from a Just 17\nproblem page. The lovers' final drunken\nmeeting is funny as they bargain over\nmovement and disappears after the arrest\nby the government's secret forces. Maria\nasks for Raquel's help, who in turn is\nthreatened and has to flee for West\nGermany where she leads a life totally\ndifferent from the glamour she had\nenjoyed in Argentina. Meanwhile, Maria\njoins other mothers who also have\nmissing children and demonstrates at\ndifferent places. Raquel realises how\nmuch Maria has changed when the latter\ngoes to Germany to meet a friend of her\nlost son. Because of her uncompromising\ncharacter, Maria refuses to believe her\nson is dead. When military dictatorship in\nArgentina comes to an end in 1983,\nRaquel returns to Buenos Aires, only to\nfind it hard to start her career all over\nagain, while Maria still refuses her child's life. There is also a fair share of wild\nmadcap comedy (a gunfight on the\nfreeway for one thing!) and this mixture\nof styles works surprisingly well.\nThere are some fun jokes based on\nShakespeare quotes, including the 'grave\ndigging' scene from Hamlet, cameos from\nRick Moranis and Chevy Chase, and even\na reference to that classic Steve Martin\nmovie\u2014The Man with Two Brains, as he\nreads the poem Pointy Birds.\nBritish director Mick Jackson handles\nthings well, at a fast, yet comfortable\nspeed, whilst making very good use of\nthe Los Angeles locations.\nSteve Martin fans will love the movie,\nbut even if you're not a big fan of his,\nyou should still enjoy his exaggerated yet\npoignant observations of life in LA.\nThe movie also contains some crackling\ndialogue\u2014'Darling, your breasts feels\nstrange' says Martin, 'Oh, that's because\nthey're real' comes the reply, and despite\none or two overly sentimental scenes, LA\nStory adds up to 95 minutes of great\nentertainment.\nThe Don.\nwho is to 'have' Julia.\nOf course the film is set in Los Angeles;\nthis is a pain, as you could get the idea\nthat Hollywood is the twisted Mecca of\nWestern art; the plot appears to be strung\ntogether around the sound idea of a seduction by wrong number, so all the\nother parts of the film are flimsy in\ncomparison. Daphna Kastner, who wrote\nthe script as well as starring has to be\ncongratulated for this achievement. All\nthe same a higher level of sexual drama\nis witnessed in Sex, Lies and Videotape,\nwhich is practically the same plot, just far\nsuperior.\nJonty.\ndeath and continues as the leader of the\nmothers.\nArgentinian director Jeanine Meeraptel\nopts for an emotional approach for the\nfilm, making it a political version of\nBeaches. It will attract a wider audience\ndespite its serious background. But\npowerful scenes like the mothers'\ndemonstration are made in a sentimental\nway. The idea of comparison of the\nArgentinians' fever for the World Cup,\nwith their indifference towards the futile\ngovernment is good but turns out to be\ntoo dramatic. However, these minor flaws\nin the film are covered by a strong script\nand outstanding performances,\nparticularly that of Liv Ullmanj, from a shy housewife to a self-confident leader of\nthe women.\nS. Su.\n\n"
