    "content": "[OPINIONI\nThis week's Soapbox is provided by Imperial\nCollege Friends of Palestine, a newly formed\nsociety about to become members of OSC. In\nthis article they outline their ideas on the\nPalestine problem.\nThe Palestinian\nHolocaust\nThe Need to Act\nThe outcome of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the siege of Beirut has added another sad chapter to the long and never ending\nstrife between Arab and Israeli. The Israeli venture, which was\noriginally launched under the false pretext of 'defending' Israeli\nsettlements in the Galilee, began with the Israeli semi-destruction of\nseveral towns and villages in the South of Lebanon (and the total\ndemolition of Palestinian refugee camps, such as E in Hilweh south\nwest of Sidon), and led to the horrific siege of West Beirut and the\nmassacres at Sabra and Chalilla refugee camps. Israel has thereby\nmanaged to successfully add to its long list of malpractices and breaches of international law and the United Nations Charter (such\nas annexing the Golan Heights, building more Jewish settlements on the occupied territories, refusing to award the prisoners of war status\nto Palestinian prisoners and torturing them, enforcing collective\npunishment etc.). The measure of materialistic destruction is\nbeyond description, with tens of thousands of civilians killed and\nhundreds of thousands made homeless.\nPLO Peacemakers\nOnce again, the events in the Lebanon have come out with a strong and clear message about the need to find a solution to the\nPalestinian question. Israel's approach towards solving the problem\nis to ignore the rights of the Palestinian people as has been reflected\nin Israel's past and present policy ( Gold a Meir at one time denied\nthat the Palestinians existed. Begin and Sharon have come up with\nan up-to-date version with the ridiculous claim that Jordan provides\na national home for the Palestinians.) Israel has to realise that\nreconciliation is better than confrontation. Unlike the PLO who has\nalways sought towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, the\nIsraelis have chosen to continue to ignore the rights of the\nPalestinians and even directed a policy of oppression against the\nPalestinians in the West Bank. In1974, the chairman of the executive\ncouncil of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, called for an establishment of a secular democractic state in Palestine (Israel), where Arabs and\nJews could live in peace side by side. Most Palestinians accepted\nthe idea of a secular state but sadly the Israelis rejected it. Later on, the PLO showed further moderation by contemplating the\n. establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank\nand Gaza strip but Begin has recently referred to the West Bank as\n\"Western Eretz Israel\" thus reviving the revisionist notion that the\nhistorical land of Israel also included the east bank of the river\nJordan. It is encouraging though, to see that some Israelis such as the\n'Peace Now' movement have spoken openly for Palestinian rights\nand have opposed the extremist policies of the Begin government. It\nis on this understanding that peace in the Middle East could be\nachieved.\nIsraeli Torture Camps\nMost Palestinians in the Lebanon, of whom there are 237,000\nrefugees registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency ( U NRW A) and probably as many again not registered, have\nhad their lives disrupted in one way or another in the recent fighting.\nLike fellow Lebanese who had their homes destroyed, they are now\nliving in partially demolished buildings with as many as twelve\npeople living in one small bedroom in some cases. U NRW A is setting\nup 13,000 tents to accommodate the huge number of homeless\npeople. This is however not to be thought of as a permanent situation\nwhere everything has gone back to normal. The situation is very far\nfrom normal and the problem of Lebanon is even more complex than\nit ever was before. As for the Palestinians in Lebanon, they now find\nthem selve rs under the mercy of Israel, who have detained almost\nevery male between the ages of twelve and sixty-two at the Ansar\nconcentration camp in the South. Horrific memories of concentration camps in the Second WorldWar are now being\nrevived with the Israelis beating Palestinian prisoners to death and\nusing varied methods of torture.\nMaronite ButcheryThe Israeli operation has been given American blessings if not full\nsupport right from the beginning. United Nations resolutions calling\nupon Israel to withdraw from the Lebanon were initially vetoed by\nthe US, who did not attempt to exert any kind of military nor\neconomic pressure on Israel (the US being Israel's main supplier of\nmilitary equipment and economic aid). At a time when Israel was\nbesieging Beirut (and was using highly destructive weapons such as\ncluster, phosphorus and vacuum bombs, in the small and highly\ncivilian populated area), the US and all the Western press, were\ncalling upon the PLO to evacuate Beirut, as if the PLO were the\naggressors. To prevent the Israelis from bombing Beirut until total\ndestruction, the PLO has agreed to be evacuated, doing so at the\nrisk of leaving Palestinian women and children in the camps\nundefended. Everybody (some more than others though) came to\nregret that, as the familiar nature of Begin and his fascist allies rose\nto the surface and the genocide at Sabra and Chatilla was committed.\nThe men who butchered the Palestinians in the camps were not a random band of mercenaries. According to reports they were\nmembers of an organised unit of the Lebanese Froces, the Maronite\nmilitia built up by Bashir Gemayel with Israeli help and equipment.\nCooperation at a high level was proven to have existed between the\nLebanese Froces and the Israeli army who even provided flares to\nilluminate the scene of the crime during the night. The massacres\nwere carried out in order to cause the Palestinians to flee out of Lebanon. The same ruthless policy was carried out by Begin in 1948\nat Deir Yassin when the massacre there caused panic and led to the\nmass exodus of Palestinians out of Palestine. (This tied in very\nconveniently with the Zionist aim of creating an exclusively Jewish\nstate in Palestine).\nVictims of Oppression\nThe facts and statistics mentioned above, and other facts which\nhave not been mentioned, depict the desperate need for positive\naction. The Imperial College Friends of Palestine is a society,\ncomprising Palestinian and non Palestinian students, with the\nobjective of promoting the understanding of the facts about the\nMiddle East problem. It aims towards introducing Palestinian\nculture explaining the effect the diaspora has had on Palestinian way\nof life and the emergence of the PLO as a movement of national\nresistance. In its General Meeting, the society managed to attract a large number of students who showed particular interest in, and\nregular enthusiasm for learning about the Palestinian question. The society believes in the right of the Palestinian people to live in\nsecurity ar.d in peace within an independent state of their own. The society also believes (in accordance with the belief of the majority of Palestinians), that the PLO is the sole and legitimate representative\nof the Palestinian people and that any solution to the conflict cannot\nbe achieved without the active participation of the PLO as\nrepresentatives of the Palestinian people. The society views with\ngreat concern, the present and future condition of the victims of war\nand of oppression, and will participate in making more bearable the\ntragedy to which they have been subjected.\nImperial College Friends of Palestine\nNovember 12,19821 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Dirty Linen\nThe sad fact that eight out of every ten\nyoungsters who are put in detention in borst al 'training' centres are on the slippery slope to a life of crime makes such institutions perennial\nsubjects for examination.\nIn Scrubbers, the director, Mia Zetterling,\nattempts to do this through the eyes of the\ninmates of a closed women's borst al: their\nfears, their motivations.their reactions to the\nalien environment they find themselves in. This\neffect is enhanced by clever lighting of the\nbuilding interiors to give them a flat, lifeless\nfeel.\nComparisons are bound to be made\nbetween this film of a closed women's borst a land Scrum, its notorious predecessor portraying the equivalent male institution. This\nfilm is far less patronising to the audience and\nmore believable. In Scrubbers, the institution\nis not run along mob lines with violence and\nhomosexual rape common occurrences while\nthe impotent authorities try to keep some\nsemblance of order. This film is compassionate\nand at times humorous. Lesbianism and violence do occur, but these are an undertone\nto a study of characters under stress\nattempting to get through their sent ances. The\nBBC's Porridge series would be a better\nsimile than Scum, although it never degenerates into sitcom humour.\nIt is this, probably unconscious, similarity\nthat is interesting. For an institution supposed\nto be geared to the correction of the delinquent youngster rather than the 'old lag',\nthe only training going on appeared to be for\nprison. Just another penal dustbin for society's dirty linen.\nIt is a pity that in the rush to make sanguine\npoints about penal reform, the poor old prison\nwarders or 'screws' get sadly neglected. They\n\u2022 B REVIEWS Bi are the person if ici ation of authority against\nwhich the girls must unite. Were the screws to\nshow one streak of humanity, your feelings of\naffection for a bunch of wildcats that most of\nus would go a long distance out of our way to\navoid, would be lessened.\nThis affection is a credit to the convincing\nacting of the whole cast, for the most of whom\nthis is their first film role. Chrissie Cotterill was\nparticularly fine as Annetta, a woman with a rather over developed maternal instinct and a i penchant for truck drivers. Amanda York also\nmastered a difficult part as Carol, a complex\nmixture of toughness and vulnerability.\nThe British Film Festival is on for the next\nfortnight at the National Film Theatre (see last\nweeks Walkabout Looksee for location) and is\nwell worth a visit. It includes many rare and\ninteresting films, as well as a posthumous\ntribute to Werner Fassbinder showing many\nfilms from his tragically short directing career.\nLee Paddon\nRPlyAL SCWOl Of M1N\u00a3S& INSTITUT FRANCAIS\n:\nBATHROBE 6\" PRESSING \"tj owN FARTY !\nPRESENT\nWITH VIDEO DI SCO SOUTHERN COMFORT\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ~ J CR FRIDAY |7 NOVEMBER\n8 - OOP M TIL LATE\nJAZZ BAND\nSTARTS 8-30PM WITH BATHROBE\n-ALL OTHERS \u2014' \u00a3 \\S0\nFELIX November 12,1982 Page 9\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\ncontinued from page 4\nBar Accounts\nDear Martin\nSince you have mentioned my\nname in your last editorial as\npressing for bar accounts to be\navailable to the Bar Committee I would appreciate the opportunity to say why.\nThe Bar Committee's terms of\nreference which we assumed\nvalid, and were never challenged\nwere provided by MrI Thomas\n(Domestic Manager and Secretary to the Refectory Committee)\nwho had them since he joined\nthe Bar Committee. No other\nterms of reference have ever\nreached the Bar Committee.\nSection 3 of these terms of\nreference reads as follows:\n3. The duties of the SubCommittees are:\na) To report on all matters of\npolicy and finance to the\nRefectory Committee.\nb) To advise the Refectory\nManager on the day-to-day\nrunning of the bars and the\ncontinual supervision and\nfinance.\nMy interpretation of these\nduties of the Committee was that\nthey could not be fulfilled\nwithout access to the accounts\u2014\nespecially with the word \"fin-ance\" appearing twice.\nYours sincerely\nRoy Francis.\nMary Freeman\nDear Sir\nAs an ex-student who took a keen interest in the workings of\nthe Union, may I offer a few!\ncomments on the resignation of\nMary Freeman. While the short\nterm effect\u2014an increase workload on the President and the\npermanent staff\u2014may appear to\nbe of no real concern to the\n'average' student, the long-term\neffects are. While clubs, societies,\netc, depend, in the short-term,\non the enthusiasm of their\nmembers, some areas of Union\nactivity (eg the allocation of the\nICU grant from College, in sur ance) need to be centrally administered (whether this is by\nsabbaticals or permanent staff is\nanother question).\nMary Freeman, was according\nto London Student, elected on a 'breath of fresh air' platform,\nPage 61\nimplying that by having a sabbatical who, in some way,\nwas not part of 'the system', the\nUnion could be run in a way that\nwould prove more satisfactory\nto its members. I would criticise\nthis idea on two grounds: firstly,\nI disagree that ideas are 'fresher'\nfor having been developed outside the system (or that they\nmust be staler for having been\nproduced 'inside') and, secondly,\nbecause this idea fails to recognise the reality of a bureaucratic\norganisation such as IC inevitably is. Anyone who has ever\ntaken part in a committee meeting will realise that discussions are far from being dispassionate and objective but,\nespecially when the members\npresent are there to represent a particular interest or viewpoint\n(as occurs on ICU Council for\nexample), discussions can sometimes degenerate to the\npoint where they become attacks\non individuals and not the issues\ninvolved, as anyone who has\nheard a debate in Parliament will\nknow.\nTo sum up, I would say to\nanyone considering standing for\na sabbatical post\u2014be sure to\ndevelop a thick ish skin, and to\npeople voting\u2014you would not\nchoose someone who said that\nthey had never seen a newspaper\nto be the next FELIX Editor.\nYours\nR Morgan\nCollege Security\nDear Martin\nAs residents of one of the\nHead Tenancy flats in Hamlet\nGardens, we wish to draw the\nattention of your readers to the\ndisturbing discovery we have\nmade.\nBy chance, we have found\nthat keys to at least two other\nflats in Hamlet Gardens (one of\nwhich is not a student flat)\nunlock our front door; and that\nour key unlocks at least one\nother flat.\nWhen we visited the Student\nManager for the flats, Mr James\nDonaldson, to request a new\nlock, we were told that it was\nvery unlikely that anything\ncould be done about it in the\nnear future, and that we would\nbe heavily fined if we fitted a new lock ourselves.\nWe protest very strongly\nabout this unsatisfactory state of\naffairs.\nYours\nResidents of Hamlet Gardens\n(Names withheld for obvious\nreasons.)\nBo Belle\nDear Mr Taylor\nI was appalled at last week's article concerning myself written\nby Mr Greenstreet. I found it to\nbe an insulting travesty of the\ntruth.\nI was amazed at the 'gentle-man's' extra-sensory powers of\nperception in making such astute\ncomments about Bo-Belle. Just\nas well that Mr Nathan and Mr\nStein were unavailable for\ncomment, otherwise they would\nhave been branded as 'hunk y Mr\nUniverse men' who had for\nweeks been 'wowing the lasses of\nRCS'.\nAs you are obviously unaware,\nGuilds and Guildsheet are nonsexist organisations unlike\nyourselves.\nI remain, sir, the 1982 BoBelle selected by open and fair\ncompetition based purely on the\nknowledge of Bo!\nYours disappointed ly Miss Miranda Bellchambers\nDear Sir\nI am writing to you concerning\nthe inaccurate ideas portrayed\nby the 'Bo Belle' news item.\nTo begin with the article\nappears to be a protest on\nMiranda's behalf for not being\nable to travel in Bo to Brighton.\nConsidering that although disappointed she accepted the\nreason why this could not be so\nand that this article presents her\nas a sex symbol and not as a young lady engineer keen to\nencourage more interest in Bo.\nFor these reasons I am in no\ndoubt as to the em baras s ment this article must have caused\nMiranda and I hope Phil Greenstreet has the courtesy to\napologise.\nMy other concern is the\nreference to the four seater car\nbeing full of Guilds hacks. Phil\nobviously knows little about the\ncar and the facts concerning\nthose who travel in him. Bo is in\nfact a five seater but due to his\nage only four people travel in\nhim on a long journey such as.\nthat to Brighton. Two of these\nseats are taken by driver and cod river and a third by the\nPresident of C&G Union for\nwhom Bo is official transport.\nThe fourth place officially belongs to Sir Hugh Ford in\nwhose name the ownership of\nthe car is registered. If he should\ndecide not to travel in the car\nthen it is up to the discretion of\nthe driver to decide who else\nshould travel in the car. Generally this person is someone\nwho has knowledge of and\nexperience with the mechanics\nand electrics of the car should\nsuch expertise be required in the\nevent of a breakdown.\nYours factually\nNigel Simmonds\nDear Sir\nI take exception to the small\nmisleading parts of Mr Greenstreet's article on 'Bo Belle': 'full\nof Guilds hacks'. To concede the\nonly possible fragment of truth I myself was one of the four;\nhence possibly one seat was\noccupied by a 'hack'. Though it\nshould not be surprising or\nobjectionable that the President\ntravels on Bo; as with all the\nmotorised mascots he is the\nPresident's official transport.\nThe other three seats were\noccupied by: the Bo Driver, this\nis a skilled job and cannot be\nsubstituted; the Co-Driver, it is\nnecessary for someone with\nexperience as Bo needs two\npeople to drive him. On the\nBrighton Run two Co-Drivers\nwere used, to involve more\npeople; the mechanic, any\ncomplaints?\nApart from myself the other\nfour people could not be considered hacks, their involvement\nand resulting trip to Brighton is\nbased on the long hours they\nspend Working on Bo, and the\nexpertise they possess. I would\nprefer articles in the new look\nand large edition of FELIX to\nrefrain from personal colouration s except where applicable:\neditorials, Below the Belt, Soap\nBox, etc.\nYours faithfully\nS Bishop\nPresident C& GU1982/3 The President's Hat\nNovember 12,19821\nDear Sirs\nI wish to point out the\nfollowing referring to your\nBelow The Belt column of last\nweek concerning the hat.\n1. I was not at the time of the\nincident, wearing the now grey\nhat. My (unnamed) lady friend was.\n2. We (my lady friend and I) were not hiding in a shop\ndoorway but we were standing\non the pavement of Earls Court\nRoad heading towards Cromwell\nRoad having just passed two\nofficers of the Met, when the\nincident occurred.\nI hope (we hope) that this will\nsur press any malicious rumours\nabout me and the unnamed Miss\n.X.

    "content": "Biochemistry Society\nLast week FELIX printed a story about the Biochemistry\ndepartment under the headline\n'We've been ripped off!' Complaints about this article were\nreceived from senior staff in the\nBiochemistry department, from\nthe Biochemical Society and\nfrom R CSU, and in view of\nthese, some explanation is\nneeded.\nThe article was criticised as\nfactually inaccurate, both by\nKarl Schmidt and Chas Fuller of\nR CSU who complained that 'a lot of the facts were incorrect'\nand by Dr Dickerson in the\ndepartment who described the\narticle as 'almost wholly er-ro neo us'. Mr Schmidt in his letter\nquotes FELIX as saying '...with-out the combined funding,( Bio chem Soc) would have\noverrun their budget by Christmas' and goes on to say 'This is\ngrossly incorrect, as will be\nverified by either Chris Bruton\nR CSU Senior Treasurer or Tony\nLai President of Biochem Soc'\nTony Lai was our original\nsource, so we checked with him\nand he agreed that, while it was\ndifficult to be precise about\nhypothetical future financial\ndealings, the facts as reported\nwere broadly correct.\nDr Barnard, Head of the\nBiochemistry Department states\nin his letter that '. . . (the\ndepartment) has never, in the\npast two years or at any other\ntime,...required our postgraduates to attend...lectures provided by R CSU.' Yet a letter\ncirculated by Dr Dickerson to\npostgraduates two years ago\nstates 'All graduate students are\nexpected to attend...the IC\nBiochemical Society lectures.\nQuestions on these may be put\nto the student...at the PhD oral\nexamination'. Dr Dickerson has\nsince told FELIX that this\ndemand was orally withdrawn\nsix months after the letter was\nissued (although several post-grads we questioned seemed\nunaware of the fact); this was\n\u2022 done in response to a complaint\nby one Nick Morton, ex-ICU\nPresident.\nWhen FELIX stated that 'for\nthe last two years lectures\narranged with R CSU funds have\nbeen used as part of post-graduates' exam in able course'\nwe were taking information from Dr Dicker son's( still\ncurrent) letter; we had no way of\nknowing that the offensive\nclause had been orally with-drawn. But nevertheless, in view\nof the initial six months, Dr Barnard's letter is shown to be\nincorrect.\nFELIX l \u2014 \u2014 H^ \u2014\nEDITORIAL\nApart from this, though, no\none has indicated any errors of\nfact in the article at all.\nThe other criticism levelled at\nFELIX was that the wording of\nthe article endorsed the (in-core ct) ideas exposed in RCSU's Broadsheet. This criticism is to\nsome extent justified, and we\napologise to all those who felt\nthat the negotiations between\nR CSU and the department were\nprejudiced because of what was\nwritten. It is going too far,\nthough, to suggest as Karl Schmidt does that FELIX is\nlowering its standards to that of\nThe Sun or even (heaven forbid)\nThe Daily Telegraph. The point is\nworthy of some comment under\na new heading.\nFELIX and The Sun\nFELIX caters for Imperial\nCollege students, who are, by\nand large, of above average\nintelligence. We therefore try to\nwrite articles intelligently, coherently and straightforward-ly, sticking to established fact as\nfar as possible, and attempting\nto maintain a style which combines interest with the\ndignity of clear, concise English.\nWith a news staff of one and\nmuch of the important news\nhappening on Thursday lunch-times, this is difficult, but we do\nour best. If anyone feels that\nFELIX does read like The Sun, I suggest they firstly compare the\ntwo papers' style a little more\ncarefully, and consider how we\ncould write up some of our news\nif we tried, ('It was a red-letter\nday for top IC boss Lord F when\nhe got the plum job on the\ncollege bosses' committee') and\nsecondly that they join the news\nstaff and try to change things. It\nis not stooping to sensationalism\nwhen we report on various\npersons' or organisations' misdeeds ('exposure' is the\ntabloid ese for this) provided, of\ncourse that we get our facts\nright.\nThere are exceptions. We\noccasionally deliberately parody\nThe Sun, as we did last week with\nthe ' Bo Belle' article. More importantly, in our headlines we\ntend to less formality than\nserious national papers, and for\na variety of good reasons. Firstly,\nwe feel the average student\nprefers a succinct and witty\nheadline to a longer, more\ndetailed one. ' NO FLOWERS BY REQUEST' is more fun than\n' U GM refuses to buy Mary Freeman roses as parting ges-ture'. Secondly, when the news\nisn't exactly earth-shattering\n(and it frequently isn't)a longer,\nserious headline appears unbearably pompous and dry.\n' WHERE WERE YOU?' puts\nmuch more interest into a dull\nstory than ' U GM Inquorate\nAgain'. Thirdly, the purpose of a headline in, say, The Times, is to\nbriefly inform you of the point\nof the story so that you can\nchoose whether to read the\ndetails. In FELIX there are only\na dozen or so news stories at\nmost, and nearly everyone will\nread all of them anyway. Fourthly \u2022\nand lastly there is the visual\nargument. FELIX( and The Sun)\nhave small pages\u2014that's what\n'tabloid' means\u2014and to take up\nspace with longer, serious\nheadlines in smaller print looks\nridiculous.\nBut apart from' splash' banner headlines, we do seriously\ntry to report the news in an\nintelligent and concise manner\nwhich will appeal to the readership of a university newspaper,\nand we resent allegations that\nFELIX reads like a newspaper\ndesigned to appeal to people\nwith lazy minds who appreciate\nemotional phrasing of the news.\nIn general, we succeed in these\naims, but if you disagree there's plenty of room on the news staff.\nBar Accounts\n(Second Canto)\nAs the U GM motion is carried\non Tuesday instructing the Exec\nactively to campaign for open\nbar accounts, more people are\ntaking sides, and taking them\nmore vehemently, and an interesting distinction is becoming\napparent. People such as Stephen\nGoulder, Dr Bob Schroter, and\nKarl Schmidt, who have access\nto the accounts, want to keep\nthem secret. ( Mr Schmidt, although he does not have direct\naccess to the figures, claims to\nwant them withheld because he\nhas 'discovered the main trends\nthrough discreet enquiries').\nPeople who do not have access\nto the accounts, such as Deputy\nPresident John McCallion, Honorary Secretary Andy Grimshaw, myself, and, in view\nof last Tuesday's vote, the\nelectorate at aUG M, are all\n'seeking either open accounts or\na sensible reason for withholding\nthem. It is particularly ridiculous\nnot to show Mr McCallion the\naccount, since as a student\nrepresentative on the Bar Subcommittee he has to advise\nthe Refectories Committee on\nmatters of finance. How they\ncan expect this without showing\nhim the accounts defies ex plan a tion.\nBut do they expect this? What\nare the Bar Subcommittee's duties as outlined in the Terms\nof Reference? Stephen Goulder\nNovember 12, 1982\nand Roy Francis disagreed when\nthey were questioned( not\nsurprisingly) and each insisted\nhe was right and the Terms of\nReference supported his view-point. One man's word against\nanother, so they were asked to\ncheck exactly how the Terms\nwere worded. Unfortunately each has a different copy of the\nTerms of Reference worded in\njust such a way as to support his\nown viewpoint\nBut Mr Gould er's' official position on the matter is quite\ninteresting, too. The motion\ncarried at Tuesday's U GM instructs the Union Council to\nensure that its nominees to\nCollege committees will campaign for open bar accounts as\nMr Goulder has been quick to\npoint out, the Union representatives on the Subcommittee are\nJohn McCallion and John Passmore. As an appointee of\nthe Refectories Committee, he\nsays, he himself is not a student\n\"representative. Is this why he is\nnot representing the students'\nviews?\nMeanwhile the excuses from\nthe closed a counts lobby get\nsillier and more desperate: 'Open\nbar accounts will make it too\nobvious if the bar staff aren't working efficiently' or 'Why ask\nabout bars anyway? Wouldn't it\nbe better to start with re fec tories?'\nNo, the longer Dr Schroter\nand Mr Gould er keep the\naccounts secret, the more it will\nmake people wonder what is\nbeing covered up. Certain rumour mongers are already\nalleging specific irregularities,\nand the only way to stem their\ngossip is to publish the accounts. -Unless, of course, there is\nsomething which the public mustn't discover.\nFELIX Dinner\nThe ad with all the details is on\npage 2, but the most important\ndetail is missing, namely that\neveryone is welcome, not just\nFELIX hacks.\nFeature Articles\nThere are ideas and invitations\nin abundance for FELIX feature\narticles. How would you bike\nto...make a parachute jump, fly\nin a balloon, be shown round the\nlaser i um camera, test commercial sex aids...? All these and\nmore (at the expense of the\ncompanies concerned) to anyone\nwho will write an article about\nthe experience for FELIX. Applications to the FELIX Editor, any Monday or Friday.\nImpossible Without\nAll the people who usually help,\nand also John Lyle who came to\nmend the folding machine so\npromptly.\nHn HBR Hi PageS "

During the week we ate a lot of\ngrilled food, tried to drink yards\nof fizzy Yugoslav beer(?) and\nplayed three matches all of\nwhich were lost: 11-2, 13-7,12-2.\nThe first two were against Red\nStar, Belgrade Juniors, and the\nfinal match was versus the local\nside who actually charged\nspectators admission. We returned to the rain of London\nspending six hours in Zagrab\nairport rest camp on the way\nhaving had more than enough of\nYugoslavian airport officials.\nMany thanks to Richard for\norganising everything. This term\nwe have had two matches in the\nMiddlesex League, both against\nPenguin 3. The first of these was\nwon 10-8 despite some very\nscrappy play by almost everyone.\nA week later however, Penguin\nemerged with a much stronger\nteam to meet ours' which was\ndepleted due to absentees. We\nlost the ensuing farce 10-2, but\nwe have since found that we\nhave won the league this year\nanyway. Future events are the\nUL U swimming competition on\nNovember15 and the UL U Water Polo knockout (which we\nwon last year). Anyone interested in playing polo or swimming should come along to the\npool in Princes Gardens at\n6:30pm on Mondays or Fridays.\nSnooker\nThree matches were played this\nweek. IC A team drew 6-6 with\nthe G&J Club in the Shipping\nCompanies LEague, Davis and\nJennings each winning two\nframes to make up for the earlier\nlapses by Hurford and Gaskill.,\n. In the UL U League, Paul\nHolt's powerful B team crushed\nQM C by four frames to one.\nStar of the show as the semi-paralytic Barry Franklin whose'\nappearance attracted a larger\nthan average crowd. Holt, Thomason and Powell won their\nframes with some ease, but the\nconsistent Lawrence lost.\nThe C team was less successful\nagainst the same QM C opponents,~ with only Grind all managing to win a frame.\nHowever, there was an encouraging display from Gardener,\nand Kenny Jarrett added a bit of\ncolour to the occasion, if\nnothing else.\nFinally, don't forget the Pot\nLuck Doubles tournament this\nDunday, starting at 12:00 noon.\nAlso, entries are invited to the\nopen and handicap tournaments\n\u2014details in the Snooker Room.\nNew match-sec Gordon Bowser\nexperienced considerable difficulties getting home since\nsomeone had in considerably built an exhibition hall in the\nmiddle of the road.

Rifle & Pistol Q Hockey\nThe club editorial board apologise profoundly for the absence\nof last week's epic literary\ninstallment. Incidents un reported include a tough shoulder-to-shoulder match against Middlesex Hospitals, won narrowly by\n1128 to 964. Star performances\nincluded 197 from Noel and 195\nfrom Geoff. Notable failures\n,were Club Captain Steve Harrison (contact via the Elec Eng\nletter-racks) who notched up\n178, thus being eliminated again.\nAfterwards the club held its first\never bender featuring Tim and\nGary in a tight point-for-point\n(first one to 40) competition.\nGlamour was added to the\noccasion by the delectable Julia\nwho held Jonathan spellbound.\nFirsts\nDing ding.\nRound 1: Sharpe is starting\nwell with some good strikes to\nthe mid body. But the ogre is\nfighting back and...yes. First\nblood to him with a neat weave\nand kick on the left knee, and\nboth ankles given 'the treat-ment'. Imperial supporting well.\nDong dong.\nRound 2: And Sharpe comes\nstraight out to the ogre with\nanother couple of ankle jobs (as\nonly he knows how) with a quick\nneed in the kidneys and stick in\nthe chest. But wait. A free hit to\nImperial and Sharpe really takes\nadvantage of this one. Ducking\nand weaving round his opponent\nwho's resorted to swearing.\nApparently Sharpe's going to\n'lose his block'. If he does that\nagain.\nDing ding.\nOh and did you see that!\nSharpe upended whilst the\numpire was looking the other\nway. Not seen! Real aggression\nas Imperial strike twice more:\nand the Ogre's submitted.\nIC vs Old Greightonians\nIt's been well over a year since\nthe first have won a Saturday\nleague game. However morale\nwas high as we left a quaint little\npub half a mile from the ground'\nhaving administered Franklin\nwith his medicinal pre-match\nGuin nes( or two). Unfortunately the captain arrived late at\nthe ground and had to start the\ngame 'dry'\u2014maybe there's still\nhope for the firsts.\nThe ground was, as last year,\nterrible but Imperial played well.\nAfter a tentative start good\nrunning at the midfield and\nconstructive use of the wings left\nthe 'cretins' on the receiving end\nof many good moves although\nthe forwards failed to convert\nmany tok goals. Good defensive\nwork by Tony and Andy at the\nback gave the team a good base\non which to build our game. A handful of short corners were,\nonce again, wasted (we most\nwork on that), but Imperial\nfinished the game two deserved\ngoals ahead.\nIC vs Middlesex Hosp 6-0\nAnother victory. What on earth\nis going on? Last year we\nstruggled against them, and this\nyear...well four goals in the first\nfifteen minutes squashed what\nlittle pride they might have had,\nwith even Peter 'Rapier' Sharp\nshowing the potential for (dare I say it) stick work.\nThey were large and determined but four swift attacks\nfrom the initial whistle gave\nImperial two lousy goals and\ntwo 'b under s'. We then eased off\nallowing Middlesex more of the\npossession although they never\nlooked like scoring. Imperial,\nplaying a man short, were\nwithout a right wing, but\nMiddlesex never capitalised on\nthis weakness and left right\nmidfield Bell the run of the\npitch. In the second half two\nmore goals were neatly slotted\nby a bemused 'Sex' goalie\nleaving a frustrated Middlesex\nteam.\nTeam: your favourites.\nINoVember 12, 19821 IFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Biochem Lectures: Who's Paying?\nImpartiality in\nFELIX News\nDear Sir\nRegarding your report on last\nweek's Debating Society motion\nto abolish private education:\nYour correspondent uses the\nphrase \" Sir Ashley (the pro-poser) betrayed his position as\nsocialist chairman of the GLC in\nan attack on Conservative Government educational policies.\" My own impression was that\nSir Ashley's well argued attack\n(on this government's appallingly\nshort-sighted, ill-considered, and\nmethodical destruction of Britain's education system at all\nlevels) did in fact honour and\ncredit Sir Ashley's position as\nChairman of the GLC.( The\nGLC is, inter alia, charged with\nproviding education for residents\nof Inner London.) Perhaps your\ncorrespondent has 'betrayed' his\nposition as a' reactionary capitalist bent on defending privilege, and lowering standards\nof education' (and of journalism\nas well, if that is possible!).\nIam aware of FELIX' s shortage of reporters and stringers\n(and that there is no tradition of\nimpartiality in the British press!), but I wonder if you could include, if not a full byline,\nthen at least the initials of those\nresponsible for each item. Even\nthe Daily Telegraph does not fill\nevery page with un attributable 'editorials'.\nYours at tri but ably Glyn Garside\nEE3 PS: For those who missed it, the\nmotion to abolish Private Education was carried by 36\nvotes to 24: there's hope for this\nplace yet!\nFrom the officers of Biochem Soc\nDear Editor\nWe are writing with regard to\nthe frontpage headline in FELIX November 5 issue in an\neffort to clarify the incorrect\ninformation published in the\narticle.\nFor the last few years, depart-mental lectures have been organised by the biochemistry\ndepartment in response to the\nsuggestion by the research councils ( MRC, SER C etc) that\npostgraduates should receive\nsome kind of formal training\noutwith their own specialised\nresearch projects. That is to say\nthe research councils( which fund post grads) are putting pressure on departments to have\npost grads attend advanced lecture courses and seminars to\nbe formally examined on them.\nThe department therefore initiated a series of lectures of which\nsix had to be attended (from a choice (i not many more).\nIn the past, lectures were\norganised without consultation\nwith the post grads, were poorly\nattended, often uninteresting and heavily criticised. The post grads' complaints were met\nthis year by the department's offering to match the R CSU support of the students' Biochemical Society; this would enable the Bio chem Soc to\norganise more lectures of greater\nvariety and interest than the\ndepartment ally organised ones.\nThis offer has been discussed by\nthis year's Biochem Soc committee and, although it was\nthought that more departmental\nmoney should be made available,\nwe decided to support the arrangement on an experimental\nbasis for this year.\nYours faithfully\nTony Lai( President)\nXi men a Mont a no(H on Sec)\nAndy Bateman (Treasurer)\nStephen Johnstone (Publicity)\nFrom the Head of the Bio chemistry Department\nDear Editor\nThe letter from all of the\nofficers of the Student Biochemical Society, which I have seen\nafter they sent it to you on their\nown initiative, is entirely correct\nand represents accurately the\nresults of the friendly discussion\nwe have been having with them\nover along period on the\nquestion of lectures for our postgraduate students. I need to\nadd two points not covered by\nthem, which I ask you to bring\nto your readers' attention by\nprinting this letter with theirs.\nFirstly, you relied extensively\non an article in the R CSU Broadsheet, which was itself wholly inaccurate. It is no defence for you to say that you\nmerely quoted another source,\nsince you appeared to state those\nclaims as facts, and since the\nPresident of our Student Bio chemical Society, Mr Tony Lai, told you on the telephone when\nyou enquired in advance that the\nclaims in the Broadsheet were\nentirely mistaken. Your article\nhas a paragraph that ne gins\" The department's defence is...\", but no reporter asked in\nadvance either myself or other\nacademic staff concerned what\nthis \" defence\" was, and the\nstatements printed as that \"defence\" give a garbled version,\nwith which this department would not associate itself. I feel\nthat before printing a front page\narticle under a sensational heading about being\" ripped off, you should have checked to\nfind that the story was false.\nSecondly, the statements made, apparently given as a fact,\nthat \"for the last two years,\nlectures arranged by the Biochemistry Society with funds from R CSU have been used as\npart of postgraduates' exam in able course\" and they are \"officially examined\" on them\nare false. It is correctly stated in\nthe letter from the Society' s officers that we did, for good\nreason, put forward a scheme for\nrequiring our postgraduates to\nattend six lectures. However, to\nmake it quite clear, I should\npoint out that we have never in\nthe past two years or at any\nother time, put this into effect\nfor the lectures funded by RC SU.I can state categorically\nthat no postgraduate has been\nrequired to attend any of the\nlatter lectures, nor do we have\nany arrangement to check whether they do so.\nWe did organise some of our\nown lectures, without reference\nto R CSU funds, as we are entitled to do. We have been\ntrying to bring our students into\nthe organisation of those that\nwill be required academically,\nrather than dictate to them, and\nI would have thought the\nStudents' Union generally would\napplaud this. We have been\nPage 41 i November12,19821 discussing a proposal for the\nfuture, but this attempt at\nstudent participation is not helped by unfounded claims about the past, about which they, and I, are now complain-ing.\nYours sincerely\nProfessor EA Barnard\nFrom the President of R CSU Dear Martin\nIn furtherance to your leading\narticle \"We've been ripped off!\"\nin FELIX no 626\u201e I write to\ncomplain that the only people\nthat have been ripped off were\nyour readers.\nFirstly, the article stated that\nfor the last two years the\nbiochemistry department had been using our Union funds.\nFact: For the past two years\nthere have been proposals for a joint venture in this area.\nSecondly, it said that without\nthe combined funding, the\nsociety would have had no money by Christmas. Again, this\nis grossly incorrect as will be\nverified by either Chris Bruton, RCS UH JT or Tony Lai, President of Biochem Soc. Nor has an\nR CSU officer complained to me\nabout the quality of the lectures\nand as for the matter being discussed at General Committee\nlast Monday, I was merely going\nto make a statement endorsing a decision taken at Gen Com m on\nMarch23, which said \"...This\nwould be acceptable if the\nsociety can still choose the\nlectures freely,\" which is going\nto be the case\u2014the Biochem\ndept are paying the Biochem Soc\nfor organising lectures of their\nbehalf.\nAs it was, we did discuss it on\nMonday and the Committee gave me permission to sign a document to that effect, with a few other conditions as well, one\nof which includes a review of the\nsituation at joint General Committee in May1983, where a decision shall be taken as to\nwhether or not we ought to\nextend the agreement. Yours\nGEK Schmidt\nR CSU President\nA letter was also received from Dr A Dickerson, Postgraduate\nTutor in the Biochemistry Department, which echoed the views of\nthe three letters above. This letter\nhas been omitted, and Karl\nSchmidt's letter slightly edited\n(with the permission of their\nrespective senders) for reasons of\nspace.

    "content": "The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nOPENING TIME!\nIC Union is to actively campaign\nfor more open bar accounts,\nfollowing a motion that was\ncarried at Tuesday's Union General Meeting. The motion\nalso instructed the Union to\noppose the changes that would\nallegedly weaken student representation on the Bar Committee,\nand to remove any ICU representatives to the Refectory and\nBar Committee deemed not to be\nrepresenting the students' beliefs.\nThe motion stems from the\nreaction to Roy Francis' s removal from the Bar Subcommittee where he held the post of\nsecretary. Mr Francis, who had\nImade himself unpopular by 'campaigning for a less secretive\nattitude towards bar accounts,\nwas dismissed by the Academic\nStaff Assembly which was reviewing its representation on\nvarious committees. The subsequent publicity in FELIX over\nthe last two weeks created some\ninterest in the motion, and although the meeting was in quo rate, quorum was not called until after the vote.\nColin Cooper proposed the\nmotion, quoting verbatim long\nextracts from the minutes of bar\ncommittee meetings. In opp osi tion, Stephen Gould er( who is at\npresent the subcommittee's chairman) denounced the whole\nmotion as 'absolute fiction and\nmeaningful hogwash'. Heclaimed\nthat so long as he remains Chairman of the Ba r Committee\nand is allowed to see the accounts, the Union's interests\nare sufficiently well represented.\nDuring Mr Cooper's summing up speech, the U GM Chairman Nick Pyne was several\ntimes forced to silence Mr Gould er's interruptions, but\norder was maintained until the\nmotion was carried by a large\nmajority.\nEarlier on, the meeting had\nelected Hugh Southey ( FELIX' s What'sOn co-or d in at or) to the\npost of Alternative Prospectus\nEditor. No nominations were\nreceived for the post of Union Publicity Officer, and reports\nfrom various Union officers\nwere received. However, after an\nobvious show of potential boredom from Nick Pyne, the\nmeeting refused to allow Jon Barnett, the Welfare Officer, to\ngive his report.\nCheerio Chas! RCSU Hon Sec\nChas Fuller tests the waters of the\nRound Pond after the RCS UGM.\nGuilty!\nMike Bartlett, Jo Claydon and\nDave Mitchell, three City and\nGuilds Union officers, were today\ncovered in treacle, feathers and\nshaving foam as punishment for\nlosing Reggie, Kings College's mascot, after the Freshers' U GM. Despite pleas of innocence\nfrom the three and also Frank\nRowsell, defense counsel, the\neloquence of Steve Bishop, Guild's Union President, as he\ncondemned Jo from luring Mr Bartlett and Mr Mitchell from\ntheir duty and persuading them\nto take round parties of fresher s, persuaded the jury of twelve\nGuilds men to find the accused\nguilty.\nThe verdict delighted the\ngathered masses as did the\njudge's sentence which was carried out despite repeated attempts by the guilty union\nofficers to escape.\nNo. 6271\nTreacled. and feathered\nH Friday, November 12, 1982 WHOM\nNo Dinners?\nFollowing Thursday's City and\nGuilds Union General Meeting, it\nis possible that City and Guilds\ndepartments will not have formal\nfresher s' dinners next year.\nThe result of the much amended motion which was passed at\nthe U GM, is that Guilds' General Committee has been\ninstructed to work out next\nyear's events taking as its starting point Guilds' policy to\nhave no more fresher s' dinners\nin their current form.\nThis motion resulted from the\nElectrical Engineering depart-ment's fresher s' dinner at which less than fifty people turned up.\nBiochemsoc\nR CSU have agreed to accept the\nBiochemistry Department's offer of matching the Union's contribution to Bio chem soc's funds, in return for which the\nDepartment will strongly en courage- its postgraduate students to attend lectures organised\n'by the Society.\nStrong criticism was levelled\nat FELIX over last week's headline article on this subject;\nletters from relevant bodies and Editorial comment are on pages\n4 and5 respectively.\nWkWkWmWkWkWkWMTM\n\n"

Eventually IC settled down and ran the ball\nwell, though concentration lacked at times and resulted in a few dropped passes and missed\ntackles.

    "content": "WALKABOUTLOOKSE\u00a3\nby Mobile Optics lac \"\nOne of the very great pleasures of the\nNational Gallery is that the collection there is\nsuch a superb one. Unfortunately, that is also\nits great drawback. You are almost bound to\nknow the pictures, from mediocre reproductions the size of postage stamps\u2014seeing\nthem 'in the flesh' may force you to rethink\nsome cherished preconceptions; and, being\none of London's major tourist attractions, it is\njam-packed full of conducted tours which\nsurge round in disordered fashion, en route\nfrom the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey!\nThe day I was there, the Gallery was full of\nRussians; they were all wearing bright group\nbadges, were being counted in and out of each\nroom by solidly-built 'guides' and were to be\nescorted back to the South C<> ast, to spend\nthe night on their ship...the temptation to\ndefect apparently becomes harder to resist the\nlonger one is exposed to Capitalist city life.\nStanding in Trafalgar Square with your back\nto Nelson's Column and Whitehall, the National Gallery occupies the north side-of the\nsquare and, today, looks very much as it did\nwhen first opened to the public on April 9 1938.\nExtensions have since been added behind the\noriginal building; the first in 1876, designed by\nEM Barry, architect of the Royal Opera\nHouse, Covent Garden. Currently, an extension to the west of the original building is\nplanned, and will occupy what is now an N CP car park.\nBritain's Golden Age\nToday, the Tate houses the National Collection of British Painting; since 1946 more\nthan 300 pictures, previously at the National\nGallery, have been transferred there. The\npictures of the British School which remain in\nTrafalgar Square are almost all of the great\nperiod, the century and a quarter that lies\nbetween the first works of Hogarth and the last\nof Turner.\nThroughout the 18th Century a growing\nclass of wealthy and cultured people created a demand for portraiture. This was the age of\nGarrick and Dr Johnson, of peace and prosperity under the reigns of the Hanoverian\nGeorges, the age which saw the birth of the\nRomantic movement. Thomas Gainsborough\n(1727-1788) was not only a highly successful\nportrait-painter, but an excellent, romantic\nlandscape painter\u2014a form which he himself\npreferred. In Room 39 hangs Gainsborough's joint portrait of ' Mr and Mrs Andrews.' It is a superb combination of landscape and portraiture. Mr Andrews looks serious, but is a little smug: his pretty wife and his fine estate\nare pictured together for all to admire. The\ncouple is young and unsophisticated. Gainsborough' s obvious sympathy for his\nsubject makes it a very charming picture.\nQuite different is his style in the portrait of\nMrs Siddons in Room38. Gainsborough painted the actress in 1785, in a rich, expressive manner. She is elegantly dressed;\nher clear, powdered skin and smooth shining\nsilk dress contrast with the dark, glowing\nbackground and with the fluffy textures of hair,\nfur and feathers. She is not a classic beauty\n(her nose is too long!) but is compelling, and\nembodies all the grace and apparent ease of\nthe 18th Century.\nA couple of steps from Mrs Siddons, but\nsocially all the way to the East End, is\nHogarth's 'Shrimp Girl'. Her smile, under the\nbroad basket piled with shrimps and measuring cup, is delightful. The sketching is\nvivacious, and what the face lacks in firmness\nand solidity is more than made up for by its\nanimation.\nMaria Ana de Pontejos ,\nThe Marquesa de Pontejos, by Franciso de\nGoya(17461828), is on view in Room 41.\nWhat is interesting about this picture of the\nSpanish School, is that Goya' s style of\nfashionable portraiture is very reminiscent of\nGainsboroughs. Goya painted the Marquesa\nin about 1786 with an idyllic landscape as a backdrop. However, unlike Mr and Mrs Andrews, she does not belong in her setting\nand stands rather stiffly, showing-off her\nfashion-plate clothes.\nThe National Gallery has provided a good\nsheet of background blurb about each picture,\nwhich you can pick up in Room 41.\nWhere? When? \u00a3?\nThe National Gallery, Trafalgar Sq WC2 is\nopen MonS at106 pm, Sun26 pm. The Marquesa de Ponte jos is on show until\nDecember 31. It's free!\nPINCCCMIO\nPerola's Puzzle\nAs you may have noticed, last week saw the\ntimely demise of the folding machine. That,\nhowever, was the least of our problems! The\nprinting machine was upset by a gremlin, and\nmany of the sixteen pages were printed in the\nwrong positions, so that the page numbers\nwere all mixed.\nThe first person to notice this was Andy\nMann, who had been taking the pages from the\nfolding machine while it was still working.\n\"Each sheet has been folded like this,\" he said,\nholding up a page as in the diagram: A,B,C and D are the page numbers. \"In every case,\nthe page numbers are arranged in ascending\norder; that is, A< B<C<D, each page number\nhas been printed exactly once, and the\nnumbers on any one sheet add up to 34, as\nusual.\"\n' \" Ah. yes,\" said the Editor MST( Mildly\nShocked Team-leader) when he spotted the\nmistake, \"but there are no two consecutive\nnumbers on any sheet, in any position, not\neven in the wrong places! Fortunately the front\npage, back page and editorial (page 5) are in\nthe right positions, so perhaps nobody will\nnotice.\"\n\"If we weren't just about to distribute this, I could use this as a puzzle,\" I said, \"although I'd have to add that on the sheet with the editorial,\nno one page number is twice another.\"\nLuckily, at this point the matter was put\nright by a magician who just happened to be\nhanging around the office ( although he\ncouldn't do anything with the folding machine!)\nso I have set this as a puzzle\u2014what was the\noriginal order of the pages?\nI am indebted for this little gem of a puzzle to\nmy good friend Perola, who has also given me\na puzzle that you're going to be faced with\nwhen I feel evil enough.\nSolutions, comments,criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. \u00a35 from\nMend-a Bike and an evening out with the\nfolding machine (special prize!) for randomly\nselected entry.\nLast Week's Solution\nAlright, I admit it! There were several\ncorrect solutions to last week's puzzle and\nhere's the proof of those solutions:\nIf we take the two abaci shown, which show\n364 and 561, and let x,y, x' and y' represent\nthe number of spare balls on the rungs shown,\nany spare on the top rung being irrelevant,\nthen equating the numbers on the abaci,\n3 (6 + x+1)(4+ y+1)+6(4+y+1)+4=5(6+ x'+1)(1+ y'+1)+6(1+y'+1)+13(7+ x)(5+ y)+6(5+y)+3=5(7+ x')(2+ y')+6(2+y')105+15 x+21y+3 xy+30+6 y+3=70+i Ox'+35y'+5 x' y'+12+6y'10 x'15x+41y'27 y+5 x'y'3 xy=56 which is solved by:\nx=y=0; x'=y'=1; no. = 139\nx=1,y=0, x'=2,y'=1; no. = 154\nx=2,y=0, x'=3,y'=1; no. = \"169\nx=3,y=2, x'=2,y'=3; no. = 256\nx=x'=0,y= y'=4; no. = 247\nThere were only two people who found all\nfive solutions; the winner chosen was PG Bevan of Me ch Eng 1, but commiserations to\nLeann Jones of Maths 2, the unlucky loser. PG Bevan can collect the \u00a35 cheque after\n1:30pm on Monday.\nHopefully, the solution to this week's puzzle\nis unique, and I have checked it (but then\nagain, I thought I'd checked last weeks!).\nCheques are still awaiting collection from\nthe FELIX Office by the following prize\nwinners: Ken Morrison, Sandra Gould and\nSong Fu.

Problems were com* pounded for the crew by torrential rain, but despite this, running\nrepairs were carried out and Bo arrived in Brighton to be\ngreeted by a band of cheering\nGuildsmen who had come down to greet his arrival.\nOut for the\nCount\nDuncan Batty\n.and Jez\nDuncan Batty of R CSU Motor Club was taken to hospital last\nSunday night after a heavy drinking session in the Union Bar. He had been working very\nhard on Jez over the previous\nweek in order to get her ready\nfor the London to Brighton run, and after a wedding reception on Saturday (at which a considerable quantity of alcohol was\nconsumed) Mr Batty only had ,\nforty minutes sleep before he j accompanied Jez to Brighton on the Sunday. On returning to\nLondon he joined in a drinking\nsession where he collapsed and\nwas taken to hospital. He was\ndischarged after a matter of hours when he had had some\nrest and sobered up.\nINovember 12, 19821 IPage3\n\n"
