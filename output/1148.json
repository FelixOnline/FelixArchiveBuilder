    "content": "Music 7 June 1999\nAlbums\nINDIAN ROPEMAN\nElephant Sound\nREMY ZERO\nVilla Elaine\nIndian Ropeman. Same label as Norman, you know.\nW ell this is a rather quiet release\nfrom the same stable, Skint,\nthat brings you all of your\ncherished and much hyped fatBoy Slim\nreleases. However, it is obvious from\nthe first that Indian Ropeman is without\nthe constraints that the fat one's seeming Adidas sponsorship brings.\nElephant Sound, although I am still trying to find one on the album, instantly\ncomes racing out at you like a champion stallion. The first track. Chairman of\nthe Board, is a booming, dark tune with\nthe excellent, pre-requisite vocal sam-ple, full of self-belief and adulation.\nAnd as not to disappoint, with a moniker like Indian Ropeman, the tune\nis laced with an eerie Asian vocal\nmelody. In fact, the whole album has as\nethnic a feel as a Big Beat album can\nhave.\nNow as far as I am concerned Big\nBeat is solely a preserve of the dance\nfloor. Alright, I admit it, it is good for\nthose preparatory early Friday nights,\ngetting you in the mood for a hard\nnight's clubbing, but more than that?\nOh yeah, I almost forgot, as Fat Boy Slim\nand now Bentley Rhythm Ace have\nfound, it is also excellent advert music!\nFor me, Big Beat is throwaway music.\nThe Fast Food of dance, instantly accessible, rarely memorable and often\naccompanied with a whole load of limp\nlettuce and nasty gherkins to bulk it up!\nUnfortunately, it is close to this territory that Indian Ropeman's Elephant\nSound lies. The tracks have all the Skint\nhallmarks: phat, p harty bass lines and naturally that big drum beat. But it is not the\ndance floor fillers that make your ears\njump for joy on Elephant Sound. No,\nIndian Ropeman's quirky excellence is\nbest demonstrated on the slower, more\nfunky little numbers, of which there are\nquite a few on the album. These include\nan interesting cover of Sunshine Of Your\nLove; so deep and dark it's almost at the\npoint of being drum n' bass, Do Not\nDeviate From Your Course and the excellently live sounding Your Own Enemy,\nwhich could be a NinjaTune release.\nIndian Ropeman's album is not bad\nat all, although nothing astounds you\nenough to call for the rewind. This breed\nof Big Beat is a little older and more\ncomplex than that employed by others.\nThe ethnic sounds and darker melodies\ncontribute an added dimension to a genre that can be so featureless. Getting\nback to the Fast Food analogy Elephant\nSound is more like a decent take-away\ncurry than a nasty commercial burger.\nNot too bad, that is if you don't mind\nwhat it does to your bowels the next\nmorning! B Ramzi\nTRINA & TAMARA\nTrina & Tamara \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nWe all know very well that chart-successful boy-bands sing\nnothing but love songs and\ntheir success Is likely to be attributed to\nthis, along with their compulsory boyish looks of course. In the same respect,\nyou could say that r&b bands sing mainly about sex and steamy foreplay and\nthat it's of black origin. This is all true\nwith Trina & Tamara.\nT&T draw a fine line between gospel\nand r&b, so although they do go all out\nwith saying things like 'Joanne, Joanne,\nstop trying to fuck my man' on Joanne,\nthey also sing Almost a capella and slow,\nwhich sounds like something that Eternal would sing. Speaking of Eternal, I preferred their debut material much more\nthan the gospel they became so passionate about with their later albums.\nLuckily, T&T features little of this and contains some fine r&b. The opening track, What'd You Came\nHere For, sets the standard: stylish and\ngood fun. Judging by the vocals T&T sound quite young - not quite as young\nas Madonna's sign-up Cleopatra, but also\nnot quite as mature as Mary J. Blige.\nNevertheless, they produce a harmonious sound and the beats are always\nthere to show it off. At times though, the\nmusic needs to project the vocals rather\nthan being left for us to pick out.\nThe melody in Nothin' New, and\nmany other tracks, is so fresh. The sexy\nkeyboard loop is brilliant and the vocals\nare Inevitably smooth.\nGiven that r&b is slowly getting more\nand more chart-attention, due to artists\nlike Missy Elliott and TLC, T&T have a good chance of getting some recognition and the material on this album certainly has potential to break into the\npublic limelight. If you're an r&b fan you\nshould definitely try and give this a listen;\nit will not disappoint. If you're an r&b virgin then this is a great album to indulge\nin. It displays everything that goes into\nmaking the sound that is r&b. There's fast\nand slow tracks, hard and soft beats,\nsharp and smooth vocals, and of course,\nno shortage of dirty talk. EJ\nAsad\nF or a band hailing from Alabama,\nwhere it's not unusual to be married to your horse and be having\nan affair with your sister at the same\ntime, Remy Zero sound remarkably\nBritish. I'm not bad-mouthing the\nStates but the current crop of talent is\nBritish and American artists are either\nwell established or nothing special.\nWhile Villa Elaine is an exception to that\nrule, it's still not incredibly different.\nEven though the emphasis is on\nover driven guitars and subtle effects\nsuch as fl angers, choruses and (my personal favourite) vibrato, Remy Zero\naren't afraid to show their softer side on\ntracks like Life In Rainwitb some delicate\nvocal harmonies. The lyrics and indeed\nthe vocals on Hollow ate reminiscent of\nthe late Shannon Hoon from Blind\nMelon, with hints of (gasp) Brian Molko,\nwhile the rest of the song has a huge\nfeel to it. The effects are taken into\nindustrial/ experimental territory by the\ninclusion on many tracks of what I can\nonly call noise. You know when someone holds a mic too close to an amp and\nyou get a banshee screech? Well, it's like\nthat, and there's just no need unless the\nsound of squealing brakes is on your\nagenda. The single Gramarye, however,\nis one of the top tracks on Villa Elaine.\nIt's intensely dark and pretty scary (or is\nthere just something wrong with me?)\nbut it has a slight 60s retro-ness to it, as\ndo all the tracks on the album. From the\nwhole feel of the album although not\ntypically American, it's not hard to hear\nthe influence of Adam Duritz of Counting Crows in those guitars and the some-times-wistful lyrics. But perhaps the most\nenjoyable track is the closing Goodbye\nSmall WorldThat smacks of an early tou\nReed and the Velvet Underground at\ntheir deceptively upbeat best.\nWith this album Remy Zero have\nmanaged to imitate a hell of a lot of\nmusicians, all the while keeping an identity of their own. And even if it's not terribly ground breaking, there's fun to be\nhad guessing who they'll sound like\nnext. El\nChristian\n\n"

Laura Barker, Imperial's AUT\nrepresentative, said she was \"very dis-appointed\" with the decision. David\nHellard thanked the AUT for trying to\ngive the money to students, describing It is \"a great sign... of their commitment to the students of the\ncollege\". Responding to College's decision to withhold the pay, Mr Hellard remarked \"it's a nice way to save\na bit of money\". He cynically continued \"having known IC for a year, I don't think they would ever pass a chance to make some money.\"\nMeanwhile further AUT action is\nexpected this month. According to a press release dated 31 May, AUT members will \"boycott a range of bureaucratic procedures in universities\",\nstarting on 1 June. The press release\npromised, however, that \"teaching\nand research will remain unhindered\".\nFurther action on exams, lasting up to\nfour days, is also threatened. Exactly\nwhat action will be taken at Imperial\nremains to be seen, and was subject\nto an AUT meeting last Thursday after\nFelix went to press.

    "content": "7 June 1999\nAlbums\nHOMEUFE\na**** Music 1\n1\nKHAN\n1-900-Get-Khan\nT his is the first release from\nHomelife, a collection of m usos from different backgrounds\nwho all decided to have a jam together\nand record the result. You would think\nthat this could make it unstructured and\ntedious, but the whole thing remains\nvery tight. The first thing you notice on\nlistening to the album is the astonishing array of instruments - everything\nfrom cello and violin to sty lo phone and\nsaw.\nThere are vocals, but these are kept\nSingles\nto a minimum, and the album is mainly\ninstrumental. A whole mix of styles live\nhappily together, with elements of jazz,\nlatin, funk and reggae. The overall theme\nis definitely chilled. Summer-time-ls-here again kind of tunes. Homelife has some\nabsolutely gorgeous melodies, that you\njust want to chew on and swallow In the\nhope that a part of that soul will be integrated into your own.\nI love the way they strip down a melody to its bare essentials and show\nit off to the world in all its naked beauty.\nThey then set it against a flowing background of upbeat rhythms and beautiful\nnoises that complement in a way rarely\nheard.\nThere's very little to complain about\nhere, but if I have one complaint, it's that\nit sometimes gets a bit surreal. Towards\nthe middle of the album, random\ninstruments pop up all over the place.\nCoupled with the occasional distorted,\ntrip py vocal, I did start to feel a bit dis-orientated. It's not long, however, before\nthey get back on track and it seems like\nthe whole thing actually does fit in, and\nit's just part of a bigger plan. There is definitely more concern with the feel of\nthe album as a whole, father than for\neach individual track.\nIn places, it sounds like some of the\ninstrumental tracks on Beastie Boys' /\n/\n/\nCommunication, especially Track 11 with\nits scratching. But my favourite track has\nto be Haddows Cizz, with its catchy guitar riff and shu f fly rhythm. This will make\na fine single one day.\nIf exam stress is getting to you, just\nput on this CD, lie back and let the\nmelodies flow around you. 1\n3\n1\nTom\nT he album cover has to be seen\nto be believed. Those of you\nchoosing to buy this album\nmust unfortunately suffer the indignity\nof doing so in public. It'll be one of\nthose moments when you think noone is around but as you pick it up,\nyou'll find a small crowd of people\nlooking at you as if you're some kind of\nsick weirdo. I thankfully procured the\nalbum in the confines of the Felix\nOffice (once I'd pulled it away from the\nsweaty palms of an aroused Joel).\nt900 Cet-Khan is a collection of\nminimalist-chilled-out beats and bleeps,\nperfectly suited to a Swedish-furniture emporium concourse or a nouvelle-cui-sine eatery. Precise, exact, anatomically\ncorrect and oh so lifeless and insubstantial. Palpable cleanliness, alabaster\nveneers, no grit, no grim, no soul.\nSounding like a poor-man's Lil Louis, it's the perfect music for doing something\nto when you're so involved in your task\nyou're oblivious to aural sensations. In\nfact, word has just reached me of Roche's intention to market the album\nas a replacement for Rohypnol. E3\nChris\nThe Frames - Pavement Tune\nTrack 1 is the trashy one, track 2 the medium-paced one\nand track 3 the slow burning acoustic number. Earnest,\nworkman-like rock. Dull, Insipid, hackneyed. Delete as\nappropriate.\nNo Doubt - New\nThe major players in the unforgettable ska-revival of\n1997 that lasted all of one weekend on MTV are back.\nThis time around the word is SKIFFLE! Yes, all herald the\ngreat skiffle renaissance! Only joking, or am I? Muse - Uno\nA voracious guitar and cymbals ago-go intro gives way\nto an aching vocal track with bouncy bass, tremulous\nguitar and shimmering drums. Very good indeed,\nshame about the B sides.\nCorduroy - Moshl Moshl\nPlinky, plo nky, all aboard the toy-town train. Enough\nsaid, really.\nCTD - Keep A Lid On Things\nWhispered baritone and falsetto vocals call and respond\nover smooth synthetic drums with a hint of tabla. I haven'ta clue what they're on about but it sure sounds\ngood.\nBarker - Fireside Conversation\nVocal, guitar, bass and drums. A tried and tested for-mula, yet still it astounds and often amazes. It also fails\nand bores, this being a case in point.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy, Hey Old\n'Hey boy! Hey girl! Superstar DJs! Here we go!' opines\nthe vox over a refrain not too dissimilar to a KLF tune.\nAnd the heaving masses of disco-dwellers from Clacton\nto Kavos shake their bits all summer long. A fine tune\nindeed.\nCooler - Disco Sucks\nFunky basslines, rhythmic beats and soulful keyboards\n- rather like a disco track. Oh it's a joke, right I see....\nBoom-Boom Manclnl - Super Model Human\nA very fine, infectious poppy number with a singer who\ndoesn't sound too dissimilar to the one out of Magoo\n(if that means anything to you).\nSimon Fisher Turner - Oh Venus\nThe bass reverberation of the first track resonates at a frequency similar to that of my ear drums. Hence the\nblood, hence the pain and hence my inability to hear\nthe remainder of the tracks. Which is a good thing if\nthe face of my cat is anything to go by.\nDark Star - About 3am Another great song from Dark Star whereby a tale of\ninconsequential existence is enveloped within guitars\nthat chime and also guitars that roar.\nFridge - EPH\nAt 8 tracks long this is hardly a single and a bit of a mixed\nbag, alternating between John Barry compositions for\nthe th it d millennium and discordant tosh that gets\nplayed at Plastic People every Saturday.\nThe Miracle Mile - Heroes and Misfits EP\nGod this is painful, will this stack of substandard CDs\never be exhausted? I feel like Sisyphus, will my task ever\nend or bring reward?\nWitness - Audition\nHey, what do you know, a decent song. Witness, may\nyou join the Gods on Olympus and leave these pitiful\nmortals in whose presence you are found. El\nChris\n\n"

The songs are\nalready market tested, the titles are\npre-sold and there's only one hitch: Their\nstories appeal mostly to adults, while\nmost feature-length cartoons are aimed\nat children. It need not be so. In Japan,\nadults buy more tickets to animation than\nchildren do - and as a result feature car-toons, with their glorious freedom over\nspace and logic, represent up to a fourth\nof ticket sales.\nBut here animation is mostly linked\nwith bold heroes, cute little animals and\ncolourful sidekicks. And one of the problems with The King and I, which has been\nanimated by Richard Rich for Warner Bros.,\nis that the story is not intrinsically interesting to kids. The Rodgers and Hammerstein classic is concerned with a romance\nbetween a British schoolteacher and the\nking of Siam; a parallel romance takes\nplace between the prince and a servant girl.\nBoth romances involve defiance of class\nand convention, and kids aren't much\ntuned into that.\nThis animated Ihe King and/does add\nYul Brlnner meets Jimmy Hill. Kinda.\nsome characters designed for children.\nThere's the roly-poly Master fit tle, assistant\nto the evil prime minister. He's flossing his\nteeth the first time we see him, and then\nit's a running gag that he keeps getting\nthem knocked out. Alas, he has so many\nteeth that the gag runs out before the\nteeth do. The movie also has a fire-breath-ing dragon, a hot-air balloon adventure,\nfireworks, a black panther and a lot of\nroyal children. But still it lacks energy, and\nthe story's barriers to romance aren't that\ninteresting to younger viewers.\nYet I applaud the experiment. The challenge is to make adaptations that are\nintended for adults, and then attract adults\nto the theatres. Go into any video store and\nyou will find long shelves of Japanese animation aimed at grownups. The tapes rent\nlike crazy. Now to find a way of porting that\naudience over to the movies. D Janine\nWin tickets to The Matrix with the\nKENSINGTON\nIf you ever read any of the leading\nfilm and reviews magazines then\nyou're certain to have noticed the massive buzz surrounding the impending\nrelease of The Matrix. It's an utterly\nastounding movie, re pleat with brilliant action sequences, fantastic effects\nand mind-warping plot - so see it any\nway you can. However, there's only\none way to win a free pair of tickets,\nand that's by answering the following\nquestion:\nWhat links The Matrix with\nSylvester Stallone?\nEmail your answer to fl lm. felix @lc.ac.uk\nbefore Wednesday evening. The first\nfive names out of the virtual hat will\nwin a pair of tickets.\nWell done as ever to all those people\nwho correctly identified the answer to\nlast week's competition. As you all spot-ted, Julia Roberts starred alongside Alan\nRickman in Michael Collins, whilst Hugh\nGrant shared billing with Mr Rickman\non both Sense & Sensibility and An\nAwfully Big Adventure. The first five\ncorrect entries to be drawn at random\nwere:\nHelmy Rahman\nEdward Bray\nTim Grant\nSyariza Kamsan\nDavid Morlarty\nThey each win a pair of tickets to see\nNotting Hill. Please drop into the Felix\noffice to collect your prize.\nPDATE\nDead Man's Curve\nOn recent evidence, when it comes to\nhamming it up, Mathew Llllard is clearly\nHollywood's over actor of choice. In She's Like That he steals every scene he\nappears in, thanks to comic timing,\nappa ling dancing and being thoroughly\nobnoxious; in Scream he hammed his\nway to the big time in prime psycho\nmode; and here, in Dan Rosen's low\nbudget thriller, he's finally offered full\nreign to throw his weight about in a movie entirely based around his ability\nto draw every last thread of emotion out\nof a scene. Sadly, It's let down by being\ntoo clever for it's own good, but its\nworth renting for the finale alone.\nThe Negotiator\nDespite being a perfectly adequate\nmovie, The Negotiator feels like a real\nlet-down simply because you're constantly calculating what it could have\nbeen. After all, the combination of Kevin\nSpacey and Samuel L Jackson should be\nan award winning one particularly\nwhen combined with some taut direction in the shape of F Gary Grey, foo ke d at from the opposite point of view, how-ever, it's lifted from utter mediocrity by\ntwo of Hollywood's finest throwing lines\nat each other with an incredibly intense\nfury. So, what are you left with? Two\ndamn fine performances and a fairly\nsilly plot, that's what.\nSaving Private\nRyan\nThe Spielberg-ster's back, and he's trying\nharder than ever to make everyone love\nhim, mixing Schindler's List depth and\nattention to detail with Jaws set-pieces\nand Jurassic Park effects. He even throws\nIn a few hundred buckets of blood for\ngood measure. Yet whilst what remains\nis undoubtedly a quality piece of celluloid - the first twenty minutes are the\nwork of a master film-maker - you never\nconnect with the characters, and thus\nnever really care what happens to them.\nIn a way that's Spielberg's aim (soldiers\nare just a bunch of ordinary guys etc\netc), yet it defeats the point of his movie.\nWhich is a shame.\nDave\n\n"

    "content": "7 June 1999 Arts 9\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION CHOIR CONCERT\nHoly Trinity Church\nBouquets and bubbly - Soloist Miranda Keys, organist Andrew Earls and choir performers Alex Cope, Stuart McDermott\nand Philip Angell graciously receive the accolades of success and appreciation\nT he venue for the choir's performance on Friday 28 May was the\nHoly Trinity Church on Prince Consort Road - a contrast to The Great\nHall in the Sherfield building, where last\nterm's Verdi Requiem was so vigorously performed. The small church was\nvery quickly filled with friends and family of choir members and once the\nbenches had been shuffled about to\ncreate the required legroom, everyone\nsettled back to enjoy the concert.\nThe performance began with Benjamin Britten's Te Deum in C immediately the church filled with the sound\nof the organ and with the breathtaking\nharmony of the well-balanced four-part\nchoir. The acoustics inside the church\nensured that the listener was at once\nsurrounded by music. Soloist Miranda\nKeys required little effort in order to lift\nher voice above the organ and choir.\nThere were captivating solo performances from members of the choir\nduring Britten's Rejoice in the Lamb.\nThe words to this piece are based on extracts from an eighteenth century\npoem by Christopher Smart about a pets on subject to bizarre visions. We\nwere assured twice that \"the Mouse is\na creature of great personal valour\".\nAnd this particularly feisty animal obviously was, as it was pte pared to\nengage a cat (no doubt in order to\nteach it a lesson) which had just\nattacked its miss us! The conflict was\ngiven added flair by the organist,\nAndrew Earis, who characterised the cat\nand mouse in his playing.\nNext the Chamber Choir performed Agnus Dei by Barber. This is the\nchoral arrangement of Adagio for\nStrings. Here the sopranos managed\nsuperbly and the church filled with a continuous flow of notes that touched\neven the deepest of emotions (and\nperiodically put the stained glass in\nserious danger).\nAn assortment of strings joined the\nchoir for Monteverdi's Beatus Vir, which\nadded warmth and depth to the performance and formed a bass continuo\nessential to the music, which varied from\nsolo phrases to those for the whole\nensemble.\nImmediately after the interval, it was\napparent that the choir had become\nsomewhat depleted and fearful of the\naudience as they were huddled together\nat the back of the choir stand. Once the\npiece A Hymn to the Mother of God by\nTavener began, we realised that the rest\nof the choir was located at the back of\nthe church with the audience sitting in-between. As you may imagine, this\nposed a bit of a problem for conductor\nThereesTkach Hibbard who turned sideways to face the west wall. This enabled\nher to direct the group at the front with\nher right hand and the group at the\nback with her left hand. Many in the\naudience followed her example, swivelling in their seats for the best position to\nlisten. But this hardly mattered as the\nchords rolled over the walls and across\nthe high ceiling to produce a wonderful\n'surround sound' effect - a characteristic of the whole evening.\nThe concert ended with Mozart's Vespers, composed in 1780 before he\nmoved to Vienna. The choir sang the\nPsalms beautifully (with characteristic\ndiminishing seventh in Laudate pueri\nthat I had been instructed to look out\nfor). There were notable performances\nfrom the ICUC soloists who deservedly\nreceived gifts and great applause from\nthe audience at the end. It was obvious\nto all present that the choir had relished\nperforming these pieces and the\nevening was a great success. Thank you\nto all involved.\nRachel\nConductor Therees Tkach Hibbard, with musicians and choristers accepting the audience's applause\n\n"

Of course, finding\na cinema cool enough to let you\nindulge In this classic may prove difficult at first, but as you will soon dis-cover, the reward is worth the search.\nThis is a film best seen on the big\nscreen if you wish to discover why it\nhas so often been credited with the\ntitle of 'best movie ever made'. As far\nas Hollywood is concerned. Citizen\nKane epi to mises all that a great film\nshould be.

I wish I was taking the stats\nexam that he described. It's reassuring to\nknow that there is a help system available\nin the exam, but I assure our dear Kev\nthat if he only had half an hour to complete the four stats tests required, he might feel just a little bit pressed for time. Perhaps the reason 'so many wannabe doctors failed' Is the fact that\nthey are selected to deal with people, rather than with machines like the majority of IC.\nMost of the first year medics I know harbour no ill thoughts or prejudices\ntowards other IC students. I find Kevin's column deeply upsetting and very negative. We( as first years) find ourselves in\na very awkward position. On the one hand we have older medics telling us to\nstick to medic tradition, and on the other\nwhen we try to integrate with IC we are\naccused of being \"arrogant\" by snide dick heads such as our friend Kevin. If ICU\nwant medics to be fully integrated into\ntheir union( less \"independent\"), then I suggest that this outdated attitude is rel-e gated to the scrap heap where it\nbelongs in time for next years fresher s! A First Year Medic Mr Dear Furry Friend,\nWhy did you devote half a page in the last Issue to someone who by his own admission, knows nothing about no th ing? I'm not taking issue with his views\nabout the academic ability required to\npass the first year medical statistics exam;\nI too, consider It somewhat farcical. He might have looked for a more original\nperspective on it though, don't you think,\nrather than implicit y putting the whole thing down to some sort of iniquitous\ntreatment for those of us in the BMS. Not\ntotally unrelated is the slight in the same article on the medical lecturer who was broadcast to the biologists in the neighbouring lecture theatre. Hardly his fault,\nbut of course, he was a doctor and so fair\ngame... or was he? Well, never mind, that's just factual accuracy and NOBODY cares about that...\nYours,\nIdris Harding Fair comment, but Kevin's cynicism Is\nnot solely directed at medics - ICU and\nCollege have both come under criticism.\nAs for the last point, I think It was his\ncontinuation of the lecture, rather than\nthe technical problems themselves,\nwhich was the object of Kevin's slight dig. -Ed\nFair Pay and Fair Grants\nDear Felix,\nI wonder whether\"2 nd yr bio under-grad\" (Felix 1147) has taken part in any activity to defend the student grant and oppose the introduction of fees. If s/ he\nhad, they would surely know that lecturers have shown great interest in the funding debate and have indeed\" showed solidarity to students over the tuition fees issue.\"\nWhen tuition fees were first floated\nas a possibility by LSE, IC AUT sent a letter of support to a student conference held to oppose their introduction. Nationally, AUT submitted a well thought out\nalternative to the current funding syst em which can be read on-line at\nhttp://www.aut.org.uk. I have been on every national student demonstration since 1993 and there are always local AUT and NATFHE banners flying. When iCU\nLabour Club organised a debate on tuition fees last year, IC AUT members attended and voiced their opposition to fees, reminding us that AUT has lobbied parliament against them. Please, please, stop trying to turn\nthe issue into 'Lecturers v Students' and let's stand together: Fair Pay for Staff, Fair\nGrants for Students, as the placard displayed on the front page of last week's felix stated clearly.\nGeorge Constantinides\nPG Student and IC AUT member Rythmes all Wrong\nHello,\nSorry to be sad and pedantic (typical IC\npost grad then ;-)), but I couldn't help\nnoticing the minor c langer your music\nreviewer dropped in issue 1147.

Both David Hellard\nand Nick Griffith urged these students\nto go along to the Union Office and\nbuy a ticket as soon as possible, rather\nthan waiting until the last minute next\nweek.

Large\ngroups, however, should purchase\ntheir tickets as soon as possible as\nbig bookings may be refused as the\nfinal deadline draws near. The deadline has been postponed in an\nattempt to generate more ticket sales,\nprompting rumours of a slow pick up\nin sales as exams draw to a close.\nAccording to Union sources\naround six hundred tickets had been\nsold by last Wednesday, significantly\nlower than the two thousand needed in order for the event to break even.\nAccording to Nick Griffith, Chair of the\nSummer Ball committee, a further\nthree hundred tickets have been\nreserved; \"lots of people booked who\nhaven't paid\" he explained.

The Radio edit and the Original Mix both play around effectively with\na great little piano score, and some cheesy, but not too grating, vocals. These\nare the mixes that will deservedly propel this happy hark back to '95/96\nstraight into the charts and the minds of c lubbers all summer.\nBut beware of the Mirrorball Vocal 12\" Mix. This slightly more underground\nversion is disturbingly easy to listen to, despite its main pieces sounding\nlike a retake of some horrible '80s Depeche Mode-style effort. Very worry-ing. The adoption of '80s musical influence by the dance community\nwould be a very bad thing. Please don't let it happen.\nOut 21 st June\nNab Twins Nab Twins\nThe March (Nab Twins Remix)' 0\nNab Twin 1: \"Hey, Nab, I 've got a great idea for a wicked tune!\"\nNab Twin 2: \"Yeah, what's that bro?\"\nNab Twin 1: \"Well, y 'see, what you do is you get a really annoying bass drum.\nYou know, one of those really harsh ones that penetrates your skull and\ngives you the biggest migraine you've ever had.

Out 14th June.\nMoogwal\n'Night Out'\n(Platlpus)\nExcellent epic tune - with its deep, dark melody and filtered, rich beats this makes\nfor a great track in the mould of 'Northern Exposure'. Already being hammered\nby Sasha and Digweed, 'Night Out' is everything you could wish for in an epic\nhouse tune. The flip side is a completely different track, 'Moogwai' but isn't as good as 'Night Out'. Out at the end of July.\n\n"

    "content": "16 Sport & Crossword 7 June 1999\nPredictions count for nothing\nHmmm. Last time I make predictions.\nSome of you may remember that earlier\nthis term I predicted that Manchester\nUnited would fail to win the treble.\nAhem. I also predicted that Zimbabwe\nhad absolutely no chance of getting out\nof the group stages of the Cricket World\nCup. Oh dear.\nFirst off, many congratulations to\nManchester United on a tremendous\nseason that will hopefully put English\nfootball firmly back on the map, and\ngive the national team the impetus it\nneeds to qualify for the European Championship finals. Watch out for Tottenham\nnext season as they emulate Man U's achievements (Well I can hope can'tI?). The second prediction that I made also\nfailed miserably. Unfortunately it had far\nworse consequences for English cricket.\nBy beating South Africa, Zimbabwe not\nonly qualified for the second round with\na maximum 4 points, and a good chance\nof making it to the semi-finals, but they\nalso eliminated an England team who\ncould not beat India at Edgbaston. What\nmakes the whole thing much sadder\nwas that this was the perfect chance for\nEngland, at home, to put English cricket\nback on the map. But they failed, and I am afraid the blame can only be attributed to the fact that England does not\nproduce cricketers of a high enough\nstandard, somewhat perversely because\nthey play too much cricket. English\ncricket must now look for new, stronger,\nclassier players if they hope to try again\nin South Africa in 4 years.\nThe other sides in the world cup still\ngive the tournament an exciting look,\nand now no team has an unbeaten\nrecord. India have the best batsmen in\nthe tournament, South Africa the best\nbowlers and Pakistan the best all round\nteam, plus the comedy that is Inzamamul-Haq's running between the wickets. I will push the boat out and say the semifinalists will be Pakistan, Zimbabwe,\nSouth Africa and Australia, and Pakistan\nwill win the cup.\nCloser to home, Imperial's1st XI\nULU cup semi final was postponed last\nWednesday and rescheduled for y ester day. The result was unknown as Felix\nwent to press.lf IC won, then the final will\nbe on Wednesday.Full reports next week.\nClayponds give Brabazon a beating\n23 May saw Clayponds prepared to take\non the might of Brabazon house in what\npromised to be a meeting of epic pro-portions. The advantage however was\nslightly with Clayponds since they were\nplaying on home soil and had a squad\nof Manchester United proportions without any less skill (I sense bias here)\nThe game started briskly with Clayponds seeking to make their home\nadvantage tell. This proved to be difficult against a solid Brabazon defence\nwho held out fot some time. Then the\nincessant attacking paid dividends as\nthe defence paused momentarily and\nthe ball was slipped to Kilroy who hammered it past the helpless keeper. Ten\nminutes passed and a beautiful ball\nfound Brabazon's star striker Parag who\nfired a shot which would have screamed\ninto the top corner had it been a proper\nset of goalposts and not just MOT cones,\nexpertly \"borrowed\" by Wilma. Fuzzy\nwas then presented with a golden opportunity in front of goal but managed to\nslot It neatly passed the keeper. A further goal for Clayponds from Kilroy made\nit 2-2. With a minute of the half to go,\nthe ball got fed through as Kurt and\nBenny managed to tackle each other\nrather than Chris who was left to blast a shot past the keeper into the top corner\nof the goal; 3-2 at half time.\nBrabazon showed their true colours\nin the second half. When they won a free kick on the edge of the area it was\ndown to the midfield maestro Fuzzy to\nshow what he could do. A solid defensive wall was in front of him, but with this\nman it didn't matter as with David Beckham-ll ke precision, he drifted the ball\nover the wall past the keeper. However, Clayponds then began to show\ntheir dominance, scoring 3 more goals\nto make it 6-3 to Clayponds. Tony \"I think\nI'm Pavarotti\" scored the day's final goal.\nFinal score 7-3.\nThe game was played in fantastic\nspirit in front of a capacity crowd (well\nalmost). Despite the result the game was\nfairly close for most of the match and\nonly Brabazon's lack of fit blok es let\nthem down at the end. Afterwards\nBrabazon were treated to cheers and\nbooze in Clayponds' communal garage\n- any chance of getting a village hall?\nLast week's crossword was won by Robert Chatley.

    "content": "8 Feature 7 June 1999\nFly American!\nNeil Mothew describes the start of his trip across America at the controls of a light aircraft\nCar rental companies don't like under-25\nyear olds. Many won't even serve them.\nIf they do, they charge ridiculous\namounts for insurance. They just don't trust us. So, what does a21 year-old with\na passion for travelling do to get around\nthe US?\nHitchhiking? That's dangerous. Greyhound buses? They're slow and uncomfortable. Trains? They're infrequent and\nexpensive. Solution: rent a plane. There\nis no such age discrimination with light\naircraft rental. All you need is a pilot's licence and about four weeks of holiday\njob wages to pay for it. No check-in\nmeans you can wake up when you like\nand go when and wherever you want.\nYou get a great view of the country when\ncruising below 10,000 feet, and it's quite\nquick as well.\nWe hired a Cessna 182 from\nMeacham Field, an airport just West of\nFort Worth. This is a single engine, four\nseater aircraft which cruises at around\n155 mph. I shared the flying with Russ,\na pilot I met at flying school. This meant\nwe could split the costs, making the trip\nslightly more affordable. Plus, being\nAmerican, he had lots of family and\nfriends who we visited along the way,\nthereby avoiding the cost of hotels as\nmuch as possible. We were on a tight\nbudget after all.\nDallas - Fort Worth\nDallas has two claims to fame - one\nbeing JR Ewing and the other the JFK\nassassination. It was also to be the place\nwe would start our journey.\nThe schoolbook repository - the\nfamous building from where Lee Harvey\nOswald supposedly assassinated JFK in\n1963 has been preserved as a museum.\nThe book storage books are stacked as\nthey were on the day. The window is\nopen and Lee Harvey Oswald isn't there.\nYou can't go near the window - it is\nglassed off. If you could, then you would\nwonder how on earth L. H.O. fired that\nshot with such accuracy. He must have\nbeen quite a gifted contortionist.\nOther places of interest include the\nFort Worth Stockyards. This used to be the\ncentre of trade for cattle, but now is\nmore a hangout for wanna-be cowboys\n(and girls) and country music lovers. It is\nalso where Walker Texas Ranger is filmed.\nI was lucky enough to catch Tanya Tucker\nperforming at Billy Bob's Honky Tonk;\nfamed as being the World's largest\n'Honky Tonk' (whatever that is!)\nIn the summer, the average temperature\nis around 10OF(37 C) which may be a bit\nof a shock to the system. Everything is\nvery spaced out and public transport is virtually non-existent, so a car with air conditioning is an absolute necessity. Whilst\nthere, I asked what it took to get a Texas\ndrivers' license... the response was that\nyou had to \"be a good shot and a bad dr i ver\". Watch out for the pick-up trucks\nwith shot-gun racks in the back window!\nRefuelling Stop - Tyler, Texas\nNormally I wouldn't mention a routine\nstop to fill up with fuel, but this one\nsticks in my memory. On landing we\nwere intercepted by not one, but two\ngolf carts from different companies with\n'FOLLOW ME' signs on the back. Each cart\nwas driven by a beautiful girl in a cheerleader outfit - one wearing Texaco\ncolours and the other Exxon colours. So,\non choosing Ms Exxon, we followed and\nparked. She rolled a red carpet up to the\nplane and asked us how many gallons\nwe wanted. With the fuel tanks in the\nwings, I'm glad we had a high-wing air-plane! That's what I call service.\nNew Orleans, Louisiana\nArriving at night, I can't say I saw much\nof New Orleans from the alt. We flew\ninto Lakefront airport - a mere three\nmiles from the centre of town. Our hippie taxi driver (he had just left a com-m une) took us to the Longpre\nguesthouse. Planted firmly in the lovely\nGarden District, this hostel'is within easy\ntravelling distance of the French Quarter\nvia the streetcar.\nWith an average of four murders a day, New Orleans is one of the most dangerous US cities. Unless you have a death\nwish, the area to walk around is the\nFrench Quarter. Certain areas of the city\nare particularly dangerous and it is\nextremely easy to wander from the seemingly safe tourist areas into dod gy areas.\nAs we discovered, many street people\nmake a good living preying on tourists\nwho might stray. One of these people\napproached us rather forcefully, demanding a dollar to let us live. I only had 75c in my pocket, so I negotiated and\nseemed to avoid any trouble. Even the\nmuggers are cheap in New Orleans.\nNew Orleans is an amazing, un sleep ing party town. Numerous bars, Jazz\nclubs, oyster restaurants, strip joints and\nthe occasional voodoo shop make for\nlively trade on Canal Street. Vendors dispense lethal cocktails, going by the name\nof \"The Hurricane\", in pint cups. After\nimbibing two of these \"extra loaded\"\nbeverages, I discovered where this drink\ngot its name from - it wipes you out like\na hurricane! Yes, this was the first (and\nhopefully last) place I had a blackout. I don't know which higher power guided\nme back to the hostel, but I couldn't eat\nfor three days.\nLacking a sense of smell whilst walking along Canal Street is a definite advantage - it is quite nauseating unless you\nenjoy an aroma of fresh vomit. Roaming\namong drunk tourists and students, you\nwill soon relinquish control of your legs\nand let the flow of pedestrian traffic take\nyou to the next worthy establishment.\nMoonlighting cops serve at bars, so as\nlong as you don't stray from the crowds,\nthings are reasonably safe; you are\nunlikely to come to much bodily harm.\nAfter a thorough recovery from alcohol\npoisoning, it was time to file the flight\nplan and move on.\nEl Paso, Texas\nI was immediately struck by the urban\ndesolation of El Paso - and that was in the\ncity's downtown business district. Many\npeople opt to run for the bot der in search\nof action, as the schmaltzy Mexican town\nof Juarez is only a mile away. We spent\na night there eating Tacos and then flew\nnorth to Albuquerque.\nThis part of the desert requires very\ncareful navigation. Restricted and military\noperation areas are no-fly zones and aircraft are restricted to flying in designated\nnarrow corridors. This is the place where\nthe supposedly top-secret Lockheed\nSkunkworks and Area 47 are located.\nStray and you might be intercepted and\nescorted out by military jet. If you don't get shot down, you will certainly get a stiff talking to once on terra firma if you\nget the map reading wrong.\nAlbuquerque, New Mexico\nThe staff at Albuquerque airport were\nextremely helpful and friendly. Before\nwe even asked, they told us where to\nstay, where the happening nightlife was\n(there wasn't) and even where the $5\nhookers worked.\nThere is plenty to do downtown and\non trendy Nob Hill nearby. We were told\nthe historic old town was also worth a visit, but we didn't make it there.\nWe got our kicks on Route 66. The\nfamous highway passes through Albuquerque. Here, you can spend an\nevening just watching boy racers in their\nturbocharged drag cars cruising Main\nStreet and revving their engines in the\nhope of instigating a race. Occasionally,\nwhen they met similarly-minded individuals, they get their way.\nWe woke up the next morning at\n6am to beat the desert heat and thermal\nwaves, which give unbearable turbulence in the afternoon. One plane check,\none flight plan, and one weather report\nlater, we were airborne and on our way\nto cross the barren desert.\nTruth or Consequences, New Mexico\nOne town we noticed en route was\ncalled 'Truth or Consequences'. The\nname was so interesting that we decided\nto take a refuelling stop, and investigate\nwhy on earth it was called that. The town,\nformerly named Hot Springs, changed its\nname in 1950 to that of a popular radio\nshow. The deal was that the radio show\nwould broadcast to its thousands of listeners from the town, thus attracting the\nattention of an unlimited tourist base. Just\nremember this was in an era before selling out was considered unfashionable. T or C also has some interesting ghost\ntowns, cliff dwellings and mountain outposts surrounding it, which ate well\nworth exploration.\nAnd so, we fired up the six cylinders\nand took off for the West Coast to San\nDiego...\n\n"

Served with a little salad\nthe whole thing looks stunning, and tastes pretty good too.\nIf you're careful In choosing the cheese, it should satisfy\neven the most particular vegetarian.\nRoast new potatoes are unusual, but fast becoming\na firm favourite of mine. In traditional cooking, onion and\nthyme make a great gray/. The combination complements roast potato surprisingly well.\nThe choice of Dolcelatte on the peppers is important.\nIts creaminess complements mushrooms perfectly. A non-creamy blue cheese would destroy the effect.\nPeppers Stuffed with Mushroom and Dolcelatte\nServes 4\n4 red peppers\n12 medium sized mushrooms\n200g dolce latte butter\ndouble cream\nblack pepper\nHeat the oven to to 200 degrees/gas mark 6. Divide the\nmushrooms into segments of about a centimetre. Melt\nenough butter in a fairly small pan to coat the mushrooms.\nLeave the mushrooms to sweat over a gentle heat for a couple of minutes, until the butter has soaked through,\nand a juice starts to accumulate in the bottom of the pan.\nAdd a tablespoon of double cream, and loads of ground\nblack pepper.\nUse a large sharp knife to slice the peppers in half. I like to cut right through the stalk, leaving half on each shell.\nCooks\nCorner\nRemove only the bulk of the core, by making a single cut\nunder the stalk then pulling gently.\nSpoon the mushroom mixture into the peppers, then\nplace on a greased baking sheet. Slice the dolce latte thinly\nthen lay on top. Cook the peppers for 20 minutes, until\nthe skin starts to turn black.\nRoast New Potatoes with Onion and Thyme\nServes 4\n750g waxy potatoes (such as Jersey Royals or Charlotte)\n3 medium onions\nthyme (a handful of fresh leaves, or 1 tbs p dried)\nbutter & olive oil\nPreheat the oven to 230 degrees/gas mark 8. Place a high\nsided, thick based baking tin over a medium heat, and melt\na generous knob of butter (40g ish) with a tablespoon of\nolive oil. Skin, then half the onions between the ends. Cut\neach half into eight, leaving small segments. Add the onion\nand thyme to the pan then cook (stirring regularly) until\nthe onion starts to brown. Transfer the pan to the oven,\nand cook for another 20 minutes. After this time, they be\ncara mali sed and wonderfully sticky.\nCut the potatoes so that all the pieces are bite-sized,\nthen add to a pan of boiling, salted water. Bring the water\nback to the boil and simmer for five minutes.\nWhen the onion is ready, add the potato to the baking tray and stir. Lower the heat to 200 degrees/gas mark\n6. Cook (stirring every 10 minutes) until the potato skins\nare brown and shrivelled. This will take about half an hour.\nSimmer for an hour, then season and serve with rice\nor a baked potato.\nNext week: Death to diets, and perfect mushrooms.\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nICU Annual General Meeting\nKevin attended the recent ICU Annual\nGeneral Meeting where predictably,\nthere was a good showing of medics. It\nis at this meeting that some of next\nyear's Union Officers are elected. One\nhighlight was the wannabe doctor who\nstood for Equal Opportunities Officer,\nwith the aim of eliminating discrimination\nbetween students because they are from\ndifferent Constituent Colleges. In other\nwords non-medics should be welcome at\nmedic events and vice-versa. Unfortunately, the other medics in the room\nwere not too happy with this proposal\nand he was not elected. Kevin hopes he\nwill not have been put off by his defeat.\nThe Union needs people like him, to\nensure that they are providing a service\nfor, and representing all members of\nour university, and not just the fraction\nof students based in South Ken. Another\ninteresting event was the election of\nnext year's Haldane Music Buyer, who\npromised to purchase all albums that\nwere requested by Union members.\nObviously with this reckless attitude\nthe budget will not last for long, so Kevin\nsuggests getting your requests in early to\npresident@ic.ac.uk\nWebsite Superiority\nImperial college has to have the coolest\nphonetically pronounceable web / e mail\naddress of any university. Perhaps it\nshould be used in the prospectus: \"come\nto IC and become <your name> at ick a ck uck.\" I'm sure everyone reading this\nwould agree that it sounds much better\nthan mit.edu or ox.ac.uk however you\nsay it. Kevin also noticed that\nhttp://www.mit.edu gets you to MIT's students website and the non-intuitive\nhttp://www.web.mit.edu is the location\nof the official website. Perhaps IC students should lobby for:\nhttp://www.ic.ac.uk to be handed to the\nstudents.\nSend ideas and contributions to\nkevin_ mishmash@ hotmail.com\nWhy Wye?\nAt the Chelsea flower show, there was a stand from Wye College. A prominent\nsign on the stand advertised the prospective 'merger' with Imperial College.
