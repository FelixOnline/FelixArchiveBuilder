    "content": "Dear FELIX\nLately I have been very concerned about your letter diet. In\nfact I think that you, dear pussycat must be pretty sick of eating\nthe same old thing all the time. You had enough of it last year\nand so far this term it seems to have become your staple diet.\nBut of course, you can only eat what is given you, so let me\ndirect my nutritional complaint to your feeders: For God's sake,\nwill you stop imposing your own views on abortion on other\npeople by giving poor old kitty-cat FELIX here a massive excess\nof abortion letters. I'm sure that on a subject as sensitive as this\none people can make up their own minds and don't have to be\ntold what sort of feeling the should have about abortion.\nSo all you potential abortion letter writers out there, please,\nplease, no more food for FELIX that comes in a big slop. Let's have something firm and meaty because I'm sure that eight out\nof ten IC students prefer it.\nFrom a bored cat,\nOliver Kleyn\nChem Eng 3\nOur story begins back on Sunday 9 May 1976. Jezebel, after taking\npart in the FELIX Treasure Hunt, set off with her crew down the Kings\nRoad to view a1912 Dennis Fire Engine. While gently de celle rating, a bang and clatter is heard from under the bonnet. On lifting the cover, the\nworst is found. A con-rod is broken and the crankcase is cracked.\nThe Royal College of Science Union Motor Club are grateful to: Mr\nJon Dennis of Dennis Motors, Guildford for a new, unused con-rod and\ncopies of their surviving general engine drawings: David Evans Ltd\n(Barimar) for trying to weld up the crankcase and sump (even though\nthey made a mess of it); Sir Hugh Ford, then Head of the Mechanical\nEngineering Department (now Pro-Rector), and the Rector (now) Lord\nFlowers for agreeing that the machining could be carried out in the\nMechanical Engineering Department's workshop; the Metallurgy and\nMaterials Science Department for determining, as found, that the\naluminium alloy of the crankcase and sump were un weld able. The pattern makers, WH Sheppard and Co., who are based just a few hundred yards from the site of the demise of the engine; Mr Terry\nSheppard of Met and Mat Sci Dept for putting us in touch with Alcan\nLaboratories, Banbury, who agreed to cast the new crankcase and\nsump; Mr Brian Gillett and Mr Keith Latimer of Alcan Laboratories for\nproducing excellent one-off castings of the complicated crankcase and\nsump; the Mech Eng Dept; Sir Hugh Ford; Mr Peter Moore; Dr Hill; the\npresent Head of Dept, Prof SAV Swanson; the Mech Eng Main\nWorkshop for coordinating the machining of the castings (even though\nthey didn't know quite what to expect); Thompson Engineering for re-metal ling the main bearings and checking the crankshaft.\nParticular thanks must go to Ken Barham in the workshop for carrying\nout the demanding task of preparing drawings and dimensions from the\nold damaged components and producing new parts to fit the existing\nundamaged parts of the engine. The expertise of his workmanship is\ndemonstrated by the running of the complete unit.\nDuring the three and a half years spent moving the parts of the engine\nfrom one expert to the next and a move from one garage (demolished\njust after moving out) to a new one six months later; the pump has been\nconnected up, and, with the engine running, is found to work. Thanks\nto: the Merseyside Metropolitan Fire Brigade for the pump; Mr John\nDennis for spares for the pump; CW Vass, Ampthill for pump\nequipment and Mr Lashbrook, Paxman Diesels apprentices for bearings\nfor the transmission.\nThanks also to all those who offered helpful suggestions and other\nwork towards getting J ez running.\nAnd finally, thanks to the Royal College of Science Union, Imperial\nCollege Union, the Royal College of Science Departments for financial\nassistance.\nRCSU Motor Club\nDear Colin\nTo change the subject, I'd now\nlike to mention the Rag Mag. In\naddition to IC Rag Mag, I 've also\nhad the pleasure of reading mags\nfrom Oxford and Surrey. The comparison was very striking in\nthree ways;\n1. Joke content\n2. Paper quality\n3. Advertising\nThe first point has been fairly\namply discussed. The second\npoint has been mentioned in\ndefence of our mag, but I can't see\nwhy we should be glad that our\nmag has wasted more trees than\nmags of other universities.\nThe third point has, I believe not\nbeen mentioned. If my memory is\ncorrect, then the main defence for\ncontinued sales of the mag was\nthat it would make money for the\nRag Appeal, which is obviously\ndesirable. So we wish the mag to\nraise as much money as possible\nfor chair ty, but this makes my observations appear a trifle\nstrange.\nRAG MAG NUMBER OF SIDES\nIC 42\nOxford 34\nSurrey \u2022 50\nFrom this comparison, one may\nsee that purchasers of the IC Rag\nMag are getting good value for\nmoney, but not IC Rag.\nWhy is there so little advertising\nin IC Rag Mag? Is it because of\nlack of effort on behalf of the Rag\nCommittee, is it that people who\nmight advertise are put off by the\nsupposed bad name of IC Rag\nMag or is it just not possible to get\nadvertising in London?\nIf the problem is the first then\nthe solution is simple, if it is the\nsecond then the solution is more\ntricky. It brings us right back to\nthe old argument about the\nquality of the jokes, but lends\nconsiderably more weight to the\nclean-up-the-mag campaigners,\nafter all it would be indefensible to\nreduce the amount of money\nraised by the mag, just to satisfy a desire for distasteful jokes.\nI'm not preaching conformity\nnor morals, I'm just interested in\nthe Rag Mag raising the maximum\namount of money for Rag.\nYours sincerely\nHodgson\nNUMBER OF SIDES OF ADVERTS\n2\n18\n27\n\n"

    "content": "REVIEWS w mmm MADNESS AFFECTS STUDENT\nThe new album by Madness, that is.\nTitled ONE STEP BEYOND it is their\ndebut album. Of the three groups\ncurrently enjoying success by reviving\nska, whatever that is, Madness are\narguably the best, certainly at writing\ngood tunes. The Specials' first single\nwas excellent.but they have since failed\nto follow it, and the Selector are really\nnon-starters.\nSTIFF\nMadness have now changed labels to\nStiff Records from the original ska\nrevival company, 2-tone. Stiff were\nnever slow to capital is e on any new\ntrend, and they have got themselves a band here who will soon be a very\npowerful force in the world of pop. They\nare to reggae what the Bootown Rats\nwere to punk when they started so long\nago, when Peter Powell was an\nun dreamed nightmare and the Sex\nPistols were still the greatest rock'n 'roll\nband in the world.\nNME\nOK so you've read about them in the\nmusic press, you know all about them\nalready and you have heard the rumours\nthat some of their fans are NF\nsupporters, but last week the NME\nfeatured an interview with the band in\nwhich they all renounced the Front, and\none claimed to have some black friends\nin the Front as well because they\ndisliked Greeks and Italians. Surely this\nshows the ignorance on which the Front\nis based, and bands like this do not\ndeserve bad publicity because some of\ntheir fans are stupid.\nMUSIC\nIn case you forgot, this is a record review\nso I'd better mention the music now.\nThere are fourteen tracks on this album\nand to go through each one in detail, as\nall deserve, would only be a bore and\nyou'd probably stop reading, which you\nare not to do OK?I must therefore\nattempt to single out a few tracks which I shall arbitrarily claim are the best.\nSINGLE\nSide one begins with the title track One\nStep Beyond currently a single and\nzooming up the charts. It is typical ofthe\nMadness style, heavy on the sax with a PROF BREMSSTRAHLUNG\nHey Prof' Are\nyou in there?\nreggae beat, inject some rocking guitar\nand a loony pianist and the whole thing\nvibrates with life.\nThe next track is a sort of ballad called\nMy Girl it begins with the line \"My girl's mad at me....\" and a heart string twangs\nin every male who ever had a girlfriend\nwho got mad at him. A gentler approach\nthis.\nNight Boat to Cairo bounces magically\naround a middle eastern sound, which\nI 'll mention again later. The Prince was\ntheir first single and this version is still\nvery catchy. As we romp on to the end of\nside one and we come to....\nNUTS\nTarzan's Nuts. If you remember Ron Ely\nas Tarzan in that wonderful TV series\nyou will be zonked by this reggae/ska\nversion of the theme tune. Side two is\nslightly less memorable, but has its\nmoments. In The Middle Of The Night is\nabout a nice old newsagent who\nunbeknown to his customers nips out\nunder the cover of darkness to nick their\nunderwear off the line. (Perhaps a relative of Arnold Layne?)\nSEX\nHave you ever wondered what would\nhappen to Swan Lake if it was given a reggae beat? Well, you can find out on\nthis album. It comes out like Egyptian\nReggae; maybe Johnathan Richman\nwas really ahead of his time. Rocking In\nA Flat is the next track and is, as the title\nsuggests, more tra dt ional rock'n 'roll.\nThe piano goes fast and furious down\nbelow and the guitar ing could be Nick\nLowe in places.\nVIOLENCE\nClosing the second side is a song called\nChipmunks Are Go, well less of a song,\nmore of a sort of US Navy chant. It is\ngreat fun to sing the responses when\nunder the influence: \"Sound p ff Chipmunks, Sound off Chipmunks,\n1234 1234\" and so it goes. The words are easy and don'te mba f as s anyone, so you\ncould have a go.\nVIRGIN\nThe record can be had for under three\nquid at Virgin Records, whom I hate for\nchopping a further 70p off the price\nsince I bought it. Go on, get into the\nnuttiest sound around.\nLeigh Foster\nT ALBUM REVIEW\nSurvival - Bob Marley and the\nWaiters (Tuff Gong/Island ILPS\n9542)\nThis is the first album from Bob Marley and\nthe Wailers, since Marley's pilgrimage to\nEthiopia (and the rest of Africa) and\nconsequently the album's main focus is upon\nAfrica. The cover has the flags of all the\nAfrican nations (as well as the Zap u and Zan u flags) as well as the storage plan of a slave\nship upon it.\nAnd so to the music. The overall sound is\nvery polished and is not 'hard' as some of the\nsounds currently emanating from J A. However, the lyrics and music are some of the\nmost powerful that Marley has written,\nespecially, 'Zimbabwe', 'Africa Unite', 'One\nDrop' 'Babylon System' and 'Wake up and\nLive'. The lyrics deal with the problems that\nthe black man faces today, as Marley sees\nthem, also the percussion and bass are\nconsistently good throughout although I felt\nthat the l Threes vocals were a little obtrusive\nsounding like the Shang ra Las' in places. The\nmany good points of this album far outweigh\nthe bad, the best part being (in this critic's eyes) the opening to 'Zimbabwe' - 'Every man\ngotta right/To decide his own destiny'-which\nsums up the basic message of the album.\nThis record is Bob Marley at his militant\nbest and is definitely a record worth buying,\neven if you don't like reggae.\nSimon Jerome\nSINGLES REVIEW\nSteve Hillage - Don't Dither Do It (Virgin)\nThe intro to this reminds me of that to Pink\nFloyd's 'Sheep' on Animals. In fact, the guitar\nbacking right through the record has a Floydian feel to it. However, that is where the\nsemblance ends. There is a continual drum\nbeat which could make it popular in discos,\nbut as it isn't very strong this could similarly\nbe good for a fair amount of radio play.\nThe lyrics are rather unimaginative, being\nmerely the title repeated over and over again;\nthe quality of singing is not particularly good.\nSteve Hillage should stick to guitar playing\n(at wh ci h he is exe mpl or ary) and release the\nbacking track.\nTo sum up, this is a reasonable single and\n'rocks along well', with excellent guitar but\nsadly disappointing singing.\nJeremy Nunns\nHistory is in the making\nQuork ! in a few seconds\nwill have some astounding\nthe Loch Ne*\u00bb\nthe scientific wo'l lost \u2022 \u2022 huh'1\nat the Edinburgh\nAna when I produce them\ns^m pos lorn\nId will\nA RW GH!

    "content": "EDITORIAL\nHappy Birthday to us! We're thirty years old\nand good for another thirty \u2014 at least!\nA long long term's glaring over a paste-up\nboard has not been in vain. Mistakes \u2014 I 've\nmade a few, but then again too few to\nmention....I did it my way! FELIX is alive and\nwell, but I still need people, people, people; as\nreporters, proof-readers and colla tors to\nmention but a few. All the issues I 've delivered\non Friday mornings have sold like hot-cakes,\nbut although it's great to see you read FELIX,\nwith the economic strains that have been\nimposed on the College as a whole, you're the\npeople who have to show that FELIX is\njustified in getting all the aid it can. And that\ngoes for everything else that keeps you amused in College. Go to the Devils this\nweek, go to the Ents Free Gig next Tuesday\nevening, but above all show that you care.\nIt's easy to criticise, but what can you offer as alternatives? If you've got some good ideas,\ncome and tell me, because you know what\napathy equals? Cuts! So be warned: Don't be\na dodo!\nThe Felix Society will hold its last meeting\nthis term on Monday at 12:45 in the FELIX\nOffice. Subscription to the Society is now\nfixed at 30p( cheap!). Come along and hear\nwhat's happened this term in FELIX and tell\nus all your ideas for next term.\nCREDITS\nAustin, Lars, Mark, Mary, Ian, Fred,\nMargaret, Jeremy, Paul, Archie Evans, Jill\nDawson, Dave Bryan and anybody else who\nwith true Christmas spirit has helped on\nFELIX.\nFELIX was born on 9 December 1949 as a fortnightly newspaper costing 3d. Its purpose\nwas, and still is, to comment on topical affairs\naround College, bring to attention the\nactivities of College members and also to\nentertain. It was felt that The Phoenix, the\nliter ear y magazine of Imperial, could not\nhope to fulfil these roles and should remain\nthe temp re mental bird it is, dying in some\nyears and rising gloriously from the ashes in\nothers. On looking through the first year's FELIX it is quite amazing how the paper has\nmaintained a constant image.\nThe first issue reported various events,\nincluding the arrest of sixteen people at the\nannual Rag Bonfire on the steps of the Albert\nMemorial. A Morphy Day report and a sports\nreview were supported by regular features\nlike the 'Diary of Forthcoming Events' and\nthe already controversial letters page.\nThe first six hundred copies sold quickly so\nthe second issue increased to one thousand\ncopies to avoid a black market. To quote the\neditor, EM Hughes: \"....and it was reported\nthat some sportsmen were offering their\ncopies to latecomers at 4d, and finding plenty\nof takers.\"\nHaving overcome the threat of a black\nmarket, the staff decided to include some\nregular features: 'Profile' and 'The Drinking\nMan's Guide To London'. The first subject of\n'Profile' was our own Union bar: \"....and in a few years its place in history was assured by\nthe formation of four clubs closely connected\nwith it and by its firm installation next to the\nlavatory. The 21. 22. Chaps and Links Clubs\nmade the Bar a congenial meeting place, a good talking shop, a place for warriors to\nreturn to tell the tale and lick the odd wound\n(from rag or honest game), and of course a place in which to liberate great exuberance -for such is the/o you s outcome of bi bulat ion.\" There was also a letter from the Ents\nChairman discussing methods of keeping\nnumbers down at the Saturday night 'hop'.\nIssue three indicated more diverse material\nwas being attracted: a crossword, poetry and\nan article on the emancipation of women. The\ntrend continued in future issues. By issue\nfour the accommodation problem was being\naired \u2014 issue 7, refectory prices and soon the\nvarious political societies were edging for\nspace.\nIssue 10 saw a new style FELIX; printed\nrather than duplicated on a Roneo machine\nas had previously been the case. A map of\nMNM L.W. H. College supplied to Freshmen gave particular\nemphasis to the local public houses. Times\ndon't change much.\nWith a new editor and new format the paper\nwas un doubt ably destined for better things.\nThe first anniversary issue summarised the\nstatus of FELIX very well: \"The end of the year\nfound the paper established as part of the\nCollege and recognised and constituted by\nCouncil as the official newspaper of IC.\"\nFELIX had emerged a great success, its\ncoat well groomed and as black as printers\nink. Now, thirty years later, we celebrate\nanother birthday. Perhaps it is best to look\nback at the personal view of the first editor,\nTed Hughes:\n\"Although the paper is financially\nresponsible to Council and exists by their\nconsent, it is free to express such opinions as\nit sees fit. The FELIX Board therefore carries a considerable responsibility for in the hands\nof irresponsible persons the paper could be a powerful and mischievous weapon. In the\nevent it would un doubt ably be suppressed,\nand I should be extremely sorry to see that\nhappen. I hope, therefore, that future FELIX\nBoards will bring new ideas and new life to\nthe paper, but will maintain essentially the\nsame spirit.\"\nHopefully we have kept true to these ideals\nduring the ensuing thirty years as deviation\nfrom these is inexcusable.\nHappy thirtieth birthday FELIX, long may\nyou continue!\nMARK SMITH\n11\n\n"

    "content": "CITY-AND GUILDS\nTime for the penultimate FELIX article of this term. Due to good\narranging there was a whole week to\nrecover from Carnival, some of us\nneeded this. By Sunday enough people\nhad recovered to participate in the\nrugby sevens. This was a good day out\nat Harlington despite the fact that some\nof the matches didn't turn out the way\nthat they were intended. TT won the\nplate and the women's team often fared\nwell despite some of the opposition not\nentering into the spirit of the game. The\nfood afterwards was good and the film was rather funny.\nThe nomination papers for Hon Sec\ncame down last Friday with only one\nname on the sheet, so it only remains\nfor Sara McGuiness to be ratified at the\nnext U GM. We will be requiring a new\nAssistant Hon Sec to be elected at the\nnext Gen Com in the spring term.\nAnybody who thinks they would like to\nstand should come and see Jo in the\noffice.\nFORTHCOMING EVENTS Saturday 8 is the Year Rag. This is the\nevent where all the years of Guilds\ncompete with each other to collect the\nmost money during the twenty-four\nhours between midnight Friday and\nmidnight Saturday. So come and collect\nthe cans on Friday from the Union Office if you want to start collecting at\nmidnight. There will be a half barrel for\nthe year that collects the most and\nanother for the year that collects the\nmost per head. We need a good turnout\nas RCS collected j \u00a32,700 last week. If you\nwant to start on Saturday be at the\nOffice at 9:30am( don't forget your\nlicences).\nSunday 9 is the Bar Games Night. This is a slightly more refined Bar Night.\nThere will be a selection of games such\nas cards, nine mans morris, dominoes,\ndarts, chess and many others. Singing\nwill also take place as well as a few\nquiet pints. Meet in the Union Bar at\n7:00pm. The Christmas U GM is at 12:45 in ME220 on Tuesday. Father Christmas will\nbe giving out press ies to the\nExec. Other things will also happen. In\nthe evening we will go carol singing in\nLondon with Scarf. Meet in the Union\nBar at 6:00pm for a really good evening.\nThere will be mince pies and punch\nafterwards in the Union Office.\nThursday13 we are going ice skating\nat Queens. Meet at the Union Bar at\n6:00pm. Friday is the end of term when we all\nget pissed and go home.\nAs this is the 30th anniversary issue I decided to look up some information\nfrom the last thirty years.\nDuring the 1950s Guilds were quite\nactive with large numbers turning up\nfor the events. Morphy Day was similar\nto today with more participation from the boys in blue especially when a brick\nwall was built across Putney Towpath\nand the trapping of an innocent\npan technic on. In 1958 Southampton\nUniversity stole Bo only to find the\npolice called in to get it returned as it\nwas as inviolate then as it is now. The\nold C&G building began to be\ndemolished at the end of the decade. In\n1961 the old wooden Spanner was stolen\nonly to be found three months later in\nthe left luggage office of a small railway\nstation near Koblenz in the Rhine\nValley.\nAlso during the early part of the 1960s a thirty foot Spanner was fixed to the\nside of the new physics building by\nsome mountaineering Guildsmen. It\ntook College two days to remove one\nnight's work. In 1963 we lost Spanner\nagain and at Morphy Day we won the\nMorphy and Lowry races and covered\ntwo police motorcyclists in flour and\ntomatoes.

    "content": "IC BILLIARDS AND SNOOKER\nCLUB\nOn Wednesday last, three teams of snooker\n'haven't quite made its' were supposed to play\nmatches. In fact a tragedy happened. The A team won 5-0 by default, fraud ing their\nopponents of what would have been a negligible ef for fa nihil ation like when Wales\nbeat England at rugby.\nThe C team played QM C at home. Our\nimmortal team were defeated 3-2. First to play\nwas our entrepreneur and raconteur buffoon\nDavid whose consist an cy kept up his zero\nrecord. Graham 'not Tony' Curtis floundered\nto the table next, bravely fighting off the US\nseventh army and the wobbled y gobbled y Damian 'Omen II' Kelly, in that order. So with\ntypical nitro glycerine stability D Kely\nfumbled his feeble wav to the cloth. Owino to\nthe fact, his opponent had a severe attack of\n'two left feet' in his hands, Damn found he was\nable to shake his wobbly cue to an\nunder es tima table win and a night win racq uel Welsh's mother. So at this point in the\nproceedings I approached the sacred cloth\nknowing that the night before I had attempted\nto break the'Fuller's passport knowing that\ncertain PAs in Physics 2 had done it in twenty\ndays (must be a record). Well I might as well\nhave drowned myself for the contrasting\nimpression I made on my opponent who\nknew I was the greatest snooker player\nanyone could ever know.\nThe B team played L SEA team away and\nalthough being as harmonious as a string less guitar, they won 4-1, the only loser being the 'I can't help complimenting you, because you\nkeep winning' Tomsk. The L SEA team's first\nplayer approached the table followed by our\nfirst player the rotund Simon Bennet, '\ndescribed by spherical coordinates his\nsnooker compares favourably with a flat pint\nof Albrights bitter (I'm a member of the AAA Albrights Apathy Association). Securely tied\ndown so as not to float away like a hot air\nballoon, he scintillating ly sent his opponent\nround the bend and won his first glorious\nmatch.\nNest on was Rasputin's grand son, Randy\nCrusewski who between swigs of Cossack\nVodka and the odd Ukrainian folk dance\npotted a few balls chanting KGB slogans like:\n\"I like a Gremlin in the Kremlin\" and \" Buy a one way return ticket to Moscow\". After this\nhis nervy opponent was finished and gave\nhim the game in return for (a visit to the)\nPolitical Assylum.\nWell, Steve Means Beans cautiously\napproached the table next, brimming with the\nconfidence of a religious Iranian. Well, not\nwanting to lose again and knowing the loser\nve as much chance of continued existance as\naDC10, he astonished the bewildered yet\nstupid audience and won.\nWhat a let down the next match was, Tomsk\nwho must be one of the best snooker players\naround, next to John Binden in drag, played\nlike he had a half starved ferret down his\ntrousers.\n. The final chapter of this boring saga of\nsnooker misery was completed by Alan 'I don't rip snooker cloths much' Leclezio, still\nlooking like an overweight Mosha Dayan with\nhis black eye, he confounded his o ppen ent with an exhibition of ture fairy ness. The\nproblem was, he saw 'Lord of the Rings 'atthe\npictures the night before and now knowing\nwhat a true Hobbit looks like he came in\nwearing a funny pair of feet and a rather\nstupid nose that made him look more\ngorm less than a roman nosed Toulouse\nLatrec. On this form winning was as usual\njust a formality, so the B team won 4-1.\nSAILING CLUB\nIC Sailing Club sailed their second league\nmatch of the season last Saturday, against\nOxford. Oxford brought a strong team and in\nthe first race, IC were 'caught cold' and easily\nbeaten. Race two started well for IC, and after\nthe first lap, they were in a commanding\nposition. On the final leg they fought through\nto take the first three places and so tie the\nscore with the final race to decide.\nThis race proved to be very close, with IC\ncoming through from behind to take the race,\nthanks to some excellent teamwork.\nThe standard of sailing within the team is\nimproving all the time and our chances of\nwinning the league now look good.\nTeam: John Williams (captain), James\nBaxter, Dave Culshaw, Colin Murray and\nCaolan Patterson.\nBUDWORTH PAIRS\nIC were invited to the Budworth Pairs\ncompetition last weekend along with London\nUniversity.\nCambridge fell to IC after a closely fought\nfirst race, but the second race was lost on the\nstarting line with West Kirby SC taking first\nand second at the finish. With the wind\nincreasing, gear failure marred the third race\nwith Chris Lewis and Alan Beany taking a ducking as their main sheet parted from the\nboom. The last race of the day saw a decisive\nvictory against Manchester University.\nAfter Saturday night's festivities IC sailed\nUL losing only on the last leg after having a winning position. With the chances of\nqualifying for the semifinals now diminishing,\nthe IC team sailed the remaining races with\ndetermination, but little success. IC were\nrepresented by lan Robson, Chris Lewis, Alan\nBeany and Carolyn Jaffy.\nUL having won our league were narrowly\nbeaten in a semifinal by Castaways after\nwinning the first race from the best of three.\nDave Derby and Geoff Titmus from IC were\nsailing for UL's team.\nTABLE TENNIS\nDue to the lack of quality humour in recent\narticles, I'm not writing this one....instead he\nis.\nHello, well after that succinctly instructive\nintroduction, batten down the hatches and button up your flies 'cos we're off!\nJust to celebrate FELIX'S30 th Birthday\n(perhaps het roof p reading will imp erve) IC\nmanaged a clean sweep of victories (yes, we\ngave every one the brush off) in league\nmatches, but lost their return friendly with\nQM C( more later abut the QuagMire Cretins).\nLet's deal with victories first:\nIC 1 vs Sarah Siddons (home): 7-2\nWith 'Rutherford Scattering' all his\nopponents before him, Kartick flabbergasting his, and Wild-Man-of-Borneo Hong\ntearing limbs and screaming incessantly in\nthe inaudible tongue of his native land, this\nslip of a girl....er, team stood not an earthly.\n(Phew!)\nIC 2 vs Dept of Employment (away): 9-0\nIt really was time the 2nds won again (this is\nthe second time) especially with an ex-Lebanese international and a Clive L! look-a like in the side.\nIC 3 vs BSC 33 Club 3 (away): 9-0\nBending British Steel before them like trees\nin a hurricane (quaint huh?), the thin\nreinforced their claim to the champions h and (the serious bit) only have to defeat\nHouse to be certain (I think) of the\nchampionship.\nIC 4 vs LUCS (home)\nWell the sandwiches were nice, but I don't like waiting an hour for a team, and the'-being told on the phone that the Chine\ncaptain has gone home for six matches!\nA joint mens and ladies tie ended with QW\nwinning the mens and IC winning their fir\never ladies match 4-2.\nYet again fielding a team without IC's be a half-dozen players (who only play for ULU)\nbut nevertheless a good team of regulars, IC\ngave Q MC's strongest trio a very good run\nlosing only 3-6 and taking almost every set to\nthree games. Special credit to Eze (2nd team\nIC only) who outshone even Kartik and\nKumar (well he looks so nice when he's playing) Singarajah. Each player won one\nset.\nEven better though were the ladies, C% Pang (not ChiChi Panda), Eva Somethi\nChinese and Aine all winning at least one set\n(the one from Eire \u2014 guess which \u2014 won\ntwo).\nIf you didn't enter the Hand ica0 Competition you don't KIIOW what\nmissed.\nI 'll be back next week \u2014 The Other Write\nPROF BREWS STRAHLUNG\nr: \u00a3?>\nHere Quark, cue observe\nthe common cold virus\nin action!\ny^^^ He j Prof!

    "content": "WEDNESDAY 28 FRIDAY 30 MONDAY 3\n257 LOST. IN DC 10 CRASH\nAn Air New Zealand DC10 crashed into a volcano off the coast of Antartica during a sightseeing excursion. There were 257\npeople on board and there were no signs of\nsurvivors among the wreckage spotted by US Navy planes.\nPRY FORUM OFFER\nThe National Economic Development\nCouncil was re-erected by Sir Geoffrey Howe\nas a major forum in which the Government\nmight be able to do business with unions and\nemployers. At the same time however the\nChancellor warned that pay rises at present\nlevels could lead to tax increases instead of\nthe tax cuts promised by the Tories.\nBSC LOSS THREATENS MORE\nJOBS\nThe BSC is expected to announce a half\nyearly loss of \u00a3150 million. It is planning fresh\nreductions in capacity and redundancies to\nmeet a deteriorating situation. The Corporation has been hit by a drop in demand\nof 15% and this has been aggravated by the\neffects of the Government's monetary\nsqueeze.\nTHURSDAY 29\nNO SUCCESS AT DUBLIN SUMMIT\nAt the EEC talks in Dublin the EEC countries rejected Margaret Thatcher's demands for a vast reduction in Britain's contribution to the EEC budget. The Prime\nMinister demands were for a reduction of \u00a31\nbillion as opposed to the reduction of \u00a3350\nmillion to \u00a3400 million which the other\ngovernments were willing to discuss. She\nwarned the meeting that their refusal risked\nprovoking a crisis in Britain's relations with\nthe E ED. The present budget imbalance\ncould mean that Britain would pay \u00a31,200\nmillion more into the EEC next year than it\nwill receive.\nUS RADIATION DAMAGE\nThe US Government have for the first time\nadmitted that radiation from atmospheric\natomic bomb tests in the South Pacific from\n1945 to 1962 may have caused cancer among\nthe troops exposed. The government\naccepted responsibility in a case brought by a former sergeant who is currently dying of\ncancer. It is estimated that 250,000 personnel\nand islanders were exposed to radiation in\n183 tests.\nResidents of a town in Utah are suing the\nGovernment claiming that a radio-active\ncloud drifted over their town causing\noutbreaks of Leukaemia. A Hollywood film\ncrew made a film in the same town and since\nthen its stars: John Wayne, Susan Hayward\nand Agnes Moorhead, have died of cancer as\nhave the director, production manager and\nwardrobe mistress. Some people are\nconnecting these deaths with the alleged\nradiation exposure.\nBRITAIN'S EEC BUDGET\nMrs Thatcher told her fellow EEC leaders\nto find an acceptable solution to Britain'sEE C budget demands or else face unilateral\naction by Britain to cut its payments which\nwould result in a European political crisis.\nMrs Thatcher left the conference empty\nhanded after a six month campaign to reduce\nBritain's payments admitting that there was\nlittle hope of a solution in the next few\nmonths.\nSHAH'S NEXT MOVE\nThe Shah said that he still intended to leave\nthe US despite the Mexican Government's decision to bar his return. He is said to be\nconsidering other offers of political asylum.\nConcerning the hostages, the sense of\ncrisis is deepening with no apparent way out\nof the impasse. The US ambassador at the UN acknowledged that it was unrealistic to\nexpect any action by the UN which would\nlead to a quick release of the hostages.\nSATURDAY 1\nTHATCHER'S EEC PLANS\nUnder the Prime Minister's orders, plans to\nfreeze Britain's relations with the Common Market go ahead. The plans are to be held\nready in the event of a final breakdown of\nnegotiations with the EEC over Britian's demand for a reduction in its contribution to\nthe EEC budget. The contingency plans are\nreported to cover everything short of a British\nwalk-out from the community.\nNO MORE DINKY CARS\nThe Liverpool factory which produces\nDinky cars is to close because of labour costs\nand lack of productivity. Meccano, owned by\nthe same company, face the same fate. In\nnearly 50 years history of Dinky cars 900\nmodels in crash-proof, die cast metal have\nsold in their millions. Collectors predict that\nthe present models will be snatched up and\ncarefully 'garaged' for their investment value.\nEarlier this year a model of a Pickford removal\nvan, sold for four shillings in the thirties, was\nauctioned for \u00a3340.\nSUNDAY 2\nATTACK ON US EMBASSY IN\nLIBYA\nThe US Government protested to Libya\nafter an attack on the US Embassy in Tripoli\nby a rioting mob. The mob included men in\nmilitary uniform according to the State\nDepartment. The attack came shortly after\nthe Shah had been moved from New York to a military hos pita i near San Antonio. For the\nfirst time the US Government admitted that it\nwas to help the Shah find somewhere to live.\nLADBROKE LOSES APPEAL\nLadbrokes, Britain's biggest games group,\nhas closed three of its West End casinos\nbecause the group's appeal against the loss\nof licence for the clubs has been rejected.\nLicensing magistrates had ruled in July that\nLadbroke was \"not fit and proper\" to hold\ncasino licences. The three casinos involved\nare estimated to have contributed half of\nLadhroke's1978 profit of over \u00a341 million.\nEvidence was produced which show that an\noperation had been set up to entice gamblers\naway from rival casinos.\nBBC DISPUTE SETTLED\nSettlement occurred after a peace formula\nwas worked out by the Broadcasting Union\nand the BBC. During the dispute 610\ntechnicians were suspended for staging one-day strikes and the BBC lost 123 programmes\nat a cost of \u00a32 million. Priority will now be\ngiven to the recording of Christmas shows.\nTUESDAY 4\nDOCTORS TO SPY ON MIGRANTS\nDoctors are being asked by the Home\nOffice and DHS S to help pool confidential\nfacts about health service patients suspected\nof being illegal immigrants. A consultant has\ncomplained to the BM A that private\ninformation was passed on by the DHS S to\nthe Home Office without the patients'\nconsent. The Home Office denied this but\nsaid that doctors have been asked to watch\nout for patients suspected of being jn eligible for NHS treatment.\nRHODESIA MEDIATOR SOUGHT\nA mediator is being sought to save the\nRhodesian talks from collapsing. The first\nmediators move came from the President of\nSiberia, in the form of a telegram to Mrs\nThatcher in his capacity as chairman of the\nOrganisation for African Unity. The conference is deadlocked on the framework\nof the ceasefire. Lord Carrington' s demanding straight acceptance by the PF\nleaders which they are unable or unwilling to\ngive.\nELEVEN PEOPLE KILLED AT\nROCK CONCERT\nWidespread drug taking, badly thought out\nticket arrangements and the late arrival of\nThe Who were the main factors for a stampede at a rock concert in which eleven\npeople were killed. The concert had been due\nto start at 8:00pm and those with numbered\nand reserved tickets were allowed in. The\nWho arrived at 8:30pm and as their warm-up\nbegan the teenagers outside began to panic.\nThe crowd surged forward and during the\npanic eleven people were killed and twenty\nseriously injured.\n9\n\n"

    "content": "OBSCURE ENGLISH or why say it in a few words when you can use two thousand\nOnce upon a time there was a young child\nwho wrote things like \"the cat sat on the mat\",\nbut society soon put a stop to that. After many\nyears of expensive education (probably\nincluding an Oxbridge degree) he started to\nwrite things like this:\n\"Mixed her edit a ment means a her edit a ment which is not a dwelling house\nbut in the case of which the proportion of the\nrate able value of the her edit a ment attributable to the part of the her edit a ment used for the purposes of a private dwelling is\ngreater than the proportion thereof\nattributable to the part used for other\npurposes.\"\nThis eye-glazing wonder of official prose is\nfrom a rates bill issued by Fareham Borough\nCouncil, and is presumably meant to be\nunderstood by ordinary mortals such as rate-payers. If you can't understand it you're in\ngood company. A Department of the\nEnvironment form for applying for help with\nloft insulation was so obscure that thousands of them had to be returned to the applicants\nto be filled in properly. One local council even\nissued a leaflet explaining how to fill in the\nforms, but no-one could understand that\neither.\nBut now, help is at hand in the shape of the\nPlain English Campaign. Armed ony with a shredding machine and infinite gall, they\ndescended on Parliament Square last\nsummer and managed to destroy large\nnumbers of illegible forms before being\nmoved on by the police. Their latest (and\n-slightly more constructive) effort is a glossy\nmagazine Piam\u2014^frg mk, dedicated to\nferreting out samples of gobbledygook and\nexposing them to the piercing light of public\npillory. Tenancy agreements are, of course,\nnotorious. Here is a fine example of the\nobscure English love of extremely long\nsentences and dislike of those fiddly little\nspots known as punctuation marks:\nSub-section (v): \"To permit the landlord or\nhis agents with or without workmen and\nothers upon giving reasonable notice to enter\nATIU-A EXPERT SAFEBLOWER, AT Yoo eS. \u00a3<2v/ tC\u00a3. \\ FoUMb THIS BtG, VAOLT; If U OO& HT \"HOST HAVE UQT5.

The\norganisers, Chrissy Maher and Martin Curtis,\nhave set up a 'Form Factory' to help local\nauthorities, government departments and\nother official bodies to recast their\ndocuments in plain English. A series of Plain\nEnglish Workshops are planned for next year,\nto provide crash courses for people working\nin public information. One person who would\nbenefit from such a course works at the\nDepartment of Employment. He uses a computer to write letters like this one, in\nclosely spaced capitals:\n\"To qualify for unemployment benefit you\nmust, in any one tax year, have paid as an\nemployed person a minimum amount of\nClass 1 contributions. The minimum amount\nrequired is that payable on earnings at the\nlevel of the lower earnings limit for that year .\nmuli tip lied by 25. For persons who claim\nbenefit early in their insurance life this\ncondition may be modified to treat as paid in\none tax year all Class 1 contributions paid up\nto the date on which benefit is claimed. If this\nmodification applies in your case it will have\nto be considered before the decision on your\nclaim was made. A similar decision will apply\non any claims for later days on which the\ngrounds of this decision have not ceased to\nexist.\"\nThis horror was brought to the attention of\nthe DOE, whose spokesman admitted, \"We,..\nhave been aware for some time that letters\nlike this can be difficult to understand.\" On\nthe urging of the Campaign, the Department\nis now working on an \"improved and\nsimplified version\".\nWhat the Campaign needs now are\nsamples of obscure English from official\nleaflets, forms, contracts and other such\ndocuments to use as ammunition. If you can't understand your form for rent rebates or your\ncar insurance policy, just send it to: Plain\nEnqlish Campaign, 78 Wiltshire Street.\nSalford, M7 OBD or if you're really keen,\nthere's a meeting at the Library Association, 7\nRidgmount Street, WC1 on Monday 10\nDecember at 2:00pm. Ilfdrd councillors couldn't understand a bylaw they were asked to pass, even though it\nhad been approved by their Highways\nCommittee and the Home Office. Part of it\nread: \"Provided that the by-law shall not\napply to any person riding a bicycle or\ntricycle otherwise than to the obstruction or\ndanger of any person lawfully using such\nfootpath if the person riding has lawful\nauthority so to do.\" Asked for advice, the\nDeputy Borough Solicitor admitted that he\ndidn't understand it either: \"I was hoping that\nno member would raise it and ask for its\nmeaning. The person who worded it left the\ncouncil a week ago.\"\nTony Jones\nROCK'N 'ROLL\nFor those of you who like heavy rock and roll\nbut did not go to the ICWA Disco last\nSaturday, I can only say that you really\nmissed out on something.

If you would like to help\nwith STOIC productions or have any ideas for\nSTOIC programmes, come to the TV studio\nor ring int 2637 and talk to Adrian Jeakings or\nGrant Richmond.\nTHE LAND WE LIVE IN\nEnvironmental Week started, naturally\nenough, with an introductory talk, which was\npresented by Tom Burke, an ex-director of\nFriends of the Earth. If you ever wondered\nwhat FoE actually does (and has done) then\nyou may have missed an excellent chance to\nfind out. He gave a view of the background to\nthe present day environmental movements\nwhich developed from the concern of our\nancestors about the preservation of footpaths\nand monuments in the 1890s. Today, after the rapid birth and growth of many environmental groups in the sixties, the\neconomic rather than altruistic pressures are\nbringing home to people the need for\nconservation.\nIt is not a crisis of capitalism as the\ncommunists would have it, nor is it a crisis of\ncommunism as capitalists call it, rather it is a crisis of society.\nThough energy is the most obvious and\nmost advertised, commodity that needs\nconserving there are many different aspects\nof energy production that need looking into\nThis is the function of the Standing\nCommission on Energy and the Environment\nof which Lord Flowers is a member. His talk,\ngiven later on the same day, gave a brief, but\ndetailed, explanation of this function\nStarting with the government's green paper\non energy policy they are now studying the\nvarious aspects of energy production, use\nand its environmental side effects. Their first\nreport, on coal, is due to be completed in\n1981.\nThough Lord Flowers' committee decided\nthat nuclear power could be left until late orf\ntheir list of1 energy sources for discus ii on Thursday week saw an almost full Physics\nLecture Theatre 1 waiting avidly for the\ndebate of this particular topic. They were not\ndisappointed. With Mr Brookes, economic\nadviser to the UK Atomic Energy Authority\nand Dr Goodard, known to Mech Eng as a lecturer, speaking for the motion and a professor from Hull University and Professor\nScorer of the Maths department speaking\nagainst the debate they discussed fully the\nvarious economic and safe y factors involved,\nthe Harrisburg disaster being a much quoted\nexample. At the end it seemed that the\nspeakers for had a solution to the 'energy\ncrisis' and the speakers against thought that\nthe solution was wrong and there might not\nbe a crisis at all. Both sides however seemed\nunhappy about nuclear waste storage and\nnuclear arms proliferation.\nThe discussion on the Chemical Aspects of\nFarming And Food Production was designed\nto encourage people to think whether that\nordinary lettuce leaf on their plate is really\ngood for you, seeing as, when commercially\nproduced, it is sprayed with a pesticide every\nweek of its growth and traces will always\nremain and the undertakers do very well out\nof preservatives in our food, they can now\nkeep dead bodies for days without\nref ridge ration or decay\nNow hands up those who like helping\nchildren. Now keep your hand up if you put\ntheory into practice. Yes, as I thought, most\nwent down again. Put you hands down the\nfew that are left and thank you for attending\nthe Adventure Fun Days at the weekend when\na playground was to be rebuilt and painted for\nLondon children with no other place to play\nexcept the streets.\nThe debate on what to conserve seemed to\nbe of interest only to 'conservationists'\njudging from the turnout, but the talks,\nespecially the one given by Mr Hookway of\nthe Countryside Commission were very\ninteresting and in some ways eye-opening.\nDid you know that IC destroyed a beautiful\n19th century square in order to build\nSouthsideV\nMr Hookway started with a quotation:\n\"What has posterity done for me?\" Perhaps\nthis sums up the attitude of IC students to the\nenvironment.\nAt the Environmental Fair on the other\nhand it was hard to judge the amount of\ninterest, but a lot of people did come for a look around. Societies, such as Friends of the\nEarth, the World Wildlife Fund, the National\nSociety for Clean Air and even the Vicotian\nPreservation Society were present. The\nCyclists Touring Club was of particular\ninterest to students since the London branch\nis trying to create 'bicycle ways' in various\nstreets in, London.\nIf you did not manage to attend any of the\nevents but are still interested in joining or\nfinding out more about any of the societies,\nhere are some addresses:\nFriends of the Earth, 9 Poland Street, London\nW1V 3 D G Nature Conservancy Council, 20 Belgrave\nSquare, London SW1X 8PY National Society for Clean Air, 136 North\nStreet, Brighton BN1 1RG Transport 2000, 40 James Street, London\nW1M 5HS Campaign Against Lead in Petrol, 63 Dora\nRoad, London SW 19 7HH The Soil Association, Walnut Tree Manor,\nHaughley, Stowmarket, Suffolk 1P3143RS.( They offer a special student membership).\nCyclists Touring Club, Cotterell House, 69\nMeadow Godlaming, Surrey\nNational Conservation Corps (South East),\nZoological Gardens, Regents Park, London\nNW1 4RY Town and Country Planning Association, 17\nCarlton House Terrace, London S W1Y5 AS Railway Development Society, BM \u2014 RDS, London WC1V 6XX The Victorian Society, 1 Priory Gardens,\nLondon W4 1TT or ask for Mary in the FELIX Office.\nMary Freeman\n12\n\n"

    "content": "THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION Friday, December 7th,1979 Issue No. 537\n\u00a31 million CUT IN BUDGET\nFELIX arranged a special interview last Tuesday with John Smith,\nthe College Secretary, to discuss how the cuts will affect Imperial.\nOne percent of IC's budget (\u00a3300,000) will\nhave to be saved this year and next year cuts\nin the order of \u00a31 million are expected. At the\nend of the next four years the budget of\n\u00a330 million may drop to \u00a327 million.\nRumours that major departments will be\naxed were dismissed by Mr Smith as he\nexplained that the College has not taken any\nspecific measures to freeze posts: \"When it is\nknown that a post is going to become vacant,\nthe College will look very carefully at that\nparticular area\". The History of Science\ndepartment, for example, has three\nacademics. Two are retiring and College is\nconsidering how best to organise the\ndepartment in the future.\nThe aim is to streamline the training offered\nat IC by merging courses that are duplicated\nin more than one department. However, there\nwill be many talks and discussions and advice\nwill betaken from outside before changes are\nmade.\nDUPLICATION\nA College working party is considering the\nadvantages of merging the two departments\nof Botany and Zoology. The chairs of both\nhave become vacant. Ideally, the merge, if it\nwere to take place, would be followed by the\nconstruction of a new building for the\ncombined departments of Life Sciences.\nHowever, there is no money for such building\nprojects.\nIn the example of Life Sciences, the first\nobjective is not to save money, but the priority\nis to come to a decision that makes good\nacademic sense. Of course, it is expected that\nmoney will be saved as a result. The\nelimination of duplication is the main theme\nof College's plans for maintaining academic\nexcellence within the cuts that are being\nmade to the annual budget.\nThe Rector has. said that in order to\nstrengthen the management structure of\nCollege so that it can cope with different\nfinancial ties it must not allow the traditions of\nthe past to impede good management in the\nfuture. When FELIX asked for details of how\nthe cuts would effect the Royal School of\nMines, Mr Smith said that if similar activities\nwere seen to be taking place in both City and\nGuilds and the Royal School of Mines, then\nCollege would ask 'do we need both\nactivities?': \"One should not diversify effort\nwhen wc don't need to spread scarce\nresources over a wider area.\" Mr Smith went\non to discuss the departments where courses\nare similar and mentioned that some courses\nin Mines and Aeronautics were close to those\noffered by Mech Eng.\n30th ANNIVERSARY\nISSUE\nMr Smith observed that it is very difficult to\neffect change but relatively easy to start new\nthings. At first it may be hard to pull people\ntogether who haven't been working with each\nother.\nIn order to save money changes will occur\nin all aspects of College life. The Rector has\nasked halls to reduce cleaning costs by\ntwenty percent. College windows will be\ncleaned twice a year instead of four times in a bid to save \u00a37,000. Water is metered at IC and\nthey are putting in a system to save water.\nWATER\nUrinals will stop flushing at a set time, say\n10:00pm, although on special nights they will\nhave to be left on for a longer period. Thought\nis being given to rearranging the Christmas\nterm to give a longer holiday, in order to save\nmoney on heating.\nWhen FELIX asked the College Secretary\nhow the cuts will effect IC Union, he replied:\n\"The Union will not be asked to bear cuts, but\nthey might not receive as much money as\nthey will need to cover increasing posts.\"\nReferring to the Rector's Commemoration\nDay address, Mr Smith said:'\"If the cuts\ndestroy what is good at IC ther <\n\\ is better that\nIC should go.\" However, he expected that\nthere was no danger of Imperial being closed\nand that implies that its excellence will\nsurvive. Imperial College is thought very\nhighly of and there are eight applicants for\nevery place at the College.\nPUBLIC IMAGE\nIn general, Mr Smith commented: \"IC\n' students are probably fairly staid and\nrespectable. There are occasional lapses in\ngood taste. People were very concerned with\nthis year's Rag Mag. The mag came at a politically bad time for Imperial. We must be\ncautious of our image and not get\ncomplacent. Imperial has its strengths and\nweaknesses and we must build on our\nI strengths.\"\n\n"

    "content": "REACTION TO LAST WEEKS MICRO ARTICLE\nI was interested to read Mary Attenborough's article in FELIX no. 536.\nMs Attenborough presents a scenario and\nthen just leaves it without pointing out its\nconsequences or how things got like that. I refer to her remark \"Of the people in work, we\ncould be left with a technocrat ic elite and\nde skilled masses.\"\nNo government would survive for very long\nif this state of affairs existed (except a regime\nlike the one in Cambodia which was prepared\nto kill off a large fraction of the population for\npurely economic reasons), as the \"unskilled\nmasses\" would 'revolt'.\nWhat is more interesting is how the\nsituation could get that bad in the first place.\nThe answer is that in this country it couldn't because of the way that the technology\nworks. Very few of the factory 'robots' which\nwill replace human jobs can do so without\nhaving been taught how to do that job by the\nhuman operator. Whenever a factory starts\nproducing a new item, the machines have to\nbe taught how to deal with them, by skilled\nhuman operators\nThere are very few paint sprayers, for\nexample, who would teach a machine to\nspray a chair if it meant the he/she and\nhis/her mates would be out of a job as soon as\nthey'd done it. So what is the answer: Hide\nv our head in the sand (the Australians have a lot of that)? No, chiefly because the chip\ngives a great chance to improve the\nenvironment, as I shall explain.\nThe answer is for the paint sprayer to\ncopy write his work, so that each time the\nmachine paints a chair the company pays\nhim, well actually not him, but a union who\ndistributes the money amongst the paint\nsprayers who are registered as working for\nthat factory.\nSo what to do with the time that used to be\nspent spraying chairs? Oddly enough, much\nof it will be spent painting chairs because :the\nguy who gets the next job is the best paint\nsprayer around, so every one keeps in\npractice.\nThe reason I say that micro s are going to\nimprove the environment is because economic policy of firms is based on\nreducing unit costs, conventionally this is\ndone by reducing labour costs, but if labour\ncosts are fixed (as above) then the only way to\nreduce unit costs is to use less resources,\nland energy, raw materials etc, and the r by doing all the things the environmentalists\nwant us to do.\nActually micro s aren't that clever either, the\nbrain surgery machine mentioned by Ms\nAttenborough couldn't deal with any thing it\nhadn't met before (well actually t's programmer, who would also have to be a brain surgeon) whereas the experienced\nhuman could, not for any spiritual reason but\nsimply because the data storage and data\nhandling capacity ofthe human brain cannot\nas yet be rivaled by any computer around\ntoday (or tomorrow).\nAny one who has written software for a real\nproblem will know that most of the skill is\ndefining the problem and selecting the\ncompromises( there are always compromises). The coding is a very minor\npart of the work, computers can do the\ncoding but none of the rest.\nSo my view of the future is of a society\nbased on skill not 'slog' where people do what\nthey are good at, and sell the copyright on\ntheir skill. I believe this future is inevitable,\neconomic and social pressures will ensure it\ngoes that way.\nIf you are frightened by, or even interested\nin micro s then come to one of the micro\ncomputer club meetings at 7:00pm on\nTuesdays. This week our illustrious editor is\ngiving a talk.\nTim Panton\nCOMPOSING\nMUSIC BY\nCOMPUTER\nBY THE FELIX EDITOR, COLIN PALMER\nSomehow they (micro club) managed to\nrope me into giving a lecture on Music\nComposition by computers. Before you turn\nto page 12 of this illustrious newspaper I promise not to bore you with detailed\ndescriptions of 12,000 line Pascal programs.\nFor those of you who remember my\nelection campaign for FELIX Editor, last\nMarch, you may recall a weird election poster\nbased on my experiments with computer\nmusic composition. Most programmers\ncreate games packages which use up large\namounts of units. In these days of cuts I believe one should write programs that create\nusable output rather than eat up units ....\nhowever the program had a6 hour CPU execution time and thus defeated the\nobjective of saving units (it was run over the\nsummer vacation 1978).\nIf you are interested in computer music\ncomposition then come to the Micro\ncomputer club next Tuesday (I don't know\nthe venue but I suppose it's in the Union\nbuilding?). To wet your appetite i 'll try and\ngive you a brief description of the main\nelements of the program.\nBefore composing music one has to write\nan output package that will display the notes\nin a readable format. It is useless trying to\ninterpret millions of numbers and symbols.\nFortunately several students have developed\nan attractive plotting package for the\nKingmatic plotter (a great device that also\nproduces attractive spiro graphic patterns).\nHowever, I decided it would be interesting to\ndevelop a package that would output musical\nscores on a line printer. After a few weeks the line printer was\nmerrily churning out single voice random\ntunes. I was not satisfied with just one voice\nbeing composed and set to work producing a program, that would output four-part\nharmony on the line printer!3 months and\n20,000 units later the pro gr tam began to run. It\nincluded a self-checking subroutine that\nneeded a checking routine to detect bugs in\nthe check program. Before long the first aim\nto produce a program that composed music\nhad been amended to producing a good\noutput package.\nI was able to compose some canons which\ncould never have been constructed by a human being because they had a mathematical perfection and harmonic 'fit'\nthat would have taken years to compose. The\nprogram was able to give a mark out of 60,000\npoints for each attempt that it composed. The\ncomputer stored the 'best' attempts and\nreproduced them at the end of the search to\nfind special canons. The ability for a machine\nto evaluate its performance smacks or\nartificial intelligence and that is one of the\nareas in which I next hope to write articles for\nFELIX.\nIf you'd like to see some of the output\nplease drop into the FELIX office.\nRCS CAROL SINGING\nNEXT\nMONDAY\nMEET RCSU FOR\nFREE PUNCH\nAT 6 p.m. PROF.

    "content": "IC\n.LIBERAL,\n/ CLUB \\\nOn Thursday 29 November, IC Liberal Club hosted a very successful\nmeeting with David Alton, Liberal MP for Liverpool Edge Hill.\nDavid, the youngest member of the House of Commons, spoke for\nabout half an hour on a wide range of issues under the broad title Britain\nNeeds A Liberal Government. His speech included the following points:\n1. That we need a system of proportional representation to end the two-party system and the endless pendulum-swinging that goes with it. The\ncycles of Labour nationalisation and Tory de nationalisation are\ndetrimental to the health of the nation.\n2. That we need greater workers participation in industry and they must\npartake in the profits of industry.\n3. That violations of human rights are occur ing all around the world. He\nseverely attacked Mrs Thatcher for continuing to recognise the regime\nof Pol Pot in Cambodia. This regime may well be the worst in the history\nof the world and was responsible for genocide on a massive scale but\nsf/7/ we continue to give the stamp of approval to it. He also referred to\nthe plight of dissidents in the USSR.\n4. That public spending cuts are a myth. In fact, total public spending\nwill be increased next year with large increases in defence and law and\norder. He attacked the government' ideological 'dismantling of the\nwelfare state' and the proposals contained in the Education Bill.\n5. That we need to invest more in alternative energy research. He\nmentioned that many buildings now derived their energy from solar\npanels.\nQuestions from the floor included one on David's attitude to the\nCorrie Bjll. He replied that he was against abortion for deeply-held\nmoral reasons. He was also asked about Liberal philosophy, and\nreferred the questioner to a cassette of the philosophy debate at\nMargate. At the Assembly, David had spoken on the 'Troops Out' motion\non Northern Ireland and he was asked about this. He replied that he had\nnever condoned the activities of the IRA and was looking for a negotiated solution involving the withdrawal of troops.\nCLUB NEWS\nIC Liberal Club has elected Philip Cole as Secretary and Ian Prosser\nas ordinary committee member. The annual dinner of the Club will be\nheld on Tuesday 11 December at the National Liberal Club. The cost is\n\u00a35.05 and anyone can come along (you don't even have to be a Liberal!).\nFinally, don't forget our informal meetings at 1:00pm on Fridays in\nStan's Bar.\nRichard Earl\nMetropolitan \u2014 Cammell, of Washwood\nHeath, Birmingham is Britain's last remaining\nprivate builder of rolling stock and as such\nwas the subject of a Railsoc visit on\nWednesday 28 November.\nInitially we had planned to travel to\nBirmingham on the 8:50 from Paddington,\nbut this proved impractical owing to\nrail cards not being valid on this train. To\nEuston therefore and journey hence to\nBirmingham on the 9:35 'Clansman'. At\nBirmingham we were due to wait an hour for\nSteve Clayton to arrive on the 10:40, this\nproved elastic as the 10:40 arrived thirty\nminutes late due to loco failure at Rugby.\nWashwood Heath works is currently\nengaged on building trains for three\ncontracts, the D78 stock for the District Line\nas well as trains for the Tyne and Wear and\nHong Kong metros.\nThe D78 trains represent quite a major\ndeparture from previous practice in London\nTransport surface stock. For one thing, it will\nbe the first time the District has recieved new\nstock rather than cast-offs from other lines.\nRAILWAY\nSOCIETY\nTORY REFORM GROUP vs MONDAY CLUB\nThe Conservative Society recently invited Mr Tim Smith (a member of the TRG's National Executive) and Mr Brian Rathbone (a solicitor and\nmember of the Monday Club) to take part in a friendly discussion about\nthe merits (or otherwise) of their respective groups. The TR G and the\nMC are pressure groups within the Tory party, the former on the left-wing and the latter on the right. They try to present alternative policies,\nput forward particular points of view and generally promote discussion\nwithin the party.\nGiving a brief summary of the development and beliefs of the Tory\nReform Group (founded in 1963), Mr Smith emphasised that there is no\n'right' answer to the problems facing us and consequently there is a need for organisations to put forward alternative views. No party should\nbe monolithic and it is foolish to rule out certain courses of action\nsimply for philosophic reasons: \"There is no room for dogma\". The\npower of any government to intervene is limited \u2014 this fact must be\nrecognised.\nReplying'for the opposition, so to speak, Mr Rathbone explained that\nthe Monday Club also dated from 1963; its formation was a response\nfrom members of the party who felt it was going through a bad patch and\nlosing sight of traditional Conservatism. In the early 1970s, everything\nwent wrong again, culminating in a \"richly deserved defeat\" in 1974 for\nthe Heath government.\nMr Rathbone expressed approval of the present administration, now\ntaking determined steps to reduce the power of the government \"....the\nhard disciplines which this country must endure because of\nmismanagement dating back almost to the end of the last war. This\ngovernment will maintain its policy with vigour until it gets results. It will\nhowever, take a long time to reap these benefits\".\nThe essential difference between the TR G and the MC was stated as\nbeing once of emphasis: a question of priorities. For the Monday Club,\nfreedom of the individual and traditional Conservative values were very\nimportant; for the Tory Reform Group, equality of opportunity.\nSome interesting comments were made in answer to questions from\nthe audience. On trade union reform, Mr Rathbone said firmly that the\nlimited reforms proposed were not enough; the power of trade unions\nwas quite frightening. He added: \"The true doctrine of monetarist\npolicies will not work if the economy is distorted by an agglomeration of\nunion power\". Both he and Mr Smith agreed that the 1976 act should\ncertainly be repealed.\nLess agreement was reached on electoral reform; Mr Smith said that\nhe had gradually moved round to favour the idea of some sort of\nproportional representation. When Mr Rathbone voiced fears of this\nproducing a 'soft centre' government and fragmentation of parties into\nsmall units, Mr Smith said he thought it would help to preserve some\nkind of political stability. Under the present system and with the rather\ngloomy prospects for the 1980s, he foresaw with some anxiety the\npossibility of diss at s if i ed voters swinging wildly from left to right and\nback, voting in different governments every five years or so, which\nwould be pretty disastrous.\nFurther discussion on schools and education was unfortunately cut\nshort through lack of time, and the audience dispersed, enlightened, to\nseek knowledge of a different kind.\nIC Conservative Society\nAn all-aluminium train, they have only four\nsingle leaf doors per vehicle and these are\nequip ed to be operated by the passengers by\nway of a button next to the doors. When the\nspeed of the train has fallen to a suitable low\nvalue, the guard can press a door release\nbutton to allow passengers to use the buttons\non the doors. Tinted glass is fitted, and a force-ventilation system is used with\ndistribution along the train by way of small\ncentrifugal fans. New trains are delivered by\nBR to their West Ruislip depot and the first\nD78 trains are now being used for crew\ntraining at Dagenham.\nThe Hong Kong metro cars are very\ndifferent to any in Britain. One feature\nimmediately noticed is their sheer size, they\nare seventy-five feet long and twelve feet\nwide, which gives them a capacity per car of\n450 including only 45 seated. The cars are\nmarshalled into six car trains, and one\nequip ed with overhead current collection,\nthis time 25 Kvac. The whole metro project\nhas been a really exciting engineering\nventure, involving the construction of a tunnel across the harbour, that is really a series of tubes sunk into position from the\nsurface.\nThe other activity at the works is bus-building. The standard bus built is the\nMetrobus as used by LT with all integral\nconstruction. This can take a variety of diesel\nena in es such as those by Rolls-Royce or\nGardner. The process of painting was rather\ninteresting, as was the method of moving the\nbuses around the works. An electric trolley\nwith jacking capacity is moved underneath\nthe front end of the bus, which is jacked up\nand the bus can be pulled along by one man.\nThe future of the company seems assured\nfor the moment with a full order book for both\nrail and road vehicles. Future new trains are\nto include the 1983 tube stock for LT's Jubilee\nLine.\nChris Veale\n16\n\n"

An extensive selection of French\nand German wines is available with token\nexamples from Italy and Yugoslavia. A folder\nwas prepared last session with some general\nnotes setting out the aims and aspirations of\nthe Wine Committee. The folder is designed\nto hold some wine lists, one for each of the\nmajor regions, and these have been updated\nrecently. Copies of the new lists can be\nobtained from the Refectory Office, ground\nfloor, Sherfield. Some of the wines and the\nwine list are to be put on display in the\nSherfield Building.\nMembers of the College are to be encouraged\nto experiment and to 'drink their way through'\nthe choices offered for each region. The\nCommon Room Wines have been shipped in\nbulk by the College direct from France and\nrepresent a better class of wine for the same\nprice than the usual 'plo nk' served in many a restaurant.\nIt should be remembered when studying the\nwine list that the prices are for use at College\nfunctions and these are to be compared with\nthose charged in restaurants for wines of\nsimilar quality. To assist members of the\nCollege with purchases for private use a discount of seven and a half percent is offered\nfor orders of six or more bottles, which can be\nmade for purchases of a single bottle of the\nfortified wines (Madeira, Sherry, Port) and of\nbrandy and spirits. Everyone is welcome to\nwiden their knowledge by buying from our\ncellars but stocks must be protected and substantial orders are not allowed. Stocks\nhave been laid down of some fine Bordeaux\nand Burgundy wines which need to mature\nfurther. The1978 vintage is still lying in\nBordeaux. Stocks of vintage ports, not shown\non the list, are very limited and are to be used\nfor special College occasions only. Stocks of\nthe Cockburn 1967 vintage are slightly more\nplentiful and this port is drinking very well.\nOrders can be placed with the Refectory\nOffice and should be collected within five\ndays of ordering.

Two minutes later IC opened their\naccount with a goal from a long corner. Phil\nWebb was the scorer with a sparkling display\nof stick work. The second half started well with an early\ngoal for IC. Chris Pound ended a good run\ndown the right by passing the ball across the\narea to Tim Mitchell who scored with a fierce\nshot. Ten minutes later Bank were back in the\nmatch with a well struck goal from a short\nPG TIPS If you are a postgraduate, you will probably\nhave received our questionnaire by now. I urge you\nto till this in and return it prompt y since there is\nnow a widespread appreciation in College circles\nthat PhDs take too long. The Registrar has agreed\nto compile statistics on the matter and if the\npostgraduate view could be accurately represented\nto him( and others;, Iam sure that some effective\ndiscussion could take place.\nThe PG Dinner was cancelled due to lack of interest. I ascribe three causes to this:\ncorner. However, IC fought back strongly and\nvictory was secured by a goal from Chris\nPound who this time collected a pass from\nTim Mitchell and placed his shot well. Mark\nTalbot's hard work was rewarded when, with\nfive minutes to go, he forced the ball past the\nkeeper to give IC their fourth goal. Any further attacking moves from Bank were\nscared off by Ralph Dean's slide tackles and\nthe game ended at 4-1 to IC.\nThe team was: D Moynham, R Dean, C Bird\n(Capt), M Clift, P Webb, J Watkin, C Pound, T Mitchell, J Ebner, M Talbot, D Woollard, D Benham (sub).\nOther results: IC 1sts vs St Bernards\nHospital: 0-6 and Bank of England 2nds vs IC\n2nds:42.

The first, against\nMiddlesex, was on 21 November and was won\nin a convincing style: 15-6, 15-5, 15-6. The valued points from this match helped us to\ngain a few places in the'Seetech League'.

In the evening, we returned\nto Putney with nine pint tankards, nine half-pint tankards and five men's medals together\nwith the Allom Cup for Men's Open Vllls and\nthe Roderick Hill Cup for Men's Senior C Vllls. Even more encouraging, was that the\n2nd VIII reached the final of the open event,\nproving that IC has two Vllls faster than any\nother London college. The results were:\nALLOM CUP (OPEN Vllls)\nIn the first heat, the Ist VIII raced against\narch-rivals and probably the only crew who\ncould beat IC, University College and\nHospital. Off the start, UC&H took an early\nlead, but could not get away from IC. As the\nrace progressed, IC found their rhythm and\nstroke by stroke, came back at them, and\neventually passed them and won by the\nnarrowest of margins: two feet. In another\nheat, the 2nd VIII raced the King's College 1st VIII. In this race, IC led from start to finish and\nwon by a comfortable one and a half lengths.\nThe final was between IC I, IC II and an VIII\nfrom London Hospital. London took the early\nlead but the 1st VIII soon found their rhythm\nand were in front by the half way point. At\nabout this time, bad steering by the Hospital\ncox caused a clash between them and the IC\n2nd VIII (who were level with them). This\ncaused the umpire to stop the race and\nLondon Hospital were disqualified. Our row\nthen took place between the 1st VIII and the\n2nd VIII and as expected the 1st VIII won by\nabout two and a half lengths.\nRODERICK HILL CUP (SENIOR C Vllls)\nThe 2nd VI11 were climbing up in this event\nand discovered that no other college could\nproduce a second VIII to match them, and\ncame away comfortable winners.\nNOVICE Vllls\nThis was the first opportunity for the\nfresher s to get a taste of racing. Their first\nrace was against Chelsea College and Guy's Hospital. They got off to a bad start, due to\nnot hearing the starter correctly and were\nnever able to make up the deficit. They lost by\nabout one length to Guys, who went on to win\nthe final.\nLADIES OPEN IVs\nWe entered two crews in this event. The A crew beat London Hospital A and QM C by\ntwo lengths and easily won their heat, while\nthe B crew had an easy win over London\nHospital B. In the final, the two IC IVs were\njoined by a crew entered as University\nCollege and Hospital. It turned out that the\nUC&H girls \u2014 a University of London crew\nand were actually competing in UL equipment. The race was very close with UL leading all the way but they were pushed very\nhard by the IC A crew. The final result being a win for UC&H by one length.\nLADIES NOVICE IVs\nIn their first race, our girls novice crew had\na very comfortable win over St\nBartholomew' s Hospital and Chelsea College. In the final, they set of slowly against\nQM C, but in the latter stages of the race,\nproved they had paced themselves perfectly\nby rowing through and winning by a half a length.\nTEAMS\n1st VIII: P Moysley, W Bradbury, J Urry, S Webb, M Fellows, A Rowe, P Gerrard, A Reynolds and I Simpson.\n2nd VIII: R Maddock, S Collier, E Hobhouse,\nC Adams, C Geary, P Allen, T Joslin, M Pritchard and S Crampton.\nNovice VIII: P Tebbutt, P Allen, S Allinson, A Purdy, R Redhead, J Marsden, P Mance, M Agnew and M Johnson.\nA Crew: A Toney, G Griffiths, N Ray, C Weir,\nand M Canvin.\nB Crew: E Lindsay, S Gray, J Pearson, A Burgess and W Partridge.\nNovice !V:J Jendrick, S Drane, H Johnstone,\nA Clough and M Canvin.\n18\n\n"

    "content": "An Energy Future\nfor Britain?\nMech Eng 220 was packed to capacity on\nThursday for the penultimate discussion to\nbe held in Environmental Week. Chaired by\nour Rector, Lord Flowers (who is also\nChairman of the Standing Commission on\nEnergy and the Environment) the speakers\nwere Nigel Forman (Conservative MP and\nauthor of Another Britain), Dr David Owen\n(Labour party spokesman on energy), Lord\nTanlow (Liberal spokesman in the House of\nLords on energy) and Michael Robson\n(member of the Science Policy Research Unit\nat Sussex University). Sir Derek Ezra was\nunfortunately unable to attend as he was '\n\"discussing with the unions\".\nLord Flowers gave a brief introduction\nstating the need to formulate a policy which\nachieves a balance between industrial\nconsumption and growth and conservation.\nThroughout the discussion it became clear\nthat Britain's future energy sources are 'Co-Co Nuke', Conservation, Coal and Nuclear\npower. Mr Forman emphasised that our\nusage of fuel d, especially nuclear, implies a 'Trade-off between generations'. The unfortunate difficulty being the difference\nbetween the 'life' span of a politician and time\ntaken for energy research into alternative\nsources to oil and gas.\nBefore we go ahead with nuclear power Dr\nOwen believes we should have a full public\nenquiry and debate, though, after the\nspeeches, a comment was made that not even\nthe experts can agree on the advantages and\ndangers of the various, if not all, types of\nreactors. He also believes that coal production should be increased and research\nshould be carried out into the various uses of\ncoal and other sources of energy and\nmethods of energy conservation.\nLord Tanlow put forward the merits of small\nurban coal fired power stations with district\nheating systems and also the electrification\nof railways as a useful way of decreasing oil\nconsumption, since eventually cars will\nbecome too expensive too run.\nMichael Robson looked at more specific\ndifficulties in each of the fuel uses. He\npointed out that nuclear plants suffer from\ntechnological faults which cause delays and\nincreased expenditure which can ruin any\ngovernment's forecast, and that is also\nfoolish to go ahead with the development of\nthree different types of reactor (PWR, AGR ENVIRONMENTAL WEEK Dr.David Owen,Nigel Forman\nM.P. and The Lord Flowers.\nand Fast Breeder) at the same time. There isa\nneed for slow adjustment which gives the\npower.plant industry steady work over a larger number of years. The difficulty with\ncoal is that it is dirty and firms using gas and\noil are unlikely to return to coal, though\nobviously industries (such as pottery and\nsmelting) cannot anyway.\nMany interesting points were raised in the\nbrief time that was left for questions such as\nabout the wastage of three quarters of the H~ coal used in power stations due to insufficient\nconversion and, when asked about the need H for Fast Breeder Reactors, Dr Owen replied H that the dangers of bombs being made from H the plutonium have been over emphasised H and that there is definitely a need for a public H enquiry since \"politicians cannot make these H decisions\". They need help from technicians.\nMary Freeman\nPhoto by Colin Pair\nPhoto by Colin Palmer\nRag Queen,Viv Brown Photo by Colin Palmer Photograph of tonight's Pyjama Party\n\n"

    "content": "THE HEINEKIN BENEFIT OR\nHOW TO CLAIM RENT\nDURING THE VACATION\nWHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?\nSupplementary Benefit \u2014 known as the\nHeinekin Benefit because it reaches the parts\nthat other benefits do not reach \u2014 is probably\nthe most productive method of recovering the\nrent that you have to pay over the vacation.\nSupplementary benefit is a top-up benefit\nwhich aims to bring anyone who is\nunemployed up to minimum level of\nsubsistence and is payable even though you\nhave never paid any National Insurance\ncontributions.\nSupplementary Benefit consists of two\ncomponents, a living allowance and a payment to cover the cost of your\naccommodation. In calculating your entitlement account is taken of other\nresources that you may have available.\nThese include Unemployment Benefit,\ninterest on savings over \u00a31,200 and, most\nimportant of all, the vacation element is taken\ninto account even if you don't actually receive\nit, eg because your parental contribution isn't paid in full.\nWILL I BE ABLE TO CLAIM IT?\nTo qualify for supplementary benefit for\nrent during the vacations you have to satisfy\nthe following requirements:\n1. Be unemployed.\n2. Be available for work.\n3. Be prepared to sign on in London once a week during j he vacation.\nIf you are not thinking of staying in London\nduring the vacation, don't despair because:\n1. Depending on where you will be staying, it\nmight be worth coming up to London once a week to sign on.\n2 The benefit office may be closed for public\nholidays on one or more of your signing on\ndays.\n3. You may be able to persuade them to give\nyou a 'holiday form' which effectively excuses\nyou from signing on.\nHOW MUCH WILL I GET?\nThis can get a bit complicated. Firstly, there\nis the fact that there are, in practice, three\nrates at which benefit is paid. Secondly, the\nDepartment of Health and Social Security\nmay feel that you are paying too much rent\nand only reimburse you to the extent of what\nthey consider to be a reasonable rent. The different rates are for three different kinds of\noccupational status:\n1. Householder\n2. Non-householder\n3. Flat share r There isn't actually a proper definition of\nwhat a householder is, but in general terms it\nis someone who is responsible for outgoing s such as electricity bills and so on over and\nabove the rent, while a non-householder is\nusually thought of as someone who just pays\nrent and has no other financial responsibilities towards his accommodation.\nA householder gets some extra money\ntacked onto his living allowance to cover\nthese extra responsibilities and pay for things\nlike standing charges on service bills. A flat\nshare r is treated as a part-householder and\ngets a share of the householder addition,\nwhich depends on the number of .people in\nthe flat. The rates at which supplementary\nbenefit is paid are as follows:\nHouseholder \u2014 \u00a318.50 per week\nNon-householder \u2014 \u00a314.65 per week\nNon-householder \u2014 \u00a31.70 per week\nrent allowance\nFlat share r \u2014 \u00a314.65 plus (\u00a318.50 - \u00a314.65\ndivided by the number of people in the flat).\nThe non-householder rent allowance is\npaid to people who are not paying rent eg if\nthey are living rent free with relatives.\nEXAMPLES\n1. Harry has a place in hall and is going home\nduring the vacation so he isn't paying any\nrent. His requirements are \u00a314.65 (non-householder living allowance) plus\u00a31.70rent allowance which totals \u00a316.35. His resources\nare \u00a316.35 vacation element. As his\nrequirements equal his resources, he will end\nup with nothing.\n2. This time, Harry is living in a beds it with a coin-slot meter paying \u00a315 per week rent. If\nhe goes home and claims there, he will only\nget a \u00a32 per week retainer (owing to an\narb it ary and discriminatory policy invented\nby the DHSS). If, on the other hand, he stays\nin London and claims or at any rate can sign\non each week, his requirements will be\u00a314.65\nplus \u00a315 rent which totals \u00a329.25. His\nresources are \u00a316.35 (vacation element) so\nhe ends up with \u00a313.30 per week. If Harry had\nbeen classified as a householder he would\nhave got \u00a318.50 plus \u00a315 less \u00a316.35 which\ngives him \u00a317.15 per week \u2014 \u00a33.85 per week\nmore.\n3. Supposing that Harry was sharing a flat\nwith three others and paying the same \u00a315 per\nweek rent. He would then get what he got as a non-householder ie \u00a313.30 per week plus a quarter of the \u00a33.85 householder addition.\nThis would give him \u00a314.28 per week.\nWHAT IS THE PROCEDURE FOR\nCLAIMING?\n1. Ring up your nearest DHS S office which\nyou can find under 'Health' in the telephone\ndirectory. Book an appointment with them for\nsay, the first day of the holidays (if you ring\nthem up now they may send you a form which\nmay or may not make things easier). While\nyou are talking to them ask which Job Centre\nand Department of Employment office you\nshould go to and check on the documents\nthat they will require you to bring to the\ninterview. (They usually want to see proof of\nyour savings eg bank statement and savings\nbooks and proof that you are paying rent eg\nlease or rent book. A handwritten letter from\nyour landlord is unlikely to be accepted\nexcept under protest.)\n2. Go to the Job Centre and look for a job.\n3. Next, go to the Department of Employment\noffices and sign on as unemployed.\n4. Turn up for your interview.\n5. Sign on each week as instructed.\nWHAT DO I DO IF THINGS GO\nGO WRONG?\nIf they won't pay and you think that they are\nin the wrong, you have 21 days in which to\nappeal. This doesn't cost you anything and\nsimply means that you tell them that you are\nunhappy with their decision (s) and wish to\nappeal. The case is then reviewed by a supervisor in the office and if they still think\nthat they are right it is passed on to an\n'independant' appeal tribunal.\nYou can get help with the tribunal hearing\nfrom the Welfare Centre. If any of this articles\ndoesn't make sense, you can always come up\nto the Welfare Centre and ask me about it.\nFinally, a word of warning, if you make a claim for supplementary benefit you have to\nsign on as unemployed which means that you\nare claiming unemployment benefit. Because\nof the 13 week rule, a claim now means that if\nyou have earned over \u00a3438 in one tax year you\nmay have an entitlement to unemployment\nbenefit next year which a claim now could\nendanger, alternatively a claim now could\nmean that you will be able to if you hadn't claimed. If you are not sure how you stand on\nthis, it might be better to check with the\nWelfare Centre before you claim.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\nDHSS OFFICES\nActon (covers part of Hammersmith): 743-9131\nBalham: 673-7722\nBattersea: 228-6454\nBrixton: 274-7777\nChelsea/Fulham: 736-3399\nKensington: 603-4633\nWestminster: 834-8433\nT How does be expect Brains 1\n(ike me to force back the\nfrontiers of Knowledge\nwithout decent working\ncond if c ions \u2022 \u2022 \u20220\nPROF BREMSSTRflHLUNG\nHANDS OFF THAT.

    "content": "RAMBLING THOUGHTS OF AN AG IMG FOOL\nHello All! Well deep in the heart ofthe\nUnion Store Room( barrel and gnome\nemporium), things have been just\nrolling along.-As I said last time, the\nterm is waning e 'en as I wax\nin eloquently. Iam absolutely shattered\nand I feel that the week or so of\nChristmas hol s will come only too soon,\nif not too late.\nSo you've survived Rag Week and\nEnvironmental Week, both of which\nhave taken months of planning by a few\npeople. You probably turned up and\nwent away with neither a thought or a care for the people like Roger and Rae\nwho spent dozens of hours for every\none hour of the event, but now I bet you\nfeel really guilty!\nI would like to add to my defence with\nregard to a motion passed concerning\nmy non attendance at University Challenge in Manchester: I was elected\nto represent the Union at the Student\nResidence Committee, who were discussing rent levels for next term( something I consider very important).\nI stand by my decision to attend that\nmeeting, so Yah Boo Sucks!\nGOOD NEWS The Rector has decided to ignore the\nrecommendations of the aforementioned Residence Committee and will\nbe recommending no change in the rent\nlevels for next term. Because of this\nthere will be no open meeting of Hall residents.\nThe last U GM passed a motion forming a Cuts Campaign Committee.\nThe first of its events will be a leafletting in the tube TODAY. Party\nleaves at 4:30pm( prompt) from the Beit\nArch. AT LAST: THE END With cuts and slashes wounding all\nand sundry in education it is nice to\nknow that when it comes to the crunch there is always an escape. Come to\nthink of it, that's a slash and cut as well.\nHappy Birthday FELIX, and Colin,\nplease don't worry about the lunacy of\nan aging fool,\nxxx Sir H C%y al College of\n)a en ceni on RCS\nLast Saturday's year collection saw\nLife Sciences 1 live up to their usual\nreputation of apathy. This was an\nattitude which was epi tomis ed by\nAdrian Black who when asked to go out\nfor the fifth time in twenty four hours\nrefused on the grounds that he had\nalready collected over \u00a3100. Such was\nthe extent of this attitude, that they\nwere too idle to collect the extra\n\u00a380.12i/2 needed to make their total up\nto \u00a31,000.\nEnough of this false modesty, they\nwere great really (even if the author is\nsomewhat biased) and led the way in making the RCS year collections the\nmost successful ever with a final total\nof \u00a32,636.12i/2. The top five year groups\nbeing:\n1. Life Sciences 1 \u2014 \u00a3919.87i/22. Physics 1 \u2014 \u00a3656.89i/23. Chemistry1 \u2014 \u00a3515.51\n4. Maths1 \u2014 \u00a3237.32i/25. Maths3 \u2014 \u00a3130.19i/2 The latter insist that they would have\nwon if their cover had not been blown in\nFELIX two weeks before the event.\nAs ever, the day produced an elitist\nclique who collected over one hundred\npounds in the day: Steve White (CI),\nAlan Edwards( part-time CI), Jane\nLavers (LSI), Tom Hayes (LSI), Adrian Black (LSI), Andy Needham( el), Mike Booty (Ml) and Steve Sleight (el).\nThe day was a credit to many people,\nespecially the first year social reps as\nwell as to Tansey and Mo who were\naway from Beit 75 for over eighteen\nhours!\nGeneral Committee on Monday prepared the way for next Tuesday'sU GM which will be held at 12:45pm in\nPhysics Lecture Theatre 1. There will be\nmince pies and free beer from the\nThree-Handed Pot, as well as the long\nawaited tr il of Zoshia.\nAlso next week are several not ab social events, which are as follows:\nTUESDAY: Life Sciences Christmas Party in J CR at 8:00pm.
