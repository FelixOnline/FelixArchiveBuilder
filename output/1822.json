This week the letter is from an\nanonymous PhD student in the Department of Computing who is\nstruggling to balance her hobby with her work.\nDear Hachel,\nI am usually a law-abiding plant mum but am currently charged\nwith criminal trespass, breaking and entering and armed robbery.\nWhat the police don\u2019t seem to understand is that I was just taking\nsome really interesting cuttings and really didn\u2019t do anything\nwrong. Could you please give me some advice on how to avoid\nscuffles with the law in the future?\nAnon\nDear Reader,\nDon\u2019t worry! This is a situation we plant\nlovers have all been in. I remember in\nmy early days of keeping plants I used to\nregularly be confronted by home owners\nwho wanted to know what I was doing in\ntheir front rooms at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. However, I soon\nlearnt a few tricks that you can use to stay out of trouble and\nstill get the cuttings you need to further clutter up your tiny\nbedroom. Rule number one, don\u2019t take your cutting shears with\nyou when you break into people\u2019s houses. If you get caught, this\nwill lead to a more serious charge of burglary with a weapon.\nInstead, immediately after breaking in, go and take a knife or pair\nof scissors from the kitchen. That way, you can claim self defence\nin court if you get caught. Secondly, burglary is not always the way\nto go! Blackmail and threats can be just as effective in getting the\ncuttings you need. I remember one time I photoshopped an image\nof a man that had a really nice Monstera Standleyana to make it\nlook like he was abusing his children. After I threatened to send it\nto social services he sent me the cutting I wanted in under a week!\nFinally, my most important tip is to have fun! Keeping plants is\nmeant to be relaxing and if you ever find that your hobby feels\nmore like a job, then you need to take a step back and remember\nthat feeling you felt as you slipped your arm through someone\u2019s\nletter box in order to pinch a hydrangea for the very first time.\nHappy hunting, and keep reading\nHachel Rope\nAgony\nPlant\n\n"

Well,\nthe leads emailed the head of Microsoft\nin Europe, and the rest was organised\ninternally by Microsoft. I had the\nincredible luck to attend that\nevent and I learned that Power Apps (you may have seen\nit used for the Shuttle Bus\nto White City and Hammersmith) allows you to\ncreate an app as easily as a\nPowerpoint presentation.

Yes, you\ncan also see them on Youtube, but can\nyou meet the speakers yourselves and introduce yourself? Via Youtube, no. Via\nGDSC, yes. One member spoke with\nthe presenters from the London-based\nstartup CORD and landed an Engineering Management Internship with them.\nCoincidence? No. The second side of\nthe GSDC is how they organise a mentorship program that helps professionals\nfrom BBS, The Times, and JP Morgan\nmentor students at Imperials.

Felix is our\nside-hustle, and while we knew what\nwe were taking on when we committed\nto our roles, it has been a manic\nmonth with many steep learning\ncurves! Ultimately however, working\nthrough the chaos that is a student\nnewspaper continues to be rewarding.\nThe response to the \u2018Blackett blues\u2019\narticle has been astonishing, from the\nbuzz that it caused among students\nin the Physics department to the\nresponses from faculty members\nand alumni. It is this kind of impact\nand engagement that we hope to\nachieve consistently. Admittedly, it\u2019s\nsatisfying to see our names in print\nand have our words published, but\nour writers, illustrators, and editors\nwouldn\u2019t be doing the work we do if\nwe didn\u2019t believe that on the other\nend is a student just like us, reading,\nlearning, and being entertained.\nThis week\u2019s issue is a stellar example\nof section editors taking the reins and\nusing Felix as a means of educating\nand inspiring, having not just one, but\ntwo, pull-out sections.

    "content": "23rd\nFebruary: Air\nBriefing paper launch: tyre wear particles are\ntoxic for us and the environment\nImperial\u2019s Transition to Zero Pollution initiative\nused Sustainability Week as a platform to publicise their new report, about how the friction between vehicle tyres and the road generates mi-croplastics that may be more harmful than their\nexhaust emissions. This means electric vehicles,\nwhich generate more tyre wear microplastics\nthan petrol or diesel vehicles, could be generating a new set of ecological and health issues.\nDr Marc Masen from the Department of\nMechanical Engineering\nstarted the event with\nthe story of how\nthis briefing paper started. He\nshared an interesting timeline on history of tailpipe\nemissions,\nand a possible transition\nto tyre wear\nbeing dominant\nvehicle pollution. Professor Robert Shorten then\nstarted the panel discussion. He emphasised\nthat tyre wear pollution cannot be solved at the\nindividual vehicle level \u2013 it will take policy ac-tion, and societal change in driving style and car\nchoice. Professor Shorten also commented on\nthe intersection between accessibility and transport \u2013 for example, only those who can afford an\nelectric vehicle and the extra electricity cost of\ncharging it are allowed to travel in London\u2019s expanding Ultra Low Emission Zone. Next to speak\nwas Professor Terry Tetley from the National\nHeart and Lung Institute. Her research focuses\non how particulates affect\nthe lung, so\ngave details\non how differently sized\ntyre wear particles damage\nthe lung in different ways.\nDr Stephanie\nWright from\nImperial\u2019s School of Public Health then outlined\nthe chemical composition of tyres, and how\neach chemical can have its own ecological and\nhealth impact. She highlighted the mass salmon die-off on the US Pacific Coast caused by\ntyre wear pollution \u2013 salmon metabolise one of\nthe compounds in tyre wear microplastics into\nquinones that cause oxidative stress. Then the\nfloor was opened for questions, which experts\non tyre wear in the audience answered as frequently as the panel did. It was inspiring to see\nso much knowledge from so many disciplines\nconverge to tackle this understudied pollution\nsource.\nYou can help out by: giving the pollution impact\nof your next car as much thought as price, looks\nand features.\n\u201cI will soon have\nan electric car,\nwhether that\u2019s\ngood or bad, I\ndon\u2019t know\u201d\n- Prof Terry Tetley\nCredit:\nEnvato\nElements\nix\n\n"

    "content": "Those acquainted with my reading taste would\nknow that thrillers, or any genre fiction books\nfor that matter, generally aren\u2019t my forte. I have been\na staunch literary fiction reader since I was 15, and yes,\nI know how pretentious that sounds. That\u2019s not to say\nthat I haven\u2019t read or enjoyed thrillers before; I\u2019ve read\nsome James Bond novels, and they were pretty good\n(all problematic sections aside), and the Alex Rider\nseries was literally crack cocaine for eight-year-old me.\nThrillers, and genre fiction by extension, rely too much\non tropes and clich\u00e9s, and this quasi-predictable nature\nturns me off from the genre. I feel that the end-goal,\nor purpose, of literature is to provoke new thoughts\nand perspectives, or to articulate something in a new\nand novel way. Genre fiction is purely literature written\nfor its own hedonistic end. I think it\u2019s important to\nestablish this, so that you understand my biases and\nknow that while I am not naturally inclined to read\nthrillers, I do understand the genre. Nevertheless, when\nour Books editor requested me to read and review The\nChase, I was more than happy to do so; after all, she had\nsaid it looked promising.\nThe premise is exciting \u2013 it\u2019s a tight story with high\nstakes and lots of twists and turns. Narratively, it\nweaves between titular character Emma Makepeace\u2019s\npast and present, constantly keeping the tone nice and\ntense. It is genuinely thrilling, and I was surprised at\nhow quickly the first hundred or so pages flowed.\nEmma, the protagonist, is a compelling character with\na strong motivation and a likeable disposition. It is\nextremely refreshing to see a female main character in\nthe thriller genre, where women are often subjected\nto being secondary characters, or reduced to sexual\nobjects; it\u2019s one of the elements that originally drove\nme away from the thriller genre. Her motivations are\ncogent and compelling. The trope of the \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019\ntough guy, which makes me physically gag, has birthed\nsome of the blandest characters in literary history;\nmost of the time these characters are\na circle-jerk for the rugged American\nlibertarianism that pervades the deep\nundertones of many a thriller novel.\nOne of the best aspects of this book\nis that Glass resolutely gets rid of\nthe male power fantasy aspect of a\nconventional thriller.\nThe characters are good, with\na conventional yet well-rounded\ncast of mostly detailed characters.\nMakepeace is a badass, and the action\nis taut yet believable, although one\nthing that did irk me was the fact that\nMakepeace often sounds like she has\nimposter syndrome when in a fight.\nTo me, the odds are emphasised too\nmuch, because what we learn about\nMakepeace throughout the book\nproves she is more than capable of\nhandling herself.\nI did a little bit of spy work of my\nown; Ava Glass is the pseudonym of\nC.J. Daugherty, an American writer\nbased in the United Kingdom.\nDaugherty has previously had success\nwith her best-selling Night School\nseries. Her oeuvre comprises mostly\nyoung-adult novels, although she has\nventured into crime with her Harper\nMcClain series. The Chase, and all\nsubsequent Alias Emma books seem\nto follow this new thriller direction,\nlargely based upon Glass\u2019s time as a communications\nconsultant for the Home Office. The young-adult\ninfluence is obvious in the novel\u2019s prose; it lacks\nsophistication, with an almost non-existent flow. It\u2019s\nnot melodic, but it\u2019s not utilitarian either. Whilst\nlanguage in thrillers is often simple and easy to digest,\nthis falls more into the category of bad prose and\nwriting than just simplicity. Words have a puerile tone\nto them; the lexical choices that Glass makes speak to\na younger audience than me and to a more American\naudience as well. Secondly, the dialogue is beyond\nclich\u00e9; I would read aloud the worst offenders to my\nfriends as they worked, only to hear collective groans.\nWe may sound like the most insufferable people ever,\nbut never again do I want to see the words \u2018creaming\nyour drawers\u2019 again in print.\nIt\u2019s jarring because the plot and its beats are good,\nbut the reader gets knocked away from the action by\nthe childishness of the writing. Over the course of the\nbook, the writing does improve, but at the outset it is\nvery jarring. Towards the end there is some engaging\nprosethatIcouldreallyappreciateinitseloquence,and\nthat was extremely satisfying.\nOverall, The Chase is a strong opening novel from\nAva Glass, and unmissable for fans of the young-adult\nandthrillergenres.However,forthosewhowantamore\nsophisticated and mind-bending thriller, this isn\u2019t for\nyou. Despite its shortcomings, it is extremely gripping\nand action-packed, and a novel that can definitely be\nread in one go. I did have an enjoyable time reading\nthe book; despite my objections, it\u2019s still really good.\nI would read other titles by Glass, and I wouldn\u2019t\nmind finding out more about the adventures of Emma\nMakepeace.

    "content": "Solutions to save a dying planet\nWednesday started\nwith a panel discussion bringing\ntogether academics\nfrom all of Imperial\u2019s\nfaculties. First, Dr\nBonnie Waring from\nthe Grantham Institute outlined the severity and complexity of the ecological\ncrisis. After showing\ngraphs on extinction\nrates and causes of\necological damage,\nDr Waring explained\nthat picking the\nright solutions will\nsolve the climate\nand biodiversity crises simultaneously.\nOne such solution is\nurban green spaces \u2013 PhD research-er, Richard Belcher from the School of Public Health, described\nhow green spaces improve physical and mental health, but not all green spaces are created\nequal. Then, Dr Boskovic presented findings from\nthe euPOLIS project that she works on. The project explores perceptions of green spaces in four\nEuropean cities, and combines that with knowledge of local climate and biodiversity to find the\nperfect nature-based solution for each city. The\nfourth speaker was Dr Pernille Holtedahl from the\nBusiness School\u2019s\nCentre for Climate Finance &\nInvestment. She\ndescribed the discrepancy between\nthe economic value\ncurrently given to\nundamaged natural habitat, and the\nvalue they actually possess \u2013 because biodiversity\nwith no economic impact is often ignored. The\ntalks were closed\nby Haleema\nMisal, a postgraduate from\nthe Centre for\nEnvironmental\nPolicy who was\npart of Imperial\u2019s\nCoP15 delega-tion. After reviewing the failures of previous biodiversity conferences, Ms Misal described the\n\u201coverwhelming\u201d emotions she felt at CoP15 \u2013\nespecially as an agreement between so many\ncountries was reached so late at night.\nYou can help out by: researching the climate\nand biodiversity policies of election candidates\nbefore you vote.\nA Changing Planet seminar: \u2018the mathematics\nof climate tipping points\u2019\nThe seminar by Dr Ivan Sudakow, an applied\nmathematician at the Open University, was an\nengaging listen. He spoke on nonlinear and stochastic theories and their applications in modelling climate progression, touching on the fractal\ngeometry of Arctic melt ponds, Markov Random\nField models, and climate-biosphere coupling,\nto name a few of the maths-heavy concepts\nmentioned in this seminar.

This is\nalso the first time in over 20 years that a\nnon-Oxbridge team has taken home the\ntrophy. This year\u2019s BSQC was hosted inside the City & Guilds Building on Saturday4March;Imperialwasrepresented\nby a total of three teams, featuring both\nnew and experienced quizzers.\n24teamsfromatotalof11UKuniver-sities participated in this year\u2019s BSQC,\nmaking it the largest student quiz tournament in the country (that is, the largest one that doesn\u2019t air on BBC Two on\nMonday evenings). This year marked the\n25th anniversary of BSQC, having first\nbeen held in 1998 at Imperial, and then\nhere every year since 2011.\nThe Imperial A line-up once again\nconsistedofundergraduatesAdamJones\n(Computing) and Justin Lee (Chemis-try), and PhD students Michael Mays\n(Aeronautics) and Enoch Yuen (Molec-ular Biosciences). Having swept through\nthe last three regular season tourna-ments, the four were touted by the UK\nQuizbowl organisation prior to the\ntournament as being on \u201cundoubtedly\nthe best form of any team in the country\u201d. Nonetheless, Oxford A, Cambridge\nA, and Edinburgh A were also heavy favourites to clinch the title this year, the\nlatter two having met in last year\u2019s final.\nThe tournament began with five preliminary rounds in brackets of six teams,\nfrom which teams would then be sorted\ninto upper, middle and lower brackets\nto give them a fairer competition in the\nafternoon. Imperial A breezed through\nthe morning with a clean sheet. Imperial\nB had a rougher start to the day, with a\n505-80 walloping by Edinburgh A. Narrow defeats to Cambridge B and Warwick B then led to them being placed in\nthe middle playoff bracket. Imperial C\nhad the misfortune of facing Oxford A,\nDurham A and Bristol A in their brack-et, and ended up in the lower playoff\nbracket.\nAll three Imperial teams fared well\nin the afternoon playoffs. Imperial A\nextended their winning streak to 40\ngames, before finally being bested by\nthe formidable Edinburgh A team in\nthe 11th round. Imperial B secured victory against all but Bristol A, squeezing\npast Sheffield A and Edinburgh B. After\ntheir rough start, Imperial C broke into\nthe top half of their playoff bracket \u2013 no\nmean feat, considering the difficulty of\nthe questions and that most of its players\nhad only started quizzing this year.\nAfter 11 rounds, Imperial A and OxfordAwerebothontopwitha10:1win-loss record; therefore, a one-game final\nwould determine the overall winner.\nImperial A scored the first starter ques-tion, but the game was closely fought;\nOxford led 115-75 after five questions.\nAt the halfway point, Imperial was back\nwith a narrow 25-point lead. Things\nturned south for Oxford after that; a few\nwell-intentioned but incorrect buzzes\ngaveawaythequestionstoImperial,who\nextended their lead. At the end, Imperial\nhad doubled Oxford\u2019s scoreline, and was\npresented with the trophy.\nWith Mays and Yuen finishing their\ndegrees this year, and most of this academic year\u2019s tournaments now behind\nus, BSQC 2023 is likely to be this ImperialAteam\u2019sswansong.However,with\nImperial\u2019s quizzing scene continuing\nto flourish, I very much doubt we\u2019ll be\nwaiting as long for the second title as we\ndid for the first.\nQuiz is coming home\nOscar O'Flanagan\nQuiz Treasurer\nImperial triumph at national tournament.\nThe Imperial A team with the BSQC trophy.

    "content": "Marvel has been letting down even its biggest fans\nsince Infinity War at the end of Phase Three - barring one or two decent movies - and unfortunately their\nrecent Quantumania release appears to have followed\nthat trend. I went in with low expectations, not being\nenamoured with the previous two Ant-Man films, but\nleft with those expectations torn to shreds. The 2 hours\nand 5 minutes spent in the quantum realm could just as\neasily have been 25 minutes for all that the film actually\npresented.\nI very much want to give them the benefit of the\ndoubt, so to start with a good thing; the A-lister cast\nmade a decent effort to retain the comedy factor despite the stiffness of the scripted jokes. It didn\u2019t feel like\nthere\u2019s as much ad-libbing going on, despite the off-script work in the earlier films being some of their best\nmoments. Scott Lang\u2019s (Paul Rudd) comedic \u2018walk down\nthe street with voiceover\u2019 at the beginning and end of\nthe movie was amusing, albeit slightly misplaced and\nproviding little value other than making the events of\nthe film seem like they were all in a day\u2019s work.\nThe core problem with Marvel\u2019s current formula is\nthat they try to do way too much, when simpler concepts and plotlines would suffice, allowing them more\ntime to flesh out their characters and the film\u2019s world.\nThere is a sore lack of meaningful, non-cliched interaction between the cast members, which is likely down to\nshoddy scriptwriting, but could also be the sheer number of new \u2018main\u2019 characters introduced in each new\ninstallation.\nOne of these characters is Kang the Conqueror;\nthere were high hopes for Jonathon Major\u2019s portrayal\nof the comic-book menace. However, to me, he also fell\nshort of convincing. Kang has an all-too-familiar stance\non universe domination, not unlike Thanos\u2019. Kang\u2019s empire also bears an uncanny resemblance to the First Order in Star Wars Episode 7, but surely a galactic empire\nshouldn\u2019t be visually comparable to a quantum-scale\none?\nAs far as other characters go, we\u2019re introduced to a\ntribal war leader, a human-but-not-human telepath, a\nlightbulb-headed android, and a jelly-snail hybrid creature who\u2019s fascinated by other creatures\u2019 holes. Don\u2019t\neven get me started on M.O.D.O.K. (Mental Organism\nDesigned Only For Killing) - the giant floating head of Dr\nDarren Cross, Ant-Man 1\u2019s nemesis.

The whole film\nis spent inside the \u2018quantum realm\u2019 and, as a result, it\nsort of loses the sense of drama and world-ending terror that every other MCU film leans on.

Martial Arts\nhas enough societies to form its own\ncategory, as there are 8 different martial\nart types available at Imperial.\nThe Charitable societies focus on one\nissue each, and it\u2019s fascinating to see how\nstudents are giving back by raising funds\nfor refugees (STAR), North Korean escapees (Liberty in North Korea), rural\nareas which lack education (RED), and\nactively participate in things like feeding\nthe homeless community.\nThere are currently 403 societies, but\nif you feel like there could be a 404th,\nthen please do apply through the Union\nbefore the 12th of March or 21st of May\ndeadlines to get started!\nCharlotte Probstel Societies Editor\nHow well are Imperial\u2019s societies spread out?\n12 Categories\n\u2022 academic\n\u2022 Arts and\nEntertainment\n\u2022 Charitable\n\u2022 Cultural\n\u2022 Department\n\u2022 Faith\n\u2022 Indoor\n\u2022 Martial Arts\n\u2022 Media\n\u2022 Outdoor\n\u2022 Social\n\u2022 Sports\n6Baking, Brewing, International\nFoodies Society, Alternative\nProtein, VegSoc, Tea\nFood\nSocieties\n7\nArgentine Tango, Dance - Funkology,\nDance (ICSM), Dance Club, Dance\nCompany, Hip Hop Society, K Pop\nSociety\nDance\nSocieties\n6Tabletop Gaming, Poker,\nMahjong, Bridge, Chess,\nGaming & E-Sports\nGames\nSocieties\n403\nTotal Societies at Imperial\n10\nMartial Arts\nSocieties\nJiu Jitsu, Judo, Ju-Jitsu (Aiuchi),\nKarate, Kendo, Krav, Kung Fu, Muay\nThai, Shaolin Kung Fu, Shorinji\nKempo, Taekwondo, Wing Chun,\nWushu\n11 Climate Entrepreneurs,\nConsultancy, Entrepreneurs,\nFinance, Investment, Law,\nManagement, Speakers,\nDoctorpreneurs, Women in\nBusiness, Venture Capital &\nPrivate Equity\nEntrepreneurial\nSocieties\nFRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\n61\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSOCIETIES\n\n"

Felix understands\nthat this is mostly funded by partners\nand sponsors of Street Art for Mankind.\nBlackett Laboratory \u2013 one of three\nbuildings in the UK to have been\ndesignatedahistoricsitebytheEuropean\nPhysical Society \u2013 would be the canvas\nfor the London installation of this\ninitiative. In the Planning Statement,\nDirector of Estates Operations for the\nCollege Nick Roalfe explains\n\u201cGiven Imperial College\u2019s strong\ncommitment to sustainability, the\nopportunity to provide an elevation\non one of the campus buildings to\nallow a mural supported by UNEP\nand promoting sustainability is an\nopportunity that the College wish to\npursue.\u201d\nStaff and students alike have\nadditional qualms about the subject and\nmerit of the proposed artwork, which\nwould emblazon the building in rain-resistant weatherproof paint until at\nleast 2028.\nThe design, by Spanish artist Vesod,\nwas justified by Imperial in the planning\napplication:\n\u201cThe painting is dedicated to mother\nnature with the aim of calling the viewer\nto focus on the relationship between\nmankind and nature. Using images of\nLondon parks, the artist works on the\ncircularity of the space to recall the\nnatural cycle. The continuous renewal of\nnature blends with the elements of the\ncity with the idea that they can renew\nthemselves together.\u201d\nHowever, comments call the \u201cvoid\nand uninspiring piece\u201d \u201chollow\u201d,\n\u201cmeaningless\u201d, \u201cgarish\u201d, \u201ctasteless\u201d,\n\u201cderivative\u201d and \u201ctone-deaf\u201d.\nFurthermore, some feel the subject\nis not aligned with the diversity and\ninclusion Imperial intends to foster, as\none member of staff argued\n\u201cThe outdated and somewhat\nsexualised representation of mother\nnature as a white woman is particularly\ninappropriate, not just from a diversity\nand inclusivity standpoint, but also\nbecause it reinforces a stereotype that\nconfines women to purely mothering\nroles. For a university that purports to\nhave a strong equality, diversity, and\ninclusion strategy, this appears to be a\ncompletely tone-deaf application and\nshould not be approved.\u201d\nIt is not just the Imperial community\nwho have doubts; Knightsbridge\nCommittee have commented\n\u201cWhereas we are not opposed in\nprinciple to the proposed mural, our\ncommittee feels there is not enough\ndetail re design and colouration in the\ndocuments, and have asked Imperial\nfor further details before making a final\ncomment.\u201d\nThe application is pending.\nAn Imperial College London\nspokesperson said: \u201cWe are pleased\nthat Imperial has been approached by\nthe UN Environmental Programme\nand renowned artist group Street Art\nfor Mankind to be the location for one\nof their prestigious global Ecosystem\nRestoration Murals. The mural,\ncurrently designated for the Queens\nGate wall of the Blackett building, aims\nto raise awareness and mobilise action to\nrestoreecosystemsandwillbeapowerful\nsymbol of Imperial\u2019s commitment to\nglobal sustainability efforts.\u201d\nContinued from page 1...\nMural mayhem\nOn International Women\u2019s Day\n(Wednesday 8th March 2023) Felix\nattended a panel discussion held in the\nBusiness School. The event, \u2018Women in\nSTEM: Women in Conservation\u2019 was\norganised and hosted by PhD students\nfrom Imperial\u2019s Grantham Institute for\nClimate Change in association with the\nNatural Environment Research Council\n(a branch of UKRI).\nThe panel began with a video\nintroduction from conservationist Jane\nGoodall. In the video, she detailed\nhow she came to be involved in wildlife\nconservation, the journey she went on,\nand gave the audience - and particularly\nthe women - some advice on doing what\nyou\u2019re passionate about, even in the face\nof adversity.\nChairing the discussion was\necosystems ecologist Dr Waring, who\nhas studied the uptake of carbon by\nthe land and ecosystems and their\npotential for climate mitigation. Also\non the panel were Professor Heather\nKoldewey, who works in marine biology\nto solve conservation problems such\nas protecting marine areas and plastic\npollution in the ocean, and Dr Caroline\nHowe, who works in environmental\nsocial science and policy. Howe seeks to\nexplore the relationship between people\nand nature, as well as equity and justice\nissues surrounding usage and access to\nnatural resources.\nPatricia Zurita, CEO of Birdlife\nInternational and the first woman from\na developing country to run a major\ninternational conservation organisation,\nunfortunately couldn\u2019t attend the\nevent in person due to a last-minute\nemergency. However, she still managed\nto offer insights by joining online at the\nend.\nAmong the topics discussed were\nhow to ensure women can achieve their\nhighestpotentialinprofessionalsettings,\nand how to best balance scientific work\nand research with familial and childcare\nresponsibilities. Work-life conflicts seem\nespecially prevalent in conservation\ncareers, where travelling for fieldwork\nand conferences is often necessary. The\nadvice the panelists shared was not only\nfor women themselves, but also for\ntheir male peers, mentors, partners, and\nmanagers to note.\nThe event was concluded with a quick\nQ&A session. The discussion centred\naround where there are still gaps in\nsupport for women and mothers and\non the stereotypes that prevail within\nthe industry; yet there was a was a\nresounding sense of hope among the\nspeakers that (in Zurita\u2019s words) \u201cthere\u2019s\na bright future ahead.\u201d She explained\n\u201c[women are starting] to gain more\nrespect for the extraordinary input we\nbring to the table\u201d.\nWomen at Imperial Week wraps\nup on Friday 10th March (today if you\nare an eager reader of Felix) with two\nmore events: an online interview with\none of the Provost\u2019s Visting Professors,\nProfessor Priscilla Reddy from 12:30-13:30, and a \u2018Women at Imperial\u2019 party\nat 17:00 in the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms at\nSouth Kensington.\nCheck felixonline.co.uk next week\nfor more photos and insights from the\nevent.\nCredit: Rolando Charles\nThe Imperial Business School lecture theatre where the event was taking place.\nWomen working in conservation\nZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\n\n"

    "content": "Organisations are increasingly being scrutinised\nby civil society and social media, as well as by\nfunders and regulators. They are now recognising the requirement to be transparent and\naccountable for their behaviours to an array of\nstakeholders, as Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) climbs up the agenda.\nMy definition of ESG is \u2018the governance of pur-pose-driven organisations with the intention of\nfulfilling their social responsibilities in an ethical\nand sustainable manner\u2019. I believe we, as pro-fessionals, should be taking seriously our responsibilities for handling the numerous global\ncrises the world is facing. This includes health,\nbiodiversity and climate crises as well as pollution of rivers, oceans and land. We saw how professionals working in science, technology and\nmedicine took their social responsibilities seriously during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 notably\nprofessionals working at Imperial College. This\nneeds to continue in all walks of life.\nMy own journey into ESG started at Imperial College. As part of my first degree at the Department\nof Civil Engineering \u2013 before the department was\nrenamed to include the words \u2018and Environmental\u2019 \u2013 we studied a course about Engineering and\nthe Environment. This course gave me the understanding that I had a role beyond designing\nstructures according to the client\u2019s requirements\nand engineering regulations and codes of prac-tice. I realised that I also have a wider responsibility to society to protect the environment. This\nunderstanding has been an underlying principle\nas I moved into management and governance\nroles at national and international level.\nI believe you too have a role in ESG in whichever field you are specialising in. You need to\nunderstand the changing nature of the wider\ncontext, and consider these changes in terms\nof decisions you make \u2013 in your personal life,\nthe organisations you choose to work for, and\nin your professional capacity. One consideration may be \u2018do I want to work for a truly pur-pose-driven organisation or am I happy to work\nin a profit-driven organisation?\u2019 I have worked\nfor both types and made my choice to focus on\npurpose-driven organisations.\nIf you choose to work for an organisation focused on profits \u2013 and there are many sensible\nreasons to do so \u2013 you can be part of the change\ntowards a greater purpose. I\u2019ll leave you to make\nyour own choices, but all I ask is that you reflect\non why the UN decided to develop the Sustainable Development Goals. You could work for an\norganisation that prioritises short-term profit for\nthe few, or you could work for an organisation\nthat tackles one or more of these goals with\npositive impacts after your time in the workforce\nends \u2013the choice is yours.\nConsider ESG in your career choices:\nthoughts from an Imperial alumnus\nAnita Punwani (Civil Engineering \u201888, MBA \u201891)\nPresenters at the London Sustainability Conference poster exhibtion holding Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal signs, credit: Sustainable Imperial\nvii\n\n"

We\u2019ll\nbe right back!\nBEST PICTURE\nALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT\nNinety-threeyearsaftertheoriginal,thisgrimFirst\nWorld War epic has become a surprising favourite\nfor Best Picture \u2013 the first German-language film to\never be nominated for the category. Releasing briefly in cinemas before moving home to Netflix (who\nproduced it), All Quiet has already won the best\nfilm award at the BAFTAs. The Academy is usually\nfamous for relegating non-English films to nominations only in the international category (a trend notably bucked by Bong Joon Ho\u2019s Parasite in 2020), so a\nwin here would be an interesting turn of events, and a\nclear harbinger of rises in the acceptance of subtitles\nby us audiences in the uncultured Anglosphere.\nAVATAR: THE WAY OF WATER\nIn 2010, Avatar won three of the nine categories it\nwas nominated for at the 82nd Academy Awards \u2013\nBest Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best\nVisual Effects \u2013 although it narrowly missed out on\nthe prestigious Best Picture win. This year the seismic\nsequel, 13 years in the making, tries again. Undoubtedly a strong contender for Visual Effects once again,\nTWOW\u2019s nomination for Best Picture has divided\ncritics \u2013 but in an age of cinemas struggling to stay\nafloat, you have to give the film some credit for supporting the industry in a way that the other nominations (aside from Top Gun) really couldn\u2019t.\nTHE BANSHEES OF INISHERIN\nWith a slightly more understated premise than the\notherfilmsinthiscategory,TheBansheesofInisherin\nis relying on its dark comedy, Irish charm and talent-edcasttopushitoverthefinishline.Nominatedfor9\ncategories \u2013 a record for an Irish film \u2013 Banshees has\ngood chances in the categories of Best Screenplay and\nBest Supporting Actor, but it remains to be seen how\nit will fare against some of the more crowd-pleasing\noffers for Best Picture. See Film Writer Ioana E\u015fanu\u2019s\narticle in issue 1812 for a comprehensive review!\nELVIS\nAustin Butler\u2019s Elvis Presley is a strong\nfavourite for Best Actor this year, in Baz\nLuhrmann\u2019s dreamlike biopic of the King\nof Rock n\u2019 Roll. However, whether Elvis\nwill match that by winning Best Picture\nis anyone\u2019s guess. Whilst biopics have become the darling of the Academy when it\ncomes to choosing the lead actors, the best\npictures haven\u2019t followed the same pat-tern. Then again, Elvis is about as realistic\na biopic as it is boring (not very), so maybe\nthat will help its chances.\nEVERYTHING EVERYWHERE\nALL AT ONCE\nThe current favourite, and by far the\nmost out-there film of the bunch \u2013 which\nis a surprising combination if you look at\nthe history of Best Picture winners. Nevertheless, this hyper-dimensional rollercoaster of a film is on a strong course according to the experts. It\u2019s standing tall\nwith the most nominations of any film\nthis year, and despite the crazy narrative\nthere\u2019s still an element of family drama\nat its heart. Then again, it\u2019s a bit weird \u2013\nmaybe all of the skeletons in the Academy\nwill be turned off by that, and scurry back\nto hide behind Spielberg\u2019s legs.\n\n"

They look\nat all the proposals that deal with marine\nspecies and give their scientific opinion.\nThe parties then take information that\ncomes from FAO, and then take the\ndecision whether something is going to\nbe listed.\nWe have partnerships with the United\nNations Environment Program. We\nwork a lot on livelihoods, indigenous\npeople, who are really in the front\nlines because they live right next to the\nhabitats of these animals and plants. We\nhave to work with these communities to\nmake sure that they have an incentive to\ntake care of those habitats, that there\u2019s\nno poaching of the animals, cutting\ndown of trees. I\u2019m the chair now of\nthe Collaborative Partnership on\nSustainable Management of Wildlife\n\u2026 14 organisations with whom we\npartner, and all of them have something\nto do with wildlife management. It\u2019s\ntrying to find ways in which\nusing wildlife is sustainable,\nbecause for fishing\ncommunities and many who\nlive next to animals, they are\ndependent on them for their\nfood. Even wild meat (what\nused to be called bushmeat),\nif done sustainably for those\ncommunities - we have to\nbe able to work with them\nto avoid disease, but also to\navoid the overexploitation of\nthese species. If you have it at\nthe source and you\u2019re using\nit as your protein, there\u2019s\nusually no overexploitation.\nBut once it starts becoming\na luxury item, people from\noutside come to take those\nspecies - that\u2019s when the\nproblems start. So yes,\npartnerships are absolutely\nessential.\nMarie: How are you\nplanning to celebrate World\nWildlife Day?\nIvonne: We\u2019re very proud\nto say that we are going\nback to where the treaty was\nsigned, Washington, D.C.,\nand we\u2019re going to have the\ncelebration with the United\nStates government. We will\nhave the secretary of the\ninterior, Miss Deb Haaland,\nwho is going to be speaking\nat the opening. She\u2019s an\nindigenous person, so I\u2019m\nvery proud that I\u2019m going\nto get to meet her. We\u2019re [also going\nto have speakers] from Switzerland,\nbecause when you create a treaty there\u2019s\na depository government that keeps the\ntreaty \u2014 Switzerland is a depository\ngovernment for the CITES treaty. But\nthe most important thing is that we\u2019re\ngoing to have those who have engaged\nin partnerships tell us how [those\npartnerships] have been successful.\nWe\u2019re going to have somebody from\nthe Caribbean, who\u2019s going to speak\nabout Queen Conch \u2013 a marine species\nvery popular within the Caribbean and\n[among] people from the Caribbean\nliving outside the Caribbean. It was very\nmuch endangered \u2026 overexploited, and\nalmost disappearing. So working with\nthis organisation of eastern Caribbean\nstates, the fishers, the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development\n\u2013 slowly, things are getting better.\nThey\u2019re putting in legislation that they\ndidn\u2019t have before about wildlife. That\npartnership has helped improve the\nsituation,sothey\u2019regoingtobespeaking.\nThen we\u2019ll have a panel speaking\nabout the issue of financing. The private\nsector hasn\u2019t been that notorious in\nterms of contributing to conservation,\nexcept as charity, [because] how can you\nget something back when you invest in\nwildlife? There\u2019s a new bond \u2013 originally\ncalled the Rhino Bond, but it\u2019s now\nabout wildlife in general \u2013 to guarantee\nthat if things go well in terms of the\npopulation of the species increasing, the\ninvestor will get some profits. Climate\nchange gets a lot of investment - much\nmore than biodiversity - so how can we\nuse that to convince them to invest in\nbiodiversity? This is another discussion\nthat we\u2019re going to have to have that day.\nWe have representatives from\nSingapore and Malaysia coming to\nspeak about the work that they have\nbeen doing to engage youth in the cause\nof CITES and conservation. CITES\nis now developing a youth network -we want to be able to bring youth on\nboard because all this work that we\u2019re\ndoing is for the youth. Alongside that,\nwe have things that normally happen on\nWildlife Day. One is the Jackson Wild\nFilm Showcase, [where] there\u2019s prizes\ngiven to the best films talking about\nwildlife conservation. And there\u2019s the\nInternational Fund for Animal Welfare\npainting contest, and there\u2019s a painting\nselected for a prize also talking about\nwildlife conservation. It\u2019s going to be\nquite a packed day, but very interesting.\nMarie: Are you optimistic about\nthe future of wildlife conservation?\nAnd how can students get involved in\ncontributing to this?\nIvonne: We have to remain optimistic\n- we hear a lot of bad news every day.\nYouth have the biggest worries, and\nyou\u2019re saying \u2018what are these people\ndoing to our planet?\u2019 Not only are we\nin difficult times when we talk about\nthe triple planetary crisis - pollution,\nclimate change, the biodiversity crisis\n- we\u2019re also in a difficult geo-political\nsituation with the war going on right\nnow. It\u2019s hard to remain optimistic when\nthese things are happening, but we must\nremain optimistic. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s\ngood to hear these stories about how\npartnerships have helped. I can tell you\na number of things that have been done\nunder CITES with populations who\nwere on the brink - vicu\u00f1a, crocodiles,\nsnowdrop. Getting communities\ninvolved,workingwiththegovernments,\nincludinglegislation\u2026allofthesethings\nhave made a difference and brought\nsome species back. It\u2019s also changing\nhuman habits. We don\u2019t need illegal\nproducts - we have to learn to reduce\nthe demand for illegal products, and\nstudents can help us with that. Spread\nthe word - pangolin scales are not going\nto cure any diseases, rhino horn is not\ngoing to cure any diseases. It\u2019s the same\nas a fingernail. I remain optimistic for\nthe future because I know the youth is\nactive. You have to put pressure on us.\nYou have to say what kind of future you\nwould like to have and communicate\nthat loudly. Make sure that you\u2019re heard\nwhen decisions are being taken in your\ncountries. With development, [like]\nbuilding new highways, we have to be\ncareful that it\u2019s not going to have an\nimpact on wildlife.\nRight now, it\u2019s a very polarised\nenvironment of those who are against\nany type of wildlife trade, and those who\nhave a different approach to wildlife\ntrade. Emotions can run high, but it\u2019s\ndifferent for a person who\u2019s sitting in an\napartmentonFifthAvenueinManhattan\nthan a person who\u2019s sitting next to the\nAmazon River who has to think about\nhow they\u2019re going to put food on their\nplate every single day. That\u2019s why you\nhave to have empathy - taking tough\ndecisions, but finding ways in which\nthose tough decisions that have to be\ntaken can be ameliorated and softened\nby giving alternative livelihoods. If you\nhave to take it from the wild, let it be for\nthe people that live there, or at least have\na fair compensation.\nCredit: Natalie Yu\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\n11\nENVIRONMENT\n\n"

Oddly, it\u2019s not one of the industry\u2019s top picks\nfor Best Picture, despite picking up a good number of prestigious awards in the season so far. As\nwe mentioned previously biopics usually tend\nto do well in the Best Actor/Actress categories,\nbut don\u2019t dominate as much in the main event.\nSome critics love it, others don\u2019t \u2013 and in a category with a preference-based ballot, that can kill\na film\u2019s chances.\nTRIANGLE OF SADNESS\nIt would be a bittersweet irony, to see the\naudience give one of their classic standing ovations for this comedy that satirises the gross\nexcesses in the lifestyles of the super-rich. Despite securing the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes last\nyear (the second win for director Ruben \u00d6stlund), the film doesn\u2019t seem the most likely\ncandidate for the win \u2013 the Palme d\u2019Or not\nusually being a great predictor of Academy\nchoices (the recent exception, again, being\nParasite). Again, for a full review, see Sorcha\nOwens\u2019 work in issue 1820.\nTHE FABELMANS\nSpielberg, the most successful director of all\ntime and nominated twelve times for the catego-ry, has only ever won Best Picture once; Schindler\u2019sListin1994.Famouslysnubbedin1999for\nSaving Private Ryan, perhaps this year Spielberg\nwill get his wish one more time. It wouldn\u00b4t be\nunexpected \u2013 an introspective look at the early\nyears of the beloved industry titan, all the while\ncharting a love letter to cinema. This sort of personalfilmhasagoodhistoryattheOscars\u2013think\nRoma, Moonlight. Spielberg is also a master of\nwell-paced storytelling for the masses \u2013 a crowd\npleaser, where other entries such as Everything\nWOMEN TALKING\nSarah Polley\u2019s ensemble drama is poignantly real. Thematically based on the horrors\nexperienced by a Bolivian community in the\nmid-2000s, Women Talking sees eight women from a religious colony discussing what to\ndo in the midst of a culture of patriarchal sexual abuse. Almost the entire film takes place\nin a single room, supported entirely by the\nstrength of its excellent cast. Unfortunately,\nthe general consensus seems to find it unlikely\nthat Women Talking will take the win, given\nits highly focused scope and challenging (for\nthe Academy) material.\n... and we\u2019re back!\nHere\u2019s more about\nThe Oscars and\nFelix predictions\nTOP GUN: MAVERICK\nAlong with Avatar, this is the only other\nentry that can claim to have saved cinema \u2013 a\nvenue that has historically been favoured by\nthe Academy over streaming - and it\u2019s a certainly not a false claim. If the Best Picture\nwinner was chosen by the number of people\nwho enjoyed the film worldwide, Top Gun\nwould have a pretty clear shot. Unfortunately\nfor Tom, the chances aren\u2019t high as it is. \u2018Mainstream\u2019 blockbusters have usually had trouble\nwinning post-90s, and sequels even more.\nBEST PICTURE\n\n"

The College has clearly\nrecognised this and has concluded that the mental health of the\nBlackett Building itself is of paramount importance, a decision\nstemming from the College\u2019s own new policy of \u2018trickle-down mental\nhealth\u2019. One spokesperson for the College, Dr Mac Iavellian, told\nCatnip \u201cwe hope improving the mental wellbeing of the building\nitself will lead to a permeating sense of \u2018good vibes\u2019 throughout\nthe department\u201d.\nThe College\u2019s plan for animating the once inanimate is the\ncommissioning of a new mural to adorn the blank grey-space located\non the side of the building. The mural will cover the entire wall and\nis directly inspired by London\u2019s green spaces which are known for\ntheir outstanding beauty and contemplative spirit. The art depicts\nMother Nature holding a glowing flower and surrounded by various\nflora and fauna in the foreground, and the city of London wrapped\nup in a Christopher-Nolan-Inception-esque taurus \u2013 a sight one\ncommonly sees in the Royal Parks on a Wednesday afternoon.\nThe artist Imperial commissioned this masterpiece from is the\nItalian artist Vesod, who, for the purpose of this article, wished to\nremain mononymous. Regarding Vesod, the College said, \u201c[Vesod]\ngraduated in maths, a subject that has had an important influence\non his works, along with renaissance art and futurism. This can be\nrecognised in Vesod\u2019s attempt to harmonise anatomic proportion\nand futuristic dynamics.\u201d One can also clearly see Vesod\u2019s artistic\nrange on his website with such wall works as \u2018Woman with her\nhair in a bun looking away\u2019, \u2018Woman with her hair in a bun looking\nup\u2019, \u2018Woman with her hair in a bun looking both left and right\u2019,\n\u2018Woman with her hair in a bun whispering to woman with her hair\nin a bun\u2019, and\u2018Woman with a hair bun\u2019.\nOne can clearly see how such detailed expressions of pagan\nthemes and metropolitan contortions is an attempt to give the\nbuilding, and thus the Department and students as a whole, the\nreinvigoration it needs. It is evident that the artwork will bestow\na sense of wellbeing and tranquillity upon the department and for\nanyone who happens to pass by and glimpse this artistic marvel;\na stark contrast in character to Imperial\u2019s most recent, and well-endowed art installation, \u2018ALERT\u2019 by Anthony Gormley, which\nreflects on students\u2019attentiveness.\nNot only will the artwork create a miasma of mental wellbeing\nin the Physics Department, the College also hopes that by depicting\nscenes that have nothing to do with physics, the students will\nforget what it is they actually study there and thus won\u2019t be\nable to remember what to complain about in the next student\nsurvey, thereby increasing the department\u2019s national ranking. Dr\nKaf Kaesque, a representative for the Department of Physics, has\nstated \u201cin the Physics Department we often like to kill multiple\nbirds with a single stone; this new mural is just that. We aim to not\nonly improve the mental health of our building, but also restore\nour prestige\u201d. The relevant forms for this installation have been\nsubmitted and approval is currently pending.\nReaders can see the full plan on City of Westminster planning\nand licensing page: Ref No: 23/00480/FULL.\nDISCLAIMER: THIS IS A JOKE; THE MURAL IS NOT\nCATNIP\nKEEP THE CAT FREE FROM THE TYRANNY OF CATNIP ADDICTION\n48 felixonline.co.uk\nThis Week\u2019s Comic:\nWant to write for\nCatnip?

    "content": "Earlier this year, Davos 23 gathered\nin Switzerland and reiterated the\nneed to have a unified, global approach\nto tackling climate change. However,\nthis global unity lasted merely a week\nbefore the US attempted to coax green\ncompanies from Europe onto their soil\nto boost their economy. Even though\ncountries need to work together to\ntackle climate change together, the economic climate was considered more\nimportant than the environmental one.\nRishi Sunak also recommitted to\nthe \u00a311.6 billion international climate\nfund but has not reassured the nation\nthat the timescale will be the same.\nIs this a subtle attempt of cutting the\nbudget due to the looming recession?\nBalancing cost cutting\nwith environmental\nresponsibility\nOn a more individual level,\n50% of the UK population has cut\ncosts since September, but at what\nenvironmental price? Cheaper food\nitems usually coincide with a higher\ncarbon footprint. Rising fuel costs\ntend to make unsustainable methods\nof producing it more attractive.\nThe issue of climate change is\nstill important to many in Britain\nand the world, but the cost-of-living crisis has changed priorities.\nWe narrow down our options based\non cost, not sustainability. But we can\nstill use this to our advantage. We can\nsee that some choices we have made as a\nresultofthecost-of-livingcrisishavealso\nhelped the environment, such as using\na bicycle rather than a car, or storing\nleftovers rather than wasting them.\nThe cost-of-living crisis provides a\nunique opportunity for a new storyline.\nEmbracing \u2018it\u2019s cheap being\ngreen\u2019\nIt is cheap being green. Take the\nmotto reuse, reduce, recycle. Reusable\ncoffee cups often result in a discount in\nyour morning coffee and decreases the\namount of single-use coffee cups used\n(you can save 50p per coffee at Pret!).\nReducing food waste can provide\nyou with lunches and potentially saves\nUK households up to \u00a3700 a year.\nFinally, recycling cuts down on\nmanufacturing and production costs,\nand refurbished items are cheap and\nreduce the waste of natural resources.\nThe 'it is cheap being green' narrative\nhas been tried in the past but the current\ncrisis has given it a new voice that people\nmight sincerely listen to. We want\ncheap, and we want a good conscience.\nThis narrative can provide both.\nBut is this narrative accurate, or\nis it a statement made up to make us\nfeel better? It\u2019s true that green living\ndoes require sacrifice whichever\nway it is spun, including input from\nthe government and businesses.\nBut even without any reforms, we\nare currently seeing sustainable choices\nbeing chosen for cost, and all we need\nto do is flip the mindset around to\nshow how cheap choices can help the\nenvironment. Pick Vinted over Primark,\neat veggie meals a few times a week, and\nstore your leftovers for lunch rather\nthan throwing them away. Instead of\nseeing green living as a burden on our\ntightened budgets, we need to see it\nas an aid. And as we make more green\nchoices on an individual level, we will\nencourage governments and businesses\nto join in on sustainable choices as\nthey aim to meet consumer interests.\nLet\u2019s turn an apparent conflict into the\ndriving force to reach net zero by 2050.\nAllanah Hibbert Science Writer\nEdited by: angie lo\ntaylor pomfret\nScience&Technology\nCan greener be cheaper?\nExploring the narrative of \u2018it\u2019s cheap being green\u2019 is Science writer Allanah Hibbert, who outlines\nhow the cost-of-living crisis can inspire us all to make sustainable choices for a better future.\nLow-cost bicycle parking garage \u2018Stationsplein\u2019, under Amsterdam Central Station.

Bringing\nyou a plethora of six films in one night, which\nwere fabulously curated by the Cinema crew (ahem...\nyours truly), we proudly present to you Imperial\u2019s best\ncinema experience of the year!\nWe know that at this time of the year, Imperial is re-lentless, and you\u2019re likely burrowing yourself in course-work, projects, or preparing for exams. However, we all\nneed breaks, and with a work-filled day, why not end it\nwith a fun-filled night?\nHear this out. Imagine watching 6 great films on a\n33ftsilverscreen,projectedusinga35mmKinotoncin-ema projector, with Dolby Digital EX surround sound\nbooming as you laugh, cheer, and cry. All at a fraction\nof the price at other cinemas, and right at your door-step. Imperial Cinema aims to continue a decades-old\ntradition of all-nighters, bringing you a fundamental\nImperial experience that many former students have\nenjoyed. This is it; this is the Spring All-Nighter 2023.\nThere are lots to celebrate with the all-nighter, especially the end of term. There is however one aspect\nwhich I would love to highlight, which are the films!\nComing in just two days after Oscars Night, the Spring\nAll-Nighter showcases Marvel\u2019s latest offering together with five Oscar-nominated films. Personally, having\nseenacoupleofthesefilms(androotingforthematthe\nOscars), I can say with certainty that these films will\nbreak your heart, uplift your spirits, and take you on a\njourney like no other. On that note, I\u2019ll leave each film\nwith their best quotes, no-context of course.\nJonathan Yap CinemaSoc Vice Chair (Events)\nFRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 53\nFILM & TV\nThe Spring All-Nighter is back!\n18:00 - Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\nThis is the blockbuster pick of our line-up. The third entry in the Ant-Man and the\nWasp series brings our protagonists and family to the quantum realm, where they\nwould face off against Marvel\u2019s greatest villain in the Multiverse saga: Kang the\nConqueror. Having seen it, Jonathan Majors absolutely stuns in the role of Kang.\nThere are also two post-credit scenes which you won\u2019t miss this time \u2018cause you\u2019ll be\nstaying for the full all-nighter right? Right?\n20:40 - T\u00e1r\nThis is the arthouse pick in the line-up, telling the story of an EGOT\nconductor-composer at the peak of her career, as she navigates through\nchallenges in her relationships and ultimately, herself. Silently meditating with its character study, yet roaring in its orchestral composition,\nCate Blanchett dissolves into Lydia T\u00e1r in this film about power, mental\nhealth, and the cancel culture. Selected as the best film of 2022 by all\nfour of the world\u2019s top critics associations: LA, NY, London, and the\nNational Society of Critics, it joins only 3 other films with this honour.\nFind out if T\u00c1R is really what they make it out to be.\n23:50 - The Fabelmans\nThis is the awards pick of our line-up. You can\u2019t go wrong with Steven Spielberg.\nHaving proved time and time again that he\u2019s one of the most versatile filmmakers\nin the business, directing films from the likes of Jurassic Park and E.T., to Ready\nPlayer One and last year\u2019s West Side Story, Spielberg is back again with a heavy\nhitter of a film. Spielberg\u2019s most personal film yet is an autobiographical look at his\nfamily during the 50s and 60s, where individuals conflict between family, love, and\nambition. Spielberg reportedly shed tears throughout filming, overwhelmed with\nthe playing-out of memory into reality.\n02:40 - Puss in Boots: The Last Wish\nOk that\u2019s a fake quote. This is the fan favourite pick in the line-up. I\u2019ve had a number of people come up to me asking if Imperial Cinema would be showing the\nfilm. And with the full-body poster in the UCH reception being ever-popular, we\ncouldn\u2019t say no to screening this hyper-stylised animated masterpiece of a film. Join\nPuss as he faces his mortality after using up 8 of his 9 lives, while being chased by\na mysterious villain. So this shows the power of your suggestions; keep giving us\nrecommendations and you\u2019ll likely see it in our next line-up.\n\u201cIt\u2019spussin\u2019time\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019llbeoursecretmovie,justyoursandmine.\u201d\n04:45 - Women Talking\nWomen Talking is the staff pick of the line-up. So don\u2019t be surprised if\nyou see us disappear from the ticket counter, as we are likely chilling at\nthe front row of the cinema watching the magnetic performance of an\nensemble pour their hearts out as they make a choice between staying,\nfighting, and leaving, in a colony where women are grappling with\na brutal reality of assault. Inspired by true events, the film has been\ndescribed as raw yet rich, and deeply resonant. Ok we\u2019re probably not\nchilling, more like gripping our seats in tension.\n\u201cIwanttotalkaboutmyhorses,RuthandCheryl\u201d\n06:50 - Marcel the Shell with Shoes On\nThis is the independent film pick in the line-up. Well, we couldn\u2019t say no to those\nlittle eyes. Puss has competition. The film tells the story of Marcel the Shell as he\nsearches for his family, while becoming an internet sensation in the process. He also\nlives with his grandma, it\u2019s SO adorable. There\u2019s no better film to end the all-nighter\nwith, so make sure to stay for this one.

    "content": "FRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\n15\nARTS\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nWhen we think of the Renaissance we\nconjure up images of stoic philosophers pacing through marble halls debating and conversing, or\ndepictions of Madonnas and various Saints with\nexpressions of wistfulness or determination. In our\nminds these images are skilfully detailed and expertly\ncrafted with attention to anatomical detail and pro-portion. When we think of Donatello, we are tempted\nto side-line him amongst the other great Renaissance\nartists as just another master of craft. However, the Donatello exhibit provided by the V&A Museum takes us\non a deep-dive into the works of this sculpting genius\nand shows us how Donatello \u2013 along with masters like\nMichelangelo and Da Vinci \u2013 deserves more attention.\nConsidered one of Donatello\u2019s greatest works is the\nblack bronze sculpture of David. The subject is wearing nothing but boots and a cap and his expression is\nadored with swagger and child-like mirth; the sculpture conveys both a sense of triumph over tyranny but\nalso of sexual desire. The bronze David however is not\nwhat we see in this exhibit. Instead we are greeted by a\nmuch larger David, carved from marble, fully clothed,\nand standing proud on the head of his adversary, Goliath. A huge contrast in character, this sculpture shows\nDavid as a proud and powerful individual; his expression is that of conquering hero. We are thus shown\nfrom the start that Donatello is a master of not only\nsculpture, but of human character and expression.\nHis skill at capturing human emotion are continually displayed in the exhibit. Throughout we are shown\nnumerous examples of Virgin and Child depictions\nhowever each depiction is unique in its expression, its\nartistic technique, and its material. Seated Virgin and\nChild is made from terrcotta and depicts the Virgin\nMary with a melancholic gaze and the Christ Child\nclinging to his mother for affection and protection.\nIt is evident to see how Donatello captures both the\nscriptural foreshadowing of Christ\u2019s death, indicated\nby Mary\u2019s saddened expression and also the very visceral image of the interaction between a helpless child and\nits mother. The child clasping to his mother for safety\ncombinedwithourownknowledgeofChrist\u2019seventual\ndeath makes this depiction an emotional rollercoaster.\nThe grace and tranquillity exuded by this piece comes\nfromDonatello\u2019sdepictionofGothicforms\u2013taughtto\nhim during his time as apprentice to Ghiberti \u2013 which\nalso shows how Donatello was able to fuse art styles\nfrom across different time periods.\nDonatello goes on to depict the Virgin in Child in\na heavily detailed form of marble relief called schiac-ciato. This time the mother and child gaze into each\nother\u2019s eyes in side profile; a contrast to most depictions which have the Virgin holding the Child in front\nprofile. The scene is immensely intimate and captures\nthe deep connection which a mother has for her child.\nThis image brings such venerated characters into the\ndomains of reality, allowing us to sympathise and relate\nto these lofty figures.\nThe culmination of Donatello\u2019s skill at capturing human emotion and craftsmanship is exemplified in his\ndepiction of The Lamentation over the Dead Christ.\nChrist lies dead, while the surrounding characters are\nstricken with grief and anguish; they tear at their hair\nand scream at the heavens while the lifeless expression\non Mary\u2019s face and her hollow eyes brings out the feeling of insurmountable grief. The expert handling of\nbronze \u2013 featuring both polished bronze for Christ\nand unpolished bronze for the surrounding figures \u2013\nfurther highlights Donetello\u2019s skill as an expert metal-worker.\nWhat the V&A presents is a way to not only connect\nwith Donatello\u2019s artistic virtuosity in multiple media,\nbut also to see how Donatello set a precedent in how\nemotion and complex characteristics can be conveyed\nto the viewer. We are guided effectively through Donatello\u2019s life and his works, and the V&A\u2019s exhibit has\ndeepened our understanding of this great master, allowing us to connect with the artist and his works; one\nleaves with a fired passion for this artist\u2019s masterpieces\nandtempersourknowledgeofhislifeandhisinfluences.\nDonatello: Sculpting the Renaissance\nTheV&A\u2019smasterfullycuratedexhibit on one of the Renaissance\u2019s greatest artists.\nGilbert Jackson Arts Editor\nArt Exhibit Review\nMusic While You Walk\nThe exhibit viewing experience can always be\nenhanced by music appropriate for your viewing.\nHere are some music recomendations for this\nexhibit!\n1.

The characters do have time to rest and\ntalk, and in this she feels there is an \u2018if things were\ndifferent\u2019 undertone.\nWhat Glass most wants from the book is for readers\nto \u201cfall for the characters and to want to come back\u201d.\nShe sees it as escapism, taking people out of their own\nlives for a while, and wants readers to form a bond\nwith the characters and want to read future books \u2013\nbecause there will be future instalments in this Alias\nEmma series. The character she feels the strongest\nconnection with is Jay Gatsby; she would like him to\nbe real, and that\u2019s what she wants others to feel about\nMakepeace.\nWe have another sip of tea and move on to talking\nabout creating the spy world that she wants readers to\nreturn to. \u201cThe real spy world is nothing like in books\nand films \u2013 it\u2019s always a fantasy (Fleming knew what\nhewasdoingwhenhe created Bond\u2019s world).Mymain\ncharacter doesn\u2019t have loads of [fanciful] gadgets or\n\u2018superpowers\u2019, because the real job relies largely on an\nindividual\u2019s own skill set, intelligence, and capability\n\u2013 not on flying cars!\u201d\nDespite this, it sounds as though many of the\ngovernment intelligence buildings are nice and\nmodern \u2013 the result of a campaign by Tony Blair.\nLowering her voice, she says \u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure if\nI\u2019m supposed to say this, but the giant MI5 doors can\nclose up to form a fortress\u201d. (If you\u2019re ever planning an\nattack on British intelligence, take notes.) Although\nthe shiny new facilities sound fancy, Glass tells me she\nreally loves the older agency buildings in Westminster\n\u2013 the ones with majestic old marble staircases \u2013 and\nthatshemodelledTheChase\u2019sagencymoreafterthose.\nShe\u2019s wanted to come to London ever since she\nsaw Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a child, and had done\nsome backpacking in Europe and Latin America when\nshe was younger. I enquire as to whether people ever\nget thrown off by her accent, which is an interesting\nmixture of American and British pronunciations.\nShe says \u201cyes, and my husband sometimes points out\nwhen I pronounce certain words in a very British way,\nand I often don\u2019t even realise!\u201d She then tells me that\nwith my \u2018international school\u2019 accent, I would make a\nreally good spy, and I think that\u2019s probably the coolest\nthing anyone\u2019s ever said to me.\nGlassisalwaysreading;shementionsthisinresponse\nto whether or not she also enjoys reading books from\nher novel\u2019s genre. This is because she\u2019s constantly\nreading through new submissions at the publishing\nhouse, but unfortunately that means she finds it hard\nto read other books, like recommendations from\nfriends. Although she doesn\u2019t like to read too much\ncrime or thriller nowadays, she talks about her love of\nle Carre\u2019s novels and laments the \u2018instant gratification\u2019\nfactor:\n\u201cHe takes his time to craft the story and doesn\u2019t get\nto the point for a long time, but it\u2019s beautiful waiting\nfor the plot to appear. You can read at least twenty\npages without even getting to the crux of his novel.\nWhereas now, I think readers and editors have got\nmore impatient \u2013 it\u2019s an impatient world.\u201d\nTo my question of who her male and female role\nmodels are, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t really have any!\u201d That\nbeing said, noteworthy women she admires include\nVirginiaHall\u2013\u201coneofthemostamazingandrecklessly\nbrave spies in history (WW2); she was Germany\u2019s\nnumber one [target] for a while, but managed to\nstay under the radar, like quicksilver\u201d\n\u2013 and Madeleine Albright. \u201cThey\u2019re\nwomen who started with nothing but\nachieved a great deal\u201d; she respects\nthat they \u201cfought their way up, rather\nthan starting with a leg up\u201d or \u2018starting\nat third base\u2019 as they apparently say in\nTexas!\nA man she admires is F. Scott\nFitzgerald, author of The Great\nGatsby, who she finds endlessly\nfascinating. Although fascinating,\nGlass says she wouldn\u2019t want to be like\nhim and wouldn\u2019t recommend trying\nto be either \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to be like\nanybody \u2013 everybody\u2019s flawed\u201d.\nAsked what her favourite period of\nlife has been so far, Glass says \u201cnow \u2013\nbut I would have said \u2018now\u2019 at any other point in my\nlife as well\u201d.\n\u201cI love writing novels, and that I\u2019ve got the\nopportunity to do so. I\u2019ve got everything I wanted\nwhen I was little, and everything so far has just been\na gift. Even though there have been many backwards\nsteps, it\u2019s never in a bad way, and I just relish the\njourney; there\u2019s no specific destination and awards\ncan\u2019t always be the goal. You need to find a way to do\nyour art, no matter how hard it is.\u201d\nAs I usually do, I ask what advice she would give\nto Imperial students, and to women in particular, and\nshe responds: \u201clife won\u2019t be what you think it will,\nand that\u2019s fine, but be ready to not achieve the goal\nyou set when you were 19\u201d. This isn\u2019t due to a lack of\nfaith, but rather an understanding that you can never\nknow where you\u2019ll be in five, ten, or even a year\u2019s time.\n\u201cAt 19 I wanted to write for The New York Times,\nand although I was a freelancer there for a while,\neveryone I spoke to about it said not to work there.\nSo I shifted my goals, because what else could I do?\n[Goals] should never stay the same for long, as it\u2019s easy\nto give up on things when you\u2019re reaching 30 years old\nand still haven\u2019t achieved goals you set as a teenager.\nI\u2019ve had four careers so far, because I keep changing\n[as a person], and I can still have a fifth career if I want\nto! Move with what comes your way and go with the\nflow.\u201d\nI like to end interviews on a less serious note, and\nso I ask Glass what her favourite Underground line\nis. She thinks for a moment and then says Bakerloo;\nit\u2019s physically shallower, it feels historical and has\na connection to Sherlock Holmes (Baker Street),\nand there are lots of interesting places to visit on it!\nDespite the insipid question, somehow her answer\nmanages to pull together the elements of her life and\npersonality that we talked about.\nAva was a gracious host, and I look forward to\nmeeting her again on Thursday 16th March, when\nshe\u2019ll be visiting Imperial to talk more about her life\nand the book at an event hosted by IC Book Club!\nfelix Books x IC Book Club\nhost Ava Glass at Imperial\nAva Glass\u2019s debut novel The Chase is a modern take on your classic spy thriller. The tale of secret agent Emma Makepeace, the title\npresents a woman\u2019s version of what it\u2019s like to work in espionage and\nsecret intelligence, based in part on Glass\u2019s own experience as a civil\nservant in the UK with the second-highest rank of security clear-ance.

    "content": "Imeet Ava Glass at The Ivy Club in downtown Soho,\nwhich is discreetly situated above a glass-doored\nmarble-covered flower shop. I\u2019m greeted by a reception\ndesk who help me put my bags in a cloakroom and then\npersonally lead me over to the table and comfy chairs\nwhere Glass is waiting. We chat a little about our lives\nwhile I get myself sorted out; she\u2019s very warm and well-composed, something that is particularly apparent\nwhen sitting next to me fumbling with my seven-year-old falling-apart backpack stuffed to the brim.\nShe has only ordered a sparkling water when I\narrive but convinces me to have a spot of tea with her,\nwhich I gratefully accept. This is the first in-person\ninterview I\u2019ve done for the paper, and I\u2019m lucky to\nbe hosted in such lovely surroundings. They appear\nlavish, but Glass deserves to indulge herself after years\nspent working her way up to where she is now; even\nshe can\u2019t quite believe it, as she says to me: \u201chow am I\neven in this club right now?\u201d.\nAskingabouthereducationandcareerbackground,\nGlass tells me she studied in the US, receiving a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in journalism from Texas A&M\nUniversity, a subsidiary college of the University\nof Texas. Coming from a relatively underprivileged\nbackground \u2013 \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with money, and my\nfamily weren\u2019t readers or particularly educated,\u201d \u2013 she\nworked hard, landing a job as a crime reporter after\ngraduating.\nThe way she describes it, crime reporting is just as\nenthralling as you would expect, and especially so for\na 22-year-old graduate. She tells me that \u201cyou can get\nvery close to everything, with no separation between\nyourself,thevictims,thesuspects,andthepolice\u201d.Glass\nwas really on the front lines with everyone involved,\nand \u201cthis taught [her] a lot about life and writing\u201d.\n\u201cYou also learn a lot about morality in how much you\ncan actually report on.\u201d She calls it \u201celementary school\nfor reporting\u201d and feels she matured a lot in the eight\nyears she worked in the field.\nGlass did a lot of freelance writing before being\noffered work on a project for Time Out magazine,\nbasedinLondon.\u201cIdon\u2019tknowhowtheychosetogive\nmeavisa,butIwasluckywithapersonattheembassy.\u201d\nHaving secured a work visa, she moved her life over to\nLondon, where she then worked in publishing for five\nyears. Looking back on her time spent with Time Out,\nshe says, with her eyes lighting up, \u201cthe London media\nwas wild, and everyone there was smart, capable, and\nfunny\u201d. Again, she was learning lots about writing,\nediting, and just about life.\nOnce that job ended, Glass found herself at a career\ncrossroads, with no particular direction in sight, until\na friend who was working for the Home Office pegged\nher for a civil service job. As \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t get\nscared\u201d she seemed perfect for a role involving writing\nabout counter-terrorism.\nSo, for the next five years, Glass worked in the\ncounter-terrorism job, of which she says, \u201cit was\ntricky, because it was almost all new, and I had to\nlearn everything, especially since journalism and\ngovernment work are almost in opposition\u201d.\n\u201cI was trying not to look like an idiot, by saying\n\u2018yes I understand\u2019\u2026while furiously making notes to\ngo through later. But then I found out everyone knew\nI was learning [on the job] anyway! It was complex\nand difficult work, and dangerous, because there were\npeople who didn\u2019t want me doing it.\u201d\nAlthough it was challenging, she still found it\nrewarding: \u201conce I cracked it [a job] I would move on\nand start learning something else\u201d. She also feels she\nwas helping others in the best way she could.\nSince retiring as a civil servant, Glass has been\nworking in publishing, and started running a\nfiction imprint in lockdown. Here she continues\nto help people in a different way; getting new\nbooks that she loves published. Among her recent\nfavourites are Blue Running by Lori Ann Stephens\nand The Coming Darkness by Greg Mosse, both of\nwhich are close to her heart. The imprint spans a huge\nrange of genres, but focuses on crime, thrillers, and\n\u2018Book Club fiction\u2019 (although we both agree that the\nlatter is hardly an effective descriptor for a novel).\nThis leads nicely into the topic I\u2019m here to discuss\nwith her \u2013 the release of her debut novel The Chase (a\nreview of the novel can be found on page 19). When\nshe started working in the world of secret intelligence,\nshe brushed up on her spy fiction reading with classic\nauthors like Ian Fleming and John le Carre.\nOne of the elements that struck her was \u201chow\nwomen were portrayed \u2013 which was almost not at\nall, but usually as sex objects, objects of fun, or just as\nhelpers. Whereas what I had seen [in the intelligence\njob] was that there were just as many women as men,\nandthattheyweredoingtheexactsamejobandtaking\nthe same risks. They were just as smart, as capable, and\nas brave.\u201d\nSo, wanting to portray these experiences, she based\nthe main character of The Chase \u2013 Emma Makepeace\n\u2013 on the first female spy she ever met. Wide-eyed,\nGlass recalls the meeting to me: \u201cShe was 28 \u2013 or at\nleast I think she was \u2013 and I didn\u2019t know she was a spy\nuntil after the job was completed. It was like meeting\na ghost, because [afterwards] I realised I had no idea\nwho I was talking to \u2013 it\u2019s an imbalanced relationship,\nbecause they have full security clearance [so know\neverything about you while you know nothing about\nthem ]. The world is one of tremendous distrust.\u201d\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nAva Glass: author of The Chase, a\nwoman\u2019s response to James Bond\nAuthor Interview\nZanna Buckland Co-Editor-in-Chief\nWe had the pleasure of speaking to Ava, who spilled what it\u2019s like working in crime\njournalism and civil service, moving cities, living in the \u2018now\u2019, and lots about books!\nIT WAS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT\nWORK, AND DANGEROUS,\nBECAUSE THERE WERE PEOPLE\nWHO DIDN\u2019T WANT ME DOING IT.\n\u201c\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 17\nFRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\nBOOKS\nSHE WAS 28 \u2013 OR AT LEAST I\nTHINK SHE WAS \u2013 AND I DIDN\u2019T\nKNOW SHE WAS A SPY UNTIL\nAFTER THE JOB WAS COMPLETED.\n\u201c\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"

    "content": "The first Prada store was opened in Italy, 1993 as\n\u2018Fratelli Prada\u2019 by Mario Prada, and the store\nprimarily sold bags, clothes steamers, and travel\naccessories. During the 1990s, Miuccia Prada,\nthe designer\u2019s granddaughter, and her husband\nPatrizio Bertelli, developed Prada into a symbol of\ninternational luxury fashion and prestige. Today, Prada\nis one of the most recognisable and iconic brands in\nfashion history.\nThis quote perfectly illustrates Prada\u2019s attitude\ntowards risk: the brand is known for its culture of\nexperimentation which has been a key factor in its\nsuccess. According to Patrizio Bertelli, Prada has\nmanaged to cope well with the unpredictable and the\nunexpected. In the 1990s, Prada believed that its\nfuture relied on gaining market share in Europe and\nthe United States. After a succession of events, in 2011\nPrada finally launched their IPO in Hong Kong,\ninstead of in Milan. The luxury house took a chance\n(and quite a big risk!) by investing in emerging\nmarketssuchasIndia,China,andRussia,wherealotof\nunrestful events were happening. It didn\u2019t bank on the\nsafe bet offered by the market in the West. However,\nthis worked out well for them, as in 2012, China sales\nconstituted 22% of its revenue, while in 2021, Asia\u2019s\nnet sales share was 39%.\nPrada also took risks by acquiring other\nfashion brands such as Helmut Lang, Jil Sander, and\nFendi,withtheideaofcreatingaluxuryItalianholding.\nHowever, Helmut Lang and Jil Sander left and\nPrada also eventually had to sell its stakes of Fendi.\nIn this case, the company took the risk and failed,\nmeaning they had to re-concentrate efforts on the\nbrand itself and its smaller core brands.\nIn 2007, with electronics brand LG, Prada\ndeveloped the LG Prada; the first smartphone with a\ncapacitive touchscreen. At the time it was \u2018definitely a\nworthycompetitortotheiPhone\u2019accordingtoareview\npublished on Gizmodo. However, the iPhone eventually overtook the LG Prada, and the latter ceased to be\nable to compete with Apple\u2019s tremendous\u2019 success. This\ncan be considered a type I error; the brand bet on an\ninnovation that turned out to be a failure.\nUltimately though, Prada\u2019s pattern of risk taking\nhas been essential to its success, as it has consistently\npushed the boundaries of fashion, innovation, and cre-ativity. Miuccia Prada launched the famous \u2018ugly chic\u2019\nstyle. She defended the decision to disagree with the\ndesigns that everyone else seems to agree on. And that\nworked. Prada was actually named \u2018the world\u2019s hottest fashion brand\u2019 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The\nbrand\u2019s products remain highly valued and highly differentiable from other luxury houses\u2019 products. Prada\nis therefore a market-driving business, which proac-tively influences customers and reveals their incipient\nneeds. Prada accepts taking all these risks and doesn\u2019t\nfear failure, because they are optimistic.\nPrada is not arrogant or overconfident. It knows\nwhen to cannibalise its own products. Near the brand\u2019s\nestablishment, Mr Bertelli advised the discontinuation\nof importing English goods, in favour by Italian ones.\nIn 1994, he also chose to cannibalise its best selling\nbags - he decided to stop producing them, in order to\nmove on and produce the \u2018next\u2019 line. Prada was willing\nto let go of ongoing success to ensure that their offering\nwould resonate with consumers in the future. On the\nother hand, besides cannibalising, Prada has expanded\nits products line - it continued the tradition of producing high-quality bags and luggage and it expanded\nto footwear, women\u2019s wear, men\u2019s wear, etc. However,\naccording to Sebastian Suhl, one of Prada\u2019s previous\nCOO, \u2018Miu Miu and Prada do not cannibalise, they\nare friendly competitors\u2019.\nIn 2019, Prada partnered with UNESCO\u2019s\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission to\nlaunch the SEA BEYOND program to raise awareness of ocean pollution. This project, which combined\nocean literacy and sustainable fashion, was recognized\nat the Sustainable Fashion Awards 2022. Furthermore,\nto prove it\u2019s adapting to the concerns of today\u2019s society,\nPrada decided to showcase its sustainable fashion solutions by launching the #PradaReNylon hashtag. This\nallowed customers to observe how the brand sustaina-bly produces nylon in its factories in China.\nPrada focuses on the future by continuing to develop\nsustainable fashion solutions and expanding its digital\npresence. Prada is also a leader in the use of technology to create new products and experiences, such as its\naugmented reality app. The app is described on Prada\u2019s\nwebsite as \u2018an innovative way to directly experience its\nuniverse\u2019. Prada is ranked 3rd out of all luxury fashion\nbrands in terms of metaverse readiness.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n14\nARTS\nExploring Prada\u2019s innovations...\nFashion Article\nOnPrada\u2019sinnovativenature and its cannibalistic tendencies.\nAnna Brogard Arts Writer\nPrada sotre in Milan, Italy.\nPrada\u2019s \u2018Ugly-chic\u2019 collection.\nCredit: Anna Brogard\nCredit: Anna Brogard\nIN OUR BUSINESS YOU CANNOT\nGET ANYWHERE WITHOUT TAKING A\nLEAP INTO THE DARK.

However, on 20th\nFebruary, many students were greeted by a \u2018guerilla exhibition\u2019 on\ntheir way to morning lectures.\nThe exhibition highlighted how\nscientists frustrated about climate\ninactivity are turning to activism\ngroups like Extinction Rebellion.\nPhotographer Neal Haddway does\nan excellent job capturing the hopes and fears\nin the eyes of each climate activist on cam-era. There is urgency and passion between the\nlines of every quote on display.

After\ndescribing his journey at Imperial so far,\nProfessor Green explained how Imperial\nneeds to work on sustainability at three levels \u2013\nindividuals and research groups, academic departments, and the College as whole. He\ncongratulated the success of the Sustainable\nFood and Drink Policy, saying that the College\u2019s\ntransport and energy policies need to follow Taste\nImperial\u2019s example. The lack of data collection\nand reporting was emphasised throughout the\nspeech \u2013 but for every negative sentence about\nthe College\u2019s sustainability metrics, there was an\nappreciation for the students and staff keeping the\npressure on Imperial to become greener faster.\nAfter the talk, attendees could visit stalls\nhighlighting current initiatives to make Imperial more sustainable. Stalls were hosted by the\nGrantham Institute, Move Imperial, Taste\nImperial, Energy Futures Lab, and the Laboratory\nEfficiency Assessment Framework.\nStudents Organising for Sustainability (SOS) also\nhad a stall, where\nrepresentatives encouraged Imperial\nstudents to save\nenergy at home.\nAnyone who joined\nthe SOS mailing\nlist received a free\nenergy-efficient\nlightbulb, a fitting memento for the bright future of\nImperial\u2019s sustainability policies.\nYou can help out by: signing up to the SOS\nnewsletter, and following their advice on making\nstudent accommodation better for your wallet\nand the planet.\n\u201cWe set high\nstandards\nacross a range\nof activities, and\nthat needs to\napply to\nsustainability\u201d\n- Prof Tim Green\n20th\nFebruary: Climate\n\u2018Guerilla exhibition\u2019 at Imperial Business School, credit: Neal Haddaway\ni\n\n"

    "content": "the 70s. It\u2019s an interesting convention\nbecause it integrates issues not only\nabout environment and wildlife, but it\u2019s\nabout trade, it\u2019s about development. It\u2019s\nabout regulating a trade that could have\nanimpactonwildlifebutnotsaying\u201cno\u201d,\nwith an understanding that for many\ncountries their natural resources are\nwhat they trade in. Of course, if there\u2019s\noverexploitation something has to be\ndone-theconcernwasthatspecieswere\ngoing extinct and endangered because\nof overexploitation. The other thing\nthat makes [CITES] very interesting\nis the fact that there\u2019s voting allowed\nand compliance measures. With a lot\nof newer conventions everything has\nto be consensus, and it\u2019s very difficult\nsometimes to adopt certain things. Here\nwe try for consensus, but if it doesn\u2019t, the\nparties say, \u201cit goes to a vote\u201d. Very few\nenvironmental conventions will have\ncompliance measures. If you\u2019re told with\na compliance measure that you can\u2019t\ntrade in that species, no party can trade\nwith you. That\u2019s a huge punishment,\nso you have an incentive to be able to\nclean up your act and ensure that the\ntrade that you\u2019re doing is sustainable,\nlegal and traceable. Making sure that\nwildlife was able to survive in the wild\nfor future generations was really the\nbasis of [CITES] \u2013 that trade could go\non but not that it would be detrimental\nto the survival of the species. Those\nwere interesting times, and they were\nable to adopt a convention which had\ncompliance measures that could be\nvoted on that has existed until now.\nMarie: How have the objectives\nof CITES changed since its initial\nestablishment 50 years ago?\nIvonne: I would say the objectives\nof the convention haven\u2019t changed\nat all. There\u2019s mechanisms under\nthe convention to adapt by having\nresolutions. The meeting of the\nConferenceoftheParties(CoP)happens\nevery3years\u2013whentheymeet,theytake\ndecisions and see emerging issues. When\nwehadtheCoPinPanamalastyear,there\nwas a revision to [one] resolution so it\u2019ll\nsay \u2018Resolution CoP17, revised CoP19\u2019.\nAnd they can make new resolutions.\nImagine in the 70s, when things were\ntaken directly from the wild to be\nused as some sort of commerce. Then\n[came] the idea of ranching, the idea of\ncaptive breeding, artificial propagation.\nToday we do biotechnology, where\nyou can develop things in a laboratory\nsituation or change the genetic material\nof plants. The convention has had to\nkeep up with that \u2013 they have made\ntools to register, for example, facilities\ndoing captive breeding. You still have\nto have permitting even if it\u2019s artificial\npropagation, even if it\u2019s captive bred.\nThere\u2019s a working group set up to see\nwhat\u2019s CITES\u2019 role in biotechnology.\nAll of these tools help to keep up to date\nwith what\u2019s happening.\nIt\u2019s still not resolved 100% how\nthe [COVID-19] zoonosis happened\nbetween animals and humans. There was\nbig talk of pangolins, wet markets, some\nstillsaythatitmighthavebeensomething\nin the lab - it\u2019s still unknown. There\u2019s\nno doubt that wildlife has something\nto do with this, so now we have to see\nwhat things need to be done to avoid the\nnext pandemic. The International Air\nTransport Association has specific rules\ndeveloped working with CITES for the\nsafe transport of animals by air. There\nhas to be some work done by land as well\nbecause between countries, you have to\nbe sure - has a veterinarian taken a look\nat these animals? Are different species\nbeing crowded into one cage? The fear\nis that because of the stress, they\u2019re\nreleasingvirusesandeventuallyitgoesto\nthehuman.Theconventionhastoadapt,\nand the parties are addressing that.\nOh, Internet! [It\u2019s] much more\ndifficult to find [people] that open up\none [account], close, open up a different\none, and illegal trade happens. We have\ndeveloped tools to find out when these\nare happening, what kind of steps to\ntake. A lot of those doing wildlife crime\narebigcriminalorganisations-thesame\nones that are doing crime with weapons,\nhuman trafficking, drug trafficking.\nThey have the same networks, they\u2019re\nemploying poor people on the ground to\ntake whatever it is that they want. Trade\nis neither good nor bad, it\u2019s just how you\ndo it. You have to make sure that you\nhave the right regulations for it.\nSimran: World Wildlife Day is on\nMarch 3rd, and the theme this year is\n\u2018PartnershipsforWildlifeConservation\u2019.\nWhat other partnerships does CITES\nhave?\nIvonne: This was a good theme to\npick for World Wildlife Day because all\nalong it\u2019s been partnerships. No country\ncan do it alone \u2014 they have to work\nwith others, especially when it comes to\nillegal wildlife trade. If you know there\u2019s\nsomething in the shipment, you need\nto call your colleagues in enforcement\nand customs authorities. These are the\nimportant partnerships that we have\nas CITES, with INTERPOL, World\nCustoms Organisation, United Nations\nOffice on Drugs and Crime, World\nBank \u2026 we\u2019re all working together. It\u2019s\ncalled the International Consortium to\nCombat Wildlife Crime.\nWe\u2019ve just now had to put a ban in\nWesternAfricafortheAfricanrosewood,\nbecause the scientific document to show\nhow much they can actually trade to\nmakeitsustainable,the\u2018legalacquisition\nfindings\u2019 to show that all along the value\nchain this is something that has been\nobtained legally \u2026 those documents\ndidn\u2019t exist. For that kind of work we\nhave to work together with forestry\norganisations, primariy the Food and\nAgriculture Organisation (FAO).\nWe have [worked] with FAO as well\non marine species, when a proposal\ncomes through to list this particular\nmarine species. What was very exciting\nabout this last CoP, that was all over\nthe global media, was about the sharks\nand rays - [previously] most of them\nneeded no permits to be traded.

    "content": "Ant-Man\u2019s quantum-realm world is one of jelly-like\nsubstances and neon, luminescent colours. The native\ninhabitants mingle with those who have been trapped\nthere, and strangely enough, the prime evolutionary\nstate still seems to be humanoid, although essentially\nno thought was given to the form of the average quan-tum-person besides being as random as possible. It\u2019s\nhard not to see this as lazy, when there is little scientific\nevidence to suggest that life in other realms or on other planets would take human form and when there\u2019s\na seemingly endless budget allocated to Marvel films.\nThe visual effects were also a letdown, which, again,\nfeels like laziness given that Disney is one of the biggest production companies in the world and has been\nworking on animation and visual effects for 100 years\nnow. There is a kind of \u2018scanning\u2019 motion that has been\nused in many Marvel films recently, by which less care\nis taken to fully render other-worldly scenes. This can\nbe seen in the likes of Multiverse of Madness and Thor:\nLove and Thunder.\nOne of the great things about the original Iron-Man\nand Captain America films was that, while the technologies produced on-screen were clearly still a fantasy,\nthere was something about them that felt tangible. By\ncomparison, the lack of explanation attached to the\n\u2018quantum satellite\u2019 device presented in Quantumania\nis laughable; skimming over the technical aspects of it\nand barely giving the audience a chance to try and understand the pseudoscience behind the satellite.\nThis complete disconnection from the real-world is\nperfectly fine if, as in Thor, Dr. Strange, and Guardians\nof the Galaxy, we are dealing with alternate planets and\nuniverses. I was equally as willing to suspend my disbelief with travel to the quantum realm, but only if there\nwas evidence of some dedicated thought being put into\nthe creation of such a world.\nUnderneath all this was some semblance of a plot,\nbut between the absence of meaningful dialogue and\nthe pure chaos that was the film\u2019s visuals, many of the\ncharacter-building elements were lost on me. Scott\nand Cassie Lang had several slightly awkward bonding\nmoments, Hope and her mother, Janet, work through\nsome emotional tension in the background, and Bill\nMurray appeared for 0.1 seconds to act as \u2018the other\nguy\u2019 \u2013 the catalyst for Michael Douglas\u2019s metamorphosis into a true hero. Kang and Janet revive and resettle\na past dispute, and a bunch of giant (for the quantum\nrealm) ants save the day.\nI may have just been too tired to give them the benefit of the doubt and fully understand the plot. I won\u2019t\nlie to you; I\u2019m not entirely sure how the film actually\nwrapped up, but then again, I don\u2019t think I really need\nto know either.\nIt may be that Marvel set their standards too high in\nthe first two phases, and are now struggling to authentically replicate the charm and camaraderie that was\nthe shining light of those early films. I may be focusing\ntoo much on little details and being pedantic, but then,\nonce a standard is set, it\u2019s hard to not hold every new\nproject to that same high bar. I appreciate the work\nthat was done by the cast and crew, but sometimes >>\nqueror - to raise the stakes. I mean, yeah, he\u2019s stuck in\nthe quantum realm right now, sure, but if he gets out\n\u2013 ohhhh, then you\u2019re all really fucked. Luckily, his only\nweaknesses are the power of family, a guy who could\n\u201cdo this all day\u201d, and a well-timed kick in the nuts. It\nmight be a bit unfair to criticise a superhero movie for\nhaving a caricatured villain, and there is definitely some\nblame to be placed upon the source material. However, Marvel is clearly capable of putting great villains\non screen \u2013 everyone\u2019s favourite Malthusian, Thanos,\nmight not be the most philosophically complicated\nbad guy ever but he was interesting, morally complex\nto an extent, and he kicked everybody\u2019s ass at first. Although perhaps trying to one-up Thanos in every film\nis exactly the problem \u2013 maybe everyman Scott Lang\nneeds a more everyday villain.\nAll that being said, the film still had character, and\nI did find myself invested in the outcomes of the AntMan family, so it definitely doesn\u2019t rank amongst the\nworst of the MCU blockbusters. As an enjoyable, fam-ily-friendly adventure the film definitely still has its\nmerits.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n52 film.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFILM & TV\nmore before they started punching each other.\nUnfortunately, when a film doesn\u2019t give itself time to\ndevelopanything,butstillwantstointroduceabunchof\nnewenvironmentsandcharacters,itinevitablyhastore-sorttoshorthandtoquicklygetthebulletpointsacross.\nThismeansstereotypesandcliches,whicharecommonplace in Ant-Man 3.

    "content": "On 13th\nFebruary 2023 shortly before 03:00 GMT, a small 1m\nasteroid was seen creating a stunning\nshooting star as it entered the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere and impacted the Earth\nsafely near to the French city of Rouen.\nAuthorities and space agencies are\nawareofmorethan1.1millionasteroids,\nwith around 30,600 (2.7%) travelling in\nan orbit that brings them near Earth\u2019s\nown. The asteroid, originally named\nSar2667, was a unique addition to this\nextensive list, in that it is only one of\nseven asteroids that we have been capable of detecting before its impact with\nEarth.IsatdownwithSamDeen,a\u2018semiamateur astronomer\u2019 who was involved in following up the discovery of the asteroid, coupled with the\noutreach of its impact with Earth.\nDetecting Sar2667\nSam is a subscriber to the Minor\nPlanet Mailing List (MPML), which\nis an online active list for the minor\nplanet (asteroid) community. The\nMPMLispopulatedwiththeworld\u2019sbest\namateur astronomers, as well as many\nprofessional astronomers involved in all\nfacetsofasteroidandcometresearch.Sam\nwas alerted on the platform shortly after\nits discovery by Hungarian astronomer\nKriszti\u00e1n S\u00e1rneczky, he recalls the event:\n\u201cI had a look at initial observations \u2013\nand thought \u2018wow \u2013 it\u2019s real! It\u2019s there!\u2019\".\nThe ability to predict an asteroid before it hits us is extremely new \u2013 being\nable to see its trajectory in the hours\nthat follow and to track its impact to\nthe exact second was extraordinary\u201d.\nHistorically, detecting objects like as-teroidsandsupernovaewasdonethrough\nthousands of comparisons of astronomical plates. Now, the process is automated\nwith software. \u201cOnce you find and detectanobject,it\u2019suploadedtotheMinor\nPlanet Centre, an official body for observing and reporting on minor planets\u201d.\n\u201cAs it\u2019s uploaded to the data-base, other observatories around the\nworld can follow up and take more\nmeasurements of the object. The longer\nwe observe the object for, the more we\ncanunderstanditsorbit\u2013whichrequires\nlots of observations. This procedure was\nfollowed for Sar2667, which after initial\nobservations we realised this asteroid\nwasdoingsomethingthatasteroidsdon\u2019t\nusually do. In the first few observations,\nit was moving distinctly slower than in\nthelasttwoobservations:whenanaster-oid is distinctly changing its speed over\na few minutes, that\u2019s when you should\nstart to be concerned \u2013 that either\nmeans the object is an alien spacecraft\n\u2013 or it is moving directly towards you!\u201d.\nTalking briefly about the specifics of\nthe asteroid, Sam made some comments\nregardingitssize:\u201citwasverysmallcompared to other asteroids, which makes it\nextremely difficult to find, as small asteroidsarerarelydetectedwhenthey\u2019renot\nclose to Earth. Though it isn\u2019t the smallest we\u2019ve observed \u2013 that one was an as-teroidthatfelloverOntario,Canadalast\nyear \u2013 it is certainly one of the smallest.\u201d\nThe Sar2667 asteroid was ~1m in\nlength; objects of this size typically\nimpact Earth once every week or two.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from finding none of\nthese, to now finding one every month.\nI think asteroid detection will become\nas predictable as solar eclipses \u2013 which\nis remarkable for the field of astrono-my. It\u2019s also quite remarkable to probe\nhow these tiny objects orbit. Smaller asteroids are usually unstable, they\ndon\u2019t survive in the solar system for too\nlong; instead, they usually spin really\nquick due to the sun, break up into tiny\npieces, and cross the Earth hundreds of\nthousands of times. It so happened\nto be for Sar2667 that it didn\u2019t avoid\nEarth this time \u2013 it resulted in impact\u201d.\nThe importance of open data\nSam communicated information\nabout the asteroid impact across social\nmedia platforms alongside fellow asteroid enthusiast, Tom Williams, whose\nTikTok @tw.astrophotography has amassed\nover 1,000,000 followers of his work.\nCommunicating this event through\nTom\u2019s twitter was key to its outreach; his\ntweet informing his followers about the\nimpactwasviewedover3,500,000times.\n\u201cOne of the most impressive things we\u2019ve developed as the\nminor planet community is the openness of the data. A big thing that has\nincreased our ability to follow up these\nrare events, is our ability to report\nand document these events. This is assisted by the field of astronomy with\nthe policy of data openness \u2013 we no\nlonger have to wait months before data\nis published; nor be restricted from\nclosed access journals. The effects of\nwithholding this data would mean impacts like these would go unnoticed.\u201d\n\u201cThe Vera Rubin Observatory in\nChile is a nice example, which is coming online in December this year. One\nof the main things about this observatory which sets it apart from oth-ers: is that they have this policy of data\navailability. Anytime they discover\nsomething\u2013beitanasteroidorsupernovae \u2013 they instantly report it. That\u2019s not\nsomething anyone would\u2019ve considered\ncompetent or worth doing 20 years ago\u201d.\n\u201cPerhaps the most successful story\nof this policy is the Zooniverse citizen\nscience project.

    "content": "The 3rd of March 2023 was the 50th\nanniversary of the establishment of\nthe Convention on International Trade\nin Endangered Species (CITES). One\nof the most signed UN conventions,\nCITES is a legally binding agreement\nensuring plants and animals can be\ntraded without threatening the species\u2019\nsurvival. We had the pleasure of meeting\nIvonne Higuero, the CITES SecretaryGeneral, a few days before she flew to\nWashington to celebrate this historic\nday.\nMarie: When did your passion for\nwildlife and sustainable development\nbegin and why did you decided to apply\nthis passion by working for the UN?\nIvonne: When I was in university, I\nwas doing pre-med in the United States.\nIn the United States, you have to take all\nthese other classes [outside your degree\nmajor]. So I took a class in ecology and\nenvironmental studies and I loved it. I\nwas already thinking [a medical degree]\nmight be difficult because in the United\nStates\u2026itwaseightyears,andfinancially\nit wasn\u2019t very easy. But when I took this\n[ecology] class I thought \u2013 this is great.\n[We read] a book called Silent Spring\nby Rachel Carson, about chemicals\ndamaging water and how [aquatic]\nspecies were dying. Being in the United\nStates \u2013 the Endangered Species Act, the\nClean Air Act, and so many things that\n... had just happened in the seventies \u2013\nreally made an impression on me when I\ntookthatclass.Idecidedtolookintothe\npossibilityofthengettingahigherdegree\nin environmental studies. So in the end,\nI went to Duke University. They had\nwhat they called at the time the School\nof Forestry and Environmental Studies,\nand I chose to get a master\u2019s degree in\nenvironmental management that has a\nfocus on economics and policy - what\nwe call an ecological economist or an\nenvironmental economist. That really\nled me to look at things internationally\nMy first job was at the Organisation\nof American States in Washington,\nworking with mostly Latin America and\nthe Caribbean, on disaster preparedness.\nIt was something that was a little bit\noutside of what I had studied. But I\nsaid, \u2018well, this will give me a flavour of\nwhat it\u2019s like to work in the international\narena\u2019 \u2013 and that was when it became\nvery clear that that\u2019s where my goal was\nheaded.Iendedupgettingaconsultancy\n[job] working at UNEP, and then later a\nproperpost.Thingsworkedoutverywell\nbyopeningmyselfuptothepossibilityof\nliving elsewhere, in Nairobi. I lived there\nfor eight years working for UNEP. Then\nafterthoseeightyearsIgotahigher-level\npost here in Geneva, and have stayed\nin Geneva since then. I moved from\nUNEP to the United Nations Economic\nCommission for Europe, and I stayed\nthere five years. Then I was offered this\nposition, so I moved back to UNEP.\nIt\u2019s the Convention Secretariat \u2013 which\nmeans that we are fairly independent\nbecause the parties who have signed\nthe treaty \u2026 are the ones really in\ncharge. They take all the decisions and\nthey\u2019re the ones who have to pay for the\nsecretariat, but the Secretariat has to be\nadministered, and the administration is\ndonebyUNEP.Sothat\u2019showIendedup\nhere.\nMarie: Building on your career\nprogression, have you experienced any\nbarriers during your career so far? Such\nas being a woman in a male dominated\npolitical landscape? How did you\novercome these types of barriers?\nIvonne: When I first started out in\nNairobi, it was very much - and for a\nlong time - that the higher level posts\nwere all with men. [There were] very few\nwomen in higher level posts throughout\nthe United Nations, not only in UNEP,\nand so it seemed more difficult. Also,\nin general, they were from developed\ncountries ... and so I could see there were\ngoing to be some barriers. I have dual\ncitizenship, I\u2019m both Panamanian and\nAmerican, and so that made a little bit of\na difference. But still, the gender aspect\n- you could see that the majority of the\n[people] in the lower posts, doing a lot of\nthe heavy work, were women. It took me\neightyearstobeinthepostthatIwas.I\u2019ve\nrisen from P3 to D2 [up five ranks in the\nUN hierarchy], which is quite a success\nfor a woman from a developing country.\nDespite being perfectly\nknowledgeable about how much I\nknow, and my preparedness and my\nmanagement skills and all the rest of it,\nI give credit to the current SecretaryGeneral, Antonio Guterres. He was\nconvinced that during his time as\nSecretary-General he was going to have\nequality of the genders in [high level\nposts]. I think that I wouldn\u2019t have\nreachedthislevelifitwouldn\u2019thavebeen\nfor him pushing women and geographic\ndiversity. This Convention Secretariat\nhas only been led by men, and men from\ndeveloped countries, until I arrived. It is\nquite an incredible thing that at the end\nof the day it takes men to join us and to\nwant to make a change. If we didn\u2019t have\nmen who were convinced that gender\ndiversityandequalityamongstwomenis\nimportant, it would be much harder [for\nwomen to progress at the UN]. I\u2019ve also\ntalked to other women that are having\nkids, being a mother, having a family\n\u2013 [which] also has a certain impact\nbecause you do double jobs. You work\nin the office and you often go home and\nwork another job, as mother, wife, and\ncaregiver. It\u2019s also financially a burden\nbecause \u2026 I had to have somebody at\nhome to take care of the children so I\ncould travel [for business]. And ... you\ncan\u2019t say, \u201cno, I can\u2019t go on the mission\u201d\nif you\u2019re the person with the job, so you\nhavetogo.[Myson]travelledacoupleof\ntimeswithmewhenhewasababy,[Iwas\ntaking him and] paying for my mother\nto come ... she would watch over him\nwhile I was attending the meetings.\nMarie:March3rdmarks50yearssince\nthe establishment of CITES.

When \u2018Call Me Maybe\u2019 began to\nplay, the room erupted into deafening screams; her\nbiggest hit to date had the whole crowd nodding along\nand she even came to high five fans on the floor.\nAfter a brief outfit change, she reappeared and delivered the second act of her show. This was definitely\nmy favourite part (probably just because more of my\nfavourite songs were performed). In particular, \u2018Boy\nProblems\u2019 was absolutely perfect. Her voice sounded great, the interaction between her and the backup\nsingers was a delight to watch, and that gorgeous\nbassline had me ugly dancing. I could definitely\nhear a more mature and powerful version of Carly\u2019s voice; she clearly had a level of command over\nher instrument that only time and experience can\nbring. This was definitely one of the best vocal performances I\u2019ve ever heard.\nAllinall,Carlyandherbandputonagreatshow\nand gave the fans everything they wanted from a\npop icon.\nThe hotly-anticipated second album from Wigan natives, The Lathums.\nFormed at music college in Wigan in 2019, The\nLathums represent the latest round of indie guitar revivalism. Like many UK acts propelled to the\nforefront by die-hard local fanbases,\nThe Lathums made a name for themselves with their chart-topping debut\nHow Beautiful Life Can Be just eighteen months ago. The lads from Wigan\nclearly wanted to strike while the iron\nwas hot, releasing their second album\nFrom Nothing to a Little Bit More just\nlast week.\n\u2018Struggle\u2019 is a full-hearted and honest\nopening track. A simple melancholic\npiano intro leads us into Alex Moore\u2019s\ngentle vocals. The song then builds into\na fuller sound that is more characteristic\nof The Lathum\u2019s trademark guitar-led\ncrowd movers. Meanwhile, rich and\nsoaring vocals provide a deep sincerity,\ntelling a reflective story of loss, memory,\nandofgrowingolderandwiser.\u2018Struggle\u2019\nshowcases a burgeoning musical scope\nfrom the band echoed in later songs on\nthe record like \u2018Turmoil\u2019.\nThe next song, \u2018Say My Name\u2019, is an\nalmost abrupt change of pace. Reminiscent of your favourite 2000s indie rock,\nthe track \u2013 though approaching formulaic \u2013 is definitely going to be a crowd-pleaser at festivals this year. With lyrics portraying a conversation between someone alive and a loved one who has passed,\nthe track clearly intends to be anthemic and inspiring\nrather than depressing with its electrifying guitar and\nracing percussion. Though \u2018Say My Name\u2019 is undoubtedly self-assured in its sound, it lacks the pizzazz and\nnovelty that made their debut so powerful.\nThe band follow this with a few upbeat and charmingly old-school tracks like \u2018I know Pt1\u2019 and \u2018Lucky\nBean\u2019 that feel like a breath of fresh air across the often\nstodgy ground of northern indie-guitar rock. \u2018Lucky\nBean\u2019 offers up a story of dopamine-surging infatuation in the first flushes of romance interspersed with\nmoments reminding the listener that this is\na document of times that have passed. \u2018Facets\u2019\nis a standout track for fans of The Lathums\u2019\nearlier sound featuring eruptive guitar and\nMoore\u2019s fast-paced, almost dialogue-like lyrical\nintroduction with the song embracing a sel-dom-heard indie funk sound that is extremely\nhard not to nod along to. As the dust settles,\n\u2018Rise and Fall\u2019 provides an emotion-driven and\npensive intermission before they lead us directly into the festival-ready \u2018Sad Face Baby\u2019 \u2013 a\ntrack that clearly expresses the band\u2019s fondness\nfor a chorus designed for mass adoration.\nSlower moments of this album sit side-by-side with the band\u2019s heavier side, and at\ntimes, these two separate identities wrestle to\nproduce an album that, though unarguably\nstrong, has an undercurrent of disjointedness.\nThe Wigan four-piece unapologetically have\ntheir sights set on being an arena-filling band\nbut this has come with a slight dilution of\nthe essence that made them so strong. Hopefully, in the years to come, The Lathums will\ndemonstrate that whilst they know their\ngenre, they can also think outside the box.\nAmy Smith Music Writer\nCredit: Amanda Paul\nCarly in her second outfit.\n\n"

If I were to step back, that sharp\nedge might be slightly less sharp. It\u2019s\nhard to know.\u201d\nThe original group of nine was split\ninto two groups for trial. Knapp\u2019s group\nof four had no previous legal experience\ngoing into the trial. Through the first\ntrial and the following appeal in the\nCrown Court, he estimates that they\ncrowdfunded approximately \u00a380,000 to\nhelp with legal fees.\nTheir defence argued that there was\nno criminal damage because they had\nused chalk paint spray, which is easily\nremovable. However, the group was\nfound guilty last September in the\nMagistrate\u2019s Court.\nThe four were shocked when they\nwere found guilty. They had anticipated\narulingintheirfavour,sinceBlackLives\nMatter protestors were found not guilty\nof criminal damage after removing a\nstatueofEdwardColston,aslaveowner.\nWhen the second group was tried\na few weeks later for the same charges,\nthey were found not guilty. \u201cI couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it,\u201d Knapp said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost as\nthough it didn\u2019t matter what we said.

Life does not work in linear narratives or we would not have to ask \u201cWhat came first, the chicken or the egg?\".\nA key challenge in modern biology is to find ways to tell stories about these dynamic, non-linear processes that can aid our understanding, while supporting the open mindedness needed for progress. Leyser\u2019s research in plant developmental biology has tried to address this issue, a challenge that is\nequally relevant for her current role in science policy.

    "content": "Launch of climate anxiety journal club\nMonday ended with time for\nintrospection and optimism, at\nthe launch of the Eco-Anxiety\nJournal Club. The journal was\ndesigned by Climate Cares, a\nresearch group focusing on how\nclimate change and mental health\naffect each other. To build excitement about the journal, Dr Bill\nSheate from Imperial\u2019s Centre for\nEnvironmental Policy gave a\ntalk. He defined the symptoms\nof eco-anxiety \u2014 prioritising climate activism over personal relationships and health, and letting\nfear of the planet\u2019s future distract from the present moment. Then, Dr Emma\nLawrance from Climate Cares delved into the\ndifferent emotions climate-anxious people feel,\nand explained how we can turn these negative\nfeelings into positive climate ac-tion. She brought up the concept of solastalgia \u2013 the grief\nfelt while watching wild habitat\nbeing destroyed, especially felt\nby indigenous communities living in that habitat. Inspired by\nthe talks, attendees were encouraged to share what eco-anxiety means to them \u2013 it was\nempowering seeing people who\nhave never met before open up\nabout their mental health. Then\nclub members began working\non the journal, with the hope of\nmeeting every two weeks.\nYou can relieve climate anxiety by: spending 10\nminutes every day writing down your emotions,\ntasks, and ideas.\nClimate justice: fairness for a greener future\nThe most intersectional talk of Sustainability Week, this panel event brought together\npublic health, socioeconomic inequality, the climate and biodiversity crises, and more. Dr Ajay\nGambhir from the Grantham Institute discussed\nthe concept of a \u2018just transition\u2019 \u2013 providing\ncompensation and training to workers who have\nbeen, or will be, displaced from their jobs because of increasing environmentalism.\nUsing historical case studies, Dr Gambhir explained the role of economics and culture in ensuring the green transition does not leave anyone behind. Then, Claudia Selin-Batz from the\nGeorge Institute focused on the role of youth\nin climate justice. She pointed out that the climate crisis has damaged young people\u2019s mental\nhealth, for they will live through the worst impacts of climate change if nothing is done now.\nFollowing the delivery of a Global Youth Statement at COP27, she hopes that more young people can have a seat at United Nations tables. The\nfinal panelist was Simmone Ahiaku \u2013 a climate\njustice campaigner whose talk wove together\nenvironmentalism, neo-colonialism, corporate\ngreed, and feminism. She narrated the inspiring\nstory of the Ogoni people in Nigeria, who fought\npatriarchy and oil extraction simultaneously in\nthe 1990s. Interestingly, the questions posed to\nthe panel afterwards were more thought-pro-voking than the talks themselves. One attendee\npointed out that the climate justice movement\nhas no flagbearer, and another asked whether\nthe French \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019 movement was the\nresult of climate injustice. Overall, the event was\nintellectually and emotionally engaging.\nYou can help out by: learning more about the\nOgoni Nine and remembering them when you\nnext see the Shell logo on Imperial CSP merchandise or research posters.\nPanel of experts speaking on climate justice,\ncredit: Sustainable Imperial\nClimate journal, credit: Simran Patel\nBackground image credit: Envato Elements\nii\n\n"

    "content": "In 1948, the Supreme Court of the United States\nchanged the fate of Hollywood (and, by extension, the\nentire English-language film industry). From the silent\nera onwards, the \u2018Big Five\u2019 film studios (and the \u2018Little\nThree\u2019) were establishing a de facto oligopoly on film\nproduction and distribution; they owned the films, the\nfilm laboratories, the writers, and the majority of the\nmovie theatres (which, at the time, tended to have only\none screen). This, evidently, gave them a significant\namount of control over what showed, and what didn\u2019t\n(with a charming preference for films they themselves\nowned). United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., under the USA\u2019s anti-trust laws, decreed a separation between film distribution and exhibition, and outlawed\nand regulated various nefarious practices that the studiosusedtostrongarmthefewtheatresthattheydidn\u2019t\nown. The result was a huge increase in the number of\nindependent (of the main companies) producers, studios and movie theatres.\nIt isn\u2019t hard to see the parallels to the current state\nof the film industry. In 2021, Disney alone owned\nover 25% of the market share for film studios in North\nAmerica [statistica] with Sony following close behind\nat 23.1%. In Disney\u2019s case, the majority of that revenue\ncamefromShang-ChiandtheLegendoftheTenRings,\nBlack Widow, and Eternals. For Sony; Spider-Man:\nNoWayHomeandVenom:LetThereBeCarnage.The\ncommon thread there, if you haven\u2019t spotted it, is that\nthey are all Marvel properties. In fact, the first film on\nthe list that isn\u2019t a continuation or reboot of a pre-ex-isting franchise is Free Guy, at 10th place, from 20th\nCentury Studios \u2013 although it does contain cameos of\nlightsabers, Hulk fists, and Captain America, thanks\nentirely to the fact that 20th Century was acquired by\nDisney in 2019.\nNote that this isn\u2019t a self-indulgent Marvel-bashing\narticle (although that would still be warranted) \u2013 the\nissue isn\u2019t necessarily with the quality of Marvel films,\nbut with the zeitgeist chokehold they\u2019ve held for over\na decade. The acquisition of Marvel in 2009 allowed\nDisneytomorethandoubleitsmarketshareinthefirst\nfive years and dominate the box office for the whole\nof the 2010s. They pioneered the concept of the \u2018cinematic universe\u2019, and showed the rest of the industry\nthe money-making power of pre-existing intellectual\nproperty. Obviously, the MCU wouldn\u2019t have had as\nmuch staying power if it hadn\u2019t produced some good\nfilms to begin with, but Disney quickly realised that\nas long as they had the same narrative link and formula \u2013 be it Iron Man, Spiderman,\nor the illustri- ous \u2018crossover\u2019 \u2013 they c o u l d\np r e t t y m u c h\nc h u r n out any\nmilque-t o a s t ,\nfanser- vice feature and still make\nthe big bucks.\nT h e s e franchises\nb e c a m e even more\nvaluable as the age of streaming emerged, where the\nproduction of spin-off\nshows could drive customers towards the individual streaming services operated by each studio. Streaming also precipitated a huge\nrise in \u2018consolidation\u2019 of the industry \u2013 the purchasing of legacy studios by the dominating companies.\nIn 2016, AT&T bought Time Warner (Warner Bros.\nand HBO); in 2018, Disney made the hugely significant purchase of 20th Century Studios for $71 billion;\nand recently, in 2021, MGM Studios was bought by\nAmazon for a paltry $8.45 billion. The effect of these\npurchases is giving those companies control over an\nentire century of cultural backlog, even more existing\npopular films and shows (think about how many times\nyou\u2019ve seen the 20th Century production logo at the\nstart of a movie) to entice people onto their streaming\nsites. After Disney\u2019s purchase, they immediately began\nblocking the licensing of old 20th Century films to independent theatres \u2013 many of which rely on archive\nscreenings to stay afloat.\nPull out your bowties and your party snacks, and\ngrab either your mother or your under-25-year-old date \u2013 it\u2019s that time of year again!

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n16\nARTS\nOn the 24th of February, a night full of music, song, and dancing took place at\nMetric in Beit Quad. The fact that the dancefloor was never completely full\nwas slightly underwhelming, but by no fault of the performers\u2019, whose talents were\ndefinitely worth paying \u00a35 to experience. After chatting with a handful of people\nabouthowmusicisexactlywhatyouneedafteralongweekoflectures,andwatching\nthe sound and light technicians working their magic (that\u2019s you, Luna and Victor!),\nthe performances were ready to begin.\nHeading the set list were four of Imperial\u2019s a capella groups (sadly most of The\nTechtonics were ill, and so couldn\u2019t perform), the first of which was Take Note,\nImperial A Capella\u2019s all-female barbershop group \u2013 barbershop means either\nan all-female or all-male choral group, usually a quartet with three of the voices\nharmonising to the melody of the fourth voice \u2013 which I really enjoyed. They had\na really warm, bubbly energy and tried to get the audience to engage with them to\nboot. After them came Surcery, the youngest A Capella group at Imperial, whose\npremise is to mashup, medley, and otherwise fuse Eastern and Western music, using\nboth English and Hindi, which you can get a taste of if you visit their webpage:\nhttps://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/acappella/groups/surcery/. They were rather\ncool too. Then came The Imperielles, another all-female and non-binary group (but\nthe first one, take note), who brought an even more beautiful sound to the stage.\nYou could tell everyone in the group was there to have a good time \u2013 it was very\nwholesome. Last of the four groups (but not least!) was The Scopes, who seem to\ndo a mixture of everything, from pop to funk to jazz, and they might have been my\nfavourite: the song they performed was \u2018Electric Love\u2019 by B\u00d8RNS.\nNext up was the bands, with You Wouldn\u2019t Know Them going first. Their lighting\nrequest was \u201cdark with lots of strobe\u201d, so you might be able to get an idea of the\nsort of music they played. After them came L.A.D., who were unfortunately missing\ntheir drummer, so Luna (who had been teaching me how to use Tiger Touch \u2013 the\ncontrolsforthelights)graciouslysteppedupandimprovisedonthedrumsforthem.\nIt wasn\u2019t my sort of music, but the audience bopped and swayed along happily (the\nwonders of drinks). The next band was Xanshi, whose songs were of a similar style to\nthe band that followed them, The Pocket; both bands kept the audience moving and\nthe walls vibrating.\nThe next band, Immigrants, played a mixture of famous and original songs (the\nmost memorable one being \u2018Dog Days\u2019). The lead singer of Immigrants had just got\nmarried, and dedicated the band\u2019s final song to his partner in the audience, which\ngave the music another dimension! Pretty damn cool.\nSomehow, I ended up being the only one in charge of the lighting (sound and\nlights were provided by DramSoc, shout\nout to y\u2019all) and had a lot of fun messing\naround with those, so if you didn\u2019t like that\naspect of Arts Night, you know who to\nblame.\nI may have been deafened by Big Band,\nbut they were incredible \u2013 and so was Oli\nKeene, who sang \u2018Street Life\u2019 by Randy\nCrawford. I misheard it as \u2018Streetlight\u2019\nand made the lights go all bright and\nyellow whenever Oli sang the title word.\nThe contrast that Big Band brought to the\nstage compared to the Immigrants, was\nawesome: the atmosphere was able to shift\nfrom clubbing-like to an almost orches-tral-type setting. I was blown away.\nIt\u2019s a fact that hardly anyone notices\nwhen the person doing the lights messes\nup, and people were obviously getting progressively more intoxicated as the night\nwent on, so by the time the DJ came on\n- at roughly 1 o\u2019clock in the morning -the theme was \u2018anything goes\u2019. If A Capella\nlacks anything, it\u2019s the volume and power\nthat club lighting needs to be effective;\nwhich is why Metric would be improved if\nyoucouldblackoutthewindowsandhave\ncomplete control of the light levels.\nI\u2019m annoyed that I didn\u2019t find out\nthe name of the DJ, because they were\nactually pretty good. It\u2019s true that the\npeople on the dance floor numbered\nabout ten, but he didn\u2019t seem to care,\nand combined all kinds of songs that I\u2019d\nnever have imagined would sound good\ntogether. But all good things pass away\nand with the help of a half-blackout and\nlightsdirectedatthedoor,thelastfewdrunkenrevellerswereshoo-edoutofMetric,\nand I discovered that the adage of \u2018techies are first in and last out\u2019 is very, very true.\nFinally, many thanks to Celine, our Arts and Entertainment Board Chair, for\norganising the whole event!\nThe Arts in Metric: a review\nShowcase Review\nAneveningofmagic,creativity, and buckets of talent.\nSophie Pointon Arts Editor\nImperial A Capella groups Take Note (left) and The Scopes (right).\nGuitarist from You Wouldn't Know Them.\nLead singer of Immigrants.\nMembers of Big Band on stage.\n\n"

    "content": "Next up were Buffalo Bites and Spicy\nDrums from Oumph. The Swedish\ncompany has already won \u2018Best Brand\u2019\nat the 2021 World Food Innovation\nAwards, and tasting both products\nrevealed why. First I tried the breaded\nBuffalo Bites, which had a texture easily\nmistaken for actual chicken. The Buffalo\nsauce inside was so tangy and spicy that\nI wish there was more of it. According\nto Alternative Protein committee\nmembers, the bites are irresistibly\ncrispy when straight out the oven \u2013 they\nonlytake15minutestocookfromfrozen.\nThe second Oumph product, their Spicy\nDrums, were my favourite snack of the\nevening. Most attendees preferred these\nto the Buffalo Bites, but none of us could\nexplain why. Maybe it was the juiciness\nof the plant-based chicken, or the perfect\nratio of herbs, pepper, and chilli. It didn\u2019t\ntake long for Oumph products to enter\nmy shopping list.\nBy this point I was already stuffed,\nbut, the Radiant Foods soya mini-fillets\nlooked too attractive to turn down.\nCo-founders and Imperial alumni\nDan and Satya inspired us with the\nstory of Radiant Foods was founded.\nThey wanted to eat healthier and\neco-friendlier without giving up their\nfavourite traditional foods, a sentiment\nthat resonated with many of us. Being\nIndian, my gut instinct was to try the\ntikka masala mini-fillets first. I found\nthem greasy and not spicy enough, but\nthis was compensated by the powerful\nand moreish masala seasoning. Then I\ntried the teriyaki flavoured mini-fillets,\nwhich were sweet and juicy. Their look,\nfeel and taste was so convincing that a\nJapanese restaurant could have\nserved me this instead of\nmeat without me\nnoticing .\nT h e\nthird flavour I tried was smoky paprika,\ninspired by Spanish paella. The flavour\nbalanceofthesemini-filletswassomehow\nboth strong and delicate, both salty and\nsweet. Captivated by the unique flavour,\nI asked for a second round of smoky\npaprika fillets before ending the \u2018main\ncourse\u2019 with Radiant Foods\u2019 flagship\nproduct - Chinese five spice mini-fillets.\nIn contrast to the other three flavours, I\nenjoyed the simple taste of these mini-fillets. All five spices shone through the\nsoya, and the Chinese students present\nconfirmed that the mini-fillets tasted\nauthentic. All the mini-fillets had a\ntexturenotconvincingenoughtoreplace\nmeat, but tough and filling enough to be\na great addition to vegan curries and stir\nfries.\nHaving eaten many dry snacks by\nthis point, it was time for a drinks break\ncourtesy of\nHumaniTea. Founded by Imperial\nalumnus Tina Chen, the company makes\nMatcha and Earl Grey \u2018Tea Lattes\u2019 using\noat milk. I took a sip of the chilled Earl\nGrey \u2018Tea Latte\u2019, and my palate felt clean\nand refreshed. The Earl Grey flavour\nwas delicate yet omnipresent \u2013 a nod to\nTaiwanese bubble tea. However, some\nattendees didn\u2019t see the unique aspect of\nthe drink. It\u2019s not difficult to make tea at\nhome using oat milk and stick it in the\nfridge for a few hours.\nThe spirits of these attendees was\nsoon lifted by desserts from Wicked.\nMarketingmanagerChlo\u00e9explainedthat\nWicked have products in every category\navailable, from pizzas to seasoning.\nShe narrated the emotional story that\nfounded the company \u2013 unable to cope\nwith the death of his fianc\u00e9e, Derek\nSarno moved to a monastery and vowed\nto reduce human and animal suffering. I\nwonderediftheWickedDoubleTrouble\nChocolate Cookies were tasty enough to\nhonour Derek\u2019s legacy\u2026 and they were.\nThe cookies were less sweet than dairy\nchocolate cookies, which I especially\nliked. Despite not containing dairy\nor eggs, these cookies had the perfect\ncrumbly texture and a rich chocolate\nflavour. When I walked past Wicked\nproducts at Tesco a few days later, I had a\nnewfound appreciation for their history\nand quality.\nDuring the session, Alternative\nProtein Society treasurer Rachel said\n\u201ceveryone in alternative\nprotein has\na story\u201d. I\ncould taste\nthese stories in every bite or sip of every\nbrand that was present. It was clear from\nthe flavour profiles, textures and even\npackaging material that these companies\ncare about people and the planet.

Sustainability\nWeek Wednesday was no different. Gardeners\nplanted seeds, raked leaves, and worked on the\nmany promising projects going on at the gar-den. ESoc recently started a worm farm that\nturns food waste into compost, and are constructing raised beds to keep vegetables away\nfrom slugs and hopefully onto our plates. Most\nimportantly, beekeeping sessions will soon\nrestart, with the hope of producing honey in\n2023-24!\nYou can help out by: collecting worm-friendly\nfood waste (no citrus, no onions, no meat) and\nbringing it to the Secret Garden on Wednesdays between 2pm and 4pm.\nMock climate change conference\nEngineers Without Borders (EWB) Imperial ran a\nMock UN Climate Conference using a platform\ncalled EN-Roads, which was developed in conjunction with Ventana Systems and MIT Sloan.\nThe game allowed participants to act as UN\ndelegates representing different countries and\ndebate to try and bring down global warming to\nat least 2\u00baC or, optimally, 1.5\u00baC to comply with\nthe Paris Climate Agreement. Unlike most mock\nconferences, EN-Roads allowed the effects of\nthe actions proposed by the delegates to be seen directly. Delegates managed to bring global warming down to 1.6\u00baC, and\nin the process learnt about the\ncomplexity of climate change.\nEWB hoped delegates left feeling optimistic \u2013 it is not too late\nto take action and minimise\ndamage to our only Planet Earth.\nYou can help out by: scanning the QR code\nand joining EWB Imperial. Through their weekly events, EWB aims to inspire, educate, and\nempower students to become sustainability leaders in their fields. Events range from\nthought-provoking discussions to hands-on\ndesignathons \u2013 and include workshops such as\nthe Reshaping Engineering and Sustainability\nLeadership. They also invite expert speakers to\nshare their insights and ideas on sustainability\ntopics, and connect Imperial students to positive-impact careers\nthrough Green Career Fairs. On\n18th March, EWB will be hosting their final event of the term \u2013\n\u2018Renewable Energy Networking\u2019.\nAttend the networking session\nto discuss the future of energy\nin our society \u2013 there\u2019s plenty of\ninteresting debate and snacks to\nbe had!\nmain takeaways of the talk was: both the arctic\nmelting and the thawing of permafrost are potential tipping points for the Earth\u2019s climate\nsystem; mathematical models can be used to\nrepresent these tipping points and predict the\nfuture of the Earth\u2019s climate.\nYou can help out by: sharing stories related to\nArctic tipping points on social media.\nStudents at Environmental Society\u2019s secret garden visit,\ncredit: Simran Patel\nBackground image credit: Envato Elements\nvi\n\n"

    "content": "On 16th\nFebruary, I attended a snack\ntasting session run by Imperial\u2019s\nAlternative Protein Society. Displayed\non the tables in SAFB 122 was a tanta-lising array of plant-based meats, chees-es, and desserts. If it weren\u2019t for the\nvegan puns in the brand names, the\ngolden breadcrumb coatings and rich\nbrown chocolate would have fooled any\nmeat-eater. I couldn\u2019t wait to dig in.\nVEGAN CHEESE\nAfter handing out Jacob\u2019s cream\ncrackers, the committee distributed\nCheddar cubes made by Alt Farms. The\nSomerset-based company makes cheese\nout of oats and fava beans, so the cheese\ncontains 12% protein. Apprehensively,\nI popped one cheese cube on a cracker\nand took a bite. Immediately, my mouth\nexploded with flavour. Alt Farms have\nmanaged to find the perfect balance\nbetween being undeniably mature\nCheddar and having a unique flavour\nthat made me want more. Like any\nother mature Cheddar, the cheese was\ntoo strong on its own and the cream\ncracker diluted the flavour by just the\nright amount. The texture was similar to\ndairy Cheddar as well \u2013 when Alt Farms\nCheddar comes to a store near me, it\u2019s\ngoing straight onto my cheeseboard.\nWhile I was still recovering from the\nflavour-bomb that was Alt Farms, I was\nhanded cubes of Vegan Smoked Cheese\nand Sauvignonsense, both made by I\nAm Nut OK. As their name suggests,\nI Am Nut OK turn cashew nuts into a\ndairy substitute by fermentation and\nageing \u2013 all in their factory in Hackney.\nI Am Nut OK seemed to be mimicking\ncream cheese, because I could easily\nspread the cheese over my Jacob\u2019s\ncrackers. First I tried the Vegan Smoked\nCheese, and it tasted like a punch in\nthe face! I didn\u2019t know it was possible\nfor such a silky smooth cheese to have\nindescribable depth and complexity in\nflavour. Although the Sauvignonsense\nwas equally creamy, the taste felt like a\nlovingcaresscomparedtowhatIhadjust\ntasted. The inspiration from Cabernet\nSauvignonwasclear,fromtheredstreaks\nrunning through the cheese to the bold\nand fruity flavour. Both cheeses were\nvery popular in the room \u2013 Philadelphia\ncream cheese should be afraid.\nMAIN COURSE\nFounded in Switzerland in 2019,\nEatplanted claim their pea protein\nproducts have saved over 1 million\nchickens from ending up on our plates.\nTheir Chicken Original is perfect for\nvegan chefs wanting to use their own\nmarinades and seasoning. Biting\ninto the pieces did\nnot convince me\nthiswaschicken,\nperhaps\nbecause its texture was chewy and dry.\nMy verdict may have been different had\nthe pieces been straight out of the pan or\nserved in a meal. Most of us in the room\npreferred the more realistic texture and\nready-made deliciousness of Eatplanted\nPulled Pork Spicy Herbs. Smelling and\ntasting like a trip to Bologna, the plant-based pork had just the right level of\nherbs. Some of the 30 attendees were\nalready thinking about wrapping Pulled\nPork Spicy Herbs in a tortilla with\navocado and taking it for lunch!\nImperial Alternative Protein Society go\nnuts for cashew-based cheese\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSimran Patel Environment Editor\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n54\nEdited by: Charlotte Probstel\nNatalie Yu\nFood&Travel\nFOOD & TRAVEL\nAre vegan alternative products giving animal products a run for their money?\n\u201c\nPHILADELPHIA\nCREAM CHEESE\nSHOULD BE\nAFRAID.\n\n"

    "content": "East-Asian-inspired fashion has gained appeal in\nrecent years, with a growing number of designers\nand brands infusing east-Asian aesthetics into their\ncollections. This trend is being pushed by the expanding worldwide impact of diverse east-Asian cultures,\nnotably in the realms of entertainment and technolo-gy. McKinsey & Company\u2019s study \u2018The State of Fashion 2019\u2019 recognised Asia\u2019s expanding importance in\nthe global arena, with China and South Korea being its\ntop fashion markets.\nOne of the most prominent trends in east-Asian-inspired fashion is the revival of traditional clothes\nsuch as the Chinese cheongsam and the Japanese\nkimono. In 2019, the global market for traditional\nChinese apparel was valued at $10.8 billion, with the\ncheongsam being one of the most popular designs. The\nglobal market for kimonos and other traditional Japanese clothes is estimated to reach $40 billion by 2026.\nThe kimono has been a popular option for designers\nwith its flowing sleeves and exquisite designs, and it\nhas been reinterpreted as dresses, coats, and even beach\ncover-ups.\nThe emergence of Asian-inspired design has been\naided by the popularity of Korean pop culture,\npopularly known as K-Pop. Fans have taken notice of\nK-Popsingers\u2019boldwardrobechoices,whichhasfuelled\ndemandforsimilardesigns.K-Popstars\u2019oversizedshirts\nand jackets, vibrant designs, and bright colours have\nbecome part of the fashion standard for many young\npeople all over the world.\nFusion fashion has created its own platform by\ncombining traditional east-Asian components with\ncurrent Western design. Some renowned labels, such as\nPhillip Lim, whose collections usually showcase a blend\nof eastern and western designs, and Alexander Wang,\nwhose collections integrate elements of Chinese and\nTaiwanese culture, have adopted this trend.\nAnother company that has adopted east-Asian flair\nis Gucci. The premium label\u2019s 2018 collection featured\na variety of east-Asian-inspired features, such as dragon\nmotifs, embroidered silk coats, and traditional Chinese\nflower designs. Alessandro Michele, Gucci\u2019s creative\ndirector, noted that the collection was inspired by his\ntrips to east Asia and his interest in the region\u2019s rich\ncultural traditions.\nNot limited to the catwalk, east Asian influences\nare also gaining popularity in the streetwear scene. A\nBathing Ape (AAPE) and Visvim have gained popularity for their distinct blend of Japanese streetwear and\nAmerican hip-hop fashion, especially with young\npeople worldwide.\nThe rise in Asian-inspired fashion trends reflects\na larger cultural change in which more cultures and\ntraditions are being accepted and appreciated. It also\nrepresents a growing consumer need for something\ndistinctive and original in fashion, as they seek new\nsources of inspiration. With its rich history and\nnumerous cultural influences, Asian fashion will\nundoubtedly continue to inspire designers and\ntrend-setters worldwide.\nFRIDAY 10TH MARCH 2023\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 13\nEdited by: Gilbert Jackson\nSophie Pointon\nArts THE INNOVATION OF PRADA\nEAST ASIAN INSPIRED FASHION TRENDS\nARTS\nThe silk road to silk chic\nThefusionofEasternandWesternFashion!\nKiara Rao Arts Writer\nAn assortment of Japanese Kimonos.\nFashion Article\nYellow dress and jacket combo by Phillip Lim.\nCredit: Vogue\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nARTS NIGHT REVIEW\nDONATELLO: SCULPTING THE RENAISSANCE REVIEW\n\n"

This umbrella term\nencapsulates an endless amount of\nexperiences. Retract the umbrella, and\nyou are showered with various sub-identitiestohelpusgroundourselvesand\ncommunicate what aspec means to each\nof us personally. Demi-ace/aro, ace/aro-flux, pan/bi/homo/hetero-romantic,\nsex-repulsed, sex/romance-favourable,\nand on and on. I see sexual and romantic\nattractionasnotjustarainbowspectrum\nbut also having a colour intensity. This\nmay be a lot to absorb if it\u2019s new to you.\nLike many LGBTQ+ people, it takes\ntime to figure out our orientation,\nand even then, the nuances of it may\nfluctuate. Having the \u2018right words\u2019 and a\nsafe space to start a dialogue are critical\nvariables to realising who we are and\nlearning how to appreciate ourselves and\nothers. This sentiment is what carries\nthe recent efforts to include aspec into\nqueer conversations at Imperial and the\nbroader STEM community. That said,\nat Imperial in particular, it still feels like\nvery early days for active inclusion and\nrecognition.\nI am thankful to have been part\nof these early days, and I wish to see\nconsistent university-wide efforts for\naspec inclusion in the coming years. To\nmy knowledge, the \u2018Pride of Imperial\u2019\narticle and \u2018Pride of Exhibition Road\u2019\npanel, which I took part in during 2022,\nwere two of the first Imperial-associated\nLGBTQ+ projects that acknowledged\nthe aspec orientation. Later that year, I\nwas filled with pride to see IQ arranging\naspec focused events, specifically a panel\nfeaturing aro-ace activist Yasmin Benoit\nand \u2018the first successful\u2019 aspec student\nsocial hosted by Natalie Ng. Indeed,\n2022 was a good year to be an aspec\nstudent at Imperial.\nMeanwhile, in the external STEM\nworld, we have seen \u2018rising star\u2019 activists\ngo above and beyond to raise awareness\nandcreatesafespacesforcommunitiesto\ngrow.SarahCosgriffisanasexualscience\ncommunicator and has done incredible\nadvocacy since 2020. Along with Dr.\nJazmin Scarlett, the pair co-founded\nthe Aces in STEM network, providing a\ndigital space for people to connect with\nothers like themselves.\nSarah often incorporates queer\ntopics into their work, be it doing\nscience demonstrations that include\ndifferent pride flags or directly using\nscience as an allegory for what it is like\nto be queer. She is passionate about\nengaging LGBTQ+ audiences through\nher work, including sharing science\ndemonstrations with asexual themes on\nTikTok.Recently,shesharedoneofthese\ndemonstrations in a science context:\na science communication conference.\nThe demonstration she shared with\nconference attendees involved colour\nto describe the split-attraction model,\na model which is well-spoken across\naspec communities to describe different\nforms of attraction. She not only uses\nher expertise as a science communicator\nto engage people with science but also to\nengagescientiststoraisetheirknowledge\nof asexuality and aromanticism.\nEfforts like this give me hope that\nsomeday soon this \u2018unheard of\u2019 identity\nwill become visible and valued. From\nthe 2018 National LGBT Survey\nconducted by Government Equalities\nOffice, it was shown that asexual people\nmake up the LGBTQ+ group who are\nleast likely to be out. A staggering 89%\nof those identifying reported that they\n\u2018had avoided being open about their\nsexual orientation for fear of a negative\nreaction\u2019. The aromantic spectrum\nwas not accounted for in the survey,\nhowever, the struggle to be open is often\nexperienced by aromantic individuals as\nwell as asexuals. When asked \u2018why?\u2019, I\nbelievemanyfactorsoriginatefromwell-upheld social norms. Whether it is our\nschoolteachers in sex education telling\nus \u2018you will feel like this; you can expect\nto do that\u2019, or that one friend repeatedly\nasking, \u2018do you have a boyfriend yet\u2019. It\nall adds up to an expectation that people\nwill not understand or respect that you\nexperience things differently.\nThis is why awareness is important;\nonly when compassionate inclusion\nbecomes the norm will asexuality and\naromanticism become truly understood\nand appreciated. Imperial has started\nto play a part in generating visibility\nfor aspec students, and I hope that an\nintention to do more in the future exists.\nConsistent mindful efforts will go a long\nway in validating the aspec minority\nthat they do indeed have a place here\nin LGBTQ+ groups, Imperial and the\nexternal STEM community.

Alongside the munching on an\nassortment of sustainable snacks, the attendees explored the environmental footprint of\neveryday items like coffee cups, mobile phones,\nand jeans. Riqi Zhang, Imperial\u2019s ethics and environment officer, and Mahadi Hassan, the community engagement officer were present at the\nevent \u2013 they were keen to prompt discussions\non the environmental impacts of each stage of\na product\u2019s life cycle. Following the activity was\na discussion of solutions for reducing these environmental impacts and the role of the media\nin enacting change. Here, several constructive\npoints were made: \u201ca lot of people are conscious\n[about climate change] but maybe there is a\nlack of connection... we need more consciousness of environmental issues in the media\u201d, said\none of the attendees. Others brought up existing solutions that people could get involved in.\nSomeone mentioned that the UK produces 3.2\nbillion single-use coffee cups a year, so some\ncoffee shops have scheme where one can rent\na reusable cup. Another attendee brought up\nthe Fairphone, which is modular phone that is\nmore easily repairable and hence has a longer\nlife-time.\nSolving issues around clean water: a global\nchallenge\nThe final panel discussion of Sustainability Week focused on the health and ecological\nthreat of water pollution. Dr Stanislava Boskovic\nfrom the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering was back, this time emphasising the concept of water neutrality \u2013 offsetting\nthe impacts of increased water demand and\ndecreased water quality that often accompany\nhousing developments. Professor Tony Cass\nfrom the Department of Chemistry then brought\nup the importance of sufficient government in-vestment, university innovation and time \u2013 policy and technological change takes time \u2013 in\nreducing water shortage. It was interesting to\nhear his thoughts on how medical technology such as glucose monitoring can be applied\nto monitor pollutants like arsenic. The final\npanelist was Professor Nick Voulvoulis, the deputy head of the Centre for Environmental Policy\n\u2013 who returned to the intersectionality of water\nconservation, pollution and inequality. Following\ndiscussions were chaired by Dr Helena Rapp\nWright, whose research in the School of Public\nHealth is about monitoring levels and impacts\nof water pollutants. She raised interesting points\non the interaction between pollutants, and how\nthe impacts of metabolic or degradation products are difficult to separate.\nYou can help out by: using the dishwasher!\nContrary to popular belief, Professor Voulvoulis\nbelieves technology is more efficient at using\nwater than washing dishes manually.\n24th\nFebrurary: Water\nStudents socialising at post-workshop drinks,\ncredit: Marie Mori\nBackground image credit: Envato Elements\nx\n\n"
