    "content": "NEWS 3 October 1997\nICU Kicked in the\nBallots\nImperial College Union (1CU) is\nto begin the academic year with\nonly half the usual compliment of\nsabbatical staff. The Union currently lacks a President and a Deputy\nPresident for Finance and Services.\nLast year's president, Eric Allsop,\nhas agreed to stay on to steer ICU\nthrough a round of elections for\nthese posts, due to be held on 1 1\nNovember.\nThe sabbaticals ('s a bbs') are\nelected students chosen during the\nsecond term, who fill four posts at\nICU for the subsequent academic\nyear - those of President, Deputy\nPresident (Clubs &. Societies),\nDeputy President (Finance &.\nServices) and Felix Editor. Only the\nlatter two posts have been filled, by\nRob Clark and Jeremy Thomson\nrespectively, after student voters\nrepeatedly chose to re-run the\npresidential elections, and the\nDP(F&S) elect, Smita Chaturvedi,\nwill be unable to take her up her\npost for not being \"in good academic standing\", according to Eric\nAllsop.\nThe bizarre chain of events\nresulting in the current situation\nhas its roots in March when two\ncandidates, Sam Baker and Omar\nKier, ran for the post of president.\nBoth ran on 'joke' manifestos, and\nwhen Mr Kier withdrew, Ms Baker\nwas defeated with over 1000 students voting for 'New Election'. Mr\nClark, Mr Thomson and Ms\nChaturvedi were chosen for their\nposts in elections held concurrently.\nFresh presidential ballots\norganised in May saw three candidates standing: Oliver Newman, Ali\nHussein and Clare Bunston. Mr\nNewman, a fourth year civil engi-ne er, withdraw from the race after\nbeing offered a job. Mr Hussein\nalso withdrew, only to later try to\n\"withdraw his withdrawal\", which is\nnot permitted under election rules.\nMs Bunston, the only remaining\ncandidate, was left to be defeated\nby New Election.\nThe third round, held in June,\nhad a similar outcome in spite of\nthe perceived quality of the four\nnew candidates. The then-RCSU\npresident and favourite for the ICU\npremiership, Mo Dulloo, sensationally pulled out from the race,\nhaving also been offered employ-ment. On counting the ballot\npapers, it emerged that the vast\nmajority of students at St. Mary's had voted en masse for Paul Brown\nwithout specifying a second\nchoice; cast by single transferable\nvote, Richard Stultiens was\nknocked out first, with the remaining votes split between Laurie\nTweedale and Paul Brown.\nHowever an even larger chunk of\nthe vote was won by New Election\nand with Mr Brown's votes eliminated, \"new election won almost\nby default,\" Mr Allsop told Felix.\nNow, in a situation has not\nUnsuccessful presidential candidates (L to R, top to bottom):\nSam Baker, Omar Kier, AH\nHussein, Oily Newman, Clare\nBunston, Paul Brown, Laurie\nTweedale, Richard Sultiens, Mo\nDulloo and the new boss?\noccurred since the mid-1970s, presidential elections must be\norganised yet again, as well as\nthose for DP (C&S). Although Mr Allsop intends to\nstay on beyond his original tenure,\nhe says that he must continue with\nhis interrupted PhD of which he has\ncompleted \"two and three quarter\nyears.\" \"1 really have other things to\ndo with my life,\" he added, though\nhe stressed that he did not want to\nsee harm come to ICU. Once a candidate is voted in, he intends to\ngive them a shortened handover\nafter which he will resume his stud-ies. In spite of Sarah Corneille's absence there will be a union\nadministrator to instruct the new\nDP(C&5) incumbent. As regards\nlogistical problems with organising\nmore elections, he said that he has\n\"considerable concerns about the\nelectoral register\". A list of registered students is not normally\navailable until Christmas so screening ineligible voters would be much\nharder than usual.\nOne option would be to compile a list of students as they voted,\neffectively creating an electoral roll\nin reverse, against which any possible vote-rigging could be later\nchecked. Candidates, he added,\nshould also be aware of the kind of\nstudents who would vote in a November ballot. \"Most need to\nappreciate that the entirety of year\n1 and the majority of higher years\nwill have registered. Postgrads...\nare reluctant to go into the melee.\"\nMr Allsop, who was originally\nelected in March 1996, told Felix\nthat the election date of November\n1 I th was \"set in stone\". He went to\nsay that \"...people want a person\nthey can believe in... the pre si dent's role is quite important. The\nmeeting with the Rector isn't just\nfor show.\" With the introduction of\nthe new Charter, the ICU President\nis due to become a full member of\nthe governing body instead of\nmerely being an observer as\nbefore. Hoping for increased fresher interest in the vote, he added,\n\"These elections aren't necessarily\na bad thing... it's a unique opportunity for first years to influence\n[union politics] and could create a greater interest in ICU.\"\nPapers go up on Monday 13\nOctober, outside the Union office.\nAndy Sinharai\nNews in\nHOLE-IN-WALL\nGOES UP \\N> SMOKE\nIn mid-September, the Nat West\ncash machine in the Sherfield\nbuilding overheated and caught\nfire. The alarm was raised initially by a student when the\nmachine failed to dispense her\ncash, and soon after Ian Gillet,\nSafety Officer, spotted smoke\nrising from the screen.\nHari Nair, manager of the IC\nbranch of Nat West, was soon\non the scene. Under supervision\nfrom Ian Gillet, he opened the\ndoor to the machine room\nallowing in air at which point\nthe machine flashed into\nflames. Thick smoke hampered\nproceedings, but a Security\nOfficer was able to extinguish\nthe blaze.\nThe fire is be lived to have been\ncaused by the print head in the\nrec ip t printer overheating and\nigniting the ribbon and casing.\nThe burned parts have been\ntaken for an a yl s is by the fire\nbrigade, and the findings may\nresult in alterations to all\nmachines of the same model, of\nwhich about seventy are still in\nuse in the UK.\nThe cash survived the fire\nunharmed, and a replacement\nmachine is now in operation.\nJeremy\nMEN BEHAVING\nBADLY\nAn intruder was arrested by police\non the night of the 16th of\nSeptember after he was discovered wandering the staircases of\nthe Southside building. The man,\nwhose name is not known,\nentered Southside at about half\npast nine, slipping past the two\nsecurity guards on duty. It is\nbelieved he made his way to\nStaircase six where he attempted\nto make a girl kiss him, grabbing\nher wrist as she walked past. The\ngirl, a vacation guest at the Halls,\nknocked him away and alerted\nsecurity who called in the police.\nThey arrested the man after an\nextensive search of the building\nand found that he was wanted for\n\n"

    "content": "3 October 1997\nTHEATRE\nScapln's Tricks\nWimbledon Studio Theatre\nScapin's Tricks is Moliere's most hilarious comedy. Now\nbefore you all shake your heads in\nhorror and cry: 'French comedy!\nWhat's that?', read on. This is farce\nat its best.\nLeandro's cheeky servant,\nScapin, and Geronte's servant,\nSilvestro, have the unenviable task\nof keeping their young masters,\nOttavio and Argante, out of trouble\nwhile their fathers are away on\nbusiness. As you can imagine,\nthings do not go quite to plan.\nWhen their masters return, they\ndiscover that both young men have\nfallen in love with two Young girls.\nNaturally enough their fathers are\nnot impressed with their\nescapades, particularly as the one\nwoman is a gypsy, the other of\ndoubtful origin and both without\nmoney or connections. Geronte, an\nirascible domineering man, and\nLeandro, a penny-pinching laugh-ing-stock, want an alliance between\ntheir two houses and so they do\nARTS 21\ntheir utmost to break up their sons'\nrelationships. Ottavio and Argante\nturn to Scapin for help and here the\ntale of plots, counter plots and\nunexpected twists of fate begins.\nScapin, played by Jonathan\nAshley, brought the house down\nwith his antics. His desire not only\nThis is farce\nat it's best\nto help Ottavio and Argante and\ntheir mistresses, but at the same\ntime to line his own pockets at the\nexpense of his gullible master and\nto extract revenge on him were the\nmainstays of the play. Ashley acted\nout his part with body and soul and\nmost of the time his facial expressions conveyed more than any of\nMoliere's words could. Similarly,\nthe young men daydreamed about\nthe stage, took offense at any\nimaginary slight of their love and\nkept us all in stitches.\nI was less impressed with the\nwomen actors, who were stiff and\nwoodenly overacted their parts.\nHowever, Moliere's script did not\ngive them very much scope and\nthey have to spend most of their\ntime standing about the stage or\nbustling from one corner to the\nother.\nThe Wimbledon Studio Theatre\nis a small fringe theatre with an intimate atmosphere. I recommend\nyou go along some time even if you\nmiss Scapin's Tricks. Wherever you\nsit you are next to the stage so you\nend up far more involved in the\nplay than you would in a big West\nEnd theatre with the view obscured\nby a large pillar. The productions\nthemselves are equally good and\nmore often than not, you get to\nmeet the actors afterwards.\nEmma\nScapin's Tricks\nMoliere\nWimbledon Studio\nTheatre, 103 The\nBroadway, SW19.\nTube: Wimbledon.\nRuns Mon - Sat at\n7.30pm until\n11 October.\n\u00a37.50/\u00a34.50.\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nDon McCullin\nSleeping with Ghosts\nBarbican Centre, EC2\nTube: Barbican.\nOpens 10am Mon-Sat\nand midday Sunday.\nUntil 14 December.\n\u00a35/\u00a33 including the\nJames Ensor 1860-1949\nexhibition.\nDon McCullin\nSleeping with Ghosts\nDon McCullin (b.1935) is one\nof the world's greatest and most\nfamous photo-journalists. His\ncareer spans four decades (1959 to\n1997) and three continents\n(Europe, Africa and Asia). During\nthis time he has worked for The\nObserver, The Sunday Times and\nlately as a freelance, often risking\nhis life to capture history in the\nmaking. His work provides a social\ndocumentary and, in a way, a social\nconscience of our times, raising\nmoral and social problems which\nwould otherwise have gone largely\nunnoticed. Certain key elements\nact as ale it fade n throughout his\nwork: extreme poverty, racial\nissues, ethnic conflicts, war. The\nfirst major retrospective of Don\nMcCullin's career, this exhibition at\nthe Barbican is an absolute must\nfor anyone interested in mankind's recent history.\nFor the major part of his career,\nDon McCullin has portrayed the\nnature and the dignity of humanity\nand in contrast, man's inhumanity\ntowards fellow men. He captures\nthe pain and suffering of innocent\ncivilians caught up in conflict,\nwhether in the Congo, Nigeria and\nZimbabwe or Vietnam, Cambodia\nand Beirut. Particularly the portraits\nof young children patiently waiting\nto die from starvation will haunt me\nfor a long time to come.\nThe front-line pictures of\nAmerican Marines during the battle\nof Hue have become justly\nrenowned. It was images such as\nthese which made the American\npublic question their role in\nIt was Images such as\nthese which made the\nAmerican public question\ntheir role In Vietnam Vietnam and which created what\nsome commentators have\ndescribed as 'a permanent dent in\nthe nation's collective conscience'.\nMore than twenty years after the\nend of that war, the debate still\ncontinues. Out of all these images\nof Vietnam, one stood out. A picture of a shell-shocked US Marine.\nHis eyes stare lifeless ly out at you,\ncompletely devoid of thoughts or\nfeelings. This man has so much\nhorror he has gone beyond anything that I could describe or even\nattempt to understand.\nIn the eighties, McCullin turned\naway from the horrors of destitution and war towards landscapes\nand still life photography. This section of the exhibition brings a welcome respite from the feelings of\npity, helplessness and guilt raised\nby the rest of the exhibition.\nDramatic and beautiful scenes\nshow Nature at its best. In this\nseries, McCullin experiments with\nlight and its contrasts.\nRecently, he has returned to\nsocial documentary with a series of\nphotographs of religious festivals in\nIndia and the poverty directly related to these festivals: beggars in the\nstreets, people dying of leprosy on\nthe pavements...\nWhen you come out of this\nexhibition, you will find yourself\nquestioning the Western lifestyle\nand wondering about the state of\nits conscience. It is a truly harrowing experience.\nEmma\n\n"

    "content": "18 MUSIC 3 October 1997\nALBUMS\nTHE VERVE Urban Hymns\nThe Verve: Happy\nas ever.\nW hen the Verve disbanded after 1995's album A Northern Soul,\nthe split seemed com-ple te. There seemed no chance of\nthem re-forming and certain ll y no\nchan vce that they could make\nmuch of a comeback. This seemed\nto sadden a lot of people as The\nVerve represented, to them, the\nkind of band that were generals of\nthe army groups who produced\nsongs that ached with emotion\nwhilst maintaining hardly any\ncheesy ballad-like qualities about\nthem. They were the then kings of\n'northern' soul, something they\nthemselves obviously realised\nwhen naming their second album.\nRichard Ashcroft's voice always\nseemed to have a stern 'life should\nnot be like this and that's why 1 am\nsinging about it' air to it and Nick\nMcCabe's guitar was beautifully different every time he used it: distortion here or there; hardly loud\nenough to hear in other places etc. So why did they break-up?\nInformation on these sort of things\nis never very forthcoming from\npress and record companies, but\nthe rumours flew around. There\nwere then the rumours about what\neach band member was going to\ndo with his career afterwards\n(including ones about McCabe joining the Stone Roses after John\nSquire's hasty exit). Supposedly,\nwhat the time apart did give them\nwas time enough to decide that\nThe Verve couldn't die.\nUrban Hymns is a good a way of\ndescribing the music that The Verve\nproduce as northern soul was back\nin 1995. This is a collection of\nsongs that will burrow themselves\ninto your sub-con cio us in such a way that you will be humming the\ntunes to yourself for weeks after\nyou've heard them. The gorgeous\nstrings arrangement on the album's opener (and first single) A Bittersweet Symphony is typical of\nthe mood as well as the sound of\nthe whole album. Lyrics Ike \"It's a bittersweet symphony this life/ tr\ning to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die\" are\nbrilliant in their simplicity and dire c tion. Then there's Sonnet which\nhas the best melody of any song\nthis year. Of course, the second\nsingle from this album, the recently\nreleased The Drugs Don't Work is\nworth mentioning because of it's bare production that gives it a haunting ambience that accent aute s it's sheer beauty (sorry to\nget soppy...)\nIt's not all medium-paced rock\nanthems, though. As the album\nprogresses, the lyrics expose more\nand more of the Verve's soul and\nwhat lies underneath. They are a rock band, after all, and they\nremind everyone with tracks like\nCome On and The Rolling People\nwhich stay on the right side of\nheavy. I'm running out of space\nhere, so I 'll just tell you that you\nhave to get this album, OK? And\nno ifs or buts... Alok HM OR IS SEY Maladjusted \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nIt must have been some two\nyears ago now. We had taken\nour lives in our hands and travelled to the murky depths of Illford,\na grim little nowhere station heralded a grim little nowhere town. A perfect situation then for one Mr.\nStephen Morrissey. We had\nexpected to be surrounded by 30\nsomethings, hankering for a past\nwhen they had soothed their awkward teenage an x st at the alter of\nthe Smiths. What we got was the\nnext generation of lost souls,\nmouthing every word, not to This\nCharming Man or How soon is\nNow but to anything and everything from Morrisseys then latest\noffering Vauxhall and 1. Looking\n\"around 1 could well believe that\nthese pimple faced devotees\nweren't out of their pram s when\nThe Smiths first sang \"but Heaven\nknows I'm miserable now\" and\nthat, sorry, is the point.\nThe Union Jack and the Madness\ndebacle, Saint or Sinner? It has\nalways been easy to take the piss,\nset him up, the runt of the litter\ndestined to freeze without Marr to\nlook out for him. So where are\nyou now Johnny? Where indeed\nare all the journalists who relished\nthe demise with such open hostility? Go on admit you were wrong.\nSee, such is the fer v our that\nMorrissey can inspire. If you don't like him now, didn't like him then,\nw^ook a have been flogging their\nI indie toilet circuit for a few\nvc-ar.-i now. at a a xs j pp oars ng halfway down the bill at every fes-ti val, and have obviously acquired\na small bur devoted following.\nSpinning, their second album, is\napparently their foray into \"electrified rau nch\". And a sound move k While the 'Martha's Harbour'\nstrumming of Higher marks out\ntheir sound as fundamentally folk y, Natasha and Sharon (sharing song-writing, vocal and guitar credits)\nsoon prove they have a vicious\nbite when provoked. Mean Girl\nsounds like an out-take from PJ\nHarvey's debut album, Dry, as it\nspits and twists around a crushing\nguitar riff. Curiously, the drummer\nis Rob Ellis, who used to play with\ner.., P| Harvev. Indeed, his con tri lyrics like \"He says he is 'curious' I Says he wants to 'touch me' with\nhis finger I Claims he's got an\nitch\". This confessional style is\noften used to great effect, as on\n\"Rubber Arms\", a scream of pent-up fury about sexual frustration.\nBut it's not all trauma, as the\nBjork-ish storytelling of Higher and\nSweet Butterfly tell tales of d.

    "content": "3 October 1997 COLUMNS 9 \u00a3\nTony Blair once said that his\nproject to modernise the Labour\nParty would be finished when\npeople had learned to love Peter\nMandelson. This received a serious\nsetback last Monday, when a veteran left-winger, Ken Livingstone,\ntook the seat on Labour National\nExecutive Committee Mandelson\nso desired. Mandelson had been a prime mover behind modernisation\nunder Kinnock in the eighties,\nbecoming the MP the Hartlepool in\n1992. He has had 'the ear' of\nLabour leadership for over a decade now, with the exception of\nJohn Smith, with whom he never\ngot on. Mandelson's profile rose\nafter his election as an MP, becoming the darling of the public-relations led 'New' section of the party\nand simultaneously a figure of\ninfamy to the unreconstructed old\nleft.\nHe knows perfectly well that in\npolitics, the Rasputin never\nbecomes Czar. His ultimate goal is\na seat in the Cabinet and maybe\nthe leadership itself. This cannot be\nobtained unless he takes himself\nout of the shadows and into the\nlimelight. His formidable political\npower is invisible and his talents\nused among the 'back room' fixers.\nHis attempt at an NEC seat was to\njustify his position in the party. \"I want to be recognised by the party\nThe summer infighting with\nJohn Prescott, the Deputy Prime\nMinister over who was in charge\nwhen Blair was on holiday did\nMandleson no good. His arrogance\nin going for an NEC seat against the\nadvice of his friends came a full circle and taught him a lesson in\nHamish Common\nWestminster\nEye\nfor what I am and what I do\" he\nsaid. On the night of NEC results,\nMandelson found himself in the\nrare position of Labour MP of being\njeered at by his own party, delighted that he had been humbled, and\nby the press and news broadcast-ers, who poked fun at him in the\nsame way they poked fun at the\nConservatives a few months ago.\nhumility that rather more politicians\ncould do with. Not all is lost for the\ngood Mr Mandelson however. His\nloss with the NEC must be set within the wider context of what is happening in Labour at the moment.\nWidespread reform is still taking\nplace within the party, with its con-sent, although there are worries\nthat the Conference itself is to be\nemasculated. The worries\nare justified, since that is\nessentially what the leadership are trying to do - not destroy\nits role, but not to allow it to cause\na massive split in the party with the\nnation watching. The Government's policies must also be decided with\nthe nation rather than the\nConference shenanigans in mind.\nThe party voted these reforms\nthrough happily, with even the\ntrade unions giving them their\ngrudging consent. However the\nNEC elections still discarded\nMandelson for Livingstone whilst\nretaining the left-wingers Diane\nAbbott and Dennis Skinner. This will\nsend a message to the leadership,\nthat although they consent to\nreform and change, they will not\ntolerate the left's voice being muffled completely. Perhaps the party\nmembership is more sensible than\npeople, including its own leader-ship, give it credit for.\nmoW( ater\nRight, now that I 've finally managed to\nsqueeze myself into this lofty publication,\nI can prepare the Culinary Revolution\nwhich will change the world's eating habits\nforever. During the year I will be writing\nrecipes, tips and whatever diatribes I feel\nare appropriate. But first I must prepare\nthe subjects: you lot. So let's start with the\nbasics.\nTo make good food you need good\ningredients. This is absolutely not a problem if you're loaded, even in this country.\nAll you need to do is bomb it down to\nHarrods in your stupidly powerful flash car\nand take your pick. Or else send your PA to\npick up some just ripe papaya from wher-ever. On the other hand you may want to\nminimize your alimentary expenses so you\ncan spend your flash on something more\nliquid. In this case you'll have to make a bit\nmore effort.\nSupermarkets (may a thousand camels\nrelieve themselves in their head offices) can\nbe useful but only for stuff you can't get\nanywhere else. In particular they are rubbish for fruit and ve g and meat.\nUnfortunately if you're into fish there isn't an alternative as SM's have wiped out nearly all the independent fishmongers.\nFir For fruit, ve g and meat the answer is\nsimple: go to a street market. They have\nthe freshest produce at the cheapest prices\nand there's one in most areas of London.\nHere are some I particularly recommend:\nNorth End Road\nTube: Fulham Broadway (or walk). Open\nMon - Sat. It's enormous, it has all the\nusual produce plus an unbelievably cheap\ncheese stall.\nPortobello Road\n(The northern end, not the cheesy\nantiques bit near Notting Hill). Tube:\nLadbroke Road. Open Mon - Fri, with\norganic stuff on Thursday. More or less a pedestrian area and has some interesting\nhead shops. Plus a fantastic greasy spoon\nwith full breakfast for \u00a32.95.\nRidley Road\nTube: Dalston Junction. Open Mon - Sat.\nSmaller than the last two, it nonetheless\nhas everything you might need (including\nthe tastiest beetroot s north of the river)\nplus loads of Caribbean ve g like yams and\nplantains and the most evil chilies ever\n(handle with care and preferably a biohazard suit as well).\nII\nChurch Street\nTube: Edgware Road. Open Mon - Sat.\nNot quite as good as the others bu,t convenient if you live around there.\nBrixton\nTube: Brixton (turn right out of station,\nunder the rail bridges and right again).\nOpen Mon - Sat. Similar to Ridley Road\nbut bigger and more vibrant. A great place,\nI go there just for the atmosphere.\nAlthough most of the stalls get their\ngoods from the same wholesalers, there\nare differences in the price and quality so\nit's worthwhile checking out and comparing a load of them.\nAfter you've done the rounds of your\nfavourite market, you'll probably have a few bits and pieces still missing. For cereals and pulses and stuff like that I go to\norganic shops (because I'm like that)..\nNeal's Yard in Covent Garden is pretty\ngood and there's also a place in\nWestbourne Grove opposite the funky\nloos which I recommend. Unfortunately,\nall these places are overpriced but hey,\nsometimes you have to splash out.\nAnother favourite of mine are the\nshops in Chinatown (around Lisle St,\nSoho) where you can find a mystifying\narray of stuff from plain bean sprouts to\nweird dried things that probably shouldn't exist in this plane of reality.\nAntoine\n\" !\n:\nI "

Licence for\nthe bars and dBs.\nAfter two visits to court, a lot of\nsweaty palms, a considerable\namount of time and effort, we are\nnow happy to tell you that the\nUnion holds a full PEL, with Music\nand Dancing. Basically this means\nthat there will be regulated late\nnight bar openings on a Wednesday (until midnight) and\nFriday (lam), without any problems of licences being refused,\nwhich has happened on a number\nof occasions during the last two\nyears.\nTo the Union, this is a huge\nimprovement, and allows us to\noffer you a much more reliable\nseries of events.\nHowever, this benefit comes\nwith certain responsibilities, and\nwe can only hope to keep the\nlicence with your co-operation. The\nPolice and Licensing Authority have\nimposed certain conditions on our\nlicence, and the main ones that will\neffect you are:\nComplaints about behaviour\nand noise after an event may result\nin the license being withdrawn. So\nplease be quiet when leaving the\narea. The loss of the licence for\nyour bar and events could be lost\nfor everyone, as a result of an individual. Don't let that person be\nyou.\nCapacity for Carnivals has had\nto be reduced by 100 on the\ngrounds of Health and Safety, so\nyou'll need to get tickets even earlier !\nWe must now charge for entry,\nduring the period of any extension.\nThis means that on a Wednesday\nnight we will now have to charge\n50p after 1 1pm. But of course if\nyou get there early it's still free.\nIndividual rooms within the\nvenue now have an official capac i ty, so there is a chance that should\na room, say the Union Bar, be\ndeemed too full, a Union steward\nwill ask you to use another bar.\nThis may seem petty, but a breach\nof this fire regulation may see us\nlose our Licence.\nThe Police have re-iterated that\nwe cannot operate a \"one in one\nout\" door policy, as we are in a residential area.\nWe cannot emphasise enough\nthe importance of this Licence to\nthe Union, and the benefits to you,\nin being able to provide a safe, fun\nand value for money entertain-ment s, where the profits are reinvested in other services for you.\nPlease co-operate with us and\nhelp us to reach the high standards\nthe authorities will expect, we have\nworked hard to get this licence,\nhelp us to make the most of it.\nAbove all else though have a brilliant year.\nMark\nEvents & Marketing Manager\nEDITOR COMES\nCLEAN\nIt's Friday, term has not yet\nstarted, the college is quiet and\nrelaxed.

People cannot vote\non whether to swear all eg ien ce to a monarchy. The vote is not legal.\nI would favor a United Nations\nresolution not recognizing governments based on Monarchs and the\nuse of armed forces to bring them\ndown.\nIn America, in a place called\nBrooklyn across from Brooklyn\nTechnical high school is a mass\ngrave of twelve thousand\nAmericans tortured to death in the\ninfamous British Prison shops\nmoored in the East River. All they\nhad to do to be set free was to\nswear all eg ien ce to a monarchy.\nWhen my youngest son found\nout the English has a King he\nexplained: \"The whole country\nmust be filled with morons.\"\nYou see we believe all men are\ncreated equal, endowed by their\ncreator with certain inalienable\nrights.\nIn the American State of New\nHampshire the state motto is \"Live\nFree or Die\". I understand the\nmotto in Shropshire is \"Kiss Prince\nCharles Ass!\".\nThe United States has a constitution guaranteeing freedoms and\nestablishing the government gains\nlegitimacy from the governed and\nnot the other way around. We have\na second amendment\nGuaranteeing the right to keep and\nbear arms. Every state also has a constitution with more rights. In\nNew Hampshire the state constitution part I article IIA states: \"All\npersons have the right to keep and\nbear arms in defense of them-selves, their families, their property\nand the state.\"\nThirty seven United States have\nwhat are called \"right-to-carry\"\nlaws mandating police issue a permit to carry one or more concealed\nweapons and as much ammunition\nas they deem desire able at any\ntime of day or night.

    "content": "12 FEATURE 3 October 1997 FEATURE 13\nBizzarely-named\nchambers and\npainful ll y narrow\npassages. Tim 'Shed'\nWright reveals all.\nsub terrain e an slovenia t his summer the Caving Club\nreturned to Slovenia for the\nfourth consecutive year to\ncontinue the exploration of\nthe caves of the Migovec Plateau.\nThe cave system which we have\ndiscovered has developed from a tight and unremarkable cave into\nan impressive system containing\nhuge galleries, vertical pitches,\nstreams and chambers. The\nMigovec System, at 958m deep, is\nnow the fifth deepest and fourth\nlongest cave in Slovenia. Potentially\nthe cave could attain a depth of\n1300m which would make it the\nsecond deepest in Slovenia and\nmake it the deepest cave ever discovered by a British group.\nThe Tolminski Migovec plateau\nis at an altitude of 1800m and is\nsituated in the Triglav National Park\nin north-west Slovenia, bordering\non Italy and Austria. Exploration of\nthe caves of Migovec was first carried out between 1976 and 1981\nby the Tolmin caving club (JSPDT).\nDuring that time they found two\nsignificant caves\nwhich they called\nM2 and MI6 which were 350m and 547m deep\nrespectively. The\ncaves did not join,\nalthough their\nentrances were\nwithin 100m of\neach other. In M2\na very large 120m pitch called\n'Tolmniski Silos'\nwas found and\nalso a massive\nchamber called\n'Galactica' in\nMl6. The plateau\nhas many features\nwhich indicate\ngood cave potential; all the rain\nwater and snow\nmelt sinks immediately into the\nground and returns to the surface\ndeep in the surrounding valleys;\nthe plateau is covered with large\ndepressions and holes caused by\nwater erosion and in winter many\nholes on the surface 'breathe'\n(blow relatively warm air) which\ndemonstrates that a significant volume of air is trapped underground.\nDespite all the potential for a large\ncave system it eluded explorers for\nmany years.\nIn 1994 the caving club wrote\nto several Slovenian clubs with a view to setting up an expedition.\nWe got a reply from Andrej Fratnik\nof the JSPDT in Tolmin who gave us\npermission to explore the Migovec\nPlateau that summer. The 1994\nexpedition spent six weeks prospecting on the surface of the\nplateau and looking for promising\nleads. The most important discovery was Torn T shirt (M18) which is\nextremely tight and arduous and\nwas explored to -78m. Additionally, during the '94 exp edi tion, the deepest known cave on\nMI GOVE C SYSTEM TO LM IN, JULIAN ALPS, SLOVENIA ALT. 1830m, DEPTH 958m, LENGTH 7.2km SURVEYED TO BCRA GRADE 5b Imperial College Caving Club\nJamarska Sekcija Planinskega _J> Drushra Tolrntn 1994-97\n1\nEOT I HUA CAN GOO DN*^\n1\n0\n0\n0\nTony Hayden a bse i ling into Ml 7. Photo: Richard Anderson\nthe plateau. Ml6, was visited.\nMany of the members wrote-off\nthe area as being unpromising, i Some however, had been in Torn\nT shirt during a violent storm and\nhad heard the roar of a stream\nbeyond the squeeze. They felt sure\nthat there were significant discoveries to be made if only we could\nforce a way through this obstacle.\nIn '95 we came prepared with\ncrowbars, hammers, chisels and a cast iron will, in Torn T shirt we got\nthrough the squeeze which defeated us the per vio us year\n(Optimisqueeze) only to find it lead\nimmediately to a second squeeze\n(Turtle's Head squeeze). We hammered our way through and eventually got to a30m pitch. We were\nsoon squashed into several even\ntighter passages. The absolute\nworst was the Nutcracker squeeze\nwhich is so tight that you have to\nremove your harness to squeeze\nthrough. All this work meant we\nhad less than two weeks to explore\nthe newly discovered NCB\npassage. The most\nimportant leads w pre a massive free hanging pitch and a small crawl from the roof of the passage. The big pitch was\nnamed Godzilla. Every attempt to bottom it was unsuccessful\u2014it took a rock 4.5 seconds to hit the ground, and from\nthe bottom of 90m ol' rope it was thought that the bottom\nwas still 20m30m down. \"Had difficulty in threading\ndescender at the top of new pitch. Went down to first knot\nand, in the midst of nothingness, spent 10 mins. trying to\nwork out how to pass it...kind of scary! Slowly down to second knot, the rope hanging closer to the wall. Top of rope\nwell out of sight and no sign of the floor. Worried now. Down\nto end of rope, slowly, very slowly. Tied on the last rope and\nwent down doing my best not to bounce around (as there\nwas a bit of a rub point higher up). Nowhere near floor at end\nof rope...! reckon another 20m. Thought I could see two possible ways on at the bottom. Ascend slowly finding it a bit of\nan ordeal -my whole life resting on four bits of stretched rope\nand a bolt put in by CV Pete!\" (diary entry). We had to wait\nfor next year's expedition to explore further.\nMorale was very high in '96. An underground camp was\nset up in NCB passage. We were fortunate enough to be lent\na laptop computer by Hewlett Packard, which allowed us display the map of the cave while we were on top of the mountain and visualise its progression. The first camping trip was\nto bottom Godzilla, a team of three went down with plenty\nof rope. One member of the team\nwas the Slovenian cave r Andrej\nFratnik. When the bottom was\nreached the growing fear that this\nwas actually part of the cave M2 was confirmed. Adrej found a plum\nstone at the bottom which he had\ndropped the last time he was down\nthere in 1979.\nThe next trip concentrated on\nexploring The Void. Adrenaline was\nhigh, the pitch seemed to be about\n40m deep. Eventually we got to the\ntop of a large pitch. We had found\nLevel 2, a chamber about 25m high\nand 30m in diameter. It has two\npitches in it: Arian 5 (about 30m), Divine Brown (about 10m).A large\npassage also went off in a northern\nand southern direction. When the\ncave survey was plotted using the\ncomputer we noticed that the new\npassages were within 20m of M16\n(the other cave explored by the\nSlovenians). A lot of effort was put\ninto trying to find a connection with\nM16 and eventually this effort paid\noff. We had laid the foundations for\naccess to the lower parts of the\nsystem.\nArriving in Tolmin this year, we\nwent to the pizza cafe for the usual\nfinal taste of beer and real meat.\nWe met Andrej and Simon, two of\nthe Slovenians, who told us that\nthe cave was now 700m deep not\n281m as we expected. In 1996 we\nhad found a way off to a50m pitch\nat the end of Exhibition Road\n(which we called Bikini Carwash).\nUnfortunately we had not enough\ntime to go down it. The Slovenians\nhad pushed down this pitch\n(named XXX) and found another\neven bigger 75m pitch 'Sajeta'. At\nthe bottom of this was a stream.\nThis was the first time a stream had\nbeen found in the cave. There are\nother wet sections, but they were\nonly seepage of water through the\nrock. This stream had been followed down to -700m where the\nway on got too dangerous. The\nwater disappeared through a small\nhole, and in a storm it may sump.\nHowever they were not discouraged\u2014they had explosives to make\nthe hole bigger!\nAt -800m the caves split into\ntwo ways, one wet, one dry. The\nfirst way to be explored was the dry\nway. On Monday 4th August a team returned from camp to the\nsurface. Every one was waiting for\nthe news. Unfortunately that part\nof the cave only reached 958m deep, this section was named\n'Good not Grand' as it didn't make\nthe kilometre. At the bottom was a static sump. This led to discussion\nof whether it was the limit of depth.\nIt is generally considered that it\nisn't. Predicting what the cave will\ndo was a hot topic of discussion.\nOur hopes hadn't faded as\nthere was still the wet way to push.\nThis Way although wet was not too\nwet. Then we hit FA999, the name\ngives an indication of what this\npitch was like. It was a40m wet\npitch, unfortunately the stream\nbreaks up and fills the whole pitch\nwith spray. The water temperature\nis about 1\u00b0C. It took two camping\ntrips to bottom the pitch. We were\n910m deep and the water disappeared through a crawl which we\ncould fit through, but you had to\nget very wet to do so. Additionally,\nwe were unsure how quickly the\nstream reacted to heavy rain\nstorms, a pulse flood in such an\narea would very dangerous. On\nFA999 there was no room for mis-takes. We decided that at this\nstage we should look elsewhere for\nleads. Again the 1 km had escaped\nour reach.\nWhat we had found in previous\nyears happened again\u2014some of\nthe best leads were made fairly\nclose to the end of the expedition,\nleaving a number of exciting leads\nfor next year. The Slovenian cavers\nno doubt will be doing some exploration in the cave. The cave has\ndeveloped from a small shaft series\nto a world class system that is\nSlovenia's most important recent\ndiscovery. There has been a one\nhour program on radio Slovenia\ndiscussing the exploration of the\nsystem. It was also one the highlights in the recent British caving\nconference and the deepest discovery by a long way! It has been a privilege to explore in this area.\nIf you think you want a piece of\nthis action then why not try caving?\nWe will have a stall at the Freshers\nFair. You never know, you could\nsoon be exploring system Migovec,\n1 km under the ground and making\nhistory...\nSlide show Thursday 9th October at\n7pm( venue to be announced)\nE mail: tj w3@ doc.ic.ac.uk\nJames Hooper at the entrance to\nM16.\nPhoto: Mark Evans\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 3 October 1997\nLondon Fashion week\nbrings new style to IC\nThe Queen's Lawn played host to a myriad of\nstars from the fashion world this week as the hip\nand trendy congregated in South Kensington for\nLondon Fashion Week. Of those designers exhibiting their wears, many did so within the confines of\nImperial College, and so, no sooner had the\nexamination tents been dismantled, than new and\nmore extravagant models were erected to house\nthe collections of some of the most innovative\nBritish designers.\nDesigners as diverse as John Rocher and\nAlexander McQueen were seen to peruse the IC\nconcourse and a gaggle of incredibly skinny girls\nalso found their way to the Queen's Lawn.\nHowever, actually managing to obtain tickets to\nthe highly popular catwalk shows proved a hopeless task for many people.\nI was lucky enough to attend the exhibition of\nJ.&. M. Davison. The collection was aimed at the\nminimalist in all of us, with the emphasis firmly on\ntexture and tailoring. Initially, Pastel colours were\nteamed with cool creams to provide a somewhat\nethereal atmosphere as scruffy haired models\nparaded down the catwalk. Stylish creations in\nblack, brown and navy provided 'the classics' with\nthe boost they have been hankering for for a long\ntime. The most unusual colour combinations,\nhowever came towards the end of the show,\nwhen turquoise b roid re anglais was worn with\nvibrant cerise lycra, a partnership which served to\nenhance the already childlike qualities of the pre-pubescent looking models.\nSilk knits coupled with Chinese silk or with\nembroidered chiffon layered over satin, later\nadded that currently popular oriental feel. Skirts\nwere slinky, loosely figure hugging and knee\nlength, while dresses skimmed the bottom and\ntrousers hung loosely from the hips. The 'big\nknickers' which have become a feature in many\ncollections during the last six months also reared\ntheir, some would say, ugly head here, this time\nvaguely camouflaged under tiny translucent\nSeventies smock dresses.\nThe make up remained simple throughout the\nshow, so as not to up stage what the press and\npublic had really come to see, with the current\ntrend for glowing cheeks and sun-kissed skin\nmeticulously adhered to.\nOver all the show was deemed a success by\nall and nothing but praise was heard for the husband and wife design team.\nKelly Robinson\nWater-halls\nfrom front page\nwith the situation in a \"well-organised fashion\" despite the danger involved due to live wires and\ncables. Although power had been\nshut off to the levels affected, the\nextent to which the water had\nspread was not realised until later\nwhen a shower room was inspected for water damage and the\nflour e scent light was found to be\nflickering on and off. Pipes and circuitry that ran through the walls\nwere heating up and cold water\ncame out boiling due to heat dissipation from power lines. Room\n681 had power cut to it completely after shift engineers inspected it\nand found the wires in the light\nswitch had almost burnt through\ndue to a probable short-circuit and\ncould have caused a serious fire.\nThe engineers also found a battery\nroom flooded and were met by a \"wall of water\" when they opened\nthe door.\nSouthside Bar was closed and\ncordoned off for several days and a large amount of repairs had to be\ncompleted before it opened again.\nThe lounge above the bar was\nclosed for longer as there were\nworries about the amount of water\nthe building had absorbed from the\npipe - a cro props were put into\nplace to support the ceiling beams\nand pillars of the lounge. Most of\nthe wood in the building that\nabsorbed water warped and\nswelled, in some cases so much\nthat doors were not able to open or\nclose properly at all.\nA cleaner informed us that the\ncarpets took at least a week to dry\nout even when they used vacuum\ncleaners designed to suck up water\nand had to resort to using blankets\nand sheets from beds.\nAnother small flood occurred\non the 25th of September to a different pipe on Southside, a hot\nwater supply pipe, but it was controlled and cleared up within min-ute s.

The water flowed from the\npipe at an estimated gallon a second and ran across the roof\ntoward the other side of the build-ing, leaking down into the floors\nbelow as it went. Engineers were\nforced to drain the water tank that\nsupplied the pipe, shutting off the\nmains supply first and then turning\non all the taps and showers in the\nbuilding waiting almost an hour for\nit to empty. The water managed to\nreach ground level in about forty-five minutes, passing through the\nwardrobes and door frames that\nrun from floor ro c eling in each\nroom. Most staircases were dam-aged, the rooms on Staircases Six,\nSeven and Eight being the worst\naffected. The top levels of those\nstaircases were completely flooded and around a hundred and fifty\npeople had to be evacuated to\nBeit, Weeks and Linstead Halls\nwith some damage to their prop-er ty. It is unknown whether the\nImperial College insurance policy\ncovers this kind of accident.\nAs the event occured on a Sunday night, no senior staff were\navailable to supervise an evacuation of around eighty people from\ntheir swamped rooms, but reception staff and the Linstead house-keeper, Sheena McDonagh, dealt\ncontinued on page 4\nincluding their insurance which\ncovers them against vets bills and\nany action that may be brought due\nto the dogs' behaviour.

    "content": "14 FILM\nNow showing in Local Cinemas\n3 October 1997\nWe take a look at some of the\nfilms currently in the cinema that\nyou may have missed over the\nsummer...\nMy Best Friend's Wedding\nStarring: Julia Roberts, Dermot\nMulroney, Cameron Diaz\nDirector: P] Hogan\nThe most successful romantic\ncomedy ever is an odd one.\nRoberts plays Jools, a vicious food\ncritic who has been the best friend\nof Michael (Mulroney) for eight\nyears. On hearing of his impending\nmarriage to the young, beautiful\nKimmy (Diaz) she realises that she\nfeels more than just friendship for\nhim and so sets out to ruin the\nwedding by any means necessary.\nThis clearly isn't the sort of\nactivity that romantic comedy leads\nusually get up to. But, as many\nreviewers of this film seem not to\nhave noticed, we're not expected\nto root for Jools. When she humiliates Kimmy in a karaoke bar it is\nthe naive girlfriend we feel for, not\nthe manipulative \"best friend\". So\nthis strange plot doesn't put us off\nsome truly hilarious sequences,\nusually centred around Rupert\nEverett playing a gay friend of Jools.\nHe's drafted in to pretend to be her\nfiancee in an attempt to make\nMichael jealous, but is too camp to\nbe convincing and is uncomfortable\nwith the deception. Everett steals\nevery scene he's in with a combination of great lines and quality physical comedy.\nIn fact, all the actors are\nimpressive, except the slightly dull\nMulroney who doesn't seem the\nsort of guy that women would fight\nover. However, what sets this film\napart from so many others in this\ngenre is that rarest of attributes: an\nunpredictable ending.\nAir Force One\nStarring: Harrison Ford, Gary\nOldman, Glenn Close\nDirector: Wolfgang Petersen\nHarrison Ford was born to be\nthe US president, so playing him is\nprobably good practice. He\ncertainly starts off well, giving a publicity grabbing speech saying\nthat he will never succumb to terrorist threats. These honourable\nmotives soon become tested to the\nlimit, however, as Air Force One is\nhijacked by terrorists demanding\nthe release of a Russian revolutionary leader. The President and his\nfamily are on board at the time and\nthis action thriller sees Ford sneaking around the plane trying to save\nthe hostages.\nAs far as films of this type go,\nthis is excellent stuff. Breathtaking\nvisuals and sound combine with\nFord's usual stylish hero to make\nthis the best action film of the\nsummer.\n\"Okay, okay, I'm sorry. You did\nlook great in The Full Monty\"\nStarring: Robert Carlyle, Ray\nWinstone, Steven Waddington\nDirector: Antonia Bird\nAnother heist-goes-wrong film,\nthis time set in the heart of gangster London. Five robbers fall out\nafter discovering they've only\nnicked a fraction of the two million\nquid they were expecting. Honesty\namong thieves is soon discarded as\none of them helps himself to the\nbooty and so the villains start fighting amongst themselves.\nQuality acting and some\ninspired directing make this a superior thriller.\nThe Full Monty\nStarring: Robert Carlyle, Tom\nWilkinson, Mark Addy\nDirector: Peter Cattaneo\nHaven't seen it actually. But,\nabsolutely everybody who has says\nit's \"bloody amazing\". Six unemployed men try their luck at\nstripping in their local club. And\nthat's about it, but apparently it's insanely hilarious so go and see it.\nCALLING ALL\nBUDDING FILM\nREVIEWERS\nFelix needs rs. Dall the be\nany oi Barry Norm; cinemas wit drink? If so i for you. Co Men In Black\nStarring: Will Smith, TommyLee Jones, Linda Fiorentino\nDirector: Barry Sonnenfold\nIf you haven't heard of this then\nyou're probably one of the aliens\nthat feature in it. The brilliant Smith\ncombines with the ultra-cool Jones\nto protect humanity from the\nextraterrestrial vermin that infests\nour planet. Together they are the\nMen In Black, stopping illegal immigrants eating humans and driving\ntaxis.\nThe two leads work together\nperfectly and the special effects are\ngreat - the only problem with this\nexcellent film is that it's too short.\nnew team of Fresher' s Fair stand for more ng next to Fil\nin all the best th Free <e Pe,\ni this is the job Face/Off, 1\nafon q to our Alien 4 and Titanic.\n\u00bbpinto the Felix ly lunchtimes.

    "content": "MUSIC\n3 October 1997\nI know what you're thinking. \"At\nlast, the music pages!!\" Well, yes,\nthe following pages of reviews are\nby a crack commando squad of\nhighly-qualified reviewers who live,\nbreathe, eat and sleep music.\nTheir only intention in life is to\nbring their opinion of the latest\nreleases to you so you have something interesting to read in lectures\non a Friday morning.\nThis week, as well as all the usual\nalbums and singles, we have part\none of a summer albums round-up. This will give you a guide to\nthe best albums released over the\npast few months and is truly indispensable. Every week, we will endeavour to\nbring you reviews of everything\nfrom pop to drum 'n bass, from\nhip-hop to dance. As well as the\nreviews, there is the news column\n(which you are currently reading)\nwhich will tell you all the latest\nnews and gossip from the glitzy\nmusic world. If there's anything\nyou want to know about your\nfavourite artist (or indeed anyone)\nthen write in and ask - this is where\nyou get your answers.\nThere will also be countless competitions over the next 30-odd\nissues, including ones next week\nfor Alanis Morrissette, Tori Amos\nand Fleetwood Mac videos, so\nkeep tuned in.\nALBUMS\nDUB STAR Goodbye \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nSarah contemplates modelling\nfor Cossard.\nTHE SUNDAYS Static & Silence * \u2022 '/2\nLike rabbits, Dubstar\nare frozen in the headlights of an approaching second album.\nLoaded down with tons of glowing\ncopy about Disgraceful, the album\nthunders toward them, about to\ncrush them like... well, like roadkill.\nCan they break free from the fixating beams? Can they produce the\nfollow up to what was in my (and\nmany other's) opinion, the finest\nalbum of '96?\nAlthough not as instantly access i ble, Dubstar haven't eschewed the\nlush melodies and poignant,\nSmithsian lyrics of their stunning\ndebut. Rather, they have expanded\ntheir sound to encompass a much\nwider range of influences. Just listen to the Red Snapper oboe loop\non Inside, and the minimalist, icy\nbeauty of Polestar for evidence.\nAnd always at the heart of these\nsongs are minor key melodies,\nbrought into sharp relief by Sarah's melancholic delivery. On No More\nTalk, a plea for an end to the endless dissection of a floundering\nrelationship, or When you Say\nGoodbye, where the acid tang of\nparanoia creeps through the drunken last dance, suspicion and jealousy leading to some serious fang-baring - \"To get my revenge I wanted to spike her 1 And laugh in her\nface when she's tripping with fear\".\nJesus, you twisted bitch! But if it's blatant pop thrills you're after,\nthere's still enough to keep you\nhappy. / Will be your Girlfriend has\nsuch a triumphant little guitar riff it\ndistracts you from the fact that the\ntitle lyric is no flirtation - it's a threat. The suffocating stench of\nsmall-town life is smelt on The\nView from Here, and sounds like Abba's The Day Before you Came.\nYes, it's that good. Sadly, Goodbye\nloses my attention in the more\nstring-laden, produced, tracks such\nas It's Over or Ghost, which is wor-ry ingly close to lift mu zak. But the\nfinal track, Let's Go, restores my\nfaith, so brimming with defeat and\nresignation that as it fades out you\ncan believe their hearts fade with it,\nstilled by the sheer scale of the\nache within.\nBack on the road, Disgraceful roars\npast. Dubstar blink and realise that\nwhilst making a worthy successor,\nthey've survived. Norm H Think You Can Do Better?\nFinally, don't forget to get\ninvolved. If you want to get free\ntickets to gigs, get free music and\nother free stuff, and you can write\ncoherently (or even if you can't!) then we would love to meet you.\nCome to the Felix stall in Freshers\nFair in Beit Quad and sign up. Ther\nwill be loads of give-aways as well\nat the stall so it's definitely worth a visit! Also check out the article on\nthe far right.\nAnd now, the marking scheme...\nAll reviews are given stars up to a maximum of five. The ratings are\nas follows:\nColumbia Supreme\nir-kit -k Mocha Java\n* + * French Roast\n\u2022* * Kenco\n* Nescafe\nNo Stars De-caff\nD avid Gavurin. and Harriet\nWheeler probably get sick of\nhearing these words - fluffy,\ncuddly, lovely, cosy warm and snug.\nThing is, if you're going to make\nsongs that revel in emoting these\nwords, what other ways have we to\nconsider them? These are songs of\npeople so obviously in love that\nalone, one is almost excluded.\nAccess only available to couples in\nthe final stages of extreme so ppi ness. No cynics allowed.\nThe Sundays seem to have lost the\npop-driven sounds of their essential debut album, Reading, Writing\nand Arithmetic, in favour of more\nfolk y, adult, songs. The single\nSummertime is the probably the\nonly exuberant of all the songs\nhere, and still only in stoned,\nSunday afternoon kind of way. As\nthe devotional When I'm Thinking\nAbout You comes along, Harriet\nand David seem more like the\nhippy-drip py couple crooning to\neach other in the Healing Fields at\nGlastonbury, totally absorbed by\ntheir mutual love. Which is fair\nenough, but at least spare a moments thought for your rapidly\ndecreasing audience.\nHarsh criticism aside (thank god, it\nfeels like stoning squirrels), the\nalbum crawls towards redemption\nwith the inclusion of some fantastic\nsongs. She waltzes along like the\nbest song All About Eve never\nwrote, all flushed cheeks and\nun self conscious joy. But it's been a long seven years since 1990, and\nwhile The Sundays have matured\nthe pop world has become increasingly obsessed with instant thrills.\nAlthough Cry is undoubtedly a well-crafted song, lyrics like \"I'm standing on the plato rm, staring from a train I the trees roll back really\nmakes me cry\" are indicative of the\nretrospective feel to much of this\nalbum.\nOf course, my Mum thinks it's tops, and reckons it'll look really\nnice next to her Elton John CDs.\nNorm H If, after reading these next few\npages, you're thinking to your-self, \"I could do that\", then make\nyour way over to the Felix office\nin the north-west corner of Beit\nQuad.\nIf you pass the stringent mental\nand physical tests, we will send\nyou on a three month training\ncourse to Brazil, where you will\nlearn the finer arts of music jour-nal is m. You will learn how to\nwrite the perfect album review\n(200-300 words) as well as how\nto get them in on time. You will\nbe given countless singles to take\nback home and you will have to\ncast your critical eye over them\nfor the benefit of your fellow\nImperial students. You will also\nbe made to in te view and review\ngigs of bands of whom you\nwould sell your granny to meet.\nForget the army, this is what it's all about. Come to the Felix\noffice on fridays at 1.30pm to\nfind out more, or visit us at the\nfresher's fair. H "

An album full of some of the most laid-back\ncool in the world appears under the name of Maverick\nA Strike by Finley Quaye. Here is a man with a curios ly inters sting voice; he sounds like a ninety-year old\ncrone that's just swallowed a whole cann is ter of\nHelium but he fits in over the hypnotic reggae-influenced music quite nicely. The classic cut here has to\nbe Sunday Shining (the one co-written with Marley) in\nwhich the simplest of riffs catches your immediate\nattention. There are the more sample-driven and\ndance-y tracks too like Supreme I Preme which has a hard (yet still very cool) back beat coupled with some\nstrange effect on the vocals.\nEven After Ail gets back to the whole man-with-a strange-voice-but-nice-melody thing with aplomb and\nthen there's Red Rolled And Seen, a track with a very\nfunky outro. Falling brings in a quieter element to the\nproceedings with its simple bassline and vocals which\nis punctuated momentarily with swathes of strings.\nA fine album and one deserving all of its recent credit\nin the press. Alok HCD ROM D Code...\nContains music tracks from\nLionrock, Republica and others, a large quiz and a graphical music\nprogram, intended to let you write\nsimilar music. You can't access this\n'Arcade of Sound' until you've got\nall the questions in the quiz cor-rect. This is because the disk was\nreleased by the National Drugs\nHelpline, and they want you to find\nout all about the dangers of drugs.\nThe graphics are truly stunning\n- obviously a huge amount of work\nhas gone into its chaotic, MTVstyle presentation. There is always\nsomething moving, silly games to\nkeep you amused and even the\n'right-on' D) voiceover, which\nwould normally be irritating, is\namusing for its surreal comments.\nThis is a good job, as the questions are predictably facile and\nthere's an awful lot of them. It also\nrequires you to run your monitor in\n256 colour mode. Jeremy\nPick up your free copy of D Code\nat the Felix Office LTS Portishead - All Mine\nTruly terrifying stuff. You'll be shocked to learn\nthat All Mine is straight out of a Sixties spy\nthriller, Beth Gibbons playing the siren luring you\nonto the rocks of a bourbon and ice, before\nbeing drowned by your sorrows. Cowboys, previously limited to a5000 copy release, is also\nincluded here and sounds like an 'alien se duc tion' scene from Star Trek (can you imagine\nBeth with green skin?) - it's trip-hop Jim, but not\nas we know it.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Prolapse - Autocade\nThe Best Live Band in Britain are back with this\nsingle from their new album, The Italian Flag. In\na bid for populist appeal, they've dropped their\ntrademark edginess for an early Lush sound, and\ncreated a gorgeous, rushing anthem to the spirit of '92. Which is fine if you like that kind of\nthing. It's quite a relief that we also get a decent\nargument between Mick and Linda (Testation)\nand some 'Lab-ish meandering s( Pro-Loop) to\nshow they haven't really gone all fluffy on us.\nU2 - Popheart Live EP\nFour tracks recorded in Rotterdam and\nFdmonton, led by Please, over seven minutes of\ncut-up ramblings from Bono that is dull with a capital DUH. Trading on past glories (Wriere the\nStreets have no Name, With or Without You)\ndoes them no favours either. Great songs, sure,\nbut we've heard them before.\nThe Sundays - Summertime\nA fine tune for a sunny, love-filled day. Sadly, my\npersonal life sucks and the weather's turned\nright nasty, so it loses most of it's appeal.\nBelle and Sebastian - Lazy Line Painter fane\nAlmost everything about Belle and Sebastian is\nbrilliant. The themes of the songs, from empty\nlives in grey, industrial unemployment capitals,\nto dreams of escape, freedom and sexual\nambivalence. The music, both gentle guitar and\ninsistent Wurlitzer fighting for control. The feeling that Dusty Springfield would have killed for\nthese songs thirty years ago. And for these\nthings I love Belle and Sebastian. But the voices\nan over-excited Eddi Reader, and a terminally\nuncertain Ricky Ross, his voice quavering as\nanother harmony is missed. Many have argued\nthis is part of their charm. Having seen them\nsupporting Tindersticks last year, I promise you\nthat this is part of the reason they are crap\nChina Drum - Somewhere \u00a3/se\nWhere once there was punk fuelled energy,\nthere is now bog-standard rock. Where they had\nHusker Du inspired melodies, rubbed red raw\nwith passion, there is now a bland wash of overproduced sound. They've got the new album\n(Self-Made Maniac) to convince me they still\nmatter, then I'm giving up.\nWarm Jets - Hurricane EP\nIt's terribly dangerous to hail a band as 'the\nnew Pixies' t's just too much to live up to, and\nthey'll more than likely end up bein crap ut\nlet's consider the facts. Behemoth bass lines.\nPop thrills galore, without the loss of a wilful sense of experimental ism.A tremendously cool\nlead guitarist (who looks and sounds like joey\nSantiago). Songs that make my heart soar, my\nface flush and my feet twitch, something only\never achieved by a) a lethal cocktail of drink\nand drugs, or b) The Pixies.

Security was alerted and\ntwo guards chased the peeping\ntorn out of the centre. In the\nensuing struggle, the man tripped\nand fell, breaking his arm and\nelbow.\nPhyz\nBIG MAC, BIG\nDEAL\nThis autumn saw the launch of a new deal jointly by MacDonald' s and the National Union of Students. Under the scheme, students are entitled to a free\nHamburger or Cheeseburger on purchase of an Extra Value Meal. Over 1.6 million students across the country are expected to benefit from the deal. To take up the offer, students must present a valid NUS card and MacDonald' s own Student Privilege Card at the counter. The latter would be issued in conjunction with theN US card at Fresher's Fairs. However, stu dents from non NUS affiliated\ninstitutions, such as Imperial College, are not eligible to apply\nfor the Privilege Card. Most of MacDonald' s restaurants around the country already provide special offers to students from their local universities, and the latest move by\nthe company is their first attempt to run such promotions at a national level. When asked if the scheme would be extended to cover students from IC, Mr Lloyd Evans, manager of the Knightsbridge branch, replied that he would be happy to make similar offers to them. Them a tter is currently being considered by the Imperial College Union and the marketing board of MacDonald' s. Kent Yip\nBeef-eaters beware\nIn Nature published yesterday\n(Volume 389), Professor John\nCollinge and co-workers from the\nprion disease group based at St\nMary's Hospital provide further evidence that the new variant\nCreutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vC JD), which has so far claimed 21 lives in\nthis country, is caused by the consumption of BSE contaminated\nbeef.\nIt has previously been argued\nthat BSE and vC JD are brought\nabout by different strains of prion,\nthe infectious agent responsible for\na range of transmissible neuro-degenerative diseases, such as\nscrap ie and kuru, by converting the\nnormal form of the protein present\nin the brain into its pathogenic var i ant, which accumulate and lead to\ndamages to the central nervous\nsystem. Results from earlier experiments suggest that a \"species bar-rie r\" may exist between human and\ncow, which rules out effective conversion of normal human prion into\nits pathogenic strain by the bovine\nprion.\nHowever, outcomes from the\nlatest series of experiments in\nwhich mice were inoculated with\nBSE and vC JD prion have convinced\nscientists that the two types of\nprion are one and the same agent.\nMice which contracted BSE and\nvC JD showed striking similarities in\nthe prion deposition pattern in\ntheir brains. Biochemical analyses\nhave also identified the pathogenic\nprion generated as a result of\nexposure to vC JD and BSE to be the\nsame.\nThe conclusion of the paper is\nthat these data provide compelling\nevidence that BSE and vC JD are\ncaused by the same prion strain,\nand vC JD is indeed caused by BSE\nexposure. The theoretical possibility that both BSE and CJD arise from\nexposure to a common unidentified source has also been strongly\nruled out.\nKent Yip\nIC Security goes to\nthe Dogs\nfrom front page\nthe sports center. They have\nalso helped in some \"incidents\" at\nWilson House and with another\nintruder at Evelyn Gardens during\nthe holidays.

Editorial\nHello, Hello, Hello\nGreetings all new and returning\nstudents (and those unfortunate\nenough to be here all summer). For\nthose who don't know, Felix is IC's free students' newspaper. It's written and produced entirely by students and is funded partly by\nImperial College Union and partly\nby advertising income. Unusually,\nthough, we have editorial freedom\nfrom ICU so that we can print what\nwe like (so long as it is legal).\nIf you picked up this copy from\nyour hall, I'm afraid that's a novel-ty. Felix usually appears in piles in\nthe larger departments on Friday\nmornings. We like to do our bit for\nyour academic standing by giving\nyou a reason to vacate your warm\nden on a Friday morning.\nHeadless Chickens, and Other\nCreatures\nICU currently lacks a President\nand a Deputy President for Clubs\nand Societies. While the lack of DP\nC&S is unfortunate, the missing\nPresident is a sorry indicator of the\nindifferent attitude common at\nImperial College. Granted, turnout\nrose considerably over last year,\nbut it still represented less than a quarter of those eligible to vote.\nAfter ejecting the first two rounds\nof candidates, the electorate\nseemed to gain a nihilistic bent to\nprevent even the most competent\nhopeful from succeeding. Block\nvoting tactics at the St. Mary's campus were also to blame,\nthough perhaps this was due in a larger part to poor planning than\nvindictiveness. With the aim of\nthrowing more weight behind their\nvotes, they have inadvertently put\nall students at a disadvantage.\nNew elections are set for 1 I November, and I sincerely hope\ntheir are taken in the correct spirit;\ngreat fun, but extremely important.\nThursday Evening, 7pm On Monday, 1 was app re hen sive, but confident. By Tuesday\nlunchtime, a certain feeling of\ndread had set in. Wednesday was\ngrim, but quiet. Where were all my\ncontributors? What had happened\nto the articles that I had been faithfully promised? I slogged through\nto lam, which I know is not particularly late, once again cursing my\nunfounded faith in people and my\nfoolish belief that they will do what\nthey say, when they say. Not that\nI'm any better myself.\nBut now it's Thursday evening,\nand already I 've broken my un writ ten, personal vow not to keep the\nprinters here after hours. And still\nthe arts page is blank.\nSo the symbolic first issue is\ncompleted (almost). It's good, but\nit's far from brilliant. As an album, it\nwould get two-and-a half stars,\nmaybe three. I hope you like it\nmore than I do. And if you think\nyou could do better, you know\nwhere to come...\nJeremy Thomson\nSmall Ads lE&O Rollerblades for sale. Bauer X90\nsize 9, little used. \u00a335.
