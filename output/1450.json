Perhaps rekindling the spirit\nDury could even be deemed a glamour\nrole for Serkis after Gollum?\nDirector Mat Whitecross weaves\ntogether a colourful, raucous, moving\naccount of Ian Dury, both as the east\nend wordsmith who\u2019s witty, frequently\ncrude but always razor-sharp rhyming\nis still revered to this very day, but also\npoignantly capturing the difficulties\nDury encountered as a child branded\ndisabled. Polio ravaged his left arm and\nleg when swimming in his early school\ndays and Whitecross tactfully fuses the\ntrauma of this event and Dury\u2019s subsequent horrific early experiences in an\ninstitute for disabled children, along\nwith incredibly powerful insights into\nDury\u2019s relationships with his family\nand lovers to his unrelenting desire to\nsucceed as an entertainer.\nThe film contains strong family input into conveying exactly how spiteful a bastard Dury really was, the end\nresult leading son Baxter Dury to proclaim that he \u2018bled internally\u2019 upon\nviewing Serkis bringing back the ghost\nof his father, whilst some members of\nthe family feel the film does not go far\nnot enough to expose his grotesque-ness. Pitching Dury in the most objective light is a tough task, despite being\na notoriously difficult man when intoxicated his charm, humour and in-Director Malcolm Venville\nScreenwriter Louis Mellis\nCast Ray Winstone, John Hurt\nRunning Time 95 mins\n44 Inch Chest\nFrom the writers of Sexy Beast (2000),\n44 Inch Chest gains cult status for a different approach to a British gangster\nmovie. Ray Winstone plays Colin, a\nbroken man who\u2019s been suddenly left\nby his wife, Liz (Joanna Walley). Initially blinded with rage, Colin seeks revenge by tracking down the \u2018loverboy\u2019\n\u2013 a young man who has been having\nan affair with his wife. He calls upon\nseveral of his ageing gangster friends\nto help capture loverboy and keep him\nprisoner in an abandoned house in a\ndark corner of London.\nThe film is almost entirely shot in a\nsingle room of the abandoned house.\nThe minimal storyline leaves the characters to do all the legwork to make\nthe film half-decent. Fortunately, the\ncast is brilliant, and there is sufficient\ndiversity so your attention shouldn\u2019t\nwaver too much. The confined space\nfilled by several 40-something classic\nBritish actors give the film a Reservoir\nDogs meets Full Monty feel, although\nunfortunately lacks the real gritty drama that was expected.\nRay Winstone gives an over-the-top\nheartbroken performance, and his\novershadowed by his callous friends.\nBe prepared for a tedious masterclass\nof the four letter word from all the\nindividuals, especially Jon Hurt\u2019s brilliant character \u2018Old man peanut\u2019. The\ngrumpy old git contrasts brilliantly to\nIan McShane\u2019s suave personality, and\ntheir banter is comical throughout.\nDirector Malcolm Venville applies his\nown bizarre element to the film in an\nattempt to deepen Ray Winstone\u2019s distressed character, but just makes him\nlook foolish.\nConsidering most recent British\ngangster films involve Danny Dyer\nchucking bricks at West Ham fans,\nthis a fresh change. But in general I\ndoubt people want to see a bunch of\ncriminals, well past their sell-by-date,\ntirelessly monologing about marital\nproblems.\nWriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto last collaboration, Sexy Beast (2000),\nis much more memorable than this\none. Only the darkly comic actors save\nthis film from pure mediocrity.\ntelligence make for an endearing char-acter. Whitecross walks this tightrope\nbetween sympathy and contempt immaculately throughout, as Dury shines\non stage his desperate, malicious antics\ntowards his family and friends contrast\npurposely creating an immensely absorbing protagonist.\nIntricately told among Dury\u2019s rise to\nfame and his subsequent decline are\nhis relationships with his long-suffer-ing wife Betty (Olivia Williams) and his\nyoung lover Denise (Naomie Harris) as\nthey both fluctuate with pure anger\nat his selfishness to a loving fondness\nof his rare tenderness. However it his\nrelationship with son Baxter which\nprovides the most compelling of sub-plots, Baxter is played by the young\nBill Milner who maturely and splendidly complements the wild antics of\nhis father as he is taken on tour and\nplaced under the sensible watch of the\n\u2018Sulphate Strangler\u2019. Dury\u2019s relationship with his father (Ray Winstone)\nis also cleverly incorporated into film\nand adds yet another layer of depth to\nthe complex emotional input of Dury\nwho fables his respect for his father\nin the eternal \u2018My Old Man\u2019. There is\nalso a touching and thought-provoking\nside-story into Dury\u2019s contribution to\nthe United Nations year of the disabled\nwith his infamous song \u2018spasticus autisticus\u2019 that is pivotal to understanding Dury and is excellently embedded\ninto narrative by Whitecross.\nDo you need to be fan of Dury or The\nBlockheads to enjoy this?\nAbsolutely not, it is an absorbing,\nexciting and subtle tear jerker of a film\nthat provides a wonderful insight into\nthe life of one of the most unique individuals to emerge in the late 70s, irrespective of whether you love, hate or\nknow nothing of Dury, it is a dynamic,\nhuman and buoyant film with an unprecedented kaleidoscope of energy in\nits protagonist that makes for highly\ncharged viewing. In a final swansong\nWhitecross allows Dury to hit every\nviewer with his rhythm stick once\nmore.\nA dazzling taste of Italian style\nJohnPark\nJohnPark\nDirector Rob Marshall\nScreenwriter James Cameron\nCast Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana,\nSigourney Weaver\nRunning Time 162 mins\nNine\nAmong the never-ending stream of\nmodern musical films, there were some\nhits, (Moulin Rouge, Hairspray) complete critical/financial flops (2009\u2019s\nFame and Rent) and those in between\n(Evita, The Phantom of the Opera). But\nbefore you say \u201cOh no, not another\nflashy, camp, musical film\u201d, Nine turns\ninto a complex character study of one\ncomplicated film director.\nNine is based on an Italian masterpiece 8 \u00bd directed by Federico Fellini,\nwhich incidentally is based on Fellini\nhimself. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Guido\nContini, a troubled but once talented\nfilm director who is failing to write a\nsingle word for his script even when\nthe costumes are being made, the sets\nare being built, and the film is supposed to be shot in ten days. His writer\u2019s block is worsened by the complicated relationships he shares with the\nvarious women in his life. Day-Lewis\u2019\nContini is not Marcello Mastroianni\u2019s\nGuido in 8 \u00bd but is a more confused,\nburnt-out, and most importantly, is an\noriginal character that does not try to\nmimic the old version in any way.\nTo be honest, who wouldn\u2019t be\nslightly distracted in his situa-tion? He\u2019s surrounded by beautiful women; his wife Luisa (Marion\nCotillard), his seductive mistress\nCarla (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), his\nmuse Claudia (Nicole\nKidman), his confidante Lilane (Judi\nDench), Stephanie\n(Kate Hudson) a\nstunning reporter\nwho wants to have a\ngood lay with Contini more than anything else, memories of his Mamma\n(Sophia Loren), and\na prostitute from his\nchildhood, Saraghina\n(Stacey \u2018Fergie\u2019 Ferguson) who taught him\nthe art of love-making.\nAll of these characters\nare introduced in a\nspectacular opening\nsequence where the\nwomen\u2019s relationships with Guido are\nbriefly explained.\nReading the long\nlist of fabulous actors\ncan build up unwanted hype and expecta-tions. We all know they\ncan act full stop. Just\nbetween the eight of\nthem they share seven\nOscar wins and eleven\nfurther nominations.\nCotillard gives a quiet\nbut intense performance as the victim of Contini\u2019s numerous affairs, her intense rendition\nof \u201cTake it All\u201d making the audience\ntruly sympathise with the situation this\nwoman is in, Cruz is overflowing with\nsex appeal, more so when she\u2019s twisting and wrapping her body around\nropes and curtains, Kidman blesses the\nscreen with her angelic, beautiful presence etc... But the important factor is\nto remember that this is a musical and\nto ask the crucial question of whether\nthey can sing. Well, of course they can.\nThe casting of Day-Lewis was considered to be an odd one when first\nannounced. No-one knew whether he\ncould sing or not, and no-one really\nknew whether he could be convincing as an Italian. But once again, he\ndoesn\u2019t disappoint and his performance is faultless. He surprises all of us\nwhen he proves that his singing is just\nas powerful and effective as his acting.\nHe only sings a couple of songs, but\nthey\u2019re unforgettable ones. His scruffy\nappearance reflects his chaotic lifestyle\nand it\u2019s not surprising that he\u2019s struggling to write a script.\nHudson, although stuck with a character who doesn\u2019t end up being too cru-cial, is given her moment to shine with\nprobably one of the best and memorable songs in the film, \u201cCinema Italiano.\u201d\nShe sings and dances her heart out, as\ndo the backing singers/dancers. The\nmusic is immediately catchy, as is the\nelectrifying choreography that Hudson\nhandles perfectly.\nA special round of applause however,\nmust go to Ferguson, who arguably delivers the best musical\nnumber in the film. For\nthose who have seen\nthe trailers, the song\n\u201cBe Italian\u201d will be quite\nfamiliar. But just wait\nuntil you see\nthe big pic-ture, when\nthe big\nscreen\nand\nsound\nsystems\ncapture\nFerguson\u2019s bold,\nsteady\nvoice as well\nas the sexy,\ndangerous and\ncaptivating visu-als. The song\ncovers two very\ndifferent timelines and styles.\nThere\u2019s Contini\u2019s\nintimate black-and-white flashback of Saraghina teaching the\never-so enthusiastic boys about\nsex, and then\nthere\u2019s the more\npassion-ate,\nfull-coloured (very effectively in red\nand black) scene of Saraghina, various\nother women, sand and tambourines.\nWhat\u2019s more impressive is Fergie\u2019s perfect transformation into her character.\nShe gained something like eight kilos\nand with her push-up dress, messy hair\nand glaring eyes, she looks exactly like\nsomeone who successfully sells sex for\na living, promising to fulfill all the hidden male fantasies.\nDue to the large cast, some actresses\naren\u2019t given enough deserving focus.\nLoren, Dench and Kidman are all marvellous singers but are all underused.\nGiving each and every one of them\nthe full attention would probably have\nbrought the running time right up to\nthe three-hour mark and could have\nbeen overly tedious. But it\u2019s just not\nthat easy to forget all about the three\nfabulous actresses after their stunning\nbut brief appearances.\nNine is a sophisticated, dazzling,\nsavvy musical. Rob Marshall delivers a\nmore stylish, focused film than his previous musical effort Chicago. There is\na noticeable lack of memorable songs,\nand it won\u2019t be easy to hum the songs\nagain outside the cinema but it\u2019s hard\nto care when you can remember the\nastonishing choreography and faultless\nperformances in a\nheart-beat.\ng made, the sets\nthe film is sup-n days.

The dam, they said, would affect\ncommunities and wildlife by interfering with the annual supply of nutrient-rich floodwaters that nourish grazing\nareas and wetlands.\nThe Ethiopian government argued\na pressing need for hydro-electricity,\ndismissing environmental effects as\n\u201cminimal\u201d. There is little recourse for\nopposing groups. Although in August\n2009 a lobby group managed to persuade the African Development Bank\n(AfDB) to review their financing of the\nproject on environmental grounds,\nconstruction is ongoing.\nThe controversy surrounding the\nGibe dam is redolent of an era in which\nenvironmental challenges are increasingly complex and trans-boundary.\nThe drivers of problems such as water\nuse, deforestation and pollution are\ndiffuse and complex, no longer confined to local actions that can easily be\naddressed.\nWhat responses have we crafted to\nmeet this challenge? Global environmental protection consists of little\nmore than a handful of narrow bilateral and multilateral treaties, underpinned by enforcement mechanisms\nthat relate only to states \u2013 whilst interested parties as well as transgressors\ninclude NGOs and private actors.\nThere is an apparent mismatch between the interdependence of global\nenvironmental problems and the absence of global governance to address\nsuch problems.\nWitness the difficulties in securing agreement in Copenhagen, where\ncountries struggled to agree a coherent and legally binding response to\nthe potential threat of climate change.\nConsider also hapless attempts to rescue the blue-fin tuna from commercial\nextinction even as the last viable stocks\nare depleted. International companies\nare currently free to conduct their\nmost polluting activities in countries\nwhere environmental controls are\nleast stringent, with a good chance of\nimpunity.\nEnter the International Court for the\nEnvironment (ICE), offered as a leap\ntowards multi-lateral, trans-boundary\nstewardship of the environment.\nProponents envisage an international\ncourt constituted for the adjudication\nand enforcement of existing and future\nenvironmental treaties, underpinned\nby a robust lawmaking institution and\npermissive of access by a range of parties including states, non-governmen-tal and private actors.\nThese are ambitious aims \u2013 but then\nthe court is meant to address an urgent\nchallenge. Current environmental\nprotections have failed to stem the tide\nof pollution, deforestation, species loss\nand other environmental degradation.\nBut creating such a court outright is\nunrealistic and so the ICE Coalition,\nwhich is pushing the proposal, envisages that the ICE could evolve slowly\nby starting out as a voluntary dispute\ntribunal.\nAn \u201cinterim\u201d court would allow state\nand non state actors to seek ad-hoc\nclarifications and judgements on environmental disputes, on a voluntary\nbasis. The coalition hopes to make\nthe interim ICE a tribunal of choice\nto resolve trans-national environmental disputes, generating momentum\ntowards a more universal and binding\ncourt in future years.\nA post-Kyoto agreement, if agreed in\nCopenhagen or thereafter, might make\na useful testing ground for an interim\ncourt. At present, Kyoto is enforced by\na committee branch with recourse to\nthe International Court of Justice (ICJ)\n- in whose chambers no environmental\ndispute has ever been heard. There is\nan opportunity for an ICE to fill this\ngap in the legal architecture in future\nagreements.\nHowever constituted, the ICE will\nface the challenge of convincing states\nto surrender judgement on environmental matters. Notions of supranational justice are already problematic \u2013 the International Criminal Court\n(ICC) has been labelled biased by some\ndeveloping nations for targeting states\nopposed to Western interests and val-ues. The Chinese government rejects\nthe ICC, whilst the US will not ratify\nthe agreement because it supersedes\nthe US constitution.\nThe interim ICE would be an entirely\ndifferent animal, but some states will\nundoubtedly view the idea of a global\nlegal authority on environmental matters with great suspicion.\nAnticipating this, the coalition argues\nthat developing states would have the\nmost to gain from an ICE, providing\nthem access to justice against government and private actors who cause environmental harm to their territories.\nProviding locus standi to non-state\nactors is an ultimate aim, though the\ncoalition hints that in order to secure\nsupport from states, private parties\nmight only secure declarations and\nnon-binding remedies. This sounds\nrather toothless, yet the threat of embarrassment before an international\nbody is a potent lever.\nThe ICE coalition is optimistic, and\nhopes that against the current backdrop\nof increasing environmental awareness an interim ICE could be created\nin much less than the ten years it took\nto create the ICC. An interim court\nmight not yet forcibly hold states to ac-count, but it may change the manner in\nwhich international environmental disputes are approached, a so-called \u201cgame\nchanger\u201d.\nReaching the end state will require\nhard lobbying, backed up by a successful interim ICE and support from certain key states. If successful, the position of groups like those in the lower\nOmo valley might be better heard and\nunderstood in future.\nAbove: The Gibe\nIII dam Is under\nconstruction on\nthe Omo river in\nEthiopia, 300km\nsouthwest of\nAddis Ababa.\nThe dam will\nprovide 1,800\nmegawatts\nof electricity.\nThis will more\nthan double\nthe country\u2019s\ncurrent\ngenerating\ncapacity in\none hit, and\naccording\nto Prime\nMinister Meles\nZenawi, solve a\nnational energy\ncrisis. Below:\nprojected\nflooding effects\nof the Gibe\ndam, shown as a\nbefore and after\nsituation.\nICE - The way forward?\nEnvironmental justice - not yet out of the woods, no matter what you think\nHarry Brainch\nHarry Brainch\nIn brief\nIn a speech to the\nRoyal Society this\nweek Nick Clegg\nhas critisied UK libel\nlaws for being a \u2018legal farce\u2019 and having\na \u2018chilling effect\u2019 on\nscientific enquiry.\nClegg dubbed the\ncurrent group set up by Jack Straw to look into the\ncase for libel reform as \u2018dithering\u2019 and has promised\ncommitment to greater protection for scientists\nand doctors questioning claims made by organi-sations. He stressed that \u2018scientists must be able\nto question claims fearlessly especially those that\nrelate to medical care, environmental damage and\npublic safety.\u2019 The speech is particularly relevant in\nlight of the ongoing high-profile libel case lodged\nby the British Chiropractic Association against science writer Simon Singh.\nCall for butter ban\nA leading heart surgeon at UCL Hospital\nhas claimed a ban on\nbutter would save\nthousands of lives\neach year. Shyam\nKolvekar has said\nforcing a reduction\nof saturated fat could\nsee a fall in the number of cases of cardiovascular\ndiease and save the economy around \u00a38billion in\nthe process. The claim stems from Kolvehar\u2019s treatment of patients as young as 30 with heart conditions typically found amongst the 50-60 age group.\nWhilst an outright ban on butter seems a little ex-treme, it\u2019s not an idea without support. In North\nKarelia, Finland an 82% reduction in heart disease\namongst men since 1969 has been largely attributed\nto switching butter for lower fat alternatives.\nNutt\u2019s replacement\nannounced\nNick Clegg pledges\nlibel law reform\nProfessor Les Iverson has been named\nas the new chair of\nthe Advisory Council on the Misuse of\nDrugs following the\nsacking of Professor\nDavid Nutt last year.\nProf. Iverson is a retired pharmacologist\nand former Oxford academic who himself once\nexpressed views on cannabis similar to those held\nby Prof. Nutt. He is even quoted as having said in\nthe past \u2018cannabis should be legalised\u2019 although he\nmaintains his view on the subject has since changed\nin light of updated scientific evidence.

A state-backed turnaround organisation has taken managerial control of the company, and injected 1 trillion yen\n($11 billion) to keep the flights in the air.\nShares of JAL, have fallen more than 90 percent since the start of the month,\nand with a market value of about $150 million, JAL is now smaller than minor carriers like Croatia Airlines, and is worth less than one Boeing 747. The\nbankruptcy has also had an impact on Japan\u2019s politics.

The Haitian parliament was destroyed during the\nearthquake, as were a third of the buildings in the capital, and lines of most\ncommunication. The government now convenes daily in a run-down police\nstation near the airport. The UN mission in the country has also suffered\nheavily, losing many of its staff, including the head and deputy head of the\nmission.

Both sums are far larger than the $3m generally believed to have been\npaid in January last year for the release of the Saudi-owned Sirius Star, the\nlargest ship seized by pirates.\nThe pirates have become increasingly bold and ventured ever further from\ntheir shores since the international community has dispatched as many as 20\nmilitary ships to defend cargoes passing through the area.

The thing is, Apple\nhasn\u2019t done anything this week apart\nfrom send out invitations to a press\nevent to be held in San Francisco on\nJanuary 27th. OK, when Apple holds\na press event they normally unveil\nsomething, but the way that the news\nis saturated you\u2019d think they were going to announce something that\u2019ll end\nworld hunger, eradicate terrorism,\nbring world peace and all with a sleek\nwhite finish.\nSo an Apple event on the 27th. It\u2019s\ngot the tag line \u2018Come see our Latest\nCreation\u2019; if that doesn\u2019t scream Apple tablet I don\u2019t know what does. The\ncurious thing about this event however\nhas to be the inclusion of a select few\nmembers of the gaming press on the\ninvitation list. Getting an invite out\nof Apple to one of its press events is\nlike owning your own plane, it\u2019s simply not going to happen unless you\u2019re\nreally, really important. But to invite\nsome games press indicates that Apple\nthinks something it\u2019s going to unveil at\nthis event is going to appeal to them.\nOK, if you\u2019ve ever seen an Apple ad\nyou\u2019ll have heard the \u2018iPod touch is the\nbest gaming device\u2019 rubbish they try\nand ram down your throat. The App\nStore has a lot of games in it and because they\u2019re relatively cheap, they\u2019ve\ndone well, but there\u2019s no way the iPod\ntouch or the iPhone is as good an ex-SamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nI\nn the first major piracy verdict\nsince the landmark Pirate Bay\ncase, the owner and founder\nof the music sharing website\n\u2018OiNK\u2019s Pink Palace\u2019 was declared not guilty by an unanimous jury\nat the Teesside Crown Court. The case\nis also notable because it\u2019s the first\nmusic piracy trial that has delivered a\nverdict within the UK. While the case\ndoes not set a judicial precedent for future cases, it was a remarkable victory\nfor Alan Ellis, who founded the sharing\nservice during his studies at the University of Teesside.\nHis arrest in 2007 was highly dra-matic, with police inviting TV cameras\nto watch as they carried out a dawn\nraid on Ellis\u2019 house, as Dutch police\nsimultaneously raided his servers in\nthe Netherlands. While Ellis\u2019 operations were much smaller than those of\nThe Pirate Bay (with his case attracting\nmuch less attention), the invite-only\nwebsite had developed a reputation\nfor listing high quality recordings a\nlong time before they were released.\nThe website was even endorsed by\nTrent Reznor, who described it as \u201cthe\nworld\u2019s greatest record store\u201d.\nThe prosecution told the jury that\nEllis was found with nearly $300,000 in\nhis PayPal account and accused him of\n\u201clarge scale, professional, clever, technical ripping off\u201d, while Ellis countered\nthat the money simply came from surplus donations and that it \u201chad to be\nstored somewhere\u201d. Ellis was also able\nto successfully defend the allegations\nof fraud levelled against him by using\na similar argument to the one used by\nThe Pirate Bay - as a torrent tracker,\nhis website merely indexed material\nuploaded by users and didn\u2019t actually\nhost any of the illegal files. It\u2019s also clear\nthat the circumstances around the case\nplayed a large role in the proceedings -The Pirate Bay was a large organisation\nsupported by healthy finances, while\nOiNK\u2019s Palace was distinctly smaller,\nwith Alan Ellis making little if any real\nmoney out of running the website.\nThe verdict has little legal meaning\n- it doesn\u2019t set a binding precedent for\nall future cases - yet it\u2019s the first major\nlegal victory for the now beleaguered\ntorrent community and will probably\nserve as a morale booster at a time\nwhen many major torrent trackers are\nshutting down or sealing themselves\noff from the public. As for Alan Ellis,\nwhile it seems unlikely that \u2018OiNK\u2019s\nPink Palace\u2019 is going to be restored\nto its former glory, he should be able\nto wash his hands of the affair in the\nknowledge that the case isn\u2019t appeal-able and he has emerged virtually unscathed from the experience.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nWow, what a week in tech. Actually to tell you the truth, it\u2019s\nall more or less been rumour\nabout Apple\u2019s flaming tablet.\nThankfully a few other things\nhappened this week, so let\u2019s get\nstuck in eh?\nFirst up we\u2019ve got a man\nkilled by Avatar. Yes Cameron\u2019s 3D, supersmurf epic,\nnot only shattered box office revenue but can also\nkill you. A 42-year-old Taiwanese\ncinema goer suffered a stroke\nlikely brought\non by \u2018over-excitement\u2019 triggered by the film.\nRemember kids,\nit\u2019s not real OK?\nMore ridiculousness\nin the form of \u2018TwittaBling\u2019 this\nweek. Apparently someone\nthought it was a good idea to\nget their Twitter name emblazoned on a medallion and wear\nit out in public. If that\u2019s not bad\nenough you can even get wedding bands with your Twitter handles engraved on the\ninside. Wow. I admittedly use\nTwitter quite a lot but come\non, seriously? That\u2019s just sad.\nEver thought what a 7.5m\ndisco ball would look like? Well\ntake a trip to Paris and you can\nsee one hanging some 50m\nabove the ground sparkling under spotlight.\nThe massive disco\nball consists of 1000\nmirrors and is part\nof a contemporary art exhibition\ncalled Nuit Blanche\nabove the Jardin du\nLuxembourg.\nMore weird and wonderful news, this time from\nBritain. According to a recent\npresentation by ComScore,\nBritain\u2019s most downloaded\niPhone app is iPint. Yes,\nBritain shows\ntheir love of\nbooze by\ndownloading\na pint\nsimulation in\ntheir millions.\nIf you don\u2019t know what iPint\ndoes, find someone with an\niPhone. Chances are they\u2019ll\nhave it.\nMore Apple related strangeness this week and no, not\neven about the iTablet. Apparently 20% of people surveyed\nby Lewis PR in the UK when\nasked who Steve Jobs was, the\nenigmatic CEO of Apple, Inc.,\nthought he was a footballer.\nNow, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen\nthe \u2018Stupid American\u2019 YouTube\nvideos where they go an survey the dumbest people on\nthe planet, but this just goes\nto show that even Brits can be\nmorons. A footballer? I could\nforgive them for thinking he\nwas a politician or a BBC exec,\nbut not the nation\u2019s favourite\npast-time.\nTalking of Steve Jobs, not\neveryone gets everything right\nand even he can be at fault.\nA shocking revelation came\nout this week about the name\nthat Jobs would have given\nthe iMac line if they\u2019d let him:\nthe Macman. Dodged a bullet\nthere Steve.\nGoogle has been in the\nnews a lot this week one way\nor another. Something you\nmight have missed however is\nthat the next iteration of the\nAndroid operating system is\ngoing to be called \u2018FroYo\u2019. Yes\nthat\u2019s right, Frozen Yoghurt.\nSomeone at Google obviously\nhas a food obsession; first we\nhad \u2018cupcake\u2019, then \u2018donut\u2019,\nwith 2.0 called \u2018eclair\u2019. Perhaps\nsomeone\u2019s New Year\u2019s resolution was to eat healthier, FroYo\nindeed.\nSony got in on the post-CES\nnews this week with its new\nhigh-end \u2018only the best will do\u2019\nVaio Z series. Packing an Intel Core\ni7, 6GB RAM, an\nNvidia GT330M\nGPU in parallel\nwith integrated\nIntel HD graph-ics, along\nwith a Full\nHD LED backlit display into\na svelte 1.4Kg 13.3\u201d frame,\nthe Vaio Z is a PC users wet\ndream. A finger print reader,\nwebcam, Bluetooth 2.1 and 3G\nmodem also come along for\nthe ride, making this machine\nspec wise, one of the best laptops ever made. It\u2019ll launch\nin March with pricing unan-nounced, but be sure you\u2019ll\nhave to sell a kidney to afford\none of these bad boys. A trade\nworth making perhaps.\nIn other news Microsoft\nis urging XP\nand IE6 users\nto upgrade\npronoto following the\nGoogle hacking that\u2019s recently taken the\nheadlines.\nMozilla also unleashed Firefox 3.6\nRC2 this week prepping for a final release sometime in the next week or two.\nThe Winter Olympics is\ncoming to Freesat from the\n12th February in HD. This\njoins the World Cup, Six Nations, Golf Masters, Wimbledon and a boat load of European football broadcast in HD. A\ngood time to be a Freesat user.\nSamuel\nSamuel\nGibbs\nGibbs\nTechnology\nEditor\nperience as a proper games console,\nportable or not. Now, that fabled Apple tablet might come with a bit more\noomph in the processing department,\nmaybe even fully fledged graphics, but\nunless it\u2019s got more buttons, some sort\nof expansion controller, it\u2019s not going\nto be any better a gaming experience\nthan the iPod touch. At this stage Apple could be pulling a fast one on us\nwith all this tablet nonsense and is actually prepping an Apple TV replacement games console. Until Steve pulls\none out on the 27th we really don\u2019t\nknow, anything could happen.\nAnother interesting yet mysterious\ntake away from the event announcement is that there\u2019s no European re-peat. Normally when Apple has had an\nannouncement in the US they\u2019ve piped\nthe video into a venue in London in re-al-time. So what does that tell us? Well\nit could mean that whatever they have\nfor us is going to be US-only, at least in\nthe short term. It would be extremely\ndisappointing, but that\u2019s the same tactic they took with the original release\nof the iPhone.\nSpeaking of iPhone, there are also\nrumours we\u2019re going to see iPhone\n4.0 software at the event. Speculated\nhighlights include multi-tasking, system wide multi-touch gestures (maybe\neven on the back for a June/July iPhone\n4G revision), new syncing possibilities\nand UI changes. Could this be the end\nfor the need to jailbreak for most users\nnot seeking an unlock? Check out next\nweek\u2019s coverage for all the information.\nFerozSalam\nFerozSalam Technology Reporter\nr.

The CDMS had, it was said,\nfound evidence of the existence of dark\nmatter.\nIt would have been the last major physics breakthrough of the noughties - but\nsadly, it was not entirely true. The CDMS\nwere announcing their latest results, but\nthose results did not show irrefutable evidence of dark matter\u2019s existence.\nNevertheless, that does not mean\nthat what they have discovered isn\u2019t\nimportant. In a paper submitted to\narXiv on the same day as their announcement talks were held, the\nCDMS team reported that they had\nseen two events characteristic of a\nparticular class of possible dark matter\ncomponents called weakly interacting\nmassive particles, or WIMPs.\nWIMPs are likely to have masses\nsimilar to that of atomic nuclei. Despite having never been seen, they are\nconsidered one of the main candidates\nfor dark matter, with the appropriately\nnamed massive compact halo objects\n(MACHOs) as their main rival. As\nWIMPs only interact through the weak\nnuclear force and gravity, they rarely\ninteract with normal matter, making\nthem very difficult to spot.\nThe CDMS experiment is located\nhalf a mile underground in the disused Soudan mine in Minnesota, and\nuses germanium and silicon detectors\ncooled to almost absolute zero. This\nlow temperature means that if a WIMP\ndoes pass through these crystals, the\nheat it generates will cause a charge\nto move in an applied magnetic field,\nand this in turn will cause a signal to be\nsent to a computer in the lab. Once the\ndata has been collected, it is analysed\nto distinguish the background events\nfrom the interesting ones.\nWhat the CDMS found was two\ninteresting events, showing characteristics that would be expected from\nWIMPs. However, there is still a 23%\nchance that these events were merely\ndue to background particles such as\ncosmic rays or radioactive decay. For\nthere to be no reasonable doubt of a\ndiscovery, i.e. a less than one in a thousand chance that the events seen were\nnot WIMPs, there would need to have\nbeen five events present in the data\nrather than two. Despite not showing\nabsolute proof, the results will help to\nset new upper limits that may rule out\ncertain theories currently proposed to\nexplain the dark matter problem.\nThe CDMS collaboration are now\nin the process of upping the sensitivity of their experiment by trebling the\nnumber of detectors. The upgrade\nshould be finished by summer 2010,\nthen all they can do is sit back and wait\npatiently for some WIMPs to come\nalong.\nKelly Oakes\nKelly Oakes\nThe CDMS uses five towers of six detectors to detect dark matter\n\n"

Nomadic Matt, travel blogger and social media expert\nby\nbyDylanLowe\nDylanLowe\nInterview with the Extraordinaire\nTravel Editor\nDylanLowe\nDylanLowe\nThe Ramblin\u2019\nRucksack Man\nG\n\u2019day. Hope you\u2019ve had a\nstress-free Christmas, not\ntoo pissed off with snow-related travel disruptions\nand what-have-you. And\nhappy new decade to you all - may the\nfollowing tens years be filled with travel\njoys and enlightenments.\nAnd so here I am, your resident drifter\nreporting for duty. Great to be back from\na wee semester at the University of Life on\nthe road and further my education with\nthe musing of the felix team. Well, if they\nwould turn off the webcams and quit\npondering about contraceptive sheaths.\nSpeaking of which, when I first started\nas travel editor around this time last year\nI was very much aware that, unlike my\npeers and co-workers here in the base-ment, I had very much been an epitome\nof technophobia. As though my sole purposes in life were to gallivant and scrib-ble, it took Jovan weeks - months even\n- to hammer knowledge of InDesign\nfunctionalities into my perfectly organic\nhead. And what was that you were talking about, Richard Lai, about twitter and\ngadgets and social networking? Jibberish.\nAnd who said I\u2019d need to mingle with\nfellow travellers online, consult travel\nblogs for advice and preview a hostel with\na review? No thanks, a Lonely Planet and\nrucksack will suffice.\nLittle did I then realise how embroiled\nI have been in the world of social media\nsince becoming involved in the STA\nTravel Explorer Programme.\nAs part of their social media campaign,\nthe legendary travel agency created the\nprogramme to bring together its customers who would share their travel experiences through blogging, photo-sharing\nand video-hosting.\nSulking in the bleak winter - and immense boredom that were the outskirts\nof Auckland - I was once again dreaming\nof the mid-July heat I\u2019d have been soaking\nup in the northern hemisphere. My trip\nto Fiji, at the time, remained distant in future tense. Catching the STA Travelbuzz\nwebsite (http://www.statravelbuzz.co.uk)\nflickering across the monitor, reading\nstories written by other explorers and\nbearing in mind that I ought to establish\na somewhat travel-journal-keeping habit\nthrough blogging, I was tempted into\nsigning up for the programme.\nAlmost immediately, across 11 time\nzones, the charming Camilla and the\nSTA Travelbuzz team recruited and welcomed me onboard with open arms.\nFollowedweretheself-propelledtutorials on social media and the online tools it\nentails. Disregarding my old conceptions\ntwitter and flickr - both I had condescendingly shunned like a plane passenger would shun a Nigerian - were within\nmy grasp, as I willed them to promote my\nblog, generate readership and spread the\nword about my experiences in the South\nPacific, as the guys had instructed.\nNot that I was totally unprepared for\nthis change of lifestyle - I\u2019ve kept my Facebook account mainly to stay connected\nwith the amazing characters I\u2019ve met\nalong my travels.\nI was adjusting to hearing tales of incredible human feats on a daily basis. I\nlearnt to appreciate the partnership integrating travel and social media, with\nexamples no less real than my experience\non Tribewanted: Vorovoro. I met fellow\ntravellers not only in hostel lounges but\nalso in the comfort of my home, whose\nexperiences are of no less validity only\nbecause our encounter took place in the\nvirtual world.\nThrough twitter I arranged a meeting with Matt Kepnes, more commonly\nknown as Nomadic Matt, in a pub opposite Victoria Station - the American was\nin transit, on his way back to Thailand\nfrom Belgium. The same site enabled\nPaul Smith, the Twitchhiker as he likes\nto be known as, to travel from Newcastle\nto New Zealand entirely reliant upon the\ngenerosity of fellow \u2018tweeple\u2019.\nAnd so that was me, consuming mates\u2019\nhospitality and weeping to Michael\nMcIntyre for the thousandth time aside,\neither drowning in social media debauchery or in my own vomit (hope you\u2019ve had\na great New Years Eve as well) throughout the holiday.\nAll thanks to the STA Travelbuzz\nteam who, to both my amusement and\nannoyance, decided to grant me the\npseudonym Ramblin\u2019 Rucksack Man.\nYup, laugh on.\nBut is it too much? Can social media\nbecome an obsession, lure its audience\ninto the convenience and sense of safety\nand further detach them from reality?\nWhy am I tolerating the deprivation of\nthrill, the adrenaline-clenching moments\nand unpredictability that I look forward\nto the most during my travels?\nAs I launch my new travel website,\nTheTravellingEditor.com, this coming\nSaturday. I must ask myself: have I gone\ntoo far? Have I plunged into the cradle of\nintelligence without protecting my ethics\nas a traveller?\nFuck this - I need to get out more.\nS\nimply put, one simply cannot\nbe a travel social networker\nwhen he\u2019s never heard of Nomadic Matt. What made his\ndeeds remarkable - to the extent that The New York Times requested\nan interview with him - wasn\u2019t just his\ncasting-aside of a steady career to embark on a nomadic lifestyle, one that has\nto-date lasted for three years. It was that\nthe Bostonian is now generating enough\nincome through running his travel blogs\nand other online ventures that he needed\nno other sources of revenue to fund his\ntravels.\nNow, the man who has brought tips\non budgetting and long-term travel now\nsat before Camilla and I; over a pint in\nShakespeare the travel talk commenced.\nDylan Lowe Hi guys. We have the legendary Nomadic Matt among us.\nMatt Kepnes Great to be here.\nDL Can I just say how much I admire\nwhat you\u2019ve been doing. Truly inspiring - it\u2019s inspired me for sure.\nMK Thank you.\nDL So, what prompted you to quit\nyour job and embark on a nomadic\nlifestyle?\nMK I took a trip back in 2005 to Thailand. I met some backpackers then and I\nwas fascinated with what they were do-ing. I wanted to do that. It seemed a lot\nof fun so I finished my MBA, quit my\njob. I spent another 18 months travelling and decided to continue travelling - I\nhaven\u2019t stopped ever since. All my life, the\nbest decisions are made with the gut! It\u2019s\nworked out since.\nDL You are the epitome of a social\nmedia guru. But how important, in\nyour opinion, is social media in the\nworld of travel?\nMK Social media is very important.\nTwitter, Facebook, my blog, all allow me\nto get travel tips and advice to places I am\ngoing, meet locals, and meet other trav-ellers. Without social media, travelling\nwouldn\u2019t be as fun. It helps you connect\nwith people a lot more.\nDL What are your predictions for\ntechnology in conjunction with\ntravel?\nMK More people will use devices like\ntheir iPhone to get real-life travel information and facts while they are on the\nroad.\nDL Many people would have accused\nyou for running away from reality -how do you respond to that?\nMK To say that is ridiculous. We travel\nnot to run away from life, or from reality\n- in fact we\u2019re running towards it. Cultures, places, people, they define life, not\nthe office cubicle, marriage or children.\nAnd the freedom - it\u2019s the same freedom\nI found in the travellers I met in Thailand that inspired me to travel in the first\nplace.\nDL Any spark of romance along your\njourney?\nMK Lots of little romances.\nDL If you have one secret craving\nfor some kind of stable living, what\nwould it be?\nMK A steady girlfriend.\nDL Thought so. The traveller\u2019s curse.\nWhy don\u2019t you stop travelling and\nlive that dream?\nMK Because I\u2019d much rather find the\none, travel, and live the dream together.\nDL What would you say to aspiring\ntravel writers/bloggers hoping to do\nsomething similar to what you do?\nMK Network. Get your blog up and run-ning, write stuff, and network with everybody and anybody in order to get your\nname out there. Keep networking. It\u2019s\ngoing to take a lot of time before you get\nnoticed but if you are persistent you will.\nHave I gone too far?

We haven\u2019t been to England\nsince it\u2019s been out have we?\nD- No, I don\u2019t think you have yet.\nB- Yeah, so I\u2019m excited to find out what\nthe reception\u2019s like in England, we\u2019ve\njust been touring around America for\na while.\nD- How much of the media do you\nread once you\u2019ve released material,\naround the world, obviously being\non tour, do you read the local media?\nB- I try not to read about the band or\nthe album at all. Sometimes my mom\nand my friends send me stuff, otherwise I don\u2019t really pay it much atten-tion... I try not to. People\u2019s reactions to\nthe latest record are kind of the same as\nour reaction to the record the first few\ntimes we heard it. It kind of settles in\nand you take it for what it is, you know.\nD- Absolutely. You\u2019re coming to\nBritain for the first leg of your trav-els. When are you guys arriving in\nLondon?\nB- I think we get there Thursday and\nwe leave Sunday... We\u2019re just coming\nfor the weekend because we have a\nbunch of make-up shows we got to do\nback in the States before. So we\u2019re going to do that and we\u2019re talking about\ncoming back maybe sometime over the\nsummer but nothing\u2019s concrete yet.\nD- Are you going to head straight\nback home after the weekend in London then?\nB- Yeah, we come back home for like\ntwo days and then we have to head out\nwest to do a few shows where we got\nsick on the last tour that we have to\nmake up for.\nD- Wembley Arena is a much larger\nvenue than most British audiences\nare use to seeing you in, have you got\nanything special lined up for that?\nB- We ended up our last tour in America with our first arena headline, in\nAmerica, over here in our hometown,\nand we just added a tonne of production to it. We\u2019re going to see what\nhappens and kind of play it by ear but\nwe\u2019re going do the same kind of show\nand the same kind of production we\ndid here, so we\u2019re hoping people like it.\nIt\u2019s kind of a daunting thing to go to a\nvenue like that, we\u2019re kind of new to it\nso we\u2019re feeling it out.\nD- As a drummer do you prefer the\nsmaller intimate venues or do you\nprefer the larger venues, or is there\nany difference?\nB- There\u2019s definitely a difference, it\u2019s\nkind of a love-hate thing. I enjoy eve-rything. I enjoy the smaller clubs a lot\nmore but at the same time it\u2019s good\nto play the bigger ones sometimes.\nThis year we\u2019re going to try and split\nit up and maybe do a tour of a bunch\nof smaller venues all around the world\nalso, and then try and do the bigger\nones, so it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\nD- Do you consider coming to Wembley and playing an arena hitting\nyour peak over here in the UK?\nB- Maybe, we\u2019ll see, I\u2019m not really sure\nhow it\u2019s selling and how it\u2019s doing\nso...\nD- I think it\u2019s all\nsold out.\nB- Is it? No matter what, playing a\nvenue like Wembley in general is\nsomething I never really thought I\u2019d be\ndoing so it\u2019s definitely a highlight of all\nour time playing in a band.\nD- Have you always been quite confident about your popularity over here\nin the UK?\nB- I think when we go over there we all\nfeel like the kids get it a lot more over\nthere than anywhere else. We enjoy\nplaying there a lot more than playing\nanywhere else for sure... If we\u2019re confident about it I don\u2019t know, but we like\nit more.\nD- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the same deal\nwith America but over here your audiences are effectively growing up\nwith you guys as a band, does it make\nyou proud that the young teenagers\nthat came to see you in 2003 when\nDeja Entendu was out, are still attending your gigs in 2010 as young\nadults now.\nB- Yeah, that\u2019s something that I think\nwe all appreciate a lot and something\nthat we\u2019ve noticed, touring on this\nrecord more than anything that there are\nkids that are 16-17 but there\u2019s also\nadults that are our age at this point and\nI think that that\u2019s something we can all\nrelate to and something that\u2019s pretty\nrad. I think we\u2019re all stoked on that.\nD- Does that mean you\u2019ll never outage your audience?\nB- I hope, we\u2019ll see. I mean, so far we\u2019ve\nlucked out with it.\nD- So you don\u2019t think there\u2019s going\nto be a point when you guys are going to think \u2018Oh man, we\u2019re way too\nold to be relating to the audiences\nnow\u2019 \u2013 and in time give up?\nB- Nah, we never look at it that way.\nWe make music however we want\nto make music and since we\u2019ve been\ngrowing up we\u2019re just making the kind\nof music we have just because we\u2019re\ngrowing up and that\u2019s what it is, and\nwe hope that people can relate to it because of that, you know.\nD- It\u2019s a sort of natural progression\nwith your music and whoever you relate to is whoever you relate to?\nB- I think that\u2019s a big key, there\u2019s nothing forced with it, it just is what it is\nand hopefully kids pick up on that... or\nadults.\nD- So you guys founded your own\nrecord label, Procrastinate! Music\nTraitors! in 2008, what\u2019s the thinking behind that? Are you setting up\nlife after Brand New?\nB- It\u2019s nothing we started to make\nmoney off of or anything, it\u2019s just kind\nof a name that we use; we can put on\nrecords if we want to help our friends\nout or if we decide to put our own stuff\nout, we\u2019re releasing our own vinyl on\nthe label in March, or just for the future in general. If any of us want to put\nour own projects, we have something\nto do it on. There\u2019s no other intentions\nwith it whatsoever right now. There\u2019s\nno plan to release a lot of records or\nanything like that, it\u2019s just for our use,\nwith whatever we want we can slap a\nlabel on it and see what happens.\nD- Are you aware of the other meanings of the acronym PMT?\nB- No!? What is it?\nD- I\u2019ll let you figure it out for yourself\nafterwards! You released the track\n\u2018Fork and Knife\u2019 as a download-only\nsingle after your third album, Devil\nand the God are Raging Inside Me.\nIs the label going to be fronting anymore of those kind of releases?\nB- Maybe, at this point everything is\nup in the air, we\u2019re going to see. We\ndon\u2019t know where our home is going to\nbe in a few months and we don\u2019t know\nif we\u2019re ever going to release a record\nagain because if it\u2019s something where\nwe\u2019re doing our own thing I don\u2019t know\nif people even care about records any-more, because the physical part of having a record has lost its appeal, it\u2019s not\nthat cool to us anymore. If we\u2019re going\nto be releasing digitally I have no problem with releasing 3 songs a week or\n1 song a week because i feel like that\nsuits what\u2019s going on now.\nD- A lot of people argue buying a\nrecord isn\u2019t just about the music, it\u2019s\nabout the whole package: the artwork and leaflet for example. Are\nyou worried that it\u2019s going to become\nnostalgic to a point where you\u2019re going to be looking back at physical\nrecords and CDs?\nB- I think there\u2019s something to say\nabout having limited edition things\nalso, it\u2019s special when bands release\n2000 and something, or whatever it is\nand I think we\u2019re always going to be\ndoing that because we\u2019re still into that,\nwe\u2019re still into the physical aspect of\nmusic and artwork and I think we\u2019re\nalways going to be into it. It\u2019s almost\nas big a part of putting out a record as\nthe music is, so it would be a shame\nif we didn\u2019t release anything physi-cal. I\u2019m sure we will, I\u2019m just not sure\nif it\u2019s going to be on the grand scale of\na whole record with packaging, maybe\nwe\u2019ll do 7\u201d here or maybe we\u2019ll release\na CD single here or something like that\nand not press \u2018x amount\u2019 just make it a\nspecial thing, I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re\ngearing towards more.\nA decade and counting\nBrand New are an alternative band hailing from Long Island, New York that formed in 2000. Signed up\nto Triple Crown Records in 2001, they released their debut album, Your Favourite Weapon. For their\nsecond studio album Deja Entendu, with Interscope Records, there was a stylistic change for the band\nto post-hardcore and the album was a huge critical success. In 2008 the band founded their own record\nlabel \u2018Procrastinate! Music Traitors\u2019, on which they co-release their current records.\n\n"

Politics you can handle but when it comes\nto films, you don\u2019t know diddly squat. To save you from looking like an idiot again I\u2019ve made you a present. So\nhere\u2019s a nifty little guide for all you philistines who don\u2019t know your Soderberg from your Spielberg.\nLegendary Directors\nAlfred Hitchcock - Although he turned out\nclassic after classic Hitchcock never won an\nOscar. When the Academy finally bothered\nto award him an \u2018honoury\u2019 one, he replied\nwith the shortest acceptance speech ever\u201cThankyou\u201d. He was a Londoner too.\nHow a pretentious film geek has different opinions on very popular films\nWhat you would say: What the film geek says:\nForest Gump - Quality Film! The story is really good, I think\nit\u2019s really clever how Forest keeps on changing what he does to\nkeep the audience entertained. Tom Hanks\u2019 acting is amazing!\nSaving Private Ryan - The Normandy beach landing is\nincredibly realistic and gritty. The film is excellent at portraying\nthe absurdity of war and the battle at the end is brilliant!\nForest Gump? Moronic Gump is a more fitting title. The episodic\nformat of the film is tedious and throws no surprises. Tom Hanks\u2019\nperformance is simply irritating. I recommend If... instead.\nCitizen Kane - Old man dies and drops snow\nglobe muttering \u2018rosebud\u2019. News reporters try\nbut fail to find out what rosebud means, turns out\nit\u2019s the name of his...\nDirected by and starring the great Orson Welles.\nMethod Acting - The ultimate style of acting\nthough peronal experience to truely understand\nyour character. For example; Robert de Niro\ndrove a taxi for a year for Taxi Driver.\nNew Wave - Any movement in cinema in which\na new ethos of filmmaking emerges, the French\nNew Wave being the most famous.\nAuteur - A director with his own unique style\nevident in all his films. Stanley Kubrick was one\nof the greatest auteurs.\nFemale fatale - A beautiful woman with hidden\nagendas who causes the downfall of a man.\nThe Fourth Wall - If a character breaks the\nfourth wall he directly addresses the audience\nlike Michael Caine does in Alfie.\nHigh Concept - Film\u2019s premise shortened to one\nsentence, think shark eats tourists for Jaws. High\nconcepts are designed to appeal to big audiences\nKitchen Sink - British Socialist dramas about\nthe working class usually set in north. The only\nreason why anyone has heard of Barnsley.\nAkira Kurosawa - The master of Japanese\nCinema. The Good The Bad and The\nUgly, The Magnificent Seven, Star Wars\nand Vantage Point are all rip-offs of his\nfilms. He also made Shakespeare actually\nentertaining with the epic film Ran.\nThe \u2018Classics\u2019 Speak the Lingo\nVittorio de Sica - During the 50s the\nItalians ruled the film world until the\nFrench stole their crown. De Sica\u2019s\n\u2018Neorealist\u2019 films were a breath of fresh\nsocialist air against the glossy movies of the\nHollywood studio system.\nDavid Lynch - To be really cool you have to\nclaim you enjoy this guy\u2019s films. Eraserhead\nwas beyond surreal and then there is\nNaked Lunch which will haunt your dreams\nfor ever. Play the Lynch card in a discussion\non film and you will be worshipped by all.\nCasablanca - Humphrey Bogart is happy making\nmoney during WW2 but then his ex turns up with\nher hubby needing a favour. Bogey doesn\u2019t want\nto help but then he does and there\u2019s some drama\nand a happy ending. Oh and there are loads of\nNazis.\nThe Godfather - Wedding, offers you can\u2019t\nrefuse, sleeping with fishes, ba da bing, revenge,\nSicily, dead wife, new wife, dead brother, dead\ndad, new godfather, lots of shooting, dead Dons,\nlying to the wife, kiss my ring!\n2001 A Space Odyssey - Ape-men find a big\nrectangular rock, ape-man throws bone in the\nair. Jump cut to waltzing spaceship. Spacemen\nfind another rock on moon. Jump cut to different\nspaceship, creepy computer goes crazy but fails\nto kill Dave. Jump cut to another rock in space, it\u2019s\nlike the start of Doctor Who. Jump cut to a weird\nhouse, Dave gets old really quickly. Jump cut to\nDave in space, he\u2019s turned into a fetus. The End.\nNo more Spiderman\nfor Tobey Maguire\nSam Raimi has walked away\nfrom Spiderman 4 due to\nproblems with the script. Sony\nPictures have now announced\na franchise reboot without\nMaguire concentrating on\nSpideys adolescent years. Raimi\nis rumoured to be now working\non a World of Warcraft project\nAvatar closing in on\nTitanic at the box office\nJames Cameron now holds\nthe prestigious title of\nmost successful filmmaker\never. Avatar has raked in\n$1,624,059,398 in worldwide\nticket sales putting it in second\nplace to Titanic whose total\nsales amounted to a whopping\n$1,835,300,000\nGolden Globe voters\nagree with the hype.\nJames Cameron took the Best\nDirector award for Avatar which\nalso won Best Motion Picture.\nHow the Academy will respond\nwhen the Oscars roll by will be\ninteresting to see. Meanwhile\nMartin Scorsese was awarded\nthe Cecil B.

    "content": "9\nfelix FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010\nI\nam a stranger in a strange land.\nAs much I adore this sprawling\nmetropolis, the inkblot on the\ncosmic sketchbook that is London, I know in my heart that it\u2019s\nnot home. You see, I\u2019m not from round\nthese parts. I\u2019m not even English \u2013 not\nthat should shock one the most multicultural student bodies in the country.\nIf you have been at all confused by my\nsomewhat uncommon nomenclature,\nI can assure you it is peculiar to my\nhome country. I come from that beloved corner of Britain where the grass\nis greener and the rain is wetter. Wales.\nThat old land of my fathers, where\nthere are more sheep than vowels and\nwhere people communicate across\nthe valleys with scores of male voice\nchoirs, is where I call home.\nHere\u2019s a joke for you:\nWhat do you call a sheep tied to a\nlamppost in the middle of Cardiff? A\nleisure centre. Haha.\nAs devastatingly funny as that paragon of humour was, it is not an accurate depiction of my country. And yet\nthis is what people think of when I tell\nthem I\u2019m from Wales, which is a shame\nof the highest calibre. Wales is such a\nlovely country, rich in culture and his-tory; at least, that\u2019s what I think but,\nhey, maybe I\u2019m biased. Anyway, consider this a whistle-stop tour of the real\ngreen and pleasant land.\nFirst off, the sheep. Yes, we do have\na lot of them. In fact, they outnumber\nthe people four to one, which is why I\nhope and pray they never revolt. We\nwould be screwed! Keeping the sheep\npeaceful is one reason why we don\u2019t\nshag them. The other reason is because\nit\u2019s weird, and not the least bit icky.\nNext, castles. Wales has lots of cas-tles. If you don\u2019t have a castle, you\u2019re\nnothing. The reason we have so many\nis because they\u2019re useful things to have\nwhen you find yourself being invaded.\nAnd people like invading Wales; Romans, Irish, Vikings, French (though\nwe beat them) and it\u2019s like a hobby\nfor the English or something. If you\u2019re\never in Wales, try and find your nearest\ncastell, I promise it won\u2019t be far. I once\nfound one on a golf course.\nBy the way, castell isn\u2019t a misspell-ing, it\u2019s Welsh. Yes, Wales has its own\nlanguage. It\u2019s what everyone used to\nspeak before the English invaded (I\ncan\u2019t remember which time) but now,\nsadly, it\u2019s the reserve of the Gogleddwrau (the people of North Wales) and\nthose know-it-alls who paid attention\nin GCSE Welsh. But I digress. Welsh is\na lovely, musical language, filled with\ngrammatical tomfoolery. For a start,\nwe have more vowels than English,\nbecause we\u2019re bohemian libertines like\nthat. There\u2019s also a few double-letters\nlike ll, ch, ff, in case we need sounds\nthat English people can\u2019t pronounce\n(and not for lack of trying. I spent a\nyear training a captive Englishman,\nnothing).\nOnto the two big Rs: rugby and re-ligion. In Wales, these are one and\nthe same. Though he may be accused\nof being ignorant in many things, a\nWelshman knows his way around\nthree things; a bible, a rugby ball...and\na sheep, of course. These two facets are\nso intimately intertwined, so deeply\ningrained in the Welsh identity that\nthe well-known revival hymn Bread of\nHeaven often echoes round the Millennium Stadium during the pitched battles of the Six Nations. Indeed, the passion behind that anthem far outstrips\nthe paltry quaverings of Jerusalem.\nA word on the geography. There\u2019s\nSouth Wales, where all the shiny, interesting and downright useful stuff,\nlike Doctor Who and my house, for\nexample, may be found. Then there\u2019s\nWest Wales. There are caravans here,\nand puffins, and holiday-homes for\npeople in Surrey to visit on the week-end. Then there\u2019s Mid Wales, which\nis full of mountains. I\u2019m not sure what\nelse is there...it\u2019s quite a \u201chere be dragons\u201d place. And those are real dragons.\nLastly, there\u2019s North Wales. It\u2019s like\nanother country, completely alien in\nevery way. They speak Welsh there...\nproperly, I mean, not just as an easy\nway to chat up women. The only thing\nI can tell you for certain is that they\nhate South Wales with the passion of\na thousand suns. I don\u2019t why...it\u2019s probably because we\u2019re better.\nThe Welsh are a completely downtrodden yet eternally optimistic peo-ple. We\u2019re the underdog of the British...\nand everyone loves an underdog.\nHywl Fawr!\nC\nan\u2019t I put it off for a few\nhours longer?\nNo, I\u2019ve wasted enough\ntime already. Right \u2013 time\nto sit down and finally\nbatter out this week\u2019s comment piece.\nMaybe I should just clean the living\nroom again? Some more dust may have\naccumulated under the sofa in the two\nminutes since I put the vacuum cleaner away... Maybe putting the vacuum\ncleaner away caused more dust to accumulate under the sofa? I\u2019d better go\nand check...\nNo \u2013 I should sit and write.\nMaybe just polish the computer\nscreen one last time...\nNo, No and No. Get a grip on your-self, turn on the computer, mute the\nsound, and open Microsoft Word.\nRight. I\u2019ve opened a new blank document and it just looks so pretty. So\nclean and white \u2013 it\u2019s almost a shame\nto spoil it by writing anything on it.\nAnything short of perfection, that is.\nSo the first line must leap out of the\nstarting blocks like Usain Bolt being\ntasered. It should welcome and arouse\nwith the elegance and charm of Lauren\nBacall putting her lips together and\nblowing. The page should vibrate to\nthe pulsating rhythm of the very first\nFlaubertian mots justes.\n\u201cThere is a fine distinction between\nthe artistic and the artisanal.\u201d\nHm. That might work. At least it\u2019s\nnot actually grammatically incorrect.\nStill, there\u2019s no point in getting this\nworked up over the first sentence, or\nI\u2019ll never get around to writing the second one. That\u2019s what happened to the\nlast few novels I tried to write. Ok, let\u2019s\nmove on.\nCtrl+S.\nOh \u2013 I need to give the document a\nname. \u201cArt and artifice.\u201d Nope. \u201cFlowing through our Arteries.\u201d Hm. Maybe\nI\u2019m better off simply calling it \u201cTerm\n2: Comment II\u201d. That\u2019ll do for the mo-ment. I\u2019ll just write that out at the top\nof the document and then I can move\non. There. Doesn\u2019t that look pretty?\nOK, where was I.\nHold on \u2013 shouldn\u2019t the title be cen-tralised? Give me a moment, I\u2019ll be\nright back. There we go. Maybe ital-ics... and bold font? No, definitely not\n\u2013 far too crass. How about a subtle un-derline? Much better.\nGreat. Back to the text.\nHow about changing the font?\nStop it! I can change the font later.\nOnce I\u2019ve actually written something...\nSo:\n\u201cThere is a fine distinction between\nthe artistic and the artisanal.\u201d\nMaybe that should be:\n\u201cThere is a fine line separating the\nartistic and the artisanal.\u201d\nAha! I know:\n\u201cThe line separating the artistic and\nthe artisanal could be drawn with a 7H\npencil.\u201d Or doesn\u2019t that quite work?\nNever mind, never mind! Keep moving\nforward, that\u2019s the key.\nCtrl+S.\nDo I really want to say \u2018separating\u2019?\nHow about \u2018dividing\u2019? I wonder what\nthesaurus.com has to say about it.\nMight as well open a new browser,\nwait for thesaurus.com to load... Oh\nlook! A new e-mail in my google ac-count. Well, a new e-mail in my spam\nfolder, at any rate. Make that 374 new\ne-mails in my spam folder. I wonder\nwhat procedure my account uses to\nseparate (or should that be divide?)\nbetween spam and genuine e-mails?\nSurely there can\u2019t be an algorithm that\nfaultlessly makes the distinction every\ntime? I mean, I have been expecting\nthat e-mail from the BBC people... It\nsurely wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a quick\nlook.\nHm. No e-mails from the BBC here...\nJust a lot of people looking to sell me\nv1agra. Or viazqa. Or xiagra or even\nvpagja \u2013 whatever that might be.\nOh good \u2013 thesaurus.com is fully\nloaded. \u2018Splitting\u2019 isn\u2019t bad... but \u2018between\u2019 is so much better! Right:\n\u201cThe line between the artist and\nthe artisan could be drawn with a\n7H pencil. The former devises con-cepts, whereas the latter sets up\nconstructions...\u201d\nNo \u2013 \u2018sets up\u2019 is no good. \u2018Builds\u2019?\n\u2018Constructs\u2019? Too clumsy with\n\u2018constructions\u2019.\nI know \u2013 \u2018erects\u2019! Why didn\u2019t I think\nof it before...\n\u201cThe line between the artist and\nthe artisan could be drawn with a 7H\npencil.

The charities are\nhoping to reverse a High Court ruling\nmade last month that that the application for judicial review of the pavement removal project was \u201cpremature.\u201d\nGuide Dogs claims that the plan is\n\u201cdangerous and unlawful.\u201d\nThe charities serve disabled people\nand are concerned about the possible\nsafety implications of the project, particularly for these vulnerable groups.\nIt is not hard to see why some people may be concerned about creating\na zone for joint use by both cars and\npedestrians, especially when the areas\nattracts more than 11 million visitors\na year. The council has sought to alleviate these fears by reminding concerned individuals and groups that the\nboundaries of a pedestrian zone would\nbe clearly marked by a \u201ctactile corduroy delineator\u201d and that traffic will be\nExhibition Road Project opposed by charities\nrestricted to 20mph. Guide Dogs, in\nleading the group of 30 charities in applying for a second High Court hear-ing, responded that tactile boundaries\nare \u201cuntested.\u201d\nIn December, when interviewed by\nfelix, Project Leader, Councillor Nicholas Paget-Brown from the Royal\nBorough of Kensington and Chelsea argued the removal of formal pavements\nwould benefit disabled people.\nHe said, \u201cthe kerb itself is a trip hazard and is not actually an ideal barrier\nfor people with physical disabilities. So\nremoving the kerbs can be very helpful.\u201d\nHe was also certain that guide dogs\nwould be able to distinguish pedestrianised and motorway sections of the\nsurface, stating, \u201cIt is certainly possible\nto train guide dogs to recognize a strip\nof corduroy paving all away up.\u201d\nTom Pey, from Guide Dogs, said:\n\u201cThe council has repeatedly ignored\nour research and representations from\nother organisations, as well as our \u2018Say\nNo to Shared Streets Campaign\u2019 which\nis supported by 30 disability groups.\u201d\nThere is currently academic research\nbeing done on the concept of shared\nzones for use by both pedestrians and\ntraffic. The government has delayed\ngiving advice on the issue until the\nresults of that research are published.\nAn alternative proposal, which has not\nreceived much support, is for Exhibition Road to be closed to traffic during\nperiods of heavy pedestrian use, such\nas during the day and at weekends.\nSina Ataherian\nSina Ataherian News Reporter\nArtist\u2019s impression of what Exhibition Road will look like come 2012.

COINCIDENCE?!\nImperial College ranks top university for LGBT employment\nImperial College London has been\nlisted among Stonewall\u2019s Top 100 Employers 2010 for being one of the top\nemployers of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people. The\nWorkplace Equality Index, released\non 13th January, places Imperial at\nnumber 79 ahead of the only other HEI\n(higher education institution) in the\nlist, Liverpool John Moores University,\nwhich follows at 85.\nRector Sir Keith O\u2019Nions welcomed\nthe news by saying: \u201cImperial\u2019s great\nstrength lies in the people who work\nhere and we can\u2019t afford to let talent go to waste due to ignorance or\nprejudice.\u201d He added: \u201cMaking it into\nStonewall\u2019s Index of Top 100 Employers is a real milestone for us and sends\na strong message that discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation has no\nplace on our campuses and will not be\ntolerated.\u201d Imperial was one of the first\nHEIs to take part in Stonewall\u2019s Diversity Champions Programme which allows employers to work with Stonewall\nin promoting equality for LGBT people in the workplace.\nSince 1989, Stonewall has been a\nprofessional lobby group aimed at preventing the stigmatising and attack of\nLGBT people. Over the years, Stonewall has successfully campaigned on\nnumerous fronts which include lifting\nthe ban on lesbians and gay men serving in the military, as well as helping to\nsecure civil partnerships. Stonewall is\npart of the Equality and Diversity Forum which is a group of organisations\nwith an aim to address and progress\non age, disability, gender, race, religion and belief, and sexual orientation\nissues. In January 2009, Imperial relaunched the staff advisory group Imperial 600 which ensures that all College policies afford the same right to\nLGBT people as everybody else. Rector O\u2019Nions pointed out, \u201cMy thanks\nand congratulations go in particular to\nthe members of Imperial 600 for leading the work that has made this success possible.\u201d\nfelix spoke to Chris Darby who is the\nPresident of IQ, the LGBT society at\nJoanna Cai\nJoanna Cai News Reporter\nImperial. He welcomed the good news\nbut also stressed that although \u201cthis is\nfantastic for the staff, there is a long\nway to go for the student body\u201d. He\nadmitted that if there was to be a Top\n100 list of LGBT-friendly universities,\nImperial might well not feature.\nUnlike the staff advisory group Imperial 600 who received a boost in\nfunds accompanying their relaunch,\nas well as increased efforts towards\nachieving diversity and equality, the\nstudent LGBT community has seen no\nsuch additional support.\nHostility towards LGBT students at\nImperial remains a problem, and Chris\nfeels that the diversity that exists at\nImperial is bittersweet. Issues of race,\ndisability, religion and gender are all\nwidely accepted as deserving equality\nbut according to Chris, there remains a\ncertain \u201ctaboo\u201d associated with sexual\norientation.\nNevertheless, Imperial\u2019s place on\nthe Top 100 Employers list is an official indication that Imperial is striving\ntowards equality for LGBT staff, and\nhopefully the recent efforts among the\nstaff will also be seen within the student community.\nPlease visit www.stonewall.org.uk for\nmore information on their work.

Snow reports had told us that it was going to be\nbloody freezing all week, so after a last\nminute trip to High St. Ken\u2019 for extra\nthermals, we were on our way!\nLuckily for most of us, the coach\njourney flew by, which could have\nhad something to do with the copious amounts of port and whiskey consumed on the ferry. After a pretty uneventful journey (except for the usual\nnakedness, megaphones and puking\n- we all know who\u2019s responsible), we\narrived at Arc 1800 mid-afternoon,\ngrabbed our ski\u2019s from the hire shop\nand - in true Snowsports style - started\ndrinking, again.\nI have to say, the way the trip was going by this point, I felt like I was in for\na bit of a festival experience - partying\nso hard that I didn\u2019t actually do what I\nset out to do, which was to snowboard\nevery day. Yet, as we were comatose in\nour beds after the first night out, the\nheavens opened and gave us an extra\n50cm of snow. Waking up in the morning to so much snow, and snow still\ncoming down, was enough to rid us\nall of our hangovers, and so we were\nout on the slopes! I seemed to be one\nof the only committee members for\nwhom Imperial ski trip was my first\nweek on snow of the season, and the\nboys weren\u2019t going to let me ease myself into it. The first morning meant\nsome serious off-piste powder riding\nand some steep, powdery black runs,\nwhich meant a lot of falling and walking for me!\nLes Arcs is actually a huge ski resort,\nand with the recent addition of the lift\nconnection to La Plagne, a neighbouring resort, the ski area is one of the\nbiggest in the world, with pistes available to all ski levels. But with the fresh\ndump of powder on the first night, the\npistes were not what we were interested in. Following the rest of the com-mittee, with a few extras, I was slightly\nout of my depth in skill level, which I\nrealised when I ended up headfirst in\nthe snow, with two other snowboarders running to pull me out.\nYou would have thought that, after\nplaying in the powder all day, we\u2019d all\nbe far too tired to have another night\nout. But there\u2019s no rest for the wicked,\nand we were back on the lash again -and dressing up, cartoon characters\ntheme. My favourite outfit was a certain Banana-in-Pyjamas, and some\npeople went to a lot of effort; from all-THIS WEEK, CHARLOTTE MORRIS REPORTS ON THIS YEARS JANUARY SKI TRIP ORGANISED BY THE\nIMPERIAL SNOWSPORTS SOCIETY.\nin-one baby-grows (Rugrats) to dying\npeople\u2019s hair purple to look like Leela\nfrom Futurama.\nThe next couple of days were perfect\nskiing conditions, bright blue skies and\nexcellent snow underfoot. We made\nthe most of exploring the resort, which\nhad plenty to offer. My favourite part\nof Les Arcs was in Arc 2000; you could\ntake a gondola up and then a cable car\nright to the top of the mountain. Because the weather was so good, the\nviews from the top were amazing. And\nthe ski down to Arc 1600 was just as\namazing; one long run, with a mixture\nSo if you haven\u2019t managed to get your\nfix of snow this season so far, come\nwith us to BUSC\u2019s Main Event 2010,\nwhich takes place at Alpe d\u2019Huez\nduring the Easter holidays.\nof terrains, from moguls to freshly\ngroomed, wide-open runs, with no lift\nstops all the way to the bottom.\nThe highlight of my evenings has to\nbe the Mountain Meal. For those of\nyou who have never been on an Imperial ski trip, a Mountain Meal is where,\nat the end of a day\u2019s skiing, we met at a\nrestaurant at the top of the mountain.\nWe were given a bottle of wine each\nand ate a very filling meal of cheese\nraclette, a traditional Savoie dish consisting of lots of cheese, with a plate\nof meat (or salad for the vegetarians),\npotatoes and pickled onions. Cheese\nOur holiday in pictures...\nraclette consists of a wheel of Reblochon cheese, cut in half and placed\nunder a grill. You then scrape off the\nlayers of melted cheese and add it to\nyour plate. It\u2019s a very social way to eat,\nand after a bottle of red wine each, we\nwere all a little bit tipsy. So when the DJ\n(a greying, old frenchman) kicked off\nthe disco by playing Daft Punk, it was\nonly a matter of time before we were all\ndancing on the tables in our ski boots.\nDangerous, you might ask? Not as\ndangerous as the \u2018torchlit descent\u2019 af-terwards, which involved us all skiing\ndown to the village, in the dark, only\nlit by a few people who had lanterns of\nfire. Luckily for me, I managed to get\ndown without falling, only stopping to\nlight the way for a group of people who\nhad managed to get themselves tangled\nin the orange safety fencing at the side\nof the piste.\nWith the snow conditions deteriorating after the first dump of snow at\nthe start of the week, it came as a bit\nof a relief that the last day meant more\nsnow. Unfortunately for many people,\nafter the crazy night the night before (it\nwas our last night in the resort - what\ncan I say?) there wasn\u2019t a lot of skiing\nto be done, and a lot more loitering\naround bars in the village, eating pizza\nand kebabs all day.\nWhat impressed me the most about\nthis year\u2019s ski trip was how willing everybody was to get involved. The more\nadvanced skiers and snowboarders\nwere happy to teach the less confident\nones, the freestyle experts were giving tips in the park and people offered\nto wax skis and snowboards and lend\neach other kit when they needed it.\nThis led to such a friendly atmosphere\nwithin the group, which in turn, led to\nlots of fun skiing during the day and\nsome brilliant nights out!\n\n"

Ladies, the game is up. They know the\nGame. They know how to make you\ngo weak in the knees. So don\u2019t say I\nhaven\u2019t warned you. Next time you go\non a date and somebody tells you \u2018nice\nshoes\u2019, take it with a pinch of salt. Or\ngrill him with an in-depth shoe conver-sation. Here, is how:\n1. What do you think of the collaboration between Jimmy Choo and\nUGG?\n2. Oh how do you say his name? That\nFrenchman who designs shoes with a\nred sole...\nTo be honest, 9 times out of 10 the\nman can\u2019t even tell the difference between a pair of pumps and heels. All\nthat matters to them is colour.\nWomen and\nshoes\nKawai Wong\nKawai Wong Fashion Editor\nLast week I braved the weather and\nwore a pair of pointy 2-inch Kurt\nGeiger court shoes for a change (nor-mally? Subzero temperatures? UGG...).\nAfter 12 hours of milling about I could\nno longer meander the last 200 metres\nhome. I phoned my brother...\n\u2018Bring UGG and meet me at blah...\u2019\n\u2018A pair of what?\u2019 \u2018UGG, UGG boots!\u2019\n\u2018What colour is it?\u2019 And the penny\ndropped.\nAnyway, want a pair of good looking court shoes that you can survive\nin? Head to M&S. Their Insolia range\nmoves your weight to the back of the\nheels so the balls on your feet don\u2019t\nache as much as another pair at the\nexact same height. What\u2019s more, the\ninsoles are leather and the bottom is\nwater-resistant. \u00a340. What more can\nyou ask for?\nThe Style Heroines of Our Time\nRihanna\nYou may think that she is vulgar. You\nmay think that with what little clothing she wears, there\u2019s not much style in\nquestion. You have to look outside the\ntabloid images of Rihanna.\nHer screen persona is hard and\nfierce; an alter-ego, the result of being\na victim of domestic violence. She has\ncome a long way since her girl-next-door days when she sang about puppy\nlove and summer breaks.\nRiRi\u2019s success is attributed to her\nbrillant mix of eclectic pieces with soft\ntouches. She is forever bang on trend,\nbut never an avid follower with no\nimagination.\nAt Met Gala 2009, Rihanna executed\nthe masculine D&G suit with 100%\nprecision.\nShe also worked the strong shoulder\ntrend like no other. Be it an LV dolly\nuniform that was worn by Madonna\nand the de rigueur Balmain miltary\njacket from last season... She annihilates the ridicularity of an exaggerated\noutfit matter-of-factly with her hard\nedge confidence.\nAn advocate for all things edgy; neither Decarnin\u2019s rock trash, Gaultier\u2019s\nfetish, Margiela and Pugh\u2019s quirkiness,\nDior\u2019s feminism nor Chalayan\u2019s minimalism will satisfy\nher fashion appetite.\nIn her Hard video, she\nsported Jeremy Scoot\u2019s\nMickey ears helmet and\nthe bullet bra. Alexander\nVaultier\u2019screationfollowed\nher from the streets to her\nvideo. Rihanna\u2019s choice\nof using British designer\nBryce Aime\u2019s spiky T-Rex\ntop from her CSM graduate collection has\nreceived national\nnewspaper\ncoverage.\nShe does no fashion faux pas when it\ncomes to accessorising. The\nfuschia bra under a knit top is\na calculated move to add an\nedge to a comfy outfit. Her\nshades aren\u2019t RayBan. They\nare status glasses from Grey\nAnt; Beyonce is also a fan.\nNothing about Rihanna is\nthe norm; she wore a pair of\nlaced lens glasses by A-Morir\nto spice up a Jasmine di\nMilo sequin playsuit.\nRussian Roulette? Not a\ngame Rihanna plays when\nit comes to fashion.\nLady Gaga\nIs it ironic that I\u2019m writing a fashion\narticle about a woman who resides in\na perpetual state of half dress? Perhaps, but this particular woman has\nhad a profound influence over the\ncouture runways worldwide since her\ndebut last year. Known for her avant-garde, provocative style, Lady Gaga\u2019s\nlatest video, Bad Romance, reads like\na trends list for next spring-summer.\nBetween the various sets of Agent\nProvocateur lingerie and custom designed jewellery, Gaga models a great\nportion of Alexander McQueen\u2019s S/S\n2010 collection \u2013 appropriate, since\nshe chose to debut the single at his\nrecent show in Paris this year \u2013 especially notable for some may be the\ninfamous \u201carmadillo\u201d shoes!\nThough McQueen appears to be\nthe only designer who can feed her\ninsatiable craving for all things ex-traordinary, her influence is seen at\nevery haute couturier worth their salt\n\u2013 Gaultier, Chanel and Lacroix have\nall succumbed to her sartorial power\non their catwalks. However most of\nthe time Miss Gaga\u2019s getups are designed by her elusive young design\nteam, Haus of Gaga, whose collective\nimaginations have created some of the most\nmemorable stage costumes \u2013 and off-stage\ncostumes.\nAn advocate\nfor all things\nunique, outrageous and ri-diculous, Lady\nGaga embodies the fantasy involved\nin fashion \u2013 she\nprovides an\nunexpectedly\nhumorous\ntake on an industry that is\nnotoriously\nelitist, donning\nclothes usually\nreserved only for\nthe catwalk\u2026\nNo, I wouldn\u2019t personally wear any of her out-fits, but I do admire her\n\u2013 she doesn\u2019t just take\nfrom fashion, she gives,\nand generously, providing inspiration and a\nvision that is new, not\njust dredging up what\nwe\u2019ve all seen before.\nAnna Dello Russo\nOne of the grande dames of 21st century fashion, the Fashion Director At\nLarge at Vogue Nippon is one of the\nwomen who, along with Carine Roitfeld, Kate Lanphear and Anna Wintour, form the Editrix Elite \u2013 an implicit\npanel of fashion luminaries who dictate exactly who and what happens in\nfashion today.\nThis is a woman whose fashion acumen has been nurtured by fashion\u2019s\nmost incisive minds. Her style is \u00fcberluxe and full of texture: rich brocades,\nheavy silks, sparkling embellished fabrics and opulent feathers and furs create the foundations of her wardrobe,\nwith all her outfits littered with her signature collection of vintage brooches\nand jewels. All this, plus arguably the\nmost enviable shoe collection amongst\nthe fashion world!\nShe shuns realism, residing in a culmination of impossibilities: criminally\nstylish and incredibly connected, she\nsynthesises hemlines and bottom\nlines atop Kirkwood heels and swans\nthrough Fashion Month in a crimson\nDolce and Gabbana gown paired with\nblack opera-length leather gloves and\npatent YSL Tribute boots at 9am, strapless bejewelled emerald Balmain\nat lunch and sequinned silver and green cutout Pucci\nfor cocktails at 7pm. The\nFashion Editor need not\nbe any more realistic than\nthe makeshift arid\ndesert scene she created for the summer\nswimwear spread.\nAnna Dello\nRusso takes\nfashion out of\nthe ordinary.\nThere is no one\nelse who can convincingly take\nsuch avant-garde\nlooks straight off\nthe catwalk and carry them off with such pa-nache. Completely different from the conservative\nEnglish Wintour, the chic\nFrench Roitfeld and the\nmonochromatic American Lanphear, Dello\nRusso is exactly what\none might expect from\nan Italian \u2013 outrageous,\nflamboyant, and a warm,\nbubbling personality you\ncan almost taste from just one\nphoto.\nThese women inspire designs on the catwalks, of items, and of our\nwardrobes. Saskia Verhagen and Kawai Wong explain.\nThe lights go out. A hush ripples across\nthe audience. I tense in anticipation \u2013\nit is my first fashion show, and with the\ninnocence of a child I await a glimpse\nof Erdem\u2019s creations. Here I am \u2013 the\noutsider in my trackpants and hoodie\n\u2013 worrying that the nuances of fashion\nmay soar over my head.\nSince going solo with his eponymous\nlabel in 2005, Erdem Moralioglu has\nbeen heralded by such luminary organisations such as the British Fashion\nCouncil and Elle as one of the future\ngroundbreakers of the fashion world.\nThe introductory paper I have been\nhanded says that the range of womens-wear I am about to see was nominated\nfor the British Fashion Awards Collection of the Year. The lights snap on and\nthe music starts to play.\nAlthough he has a clear penchant for\nfloral patterns and lacework, Erdem\u2019s\ncreations display a vibrant range of\nstyles. A pristine white gown that invoked memories of Edwardian times\ngives way to a flowing smock reminiscent of the 1960\u2019s. A long dress in\nthe style of the Vietnamese Ao Dai is\nmy personal favourite, the shimmering black taffeta background offering\na beautiful contrast to the red, yellow\nand pink pansies playing across the\nfront.\nThe black lacework for which Erdem\nis famous appears more prominently\non a few plain-coloured dresses, its\nintricacy dovetailing nicely with the\nsedate colours chosen. A selection of\nmodels sport his other speciality, floral\nprints \u2013 a profusion of green, cream,\nred and blue capturing the joie de\nvivre of a summer day. That is not\nto say that his work is flawless \u2013 a\njarring maelstrom of different flowers in a sea of red provides one of\nfew blots on his landscape \u2013 but\nthe subtlety of much of this work is\nelegant.\nThe make-up, done by Andrew\nGallimore, is minimalistic and suits\nthe show perfectly. In fact, this aspect\nserves as a microcosm for the entire\ncollection \u2013 high quality fashion you\ncould picture any girl on the street\nwearing. It is proof that one does not\nhave to be an expert to appreciate fine\ncouture. As in music, drama or litera-ture, something well-crafted appeals to\nexperts and amateurs alike.\nAt the end of a fascinating fifteen\nminutes, the man himself walks out,\naccepting the audience\u2019s applause with\nthe modesty and grace evident in his\nwork.\nThe audience ghosts out to the\nstrains of a violin version of Nirvana\u2019s\nCome as You Are - an unexpected and\nfitting end to a show that has surpassed\nall my expectations.\nErdem\u2019s V&A ShowA Fashion Virgin\u2019s Perspective\nAdityaNarayanan\nAdityaNarayanan\n\n"

His immediate behaviour was\ndescribed as drunkenly aggressive,\nand when he was politely refused permission to use the sofa, he lashed out\nwith his fists at the guest.\nUnderstandably shocked, the guest\nwas led out of the Union building as\nsecurity started the search for the at-tacker. After some first-aid treatment\nto a several-inch long cut above his\nright eyebrow, the guest was interviewed by Union security and stew-ards. He decided to press charges,\nand the police and ambulance were\nsubsequently called. The victim was\nlater taken to hospital.\nCollege staff member\nattacks student\u2019s\nguest at Union\nRoger loved standing in doorways alone whilst his friends went drinking\nThe man arrested has since been\nfound to be a former member of College staff who works in Registry. He\nwas at the Union celebrating his last\nday of work at Imperial.\nThe College Registry regularly deals\nwith student welfare matters including\nadmissions, financial hardships and\nexamination procedures.\nA spokesperson for Imperial stated,\n\u201cImperial regrets to confirm that on\nSaturday 16 January at approximately\n1am, a former member of staff was allegedly involved in a physical assault on\na guest in one of the College\u2019s student\nunion bars. Union staff and stewards\npromptly called an ambulance and the\npolice and administered first aid to the\nvictim, who was subsequently treated\nin hospital for cuts to the face.\n\u201cThe incident is now being investigated by the police, and the College\nhas no further comment to make at\nthis stage.\u201d\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\n\u201cThe situation\nended with the\nattacker being\nescorted into a\npolice car on Prince\nConsort Road.\u201d\nideas, the controversy that could be caused\nis enough for us to raise a flag and so we\nwouldn\u2019t invite them. If the speaker is Muslim, they will understand, it is a well known\naxiom in our religion.\u201d\nAlongside his own judgment, Butt also\nbelieves the healthy relationship he has with\nCollege authorities creates a \u201creally good\nbalance\u201d at Imperial. He adds, \u201cWe\u2019ve got\nthe freedom to operate but they also have\nthe safety procedures such as speaker clearance checks by security. Also, we have such\na close relationship with Andrew Willson,\nthe Chaplain, and Sir Keith O\u2019Nions, the\nRector. We regularly exchange emails. They\ndo keep an eye out on us but its not spying.\nIt\u2019s a healthy exchange of information. If no\none knew about us, and we weren\u2019t doing\nevents, that harbours suspicion.\u201d\nButt also feels the detriment of the public\nattention Muslims have received in the past\ndecade has added another dimension to\nMuslim students wanting to live a politically\npro-active life at university.\n\u201cSome people might hold political views,\nI don\u2019t myself, but we live in a climate that\nif Muslim people are interested in politics,\nand a non-Muslim person is interested in\npolitics, they won\u2019t really be seen the same.\nFor example, if someone disagrees with UK\nForeign Policy, if he\u2019s a Muslim, it\u2019s questioned,\u201d he says.\n*\nSAFETY NETS\nA thought crosses my mind, and I wander\nif he comes across any unprovoked hostility\non campus.\n\u201cNot really personally, there\u2019s an odd post\non a forum here and there and you have to\nlive with that. If you give someone a platform like that, if they have hostile views,\nthey come forward,\u201d he confesses. My mind\nflashes back to Live!, Imperial\u2019s student\nnews website that allows users to post feedback anonymously. What Butt has pointed\nout certainly rings true when it comes to the\nmessage board posts relating to the stories\nof Babar Ahmed\u2019s arrest in 2004. He does\nhowever, encourage people to report any\n\u201cphysical or verbal abuse\u201d, especially if they\nare not confident enough to report it due\nto intimidation. With a cautious smile, presumably of relief, he adds, \u201cAlthough thankfully Imperial isn\u2019t a place where people\nlower themselves to that degree.\u201d Whilst the\nmedia broadly announces that terrorism is\nbeing developed under the safety blanket of\nuniversity campuses, as in Abdulmutallab\u2019s\ncase, Imperial\u2019s campus and community\nis Butt\u2019s own safety blanket away from the\npublic\u2019s spotlight of condemnation. He then\nadds, \u201cBut then there\u2019s still the surrounding\ncommunity.\u201d\n\u201cIf you see it from\nour perspective, the\nvilification of Islamic\nsocieties harbouring\nterrorists is like if\nsomeone went to\nSainsbury\u2019s then\naccused them of\nharbouring terrorism;\nthe link is tenuous.\u201d\nDealing with\ncontroversy\nfelix quizzes Union President Ashley Brown on the\nUnion\u2019s policy regarding guest speakers\nStandpoint of London\u2019s students\n\u201cAs a society, we unequivocally and in very clear terms denounce\nall acts of terrorism and violence regardless of the perpetrator. It is\nimportant to realise that as long as this expression [of extremism]\ndoes not incite violence or break the law, then it should not only be\npermissible but fostered for academic student debate. Never has a\nspeaker invited by the UCL Islamic Society espoused views on campus\nwhich would incite violence or would have broken the law.\u201d\nPresident of the UCL Islamic Society\n\u201cHe preaches every other week and is constantly bringing the subject\naround the need to establish the Caliphate [Islamic state]. Only last\nweek he was talking about the Detroit bomber and saying the guy was\nnot radicalised in London and it was all to do with foreign policy.\nLast year he recommended we should attend a conference which I later\ndiscovered was organised by Hizb ut-Tahrir [a government-monitored\nhardline Islamic group], but he never mentions the party by name.\u201d\nA member of LSE Islamic Society\nRegarding Reza Pankhurst, a regular speaker with radical views\nMojeed Adams-Mogaji, on Abdulmutallab and student extremism\nHow would you come to a decision if a contentious Guest Speaker\nRequest Form was put on your desk?\nGoogle, consultation with the College secretary and Pro-Rector\n(education), or Dean of Students. However, there\u2019s nothing wrong with\nstudents hearing from contentious speakers in fact, university should be a\nplace where people\u2019sviews are challenged. The issue comes where a speaker\ntries to recruit or radicalise.\nHow do you pre-empt a speaker looking to push his extreme beliefs\non students?\nWell, in a lot of cases you can\u2019t tell until they\u2019re here, but there\u2019s not much\nyou can do about that. Unless you want to ask the security services to give\nyou a yay or nay, which a bit too close to an authoritarian government for\nmy liking.\nSurely you have to question the motives of the students inviting such\na speaker in the first place?\nWhat if I decided, say, to invite Nick Griffin to speak? Should the\nassumption be that I\u2019m a big racist, or that I wanted him somewhere where\nhe could prove what a complete cock he is? I would, though, expect a\nresponsible club or society to organise balanced discussions, so if they\nwanted someone with a contentious viewpoint, they had someone there\nto argue against it too.\nWould you not be then concerned that he could get through to even\na tiny percentage of his audience? Even if it was just one person\nbelieving things that would detrimental to society if they were to come\nto fruition.\nBut much like we can tell that Nick Griffin is bad, you can\u2019t tell that about\nsome extremist people. We could just as easily find that one of our clubs had\ninvited someone associated with the BNP that no-one had information on.\nHow would you know? The only way to be absolutely sure is to stop clubs\ninviting external speakers or monitor what all of them say which is clearly\nridiculous. What is important is to maintain a good dialogue with clubs who\nwant to invite speakers who might be considered contentious.\nSo, what\u2019s the solution?\nIf you want to keep universities as places where conventional views are\nchallenged, there isn\u2019t one. Keeping an opening dialogue helps, but things\ncan always slip through. That\u2019s the insanity with the UCL situation.\n\n"

The plans\ninvolve the setting up of a \u201cno fly list\u201d\nto prevent suspected terrorists travelling to the UK and other individuals\nwill be forced to endure more extensive checks. All direct flights between\nthe UK and Yemen are to be suspended indefinitely due to concerns over\nYemeni links to international terrorist organisations. Mr Brown said that\nthe UK faced \u201cactive\u201d terrorist threats\nfrom over the world.\nMr Brown ordered a review of airport security measures following the\nattempted attack on a flight from\nDetroit. This review and further intelligence briefings have led to the\ndevelopment of these plans. Brown\ntold MPs that the government would\nintroduce various measures in order to protect the UK\u2019s borders and\nstrengthen aviation and airport security up to the levels needed in these\ntimes. He said that the Home Office\u2019s\ncurrent watch list of terrorist suspects\nwould be extended and two new,\ncomplementary watch lists are to be\ncreated.\nA list of those individuals banned\n\u2013 the \u201cno-fly list\u201d \u2013 will deal with the\ngreater threats to national security\nand a further list of individuals under\nsuspicion will be used to subject those\nto \u201cspecial measures\u201d and more extensive screening before being allowed to\ntravel to the UK.\nBy the start of next year all UK airports and ports should be covered by\nthe e-borders scheme which allows\ninformation that passengers provide\nwhen initially purchasing tickets to be\nchecked against the watch lists. Mr\nBrown stated that improved interna-Politics Editor\nIraq inquiry warms up for Blair\nTony Blair will be called to give evidence for the Iraq inquiry on 29th\nJanuary. The Iraq inquiry, otherwise\nknown as the Chilcot inquiry, was set\nup by Gordon Brown to investigate\nthe British involvement in the Iraq\nwar, and has so far called in several\nprominent figures \u2013 though none as\nimportant as the then Prime Minister,\nMr Blair.\nMany people regard the Iraq war as\nbeing illegal \u2013 the conclusion of a recent inquiry in the Netherlands, so the\n6 hour grilling of the man who took the\nnation to war, against the wishes of the\nmajority of the British public, should\nprove interesting. So many people\nwant to see what could prove to be a\ntruly important moment in history\nthat a ballot was set up to get seats in\nthe audience at the enquiry, though the\nnumber of applicants is far fewer than\nmight be expected if Mr Blair were to\ngo on trial as the war criminal so many\nof us suspect him to be.\nIn the run up to the star attraction,\nthe inquiry has been warming up on\nsome of the others involved in taking\nthe country to war. Alistair Campbell,\nthe Labour spin doctor, successfully\nspun his way out of embarrassment.\nWhen questioned about why Blair\nwent to war his response was that\n\u201cBlair was somebody who fundamentally believed that unless the world\nconfronted Saddam Hussein at that\ntime\u2026 then there would be a bigger\nday of reckoning later and I think he\nstill believes that\u201d.\nWhat everyone else in the world\nnegatively refers to as regime change,\nAlastair Campbell is proud of his in-volvement, and believes that all of Britain should feel the same. He defended\n\u201cevery word\u201d of the 2002 dossier that\nmade all the spurious claims about\nweapons of mass destruction. Apparently it could have been \u201cclearer\u201d, but\ndid not \u201cmisrepresent\u201d the evidence.\nThe claim that Saddam Hussein\ncould mobilise weapons in 45 min-James Lees\nJames Lees\n179 dead\nThe number of British soldiers who\ndied in the Iraq war. The inquiry seeks\nto understand why they were sent to\nwar and will soon call Tony Blair \u2013 the\nman who ultimately took the decision\nto take the country to war.\n29th January\nThe day Tony Blair will face 6 hours of\nquestioning on why he took Britain\nto war in Iraq, whether he misled the\npublic and the legality of the war.\n\u201c...unless the world\nconfronted Saddam\nHussein at that\ntime... there would\nbe a bigger day of\nreckoning\u201d\nBrown may face the inquiry soon\nGeoff Hoon never shot anybody\nCampbell wanted to go to war\nBlair, soon to serve as a witness at the Chilcot inquiry on why he took us to war\nutes is one of these things that could\nhave been made \u201cclearer\u201d according\nto Mr Campbell, who insists that the\nclaim was only to do with battlefield\nmunitions.\nThis is also the line that Geoff Hoon,\nwho was Defence Secretary at the time\nof the Iraq invasion, is taking about the\n45 minute claim. So that\u2019s two of the\npeople involved who have wriggled\nout of the claim. Mr Blair should not\nfind it so easy though; the way he presented the information did not leave\nParliament with the impression that\nthe claim was only to do with battlefield munitions.\nIndeed, why would he use that evidence to persuade Parliament? 45\nminutes is actually a long time for the\nleader of the country to have battlefield weapons ready. Hoon also took\nthe opportunity to have a quick stab at\nGordon Brown, suggesting that Brown\nhad hampered the planning and funding of the war.\nUntil very recently it had seemed\nthat Brown would not be appearing\nbefore the inquiry prior to the general\nelection, though in Prime Minister\u2019s\nquestions on Wednesday he yielded\nthat he would appear before the inquiry whenever he was called.\nThe panel is expected to publish its\nfindings late 2010 or early 2011. However, unless George Bush is called, it\nis unlikely that anything will prove\nmore interesting than the 29th, and\nthe events of that day will be reported\nrapidly after the event.\nBrown announces\nnew anti-terror plans\nJames Goldsack\nJames Goldsack tional co-operation will lead to suspect individuals, including those in\ntransit between flights, to be subject\nto additional checks against the watch\nlist 24 hours before boarding a flight\nto, or via, the UK.\nThe new measures would ensure\nthat individuals \u201cposing the greatest\nrisk\u201d could not travel to the UK, while\nterrorist movements would be \u201cseamlessly tracked and disrupted\u201d said\nGordon Brown.\nMr Brown, who said he had discussed the measures with US President Barack Obama on Tuesday, also\nannounced that the controversial new\nfull body scanners will be introduced\nin airports across the UK next week.\nThe Conservative Party welcomed\nthe new measures and the introduction of a \u201cno-fly list\u201d but went further,\ncalling for a specialist border police\nforce to ensure higher levels of security are reached.

This success was repeated\nin the second match against Bristol\n3 with Victor\u2019s 5\u20131 win against Dominic Knight and Kwan\u2019s 5\u20133 win over\nEoghan Beamish. With such swift vic-tories, Imperial proceeded to play the\ngroup winners match against defending champions Warwick, unfortunately losing 2\u20130 despite Kwan\u2019s 3\u20132 lead\nover Matthew Bradley in the uncompleted final rubber.\nNevertheless, this performance ensured Imperial\u2019s spot in the elimination round of the Team Championship, played after a further 2\u20131 loss\nagainst York 2 in the inconsequential\nfinal group match.. Playing for a place\nin the quarters, Imperial contested a\nnail-biting showdown against Aston\n1. Victor lost 5\u20133 against Pritesh Patel\nwhile Behnam beat Frank Deng 5\u20133.\nThis meant that it all rested on the\nshoulders of Kwan. In a match watched\nby dozens, he and Aston\u2019s Amish Patel were on the hill at 4\u20134, with Kwan\nrequiring just one more foul to exercise the rare three consecutive foul\nrule, which would force the opponent\ninto conceding the rack and hence the\nmatch. Unfortunately, this was not to\nbe and Imperial suffered a 5\u20134 defeat\nto bow out of the competition.\nAlthough disappointed as our team\nhad a real shot at medals this year, we\ndid improve upon last year\u2019s perform-ance, and we will endeavour to put in\nmore practice to bring back medals\nfrom the BUCS-UPC Eight-ball Pool\nChampionships in February. Team trials for this will take place on Wednesday 27 January and everyone is wel-come! Just contact snooker@ic.ac.uk\nMedals escape\nIC pool players\nContinued from back page\nOn Tuesday this week David Attoub,\na prop forward for the flamboyant Parisian team Stade Francais, was given\na 70-week ban for eye gouging, while\nteam mate Julien Dupuy was banned\nfor 23 weeks for the same offence. The\nrecipient of both men\u2019s attention was\nUlsterman Stephen Ferris, attacked\nduring a hotly contested Heineken cup\ngame in December. Both players denied gouging even in the face of photographic evidence, having the audacity\nto claim the evidence may have been\nedited by the Irish photographer. Stade\nFrancais president, Max Guazzini, has\nbeen more than vocal with his views of\nthe incident and subsequent bans even\ngoing as far to say that it is \u2018anti-French\u2019.\nThe length of bans had been reviewed over the summer after the\nabysmal handling of similar gouging\nincidents involving Sergio Parisse and\nSchalk Burger where both men were\nsentenced to just an 8 week ban each.\nGouging is seen to be the most damaging action for the reputation of rugby;\nuse of performance enhancing drugs is\nvery rare, aside from a few isolated in-cidents. Professional rugby players are\nperceived to be elegant, unspoilt men,\nunlike their football counterparts.\nHowever parents will understandably\nbe reluctant to allow their children to\nplay a sport which gouging is a part\nof. As a result the International Rugby\nBoard felt it necessary to clamp down\non offenders, although why it has taken\nquite so long remains a mystery. Gouging is a cowardly and unsportsmanlike\nact and has no place in the game and in\naddition the pros surely outweigh the\ncons for performing a gouge on an op-ponent; there is no obvious advantage\ngained from gouging and if seen by the\nreferee a yellow or more appropriately\na red card will be brandished almost\ncertainly damaging the offender\u2019s\nchances of securing victory. Furthermore, television evidence can be used\nto find offenders once the\ngame has finished.\nThe implementation of lengthy bans\ncoupled with better than ever video\nequipment is seen to be the greatest deterrent to those who do gouge\ntheir opponents. Only time will tell if\nit works.\nUltimately the reputation of rugby\nand the players are the ones who suffer as a consequence of this underhand\naction: Dupuy would have been named\nin Marc Lievremont\u2019s French squad for\nthe six nations, announced yesterday.\nHowever in his absence others will\nnow be able to showcase their talents;\nDupuy may rue the decision but can\nblame no one but himself.\nAlternatively, Schalk Burger, the\nSpringbok flanker, grappled with Luke\nFitzgerald\u2019s eye socket within the first\n30 seconds of the second Lions test this\nsummer. Although the assistant referee witnessed the event, Burger was\ninexplicably given just 10 minutes in\nthe sin bin instead of being dismissed\nfrom the field of play. Had Burger\nbeen correctly sent off, the Springboks\nwould probably not have won the second test and the lions tour that nearly\nwas could have ended up with a different outcome. After the second test, the\nSouth African coach Peter de Villiers\nincredulously defended his player\u2019s\nactions much to astonishment of the\nrugby world.\nAttoub\u2019s ban is the second longest to\nbe given out for the offence since the\ngame turned professional, the length\nis greater than that of Dupuy\u2019s due to\nprevious records of ill discipline and\nthe fact Attoub pleaded not guilty to\nthe citing charges. The ban runs until\nwwwApril 2011 and with the game of\nrugby continuing to evolve at such a\nrate, a yearlong ban could be too long\nfor a player to come back to playing at\nthe top level.\nThe authorities have recognised that\naction must be taken and have begun\nto put in place the measurements to\nkeep the rugby game clean and preserve the gentleman\u2019s game. The tragedy is that they shouldn\u2019t have to.\nCrackdownongougingin\nattempttocleanuprugby\u2019simage\nthe Reading goalkeeper.\nReading gradually regained possession and after a few lukewarm op-portunities, they restored their 3-goal\nadvantage in a manner similar to that\nof the first goal. Imperial were again\ncaught out in the middle and the Reading striker worked well to drag the centre backs out of their position to and\nwas rewarded with a well-taken finish.\nImperial didn\u2019t give up and again created some chances with dynamic play\nfrom Matthieu Vallin and Nathan Ferrol, to no avail.\nReading completed their scoring\nwith another counter attack, taking\nadvantage of the fatigue of the outfield\nplayers and us the wings to stretch\nImperial and then deliver a low cross\nwhich was met by the Reading striker.\nThe game was played out and the\ngame ended 5-1 to the favourites. Cup\nmatches often yield surprises but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t to be for Imperial\nwho were against a team who scored 5\nof the 6 chances they created. If Imperial are to rise up a notch and secure\npromotion into Reading\u2019s league, the\ndiscipline and concentration will need\nto improve over the 90 minutes, as will\nclinical ability of all members of the\nteam.\nA surprise did occur on the adjacent pitch in another 3rd round BUCS\ncup tie between Imperial\u2019s 2nd XI and\nLSE\u2019s 3rd XI. Questions were raised after a number of LSE players emerged\non the pitch with \u20181st/2nd team\u2019 emblazoned on their tracksuits. Imperial\nwent on to lose 2-1 and diminished the\nhopes of Imperial being represented in\nthe last 16 of the cup.\nThe 1st XI nevertheless move on, and\nconcentrate on aiming for promotion\nin the BUCS league and aiming for the\nfinal in the ULU Challenge Cup, with a\npromising quarter final against an as-yet-unbeaten SOAS side tomorrow.\nReading dump\nICUAFC out of\nBUCS cup\nNo, we\u2019d never seen a red, Coca-Cola sponsored pool table before either.\nContinued from back page\nDavid Wilson Sports Editor\n\n"

    "content": "JJ are a little known Swedish band who released a little known album called\nNo. 2 last year. Despite getting an 8.6 rating on Pitchfork, it somehow evaded\nalmost every other music publication. It is pure ambient pop loveliness with\ninfluences from tropicalia to gangsta rap. One of their songs is a slowed down\ndreamy cover of Lil Wayne\u2019s \u201clollipop\u201d with the lyrics changed to an ode to\nMDMA. JJ are a bit of a mystery; they never play live, and you won\u2019t find a\nsingle picture of them on Google. Pretty much everyone I\u2019ve played this album\nto thinks it sucks, but I stand by its strength as bringing the sound of \u201890s twee\nindie pop into the future. This is a slap in the face of anyone who thinks pop\nmusic is all un-original mass produced noise pollution.\n14 felix FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010\nMUSIC\nMusic Editors:\nMusic Editors: Alexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nAlexandra Ashford, Kadhim Shubber & Luke Turner\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nOnline Editor: Christopher Walmsley\nmusic.felix@gmail.com www.felixmusic.tk\nThe felix office\u2019s own\nSound of 2010\nNever mind what the BBC, Mixmag, or Kerrang thinks, here\u2019s\nwhat we like the sound of this year and think has been overlooked\nby most of the music press.\nAlex Ashford\u2019s choice JJ\nThe Strange Boys are a garage rock band from the musical mecca that is Austin,\nTexas. Formed in 2001, they released a series of EPs before finally recording\ntheir debut 2009 album \u201cThe Strange Boys and Girls Club\u201d with the recently\ndeceased Jay Reatard. I can\u2019t really claim to know whether they\u2019ll be huge or\nnot, but their timeless guitar melodies and strained, to point of breaking, vocals\ncome together to form the kind of Southern drawl rock that you\u2019d want to hear\non a road trip through the Deep South. A few tracks and harmonica solos into\ntheir latest album \u201cBe Brave\u201d and I was hooked. They\u2019ve signed to Rough Trade\nfor their second album so perhaps at least a few people will be talking about this\nband in the coming months.\nKadhim Shubber\u2019s choice The Strange Boys\nInexplicable in a way that will blow your mind, if you thought music now is ge-neric, think again. Meeting at art school in Edinburgh, this Scottish four-piece\nare drawing huge attention to themselves. Trying to describe Django Django\u2019s\nsound is an art, even in their own words, the music is, \u201cThe triple distilled essence (and sensibility) of an artistic huddle of mischievous musicals\u201d. How I see\nit, the lack of words to summarize what these wild tribesmen do is a compliment to their creativity. I would say that it is a nonsense mix of instruments and\nelectronics intertwined, a primeval tendency to beat inanimate objects and the\nflare of red-indian chanting vocals. It is safe to say that they are far from aver-age, which is what I hope the music of 2010 will be.\nLuke Turner\u2019s choice Django Django\nIn 2010, King Charles will bridge the gap between the indie-pop movement of\n2007 and the folk movement of 2009. After a year of sing-alongs and waving\nlighters, the devout fans of Mumford & Sons and Fleet Foxes will probably appreciate the jump-start to their legs as they itch for a dance.\nHe\u2019s a showman with a guitar and he has an abiding penchant for any kind\nof music that he can make glorious noise with, from cappella operatics to sea\nshanties.\nWith only one E.P. to his name so far, his imposing hair and noble title will\nprobably be moving upwards on this year\u2019s festival bills after performing on\nGlastonbury 2009\u2019s \u2018Introducing\u2019 stage.\nI reckon he\u2019ll make some noise this coming year, how loud I\u2019m not sure.\nDan Wan\u2019s choice King Charles\nI\u2019m excited. As the information and technology age expands, there is simply more and more of everything and more and\nmore of everything mixed together. You want music that\u2019s a hypnotic mix of dubstep, old school house, and UK garage\nby a guy named after an American songwritting legend? You got it, Joy Orbison is there. You want pop singers who\ndress like robotic disco balls from the future and carry teacups around? You got it, Lady GaGa. You name the blend of\nmusical elements and you will find it. Sadly this also means even more of I\u2019m-literally-just-waiting-to-die-because-I\u2019mtoo-boring-to-kill-myself burblings and croonings of Michael Buble and the X-Pop-Talent-Factor battery hens. Maybe\nin 2010 we can look forward to hearing Hannah Montana feat. Hadouken! remixed by Major Lazer. I can only dream.\nYour Sound of 2010\nWe asked people who\u2019ve written for us in\nthe past to tell us what they think should\nbe looked out for this year.\nThis lo-fi, chilled out, glitchy electronic\ndance-pop is just the kind of music you\ncan float along to without caring about\nthe rest of the world. The dreamy vocals sooth your soul and the languid\nguitar solos have a relaxing quality. Already held in high regard by Pitchfork\nand currently doing his first UK tour;\ndon\u2019t let the fact that he needs a good\nshower detract from the quality of the\nmusic. \u2013 Tom Jennings\nMemory Tapes\nThis band are of the \u2018supergroup\u2019 varie-ty, containing producer-extraordinaire\nDangermouse and James Mercer of\nindiepop group The Shins. Dangermouse is most famous for combining\nJay-Z and The Beatles on The Black\nAlbum, being one half of music duos\nGnarls Barkley and DANGERDOOM,\nas well as producing albums for Beck\nand Gorillaz. Their debut album is\ndue in March and they promise to be a\nmelancholic and psychedelic pop mix.\n\u2013 Tom Jennings\nBroken Bells\nWith their second album Stolen Magic\ndue in March, Rolo Tomassi will be exploding more minds than ever. Possibly\nthe most entrancing live performance\nin the history of the world, the goddess that is Eve Spence will turn even\nthe most dull brained popster into a\nraving fan of the insanity that is math-core. These Sheffield kids\u2019 fragmented\nand synthed-up sound is a kick in the\nface to everything you believed about\nmusic. And by God is it time. \u2013 Kate\nSmith\nRolo Tomassi\nProg. rockers Antlered Man, mix wistful melodies and heavy guitar riffs with\ndelightful ingenuity, producing fresh\nand dynamic material. The lead vocals,\nstrained and emotive, are enhanced by\nthe softer backup, further enriching\nthe sound. Although still unsigned and\nwithout a debut, these guys are sure for\nsuccess for the simple fact that their\nmusic is fascinating and unlike anything that was on the market in 2009.\n\u2013 Kate Smith\nAntlered Man\nAfter the massive success of Tik Tok\nin 2009, her debut album Animal is\nsure to be a massive hit. The next two\nsingles, Blah Blah Blah (ft. 3oh3!) and\nYour Love Is My Drug, are amazingly\ncatchy pop tunes, and with her personal links to Britney and Flo-Rida, she\u2019s\nsure to be an artist to watch. \u2013 Matthew Stringer\nKe$ha\nOK, so you\u2019ve heard about Glee, it\u2019s a\nTV show, not an artist, BUT: here\u2019s the\nlink.\nThe songs from Glee are SO incredible that they\u2019ve been all over the US\nchart, and 4 Glee songs will chart in\nthe top 30 this week in the UK. With\ncovers of Rihanna, Jordin Sparks, The\nRolling Stones, Journey, Kanye and\nmany more, the Glee kids are transforming classic songs from chart his-tory, and making them a hell of a lot\nbetter.\nSo watch Glee on E4 on Mondays,\nand watch their songs climb the charts\nin 2010. \u2013 Matthew Stringer\nGlee Cast\nYup, that\u2019s right, she\u2019s back, and bigger and better than ever. The first\nsingle Louboutins is an RnB/Pop classic if ever I\u2019ve heard one. \u2013 Matthew\nStringer\nJennifer Lopez\nMemory Tapes album artwork. I think it\u2019s pretty.\n\n"

But then again\nI am a massive fan of psychological\nmaiming. In the past it has regularly\nproved to be highly successful.\nMoving on from maiming the general public, this week the Union has\nfinally got round to installing the new\nUnion Bar\u2019s Dignity Drainpipe. In\na risky manoeuvre, Union President\nAshley Brown decided that too many\npeople were simple throwing their dignity away to anyone who happened to\nbe in the bar drinking. Or vomiting.\nOr pissing- got to cover all the bases,\nthe Rugger Bugger boys may be in. So,\nafter a colossal fuck-up which saw College confuse Boris with a few diversion\nsigns, thus sending him to the wrong\nbar, Ashley stepped in to unveil the\nnew Dignity Drainpipe.\nStanding on a table (fucking health\nand safety brap!), in the bar, packed\nwith sportsmen, on Wednesday night\nAshley went mental. He started to\nscream at people like some sort of desperate paedophile \u2018I am the President\ngive me your dignity. You common\nscum! I run this fucking place.\u2019 At first\nhe received some strange looks, which\nfor Mr Brown, is not unusual. But after a while the \u2018common scum\u2019 realised\nthat what Ashley was doing was in fact\nbeing the first contributor to his new\nventure. Adding to the funeral pyre of\ndignity, a Rugby fresher mistook Ashley\u2019s rambling for some sort of sexual\ninvitation. At this point Brown realised\nthat he was probably a) making limited sense and b) a bit twatted. He took\nhimself home, not to resurface until\nlunchtime the following day.\nIn other news, Haiti appears to have\nbeen fucked by a giant horse-come\n-stallion.

    "content": "S\nhockwaves of anger and relief\nreverberated across the world\non Christmas Day 2009 on the\nnews of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab\u2019s failed bombing of\nNorthwest Airlines Flight 253, en route\nfrom Amsterdam to Detroit.\nAs news reports covered Boxing Day\u2019s press,\nit was revealed that he was an Engineering\ngraduate of University College London (UCL),\nand during his time there, became President\nof the university\u2019s Islamic Society.\nAbdulmutallab became the fourth Islamic\nSociety President in London to be arrested\nin four years, and with this latest case being\nso high-profile, it is only inevitable that student Islamic societies are increasingly subject to the media\u2019s magnifying glass.\n*\nTERRORISM AT IMPERIAL?\nImperial is one of the closest universities to\nUCL, both academically and geographically,\nand in 2005 was listed by the Guardian as\none of the many UK universities that had\nextremist groups operating within its ranks.\nThis came after Babar Ahmed, a member\nof College IT staff was accused of having detailed plans for attacking a US warship on\nhis personal computer. Ahmed was arrested\nin 2004 and remains behind bars without a\nconviction to this day; he currently stands\nas the longest detained-without-trial British\ncitizen whilst fighting a court case to prevent his extradition to the USA.\n*\nTHE \u2018IRRESPONSIBLE\u2019 MEDIA\nIn light of recent events, felix spoke to Islamic Society President, Salman Butt, and\nasked him how the media\u2019s attention on\nstudent Islamic societies has changed his\nexperience as the leader of what he believes\na peaceful and open society.\nHe is seemingly most perturbed by how\nthe \u2018irresponsible\u2019 national media are portraying student societies like his, and what\nimpression that gives to the public.\n\u201cIslamic Society at Imperial is very different to the media\u2019s impression of us, that it is\na breeding ground for terrorism and there\u2019s\nstrange things going on. But if you have a\nclose look at any Islamic society at any uni-versity, you\u2019ll find they\u2019re just normal people\nas such and they\u2019re not up to any mischief.\u201d\nHe is very understanding of the situation\nhe finds himself in, but realises the potential\ndetriments it might bring the society.\n\u201cIts quite funny but when you think about\nit, if that\u2019s the only exposure people are get-ting, people get scared. The sad thing is parents might tell their children not to come to\nus and not get involved. That just leads to\nthem being loners and not being incorporated into the community at Imperial.\u201d\n*\nIMPARTIAL IMPERIAL\nThe week after Abdulmutallab\u2019s failed bomb\nattempt, Anthony Glees, Professor of Security and Intelligence studies at the University\nof Buckingham was quoted as saying that \u201call\nBritish universities must look at their Islamic\nSocieties and demand assurances that no\nradicalisation will be allowed. If they can\u2019t give\nthose assurances, they should be disbanded.\u201d\nAfter hearing the argument, Butt takes\ntime to consider his immediate thoughts,\nand is eventually inconclusive. Demanding\nassurances that nothing questionable is going on within a society is not as clear-cut as\nProfessor Glees demands.\n\u201cI find it difficult to prove that someone\nisn\u2019t breeding radicalisation, because how\ncan you prove something doesn\u2019t exist, how\ncan you assure someone that nothing is hap-pening? You have to show something is happening as the opposite, or otherwise?\u201d\nWe move onto matters closer to home, and I\nask how he\u2019d deal with members of the society\nthat harboured views that wouldn\u2019t hold well\nin the public eye. I get the impression that he\nhas encountered such perspectives, but they\nare not ones that he particularly shares.\nWhen I ask him if he thinks that extremist\nviews are flying under his radar, and hence\nalso the College\u2019s, he states that he sees the\nIslamic Society as place for dialogue and a\nsource of advice. He feels that it is not his, or\nthe society\u2019s, place to shut anyone\u2019s mouth by\nforce, including one that may be spitting nails.\n\u201cI don\u2019t condemn people for having certain\nviews or opinions, but if there were radical\nopinions like that, we would discuss them.\u201d\nEven though Imperial College Union have\nlittle in the way of a political agenda, free-speech is traditionally important for students\u2019 political weight in society. Butt recognizes this and reiterates his standpoint.\n\u201cThat is what university is about, we can\u2019t\njust force these people to hide their views\nand go underground; everyone has an opin-ion. It\u2019s not a sin or anything to have one\nopinion,\u201d he says. He makes the point that it\nis not a matter of wrong or right, but difference in opinion. I feel he\u2019d make an excellent\npolitician, and there is something to admire\nas he avoids demonizing people with extremist views, just like the British press have\ndone, but never gives the impression that he\nagrees with these views either. It is almost\nlike he is caught in two minds over defending his fellow Muslims and condemning\ntheir views and actions, which are deemed\nwidely unacceptable to have. However, he\nstrikes a fine balance in doing both.\nHe states, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we should\nharbour any ill feelings towards anyone that\ndoesn\u2019t agree with us on certain issues. Everyone should have the right to have an opinion\non certain atrocities that have happened, as\nlong as they don\u2019t break the law doing it. That\u2019s\na whole different kettle of fish.\u201d\nHis open-mindedness is not something he\nfeels national authorities are appreciating.\nAs he talks, he is obviously frustrated by the\nfact that national authorities, the media and\nhence the public are taking a such a heavy\nhand in their dealings with suspicious student societies. To prove a point, he likens\nthe Islamic society to any other society at\nImperial on several occasions, and you can\nsee why he does it. The term \u2018Islamic society\u2019 carries an unfavourable stigma, and replacing the description \u2018Islamic\u2019 with something like \u2018knitting\u2019 serves the argument\nextremely well.\n\u201cSomeone could use an Islamic society, or\neven a baking or knitting society to promote\nany agenda,\u201d he jovially answers when I ask\nhim if extremists are using student societies\nas platforms for promoting dangerous beliefs.\n*\nUNDER THE MAGNIFYING GLASS\n\u201cPeople in Islamic societies are now those\nwho get the finger pointed at them in the\nmedia,\u201d he sighs. \u201cA lot of members of Islamic societies may get arrested and get\ncharged under certain anti-terror rules that\nwe have in this country, unfortunately. That\ndoesn\u2019t mean they are actually terrorists or\nhave committed anything.\u201d The mention of\nBabar Ahmed is lingering in the air. He is\nquite clearly famous for all the wrong rea-sons, and his strong connections with Imperial College, the institution we are both sitting within, suddenly gives the conversation\na very realistic twist.\n\u201cThere are so many people in prison without having a sentence put on them such as\nBabar Ahmed, from Imperial. He\u2019s still in\nprison and hasn\u2019t been convicted of any-thing. I know it\u2019s because there\u2019s an atmosphere of fear and so on, but when it comes\nto Islamic societies there is obviously a lens\nwhich people look at Muslims through.\u201d\nThe metaphorical idea of a lens which\nthe public think they have the right to look\nat Islam through resonates greatly with me.\nThere is no reason to distrust an honest man\nlike Butt, but yet people are inspecting\nothers just like him a bit too closely. \u201cI\nknow several people whose houses have\nbeen raided for no reason and haven\u2019t been\ncharged. They\u2019re just regular people\nlike you and me.\u201d\nThroughout our 40-minute conver-sation, Butt is eager to push the idea\nof criminal activity, not just terrorism,\naway from student societies like his at\nImperial. His point is that just because\nthe guilty party is part of his society does\nnot mean the society is guilty.\n\u201cIf you see it from our perspective, the\nvilification of Islamic societies harbouring\nterrorists is like if someone went to Sainsbury\u2019s and then accused them of harbouring\nterrorism; the link is tenuous. We don\u2019t train\npeople to go break the law! If someone commits a crime, it\u2019s upon them. They\u2019re also at\nImperial, live in London, shop at a certain\nplace, are part of a certain mosque and part\nof a certain society, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve\nbeen influenced by all of these things to do\nsomething.\u201d\n*\nWHO\u2019S RESPONSIBLE?\nMany fear that a way student extremists are\ninfluencingotherswiththeirradicalbeliefsis\nvia the invitation of guest speakers to events\nheld by student societies. In 2008, Imperial\nsaw a fiasco unfold as ex-Malaysian Prime\nMinister, Mahathir bin Mohamad visited\nImperial on the invitation of Political & Philosophical Society. His controversial opinions as a terrorism-sympathiser sparked off\nmany security and censorship concerns, and\nit ended with a high-up College authority\nbanning all external media and attendance\nfrom the event twenty minutes before it was\ndue to commence. UCL have been criticised\nby the media for not monitoring their students\u2019 activities, namely Abdulmutallab\u2019s,\nclosely enough, including the guest speakers\nhe invited as part of a now well-publicised\nWar on Terror week he helped organise.\nSince Mahathir bin Mohamad\u2019s visit, College and the Union screen any guest speaker\ninvited to the university. Students must have\na Guest Speaker Form approved by security\nbefore their event planning can proceed. I\nasked Butt what he thought of the protocols\nused by College, and the pride of his response almost renders it a statement.\n\u201cI guess they\u2019re effective. We\u2019ve never had\nany problem. Our society\u2019s axiom of everything we do is to prevent any harm before\nyou attain any benefit. This is something\nfrom Islamic principles that we encourage.\nSo if there is a speaker that was deemed\ncontroversial, though there might be a benefit bringing him in, regarding freedom of\nspeech and he may have some good ideas,\n4 felix FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS\nDAN WAN SPEAKS TO ISLAMIC\nSOCIETY\u2019S PRESIDENT, SALMAN BUTT,\nABOUT THE SPOTLIGHT THAT UCL\u2019S\nDETROIT BOMBER HAS BROUGHT\nNOT WHO\nYOU THINK\nWE ARE\n\u201c...there is obviously\na lens which people\nlook at Muslims\nthrough.\u201d\nTop: Islamic\nSociety\nPresident,\nSalman Butt\nsays, \u201cThe\nFriday sermon\nis in the Union\nBuilding\n(pictured)!\nEverything\u2019s\nout in the\nopen.

Their sound is of guitars,\nkeyboards and cowbells. The songs are\nfull of unbeatable hooks and intelligent\nlyrics, sang by all members in a complex whirlwind of vocal melodies and\nharmonies. Tellison make a humble\nkind of indie-rock; this is a refreshing\nchange, and every song on this album\nis worthy of being a hit. - Luke Turner\nThe debut album from this 10-piece\ntheatrical orchestra is characterised by\nsweeping piano and strings arrange-ments. It could potentially be gentle,\nsoothing background music if the singer\ndidn\u2019t fluctuate between a low Antony\nHegarty-type voice and piercing falset-to. The vocals are definitely an acquired\ntaste and the band are at their best on\nsongs where their erratic and creative\nuse of orchestral sounds isn\u2019t overshadowed by the vocals. - Tom Jennings\nTHE\nIRREPRESSIBLES\nMIRROR MIRROR\nV2 COOP\nALBUM\nTELLISON\nCONTACT!\nCONTACT!\nGRAVITY DIP\nALBUM\nGUCCI MANE\nSPOTLIGHT (FT.\nUSHER)\nWARNER BROS.\nSINGLE\nWhatever happened to Usher? Did he\never come out as gay or was that just a\nrumor? Honestly, if a really openly gay\nand camp rapper came out they would\nhave that whole untapped market cor-nered.

It\u2019s\nalso the name of his zine. Cranking apparently means crying and wanking at\nthe same time. If you didn\u2019t know that,\nyou can add it to your subgenres of\nwanking along with shanking (wank-ing in the shower) and danger wanking\n(wanking in a situation where you are\nlikely to get caught). This song is kind\nof a joke, and for a joke, it\u2019s a kind of an\nokay song. - Alex Ashford\nCharged with anger and grit, this album is for trudging through rain and\nmud, it will induce ferocity. It shows\nglimmers of great rock at the beginning\nto most tracks which then sinks away\ninto a thundering, quite unimaginative,\nwall of distortion. It\u2019s an album of two\nparts, one being considerably more\nself-indulgent than the other. This music would be absolute heaven to play at\nfull volume, but not half as fun to listen\nto I\u2019m afraid. - Luke Turner\nTENEBROUS\nLIAR\nJACKKNIFED &\nSLAUGHTERED\nTENOR VOSSA\nALBUM\nBEN RAYNER\nCRANKING TO\nSONIC YOUTH\nREAL GOLD\nSINGLE\nA flash of fluttering voices and 80\u2019s\nstyle groove.

The odd song\nturning easy-listening quite repetitive\nbut magically saved by the occasional\nbrass flare and disco vibe that keeps the\nalbum diverse. Using clever manipulation of a sweet voice gives this album a\ngenuinely different feel. - Luke Turner\nLINDSTR\u00d8M &\nCHRISTABELLE\nREAL LIFE IS NO\nCOOL\nSMALLTOWN\nSUPERSOUND\nALBUM\nMost listened to this week by\nFelix Music members on last.fm\n1.

    "content": "21\nfelix FRIDAY 22 JANUARY 2010\ntechnology.felix@imperial.ac.uk TECHNOLOGY\nGoogle\u2019s done with China\u2019s censorship\nG\noogle and China have never really been the best of\nfriends, and now finally it\u2019s\nall over. Following security\nbreaches of Google servers by hackers\nthought to originate from China, last\nweek Google announced that it would\nbe removing censorship from all of its\nChinese services. Although the future\nis still uncertain, it\u2019s extremely likely\nthat we\u2019ll see the end of Google.cn and\nthe company effectively exiled from\nthe country. As is usual, Google claims\nthe moral high ground and reinforces\nits \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d attitude, but other evidence suggests that Google may have\nanother hidden agenda.\nIn mid-December, attackers were\nable to gain access to two Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists by using a previously undocumented flaw with Internet Explorer. Actual\ncorrespondence was not obtained,\nbut the hackers were still able to get\ninformation on basic account details,\nincluding the subject lines of emails.\nDmitri Alperovitch from computer\nsecurity firm McAfee claimed that\nthis was the most sophisticated hacking attack on a commercial company\nthat he has ever been seen. The corporate servers of Adobe and at least 33\nother companies were also targeted in\nthe \u2018highly coordinated\u2019 attack, which\nGoogle says originated from China.\nThe level of sophistication entailed\nleads many to suggest that the hackers\nwere agents of, if not directly employed\nby, the Chinese government.\nGoogle\u2019s local presence in China\nbegan in 2006 when the company\nlaunched Google.cn, which is to China\nwhat Google.co.uk is for us. Although\nthe company was obviously very positive to be doing business in the country,\nthe move attracted massive criticism\nafter it was revealed that search results\nwere being actively censored according\nto rules from the Chinese government.\nThis included websites critical of the\nCommunist regime and news and\nimages from particular events, most\nfamously the Tiananmen Square pro-tests. At the time co-founder Sergey\nBrin still tried to emphasise that they\nwere doing the right thing. Part of the\nagreement was that Google could tell\nusers that their searches were being\nfiltered and by doing so, Brin claimed,\nit would let Chinese citizens know that\ntheir government was trying to hide\ninformation.\nThings continued in this way until\n2009 when the Chinese authorities\nbegan to tighten their grip on internet access in the country. Along with\nthe demand for all home PCs to run\n\u2018Green Dam\u2019, government censorship\nsoftware masquerading as a parental\ncontrol filter, the China Illegal Information Reporting Centre demanded\nthat Google block several overseas\nwebsites of which many were sexual\nin nature. Then, in December, hackers\ninfiltrated Google and tried to gain access to the Gmail accounts of Chinese\nhuman rights activists.\nFollowing the incident, and in conjunction with what they call \u2018attempts\nover the past year to further limit\nfree speech,\u2019 on 12th January Google\nsignalled the end to its censorship in\nChina, even if it meant \u2018having to shut\ndown Google.cn\u2019 and their Chinese of-fices. This does however seem a little\nsuspicious, especially considering that\nsome top security analysts have called\nthe attack \u2018routine\u2019 despite its level of\nsophistication. Mikko Hypponen of\nsecurity firm F-Secure said, \u2018this wasn\u2019t\nin my opinion ground-breaking as an\nattack. We see this fairly regularly.\u2019\nGiven also that Google has so far made\nno claim to be ending its compliance\nwith US laws which limit freedom of\nspeech, such as those which made it\nremove sites critical of scientology in\n2002, it\u2019s easy to wonder if censorship\nreally is the only item pushing Google\u2019s\nagenda. After all, if such attacks are indeed \u2018routine,\u2019 then why has this particular incident made the company do\nsuch an abrupt U-turn on its censorship policy?\nClearly, a company as big as Google\ndoes not act on impulse when pulling out of a market as large and with\nas much potential as China. The evi-Simon Worthington takes a look at the story that has the technology press going crazy over censorship\nnumber one visited website (which interestingly enough Google used to own\na share in prior to setting up their own\nservice). According to Alexa, while\nBaidu sits in the top spot Google ranks\na paltry third, for once failing to dominate the search market. Given this relatively poor performance for the search\nengine giant it wouldn\u2019t be surprising\nif quitting China has been on the cards\nfor quite a while. Google does stand\nto lose $600 million annually from the\nmove, but that is a tiny sum compared\nto their global revenue of $22 billion.\nWhat\u2019s more likely is that Google\nhave decided their \u201cdon\u2019t be evil\u201d image is worth more than the money they\nstand to lose. Indeed, although their\nstock price took a tumble after the announcement just days later it was back\nto its original position as if nothing\nhad happened. In 2006 many called\nfor a boycott on the search engine and\nsaid that the company had betrayed its\nideals. Google will be hoping that this\nmove will restore its position in the\npublic eye as a \u2018nice\u2019 company and win\nit some favourable publicity which will\nhave much more financial benefit in\nthe West. This move also puts pressure\non rivals Microsoft and Yahoo who\ncontinue to operate under censorship\nand have much more to lose from quitting the Chinese market altogether.\nAlthough Google\u2019s decision does\nsend a strong message about censorship and freedom of speech, it cannot\nbe denied that Google has a lot to gain\npersonally from it. Taken at face value,\nthis decision certainly will cost Google\nmoney up front. But in the long term\ntheir reputation of being a \u2018nice\u2019 and\n\u2018good\u2019 company may serve them better\nand help them to succeed in the markets they currently do not dominate,\nsuch as their ever-growing Android\nphone business, whose China launch\nhas recently been delayed by Google.\nGoogle\u2019s Chinese head-quarters, perhaps soon to be an empty shell should the pull out go ahead.\n6/2006\nGoogle sells its share in Baidu.\n\u201cClearly, a\ncompany as\nbig as Google\ndoesn\u2019t act on\nimpulse\u201d\ndence may suggest that at least part\nof the reason for Google\u2019s actions is\nself-interested or economic. Google.cn\nis very much an underdog in China to\nBaidu.com, the government controlled\nsearch engine that is currently China\u2019s\nSept 2004\nGoogle is found to be omitting\nnews sources blocked by the\nChinese government from its\nGoogle News China service.\nJune 2004\nBaidu, a domestic Chinese\nsearch engine company,\nreceives a \u2018sizeable\u2019 investment\nfrom a consortium of\ncompanies led by Google.\nSept 2004\nGoogle opens up its popular\nadvertising program, Adsense,\nto Chinese text ads.\nSept 2002\nChina blocks access to Google\nfor 10 days.

(Of course, you\ncould be Australian, and actually live\nin Melbourne-but that\u2019s not something\nI would wish on anyone.)\nUnderstandably, then, Andy Murray\nand his compatriots of the pro-tennis-player persuasion have decided to take\nrefuge from the weather amongst the\nkangaroos (although the one million\npound winner\u2019s prize money might\ncount for something). With the three\nBrits in the main draw managing to get\nthrough to the second round, their time\nin Oz might actually be productive.\nMurray\u2019s first grand slam, then? I\nwouldn\u2019t bet on it. Federer may not be\nin the best of form at the moment, but\nhim nor Nadal can never be written\noff. Not to mention US open champ\nDel Potro looking to show he\u2019s not a\none-hit wonder, and upstart Nikolay\n\u201cFederer-killer\u201d Davydenko looking\nfor a big win. The women\u2019s draw is\nalso more interesting than it\u2019s been in\na while, with Kim Clijsters and Justine\nHenin both recently back from retirement and shaking the (pretty parched)\nfield up somewhat.\nAs much as the public is behind\nMurray, though, if he doesn\u2019t win we\u2019ll\nprobably blame the weather anyway.\nIC Snooker at nine-ball championships\nVictor Loi Snooker\nThe pool season started off with a bang\nas ICU Snooker prepared for its first\ntournament of the year.

The tournament\nstarted with the Individual Championship. All our players were fortunate\nenough to receive a bye in the first\nqualifying round but that also meant\nthey lacked tournament practice on\nthe unfamiliar tables.This proved to be\na critical point: of the four players, only\nVictor managed to get through to the\nlast 64 with a 5\u20130 win over Cardiff\u2019s\nIwan Lewis.

Putting the disappointing results in the individual competition behind them, the team decided\nto focus all of its efforts in the team\ntournament.\nThe initial group stage got under\nway with a beautiful start for Imperial.\nWe won our first match against Edge\nHill 3 with Victor\u2019s 5\u20134 win over Liam\nMustapher Botchway Football\nI\nI\nImpe i\ni\nri l\nl\nal C\nC\nC l\nl\noll\nl\nlege M\nM\nMen\u2019\n\u2019s 1 t\nst X\nX\nXI\nI\nI 1\nRe d\nading University 1st X\nXI 5\nThe 3rd round of the BUCS brought a\nmouthwatering tie between the flagship footballing sides of Imperial and\nReading University.

Imperial\nhas owned the site since 1956. The site\nis now comprised of nine halls of resi-dence, a state-of-the-art sports centre,\na shop and a brand new restaurant/bar\nthat is highly popular with both students and staff.\nHaving arrived by bicycle, the Mayor\nlooked around the site and spoke to\nstudents living in its newest hall, Eastside. Mr Johnson was also cooked food\nfor by some of the students there, be-Imperial is increasingly the go to place for leaders from a wide variety of political backgrounds, and as several\nvisit the South Kensington campus this week, Features Editor Afonso Campos reports\nfore moving on to officially open the\nresidence and the square. Of note in his\nspeech was the description of Imperial\nas \u201camongst the very finest of universities\u201d, adding that he also wanted to \u201csee\nmore Nobel Prize winners cut their\nteeth in South Kensington\u201d. Humorous\nas always, Mr Johnson exclaimed that\npenicillin, invented in London, can be\n\u201cvery useful after a night out in Praed\nStreet\u201d.\nThe new Acting Rector, Sir Keith\nO\u2019Nions commented that as an insti-tution, \u201cWe\u2019re all honoured that the\nMayor is joining us to celebrate the\ncompletion of the work\u201d. Ashley Brown\nthe Union President, added that the\nentire area has been \u201ctransformed\nfrom a rogue\u2019s gallery of architectural\ndisasters into a magnificent square\u201d.\nThe College was also privy to a visit\nfrom Kapil Sibal, India\u2019s relatively new\nMinister of Human Resource Development. He is Minister of Science\nand Technology as well as Minister\nof Earth Sciences. The visit comes as\npart of a week-long tour of a mission to\nfurther the educational bonds between\nthe United Kingdom and India. India\nis looking at ways in which it is able to\nimprove its higher education system\nand is planning to create institutions\nthat go by the name of \u201cinnovation universities\u201d. Initially, these will focus on\nthe prominent issues of health, environment and reusable technologies in\nthe power generation arena. The main\nreason for the visit to Imperial College\nitself however, was to observe how our\nuniversity operates its processes of\ntransferring technological and scientific research into applications that can\nbe commercially viable and applicable\nto real-world scenarios.\nImperial Innovations is headed by Dr\nMartin Knight, is a technology transfer\ncompany owned partly by the university and it is based at the South Kensington Campus. It has spawned over\n80 companies in the last decade and\nwas the main focus of Mr Sibal\u2019s visit.\nSir Keith, mentioned that he was \u201cdelighted to welcome Mr Sibal to Imperial, and to discuss with him his very\nexciting and far-sighted approach to\nhigher education in India\u201d. He added\nthat as a university, Imperial has an obligation to turn \u201cresearch into tangible\nbenefits to society\u201d.\nWhile unrelated to Imperial College directly, two heavyweights did\nspend time on campus last Saturday.\nAs part of the Fabian Society\u2019s new\nyear conference, Gordon Brown and\nPeter Mandelson delivered what the\nmedia have started describing as the\nfirst \u201ckeynote\u201d speech of the new election year. Gordon Brown\u2019s speech was\ndelivered in the morning, in the Great\nHall (Sherfield Building), kicking off a\nday of other very high profile speakers,\nincluding Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation\nand Skills, Ken Livingstone and former\nleader of the Liberal Democratic party,\nVince Cable. Mr Brown stated that the\nparty was \u201cfighting to win\u201d, making full\nuse of pathos, in what is already considered a crucial speech that outlined\nhis party\u2019s strategy of increasing social mobility - a theme that is due to\nbecome the central issue of the cam-paign.

Nowhere else would you\nfind an Ivy League elitist engaging in\nhigh level debates with the farmers,\nsteel workers and college drop-outs of\nthe American heartland. The idealistic\nvirtues of politics are exemplified and\nthe devious natures of political manipulation are forgotten. \u201c...5 minutes with\nthe average voter\u201d, rather than the \u201cbest\nargument against democracy\u201d (again\nChurchill) I think it perfectly demonstrates the essence of it. With the\naddition of Hollywood glamour, the\nalluring factor of election season becomes irresistible. If anyone has seen/\niPlayered the film about the election\nstory of Barack Obama last week, they\nwill have see the struggles, hopes and\ntriumphs of a Presidential election. A\nstory any Hollywood producer would\nhave been proud of, the \u201cAmerican\ndream\u201d has never been more enticing,\nmuch like the silicone infested body of\nPamela Anderson.\nHowever, like Pamela Anderson,\nAmerican democracy is unfortunately\nall show and no substance. Take the\ncase of Barack Obama, a person so full\nof hope and promise, destined to lead\nAmerica out of the depths of despair\nand into a new age of glory. One year\nafter \u201cObamaina\u201d, it is difficult to see\nwhat he has actually done to change\nAmerica let alone deserve a Nobel\nPrize (ironically \u201cChange\u201d essentially\nwon him the election). Obama has\njust about tried everything to make\nan impact but even the air of promise\nhas been suffocated by the poisons of\nWashington. The much hyped healthcare reform so central to his campaign\nfinally passed the Senate on Christmas Eve and after going through the\nreshaping of the US Congress, it has\nbeen maimed beyond recognition, a\nfar cry from Obama\u2019s initial dream of\ngovernment funded universal health-care. Countless other Obama initia-tives, foreign and domestic including\nkey campaign issues such as Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan,\nClimate and Economy are stuck in the\nmonotonous grinding processes of the\nHouse and Senate and it is difficult to\nsee how long it would be until any results are seen.\nIt is easy to criticise the US Congress\non delaying issues for the sake of political shenanigans but I think the US\nDemocratic system is to blame. Yes\nthe very democracy that I championed\nat the start of the article is indeed the\nroot of the problem. Herein lies the\nproblem and it is a wonder that anything ever gets done in American poli-tics: 4 years in a presidency, 2nd year\nmidterms, 4th year re-election therefore need to campaign therefore nothing substantial gets done; 3rd year is\nafter midterms which means Congress\nhas changed therefore new people can\nappear on the scene to satisfy or you\nmight have lost the majority and you\nneed to think about re-election therefore minimal things get done. This\nonly leaves the first year to get anything done and if it takes 11 months to\npass a healthcare bill then how can a\npresident deliver on his promises highlighted so poetically in the campaign?\nI really do hope the idea of democracy in America in more than mere de-bate, great rhetoric in campaigns and\npolitical manipulation in government.\nMario Cuomo said that \u201cYou campaign\nin poetry. You govern in prose\u201d and I\nwish more life-changing prose can\nbe written from the Oval Office. In\nfact American democracy could not\nbe simpler: either run for elections or\ndelay actually governing until another\none comes along! Like Pamela Anderson, American democracy entices you\nwith its tantalizing appeal of elections,\nbut Hollywood surgery only serves to\nlook good and nothing more.\nAliJawadonthelackofhumanrightsinGaza\n\u201c...like Pamela\nAnderson,\nAmerican\ndemocracy is\nunfortunately\nall show and no\n2\n4th December, 2008. Many\nof us were most likely sitting at home with the family,\nenjoying a peaceful night in,\nor out partying with friends,\nas Christmas Eve should be. Yet some\n2000 miles away, the mood could not\nbe more different. On a 25-mile strip\nof coastal land steeped in history,\ncontroversy and conflict, fighting had\nonce again broken out. This foresaw\nmore tears and bloodshed in the area\nfamously dubbed \u2018the world\u2019s largest open-air prison\u2019 \u2013 a fitting name\nfor the territory, walled-off and under\nstrict constant surveillance, encapsulating a million and a half people, many\ninnocent children unknowing of what\nwould befall them. War had once more\nstruck Gaza, Palestine, already decrepit from years of repeated battles.\nYet this recent conflict, referred to as\n\u2018The Gaza War\u2019, spurned tragedies unprecedented on these grounds, with an\nestimated death toll of 1400 Palestinians, over 900 of whom were civilians,\nas reported by the Palestinian Centre\nof Human Rights. However, this contrasts drastically with figures presented\nby the opposing Israeli Defence Force,\nwith 1100 Palestinian mortalities, and\nthe ratio of civilians to militia reversed.\nThe discrepancy between statistics,\nnot to mention the barring of reporters\nfrom entering the war zone, highlights\nthe shrouded nature of this particular\nclash. Channel 4 news stalwart John\nSnow, viewing the clash from a hilltop\noutside the Gazan borders, reported:\n\u2018As with every military conflict, the\ninevitable first casualty is the truth...\ncaught in a pincer movement of lack of\naccess, and our own regulations\u2019. Even\nUN Representatives were restricted\nfrom investigating accounts of numerous war crimes and severe breaches of\nhumanitarian law, such as the shelling\nof a former UN school-turn-refugee\ncamp, resulting in the reported deaths\nof 40 Palestinians. Statistics can only\nshow a small portion of war \u2013 the true\nhorrors, such as countless bodies lying\nin blood-spattered rubble, or a hysterical mother rushing through the streets\ncarrying the remains of what used to\nbe her living, breathing child, had to\nbe seen to be understood. As John\nSnow also stated: \u2018Wrapped remains\nand wailing women shock, but do not\nconnect in the same way. We see the\nimage, we know it\u2019s bad, but we do not\nexperience the emotion. When the\nIsraelis exclude the media, they know\nwhat they are doing.\u2019\nAs we look back on history, we only\nneed to go as far as the new Millennium to gather a veritable number of\npast conflicts, setting aside the countless wars dating back to the historical\nformation of the State of Israel in 1948.\nThe years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003\nhave all hosted major clashes between\nIsraeli Forces and Palestinian Militia,\nwith the unavoidable involvement of\nthe densely-populated Gaza. Yet it was\n2004 that marked the first of a series\nof Gaza-centred urban skirmishes,\nwith reiterations in the second half of\n2006, 2007-2008 and, most recently,\nthe 17-day massacre of December\n2008 to January 2009. Major fighting\nhas become more than a regular visitor to the region; it is almost routine,\nand residents\u2019 hopes for a positive\nfuture are undoubtedly deteriorating\nday by day. Yet war does not stop at\n\u2018mere\u2019 fighting \u2013 2006 is notable for\nthe Israeli sanctions on Gaza, which\nin the following year manifested into\na merciless blockade that has yet to be\nlifted, despite calls from major powers\nand figures worldwide. The damage\nto the economy is not nearly as serious as its brutal effect on living conditions and the health services. Without running water and electricity, and\nlacking supplies, Gaza slowly began\nto wither, with hospitals producing\nhorrific numbers of mortalities. Yet\namidst the cries, Egypt, once a sympathiser with the victims, sealed off\npassage and aid with a barrier of their\nown, leaving what seemed to be almost\nno way out. Finally, the impoverished\nenclave was struck further when the\nGaza War inflicted another $2 billion\nworth of damage. And Human Rights?\nThe great papers of Declaration now\nlay tattered amongst the smouldering\nremains of war.\nYet the 2008/2009 war was also different in another sense; it resonated\nuncomfortably with a public previously apathetic to the goings-on in the ter-ritory. Support from all over the globe\nhas poured in, and people, a vast proportion of them students, have rallied\nin their furious shouts for \u2018something\nto be done\u2019, for \u2018Human Rights to be acknowledged\u2019, for \u2018the murder to cease\u2019.\nAside from major charities such as\nUNICEF and British Red Cross pledging their aid, numerous smaller charities have sprung up to play their part.\nThe recent conflict in particular saw a\nnationwide student backlash - student\nactivism took hold of the universities,\nin a manner somewhat reminiscent of\nthe days of the Vietnam War. This January will herald Gaza Awareness week\nin Imperial College London, orchestrated by Ahlul Bayt Society, providing\nan opportunity for you to get involved\nor even just to educate yourself about\nthis worthy cause.\nKenWuontheglamourofAmericandemocracy\n\u201cDamage to the\neconomy is not as\nserious as its effect\non living conditions\nand health services\u201d\n\n"

The Republicans now\nhave 41 seats in the Senate, which allows them to filibuster legislation. Crucially, it should allow them to block the\nDemocrat\u2019s proposed socialisation of\nhealthcare.\nGiven the signals that this has sent\nabout the current political sentiments\nof the American people, Brown\u2019s election should make it less likely that\nmoderate Republicans, such as Olympia Snowe, will back the Democrats on\nkey current issues such as the Democratic healthcare proposals, which are\nbeing held in the Senate.\nIt could even encourage some of the\nmoderate Democrats such as Blanche\nLincoln to vote with the Republicans\non such matters. The Senate Democratic leadership may now try to force\nthrough the Healthcare Bill before\nScott is seated. However, there is opposition to that, even from some Democrats such as Senator Jim Webb, who\nsaid in a statement that it would be\n\u201cfair and prudent\u201d to suspend further\nvotes on healthcare legislation until\nBrown is seated.\nGoldman Sachs employees earning\nhealthy bonuses after strong profits\nGoldman Sachs has received much criticism for paying large bonuses even after\nbeing bailed out of bankruptcy by the American taxpayer. But with so many\nstudents here at Imperial thinking of going into investment banking after their\ndegrees, it might be nice to reflect on how well you can do, even after your firm\nand industry fail big time. Below is a list compiled by ABC News of 10 Goldman\nemployees likely to earn bonuses of more than $10 million this year:\nTraders\n1 \u2013 Pierre-Henri Flamand is a French-born 39-year-old who was rumoured to\nhave been paid $100 million a few years ago (Goldman denied it). Flamand is\nthe London-based global head of Goldman\u2019s purely proprietary trading group,\nGoldman Sachs Principal Strategies. Goldman CEO Blankfein has said pure\nprop trading is only 10 percent of the firm\u2019s trading revenues and profits.\n2 \u2013 Ashok Varadhan, one of Goldman\u2019s top fixed-income guns, is the global\nhead of foreign exchange trading in North America. Varadhan, who was made\npartner in 2002 at age 29, owns luxury digs in the same New York apartment\nbuilding as Blankfein. Varadhan\u2019s dad, Srinivasa, teaches math at New York\nUniversity. He had a brother, Gopal, who worked as a trader for Cantor\nFitzgerald and was killed in the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.\n3 \u2013 David Heller joined Goldman in Asia in the late 1980s. He has risen within\nthe firm, becoming the head of global equity a few years ago. Last year, he was\nnamedco-headoftheSecuritiesDivision.Goldman\u2019sequitiesdivisiondelivered\n$2.8 billion in revenues in the third quarter alone. \u201cHeller is possibly the one\nperson other than Gary [Cohn, Goldman\u2019s president] who could someday\nsucceed Blankfein,\u201d said one Wall Street headhunter.\n4 \u2013 Ed Eisler is head of interest rate trading, which is part of Goldman\u2019s most\nprofitable division, Fixed Income Commodities and Currency. The FICC group\ncontributedthelion\u2019sshareofthefirm\u2019s$24billionintradingrevenuesrecorded\nthrough the first nine months of the year.\nAsset Managers\n5 \u2013 Raanan Agus, 41-year-old manager of Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,\na $7 billion hedge fund created at the start of 2008. Agus, a world-class chess\nenthusiast who is known to prefer Honda minivans to Hummers, runs the GSIP\nfund within Goldman\u2019s asset management division, which has nearly $1 trillion\nunder management. Through the first half of the year, Agus\u2019 GSIP, which had a\nrocky 2008, was said to have had gains of around 6 percent.\n6 \u2013 Marc Spilker, who helps run Goldman\u2019s entire massive investment\nmanagement business, recently made the kind of headlines his bosses hate. He\ngot into a vitriolic public dispute with his East Hampton neighbour, hedge fund\nheavyweight Jim Chanos, over a shared pathway to the beach near their homes.\nSpilker\u2019s area produces nearly $1 billion in revenues each quarter.\nSalespeople\n7 \u2013 Harvey Schwartz, Goldman\u2019s head of global sales and a co-head of the firm\u2019s\nsecurities division. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much sales drives Goldman\u2019s\nbusiness,\u201d said one Wall Street headhunter. \u201cHarvey is always among the firm\u2019s\nbest paid people.\u201d\n8 \u2013 Isabelle Ealet, London-based global head of commodities and who runs\nthe sales team for this hugely successful trading operation. She ranks No. 32 on\nFortune magazine\u2019s list of the most powerful women in business.\nBankers\n9 \u2013 Gordon Dyal, global head of mergers and acquisitions. According to\nDeallogic, Goldman ranked No.1 in global M&A transactions through the first\nthree-quarters of the year. Its investment banking division had produced $3.2\nbillion in net revenue. In one of the biggest fee-generating deals of the year,\nGoldman advised Burlington Northern Santa Fe when the railroad was bought\nout for $44 billion by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway.\n10 \u2013 Richard Friedman, 51-year-old head of Goldman\u2019s merchant banking\ndivision. A few years ago he helped pull off the historic initial public offering\nof the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Goldman has maintained a\nmodest investment stake in ICBC, which continues to produce eye-popping\nreturns \u2013 ICBC shares yielded Goldman $1.1 billion worth of revenue through\nthe first nine months of 2009.\nThe complaints about excessive bonuses at the big investment banks, especially\nGoldman, have not just been coming from politicians and the media. The\nSecurity Police and Fire Professionals of America Retirement Fund has filed\na shareholder lawsuit against the bank, naming its CEO Lloyd Blankfein and\nother leading executives as defendants. The suit is seeking to recover billions of\ndollars that Goldman has paid to its employees in bonuses over the past couple\nof years.\nAlthough the bank has repaid its TARP money, its critics claim that it has also\nunfairly benefited from its bonds being backed by the government at no cost, as\nwell as from the bailout of AIG, in which it was a major shareholder. However,\neven in recent years, the US governement has gained vastly more in tax revenue\nfrom the bank than it has spent bailing it out.\nO\nn Tuesday, the Massachusetts Senate race\nwas won by the Republican candidate, Scott\nBrown. His Democratic rival Martha Coakley put up a\npathetically weak fight. Her official\ncampaign literature misspelt the word\nMassachusetts, and she confused the\nBoston Red Sox with the New York\nYankees (Boston is the capital of Massachusetts). Brown was able to win the\nseat despite Republicans being outnumbered three to one in the state.\nHis victory sends an especially clear\nmessage about Obama\u2019s falling prestige and the Democrats\u2019 momentum\nheading into the 2010 campaign sea-son, because he had chosen to make\nsignature issues out of the key dividing lines in US politics today.\nMassachusetts Republicans had\nfeared that voters may choose the\nDemocratic candidate out of pure\nhabit. The seat has been in Kennedy\nhands for over half a century and\nDemocratic since the early \u201820s. Seeking to address this issue Brown had\nnoted that, \u201cthis Senate seat belongs\nto no one person, no one political par-ty. This is the people\u2019s seat.\u201d\nJohn Walsh, Chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party, blamed\nthe Party and the campaign that it ran,\n\u201cwe have to get better at describing\nBrown has been running as an in-dependent, going around the state in\na pick-up truck and asking famous\nRepublican politicians not to actively\ncampaign for him. This led Massachusetts\u2019 former Republican Governor\nPaul Cellucci to conclude that, \u201cthe\nmessage for the national Republican\nParty should be, even though people aren\u2019t happy with the Democrats\nright now, if we get back to power we\ncan find ways to be independent and\nbe bipartisan. People are sick of this\npartisanship.\u201d\nBrown will serve the rest of the late\nSenator Ted Kennedy\u2019s term, until\nJanuary 2013. He replaces Paul Kirk, a\nclose friend of Ted Kennedy who was\nappointed by Democratic Governor\nDeval Patrick on Sept 24 to temporarily fill the vacant seat.\nIronically, Mr. Kirk could have\nserved out the remainder of Ted\nKennedy\u2019s term but for recent Democratic legislation that requires special\nelections for vacant Senate seats in the\nCommonwealth.\nThat legislation was passed at a time\nwhen a Democratic state legislature\nfeared that then Republican Governor,\nMitt Romney would appoint a Republican to fill John Kerry\u2019s seat. A seat\nwhich was supposed to be vacated by\nKerry winning the 2004 United States\nPresidential elections.\n\n"
