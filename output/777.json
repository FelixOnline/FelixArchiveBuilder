    "content": "FELIX \u2022if\nSPORT Seniors squash tournament\nThe idea of this multi-department squash\ntournament arose after a number of\ninterdepartmental squash friendlies had\nreceived an enthusiastic response from\nall the parties involved.\nThe tournament took place in three\nrounds, each round consisting of four\nmatches between the two teams.\nThe Captains had assigned a ranking\nof one (good) to four (poor) to each\nmember of their team. Players of equal\nrank were matched in play against each\nother, each match being the best of three\ngames. The winning team would have\nto show depth in its ability to produce\nconsistently good squash play because\neach player was restricted to playing in\na maximum of two matches with a trial\nof twelve matches having to be played.\nAt the start of the first round the\nDepartment of Materials looked\nformidable with three class players\nleading their line up. Their strength at\nthe top was confirmed when Sheppard\nand Sweeney easily held their matches\nagainst Bashir and Ross respectively.\nHowever, Chem Eng looked like\ndrawing the round when Dr D Stuckey\nwon his match and Vadley was leading\none game to love in hers, but Stokes\nfought back to take the match two games\nto one to pick up a vital two victory\npoints for Materials.\nThere was less excitement in the other\nhalf of the first round where Maths\ndecisively beat Mech Eng to pick up two\nvictory points as well.\nBy the second round, the atmosphere\non the courts had become tense. The\nmatch between Ross and Downie had to\nbe declared void when Ross had his\neyebrow slashed by his opponents racket\nin the heat of play. Chem Eng eventually\nhad a comfortable win over Maths by\ntwo matches to one.\nThere was tremendous excitement in\nthe match between Prof Sheppard and\nMike Carling. Sheppard tried to unnerve\nhis opponent through his aggressive\nappealing for let calls from the referee,\nbut excellent umpiring from I Mcintosh\naverted disaster and kept play in\nprogress. The Dept of Materials were\nnot able to maintain the pressure in the\nmatches lower down in the order and\ncould only pick up a draw round against\nMech Eng.\nThis left the tournament finely poised\nin the final round with Materials leading\nwith three victory points, closely\nfollowed by Chem Eng and Maths on\ntwo. With the adrenal in in full flow,\nChem Eng easily saw off Mech Eng by\nbeating them in all four matches to notch\nup another two victory points. This was\nnot good enough to stop Materials from\nwinning the tournament by a clear\nvictory point, when Maths could only\nwin one of their four matches against\nthem.\nThe player of the tournament award\nmust go to Prof Terry Sheppard and his\ncapacity to charge around the court, his\npure a gres sion during play and that look\nof agony on his face\"when his appeals\nfor let calls were turned down, made the\ntournament a memorable occasion.\nSince, this trial tournament was a resounding success, the introduction of\nan in aug ral Imperial College Seniors\nDepartmental Squash Tournament next\nyear is a certainty. It is hoped that a trophy worthy of such a major college\nsporting event can be purchased and be\non display in the Union Office before\nthe heats start in the Autumn term to\ndecide the qualifiers for the finals. I hope\nthat those who become involved will be\nproud to fight for their departments to\nget a place in the July 1988 finals.\nThe postgraduates and senior\nmembers of this College need an event\nlike this squash tournament to make life\nmore interesting at Imperial. I hope that\na large number of departments will be\nsubmitting teams as soon as details of\nthe tournament and heats have been\npublicised.

This particular\nbrand washes whiter and digs deeper,\nso if you thought last year's anonymous\nletters were shocking, then 'you ain't seen nothing yet'. We've kept the old\nreliable formula but added some sparkle.\nThis 'Postgraduate Issue' is only a hint\nof things to come. The next issue will\nappear on Monday 5th October.\nHow can you help?\nFrom speaking to various people\naround College, it is clear that our idea\nof a good FELIX doesn't always tie in\nwith most students' idea of what the\nnewspaper should contain. It's very easy\nto stick to the usual formula if nobody\ncomplains about it. If you want to see\nsomething in FELIX that isn't here, then\nplease write and tell us about it. It's very\neasy to get isolated in our little basement\nand we're not mind readers.\nScience\nOne addition has been a new science\npage. We are looking for a postgraduate\nor member of staff to act as Science\nEditor. The job involves writing and\ncollating various scientific news items\neach week. If you are at all interested\nthen either telephone me today on int\n3515 or visit our offices anytime during\nSeptember.\nCensorship\nIn the light of the Handbook episode\n(page 5) it is time for Publications Board\nto reexamine the editor's role on our\nexternal pub h cations. Was Pippa Salmon\nelected to collate information and\nproduce the guide, with the Union\nExecutive deciding on the tone of\narticles, or was she elected to edit a fair\nand representative handbook? Perhaps\nthe Executive wish to change her title\nto Handbook Manager? The publication\nwould lose its credibility if it allowed\nitself to become a pure advertisement for\nthe Union. There is no point in extolling\nthe virtues of the Union Bar and o imt ting all the faults. Freshers will soon realise\nthat the articles are biased toward the\nUnion facilities and consequently will\narrive at College with the opinion that\nthe Union is only interested in putting\nforward its corporate view point. This\nmakes the Union just as bad as College\nwith the rosy picture it paints in its\nprospectus.\nI hope that Publications Board makes\nsome policy for once and defends the\neditorial freedom which we value so\nhighly in FELIX.\nFinance Fiasco\nThe rumours are rife within Sherfield\nas to who will lose their job after the\nlatest financial cock up. Perhaps College\nwill finally see sense and completely\nshake up the Finance Section before we\nfollow the same path as University\nCollege, Cardiff.\nAnd finally\nThe Office will be closed from\ntomorrow for three weeks.\nEditor-in-chief\nNews Editor\nReviews Editor\nTypesetting\nPrinting\nContribution/Production\nJudith Hackney\nPippa Salmon\nAshley Niblock\nRose Atkins\nDavid Jones\nAlan Barnett, Al Birch, Dave Colley\nNoel Curry, Bill Goodwin, Ian Howgate, Chas Jackson\nChris Jones, David Jones, Chris Martin, Yishu Nanda\nRobert Shiels and Chris Stapleton\nG9 V1'\\J HUS' fu t frI F/Ao a../ \u2014\n/ ' . / \\ ir.&.\u00ab7.\nFriday August 14th1987 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "IN THE world of journalism,\nnews was once defined as a piece of information that\nsomeone, somewhere\ndoesn't want you to print.\nAnything else, so the theory\ngoes, is merely free\nadvertising.\nThis is no less true within\nthe world of student\njournalism.\nWithin College, we\nobserve the administration\nbending over backwards\nwith press releases on\nAlumnus Days, refectory\nprofits, art exhibitions, and\nother misc e lane a. Whilst the\nUnion anxiously publicise s' its achievements at UGMs,\nCouncil meetings, and one\nhundred and one other\ncommittees.\nYet the real news is rarely\nmentioned. It becomes\nentangled within the internal\npolitics of Sherfield and the\nUnion Office. The shutters\nare drawn as soon as one\nhints of mistakes or\nshortfalls within the system,\nand reporters become the\nvictims of irrational abuse.\nIn the Fifth Column we will\nbe bringing to light some of\nthe things which the College\nand the Union have preferred\nto keep under wraps. We will\nbe investigating major issues\noutside of College, and\nexposing one or two\nscandals. We will take a more in depth look at news\nas it reveals itself at Imperial,\nand indulge in the occasional\ngeneral interest feature. In\nshort, a mixed bag, but one\nthing is certain-definitely no\nadvertising.\n:''.G*'n Letters Send your letters to Judith Hackney, FELLX Office, ICU, Beit\nQuadrangle, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB. Slap in the face\nDear Editor,\nSeveral of my residents found your article \"Only on\nSunday\" in the last edit on of FELIX a bit of a slap in the\nface, and so I feel it my duty to write to you and set the record\nstraight.\nYour article mentions, for example, \"beefburger s barbequed\npersonally by Rob Northey\". Rob did an amazing job (for\none person), but what about the 50 odd residents from\nMontpelier Hall who helped. Between them, they ran 4 stalls,\nsupplied a guide for the tours up the Queens's Tower, ran\nmany (if not most) of the events, they made and served all\nthe punch (some of the people chopping the fruit for the punch\nnever left the kitchens during the fair), served the ice-cream\nand they made and served all the hamburgers, with a little\nhelp from Rob Northey. That is not to say that Rob did not\nwork hard; on the contrary, he worked very hard, but he was\nonly one member of a large team, all of whom worked hard !\nFurthermore, some 19 of my residents started work at noon\non the day, carrying equipment, setting up stalls and blowing\nup balloons, and most of our workers only finished at about\n7.30pm. In fact, I think it would be safe to say that if\nMontpelier had not helped on the day, of if they had not\nworked as hard or as willingly as they did, the fair would not\nhave been the success that it was. Did any other section of\nthe College make an equivalent contribution? I hope the\nCollege appreciates what we've done.\nMy hall is a happy place to live; the residents are friendly,\nco-operative and eager to participate in activities, even when\nit involves a lot of effort and sacrifice on their part. The vast\nmajority of my residents are from abroad and many will be\nreturning home in the next 2 to 3 months, possibly never to\nreturn to Imperial College. They stood to gain nothing by\nhelping at the fair. They did it because they are really nice\npeople\u2014the best around! Please give them the credit and\nrecognition that they deserve.\nYours sincerely,\nKevin 0'Conner,\nWarden, Montpelier Hall\nYour point has been taken. We apologise for the omission.\nFrauds & heroes\nDear Judith,\nI have just taken the ICU Handbook to be printed. This is\nthe end of six weeks full-time editing and to be honest it is\nrather a relief\u2014and (I hope) a chance to get some sleep.\nPeople have said I 've put a lot of work into the Handbook\nand I really appreciate their congratulations and thanks.\nHowever, I feel rather a fraud\u2014after all, it was my job! It's been really interesting (although heavy going at times) and\nin retrospect at least, I 've really enjoyed it.\nI'm writing to point out that the real heroes are people who\naren't getting praise and congratulations at all. They generously\ngave their time to paste up, write, proof read, find things I'd lost and generally be very helpful. It's no exaggeration to say\nthat the Handbook would not have appeared before the end\nof the holidays, nor would it have been to the same standard,\nwithout their help.\nI very much wish these people to know how much I value\ntheir help and how grateful I am. If I 've seemed ungrateful\nI apologise\u2014it's probably because I 've been working on auto\npilot to conserve energy. I also apologise if this letter is over\ngushing...it's written with sincerity, I assure you!\nPippa Salmon\nCongratulations on a superb Handbook\u2014gush, gush\u2014but\nit's not quite as good as last year's wonderful effort...\nSycophantic nonsense\nDear Judith,\nI'd like to take this opportunity to be as sycophantic as\npossible and to pla gia rise a very witty letter written about a year ago by a certain Mr Mark Cottle. In order to do this I will probably waffle on in this vein for several lines in a desperate attempt to fill up some space. On the other hand\nI probably won't be bothered to do anything that requires much\neffort.\nChris Jones\nThis Chris Jones person seems to have acquired the knack\nof space-filling very well and I can see such talents being\nwell utilised in this year's FELICES.\nCalculated strategy\nDear Judith,\nI think it's an absolute disgrace the shocking way Rentokil\nhas been neglected in recent years. Fearlessly confronting\ncockroaches at every turn, their most recent act of heroism\nis as yet unrecognised.\nThe matter first came to my attention three weeks ago, when\ntwo Rentokil employees strode boldly into the FELLX Office,\nclutching plastic tubes which contained raw liver. They were\ntaped to the wall at strategic point carefully calculated to cause\nshock amongst the FELIX staff. Liver was discovered in the\ntoilet, darkroom, typesetting room, by the kettle, behind the\nghetto blaster and even in Old Beit shower. However,\ninspection a week later revealed only a rather fat maggot.\nWhat was the purpose of this daring act? All can now be\nrevealed: Rentokil's 'boys in red' were saving Beit from a horrifying plague of killer ants, which were threatening the\nvery foundations of IC life as we know it. But what has been\ntheir reward? Have they been lavished with praises and\npresented to the Rector? Have they been given gold watches,\ncarriage clocks or medals? Did anyone even bother to make\nthem a cup of coffee? No! They have, as ever, been ignored,\nleft to sink into the mists of obscurity.\nThis whole affair raises some worrying questions about\nfreedom of speech, national security etc etc. The blatant lack\nof appreciation of these heroes of our time has all the hallmarks\nof a cover up. A deliberate plot to wipe out the last pockets\nof resistance to...to what? I think we should be told.\nYours sincerely,\nP Salmon, a concerned student.\nThis girl's got distinct Howgate tend an cie s. She must be\nthinking of standing for a sabbatical post this year....\nFELIX Friday August 14th198711 "

    "content": "Graduate\nPlay School\nWhy should 90 PhD research students gather for a5 day conference, when\ntheir subjects ranged from Zoology to Mathematics? Why should the Science\nand Engineering Research Council (SERC), normally tight with money, be\nwilling to pay out \u00a3300 for each student to attend?\nThe location was Sheffield, and the\nevent one of the SERC \"Graduate\nSchools\". The aim, we were informed,\nwas to show PhD students mat there are\nmany avenues worth exploring besides\na strictly academic career, and to\n' 'demonstrate the interest to be found in\njobs in industry, commerce and\nGovernment\". In short the SERC are\nworried about the number of research\nstudents staying in academia, and not\ngoing on to make a cons tri but ion to\nBritish industry, especially with the\ncurrent Government policies in higher\neducation. We were, apparently, to be\n\"educated, not pur sua ded\". As well as the 90 students, there were\n10 'executives'\u2014recently graduated\nPhD students from various courses now\nworking in industry; companies like\nIBM, BP, and from the Civil Service.\nThey were present not as Tutors, but to\ntake part in the discussions and exercises\nwith the students, to pass on their\nexperience of the real world.\nThe tutors, who actually ran the\ncourse, were a high-powered lot also\nfrom industry and Government; with\nhigh ranking positions in their respective\nareas.\nThe course was, to use the jargon,\n'intensive'. Starting at 9.00am and\nfinishing around 9.00pm, with breaks,\nonly for meals, the course was split into\n'sessions' lasting a morning or\nafternoon, on one particular area of\nindustry. The first one for example, was\na case study into the marketing of the\n\"Paul Masson California Carafes\" in\nthe early eighties.\nIn common with most of the sessions,\nit started with a general introduction to\nmarketing, and a short film on the\nparticular area we were to study. Then\nit was off into groups of about eight or\nnine, to 'role play' some particular\naspect or other. The emphasis was very\nmuch on finding out by doing; the\ninformation we were given was neither\ncomprehensive nor easily\nunderstandable, and the importance of\nlearning to work in a group was\ncontinually stressed.\nWe were given pointers as to how to\norganise our groups, pitfalls to avoid,\npointers to take. The result was, as might\nbe expected, total anarchy which (in our\ngroup anyway!) didn't seem to get any\nbetter as the course went on. Tutors kept\npopping in and telling us to concentrate\non the \"Process\" (the way the decision\nwas being made) as well as the decision\nwhatever with other groups. In the\n'Industrial Relations' exercise, one\ngroup took the management, one the\nunions etc. Tempers did run high from\ntime to time, but those groups with a more laid back approach tended to have\nthe most success.\nThroughout the five day course a 'Business Game' was organised, which\ntended to be a common thread holding\nthe course together. Groups were\norganised as companies selling hot water\nboilers. Highlight was a 'trade fair' at\nwhich the companies outdid each other\nin the attempt to find best looking\nitself, and was usually met by various\nd egress of 'get lost' looks. Maybe the\ntheory isn't as easy to apply as they\nmake out.\nPart of the problem was that we all\nwere knacker ed! \u2014having to work all\nday, and then staying up most of the\nnight in the Bar or drinking coffee meant\nthat it was sometimes difficult to find the\nmotivation and concentration that some\nof the problems required. This isn't to\nsay that we didn't take it seriously; I think everybody did, it was just we were\nhalf asleep by the end.\nThe 'role playing' would sometimes\nbe within the group, with different\nmembers taking on different roles;\nsometimes it was the group that would\ntake a common role and 'negotiate' or\nboilers. Attempts included paper-covered tables, cardboard boxes, traffic\nbol lards(!) and a Cigarette Box (!!). The\nresult was chaos with 'buyers' (the\ntutors) being dragged from stand to stand\nand being liberally plied with drinks-it was held in the Bar. The more laid\nback groups sat in the bar and waited\nfor the customers to come to them\u2014not\nas effective at selling boilers, but better\non the pocket. All great fun if you enjoy\nmaking a prat of yourself!\nThere was a feeling that the business\ngame did tend to get rather boring\ntowards the end. Twelve decisions had\nto be made in all, with half an hour for\neach decision spread throughout the\ncourse. Although some groups did get\ninvolved in \"dirty tricks\" later in the\ngame to put their competitors out of\nbusiness, otherwise there were few real\ndecisions to make.\nOne criticism that ran through the\ncourse referred to the amount of\nfeedback that we received from the\ntutors. They were all people highly\nregarded in their professions, and had\na great deal of experience in their\nrespective fields. However, what they\ndid was give the introduction to each\nsession and spend time with individual\ngroups during the session, and then let\neach group tell the others what happened\nin the concluding meeting at the end.\nThere was a strong feeling that they\ncould have put more input into the\nmeeting at the end, perhaps giving some\nof the 'right' answers\u2014what would\nhappen in practice. At the end of some\nsessions you were left with a number of\npossible solutions with little idea which\nwould be practical or possible.\nThe 'executives' were very useful,\ngiving practical advice about how to\napply to specific companies, tips etc,\nalthough the amount they got themselves\ninvolved in the activities of their group\nclearly differed from person to person.\nWas it worth it? It was hard work, and\nI think I enjoyed it (although I am not\nsure I would want to go again). Did it\nopen my eyes to a job in industry? Not\nreally\u2014I didn't learn much I didn't know\nalready. Mind you I had already been\nthrough the milk round once. It def intel y was good experience if you have never\nhad the chance to work in groups much\nbefore. Should you go if you get offered\nthe chance? Why not\u2014you get 5 days\nfree board with no academic work and\nthe chance to meet a whole lot of\ninteresting people\u2014what have you got\nto loose.\nFELIX Friday August 14th19879 "

    "content": "SUPERMAN IV\nThe Quest for Peace\n(PG) Cannon (Bayswater, Edgware Rd,\nFulham Rd, Haymarket, Oxford St,\nShaftesbury Ave) Warner (West End)\nI must admit that I went to the cinema\nwith my mind made up that this film\nwould be a load of utter trash, and would\nsuit people with the intelligence and\nsensitivity of an ant. The opening scene\npictures a cosmonaut walking in space\nsinging 'My Way' in Russian; kind of\nsetting the scene for the rest of the film\nwhich is littered with humourous\ndialogue. The plot revolves around the\nfight between our hero Superman and\nhis arch-rival 'boomerang' Lex Luther\n(Gene Hackman) who has more escapes\nfrom prison than Don Juan had partners.\nLex's sole reason for existence it seems\nis to finish off Superman (see Superman\ni,n, m). Superman conveniently provides him\nwith the opportunity, after a little boy\nwrote to him asking him to get rid of all\nnuclear weapons on earth. Superman\nstrides in to the UN and says, \"I'm gonna snaffle all your rockets\" and, to\nrapturous applause, throws them all into\nthe sun.\nLex capital is es on this by borrowing\none of Superman's body cells (from a hair) and throws something that can only\nbe described as a prawn cracker (genetic\nprotoplasm) and two bits of cloth into\nthe sun. This (apparently) creates\nNuclear Man, an evil clone of our\nsuper-hero who wears black and gold,\npresumably so we can tell them apart\neasily.\nMeanwhile, back on Earth The Globe\nnewspaper is in the midst of a takeover\nbattle. The prospective new owner is a Murdoch style Tits and Bums man, with\na rather shapely daughter Lucy\n(Mariel Hemingway).\nThe other sub-plot is the love battle\ninvolving Lois Lane (Margot Kidder),\nLucy, Clark Kent and Superman.\nTogether they arrange a farcical dinner\nfor four, with amusing results. As an\naside here, the apartment in which the\ndinner is held is the same one that is used\nin Death Wish for the party scene.\nGene Hackman plays the evil Lex\nfaultlessly and comes across as the only\nreal actor in the whole film, his\neccentricity and wit combining well to\nform a quite admirable lunatic.\nAs is the case nowadays with films\naimed primarily at a young audience,\nthere must be a plot for kids and\nsomething within that plot that appeals\nto the 'older folk'. This film, while\nfunny in places, doesn't cater well for\nthe latter. Although patriotic,\nmeaningful speeches may appeal to The\nAmerican Male, I just felt like being ill.\nIn the end, Hackman fails to save The\nQuest for Peace from predictability.\nD.C. TIN MEN\n(15) Cannon (Tott.Ct.Rd) Odeon (High\nSt Ken, Swiss Cottage)\nSET in the early 60's this film is a real\ntreat for those interested in the style of\nthe era. This, combined with some\nmemorable humour, good performances\nand brilliant soundtrack would make this\nfilm a hit even without a plot. In fact the\nstoryline of the film is extremely well\npresented and really keeps you involved\nwith it's twists and turns.\nFrom the first scene the stage is set\nnot only because of the amazing cars\ninvolved in the accident which brings the\ntwo 'tin men' together; but also through\nthe anger that is portrayed by both men\nwhen the two highly-prized automobiles\nsmash together and the action begins.\nThe two men, Tilley (played by\nDanny DeVito) and BB( Richard\nDreyfiiss) discover that they are both in\nthe aluminium building materials\nbusiness. They work for different\ncompanies in the same town selling\naluminium sidings to unsuspecting\nhouse owners. This is a film of scams,\nfast talking and a lot of ups and downs\nin the lives of the salesmen involved (one\npoor man has a heart attack whilst giving\nhis sales pitch to a couple).\nSparks start to fly when BB, in\nretaliation for the original accident,\nsleeps with Tilley's wife Nora (played\nby Barbara Hershey), and love enters\nthe hard - selling world of the Tin Man.\nR.A. EVIL DEAD\n(78) Cannon (Panton St, Royal)\nAS for splatter movies, Evil Dead II\nis definitive. The blood not only splat-ter s, but threatens to drown the cast of\nthis new film from the same writer and\ndirector as the original. Not having seen\nEvil Dead I cannot make comparisons,\nbut I can say that for this sequel prior\nknowledge is not a pre-requisite for\nenjoyment.\nI went expecting to be so scared I'd have to hold someone's hand on the way\nhome, but spent most of my time\nlaughing. This is not to say that there\nwere no shocks, there were, but it was\nall done so incredibly tongue in'cheek,\nwith elements of Clint Eastwood and The\nA Team creeping in at times, that even\nwhen the hero resorts to self-mutilation, the only reaction from the\naudience was the aforementioned\nlaughter.\nThe story is a formula used before but\nthis doesn't matter. The hero accidentally calls up an evil spirit which causes\nthe dead to rise up and try to make him\njoin them. Excellent camera work and\nunceasing action keep your attention\nright through to the end where the hero\ngets a chance at reading the obligatory\npassages from 'The Book of the Dead'.\nAll in all not for the squeamish, but\nhorror fans with a sense of humour\nshould make a beeline for the nearest\nshow.

This means that the\nCollege is set to lose several thousands\nof pounds, which doesn't make paying\noff the debts for the new student house\nany easier.\n\u2022 FOR SOME reason the Union\nExecutive has decided to be as officious\nas possible this year. Diminutive\nHandbook Editor Pippa Salmon was the\nfirst to experience the Union at its worst.\nThey decided that she didn't know\nenough about being a woman, at Imperial\nand asked for the \"women' article to be\ntoned down a little. They suggested the\nchange of 'terrible image' to' 'sexist\nimage' and a swap of the second and\nthird paragraphs. This obviously made\nall the difference!' Not content with\ntelling her what women want to read,\nthey also demanded that the 'Lesbian &\nGay' article be totally rewritten, despite\nthe fact that it was penned by last year's Lesbian & Gay Welfare Officer. They\nalso demanded that both the Snack Bar\nand Union Bar articles be made more\nappealing and that all negative points be\nedited out. Cue one rather irate,\ndiminutive Handbook Editor.\n\u2022 FAUX PAS ofthe month goes to Prof\nAsh, our illustrious Rector, who told one\naudience that College were actively\nencouraging more overseas students to\ncome to Imperial because of the money\nthat could be raised, only mentioning the\nstudents as an after thought!\n\u2022 ADRIAN \"JELLY\" JOHNSON,\nan Evelyn Gardens manager especially\nselected by Lesley Gillingham for his\nhighly developed ability to bullshit his\nway out of difficult situations, was\ncaught in a compromising situation after\ndeciding to visit the WC late one night.\nWhen he returned to his room Jelly\ndiscovered that the door had swung shut\non die latch, leaving poor Jelly standing\nnaked in the corridor. In desperation\nJelly decided to look for a bin-liner to\ncover his embarrassment. A search of\nthe house revealed only one liner full of\nrubbish, which Mr Johnson was forced\nto empty before making appropriate\nholes for his arms and legs.\nThe\ngood\nthe\nbad\nand the\nundeniably ugly\nMR WIMPY the Cook, Michael\nArsehole the janitor and Johnny\nSmooth the Bursar were having a meeting with Eric Burntout, the\nHeadmaster of Empirical School\nfor the Terminally Insane. It was\none of those occasions when they\nhad to decide who was going to\nhave to carry the can. Earlier that\nweek Burntout had received a telephone call from Empirical's Tax Collector. Burntout had been\nhorrified to discover that he owed\nthe Tax Collector two hundred\nthousand pounds because Mr Wimpy had been paying all his helpers\nwith money from the cash box. This had been happening for years\nand years, so Mr Wimpy was doing his best to convince everyone\nthat it wasn't his fault, since he had only been at Empirical School\nfor two years. As usual, everybody's first thought was to blame\nMichael Arsehole. Unfortunately, as he was never allowed to handle\nany money, the others had to agree that they couldn't pin this one\non him. Burntout and Johnny Smooth were, of course, far too\nimportant to be blamed for anything. This did not stop Smooth\nticking off Burntout in his usual manner. \"If only you hadn't made\nall those silly remarks about Empirical being broke, we would have\nbeen able-to cover this'up\", said Smooth.\nBurntout muttered som thing under his breath about Smooth being\nthe first up against the bike shed wall come the revolution.\nAfter another half an hour of arguing, during which the only useful\ndecision made was to send Michael Arsehole out for some more\njelly babies, Mr Wimpy managed to save himself from tax exile by\nsuggesting that they should blame all the workers in the money\ncounting office. This really was quite a sensible thing to do: no ie\nof the money counters knew anything about counting money. In\nfact they spent all their time sending messages to each other on\ntheir computer system and thinking up anagrams of 'VAT'.\nAfter this was agreed, Burntout announced that he wanted to\nstart a newspaper for all the teachers at Empirical School so that\nhe could get his own back on all the sixth former s who kept writing\nnasty things about him in PHALIX. He had always wanted to have\nhis own newspaper but now he had to persuade someone to do\nall the work for it. \"I think Arsehole is the man for this job\" said\nSmooth gleefully, delighted to have another opportunity to give\nArsehole a hard time. \"But I'm far too busy holding wine and cheese\nparties for the boa ties\", said Arsehole. As far as Arsehole and\nSmooth were concerned, this was just another one of Burntout's bad ideas.\nArsehole made an excuse for leaving and went back to his own\npokey little office. He rang Lesley Tantrum, the matron of all the\nEmpirical dormitories to see if she was having a worse time than\nhe was. Between them, Arsehole and Tantrum had made all the\nsixth former s very angry at the end of the last term. They had\ndemanded that all the sixth-former s be out of their rooms fifteen\nminutes after the end of their last class. They had not even allowed\nany of the sixth-former s who had nowhere else to live to stay a little longer. The result had been complete chaos: all the sixth-former s had moved out of the dormitories and into the corridor.\nWhen Arsehole ordered them out of the corridor they all gathered\ntheir belongings and went round to stay at Arsehole's house.\nArsehole had had to live with two hundred sixth-former s for several\nweeks, and he had been trying to take out his frustration on Tantrum\never since. When he dialled Tantrum's number, however, the phone\nwas answered by Alan Uglybastard, the Deputy Head Boy.\n\"Something's come up\", said Uglybastard. \"Oh well, I 'll phone back\nin ten minutes then\", said Arsehole...\nWill ten minutes be long enough?\nWho will lose their job first?\nFind out in the next episode\n\u2022 EVELYN GARDENS' resident\npain-in-the-neck, a guy known as\nFlanagan, was involved in a small drugs\nfracas. Feeling the need for some stash,\nFlanagan made his way to Earls Court\nwhere he made a purchase of \u00a310. He\nwas somewhat disgruntled to discover\nthat his stash consistently extinguished\nevery cigarette he tried it in. Only later\nwas it pointed out that he had infact been\nsold a licorice-all sort... \u2022 MR FLANAGAN again ran into\ntrouble when he decided to squirt ex-FELDC mega-artist, Chris Edwards with\na water pistol. Chris, not sharing\nFlanagan's sense of humour, turned\naround and presented him with a black\neye. Chris was later presented with a bottle of whiskey courtesy of the Evelyn\nGardens management, for his services\nto mankind.\n\u2022 TALKING of Evelyn Gardens, an\nalarming story has reached my ears.\nTwo of the cleaners found a bottle of\nvodka which had been left behind by a former resident of the room they had\nbeen told to clean. Naturally delighted\nwith their find, they proceeded to tell\neveryone they met, including the\ngorgeous, pouting Student Accommodation Officer, Lesley Gillingham.\nAfter returning from a hard morning's cleaning, the pair discovered the bottle\ngone! It was revealed later that Ms\nGillingham had ordered random\nincompetent Jelly Johnson to requisition\nit for her because she \"needed it more\nthan they did\".\n\u2022 THE QUESTION on everybody's lips this Summer seems to be 'why has\nUnion President Ian Howgate got such\npoor dress sense?' The poor man has\nbecome so embarrassed by these\nremarks that he has taken to walking\naround with a bucket on his head in\norder to preserve his dignity.\n.

He hopes that this will\nbridge the gap between administration\nand academics, while keeping old\nstudents up to date on College news.\nSquatters evicted\nRESIDENTS in Hamlet Gardens\nSummer Letting Scheme have been\nevicted having caused \u00a31,000 worth of\ndamage.\nNeighbours had complained about\nbottles being thrown out of windows and\nexcessive noise. The residents were also\nfalling behind with their rent and they\nwere even tully asked to leave. They\ndecided to become squatters, but left of\ntheir own accord when their possessions\nwere removed by the managers.\nInspection of the flat revealed that the\ncooker had been taken. Manager Symon\nCorns later apprehended two intruders,\npreventing them from entering the flat.\nLate audit\nIT WAS revealed earlier this week that\nthe annual College audit will not be\nready before the end of September. This\nmay mean that the University Grants\nCommittee will postpone awarding\nImperial's grant for the coming year.\nRoyal School of Mines President Geoff Parsons, pictured here outside the\nNatural History Museum, has been selected to jump for Britain at the World\nAthletics Championships in Rome this month.\nSecurity tightened\nSECURITY in Southside is to be\nheightened following a decision taken by\nthe Student Residence Committee last\nterm. The new scheme will be similar\nto the arrangements in Linstead Hall.\nA security guard will work from\nbehind a new counter at the East\nentrance checking the identities of\neveryone who enters. The smaller West\nentrance will be made exit-only, and the\ncentral staircase will be closed\naltogether.\nSouthside Assistant Subwarden, Al Birch, commented that there would be\nresistance to closing off all but the\nfurthest entrance for residents entering\nthe Halls but the general improvement\nin security would probably be worth it.\nAll four sabbaticals have attained good academic standing this year.

Until\nchanges in the regulations last\nSeptember, he would have been eligible\nfor the maximum benefit on his rent.\nIf Mr Woolrich is successful, students\nwho do not receive Local Education\nAuthority grants could be eligible for\narrears payments of up to \u00a3800. Some\nstudents whose parents do not pay the\ncontribution expected by the LEA could\nalso benefit.\nModerate success\nfor Alumnus Day\nTHE FIRST Imperial College Alumnus\nDay, which took place on 7th July, was\ndeclared a moderate success by the Old\nStudents Association. The Rector\nexpressed his intention to make the Day\nan annual event and it is hoped that\nword-of-mouth reports will attract many\nmore former IC students in coming\nyears.\nBRIEF New anti-apartheid\ninitiative\nSTUDENTS are going to be dissuaded from\naccepting scholarships from IBM, Shell\nand Plessey, due to their South African\nlinks, in the latest NUS anti-apartheid\ncampaign. They are also putting\npressure on students not to work in\nSouth Africa and are asking unions to\nstop buying Shell petrol for their\nminibuses.

    "content": "Union Here goes my first information\nbroadcast. All in all College is rather\nquiet at the moment and my office is at\nlast starting to look less like a home for\nlost pieces of paper. The first major pile\nof stuff that went was the mountain of\nAIDS leaflets that had engulfed a filing\ncabinet. All of you should have had one\nof these by now; if you haven't checked\nyour pigeon holes; if you have, read it.\nThe other pile that has disappeared, was\none that Carl left in the bottom of a filing\ncabinet and that's gone off for paper\nrecycling.\nTwo rather interesting developments\nhave occurred to do with residences, one\ncloser to home than the other. The\nUniversity of London Management\nAudit Office has produced a draft report\non intercollegiate halls that highlights the\ninefficient and short-sighted way in\nwhich these halls have and are being run.\nAll I can say is that any hall that can\nafford to shut for half of the Summer,\nbuy its curtains from Harrods and lay\na whole floor aside for staff that live in,\nnot including the warden and the\nbursars, who may have up to 12 room\nflats of their own can not be being cost\neffective. I 've got together with the\nhousing officers from St Mary's Hospital Medical School and Queen\nMary College as well as the University\nof London Union President and we are\nnow trying to get the other colleges to\nsupport the report because, as you would\nexpect the halls have rejected it as\nrubbish and no one is in the position to\ntell them what to do.\nCloser to home there has been quite\na lot of action on the Student Residence\nCommittee since Union Council stopped\nrecognising it as a credible decision-Many thanks for this must go to Dr\nRichard Clark (warden of Linstead and\noutgoing chairman of SRC). Dr Clark\nis to be replaced by Dr Bryan Levitt a man I know little about, but that College\nappears to have much confidence in. All I can say is if Dr Levitt manages to be\nHOWGATE'S HALF\nHOUR\nmaking body. At present the terms of\nreference are being investigated with the\naim of making them more relevant and\nrealistic, at the same time a completely\nnew committee structure is being talked\nabout and the location of the committee\nwithin the College management structure\nis being reviewed.\nanywhere near as understanding and fair\na chairman as Dr Clark he will be doing\nvery well. I have to say that I am rather\nsorry to see Dr Clark retire from this\npost as he was without a doubt the\nbackbone of the residences for many\nyears; thank you Richard!\nA point which needs some discussion\nwould appear to be the matter of whether\nCollege is legally allowed to with old anyone's degree results for not paying\ntheir bills now that the amendment of the\nData Protection Act has gone through.\nOver and above this it is questionable\nwhether it is a reasonable thing to do,\nas many people in this position have a job guaranteed on a degree result. These\npeople would be in a far better position\nto pay off their debt if they had their\nresult. Hence it would now seem a good\nidea for College to look for a new way\nof securing debt repayments.\nA few weeks ago Alan, Chas and I went to the UL U training school. This\nsparked off some interesting\nconversation about the National Union\nof Students. This ranged from people\nwho were somewhat annoyed at us not\nbeing in NUS to people who wanted to\nknow how to get out of it and what the\nadvantages were. At this time I do not\nwant to express my opinions, but would\nrather hear what you thought about the\nidea of re a ff il ation. This is an important\npoint as being outside of the NUS and\nnot discussing the pros and cons of our\nsituation gives us very little credibility.\nAs a final point we will be looking for\na Union Housing Officer at the\nbeginning of term so anyone interested\nmight like to come and talk to me about\nit.\nIan Howgate\nHon Sex Poetry Corner\nThe time has come, the Walrus said, to talk of many things\nOf shoes and ships and sealing wax, of cabbages and kings...\nEach year a large number of final year\nundergraduates consider undertaking\npostgraduate study of one form or\nanother. But what is 'postgraduate\nstudy'? What does a postgraduate do?\nThe answers to the seemingly simple\nquestions are often not known to people\nwho do not have postgraduate\nexperience.\nIn order to assist those who may be\ncontemplating taking some form of\npostgraduate study, Imperial College\nUnion produces a Postgraduate\nHandbook. This is intended as an\ninformation guide, giving details of all\nforms of postgraduate life. The next\nedition will be produced around\nChristmas time, and will be available to\nanybody who may find it useful.\nAt present the Handbook is in the\npreparatory stage, and there is still much\nto be written. I would therefore like to\nmake a general appeal for articles and\ninformation etc\u2014anything that is useful\nto know before becoming a post grad. For example; How do post grads spend\ntheir time (lectures, lab, etc), what are\nthe questions to ask at job interviews,\nwhat are the job prospects like after one\nfinishes a postgraduate course??? All information/articles would be greatly\nappreciated, and should be sent to me\nvia the FELIX Office.\nAlan Bamett,\nPostgraduate Handbook Editor\n1987-88\nI'm afraid, that's the only verse I know\n(apart from the version in original\nGreek), so I 'll have to fill the space with\nboring serious stuff.\nInsurance\nJoy of joys, the Hall of Residence\nInsurance will be administered by\nStudent Accommodation Office from\nlate September onwards. However I 'll\nbe dealing with enquiries until then.\nAs I am continuing to deal with this\ninsurance at very short notice, I am\nhaving to learn about it as I go along.\nMost people manage to be very polite\nwhen making enquiries which is much\nappreciated. Those that do not achieve\nthis (and you know who you are) only\ncreate problems for themselves.\nParking Permits\nThe current permits are valid until\nOctober 4th( unless they are special\ntemporary permits). Application forms\nfor next session will not be handed out\nuntil the first week of term, so there's no point in asking for one now.\nDuplicating\nIf anyone wants duplicating (by\nGestetner) before the start of term my\nmachine is currently underused, due to\na lack of committee minutes. Prices can\nbe provided on request.\nTransport\nCurrently, many of the vans are lying\nidle, so if you ever wanted that\npostgraduate trip to the seaside, now is\nthe time. All you need is a registered van\ndriver. Van tests can be arranged as long\nas you have held a clean, full licence for\n18 months, and are over 21 years old.\nThat's all for now folks!\nChas Jackson\nThe Union Print Unit will re-open on\n14th September\n4 Friday August 14th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Both the College\nand the Union stand to make substantial\nsavings from the increased barrel l age discount and if St Mary's Medical\nSchool choose to join the new system,\nthe order will be the largest in London.\nThe National Student Services\nOrganisation (NSSO) provides similar\ndiscounts to its members, but Imperial's non-affiliation to the NUS has\ndisqualified it from joining the scheme.\nThis could also prevent IC from taking\npart in the proposed UL U central\nsupplying venture.\nICU Deputy President Alan Rose\ncommented that he was \"not looking to\nset up a consortium of London\ncolleges.\"\nExpedition Off\nTHE MOUNTAINEERING Club's Karakoram expedition has been called\noff due to illness.

At a quarter to\ntwelve the Sherfield messengers arrived\nand, explaining that College Secretary\nlohn Smith had asked for the disco to\nend, began to remove people from the\nbuilding. Students complained that\nviolence was used in the process but no\nproceedings are to be taken.\nTEN students who had been allocated\nCollege accommodation this Summer\nwere given only three days notice that\ntheir bookings had been cancelled. The\nproblem was caused by overbooking of\nrooms in the Summer Accommodation\nCentre. The students were not on\nacademic courses and six of them were\nsubsequently offered alternative\naccommodation.

The Queensgate\nTrust (an organisation which provides\nmoney for non academic activities) has\nagreed to meet half of the \u00a39,000 bill\nwhich was temporarily paid by the\nCollege's Activities Loan Scheme.\nThe remaining money was to be\nobtained from the Union by rearranging\nBoat Club's Five Year Plan, but the\nClub did not apply for the release of the\nmoney until after the boat had been\nbought, breaking Union Finance rules.\nThe matter will be discussed further at\nthe next meeting of the Union Finance\nCommittee.\ngiven and the Union organised a 'Crash\nPad'. Although no one used the crash\npad, several students had to stay with\nfriends.\nSome students had very little notice\nthat their application for Summer\nresidence had been turned down. The\nnotices were sent out over a week before\nthe end of term but many only arrived\nthree days before the students were due\nto leave.

    "content": "The credit\nrevolution\nOver the past five years the\nmajor financial institutions have become concerned about\nthe ever-increasing amount of\ncredit card fraud. It seems\nthat \"magnetic strip\" cards\nare easy to decode and many\ncounterfeits are being\nproduced daily. Not only are\nthe banks becoming\ndissatisfied with these\nconventional cards but\nindividual card holders want\nsecurity in their transactions\nand fewer cards to carry.\nThis has led to research into\nsecurity through encryption\n(data secrecy) and\nauthentication (data protection\nagainst unauthorised change).\nThere are three barriers to the\nintroduction of this type of sophisticated\nsystem. The coding has been too\ncomplicated for a layman to use; the\ncards would be an unwieldy size and the\ncost of introduction will be high.\nHowever, a new silicon chip card, which\ncan handle a wider range of applications\nthan any of its wallet-size counterparts,\nhas been recently developed by Siemens\nin Germany. It replaces the long,\nexposed magnetic strip with a chip\nproper identification. To ensure no\ntampering can occur, all data is stored\non an EEPROM which is extremely\nunstable and data is destroyed by any\nexternal scanning energy. The tiny\ncharge carriers in the memory cells are\ninstantly neutral is ed when touched by a probe and if anybody tries to examine\nit under an electron microscope, the data\nchanges in a totally unpredictable\nmanner.\nIn addition a special protective coating\non the chip itself destroys any sensitive\ninformation in the event of a break-in.\nSiemens claim that it is totally\nun hack able. The new 'smart' card is\nfundamentally different from the\nmagnetic strip card in three ways: the\ncard can story any transaction data; data\ncannot be abused; and the card cannot\nbe copied\nIt is hoped that as the card is\nintroduced, it will be used not only as\na cash card but also as an ID card and\nan intelligent key that can only be used\nwhen a PIN has been entered. Siemens\nenvisage the storage of medical histories\n'the smart card\nembedded in plastic to protect it from\ndamage and the elements.\nIt is because of the technology inside\nthis chip that the card can be made\nsecure against manipulation and can\nprevent unauthorised alteration of stored\ndata. Component mini at uris ation has\nmade it possible to pack major\nprocessing power into semiconductor\ndevices the size of a one penny piece and\n. at an affordable cost. The chip contains\na number of sophisticated memories\n(RAM, ROM, EPROM AND\nEEPROM) plus an active\nmicroprocessor capable of executing\ncryptographic algorithms. This enables\nthe card holder to be identified\nunambiguously and guarantees the\nsecurity of transaction data. The\ncard holder will be able to give instant\nproof of authorised access by inserting\nthe card into a point-of-sale (POS)\nterminal and entering a personal\nidentification number (PIN). A check\nwill then be carried out on the\nauthenticity of both the card and the\nterminal. There will be no paperwork\nrequired as all money will be transfered\nautomatically from the purchaser's account to the retailer's, after an\nexchange of electronic signatures. The\nnew card claims to be hack-proof\nbecause it is impossible to decode secret\ndata, such as the PIN, from the card;\naccount data is only accessible to the\ncard holder; and specific data can only\nbe altered on a bank terminal after\non the card holders chip and the\nintegration of the users fingerprints or\nvoice patterns as a further security\nmeasure. They are planning to create a 'super smart' card complete with\nminiature keypad and display.\nThis new card may sound wonderful,\nif a shade big brother ish, but it does have\na few shortfalls. The PIN isn't filed in any central, external memory so if the\ncard holder forgets it, no one can help,\nnot even the bank. The only thing to be\ndone is to throw it away. As well as this,\nof the 13 million smart cards on order,\nless than 1 million have been delivered\nbecause the chip failure rate is still\nunacceptably high. Finally, no matter\nhow secure the chip may be, there is still\nno safeguard against human error, such\nas writing the PIN on the card!\nUndoubtedly a version of this smart\ncard will be introduced into our high\nstreets within the next decade to combat\nthe massive fraud that'soc curing at the\nmoment. However the makers have to\nproduce reliable chips and the banks will\nhave to outlay many millions of pounds\nto install all the POS terminals required.\nThe smart card and its point-of-sale\nterminals are being gradually introduce\ninto West Germany over the next three\nyears. It will be decided after this trial\nperiod whether or not the system is\nviable for worldwide use.\nInformation by courtesy of Siemens\nAktiengesellschaft.\nUNDER! H THE MICROKCOPE\nSuper Ceramics\nHIGH speed computers using ceramic\nsuperconductors may be as little as three\nyears away, according to scientists, and\nthe first devices to make use of the new\ntechnology may be available within\ntwelve months.\nThese are the latest estimates from top\nresearchers six months after a team at\nthe University of Houston developed a material, which exhibited super\nconductivity at 98K(175 \u00b0C). This has\ntriggered widespread interest in\nsuperconductor technology, and has\nprompted several governments to pledge\nmassive financial support for national\nresearch institutions.\nUntil recently superconductivity was\nonly possible in a few materials kept at\nthe temperature of liquid helium, a few\ndegrees above absolute zero (-273\u00b0C). Since the spring of 1986, when a team\nof IBM scientists in Zurich produced a superconductor at 23.2K(250 \u00b0C), ceramic materials which became\nsuperconductors at higher and higher\ntemperatures have been developed.\nThough most of the superconductors\nhave been found to be too unstable for\nany practical application, there are\nwidespread possibilities for\nsuperconductors in the electronics and\nheavy electrical industries.\nGrave Robbing\nA FRENCH expedition to recover\ntreasure from the wreck of the Titanic\nhas been condemned as 'grave robbery'\nby representatives of the Titanic\nHistorical Society.\nThe expedition is being run by the\nFrench Institute for Research and\nExploration of the Sea (IFREMER).\nIn the summer of 1985 this group\nhelped a team from the Woods Hole\nOceanographic Institution to find the\nwreck of die liner. The Woods Hole\nteam, led by marine geologist Robert\nBallard, were able to photograph the\nwreck, and completed their exploration\nin the summer last year. At Ballards\ninstruction, the US Congress declared\nthe Titanic an undersea memorial,\nmaking it illegal to salvage anything\nfrom the wreck. Though the US\nproposed drawing up an international\ntreaty to protect the Titanic, which lies\nin international waters, there was no\nsupport for this from France or the UK.\n8 Friday August 14th1987 FELIX\n\n"

Fourteen years later this July, he\nreturned to Wembley to give new\ngenerations a taste of his many\nmemorable songs.\nThe Bridge Tour set featured\nsurprisingly little of his most recent\nmaterial. Not more than fifteen minutes\nfrom two hours were lent to promoting\nhis latest album. Instead he treated us\nto songs like Uptown Girl, Pressure and\nScenes from an Italian Restaurant.\nMy only disappointment was that he\nhad to have another singer reach his high\nnotes in the earlier songs he performed.\nDespite this and the high ticket prices\n(\u00a315) I would still encourage you to see\nhis excellent live performance when he\nnext tours Great Britain. CM.\nRECORDS\nSkin Games\u2014Cowboy Joe\nLone Justice Wannabees with this\nweek's best of a bad lot. Backing very\nreminiscent of Bad County and lead\nvocalist (Wendy) who can sing. Just one\nreservation; Skin Games is rather an odd\nname for a band, but give them a listen\nanyway.\nThe Cult-Wild Flower\nI 've yet to find anyone who thinks this\nisn't Billy Idol. Nuff said.\nMichael Jackson\u2014\n/ Just Can't Stop Loving You\nStarts with ultra-na ff spoken intro (you\nlook so beautiful tonight etc) moving on\nto a very ordinary duet with Siedah\nCorrett (who?). Following Thriller was\nalways going to be difficult; if the new\nalbum's success means as much to CBS\nrecords as some recent press reports\nindicate, I would sell my shares now...\nPaul King\u2014Follow My Heart\nAt last, something good and somebody\nwho can sing. Buy it, and CBS might\nnot be in so much trouble after all.\nCM.\nTHE PROMS\nUPON mention of the Proms, everyone\nimmediately thinks of the Last Night,\none of the Great British pageants of flag\nwaving, celebration and general\npageantry watched by millions all across\nthe world. But in many ways this overly\nnationalistic and perhaps xenophobic\nfestival is totally atypical of the sixty-six concerts that make up the season.\nThe index of works in the Proms\nGuide resembles a classical AZ with\nmusic from Alain to Zemlinsky passing\nsuch well known composers as\nBeethoven, Handel and Prokofiev as\nwell as a number who are less well\nknown.\nAny one concert is a mix of the\nobscure with the classic, introducing\nnew music with your old favourites.\nThis year the theme of the Proms is\nDance with fifty-three of the concerts\nhaving at least one piece of music to do\nwith dance, including a number of BBC\ncommissions receiving their world\npremiere.\nTickets can be purchased on the door\nfor \u00a31.50 or \u00a32.00. The more expensive\ntickets are for the arena, more\ncommonly associated with the\nPromenade Concerts but this area suffers\nfrom overcrowding and you need to be\nover six feet tall to be able to see\nanything properly unless you are early\nenough to get near the front. The\ncheaper price gains you access to the\nhighest level of the Albeit Hall where\nthere are dubious acoustics, but usually\nplenty of floor space to sit on and a full\nview of the orchestra.\nTonight's prom is by the BBC Welsh\nSymphony Orchestra who are\nperforming excerpts from Glazunov's Roymonda suite, the Violin Concerto in\nD major by Brahms and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 in E minor 'From the\nNew World'. For details of other\nconcerts, the Haldane Library has a copy\nof the prospectus, or you can buy your\nown for \u00a31.50 from good newsagents.\nIf you intend going to more than just a few it's a good investment since\nprogrammes at each concert cost 30p to\npromenaders and contain little extra\ninformation.\nEveryone should experience the Last\nNight at least once. This year's is on\nSeptember 12th and the same \u00a31.50 and\n\u00a32.00 tickets will be available on the\ndoor. However, to qualify you must\nhave similarly-priced ticket stubs from\nat least five other proms and be fairly\nnear the front of the queue, which means\nqueueing much of the day (and previous\nnight). A.B. B00K$=\nMAU*\nMAUS is no ordinary cartoon book. It\ntells the tale of Nazi Germany where\nNazis are cats and Jews are mice. It is\nthe true story of a Jewish survivor but,\nperhaps more than that, it shows how\nthe author is trying to come to terms with\nhis father's history and his life with a Jewish survivor.\nThere are two stories within the\nbeautifully drawn cartoons. The first is\nthe father's story of countless brushes\nwith death and the terror of betrayal.\nThe second reveals Art Spiegelman's tortured relationship with his father as\nthey try to lead a normal life after the\nwar.\nIt's a remarkable work of love\ncombining novel, documentary, memoir\nmd comic book. To be published by\nPenguin on 10th September at \u00a35.95.\nC.J. Rose Atkins\nAl Birch\nDave Colley\nChris Jones\nChris Martin\nRob Sheils\nR.A.A.B. D.C. C.J. CM.\nR.S.
