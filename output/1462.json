Instead she\nwent to the O2 Arena\nto see Pop\u2019s other\ncrazy-fashioned diva,\nwith all elaborate sets\nand aerial acrobatic\ndisplays money can\nbuy.\nJack White takes more of a backseat\nthan ever before, bringing Alison\nMosshart to the helm of this spooky\nyet sultry blues outfit. The album\nkicks off with \u201cBlue Blood Blues\u201d;\nwith bass stomping all over it and\nFertita\u2019s guitar shrieking in discordant yelps. WTF \u2018shake your hips like\nbattleships\u2019 means I\u2019m not quite\nqualifiedtosay,allIknowis,itmoves\nmy bones. \u201cHustle and Cuss\u201d sees\nthem slip into a more chilled groove\nakin to 70s soul band Funkadelic,\nwhich contrasts with the twisting\nsnake-like \u201cThe Difference Between\nUs\u201d driven by Fertita\u2019s Hammond\norgan and Lawrence\u2019s bassline. It\u2019s\nnotable that this album is a more\ncollaborative effort than their first\nalbum, with White restricted to the\nodd burst of showmanship, like his\ndistinctive guitar solo on \u201cGasoline\u201d.\nWhilst several tracks feel unrefined\nand in need of trimming, the overall\nresult is impressive, and serious kudos to them for finishing on a jaunty\ngraveyard theme. - Tom Jennings\nTHE DEAD\nWEATHER\nSEA OF\nCOWARDS\nEMI\nALBUM\nR\night now, the music industry really is all about\nthe girls. Whether you\nlove them or loathe them,\nthere\u2019s no doubt that the\nlikes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, Cheryl\nCole [Ed note: Cheryl Cole?] and co.\nare taking over.\nRiRi has come a long way since she\nfirst exploded onto the scene with Pon\nde Replay in 2005. Only 17 at the time,\nthe song showcased none of her powerful vocal skills, the video was horrendously lacking in style and fashion,\nand, most importantly, you didn\u2019t get\na sense of who Rihanna is. Make no\nmistake \u2013 this girl is not your typical\npop princess, she\u2019s wild, she\u2019s dark,\nshe\u2019s rebellious, and she does whatever the hell she wants to and doesn\u2019t\ngive a toss about what you think about\nit.\nIt may come as a surprise to those\nwho have seen her live performances on youtube, but not only can Rihanna sing in tune, her voice is also\ncompelling and powerful. Starting\nher set with the haunting Russian\nRoulette, the song showcased not\nonly her vocal talents, but her love\nof fashion too, with a black dress\ncovered in red flashing LED lights.\nThe set was comprised of all the\nbig hits from her last two albums,\nas well as some of the lesser-known\nsongs from her latest.\nMemorable moments included\nher performance of \u2018Hard\u2019 on top\nof a neon pink army tank, the mini-Rihanna\nO2 Arena\n11th May\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nrave she and her dancers had inside\na neon cube for \u2018Please Don\u2019t Stop\nthe Music\u2019, and the emotional ballads \u2018Take a Bow\u2019 and \u2018Rehab\u2019 where\none look at her face clearly showed\nexactly who she was singing these\nsongs about.\nHer costume changes ranged from\nLady Gaga-esque leotards to big\nstatement shoulders, asymmetrical\nbody suits to gem studded FMBs,\nand her on-stage dancing and general behavior was at all times enthralling \u2013 she was clearly having fun and\nthe crowd was having fun with her.\nThis is one girl who definitely deserves all the attention she\u2019s getting.\n- Mariam Zahedi\nDon\u2019t know\nwhat to listen\nto while\nrevising? Read\nthis week\u2019s\nreviews...\nKEANE/K\u2019NAAN\nSTOP FOR A\nMINUTE\nUNIVERSAL\nSINGLE\nI thought I hated this song and then\nit got stuck in my head and now it is\ngrowing on me. Completely unlike\nanything they have done before, it still\nhas the distinctive piano riffs but with\nthe added hip-hop vibe. It is definitely\nmore accessible than their previous efforts and is very radio-friendly... AND\nmy burlesque teachers are in the vid-eo! Ha.\n- Emily Beech\nRonnie James Dio\nThe 16th of May was a very black sabbath indeed.\nB\nlack Sabbath ring any bells?\nRainbow? Well if they don\u2019t\nthey should, and if they\ndo, then so should Ronnie\nJames Dio, the heavy metal legend\nwho fronted Rainbow and later Black\nSabbath post Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s foolish decision to leave. He died at the\nage of 67 last Sunday from stomach\ncancer, and will go down in history\nfor his contribution to rock, popularizing the \u201cdevil\u2019s horns\u201d gesture,\nthat has kept rock n\u2019 rollers moshing\nand mere popstars shaking in their\nspaceboots.\nI can\u2019t explain how much of a loss\nthis is to the music world. Dio, was\nthe metal behind Rainbow, leaving\nthe band in 1973 because, well... they\nweren\u2019t rock enough for him. He\njoined Black Sabbath in 1979 having been suggested by Sharon Osbourne (daughter of the Black Sabbath manager), and replaced Ozzy.\nHe gave the group a new energy and\nforce which led them to success and\na new attitude. He had a differnt style\nto Ozzy, and would make the vocal part\nhis own, singing across the riffs rather\nthan along with them like Ozzy.\nDio later broke away from Black Sabbath and formed a band called \u2018Dio\u2019\nwith Sabbath drummer. Releasing ten\nalbums with his self-titled band and\nRonnie James Dio being the only constant member throughout, he moved\non to form his current band, \u2018Heaven\nand Hell\u2019, in 2006, with Tony Iommi,\nGeezer Butler and Vinny Appice.\nHe was at the heart of the international metal family, with the well\nknown \u201cdevil\u2019s horns\u201d a trademark,\nwhich he claims was to ward off evil\nspirits, unfortunately the \u2018evil spirits\u2019\ngot to him before his time was up. His\nwife announced his death stating; \u201cToday my heart is broken, Ronnie passed\naway at 7.45am 16th May. Many, many\nfriends and family were able to say their\nprivate goodbyes before he peacefully\npassed away. Ronnie knew how much\nhe was loved by all.\u201d\nHaving a name meaning \u2018God\u2019 in\nItalian and a cameo appearence in\nTenacious D\u2019s film, \u201cThe Pick of Destiny\u201d, it was clear that he knew what\nhis purpose was on this Earth and\nnow, although he may be gone, his\nrole in the world of rock was epic, as\nwas he. -Luke Turner\n\n"

    "content": "UNION ENTS COMMITEE\nW\nith the opening of Metric next year,\nit will be vital to ensure that the new\nvenue doesn\u2019t suffer the disastrous\nreputation that dBs had.\nPromotion: One of my priorities as a member of\nthe ents committee will be to establish an effective\npromotion network for union events and to extend\nthis network to clubs, societies and faculty unions\nwho decide to host events.\nDrinks Deals: Aside from slightly cheaper pints\non a Wednesday, there is generally no creativity in\nproviding drinks promotions. Simple changes such\nas happy hours, cocktail jugs or cheaper shots will\nmake a massive difference.\nMusic: For the new venue to be attractive to a\nbroad demographic of Imperial students I aim to\npush for a wide variety of music to be played, including live acts.\nHaving worked at a variety of bars and clubs, including the union for 2 years, I have the experience\nto make Metric a success.\nAlistair Owen\nI\n\u2019m Christopher Schlumberger-Socha and I am\nrunning for a position in the Entertainments\nCommittee.\nI\u2019m very excited about the Phase 3 development plans (\u201chttp://bit.ly/Phase3Blog\u201d),\nand can\u2019t wait for it to be finished so we can\nuse our new space. Metric has the potential to\nbecome an amazing club venue, both for Union\nand society events! Working on the Entertainments Committee, we\u2019ll filter through society\u2019s\nrequests and organise the calendar so that YOU\nget the best club nights!\nAs well as an avid clubber, I\u2019ve previously been\na senior technician and floor manager at the QEII\nPerforming Arts Centre. I\u2019ve had to organise and\nmanage external companies using our space, and I\nknow the difference between and successful night,\nand a flop! I think I have the necessary skill to be in\nthe committee and that I can bring a valuable contribution to it.\nVOTE Christopher Schlumberger-Socha for Entertainments Committee Member!\nChristopher Schlumberger-Socha\nC\nlubs and societies hosting their own\nevents in Metric is something that\u2019s\nboth exciting and really important.\nClubs will never be short of enthusiasm or people-power, and I hope to be part of\nhelping them maximise their potential. As part\nof the new entertainments committee, I would\nplace enthusiasm and a positive attitude top pri-ority. I\u2019d like to create an events handbook with\nall the information and contacts that societies\nneed. I\u2019d also push for those clubs with exceptional proven records to be given a chance on a\nFriday or Wednesday evening. My progressive\nand open attitude mean I\u2019d be great for the job.\nHaving spent three years involved with putting\non society events in dB\u2019s, I\u2019ve also learnt what\nworks and what doesn\u2019t. Most of all, I\u2019ve learnt\nhow many good ideas are out there in the student body.\nDavid Trevelyan\nH\naving become sickened by the infectious\nspread of the simile \u201cdark and empty,\nlike a party at Imperial College\u201d, I\u2019m applying for Ents Committee to make the\ndismal social life a thing of the past, and to ensure\nthe Union is the envy of all other universities. Variety is definitely the spice of life so, in terms of society run nights, I\u2019m going to be pretty open-minded.\nThe more original the idea, the better, as long as I\nthink people will be game.\nAlthough Sports nights are on Wednesdays, I\nthink sports teams should be encouraged to organise Tuesday and Saturday nights, but equally\nif Knitting Society want to throw a crazy \u201cVicars\nand Farmyard Animals\u201d party, who\u2019s going to stop\nthem? Not me.\nI can see a future where the Union is the new\nMinistry. King\u2019s students will beg to come party\nwith us. And we will say no.\nLuke Foreman\nkeep\nup-to-date\nwith\nphase 3\nBlog\nPhase 3\nimperialcollegeunion.org/phase3\nVote online from 24-27 May\nimperialcollegeunion.org/vote\n\n"

This week,\ntwo different initiatives got underway\nto help cut waste in food outlets on\ncampus.\nReusable cups are now on sale in the\nJunior and Senior Common Rooms\nfor just \u00a32.50, which can be used when\nbuying hot drinks at any of the College catering outlets. The cups must\nbe clean when they are presented to\nCatering staff but as an incentive, customers will be given two stamps on\ntheir College loyalty card every time\nthey reuse their cup. This scheme is\nthe direct result of the consultation by\nthe StepChange campaign last month\nwhen lots of people pointed to disposable take-away cups as a culprit of unnecessary waste.\nAnother project unveiled this week\nis an on-campus composter which will\ntake one tonne of food waste from\nfood outlets every week, including all\nof the hot food waste. The compost\nwill then be used on college grounds.\nThe CompPod which can be transported around to where it is needed,\nis the size of a portacabin and contains\nall the equipment necessary to treat\nRox Middleton\nRox Middleton and convert food waste to a compost\nof a quality which satisfies the British\nStandards Institution. It has been developed using research from the College\u2019s Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, and cost Imperial\n\u00a3140,000 which, it is claimed, can be\nrecovered in just two years.\nThe research was led by Professor\nGrimes who said it was \u201cvery satisfying to see our concept translate directly into a practical green solution here\non our own campus\u201d. The CompPod\nwill contribute to the aim of reducing\nrubbish sent to landfill by 40% during\n2010 and will also save College money\non Landfill and transportation charg-es. The Imperial College website does\nnot detail, however, the extra electricity and water required to make the\ncomposter work.\nThese measures are just two of the\nmultiple schemes being implemented\nto change Imperial for the better, but\nit\u2019s slow progress.

I\u2019ve also had a lot of experience\nat chairing meetings, including the Recreational\nClubs Committee and the Clubs & Societies Board.\nMy aims for the role would be to better advertise\nwhen meetings are, what the outcomes were, and\nwhat that means to students.

More\ntalented people that is. Well, I\u2019m representing RON, Re-Open Nominations at this year\u2019s Summer Elections. ROFLZZZ! So if you think I\u2019m cool and the\nother people are useless, vote for RON. Get it?\nI mean, all the people on these pages are probably just as talentless as me. Once\nI lose my adorable baby-face looks, I\u2019ve just a non-career in heroin and short-lived\nmarriages lined up. It\u2019s true, my mommy says I have. These cretins on the other\nhand, don\u2019t. They lose this election, they have the prospect of another year at Imperial College. They are the type that strive on responsibility, and without it, they\nshrivel up like slugs and things. I learn about slugs in school. YAY! SLUGS R KOOL.\nOhmigod! I\u2019ve just read their manifestos, and LOLLERS, they\u2019re useless. Maybe\nit\u2019s cos I haven\u2019t learnt to read yet, but I just pretend I can anyway.\nWho needs a Deputy President of Education. We don\u2019t need no education.

VOTE BIEBER (AND HIS GF)!!!111!!\nCAG CHAIR\nH\nello! Many of you may not know what\nthe CAG Chair actually does; so I\u2019ll give\nyou a little heads up before asking you\nto vote for me. In the past few years, the\nCAG Chair, and the function of the Community Action Group has essentially been to run a soup kitchen in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields on Sundays, to provide a\nrefugee centre with sustenance through FoodCycle\n(formerly Foodworks) by recycling unwanted raw\ningredients and then just last year to oversee the\nformation of IC Buddies. Next year, we want to do\nso much more. The Union has been working with\nCAG, essentially a volunteering-coordinating body,\nto figure out a way to facilitate volunteering within\nthe community around Imperial College. Next year,\nif elected, I will make volunteering a more streamlined process. No more worrying about CRBs, insurance or whether someone else from Imperial is\nalready doing this and that there and then. For club\nofficers looking to organise some volunteering, this\nshould make your lives much easier as we\u2019ll already\nhave the answers you\u2019re looking for.\nAs treasurer of the group this year, I\u2019ve seen the\ndifficulties faced by the chair as well as the opportunities to make a difference. Give me the chance\nto realise those opportunities. Vote for Nicolas\nMassie.\nNicolas Massie\nNOT SUBMITTED\nWeili Dong\nP\nh\no\nt\no\nn\no\nt\ns\nu\nb\nm\ni\nt\nt\ne\nd\n\n"

    "content": "17\nfelix FRIDAY 21 MAY 2010\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\ning the tune in determining the shape of\nthe government of the United Kingdom.\nUnder PR, this situation is likely to be a\npermanent feature, and the inglorious\nbackroom deals that have been done in the\npast few days, perpetual.\nHowever, when Mr. Clegg went to Labour to ask them for PR they told him no.\nWhen Mr. Clegg went to the Conservatives they said almost the same thing but\noffered the Alternative Vote or \u2018AV\u2019 in-stead. Before we go through the intricacies\nof AV, it must be noted that an AV referendum motion would have to pass through\nParliament, which is far from a sure thing\nsince neither Labour nor the Tories really\nwant it \u2013 it exists primarily to appease\nthe Liberal Democrats. If it did, only then\nwould it be subject to the people.\nThe AV is very much like the First-Pastthe-Post (FPTP) system. Like FPTP, it is\nused to elect representatives for single-member constituencies, except that rather\nthan simply marking one solitary \u2018X\u2019 on\nthe ballot paper, the voter has the chance\nto rank the candidates on offer. In some\nAV elections, such as most Australian\nelections, electors are required to rank all\ncandidates, explains the Electoral Reform\nSociety (ERS). AV also differs from FPTP\nin the way votes are counted. Like FPTP,\na candidate who has won an absolute majority of the votes (50 per cent plus one) is\nimmediately elected.\nHowever, if no candidate has an absolute\nmajority, under AV the candidate with\nthe lowest number of first preferences is\n\u2018eliminated\u2019 from the count, and his or her\nballots are examined for their second pref-erences. Each ballot is then transferred to\nwhichever remaining candidate has the\nhighest preference in the order as marked\non the ballot paper. This process is repeated until one candidate has an absolute ma-jority, and is declared duly elected.\nOne advantage of transferring ballots is\nthat it enables the votes of several aligned\ncandidates to accumulate, so that diverse\nbut related interests can be combined to\nwin representation. The Alternative Vote\nalso enables supporters of candidates who\nhave little hope of being elected to influ-ence, via their second and later prefer-ences, the election of a major candidate.\nFor this reason, it is sometimes argued\nthat AV is the best system for dealing with\nelections in deeply divided societies, as it\ncan compel candidates to seek not only\nthe votes of their own supporters but also\nthe \u2018second preferences\u2019 of others.\nAll MPs would have the support of a\nmajority of their constituents. It more accurately reflects public opinion of extremist parties, who are unlikely to gain many\nsecond-preference votes. It also eliminates\nthe need for tactical voting. Electors can\nvote for their first-choice candidate without fear of wasting their vote and it encourages candidates to chase second- and\nthird-preferences, which lessens the need\nfor negative campaigning and rewards\nbroad-church policies, says the ERS.\nHowever, AV is potentially less proportional than FPTP. It turns politics into a\ngame of second preferences. Politicians\ncan discard voters\u2019 immediate concerns,\nand rely on picking up their second pref-erences. Far from allowing an increasingly\nconsumerist electorate a wider spectrum\nof choice, AV mitigates against niche and\ndistinctive voter choice. It will leave a politics that is even more bland and generic.\nFPTP allows the largest coherent group to\nrule if it is large enough, even if it does not\ncommand a majority of voters.\nAnother way to put this same point is\nthat FPTP tends to produce outcomes focused around what people want, not what\nthey oppose. AV produces outcomes in\nwhich people vote against things, ordering\ntheir preferences such that what they dislike most comes last. But what is disliked\nis irrelevant \u2013 all that counts is whether\nenough of you agree on some specific\nthing you think is better. It does very little to improve the voice of traditionally\nunder-represented groups in Parliament,\nstrengthening the dominance of the \u2018central\u2019 viewpoint. There is no transfer of\npower from party authority to the voters.\nIt is prone to a certain amount of \u2018Donkey\nvoting\u2019, where voters rank candidates ran-domly, not knowing enough about all of\nthem to make an informed decision.\nIn 1997, 2001, 2005 and sort-of 2010 the\nTories lost. They lost a lot more in the\nprevious three elections when they then\nnaturally blamed the system. They, like\nClegg, have a point here. The FPTP System\nis massively biased against the Tories. The\nonly people it really works for currently\nis Labour and they crashed and burned\nanyway, as expected. Labour won the 2001\nelection with 412 MPs against 166 Conservative MPs, and a landslide majority\nof 165, but with a lead of only 9 points in\nthe popular vote. John Major\u2019s Conservatives had a popular vote lead of not much\nless \u2013 7.5 percentage points \u2013 but a paltry\nmajority of 21 and 336 MPs compared to\nLabour\u2019s 271 when they won in 1992.\nUnder the current system for electing\nMPs to the House of Commons, there are\n650 separate constituencies across the UK\neach electing one single Member of Parliament. In order to vote you simply put an\n\u2018X\u2019 next to the name of the candidate you\nsupport. The candidate who gets the most\nvotes wins, regardless of whether he or she\nhas more than 50% support. Once members have been individually elected, the\nparty with the most seats in Parliament,\nagain regardless of whether or not it has a\nmajority across the country, normally becomes the next government.\nOnly one MP is elected in each con-stituency, so all the voters who did not\nvote for him or her are not represented.\nTheir votes do not help elect anybody and\nso are wasted, they could have stayed at\nhome and the result would not have been\naltered. In 2005 19 million voters cast ineffective votes - that is 70% of those who\nvoted.\nA high proportion of these voters are\nthe same people every time, e.g. Conservative voters in County Durham or Labour\nvoters in much of Surrey. Voters are represented unequally. Concentrated support\nfor a party produces results.\nThe way the boundaries of constituencies are drawn can affect the results according to the Electoral Commission.\nGovernments are often accused of ger-rymandering, adjusting the boundaries\nof constituencies to influence the results.\nThe FPTP is not a bad system but has been\nmanhandled into electoral oblivion by\nopportunist politicians over the past dec-ades. Over 60 countries, with almost half\nof the world\u2019s electors, employ FPTP, and\nonly 0.5% of electors vote using the Alternative Vote (AV) and only 0.1% by the Single Transferable Vote (STV).\nThe Alternative Vote Plus (AV+) devised\nby the Jenkins Commission is not used\nin any country. FPTP tends to lead to a\ntwo-party system. The system tends to\nproduce single party governments, which\nare strong enough to create legislation and\ntackle the country\u2019s problems, without relying on the support of any other party. It\nprovides a close link between the MP and\ntheir constituency. The system represents\nthe views of the people, as the candidate\nwith the greatest support wins through a\nfair process.\nWhat is more, the current government\nis committed to cutting the number of\nMPs by 10% and redrawing boundaries so\nthe system becomes fair again (assuming\nthere is no gerrymandering, and that assumption should not be made). Moreover\nit allows voters to choose between people\nrather than just between parties. Voters\ncan assess the performance of individual\ncandidates rather than just having to accept a list of candidates presented by a\nparty, as can happen under some List PR\nelectoral systems, and more importantly\ngives a chance for popular independent\nor minor party candidates to be elected \u2013\nlike the Green Party\u2019s first MP selected for\nBrighton.\nWhile it does form a strong majority\ngovernment, the same is true for the opposition save for the majority; it gives rise\nto a coherent opposition in the legislature.\nIn theory, the flip side of a strong single-party government is that the opposition is\nalso given enough seats to perform a critical checking role and present itself as a realistic alternative to the government of the\nday. It advantages broadly based political\nparties.\nUnder the Bill of Rights 1688, the vote\ngranted the electorate the power to lawfully sack those who tax them and make\nthe laws. Proportional representation\nwould make that impossible, and if you\ncannot sack those who tax you and make\nlaws, you are not free.\nThe laws uphold the people\u2019s rights and\nliberties and protect them against the otherwise potentially tyrannical power of the\nstate (this has not really worked so well in\nthe UK under New Labour one is afraid\nto say). This, allied to the Act of Habeas\nCorpus of 1679, effectively puts the citizen\nabove the state. There has been no revolution since 1688 in England or the UK. No\nother state in the EU has a constitution\npre-dating VE Day May 1945, and France\nhas had more than 20 constitutions since\n1789.\nThese are profound questions that do\nnot lend themselves to a quick fix merely\nto oblige a minority party in return for its\nsupport in the Commons voting lobbies.\nMr. Cameron was right to offer an all-par-ty review; it needs to be wide-ranging, and\ncertainly not rushed.\nThe Liberal Democrats wielded disproportionate negotiating power over what is\nnow the first coalition government since\n1945. It will most likely not last more than\na year. Both sides have had to sacrifice a\nlot, and settle for something they do not\nbelieve in; head not heart, supposedly for\nthe good of the country.\nWhat now passes for a majority rightwing government is more left wing than\nthe one in 1970s. Only time will tell if that\ngrand homage to the nation was really\ntrue or just desperate opportunism from\ndesperate politicians aching for a spell\nat power. The British voters supposedly\nwanted a different kind of politics, well,\nthat is certainly what they got.\n\u201c...if you cannot sack\nthose who tax you\nand make laws, you\nare not free.\u201d\nVoting reforms could revolutionise choosing No. 10\u2019s residents\n\u201cHowever AV is\npotentially less\nproportional than\nFPTP\u201d\n\n"

Really?\nL\nast week, I had the pleasure of attending Hush\nat the Royal Albert Hall.\nHush is a series of concerts every few months\nfeaturing indie rock bands hosted in\nthe Elgar Room, formally a Victorian\nrestaurant that was recently transformed into a performance space and\nbar with capacity for 250 persons. It is\na surprisingly fun and intimate venue\nin which to experience a concert; be\nsure to try the hot dog. Jazz events\nare also hosted in this room every few\nweeks.\nThe first act was a Canadian band,\nthe Rural Albert Advantage. Some of\nthe Postal Service-like synth sounds\nand rhythms present on their critically\nacclaimed album, \u201cHometowns\u201d were\nabsent from this performance. In their\nplace was perhaps something more\npowerful, an energetic performance\ncentred around frontman Paul Banwatt\u2019s acoustic guitar that conveyed\na genuine yearning for simplicity and\nwilderness, fitting for a band based\nin Toronto but named for a western\nprarie province, that left this author\nyearning for the simplicity and down-home comfort of the New World. Of\nnote was vocalist Amy Cole\u2019s percussion and the Banwatt\u2019s delivery of a\ncover of \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d, which can\nbe found on the band\u2019s most recent\nsingle.\nSinger songwriter Anna Calvi, sort\nof a female, highly attractive version\nof Nick Cave, gave an excellent performance successfully melding her\ngorgeous electric guitar, mysterious\nvocals, backup guitar and percussion\nfrom Mally Harpaz and drumming\nby Daniel Maiden-Wood. Musicology expert and chemical engineer\nTomi Herceg was quoted as saying\nthat Calvi \u201cneeds to open her eyes\nmore while performing.\u201d Particularly\nintriguing was Calvi\u2019s performance of\n\u201cLove Won\u2019t Be Leaving\u201d, another performance of which can be found on\nYouTube.\nHeadlining act Peggy Sue turned\nout to be slightly disappointing only\nin that I had been expecting a Buddy\nHolly and the Crickets tribute band.\nWhen I learned that I was not in for an\nhour of the sounds before rock started\n\u201cgoin\u2019 downhill\u201d, according to John\nMilner, the amount of time the band\ntook to setup led some audience mem-bers, including myself, to believe that\nwe were in fact about to experience a\nsurprise appearance by the Bob Dylan\nwho, apparently like Peggy Sue, takes\na long time to set up. What instead\nresulted was an hour minus setup time\nof thoughtful and contemplative rock\nthat on second thought was broodish\nand whiny. This shift in my humble\nopinion did not occur perhaps until\nthe band whipped out its accordion, a\nshow of force that to me represented\nthe band\u2019s attempt to appease or awe\nthe hipsters in the audience. The accordion in fact seemed to ruin what\ncould have been a perfectly fine song.\nThe band recently crossed 1.5 million\nplays on MySpace, so perhaps the accordion is working. I should caveat\nmy displeasure in the band was not\nbecause they are poor musicians; they\nare excellent. Instead, I was lost in its\nmelancholy. Perhaps as a result, Peggy\nSue could appeal to many mechanical\nengineers and other unsatisfied Imperial students and staff.\n-Tom Greany\nI see an accordion... and a violin... and a double bass...

The decision to\nmake these cuts was made last year,\nwith them coming into full effect at the\nstart of the next academic year.\nIn December 2009, Alistair Darling\nannounced in his pre-budget report\nthat universities and higher education\ninstitutes would have to collectively\nmake \u00a3600m in savings.\nA recent survey in the Financial\nTimes, which looked at around 40\nUK higher education institutes, found\nthat a reduction in staff was planned\nto take place in 16 departments for\nSTEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects. These staff\ncuts will be across the board, affecting\nboth academic and support staff, and\nin some cases staff cuts have already\ntaken place this year.\nAccording to the Higher Education\nFunding Council for England (HE-FCE), 99 out of 131 academic institutions are currently facing a drop in\nfunding from the government.\nAt a time of turbulent politics and\nnational deficit, STEM subjects will\ninevitably be targeted because they\nrequire expensive facilities and equipment in teaching and research.\nAccording to Richard Lambert, director general of CBI (Confederation\nof the British Industry), \u201cscience subjects are more expensive to teach than\narts subjects, but they are of huge value\nto the economy\u201d. It is feared that making these funding cuts in a key potential workforce will hinder the British\neconomy from its recovery from the\nrecession, and will not help economic\ngrowth. STEM subjects have previously been targeted by the government\nfor completely different reasons, and\nwith opposite intentions.\nIn the 2004 Budget, the government\npublished the consultation document\n\u201cScience & Innovation: working towards a ten-year investment framework\u201d, supported by over 200 organisations including Imperial College,\nwhich set out to encourage the sciences\ntowards economic growth and public\nservices over 10 years, ending in 2014.\nIt seems that the unanticipated financial problems within the government\nover the past 12 months have meant\nthat many aspects of scientific education needs to suffer funding cuts. Gail\nCardew, from the Royal Institution of\ndepartment was wasting money.\u201d Despite this so-called money wasting,\nthe King\u2019s UCU Executive Committee\ndisagree with the decision to close the\nengineering department, concerned\nthat King\u2019s College has made a \u201cshortsighted decision that it will come to\nregret later\u201d.\nWe need not feel penalised for\nstudying sciences and engineering at\nImperial: it appears that regardless of\nsubject area, a reduction of up to 25\nper cent in long-term funding for universities is expected in the near future.\nAccording to an Imperial College\nspokesperson, \u201cImperial is in a robust\nfinancial situation.\u201d Imperial have reduced all budgets by 5% for the current financial year and postponed\nthe development of the new Exhibition Road building. Rector Sir\nKeith O\u2019Nions was not terribly\ndisappointed with the funding allocations annouced in\nMarch 2010, as he believes\nthat \u201cuniversities with a critical mass of excellent interdisciplinary research groups\ncan continue to make important contributions to the\ncountry\u2019s health, quality of life\nand economic competetiveness.\u201d\ns\ns\nne\ney.\u201d Dew\nwastin\nng,\nm\nmmitte\nee\nclo\nose th\nhe\nncerne\ned\na \u201cshor\nrt-co\nome to\nis\nsed fo\nfor\ner\nring at\nrd\ndless of\nup\np to 2\n25\nf\nfor un\nnir futur\nre.\nC\nColleg\nge\nr\nrobus\nst\nav\nve ree c\ncur-on\nned\nxh\nhi-Si\nir\nly\ny\n-fe\ne\ns.\n.\u201d\nLib Dems concede fees pledge\nGreat Britain, an independent charity dedicated to connecting people\nwithin the world of science, claims: \u201cBy\n2014 there will be more than 2m extra jobs which need STEM skills\u201d, but\nthe current cuts facing STEM subjects\nwill not be able to provide this future\nworkforce.\nHowever, action to downsize is not\nalways a result of government cuts.\nKing\u2019s College have plans to close its\n172-year-old engineering faculty, and\nit cites competition as being the main\nreason: \u201cThere are great engineering schools elsewhere in London. The\n\u201cSTEM subjects\nrequire expensive\nfacilities and\nequipment\u201d\nA\ns the new coalition government settles down\nafter the post-election\ndealing and debat-ing, one issue that still\nisn\u2019t clearly defined is that of higher\neducation.\nMany have criticised what is perceived to be a significant U-turn by\nthe Liberal Democrats with the recent news that its MPs will be able to\nabstain from voting in the House of\nCommons on higher education should\nthey disagree with what is proposed.\nThe Lib Dems have been forced to\nconcede several of their high profile\nelection campaign promises, including the gradual removal of tuition fees,\nearned citizenship for illegal migrants\nand the removal of the costly Trident\nnuclear defence programme.\nDespite some victories with regards\nto political reform and a tentative\nstep towards a possible change in the\nvoting system, many Lib Dem voters,\nespecially those who have voted for\nthe first time this year, have been left\nfeeling short-changed at their lack of\npushing policies through the coalition,\nespecially regarding higher education.\nThis is an added blow to students\nand academic groups following the\nrecent controversy surrounding the\nRussell Group\u2019s confidentiality in Lord\nBrowne\u2019s review on higher education\nfees. Crucially, the Browne Review, as\nreported in last week\u2019s felix, is likely to\nheavily influence future policy on tuition fees.\nShould Lord Browne recommend\nraising tuition fees, it is possible that\nthe Lib Dems will provide no opposing votes against the Conservatives in\nfavour of abstaining. Higher education\npolicy could therefore be entirely influenced by the Conservative Party in the\nfuture.\nIt is well documented that the Conservatives hold lifting the cap on tuition fees in a favourable light.\nAlthough the Lib Dem\u2019s proposed \u00a32\nbillion extra per year for higher education was an unlikely proposal with\nmass cuts required in spending across\ngovernment, the literal removal of the\nLib Dems from providing any real opposition to their coalition partners\nhave angered supporters.\nWith the coalition government still\nfinding its feet and the conclusions\nfrom the Browne Review approaching,\nthe issue of higher education is likely to\nprove contentious in both government\nand amongst the public as individual\npolicies begin to come under intense\nscrutiny. - Matt Colvin\n\n"

The ward is filled with labour camp (gulag) veterans, civil servants and students alike: the tumours\nafflicting them symbolic of the moral\nburden carried by those who were instrumental in bringing millions suspected of posing a threat to Stalinism\nto their deaths in his Great Purge of\n1937-8.\nSolzhenitsyn\u2019s underlying contempt\nfor Soviet state control is obvious.\nCancer Ward is also a commentary\non the state of Russia and its people.\nRather like the animals in the zoo that\nprotagonist and ex-con Kostoglotov\n(literally, \u201cbone-chewer\u201d) visits upon\nhis release, the Russia people are no\nlonger fit to live outside captivity.\nSlow moving and deliberate, one is\nright there throughout the novel with\nthe patients, having their radiation\ntreatment, going through the agony of\ninjections, feeling the thaw of frost as\nspring emerges and gasping under the\nbaking sun as Kostoglotov is set free\nfrom the ward, only to find the outside\nworld gaudy and overwhelming. (Solz-henitsyn also harshly criticised what\nhe saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant pop culture of\nthe modern West).\nDespite the feeling of malaise that\nis presented so vividly throughout the\nnovel, there is also a strong sense of\ncourage, endurance and hope that survives \u2013 highlighted by Kostoglotov falling in love with medical student Zoya\nand the doctor Vera Gangart.\nSolzhenitsyn\u2019s own experiences are\nmirrored by the bone-chewer\u2019s: he,\ntoo, was sent to a labour camp under Article 58 for writing derogatory\ncomments about Stalin in a letter to a\nfriend.

How much and the way students\npay are topics of intense discussion across\nthe country. Nerves are already shredding as universities are due to receive across-the-board public funding\ncuts of \u00a3600 million from as early as next year, leaving\nthe onus of tuition funding on students themselves.\nThat is exactly what people are expecting to happen after a cross-party review on university funding\nis completed this Autumn. The review, led by ex-BP\nChief Executive Lord Browne, will advise the Government on how to overhaul the current university funding systems.\nUniversity chiefs insist students must contribute\nmore than ever before towards the cost of their degree.\nThey argue it is necessary to not only keep British universities amongst some of the world\u2019s best, but also to\npull the UK out of recession.\nfelix focuses in on the current state of play in higher\neducation that are interest to current and future Imperial students.\nUniversity. \u2018\u2019The taxpayer continues\nto foot the majority of the costs of undergraduate degrees and this is unfair\u2019\u2019\nthey mentioned.\n\u2018\u2019Higher fees are the only answer\u2019\u2019, the\nGroup emphasised. Cambridge University has warned that current fees are\ntoo low for it to remain world-leading,\nwhich has led to a dependency on income from overseas students who pay\nmore. Piatt added that \u2018\u2019while the UK\nwas cutting University budgets by more\nthan \u00a31 billion by 2013, China, South\nKorea and Singapore were increasing their public investment in Higher\nEducation\u2019\u2019.\nThe submission argued that \u2018\u2019the lack\nof a real rate of interest on student loans\nis a subsidy which imposes high costs\non the government and which exceeds\nthe requirements of ensuring fair access\nto higher education.\u2019\u2019 The three ways in\nwhich Universities could reduce their\nannual deficits outlined by the report\nwere to either reduce staff, recruit more\noverseas students or increase tuition\nfees. This is accompanied by the suggestion of allowing richer graduates the\nability to pay back loans earlier and at a\nhigher interest rate.\nSections of the submission outlined\nthe need for increased graduate contributions to be additional to public fund-ing, recognising that STEM subjects\nS\ntudents of the Aldwych Group have issued\na press release indicating that the Russell\nGroup\u2019s proposals to lift the cap on tuition\nfees is widely opposed by their students.\nEmmanuel Akpan-Inwang, Chair of the Aldwych\nGroup said:\n\u2018\u2019I am appalled to hear that the Russell Group has\nadvised the Browne Review to raise tuition fees to\na level high enough to create a true market in the\nsector. The Russell Group has failed miserably to put\nforward any case which suggests that a rise in fees\nwould benefit access to or the quality of education.\nIn fact, the Russell Group\u2019s suggestions jeopardise\nfair access to higher education.\u2019\u2019\nNews of proposed commercial interest rates for\nloans to students raised fears of mortgage style\ndebts. He continued to add:\n\u2018\u2019For the Russell Group to ask for the application of\nreal interest rates to repayments is short-sighted\nandincrediblyregressive.TheBrowneReviewneeds\nto ensure that there is a progressive restructuring of\nthe system that is both beneficial for universities\nand students.\u2019\u2019\nStudents: We disagree\nwith lifting cap on fees\nAldwych Group Chair\nEmmanuel Apkan-Inwang led a\nmarch to the Russell Group offices\nlast week to protest against the\nconfidentiality of the universities\u2019\nsuggestions to the Browne\nReview. Now made publically\navailable, he has criticised the\nRussell Group further.\nWhat does Imperial College Union make of the Russell Group\u2019s submission?\nU\nnion President Ashley Brown has commented on IC Union\u2019s stance on the\nproblem. He mentioned that the core\nprinciples in the report unsurprisingly\noutlined how Russell Group Universities need\nmore money and how graduates could contribute\nmore towards the cost of their education.\n\u201cThe main issue,\u201d he commented, \u201carises with\nhow the Russell Group propose to resolve the student loans problem.\u201d\nThe government currently provides loans at an\ninterest rate of 0%, such that the loan does not\ncover the cost of providing the money; the Government loses money on every student it lends to.\nThe proposed solution is to fix the loan at the current level, but to provide \u2018\u2019top up\u2019\u2019 loans with higher rates of interest, either through the Student\nLoans Company, universities selling bonds or arranging for banks to provide loans. He continued\nto warn that all three schemes rely on graduates\nhaving sufficiently high salaries to pay back the\n\u201cIt is clearly undesirable\nfor graduates to leave\nuniversity with upwards\nof \u00a360,000 of debt\u201d\n\u00a360,000\nThe possible average\ngraduate\u2019s debts after Review\n\u00a39,000\nA proposed tuition fee\nincrease\nImperial College Union\nPresident Ashley Brown\ntook part in the Aldwych\nGroup\u2019s protest last week.\nHe has stated that the\nRussell Group\u2019s take on\ntuition fees and loans is\nnot reflected by the Union\nloans with interest.\nOn behalf of the Union, he said that \u2018\u2019IC Union\u2019s\ncurrent policy on fees opposes any attempt to lift\nthe cap, so we are at odds with them on that point.\nWe do not currently have a policy on loan interest\nrates, other than being supportive of the current\nloan arrangements, but it is clearly undesirable\nfor graduates to leave university with upwards of\n\u00a360,000 of debt, most of it with a commercial rate\nof interest.\u2019\u2019 He praised their recommendations\nto increase the teaching grant for \u2018\u2019strategically\nimportant\u2019\u2019 subjects such as Science and Engineering, which would be paid for by reducing the\ngrant on subjects such as Law. \u201cThe introduction\nof tuition fees (at \u00a31,100) and then top-up fees (at\n\u00a33,000) saw students become more like consum-ers, with corresponding higher demands. These\ndemands will increase with fees, so it is vital that\ncentral government support is maintained, rather\nthan making students pay the full costs. Higher\nEducation provides benefits not just to graduates,\nbut to the economy and society as a whole.\u2019\u2019\nare severely underfunded. Suggestions included bonds directly linked\nto graduate repayments and selling\nUniversity annuities. The latter would\nresult in smaller-risk premiums with\nmore money for universities to invest.\nHowever, they would bear all the risk\nif graduate repayments were lower\nthan expected and the cost of borrowing depends on institutions\u2019 current financial security, rendering this\nmethod unlikely to be feasible for all\nUniversities.\nSally Hunt, General Secretary of the\nUniversity and College Union, said\n\u2018\u2019we desperately need to overhaul how\nuniversities are funded and move away\nfrom the idea that the current review\nof student funding is merely a question\nof how much student fees go up by.\u2019\u2019\nArguably, the increase of tuition fees\nwill restore the view of elitism which\nwas once associated with universities\nand the students attending them.\nAaron Porter, the president-elect of\nthe NUS has opposed removal of the\ncap on fees and has said that this would\n\u2018\u2019expose students and their families to\nthe huge risks and potential calamities of the market, abandoning them to\nsink or swim\u2019\u2019. The Browne review will\nreport its findings in a few months.\nImperial College released a statement to felix on affirming their position of wanting to \u2018\u2019attract the best\nstudents regardless of background\nand means\u2019\u2019 to \u2018\u2019provide them with an\nacademic experience of the highest\ninternational quality.\u2019\u2019 They say \u2018\u2019the\ncurrent mechanism of funding plus\ntuition fee does not reflect the true\ncost of teaching science-based degrees\nto the high standard Imperial sets\u2019\u2019 and\nthat \u2018\u2019the College would wish to charge\nfees that reflect the quality of the education it provides\u2019\u2019. Commenting on\nthe situation, College said that it has\n\u2018\u2018not yet considered any particular\noption should the fee cap be lifted or\nremoved.\u2019\u2019\n\u201cThe taxpayer\ncontinues to\nfoot the majority\nof the costs of\nundergraduate\ndegrees and this is\nunfair.\u201d\n\n"

Nobody can decide\nwhat you would have wanted once\nyou\u2019re dead and gone, so you probably\nshould think about it before it gets to\nthat stage.\nNew York has been the most recent\narea of the world where the organ\ndonor system has been questioned.\nLast month, a New York assemblyman commenced his campaign for\n\u2018presumed consent\u2019 for organ donations after his daughter underwent a\nkidney transplant which saved her life.\nThe UK has the same system as the US\nwhen it comes to organ donation; we\nhave an opt-in system, which means\nthat you have to register to become\nan organ donor and (usually) carry a\ndonor card. The problem is that not\nenough people are \u2018opting-in\u2019 to the\nsystem, and it\u2019s not necessarily because they don\u2019t want anyone to have\ntheir organs once they\u2019re dead, it\u2019s just\nbecause they didn\u2019t know they had to.\nDespite the fact that around 90% of UK\nresidents claim that they agree with\nthe concept of organ donation, only\n27% of the population are currently on\nthe register. With over 10,000 people\nneeding an organ transplant, and ever-growing waiting lists, there just aren\u2019t\nenough hearts, kidneys, livers, corneas\netc. to go around.\nBack in 2007, Sir Liam Donaldson,\nthe UK\u2019s Chief Medical Officer recommended that we changed to a system\nof presumed consent here in the UK,\nso that we could increase the number\nof organs available for donation, and so\nreduce waiting times for transplant list,\nand ultimately save lives. As usual, the\ngovernment ignores the professionals.\nThe thing about donating organs\nafter death is, it doesn\u2019t even hurt. I\nwon\u2019t claim to be the most altruistic\nperson in the world. God knows nobody is taking my blood or bone marrow while I\u2019m alive, and the thought of\nhaving a blood sample taken makes me\ncome over all light-headed. But once\nyou\u2019ve departed for whichever afterlife\nyou fancy, you just don\u2019t need them\nany more. You might as well give them\nup to somebody who does.\nThis approach is not for everyone of\ncourse, to quote one of my friends \u201cI\u2019ve\nspent the last 21 years growing these\norgans to perfection, I\u2019m not giving\nthem to just anybody!!\u201d\nBut why not? Selfish git.\nCharlotteMorrisgivesherorganstoscience\n\u201c[In the UK] we\nhave an opt-in\nsystem, which\nmeans that you\nhave to register to\nbecome an organ\ndonor...\u201d\nF\nor a medic like myself, one of\nthe more hellish ordeals you\nmust face in your journey\nfor the elusive stethoscope of\npower \u2013 and an F1 post \u2013 is\npharmacology. So many drugs, so many\nside-effects, so many interactions, and\nthey keep making more all the time!\nTrying to learn it all is like Sisyphus on\nice-skates. But what really helps is finding patterns to link it all together.\nFor instance, Ibuprofen and Aspirin\nare both NSAIDs and they have N and\nI in them but Paracetamol doesn\u2019t, and\nit isn\u2019t an NSAID. But it does have a P...\nlike Penicillin, which is an antibiotic...\nbut it has an N and an I in it...loads ac-tually. Doesn\u2019t that make it an NSAID?\nAnd Prednisolone has an N, and I but\nthat\u2019s actually a steroid...and it has a P\nlike Paracetamol which cures infection\nor...was it...where was I?\nA lesson I learned in Monte Carlo was\nthat, no matter how good your system,\nthe house always wins. As true for diuretics and anti-emetics as it is for Texas\nHold\u2019em. Even with the most comprehensive and complex system ever de-vised, it is impossible to learn all the\ndrugs in the British National Formulary.\nInstead, what is needed is a good spring\nclean. There\u2019s a lot of clutter within the\npages of pharmacology textbooks and if\nwe could get rid of that, we might just\nbe able to get somewhere.\nTo that end, I have been beavering\naway at the bogged-down field of phar-macology, chipping away at everything\nless than absolutely vital. My efforts\nhave led to a revised pharmacology\ntextbook, much lighter on the mind, let\nalone the back. After some fine-tuning\nwith the dosages, it\u2019s finally ready for\npublication. Are you excited?\nFirstly a drug for everyone who is un-well. After some disastrous research trials at Northwick Park for that promised\npanacea, Paracetamoxyfrusebendroneomycin, I have devised an alternative\nwonderdrug. For all those under the\nweather and in need of a good pick-up,\nI prescribe Chicken Soup (400g, to be\ntaken orally, thrice daily at mealtimes).\nIts rejuvenative properties are well-doc-umented in the medical literature (well,\nsomeone\u2019s literature), proven to revive\nthe body and lift the soul. And at the\nvery least, it\u2019s not going to make things\nworse.\nSecondly, we need an analgesic,\nsomething to take away the pain. Like\nmorphine and heroin, it needs to be incredibly potent and also amazingly ad-dictive. This may sound like a bad idea\nbut with compliance rates notoriously\nbad in the NHS, I thought it would be\na nice change to have a drug people actually want to take. Thus, the analgesic\nto have to hand is Chocolate. I hardly\nneed to expound the wondrous efficacy\nof chocolate\u2019s pain-relieving properties\nbut the effects are two-fold. As well as\nsomatic pain, chocolate is an excellent\nremedy for emotional and psychological pain. It can be prescribed as an analgesic or an anti-depressent because\nof this, neatly taking out two birds with\none stone. Lollipops may also be prescribed for analgesia in children under\ntwelve.\nThirdly, we need a drug of last resort,\nthe one we turn to when all other avenues have failed. The current problem,\nespecially with antibiotics, is that the\ndrug of last resort ten years ago is now\nuseless due to rampant drug resist-ance. Therefore, we need something\nthat won\u2019t lose its edge, or if it does,\nwe can easily modify it for greater ef-fectiveness. And so we have the greatest weapon in our pharmacological arsenal \u2013 Cake. This is reserved for only\nthe most serious and severe of cases;\nterminal cancer, heart failure and athlete\u2019s foot. If faced with annoyingly\nrefractory disease, we can modulate\ntherapy with a range of icings, fillings\nand flavours. We also have the one with\nhundreds and thousands on it.\nIn addition to these, I heartily recommend hot blackcurrant squash for\nseasonal and pandemic flu, as well as\na nice cup of tea as prophylaxis for...\nanything.\nAnd there you have the crux of the\nnew pharmacology, simplified to op-timise patient care and, more impor-tantly, to preserve the sanity of future\nmedical students. Pharmacology will\nstill haunt the dreams of medics for\nyears to come but at least now, they\u2019ll\nbe dreaming of cake and chocolate, instead of Methotrexate and Infliximab. I\nwas worried that some may be tempted\nto self-medicate, especially during the\nstressful exam periods, but remembered that Imperial students are wiser\nthan that.\nThey\u2019ll just stick to alcohol, nicotine\nand caffeine as always.\nRhysDaviescan cure all ailments, no drugs\n\u201cMy efforts have\nled to a revised\npharmacology\ntextbook, much\nlighter on the mind,\nlet alone the back.\u201d\n\n"

IRG will be entering\nthe design segment of the competition\nwith their latest car, the IRG04. The\nIRG04 will succeed the IRG03 which\nentered the tournament last year, setting the standard high by bringing\nhome the award for Best/Most Innovative Design at the event.\nMany of the technical details of the\ncar are being kept under covers until\nthe competition day to prevent rival\nteams from undertaking excessive \u2018idea\ntransfers\u2019, but a few early CAD images\nhave been leaked recently showing an\nimpressive new chassis design. The car\nhas been developed with an emphasis\non efficiency, achieved through the implementation of technologies such as\nregenerative braking. This technology\nenables the energy usually lost during braking to be harnessed in super-capacitors which can then be used as\na power boost when overtaking; a feature not dissimilar to the KERS system\nused in F1 cars.\nIRG was started in 2006 being the\nfirst project of its kind at a British university to involve undergraduates in\nfuel cell research, and has since rapidly grown, now involving over 100\nstudents across all the engineering\ndepartments at the university. The students work on IRG projects as part of\ncoursework within their department in\nteams of around five, working on areas\nranging from suspension design to fuel\ncell cooling. IRG is also student run,\nwith a management team formed from\n3rd and 4th year students.\nAlready developing their fifth car,\nIRG have a wealth of experience under\ntheir belt and hope to further branch\nout into different industries to help\ncreate innovative solutions to battling\nclimate change. An example of this is\nthe current development of a fuel cell\npowered automotive vehicle to compete with the G-Wiz around the inner\nstreets of metropolitan London.\nIf you would like more information\non Racing Green or how you can be involved you can visit:\nwww.imperialracinggreen.co.uk\nWe know what you\u2019re thinking. We hope the car looks in better nick by the time that July comes around too\nW\ne had been waiting\nfor this game for\na long time. It had\nbeen rearranged 3\ntimes due to UCL\u2019s\ninability to field a side, we technically could have taken a walkover, but\nas they were the only other unbeaten\nteam in the league we wanted to beat\nthem fair and square. It was to be a day\nof mixed emotions for Sammy and Mel\nwho\u2019s last game in black and gold could\nsee the RSM ladies get promoted for\nthe first time since records began.\nThe big day did not start well; two\nof our players dropped out so we were\ndown to 10 men. A frantic two hours\nfollowed with many phone calls to our\nfriends at IC, but being the last week\nof term and very short notice, nobody\ncould step in. The next logical step was\nto look for sporty folk from within the\nRSM. After a call to the netball captain\nwe ended up with McNugget getting\nout of bed to join us.\nWe arrived on time to the pleasant\nsurprise of the opposition only have 10\nplayers! Our plan to go out hard and\nget early goals worked! The first ten\nminutes saw goals from Sanghee, Teddy and Laura - our force shocked them\nto the core and whilst we were basking\nin this unbelievable start the UCL girls\nwere starting to turn on each other and\nletting their anger show. The next 25\nminutes seemed to fly by and before we\nknew it half time arrived with a relaxed\nteam talk. The main message was keep\nup the good work, and that we did.\nUCL came back much stronger in the\nsecond half and although we scored again\nthey also snuck in an early goal. The pressure continued and the game was beginning to even out; they were a new team,\nbut still an angry bunch! They argued\nwitheachother,us,andeventheumpires.\nMore RSM goals followed as we\nrose above the torrent of abuse, or at\nleast some of us did\u2013not Angry Claire\nthough, who got involved in the fun\nand games! The Korean twins were\nalso seen to be muttering rapidly under\ntheir breaths but we can\u2019t understand\nthem at the best of times, and amidst\nthe flying sticks we had no chance.\nThe game ended 6-2 with our other\ngoals going to Laura, Teddy and Alex.\nSpecial mentions must go to: Matt\nand Paddy for umpiring; McNugget\nwho played a storming game and won\nImperial hurlers victorious\nFinian McCann Hurling\nL\nast Sunday, Imperial College\u2019s hurlers recorded their\nfirst victory since their inception last year. After plenty of drama in Beit Quad\ntrying to get our gear and with Chris\nFarrell arriving 45 minutes late with\nthe bus, we eventually made our way to\nSt. Kiernan\u2019s ground in Mill Hill to face\nCambridge University.\nTaking advantage of a break in the inclement weather, the match got underway an hour and a half late. The first\nfew cagey minutes of play saw neither\nteam score, until Cambridge broke\nthe deadlock. However, determined\nhalf-back sweeping by Neil Clancy\nand Mark Jennings and stalwart fullback Ciar\u00e1n McGreevy settled affairs\nin defence and soon the ball made its\nway forward to Se\u00e1n Dunne who elegantly slotted the sliothar over the bar\nto score Imperial\u2019s first point. Cambridge\u2019s midfield duo were moving well\nand had soon knocked over another\ntwo points and run in a goal past Farrell after some well put-together play.\nEventually a loose ball landed to midfielder Finian McCann whose skyward\nshot went straight over the Cambridge\nkeeper\u2019s head for a goal. Imperial continued to press, with Eddie Fitzpatrick\nand Padhraic Comerford working hard\nto move the ball into Dunne and John\nMcDonnell, whose pressure was rewarded with a goal for Dunne. Cambridge managed to sneak in another\ngoal and point before half time how-ever, Stevie Gallagher pulled one back\nfor IC, leaving the half-time score 10\npoints to 8.\nImperial took to the field in the second half determined to turn the game\naround. Cambridge were first off the\nmark again, converting a free from\nshort range. Imperial\u2019s fortunes soon\nchanged as a point attempt from Clancy fell short and went over the keeper\u2019s head for another goal. Cambridge\nswiftly worked their way back up the\npitch to get another point, but Imperial responded with McCann converting a free from fifty yards, leaving the\nteams level on 12 points each. Imperial\ncontinued to pile on the pressure and\nafter a goalmouth scramble in front of\nthe Cambridge net, the ball spilled out\nand McCann drilled it below the bar\nfor another goal, followed by Clancy\nadding a further point.\nImperial\u2019s dominant defence had\nblunted the Cambridge attack with\nEddie Fitz, pulling off some amazing\nreflex saves. Centre-back Neil Clancy\npushed forward again to calmly send\nthe ball over the bar from long range.\nMcCann converted another two points\nfollowing a thwarted Cambridge attack\nand after collecting a poor Cambridge\nclearence following intense pressure by\nChris Farrell and McDonnell. When a\nwayward shot from Sean Dunne was\ndeflected into the Cambridge net by\none of their defenders, it was clear that\nImperial were cruising to victory.\nOne final push from Cambridge\nsaw them convert a point, but Mike\nWhite, Clancy and McGreevy made\nsure it was their final score. McCann\nadded another point before McDonnell rounded off the scoring for the day\nwith a clever flick from close range past\nthe Cambridge keeper, leaving the final\nscore Imperial 25, Cambridge 13. The\nmatch was well-contested, neither side\nlet heads drop in spite of the scoreline,\nand it was a great achievement for the\nIC lads as many had only picked up a\nhurl for the first time last October.\nPromotion for the RSM ladies\nMan of the Match; Laura who scored\na cracking short corner to take Champagne Moment; and Bungey who sat\non the post all match and missed a\ngrand total of 7 open goals \u2013 obviously\nDick of the Day and proud wearer of\nthe luminous hoody.\nSo, the RSM ladies were promoted and\noff we went to the pub, the real celebrations were put on hold until the AGM!\nOlivia was elected next year\u2019s captain,\ntaking over from Kirsty. Good luck to\nher and the team in the new league.\nSaturday saw us once again conquer\nPresident\u2019s Day\u2013RSM mixed won all of\ntheir games, winning the overall trophy of the day and the inter college cup\nas RCS and C & G were pummelled\nthroughout the day. Congratulations\nto the Chaps who beat both the 22s\nand Links, making it the semis finals\nbefore RSM knocked them out.\nLook how happy they are! Especially the one on the left. Is that an octopus?\n\n"

The recently launched mascots, Orangey and Bluey,\nfor the 2012 Olympic Games were meant to be insiprations for children,\nbut instead turned out to be investigations for the police. It was at a\npromotional photoshoot at Rainbow Primary School in Hackney where\nthe scandal unravelled. A playground of silly poses and giggles soon\nbecame a scene of sickening screams and cries of terror as Orangey reportedly lunged out at an unsuspecting ethnic child with horrific sexual\nintentions. Luckily Bluey was quick to intervene and explained to his\npaedophile brother that molesting children is not very polite. Desginers\nof the mascots were deeply embarrassed by the situation, but insisted\nthey had not originally intended Orangey to be a paedophile. \u201cWe understand now that it probably wasn\u2019t such a good idea, but we thought it\nwould give the character some depth\u201d, said lead designer, Phillip Morris.\nMIRACLE\nMAN\nSURVIVES\nFALL FROM\nCHAIR\nTHE SHIPPING FORECAST\nTHIS WEEK:\n\u201cIS RAPE REALLY A CRIME?\u201d\nICRADIO.COM THURSDAYS 5-6PM\nSexyOsama69\nSTFU Osie, dis is my mohammad and I\u2019ll draw\nhim hows I want.

This is genuine post I found\nabout a couple who met on a date\nwebsite.\n\u201cTo the woman that crapped in\nmy car\u2026 (NE Portland). We met on\nCraigslist so I am hoping that this post\nfinds you. I know that it could quite possibly be the most humiliating first date\nthat you have ever been on, but I am\nwilling to look past that. I thought we\nhad chemistry sitting at McMenamins\nsharing that basket of Cajun Tots while\ndrinking the Terminator Stout.

The package I sent you with Pepto\nthe next day and the note that said\n\u2018First dates are always a crap shoot.\nCall me\u2019 was meant to be funny, not\noffensive.\nI have gambled on a fart and lost\non multiple occasions. The first time\nI did it was very memorable. It happened when I was five and sitting on\nmy uncle\u2019s lap. I am lactose intolerant,\nbut love cheese. I probably win 95% of\nthe time, but I don\u2019t think anyone wins\n100% of the time. That\u2019s why they call it\n\u2018gambling\u2019. I\u2019m the last person to judge\nyou for crapping your pants. In fact, I\nam impressed by your boldness. The\ntiming on the other hand, could have\nbeen a tad bit better\u2026 like when you\u2019re\nnot sitting on a heated leather seat\u2026\nWhat I am trying to say is that if you\nwant to go out again, I would be more\nthan happy to take you someplace\nwhere we can get a meal that is high\nin fibre and less taxing on the digestive\ntract.\nI await your call, Tad\nP.S. - If you shat yourself on purpose to\nend the evening early\u2026Touch\u00e9\u2026\n\u201d\n[Ed - Having lady problems, Charlie?\nA dating website?

Only thorough reviews\nof some of the highlights in literature,\nart, film and theatre to have come out\nof both the USSR, as was, and Russia\ntoday.\nShowing currently at the Haunch of\nVenison gallery in Mayfair is a survey\nshow of Non-Conformist art from the\n1980s which is of great interest to myself and anyone else who appreciates\ndissident art (think along the lines of\ngraffiti bandit Banksy). These artists\nwere frustrated with the strict and\nheavy proscriptions of Socialist Realism and so sought to mock it as a form\nof liberation. The central banner of\nthese two pages features a cutting from\na work by two such dissident artists:\nKomar and Melamid, whose work is\nclose to Socialist Realism in style and\ncontent, but certainly not in meaning.\nFurther criticism of the parent state\ncomes through in the charming comedy \u2018Irony of Fate\u2019 - a fairytale film aired\nin Russia every New Year\u2019s Eve.\nFinally, a more emotional account\nof the events of the 1917 revolutions\nis recreated in Bulgakov\u2019s The White\nGuard.\nWe hope you enjoy our special! \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430!\nSelf-confessed\nRussophile\nRosieMilton\nRosieMilton Arts Editor\nT\nhe revolutions in Russia\nof 1917 were meant to be\nunderstood as a \u2018George\nand the dragon\u2019 scenario:\nthe Bolsheviks charging\nin and saving the victimised proletariat\nfrom the clawed clutches of the bour-geoisie. Of course it was never that\nblack and white; not every member\nof the proletariat suffered. There were\nthe \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430\u043a (\u2018tight-fisted\u2019) \u2013 a group of\naffluent peasants, wealthy farmers, but\nwho were therefore somewhat unfairly\ngrouped alongside the bourgeoisie as\nclass enemies of the people, according to Marxism-Leninism. Due to the\nnature of the ideology constructed\nthroughout the Soviet period, the\nrevolution has always been portrayed\nas a successful, celebratory event (until\nmuch later in the 20th century). However, there were those of the bourgeoisie \u2013 including many of the intelligentsia \u2013 whose lives changed overnight\nand they themselves became victims\nof their circumstance. Mikhail Bulgakov who wrote The White Guard was of\nthe latter world and wanted to portray,\nwithout too much sensationalism, the\nsensitivity of a period where friends\nand family were dying by futile scuffles\nin the street and honour seemed to be\na lost cause.\nWhat struck me in Andrew Upton\u2019s interpretation of this play was\nhow well the actors played \u2018Russians\u2019:\nat times a little irrational, often fear-ful, but intensely passionate \u2013 beyond\nclass or rank. The main protagonists\nof the play are the well-to-do Turbins,\nliving in Kiev, the Ukraine. The brothers Alexei (Daniel Flynn) and Nikolai\nTurbin (Richard Henders) are officers\nof the White Guard and live with their\nsister Elena (Justine Mitchell) who,\nbeing the only female presence in the\nentire play, seems very lonely at times\nand has to contend with the pressures\nof the constant bantering and excitement of a group of young soldiers who\npass through her door each day \u2013 all\nof whom proclaim their love for her\nat some point during the proceedings!\nAs a character she remains strong and\nalso passionate, however, taking a lover\n\u2013 the very debonair Leonid Shervinsky\n(played by Conleth Hill) and eventually\nthrowing her cowardly husband (Kevin\nDoyle) out of her house.\nThe sets are absolutely realistic \u2013\nnear to cross-sections of actual rooms.\nThe main set is the living room of the\nTurbins, which is lit softly by lamps\nand houses a table around which much\nvodka drinking and harmonious song\nrises to lift everyone\u2019s spirits, including\nthe audience\u2019s. There are a few other\nsets that \u2018move\u2019 into position \u2013 the entire stage moved back at one point so\nthat another could take its place. The\naffluence of the National Theatre can\nbe experienced to a satisfying degree\nwith this particular production.\nReturning to the tone of the play, as\nyou can imagine it is one of sympa-thy, born out of the first-hand experiences of Bulgakov who is said to have\nbased the Turbin family of the play on\nhis own. Through the play, we realise\nnot only should we sympathise with\nthe soldiers of the White Guard, but\nfor the victims of the reds, as well as\nthose under the German occupation\nin Kiev and those at the hands of the\nindependent opportunists also. For\nthe people just trying to cope with living through each day, knowing where\nyour allegiance lay was not only vital\nto your survival, but also near impos-sible. At many points in the play we see\nconfusion or a changing of allegiance\nas quickly as is necessary. The soldiers\nbecome disillusioned as to who they\nare defending until they realise it is\nonly themselves they can protect.\nWhat is interesting about The White\nGuard is its history in the Soviet Union. The play was a favourite of Stalin\u2019s\nand ran for many years. This might\nseem a little unusual, considering how\nit portrays the two sides of red and\nwhite in a reversal of victimisation.\nHowever, if Stalin was to take some\npleasure in the story, it was probably\nin its domestic scenes: those tender\nmoments between friends and lovers \u2013\nthe White Guard literally showing its\npale, vulnerable underbelly. This twisted view in Stalin\u2019s mind appropriated\nthe strength and triumph of the red\nrevolution and after heavy censoring,\nthe play was allowed to run publicly as\na work of propaganda in the optimistic\noeuvre of Bolshevik art.\nThe protagonists of The White\nGuard are not completely without\nfault: there are those who express moments of violence and seek to blame\nanyone through their vodka-fuelled\nhaze of rage \u2013 even a hapless woman\nwho is just trying to hold her family\ntogether through this time of madness.\nIf I was in her place I would not know\nhow to find the strength \u2013 where would\nhope lie when your leader had been executed and there were enemies crowding in on every side, whose intentions\nyou did not understand? If you want to\nbe moved and amazed at how people\ncan manage to smile and share a joke\neven in the grimmest of times, this is\nthe play for you. It is both touching and\nfrustrating, but ultimately rewarding.\nFELIX ARTS SPECIAL:\nMikhail Bulgakov: friendship is stronger than politics\nRosie MiltonreviewsAndrewUpton\u2019ssublimereinterpretationofabigrevolutionarythinkerplay:TheWhiteGuard\nTHIS WEEK, ARTS EDITORS ROSIE MILTON & CAZ KNIGHT\nREPORT ON RUSSIAN CULTURE PAST AND PRESENT\nElena easily succumbs to the charms of her military man, Leonid Shervinsky The White Guard is showing at the NT\n\n"

On Wednesday Germany appeared to have taken one step further by banning short sales.\nT\nhe many students here\nconsidering future careers\nin finance have been given\ngood cause over the last\ncouple of years to worry\nabout the future of the European financial industry. Bold assertions have\nbeen made, ranging from the introduction of Tobin taxes on financial transactions to complete bans on certain in-struments. But for the most part, these\nhave turned out to have been populist\npoliticking as governments feared that\ndestroying the industry through undue\nregulation could jeopardise the huge\ntaxes extracted from them. For exam-ple, at their peak, taxes from the City\naccounted for fully one seventh of all\nBritish Government revenues. Last\nWednesday, Germany went against\nthis pattern of tough talk and relatively\nlittle action by announcing a ban on\nthe practice of short-selling on financial markets.\nShort-selling is the practice of making money from a fall in the price of\nunderlying assets such as stocks and\nbonds, in return for losing money if\ntheir prices rise. This negative exposure may be gained, for example, by\n\u2018renting\u2019 an asset, selling it immediate-ly, and then buying it back at the end\nof the rent period in order to return to\nthe original owner.\nThe announcement was made by\nChancellor Angela Merkel, in a speech\nto mark the opening of a parliamentary\ndebate on Germany\u2019s contribution to a\n\u00a3700 billion bailout aimed at stabilis-ing the value of the Euro. Merkel called\nfor faster cuts to German government\nspending, more international focus on\nfinancial regulation, and for insolvent\nEuropean states to be allowed to go\nbankrupt in future, rather than bailed\nout as with Greece. Merkel will be\nmaking the case for these measures\nto other European governments in a\nmeeting this Friday.\n\u201cThe lack of rules and limits can\nmake behaviour in financial markets\ndriven purely by the profit motive\ndestructive, and lead to an existential\nthreat to financial stability in Europe\nand even the world...the market alone\nwon\u2019t correct these mistakes,\u201d Merkel told German legislators, showing\nthat the German government has not\nwavered in its commitment to private\nmeans for public ends. \u201cAll of this will\nstay in effect until another solution has\nbeen found at the European level,\u201d she\ncontinued.\n\u201cMerkel called\nfor faster cuts to\nspending, more\ninternational focus\non regulation,\nand for insolvent\nEuropean states to\ngo bankrupt\u201c\nBut the biggest reactions were to the\nChancellor\u2019s promise to ban German\nfinancial firms from engaging in short-selling. All major European stock exchanges were down on Wednesday\non the news. The announcement was\nseen as a push back against recent\nelectoral difficulties for Merkel\u2019s coa-The European Central Bank has been concerned about the solvency of so-called\n\u2018PIIGS\u2019 - debt-ridden, over-spending Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain\nBefore the recent UK general elec-tions, the Liberal Democrats were\nmore vocal than the Conservatives\nabout the need to increase banking\nregulations. But both parties, who between them have formed the UK\u2019s new\ncoalition government, agree on a \u201cconsumer-protection\u201d agency, higher capital holding requirements, and tighter\noverall regulations, both domestically\nand internationally.\nBeforetherecentUKgeneralelections,\nthe Liberal Democrats were more vocal\nthan the Conservatives about the need\nto increase banking regulations. But\nboth parties, who between them have\nFrom left to right: French finance minister Christine Lagrarde, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President\nNicolas Sarkozy.

The\nLiberal Democrats meanwhile have gone\nsubstantially further and are calling for\nthe break-up of banks into retail-only\nand investment-only operations, even\nthe ones that are not owned by the Government that performed well during the\ncrisis.\nAs felix wrote for the election issue,\nsuch increases in the level of regulation are still unlikely to cause significant\nmovements of large financial firms to\nmore welcoming regulatory environ-ments. The latest move by Germany\nshould cause concern. Even worse is that\nthe British government talks as if it is\nbuying into a similar philosophy. But historically governments have never been\nas tough as their word on such a vital\nsource of taxes.\nThe actions of both the British and\nGerman governments currently suggest\nthat this is still the case.\nlition government, which has recently\nlost control of the Upper House of the\ncountry\u2019s parliament. Germany\u2019s recent pledge to bail out Greece, which\nis facing problems because its civil\nservants want raises that few German\nworkers have seen in the last two years,\nhas made matters considerably worse\nfor the Germany\u2019s ruling Christian\nDemocrat-Free Democrat coalition\ngovernment.\nThe reaction from across Europe\nhas been negative. Carsten Brzeski,\neconomist for the ING Group, the\nNetherland\u2019s biggest bank, argues that\nMerkel\u2019s move looks like \u201cpolitical desperation,\u201d sending \u201cthe totally wrong\nsignals to European partners and also\nto the markets...it\u2019s mainly driven by\nthe domestic political agenda.\u201d He\nworried that \u201cGermany is simply not\nable to come up with a clear line...

However, they generally recognised as degrees of national \u201cstrategic\nimportance.\u201d During the 2010 General Election,\nPrime Minister David Cameron deemed science\nand engineering \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to underpinning an economic recovery.\nThe Australian higher education model allows\nall home students to be \u2018Commonwealth supported\u2019. These students only pay part of the full\ncost of their degree, whilst the rest is publically\nfunded by the government. The balance between\nhow much the student is expected to pay and how\nmuch the government will fund is formulated\nby two factors: expected earn- ings following graduation, and national\npriority.\nA banding system of degree importance to the country as a whole is set out, with\nthe highest band of degree subjects receiving a greater proportion of public-funding. Students\nstudying Maths, Statistics and Science hence have a maximum of\nAUS$4,429 or \u00a32,670 per year for their\ncourse. In comparison, Law or Dentistry\nundergraduates pay a maximum of\nAUS$8,859 or \u00a35,340 a year.\nfelix overviews the challenges\nfacing students in higher\neducation as the Government\nlooks to shake up the British\nuniversity funding system\nThe Russell Group\nT\nhe Russell Group\u2019s submission to the Browne Review, which was released\nafter receiving pressure\nfrom the Aldwych Group,\nhas been met with anger regarding the\nproposed increase in tuition fees, following from the felix report last week.\nThey have labelled the suggestions\n\u201cregressive\u201d.\nThe Aldwych Group represent the\nstudent unions of Russell Group Universities, currently chaired by Emmanuel Akpan-Inwang, from LSE\u2019s Students\u2019 Union. The name derives from\nthe group having been established\nat a meeting in LSE, located on the\nAldwych.\nStudent leaders reacted angrily to\nsome of the suggestions put forward\nby the Russell Group, namely lowering\nthe threshold after which graduates\nbegin paying back their debts, currently \u00a315,000, and increasing the rate of\ninterest in loans in a bid to reduce the\ngrowing deficit in Higher Education.\nThe Russell Group of twenty research-based educational institutions including Imperial and Oxbridge warned of\ndebts upwards of \u00a31.1 billion by 2013,\nputting the sector \u2018\u2019severely at risk\u2019\u2019.\nIf subsidised student loans were to\nbe abolished, with interest rates going\nup, students will effectively be taking\nout loans with rates as high as those\noffered by banks today and won\u2019t be\nprotected from national interest rate\nchanges, potentially racking up huge\namounts of debt.\nThe Russell Group, however, advises\nthat this is a viable solution to encourage some up-front payments but to allow the government to support loans\nto cover significantly higher levels of\ntuition fees without increasing costs to\nthe Treasury.\nThe Russell Group submission mentions that \u201cAn increase in graduate\ncontributions is the fairest and only\nviable option for addressing the funding shortfall\u2019\u2019, setting out how tuition\nfees could rise to over \u00a39,000 per\nyear, a move which students have\ndescribed as a \u2018\u2019nightmare scenario\u2019\u2019.\nBoth the Aldwych Group and the\nNational Union of Students (NUS)\nhave slammed proposals to lift the\ncap on tuition fees, the latter forecasting \u2018\u2019mortgage-style debts\u2019\u2019 of\nmore than \u00a340,000 for graduates.\nThe submission, which is directed to the Browne review\non student finance, led by former chief executive of BP Lord\nBrowne, includes the Russell\nGroup\u2019s recognition that the cap on\nfees could not be removed imme-diately. Its director-general, Wendy\nPiatt, said that \u2018\u2019fees should increase\nincrementally\u2019\u2019 but would not give the\nvalue by which they would increase.\nThe submission states that \u2018\u2019graduates should be expected to contribute\nmore in view of the substantial private\nbenefits they secure through attending\nUniversity, particularly from certain\nprogrammes.\u2019\u2019\nScience, Technology and Medicine\ncourses (STEM) are considered \u2018\u2019strategically important\u2019\u2019, and it is proposed\nthat \u2018\u2019the level of public funding for a\nstudent should be a factor of the cost of\nproviding the course, the private return\nand public return, so that no student\nis deterred from taking courses like\nSTEM which are expensive to provide.\u2019\u2019\nThe proposal to increase the teaching\ngrant for STEM subjects is considered\nby Ashley Brown a \u2018\u2019sensible suggestion\u2019\u2019, since Imperial is unable to subsi-dise lab-based teaching with the profits\nfrom cheaper classroom based sub-jects. He mentions this is a suggestion\n\u2018\u2019which we have called for in the past\u2019\u2019.\nThe Russell Group proposed a means\nof differentiating costs similar to the\nAustralian higher education system.\nThey advised that high cost\nsubjects considered of strategic importance to the country should receive more in\nstate funds and cost students\nless, but did not specify an\namount. The Group justified\nthe increases by explaining that\n\u2018\u2019if graduates were asked to pay\nsteeper fees, they would value\ntheir degrees more highly and\nbe careful about and committed\nto the choices they made.\u2019\u2019 The\ngroup denied that the move would\ndeter students from poor and unprivileged backgrounds from applying to University.\nThe Group provided research figures\nto show that graduates earn the equivalent of about \u00a3160,000 more than non-graduates over their lifetimes, \u00a33,000\nmore per year with greater job satisfaction if they were from a Russell Group\nA collaboration between the UK\u2019s\n20 leading universities, including\nImperial. It is essentially the UK\u2019s\nanswer to the USA\u2019s Ivy League\nsystem. The 20 member universities\ngenerally receive about two-thirds of\ntotal government funding each\nyear. Together, the universities\nhave a strong influence on\nthe state of the UK\u2019s higher\neducation; it is well-reported\nthat they support lifting the\ncurrent \u00a33,255 cap on fees.\nT\nhere is change in the air. As the\ntalk of coalitions and minority\ngovernments are whisked away\nwith a passing breeze, students\nare starting to take a stand. Student activism has slowly faded since the noisy\ndays of the 1960s, but the imminent changes\nin higher education may rekindle the long-gone traditions.\nLast week saw students entering the Russell\nGroup\u2019s offices on Northumberland Avenue\ndemanding to see what changes to student finances their universities had proposed. This\ncame as The Russell Group were the last to\nsubmit their suggestions and perspectives on\nthe current and future state of British higher\neducation to a cross-party review set up by\nthe Government.\nThe first port of call was to allow all relevant parties, from higher education think-tanks to student unions, to lay down their\nown arguments for how the Government\nshould proceed.\nThe Russell Group will inevitably hold a\nmassive weighting in which way the Review\nswings.

Challenging its splendour was a strip of green situated on the\nmosque\u2019s very doorsteps, laden with complex if-not-reckless mosaics of shattered\nglass, its architects defiant drunks in their\nacts of sacrilege.\nThis was, by no means, a lifestyle equally shared among Casablancans.\nCome nightfall, and Abdellah and Suzanne retreated to their lounge for their\nnight-time entertainment. A hearty stew\nLuxury apartment\nblocks rose\nfrom the seaside\ndevelopment site\u2026\ndirectly opposite,\none of Casablanca\u2019s\nmost impverished\nslums\nwas prepared from meat bought from the\nlocal butcher, a traditional white-tiled af-fair, a visit for them a rarity reserved for\nspecial occasions and entertaining guests\ngiven their mediocre salary. As we lazed\non couches, the local football match was\nproduced by their television, which was\nthesizeofashoeboxandintermittedwith\nsignal disruption, and a spliff would be lit\nand paused around \u2013 smoking cannabis\nremains more socially acceptable than\nthe consumption of alcohol in Morocco,\nas well as being the more economical op-tion, despite its alleged illegal status.\nSoufiane\u2019s stereos were blabbing out\nhis House music, each a mix he had produced himself \u2013 he could afford the time\nand cost of musical equipment. Bottles\nof spirits littered across the table, swiftly\nemptied in preparation for an intoxicated\nnight out at a club. His friends gradually\nfiled into the apartment and, equipped\nwith a good degree of English, joined in\nthe banter.\nLater I would find out that, unani-mously, they have all received university\neducation in France or Spain. Soufiane\nhimself spoke Moroccan Arabic, French,\nSpanish and English fluently, as opposed\nto Suzanne having to act as interpreter\nfor Abdellah, who was unschooled in\nEnglish.\nWhen the booze supplies ran low we\nrelocated to the club Soufiane and his\nmates were habitu\u00e9s of. The entrance\nfee deprived us each of 200 dhs \u2013 the\nequivalent, I recalled, of Abdellah\u2019s and\nSuzanne\u2019s daily income. A last glance, albeit a drunken one, before entry exposed\nthe ranks of extravagant cars \u2013 not since\nentering Morocco have I seen exhibitions\nof vehicles that were not internally and\nexternally tattered.\nOnce inside, their garments, man-nerisms, attitude confirmed what I had\nanticipated of the club\u2019s patrons: this is\nwhere Casablanca\u2019s upper class come to\nplay. Not merely a playground of leisure,\nbut practice of liberalism, sexuality, unbound by social limitations and religious\nobligations.\nFor a society where drinking is frowned\nupon, intimate male-female interaction\nillicit, this venue \u2013 and no doubt similar\nvenues across the city \u2013 was riotous with\nrebellious spirits.\nBut surely, scrutinising especially with\na Western mindset, this was progress?\nBehind all the extravagance, all the\nknowledge, all the flashy rides, all the\nliberal lifestyle, only the rich may claim\npossession to so-called progress. This\nliberalism was to be purchased, most\noften only available to those who were\nfortunate enough to pop out of the right\nwombs.\nWhilst a minute proportion of Casablancans could afford to aspire to pay\nProletariats could\nonly aspire to\nsurvive another day\nin unemployment\nand poverty\nrises, designer-brand desirables, nocturnal outings of fervent alcoholism and\nerotica, a disproportionate mass of slum-dogs and proletariats could only aspire\nto survive another day in unemployment\nand poverty.\nSome, stricken by idleness and des-peration, resorted to extremism and the\npromises to wealth it asserts to provide.\nThe terrorist attacks in 2003, a series of\nexplosions in Casablanca that claimed\n45 lives, were conducted by bombers recruited from a slum on the city\u2019s\noutskirts.\nThe breakneck drive through neglected roads, sparsely illuminated by\nstreetlamps, offered little remedy to my\nalcohol-induced nausea. Soufiane\u2019s friend\nsped past yet another red light \u2013 his fifth,\nI counted. Though I do ponder now, in\nhindsight, what the purpose of his driving\nfast was. Was it recklessness? Was it bra-vado? Was it an eagerness to flaunt? Was\nit an act of imitation? Or, the presumption that discomforted me the most, was\nit a declaration of wealth and status?\nTori and I waited in the vehicle as\nSoufiane went to grab us a bite. Emerging from the shadows, the rugged man\napproached and pleaded for char-ity. Prompted, we bolted the doors and\nsealed the windows. The barrier stands,\nsolid as that we had barricaded ourselves\nbehind. The barrier which partitioned\nthe poor from ever grasping the riches\nCasablanca\u2019s high-risers and modern fa\u00e7ade represented.\nOr rather, while the champions of elitism karamu and fiesta behind closed\ndoors, have they segregated themselves\nfrom those authentically Casablancan?\nClockwise\nfrom top: Ave\ndes Forces\nArm\u00e9es Royales;\neveryday life\nat a seafood\nrestaurant, the\nOld Medina;\nan urban slum\nby the seafront\nof Casablanca;\nHassan II\nMosque, the\nthird-largest\nmosque in the\nworld\n\n"

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 21 MAY 2010\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nI\n\u2019d love to be able to have a free\neducation, a system truly based\non education for the most tal-ented, not the richest. The UK\nhas a history of cheap or free\neducation, but this led to an underfunded Higher Education sector, and\nscience and engineering departments\nacross the UK closing. Since 2006, UK\nUniversities have had access to funding\nfrom \u2018top-up\u2019 tuition fees. At Imperial,\nif you\u2019re a home student then you\u2019re\npaying the maximum of just over\n\u00a33,225 a year. With living expenses,\naccording to the registry, of \u00a310,000\na year, this leaves a student studying\na 4 year course with a debt of around\n\u00a350,000. Even though much of this\n(about 60-70%) is debt with the universally hated Student Loans Company, it\nstill leaves around \u00a315-\u00a320,000 to be\npaid for by term-time jobs, parents or\nmassive overdrafts and bank loans.\nUniversities like Imperial say that\ntuition fees introduced in 2006 have\n\u201chelped universities to put their re-search, learning and teaching provision on a more sustainable footing\u201d but\nhave students seen a real difference? I\nam happy to carry the burden of student debt if I see a good return. There\nwas definitely a power-shift for some\ninstitutions after 2006. More and more\nuniversities began reaching out to stu-dents, advertising places and trying to\nappear more open and enticing. The\nstudents are clients and the university\nis providing a service, something they\nbegan to acknowledge.\nClearly tuition fees aren\u2019t going away,\nbut the Russell Group (which Imperial is a part of) want them to go up\neven more. Possibly more intimidating\nthan that, they want graduates to start\npaying back their student loans faster,\nand at a higher rate of interest. Whilst\nthese changes won\u2019t affect you, I think\nthe prospect of even more debt after\ngraduation (up to \u00a310,000 in tuition\nfees per year) would definitely make\nyou think twice about how you could\never afford an Imperial degree. I believe there are many students who will\nbe priced out of the market \u2013 there\u2019s no\nguarantee you\u2019ll leave university with a\njob which can pay your various student\ndebts. But is it fair for anyone except\nthe graduate to pay for their education?\nProviding there is sufficient support\nfor those without funds, extending\ntop-up fees could be a workable sys-tem. However, if Imperial did receive\nthree times as much from students\neach year, we\u2019d expect that to be reflected in their teaching provisions.\nNo longer would we accept appalling\ncoursework feedback, a stuffy overheated library or such a weak student\nvoice in College\u2019s decisions.\nIt\u2019s up to the Browne Review and the\ngovernment to work out a way to effectively fund Higher Education, and\nensure access to education for all. A\nwide variety of evidence has been collected for the Browne Review and the\ngroup and they are now moving to\nthe stage where they select proposals\nand judge them based on their 3 key\ncriteria: \u201cguaranteeing the world-class\nquality of our Higher Education sys-tem; ensuring that talent, rather than\nability to pay, is what determines par-ticipation; and ensuring that funding\narrangements are sustainable for the\nlong-term.\u201d\nFree education is obviously the best\nmodel for ensuring that students are\neducated based on merit, but is also\nimpossible to implement economi-cally. If everyone was paying \u2018full\u2019 fees,\nlike international students, then we\nwould instantly price a vast proportion of the students out of a degree at\na Russell Group university. It\u2019s naive to\nblindly ignore the funding crisis, but at\nthe same time, Imperial and the government need to be realistic. A British\neducation should remain world-class\nand it must always be accessible to\nthose who want it.\nChrisDarbywantsworld-classeducation\n\u201cFree education is\nobviously the best\nmodel for ensuring\nthat students are\neducated based on\nmerit...\u201d\nH\numour, as those of you\nwith an interest in these\nthings will doubtless be\naware, is the quintessential quantum phe-nomenon. Those of you without an\ninterest in these things will probably\nhave stopped reading by the end of this\nsentence which, to be perfectly honest,\nis more your loss than mine.\nIn any case, now that I am left with\nonly the most discerning and attractive\ncross-section of my readership, we can\nreturn to the matter at hand. Which\nwas, in case your hand had gone to\nsleep, the fundamentally quantum\nnature of humour. The uncertainty\nprinciples which underlie the modern\nquantum theory dictate that in ordinary laboratory settings it is impossible to obtain an accurate reading of\nwhere a joke is going and simultaneously to know how amusing it will turn\nout to be.\nIn more technical terms, the uncertainty concerning a joke\u2019s final payoff,\nmultiplied by the uncertainty in its\nultimate destination, must always be\ngreater than a finite number known as\nPrank\u2019s constant. And it is this physical principle which makes the objective evaluation of humour so damnably\ndifficult.\nThe same phenomenon has also\nbeen observed in the non-scientific\ncommunity, where there is an old saying to the effect that explaining a joke\nis much like dissecting a frog. Nobody\nenjoys it very much and the frog is still\ndead. And this is why I would ordinarily have no interest in responding to\nthe Batrachian post-mortem that Tom\nHills conducted last week on a piece I\nhad written for election night.\nMy intention in writing on that fateful evening had been to amuse and en-tertain, and he, for whatever unfortunate congenital reason, assumed that I\nwas serious. Given how certain he was\nabout my intentions, the error bars on\nthe piece\u2019s humour were clearly going\nto be off the scale. What can you do.\nHad this incident taken place two\nyears ago, when I was still wet behind\nthe ears and damp beneath the arms, I\nwould have jumped at the chance for a\nwar of words with Tom. But this year\nI would gladly have let it slide, had it\nnot been for the fact that, owing to meticulous copy editing in my temporary\nabsence as deputy editor, his response\nappeared on two separate pages of last\nweek\u2019s paper.\nThe fact that my colleagues on the\neditorial team valued his criticisms so\nhighly has led me to re-evaluate the\nquality of my own work. If others can\ntake my writing so seriously, perhaps it\nis my own fault for not making the irony\nand lightness of touch sufficiently obvi-ous. Peeling back the skin of the original\namphibian, I can fully understand how\nthe suggestion that \u2018George Osborne be\ndipped in gold and sold as a commemorative figurine\u2019 would be taken as incitement to violence against one of the nation\u2019s most powerful figures.\nLikewise, my own unworthy self-mockery on the issue of my foreign\nbirth was clearly too near the knuck-le. When I apologised for having a\n\u2018tongue not yet suited to your mother\u2019,\nI could not have realised how profoundly offensive that remark would\nprove to be.\nPerhapsitwouldbebetteriftherewas\nsome form of linguistic tool specifically designed to distinguish an attempt at\nhumour from ordinary speech. Clearly\nsarcasm, the paradox, irony and metaphor no longer serve their purpose.\nFrom now on I propose that all jokes\nbe identified with the symbol (!). Not\nthat the above was a joke, of course, I\nwas merely road-testing the symbol (!).\nNo \u2013 that wasn\u2019t a joke either (!). But\nthat, on the other hand, being a third\nrepetition, can legitimately be considered funny and hence an appropriate\nuse of (!). Oh bother (!).\nI must of course, also apologise to\nTom and the legions of readers who I\nam sure also made eye contact with my\navatar two weeks ago, for my unfair use\nof long words and complex metaphors.\nSuch sesquipedalian tendencies and\nrhetorical excesses have no place in\nthe modern opinion piece, which must\nabove all things be bland, banal, bourgeois and, frankly, boring (!).\nBut, as was so rightly pointed out\nto me last week, it is only the most\nbigoted of individuals who criticise\nwithout offering a viable replacement.\nAnd yes, of course it is easy to knock\nthe response I received last week. It\nis the easiest, simplest, most patently\nobvious remark imaginable to say that\nthe piece was uninspiring and misdirected (!). But what would I have liked\nto see in its place? What alternative\nuse of those column inches would I\nhave preferred?\nI\u2019m sure I can leave that to your imagination (!).\nGileadAmit\u2019squantumtheoryofhumour\n\u201cOne cannot tell\nwhere a joke is\ngoing and at the\nsame time to know\nhow amusing it will\nturn out to be.\u201d\n\n"

But alas\nthis is the strange fortitude that now de-masks itself in front\nof the world; Britain\u2019s first coalition\ngovernment since the Second World\nWar, and boy are we in for a ride.\nLabour introduced 111 tax rises\nsince 1997, took a trillion pounds in\nadditional taxation, and still left us\nwith a Greek-level deficit: 12.6 per\ncent of GDP and rising. Of every four\npounds Gordon Brown spent, one was\nborrowed. The national debt is rising\nby nearly \u00a36,000 a second.\nClearly this is the time to be talking\nabout electoral reform then.\nMost of you will already be familiar with the strange constitutional\nspectacle that took place on Wednesday the 12th of May 2010. Mr. Brown\nresigned as PM, Mr. David Cameron\nbecame the new PM and Nick Clegg,\nthe leader of the Liberal Democrats,\nwas running around like a headless\nchicken trying to figure from which\nmain party he could get the best\nelectoral reform deal. Never mind\nthe economic crisis facing the coun-try, electoral reform must come first\nif you are a Liberal Democrat. In the\nDutch Auctions of the past a few days,\nchange in the voting system has been\ncaricatured as a deal breaker.\nBy muddling the genuine arguments that can be made for reform,\nwith cynical attempts to cobble together the self-serving electoral arrangements necessary to sustain the\nhegemony of particular politicians,\nthere is a grave danger that the case\nfor reform will be lost. A coalition\nwas formed with no mandate whatsoever for far-ranging constitutional\nreform. But as events transpired: Mr.\nClegg wanted PR but was given AV\nbut under the FPTP system he got\nroyally buggered. What on earth does\nthat latter sentence mean you are\nprobably thinking? Good thing you\nFollowing the talk of changing the way we vote, Neil Dhir dissects the different systems used around the world\nHow many MPs would there be for each party if the system changes?\npicked up felix, for you are about to\nfind out.\nWhenever there is an election and\na political party loses they blame the\nsystem. You will be familiar with this\nprocedure as it is a juxtaposition of\nwhen your exam results arrive. This\ntime the Liberal Democrats were\nborder-lining on obsession when it\ncame to the electoral system. With\nhindsight, one does understand Mr.\nClegg\u2019s grievances. Not only did he\nget nearly every single student vote\nin the country he was also at the centre of \u201cCleggmania\u201d. What happened?\nWell, he actually lost seats compared\nto the last general election in 2005.\nMr. Clegg\u2019s solution to this little hiccup is to change the voting system to\nsomething known as \u2018PR\u2019 or Proportional Representation.\nNo electoral system is perfect.\nSome, however, are more perfect\nthan others, and some are utter shite.\nUnder the Proportional Representation system or \u2018PR\u2019, several members\nof parliament would be elected per\nconstituency. Every political party\npresents a list of candidates and voters can select a list, that is they vote\nfor a political party. Parties are assigned parliamentary seats proportionally to the number of votes they\nget. There are several pros and cons of\nthis system and at first sight it would\nseem that it is the most democratic.\nEvery interest group would be represented in parliament, if that system\nhad been used on Friday, the BNP\nwould have 12 MPs today. There is\nalso more choice for voters since, as\nsaid; every interest can be represented if enough people vote for it.\nThe current system is unrepresentative \u2013 it gives all the power to\none party, however small its majority\nmight be. For instance, only a quarter\nof those eligible voted for Labour at\nthe last general election.\nAs it is, many MPs are elected to\nParliament despite 75 per cent of\ntheir constituency voting against\nthem. Often solid, centrist policies\nwill result and that is fine if you belong to continental Europe which\nhas such traditions, as PR seldom results in one party holding an absolute\nmajority, it requires governments to\ncompromise and build consensus according to FairVote.org. PR can create stable government, but not necessarily strong government. Of grave\nimportance is that any significant\nchange to the electoral procedure\nwould require a national referendum,\nparticularly since the constitution of\nthe United Kingdom is uncodified.\nThe coalition governments that PR\ntends to produce are often weak and\nindecisive. Italy, which has such a\nsystem, has had to dissolve its parliament seven times in the last 40 years\nand has had 60 different governments\nin the same time (and counting).\nWhen List PR is used, and particularly when seats are allocated in one\nsingle national district, as in Namibia\nor Israel, the system is criticized for\ndestroying the link between voters\nand their representatives.\nWhere lists are closed, voters have\nno opportunity to determine the\nidentity of the persons who will represent them and no identifiable representative for their town, district or\nvillage, nor can they easily reject an\nindividual representative if they feel\nthat he or she has performed poorly\nin office, or is not the kind of person\nthey would want representing them.\nThe system also encourages excessive entrenchment of power within\nparty headquarters and in the hands\nof senior party leaderships. A candidate\u2019s position on the party list,\nand therefore his or her likelihood\nof success, is dependent on currying\nfavour with party bosses, while their\nrelationship with the electorate is\nof secondary importance.

Facebook\u2019s\nprivacy policy is currently longer than\nthe United States constitution, and has\ngrown a massive 480% in the last five\nyears. Making sense of the tangle of\noptions and jargon is practically im-possible, and unfortunately it seems\nlike Facebook might be banking on this\nto sell your information for a profit. app I use on Facebook? Not so much.\nIt\u2019s a problem that Facebook has had to\ngrapple with continuously as they have\ntried to monetise their service; trying\nto find the line, which crossed, leads to\nusers no longer feeling comfortable using the site.\nfind their Facebook page. Facebook\npages were internal to those on Facebook. Three years on and the list of\ninformation from Facebook accessible\nto the wider internet is surprising: your\nname, photo, picture, gender, network\ninformation (and possibly even your\nwall posts) are available by default.\nThese changes to the service would\nbe fine if Facebook clearly notified\ntheir users each time a change was\nmade, or making the changes opt-in.\nProblem is time and time again they\nhaven\u2019t, simply moving all users to\nthe new, more open privacy settings\nby default. It\u2019s a stalker\u2019s paradise but\na job seeker\u2019s nightmare. Even if you\nmaintain a strict handle on your own\nsettings, your privacy is also in the\nhands of people whom you are in photos with, and whose walls your write\non. Safely maintaining that extended\npresence on the internet is practically\nimpossible.\nI\nn a week of privacy being in the\ntechnology press spotlight, we\u2019ve\nhad several offenders. Facebook\nof course has taken centre-stage,\nbut let\u2019s not forget about Google. Facebook might own your \u2018private information\u2019, but Google owns almost all of\nthat and more. The difference is that\nGoogle owns up when it\u2019s done something shady, like this week with the\nrevelation that its StreetView cars have\nbeen collecting terabytes of data from\nunsecured wifi routers on their travels.\nApparently due to a programming er-ror, the data collected has been deleted\nand Google said \u2018sorry\u2019\n. As connected as\nwe are, it\u2019s easy not to share too much,\nbut don\u2019t be one of those people to get\ncaught out. Think before you post it.\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nB\nam, another week is\ndone! Yeah, they\u2019re\nflying by now, and the\nnews is pretty thick\nand fast, so here\u2019s a quick rundown to keep you up-to-date.\nIn a week filled with Facebook bashing, the company\nre-launched its stripped out\n\u2018lite\u2019 version, Facebook Zero.\nThis time however it\u2019s aimed at\nthe \u2018emerging markets\u2019, which\napparently will include the\nUK, and can be accessed free\nof charge due to partnerships\nwith quite a few network carriers in countries like Indonesia\nand Bolivia that are already in\nplace. The text only site is aiming to be the free sample that\nhooks you into the crack that is\nthe Facebook ecosystem.\nEverybody\u2019s favourite (or\nloathed) London Mayor, Boris\nJohnson, hit the tech news this\nweek with an announcement\nthat he wants London to be the\nworld\u2019s biggest WiFi hotspot.\nBoJo plans to use lampposts\nand bus stops to blanket the\ncity in WiFi, all in readiness\nfor the 2012 Olympics. Many\nUS cities have tried and failed\nto do the same, but fingers\ncrossed Mayor Blondie can get\nit done.\nEven if WiFi can\u2019t get the job\ndone, we might have ubiquitous local networking thanks\nto LEDs and some Chinese\nboffins. Of course things have\nmoved on a bit since the days\nof IrDA (remember those\ndays Grandpa?), with 2Mbps\ndemonstrated using ceiling-mounted blue LEDs that serve\nas lighting at the same time.\nWe\u2019re not talking Gigabit\nspeeds here, but it would be\na great way to serve all those\nconnected appliances we\u2019ve\nbeen promised, Internet fridg-es, toasters, microwaves and\nplant pots, all that \u2018future\u2019 tech.\nSpotify has been busy this\nweek too, introducing new\nprice plans in an attempt to\nmove its streaming service to\na more viable business model.\nBy introducing a new free plan\ncalled Spotify Open, new users\ncan get 20 hours of streaming\nmusic a month supported by\nadverts. If that\u2019s not enough,\nyou now have Spotify Unlimited which is \u00a34.99 a month,\nproviding unlimited ad-free\nstreaming to your computer\nonly. If you want to go mo-bile, then you\u2019re going to have\nto fork over \u00a39.99 a month for\nSpotify Premium. Current ad-supported users won\u2019t be affected by these changes, so fear\nnot all you stingy-streamers.\nLast but not least, DuPont\nthe company best known for\nLycra among other things,\nwants to print up a 50\u201d OLED\ndisplay for you in just two min-utes. Using its latest tech, DuPont reckons it can compete\non cost with LCDs and deliver\n15-year lifespans in the near\nfuture. 50\u201d OLED? I\u2019ll take one.\nSamuel\nSamuel\nGibbs\nGibbs\nTechnology\nEditor\nPrivacy.\nWhat\u2019s Privacy?\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s development of\nthe website. Before Zuckerberg even\ncoded Facebook, he worked on a small\nproject called Facemash, which allowed users of the website to rank students from Harvard by attractiveness.\nThe only problem was Zuckerberg\nneeded users on his website, and to get\nthose users he hacked into Harvard\u2019s\nstudent database, downloading the required information to kick the website\noff. He then joined a team of students\nworking on a social networking project\ncalled \u201cConnectU\u201d, and then bailed to\nstart Facebook using their ideas. Facebook paid $65m to the other members\nof the team after a lawsuit, an amount\nsizeable enough to suggest that there\nwas some truth in the allegations that\nZuckerberg stole ConnectU\u2019s ideas.\nAnd finally, a chat transcript from early\nin Facebook\u2019s days catches Zuckerberg\ncalling users \u201cdumb f***s\u201d for uploading all their personal information onto\nhis website. A healthy attitude for a\nman now in charge of 400 million user\naccounts.\nYet the one thing that has kept people\non Facebook has been inertia. Once\nyou have built up a friends list containing a network of hundreds of friends\nand family, no one is going to want to\nswitch networks and rebuild that. Even\nmore valuable are the pictures, videos and other content you might have\nsaved on the website, a fact Zuckerberg\nis keenly aware of.\nChanges to Facebook have been\nruthlessly bold, with features being\nintroduced without any beta testing\nand seemingly without regard to user\nresponse. The same goes for the privacy policy; no one really cares until\nsomething bad happens to them, and\nby then it\u2019s too late.\nEven May 31st being launched as\n\u201cQuit Facebook Day\u201d hasn\u2019t raised\nanywhere near the amount of attention\nrequired to even make a statement to\nFacebook.\nIf Zuckerberg is banking on apathy, it\nlooks like a safe bet.\nWhen Facebook was in its infancy, a\nsocial network run only for college students at Harvard, the cost of maintaining a largely text and photograph based\nservice would have been relatively low.\nAt its current state as the primary social network for roughly 400 million\npeople across the globe, serving huge\namounts of video, flash-based games\nlike Farmville and high resolution im-ages, the cost of maintaining the site\nmust be enormous, and that gives rise\nto the question of monetisation.\nWebsites like Google have an easy\nand obvious source of revenue with\nadvertising based on searches. Facebook also looked to use revenue from\nsearches, and they had a trump card,\nvast amounts of your personal infor-mation. Yet the problem with sharing\npersonal data with third parties has\nalways been, how much is too much.\nWhile I\u2019m fine with Google picking\nkeywords out of my emails to give me\ntargeted adverts, would I be fine with\nmy pictures being used to advertise an\nFacebook\u2019s attitude towards finding\nthis proverbial line has made the problem many times worse than it should\nbe. Over half a year ago, Facebook\nmade a change to its Terms of Service\nwithout making it clear to users. One\nof the new paragraphs added stated,\nin short, \u201cyour stuff is our stuff\u201d. Everything you published on the service\nwas owned by Facebook, indefinitely.\nAfter an initial uproar, this was quickly\nwithdrawn, but it typifies their angle\ntowards privacy issues: change the\nrules first, then wait and see if anyone\nnotices. A few months back, Facebook made another new, more subtle\nchange: allowing an increasing amount\nof information to be indexed by search\nengines. Three years ago, it wasn\u2019t possible to Google someone\u2019s name and\nThe concerns about Facebook\u2019s attitude towards privacy are heightened\nby the apparent nature of founder\nNYTs infographic showing the maze of Facebook\u2019s privacy options\nThen why not check out the\nlatest episode of the Wrap\nSheet podcast talking internet\nprivacy, the Dell Streak on O2\nand hands on with the Nokia\nN8.\nAvailable\nfree on\niTunes,\nFacebook\nor the blog\nwww.thewrapsheet.co.uk\nNot enough?\nMonetisation\nMonetisation\nAttitudes towards Privacy\nAttitudes towards Privacy\nQuestions about Zuckerberg\nQuestions about Zuckerberg\nCan anyone be bothered?\nCan anyone be bothered?\n\n"

As soon as\nthe rehearsal was over, fourteen of the\nmost intrepid members of the String\nEnsemble started frantically packing a\nminibus and John Sandall\u2019s car with in-struments, music stands and luggage.\nIn the capable hands of our driver (and\nalso the leader of the ensemble) Jon\nSilver, we reached the YHA hostel in\nCanterbury at about 11.30. We whiled\naway the rest of the evening with a quiet game of Cranium, which had many\namusing moments, as well as several\nquite disturbing ones.\nBreakfast was at 8.00 in the morning,\nand we saw various different interpretations of that particular instruction\nas ICSE members wandered into the\ndining room anytime up to two minutes before we had to leave. The \u201cearly\u201d\nstart was a sign of things to come, as it\nwould be a pretty intense weekend. We\nimmediately jumped back on the minibus and set off towards our concert\nvenue - Abbeyfield Connors House\nresidential home, where we were welcomed by the manager of the tour,\nNicola Jee, and a fat, dozy rabbit.\nWe quickly settled into our rehearsal\nroom, and began the first of three intense rehearsals. Our repertoire was\nthe music we were planning to perform that term: Mendelssohn\u2019s String\nSymphony no. 8, Stravinsky\u2019s extremely challenging Concerto in D, Barber\u2019s\npowerful Adagio for Strings and Stop\nPlaying Homework and do your Video\nGames by some guy on the internet.\nThis was our first look at the video\ngames piece, which was a collection\nof classic (and mostly Nintendo) video\ngames ranging from Tetris to Zelda,\narranged for strings. It was a pleasant change from the more conventional repertoire, and for those of us\nwho know and love those games, was\na great blast from the past. Although\nhaving only been with the ensemble for\na term and a half, our new conductor\nScott Wilson already knew how to get\nthe most out of the group, and it was a\nproductive, if slightly sleepy, rehearsal.\nNaturally there were tea breaks to keep\nus all happy.\nJustafterlunchwehadourfirstchance\nto explore the city properly. We were a\nshort walk from the cathedral, which\nis where the more cultured among us\nmade our way to. Armed with a guide\nof the cathedral, we made a vague attempt to follow the route marked on the\nplan, but sadly were unable to explore\nthe whole place when several areas\nwere suddenly and inexplicably roped\noff. What we did manage to see ranged\nfrom the spectacularly massive stained\nglass windows to the huge collection\nof crucifixes and chalices, which were\nboth breathtaking and at the same time\nrather eerie. To complete our afternoon\nof culture, we headed off in the general\ndirection of the castle, under the guidance of Ingolf\u2019s map reading skills. As\nfar as I gather, the rest of the ensemble\nspent their free time in a teashop, leisurely making their way through tea\nand cakes.\nEventually it was time to make our\nway back to the residential home to\nresume our rehearsal. On the way back\nSam took about two hundred pictures\nof a river, and a few of a bus narrowly\nmaking it through the city wall gate.\nFocusing on the Stravinsky \u2013 easily\nthe hardest of the pieces \u2013 made it a\ntough rehearsal, but ICSE people are\nmade of stern stuff, and we made great\nprogress that afternoon. When we got\nback to the hostel, many of us were seriously ready for some food\u2026 and soon\nwe had it: massive amounts of pasta,\ncooked by Toby and the ladies of the\nICSE committee. There was enough\nfor at least five helpings each.\nThe next important thing was to\nfind a suitable establishment to spend\nthe evening at. After spending quite\nsome time wandering around looking\nfor the best pub in Canterbury, we finally settled down to sampling some\nof the more interesting looking local\nales, and generally recovering from\nwhat had been a long and strenuous\nday. The traditional sectional shots\nwere held at various stages throughout\nthe evening, starting with the classic\n\u201ccello shots\u201d, and later on moving on to\nsome of John\u2019s more dubious drinking\nideas. All too soon it was time to leave,\nbut a couple of cellists managed to get\nthemselves locked inside the pub, due\nto being in the toilets while it was clos-ing. We stumbled our way back to the\nhostel, some of us looking forward to\nthe morning less than others.\nSure enough, breakfast was an interesting time for some members of the\nensemble, although everyone was fully\nrecovered in time for the early morning rehearsal, where finishing touches\nwere put to the pieces, to prepare for\nthe concert that would follow in the\nafternoon. As soon as it was over, we\nimmediately moved off to another\npub, this time for lunch. The return\nto the residential home was quite a\nrush, since we had waited a while for\nfood at the pub, but we quickly set up\nstands in another one of the rooms,\nand changed into our typically sombre\nconcert dress.\nThe concert was casual, but well-received, although I\u2019m not sure if many\nof the elderly residents fully appreciated the video games piece. We played\none movement of the Stravinsky, the\nvideo games piece, and two movements of the Mendelssohn, which went\ndown very well. It was a solid perfor-mance, and it was particularly satisfying to see the results of the intensive\nrehearsals paying off so soon. As soon\nas it was over, we packed everything\ninto the minibus again, and set off towards London.\nThis was our first of what will hopefully be many tours with our new con-ductor, and everyone involved had a\ngreat time. After the success of our last\nfew tours in the UK, we hope to expand\nour horizons by touring on the continent this summer.\nIf you\u2019d like to take a bit of time out\nto listen to some light music, come\nand see our Summer Concert in Holy\nTrinity Church (next to the Union) on\nFriday 18th June \u2013 we\u2019ll be playing music by Purcell, Parry, Mozart and Bach\nand following it up with a barn dance\nto end the evening in style. Hope to see\nyou there!\nFinance Society take it to the next level in the Big Apple\nI\nn keeping with ICFS\u2019s efforts\nto continually broaden and improve its events, the society took\na great leap from the usual format of a talk in SAF followed by\nfree condiments, to a 5 day trip to see\none of the world\u2019s largest financial cen-tres. Highlights included tours of J.P.\nMorgan and Bloomberg headquarters,\ntickets to an NBA game, a tour of Wall\nStreet as well as a free licence to roam\nand discover the numerous attractions\nNew York has to offer.\nFurthermore, to gather a true insight\ninto the strenuous life style of your average banker, a \u201cstrictly educational\u201d\nnight was spent living the highlife in\none of the Marriot\u2019s penthouse suits,\noverlooking the Manhattan skyline. I\ncould go on and on but I don\u2019t think\nI could sum up the trip nearly as well\nas some of the finance societies members fortunate enough to go; Henry\nMcGowan \u201cwas so sad to leave I\ncouldn\u2019t help myself from crying on the\nflight home\u201d. Vedish Bhatoolaul \u201cexperienced the proverbial \u2018craning of the\nneck\u2019 to capture the tips of skyscrapers\nand the sense of wonder and humility\nwhile standing at their feet\u201d. And finally\nthe society\u2019s President Bradley Jones\nsurmised the experience: \u201cthis trip was\na real reminder that we are improving and expanding every year \u2013 I can\u2019t\nthink of a better way to have celebrated\na year of such hard work by each and\neveryone in the ICFS team. I look forward to the year ahead!\u201d\n\u2018The Video Games\npiece ... a collection of classic video\ngames ranging from\nTetris to Zelda, arranged for strings.\u2019\nIC Finance in New York, where they toured Wall Street and hopefully learnt how not to do finance\n\n"

After a long walk from the\nstation, the Surrey home ground was\nreached. Winning the toss, Imperial\nchose to bat first on a slow wicket.\nAnirudh Sompalli held on to his first\nover curse when, after smacking the\nfirst ball for four, he sent the second\nball straight back to the bowler who\nheld onto a sharp catch to provide the\nfirst blow.\nIn came Majid Ali with all guns blaz-ing, playing brilliant drives and generally taking the game to Surrey despite\nlosing Matt Tarr soon after. Skipper\nAnkit Patel came in, looking to play a\ntextbook captain\u2019s innings and see the\nteam through to the end. After a good\npartnership with the skipper, Ali fell\ntrying to clear the boundary at long\non, and an extra couple of wickets fell\nin a hurry. Ahsaan Ismail and Patel recovered their balance and had a good\npartnership as they held off an ener-gised Surrey team. Eventually, both fell\ntrying to up the run rate after playing\nthemselves in, Ankit top-scoring with\n43.\nFrom there the team tried to make\nmost of the last 10 overs but kept losing wickets regularly as they ended\nup setting a target of 142 at the end of\ntheir innings.\nEven though they didn\u2019t have a vast\ntotal to defend, the Imperial bowlers\ncame in with good confidence since\nthey had seen from their own innings\nthat scoring runs on this slow wicket\nwas not easy. Navin Surtani and Singh\nstarted their spells well and both got\na wicket as IC put the Surrey team\nunder pressure. Later on, both Ismail\nand Sompalli bowled top spells, also\ngaining a wicket apiece as the Surrey\nteam was reduced to four down. Unfortunately, the quick bowlers somewhat struggled to find rhythm on a\nslow wicket where, bizarrely, they had\nto lower their pace to get the most out\nof the pitch. The Surrey batsmen were\naccustomed to batting on their home\nground and were able to chase down\nthe rest of the runs without losing any\nmore wickets.\nAfter winning three games in a row,\nthe Firsts have now lost the last two\ngames of the BUCS tournament and\npromotion seems unlikely. However,\nthey still have the ULU league to look\nforward to, starting this week.\n****\nAfter a long but generally uneventful\njourney to Harlington, IC set about a\nquick warm-up and survey of the skies\nwhich gave uncertain results as to the\npossibility of a complete game. Nonethe-less, Imperial decided to bat first\non a bouncy but green track.\nOpeners Ben Bell and Rohan Babla\ngot Imperial off to a flyer, taking three\nfours off the first eight balls. However,\nthis was a false sense of security: Babla\nand Bell were bowled in consecutive\novers by well-disguised yorkers before\nAnirudh Sompalli edged behind for a\ngolden duck. Once again, it was left\nto Andy Payne to steady the ship (and\ndeal with some terrible sledging) with\nVinno Balakumarasingham also falling\ncheaply. With some typically crunching blows and ill-advised heaves, good\npartnerships with Bernard Pereira\nand Adam Hugill were formed before\nPayne lost concentration and ran himself out for 45, attempting a second run\nthat simply wasn\u2019t there. Hugill (34)\nand Ahsaan Ismail (30) continued to\nattack the Holloway bowlers with well-placed pulls and drives before both\nfalling in short succession as IC were\nall out for 191.\nPatchy bits of rain had punctuated\nImperial\u2019s innings, but Royal Holloway\nbegan their reply with everyone in high\nhopes of getting in (at least) the necessary 20 overs to constitute a result.\nIsmail had the right-handed opener in\nserious trouble right from the first ball\nbefore Payne did everything but find\nthe outside edge of the left-hander.\nThe cat and mouse games continued\nfor the first 10 overs, with the batsmen\nscoring well, until Payne managed to\ninduce an edge to the keeper from a\nwell-directed bouncer.\nUnfortunately, after a couple of\nthreatening overs from captain Pete\nSwallow, the rain started to get heavier\nand the umpires called the players off.\nHalf an hour later it was still raining,\nand both teams had to admit defeat to\nthe weather with the game an agonising six overs from completion.\nA dedicated performance from Imperial bodes well for the remaining\nULU games, and they have a good\nchance of a high finish if the weather\nstays fair.\n\n"

Each volleyball team has six players with the teams\nseparated by a net, one team begins the\nrally by serving to the opposing team,\npoints are scored by grounding the ball\non the opponent\u2019s side of the net within\nthe court area. The team that wins the\npoint then serves for the next point. A\nset is won when one team is the first\nto reach 25 points (by two clear points)\nmatches are played on a best of 5 set\nbasis, with the fifth set if necessary being played to 15 points.\nThe men\u2019s volleyball team won all\nten of their matches played during\nthis season. felixSport caught up with\nthe captain of this year\u2019s successful\nVolleyball team, Marc to discuss the\nachievements of this season. \u201cThe first\nteam squad this year was made up of\n12 players; Edoardo Barengo, Marios\nChartosias, Domenico Corapi, Christoph Datler, Gonzalo De Gisbert, Benoit Disch, Harry Fredheim, Alessandro Galli, Ergument Karako\u00e7, Nikolaos\nNikolaou, Platon Vogiatzoglou and\nmyself. Harry Fredheim, Allessandro\nGalli, Nikolaos Nikolaou were new\nadditions to the squad this year and\nplayed key roles in our BUCS success.\u201d\nDespite performing so well during\nthe course of the season it was not\nplain sailing for the Imperial Volleyball team which was certainly apparent\nwhen Oxford University travelled to\nplay them in a championship qualification match: \u201cWe had expected to beat\nthe Oxford team as we had a stronger\nsquad, all of whom were at our dis-posal. When Oxford arrived however, I\nhad forgotten to organise independent\nreferees to officiate the match as is required in our conference. I was able to\norganise referees at short notice with\nthe game set to start an hour later than\nplanned. We offered the Oxford teams\nseveral options prior to this in an attempt to let the match proceed. Our\nefforts were in vain as the Oxford team\nleft Ethos 45 minutes after the scheduled start claiming the default win.\u201d\nSuch actions by the Oxford team not\nfelixSport talks to the table topping Volleyball team\nFollowing last week\u2019s interview with Women\u2019s Fencing, we catch up with Marc Sch\u00e4pert\u00f6ns, Volleyball Captain\nonly appeared to be unsportsmanlike\nbut when they reached the finals in\nSheffield they succumbed to university second string teams and ranked\na dismal 7th out of 8, losing all three\nof their group stage matches with the\nMarc confident that the Imperial team\nwould have fared much better in the\nFinals.\nTheir final game of the season was\nplayed this week against the Flaming\nSix Aces. The season finale was victo-rious, ending with a 3 - 1 win.\nThe second set was closely contested\nending 32:30 in Imperial\u2019s favour, but\nadmitted the following set did not go\naccording to plan.\nName: Marc Sch\u00e4pert\u00f6ns.\nAge: 20.\nSubject: Second Year Chemical\nEngineering.\nHeight: 1.85m\nLength of Time Playing: 10 years.\nMeet the Captain:\nMen\u2019s Volleyball 1sts\nI\nn keeping with the traditions\nof the GAA and Ireland, this\nreport is a bit late! On a dreary\nFriday evening in February, Imperial\u2019s Gaelic footballers made\ntheir way to Birmingham for the club\u2019s\nsecond appearance at the British Universities championships. After a good\nnight\u2019s sleep, we made the trip out\nto Coventry where finding the pitch\nproved easier than initially imagined,\nas the British University GAA representative\u2019s eye-brows were easier to\nspot than Toby Davis\u2019 ginger mop. Our\nfirst game was against Aston University, who shocked everyone including\nthemselves by scoring an extremely\nquestionable first goal after only a\nminute of play. However, a goal in\nquick response from Man of the Tournament Sean Dunne soon put things\nright and a sideline score from Eddie\nFitzpatrick nudged Imperial in front.\nThe second half saw Imperial domi-nate, with Padhraig Comerford in his\ndebut year and Phil Jakeman patrolling\nthe wings. After the final whistle Imperial had won 9 points to 5.\nImperial\u2019s second game against Stirling had a cagey start, eventually Vinny\nMcGaughan linked up with former St.\nMalachy\u2019s teammate Frankie O\u2019Neill to\ndrill the ball into the back of the net.\nStirling however, fought back, leaving\nthe half-time score Imperial 1-0, Stirling 0-2. In a tough, physical game, the\nsecond half was even closer than the\nfirst and after a quick score from our\ntoken Safa Paddy Heugh, the heroic\nwork of Chris Farrell and Neil Clancy\nin defence ensured we were still ahead.\nWith Stirling continuously threaten-ing, the game was not truly put to bed\nuntil Finian McCann gathered a loose\nball on the halfway line, rounded three\nmen and duly dispatched the ball from\nthirty yards. Imperial ran out comfortable winners.\nEventual finalists Sunderland were\nnext up, and showed themselves to be an\nimpressive outfit. Two well-taken frees\nfrom Jimmy Haugh and some Trojan\ndefence work from Mark Jennings, Ed O\u2019\nHare and Vinny McGaughan keeping us\nin contention. Imperial\u2019s fitness eventually let them down and Sunderland managed to convert a broken ball in midfield\ninto a shock goal, and another well-taken\nchance killed off the game for Imperial.\nOur final game against Cambridge\nwas inconsequential but we were determined to go out fighting. After two stunning goals from Meathman Sean Dunne,\ncombined with energetic off-the-ball\nmovement from balding Stephen Gallagher, Imperial were 8 points to 7 ahead\nwith 4 minutes to play. Newbies Alan\nWebb and Harry Evans had a baptism of\nfire, with Webb unlucky to give away a\npenalty. Jimmy Haugh pulled off a wonder save to keep Imperial in front, but\nthe next Cambridge attack saw them finally score a winning goal, leaving Andy\nLavery\u2019s late point as a mere consolation\nas Cambridge went on to win 10 points\nto 9.\nIt was a disappointing end to a day that\nstarted so well; until next year!\nGaelic football report from the BUGAA championships\nFinian McCann Gaelic Football\nShort sleeves, short shorts, rolled down socks. It\u2019s 1970s football, with gloves\n\u201cWe then let ourselves down and lost\nthe third set to come back with some\nnitty-gritty blocking by Harry Fredheim and Kees De Hoogh in set 4,\u201d said\nSch\u00e4pert\u00f6ns.\nThe win means they have gained\npromotion for next season to Division\n1. They finish the season unbeaten on\ncourt, but accidently missed one fixture due to a combination of forgetfull-ness and clerical errors.\nLooking forward to next season,\nthere is little cause for concern: \u201cThe\nonly player that will be leaving us from\nour starting line-up will be Platon\nVogiatzoglou, our opposite attacker.\nWe aim to build on the success that we\nhave enjoyed in BUCS this season and\nqualify for the final 8s next year.\u201d\nThe feat of our Volleyball players\nshould not be understated; with the\nresources available to them as well as\nthe workload which dogs all Imperial students, the team are competing\nagainst Leeds Metropolitan University,\nBath and Loughborough, all of which\nare recognised as being very sport fo-cused. The prospects of the Volleyball\nteam look good for next season due to\nthe core of the team remaining.\n\u201cThe Volleyball Club would like to\ntake the opportunity to thank Ashly\nBlack and coach Ercument Karako\u00e7,\u201d\nsaid their Captain.\nThe volleyball team came joint 1st in the felixSports league.\n\n"

I am going\nto share with you a Russian holiday-favourite, broadcast every New Year\u2019s\nEve since its release on December 31,\n1975. The film is \u0418\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u0438\u043b\u0438\n\u0421 \u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c! ('Ironiya sudbi, ili S\nlyogkim parom!'), which translates to\n\u2018The Irony of Fate, or Lightly Steamed!\u2019.\nThe storyline is charming yet at the\nsame time loosely critical of the Soviet\nsystem. By this, I mean the Soviet-style\narchitecture of the Brezhnev period\n(mid-1970\u2019s), where street names and\ntower blocks were equally generic (and\nfrustratingly banal).\nThe key to the plot is that in both\nMoscow and Leningrad (as was), exist not only a 3rd Builders' street, but\nidentical housing blocks, with identical flats right down to the wallpaper\nand keys that fit both locks! A comment upon poor production standards\nperhaps? Of course, yet this charming\nfilm turns it to the hero\u2019s advantage. As\na result of this situation, our protagonist Zhenya, enjoying a drink (or two,\nor three) at a local Moscow bathhouse\nwith friends manages to board a plane\nand ends up in what he thinks is his\napartment in a totally alien city. The\noffending intruder causes havoc in the\nNew Year\u2019s Eve plans of 3rd Builder\u2019s\nStreet, Leningrad\u2019s Nadya Shevelyova\n(played by the mesmerising Polish actress Barbara Brylska) who is hoping to\nentertain her exceedingly suspicious\nbeau Ippolit that evening. However,\nthe winning charms of the charismatic\nAndrei Myagkov, who plays Zhenya,\nfrom the Russian Daywatch, Nightwatch vampire films and even more\nof you might know from the Angelina\nJolie blockbuster Wanted, directed a\nremake of Irony of Fate with twist.\nThe lead character is Kostya Lukashin,\nplayed by Konstantin Khabenskiy \u2013 a\nfavourite of Bekmambetov, for he is in\nall the aforementioned films. Kostya\nis Zhenya\u2019s son who apparently has a\ndrinking intolerance.\nAs you might guess the same plot\ncaptivates your attention for the duration of this two-part spectacle and\nleaves you hoping that he will not be\nthrown out into the cold too quickly!\nCyclical displays of machismo between Ippolit and Zhenya are punctuated by lilting lullabies and chirpy\nfolk ditties performed by the two main\ncharacters on their guitars, by way of\nfestive holiday entertainment.\nIn 2007 director Timur Bekmambetov, who some of you might recognise\nas the first film unfolds but two more,\nsenior characters are drafted in \u2013 the\noriginal Zhenya and Nadya (truly!) Although this updated version is not as\nwinning as the first, Bekmambetov has\ncertainly achieved something brilliant\nby bringing back the original two actors and involving them in the story. It\nis as if the film has taken on a life of\nits own \u2013 not just as a production with\npaid actors, but a true Russian fair-ytale! - RM\nA fairytale romance in Leningrad (or St. Petersburg?)\nT\nhe Haunch of Venison gallery is an impressive space\nfor works in the nature of\nNon-Conformist art of\n1980's Soviet Russia. One\ncan be in two minds about their suitability in such a space: is the meaning\ndrowned out by the high ceilings and\npalace-like halls, or is the art finally\nsaluted as its true intention serves: to\nmimic and make example of the Socialist Realism that was close to ridiculous in its pomp and superficiality?\nGlasnost: Soviet Non-Conformist\nArt from the 1980s features an array\nof familiar symbols and messages: red\nstars, sickles and politicians. However,\nthis is not official imagery and there is\na wicked slant to every piece of work.\nNames of dissident realist artists such\nas Komar and Melamid feature, as well\nas works by conceptualists Ilya Kabakov and Erik Bulatov. Works range from\nsculpture to photographs and the most\ngratifying: photo-realist paintings,\nwhich demonstrate a heightened sense\nof awareness of the power of painting\nto move and persuade the viewer.\nA series of paintings by Semyon Faibisovich under the titles 'In The Line\nfor Vodka' and 'The Line for Vodka II'\nhighlight the banality and frustration\nin Soviet life, in order just to gain a little native pleasure.\nArt of this period was produced\nmainly under the radar and this tension and secrecy is missing in a survey\nsuch as this. We are fortunate to be\nable to witness such a large grouping of\nSergei Borisov, \u2018Defile\u2019 of 1987\nTwo visitors look on at Faibisovich\u2019s snapshots of desperate times in Russia, where even small luxuries were infrequent\nThe original Nadya and Zhenya from the 1975 film in a more sombre moment The protagonists of the 2007 remake. Will their parents be reunited at last?\npaintings here.\nWhat is liberating about non-con-formist art is how it manages to maintain or reinterpret the wit and genius,\nperhaps, of artistic freedom, especially\nunder conditions of such a prescribed\nformat for making art as the Socialist\nRealist style was.\n\n"

Most of you\nprobably know me through RAG, which\nI\u2019ve been fortunate to chair this year. I\nam also Secretary of the German Society and a\nkeen tennis player.\nOver the last three years at Imperial, I\u2019ve enjoyed\nincreasing amounts of responsibility, rising from\nordinary member to president of RAG. As DPE,\nI can provide the Union with a healthy balance of\nexperience and a fresh perspective. My aim is to address issues which are central to the student body\nas a whole. These include introducing a maximum\nnumber of coursework deadlines you can be assigned in one week and improving the coursework\nfeedback system. Past exam solutions should also\nbe available to all students, and not restricted to individual departments. Students should be allowed\nto have a say in shaping their academic experience,\nand therefore I plan on working closely with the\nstudent media outlets to maintain transparency\nand gather your inputs. I will also make it a priority\nto ensure that strong postgraduate representation\nis restored.\nSo why vote for me?\nI\u2019m approachable, hardworking, honest and most\nimportantly passionate about all positions I hold.\nAs RAG chair I\u2019ve managed to more than double\nour charitable donation from the last two years\ncounted together, and raise its profile by introducing a vast number of events like LOST. I also sit on\nthe central Union boards (Council and RWB) as the\nchair of a President\u2019s club.\nAlexander Dahinten\nA\ns a second year student, there are 2 major complaints I have with Imperial:\nIf one department is consistently getting\nbetter SOLE results and higher student sat-isfaction, why can\u2019t all the others?\nI have 2 weeks to produce coursework, why does it\ntake my department 6 months to get it back to me?\nThe College wants to change. They want to keep the\nexcellent academic reputation we have and improve\nstudent experience too. We can help them make the\nright choices by using a strong representation net-works, people like you, your year reps, dep reps and all\nthe way to the union President.\nThis past year, the focus has been clearly defining the\nrepresentation network, something which was previously a bit of a mystery. Next year, I will work hard\nwith the President, DPW and union staff, by training\nstudent reps and supporting them better so their voice\nis listened to by College.\nIt is imperative you pick the right candidate who can\nrepresent your views to college and be taken seriously.\nI\u2019m not promising anything I can\u2019t deliver. For Imperial\nto be an excellent university we need consistency of\ngrades, good feedback to students to show them how\nto improve, and we need departments to share best\npractice.\nPlease take 5 minutes to visit www.chrisdarby.com to\nfind out more information about my involvement this\nyear and how I plan to push college in the right direction next year.\nChristopher Darby\nI\nhave been much involved with many aspects of\nthe Union in my 3 years at Imperial and gathered thorough understanding of how it works.\nNow I want to give something back and represent the students\u2019 voice with regards to academic\nmatters over the next year and make this an even\nbetter place.\nWe all know that Imperial has an exceptional\nacademic reputation and attracts the brightest\nminds from all over the world, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean everything is running at its best. The\nstudent voice needs to be heard and communication with the teaching staff improved for\neveryone to get the best out of their student\nexperience.\nFor this to happen, I will aim to improve the effectiveness of SOLE and increase tutor student\ninteraction beyond the pastoral care obligation.\nFeedback is the best way for everybody to speak\nup and productively influence teaching, yet participation is low and so is the outcome, which calls\nfor improvement. Tutors are very important, but\neven more underestimated than SOLE. I am sure\nthat both the teaching staff and the students, un-der- and postgraduates, will profit from immediate\nfeedback.\nI will seek to improve lecture notes and guidance\nthroughout your course and beyond the commemoration ceremony. A degree from Imperial is a great\nachievement and deserves to have more value than\nit has at the moment, which is a message that needs\nto reach the companies you aim to be involved with.\nSo vote for me!\nStefan Bauer\nThe DPE is responsible for coordinating and training the\nrepresentation network, which includes all of the academic reps, and holding regular academic forums to gather\nstudent opinion about issues related to their course. They\nwill sit on a number of college committees including those\nrelating to both undergraduate and postgraduate edu-cation, e-portfolios, careers and the student experience.\nTheir purpose for attending is to represent student views\nwith the aim of making the academic experience at Imperial one of the best in the world.\nDEPUTY PRESIDENT\n(EDUCATION)\nI\nf you thought elections were over, you were wrong. Last\nterm you elected a new Sabbatical team, and at the beginning of this term you elected a new Government, sort of.\nThe Summer Term traditionallly elects positions of the\nUnion that are also vital to it\u2019s running. These include Council\nChair, RAG (Raising and Giving) Chair, CAG (Community Action\nGroup) Chair, Equal Oppurtunities Officer, and an Union Entertainments Commitee.\nThis year\u2019s Summer Elections have been made that bit more\nexciting after the Deputy President (Education) elected in the\nSabbatical Elections resigned early this term.\nThe candidate elected will take up the position on the 1st of\nJuly and spend a full year tending to the educational welfare of\nImperial\u2019s students.\nBoth candidates for this position in the original election have\nended up taking graduate positions at investment banks.\nStudent Trustee is the other position up for grabs from last\nterm also. This is another chance to fill the four trustee posts\navailable in the Union.\nVoting opens 24 May at 00:01 and closes on the 27 May at\n23:59. Votes will be counted and results will be announced 28\nMay. If nothing else, expect some more free sweets.\nSummer\n2010\n\n"

Here in the \u201cWest\u201d in modern\ntimes we are still left with that grey image of what communist life was like in\nthat time, and little is done to change\nthis conception. So it is with some surprise that one beholds Valeriy Todorovskiy\u2019s 2008 film Stilyagi \u2013 the glossy,\nshiny portrayal of this uniform and\ncharacterless Soviet Moscow. Except it\nisn\u2019t quite colourless: far from it.\nIt is 1955 and bands of pretty, young\nStilyagi (literally \u2018style hunter\u2019, translated as Dandy) are shocking and enraging the conformists with their luridly\ncoloured snappy suits and ties, tight\ntrousers, Grease-lightnin\u2019 hair styles\nand American sex drives. They care\nless for communist values and more\nfor jazz, swing, rock \u2018n roll, boogie-woogie and cavorting in dance halls.\nStilyagi does not, as most musicals\ndo, open with a song or any music.\nInstead, what one sees is the steel-uniformed Komsomol (Communist\nUnion of Youth) sneaking up on an illegal rave, bursting in and breaking it\napart, cutting off clothing, stockings\nand braids as they do so. During the\nchase, the wide-eyed Mels comes face\nto face with the beautiful Polina, a.k.a.\nPolly, who invites the young Bolshevik\nto \u2018Broadway\u2019 the following day. Mels\nturns up, has his named abbreviated to\nMel and so begins his lifestyle as a style\nhunter, engaging in dark alley dealings\nto procure garish suits, illegally made\nvinyls printed on X-rays (\u201cBones\u201d) and\nsaxophones: just as deadly in that context as a \u2018cold steel\u2019 gun.\nStilyagi is beautiful to behold from\nstart to finish, looking every bit as\npleasing as any equivalent Hollywood\nversion would. The Stilyagi themselves\nare gorgeous, sporting some truly\nwonderful costumes and bringing a\nhefty dose of fun and gay abandon into\ntheir dreary and stifling historical set-ting. The songs \u2013words, choreography\nand score \u2013 are excellent, with the lyrics a lot more abstract and thought\nprovoking than the musicals we are\nused to back in democracy (\u201cBounded\nby one chain/ Connected with one\naim\u201d). Viewers averse to them will be\nspared any over-ecstatic dance rou-tines, which can often break the flow\nof the story and make the whole proceedings seem a bit farcical.\nIn addition to some wonderfully fun\ncinema, one is treated to an interesting insight into the day to day life in\nthat time from the large, bourgeois\nflats that were converted into squalid,\ncommunal housing for fifty, the risk\nof being sent to a labour camp for 3-5\nyears for profiteering from the sale of\nWestern music, to the reality of the\nCommunist classless society when one\nsees the flat owned by Stilyagi frontman Fred\u2019s diplomat parents. No small\ndetail is spared in the presenting this\nsnapshot of Red reality, including Mels\nname: an acronym of Communism\u2019s\nfounding fathers Marx, Engels, Lenin\nand Uncle Joe Stalin.\nStilyagi brings together many elements of similar other musicals based\nupon the youth of around that time.\nThe obvious comparison is with Grease\nwith its hand-jive dance moves and\ncinched in waists, but in Stilyagi we see\nelements of our favourite T-birds Kinicki, Putzy and Danny Zucko in Fred,\nthe chubby Bob and Mel. Another musical with which it shares clear links is\nHair (recently arrived in London from\nBroadway) \u2013 young people with a desire to be different and have control\nwhile battling against what the government is trying to enforce. In Hair it\nwas the threat of being sent to \u2018Nam.\nHere it is Fred who faces his own \u2018Nam\nand moral dilemma: ditch the hair, the\nclothes, go to America and return as a\nSoviet diplomat or stay in Moscow as a\nDandy. Like Claude in Hair, he chooses\n\u2018Nam.\nAlthough Khrushchev\u2019s \u201cthaw\u201d on\nU.S.S.R. isolation from 1957 meant foreigners were thence allowed through\nthe Iron Curtain and the ban on jazz\nwas lifted, meaning the youth had no\ncause to enjoy western culture in such a\nrebellious and clandestine manner, the\nStilygi movement was pivotal in paving\nthe way for subsequent generations of\n\u2018beatniks\u2019 (punks, Goths, rastas) to exist more legitimately in Russia.\nIf you are intrigued by what else\nmodern Russian cinema has to offer,\ncheck out vampire flick Night Watch\nor Soviet War drama the 9th Company.\nBoogie bones or dandies?
