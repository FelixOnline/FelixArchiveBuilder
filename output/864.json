    "content": "Richard Heap explains the world of paper recycling. Printed on 100% recycled paper.\nPaper chasing\n56% of all fibres used in the UK's paper production\nare reclaimed, putting us fourth in the world. So\nwhat's the fuss? Of the nine million tonnes of paper\nwe consume every year, less than half is made here,\nthe rest is imported. This makes our record somewhat\nless impressive, putting us below the global average.\nEveryone must become involved, at home and at\nwork, if Chris Patten's statement to recycle 50% of\ndomestic waste in the next decade is to become a reality.\nBut why should we recycle? 'The benefits of\nrecycling are obvious; rarely do environmental and\neconomic factors so unambiguously support the same\ngoal.'-(Fourth Report, Trade & Industry Committee\n1984 Wealth of Waste.) Economically it is essential.\nPaper imports, at \u00a33.2 billion per annum are the fourth\nbiggest contributors to the trade and deficit figures.\nAdded to this is the increasing cost of land filling waste. Each one of us will pay for this through Poll\nTax, interest rates and inflation.\n'The government may say that recycling must be\neconomically viable, but it is questionable whether our\npresent way of living is viable in the long run without\nvery much more recycling. Perhaps the government\nshould extend its profit and loss accounting to cover\nthe loss to future generations as well as our own. It\nis an ecological truth, as well as an economic one, that\nthere is no such thing as a free lunch.' [Sunday\nTelegraph 9.3.86.)\nPredictions for the next ten years, show a pulp\nshortage in the West. This, combined with our need\nto cut imports to the UK, has led to plans for new mills\nand plantations. Afforestation plans include areas\nsuch as the Flow Country in Caithness. The only Peat\nBog of its kind, it is home to many rare species, but\nover 50% of it is under threat. Similar problems are\noccur ing in the tropical regions where tree species,\ninappropriate to the area, are being planted, damaging\nthe soil.\nApart from providing a source of pulp, recycling also\nsaves energy and cuts pollution. Many people only\nconsider the energy required for processing materials\nand do not a count for the collection of raw materials\nand the safe disposal of the product after it has been\nused. Recycling, generally, saves at all these stages.\nOffice collections, such as the scheme established\nat Imperial, where the staff segregate their white\nquality waste paper from the general refuse, are\nessential for further paper recycling. Although some\nsorting of the collected paper is inevitable, it is ideal\nfor making printing and writing papers. Despite this,\n95% will go into non-recoverable tissues. High prices\nof recycled printing papers, due to the small scale of\nproduction has dampened demand. But demanding\nrecycled printing paper without increasing the supply\nof high grade waste will only push up the price of\nrecycled pulp. At present, the tissue industry absorbs\nany over-supply of white office waste. This will\nremain so, until more incentive is given for mills to\nproduce high grade recycled paper.\n'Barring legislation, extra recycling of high quality\nwaste is only likely to come about due to increase in\nprices of virgin pulp, or significantly increased\ncollection of sorted paper from offices.' Tom\nMockridge-Maricef Barriers to Paper Recycling\nFriends of the Earth 1990.\nCaution should also be given here as several of the\nnew recycled papers coming out use pre consumer mill\nwaste and so technically may not be called recycled.\nNo standards exist, as yet, to define what exactly\nconstitutes recycled paper.\nIn 1981 the EEC passed a Council Recommendation\nthat member states should define and implement\npolicies to encourage paper recycling, and encourage\nproducts which do not preclude subsequent recycling.\nThe response has been poor, although in 1984\nDenmark passed a voluntary Act prohibiting materials\nwhich prevent the recycling of paper and board.\nSo what can we do? Until office recycling schemes\nbecome more widespread, the demand must be put\non papers (tissues, printing and packaging) made from\nlower grade waste (newspaper etc). This means using\nphotocopier papers such as Recyconomic and\nFortuna, which perform well but are aesthetically\ndifferent, and brown toilet paper. Criticism of these\npapers comes from experience of older lower quality\nrecycled papes. These woody papers are much\ncheaper than virgin pulp papers, but are difficult to buy\nin the UK, as virtually all the mills here use higher\nwood-free waste grades. Many stationery suppliers\ncan offer these papers, but the two addresses below\nspecialise in them:\nTraidcraft (recycled paper catalogue)\nKingsway, Gateshead NE11 ONE.\nTel (091) 487 3191.\nPaperback\nBow Triangle, Business Centre,\nUnit 2 Eleanor Street,\nLondon E3 4NP. Tel: 01-980 2233.\nTREES\nSix species of tree are commonly used in paper\nmaking: pine, spruce, fir, birch, eucalyptus and poplar.\nConifers make up the largest proportion, coming from\nNorth America and Scandinavia. The hardwoods\ncome from the tropics, Spain and South America.\nVirtually all the trees are grown on sustainable\nplantations where re planting often exceeds felling.\nGood as it sounds new plantations are needed to meet\nthe increasing demand for pulp. Unfortunately, as\nmonocultures they are poor habitats for wildlife. Many\nof the new plantations will cover rare habitats, or land\nunsuitable for intensive forestry.\nPROCESSING\nRequires a large energy input, and is a major source\nof pollution. There are three main pulping processes:\n\u2022 Mechanical (woody)-produced by grinding, gives\na high percentage ye il d, although it produces a low\ngrade paper as some fibres are still bound together by\nthe lignin.\n\u2022 Chemical (wood free)-uses acid/alkaline solutions\nto dissolve the lignin which holds the fibres together.\nThe yield is less than 50% but the paper produced is\nof higher quality and does not yellow with age, as with\nmechanical grades.\n\u2022 Chemo-mechanical-uses more dilute chemical\nsolutions combined with grinding. The yield is higher\nbut not all the lignin is removed.\nMethods are being developed to increase the yield by\nusing more of each tree.\nPage 10\nMILLS\nIn the mill, paper quality is determined by using fibres\nfrom different trees. In general, the longer coniferous\nwood fibres are used for strength, while deciduous\nfibres add bulk. To increase binding, the pulp is put\nthrough a beater, which frays the ends of the fibres.\nThis shortens them, which is why it is impossible to\nrecycle paper indefinitely.\nChina clay is then added to increase opacity. After\nbeing laid out on a former the paper runs through up\nto 50 drying rollers at a speed of 200m/ min, leaving\nit with a moisture content of 3%.\nPRODUCTION FIGURES\nWorldwide, 29% of paper and board is made from\nwaste material. In the UK the figure is slightly lower.\nThe packaging industry, the biggest consumer, uses\n85% reclaimed fibres. Printing and writing papers\nmake up the biggest market, but use only 5% recycled\nmaterial. Recovery of this grade is much higher, but\nthe fibres are then used in producing lower grade\npaper.\nNot all paper is made from wood fibres. Plans are\nbeing made to build a mill using straw as a fibre\nsource. Atlhough a more expensive process is needed,\nthe raw materials are cheap because of the ban on\nstubble burning. If it goes ahead this will ease the\npressure of increased afforestation, but could make\nthe recycling process more complicated.\n\n"

    "content": "COLLECTION\nNot all types of paper are worth collecting-for\nexample, a recent 75% drop in the price of newspaper\nhas made it uneconomical for most merchants. At the\nsame time, increased demand for recycled paper has\nraised the value of the higher grade waste. Waste\npaper prices are also dependent on the amount of print\nand coatings on it, as these have to be removed during\nreprocessing.\nBefore being sold to the mills, primary processing\nis done by paper merchants, who sort and bail the\npaper. Most mills employ their own merchants, but\nwill also buy from independent merchants whose\nbiggest markets are Europe and India.\nSORTING\nThe paper industry classifies waste paper into 66\ndifferent grades. Generally speaking, paper grades\naffect the recycling process according to the rule\n'what goes in, comes out'-ie high grade recycled\npaper can only be obtained from high grade waste.\nSorting waste into the correct grades is very\nimportant, contamination of the wrong grade or\nplastics and glue will disfigure the final product and\ncan even break the paper web, stopping production\nfor several hours. Sorting of paper by mills or\nmerchants is uneconomical; correct segregation at\nsource is therefore essential. This relies on educating\npeople and raising their awareness of recycling.\nTHE RECYCLING MILL\nA combination of steam and grinding are used to\nre pulp paper. Depending on the final product and the\nquality of the paper put in, de in king processes may\nbe used, although worldwide this is done on only 16%\nof the paper reclaimed. Chemicals are added to either\ndisperse contaminants or coagulate them, which then\nsettle out or are filtered off by a series of strainers.\nBleaches can be used, but their effluent is highly toxic,\nso to give the product its desired degree of whiteness,\ndifferent grades of waste paper are used.\nUnfortunately, until we change our attitude towards\nbrown recycled toilet paper, high grade paper will be\nwasted simply to make white tissues.\nWASTE & LANDFILL\nGreater London alone produces 12 million tonnes of\ncommercial waste per year. Imperial itself produces\napproximately 1,000 tonnes per annum. About 30%\nis paper and board, of which 100 tonnes is high grade,\nwhite paper. The total cost of disposal is nearly \u00a340\nper tonne. As landfill sites around London fill up\nalternative disposal methods will become essential.\nAs much as 60% of this waste could be recycled!\nGrapevine\n'Real sherry comes only from Spain' and on Tuesday\nwe were treated to part of the \u00a31 million campaign\nto promote this fact. In an attempt to reach Imperial\nCollege students, Brian and Jenny Buckingham, of the\nSherry Institute of Spain, tutored us though a range\nof seven very different wines.\nThe word 'sherry' is the English misconception of\n'Sherish', the moorish name of the Jerez region of\nSpain. All real sherry is made from the Palomino grape\ngrown in this area. During fermentation, two distinct\nwines evolve: fi no and ol oros. Flor, a natural yeast,\ndistinguishes the two; it grows naturally on fi no and\nis not present on ol oros. While maturing in casks made\nonly of American white oak, the flor imparts a musty,\nyeasty flavour to the fi no and protects it from\noxidation, preserving and enhancing its fine, delicate\nflavours. Meanwhile, the ol or oso darkens and\ndevelops into a deep and rich wine. These two form\nthe basis for all other sherries: creams, amontillado s, cort a dos, and manzan ill as. The sherries we tasted ranged in sweetness from\nbone dry to syrupy sweet. We started with a light\ngolden-coloured wine from San Patricio which was the\nessence of afi no: so dry and yeasty and yet with\nremarkable honey and apple overtones. The second\nwine was tasted was one of the evening's favourites.\nIt was an incredibly aromatic old amontillado from\nHarvey's with rich, nutty, toffee-ish, leathery flavours\nand a perfect salty-dry finish. The other favourite was\nan amazing ol or oso, the Royal Corregidor from\nSandeman. This wine had a coffee-brown-green\ncolour and burst with cough medicine, figs and clove\nflavours.\nWe were told it was quite possible that the Romans\nfirst brought sherry to England. Most certainly, it was\nwell en grained in our society by the time of Chaucer.\nDespite this long and noble association with the\nEnglish palate, most of us dismiss sherry as part of\nGranny's Christmas ritual. This is the image the Sherry\nInstitute is confronting in its re-education programme.\nWe were left with the impression of a thriving, multi-million pound industry, firmly rooted in a region rich\nwith tradition and good living.\nWe hope to see you at our forthcoming events:\n\u2022 Tuesday 13 March-White Bordeaux by Dave\nRowe, Hon Pres, Editor of 'Decanter'.\n\u2022 Wednesday 14 March-Coffee Tasting by Mary\nBanks, London Coffee Information Centre.\n\u2022 Tuesday 20 March-Alsace Wines by Russell and\nMclver.\n\u2022 Wednesday 21 March-Booze Cruise Shopping\nSpree to Boulogne.\n\u2022 Tuesday 1 May-Austrian Wines by the Austrian\nWine Information Centre.\nDon't miss our special offer in the Bookshop: greatly\nreduced wine guide which include a discount on\nsociety events.\nSalud!\nP.S. All tasting s held at 6pm in the Union Senior\nCommon Room. Contact Kevin McKoen on extension\n6851 for further information.\nRag\nThere is one last big Rag event this term: the Around\nthe City Pub Crawl/Treasurehunt. This is a new event\nand is being organised by MENCAP on Wednesday\nMarch 14. The format will be that teams of 3-6,\npreferably in fancy dress, register in the JCR between\n12.30 and 1.30pm, are given a clue list of several\npubs in the City and a collecting can each. The aim\nis to find all your designated pubs in the right order\nand try and collect as much money along the way.\nAs with Monopoly extra points will be given for\ninteresting items brought back and MENCAP are\nproviding several prizes-it should be a fun day for all\nso please turn up and drag a few friends along.\nOther than that, there is a Rag Raid to Cambridge\non Saturday March 17 and to Guildford on Wednesday\nMarch 21. For more information on these events\nplease turn up to the Rag meeting today in the Union\nLounge at 12.30. Finally just an advanced warning of\nthe only Rag event that happens next term: Rag Fete\non May 12, complete with chocolate mouse\nwrestling, dwarf throwing and 'where will the animal\ndump?'. If clubs or societies would like to do anything\nfor it, could they please see Fiona Nicholas in the\nUnion Office.\nBass Dance\nBass Dance, one of England's top reggae bands come\nto the Union Lounge tonight. Fronted by Basil\nGabbidon, a former member of Steel Pulse, Brum's favourite reggae stars are here for a night of sweet\nroots y rocking. More commercial than Steel Pulse,\nthey still keep an innovative streak, resisting the\ntempting slide towards UB40-\\sm, and the softening\nof reggae's essential roughness.\nCombining the classic hard edged beats with their\nown more radical approach, using a selection of\nsyn the d and sampled sounds, Bass Dance provide\nmusic with raw energy. One minute playing dance pop\nsongs like Starlight and the next there is steaming rock\nguitar solos and African rhythm.\nSo come and enjoy yourself tonight. Be lifted by the\nmusic, put a smile on y or face and get sk ank in'. Doors open at 8pm, with Red Ten as the fine\nsupport act, on stage at 9.30-ish. The bar s nd disco\nrun until late, with DJ Gwynmuffin kicking out his\nusual freewheeling mix of the steamiest on vinyl.\nTickets are \u00a32 in advance or \u00a31 with Ents cards, from\nthe Union Office.\nRufus Isaacs, Ents Publicity.\nAnti-Poll Tax\nIC Autonomous Anti-Poll Tax Group will be holding its\nfirst meeting above Southside Bar, 1pm, Tuesday\nMarch 13, to discuss how to organise and fight this\nunfair, extortionate and intrusive tax. Every day\nopposition to it grows, even from the Tory ranks! All\nwelcome.\nFilmSoc\nThis coming Thursday sees a highlight of the FilmSoc\ncalendar, with a showing of Sex, Lies & Videotape.\nOne of the surprise hits of last year, this con travers i al, award-winning film focuses on the sexual hang-ups\nof four people living in steamy Baton-Rouge.\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "A tale of two societies\nDear Dave,\nIn reply to Anil Loadwa's letter last week (FELIX\n862), I feel that it is necessary to refute the allegations\nthat he has made against myself and Asian Society\nand also to 'disclose a few points which I think\neveryone has the right to know (especially the\nmembers) about the life story of Asian Society'...\nThis brings me onto my first point. I think the reader\nshould be aware that Anil Loadwa, Mech Eng 3 does\nnot even exist! So, this causes even greater doubt\nabout the authenticity of his allegations and leads me\nto believe that it was written by someone (or some\npersons) who have some sort of personal vendetta\nagainst Asian Soc. It seems both incredible and\npointless to me that there are people out there who\nget kicks out of making accusations against Asian\nSoc, especially when they are totally unsound and\nuntrue.\nThe 'only reason' why Asian Soc was set up was,\nas was clearly stated by its constitution: to promote\nand publicise the culture of Asia. It was not an 'ego\ntrip' and whoever believes such has been seriously\nmisled! The Union requires at least twenty signatures\nfor the formation of any College society. In the case\nof Asian Soc, 135 signatures were presented. The\npeople who signed the petition were informed of the\nreasons for setting up the society and signed because\nthey understood and approved of the idea-not\nbecause they were forced to. The Union, on the basis\nof the remarkable interest shown, passed the motion\nfor it to become a constituent society of the OSC and\nnot because of the help of 'contacts' or my 'dear\nfriend Wouter (OSC Chairman)' or indeed 'former India\nSoc president Kob'.\nI am pleased to observe that Anil is a 'member of\nthe Asian Soc' and that he joined it 'because it was\nmeant to represent a more cultured part of Asia'. Also,\nhe is correct in assuming that 'this is why Asian Soc\nwas not merged with the Indian Soc'. However, what\nAnil incorrectly states is that 'the actual reason the\ntwo societies did not merge was because they would\nhave had to have re-election for which Bhart was not\ntoo keen on'. The facts explain why and are as\nfollows:\nFollowing approval of the Society by the Union last\nsummer, it was decided that a 'caretaker' committee\nbe chosen to help in its running and welfare until such\na time that the society would have members who\nwould be allowed to elect in the existing or a new\ncommittee democratically (after all, there is no sense\nin having elections without an electorate). Following\nFreshers' Fair in October, the Society attracted up to\n100 members. Election papers for every post including\npresident for this year's committee (89/90) were put\nup on November 27 and every member of the society\nwas informed of the exact time and place of the\nelections about two weeks prior to this.\nThe whole fiasco of a 'merger' between Asian Soc\nand Indian Soc was raised and discussed several times\nsoon after the Freshers' Reception. However, not only\nwas the 'caretaker' committee of Asian Soc against\nthe idea but many of its members when approached,\nfelt that it would be best to keep the two societies\nseparate judging on the nature of India Soc the year\nbefore. To eliminate any animosity and friction, it was\nmutually agreed by the Presidents of both societies\nthat they would keep out of each other's way and that\nthey would organise their own activities and inform\neach other of their plans to avoid 'clashes' or conflict\nof interests.\nSo, the decision for a non-merger was not a personal one as suggested by Anil but one that was\nagreed by many.\nAs far as re-elections are concerned, I am prepared,\neven now, to call the members of both societies if\nthat's what they want and take a democratic vote for\na merger. Let me make it clear that I am not, and never\nwas, bothered about holding the title of Mr President.\nI was only ever concerned at attempting to present\nto Asians a 'different side' to the events and activities\nthat many of them are presently accustomed to. This\ndoes not mean that I disagree with discos and the\nlike-only that I feel it is important to appreciate that\nsome of us still have a strong sense of culture and\ntradition and enjoy the opportunity of attending\n'cultural' events. It is a simple case of catering to the\ntastes of a different audience.\nI would also like to point out that the organisation\nof a cultural event at College takes considerably more\ntime, thought and coordination that a normal 'disco-type' event. Financially speaking, a cultural event is\nsometimes not as 'safe' as a disco-type event since\nit is difficult to predict a large, guaranteed student\nattendance. This was reflected by the first event that\nAsian Soc held on November 7 1989 which was\ncultural. Despite extensive publicity throughout the\nUniversity of London, the event was not a financial\nsuccess although of those that attended, each went\naway feeling that they had witnessed something quite\nunique. Yes, 'there were at least 100 people there'\nand yes, 'the tickets for the event were sold at an\naverage price of five pounds'. But unfortunately 'Anil',\nsince you weren't there, it probably didn't occur to\nyou what the expenses amounted to for the band,\nsound, lighting and publicity costs. Had you such\ninsight, then you would have restrained yourself from\ninsinuating naive suggestions such as 'all this adds up\nto a substantial income. So surely....we must search\nfor the money in Swiss bank accounts?' Also, though\nit may disappoint you, the Union and the OSC have\n'made a sufficient enquiry on this matter'. Every\npenny that has ever been spent or earn t by Asian Soc\nhas been acc un ted for in black and white so I see no\nreason for the Union or the OSC ever being 'afraid of\nlosing face'. As far as my 'ego writing cheques the\nsociety couldn't cash' is concerned-well, I think,\nAnil, it is always unwise to jump to rash and false\nconclusions without some sort of corroborating\nevidence to back them up!\nAs far as the allegations pertaining to the so-called\n'running of the society' are concerned, I would like\nto clear up a few misunderstandings. Although Anil\nseems convinced that 'the treasurer resigned due to\nquote 'dictatorship'...' perhaps, had he asked the\ntreasurer in question why he really resigned, then he\nwould have discovered that the real reason was due\nto quote 'excessive workload'. I would like to\nemphasise here that I believe that the success of any\nsociety rests upon the strength of its committee. If\ncertain members of that committee are not prepared\nto offer their sincere services and accept a 'fair share'\nof the responsibilities, then the President has only two\nreal alternatives-either to sit back and watch that\nsociety deteriorate or to have the courage to 'take-on' those responsibilities in order to keep that society\n'alive'. If the latter is construed as a 'dictatorship' then\nit is surely a great sign of misapprehension.\nIf Anil, as a 'member of Asian Soc' feels that he can\ncontribute something constructive to the welfare of\nthe society, then I invite him to step forward and\nparticipate in its running. Otherwise, please do not\nmislead the readers of FELIX and especially the 'real'\nmembers of Asian Soc by conjuring up stories under\nsome sort of pseudonym.\nYours,\nBartendu Gyas (DoC 2).\nI am sick to death of jerk-offs like Anil Loadwa,\nwho feel they have the right to write letters to\nFELIX under a pseudonym. Letters are accepted\nin good faith. Frequently the content of our mail\nbag d is u ades us from asking for a Union card\ncheck. If you want the freedom to write to FELIX\nyou should have the honesty to put your real name\nat the end of a letter. We can withhold names and\nwe do not reveal them in these cases-Ed.\nThose callous Conservatives again\nDear Sir,\nWith reference to your article on the ConSoc poster\nof 23.2.90 'Support the Ambulance Workers, let the\nPatients Die' I thought you might be interested in the\nfollowing incident.\nWhilst attending as medic in the College ambulance\non Saturday 3.3.90 we were called to deal with a person who had collapsed and stopped breathing in\nKensington High Street. When we arrived artificial\nres u citation had already been performed on the\ncasualty by a member of the London Ambulance\nService who was collecting money nearby. If he had\nnot done this the casualty would have certainly died.\nOnce all life systems were working again he called the\nL.A.S. directly and incident ly from the normal 999\nchannels to give us better information on the locality\nand disposition of the casualty. He also was good\nenough to give a statement to the local police.\nIt is therefore blatantly clear that it is not the\nambulance workers who gain support from people\ndying in the street, but the callous attitude of certain\nmembers of Her Majesty's Government and their\nsupporters.\nIf the statement on the poster was the Conservative\nSociety's idea of satire then it has surely backfired,\nas a large proportion of the drivers and medics\noperating the College ambulance are Trade Union\nofficials within the College (including myself) and one\nof the rules of any Trade Union is to preserve life (there\nis no such rule in the constitution of the Conservative\nParty).\nSince ConSoc is so concerned on this matter I am\nsure they will make a donation to the Imperial College\nAmbulance Fund to help pay for the replacement of\nthe vehicle paid for by students' efforts in 1979.\nN.

    "content": "certain areas isn't facilitating the achievement of the\nlevels of service we need and which I think we could\noffer.'\nHe also felt that 'there is a need on the\nadministrative side to create a good career structure\nfor people. Then we can maintain and retain talented\npeople, who are committed and well motivated to\nsupport the administrative and auxiliary functions and\nservices of college. I attach a great deal of importance\nto that.'\n'In terms of issues,' he remarked, 'accommodation\nis a major one. It isn't only in terms of the number of\nbeds, but the quality and standard of the\naccommodation: that is a preoccupation of the first\norder. Then there's the question of the improvement\nof the infrastructure. I don't just mean in terms of\nmaintenance but also appearance. I think we need to\nlook at ways in which to create a more sparkling\nimage of the excellent work that goes on here. You\ncould be mistaken, as you walk past here, that it isn't the kind of institution it is. Apart from making it a better place to work as a student or academic or staff\nmember, it will also help us to promote the institution\nto prospective fund giver s.' During the interview, he frequently mentioned\n'value for money'. Questioned on the impression the\nstudents had been given that he had been heavily\ninvolved in delaying the plans for an astroturf pitch\nat Harlington, he said 'I would hate anyone to think\nI'd blocked it for the sake of it. The concern which\nI had, which was shared by others, was that it was\na substantial figure and probably more than people had\nbeen given to expect. I was also aware of other\nproposals for hockey astroturf through my\ninvolvement as the governor of a school in Kent, and\nit seemed quite a large figure. There wasn't any\nevidence that I saw at that time of a full appraisal of\nthe tender in response to a clear specification. That\nis now an aspect that is being looked into.'\nHe added that he 'entirely endorsed the idea of there\nbeing a hockey pitch. I also recognise the fact that\ntime has been sliding away and there is a problem\nabout pitches for next season: we need to get on with\nit. But we need to be sure in so doing that we are\ngetting the best possible value for the money we have\ngot.' Speaking of the Harlington Gravel Trust Fund,\nwhich is funding the astroturf proposal, he said it was\n'a wonderful source of funds, but simply because it's coming out of the ground in the literal sense doesn't mean one shouldn't go through the same forms of\nappraisal that one would if one was putting up a building in College with money obtained in a more\nconventional way.'\nQuestioned about the difficult position that the\nHarlington Trustees have been placed in since the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, announced, above their heads,\nthat he would like to use some of the fund to finance\na new hall of residence, he commented, 'we are in\nthe process of clarifying their position. My\ninterpretation of earlier governing Body minutes was\nthere was an understanding that the fund would be\napplied 'for the benefit of students'. What that means\nis something which we need to have defined more\nclearly for the benefit of all.'\nHe observed that 'we know we've got a crying need\nfor improved accommodation for the students. We've\nalso got a clear requirement for improved sporting\nfacilities. I don't think the two are mutually exclusive.\nI hope that we will reflect the importance of the non-sporting side as well as sports, because I think that\nthat is something which matters to a lot of students,\nnot only the sporting ones.'\nHe has also launched investigations into how every\npart of the College functions. He said, 'a part of that\nis to enable me to get an understanding into how\npeople in the departments believe they ought to be\nrun in the future, as well as to enable us all to see what\nare the strengths and weaknesses of the way we run\ncurrently. I don't think it should be seen as a particularly targeted thing but as a general review\nwhich is going on across the board.\nPotential reorganisation of the College conjures up\nthe possibility that staffing levels may be changed.\nSpeaking on the current problems with the\nManufacturing, Science and Finance (MSF) Union, he\nsaid, 'we are not in official dispute. The situation is\nan unfortunate one, which wasn't triggered by any\naction on our part: the company to whom these\npeople were seconded decided for its own reasons to\nundergo retraction. We had to act accordingly and\nhopefully will have done so in the best interests of all\nconcerned. I 've always been reasonably optimistic\nthat, having put in a lot of effort, as we have ever\nsince we were first advised of the decision of the\ncompany, we can sort it out.'\nIn a general context, he said, T don't envisage major\nconflicts at every turn as a consequence of what we\nmight need to do to improve the way we operate.\nThere aren't any plans at this time to provoke great\nproblems all over the site.'\nAngus Fraser is appointed directly by the College's Governing Body, of which he is a member,but is\nresponsible to the Rector. He said that he didn't see\nany conflict between the Rector's remit as 'managing\ndirector of the academic side' and his own as\nmanaging director of the administrative side. He\ndescribed the Rector as being the 'chief executive' of\nthe College. 'The lines between the academic and\nadministrative sides aren't always crystal clear. There\nare people involved on both sides in many\ncommittees. I'm not aware of any fundamental\nreasons why the present structure shouldn't continue\nto work perfectly as well as it has in the past.'\nStudents and Graduates WHATEVER YOUR SUBJECT\nOPPORTUNITIES AWAIT YOU\nat The UK's most comprehensive legal information\nand recruitment event will cover vacation work,\npermanent jobs and general guidance on all\naspects of the legal profession.

A light-hearted BioSoc\nlecture by Joanthon Cowie, Thursday 18th March,\n5.30pm, West Beit Quad Rooms W2/W3.\nTHE NUCLEAR DEBATE\n'Nuclear power is the safest\npractical energy source for the\nfuture'\nPut by Dr John Gittus, Director\nGeneral of the British Nuclear Forum\nand opposed by Andy Sterling of\nGreenpeace\nLecture Theatre 220, Mech Eng,\nImperial College,\nMarch 12th,6.30 pm 'Sweden has the world's only hard-rock nuclear\nrepository': after the initial image of Swedish heavy\nmetal bands being walled up for eternity, the scale of\nthe undertaking sank in. Of all the dozens of nations\nrunning nuclear power plants, only Sweden has built\na proper waste disposal site fifty metres below the\nsea-bed in granite caverns and silos. The waste is\nencased in concrete or steel and packed in concrete-lined vaults surrounded with benton it e clay to absorb\nand deflect ground water flow. Huge carriers move\nthe waste from a special double-hulled ship down an\nelectrically heated ramp into a bright, clean automated\nworld beneath the sea, eerily quiet and smelling of\nfresh paint. Around the main control block, where\nconsoles and computers monitor the silo and the four\nstorage tunnels, there are whimsical human touches:\n1\na mock house front projects from a rock wall, and a shop mannequin in black wig and de colle te blouse\npeers out of a false window. Further on, past hanging\ntrees of green cloth, there is an old wooden skiff\nmoored to a tiny jetty beside a wall painted as a sea\nshore.\nBack up system and remote cameras are much in\nevidence-the mammoth transporter can be driven by\nremote control over electric guide cables in the floor,\nand radar in its bumpers stops it automatically before\nany solid object-human or rock.\nThis impressive site at Forsmark on the Baltic coast\n160 kilometres north of Stockholm is intended to keep\nSweden's low and medium level nuclear waste for five\nhundred years, by which time its radioactivity will\nhave decayed to normal background radiation levels.\nBut after a thousand years, the present under-sea\nrepository will be on the surface of dry land, such is\nthe rate of Sweden's iso static lift-the 'rebound' from\nthe burden of 2 kilometres depth of ice over\nScandinavia in the last Ice Age.\nThat's just one of the problems facing planners as\nthey consider what to do with the real problem-the\nspent nuclear fuel that may need to be kept safe for\n250,000 years, perhaps several ice ages. It's a problem so enormous that even the resourceful\nSwedish won't make a decision on a permanent\nrepository for another ten years.\nSweden is unique in another way too: of all the\nWestern nuclear-powered countries it alone has\ndecided by referendum to abandon nuclear power, and\nto do it without increasing C02 emissions or hydroelectric capacity. This rigid policy strait-jacket even\nhas a timetable-one nuclear station to be phased out\nin 1995, one in 1996 and the remaining ten by the\nyear 2010. The stricter timetable was adopted after\nthe Chernobyl accident-first detected in the West by\ndevices at Forsmark.\nHalf of Sweden's electricity generation is nuclear,\nand the Swedes have a high rate of energy use per\ncapita-hardly surprising given their uncompromising\nclimate. Nevertheless energy experts like Professor\nThomas Johannson of Lund University believe that the\nnuclear element can be replaced: increased efficiency,\nhe believes, could have the power demand, and\nbiomass and cogeneration schemes (using the heat\nnow wasted in the generating process) would fill the\nremainder. Bioenergy plantations of willow and alder\nwould be needed and efficient gasification processes\nused on the resultant feedstock, but on paper\nProfessor Johannson has shown that the strict\ntimetable is achievable.\nIt requires bold policy decisions, legislation and\nincentives to shape that solution: pricing changes,\nefficiency, rating of appliances, electricity service\ncompanies to improve efficiency and cut costs, and\nresearch and investments. In the ten years since the\n1980 referendum, little of this has happened and a top level ministerial team is now examining the\noptions, after hints that the timetable may be too tight\nto be realistic. Sweden's industries have threatened\nto move abroad if energy charges make them\nun competitive on world markets: the Swedish trade\nunions have also taken fright about possible job\nlosses.\nThen earlier this year, the energy portfolio was\nremoved from the resolutely anti-nuclear Environment\nMinister Brigitta Dahl and given to the new Industry\nMinister, the former Deputy Chairman of the Landsorganisationen trade union group Mr Rune Molin. Mrs\nDahl stressed to me that she was not disappointed\nin the move, and said she knew government policy\nhad not changed: she is on the ministerial review and\nthe decision in no way reflected weakening of\ngovernment resolve. Professor Johannson even\nsuggested that the move might be a pragmatic way\nof getting industry and the unions to accept the\nnuclear phase-out, under a minister more sympathetic\nto them.\nBut that is not how the public appears to see it:\nop in on polls show that although a majority still want\nthe phase out completed on time, 70% now doubt it\nwill happen. If a prosperous inventive open society like\nSweden, with a government with a clear mandate and\nan assured parliamentary majority, cannot tame the\nnuclear industry, the outlook must be bleak for anyone\nelse seeking a non-nuclear future.\n\n"

The percussion is based largely around\nand a lucian rhythms and tribal beats of the chest-pounding variety (which action Siouxsie performed\nwith surprising aplomb) but the vocal owes little to\nanybody and is delivered in classic Sioux style.\nThe crowd were appreciative from the beginning;\nthe gig had more of the atmosphere of a gathering of\nfriends than a concert, especially among the more\nhard-core admirers at the front of the pack. It took\nonly a little verve on Budgie's part to get the audience\nmoving; after that the whole event gained a momentum of its own through the war-dance\natmosphere of half the songs and the pop subtleties\nof the rest.

Every element of every track differs\nfrom any other, tracks melt into each other, via tiny\nset pieces of bizarre rhythm or flame licks of guitar.\nThey can be intense (the pounding drums of Way\nthe World is and the harrowing guitar of Sight of You)\ndelicate and precious [Life Hammer) and stripped\nsimplicity (the hook of Sea of Sound) and its\naccompanying aural diversions). The album doses\nwith the steel-woven whimsy of Sight of You, rerecorded from the Barging EP and the joyful sting of\nTime Thief.\nIf you only enjoy LPs which come to the point, stick\ngrimly to it for two sides and stop, you won't enjoy\nthis album.

    "content": "FeliX Staff Protocol\nNeil McCluskey has implied that he may wish to\nintroduce a staff protocol into IC Union. His mind is\nclearly at odds with the realities of Imperial College.\nHe says that other student unions have a staff\nprotocol. The University of London Union has such a rule, which states that no discussion of permanent\nstaff may take place. There is a good reason for this;\nthe law. ULU is not the legal employer of its\npermanent staff, the University is. This means that,\nsince the student union does not employee its staff\nit cannot pass comment upon them. This is not the\ncase at Imperial College. The Union employs its own\npermanent staff at IC. For Neil to be able to implement\na scheme like the one at ULU he would have to give\nup his status in law as the employer of the permanent\nstaff.\nThe reason Mr McCluskey wishes to produce such\na staff protocol, is to prevent FELIX reporting on the\nUnion's permanent staff. If FELIX is prevented from\nreporting on these staff, what right can we lay claim\nto when reporting on College staff and their actions?\nNeil's suggestion is just a vain attempt to gag FELIX.\nSometimes I wish that the people who wished they\nwere FELIX Editor would stand for the post in the first\nplace.\nThe NALGO members\nThe Union Office staff have now laid themselves open\nto comment by sending a statement to the UGM.

This is a clear\nsign of Ms Hardy-Smith trying to get her oar in where\nit is not needed. STOIC collected the message and\nbinned it. The un headed paper contained an unsigned\nstatement made on several people's behalf-it was\nan un statement, it was no more.

    "content": "More Asiansoc\nDear Dave,\nI suppose the letter concerning Asian Soc in last\nweek's FELIX asks for a response. Just so that you\ndon't have to dig out the issue, this is what Anil\nLoadwa wrote about Asian Society:\n'(...(Firstly the only reason Bhartendu set up an\nAsian Soc was because he knew no one would have\nelected him as President for Indian Soc. It was an ego\ntrip. The setting up was helped by 'contacts' eg\nformer India Soc president Kob and his dear friend\nWouter (OSC Chairman] who pushed the motion\nthrough the Union. (...)'\nI would like to reply to Mr Loadwa's letter with\nthese comments:\nIf someone has the enthusiasm and ability to set up\na new society and manages to collect 135 signatures,\nwhy should anyone object to the formation of this\nnew society?\nYours sincerely,\nWouter van Hulten, Overseas Students Officer.\nSorry\nDear Dave,\nWe were most concerned with the implication in\nyour article 'Chem Eng in disgrace' that the first year\nwere to blame for the disgraceful behaviour at the\nformal departmental dinner.\nTwenty-four out of seventy-five first years went to\nthe dinner, none of whom embarrassed the\ndepartment. (In fact, most of the trouble was confined\nto fourth years, postgraduates and academic staff.)\nAlso the clean-up bill was not the sensational \u00a35,000\nbut actually \u00a3100.\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to say\nhow disappointed we are that the lecturers felt that\nit was necessary to admonish us for the behaviour of\nothers. Although they may have been trying to ensure\nthat these scenes are not repeated in future years, the\nconduct of the first year at the dinner showed that\nreprimand was unnecessary.\nWe do not condone what happened that evening\nbut were concerned about the reputation of the First\nYear Chem Eng who will have to attend further formal\ndinners.\nYours sincerely,\nA J Marsh, S Brownina, G Marks, P Caldwell Dugald\nAgble, 1 Alam.\n'Toon tribute\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to FELIX for the first time to express\nmy thanks to you and several members of the FELIX\nteam for the support that you have given me\nthroughout my campaign for the Deputy President's post.\nI am especially grateful to Jeremy Burnell and Andy\nThompson, for the efforts put into helping me produce\nthe poster, which my friends still reckon suffered from\nthe fact that I was in it, and to yourself for the long\nhours and late nights.\nLet it now be recorded in the annals of ICU History\nthat I am the first candidate ever to be defeated by\na 'toon. One astute member of the electorate asked\nme who I most admired in the world. Well, put aside\nthe politicians, movie stars, businessmen and sex\nkittens, I can only be in awe of Jessica R., and I wish\nher all the best for the future.\nYours sincerely,\nBenjamin Turner.\nPage 14\nSquashed!\nDear Dave,\nA funny thing happened to me last week. I was told\nthat the Sports Centre was in dire financial straits and\ntherefore the Union Squash Club time would have to\nbe rather drastically reduced. These changes were\nrushed through a meeting of the South Ken Sports\nCommittee and are being implemented this week.\nNow the funny thing about this is that I'm captain\nof the Squash Club, and I wasn't informed of these\nchanges until after the events had taken place. No\ndiscussion, just a decree from the College authorities.\nThe changes are fairly extensive, probably won't work\nand are going to cause one hell of a pain in the arse\nto me as I try to explain to my members this lightning\ndecision. Sports Centre staff are as equally doubtful\nas me on the mechanics of the scheme.\nThe decision is quite indicative of the College\nauthorities' poor relations and communications with\nthe student body. No careers service, earmarking of\nHarlington Trust funds for a hall of residence,\nwhatever next, sale of the Union? or perhaps a knighthood for the Rector.\nCraig Robinson, Captain Squash Club.\nBigotry\nDear Dave,\nIt has come to my attention that there is a case of\ndiscrimination in this College. This may not be a surprise to the majority of the students in College but\nthe nature of it will shock many.\nAs a first year I am about to start on the futile search\nfor a room for next year that will not send me heavily\ninto the red and is less than fifty miles away, stupid\nI know.\n'Why don't you try for a re-app?', impossible as\nunlike most of the people who do get rooms as re-apps\nI spend some of my time working, not down the pub\nplying the sub-wardens with drinks.\nDuring my vain efforts to find somewhere that even\nclosely meets my needs I discovered an oasis in the\ndesert. Just as I feel that I have a small chance of\ngetting a place it is snatched away from me in a cruel\nvindictive way.\nThe place in question is a basement flat in Fisher\nHall. These flats have room for five or six people but\nthey are NOT reserved for re-apps from Fisher Hall.\nAs far as I am aware, please correct me if I am wrong,\nthey should thus be made equally accessible to all\nstudents without preference towards Fisher Hall\nresidents.\nUpon inquiring further I find that all the students in\nthe flats, almost without exception are indeed ex-Fisher Hall residents and that the only way of getting\na flat is to have 'friends' in the hall such as re-apps\nand sub-wardens.\nWithout friends in the hall I would never have\ndiscovered the existence of these flats and indeed\nmost students outside of the hall have no idea that\nthey exist. Even the method of applying for these flats\nis a secret kept by a selected few. They may as well\nnot exist for at least 90% of the student population.\nIt is thus my opinion that these rooms are not being\nmade freely and impartially available to all residents\nas they should be.\nThis is thus positive discrimination towards Fisher\nHall residents and as such it should be condemned.\nI would appreciate it if the Evelyn Gardens\nSuperintendent would tell students if these details,\nwhich were obtained from word of mouth, are true\nand what he will do about it.\nYours,\nName withheld by request.\nNo bullshit!\nDear FELIX,\nI am sure that I speak for all the candidates in the\nrecent sabbatical elections when I extend my thanks\nto the FELIX staff for their help over the last few\nweeks.\nRose, Andy and especially Dave have all worked\nextremely hard to produce the elections publicity in\naddition to their normal workload to produce FELIX.\nDespite this they have remained friendly and helpful\neven when we bothered them with irrelevancies at\nawkward times. Certainly Dave has gone out of his\nway to ensure that each candidate has had the best\npublicity possible.\nThanks,\nDougie.\nHostile union\nDear Dave,\nEvents last Friday and Monday have made me\nconcerned about the way some of the Union\nPermanent Staff present themselves to students.\nOn Friday I agreed to mail out the copies of FELIX\nwhich are sent to members of College's Governing\nBody, national newspapers and others. Because of a backlog of three weeks, there were about 300\nenvelopes.\nHaving borrowed the Union franking machine and\nwith the help of several members of the FELIX staff,\nI spent about two hours franking the envelopes; they\nwere then carried down to the post office on\nExhibition Road by two of the FELIX staff. The cost\nof the mailing was about \u00a360 and there was about\n\u00a315 credit left on the franking machine, which I returned to the Union office at about 5pm. Part of the job of the Union Assistant Administrator,\nMiss Michelle Began, is, I believe, to frank outgoing\npost on behalf of Union clubs, societies, etc. The\nunpaid and freely given efforts of the FELIX staff thus\nsaved her several hours of tedious work. On entering\nthe Union Office on Monday morning, I received a spate of abuse from both her and the Union\nAdministrator, Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith.\nWe were accused of using up all the credit on the\nfranking machine: is \u00a315 not enough to do the\nmajority, if not all, of the Union's post for one day?\nI know that a cheque had already been signed allowing\nmore credit to be put on the machine as soon as\nnecessary.\nMiss Began then asserted that the FELIX Editor\nshould take the machine to be refilled: 'He should take\nhis turn with the other sabbaticals; he's not pulling,\nhis weight,' she said. This is outrageous given that\nthe FELIX Editor has worked through the night twice\nin the past two weeks, has worked for the last three\nweekends (and many previous ones) and frequently\nworks until midnight or later during the week. I am\nsure the other sabbaticals work very hard, but do they\nconsistently have to work over 80 hours a week? I am certain that Miss Began does not.\nRecently one of the candidates for FELIX Editor\naccused the Union Print Unit of being 'hostile'. I think\nthis is a term which is far more appropriate for the\nUnion Office. Is it just FELIX Staff, or does everyone\nreceive the same miserable grudging reception? I hope\nnot, but I suspect it goes a long way towards\nexplaining the reputation ICU has for being\n'unfriendly'.\nLiz Warren\nFELIX Features Editor\nChem Eng 4\n\n"

    "content": "The War of the Roses\nFilm\nHow often do you see a film that totally redefines a term like swinging from the chandeliers? War Of The\nRoses is that sort of film. A lawyer (Danny DeVito)\nis talking to a client who is contemplating divorce. As\na warning he relates the tale of Oliver and Barbara\nRose, friends of his. They met at an auction, both\nbidding for the same object. Soon they were married.\nOliver peruses a successful career in law while Barbara\nbears the children and sets up a perfect home for her\nhusband. Unfortunately there is trouble in paradise.\nWhen the children leave home Barbara decides to set\nup a catering business of her own. Then when, by\nchance, she gets a brief glimpse of life without Oliver,\nshe decides she likes it\u2014and asks for a divorce. Then\nwhen neither will give up the perfect house, it turns\ninto a battleground...\nDirector DeVito has gathered together the\nRomancing the Stone team (himself, Michael Douglas,\nKathleen Turner) for this movie and without a doubt\nit was a good move. There is a chemistry between\nthe three that survives the transition into a totally\ndifferent set of characters. Douglas and Turner\nsuccessfully and convincingly portray the change in\nthe couple's attitude to one another, from being madly\nin love to madly in hate. The addition of the superb\nMarianne Sagebrecht [Bagdad Cafe, Rosalie Goes\nShopping) as the housekeeper was also an inspired\nchoice, although she is sadly underused in the film.\nThe Mis- nm,re\nunderstanding\nImH i Pi\nPlays where characters are employed to disseminate\nphilosophical and moral ideas can be profoundly\nstimulating and challenging but are often devoid of\nany 'conventional' form of entertainment. For those\nof us who go to the theatre to be entertained, two\nhours of Albert Camus' nihilist philosophy on stage,\nis not a mug of Earl Grey, milk, two sugars.\nIt's an interesting story though: a wealthy\nbusinessman returns to his mother's and sister's guest\nhouse after twenty years absence. Temporarily unable\nto reveal his identity he is murdered by them for his\nmoney. But then they find out...The cast are\ncompetent, if a little unimaginative and there are some\ninteresting lighting effects. So if you're fed up with\nAristotle and Descartes-try to understand this.\nThe Misunderstanding is currently playing at the\nGate Theatre, Notting Hill. Box office 229 7061.\nAdrian Pagan.\nPage 4\nThe plot starts off as a fairly normal love story\nbefore making a leap into a bizarre battle between the\ncouple-a surrealistic comedic version of The Shining,\nbut with the pair of them crazy. This suits DeVito's unusual and imaginative directional style down to the\nground, with camera angles and inter cut scenes used\nto grotesque comic effect. Somehow, though, he\nmanages to make the frankly unbelievable situations\nGlory\nDon't you hate film promoters? They're pushing this\nfilm as a star vehicle for Matthew Broderick. All right\nhe plays an important role in the film but there is far\nmore to it than that. Set during the American Civil\nWar, it tells of the raising of the first black regiment\nto fight for the north. They were led by Colonel Robert\nShaw, a white and a survivor of the battle of Antinam,\nwhen 40,000 people were killed in five hours\n(compared to 50,000 americans during the whole of\nVietnam). Eager to go into combat against the\nsoutherners, they first have to combat prejudice\namongst the higher ranking members of the Northern\narmy.\nWith 1,000 men in the 54th the only way the\nproducers could portray their struggles was to use a small group of slightly stereotyped men to represent\nthe whole. Most notable of these are Trip, a runaway\nslave, and Rawlins, a grave digger turned sergeant-major.' Trip, played by Denzel Washington [Cry\nFreedom), has suffered so much from racism that he\nhimself has become racist, hating everyone with a white skin. Rawlins, played by Morgan Freeman\n(Driving Miss Daisy), is a voice of wisdom amongst\nthe hot-headed impetuosity of the rest of the men.\nUnder Rawlins guidance Trip learns to control and use\nhis aggression.\nThe part of Col. Shaw is an unusual one for\nBroderick, but one he handles well, showing the\ncolonel's transition from an introverted and naive\nyoung man to a battle hardened (but still idealistic)\nleader of men. Occasionally he is called upon to deliver\nlines which could easily sound corny, but which he\nmanages to deal with remarkably well. He is showing\nsigns of maturing into a fine actor.\nThe photography is often superb, many scenes\nsticking vividly in one's mind long after the film has\nfinished. It is particularly effective during the battle\nthat occur credible.\nA literal battle of the sexes that also looks at\nmarriage and divorce, while steering clear and\noccasionally parodying clich es, this is an excellent\nfilm. Very funny and very black it is well worth seeing,\njust don't take your boyfriend/girlfriend.\nAdam T. Film\nscenes, showing the true horror of war, with many\nhorrific, but brief, scenes of death and injury. The film\nis less about war though, than about a group of\npeople's struggle to achieve the respect that they are\nentitled to. Their final, almost pointless sacrifice and\nthe eventual good that comes of it is very moving.\nGlory is a remarkably emotional film, and one that\ninvolves the viewer totally. Its message is still relevant\nas the battle against prejudice these men were fighting\nhas not yet been won.\nAdam T. "

Dylan James, proposed by\nAshley Unitt, was defeated by new\nelection for the post of External Affairs\nOfficer.

Nicholas Marley as House\nCommittee Chairman, Suzanne Ahmet as\nU GM Chairman, Caroline Cruttwell as\nICCAG Chairman and Steve Farrant as\nRag Chairman. No nominations were\nreceived for the posts of Internal Services\nOfficer, Academic Affairs Officer or\nWelfare Officer.

He said that if anyone had\nsuggestions for how they felt the money\ncould be spent, he would like to hear from\nthem as soon as possible.\nDuring the meeting, the Union\nHonorary Secretary, Fiona Nicholas, read\na statement issued by the Union Permanent\nStaff who are members of the National\nAssociation of Local Government\nOfficials (NALGO).

    "content": "Welfare reply\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to you regarding Dylan James's letter\nwhich appeared two weeks ago in FELIX (issue 860,\nFebruary 23) on the subject of the Poll Tax.\nWhilst I am pleased that students are reading the\narticles and handouts I produce, I am also concerned\nthat some, like Mr James, are still confused about\nexactly what the Poll Tax will mean for them. I am\nalso concerned that Mr James has misused\ninformation available in the Welfare Office to suit his\nargument.\nI therefore feel it is essential that the following\npoints are made:\n1.1 have never stated 'that the typical student pays\n\u00a35.25 in rates on \u00a350.00 rent per week'. The source\nof this piece of misinformation I assume came from\nmy handout on Housing Benefits in which I used an\nexample to show how Housing Benefit is worked out.\nIn this example the rent was given as \u00a350.00 of which\n\u00a35.25 per week is rates. The words 'typical student'\ndo not appear in this handout. In fact in my experience\nmany students at present pay more than \u00a350.00 per\nweek inclusive rent.\n2. Mr James has correctly calculated that \u00a35.25 per\nweek paid during the academic year comes to\n\u00a3199.50. This is clearly a lot more than the student\nPoll Tax bill for LB. Westminster-\u00a339.00 or R.B. Kensington & Chelsea-\u00a375.00. However he has\noverlooked three very important factors:\nDear Dave,\nAfter all the recent publicity concerning Harlington\nand the Gravel Fund, I feel it is time to explain the\nposition of the Hockey Club-undoubtedly the most\naffected by the works.\nI was not at Imperial when the gravel extraction\nstarted, but I am led to understand that the hockey\npitches were some of the best around at the time.\nIndeed, when I arrived there were three very good\ngrass pitches. This was for three IC teams and three\nCCU teams. The deal with Streeters, the gravel\ncontractors, was that a substantial area of the\nHarlington grounds be relaid for the start of this\nseason. This was despite representation from the\nACC, and even the grounds men saying to the\ncontrary. It was mid-August when, surprise, surprise,\nthe people in charge of the relaying cottoned on to\nthe fact that what they had produced, was not a smooth surface suitable for student sport, but a cabbage patch, and a very poor cabbage patch at that.\nSo, at this time, six weeks before the start of term,\nthe Hockey Club was told that we had only one pitch,\nand that we would have to find alternative grounds.\nFor anyone that doesn't know, six weeks is not very\nlong to find pitches to play three or four matches on\nevery Wednesday and Saturday. Luckily we booked\nsome and so this season we have managed, however\nfor next season, we have made no bookings, foolishly\nbelieving that finally we were going to receive our own\nastroturf. Demand for artificial pitches is huge, and\nat present, we have not been able to get bookings,\neven on the pitches we are currently using.\n\u2022 Many students are going to find it difficult to get\nlandlords to reduce rents from 1.4.90 (I shall expand\na little on this in point 3).\n\u2022 The 1988 Housing Act has meant that the majority\nof students now have Assured Shorthold Tenancies\nfor which the landlord can charge a 'market rent'. So\neven if the landlord reduces the rent from April he will\nbe able to increase it again when the tenancy ends.\nSo for example, a student paying \u00a350.00 per week\nincluding rates could well be paying \u00a350.00 and above\nper week excluding rates in his next accommodation.\n\u2022 I agree that L.B. Westminster's Poll Tax for students\nis low but how many students can afford\nWestminster's rents? A large number of students only\nget one year in an IC hall of residence where the cost\nis comparatively low compared with private sector\nrents and allowing for possible travelling expenses.\nDuring next term 1st and 2nd year students will be\nhunting for the cheapest suitable accommodation\nthey can find because student loans are coming in and\nHousing Benefit is going. This cheaper\naccommodation is likely to be in higher Poll Tax areas.\nDo I hear 'swings and roundabouts'?\n3. Mr James also argues that ICU should be telling\nstudents how to use the law in order to get landlords\nto reduce their rents from 1.4.90. However there is\nno provision in the Community Charge Regulations\nthat require landlords to reduce rents. In Scotland\nlandlords have taken advantage of this and many\nSo, the situation we have is this: there will be one\npitch at Harlington, little or no astroturf bookings, and\nup to six teams to play at once. This will have far\nreaching consequences for the Hockey Club. The\nladies have just been elected to a Saturday league,\nafter a long struggle for recognition, and without home\npitches they face the very real possibility of expulsion\nwithout having played a match. During UAU fixtures\nfive teams play at home on the same day, and without\nfacilities the same fate may face us in this\ncompetition, all this after such success at getting a team to the semi-final.\nThe success and expansion of the Club in the last\nthree years seems set to be dramatically reversed if\nthe astroturf pitch is not laid this summer. We all feel\nthat College is right in saying that \u00a3475,000 is too\nmuch to pay for one pitch, but if they had set about\nspecifying realistic requirements for this pitch (the two\npitches in Battersea Park, which are excellent cost\nless than \u00a314 million together), then this current delay\nwould not have occurred, and the Hockey Club would\nbe looking forward to further expansion and success\nin the future. As it looks at the moment, many of the\nmembers will have to play for other clubs, or simply\ndiscontinue playing altogether. This would be a great\nshame for hockey and athletics at Imperial, and I ask\nthe powers that be to consider this plight we are faced\nwith when they decide to, or not to proceed with, the\nastroturf pitch.\nYours sincerely,\nColin Wright, Hockey Club Captain.\ntenants have lost out as are s ut. Other existing\nlegislation can help tenants to reduce rents but the\nprocess has many pitfalls. Anyone who wants to\npursue this should seek advice. Also it is important\nto remember that the reduction will only apply up to\nthe end of the current tenancy.\n4. Finally Mr James along with all other students\nshould remember that they will not be students\nforever. Final year students will become liable for the\nfull Poll Tax when they leave College at the end of\nJune.\nSo do students gain from the Poll Tax? I will leave that\nquestion to individual students to answer for\nthemselves. If anyone would like any further\ninformation and advice the Welfare Office is open for\n'typical students' and others from 12.30-5.30pm Monday to Friday.\nYours,\nYve Posner, ICU Welfare Adviser.\nP.S. In case anyone is still wondering-yes, I am\nanti-poll tax. However as a Welfare Adviser I do not\nadvise students to break the law. Anyone who wants\nto resist the Poll Tax should join their local anti-Poll\nTax group.\nP.P. S. The next time someone rips my posters off\na display board I won't be responsible for their\nwelfare!\nThanks Mrs T Dear Dave,\nFrom the man who brought you 'Jesus voted Tory'\nwe now have the assertion that students will actually\ngain from the Poll Tax. Mr James has struck again.\nI don't know how accurate the figure of \u00a35.25 rates\na week for the average student, but I pay something\nmore like \u00a31.25 a week in rates in a \u00a345 bill. Now I must admit that I do live in Westminster, so my \u00a339\na year would seem at first sight a good deal. But it\nmust be remembered that Westminster is a seat the\nConservatives are in grave danger of losing at the next\nelection. So whoever wins the seat, I think we can\nlook forward to this \u00a339 not staying so low.\n'How can anyone complain that students are losing\nout?' asks Mr James. This is how-as from April this\nyear there will be no Housing Benefit, so this means\nat least \u00a320 a week down the drain for a good number\nof students. And does anybody seriously believe that\nmore than a handful of landlords will actually decrease\ntheir rents because they do not have to pay rates? I would suggest that with housing becoming even more\ndifficult to find, rents will actually rise.\nLet's all thank Mrs T for...urn, er...yes.\nJohn Mitchell, Maths 2.\nTaking the Ritz\nDear Dave,\nThank you for expressing an interest in ordering\n'several thousand' Vote Ritsperis stickers (FELIX\n863).

    "content": "Book\nAll the Wrong Places\nby James Fenton\nThe nac k of becoming a journalist; in particular a foreign correspondent covering the most turbulent\ncountries in the world is to let events flow over you\nand then pick out the choicest morsels to turn into\nyour stories.\nJames Fenton has been covering turbulent events\nin the world for over twenty years, revolutions both\nviolent and political have all been revealed to the\nworld.\nHe is very much an individual, rather than going with\nthe crowd he is prepared to go it alone, find his own\nstories, make his own stories come alive. This does\ntend to lead him into what can only be described as\ninteresting situations. Things like hitching a lift on the\nfirst tank to storm the palace in Saigon, or enter\nMarcos' personal suit only minutes after the dictator\nhas fled, all these things add up to a slightly\ndangerous, almost precarious life. One thing is for\ncertain, life is never dull.\nAsia has always been a place of extremes, wealth\nand poverty, dominance and subversion, they have\nall played their part in changing the face of a continent. Democracy is always portrayed as the\nsolution to all the evils of dictators but it is an\nunnatural medicine for south east Asia. In this part of\nthe world they have known nothing but dictators,\nmonarchies or anarchy, and little if anything has\nchanged in the last few decades.\nThe book is a series of accounts portraying the\npersonal effects of revolt; from Vietnam to\nKampuchea, the Philippines to Korea, and how the\nideas of the few effect the masses that have very little\nsay in what happens.\nEach story shows a different side of the coin, the\ndecadence that was overthrown in Korea, the brutality\nand terrorism in Kampuchea and foreign empire\nbuilding that went wrong in Vietnam. They are well\nwritten and interesting, producing a clearer picture of\nthe sequence of events than you could from the bits\nand pieces that get churned up at every opportunity\nin history programmes\nThe book is written in an informal and relaxed style,\nbut you do need to have a basic idea of the events\nas he does not stop and explain the background to the\nevents that he chronicles, so brush up on your\ntwentieth century history become reading this book.\nPerhaps the best reason to by the book, apart from\nthe obvious requirements of being enjoyable, is that\nit is unbiased and truthful.\nFor this reason I can recommend this book as a good\nfactual read that is light and interesting and well worth\nthe effort.\nIan Hodge.\nFilm\nShadow\nMakers\nWhat does Fat Man and Little Boy mean to you? To\nmost of America apparently it was taken for the name\nof a duo comedy film. They were probably rather\nsurprised to discover that it was all about the\nconstruction of the first two atomic bombs. To\nprevent the same thing happening here it has been\nrenamed Shadow Makers.\nGeneral Leslie R. Groves (Paul Newman) was\nresponsible for building the pentagon. He has now\nbeen assigned to a different task\u2014the construction\nof an atomic bomb. He assembles a team of America's greatest minds led by J. Robert Oppenheimer (Dwight\nSchultz, best known as Mad Murdoch from the ATeam, but un recognisable), who set to work on the\ndevice. The General convinces them that they are\nworking to beat Germany to the bomb. When he\neventually discovers that The Nazis are not working\non the bomb, he hides this from them. Victory in\nEurope is declared, but still work progresses. Slowly,\nthough, discontent grows among the scientists.\nThis is not a purely factual retelling of the events\nleading up to the nuclear attacks on Japan, as certain\nsections have been fictionalised. Most noticeable of\nthese is the horrific death of one of the team when\nhe is subjected to a fatal dose of radiation. Still the\nmajority is based in fact, and it should make for a gripping tale.\nMost of the drama arises from conflict. Principally\nthis involves disagreements between the military\n(Groves) and the scientists (Oppenheimer) as well as\nthe internal struggle between the scientists'\nconsciences and their desire to harness the basic\npower of creation. A perfunctory love interest is\nintroduced for the scientist doomed to die of radiation\npoisoning, but her sole purpose seems only to be\nmaking his death seem more tragic. We also see\nOppenheimer forced into a dilemma over his\nmistress-a rather crude symbol for the abandoning\nof his humanity perhaps?\nIt has to be said that for most of the film one cares\nlittle about what is going on. It is only in the last half\nhour or so that the horror of the bomb is shown at\nall. There are two eerie and frightening scenes at the\nfirst testing of the bomb, as well as the oft mentioned\nradiation death to convey the strongly anti-nuclear\nstance of the film. This along with some moral ising about life and nature is all there is to commend a rather\nboring film, which could have been a dark warning\nagainst the terminal nuclear path humanity has taken.\nAdam T. Page 3\nPlaff!\nFilm\nPlaff! is a Cuban comedy about throwing eggs; pla ff being the Cuban word for 'Splat'. The story is a fairly\nstraightforward one about a rotund, middle-aged\nhousewife, Concha, who is the target for the\naforementioned eggs. This distresses her somewhat\nbecause the eggs are a bad omen in Santeria, the\nunofficial afro-based religion of Cuba. Whoever is\nthrowing the eggs obviously wants Concha out of her\nhouse, the question is who is it? The suspects are\nnumerous, including a neighbour who had an affair\nwith Concha's late husband, Thomas, Concha's surprisingly persist ant admirer and Cartia, who is\nmarried to Concha's son Jose Ramon and to whom\nConcha has taken an avid dislike. Just as Concha\nthinks she has worked out who it is and accuses them,\nanother egg is thrown and eventually it all becomes\ntoo much for her.\nMuch of the humour in this film centres around\nrather bad cinematic gags such as missed cues, sound\nproblems, atrocious editing and the film starts in the\nsecond reel, going back to the first at the end. None\nof this works very effectively especially since it is easy\nto imagine a lot of Cuban cinema being genuinely like\nthat. There is also quite a bit of slapstick comedy such\nas inappropriately placed filing cabin ents which\neveryone walks into and of course the eggs which is\neither hilariously funny or embarrassingly juvenile\ndepending on your taste in comedy.\nPerhaps the most effective aspect of the film is the\nway in which it s at irises everything: religion,\nbureaucracy, family relationships and life in general.\nOne amusing episode involves Clarita who is a chemical engineer. She has discovered how to make\na polymer out of pig excrement and egg white which\nabsorbs precious metals exclusively from sea water.\nShe is prevented from developing it by government\nbureaucrats, that is, until an emotional outburst on\ntelevision by her husband, Jose, who is a baseball\nstar.\nI would describe this film as light rather than funny\nalthough if you happen to be Cuban it is probably a lot more amusing. Unless you understand the ins and\nouts of Cuban life much of the satire is likely to be\nlost. Plaff! runs for three weeks at the ICA Cinema\nas part of a season of films and talks celebrating the\nwork of black comics, comedy writers and film\nmakers.\nLiz.\n\n"

    "content": "Liz Warren interviews Angus Fraser, Managing Director of IC. As the man whose decisions affect us all,\nhe wants...\nValue for money\nThe new College Managing Director, Angus Fraser,\ndominates any company he is in. Well over six foot\ntall, Cambridge educated and a graduate of the\nEuropean Institute of Business Administration\n(INSEAD) at Fontainbleau, he has a distinguished\ncareer in international business behind him. His work\nhas taken him to many exotic countries and he has\nlived in East and West Africa, France and Malaysia.\nNow, he has left the world of corporate boardrooms\nto deal with the equally complex problems of\nadministering Imperial College. He studied History and\nModern Languages for his degree before taking the\ncourse at INSEAD.\nHe sees his role at Imperial as 'very much as it was\nunder the College secretary. The issues haven't changed simply by virtue of my appointment.' He feels\nthat 'what has changed or appears to have changed\nis that, by virtue of coming out of a different kind of\nenvironment to do the job, the way I go about tackling\nfairly well identified issues is different'.\nHe says 'the administrative side of College, in crude\nterms, is my main sphere of interest.' This includes\nthe self financing activities, such as residences and\nrefectories. The College now has a Business Manager,\nTom Stevens, to take charge of these areas and\ndevelop them. Angus is looking forward to 'improving\namenities and improving services, both for external\nand internal users.\nHe admits that the College is 'not in a strong\nfinancial position as things stand today', and he sees\none of his main tasks as 'improving the underlying\nfinancial position of the college. We balance our\nbooks, but in balancing them we are usually obliged\nPage 8\nto make certain sacrifices from year to year and we\ndon't spend as much as we want or ought to spend\non things that matter: buildings or student\naccommodation. You can't go on doing that\nindefinitely.'\nHe added that 'while on the face of it we appear\nto be balancing our books, we need to make it clear\nto those who are in a position to fund universities that\nit is at a cost,' He stressed that the College must\n'ensure that where it is spending money it is getting\nthe best possible value for money.' 'That goes back\nto how we control our expenditure,' he said.\nHe explained that there were several ways in which\nhe was hoping to improve the College finances: 'We\ncan generate income from the services and amenities\nside and through the use of college facilities by\ninstitutions and companies. We can realise the value\nof a number of assets that we perhaps do not use as\neffectively or efficiently as we might, by disposing of\nthem or letting them out. Then we can raise funds\nexternally from those people who have funds available\nfor endowment or sponsorship for individual projects\nor indeed general endowment. Obviously the less\nstrings that are attached, the better from our point.'\nHe agreed that College had probably employed him\nbecause his experience would help him to put the\nCollege on a better footing. 'Closely allied to that is\nthat the environment in which we are increasingly\nhaving to work is becoming more competitive. That\nis both a function of government policy, where we are\nbeing required in the future to bid for students in a commercial way, and also because it is an increasingly\ncompetitive environment anyway. We need to\ncompete in the way that we do our business as a whole, the way we offer the service that we do. This\ncovers everything from the kind of accommodation\nwe offer the students to attract them, to every area\nwe are involved in. That's the kind of environment I am well acquainted with; I think it's relevant and\nbecoming increasingly so.'\nDescribing what had attracted him to Imperial, he\nexplained that since January last year, he had 'had\nsome involvement with a company which was\noriginally sprung out of the Mech Eng department. So\nI wasn't completely ignorant of the college by any\nmeans. When the opportunity came up,and having\ndecided to change course and do something\ncompletely new, this seemed to fit the bill in an\nunexpectedly interesting and exciting way.'\nHe acknowledged that, although the job is, on the\nsurface, a change from his previous work, he 'hadn't felt at all like a fish out of water: the issues are all so\nfamiliar. The thing which is different is the way in\nwhich the College runs itself. Talking about how the\nmove fitted in with his overall career pattern, he said,\n'I 've always felt one only gets very few opportunities\nin a career and if you add up the opportunities to\nchange course and do something new and exciting its\na handful, if you're lucky. I can count the ones I 've\nhad on one hand. When they come up, they come up\nin a totally unexpected way and they hit you as\nopportunities. This one hit me as a real opportunity\nto change course and it was attractive on that\naccount.'\nWith a gap of almost eighteen months between his\nprevious job and his employment in College, he\nexplained that 'having been abroad so much I hadn't got all that much exposure to opportunities in the UK,\nI recognised that I needed some time to look at\nopportunities and to meet a lot of people, so I spent\nthe initial period going round meeting a lot of people\nand finding out what was going on. I also built up a number of interests as a self-employed director and\nconsultant. Over half of that time I was 110 percent\nover employed working on various company accounts,\nsuch as the company with connections with the Mech\nEng department. It was a very enjoyable and\ninteresting 18 months if a little uncertain.' He is still\ninvolved with several of the companies but has 'given\nup half of my outside involvements. There weren't enough hours in the night to do the full job and do all\nthat one could expect to do on my other interests.'\nHe described one of his main areas of\npreoccupation: 'getting value for money where we\nspend it. Part of that is about control of systems so\nthat we don't make mistakes in the way we operate\nand people don't have to do things three times: they\ncan do them once and get it right.' Another area which\nhe feels is important 'is that, having achieved\nexcellence and having as good a reputation as we\nhave in academic terms for teaching and research, the\nmaintenance and enhancement of that reputation will\nbecome increasingly dependant upon every other\naspect of the institution working to the same kind of\nhigh standards.'\nHe pointed out that, 'there are areas which work\nwell outside the academic area and there are areas\nwhich do not work as well as they should or could.\nThat isn't on account of a lack of will or concern,\nbecause I think there's a great deal of commitment,\nbut because the way we are currently split up in\n\n"

    "content": "Rugby Gutteridge Cup Final\nOn a wet, blustery Sunday IC defeated St Thomas's Hospital in the final of the Gutteridge Cup. A knockout competition annually contested by all London\ncolleges and hospitals (bar one-St Mary's of\ncourse). IC last winners in 1986, already beating the\nholders, Kings College on the way to the final.\nObviously Kings felt pretty displeased and regretfully\nthe Cup was not returned in time for presentation at\nthe final.\nA strong IC team took to the field at Motspur Park\nto boisterous support from over 100 IC supporters.\nImmediately on the kick off IC scored a sensational\ntry. Left wing Dave Fleming going over in the corner\nafter speedy ruc king from the pack and swift handling\nin the backs creating the overlap. This was to set the\npace of the game. With everything at stake, both\nteams playing hard, fast rugby this was going to form\na quiet clash.\nIC needed as many points on the board as possible\nwith the strong wind advantage in the first half, and\ndidn't the boys do well?\nThomas's experienced backs were denied\npossession as the IC forwards played sensationally.\nSupporting one another all round the field, almost\ncertainly first to every breakdown and cleaning up at\nthe line out. What is normally a straightforward ball\nwinning procedure, even the scrum became an IC\nmonopoly. All eight forwards were superb, playing like\nmen possessed. Of these Pete Drew and John Fowler\nwere outstanding.\nBall was provided so clinically and with such ease,\nscrum-half Simon Bicknell could completely control\nthe game. Thomas's didn't do themselves any justice\neven with their hooker being sent off for unlawful use\nof his fist-what a silly billy.\nInevitably IC continued to put the points on. A forward drive at a five yard scrum gave flanker Brian\nGreensmith an easy try. Quick thinking from Simon\nBicknell gave Dave Fleming a second try, after running\na short penalty. Captain Rich Walters also putting over\na few kicks to give IC a lead of 18-0 at half time.\n3\nWith the wind strength increasing in the second\nhalf, Thomas's never looked liked scoring a try. Their\nonly scores coming from two short penalties. IC\ncontinued their style of play, grand sweeping\nmovements up field, knocking back the opposition\nplayers. Nearing the end, Thomas's heads began to\ndrop, with superior fitness and an insatiable hunger,\nIC ran in two further tries. Dave Felming getting a third\nand the last for Fullback J F Lucas. With these the\npowerful chant of 'IC-IC booming from the\ngrandstand.\nThe IC players punching the air with delight on the\nshrill of the final whistle, they ran out resounding\nwinners 26-6. All players performed superbly and\nFootball Rifle\nindividual performances would be hard to pick out.\nHowever, the majority of observers agreed scrum half Simon Bicknell was man of the match. Now we had\nall afternoon and evening to get completely pissed.\nThanks to everyone for support on the day. A day to\nremember!\nCITY & GUILDS COLLEGE\nMAY BALL1990 Friday 11th May\n7.30pm for 8.00pm at the FORUM HOTEL,\nCromwell Road\nTickets: \u00a347 per double, now available\nfrom Guilds Office\nincludes:\n+magician -k disco k cocktails t dinner Sailing\nSt Georges-0 IC 1 sts \u2014 3\nAfrican artistry, Brazilian brilliance and Canadian class\nproved to be the ingredients that spiced up this dull\nencounter as IC's international contingent provided\nthe goals that completed a comprehensive rout of\nGeorges.\nDespite the blustery conditions IC were never going\nto be blown off course, taking the lead as early as the\nfifth minute through Femi Omotoyo's only useful\ncontribution to the game, a well-placed low shot. It\nwould have been two a few minutes later after Pip\nPeel won and then missed a penalty.\nMeanwhile back at the other end new boys Mike\nWilkes and Paul Nelson were conf indent ly coping with\nwhat little Georges attempted to throw at them, aided\nof course by ever present Chris Burton and Tim Fisher.\nTwo superb goals at the end of the first half clinched\nthe game for IC, first Toni de Lyon rifled home a shot\nthat the keeper didn't even bother diving for and then\nPat Fancott (the biggest thing to come out of Canada\nsince John Candy) with his back to the goal and the\nkeeper clawing all over him produced a delightfully\ncheeky overhead kick that sneaked in at the post. The\nsecond half was so unbelievably dull that a certain\ngoalkeeper spent the whole time practising his Jane\nFonda workout. The only points of note were a Toni\nde Lyon shot against the post and a Pip Peel effort\ndisallowed because Mr Omotoga had forgotten to get\nback on side. This week we would like to highlight one of the\ngreatest, most useful members of our rifle team. This\ngenius, showing skill rarely seen outside the Olympic\ncircuit, has managed to get the entire team\ndisqualified from the BUSF 'top twenty' team rifle\ncompetition.\nHow, you may wonder, did he managed to perform\nthis feat? It was surprisingly simple, he shot for both\nImperial College and the University of London 'A' team\n(without telling us), which could have caused\nproblems if both teams had made it to the final!\nSo, to overcome this difficulty, the organisers\ndecided, in a fit of rage, to disqualify us, but not UL\nas 'university teams take precedence over college\nteams'.\nYou may question yourself: Who is this superhero,\nthis Demi-God, this giant amongst marksmen, this tool\namongst adjustable spanners with special ratchet\nattachments, this complete and utter dork?\nHis name is MR SIMON CANE (MRE 1). If you see\nthis fine gentleman please be sure to call him by his\nnew title: Mr Spoons.\nDespite the efforts of the above mentioned genius\nwe are still able to compete in the BUSF individual\ncompetition, in which we are currently faring quite\nwell although our final positions won't be known until\nthe end of the competition.\nHaving repaired boats damaged by last weekend's high winds, thanks to the heroic efforts of Henry\nNebrensky the bosun, Imperial once again took to the\nwater.\nThe first two races were Imperial 1sts versus\nEyesores (an old boys team) and the superior\nexperience of the old boys soon showed. The first race\nwas won by the old boys by some sneaky tactics-namely pinching the best boats. In the second race\ncertain members of the old boys decided to show\nImperial 1 sts how it was done, capsizing before the\nstart and failing to get a good start. This led to a slightly better result for the first with a close win. The\nold boys then really started showing off with the most\nspectacular capsize of the day.\nAfter lunch Imperial 2nds then took on the old boys,\nlosing both races.\nTo even things out the 1 sts, 2nds and old boys were\nthen mixed up and several races run with these mixed\nteams.\nAll in all IC learnt a lot from the old boys, mainly\nhow to capsize.\nPage 7\n\n"
