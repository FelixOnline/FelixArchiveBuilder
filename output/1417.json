Nice sunglasses, a change to the ususal nerdy specs\nWe all like a bit of live action, so this week, we deliver Hot\nChip, Goldfrapp and Ani DiFranco for your pleasure\nHot Chip are a brainy electro-pop\nquintet, with four out of the five members being Oxbridge graduates. They\nhave been on the scene for a while now,\nformed in 2000 and now three albums\ndown the line, they are on the road\nagain, touring along the country and\nshowing that you can be both intelligent and play equally good music.\nIt was almost midnight before these\nguys emerged onstage. We were presented with a bizarre circus figure\nwho appeared in front of our eyes, a\nsore sight indeed. This could be noone but Alexis Taylor, the frontman of\nHot Chip, wearing his trademark ner-dish spectacles and sporting a rather\nin-your-face garishly-coloured robe\nwhich, thank goodness, he shed off\nlater on in the show to reveal more acceptable and less alarming stage-wear\nconsisting of plain white overalls.\nIt was inevitable that the anthemic\n\u2018Over and Over\u2019 was going to be on the\necstatic agenda for this cracking live\nset. The crowd reached their climax\nof the evening for sure on this wild,\nextreme energy bulldozer. Cacophony\nreigned recklessly, whilst adrenaline\npulsed through our veins as the flashing lights lit up the entire stage in a epi-leptic, chaotic demeanour.\n\u2018Ready For the Floor\u2019 was also on the\nbill. If you haven\u2019t checked out the vid-eo, well, you are missing out on something that is just beyond strange, with\nfalse teeth, weird women that appear\nto have been cut half due to the clear\nchoice of backdrop as well guys trying\nto dodge sticks that poke out at them.\nCrazy layout, crazy costumes and crazy colours. Completely bonkers. It\u2019s all\nin there.\nAnother prominent crowd-pleaser\nwas definitely one of the highlights\nof the show- \u2018And I Was A Boy From\nSchool.\u2019 This swoonsome song has a\nfantastically gripping tune which is\nmelancholy in sound yet simultaneously catchy and even at times joyous and\nhopeful. The amalgamation of Taylor\u2019s\nsomewhat poignant vocals with Goddard\u2019s baritone in this tune lead to an\noddly touching effect. The strong pulse\nthat ran through this number is again\nhighly hypnotic; the texture builds up\nas more instruments are added layer by\nlayer before the vocals kicks in. Teasing\nand wetting our appetites for sure. The\nchorus had the entire Brixton crowd\nsinging \u2018We try but we don\u2019t belong.\u2019\nIt is safe to say that Hot Chip are no\nlonger outcasts in life now that they\u2019ve\ngained wide recognition and success\nacross the UK as well as most of the\nglobe and are reaching more and more\nnew audiences by the day.\nAmongst the tracks that they played\nthat night included their new song, \u2018Alley Cats\u2019, a soulful, slowish, euphonic\nnumber,atracklikelytofeatureontheir\nforthcoming fourth album, which they\nplan to record soon. What Hot Chip\ndoes best is texture and good melodies\nand this song epitomises both key as-pects. Likewise we were delighted by\nanother slower track: the ambiguously\ntitled \u2018Playboy.\u2019 Do the five of them look\nlike playboys? We don\u2019t think so. They\nshould just stick to their music for the\ntime being.\n\u2018One Pure Thought\u2019 was dominated\nby the repeating mantra \u2013 \u2018I won\u2019t be\non my way\u2019 with dynamic beats and a\nconfusing mesh of electronic sounds\nproviding a rich, polyphonic-textured,\nlively soundscape.\nThe band showed off their repertoire of stuff with \u2018My Piano,\u2019 an upbeat\nslinky number heavy on the synthesizers and keyboards with short bursts of\npiano chord stabs to amplify the jilting rhythm. \u2018No Fit State\u2019 taken from\ntheir second album \u2018The Warning\u2019 was\na classic belter-\u2018We caught the fire but\nthe body escaped/\nLove other people but I don\u2019t know\ntheir names.\u2019 What peculiar lyrics,\nringing of some truth though.\nThe show was not complete without a spectacular combination of laser\nbeams and dramatic use of glittering disco lighting which tantalisingly\nconveyed the hectically exhilarating\natmosphere.\nThe band finished their set with\ntheir fiendishly compelling, mellow\nversion of Prince\u2019s classic \u2018Nothing\nCompares 2 U.\u2019 Well, for that magical\nepoch, nothing could have compared\nto Hot Chip and their maverick musical gifts.\nThe show was overwhelmed with the\neuphoric atmosphere, compounded\nby the release of a dozen or so enormous balloons into the buzzing crowd\ntowards the end of the set. The eager\ncrowd jumped up like a bunch of five\nyear-olds fighting for lollipops, everyone was reaching into the air, either\nto the music or lured by these crazy\nfloating beauties. With some luck and\nmaybe some tall genes, we got to be little kiddies again, happily playing in the\nplayground that was Brixton. A fabulous show that thoroughly entertained\nwith the invigorating energy and infectious enthusiasm that exuded from the\nband.\nTop notch action from these Oxbridge alumni. Boffins they may be,\nbut they sure can churn out some decent original stuff, doing it with style.\nThe fabulously charming Forum used\nto be a cinema, built in the 1930\u2019s, but\nhas been rendered as a considerably\ngrandiose musical venue in the last fifteen years or so. The powerful yet intimate stage has been testament to many\nwell-established artists strutting their\nstuff on stage, with the likes of Jamiroquai, Robbie Williams, Travis and Van\nMorrison on the performance bill. Following this tradition of having a highly\ntalented line-up, this time around with\nAni DiFranco, we could expect nothing but the same electric, intimate and\nintense aura all around. Looking in\neither direction, we were treated with\nthe lavish architecture and d\u00e9cor that\ncomplemented the intricate lighting,\nthe stage that was bathed in beautiful\nblue hues that sent out a serene seemingly mysterious vibe, a premonition\nfor the startling performance that was\nto follow.\nThe turnout was to be expected,\nthere were an eclectic bunch of people\nof all ages and of both genders, which\ncomes not so much as a surprise really\nas DiFranco has such a wide diversity\nof fans with her music crossing many\ngenres. No doubt there are legions of\nfans across the globe, some liking her\nfolky style, others maybe the rocky influence or even the jazzy feel that she\nincorporates into her music. It\u2019s terribly hard to pigeon-hole her as being of\nany particular genre, so with DiFranco,\nyou get variety, and that is what makes\nher stand out and probably the key to\nher success in carrying on being well\nreceived for two decades now. An incredible woman who knows how to\ncapture and recapture audiences again\nand again.\nBefore DiFranco came on stage, the\nhum of expectation was in the air, the\ncrowd having been treated to the fantastically ferocious Hamell on Trial\nand the delicate folk-acoustic set by\nAnais Mitchell.\nDiFranco certainly can have her pick\nwhen it comes to doing live shows,\nwith a twenty year career to look back\non and seventeen studio albums in the\nbag, the possibilities for the set-list are\ncountless, so most likely, she played\nwhat took her fancy that night and\nwent for it with much passion, fire and\nmaybe a little tenderness in some of the\nslower, more soulful tracks. No matter\nwhat, the adoring fans would certainly\nnot hold a grudge against her for not\nplaying their favourites because, with\nsuch a collection, you could not miss\nout on something that you loved.\nAni Difranco is someone who is not\nafraid of speaking out. Being someone who feels strongly about politics,\na topic which features frequently in\nher songs, we were given a blast of her\ndiscontent towards the current administration in the U.S, her expectations\ntowards the elections and her explicit\ninclination towards the Democrats\nduring the intervals between the songs.\nWho can blame her? It\u2019s the right time\nthat America had some change with\nthe first black man in history to ever\nbecome president. God bless America.\nAnd the rest of the world of course.\nDiFranco had many lovely goodies in\nstore for us. We were again charmed\nwith some of her old artillery like the\nbreathtaking \u2018Overlap\u2019 which had the\naudience singing along and clapping\ntheir hands enthusiastically. The shimmering guitar loop, showering of the\nvibes in conjunction with the laidback\ndrumming complemented Ani\u2019s soul-fulness, casting a deeply chilled, blissful\nspell throughout the whole auditorium.\nLikewise, in the upbeat \u2018Both Hands,\u2019\nwhat stood out the most was the refreshing quality of Ani\u2019s vocals, playful\nand heavenly harmonising. \u2018Imagine\nThat\u2019 saw DiFranco carving crushingly\nsweet and flowing melodies, \u2018Imagine\nHot Chip\nBrixton Academy\nHHHHI\nthat I\u2019m on stage\u2019 she coos, well, dar-ling, the world is your stage.\nIn contrast, DiFranco belted out \u2018Napolean\u2019 with much gusto, the melodically meandering verse leading to the\ncrescendoing chorus, delivering her all\nand deeply sustaining the word \u2018Napolean,\u2019 as if her whole might depended on the emotions that were conveyed\nthrough the deliverance of these three\nsyllable. The simple chord strumming\non the guitar and not so full instrumentation allowed the vocals to soar\nfreely, exhilarating indeed.\nThe night\u2019s success has to be also\nattributed to DiFranco\u2019s trio backing\nband; they did their customary exceptional job, with Alison the drummer,\nblazing away with the suave beats,\nTodd the double bassist and keyboard-ist, adding warmth and strength in texture with the strings and last but not\nthe least, there was Mike who added\nsaccharine tinkering on various percussion instruments such as the metal\nxylophone and marimba.\nSeveral songs from her new album\u2018Red Letter Year\u2019 were given a twirl\nthroughout the course of the evening.\nWith the song \u2018Red Letter Year,\u2019 the\nstrong sense of rhythm was conveyed\nthrough the almost waltz-like beats\nand the repetitive heavy instrumenta-tion. In contrast, \u2018Present/Infant\u2019 was\ngiven a touch of tenderness, DiFranco\nwas neatly embraced by the tranquil\naura of contentment, a testimony to\nher loving bond to her daughter and\nher lyrics defining her intact feminist\nideals in the wake of motherhood.\nSmiling all the way, DiFranco\u2019s trademark blistering guitar audacity was\nacutely demonstrated in most tracks\nthat were performed, especially in the\nanti-war protest that is \u2018Alla This,\u2019 \u2013 \u2018I\nwon\u2019t support the troops, cos every last\none of them\u2019s being duped,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t\njust Ani, the guitar did a fair share of\nthe talking.\nBefore the curtains were drawn, the\nenraptured audience were given a preview of her new song \u2018Splinter\u2019 which\nshe had only just added the finishing touches to. It was a bouncy, light\nhearted, warm melodic piece that\nhad a Mediterranean feel to it, with a\nconstant cute xylophone refrain running through that gave away to a fuller\ntextural, coquettishly sensual, instrumentation interlude from time to time,\nultimately, this carefree number pleasantly filled the night with complete-ness. One could not forget that her\nsignature percussive finger picking was\non show again for this number. Spicy\nmama mia!\nWe will be correct in saying that DiFranco has stamped her trademark in\nthe music business, not only does she\nleave a lasting imprint with her music by producing a CD every year, but\nwhen it\u2019s given to us live, we will definitely take, take, treasure, and there\u2019s\nno stopping. She is still one of the most\nenergetic and enjoyable acts ever to\ngrace a London stage, being a small\nwoman with just an acoustic guitar and\nher valuable vocals, together you get a\nmighty musical force that is awfully\ndifficult to contend with. Expect to\nsee her career continue to flourish and\nmaybe we will see her in UK. Again.\nSusan Yu\nAni DiFranco\nThe Forum\nHHHHI\nAni DiFranco\u2019s vocals soar. Photo by Michael Eccleshall\nAlbum Review\nKeane\nPerfect Symmetry\nHHHHH\nDiFranco picks up her guitar and mixes politics with music\n\u201cSee the light\u201d is a not too timely release\nfrom The Hours, an indie rock seven\n-piece whose first album was released\nlast year to critical acclaim. However\nif the first single of the second attempt\nis anything to go by they have firmly\nthrown themselves in the pit-marked\n\u201cOne Album Wonders.\u201d It\u2019s so repetitive that if you haven\u2019t seen the light by\nSingle Review\nThe Hours\nSee the light\nrelease: 8th December\nHHHII\nthe end of this seven-minute epic then\nyou really are dead.\nThe sound is the same: huge, echoing\nand faintly mournful but it doesn\u2019t flow\nanywhere like \u201cNarcissus Road\u201d or \u201cAli\nin the Jungle\u201d. Ant Genn, a successful\nproducer and Martin Slattery, jazz pi-anist, who have worked beside their\nfair share of big names between them,\nfail to emulate or exceed the great music they\u2019ve helped make. Moreover\nwith Damien Hirst, their friend, creating the album art, and Flood (U2, Sigur\nRos\u2026) producing the ensemble, they\ncould have done so much more. It\u2018s like\ntaking the first bite of a sandwich and\ngetting only the lettuce. There could\nbe some meat in the next bite or it all\ncould be entirely unsatisfying. Only\ntime will tell.\nSarah-Emily Mutch\nIf you haven\u2019t listened to Keane\u2019s new album, just go and listen to it!\nI expect there are a lot of you who, like\nme, were rocking out in your bedroom\nat 15 to the thumping electro-clash\ntunes of Black Cherry and later Supernature, customising your T-shirts and\nwearing fishnets in a vain attempt to be\neven a little bit as cool as Alison Goldfrapp. But eventually, probably, we all\nchilled out and started drinking tea\nand watching the news before bed, and\nthese CD\u2019s ended up in a box in the loft\nalong with those Boyzone albums we\nnever admitted to owning. (Hopefully,\na similar fate befell the fishnets\u2026)\nEven so, if this does sound familiar,\nthen this year\u2019s album Seventh Tree\nwill have been regular ear-candy since\nits release in February. Its tracks have\nthe same electronic energy as those\nwe loved in our teens, but it\u2019s calmer,\nmore subtle and less brash. Basically,\nit\u2019s Goldfrapp, but grown up.\nThe live show was incredible. The\nso easily just-a-bit-too-big-and-im-personal Brixton Academy had been\ntransformed into a mythical and magical wonderland, the stage sprawled\nwith fairy-like musicians dressed in\nwhite playing almost every instrument\nimaginable, a choir in cult-esque animal masks and centre stage was a kind\nof maypole with\u2026 antlers.\nAlison appears barefoot amid\nscreams from the audience, managing to look effortlessly breathtaking\nin what seems to be the top half of a\nclown's outfit made from a bin-bag and\nsome glittery pompoms. Her silky, liquid vocals fill the stage and the punters\nlook on in awe as their undeniably impressive set unfurls.\n\u2018A&E\u2019ispiercinglybeautiful,\u2018Number\n1\u2019 is sweet and personal, \u2018Caravan Girl\u2019\nis uplifting and \u2018Happiness\u2019 is\u2026 accompanied by four bouncing dancers\nin pastel-coloured, hairy jumpsuits. It\u2019s\nall very theatrical, all a bit odd and all\nso Goldfrapp.\nThe audience clap madly to the beat\nof \u2018Train\u2019 and I suddenly realise that\nthe maypole has lost its ribbons and\nbecome, well, just a pole. Out come the\ndancers in bikinis with wolf masks on..\nit\u2019s weird, and disturbingly sexy, but by\nthe chorus everyone around me is going mad and I think we\u2019ve all realised\nwhat is being said; Yes, we\u2019ve mellowed\nout, but it\u2019s still okay to go crazy for the\nnew wave raucous hits like \u2018Twist\u2019 and\n\u2018Strict Machine\u2019, and to dance like a lunatic to \u2018Ooh La La\u2019.\nThe show was a perfect mix of their\nnewer work and a re-visitation of their\nmore in-your-face dance tunes. It was\nlike reminiscing with an old friend (al-beit a much more successful and attractive one) who is classy and modest,\nbut with an unashamedly wild side who\nmakes you feel okay \u2013 nay, proud- of\nthat 15 year-old inside you who loves\nto let it all go. All things considered, it\nwas definitely a show worth seeing.\nGoldfrapp\nBrixton Academy\nHHHHH\nGoldfrapp glitters at Brixton\nFiona Watt\nSusan Yu\nFor their third album released back\nin October, Keane have definitely\nchanged their tact, venturing into new\nexciting sounds. With a departure from\ntheir previous pretty piano-pop style,\n\u2018Perfect Symmetry\u2019 sees Keane experimenting with a more varied instru-mentation, featuring appealing elec-tronically-based sounds. It includes the\nintroduction of guitars, incorporation\nof tasty synths, all in combination with\nstring arrangements and tinkerings\nof saxophones and the musical saw.\nOverall, fans will be greatly pleased to\nsee such a divergence. Believe it or not,\nColdplay are not the only ones to have\nthe experimental flair.\n\u2018Spiralling\u2019 into the deep abyss of\nlyrical and musical ambition, we hear\nKeane emerging from a 1980\u2019s synthpop influenced style with sheer mas-tery. This anthemic odyssey explodes\nat the word go, the 80\u2019s booming beat\npummelsthroughtheentiretrack,driv-ing it forward, sending delicious tingles down your spine whilst the blaring\nkeyboard fires off in the background.\nThe second track tells the story of\ndreams, we hear echoes of The Killers\nwith the use of synthesisers in the prelude that builds into a choral climax.\nGrippingly, we hear the lead vocalist\nTom Chaplin\u2019s gorgeous voice soar\u2013\u2018I\ndreamed I was watching young lovers\ndance\u2019 yet \u2018The Lovers are Losing.\u2019\nIn \u2018Better Than This,\u2019 the syncopated rhythm is joined by a picked guitar hook, something novel, giving the\nwhole piece an upbeat, bouncy feel.\nPleasantly playful and light. When Rice\nhits the high notes, we are definitely\nreminded of the legend that is Justin\nHawkins from The Darkness. How we\nmiss those rockers\u2026\nWe see the synths feature in the sonic soundscape in \u2018You Haven\u2019t Told Me\nAnything\u2019 as well as the appearance of\nnew wave guitars. Unsurprisingly, with\nthe fifth track-\u2018Perfect Symmetry,\u2019 we\nsee Keane\u2019s trademark piano arrange-ment. \u2018I wish we can make sense of\nwhat we do.\u2019 These guys turn to philosophy in this intoxicatingly lush, melodic piece- \u2018Who are you and what are\nyou living for? ... [Some may] find life\nis unkind and over so soon.\u2019 It is impossible not to say that Keane have a\ntremendous gift for writing splendidly\nprovocative and moving lyrics, they\nreally do possess lyrical prowess that\nhas been manifested through all three\nalbums.\nWith \u2018You Don\u2019t See Me,\u2019 again we\ncannot but be obliged to compare these\nguys to The Killers, with the moody\nsoundscape and the underlying synthesisers and piano accompaniment.\nThe brilliance of this track is emphasised by Chaplin\u2019s amazing intonation\nand range in the vocals.\n\u2018Again and Again\u2019 has us reminiscing\nat the quaintly bewitching and dynamic sound that was their debut album\n\u2018Hopes and Fears.\u2019 But with a twist to\nit, as we hear the synth-pop influence\ncoming through once more.\nThe pace dwindles in \u2018Playing Along.\u2019\nThe change of palette sees sprinklings\nof mesmeric repeating electric guitar\nrefrains and a sirenesque mixture of\ndistorted sounds at the end. We should\nall \u2018turn up the volume until\u2019 we \u2018can\u2019t\neven think.\u2019\nSimple piano chords with hints of\nhip-hop beats help accompany the\nninth track \u2018Pretend That You\u2019re Alone.\u2019\n\u2018Love is the End\u2019 is the sentimental\nultimate track of this wonderful concoction of varied soundscapes. The\nmelody is achingly wistful yet delightfully beautiful, Chaplin\u2019s soulful vocals\nwholesomely replenishing our hunger\nfor pure quality singing. Breathtaking.\nHeavenly. Words are not enough.\nThe palette used for this album is\npainted with powerful shades of all colours that are provocative and exhilarat-ing. Bold, extravagant and evocative,\nKeane has achieved something that is\ntantamount to \u2018perfect\u2019ion! revelation.\n\n"

I, sci-ence, the science magazine of Imperial\nCollege and a sister publication of felix\nwas nominated for the magazine of the\nyear award, whilst everyone\u2019s favourite\nAngry Geek was nominated for the\ncolumnist of the year award.\nThis year\u2019s awards ceremony, held\non the 26th November in Shoreditch\nTown Hall, certainly had the cream of\nthe crop, with 800 entries being whittled down to 5 per category. After\nenjoying the free champagne, canap\u00e9s and the obligatory chit chat with\nthe other students, it was time for the\nawards to begin.\nThe competition in each category\nwas strong, all of the Imperial entries\nfacing stiff competition, with felix being up against Nouse from the University of York and Varsity from the University of Cambridge. However, before\nthe winner of this category was an-nounced, it was first the turn of Live! in\nthe student website of the year award,\nwhich they won last year. Unfortunately Live! was unable to make it two in a\nrow and the title was passed on to cher-well.org, University of Oxford.\nOnce the winners had left the stage,\nit was then time to find out who would\nbe named columnist of the year. Although Angry Geek didn\u2019t win the\naward, he did come runner-up, with\nthe judges saying that \u201che was clearly\ncapable of showing a little bit more\nthan just sheer anger.\u201d For obvious reasons Angry Geek himself wasn\u2019t there\nto collect the award, instead a member\nof the felix team went to collect it on\nhis behalf.\nNext it was the turn to find out what\nthe judges had to say about I, science.\nAgain, there was stiff competition in\nthis category as all the other publications were multi-category magazines.\nHowever, it was I, science\u2019s ability to\n\u201cengage an audience who would not\nnormally be interested in science\u201d\nthat really impressed the judges, and\nas a result was awarded the runner-up\nposition in the magazine of the year\ncategory.\nThe eventual winners were Quench\nfrom Cardiff University who were so\novercome by the award that one of\ntheir members fell over, although that\ncould have something to do with the\nfree champagne available earlier in the\nnight.\nAfter the members of the Quench\nteam had left the stage, it was time for\nthe grande final\u00e9 and the naming of the\nstudent newspaper of the year. Nerves\nwere slightly settled after Nouse from\nthe University of York, who were\ntipped by some as favourites, were\nnamed runners-up. With the Nouse\nteam settling back in their seats, it was\ntime to hear what the judges had to\nsay about the winning entry, with this\nyear\u2019s award going to felix.\nThe judges, who included Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, commented that felix managed to \u201cclearly\nengage its audience, with well thought\nout news pieces and a quirky sense of\nhumour that made it stand out above\nTom Roberts looks shellshocked as he receives his Student Journalist\nof the Year Award on Wednesday\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nthe rest\u201d. As the result was announced\nthere was a massive sense of excitement and sheer joy, with the members\nof last year\u2019s felix team rushing onto\nthe stage to collect their prize. Tom\nRoberts, last year\u2019s editor in chief, was\nso stunned that he didn\u2019t even realise\nthat the award was being handed to\nhim, as seen in the picture on the opposite page.\nThe felix team barely had time to sit\ndown and celebrate their award, when\nthe final winner of the awards ceremony was announced. The student journalist of the year is considered the top\nprize for an individual, with this year\u2019s\naward being given to felix\u2019s very own\nTom Roberts. Mr Roberts has also won\na seven week long placement with the\nGuardian, which he intends to do over\nthe summer.\nClearly felix, its contributors and\nsister publications have very big shoes\nto fill this year, something which they\nare definitely planning on doing in the\nhope of a similar result next year.\nBeing the best of the best\nI\nt\u2019s the morning after last night\u2019s\nGuardian Student Media\nAwards ceremony, and triumphant ex-Editor Tom Roberts\ncomes down to the felix office to\ngives us his views on the past, present\nand future for felix and himself.\nWere you shocked and surprised\nby last nights results?\nI\u2019m incredibly shocked we won. I\nthought we were going to get columnist\nand magazine but not the newspaper\none, maybe I\u2019m just being a pessimist.\nAnd then for me to get the student\njournalist was even more shocking because I wasn\u2019t even nominated in any\nof the categories.\nYou clearly must have done\nsomething right with the paper\nfor them to notice you. Has it\nsunk in yet?\nNot really, and I\u2019m not sure when it\nwill. Probably when I start the internship it\u2019ll sink in, but I mean I\u2019m at a\nscience college, I shouldn\u2019t be winning\nthis.\nDid you have journalistic ambitions before you started felix and\nhas this award spurred you on to\ncontinue professionally?\nI did have ambitions. Yes I\u2019m doing a\nphysics degree but I love English. I love\nreading, I did English literature at ALevel and I wanted to keep my writing\nskillsgoing.AndIenjoywritingforpeo-ple, to entertain them so when I started\na TV Editor it gave me the chance to do\nall that and flex my writing muscles so\nto speak. As I\u2019ve worked my way up the\nladder, I slowly realised that I wanted\nto this. The first day I walked through\nthe felix door to ask Rupert Neate to\nwork on TV, I knew I wanted to be the\neditor for some reason, that was a really eerie feeling. I didn\u2019t want to do it\nstraight after my first year, so I waited\na year and was made Deputy Editor in\nmy second year.\nI had ambitions from the beginning\nof how I wanted the paper to look, and\nI think I achieved that, but I don\u2019t think\nyou would ever believe that you could\nwin the awards.\nI don\u2019t think I will ever forget felix,\nespecially not now. It\u2019s been such a\nlarge part of my university life, how\ncan you?\nHow did you rate yourself against\nthe other papers that were in the\nnewspaper of the year category?\nI can\u2019t remember most of them right\nnow. We get Varsity sent to us every\nweek, as well as Cherwell every now\nand then and we all like reading them.\nThese are very good newspapers from\ngood universities that I respect and the\nfact that we beat them, especially being\na science college which doesn\u2019t have an\nEnglish degree is great.\nIf anything it\u2019s a testament to you\nguys, I mean you\u2019re the volunteers, you\ncome in spending your spare time to\nget the paper done, I\u2019m simply here to\nhold you all together. A huge amount\nof credit has to go to you guys.\nDo you think the culture and the\nfact that we are all volunteers doing science degrees that are keen\nto write for felix helped at all?\nI do. If you look at the photo we took\nat the end of the year, the sheer number\nof people in there shows how much of\na group we were. That one photo says\nit all really, and especially if you look\nat the outtakes on facebook you\u2019ll see\nus all jumping on each other and just\nhaving a good time.\nYou\u2019ve taken a bit of a step back\nthis year in your involvement\nwith felix to focus on your stud-ies. One thing you have been\nheavily involved with is one of\nfelix\u2019s magazines, Another Castle.\nCan you tell us a little bit more\nabout that?\nDaniel Wan interviews this year\u2019s Guardian Journalist of the\nYear and editor in chief of last year\u2019s felix Tom Roberts\nAnother Castle is the new gaming magazine. Gaming is one of my\nmain hobbies. I\u2019m a massive geek who\nlikes playing computer games all day!\nWe\u2019re producing three this year with\nthe first one coming out on the 12th\nDecember.\nIf you\u2019re into computer games and\nwe have got an interview with Peter\nMolyneux who is a big name in British\ncomputing games.\nAre you looking for another\naward next year then?\nHa, maybe. We\u2019ll have to wait and\nsee, I don\u2019t want to count my chicks\nbefore they hatch. It would be quite\nnovel for the Guardian to recognise a\ngaming magazine but we\u2019ll have to wait\nand see.\nHow would you compare felix\nthis year under Jovan, to how\nyou were doing last year?\nYeah I think he\u2019s taken over the mantle well so far. He\u2019s kept the style the\nsame which I think is good, I was reading the comment section last week and\nit is lively as ever, most notably this\nImperial Girl, she\u2019s creating quite a stir.\nI think that\u2019s good for the newspaper\neven though I do find her a slightly peculiar but there you go! But yeah I think\nthe paper\u2019s looking good this year.\nRupert Neate\u2019s felix a few years\nback also won the same prize, but\nthey were very different papers.\nHow do think the judges viewed\nthe changes in the paper?\nIt\u2019s interesting because felix changes\na lot each year, for some reason we almost have a tradition here that the design has to change. It\u2019s stayed the same\nthis year, which I think is a good thing.\nIn my year of felix I drew upon the\ninfluences from Rupert\u2019s year as well\nas Andy Sykes\u2019 year. The news stories were more investigative, akin to\nRupert\u2019s year, although we maintained\nthe balance that Andy kept as well as\nthe quirkiness.\nIt was quite surreal to see Andrew\nNeil say that \u2018we like their quirky style\nas well as their willingness to take risks,\nespecially with their front page\u2019. At that\npoint I think the penny dropped and\nwe couldn\u2019t believe it.\nYour humour was distinctive\nlast year and it seemed to have\nfiltered down though the section editors as a whole. Do you\nthink it worked quite well for the\npaper?\nThat was my intention all along\n(laugh). I wanted something that you\ncould take seriously but at the same\ntime you wouldn\u2019t be mindnumbingly\nbored; I mean our news pages have a\nsection dedicated to LOLCATS on\npage 2! I wanted to strike that balance\nreally because we are students after all,\nwe have a hectic schedule with lectures\nand everything, especially at Imperial,\nand if you can\u2019t pick up the paper and\njust chat a little bit then it\u2019s not doing\nits job. But at the same time it has to be\ninformative and I think we got it pretty\nmuch right last year.\nWell congratulations again\nand good luck on your 7 week\nplacement.\nI\u2019ll still be around to pass my wisdom\non, and if you ever want to come for\nlunch just let me know.\nWait a minute, those two pieces of glass have our name engraved on it. Oh wait, they\u2019re our Guardian\nStudent Media Awards for Best Student Newspaper and Student Journalist of the Year. Nice.\nIf you\u2019ve ordered a bottle of Magners\nfrom the Union bars since the start of\nterm, you may want to stop reading\nhere. felix can report this week that\nImperial College Union has knowingly\nsold an excess of Magners Irish Cider\nthat has passed its best before date.\nThe mass order of 330ml bottles was\nmade prior to Freshers\u2019 Week for the\nspecial promotion offering a bottle for\n\u00a31.50 plus a free half pint plastic glass.\nHowever, the Union obviously overestimated the number of bottles they\nwere able to shift, and left with an excess of bottles that only sold out this\nweek.\nIt is not illegal to sell food or drink\npast its \u2018best before\u2019 date, as only the\n\u2018use by\u2019 date must be strictly adhered\nto. The \u2018best before\u2019 date refers to the\nperiod where upon the \u2018quality\u2019 of the\nproduct is at its \u2018peak\u2019, but not a date of\npredicted expiry.\nA member of the bar staff, who wishes to remain anonymous, disapproved\nand was unhappy they were forced to\nserve unfresh bottles, which are dated\nbest before 01/11/08, to unsuspecting\nstudents without notifying them.\nWhen serving two bottles of Magners to a customer in their original bot-tles, they were quickly \u2018snatched off\nthe bar\u2019 by another member of staff,\npoured into pint glasses, and reserved.\nThis member of staff in question then\nunderhandedly told our source of the\nsituation on a strictly need-to-know\nbasis, and the bar staff were not openly\ntold in private prior to serving.\nOur source also revealed that in an\nattempt to sell off the bottles as quickly\nas possible, they were used in Snakebites, the popular half-beer/half-cider\ndrink amongst students. This compromise was not communicated to the\nstudents.\nMany students have found out in the\npast weeks from friends working behind the Union bars, and are annoyed\nthey were not informed beforehand.\nOne regular customer described the\nDan Wan\nNews Correspondent\nOut of date Magners sold to\nuninformed students\nUnion\u2019s actions as \u201csubstandard\u201d, and\nfelt that their own Union should be\non their side and not underhandedly\ntrying to sell them unfresh drinks. Another student had noticed the refusal\nto sell Magners bottles in their bottles,\nbut had \u2018thought nothing of it.\u2019\nfelixcontactedMagnersIrishCiderin\nClonmel, Ireland and told that they did\nnot \u201ccondone\u201d the Union\u2019s actions, but\nthe Union had abided by the law. They\nwere extremely keen to learn more of\nthe situation and the circumstances in\nwhich the bottles were bought so close\nto their \u2018best before\u2019 date. At the time\nof print, felix was also unable to get a\ncomment from the Union regarding\nthe situation.\nImperial \u2018disappointed\u2019 with\nthe cut in Foundation Year\nprogramme posts\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nEditor in Chief\nFinal year medical students are facing an even harder task of getting jobs\nwithin their own foundation school at\nthe end of their degree.\nProfessor Derek Gallen, National\nDirector of the UK Foundation ProgrammeOfficesaid\u201ctheUKFPO,under\nthe direction of the MMC Programme\nBoard (England), has requested that\neach Foundation School in England reduces the number of posts they offer\non the online recruitment system by\nsix. This is because the total number of\napplicants has fallen short of the total\nnumber of posts, which means some\nposts will be unfilled. The shortfall in\napplicants disproportionately affects\nthe severely under-doctored areas of\nEngland.\nThe best way to address this shortfall\nis to remove a number of posts across\nEngland so that the effect of the shortfall is minimised. There are enough\nposts still available across the UK to\nensure that all eligible applicants who\nmeet the person specification will be\nplaced. It is predicted that, based on\nthe first choice preferences nearly 90%\nof applicants will still be allocated to\ntheir first choice foundation school.\u201d\nSeveral of the London Medical\nSchools have raised their concerns\nover the issue, with Najette Ayadi\nO\u2019Donnell, Imperial College School\nof Medicine Students\u2019 Union Vice\nPresident (Careers & Alumni) saying\nthat \u201cImperial College students are\ndisappaointed with UKFPO\u2019s recent\nannouncement regarding the loss of\nFY1 prorgammes. We are concerned\nwith the implications of this loss and\nconcerned with what this means for us\nand our neighhouring London medical\nschools. London has the most over subscribed medical schools in the country\nand for a reason. One third of all medical students are at a London medical\nschool and any FY1 programmes we\ncan secure are welcomed and wanted\nprogrammes. What we really need to\nknow now is the impact of this directive and how many of our students are\nnow not going to work in the foundation school of their first choice.\u201d\nULU MedGroup, the collaboration\nof the five London medical schools,\nmet yesterday to discuss their response\nto the MMC programme board.\nThis is not the first time that London students have felt hard done by\nthe national application process. Last\nyear, 62% of Imperial final years were\nallocated their first choice post, compared to the 92% UK national average.\nImperial is hoping to see a change in\nthese results when the allocations are\nreleased on 6th January 2009.\nWhat a fresh pint of Magners should look like\n\n"

I should state my position at this juncture, having played\nfor both IC and RSM. While playing\nfor the RSM we had members of many\nother clubs and societies such as foot-ball, OTC and running give it a go,\nwhereas IC has extremely rigid team\nboundaries where players within the\nclub didn\u2019t even move between teams\n\u2013 god forbid newcomers try it out.\nI\u2019m an Engineer and I play RSM\nhockey, so the faculty clubs are not\nsolely for faculty members and give the\nopportunity for people with Imperialsized timetables the chance to try a\nsport without a huge commitment.\nThesmallerclubsgenerallyplaysport\non alternative days to the IC clubs that\nplay BUSA leagues, and sticking to\nwhat I know RSM hockey play regular\nSundaymixedhockeymatcheswhereas\nIC hockey play regular men\u2019s and women\u2019s Wednesday matches with the odd\nmixed hockey matches. This means a\nlower time commitment in the smaller\nclubs, and the ability to play another\nsport as well. One member of the RSM\nhockey team plays regularly on Sundays but also fences on Wednesdays\nfor IC Fencing Club, that opportunity\nwouldn\u2019t be available to him if he were\nto join IC hockey.\nThe smaller clubs generally enjoy a longer history and older tradi-Tim Hartford-Cross says no to super-clubs\ntions, dating back to when the medical schools and Constituent Colleges\n(RCS, CGCU, and RSM) were separate\nentities. It seems that the sports editors agree with the previous Rector\u2019s\nattitude in turning IC into a corporate\nwarehouse and scrapping any sort of\nhistorical significance from the College. It seems that the larger IC clubs\nwould happily hand in their old crests\nfor some lovely blue shaded arial font\nbranding.\nMedics need their own clubs mainly because of their crazy timetables\nwhich means they can fit training and\nsocial side around schedules packed\nwith clinical and academic work. It\nalso means they can conveniently have\nsocials in the Reynolds around which\nthey all live, and play at Chiswick instead of having to hike to Harlington.\nHistory, tradition and medic pride\naside, it is no coincidence that every\nuniversity in the country has separate\nmedics sports teams.\nThe reputations of the clubs vary in\na way that attracts different types of\npeople. I know, for instance, that the\nattitudes within IC Football Club detract people from joining. Seven teams\nare not big enough to enable all those\nwho come to trials (usually enough for\nat least nine teams!). This is not a bad\nthing but having an alternative for people who want to play occasionally and\nsocially seems like a good all-inclusive\nattitude that the union should have, after all we are stakeholders in the union\nso we should all be able to get involved\nif we want to.\nAs for the money, union funding corresponds to the numbers of members\nand the number of leagues they are\npart of etc. so why should some people\nbenefit from union funding and others\nnot. It seems a little elitist, after all it\u2019s\na students union not a sporting prowess union.\nThe IC teams are overflowing this\nyear as are the smaller clubs teams\nleading to the question which bench\nwould the RSM players get to watch\nthe IC games from, \u2018cause they sure as\nhell aren\u2019t getting more than stoppage\ntime on the pitch.\nImperial College player representing RSM in the 2008 Bottle Match\nThe starting line up was unchanged,\nwith the exception of debutant Jeff\nJia, who joined Eddie, Darius and\nYan. Eddie got us off to a flying start\nwith a stunning 3-0 victory over the\nUCL number 1. Darius did just about\nenough to win his first 3 matches.\nThe intensity of the match was such\nthat Christian felt he needed to take a\n1 minute time out (perfectly legal, but\nquite rare at our level of table tennis)\nafter a bloody good point from Darius.\nAlthough the game had little bearing\non the outcome of the overall result, it\nwas the one which you could see Darius really wanted to win, and he did\njust that by taking it in the decider.\nEddie, meanwhile, was going about\nhis business in typically economical\nfashion, steamrolling through his op-ponents. Jeff was having a very impressive first appearance, winning 3-1 and\n3-0 respectively against the UCL 1 and\n2. It was thus quite surprising that he\nlost against their number 3, but entirely forgivable. He did end the evening\non a high by taking his final game in\nstraight sets. And Yan, described as\nour \u201cconsistency man\u201d by Darius, was\nstayed true to form with 3 wins from 4.\nUCL had a little consolation in taking\nthe doubles but this was a good night\nfor Imperial, and a much needed one.\nTable Tennis\nUCL Men\u2019s 1st 3\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st 14\nMichael Sathyendran\nSnowflakescascadeddownontheShogun\u2019s windshield en route to the aptly\nnamed 2008 \u2018Marlow Fours and Pairs\nHead\u2019. Except that it wasn\u2019t in Marlow,\nit wasn\u2019t really a head race and scullers\nwere also competing. ICBC had seven\ncrews racing; two from the women\u2019s\nsquad and five from the men\u2019s squad,\nall in coxed or coxless fours. Due to\nthreats of flooding the head race was\nmoved to Dorney lake and the usual 5\nkm head course was run in lanes less\nThere is snow business like row business\nChristina Duffy than 2 km long. The serenity of the\noutside snow suddenly became less attractive when crews had to alight their\nvehicles and were disgusted when the\nrealisation suddenly hit that what appeared like fluffy white snow was actually a cold grey slush that stuck to your\nface and dribbled down your neck.\nPre-race coffee could not be found\nand the caffeine-free crew had to race\nfor time only since they were the single entry in the W.S3 4- category. The\nwomen\u2019s coxed entry of Louise Hart,\nRo Smith, Selina Graham and Chloe\nSymmonds with cox Larissa Matley\nwon the WS3.4+ in a time of 8:01.96.\nTwo seconds was the losing margin\nfor both men\u2019s crews in the first division of racing. Fireman Sam Henry\nFieldman coxed John Dick, Dom Meyrick-Cole, Tom Arnott and Will Todd\nin the S2.4+ category. They came second to Balliol College BC who finished\nin 7:10.4. Following the testosterone-filled performance seat 3 Meyrick-Cole\nwas beside himself with excitement: \u2018I\ndidn\u2019t know until after the race that I\nwas racing with the same Will Todd\nthat won Henley and Pair\u2019s Head. He\u2019s\nsuch a man.\u2019 The other men\u2019s crew of\nMatt Lunt, Mike Zammit, Chris Pollock and Rob Tod coxed by Connie\nPidoux were defeated by Nephthys\nwho came home in 7:25.97.\nIn the afternoon\u2019s division three\nmen\u2019s crews were racing. In the senior\nthree coxless fours (S3.4-) ICBC had\ntwo entries who finished in first and\nsecond place. The winning crew were\ncomposed of Alex Gillies, Richard\nWinchester, Adam Seward and Andy\nGordon who clocked a time of 6:19.34.\n10 seconds later were Tom Bell, Brook\nMcLaughlin, Iain Palmer and Josh Yerrell taking the runner-up position.\nThe final win of the day went to Kieran Docherty, Leo Carrington, John\nDavey and Adam Mayall in the S3.4+\ncoxed by Connie Pidoux. Their closest\nrivals were Exeter university: 13 seconds slower than the IC crew who won\nin 6:35.23. Seat 3 Leo Carrington was\ndubious at the initial crew selection:\n\u2018With a volatile Scotsman at stroke I\nwas expecting some mid-race shout-ing, but it wasn\u2019t to be!\u2019.\nWinning S3.4 - crew Alex Gillies, Richard Winchester, Adam Seward and Andy Gordon.

As\nwe speak I have two items\nbeing sold on eBay, one of\nwhich is the lovely Sony\nEricsson Xperia X1 (as much as I love\nthe phone, money does come first). It\nwas pretty obvious that the phone was\ngoing for at least \u00a3400 at that time, but\nI had this one douche bag who had the\nballs to ask, \u201cWould you sell this for\n210 pounds including delivery?\u201d\nThen I had another one who first\nbuttered me up with \u201cI like how you\ndescribe the phone\u201d and \u201cyour confidence in accepting personal collection\ninspires me that you are a trustful seller\u201d, followed by a slightly more sensible\noffer of \u00a3300. Sorry, but the buttering\nup just ruined it all.\nAnd literally just now a buyer by the\nname of \u201cbig.ojsimpson\u201d offered to buy\nmy phone in person, and I am not making this up! For some strange reason he\ninsisted on paying me via PayPal before\ncollection, instead of paying by cash\nwhich would save me the PayPal fees.\nAlso I fear his PayPal payment might,\nfor some reason, become void after-wards. Anything could happen, right?\nI swear I\u2019ve never encountered that\nmany weirdos outside Engadget - a\nrespectable technology blog which\nhas comment sections flooded with\nposts like \u201cFIRST!!!!!111!\u201d and \u201cAPPLE\nRULEZ\u201d.

Don\u2019t let\nthe shiny plastic fool you - I\u2019ve tested\none before and it was quite accurate.\nE\nver wondered why Sony\u2019s\nPlayStation 3 is so expen-sive? Well, my friend, I\u2019d like\nto tell you that it\u2019s actually\nan underpriced supercom-puter. No, it\u2019s not just about its Blu-ray\nplayback feature - it\u2019s the Cell processor which makes the PS3 your home\nsupercomputer.\nLast week EESoc invited John Easton, Senior Consultant of IBM Systems\nand Technology Group, to talk about\nthe Cell Broadband Engine (Cell BE,\nin short) technology. His emphasis\nwas that in the past business establishments were competing over the\nnumber of pieces of technological\nequipment they possess, but today it\u2019s\na totally different story: technology has\nbecome part of commodities and to be\nable to trade faster you have to look\ninto \u201cdoing something you could never\ndo before\u201d.\nAccording to Easton, the current\nlatencies in the trading arena are\ncounted in milliseconds, and each can\ncost about $55,000 (which is eleven\nyears\u2019 worth of a Home student\u2019s undergraduate tuition fees). Methods to\nkeep such latencies down were very\ndifferent even just five years ago: the\nperformance-constrained market\nmeant that companies relied on scaling\nto drive performance and drive down\ncost; today, the market trend indicates\nthat there will be no more space for\ndata centres in London in the next ten\nyears, which is why IBM believes that\ninnovation is the new scaling.\nHowever, the concept of the Cell\nprocessor started way back in 2000,\nwhen SCEI (Sony Computer Entertainment Incorporated) approached\nIBM for an engine that would make the\nPS3 future-proof from day one, and\nabout 1000-times faster than current\nconsoles. From that point onwards,\nSCEI, Toshiba and IBM formed STI - a\njoint technology development alliance\non the Cell BE, and in September 2006\nIBM launched the QS20 blade module\n- the first commercial product utilising\nthe Cell BE, followed by the highly-anticipated PS3 in November.\nThe current generation of Cell is essentially a 90nm nine-core chip with\nten threads, clocking over 4GHz with\n100 GFLOPS in labs (the PS3\u2019s Cell\nis clocked at 3.2GHz). Instead of using the traditional scalar code, Cell\nis programmed with the more complex vector language (known as array\nprogramming), in order to achieve a\nhigher level of parallelisation. This is\nessential for heavy encoding/decoding\nand compression/decompression in\nsignal processing, digital filtering, Fast\nFourier Transform, advanced video\nrendering and many other real time\nprocessing tasks.\nEaston provided some very interesting examples of Cell applications, with\nthe first video being of a medical computer tomography (CT) scan of a human heart. It seemed to be an ordinary\nanimation, but then we were told that\nwith a 3GHz Wintel box, such 3D rendering from 313MB of raw scan data to\njust five 1MB slices would take about\na hundred seconds, which is not very\ngood for the average high-resolution\nCT scanning of 3000 slices (the current Siemens Somatom 64 takes about\n16 hours to process that); but with four\nCell blades a sequence of fifteen samples can be rendered to an even higher\nresolution in less than one second!\nAnother video rendering demo was\nof a terrain rendering engine (TRE),\nwhich showed the performance differ-encebetweenanIntel-basedmachine,a\nG5-dual-CPU one and a Cell machine:\nIntel\u2019s video was still rendering the\nlandscape within the first few frames,\nthen the G5 gave a jumpy animation,\nand finally the Cell gave a smooth visual flight over the mountains.\nEaston then played a recorded video of a life-like Ferrari car rendering,\ndemonstrating IBM\u2019s Interactive Ray\nTracer (iRT) running on fourteen Cell\nblades which, as the name suggests, is\nable to change a render interactively in\nreal time - a feature that is very important for movie productions and product video demos.\nToshiba has also been making use of\nthe Cell BE: back in CEATECH 2005\nthey showcased their \u201cMagic Mirror\u201d,\nwhich virtually puts makeup on you as\nwell as changing your hairstyle. Today\nwe have the SpursEngine - a derivation\nof the Cell BE, running on just four\ncores and clocked at 1.5GHz peaking\nat 48 GFLOPS, and is already featured\non selected Toshiba laptops for hand\ngesture visual recognition.\nOf course, we mustn\u2019t forget the\nPS3, the power of which has been harnessed by Stanford University\u2019s Folding@home, a distributed computing\nproject for studying protein folding\nand misfolding.\nAs of 25th November 2008 the\nPS3 has provided 38.9% of the total TFLOPS with just over 58k active\nCPUs - a very impressive ratio compared to Windows\u2019 mere 5.26% over\n235k active CPUs. And of course, you\nget to play games with stunning graphics and physics on the console!\nWhen asked if NVIDIA\u2019s GPGPU\n(General-Purpose computing on\nGraphics Processing Units) is seen as\nCell\u2019s biggest competitor right now,\nEaston simply admitted that it is definitely more powerful than Cell is intended to be (as proven by Folding@\nhome statistics: 42.2% of TFLOPS from\n16k active CPUs), but for programmers\nthe GPGPU is harder to work with; the\nonly real fear will be Intel\u2019s Larrabee\nGPU, due out in late 2009. Don\u2019t worry\nthough, IBM, as the PS3 will keep us\nhappy for many more years.\n3. USB Cup Warmer With Mug,\n\u00a32.99, Gadgetshop.com\nCold tea is no good on a cold winter\nday, so this cheap peripheral should\nbe a necessity for those who haven\u2019t\nbothered paying for central heating. I\ngot one of these last Christmas, but the\nwarm winter in Hong Kong made me\nthink I wouldn\u2019t need it here. Fail.\n6.

    "content": "film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n16 felix Friday 28 November 2008\nFilm\nFilm Editors \u2013 Zuzanna Blaszczak and Jonathan Dakin\nNever been scared?\nAfter her mother remarries, Bella\nSwan (Kristen Stewart from Into the\nWild and more recently What just hap-pened) is send to live with her father in\nthe rainy town of Forks, Washington.\nIn a town with a population of 3000\nshe quickly becomes the \u2018local news\u2019\nat her new high school but soon finds\nout that the mysterious and dazzlingly\nbeautiful Cullen kids have a monopoly\non the school\u2019s gossip. Sharing a desk\nwith Edward Cullen (Robert Pattison\nfrom Harry Potter and the Goblet of\nFire), Bella rapidly comes to understand the all-round interest in the Cullens, herself being drawn to the intel-ligent, witty and impenetrable boy that\nsees straight into her soul. When she\nconnects his superhuman strength and\nspeed, his cold hands and his shunning\nof sunlight to the old vampire legends\nspread by the local Indians, it\u2019s already\ntoo late; the forbidden love affair between a vampire and a mortal has by\nnow begun. But Edward is not the only\nvampire for whom Bella\u2019s scent is an irresistible primal pull, it attracts three\nhunter vampires, who unlike the Cullen family don\u2019t mind feasting on human blood.\nI really don\u2019t see how a plot line like\nthis could appeal to anyone but girls\naged thirteen to seventeen, and then,\nonly to those of them that tend to proclaim themselves different and smarter\nthan your average \u2018prom queens\u2019. And\nyet, I can\u2019t bring myself to say the movie\nwas bad. There\u2019s nothing I can openly\ncritisize. If you let yourself accept the\nstory as just that, another story whose\naim is to provide entertainment in the\nsimplest form, Twilight becomes surprisingly enjoyable. The film is well\nstructured, with no plot holes, no annoying breaches of time or space con-tinuity; it has a nice flow to it. The ac-tors, though not remarkable, do a very\ngood job at being believable and have\nbeen very well cast, with Pattison looking every bit the alluring and dangerous vampire (he got all the girls in the\naudience screaming during the screen-ing). This is mainly thanks to the costume and make-up artists who manage\nto make the Cullens visibly stand out\nwithout resorting to using fangs and\nlong dark coats. Also worth mentioning is the scenography; filmed in the\ngloomy and moss abundant rainforest of the Olympic Peninsula the setting for the film is a character in its\nown right. The one thing that I would\nhave really liked to see more of is character development. As much as the\nstory-line was immaculately adapted\nfrom the book, the psychology of the\ncharacters is rather hard to decipher.\nAlthough Bella\u2019s gradual deepening of\nfeelings towards Edward is easy to fol-low, Edward\u2019s behaviour is confusing.\nMillions of American delusional\nteenagers flocking to the cinema\nmeant that Twilight earned $35 million\non its opening Friday. Compare that to\nthe $27 million scored by Quantum of\nSolace and you have the answer to why\nthe movies that are made are made.\nJonathan Dakin\nFilm Editor\nFilmed in \u2018shaky camera\u2019 with the\npremise of being a documentary,\nQuarantine opens with two television reporters, Angela (Carpenter)\nand her cameraman Scott (Har-ris) walking around a fire station.\nThey plan to follow the firemen for a\nnight to give their viewers a taste of\nwhat really goes on in the fire serv-ice. After seeing Angela slide down\nthe fireman\u2019s pole several times, and\nflirt with fireman Jake (Hernandez),\nthe station is quickly called to a local\nblock of apartments, where a woman\nhas locked herself into her apartment.\nAfter finding her they quickly realise\nthat she is infected with a deadly vi-rus, as do the outside policemen, who\ntrap everyone into the building with\nthe zombiefied victims. Cue long\ndark corridors, out of focus camera\nwork and scary looking zombies who\nsoon turn nasty, splattering blood\nacross the camera in some unique\nand original ways. Will the survivors\never escape? And what exactly is the\nvirus that is infecting everyone?\nWhen the film eventually gets into its\nstride, it never stops. Building up nervous tension and fear, and then letting\nit explode into horror style jumps and\nleg snapping gore, Quarantine is a really good chiller-thriller with plenty\nof blood splattering to appease horror\nfans. Although it is a remake of the\nSpanish film REC, Quarantine is one\nadaptation that deserves to be treated\nas well as its original counterpart.\nBoasting an incredible (though sometimes annoyingly) realistic perform-ance, Jennifer Carpenter delivers a\nsolid and scene-stealing role, carrying the audience along with her as\nshe runs, screams, and freezes with\nfear. How would you act if zombies\nwere chasing you around a dark block\nof flats? She perfectly captures how\nmost people would react to this unreal situation, and this heightens the\nfilm\u2019s scares.\nThe action sequences are very effec-tive: this film is not for the squeamish\nas the blood and body parts fly at the\ncamera thick and fast, one brilliant\nbit involves the cameraman using his\nown camera to bludgeon a zombie\nto death. Pretty grisly stuff, but also\npretty cool.\nQuarantine will keep you on the edge\nof your seat, but will also have you\njumping out of it, as the scares are\nnot done for cheap laughs but for real\nterror. Sometimes the camera work\ncan get annoying, mainly because a\nprofessional cameraman would not\nbe so out of focus and shaky, but\nonce you get used to it you get immediately sucked in, finding yourself\nwishing he would turn it certain ways\nso you could get a better look at the\nenvironment.\nAs a horror fan, I am usually disappointed with what film makers have\nto offer, but Quarantine is a highly\neffective and enjoyable film, and I\nwould definitely recommend it to\nhorror fans, as well as anyone who is\nup for being scared: and I mean really\nscared. But if you leave the cinema\nand find yourself looking over your\nshoulder, and then sleeping with the\nlights on, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\nQuarantine HHHHK\nDirector: John Erick Dowdle\nWriter: John Erick Dowdel et\nal.\nCast: Jennifer Carpenter,\nSteve Harris, Jay\nHernandez\nProbably not if you haven\u2019t seen the newest bone-chilling horror\nfrom the director of the 90s indie classic Full Moon Rising.\nRemarkable success of Twilight\nTwilight HHHKK\nDirector: Catherince Hardwicke\nWriter: Melissa Rosenberg\nCast: kristen Stewart,\nRoebrt Pattinson,\nCam Gigandet\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nThis new Baz Luhrmann (Moulin\nRouge, Romeo and Juliet) period epic\nhas been heavily promoted, and heavily praised. Starring Nicole Kidman\nand Hugh Jackman, Australia is about\nan English aristocrat Lady Sarah (Kid-man) who fights against English cattle\nbarons trying to steal her land, joining\nforces with a rugged Australian Drover\n(a person who moves livestock across\nlong distances, played by Jackman)\nwho helps her move her cattle. Tipped\nas an Oscar contender, Australia has\nhad its fair share of controversies, the\nmain one being the casting of the leading man, as Russell Crowe dropped\nComing Out Soon\nout half way through shooting, leaving\nJackman to be replaced last minute.\nWill this love story be a success?\nThink Gone With The Wind with\ncows, deserts, Japanese bombers and\nevil English people. If you like director Luhrmann\u2019s other works, as well\nas long epic historical love stories (e.g.\nCold Mountain) then this film should\nbe for you. Hopefully a film about his\nhomeland should not be as sickeningly\npatriotic as an American film, although\nI am still unsurprised to see us English\nas the villains. But with a (relatively)\ngood director, and a strong cast, Australia should be an enjoyable romp, as\nlong as you can sit through a good two\nand a half hours of yearning passion.\nA\ncrash course in the history of film would go as\nfollows. 28th December\n1895, basement room\nof the Grand Cafe in\nParis becomes the \u2018official\u2019 date of the\nbirth of cinema and the series of one\nminute short films created by the Lumiere brothers make up the first movie\nscreening. We will not go into details\nhere and so we ignore the fact that this\nwas not the first screening of a moving\nimage, and the fact that Edison\u2019s kine-toscopes played films at a small price\nof one nickel already in 1894. Moving\non. It took only about ten years for the\ncinema industry to transform from a\nperiod when films were one shot features maximum one minute in length,\nwith a static camera placed like an audience at a play, to a point where the\nmovies, apart from being silent and in\nblack and white, were not much different to what we can see now. Apart\nfrom continuous technological improvements which brought the film\nformat ever closer to its present form,\nthe movies of the 1910s are so similar\nin their structure because of one man.\nHe wanted to be a playwright. His\ngoal in life was to touch on as many\npolitical, social and moral issues in his\ncreative work as possible. Ironically,\nthe person who completely mastered\nthe film form was the person who\npronounced that \u2018any man enjoying\nsuch a thing [cinema] should be shot\u2019.\nBetween 1908 and 1913 D.W. Griffith directed or supervised over 450\nfilms, shaping the basic elements of\nfilm making into the language that has\nserved cinema for the last 100 years.\nIt\u2019s thanks to Griffith that actors now\nlook natural when acting, that they act\nZuzanna Blaszczak\nFilm Editor\nwith restraint rather than using the\nover-the-top gestures of the first ac-tors. It\u2019s thanks to Griffith that films\nconsist of shots put together in such a\nway as to mirror the process in which\nour minds create space and time. It\u2019s\nthanks to Griffith that something like\n80% of movie shots are close -ups. He\nwas a person to single handedly create\nthe classical form of narrative cinema\nwhich today we are so trained to detect\nand immediately fall for and which, for\nmost of us, is the only form of cinema\nwe know. Incidentaly, Griffith, together with the studio stystem that evolved\nin the 1930s is to blame for the universally formulaic movies we are served in\nthe cinemas right now.\nThe foundations of film syntax have\nbeen laid fairly rapidly and proved to\nbe very lucrative, bringing the movie\nindustry vast amounts of money. Thus\nwhen sound and image were finally\nsuccessfully synchronized at the end of\nthe 1920s the studios were laregly reluctant to make a move from the silent\nmovie form that has been mastered to\nmake a profit to films incorporating\nsound and dialouges. The conversion\nseemed to involve too many imponderables and went against the \u2018no risk\u2019\npolicy of the studio system. Yet Sam\nWarner persuaded his brother to go\nfor it and invest in the Vitaphone disc\nsystem. The consequent commercial\nsuccess of The Jazz Singer in 1928 signified that the sound era had dawned\nand other companies instantaneously\nfollowed suit; the conversion process\ncosting the industry over $300 million.\nAnd so we arrive at the 1930s and the\nbeginning of the Golden Age of Hollywood. But that story will make for an\ninteresting article on its own.\nThe early years of\ncinema\nJonathan Dakin\n\n"

    "content": "sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n36 Friday 28 November 2008\nfelix\nSport\nArabicSoc win!\nLast Saturday the Overseas Societies\nCommittee held their annual five-a-side football World Cup tournament.\nTwenty one teams representing sixteen\nsocieties braved the freezing weather\nto turn up at Kensington Leisure Centre, to battle for the trophy. All the passion of the real World Cup was there\nalong with diving, disallowed goals and\ncontentious refereeing decisions.\nAfter a slow start, trying to get\ngroups and fixtures sorted out, the\ngames began. Trying to fit thirty four\ngroup games onto three pitches is no\neasy task! Gradually though, results\nbecame to come through. The difference in quality between the teams was\nobvious, with hungover teams of near\nstrangers in tracksuits being torn apart\nby well organised teams who train and\nplay together. Most teams took it all in\ngood stead, taking their victories and\ndefeats with grace and humour.\nDue to the odd number of teams\ntaking place, the winners of the five\ngroups plus the three best runners up\npassed into the quarter finals. They\nwere Arabic Society\u2019s first and second\nteam, Punjabi Society, Sri Lankan Society, Thai Society, Iraqi Society, French\nSociety\u2019s second team and Cypriot Societies second team.\nArabic Soc 1 steam rollered Sri\nLankan Soc 5-1, and Arabic Soc 2 beat\nAndrew Holland\nUCL thrashed hard by ladies\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st XI 16\nRUMS Women\u2019s 2nd XI 0\nThe ladies 1sts had vowed revenge on a\nfar from friendly group of UCL players\nafter the rascals defeated our beloved\n2nds earlier in the season. However\ndespite the passion it was a slow start,\ngreat play by everyone\u2019s favourite Sloppy Seconds and MOM Stripper on the\nleft encouraged a few attacks however\nit took a quick run by urban legend\nPraying Mantis to secure the first goal.\nAfter that the shots began to flow,\nencouraged from the sideline by her\nnew lover, Prince Charles was on fire,\ncreaming the ball into the back of the\nnet. Several goals followed with a deflection by fresher Sam and an unlikely\nslap by defender Token Lezza.\nEven at half time when we believed\nwe\u2019d crushed the last of UCL\u2019s spirit a\nwhisper of hope was heard, \u201cthey\u2019ll be\ntired in the second half and they won\u2019t\nwant to win\u201d, suffice to say they weren\u2019t\nthe sharpest pencils in the box. Unfortunately for UCL the pace only increased in the second half, with great\ngoals from Slippery Nipple and Fresher\nShanika.\nThe final goal was a strong short\ncorner which left the opposition in irretrievable goalless pit of doom. Not\nall good though, obviously thinking\nabout the copious fines she\u2019d collected\nover the last 2 weeks Stripper resorted\nto trying to knock herself out in avoid-ance, this didn\u2019t work but the technique was adapted to involve snakebite\nlater that night. Silly rabbit, trix are for\nkids!\nThe fact that gullible had been removed from the English dictionary\nearlier in the week also blatantly had\nan effect on the IQ\u2019s of half the team,\nas Stripper enquired exactly how LepCheryl See\ner shat on the pitch and also Praying\nMantis\u2019 excitement at the arrival of\na famous postman before the game\nstunned audiences pitch wide. However you don\u2019t need brains to play hockey\nand the superior fitness of the Imperial\nteam showed through towards the end,\neither that or UCL (who coincidently\narrived late) had spent too long in the\npie shop before the game. Fines were\ndealt out at the union for DOD Slippery Nipple for finding herself on the\nfloor with her legs open for the second\ntime this week (anyone ever find those\nknickers?) and resident card collector\nWide Open for something of a similar\nnature.\nAlso special mention to the appropriately named Dominator for her\nsuccesses on and off the pitch, (we all\nsaw you sucking the face off ICHC\u2019s\nfavourite serial killer). In conclusion\na successful defeat, and the answer to\nthe mystery who ate all the pies? Well,\nthe ladies firsts can confirm, it was\ndefinitely UCL.\nPunjabi Soc 2-1. In a bad tempered\nmatch, French 2 made it past Cypriot 2\nwith a last minute goal to win 3-1. Iraqi\nSoc beat Thai Soc 3-1, to give the semi\nfinals a distinctly Arabic flavour.\nArabic 1 beat Iraqi Soc 2-1, and\nArabic 2 beat French Soc 2-1 to set up\nan all Arabic Society final. Plans for\na third place play off had to be aban-doned, as the French sulked off, awarding third place to Iraqi Soc by default.\nBy now the games were being played\nunder floodlights, and the temperature\nhad dropped even further to close to\nfreezing.\nThe final was perhaps not the dramatic affair that we had hoped it to\nbe, but that is not to say that it was not\ncompetitive. Both sides clearly wanted\nto win, to secure bragging rights over\nthe other half of the society. Arabic 1\nraced into a 3-0 lead, before Arabic 2\nmade it back to 3-2 by half time. In the\nsecond half, Arabic 1 made it to 5-2,\nbefore Arabic 2 pulled one back. The\nfinal score ended as 6-3 to Arabic 1,\nwho celebrated with the trophy.\nAll things considered, the day went\nextremely well and most people enjoyed themselves. As always, there\nmust always be losers to have a winner,\nand things have to end in disappointment for most of the teams. Still, it\nwas a fun if tiring day out, and the bar\nnight at the Union afterwards was well\nreceived.\nIC Women\u2019s Football travelled to the\nUCL grounds last Sunday to face\nRUMS 2s in disgusting stay-in-bed\nweather.\nFollowing a slew of unfortunate re-sults, IC were looking for a long deserved win. Starting with a 4-4-2 for-mation, Barbara Kiskovski and Lily\n\u201cGenghis\u201d Low were up front, with\nYoke Thye and Pav S on the wings and\nDD and debutant Marion Ferrat in centre midfield. The back line consisted of\nLaura, Cheryl, Kendra and Steph, and\nEmily in goal. IC began the game with\npromise and Kendra was given a free\nrole allowing her to push up to support the midfield. Taking advantage\nof a momentary break in the weather,\nGenghis Low provided the opening\ngoal, smashing the ball it into the back\nof the net. The rain came back heavier\nthan before a few seconds later but IC\nwere not deterred and Genghis Low\nscored again, and then again, thriving\noff DD\u2019s crosses and through balls. A\nfew minutes after Genghis Low got her\nhat-trick, Pav casually flicked the ball\npast the keeper and into the back of\nthe net.\nThe only players in the IC half for\nmost of the first half were goalkeeper\nEmily and Cheryl who was acting\nsweeper. Right winger Yoke was feeling\nfatigued and switched positions with\nCheryl but neither thought it crucial to\ntell the rest of the team causing confusion which RUMS took advantage of.\nThey bounced the ball about a bit in\nthe IC half but to no avail since Yoke\nhas the capacity to take on three play-ers. Cheryl made it up to the team later\nscoring IC\u2019s fifth goal off a cross from\nLaura. Then a few minutes after that,\nDehydys dribbled through the throng\nof RUMS players to put the ball in the\ngoal. Lily scored again but by this time\nshe was considered old news.\nDina came on at half time for the\naging Yoke and played right back as\nSteph was shifted to fill the space in\nright midfield. Dina came on with\na bang and soon enough was taking\ndown a girl twice her size. After seeing\nBarbara take shot after shot and not\nscoring, she finally broke the dam and\nscored three.\nThe rest of the goals came from\nGenghis and Dehydys, who hit an\namazing shot from the right edge of\nthe 18 yard box. Marion had an impressive game with countless shots on\ngoal but unluckily was unable to get\nherself a debut goal. On the other side\nof the pitch, goalkeeper Emily had an\nenthralling match, standing miles off\nher goal line whilst craving vocally for\na cup of tea. Pav netted the last goal\na few minutes before full time. Final\nscore was 16-0.\nBy the end of the first week of Fresher\u2019s\n(a few years ago now) I was sick and\ntired of explaining the game of rackets,\ntherefore in the next few paragraphs I\nshall endeavour to describe this most\nprestigious of racquet sports.\nA bit of history\u2026.\nIn its earliest form during the 18th\nCentury, rackets was played in the\nopen on the walls of the yards of the\ntwo main debtor\u2019s prisons, the King\u2019s\nBench and the Fleet. Gentleman had\nnothing else to entertain themselves\nuntil they paid there creditors. Dickens mentions rackets in the Pickwick\nPapers, as Mr. Pickwick was unlucky\nenough to be put into the Fleet.\nOutside prisons and taverns, Harrow\nwas the first school at which rackets\nwas played, probably from the early\n1820s when the schoolyard was en-larged. When the first Lawn Tennis\nChampionships were played at Wimbledon later in the century, Old Harrovian rackets player Spencer Gore\nwould win the singles.\nThe court itself\u2026\nImagine a squash court, multiply it\nby 3, the service boxes are outside the\ntwo main playing boxes other than that\nthe same markings as a squash court\nand the 4 walls are made of stone. The\nracquet is styled on the old wooden\nsquash rackets and is still wooden today believe it or not due to tension of\nthe string being far too great for any\nother material (even titanium). The\nRackets \u2013 the\nunknown game (to\nImperial Students)\nSam Barclay ball is slightly smaller than a golf ball\nand has changed in its content dramatically since first game was played (all\nstill are hand made and cost roughly\n\u00a39), details of which I won\u2019t bore you\nwith but lets just say from personal\nexperience when the ball is travelling\nat over 120mph on the court it hurts\nwhen it hits you!\nWho plays\u2026\nOne of the main reasons of the\nrackets population being so small, is\nthat bar for a handful courts in North\nAmerica, the only people who learn to\nplay in the UK from a tender age of 13-14 are those who attended one of the\n13 schools in England that have courts.\nEven within those schools not many\nplay due to the demanding nature of\nthe game (quick feet and excellent\nhand-eye coordination are key), from\nmy own school generally it was the\n1st XI opening batsman or the 1st pair\ntennis that were upto the challenge.\nHowever I would encourage anyone if\nthey get the chance to go on court or\neven watch just experience the speed\nof the game, which I find is the addictive part.\nImperial Players\nTo my knowledge at this present mo-ment, there are only 2 rackets players\nin entire university (and we used to\nplay for our respective schools against\neach other not too long ago). If there\nare any of you out there, please contact\nme or indeed if you would like to try\na new sport I would be most happy to\nshow you this wonderful game.\nRUMS feel ICUWFC wrath\nEmma Beresford\nHockey\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st XI 8\nUCL 2nd XI 0\n37\nfelix\nFriday 28 November 2008\nHi Dan, thanks very much for\nmeeting us today. Firstly, can you\ntell us how you ascended from\n1st year medical student to captain of the 1st team?\nWell I didn\u2019t really have the best of\nstarts in my first year as I was injured,\nbut I managed to make it back in time\nfor Varsity was included in the squad,\nwhich was great. We had a very good\nfly half in my second year and so I\ndidn\u2019t feature that much, but he has\nnow left and I just seemed to have slotted into his place. I had a solid season\nlast year and was lucky to get voted in\nas captain for this year.\nHow has the start of the season\nbeen for you guys then?\nWe started off the season with a lot\nof injuries, but now we have settled and\nhave a very good, young squad mainly\ncomprising of players in their 2nd,\n3rd and 4th years. We\u2019ve really come\ntogether now and have won three out\nof the last four games beating UWE,\nSwansea and Imperial, and we are\nlooking to push on up the league table.\nWhere do you see yourself finishing this season?\nOur league is very hard at the mo-ment, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\nWe\u2019re hoping to finish in the top half\nof the table, with the aim of finishing\nin the top three. But we will have to see\nhow everything goes after Christmas.\nImperial Medicals have been in\nthe Premiership for several years\nnow, how do you think you are\nable to sustain such a high level?\nWe\u2019ve always been a good side ever\nsince the medical schools merged, and\nhave always been in a high league apart\nfrom one year, which I think was in my\nfirst year, but we were promoted the\nyear after. We\u2019re very lucky to have 6\nyears worth of students, so we have\nplayers that are that little bit older,\nhave that little more experience and\nare slightly stronger than some of our\nother opponents.\nA lot of it is really experience though.\nBecause we have been in the Premiership for three years we know how to\ncope, we\u2019ve learnt how to play in the\nleague, learnt when to put the squeeze\non teams. It is especially important\nagainst some of the big rugby universities such as Cardiff and Swansea.\nDoes the 1st team have any aspiration to go further and perhaps\naim for promotion into Premiership A?\nThat is definitely our aim, there is\nno point being in a league of you don\u2019t\nthink you aren\u2019t going to win it. Like\nI said, we have a very good bunch of\nplayers coming through and definitely\nwithin the next two years I can see us\npushing for promotion.\nMoving onto Varsity, the College side gained promotion into\nyour league and you mentioned\nthat you played them a couple of\nweeks ago. How can you see the\nMedicals retaining their perfect\nwin record against an ever improving College side?\nImperial have definitely improved\nover the past four years, there is no\ndoubt about that. After playing them\nthis season, it is clear that they raise\ntheir game for Varsity. I think we allowed the score a couple of weeks ago\nto get close, we gave away a lot of pen-Week 2 in the build up to 25th February 2009. This week, Mustapher Botchway\ninterviews the Imperial Medicals rugby captain and wants to know how they do it!\nalties that we shouldn\u2019t have. I think we\ncan only get better, but Varsity is Varsity, it will definitely be a close one.\nWe know the medics have won\nthe rugby and netball matches.\nWhy do you think the other teams\naren\u2019t able to do the same?\nI think the other sports have definitely improved, the hockey men\u2019s team\nhave been promoted and have got better over the last couple of years, and\nI know they desperately want to win\nVarsity and believe they can do it. The\nsame with women\u2019s hockey. Football\nI\u2019m not so sure about. Imperial are very\nstrong in a few sports, such as football\nand squash. It would be great to see a\nfew more of the medicals\u2019 teams compete against IC and maybe make the\noverall competition a little closer this\nyear.\nImperial Medicals have won the\nUnited Hospitals Cup for the past\n9 years now, more often than not\nplaying against the same op-ponent. Do you not find it a little\nrepetitive?\nThe cup is the oldest in the world, so\nto just scrap it after 150 years of history is something I don\u2019t want to be\ninvolved with it. I\u2019d much rather\nkeep that going. There have\nbeen some great names that\nhave played in that compe-tition, such as JPR Williams.\nYes\nGuys, Kings and\nSt. Thomas are the\nmain opponents we\nsee every year, but still\ncome out absolutely\nfired and pumped up for\nit. It\u2019s the same with Varsity, we have to be strong and\nensure a victory, because if we lost\neither, we would get rinsed and I certainly don\u2019t want that to happen.\nI asked this question last week.\nWhat input have Sport Imperial\nhave, if any, to your team and\nclub?\nI think Sport Imperial have been fan-tastic, in particular Nick Gore. They\nhave supported us, and whenever\nwe\u2019ve had a problem, they\u2018ve been able\nto solve it. For example the first game\nof the season against UWE, I didn\u2019t\nrealise that both teams played in a red\nkit, so Sport Imperial kindly got us the\nImperial blue kit to play in.\nMoving onto the social side,\nICSMRFC go on several tours, can\nyou give me a summary of what\nyou guys have been up to?\nWe\u2019ve just got back from an unbeat-Bartos as he is better known in the club, is a very\ntalented fly half with a great eye for a gap and a\nremarkable ability to read the game. Bartarse is also\nquite the lad off the pitch and can always be found\nsurrounding himself with the fairer sex. In his 2nd year\nhe abandoned his testicles and learnt to sing for a light\nopera performance, which most speculate was due to\nthe show\u2019s 75% female cast.\nFACT FILE\nName: Dan \u2018Bartos\u2019 Neville\nTeam: ICSM 1st XV Rugby\nPosition: Fly half\nDate of Birth: 22/11/1986\nHometown: Portsmouth\nCourse: 4th Year Medicine\nHeight: 5ft 11in\nWeight: 84 kg\nAsk the captain -Dan Neville\nen tour of South Africa\nover the summer.

The social\nside is a very important side of rugby,\nparticulary with the\nmedical spirit where\nwe take our rugby\nvery seriously, but\ntend to enjoy\nafterwards as\nwell.\nNow a\ncontroversial\nquestion,\nbut what do\nyou have to say\nto those medical students who\nare playing for IC\nteams?\nI think they should\nplay for the medical\nschool.Always!We\u2019ve\ncome from a history of St. Mary\u2019s,\nCharing Cross and Westminster that\nhave been going for 150 years, longer\nthan Imperial College. We may have\namalgamated and Imperial may have\ntheir own sports, but I think medical\nstudents have their own separate iden-tity. The atmosphere is amazing and all\nthe different sports teams get on well\ntogether, and since they have come to\nstudy medicine they should play with\nthe medical school sports teams, in my\nopinion.\nMedical students are very busy,\nespecially in their later years.\nHow do the students, particularly the rugby players, manage\nto cope with the workload and\nmaintaining the high sporting\ndemands?\nIt\u2019s very hard,\nlet\u2019s put it that\nway. Basically,\nand I am finding\nthis now as I\u2019m in\nmy fourth year of\nmedical school, that\nyou have to often reorganise things. So for\nexample if you have to be\nin on a Wednesday to meet with\nyour consultant because they are\nonly there on a Wednesday, you have\nto try and re-organise to meet with\nthem on a different day when it is convenient for both of you. A lot of final\nyears have to do that and try and make\nup the time elsewhere.\nThere are times, unfortunately, when\nrearranging a meeting is not possible,\nas was the case this Wednesday, where\ntwo of our back row players can\u2019t play.\nOne is a final year and has to do his\nshift in the A&E department whilst\nthe other one had a presentation to\ngive. Also sometimes if you\u2019ve got an\naway game, you can\u2019t afford to miss the\nwhole of Wednesday. I think it\u2019s something that people have had to deal with\nfor several years, there is always a way\nto get out of it and ways around it to\nmake sure that people can still play\nrugby.\nThis was bound to come up, but\ncan you explain the whole light\nopera scene and are there any\naspirations on the stage?\nThat was something I dabbled with\nand it had to be tried at least once, erm\nbut not again. I did do drama for Alevel and came prepared at my interview because I knew they were going\nto ask me about it. But I did enjoy it,\napart from the abuse I got on the last\nperformance when the entire rugby\nclub came and watched, which wasn\u2019t\nso nice.\nSimilar sort of question to what\nwe asked last week to round up,\nlooking at other sports at Imperial. Let\u2019s just start with do you\nknow what orienteering is?\nI should know because I read it last\nweek... but I can\u2019t remember!\n\u201cWe let the game\nagainst Imperial\nget close\u201d\nThe ladies pose for the cameras prior to the match.

A Treaty of\nGuarantee was also signed which gave\npower to Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and\nthe United Kingdom to intervene in\norder to maintain the basic provisions\nof the Constitution and the territorial\nintegrity and sovereignty of Cyprus.\nHowever, keeping up to the provisions of the constitution proved to be\ndifficult quite early on, resulting in\nrecurrent demands for amendments\nto the constitution. Inevitably, tension\nbuilt up between the two communities which subsequently erupted in a\nseries of violent acts all over the island\non 21st of December, 1963. By 27th of\nDecember, the UN Security Council\nreceived a complaint by Cyprus which\nclaimed that Turkey was inappropriately intervening in the country\u2019s internal affairs accompanied by aggression.\nTurkey though, denying the charges,\nmaintained that the Greek Cypriot\npolitical leaders had tried for more\nthan two years to diminish and virtually eradicate the rights of the Turkish\nCypriots.\nTen years of disputes between a proportion of members from both communities followed, climaxing on 15th\nof July, 1974. A coup d\u2019\u00e9tat was brought\non in Cyprus by the Greek Generals\n(Greece was under a military junta\nfrom 1967-1974) and a group of Greek\nCypriots who favoured union with\nGreece. The coup was directed against\nthe democratically elected government\nof the island but the attempted murder\nof the state\u2019s president Archbishop\nMakarios failed.\nCyprus was caught in turmoil for five\ndays, with the head of state being an\nun-elected president positioned by the\ncoup leaders in power. The coup d\u2019\u00e9tat\nwas followed by Turkey\u2019s military forces intervening under the pretext of the\nTurkish Cypriot residents of the island\nbeing threatened by the coup\u2019s leaders.\nTurkey took control of the North of the\nisland and established Turkish Cypriot\nrule on these areas by the evening of\n20th of July, 1974. Following the first\nstage of the invasion, Turkey continued to seek control by a second successful military intervention. The UN\nSecurity Council called for a ceasefire\nand laid the basis for negotiations between Greece, Turkey and the United\nKingdom.\nBy the time that ceasefire was ap-plied, 36.2% of the island was occupied\nby Turkish troops.\nArchbishop Makarios returned to\nhis legal position and the main political figures of Cyprus initiated attempts\nto drive the illegally stationed Turkish\ntroops out of Cyprus. In 1974, the UN\nvoted for resolutions demanding the\nimmediate withdrawal of the foreign\nmilitary forces from Cyprus (Res. #\n353) and the European Commission on\nHuman Rights issued that Turkey was\nguilty of violating six articles of the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThe consequences of this military intervention are still haunting the Cypriots (both Greek and Turkish) even to-day. The Turkish troops number about\n35,000 soldiers on the island with the\ntotal population of Cyprus being about\n800,000. The peace operation, as being\nquoted by Turkey, resulted in 162,000\npeople being forcibly expelled from\ntheir homes. These people became\nrefugees in their own country and were\ndisplaced from their towns in search of\na safe ground controlled by the Republic of Cyprus government. These people comprised 70% of the inhabitants\nof the now occupied part of Cyprus.\nThese people are still denied access\nto their rightful property and are unable to act against the illegal foreign\nland-developers exploiting their native\nland.\nA more tragic side of the invasion\n(stemming back from the era of in-tercommunal disputes) is that of the\nmissing persons. About 1474 people\n(both military personnel and citizens)\nwere captured or disappeared during\nthe invasion period. Persistent efforts\nfrom the Republic of Cyprus government following several UN resolutions\nfor locating these persons have been\nmade. Since 1963, Turkish Cypriot\nand Greek Cypriot families have been\nlooking for their loved ones, some with\nsuccess, but the majority of the missing\npeople are thought to be dead. For the\npast 5 years, the two communities have\njoined forces and a program was set up\nto locate and exhume human remains\nfrom sites that have been marked as\ngraves in order to establish the exact\nfate of these people.\nFurthermore, significant cultural\nheritage sites in the occupied areas\nhave been vandalised. Unique archaeological artefacts from all the historical periods of the Cypriot civilization\n- including sculptures, ceramics, figu-rines, manuscripts and other works of\nart - have been stolen and were illegally exported for trade in the international market and to private collectors.\nIn addition, a significant number of\nchurches were converted into mosques\nand stables, and several of them were\ndemolished, despite their historical\nvalue. For example, the Church of the\nAvgasida Monastery in Famagusta\nwhich dated to the 15th century has\nbeen demolished and many Byzantine\nera icons have gone missing.\nThe problems are not only faced by\nthe Greek Cypriots who possess official citizenship of the Republic of Cyprus. On the 15th of November, 1983\na new state was declared to be formed\nin the occupied part under the name of\nTurkish Republic of Northern Cyprus\n(TRNC). The TRNC is only recognised\nas a sovereign state by Turkey. Following this unlawful creation of the TRNC\nstate in the north, the Turkish Cypriots\ndo not have the opportunity to engage\nin international trade nor political,\ncultural, and athletic organisations.\nPeople who live in the northern part\nhave to endure these embargoes that\nhave been imposed by the international community, as the UN recognises\nthat the legitimate authority on all\nthe parts of the island is the officially\nelected government of the Republic of\nCyprus.\nTo make things worse for the Turkish\nCypriots, Turkey has adopted a policy\nof importing a large number of Anatolian colonists for settling in the occupied area. This has resulted in a change\nof the demographic character of the\nisland. The statistical data on arrivals\nand departures of Turkish Cypriots\ncompared to the ones for Turks from\nTurkey indicated a significant emigration trend of the indigenous Turkish\nCypriots. The Turkish Cypriots are\nsystematically being outnumbered by\nthe incoming, illegal colonists from\nTurkey. Turkish Cypriots are emigrating as a result of the unemployment\nand the social and economic depriva-tions. It has been estimated that 58,000\nTurkish Cypriots (out of a population\nof 116,000) have emigrated since the\ninvasion. The Turkish Cypriots have\ntherefore become a minority in their\nown area.\nFollowing the Anan Plan, rejected by\nthe Greek Cypriots, that proposed a\nsolution for the problem (Greek Cypriots claimed that it was arguably insufficient for offering a viable solution) a\nnew set of talks between the president\nof the Republic of Cyprus, Demetris\nChristofias and the Turkish Cypriot\nleader Mehmet Ali Talat have begun.\nThe two politicians are now carrying\nthe burden of the previous unsuccessful attempts for finding a solution that\ncan be implemented in reality without\ncausing injustice to either of the two\ncommunities.\nHowever, both of them expressed\ngood will and declared that significant\npositive progress will be noted by the\nend of 2008.\nPresident Demetris Christofias and Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat shaking hands in a promising gesture of good will.\nA new era dawns for a divided Cyprus\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n9\nFriday 28 November 2008 felix\nPolitics\nCongolese children approach United Nation troops, a stark portrayal of the desperation of the citizens for the fighting to cease.\nKatya-yani Vyas, reports on the developments in the Congo Republic as the army general is replaced\nT\nhe Democratic Republic of Congo is a country\nin turmoil at the best of\ntimes; never long out of\nthe news, we have grown\naccustomed to hearing about the various dramatic events that have shaped\nits recent history. The latest developments have seen a series of defeats\nagainst rebels in the east of the coun-try, necessitating the removal of the army\u2019s chief of staff. This news followed\nstatements from the advancing rebels\nwho are loyal to Tutsi Leader, Laurent\nNkunda, that they would be withdrawing from two fronts to facilitate the creation of humanitarian corridors.\nPresident Joseph Kabila decided to\nreplace General Dieudonne Kayembe\nwith General Didier Etumba, citing\nthe \u201curgency of the situation\u201d as the\nreason. \u201cKayembe has been removed.\nI guess the president wants to change\nthe dynamics after the losses,\u201d was\nthe reaction of a source close to the\nPresident. It would appear that Kabila is taking steps to ensure that the\ncircumstances improve, so perhaps\nmore changes are to come. Following a\nnumber of chaotic army retreats from\nadvances by Nkunda\u2019s rebels, the decision is most definitely not one that has\ncaused surprise.\nA government army base was seized\ndespite promises from Nkunda that his\ninsurgents would observe a ceasefire, a\nclear sign that they were not planning\nto conduct themselves in accordance\nwith the Congolese government\u2019s rules.\nCongo\u2019s fractured army has also come\ninto combat with the Mai Mai militia,\na faction that are usually considered to\nbe loyal to the government, suggesting\nworrying splits in the national defence\nforce. It has been in poor shape recent-ly, affected by increasingly low morale,\nterrible discipline and allegations of\ncorruption, an example of which is that\nfour soldiers were recently convicted of\nrape, looting and deserting their posts.\nWith these worrying facts in mind,\nit is not surprising that the President\nwishes to take drastic steps to quell the\ninsurgency.\nPerhaps, however, a solution is on\nthe horizon. The government had been\nadamantly refusing to enter into negotiations with Nkunda and his allies,\nsteadfastly denying that any means,\nother than the use of violence, would\nnot be employed in resolving the situ-ation. This was a decision that led the\nBritish Foreign Office to announce that\nLord Malloch-Brown, the minister for\nAfrica, would be travelling to Congo\nto meet Kabila and the Rwandan presi-dent, Paul Kagame, to discuss the vio-lence, which erupted at the end of August and has displaced at least 250,000\npeople. Now, ahead of talks between\nthe UN, the rebels and the army, there\nhave been withdrawals from the east of\nthe country, a possible move towards\ncooperation.\nAt the same time, various community\naction groups in the area have written\nto World Leaders in an attempt to persuade them to send more troops to halt\nthe atrocities. They outline that the\nscenes being witnessed in the region\nare horrific, the worst that they have\nexperienced in their troubled history.\nCivilians are executed on the spot and\ntheir corpses line the streets. This is an\nimage that has caused stir amongst the\nworld powers with the UN considering a French resolution to increase the\nnumber of troops in the country by\n3,000, a move that would facilitate an\nimprovement in peacekeeping efforts\nand control of the situation.\nSo what should be expected for Congo in the coming months? A resolution\nto the conflict? This is an overly optimistic suggestion, the situation will\nride out this brief lull in the violence\nand will deteriorate unless the UN,\nthe army and the rebels find a way of\nnegotiating so that a compromise is\nreached. \u201cNever back down\u201d is the age-old adage, one that has been used by\nNkunda and Kabila, and one that neither side wishes to relinquish.\nRebels withdraw in DR Congo\nPresident Joseph Kabila and his close allies. The conflict had been worsening due to his hardline attitude that negotiation was impossible. UN forces have now stepped in.\n\n"

The staff are suitably attentive and the eccentric owner has a\nlarge wardrobe full of gaudy Hawaiian\nshirts which add to the otherwise muted colour scheme.\nThe two cooks at Som Tam were\ntrained at the famous Blue Elephant\nrestaurant in Fulham and it shows in\nthe exquisite food. The portions are\nsatisfyingly large and full of fresh in-gredients. Be warned, however: when\nthe menu says \u201chot\u201d they really mean\nit.

Snog serves two flavours of\nfrozen yogurt \u2013 green tea and natural\n\u2013 and there is a large variety of fruity\nand cake-related toppings to go with\nSNOG HHHHK\n32 Thurloe Place,\nSouth Kensington\nifancyasnog.com\nBest: Yummy, scrummy frozen\nyogurt for the same price as\nHaagen Daaz\nWorst: Yummy, scrummy frozen\nyogurt and not a lot else.\nCalories: 78 calories for a small\ntub (if you\u2019re interested)\nPrice: \u00a32.85( small)-\u00a37.95 (very\nlarge); 65p toppings\nthem. Both yoghurts are moreish and\nso refreshing that you can just sit in\nthe caf\u00e9 all night and order rounds and\nrounds of the stuff. Frozen yoghurt is\nthe perfect antidote to sitting at home\nand getting through tubs of H\u00e4agen\nDazs or Ben and Jerry\u2019s (depending on\nwhat\u2019s on offer in Sainsbury\u2019s).\nIf you were wondering why on earth I\nwould try to sell a frozen yogurt shop to\nyou in the middle of winter, you would\ndefinitely benefit from their \u2018Winter\nWonderful\u2019 warm toppings. Try a Natural Snog with a shot of expresso or an\napple crumble topping. The gorgeous staff are the second best thing at Snog\n\n"

For years Britain has been\na country of promise for many abroad\nwho seek a better life for themselves\nand are prepared to toil at the expense\nof their dignity and a decent wage \u2013 a\nlot more than can be said for many of\nBritain\u2019s own citizens. I admire these\npeople who lead a life I cannot even\nconceive, as I sit here in my comfy flat\nfree from the grind of employment,\nidling the day away after my lectures,\nlanguishing, writing and what I like to\ncall philosophising. I need to embark\non this opinion piece with extreme\ncaution, lest it be taken the wrong way\nand I get marred with the wrong label.\nCaz Knight \u2018philosophises\u2019\nT\nhis week, let\u2019s try an article under the right name,\nand maybe even with a\npicture representing my\nactual gender\u2026\nI love body mod. I mean, really, really love it. Not just tattoos and normal piercings, but all the crazy stuff\nmost people consider going too far\n\u2013 surgical modifications, tongue split-ting, dermal anchors, microdermals,\nimplants, scarification \u2013 I even think\nsuspensions are cool (for those of you\nwho are mod purists, yes I know some\nof those are technically piercings.) I\u2019m\nnot saying I\u2019d get everything on that\nlist. There is such a thing as knowing\nwhat suits your body; in the same way\nas you don\u2019t wear a circle skirt if you\nhave \u2018powerful\u2019 legs, you don\u2019t get 30\nfacial piercings if you have elfin fea-tures; but just in general I think body\nmod on the right person in the right\nstyle, is awesome.\nOn the other hand, the other day I\nwas talking to an old friend of mine\nwho was considering getting a breast\naugmentation, and I was arguing vehemently against it. She\u2019s gorgeous.\nShe doesn\u2019t need bigger boobs, she\nlooks absolutely stunning the way she\nis. In fact, she\u2019s been one of my beauty\nidols for a long time - when we were\nsmall, I always wanted to look like her.\nCosmetic surgery makes me very uncomfortable \u2013 I don\u2019t like the idea of\naltering your body just to fit in with the\nideal of how society thinks you should\nlook. She looked me up and down and\nreplied \u201cSo why do you get pierced?\u201d\nI have to admit, for a minute or two\nthere, she did have me. Body mod is\njust that \u2013 a modification made to your\nbody to change the aesthetic appeal,\nand anyone who argues otherwise is\nin denial. Implants \u2013 shaped silicone\nsurgically inserted under the skin to\nmake a shaped bump on the surface \u2013\nare even generally made out of a similar stuff to the silicone implants used\nin breast augmentation. It seems really\nhypocritical to be pro mod and anti\ncosmetic surgery. Especially given the\nhuge fashion for tattoos and piercings,\nand the increasingly large subculture\nof \u2018alternative\u2019 people.\nThis is where I start to realise why\none is ok and the other isn\u2019t \u2013 it comes\nBody mods are purely for\nlooking cool says Calliope\nI know the government meant well\nwhen they tried to inject this utopian\nideal into British life but this notion\nhas gone horribly, horribly wrong.\nWhat it has come to mean is many different cultures living in their own little\ncorners, going about their business all\nthe while trying to tolerate each other.\nTolerance is another value Britain\nloves to celebrate thinking that is a\ngood thing. It isn\u2019t. Tolerance breeds\ncontempt. It grits its teeth and bitches\nabout you when your back is turned, \u201cI\nwill put up with you but I won\u2019t do a\nthing towards trying to like you or even\nunderstanding you\u201d. So, on the surface\nthe government has fulfilled its ethical\nduty by encouraging a tolerant, multicultural society.\nBritain in 2008 is anything but Westminster\u2019s daydream of that pan-cultur-al society they envisaged. Little is done\ntowards integrating people into British society: having Diwali posters in\ntube stations simply just isn\u2019t enough\nto eliminate these racial barriers and\nmake Britons more savvy to the ways\nof our new friends. Nor will Notting\nHill Carnival suddenly bring many\ncultures happily together. 363 days of\ntension-woven tolerance builds up and\nmanifests itself at the end of those 2\ndays, which are otherwise a glorious\naffair and a chance to stuff my face\nwith deep-fried Jamaican dumplings.\nAnyone not of British extraction\nfeeling anger or victimisation are well\nwithin their rights given the huge\namount of ignorance that comes from\nmany Britons. I look with disdain on\nanyone who condemns immigrants\nfor \u2018stealing\u2019 all the jobs, leaving nothing but the more menial ones: the jobs\nare there, go and get them and make\nsomething of yourself! Better work\nflipping burgers than on the dole. A\nfriend of mine who was on the dole\nreacted with indignation when I suggested he try McDonald\u2019s as a stop-gap\nuntil he found something more suited\nto his abilities. (Perhaps not applicable to current economic situation\u2026 I\nwouldn\u2019t know, obviously.)\nOn a walk through Bishop\u2019s Park the\nother week, I saw a Muslim man kneel\non the ground and begin to pray at his\ndesignated time. I admired his lack of\nself-consciousness and his faith and\nwished I could approach anything\nwith that steadfastness in life. A group\nof children stopped and stared and\ngawped, totally baffled by this scene\nand I was reminded of the level of\nmisunderstanding, especially among\nyounger generations who should be\nused to cultural diversity.\nThe problem the government faces is\nunraveling this self-induced situation\nwhere people of different backgrounds\nlive and lead their lives in isolation from\neach other. One cannot send everyone\nback to their respective homelands at\nthe peril of human rights and further\neconomic collapse. Stay the way we are,\nand we are nothing more than a time\nbomb until the next civil war rips us\napart. The problem is so large because\nmost people are not interested in other\ncultures and are much happier associating with their own kind and to hell\nwith integration. Comforting to hear is\nthat Boris Johnson plans to tackle this\nby holding less cultural events aimed at\nspecific ethnic minorities, instead having events which emphasise how all\nour cultures are interlinked.\nWe need to stop tolerating and\nstart embracing, loving and learning\nmore about those different from us.\nMy last sentence seems a little naive,\nbut if people\u2019s attitudes changed towards what multi-culturalism stands\nfor, then maybe minorities would not\nfeel oppressed and not feel the need to\nform gangs and shoot people. (Gross\nover-simplification, I know.) However,\neven if we reach this new level of cultural symbiosis, the government still\nneeds to think fast about immigration\nand the fact that physically, there will\njust not be any room left in which to\nbreathe.\n\u201cWe need to stop\ntolerating and start\nembracing, loving\nand learning\nmore about those\ndifferent from us. \u201d\nOne way of bringing different cultures together... maybe not for everyone though\ndown to fashion. I do not agree with\ngetting your body modded for the\nsake of fashion. Period. Mods are not\na fashion statement; they are a permanent thing, which is either expensive,\ndangerous and difficult, or worse, impossible to completely remove. Piercings leave scars. Laser tattoo removal\nleaves hideous marks everywhere, and\nconverting them rarely works out. Anything more serious than that is pretty\nmuch forever. Going into a studio for\nsomething you think is pretty when\nyou\u2019re 16 and regretting it the rest of\nyour life is idiocy. I have never had a\npiercing I didn\u2019t seriously think about\nfirst. I still have no tattoos because\nI\u2019m still working out who I want to do\nthem, and saving up for the best artist\nI can find, who\u2019ll do the style I want.\nThese things are not fashion and neither should cosmetic surgery be.\nIf you\u2019re a happy, comfortable person\nwho is fine with their body and wants\nthe new surgery OR mod because\nyou\u2019ve genuinely thought about it,\nthink it looks cool and are fine with it\nbeing that way for the rest of your life,\ngo for it! If you\u2019re horribly insecure, or\nlook at yourself in the mirror and hate\nwhat you see, modifying it will never\nbe a permanent solution. I hate to be\none of those people who go around\ntelling everyone to look at their inner\nbeauty and embrace their flaws \u2013 everyone has fat days. But believing that\nyour bad body image days will vanish forever if you can just look more\nlike your favourite ideal - whether it\u2019s\nDita von Teese, Britney Spears, Agy or\nSqueak, is just plain dumb. Sort out\nyour image as it is before you start trying to change it.\nIncidentally, if you\u2019re interested in\nbody mod, I know I\u2019m not the only\nperson who\u2019d like to see a body mod\nsection in felix. It\u2019s not fashion. There\u2019s\nloads of stuff we could write about -where the good and bad studios are\nlocated, what the different types of\nmodification actually are, costs, specific artists, design ideas, even the\nculture behind body mod. Our emails\nhave been completely ignored \u2013 even\na polite rebuttal with an explanation\nwhy we\u2019ve been rejected would be better than silence. Email calliope206@\ngooglemail.com with support.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re horribly insecure, or look at\nyourself in the mirror and hate what\nyou see, modifying will never be a\npermanent solution\u201d\nOld Imperial Women isn\u2019t her mother yet: she can\u2019t cook chicken\nI\nmostly browse felix in that inter-mittent, anonymous space between morning classes and afternoon essay/class, munching,\nsomewhere in the library caf\u00e9\nafter snatching a copy from that space\nby the door. The first few pages tend\nto be news bits and lengthy columnist\nramblings, enough to get me mildly lethargic and skimming over the rest of\nthe paper with its nice mix of thoughtfully written articles. Although I am\nregularly amused by the Angry Geek,\nto whom I give the honour of seeking\nout first in the mess of columns.\nI see Imperial Girl has come under\nfire of late for a) being too femininely\nfluffy and b) having the nerve for swiping her own precious column space in\nfelix for such writings. Meh. Imperial\nGirl, I could join in with the rest throwing bored jibes at you, or just shrug and\nsay that there\u2019s a reason that most men\ndespise Sex and the City, and therefore it\u2019s not surprising that in a male\ndominated university and newspaper,\nmost appear to despise your column\nwhen all you\u2019re writing is just what\nmost of the girl-girl conversations in\nthe JCR are full of. Instead, let me offer\nmyself up for sisterly sacrifice. Readers, the likes of Imperial Girl might be\njust right for this paper, if you give her\nmore of a chance. Someone else could\nbe even more nuts.\nLike myself.\nI\u2019m not a hot, young, single undergraduate anymore. I am in fact an\nanonymous postgraduate, the kind\nlurking within less well-known chunks\nof the university, in a fairly well-trod-den relationship. More clearly, I\u2019ve got\nthree compulsory classes a week, tons\nof reading to do, plenty of time to be\nworried about not schooling myself\ndamn well hard enough, and lots of\nwondering about how a relationship\nis meant to change as it ages. Yep, indoctrinated geek girlfriend, that\u2019s my\nalternative label. And I\u2019m aspiring to\nturn into an old housewife, it seems.\nLast night, lurking in my too far-away\nprivate housing, I attempted to single-handedly cook a roast chicken dinner\nwith all the trimmings for my long-term boyfriend and I.\nMany hours later than planned and\nnursing extremely painful burns while\nsurreptitiously quaffing the accompanying red wine from the bottle, the\nrealization comes.\nWhy?\nWhy, why, oh why?\nTo mark for my efforts, I\u2019ve got one\nseveral times microwaved, very prettily\narranged plate (designation: Boyfriend)\non the table. (Ready for presentation if\nhe ever comes in and gets it \u2013 no, no,\nmustn\u2019t nag, mustn\u2019t accuse, what I\nhave now learnt from this mature 16\nmonth-long relationship is that a real\nrelationship is surely about compromise\u2026). My own plate is somewhere\namongst the clutter of the kitchen\ncountertop, with a few viciously splattered blobs of mashed potato swung\noff the spoon, vegetables boiled to hell\nuntil they gave up, and some shreds of\nmeat that look like they were pulled\nfrom the roast chicken by hand. They\nwere, in fact, in between hopping about\nwaving my pre-scorched fingers vigorously in the air and trying not to swear\nwithin earshot of no one in particular.\nIt wasn\u2019t all my fault- the chicken was\npartly spoiled after sitting in the fridge\nfor five days and I\u2019d already had to snap\nthe raw legs off it with my bare hands\nand hack off bits of too-soft fat in a\none-handed way that would make my\ndissection supervisors of yester-degree\ncover their eyes in pain, then cook it\nvehemently beyond recommended\nroasting time.\nBut at what point had roasting a\nchicken become on par with a night\nsuch as \u2018Go out and get wonderfully,\nresoundingly smashed with friends\u2019?\nJust what the hell was I doing? I looked\nat the one well-arranged plate with a\ncalculated 80% chance of not giving\nBoyfriend food poisoning. To compensate for the extra wetness of the\nvegetables, I\u2019d sprinkled gravy granules\nstraight on the plate and then spent\na few minutes pounding them with a\nfork to make them stop looking like\npellets of grey rat poison (I swear they\nweren\u2019t, honest) and more like, well,\ngravy. My vision blurred; I saw a frozen pizza instead, like the other three\nhe\u2019d already bought at the time when\nI laid hands on the chicken and then\neaten singlehandedly. Why. Don\u2019t. I.\nJust. Buy. Pizza. For us. Too? My mind\nboggled.\nI\u2019d said it was because of the credit\ncrunch, but now I realized that I was\njust another woman, mad on the power\nof ostensibly making her own choices,\nvowing never to be like her mother\nwhilst being exactly like her, trying to\nresurrect and remake the memories of\nthe crappy parts of her own childhood,\nmaking a civilized roast dinner by\nherself (Boyfriend defensively playing\nWarhammer 3000 in the next room,\nvowing he didn\u2019t know a thing about\nroasting chickens), for absolutely no\nbloody reason whatsoever. It seems I\nam not yet a fully grown woman. I\u2019m\njust another hybrid of girl and the nostalgic memories of her mother. In more\naccurate terms, I\u2019m a slave to my own\nnurture and upbringing. Genes don\u2019t\nmake you aspire to good roast dinners\nin your very early twenties.\nBoyfriend surreptitiously hid his\nown full plate for later disposal, possibly full of wine or, more likely, fearing the overcooked, oversoft chicken.\nI slid back to my chair to pretend to\nwrite my essay and instead write this\nsorrowful lament.\nReaders, be thankful you still have\nsomeone young, single, sweet and female to write columns full of wonder-ings and romantic dabbles for you,\ninstead of the rantings of some wild\ninscrutable postgrad kept woman\nhack. If you\u2019re male? Just accept that\nsome really do think like Imperial Girl\nand turn the page if it gets too painful.\nCome now, don\u2019t look like that. What\nelse are they going to fill the space\nwith? More half arsed horoscopes?\nEat and get fat, my chickens. I\u2019m going to make a meal out of you. Well I\u2019ll try, I can\u2019t say how it\u2019ll taste...\nViscount Kensington thinks\neverything is absolutely fine\nE\nverything is fine. Everything\nis indisputably spiffing. I\nhave noted that it is a little\nchilly outside but that, my\ndear ladies and gentlemen,\nis why we have central heating systems.\nIf you are one of the people without a\ncentral heating system then this newspaper ought to make very good insula-tion, so do feel free to stop reading and\nstuff this page into your coat.\nAh, I appreciate that I am assuming\nyou have a coat there. If you are lacking\none, then permit me a pompous chuck-le, a miserly humbug and a recitation\nof a line from Dickens\u2019 \u2018A Christmas\nCarol\u2019 about surplus population.\nEnough with the tangents, the devia-tions, the endless musings and incessant ponderings and infernal consid-erations! I am going to assume that\nyou, reader, are not homeless, are not\nstarving, are not sobbing into your pillows to the music of some dark and\nmirthless artist. I will credit you with\nmore ambitions than suicide and get\non with the damn point. Everything is\nabsolutely fine.\nThe economy is shepherded by wiser men than you or I. Wise men that\nI perfectly intend to do all possible to\nremove from power in the next General Election, after which I shall duly\nspit upon the corpse of their principles\nfrom the vantage point of some fiery\nequine paid for by the exploitation of\nthe poor.\nAfghanistan and Iraq are probably\nbut a few days away from blooming\ninto paradises of freedom, prosperity\nand peace. It is said that you reap what\nyou sow and we sowed cluster bombs,\nthe harbingers of hope.\nWhy, already from Iraq we are reaping an awful lot of oil, which, being\ntraded in Euros, is leading to copious\namounts of the weak Pound Sterling\ninundating my already burgeoning\naccounts.\nIn truth, we must confess that across\nthe world there are a great many other\nissues that may seem to detract from\neverything being absolutely fine. A\nfew people are starving. Some are sick.\nOthers are a trifle beneath the poverty\nline. There are a few trivial matters like\nthat.\nReally, in the grand scheme of things,\nthese people are somewhere else; they\nare not here. If they were here they\nmight eat my horse, like those chaps\nacross the Channel so often do. Smuggling their foreign selves into my estates and cooking my prize stallions. It\nis intolerable. It ought to mean war.\nNo matter. You are fine. I am fine\n(and wealthy). Everything is absolutely\nfine.\n\u201cI will credit\nyou with more\nambitions than\nsuicide and\nget on with the\ndamn point.\nEverything is\nabsolutely fine.\u201d\nEXCLUSIVE COMPETITION\nFROM HUGO FRAGRANCES!\nWIN HUGO FRAGRANCE GIFT SETS COURTESY\nOF HUGO URBAN RULES CONCERT, FEATURING\nSUGABABES\nThe UK\u2019s biggest ever girl band, the Sugababes, who have\nnotched up a whopping 10 million record sales, will be headlining the nationwide music programme from HUGO Fragrances\nthat uncovers and invests in new talent.

Last year\u2019s Editorin-Chief, Tom Roberts, triumphantly\nwalked out of the Guardian Student\nMedia Awards clutching the Student\nNewspaper of the Year Award he richly\ndeserved.\nThe felix team worked immensely\nhard last year, and there is nothing I\ncan put in print to describe exactly\nhow pleased I am that felix has got\nthe national recognition it deserves\nfrom Tom\u2019s editorship. It\u2019s an even better feeling knowing we achieved this\nthrough our own passion entirely.\nWhat I mean is, writing for felix was\nnever toil, or \u2018real\u2019 work. We are all en-gineers, scientists and medics whom\nhave already signed away our immediate futures into fields so far from jour-nalism. In charge, was a geeky Physicist\nalready in question. We have no Journalism or English courses here. Yet, we\nmanaged to beat off numerous other\npublications produced by journalists,\ndesign artists and literature students.\nSo, it all comes down to a mutual\npassion for writing. Through passion,\ncame dedication. Through dedication,\ncame hard work. And through hard\nwork, comes rewards. And Student\nNewspaper of the Year is only a fraction of ours. The rest of our reward\nis from you, the readers. The sense of\npride seeing students value your work\nwithin their busy week is something no\nGuardian Award can give.\nSaying that, this award sets a benchmark for the newly assembled team\nthis year. By no means is it impossible\nto repeat the achievement. The paper\nis picking up speed as the academic\nyear unfolds. So boys and girls, let\u2019s\nset award-winning felix cat free once\nagain.\nHave a little gander at the interview I\nheld with Tom in the News this week,\nand laugh at his funny, yet accom-plished, face of confused terror as he\ncollects his award.\nSo much for a Fashion editorial then.\nThe boy done\ngood\nF\nirstly I would like to warn\nyou \u2013 this article may be\nrambling and incoherent in\nstyle. This is in part due to a\ndistinct lack of research and\nBeit syndrome: the inability to write articles or do anything productive. Ever.\nRest assured, in no way does this correspond to a diminishing passion for\nclothes. Far from it, I spent my weekend shopping! \u2018Spent\u2019 of course being\nthe \u2018ha-ha\u2019 obviously operative word. I\nhad planned on buying a new bag, or at\nleast something that would not make\nmy lecture notes look like waste by the\nend of the day, and possibly a dress.\nHowever, I came back with two tops,\na cardigan, one skirt, one hat and two\npairs of sick shoes!\n\u201cFail!\u201d I hear you cry. To which I reply\nwith withering enthusiasm \u201cyour face\nis fail.\u201d Others of course would hi-fric-kin-five me on the success of my trip.\nSuch a loot!\nAs we roll on a few weeks and I finally have the bag! However this is a\nmini-saga in itself, so much so it warrants column inches. I will now paint\nyou the picture.\nI have been shopping for hours, it\nis dark and raining and I have scuffed\nholes in my slouch boots \u2013 so I have\nwet feet at this point. Never good for\nmorale! I make it into Topshop, head\nstraight for accessories. No prancing\naround, toying with all the garments\non the rails, or smoothing all the fab-rics. NO. I am on a mission! Upstairs.\nBags. Giant bag. Awesome! Two minutes later and I\u2019m at the cash register,\nthinking I\u2019m about to spend \u00a345 for a\nfake leather bag. Incorrect. I am actually purchasing an \u00a380 real leather bag.\nFrick.\nI will pause the story there to acknowledge the fact most people would\nE\nver wondered about the history of the shoe? Where\nand why it was made? It was\nfirst used by the Greek followed by the Romans. In the\nearly Christian days (third century),\nthey were worn by women to cover the\nfeet replacing sandals.\nIn the 1600\u2019s it became FASHION. It\nbecame a commodity- quality, design,\nextravagance all part of the deal. Just\nthink of those different styles, shapes,\nconstructions, decorations etc.\nFashion in now expressed in different\nways through gender, age, economic\nstrata and social echelon of its wearer.\n\u201cIn every step she takes a trail of fire\nfollows her. With every stride she navi-gates, there is no one beside her. A fortuitous wall serves simply as a paper\nkite punctured by a lethal heel\u2026\u2026\n\u201d\nRohan Anthony Clarke is a shoe designer that takes a romantic view of\nshoes. Ladies, isn\u2019t that just what we\nneed?\nAt the London Fashion Week September 2008, the Spring and Summer\ncollection of clothes were not very\ninspiring as I went through the stalls.\nAccessories on the other hand took a\nleading edge. Rohan\u2019s stall got me arrested in my tracks: The colours, the\nstyle, the design. But most of all, the\nshoes had a history.\nLondon with its distinctive area was\nhis muse, creating shoes with a variety\nof London areas in mind.\nA mixture, blend, of east meets\nwest ranging from THE BRIXTON, to\nSLOANE RANGER. Rohan takes you\non a different journey depicting the\nvibrancy of both sides on his centre\nstage.\nWith Rohan Anthony Clarke, there is\nno rush; each woman\u2019s stride should be\ntaken purposefully and confidently.\nSLOANE RANGER\nSloaney or not? Needless to say these\nshoes make a statement about where\nyou come from. Of course sloaney girls\nusually dress with a slightly scruffily\nthough with expertly made up faces; a\nlook which I like to call \u2018The Bedroom\nLook\u2019. That doesn\u2019t mean it is their\nevening look. Oh no, they transcend\ninto expertly coiffed looking girls tipping it up with expensive classy shoes.\nRohan shoes show you what class is all\nabout, appropriately termed British\nnostalgia. Those cowgirl boots discern\nthe hardworking form the lazy bum-mers! What\u2019s more? These range of\nshoes have gold plated holed heels.\nTHE BEAUCHAMP\nPOSH or NOT? Think posh on a night\nout hanging on her man\u2019s arm, camera\u2019s clamouring for her attention.\nSNAP SNAP!!! Wonder where the focus is? SHOES! Rohan\u2018s Beauchamp\ncollection attract the young twenty\nsomething crowd who know how to\nlook good. Teemed with highs, they\nguarantee that you are going to be the\nhead turner in every crowd. Every girls\nenvy and every guys wet dream.\nForget diamonds, shoes are a girl\u2019s best friend\nSwiri Konje was unimpressed with September\u2019s London Fashion Week. One designer restored her faith in\nfashion that day; Rohan Anthony Clarke\u2019s illuminating collection of romantically inspired shoes\nask the sales assistant to restate the\nprice and then calmly back out of the\npurchase. My approach was somewhat\ndifferent. I instead remained cool and\njust bought the bag. I guess the lesson\nhere is: look at the tag that corresponds\nto what you are actually buying. The\nEnd. And FYI the bag and I will live\nhappily ever after.\nNeedless to say many other purchases took place and chip-and-pin machines were fucked good and proper\nby my debit card.\nIn other news, in an attempt to sabotage the studying of a friend, I went\non his laptop and began asking his\nopinion of women\u2019s clothes. This did\nsuccessfully distract him (lols). The\npremise of \u201cthe game\u201d (OMFG \u2013 I just\nlost the game) was this; (OK. I will give\nyou a minute to console yourself about\nlosing the game. Right, a minute\u2019s up.)\neach page displayed a variety of dresses\nand he was made to say which ones he\nwould like to see a girl in. Of course he\npicked the waste ones. This could of\ncourse highlight that I am not dressing\nto maximize my appeal to the opposite sex. Alternatively he probably just\nhas no taste, but has what I like to call\n\u2018waste-taste.\u2019 But it\u2019s always interesting\nto ponder, do you dress to get some?\nSome of Rohan Anthony Clarke\u2019s\ndelicious creations: (from top left\nclockwise) The Clerkenwell, The\nSloane Ranger, The Brixton, The\nRoxy and The Beauchamp.

Write to us.\nclubsandsocs.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nClubs & Socs Editor - Alice Rowlands\nA\nbrief look over previous\nDramSoc productions\nreveals some impressive and ambitious fare:\nChristopher Hampton\u2019s\nLes Liaisons Dangereuses, Tom Stoppard\u2019s Arcadia, Brian Friel\u2019s Translations, even outdoor Shakespeare Performances of Much Ado about Nothing\nand the magical A Midsummer Night\u2019s\nDream.\nAll these have shown a Drama troupe\nwith taste, class and theatrical nous. So\nyou\u2019d be forgiven for asking, upon seeing the poster for our latest offering:\nRobin Hood: A Pantomime, \u2018Why the\nhell are you staging a pantomime!?!?\u2019\nI\u2019m the producer, and I was asking that\nvery question when we decided to.\nHowever, after reading the script,\ngetting a cast together and working\non some of the craziest technical challenges we\u2019ve had recently, it all began\nto make some sort of surreal sense.\nRobin Hood is a story so worn over\nyou could tell it in your sleep. A hero of\nEnglish folklore, he has a band of merry men, robs from the rich to feed the\npoor, splits an arrow in half at a tour-nament, and is a thorn in the flesh of\na corrupt monarch, Prince John, who\nhas taken rule of the country while his\nBrother King Richard is away. Also,\nmost of the tales of his heroism centre around conflicts with the Sheriff of\nNottingham, and he invariably gets the\nlovely Maid Marian, who has no choice\nWhy a pantomime?\nRecently, DramSoc has put on\nshows with a variety of styles; ranging from Shakespearean classics\nto the artistic Arcadia. These, of\ncourse, can be a lot of fun for actors and audiences alike.\nWith this play, however, I was\naiming for something more like Terry Prachett\u2019s Mort \u2013 specifically, to\nhave a large cast and for the focus\nof the play to provide light entertainment as opposed to the more\nserious drama of the recent past.\nGiven that Mort was two years ago\nnow, I felt that it was high time to\nhead in that direction again.\nAnother consequence has been\ngetting a lot of new actors involved with the society, which\nhas been very good for us. And\nhey, it\u2019s Christmas. What better\nthan a panto?\nHow did you come up with\nthe idea to do Robin Hood?\nI visited the girl who\nwrote the play \u2013 a good\nfriend of mine \u2013 in Canada\nover the summer, and she\nwas kind enough to show\nme a recording of the first\nproduction of the show. I\nfell in love with it then and\nthere, and made her agree to allow us to stage the first UK production of it.\nKnowing the playwright has had the secondary benefit that I\u2019ve\nhad a good deal more freedom to change bits of the script here and\nthere, which I hope will translate to the show being that bit more\nalive for the audience.\nThis is the second play you\u2019ve directed this term. Are you the only\nperson allowed to direct DramSoc plays?\nAh, no, not at all. On the contrary, as the Acting Director I\u2019m only\nsupposed to step in and direct plays when no one else can be found\nto do so. Unfortunately, a lot of the long-term actors left the society\nall at once at the end of last year, meaning that the number of proposals was fewer than we might have liked. As a result, here I am\ndirecting my second of the two plays for this term.\nThere\u2019s a rumour flying round that this production of Robin Hood\nhas no arrows in it. Explain yourself.\nI think I\u2019ll just leave my answer to this: this isn\u2019t Robin Hood as\nyou\u2019ve ever seen it before.\nSo can we expect anything different from what Wikipedia tells us\nabout Robin Hood, then?\nHell yes.\nWhy should we come to see it?\nBecause it\u2019s going to be a great show? The comedy in the show\nis witty and intelligent without being difficult, and the cast has thoroughly enjoyed rehearsing the show, which in my experience usually translates to the audience enjoying it.\nPantomimes usually involve audience participation. Is this any\nexception?\nThe audience is important to the show, certainly! There\u2019s plenty\nfor them to get their teeth into \u2013 though you\u2019re going to have to\ncome along to find out exactly what\u2026\nIsn\u2019t that risky? What if the audience doesn\u2019t interact?\nAt a panto? Please.\nHow did you start in DramSoc?\nMy first play was Mort. Basically, I just went along to an audition\nand got handed one of the lead roles\u2026 and DramSoc hasn\u2019t let go\nsince. So, in a way, Robin Hood is a bit like revisiting my start in the\nsociety. Ah, memories\u2026 I hope it\u2019s the start of a good thing for all\nthe new people in my cast, and for all of the people in the audience\nwho\u2019ve never been to one of our shows.\nSo round it up for us?\nThe show\u2019s going to be accessible, contemporary, entertaining\nand relevant. Come see it!\nT\nraditionally summer\nbrings with it a long,\nwell deserved break\nfromacademics,sched-ules and the relentless-campaign, that is, student life at\nImperial. For most, it also brings\nopportunities. Opportunities for\nwork, opportunities for leisure and\nsometimes even opportunities for\nservice to the underprivileged.\nSuch an opportunity this year\nwas presented in the form of two\njourneys into the worlds of those\nwho desperately need, but seldom receive. The journeys I refer\nto were the summer volunteering\ntrips offered by Imperial PASS,\nofficially the Imperial College Political Awareness and Social Service\nsociety.\nDuring the months of July and\nSeptember this year, two teams of\nvolunteers associated with PASS\nand a non-profit organization\nPo Yin Association originating in\nHong Kong, set off with the desire\nto make a difference to the lives of\nthose who have little. To bring them\nhappiness, if only for a short while,\nbut ultimately, to return hope to\nthose who had none.\nThe first team ventured out to a\nvillage in the North-Western part\nof the Guangdong province in China on a 6 day visit, while the second\nteam departed for a village in the\nneighbouring Guangxi province,\nfor the duration of 12 days.\nWith the regions incorporating\nsome of the poorest settlements\nin the country, the volunteers attempted to enlighten lives of underprivileged children, by imparting basic knowledge of the English\nlanguage, at selected village schools\nin the respective regions. Using\nunconventional methods to \u201cteach\nthrough enjoyment\u201d, the hope was\nto ease the children from the grim\nreality of their world, if only for a\nfew hours, and allow them to rediscover their childhood.\nOver the course the two trips, the\nvolunteers immersed themselves in\nthe same atmosphere of poverty\nstricken existence\nwhich\nclouded the prospects of each one of these chil-dren. Through a series of home visits the volunteers tried to share the\nweight of the adverse living conditions\nthe children were subjected to and the\nadult responsibility which they were\nrequired to carry from such an early\nage. In an attempt to mildly ease their\nstruggle the teams donated what they\ncould to their households in the form\nof essential supplies.\nThe volunteering team visiting\nGuangdong concluded their experience at their village school by setting\nup a scholarship fund for the academically able while also providing monetary donations to the school for the\nimprovement of facilities.\nThe teams also proceeded to visit\nhistorical and cultural points of in-terest. In Guangdong the volunteers\nvisited the aptly named \u201cunderground\ngalaxy\u201d, a series of subterranean geological structures created through\nnatural geographic processes over\nhundreds of years.\nPASS volunteer to\nmake a difference\nVarun Sharma writes about the PASS summer trip to China\nThey\nwere also able\nto witnesses a cultural performance\nby the locals in the host county of\nLiannan Yao. While those present in\nGuangxi were privileged enough to\nbe present during the mid-autumn\n(Moon cake) festival celebrations\nwhich take place throughout China\nin the month of September.\nUpon leaving China the volunteers unanimously agreed that they\nwere taking with them, a special experience which would allow them\nto view life with a new perspective.\nPASS has organized and will be\norganising a host of fund raising\nevents to finance their future humanitarian projects. As part of the\nfund raising initiative a \u201cCharity\nShow\u201d is being hosted in the Read\nLecture theatre on the 9th of December, further details about PASS\nand their events can be found by\ncontacting their President, Jason\nLin, at hing.lin07@imperial.ac.uk.\nDirector of Robin Hood, Kristen\nFarebrother talks to Tosin\nAjayi about DramSoc\u2019s latest\nproduction\nbut to swoon in his Manly arms.\nEr\u2026 yeah, our story is a bit different:\nyou\u2019ll recognize some things: we have a\nRobin Hood, a little John, a Maid Marian, a Wilhelmina Scarlet (yep, you read\nright) and a gaggle of Merry Persons.\nWe\u2019ve got robbing from the rich to\ngive to the union of disgruntled work-ers, we\u2019ve got Maid Marian seducing\nRobin into stealing so she can rob him\nand head for a life of freedom in Paris.\nWhat we\u2019ve got is whole lot of fun.\nAs the director says, this presents\na totally different type of acting challenge to what we\u2019ve had in the recent\npast. And the peculiar performance requirements of a panto have proved fun\nfor the actors to get their teeth round.\nOne thing we can guarantee, that as\nthe audience, you will be participating.\nOn the technical side, with a scene\nchange seemingly every 5 mins, we\u2019ve\nhad to be inventive, especially when\ndesigning one scene that has 4 visible\nrooms on stage at the same time, with\ncharacters switching between different rooms. Theatre is a hard mistress\nindeed.\nIn the end, as always, the final product proves to be worth all the sweat.\nThe cast of freshers, first timers and\nolder hands really have come together\n\u2013 as you can see from the picture above\n\u2013 to produce a great atmosphere on\nstage and off. We all had tremendous\nfun, and come next week we know you\nwill too.\nDramSoc: \u2018Tis the season for a Panto\nTosin Ajayi tells felix about DramSoc\u2019s latest production\u2013 Robin Hood, the Pantomime:\nThese crazy kids are practicing their sword fighting; you should practice yours too if you go and see their performance \u2013 it\u2019s a Pantomime so that means audience participation\nWhat do DramSoc do?\nDramSoc usually put on around 4 plays a year,\ntwo in the first term and one in each of the remaining two terms.\nWe have recently also started putting on smaller\nproductions in the second term, tied to the acting\nworkshops that are run in the union every week\nfrom 2 pm to 5. Anyone can show up for a trial\nworkshop.\nAside from the regular workshops, we also provide a number of one-off workshops, aiming to\ndevelop skills in anything from stage fighting or improvising to how to direct or produce a play.\nMembers also get opportunities to design, build\nand \u2018dress\u2019 (i.e. paint) the sets, or to help out with\nhair and makeup, lighting, sound or stage management for the plays for the more technically\nminded.\nIf that isn\u2019t enough, DramSoc are also regularly\ncontracted to provide lighting, sound or other technical support for a variety of events in and around\nthe union and college (both for clubs and societies\nand for external organizations hosting events in\ncollege).\nAre most people experienced before they join\nDramSoc?\nWe get a mixture of experienced people and\nthose new to theatre. There\u2019s something for every-one; people with less experience quickly learn from\nthose who have been involved for longer. Passing\nskills on is an important part of the society, and we\nbelieve that the best way to learn is to do, so everyone is given the opportunity to be involved as early\non as possible.\nHow are plays chosen?\nDramSoc holds a play proposals meeting on a\nTuesday (advertised on our mailing list). Two weeks\nlater, the committee hold a play choosing meeting\nto review all the proposals made and decide upon\nthe one we feel will be the best for the society to\nput on.\nHow do people get involved with DramSoc?\nDramSoc have a long tradition of meeting in the\nunion bar every Tuesday evening from around\n7:30. This is a great way to get to know the past and\npresent members of the society \u2013 even those who\nhave graduated still come back every week (and\nare often roped into helping with the shows).\nfelix asks Kristen Farebrother: Who are DramSoc?\nDramSoc\u2019s production of Robin Hood is showing in the Union Concert Hall\nfrom Wednesday 3rd to Saturday 6th December at 7pm.\nTickets are \u00a37 or \u00a35 with a student card.\n\n"

But\nwait, RCS hockey now exists!\nAnyway, moving onto good news.\nThe league table exists in full, there are\nsix pages of sport and Wednesday was\nthe biggest day of sport for Imperial\never! A huge number of fixtures were\nplayed, and Harlington was buzzing.\nHaving interviewed Dan Neville this\nweek, we can sense the Varsity rivalry\nand atmosphere is slowly, but surely\nstarting to intensify.\nIn response to Tim\u2019s opinion on the\n\u2018superclubs\u2019 debate we would not like\nto keep dispelling the sometimes spurious claims, thus we will bring it to a\nclose, barring one last response from\nus.\nFor both football and hockey there is\nmovement between the teams. A no-Following two spirited yet unsuccessful displays against Bedford and Oxford earlier in the season the IC Gaelic\nFootball took the trip to Cambridge\nthis Sunday. Resting on their laurels\nmay have had Cambridge the bookies\nfavourite, but it was also to be their undoing as they were clearly unprepared\nfor the blitzkrieg football that was in\nstore for them.\nThe late withdrawal of Finian McCann from the team due to injury was\ncause for concern leaving Andrew Lavery to step into the overly large shoes\nin the midfield role with Sean \u2018U-turn\u2019\nCleary replacing Noel Ryan in defence,\nalongside Jamie Sanders - the baby\nface of the team fast creating a niche\nfor himself in corner back. Though the\npair were rarely tested, IC\u2019s full back\nline never looked liked conceding.\nThe game started sharply with IC\ngaining possession at the throw in.\nWith an air of arrogance befitting the\nOxbridge type, Cambridge looked\nlacksidasical in both attack and de-fence, and were soon stunned by IC\u2019s\nflamboyance and flair, snatching a goal\nand a point in the early exchanges.\nConor Taylor, who dominated the half\nforward line, supplied Frank O\u2019Neill, in\nthis the first of many well taken chances by the Naomh Br\u00edd pair. Claiming a\nbrace of points IC went 1-03 up to no\nscore when Cambridge made their best\neffort of the half, still only resulting in a\n45\u2019, which admittedly, was struck clean\nover the bar in a great display of kicking from the ground by the Cambridge\nnumber 9.\nImperial duly replied with the best\nscore of the day. Winning possession\nin the half back area, Lavery combined\nwell with Taylor, their swift passing on\nthe right wing, running riot through\nthe Cambridge defence. Midfielder\nEdward O\u2019Hare was soon in on the\nact as IC continued to cleave through\nany resistance offered. With the trio\ncompleting at least 10 passes full forward O\u2019Neill got himself in the right\nplace and was given the ball with expectations of nothing less than a goal\nwhich he delivered; a full force drop\nkick from three yards into the back of\nthe net. The half played out in much\nthe same vein, with Cambridge attacks\nnever even breaching the half back line\nof Donnacha Kirk, Pat McMullen and\nnotably Club Sec Phil Jakeman, acquitting himself like he\u2019d been playing\nGAA all his life - despite the headband\nmaking him look like Rafael Nadal a\nsoppy fagel.\nArdent words from Lavery at half\ntime left the team in no doubt of what\nwe were about to achieve. A new club,\nin its first season, with only 30 minutes\nYou will have to ask the ICUGFC players to find the ball. After you have succeeded, try and digest the intricacies of the scorecard.

So to say there\nis rigid movement is quite debatable.\nWhat we are trying to get as is that\nthese faculty teams do no need their\nown society. They can easily be a significant part of their constituent club.\nIf you say that you play for RSM hockey so you can have a casual game on\na Sunday then why don\u2019t you join the\nhockey club and organise casual hockey sessions on a Sunday. With the size\nof these teams, you could experience\nimprovements in the logistics of travelling to a hockey pitch.\nIn addition, having a faculty team\nwhere non-faculty players play is ri-diculous. This reinforces the view that\nthese teams should be part of their\nconstituent clubs.\nOn a separate note, best of luck for\nnext weeks games and we hope you enjoy your Christmas dinners/socials in\nthe next few weeks.\nseparating us from a historic victory,\nnot least over the prematch favourites\nand rivals Cambridge, meant IC retook the field with all the same verve\nand spirit of the first half. With the\ntruly weak second half display against\nOxford still echoing in our minds, the\nintervening weeks fitness training was\nevident as IC showed no signs of fatigue\nand continued to add scores. James\nSkeen, on loan from ICUAFC\u2019s 4th XI,\nmanaged to keep a clean sheet but for\nthe horrific \u2018header\u2019 in the second half.\nOn several occasions John McDonnell\nshowed poise in retaining possession\nunder pressure and was rewarded with\na score of his own late on. Notching up\nsome well taken points with fine shooting from play, Damian Phelan earned\nhimself man of the match, quickly rescinded however when he elected not\nto head to the pub. \u2018Forgotten soldier\u2019,\nStephen Gallagher of course got himself involved with a goal in the dying\nminutes from close range. Claims that\nhe was only feeding of the scraps of\nother forwards were left unchallenged\nas Gallagher himself was unavailable\nfor comment / not asked at the time of\nwriting.\nAll in all a very successful trip was\nhad to Cambridge with generous post\nmatch hospitality from our hosts.\nICUGFC have got their first win under\ntheir belt and look set for many more\nsuccesses to come in this season and\nthe next.

There are some among\nyou for whom a weekly drunken shag\nand waking up squinting in horror\nat the right side of the pillow is sufficient and the whole hog of Burger\nKing and a trip to Fulham Broadway\ncinema beforehand is superfluous to\nrequirements. Blind dating is not for\nyou. For the rest of you, however, it\nreally is rather practical. Your friends\nare probably just sick of your moping\nabout in need of a good shag, spending\nyour time reading Jane Austen novels\nor playing on your racing computer\ngames and they do have your best interests at heart.\nSadly, blind dating, just like dinosaurs\nin their day and like Tamagochis, are\nset to become a thing of the past. In\nthe modern era when you are just a\nhop and skip away from \u2018facebooking\u2019 the candidate before your friends\neven have time to describe his wonderful sense of humour which completely\ndetracts from the huge nose and acne.\nThere are, of course, come serious advantages to this mild (in most cases)\nform of stalking, for example, discovering that you have actually met this person before and already know that you\ndo not find the idea of another lengthy\ndiscussion of how medicine is only true\nprofession which will take him straight\non to the Fast Track to Heaven in the\nslightest appealing. On the contrary,\nit would be a shame to be put off by a\nphoto of him sporting fish net tights, a\nbra stolen from a girl he secretly wishes\nhe could play hanky-panky with and a\nblonde synthetic wig. Maybe not. Perhaps, for a more open-minded and authentic dating experience it\u2019s better to\ndive in with minimal details: no phone\nnumber, surname or maybe even de-scription. Gender, I should think, is\nstill crucial.\n\u201cWould you like to come up for some\ncoffee/to see my collection of WW2\nstamps?\u201d Sex after a blind date is simply not what one does. Is it? In our\nliberal and democratic (as opposed\nto liberal democratic) society is there\nan issue of having some harmless fun\nwithout a series of doorway kisses for\nseveral weeks in a row? With S.H.A.G.\nweek here, surely all of you are now\narmed with the means to have fun\nwithout the consequences resulting\nin alien discharges. Health and safety\naside, you can do whatever you want,\njust be prepared for a week of mockery from aforementioned friends. You\nknow you\u2019d do the same for them.\nMost importantly, don\u2019t forget to thank\nthose friends (or that pesky ex who just\ncan\u2019t seem to let you get on with your\nown life) when the blind date they so\nthoughtfully arranged for you results\nin a night of passion or even just an\nevening with a person who does not\nstimulate your gag reflex upon setting\neyes on them.

At the break-down, Imperial gave away the first of\na series of stupid penalties, and the\nresulting kick to touch from the opposition fly-half immediately had us\ndefending on our try-line. Again at the\nbreak-down from the lineout Imperial\ngave away another needless penalty,\nand Portsmouth caught us napping\nwith a quick tap and go, resulting in\ntheir big No.8 crashing over the line.\nThey converted, putting us 7-0 behind\nafter just a matter of minutes.\nThe next 5 minutes proceeded with\nlittle incident. Imperial clearly had an\nascendency in the forwards, possibly\ndue to Niall informing his opposite\nman that he did, in fact, have AIDS.\nHowever we failed to produce any sort\nof continuity, due to a combination of\nsloppy hands and needless penalties.\nThen, with Imperial looking a little\nflat, Scott provided the spark needed\nto get the team going. With Portsmouth clearly wanting to mark Sasha\nthe Basha at 13, coupled with the prop-like nature of the opposition 12, a gap\nemerged in the 12-13 channel. Scott\ndarted through with a big hand off\nto the slow inside centre\u2019s chest, then\nstepped through the fullback\u2019s weak\ntackle to score Imperial\u2019s first try. The\nconversion levelled the scores to 7-7.\nPortsmouth soon began to reveal\ntheir game-plan. Their only big talent\nof note was the boot of their fly-half.\nMore needless penalties had Portsmouth gaining territory for fun. Indeed, half-way through the first half,\nfrom a ruck just inside our 22, the ball\nwas passed back to their 10 who slotted a drop-goal through the posts to\nput Portsmouth back in the lead.\nIt was at this point that Imperial\nstarted to come to life. Our ascendency in the forwards continued, with\nChilli and debutant Chris McGeough\nstealing opposition line-out ball at will,\nand the scrum always going forward,\nstealing ball against the head on numerous occasions. We were stringing\nphases together and made yards with\nease. For the first time this season we\nused the mutes and munsters to great\neffect, with stand-in captain Malcolm\nso often sucking in the Portsmouth\ndefence with his hard running. It was\nfrom a breakdown about 10m from the\nopposition try-line that we scored our\nsecond try. More strong play from the\nforwards enabled scrum-half Dave to\nsnipe down the blind-side and touchdown in the corner. Scott then made\nthe conversion look easy to add the ex-tras. The score remained the same until half-time, Imperial leading 10-14.\nThus far the game had not been the\neasy game that many had anticipated,\nand there were some strong words\nfrom Malcolm and Andy MacFadge.\nWe started the second half keen to\nshow why we were a league above our\nopposition. Imperial started the second half in the same way the first half\nended. The phases were all coming together and the backs were playing with\nconfidence, skill and most importantly,\npenetration. The forwards continued\nto provide the quick-ball the backs\nneeded to make deep inroads into\nthe tiring Portsmouth team. Angus\nand debutant Miles rucked tirelessly\nand always got to the breakdown first.\nDespite the constant pressure, it took\nanother ten minutes for the score to\ncome. A quick switch of direction by\nScott sent the centres driving towards\nthe line in midfield. From the ruck,\nmore quick ball enabled Jack Goring\nto show his fly-half skills, and start a\nsequence of quick hands through the\nback line, finishing with Louis diving\nover the line for his first IC try. Imperial led 10-19.\nPortsmouth struck back straight\naway, somehow breaching our defense\nto get into the 22. The ref stopped play\nat this point because Niall was cry-ing. \u201cHe bit me ref, he bit me\u201d. The ref\nlooked at Niall, unsure of what to think.\nNiall pointed at the opposition: \u201cIt was\nthat one ref, he bit me\u201d. A chuckle or\ntwo later, and play resumed. Imperial\ngave away another silly penalty, which\nthe opposition fly-half easily converted to bring the score back to 13-19. A\nbit of quick-thinking saw Scott sprint\nto the half-way line and smack a drop\nkick over the recovering opposition,\nimmediately putting Portsmouth under pressure with a lineout in their own\n22. IC again stole the lineout, enabling\nSasha to crash the ball up. The ball was\nshipped wide to Benjamin, who true to\nhis French flair, sold a dummy before\ndriving over the try-line despite the\nbest efforts of three tacklers. 13-24.\nNow Portsmouth were knackered,\nand it was simply a matter of time as to\nhow many points Imperial could clock.\nA scrum in our own half was picked\nup by Fresher Dave at number 8, who\nsprintedblindsidewithdeceptivespeed\nto take us up towards the opposition\n22. From the resulting ruck, the ball\nwas popped to Fresher Rob (who had\njust come on for Louie) who decided\nthe time was right to score a disgustingly good try. Rob collected the ball\nfrom scrum-half Dave, and grubbered\nthe ball towards the try-line. Rob then\noutpaced his opposite man, fly-hacked\nthe ball over the try-line, collected the\nball and dived over the line. A simply\nridiculous try. 13-29.\nImperial collected the kick-off and\nimmediately set-up a backs move up\nthe pitch. A big shout from Mo inside\nScott opened a massive hole through\nwhich Scott duly penetrated. Despite\nthe double tackle from the opposi-tion, Scott was able to off-load with\na sublime one-handed backhand pop\nto Benjamin who carved through the\nopposition. From the following break-down, the ball was shipped wide to\nRob Thomson who sprinted 50m to\ntouch the ball down over the line. Despite being clean through, Rob continued the habit of the Imperial team,\nwho had clearly decided Scott needed\nto practice his kicking from out wide.\nAll bar two tries during the game, every try was scored out on the touchline.\nDespite missing his previous three at-tempts, Scott learnt his lesson and expertly converted from the left touch-line to make the score 13-36.\nWith only a few minutes left on the\nclock, Imperial still had time for more.\nMo collected a kick over the top from\nPortsmouth. The on-rushing tackler received a ridiculous hand-off /\nopen-palmed punch to the face from\nMo, who then drove Imperial forward\nwith strength. The backs again set-off a move which tore Portsmouth to\nshreds, bringing us into their 22. A\nfew forward rumbles later, Scott found\nhimself with the ball just infront of the\ntry-line. Some quick feet opened space\nfor Scott to play scrum-half Dave in\nfor his second try of the game, wide\non the right touchline. The extras were\nmissed, and the game came to close\nafter an emphatic (in the end) victory,\nwith the final score reading 13-41 to\nImperial. Kingston 1st XV await in the\nnext round for what will prove a much\ntougher test.\nThe trip home was fantastic. A team-wide game of Edward Ciderhands emptied all commuters out of our carriage\nand enabled some prime team-bond-ing time.

But it got me\nthinking: what is it that makes a good\nnewspaper, or for that matter, what do\npeople consider to be good media?\nOutside the student environment\nthere are a myriad of media outlets,\neach targeting a different audience.\nWhen you look at people in the caf\u00e9\nyou will see that even though there are\nmany national newspapers out there,\neach person has their own taste. As\nGilead put it last year in one of his col-umns, a person can be defined by the\npaper they read.\nSo, as I say, this got me thinking: how\ncan the Guardian determine which\nof the many student newspapers out\nthere is the best? I believe, as I pointed\nout during my campaign, that students\nwant a mixture of the serious and the\nlight-hearted. felix doesn\u2019t exist to feed\nthe egos of the writers it has working\nfor it, but to inform and entertain the\nstudents that it serves.\nLast year the paper was very good at\ngetting the news across, as well as doing several investigations and features,\nbut what it lacked was the light-heart-ed aspect. I know it, you know it and\neven your lecturers know it because\nI\u2019ve seen them pick the paper up on a\nFriday as I deliver them: the paper is\nalso there to keep you amused during\nthose long Friday afternoon lectures.\nThe fact that so many students and\nstaff do read the paper (and this can be\nproven thanks to the number of complaints we got when the paper was not\nup to standard) is surely a testament\nto the quality of the paper. However,\nis that what the Guardian looks when\nthey decide the eventual winner?\nEvery week, we get a sneak preview\nof what some of the other student\nnewspapers are doing (some of them\neven send us a copy!) and every week I\nhear people in the office come up and\nsay \u2018Oh I like how they\u2019ve done that,\nwe should do the same,\u2019 or \u2018why can\u2019t\nwe make our section look like that?\u2019\nMy response is simple, why should\nwe? We have developed a style, a style\nthat people at the college can relate\nto; they look at the paper in the boxes\nand can immediately relate to the big\npicture and the headline on the front\npage. It\u2019s different, and it works! Yes\nwe have been changing the appearance\nof some aspects of the newspaper, and\nthe reasons were explained last week,\nbut there is no need to copy what others do.\nSpeaking of change, come the new\nyear some of you might realise that felix will be slightly different. The size of\nthe paper will change, mainly because\nthe printers have decreed it so. Consider yourselves warned.\nBut, once again returning to the\nquestion at the start, what does make\na good newspaper? My main aim is to\nkeep you guys happy; if you like reading the paper every week, take the time\nto do the puzzles, to read the comments and reply, or to read the whole\nthing and point out the mistakes, then\nwe are clearly doing a good job. I\u2019m\nsure if students outside Imperial read\nfelix, then a majority would say that it\nwasn\u2019t to their taste, and it wouldn\u2019t be\nbecause the paper is written to suit the\nstudents at Imperial.\nBut what about the magazines? I\nhear you ask. Well, the same can be\nargued there. There is a larger variety\nof magazines than newspapers in the\nworld, simply because each magazine\ntargets an even smaller group of peo-ple. I, science is a fantastic magazine\nthat caters to the very large science\ncommunity at Imperial, and it is written by students from the Science Communication course, which is the best in\nthe country. So, rather unsurprisingly,\nthe quality of the magazine is very\ngood and clearly the Guardian thinks\nso. But there are others who don\u2019t believe that a science magazine belongs\nin the Guardian category because it is\nnot all-encompassing. Surely, by the\nsheer fact that our one topic magazine\nis in the same category as magazines\nwhich cover a wide range, means that\nwe are doing something right, no? But\nthis is just self-assurance.\nFor now, we\u2019ll carry on going as we\nhave been, and if you guys out there\ndon\u2019t like something, or think the paper can be improved, drop us a line.\nWe are here to inform and entertain.\nWhat makes a\ngood newspaper?\nA pedant, Tim Walls writes\nD\near felix,\nAs an alumnus of Imperial I had the pleasure\nof attending the City &\nGuilds decade reunion\nluncheon today, at which I was also\nfortunate enough to pick up a copy of\nthe current felix.\nFirstly, I would like to say what an\nexcellent occasion the C&G reunion\nwas - a real pleasure, and my thanks\ngo to all those involved in the organisa-tion. Secondly, I have to congratulate\nyou on the standard of felix - the production quality clearly puts to shame\nsome of the efforts during my time at\nthe college.\nSadly, however, I am obliged to find\na bone to pick - inevitably (as I\u2019m sure\nyour postbag is bulging on this subject)\nYasin Fatine\u2019s \u2018Ranting Cubed\u2019 column.\nIf one is going to write such a diatribe,\nand proudly claim within that it is perfect and without error (\u201cGo ahead (you\nwon\u2019t find any!)\u201d,) one cannot complain\ntoo loudly if one\u2019s bluff is called. To\ntake the most jarring example, I sincerely hope the irony in the statement\n\u201cthe thing that I was most appalled\nwith was the amount of spelling and\ngrammatical mistakes\u201d was intentional\n- Yasin must surely be aware that mistakes are discrete and countable. Secondly, his use of \u2018St. James\u2019s Park\u2019 as an\nexample of incorrect grammar in public use is baffling; the assumption must\nbe that he is criticising the use of the\npossessive apostrophes following an s,\nbut of course as any fool knows, both\n\u2018St. James\u2019 \u2018 and \u2018St. James\u2019s\u2019 are equally\nacceptable, if stylistically different.\nIn any event, as they say in Private\nEye, I shall of course be cancelling my\nsubscription, just as soon as I have obtained one.\nKeep up the good work.\nYasin lies defeated on the ground\nafter a brutal verbal assault\nGilead Amit, as opposed to his avatar, has no hat\n\u201cThe cartoonist\ninhabits the\ncentre of what\nmust be one\nof the most\nremarkable Venn\ndiagram layouts\nfound outside\nof an A level\nstatistics module\nexam paper.\u201d\nA. Hannan responds to Felix Whitton\nV\noltaire never said \u201cI disapprove of what you say,\nbut I will defend to the\ndeath your right to say it\u201d\n(PF Boller\u2019s \u2018They Never\nSaid It: A Book of Fake Quotes\u2019, p124).\nPeople promote what they hear as fact\neither due to sheer ignorance, malice\n(deliberate misrepresentation) or misconceptions (they could be lies which\ngoontobecomeperceivedtruths).Mis-conceptions are formed from the ideas\nwhich permeate through the education\nsystem, the media and statements of\npoliticians (spin or propaganda), these\nthen form concepts which become be-liefs. So you go on to believe that if you\nhate what a person says, you will still\nlet him say it, i.e. it\u2019s a concept.\nVoltaire (pen-name of Fran\u00e7oisMarie Arouet, anagram of the Latin\nspelling of \u2018Arouet\u2019), was an Enlightenment thinker whose ideas have\nshaped liberalism and hence capital-ism. Voltaire had a few things to say\nabout economy and trade. Alongside\nother fathers of capitalism like Adam\nSmith, David Ricardo etc., Voltaire\u2019s\nwords have also become sacrosanct\nand worthy of quotation; quotations\nwhich go on to become State laws or\ninstitutions.\nLast Thursday (at a talk organised\nby the Islamic Society), Tarek el-Di-wany (author of \u2018The Problem with\nInterest\u2019) quite clearly put forward\nthe Shariah-based Islamic solutions\nto dealing with economics. Whereas\nstatements of Enlightenment thinkers\nbecome law for capitalists (and then\nget refuted, but we\u2019ll ignore that part),\nel-Diwany showed how statements of\nthe Prophet Muhammad (salla-Allahu\u2018alaihi-wasallam) became law for Muslims, such as using gold and silver as\nmoney.\nThe week before el-Diwany\u2019s talk\nat a talk organised by the Ahlul Bayt\nSociety, Rodney Shakespeare (profes-sor of economics) also exposed the\nfallacy of interest-based economics.\nHe showed that not only does interest-based finance add 50% to the price of\nworld trade, it is highly inefficient. In\nthis case, it is malice (from financial\nauthorities), which prevents the public\nfrom seeing an alternative. I don\u2019t think\nI need to prove to anyone the failures\nof free market capitalism; just ask the\nfamilies who have had their houses\nrepossessed, they\u2019ll tell you. And the\nbankers who used to work for Lehman\nBrothers, they\u2019ll second that opinion.\nCapitalists effectively conclude that\nman does not deserve life unless he\ncontributes to the production of commodities and services. Communists\n(and the different flavours of socialists)\nstrive to achieve real equality through\nthe individuals and deny man\u2019s natural\ninstincts; an impossible hypothetical\nassumption and not an alternative.\nWhat isn\u2019t clear is whether Islamic\n(Shariah-based) solutions will ever be\nseen as an alternative. But how can\nthey be? If a nation is nourished on a\ndiet of ignorance, malice and miscon-ceptions, what would cause an alternative idea to even register?\nThe severity of the economic crisis\nshould remove the blinkers from those\nwho unthinkingly assume capitalism\nor communism are the only valid systems out there.\n\u201cIf a nation\nis nourished\non a diet of\nignorance,\nmalice and\nmisconceptions,\nwhat would\ncause an\nalternative\nidea to even\nregister?\u201d\nI\ndon\u2019t own a hat. I never have.\nPartly because the size and\nshape of my skull makes any sort\nof cranial accessory irredeem-ably silly and partly because I\nwas brought up in a household where\nthe general belief was that the sort of\npeople who wore hats were the sort of\npeople that needed to. Don\u2019t ask me\nwhat that means; I\u2019m still working on\nit. Suffice it to say that every time some\nform of headgear would find its way\non to the old luscious tresses, spittle\nwould fly, heart rates would rise, and\nmy father would make sure the hat\nwould be ripped from the aforesaid l.t.\nWith almost Sophoclean irony, today\nI remain headbare whereas my father\nowns a dark green alpine homburg.\nWith a feather. My only reason for not\ndisowning him is that he never actually\nwears it.\nIn short, thanks to my monastic upbringing and the elephantine dimensions of my frontal lobe, I have no\nbowler to help me pass unobtrusively\ndown the streets of the City, no boater\nto oversee my footloose frolics through\nthe days of Spring, no top hat for the\ncountless glamorous evenings I never\nget invited to, no beret or deerstalker,\nno fedora, ten-gallon or trilby. My\nknotted and combined locks remain\nvulnerable and open to the elements,\nas Nature doubtless intended.\nNot owning a hat is, in my opinion,\na relatively minor failing. Men without hats have gone on to achieve great\nthings \u2013 albeit with slightly colder ears\nthan their appropriately accoutred\ncousins. At this moment, however, I\ndo wish I owned one. Nothing fancy:\na tricorne or a panama, say; a coronet\nor a sombrero; or, to tread the slippery\nheights of multiculturalism, a Shtreimel, a fez, a busby, a Santa hat or tur-ban. If only I owned one of the above\nthen I would, logically speaking, be in\na position to remove it.\nAs it is, I doff all of my hypothetical\nhats. All of them \u2013 from my kepi to my\nkeffiyeh, my newsboy cap and my mi-tre, my cardinal\u2019s zucchetto, my Native\nAmerican headdress, my mortarboard,\nmy dunce cap and my tam o\u2019shanter.\nTo put an end to this circumlocutory\nnonsense and stop pointlessly flagellating about the shrubbery, may I just say\nthat I bare my head with respect to the\npolitical cartoonist.\nThe political cartoonist inhabits the\ncentre of what must be one of the most\nremarkable Venn diagram layouts\nfound outside of an A level statistics\nmodule exam paper. No one else in any\nof the three professions he belongs to\nneeds to work so hard on the fast sell.\nNo artist needs to capture a moment\nin time so economically; no international analyst is expected to make his\ncommentary fit in a blank space left\nover between a crossword and a fashion review, and no humourist needs to\nget a topical joke across in the fraction\nof a second reserved for the cartoonist.\nGranted, an image is worth a thousand\nwords: but according to that exchange\nrate a single line drawn by David Low,\nSidney Strube or Ranan Lurie is worth\nten to a hundred of your Earth words.\nWhen was the last time you were able\nto draw a line that conveyed as much?\nWhen was the last time you were able\nto write a line that conveyed as much?\nCertain moments that have occurred\nwithin my lifetime \u2013 certain attitudes,\nsentiments and atmospheres \u2013 will forever be represented in my mind by a\npolitical cartoon. Anyone unfortunate\nenough to have taken the tube with me\nover the past year and a half will have\nfelt me pin their struggling arm to the\nside of the carriage, seen me gleam at\nthem with my wild and bloodshot eyes\nand have experienced my helpful gesticulations as I attempted to recreate\nfor them what has to be my favourite\n21st Century cartoon thus far.\nA rendering of a work of art in any\nother medium is always bound to be\nmassively anticlimactic. And while I\nam sorely tempted to embark on a verbal description of page after page of\nmy favourite political caricatures, I will\nlimit myself to this one.\nMorten Morland, drawing for The\nTimes four days after the 7.7 bomb-ings, depicted a Muslim man in religious dress, with a white tunic, a beige\ntaqiyah cap and a long black beard\nnervously perched at one end of a row\nof seats in the Tube. At the other end\nof the carriage, passengers are huddled\ntogether for protection, shivering with\nfear, holding their newspapers up over\ntheir faces as makeshift shields. In the\ncavernous empty space between them\nare written the three words: Mind the\nGap...\nThe build up to the First World War\nfor me will always be summed up by\nTenniel\u2019s \u2018Dropping the Pilot\u2019 and\nFrancis Caruthers Gould\u2019s \u2018The Holiday Season AD 1914\u201d, with a skeleton\nking wrapped in a thin sheet, emerging from his coffin-shaped caravan to\ntake a brisk swim in a river of blood.\nDavid Low is the Second World War in\nmy eyes, and in the eyes of many who\nlived through it.\nFor sheer succinctness, power and\nhumour, you can\u2019t beat the political\ncartoon. When opening any newspaper that has a cartoonist on staff, examine their work. Those small monochrome or colour images are probably\nthe densest sections of the paper, with\nthe weightiest messages packed into\nthe smallest volume. Simultaneously,\nhowever, they are also the lightest and\nmost easily digestible.\nAngry Geek makes it big, and\nsteps up to defend the cat\nH\nmm? Oh, the sack of\nmoney? Sure, the sack,\nyeah, that\u2019s just my\nGuardian Student Media award, right. Yeah.\nJust a token gesture, you know. Obviously it\u2019s very nice of them, but I\u2019m big\ntime now. I\u2019m co-writing Elton John\u2019s\nobituary and shit like that. Yeah. Yeah.\nSome kid named Rowling came, asked\nme for some tips. Said she\u2019s a big fan.\nYou know how it is. Hell, I don\u2019t even\nwrite this column any more, it\u2019s all\nghostwriters from Fleet Street.\nIf only, eh? Clearly, not much has\nchanged since The Guardian decided\nto bestow upon me a distinctly regular-sized cheque. I mean, the guy who outdid me didn\u2019t get a comedy-sized one\neither, but he managed to bag a lump\nof glass with his name etched into it, so\nI\u2019m a little bitter. But really, things are\nstill the same. Although Tomo Roberts\u2019\nnewfound love of hookers, cocaine and\ninterviews with Time Magazine are\nbeginning to clog up the felix office a\nlittle. Sellout bastard.\nDespite the fact that I\u2019m thoroughly\npleased that felix itself got the recognition it well deserves, I\u2019m feeling a bit\ndistanced from mass media as a whole\nthis week. In between bouts of 2am\nLeft4Dead, I\u2019ve finally chanced upon\nthe superb graphic novel Watchmen,\ndue to become a movie sometime next\nyear. It\u2019s a really gripping work, with a\nlot of plot gubbins that I certainly don\u2019t\nwant to spoil for you. However, I would\nlike to mention one of the enduring\nquestions it poses, about the duty that\nthose in power have to the vast, idiotic\nmasses.\nThe drop in VAT this week was quite\nclearly a very simple attempt to make\npeople feel better. We might be quite\nthick as a public, but we can do basic\narithmetic \u2013 a 2.5% saving on a three\nquid food bill is unlikely to make your\neyes widen and wallet swell, unless you\nhave a bowel condition and a wallet\nmade of sponge. And really like sand-wiches. But subconsciously, we feel\na bit happier. Prices stay steady for a\nmonth or so, no miniature price hikes\non butter and bread and those other\nweird things that newspapers always\ncry about. It was, unusually for the\ngovernment, a good move.\nBut that wasn\u2019t good enough for\nMister Media, because he felt the need\nto explain to everyone that they were\nbeing duped. The Metro, for instance,\ngleefully sprayed their usual standard\nof bile into my lap on the tube this\nweek, declaring that the change would\n\u2018do nothing\u2019 and that it was just a publicity stunt to make people feel better.\nWell bugger me with an egg whisk.\nWe can\u2019t have any of that shit. Making\npeople feel better? When\u2019s that ever\nhelped a society! I mean, it\u2019s not like\nthe majority of people are gibbering\nmorons, entirely guided by the television into a mass panic. It\u2019s nothing like\nthat. I mean, the media\u2019s been calming\npeople down just fine, why would the\ngovernment need to start getting in-volved! The bastards! Everyone panic,\nthe government\u2019s trying to make you\ncalm again!\nSo I got angry for a bit, and tore\nthrough a few telephone books, that\nsort of thing. Jeffrey Archer called up\nto ask for me to proofread his latest\nnovel, and I was just really rude to him.\nI feel bad. But then another thought\noccurred to me, as I reflected on the\nlast year of felix and recalled the infamous \u2018gagging\u2019 issue that changed the\nfelix logo to this day. The paper was\nsilenced, ostensibly for the common\ngood, and most us were up in arms\nabout it. Oppression! Gagging! We\nmust dissent! Et cetera.\nSo on the one hand, I\u2019m clearly very\nfrustrated that bearded men in small\nwaistcoats are tapping away and creating panic among a large section of\nthe population. But on the other hand,\nstopping felix from saying what it\nwants feels like the trapping of something very rare and special. Naturally,\nmost of you are extremely condescending about felix anyway, and wouldn\u2019t\nconsider it on the same level as a \u2018real\u2019\npaper, even the toiler-paper-with-pho-tos-on that is The Metro. So maybe\nfor you, the dilemma doesn\u2019t exist. But\nreconciling these two examples was\nhard for me, and remained so until I\nheard news of the Guardian Student\nMedia Awards.\nThere\u2019s a gap that needs to be\nbridged, then, between these two ex-amples. There\u2019s a tendency with felix to\ncriticise it, mock it and generally laugh\nat it. People are very unappreciative of\nthe hard work the editors and writers\ndo \u2013 with myself firmly excluded here,\nas all I do is write eight hundred badly\nstructured words and leisurely email\nthem in once a week, while the real\nwork goes on late into the night in Beit\nQuad. Yet they do this work primarily\nto entertain you, to inform you, rather than from some grab for fame and\nglory.\nI think sometime this year we, as a\nstudent body, should work to free little felix from his ball gag on the cover.\nBecause the wafer-thin sheets of congealed human suffering that are sold at\nnewsstands each day aren\u2019t worth your\ntime; they\u2019re cynicism in ink and paper\nform, a horrific cycle of information\nand misinformation, all aimed at keeping your money and attention dancing\naround. But felix; felix is different. Student are different. And, I hope, you are\ndifferent.\nI\u2019m not, though. So it\u2019s back to writing my autobiography and making top\nhats out of twenty pound notes. Now,\nwhere did I put that acceptance speech\nfor the Nobel...\n\u201cThere\u2019s a\ntendency with\nfelix to criticise\nit, mock it\nand generally\nlaugh at it.\nPeople are very\nunappreciative\nof the hard work\nthe editors and\nwriters do\u201d\nClearly Tomo knew what made a good newspaper\nHe\u2019s angry. And he\u2019s watching you.\nI\u2019m not jealous of Angry Geek. Not even slightly.\n\n"

    "content": "14 felix Friday 28 November 2008\nFamily misery brought to life by stunning verse\nEmilie Beauchamp is not defeated by T.S. Eliot\u2019s emotionally overwhelming play, The Family Reunion\nA\nfter eight years of ab-sence, Harry finally returns to his ancestral\nhome for his mother\u2019s\nbirthday and reveals his\ndarkest secret... only to discover that\nthe family also hides its own demons\u201d!\nSounds familiar? At first sight, such\na play\u2019s plot does seem like a d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu:\nthe eternally-unsolved mysteries of an\nindividual surrounded by even more\nmysterious secrecy. Typically these\nplays evolve into an ascending series\nof discoveries for the trepid audience;\neither well-realized and spectacular,\notherwise rather platonic if the information is not well-disseminated. To\nwhich category does 15-17 - Arts.indd,\nby T.S. Eliot, then fall into? After some\nthought, The Family Reunion ought to\nbe put into the first rather than the second category, but for different reasons\nthen one would expect.\nFor starters, The Family Reunion is a\nverse play. Written in poetic dramatic\nstyle, the lyricism of the lines is spec-tacular. Distinguishingly emotional\ndeclarations are followed by expressive\nand poignant speeches with a surprising array of vocabulary and stance,\nmaking the play anything but platonic.\nIn fact, T.S. Eliot, who was awarded the\nNobel Prize for Literature in 1948, has\nbeen recognized for his Shakespearian dramatic style infused with Greek\ntragedy staging techniques. Therefore,\nhis plays include many choruses and\n\u201capart\u00e9s\u201d, increasing the drama but also\ninforming the audience of important\ninformation taking place outside of the\nscene. While his style is very classical\nand even conservative, Eliot explored\ncommon themes for his contemporar-ies. The play, written in 1939, portrays\nan upper-class family stricken by their\nown misery, a subject of much appeal\nfor all crowds at the time. In this sense,\nEliot used real and accessible settings\nto bring poetry to the wider public.\nWhile T.S. Eliot\u2019s approach seems\nto serve verse drama through the best\nmeans, his style does sometimes become overwhelming, as tirade after\ntirade of over-emotional confessions\nare followed by more theatrical state-ments. At the end of the almost 3 hour\nplay, one can be quite proud to have\npicked up all the clues displayed in the\nexchanges \u2013 and looking around me\nnot all of the spectators had. What is\nmore, The Family Reunion was written\nduring Eliot\u2019s phase of reconversion to\nChristianity and it is only at the very\nend of the play that its true meaning\ncan be understood. This means that\nthe spectator is left in limbo for most of\nthe third quarter of the play and that if\nconcentration is not maintained, many\nhints that are central to the conclusion\ncan be missed.\nIt also means that the play leaves a\ngulf between the worldly matters approached at the beginning and the\nspiritual themes with which it ends:\nlife, death and the passage to the af-ter-life; sins and expiation of sins. Put\nmore simply, many audiences today\nmight not even be interested in such\nmatter: Christian spirituality served\nin dramatic verses... Not for theatre\nnovices!\nHowever, the play is particularly appropriate for those ready for a good\ndose of theatrical discourse. The lead\ncharacters of Harry and his aunt Agatha, played by Samuel West and Penelope Wilton, are fantastic orators, very\nwell-spoken. And verse drama, as one\ncan imagine with the above descrip-tion, is not the easiest dialogue to pro-duce... The rest of the cast is also very\nexperienced and gifted, without which\ntalent the play would not have been so\nwell-realized.\nT.S. Eliot\u2019s unique style makes him\none of the greatest literary figures of\nthe past century. To celebrate the au-thor, the Donmar Warehouse presents\na festival in tribute to him until the\n17th of January 2009. Other plays being staged include his most famous:\nFour Quartets, Murder in the Cathedral, The Cocktail Party and Waste\nLand. Presented as the centrepiece of\nthe festival, The Family Reunion is a\nspecimen of a play worth discovering,\nwith a cautionary label for theatre first-timers. While it cannot be said that the\npiece reflects the society of its time because of its singularity, it presents an\nexcellent picture of how British literature can be diverse and original.\nThe \u201cT.S. Eliot Festival\u201d is on at\nthe Donmar Warehouse until the\n10th of January. Tickets range\nfrom \u00a315 to \u00a329.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 28 November 2008 felix\nWho Saw What?! Banksy, watch out\nCaz Knight discovers another artist to add to her list of favourites at South Bank\u2019s Hayward Gallery\nkeeps his face covered either by averting his face from the camera or donning some tights over his face burglar-style. This down to earth characteristic\npervades in all his pieces right into the\natmosphere of the whole exhibition.\nRhode strives to come as close to his\nart and the process of his art as possible by drawing an object and interacting with it \u2013 \u201cfind a wall and make a\ndrawing without getting arrested\u201d. Here\nis an artist who quite clearly loves what\nhe does, does it for him and has FUN\nwhile he is at it! This truly is something\nspecial in an art world so often dripping with pretension.\nIt is tempting to use phrases like\n\u201cSouth African Banksy\u201d but that would\nundermine Rhode as he achieves so\nmuch more than drawing on walls in\nan interesting way and getting up to\nhigh jinks. This is, without question,\nthe best art exhibition I have seen in\nLondon for as long as I can remember\nand its comparatively small size is perfect and will not leave you drained and\nresentful like a lot of the other larger\nones which just try and cram too much\nin.\nM\ny recent visit to the\nHayward Gallery let\nme experience two\nextremes of art; the\nostentatious and the\nmodest. Paying ten pounds gets you\naccess to both the Andy Warhol exhibit and Robin Rhode\u2019s lesser known one.\nI am a great fan of Warhol\u2019s work, more\nfrom an aesthetic perspective than the\nthemes his work stands for or what he\nmeans by them \u2013 as shallow as that\nmay sound. Warhol\u2019s fascination with\nfame, social issues and interpersonal\nrelationships is a marked contrast to\nGerhard Richter (whose most recent\nexhibition is reviewed here, by me)\nwho shuns interviews and giving psychological insight into his work. The\ngreat, multi-talented Goethe also took\nthis approach and let his art do all the\ntalking instead of him. Tracy Emin, on\nthe other hand, lives on this exhibition\nof personal history and emotion which\nshe intertwines with her art. It is hard\nnot to see a Jocks and Geeks social\nstrata emerging in the art world with a\nsection of artists striving for fame, fortune and recognition and others who\ngo about their business doing art for\nart\u2019s sake.\nBack to my experience of Andy\nWarhol which was predominantly\na homage to the artist rather than\nan exhibition of his works, although\nthere was a wide range of his creations\nincluding never-before-seen photographs and the only ever collection of\nCaz Knight\nArts Editor\nall his films in one space. My ears and\neyes were overloaded with sounds and\ncolour and garish d\u00e9cor only helped\nto highlight the sort of riotous experience which would have been had if one\nwere a regular at his studio the Factory,\nhome to amphetamine use, sexual ex-perimentation, cross dressing, hang-ers-on, silver filled helium balloons\n(one of the best features of the actual\nexhibition) and, of course, Warhol\u2019s\ncreative flow.\nPerhaps it was a clever move by the\nHayward or mere coincidence that\nRhode\u2019s Who Saw Who is situated after the Warhol collection and couldn\u2019t\nbe more of a contrast in experience. At\nleast half the size and devoid of colours\nother than black or white we never\neven get a glimpse of the artist\u2019s face\ndespite him appearing in many of his\nstop-frame photographs. Admittedly,\nit is no surprise that Rhode appears\nmore down-to-earth than one of the\nmost well-known artists of our time;\nmaybe Rhode will reach those epic\nproportions in years to come! My more\ndetailed experience of that subliminal\nexhibition of Rhode is also reviewed\nhere, by me. Again..\nEmilie Beauchamp reports back\nsmugly after missing nothing at T.S.\nEliot\u2019s esoteric and intense The Family Reunion. A far cry from highbrow\nverse, Eddie Izzard\u2019s stand up comedy\nis scrutinised by Thomas Weight, who\nis eager to see whether Izzard is up to\nform after his Stateside tour.\nRight off the\nRichter Scale\nhas used the most basic material available to him: an urban landscape, a\npiece of chalk or charcoal and himself,\nto create still scenes which are often\nfunny and always original. If we look\ncarefully we can see that the objects in\nthese stop-frames (drawn or real) are\ntouched with symbolism; from the use\nof black chalk to the fact that Rhode\nis clad in a white boiler suit with his\nface in a mask in Stone Flag which was\nrealised in his mother\u2019s back yard using a piece of bent pipe and a couple\nof bricks. The urban settings are highly\nreminiscent of London\u2019s own landscapes also prone to gangs, warfare\nand racial segregation.\nA recording of one of his performances sees a work of art in the making:\ncombining his Capoiera skills with his\ndrawing skills as he creates a work,\nslipping in and out of black or white\nshoes made of chalk (a material used\nconsistently in many forms throughout\nmost of his work), crushing them as he\ncreates the picture and then clambering on his hands, lest his feet touch the\nfloor, to the next pair!\nThe smaller, second room, in phase-contrast to the main room, has black\nwalls and a Mussorgsky piano suite\nplaying as part of another one of his\nrecorded performances. The texture\nof his photograph Keys, the lacquered\nblack of the background and his dinner\njacket sleeve contrasted perfectly and\nstarkly to the white, granular surface of\nthe chalk pieces on which he \u2018plays\u2019, is\nnothing short of stunning.\nIt would be possible to take in the\nwhole collection blissfully unaware of\nany \u201culterior motive\u201d or hidden meaning or message in his art were we not\nprivy to the fact he was a half-black\nSouth African who had grown up in\none of the most dangerous cities in the\nworld. (Oh, and the names of a few of\nthe works \u2013 Blackhead, for example \u2013\ngive a very gentle, subtle reminder of\nsome of the themes.) Whereas most\nmodern art strives to ram home a political (or other) message, be as controversial or as overtly emotional as pos-sible, it is very refreshing to see Rhode\nin his own world here as he creates\nsomething he loves.\nA common theme in all his photographs and performances is that he\nR\nobin Rhode: Who Saw\nWho is a cool, calm haven\nabove the jamboree of the\nlatest Andy Warhol exhi-bition. For an artist with\nan aliquot of the fame and reputation\nof Warhol, Rhode certainly goes a lot\nfurther in terms of beauty by his sheer\ninnovation.\nGrowing up as a \u2018coloured\u2019 in Johannesburg, Rhode was exposed to gangs\nand rough neighbourhoods which are\nan influential factor in the aesthetics of\nhis work right down to the simple use\nof colour and materials, urban backdrop and subject matter.\nHere is a collection of Rhode\u2019s work\nfrom 2002 to the present day which\nincludes photography, drawings, performances (recorded) and interesting\noutside installations. The white walls\nmake for a perfect surface on which\nto place his predominantly black and\nwhite pieces and photographs which\nare arranged in islands of nine or more\nwith the effect of a flip book. As our\neyes wander from frame to frame, the\nsense of movement is easily appreci-able. In all these \u2018Storyboards\u2019 Rhode\nStone Flag (2004) \u2013 Part of Robin Rhode\u2019s Who Saw Who at the Hayward Gallery\n\u201cRobin Rhode: Who Saw Who\u201d\nat the Hayward Gallery, until\nDecember 7th. Student entry is \u00a36\n12 felix Friday 28 November 2008\nquency of each colour, whether darker\nor lighter ones predominate and how\nthey are grouped together has a great\neffect on the overall impact the panel\nwill have. Some look \u2018darker\u2019 than others despite the fact each colour\u2019s tonal\nintensity is identical to prevent any one\ncolour standing out.\nFive minutes or less is all that is needed to pace around the space but 4900\nColours II is worth a glance at if only\nto submerge yourself in another bright\nkaleidoscopic environment, hitherto\npossibly immured only with things of\na scientific nature.\nSadly, this article was not published\nin time for you devoted arts fans to\nread before the end of the exhibition\nbut the subsequent Indian Highways\nat the Serpentine from 10 December\npromises to be ground-breaking.\nH\ne is regarded as one\nof the most important\nGerman artists of our\ntime, so it is little wonder that he was selected\nto redesign and reinstall the main\nstained glass window of Cologne Cathedral, which had been destroyed in\nWWII and had made done with a plain\nsheet of glass ever since. Based on his\n1974 painting 4096 Farben (4096 Colours), the abstract design is composed\nof 11,500 individually blown glass\nsquares in 72 colours which fill the\nwindow space. Richter began experimenting with colour charts in the mid\n60s where he used charts from paint\nshops as a basis for paintings made up\nof simple squares of colour.\nAnd so it is also for his latest exhibition 4900 Colours: Version II at the\nSerpentine gallery. The collection has\nbeen specially designed by Richter to\nfit the gallery\u2019s interior layout and wall\nspace, also bearing in mind its tall ceiling to floor windows which provide\na sharp contrast between rural park\nlandscape outside and vivid, Rubikscube like works inside.\nBased on 4900 Colours, the second\nversion was created using the same\ncomputer generated approach to devise how the 100 squares were ordered\nto make up each of the 49 large panels using a selection of 25 colours. All\nthat was left for Richter to do was hand\npaint each square in the prescribed\norder and erect each panel. By rolling a dice the element of chance was\nrelied upon again when deciding the\norder and orientation in which to hang\neach panel. It was during the 60s when\nRichter first started using this-pre-determined colour order to eliminate\nartistic whim thereby bringing all concentration onto what we receive visually as opposed to sub-visually, i.e. hidden meaning or message.\nHis approach rejuvenated the medium of painting in an era where it was\nthought almost extinct. Ever the taciturn artist, reluctant to provide insight\ninto his works, 4900 Colours: Version\nII stays true to his style as it presents\nus with cubes of lacquered colour in\neach panel. It takes a good five or ten\nminutes to warm up and start shirking\nthe idea that these paintings are utterly\ndevoid of imagination and interest given that they are essentially of the same\nthing.\nHowever, if you give it a chance and\namuse yourself \u2013 letting the Imperial\nlogician within take over \u2013by trying to\nfind patterns in colour order and frequency you are definitely getting more\nthan what you didn\u2019t actually even have\nto pay for: the exhibition is free! (In one\npainting he uses three of each colour\nsave for dark green of which there are\nfour squares).\nOf course, there is no defined pattern to find as the colour order was\nrandomly generated, but try all the\nsame. Alternatively find inner calm\nthrough gazing at the colours and use\nit as a new-fangled way of meditating,\njust a suggestion. There is also a certain uniqueness in taking in all this\nloud modern art malarkey, turning\naround and beholding some autumnal\npark scenery better fitted to a Romantic poem.\nOne must also remember that the fre-Sick panoramic view of Kensington Gardens\u2019 Serpentine Gallery, home to 4900 Colours: Version II\nHypnotised by giant Rubik\u2019s cubes\nCaz Knight finds beauty, intrigue and a lot more than meets the eye in Richter\u2019s 49 paint shop colour charts\nIzzy any good after his American tour?\nThomas Weight goes to see Eddie Izzard with high expectations. No cross-dressing this time, though\nE\nddie Izzard is one of the\ngreatest success stories in\nBritish stand up comedy.\nSince his critically acclaimed\nshowsthroughoutthe90\u2019she\nis now one of the few British comics to\nhave made it big in the US, co-writing\nand staring in the series The Riches,\nas well as numerous blockbuster film\nappearances from Ocean\u2019s 12 to The\nChronicles of Narnia. After a five-year\nbreak, he has now returned to the UK\noff the back of a 34 date American tour\nperforming in his new stand up show\nStripped to sell-out audiences.\nMonday night\u2019s show was the first\nin a month-long London stint at the\nLyric Theatre and fans will not be disappointed to hear that Izzard\u2019s original mix of meandering whimsy and\nstream-of-consciousness delivery has\nnot changed a jot. He took to the stage\nwith a roaring ovation from a house\npacked with die-hard fans, though this\ntime not cross-dressing as with previous shows. After the disappointment\nof his last show, Sexie, expectations\nwere high for him to make a return\nto form. After a slightly apprehensive\nstart it seemed that Izzard was a little\nout of touch with his London audience.\nHe is a performer known for his comical take on intellectual subjects, though\nhis opening comments on the recent\nelection of Obama were not only light\non gags but on insight as well. This\nwould be a recurring theme throughout the evening with constant pleas\nthat it is now Europe\u2019s chance to make\na daring and bold change for the better.\nUnfortunately this never progressed\nbeyond the suggestion to \u201cmake shit\nhappen\u201d. It would be interesting to\nknow how different the material being\nused in the London shows is to that in\nthe American tour, as the slightly hesitant delivery would suggest that there\nwere substantial alterations which he\nhas yet to get used to. There was an\nawkward few minutes of empty stage\nwhile Izzard fetched his new iphone,\nto do nothing more than to show off\nits light sabre sound effects. The mention of Darth Vader got a cheer from\nold fans but it did seem to show a lack\nof substantial material from such a veteran comedian. However, as the first\nhalf progressed and Izzard grew in\nconfidence we saw a return to the Eddie we know and love.\nThe second half opened where the\nfirst left off, with much more substantial routines and more challenging\nmaterial. Though there was almost no\ndeviation from the usual themes of an-imals, religion and science, the thread\nof gags flowed and the audience were\ndrawn into the remarkable atmosphere Izzard is capable of producing.\nThis bubble was unfortunately burst\nat one point with some utterly shameless plugging of his recently cancelled\nshow The Riches, co-staring Minnie\nDriver, reminding us that America is\nvery much his home now. His musings\non why God created the world in six\ndays and personification of the appendix were just some of the many true to\nform routines that he is capable of pro-ducing, riffing through these themes to\nconclusions that only he could reach.\nThe show ended with the now obligatory encore that comes with all big\nname stand ups, and though it never\nreached the dizzying heights of his\nlate 90\u2019s peak it is hard not to delight\nin having Eddie back on this side of the\nAtlantic doing what he does best.\nEddie Izzard is performing at the\nLyric Theatre, Shaftsbury Avenue,\nuntil the 23rd December. Tickets\non eBay range from around \u00a31 to\nabout \u00a3300.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Arts\n\n"
