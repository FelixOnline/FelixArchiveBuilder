Stella wants\nto create fun and stylish clothes for\nchildren that still deliver on quality that\nworking mothers expect. McCartney\nexplains that her collection is \u201ca reflection\nof my brand, there are pieces that are\nclassic and very sort of timeless and\nhopefully very chic.\u201d\nS\nome tell me that it is a bless-ing, however when I go\nshopping it becomes my\ncurse. You see readers I am a\ntall girl. I know that I should\nnot be complaining about my burden,\nbut unfortunately the world of the high\nstreet is cruel to us of more-than-aver-age proportions.\nAll I want is a new winter wardrobe,\nyet I know that when I trudge gloomily towards the shops of the high street\nI am to be faced with tops that finish\naround my midriff; skirts and dresses\nthat are way too short; sleeves that\nstop two inches above my wrist and\nworst of all jeans that swing around\nmy ankles. Not only is jean shopping\none of the most painful thing a woman\ncan endure ( a slight exaggeration on\nmy part perhaps but sometimes it truly\nis an awful experience) but for us girls\nwith a lot of leg to cover it becomes a\nfully fledged nightmare. Even if shops\nget the leg length right, whoever designed the trousers in question forgets\nabout the little fact that tall people are\ntall everywhere. There is not enough\nlength from the crotch to the waist\nso they sit unflatteringly low and that\nevery time you bend down little is left\nto the imagination. Oh dear.\nAll I want are a few nice jumpers, a\ndress or two and a killer party outfit.\nIt is all too small, too short or ill fit-ting. And some of it just looks bad. Period. So, alas I step out of the changing\nroom with only a pair of tights to show\nfor my troubles. I wonder if it really\nwas worth putting myself through this\nmental torture.\nHowever dear readers, it is not all\ndoom and gloom, as some shops do indeed cater to the needs of the tall folk.\nThe shop of choice for party wear or\nclassic tailoring is Zara. Their skirts are\nnever too short and they even manage\nto get their pencil skirts to stop Below.\nThe.Knee. Amazing.\nH&M are also quite good at catering\nfor those with a few extra inches, although sometimes their sizing can also\ngo the other way so it\u2019s luck of the draw\nwith them. Recently, skinny jeans worn\na bit too short have been making an appearance and Divided for H&M have\nthem in an array of colours so even if\nthey are too short all is well! Another\nplus for H&M is that it is cheap, so you\ncan afford to have more than one pair\nof these too-short lovelies.\nFor trousers, although it may be\nthe obvious choice, Topshop really is\ngood at catering for the tall women in\nthe world. They have an extensive leg\nlength range on all of their jeans and\nsome of their trousers, and they even\nhave a tall range. There is not much selection but their best selling jeans are\navailable in a leg length of 36\u201d and as\nthe range is designed for tall ladies, the\nproblems mentioned above are dealt\nwith rather well. Thank you Toppers.\nBut I am being selfish here; there are\nother bodily woes that other people\nexperience that have yet to be men-tioned. One obviously is the opposite\nof my problem. Many of my friends\ncomplain of being too short, that their\ntrousers hang on the floor and sleeves\nalso cover their hands with bit of extra\nroom to spare. Embrace this though, as\nyou are lucky enough to be able to wear\nheels in the day and look feminine and\npretty, rather than be mistaken for a\nman in drag!\nNot all is lost as most high street\nshops have an excellent petite range,\nand I have been informed that Miss\nSelfridge has a wonderful one. I believe\nthis since most of their clothes are tee-nyweeny anyway. American Apparel is\nsmock. Evans has recently had a total\nimage overhaul and following in the\nfootsteps of Kate Moss for Topshop,\nthey called in the helping hand of Beth\nDitto, lead singer of the band Gossip. Famously comfortable in her own\nskin, she designed a fashion forward\nrange for the store and even though\nher designs are also available on sale,\nthe brand has kept the style injected by\nthis partnership and the clothes available are now sexy, flattering and femi-nine. There are also many online stores\ncatering for plus sizes.\nNo matter what you have to over-come, next time you are out looking\nfor that new pair of jeans or going-out\nensemble; just remember that hope\nis not lost and the perfect item is out\nthere waiting for you. It just helps to\nknow where to look!\nDo you ever struggle to find the jeans or the top that fits? Gabby Gentilcore scours the\nstreets (and the internet) to search for clothes that fit different shapes and sizes.\nThe designer famous for her wrap dresses\nwas on a sightseeing holiday in Madrid\nwhen she was mugged and had her wallet,\ncash and credit cards stolen. The designer\nwas in Madrid to collect an award from a\nSpanish magazine for best international\ncollection.\nThe luxury French brand will soon be\nopening its doors in London, and will be\navailable in Harrods and Selfridges.\nArmani expands\nGiorgio Armarni is set to make his mark\non the Russian market. The designer\nwill visit Moscow next to hold a series\nof events , including a fashion show and\npresentation of his Autumn/Winter 2009-2010 collection.\nTopshop to take over the world\nTopshop is to open stores in Paris and\nMilan following the success of the New\nYork opening of the British brand in the\nsummer.\nFrom top: Clotheslessness is no longer\na consequence of being curvy. Beth\nDitto will surely find heaven at Evans.\nThe company has recently launched\na line with Beth Ditto contributing\ncreative input. A fellow blogger\nshows the petites how it\u2019s done.\nWhite sheer jersey chemise, American\nApparel; tweed blazer, from a thrift\nstore; leggings, Topshop; patent\npumps, Charles & Keith; necklace,\ncomprised of a random black skinny\nscarf, and a necklace from Siam\nSquare, Bangkok. http://wottoncool.\nwordpress.com.\n\u201cAmerican Apparel\nis for petites, as\nthey go down to\nan XS and as it is\nan American brand\ntheir XS is a British\nXXXXXXS.\u201d\nalso good for petites; they go down to\nan XS and because it is an American\nbrand their XS is a British XXXXXXS.\nTheir clothes are cut very short in\nboth the skirt and leg length so it is\nthe perfect place to stock up on basics,\nand everything is cut so small you\nare bound to find something that fits\nyou well here, even if you are particularly tiny. Internet giants ASOS also do\nmost of their most popular styles in\npetite sizes too, so you really are spoilt\nfor choice! Many shoe shops now stock\nsize 3, so if small feet are the problem\nthen the high street also has that cov-ered. For example, all of Office\u2019s styles\nare available in a size 3.\nThe curvier girl is also being catered\nfor on the high street with retailers\nembracing the plus size woman rather\nthan hiding her away in an ill fitting\nCool Wall\n\n"

It can be\nused as palliative treatment (where\na cure is not possible and the aim is\nfor local control or relief) or as therapeutic treatment (where the therapy\nhas survival benefit and it may be\ncurative). It is used in the treatment\nof malignant tumours where it acts\nas the primary therapy, but also commonly in combination with surgery,\nchemotherapy, hormone therapy or\ntransplantation.\nFundamentally, it is the vital process in the initial destruction of cancer\ncells in the short term. However, at the\nmoment there are problems in that although radiation may be physically directed as precisely as possible, it does\nnot differentiate between healthy and\ncancerous cells. This causes problems\nsuch as nausea, vomiting, skin sores,\nrashes, weakness and fatigue as well as\nharsher side effects caused by longer\nterm radiation such as scarring, and\nfurthermore death of normal tissue.\nThis problem has made the need for\na resolution clear and obvious. Lucky\nnow then, that the team from the University of Pittsburgh in conjunction\nwith the NCI (National Cancer Institute) claim to have found a way to both\nprotect healthy tissue from the toxic\neffects of radiation treatment, and at\nthe same time increase tumour death.\nThey claim to have identified a biochemical signalling pathway that can\nprofoundly influence what happens\nto both cancerous and healthy cells\nwhen they are exposed to radiation. In\nmouse experiments, they found that\nblocking the molecule thrombospon-din-1 (TSP1) from binding to its cell\nsurface receptor CD47 (Cluster of\nDifferentiation 47) affords normal tissues almost complete protection from\nboth standard and very high doses of\nradiation.\nSenior author Dr David Roberts from\nthe NCI stated that despite protecting\nhealthy cells, the new approach does\nnot provide this same level of protection to cancer cells. However, the exact\nway in which normal cells are protected when the TSP1/CD47 cell signalling\npathway is disrupted is not yet clear.\n\u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t believe what\nwe were seeing,\u201d Dr Jeff Isenberg, the\nchief author, said. \u201cThis dramatic protective effect occurred in skin, muscle\nand bone marrow cells, which is very\nencouraging\u201d. He added \u201cCells that\nmight have died of radiation exposure\nremained viable and functional when\npre-treated with agents that interfere\nwith the TSP1/CD47 pathway.\u201d\nDr David Roberts explained, \u201cIn our\nexperiments, suppression of CD47\nrobustly delayed the regrowth of tumours in radiation-treated mice.\u201d Dr\nIsenberg, who published his findings\nin the journal Science Translational\nMedicine, said the treatment should\nbe transferable to humans in as little\nas five years: \u201cThe therapeutic agents\nhave been tested in normal cells from\nA new finding at the University of Pittsburgh offers a therapeutic hope to millions, up to a point\nmice, rats, pigs and cows and in living\nanimals including mice, rats and pigs.\n\u201cHowever, further optimisation and\ntesting of these agents would be required prior to any usage in humans.\u201d\nHe claimed that the drugs had been\neffective on human cells in the laboratory but that toxicology and clinical\ntrials would be needed before it could\npotentially be adopted as a treatment, a\nprocess which could require up to five\nyears.\nDr Ester Hammond, a Cancer Research UK scientist at the University\nof Oxford, commented: \u201cThis work is\nparticularly exciting because it\u2019s a step\ntowards developing drugs that could\nbe given alongside radiotherapy to protect healthy cells, while destroying the\ncancerous ones.\u201d\nBut, as previously mentioned, the\nstudy raises the intriguing question of\nexactly why normal cells are protected\nfrom radiation when this particular\ncell-signalling pathway is disrupted.\nIt is possible that the radiation impairs the immune response to tumours\neven while killing tumour cells, but\nsuppression of CD47 keeps the immune cells safe. Decreasing CD47 levels on tumour cells also could make\nthem more sensitive to attack by the\npatient\u2019s immune system after treat-ment. Or, suppression of injury to\nvascular cells may have the ability to\nimprove blood flow allowing naturally\noccurring anti-tumour immunity to\nreach cancer cells more easily\n\u201cFuture work will undoubtedly shed\nmore light on this and could lead to\nnew treatments for cancer patients,\u201d\nDr Hammond added.\nSo called \u2018miracle drugs\u2019 reported\nParticles injected into the LHC for first time in a year\nNathanLey\nNathanLey Science Editor\non tumours we are doing nothing to\nallay the causes of cancer, nor to address the underlying fundamental\nproblems that remain within the body\nafter therapy which actually have the\npotential to repeatedly create the\nsymptoms and effects (i.e. tumours),\nsuch as the chromosomal transloca-tions associated with multiple myeloma and leukaemia.\nin the press frequently come and go\n(take the example of the curry ingredient Curcumin this week) and as a\nresult we should be cautious. Even in\nthe best-case scenario that the expression of CD47 can become routinely\nreduced by the action of a drug and it\nhas the desired effect, it would hardly\nbe the end of cancer. By reducing the\nnegative points of radiotherapy action\nThe secondary structures of CD47, in all their colourful glory\nA little over a year ago, the world\nlooked to CERN with baited breath\nfor the switch-on many feared would\nspell the end of the universe. The\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) was set\nto recreate conditions at the start of\nthe universe and continue the hunt for\nthe ever-elusive Higgs boson. However, despite the great build-up, the\nstart of the experiment was notably\nlacking in dramatics. The big moment\nwas marked only by a smattering of applause among the scientists at CERN,\nand almost missed entirely by the live\nBBC reporter!\nUnfortunately, the experiment was\ncalled to an end before it even fully\nbegan. The LHC was shut down barely\nnine days after the initial start-up. A\nfaulty electrical connection caused\na tonne of liquid helium to leak into\nthe tunnel from two superconducting\nmagnets. This \u2018quenching\u2019 raised the\ntemperature of the magnets by over\n100K above the required 1.9K and has\ntaken scientists and engineers a year to\nrepair.\nLast Friday marked the first injection\nof particles into the collider since last\nyear\u2019s setback. Beams of protons and\nlead ions were sent clockwise around\npart of the \u2018A Large Ion Collider Experiment\u2019 (ALICE), a 7 km part of the larger LHC experiment. Protons were also\nfired anticlockwise through the LHCb\ndetector, a part of the LHC designed\nto investigate the abundance of matter\nrelative to the amount of antimatter in\nthe universe.\nThis may seem like a very small step\nin the restarting of the experiment\nbut engineers and scientists are wary\nof a repeat catastrophe and are taking\nthings one stage at a time. The beams\nsent around the LHC have shown that\nthe collider\u2019s systems are now working as they should be. The process of\ntesting the collider section-by-section\nis slow but necessary to perform the\ncalibrations required for the smooth\nrunning of the experiment.\nGianluigi Arduini told BBC News:\n\u2018This is a work of synchronisation.\nThe fast magnets must be synchro-nised to accelerate the beam and\ntransfer it from one accelerator to\nthe next and eventually to the LHC,\nwhich must be synchronised to accept it.\u2019\nFor the time being, the protons and\nions are being introduced to the collider at the relatively low energy of 450\nmillion electron volts. When the experiment is fully running, the particle\nbeams will accelerate to and collide in\nBrigetteAtkins\nBrigetteAtkins Science Editor opposing directions at a fraction below the speed of light. The energy of\nthe particles is to be built up in stages\nwith the hope that beams will be accelerated up to 7 billion elecron volts\nby 2011. At this energy, particle collisions will give scientists insight into\nthe first moments after the creation\nof the universe. Many involved in the\nexperiment also hope the end results\nwill provide concrete evidence for the\nHiggs boson, a theoretical particle believed to give other particles mass.\nHolger Bech Nielsen of the Niels\nBohr Institute, Copenhagen remarked\nthat breakdowns at the LHC may be\ncaused by the Higgs boson itself. Theoretically the boson could go back in\ntime and destroy whatever created it,\nleading to a malfunction in the accel-erator. Contrary to this, most scientists\nbelieve the 2008 failure was down to\nmore routine problems with the actual\napparatus.\nThe next step now will be the circulation of a particle beam the full way\naround the 27 km tunnel.\nThis is set to take place in November\nthis year.\nA simulation of a lead ion collision in the ALICE experiment\n\n"

Previous films\nsuch as Twelve Monkeys (1995) and\nFear and Loathing Las Vegas (1998)\nhave demonstrated his potential for\ncreating unusually inventive pictures.\nChristopher Plummer stars as the\nimmortal Dr Parnassus, who lumbers\naround in his \u201cimaginarium\u201d. His assist-ant, Percy (Verne Troyer), is the likeable token dwarf. They are joined by\nhis daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), and\nAnton (Andrew Garfield), who spends\nan irritating amount of time expressing\nhis feelings of love to Valentina- who is\nseemingly unfazed. The imaginarium,\nwhich is a Gypsy-wagon/theatre, is\nmoved from fair to fair, and members\nof the audience are invited to travel\ninto Dr Parnassus\u2019 mind to unleash\ntheir imagination. The party continues\nits routine until \u201cthe devil\u201d comes to\ncollect his winnings (Valentina) from\na wager set between Dr Parnassus and\nthe devil years ago. The unforgiving\ndevil, who is played brilliantly by Tom\nWaits, condemns souls to dullness and\nmonotony, whereas it is Dr Parnassus\u2019\nmission to set them free.\nThe slow starting tale picks up when\nDr Parnassus\u2019 band find a mystery\ncharacter (Heath Ledger), hanging under a bridge in London. After recovering the mystery man, he is later found\nto be \u201cTony\u201d, who joins the crew and\nhelps Dr Parnassus in his battle against\nthe devil. Its not long before Valentina\nfalls for Tony and transforms the party\ninto a tedious love triangle. Oh the\nhumanity.\nThe extremely sad and untimely\ndeath of Heath Ledger is not the first\ntime Gilliam has been unlucky in the\nproduction of one of his films. Gilliam\u2019s ambitious film The Man Who\nKilled Don Quixote, which started production in 2000, had to be cancelled\nafter a series of unfortunate events\n(including the set being washed away\nby a flash flood). The film has now returned to pre-production and shooting\nwill commence next year.\nGilliam was lucky enough to save his\ncurrent production, by cleverly recreating the character in the different\nworlds of Dr Parnassus\u2019 imagination.\nThe three new versions of Tony were\ncast as Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell (All of them donated their\nearnings to Heath Ledger\u2019s youngest\ndaughter Matilda, who was not included in Ledger\u2019s old will). Unfortunately,\nthe sudden character change disconnects the audience from the initial\nTony character and momentum is lost\nfrom an already disjointed plot.\nThe movie would have lost all amiability without the ingenious Gilliam\nStefanZeeman\nStefanZeeman\nA comedy in which people can\u2019t tell lies.\nSounds familiar you say? The Invention\nof Lying takes the plot of Jim Carrey\u2019s\nLiar Liar and flips it on its head by\nhaving the movie\u2019s protagonist, played\nby Ricky Gervais, be the only person to\nbe able to lie in a world of truth tellers.\nOnce he\u2019s invented it of course.\nThe film\u2019s premise is a great one. It\ninstantly conjures up thoughts of the\nhavoc you could wreak if people always took you at face value. \u201cWell you\nsee Professor, I would have met the\ndeadline, but this radioactive dog ate\nmy lab report...\u201d What a shame it is\nthen that the film never lives up to the\nbrilliant concept that spawned it.\nGervais plays the main character,\nMark Bellison, with much the same\nsquirm-in-your seat awkwardness that\nmade his other characters from The\nOffice so popular. Bellison starts the\nfilm about to go on a date with a girl\nthat he knows is far too attractive for\nhim, and with the knowledge that it\u2019s\nvery likely that he\u2019ll lose his job within\nthe next few days. His fortunes take a\ndramatic upturn however when one\nday he manages to \u201csay something that\nwasn\u2019t\u201d as he eloquently puts it. With\npeople never having even considered\nthe concept of someone saying something that wasn\u2019t true, Bellison finds the\nworld is his oyster. He can lie to banks\nto get money, make his friends believe\nhe\u2019s a pirate, and even make a woman\nbelieve that the world will end if they\ndon\u2019t have sex right away. But things become less straightforward for Bellison\nwhen his lying leads to him becoming\nthe figurehead of a new religion, and he\nstarts to attract unwanted attention.\nAnd it\u2019s in these all too brief comic\nmoments that the film fails to live up to\nits potential. Before the concept really\nhas time to flourish it\u2019s brushed aside\nto make way for the custom clich\u00e9d\nlove angle. It\u2019s such a shame because\nThe Invention of Lying has at its heart\nwhat so many mediocre Hollywood romantic comedies lack, a funny concept.\nDespite the slightly lacking script,\nGervais performs brilliantly as the\nbumbling everyman character that he\nhas down to such an art. And whilst\nsome of the jokes fall rather flat, Gervais manages to make you care enough\nabout the main character to forgive the\noccasional dud.\nGervais\u2019 impeccable comic timing\nand a few laugh out loud moments\nmake this a watchable film. However, a\nscript that feels lightweight with a great\npremise which is relegated behind a\nromantic subplot that feels tacked on,\nleaves you with the feeling you\u2019ve just\nwatched a film that could have offered\nso much more but fails to deliver on its\npromise.\nMy favourite\nseason\nEdKnock\nEdKnock Film Editor\nTim Davies\nTim Davies\nA fresh concept is not enough\nfor the new Gervais comedy\nCare for An Education?\nZuzannaBlaszczak\nZuzannaBlaszczak Film Editor\nAt this year\u2019s BFI London FIlm Festival there\u2019s been a fair amount of hype\nabout Lone Sherfig\u2019s new movie coming out in cinemas today and it\u2019s not a\ngreat surprise why. It\u2019s a British pro-duction, with a British cast including\nEmma Thompson (sidenote: when\nasked about the inspiration for her role\nof a strict headmistress she jokingly\nsingled out Hitler). But these are all\nsuperficial reasons for liking a movie\nand thankfully An Education manages\nto warrant its good reviews also on the\nbasis of the movies\u2019 story, directing\nand acting.\nThe film tells one of those coming-of-age tales about living life to the full,\nlying to the parents and, invariably,\nabout making mistakes. But An Education, which is based on a ten page\nmemoir by The Sunday Times journalist Lynn Barber and adapted to the\nscreen by the popular book writer Nick\nHornby has a slightly more refined\ntaste than the usual oversweetened\npopcorn we are served.\nThe action takes place in 1960s England at the moment when Britain was\nstill deciding between the upper and\nmiddle class traditionality of the earlier decades and the liberation brought\nabout by the fun-seeking, rock-and-rolling culture of the 70s. This tension\nbetween the old and the new order is\nat the heart of the film and is very effectively rendered in all of its aspects\n- in the themes, the scenography, the\nexquisite costumes, music score and is\nperfectly portrayed through great acting from all of the cast. The result is\na film with a lot of heart in which the\nstory truly comes alive on the screen.\nParticularly worth mentioning is\nCarey Mulligan\u2019s debut performance\nas the lead protagonist, Jenny. She displays heap loads of charm thus easily\nendearing her easy-to-relate-to character to the audience. But she also does\na great job with the numerous dramatic scenes, proving that she\u2019s a talent\nworth watching out for.\nThere\u2019s no denying that An Education is an extremely well made movie,\nbut I have to warn you that you won\u2019t\nfind any Borat mankinis, light sabre\nfights or Chuck Norris action in it.\nanimations. They can be quite ridiculously self-indulgent at times, but\nthere are many moments of complete\nbrilliance \u2013 the cross-dressed dancing\npolicemen are a brief reminder that the\npython flame is still burning. The inventive sets and costumes also deserve\npraise, demonstrating that Gilliam\u2019s\nmind has no limits. Gilliam\u2019s previous\nfilms have illustrated how he can keep\nan edge on his bizarre stories, which\nthis over-the-top film unfortunately\nlacks.\nF\nirst let me introduce my-self; I\u2019m Ed, a new Film Editor and I\u2019m going to explain\nwhy Autumn is my favourite\nseason (and not just for the\npretty leaves). You can split the year\ninto roughly four parts for films. I\u2019ll\nstart with Winter which is generally\nknown as \u2018Oscar Season\u2019 as the distributors release the main contenders\nfor the coveted \u2018Best Picture\u2019 statuette.\nSpring sees a lull in big studio films\nand an increase of smaller independent pictures fresh from the Sundance\nand Berlin film festivals. Summer is\nof course blockbuster season when\nthere is a notable decrease in quality\nof films but not suprisingly an increase\nof ticket sales. Of course this is a generalisation and the year is peppered by\na continuous stream of comedies and\nsmaller action films.\nHowever, my favourite season is Autumn and probably the strangest time\nin the year for films. With the summer\nrush of mega budget CGI orgies over\nand the Oscar worthy pictures too far\naway, a niche has opened up in the calendar and it\u2019s during this time that an\nodd mixture of films is rolled out.\nThere are the films of well established and respected directors who\naren\u2019t after Oscar glory; Wes Anderson and Terry Gilliam have already\nrevealed their latest masterpieces and\nwe have Spike Jonze\u2019s Where the Wild\nThings Are and James Cameron\u2019s first\nfilm in eleven years, Avatar to look\nforward to. \u2018Indie\u2019 films make their\nmark too; An Education (released\ntoday), Paper Heart and We Live In\nPublic have all been raved about by\ncritics. Distributors also feel this is the\nright time to import some edgy films\nfrom Asia; we\u2019ve already enjoyed Park\nChan-wook\u2019s latest, Thirst and controversial filmmaker Sion Sono\u2019s new film\nLove Exposure is out soon.\nIt\u2019s this massive variety of cinematic\ngold which excites me everytime during Autumn. Naturally there are still\nshockers pushed out of the summer\nschedule (Roland Emerich\u2019s 2012 is\nsoon set to destroy some braincells),\nbut I can enjoy a huge range of different films until Oscar season comes\naround again and I feel obliged to\nwatch every Best Picture nomination.\n\n"

That people just\ndon\u2019t appreciate the beauty\nof super-symmetrical string theories,\nor the sublime elegance of a perfect-ly-folded prion? That, in short, the\nworld\u2019s just not damn geeky enough?\nThat, my friends, is because you\u2019re\ndrinking in the wrong pubs.\nSkeptics in the Pub is rapidly becoming a London institution, although\nit\u2019s beginning to spread its tendrils,\nwraith-like, throughout the rest of the\ncivilised world. A little like the good\nbit of a conference (the bit where all\nthe boring shit has finished and you\ngo to the bar to argue about the talks),\nit\u2019s an informal monthly bash in a pub\nin Holborn, with a different guest\nspeaker each time. Topics have ranged\nfrom the misuse of scientific claims\nin advertising through to the (appar-ently) rational basis for believing that\nthe world was created in seven days,\nsix thousand years ago, by a bearded\nbloke with a really warped sense of\nhumour (presented by the UK head of\nAnswers in Genesis). All this is aided\nand abetted by epic measures of beer\nand silliness and whipped into some\nform of shape by regular comp\u00e8re Matt\nParker, the world\u2019s foremost stand-up\nmathematician.\nAs much as anything, the meetings\npresent a forum for people with no\nformal training who are interested in\nor who interact with science to meet,\ndebate with and get drunk around real\nscientists (that\u2019s us); to prove we\u2019re\nnot all bogeymen (or bogeywomen)\nand to give an insight into what it is\nwe actually do all day. As a result,\nMonday\u2019s talk on \u2018Why scientists are\nstill such a PR disaster\u2019, presented by\nDr Jenny Rohn of UCL and editor of\nLablit.com, had the potential to be\ninteresting - or at least amusingly\nbitter. In the end, technical hitches\nand the obvious nervousness of the\nspeaker meant that the talk itself was\nunderwhelming: it turns out, for ex-ample, that if you ask a seven-year-old\nto draw a scientist, what you get is a\nstereotypical picture that looks suspiciously like Dr Bunsen Honeydew\nof Muppets fame. On the flip side,\nI suspect if you ask the same seven-year-old to draw a Swedish man, he\u2019ll\nhave big eyebrows, a chef\u2019s hat and a\nhabit of shouting \u201cBork!\u201d, so I wouldn\u2019t\ndraw too many conclusions from\nthat. Still, the shortcomings of the\ntalk were more than adequately compensated for by the Q&A session and\nsubsequent good-natured bickering,\nleaving everybody to try and piece together the nuggets of wisdom they\u2019d\naccumulated while six pints down.\nDespite the informal feel and loose\nstructure, the event has pulled in\nsome big speakers since its inception\nin 1999: Robin Ince, Ben Goldacre\nand Tim Minchin are regulars, and\nyou\u2019ll recognise a surprising number\nof academics hiding in the shadows at\nthe back so their students don\u2019t spot\nthem. The group have also formed\nsomething of a lightning rod for campaign groups: the geek army behind\ncampaigns like the libel law reform\nproject provoked by the cases currently faced by Simon Singh and oth-ers. The next event is in Victoria,\npresented by Evan Harris MP on the\ntopic of how science influences government policy (and vice versa): get in\nthere and give him a grilling.\nhttp://skeptic.org.uk/events/\nskeptics-in-the-pub\nCOME TOGETHER\nCHRIS SELF WONDERS: \u2018WHY CAN\u2019T WE\nALL JUST GET ALONG?\u2019\nI\nn recent history science has\nbeen divided into clear cut\nfields, for two main reasons:\nas the breadth of study and the\ndepth of thought progresses, a\nlack of time in one\u2019s life forces us to\nspecialise. The second, and rather less\nromantic reason, is economics. In uni-versities, funding is distributed depart-mentally; unless branded a physicist or\na biologist, no one would know who to\nmake the cheque out to!\nUnfortunately the world isn\u2019t so\nnicely divided, and throughout the\ntwentieth century technological advances drove the scientific disciplines\ntogether. Take computers; to understand how a computer functions you\nneed a working knowledge of both the\nphysics behind the electronic hard-ware, and the extra layer of mathematics governing the way the computer behaves. Now you may be thinking\n\u201cMaths is used in physics all the time,\nwhat is he talking about?\u201d but please\ncalm yourself, I put it to you that this\nis categorically different. I concede\nthat maths is used all the time in phys-ics; however here the mathematics is\nnot simply the formalism of the phys-ics. The mathematics describes a different emergent behaviour that study\nof the low level electronics could never yield.\nThis progression culminated in the\ndevelopment of Complexity theory\nin the 1980\u2019s. This computationally\nheavy scientific framework allows the\ngeneral study of emergent phenomena\nand creates a base from which incredibly complex processes such as those\nin biology or sociology can be studied\nmathematically.\nThis is exciting as it opens such doors\nas the true quantitative analysis of the\nbrain, of human populations, etc. Imagine the time when science will be\nable to discuss emergent phenomena\nsuch as psychological behaviours, psychiatric disorders and, perhaps, even\nour self-awareness and desire to learn\nin terms of underlying elements.\nSince the 80\u2019s cross-disciplinary in-stitutes, the analogue of traditional\ndepartments, have appeared around\nthe world both independent of and\nassociated with universities. Even our\nown fair Imperial is graced by the Institute for Mathematical Sciences opposite the Imperial College Business\nSchool. These institutes facilitate the\ncoming together of scientists and engineers from all fields to tackle specific\nproblems. And this has become very\nmuch the fashion of our era; in the last\n10 years, spurred on by this spirit of\ncooperation, scientists have begun to\nlaunch upon studies of unprecedented\nscale. From the analysis of the epidemiology of the worldwide HIV crisis to\nthe great modern example of interdis-ciplinarity: climate change.\nWhole institutions have been set up\nin this way to deal with specific challenges - Imperial currently plays host\nto 7 not including the IMS, and in\nmy opinion this is a positive step for-ward. We observe the world in terms\nof questions; it\u2019s a fundamental and\nfascinating essence of humanity that\nevery child looks at the world and\nasks, \u201cWhy?\u201d. So why, here at Imperial,\nshould our undergraduate studies be\nso fixed within the classic confines of\na particular discipline? Why shouldn\u2019t\ninterest drive what we learn about?\nAnd why are cross-departmental\ncourses looked down on by students of\nstraight sciences?\nThere are undoubtedly numerous administrative reasons \u201cthe man\u201d\nwould tell you to make this dream im-possible. And many more academic\nreasons that make it undesirable. But\nI beseech you readers to never look\ndown on a science \u201csofter\u201d than your\nown. Mathematics students, put away\nthose scowls of self-righteous disgust\nat the physicists; physicists forget your\ndisapproval of the \u201cfact learning\u201d biologists and biologists question not the\nvirtues of sociology. For to answer the\nbig questions affecting our world, you\nwill have to work together one day.\n\u201c...if you ask a\nseven-year-old to\ndraw a scientist,\nwhat you get is\na stereotypical\npicture that looks\nsuspiciously like Dr\nBunsen Honeydew\nof Muppets fame.\u201d\nThe standard Imperial student after a three hour optics lab\nWise words from McCartney and Lennon\n\n"

For\nexample, when was the last time you\nsaw a small child from the audience be\na fake \u2018sacrifice\u2019 on stage? Or when did\nyou last see a lead singer pick up a hose\nand drench the crowd in what I can\nonly hope was water? Then there was\nthe merchandise gun, shooting band\nT-shirts into the crowd, and the relentless \u2018Hey-Ho\u2019-ing Billie Joe insisted on\nevery time he suspected the crowd of\nbecoming idle. Heck, there were even\nmass singalongs of anything from the\nStones\u2019 \u2018I Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction\u2019\nto the Jackson 5\u2019s \u2018I\u2019ll Be There\u2019, where\nBillie Joe started the crowd off, then\nlistened as all of the O2 arena sang\n(surprisingly in-tune) until we could\nno longer remember the lyrics.\nBut my favourite by far was when\nthe band allowed random audience\nmembers onto the stage to take Mr\nArmstrong\u2019s place as lead singer during various songs. Though none had\nwhat you would call the \u2018X-Factor\u2019 it\nwas all very entertaining in a cringey\nkind of way. The band played a 28\nsong set, including pretty much all\ntheir hits, old and new, and I was\npleasantly surprised to find that\nsongs from their latest album (\u201821st\nCentury Breakdown\u2019) sounded even\nGreen Day @ The O2 Arena\nbetter live than on record. I did,\nhowever, get the distinct impression\nthat the band chose to get all of their\n\u2018must do\u2019 songs out of the way as\nquickly as possible (excepting those\nsaved for the two encores), to then\nhave the freedom of pissing around\nfor the next hour and half. Whilst it\nwas all very entertaining, I did find\nmy attention wandering at times,\nwishing that they would focus more\non their music and less on playing\nwith the crowd.\nLive\nGreen Day\nThe O2 Arena\n23rd October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\n2\n004 may be seen as a year of\ninnovation in hip-hop; Outkast released \u2018Speakerboxxx/\nThe Love Below\u2019 and Kanye\nWest released \u2018The College\nDrop Out\u2019, both albums effectively\ncombining commercial success with\nmusical progression.\nMade up of two of the most eccentric heavy hitters of the hip hop under-ground, Madlib and MF Doom, Madvillain surfaced from underground to\ngain massive critical success from the\nlikes of the New York Times - a rare\nevent for a rap group. Although not as\nwidely noted as those two aforementioned albums, Madvillian give another perspective on the evolution of\nrap music, their view of how it should\nhave evolved. Self-defeating wit instead of self-affirming posturing,\nquirky samples and jazz beats instead\nof pop hooks and 808 kicks.\nMF Doom is arguably the most\ninteresting man in hip-hop. British\nborn, New York raised, he first appeared aged 19 in early-nineties rap\ngroup KMD. After gaining moderate success KMD were dropped from\ntheir record label, for their sophomore\nalbum \u2018Black Bastards\u2019 being too con-troversial. In the same week Doom\u2019s\nbandmate and brother died in a car\ncrash. Doom, disillusioned, withdrew\nAlbums that you should know\nfrom rap, living near-homeless on the\nstreets of NYC. He appeared years\nlater as an underground mc. with a\nmetal mask and a host of alternate\npersonas ranging from a space alien\nto a \u2018Vaudeville Villain.\u2019\nIt\u2019s Doom\u2019s rap style that is most\narresting to a first time listener - he\nraps as if trying to crowbar all his wit\nand wisdom into the spaces between\nthe kick and the snare, all whilst retaining his laid-back cool. Combined\nwith Madlib\u2019s esoteric yet funky\nbeats the effect is fascinating. Lyrical\nthemes are varied, and include MF\nDoom\u2019s annoyance at how his named\nis spelt \u2018All Caps\u2019, and the self-explan-Hugh Crail looks at modern classics that shaped music today\nMadvillain\n\u2018Madvillainy\u2019\nStones Throw\n2004\n:LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTINGS::LISTIN\nFriday Monday\nTuesday\nLISTINGS::\nDJ Hype/Shy FX/AndyC :: Fabric\n:: Drum and Bass\nThe Rakes :: HMV Forum :: Indie\nFrank Turner :: Shepherds Bush\nEmpire :: Alternative Folk\nBowling for Soup :: Roundhouse\n:: Pop rock\nDead Weather & The Jim Jones\nRevue :: The Forum :: Rock and\nroll\nJack Penate :: Fridge :: Acoustic\nindie\nFleetwood Mac :: Wembly Arena ::\nPower rock\nDJ Format & Beardyman :: Scala\n::Funk experimental.\nPassion Pit :: Proud Camden ::\nIndie rock, Electronica\nPsychic TV :: Tabernacle ::\nPsychedelic Experimental\nKaiser Chiefs :: Brixton Academy\n(Concert for CARE) :: Rock\nHandsome Furs & Mothlite :: The\nGarage :: Indie Synth Rock\nThe Hours :: The Hoxton Square Bar\n:: Indie\nClutch :: KOKO :: Death metal\n3 Daft Monkeys :: Luminaire ::\nAcoustic Folk\nGotthard :: The Garage :: Swiss\nHard Rock\nSaturday\nSunday\nBilly Talent :: Brixton academy ::\nAlternative rock\nMarc Almond :: Roundhouse ::\nCabaret\nHome Grown :: O2 Islington\nAcademy :: American Rock\nAmon Amarth :: KOKO :: Heavy\nMetal\nWednesday\nA-Ha :: The O2 Arena :: Pop\nGuilty Ones :: Monto Water Rats ::\nAlternative\nAlphabeat :: Heaven :: Pop\nCold Cave :: Barfly :: Experimental\nSynthpop\nThe Phantom Band :: The Boarderline\n:: Indie Rock\nJay-Z :: Alexandra Palace :: Hip-Hop\nThursday\nRoyksopp :: Shepherds Bush Empire ::\nSynthpop\nReverend and The Makers :: The\nForum :: Indie\nMorrisey :: Alexandra Palace ::\nAlternative Jangle Rock\nDaniel Johnston & Laura Marling ::\nBloomsbury Ballroom :: Folk\nEagles of Death Metal & Calvin\nHarris :: Battersea Power Station\natory \u2018America\u2019s Most Blunted\u2019.

In a class not too\nlong ago, I recall my professor briefly\nmusing about Frieze, saying something\nalong the lines of it not being highbrow\nart, but he\u2019d \u2018bought his ticket anyway\u2019.\nSuch a nonchalant view of this event,\nunknown to me, raised questions in\nmy mind of what manifestation it\nwould take: a jumble sale of all sorts\nof bits and pieces, a pretentious circus\nshow of bizarre performances or a stiff\ngallery space of awkward \u2018pieces\u2019 per-haps. My experience of the event was,\nunsurprisingly, a little bit of all!\nThe Frieze art fair first began in\n2003. It is held annually in October in\nRegent\u2019s Park and was primarily set up\nas a fair for selling art. However, the\nlarger majority of visitors now come as\nspectators, including myself.\nThe fair\u2019s main sponsor, Deutsche\nBank, reveals itself almost immediately\nupon entering. The marquee structure\nhoused solid floors and central heat-ing, excellent lighting and even incorporated a stray tree from its host,\nRegent\u2019s Park into a neat little corner\ndining area. The supporting walls for\nthe small clusters of exhibits \u2013 mostly\ndesignated per featured, participating gallery \u2013 were washed with a stark\nwhite, true to the form of the \u2018\u2019cube\u2019.\nVarious media were on display \u2013 blown\nup digital photographs, giant hairy\nshapes of sculpture and even manne-quins, frozen in their own \u2018frieze\u2019.\nAs detailed in the accompanying\nblurb, there were thirty participating\n\u2018territories\u2019, from Australia to the USA,\nfrom Romania to Russia. From these,\nthere were 165 galleries represented by\nover 1000 artists \u2013 some familiar, a few\ndeceased and many unknown.\nOf the participating galleries that\ndrew the most attention, there was\ncertainly a bustle and hubbub around\nthe partition for London\u2019s White Cube\ngallery, which I sensed held a pride of\nplace at the centre of the edifice. Standing brazenly at its entrance was a Marc\nQuinn sculpture of a heavily pregnant\ntransvestite. Quinn\u2019s mastery at taking\nsubjects that society generally feels uncomfortable with and immortalizing\nthem in marble has been seen before\npublicly in London. In 2005 the Fourth\nPlinth in Trafalgar Square was occupied by his statue of Alison Lapper\n\u2013 a fellow artist and friend, who was\nborn with a rare condition, leaving her\nwithout arms and with truncated legs.\nYet instead of initially hailing her as a\nmodern-day Venus de Milo, for surely\none can see the similarities, the public\nfelt uncomfortable with this enlarged,\nserene body, gazing down Whitehall in\nher smooth Carrara skin.\nAlongside Quinn\u2019s sculpture, a few\nother \u2018shock\u2019 pieces were displayed: an\nenlarged interpretation from a Tintin\ncomic page featuring some questionable race and gender exploitations\nas well as a bag of what looked like\nurine on a pedestal. In terms of engaging with the public, only two women\ndrifting around with heavily bandaged\nfaces and hundreds of lines of tub-ing, helping feed one another juice,\nseemed like \u2018entertainment\u2019. Of course\nthis fair is not meant to be a forum\nfor performance and display, yet the\nstatic consumable art object seemed to\nbe dominating the example of gallery\nwork. Surely a commercial gallery, as\na cultural centre, although focused on\nthe sale of artists\u2019 work, one would also\nhope to feature, in a lateral sense, the\nother work of their patronized artists,\nsuch as performance art? Perhaps this\nexpresses the nature of the art market\nand how only if a work is portable can\nit be considered for that market.\nHowever, as if preempting this con-cern, Frieze provides a platform for\nartists to create installation works,\nunder the Frieze Projects arm of the\ngroup and incorporates them into the\nevent itself. One of the most interesting of this year\u2019s events was Monika\nSosnowska\u2019s \u2018Untitled\u2019 \u2013 a \u2018major\nstructural intervention\u2019, a skeletal model of the Palace of Culture in Warsaw to\nbe crashed into the roof of the fair, as\na comment on the \u2018imposition of one\ncultural edifice onto another\u2019, referring\nto the \u2018gift\u2019 of the building to Poland\nfrom the USSR, as described in the\nFrieze catalogue.\nA further benefit to the wealth of\ncultural artefacts available to the people of this country is the Outset/Frieze\nArt Fair Fund to Benefit the Tate Collection. This fund enabled the Tate\ngroup to obtain works of art for the\nfair in order to add to its collection and\nwith time, display to the public.\nFrieze Talks also presents the opportunity for artists themselves to speak\nout about the art market, art works and\nthe voices of the critics about them.\nUnfortunately, we did not manage to\naudit a Frieze Talk, but if I had, I would\nhave chosen artist John Baldessari in\nconversation with curator Matthew\nHiggs. At the Tate Modern there is\ncurrently a retrospective of Baldessari\u2019s\nworks, charting the chronology of his\nartistic career, even the point at which\nhe \u2018cremated\u2019 a period of his works \u2013 a\nsurviving piece of which is displayed in\nthe exhibition as if it were a precious,\nsalvaged artefact.\nThe exhibition space was enormous\nand we did not look intently at every\npiece of artwork, but the sheer volume was not only overwhelming, but\nencouraging also. Not because I necessarily approve of the art market,\nwith its astronomical sums of money,\neven in this time of economic doubt,\nbut because it is pleasurable to see so\nmuch work together in a space, which\nstimulates one\u2019s critical mind and eye.\nI would definitely encourage people to\ngo to Frieze Art Fair 2010 as specta-tors, to see the wealth of artworks being produced globally \u2013 some polished,\nsome unusual, but all artefacts in their\nown right.\nIf you want to know more about the\nFrieze magazine and its events. go to\nwww.frieze.com\nA permanent experience at the O2 worth a mention\nA\nlot of people may not know\nthat there is a new, permanent exhibition at the O2\narena, and why would you,\ngiven its far-flung location in such a\nghastly, white elephant of a building.\nThe British Music Experience is perhaps a preview to what museums and\nexhibitions will be like in decades to\ncome. One is immediately struck by\nhow professional and well engineered\nit is; meticulously laid out as one ascends an escalator right up to its doors\nafter having had one\u2019s Smart ticket\nscanned.\nHowever any tackiness you thought\nyou had escaped appears during the\npreview film which is an utterly cringe\nworthy affair as \u201cTop D-J\u201d Lauren Laverne guides visitors through what is on\noffer in the exhibit.\nThe experience does not get better\nas you enter via a corridor to \u201cscreaming fans\u201d and stadium sounds. But\nonce you go beyond the gimmicks and\nuncomfortable entrance you are left\nfree to explore the truly innovative and\ncaptivating exhibits on show.\nThe dark, exciting room has a definite space age feel to it as a central\nhub is encircled with small rooms,\neach dedicated to small chunks in the\nhistory of British music, beginning\nwith Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly\nin 1945 and extending right up until\nthe present day to Amy Winehouse,\nthrough the eras of Rock \u2018n Roll, Psychedelia, Punk, New Wave and Brit Rock.\nVisitors to each \u00e9poque can marvel\nat original memorabilia, album sleeves,\ncostumes of rock gods as well as interviews with those in the music industry.\nThe most intriguing feature of each\nroom is the interactive history where\nimages are selected and a brief historical tid-bit is projected on the huge\nscreen. Music trivia is mixed in with\nkey contemporary events you always\ntook for granted such as the decrim-inilisation of homosexuality (1967), the\ncriminilisation of racial hatred (1976)\nand the advent of Eastenders to television sets all over the country (1985).\nFor anyone with few inhibitions there\nis a chance to dance your way through\nfrom the Twist to the Macarena in\nthe dance studios where efforts can\nbe recorded and saved by your Smart\nticket, to be collected at a later date\nonline. But the most fun comes in the\nform of the music room where ample\nnumber of electric guitars, keyboards\nand drums are there to be played along\nwith the help of an on-screen tutorial.\nIt would be easy to spend a full day\nthere from when it opens at ten until\nclosing time at eight, such is the extent\nof what is on offer here.\nThe BME has done something truly\noriginal through both its \u201cafter service\u201d\nexperience through its website where\nyou can revisit your experience as well\nas have access to Spotify playlists and\nalso by the fact that this is a non-profit\norganisation whose aim is to advance\nthe education and appreciation of the\nart, history and music in Britain.\nThe relative lack of visitors (making\nfor a calming, unmolested personal\nexperience) is possibly symptomatic\nof its location for anything this good if\nhoused nine miles further west would\nsurely be the most talked about attraction and undoubtedly heaving.\nYou too can experience the British\nMusic Experience at the O2 for a cool\n\u00a312.00 concessions for students.\nNearest tube: Greenwich for the\nO2. Look out for the one-off special\nevents!\n\n"

However as we are in the city I would advise foregoing the wellington boots\nin favour of some flat ankle boots to\npreserve the comfort factor whilst still\ntoughening the florals.\nThis Mitford-esque manner of dressing is not only being seen on the big\nscreen. Not since the Eighties\u2019 Sloane\nRangers has country style been so in\nvogue amongst Londoners- particularly the capital\u2019s youth who seem to\nhave grown bored with urban neons\nand bodycon and are looking for a little\nfarmhouse comfort in the form of dull\ncolours and warm fabrics. East London\nis teeming with Barbour jackets, wool\ntrousers, tweed and the ubiquitous\nFair Isle knit (aka.

Perhaps it is the actresses\u2019 irrefutable beauty and sylphlike figures\nthat pull it together, or maybe the\nreason for this ostensibly unintended charm is the fact that they are\ndraped simultaneously in carefree\nprettiness and complete practical-ity.

Another\nImperial graduate, Jameel Syed joined\nthe company in December 2008 as\ntheir Chief Technological Officer.\nHis background is in the broad and\nemerging field of data-mining. felix\nwas invited to talk to Greg, a Nightlife\nand Music Editor for felix and Jameel,\nabout their business and how they got\nthere.\nWe met at their office where like\nmany start-ups, the atmosphere was\nrelaxed and their expensive hardware\nsat alongside Xboxes and a foosball\ntable. Their clients can be anyone in\nthe music industry, but they mostly\ndeal with medium to large record labels and management firms. They offer software that allows them to access\nrelevant market information.\nI started by asking how Greg\u2019s time\nat Imperial helped him set up his own\nbusiness, beyond the technical programming skills he gained. \u201cIt made\nit easier, definitely, in terms of access.\u201d\nJameel had also benefited from a summer research project in data mining,\nleading directly to his post-graduation\nline of work. They were both excited\nby the increased availability of support\nfor student enterprise in recent years,\n\u201cIt will definitely help.\u201d\nContinuing our series on profiling successful start-ups with links to Imperial College, felix Business interviewed\ntwo former Imperial students about their music industry data-mining company\nmanagers. More importantly, they\nwant to turn their proucts to standard\ntools within the idustry.\nThey already track five hundred\nthousand bands and plan to expand\nthis to ten million. This number includes amateur bands such as those\nin high schools, but is impressive\nnonetheless. They have even grander\nplans for where they want to be in\na few years time. They want to apply their data-mining techniques to\nother industries, believing the scope\nThe Musicmetric team line up; we\u2019re still wondering what the colourful space invaders do in the office though\nConveniently displayed graph\nshowing age structure of fans\nOne of my favourites was their map\nshowing the geographic distribution\nof fans. These allows bands to consider\nhaving a tour stop in a town they were\npreviously unaware of being popular.\nFor example, it turns out that Robbie\nWilliams, whose managers are a notable client for musicmetric, is popular\nRobbie Williams is not just a big client for musicmetric, he is also a personal\nfavourite of felix Editor Dan Wan (Ed. - He\u2019s really not, it\u2019s all about The Barlow)\nin Northern Italy. so he could think\nabout maybe staging a gig there.\nThere are also some altogether cleverer applications of musicmetric\u2019s\ndata-mining technology. They are able\nto, as they put it, \u2018calculate buzz\u2019 and\n\u2018analyse sentiment\u2019. Their software\ngoes through websites, blogs, and other online sources of information. They\ncan then search for anything from the\nnumber of pirate downloads of a particular track to pieces of text. These\ncan, for example, tell if audiences\nthought lighting at a show was bad or if\nthey are keenly awaiting a new album.\nJameel is working on improving their\nproduct line all the time. Their focus\nfor the next couple of years is going\nto remain the music industry. During\nthis time, they aim to provide an even\nbroader range of services to artists and\nMusicmetric currently offers three levels of service to cater for casual, professional and larger clients. The scope\nof applications for their data analysis\nis vast. For example, they can show\ndemographic information to help musicians target their marketing more\neffectively. Greg says that this has become even more important as a result\nof advertising budget cuts caused by\nthe recession.\nMusicmetric\u2019s product line\nMap showing concentrations of fans\nRunning Musicmetric as a business\n\u201cTry and get your friends [on your\nteam]...If you can\u2019t persuade your\nfriends or someone who knows a lot\nabout your idea to join, you know\nyou\u2019re going to have problems,\u201d\nOn this one the main advice was to\nbuild prototypes. The guys admitted\nto not using any of the prototypes that\ntheypitchedtoinvestorswith,because\nthey developed better models. But it\nwas still important to be able to show\nwhat the software can do.\nRaising capital to start a new\nbusiness\nStarting a business with friends\nApplying technical skills\nThroughout the interview, good\nadvice came up for students with\nregards to starting out in business.\n\u201cThe first thing people who come out\nof imperial with, say, a computing\ndegree need to learn is how people\nuse [computing degrees] in the real\nworld to achieve their business needs,\u201d\nsuggests Jameel.\nTop Tips for Imperial\nstudents wanting to\nstart their own business\nThe company started off with little\nmore than an idea and a strong team\nof people dedicated to it.\nThey soon secured a \u00a3400,000 investment and are now entering a second investment round. This will enable them to continue growing and\nto develop their latest ideas. Greg and\nJameel agreed that a good team has\nalways been essential in allowing the\nbusiness to flourish.\nThe staff at musicmetric had a passion for music as well as strong technical abilities, which begged the question of what the balance was. Greg\nanswered, \u201c[the balance between music and technology] is reflected in the\nmake-up of the team. We have three\nfrom more of a technical background\nand three who are more interested in\nthe music industry.\u201d\nAnd how do you know that you have\nthe perfect team? \u201cObviously you have\nto get on; you have to be able to do\nwhat you do,\u201d Greg continued. Jameel\nadded, \u201cThere are challenges that come\nup every day...[as a new start-up] you\ndon\u2019t have a department to deal with it\nso people have to come forward.\u201d\nAlthough Greg and Jameel were very\nhappy with the people that worked at\nmusicmetric, they identified the need\nto keep up with the workload as the\nbiggest challenge for all of them. This\ncan be a frequent issue at start-ups and\nhad been especially significant in recent\nweeks as the firm had come up with a\nnumber of new ideas that needed to\nbe worked on. As Jameel put it, \u201cthere\nare always more good ideas [to follow up on] than hours in the day.\u201d So\nthe Xboxes and foosball table suffered\nthe sad fate of underuse. In fact, they\nidentified the kitchen as their favourite\npart of a homely office because of its\nconvenience.\nAs well as expanding into other sectors in which data analysis can help\nparticipant firms\u2019 performance, music-metric wants to expand by going global.\n\u201cWe have got to move outside of the\nUK.\u201d\nDespite the hard work, Greg and\nJameel both clearly enjoy their work.\nI asked what the best part was. \u201cIn\nthe industry, everyone knows eve-ryone. You can be having a meeting\nand mention you sold something to\nsomeone and then [the people at the\nmeeting] will say \u2018oh cool, he\u2019s my best\nfriend.\u2019\u201d\n\n"

When I was 7 I met a\ngirl named Aisha who introduced Boyzone to me. They\nwere a concoction of pre-pu-bescent dreaminess, tied together with\nharmony and sporting white t-shirts\nand denim overalls. Before N-sync\nstrutted in with their dirrrty bubblegum pop and poor-grade CGI futured-home videos, there was Boyzone. Before Simon Cowell decided to show\nhis potato-sculpted face on screen, re-vealing, like some fantastic magician,\nthe audition process for merry-band-making which was previously hidden\nbehind pages of The Stage, 5 Irish lads\nwere selected to be Boyzone. Before\nthe Internet there was Boyzone. Before\nBarack Obama there was Boyzone.\nAnd they rocked my little world.\nThe first ever live show I ever did see\nwas a Boyzone one. It was in Cardiff\nArena. Aisha, me and her mum took\na train from Bristol to the welcoming arms of a sold out 2000 capacity\ndream-sanctuary where I was to come\nface to face, with my hero. He was almost angelic, perhaps due to the overkill of 100W bulb usage. I look back\nand realise how wrong it was, for me,\nas a child, to count how old Stephen\nwould be when I turned 18, just to\nmake sure he could have his wild marriage way with me yet still not be old-man-creepy and get sent to prison.\nOk, so what if I didn\u2019t know the legal\nage for \u2018love\u2019 was 16, in those days sex\nwas still the icky with the finger going\ninto the hoop made out of the other\nhands\u2019 fingers. But at least I was willing to wait; young girls these days\nwould scratch each other\u2019s eyes out\nwith a good size cactus, or hedgehog,\nto get the 2-finger-deal with Robert\nPattinson, of Twilight fame, or one of\nthe Jonas brothers In my day, it was a\nlittle bit more innocent. As we sat on\nthat train to Cardiff, painting our nails,\nalthough in hindsight, what a retarded\nidea that was; strong fumes in a confined space, we literally counted down\nthe seconds until we would see our beloved Boyzone. There was a moment\nwhen I swear Stephen caught my eye\nand yes, hear these words and laugh;\nit...was...like...he...was...singing...only...\nto...me. Golly. I don\u2019t remember much\nelse, not even my favourite song or\nhow long the set was. Only that me\nand Aisha brought matching Boyzone\ndogtags and thought this was awe-some-gee-wiz-cool. I also remember\nthat the only copy of a Boyzone album\nI had was a tape, with two sides and\neverything; they were called side A and\nside B dontchaknow and it was totally\npirated and sold to my Dad at Easton\nmarket. I always did feel the shame of\nmy non-legit copy.\nI grew up and at the age of 13 rejected\nall my Boyzone love to turn grunge...\nthen slightly goth, then a bit new-age\n80\u2019s finally ending my teenage years as\nvery much 50\u2019s. I denounced ever liking pop music; During the time it took\nme to grow up, Boyzone split up, Ronan declared that life is a rollercoaster\nand Stephen became Prince Charming\nin musical theatre.\nHe also came out of closest, shocking girls everywhere and making me\nquestion how much tail he got in his\nBoyzone years, if any, before he decided to bat for the other team. People named him as a hero for gay rights\nalthough in my opinion being smoked\nout of the closest makes you more a\nhero for battling career-blackmail;\nan epidemic in our times. Since then,\nStephen kept to himself, only releasing\nsingles in sporadic periods of his life,\nbut faithfully did not parade himself in\ncelebrity big brother-stuck-in-a-jun-gle-cootie-love-island. Ok, so he did\ngo on Celebrity Ice Skating, but that\ntravesty was on ITV which is practically like broadcasting in a desert.\nIt was only until last week when his\nname even crossed my mind, and for\nall the wrong reasons. As I did my daily\nbreakfast routine of a cigarette and\nreading Sky news on my mobile phone\nit was announced that Stephen Gately\nhad tragically died on holiday. There\nwere no suspicious causes and an underlying heart condition was suspect-ed. Even though his death has shocked\nand saddened me, I firmly believe that\nit was accidental. However I cannot\nbelieve that Jan Moir of the Daily Mail\nmanaged to squeeze out of her column\na large turd of conspiracy theory about\ndrugs, sexual deviance and full on\ngay-bashing.\nAbdul Hannan questions the Government\n\u201cIt is my view that\nthe government\naim is to engineer\na vocal and\nprovocative rightwing extreme\u201d\n...and not just Question Time.\nI\n\u2019ve been following the drum-rolls in the run up to the debate\non Question Time (with Nick\nGriffin on the panel), and also\nfollowed the media coverage\npost-event. I have to say: I\u2019m not very\nimpressed by the holier-than-thou attitude of MPs and some newspapers.\nNick Griffin went on Question Time\nto argue that he is anti-Islam and not\nanti-black or anti-brown. Griffin was,\nquite rightly, held to task by David\nDimbleby (the host) when Griffin\nsmirked and refused to come clean\non his views of the holocaust. No-one\ntook Griffin to task when he audaciously stated that Islam \u201cordains as a\nreligious duty to murder Jews as well\nas other non-Muslims, that\u2019s in the\nQuran there\u2019s no point shaking your\nhead.\u201d The best that Baroness Syeda\nWarsi could say is that, she\u2019s confused\nas to whether Nick Griffin is a friend\nto Muslims or an enemy? It\u2019s as if it\u2019s\ntaken for granted that what Griffin said\nis an Islamic view found in the Quran,\nbut it\u2019s just \u201cextreme\u201d!\nWe know of Nick Griffin\u2019s and the\nBNP\u2019s anti-Islamic views. Griffin is\na fringe politician who carries little weight or support. Yet it is senior\npoliticians from all parties who are\nprimarily responsible for creating an\natmosphere where it is acceptable to\nattack Islam and Islamic values and\nwho have created the environment of\nanti-Muslim hatred which allow people like Griffin to spout their hatred\nso openly. Their war propaganda, oppressive anti-terror laws and cheap\npopulism over the past eight years\nhas made the British population more\ndistrustful of Muslims than any other\nWestern nation.\nJack Straw MP (a co-panellist) fuelled\nmuch more anti-Muslim feelings than\nGriffin with his attack on women who\nwear the niqab (face veil). Yet, he is using his Question Time appearance to\ncourt Muslim votes. And as Griffin\nsaid, it is Straw who \u201chas the blood of\n850,000 Iraqis on his hand.\u201d\nThe colleagues of Baroness Warsi\nin the Conservative Party have similarly fuelled hatred of Islam. With\nmainstream politicians like Tony Blair,\nDavid Cameron, Michael Gove, Phil\nWoolas and Jim Fitzpatrick, one can\nsee that it is not only the BNP who fuel\nhatred of Islam.\nThe invitation extended to Griffin\nby the BBC and the decision of leading\npoliticians to sit with him illustrates\ntheir hypocrisy. It also shows their expediency over the so-called principle\nof \u2018free-expression\u2019.\nEither Griffin\u2019s views are racist, beyond the pale and should not be condoned (even if he is an MEP) or his\nviews should be entertained, as should\nthose of others whose views are dis-liked. However, we see the same politicians who label Muslims as extreme\nand perverted in their belied for believing in the Caliphate or saying that\nresistance in Palestine is legitimate,\nare the same ones that happily sit with\nGriffin -who leads an openly racist\nparty and whose view on Adolf Hitler\nis that he went \u2018a bit too far\u2019!\nThe very newspapers whose front\npages now despise Nick Griffin are the\nsame ones that increase media profile\nof the anti-Muslim BNP or the English Defence League (EDL) they give a\nplatform to the lies that seek to portray\nIslam as a violent, intolerant and backward religion with very little challenge\nto their lies and false premises. In so\ndoing, it intensifies the atmosphere\nwhich bullies Muslims into apologising\nfor their Islamic values, and demands\nthey embrace Western liberal values\ninstead. This would even resonate with\nthose reading this article!\nIt is my view that the government\naim is to engineer a vocal and provocative right-wing extreme and simultaneously engineer a \u2018Muslim extreme\u2019 that\nwill be used by mainstream politicians\nto demonise Islam and so encourage a\nreformist trend in Islam so Muslims to\naccept British foreign policy.\n\n"

Ignoring the barking dogs, I went down to the beach and\nstared at the purpled sun. The sand was\nsoft between my hardened toes. I turned\nand saw a hippy girl sitting beside my\nclothes. From a distance I could tell that\nshe was a life long hippie, who\u2019d long ago\nabandoned \u2018Western materialism\u2019. Funny\nI thought, that she was adorned with so\nmany trinkets. We chatted and inevitably our conversation steered round to\nthe fact that I had only a few days left in\nIndia. She looked at me with sympathetic\npity, she\u2019d lived on that beach in Goa for\nalmost 3 years and had no intention of returning to the UK.\n*\nThe plane taxied to a halt on the runway at Heathrow, and the other passengers fidgeted uncomfortably in their\nseats, itching to leap up and grab their\nbags from the overhead compartments.\nI didn\u2019t move, I stared numbly past my\nimpatient companion to the morning\nLondon sun.\nI smelled the air as I exited the plane;\nit was odourless and fresh and walking\nthrough the terminal towards immigra-tion, my flip-flops seemed suddenly ludi-crous; I gazed enviously at the man ahead\nof me, his leather shoes rapping neatly on\nthe laminated floor.\nThe immigration official spied my battered passport with suspicion:\n\u201cHow long were you in India?\u201d\n\u201cTwo months\u201d, I spluttered, choking on\nthe words. Two months, I repeated again\nin my head. I must have been standing there dumb as the official knocked\non the table and told me to move on. I\nlooked down at him again, tripped over\nmy words and shuffled awkwardly away\nto pick up my backpack.\nI let it circle a few times before I picked\nit up. All the places it had been, and now\nhere it was, nearly at the end of the line\nand I just wanted to stretch out that part\nof my life that I could respectfully label \u2018travelling\u2019. I let it circle, around and\naround and imagined what would happen if I left it there. It would circle there\nall day and then be taken into storage,\nand then be auctioned off to some new\nowner, who would take it on a new adventure and maybe I\u2019d meet this mysterious\ntraveller in a gas station in Tennessee.\nThatwearyvoiceinthebackofmymind\ntold me, \u201cthat\u2019s enough, let\u2019s go now\u201d, and\nso I picked up my bag and headed off to\nget a ticket back into London.\n\u201cI\u2019d like a ticket for the Heathrow Express, please\u201d\n\u201cWhere would you like to go, sir?\u201d The\nlady asked rather obtusely I thought,\n\u201cWhere else does it go?\u201d\n\u201cIt only goes to Paddington, sir.\u201d\nA number of thoughts swirled in my\nhead: I imagined all the things that I\nmight have said to an Indian man if I\u2019d\njust had that conversation in a Delhi rail\noffice, instead a weak \u201cthat\u2019s fine\u201d creaked\nfrom my lips.\nOn the train I converted the fare into\nIndian rupees and another wave of depression crashed over me, 1200 rupees\nI thought numbly, my lips trembling at\neach idea that crawled unenergetically\nto the forefront of my mind; 1200 rupees,\nthat\u2019s six nights at the Salvation army, six\nbeers at Leopolds, four days motorbike\nrent, 120 trips on the overcrowded local\ntrains in Mumbai, 1200 rupees.\nI finally arrived in Paddington and\nwaited for the Circle line train to Victoria. It struck me that London was clean.\nLondon, that great big, buzzing city with\nall those taxis busting out those polluting gases; London, with all those people\nevery day not really giving a damn about\nlitter or cleanliness. It was spotless man,\nit was damn, real, bona-fide spotless.\nThe train came and we all filed on po-litely, without drama; the last time I had\nbeen on a train, I had fought on, elbowing\nother travellers out of the way and shouting to my friend to grab my hand so that I\ncould pull him on. He had run along side\nthe train on the platform, leaping up at\nthe last moment and essentially hung off\nthe side of the train, one foot precariously\ninside the carriage, his arm locked onto\nmy arm, until some \u2018space\u2019 mysteriously\nappeared in the train, which allowed him\nto inch his other foot onto the carriage;\nI still held on to him for the entire hour\njourney and we joked that I had his life in\nmy hands.\nI got the train down to Eastbourne,\n\u00a324.50, 2000 rupees, and walked the\nshort walk back to my detached house.\nIt was bright, so bright. The sun blasted\nthrough the clean air - there was no smog\nto dull its brilliance. The air was light and\neasy and suddenly my backpack didn\u2019t\nfeel so heavy. There was only a few hundred metres left to my house and no obstacles in the way. No cows to avoid, no\nheaps of garbage to force a re-route, no\ntopsy-turvy rickshaws to impede my way,\nnot even another human soul. The way\nwas clear, and the air was clear, and the\nsky was clear and I felt good to be home.\n*\nNow, two months later, my alarm rings\nin the morning, around 7 am. I rush from\nthe cold into the hot shower, the exact opposite of bathing in India. As I leave the\nhouse my feet squirm inside their leather\nprisons. The 74 bus to college is spacious\nand cool and clean, but unbearable compared to the trash cans I traversed the\nIndian countryside in. And as I walk\ninto campus, nobody badgers me to buy\nsouvenirs, I don\u2019t have to avoid cows and\nthere\u2019s actually room on the pavement\nbut I know where I\u2019d rather be.\nAnd when I organise my file each\nevening and then do the washing and\ntidy my room I realise how completely\n\u2018real\u2019 life has extinguished the lofty ideals\nof spontaneity, freedom and doing whatever felt good that I held sacred during\nthe summer.\nThe absence of cows in London always makes me feel a little bit sad...\nH\ni I\u2019m Livy, the new travel\neditor for felix. Not sure\nquite how this happened\n\u2013 all a bit of a blur but hey,\nsuck it up. I am.\nAnyway, aptly as I am writing this, I\nam on a train. There are about 40 people\nsitting around me, yet no one is interact-ing. The opposite of the Extra gum flash-dance train- kiss ad, people seem desperate to avoid eye contact. They fidget in\ntheir seats looking at adverts for home\ninsurance; all of course have plugged into\nmusic like some silent disco (I have to admit here \u2013 I am also listening to Panic in\none ear).\nPublic transport seems to me to be the\nonly place where a group of people is in\none space for hours at a time and remains\nlargely speechless. Sure, people in groups\ntalk amongst themselves, but everyone\nseems to be listening \u2013 I have even been\nonce accosted and yelled at by a stranger\nafter leaving a train, due to the volume\nand \u2018sensitive\u2019 topic of a conversation a\nfriend and I had.\nThere is a company based in America\nthat arranges seat placing on airplanes for\nbusiness personal to meet new contacts\nand network during a long-haul flight.\nMore spontaneously, many people start\nup varying conversations at some point\nmid-flight. If the social norm on planes is\nto talk, the same is definitely not true for\ntrains, likewise on the tube and buses. As\nI sit here, I am wondering: why is this?\nApart from bad seating layouts on\ntrains and buses, part of the problem is\nthat people do not want to cram their\nlives with meaningless conversations.\nJust now I watched a blonde woman issu-inginstructionstohermotheronthecare\nof her little son before waving goodbye to\nthem. Since then, the baby has been fed a\nbottle in stony silence. Any talking in between the goodbye on the platform and\nassumed hello at the other end would be\nneedless, so silence ensues\u2013 travelling is\nan odd limbo between two conversations.\nEscape. Maybe this is the real reason\npeople do not talk on trains \u2013 they don\u2019t\nreally want to be onboard. For most peo-ple, travel is a necessary hassle that must\nbe overcome in order to reach a desired\ndestination. The 8 am tube to work\nevery morning is probably not the most\nwanted thing ever. Sometimes though,\nlittle things can happen on that half-hour\njourney that can make your day: someone\ncould offer you their seat (didn\u2019t happen\nto me today), or comment on your outfit (did happen, very old lady liked my\nbracelet \u2013 weird but nice). Little bursts\nof speech with a complete stranger can\nbe exhilarating. There are all kinds of\ninteresting individuals grouped together\nfor a small amount of time \u2013 just to people watch is fun. Once got chatting with\nthe right person, you can learn a lot, often\nwith a new perspective.\nGoing up to Nottingham once, I met\na Australian tattooist who everyone was\nstudiously avoiding due to his ink and\npiercing fetish \u2013 actually he was very\ncourteous, helped me with my bag and\nspent the whole journey talking about his\nlittle son and all his different jobs.\nSo basically I think the actual experience of travel can give you pleasure,\nsomething that can be accentuated if you\nspeak to the person sitting next to you\nnext time you board a train \u2013 try it out.\nSpeaking of which, the grandmother\nstill hasn\u2019t talked.\nRoutemasters are interesting, but they\u2019re just not elephants...\nInterested in joining 1,000 others on the largest student\ncharity hitch-hike across Europe?

    "content": "5\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk NEWS FEATURE\n...THENCRUMBLINGFROMTHEINSIDE\n... BUT THE CGCU IS BEGINNING TO SHOW CRACKS IN THEIR EXTERIOR; CASH IS LOST AT THE BALL,\nVICE PRESIDENT SPEAK OUTS AND GUILDSHEET EDITOR RESIGNS. DAN WAN REPORTS\nC\nity and Guilds College Union is crumbling from in the\ninside, reports felix. Even\nthough Friday\u2019s City and\nGuilds College Union Masquerade Ball cannot be considered a failure\nby any means, it has seemingly brought to light\nmany of the problems surrounding the CGCU\nand its committee. Since the black-tie event was\nheld, there have been strong murmurs of discontent within the CGCU. Senior committee\nmembersoftheengineeringFacultyUnionhave\nspoken out against the current administration,\nwith Guildsheet Editor Lawrence Weetman\nalso resigning this past Wednesday.\nFriday\u2019s Masquerade Ball made an unexpected approximate \u00a37,300 loss, but the finances seem to be just the tip of the iceberg\ncurrently concerning the CGCU Executive\ncommittee. It is seemingly a story of mismanagement that has amounted to the catastrophic financial deficit left in the CGCU\nbalance sheets this week.\nMonths prior to the Ball, CGCU President\nKirsty Patterson proposed New Young Pony\nClub to be the Masquerade Ball\u2019s headline\nact. However, Rikki Norris, her second-in-command and Vice President of Finances\nand Services, was the very first to see cracks\nin the plan. Being the only other financially responsible committee member in the\nCGCU, he quickly distanced himself after\nlearning about the mounting technical costs\ninvolved in bringing the band to the Union.\n\u201cIn the summer when the Ball was being\norganised and Kirsty quoted \u00a35,000 for New\nYoung Pony Club, I thought it could be pos-sible. Once I heard the technical rider\ncosts could be into the thousands rather than the\nhundreds, that\u2019s when I\ntook a step back.\u201d\nDespite Mr. Norris\u2019s\napprehension and disapproval after assessing the feasibility of attaining the band, Miss\nPatterson decided to go\nahead with hiring the act\nfor a total of around \u00a37,000.\nThe rider costs to hire the band\u2019s requested equipment is reported to be around\nthe \u00a32,000 mark. \u201cI advised not to go ahead,\nbut she went ahead against best advice,\u201d Mr.\nNorris also stated. He has also refused to put\nhis name to the final budget requests sent to\nthe Union for the verification.\nTo cover the extravagant expenses, tickets\nwere priced at \u00a338 for a dinner ticket and\n\u00a316 for entertainments. Some have ques-tionedthepriceoftheticketsforbeingtoo\nexpensive for an event held at the Union.\n\u201cEveryone that came left with a smile\non their face,\u201d said Steve Long, Vice\nPresident of Activities of the CGCU. \u201cWe\nweren\u2019t there to make money after all.\u201d\nTo place things in perspective, RCSU\ncharged \u00a335 for dinner and \u00a310 for entertainment passes at last Monday\u2019s Autumn\nBall, an event held at Cocoon: a Mayfair\nrestaurant-cum-bar more familiar with city\nbankers and high-flying businessmen.\n\u201c The circumstances under\nwhich the cash box went\nmissing are hazy, but reports\nhave suggested it was mislaid\nby Miss Patterson.\u201d\nOn top of the cost of the headline act being\nthe main contributing factor to the debatably\nhigh ticket prices, one attendee to the CGCU\nBall poignantly highlighted a further issue of\nmismanagement that ultimately meant the\nBallbecomeanill-definedevent.Sheasked\u201cdo\nyoureallythinkpeoplegotoamasqueradeball\njust for the headline act?\u201d This is a question\nthat the Kirsty Patterson and her CGCU committee possibly should have asked themselves\nbefore booking such an expensive act.\nThe Ball has raised questions regarding\nthe leadership and financial responsibility\nof Miss Patterson as CGCU President. It\nhas been reported that an initial decision\nnot to sell tickets on the door was reversed\nby Miss Patterson a short while into the\nnight\u2019s proceedings. However, this decision\nwas not run by her committee members,\nputting her in sole responsibility for the box\nof money held at the door; it\u2019s purpose to\nhold guests\u2019 wristbands and to collect ticket\nmoney.\nIt came as a surprise for other members of\nthe CGCU committee to hear that the cash\nbox containing a total of \u00a3470 was found in\nthe Union Dining Hall by a Union senior\nsteward at 4pm the next day. Despite immediate emails being sent out by Union Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services) Danny Hill,\nsources have indicated that Miss. Patterson\nonly informed various members of her committee on the Sunday, two days after the\nloss. The circumstances in which the box\nwent\nmissing\nare hazy, but reports have suggested it was\nmislaid by Miss Patterson at some\npoint nearing the end of the night.\nThough the box has now been recovered,\nfelix has since learned that in the weeks\nleading to the Ball Miss Patterson\u2019s privilege to take out the CGCU chequebook\nfrom the main Union offices had been re-voked. This action had been taken on advice\nof the Union\u2019s finance staff. The reasoning\nbehind this is said to be more down to her\ncarelessness in returning the chequebook\nfor safe-keeping, rather than financial irre-sponsibility. There are rumours circulating\nwithin the Union that the level of financial\nresponsibility she holds as a Faculty Union\nPresident is soon to be subject to alteration.\nWednesday saw another blow for the\nCGCU executive committee when Guildsheet Editor Lawrence Weetman officially\nresigned from his post. He issued an official statement laying out his reasons for his\nresignation.\n\u201cThe pressure placed upon me to produce\na forty-page magazine every month and the\ndesire to put more effort into other projects\nhas forced me to regretfully resign from the\nposition of Guildsheet Editor. \u201cGuildsheet\nhas previously been a termly publication\nthat contained an average of 20 to 30 pages.\nIt has been said that the \u201cpressure\u201d in which\nMr. Weetman describes to go to print every\nmonth with 40 pages came from the top, and\nthat a strained relationship with members of\nthe CGCU executive committee were started to become too untenable to do Guildsheet\njustice. I took into account the thoughts of\nmy friends and tutors when making this de-cision, and don\u2019t believe that I really had any\nother option under the circumstances.\u201d\nThe Masquerade Ball and surrounding\nevents have left a disgruntled committee\nwho are seemingly pointing fingers above\nthem towards their most senior mem-ber. The CGCU will look to shake off the\nrecent disagreements, and reshape their\nfinances to accommodate the rest of the\nyear\u2019s planned events. Whether or not the\nCGCU can continue to run smoothly with\na President who has several questions over\nher name is to be seen in the coming weeks.\nCGCU Vice\nPresident of\nFinances &\nServices Rikki\nNorris looks to\nclear his name\nafter the fiasco\nsurrounding the\nCity & Guilds\nCollege Union\n\n"

Putting\nQuestion Time on a\nThursday neatly missed\nthe deadline for me to\nwrite about it for Felix.\nOrdinarily this is hardly a problem,\nbut last week with One-Eyed Nick was\ndefinitely newsworthy. But that really\nis old news now, so anyone who cares\nhas already had long enough to jibber-jabber about it so I won\u2019t waste any\nmore time over it.\nAnyway, there is now only one country left who is yet to ratify the Lisbon\ntreaty, the Czech Republic. Once they\nhave done that there will be much\nless of a chance of the incoming Tory\ngovernment being able to sort out the\nmessy relationship with Europe we\nfind ourselves in. To make matters\nworse the treaty paves the way for the\nposition of a President of the European\nCouncil and the current favourite for\nthat position is everyone\u2019s favourite\nwar criminal Tony Blair.\nFor anyone not in the know, the\nEuropean Council is made up of the\nleaders of the 27 member states of the\nEuropean Nation and the President of\nthe European Commission. Currently\na leader for the Council is selected on\na 6 month rotation with the incumbent\nPresident being Fredrik Reinfeldt, the\nPrime Minister of Sweden, but if the\nLisbon Treaty is fully ratified then the\nposition becomes a position with a 2\nand a half year length term.\nTo become elected President the\nmembers of the Council must vote\nwith a majority for the candidate. The\nEuropean Parliament has no say in\nthe matter. The European Parliament\nwe mere mortals get to vote for is just\nwhere people sit on the gravy train voting on how straight bananas should be,\nand whether we should be able to buy\na pint of beer.\nWhen the members of the Council\nvote for their new President behind\nclosed doors it is undoubtedly a good\ndecision to vote in an easily recognisable person, or as David Milliband recently put it, \u2018someone who can stop\nthe traffic\u2019 upon arrival in Washington,\nBeijing or Moscow.\nThis is especially true after the current President was basically snubbed\non a recent visit to Washington. Frankly nobody can blame Obama for that;\nwhat\u2019s the point in meeting someone\nwho is representing \u2018Europe\u2019 when you\nhave the leaders of the world on speed\ndial?\nCertainly, Blair is recognisable and\nhas the right connections with global\nleaders to make sure the views of Europe are heard in the corridors of pow-er, but let\u2019s take a look at why that is.\nFirstly, he took Britain into 2 wars,\none of which is commonly called il-legal, and while doing it he looked\nmore like George Bush\u2019s lapdog than a\nworld leader. So in essence, Mr Blair is\nrecognisable in the same way as Paris\nHilton\u2019s chihuahua.\nSince handing over power to the\nman who has famously ended boom\nand bust, Mr Blair has been keeping\nhimself busy. Through being an envoy\nto the Middle-East and doing after dinner speeches amongst other activities,\nhe is currently pocketing himself a reported $10million a year, so it seems\nunlikely he wants the position for the\ntiny \u20ac270,000 salary or the chauffeured\ncar or 20 dedicated staff members.\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong and Blair is in fact\nselflessly and bravely putting himself\nforward to take on an undoubtedly\ndifficult and likely thankless job. One\nproblem here is that he isn\u2019t actually\nputting himself forward at all; as of\ntime of writing, Blair is still refusing\nto campaign out of fear that his candidacy will be vetoed and he will be left\nhumiliated.\nOf course it\u2019s not the kind of election which a TV campaign is going\nto help, only people already in power\nget to choose who will be the face of\nEurope for the rest of the world. President Sarkozy was the first to suggest\nBlair for the job, Berlusconi of Italy is\nalso in support of Blair and Chancellor Merkel of Germany isn\u2019t outrightly\ndeclaring who she will vote for but it\nseems likely it will be Blair.\nThe only other person who looks like\nthey are intending on trying to get the\nnew position is the leader of Luxembourg who likes to think he is a heavy\nhitter, but frankly I only found out who\nhe was on Wednesday. In essence, it\nseems their choice is between a guy\nwho no-one has heard of and a war\ncriminal who didn\u2019t bring his country\ninto the Eurozone.\nBasically, Tony Blair, not content\nwith merely ruining Afghanistan, Iraq\nand Britain now has Europe in his\nsights. None of us can do much to stop\nhim but there is a petition at stopblair.\norg which currently has over 42000 sig-natures. I would implore everyone to\nsign if you have a few spare moments.\nOf course the petition is unlikely to influence any of the leaders who get to\nchoose the new President.\nThe main duties of the new role revolve mainly around being the face of\nthe European Union to both the leaders of the world and the general pub-lic. This would seem an ideal role for\nthe man who brought charisma rather\nthan policies.\nSo once the treaty has been ratified,\nas it now seems certain it will, Blair\nwill start pushing himself forward for\nthe job with the people who matter.\nHis position will change from being, \u2018I\nwould do it if asked\u2019, to pretending to\nbe a real promoter of Europe.\nBy now it should be fairly obvious\nthat I am currently against further involvement with the European Union\nand against Tony Blair, so if he gets in\nand I have to write about Blair more of-ten, I will be annoyed. Unless of course\nhe finally gets taken to the Hague and\nstands trial for his illegal war.\nJames Lees\nJames Lees Politics Editor\nMarcus Aurelius: A leading figure in contemporary politics according to Neil\nfelix on objectivity in Politics\nGive instructions to a wise man and\nhe will be yet wiser. Of course at Imperial all men are wise. Or so at least\nthe university league tables would have\nus believe. According to THES \u2013 QS\nUniversity Rankings, Imperial is the\nsixth best university in the world. Yet\nanother league table, not nearly as often quoted by the College nor felix, the\nShanghai Jiao Tong University Ranking\nof World Universities, puts Imperial\nCollege at 27th place. Both rankings\nand all rankings are flawed, riddled\nwith errors and are fundamentally biased \u2013 as many articles and research\npapers have shown. What this correspondent really thinks about university\nrankings he cannot reveal for \u2018journalism\u2019 must remain unbiased which simply is impossible given that everything\nwe hear is an opinion, not a fact and\neverything we see is a perspective not\nthe truth as Marcus Aurelius, Roman\nEmperor, said. However, this piece is\nneither a lecture on Ancient Roman\nhistory nor a rant about league ta-bles. All it proposes to demonstrate is\nthat nothing in this world is black and\nwhite.\nAlas, following on from a previous\nweek\u2019s article \u201cFixing Broken Britain?\u201d\nby Phil Murray it is quite clear that\nwith regards to the Human Rights Act\n(HRA) 1998, a few gaping holes desperately need filling. Before going into\nthe privacy claim made by Mr. Murray,\nconsider first the very dubious nature\nof the Human Rights Act. It matters\nlittle that its title simply rings of \u2018benign\u2019 and \u2018caring\u2019. North Korea\u2019s official\nname is Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, yet most of us know that\nthere is as much \u2018democracy\u2019 in North\nKorea as there is honesty in British\npolitics. In fact, what the HRA has\ndone is to pervert the course of justice\nand prevent it from being done in its\nentirety.\nThere are more than 300 war criminals that are freely walking the streets\nof Britain who cannot be deported because of their human rights. Amongst\nthem is a Zimbabwean torturer, an\nIraqi torturer who worked for Saddam\nHussein, a member of the Sudanese\nmilitia and a Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger\nassassination squad driver. Another\nwas a member of the Sierra Leone\n\u2018Mosquito\u2019 rebel group notorious for\nmurder, rape, looting, burning, sexual\nslavery and forced amputations. In\nApril, four men accused of mass murder in the Rwandan genocide won their\nbattle to stay free in Britain. The four\nare wanted to stand trial for their part\nin the 1994 massacre in which 800,000\npeople were killed in 100 days. But the\nHigh Court ruled that there was \u2018a real\nrisk they would suffer a flagrant denial\nof justice\u2019 if returned to Rwanda. It has\nthus been interpreted that these men\nare more important than the people\nthey killed and what is more; blatantly\ndisregarding the safety of the British\npopulation who are inconveniently\nstuck with the bottom scrapings of all\nhuman dignity. Yet one cannot blame\nthe potential receiving nations. Who\nreally wants their garbage back?\nOr why not take another case where,\nunder the HRA, three prisoners won\nmore than \u00a311,000 in compensation\nafter prison officials deprived them\nof heroin or methadone substitute,\nforcing them to go \u2018cold turkey.\u2019 If it is\nnot clear why this is outrageous, it is\nbecause prisons are supposed to discourage drugs and actively prevent\nthem from entering the estates of\nHM Prisons and private ones. What\nis even more fascinating is that even\nthe likes of \u201cBin Ladin\u2019s Ambassador\u201d\nin Europe, Abu Qatada, must remain\nunder article 3 of the HRA because\nhe would be \u201cill-treated\u201d if he was sent\nback to Jordan. The same man who\nclaimed that fighting jihad, holy war, is\nmandatory for all Muslims and urges\nthem to \u2018terrorise\u2019 non-believers. The\nmost notorious case to date was when\nnine Afghan men hijacked a passenger\nplane and forced it to land at Stansted\nin 2000. They were convicted but later\nfreed on appeal and a hearing later\nruled that under the HRA they could\nnot be deported, in case they faced\npersecution from the Taliban in their\nhome country. The cost of their court\ncases, asylum processing and benefits\ncost some \u00a330 million. They are still\nliving freely in the UK.\nThe simple fact of the matter is that\nthere is now an HRA industry where\nmore than 100,000 law firms are pursuing cases filed by members of the\npublic which include the honest and\nthe criminals, the minorities and ma-jorities. There are even 1,200 specialist HRA lawyers. All of it is paid for by\nmoney from the public coffers at an estimated cost of \u00a3100 million, at a time\nwhen there is not even money to pay\nfor MP\u2019s expenses.\nMr. Murray assumes that because the\nConservatives seek to abolish the HRA\nthey also wish to abolish human rights\naltogether. That is a non sequitur assumption which breaches the logic of\nthe day. The proposed British Bill of\nRights would, to all intents and pur-poses, have the same content as the\nHRA but defined and formalised in a\nmanner which would not pervert the\nentire judicial system and thus preventing ridiculous cases, like the ones\ndescribed in this article, from even\nreaching a formal hearing. Mr. Murray would do well to remember that\nthe anti-libertarian tendencies are of\nthis authoritarian government not HM\nOpposition (though they are certainly\nnot without blame).\nIn 1951 Britain signed the European\nConvention on Human Rights. In 1960\nBritish citizens were able to bring cases to the European Court of Human\nRights. Finally in 1998 the HRA was\nenshrined in British law. Yet one cannot help but to think that justice was\nbetter served prior to this stupendous\nact coming into force, now that not\neven the police dare to put up posters\nof criminals-at-large for it might, shock\nhorror, breach their human rights.\nNeil Dhir\nNeil Dhir\n\n"

Google was\ndefinitely on a roll in the tech\nsector this week with an official video laying out the details of Android 2.0. New to the little mean green\nmachine will be Quick Contact which\nfeatures integrated two way syncing\nand amalgamation of contacts (similar\nto Palm\u2019s Synergy), which will pull in\ncontacts and information from multiple sources into one list. Improvements to the general operation of the\nsystem have also been made across the\nboard including Exchange support,\nsearchable SMS, full multitouch support and a revamped browser UI and\nHTML5 support. Hardware support\nhas also be increased with Bluetooth\n2.1 and multiple screen size support\nincluding WVGA being rolled in.\nGoogle is also introducing a free\nturn-by-turn Sat Nav that it\u2019s building\ninto its Google Maps application. Currently in beta, like all things Google, it\nwill be available on Android 2.0 from\nthe get go. Leveraging other Google\ntechnology it\u2019ll also feature vocal address input and text to speech output,\nso in effect you may end up having a\nconversation with your phone over\nwhere you\u2019re going.\nGoogle is also introducing what it\ncalls layers, which are basically overlays on the map that show pertinent\ninformation. Both satellite and Street\nView are layers, meaning that you can\nget a good view of where you need to\nturn and when you\u2019re at your destination with image overlays. Helpful if\nyou\u2019re going somewhere you\u2019ve never\nseen before. Traffic information will\nalso be available as a layer and will pull\ndata from local sources and from mobile phones using Google Maps. This\nmeans that anyone who\u2019s stuck in traffic and using Google Maps will act as\nan early warning system for everyone\nelse using Google Maps in real-time.\nGoogle also said that it is easy for them\nto add extra layers and there\u2019s always\nthe possibility Google might even open\nup an API for 3rd party layers within\nthe app. I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll see the\nintegration of Google Latitude into the\napp, which would be really useful if you\nhappen to be travelling in a convoy and\nget separated.\nGreat but what happens if the signal\ncraps out on you and you\u2019re lost? Well\nthankfully Google\u2019s thought of that and\nmade Maps cache the route before you\nleave in an effort to alleviate this prob-lem. Of course there\u2019s also a benefit to\nthe streaming maps system and that\u2019s\nyou\u2019ll never have to update the maps\non your device.\nOther platform specific announcements are waiting on device manu-facturers, but Google implied that it is\nworking closely with Apple so it may\nappear on an iPhone near to you in the\nnot too distant future. Whatever happens with regard to cross-platform\navailability, it\u2019s sure put a dampener\non the likes of TomTom and Navigon\nwho have been pushing iPhone Sat Nav\napps for quite large sums of money.\nWhen people are faced with \u00a360 for\nTomTom or a free Google Maps app,\nsupported by search money, that does\nthe same thing, I know which option\nmost are going to choose. The problem\nI foresee here is that Google may end\nup wiping out the competition for GPS\napps on connected devices. Without\ncompetition it would mean we\u2019d have\nto wait for Google to innovate without any real urgency for them to do so.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m stoked to see\nwhat Google\u2019s going to do with their\nnavigation app in the near future, but\nI can\u2019t help but think we\u2019re all going to\nend up losing out in the long run.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor\nWeekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed\nAnother week, another botch-up involving Microsoft. This time it was the\nUK unveiling of Sky\u2019s VOD service Sky\nPlayer for Xbox 360, which suffered a\nfailure to launch on Tuesday. Having\nbeen suspended due to \u2018an unforeseen\ntechnical issue\u2019 after being 6 months in\nthe pipeline, it was major egg on face\nfor both Microsoft and Sky. Sky hopes\nto have the service up and running by\nthe end of the week but I wouldn\u2019t hold\nyour breath on that one.\nThe Spawn HD-720, an ugly yet extremely functional box of tricks, is\ncapable of streaming your console of\nchoice onto your PC, allowing you to\nplay your console anywhere with an internet connection. The first test boxes\nthat have been making their way out\nare LAN only but internet streaming\nshould be available soon. First impressions are that it actually works. There\nis a small lag making some control\nschemes feel a little less precise but it\u2019s\ncertainly a promising start. Imagine\nplaying your Xbox from College or in\nthe Airport waiting for a flight.\nThe US Army has been busy this\nweek too, with helmet mounted radar\nhelping soldiers see who\u2019s creeping up\non them. Being able to see through\nfog, dust and even walls and weighing\nin at no more than 2.5 pounds the only\nproblem I can foresee is the bloody\nobvious radar dish on their heads. I\u2019m\nassuming some miniaturization will be\nput into practice here and if it saves\nlives in a war zone, I\u2019m all for it.\nAndroid also got drafted into the\nUS military this week. Raytheon, the\nweapons specialist, has developed a\nnew Android app called the Raytheon\nAndroid Tactical System which allows\nsoldiers to track the positions of other\nsoldiers and UAVs. This allows soldiers\nto get the tactical advantage of a UAV\nPOV sent straight to their connected\nAndroid device. I\u2019m doubting this\u2019ll\nmake it\u2019s way onto your HTC Hero\nanytime soon, but it can only be good\nnews for Android fans having the US\nmilitary backing the mobile OS.\nL\nast week we reported the release of Dell\u2019s new ultrathin\nAdamo XPS laptop, which,\naccording to the Internet,\nwas due for public consumption last\nThursday. Well, Thursday came and\nwent and unfortunately we\u2019ve all been\nduped as the XPS is very much not\navailable in shops. Don\u2019t worry, we feel\nviolated too. What we can offer you instead is a review of the latest info about\nDell\u2019s size-zero laptop.\nSo here\u2019s what we know. The XPS is\nthe latest model in Dell\u2019s Adamo range\n(the one they never properly show off\nin announcements), which it claims\nfocuses on \u2018design and mobility\u2019. The\ndesign is certainly something else, as\nthe laptop sports some interesting fea-tures. To even get the lid open you\u2019ll\nneed to make use of the heat-sensitive\nstrip which glows and unlocks the case\non contact with your fingers. That\nsaid, it\u2019s actually the only way to get\nthe thing open, so if the battery runs\nout or you\u2019ve just got poor circulation\nyou are essentially stuck with a useless\naluminium slab. Once you\u2019ve tackled\nthis obstacle, you\u2019ll find that the keyboard and screen are hinged not at the\nbottom as is conventional, but more\ntowards the middle, which angles the\nkeyboard upwards. If you had this on\nyour lap you would think this might\nput all the weight on one point and\nmake it uncomfortable, but it turns out\nthat\u2019s not a problem. Oh, did I forget to\nmention that it weighs just 0.68Kg (yes\nthat\u2019s just 680 grams) and is 9.99mm\n(less than a centimetre) thick?\nIf that last line is giving you d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\nit\u2019s because in reality the Adamo XPS\nis Dell\u2019s answer to Apple\u2019s MacBook\nAir, which was famously pulled out\nof a manila envelope upon launch to\ndemonstrate its thinness. The Adamo\nhas slightly superior specs than the\ncurrent generation MacBook Air too,\nwith the option of 1.4 or 1.9GHz ULV\ndual-core processors, up to 4GB of\nRAM, integrated graphics powered by\nan Intel X4500MHD and either a 128\nor 180GB SSD, all stuffed in behind its\n13.4\u201d WXGA LED-backlit screen. On\npaper the XPS certainly matches Apple\u2019s latest generation Air in all but the\nprocessor department, in which the\nAir wields non-ULV Core 2 Duos. The\nXPS certainly has the upper hand in size\nhowever, as its tiny width and miniscule\nweight are both less than half of the Air.\nIf only its price tag had a similar com-parison, because the new Dell will set\nyou back an eye-watering $2,000 (for\na machine that gives you a weak 3.3 on\nthe Windows 7 experience index). This\nreally tends to throw everything into\nperspective when you consider that for\nthe same money you could get the new\nbeefiest iMac money can buy, which\nhas many times the processing power\nand disk space. So, what are we actually paying for? Clearly, Dell thinks that\nwhat we are willing to pay for is the tiny\nsize and weight. But that leads me to my\nnext question: who cares?\nThe heat-sensitive strip, weird hinges and incredible thinness are all very\nnice, but are they really anything more\nthan a few bangles and baubles created to please the gadget loving crowd?\nThe specs aren\u2019t bad for the size, but\nthere are plenty of slightly larger laptops out there that deliver much better\nperformance. At the end of the day, the\nAdamo XPS compromises power for\nstyle and it\u2019s up to consumers to decide whether or not that\u2019s something\nthey\u2019re willing to shell out for. The\nperformance of the MacBook Air in\nthe market suggests that at least some\npeople are, but then Apple products\ndo tend to attract those who like their\ngadgets to look nice. It will be interesting to see whether Dell can replicate\nthe aesthetics-driven success that Apple saw with the Air.\nSamuelGibbs\nSamuelGibbs Technology Editor February the Allerta inPulse Smartwatch is equipped with a 1.3\u201d OLED\nscreen and bluetooth to hook up to\nyour BlackBerry.

However with offensive contributions from the whole Imperial line-up,\nthat was as close as Lincoln would get.\nThe Falcons went on to score 10 runs\nover the next 3 innings, winning 22-11\nand securing the Fall Shield for Imperial in our first ever tournament\nDespite being fatigued from a full\nday of baseball of Saturday, we were\nin high spirits for our Sunday friendly\nagainst the Nottingham Thieves - one\nof the longest established university\nbaseball teams in the UK. Facing their\nstar pitcher, the Falcons struggled to\ngenerate offence.\nHowever Hajime Urata - pitching\nfor the Falcons - kept the game close,\nholding the Nottingham line-up to one\nrun through the first 2 innings.\nThings were looking up at one point,\nwith captain Gary Lam on first base\nlooking to steal second, but he was\ncaught off guard by a pickoff attempt\nby the Nottingham pitcher, showing\nthe Falcons the consequences of not\npaying attention.\nEventually the Falcons managed to\nscore a run in the final innings, with\nsome haphazard but fortunately successful base running from David\nLloyd. However, our relative inexperience against the Thieves led to our\neventual 5-1 defeat. Nonetheless it\nwas a respectable result for the upstart\nFalcons.\nThe weekend saw some great baseball played by all sides. All in all, it was\nan impressive performance by the Falcons, and we hope our first tournament\nvictory will spur us to greater success\nover the coming year and beyond.\nFor those who are interested in joining us, we meet at 1:30pm outside\nBeit Quad every Wednesday and on\nalternate Saturdays. Sessions involve a\nmixture of practices at Hyde Park and\ntrips to Harlington and batting cages\nin Northwick Park. There will be more\nopportunities to play in tournaments\nand friendly matches throughout the\nyear.\nImperial College Squad: S Campaigne, YY Chen, H Cheung, S Dong,\nJ Gibbs, A Krishnan, A Lam, G Lam\n(Captain), C Leung, K Ling, D Lloyd, E\nPun, R Thomas, H Urata, B Wu\nContinued From Back Page\nThe victorious Imperial College Falcons with the BUBA Fall Shield\n\n"

However, the referee did not allow it to flow\npenalising IC for offside and offences.\nConstant infringements eventually occurred and the Medic Fly-Half kicked\ntwo penalties to make the score 0-6.\nDespite the penalties IC began to\ndominate and nullified the Medic attack in every tackle.\nUnfortunately, the physicality of the\ngame resulted in the Medics picking\nup a few injuries, forcing them to use\ntheir bench early.\nThe pressure eventually paid off and\nquick thinking by Freddie Chalke led\nto Charlie Esberger touching down for\nIC\u2019s first points of the day.\nA missed conversion by Dan Godfrey brought the score to 5-6.\nNot long after IC broke the game-line through centre Tom Carroll. After\na series of slick hands and offloads in\nthe tackle Tom Zeal stretched for the\ncorner and just managed to score the\ntry before being bundled into touch to\nbring IC into the lead for the first time\nin the game.\nThe try was unconverted and the\nscore was now I0-6 to IC.\nThe second half began as the first\nended with both teams working to\ntheir limits to gain control of the game.\nClever kicking from the IC halfbacks trapped the medics in their own\nhalf. Their attempts to gain territory\nwere brought back fast by the Back\nThree. IC were fortunate to have been\nawarded a penalty in which Godfrey\nscored to bring the score to 13-6.\nNeeding a converted try to level the\ngame the Medics tried to find a way\nout of their half but we knocked back\nby IC\u2019s defence.\nAfter a few nervous last minutes the\nreferee blew the final whistle to a riveting match.\nHugh Dingleberry played magnificently and the effort he put in during\nthe match rubbed off onto his fellow\nplayers who were all outstanding.\nThe teams meet again after Christmas, which will prove to be a bigger\nspectacle as the medics will look to regain the dominance they have had over\nIC in previous years.\n(Apologies for printing an incorrect\nand impossible Rugby score in last\nweek\u2019s issue - Ed)\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XV 13\nOxford Greyhounds 1st XV 6\nImperial College vs. Medicals battling over a line out in Wednesday\u2019s top of the table clash\n\n"

I decided\nto make a run for home in the honest belief I could make it. However\nI had barley reached Gloucester Rd\nwhen I realized the over estimation\nof my bladder capacity and dashed\nfor the nearest cafe. The cafe was\npacked and already sporting a queue\nso I desperately opted for Starbucks.\nOn arrival I was horrified at the loo\nbeing occupied, so tried pacing, sitting anything to stop the inevitable\nflow. The person inside was taking\na ridiculous amount of time and I\ncould feel the pressure surmounting to near threshold level. Then, a\nhideous relief came, as I finally gave\nup and allowed Niagra to fall, leaving a shameful puddle at my trainer\nclad feet. I left, head down hoping\nto avoid eye contact but I\u2019m sure I\nwas noticed. I am now forced back\nto this same Starbucks by a friend\nand am sure the staff have all heard\nabout my accident. What can I do?\nSandy Sandra\nHi Sandra,\nOh dear, sounds like a terrible episode.\nBe warned any enlightened friends\nwill probably take some enjoyment in\nthis but may stop forcing you back to\nthe scene. There are two Starbucks on\nGloucester Rd so why not try to persuade your friend to frequent the alternative one. Good luck,\nYours, Aunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have recently just shaved one side\nof my head and later on that night\nwhilst going down on my girlfriend i\nnoticed she had an excessive amount\nof pubic hair. Mid oral sex I noticed\nthat the hair was the exact shade as\nmy hair and that she had somehow\nmanaged to ligate my hair with her\nbush. It freaked me out and I had\nto stop. I\u2019d really appreciate your\nadvice on how to deal with the situ-ation, I think it will effect every aspect of our relationship.\nMany Thanks,\nEdge\nDear Edge,\nThis seems like a very bizarre situation,\ndid she notice your realization? It reminds me of a Inbetweeners episode. You\ncould either go with it and maybe buy her\ndashing \u2018merkin\u2019; a toupee for the pubic\narea. However if this all repulses you too\nmuch, I think you have valid reasons to\ndump her. Hope you sort it out\nAunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI have an almost unheard of problem\ndown below. I seem to have been\nblessed with a lot of freckles on my\nclit. They seem to be more and more\nevery day and some are now border\nline mole.\nAre there any cures for this? Also\nhow should I present my problems\nto boy friend?\nPimply Pam\nNow that we have filled a coach of\nwilling RAGgers to get LOST somewhere in the UK, I\u2019ll chat a little about\nour chosen charity for this event. ALL\nprofits through sponsorship will go to\nsupporting their worthy cause.\nEach year RAG picks a handful of\ncharities, which our main support\nthrough collections goes to. This week\nI would like to introduce you to Barnardo\u2019s, a charity which Imperial RAG\nhas supported for the last couple of\nyears.\nThis wonderful charity was founded\nin 1866 by Thomas Barnardo in response to the child poverty he witnessed when he came to London. It\nwas in 1867 that he set up the Ragged School and starting helping the\nabused, vulnerable, forgotten and neglected children of East London and\nhis work still continues today.\nToday, Barnardo\u2019s helps over 110,000\nchildren, young people and their families every year. Like Thomas Barnardo,\nBarnardo\u2019s believe that every child\ndeserves the best start in life and the\nchance to fulfill their potential, regardless of their circumstances, gender,\nrace, disability or behaviour.\nThey use the knowledge gained from\ntheir direct work with children to campaign for better childcare policy and to\nchampion the rights of every child.\n\u201cWith the right help, committed support and a little belief, even the most\nvulnerable children can turn their lives\naround.\u201c\nBarnardo\u2019s is regulated by the Charity Commission. Being a registered\ncharity means that they must always be\naccountable and transparent.\u201d\nRAG Charities Pt. 1: Barnardo\u2019s\nMake sure to read the RAG article\nnext week to find out about upcoming\ntube collection permits!\nHi Pam,\nHave you been sunbathing naked a lot?\nMake sure this doesn\u2019t get out socially\nas this rep will do you no favours. You\nshould definitely get this checked out by\na GP asap!\nBest wishes, Aunty McPickle xxx\nDear Aunty McPickle,\nI was recently attending a friend\u2019s\ndinner party. The evening seemed\nto be going well and I was making\nthe usual supreme impression,\nuntil to my great dismay, the friend\nlet a silent bomb rip. I was given\naccusatory looks from the entire\ntable! I couldn\u2019t exactly blame the\nhospitable friend in question and so\nhumbly but weakly denied it. Now I\nfear my name is forever tarnished in\nthe house hold.\nHandy Harry\nDear Harry,\nYou should have denied more\nvehemently and you would never be\nfaced with this shame.How about\ninviting her to dinner at yours and\nthen playing the same trick!\nYours, Aunty McPickle xxx\nFrisbee; the sport of men and people who can jump really high, and catch too. Pissing yourself is optional.\nAs always, for any queries, remarks\nor questions on how to get involved, email us at rag@ic.ac.uk.\n\n"

So last week you\nmay have noticed that\nwe were recruiting a\nnew puzzles bitch. Well\nyou\u2019ll all be pleased\nto know that not one, but two have\nbeen tracked down for our personal\nuse. The names of these great people\nare Sean Farres and Milli Begum so\nlet\u2019s give them a big hand. I personally\nwould like to thank you both as without you they wouldn\u2019t get done, as you\nsaw last week. If any of you do feel the\nneed to complain about any of the stuff\non these pages, please feel free to fuck\nright off. I\u2019m not going to lie, I have\npretty much had it with people coming up to me and telling me something\nis shit. Well done pal, great input. You\nthink you can do better, or do you have\nany ideas as to how we can improve\nthings? Or better still do you want to\ncome and help out? Oh you don\u2019t do\nyou. Well, fuck off before I punch your\nspine into a fine powder. It may sound\nlike I\u2019m joking, but I invite you to push\nme because, really I couldn\u2019t give a shit.\nThis was particularly evident last\nWednesday night at ACC barnight\n(which this year I do not run, so do\nnot come up to me at any point in the\nevening ever again). Since when does\nan intelligent person ask a question as\nfucking retarded as \u2018Where is all the\nbeer?\u201d Mate, your a cunt. The beer is\nwhere it always is, in the kegs. And\nwhat\u2019s more, the only way the beer will\nget out of the kegs is through the taps.\nSo get in line, shut the fuck up and use\nyour common sense. Nobody is going\nto come and run off with a keg, it\u2019s always going to be there and it\u2019s there to\nbe drunk. You twats.\nFinally to continue my massive rant,\nif I give you \u00a310 and you lose it, I\u2019m not\ngoing to give you another. Neither will\nyour sister, mother or the dirty paedo-phile who lives three doors down. If\nyou are stupid enough to lose it then\nyou should not be broadcasting your\nstupidity to the masses really. If you really do feel the need to, do it preferably\nby writing, then I have the opportunity\nto completely ignore you and throw\nyou badly written ramblings of a sad\nlonely person who pleasures themselves with a cucumber straight into\nthe bin. I think you catch my drift, if\nnot just come down to felix and ask for\na chat. I don\u2019t recommend it though.\nStuff Imperial students like:\n5.

As I said at the\nstart of the year, I do love bit of \u201cIt\u2019s\nRaining Men\u201d and I definitely had\nmy dancing shoes on. So much so\nthat I have taken myself to Hospital\nwith repetitive strain injuries. Not\nreally, but my foot is in PAIN!\nBut seriously, the idea of a bar\nnight is probably one of the best\nthat someone has ever had. Who\nwas sitting in the bar on night and\nthought, \u201cI know what this place\nneeds, beer. Not just a few more\npints, but, like 23 kegs. That should\ndo it. And what\u2019s more, let\u2019s make it\nall you can drink. Actually, charge a\nfiver and we\u2019ll all be laughing.\u201d\nWhoever thought that is a genius,\nand I salute you sir.

Alas,\nwe couldn\u2019t delay these\npages in order to get any\ncoverage in, but judging by the average\nof internet opinion that I can see from\nmy desk in the opulent Felix offices, it\u2019s\nlooking very, very good indeed. Which\nyou probably expected, sure. But man,\nhas it really been a year since the first\ngame? It seems like only a few days ago\nthat we were experiencing No Mercy\nfor the first time.\nIt\u2019s interesting to see a quality game\nbe extended so fast. It\u2019s not exactly an\nepisodic policy, but a year has brought\nmore change to L4D2 than many would\nthink possible. Interesting, particularly\nin the context of this week\u2019s news that\nepisodic content brand Blurst is grinding to a halt. The developer Flashbang, who had hoped to churn out a\ngame every eight weeks as a new business model, this week admitted it just\nwasn\u2019t working.\nSo what is L4D2? A full release, done\nin a year? Or a new, episodic extension\nto L4D? What does episodic mean,\nanyway?\nWhat it might be is a reminder that\nthe wheel might not need to be reinvented all the time. Left4Dead\u2019s core\nis extremely solid, even a year after\nrelease. No need to fuck around with\nsomething like that. Instead, Valve\nadded to it, streamlined it, and put\nmore of the fun stuff in. The base was\nalready there \u2013 what they did was work\nwith it.\nMaybe it\u2019s time to look at episodic\ncontent as a development process rather than a consumer-end experience.\nThe idea that constructing a game is\nabout constructing a solid, reusable\nbase, that sequels can embellish without having to rewrite.\nThe reason the boycott came about\nwith Left4Dead2 was the fact that it\nseemed to be the same game, with\nsome tweaks and additions. Those\ntweaks and additions, it so happens,\nalso include several twists on the original concepts, and a bunch of brand\nnew campaigns. But they\u2019re right \u2013 the\ncore hasn\u2019t changed, because it doesn\u2019t\nneed to.\nWhat would we rather have? Piecemeal additions like Fallout 3\u2019s occasional new level? Or wait twelve\nmonths and get something between\nthe two \u2013 a seriously worthwhile set\nof new features, without insisting the\ndevelopers upgrade their graphics engine and pull a dozen new multiplayer\nmodes out of their arse? I know which\nI\u2019d rather.\nRight. Almost done downloading...\nGames Editor\nMichaelCook\nMichaelCook\nTen Long Years - 2002\nS\nee? Last week I promised\nyou 2002 was a good year,\nand here we are and so it is.\nI don\u2019t know about you, but\n2002 was slap bang in the\nmiddle of a big period of playing games\non consoles for me, and this meant a\nyear of jumping, smashing, running\nand gunning, kicked off in style by the\nsublime Jedi Knight 2 \u2013 Jedi Outcast\n(or Dark Forces III if you\u2019re old/an idi-ot). Rudi has fond memories;\n\u201cThe first meeting with a Dark Jedi\nis one of those iconic gaming moments\nfor me, and the game knew how to\nuse its Star Wars canon to slather itself in atmosphere. Stealing aboard a\ngiant spaceship while it was in dock\nand starting the next level on its bridge\nwhile the hyperspace swirls fill the\nviewports was just great.\u201d\nThat it was. However, a Jedi Knight\ngame was small fry compared to what\nwas to come in the normally quiet summer period. Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind came that June, and changed\nRPGs forever.\n\u201cLike many games, once Morrowind\nmade the jump to \u2018proper\u2019 3D, it\nchanged completely, and was able to\nshow people what it had tried to do\nin previous games. The freedom was\noverwhelmingly beautiful.\u201d\nDespite the hugely successful sequel,\nOblivion, many gamers have never left\nMorrowind, and still mod it into the\nlatest generation, with huge detail and\ngraphics updates, as well as new things\nto do in the expansive world.\nLess than a month after Morrowind\ncame another equally huge game \u2013\nWarcraft III, a game that not only\nspawned an RTS legend, but also\nbrought the Warcraft mythos so far\nforward to allow, one day, for World of\nWarcraft to come into being.\nIt wasn\u2019t a unanimous hit, apparently.\nDan loved it: \u201cWithout a doubt one of\nmy favourite games ever, purely on the\nbasis of the fact that I\u2019m still playing it\nregularly today. It had a fantastic cam-paign, amazing FMVs, and a reasonable storyline, but more importantly\na sense of charm that I found missing\nfrom earlier offerings.\u201d\nWhenFrankSinatrasang\u2018ItWasAVeryGoodYear\u2019,hewassinging\naboutthisone.But,uh,prophetically.Yeah.Let\u2019sgetonwithit,eh?\nConan, however...\n\u201cWarcraft 2 took the piss out of fantasy cliches but Warcraft 3 just embraced them. Did we really need another Tolkienesque fantasy world? No\nwe didn\u2019t.\u201d\nDan apparently won, however, because DotA and its ilk are still being\nplayed today, years on.\nThe GameCube had a few good\nmonths, knocking out the bright and\nbreezy Super Mario Sunshine and the\nlong-awaited Animal Crossing within\na few weeks of each other. Sunshine\nwasn\u2019t loved by all Mario enthusiasts,\nbut it kept Nintendo\u2019s innovation engine going, and was certainly the most\npainfully cheery and bright game\nyou\u2019re ever likely to see.\nAnimal Crossing, of course, was dif-ferent. But Animal Crossing is just different in general. Now on the DS and\nthe Wii, the Sims-but-not game\nof relaxation was a huge hit on\nthe GC, and made 2002 one of\nthe more productive years for\nthe console.\nPlatformers had a good year\nin general, with Mario being followed up by Sly Cooper and Ratchet And Clank, both on the PS2.\nMike talks about R&C:\n\u201cR&C is now best known for\nits ridiculous sequels where\nthey amped up the \u2018destruction\u2019 because they felt it was\nthe unique selling point of the\nseries. Unfortunately,\nthey were wrong.\nFor those that never\nplayed it, R&C was a\n3D, third-person platformer with guns,\nwhere you played\nRatchet, a cat-like\ncreature whose planet\nhad been destroyed\nby an alien race.\n\u201cThe best the PS2\nhad before this was Jak And\nDaxter. J&D was great, but the\ndepth and detail of the worlds blew\nit out of the water. Smothered over this\nis a sharp sense of humour, some genuinely interesting characters, and a great\ncombat system. It is the first and currently only game that I have 100%\u2019ed.\u201d\nThough not as successful, Sly Cooper added a degree of style to the year\u2019s\njump-and-smash games.\nOn the complete other end of the\nhappy-o-spectrum, came the Christmas hit GTA: Vice City. The eight-ies-themed crime spree is one of the\nslickest of the series, with the possible\nbetter of GTA4.\n\u201cThe balance given to the setting, to\nthe era, isn\u2019t so much that it becomes\na stupid parody, but it\u2019s enough that\nyou can switch between laughing at\nit all and actually pretending you\u2019re in\nHawaii 5-0 comfortably. It\u2019s a superbly\ncreated piece of entertainment. Just\nawesome.\u201d\nI\u2019ve also been forced to promise to\nmention No One Lives Forever 2. By\nthis guy:\n\u201cThe graphics were, at the time,\nstunning, with properly cinematic cutscenes that didn\u2019t just feature talking\nheads whose chins moved a bit when\nthey spoke. The shooting was great\nand the variety of weapons and gadgets\nwas intoxicating. Apart from that one\nFUCKING level in India.\u201d\nNovember also saw the launch of\nXBox LIVE, a vast gamers network\nwhich this week opened its doors to\nTwitter, Facebook, Sky TV and more.\nIt\u2019s been the key to Microsoft\u2019s success\nover Sony and Nintendo in the past\nfew years, although it had a relatively\nshaky start initially because of its high\ncost.\nGamecube\u2019s second wind for the year\ncame with Christmas, when Resident\nEvil Zero and Metroid Prime landed.\nWind Waker was around the corner\nfor the US and Europe, but in Japan,\nthat too was released before the\nChristmas period was\nover. Wind Waker is\na fond memory for\nmost gamers, and\none of the real visual\ntreats the Gamecube\nof- fered in its lifetime.\nNext year, though!\nNext year.\nClassics That Never Were: No. 2\nDEAD OR\nDEAD OR\nALIVE\nALIVE\nThe Complete Autopsy Sim\n\n"

I am very excited to be presenting\nyou with some interesting articles this\nweek, in particular those detailing the\ncurrent Ed Ruscha retrospective on at\nthe Hayward gallery, at the hub of creativity that is the Southbank. I managed\nto snag a ticket to an exclusive discussion by the artist and have attempted\nto transcribe this rare opportunity\nbelow.\nMy co-editor Caz Knight and I were\nable to visit the Frieze Art Fair the\nother weekend and I have given my\nvarying thoughts on it, having never\nbeen before. \u2018Tis certainly the season\nfor such art \u2018fairs\u2019 and they are popping up all over the place. Upcoming\nis Zoo and the Affordable Art Fair, so\nlook out for those if commercial art is\nyour thing!\nFor those happy with their fill of art\nfor the week, you might like to cast\nyour eye over Caz\u2019s article from her enlightening trip to the British Music Experience at the O2. Probably more of a\nstep back in time in terms of musical\ngenerations, she seemed to get more\nout of the architectural decor.\nIn the upcoming weeks we will be\nreviewing some more exhibitions at\nthe Tate Modern. There is currently a\nretrospective there of John Baldessari\u2019s\nwork - an artist similar to Ruscha in his\noeuvre. We are also making a beeline\nfor the Pop Life show this weekend,\nalso on at the Tate Modern. There has\nbeen a certain amount of controversy\naround this exhibition - some explicit\nartworks having been removed.\nI intend to investigate this further\nand shall report back on these very\npages!\nThere are certainly some exciting events on at the moment around\nLondon!\nSo until next time, I hope you enjoy\nthis week\u2019s issue and if you would like\nto write for us, please get in touch at\nthe email address above!\nEd Ruscha: Daddy Cool\nCaz Knight is submerged into iconic \u2018standardised\u2019 landscapes\nO\nne can hardly overstate\njust how seminal Jack Kerouac\u2019s On the Road was\nfor catapulting the existence of beat literature into the general\npublic\u2019s eye and for, perhaps, creating\nthe \u201cbackpacker culture\u201d among the\nyounger generation both of his time\nand of ours.\nThe vivid sense of place, excitement\nand freedom in the book is just enough\nto inspire any person to cross the 1,328\nmiles from their home town of Oklahoma City to Los Angeles as Ed Rushcha did. Walking around \u2018Ed Ruscha:\nFifty Years of Painting\u201d, it is easy to\nimagine that if Jack Kerouac were an\nartist instead of author, this is what his\npaintings would look like. It is obvious\nthat for Ruscha, Kerouac has been an\ninfluence in his own right, leading him\nto create his own illustrated version of\nthe beat bible, currently on display at\nthe Gagosian gallery.\nTravel, vast panoramic American\nlandscapes, movies and billboards are\njust some of his muses, themes which\nspan all five decades of his career, reappearing again and again.\nThis \u201crecycling\u201d of subject matter\nis in keeping with how Ruscha himself describes his method of painting;\n\u201cwaste retrieval\u2026.taking things from\nmy past and resurrecting them\u201d. The\nsolid, geometric walls of a precinct\ncomplete with barbed wire so synonymous with the American penitentiary,\nappears several times but ten years\napart.\nThis geometric style of depicting\nbuildings began as early as 1965 in\nLos Angeles County Museum on Fire\nin which the bold, stark colours of the\nbuilding are in sharp contrast to the\nephemeral and delicate reds and yellows of the flames eating into its side:\nitself a comment on his views on such\ninstitutions and on abstractionism, the\nfavoured artistic approach of the time.\nAnother category from which Ruscha\nhas since freed himself from is Pop Art.\nThroughout the Sixties, his work as a\ntypographer for an advertising agency\ninspired him to use simple words as\nthe subject matter for his paintings. He\nreduces them to a series of lines and\nshapes, distorting any meaning previously associated with them.\nHe takes this concept further in\nHurting the Word Radio in which the\nletters are squeezed and bent with\nclamps. Although reusing subject\nmatter over and over, the sheer range\nof styles and features to his portfolio is impressive. From using egg yolk\non satin after tiring of paint to blurry\nblack and grey images painted with a\nspray gun. His \u2018liquid\u2019 images featuring milk spilling, glass breaking or the\nword \u201cOily\u201d in glistened and splattered\nletters, are equally beautiful.\nThroughout his career Ruscha has\nalways been interested in the idea of\nthings. His later paintings featuring\nmountain landscapes are more the\nidea of a mountain, how we think a\nmountain should look like, as opposed\nto the mountain itself. His most recent\nworks include The End, a scratched,\nold-fashioned movie still taken from\nthe end of a movie; lamenting things\nold especially when progression does\nnot bring about changes for the better.\nTaking in his fifty years of work, one\ngets the impression that Ed\u2019s technique\nhas always been mature, always superb\nalthough a definite journey has taken\nplace. The return back to old subject\nmatter acts as a consolidation, an acknowledgment of his past achievements making all his paintings \u2018make\nsense\u2019 somehow. Here is a collection\nwhich will delight anyone, no matter\nwhat level of knowledge for, as the artist himself declares, there is no right\nway to look at any of his paintings.\nB\nOSS, OOF, NOISE, \u2018WOW\u2019.\nEd Ruscha\u2019s visual \u2018burps\u2019 are\nutterly monosyllabic. When\na person confronts any one\nof his \u2018visual noise\u2019 paintings, the\nwords soon contort and change into\ngibberish.\nAcidic colours and huge chunky\nRuscha\u2019s laundry list\nRosie MiltonauditsRuscha\u2019scolourfulmind\ntypefaces literally slap you in the face\nwith their boldness and absurdity. Yet\ntheir effectiveness is in their simplicity.\n\u2018Deadpan\u2019 is how I would describe\nEd Ruscha. I encountered the artist at a\nrare presentation given by him, held at\nthe Southbank Centre, which has just\nopened a retrospective of his work, \u2018Ed\nRuscha: Fifty Years of Painting\u2019 at the\nHayward gallery.\nThe discussion took the form of a\nslideshow, after a flattering introduction from the Hayward\u2019s curator, Ralph\nRugoff. He described Ruscha as an\n\u201cobserver\u201d, in particular of America\u2019s\n\u201cshifting cultural landscape\u201d and \u201cvisual habits\u201d.\nRuscha has often been grouped into\nthe Pop Art movement and many consider him somewhat overshadowed by\nAndy Warhol \u2013 an artist who played up\nto the limelight. Ruscha certainly began with a similar training to Warhol\n\u2013 having worked as a graphic designer\nbefore turning to art \u2013 which explains\nnot only his exploration of words, visual signs, bright colours and tropes, but\nhis ability to see a witty idea behind an\nimage or a word.\nHe himself described his slideshow\nas a \u201claundry list\u201d \u2013 a jumble of different things of varying colours, shapes\nand sizes \u2013 reflecting Ruscha\u2019s graphic\n\u2018smile in the mind\u2019. A monochrome\nphotograph of a woman on a telephone\ntaken by Rodchenko, an exploding apple shot through by a bullet and an alphabet of beetles in pen on paper are\njust a sampling of the visual smorgasbord he presented to us, each with its\nown story.\nObjects inspire Ruscha, more than\npeople. His painted landscapes are\nunpopulated worlds, devoid of peo-ple, yet exploiting, almost forcing out\nthat messiness that lies in between our\nactions and existence. Ruscha likes to\npropose a big \u2018what if?\u2019 with every piece\nof artwork: scenes of gas stations and\nmuseums poised expectantly on their\ncanvases, like stills from a Hitchcock\nmovie, to being set alight and roaring\nwith fire in another frame.\nRuscha likened this aerial distancing and cinematic viewpoint to John\nMillais\u2019 \u2018Ophelia\u2019 of 1850 \u2013 a pre-Raphelite painting which could not\nseem farther from Ruscha\u2019s oeuvre\nand yet in actuality seems justly comprehensible when put alongside the\ncacophony of images that serve as his\ninspiration.\nRuscha, describing each slide, calmly\npaced through his list in his mono-syllabic, dry way and yet the audience laughed at almost every image.\nWhether funny or not, it seemed to me\nthat Ruscha had achieved exactly what\nhis art seeks out to do, in this instance,\nusing the audience as a living artwork,\nwho orally expressed the droll.\nA example of Ruscha\u2019s \u2018Standard Station\u2019 series. At the exhibit you can see this painting set on fire...\nEd Ruscha: Fifty Years of Painting will\nbe showing at the Hayward Gallery\nat the Southbank until Sunday 10\nJanuary.\nTickets are \u00a36.00 concessions for\nstudents. Nearest tube station is\nWaterloo\n\n"

Granted, if we go\nbelow the surface of 'Legen-dary' it looks a bit like this:\nOn Saturday we flooded into the\nminibus and began our journey to\nOgof Ffynnon Ddu (Or for those not\nfluent in Welsh \u2013 OFD!) Upon arriving I didn't know what to expect, being a total beginner in this recreational\nsport, so I followed the flow and began\nchanging. After 5 minutes of putting\non borrowed kit I felt like a caver!\nOn entering the cave it was utter\ndarkness. Not the night-time sky darkness you've seen, but absolute absence\nof light.\nWith our helmet lights on, my eyes\nbegan to adjust and I saw the most\nspectacular view. Now I know what\nyou're thinking \u2013 \u2018he's strange\u2019. When\nB\ny 11:30 the road train of\nminibus and trailer had arrived in Portsmouth, ably\npiloted by Dan Lehmann.\nHaving only recently acquired parts, Robert Carter and Dave\nHankin quickly set to sealing Bo\u2019s water jacket ahead of the first few miles\nacross Portsmouth to the Wight Link\nFerry. Having arrived at the ferry ter-minal, and positioned in the queue, I\nwas asked by a terminal official \u201cwhat\u2019s\nthe dripping from the bottom?\u201d. Assuming he meant the oil slick we were\nseeping as a consequence of our total\nloss oiling system, I reliably informed\nhim that it was \u201cjust a little water\nfrom our cooling system\u201d. The official\nseemed satisfied.\nBy the end of the first day numerous Team Bo\u2019 alumni had arrived. For\nour first full day, Team Bo\u2019 + Alumni\nin various vehicles decided to venture\nsouth to Ventnor via the visually stunning coast road. With a reliable side\nwind and the odd sunny spell, Bo\u2019 was\nable to power up every hill thrown at\nhim and attended the Botanical Gardens in good time.\nOn Thursday we were to drive from\nFreshwater Bay to Havenstreet via\nCowes and the north coast of the is-land. Confidently we cranked up in 3\nturns of the handle and set our sights\non Cowes. Having descended a 1:5\nhill steadily in 2nd gear we heard a\nsound we all dreaded to hear, a well\npronounced squeak from the mid left\nin time with engine speed. The 3 of\nus looked at each other, pulled over\nand killed the ignition. The initial assumption was a Big End bearing was\nunhappy.\nFor those less technically minded,\nthe Big End bearing is the contact\npoint between the reciprocating piston\nand the crank web. All the power developed by the engine must go through\nthese bearings. In a modern car, the\nbig ends slap around in the oil sump\nso have no choice but to be well lubri-cated. Bo\u2019 however does not have an oil\nsump and relies upon oil being dripped\ndown a tube and sucked via the crank\nweb to the inside of the bearing. It was\nthis process of dripping and sucking \u2013\nor lack thereof \u2013 that we immediately\nsuspected as causing the squeak.\nWe made our way to the chain ferry/\nfloating bridge and paid the princely\nsum of \u00a31.50 to cross. I tried to argue\nthat we were a bicycle \u2013 hence the\nchains \u2013 but the \u00a31.50 was still taken\nfrom us. As a result of our delay we\nwere unable to visit Osbourne house.\nInstead we did a lap of the car park just\nto check it was really closed and continued on our way to the bemusement\nof onlookers.\nWe arrived in Havenstreet to discover that the paper work describing\nour camping pitch had been left in the\nminibus which was also somewhere\nat Havenstreet, so we decided to park\nup in empty plot number 60. Having\nretrieved our paper work later that\nevening we returned to crank up to\nmove across to plot number 69. Dave\nremarked that he was having issues\ntickling the Carburettor to which I just\nsaid \u201cNah, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine, let\u2019s\nstart up\u201d. Dave diligently did the 3rd\ncrank but no luck and by the time it\ncame to the 5th we decided it might be\ngood to check the fuel. We had indeed\nrun out of fuel, but safe in the knowledge that we had 5 litres in the back,\nwe rolled down the hill to plot 69 for\nthe night.\nOnce we had pitched our tent and\nsecured the Gazebo over Bo\u2019 we made\nour way across to the \u2018show field\u2019 to acquaint ourselves with the Beer tent.\nFor the Friday to Monday, Bo\u2019 was\nan exhibit at the Island Steam Show\nat Haven Street which had the air of a\n1950\u2019s village Fete. During this time we\ntook the opportunity to clean, polish\nand wax Bo\u2019 between the rain showers\n\u2013 having relocated the Gazebo to keep\nhim dry. We also took the opportunity\nto dismantle the oil delivery system and\ngive it an overhaul which proved to be\na great success. The regular features of\nthe day included a car and motor bike\nparade of which Bo\u2019 and Derrick both\nparticipated in daily. Intrigue and fascination were lavished upon Derrick\ndue to his unusual design as well as\nhub centric steering \u2013 a feature that is\nseen as a modern asset by today\u2019s bik-ers. Bo\u2019 was regularly remarked as being the 2nd oldest Vehicle at the steam\nshow \u2013 2nd to a traction engine.\nWe did participate in the Gymkhana\n(slalom time trial), for which we scored\na time of 51 seconds. Compared to Jez\u2019s\n46 I didn\u2019t think we had done too badly.\nMonday was to be the last day of\nthe Steam show, so after the final\nevent Bo\u2019 made a hasty exit from the\narena to head back to Freshwater bay\n(a more direct route this time), because on Tuesday the challenge was\nset. We would drive from Lymington\nin the New Forest to Imperial over 2\ndays, covering over 100 miles, and in\neffect achieveing 2 Brighton runs in\nsuccession.\nOn tuesday morning Bo\u2019 was loaded\nonto the trailer in Freshwater Bay, and\nremained on the trailer for the ferry\ncrossing in order to satisfy the ferry\nticketing system. Bo\u2019 was promptly unloaded just outside the ferry terminal,\nfluids checked and wet weather gear\nadorned. It just started to rain as we\npulled away from the curb and our first\ndestination was Beaulieu Motor Museum. Although we had not made prior\narrangements to attend Beaulieu, we\nwere in need of a road map which we\npurchased from the gift shop. Coming in at 50% list price I thought I had\nfound a bargain \u2013 we later realised the\ngrid squares were not quite square, but\nthe price was satisfying enough. The\nplan was to drive to North Hampshire\nwhere lodgings had been arranged for\nBo\u2019 and the team.\nThe next morning we were ready and\nmotoring by 9am. By 11 we were in\nGuildford where we stopped for lunch,\ncontinuing later only to be greeted by\na rain storm on the way to Woking.\nOur route continued on to Byfleet\nand eventually to Hampton court and\nRichmond. We crossed the river at\nHammersmith and were able to make\nour victory drive down High Street\nKensington, before arriving back at the\ngarage by 4:30 ready for tea (or numerous pints at the Union).\nBo\u2019 had driven over 200 miles during\nthe course of 8 days with no significant\ndelays or set backs \u2013 proving truly that\nBoanerges was reliable, eager and definitely up for the challenge of another\n75 years of student ownership.\nOn the way to Freshwater Bay\nare rocks beautiful? Pictures can't even\nbegin to capture the wonder. Moving\non through the cave I began to realise\njust how vast OFD was!\nIt did bring out the child in me,\nthough. As Jana says: \u201cA cave is an\nadult's playground\u201d. Crawling on the\nrocks, climbing up bits of colossal\nrock, sliding down muddy passages \u2013\nah, the good old days. Clambering into\nan enormous chamber makes you realise how small you actually are. But the\nsights are worth it!\nCrystal-like structures forming\nround puddles, waterfalls, preserved\nspecimens. On returning to the hut\n(Well they say a hut... I don't know\nmany huts with showers and micro-waves!), I took part in the cavers' substitute to drinking games. I won't spoil\nall the fun, you'll have to come along\nto find out..\nOn Sunday we split up into smaller\ngroups and I jumped at the chance to\ngo river-caving in Little Neath.\nWe went through an entrance down\na river into an underground maze. It's\namazing to see the sheer power of water after years of wearing away what\nwas once a solid piece of rock. Then we\ngot to swim in the cave when it opened\nout (they lend people wetsuits). It was\nso peaceful, you just heard the running\nof water echoing off of the walls. We\ntraversed every area of the river cave in\njust under 3 hours and came back out\nafter much more climbing, crawling\nand sliding. This cave was even more\nspectacular with lots of small feats \u2013\nNature's miracles.\nOn the minibus home I was glad of\nsome rest after an intense weekend,\nbut as we drove out of Wales there was\na part of me that longed to go back.\nJezebel, Derrick, Clem and Bo\u2019 at Havenstreet\nThe Cavers descend far below Wales\nWho needs the sun when you all have matching yellow suits?\nEmail: bonerges@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "4 felix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNEWS FEATURE\nFUs PARTYING INTO THE THE RED...\nIS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR FACULTY UNIONS TO BE LOSING THOUSANDS OF POUNDS FOR THE SAKE OF FUN?\nAFONSO CAMPOS INVESTIGATES IN LIGHT OF THE RCSU AND CGCU FORMAL EVENTS LAST WEEK...\nI\nn the last few weeks, the two main\nFaculty Unions have held their Freshers\u2019 Balls. The Royal College of Science\nUnion held its event at the well-known\nand prestigious Cocoon \u2013 a central\nLondon restaurant, bar and club famous for its\nstatus as a bit of a celebrity haunt \u2013 and Dan Le\nSac provided entertainment. The CGCU opted\nfor a Masquerade themed ball held throughout\nthe Union Building with top indie/dance band\nNew Young Pony Club headlining the evening\u2019s\nactivities which included a hypnotist in the form\nof previous felix Editor Martin Taylor as well as\nstudent bands. Most attending either event had a\ngood time, despite neither being at full capacity.\nfelix has heard from numerous attendants that\ndinner was great at both, but particularly \u201cimpressive\u201d at the RCSU Autumn Ball, according to\na third year mathematician. Emilie Stammers, a\nfirst year biologist, thought that \u201cthe hypnotist [at\nCGCU\u2019s Ball] was really good\u201d as it \u201clivened up\nthe wait for the dinner\u201d\n.\nSince this is the first large-scale event of the\nyear for both Unions, the respective Presidents\nthemselves played the biggest part in the logistics and organisation. Despite this, financial-ly, neither was a success in any way given that\nboth lost a significant quantity of money. felix\nobtained from a CGCU committee member a\nstatement that the loss stands at \u201caround \u00a35000\u201d\nfor the their Ball, but after research and confirmation from the DPFS, Danny Hill, this seems to\nbe much closer to \u00a37,500. RCSU have reported\na loss of \u00a33500 which felix has not been able to\nconfirm with the DPFS at this stage. It is perfectly\nacceptable for these kind of events to lose some\nmoney as they are fulfilling one of the ethos of the\nFaculty Unions, which is to provide good quality entertainment to its members. The Balls help\nraise a campus-wide awareness of the Unions and\nengage the students. Stephen Long, CGCU VicePresident of Ac- tivities, believes they foster\na \u201csense of belonging\u201d\n.\nfelix wonders, however, if the losses\ncurrently being reported are actually acceptable in terms of opportunity\ncost. Losing vast quantities of money is\nnot a new thing as both the RCSU and\nCGCU have officially stated that they intend to use Faculty grants to cover some\nof their financial shortcomings resulting\nfrom the Ball in order to keep both\nUnions in a healthy financial situ-ation. Faculty grants were instated\nin order to cover costs affecting\nthe entire body of constituents\nand an anonymous student has argued that spending it on \u201c200 students rather than 4000 seems like\na bit of a joke\u201d\n.\nKatya-yani Vyas, the RCSU President has stated\nthat her biggest worry before the ball was that the\nevent \u201cwouldn\u2019t sell enough tickets\u201d; a sentiment\nechoed by Stephen Long. When confronted with\nthe losses, Miss Vyas said that the Ball was \u201cnot a\nprofit making activity\u201d\n. In a statement to felix, Mr\nLong said that \u201cadmittedly, not a huge amount\u201d\nwas done to publicise the event, resulting in a less\nthan ideal turnout, while the the RCSU president\nbelieves her expectations were \u201ctoo high\u201d for the\nnumber of attendants, but that these predictions\nwere based on previous years selling out.\n\u201cSpending the faculty grant on 200\nstudents rather than 4000 seems\nlike a bit of a joke.\u201d\nDespite selling out, it is worth noting that some\nevents are predicted to make a significant loss as\nwell, with RCSU\u2019s Summer Ball at Taman Gang\nhaving ended up in the red around \u00a35500.\nShould a loss in these events be softer than the\nones currently being experienced, the capital\navailable could most likely be put to better use\nelsewhere. Suggestions for potential uses of the\nmoney include:\n\u2022 Welfare purposes\n\u2022 Increased number of smaller events\nthroughout the year with a capacity to perpetuate the Union\u2019s brand\n\u2022 Sponsorship of merchandise to the same\neffect and,\n\u2022 The sponsorship of educational and career\ntalks and events.\nWhile the RCSU seems to have run the event\nsmoothly, to the book and without major\nhiccups, the same cannot be said of the CGCU,\nwhich appears to be having some internal\nproblems.\nCSU AND CGCU FORMAL E\nRCSU President\nKatya-yani\nVyas: \u201cThere\nwas nothing\npointing to the\nAutumn Ball to\nbe unsuccessful.\nOur only mistake\nwas our high\nexpectations\u201d\nCGCU President\nKirsty Patterson\nchose not to\nspeak to felix,\nand is under\nheavy inspection\nafter the\nCGCU\nMasquerade\nBall\u2019s failings\n\n"

The year begins...\nL\nondon Chocolate Week. I\nsay there is no better way\nthan this to start a new\nschool year. It either helps\nyou fight your post-summer\nblues, or boosts your start-of-term\nexcitement.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know,\nChocolate Week is an annual event\nin England, especially London, where\ntonnes of chocolate-related events\nhappen throughout the week. (I mean\nit\u2019s horrendous not to know about\nsuch an amazing thing!!!). The aim of\nit is to promote the culture of quality\nchocolate.\nAs a chocolate enthusiast, the first\nthing on my itinerary for the week\nwould of course be going to the launching convention \u2013 Chocolate. Therefore\non that lovely Saturday morning while\nmost of you were probably still in bed,\nI merrily strolled to the May Fair Hotel (oh yes, posh I know), where all the\nwonderful chocolatey things happened.\nGoodness me, there was sooo much\nfantastic chocolate to taste! Obviously\nthere is no such thing as being too\nearly for chocolate. All the visitors/\njournalists just kept popping pieces of\nchocolate into their mouths. It really\nis a non-stop process. There are some\nchocolates so marvellous that I feel I\nmust share them with you.\nFresh mint truffles \u2013 goodness gra-cious! This has to be the BEST mint\ntruffle that I have ever had. You know\nfrom the bright, cool, leafy taste that\nthey created it using fresh mint instead\nof the conventional peppermint oil -absolutely gorgeous.\nGoat\u2019s cream chocolate. So, what\nwere you doing back when you were\n17? Just getting into uni, not really\nknowing what you are going to do in\nlife?\nThe designer of this chocolate was\nonly 17 when he got an award for this\ncreation. And the inspiration behind\nthe design? His best mate has a dairy\nallergy\u2026\nPopping candy chocolate \u2013 this made\nme feel like I was having a Harry Potter style wizardry treat. As the chocolate smoothly melts in your mouth, the\npopping candy just keeps exploding\nthe whole time. You simply cannot talk\nfor five minutes after eating the chocolate because your mouth is filled with\nthis crackling all over. What\u2019s more,\nthey have made the chocolate into the\nshape of a frog, making it even more\nmagical. Definitely the most fun chocolate ever had!\nNext came ginger chocolate. Okay,\nnow you think this is the usual boring\ndark chocolate with disgusting chunky\ncrystallised ginger, which just ruin the\nsmooth texture entirely. But NOOO,\nwhen you look at the cross-section of\nthis chocolate, you can observe the fine\nginger crystal powder mixing evenly\nwith the dark chocolate ganache.\nMmm\u2026. lovely.\nA few other interesting tasters include\na 100% handmade bar, raw chocolate\ntruffles, Long Jing tea truffles, passion\nfruit truffles with real passion fruit\nseeds\u2026 I must force myself to stop here,\nor else I could go on forever and ever\nand take up the entire felix.\nSo looking at my most fabulous\nschedule ahead, I simply can\u2019t wait to\ngo to my chocolate tasting at L\u2019artisan\ndu Chocolat and to see Marc Demarquette at Fortnum & Mason! Not to\nmention the free chocolate at shops\nhere and there.\nUnfortunately, by the time you read\nthis, the week will be nearly over, but\nI advise you not to miss out on the\nlast chances on Saturday and Sunday!\nI know that Rococo Chocolate is giving out free hot chocolate shots in all\ntheir shops. And if all these are simply not enough for you, check out the\nChocolate Society at Imperial; apparently they do have quite a lot of nice\nstuff to offer.\nGreenpeace weren\u2019t happy with the Biology Department\u2019s GM exploding frogs.\nThese are far more tasty.\nAPPLY NOW!

    "content": "13\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk POLITICS\nSri Lanka\u2019s Tamils: a People Forgotten?\nIn mid-May this year the Sri-Lankan\ngovernment announced the defeat of\nthe Tamil Tigers (LTTE). Days after\nthe government\u2019s announcement, the\nLTTE released a statement confirming the war had come to its \u201cbitter end\u201d,\nheralding the d\u00e9nouement of one the\nworld\u2019s longest and bloodiest conflicts.\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa, already\nconsiderably popular before the end of\nthe war, gained the status of a national\nhero. And there was good reason. The\nLTTE, who had sought secession and\na complete monopoly of the politics of\nthe country\u2019s Tamil minority, were pioneers in the practice of suicide bombing and child conscription and were as\nbrutal towards Tamils as towards the\nSinhalese majority.\nBut military victory was only ever\ngoing to be the beginning. The conflict\nhad left over 300,000 of the small island\u2019s population displaced and thousands more injured. The government\nwas far from guiltless, having engaged\nin abuses such as alleged state-sanc-tioned murders, illegal abductions, and\nintimidation of journalists, lawyers\nand aid workers.\nIt was clear that a war-free Sri Lanka\nwas by no means equivalent to a free\none. Mr Rajapaksa\u2019s government, although accused, stood at the cusp of a\nrare opportunity to break with the past\nand begin a process of healing and national reconciliation between the Sinhalese majority and the long-abused\nTamil minority.\nUnfortunately this task does not\nseem to be near the top of the priority\nlist of a government that seems much\nmore passionate about weeding out remaining Tigers than solving the country\u2019s real problems.\nSince the end of the conflict, authorities have made what can only be described as half-hearted and superficial\nattempts at rebuilding. Months after\nthe war\u2019s end, roughly 260,000 Tamils\nremain essentially prisoners in gov-ernment-run internment camps in the\nnorth of the island. Health and sanitation standards fall spectacularly short\nof international standards, with food,\nclean water and medical resources\nsorely lacking. And yet the Sri Lankan\ngovernment still restricts the activities of aid organizations trying to access the area, limiting their both their\nnumbers and the types of activity they\nare allowed to engage in. The impending monsoon season threatens to make\nwhat are already inhumane living conditions much, much worse. Flooding\nin the camps in August destroyed shel-ters, burst sewage systems, and resulted in at least 5 deaths according to the\nInternational Crisis Group, a Brusselsbased international watchdog. The\ngovernment claims that the villagers\nmust be kept in these enclosed camps\nuntil their homes and farms have been\ncompletely de-mined, yet tens of thousands could feasibly be released to live\nwith relatives, host-families or simply\nin other areas.\nTempers have reportedly begun to\nrise within the camps. On September\n27th, the military reportedly opened\nfire on refugees it claimed were trying\nto escape the camps.\nThe government itself, still riding a\nwave of popularity at home, seems bewildered at the rest of the world\u2019s reactions to its slow pace. With external\npressure for authorities to publish the\nnames of detainees, engage in a transparent screening process for suspected\nTigers, allow full access into camps for\naid agencies and allow refugees the\nright to leave camps on their own ac-cord, the government has seemed de-fensive. Defence Secretary Gotabhaya\nRajapaksa has described pressure from\nwestern governments as \u201cjealous\u201d because they \u201chave not defeated terrorism as we have\u201d.\nSri Lanka\u2019s international image is sure\nAnthony Maina\nAnthony Maina\nPresident Mahinda Rajapaksa proves to be adept at using three microphones at one time whilst delivering a speech\nto suffer from such inaction. An active\nTamil diaspora will continue to make\ncalls for investigations into war crimes\nby both sides. The EU has yet to decide\nwhether to withdraw Sri Lanka\u2019s special trade privileges on human-rights\ngrounds, a decision which would hit\nthe country\u2019s garment producers hard\nand provoke a rise in unemployment.\nBut perhaps the more serious consequences of such insensitivity will be\nfound at home. An unwillingness to\nallow the Tamil minority equal opportunity is what sparked conflict\nin the first place. Today, a hollow\nliberation and the dire lack of reassurance that steps towards a freer,\nmore inclusive state are even being\nconsidered threaten to jeopardize\nany future hopes for real peace. For\nSri Lanka\u2019s Tamils, the painful wait\ncontinues.\nCastro \u201cBetrayed...the [Cuban] revolution\u201d says Castro\nThe sister of Cuba\u2019s former leader and\nrevolutionary figurehead Fidel Castro,\nand current president Raul has admitted to spying for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the 1960s.\nSensitive information was gathered\nby Juanita Castro for the US over a period of 3 years. Ms Castro, who now\nlives in Miami, wrote in her memoirs\nthat she had fallen out with Fidel and\nRaul over the killing of their political\nopponents.\nThe 76 year old said she helped to\nwarn and hide Cuban dissidents before\nfinally deciding to flee Cuba in 1964.\nDespite these extraordinary remarks from the memoirs entitled \u201cFidel and Raul, My Brothers, the Secret\nHistory\u201d, there has been no reaction\nfrom either the US or Cuban governments as yet.\nIt was in Havana where Ms Castro\nclaims to have been recruited by the\nCIA in 1961, two years after the revolution that catapulted Fidel Castro into\npower.\nThe former leader of the largest of\nthe Caribbean islands has not been\nseen in public since falling ill in July\n2006. Fidel relinquished power in February 2008 and Raul Castro was voted\nin as President.\nJuanita Castro agreed to help the US\nbecause she had become disenchanted\nwith the revolution when Fidel abandoned his promise of a nationalist\ndemocratic revolution and imposed a\none-party Marxist state \u201csimply out of\nthe need to hold power\u201d she claims.\n\u201cDid I feel remorse about betraying Fidel by agreeing to meet with his\nenemies? No, for one simple reason:\nI didn\u2019t betray him. He betrayed me,\u201d\nMs. Castro wrote. The betrayal of his\nprinciples for democratic revolutionary change forced Fidel\u2019s sister to turn\nagainst him.\n\u201cHe betrayed the thousands of us\nwho suffered and fought for the revolution that he had offered, one that\nwas generous and just and would bring\npeace and democracy to Cuba, and\nwhich, as he himself had promised,\nwould be as \u2018Cuban as palm trees\u2019 \u201d she\nadded.\nAt a meeting with a CIA officer\ncalled \u201cEnrique\u201d at a hotel in Mexico\nCity in 1961, Ms Castro was given the\ncodename \u201cDonna\u201d and codebooks\nso she could receive instructions. Her\ntask was to help those people persecuted by the Cuban secret police escape\ntorture, imprisonment and execution.\nThis often involved sheltering them\nat the home of her mother, Lina Ruz\nGonzalez.\nJuanita Castro agreed on the condition that she received no money and\nwas not asked to participate in any violence against the Cuban government.\nAfter her mother died, she feared for\nher own protection from the secret police so a year later fled to Miami.

A felix music\nwebsite is coming! Not excited,\nhuh? Well try this out for size:\nthere\u2019ll be longer, more in-depth\nreviews, and weekly playlists of the\nmusic we\u2019ve been reviewing, so that\nit\u2019ll be easier for you guys to listen to\nthe music we\u2019ve been talking about.\nExcited now? Jeez, fine, just wait till\nyou see it. Then you\u2019ll be sorry!\nWe\u2019ve also re-introduced gig listings,\nwhich you can see down there in the bottom right-hand corner of the opposite\npage. It seemed a little silly to only have\ngig reviews, essentially just blowing our\ntongues at you guys saying \u201cSee what you\nmissed out on!\u201d Now you\u2019ll have a heads-up on just a little bit of London\u2019s musical\nofferings for the coming week.\nA little final bit of housekeeping -this year we\u2019ve tried to have a number\nof different articles and reviews for you\nguys to read each week. Obviously the\namount of space we have is limited and\nas a result, the articles and reviews are\ngoing to be to the point; there\u2019s just\nno space to be long-winded. We think\nit\u2019s a better approach, but if you think\nit\u2019s the greatest catastrophe since the\nHindenburg went up in flames, then\nsend us an email on music.felix@gmail.\ncom and let us know.\nRight, finally on to some music.\nJamie T\u2019s new album Kings & Queens\nis simply fantastic. Admittedly there\u2019s\none god-awful song on it (Castro Dies)\nbut other than that it\u2019s frenetic, witty,\nexciting, and grabs you even harder\neach time you decipher another of his\nlyrics. He grabs samples from a range\nof genres and piles them all together\nto produce tunes like \u2018The Man\u2019s Machine\u2019 and \u2018368\u2019. I\u2019m fully aware that I\nmay be the only person who likes Jamie\nT, but I\u2019ve made a decision in this re-gard; everyone\u2019s wrong except me.\nI kid you not, there exists in the\nworld an album called Gangstagrass,\nfrom an artist called Rench. In essence it\u2019s gangsta rap combined beautifully with good ole\u2019 bluegrass. 22\ntracks of banjo intertwined with tales\nof the hood, and when you hear a fiddle overlaid with thug rap, you\u2019ll never\nthink of either genre in the same way.\nIt\u2019s not jarring either; as soon as you\nhear the banjo and drums opening the\nfirst track \u201cGoing Down\u201d, it\u2019s immediately obvious and perfectly natural\nthat someone should lay a little rap\non.\nThe last bit of music that I feel the\nneed to tell you about is quite possibly\nthe happiest, most uplifting song ever\nwritten by any human, ever. The song\nis called Home, by a new LA band,\nEdward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. It\u2019s a little country number, with\na couple singing to each other, southern drawl included. It begins with the\nheart-warming line, \u201cAlabama, Arkansas, I do love my ma and pa, not\nthe way that I do love you\u201d. I dare you\nnot to feel better after listening to this\nsong. Seriously, it\u2019s impossible.\nKadhim Shubber\nKadhim Shubber Music Editor\nReviews\nThis melancholy brooding mixture of\npost-rock, raw punk and grunge will\nfail to ignite passion in you, as it lacks\nfocus and structure. The Karen-O style\nsinging is best displayed on the concise\n\u2018Body Rot\u2019 and \u2018Bad Dream/Hartford\u2019s\nBeat Suite\u2019, rare examples of the vocals\nbeing sung in time or tune. The meandering guitar often seems to be travelling in a completely different direction\nto the rest of the band. - Tom Jennings\nThis LP varies from mildly interesting\nto thumpingly superb. It begins with a\nrather generic drum & bass tune about\n\u2018Strange Things\u2019 that happen on Friday\nnights. However, the rest of the CD is\nsimply pure gold. Horns, electro glibs\nand deep bass all compete for attention\nin a way that is immensely satisfying.\n-Kadhim Shubber\nTHE COUNT\nAND SINDEN\nMEGA\nDOMINO\nRECORDS\nLP\nMorrissey\nRoyal Albert Hall\n27th October\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nA\nfter a collapse onstage in\nSwindon three nights previ-ous, Morrissey walked out\nonto the stage at the Royal\nAlbert Hall to an anxious crowd, hoping a similar occurrence would not\nruin this evening. Tonight\u2019s gig is actually rescheduled from May, and starting the set with a Smiths classic \u2018This\nCharming Man\u2019 he tells us \u2018Fasten your\nseatbelts it\u2019s going to be a bumpy night\u2019.\nWith a tour schedule already riddled\nwith cancellations due to illness, it\u2019s\ngood to see him patch himself together\nso quickly after being discharged from\nhospital. He seems comfortable on\nstage, with a commanding stage pres-ence, and even in good spirits, joking\n\u201cThe doctor said I shouldn\u2019t smile. I\ntold him, \u2018I don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d Vocally it might not\nhave been his greatest ever perform-ance, sometimes sounding strained,\nbut given the circumstances it was certainly very commendable.\nA curious decision was to fake another collapse, then get back to his\nfeet, saying \u2018Thank you, Swindon\u2019. That\ncertainly seemed in bad taste, and no\none really found it particularly funny.\nThe standard rant about vegetarianism\nalso came out; he wasn\u2019t happy because\nthere were people in the crowd who\nstill eat meat. That aside, and all things\nconsidered, a very solid performance\nfrom one of the pillars of modern British music.\nMorrissey\u2019s still alive, whoo hoo!\nChristopher Walmsley charmed by \u201cThis Charming Man\u201d\nBristol has always been a mystifyingly\ngood place for electronic music, producing the likes of Massive Attack,\nPortishead and Tricky. Fuck Buttons\nare continuing this tradition, debuting last year with the hype-grabbing\nalbum \u2018Street Horrrsing.\u2019 \u2018Tarot Sport\u2019\ntakes them into a different direction,\ndue to the influence of producer Andrew Weatherall, renowned for bridging the gap between rock and dance.\nTheir noise-rock influences have been\nmade subtler, allowing their hooky\ndance sensibilities to shine through.\nThe songs may all still be around the\n10-minute mark, but they drill into\nyour consciousness. Combining this\nwith their already-present darkly layered sound, the album is a worthy addition to Bristol\u2019s legacy. - Hugh Crail\nFUCK BUTTONS\nTAROT SPORT\nATP\nALBUM\nThe TV show is over, but you can relive the magic of New Zealand\u2019s fourth\nmost popular rap-funk-comedy duo\nwith their second studio album. It\u2019s\nbasically just the songs from the second season in all their freaky splen-dour. The fergie-licious \u2018Sugalumps\u2019 is\na hilarious ode to testicles everywhere,\nwhile the call-and-response rap of\n\u2018We\u2019re Both In Love With A Sexy Lady\u2019\nparodies Usher & Kelly\u2019s over-the-top\nbromosexual anthem. As a comedy al-bum, it\u2019s pure gold. And hopefully you\nmight even see a sly DJ or two breaking\nout \u2018Too Many Dicks\u2019 on a dancefloor\nnear you.\nFLIGHT OF THE\nCONCHORDS\nI TOLD YOU I\nWAS FREAKY\nALBUM\nThis slow-plodding acoustic pop,\nevoking dreamy clouds and rolling\nlandscapes, certainly has a similarity to indie birdband Doves. Gentle,\nwarm, and if they were in your house\nyou wouldn\u2019t feel weird inviting them\ninto your bath, or into your bedroom\nto sing you a lullaby. - Tom Jennings\nTHE RIFLE\nVOLUNTEER\nEND SEASON\nTOO PURE\nSINGLE M&S are a masterpiece of a band, this\nsingle as evidence. The use of human\nvoice for heartfelt harmonies and\nhuge emotion could cause a tear. This\nis a beautifully composed song, with\namazing dynamics and careful layering\ngiving a sense of modesty. Listening\nto this leaves me feeling at ease with\nthe future and direction of folk music.\n-Luke Turner\nMUMFORD AND\nSONS\nWINTER WINDS\nUNIVERSAL\nISLANDRECORDS\nSINGLE\nMAGIK\nMARKERS\nBALF QUARRY\nDRAG CITY\nALBUM\nDave Grohl, Josh Homme and John\nPaul Jones release their self-titled debut as TCV in the UK on November\n16th. \u2018New Fang\u2019 is the first full-length\nstudio track they\u2019ve made available\nonline, and it\u2019s a sexy, driving, high-quality, rock epic. TCV are making impressive music that meets and exceeds\nexpectations.- Michael Inkpen\nTHEM\nCROOKED\nVULTURESI\nNEW FANG\nSONG BMG\nSINGLE\nThe debut album \u2018Taxi Taxi\u2019 is simply beautiful. Whilst unlikely to be\nhailed a groundbreaking work of lyrical originality, the vocals are ultimately\ncompelling and endearing. They have a\nchild-like feel that can be jaunty - such\nas in \u2018Old Big Trees\u2019 - or haunting and\nstartling - in opening track \u2018Still standing at your back door\u2019. I imagine that if\nyou enjoy Bon Iver, you\u2019ll likely enjoy\nthis too, and I\u2019m pretty sure that everyone likes Bon Iver. - Kadhim Shubber\nTAXI TAXI\nSTILL STANDING\nAT YOUR BACK\nDOOR\nFIERCE PANDA\nALBUM\nThis album is unbearably exciting. It\ntaps a bit of Four Tet and Little Heath,\nand some heavily distorted bass, to\nproduce an album that sounds and\nfeels fantastic. - Kadhim Shubber\nGENTLE\nFRIENDLY\nRIDE SLOW\nALBUM\ntell us what you\nthink, music.felix@\ngmail.com\n\n"

After careful thought (as\nin I saw the line-up), I finally decided it\nwas a brilliant way of relieving all that\npre-exam stress (I honestly believed\nthat...).\nNow, months later, that weekend\nseems a world away. It\u2019s more like a\nfuzzy haze of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll memories.\nBut there are moments from those\nthree days I swear I could never forget\neven if I tried.\nHeld annually at Donington Park,\nDownload is the place to be every June\nif you\u2019re even remotely interested in\nall things loud and aggressive. Thankfully Ravi and I aren\u2019t the only ones\nwho get off to the sound of distorted\nguitars and so we were joined by (ap-proximately) 79,998 other metal fans\ngathered in that field with only one\nobjective: headbanging for three days\nstraight.\nImagine my surprise then, as Ravi\nand I crossed a camp site the size of\neight football fields only to be greeted\nby hordes of drunken youths falling\nover each other and ingesting all things\nillicit. And just like a certain Andrew\nWK, these kids like to party... hard.\nNeedless to say, madness is infectious.\nWe finally reach the furthest edge of\nthe furthest camp site where we settle\n\u2013 for lack of space anywhere else \u2013 and\nstart to put our tent up. At this point\nany semblance of normality disap-pears: a bunch of guys sitting in a circle\na few feet away from us, heads tilted\nback, are monging the fuck out. One of\nthem is wearing a full-on leather gimp\nmask, regardless of the boiling weather.\nThe others affectionately refer to him\nas \u201cGimpy\u201d, as in \u201cCome on, Gimpy,\nyou\u2019re already fucked on Ket, might\nas well take shrooms too!\u201d With logic\nas flawless as this, it\u2019s no wonder they\nnever actually made it to the concerts.\nAs responsible and functional jour-nalists, Ravi and I decided this was\na good time to leave the freaks to\ntheir dirty deeds and hit the festival\ngrounds. After walking for God knows\nhow long, the music gets progressively\nlouder and I slowly realize that the degeneration displayed in the camp site\nis but an appetizer for what awaits us.\nRight at the gates, a group of 15-year\nolds are gathered around a stretcher,\ntrying to wake their bloodied friend\nup. His forehead is split open and the\nRed Cross already seem overwhelmed\nwith headcases like this (all puns in-tended). Little did we know at the time,\nwe would see at least one bloody teenager being carried away on a stretcher\nper day.\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen so many\npeople gathered in a single place:\nin every direction, everywhere you\nlooked, stretching far beyond the ho-rizon, leather-clad metal fans stood in\nfront of three massive stages. Crossing\nthe ocean of flailing human bodies by\nstumbling over each other is a difficult\ntask, and it can take as long as half an\nhour just to get to the front of the goddamn stage. And that\u2019s if you make it\nunscathed, which isn\u2019t as simple as it\nsounds. With loud music comes absurdly violent \u201cdance\u201d forms, that\u2019s\njust math. Since your average heavy\nmetal fan is large, hairy and probably\non some kind of drug, it\u2019s no surprise\nmost people get knocked the fuck out\nwhen participating in the bucket of fun\nwe call a moshpit.\nThis wasn\u2019t a music festival, it was a\ngoddamn battle field.\nAfter 618 words, I realize I haven\u2019t\nreviewed a single band yet. So ignoring\nthe piss-awful emo-krunk posers Hollywood Undead and their love of terrible songs, crappy masks, and blowing\nhorses, we made our way to see the hot\nchick from Lacuna Coil. On our way\nwe meet an alarmingly vast number of\npeople who pose the same ridiculous\nquestion: \u201cYou going to watch M\u00f6tley\nCr\u00fce, dude??\u201d I choose not to answer.\nLacuna Coil are entertaining enough\n(thank you hot chick) for me to watch\nthe entire set. And it\u2019s a damn good\nthing I did: Opeth were up next. Having heard only good things about them\nbut never properly giving them the\ntime of day, I was amazed to discover\nthat they are one of the best metal\nbands in the world. You learn something every day, I guess. Any band who\nplay 14 minute songs without boring\nyou to death deserve respect in my\nbook. Frontman Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt is\nnot only a gifted singer (screamer, if\nyou will) and guitarist, he is also witty\nand downright hilarious. At the end of\ntheir first song he announces with a\ncompletely straight face: \u201cThank you.\nWe are M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. No I\u2019m kidding,\nwe\u2019re the much worse opening band\nfor M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce: Whitesnake\u201d. Genius.\nThat day, Opeth won themselves a new\nfan.\nFor every person saying how great\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce were going to be, there\nwere ten others describing how much\nthey \u201cfucking hated\u201d recently-re-formed nu-metal veterans Limp Bizkit.\nThese are the same thousands of people I then saw going mental a few hours\nlater to Fred Durst\u2019s childishly hateful\nrap and Wes Borland\u2019s crazy nu-rave\nAmazonian Warrior costume. And you\nknow what? Good for Limp Bizkit. Not\njust because I used to dig Chocolate\nStarfish when I was 12 and angsty, but\nbecause they\u2019re a polished and powerful live band who don\u2019t give a shit\nwhat people think about them. Also,\nthe Mission Impossible theme tune\nsounds badass on a distorted guitar.\nThey conquer even the most hateful\n\u201chardcore\u201d audiences, and that\u2019s quite\nsomething when you actually listen to\nthe music they make.\nNext up on the Nu-Metal reunion\ntour (a bit of a theme this year), KoRn\nhit the stage. Though I was a massive\nKoRn fan back in their heyday, I was\nnot expecting much from a band missing half its original members. So I was\nas shocked as a donkey with diarrhoea\nwhen they rocked through classics\n\u201cFreak On A Leash\u201d, \u201cGot The Life\u201d and\neven their \u201cAnother Brick In The Wall\u201d\ncover with enthusiasm, passion and\ngenuine skill. In other words, they still\ngot it! Jonathan Davis\u2019 voice is as spine-chilling as ever, and the band still have\nthat dirty-yet-perfectly-audible sound\nthey\u2019ve been honing for 16 years now.\nFriday night ended on another triumphant return, that of (my personal\nJesus) Mike Patton\u2019s much loved and\ninfluential alternative rock outfit, Faith\nNo More. Not only did they tear shit up\nin style, sporting immaculately white\nsuits, they also played a hilarious cover\nof Lady Gaga\u2019s hermaphrodite anthem\n\u201cPoker Face\u201d (strangely, the first of five\nbands to cover it that weekend).\nSaturday went by as quickly as Tommy Lee will fuck a fox, as we overslept\nconsiderably; thereby missing Pendulum\u2019s set - who were unsurprisingly\nbrilliant, from what I gathered. I mean,\neverybody blessed with working eyes\nand ears has realized by now what a\ngreat live band they are. Even metal-heads can\u2019t get enough of that sweet\nD\u2019n\u2019B meets rock\u2019n\u2019roll cocktail!\nIf somebody had asked me who the\none person I was looking forward\nto seeing here was, I would have answered without a second of hesitation:\nMarilyn Mother-Fucking Manson. I\nhave listened to that old coot since I\nwas about six, so my undying love for\nhim was probably the main thing that\ndrove me to miss out on three days\nof exam revision to roll around in the\ndirt with a bunch of brain-fried bozos.\nI could go on for hours and probably\neven write a Greek tragedy about how\ngodawfully disappointing it was to see\nmy hopes and dreams from 14 years\nago crushed like a burnt-out cigarette\nby a sad, old junky with girl problems,\nbut I\u2019ll save you the trouble. Manson\nhas become a joke, a real-live parody\nof the twisted persona he invented for\nhimself years ago. Booze and drugs\nhave warped his mind, and with every\ndivorce filed, he lost a bit of his talent and self-respect. The guy doesn\u2019t\neven remember the lyrics to his most\nfamous songs, and as he stumbles off\ninto obscurity midway through set-closer \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d, I\u2019d rather\nremember him as the Metal God he\nonce was. Not as the lonely old loser\nhe is now.\nIn a gobsmacking turn of events,\nthe most violent moshpits were not\nspawned by a metal band, they were\nfor The Prodigy. And rightly so. The\nProdigy was the highlight of my festi-val, no doubt. At one point some guy\nin the moshpit next to us was punching the air in front of him fighting off\ninvisible assailants, until he punched a\nlittle too hard into the fat dude in front\nof him. This bastard turns around and\ngoes straight for the neck, strangling\nthe poor fucker with all his strength.\nAs our kung fu fan was being choked\nto death, a group of ten people jumped\nonto the fat fucker and pounded the\ncrap out of him. This scene was accompanied by the exhilarating breakbeat of\n\"Warrior Dance\", or as Ravi would call\nit: \"TUUUUUUUNE!\"\nBut as thrilling as Prodigy\u2019s sick set\nwas, that night will really be remembered as the night Slipknot had an audience of 80000 riveted for two whole\nhours. Having seen them up close and\npersonal in Hammersmith earlier this\nyear, I did not need to be convinced of\ntheir greatness, and therefore could not\nbe fucked to spend half the show trying to get close enough to see a damn\nthing. So we wandered round the camp\nsite instead, which to be completely\nhonest is just as entertaining. It probably had more sweaty mask-covered\nweirdos too.\nThe ambient noise never usually\nbothers me whilst trying to fall asleep\nat festivals. But that night, the group\nof 10 guys walking back and forth past\nour tent screaming \u201cGet to the chopper!!\u201d and \u201cIf it bleeds we can kill it!!\u201d\nin a thick German accent was just too\nmuch.\nHaving no interest whatsoever\nin Def Leppard, Whitesnake or the\ndouchebags in Trivium, Sunday\u2019s lineup was not my thing. It was only fitting though that such a wild three days\nshould end on the most surreal image\nwhich remains engraved at the back of\nmy brain: every person at that festival\nstanding still with massive hangovers\nand looks of utter boredom. We were\nall being subjected to the entirety of\nJourney\u2019s set, just waiting for that one\nsong. As I stood there unable to take\nmy eyes off the crazy Filipino singer\nrunning back and forth from side to\nside of the stage, coked off his tits, I\npondered about the actual meaning\nof the Festival. A temporary bastion\nof freedom and a shrine to the unifying power of music. For three days\neverybody standing there with me was\nable to let their long, greasy hair down\nand party like they didn't have a care in\nthe world. It usually involved drinking\ntoo much and beating up randoms in\ncircle pits, but still there's a certain undeniable and beautiful simplicity to the\nwhole ordeal. And before I came to any\nlife-changing conclusions, the piano\nriff to that song began to play. It was\nan anthem for the people of Download,\nand maybe even for human beings the\nworld over: \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d. Why\nmetal heads - or anyone else for that\nmatter - would endure 45 minutes of\nutter shite just to hear an 80s power-ballad is beyond me. But as insane as\nit sounds, those tens of thousands of\ngrown men entirely dressed in black\nshouting back every single word of\nthat song with a tear running down\ntheir bloodied and bruised faces was\none of the most touching moments of\nmy life.\n\n"

    "content": "39\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\nSPORT\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNew Club, IC Boxing in the spotlight\nWhat is IC boxing?\nIC boxing is a new sports club, part of\nthe ACC that welcomes anyone and\neveryone willing to participate. There\nhas been strong demand for a boxing\nclub over the past few years, and this\nyear that demand has been met.\nImperial College is well known for\nits academic excellence and the somewhat nerdy students and atmosphere,\nperhaps now we can change the views\nof some and show we have some of the\nbrawn to match our brains.\nWhat does the club do?\nWe are introducing the true basics of\nboxing training. Boxing is not about\nbeating someone to within an inch of\ntheir life; it is about discipline and self-control, which is why the bodies like\nthe military hold it in high regard. It is\nabout fitness and good health.\nBoxing training is one of the best\nforms of cardiovascular exercise,\nwhich is why many sports replicate\naspects of boxing conditioning to their\nown training regimes. So for those who\nwish to slim down and become health-ier, joining IC boxing is the best way.\nFor those who wish to take it to the\nnext level, IC boxing also aims to provide a platform for people to compete\nand create a group of athletes to represent the university.\nWe are a sports society, and do plan a\nnumber of events other than training.\nJoining IC boxing provides a chance\nto meet new people and do something\nprobably never done at Imperial be-fore. We will be organising bar nights,\ndinners and trips to big fights and\ncompetitions such as the second annual London Mayor\u2019s cup held on the\n20th November (for tickets and further\ninformation see contact information)\nWhen and where do we train?\nTraining takes place on Sunday evenings from 4-6pm and is held at the\nAll Stars boxing gym in North Kensington. The nearest tube station is\nQueen\u2019s Park and the bus 28 stops opposite the gym. The sessions are run by\nthree highly respected trainers led by\nIsola Akay MBE.\nThesessionsareastealat\u00a32formembers and only \u00a33.50 for non-members.\nWhat can I expect in a typical\ntraining session?\nThe session will start with a basic\nwarm up and stretches. Considering\nthe fitness level required of a boxer, it\nis harder than it sounds and will make\nthe average Joe sweat within minutes.\nYou\u2019re then introduced to three exer-cises: 3 minute drills of shadow boxing,\nskipping, and working on the punch\nbag. The timing emulates a round of\nan amateur boxing match. Throughout\nthis the coaches will be guiding you on\nthe skills needed in the ring.\nThe final part is the cool down,\nwhich happens to be just as demanding as the warm up.\nDon\u2019t be put off by the high level of\nfitness of boxers though, we welcome\npeople of any standard and if you are\ndedicated and come regularly you will\ncertainly reap the benefits.\nBoxing is a contact sport, so if you\u2019d\nlike do some sparring to see what boxing is really about, a gum-shield is the\nmost important piece of equipment\nyou will need. Headguards and all other essential equipment is provided by\nthe club. However you do not have to\nparticipate in this if you\u2019d rather stay\non the keeping fit and perfecting technique side of things.\nThe club provides boxing gloves and\nskipping ropes, but it is better to have\nyour own gloves for hygiene purposes.\nThe basic equipment required:\n\u2022 Gloves (provided)\n\u2022 Hand wraps\n\u2022 Gum-shield\n\u2022 Towel (if you sweat a lot)\nContact & further information\nIf you are interested, you can find\nfurther information at:\n\u2022 boxing@imperial.ac.uk\nRonald Uzande Boxing\nICUAFCworthit\nastheyprogress\nin BUCS Cup\nPotential competitive Imperial College boxers hard at work at the legendary All Stars gym\nSome of the squad at a L\u2019Or\u00e9al/ICUAFC photoshoot before Wednesday\u2019s game\n\u2022 IC Boxing (Facebook)\nInformation on the All Stars Gym\ncan be found on:\nwww.allstars-gym.co.uk\nThe IC Boxing website is still under\ndevelopment, stay tuned for further\ndetails on its development. See you on\nSunday!\nby the midfield can boss the middle\nof the park and apply the pressure to\nthe Medicals resulting in more goals.\nHopefully.\nThe efforts of keeping the clean\nsheet were dashed 4 minutes into the\nsecond half where the referee dubiously penalised centre back Pat McMullen\nfor a shirt pull on the Medicals striker.\nIt seemed that the change of formation\ndestabilised the team and 4-4-2 was\nquickly reinstated.\nFill-in right back Dion Benincasa\ndelivered a pinpoint delivery to Ferrol\nwho then produced a superb solo effort to complete his hat-trick after 55\nminutes. Tom Fryatt complemented\nhis reliable display in defence with an\nsplitting through-ball to Ferrol who\nduly lifted it over the goalkeeper to\nmake it 7-1 at the 65 minute mark.\nThe Medicals fought on and were\nunlucky not to add to their penalty after capitalising on a 10 minute period\nof sloppy play and a lack of concentration by College. Hints of complacency\nshone through in the second half with\na couple of wayward 35-yard shots\nbut the discipline of College returned\nand was rewarded again after Eshun\nskipped past the Medicals right back\nto deliver yet another pin-point cross\nto Ferrol who scored to complete his\n5-goal haul.\nEshun completed his hat-trick, and\nthe rout for College with another mini-solo effort, latching onto a square pass\nby Alex de Figueiredo, drilling it in\npast the near post after skipping past\n2 players.\nThis 9-1 victory displays the ease\nat which College beat their Medical\nSchool counterparts. However, credit\nmust go to Medicals 2nd XI for keeping up a strong work-rate and determination for the majority of the game.\nThough the gap in quality between the\ntwo sides was immediately evident,\nCollege respected their opponents to\nthe fullest and the affair went largely\nwithout incident.\nAfter a convincing 5-1 win by the\n2nd XI against the University of Essex\nand the 3rd XI enjoying a bye, all three\nICUAFC BUCS representatives will\ncompete in the next round (Round of\n64) of the BUCS Cup.\nImperial College Squad: M.

    "content": "27\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\ntravel.felix@imperial.ac.uk TRAVEL\nI\nt was as though this interview was\ndestined to take place. As I returned from the kitchen with two\nmugs of water, silent in preparation for what was my first ever in-terview, the reflection of dusk in the sea\ncaught me blinded for moments.\nI didn\u2019t need to be reminded that, with\nmy bare feet rubbing against wet sand,\nthat it had been raining throughout the\nweekend, even though it was dry season.\nIvan had set up the recording system\nand gave me the thumbs-up. Ben seemed\nunfazed by the presence of cameras and\ntape recorders \u2013 he is, after all, the veteran and I the novice.\nThe countdown began. Although I feel\nhumbled \u2013 and indeed intimidated \u2013 by\nthe things my interviewee has achieved, it\nwas time to set aside my nerves, man-up\nand take charge. And so it was, the interview with my first extraordinaire.\nDylan Lowe Bula sia everyone, from\nVorovoro, where I\u2019m having my very\nfinal day on this beautiful island. I\u2019m\njoined here by Mr Ben Keene \u2013 very\nnice to have you here.\nBen Keene Nice to have you here Dylan.\nDL Thank you. So why Tribewanted\nin Fiji? It could\u2019ve been in anywhere\nelse in the world.\nBK When we started Google-ing for islands to rent we came up with two places\nwhere we could actually get short-term\nleases for desert islands. One was in the\nPhilippines, and one was here. So we\nbooked two return tickets, one to Manila\nand one to Nadi and were going to decide\nat the last minute which one to go for.\nDL And your decision?\nBK We eventually went for Fiji because,\nfirstly, it\u2019s an English-speaking coun-try; secondly, it\u2019s on the travel route, the\nPhilippines being harder to get to; fi-nally, it\u2019s more politically stable than the\nPhilippines, which is slightly dubious in\nhindsight.\nDL Must say, this was a big business\ngamble with a lot of risks involved.\nBK Yes, but the big risk is to announce to\nthe general public in the UK \u2013 and soon\nafter the rest of the world \u2013 that we are\nattempting to bring together a bunch of\npeople online, and then come to an island\nand build a community. Whichever way\nyou look at it \u2013 brave or na\u00efve \u2013 that was\nthe risk of losing whatever reputation I\nhad, or Mark had at the time. It was then\nfor people to say, \u201cwe\u2019ll watch these kids\nhave a go and fail\u201d \u2013 that was probably\nwhy we had such a big following from the\nstart.\nDL Before you started Tribewanted,\nwhat was your vision of it?\nBK Initially, the idea was simply to say,\nthere were all these different types of\nnew tourism \u2013 community tourism, volunteer tourism, adventure tourism \u2013 that\nhas sprung up in the last twenty years.\nAnd, there is this big new trend in how\nwe communicate because of the inter-net. So the vision is basically to challenge\nourselves to see if we could pull these two\ntrends together and try to create something that would inspire, educate and\nprovide an adventure for us all.\nDL Any different to how it is today?\nBK I think there is a big shift of empha-sis, from people conversing about this\nproject online to actually coming here,\nwith more of the decision-making now\nin the hands of the Fijian people and the\npeople who live here permanently. But I\ndon\u2019t think it\u2019s an experiment any more \u2013\nI think it\u2019s a way of life here.\nDL What would be your ambitious\nplan for the future?\nBK What next.\nDL For Tribewanted.\nBK For me, it has always been the case\nsince day one to have Vorovoro as our\nstarting point. The interests the project\nhas received for the last three years has\nsuggested to me very strongly that we\nshould try to take it to other places. However this is not a project that can simply\nbe copied and pasted to somewhere else\nin the world. This project is unique to this\nisland; it\u2019s unique to the people who live\nhere, and unique to the time that we\u2019ve\ncome to this place and the events that\nhave shaped it. What you can copy is the\nvalues of what we have achieved here: a\nsense of community, and the idea that we\ncan build these cross-cultural villages in\ndifferent parts of the world.\nWhat is so exciting about it is that we\nhave so many people getting in touch\nwith serious proposal from all over the\nworld \u2013 from Borneo to Brazil, Wales\nto Costa Rica, to Indonesia \u2013 who are\ngenuine in their desire to partner up and\ndo similar projects. So I have been doing\na lot of planning in the last year, finding\npartners, and finding models that are financially and environmentally sustain-able. Hopefully, by early 2010, we\u2019ll be\nready for Tribewanted II.\nDL I\u2019m very excited about that.\nBK I hope to see you there. [Laughs] You\ndon\u2019t even know where it is.\nDL No.\nBK Nor do I yet.\nDL One of those things you\u2019ve mentioned is that you are trying to promote tribal culture \u2013 Fijian tribal\nculture to be precise here. In your\nopinion, where should tribal culture\nstand in our increasingly technological world?\nBK What we\u2019re doing here is bringing together those two things. I love technology\nin the way it can change the way you communicate with people, making it easier in\nmaking connections that weren\u2019t possible\nbefore. I also love the idea that we\u2019ve been\ndisconnect from each other because of\nthis technology: because of certain technology we\u2019ve been disconnect from this\nkind of lifestyle, which is how you live in\nbalance with your local environment.\nRather than saying it\u2019s about tribal ways\nof life, it\u2019s more looking at indigenous\npeople who\u2019ve always lived off the land.\nWe automatically say they have a lack of\ntechnology, and a lack of resources; the\nreality is that the local people have this\namazing resource of knowledge that we\nlack. So here in this relaxed environment,\nwe are fusing these new technologies for\nsmarter living, with the local knowledge\nand older ways of living.\nDL I certainly have learnt a lot about\nsustainability during my stay.\nBK What have you learnt?\nDL Nothing\u2019s wasted. This should\nbe the motto of Vorovoro. You were\nin London with team Fiji promoting\nTribewanted \u2013 do tell more?\nBK I have wondered in the back of mind\nas to how to repay some of the amazing\nhospitality we have received from the\nguys here, so when the opportunity came\nup to bring them over and be part of this\nbig garden show, which would fund their\ntrip, four of the boys came over. These\nguys had never left Fiji before \u2013 let alone\ntravel to the other side of the world \u2013 so\nall sorts of interesting things happened.\nDL What were the funniest\nmoments?\nBK There is this one incident that shows\nyou their lack of experience travelling,\nand what is normal here that isn\u2019t back\nin England. It was when Marau [village\nmanager on Vorovoro], as we were leaving England, tried to take a handsaw onto\nthe plane with him \u2013 you know, it was a\nsouvenir he was bringing home to his\nfamily. In his mind it wasn\u2019t a problem, so\none of us mentioned at check-in in Heathrow that, actually, by carrying a hand-saw onto the plane he would never get out\nof England.\nDL [Bursts out laughing]\nBK It was fantastic to have them in the\nUK \u2013 it made you look at your own country in a different point of view. They live\nfor the moment, Fijians \u2013 they are great\nfun to travel with.\nDL We do tend to take things for\ngranted a little to often back home,\ndon\u2019t we?\nBK Everyone takes thing for granted\nwherever they are from. The Fijian people\ntakecertainthingsforgranted\u2013theytake\nfor granted there will probably always going to be fish in the sea. So through little\nprojects here we can share the knowledge\nthat, actually, some fish are dying out;\nthey can in turn tell us there are less of\nthis fish and more of that.\nDL Anyone in particular you would\nlike to thank?\nBK Yourself, Dylan. Because without this\ninterview thing would have been tough.\nAt least you\u2019ve given us a chance to check\nif we\u2019ve got the right stuff in the first aid\nkit.\nDL Flattery aside, anyone?\nBK [Chuckles] The boss man himself,\nTui Mali. He was the one who remem-bered, when the Survivor sea plane landed on the beach two weeks after Mark\nand I had visited, our agreement and told\nthem he had already shaken hands with\nthese backpackers, and it was their lease.\nThere was no contract, and no exchange\nof money by that stage.\nAnd the other key people involved were\nthe first members to sign up. If it wasn\u2019t\nfor their faith \u2013 or blind faith \u2013 this would\nnever have started. So I am grateful to\nthem. And I am also grateful to everyone\nwho has been here.

    "content": "8 felix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCOMMENT\nT\nhe first time my flatmate\nasked me if I thought we\nshould go for a Wii, I very\nnearly tore up my copy of\nthe lease. After the second\ntime he made the suggestion, I changed\nthe locks on the bathroom doors and\ntook to sleeping with a hand grenade\nunder my pillow. It was only on the\nthird time, when as per my instructions he had handwritten his request\nand slid it under my bedroom door,\nthat I finally called off the restraining\norder. In my defence, the confusion\nwasn\u2019t helped by his vague hand-wav-ing gestures, which I feel constituted a\ndecidedly double-edged mime.\nBeing grown men, however, we were\nable to laugh it all off in the best tradition of awkward manly moments. And\ncome the morrow, I was resolved to go\nhunting.\nFrom the moment I stepped outside\nI felt different. The blood was pounding in my head, my stomach started to\ntighten and my nostrils began to flare.\nRough, primal urges which had lain\ndormant for years beneath the facade\nof H&M sweaters and pleated chinos\nviolently overtook my senses.\nWith the frenzy of the chase burning\nthe inside of my skull, and the coursing\nof sweat and adrenaline sending mille-nia of evolution sprawling into the gut-ter, I took the Piccadilly Line towards\nGreen Park and then changed to the\nNorthbound Victoria line for Oxford\nCircus.\n\u201cDrops the wind and stops the mill;\u201d\nremarks little Buttercup with a certain degree of poignancy. As a woman\nclearly possessed of an intimate knowledge of the turbulent emotions that\nexist among our freshwater wildlife,\nshe goes on to point out that \u201cturbot\nis ambitious brill\u201d. True, no doubt, but\nscarcely germane to the issue at hand.\n\u201cGild the farthing if you will,\u201d she adds,\n\u201cyet it is a farthing still\u201d. Ah. Rarely, I\nventure to say, have truer words been\nsung in a contralto register. You can\ntake Man out of the outback, give him\nlanguage, fire and music, teach him\nto substitute spas for spears, Asda for\nadzes and archness for archery, but\nyou can\u2019t take the outback back out of\nMan. Not if you want to remain coher-ent, at any rate.\nWhether enjoying the London light\nfrom the 40th floor of the Gherkin, or\nreading the London Lite at 220 feet\nbelow ground on the Northern Line,\nmodern man is intrinsically the same\nhunter-gatherer as his great100\ngrandfather before him. And there is nothing\nthat gives him as much pleasure as the\nexcuse to have a quick forage.\nHe does not have the patience to\nbrowse. He does not have the tact to\nengage a shop assistant in conversa-tion. He does not have sufficiently\ndeveloped eyesight to differentiate\nbetween Air Force Blue and Cerulean,\nand is not in possession of the glands\nwhich enable him to care. But if you\ngive him something to find, the money\nto buy it with and enough time to get\nlost on the way, he will be as happy and\nmalleable as a lump of Pleistocene.\nAnd as I emerged onto Oxford Street\non the morning in question, with my\nsharpest debit card by my side and\nmy quarry firmly within sight, I took\nmanly, purposeful strides towards the\nHMV. Some short while later, I walked\nout into the evening breeze with a lifeless Wiildebeest in my hand and an\noverwhelming feeling of pride in my\nchest.\nI travelled home, and dumped my\ncatch on the dining room table. \u201cHoney, I\u2019m home!\u201d I bellowed, as I collapsed\ninto the armchair and swung my feet\nonto the desk. I was still picking up\nthe chess pieces when my flatmate\ncame into the room. As he grunted in\nrecognition of my achievement, I let\nhim take care of the very distinctly unmanly task of dealing with the wires\nand plugs and things.\nAnd now it sits, a testament to our\nmasculine heroics, stuffed and framed\nover our mantlepiece between the gilt-edged mirror and the landlady\u2019s collection of scented candles. And as we relax in the evenings, we can be content\nin the knowledge that our adventures\nare behind us, and we now have a Wii\nand a gripping story to tell our chil-dren. Streamlined, smooth and sexy,\noozing with a \u2018pick-up-and-play-me\u2019\nurgency that we both find irresistible.\nThis is still the Wii, of course \u2013 not\nthe unborn and biologically improbable children.\nGilead Amit and his inner Cro Magnon\n\u201cA man can be truly\nhappy if he has\nsomething he needs\nto buy, the money\nto buy it with and\nenough time to get\nlost on the way\u201d\nChump\u2019n\u2019Grind\nDan Wan\nDan Wan Editor-in-Chief\nD\nespite what anyone says\nabout taking a year out\nof your degree, it is not\nthe easy option. I am only\nfinding my job as Editor\nan easier one because I love what this\njob entails; moreso than I do learning\nabout a plant\u2019s photosynthetic cycle or\nthe results of single nucleotide polyp-morphisms. The stresses of being Editor are very similar to the ones associated with a Biology degree. You have\nregular deadlines that only Red Bull will\nallow you to meet and your work will\nbe judged by more than one person.\nHowever, it\u2019s a different kind of stress. If\nthere\u2019s any stress you can enjoy, the one\ncreated from a task you love is the one.\nThe task of turning around a newspaper\nfrom nothing to 48 pages in a week is a\nchallenge I can probably say I love.\nNow this year has produced four is-sues, I\u2019ve started to understand the\nhardships of being responsible for a\npublication where your readership is\nwithin such close quarters to you. Feedback is very easy to give if you personally know the people that write for the\nnewspaper, or it may be the case that\nyou recognise them around College.\nThe majority of people that have approached me to tell a specific writer\nthat they liked their article, or that they\nreally enjoyed reading that week\u2019s felix.\nFor than I\u2019m entirely grateful, and it\ngives ever-more reason to continue to\nwork on felix so hard. However, there\nwas an individual that provoked a dou-ble-edged reaction in me. Only one side\nwas evident, the other suppressed. Recognising me at a Union event, he took\nthe liberty to tell me that last week\u2019s issue had plenty of mistakes. After offering him the chance to avoid a repeat of\nsuch mistakes in that week\u2019s issue and\nthe opportunity to proof-read for fe-lix, he bluntly replied back with \u201cNah,\nthat\u2019s your job.\u201d\nDespite my initial anger at the audacity of his attitude, I eventually realised\nsomething else. My sense of pride for\nfelix has been severely hammered.\nMaybe it was the surprise of the comment amongst the kind sea of positive\nones but I began to appreciate the work\nof past Editors of this fine newspaper;\nhence I must make an apology. Being\nthe try-hard prick I was, and probably\nstill am, I once stormed down to the\nfelix office last year with a red pen in\nhand. Once berating Jovan, then Editor, I slammed down a copy of felix on\nhis desk and began to circle every discrepancy and adjustment that had put\ndetriment to my articles that week. I\u2019m\nvery sure I have already made mistakes\nand much worse than those that I was\nannoyed about last year. After a whole\nweek\u2019s life-threatening slog, seeing\nthe fruits of your labour come Friday\nmorning is one I will appreciate each\nand every week. For someone to disregard the week\u2019s hard work and lack\nof sleep, and to so casually spit nails to\nthe Editor and the editorial team is extremely demoralising. This disregard is\none that both the fellow at the Union\nevent and myself are guilty of.\nOne perk of being Editor is that you\nget to comment upon all ranges across\nthe social spectrum. From the students\nin the Union Building that care about\nthe Union that bit too much to the\nsportsmen outside it, vomiting onto\nthe Quad\u2019s lawn. To comment you\nmust first observe, and eventually you\nget a good feel for society amongst a\nstudent population.\nI know some of the rugby lads think\nthat they deserve an apology from the\nfelix editorial team. They don\u2019t, but I\u2019ll\ngive them this as a consolation: whatever we think about the Imperial rugby\nteam, we should think much worse of\nLSE\u2019s rugby team.\nMaybe it\u2019s the distinct lack of anything green on their campus, or they\ndon\u2019t ever get a moment\u2019s silence being smack-bang in the middle of Central\nLondon, but those boys......those boys.\nOn a recent visit to Crush, LSE Union\u2019s student club night, their rugby\nteam made me envious of the Editorin-Chief of their student newspaper.\nAs the unmistakable snares of the\nBaywatch theme tune started to play\nout, the DJ announced that \u201cthis one\u2019s\nfor the rugby boys\u201d. Like an instruction\nfrom the training pitch, an assortment\nof guys all ran onto the stage together,\nstripped their top-halves bare and started to wildly swing their shirts above\ntheir heads. Ironic or not, they were not\na team who could get away with re-en-acting an onstage surge familiar to a gay\nclub without looking massively camp.\nAnd as the soundtrack mixed into\nKings of Leon\u2019s \u2018Sex on Fire\u2019, the 20-odd\nboys on stage found themselves still\ntopless, arms still around each other,\nshirts now hanging limply by their side\nand stuttering awkwardly to each other\n\u201cyou, you, you, your sex is on fire.\u201d\nAs they returned to the masses of\nthe dancefloor to once again make the\noverall sex ratio about 80:20 in favour\nof men, it made me laugh to no end. If\nonly the Imperial rugby lads were that\ndisillusioned to pull off such an \u2018ironic\u2019\nstunt, Hangman would have material\nfor many a cat\u2019s lives.\n\u201cAn assortment of guys\nall ran onto the stage,\nstripped their top-halves\nbare and started to wildly\nswing their shirts above\ntheir heads.\u201d\n\n"

    "content": "25\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk GAMES\nTonight, felix, I\u2019m... Manuel Calavera\nNovember 1st marks Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead, and to celebrate this Jack Warren is stepping into the suit and\nbow tie of a man who knows all about being dead \u2013 Grim Fandango\u2019s leading corpse, Manny Calavera.\nO\nne of the first things you\ncan get Manuel Calavera to say in this game\nis the description of a\ndeck of marked cards.\n\u201cThis deck of cards is a little frayed\naround the edges. Then again, so am I.\nAnd I\u2019ve got fewer suits.\u201d\nManuel \u2018Manny\u2019 Calavera is an unlucky chap. Having not led a good\nenough life to afford a trip to eternal\nrest, he\u2019s stuck in the land of the dead\ntrying to find his way to the other side\nby working as a travel agent \u2013 for the\nlast trip people ever make. Each sale\ngives him a little commission towards\na trip for himself, but he\u2019s not been getting many \u2018moral\u2019 people in, and they\u2019re\nthe ones with money to spend in the\nafterlife. It\u2019s a very LucasArts tale, and\ntheir last hurrah in the point-and-click\ngenre is a reminder of everything they\nand designer Tim Schafer did so well.\nManny\u2019s quite literally stuck in a\ndead-end job. But when a woman dies\nand ends up in his office looking for a\nway out, corruption in Manny\u2019s office\nsees her being turned away. He leaves\nhis job and treks for four years through\nthe treacherous afterworld in search of\nher.\nIt\u2019s this expanse of time \u2013 each year\ncomprises one act within the game \u2013\nthat makes Manny such a wonderful\ncharacter. He flits between every role in\nthe seedy, jazz-infused film noir world\nhe inhabits \u2013 sometimes a detective,\nsometimes a smooth-talking club own-er, sometimes a hopeless romantic. And\nyet all the while there\u2019s a bit missing. Secretly, he\u2019s still on your side.\nIt\u2019s partly the well-judged humour of\nthe superb Schafer, but Manny\u2019s attitude to his crusade for love and retribution is always slightly mocking, slightly\nbemused. It\u2019s a great thing for a character to have \u2013 particularly in the surreal\nworld of Grim Fandango. Whether it\u2019s\nperforming a faux-angsty poem at a jazz\nbar\u2019s open mic night or goading a gigantic demon mechanic into nearly killing\nhimself on drilling equipment, Manny\nreacts to the world with the same mix\nof bemusement and inquisitiveness that\nyou will.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say he\u2019s not serious, because he can be, and so can the game\nitself. But Manny always makes sure it\nremains a LucasArts game at heart. He\nkeeps it smiling.\n\u201c...truly\nimportant and\ntruly special...\u201d\nHe\u2019s the game\u2019s single, comforting\nconstant \u2013 the sharply-dressed, Spanish-accented wisecrack who thinks\npretty much like you do. He can be\nnice, but he\u2019s not averse to manipulating the stupid either, as long as it works\nout okay in the end. He\u2019ll do dumb stuff,\ntoo, if you ask him to, but he\u2019ll always\nfollow it up with a joke that reminds you\nwho suggested the stupid thing (\u201cI just\nlocked an open door. Strange, yet symbolically compelling.\u201d) and when a game\ninvolves giant cat races and labour\nunions comprised of bumblebees and\nstrangely sombre metaphors for death\n\u2013 you \u2018sprout\u2019 and become covered with\nflowers before dying, a second time,\npermanently \u2013Manny\u2019s occasional nods\nand winks to camera are reassuring,\nnecessary.\nHe works as a game character because\nhe\u2019s got a personality without smothering the player with it. You enjoy playing\nhis role, but at the same time you feel\nlike you\u2019d do the same, really. For a game\nbased on linearity, that\u2019s important.\nGrim Fandango has one of the best\nstories ever told in a videogame. Manny\nis both the protagonist and your link to\nthe story, and that makes him truly important and truly special. Don\u2019t wait for\nLucasArts to re-release it on Steam \u2013 go\nandfinditnow,whereveritcanbefound.\nManny is an unforgettable character. Manny, left, and his long-suffering companion Glottis at the piano, in Year Two\nIW: No multiplayer in MW2\nfelix talks to Infinity Ward\u2019s Robert Bowling about the new and\ncontroversial changes to be made to the blockbuster winter hit\nL\neading on from their unusual announcement about\nthe lack of dedicated server\nsupport for Modern Warfare 2, we asked Robert\nBowling, PR for Infinity Ward, about\nhis plans for the future.\n\u201cWe loved multiplayer in Modern\nWarfare, we did, but we\u2019re looking to\nthe future,\u201d Rob explains, \u201cPlayers don\u2019t\nwant the stress of playing against people who might be better than them, or\nhaving to communicate with human\nbeings. No-one likes that. So we\u2019re\nexcited to announce that we\u2019re going to\nslowly patch out multiplayer over the\nfirst month of the game\u2019s release.\u201d\nHe pulls out a lighter, lights a ten dollar bill, and then uses it to light some incense sticks. Made of gold and fairy skin.\n\u201cAt first, we\u2019ll just be replacing the other players with bots,\u201d he continues, \u201cBut\nover time we\u2019re hoping to cut the system\ndown so they\u2019re replaced with immobile\ncardboard cut-outs. We\u2019ve done some\nplaytesting, and a lot of our focus groups,\nparticularly those for domesticated animals and the clinically dead, found that\na lot more fun. It\u2019s exciting. I\u2019m excited.\nAre you excited? Be more excited.\u201d\nI ask him about about the clan com-munities, and got two thumbs up in\nreturn.\n\u201cOh, we\u2019re super supportive of \u2018em.\nWe\u2019ve got a sweet clan mode that allows you to play with up to three people on the same television. Exciting,\nright? Or at least, we\u2019ll have that feature for a couple of months. Around\nChristmas we\u2019ll be replacing it with a\nmode where you just walk around multiplayer maps alone, on patrol. I mean,\na lot of people don\u2019t like split screen.\nWe want to give everyone the benefit\nof multiplayer maps, without the frustration of actually having to see other\nhuman beings, or anything.\u201d\nI nod sagely as two scantily-clad\nwomen bring in three cups of golden\nliquid and proceed to massage it into\nhis thighs.\n\u201cAnd looking further ahead, we\u2019ll\nprobably include an XBox 360 in the\nsystem requirements for Modern Warfare 3. You know, it\u2019s about providing\nthe absolute best experience for, uh, for\nour programmers. Yeah. By making the\nPC version of the game actually run on\nthe XBox 360, you get all the benefits\nof giving us money to make hats out\nof, and none of the frustrating fads that\nmade Modern Warfare so irritating,\nyou know, like challenge or enjoyment.\nRob smiles broadly and looks like\nRob and friends, at the BAFTAs.\na man with a vision. A modern-day\nBarack Obama, only for games and a\ncomplete tosser.\n\u201cBasically, by the time we get to\nModern Warfare 5, we\u2019re hoping to\nhave streamlined the process down\nto just selling empty DVD cases. That\nway, no-one has to waste time actually writing about our games, and we\ncan just get down to the important bit\nabout giving us cash.\u201d\nModern Warfare 2 is due out on November 10th\nWrite For Us!\nWhat makes you pick up a pad\nand play?\nWhat makes Angry Internet\nMen so damn angry, anyway?\nIf you\u2019ve got something to say,\nsay it in Felix Games - email us\nat games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "7\nfelix FRIDAY 30 OCTOBER 2009\nCOMMENT\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nT\nis the season for dressing up like a retard and\nspending lots of monies\nfor the privilege of doing\nso. By this, I am of course\nreferring to, \u2019fancy dress\u2019. If you\u2019re a\ngirl this could also be interpreted as\n\u2018slutting-it-up-good-and-proper\u2019 and\nwith Halloween soon approaching we\nwill probably see a lot of horny witches\nabout. Evidently I am not a fan. Thus\nmy efforts in this pursuit have been\nlack luster to say the least; my most recent foray involved a T-shirt I got for\nfree, some Primark tights and a sign\nmade out of used jotter pad paper coloured in with highlighters.\nYou know; it is not all BAD news. IF\npeople really put effort into their costumes and make them themselves, (in-stead of buying the tacky nylon outfits;\nPET. HATE) it can be pretty darn good.\nBut who is going to do that? \u201cMe\u201d\u2026\nQuiet you! Unless it is your party or\nyou are trying to attract a costume fetishist for a mate, then the motivation\njust is not there.\nI have no problem however, with\nfancy dress, where the definition pertains to formal attire. Now you\u2019ve got\nme listening! If only for the reason I\nam far less likely to behave badly when\nadorned in a sophisticated cocktail\ndress compared to a baggy t shirt, already red, thereby eliminating the fear\nof the \u2018snaky-B-splash!\u2019\nThere are pro\u2019s and con\u2019s to the male\ndress code in either of the \u2018fancy dress\u2019\nenvironments. Some credit must be\nawarded to those guys who take the\nidea of dressing up and throw it out\nthe window\u2026along with their clothes\nit seems! Cover yourself in dirt or spatter on some war paint and you have an\noutfit right there, no garments neces-sary. However being the romanticist\nand fantasist that I can indeed be, a\nman in a good tux, looking suave and\nstanding proud oozes that old school\nglamour. Like a slowly exhaled ciga-rette; something about it, is just fucking good.\nBack to the idea of stripping bare\nfor a special occasion, I don\u2019t suppose you have heard about the new\nbody scanning machines in airports?\nHmm, LOL. No hiding those tiny\npackages now boys! Or chicken fillets\ngirls. Manchester airport is piloting\nthis pervy device, said to reduce waiting times in airports. Well, at least we\nhave our priorities straight; convenience over class and decency. Forgive\nmy prejudice; in fact I would not really\ncare, it would be over quickly and because you cannot see the scanner and\nwill never meet the person looking at\nthe scanner ; really it is like they never\nsaw the outline of your genitals at all. It\nis similar to the tree falling in the for-est, if no one heard it; it is like it never\nmade a sound. Therefore I propose, for\nanyone that has a problem with this\nnew technology, reassure themselves\nwith the comforting notion that if you\nare never confronted with the image or\nmocked for the sight you are, to all intensive purposes it has not happened.\nYou create your own reality.\nNeedless to say, that is a load of crap\nand the people in the little office with\nthe scanner will undoubtedly have\ntheir feet up while chowing down on\nDoritos laughing at your expense.\nNot just that, it raises the issue of\nwhether children should be scanned,\nor whether there should be a background check for those with scanner\nclearance. But then if you allowed children to bypass the scanner, we could\nload our kids up with guns and coke\nand have a whale-of-a-time! Or else\u2026\nsubject them to the pat down; but the\npaedo-patrol would not be down with\nthat either.\nVicki Masding has a steady flow of trash\n\u201cGuys who take the\nidea of dressing up\nand throw it out\nthe window\u2026along\nwith their clothes it\nseems!\u201d\nI\nn the second part of our guide to\nStudent life, (see last week\u2019s \u2018Paper trails\u2019) we tackle the notion\nof left/right-wing. How do you\nknow if you are L-W, or R-W?\nWhat does it mean?\nAt some point, you will have to decide on Port or Starboard. Basically,\nsomeone will ask you. Or you\u2019ll say\nsomething you think is completely\nreasonable and they\u2019ll call you a snivelling lefty, or a Nazi fascist. You need\nto know whether to refute this accusation or defend it. Which of these you\nchoose to do makes you L- or R-W.\nQuite apart from how you conduct\nyourself in a verbal hoo-hah down the\npub, your decision has consequences\noutside of your actual political posi-tion. For example being L- or R- ultimately decides whether you read the\nGuardian or the Times; the Mirror or\nthe Mail. Your decision determines\nwhether you buy recycled toilet paper\nor Andrex; goats cheese or Stilton.\nObviously you need to be well-in-formed before you choose. Unfortunately, the problem with trying to give a\nstraightforward definition of L-/R-W is\nthat being one or the other means taking on a set of characteristics which are\nthemselves determined by a consensus\namongst the people who claim that al-legiance. That is to say that the definition is circular: the people that are L-W\nare L-W because they do L-W things;\nL-W things are the things which L-W\npeople do. (Similarly for R-W.)\nGaz is Left Wing. He can\u2019t believe how\ndisgusted he is about the Iraq War. He\nmakes sure to pop into Waitrose to pick\nup his Guardian and packet of Fairtrade\ncoffee because he knows that Waitrose\nis a co-operative and has ethical policies on the sourcing of its meat (which\nhe does not eat). He doesn\u2019t know what\nhe\u2019s going to vote at the next election\nbecause on the one hand, he can\u2019t believe how disgusted he is about the Iraq\nWar, but on the other hand, you\u2019ve got\nto keep the Tories out, haven\u2019t you?\n(Perhaps he remembers something his\nmother said about Thatcher stealing the\nmilk.)\nFelicity is Right Wing, She picks\nup her copy of the Telegraph at the\nWhole Foods Company, because she\ncan get her Organic Baby Food at the\nsame time. \u2018Felicity is disgusted in\nequal measure by inheritance tax and\nthe amount of knife crime. The latter\nshe blames on single mothers and illegal immigrants, whom she believes\nto be spending their benefit money on\nbuying and sharpening the knives that\nthey will use to try to stab her outside\na nightclub. She knows that she\u2019s not\na racist, because one of her friends recently married a third generation Indian woman. Nonetheless, she feels that\nsomeone really ought to do something\nabout all those Burqas: \u2018I mean, how\nwould we know if they were carrying\nbombs under those things?\u2019\nWhat if you don\u2019t feel much affinity\nwith either of these positions? Maybe\nyou think Gaz is a snivelling lefty and\nFelicity is a Nazi fascist. Then you are\ncalled a Centrist. This is a similar disease to Agnosticism and must be addressed immediately. If you feel you\nhave caught Centrism, the solution\nis to just pick a side and deal with it.\nFor freaks\u2019 sake, it\u2019s like hand-wringing\nwhen Man U play Arsenal, because you\njust can\u2019t decide which team you like\nthe best. Make your bloody mind up\nand start screaming at someone.\nIn making your decision, perhaps it\nwould be helpful to take inspiration\nfrom some famous examples of L- or\nR-W people.\nFamous L-W\u2019ers include, Tony Benn,\nKarl Marx, Robin Hood, Dire Straits,\nCharlie Brooker, Thomas the Tank Engine and the Hamburgler of McDonalds\nfame.\nFamous R-W\u2019ers include Enoch Powell, Hitler, Boris Johnson, The Sheriff of\nNottingham, Gordon the Big Engine,\nthe entire county of Berkshire and\nKFC\u2019s Colonel Sanders,\nBecause of the identification of L-W,\nR-W, Centre, with Labour, Conservatives and Liberal-democrats respec-tively, a colour scheme has emerged.\nThus Red is L-W, Yellow in the Centre\nand Blue on the R.\nThese colour associations have been\nexploited. In the late nineties, it was\nfelt that political apathy threatened to\nundermine democracy. Thus a plan\nwas formed to indoctrinate children\ninto political factions. The Tellytubbies\nwas the flagship of this movement. Yellow Tellytubby Laa-Laa, as his or her\nname suggests, is a Lib-dem. Red Po\nwas staunch Old Labour until he started switching his second home allowance to avoid capital gains tax, On the\nother hand, Eurosceptic Tinky-winky\nis known to be forming alliances with\nneo-fascist Polish broadcasters called\nCzewska-czewskis. Dipsy was played\nby Green activist Si\u00e2n Berry.\nLastly, in case it had occurred to you\nthat the whole L-/R- business is rather\narbitrary or silly and obscures the real\nissues that should be debated in favour\nof an oversimplification into a lazy binary decision for the benefit of idiots,\nthen remember: politics is not about\nopen debate, it\u2019s about picking the guy\nin the red or blue corner and cheering\nuntil he knocks the other one out.\nDavid Stewart asks\u2018theMirroroftheMail?\u2019\n\u201cYou\u2019ll say something you think\nis reasonable and\nthey\u2019ll call you a\nsnivelling lefty, or a\nNazi fascist.\u201d\n\n"
