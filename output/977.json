How can human beings do such\nsenseless, stupid things?! \"Uh...the plan went\nwrong - the bomb wasn't supposed to go off that\nearly - we even lost one of our own men.\" Now\nI 've only lived here for three years so far and I admit that I have never bothered to find out\nmore about the Irish-British situation. However,\nI am aware that this tension or, frankly this\nproblem has existed for years now. It is a problem. Why has little been done concerning\nthe situation?\nWhat has caused children to suffer and die -what have they done to deserve this? Before a smart-alec reader answers \"c 'est la vie\" I must\nagree with him - YES that is life. It's too\nprecious to waste and so why aren't we doing\nsomething to stop pointless deaths.\nIn the wake of peace across the world, Eire\nand Britain should follow suit. Looking back on\nthe past few years, East-West Germany is re-unified; there's the break-up of the USSR; Arabs\nand Israelis are making peace...So why can't we? It seems to me that the world watches the\nproblems of the non-western countries but\n(conveniently?) ignores their own.

Kwality Tandoori.\nThe best curry house in London! They can put\nup with a bunch of marauding students arriving\nat any time during the evening and will serve\nyou with a smile. Do not piss these people off,\nthey have given the students of Imperial a sturdy\nservice long before you were out of nappies.\nYou can eat here for around \u00a37 without beer,\n\u00a310 - \u00a315 with.\n2. Kensington Market\nKensington Market is a good place to shop if\nyou are a poor down-trodden student. It sells\nmainly goth and grunge wear, earrings and\nanything vaguely connected with the occult. You\ncan even have yourself tattooed in the basement\nand then cheaply fed on the first floor. The shop\nkeepers are willing to barter on the price and as\nall the shops sell the same stuff you can battle\nthem off against each other for bargains.\n3. Hyper Hyper\nHyper Hyper is very similar to Kensington\nMarket but is about twice the price. If you have\nmoney it is great for ball dresses and cocktail\ndresses as they are all unique, so there is no\nchance of the em baras s ment of someone turning\nup in the same outfit as you. They are, however,\na little off the wall and so are not for the more\nconservative amongst us. They also sell wigs\nand shoes at extortionate prices so you could\nreally go to town with your image.\n4. Harts\nHarts is heaven if you find you self stuck in the\nmiddle of the night with the munchies and\nnothing to eat. For those of you living in Evelyn\nGardens, it will be almost impossible to resist\npopping in to buy one of their spit roast chickens\non your way back from one of the Union's parties. They are open 24 hours a day, seven\ndays a week and sell everything. Somebody give\nthem a medal.\n5.7-Eleven\nThis is pretty much the same as Harts although a little more expensive in some areas and lacking\nin spit roast chickens. However, they do sell\nmore in the way of magazines and newspapers to\ngive them a plus point.\n6. Cullens\nCullens isn't as great as Harts or 7-Eleven\nbecause it closes at midnight. I only put them in\nto tell you that they sell great cheap croissants.\n7. Pasta Sugo\nPasta Sugo is a nice cheap rest u a rant that your\nmother would be proud of you suggesting. You\ncan eat well for about \u00a310 per head and their\npasta dishes are absolutely fabulous. It is also\nsuitable for those more intimate moments with\nthe girl whose name you can hardly remember.\n8. Hoop & Toy\nThe Hoop & Toy is a huge pub but a little overpriced for the quality of the beer. It seems that\neverytime we do a pub crawl we finish in the\nHoop. Because of its size they have no qualms\nabout a large group of pissed students being sat\nin the corner.\n9. Anglesea Arms\nThe Anglesea was one of the new age yuppie\nplaces back in the 80s. It now seems to have\nsettled down a bit, although you still get the odd\nmobile phone. It has a beer garden and also a little old lady (who has probably been there\nsince the place was built) who wanders around\ncollecting empty glasses and scaring off the\nundesirables who sit outside singing loud and\nobnoxious bar songs. She works better than any\nbouncer I 've ever seen.\n10. Queen's Arms\nThe Queen's, as it is better known, seems to be\nan extension of the Union Bar.

    "content": "News\nDa Vinci's Loses Bar Manager Constitution Passed\nTrevor Phillips, an old ICU President, opening the newly refurbished\nDa Vinci's Bar at the start of last year.\nAfter two years of sterling service, Andrew Flanagan, Union Bar Manager,\nhas relinquished his position, writes Owain Bennallack.\nCiting illness as his reason for departure, Mr Flanagan expressed his\nsadness at leaving Imperial College. He went on to say that he had never\nworked with a group of people as pleasant as the ICU staff team. In his two\nyears as manager he re vitali sed bar trade, an achievement which directly\nallowed for the creation of Da Vinci's in its current form.\nEveryone in Felix and the Union wish him a full recovery and all the\nbest in his future endeavours. The Union would like to thank Ian Richards\nwho has covered as Bar Manager, Yvonne Woods for taking on extra\ncatering responsibilities and the part time bar staff for all their efforts.\nRector Speaks\nBY DAVID SPOONER\nLast week's Commemoration Day\nsaw the first public address by\nProfessor Sir Ronald Oxburgh as\nRector since taking over from\nProfessor Sir Eric Ash in\nSeptember.\nSpeaking to this year's grad-u at es, he first addressed proposals\nmade at last year's Commemoration\nDay by his predecessor. Last year,\nSir Eric spoke of the possibility of\nImperial College d is affiliating from\nthe University of London and\ndescribed the federal structure as\n\"sterile\" and \"unproductive\". In\ncontrast, Sir Ronald seems to have\nadopted a most cautious approach,\ndeclaring an earnest hope that \"we\nwill not feel obliged to initiate the\nprocedures that would lead to our\nwithdrawal\".\nSir Ronald went on to say that if\nImperial College withdrew, other\nmajor colleges would be likely to\ndo so as well. He stated that this\nwould result in \"a depressing and\ninglorious end for a great\ninstitution\".\nImperial College has been a member of the University of\nLondon since 1908, following the\ncombining of three of the\nConstituent Colleges into Imperial\nCollege. All three colleges did,\nhowever, issue University of\nLondon degrees prior to the merger.\nSpeaking further, Sir Ronald\nOxburgh remarked on accountability and that measuring the\nacademic, as opposed to the\nfinancial, success of a college could\ncreate misleading conclusions.\nThere was a real danger, he said,\nthat a system of higher education\nthat was marvellously accountable,\neducationally correct, but\nirretrievably pedestrian could\nbecome a reality.\nBY ANDREW TSENG,\nNEWS EDITOR\nThe new constitution of Imperial\nCollege Union (ICU) has finally\nbeen passed. The Union General\nMeeting ( U GM) held last week\nheralded a reformed ICU. It also\nprovided a warning to those\nopposed to the Constituent College\nUnions (CCU) of the strength of the\nC CU support.\nUnder the old constitution, any\namendments to the constitution had\nto go through two UGMs. The first\noccurred at the end of last term\nwhen Chris Davidson, the then ICU\nPresident, proposed the new\nconstitution. The second reading\ntook place last Friday, at the first\nU GM of this term. It was passed by\na majority of over 300. Quorum for\nthe meeting was 300.\nThe strength of the CCUs was\nfelt when the first amendment to the\nconstitution was put to the meeting.\nThe proposal removed various\nmajor and minor sub-committee\nchairs from the Executive\nCommittee of ICU( SCC, SCAB, Rag, AC C,RC C), placed the\nPresidents of the three South\nKensington CC Us onto the\nExecutive Committee and removed\nthe C CU Executive Committees as\nsubcommittees of ICU.\nDuring the proceedings it was\nproposed that the amendment be\nitself amended by not placing the\nPresidents of the three CCUs onto\nthe Executive Committee. However, this was turned down by an\noverwhelming majority which\nincluded over 200 members of the\nRS M and 100 members of the RCS.\nThe original amendment, with\nthe additional removal of the\nEntertainments Chair from the\nExecutive Committee, was carried\nalmost unanimously. Under the new\nconstitution, any amendments need\nonly be passed at one U GM for it to\nbe considered as passed.\nFor the new constitution to\nofficially come into effect, it must\nbe ratified by the Board of\nGovernors. The next meeting of the\nBoard of Governors will take place\nearly next month.\nICU Fights Reforms\nBY PAUL DIAS\nImperial College Union (ICU) has\noutlined its intended course of\naction regarding the student union\nreforms proposed by John Patten,\nthe Secretary of State for\nEducation. This follows the\napproval of a motion at last\nFriday's Union General Meeting.\nThe motion resolved to make ICU\nresponsible for lobbying any\nnecessary parties as to the role of\nstudent unions and how they will be\naffected by the proposed Higher\nEducation Student's Charter.\nAndrew Wensley, ICU President, described the reforms\nand their potential effects in last\nweek's Felix. At this week's ICU\nExecutive Committee meeting, the\nfirst moves to be made by ICU were\nagreed.\nFirstly, the Academic Affairs\nOfficers will ensure that all students\nare aware of the possible impact of\nany changes made by the\nGovernment. This will be carried\nout through the Departmental\nRepresentatives and Academic\nRepresentatives in each department.\nSecondly, they will organise\npetitions to be signed by students\nexpressing ICU's reservations over\nthe proposed reforms. The petitions\nwill be distributed around College\nin the near future.\nMr Wensley said: \"I'm very\npleased with the response from\nstudents and from College, and I just hope that the Government\nlistens to these comments for once.\"\nTickets are still available (free of charge) if anyone\nwishes to attend the speech by the Labour Leader\n(Rt. Hon.) John Smith, MP, organised by the\nSave British Science Society on 17th November.\nPlease contact:\nMrs Eeles, Room 209, (Physics Dept.)\nTel: 071 589 5111 ext 6933 or 071 225 8860.\nWe apologise for incorrectly printing the extension number last week.\nThe deadline for letters to Felix is Monday, 6pm "

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 21\nSouth Downs\nBy Bike\nAt twenty past eight on Saturday morning, four\npeople, with four hangovers and about twenty\nhours sleep between them, met at Prince's Gardens before setting off to catch a train from\nVictoria to the South Downs Way, which goes\nfrom Eastbourne to Petersfield passing over\nalmost every hill on an 85 mile journey.\nThree miles after the start one of us had a puncture on the first downhill section and we\nhad to endure the sniggers of crowds of walkers.\nWe had the last laugh, though, as ten minutes\nlater we caught up to them and we found out\nhow difficult it was to slow down without a brake being attached to the bike.\nDespite the growing wind, abysmal map\nreading skills and James's panniers being held\non only by bungee cords, we arrived at the\nYouth Hostel a mere eight hours after starting to\nride. It was there that Thomas Sceffl told us all\nthat he normally did forty miles a day in training\nfor the World Cup races and that he wasn't stiff\nat all. Some of us hadn't done any proper\ntraining for four months.\nThe next day the wind had dropped and the\ntrails were much faster, passing through\nwoodland with some screaming descents and\nkiller climbs. Congratulations to James Arthur\nfor beating us up most of them, despite having a twenty stone dinosaur for a bike.\nWith ten miles to go, and Thomas worsening\nfrom suspected food poisoning, we left the trail\nand took to the roads which also helped relieve\nour saddle sores.\nThanks to all concerned for taking part.\nMatch Results The results of matches\nplayed on Wednesday\nafternoons can be put\ninto Felix if they are\nhanded into the Felix\nOffice no later than\n8pm on Wednesday\nevening.\nMake The Most Of The\nCulture Capital\nNow that you are in the culture capital of\nBritain, what are you going to do about it? If\nyou are not careful, you will finish the year\nthinking, \"I wish I had gone to see that,\" or\nworse still, \"I couldn't find anyone to go with to\nsee that and there was no way I'd go on my\nown,\"!\nThe Imperial College Arts Appreciation\nSociety is for you to take advantage of many of\nthe excellent facilities London has to offer. We\nrecognize how tough it can be on a grant and the\nUnion gives us a grant which allows us to chop\nup to 40% off tickets.\nWe are a completely independent society and\nthat means we can organise any trip which you\nwant. We aim for at least one show a week.\nAlready planned shows include:\nAn Inspector Calls\nArcadia\nThe Comedy Store\nPaul Merton Live\nGrease\nFive Guys Named Moe\nMiss Saigon\nThe Magic Flute\nPhantom of the Opera.\nThere will be more opera and ballet next term!\nIf you are interested in seeing any of the\nabove, or if you have suggestion of your own,\ncome along to the Union Dining Hall between\n12.30pm and 1.30pm on Mondays where a warm welcome, including a cup of tea and\nchocolate biscuits, is guaranteed.\nMemberships costs only \u00a33 and will probably\nbe made up for on your first trip. Elections for\nabout three positions on the committee are being\nheld soon - see our noticeboard on the Walkway\nnear the Bookstore. If you have any queries you\ncan contact us in our pigeonhole in the Union\nOffice: Harsh Pershad (Chem II), Craig Brierly\n(Phys II), Eleanor Corran (Chem Eng III), Dan\nSlattery (Comp III), Helen Roberts (Bio II),\nBecky Cotton (Chem Eng II).\nOnce you have joined we will send you a weekly newsletter that will keep you up to date\nwith our events.\nShake It With The Best\nTonight, Friday 29th October, Atmosphere rears\nits ugly head again at the Union. After the first\nsell out, I'd advise you to arrive early to ensure\nentry. The music runs for 8pm straight through\n'til 2am and those happy guys down at the Met.\nhave given us a bar extension 'til lam. The\nhappy hour runs between 8pm and 9pm where\nall drinks will be reduced by 20%. Entry is a paltry \u00a31 which guarantees a night packed full of\nexcitement.\nIt must be remembered that there is a strict\nNo Re-Admission policy on these nights; if you\ngo out through the main gates you have to pay\nanother quid to get back in. Also, every Friday\nnight, both bars are included in the event and\nthus you can only get to the bar by going to the\nevent and paying to get in.\nThis is you last chance to catch Atmosphere\nfor a couple of weeks as we take a break and let\nRag and Guilds take over the next two Fridays.\nBut lovers of the Ents Groove should not fear\n'cos our usual Monday night theme disco and\nClub Libido on Wednesday will carry on\nregardless. So, when you get tired of the Beer\nFestival, join us at the Union and shake it with\nthe best.\nCandyman - ICSF's Next Film\nCandyman, our bumper fun not-quite-Halloween-but-almost film, is adapted from\nClive Barker's short story 'The Forbidden' and,\nunlike many book to screen translations, comes\nacross very well.\nThe story is about urban myth and gives an\norigin to the 'killer with the hook', a slave\nhorribly tortured, who lives on through ritual\nfear and whispered rumour. Within his kingdom,\na labyrinthine housing project, the Candyman is\na name to terrify children, an object for\nplac a tory tributes of 'sweets to the sweet' and a subject of graffiti, in particular a huge mural on\nthe wall of an apartment which was the scene of\na grisly murder.\nInto the projects' community comes a researcher intrigued by the Candyman's story -myth or reality, scare mongering or justified\nterror? And is she becoming part of some mass\nhallucination or is she really being stalked by a vengeful spirit, a never-dying king seeking a queen?\nFind out on Tuesday 2nd November at 7pm. The cost is \u00a31.20 to ICSF members and \u00a31.80 to\neveryone else. Membership is \u00a33.00 and this\ngets you free entry to one of our films along\nwith the opportunity to borrow some of our\n3000-odd books and videos.\nBring a hand to hold.\nA review of the Gigolo Aunts' latest album is on page 6\n\n"

    "content": "Feature 11\nand serves the cheapest pint outside College.\nYou will find the usual motley crew of students\nin there. It never has Karioke or quiz nights and\nis always busy. The beer is well kept and varied,\nand you're bound to make it in there at some\npoint during your time here.\n11. Gloucester Arms\nThe Gloucester Arms is not as cheap as the\nQueen's, and has Karioke evenings at least once\na week. It also has a bar-billiards table\n(positioned rather awkwardly next to the toilets)\nat a cost of \u00a31 per game, each lasting twenty\nminutes. It is rarely visited by students but is\nalways good for a pub crawl.\n12. Merry Go Down\nThe Merry Go Down is probably not the best or\ncheapest pub in town, but it does have an\nambiance all of its own. It is quiet most of the\ntime - even on Fridays. It is tucked away in a back street of Gloucester Road and so it is great\nfor escapism. It also has the bonus of MTV. Good quality beer and Merry Down cider on tap.\n13. Stanhope Tavern\nThe Stanhope is a nightmare. It graces us with\nKarioke at least three times a week and is always\npacked wall to wall with lager louts who think\nthey are big and clever 'cos they can drink ten\npints and then 'sing' a classic hit loudly.\n14. Harrington\nThe Harrington is a pleasant little pub with a nice atmosphere and a pool table. It does get\nvery busy but always in a friendly sort of way.\nThe beer is pretty reasonable, both in taste and in\nprice, but they don't have much of a selection.\nBasically it's Courage Best or Directors with a supply of Fosters for the lager s will ers.15. Hereford\nThe Hereford is a small but friendly pub. It is\nnot over priced and the beer is of very good\nquality. There is also a good selection of the\nstuff to sample. Its only problem is that it is\ngenerally a middle aged pub and so is never\nheaving with young talent.\n16. Luigi Malone's This is a sort of Italian-cum-Tex-Mex place on\nBrompton Road and is one of the best places to\neat in South Kensington. It has a large menu and\nlarge plates, so be warned. The cost is around\n\u00a315 for a main course, starter and couple of\nbeers. The atmosphere is very relaxed and there\nis a bar that serves expensive but tasty cocktails.\nOn Monday there is a happy hour when all the\ndrinks at the bar are half price.\n17. Texas Lone Star\nThis is obviously a Tex-Mex place. The food is\ngreat and there is plenty of it, although it isn't the cheapest place around. You'd expect to pay\naround \u00a315 if you have a starter, main course\nand a bottle of beer. The place gets very busy\nafter 7pm most nights, especially on weekends,\nbut it does have a bar that you can lounge around\nin if you have the money to spend on nasty\ncocktails.\n18. Chan's Chan's is an 'eat as much as you like' place. At\n\u00a34.50 per person it provides a very limited buffet\nthat you can visit as many times as you like.\nOpen all day, it is a nice cheap alternative meal\nbut beware if you eat just before they fill the\ntrays up - you may find that there is actually no\npork in the sweet and sour pork dish and instead\nyou end up with a plate of carrots and onions\ncovered in orange g loop.19. Mongolian Barbeque\nThe Mongolian Barbeque is a great place to eat\nout in a large group. The menu is a selection of\nmeats and vegetables. You choose which ones\nyou fancy, add some herbs, spices and sauces\nand the chefs stir fry it all in front of your eyes.\nFor \u00a310, you can choose as many different\ncombinations as you can eat. Good fun and they\ndon't mind a little rowdiness.\n20. The Sandwich Shop\nThe Sandwich Shop is probably one of the most\nuseful places around College, especially after\n4pm! They offer a wide selection of pre-packed\nand fresh sandwiches, along with a selection of\nhot foods such as spring rolls, quiches and\npizzas. They also sell good portions of chips The\nbonus is that after 4pm all the s arnie s are half\nprice, bringing them down to around 60p each.\nThey are, of course, not as good as the Union for\nlunches but do do a sterling service. (Best\nbargain in South Ken: huge jam doughnuts for\nonly 30p.) "

Not long into the game the\nteam began to get together rather well, despite\nthe number of players who had never played\nbefore. It was a well fought first half with most\nof the battling being done by Karen and Juliette\nin the central midfield. A courageous run by\nChris from the other side of the pitch to receive\nCaroline's throw in, resulted in a clear run into\nthe box and a goal ten minutes before half-time.\nShortly after the start of the second half, the\nscore almost became 1-1 but for excellent\ndefending on behalf of the goal post. We\nincreased our lead to 2-0 twenty minutes into\nthe half when a scramble in front of the net\nallowed Juliette to take a shot which rebounded\nfor Paula to tap into the goal. Despite RHBNC\npulling back a goal, we restored our two goal\nlead via Juliette's cracking shot off another\ncorner. Some excellent defending allowed us to\nkeep our lead until about ten minutes before\ntime when RH B NC exploited a break to bring\nthe final score to 3-2.\nEveryone out there had a superb game. Well\ndone! Anyone else who is interested in playing\nLadies Football should contact Christine\nDeWolf via the Union Office pigeonholes.\nIC Virgins Tried To Score\nLast Sunday saw the first Ladies Rugby match\nof the season, a friendly against the Royal\nVeterinary College. Despite a bout of flu doing\nthe rounds amongst some of our more seasoned\nplayers, we still managed to field a full team,\neven if half of us had only laid hands on a rugby\nball two weeks ago.\nWith high hopes and loud singing voices we\nroared off to Potters Bar to show the vets what\nIC girls are made of. Unfortunately, we didn't play as well as we sang and by half time the\nscore was 20-0 to them.\nA quick half time pep talk by our coach,\nAdam Cheney, revealed that most of our new\nplayers hadn't been taught how to tackle and a quick explanation followed.\nThe second half went a lot better. We even\ncame close to scoring a couple of times!\nHowever, all we managed was to let another try\nslip by to bring the final score up to 25-0.\nThe score belied what was actually quite a close game with us winning most of the scrum s and line-outs but losing out due to lack of\nexperience. Unabashed, we left the field with\nteam and bodies intact and headed off to the bar\nwhere we soundly thrashed them in an eight man\nboat race.\nThe IC Virgins (as we are more commonly\nknown) train regular y( we need to). Most of us\nare beginners so we won't turn anyone away and\nwe'll welcome anyone with previous experience\nwith open arms. We have been entered in both\nthe Women's Rugby Football Union League and\nthe Universities Athletics Union Ladies Rugby\nLeague so we've got loads of matches, mainly\non Sundays. We'd like to be able to field full\nteams with reserves for them so why not come\nand join us.\nOn Tuesday we train at 5pm. Meet in Beit Quad\nor in Hyde Park.\nOn Thursday evening there is a video training\nsession for rules practice.\nOn Sunday there is either a match or training,\nmeet in Hyde Park at midday.\nOur noticeboard is situated between Da Vinci's and the Union Bar.\nOriental J f len u TUESDAY2 nd NOVEMBER MAIN DINING\nHALL11.452.00 SHERFIELD\n\n"

This is the first Tuesday morning outing\nof the new term at Imperial College. Around\nsixty rowers will be steadily propelling their\nracing craft eight or ten miles in the half-light\nbefore returning to the warmth of the changing\nrooms for a quick shower and a dash to make\nfirst lecture.

For less experienced\nrowers, six times a week is the norm.\nChief architect of this concerted effort is Bill\nMason, the head coach of Imperial College Boat\nClub (ICBC) and guru to his followers. This\nkind of hard grind is needed to be the best at the\ntop level - you have to be very well organised in\nyour work. By necessity your social life tends to\nrevolve around the Club and the rowing circuit,\nas opposed to the more regularly promoted\nLondon scene. The rowing tradition at Imperial\nis very strong, and the College has benefited\nfrom this over the years.\nHowever, many people at Imperial College\nmay not have been interested in the Club's activities; until now you may have been unaware\nThis kind of hard grind\nis needed to be the best\nat the top level\nof the amount of hard work that goes into our\nwell publicised success. Perhaps, after reading\nthis, you might want to go and see what the fuss\nis about and find out why the Boat Club is a little different from the many other societies on\noffer at Imperial. Anyone is welcome to have a go - you provide the enthusiasm, we provide the\nexpertise. It's not all cold morning training\nsessions and blisters - try to picture the thrill of\naccelerating past a crew rowing to their limits, to\nthe accompaniment of the thundering roar of\nthousands of spectators.\nICBC can long claim to be the best student\nboat club in Britain - some recent results provide\nproof. U AU champions five years out of the last\nsix; three Eights' wins at Henley Royal Regatta\nin three years, two of which were in record time;\nnumerous Elite wins and divisional wins at\nHeads and Regattas around the country,\nseventeen international caps in the last two\nseasons, including Under-23 Gold and Silver\nMedals at World level; crews at the World\nStudent Games and representatives at the Senior\nWorld Championships.\nOur first eight maintained its position in the\ntop seven crews at the Eights Head. They have\nbeaten Oxford University and raced in Tokyo,\nCopenhagen and Amsterdam. Meanwhile, the\nwomen's squad, coached by Nick Wilde, has\nmade great advances to become one of the\ncountry's most powerful student crews. As\nschoolboy internationals and Junior National\nChampions join the top squad ranks, the Club\nThe Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton is rev i wed on page\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 9\nDemolition\nMan\nStarring: Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes\nDirector: Marco Brambilla\nThe story begins in LA, 1996. Simon Phoenix,\nplayed by Wesley Snipes, (with his hair dyed)\nhas taken over a section of LA where he is\nholding some twenty people hostage. In order to\ncombat Snipes, John Sparton (Stallone) manages\nto demolish the building in which the hostages\nare held and is subsequently convicted for the\nmurders. As punishment, both Snipes and\nStallone are frozen.\nThe story restarts in a Californian Utopia\nwhere there is no violence or any real crime\nbarring the use of abusive language. Snipes is\ndefrosted to appear before the parole board and\nmanages to escape and get down to killing as\nmany people as he entertains. In order to\nrecapture him, Stallone is defrosted and the\nscene is set for the violence which ensues.\nThe plot is really a vehicle for the violence.\nStallone's character, when not hitting people,\nmust get to grips with the change in society.\nThis is approached as a means to ridicule society\nand results in some great one-liners.\nSnipes' character, like that of Stallone's, is\nfairly two dimensional, but at the end of the day\nthis makes little difference.\nDemolition Man is very much a violent film\nand doesn't pretend to be anything else, making\nit a very enjoyable, if somewhat mindless film.\nIsmail\nManhattan Murder Mystery Dirty Weekend\nStarring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Alan\nAlda, Angelica Hueston.\nDirector: Woody Allen\nFans of the \"early funny ones\" will welcome\nthis. Woody Allen returns once more to the form\nthat made him famous, sharp scripts, one liners,\na slapstick approach, and last (but not least)\nDiane Keaton. If your favourite Woody Allen\nfilms are The Sleeper or Bananas then you'll\nreally enjoy this.\nAllen and Keaton play a middle aged New\nYork couple (surprise, surprise). He is a publisher and she wants to open a fashionable\nNew York restaurant. Alan Alda stars as their\nsingle friend and the attraction between him and\nKeaton leads to the usual Allan-esque scenario\nof life, love and infidelity. However, just as you\nthink you are in familiar territory, the plot\nsuddenly takes off.\nKeaton's' suspicions are aroused by a neighbour who seems less than sad about his\nwife's sudden death. Obsessively following this,\nshe unravels a true murder mystery with many\ntwists and turns. The story is, at times, farcical,\nbut Allen develops a real tension. It's not so\nmuch a piss-take, rather a homage to all those\nold film-noirs of the 40s and 50s. The three main characters are refusing to\nquietly drift into old age. The Keaton and Alda\ncharacters grip to this mystery like a vice, much\nto the dismay of Allen. However, when the plot\nthickens, he joins in just like the others.\nThe rapport between Allen and Keaton is as\nwitty as in the days of The Sleeper. It's a welcome relief to see the back of Mia Farrow\nfrom old Woody's life if this is the result.\nKamran Malik\nStarring: Lia Williams, David McCallum\nDirector: Michael Winner\nMichael Winner has a bit of a reputation.\nMostly, he is described as the director of the\ncontroversial 'Death Wish' series, but he is\nworthy of a bit more respect. His latest offering,\nadapted from the successful novel by Helen\nZahavi, deals with a similarly contentious issue.\nBella (Lia Williams) is a woman with a problem. Having recently moved to Brighton\nfrom London, she is being spied on by a neighbour who phones her to share his\npornographic thoughts. At first she is distraught,\nbut a meeting with a Persian mystic (Ian\nRichardson) convinces her that she must take\naction.\nSo, in true Charles Bronson style, Bella\nmurders her neighbour with a hammer. She is\ninvigorated by her new power. She really takes\nrevenge, buying a gun and killing any poor\npervert who crosses her path in a variety of\ngruesome fashions.\nDirty Weekend is a difficult and very\nchallenging film, flaunting its radical feminist\nagenda of female empowerment as if it were a bus pass. Yet is is immensely difficult to dislike\nthe sheer balls of Winner to tackle such\ncontentious material head-on. He doesn't flinch\nor falter for a second and this alone makes it\nwell worth a look.\nTony\nNext week - an interview with Irish comedian Jimeoin\n\n"

Gabrielle's album is set to\nget pushed straight up into the charts as she\nenters the big time world of promotion and\nhype. Armani recently invited her to the Milan\nFashion Show as his guest and she was one of\nthe star presenters at the British Fashion Awards\netc, etc.\nBack to the business... On a \"worth buying\nscale of 0 to 1\" it gets a1. The album starts off\nnice and then progresses to a deeper and more\nemotional sound. It works as an album, not just\na collection of songs which enables it to sound\nbetter each time you listen to it. (8)\nWish\nReleased on GoBeat\nYo La Tengo\nPainless\nAnother band you've never heard of. Another\nopportunity for me to convince that this is worth\nthe skin off your back. I was once like you, until\nI heard the opening 'Big Day Coming' - a song\nwhich drops your heartbeat to a hypnotised low\nwith underplayed use of whispering vocals and\nlacy distortion. Continuing throughout,\n'Painless' is as close to perfect sublimity as I 've\nmet. Whatever the speed, harshness or surface\nfinish, it has a tightening grasp on your delicate\nsoul. Shake your knees, rattle your skinflint e drag gy skull. It's more than un focused ambience\nand less than spiteful indie mindlessness; it's happy, haunting, ominous and ultimate. So I'm giving this a mark to be un repeated this term, by\ndecree. (10)\nTintin\nReleased on City Slang\nTerrorvision\nNew Policy One\nAin't it infuriating when you can hear a piece of\nmusic which sounds familiar but you can't quite\nremember where it was nicked from? Whatever\nthis originally was, it's here turned into a good\njan gly post-Nirvana pop song, slightly punk y in\nplaces, too. Good, but not substantial.\nFreddy Cheeseworth\nReleased on Total Vegas\nMy Life Story\nGirl A, Girl B, Boy C Facts you should know about My Life Story:\n1) They feature Jake Shillingford, a true star, a cocky genius.\n2) Never before have string instruments been\nput to such good use.\n3) 'Girl A, Girl B, Boy C is a gorgeous sliding\npop song that Paul Weller or Roy Davies\nwould have killed for at their peaks.\n4) The B sides are all rubbish and sound like\nABC, so tape the song off the radio.\nGuy\ni if iiii ill l fil t ll lli if iiii iHi Gigolo Aunts\nFlippin' Out\nThe Boston Tea Party are learning our game.\nWho'd have thought that a Sid Barrett song\nwould inspire anyone, especially to choose a name so peculiar, and yet on contemplation it\nbecomes pretty sens ical in a way.\nThe Aunts play in the current wave of\nAmerican exports who have broken the British\nmarket. Likeish Buffalo Tom, Grant Lee\nBuffalo and Madder Rose, this is stuff which\ntakes the guitar and uses it in a way that makes\nmost British indie bands seem positively acne\nridden. Maybe it's to do with the broad musical\nschool over the duck pond. 'Where I Find My Heaven' rushes around upcountry with a ten\ngallon in tow. The present single 'Bloom' stands\ntall for itself and breaks out into a wall of\nblazing guitar. That the American dream is\nhorribly awry is encompassed on tracks like\n'Gun' and 'Pin Cushion'. Still, the rollercoaster\nhas some way to go before the gut wrenching\npoint that will take them over the top. (7)\nTintin\nReleased on Fire Records\nThe Other Two\nSelfish\nThis band have great credentials. They are, I am\ntold, the half of New Order that no-one has\nheard of and this is their second release.\n'Selfish' itself follows in the style of a typical\nNew Order song with a chorus which repeats\nitself again and again, until it sticks in your head\nannoyingly.\nHowever, it differs from the quartet's dance\nmusic in being much more relaxed. No mean\nPeter Hook bass-lines to be found here. The last\ntrack is much better than the first three, although\nit might send you to sleep. It's a soft and subtle\ntune that builds, rises and then falls away into\nthe distance.\nTimsi\nReleased on London\nTrans-Global\nUnderground\nDream of 100 Nations\nThis double album, originally recorded whilst\nthe band was signed to BMG/Deconstruction\nfeatures a wealth of material, from the debut\nsingle 'Temple Head' to a selection of new\ntracks recorded since the band returned to\nNation Records.\nThe album includes titles such as 'Sirius B' featuring Goldfinger and Lallaman from\nstable mates Fun-Da-Mental plus the great\nNusrat Fateli Ali Khan on a track entitled 'Tutto\nGrande Discordid'. A myriad of influences, a diverse selection of sounds and rhythms.\nTrans-Global Underground produce the kind\nof music you have to be in the right mood for\njust to survive the oppressive ness of the tunes.\nMost sound better if you notch up the pitch\ncontrol a bit. (6)\nWish\nReleased on Nation Records\nAnthrax\ncompetition\nAnd one of the gorgeous winners is\nJonathan Robson from Civ Eng II. Please\ncome into the Felix Office to claim your\nbounty.

For a small charge, you can have a pint and a packet\nof nibbles delivered to someone (or yourself)\nduring a lecture, lab, tutorial... Handcuff-OGrams involve handcuffing two victims together\nuntil they cough up enough money to get the\nkeys. Do you hate someone enough to handcuff\nthem to that boring person in the corner?

    "content": "Features 15\nFancy Spending The Summer In Delaware?\nThis summer, I was one of the five fortunate\nstudents to have a place on the Delaware\nExchange Scheme between Imperial College and\nthe University of Delaware, USA. We were each\ngiven a salary of $2,500 and we had to assist a research professor with his work for ten weeks.\nDelaware is one of the smallest states on the\neast coast of America and has to put up with the\nlong standing 'Dela...w/ie re?' joke. However, to\nits advantage, it has the best crab in the world, is\nwithin day-trip distance of Baltimore, New\nYork, Philadelphia and Washington DC.\nWe arrived in Delaware at lam in the last\nweek of June, to be greeted by a number of\nwide-awake American students. We were\nimmediately invited to a Stallone video-watching 'festival'.\nThe accommodation consisted of a two\nbedroom apartment, a fitted kitchen, air\nconditioning (a must), telephone etc. Whilst we\ndid have room-mates, the nice American I was\nsharing with got fed up with my snoring after a couple of weeks and stayed with his girlfriend\nfor the rest of the time.\nWe first experienced American culture at\nlunch the next day. It was impossible to get\naway from the \" My name is X, if you need\nanything else please don't hesitate to ask\". After\na while, we graded the tip on how little they said\n- the less they said, the larger it was.\nThe work was uninteresting, without being\nboring. Thankfully, Imperial College has a good\nreputation, especially in Electrical Engineering,\nso they didn't treat me like some brainless\nAmerican undergraduate.\nThe other four Imperial College students\nconsisted of two physicists, a chemist and a medical student. They were all 1st class honours\npeople, while I was a lowly 2:2, but one of the\nother students made up for my lack of\nintelligence with his lack of common sense. At\none point he went wandering around New\nOrleans late at night. He survived... just!\nTrips were organised by the University staff\nto New York, Philadelphia for the 4th of July\nThe Washington Monument\nfestivities, Baltimore for the aquarium and\nWashington DC to see 'Bill's pad'.\nOverall it was good fun. If you want to find\nout what research is like in a foreign country,\nthis is the scheme for you. If you just want a good time in the States, the same applies. While\nit doesn't seem very much, the salary lasts long\nenough if you don't buy fifty CDs like I did.\nMore information can be obtained from\nRoom 313C in the Mech. Eng. building. There is\na meeting at 1.15pm on Wednesday 3rd November in Room 342 in the Mech. Eng.\nbuilding about the Delaware Exchange Scheme.\nThe last date for applications is Friday 12th November.\nJoshua Burrill\nHelp The Accommodation Office Help You\nFinding accommodation outside the College\nresidence system is one of the biggest problems\nfaced by students. The condition of the flats is\nmore often than not disgusting and negotiating\nrents etc with the landlord can be fraught with\ndifficulties. However help is at hand...\nImperial College Union is currently setting\nup an Accommodation Bureau in conjunction\nwith the Accommodation Office but, in the\nmeantime, there are several people you can turn\nto within the College who will advise you:\nPat Harvey works in the Accommodation\nOffice, 15 Princes Gardens. She can provide lists\nof 'local' property for rent and also has a booklet\ncontaining useful information about renting\nproperty.\nMinever Kavlak, the Union Adviser, is\navailable every day in the Union Office and she\nis able to give legal advice about your rights as\ntenants.\nYou can also come and talk to either Dave\nGoddard, Deputy President (Finance & Services)\nin the Union Office or myself, Nicky Fox, on ext\n6764.\nThe only way this service can function\neffectively is if you are prepared to help us to\nhelp you. It is important to tell Pat Harvey if any\nflats you view are in bad condition or if you\nhave problems with the landlord. She can then\nadvise other students in how to avoid the\ndifficulties you experienced. It is also helpful if\nyou Can inform her when you accept a property\nso that she can update the lists - there is nothing\nworse than wasting your time and effort phoning\nup for flats that were let three months ago!\nPat has a questionnaire which she would like\nas many students as possible to fill in about\nliving outside College accommodation - this will\nhelp her to advise you better. The questionnaires\nare available from the Accommodation Office.\nFinally, it is most important that you do not\nsign anything that you do not understand. If you\nare unclear about any of the points in a contract,\nmake sure that it is checked by either Pat Harvey\nor the Union Adviser because, once you have\nsigned, it is almost impossible to help you\nshould you run into difficulties. Above all, do\nnot suffer in silence - tell any of us about your\naccommodation problems and we will do our\nbest to help you sort them out.\nIf you have any ideas or advice to offer about\nthe Accommodation Bureau please contact\neither myself or Dave Goddard through the\nUnion Office - we both have internal telephones\nand pigeonholes that you can use.\nNicky Fox\nICU Welfare and Acting Housing Officer.\nSee pages 10 and 11 for the best places to eat in the local area\n\n"

But you should\nhave no difficulties with this one.\nGerald Rose, in his simple yet expressive\nprose, depicts the struggle of an individual,\nMouse, in her fight to overcome her archenemies Dog and Cat. A frail mouse, struggling\nagainst all odds, attempts to overcome their\ntyrannical oppression. But how can she fight\nsuch powerful enemies? By training hard as\nmice do. And yet even after her strenuous\ntraining, she still remains too small to take Cat\nand Dog on, but her very weakness and small\nsize is her salvation. What else could Mouse\nconclude but: \"I am glad they are both so big...\nand I am very very small.\"?\nBeautifully, although sometimes a bit\nfrighteningly, illustrated, Gerald Rose's children\nbooks must be a pleasure for very young\nchildren, but they do raise an issue: Is it\nreasonable to expect people to pay \u00a37.50 for 156\n111 PL J f \u2022\n. , ' Is if S s Sex Tips For\nBoys\nby Kim Scapa\nThis book can be summarised by a few choice\nphrases. \"How to chat up a woman and end up\nin bed\" is one. However, one such as \"The\nSharks' Handbook\" would maybe suit it better.\nWhy, I hear you ask, should any male at IC\nbe interested in such a book?!\nAll kinds of tips are included, from how to\nask a girl out (in a nightclub or even a super-market) to how to fart on a date without being\nnoticed. It also contains chapters headed\nErections and Love In Planes, which deals with\nthe everyday problem of how to make love in a lavatory while cruising at 30,000 feet.\nBecause its written in such a serious manner,\nwhen reading it I'm not sure whether to laugh,\ncry at the thought that some men could take this\nbook seriously, or be violently sick.\nThe main difference bet wen this book and its\npartner 'Sex Tips For Girls', is that this book is\naimed at the subject of 'how to get your girl'\nwhereas the other is more 'how to keep your\nman'. In both cases, the books are very sad. But\nthen if you are desperate...\nJD\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a33.99\nwords? 4.8pa word!. At that price this review\nwould cost you a mere \u00a39.50. Still I only offer\none picture.\nOliver Cow.\nPublished by: Macmillan\nPrice: \u00a37.50\nP^l ll ll Sex Tips For\nGirls\nby Cynthia Heimel\nIf you're looking for the answers to \"all what\nyou've always wanted to know about sex\nwithout daring to ask\", you're not going to find\nthem in this book.\nThis is because, despite its title, there isn't that much about sex itself; the topics are more\nabout what is related to sex. These include how\nto flirt sucessfully, how to diet, how to dress to\nfeel good, do's and don't's of lingerie and the\nbook also warns of the perils of obsession.\nIf you actually need some of the 'advice'\ngiven in here and don't know it already, then\nyou've got a problem. In which case you're\nbetter off not reading the book altogether,\notherwise you might actually take everything\nword for word, which would be even worse.\nTaken seriously, this book is very sad. On\nthe other hand, for most of the book, the author\nis sarcastic and just seems to be taking the piss.\n(I hope so anyway.) Even if the topics\nthemselves can be serious. This can make it fun\nto read; otherwise just forget it.\nJD\nPubished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a33.99\nThe Andromeda\nStrain\nby Michael Crichton\nNow, I'm not a scientist, so I assumed this 1969\neffort from the ubiquitous author of 'Jurassic\nPark' and 'Rising Sun' would be really boring\nand, well, sad basically. Imagine my surprise\nwhen it turned out to be the most rollicking\ngood read since 'Sex Tips For Boys'.\nThe plot has aged well. A probe sent into the\nupper atmosphere to detect new bacterial strains\ncrashes in a small Arizona town, killing\neveryone except an old man and a baby. Five\ntop nerds (oh, sorry, scientists) have to do lots\nof experiments to try to save life as we know it.\nI find it remarkable and admirable that\nCrichton manages to make a taut and assured\nthriller out of this nonsense. In the hands of\nsomeone less gifted it could have sounded\ndangerously like a GCSE lesson with one of\nthose really uninspired Biology teachers. He\nalso makes sure the science doesn't get in the\nway of the tension.\nVery highly recommended.\nTony\nPublished by: Arrow\nPrice: \u00a34.99\nWififffllSM\n\u2022:\u2022\u2022. . . \u2022 ... \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nDirk Gently\nCompendium\nby Douglas Adams\nConsisting of both Dirk Gently's Holistic\nDetective Agency and The Long Dark Tea-Time\nof the Soul and brought out in the current 'Two\nbestsellers for the price of one' series by Pan,\nthis is a buy not to be missed if your bookcase\ndoesn't include either already.\nReleased as a refreshing change of direction\nwhen the Hitch-Hiker's trilogy began to\nstruggle, they consist of the exploits of the\nirrepressible Svlad ' Dirk' Gently whose\nmethods of solving mysteries involve\ntechniques ranging from the sublime to the\ndownright inspirational.\nThe humour in true Adams style is\nin surpass able with much of the text being\nquote able to great extents.

The following day,\nSunday 7th November, the College is hosting\nthe official U AU sponsored National Student\nICBC can long claim to\nbe the best student\nboat club in Britain\nIndoor Rowing Championships in the Great\nHall. This will be used as a valuable fitness\nassessment as well as being an official U AU event. Schools, universities and colleges from all\nover the country will be attending, vying for the\nWalkman prizes in various categories.\nWe would like to encourage non-rowers to\ntry their hand, perhaps at the team event for four\npeople. The RSM, RCS, C&G, rugby, hockey,\nfootball or any other club can put a team\ntogether on the day and compete for the prizes of\na barrel of beer - which is a good enough\nincentive for anyone! Or if you are around\nCollege on Sunday, come along and give some\nsupport to your friends, to the College or just\ncome along to have some fun.\nLooking further ahead in the season, we are\naiming to supersede our own record of divisional\nwins at the Eights' Head in March and hopefully\ngo on to dominate the domestic racing season,\nculminating in Henley Regattas for both men\nand women. The Club is also hoping to take a small number of athletes to a training camp in\nItaly at Easter, providing the students can find\nthe money or possibly with sponsorship. There\nhas already been an offer of a training camp and\nUniversities Race in Banyoles, Spain this month\nbut unfortunately, the finances of the students\nprevented us from attending. This is often a problem as rowers have to pay for most of their\ntrips and races, even with generous support from\nSatelcom UK, based at Silwood Park.\nAnother problem this year, which may\nbecome a major obstacle, is that there are around\nforty top squad oarsmen, twenty intermediates,\ntwenty senior women and seventy novices in the\nClub and our Putney boat house has to provide\nboats, racking space, changing rooms and\nshowers for all of them. We are absolutely\njam-packed and in addition the Club has also\nhad to create a makeshift gymnasium as our\nprevious arrangements with St. Paul's School\nhave become too expensive. The Club needs\nmore facilities in the shape of a proper gym,\nmore space for our \u00a3200,000 worth of boats and\na workshop so that repairs and normal\nmaintenance of boats can be carried out. For a club which offers so much to students, achieves\nacclaim in the national press and is obviously a tremendous advert for the College, surely this is\nreasonable?\nWe don't want to become a victim of our\nown success as more and more people want to\nexperience the challenge of rowing. Most of the\nWe don *t want to\nbecome a victim of our\nown success\ntime we make room for everyone but that room\nis in short supply.

We do a lot together, but there's also the\nfeeling that we share something very important down at the Club.\nHow hard is it to combine the two?\nWell it's not hard at all, in that you just decide to do something and\nyou do it, if you really want to. You don't have to worry about how\nmany hours you spend training or whatever - you just do it!\nWhatplans do you have for the future? In the long term I don't feel that IC will be the end of my rowing\ncareer. I don't want to limit myself but at the same time I don't want\nthe pressure of thinking about getting an Olympic medal if I'm not\ngood enough. I think it will be a big year for IC and you have to\nthink Henley - we've always been successful there and I think we\nwill be again.

Looking down the list, there's the\nMines' Dirty Disco on Monday 8th November.\nIf I remember correctly, lots of people were\ngoing around with not a lot on. It is all in the\nname of charity, of course.\nSome of you may have seen the copy of the\nSun newspaper in which two girl reporters went\nundercover to one of King's College's parties.\nThe front page headline read 'Girls were naked\nand boys were naked'. It went on to say in the\narticle that it was an ordinary Monday night in\nthe College and Britain's future doctors and\nother to professionals were 'having fun'.\nI wonder what they would make of the Dirty\nDisco? An ordinary Monday night in Imperial\nCollege, and no doubt boys will be naked and\ngirls will be naked!\nIt seems to me that the Sun have gone a bit\nover the top. Sending two girls to spy on load of\nstudents in one of the first weeks of term. I'm not surprised things were a bit wild. First years\nare away from home for probably the first time\nand other people are meeting up with old friends\nafter the long summer break. A reason for a party, don't you think?\nAnyway, what is wrong with students having\nfun. Some may choose to get riotous ly drunk\nand strip off in front of everyone, others may\nchoose to spend the evening in front of the TV.\nEach to their own. Not everyone at College is\nhell-bent on getting plastered every night.\nAdmittedly, quite a few do. But as John McCall\nsaid in the news story on page three, people can\nhave a great time without touching a drop. You\njust have to know your limits.\nGoing back briefly to Rag Week, it's all great\nfun. With something going on every day for\nalmost two weeks, you've got no excuse not to\ngo to at least one event. If you make it out of\nbed in the morning of Saturday 13th November,\nthen you could watch the Sponsored Nude\nKamikaze Parachute Jump, another excuse for\npeople to get their kit off.\nThere are plenty of other events that don't involve nudity or drinking, so the choice is\nyours - there's something for everyone.\nBlatant Advertising Ploy\nBeccy,\nMay I draw your readers' attention to\nImperial's newest leisure facility, the ICU Cinema. We've been open for business on the\n2nd Floor of the Union Building since the start\nof term, and there are currently screenings on\nthree to four nights per week. The programme\nconsists of a mixture of Hollywood blockbusters,\nclassics, and narrow distribution films;\nNovember's programme (to be found in this\nissue) is mainly top Hollywood movies but we\nhope to increase the number of Arthouse and\nforeign films shortly.\nNow that we screen only industry standard\n35mm film, the quality of presentation is equal\nto or better than most local cinemas, with the\nadded bonus that we welcome any drinks or food\nfrom Da Vinci' s in the cinema. Not many\ncinemas or theatres allow you to enjoy a pint\n(short, wine, cheeseburger etc) with the film!\nI 'll admit that the Odeon Leicester Square has\na better sound system than us, but we have plans\nto rectify this soon, pending admissions!\nHowever, our 9.8m wide legendary CinemaScope screen is 'More of an Experience'!\nThis is bigger than the CinemaScope screens\nat ALL three local cinemas and is only bettered\nby a few premier screens in the West End. The\nnext film in CinemaScope is Reservoir Dogs this\nSunday at 8pm.

    "content": "Clubs and Societies 19\nConstitutional Changes And Their Effect On\nThe Clubs And Societies\nMany of you will probably be unaware of the\nconstitutional change that was approved at the\nUnion General Meeting on Friday 22nd October.\nIt created a new management body of the Union\nthat contains just twelve people on something\ncalled the Executive Committee rather than the\nold 55 member Council. Clubs and societies are\nnow represented by just one person, Charles\nLeary, the Deputy President (Clubs & Societies).\nThe new streamlined management body\nrepresents every aspect of the Union once rather\nthan the old system where too many people\nduplicated each other's areas of responsibility. It\nalso puts in place a far more professional system\nto have all views represented with the minimum\nof people involved. Many would worry about\npersonal bias affecting important decisions.\nThere must be trust in the fact that any view will\nbe aired and anyone can raise a motion. Then the\nelected officers will make a decision based on\nthe case that is presented.\nIn order that the views of clubs and societies\nare aired properly, a new group must be created.\nThis group will consist of the Major and Minor\nSub-Committee Chairmen and the Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies). This is the forum\nwhere problems directly concerning clubs will\nbe dealt with. For the system to work properly it\nis important for society Chairs to know where to\ndirect their problems. Most issues can be\nresolved at the major sub-committee level, and it\nkeeps the MSC Chairs informed of what is\nhappening. Major problems can then be referred\non if necessary.\nCurrently, most clubs are coming straight to\nthe Deputy President without informing their\nmajor sub-committee chairs first. This is causing\nsome breakdown in communications and queues\nare forming in the Union Office to see the\nDeputy President.\nIn order to solve this problem, societies must\nuse their major sub-committees more than they\nare currently doing. The whole system works on\ncommunication at many levels. The constitution\nis new and therefore we must change the way we\noperate in order to use it to its maximum\npotential. Clubs and societies comprise a major\npart of both the expenditure and administration\nof the Union. The success of both the new\nconstitution and the new post of Deputy\nPresident (Clubs & Societies) rests with the\nexecutive of each club and society.\nC& GU Motor Club Hunt For Treasure\nOn Sunday 24th October, City and Guilds\nCollege Motor Club held their Annual Treasure\nHunt. The aim of this event is to cram as many\nstudents as you can into a car and try to solve as\nmany clues and collect as much 'treasure' as\npossible. 'Treasure' basically means anything\nthat isn't nailed down, but you get bonus marks\nfor items such as police producer forms! The day\ngot off to a good start when the organisers\nturned up half an hour late, but after a short wait\n(for some competitors to arrive), the event got\nunderway only an hour behind schedule.\nEverything was going fairly well until we\nremembered that the clocks had just gone\nforward an hour, and so we ran out of daylight\nearlier than we thought we would! Faced with\nthe task of solving the clues in the dark, most\ncrews promptly went to the finish, which handily\nenough happened to be a pub, and drowned their\nsorrows. The results were duly announced, with\nthe conquering Cave family yet again winning\nan event, and last place going to the Captain's team, who decided that going to a kebab house\nwas much more important than getting to the\nfinish in time!\nForthcoming Motor Club Events include:\nFreshers' Rally - Friday 29th October\nRallies are held on Friday night/Saturday\nmorning and involve first solving clues which\ndefine a route down some particularly twisty\ncountry lanes, then thrashing along it as quickly\nas you can manage in order to reach the end in a set time. These events are run at an average of\n30mph, but this includes the time you have to\nsolve the navigation clues, so although you don't need an Escort Cosworth to be competitive,\nsome enthusiastic driving is essential! These\nevents call for a fair degree of teamwork\nbetween driver and navigator and are great fun\nfor all concerned.\nSkid Control Trip - Sunday 31st October\nThe Skid Control trips are under professional\ninstruction at Goodwood Motor Circuit. The\ncourse comes in two parts, an introductory and\nan advanced part. You are taught how to deal\nwith a variety of skid situations and introduced\nto techniques such as cadence braking, which is\nthe human version of ABS (anti-lock braking\nsystem). All cars are supplied by the skid pan, so\nall you need to do is come along and enjoy\nyourself!\nBrighton Trip - Sunday 7th November\nOn this trip we accompany our veteran car, Bo,\nto Brighton on the RAC Classic Car Run. Well\nwe don't really accompany it, we just wave it off\nfrom Hyde Park then get a coach down to\nBrighton. When we get there we drink a lot,\nwatch Bo arrive, have a nice meal and then drink\na bit more. Oh, and finish the day off with a go\non the dodge ms( since we are a motor club and\nneed to drive at least once on an event!). The\nevent is basically a fun day out and has an\natmosphere all of it's own - approximately one\npart air to two parts alcohol.\nTo find out more about City and Guilds Motor\nClub events, all you have to do is come to the\nCity and Guilds Union Office, level 3,\nMechanical Engineering, any lunchtime and ask\nto speak to a member of the Motor Club or look\nat our noticeboard (level 3, Mechanical\nEngineering).\nA review of Manhattan Murder Mystery is on page 9\n\n"

Excess alcohol\nconsumption blamed\nYoung Drinkers Are Warned To\nTake It Easy'\nBY SHAUN JOYNSON\nCalls are being made for fresher s at\nImperial to control their drinking\nfollowing a horrific accident in\nwhich a young student was nearly\nkilled.\nOlder students made the plea\nfollowing an accident last Friday\nnight which involved a first year\nmale student.\nThe student had been drinking\nthroughout the evening and had to\nbe carried back to his lodgings.\nDespite friends checking on him\nregularly throughout the night, he\nplunged from a third floor window\nonto the street. He was rushed to\nhospital and was found to have\nbroken both legs and all of his ribs.\nPolice who investigated the incident\nare not treating it as suspicious, but\nit is believed that alcohol was to\nblame for the fall.\nThe accident has reminded many\nstudents at Imperial College of the\ndangers of 'the demon drink'.\n\"What happens is that among one's friends, everyone's doing it, and\nafter a while, one loses consciousness of how much one has drunk in\nan evening,\" said Kerry Woods, a Maths student.\nDrunkenness among students is\nno worse than in any other section\nof the community, but students,\nparticularly those who may not\nhave been drinkers before coming\nto College, have low resistance to\nthe effects of alcohol. \"And the\ntrouble is,\" commented first year\nGeologist James Gray, \"you always\nthink that it won't happen to you.\"\n\"Drink is fun,\" he added. \"But you\ndon't think of accidents.\"\nKerry Woods believes that peer\npressure and the free availability of\nalcohol at many College events can\ncause problems for some students.\n\"Most can hold their drink, some\nsimply can't,\" she said.\nCautionary advice to young\nstudents also came from, John\nMcCall, President of the Royal\nSchool of Mines Union. He said\nthat peer pressure to drink to excess\nshould be avoided. \" At our own\nUnion dinner on Friday evening a girl drank nothing but Diet Pepsi.\nAnd she had a great time too.\nBasically, my message is know\nyour limits.\"\nBY JOE MCFADDON\nThe police had to be called to\nSouthside Gymnasium last\nSaturday evening, to arrest a student alleged to have smashed a window there.\nMr Grimbalston, a student at\nBristol University, was part of a group from the Prince's Trust, a charitable organisation, sleeping\novernight in the gym. The other\nmembers of the group, who were\nmostly from Blackburn, took no\npart in any violent incident. The\ngroup leader alerted College\nsecurity when the window was\nbroken and the police were brought\nin soon after.\nGrimbalston, who required\nmedical attention for various cuts to\nhis hands and arms, was arrested\nand charged with criminal damage.\nHis trial took place on Monday.\nAndy Wensley, Imperial\nCollege Union President, described\nGrimbalston as a \"prat\", and went\non to say, \"I hope he sorts his life\nout quite soon.\"\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

This event is the biggest non-CAMRA beer\nfestival in the country, and basically involves lots of people consuming\napproximately three tonnes of some of the best beer around in the comfort\nand safety of the JCR, whilst being entertained by a band of Morris\nDancers. Also the Beer Festival marks the launch of this years version of\nImperial College's notorious Rag Mag.\nSlave Auction\nPiles of washing up? Laundry getting on top of you? Lecture notes in need\nof copying? Here's the ideal solution: The Slave Auction is where anyone\nwho is silly enough to take part auctions off 24 hours of their time with the\nproceeds going to charity. Buying a slave for the day could help you get\nyour life sorted out! Imagine having all your meals cooked for you, having\nall those smelly socks washed, that urgent lab report written up all whilst\nyou sit around with your feet up having all your drinks brought to you. In\ncase you wondered, sexual favours are by written consent only. You could\neven club together with a group of friends to buy a slave. If you fancy\nsigning up as a slave yourself pop along to the Guilds office and put your\nname down.\nGuilds' Carnival\nThis excellent event kicks off the first weekend of Rag Week. By now,\neveryone should have recovered from the Beer Festival and will be ready to\nPaaarty! There will be lots of fun to be had with two or three bands,\nincluding the Blues Bunch, playing and inflatables (eg Sumo wrestling)\naround the place. Also there will be a bar extension 'til late for all you\nheavy drinkers out there (and everyone else). Buy your tickets now or miss\nout. They are on sale now from the Guilds' Office (Room 340, Mech Eng\nBuilding).\nHalls Dirty Dozen\nThis is an event for all you Hall Residents out there. The idea is that you\nget together a team of twelve keen people and go to a place of your choice\nand collect for the charity of your choice for twelve hours. Sounds easy,\ndoesn't it?! The team that collected the most money during the day wins an\nabsolutely magnificent prize (usually a barrel of beer). Teams usually dress\nup or do other silly things in order to raise money so take part and have an\nexcellent day.\nBungee Jump\nOn a Sunday, students would normally be lying in bed catching up on sleep\nand doing all the work they hadn't done all week, but not today! About 120\nmad people are going of to Cambridge to jump of a170 foot high crane and\nraise money for W.W.F. whilst they fly through the air! This is some thing\npeople equate to sex or just plain adrenaline, but whatever your viewpoint\non this spectacular event, it should prove to be excellent fun. If you want to\ndo a jump, there might just be enough time for you sign up, but you will\nhave to come and see us very rapidly as places are limited and going fast!\nMines' Dirty Disco\nHere's another of the many opportunities during the week to get your\nclothes off for charity! The Mines' Dirty Disco is, as the name implies, a disco where the theme is the less you wear the less you pay. Therefore, if\nyou turn up in just a sock (if you are a man, that is), strategically placed of\ncourse, then you probably would get in for free or have to pay very little\nindeed. Of course, no clothes means no cost!\nICU Rag Week\nWed 3rd Nov\nThu 4th Nov Fri 5th Nov Sat 6th Nov Sun 7th Nov Mon 8th Nov\nTue 9th Nov Wed 10th Nov\nThu 11th Nov\nFri 12th Nov\nSat 13th Nov\nSun 14th Nov\nR.C.S.

We have to stress that only over\neighteen year olds are admitted and we hold no responsibility for expectant\nmothers or people of a nervous disposition. If you have never seen a hypnotist before then go. If you have, you'll know how good it is and will\nwant to go again! Get there early or buy your tickets in advance is the best\nadvice for this evening as this show always sells out, even though we hold\nit in the biggest room in college. After the hypnosis event, we all move\nover to the Union Building to see a band playing in the Concert Hall and\ndrink the bar extension away!\nRag Bar Evening\nThis is where Raggies, and anyone else who wants to, converges on the\nUnion Bar and has a particularly excellent evening! We will be indulging\nin such silly things as 1001 Down Darts and other such daft bar games.\nWe'll be there for a chat or any information that you may require, so pop in\nand see us - we may even buy you a drink, depending on how generous\nwe're feeling at the time. But you'll be guaranteed a good night's entertainment if nothing else.\nFilm Night\nWell, this is quite explanatory really. Filmsoc have arranged to show a special film premiere just for us, the film being 'Much Ado About\nNothing' which has had some absolutely splendid reviews. So come and\nsee it at the cheapest, largest, most convenient cinema in London - you'll\nregret it if you don't. Rag Bash\nThe last party of Rag Week and nearly the end of that marvellous period,\nbut this doesn't mean that you can miss this event. Tonight, Rag comes to\nthe Union with live live bands (featuring one of our very own sabbaticals!),\nbar extension, disco and a bit of a wild time. So, for only a few pennies,\nyou can round up your Rag Week in style with all your friends and enjoy\nyourself in the craziest way!\nS.N.K. P.J. By now, you might have heard all about the Sponsored Nude Kamikaze\nParachute Jump, but for those of you that haven't, let me inform you. This\nis a little activity where a certain number of people jump out of the back of\na minibus outside Harrods wearing nothing but bow ties and then proceed to\nmake it back to college. This is usually done as rapidly as possible but, for\nthe mad amongst you, there is a prize for the last person back to college!\nLast year we had a female student do the jump for the first time and we\nmight have Paul Thomas going for his hat-trick this year. So, if you fancy\nwatching something silly on a Saturday morning go and watch, or for the\nmore daring of you - take part!\nRag Rugby\nSee over the page for sports news.\nThis year's collecting incentives: \u00a350 - mug, \u00a3150 - T shirt \u00a3300 - long-sleeved T shirt, \u00a31,000 - rugby shirt, \u00a32,000 - tankard\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 7\nmm mm Racing Demon\nWhile exploring the attitudes, problems and\nthreats to the Church Of England, Racing\nDemon obviously has a lot of substance to it,\nmore than David Hare's other two plays. There\nis a lot to chew on as we witness an old vicar\nbeing usurped from his parish by a young naive\npriest with evangelical tendencies. We are\nalmost encouraged to examine and question the\nhierarchy within the Church itself, as well as the\nstate of the Church in general.\nOur eyes are opened to various aspects of the\nChurch that are often ignored such as the vicar's private life, and we are made to feel sad and\npossibly sympathetic towards him and any\nmember of the Church who is hounded down by\nsomeone.\nThis play does not allow your brain to sit idly\nby and let the hysterical and almost blasphemous jokes roll over you. Active thinking is\nrequired and, unless you are theologically\nminded, the going can sometimes be a bit tough.\nPersevere, though, and the effort will pay off.\nA well cast and well acted play that should\nplease most. The best of the trilogy without a doubt.\nHarry\nIn rep at the Olivier Theatre, South Bank, SE1.\n071 928 2252. Tickets \u00a38.50-121. Cones and\nstudent standbys available {check daily press).\nMurmuring\nJudges\nThe weakest of David Hare's trilogy explores\nthe legal system by showing the apparent flaws\nand injustices within it. This is quite cleverly\ndone by telling the story of a sort-of-wrongly\nconvicted Irish blok e and the female black\nlawyer who tries to fight against a dominant\nmale system. The ending is ninety-nine percent\npredictable. Not much is left to the imagination.\nThe whole thing is near enough spoon-fed to\nyou and at least three quarters of the jokes and\narguments have been put forward before, either\nby other plays or by various television\nprogrammes. There really isn't much to this\nmoderately acted play except a bit of male\nnudity and lots of law folk talking about the law.\nIt is like merging a BBC2 documentary and The\nBill with hints of Rumpole Of The Bailey.\nAt the end, you look back and wish that less\nattention was paid to the entertaining visuals\nand more to the content. An opportunity to raise\nnew arguments about the legal system seems to\nhave been wasted and the result is a disappointing play that lets the side down.\nHarry\nIn rep at the Olivier Theatre, South Bank, SE1.\n071 928 2252. Tickets \u00a38.50-\u00a321. Cones and\nstudent standbys available (check daily press).\nSavage in\nLimbo\nSome people are born crap; others attain\ncrap ness my excuse is that crap ness was thrust\nupon me.\nIt was all Ewan's fault of course. \"Quicker to\ndrive,\" he'd said, and so after an impromptu\ntour of Camden's back-streets we arrived late,\nwondering what the hell was going on.\nI soon stopped worrying about what I'd missed and began to enjoy the play. It's set in a sleazy New York bar, frequented by a bunch of\nmisfits, bar flies and no-hope rs. We watch them\ntrying to deal with life in the Bronx, all the\nwhile searching for an escape from their dead-end existence.\nSounds a little heavy? Well yes, the play is\nchallenging, but it's also very funny. John\nPatrick Shanley's script bristles with spike y wit\nand world-weary wisdom (he also wrote the\nscreenplay for Moonstruck). The cast performs\nwell, and the director manages to make a virtue\nof the tiny venue.\nSo if you want an entertaining night out\nwhich will also make you think, see this play.\nJoe\nCamden Studio Theatre. Tel: 071 916 4040.\nCones \u00a34.50. Ends 6th Nov.\nlYI a china l( pronounced Macinaal, meaning mechanical in Frenc\nMachinal, written in 1928, is the most famous\nwork of the American playwright Sophie\nTreadwell. It was written in a period when\nwomen were incarcerated into a society in which\nmale domination was the norm and accepted; a society in which a woman was cos set ed and\nprotected behind closed doors and in which it\nwas generally expected that she should be a devoted wife and mother, be a genius at keeping\nhouse while making herself wonderful evening\nattires out of old curtains.\nThis is the situation in which we meet Helen,\na young woman working as a stenographer. The\nconsiderably older George H. Jones, her\nwheeler-dealer boss, has an eye on Helen and\nmoreover, with every opportunity, his wandering\nhands.\nThe opening scene is brilliant, the staging\nsuperbly executed and simply electrifying as is\nthe last scene, literally. Helen, being aspiring,\nwould have liked to have been loved by a man\nshe found attractive, but at twenty-three with no\nproposal to date, she is also a realist. To her,\nleading a hand-to-mouth existence to support\nherself and her widowed mother for the rest of\nher life is less attractive than accepting the\nproposal from George H. Jones whose fleshy,\n'fat' hands she finds repellent and in whose\npresence her 'blood runs cold'! This is Helen's undoing as was that of many women of her time.\nRight from the honeymoon, where George\nboasts about the cost of their cruise and remarks\nhalf-jokingly that he intends to get his \"money's worth\", to the birth of their daughter where he\ntells the exhausted Helen that she should \"brace\nup\" and be prepared to \"start the uphill climb\",\none suffers with Helen. George is not heartless\nbut is totally incapable of understanding or\nsupporting his wife in her quest to find peace\nand a loving life companion in him. She is led to\nlook elsewhere and finds a lover in whom she\nrejoices and feels free. She begins to dwell on\nhis story of how once, in order to escape from\nsome bandits, he had killed using a bottle filled\nwith pebbles.\nThe story is then predictable. In the court\ncase ensuing against her, Helen is remorseful\nand gives up trying to defend herself. She had\nwanted to be free and to find peace after six\nyears with George H. Jones. This raise questions\non the way in which provocation is dealt with in\nlaw and on a society that is especially shocked\nwhen a woman turns against her husband. She is\nbreaking both the law and the unwritten rule of\nhow she is expected to behave. In English law\naccording to John Mortimer, husbands have\nbeen more easily provoked than their\ncounterparts. In 1988 and 1992 two men were\ngiven suspended sentences for murdering their\nwives on provocation such as 'nagging'.\nConvincing a judge of provocation changes the\ncharge from murder to man-slaughter.\nHelen Jones is sent to the electric chair.\nTreadwell's play is loosely based on the famous\nRuth Snyder trial that took place five years prior\nto her writing the play. Ominously, Helen's world is not all that far from what it is today!\nFiona Shaw (Helen) has handled her physically\ndemanding role superbly and the ambitious\nstaging, making use of a hoisted roof and the\ncompletely mobile stage has worked well. It is\ncertainly one of the most dramatic I 've seen.\nWell worth going to see it.\nRekha Nayak\nLyttleton Theatre, South Bank Centre. Price:\n\u00a38.50-\u00a321.00 For student standbys ring 071 928\n2252for details.\nFilmSoc's future screenings can be found on page 8\n\n"
