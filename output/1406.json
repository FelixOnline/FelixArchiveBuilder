They\u2019ve touched a lot of people with their music.\nApart from yourselves, who do\nyou think people should take\nnotice of in the music business at\nthe moment?\nS: The Wall Birds who are our sup-ports. They are a great folky/rocky\nthree piece. They\u2019ve supported the Pigeons before as well.\nWhat are your opinions on people\nlike Britney and Pete Doherty?\nS: Bit of a waste I suppose. Pete Doherty with all that talent, no need to mess\nit up like that. Britney, she has gone\nmad. She\u2019s gone.\nJ: She\u2019s insane, gone doolali. Pete\u2019s an\namazing talent. It\u2019s a real shame.\nWhat about Amy Winehouse?\nS: She\u2019s got a great voice. She might\nsort herself out. Out of the three peo-ple, she is probably the one most likely\nto sort herself out. I think she is close\nto passing the point where she won\u2019t be\nable to recover, but who knows.\nJ: I do like her. I believe that she is capable of sorting herself out. You can\nhope.\nHave you ever been pressurised\nto take drugs?\nJ: No. You just simply say no.\nDo you get recognised when you\ngo out?\nS: Not overly. Sometimes in smaller\ntowns. I don\u2019t really mind being recog-nised. I wouldn\u2019t want it to go to far.\nBeing stalked, that would be weird.\nJ: George does a bit. It\u2019s when we are at\ngigs, we do.\nDo you ever read your fan-mails?\nS: We don\u2019t really get that much, but\nwe get stuff handed to us at gigs and\nsignings.\nJ: We do read them and eat the\nchocolates/sweets.\nName favourite musicians of all\ntime.\nS: There are a lot of amazing musi-cians. Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones,\nGuns and Roses, The Cure etc\u2026 Modern bands: there\u2019s Arcade Fire and The\nKillers.\nDo you ever have time to watch\nTV nowadays?\nJ: We rarely ever get to a place where\nwe can get a TV signal. It is hard to get\nTV signal when the tour bus is mov-ing. But SkyPlus is a beautiful thing.\nLost is amazing. I used to watch the\nOC. I\u2019ve watched Skins; about 4 shows.\nBig Brother. I\u2019m quite ashamed of liking Big Brother now, but it is good.\nS: I haven\u2019t seen Eastenders for about 2\nmonths. I miss it.\nWould you ever go on Big\nBrother?\nJ: Hell yeah. I would love to go on it.\nS: You\u2019d get messed up in there.\nHave you ever been to any showbiz parties?\nS: We went to the Brits this year, No\ngossip. We met people like Rhianna\nand the Kaiser Chiefs. Nice to meet but\nit\u2019s not really a big deal when you meet\nanother musician.\nJ: We got really, really drunk. All the\nbooze was free. And it\u2019s just danger-ous. Champagne. Anything you want.\nDo you think music videos are important to the package of a band?\nS: Yes, a band with a good video would\ndefinitely go further than a band with a\nrubbish one.\nJ: That treadmill video. People will\nremember that video forever, it is\nlegendary.\nS: But they\u2019ve got the music behind it\nto back it up. It\u2019s not just the video that\nmakes it work.\nIf you could choose any location\nto shoot a video, where would\nyou choose?\nJ: Sam\u2019s house. It\u2019s in a massive valley\nand there\u2019s a huge abbey over the other\nside of the river. It would be epic. If it\nwas all lit up at night, it would look\ninsane.\nS: Nice big river, a big field, national\nheritage.\nHave you ever done anything\ncrazy on stage?\nS: We are all very energetic on stage.\nGeorge like doing big guitar swings.\nJ: I decked myself in front of five thousand people at Brixton Academy. It felt\nweird trying to stand up again. Our\nbass player is the most mental one out\nof all of us.\nWill we be seeing a second album\ncoming out sometime in the\nfuture?\nJ: We are hoping to make one maybe in\na year\u2019s time.\nS: That\u2019s what we are hoping, maybe\nnext summer. What\u2019s going to come\nout will come out. Let\u2019s wait and see.\nThese kick-ass, drum\u2019n\u2019bass Aussies\nwho dabble with rock/electronica,\nhave certainly tasted a lot of success\nsince the release of their debut album-Hold Your Colour back in 2005. Their\nnew album, In Silico, stormed into the\nalbum charts at number two; they are\nsimply on fire, oozing sheer confidence\nfrom all corners. Their soaring music\nhas the inherent power to rip the dance\nfloor apart leaving perennial repercussions wherever and whenever it is\nplayed.\nPendulum knew exactly how to get\nthousands of us up and raving at the\nAcademy. The band were plainly in\ntheir element, high on something for\nsure. They delivered the show with incredible pumping sonic soundscapes,\nthe whole time, each one of the protagonists unmistakably immersed in\nthe zone. Some have likened Pendulum\nto a modern-day Prodigy, the band is\ncomprised of Rob Swire (vocals/synth/\nproducer), two guitarists, a DJ, drummer and an Mc who mixes the beats to\nperfection. A clan of many talents.\nGetting towards midnight, the ravings began, the fireworks were ignited\nwith the onset of a laser show, a frenzy\nofflashingcoloursonstageinitiatedthe\nincredible buzz that pulsated through\nthe crowd as Pendulum took to the\nstage. It was electric, the crowd going\ntotally beserk, a heavy contrast to the\nsomewhat lukewarm responses exhibited towards the previous two DJ sets.\nThe lure of the coquettish rumbling\nbass seemingly galvanized the fans\ninto action, everyone either punching\nthe air with glow sticks, shouting or\nscreaming frantically, before the coolly\ncomposed quintet appeared from a\nmist of dry ice. Pendulum; they know\nhow to play it cool.\nThe band enlightened us with a mixture of both their old and new material.\nOf note, the slinky old number \u2018Fasten\nYour Seatbelt\u2019, the mesmerizing \u2018Hold\nYour Colour\u2019 and the uber-racy \u2018Another Planet\u2019 were huge crowd pleas-ers. \u2018Propane Nightmares\u2019, their last\ntop-ten colossal radio hit explicitly\ndemonstrates Pendulum\u2019s progression\nmusically. Vocalist Swire\u2019s bold intonations cross with orchestral rock,\nbefore crescendoing into their trademark stomping drum\u2019n\u2019bass mayhem.\nWhat more could you possibly want?\n\u2018Mutiny\u2019 offered a punky feisty edge\nwhilst \u2018Blood Sugar\u2019 blew the place to\nshreds with its phenomenal symphonic aggression and energy. The dramatic\nsoundscapes engineered by Pendulum\nwere a stunning combination of gravitational thudding beats along with\nheavy yet suave bass-lines held together by trance-like leads. Irresistible to\nadolescents and grown-ups needing a\nstrong dose of cataclysmic mash-up.\nI have no doubt that this epic quintet\nwill continue to orchestrate cyclones in\nthe festival season ahead, having mastered an unforgettable live presence of\ntheir own.\nSusan Yu\nPendulum: pretty in pink\nGlowing in green\nPaying these guys to smile almost worked\n\n"

I\u2019m so excited I really can\u2019t fall\nasleep. I can\u2019t even lie still. I\u2019m really\ngoing \u2013 alone. I can\u2019t take anyone \u2013 I\ncan\u2019t even tell anyone \u2013 they\u2019d all just\ntry to dissuade me.\n\u2018It\u2019s too dangerous\u2019, \u2018you don\u2019t know\nwhat could be out there\u2019. The same\nfeeble warnings from people I used\nto respect. Can\u2019t they see how mind-numbingly fascinating the unknown\nis? I despise this pathetic routine we\u2019ve\nsettled into. Same boring schedule.\nSame boring people. There must be\nmore to life than the Skempton Building and the Civil Engineering Department. There must be. And I\u2019m going to\nfind it.\nI leave tomorrow. Across the Queen\u2019s\nLawn to the Sherfield Building \u2013 my\nadrenaline is incandescing as I write\nthose magic words. Sherfield Building. Sherfield Building. The very act of\nsetting them down on paper is enough\nto give me a rush unlike any I ever got\nfrom cocaine.\nThe Sherfield Building. The last\nknown bastion of civilization. And\nthen, then! Out into the great un-known. To the banks of the Great Sherfield Walkway; let it carry me where it\nwill. My bags are packed, my equipment is in working order; everything\u2019s\nready. I really must force myself to get\nsome sleep.\nI leave at dawn.\nMarch 13th\n10:15\nLeft at dawn. Was unable to get through\nthe Sherfield gates till a quarter to ten.\nSpent four miserable hours shivering\nin the rain, attempting to find shelter\nunder the forbidding presence of the\nQueen\u2019s Tower. A disappointing start.\nAm currently warming myself in the\nSherfield building, trying to strike\nup conversations with the seasoned\ntravellers around me. One shrivelled\nCaz Knight\nHeld hostage by Facebook\nB\nebo, Faceparty, Facebook,\nMyspace, Myface: social\nnetworking seems to be the\nthing we do best nowadays.\nRewind ten years and the\ndark world of chat rooms was still very\nmuch taboo and treated as unsafe and\nslightly seedy. However, with our ever-growing dependence on technology we\nhave overcome this reticence and are\nnow embracing it whole heartedly.\nMy first, brief experiences with online \u2018networking\u2019 began through AOL\nonline chat where chat rooms are\nthemed, aimed towards particular interests and pursuits. People were only\nidentifiable by their screen name and a\nvery limited profile covering \u2018a/s/l\u2019 and\nperhaps a few details of other hobbies.\nOn the one hand the risk of assuming a false identity was made easier,\nalthough the absence of pictures and\ninformation regarding friends, family\nand associates made it slightly harder\nfor you to be tracked down. Facebook\nprofiles are a stalker\u2019s dream come\ntrue: addresses and phone number\nare accessible (if the user chooses to\ndivulge such information) but for the\nmost part \u2018facebookers\u2019 exercise caution in what they choose to share and\nprivacy options.\nWhat worries me is the apparent\ntime that teenagers spend on social-ising silently and alone. On a recent\nchat show involving 15-18 year olds, it\nseemed that the time spent online was\na daily average of 5 hours! It is no wonder this government is in an uphill battle against obesity and heart disease.\nApart from the obvious detriment to\none\u2019s health if such a large portion of\nthe day is spent sedentary, I find that\nafter even a few hours of looking at a\ncomputer screen my eyes are strained\nand I am left with a headache.\nThe young people interviewed protested that it was for lack of anything\nbetter to do that they resorted to hours\nmesmerised by the comings and goings of their peers. The drinking age of\n18 stops them spending those valuable\nhours in the park after dark damaging their livers instead and so the Internet is required. Who raised these\nunimaginative children? What about\nthe wealth of authors, poets, artists to\nwhich we have free access in museums\nand libraries? How about a walk along\nthe South Bank, in Hamsptead Heath\nor a boogie in your bedroom with iPod\nblasting if the thought of actual human\ncontact has you breaking out a sweat.\nAnother thing I despair for is the\ncalibre of grammar and general use of\nthe English language adopted by many\nonline, not all of them without basic\nG.C.S.E. English. Unless you have\nlearned the incorrect spelling of words\n(\u201csez\u201d, \u201cskool\u201d, \u201c\u2019avin\u2019\u201d) surely it is easier\nto use the correct spelling rather than\ntake those extra few seconds to work\nout how they are spelled phonetically?\nSome of the spellings do not even minimise the number of times the fingers\nneed to come into contact with the\nkeyboard (\u201cchoon\u201d for example). However, we live in a society of freedom of\nspeech (for now) and so people must\nbe able to spell as they wish.\nBack to the subject in hand: Facebook. I use this example, as it is the\nonly site I am held hostage by. My feelings towards my captor are mixed, perhaps even edging towards Stockholm\nsyndrome. I hate the fact my heart\nleaps when I see I have 3 new notifications and maybe even a message or\ntwo. A little sad, perhaps, but I use it\nsolely for entertainment value and ease\nof communication rather than looking\nfor new friends and my total daily use\nis never more than one hour. It means\nI do not have to take pictures anymore:\nI rely on my more camera-savvy friends\nto post theirs up and I can browse happily (or ashamedly, as last night\u2019s memories come back).\nThe army of communication modes\nat our disposal has certainly complicated human relationships and dynamics immensely. Text messages,\nemails and msn conversations are read\ninto; the lack of a response is hailed as\na bad omen, as is the speed of a reply.\nOne person I knew took offense to\nthe number of kisses I left at the end\nof text! The characters of Jane Austen\nnovels were spared so much daily ten-sion, quite content with hearing from\ntheir loved one, by letter, monthly.\nToday, the removal of someone\u2019s relationship status can cause jubilation or\nheartache for those involved.\nOne thing Facebook will prove useful for in the future is the analysis of\nsocieties, examining theories such as\nthe 6 degrees of freedom: a sociologist\u2019s dream come true. But for now\nthey comfort, amuse, irritate, expose,\nwaste time and lower grades. But will\nthese social networking sites fade out\nlike mini disks or are they here forever\nmore?\nfourth year with a mad glint in his eye\nclaims to have made it to the other end\nof the Walkway more often than seems\npossible, and has offered his services to\nescort me safely to the Terra Incognita\non the other side. Have accepted. Will\nbrave the Walkway with Bipolar Jim\nlater this morning.\n13:20\nWhere on Earth am I? Have been walking round for what seems like forever,\nand seem to be slowly but surely retracing my steps. I may not have much\nexploring experience, but I can say,\nwith absolute certitude, that I am quite\ndefinitely lost.\nReached the other end of the Walkway intact \u2013 no thanks to Bipolar Jim.\nHis directional senses are worse than\nuseless \u2013 the ignorance field that emanates from him plays havoc with all\nnavigational devices. My compass has\nstill not recovered from the shock.\nI dispensed with his services as soon\nas was possible, and, with rising trepi-dation, left the Walkway. The part of\nthe College I am now in is illegibly\nmarked on my map with faint pencil.\nAs best as I can make out, this must be\nHoxteth. Or Huxley. Whichever it is,\nthe natives are not friendly.\nThis seems to be an almost exclusively male society, and as a result the\nindigenous culture is quite clearly going to seed. Gaunt men wielding far\nmore notebooks than they could possibly use roam the endless halls inces-santly. My attempt to pass unnoticed in\ntheir midst is so far paying off, though I\nstill have no idea where I am.\n15:30\nThis infernal building is like a rabbit\nwarren. Will attempt to head north.\nCompass still proving unhelpful.\n19:00\nHave made progress! Reached territory as yet unmarked on my map. Can\u2019t\nbelieve I\u2019m the first civilised man to\nset foot in this remote land! It seems\ndauntingly large and quite impenetra-ble, and may be easier to explore to-morrow. Will spend the night in this\nempty bathroom cubicle \u2013 who said\nthe terrain was inhospitable?\nMarch 16th\n18:20\nThree frantically exciting days. Was\nalmost spotted by native search party\nand had to make a quick escape. Potted\nplant in foyer provided excellent cover\ntill yesterday, when I was forced to fend\nfor myself in the great outdoors.\nThis place is worse than Hoxteth \u2013\nit appears to be entirely constructed\nof doors. Leading, needless to say,\nnowhere. Who needs so many doors?\nWhy are they there? To keep people in?\nOr out? So many questions\u2026\nMy supplies of marmite and chutney are running low, and I may need\nto forage for food soon. Careful study\nof inhabitants reveals, surprisingly, a\nhumanoid race, capable of a semi-ar-ticulate form of language as yet incomprehensible to me.\nCautious exploration finds me repeatedly coming face-to-face with\nidolatrous statues of some local deity.\nInscription around base, on close in-spection, seems to read \u2018Blackett\u2019. In\ntribute to the cultural beliefs in this\npart of the world, have decided to\nname this mountainous area on the\nmap and the surrounding lowlands as\nBlackett Mountain.\nImportant to show respect for these\nprimitive people. They like that.\n18:45\nAlmost out of marmite.\nMarch 20th\n15:30\nLast agonising drops of marmite finished last night, and was finally forced\nto go looking for nourishment.\nStrange regional fauna seems capable of distributing plastic-like food if\nshaken hard enough. Small squares of a\nsweet, brown substance kept me going\nduring this morning\u2019s exploration.\nMy first conclusions about this\nmysterious land are overwhelmingly\npositive. The top of Mount Blackett\nprovides a stunning view of the surrounding wilderness. Had an almost\nspiritual moment watching the sun rise\nover the vast rainforest to the East. The\nairhereisconducivetodeep,prolonged\nthought \u2013 my short-lived acquaintance\nwith the natives reveals hidden depths,\nthough an unhealthy obsession with\ndragon balls and unnecessarily powerful lasers seems to be prevalent.\nApril 1st\n15:30\nHave found my true spiritual resting-place. This is where I belong. Here,\namong people whose intellect I can respect and whose interests I can relate\nto. At last. A real science.\nGilead Amit has gone AWOL\n\u201c\nWill spend\nthe night in this\nempty bathroom\ncubicle \u2013\nwho said the\nterrain was\ninhospitable?\n\n"

Will a\ntrip to Pygmalion change all preconceptions or will the middle class hypocrisy be too much to take?\nH\naving spent the first\ntwenty four years of my\nlife successfully avoiding that bastion of bour-geoisie, the theatre (am-ateur productions aside), last weekend\nI finally succumbed. To me the theatre\nrepresents everything that is wrong\nwith the middle class \u2013 a form of entertainment that by its very nature and\nprohibitive cost keeps us away from\nthose terrifying lower-class people\n(I had to pay one pound to place my\ncoat in the lobby!!!) By taste, occupa-tion, and accent I have become middle-class, distancing myself from my family and their social network. Becoming\na theatre-goer would nail the lid in the\ncoffin, but maybe it was worth it? That\nthe play should have been none other\nthan Pygmalion, with its infamous references to \u201cmiddle-class hypocrisy\u201d,\nwas pure coincidence.\nI was surrounded by white, elderly\nladies and gov\u2019nors (although the age\nbracket might have been skewed by\nthe time \u2013 I went to a matinee and I\ndid spot one other black person in my\nrow.) Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not one\nof those oh-pity-me-I\u2019m-Asian, I\u2019mso -underprivileged types, in fact I\nsincerely believe that my \u201cAsian-ness\u201d,\nand my scarf, have been a source of\npositive discrimination. In London, at\nleast, your upbringing and your school\nhas more consequence than any genetic misfortunes you have inherited. It\njust happens that the majority of Black\n(and by that I mean brown in all its\ndifferent shades) people have still not\nlearnt the tricks to get their kids into\ngood schools.\nTime to go back to the play. I have\nalways loved Pygmalion. Considering\nmy ingrained distrust of the theatre,\nI thought Shaw\u2019s sparkling comedy\nwould be a fair place to start. And it\nwould not offend my Victorian values\n(which I am very proud of, by the way.\nI think the world is in such a mess because we have lost those Victorian val-ues). And I have to admit it was quite\nentertaining. Well, Act Three was won-derful; I\u2019m not so sure about the begin-ning, it took some time for the actors\nto warm up. Or maybe the actors, from\na middle-class background themselves,\ndo not spend much time with the people they were supposed to portray and\nhence found it difficult to relate? I realise this is a gross generalisation, but all\nthat I know is that Michelle Dockery\u2019s\nEliza was magnificent as the Duchess,\nI don\u2019t know about her Flower Girl.\nThe set and the costumes were beau-tiful, they even had a little back cab\ncrossing the stage at one point! And\nHiggins\u2019 Mother is simply breathtak-ing. Well she did slip up with her triple\nrail against the enigma that is Men \u2013 it\nsounded a tad put-on.\nWhich brings me to my conclusion \u2013\nwas it worth it? Ticket prices range between \u00a310 and \u00a350 but the Old Vic had\na limited number of \u00a312 concessions\nfor the under 25\u2019s. With that money I\ncould have gone to the cinema twice,\nand chosen a good seat (let\u2019s just say\nthe concessionary seats were strategically placed). The movie would have\nbeen crafted (if properly picked) such\nthat every shot, every scenery, every\nsound was tuned to perfection. There\nwould be no annoying interacts. I\nwould not have felt so out of place. No\nguilt involved either \u2013 the cinema is the\nonly form of entertainment where people from all class come together under\none roof (and maybe football but then\nyou still have graded seats). Will I go\nagain? Borrowing Eliza\u2019s most famous\nline \u2013 Not B***** likely! (Sorry- those\nVictorian sensibilities again)\nPygmalion is on at The Old Vic\nuntil 2nd August 2008.\nTim Piggot-Smith as Henry Higgins and Michelle Dockery as Eliza Doolittle\n\u201cEliza was magnificent as the Duchess\u201d. But does her \u2018flower girl\u2019 match up?\n18 Friday 6 June 2008\nfelix\n\n"

It evokes images of tribal rituals\ncarried out around huge, midnight fires\non beaches: I was transported back to\nBali immediately! The singing is traditionally paired with reenactment of the\nRamayana by shadow puppets which is\nalso a very popular practice in India.\nShadow puppets on display are crafted\nfrom perforated animal hide, mounted\nusing bamboo sticks, lit with candles\nand oil lamps.\nThe original Ramayana was initially\ndisseminated by the poem written by\nValmiki. So touched with pity by the\ndeath of two mating birds by an arrow,\nhe began reciting in a new type of verse\nform (sloka) and the epic metre was\ncreated in which the story of Rama was\nborn. Bards tour towns in India with\ntravelling shrines, adorned with im-ages, reciting versions in the original\nmetre or in vernacular versions. Rather\nlike classical epics such as the Iliad and\nthose of our very own Bard (Shake-speare), the version of the Ramayana\nin its original form is only understood\nby the highly educated and so the need\nfor retelling in so many other ways is\nnecessary. Play versions were written by playwrights such as Bhasa (3rd\nCentury), Bhorabuti (8th Century) and\nMurassi; Bhasa- making these works\nsome of the oldest recorded plays. The\nplaywrights would adhere to the original story, only tightening the plot for\ndramatic purposes.\nOn display are glorious textiles, temple hangings, friezes and photographs\nof sculptures which would have been\nstationed in temples for worship. The\nthreat of northern Muslim invasion\nprompted the people to increase the\npresence of their own deities in temples and throughout the land. In Hindi\nculture it is believed that Rama was the\nseventh avatar, that is the personification of the god Vishnu (the preserver\nand supreme God). The need for the\nrestoration of good to balance out\nevil was required when the 10-headed\nking, Ravana, became arrogant after\nbeing granted super-human strength\nby the Brahma (god of creation), making him invincible even to the gods.\nIn his foolishness, Ravana forgot to\nspecify that his strength protected him\nfrom mere mortals and animals too. In\nthis way, Rama\u2019s quest to rescue Sita\nwas a means to confront and destroy\nthe evil of Ravana. Sita is identified\nwith Vishnu\u2019s eternal consort, Laksmi,\nand the couple together and revered as\nthe perfect marriage ideal. That Rama\nmoved mountains for his love and\nthat Sita maintained this love despite\nadversity makes them the subject of\nmany paintings and very influential in\nHindi culture.\nHanuman, Rama\u2019s monkey compan-ion, ever loyal, and also Shiva\u2019s avatar,\nis a very popular icon with his image\nappearing in countless contexts. Today, he is the main character in many\nmovies, and the exhibition shows some\nglorious paintings of the devoted com-panion. One example has Hanuman\npainted in a deep cornflower blue set\nagainst a contrasting bright yellow\nbackground, wearing a silver necklace\nand his nails painted the same colour.\nA Tamil bronze statue of him has ador-able, friendly features not dissimilar\nfrom the well-known Dr Seuss character \u2018the Cat\u2019 (of Hat fame).\nThis free exhibition is a delight to\nattend. Not only attractively laid out:\nblack ceilings paired perfectly with coloured walls and a huge ten foot model\nof Ravana, but smelling fragrant and\nexotic, once again bringing me right\nback to the smells of Bali and making\nme want to set off immediately for India, hitherto uncharted territory. This\ncollection not only offers stunning art\nbut a chance to learn reams on a different culture.

And if you love to\nsee live bands then there is no better place to spend\nthe warm summer months than swanning\nfrom festival to festival.\nThis year we feel it is becoming\nincreasingly desirable to explore\nEuropean festivals. Less crowded,\nless rain, more adventure\nand better value for money\noverall than a good deal of the\nburgeoning money spinners\nmasquerading as festivals over\nhere in good ol\u2019 Blighty.\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t\nsome wonderful English\ndates for your dairy this year\n\u2013The Isle of Wight Festival,\nWild in The Country,\nLatitude and who could\ndare to omit Reading\nFestival. We\u2019re not going\nO\nne of the strongest\ndraws of Dour is\nwithout a doubt its\nprogramme. Every\nyear at Dour you get\na unique international bill (bands\nwere coming from 28 different\ncountries last year) that\u2019s different,\nalternative, independent, ambitious\nand sharp with an accent on new\ndiscoveries. All that at a very low\nprice that can\u2019t be beaten.\nSince its beginning the Dour Festival has owed much of its appeal to\nits incredible atmosphere. A multicultural audience that shares a love\nfor music and partying creates a fun\nvibe throughout the site. The Dour\nFestival has become the unmissable music event of the summer\nfor thousands of music fans across\nEurope.\nLike every summer the festival\nwill be held on the 3rd weekend of\nJuly, by the spoil heaps of the old\ncoal mining site \u2018La Plaine de La\nMachine a Feu\u2019. Dour the village is\nsituated in the south of Belgium, by\nthe French Border. For 4 days over\n200 bands will play their tunes on\n2 open-air stages and 4 marquees\nin front of an avid audience. This\nis the festival that never sleeps with\nnon stop music from 12am until\n5am the next day.\nThe festival\u2019 social agenda is not a\nsideshow anymore. People come to\nDour to get informed as well thanks\nto our NGO village. This summer\nwill be the 4th time the festival will\nwelcome many social and political\nassociations to inform the festival\ngoers about NGO\u2019s and what can\nbe done to help the planet.\nWe were lucky enough to get to\nDour festival last year, and in our\nopinion, having attended almost\nevery UK festival over the last 12\nyears, this was by far one of the\nbest we\u2019ve seen. The tickets are crazy cheap (85 Euros for 4 days), and\nif you\u2019re so cheap you can\u2019t even afford to pay for some (like us) then\nwe seriously suggest you email in to\nwin a pair of free tickets, because\nyou\u2019ll have an almost 100% chance\nof winning.\nwww.dourfestival.be\nOur Favourite Bands\nfrom the lineup:\nFoals\nAlter Ego\nPendulum\nBattles\nMystery Jets\nBoys Noize\nSuperlux\nEfterklang\nIce Cube\nHatebreed\nFujiya and Miyagi\nOur Favourite Bands\nfrom the lineup:\nJustice\nRadiohead\nR.E.M\nVampire Weekend\nSoulwax\nThe Chemical Brothers\n2ManyDJs\nSlayer\nDigitalism\nNeil Young\nSigur Ros\nWIN TICKETS!\nBelgium: 17 \u2013 20th July\nBelgium: 3 \u2013 6th July\nWe\u2019ve got 5 pairs of tickets\nfor Dour Festival to give\naway to our readers, just\nemail in to nightlife.felix@\nic.ac.uk or text DOUR to\nthe Catfone: 07980 148 785\nR\nock Werchter 2008\nwill take place from\nThursday 3 until\nSunday 6 July at Werchter\u2019s Festival Park.\nThe festival is a broad overview of\nall the interesting and good things\nthat are going on in pop, rock and\ndance. The best rock band in the\nworld, the most exciting young\nBritish bands, the new kings of\ndance,thereturnofsomeold-time\nfavourites. Guitars, electro, loved,\nunknown, headbang, sing along,\ndance, everything! As always, big\nnames and established acts will\nbe playing the Main Stage, these\ninclude Radiohead, R.E.M., Justice, The Chemical Brothers and\nmany, many more. The Pyramid\nMarquee is reserved for upcoming talent and more intimate acts\nfrom around Europe.\nEvery day, there is room for\n80,000 visitors, and the large spaces mean you won\u2019t be crammed\nup against some wasted, sweaty\nfellow festival goer everywhere\nyou step. ..\nAlways pulling huge names, It\u2019s\nhard to believe this massive four\nday event grew out of a small\nblues festival in 1975, but since\nits first incarnation the event has\nhoused musical giants such as\nDavid Bowie, The Specials, Muse\nand Radiohead and more.\nThis festival is our top suggestion for the summer, four days\nlong and less than the price of a\nstandard UK festival you can see a\nridiculously large number of huge\nacts for just one ticket. Tickets\nare available from www.rockwer-chter.be and cost 160 Euros.\nWith all the insanely cheap\nbeer you can drink (not Carling\neither), amazing bands, cheap\nfood, cheap ticket, cheap Eurostar\ntickets available at the moment,\ngreat weather and lack of 16 year\nold rich indie kids filling the place\nup you\u2019d be crazy to opt for one of\nthe bigger UK festivals.\n\n"

And now imagine that you are a young,\nbright and popular student at a prestigious university who happens to be\ndoing a dissertation on Communism\nfor your degree.\nNow, like any self-respecting stu-dent, you go off to the library to do\nsome research and check out this book\nthat all the boffins recommend \u2013 Communism for Dummies. You take it back\nto your department, but wander off for\na moment. Unfortunately for you, one\nof your vigilant colleagues sees this little book, gets a bit uneasy and decides\nto call the cops. Oh, and I forgot to\nmention that you\u2019re actually a Russian\nimmigrant who has sought refuge in\nthe US after fleeing Mother Russia and\ndecided to live the American Dream.\nRight, so the cops come out and arrest you and then detain you without\ncharge. At the same time, your family\ngets harassed, your home gets raided\nand property gets confiscated. Your\nname is in all the papers and your ethnic community is now under attack.\nAnd to top it all off you have brought\nin an air of controversy and damaged\nthe prestige of your institution.\nThe cops and judges decide that you\ndon\u2019t really need to be here as your paperwork looks a bit iffy and they decide to send you on the first plane back\nhome, where your comrades are waiting in open arms for their lost brother\nto return.\nWhat on earth, you ask, is the point\nof all this historical fictional babble?\nWell, just recently a modern-day classic\ntook place at Nottingham University.\nHicham Yezza, an Algerian-born\nemployee at Nottingham, decided to\nmake use of his free printer credits\nto print the edited Al-Qaida Training Handbook (available from the US\nDepartment of Justice website) for his\nPakistani-born mate Rizwaan; who\nwas writing a dissertation on Islamic\nextremism for his MA in Politics. They\nwere both \u2018caught\u2019 and arrested without charge. Hicham was subsequently\nre-arrested because his immigration\nstatus wasn\u2019t quite up to standards \u2013\neven though he had been living in the\nUK for 13 years and had his citizenship papers being processed before\nthe whole debacle took place. He was\ndue to be deported last Sunday, but the\nHome Office have since had a re-think,\nfollowing a national campaign.\nWhy am I telling you all this? Is it\nbecause he was checked into the fast-track service for deportation without\na hearing? Or is it the apparent sensationalist response to both men\u2019s ethnic\nand religious origins? Imagine if they\nwere Swedish Goths... No, the real reason is a little something we like to call\nacademic freedom.\nThat is the right for academics to\nhave the right to engage in research,\nand to teach subjects that are deemed\nto be controversial without fear of per-secution. This issue was highlighted\nback in 2005 when the government\nmade amendments in the Anti-Terror\nlegislation which was designed to stop\nacademic persecution from occurring.\nBut even then there was some pessimism as to how far the new measures\nwould go. Furthermore the whole affair\nhas raised questions about the government\u2019s insistence to raise the detention\nlimit from 28 days to 42 days without\ncharge.\nThe likelihood of such an incident\nhappening at Imperial is rather remote,\nthanks to the distinct lack of research\nin social sciences that goes on around\nhere. But, there is a danger that ethnic\nand racial profiling, alongside encouraging lecturers and staff to monitor\nand report the activities on campus\nmay prevail.\nAnd that would be a real throwback\nto the 50s.\nA. Geek\nLet the grown ups get on with it\nC\naz Knight\u2019s charming\npiece last week about how\njolly revolutions were was\nsomething of a wake-up\ncall to me. There I was,\nassuming that socialism had gone the\nway of the Teletubbies and thick-cut\nmarmalade in becoming unfashionable\nand childish, only to find that there\u2019s at\nleast one brave soul out there who still\nfeels that whining and bashing things\nup actually helps society get along. It\u2019s\nheartwarming,notonlybecauseitgives\nme the opportunity to be extremely\npatronising \u2013 isn\u2019t that right, champ? \u2013\nbut also because it means there\u2019s still\na few people out there whose spirits\nneed crushing. Start your engines.\nHere\u2019s a cold, hard truth for you ladies and gentlemen \u2013 revolutions slow\nus down. And yeah, I\u2019m talking about\n\u2018progress\u2019. It\u2019s in single quotes rather\nthan double, because I don\u2019t look down\non it as much as most of you seem to.\nProgress is what gives us the Industrial\nRevolution, it gives us comfortable\nshoes and it gives us movies featuring\nMatt Damon.\nIt holds it hands up. It says \u2018Sure, people got permanently disfigured by unsafe machinery. Yes, children died with\ntheir hands bleeding onto the floor in\nAsian sweatshops. And the side effect\nof Dogma was that Ben Affleck\u2019s career\nwill be forever remembered.\u2019 It knows\nits faults. But you know what? It just\nwaxes its stereotypical mustache, rea-ligns its top hat and tails, and waddles\non down the street to the nine o\u2019clock\nGravy Train to Profit Towne.\nI want to be absolutely clear once and\nfor all \u2013 I might make love to Mother\nNature like it\u2019s going out of style, and\nI might believe that, occasionally, it\u2019s\nbad to take advantage of people. But\na lot of my core beliefs are more right\nwing than a Boris Johnson-themed\nKentucky Fried Chicken meal, and\nthat\u2019s because I like it when things happen and people get on with their lives.\nCaz might think \u2018hedonism\u2019 is a fundamental part of human nature, but\npeople used to think that dying cold,\nalone and in a pool of your own faeces\nwas a fundamental part of being alive.\nThen we realised that if we worked really hard we could heal them. Although\nsome people optionally kept the faeces\nbit, which is fine.\nI\u2019m not rich. I don\u2019t have any privilege or class benefits that I\u2019m aware of.\nI just think that if we want to organise\nsix billion people in any meaningful\nway, then someone has to be at the top\ngetting most of the glory and a large\nproportion of the Innocent smoothies,\nand some people need to be crawling\nthe bottom feeding off of flakes of Basics onions and urine-soaked copies of\nThe London Lite.\nI\u2019m sure Caz has solutions to this\nproblem that don\u2019t involve the little\nguy getting shat on, and I\u2019m sure many\nof them don\u2019t involve people with long\nhair and bandanas shouting in Spanish despite being from Gloucester. But\nthe fact that remains is this \u2013 revolutions are a condensed form of human\nstupidity. They are that moment where\nwe decide that the last eight thousand\nyears wasn\u2019t really worth our time, and\n\u201c\nPeople\nused to think\nthat dying cold,\nalone and in\na pool of your\nown faeces was\na fundamental\npart of being\nalive\ngiving in to raw emotion is a much\nmore sensible way to go.\nIt\u2019s when you do the \u2018student\u2019-y thing.\nYou start sentences with \u2018fuck\u2019 and\nthen append the name of something\nthat people seem to be vaguely disapproving of. Then everyone shouts and\ngets up off their chairs in JCR and goes\noff to huff and be all angry somewhere.\nSometimes it\u2019s on the street. Mostly it\u2019s\non the internet. Maybe, sometimes, it\u2019s\nright here on these pages.\nAs long as you all stay there, it\u2019s fine.\nWe know where to look if we need irra-tional, emotional people who couldn\u2019t\norganise a fart into spreading around\na room. When the population of the\nearth has been whittled down to a few\nthousand people \u2013 as no doubt it will,\nthanks to humankind\u2019s natural idiocy\nthat fuels revolution \u2013 then you can\ntake over. You can stir people up and\npush them into action, founding a new\nsociety which will learn how you saved\nmankind from the wrong of the past.\nUp until that point, the grown-ups\nhave work to do in order to stop impending armageddon. So if you can all\njust play nicely in the corner, and we\u2019ll\npick you up after our meeting.\nAnd really, in this day and age, who\nwould just get angry over nothing on a\nweek basis? Some cunt.

Only three weeks before the proposed date, opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai was arrested\nfor \u2018planning to attend an unauthorized meeting\u2019 in the south of the country, before being released several\nhours later. The arrest is frustrating news for critics of Mugabe\u2019s regime, who see their chance of replacing\nhim decreasing with time. Mugabe has also come under renewed criticism for his agricultural policies, given\nhis sudden eagerness to criticise the West for some of his own domestic troubles. Most recently, however, he\nhas been accused of ordering some 30 aid agencies to halt operations, increasing the suffering in the South\nAfrican nation.\nFood Crisis Continues\nItaly\nThe UN met in Rome earlier this week to approve the allocation\nof $1.2 billion to the 62 countries most severely affected by this\nyear\u2019s food crisis. The cost of basic foodstuffs is rising and riots\nover the prices have led to national instability in a variety of\nhot-spots around the world. Whilst this year\u2019s terrible harvests\nare largely to blame, the increasing subsidies awarded to the\nuse of crops as biofuels have intensified the problem. The\nUN\u2019s actions are set to prevent the number of people below\nthe survival line doubling in the near future - a very real risk.\nPresidents Mugabe and Ahmadinejad have joined forces to\nblame the West for the global situation, criticisms which, from\nMugabe\u2019s part, are deemed highly hypocritical.\nF\nirst things first. We have\na democratic presidential nominee for the\nUS elections. Finally.\nClinton may have been\noffered the VP position by the\ntime of going to print but at the\ntime of writing, nothing has been\nconfirmed. Whether or not the\nObama-Clinton combination receives the support of their respective voters, it has advantages that\ncould be too good to miss. We\u2019ll\nsee. The election is not going to\nbe out of the headlines for long.\nNow on to another election.\nZimbabwean presidential challenger Morgan Tsvangirai has\nbeen arrested three weeks before the scheduled run-off.\nThen released. I\u2019m leaving my\ncynicism in the bag on this one.\nCome to your own conclusions.\nBurma has made it back here\nthis week; the suffering of millions in the far East deserves\nanother chance in the spot-light. \u201cWatch in Wonder as Aid\nis Deprived from Millions - be\nAmazed by the \u2018feel-bad spectacular of the year \u2018 (Guardian)\u201d.\nThe 2007/8 food crisis is making its debut performance this\nweek; be kind. It really has been a\nyear of appalling harvests around\nthe world; though the belief that\ncrops should serve as bio-fuel\nrather than nourishment is making things far worse than they need\nto be. By the way - Ahmadinejad\nand Mugabe agree that the whole\nproblem is caused by the West.\nNice to see trans-national agreement on something, I suppose.\nAnyone reading this must still be\natcollege,andIassumemust,there-fore, still have exams. Good luck.\nElection Results IV\nUnited States\nEarlier this week, Senator Barack Obama became the official Democratic nominee for the upcoming Presidential elections.\nAfter months of exhausting debates and prolonged contests in every state, Obama finally obtained the support of enough\ndelegates to secure the nomination. With the leader of the Democratic ticket now confirmed, the identity of the VicePresidential is the subject of increased speculation. Senator Clinton, who has not yet conceded defeat, is clearly the obvious\ncandidate. Despite the lack of any official announcement from the Clinton campaign on this subject, indications from all\ndirections show that she would be willing to accept the vice-presidential candidacy. The potential \u2018dream-team\u2019 of Obama\nand Clinton could be hugely effective in uniting the Democratic party and silencing criticisms of Obama\u2019s inexperience, but\nthe move may prove unpopular with supporters of both candidates. Obama has since appointed a triumvirate of experienced\nDemocrats to assist him in chooising someone to fill the number two spot.\nGilead Amit\n\n"

Sitting at the breakfast ta-ble, liberally spreading a glaze of jam\nacross my ham, I came into conversation with a beautiful French girl, and\nwe began to bond over a shared dislike\nof poorly-cooked oatmeal.\nNot being helped by an ill-judged\nand slightly racist comment by my fellow travelling companion about French\ncuisine (he claimed later that he did\nnot realise the nature of her national-ity, a claim I can only fail to believe due\nto her outrageous French accent), I at-ing prayers we were ready to face the\nnew day head on, but not before the\nmuch anticipated free breakfast \u00a9. The\nhot option of oatmeal was discounted\non principle and thus we were left with\nthe now legendary delicacy of toast\nwith ham, cheese, and jam. The ham,\ncheese and jam combination is now\nlargely overlooked in Blair\u2019s Britain,\nhowever, during the 17th century restoration period, as copious indulgence\nled to the acquisition of the Jam colo-niesfromthethenRhodesiacausingthe\nnow notorious jam flood of London\u2019s\nEast End, endless ham and jam houses\nsprouted up. As we know, cheese was\ntempted to rescue the situation with\na quip about her upward inflexion at\nthe end of sentences which went down\nabout as well as a Gordon Brown rap\nconcert. As she left the table I cursed\nmy awful small talk and ate my jam like\na good Christian boy.\nOur hopes were high for the fresh\nday, our morale barely dented by my\nprevious brush-off and so we set out\nto look at a young girl\u2019s attic. Our trip\nwas planned like a military operation,\nalbeit one without a map and a clear\nsense of direction, so we were reliant\non the maps provided at information\npoints throughout the city.\nNow I do not want to necessarily\ncome over as critical of the Dutch grid\nreferencing system, but I could have\nbeen clearer in my labelling system of\nhistoric city sites aided by only a ham\nand jam crayon. As a result of the blundering city cartographer, we arrived at\nAnne Frank\u2019s pad only to find it had\nbeen converted into a zoo containing among other animals: Warthog,\nHeron, and Llama. Looking at a small\nschoolchild waving at a distressed pea-cock, I sensed we may not have honed\nin on the \u2018secret annex.\u2019\nOur disastrous day was only compounded by a hastily planned trip to the\nAjax stadium where we were informed\nby a haughty blonde that tours of the\nstadium had been cancelled due to a\nconcert by a non-specific band which\nI latter found out were called \u2018De toppers\u2019. It was a bitter disappointment.\nThe next day, having used a series\nof GPS pigeons to finally locate what\nthe Nazis had failed to do for so long,\nwe paid \u20ac7.50 and filed into a small\nhouse at number 267, Prinsengracht\nStreet. I am not going to make cheap\njokes about what was, at times, a moving exhibition but I will point out that\nthe choice, by an Canadian tourist, to\nhum out loud \u2018The Final Countdown\u2019\nupon exiting the secret Annex was at\nbest, ill-judged.\nRelaxing later in a sunny \u2018Oosterpark\u2019 surrounded by a pack of dogs that\nseemed strangely attracted to the belt\non my jeans (I really don\u2019t know why\nthis was, a sentiment I repeated later to\na stern looking customs official) we reflected on an error-filled, but ultimately enjoyable trip and decided to go and\nfind another harassed peacock.\nIf you can\u2019t find Anne Frank, this is what you can do...\nAmsterdam. Caution advised when seeking out accommodation...\nMeeting Jesus, flirting with French women and cruising over to Anne Frank\u2019s pad; it\u2019s all in a day or two\u2019s\nwork for the Travels Without My Aunt crew.

    "content": "5\nFriday 6 June 2008 felix\nD\nepression is not simply\na state of feeling sad all\nthe time. This is a very\ncommon misconception\nof the illness, and in re-ality, a sufferer\u2019s level of depression is\nvery hard to define. The extent of depression falls into one of three broad\ncategories:\nMild Depression\nThe low mood may come and go and\nthe illness starts after a specific stressful life event. Anxiety may be present\ntoo. Lifestyle changes may be enough\nto lift this kind of depression.\nModerate Depression\nLow mood is persistent and physical\nsymptoms are present too. Changes in\nlifestyle are unlikely to work and medical help is needed.\nSevere Depression\nThis is a life-threatening illness in\nwhich symptoms are intense. Physical\nsymptoms as well as delusions and hallucinations are present. Medical help is\nurgently required.\nDifferent names are also given for types\ndepression depending on symptoms:\nReactive Depression\nThis describes a depression that is\ncaused by a stressful event and doesn\u2019t\nusually last long. Counselling, family\nsupport and practical steps may be all\nthat is required.\nEndogenous Depression\nThis is depression that comes on for no\nreason. It\u2019s usually intense and physical\nsymptoms are more likely. It cannot be\ntreated without medical help.\nBipolar Disorder\nAlso known as manic depression.\nThere are sustained high moods and\nsustained low moods which can range\nfrom mild to severe depression. During highs sufferers feel elated, need\nless sleep, have bags of energy, speak\nquickly and can have delusions and\nhallucinations.\nThese can be just as destructive as\nthe lows, due to reckless behaviour or\npoor judgement.\nSeasonal Affective Disorder\nA specific type of depression that may\nresult from decreasing levels of daylight as winter approaches and days\nshorten.\nHow is depression treated and what options are available to sufferers?\nF\nor mild depression, there\nare lots of self-help plans\nthat can be found online. It\u2019s\nworth seeing your GP even\nif you want to use self-help\nbecause they can offer independent,\nobjective advice.\nSometimes just taking a break when\nyou feel down can help you feel much\nbetter. Talking things over with a friend\ncan help you feel better too. The open\nacknowledgement of your problems\nis often the starting point for working\nout solutions.\nLifestyle changes, such as exercise,\ncan boost well-being and make you fitter at the same time. Your GP can also\nadvise you on relaxation techniques.\nTaking up a new hobby or activity\ncan keep you occupied and it breaks\nthe pattern of loneliness and sitting at\nhome worrying about problems.\nBeyond self-help, there are three\nmain types of treatment available\nfor depression: psychological treat-ment, drug treatment and physical\ntreatment.\nPsychological therapies or conversational therapies are the most popular\ntype of treatment for depression. Getting to the bottom of what causes depression and talking about feelings is\nthe main idea. All psychological treatments take a lot of time and commitment and are not an easy option.\nBrief therapies last up to six months\nand usually consist of 4 to 20 weekly\nsessions, of one hour each. They usually deal with problems in the present,\nsuch as a relationship breakdown or\nexam stress. Many brief therapies are\navailable on the NHS and your GP may\nrecommend one.\nLonger term therapies usually consist of more than 50 sessions, and are\noften weekly or more than once week-ly. These deal with the past and try to\ndiscover why you are the way that you\nare. Sufferers may be able to attend\nlong-term therapies on the NHS, but\nwaiting lists are long and they are definitely not a quick fix.\nCounselling lasts for a variable time, from one session\nonwards. It doesn\u2019t aim\nto change deep rooted\nproblems or treat de-pression, but it may get\nrid of some of the problems\nthat are causing the\ndepression.\nFor some peo-pledrugssuchas\nantidepressants\ncan be a very effective treatment.\nThey work by increasing\nthe neurotransmitters in\nthe brain\u2019s synapses and are\nbest for moderate and severe\ndepression. Anti-depressants are\nnot addictive but they are powerful\ndrugs that aim to lift your mood, rather\nthan to bring on a high.\nThey don\u2019t eliminate\ndepression out-right, instead\nthey are intended\nto raise a sufferer\u2019s\nmood enough so\nthat they are well\nenough to tackle\ntheir depression with\nother means, such\nas self-help or\ntherapy.\nThere are\nmany different\ntypes of antide-pressants, and some\nsuit people better\nthan others. If your\nGP recommends antidepressants then it\u2019s important for you to make an\ninformed decision. Do some reading\nWhen and how to get help, and where to search for it\nI\nf your low mood affects all parts\nof your life, lasts for two weeks\nor brings you to the point of\nthinking about suicide, you\nshould seek help. Try to think\nof depression as an illness that can be\ntreated. Ninety per cent of people with\ndepression can be treated by their GP,\nwho have years of experience of dealing with it. Friends are also a great\nsource of comfort and help. If you\ncannot talk to your GP, try to talk to a\ntrusted friend.\nIf you are thinking about suicide, you\nare at risk of doing it. Get help urgent-ly: see a GP, go to Accident or Emergency Department, tell a friend or call\na helpline, such as the Samaritans. Depression can be treated.\nIf you know someone suffering from\ndepression, remember that it can be\nvery hard for them to approach you\nwhen they are feeling bad. Try to encourage them to seek treatment from\nprofessionals. Don\u2019t blame them for\nbeing depressed, they are probably\nalready blaming themselves.

Laura Starr investigates if this really is the full story\n\u201cP\nlace the chocolate-iced custard-filled\ndoughnut back on the\nsecond shelf and step\naway from the fridge,\u201d\nwhispers the voice in my head as I\u2019m\nabout to indulge in my guilty pleasure.\nMy conscience overrides my taste buds\nand I restrain myself from consuming\nthe fourth delicacy of the day \u2013 the one\nthat would push me forward another\n300 calories and eight grams of saturated fat.\nIt has long been thought that being overweight was simply a result of\novereating. One consumes an excess of\ncalories resulting in those pounds piling on \u2013 this being the sole explanation\nfor an expanding waist line. Until now.\nOne group of scientists is adamant\nthat our genetic make-up has a vital\nrole to play. It is not only our actions\nthat stimulate the onset of these consequences but in a large proportion of\ncases it could be down to our genes \u2013\nthe building blocks of life.\nIn the past little has been known\nabout the influence of genetics on illnesses associated with obesity, such as\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes.\nBut Professor Jaspal Kooner and his\ncolleagues at Imperial College London found that half of the population\ncontains a specific sequence of genes\nclosely associated \u201cwith waist size,\nbody mass index and insulin resist-ance, which is a pre-diabetic state.\u201d\nThe uncovered sequence is positioned next to a gene, named MC4R,\nwhich is responsible for regulating\nenergy levels in the body by influencing how much we eat and how much\nenergy we expend or conserve. Kooner\nand his colleagues think that this sequence is responsible for controlling\nthe MC4R gene.\nStudies like this are key in finding\nnew ways to tackle the world\u2019s weight\nproblem. The number of obese children is rapidly increasing, leading to\nthe threat of a global obesity crisis.\nHere in the UK 1 in 10 six year-olds\nsuffer from the disease, thereby increasing their susceptibility to major\nhealth problems.\n\u201cUsing this research, you can do one\nof two things,\u201d explained Prof Kooner.\n\u201cYou can identify the people that are at\nrisk and work on prevention, or develop antagonists.\u201d As the position of the\ngene sequence and its protein product\nare both known the challenge is to now\n\u201cdevelop antagonists to protein products that may ultimately turn out to be\ndrug targets.\u201d\nInterestingly, the gene sequence was\nfound to be around 30% more common\nin the Indian Asian rather than European lineage. This could explain why\nthere is a greater prevalence of obesity\nand insulin resistance in Indian Asians.\nThe sub-group makes up around 25%\nof the world\u2019s population but will account for 40% of global cardiovascular\ndisease by 2020. Lead author Dr John\nChambers stressed the importance of\nhis research; \"The number of people\ninvolved, the comparisons between\ntwo ancestries, and the detail with\nwhich we can explore genetic and environmental effects are helping us identify crucial linkages.\"\nUsing a genetic approach to combat\nthe disease is promising. Our genetic\nmake-up cannot be altered, however,\nwe can focus on the development and\napplication of preventative and innovative measures, for action needs to\nbe taken. Action in the form of backing such studies, supporting research\nagainst a disease that is at present a burden to an estimated 300 million people\nworldwide. Who may all be pleased to\nhear that there\u2019s finally, some evidence\nthat over-indulgence might not be the\nonly thing to blame.\nYou're mine now. Whatever the fate of exhibit A, doughnuts, and over-indulgence in general may only be\none suspect in the case of the expanding waistline. Genes like MR4C may yet prove to be the kingpins\nA moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips?\nEating out for greens\nThe concept that locally grown food\nhas a smaller carbon footprint than\nfood grown in other countries may not\ncome as a surprise, but the fact that the\ncarbon footprint for some restaurant\nmeals can be a hundredfold larger than\nthose prepared with locally sourced\nfood might.\nA new report from The University\nof Nottingham - 'The Environmental\nSustainability of the British Restaurant Industry: A London Case Study'\n- found that cuisines that originate\noutside of Europe, which use specialty\ningredients from the home country,\non average, will expend more than five\nkilograms of CO2 per meal, compared\nwith a \"green\" restaurant meal at 51\ngrams.\nThe study, carried out by BSc student\nWill Brookes, cranked through the details for 40 restaurants in London categorised as green, British, European,\nand non-European.\nThisfindinghasfarreachingimpacts,\nconsidering that food transportation\naccounts for 35 percent of the UK's total emissions. But the study isn't calling\nfor a major overhaul of the restaurant\nindustry. As Dr. Nick Mount, Will's\ntutor, reasons, \"If all restaurants did\nsource locally, the dining experience\nwould be uniform and dull.\"\nInstead, they suggest a novel program\nof offsetting the carbon footprint, similar to those for airplane flights, that\nwould add no more than ten pence for\nany meal.\nThe onus should not just be on the\ncustomer to make changes, restaurants can offset the impact themselves by implementing recycling and\ncomposting.\"The UK\u2019s reliance on\nfood prepared for the consumer is at\nan all time high. This puts restaurants\nin a highly prominent position,\" says\nBrookes. \"The restaurant sector has\nthe potential to be at the forefront of\nimproving the sustainability of our\nfood industry.\"\nRecent news: restaurant's carbon footprint and self-healing planes\nBleeding planes\nIt may sound like science fiction, but\naerospace engineers at Bristol University have developed a simple but\ningenious idea for self-repairing materials that is inspired by nature, such\nthat damaged aircraft could mend\nthemselves automatically, even during\na flight. Similar to our human bleeding\nand clotting mechanism, the otherwise\nhollow fibers in fiber reenforced polymer composites are filled with a resin\nand hardener, such that when the fibers are broken, the resin and hardener\nflows out, enabling the composite to\nrecover up to 80-90% of its original\nstrength.\n\u201cThis approach can deal with small-scale damage that\u2019s not obvious to the\nnaked eye but which might lead to serious failures in structural integrity if\nit escapes attention,\u201d says Dr Ian Bond,\nwho has led the project. By tinting the\nresin with dye, any \u2018self-mends\u2019 can be\nidentified along with larger-scale damage during ground inspections, and repaired if necessary.\nBut the mimicry of biological systems won't stop there. \u201cThis project\nrepresents just the first step\u201d, says Ian\nBond. \u201cWe\u2019re also developing systems\nwhere the healing agent ... actually\nmoves around as part of a fully integrated vascular network, just like the\ncirculatory systems found in animals\nand plants.\nSuch a system could have its healing\nagent refilled or replaced and could\nrepeatedly heal a structure throughout its lifetime. Furthermore, it offers\npotential for developing other biologi-cal-type functions in man-made struc-tures, such as controlling temperature\nor distributing energy sources.\u201d\nKerrack!

That\u2019s right,\nImperial College\u2019s beloved RSM!\nThe shameful actions of RSM members at this year\u2019s Bottle Match were\na step too far. RSM members trawled\naround Camborne carrying pitchforks,\ntorches and dildos; brutally violating\nany CSM member they could get their\nhands on and setting our thatched\nhouses alight. One of the worst cases\nwas that of Big Time Willy. Big Time\n(BT) was penetrated by no less than\n5 members of the RSM hockey team,\nthen branded with the RSM logo as if\nhe were a piece of cattle.

I received a letter\nback denying any such behaviour took\nplace, calling me a liar and a cheat.\nHowever, Mr Danny Phantom, I have\nproof (not proof of the stated incident,\nbut proof of something)!\nAfter days of searching, I discovered\noffensive pictures on the Imperial College Union\u2019s Web site. Many stating\nthat we, CSM and the Cornish, are not\ngenetically engineered super humans\nbut actually inbred swine. WE ARE\nNOT INBRED! Just ugly to the max.\nI hope by writing this article you, the\ngeneral populous of Imperial College,\nwill see how scummy the RSM really is;\nI hear they\u2019re trying to become a separate union.

    "content": "25\nFriday 6 May 2008 felix\nT\nhe Belgian festival\nbegan life with one\nstage hosting seven\nbands and just three\nthousand people on\na football pitch in 1985. From\nhumble beginnings to having\nseen almost all major names in alternative rock of the past twenty\nyears, the festival has been going\nfrom strength to strength with a\nburgeoning dance presence in the\nlast decade. This year of 2007 saw\nThe Smashing Pumpkins reunite\nto headline almost all major summer festivals worldwide, making\ntheir third appearance at Pukkelpop since 1993.\nThe main site of the Festival is\npretty huge, a lot of time, money\nand effort has obviously gone into\nnot only the organization but also\nthe construction of the site. The\nstages are huge and the tents are\nenormous and boast sound quality you can only dream of experiencing back home. The Dance\ntent was the most awe inspiring\nthing, as big as an actual club\nback home in London and fully\nfitted with screens at intervals\nthat dropped down along the ceiling and the most incredible sca-lectrix track of moving green LED\nlights above you this was perfectly\ndesigned and certainly the most\nubertastic dance tent I have ever\nbeen in at a festival. The second\ndance arena was almost as big, an\nactual tent with funnelled tops\nand an impressively and decorated inside with enormous glass\nbaulbauls splattered with random\ncoloured paint markings and balloons hanging form the top.\nThe attention given to the\ndance areas clearly mimics the\npopularity of dance music and I\nhave to admit it seemed if not the\nmost popular genre, as popular as\nthe rock music side of things. It\nmakes most British festivals look\nlike a muddy tent in someone\u2019s\nback garden by comparison.\nTickets are 150 Euros, and with\nan almost identical lineup to\nReading (plus more), it\u2019s worth it.\nwww.pukkelpop.be\nOur Favourite Bands\nfrom the lineup:\nM83\nMetallica\nFlaming Lips\nThe Killers\nLightspeed Champion\nAlkaline Trio\nElbow\nKillswitch Engage\nSons And Daughters\nSebastian\nUffie and Feadz\nW\nild in the\nCountry is 18\nhours of nonstop music\nand fun set in\nthe palatial grounds of Hertfordshire\u2019s Knebworth House. Starting\nat 1pm on Saturday 5th July, this\none day festival is set across six\nstunningly decorated marquee\u2019d\narenas, and the addition, this year,\nof a Live outdoor stage. The quality of music on offer provides the\nperfect soundtrack, whilst the Enchanted Wood, a Victorian Fun\nFair, Twisted Tea Rooms and a\ngiant chill-out tepee are just some\nof the surprises in store at Wild in\nthe Country - a day and night of\ngreat music, merry-making and\nmischief.\nHot on the heels of her critically\nacclaimed sold out UK tour, Wild\nin the Country will be Bjork\u2019s only\nUK festival date this year. The\nIcelandic songstress will bring\nher unique and powerful theat-rics to Knebworth. Tracks from\ngroundbreaking albums such as\nVespertine and Volta will be sure\nto enthral all with her renowned\nexpressive performances - one\ndefinitely not to be missed!\nThis years line-up reflects a diverse collection of artists and DJ\u2019s,\nwith a mixture of live performances and DJ sets. This year will see\nsome exclusive performances, the\naforementioned Bjork, and also\nthe confirmed appearance of the\nlegendary Danny Tenaglia.\nThe range of DJs and live acts\nwill mean there is something to\nsuit everyone, and for festival\ngoers, a non-stop 18 hour musical\nmarathon.\nThe live performers playing\nat this years festival are coming\nfrom all over the globe to delight\nthe crowds at Wild in the Country. Iceland\u2019s Bjork will be joined\nby Belgium\u2019s electro/rock outfit\nSoulwax, Australia\u2019s drum and\nbass heroes Pendulum, Battles and\nHercules & Love Affair from the\nStates, as well as a good meaure of\nUK acts. It\u2019s at Knebworth Park,\nand if it tickles your fancy - contact us and well give you a ticket.\nwww.wildinthecountry.co.uk\nOur Favourite Bands\nfrom the lineup:\nSigur Ros\nSoulwax\nFoals\nBattles\nThe Presets\nMetronomy\n2ManyDJs\nKilla Kila\nAnnie Mac\nYousef\nSasha\nThe Field\nWIN TICKETS!\nBelgium: 14 \u2013 16th August\nUK: 5th August\nWe\u2019ve got 2 pairs of tickets\nWild In The Country to give\naway to our readers, just\nemail in to nightlife.felix@\nic.ac.uk or text DOUR to\nthe Catfone: 07980 148 785\nto bother to talk about Glastonbury because it has\ngotten far too big for its Wellingtons in our humble\nopinion, and besides if you didn\u2019t begin to register 5\nmonths ago you know very well you\u2019re not going to\nbe there.\nBelgium is fast becoming a real haven for music\nfestival lovers and if you haven\u2019t been to a festival\nin Europe before then go now and expand your\nmind to the possibilities of living without hype\nand the need to get so mindlessly drunk you can\u2019t\nremember who played what or when anyway.\nBy far the most provincial is Dour. This is it\u2019s 20th\nyear and it promises to be a party. Rock Wercher\u2019s\nline-up kicks ass and Pukkelpop is Reading set in\nmore space and with stages you can feasibly be\nat the front of for every band without even trying.\nPlus European festivals have bands during the day\nand then DJ\u2019s long into the night making for a much\nharder party experience.\nWe at Felix love you, and because of our inherent\nomnipotent benevolence, we have tickets to a fair\nselection of these very festivals to give away. Just\nsend in your name and details and a reason why\nwe should give our love to you in particular and we\nshall bestow our gifts upon those most.\nWritten by Gregory Mead and MAC\n\n"

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nS\no it\u2019s nearly the end of term.\nIf, like myself, you have already finished, you may have\nsuddenly found yourself\nwith a generous amount of\ntime on your hands. What to do with\nit? \u201cTravelling\u201d is an obvious option.\n\u201cLoafing\u201d is another popular one. But\nif you\u2019re travelled out for the time be-ing, feel bad for bumming money from\nthe parentals/overdraft or simply can\u2019t\nbe bothered, what other options are\nthere?\nWell if you\u2019re thinking this after having read Felix Arts for the last year\nduring our current tenure, you must\nbe smoking something impressive (my\nfellow editors might be interested.\nWrite us). If we can\u2019t find anything to\ndo in this city, God knows what we\u2019re\ngoing to do elsewhere! For an individual with an open mind, the options are\n(seemingly) endless. However, sometimes your choices become limited by\ntrivial things like, oh, cashflow. Or personal preference. With regards to the\nformer, though it could be argued that\nyou could be sunning yourself in sunny\nSpain or er, Krakow, with the currently\ngenerous mood of the aviation industry towards consumers, festivals are\nstill a popular option. Right?\nAh, festivals. I remember a time\nwhen \u201cfestivals\u201d used to mean going\nape. When I was 10 years old my older\nbrother went to Donington. The bas-tard. KISS were playing, He came back\nsmug as hell with video footage and a\nbrand new KISS tee, which to this day,\nhe still has not worn. Perhaps the narrow amount of exposure to music a\nten-year old widening out opened my\neyes to the array of activity out there.\nI\u2019d like to say I had made wonderful summer plans, but after having\nscratched a major travel itch last year\nand another issue of Phoenix to conjure in a short space of time, gallivanting wasn\u2019t exactly on the cards.\nHowever, I am going to Paris in a\nfew hours. I\u2019m slightly concerned and\noverwhelmed by the sheer amount of\nart and leisurely pursuits on offer.\nThose of you with an appreciation\nfor the history of fashion will also appreciate Paris\u2019 place in that world as\nits spiritual centre \u2013 hence there are\nmany worthy addresses of former\ncouture houses to fit in, as well as the\ntextile museum and the Jardin des Tuileries, where vast tents are erected\nevery season in which to show runway\npresentations.\nIn light of this, how can we possibly compare to Paris on that front? In\ntruth, I don\u2019t think we can. But never\nmind. London has long been a melting\npot for exciting and raw creative talent.\nIf Paris was the world\u2019s city in the 19th\ncentury and New York in the 20th,\nthen we are shaping up to lay claim to\nthe 21st.\nDavid Paw\nArts Editor\nLove, beasts and valour...\nCaz Knight is transported to India as the British Library opens its latest exhibition\n\u201cA\ns long as mountains\nand rivers shall last\nupon the earth, so\nlong shall the story of\nRama be told among\nmen.\u201d (Valmiki). The story of Rama\n(\u2018Ramayana\u2019 in Sanskrit) is one the\nmost influential of ancient legends in\nIndia and Sri Lanka and has been told\nand re-told constantly since its creation by the sage Valmiki from 500 BC\nto 100 BC. Love and Valour in India\u2019s\nGreat Epic: The Ramayana at the British Library explores this pivotal tale\nthrough over 120 paintings from 17th\ncentury illustrated manuscripts and\nexamines the importance of this epic\nand how it has been brought to life by\ncountless other methods.\nThe story in its entirety spans 7\nvolumes and over 400 paintings, all\nproduced between 1649 and 1653 in\nMewar, South Rajasthan. The region\nadopted the Ramayana as their own\nRoyal Family history and Rama himself as their ancestor. Rama was the\nrighteous ruler and upholder of Hindu\nDharma (social and religious order).\nThe production of the manuscripts\nwas spurred on to rival the illustrated\ndynastic manuscripts of the Mughal\nEmpire, Mewar\u2019s political overlords,\nhence the wealth of stunning paintings\nwhich bring to the life the legend of\nRama and his bride Sita.\nRama won the hand of Sita after successfully mending the bow of the God\nShiva (literally meaning \u2018Auspicious\nOne\u2019, the destroyer God), belonging\nto Sita\u2019s father King Janaka. Shortly\nafter the weddings of Rama and his\nbrothers, he and Sita are exiled from\nAyodhya to the forest of Dandaka following Queen Kaikeyi\u2019s (their mother)\norders. Rama\u2019s younger brother and\ndevoted companion, Laksmana as well\nas Hanuman, the monkey general and\ncommitted friend of Rama accompany\nthem. The strife begins when Sita is\nabducted by the 10-headed king of\nLanka, Ravana, and Rama summons\nan army of monkeys to help rescue her.\nA series of battles ensue between the\nheroes and giants, magicians and demons but in the end love triumphs (as\nit always does) and the ever-chaste Sita\nis returned to Rama and their rightful\nkingdom of Ayodhya.\nThe exhibition takes you on the\njourney through each stage in the adventure whilst allowing you to admire\nthe Rajput paintings which have been\nmagnificently preserved, retaining all\ntheir vivid colour and beauty. Sahibdin is the most important of Mewar\nartists and despite being a Muslim he\nwas comfortable with painting Hindu\nthemes. This seems to offer up a con-tradiction, given the conflict between\nMuslims and Hindus.\nThese mesmerising pieces of art\nare unique given their intricacy and\njust how much detail they hold. The\nsheer volume of time, care and effort\nrequired is apparent from the miniscule brush strokes used to bring to\nlife the people, animals, buildings and\nlandscapes of each scene. The colours\nare bold and contrasting, set apart by\nvigorous lines. A noticeable, favourite\nfeature is the use of golds and silvers\nagainst the other matte colours, the\nsheen of which catches the eye and\nmakes the overall effect of the image\nslightly magical. Another thing which\nsets these paintings apart from European or Islamic illustration is the fact\nthat one image will set about to capture\nseveral episodes of a story. The same\ncharacter may appear twice or thrice in\none picture to depict the progression of\nthe tale. For the purpose of story tell-ing, no attempt is made to recreate an\naccurate perspective of space, volume\nor time in the paintings. The effect\nis dream-like: men with purple skin\nstanding the same height as trees set\nagainst an orange sky. A very marked\ncontrast to the paintings being created\nby Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer\nThe demons try to rouse Ravana\u2019s brother, the prostrate giant Kumbhakarna, by hitting him with weapons and clubs and shouting in his ear\nThe allies launch an assault on the walls of Lanka\n(\u2018Girl with a Pearl Earring\u2019) at the same\ntime in Europe.\nAbout the periphery of the exhibition is a collection of manuscripts,\ncostumes, puppets, textiles, sculptures and other artefacts representing\nthe myriad of other ways in which the\nRamayana has been retold and celebrated throughout the ages, not only\nin India. The story has had influence,\nalbeit not as significant, in Burma,\nThailand, Tibet and other parts of SE\nAsia such as Java. In each region the\nstory is told a little differently. In Thailand, the loyal companion Hanuman is\na sexually active creature who embarks\non amorous adventures on his own,\nentering into a fling with the Golden\nFish Princess. One can see clearly the\ndifferences in style between Indian and\nThai depictions of the same charac-ter. In Java, the story is told through a\n100-strong male chorus chanting (not\n\n"

    "content": "31\nfelix\nFriday 6 June 2008\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nCoxed four empty the tanks for victory\nImperial\u2019s men have Met success in Eton\nThis weekend saw one of the most\nprestigious domestic rowing events\ntake place in Eton; the Metropolitan\nRegatta. While most other university\nsports tend to wind down over the\nsummer, the peak of competitive rowing conveniently occurs in the middle\nof exam season!\nThe Metropolitan Regatta is second\nonly to Henley Royal Regatta in terms\nof quality of racing, and is a vital test\nof speed before racing at Henley. It\ninvolves 6 or 7 crews racing side-by-side over 2 kilometres from a standing\nstart. In physiological terms, it is one\nof the most intense forms of exercise\nin any sport, and lies between a sprint\nand a long-distance race in a horrible\nworld of lactate pain, which most normal people will never have had the joy\nof experience!\nThis year, Imperial had a total of 18\nboats entered in a variety of races at the\n\u2018Met\u2019. Topping the bill was an Imperial\nCollege composite coxless four, featuring Imperial rowers Simon Hislop and\nGeorge Whittaker, as well as Olympic Gold medallist Kieron West. The\nfour\u2019s race on Saturday saw them come\na disappointing 2nd to a Cambridge\nUniversity crew made up of boat race\nveterans. However, a change in crew\norder and adjustment of rigging saw\nthe Imperial 4- turn things around the\nfollowing day to win their \u2018elite\u2019 event\nby 4 seconds.\nIn single sculling boats, Andrew\nGordon and Ole Tietz both raced hard\nin their heats to reach the same semi-final. Ole was able to turn around a 3rd\nplace in his heat to win the semi- and\nsubsequently come a close second in a\ntough final. On Sunday, the two came\ntogether in a double-scull and showed\ntheir excellent speed as a crew by coming 3rd in an \u2018elite\u2019 event (the highest\ncategory of racing, usually featuring\npotential/current internationals). The\nGordon-Tietz double is now hoping to\nfind another two scullers to compete in\na quad at Henley. After this, the duo\u2019s\nthoughts will turn to trials, with Gordon set to enter GB U23 lightweight\ntrials in the autumn and Tietz vying\nfor a place in the German lightweight\nsquad.\nImperial also entered its top 8 into\nan event featuring the fastest crews in\nthe UK. Essentially, the 8 was made up\nof two coxless fours that had raced the\nprevious day and as such was almost,\nbut not quite, a \u2018scratch\u2019 crew. Some\nmembers of the crew approached the\nrace with some trepidation; however,\na good rhythm was quickly found during an extended race warm-up, and\nthe crew attached to the start pontoon\nwith greater confidence.\nThe eight had a quick start, staying in\nthe pack and in touch with the rest of\nthe field. At 1000m the crew were only\n4 seconds behind Durham University;\nthe fastest uni crew in the country.\nSoon after halfway, a member of the\ncrew caught a \u2018crab\u2019 (where the oar\nis not extracted from the water, thus\nIain Palmer\ncausing an unfortunate braking effect).\nHowever, the last 500m saw the crew\nbattling hard once again to finish with\nsignificant speed. With 4 weeks remaining until Henley, the gap between\nDurham and Imperial can be closed,\nprovided the crew really pull together\nas one.\nThe depth of the squad was also\nshown by the 2nd 8, another scratch\ncrew and containing four newcomers\n(this year) to the sport. After boating\n45 minutes before the race, the crew\npractised their start, and immediately\nfound that there was significant speed.\nBy the fourth or fifth practise start; the\nboat was moving surprisingly well and\nscything through the water.\nAfter rowing to the start line, the\neight came under starter\u2019s orders. \u201cAttention\u2026\u2026Go!\u201d. First stroke; draw.\nSecond stroke; draw again, then spin\nup the rate. On stroke five, the stroke\nman almost caught a crab, which\nwould have spelt an effective end to\nthe race. However, the rest of the crew\nrecovered well to reach full length by\nstroke 10 and get off to an excellent\nstart. Throughout the next 2000m the\n\u2018powerhouse\u2019 middle four of Adam Seward, Carlos Schuster, John Dick and\nFrank Murphy maintained the work to\nremain fully in the race and finish ex-cellently. Importantly, this eight overcame their collective lack of experience\nthrough determination and raced very\nhard all the way to the finish. Promisingly, this crew was only 1s slower at\n500m and 3s slower at 1500m than the\n1st 8, showing quality throughout the\nsquad.\nThis week, the build-up really begins for Henley. While many students\nwill be either revising (before exams)\nor drinking (after exams!), spare a\nthought for Imperial\u2019s rowers, who will\nstill be training 11 times a week. By the\ntime you read this, the entire squad will\nhave completed 2k ergometer tests; 2\nkms on the rowing machine, absolutely flat out. I advise you to attempt this\nyourselves for \u2018fun\u2019; have a go at beating\nGeorge Whittaker\u2019s 5\u2019 59.9s (averaging\n1:30 / 500m). I can guarantee that it is\none of the most painful tests known to\nman. However, if this is what it takes\nfor racing success this summer, then it\nis most certainly more than worth it!\nImperial 1st 8 going for a paddle\nNICK\nABLITT\nThe Metropolitan Regatta took place\nlast weekend in the world-class rowing\ncentre at Dorney Lake. This spectacular location will host events in the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012\nand has already been host to Rowing\nWorld Cup 2005 and the World Rowing Championships in 2006. ICBC\nsquads were entered in a range of senior categories for the 2km regatta race\nand departed early on Saturday morning prepared for a tough weekend.\nWhile most boat clubs generally specialise in either rowing (single oar) or\nsculling (two oars), Imperial College\nBoat Club continually finds success\nin both techniques. Coaches Steve\nTrapmore, Ross Smitheman and Brian\nSteele have focused intensively on the\nwomen\u2019s squad, preparing them for\nthe pinnacle of the season; Women\u2019s\nHenley Royal (WHR), which takes\nplace this month on June 20-22. The\nMET regatta is essentially the Golden\nGlobes of the rowing circuit offering\npredictions for possible victories at\nHenley. With WHR just three weeks\naway, racing crews have been largely\ndecided upon and the MET regatta is\na chance to see where crews are expected to rank and if any last minute\nchanges are necessary.\nLightweights Rachael Davies and\nCynthia Mynhardt competed in the\nwomen\u2019s double sculls S2 event, coming second in the opening round and\nfinishing an impressive third place in\nthe final just over four seconds off winners Durham University BC.\nThere was further achievement in\nsculling on Sunday when quadruple\nscullers Claire Waterworth, Rachael\nDavies, Cynthia Mynhardt and Katy\nSmith raced in a straight final. They\nhad a winning time of 7:13.5 with\nMortlake Anglian & Alpha BC trailing\nfor second place in 7:18.22.\nICBC commander-in-chief Erica\nThompson was in action in the women\u2019s S3 single sculls coming second\nin the opening heat and progressing\nto the semi-final but unfortunately\nmissed out on a final place. Jenny Forrester competed in the women\u2019s S2\nsingle sculls and after dominating the\nrepechage proceeded to the final, finishing 5th overall in a time of 8:18.97\nto Reading RC\u2019s pole position finish in\n8:02.74.\nIn the rowing events there were two\ncoxed fours entered in the S3 category,\nwhich due to the volume of entries was\ndivided into two divisions. Imperial\nCollege (A) consisted of Selina Graham, Ro Smith, Deborah Tamulonis\nand Clarice Chung coxed by Connie\nPidoux while I was stroke for Imperial\nCollege (B) comprised of Mackenzie\nClavin, Anna Jones and Deepika Reddy. Both crews finished first in their\nopening heats and progressed straight\nto the final without having to participate in the repechage. The six-hour\ngap between races was fatal for Imperial (B) who were unlucky in a tough fi-nal, while Imperial (A) were impressive\nand won their division in 7:36.17. The\nLittleton Rosebowl was awarded to the\nfastest overall crew of the two divisions\nwhich Imperial lost out on to Cardiff\nUniversity/Swansea University by over\nImperial\u2019s women also deliver goods at the Met\nChristina Duffy four seconds.\nImperial (A) crew were in action\nagain on Sunday in the S2 category\ncompeting for the Matt Wood Bowl.\nThey finished third in the opening\nround proceeding to the repechage but\nwere unable to reach a top three position and didn\u2019t make the final.\nThe weekend\u2019s results are very promising and with several weeks remaining\nbeforeWRH,morespeedwillbegained\nin these boats.

    "content": "4 felix Friday 6 June 2008\nDying on the inside or living hell\nDepression is the most common mental health issue that students in UK universities suffer from, but it\u2019s\noften disregarded as a medical excuse. Sally Longstaff examines causes, symptoms and available treatments\nW\nhat life-threatening\ndisease do an\nestimated 121\nmillion people\nworldwide\ncurrently suffer from? At least one\nin five adults will suffer from it in\ntheir lifetime, and each year over two\nmillion cases are diagnosed in the UK.\nWomen are diagnosed as suffering\nfrom it twice as often as men. What is\nthis disease, often hidden away behind\nlayers of shame and casual attitudes\ntowards mental health? Depression.\nClinical Depression is a severe\npsychiatric illness that a person has\nfor anything from a few weeks to a few\nyears. It can arise for no reason at all,\nor it can be triggered by a very specific\nevent. Sometimes it can even be life-threatening.\nSymptoms vary from person to\nperson, and can be physical as well as\npsychological. The length of suffering\nvaries: it can occur once in a lifetime\nor there can be multiple recurrences;\nit can appear either gradually or\nsuddenly; and can either last for a few\nmonths or be a life-long disorder.\nOver the course of these two pages,\nwe will examine what depression\nactually is, look at its various\nmanifestations, how it can be treated,\nand how someone can get help if\nthey think they are a sufferer of this\nprevalent illness.\nWhat are the main causes of depression?\nT\nhere is no one cause of\ndepression and it varies\nfrom person to person.\nSometimes there are obvious causes for depression,\nsuch as bereavement, loss of a job or\nphysical illness, but often there are not.\nDepression does not affect everyone\nwho has these life events. Some people\nmay be more at risk of depression than\nothers, but given the right circum-stances, almost anyone may become\ndepressed. Often there is more than\none cause. The following factors can\ncause depression:\nChemical Deficiencies\nSymptoms of depression may be\ncaused by low levels of certain\nchemicals in the brain. Between the\nend of one nerve cell and the next\nthere is a small space called a syn-apse. The nerve cells communicate\nby releasing neurotransmitters into\nthe synapse, which then attach to\nthe other nerve cell and so pass on\nthe message. Three important neu-rotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin\nand noradrenaline are in short supply\nin depression sufferers. The low levels\nlead to faulty brain communication.\nHowever it is not known whether\nthis is a cause or an effect of depres-sion. Antidepressant drugs work\nby increasing the levels of these\nneurotransmitters.\nHormones\nThese may be important in\ncausing depression. Stress\nhormones may be linked to\ndepression as the condition\nis closely linked to stressful\nexperiences.\nWhen a sufferer undergoes a stressful event, a complex series of hormones are\nreleased which work together with\nadrenaline to cause a feeling of fright\nand anxiousness.\nIn most people, the hormone levels\nreturn to normal once the stressful\nsituation has passed but in depression the system is hyperactive. Cortisol\n(one of the hormones released) levels\ndon\u2019t follow the normal pattern. Usually, cortisol is released in large quantities in the morning and diminishing\namounts throughout the day. In depressed people its release is the same\nall day long.\nAgain, it\u2019s not known whether this is\na cause or an effect of depression.\nGenetics\nThere are many genes involved in depression and no one knows how exactly they work. There is no evidence of\nstraightforward inheritance for most\nforms of depression. So, for example,\nyou will not definitely develop depression because a family member has it,\nbut your risk will be increased.\nPersonality\nNo single personality type predisposes\npeople to depression. However, those\nwho are obsessional, dogmatic and\nrigid, and who hide their feelings or get\neasily anxious may be more at risk.\nFamily Environment\nLosing a parent in childhood, type of\nparenting, physical or sexual abuse in\nchildhood may all predispose someone\nto depression.\nStress and Life Events\nStress can lead to depression whether\nit comes in the form of sudden, overwhelming event or as long-term stress.\nDepression is six times more\ncommon in the six months\nafter a markedly stressful life\nevent.\nThe top ten stressful life\nevents are: death of a spouse,\ndivorce, marital separation, a\nprison term, death of a close\nfriend, injury or illness, mar-riage, losing a job, marital reconciliation and retirement.\nPsychological symptoms\nof depression\nLow Mood\nNot everyone who has depression\nfeels low. Some are anxious or\nemotionally numb, and some\nexperience a change in behaviour.\nLow mood is more than just\nfeeling disappointed or fed up.\nIt\u2019s a persistent feeling of sadness,\nemptiness, loss and dread. With\nsevere depression, low mood can\nsometimes be worse in the morning\nand get a bit better during the\nday. It can make it impossible to\nenjoy anything and nothing brings\npleasure. With mild depression,\nlow mood can be worse in the\nevenings and there may be good\ndays. Other people\u2019s company may\nbring pleasure although the sufferer\nmay feel low again when alone.\nLow mood often induces crying,\nsometimes at the slighted upset, or\nfor no reason at all.\nDepressive Thinking\nDepressive thinking has three\nelements: negative thinking e.g. \u201cI\nam a failure\u201d; high, unreasonable\nexpectations e.g. \u201cI cannot be\nhappy unless everyone likes me\u201d;\nand mistakes in thinking, such as\njumping to negative conclusions,\nfocussing on negatives, coming\nto conclusions on the bases of a\nsingle incident and blaming yourself\nfor things that are not your fault.\nThese negative thinking patterns\nundermine the sufferer, leading to\nworry, low confidence and feelings\nof worthlessness.\nAnxiety\nThe hormone, adrenaline, is release\nwhen we feel threatened, which\ndirects blood directed to muscles\nand the brain so that we can fight or\nflee. This makes us feel on edge and\ntense, but the feeling usually passes\nquickly if nothing happens. For a\ndepressed person, these feelings can\nlast for months, and dreading the\nday ahead can lead to waking up\nanxious.\nDelusions\nDuring severe depression, thinking can become so distorted that\nthe suffer loses touch with reality.\nA delusion is a false belief which is\nunshakable; for instance, that one\nhas divine powers, is a ghost, or can\nsee into the future.\nHallucinations\nThese involve perceiving things that\naren\u2019t real, usually sounds, such as\nvoices, but can include seeing or\nsmelling things that aren\u2019t there.\nConcentration and\nMemory Problems\nDepression can be all-consuming,\nand for some it can be difficult\nto think about things outside\ntheir illness. It can be difficult to\nconcentrate and so things can be\neasily forgotten.\nPhysical symptoms\nof depression\nSuicidal Impulses\nIn the depths of depression, the past\nlooks full of mistakes, the present\nis awful and the future is dreaded.\nThis leads some to conclude that\nlife isn\u2019t worth living. Many people\nwith depression think about suicide,\nbut most do not go through with\nit because of beliefs or the effect it\nwould have on their families.\nSleep Problems\nThese are common in depression\nand are sometimes to blame for\ntiredness that depressed people feel.\nSufferers may wake earlier and not\nbe able to sleep, or not able to drop\noff at night, due to anxiousness.\nSometimes it\u2019s a vicious circle: worrying about not sleeping may lead to\neven less sleep.\nMental and Physical\nSlowing\nSufferers may feel tired all the\ntime, it\u2019s hard to perform everyday\ntasks, everything in an effort and\nit can seem that things are slowed\ndown. Speech may be slow and\nmonotonous.\nSelf Harm\nSelf harm is deliberate injury\ninflicted by a person upon their\nown body. Self harmers are\ncommonly thought to be suicidal,\nbut more often than not, this\nis not the case. Motives for self\ninjury are often personal and seem\nincomprehensible to others. Those\nwho harm themselves often say that\nit allows them to disassociate with\ntheir feelings; the pain acts as a\nrelease. Alternatively, self-harm can\nbe a release from feeling numb.\nLoss of Appetite\nFood doesn\u2019t seems appetising. For\nsome hunger may even disappear.\n\n"

However, for most serious rowers, it is the peak of the racing season \u2013 the event for which the\npast nine months of training have been\nbuilding up to.\nIn essence, there is no other race\nquite like it. Unlike most other regat-tas, it is raced side-by-side and against\nthe stream. A week before the race it-self, a full-scale construction process\nis carried out to lay wooden booms in\nthe river along the length of the 2112m\ncourse, create various riverside enclosures and build a large grandstand at\nthe finish line. However, it is truly the\nunique atmosphere of the regatta that\nmakes it special; crews travel from as\nfar away as the US and Australia to experience racing at Henley. Unsullied\nby commercial interests, the regatta is,\nhowever, a truly British institution.\nRacing begins on Wednesday and\ncontinues until Sunday in a one-on-one \u2018knock-out\u2019 format, generally with\na race each day for each crew still in\ntheir event. The quality of racing in all\nevents is extremely high, and a Henley\nwin is highly prized. In the past four\nyears, Imperial College has dominated the \u2018Prince Albert Challenge Cup\u2019\nevent with two wins. As a result, Imperial was given the honour of naming\nthe event and the rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, donated the Cup last year on\nbehalf of the college, in the presence of\nHRH The Queen.\nThis year Imperial will be seeking wins at Henley Royal Regatta and\nWomen\u2019s Henley. Such feats will not be\neasily achieved; if they are, however, it\nwill boost Imperial\u2019s sporting reputation massively both in the UK and internationally and show it can compete\nwith the likes of Cambridge and Harvard outside of academia, as it already\ndoes inside. Women\u2019s Henley runs\nfrom Friday 20th June to Sunday 22nd\nJune, while Henley Royal Regatta begins on Wednesday 2nd July and ends\non Sunday 6th. For more information,\nvisit the regattas\u2019 websites at www.hwr.\norg.uk and www.hrr.co.uk.

The\nfollowing day, he moved into a potential GB lightweight quad, which also\nwon very convincingly. This should\nstand Adam in good stead for selection\nto represent his country once again in\nthe near future.\nIt should be stressed, however, that\nrowing at such a level is not all work\nand no play.

A man in a\nwhite suit struts across the stage. He\nsuddenly produces a giant plastic molecule and starts dancing suggestively.\nNo, this is not some weird nightclub -the show is actually the bizarre finale\nto a well respected Science Communication Conference.\nThe \u2018dancer\u2019 is Dr Graeme Jones, a\nchemical ecologist who enjoys engaging the public with science. This was\n\u2018Saturday night Science\u2019, an amusing\n\u2018scientific guide\u2019 to a great night out.\nJones explains how reaction dynamics\nexplain that \u2018boy meets girl moment\u2019:\nto speed up a reaction, you need heat,\npressure (lots of molecules in a small\nspace) and a catalyst (to lower the energy barrier). So to attract someone,\nyou\u2019ve got to be hot, go to a busy club\nand \u2026 dance. If you thought the catalyst should be booze, he reminds you\nthat a catalyst cannot be consumed by\nthe reaction. Jones was certainly a colourful way to finish the conference.\nThe conference is organised each\nyear by the BA (British Association\nfor the Advancement of Science). The\nBA is a charity that works to build a\npositive relationship between science\nand the rest of society. The BA organises other major initiatives such as the\nBA Festival of Science (this year to be\nheld in Liverpool, 6-11th September)\nand National Science and Engineering\nWeek (next year: 6-15th March.)\nThis year was the 7th annual BA\nconference, which was held at the Institution of Engineering and Technology, Savoy Place. Lord Melvyn Bragg,\nthe renowned broadcaster, writer and\nnovelist, gave the opening speech. The\nbasis of his talk was that science is central to British culture, but most people\nonly think of culture as the arts. Bragg\nbelieves that to help overcome this\nstereotype of culture it is vital that the\npublic can trust science.\nOnce the delegates had met each oth-er, through a \u2018structured networking\u2019\nevent based on speed dating (slightly\nfrustrating if you have to move on after\njust a brief exchange with Robert Winston!), there were a series of \u2018hands-on\u2019\nThe BA Science Communication conference\nKatrina Pavelin represented Imperial at this year's event. Here, she tells us what exactly this involved...\n'It is the most closely allied forms \u2013\nvarieties of the same species and species of the same and related genera\n\u2013 which, from having nearly the same\nstructure, constitution and habits, generally come into the severest competition with each other'.\nThis startling statement was made\nby Charles Darwin in 1859. Recent research has supported this view, revealing that close animal relatives shouldn't\nshare the same habitat \u2013 a wake-up call\nfor researchers modelling the effects of\nclimate change on biodiversity.\nIn1932,theRussianecologistGeorgii\nFrantsevich Gause, after observing\nsimilar species of bacteria competing\nfor the same resources in a test tube,\nfounded the competitive exclusion\nprinciple that states no two species\nwith similar ecological features can coexist indefinitely on the same limiting\nresource.\nToday, we know closely-related species of plants are able to thrive together,\nbut with animals it's a different story.\nScientists at Imperial College London\nhave discovered evidence supporting\nDarwin and Gauss \u2013 related animal\nspecies living in the same habitat have\nthe tendency to 'exterminate' one another if they live together.\nNatalie Cooper, a PhD student at Imperial College, is lead author of a new\nstudy published in the Proceedings of\nthe Royal Society on closely-related\nspecies of mammals. She discovered\nthat related mammals, such as tamarins and spider monkeys, do not tend\nto live in the same community for good\nreason \u2013 over-competition. \u201cMoving\ntogether isn't going to do them any\ngood, they're perfectly distributed as\nthey are, but once they get forced closer\ntogether that could cause problems.\u201d\nOne of the advantages Cooper and\nother researchers have compared to\nDarwin is that he was working with\ntaxonomies when predicting that\nanimals with the same genus names\nwould compete more strongly than\nthose with different names. Scientists\ntoday use phylogenies or evolutionary\ntrees that better reveal the dysfunctional relationships between closely-related animals.\nCooper discovered that squirrels and\npossums dispersed further apart from\none another over millions of years of\nevolution after comparing data from\nthe mammal 'super tree,' a big family tree of all mammal species in the\nworld.\n\u201cThere's a possibility that habitats are\ngoing to shrink in the way that rainforests are shrinking.\u201d In the wake of cli-workshops. These allowed delegates\nto share their ideas about a specific\nbranch of science communication\nand discuss contemporary issues. The\nworkshops ran in three strands: \u2018Engaging to Inspire and Educate\u2019, \u2018Engaging to Involve\u2019, and \u2018Engaging Through\nthe Media and Public Relations\u2019.\nThe PR workshops, which were\norganised by Stempra, an informal\nnetwork for science communicators,\nstarted with one looking at the respon-Brett Cherry\nAttendees got down to some solid networking after being subjected to suggestive dancing with molecules\nTo find out more, check out\nwww.the-ba.net/the-ba/\nScienceinSociety/index.htm\nsibilities of a press officer. Presenters\nincluded professional press officers,\nsuch as Steve Palmer from Cancer\nResearch UK, and science journalists\nsuch as the Daily Mail\u2019s Fiona McRae,\nwho provided useful advice about the\nbest way for press officers to work\nsuccessfully with journalists. Another\nworkshop encouraged delegates to\ndevise \u2018best-practice\u2019 guidelines to be\nlater developed by Stempra.\nThe conference aims to attract peo-mate change, this research could prove\nbeneficial to preserving biodiversity.\nClimate change models have often\njudged each species as independent\nfrom one another implying that close-ly-related animals can live together\nwithout causing loss of biodiversity.\n\u201cThey're not actually going to be able\nto do that,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cYou can lose\nmore biodiversity just by looking at\neach species as independent.\u201d\nIn order to address the impact of\nclimate change on animal popula-tions, the problem of related species\nof mammals living closer together over\ntime due to habitat destruction must\nbe included, otherwise \u201cwe're going to\nbe very confused when half the animal\nspecies go extinct because of interactions with other species, rather than\nthe indirect effect of climate change.\u201d\nSupport for Darwin's theory after scientists discover that closely-related species of mammals don't get on\nOld news: close relatives make bad neighbours\nple from different backgrounds. Each\nyear there are bursaries available that\ncover the full expenses of the conference \u2013 including travel and accommo-dation. This year there were 29 bursa-ries that were funded by the Wellcome\nTrust and the Department for Innovation, Universities & Skills.\n\u201cThe purpose of the bursary scheme\nis to ensure that certain groups of people attend the conference who wouldn\u2019t\nbe able to do so otherwise,\u201d explained\nNigel Eady, the Science in Society\nOfficer at the BA. The bursaries are\nawarded to scientists and engineers involved in public engagement, science\ncommunication students, freelancers,\nand campaign groups.\nOne bursary recipient, Maya Herbolzheimer, said \u201cI\u2019ve found this conference really helpful, especially as I\u2019m\nfairly new to the communications are-na. It\u2019s been really good to meet lots of\nnew people from different sectors.\u201d She\nis from Forum for the Future, a charity\ndedicated to sustainable development.\nThe bursary also covered the highlight of the conference: the three course\ndinner. This was a wonderful social\nevent, allowing delegates to \u2018network\u2019\nover wine and relax on the balcony,\nwith a stunning view of the Thames.\nThe conference was a great opportunity to meet people and learn more\nabout the role of science in society. It\nwould be equally useful for research\nscientists who want to enrich their\ncareers by engaging the public with\ntheir work. And what other conference would leave you dancing madly\nin the lecture theatre and waving glow\nsticks?\nThis mah nut \u2013 you go git your own. Squirrel Nutkin don't share with no-one. Certainly not with no possum\n\n"

Like fields and a festival atmosphere? Hate the general trek out to the middle of nowhere, the muddy fields\nand sleeping with three other drunkards in the same tent? Fear no more. Proving there\u2019s life beyond \u201cbig tunes\u201d, those cheeky\nchaps from Groove Armada have expanded their weekly club night into an all-out festival in Victoria Park in the heart of East\nLondon. As if you didn\u2019t already know.\nYes, I know East London is a whole hour away on public transport and a trip to WC2 qualifies as a \u201ctrek\u201d for most Imperialites, but an hour to music heaven and being back home in time for Match of the Day is still better than queuing for unspeakably abused portaloos and shelling out a six quid for a burger and chips. The lineup for the weekend is also expected to include\nGoldfrapp, The Flaming Lips, Human League, Jack Penate, Manu Chao, and The Glimmers will be manning the decks.\nSat 19th \u2013 Sun 20th July\nwww.lovebox.net\nMarleybone Summer Festival\nTired of kookiness? Sick of posers at festivals more interested in catching a glimpse of Sienna et al\nthan enjoying the music? Then perhaps Marylebone\u2019s annual summer festival will do the trick. An\nold-school affair and totally family/couple friendly, the festival sees the closure of the Marylebone\nHigh Street to traffic, allowing pedestrians to roam free in the otherwise chichi neighbourhood.\nStalls and food will be laid out, great music will abound and the air will ring with the sound of fairground rides. Think Marylebone with a dose of Portobello, or classic street parties with organic\nproduce \u2013 a pleasant day out assured.\nSun 15th June, 11am \u2013 5pm\nTube: Marylebone\nLondon Festival of Architecture\nThough summer is about chilling, the hardcore amongst you will no doubt be tramping the streets of our fair\ncity in search of cultural stimulation to compensate for the hours spent revising or working on projects. With\nthe city\u2019s theatres, bookstores and the London Lit Festival being popular targets to head for, consider the city\u2019s\narchitecture-fest that takes place this summer. A celebration and exploration of the city\u2019s buildings, streets and\nspaces - with over 600 exhibitions, lectures, public space installations, guided walks, bicycle rides, boat tours,\nparties, design workshops and debates. In other words, a multitude of ways to get stuck in and truly involved\n\u2013 stimulation indeed. Highlights include talks by high-profile architects, including 2007 Stirling Prize winner\nDavid Chipperfield and Daniel Libeskind. Alternatively, join speakers like Janet Street-Porter or Jon Snow for a\nfull English breakfast in an architecturally significant venue.\nFri 20th June \u2013 Sun 20th July\nwww.lfa2008.org\nBen and Jerry\u2019s Sundae Festival\nA delight. A lazy weekend of schmoozing around in the sun (hopefully), with movies, live mu-sic, movies on big shiny screens, unlimited ice cream and the happy sparkly utopian atmosphere that only a universally-adored brand like Ben and Jerry\u2019s can conjure up. All for a fiver.\nUnlimited ice cream for a fiver?\nYes indeed. All the ice cream you could ever eat (that\u2019s not a challenge) should be enough to\nconvince you to go. But if that isn\u2019t sufficient, the nostalgic vibes of Britrockers Ash and the\nanticipation of exploring Clapham\u2019s wealth of local eateries and drinking dens later on should\ndo it. So go for that gut-busting cardio workout beforehand, embark on that torrid lemon-juice diet if you have to and forgo the Colonel\u2019s special recipe for a month in advance \u2013 you\u2019re\ngoing to get fat.\nSat 26th \u2013 Sun 27th July\nwww.benjerry.co.uk/sundae\nKenwood House Concerts\nTucked away in pretty Hampstead, Kenwood House\u2019s series of concerts is perfect for those of you\nwho just want to chillax with a cold drink on a sunny day instead of sweltering the heat. Of a feminine disposition (i.e. female)? With the missus (i.e. whipped)? Then this may just be the ticket.\nThough it\u2019s a bit of a trek, it makes for an enticing day trip reachable by regular Oyster-worthy\nroutes, combining the charms of Hampstead, a gastropub or two, a leisurely stroll and an impressive\nconcert line-up. Highlights include Rufus Wainwright, Omara Portuondo of the Buena Vista Social\nClub, Van Morrison and Katherine Jenkins. For those of you more predisposed to self-harm, Diana\nKrall will be performing on the 9th of August.\nSat 26th June \u2013 Sat 23rd August\nTube: Archway, then 210 bus\nwww.picnicconcerts.com\nWritten by David Paw, concept by Rosie Grayburn\nThe Great Culture Crawl\nChapter Twelve \u2013 Summer festivals\nGet Loaded in the Park\nCome late August, Summer will still be in full swing. Courtesy of whatever major climactic event is the cause of Blighty\nin Autumn feeling more akin to the Gobi at the height of summer, we will crave the Zen-like calm of air-conditioned\nCaffe Neros, copious Mini Milks will be consumed and most of college will have pissed off home or be \u201chaving it large\u201d\nsomewhere conspicuously droll. Koh Samui is a popular choice or, say, Milton Keynes. You could feel sorry for the poor\nbastards left in the city over the summer, but alas, with massive summer festivals like the Wireless and Loaded in the Park,\nyou could argue about who would have the most fun.\nThe cheekier South London equivalent of Wireless, though it can\u2019t boast the latter\u2019s megawatt line-up, the organisers have\nstill pulled something special out. Rock, hip-hop, electronica and more will feature at the festival, which has booked The\nHives, Iggy and the Stooges, Kate Nash, Gogol Bordello, The Gossip, Utah Saints, The Holloways and uber-DJs like the\nPlump DJs, Soulwax, Mylo and DJ Yoda.\nSun 24th August\nwww.getloadedinthepark.com\nDANO Korea Summer Festival\nHow about something completely different? Many of us will be familiar with facets of east Asian culture \u2013 samurai\nfilms, anime and salmon sashimi in Japanese traditional and contemporary culture perhaps, or the New Year\u2019s\nevents or martial arts of China. However, in comparison, very few people are aware of their peninsular counterparts\u2019 sheer cultural diversity and depth. With a totally unique, traditional style of dress (the elaborate hanbok),\nmartial arts (the familiar tae kwon do) and music, there is much to be gleaned from Korean culture. Did we mention the cuisine? Blowing peppery hot and spicy with fiery stir-fries or sensuously savoury and clean like the best\nthat your favourite Japanese can muster, Korean eateries are popping up all over town with good reason.\nThis Sunday, Trafalgar Square will be transformed into a mini-Korea for the annual DANO celebrations. The festival provides a fascinating insight into the culture and customs of Korea featuring performances by Korean artists,\ncrafts and music workshops, Korean food and a parade. The event celebrates Seoul Day and the 60th anniversary\nof the establishment of the South Korean government.\nSunday 8th June\nwww.koreasummerfestival.org\n\n"

These\nlyrics certainly ring\na lot of truth for me\nright now. Exams and revision are taking their toll as I had feared. Do I even\nhave time to write about music, I ask\nmyself? This will be the last issue that\nI\u2019ll write for this academic year-a big\nfat tear rolls off onto the keyboard as I\ntype this. Well, no, not really. I\u2019m glad\nmy first year at uni has been relatively\nsmooth. Writing for Felix has been a\nchore at times but most of the time, I\u2019ve\ntruly loved being a Music Editor, albeit\nnot for very long, having only come on\nboard this year. Anyway, with regards\nto being sad that I\u2019m approaching the\ndemise of freshers year, I have to say, I\nam glad that I haven\u2019t perished or done\nsomething stupid/crazy. I don\u2019t get too\nemotional, but when I do, you\u2019d better\nstay well clear from me. This year is\ndrawing to a close, soon it will really be\nthe summer holidays. Can\u2019t wait! I\u2019m\nsimply dying to be free from having my\nnose stuck in gazillions of textbooks,\nscruffy, messed-up revision notes and\nwhat have you not.\nRecently, I ventured into the music\nrooms and allowed myself a glorious\nmoment of much craved-for peace, immersing myself in the absolutely soothing melodies of Chopin, Beethoven and\nother lovely classical piano compos-ers. To top it up, I played some jazzy/\nchilled out stuff by Norah Jones as well\nas contemporary indie/pop/rock songs\nby gems like Keane and Oasis. The piano really has healing powers...\nAside, has anyone bothered to watch\nthe Eurovision contest? I didn\u2019t bother\nbut I\u2019m sure some of you readers out\nthere may have felt obliged to lend\nyour eyes to cringing talentless musical wannabies trying to flaunt their\nstuff on TV. Is it any wonder that U.K.\ncame last again this year? Do we honestly care? At least it wasn\u2019t yet another\nhumongous zero-point total for us\nbut nevertheless as human beings, we\nseem to feel compelled to watch people\nmake total fools of themselves. Some\nhave said that Sir Terry Wogan is the\nsole reason that they bother watching\nthis silly song competition because he\nalways gives witty commentaries when\nintroducing the various singers and\ntheir country\u2019s background, purposefully livening up the dreadful singing\nand awful dance moves on stage. For\nthose of you \u2018keen\u2019 on finding out who\nswept to victory, I\u2019ll tell you that it is the\nhunky Russian, the one and only Dima\nBilan who sang \u2018Believe.\u2019 Thought so.\nThe name rings no bells and will never\nring a bell; neither now nor in the distant future, but apparently he is huge\nin Russia. You see, some countries do\nsupport, even love and adore, their acts\neven if we don\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter one\nbit at the end of the day, however, as\nwe\u2019ve got plenty of musical fish in the\nsea here...\nIf you fancy reviewing some\nmusic or gigs, send us an email\nat music.felix@imperial.ac.uk and\nget yourself on the mailing list.\nOne Night Only in action... lead vocalist George with Mark, the guitarist in the zone\nO\nne Night Only are an\nindie/rock/pop band\ncomprised of five\nHemsley, North Yorkshire laddies in their\nlate teens/ early twenties. They formed\nback in 2003 and have had recent success with their singles \u2018You and Me\u2019\n\u2018Just for Tonight,\n\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s About Time.\n\u2019\nMusic Felix had the pleasure of talking\nto Sam, the drummer and Jack the keyboardist from the band.\nYou guys grew up in Yorkshire,\nhas that shaped your music in\nany way?\nJ: I guess it just means that we are not\npart of any city related scene, i.e., the\nArctic Monkeys are from Sheffield,\nMaximo Park are from Newcastle\netc...\nS: It has allowed us to create our own\nstyle of music, we are not really influenced by any local bands or what seems\nto be cool at the time, so I think it has\naffected the way we sound.\nHow did you guys get into music?\nS: I got into music by listening to it. I\u2019ve\nalways had music there around in the\nhouse. My parents are very big on listening to music.\nWere you self-taught or did you\nhave lessons?\nJ: I am a classically trained pianist. I\u2019ve\nbeen taught for years.\nS: For me, I was self taught for 2 years,\nhad lessons for 2 years, loose and informal ones, then I\u2018ve been self taught\nsince then.\nWho is your favourite classical\ncomposer?\nJ: It has to be Grieg.\nWhat is your opinion on the Indierock genre? In the past 5 years,\nthe music industry has been\nflooded by so many bands that\ncome under this type of music.\nSurely as listeners we have heard\nenough of it?\nS: I think it is too easy to pigeon-hole\nsomeone as Indie-rock. If you look\nat all the Indie bands, there\u2019s a lot of\nvariation within them, like the Arctic\nMonkeys, they are very different from\nus. There is enough differences between the bands to not get bored of listening to them. Plus, Indie-rock does\nkind of change with time so they don\u2019t\nall sound the same.\nJ: The brilliant thing about having\nso many live bands around has made\nmusic so much more prominent. Live\nmusic is the main sort of thing at the\nmoment.\nS: People go to gigs more than they buy\nrecords these days.\nWho writes the songs in the\nband?\nS: Everyone.\nDoesn\u2019t that generate a lot of\nclashes between people, everyone having various ideas and so\non?\nS: Yes, but I think that is what brings\nout the best in people. If you\u2019ve got five\ndifferent musical inputs, five different minds working on the same idea,\neventually you are going to get a better\nsound out of it.\nHow do you determine when a\nsong is complete?\nJ: When we stop disagreeing.\nHow long did it take for you to\nstart and finish your album?\nS: We wrote the collection of songs\nover two years. Recording-wise, I think\nit took us about four months, two or\nthree month blocks of recording.\nHow does it feel to be in a band?\nJ: The best thing is we are doing a job\nwith our best mates.\nS: I don\u2019t like doing anything by\nmyself.\nJ: Neither do I. Can\u2019t stand it.\nEven going to the loo?\nS: I go to the toilet with Mark. We do\nget compared to girls a lot, only with\nthe toilet thing.\nJ: It\u2019s the tight jeans and the long hair.\nDo you have a favourite venue\nout of all the places you\u2019ve played\nat?\nS: Dundee. Hot Sams. It\u2019s a good venue.\nThe building is insane. It\u2019s got three gig\nvenues in this same place.\nJ: I had a dream that there was a spa\nthere, behind this mirror because\nwe\u2019ve been there once and I knew we\nwere going to go back there.\nS: I think we\u2019ve been there three times\nand every-time we go there, we find\nsomething that we didn\u2019t know was\nthere before. The first time we went\nthere, we had ages before the sound-checks, so we played hide and seek.\nIt must have been an hour and a half,\nrunning around this place.\nJ: Mark disappeared. He was good at\nhide and seek, he must have found a\ncorner and curled up there.\nS: No, I think he left the building.\nDo you get bored of playing the\nsame tracks, listening to the\nsame tunes over and over can get\ntedious?\nJ: It\u2019s not the same as listening to other\npeople\u2019s music when you play your\nown music, because having created it\nourselves, every time I play the songs, I\nremember different things about when\nwe wrote it. People say, do you ever listen to your own music, well; of course,\nI have it on my iPod. It is the best thing\nwe\u2019ve ever made, two years of hard\nwork has been put in it.\nHow was it to support The Pigeon\nDetectives and The Enemy?\nJ: Wicked. The Pigeons more so because we got to spend a longer time\nwith them, we got to know them very\nwell.\nS: We only did five shows with the Enemy. The Pigeons are really nice guys.\nIs there any rivalry between you\nand other bands?\nJ: We don\u2019t make enemies, we are from\nthe North and we make friends with\neveryone.\nSince you\u2019ve been in the music\nbusiness, have you learnt any\ntricks of the trade, how to face\nthe media etc..?\nS: Be natural.\nJ: And don\u2019t bitch about other people\nbecause they will publish it straight\noff.\nIt has been said that David Bowie,\nBob Dylan and the Cure have\nSusan Yu chats up some of Yorkshire\u2019s finest, but it\u2019s strictly for One Night Only...\nOne Night Only\u2019s second album is due out in a year\u2019s time\n\n"

If my social life, or\nmy life in general, hadn\u2019t been\nraped by revision, you lot would have\ngot Felix Fashion pages for the last\nthree weeks. For their absence, I can\nonly apologise and I trust you didn\u2019t\ncry yourselves to sleep each time you\nrealised you couldn\u2019t get your fix of Felix Fashion that week. If you remember\ntwo weeks ago, Felix Fashion exhibited\nsome \u2018fashionable Imperialites\u2019. If you\nwere one of the lucky people featured,\nI hope you\u2019re pleased with the pictures\nwe chose for you, because after all we\ndidn\u2019t (not that we could with our fa-cilities!) airbrush or tweak anything\nlike they do in most publications. We\nwant to show you lot in all your natural\nglory! It was funny to see my friends\nstarting to get insecure when they realised I hadn\u2019t asked them to feature in\nthe spread.\nSince I\u2019ve never really had a chance to\nintroduce myself, now seems as good a\ntime as ever. With the intellect that got\nyou into Imperial, you\u2019ve probably figured out I\u2019m Dan. Despite my surname\nand shared interest in fashion, no, I\nam not related to Gok Wan, and hence\ndon\u2019t take pleasure out of undressing\nunshapely women.\nAs Fashion Editor, I\u2019ll be taking Felix\nFashion beyond this term into the new\nacademic year (2008-09) at Imperial.\nThis is also an opportunity to thank\nSarah for the years of Felix Fashion\nshe\u2019s edited. Without doubt, she\u2019s set\na precedent for me and future Fashion Editors for Felix; one I\u2019m going\nto have to do a lot of work to match,\nand hopefully beat. I\u2019m looking out for\nsome Fashion writers for this term and\nespecially next year. I know this might\nbe a bit far-fetched, but if there are any\nbudding fashion journalists out there\nat Imperial, thrust your writing hand\nforward and write for Felix Fashion!\nOn the contrary, some of the best articles that I\u2019ve come across have been\nfrom those that do not have a great\npassion for fashion but those that just\nhave something they want to bitch\nabout or praise in a one-off article.\nIf you don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good\nenough writer, truth be told, you\u2019re\nprobably better than most, especially\nat an all-science university!

You\nknow you want to.\nLastly, but in no way least, the news\nthat the iconic designer Yves SaintLaurent passed away in Paris on Sunday, 1st of June. A name synonymous\nwith elegance and beauty, Saint Laurent built up a fashion empire under\nhis own name. In this brand, his undisputed creative genius will forever be\nremembered in the clothes generations\npast, present, and future, admired and\nworn. Personally, I was born a decade\ntoo late to even experience Saint Laurent\u2019s ever-dwindling years as an active\nhaute couture designer however what\nI write about here every week would\ntake a very different shape without\nYves Saint Laurent.

He also\npioneered the beatnik look, turning\nits former deadbeat associations into a\nhigh-end fashion trend. He also managed to introduce capes, blazers and\nthe \u2018turtle neck\u2019 to the runway.\nEven before his death, tributes to\nSaint Laurent\u2019s undeniable talent were\nin no short supply.

    "content": "Felix has uncovered data suggesting\nthat mental health receives less attention and fewer resources at Imperial\nthan nationally. Also discovered was\nthat Imperial students suffer proportionally far more from academic stress\nthan comparable institutions (ie: \u2018Old\nUniversities\u2019 comprising of the Russell\nGroup and a few others).\nThis week, Felix obtained the latest\nstudent mental health statistics from\nthe Imperial College Student Counselling Service (SCS), coinciding with\na special feature examining student\ndepression. The Counselling Service\u2019s\nannual report documents data from\nthe previous academic year (2006-07)\nand indicates a continuing increase in\nthe general upward trend in referrals\nto the service over the last nine years,\nbut exhibits a massive disparity with\nnational data obtained by Felix.\nFelix also spoke to students with experience of the Counselling Service,\nmainly being referred as individuals\nsuffering from depression. Their opinions of mental health at Imperial have\nbeen mixed, with some highly critical\ncomments of the Counselling Service.\nThe last year showed a 10.5% increase\nin the number of students contacting the SCS compared to the previous\nyear. This figure is almost double the\nincrease in the number of students at\nImperial year-on-year, suggesting that\na rising proportion of IC students are\nrequiring some form of Counselling\nfor mental health issues. This increase\nis either due to increasing awareness\nof the College\u2019s counselling services or\nthat more students are encountering\ndifficulties during their studies. Not\nonly are more students in need of the\nservice, they are requiring more sessions to combat their issues with an\nincrease of 16% in the number of one-to-one Counselling sessions between\n2006 and 2007.\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n3\nFriday 6 June 2008 felix\nNews\nMental health at IC: Who cares?\nImperial\u2019s Student Counselling Service found wanting when compared with national student figures\nTom Roberts\n& Andrew Somerville\nMiners offend the Cornish\nJovan Nedi\u0107\nIncoming Editor-in-Chief\nImperial getting set for\nuniversity entrance exams\nImperial College Rector, Sir Richard\nSykes, has criticised state schools for\nfailing their students and voiced concerns that it is extremely difficult to\ndifferentiate university applicants using their A-Level grades. He also laid\nout plans for an entrance exam for applicants to Imperial.\nAn entrance exam for subjects other\nthan medicine, which already employs\nthe BMAT (BioMedical Admissions\nTest), will begin in 2010 and could set\nthe model for entrance exams around\nthe country. The Rector said at the Independent Schools Council\u2019s annual\nconference that nearly all applicants to\nImperial had 4 or 5 A-Levels and \u201cEven\nif you interview all the students you still\nhave a problem [selecting the best].\u201d He\nwent on to defend A-Levels but emphasised that due to \u201cgrade inflation\u201d it\nwas impossible to use A-Levels as the\nmain discriminatory factor.\nThe entrance exam will not replace\nA-Levels but serve as an added discriminatory factor when making offers\nto applicants. While new entrance exams will be developed for most undergraduate courses, Biomedical science\nstudents will take the already established BMAT\nHe also made wider comments on\nthe state of education in the UK, saying\nit was \u201cfrightening\u201d that 40% of Imperial undergraduates came from the 7%\nof the student population that attended private institutions. He claimed that\nsomething radical was needed to save\nthe 93% who are state schooled and\nwere \u201cnot getting the education that\nthey deserve\u201d. The rector further slated\nstate schools by stating: \u201cWe have in\nthis country some of the best secondary education in the world but only a\nfew percentage of people benefiting\nfrom it,\u201d and suggesting that bright\nchildren should be \u201csaved\u201d by removing them from state schools and giving\nthem a private school education with\ngovernment funding.\nHowever one might take the Rector\u2019s apparent sudden concern for the\neducation of state school pupils with a\npinch of salt, given his previous calls to\nraise the cap on tuition fees.\nThe Royal School of Mines (RSM) have\nmanaged to cause controversy, and\nbring the national media\u2019s spotlight\nonto Imperial College Union (ICU),\nover a comment made on their hockey\nclub\u2019s website. The offending comment\ndirected at the Camborne School of\nMines (CSM) read:\n\u201cThe Royal School of Mines Hockey\nClub follows in a long line of RSM\nsporting prowess but most of all its\nabout fun, drinking and beating the\npulp out of little Cornish inbreds who\nlike to call themselves miners\u201d.\nA Cornish Councillor, namely Graeme Hicks, found this remark highly offensive and discriminatory to Cornish\npeople and demanded that the statement be removed with a formal apology to be issued by ICU. Subsequently,\nUnion President, Stephen Brown, had\nthe statement changed. The word \u201cCornish\u201d was replaced with \u201cThe Cambourne School of Mines\u201d as he felt this\nwould \u201callow students of the RSM to\ncontinue to insult their rivals at CSM.\u201d\nThis was still not enough for the\ncouncillor. \u201cI was horrified to see this,\u201d\nCllr Hicks told Western Morning\nNews. \u201cYou expect idiots to say these\nthings but this was on a student union website linked to Imperial College\nLondon \u2013 I think it\u2019s absolutely dis-graceful. If you said that about a black\nperson you would be in court.\u201d\nThe BBC news website picked up on\nthe story too, and since then, the entire\nsentence has been removed from the\nUnion\u2019s website. Formal apologies have\nalso been sent to Cllr Hicks from both\nStephen Brown and Pro Rector, Prof\nBuckingham.\nMany students have dismissed the\nentire affair as friendly rivalry between\ntwo institutions, with David Laverty,\nCSM President, in agreement. \u201cIt\u2019s just\nbanter, it\u2019s the same year in, year out.\nIt rolls off your back. I\u2019m not an inbred\nand the Cornish are not inbreds.\u201d\nSome Imperial students have taken\ngreat offence to Cllr Hicks attitude,\nwho believe he has publicly offended a\nlarge cohort of IC students by tarring\nthem all with the same brush.\nRumours that Stephen Brown is\nquaking in his boots after some Western Morning News readers called for\nhim to be sacked, are a little hazy.\nKids, Cornish people do not look like Jupiter from The Hills Have Eyes\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy & Politics Editor\n18% \u2013 Depression & Mood Change\n15% \u2013\nAnxiety\n19% \u2013 Academic\n12% \u2013 Loss/\nBereavement\n16% \u2013 Relationships\n4% \u2013 Abuse\n4% \u2013 Transitions\n4% \u2013 Self\n& Identity\nUndergraduates are statistically underrepresented in the statistics, with\nonly 55% of SCS users being under-grads, whilst they make up 64% of the\nCollege as a whole. In comparison PhD\nstudents make most use of the service:\n25% of the total, whilst only 19% of\ncampus.\nOverall, 2.1% of students at Imperial\nrequired counselling in 2006-07.\nFelix compared this data to national\nfigures compiled by the Association\nfor University and College Counselling (AUCC). Most of the institutions\nthat supplied their counselling service\u2019s\ndata to the AUCC had similar populations to Imperial, with IC\u2019s 12,129 students being extremely close to the average of 12,500. However, Imperial\u2019s SCS\nstatistics are strikingly lower than the\nnational averages. A massive 44% fewer\nstudents use the SCS than the national\naverage of 436 cases every year. Imperial\u2019s service records 55% fewer individual sessions, and the SCS\u2019 2.6 Full-time\nEquivalent staff is more than an entire\nstaff member less than the national average of 3.7 full-time counsellors.\nThere are two striking differences\nbetween the national and Imperial\nstatistics.\nFirstly, when the reasons for counselling are compared between Imperial\nand \u2018Old Universities,\u2019 the most common issues at IC are depression and\nacademic stress. Elsewhere depression\nremains dominant whilst academic\nstress is in fourth place (out of sixteen),\naveraging 29% fewer cases than Imperial. One PhD student told Felix that\n\u201cthis is obviously a bad thing, but it\ndoesn\u2019t surprise me as students are under a great deal of stress here.\u201d\nSecondly, when the total percentage of students requiring counselling\nis compared: an average of 3.5% need\ncounselling across the UK, whilst only\n2.1% of IC students receive counselling\naccording the latest report. The reason\nfor this disparity is unclear, but appears\nto boil down to three possible explana-tions: Imperial students are less prone\nto mental health issues; Imperial students are not getting the help they\nneed; or Imperial students are seeking\nhelp outside of the university.\nFelix interviewed three depression\nsufferers whose opinions of Imperial\u2019s SCS varied. \u201cDue to their limited resources, I was told that students\ncouldn\u2019t really use [the SCS] as a long\nterm therapy,\u201d said Anna. \u201cThere was\nnot the time to build up the therapeutic relationship that I needed to really\nopenupandprogress\u2026butIamthankful that they saw me for as long as they\ncould.\u201d The comments were echoed by\nSCS\u2019 Senior Counsellor, David Allman,\nwho admitted that their resources were\nlimited and that they would like to increase them, \u201cbut ultimately it depends\non College\u2019s decision.\u201d\nKate, a less impressed user of the\nSCS, told Felix: \u201cCollege\u2019s counselling\nservice isn\u2019t very helpful to those who\nactually need their help. I guess it looks\ngood on paper to have such a service\nthough.\u201d She went on to compare Imperial to other institutions around the\ncountry: \u201cA friend at another uni received regular support from the counselling service for the duration of their\nstudies. I wish Imperial could have\ndone the same for me when I asked\nthem to.\u201d\nTurn over for Felix\u2019s special\nfeature examining depression\nThe percentage breakdown of issues presented to Imperial College\u2019s Student Counselling Service (SCS) during the 2006-07 academic year.\nDepression dominates counselling services nationally, however, IC has 29% more cases of academic stress compared to other UK institutions\nDATA\nPROVIDED\nBY\nSTUDENT\nCOUNSELLING\nSERVICE\n\n"

See next week\u2019s Felix for a\ncomprehensive collection of opinions from members of both teams, then cast your vote in the referendum\nI\n\u2019m not a political hack. In fact I\neven haven\u2019t decided where my\npolitical views lie yet! But I am\nSO annoyed that 24 people in a\nroom have voted to spring this\nreferendum on us right in the middle\nof exams, without even getting the\nrequired numbers to sign the referendum petition.\nI mean doesn\u2019t democracy mean\nanything more? The British people are\nnot happy with the EU constitution, so\nwhat does the Government do? They\nratify the Lisbon Treaty. Nobody wanted the war, and what does the government do? They threaten Iran. I am just\nSO tired of being told that our elected\nleaders know better than us!\nThe whole issue boils down to this\n\u2013 at the NUS Annual Conference in\nApril, the proposed changes to NUS\ngovernance, aimed at giving the union\na more democratic structure, which is\n\u201cagile, cheaper, and more accessible\u201d\ndid not go through. Imperial Union\nwas one of the main backers, and had\nin fact mandated all of its delegates to\nsupport the Governance Review. Understandably, Imperial Union was not\nhappy with the result but perhaps less\nunderstandably, now want to take the\nrash decision to leave the NUS. That\u2019ll\nteach them to mess with our Imperial\ndemands!\nWhat I ask you, dear readers, is to\nconsider whether this is in Imperial\u2019s\nbest interest. Both the previous and\ncurrent presidents were in favour of\nthe Governance Review and a revised\nform is being put together. The reforms fell by only 25 votes, with almost\ntwo thirds supporting it. The argument for NUS reform has been won,\neven if this vote wasn\u2019t. In all likelihood the reforms will be passed before\nChristmas.\nEven so, the NUS has already come\na long way over the last year: by making the tough decisions to streamline\nprocesses and cut back on staffing the\nNUS slashed affiliation fees by 10 percent overnight. In the year since we\u2019ve\njoined, the NUS has won major victories for students, not least engineering\nthe back down of HSBC over its student overdraft charges. Since joining,\nour sabbaticals have attended NUS\u2019\nsummer training programme, and\nNUS provided tailored and specific\ntraining to our college committees and\nwelfare volunteers. Next year ICU will\nhave to register as a charity, and NUS is\ngetting the legal advice on how best to\ndo this\u2013 clubbing together for this support is far cheaper than us paying for it\non our own. And lastly, as we go into\nthe review of top up fees next year we\u2019ll\nneed a national voice like never before\nto make ourselves heard.\nI\u2019m not trying to pretend that the\nNUS is problem-free. It\u2019s just that the\nbiggest problem with the NUS is well,\nUS. Yes us. But if the NUS didn\u2019t ex-ist, we\u2019d have to invent it. You have the\nbiggest student organisation in Europe,\ndiscussing, researching and campaigning on issues that affect students. We\nhave the brains and the drive to actually get things done. Yes the various factions within the NUS each have their\nagenda, so sometimes it takes time\nto come to a consensus, but hey welcome to the adult world! You discuss,\nyou compromise, you don\u2019t throw your\ntoys out of the pram and sulk.\nImperial College was one of the\nfounding members of the NUS in\n1922. We left in 1923 citing irreconcilable differences. We joined in 2006\nagain after 27 years, and are planning\nto leave after a year. We\u2019re Imperial, we\nthink we don\u2019t need the NUS, because\nwe think everybody knows us and will\nlisten to our views. Get real. This time,\nlet\u2019s keep our cool, keep our voice and\nremain affiliated to the NUS.\nKeep your cool and our voice\nSoumaya Mauthoor\n\u2018Yes\u2019 campaign leader\nI\ncampaigned for Imperial College Union (ICU) to join the\nNUS back in November 2006\nand whilst I think it was worth\ngiving them a chance I can now\nsafely say that they have now proved\nthemselves no longer worthy of the\ntrust I put in them.\nWe were promised an effective NUS\nthat was going to change and that we\ncould play a leading role in driving that\nchange. Instead we have seen their (and\nour) attempts to change stifled by extremists who would rather that the organisation continued to be their own\nplay park funded by Unions like ours\nwhohavecountlessactivitiesthatarefar\nmore worthy of the best part of \u00a350,000\nper annum that we pay to NUS.\nIf you are not aware, ICU has a controversial history with the NUS as the\norganisation has never provided any\ntangible benefits to the student body.\nFunnily enough, we were a founding\nmember in 1922, disaffiliated in 1923\nand then did not re-affiliate until 1939.\nIn 1940 ICU left in protest at the NUS\u2019\nstance against conscription for WWII.\nDuring the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s we dipped\nin and out of membership, leaving in\n1977 and then finally rejoining in November 2006. This information is just\nAnti-NUS\ncampaigner\nPro-NUS\ncampaigner\nEmancipate Imperial\nto illustrate that students at Imperial\nhave always had severe reservations\nabout the NUS who have for decades\nrefused to listen. I thought that after all\nthis time it was worth us giving NUS\nmembership another go but this historical evidence does suggest that the\norganisation is condemned to being\ninstitutionally useless.\nIn this referendum there is no debate\nabout how much of a mess this organisation is as the threat of financial decline has forced them to come clean.\nThis year we have heard all about\nhow the NUS has suffered from financial mismanagement, disengagement\nfrom the issues that are relevant to students and how they are not respected\nas the \u201cnational voice\u201d that they claim\nthemselves to be. NUS will tell you that\nthey are hugely influential yet this is the\nsame \u201cnational voice\u201d that is dismissed\nin parliamentary committees as being\nonly representative of student activists\nand not ordinary students.\nI urge you to vote No! as I believe it\nis crucial that we emancipate Imperial\nstudents from this organisation whose\nown leaders openly admit has been\nshockingly mismanaged, politically irrelevant and inaccessible to all but the\nmost hardened political activists. The\nmoney that is spent on NUS affiliation\ncould be far better spent by students at\nImperial rather than throwing it down\nthe NUS budgetary drainpipe. We were\npromised a cheaper, radically different\nNUS by April 2008 and it has not mate-rialised. I believe it would be irresponsible for us to take that gamble with\n\u00a346,000 of our money that could be\nfar more effectively spent on academic\nrepresentation and student activities\nfor students at Imperial. Why continue\nwasting our cash on a \u201cnational voice\u201d\nthat consistently fails to reflect the fact\nthat the UK education sector is hugely\ndiverse with different types of institutions pursuing different objectives? By\ndisaffiliating we would not be subsidis-ing this debating club for students who\nhave political aspirations but do very\nlittle to further the cause of student\nsupport and development on campus.\nDuring the course of this referendum\nyou will hear a variety of sob stories\nabout how the NUS is really going to\nchange next year. Well, we\u2019ve head it all\nbefore. Vote No! if you are not willing\nto take that gamble.\nKirsty Patterson\n\u2018No\u2019 campaign leader\nLast August, the NUS helped force HSBC to rethink its plans to charge\ngraduates 9.9% on their overdrafts when they finished their degree\nIs ICU\u2019s approximately \u00a350,000 NUS affiliation fee worth it?\n\n"

Both sides claim the rights to\nthe land, which contains some billions of dollars worth of oil, but neither is\nseems willing to de-escalate the situation. US and UN envoys to the region\nfear that another deadly crisis may break out in a country already having\nto deal with millions of displaced people. Although spokesmen for both\nparties claim their intentions are peaceful, external negotiators are not\noptimistic, believing that both sides are in fact keen for hostilities to begin.\nBurma Aid\nBurma\nLatest UN figures indicate that there are still over 3 million\nBurmese still in need of emergency care, with almost a third\nof them not having received foreign aid in any form. These\nproblems stem principally from the Burmese government\u2019s\ncontinuing refusal to grant access to relief workers, despite\nofficial assurances given to the UN. The military junta has\npersistently rebuffed French, British and American efforts,\nforbidding access and limiting the role they play in the\nemergency operations. As a result, large numbers of aid ships\nare returning home, frustrated at being unable to help.\nNuclear Probe\nSyria\nThe Syrian government has recently granted permission\nfor IAEA inspectors to enter the country and search for\ntheir alleged nuclear weapons programme. The decision to\nallow external inspectors comes months after US released\nintelligence stated that a Syrian nuclear site was \u2018not\nintended for peaceful purposes\u2019, pointing out its similarity\nto the Iranian nuclear facilities. Syria has persistently\ndenied all such accusations, dismissing them as \u2018ridiculous\u2019,\nalthough it has indicated its intention to collaborate fully\nwith the IAEA team.\nPakistan Explosion\nIslamabad\nDanish intelligence has linked Al Qaeda to last week\u2019s\ncar-bomb explosion outside their embassy in Islamabad.\nThough no group had claimed responsibility at the time\nof the Danish announcement, a web posting supposedly\nmade by Al Qaeda has since taken the credit.The blast,\nwhich killed 6 and left 24 people injured, is widely\nbelieved to be yet another response to the Danish PostJyllands prophet controversy. Security measures are being\nreinforced around all other embassies in Islamabad, and\nthe Danish representation has temporarily closed.\nDesigned by Gilead Amit & Kadhim Shubber\n\n"
