For many,\nImperial\u2019s way of approaching\nscores is unprecedented and gratifying\u2014unlike universities such as the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley,\nwhere there is a horrifying fixed \u201cgrade\nratio\u201d that successfully changes some\nstudents\u2019 lives into hell, scores in Imperial are determined not by the ranking,\nand everyone is possible to get the\nfirst-class degree. It means that, from\nnow on, we can study in our own way,\npursuing our own academic interests,\nand be ourselves instead of being forced\nto compete and regard friends as potential \u201crivals\u201d. However, privately, I do\nhear some complaints. \u201cHow can they\nknow I\u2019m not only good but excellent if\nI\u2019m without a ranking?\u201d Typically, for\nstudents used to the glory of \u201cNo.1 in\nclass\u201d, this could be a big problem. Back\nthen, it was easy for every student (in-cluding the No.1) to say who is the best\nin one classroom thanks to the ranking.\nBut now, well, things have changed. You\nmight never know who studies better,\nthe one drunk in the bar every night or\nthe one who sleeps in the library.\nThebanonrankingputsstudentshoping to achieve a high academic standard\nsomehow at a disadvantage. The difference between your extreme hard work\nand your peer\u2019s relatively relaxed schedule may not reflect on the scores, and the\nfeeling of your academic superiority may\nno longer exist. When assessed by external sources, say a company or a graduate\nschool admission team, those students\u2019\nacademicexcellencemayalsonotbevery\ndistinguishable. As a result, this ban can\npotentially run the risk of discouraging\nstudents to work hard to become \u201cphenomenal achievers\u201d and lower the quality of the university\u2019s graduates.\nOn the other side, the ranking system\nis indeed a massive stimulus to students\u2019\nacademic performance. This is evident\nin the results of the 2018 Programme\nfor International Student Assessment\n(PISA) (the PISA is one of the world\u2019s\nlargest cross-national tests for read-ing, math, science and other key skills)\nwhich placed countries, such as South\nKorea and China (only Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang participated)\nwhere students face enormous study\npressure and competition, ahead of\nhighly developed countries like Sweden,\nNorway, USA, and the UK. In many\nAsiancountrieswheretheso-called\u201chelicopter parents\u201d predominate, students\narerequiredtoachieveacertainranking,\nsay top 5% in a grade of 360 students, in\norder to convince their parents that they\nare doing well in their studies. Having a\ngood score is simply far from enough.\nItmaywellpromptpeopletoadvocate\nfor countries worldwide to adopt the socalled\u201cexam-oriented\u201deducationsystem\nto level up academic performance. However, they ignore the downsides underlying the benefits. To approach this issue,\nwe need to answer the question: what\u2019s\nthe purpose of education? And why do\nyou choose to have the education?\nHigh scores are required for many\nthings\u2014good high schools, good uni-versities, well-paid jobs, a prosperous\nfuture, and may even contribute to a future happy family. The score can reflect\nabilities in the academic field, mental\nagility,andmanymorethings,butitfails\ntodemonstratepeople\u2019sinterestandpassion both in academic fields and beyond.\nTrue greatness is not always reflected in\nscores,anditholdstruethatapersonhas\ntalents in some fields but not in others.\nChurchill, for example, failed to do well\nin school exams. Suppose that his talents\nin literature and military were not recognised simply because he couldn\u2019t pass\nthe school exams, Britain would probably have lost one of the most prominent\nprime ministers in history.\nThe ranking is something like a dollar\nsign stuck to the back of every student.\nTheoretically, the ranking only reflects\nthe score. But in the perception of many\nteachers, parents, and students, it equals\nthe value of students themselves. Who\nis the best in class? Who is better than\nwho? With the ranking system, everyone has the answer. It hugely impacts\nstudents\u2019 self-awareness and potentially\ncauses talents to be abandoned in pursuit of scores.\nBut still, isn\u2019t it that the ranking system can steer up the competition, which\ninturnhelpstheacademicperformance?\nThe problem does not come from the\nranking system itself, but what the ranking system is based on\u2014score. Score is\na good way to demonstrate ability, but\nit\u2019s not the aim of studying. However,\nfor students aiming at high ranks, their\npursuits can gradually be narrowed only\nto the improvement of scores instead of\ntheir life-long goals or academic break-throughs.Afewdaysago,oneofmyhigh\nschool friends from a prominent Chinese university, where all the students\u2019\nrankings in each exam are publicised\n(with only some degree of anonymity),\ntold me a similar story. All the students\nin the university are selected from the\ntop students at each high school, and\neveryone thought that they should continue to be at the top. But as you might\nhave expected, there came huge disappointment after the first exam. Then,\nwhat some students did after the exam\nwas to study much harder to beat other students. Of course, their supposed\n\u201copponents\u201d did the same in turn. Each\nstudent wanted to be better than the\nrest, and as a result, everybody started to\ndevote all their time in the library, reading textbooks and doing previous examination papers. The professor was quite\nuncomfortable in the next exam because\neveryone\u2019s score seemed good, and there\nwas not much difference between them.\nHowever, according to the university\u2019s\nrule, students should be rated according\nto their ranking. Therefore, in the third\nexam, what greeted students were significantly harder problems than the previous exam. And this cycle started all over\nagain.\nWhen everything is about competi-tion, who cares about the original purpose of studying?\nIt seems that Imperial is on the right\ntrack to not publicise rankings. However, there are things to keep in mind.\nApart from scores, there should be more\nawards, scholarships, research and internship opportunities to satisfy the\nstudents aiming to become phenomenal achievers. Complaints arise because\nthese opportunities are still greatly lim-ited. And this system also requires professors to cautiously balance the coursework and students\u2019 spare time to ensure\nproper study pressure is assigned to each\nstudent.\nThere is no dollar sign on a piece of\nmind. But the value of people varies.\nRegardless of which education system\nwe are in, it\u2019s essential to keep in mind\nwhat our goals are and what we value the\nmost. Different people have different\ngoals, and there is no standard to evaluate who is better than others. The most\nvaluable people are those who follow\ntheir hearts and benefit the world.\nA reflection on the ranking system.\nThere is No Dollar Sign on a Piece of Mind\nRuntianWu\nCommentWriter\nPhoto credits: Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu on Unsplash\nShould exam scores be the focus of a student\u2019s education?\nTRUE GREATNESS\nIS NOT ALWAYS\nREFLECTED IN\nSCORES\n\u201c\n\n"

The crucial COP26\nsummit currently being held in Glasgow\nhas meant that the Government\nhas new incentive to prioritise its\nenvironmental policies. The Autumn\nBudget, unveiled by Rishi Sunak last\nweek, was the chance for them to quite\nliterally put their money where their\nmouth is, and the Government took\nthe opportunity, with details of green\nprojects having slowly been released\nin the preceding days. Upon further\nreading, however, it is disappointingly\nclear that like every other challenge\nthey have faced, the Government\nhave fumbled this one as well.\nIt is important to not be too negative.\nThe UK has made excellent progress\nin its climate goals when compared\nto similar economies, aided by the\nextensive deployment of offshore wind\nfarms. Prior to the current energy crisis,\nthe UK completed the longest period\nof time without burning coal since\nthe start of the industrial revolution.\nIn the 15 years of reliable data prior\nto the pandemic, total emissions were\nreduced by 37% while GDP increased\nby 21%, almost halving the carbon\nintensiveness of the economy. In this\nregard, the UK is leading the world\nalong with Denmark, and is more than\nqualified to host a conference of this\nimportance.Theseinitialimprovements,\nhowever, are the easiest to achieve, and\nfuture improvements are reliant on\ncommitted funding by the Government.\nThe Build Back Better, Build Back\nGreener, and Levelling Up schemes\n\u2013 along with their buzzword-laden\nbrethren \u2013 have provisions to invest in\nlocal transportation. This year\u2019s budget\ninparticularhasemphasisedthefunding\navailable to cities to improve public\ntransport in the model of London, with\n\u00a35.7 billion being split between urban\nareassuchasGreaterManchesterandthe\nWest Midlands. \u00a3500 million has been\nallocatedtoredevelopraillinesdestroyed\nby the notorious Beeching cuts. Looking\nbeyond the headline figures, however,\nshows that of the approximately \u00a37\nbillion of funding promised, only about\n20% is new, with the rest comprising of\nmoneythathadalreadybeencommitted.\nMore worrying, however, is the\nimportance given to roads in this year\u2019s\nbudget. \u00a324 billion has been allocated\nover the next four years to build new\nroads or upgrade existing ones. 4000\nmiles of road are to be constructed,\nincludingnewtunnelsunderStonehenge\nand the Thames. Road construction is\nan incredibly carbon-intensive process,\nwith a review of a highway construction\nproject in Costa Rica finding that each\nkilometre of completed road emitted\nalmost 66 tonnes of greenhouse gases.\nHigherqualityroadsenticepeopletouse\nthem, and this induced demand will lead\ntomorecarsontheroad,thevastmajority\nof which are still powered by fossil fuels.\nHigher average speeds on these roads\nalso mean that vehicles are less fuel-efficient, further driving up emissions.\nTheGovernmenthastriedtosweepthe\neffects of its flagship Road Improvement\nScheme under the carpet, claiming that\nthe programme will only result in 0.27\nMt of CO2\nemissions over its reporting\nperiod from 2020 to 2032. This figure,\nhowever, only counts five of the 50\nprojects encompassed by the scheme.\nConstruction emissions have not been\naccounted for, along with increased\npollution resulting from induced\ndemand and higher travel speeds. This\nmeans that experts, including some\nof the Government\u2019s own advisors,\nhave stated that the emission estimate\nhas been reduced by a factor of 100 or\nmore. Grant Shapps, the Minister for\nTransport, overruled advice from the\ncivil service which recommended a\nreview of the plans on environmental\ngrounds. Instead of engaging with\nexpert advice and environmental\nprotest groups, the Government\nhas chosen to blindly continue\nwith their poorly justified plans.\nAnother disappointing result of the\nbudget has been the Government\u2019s\napproach to the airline industry. While\nBoris Johnson\u2019s use of a private jet to\nget to and from COP in Glasgow has\nmade headlines, the real harm is being\ndone quietly through a small sentence\nin the 2021 budget. From 2023, the\nGovernmentplanstohalveAirPassenger\nDuty (APD) for all domestic flights\nin the UK, making them significantly\ncheaper. This is being done at the\nsame time as UK train prices, already\namongstthehighestinEurope,arebeing\nincreased by an average of 3%, which is\ngreater than the rate of inflation. These\nchanges will only serve to heighten the\ndisparity that already exists \u2013 for the\nmost popular routes, train journeys\ncost 50% more than a domestic\nflight, despite emitting 80% less CO2\n.\nA simple way to look at governance is\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n10 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nMarie mori\nMonika yordanova\nEnvironment\nInfrastructure Budget 2021\nShrey Bohra Sustainability Writer\nPhoto credits: Singham from Pexels\n\n"

I\ntherefore chose to focus\nmy comment on your\nblatant sexism and how\nit is deeply flawed.\nI would have liked to refute your ar-guments, had you provided arguments\nto refute. You merely built yourself\na strawman, called it a \u201cmodern-day\nfeminist\u201d, and destroyed the stupid\narguments you created for it. You stand\nbefore your pathetic straw creation\nand exclaim \u201cLook at that feminist!\nSee how their arguments are ridiculous\nand self-contradictory! I am much\nsmarter than them, which is why I am\nnot a modern-day feminist.\u201d You have\nno knowledge of feminist movements\nand what their flaws are. You made\nthis obvious by failing to mention any\nfeminist movement you would align\nyourself with and refusing to discuss\nthe \u201cpast and history of feminism\u201d. Your\ngoal was not to criticise modern-day\nfeminism, an already diverse set of\nmovements, in comparison to older\nfeminist movements. On the contrary,\nyour goal was to criticise \u201cmodern-day\nfeminism\u201d in a vacuum, to make it clear\nthat \u201cmodern-day\u201d\nhad no meaning, and\nthat, when you finally\nrejected \u201cmodern-day\nfeminism\u201d, you were\nasking us to consider\nsexism as its preferable\n\u201cflip-side\u201d.\nFor that is what the\n\u201cflip-side\u201d of feminism\nis: the opposition to\ngender equality is the\nsupport of gender ine-quality. I have met my\nshare of closeted mi-sogynists, who would\nnever say aloud that\nthey support gender\ninequality and would\nrather try to discredit\nfeminism as an excuse\nfor their lack of support to the cause. Like\nyou, however, they never got very far in\ntheir main argument, which always was\nsome variant of \u201cfeminists should help\nmen, and they do not\u201d. Whinging about\nfeminists not focusing on men is doubly\nstupid. Firstly, it is a lie, as feminist\nmovements are very vocal about men\u2019s\nmental health and protecting male victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence,\nand rape. More importantly, it completely misses the point of feminism.\nWomen and non-binary people face\nlegal and social discrimination because\nof their gender in addition to racism,\nableism, social inequity, religious in-tolerance, or queerphobia (although it\nshould be pointed out that gender discrimination against non-binary people\nis different from gender discrimination\nagainst women, I believe that the fight\nfor gender equality should include the\nfight for trans-rights and the wider recognition of non-binary genders; when I\nlater refer to non-men, I refer to women\nand non-binary people, as they are part\nof underprivileged genders). Non-men\nalso die in wars, go to prison, live in\npoverty, and die of suicide, but their\nsufferings are made worse by gender\ndiscrimination. The point of feminism\nis not to abandon those fights which\ntackle issues faced by every gender,\nrather it is to not prioritise men over\nnon-men in these fights. When you call\nthese non-gendered issues \u201cmen\u2019s issues\u201d,\nit becomes very clear which gender you\nthink matters more.\nFinally, I will use your own argument\nof authority to show how Aristotle\nwould have supported feminist fights,\nhad Aristotle not been a huge misogy-nist. You misquoted Aristotle, and his\noriginal quote, \u201c[\u2026] it is thought that\njustice is equality, and so it is, though\nnot for everybody but only for those\nwho are equal; and it is thought that\ninequality is just, for so indeed it is,\nthough not for everybody, but only\nfor those who are unequal.\u201d (Politics,\nIII. V. 8.), addresses equality in the\ncontext of what is just. For example, a\nvery basic feminist application of that\nquote would be to make access to pads,\ntampons, and other hygienic products\nfree, and maybe promote paid leave\nfor painful menstruation. This would\nbe treating people unequally, as not\neveryone menstruates, but it would be\nunjust to not give special solutions to\npeople who menstruate on grounds that\nthis would be unfair to those who do\nnot. This is one example of a modern\nfeminist front. Obviously, not all feminist fights are worthwhile, and not all\nof them are just. Some are harmful and\nstem from hate, and we should all use\nour critical thinking to recognise and\nreject those. However, I do not think\nthe bad feminist movements should\never convince anyone that opposition to\ngender equality is a good thing. I think\nthat, while all feminist fights are not\ngood, all sexist fights are bad.\nTo sum it up, your article was a poorly disguised attack at what you wish\nmodern-day feminism was. You failed\nto observe how diverse feminist ideology is and always has been and made\nit obvious to all readers that you only\nwished to endorse sexism. Your expectation that feminism should prioritise\nmen in non-gendered issues is proof of\nhow deeply internalised your sexism is.\nAdditionally, your claims about false\nrape accusations are extremely disrespectful to survivors; that paragraph is\nvile and perpetuates a myth that forces\nvictims to stay silent and allows rapists\nto get away with their crimes. Your complete lack of empathy is ugly.\nIs Modern-Day\nSexism Flawed?\nOn the logical gymnastics sexists do to justify opposition to feminism.\nIrisClercq-Roques\nResponseWriter\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment\nHave an article in mind?\nEmail your idea or piece to:\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nHere, Iris Clercq-Roques provides a counter-argu-ment to last week\u2019s article by Srigan Moharir titled:\n\u2018Is Modern-Day Feminism Flawed?\u2019\nPick up next week\u2019s issue to read another counter-re-sponse to Moharir\u2019s article.\nIf you would like to join the discourse, email us at\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFeminist holding up an anti-sexism placard\nFeminist holding up an anti-sexism placard\nPhoto credits: Olia Danilevich on Pexels\nYOUR\nEXPECTATION\nTHATFEMINISM\nSHOULD\nPRIORITISE\nMEN IN NONGENDERED\nISSUES IS\nPROOF OF\nHOW DEEPLY\nINTERNALISED\nYOUR SEXISM IS\n\u201c\n\n"

The practice\nis not inherently detrimental to the\nenvironment in and of itself, and some\nsay that it is better than doing nothing.\nThe problem is that companies often\nlack transparency in the type of schemes\nthey are partnering with in efforts to call\nthemselves \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d\u2014schemes\nthat are oftentimes questionable.\nTwo budget airline companies,\nEasyJet and Jet2, have come out with\ngleaming new \u201csustainability strategies\u201d\nin the past months, in a supposed\neffort to combat climate change. By\nnow, we have learnt to be wary of\ncompanies and their claims of interest in\nprotecting the environment, and further\ninvestigation into their strategies find\nthat they are largely relying on carbon\noffsets to claim \u201ccarbon neutral\u201d flying.\nCritics of carbon offsetting say that\nit is merely a marketing strategy to\npersuade consumers to continue their\nconsumption by ridding them of their\nguilt. Jet2\u2019s strategy states \u201cWe have\nmade carbon offsetting an intrinsic part\nof our business strategy\u2026 it means our\ncustomers don\u2019t need to think about\ncarbon offsetting, because we\u2019ve got\ntheir carbon covered\u201d. These type of\nstatements removes the blame from\nthe consumer, when the one genuinely\neffective way to reduce one\u2019s carbon\nemissions would simply be to fly less\u2014\nthe 8.8% decrease in global carbon\ndioxide emissions in 2020 compared\nto 2019 was largely due to the fewer\nflights made during the peak of the\nCovid-19 pandemic. Of course, no\nairline company will be telling their\ncustomers to stop flying any time soon.\nJet2 also offers no insight into what\ntypes of carbon offsetting schemes\nthey are investing in, while one of the\nschemes that EasyJet does disclose\nadvertises the \u201ceventual halt of\ndeforestation in South American and\nAfrica\u201d.

Nine legal\nstudents at Vrije University\u2019s Climate\nChange and Sustainability Law Clinic\nin Amsterdam conducted research into\ntheir carbon offset schemes and found\nthat one was a pledge to protect a forest\nin Peru from logging, but \u201cthis forest\nwas not actually being logged in the\nyears before Shell started protecting it\u201d,\none of the students, Lisa van Langen,\nstated.

    "content": "Can I Live? is a 60-minute engaging performance\ntackling the pressing issue of climate change\nfrom points of view that are usually not considered.\nCombining hip-hop songs with a constant dialogue\nwith the audience, Fehinti Balogun creates an\noutstanding show, telling his story of climate change\nactivism to empower the viewer to take action.\nThe film begins with Balogun directly looking into\nthe camera, making the viewer feel as if they\u2019re in a\nfacetime call with a lifelong friend. If I\u2019m being honest,\nwhat impressed me the most was how inviting the\nexperience was. Balogun tells personal family stories in\norder to engage with the audience. At the same time,\nhe gives evidence to support his arguments about why\nclimate change is something we should all care about -and the reasons why it seems to be only white people\nthat are involved.\nSimilarly, it is important to highlight what seems\nto me to be the most important line of \u2018Can I\nLive?\u2019: \u201cclimate crisis is a class crisis\u201d. Often in our\nsociety we are told how we can contribute to helping\nthe environment by either buying eco-products in\ngrocery stores, or recycling. However, it is usually big\ncorporations which should be taking responsibility\nfor their pollution to the planet, as those with a lower\nfinancial status cannot afford to choose how to spend\ntheir money but rather have to focus on surviving until\nthe next paycheck.\nIn addition, Balogun has integrated a few song\nperformances with catchy lines that play repeatedly\nthroughout the feature to make \u2018Can I Live?\u2019\nmemorable for whoever is watching. Personally I\nbelieve this documentary has the power to influence\nanyone watching, regardless of age and background, as\nit is very visually clear to understand the problem.\nEven though most of the 60 minutes is Balogun\nconversing with the viewer, the end features dedicated\nactivists in organisations such as Seize the Vote, Border\nAbolition,StandUptoRacism,andWomenofColour\nin the Global Women\u2019s Strike, which support current\nmovements. Overall, \u2018Can I Live?\u2019 is a must watch\nexperience to become aware of how social inequalities\nare affecting climate change.\nSpecial thanks to the Barbican Centre, London\nfor the opportunity to watch this wonderful piece\nconceived, written and performed by Fehinti Balogun.\nYou can watch on the online tour until the end of\nNovember 2021.\nCan I Live?\nDocumentary\nFRIDAY 5TH NOVEMBER 2021\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 17\nEva Borras Film Editor\nBraindead\nFilm Review\nWelcome to the world of Peter Jackson before\nthe Lord of the Rings; if you know nothing\nabout it you\u2019re in for a ride!\n\u00ab Braindead \u00bb is the third film of Peter Jackson\nand part of a subgenre of horror called splatstick,\nwhich defines a horror comedy movie that focuses\non extreme gore for laughs. The word itself,\nsplatstick, is a combination of splatter for blood and\nslapstick, a style of humour that involves physical\nviolence deliberately exaggerated (like in Tom and\nJerry). With Sam Raimi\u2019s Evil Dead II and III,\nBraindead constitutes the figurehead of this niche.\nNow what is it about? A young man lives a miserable\nlife with his suffocating mother until he falls in love. At\nthe same time, the mother is bitten by a \u2018sumatran rat\nmonkey\u2019(noitdoesnotexist,don\u2019tgoogleit)andstarts\nto rot and eventually dies. Upon discovering that his\nmother is not dead, the hero decides to keep her in the\nbasementuntilhecanfigureoutwhattodo.Corpsesand\nundeadwillkeeppilingupinthemostunexpectedways.\nThis movie is one of the bloodiest ever made and I\nmeanthatliterally.Itissaidthat300litresoffakeblood\nwere used just for the final scene. It is quite hard to find\naccurate figures with reliable sources about the total\namount of fake blood used but everyone seems to agree\nthat it makes \u00ab Braindead \u00bb a serious competitor for\nthe bloodiest movie ever. Nonetheless, paradoxically, it\nis not the most violent movie, it is far from it actually.\nThe film may start slow - you will probably ask\nyourself what you are watching for a while - but it is\nabsolutely worth it. The humour is absurd, random,\ncreative, gory, cartoonish and completely gratuitous.\nYou just need to have the stomach for it as it can\nget quite disgusting. My personal recommendation\nwould be to watch it with friends for a good laugh.\nA fun fact about the actors is that they are all\ncompletely random people. For example, the main\nlead, Timothy Balme, had never seen a horror movie\nbefore. They certainly do not meet the standard of\n\u2018good actors\u2019 but they contribute to the charm of \u00ab\nBraindead\u00bbwhichlookslikeamovieoneofourfriends\ncould make if they were given enough money and time.\nNext time someone talks about being a Peter\nJackson fan after having only seen the Lord\nof the Rings, remind them that he made one\nof the goriest movies ever : \u00ab Braindead \u00bb !\nAur\u00e9lia Bordes Film Writer\nDirectedby: Daniel Bailey\nStarring: Fehinti Balogun\nDirectedby: Peter Jackson\nStarring: Timothy Balme, Diana Pe\u00f1alver, Elizabeth Moody and Ian Watkin\nYear: 1992\nWhat\u2019s on?\nFFF: French Film Festival\nThe festival will bring over 230 screenings of French\nand Francophone films, and in London, CIN\u00c9\nLUMI\u00c8RE will feature 17 films.\nThe festival opens on November 3rd with the UK\npremiere of \u2018France\u2019, starring L\u00e9a Seydoux.

    "content": "FRIDAY 5TH NOVEMBER 2021\n22\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nCOMMENT\n\u201cAs long as poverty, injustice and inequality prevail\nin our world, none of us can truly rest.\u201d\n-Nelson Mandela\nIbelieve the \u2018Poverty Line\u2019 is quite vague when it\ncomes to understanding the extent of poverty in\nthe contemporary world. It is not only vague because\nof its extremely narrow definition of \u2018who is poor\u2019 and\nthe debatable methodology used to count the poor,\nbut also because of a more fundamental assumption\nunderlying it. It completely depends on the idea of\npoverty as an inadequate income or not having the resources to purchase goods and services. For the scope\nof this article, I would like to categorize poverty as\npay destitution. If poverty is ultimately about deprivations affecting human wellbeing, then pay destitution is only one aspect of it. Income is no doubt a vital means to the attainment of individual well-being,\nbut I feel it is not adequate to ensure stability against\nnumerous other kinds of hardships that people face.\nFor example, illness due to communicable diseases\nlike COVID-19 can seriously affect the well-being of\nan individual whilst denying them of a healthy lifestyle\nandcurtainingtheirearningcapabilities.Thus,protect-ing people against such communicable diseases and the\nresultant hardships depends on various components\nlike safe drinking water, public sanitation, and mostly on good quality health services, not just income.\nAn entirely income-based approach to define poverty frequently falls short to reflect people\u2019s sufferings.\nSatisfaction of people\u2019s need, is another key aspect\nwhich is usually neglected - because the social provision of goods and services on offer is never considered.\nIt is also limiting to think of poverty essentially in\nterms of materialistic shortcomings of people relating\nto basic needs. We must also take into consideration\nsociological distress that people might have in the form\nof structural inequalities and inborn drawbacks. This\nclearly implies that even when resources are available,\npeople may not be able to take full advantage of them\nbecause of the pre-existing disadvantages ranging from\nsocial constraints like caste and gender, to personal impediments like old age and physical disabilities.\nBut the good news is that, inculcating diverse policy choices can definitely bring about distinctive results\nfor the people who are considered poor in a country.\nWhen governments create employment, enforce policies to increase the workers\u2019 wages and enhance the\nfinancial security of the poor, children and families\nsee improved results in both the short and long term.\nHence, an obvious question arises; how do\nwe eradicate the income-poverty issues which\nare at stake in many countries across the world?\nAfter a bit of research, I narrowed down the options to these solutions which might play a crucial\nrole in shaping the financial condition of people.\nRaise the minimum wage of workers.\nSupport pay equity.\nProvide paid leave and paid sick days.\nEstablish work schedules that work.\n(Low-wage and long hourly jobs increasingly come with unpredictable and constantly shifting work schedules, which\nmeans workers struggle even more to balance erratic work hours with caring for\ntheir families)\nInvest in affordable, high-quality childcare and early education\nReform the criminal justice system and\nenact policies that support successful\nre-entry.\nParticipate in the emerging global mar-kets.\nBut thinking practically, even if we present numerous more solutions to this problem, most\nof the global poverty issues boil down to undocumented and unregulated labour and work.\nAt the end of the day, everything is interdependent and bringing about a change in the attitude of\npolicymakers is quite a task especially when it comes\nto issues revolving around financial matters and pov-erty. I strongly believe that there is nothing inevitable\nabout poverty. We just need to build the political will\nto enact the policies that will increase economic secu-rity, expand opportunities, and help people enhance\ntheir overall standard of living. Finally, a resounding\nanswer to the original question put forth would be\nthat the entirety of poverty is much more than what\nwe perceive it to be and has a plethora of unexplored\ndimensions. Poverty beyond the \u2018Poverty Line\u2019 is\nsomething the world has collectively failed to address.\nAfterall, isn\u2019t it all about the greed of the\n\u2018Haves\u2019 and the wants of the \u2018Have-nots\u2019?\nHow we currently define poverty is limiting how we solve it. Writer Srigan Moharir reasons that we must expand the definition of\npoverty if we want to eradictae it.\nDoes the Poverty Line Define\nDestitution?\nSriganMoharir\nWriter\nTHE ENTIRETY OF\nPOVERTY IS MUCH\nMORE THAN WHAT WE\nPERCEIVE IT TO BE\n\u201c\nA small child begging for money on the streets.\nPhoto credits: Pixabay\nPhoto credits: Hitesh Choudhary on Pexels\nUnclean water makes people more vulnerable to illness.\n\n"

But here there is\na trick, as MIT researchers discovered in\n2003 that the Y chromosome can actually recombine with itself! This process\nis called gene conversion. The change\nof genes position inside the Y chromosome helps to correct mistakes because\nit avoids the stagnation of the genetic\ninformation. Furthermore, the impossibility of sex chromosomes to recombine\nwith each other is necessary to guarantee that the male determining genes\nare unaltered. This means that no male\ntraits would appear in women, preserving the male genes only in chromosome\nY, which is what makes it unique.\nOver the past 166 million years, the\nY chromosome has retained only 3% per\ncent of its original genes (from 1,500 to\n45 genes), but this rate of loss will not\nnecessarily continue into the future. Research comparing the Y chromosome\nin humans and rhesus monkeys in 2012\nproves the contrary, the human chromosome Y has only lost one gene since\ntheir diversion from rhesus monkeys\nin the tree of life 25 million years ago.\nOnly one! This means that the loss of genetic information in chromosome Y has\nreduced dramatically or even stopped.\nWe must consider that natural selection\nis eminently pragmatic. Only the useful\ntraits are preserved and transmitted to\nfuture generations.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nTheresultsofthemostrecentresearch\navailable clearly indicate that the extinc-tionofchromosomeYatleastinhumans\nseems to be far-fetched. However, other\nmammals, mainly rodents, are going in\na curious process of heterochromosom-al reorganization.

Will a new non-male and non-fe-male sex develop? If this happened in\nhumans, how would it look like?

ATES works by storing water in underground aquifers (porous rocks). In the summer, cool groundwater is extracted and\nused for building cooling. Heat from the building is transferred to the\nwater, which is then returned to the aquifer. In winter, this heated water\nis extracted and used for heating.

The subject matter of much of the artwork has\nbeenonallourmindsinrecenttimes,anditiscomfort-ing to see it all displayed like an awe-inspiring mood\nboard, especially after such a solitary year.\nA highlight of the exhibition is Felt Food by Sliz Gilard: felted and embroidered structures resembling a\nfood pantry. A woollen tin of \u201cBaked Boris\u201d alongside\n\u201cLoans and Poverty\u201d makes a striking statement about\nthe Free School Meals campaign.\nMuch like the rest of the exhibition, it is utterly\nunique and not to be missed.\nOld Bridge won playwright Igor Memic the 2020\nPapatango New Writing Prize, and rightfully so.\nSet amidst the burgeoning Bosnian war in the early 90s\nin the writers\u2019 hometown of Mostar in former Yugoslavia, the play follows the story of two youngsters, Mina\n(Saffron Coombar), a Bosnian Muslim, and a Mili\n(Dino Kelly), a half-Croat catholic, who get caught in\nthe growing turmoil of the war.\nThe play begins in 1988, just before the war, with\nMina and Mili first meeting each other and falling in\nlove. And flash-forward to 1992 when as war com-mences, life for them (and all around) becomes simply\nabout survival as Yugoslavia tears itself apart. The play\nprovideslittledetailonthespecificsofthewar,andthis\nin a way gives the story a certain fluidity; The story of\nMina and Mili could be that of any of the numerous\ninnocent civilians caught in the crossfire of conflicts\naround the world.\nThe acting in the play by all the actors was impres-sive.Thecharacterswerereallywelletchedoutandeach\npersonality brought something new to the group dy-namic; from the sarcastic Leila (Rosie Gray) and goofy\nSasha (Emilio Iannucci) to the sweet, teasing romantic\nleads Mina and Mili, as well as the older Mina (Susan\nLawson-Reynolds), who retrospectively narrates the\nstory of her youth.There are equal moments of humour\nand tragedy that keep the audience engaged, and the\nwriting and delivery are both on point. The set utilises\nminimalistic platforms at various heights to symbolise\nthe titular \u2018Old Bridge\u2019 across the Neretva River. This\nlack of formal set and props allows us to focus more on\nthe symbolism of the play and the dialogue between\ncharacters.\nThe only flaw, in my opinion, was the heavy empha-sisonnarrationandexpositioninthesecondhalfofthe\nplay. Whilst Lawson-Reynolds (as older Mina) does a\nbeautiful job of delivering this narration, the flaw in\nthe writing began to show itself when the narration began to hinder the flow of the story. The overreliance on\nmonologues slowed the pace of the story, especially at\nkey moments where there was so much happening.\nNonetheless, this was a fantastic play and I highly\nrecommend heading the Bush Theatre before the 20th\nof November to catch a showing.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n6\nARTS\nCredits: Photo/Marc Brenner\nEmilio Iannucci, Rosie Gray, Dino Kelly, Saffron Coomber in Old Bridge at the Bush Theatre\nA Balkan Romeo and Juliet story in Old Bridge\nReviewed by Shivani Gangadia Arts Writer\nOld Bridge\nWhere?

You might have gone\nas Alice for Halloween one year, or maybe the Mad\nHatter. Without a doubt, \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 is an\nintegrated part of English literature and culture. But in\nrealityitissomuchmoreconsequentialthanyoucould\never imagine. It has inspired everything from equality\nmovements to quantum physicists at CERN. The new\nexhibition at the V&A explores the full extent of the\nstory by Lewis Carroll, from the idea at a picnic on a\nhot summer\u2019s day, to the impact it continues to have\ncenturies later.\nThe first thing you\u2019ll learn is that Lewis Carroll\ndoesn\u2019t even exist. It\u2019s a pseudonym that Charles Dodgson came up with as a latinisation of his name. Dodgson is portrayed as a kind and creative genius, a lecturer\nof Mathematics at Oxford who loved entertaining children and members of his extended family in his spare\ntime. It was on an occasion when he had rowed up the\nriver Thames to spend some time with three girls (the\nso-called Liddell girls) that he came up with the story\nas a way to pass the time. One of the girls, Alice, on\nwhom he based the story, asked him to write it down\nand that marked the start of the book that has never\nbeen out of print since.\nA product of the Victorian era, \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 was always at the forefront of innovation. It was\none of the first phenomena for which \u201cmerchandise\u201d\nwas made. At the point it was made into a film it was\nthe longest film made in Britain, with a playing time\nof 10 minutes. Even when the new film version came\nout in 2010, it was one of the first major 3D films. To\nthink that it is a story where the hero is a little girl that\ntravels in time and space, a story that speaks to children\nbut has philosophical undertones for adults, and that\nit was written in the 1860s is quite remarkable. Up until the point it was written, most children\u2019s books were\nteaching a moral lesson rather than entertaining. The\nconcept of \u2018nonsense\u2019 was certainly not a part of fic-tion. No wonder it has inspired artists, activists, writ-ers, chefs, marketing agents and scientists worldwide.\nNames such as Salvador Dali and Aldous Huxley have\nco-operated and lent their creative interpretations of\nthe story. Japanese anime-versions of the film exist, and\na Swahili translation from the 1950s is on display at the\nexhibition as just one example .\nYou will definitely want to reserve a couple of hours\nfor the exhibition. It is impressingly extensive and\ndeeply explorative. The curators have done a fantastic job at grouping together themes and building up a\nstory. Don\u2019t worry about getting bored, the rooms are\ninteractive and playful, entertaining both toddlers and\nadults alike.\nA day in wonderland\nReviewed by Amanda Hertberg Arts Writer\nAlice:\nCuriouser and Curiouser\nWhere?

However,\nlike many other events in recent memory, it has been\nrepeatedly postponed and so here we are now, with a\nsummer exhibition happening in autumn-winter.\nOften described as the \u201canything and everything\u201d\nshow, the exhibition is a dizzying array of artwork, a\nspace to display and sell work by British artists, conceived in the year before. The RA, like many other in-stitutions,hasbeenshutformuchofthepasttwoyears,\nand with this exhibition, it has reopened with a weird\nyet wonderful feast for the senses.\nThis year\u2019s theme is \u201cReclaiming Magic\u201d, which the\nexhibition co-ordinator, Yinwa Shoniabare says is\nabout restoring value to marginalised practises. Taking\nplace in the autumn-winter is not the only thing that\nsets it apart from previous Summer Exhibitions. The\nexhibition begins with a piece of work created decades\nago by the American artist Bill Traylor. The self-taught\nartist was born into slavery in the US in 1854 and did\nnot start painting till he was 85 and, in many ways, having his work introduce the show is a fitting reflection\nof the climate of the past two years. With a slight nod\nto the RA\u2019s founding legacy from the heyday of transatlantic slavery, Shonibare\u2019s introduction of the work\nunderscores how Bill Traylor\u2019s work singularly inspired\nlooking beyond the boundaries of Western Art history.\nThe exhibition\u2019s artwork is diverse not just in the\nbackground of its artists and the themes explored, but\nalso in its media. Traditional oil paintings are housed\nalongside sculptures, knitting, and quilting, and the\nsheer abundance of work means it is hard to focus on\none piece for very long. It is even harder to pick a fa-vourite. With a total of 1382 pieces of art on display,\nthe exhibition is overwhelming, and each tall room is\nfilled with hundreds of artworks from floor to ceiling.\nSome themes of the work are to be expected; depic-A (late) summer exhibition at the RA\nReviewed by Simran Kukran Arts Writer\nSummer Exhibition 2021\nWhere?

    "content": "On the 31st of October, after 18\nmonthsofCOVID-inducedhiatusfrom\nuniversity, American Football\u2019s Imperial\nImmortals boarded a coach to play their\nopening game of the season against the\nQueen Mary Vipers, looking to not only\nstart strong but also to exorcize some of\nthe old demons from the opposition\u2019s\nfield. From the opening whistle, the\nImmortals\u2019 defense stood strong, especially the front 6 which was being led\nby Will \u201cWar Daddy\u201d Woodward. On\nthe opening drive, the unit managed to\nscore a safety and continued the strong\nperformance throughout the game with\nmultiple tackles for loss, sacks, and an\ninterception by Finn \u201cStage Man\u201d Corney. Unfortunately, a couple of broken\nplays led to the Vipers scoring twice (ru-mour has it that some questionable calls\ncan be blamed for at least one of them\nbut that is unconfirmed). The offense,\nafter a half of shaking the rust off, started doing the unthinkable even for the\noldest of old boys: moving the chains by\npassing the ball. Credit for that has to\nbe given to the team\u2019s quarterback Alex\n\u201cFree Man\u201d Stocks and his receiving\ncrew where everyone has been making\nimpressive plays: from breaking ankles,\nthroughone-handedcatches,toamazing\ntoe-taps. Unfortunately, all good things\ncome to an end and the last drive, during which the offense was marching for\nan equalizer with the help of Tim \u201cJogger\u201d Hindges, was ended with an interception by the Vipers on a fourth down,\nending the game. The first game was also\nan opportunity for the team\u2019s rookies to\nexperience an American Football game\nfor the first time. And since they are Immortals, many of them, including Alain\n\u201cBetrayed by Meetup Time\u201d Geneste,\nfully embraced the ages-old tradition of\nplaying both ways. On the coach back\nfrom the game all of them have also\ngiven the team their best comedy and\nvocal performances as everyone\u2019s eyes\nturn away from the close loss towards\nour next game: the home opener against\nthe ARU Rhinos on the 7th of November.

Ultimate\ntournament, creatively named in a contest by one of their members, Mahdi\nRahim (Mahd). The event started right\nafter lunch, with six monitor-console\nset-ups available to play on in the Royal School of Mines G01 room. After\nchecking-in all 25 participants, a dou-ble-elimination bracket was drawn, and\nthe matches started. The ICLGE Twitch\nlivestream showed some of the sets during the day, having the participants cast\nand comment. The Scottish fresher Lachlan Jarvie (Jarv) and the Egyptian\nfresh graduand Yusuf Ismail (QSFW)\nrose to the top, fighting each other in\nthe Winners\u2019 Final. Playing very safe and\ncalculative, Jarvie\u2019s Inkling and Ismail\u2019s\nPyra & Mythra (Pythra) spent most of\nthe time on stage, not risking off-stage\nedgeguards. Being two games down in\nthe Winners\u2019 Final, Jarvie decided to go\nwith a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer counterpick.\nAfter about a stock, he grasped that Pythra was unable to respond to Ivysaur\u2019s\ncolossal aerial hitboxes, with Charizard\non the side doing a decent job at high\npercentages. But it was too late. Ismail\ndid not miss his Pyra punishes, killing\nthe dragon with an F-tilt at just 100%.\nLosing in the top bracket did not seem\nto bother Jarvie\u2019s nerves of steel. He\nwent on to beat Rahim\u2019s Joker by 3-1 in\nthe Loser\u2019s Final, the last round of repe-chage, to come back to have his revenge\nagainst Ismail. Changing his gameplan\nsignificantly, we saw a lot more ink on\nstage, having roller and up-smash show\nup on the screen every couple seconds.\nPythra had no response to such options,\nfalling for every trap laid out in Inkling\u2019s\nneutral. Jarvie took back Grand Finals\nwitha3-1,andcrownedhimselfchampi-on after winning the Grand Finals Reset\nby the same score.

Even if - the probable\noutcome is failure.\u201d\n-Elon Musk\nWith this quote, we start this article about one of the most inspiring and unique characters in human his-tory: Elon Musk, who was born in June\n1971 in Pretoria, South Africa. As a\nchild, Elon Musk was independent and\nlearnt on his own, stating that he was\neducated first by the books and then by\nhis parents. Indeed, he taught himself\nprogramming and created a videogame\ncalled Blastar, which he sold for $500\nby the age of 12. At the age of 17, he\nmoved to Canada to study at Queen\u2018s\nUniversity so as to avoid the obligatory\nmilitary service in South Africa. Two\nyears later, he was transferred to the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and ended\nup graduating with a double bachelor\u2018s\ndegree in physics and economics, a\nclear prelude of his future job. Then he\npursued a PhD in materials science and\napplied physics at Stanford University.\nHowever, he dropped out two days later\nin order to fund a company called Zip2\nand the rest is history.\nNowadays, Elon Musk is one of the\nwealthiest men in the world with a net\nworth of around $151 billion, owning\nseveral companies with very ambitious\ngoals in mind. SpaceX aims to commer-cializespacetravelandmakehumankind\na multi-planetary civilisation; SolarCity\nproduces sustainable energy, while Tesla\ncan store that energy in its electric batte-ries; The Boring Company is designing\na complex network of tunnels to avoid\ntraffic jams and ease public transport in\ncities. Although none of his objectives\nhave been accomplished yet, Elon Musk\nand his staff are taking little steps towards them. And this is something that\nI want to outline, although it is a reality\nthat Elon Musk will\nbe remembered by\nfuture generations,\nhe would not be able\nto achieve his success\nwithout an extraordinarily talented team\nbehind him. Could\nNapoleon Bonaparte have won his wars\nalone? The answer is\ncertainly no; excep-tionalleadersarekeytotriggermeaning-ful changes, but leaders\u2019 plans would not\nbe executed if there were no other people working for them. The day a rocket\nlandsonMars,weshouldrememberthat\nit is not Elon Musk who arrived at Mars,\nbut mankind. There is an excessive adoration towards the figure of a person because humans need heroes to adore, but\nreality is much more complex than just\none person.\nNot considering himself a businessman but an engineer when tackling\nproblems; his approach is always based\non the scientific method. The steps to\nfollow, like many other great ideas, are\nsimple. First, ask a question. Second,\nfind evidence to develop axioms, classifying each one of them from less to\nmore probable. Third, with these axioms\nnow you can establish a conclusion relevant to the question proposed in step\none. Fourth, attempt to dismantle your\nconclusion. As a tip, it is recommended\nto ask for others\u2018 points of view. Finally, if the conclusion is found incorrect,\ngo back to step two to formulate new\naxioms or find new evidence. In the case\nthat no one can refute the conclusion,\nthen it is arguably correct, and only ar-guably, because there is never an absolutely correct answer, every theory or law\nhas some degree of error. The scientific\nmethod is the most plausible way to obtain realistic and effective solutions, but\nwith certain flexibility to modify them\naccording to new\ncircumstances. Besides, it avoids wishful\nthinking, which is\nbasically the claim of\nthe truthfulness of\nsomething just because of the desire of\nthat something being\ntrue. Elon Musk is\nalso a visionary, innovating in each sector\nhe is involved in. Examples of this are\nthe reusable rockets of SpaceX, or the\nelectric cars of Tesla - when nobody believed in neither their relevance nor pro-fitability. Elon Musk was even criticised\nby Neil Armstrong, who believed that\nhis ideas of reusable rockets were far-fet-ched. According to Elon Musk though,\nthe key to being innovative is starting\nwith an unbiased mind and clear objectives to pursue. Most people commit the\nmistake of adding little modifications\nto a widespread product or service and\nconsider it \u201cinnovation\u201d. Avoid following what the mainstream is doing. In\na world where machines are encroaching\nthe most boring and repetitive tasks, the\nvalue of a creative and innovative mind\nis rising exponentially as there is still no\nsuch AI capable of imitating the flexibility and spontaneity of the human brain.\nHowever, not only is Elon Musk\nknown for his contribution to sustainable transport and space travel, but also\nfor his manifold controversial moments.\nOne of the most memorable moment\nwas when he smoked weed during a\npodcast with the comedian Joe Rogan\nin September 2018. The reaction of the\ngeneral public was immediate, the podcast became viral with almost 48 million\nviews up to date and GIFs of Elon Musk\nwith the marijuana cigar have become\na popular meme. The \u201cjoint\u201c also instigated NASA to open an investigation\nabout the health and safety standards\nof SpaceX, and there was a general devaluation of Elon\u2018s companies in the\nstock market. Twitter is the most used\nsocial media by Elon Musk to express\nhis opinions to his millions of followers\nand it also one of the major sources of\nElon Musk\u2019s controversy. His incendiary tweets are abundant, but the most\nimpactful were \u201cTesla stock price is too\nhigh imo\u201c (May 2020), which caused\nthe company to lose $14 billion in Tesla\u2018s value, or \u201cThe coronavirus panic is\ndumb\u201c (March 2020), among many ot-hers. I am conscious that Elon\u2019s honesty\nand impulsiveness are what make him\nunique. When you hear him speaking,\nyou feel as if you\u2019re listening to someone\nauthentic, despite his monotonous and\nrobotic voice. However, it is undeniably\nthe relevance of his position as he moves\nmillions or even billions of dollars every day, as well as being the CEO of two\ncompanies (Tesla and SpaceX) that are\nauthentic leaders and innovators of their\nrespective sectors. Any of his actions can\nshape the global economy and millions\nof lives. Therefore, I consider that such\na powerful individual who is at the forefront of humanity\u2019s progress has to be\ncommitted to his position, giving up a\npart of his personality for the sake of the\nrest of the people.\nElon Musk is a source of inspiration\ndue to his ambition, perseverance, and\npeculiar personality. He has enough capital to make a real impact on the world\neven though we have not seen any life-changing results from him yet. Most cars\nare still powered by fossil fuels, and I am\nnot travelling to Mars the next year. Nevertheless, we must be hopeful and patient with the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX.\nIn the meantime, chase your own goals\nbecause reading about outstanding individuals is great, but not as great as actually becoming one of them.\nElon Musk, a Man Destinated to\nChange the Fate of Mankind\nWangGuo\nWriter\nLoved and hated by many people worldwide, Elon Musk is a trendy topic nowadays. And this is not a surprise as he is not only one\nof the richest men in history, but his eccentric personality and controversial declarations are also a magnet for sensationalist news\nand for heated discussions on Twitter.\nPhoto credits: The Royal Society on Wikimedia Commons\nPortrait of Elon Musk\n\n"

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\n8 Science.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nHuman cells each contain 23 pairs\nof chromosomes, where each\nchromosome consists of a long strand\nof DNA. 22 of these pairs are the same\nfor both men and women and are called\nautosomes. The 23rd pair is different\ndepending on the sex: cells with two X\nchromosomes (XX) develop into the female sex, whilst cells containing both X\nand Y chromosomes (XY) develop into\nthe male sex. The reason that the Y chromosome is sex-determining is because it\ncontains the SRY gene. This gene allows\nthe synthesis of a protein called the tes-tis-determining factor, essential for male\ndevelopment.\nWHEN DID THE Y\nCHROMOSOME APPEAR?\nThe modern X and Y chromosomes\noriginallyevolvedfromapairofidentical\nautosomes. Recent research\nsuggests that the divergence\nof the ancestor autosome\ninto the X and Y forms occurred around 166 million\nyears ago when some species\nof the order Monotremata - including the famous\nplatypus - had split from\nother mammals. Mammals\nbefore that did not have any\nsex chromosomes, but this\nmammal ancestor carried a\nmutation in one of the au-tosomes which caused it to\nbe male. Over the course of\nnatural selection, mutations\nthat were beneficial to males\nand neutral or harmful to\nfemales would accumulate\non that autosome, which\nover time became the modern Y chromosome.\nWHAT ARE THE REASONS\nTO BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE\nDISAPPEARANCE OF THE Y\nCHROMOSOME?\nFirstly, the Y chromosome is susceptible to higher rates of mutation and thus\nthe genes on the Y chromosome may\nbe less likely to be preserved over time.\nWhen a sperm cell fertilizes an ovule\nto produce a zygote, each one of them\npossesses half of the total genome of a\nhuman being. Thus, ovules only have X\nchromosomes while spermatozoids\nonly have X or Y chromosomes, giving females and males the XX and XY\ngenotypes, respectively. The Y chromosome actually has a higher mutation rate\nthan the X chromosome because men\nproduce millions of sperm cells per day\ncompared to one single egg of women\nper month. More cell divisions of the\nsperm cells make the DNA more susceptible to more mutations.\nMoreover, sperm cells are very mo-bile, necessitating the production and\nconsumption of large quantities of ATP,\nthe molecule required for all energetic\nprocessesoflife.TheprocessofATPsyn-thesis is not perfect; it produces some\nmolecules termed Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) which are, as their name in-dicates, highly reactive. ROS are one of\nthe main causes of mutations or damages in the DNA of cells. Sperm cells also\nhave relatively less cytoplasm (the thick\nsolution filling the cell), which acts as an\nantioxidantagainstROS.Theyarethere-fore more vulnerable to ROS \u2018attack\u2019.\nSecondly, each cell only contains one\ncopy of Y chromosome genes. All genes\ncontained on autosomes have two cop-ies, one on each chromosome in the pair,\nbut since there is only ever one Y chromosome in the cell, if a gene is mutated\nthere will be no \u2018backup\u2019 copy to recuperate the lost function. Usually, autosomal chromosomes can avoid passing\nharmful mutations on to offspring by a\nprocess called recombination whereby it\nswaps geneic material with its counter-part, which lacks the mutation. However, this process relies on similarity\nbetween the swapping pairs. Since the\nX and Y chromosomes are not similar\nenough the recombine out harmful mu-tations, they will remain on the Y chro-mosome. Natural selection will favour Y\nchromosomes without these mutations,\nthus the Y chromosome gets smaller and\nsmaller.\nThe continuous accumulation of\nDNA mutations, loss of genes and the\npressure of natural selection will cause\nthe disappearance of the functional\nY chromosome in roughly 10 million\nyears; although there are investigations\nthat indicate 5 million years or even less.\nContinued on page 6...\nWang Guo Science Writer\nA karyotype (image of chromosomes) of the human male chromosomes, with the Y chromosome highlighted.\nOur sex is determined by the chromosomes X and Y.

The\nunfolding dance between the two, with Thelma trying\nto convince Jesse otherwise, Jesse\u2019s past and her \u2018reasons\u2019, and the eventual \u201c\u2019night, Mother\u201d, takes its course\non stage over the span of the next 80 minutes in this\nuniquely American (Nay! Texan) drama.\nIn my book, a show is always the sum of its parts.\nThe script, direction, light & sound design, and acting\nall need to come together coherently to result in some\nsort of catharsis. This structure of evaluation and appreciation remains the same whether it\u2019s an original, an\nadaptation, or a rerun. Unfortunately, these elements\nfail to strongly converge in this play.\nChanning and Night\u2019s\nacting comes and goes in\nwaves. In their individual\nscenes they both show great\ntalent and flair; together\nwith the writing they are\nable to move the audience\nto tears. But, whilst sharing the stage amidst con-versations, the chemistry\nof a mother-daughter duo\nfeels amiss. There are a few\nhighlights that are nevertheless stupendous and hit\nhome strongly (the monologues towards the end are\na treat for any theatre aficionado who appreciates a\ngood script and acting \u2014 more on that later). But these\nscenes are too far and few between to sustain us over\nthe short run of the play.\nThroughout, the characters move about the set,\nseemingly preoccupied, emptying and filling jars just to\ngive the impression they aren\u2019t there all by themselves,\nspeaking into a void. And, as such, the set design, as\nmasterfully crafted as it is, crumbles away and remains\none step removed from the rest of the drama \u2014 failing\nto cohere with the story or the\ncharacters.\nJesse\u2019spast,herhistoryofepilepsy, and the family\u2019s discord-antrelationshipisnotexplored\nconvincingly enough, and with\nsuch a short run time, this miss\ndoes seem unconvincing. The\nwriting in the play\u2019s denouement seems highly reminiscent\nof Jean Rhys in her novel Good\nMorning, Midnight (its theme\nof depression and despair also\nresonating with this play); and\ndare I say, Noah Baumbach\u2019s\nwriting in Marriage Story. Not\nsure if the writer of this play\ntook inspiration from Jean\nRhys, or if Baumbach took inspiration from them both\n\u2014 but the similarities result in a pleasant and satisfying\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for anyone who has sampled these works. The\nwriting is highly persuasive and is thus a testament to\nthe raw talent behind it, that, in parts, leads us to dismiss all other misgivings.\nAnd it is this fallacy that intrigues us; or rather\nkeeps us engaged, where we are left disinterested one\nmoment, only be yanked out of such a state by a sheer\nmoment of genius in the next.\nAsImademywaytothetheatre(Istressenoughthat\nI did not make this up), I overheard a gentleman trying his best to\u2013impress his partner no doubt\u2013articulate his understanding of theatre by using the following\nquote \u201cgoing to theatre for me is like church\u201d. Without delving deep into the cheesiness of the metaphor\nor the religiosities of this couple, if we are to take this\nperson\u2019s word for it \u2014 then this billing would certainly fit the description. Rich Texan accents, period set-ting, guns and violence, discordant families, teeny-tiny\nabsolution \u2014 and the placebo feeling of satiation. In\nthis sense, \u2018night, Mother is a show to be experienced:\njust as an atheist might feel compelled to step into the\nthreshold of an altar, to know if the few absolutions of\nreligion are enough to move them.\nAre the parts greater than their sum? Are few moments of absolution or catharsis worth the whole song\nand dance of a lifetime (or in this case an 80-minute\nshow)? If these questions intrigue you, ponder on at\nHampstead Theatre, where this show runs until 4th December 2021. You will not be disappointed.\nGood morning, midnight... mother!\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\n\u2018night, Mother\nWhere? Hampstead Theatre\nWhen?
