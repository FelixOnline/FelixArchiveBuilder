    "content": "2 FELIX UNION FINALE\nDEMOLITION SPIRIT PREVAILS IN BAR\nAt 11.45 p.m. on Saturday, Maroh 26th, the old\nUnion Bar was closed for the very last time. On\nits final evening the Bar and Union were filled with\nexuberant revellers, who refused to let their spirits\nbe damaged by the shadow of sadness which hung over\nthem. As closing time approached the company linked\nhands for \"Auld Lang Syne\" and, after giving three rousing cheers each for Ted and Tom , moved slowly from\nthe Bar. Appropriately enough, last man to leave was\nTed Smith, who has served behind that historic oo unter for twenty-eight years, and who has made hundreds of\nlasting friends among the many students he has met.\nThe \"Bar Cooling Party\" was pre cee ded by a combined\n'22, Links and Chaps Glubs Dinner, at wh i oh Ted's health\nwas proposed by one of his oldest customers and closest\nfriends, Charles Bristow. The Dinner.was illuminated\nby candle-light, and one of the diners discovered only\nJust in time that someone had placed one of the candles\ndirectly beneath his seat during the meal.\nDr. K.E. Weale in an impromptu masterpiece, expressed everyone's sentiments when he pointed out that\nthis was merely a discontinuity in the life of the Bar\nand our cry should be not a lament but, thinking of the\nfuture, \"The Bar is dead. Long live the Bar.\"\nAfter Dinner, the Union was the scene of some energetic sport, of which the most boisterous consisted of\ntoboggan ning down the staircase on upturned tables.\nThere was also some disorganised so rur arn aging in the Lower\nDining Hall, where, at Mr. Mooney's suggestion, a condemned\nwall was destroyed with battering rams in order to save\nthe contractors some time.\nThe Upper Dining Hall was busy throughout its last\nweek, and its real climax was reached on Wednesday, March\n23rd, on the occasion of the Rugger Club Dinner. This\nwas notable for the tremendous spirit and enthusiasm\nwhich permeated the entire proceedings. Even aged veterans of the club could not recall a more successful eve-ning. Biggest cheer of the night went to the club's favourite Barman and guest - Ted Smith.\nIt is good to report that the two best-loved rooms\nin the old Union should have enjoyed suo h successful conclusions to their memorable history.\nNORTHERN HOSPITALITY\nENQ SOC VISITS BILL INGHAM\nTuesday, 29th March, saw 18 Meohanioal Engineers\nfighting for seats on the \"Northiimbrian\" Express at Kings\nCross bound for Billingham-on-Tees near Middleshorough. Thi\u00ab\nvisit to end all visits was certainly the finest excursion\never organised by the Guilds Engineering Sooiety.\nSurprisingly enough everybody did get seats, and the\njourney to York soon passed to the a ooo mpa nie ment of wine,-,\nsong, and the usual pack of cards. The party changed\ntrains at York, shepherded by Maloolm Deere, and at tea\ntime we were greeted by our hosts, the I.C.I, at Stockton,\nwho took us to one of the best hotels in the dist riot. Memories are rather dim about the magn if io ent dinner\nand subsequent film show; some can't even remember going\nto bed. The next morning saw 18 highly polished engineers\narriving for breakfast, which was followed by a day of\nworks touring. The early evening saw us downing cocktails at a local country o lub, when many tunes well known\nin South Ken. were introduced to Northumbria.\nOn returning to our hotels, we had another good dinner and then set out to paint the town red and silver.\nSome of U3 went to the pictures while some went dancing,\nor so they said. At eleven-o'o look the fun started. Mr.\nDeere found his bed quite unusable and his night attire\nlikewise, while Ian Bell found his shoes had sprouted\nhigh heels. Tea was ordered through the early hours, and\na Boomelaka rendered on the stairs. Most of the party\ndid sleep a bit, although one group played cards until\n3-o 'clock and then turned Ian Bell and Derek Gotham out\nof bed. To crown it all, Messrs. Deere and Gotham found\nthemselves well and truly screwed into their room, as a result of which Howard Panton and Mike Amsden went shoe-less for some time.\nThe last day was spent touring the I, CI. 's Wilton\nWorks,followed by a splendid lunch. Then we were driven\nto Darlington Station to oat oh the homeward train. Here\nwe made the acquaintance of two young ladies of Newcastle\nUniversity who did not seem to mind playing poker at all. At Kings Cross again, this memorable visit o a me to a close. But not quite. One of the a fore mentioned young\nladies was escorted home - well done Mike. Trust a Guildsman .....\nM. T.D. EASTER CONCERT IS A SUCCESS\nI.C. Musical Society, ably supported by the\nJacques Orchestra, conducted by Doctor Brown,\ncelebrated Baster with an ambitious programme\nof music at Q.A. H. on March 17th., which was,\non the whole, successful. Two short pieces led\nto the main work; these were an Adagio and Glgue\nby Oaluppi and \"The Pharisee and the Publican\"\nby SchOtz. Tone and diction were very good in all the choral items but the choir is \"bottom\nheavy\" and so the tenors are almost drowned and\nthe whole choir is pulled down. The main work\nwas \"Acis and Galatea\" by Handel, in which the\nsoloists were Norma Morgan, soprano, Maurice\nfear mouth, tenor, and Ranken Bushby, bass - three\nlovely voices which were a pleasure to listen to.\nGood soloists have a considerable affect on the\npresentation of any work; the choir were most\nfortunate in their choice of soloists.\nFrom Handel to parry is a Jump which made\n\"Blest Pair of Sirens\" even more exciting and\nexhilarating. It was very well sung indeed. I think the choir enjoyed it as much as we did.\nThe musical society are to be commended for\ntrying to pee sent something different but surely\nit is better to include the more unusual pieces\nin a programme of well known music. People who\nattend amateur concerts are not usually so much\nmusic lovers as friends of the performers and\nwould enjoy the concert so much more if the music\nwere familiar.\nWe look forward to another concert by the soc--iet yin the near future.\nS.R. G.c on td. from page I. MIXED DRINKS-MIXED HOCKEY\nThe afternoon saw the whole I.C. party congregated\nat the Groningen H.C. ground where a tournament (with\ntwo pool3 of three Teams) was to take place. The games\nwere to be of 40 minutes duration each. In the first\ngame we drew with Forward 0-0 and in the 3e cond we beat\nG.B. H.S. by 3-0. Then we again played Forward. this time\nplaying mu oh better and we won 3-1. In the final, against\n* Groningen H.C., we played the best Hockey seen from an I.C. Team for years, to draw 2-2; the strength of the Groningen team can be judged from the fact that they are this\nyear the Champions of the North Netherlands Premier League.\nAfter all this exertion, we were confronted with a dance\narranged for us in the evening: those with sufficient\nenergy danced j while the majority could not do much more\nthan raise glass to mouth. Sunday was to be our last\nday in the Netherlands and most people did not rise until\nnoon or later. We had foolishly arranged to play a game\nof Mixed Hockey in the afternoon with the help of some of\nthe local talent but when it came to the point of actually\nrunning about we were completely lost: all energy seemed\nto have left us. The game ended in a draw.\nHaving said our farewells we departed from Groningen\nand returned by the night-boat, arriving bao kin England\nmuch too early on Monday morning.\nSOCIAL a ATHLETIC SUCCESS\nTo summarise the results of our Hockey Matches; in eight days we played eight games of Hockey of which we\nWON5, DREW2 and LOST 1. We3 cored23 goals and conceded 9. These results exclude the mixed game played on\nSunday. Of the playing members of the party, none played\nin less than 3 games while the Oaptain sacrificed himself\nto the extent of playing in all 9. The Hon. Sec. of 1.0.0.\nwho came at the last moment to replace John Newell (who\nbroke his collar bone) acquitted himself nobly and actually\nplayed in two of the games.\nBoth from the Soolal and Athletic point of view, this\nwas a very fine Tour and there is no doubt that it will\nlire very long in the minds of all those who participated.\nTHE PROF MAKES THEM LAUGH Dr. Willis Jackson made both members and guests\nof the Radio Sooiety rook with laughter at his anecdotes * in one of the wittiest speeches heard for some\ntime at the annual dinner in the Ayrton Hall. He especially warned the assembled company of the dangers of\nmixing two lumps of Plutonium in Christmas stockings,\nreciting an amusing little verse on the subject.\nMr. Urquhart-Pullen, the Honorary Secretary of the\nSociety, thanked the doctor, and gave a short history\nof the Society during the past year. Other speakers\nwere Dr. Lamb, F. Adorian Esq., S.G. Reece, and M.F. Beddoes. Apart from the anecdotes, j the occasion was\nmarked as one of Miss Bowling's last Dinners in the .ayr-ton Hall. _ ,\n\u2014 *See Nelson'a Column.\n\n"

LOSE THREE HARD-FOUGHT MATCHES\nAs a conclusion to the season the Rugger clue visited the West Country for three fixtures against opponents that promised to he the roost formidable the college\nhas yet encountered. It was therefore with some foreboding that the party left the o rumbled union by coach\nbut short sojourns at hostelries en route previously well\ntried by members of other touring parties, fortified all for the following days match.\nBrilliant sunshine greeted us in Cornwall and an inspection of the Falmouth ground found it to be bone hard\nin spite of the valiant attempts of the grounds men with\nhose and water. I.C. had to make a number of changes in\nthe team advertised on the programme, due to absence owing to injury of our more outstanding backs. From the\nwhistle play was fast and open, with the I.C. forwards\nholding their own against the sturdy Falmouth pack. Our\nopponents fielded two guest players, with county o ap Roy\nHarris behind the scrum, and international trialist Rosen\nat stand-off, the latter making many fine breaks for the\nhome side. Heam at stand-off half for I.C. played well\nboth in attack and defence and made mu oh ground with some\nfine kicking. The three quarters played well in attack\nbut were unable to stop a Falmouth try in the corner after\na cross kick. Later bad tackling allowed Hosen to put\nhis centres over for another try in the middle but I.C. were now playing with only 14 men, look forward Toynbee\nhaving departed with a dislocated thumb. In the seo on d half, I.C. ret allia ted with a try from full bao k Thomson\nwho was a lv rays ready to come into the attack and Hearn .\nkicked a penalty goal from far out.' Time was against us\nhowever, and the final whistle saw us down by 11 pts. to\nFREE FOR ALL ...\nSaturday afternoon one change was made in the side\nto meet Peiiryn the match being played before a moderate\ncrowd on equally hard 'ground. Fenryn have a record second only to that of Redruth in Cornwall and many a great\ntouring side has fallen at their hands. In the first\nhalf I.C. maintained a territorial advantage throughout\nbut failed to snap \"xg two simple scoring oh ances. A break away attack from Penryn with a defensive mistake\nallowed\"the home side to put on five points before the\ninterval. Later Heam kicked a penalty goal for I.C. but the game now became scrappy with each side sie zing on the other's mistakes. The Penryn backs scored again\nbut their pack tired towards the end and I.C. were pressing hard when to cries of \"Sport\" from oo lle ge supporters\nin the stand, a pitched battle developed on the field.\nThis, a very nervous referee failed to quell completely,\nand the whistle for no side went short of time.\nATHLETIC CLUB The tourists* PHOTO BT L.E. PAI\nEli the \"Fifteen Balls\",thw headquarters of the Penryn ol nba mio a KLe relations were restored after the mato h with winkle s and o or nish pasties.\nA survey of the number of fit men left to talks the field\nagainst the Camborne team was made and the shortage of good\nreserves caused the side to be weakened ,but it was pleasing\nto see Peaooeke playing in his first game since before Christ-'\nmas,where he made a sensational appearance as wing three-quarter. Ten thousand gallons of water on the pitch in the\nmorning had made it a little softer ,but the ground still remained hard and it was perhaps this that a oo outed for the\npoor I.C tackling.For the first time on the tour our pack\nfailed to hold the opposing forwards and Camborne soared,\nfour times in the first half.After the interval I.C, retaliated with a dropped goal by Hearn and a try from Barnes,but\nweak tackling allowed Camborne to cross our line again.\nConsidering the s tre ngh of the opposition and the\nconditions ,the results in the first two mato he s especially\nreflected credit on the club ,and it is hoped that the) tour\nwill become a regular- feature in the Rugby a a Xs nder The Athletics season opened on the last Wednesday\nof last term when the I.C.3 miles Championship was held\nin the Wimbledon Park track. Guilds had the first four\nmen home to so ore an easy victory in the team race from\nR.C.S. and Mines. The individual winner was John Evans\nwho beat the holder, T. Bailey, by half a lap in a time\nof 14-41.\nFour members of the Club attended the University\nTraining Week at Motspur Park during the last week of the\nva o. The energy expended on the track and in front of\nthe dart board resulted, in at least two oases of complete\nexhaustion and one pulled muscle.\nTha I.C. trials were held at Harlington on April 27th in the expected gale for oe wind which assisted the sprinters but greatly hampered the middle distance men. In\nthe sprints, fresher s Mantle and Regan both showed great\npromise and should strengthen the relay team. Of the\nother fresher s, Colraan has providentially arrived to replace John Davies in the pole vault and Hyslop should fill a long felt need in the hurdles and also take Mike Rickard's place in the high jump. Several field events man have\nyet to be seen in action and a further trial for them and\nthe sprinters is being held.\nAs a result of the U.L. trials on Saturday, two I.C. runners will travel to Paris with the U.L. team next week-end. The outstanding performance o a me from John Evans\nwho won the 880 yd s. in the new I.C. reo or d time of 1-56-8\nand will run the 800 m. in Paris. In the 2 miles, Trevor\nBailey was well below his last season's form in taking 3rd pla oe, but will travel to Paris as 2nd string for the 3000\nm. Of the o th a r.I.C. representatives, Gordon Stewart was\n6th in the 880 yd s. in a personal be3t time and Buiny Snellook cleared 5'4\" in the high jump and was 6th in the tri ple jump.\nOn the same day a rather inexperienced I.C. team took\npart in a4 X3, miles road relay at Potters Bar and finished:\n14th.' RoyMaular recorded a promising time of 15-13 on the\nlast leg.' '\n\u2022\n\u00bb\nCROSS COUNTRY CLUB JOIN THE BEAGLES\nOn the Saturday before the term started a small\nband of I.C.o ross country members, donned in tweeds\nand armed with shooting sticks, travelled down into the\ncounty of Sussex to partake in the open event at the annual Point to Point held by the Brighton and Storrington\nFoot Beagles. The cattle of Stuocles Farm had kindly\nvacated their stables, for the afternoon, providing roomy\nbut somewhat odi fe rous changing accommodation.\nThe afternoon started with the local Point to Point\nclubs going twice round a1 mile specially prepared oi rou it, over obstacles and across a rather infuriating\nwater jump with a steep landing bank. Rather more interest was aroused by the installation of a1 lap ladies\nrao e, the ladies receiving encouraging support from the\nI.C. members.\nThe open event (of w hio hI. C. were the holders) had\nbeen increased to four laps, and it was this plus a lack\nOf fitness after the Easter recess that took heavy toll\non the I.C. team. Many were the tales told afterwards\nof the water jump and of the spectators who assembled\nthere. One country gentry was reported to have laughed\nso mu oh at D. Inman's effort to extricate himself from\nthe mud that he fell off his shooting stick into the\nstream.\nApart from I.C.'s rather poor showing, D.J. Pain running as an individual won the open event, with a fine run,\nand mention must be-made of Oldfield who completed the\nlast two miles barefooted having lost his shoes in the\nwater jump.\nPublished by the FELIX BOARD, Imperial College Union, London, S.W.7.

The race\nwas rowed in conditions which varied from one extreme\nto the other, the earlier crews starting in a near\nblizzard with snow, high wind and rough water, and the\nlater crews ro vd n^ over in warm sunshine with a gentle\nbreeze ruffling the surface of the Thames.\nI.C. entered nine crews, thus tieing with London\nand Thames for the largest entry out of a total of 227.\nThe 1st. VIII surprised and disappointed by dropping\nin position from 8th. to 14th., a place which, though\nit fairly reflects the crew's performance on the day,\n.is in no way an assessment of its potenti lit y. For the rest the Club did very well. The 2nd. VIII\ndid extremely well to finish 20th.( from 27th.), fulfilling a three year ambition to finish in the 1st. Division. The 3rd. VIII went up from 79th. pla oe to\n64th., and the 5th. and 6th. VIIIs rose respectively\n35 and 63 places on last year's positions. All this\nhelped to raise the Club's average by 15 places a crew!\n. The results show parti cul rly a very keen and\nable bunch of Freshers, many of whom are rw o ing through\nthe Summer Term; and the Club looks forward to an\nenjoyable regatta season.\nW.U. S.

There will be no I.C. float in this\nProcession, although the Mines Traction Engine might make\na good entry as a specimen of the Industrial Revolution?\nA University Carnival will be held in Bedford College grounds during the afternoon and in the evening there\nwill be a Grand Ball to o lose the day.\nSparkes Cup: R.C.S.9 Guilds 3.\nR.C.S. won the Sparkes Cup for the fourth time in\nsix years by following up their 8-5 win over Mines by a surprise vio tory over the Guilds.\nGuilds played with a strong wind in the first half,\nbut failed to use it. The score was 3-3 at half-time,\nand R.C.S. thereafter kept Guilds pegged back with kicks\nby Holman and Shepherd. They added to J. H.

The cricket season opened quietly, the first trials\nbeing held on the beach at Falmouth during the Rugger\nClub tour. Here K. Weale was seen to be in his usual\nform, but more talent was forthcoming from the later tri als at Harlington.\nThe 1st XI played Reading University, who won the\ntoss and batted first. They displayed considerable con-cent ration, but little initiative, and I.C., despite poor\nfielding, had a good chance to win when Reading declared\nat 142 - 6 (Jordinson 4-27). By way of contrast the\nI.C, batsmen showed lack of concentration and occasional\nreckless initiative against indifferent bowling. They\nlost 4 quick wickets, after wh i oh the later batsmen did\nnot experience much difficulty in forcing a draw at 82 -7 (Whiddon 34).\nThe 2nd XI, thanks nain ly to a fine 59 not out by\nRegan and 5 for 45 by Amatya, scored an exciting one wicket victory over Reading 2nd XI.\nThe Sunday XI began with a fine win over Lennox, who\nmade 140 - 7 dec. I.C. passed this total with several\nwickets to spare, Kitchener (87 not out) astonishing those\nwho had come solely to barrack, notably W.S. Robinson.\nThe Golf Club has continued its successful season\nby defeating King's College Hospital 5-1 and Middlesex\nHospital 4-2. As Middlesex are the present University\nchampions I.C. should stand a good chance of winning the\nchampionship when it is played at Koor Park on May 25th. An innovation at the end of last term was the dinner\nheld in the Upper Dining Hall. The guests included the\nU.L. Captain, the Captain and Secretary of Highgate and\nBill Cox, who, as one of the leading teachers of the game\nafterwards showed an extremely interesting film, several\nmembers taking the opportunity to discuss their failings\nand pet theories with him. >\nThe standard of play at the Spring Meeting held at\nWalton Heath on March 25th was adversely affected by the\nhard winter, most members being out of practice. The\nscratch cup was won by M. Hampton with a79 and D.D. Anderton won the Glover Cup for tho best handicap round.\nThe foursomes competition in the afternoon was won by K. Lewis and A.P. MacKenzie. Hampton followed up this success during the vacation in the Northern Open Championship\nat Murcar, when he had a72 hole aggregate of 295 to finish second amateur in a field containing 58 amateurs with\nhandicaps less than 4, and several professionals. He\nwas 8th in the overall placings.\nThe term was given a good start when 12 members and\nex-members opened the weekend of April 22nd at the Dormy\nHouse at Corden Beach, Bexhill. The golf gradually deteriorated as the week-end progressed. In fact, more than\na few people had difficulty in driving straight on the Sunday morning! Those who had any energy left on Sunday evening used it up by pushing one of the cars up and down the\nroad for an hour before it would start. The weekend was\nan outstanding success and it is to be hoped that many more\nwill follow.\n\n"

We ate,however,\nshocked to read of the lack of good fellowship amongst\nthe men of I.C. To our memory the destruction of decorations at carnivals and hurling of trifle (however\ngrim it might be') was not considered to be funny.\nWe would heartily support Mike Neale in his contention that there is a distinction between free and\neasy enjoyment and irresponsibility. One of the objects\nof Varsity life is to breed gentlemen in the fullest\nsense of the word. Whilst this does not preclude jocular high spirits the line is drawn at hooliganism.\nFurther, dishonesty, though disguised as cleverness is not \"a good thing\" (S. Potter).

HOCKEY CLUB TOUR NETHERLANDS during EASTER\nWIN S DRAW2 \u2022 LOSE - I The party of sixteen left the Union on Saturday March\n26th feeling rather depressed at the pros p eot of not being\npresent at the \"Ceremonial Closing of the Bar* but such\nthoughts soon vanished and Rotterdam was reached on Sunday\nmorning without loss of life. The day was spent in general sightseeing and liqueur tasting and in the late afternoon we travelled to Delft where our hosts were waiting to\nguide us to the \"Sooietet Phoenix\". Here, the serious business of drinking (Jenever) began but dinner interrupted\nbefore long to the ao comp anime nt of beer only. Two short\nand reasonably coherent speeches were made during the Dinner after which coffee and more Jenever were taken. The\nteam then departed with their hosts homeward and after several beers in the favourite \"locals\", retired to bed.\nAfter some sightseeing the following morning we travelled by tram to the Sportsgrouad, the other side of the\nHague where I.C.A3 a beet Delft 2nd XI by 5-0. After\nthe match we saw something of tha Hague including some exotic night o lub s and finally we returned to the'Phoenix\nfor a last drink,\nFUN IN DELFT\nMore wanderings round Delft on Tuesday morning and\nthen by oo a oh to the ground where I. C.1st XI lost 3-4 to\nDelft tat XI in a very dose and exciting game. This was\na very good result as Delft run seven regular Hockey sides\nand are considered one of the beat clubs in Holland. The\ncoming evening was to provide tha most spectacular events\nduring our stay in Delft. Serious drinking began at 5.30\np.m. and was taken so seriously by some members of I. C,B.C. that they did not last beyond 7.00 p.m. and thus sds sad tha Dinner. At the Dinner, the Captain of I.C.H. C. ia\nalleged to have delivered two semi-intelligible speeches:\nthe only certain thing however was that Mr. J. W.C. Sherwood was duly congratulated on the attainment of bis Nth\nbirthday and he replied (although somewhat reluctantly).\nAfter the dinner, complete chaos set in and the details\nof what occurred thenceforth are clear to no-one.\nTha true magnitude of the event could only be Judged\nfrom the sordid aftermath, visible the following morning.\nIt was with very sad hearts and very many Alka-Seltsers\nthat wa departed from Delft the next day for Utrecht.\nWIN IN UTRECHT\nWe played our match against Utrecht en arrival and\nconsidering the general physical condition of ear players,\nwe played with some spirit to win 1-0. After the game\nwe returned to the Utrecht Student Society where a very\nlarge number of us drank Lemonade. At this stage of tha\ntour, at least two members of the Party had sworn never\nto drink Jenever again neither did they for the rest of\nthe tour. At the dinner, besides tha usual speeches, the\nUtrecht President called upon Edwin Owen to explain how\nha had come to be the only go also or er of the day; from\nthe reply one could only o ono lude that it was a matter of\npare oha no e that he had not scored at least five mora goals]\nBecause of the International Trade Fair then In progress\nIn Utrecht, the night-life was somewhat brighter than usual.\nWHO DONE IT? I? YOU LISTENED TO PROFESSOR A. E. RICHARDSON MACTKt\nBIS PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS AT TIB ROYAL ACADEMY DINNER JEM\nDAT3 AGO, YOU WOULD REMEMBER THAT HE DTD HOT RATS \"MODERN\nART* VERY HIGHLY. Perhaps tha pae pla who chose tha colour son\u2014n in the new Bar had some vague notion of \"modern\nart\".\nTe rate it even lower than Professor Richardson.\nOn entering the Bar, wa are now confronted with tha\noil lio us contrast \u00b0fro ee pink doors and lemon-yellow walla.\nWho chose the o ol our so he ma? The patrons disapprove vehemently and surely it is the patrons who matter.\nIs it too mu oh to ask for an attractive Bar? la it too mu oh to want to quaff our noggin in genial, not austere,\nsurroundings?\nThe answer would seem to be i52_ MUTUA FIDES IN GRON/NGEN\nThe next day we moved on to Groningen where we had\na comparatively quiet evening in MUTUA FIDES, their Student Society. We drank some beer and talked a while\nwith our hosts. The following morning we toured the\ncity of Groningen and saw the University and other build-in gs. After lunching with our hosts we made towards the\nSportsfield where I.C.A XI played extremely well to beat\nForward 2nd XI 6-1. There followed in the evening another general orgy of drinking and eating with I.C. perhaps a trifle more restrained than on Tuesday in Delft.\nSo enjoyable was the entertainment that all were oblivious of the fact that on the morrow, we were to have our\nmost arduous day's hookey. The oe leb rations continued\nwell into the morning and the I.C. Captain left lu tua Fides in disgust at 3.33 a.m. having been so intent on\ntalking that he had missed a round of oha mp agne: Jim\nTaylor did not have this misfortune. The following morning was taken up with shopping and general wanderings\nthrough the town. John Taylor tried very hard to make\nintelligent conversation with the Assistant Professor of\nPhysios on the topic of Theoretical Metal-Physios and\nwith some suo o ess considering the hour.of the morning.\ncon td. on page 2. col 2.\nAn E.NEMY HATH DONE THIS iHI NG BY V \u00a3R \u00a3 ATKINSON\nThere would, appear to.have 'been ao ert a ln amount\nof weeping and gn ssW ng, of teeth among the union of late.\n\"Who.has perpetrated this outrage?\" they cry, slavering\nvisibly for blood. They refer, of course, to the temporary Bar.\nBow did this calamity occur? The original odour\nscheme waa yellow walla and tan woodwork- bright, but\nreasonable. Unfortunately, while the woodwork was being\npainted, various dignitaries of the oo lle ge strode onto .\nthe aeons of tha crime and, after an initial period of\nspa a eh la a an s a a, expounded at great length on tha nasty\nthings of wh i oh they were put in sand by the odour of\nthe paint.Th* painters, all very sensitive men, could\nnot help overhearing and ware shortly reduced to a state\nef nervous twitch. This culminated in them bounding away'\nfata their paint pots and pouring lot a of red and blue\npigment into their tan paint. The result was the horrid\ndash we new have between pu oe pink doors and lemon walla.\n\u2022Why*,growl the affronted drinkers, unmoved by'this\ntale of human perfidy, \"why o odd we not have had a temporary with soothing dull ore am walla and a murky brown\ndado like our dd one?\"\nTho cataclysm originated In the thought that as a new\nunion i a in construction some gui dan oe as to ita internal\ncolouring would be required. Hitherto the Union had been\nclad uniformly in a drab brown and ore am. Was this institutional odour ing really the students' idea of pleasant\ncolouring? Or was it merely the result of a wartime\nshortage whan only these colours ware available ? To\nascertain the current student's taste we ventured to\norder brighter colours \"for those temporary rooms being\nrepainted. They are the Registry Lounge and Games Hall in tha Bait n\"^<\"a and the Notioeboard Room and Bar in the\nUnion.

    "content": "FELIX3 Felix THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE\nEDITOR: P.A.E. SOUJHGATE Circulation 1200\nlike many people, the closing of the Union has\nbrought home to us the shook of living in the kitchen\nwhilst the builders are in the dining room. But there\nisn't really any excuse for the deplorable decoration\nin the temporary new Bar. In soo iet yo i roles it would\nbe called the height of bad taste; in dock land it'sab \u2014 \u2014 eyesore.\nBut quite apart from this travers it y of art, this\nsacr l lig io us mockery of a university 'pub, it is impossible to pla oe a dartboard anywhere without the risk of\nremoving someone's eye as he enters the Bar, and yet again,\nthe watering place has room for no more than three standing and one sitting - totally inadequate on crowded nights.\nThere is but a single word of praise. The designer\nhas foreseen the need of ventilation - and a fan blows a soft breath through the Bar - perhaps to ooo l down the anger of its patrons in this inhospitable pla oe. 'The P3LIX printer3'11 Vous Plait Ltd. has\nhow moved premises from South Kensington to 307A, Telephone Plaoe, Fulham. 'Phone; FUL5179 (see\nsketch below)\nWe are indebted to them for providing FELIX\nwith a new set of boards and various printed\nheadlines wh i oh will give additional clarity to\nour college newspaper.\nWe should like to remind Clubs and Societies\nthat S'il Vous Plait have printed many of our\ndance and carnival tickets in the past and are\nalways pleased to receive your enquiries.\nSHi.KansinQton \u2022\nOld Brompto.TR< j___ frg j*30,74<3 vs7< \u00bb\n.\n3\n0\n307a., Telephone Place- WK\u00bb\nNelson's Column Continued:I. C.W. A. DIHNBR AND DANCE: - in the Ayrton Hall last Fri day. Both the food and the speeches were given a good re-ce pti on. Toasts were proposed by the Rector and Dr.Owen,\nPeggy Taylor and 'Ida Hayton also spoke. The guest of\nhonour was Dr. Panston, Principal of Bedford. Dancing\nlasted until 2 o 'clock after wh i oh coffee and breakfast\nparties lasted until dawn.\nEASTER BALL Over 400 attended what must have been one of\nthe most enjoyable functions of the College year.\nClaridge's certainly lived up to its name J The\nBuffet was a sight to be believed, much to the\ninternal discomfort of those who had partaken of\ntl x Kooney's excellent Hall Dinner beforehand. The\nstaff were working overtime serving delicious\ngate aux, fruit salad and literally gallons of\nio\u00abd orangeade, t ne latter to the pecuniary d is advantage of tue waiters, one of whom was heard\nto remark \"They come here all night and all they\ncan do is drink orangeade\" \u2014 This was no\ndoubt the outcome of end of term student finance\nrather than a mass signing of the pledge)\nThe Curzon Orchestra played non-stop dance\nmusic and a Piper provided Eightsomes and Gay\nGordons. Mike Neale gave an address of welcome\nand bouquets were presented to Mrs. Linstead and\nPeggy Taylor by members of I. C.W. A. Tnere was no cabaret officially engaged but\nmany enjoyed the antics of numerous painters on\nscaffolding and nigh ladders who could be seen\ndecorating an adjacent lounge I The only adverse criticism heard concerned\nthe seating accommodation w n ich was unfortunately\nlimited until12 o 'clock. However for the rest\nof the night an extensive and luxurious\nlounge was made available and the grumbles were\n30on forgotten.\n*** MINES TRACTION ENGINE: By now all at\nI.C. should be familiar with the R. S.H. mascot. At their last Union meeting,\nlast term, the Uines tried to decide on\na name for her. There were several suggestions, some of these being variations\non the name of the only lady member of\nthe Union, one being the name of a fossil and also \"Clementine\". The last was the\nmost popular, and those who have done\nmost work on the engine prefer it. There\nis a snag, however, the name \"Clementine\"\nwas first suggested by an R.C.S. man, in print too. If only he had had the decency\nto keep quiet and let the slower thinking\nMiners arrive at this most appropriate\nappellation themselves.\n*** R.C.S. MASCOT ? Whilst on the subject of mascots\nthat move, a fat little bird told Nelson that R.C.S are acquiring an ancient fire engine from the regions of Warrington, but as the present owner e will require the machine for a procession this summer,\nthe scientists will have to walk for a while.\n**\u00bb MINES PORNOGRAPHER: Another news item from the last Uines Union meeting - somebody had the nerve to\npropose the abolishment of this important post, and\nthere was even some serious discussion on the sub-j ect. To show that only a few have been softened\nby female presence, \"the boys\" rejected the motion\nwith contempt.\n*** LORD MAYOR'S SHOW - A FLOAT FOR C&G: Martin Jacobs sub-committee met on the 22nd. of March and\nvarious ideas for a theme were discussed. The best\nwas forwarded to the organisers of the show this\nyear. The sub-committee hopes to have everything\ncut and dried before July, so that Guildsmen can\nstart building the float as soon as possible in October. One of the chief difficulties has been\nthe selection of a suitable site for the const ruc tion, and, as yet, no final decision has been\nmade.\n**# ELECTION - VOTING BY POST': At the last Council\nmeeting I.C. was dissociated from all politics. An I.C. political society which wanted to circulate I.C. voters with information as to how\nthey could vote (for any party) by post , cannot\nnow do so. Detail so an, however be obtained from,\nthe Union Offioes,\n*** NEWS FLASH FROM CORNWALL: 'HAG' Slater just can't be kept out of this column. A second year meta ll ur gist, living in Cornwall, was walking on a hillside with his sister when in the distance he\nperceived Hags, dark and stormy having just been\non the wrong side of a rugby victory. He pointed\nout Hags to his sister who observed:\" What a peculiar man, but he looks about forty.\"\n*** STOCKPILING OF HOCK ? There is to be no beer but\nwine at the next Hall Dinner on May 10$h. Someone\nprobably considers that this move will introduce\nthe uncouth to the art of better living. We wonder\nwhose taste everyone will have to endure.\n*** FEMALE MUSCLE AT HARLINGTON: Officials are urgent-ly required for the first athletics match ever\nundertaken by I. C.W. A., at Harlington against King's tomorrow. Applicants should form a queue outside\nthe door of Maureen Hawes' room, No.66 in the New\nHostel.\n#** OVERHEARD AT SILWOOD: At Sunday breakfast at the\nlast Touchstone weekend, Mr. UcDowall, our General\nStudies Administrator, was heard to say:\"I want to\nbe a sex maniac.\" He was in fact telling a story\nabout a little boy,an avid reader of horror comics,\nwho was asked what he wanted to be when he grew up.\nNEWSPAPER STRIKE: We understand that a certain well\nknown gentleman of I.C. made money during the stoppage by selling duplicated sheets of racing results\nfor asp iv in the Strand. Helping to sell2000 in one hour, he earned ten shillings.*** YOU WILL BE ABLE TO QUENCH A RED HOT POKER IN\nYOUR GLASS OF STOUT in the new bar now being\nbuilt in the Union. There should be a coal fire there - all being well.\n\u00bb** TOLD BY DR.WILLIS JACKSON AT THE RADIO SOC. DINNER:\n\"One of my colleagues\", said the doctor,\"made a glaring faux pas at a public school presentation.\nBe came to the awards for cricket and said:'I now\npresent the Smith cricket cup to Jones Major for\nthe best performance; and bails to the rest of the\nteam.\"\n\n"
