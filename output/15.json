    "content": "FELIX LETTERS TO\nTHB EDITOR\nREFECTORY LOSSES\n9th November, 1950.\nSir - Hay I, through your paper, address four questions to the Refectory Committee?\n(a) Do special dinners(i.e. club, Hall dinners,\netc.) pay their way?\n(b) How many people are employed by the Refectory\nand how are they distributed?\n(c) Does the Refectory pay rent, gas, and electricity bills, water rates etc?( d) Are provisions bought wholesale and at competitive prices? Have we a competent and economical buyer?\nPerhaps the answers to these questions will\nhelp us to understand why the Refectory has made\nsuch a heavy loss during this last year.\nYours faithfully, Peter Rowe.\nThe Refectory Committee write (Nov. 15, 1950);-The answers to Mr. Rowe's questions are briefly\nas follows:-(a) The prices charged for \"special\" dinners cover\nthe cost of food and overtime wages. If the Refectory is to pay its way, however, the food must not\ncost more than half the price charged. In the past\nthe cost of food has been nearer 75% of this price.\n(b) The total staff is at present 45, distributed\nas follows:- (i) management 4, (ii) Kitchen 14,\n( iii) lower Dining Hall 12, (iv) Upper Dining Hall\n8, (v) Snack Bar 7-(c) Yes, a composite charge of \u00a31,100 is made for\n\"overheads\" (which includes gas, light, water, heat,\n\u2022tc.) ;\n(d) Yes, and the buying is continuously under review by the Manageress and Chef, both of whom have\nlong experience and useful contacts.\nIt may be noted that two firms of catering eon-tractors, who recently investigated our buying and\nstaffing systems, were both of them unable to suggest any but marginal alterations (most of which have\nsince been adopted).\nYours etc., J. F. Levy.\n(Deputy Chairman, Refectory Committee\nDINNER IN HALL\n28th Nov.,1950.\nSir 7 Dinner in hall serves a very useful purpose in bringing together members of the College Staff and\nstudents, who would not otherwise meet one another.\nThe time has come to enforce dinner in hall for\nevery member of I.e.a certain number of times each\nsession. Dinner in Hall shou ls be served in Upper\nHall for, say, 3/- every night of the week except\nSaturdays and Sundays and those nights on which Club\nDinners are held. Allowing for 4 nights a week, 30\nweeks a session and 1500 members of I.e., every mem ber could attend 6 hall dinners a year without making it necessary for more than 100 to attend any ev-e ning. We feel that to ask everyone to attend 6\ntimes a session, and to be charged irrespective of\nhis attendance would be acceptable to students and\nen for cable by the College Authorities.\nB.J. Swain, G.H. Morrell, G.P. Gilbert,\nC.D. Allen, S.J. Williams.\nSir - After going to Dinner in Hall on Tuesday 5th December, I should like to make three suggestions\nto the organisers of the Dinners.\n(1) That College Societies, such as the Musical\nSociety last Tuesday and the Social Clubs Committee\non the 12th December, should not be allowed to swamp a Hall Dinner. If they wish to hold a Dinner\nof their own they are, presumably, perfectly at liberty to do so, but for 8o members.of one Society to\ncome en masse destroys one of the a ims of the institution,, to enable people of differing opinions to\ncome into contact with one another.\n(2) That members of Staff attending should be put\nupon their honour not to \"talk shop\" at the Hall.\n(3) That, in any event, the number going to the\nHall Dinner should be restricted to, say, 60 people,\nso that the numbers may be manageable.\nYours truly, Polypheme.\nFAVOURITISM IN THE REFECTORY\n7th Dec. ,1950.\nSir - Why is it that at a recent refectory supper\nonly S. Coppelman was served with boiled snail?\nMany amon ji us would appreciate this rare delicacy,\nand I trust that your journal will use its influence to combat unfair discrimination of this kind.\nYours e te.,'l a dig nant Diner'\nPROFILE SANTA CLAUS\nDo you believe in Father Christmas? You, who have\ncast off the cloak of adolescence - have you also\ndiscarded your cynical disbelief in this most real\nof personalities?\nThe real Santa Claus must not be confused with\nthe fabulous red-coated, reindeer-drawn-sledge-driver,\nthe darling of Victorian romanticism, the joy of\nchildhood days. This conception probably came to\nEngland from Germany about the time when our ties\nwith that country were particularly close. The\ninfluence of 'Punch' and Victorian family life did\nthe rest; and, before the close of the last century\nthe white bearded, generous old chap we all remember\nwas as firmly established in England as the Albert\nMemorial.\nBut the real Santa Claus was no myth. No snow-fields for him. No sledges or reindeer. Saint\nNicholas was born at the end of the third century,\nin blue-skied Lycia, beneath a Mediterranean sun.\nPrecocious and pious at early age, he grew up to be\nan amiable sort of fellow; an ascetic, but not un-possessed of that streak of earthiness so necessary\nto the churchmen of those days. He became Thaumaturge (archbishop) of Myra, was a member of the Counc il of Nicea and performed sufficient generous and\nsaintly acts to be eventually canonized. His most\nremarkable fact seems to have been the restoration\nto life of three children who had been regrettably\ncut mp in pieces and placed in salting jars. For\nthis miraculous affair he is remembered as the patron saint of children and paupers.\nIn 1087 some merchants removed his supposed remains from the cathedral at Myra and re-interred them\nin the church of San Nicola at Bari, in southern Italy. To that pleasant town on the Adriatic seaboard\nthousands of pilgrims come each year to do him homage\nand receive from the 'Manna of St. Nicholas'. His\ngenerosity lives om: to pilgrims he dispenses cures\nfor all ills and to children at Christmas time he has\ncome to be regarded as the bounteous filler of stock-in gs. The earthy side of his nature is presumably responsible for his being also the patron saint of rogues\nof pawnbrokers, thieves, vagabonds, Russia, judges\nand murderers; and, not least, he is the patron saint\nof scholars, so that no freshman hoping for a first, or a third year man praying for a pass can afford to\nne glee t him.\nLUNCH-HOUR CONCERTS\nC&G BOARD ROOM 115 THURSDAYS\nII JAN FIRST THURSDAY OF TERM\nALAN LOVEDAY TRIO\nIN A BRAHMS PROGRAMME\nBEAVER CLUB\n9th Dec.,1950.\nSir - We wish to bring to the notice of all eligible\nmembers that the BEAVER CLUB is now fully grown (see\nForthcoming Events).\nIt shows good promise of being an excellent\nphilanthropic, philosophic, philatelic, philological\nand glass-phil ling society.\nYour loving phil tre, Phil.

CUP HOCKEY 3RD ROUND\nImperial College 7> Kings 0\nThe I.C. team, full of potentialities, has not\nshown very impressive form in the. first two rounds\nof the University Cup . In this match, however,\nthey played as a team, and strafed their way into\nthe semifinal. The key to their success was quick\nand accurate passing in mid-field and in front of\nthe goal.\nThe play for the first15 minutes was even, hut\nseveral piercing movements by I.C. marked them as\nthe more dangerous side. Green made two or three\ngood runs on the left wing, and put a hard shot in\nfrom ah acute angle: the force of the shot carried\nit off the goalkeepers pads into the goal. Jones\nfollowed this with a clever piece of reversed stick\nwork, resulting in a second goal.\nAfter half time I.C. ran away with the game.\nJustessen and Hart at full back were too fast in defence to let the opposing forwards have more than\nan occasional look at our circle. Good thrust ful supporting play by the halves and Waterland at left\nwing, led to goals by Jones, Power, Bennet and Bentley. Jones got a third by an almost solo run from\nthe bully. Bentley, profiting by loose marking ,\nran rings round the Kings defence and played a large\npart in this convincing victory.\nJ. McC.\nPLUM PUDDING EIGHTS\nin\nAs it was dusk by the time the crews competing\nthe Plum Pudding Eights finished the four mile\ncourse, the positions of the four I.C. crews was\nnot clear. However, it is known that the first VIII\ndid not do as well as e:pe c ted. It is hoped that\nthey will have a better row when they meet Reading\nUniversity next term.\nCROSS-COUNTRY CUP\nJudging from the performance of the team against Woodford Green the preceding week, I.C. had a good\nchance of regaining the Cup they lost last year - al though Kings were very hot favourites.\nThe course this year was 4 ust over 5H miles,\nand during the race proved to be very heavy going -conditions were not helped by a persistent drizzling\nrain.\nThe race itself proved to be a triumph fox Tea\nWhitfock, of I.e., who won the rae e quite easily,some\n200 yards ahead of his nearest rival, 11.G. Barrett of\nBattersea Poly., in the excellent time of 28 minutes.\n13 seconds. Unfortunately however, he was not backed up hy the remainder of the team, and though packing 5 men in the first17 home, I.C. were again run-ner s up for the title, this year to Kings, by 58 pts.\nto 46. It is gratifying to note that we were well\nclear of the third team home - who registered well\nover 100 pts.\nIndividual I.C. order:-(1) E.f. Whittock R.S. M.;(2)M. Garrod B.

Six-a side competition vr as won at Motspur Park on Saturday Dec. 9th by Westminster 'A'. The Kings 'A', the runners-up, earned the biggest\ncheer of the day when they ousted U.C.' A' with 5\nU.L. players in the semi-final. Scoring is by\npoints, 4 for a goal and 1 for a corner.\nI.C. entered four teams, of these the B and C teams both performed very creditably. The A VI\nprovided one of the biggest shocks of the; afternoon\nwhen, after a bye in the preliminary round, th'ey\nwent out in the 1st round to Westminster 'B' by 5\npoints to 4.

'A1\n.\nI.C.'C was the most successful of our teams,\nbeating Battersea !\nA'81 in the prelim, round,and\nChelsea 'B'130, in the 1st round, before falling\nto Kings 'A' by 20-8 in the 2nd round. Goals against Battersea were scored by Buckroyd, helped by\nan opponent's foot and by Hailing; by Manson and\nThompson(2) against Chelsea; and by Thompson(2) in\nthe final game.\nI.C.'D' had the double misfortune of being\ndrawn against Westminster 'A' in the prelim, round\nand of playing a man short, Webb taken ill at the\nlast moment and his substitute apparently losing\nhis sense of direction.

Badminton Club, starting the year with three of\nthe previous year's players, and strengthened by F.5 Lau, Open Champion of France,started its winter on\nNov. 19th with a match against Oxford University II\nteam.\nOxford sustained an overwhelming defeat, losing\n6-0 in the double and 6-0 in the single, I.C. dropping only one game in the entire match.\nThe team have been invited to Oxford for a return match early next year.\nImperial College v. Cambridge.\nOn Sunday Nov. 26th I.C. lost to Cambridge University\nII by 4 games to 5- Since this team, which included\n2 members of Cambridge I had previously defeated London University II, I.C., playing without F.S.

They show dd superior tact-ics, and were extended once only to 3 sets.\nThe third pair, Reed and Paige, played well individually but owing to extremely poor coordination,,\nand inability to smash decisively, lost all three ga-mes.\nThe match was one of the hardest played at I.C., and it is hoped to reverse the score in February,\nwhen the team visits Cambridge.\nNETBALL\nThe womens Netball team have had a rather mixed\nrecord to date but at long last, they have vindicated their honour. Last Friday they drew 10-10\nwith a rug ger club side. The next day, Saturday\nDee. y th the j defeated Bedford I by 15-9. This\nis the first time that they have beaten Bedford\nfor the past three years. It was obvious to all who watched the game that the team has greatly im-proved, and that if they maintain this form they\nshould give a good account of themselves next term\nwhen their fixtures include matches against Q.M. C., Kings, Royal Holloway, and the Inter Collegiate\nRally.\nPrinted by THE FIGARO PRESS Ltd. 97 Moore Park Road, London, S.W.6. "

He was activated by self-preservation and\ninterest, rather than by the lofty motives of an\nidealist.\nFor four glorious nights, after surviving the\nHades of Miners' Night, the LUDS entertained us\nwith a superb,-if somewhat overacted, melodrama,\nagainst which the original Shaw lacked lustre. No\nsooner had the curtain gone up than '\nwe were captivated by Beryl Bailey's bouncing brows and were\nheld spellbound by these active accessories to the\nend; while to those not given to falling in love\nwith the heroine at first sight was the compensation of Eaina's confident ability and nice sense\nof timing. Clifford Hose gave a complete and sincere port ay al of the most lovable 'Chocolate Cream\nSoldier', adeptly serious with himself while laughing at everyone else.\nThe rest of the highly commendable cast played\nwell and amusingly together. How we hated the obsequious Nikola; though he must learn what a butler\ndoes with his hands; pitied the muddle-headed Petkoff, and guffawed at the drollery of Sergius, that\nbewildered victim of love. Miss Morgan made a very solicitous mother, but must be more subtle in her change of expression, while Miss Edwards flirted\nconvincingly when she forgot her otherwise woodenly\nforward pose.\nThe interest of the audience was so held that\nnot one in ten could say what scenery there was; but\nit was such that it blended well with the spirit of\nthe performance.\nThank you, LUDS, for a most exciting production.\n(An appraisal of the production has already appeared\nin 'University'; a further critique will appear in\nthe next Phoenix, published at the beginning of next\nterm).\nMINES DANCE\nBegun three years ago as an experiment, the Mines1\nDance soon established itself as an annual Event;\na social Occasion at which students and staff could\nmeet and air their dinner jackets, and introduce\ntheir guests into the friendly atmosphere of the\nEoyal School of Mines.\nThis year's Dance, held on \u00a5/ed nes day6 th, was\nno exception to the usual high standard. After the\nusual initial difficulty in p rising couples away from\nthe f ire in the entrance hall and persuading them\nthat the gym was quite warm really, things went with\na swing. Our thanks are due to the refectory for an\nexcellent Buffet, the bar for the excellent beer, and\nto J. Mackay and his helpers, to whom the smooth running of the evening and the seasonal decoration of the\nhall were due.\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE CHESS CLUB\nMATCH RESULTS: Played, 8; Won, 7; Lost, 1.\nINDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIP CUP 1949-50: Won by Julian\nCook (HCS, Physics P.~G.) who is this year's University Chess Captain.\nLIGHTNING TOURNAMENT: Tie for first place between\nM.J.

This was the orchestra's debut,\nand a very successful debut it was. In spite of\nthe fuga l nature of the music, it was played with\nconfidence by every member. The strings are inclined to falter during soft passages, but as a whole the orchestra is a very competent body and\nthe audience was favourably impressed.\nEdward Byles, tenor, then sang an aria by Floto* and \"The Flaxenheaded Plough-boy\", the latter\npleasing the audience immensely. David Ward,bass,\nsang songs by Ireland and Stanford and then gave a very fine rendering of \"Die Beiden Grenadieren\".\nIn both cases the accompanist was Eric Brown who\ncannot be too highly praised.\nThe main work, \"Acis and Galatea\", followed,\nwith Angela Rasting,Beryl Holly, Edward Byles and\nDavid Ward (from the R.C.M.), and the I.C. Choir\nand Orchestra(leader H.R. Allen), conducted by John\nClements. The quality of the performance showed\nthat much time and practice had been expended on\nrehearsals, the singing of the choir being of a very\nhigh standard. The rd le of Galatea was shared by\nthe two sopranos and, although this was probably\nnecessary, it was a little unfortunate. Edward\nByles is a tenor who i3 very lyrical for Handel,\nbut this proved to be a good thing in view of the\npastoral nature of the. music, and the aria he sang\nin the second part received a large ovation. Ward,\nas Polypheme, was excellent throughout.\nThanks are due to John Clements for giving us\nso much of his valuable time, and to the organising\ngenius of the choir, D.M. Tombs.\nDIVIDED LOYALTIES\nTo the Sports Editor. 7th Dec. 1950-Dear Sir,\nI cannot agree that the existence of University\nsports teams seriously weakens college clubs: especially to the extent of affecting their fixture lists. The fact is that individual college clubs have not\nthe strength ana resources to attain and maintain\nfirst-class standards in any branch of sport. \"Good\"\nand \"bad\" years follow one another.\nBut the University, drawing from all the colleges, can and should field first-class teams to which\nabove-average players may aspire. Such teams attract into the college sides players who would otherwise join outside clubs, and are a source of strength\nand not of weakness to the colleges.\nThe University has achieved first-cx as s status\nin the more individualistic sports, e.g. athletics\nand swimming, and is approaching it in others such as\nhockey, soccer and rugby. The progress made is a result of keen college support, which in turn confirm\nthat the above viewpoint is widely accepted and is no\nlonger a subject of acute controversy.\nThe division of loyalties within I.C, has been\nresolved in a number of cases by the virtual disappearance of the constituent college clubs, except for\ntheir annual inter-college contests. I imagine that\nyou refer not to these but to others, notably the rug\nby club, in which such a sweeping solution has not\nbeen attempted and is not desirable. The rugby club\nhas however arrived at a very reasonable compromise,\nwhich is working well; and will work better as the\ncollege secretaries are able to make their strongest\nfixtures in the second term. There is little doubt\nthat an arrangement by which I.C.'s constituent colleges recognise the prior claims of the University and\nfor one term only, of the I.C.l st XV, provides a basis on which complete and mutually satisfactory cooperation is possible.\nYours etc., K.

The play had a normal audience on the other four nights and a critique appears\non another page.\nMINES NIGHT\nAlthough it must have been embarrassing for a lady to find 200 Miners and gentlemen in her bed ro om, Raina was soon reassured by the audience's bedside manner and the hisses that greeted the appearance of Bluntschli must have finally convinced her\nthat her virtue was safe in their hands. Indeed,\nthe frequent use of bad language shocked the Mines\nwho also thought that the joke about \"a pet What?\"\nwas rather close Shavian. Altogether the first\nact was a good example of what a Mines' night should\nbe.\nHowever the standard fell during the second act.\nThere was some good witticisms, notably when Sergius\nappeared looking as if he had come straight for the\nbedroom scene, while the audience was suitably intrigued when Nicola almost exposed what the butler saw.\nUnfortunately most of the act res aem bled a Peace Conference. When, in the final scene, the actors began quarrelling, a cry from the back threatening the\nuse of -the atom bomb broke off all diplomatic relations and the res Be mb lance was completed.\nAs a whole the night must be regarded as a fail ure. It is a pity that L.U.D. S., being our guests\nfor the first time, should have been introduced to\nthe R.S. M. through a per fo as man ce definitely below\nthe traditional standard. The idea of a Mines' night is to comment on the lines, not drown them, and\nin past years the Miners have \u00abnui red a reputation\nfor knowing when to keep their mouths shut, as well\nas when to open them. The reputation must have been\nbadly damaged on the Tuesday.\nIf only Shaw were alive now, it would kill him.\nHEARD IN A52 BUS\nShe: (noticing scaffolding opposite the Albert Hall)\n\"What's that, 'en ry?\" He: \"Beh lass, that's a statue to Victoria or sum-mat like that.\"\nShe: (after a contemplative pause) \"Aye, I reckon\nit' ll be nice when it's finished.\"\nStealth.\nOut into the night to steal he stole,\nHis bag of chink it chunk,\nAnd many a secret smile he s mole And many a wink he wu nk.

    "content": "FELIX EDITORIAL\nDINNER IN HALL\nWe regard Dinner in Hall as a very sound\ninstitution: not only does it provide us with\ngas tron or r.lc al pleasure at reasonable cost, but\nalso with a not too formal 'occasion' on which\nwe can meet new faces and an excellent opportunity to entertain guests in an atmosphere quite\ndifferent from the hurried clatter of the Lower\nHall. It enables us also to meet members of the\nstaff and talk with them on a more human level,\nwhich Is perhaps the most important function of\nDinner in Hall in a mainly non-residential college.\nA few facts and figures may be of interest.\nThis term there have been nine Hall Dinners, at\nthe average attendance nas u een as follows:\nStaff - 15.6, Students - 17.S, Guests - 18.2.\nThe fact immediately emerges that proportionately\nfewer students than staff use the facilities afforded by Tuesday Dinners in the Upper Hall. This\nis a pity, but we are the losers if we do not take\nadvantage of these occasions. One fact which is\nnot evident from the figures is that of the 155\nstudents and 1S5 members of staff who dine i in Hall\nthis term, many were present on more than one occ-as ion, so that there remains an enormous number of\nboth students and staff who have never been to Hall \u2022\nDinner. One of our letters on the page opposite\nsuggests that dining in Hall should be obligatory\nto students once or twice each term.\nSurely people \u00a3ou ld afford an extra pound\nau ring the year for six good dinners; but one\nwonders if enforced attendance would be desirable\nor even practicable. In this connection it is interesting to note that at most Cambridge colleges\nundergraduates (even those living in lodgings) are\nallowed to dine out of college only once during the\nweek.\nThe I.C. Centenary Fund at present provides a small subsidy to ensure that Hall Dinners pay their\nmay as far as the Refectory is concerned. That\nbeing so, we evidently get good value for money and,\nas students,we should require no further stimulus\nto make the most of Dinner in Kail.\nUNIVERSITY Mr. P.T. Walker of Chem.

A. Saunders delighted a large audience, nominally of the Radio\nSociety, with a lecture on \"Magic\". He was lecturing without the small clock that is a feature of\nhis other spare time lectures and which his audience had been hoping to see disappear in a puff of\nsmoke, and it may have been the absence of this mascot that made his lecture less weighty than witty.\nHe dismissed as idle the speculations that he\nhad been invited to give this lecture because electricians could only regard the doings of mechanical\nengineers as magic, and also that they merely wished\nto know how to pass exams. After a brief history\nof the origins of magic, and hinting that many old\nsuperstitions may be quite reasonable, he went on to\ngive his views on modern conjuring - although he warned us that as a member of the Magic Circle he was\nnot allowed to give away any secrets, so that anything he said should be taken with pinch of salt.\nThe Indian rope trick he considered quite feasible; with a native audience, the sun in the right\nplace, a bit of trickery, mass hypnotism and the aid\nof an agile small boy, it was quite possible to make\nan audience think they had seen something unnatural.\nWalking on fire he thought was principally an example of the control of the mind over the body, and sword swallowing was just a matter of practice, though\nhe did not know how one started; however, he recommended it as vocation for our children in these days of\nincreasing Government restriction.\nAs regards modern conjuring tricks, the Dean considered that their merit was in inverse proportion\nto the amount of mechanical apparatus required, holding that elaborate contrivances were more a credit to\ntheir designers than to their operators, whereas tricks with billiard balls and cards were a pleasure even for other magicians to watch - unless they were\nplaying on the other side. He emphasized the need\nfor a sensitive touch, in conjuring as well as in\ndealing with fathers, quoting as an example the removal of a man's braces without his knowledge -\"de-bagging de luxe\". In spite of his Union rules, he\ngave a useful hint on techique: a slap on one part\nof a person's anatomy, will make them forget what\nthe other hand is doing elsewhere. It seems that\nall is fair in conjuring, also.However, the illusion\nwhich most appealed to his audience was that of sawing a woman in half; not only is lady a contortionist but she and the box can be hired at a reasonable\nrate.\nAfter stressing the need for a steady stream of\nwitticisms to accompany the act, Prof. Saunders ended his lecture with the exhortation: \"Roll up and\njoin the ranks of the wizards, and under the spell\nof a cat's whisker put an end to examination blues!\"\nIn the carefully prepared demonstration which he was\nreluctantly persuaded to give after the lecture,he\nperformed two tricks: a very skilful piece of card\npassing from the pocket of one gentleman to another,\nand a thought-reading act with his secretary, Miss\nMargaret Haley. (The implications of this are sha-tte ring). Naturally, everyone afterwards \"knew how\nit was done, old boy\", but few managed tc. agree; in\nspite of his lecture everyone was looking at the wrong thing at the wrong time - No, not you, Margaret,\nsit down!.\nJOYS OF SPRING\nFELIX prints below an extract from 'A Mathemati cal Treatise on Vibrations in Railway Bridges' by\nCE.Inglis, which is quoted in Timoshenko & Young'Advanced Dynamics'. It is rumoured that attendance next term at lectures on railway bridges may\nhave to be restricted to bona-fide students of civ-il engineering.\n\"...In this behaviour of the spring supported\nmass, there is something almost human; it objects\nto being rushed. If coaxed gently and not hurried\ntoo much, it responds with perfect docility but if urged to bestir itself at more than its normal gait\nit exhibits a mulish perversity of disposition.\nSuch movement as it makes under this compulsion is always in a retro gade direction, and the more it is rushed the less it condescends to move. On the\nother hand if it is stimulated with its own natural inborn frequency, it plays up with an exuberance\nof spirit which may be very em baras s lng.\" MARCH OF TIME ,\nThe Dean of the City and Guilds College is anxious\nto trace the stranger who walked into the Guilds\nMech. Lab. having mistaken it for the Science Museum. After inspecting the machinery, he left, re-marking: \"They don't seem to have any modern stuff\nhere\n\"' <u&>~ "
