    "content": "m Letters \\\nA to the\n1 Editor\nDeal Mail,\nIn his last editorial your predecessor called attention to\nsome ol the things he had never got around lo. among them an article on College owned Hals: \" yon know, the\nones they don' l tell students\nabout, leave vacant for ages,\nthen move in some College person lor -a lew weeks.' on a need basis.\" II there is any doubt 1 welcome the op port unity to dispel il. There are several categories\nof College owned accommodation. Most of it is allocated to students. There are a few\nHats set aside for postgraduate married students, a number for academic visitors and College stall and some, because of\nstatutory provisions, are currently occupied by protected tenants. The College will, however, repossess the Hats in this category when the leases\nend. The total stock and its use\nis subject to change as the College does its best to acquire more accommodation for stu-dents. This session there are\nadditional permanent places\navailable both at Sil wood Park and at South Kensington and Iam grateful to all concerned for accepting the concept of loan finance and the\nhardships it imposes.\nIn Halls and Houses, war dens, sub wardens and hall bursars are provided with accommodation. The merging of\nSouthside Halls has made two more Oats available for stud ents. Be it. Garden and Weeks Halls each have guest\nrooms available for short stay\nvisitors. There are also two\nguest rooms in8 Princes G dns and one in170 Queens Gate. The guest rooms in Halls are\nbooked through wardens and the others through the Boo kings Office.\nSome College stall'have Hats\non the premises because the\nnature of their work requires\nthat they live in: the Rector has a Hat in 170 Queens Gate, the Refectory Manager, the\nDomestic Manager, the Domestic Superintendent, the Assistant Domestic Super in ten dent and the Sports Centre Superintendent all have Hats\nin Princes G dns. There are\ntwo small Hats in Beit Quad for\nrefectory stall and a barman and a gardener have Hats in\nEvelyn G dns. There is accommodation in the Health Centre for nursing stall and one Hat in the Biochemistry Department. The Athletic Ground Manager has a Hat at\nH arlington, a ncl certain stall\nat Sil wood Park arc expected\nto live in College accommodation. Each time a stall te nant vacates a College Hat the\nfuture use of the Hat is reconsidered. Recent decisions have\nusually been against allocating such accommodation to\nstall members again. There are currently ten Hats\nfor Academic Visitors: in5253 Princes Gate,170 Queens Gate, Princes Gate Mews and elsewhere. They are let up to a maximum of one year. Economic rents, which are regularly reviewed, are paid and everything is done to prevent voids,\nalthough the turnover of tenants is deliberately high. These Hats are an important asset. Without them many visitors who contribute to the\nacademic life of the College would be unable to come. The Hats are also occasionally let\non a temporary basis to new members of stall Who are coming to London for the first time.\nApart from the student Hats\nin Robert Pryor House,9 Princes G dns and next to the\nBoathouse at Putney, there are\nlive College owned flats set aside for married post-graduate students. Four are in Evelyn G dns, and one is in Princes G dns. There are also\nfour Head Tenancy flats set\naside for this purpose. Three are adjacent to the Fulham Palace Road( Lamb rook Ter race and Woodlawn Rd) and one is at Shepherds Bush. These are all allocated by the\nStudent Services Office. There are plans to increase the num ber of Hats for married post-graduate students as funds bec ome available to convert College owned houses in Princes( i dns and as protected tenants\ndepart.\nThe administration of acc om mod ation has cert a ihl v had its shortcomings, but during last session changes were\nmade in order to try to in crease the stock, to improve allocation, to ensure a steady\nturnover of tenants and to\nachieve rent income at a level\nwhich permits improvements. There are. of course, still cli lli cult ics but no l all ol these are\nof the College's making. Ten ants (stall, students and vis i tors) may leave Hats in a mess,\nfail to pay rent or even refuse\nto go; where the Hat is an isolated unit it is all the more difficult to maintain effective\ncontrol. 'The biggest difficulty\nis one none ol us can do anything about. The College is in\none ol the most expensive residential areas in London, as a glance in an yes tale agents\nwindow will confirm. We can never hope to satisfy the dem and to house everyone both\nnearby and at a low cost. But I promise you that we will do\nour best both to increase the\ns lock and to manage il ell ce live lv.1 nn11\\\\ IIIIi rely\nJohn Smith, College Secretary Sir .\nAs an ex IC student, mavI thankyou for informing me of\nJohn Smith's bemusing letter\nand allowing me the op port unity to reply.\nJohn Smith CBE, College Secretary and author of Hmc to\nmile tellers and get results, seems\nto have applied the technique ol \" bore the enemy stiff with reams and reams of useless and irrelevant facts such that the\npoint to be answered is lost\nbeneatha morass ol ceaseless\nbenevolence.'' My. how the\nCollege provides for its stu-dents! 'This was never a point\nof con tension in my original article. Quite simply, there are\nHats that are owned b v the\nCollege, reserved for College stall, not students, that are left\nunoccupied for long periods of time, often as long as five\nyears.\nAs John Smith must surely\nrealise, a list of College acc om mod ation and occupants is of no interest whatsoever.\nAnd substantial space devoted to such drivel in FELIX is un likely to \" dispel any doubt\". Without reiterating my original article, I would merely ask Mr Smith how he intends\nto combat, for instance, the\nawfully embarrassing' re fec tory Hat' in the Union Building that has been empty and un advertised to the homeless,\nnot to mention those currently in the Crash Pad. for the past\nlive years.\nCut the crap.

Late in the year 1588, Sir Francis Drake, after finishing his game of bowls, set sail on\nhis historic conquest of the\nSpanish Armada. Sir Francis knew before his excursion that\nhe had the time to finish his\nbowls, as history has proven. Mr Gould er seems to doubt my ability to plan things this\ncarefully . I feel he must be\nunaware that the order for\nconstruction work on the Lower Lounge partition was\nwithheld until the last possible\nmoment in order that the maximum time lor consider ation was available. Indeed. I first started discussing ideas for\nthe lounge in early July, with the College Estates section as\nwell as with the Union Executive and as many interested\npersons as I could. I must however agree with Mr Gould er about the ludicrously high price of the parti tion, but what choice was\nthere? The Union can only instigate work of this nature with the approval of the Estates\nSection, who will only accept\n\" reliable\",\" trusted\" contra c tors.\nI call upon Mr Gould er to\nwrite with mein opposing the\nEstates' control of these matters, and working towards bei ng able to spend our money with a certain degree of cost\neffectiveness.

Despite the jeers from the tired old\nhacks of the fac...(sorry Conservative) and\nMar...(sorry Labour) parties, in six months the\nSDP has achieved a position which ensures\nthat it will form the government after the next\nelection. Who would have thought in March\nthat Roy Jenkins would gain over forty percent\nof the vote in Labour's fiftieth safest seat?\nUnder successive governments since the\nend of the war we have suffered an economic\ncollapse which makes Ireland and Italy look\npositively flourishing. We have had governments that have stifled individual initiative\neither by excessive centralisation (Labour) or\nby helping big business to the exclusion of\nsmall businessmen( Conservative),( cf S. Williams \"Politics is for People\"). But there is no\npoint in crying over spilt milk.\nA measure of a country's stagnation may be\ntaken as what event in the past do people refer\nto as a watershed in their lives. In France it is\nthe events of 1968, in the United States it is the\nVietnam War, and so on. We are one of the\nvery few countries whose people refer, as I did\nearlier, to the end of the second world war\nfrom which modern dates are taken. An event\nover a generation ago is still very much with\nus. This strikes me as the most compelling\nevidence that this country has stagnated.\nWe must break out of the straightjacket of\nthe two party system which has ruled us. They\nhave failed utterly and completely. We need\nreform like that which we had in the 1830s: of\nthe constitution, of the voting system, of the\neconomic and industrial structure. Only the\nSDP can carry this out because all the other\nparties have vested interests which cannot\npermit them to carry out policies of reform.\nDavid Owen is coming on Tuesday, October\n13 to speak in the Great Hall on the SDP. To all of you, especially fresher s,I appeal to you to\ncome and listen to him; to discover whether or\nnot you are satisfied with the present system,\nand, if you are not, to help change it to build a better country.\nFrank James\nH.G. Wells Society\nDon't miss Eric Laithwaite's lecture to the H.G Wells Society on Monday, October 12, at\n6:15pm in Mech Eng 220 on Facts and Fallacies\nin Science.\nAssistant Sub-Warden\nTizard Hall\nApplications are invited for a post of assistant\nsub-warden in Tizard Hall for the academic\nyear 1981/2. Rent free accommodation in a single room will be provided. Tizard Hall will\nhave approximately 94 men and 24 women\nresidents and the duties of the assistant sub-wardens are to help the warden and sub-warden with the day-to-day organisation of\nthe Hall and to contribute to its social life.\nBoth female and male students of Imperial\nCollege are invited to apply and although the\nsuccessful applicant would normally be a postgraduate, applications from others will be\nconsidered on their merits.\nApplications with a curriculum vitae and\nnames of College referees if possible should\nbe sent to Dr M.

    "content": "\"Experiment is always right,\nthe theory never!\"\nFELIX talked to Professor Eric Laithwiate, who will give the first\nH.G. Wells Society lecture of the year on Monday evening.\nI'd like to start oil by asking you a little\nabout your background, Prolessor. Was\nthere any particular event which got you\ninterested in science and engineering in\nparticular?\nIt's not so much an 'event', it's the people\nyou come across on your journey that influence you. I was blessed with a very good physics master at school. I think I can place\nit back to then. Plus I had parents who were\ninterested in things of that nature; my father\nwas a farmer you see, but he retired early.\nHe should have been an engineer, he would have made a very good one.\nDid you live in an industrial area?\nYes, but not one directly connected with\nwhat I do now. I was brought up in a small\ncotton weaving town, it was an industrial\nvillage if you like, but I wasn't involved in the\ncotton industry.\nDid you have any hobbies as a child?\nI had all sorts of hobbies as a child. I went to\nsecondary school in the ordinary way so I played cricket and rugby football and things that one does at school. Plus I played\nguitar, I had a pop group in the 1930s, which was ahead of its time! I 've collected butterflies and moths ever since I could walk I finished up writing a book on it. You've got\nto get your money back somehow, you see!\nDid you go straight to university to study\nengineering?\nNoI left school to join the airforce in 1939\nwhen I was18. It was during the airforce\nyears, I suppose, I really decided that it was\nengineering I wanted to do, because at\nschool they never told me about engineer-ing. In those days they never had careers\nmasters like they do now. I would have been\nin the civil service if it wasn't for the war,\npushing a pen.\nWhat did you do during the war?\nI started as an instrument bas her, of which there is nothing lower, and graduated to get\na commission in 1943 and ended up at the\nexperimental station at R.A. Farnborough which is where the interest really began and all sorts of exciting things went on there,\nespecially during wartime. I got a class five\nrelease in 1946 to go and become an undergraduate at the age of 25 in Manchester,\nand did a masters degree and then got a staff appointment and was assistant lecturer for four years. I was then senior\nlecturer and after that got the appointment\nhere.\nI'm sure things will have changed since\nyour freshman days, but is there any advice\nthat you might give to fresher s? It hasn't changed as you might think. The purpose of university is to have your mind\ntrained. It's never been any different since\nSocrates and it doesn't much matter what\nyou get it trained in. Some of our graduates\nare managers of Marks and Spencers, on\nthe other hand, you've got people doing\ngood engineering with Arts degrees. If you get your mind trained it doesn't really\nmatter what it's trained in so long as it's versatile. You've got to come to university\nwith an open mind. It isn't like what it was at school. Ohm's Law isn't true. You've got to\nkeep an open mind; you've got to discover a new way of thinking of things every day. I'd advise people to broaden their horizons\nand, of course, discuss things amongst\nthemselves; this is what a group of people is\nall about anyway. You will get quite a lot\nfrom each other, quite apart from the formal\nlectures.\nOn to your position, which is Professor of\nHeavy Electrical Engineering. Could you\nexplain that a little?\nWell heavy simply means the generation of\nelectrical energy in quantity, in thousands\nof megawatts at a time. A Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering is conscious of heat engines and thermodynamics and engineering in its broadest and heaviest sense.\nYou're famous for your work on the linear\ninduction motor, but has it developed as\nquickly as you expected?\nIt might have developed more rapidly than\nyou thought. The thing is that people identify linear motors with high speed transport.\nWell, there's a lot more to linear motors than\nhigh speed transport. We've sold millions of\npounds worth of linear motors a year for\nseveral years and listed 1,000 different applications to industry, none of which are\nhigh speed transport. The big money spi nner now is a scrap sorter, sorting aluminium scrap from copper, brass and iron scrap\nfrom stone, metal and crushed up motor\ncars in general. That's a very big money\nspinner. We haven't really begun \u2014 just scratched the surface that' sall.E very generation thinks it's got there but it hasn't./ remember you saying once, on Multicoloured Swap Shop in fact, \"Never mind if\nyou don't understand the theory, just have a go at using it.\"\nMaking it useful is what engineering is all\nabout\nWhat do you think of pure science?\nPure science is a luxury and always has\nbeen, full stop. There's those who think\nabout the origin of the Universe and may be\nso misguided \u2014 because it may never have\nhad one! It pre-supposes it had one. Extrapolation is not valid. You can see that the\nearth had a beginning and how it might\nhave an end, we know all of us might have a beginning and an end. You cant extrapolate and say the universe had a beginning and an end, it might not have.\nEric Laithwaite is Professor of He au y Electrical\nEngineering at Imperial College. He is undoubtedly the father of the linear induction motor in\nits modern form and is well-known for demonstrating the unusual properties of gyroscopes.\nIs this your personal philosophy?\nI'd call it commonsense! When you are dealing with your engineer-ing, is it the application and experiment.\nExperiment is a/ ways right, the theory never! Experiment rules.\nOn Monday you will be giving the\ninaugural lecture for the H.G. Wells\nSociety, of which you are President. Have\nyou any surprises in store for us?\nOh yes. Things that I hope people will say\n\" Why didn't you teach us that at school?\" I 've lectured the society before on four or\nfive occasions. In its greater days the first\ntime I gave one I was told how fortunate I was to be asked to lecture to the society!\nThere are those today who kindly say how fortunate they are forme to do their lectures\u2014neither is correct I hasten to add. We are fellow students in a common cause.\nI never want to be any different.\nI understand that the point of the society is\nto celebrate the life and works of H.G. Wells and to pursue matters that Wells\nmight have been interested in. Is there\nanything that you particularly would like\ndone by the society?\nYes, I think they ought not to be afraid of\ndabbling in such things as ESP.A friend\nand colleague of mine who is my counterpart at City University is Arthur Ellison and he is President for the society of psychic research. The society must get Arthur along to do a talk on ESP.( Ed's note:\nArthur Ellison will be lecturing a week.on\nMonday (unknown at the time ol the\ninterview).)\nAnd finally, what about Professor Laithwaite? Will you ever retire?\nI never want to retire. Anyone who is a true\nacademic will never retire \u2014 he stops thinking. I want to do a Barnes Wallace designing continental airliners into my nineties.\nThank you very much Professor Laithwaite.\nFELIX, October 9, 1981 Page 5\n\n"

For those\nwho have somehow passed us by or\nhaven't yet realised the full range of\nfacilities available, here is a breakdown of\nwhat we cover:\nCollege Accommodation\nApplication and billing for all the College\naccommodation allocated to students\nbegins with us, including a limited number\nof flats for families.\nPrivate Sector Accommodation\nWe have details of many types of accommodation currently available. Most of\nthese are in West London, some are close\nto College, while we occassionally get\noddities like an attic on the Isle of Dogs or\na yacht in St. Catherine's Dock. If you feel\nin need of a change of abode during the\nyear, come along often enough and just\nwhat you are looking for may turn up. If not\nour Accommodation Guide lists some\nagencies that have proved helpful in the\npast. It also contains information on some\nof the legal aspects of being a tenant.\nWhich brings me on to\nLegal Advice\nThis includes all kinds of legal problems\nfrom traffic offences to making claims\nunder the small claims procedure in the\ncounty court.\nIn certain cases where you may have to\nhave a solicitor, as for example, you would\nif you wanted someone to represent you in\na magistrates court, we have lists of\nsolicitors who do legal aid work\u2014which is\nfree if your income is low enough \u2014\ntogether with the areas of the law that they\nspecialise in. These lists also note\nsolicitors who speak languages other than\nEnglish.\nLandlord Problems\nThese can be many and varied. One of the\nproblems is knowing just what your rights\nare. Other problems, such as an imminent\nbreakdown in the relationship between\ntenant and landlord, may be helped\nthrough an intermediary such as our-selves.\nConsumer Rights\nLegislation over the last few years has\ngiven the consumer considerable pro-tec tion. However, it is still up to the\nindividual to find out how he stands in any\ntransaction that appears to have gone\nwrong, and summon up enough energy to\ncommence battle l This is where we can\nprovide reinforcements with advice and\nsometimes direct intervention when\nappropriate.\nImmigration/Home Office Problems\nThis is an area which may require the skills\nof specialist organisations or solicitors\nwhich we can put you in touch with,\nalthough for routine enquiries we should\nbe able to provide most of the answers.\nInsurance\nWe have quite a selection of leaflets on\nmany types of insurance, including bicycles, personal, possessions and\nholidays.\nCovenants\nHere is a useful way of supplementing your\nincome by reclaiming tax paid by your\nparents on their contribution to your grant.\nForms explaining the procedure are\navailable from Student Services.\nBenefits\nWe have most of the relevant Department\nof Health and Social Security leaflets, such\nas those on all aspects of the NHS( including medical treatment abroad),\nNational Insurance contributions, unemployment benefit and rent allowance schemes.\nGrants\nHelp with chasing up recalcitrant LEAs.\nadvice on eligibility for grants, details of\ncertain discretionary allowances and lists\nof educational charities can be provided\nMiscellaneous\nThis includes such things as reference\nbooks on holiday jobs and working holidays, while we also aim to act as\nintermediaries between those looking for\ntutoring work and those in need of\ntutoring.\nIf there's anything else you need,\ninformation on topics not mentioned here,\ncome and see us in the Student Services\nOffice. If we cant help, there s always out\nbook of useful phone nun:be rs Sue To,ling\nEXEC VIEWS\nI am sure that the first years amongst you were a little overawed by the\nFreshers' Reception on Monday. You probably also found Freshers' Fair\nreally hectic and how about those first lectures? Because of all that goes\non in the first week of term and as a reminder for second and third years I shall go over the impression we were trying to create at the Reception.\nThe people in this Union Office are really quite human and very keen\nto help you. The three sabbatical officers are all students who went\nthrough the same processing and settling in when they first came to\nCollege. The three permanent staff in the office, Jen, Jo and Pat, are\ncharming and knowledgable. Please feel at home in this office and come\nup here if you have any problems or queries.\nWe should be able to advise on any College related problem (and a few\noutside College). If you are having difficulties with your course and want\nhelp come and see us. If you want to complain about a member of staff or\nwarden or any College employee come and see us. Similarly if you want\nto complain about a service offered by College come and see us. If you\nwant to complain about a Union Officer come and see me. And if you\nwant to complain about me, go and see Barney. Of course if you have\nanything pleasant to tell us we want to hear that too.\nThe Union has officers to help with academic affairs, welfare, Rag and\nall the clubs and societies. Make use of them, they all promised so much\nwhen they stood for election.\nAs far as Barney, Marco and myself are concerned, grab us in the office,\nin our rooms (we all live in College residence) or in the street. I suppose I had better add what all Presidents say, you can sometimes catch us in the\nbar.\nSo have a good year at IC. Work hard but enjoy yourselves.\nNick\nDuplicating Demo\nIf you would like to learn how to use the geste t ner duplicating machine\nand be put on the duplicating list then come to the Union Office at\n12:30pm on Tuesday, October13 for a demonstration. All publicity\nofficers should make a special effort to attend.\nPage 4 FELIX, October 9, 1981\n\n"

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nLamps Stolen\nFrom Bo\nFour brass lamps worth in the region of \u00a3500 were\nstolen from Boanerges, the City and Guilds Union\nmotorised mascot, at some time between 5:00pm last\nTuesday evening and 9:00am on Wednesday morning.\nThe Bod river, Chris Ro lp hs of Me chEng3, arrived at the\nBo garage at 9 : 1 5 am Wednesday morning to discover that the\ndoor was open. He had locked it the previous evening at about5:00 pm, following Fresher s' Fair, and soon discovered that the\ntwo rear lamps and two of the four front lamps were missing. Subsequently he noticed that the acetylene generator which fuelled the lamps had also been stolen.

The lights are of the same vintage as Bo,a1902 James and Browne, and their value was the subject of a discussion Mr Ro lp hs had with a friend at Tuesday's Fresher s' Fair.

Raise \"The Titanic\"!\nFELIX has received several complaints about the state\nof the new Hall in Montpelier Street.

    "content": "Rent Reduction\n(.(U)h mu(l j ii u ii front ft ft ge for Residents?\nThe origins of ibis article stem from the disappointment of a considerable number of Montepelier residents ;\\t the state of their\n\" home\" and \"place ol study\" for at least the coming academic year.\nHowever it is considered that i he condition of this Hall of Residence\na i fords mention if only lo bring to the attention ol non-MontpClicr\nresidents the condition which the occupants arc basing to endure.\nAs reported in the previous edit on of FELIX the Hall is designed to\nhouse 84 postgraduate students, mostly in single rooms, although\naccommodation for married couples is also provided. The Hall is very\nconvenient for College and also for various shopping needs.\nThe single rooms in the Halls are. on the whole, very small. In a number of cases desks have, as yet, not been provided and no specific\ndate has been given as to when they can be expected. Indeed, in certain\ninstances it seems very difficult to imagine how desks will be\naccommodated within the rooms as space is extremely limited. In l act the space limitation has prompted a number ol the residents lo start\nreferring to their rooms as \"pigeonholes\".\nAlthough the lights work in all the rooms none of them have any\nelectricity sockets so that equipment such as bills, lamps, etc., cannot\nbe used.\nThe heating in the rooms is also ot a defunct nature, in that although\nvarious reports ol the Iced pipes warming slightly have been received,\nno actual eases of warm radiators have been known.\nSince Montpclicr Street is a self-catering hall, kitchens are provided\nso that residents may prepare their own food. However, this seemingly\nsimple operation bad been hindered by a lew minor setbacks such as\nthe absence ol a gas supply for the cookers. However, when the supply\nis restored the idea ol twenty people having to share two cookers does\nnot seem very inviting. Electric kettles have as yet not materialise d so\nthat the preparation of hot thinks has became exceedingly difficult.\nResidents were informed that there would be laundry facilities in the\nbasement, but these have not vet been provided. A common room was\nalso anticipated, bin this has not been completed either. Until recently\nsome ol the toilets and bathrooms were devoid ol doors causing an\nunderstandable degree ol \"discomfort\" to users of these facilities. These\nhave now been provided.\nThe geographical location ol the Hall( just oil Brompton Rd) and\nabout a minutes walk from Harrods adds to the prestige ol the Hall and\npresumably the rent. This /J23pw. in other words ( lor all its\ndeficiencies) is more expensive than the Southside Halls.\nThe residents of the Hall are a very friendly group of people and in\nall fairness it must be said that when the renovation ol the Hall is\nfinally completed it will be a most enjoyable place to reside. However,\nthis stage ol completion is no l anticipated in the immediate future.\nl 'lie Hall, although as yet nameless, has attracted a varied selection\nol nicknames ol which the most popular is \" The Titanic\". Although il\nsurely gives the residents no pleasure to use ibis name, il does seem to\nsum up the lee ling of discontent about the slate of ibis Hall ol\nResidence.\nIt is realised that the Hall has just recently been acquired by\nImperial College and so teething problems were inevitable and indeed\nanticipated. However, there is a strong lee ling among certain residents\nthai I he rent ol j \u00a323pw is too high for the services being provided al\npresent. Many lee l that a reduction in the rent until al least i be lime\nwhen the Hall is hilly renovated would be appropriate.\nthe first number to spring to\nthe intrepid\" conquerors\" \u2014\n1588 pounds! As to Mr Gould er's comparison of the rather un imposing room divider to the Berlin Wall I must emphasise that,\nunlike the latter, the lounge\npartition( or should I say\" Gould er's importunity\"?) was not built overnight, but took seven days of careful craftsmanship to emerge, solid, yet sympathetic to its\nsurroundings, a monument lo his year serving on the Union House Committee.)

Life will soon return to\nnormal, so don't worry.\nBoanerges\nThe theft of four brass lamps from Bo, the\nmito rise d mascot of City and Guilds Union, is\na sad and extremely tragic loss. If anyone does\nknow anything about the incident then please\ncome forward and contact Andy Rushton,\nGuilds President, on 589-5111 ext 1044 or\ninternal 2378. These items are not replaceable\nand Guilds are only concerned for their safe\nreturn.\nThe Name Game continues\nAlthough I 've been living in Southside since\nJuly I'm still not quite sure what to call the Hall\nI live in. Being under the impression that\nTizard and Selkirk Halls were combined at the\nend of the last session, I toyed with \"Tizkirk\"\nor \"Selard\" for a while. However, Warden\nHenry Hutchinson informs me that the two\nHalls will be deliberately kept separate and\nhave individual social lives and Hall com-mitte es, etc. This, of course, means that we\nSelkirk residents may continue to sneer at\nthose awful Tizard people through the locked\ninter-connecting door (surely a fire-risk!).\nLooking down, on the other hand, (as we\nSelkirkians often do) to the lower half of\nSouthside,1 see that the Warden has\ncompletely integrated the two Halls, and will\nhence re-name it \"Faleogh\" and \"Kenmouth\"\nvery shortly. How confusing!\nHalls of Hall Hall\nI received a few interesting names for the new\nresidence in Montpelier Street. It was\nsuggested that Hall Hall would only be\nappropriate if Beit Warden, Chris Halls, was\nappointed as num ero uno in the Knightsbridge\ndomicile. Horticultural Hall was a tribute to\nour own dear Rector, as (presumably) was\nToad Hall. Full marks for confusion value\ngoes t to Albert Hall and the only serious\nsuggestion was Wells Hall (an excellent choice\nin my opinion).\nMind you, considering the current state of\nthe building (with a definite lack of electrical\npower causing annoyance) perhaps we should\ncall it Bugger 'all!\nMy Thanks to\nMartin, Eddie (the new boy!), Dave, Steve,\nS.J., Mike, Alan, Maz and Ian.\nmmm t Those of you who managed to get hold of a copy of the last FELIX of the summer term\nmay remember that, as usual, I set four prize\npuzzles together with a handful of 'quickies'.\nNow although( or possibly because) the\nsummer break is so long, I received NOT A SINGLE ENTRY to any of the prize puzzles.\nSince the response to the Christmas and\nEaster competitions was so good, I feel sure\nthat the main reason for the absence of entries\nwas that many regular solvers didn't get a copy\nof the summer FELIX.( You may recall we\nhad certain dist i but ion problems when four\nthousand copies of FELIX were stolen.)\nAnyway, why ever it was, I had put a hell of a lot of work into setting those puzzles, and 1\ndon't see why I should give the answers away\nwithout somebody doing some work on them;\nso unless I receive any strong complaints from\nwould be solvers who have suffered an\nagonising summer of frustration waiting for the\nsolutions, I shall reset the four prize puzzles as\nordinary weekly puzzles throughout the term.\nQuickie Solutions\nHere are the solutions to the non-prize puzzles from\nthe summer FELIX, and also last week's quickie.\n5 5 2 2 3 3 1 1\n5j522331144005544005566006666006622114433n22114433 A solution to the domino problem is shown\nin the diagram.\n9 and 9 have the property that their sum is\nthe same as their product, but with the digits\nreversed.\nThe words liquefy, rarefy, putrefy, stupefy,\nliquefaction, rarefaction, putrefaction, stupefaction, iridescent, inoculation, mars\n(=disfigures), consensus, loth (=unwilling) and\nsupersede are all spelt correctly. To his credit\nand surprise, Mark Smith was the only\nmember of the FELIX staff who knew( guessed) this.\nOf the poker hands, hand (d) is the best,\nhand (a) the worst, and hands (b) and (e) are\nequal in strength. If the hands could occur\nduring the same deal, then of course (a) would\nbe best. But as the hands cannot occur on the\nsame deal, their values must be based on their\nprobabilities of winning. Each of the full houses\ncan be beaten by the same number of fours of\na kind, but by different numbers of straight\nflushes, (a) can be beaten by 32 straight\nflushes, (d) can only be beaten by 24, and the\nothers by various numbers in between. This\naccounts for the paradox.\nAt face value,( x a)(xb)...( x z), when expanded as a polynomial has 2 2 6\nterms.
