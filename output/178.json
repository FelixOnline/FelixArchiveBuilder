No doubt, enough has been said about that\nhappy balance between work and play, both by the representatives\nof the academic side and the Union side of the College, so that\nthere is no need to add more, except to underline that the word\nbalance implies a bit of both.\nThose who are coming back to College for their second or\nthird year will no doubt notice a slight change in Felix. The\nformat is slightly different, there being four columns to a page\ninstead of three, this giving more scope in the layouts and more\nflexibility in sizes of photographs etc. The printer has also invested in a second Linotype machine, so that in the next issue\nwe will have the choice of the two type faces, namely Latin 10\npoint or Times 11 point. It is to be hoped that these changes\nwill result in an even better FELIX, which already in its pre-. vio us form was a source of envy and inspiration for some of the\nother London colleges.\nOther changes in the College scene involve the sudden disappearance of old buildings and the appearance of new ones.\nPerhaps the change which affects most people, is the shutting\ndown and demolition of Ayrton Hall. This means that One ot\nthe largest College refectories has disappeared and as a service\nto students a FELIX survey has been carried out to discover how\nthe College is going to cope with the new catering problems.

    "content": "FELIX\nCAN YOU BEAT THAT?\nImperial College has always had a fine sporting record in the\nUniversity, and usually managed to win at ew of the session's laurels, but the 1961-1962 session was a bumper year to say the\nvery least. Intercollegiate sport among the three constituent\nColleges is usually taken as an excuse for impromptu rags as for\ninstance on Morphy Day or on the occasion of the 10 Swimming\nGala (which last session resulted in a bumper crop of arrests)\nbut when it comes to UL Championships, the attitude is somewhat more serious, and as was seen last session, can be\nblessed with startling success.\nThe first big 10 success, and\nperhaps the greatest single\nachievement, was in the Hyde\nPark Eoad Belay race, held on\n'18th February. TJhis race, a yearly event organised by the\nCollege, was last won by IC in\n1949, and with names like Herb\nElliot and Tim Briault in the\nrunning, an IC victory seemed\nhardly likely. Strong running\nby the whole team, and a fan-ta stic last lap by John Cleator,\nhowever, gave IC an unexpected victory and a new record time.\nA fortnight later, the Cross\nCountry Club followed up with\na win and a new course record\nin the Culham Bond Belay, and\nthe first and second teams won\nf$i ie championships of Div.I and Div. II of the University\nLeague.\nDennis Harburn and the Soccer first XI also had a good\nseason, winning the UL Soccer\nCup for the fourth year in s uc cession, a feat equalled only by\nLSE thirty years ago. As\nHarburn put it:, 'the only record in the competition; we do\nnoi} already hold.' (they also\nwon the League championship).\nNot to be outdone, the IC XV beat the Boyal Vets, to retain\nthe Gutteridge Cup, while the\nSailing Club, not only won the\n' A' and ' B' Points but finally\nLeft to Eight:\nUniversity Jazz Cup\nGutteridt \"e Cup\nCulham Cup\nDixon Bowl (in background)\nUL Soccer Cup\nHyde Park Eoad Belay Cup\nCastaways' Cup\nmanaged to win the coveted\nand elusive Castaways Cup for\nthe first time.\nAs if all this was not enough,\nIC also won the UL Basketball\nLeague Championship and\nknockout competition, the Uni.versity Jazz Cup and the Boat\nClub brought home more bacon\nin the shape of the Dixon Bowl.\nThat was last year\u2014a convincing tale of superiority in\nthe field of University sport.\nWhat happens this year depends\nto a large extent on the support and enthusiasm of the\nfreshmen.\nHow about it IC? Can yo i beat that?\n9 \u2014\nTHE CROSSCOUNTRY CLUB ON BEN NEY IS The members of the club are\noften regarded with suspecting\nlooks when one hears that they\nrun, yes EUN5 miles or\nmore. Well how about 12\nmiles, including a climb and\ndescent of 4,400 ft., all in 2\nhours! This is just what Chris\nEvans managed, followed by\nGeorge Turner and Chris James\n(Capt.) to put IC in third\ni place in the Ben Nevis race.\nBarrow A.C. were first and\ni Lochaber, the locals, second\nwith IC close behind, out o)f i the thirty teams entered. The\nonly other university or college\ni team was St. Bart's Hospital\nwho were placed 10th despite\ni an excellent run by the UL Captain, Pete Littlewood who\nI came 12th.... The I.C. team:\u2014\n1\nCHE IS EVANS GEO E GET UE NEE1 CHE IS JAMES( Capt.)\nPETE MOSS' JOHN PEE E IBA.( three to score)\n26th in 1 hr. 59 min. 46 sees.\n. 31st in 2 hr. 1 min. 21 sees.\n33rd in 2 hr. 1 min. 49 sees.\nI59t h in 2 hr. 10 min. 47 sees.\n66thin2 hr. 14 min. 5 sees.\n) The individual winner Peter\nHall of Barrow set a new course\nI record in 1 hr. 45 min. 44 sees.\nChris Woodcock of Kings also\n\u2022 ran under IC colours just for\nthe hell of it and, despite no\n) training, managed to complete\nthe course within the standard\nI time of 3J hrs. The team had\nprior to the race spent 3 weeks\n' en holiday in Scotland doing\nsome walking and climbing.\n' It is interesting to note that\nfc last year the race stumped some\nof the College's best runners,\nI whereas this year's team are\nall second team runners.\nI Whether you run, crawl or\nclimb in competition or for en-| joy ment the IC Cross Country\nClub assures. y cu a place, so\n$ why not join the merry -band\nand see the country?\nMORHY DAY 1962\nREMEMBER REMEMBER MORPHY DAY1962!1! Perhaps it Is rather early to publish a reminder about Morphy'\nDay, but in view of the very successful Morphy Day festivities)\nof 1961, no effort should be spared to ensure that this year we\nshould have an even better turn-out.\nFor the uninitiated, Morphy\nDay is College Boat Eace Day.\nwhen the crews of the three\nconstituent Colleges battle it\nout on the Thames at Putney.\nLast year, EC S won the\ncoveted Morphy Cup leaving,\nthe Lowry Cup to Guilds, and\nthis year, no doubt, all th ue constituent Colleges are hop lr jg to do even . better.\nThe actual Boat race, how-ever, tends to be purely incidental, the masses of supporters\nlining the towpath tending to\nbe too concerned with flour-bo j mib s, eggs, rotten tomatoes\nand the opposing college's mascot to take much notice of\nwhat is going on on the river.\nLast year a six foot diameter\nrubber punch bag added greatly to the proceedings, serer a i gentlemen braving the waters\nof the Thames in order to re-t rive it when it went out of\nplay. It is about the only official Eag Day in the College\ncalendar and should not h<s missed,' It is advisable, how-ever, to turn up in rather older\nclothes, with preferably a spare pair of trousers, as these\nhave been known to get lost on\nthese occasions.\nMorphy Day usually takes^\nplace early in November, the\nfinal Order of Battle being decided at meetings of the constituent 1\nCollege Unions a short\ntime before the actual day.\nThose whom have qualms\nabout missing lectures should\ntaf re solace in the fact that\nMorphy Day is a half holi-day.\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL & GENERAL\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nDRAWING INSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1. 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7.

    "content": "- 6 FELIX\nby Colcutt\nWho is tii is blok e Chandthal? Where if he? When is\nlie coming back? Is he coming\no a ck? At the time of writing,\nonly f lie answer to the first\nquestion is known with any\ncertainty. Asit Chand'mal is\nof cours a the President of the\nUnion. He went home to India at the end of July to get\nmarried and very little has been\nheard from him since w Well\nfounded rumour has it that he\nhas not, after all, taken a wife,\ndue to difficulties in obtaining\nan export permit for her, but\nas 'o his whereabouts and ETA \u2014no one seems to know. Mnvbe he has performed the ce leb, rated Indian Rope Trick, in\nwhich case we will have to elect\nOtto Schmink to office after\nall.\nAnother question preying cn\nthe minds of many thinking\nmen around the Union is\n\"where is everyone going to eat\nwhen term starts?\" The demolition of Ayrton Hall seven\nmonths before the opening of\nthe new refectory facilities .n Prince's Gardens has severely\nreduced Mooney's Chip Bar\nservice. The increased number of students in College this\nyear will aggravate the problem\nand utter chaos is envisaged\nduring lunch break for the first\nfew weeks of term. The Col.\nleg e Authorities, clearly worried by the situation, showed\ngreat presence of mind in calling an International Congress\nof Food Science and Technology\nto find some means of feeding\n3.000 plus students using\nonly one kitchen. Fourteen hundred delegates came\nfv erm all over the world to\nIC in September and found\nout for themselves that it\nwas quite impossible to get\noui ck meals in our refectories.\nTn lias on with the College Refectory Committee, the \"Sea-food Plan\" was drawn up, Ihe\ndetails of which are given else-where. It has leaked out that\nthe Southend branch of the\nNational Federation of Winkle\nStall Proprietors hn s been iri-vite d to transfer their stalls to\nPrince Consort Road for the\n'off season'. Another part of\nthe Plan concerns Departmental\nSnack bars, and perhaps there\nwill be sales girls vend ir 'snack packs' in the aisles of\nlecture theatres between 11.00\na.m. and 3.00 p.m. The Domestic Bursar has said that the\nmatter is well in hand; Colcutt's advice, however, is that\nthe readers of this column, having been forewarned, should\npartake of large breakfasts until\nFebruary.\nAll old lags returning to Harlington this term will find a few\nchanges. The pavilion is being extended to provide fourteen new changing rooms and\nmuch improved toilet facilities.\nThe unsightly concrete huts\nand greenhouses are being removed and a hot-plate is being\ninstalled m the buffet-bar to\nensure a plentiful supply of the\never popular hot pies. Work is\nabout to begin over the road to\nprovide six new winter games\npitches which, together with the\npa villi on extension, will adequately cope with the expected\nincrease in sporting activities of\nthe expanding College. Thy\nnew changing rooms were to\nhave been built during the sum.\nmer vacation, but the work was\nheld up due to 'un for seen circumstances' and as a result\nthey will not be available for\nthe first few weeks of term.\nThe completed scheme will\nmake 'Loveday Mansions' one\nof the finest sports grounds in\nLondon, but what a pity that\nthe extensions could not have\nbeen completed in time for the\nrush at the beginning of term.\nAnother rumour!! For administrative reasons, the Geology Department (RCS) is considering a move to the Roval\nSchool of Mines. This would\nmean a switch in Union allegiance and the loss to the RCS Union of the Geology Department. Student reaction to such\na move is not yet known, but\nit is certain that it would be a sad day for R CSU if it lost its\nsmallest yet liveliest (union-wise) department,\u2014and heaven\nknows, the RCS Union is pretty\nshort of life these days.\nI hear that UL U have once\nagain sent us 3,000 Union\nCards to be written on, signed,\ncatalogued, and distributed to\nevery member o IC. This\nwould be a considerable amount\nof work for our already overworked secretary. The sole purpose of these cards is for presentation at the rare checks\nheld at the UL U door when\nthere is a suspicion that a non\nmember is going to s nie ak in\nto watch the telly on a cold\nnight. How ridiculous\u2014an\nICU membership card used to\nbe sufficient proof of membership before, so why com pci late the issue now? I understand\nthat the secretary is considering\nsending 30,000 ' iCU cards to\nUL U for distribution among\nall the members to enable them\nto come and watch nr tele vis ion. At present, the system is\nthat any University student is\nwelcome in our Union, providing that, he/she proceeds in a manner benefitting a gentleman\nlady etc. etc.\nPROFILE John Preece\nHon. Secretary of the Union\nJ,B. was born and bred in\nCheshire at a place with the\ndubious name of Clatterbridge,\nand studied at Calday Grange\nGrammar School at West\nKirby. Unfortunately, this involved a daily journey of many\nmiles, and led John to the\n\u2022shameful habit ]of getting un\nwith the birds every day. This\nsad habit has lapsed considerably over the last four years\nbu b is apparently about to be\nreinstated.\nIn 1958, John came to the\nMechanical Department, and is\nnow engaged on research in the\nCJhemjical Engineering Department. A sportsman by nature,\nhe plays soccer for the illustrious First XI and manages\nsome cricket during the sum-mer, though he prefers to -pla v for the Sunday XI where the\nEDITOR'S NOTE At the time when Colcutt\nwas composing his column, no\nnews had .been received of President Chandmal. Much to\neveryone's joy an r relief, the\ngreat man finally appeared on\nthe scene on the afternoon of\nthe 20th September, with a long\nreluctance of the Indian\nGovernment to allow him\nto leave the country. Even\nafter allowing him to return to\nEngland, they still had .the last\nword\u2014his bride of three weeks\nwas not allowed to accompany\nhim.\ngame is not so serious. His name has been associated with\na recent Preident of I CW A at\ntimes, but concrete evidence is\nslow in material is ing.A couple of years ago, when\nmaking his own beer on a hop\npicking farm, he managed to\nget himself mixed up with a big machine, and as a result,\nbecame very adept at wielding\na single knitting needle. It can\nbe s a jid that his arm is now\nmore valuable than the rest of\nhim put together.\nJohn considers the Union to\nbe the main mechanism by\nwh j ichi the College turns out\npeople of value rather than slide-rule pushers, and hopes that,\nwith the controvert i ally mined\nPresident, they may be able t q create more interest in and life\naround Union act j wi ties. APOLOGY FELIX would like to apologise\nto RCS President, Mike Harris\nfor omitting the last paragraph\nfrom the report of the ROS U Annual General Meeting published in the last issue of last\nterm, which read: \"The meeting was finally closed by a rousing Kangella inside the Guilas\nfront entrance, the party then\nleaving for the Queen's Anns '\u2022\n(Guildsmen please note.)\n\n"

The shock of joining a boys' school so upset him that\nfor the next seven years, he\nstudied hard. In his spare time\nhe won a few table tennis\ntournaments (his doubles partner is now ranked the best\nplayer in India), switched to\ntennis, then to squash, and at\nWhile few of us wish to know the future, many hope reasonably \u2014to have a hand In shaping it; and this\nrequires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But\ntraditional methods of probing the future are no longer\nIn favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.\nWitches are prophets only of ultimate doom.

But not only that. No industrial\nproject or problem stands In Isolation. Its roots rarely\nlie In industry. So, research In Unilever also means\nresearch In a number of contrasting fields\u2014detergents,\nedible fats, foods, cosmetics\u2014and it means, further,\nresearch In surface chemistry, gly ce ride chemistry,\nprotein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental\ntopics. It means a community of scientific Interest within\nUnilever, and continuity of academic contact outside it.\nIt can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction\nto the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.\nIt can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of it and\nfinancial reward in the success of it. There Is only one\nminor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.\nWe Invite you to write to Dr. A.

He met a girl in Bombay\nUniversity, courted her over\nthree continents and nine\ncountries until after seven\nyears, she could res it him no\nlonger and finally said yes.\nNot being satisfied with th*\ndegree in Mathematics that he\nwas awarded in Bombay, Asit\ncame to Imperial College several years ago, and has been\ntrying to do Mechanical Engineering ever since. He has\nspoken in a number of debates,\nand was elected President of the\nDebating Society, has also\nwritten for the college liter a rv publication PHOENIX( Two\nstories, an article, and a piece\nto be published this week).\nDuring the summer vacations\nhe hitch-hiked in Europe and\nattended student conferences\nin Vienna, Berlin (East i md West), Stuttgart, Paris and\nLondon. On three distinct oc-cas ions, he has graced the small\nscreen (!), once appearing with\na group of Asian students, once\nwhile playing cricket in East\nBerlin, . . . and the third time\nwhen IC students questioned\nMr. Grimmond on the Liberal\nParty Programme towards the\nend of last session. His crack\nabout the Liberal Party (com-pared with the Tories and Labour, the Liberals seem like u penny ha'penny trying to Le\ntwo pence') was quoted in three\nnational newspapers. With\nhis talent for a witty and balanced speech, Asit had no difficulty in leading the Guill s team to victory in the Intercollegiate Competition, and his\nspeeches at Guilds Union\nmeetings resulted in him being\nchristened 'the notorious epigram king'.\nA hard and enterprising or-gan is er, despite his literary\ntrends, Asit almost doubled the\nsales of FELIX when he took\nover as Editor in the usually\nslack summer term of last ses-sion, and by boosting advert-ising, managed to make FELIX break even, (it had been losing\nup to \u00a320 per issue). His campaign for President was\nsimilarly thorough\u2014seventeen\ncouncil members seconded him\nand there were no other can-di dates. Asit has played squash and\ntable tennis for IC and as residents of Beit Hall know, is a talented photographer.\nThe Union is in a state oi\nchange, with South Side com\ning up and old buildings being\ndemolished.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No 178 MONDAY,1 st OCTOBER19624 d.A Welcome to Freshmen\nfrom the President\nInstead of the usual 'r hub arb about apathy (of which,\nrest assured, you will hear a great deal eventually), I want\nto give you some information.\nA number of old building were\npulled down this summer,\namong them Ayrton Hall where\nthere was a big refectory. In order to compensate for this\nloss, many temporary refectories have been set up over the\nIsland Site, in addition to the\nrefectory facilities in the Union\nbuilding wh j ch will be functioning as usual. Please make\nsure that you know where\nmeals are available, otherwise\nconditions might become chao t ic. There will be plenty of notices about the place.\nThe second point concerns\nUL U cards. All members of\nImperial College are automatically members of University of\nLondon Union,, but a special\nUL U card is necessary for admission to the UL U buildings\nin Malet Street. These will be\navailable on request at the IC Union office.\nThirdly, I would urge you to\nbuy and read FELIX every\nfortnight. It is the only way of\nknowing what is going around\nIC and you will soon get the\nflavour pf IC life through the\npages of FELIX.. Tor those\nwho are interested, FELIX needs reporters and sales staff.\nExperience is unnecessary, just\nget in touch with the Editor and\noffer your services. A healthy\npress reflects a healthy Union\n(which can be taken in more\nways than one).\nAs for the rest, you will have\nheard it all at the talks given\nby the senior student officers on\nFreshers' Day, and have more\nthan enough information to\nmake a start. This is my second 'letter' to you, as I will\nhave addressed you by the time\nyou read this. It is only common courtesy to reply to let-ter s, so write to me, or come\nround and see me, even if it\nis only to say hallo.\nGood luck and good-bye till\nthen.\nThe President\nDuke of Edinburghs' Visit\nby KEITH JONES On Thursday July 12th His Royal Highnsss the Duke of\nEdinburgh visited the College to unveil a tablet to commemorate\nthe new Engineering Buildings now nearing completion on the\nisland site. The Duke was met at the main entrance of City and\nGuilds by the Chairman of the Governing Body, Sir Roger Maklns,\nand was presented to the Chairmen of the Delegacy of City and\nGuilds, and of the Development Committee, the Rector, Sir\nPatric Linstead, and the Dean of City and Guilds, professor\nO. A. Saunders.\nAfter furt rer presentation the\nparty proceeded to the entrance\nof the Mechanical Engineering\nbu jil ding where the Duke was\nfn vite d to mn veil a commemorative tablet. Replying to a comment by Sir Roger Makins\nthat this was the last time the\nold entrance to City and Guilds\nwould be used in an official oc-casio n, the Duke observed t haD this was the first time he had\nbeen called upon to preside\nover a destruction. The Rector expressed the thanks of the\nCollege to His Royal Highness\nand the party moved off across\nthe apron floor to the new Electrical Engineering block, where\nthe Duke was shown laboratories and a lecture theatre.\nThe party then passed into the\nwest block of the semi-comp-let ed Civil Engineering block,\nContinued on page 2.\n\n"

Sec. in a bit of a quandary as\nto where we can visit this\nyear).\nBob Beaumont, the Rally\nSecretary, will be organ is i ug one or two even's for the competition minded, and he will be\nable to arrange entries to the\nrallies of certain o'. her London\nclubs.\nIt remains now to remind\nyou that the first meeting will\nbe held on Friday, October 12th, at 5.15 p.m. in room 542 in E.l. block (Mechanical Engineering Department in City and\nGuilds College).

Those who do are either at the\ntop in their career s,o rar ec\non f ident ly he a de dt\nhere. THE TIMES both by its seniority in experience and by its incomparable prowess as a modern newspaper, naturally commends itself to success ful people. There is no high level conference, board meeting, no top executive's private of Ect; into which THE TIMES is not apt to be taken. This choice of a newspaper by people who get\non is indisputable.* Inw\nhi c hof the two groups do\nyou place yourself?
