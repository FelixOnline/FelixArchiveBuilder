    "content": "ENTS\nSir,\nAs members of the present I.C. Ents Committee libelled in your issue of l6 thin st, by one M.M. Fairclough, we wish to phase on record that regrettable as the failure of\nPete Nicholls is, this was due to total neglect of academic work and not to his\nseemingly magnificent master minding of Ents as reported by Mr. Pairclough. In actual*..,,-....\nfact, valuable as his contribution was, after his appointment j which was only in\nFebruary, it formed by no stretch of the imagination the bulk of Ents work, which is\nperformed \"\nby the entire committee, and is very often a thankless task.\nIn addition we wish to endorse the election of Keith Guy as chairman and the\nposition of Peter Ashcroft as treasurer. Mr, Fairclough knowledge of the internal\naffairs of Ents, both this year and last, is totally lacking and we respectfully\nsuggest the printing of only accredited facts in articles such as this in futures\"\nWe remain Sir, your obedient servants,\nNeville R.

This glowing journalism talked wild y pf what fun and how everybody-enjoyed themselves^ and....\nYou see I can say it was the most incredible act of mon debate I have ever\nwitnessed Banal, Trite, stupid. I can remember only one of the speakers names and\nthat was Rex Lowin or Lewin or something and he is, Iam quite convinced, possessed\nof a mental age of sixteen. He spoke or rather droned for what seemed hours and said\nnothing.\n- To.crown it all, it v/ as inevitably in aid of a barrel or tankard or potty full\nof beer. This fetish over drinking and the associations of manhood (eg muscles,\nbeard, masturbation etc) seems to weigh on every event that takes place at I.p. and\nis a phenomenon peculiar to it. The implication is, because there am11 enough\nwomen and because if you don't your impotence is assured you must drink and also must\nbe seen to drink preferably in excess.\nHere again this ceremonial worship of the mundane suceeded.\nS.P.

    "content": "FELIX 3 0 October 1968\nUNION MEETINGS ICU IIR.C. S.U. COMMEM DAY\nCommemoration Day happened as usual. About 700\npeople walked across the stage, much to the delight of\ntheir parents and the boredom of themselves.\nSeven eminent scientists were admitted to the fellowship of the college, their previous achievements and adventures being ably and wittily outlined by the Staff Orator,\nProf. Francis.\nThe first ICU meeting of\nthe session was held on\nThursday. Oct 17th. It\nstarted on time (!) with over\n500 people present (!!).\nDave Wield read out a letter to be sent to the Department of Education and\nScience expressing the disapproval of the Union on\nthe Government's attitude\nto students' grants. Copies\nof the letter will be distributed to year reps for everyone\nto sign.\nA letter from the Rector\nwas read explaining the rise\nin the Union fees. The\nUnion is now in a position\nto repay, within two years, a loan from the college.\nElections The election for the vacancy of floor rep on Council was next, John Hunt being proposed by Gwyn\nHughes and Chris Parker\nby Dermott Corr. After\nthe usual proposal speeches\nabout communication with\ndisinterested Union mem-be rs, John Hunt was elected\nby 234 votes to 205, with\n62 abstentions.\nThen followed the election\nof four members of the Welfare Committee, Chris Kent,\nPete Woods, Mary Ford\nand Teresa Smart and two\nmembers of the External\nAffairs Committee, Robin\nCibiee and Dave Cooper, all\nunopposed. Dave Cooper\nand Les Ebdon were elected,\nagain unopposed, to serve\non the Constitutional Reform Committee.\nCharity The election of the Carnival Charity followed. Tom\nMarples proposing Unmarried Mothers made probably\nthe most moving speech and\nstressed the need for a mere\n\u00a312.000 to save the collapse\nof the organization. As is\nnow generally known \" The\nNational Council for the\nUnmarried Mother and her\nChild \" was finally chosen as\nthis year's charity by about\n100 votes.\nQuestion time produced\nan enquiry by Dave Cooper\non the reduction in size of\nthe milk cartons sold in the\nmachines around the College. This is apparently due\nto the \" General Policy \" of\nExpress Dairies, but the\nmatter was being invest i gated.\nThe motion on proposed\nstanding orders for U.G. M's. was postponed until the next\nUnion Meeting (28th Nov.)\nto give the union members\ntime to read them. Copies\ncan be obtained from the\nUnion office.\nSen net Condemned\nAmong any other business Lilas Campion gave the\ntelephone number to be\nused by arrested I.C. students at Sunday's AntiVietnam demonstrations.\nAndy McGregor invited\nsomeone to propose a motion condemning Rennet, the\nU.L. U. newspaper for its\ninflammatory front page in\nthe issue of the 16th October. Piers Corbyn and Nick\nHolmes finally proposed\nthat I.C.U. condemns Sennet for wholly misrepresenting the attitude of both\nstudents and police at the\nforthcoming demonstration\nand for printing an article of\na grossly inflammatory na-ture. An amendment that\na letter be sent to the Editor\nconveying our opinion was\ncarried and the final motion\nwas carried almost unani-mou sly. Mr. Boothman got up to\npropose an \" emergency\nmotion \" to the effect that\nwe send our sympathies to\nthe Associated Electrical\nand Foundry Workers Union\nin their struggle to win a living wage. The conservative Union voted that the\nmotion not even be put to\ntii e house.\nDramsoc provided ma-chin e gunning effects at\nsuitable moments, and an\nextremely disrespectful playing of the Queen to finish\nthe meeting.\nThe main event at the Tuesday 22nd R.C.S. Union\nmeeting was the announcing of the official result of the\nPresidential Ballot held the previous day. Gwyn Hughes\nof Maths 3 triumphed over Peter Dolwin with a landslide\nvictory by 339 votes to 173, with 96 abstentions\ntradition demands\nAs\nGwyn stripped to a pair of\nshorts and made three circuits of the lecture theatre\nbearing the R.C.S. mascot\nTheta above his head. He\nrecited the Kangela backwards and took a long\ndraught of an odious liquid,\ndutifully prepared by the\nSecretary. The meeting\nmoved outdoors and the\nQueen of Jez, Wendy Leigh\nwith several eager helpers,\nproceeded to daub every\navailable inch of Gwyn's skin with paint in the R.C.S. colours. The final initiation\nceremony was then carried\nout by ex-president Jeff\nWarren. who anointed\nGwyn with the remainder of\nhis \" drink.\"\nGwyn then led the mob in\na Kangela even though dripping with paint, milk, beer,\nand whatever else Chris\nYewlett had seen fit to mix\ninto the brew.\nAmong the more formal\nUnion business Martin\nBland proposed that, in\nfuture, presidential elections\nshould be held during the\nEaster term of the College\nyear, to enable candidates to\ncampaign without the pressures of approaching exam i nations, and thus R.C.S. would not be in the distressing position of being without a president for long\nperiods at a time. This was\nunopposed and carried. Photographs of \" Davy \" which\nhad been stolen as reported\nelsewhere in FELIX were\ncirculated in the audience\u2014\njust to give them a thrill.\nLastly, Mr. Jeff Warren,\nformer acting president, was\nC.& G.U. For Guilds Union meeting on Tuesday the 22nd, an\nalmost full M.E.220 was re-corded, if Guilds bother to\nrecord these things at all.\nDave Cox is already showing remarkable efficiency\nand ;speed in reading the\nminutes and no doubt will\nsoon have them down to\none flat.\nA letter was read to the\nUnion from the Senior\nWarden expressing his dismay in the remarkable improvement in the Fresher's dinners this year, or perhaps\nit was the increase in rowdy-knighted by Adolf with the\naid of a large, paint-smeared\nmodel of \"Spanner,\" and\nthe mob broke up. leaving\nGwyn chanting a lone\nKangela.\nS. KEN. UNIV.\nMap\nThe groovy map\u2014double\nsize foolscap\u2014-local map on\none side\u2014region map and\ninformation on the other\u2014\u2022\nis on the way\u2014many people are he loing \u2014 finishing\ntouches will be put on\nThursday night\u2014if you\nh \u00bb'- -was we may have\nmissed come along\u2014map\nwill be out early next week.\nMilitancy\nThe Rector, in his own\ninimitable way, attacked\nthe activities of militant\nstudents at other colleges\nand summarised the progress of the previous year,\npaying particular attention\nto the improvements in\nstaff-student relations at\nthis college and the increase\nin residential ac com moda tion. He also reported on\nthe proposed union with\nthe Architectural Association and the emergence of\nan Imperial College Medical School.\nThe Special Visitor, Sir\nDenning Pearson. Deputy\nChairman of Rolls-Royce,\ndelivered an address outlining recent and possible\nfuture changes in British\nindustry, particularly with\nregard to co-operation with\nthe universities. He emphasised the importance to\nthe survival of Britain as a nation of increasing the\nflow of talent into industry\nin order to enable us to\ncompete effectively in world\nmarkets.\nOur Union Secretary,\nnot-so-plain Jane Perason,\nperformed the task of Student Orator with a cool and\ncalmly confident air. It\nmust be noted that a certain member of the Executive appeared to be suffering from the effects of his\n21st birthday during the\nceremony.\nPleasure?\nWere it not for the pleasure afforded to parents, it\ncould be argued that the\nwhole farcical and highly\nexpensive procedure could\nbe safely forgotten. However, I'm sure that even\nthey would agree that the\nwhole charade could be\neasily speeded up without\nlosing any of its essential\nfeatures.\nism that was mentioned, I forget.\nMorphy Day\nMorphy Day was advertised by Frank Coldwell,\nand that happens to be today so don't forget to go\nand throw flour or something at Dermott, all you\nGuildsmen. The Brighton\nrun on Nov. 3rd was also\nmentioned, something about\na py jama party (early morn-ing) in Hyde Park, I think.\nThe special branch of R.C.S. Motor Club, training for Sunday's riots was visited\nby some officer of the Metropolitan Police already trained to our way of J^S\" JezwSnoi only used for joy-riding, but was commandeered by the sergeant to carry his\nsquad to strategic positions in l.C. Bos Bird\nThe election of Bo-Belle,\na bin' to go in Boanerges,\nwas carried out with Corr\nhaving proposed to the\nglamorous girls in Guilds.\nA very mysterious girl,\nPaulie, vaguely disguised as\nGuilds Ents. Officer, was\nelected but the official Belle\nwas announced later as Jane\nAshton of Mech. Eng. I. Paulie's deposing is believed\nto be due to her inability to\nsing in a low enough voice\nwhile stripteasing to the\ngoggle-eyed guilds men. Paul Shelton (heavily disguised as Paulie) then announced the \" Play the\ngame \" GUILDSmines Carnival, 40s. double, with possibilities of him having P.P. Arnold on Nov. 15.\nTwo films, which could\nhave been described as r ol licking, of Bo and various\ncustard-pie fights and er . . .\nBo, were shown amidst improvised sound effects and\ncries of, \" Where's Spanner?\" ( + \u00a3%$&?)\nThe lights on again revealed spanner shrunk to a size which Dermott could\nactually lift, but it soon\nlengthened on suitable\nswitching. Finally he held\nit up and cried out \"Booma-laka!\"\n\n"

    "content": "WE LE SOd U.F.O's The i Tells oc U.F.O. group held its first meeting of the season in\nthe Electrical Engineering Common Room last Thursday night. The group\nunder the leadership of the President, Derek Hale, exists to take an\nactive part in the investigations of unidentified flying objects or\nU.F.O's. Just over a do a en people attended the meeting where there was a discussion of general U.F.O. topics supplemented by cups of coffee.\nNew members were entertained by numerous interesting and amusing\nstories although none offered any conclusive proof of the existence\nof a U.F.O. In most cases-of sightings the evidence can be disproved\nsufficiently and the minority of possible cases, although unexplained,\nare still open to a great amount of doubt. Nevertheless a group\ncommittee has been formed to make further plans for the future, New members would be welcome. Generally the group arranges trips to\nlectures and similar societies and occasionally to a cottage in Wales\nto make observations. It is also hoped that some work will be done\nanalysing data using the college computer system.\nI' \u2022 DEBATES\nDebates at I.C. have :\"or too many years been centred on a small\ngroup of people discussing rather than debating mainly political\nmotions. This year's President Chris Parker, back in harness after\na year in the wilderness, hopes to change this and already has\nachieved some success. He has introduced two new functions this term^\none of which was the Fresher's debating Competition. He is very\nsecretive about the other, but it is known that it will be a trial\nidea involving the top of the Union, talc ing place on Nov. 19 th.\nTomorrow Thurs. 31st.,, there will be a debate on the motion:\nThis House considers the Motorist to be a Persecuted Class of the\nCommunity.\" Raymond Baxter from the B.B.C. will be proposing it and\nProf, Colin Buchanan will oppose.\nTickets for Guilds - Mines Carnival go on sale on Thursday in the\nUnion and Southside. Price \u00a32 double. P.P. Arnold topping the bill.\nTheme: Play the game.\nSPANNER\nThe President of C&G, Dermott Corr, is very pleased at the way both Mines and R.C.S. have been hook winked into believing Spanner has\nbeen lost. As a result Spanner was at Civil Eng Fresher1\ns Dinner on\nMonday night and no-one attempted to molest it. He hopes that all\nGuildsmen, who also believe that Spanner has been lost, will forgive\nhim, bearing in mind that the means justify the end.\nA CORRECTION Map of University of cou th Kensington will come out with next\nFELIX, not next week. People with ideas for the map should bring\nthem to 621 Tizard before Friday November 8th, DElvlONSTMTION NUMBERS Over 100 people from I.C. went to the Demonstration.

Union meeting\npassed a motion condemning Sennet for the \"Wholly mis representative attitude\" and\"grossly inflammatory nature\" of its articles referring\nto last Sunday's demonstration. Following this motion and the sending\nof a letter to Sennet, which was not published, a group of people\nsubmitted a draft copy of a protest to members of I.C. Exec, who individually approved it. The protest was duplicated on the Rector's duplicating machine and over 5?000 copies distributed to several\nLondon Colleges including I..C. However, after the distribution, someone had second thoughts\nabout the protest and the wisdom of signing it \"I.C. Executive\nCommittee,\" Accordingly, x; the Exec, meeting on Monday, the matter\nwas discussed and it was agreed that nothing more shall be done.\n\n"

    "content": "black\ndwarf\nKen Garrett and Pat Rotherham visit the editorial offices of\nthe Black Dwarf.\nBefore Sunday's demonstration, Felix visited The\nBlack Dwarf, the radical newspaper edited by ' Tariq Ali.\nAli himself was away speaking in Nottingham, and we\nspoke to two Dwarf workers.\nHome Issues\nPerhaps the most important point is that the Dwarf\nwould like to see the demonstration more concerned\nwith home issues\u2014such as\nhousing, unemployment,\nand the wage freeze. This\nmust happen if the public is\nnot to be alienated by unnecessary violence in demos\nagainst an abstract issue, as\nVietnam is to people living\nin England. L^ nner s carried\non the march will emphasise\nthis point. For Vietnam is\nseen as a more obvious example of the oppression\nwhich exists in all capitalist\n(the West), or bureaucratic\n(the USSR), societies. \" The\nVietnamese are the same as\nus but have to use different\nweapons. We must use\nstrikes and demos.\" They\nclaim, with some justice,\nthat this is a repressive society for those who dissent\nfrom it, citing times when\nthey have been \" lean t on \"\nby the police.\nPolice =\nViolence\nOf course, the police, being the most obvious manifestation of repression in any\nstate, come in for a great\ndeal of criticism. Felix\nsuggested that their presence\nat demos is mainly for the\nprotection of property. The\nDwarf disagrees with this.\nOne of them told us \"I know for a fact that there\nare two thousand police\nvolunteers in South East\nEngland, ready for Sunday.\"\nIn fact, they are certain that\nthere would be no vi of c nee if\nthere were so police present;\nthey also agreed that this\ncould not be guaranteed, \"If\nthe police slop us going\nwhere wc want to go, it is\nprovocation and there will\nbe violence.\" If the police\nwere not there, would Downing Street, for instance, be\nsafe? \" If anyone goes into\nDowning Street, they want\ntheir head examined--it's a cul-de-sac, and you can get\ncut off and have hell thumped out of you.\"\nBiased\nPress\nThe people we spoke to\nboth said they were personally opposed to the use of\nviolence; nonetheless they\nexpected it on Sunday. They\nplace a large amount of\nblame on the popular press,\nin particular the Evening\nNews. Their advice was\nnot to provoke or become\ninvolved in unnecessary vio-len ce. \"Necessary violence\"\napparently means rescuing\npeople from arrest.\nProvocation\nOne can make out quite a good case for provoking the\npolice to violence in order\nto demonstrate clearly the\nrepressive nature of capitalist society, which is otherwise quite subtle in its me-i hods. The Dwarf agreed\nthat this could be a legitimate aim for a demo, but\ndenied that it was any part\nof the plan for Sunday.\nBrainWashing\nSome kind of revolution\nis necessary in this country.\nMany people at IC must fec i the futility of becoming but\na cog in the vast business\nmachine\u2014yet capitalist society would trammel their\nlife down the smooth channels it has prepared for it.\nThe chief agents in this are\nthe mass media, the \" brain\npolice,\" who would stifle\nany attempt at true freedom.\nAnd Finally:\nVietnam\nThe Vietnam issue has\nbecome the international\nmobil is er of left-wing mili-tan cy. At the Dwarf they\nbelieve that change is not\npossible through evolution\nof present systems, and that\nconditions are becoming\nright for social revolution,\nas nearly happened in\nFrance last May. Whether\nor not their way is the right\none we cannot say. Perhaps things will seem clearer\nby the time you read this.\nFELIX DERIDED BY NATIONALS An article misinterpreting the account in the last\nissue of FELICITY of IC's intention to set up an emergency office during Sunday's demonstration appeared in\nthe Evening News last week.\nThe article appeared as follows :\n\" An emergency office for\nmilitant left-wingers who\nmay be arrested in the demonstrations is being set up\nat Imperial College, South\nKensington. Information on\nwhere to phone is given in\na broadsheet included in this\nweek's issue of FELIX, the\nCollege student magazine.\nA broadsheet on legal'rights\nwill also be available.\"\nThe Daily Mirror and Daily\nExpress carried similar\narticles.\nCorrection\nRefused\nAn impromptu meeting of\nI.C. executive was called at\nlunchtime last Wednesday\nand following this Rex\nLowin sent a letter to the\nEvening News repeating the\nreasons for setting up the\noffice and stressing that it\nwas set up to provide advice\nfor students from I.C., \"not\nto protect them from the\ncourse of the Law.\" When\nRex and Jane Pearson went\nto see the Managing Editor\nof the \" News,\" he refused\nto correct the erroneous impression given in their article and would not publish\nthe letter.\nFELIX wishes to emphasise that the article in question made clear that the\noffice was open only to give\nadvice to Imperial College\nstudents and not to students\nin general as the \" News \"\narticle implies. FELIX also\ncondemns the Evening News\nfor twisting the facts printed\nin FELICITY and forgiving\nthe impression that LC. is a hotbed ef militant Maoism.\nWhat could be further from\nthe truth!\nEXEC\nCLOCKS\nOUT\nAt a recent meeting of the\nExecutive a request that the\nUnion clocks be stopped for\na short period as part of the\npublicity campaign for\nPHOENIX was refused.\nPart of the advertising\ntheme, \"Time stops for\nPhoenix \" was deemed as,\n\" Silly an v way.\" Well now! \"People in glass\nhouses . . .\nLeft Wins At Debate The motion : This house\nbelieves that negotiations\nachieve more than militant\nstudent demonstrations, was\noverwhelmingly defeated at\nthe last I.C. debate. Interest\nin the motion c eat red around the two main speak-ers, Peter Watherson (Presi-dent of L.S.E. during the\nsit-in) and David Triesman\n(expelled from Essex last\nsession).\nMr. Watherson, proposing the motion, felt that the\npresent awareness of the\ninadequacies of high eiv edu cation was not confined V to a minority of activities and all\nreforms had so far been\nachieved by hard bargaining in negotiations. He made\nspecial mention of the recent N.U.S. \u2014Vice-Chancellor report.\nThe proposer thought the\nvalue of the L.S.E. sit-in\nhad been nil insofar as no\nreal reforms were gained by-it, and subsequent student\nrepresentation on committees in the school were solely\nthe results of negotiations.\nHe then went on to attack\nthe militant students for not\nattaining anything, and felt\nthat many demonstrations\ntook place only to give new\nexperiences to the students.\nIn a long, wide ranging\nand often witty speech opposing the motion, David\nTriesman explained what\nstudent reaction should be\nto major political topics. He\nfound sympathy on the\nfloor when drawing a parallel between the bureaucratic\nN.U.S. and their counterparts on University staff.\nHis main argument relative to the motion was that\nstudents were in a position\nto set a new code of ethics.\nSince problems such as\nVietnam, race and germ\nwarfare were of an emotional nature, negotiations\nfailed to express the real\nfeelings involved. He therefore urged that militant demonstration was the only\nmethod of getting the\nbureaucrats to act.\nThe second er for the motion had little to say. but the\nsecond er for the opposition\nquoi ed examples of militant\ndemonstrations s uc ceding abroad where negotiations\nhad failed. He mentioned\nin particular the Indian at-tainan ce of independence\nand the French students' re-volt.\nAfter three short speeches\nfrom the floor, the motion\nwas put to the vote. The\nresult was 4 votes for and\n35 against with 19 abstentions. FELIX\nfiD\n30 Oetobei V,. UDllJU\nXT2 As I sit here in the early morning looking over the\nsleeping I.C. from my tower it is very difficult to think\nof anything interesting or nasty to pronounce on. In fact,\nit is very difficult to think of anything other than this\ndamned cold draught blowing up my left leg.\nKing Guy is dead ! Long live Keith Guy! This\nsturdy old perennial\u2014this is his fourth year on Council\n(and the Library Committee)-has no ppe d un again as\nChairman of Ents. Isn't it about time someone gave him a job and we got rid of him. If lie stays here much longer\nthe only thing he'll get is a pension\nIs it true he got Pete Nichols elected as Chairman for\nthis year knowing that he would not be here, to take up\nthe post ? It certainly looks like it! Then comes Sir\nGuy in his suit of shining armour and white horse to rescue\nthe situation by offering to look after things until the next\nChairman was elected\u2014him ! Why was the vacancy not\nwidely published and the fact that anyone could stand!\nFor a long time not even his own committee knew this!\nHowever, what's done is done and it will be with great\ninterest that we will watch to sec just how good Guy will\nbe. Last year Ents certainly were on top. The list of\ngroups who played here and went to have a hit record bears\nwitness to this. Already the name of Joe Cocker can b: added to that list. Here lies the snag. It was rumoured\nthat his committee\u2014most of whom have left were responsible for this and would have done even better were it not\nfor Guy.\nBut Keith remains confident! He is talking of a profit of \u00a32.000 this year. He certainly wouldn't do that\nif he continues as he has done over the last few weeks.\nPeople aren't so thick (are you ?) that they will continue to\npay exorbitant prices to listen to crap groups (costing \u00a315\na time) and stagger in the ever-increasing gloom over copulating couples trying to find a decent looking bird\u2014that\nyou should be so lucky !\nLast year l.C. hops, sorry, informal dances, were fast\nbecoming famous not only throughout the other London\nColleges!\" but over in the world of pop music.

I do not know\nit bei hv there were riots, wholesale arrests or outbreaks of\nt tfl dah although 1 suspect this was the case. 1 am\nuK U\" concerned .at the moment with similar happenings in\nthe Union after the Chem Eng Freshers' Dinner on the\n2lit. As reported elsewhere in FELIX, some irresponsible\nmember* of Chem Eng spent their time smashing glasses\nand bot tt as and hurling fireworks in the Union Bar, while a few romped off the evening by throwing glasses in the\nPrince Consort Road. This sort of behaviour should not be\ntolerated from anyone, let alone from the supposed cream\nof the country's youth. Not only are smashed beer mugs\nexpensive to replace, but a carpet of broken glass is\ndangerous especially if someone in his drunken css should\nslip and fall on it. Even more dangerous is the lighting of\nfireworks in a crowded bar and, on the night in question,\nfireworks were not merely lit but deliberately thrown at\npeople. I need not comment on the incident in Prince\nConsort Road; the sheer hooliganism of the act speaks\nfor itself. It is expected by now that there be singing and\nchants and heavy drinking in the bar after Freshers' Dinners, but not irresponsible vandalism of the sort that occurred the other Monday. That night the limit was reached\u2014\nlet it not be reach-d again.\nFrom irresponsibility to un in t crest. Mr. Mooney, the\nguy in charge of refectories at the College, seems to be\ncompletely apathetic toward the idea of the Southside\ncoffee bar. Despite valiant efforts to liven the place up last\nweek with canned music, it has been bedevilled by poor\norganisation on the part of the catering staff. Firstly the\nrefreshment offered is extremely limited. No-one seems to\nhave heard of milk-shakes or anything apart inm coffee\nand Pepsi. The range of foodstuffs is limited to lukewarm\npies and rock-hard sausage rolls. Secondly, on several\n..ig ht: recently even the small range of food and drink has\nbeen reduced to coffee and tea and the coffee machine\nhad broken down and was not repaired for three days.\nOn the subject of the coffee bar, I believe there is no\nprovision for similar facilities in the new college block.\nWhy not kill two birds with one stone and turn the\ninefficient and understood Southside shop into a decent\ncoffee inn with music and an intimate atmosphere.\nAnd from food to fire. Isn't it about time we had a few fire drills around College? Apart from brightening up\nour hardworking academic lives they are quite useful from\nthe safety point of view. A case that springs to mind is\nSouth side\u2014a real death-trap if a major fire occurred!\nI notice that Unstead Hall has already educated its inhabitants in escape procedure and I think the Southside\nHalls should follow their younger brother's example. After\nthe minor fire last year when one room in Southside was\nburnt out while people hung out of the windows to cheer\nthe fire engines as they arrived to deal with the case, someone should be thinking of the effect of fire sweeping up\na whole staircase.

The Friday\nnight concerts were discussed and Mr. Nicholls\nwas to book artistes for\nthese. He was also to book\nartistes for this year's informal dances.

Cowin, Keith Guy,\nP. Ashcroft, N.C. Clark,\nGordon Sage,\nK. Parkinson, S. England.\nSir,\nI am writing in the wake\nof a mascot mania, which\nhas brought up the whole\nquestion of inter-collegiate\nrivalry. Why should RCS\nhave \"removed\" the Miners'\nprecious Davy lamp? Why\nshould the Miners seek revenge by attempting to rid\nRCS of their invaluable\nTheta? Mascots are surely\nintended as a symbol of the\npride you should take in\nyour constituent college.\nDoes it really prove anything\nif someone breaks down a door and walks off with a symbol? If you think it does\nwhy not join the Wooden\nHorse Club and squeeze\nblood out of other colleges;\nafter all they've given us\nquite a run around with our\nimpregnable \" Mike.\"\nDon't get me wrong\nthough. Rivalry and competition between Guilds, Mines\nand RCS is a very good\nthing, but can't we restrict\nit to Morphy Day and\nsports events.\nFRANK COLDWELL\n(Vice-pre s.C&G) Student House Facts\nSir,\nWe feel that certain misleading information about\nMining House was published\nin Mr. Ebdon's article\n\" They Tell Me \" in the last\nissue of FELIX. The facts\nare as follows:\nThere are nine toilets and\nseven baths for 60 res i dents. 17 residents have\nhand-basins in their own\nrooms, the rest share seven\nbasins. Whilst there is a shortage of hand basins, especially at the bottom of\nthe house, it is hoped to install extra units in future.\nThe toilet and bath facilities\nin the house are adequate\nand residents have experienced little or no inconvenience on this score.\nIt is unrealistic to assume\nthat a new venture such as\nthe opening of Student\nHouses should be unaccompanied by teething troubles\nand most of these are of a minor nature which most\nresidents are accepting\ncheerfully. The concensus\nof informed opinion within\nthe House is that accommodation compares reasonably\nwell with the Halls. The\ndecorating of the staircases\nwill be finished this week,\nwashing and drying equipment will soon be installed\nand plans for improving the\ncooking facilities are under\nconsideration.\nThere are about five vacancies in Mining House\nwhich are being kept for the\nresidents of 40-44 Evelyn\nGardens who are finding\ndifficulty with their present\naccommodation. Anyone\nin this position should get\nin touch with the warden at\n55 Evelyn Gardens.\nAs Mr. Ebdon says,\nsomething must be done to\nattract students to Student\nHouses. What better than\nan informed article in FELIX giving an accurate\noverall picture, not just the\ndifficulties?\nIncidentally, Miss Jane\nPearson is Secretary of IC\nUnion.\nDAVID M. HARRIS\nR.F. PHILLIPS\nJ. SAMMES\nSquash Courts and Staff\nSir,\nI would like to express\nmy deep regret at the recent\ndecision to exclude all staff\nfrom the squash courts.\nDuring the last academic\nyear certain issues e.g. park-ing, refectories and use of\nthe swimming pool were\nthrashed out on the basis of\ncommunal use by all members of the College. My\nfeelings have always been\nthat Imperial College is not\njust academic staff or undergraduates but a small community in which we all have\na part to play. In addition,\nthe College has built up\nexcellent staff-student relations and consequently\nthis sudden exclusion of\nstaff from the squash courts\nwhich has happened since\nthe long vacation could have\nunfortunate repercussions,\ne.g. how many students use\nthe Holland Club at lunch-times?\nQuite a few members of\nstaff have expressed their\nregret at this decision and I am sure that most members\nof the College would appreciate a clarification of the\nmotives behind it.\nR.F. PHILLIPS,\nChem. PG Press\nMisconceptions\nSir,\nAt the last Union meeting\nwe passed a motion condemning Sennet for mis-representation. Somebody\nstated that as Sennet was\nbasically conveying fact rather than opinion our motion was not to be supported.\nPeople who read the articles\nin Sennet would agree that\nth.:> were largely factual,\nbut the point was surely the\nheading\u2014it implied that\nthere was almost an urban\nguerilla war being prepared\n\u2014this is extremely mislead-ing, and therefore must be\ncondemned.\nSuch headings tend to encourage violence because :\n(a) people go there expecting it\n(b) people who do not want\nit stay away.\nThe neo-nationalist-mono-poi y press abo misrepresent,\nin a similar manner, and because they often report\nONLY the violence they\ncreate more violence (de-mon st rations want pub li city). Students are beginning to realise more fully the\ngeneral press misrepresentations\u2014especially after the\nEvening News event.\nIf the general deceit of\nthe press continues, student\nmilitancy will become more\ndirected against the press, as\nit is in Germany, and then\nmaybe Sennet's headlines\nwill be accurate.\nPIERS CORBY N( Chairman ICU Peace\nAction Groupl\nFascists\nSir,\nA new low in literacy has\nbeen reached in a broadsheet placed on the Southside noticeboards by the IC\nConservative Soc. In it we\nhear of a strange political\ngroup called \"Fascists\" and\nwe are also told that the\nSociety will persuade lis of\ntheir point of view by \" sub-tile \" means.

The size and order made it.\naccording to a middle-aged observer, \"The greatest\ndemonstration that has occurred in Britain since the\n1930's.\" After the recent gross\nmisrepresentation in the\npress, many \" moderates \"\nstayed away expecting vio-en ce. The apprehension\nof the people who went was\ndispelled not long after the\nstart at Charing Cross\nwhen the peaceful intentions of most of the demonstrators became apparent.\nThey linked arms on the\nEmbankment and moved\nforward gazing at the multitudes of banners and placards n ro testing about Vietnam, British and American\ncapitalism and society in\ngeneral\u2014in fact about the\n\" system \" and as Dect s of\nthe \" system \"' which condone such a war as that in\nVietnam. Many different\npolitical factions were there\n\u2014-among the Maoists, the\nYoiflfg Communists and the\nVietnam Solidarity Campaign were the IC Peace\nAction Group and Young\nLiberals \u2014 chanting \" Victory to the NLF\" and \" We are all foreign scum.\"\nAll IC demonstrators had\nthree leaflets, one from the\nN CCL. one from IC and\none from the organising\ncommittee which explained\n$he exact route and the tactics to be used by the demonstrators \u2014 \" Street\nor whatever happened\nto baby davy ?\nAfter weeks of meticulous planning by RCS Mascot\nCommittee, a hand-picked team carried out a lamp raid\nlast Thursday week and made off with RSMU's hitherto\nvirgin mascot.

It did not\nlast, for they opened a can,\nmarked \" Open only in\ndarkroom,\" in the middle\nof the dinner, thus destroying an undeveloped strip of\nfilm.

    "content": "FELIX30 October 1968\nAs many of you know,\nI 've never been opposed to\nequal rights for women;\nindeed as a Socialist I have\nalways been an ardent advocate for equal pay, but men\nhave always had a sneaking\nsuspicion that the ladies\nwere after more than just\nthat.\nMatriarchs\nAmerican men have\nlong insisted that they live\nin a matriarchal society and\none can well believe them,\nbut until recently any suggestion that the women were\ntaking over in ICU would\nhave seemed ridiculous to a Union eagerly seeking new\nways to attract girls to IC.\nProbably the only ex c ep THEY TELL ME....\nt ions to male-dominated\nICU were ICWA and Mrs.\nRob' (now no longer with\nus).\nSmile-Power\nHowever, male comp lancy at this College has\nbeen shattered as the women\nhave moved in on one top\nUnion job after another, by\nusing the two deadly weapons of the female of the\nspecies \u2014 feminine charm\nand that \"woman behind the\nman\" stunt. Outstanding\nexponents of the smile-power brand of politics are\nStudent Houses were first suggested in the Union about\ntwo years ago, and now I think it may be a good time to\nexplain both the original concepts and the actual details of\nwhat we are getting.\nThe basic idea was that, if we could somehow raise the\nmoney to buy some large local houses, then this would be\nbeneficial to students in two ways. Firstly, they could be\nlet to students at a cheaper rate than equivalent bed-sitters,\nsince we would not expect to make a profit. Secondly, it\nwould provide more accommodation in the local area, to\nhelp avoid the need for students to go up to 10 miles out to\nfind somewhere to live. The main reason for opting for\nhouses, rather than more Halls, is that they could be\nbought and converted for just over \u00a31,000 per place, about\nhalf the cost per place of a Hall of residence.\nThe biggest difficulty in this scheme, fairly under-stand ably, was to find the money in the first place. We had\nproduced several ideas, and then we took the whole scheme\nto the College Governors, for their help and advice. It\nturned out that they too had been considering similar\nschemes, and they agreed to try to raise the money for us.\nThe purchase of a house was agreed, and this should have\nopened at the beginning of last session. However, the owner\nof that house began to change his mind about selling, and\nn ftp. r several months the deal finally fell through.\nThe search for a new house started, and about six\nmonths ago an organisation called \"Smiths Charities\"\noffered to lease to os three houses in Evelyn Gardens at the\nnominal rent of \u00a32250 per annum. Since then we have\nnegotiated the leasing of another 14 houses, also from\nSmith's Charities, which are enough for a total of 350\npeople. The leases are for 20 years with a possible extension to 27 years and IF we make a relatively small profit\neach year, then we could save at least part of the money\nto buy some replacement houses. When once the houses\nare running, it should be fairly easy to control any profit\nmade, just by altering the rents, although we will have to\ndecide on a compromise between keeping rents low and\nbuilding up capital for later on.\nDonations Still Needed\nIn order to finance the conversion of the houses into\nbed sitters, the Governors had to look for donations. The\nOverseas Mining Association paid for the conversion of\nthe first three houses and at their wish this unit is to be\ncalled \"Mining House.\" As you know, this house is\nalready open. The second group of five houses have been\npaid for by the Bernard Sunley Foundation, and the contractors should be finishing sections of that between 15\nNovember and 6 December. It should then be ready for\noccupation about a fortnight later. As yet no money\nhas been found to convert the last nine houses, which\nwill be split into groups of three, but it is still hoped that\nthey can be finished by the summer.\nThe exact future of the houses, in terms of both rents\nand the facilities they provide, has still to be decided, and\nthere is no doubt that many things can be improved.\nHowever, they will still provide housing for a large number\nof IC students which is both closer and cheaper than that\nwhich they had before.\nREX LOWIN - PRESIDENT ICU\nJane Pearson, the Secretary\nof ICU, and Lilas Campion,\nChairman of the Political\nSocieties Council and ICU Council floor rep., both\nTories of the non-blue-stocking type.

    "content": "_FELIX30 October 1968\nSPORTS NEW Sed tito al With everyone suffering from post-Olympic mental\nindigestion, readers will be forgiven if they give the sports\npage a miss this week. However, although they weren't among the medals, we must congratulate Messrs. Bayles,\nMalpass, Cooper (Rowing), and Graham Paul (Fencing)\nfor their efforts in Mexico.\nOn the Rugby front, we must extend our sympathies\nto Mines Tankards (3rd XV) who in the mis-match of the\nyear were beaten 100-0 by U.L.1 st XV at Hotspur Park\nlast week, despite some remarkable new tactical plays by\nthe losers. On Sunday, the 1st XV play the Belgium\nNational XV at Harlington, K.O.11 a.m. Coaches\n9.30 a.m.. Union Arch.\nOn a more victorious note it was good to see the 1st XV win so convincingly against such arch rivals as U.C.I gather than the trend, hasn't been entirely maintained,\nbut I am sure we can hope for some more good results\nthis season.\nSOLID START\nBY ROWERS\nThe Boat Club has made\na very promising start to\nthe year's training and a significant increase in membership has been achieved\nwith the aid of a lively recruiting campaign extending\nwell beyond the first week\nof term. New members have\nbeen joining steadily each\nweek and an outing on the\nriver in some form of boat\nis guaranteed even if it is\none's first time \"down.\"\nMorphy Day this year,\napart from the usual sport\non the towpath, should pro.\nvi de an interesting after-noon's entertainment as the\nconstituent college crews appear to be of a fairly even\nstandard though the inevitable secrecy prevents an accurate assessment. Races\ntake pj ace at 3.00 and 3.30\nfor the Lowry and Morphy\nCups respectively but most\n\" spectators\" arrive well\nbefore these times.\nOn Saturday 19th October\nfive crews represented the\nCollege in the Four's Head\nof the River race which was\nthe first of a full programme\nof regattas and Head races\nduring the year. The race\nwas rowed in the normal\nprocessional fashion, each\ncrew starting 10 seconds behind the previous one.\nOut of 124 entries the 1st IV finished 18th;2 nd IV\u2014\n72nd;3 rd IV\u201460th;4 th IV\n73rd; and 5th IV 104th. G.W. HARRISON\nFENCING We have had many enquiries from beginners\nabout the Club, but unfortunately the number of experienced fencers is less than\nwe had envisaged. The Club\nhas no formal trials for the\nfirst team selection, but relies on the Captain's ability\nto select the team by assessing a fencer's performance\nduring sessions. Professor\nAkos Moldevanye provides\nfirst class coaching for two\nhourly periods a week. Details of the times of club\nmeetings can be found on\nthe club notice board, which\nis situated near the Union\ncloakroom.\nThe fixture list for the\nyear includes the entry of\nteams consisting each of a foi list, an e pee is t, and a sab-rent, for the Goddin Cup\n(a London University intercollegiate trophy) which we\nhave held for the last three\nyears. Two teams, one a ladies' team, are being entered for the London\nLeague, which is a competition open to all Londonbased fencing clubs. Since\nthis latter competition is run\non similar lines to the F.A. League, it entails a large\nnumber of matches. Any\ngaps in the fixture list are\nreadily filled with matches\nwith non-London clubs.\nEvery endeavour is made to\npic vi de competitive fencing\nfor fencers of all levels of\nexperience.\nGREAT\nI.C. WIN\nI.C. won the first league\nmatch of the season in as\nconvincing a manner as the\nscore line suggests. The I.C. team, including no less than\nseven fresher s to the college,\nplayed fast open football\nand thoroughly deserved\nthis victory.\nPlaying with the wind\nand the sun, the I.C. attack put pressure on the\nU.C. defence in the opening\nstages of the game and after\nsome near misses Tom McCardle put I.C. ahead, with a fine angled shot. I.C. continued to dominate the game\nand used the one-two move\nto great effect. It was this\nmove which put Bob Horlock th rd ugh the defence to\nscore the second goal.\nAlthough U.C. tried to\nbreak out of defence they\nwere easily contained by the\nLC. back line ?u id the midfield players took control.\nShortly before half-time I.C. scored again when Dave\nKing hit a superb swerving\nshot which the goalkeeper\ncould only help into the pet.\nAfter half-time I.C. expected a determined effort\nby U.C., who now had the\nadvantage of wind and sun\nbut it was in fact I.C. who\ncontinued to exert pressure\nand soon Tony Richards put\nI.C. further ahead. After\nthis I.C. were in complete\ncommand and Bob Horlock\nand Roger Dixon, who wandered intelligently from his\nnormal role in the back line,\nadded further goals. U.C. scored a rather fortunate\ngoal in the closing stages\nbut by this time I.C. were\nconvincing winners.\nThis was a splendid win\nby the I.C. XI and, although\nthe defence has yet to be\nseen under pressure, there\nare great hopes for the coming season,\nR.C.S.6' s In the R.C.S.

XV MEET\nTHE BIG BOYS\nThe 1st XV can count\nthemselves un luck v to have\nbeen beaten by this margin\nby a competent Rosslyn\nPark XV. Like I.C., Rosslyn Park has been having\nno little trouble with their\n1st XV and had dropped 7\nof that team, most of whom\nappeared against I.C. on\nSaturday.\nPine opened the scoring\nwith a penalty from the\nPark's10yd s line but there\nwas a quick reo ly with\nanother penalty. The Park\nsteadily built up the pressure on I.C. and before\nhalf-time had scored ' a dropped goal and two tries\n\u2014one from a very good\nthree-quarter movement,\none rather dubious. However I.C. can really only\nblame their own slack tackling for being 14-3 down at\nthis stage.\nThe second half was\nmuch better for the fitter\nI.C. team, and a beautiful\nbeautiful I.C. try was\nrounded off by Heaton after\nsome thrilling passing. 14-6\nwas to be the final score.;\nI.C. all but scored twice\nmore. Very near the end,\nthe Park's kicker justly\nmissed a penalty under\nI.C.'s posts.\nWeady Leigh, this year's Queen of Jet.\nWINTER CRICKET During this term and\nnext I.C. cricket club\nwill be making weekly visits\nto Alf Gover's indoor school\nand any person who would\nlike to play cricket during\nthe Summer Term is encouraged to come along.\nThe nets are at the moment\nbooked from 12\u20141 p.m. on Stjnday but if this proves\nto be an impossible time\nfor some, then other more\nsuitable times can be ar-ranged.\nThroughout the summer\nterm the cricket club runs\nthree regular Wednesday\nand Saturday teams and\none side on Sundays. We\npride ourselves on a strong\nand varied fixture list with\nmatches against both U.L. Colleges and club sides in\nand around London.\nIn 1966 and 1967 seasons\nwe finished runners-up in\nthe U.L. knock-out cup and\nin this coming season We\nwill be making a very determined \u00abeffort to at last win\nthe competition.\nOne of the highlights on\nthe season comes at the end\nof the summer term when\nthe cricket club goes on its\nannual tour of Devon. It is\nalways an enjoyable time\nand is an institution which\ncertainly no cricketer should\nmiss.\nHOCKEY\nNEWS\nThere was a healthy influx of new fife into the club\nat the beginning of the year/\nand at the trials the overall\nstandard was higher than in\nother years.\nBad weather delayed the\nstart of the season, so it was\nonly on Wednesday 16th that the 1st XI played their\nopening game against Guy's Hospital. The game began\nat a cracking pace with both\nsets of forwards hitting the\nball hard and fast. Guys\nopened the scoring in the\nfirst half with a shot from\nclose range from a pass off\nthe goal line. I.C. replied\nsoon afterwards through\nMike Pratt after a good run.\nThis was to remain the score\nfor the rest of the game.\nThe pace slackened considerably in the second half\ndue to lack of fitness on both\nsides.\nMIXED FORTUNES On Saturday 19th the college fielded 4 XI's against\nWest Essex. The 1st XI lost\n2\u20141 after leading at half\ntime through another good\ngoal from Pratt. The high-fight of the afternoon was\nthe !6\u20140 win by the 4th team who were playing with\nonly 10 men. The seconds\ndid well to draw 1\u20141, and\nthe 3rds lost 1\u20140.\nThe main disappointment\nthis, season has not been the\nplay but the attitude of\nsome players. It was hoped\nto have bad 5 teams this\nseason, and in l act fixtures\nfor the 5th had been ar-ranged, but people being\nunavailable has made it impossible to run this team so\nfar.\nSTEVE HILL\nDEVALUATION\nESCALATION\nRACIAL SEGREGATION\nDo you need\nInformation or\nSimply Edification?\nExercise your own\ndiscrimination by\nvisiting the\nHALDANE\nLIBRARY\nOpen 10-7\n(10-5.30 Wednesdays)\nLAMLEY'SAM LEY for your\u2014\nBOOKS\nART MATERIALS\nPAPER BACKS\nSTATIONERY\n\u2022\n1 EXHIBITION ROAD, S.W.7 SAILING FRESHER S EXCEL I.C.

    "content": "GERM WARFARE FELIX \u2022rim 1968\nM REPORT ON After all the fur ore and controversy in the national\npress and in Parliament a few months ago, the Microbiological Research Establishment at Porton Down, in a sleepy corner of Wiltshire, seems a relatively innocuous\nplace. On their first open day last Wednesday, M.R.E. appeared about as much of a threat to potential enemies\nas a baby banging a potty in the United Nations.\nThis appearance, Lowever, is probably a direct result of the superb public relations show they put on.\nThe staff fell over themselves in their enthusiasm to\ntell visitors about the unclassified work on show in\n51 exhibits and demonstrations all over the Establishment, and all the time emphasised the safety precautions taken there. Perhaps\nthis was principally to allay\nthe fears of the ladies of the\nlocal W.I. that errant germs\nmight be contaminating\ntheir home - made apricot\npreserve.\nA minor percentage of\nthe M. R.E.'s work is classified; this is on defence\nagainst Biological Warfare\n(B. W.) \u2014it being important\nnot to let too many people\nknow Britain's means of detecting B. W. and the behaviour of microbes in British\nweather conditions. M.R.E. staff are, however, quick to\npoint out that Porton does\nnot deal with Biological\nAttack. In the words of the\nMinister of Defence : \" . . .\nthe Microbiological Research Establishment is concerned with the protection\nof human life and not the\ntaking of it.\" On the subject of B. W. it is \" interesting \" to note that one ship\nin the Irish Sea could release a biological cloud\nwhich would knock out the\nentire U.K. Walking round the exhibits,\nthe emphasis seems to be on\npure and applied research\ninto medical problems.\nM.R.E. is looking into Asparaginase \u2014 a cancer suppressing agent that might\nhelp in the fight against\nLeukaemia \u2014 and at Monkey B disease, a monkey infection which recently\ncaused several deaths\namong research workers in\nGermany. Other diseases\nsuch as foot-and-mouth and\nJapanese encephalitis are\nalso under investigation.\nHowever the scientists,\napart from being delighted\nto show off their work, also\ntreat the open days as a great joke. Drawings of\nevil-looking microbes appear everywhere and in the\nornate reception tent there\nhangs a huge reproduction\nof a cartoon from \"The\nSun,\" poking fun at Porton. Pink and white sugar\nmice represent the results of\nexperiments on animals\n(pink\u2014dead ; white\u2014alive).\nAmateur works of art\nabound. In the chandelier-hung reception tent there\nare copies of pain tines such\nas the Rokeby Venus, while\na Porton Down art show is\non view elsewhere.\nTo anyone visiting\nM.R.E. expecting sensational revelations of mutations and microbe death XRays, the whole affair must\nhave been an intense disappointment. The place owes\nmore to Doctor Spock than\nFrankenstein. Perhaps in\nthe words of the guy from\nBritish Movietone News :\n\"The pretty girls from Salisbury are by far the most exciting things here.\"\nPAUL HEATH\nCHRIS SLEE\nBOOK Steven Rose.\nChemical & Biological Warfare\nHarrap 30/-CB W shows every sign of\nbecoming a focal point for\nprotest amongst students,\nyet CB W research has been\ngoing on for many years,\nwhy this sudden resurgence\nof interest? One of the\nanswers is to be found in\nthis book. Last February a group of scientists, politicians and journalists from\nseveral countries met to pool\ntheir knowledge on this\nhideous form of warfare.\nTheir interest has been\naroused by a variety of circumstances; naturally a good deal of anxiety was\ndirected towards the United\nStates activity in Vietnam,\nbut worry was also expr e. sed on the existence of\nsecret research establishments in this country and in\nthe US as well as the possibility that University research establishments were\nbeing partially financed by\nthe Defence Dept. in order to\nprovide data for use in CBW\nsituations. The result of\nthese deliberations has been\nthis book edited by Dr.\nStephen Rose of the Biochemistry Dept at IC, which\nis claimed as the most complete dossier on CB W available in open literature.\nWhy have they gone to all\nthis trouble ? The facts revealed in the front part of\nthe book are the more disturbing for being described\nalmost too dispassionately,\ntoo clinically. But what,\napart from causing horror or\ngiving a rather sick thrill to\nthe readers, do the authors\nachieve? They feel the issue\nis too important to remain\nhidden in obscure GovernTlu t riK> from HAIR\nMiiil,it mir hN' I.'i WvndvHanson\nment publications and scientific journals; they want a full public discussion. Al ready they have had some\nconsiderable success\u2014BBC\nTV based their feature \" A Plague on our Children \" on\nthe findings of the confer-en ce. The mainstay of defence has been persuaded to\nrelease rather more of the\nevidence collected by the\nHouse of Commons Select\nCommittee on Science and\nTechnology during tl vi r visit to Porton Down, and\nlast July the Bristol representatives at the Geneva\ndisarmament Conference put\nforward new proposals for\nstrengthening the 43 year\nold protocol on Chemical\nand Bacteriological warfare.\nClearly this is not enough,\nmuch more light needs to be\nshed on our own involvement in CBW. Public opinion must be steered away\nfrom this very natural but\nsentimental revulsion that\nhas so far characterised discussion on this subject, and\nmust be properly informed.\nFor going some way towards\nthis, the Authors and Editor are to be congratulated.\nJOHN SOMMER\nEASTERN EUROPE'S ONE TRACK MIND\nIt probably all started with \" Repulsion \"\u2014the film\nthat is. Clotted with gore and oozing suspense, Roman\nPolanski's necro manic little nicety averted part of the\ncinema goers' gaze from Hollywood's melodrama to\nWarsaw's realism. Many of us\u2014and ALL the critics\u2014\ncontinued looking eastwards as we were alternately terrified\nand revolted with films like \" Onibaba \" (Japan), \" Canal \"\n(Poland) and \" The Round Up \" (Hungary). The National\nFilm Theatre, the Hampstead Everyman and lots of other\ninstitutions catering for minority and more subtle tastes\npeppered their audiences with more and more black and\nwhite celluloid from the Communist Block and at the time\nof writing we have Miklos Jansco rightly elevated to No. 1\nrevolutionary stylist via \" My Way Home.\" and his latest\nduo \" Under Red Stars \" (possibilities!) and \" Silence and\nCry.\" We must also note that Yugoslavia picked up the\nSpecial Jury Award at Cannes (1967) with Patrovic's stark\nfilm \" Happy Gypsies;\" the Czechs got an Academy Award\nfor Mendel's\" Closely Observed Trains\" and at the\nmoment the Paris Pulman is devoting itself to a succession of Commie \" Classics \" which have included Polanski's prize-laden \" A Knife in the Water,\" \" Romance for\na Trumpet\" (Czechoslovakia) and culminating last week\nwith Istvan Szabo's\" Father \" (A) from Hungary which\nwon the Grand Prix at the Moscow film festival of 1967\u2014\nThis is an honest, sensitive and skilful treatment of\na young boy's father-worship which goes too far. The film\nis warmly sentimental when it should be and harshly real\nwhen it has to be but I for one am just a little fed u o with\nthe introspective ness of the crop of films of which this one\nis typical. I'm also bored by the drabness of black and\nwhite, the shabbiness of everyone's clothes, the political\noppression, the shell-pocked buildings and all the other\nOrwellian artefacts which Eastern European films invariably display. I know most of the countries have (and are\nhaving) a lousy time of it\u2014everyone does. But why must\nthese superbly talented directors pervade the medium and\nthe people with their own sob-story. Could be. of course,\nthat by depicting life as iq varia bh so, the film men are\nconsoling the masses with the fact that, as the norm, it IS\ninvariably so\u2014so why worry! And what better way to\nwin fat commissions from Daddy-bear\u2014the Russians. The\nfat carrot of the Grand Prix at the Moscow Film festival\nis dangled, and snatched by the film which casts the least\naspersions on Communism or the Russians after August\n21st, it's good to see the Czech directors back in line for\nIt w oud be incredible it no Felix readers bad yel fie u id of \" Hair \": The tribal love-rock musical from America.\"\nIf you never go to the theatre (and what a waste of living\nin London that is) I would suggest you kick the habit and\ngo at once to the Shaftesbury.\n\" Hair \" concerns a group of hippies and their relations with each other, and with society. With each other\nthey are exuberantly free loving, enjoying sex of any kind\n(one song celebrating this is called \" sodomy\"), and\nturned on (another song is \" Hashish \"). Here are black\nand white, together in their alienation from society.\nThe main characters are Claude (Paul Nicholas),\nBerger (Oliver Tobias) a jid Sheila (Annabel Leventon).\nThey have an interesting inter-relationship.. Claude is hung\non Sheila and Berger, and Berger digs Sheila, Sheila' . . .\nAlso Woof is hung on Mick Jagger ; but it is really against\nthe spirit of Hair' to pick out particular players.\nYet the tribe must somehow relate to the society which\ntries to place demands on them. Family, job. education\nthese orthodoxies are shrugged off. Society then put-- it\nultimate claim upon Claude, and here is the central theme\nof \" Hair.\" The draft\u2014\" White men sending black men\nto kill yellow men, to protect the land they stole, from red\nmen.\" Claude tries to avoid it (\" I want to be here enjoying the things those guys are over there defending \"). but\nhe will not stand up and refuse, burn his draft card. Eventually he submits, and his demise, shorn of his Hair mat ks the close of \" Hair,\" which ends with the song,' \" Lei the\nsun shine through,\" a plea to society.\nThe singing and dancing in \" Hair \" are such that i; would be worth going simply for that. I personally preferred the last, frenetic numbers. The opening number\n\" Aquarius \" and the title \" Hair \" in particular arc superb\nClaude's freak out scene was good, including \" Abie\nBaby \" about Abe Lincoln.\nIf you've spoken much to young Americans you will\nrecognise many things here ; and if not you might understand better what youth in the USA is facing.
