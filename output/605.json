The last two quarters saw\nsome mindless play, notably from Last and\nLeach, who each missed easy goals, and from\nBurnett, who watched in fascination as a shot\nfrom the half-way line sailed past him into\nthe back of the net.

Not even the brick which\ncame Hying through the window was going to\nstop them. So despite having a previously\nuntried penetration system, IC built up a winning lead in the first set only to finally let\nit slip 13-15. As a result it was decided to\nsimplify things a little which resulted in\nImperial raving away to take the set 15-4.\nThe third set proved to be a real cliff-hanger*\nbut IC hung on to take it 15-12, and with it\nTottenham's hopes of winning as after this\nthe Tottenham team just crumbled leaving\nImperial to take the final set 15-4. IC's victory over their nearest rivals was very well\ndeserved considering it was achieved in difficult conditions (the back of the court was\nonly a couple of inches from the gym wall\nwhich made serving in particular very\ndifficult for players not used to such cramped\nconditions) and now gives them an excellent\nchance of winning the league.\nTeam: Peter II., Andy, Peter R., Man, Peter\nDL, Paul.\nHi there readers!

We didn't even break\nany boats which was no minor feet\nconsidering last week's orgy of destruction.\nIn the first race Graham and Richard m^p an excellent start from a heavily port\nbiased line and lead posed, all the way\nround. Two enemy boats, under pressure\nfrom Pat and Mike, collided at the windward\nmark and one of these capsized five minutes\nlater rounding the wing mark. Julian and\nJim showed great potential in a dra<*n out\nrear guard action against the last Surrey boat.\n^\"he second race started with Surrey's captain watching from a grandstand seat on\nhis upturned boat. He had opted for aLc Mans start but, at the crucial moment, discovered that his walking on water act\nneeded a little more practise. Kennedy and\nMills had a great time laying into one of the\nopposition's boats, and knocked it down lo\nthird. Meanwhile Julian and Jim had rejoined battle with 'Crushed Canary' and\nfinished their own vendetta on top.\nWe finished 1, 2; 4 in both races to win I he\nmatch 2-0 (137,pts-30pts). Team: G.

    "content": "Sir\nYour c.on ime ii is about me\nin last week's FELIX editorial\nmust set some sort of record\nlow for this newspaper; in terms not only of accuracy,\nresponsibility, and fairness,\nbut also the abuse of the\nsupposedly unbiased position\nthe editor of a students (or\nany other) newspaper should\noccupy,\n'The assertion that 1 am to\nstand as a candidate for ICU President is clearly in error, as\nyour vaunted \"news\" reporters would have discovered\nhad they explored further\nafield from the FELIX Office\nthan the Union Bar or the\nBot/ Zoo Common Room, had they found time off front\nwatching free film previews in\nthe West End, or from writing\nfatuous swimming articles. In\nfact, a trip only as far as the\nGuilds Union Oft ice to consult\nwith Sue Hartley or Frank\nRowscll would have confirmed that I have no intention of\ncont e sting the job of ICU President. Surely too, if you had\nbothered to personally arrive\non time at IC 1JUG Ms, or\nattend ICU Council, you would have observed that I have proposed only one motion at Council (censuring\nBarney) and have not spoken\nto a motion at aUG M, nor\nindeed have I been a parti-cula rly frequent correspondent in these columns.\nSomebody frantically electioneering would, I believe,\nhave been more zealous in public ising his name, face and\nopinions than I have this year.\nYou continued your tirade\nwith an analysis of my political opinions, describing me as\na wet Tory, about the only\nremotely accurate part of the\neditorial. 1 do not. however,\nbelieve that a politically moderate stance, like the one\nI recently took at I'll' attacking the PCL \"riot in the\nstreets\" brand of occupation\n(something of general student\ninterest you failed to report at\nany time during the weeks the\noccupation lasted) necessarily\nimplies that as ICl\" President\nI would have been a doormat\nfor the Rector to walk all\nover. 1 partie ul a rh resent the\nunsubstantiated allegation\nthat I would under any\ncircumstances sell IC students\ndown the river, and I would\nbe pleased if you would cite\nexamples of my supposed\ninsincerity.\nThe point about your failure to report the PCL riots\nI mentioned above may also\nhave some bearing on your\nproduction of a FELIX wil h two thirds of its front page\ndevoted to a non-news story.\nIn a week when Kings derided\nto stay out of the NUS, when\nthe papers for student posts on\nthe University Senate went\nup, and when the UL Subject\nArea Review Committees( very important for the future\nof the University as a whole)\nreported, I believe your James\nDeeny article was an insult to\nthe intelligence of students at\nIC. Sadly though, such insularity is typical of t he\nxenophobic hatred of anything outside this bit of SW7\nwhich characterises so many\nFELIX Editors. Indeed it is\nprobably my continued interest in UL U and consideration\nof a possible sabbatical election campaign there, on\nissues you probably won't have heard of, let alone care\nabout or understand that\ncaused you to write the editorial you did.\nIn conclusion, as Editor you have a responsible y to\nearn your sabbatical salary by\npublishing a paper containing\nnews, informed comment and\nobjective reporting, very little\nof which was contained in last\nweek's FELIX. You also\npresumably believe your position gives you a good, in\ndepth, knowledge of at least\nI his students' union: your failure, like that of your mentor and immediate pre-dec ess or, to print constructive\ncriticism ol'l'n ion and College\nofficials' actions, as opposed\nto e as v \"knocking copy\" gives\nthe lie to that too.\nChris IIV/;/)\nDear Mr Smith\nI wish lo condemn in no\nuncertain terms your editorial\nregarding Mr Chris Webb. It\nis one of the most vicious\npersonal attacks that I have\nread on anybody in FELIX in\nrecent \\ ears (and that includes\nthose made on Capt Lindley).\nMr Webb, who proposed me\na couple of years ago for Hon Sec. is one of f lie most able\npoliticians in this College and\ndue to this he has over the\nyears had sufficiently a pluralistic attitude to take\npart in affairs beyond the\nwalls of this College.\nThere is nothing wrong in\nbeing a wet tory and as one of\nour former Prime Ministers\n(Edward Heath) has pointed\nout there is every possibility of\nwet lori es and social democrats working together.\nI therefore think that you\nshould publish a full retraction\nof your totally unwarranted\nattack on Mr Webb.\nTours\nFrank James\nPS: I assume that all the\npublicity rules for this coming\nelection have been torn up\n(not only by yourself 1 might\nadd).\nSir\nI am writing to condemn\nyour attack on Chris Webb in\nyour editorial last week.\nAttacks on myself are fair as 1\nam elected to a\" public\" position and should expect\npublic, criticism. Your criticisms of me this year have been\na little uninspired, but more\nof that in later weeks. Attacks\non my predecessor, John Passmore, are irrelevant to a significant section of your\nreadership, but again expected as he has held the\nsenior post in ICU.( Inciden-tally, John's apparent laziness\nmay be attributable to the\nway your predecessor wrecked\nhis motivation). However, attacks on a potential presidential candidate are completely out of order and could\ncause irreparable damage to a' campaign.\nAs Chris will not (actually\ncannot thanks to your editor-i al) now stand for I he post of\nI ClI President, 1 am able to\ngo on record as saying, with\ndue respect to other potential\ncandidates, that 1 think Chris\nwould have been the best man\nfor the job.\nChris is an excellent orator\nand has wo ike d hard for\nstudents (at IC and elsewhere)\nin the past. Sincerity is a word\nI would use in describing him.\nTo slate Chris is political and\nambitious is hardly to insult\nhim. His politics do not agree\nwith mine, but I know Chris\nhas a genuine concern for I he\nway any government's policies\naffect students\u2014an awareness\nmany students here would be\nadvised to develop.\nI suspect vo u wrote your\neditorial in the belief that\nChris would not stand for\nICl* President. I would question the reliability of your\nsource of information in forming that belief ami ask\nyou if you had contemplated\nthe possibility Chris might\nchange his mind over the next\nfew weeks. Whilst appreciating your desire for a lively\nand informed election cam-pai gn,I believe you could\nhave prevented an excellent\ncandidate from running for\nPresident.\nII is possible Chris Webb\nmay decide to run for a University of London sabbatical post. If he does, I hope\nmany IC students will offer\nsupport to a sincere and articulate candidate.\nTours faithfully\nNick Morton\nPresident, ICU Dear Sir\n1 was dismayed on Friday\nmorning to read in FELIX that my colleague and fellow\ndegenerate, Mr James Deeny,\nhad supposedly embarked upon a keep-fit campaign.\nCould this be, 1 wondered,\nthe same James Deeny I had\nseen that very morning at\nGloucester Road wandering\nhaphazardly towards the tail\nend of a9:30 lecture amidst a miasma of foul, cancerous\nfumes being emitted from a cigarette clenched between\nhis decaying teeth, and nursing the brain-numbing\nresults of the previous evening's alcoholic excesses?\nTours sincerely\nDecrepit of Hammersmith\nPage 2 FELIX, February 12, 1982\n\n"

For those who are\nnew to this column, I should point out that pure\nmathematicians are perfectly truthful, whereas\napplied mathematicians invariably lie, and\nWodge amused himself by letting each of the\nten people present make one statement about\nthe others, and then working out who belonged to which department.\nLen was the first to talk to Wodge. \"If the\nhead of department is applied,\" he said \"then\nMichael is pure, but Nick is applied.\" \" On the\nother hand,\" put in Oliver,\" the head of\ndepartment is pure if and only if Peter is\napplied and Quentin is pure.\" \" DidI hear you\nmention Peter?\" asked Richard. \"If he and I are\nboth applied then Michael isn't, but if either of\nus isn't, then he is.\" \"If you want to know\nabout Michael, I'd have a few words with\nStephen,\" said Nick. \" You can believe at least\none of them.\"\" DidI hear you mention Stephen?\" asked Quentin. \"He's friendly with\nLen and Oliver, and at least one of the three is\napplied.\" \" How can you mistrust Oliver?\"\nexclaimed Michael. \"He's as truthful as Iam!\" \"If I'm a pure mathematician,\" said Tony,\n\" then Stephen, Len and the head of\ndepartment are not all applied.\"\n\"Having trouble?\" asked Peter helpfully. \"If\nin doubt, guess pure, since over half of us are\ntruthful.\" \" On the contrary,\" said Stephen.\n\" Over half of us are untruthful.\"\nHaving elicited one statement each from nine\nof the ten present, Wodge went over to talk to\nthe head of the department. Unfortunately\nhe was rather the worse for wine, and Wodge\ncouldn't get anything coherent out of him at\nall. Not that it mattered, of course, since he\nhad already deduced that who is what?\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office please.

TAYLOR\nMonday\n15th, February\n7:30pm Mech Eng 220\nFootball\nThirds\nThe Thirds feasted on the visual delights of\nthe gorgeous ladies' hockey team for almost\ntwo hours! This aesthetic disp aly inspired us\nto decide that only ten men were needed to\nstitch up second placed QM C II. This strategy worked well with Dave Hardy smashing an early goal into the roof of their\nnet, and as we continued to attack purposefully he twice nearly scored again.\nThe game was becoming a stroll so we\ndecided Dave would have to be taken off. A QM C defender duly obliged with a tackle\nfrom behind saving us the bother. Even with\nnine men the match was too one-sided so Kev Tea han was given the easiest of tap-ins past\nDuncan Brown( their forwards being incapable of scoring). Neil Redmayne then\nsmashed the most delicate of through balls\npast their hopelessly split defence, allowing\nNick Flannagan to take the ball in his stride\nand score with a searing left-footer from well\noutside the box. In the true spirit of IC fair\nplay we allowed QM C to equalise with the\nll uki est of headers\u2014after all it would have\nbeen terribly rude lo beat our hosts with only\nnine men. Team: D. Broun, (',. Herns, , V. Redmayne, M. Powell, A'. Teahan, D. Hardy* M. Higham, S. Lister, 1. Archer, .V. Flanagan.\nBowling\nOn Wednesday, February 3, two and a hall\nteams set oil for Southampton Bowl to play\nthe last league of the Southern Division. After\na few mishaps we arrived live minutes late.\nUnfortunately without a ladies team we\nlost that game before we started. The C team\nlost their game 3-1. In the first frame they\nwere beaten by over 100 pins, but lost\nnarrowly in the second frame by only 20 pins.\nThe star of the team and of the day was Jell'\nQuinn who got three 169 scores to give him\nhis first 500+ series the hard way.\nThe B team lost 4-0 and in one game got a lower score than the C team. This was\ngenerally disappointing as we thought they\nmight do well with some promising new\nplayers. The A team through good teamwork\nwon 3-1 and only lost their last game by\nabout 20 pins.\nft Hockey\nFirsts\nI Imperial made a somewhat tentative start\nagainst a full strength St Thomas' team.\nAfter twenty minutes Tommies caught the IC defence admiring I anD rivers thighs by\nconverting a free hit from the top of the D. With thoughts of last year's close match, IC were soon another goal behind. The Imperial\ndefence hung on and with a minute remaining Bell and (/arms tangled well on the\nbreak and G arms drilled the ball home\nfrom the widest of angles. Thus a shocked\nImperial side went into the second hall\nputting he opposition under remarkable pressure. Then an entirely unprovoked incident between Franklin and the centre\nforward saw the latter receiving a yellow card\nand within a minute Imperial were 1-3 down.\nWith St Thomas and Imperial both thinking\nthe game was over, Bateson proceeded to\nscore 2 spectacular goals. St Thomas pressed\nhard for the remainder of the second half but\nthe defence coped well with Drivers six iron\nclip shots and R. Dodds runs.\nThe first half of extra time saw St Thomas\ncontinuing where they left oil with both Riley\nand in the second half, Coatesworth making\nstops on the line. But with five minutes\nremaining, just as Riley was pondering on\nthe technicalities ol pl lick taking, St Thomas\nscored.\nTeam: Slatter, Coatesworth, Riley, Parker,\nAy res, Rao, Franklin, Bateson, Garms, Bell\nCray.\nLadies\nContinuing our tremendous form we\ncompleted our third successive annihilation\nof the season. This week our unfortunate\nopponents were QM C who were either completely useless or simply stunned by our\nskill.\nThe fact that we only had nine players and\nno goalie did little to deter us and good\n(lowing play throughout the team produced\nsome excellent chances. We could have had\nat least a dozen and probably would have\ndone but for some fine saves from their\ngoalie and some slightly oil target shooting\nfrom us ( particularly the halves). One uncharacteristic lax moment from the\nPage 10 FELIX, February 12, 1982\n\n"

    "content": "What do you want to know about Welfare Week for? After all,\nyou're not sick. Mummy and Daddy told you all about the birds\nand bees ages ago, and perhaps you're onto the 'practical' by\nnow. It's bound to be boring, anyway. Well, in my time at IC I 've\ncome across some pretty weird misconceptions and some\nextremely naive attitudes, not to mention a fair number of\nunreasonable viewpoints. What we're aiming to do is to provide a factual background and an open forum for discussion on a few of\nthese points, and maybe even a bit of fun (shock, horror!). It's up\nto you if you want to come along or not, but it's taking up a fair\namount of your money, so you may as well come along and make\nit worthwhile.\nGlad to be Gay?\nFrom most people's attitudes in this place you may think that it's pretty\nodd to be gay\u2014something dirty or whatever. Yet statistically there are\nprobably as many as 500 gays at IC. So, if you've found that you are (or\nmight be) gay you're almost certainly not as alone as you felt.\nBut what does it feel like to be gay? Is it any 'different'? How do you\nbecome gay\u2014is it a disease (yes, people actually believe that), is it inborn\nor a result of background? I don't know, but come along and discuss\nit\u2014whether you're gay yourself, or consider gays as \"fucking queers\" or\n\"raving po uf s\" it's likely there'll be something to gain.\nI 've noticed that many people find it threatening to be in the company\nof someone who is gay\u2014apparently they think that they're just about to\nleap on them or something\u2014but perhaps a word: do you find every girl\n(or guy) you come across ir resist ably attractive? Chances are he/she\nfinds you as unattractive as you find him/her.\n0,\nFilms\nOn show all Wednesday afternoon.\nJust One The effect of that one drink on your\nsystem is quite surprising. Find out!\nThe Least You Can Do A moderately serious\nview of contraception.\nDrinking Drinking more sodding drinking\u2014but\nyou almost all do too much!\n'Ave you got a male assistant miss?

Upper Lounge\nThe Fuzz\nHave you got the greatest of respect for the Police Force? Not everyone\nhas\u2014the more scruffy amongst us tend to represent prime targets for\nsearching for drugs, breath aly sing and so on, and it doesn't tend to leave\nyou with too good an image when you've just been made twenty minutes\nlate for an important meeting (I know!). Yet they do need to do their job\nsomehow (or are you an anarchist?). If you have either viewpoint, or\ncould put forward any suggestions, come along Thursday lunchtime and\nvoice your views.\nSex can be a Problem\nRight now your only problem may be \"getting it down\" at embarrassing\ntimes. Yet it might frighten you that it has been estimated that one in\ntwelve women suffer from frigidity, and that one in twenty men suffer\nfrom impotence. It's not something many of us discuss much\u2014and\nperhaps you didn't know of the treatments available (I sure didn't). This\nfilm will be followed by a discussion headed by a representative of\n'Grapevine'\u2014a young peoples sexual counselling agency (amongst other\nthings)\u2014come along to either or both.\nAttention Links/Chaps/22/Field Cup\nContestants\nAround IC it's the accepted thing to go for a drink with your mates. Fine,\nbut we all know that drinking can be a problem. When does social\ndrinking become a problem? Ten pints a week? Twenty? It's difficult to\nknow, but I was shocked when I found out just how much alcohol affects\nthe system, and how long the effects last. Perhaps the most sobering\nthought (excuse the pun) was brought home by the film Just One\n(showing Wednesday afternoon). I always thought one drink did nothing\nto me and that two or three had little more effect\u2014but I found I was\nwrong. Obviously cirrhosis of the liver isn't the only possible problem.\nIf you've been going to the pub more than four or five times a week\u2014if\nyou've really got into practice so that you can handle eight or ten pints,\nthen the chances are that you might be doing yourself serious harm.\nPlease pick up a questionnaire from the display in the Union Lower\nLounge (a leaflet as well if you like) and fill it in\u2014with luck we can get\nsome statistics for College. In any case please come along 10 the talk by\nthe London Council on Alcoholism and find out just what you're doing to\nyourself!\nGale Is Dead\nGale was nineteen and pretty. She'd been taken into care at the age of six\nmonths and in the intervening years had been in fourteen different\ninstitutions. She became a drug addict. Now Gale is dead. Perhaps a life\nwhere nothing went right, but perhaps not so different from your own.\nFor those who didn't see this film on BBC Horizon in 1970 it's a must.\nA tragic story, but it should be of interest to everyone.\nDrugs\nI guess that nearly everyone at College has come across drugs at some\ntime. (Note, that includes tobacco and alcohol by definition!), and whether\nor not you support the legal is ation of cannabis you must agree that\nsome drugs do have very harmful effects. But because it's illegal, drugs is\nnot a subject that is often discussed, and perhaps you might be tempted\nto 'try them out' to see what they're like. Just what are the effects (both\npleasurable and harmful) of specific drugs? What is truth and what is\nmyth? Just what does the law say? These are all things I'm not sure about\n(perhaps you are!), and there's a chance to ask all these questions (and\nmore) at the discussion lead by the community drug project (Wednesday\nafternoon).\nAbortion\nIt's a pretty emotive subject and whether you're a firm believer in the\n\"women's right to choose\" or the \"rights of the unborn child\" this often\nstirs up a lot of feeling. But yet this is often allowed to cover up facts that\nare important, leaving the pregnant party bewildered and mixed up to say\nthe least. Are the fears of future sterility well founded or rubbish (or\nsomething in between)? Can your GP stall you until it's too late? What\nwill an abortion cost? See the stall in the Union Lower Lounge to find out,\nany time during the week.\nRape\n\"Well, it's good for a laugh.\"\n\"All women need a good raping anyway.\"\n\"They enjoy it.\"\nFor anyone who thinks any of these are true, perhaps I can straighten\nout a few misconceptions. Rape is a very serious business\u2014if \"they enjoy\nit\", then it just isn't rape\u2014something more like the truth might include\nviolence (beating, \"cutting\", etc.), anal and/or oral as well as normal sex\nand other enforced degradation (the attacker might urinate or def aec ate on the victim for instance). Pretty sickening picture isn't it? It seems to be\nsomething accepted in our \"male dominated society' that women only\nexist to \"get laid\" and that if some girl is wearing attractive clothing she's out to \"get a man\". This leads to many of the misconceptions that can\nlead to rape. If you want to know more, please pick up one of the leaflets\nthat'll be around, or come and see me and I 'll lend you a copy of the Rape\nCrisis Centre's report.\nIC Welfare Plug\nBelieve it or not, IC has quite a good range of welfare facilities\u2014almost\nwhatever's wrong there's bound to be someone to go to see.\nHealth Centre this boasts three full-time doctors and nursing/ administrative staff to match, a large sick bay and various visiting\nspecialists (including an ac cup unc tur is t!). They're all to be found in 14\nPrinces Gardens.\nStudent Counsellor-Don 'hangs out' in the basement of number 15\nPrinces Gardens and spends his time talking to students about anything\nthat is bothering them; from workload to home environment and beyond.\nSo why not go and see him if you have a problem-it's absolutely\nconfidential so no-one else will know.\nStudent Services-This includes the accommodation office (medium-large amounts of College and private sector accommodation) to sort out\nsomewhere to live and the 'Welfare Bit' to help out with practical\nproblems (landlord hassles, rent rebates, signing on, rights, etc.) and\nanything else that you can't think where to go for\u2014if they don't know,\nthey'll probably know where you can find out.\nNightline-This has the great advantage of being open at night rather\nthan during the day-if you're feeling a bit down or would like to chat about\nsomething there's always someone there during term time(6:00 pm8:00 am). They've got a fair selection of info too on Ents, films, discos,\ntransports; you name it! And they'll find you somewhere to find out if they\ncan't tell you themselves. Sounds impressive, doesn't it? To find how it\nreally works, drop in some time to the basement of 9 Princes Gardens or\nring them on 581-2468.\nDay Nursery-For anyone with preschool age children, this can be a great help-it runs throughout the year (not just during term time) and has\nskilled and experienced staff. There's even a grants scheme for anyone\nwho can't afford the full fees-but unfortunately there's often a waiting list,\nso if you think you might want to use it try to let them know in advance\nPage 6 FELIX, February 12, 1982 FELIX, February 12, 1982 Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "Following last week's editorial, three\narticles have been received on elections...\nReversing the\ntrend\nby J Martin Taylor\nThe last two years have seen a sad decline in\nthe ability of the Union to have any real effort\non events in College. Of course we are\nconsulted and sometimes even listened to, but\nall too often we are ignored. The reason for\nthis is the deliberate policy of 'co-operation' of\nthe last two years.\nJohn Passmore, who it is clear in retrospect\nwas out of his depth as President, was elected\npledging to increase co-operation with College\nafter the more confrontation-type policies of\nthe previous two Presidents, Mary Attenborough and Chris Fox. This, together\nwith the fact that John Passmore makes' Barney McCabe appear industrious, has led to\nthe state of affairs we now see, where 'anything\nfor a quiet life' seems to have become the\nPresidential role. Nick Morton, although very\nlikeable and well intention ed, has failed to\nreverse this. I'm sure he gets on very well with\nthe Rector, Mr Mooney, etc. He should do,\nbecause he rarely, if ever, causes them any\nproblems. Hence the 'quiet life' approach has\nspread to the College authorities, who have\nconsequently slipped into a comfortable\ncomplacency.\nI should point out here that Iam not\nsuggesting that we should hold occupations or\ntake other forms of disruptive action, except\nas a last resort. But the Union has been sadly\nlacking any firm, decisive leadership over the\nlast two years. Co-operation has gone too far\nwhen 'the Rector and the President of the\nStudents' Union decided' on a mid-session\nrent increase( to quote from Student Residence Committee minutes) in direct\ncontradiction of Union policy. Then Nick Morton says he didn't consider a rent strike\nbecause 'nobody proposed one'. Frightened of\nannoying the Rector, Nick? In the words of\nMark Smith, if we can't rely on the President to\nlead, then who will?\nIn these increasingly difficult times the\nUnion needs strong leadership, which means\nnot being afraid ot annoying or criticizing\nCollege 'dignitaries' when they deserve it. It\nmeans standing up for students' interests and\nnot adopting the laissez-faire attitudes seen\nover the last two years. It means leading in a definite direction, rather than attempting to\ndrift with the tide and please all of the people\nall of the time, which is only possible if you do\nnothing( as Nick Morton is belatedly discovering).\nIn short: co-operation, yes; but when it\nreaches the extent of acquiescence to\neverything College comes up with, then it has\ngone too far. The Union has become little\nmore than a branch of the College administration when more than ever it needs to be\nfighting the students' corner. This trend must\nbe reversed now. Comeback Mary Attenborough and Chris Fox, all is forgiven!\n1982 Presidential\nElection\nby Andrew Lyall\nIt cannot have escaped the notice of any\nstudent who has been at IC for more than a year and quite possibly many of those who\narrived at the beginning of this year that ICU is\na fast declining institution held in contempt by\nmany of its ordinary members. This is a tragic\nthing to have happened to the instrument that\nrepresents the students of one of the most\nimportant academic institutions in the world.\nTraditionally the sabbatical Union Officers\nstrenuously blame this on the ordinary members, who they say are boring, apathetic\nand not interested in the Union. What amazes\nme is that after pathetic exhibitions like the last\nU GM they should be at all surprised by the\nnon-interest. I have been at IC now for five\nyears and my own experience does not tally\nwith this commonly held view. The old joke\nabout boring scientists and engineers is simply\nnot true. One only needs to look at the many\nvery active clubs and societies and the large\nnumber of events that take place every week\nto realise that IC is overflowing with interesting\nand intelligent people.\nNo the truth is very far from this. The\nproblem lies in the fact that in recent years the\nUnion has been represented by the very small\nminority of students at IC who are boring.\nThose people who view the Union as a vehicle\nfor cos set ing their own egos and providing\nthem with a glass of sherry when something\nEffective\nleadership\nby Stephen Goulder\nThe most important single factor effecting ICU next year will be the increase in its grant. This\nincrease will be not more than 5%, which is well\nshort of the rate of inflation. This is arguably\nfair since College itself is having to sustain a cut of 20% in its expenditure over the next\nthree years.\nIn view of this any changes made under the\nregime of the next ICU President must be cost\neffective. All the election pledges of the\nprospective candidates must be seen in this\nlight. For example we can only bring the Union\nRefectory under Union control if it is going to\ngenerate a profit in the short and medium\nterm. I have used this example because it is the\npledge most often made but (as usual) never\nkept, indeed accurate costings of the Union\nRefectory have never been made by the\nUnion. This is one good reason to treat every\nelection candidate with healthy scepticism.\nThis need for an appreciation of the\neconomic climate is most obvious in the antics\nof Mr Nick Morton and the Bar Committee.\nHis committee apparently intends to have a bust of Prince Albert in the Southside Bar in\naddition to a coloured print of Prince Albert's coat of arms and various Victorian prints at a cost of \u00a3750. This is utter waste and an\nextravagance that any President should have\nstopped immediately.\nThere is also inefficiency in the Union administration itself which must be cut. In\nparticular Union Finance Committee must\nhave a more effective policy governing the\nexpenses that most clubs have in common. In\nupsets them. They may well be nice people\u2014in\nfact having known almost all of them I know\nthis to be so, but they have not been leaders,\nand worse they have not been interested in\nthe membership. In my view there is a wealth\nof talent and potential interest and involvement\npresent among the membership waiting for a suitable President to be elected.\nThe normal procedure for electing a Union\nPresident relies on candidates who have been\n\"brought up through the ranks\" in the Union\nway of thinking and after the votes have been\ncounted they take a single step sideways and\nsit down in the Presidential chair. These people are easily recognizable and 1 urge you\nnot to vote for them as they are totally\nunsuited for the position of President.\nThis is going to be a very important year for\nstudents at IC. The IC/Q EC merger is still\nlurking in the background and the student\ngrant has received a substantial cut in real\nterms. The British education system has a history of political tinkering and it is important\nthat the elected representatives of ICU should\nresist any attempt to break the mould of the\nBrit'sh education system against the interest of\nthe universities and students concerned. This\nissue of merges is a far wider one and effects\nnot only IC/Q EC students. Have you heard of\nthe Bedford/Birkbeck merge for example?\nBack at College a private caterer has at last\nbroken the Mooney monopoly and discussions\nabout an NUS referendum are starting again.\nA lot of important decisions are going to\nhave to be made this coming year and it is of\nvital importance to elect a President who is not\ngoing to let himself be pushed around and is\ndedicated to making the Union effectual and\nmore relevant to its members.\nparticular laying down norms for publicity and\nspeakers expenses. They have already taken\nsteps to effectively put the clubs that need to\nbuy large items of equipment onto five year\nplans (hence spreading the load over five\nyears). This must be carried on by next year's Executive.\nIn the fields of Academic Affairs and External Affairs the President plays a leading\nrole. Again it is the expenditure cuts that\ngovern the range of problems that will crop up.\nWe must fight to keep a firm commitment to\nteaching in all departments rather than let it be\nsacrificed to save current research. The public\nspending cuts generally mean that we are\nwitnessing a rationalization of London University as a whole. Thus to be an effective\nvoice next year we must have an integrated\nresponse from the student unions of London\nUniversity.\nI hope it is apparent that next session we\nmust have a President who has some experience of the way both College and Union\nworks. Uninformed election pledges can\nseldom be implemented.\nIt is clear that the Union has lost its direction\nover the last two years. This has occured\nbecause the sabbaticals have failed to relate to\nmany students and have been content to wait\nin the Union Bar for the masses to come to\nthem. But perhaps the most fatal error made\nby Mr Morton and Mr Passmore is that they\nassumed that by sitting on committees they\nwere actually being effective. They were in fact\nbecoming ever more isolated in the Union\nOffice never making any real effort to talk to\nordinary students. They thus exchanged relevant feedback for hack is t syco phan cy. Thus I urge you to vote for a candidate who\nis at least partly experienced in Union affairs,\nwilling to argue the Union cause effectively,\nand most importantly willing to get out of his\noffice and meet students around College.\nPage 4 FELIX, February 12, 1982\n\n"

Our fort-nightly weekend trip was to\nSnowdonia last weekend. We stayed in a comfortable hut in the\nOgywn Valley and went climbing\non Try far and walking on the\nGly der s on Saturday. Better weather on Sunday encouraged ail\nof us to go for an interesting\ntraverse of the Carnedd group of\npeaks. Fine weather gave us\nbreathtaking views of most of\nSnowdonia. After a meal at the\nhut we returned to College.\nYesterday's meeting was a trip\nup the Queen's Tower to yet\nanother interesting view of\nLondon's skyline. Next week's regular meeting will be a talk on\nPhotography by an expert from\nthe RCA, in Mines 303 at 12:30pm. The next weekend trip is on\nFebruary 19 to 21 and is a service\nproject at the Na'in al Scout\nboating centre in '. iar low on Thames.\nFor further details of all events\nsee us at \"Butties\" in the South\nside Upper Lounge above the bar\nevery lunchtime.\nSoc Soc\nOn Tuesday, February 16, there\nwill be representatives present\nfrom' Women for Life' and Women's Voice speaking on the\nsubject of abortion.

We're always ready for an\nargument, so see you there.\nWing Chun\nNo doubt if you've been reading\nour previous articles in FELIX you'll be well aware of the history\nand traditions of Wing Chun, so I won't bore you all again. Instead\nI 'll try to give you a small idea\nabout the non-physical side of the\nart.\nWing Chun places great emphasis on the training of the mind\nfor without the right attitude one\ncannot train the body. The student is encouraged to find his\nown way through the art, to\nquestion and criticize techniques\nbefore he accepts them, until he\nfeels confident that the techniques\nwill help him when the need arises.\nThe instructor's job is to guide the\nstudent through the various stages, to help him realize his\nmistakes and how to correct them. Hence training is carried\nout in a relaxed atmosphere allowing the student to think about techniques instead of\nblindly accepting them.\nIn writing this article I can only\ngive you a small idea about Wing\nChun, so if you would like to know\nmore, don't by shy, we are always\nglad to have new members and\nbefore I forget: we meet in the\nUnion Gym on Wednesday after-noon s,3:00pm and on Saturday\nmornings at 9:30am.
