It blazed like a\nmeteor through the inky black skies,\nand the people on board, quite naturally,\nbegan to panic. The pilot wrestled with\nthe failing controls while the co-pilot\nentered the aisle, telling the passengers\nthat things would be alright, and that\nthey would make it through this. He sat\nbeside a crying woman and comforted\nher. He gave her hope, even as flames\nclimbed the wings and the craft spiralled\ndownwards.\nThe pilot was killed immediately in\nthe crash, along with thirteen others.\nThesurvivorsweretrappedinthemiddle\nof a vast wasteland, with little hope\nof rescue. The co-pilot, however, took\ncharge. He led a party of passengers for\nmiles across the desert. Eventually they\nfound a village and telephoned for help.\nThe co-pilot, whose name was Gene\nRoddenberry, saved two dozen lives.\nEighty years later, another airplane\nis on fire. Its descent is on the timescale\nof decades, and its passenger number\nin the billions. For a long time, most of\nthe windows have been closed, but now\nthe blaze is rattling the glass \u2013 now the\nheat is impossible to ignore. Scorching\nsummers, rain-flooded winters.

I\u2019m sure it weighs on\nyoulikeitdoesonme.Itmakesyouwant\nto grab an oxygen mask and just curl up\nunder your seat, waiting for the end.\n\u2018Climate defeatism\u2019 is a relatively\nnew term. Also called \u2018eco-grief\u2019,\nit disproportionately affects young\npeople, as well as those involved in the\nnatural sciences. As STEM students,\nwe are Ground Zero for this eruption\nof despondency. People feel that the\nenvironment is irrevocably damaged,\nthat they will grow old in a world of\nnatural disasters, mass extinctions, and\necological devastation. Worse, they feel\nthat, as members of the human race,\nthey are somehow to blame. That we\nare a blight upon the surface of our own\nplanet, and it will suffer at our hands as\nlong as we exist.\nThis malaise, as I see it, originates\nfrom two main sources. The first, I\u2019m\nafraid to say, is climate scientists. Every\napocalyptic climate report is delivered\nwith the message: \u2018Act now, because\nsoon it will be too late!\u2019. A narrative of\n\u2018Tipping Points\u2019 and \u2018Final Warnings\u2019 is\neffective in conveying a palpable sense\nof danger, but it has its weaknesses. If\nsomeone reads a headline proclaiming\nthat the \u2018Point Of No Return\u2019 is about\nto be crossed, they may, after two more\nyears of little progress, assume that\nthere is nothing more to be done. They\nmay assume that we have, in a general\nsense, failed.\nThey would be wrong. The tipping\npoints are setbacks, certainly, but until\nthe oceans themselves boil away there\nwill always be something that can be\ndone. Change will always be possible,\nand it will always be fruitful. That is not\nto suggest that we be flippant about it;\nthe time we waste is measured in future\nlives lost. But never think that it is too\nlate to act. The best time for reversal may\nhave been fifty years ago, but the second-best will always be the present moment.\nThe second cause of climate defeatism\nis the corporations that are the cause\nof climate change in the first place. It\ndoesn\u2019t take a conspiracy theorist to see\nthat pessimism benefits the companies\nthat have been wringing the planet dry\nfor decades. They are trying to shift the\nblameontous,tomakeusforgetwhothe\ntrue architects of this crisis are. We are\nadmonished about our personal carbon\nfootprint by people that fill our oceans\nwith oil and clog the sky with their coal\nsmoke.\nGuilt and hopelessness flourish in\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n22 comment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nClimate defeatism: an engineered despair\nDaniel Hesk Comment Writer\nCOMMENT\nDaniel Hesk evaluates and critiques the culture of climate defeatism, urging readers to take action against those who\nare the true cause of climate change.\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons, People vs. Fossil Fuels\nUNTIL THE\nOCEANS\nTHEMSELVES\nBOIL AWAY THERE\nWILL ALWAYS BE\nSOMETHING THAT\nCAN BE DONE\n\u201c\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\n\u2018We have to shift our focus away from what we failed to do, and towards what we can do.\u2019 \u2018As long as us humans are willing to act for the greater good, there will still be hope.\u2019\nComment\nEdited by: Elif Civelekoglu\n\n"

    "content": "Felix was two days away from being\nseven months clean of running a\nbullying headline. Unfortunately,\nit seems that despite all the surface\ncommitments, little has changed in\na university rocked so recently by\na bullying scandal which garnered\nnational press attention. The\ninvestigation into the treatment of\nSecurity staff here at Imperial provides\ndamning evidence that a bullying\nculture pervades the College.\nThe officers\u2019 experience with Human\nResources (HR) is a worrying\nindicator that this \u201cbullying culture\u201d\ntranscends the Security team and even\ntheir umbrella department, Campus\nServices. In fact, the obstinance and\ncollusion with management exhibited\nby members of HR begs the question\nof just how equipped they are to deal\nwith unfair treatment of employees\nacross the university. By showing\nhow Human Resources have failed\nto mediate between officers and\nmanagement, leaving staff feeling\n\u201cbetrayed\u201d, this investigation may have\nalso shone a light on how a culture\nof bullying has persisted at Imperial.\nFurthermore, the insufficiency of the\ngrievance process points to a failure in\nthe College complaints procedure.\nHowever, the Security officers\u2019 plight\nis heightened by the fact that they lack\nrepresentation by recognised trade\nunions. Having been failed by Unison,\nmost of Security is now represented\nby GMB, whose ability to protect\nofficers\u2019 rights is ultimately limited\nby the union\u2019s lack of recognition\nby the College. On the other hand,\nrecognition alone may not be the\nsolution; whilst recognised union\nUnite did attempt to protect the\nSecurity officers\u2019 rights, they had little\nsuccess.\nOne of the issues raised by Security\nstaff is the increase in sub-contracting\nby the College. They fear that they\nwill eventually be replaced by agency\nstaff. This favouring towards agency\nstaff is a symptom of casualisation;\nthe increasing use of Diligence and\nthe rise in zero-hour contracts (which\nUCU members aim to \u201cstamp out\u201d)\nare two sides of the same coin. The\nkey difference, however, is that whilst\nacademic staff have been striking in\npart because of this issue, security\ndon\u2019t even have the power to do that.\nIn a final stand, security have created\na petition to the Provost, asking\nthat their jobs and overtime cease to\nbe threatened by replacement with\nagency staff.\nLast week, a member of Security\npersonnel informed HR that they\nwere speaking to Felix. Shortly\nafterwards, that same member of staff\nhad an overtime shift he had signed\nup for cut. Several Security officers\nhad previously informed me that\nthey believed cutting overtime is one\nof the bullying tactics used by their\nsupervisors and management to keep\nthem in line. Having heard officers\u2019\nstories, I would not be surprised if this\nis the case, and I fully condemn such a\nshameless and blatant attempt to bully\nSecurity staff into submission and into\nsilence.Felixwillbecloselymonitoring\nthe treatment of Security staff\nfollowing publication of this article.\nIsabella Ward\n2\nJamie John NewsEditor\nIsabella Ward\nNewsEditor\nSportand\nSocietiesEditor\nAngie Lo ScienceEditor\nTaylor Pomfret ScienceEditor\nMarie Mori\nEnvironment\nEditor\nSimran Patel\nEnvironment\nEditor\nElif Civelekoglu\nComment\nEditor\nIsaac Winson PuzzlesEditor\nAmy Smith CatnipEditor\nGilbert Jackson ArtsEditor\nSophie Pointon ArtsEditor\nZanna Buckland BooksEditor\nJoe Riordan MusicEditor\nTara Palchaudhuri MusicEditor\nJonah Hewett\nFilmandTV\nEditor\nMike Buzadji\nFilmandTV\nEditor\nCharlotte Probstel\nFoodandTravel\nEditor\nSportand\nSocietiesEditor\nNatalie Yu HeadIllustrator\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of:\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors!\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nFair recognition\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\nTwitter: @feliximperial\nFacebook: @FelixImperial\nInsta: @felix_imperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton, Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2023\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix, we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to be\nin the know.

    "content": "A safer Imperial\nImperial College Union President Hayley Wong explains the latest changes to the College\u2019s disciplinary process.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nCOMMENT\nThe College\u2019s disciplinary procedure\nhas been one of the prevailing\nissues raised to the Union by students.\nThat is why both mine and Nathalie\u2019s\nmanifestos prioritised pushing for\nimprovements in this area. Whilst the\nprocedure itself was structurally sound\nand compliant with guidelines from the\nOffice of the Independent Adjudicator\n(OIA), students involved in disciplinary\ncases have lamented over a lack of\ntransparency, the length of time needed\nto conclude their cases, and the mental\ntoll taken by going through the process.\nOver30%ofstudentshaveexperienced\nsexual misconduct, according to the\n2021 Sexual Misconduct Survey\ncarried out by Imperial College Union.\nHowever, over the 5-year period of\n2016 to 2021, only 12 cases have been\ninvestigated under the College\u2019s Student\nDisciplinary Procedures, indicating a\nlack of trust in these procedures. It was\nalso found that a significant majority of\nsexual misconduct survivors chose not\nto seek any support from the College\nor the Union, with the most common\nreason being that they \u2018did not think\nthere would be any action taken\u2019.\nThere were many issues with what the\nprocedure used to be, for example:\n\u2022 There were insufficient updates to\nstudents between the acknowledgement\nof receipt of the case and the conclusion\nof the case.\n\u2022 There was no parity of appeal rights,\ni.e., the student responding to an\nallegation of misconduct (responding\nparty) could appeal the outcome or\nsanction(s), but the person making the\ncomplaint (reporting party) could not\ndo the same.\n\u2022 Students were not allowed to go into\nhearings with a legal representative,\neven though it was ruled by a High\nCourt judge in March 2020 that legal\nrepresentation should be permitted on\na case-by-case basis to ensure natural\njustice in these types of proceedings.\n\u2022 The College always paused\ninvestigations if police become involved\nin the case \u2013 often this meant the case\ncould not be concluded for years,\nleading to involved students graduating\nwithout an outcome.\n\u2022 The length of time required to close a\ncase (some have taken several years to be\nconcluded).\n\u2022 There was no opportunity provided\nto reopen a case once it was concluded,\neven when new evidence was presented.\n\u2022 There was a lack of structured\nsupport for students going through the\nprocess.\n\u2022 The available sanctions that the\nprocedure could impose were limited,\nwhich meant that in some cases they\nweren\u2019t the most appropriate for those\ncircumstances.\n\u2022 Fining people as a sanction\ndisproportionately punishes students\nfrom financially disadvantaged\nbackgrounds.\nAnd perhaps worst of all:\n\u2022 The reporting party often did not get\ninformed of the outcome of their case,\nnor any sanctions put in place.\nThese issues were detrimental to\nstudents going through the process. This\nis why Nathalie, Jason and I have spent\na significant amount of time this year\nattempting to elevate the student voice\non this important issue. At the start of\nlast academic year, Nathalie initiated a\nCollege-wide review of these procedures\nby conducting a survey of sexual\nmisconduct (with over 600 responses)\nand bringing a paper to Union Council.\nThis prompted the College to put\ntogetheraworkinggroupconsistingofus\nthree and staff from across the College,\nas well as a practicing barrister (who\nhappened to be the Union President\nin 2000/01). After months of careful\ndeliberation, we arrived at a final version\nof the procedure, most notably with the\nfollowing changes:\n\u2022 The reporting party may also now\nappeal the severity of the sanctions\nimposed.\n\u2022 The option to bring a legal\nrepresentative into hearings is now\navailable to students with disabilities.\n\u2022 College can continue with\ninvestigations even if the Police\nare involved (and will not disclose\ninformation to the Police) unless the\nPolice directly ask the College to pause\nits proceedings.\n\u2022 There will now be communications\nwith all parties involved at regular\nintervals, even if no progress has been\nmade.\n\u2022 Cases can now be reopened in\nexceptional circumstances.\n\u2022 Introduction of developmental\nrequirements (restorative justice) as a\nsanction.\n\u2022 Introduction of mediation (where all\ninvolved parties consent).\n\u2022 The available support to students\ninvolved in the case is now more clearly\nlaid out, with the option of continued\nsupport beyond the outcome of the\ncase.\n\u2022 Fines have been removed as a\nsanction, with the exception of financial\ncompensation for damaged goods or\nproperty with a \u00a3500 limit.\nHayley Wong Union President\nImperial College Union President Hayley Wong.\nCredit: Imperial College Union\ncomment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n24\n\n"

When asked about\nthe best strategy, all they said was \u201cPlay\nit. The best way to learn is just to play\nit.\u201d Of course, there are strategies, but\nthose are best played when joining the\npoker society during their weekly tour-naments.\nThe Tournaments\nEvery week in the Autumn Term,\nthe Poker Society hosts weekly Texas\nHoldem Poker tournaments from 6pm\nto latest 12am in Skempton 301, where\nplayers play in groups of 6-7 players. The\nbuy-in\u2019s are either \u00a35 or \u00a310 per session.\nMembers get a +10% bonus for their\nbuy-in. The membership will cost \u00a35\nnext year, for the entire year. The pot is\nsplit among the winners. So if roughly\n40 players show up, that is a range of\n\u00a3200-\u00a3400 to be\nsplit. First place\ntakes 50%, second place takes 25%, etc. The pot may\nincrease for those who decide to buy in\nagain. Students, alumni, friends, and\nother guests are welcome to join for a\nsession or so. You can expect talks about\nstrategies, social conversation, and discussions about the game.\nCashing Tournaments\nA second tournament is also offered\nat the same place and time. The cash-in\ntournamentallowsplayerstobuyinwith\nas much as they want and leave whenever they want, paying out their wins or\nlosses once they leave. It usually starts\n8pm and players can play for 30 minutes\nbefore leaving. Some players only come\nfor that game. I plan on coming, will I\nsee you there?\nFreshers Tournament\nThe Freshers Tournament is a massive\ntournament at the beginning of the academic year and it hosts normally around\n90 people. Everyone is welcome to at-tend, not just freshers. The buy-in: \u00a35.\nThe pot thereby can be upwards of \u00a3450.\nThe pot splits exactly, as in the weekly\ntournaments.\nFuture Plans for the\nSociety\nFirst,youmustmaintainbefore\ngrowing, hence the society will\nwork hard next year to keep people coming. At the\nbeginning of\nthe first term,\nan average\nof 90 people\nshowed up,\nwhich then breaks\ndown to 30-40 reg-ulars. How will they\ngrow? More socials. More food nights.\nTournaments with the poker societies of\nother universities. They aim to rent out\na conference centre hall for these events,\nexpecting many attendees.\nPrevious Events\nThere have been such events where\ncompanies would sponsor the event\nand the top ten players get a special\nprize. This ranges from interviews with\nthe companies, or to playing the final\nround at their head office. Such companies are scouting talents for risk management and invaluable trading skills in\ntrading companies. Companies such as\n\u2018JumpTrading\u2019 and \u2018GameStreet\u2019 understand that poker is a big culture at their\ncompanies. Skills gained in poker range\nfurther than \u201cplaying the man opposite\nof you\u201d or knowing the basic mathematical probabilities. It is knowing when to\ntake a risk and when not to.\nCharlie Carrel and Game\nTheory Optimal\n\u201cPoker is a solved game. Like chess, it\nhas been solved by computers. There is\nan optimal strategy called GTO (Game\nTheory Optimal). It\u2019s perfect but it\u2019s impossible for any human player to re-cre-ate that. We can try. It is better to exploit\nthe imperfection of the opposition.\u201d said\nDom, to which Thom added \u201cFor exam-ple, we invited Charlie Carrel, a world-class player who has won 9 million dollars playing. He is now retired but still\nplays. He gave a talk last year and we\nspoke face-to-face. He plays exploita-tively. Being a professional player, he understands the GTO style inside and out.\nThe options are infinite.\u201d\nPersonal Enjoyment\nFor Thom and Dom, the Poker Societyisaplacetohangwithfriendsandplay\na game they both enjoy. They play more\nin private than they did before joining.\nDom especially enjoyed \u201cwinning. Making lots of money\u201d. Thom doted on the\n\u201cinfinite number of strategies and the\nflexibility of play.\u201d The \u201ccomplexity of\nthe game\u201d allows players to \u201cbasically\nbet anything you want\u201d.\nWhat would they say to you,\nmy dear reader?\n\u201cWe look forward to meeting you in\nthe fresher's tournament next year. We\nwill have one final leaving tournament\nat the end of term 3. Come and give it a\ngo. There is nothing to lose. You will be\nplaying with 6 or 7 people at a table. Just\ngive it a try.\u201d\nUntil next time,\nCharlotte\nCharlotte Probstel Societies Writer\nGamble your studies, or gamble your money?\nIT\u2019S AN\nIMPOSSIBLE GAME\nTO MASTER, BUT\nEASY TO LEARN\n\u201c A weekly tournament hosted by the Poker Society.\nCredit: Thom\nMeet the Poker Society and the weekly tournaments they host, which are open to both newbies\nand experienced players.\n\n"

Set amidst\nthe dust and sun of Catalonia\u2019s Lleida region, the film\nfollows the expansive Sol\u00e9 family, who have grown and\nsold peaches by hand on the same land for decades. We\nfindourselvesamongstthem,astheyaretoldbytheson\nof the previous landowner that they must make way for\nthe construction of a new solar farm by the end of the\nsummer. The panels will be more profitable for him,\nand the jobs he offers to the men of the family will pay\nbetter than farming the acres of peach trees that have\nstood there for so long. For the three generations of\nSol\u00e9s, it\u2019s not quite as simple as that. There follows a\nchronicling of the tension that this places on the fam-ily, and the whole community \u2013 it\u2019s not just their land\nthat\u2019s being taken \u2013 as the summer, and the harvest season , move quickly towards their end.\nThe members of the ensemble cast bring each character to life beautifully, with a realism that is rarely\nfound outside of smaller, less \u2018mainstream\u2019 films like\nthis one. A realism owed, in this case, to that carefully chosen cast, comprised entirely of non-professional\nactors. The focus of this film is people; those affected\nby the changing technological landscape. We follow\neach individual equally, seeing them in private moments that contextualise their interactions as a family.\nSim\u00f3n\u2019s command of character with minimal dialogue\nis masterfully done. Scenes of Quimet, the father,\nare energetic, stressful, and loud; he characteristically controls the frame in much the same way as he\ntries to control his family. His interactions with the\nland \u2013 itself becoming as much a character as a background \u2013 are efficient, and centred on production; the\nrush to finish the harvest before the fruits turn bad.\nRogelio, the ageing patriarch of the family, presents a\ndifferent portrait of age and a certain helplessness, but\ncontaining enormous reverence for the land and the\nlife it has sustained for him as he walks alone among\nthe trees. The younger children appear to struggle to\nunderstand the situation \u2013 the rural landscape has always been their playground, but it\u2019s clear from the way\nthey find solace in each other that they are well aware\nof the coming changes. Then there are the older teen-agers, secretly growing weed amongst the crops and\nraving in the village and trying to find their own future\naway from the land they grew up in.\nThere\u2019s another character too, slightly more remote\nbut saliently omnipresent. The changes occurring in\nthis rural community are a direct result of climate\nchange, and progress to try and halt it. Droughts and\nfires are a huge risk to farming in dry, warm climates\nlike those of Spain \u2013 but how do our efforts to prevent\nthem affect the livelihoods of the people living and\nworking there? This particularly includes the numerous North African migrant workers who arrive looking for work during the harvesting season \u2013 although\nthe fates of these people are only briefly touched upon\nin the film. Sim\u00f3n\u2019s films (including her similarly-set\nSummer 1993, released in 2017) encapsulate Catalonianculture,exhibitingthelocalfiestasandsenseofcom-munity in the pueblos of rural Spain. Since the 1960s,\nthese areas have been getting smaller as people migrate\nto the cities \u2013 a phenomenon known as Espa\u00f1a vacia-da, or \u2018emptied Spain\u2019 \u2013 with profound effects on the\neconomy and culture of the country. There is a sense of\nnostalgia for these places in Alcarr\u00e0s.\nDespite this, it\u2019s clear that eco-industrialisation isn\u2019t\nnecessarily just the faceless enemy of the film. Jobs are\nprovided - to some extent - for the displaced farmers\n(although, notably, not for the migrant workers) and\nthere is a sense of inevitability that many members of\nthe family accept. But for the most part, the way in\nwhich the progress comes about is tragic. Nowhere is\nthismoreapparentthaninthefilm\u2019spainfullybeautiful\nfinal moments, each shot framing a different member\nof the family as they watch \u2013 and we hear \u2013 the peach\ntrees being torn down by an excavator, one by one.\nFilm Review\nAlcarr\u00e0s is available to watch on Mubi,\nor on Amazon Prime\nwith a subscription\nto the Mubi channel.\nFree trials are\navailable for both!\nWhere can I watch it?\nIllustrations\nby Natalie Yu\n\n"

    "content": "Three years ago, Formula 1 set ambitious targets as part of a wider sustainability strategy to reduce the sport\u2019s\ncarbon footprint. In Formula Student, a\nclub where students build an F1 car, this\nambition has been at the heart of the\nproject for years. Members learn transferable skills such as critical thinking or\nproject management, and gain experience on a hands-on project while driving\nenvironmental change in one of the biggest sport industries in the world.\nFormula Student: a new\napproach to sustainability\nFormula Student is part of Racing\nGreen, an overarching group of car development teams in the Mechanical Engineering Department. It comprises two\nteams of Imperial College London students working in the Pit Garage, located\non campus. Conor Leo, Team Principal,\nclaims: \u201cThe biggest team is Formula\nStudent, which designs and builds the\nfastest car possible to compete in a race\nat the end of the year at Silverstone.\u201d The\nFormula Student competition is essentially Formula 1 at university: what better way to get your feet into the field!\nSince 2010, Imperial has competed in\nthe electrical engine section of Formula\nStudent, as pioneers of environmental\nchange. Conor elaborates, \u201cImperial was\none of the very first. A lot of people are\ncatching up, but the electrical category still has a reputation because of the\nadded difficulty of building the battery.\u201d\nRacing Green members learn how to\ncombine engineering skills with sustainability aims throughout the project.\nRev up your skills by\nbuilding a car\nFrom technically minded mechanical engineers to\nmarketing students, there is a\nplace for everyone in the team:\nwhether designing the car or\nmanaging the business side.\nConor explains that \u201c[they]\nsplit the teams [...] geometrically based, but there are parts of\nthe car which naturally became\na sub team. The chassis [...] is\nquite a large sub team involving\na lot of people, and you can put\na lot of workers with less experience on that\u201d. In an iterative\nprocess, students add parts to\nthe chassis recycled from previous years.\nConor adds: \u201cWe'll test\n[each part] in isolation, test it\nwith another part connected,\nand slowly build it up. That's\nthe easiest way to do it.\u201d With\nlimited funding, every aspect\nof the design must be carefully studied\nthrough simulations and research.\nThe most exciting time of the year\nis towards the end of the second term,\nwhen all the individual parts come to-gether, and the car finally looks like a car\n(and more importantly: moves).\nFormula Student uses an interdisciplinary approach to address sustainability challenges in F1, taking its roots\nin students\u2019 degrees. \u201cThe construction\nof the car was made to correspond with\nthe 3rd year Mechanical Engineering\ncoursework deadlines, with students\nusing the CFD software - discovered in\nclass - for flow simulations.\u201d Alongside\nthem, computer sciences students help\ndevelop MATLAB or Python codes\nfor simulations. From the expertise of\nElectrical and Electronics Engineering\nstudents, Daniel Gutierrez, President\nof Racing Green, tells us that \u201cstudents\nfrom other backgrounds have acquired\na strong knowledge in batteries, which\nremains one of the greatest difficulties in\nthe building of the car. You learn not just\nthe technical skills which you touched\non in the course. You learn those better\nin an applied way and you learn other\ntechnical skills which you would never\nexperience on the course\u201d.\nThe best part: you don\u2019t need to be an\nF1 addict to be part of the team. George\nWorledge, Technical Director, tells us\nabout the soft skills he acquired in the\nteam that will be useful in his consultancycareerplans.\u201cThelongeryouspendin\nit, the more responsibility, the more you\npick up those additional skills. Personal\nmanagement, dealing with delegating to\npeople, taking strategic decisions, and\nthe politics of the department. Overall,\nit\u2019s about learning how to take a more\nstrategic view at the competition, building a plan around it.\u201d\nWhy should you join?\nFormula Student welcomes any student willing to commit. George adds\nthat \u201cthe Mechanical Engineering department is funding most of the project\nin exchange for promotion and commu-nication, and the team goes to schools to\nget pupils interested in engineering and\nthe university.\u201d For non-STEM students\nwilling to be part of the team, the newly\ncreated Business team provides experience in marketing and communication\nas they work to find new sponsors.\nWith some members working within F1 teams such as Williams Racing\nduring their year in industry, the club is\nthe perfect place to launch a career in\nmotorsports. However, Conor declares:\n\u201cA lot of members also got into the manufacturing field after graduating. In fact,\na lot of them are still willing to help us\nout when we need some specific pieces.\u201d\nThe team is now working towards\nreaching self-sufficiency. Daniel says:\n\u201cThe department funds each Racing\nGreen project the same amount but not\nfrom the same pool. I ensure both teams\nare joined so that we can access those\nextra resources and help each other. The\naim is to make the project long-term to\nachieve success over the years.\u201d\nFormula Student is the best way for\nImperial students to develop and apply\ntransferable skills while developing sustainable approaches for one of the most\npopular sports in the world. Now recruiting more and more students from\nevery background, the team hopes that\nby becoming self-sufficient and achieving success in their races, they can drive\nchange in the F1 industry. As members\nbuild lifelong relationships and skills,\nFormula Student welcomes motivated\nstudents to help them take their success\na step further.\nYou can contact the team at: icrac-ing@ic.ac.uk, @imperialracinggreen on\nInstagram or visit https://www.imperi-al.ac.uk/racing-green/ to find out more.\nFRIDAY 5TH MAY 2023\n31\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nSPORT & SOCIETIES Edited by: Isabella Ward\nCharlotte Probstel\nSport&Societies\nFormula Student: the motorsports\nteam leading the charge for change\nClaire Bonnisseau Guest Writer\nAs they count down to Silverstone, Formula Student gear up to meet green challenges.\nA student member of Racing Green in the pit garage.\nCredit: Thomas Angus\n\n"

However, as action\nin both disputes included a marking\nand assessment boycott, and concerns\naround pay & working conditions\nremain unresolved, this will make no\ndifference to the action taken.\nThe boycott commences just over\ntwo weeks after the UCU renewed its\nmandate for strike action for another\nsix months, when a reballot of UCU\nmembers found 85.65% in favour of\nstrike action and 89.92% in favour of\naction short of strike action, with a\nturnout of 56.41%.\nThe reballot gives the UCU a six\nmonth mandate for strike action and\naction short of striking, and the union\nhas said that such action will continue\nuntil an agreement is reached with\nthe university employers, or until the\nmandate runs out.\nStrike action has been taking place at\nsome UK universities since 2021.\nThedisputeoverpensionsbeganwhen\narevaluationoftheUSSpensionscheme\nfound that it was set to be in a deficit\nof \u00a314.1bn. This led fund managers\nto levy increased contributions onto\nworkers in return for a 35% reduction\nin guaranteed retirement income for its\naverage member, stating that the fund\nwas unsustainable if such action was not\ntaken.\nThe revaluation was conducted\nnear the beginning of the COVID-19\npandemic. The UCU has said that the\nrevaluation was \u201cflawed\u201d because \u201cglobal\nmarkets were crashing\u201d at the time,\nleading to an erroneous final assessment.\nThe total impact of the strike action\nis currently unclear, though renewed\naction may lead to problems with\ngraduation for final year students whose\nwork may not be marked in time.

    "content": "\u201cWith most people, suicide is like Russian roulette.\nOnly one chamber has a bullet. With the Lisbon girls,\nthe gun was loaded. A bullet for family abuse. A bullet\nfor genetic predisposition. A bullet for historical ma-laise. A bullet for inevitable momentum. The two other\nbullets are impossible to name, but that doesn\u2019t mean\nthe chambers were empty.\u201d\nThe Virgin Suicides by Jeffrey Eugenides is a trag-ic-but-beautiful tale, filled to the brim with\nrich prose and a hazy American-Dream-gone-terribly-wrong aesthetic. The novel tells the fictional story\nof the Lisbon girls; five sisters whom, over the course\nof one year, all commit suicide in their suburban Michigan home. It is told from the perspective of a group of\nboys who were hopelessly infatuated with the girls at\nthe time of the incidents, and now, decades later, are\nstill trying to understand why a whole family eliminated themselves in such a shocking, disturbing way.\nThe book is littered with contradictory facts, unreliable interviews, and the warped, slightly inaccurate\nmemories that surface when grown adults try to recall\ntheir teenage years. These inconsistencies make for a\nsurreal read, with the events in question coming across\nas highly ambiguous. The reasoning behind the Lisbon\ngirls\u2019 actions is left vague, making characterising them\nnear impossible. And many, many reviews either praise\nor criticise the lack of a definitive conclusion explaining the suicides.\nHowever, reading this in 2023, I find the confusion\nover why the girls did what they did a little ludicrous.\nPersonally, even though it was never clearly explained,\ntheir actions seem obvious to me in a way they might\nnot have been in 1993 when the book was published.\nAnd I imagine most readers now could better understand and empathise with the experiences of these five\nmiddle-class suburban girls and why they acted upon\ntheir suicidal thoughts. Because every single one of us\nhas now experienced what it feels like to be trapped inside our own homes.\nWithout spoiling too much, a large portion of the\nbook focuses on the Lisbon girls essentially being\ntrapped within their house for months on end. Their\nparents are strict, unwilling to allow the girls a single\nounce of freedom. They are especially restrictive with\nanything involving the transition from girl to woman-hood; make-up, romance, magazines, music, and social\nevents are heavily limited. Their clothing is controlled\nand censored, and so for a lot of the story the boys tend\nto blend the sisters together into a single entity of long\ndresses and old fashioned up-dos. They are unstimulat-ed, with little to do in a house which is no longer being\ntakencareof,leadingtodecreasinghygiene,health,and\nquality of life. It gets to the point when they stop attending school, and all they have is that one building\nwith seven people constantly occupying it. As the novel\nprogresses, we learn that the home was observed obsessively by the boys, who witness it slowly rotting from\nthe inside out.\nWhile reading this, I could not help but think that\nif I too lived under these circumstances, with no books,\nelectronics,friends,oridentityofanykind,Iwouldalso\nstart losing the will to exist. Their depression is obvious\nto me now in a way it would not have been pre-lock-down, because lockdown showed us all that boredom\ncan cause pain, a lack of purpose can catalyse depres-sion, and having nothing meaningful to do for months\non end can result in a serious risk of suicidal thoughts.\nBecause of this shared experience, I urge people to\nreadthisbooknow,asIbelieveittrulycaptureshowwe\nall felt during the long lockdown periods. I believe people can get something more out of the work now than\npre-2020. The Virgin Suicides beautifully highlights exactly how boredom can become a silent killer.\nEdited by: Zanna Buckland\nBooks\nbooks.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\n26\nReading The Virgin Suicides in a\nPost-Pandemic World\nBooks Article\nNatasha Ali Books Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nBOOKS\nBooks writer Natasha Ali introspectively examines the parallels between Jeffrey\nEugenides\u2019 1993 coming-of-age novel and our experiences in lockdown.\nStill from Sofia Coppola\u2019s 1999 film adaptation of the novel.\n\n"

    "content": "FRIDAY 5TH MAY 2023\nSCIENCE\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk 11\nPint of Science is an annual science\nfestival where members of the public gather at local pubs, caf\u00e9s, and other\nspaces to listen to scientists talk about\ntheir research, engage in discussion with\nresearchers, and play science-themed\ngames. The official festival will be held in\nlate May, with talks all over the UK and\ntherestoftheworld.Duringtheholiday,\nTaylorandIattendPintofScience\u2019staster event to get a sneak peek at what the\nupcoming festival will be like.\nTheeventisheldinaverycasualsettin;\nwith the exception of a projection screen\nand table of games at the front, the pub\nlooks the same as it usually would. Attendees gather in groups around tables,\nsipping drinks and noshing on onion\nrings as scientists talk. Taylor points this\nout as something he especially appreci-ates: here, science becomes open, losing\nthe air of professionalism and stuffiness\nwhich fills labs and lecture halls.\nThree talks are presented during the\nevening: one on how research into parasitic infections can give information\nthat can help deter childhood stunting,\nanother on the engineering and logistics\nof designing low-cost prosthetics, and\nthe third on how examining the eye\u2019s\nblood vessels can shed unexpected light\non general health conditions. Although\nthe same talks won\u2019t be held during the\nactual festival, one can expect similarly\nthought-provoking talks covering a variety of scientific fields, relating to relevant topics and issues. Each talk is followed by a friendly Q&A session where\nattendees have a chance to learn more\nabout scientists\u2019 research.\nBetween talks, there are breaks for attendees to converse with one another, as\nwellastograbsomedrinksandpubgrub.\nUnfortunately, food and drink aren\u2019t included in the ticket price, so you\u2019ll have\nto pay extra if you do want a pint to go\nwith your science (here\u2019s hoping that the\npub you choose is cheap!)\nThere\u2019s also a game running during\nthe breaks, which allows attendees to try\ntheir hand at pipetting - after a short\ntutorial on how to use a pipette, attendees compete to fill a row of wells in the\nshortest time possible. Taylor and I have\na go, and although we don\u2019t take home\nthe winning prize (a Pint of Science pint\nglass), we still have a good time. They\nmanage to make pipetting fun - something which, after many agonising sessions at the biochemistry lab, I didn\u2019t\nthink was possible.\nOne downside of the event is that\nsomeofitcanfeelrathertechnical:some\nof the talks mention advanced concepts\nand feature busy, complicated-looking\ndiagrams in their visuals. If you don\u2019t\nhave a lot of background knowledge\non the particular field being presented,\nthere are times where it\u2019s hard to keep\nup. This isn\u2019t common between all talks,\nthough, and the messages are still largely quite accessible. Overall, Taylor and I\nlearn a lot\u2014and we enjoy much of the\nevent as well.\nPint of Science will be held during the\nevenings of May 22-24 in 30 pubs across\nLondon. Tickets cost \u00a35 each.

Because I just can\u2019t take it any\nmore,\u201d he said.\nSeveral other members of the Security\nteam feel they have been \u201csingled out\u201d\nas part of management\u2019s attempt to\n\u201cdivide and conquer\u201d. An officer notes\nthat, since he was involved in union\nmeetings of 2015, he feels he has been\n\u201cdiscriminated against compared to\nother staff\u201d. \u201cI would never recommend\nanyone working for Imperial College;\u201d\nanother said, \u201cit\u2019s a bullying culture.\u201d\nOfficersalsofeelthattheirsupervisors\neither send staff to new locations, add\nnew duties, or cut overtime shifts as\nbullying tactics. The above officer\u2019s shift\nrepresentative was moved from Silwood\nPark to a London Campus. He resigned\nshortly after, \u201cunder duress (from\nmanagement and his supervisors)\u201d, the\nofficer suspects.\nTheSecurityofficers\u2019situationismade\nall the more desperate by the behaviour\nof HR, who they feel are \u201cin cahoots\u201d\nwith management. One officer said that\nin situations where he and his colleagues\nhad hoped HR would mediate between\nSecurity officers and management \u201cthey\ninstead seemed spiteful!\u201d\nAllegedly, a member of Security\nstaff was asked to leave shortly after\noverhearing the then-head of security\nboasting about a pay bonus he had\nreceived from the College due to his\nsuccess in drastically reducing spending\non Security. He did not appeal because\nhe felt that collusion between Security\nmanagement and HR would make it a\nfutile attempt.\nJustlastweek,anofficerfromSilwood\nPark explained to HR his grievances\nwith management, and why he was\nspeaking to Felix. The following day,\nthis officer had an overtime shift he had\nsigned up for cut; he says this is only the\nsecond time he has had overtime pulled\nin13years.Hesuspectsthisisretaliation\nfor what he said about management and\nfor speaking with Felix. Indeed, HR\ninformed management some time ago of\nSecurity\u2019s action to talk to Felix, in what\nthe officer calls a \u201cbetrayal of employee\nrelations\u201d.\n\u201cHR and Security management are\njust looking after each other\u201d, the officer\nsays, \u201cand if you can\u2019t go to HR, where\ncan you go?\u201d\nImperial College London responded:\n\u201cEveryone deserves to feel safe at\nImperial. Bullying and harassment is\nunacceptable and must not be tolerated\nanywhere within our community. As\nwellasourexistingHarassment,Bullying\nand Victimisation Policy, we recently\ndeveloped a suite of core College Values\nand Behaviours to embed a positive and\ninclusive culture at all levels. We have a\nteam of Harassment Support Contacts\nwho can provide confidential support\nto staff who feeling bullied, harassed,\nor intimidated at work, and our Report\nand Support Tool allows staff to disclose\nunwelcoming behaviours - including\nbullying.\u201d\nFeeling they had been \u201cbetrayed\u201d by\nboth HR and Unison, who were \u201cas\nbad as our bosses\u201d, the eight Security\nofficers at Silwood Park submitted a\ngrievance against Imperial College\nmanagementandHRinNovember2021.\nIn it, they complained chiefly about the\nlack of initial consultation in changes\nto annual leave and the subsequent\nreluctance to address this. They also\nrequested that their annual leave was\nrectified, and that HR and management\nconcededthattherehadwrongfullybeen\nno consultation and resolved for this to\nnot happen again in the future. \t\t\nHowever \u201cthe changes made to our\nannual leave were not the sole reason\nthat we felt that it was time to make a\nstand, it was more that it was the final\nstraw;\u201d an officer said. \u201cAfter years of\nwatching our contracts being eroded, we\nfelt there was nothing left to take from\nus and that we now had nothing to lose\u201d.\nWithin a week of submitting the\ngrievance, an extra, unexplained full\npatrol of the campus was added to\ntheir shift duties. Security officers\nbelieve this to be a direct consequence\nof having initiated the grievance. The\npatrol was to commence on the 1st\nDecember 2021: the same day that\nsecurity had their grievance meeting\nwith an independent investigator.\nAs part of the investigation, on 14th\nJanuary 2022, two Security managers\nwere interviewed and assumedly asked\nabout this extra patrol. Three days later,\na document detailing shift procedures,\nincluding the extra patrol, was emailed\nto Security staff. The document was\nbackdatedto1stApril2021\u2013afewweeks\nbefore Security were told of changes to\ntheir annual leave \u2013 but Security staff\nclaim to have never seen it before. Two\nmonths later the document appeared\nin the Silwood Park Security office;\na supervisor was caught on CCTV\ncarrying the \u201cfraudulent\u201d document\ninto the office, on top of a microwave.\n\u201cWhatever we tell them, they said\n\u201chowcanwecoverthisupandmakeitgo\naway?\u201d. They are not worried about any\naccountability whatsoever or admitting\nto anything\u201d an officer despaired.\nNevertheless,theofficerswererelieved\nthat in March 2022 the independent\ninvestigator ruled upholding all the\ncomplaints made in the Grievance and\nrecommending that either the error in\nannual leave entitlement be rectified\nor that a consultation be launched.\nIn May 2022, a consultation was\nheld with Silwood Park Security over\nTeams, which resulted in what / calls\n\u201ca disgraceful attempt by management\nand a senior member of HR to try and\njustify the amount of annual leave that\nthey had told us we would be receiving.\u201d\n\u201cHR made us feel that we were liars and\nwe were thick,\u201d an officer says. Therefore,\nSecurity officers wrote to the head of\nHR, requesting that the member be\nremoved from the consultation due\nto a clear lack of objectivity. This was\nrefused but she was not involved again.\n\u201cIt felt like more of a charade,\u201d says an\nofficer,pointingoutthattheconsultation\nwas only for Silwood Park employees\nand not South Kensington employees,\ndespite their Terms and Conditions\nhaving been wrongfully changed as well.\nManagement and HR stated that they\nhad already implemented the changes\nfor South Kensington staff, with whom\nthey had no intention of consulting\nas they had \u201caccepted\u201d the changes.\nThe consultation process concluded\nwith a correction of Security officers\u2019\nbasic hours, but lacked any apology\nfor the mistakes or the attempts to try\nand force officers into accepting them.\nOfficers were also told they would not\nbe getting neither the 26 hours back in\nleave nor overtime payment, and would\nnot be receiving any compensation for\nthe extra hours that had been missed off\ntheir allocation for over a decade.\nOne year on from the ruling, little\nhas changed, and Security officers are\napparently no closer to obtaining an\napology from the College: \u201cThere is no\nintenttolookintothewayHRbehaved;\u201d\nan officer says, \u201cwere we to behave in\nsuchapoorandquestionablemanner,we\nhave no doubts that we would have been\nshown the door. The different standard\nof acceptable behaviour between levels is\nstaggering.\u201d\nIn fact, despite their satisfaction with\nthe ruling, the Silwood Park team feel\nutterly failed by the grievance process:\n\u201cOneofthemanydisappointingaspects\nof the grievance process experience was\nthat the recommendations made in [the\ngrievance] report were handed straight\nback to the people that the grievance\nwas directed at, namely [HR] and\nsecurity management. Having witnessed\ntheir attempts to cover up their other\nindiscretions, the lack of changes made\nwas sadly predictable.\u201d\nThey voiced their frustrations in\nan email to Professor Ian Walmsley,\nhighlighting the ineffectuality of the\ngrievance process. The email was simply\nforwarded to both the HR department\nand head of Security, both of whom\nWE NOW HAD\nNOTHING TO\nLOSE\n\n"

My attitude\nchangedwhenIarrivedintheUK.Allof\na sudden, I stopped pining for rain and\nbegan to look forward to warmth and\nsunshine. Rainy days aren\u2019t particularly\nunbearable for me, though. It\u2019s the other\ninhabitants of Britain\u2019s wilderness that\nhate them.\nHerptiles (reptiles and amphibians)\nand bugs mostly lie dormant\nthroughout the winter \u2013 especially on\nthe particularly cold days. It\u2019s not a good\nidea to disturb sleeping herptiles, but\nsome bugs are fairly active during winter\n\u2013 just not out in the open. Lifting and\nglancing underneath debris, such as logs\nand rocks, often reveals a whole host of\nwildlife scuttling for cover. I persevered\neven during the cold months, and was\noccasionally rewarded for my efforts\nwithsomecentipedesandmoneyspiders.\nFor the most part, all I was able to find\nwere the omnipresent and cold-resistant\nwoodlice, slugs, and earthworms.\nHowever, on a pleasant March\nmorning of log-flipping in Hyde Park, I\nnoticed some movement on the ground.\nA little black speck sprinted across the\nmud and into some leaves. I didn\u2019t think\nmuch of it, and continued on my way.\nThen, another. And another. I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve my luck \u2014 these were tiny wolf\nspiders (Pardosa sp.) enjoying the sun\nwhile it lasted. I hastily brought out my\nphone \u2013 clip-on macro lens attached \u2013\nand scanned the surrounding leaf litter.\nEvery few seconds, one of them would\nshow up, stop for a moment, and dart\nwith unbelievable speed into the foliage.\nIendeavouredtimeandtimeagaintoget\none of them to stay still just for a second,\nbut they disappeared the moment their\neyes saw motion. Wolf spiders have very\nwell-developed vision because of their\ndiurnal, active-hunting habits. While\nthis clearly worked in their favour, it\nhardly worked in mine.\nI was absolutely spellbound as I\nwatched these little black gems weave\ntheir way in and out of the leaves, almost\nas if part of some ethereal dance. Every\nnow and then, a particularly large spider\nwould show up \u2014 what I thought was\nthe slightly more bulky spotted wolf\nspider (Pardosa amentata) but, much\nto my delight, was actually a fox spider\n(Alopecosa pulverulenta). Despite\ndwarfing their little black companions,\nfox spiders are equally as fast. I gave up\non getting close-up shots, and had more\nsuccess taking videos while inching\ncloser to them.\nAlso in the mix were some nursery\nweb spiders (Pisaura mirabilis), famous\nfor their characteristic X-pose. They\nare also, unfortunately, just as quick as\nthe wolf spiders. When I managed to\nsuccessfully catch one in a jar, and tip\nit onto my hand in the hopes that it\nwould calm down, it swiftly dived to the\nbottom of my finger and leapt into the\nleaf litter.\nAmong the tireless sprinters, I also\nmanaged to find a juvenile ground\ncrab spider (Xysticus cristatus) sunning\nitself on a leaf. I felt as though I had\nhappened upon something rare, but\nwas pleasantly proven wrong when I\nwitnessed the same spectacle half an\nhour later on a different leaf pile. This\nwas not an isolated incident, but a sign\nof sunny days to come.\nWhenreadingabout Pardosa,Iwould\noften read lines such as \u201cactively run on\nthe ground during warm sunny days\u201d. As\na habitual log-flipper, I ignored these \u2014\nI have spotted a singular common wolf\nspider (Pardosa pullata) under a log on a\ncold, damp day, so I assumed they were\njust tough to find. In a way, turning\nover pieces of cover is taking the easy\nway out because it takes advantage of\nspiders\u2019 universal need to be hidden. By\nobserving them frolicking on the leaves,\nthe joy felt more shared. It appeared\nthat these dainty little creatures only\nhid temporarily \u2013 after scrambling\nfor cover, they would adorn the fallen\nleaves moments later.\nIn a city notorious for its unpleasant\nweather, that one sunny day in Hyde\nPark was an oasis of sorts \u2013 for both me\nand the spiders.

We don\u2019t really know the\nimportance of the plastic particle type\nor shape, for example,\u201d Dr Wright says.\nWhat can we do about it?\n\u201cI suggest we rethink our relationships\nwith new plastics and to reuse what\nwe already have\u201d, Dr Wright says. \u201cTo\nreduce microplastic release, we need to\nthink about avoiding plastic materials in\nour daily life\u201d.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick your battles,\nthough.

We\nshould point out that management/HR usually slaps a\n\u2018confidentially\u2019 clause on these proceedings, which is\ngreatly frustrating as all the time and effort that is spent\nis not visible to our membership.\nFrom the point of the trades-unions we must be clear\nthat there has and is a strong tendency for management\nto report that the \u2018Unions\u2019 are \u2018in agreement\u2019 and\ngenerate statements to that effect when no such thing\nhas happened!\nThetrades-unionsdoNOThaveanypowerofveto.We\ncannot stop management and HR from putting through\npolicy, procedures, and any other documents such as\nthe security standing orders. We DO NOT \u2018agree\u2019 to\nany of these things, even for those that we get sight of,\nand even on occasion effect some changes above and\nbeyond comments on grammar and pronoun usage.\nUnite, as well as the other trades-unions, have argued\nagainst the compulsory signing requirement of the\nsecurity standing orders. We support the assentation\nthat they can be seen as changes to the employment\ncontract, and this is very disturbing. We note that the\nmain body of staff at Imperial are not required to\nsign such documents, so believe this practise is highly\ndiscriminatory.\nThe issues around security staff are significant and\ntheir annual leave equivalent is atrocious. By using\nan hours-equivalent shift-based model they are in\nour opinion being very poorly treated by Imperial\nmanagement (I am being polite here), who seem intent\non cost optimisations rather than best-practise service\nprovision to our community.\nIt is my personal opinion, which I have expressed\nmany times in meetings with HR and security, that our\nsecurity staff are the most important group of people at\nImperial. Their job is to keep us safe on campus whilst\nthe rest of us go about our studies and other activities.\nPlus, they are first responders in any incident or medical\nemergency,whichweknowfromourFirst-Aidtrainingis\nespecially critical if someone needs an AED defibrillator.\nIf we are NOT safe on campus, then everything else\nis moot. We need more security staff, working proper\nhours, with sufficient numbers that they have resilience\nin their provision and attendance.

A\nSilwood Park officer told Felix \u201cI believe\nbullying and intimidation has been rife\nwithin our department for a long time\nand has been used to keep us in line and\nto stop us questioning management\u2019s\ndecisions.\u201d\nHe told Felix how he was bullied by\na member of management for years who\nwould call him \u201cknob jockey\u201d behind\nhis back, supposedly in an attempt to\n\u201calienatepeople\u201d,andhowhiscomplaints\nwere always dismissed.

It is ana-lysed, processed, and run\nthrough databases until a\nmatch is found. Usually, a\nconviction would be all but\ncertain from this point on,\nbut this particular crime\nhas one unfortunate catch.\nThe suspect in question\nhas an identical twin, genetically indistinguisha-ble. Suddenly, a conviction\ncannot be made. The case\nremains in limbo. And the\nsuspect is protected by the\nsimplefactthattheybelong\nto the 0.3% of people whose fertilised\negg separated early in development to\ncreate two embryos.\nMonozygotic twins have presented a\ncurious challenge for forensic scientists\nover the years. They are the sole exception to DNA being unique to an indi-vidual, and the standard tests used for\nhuman identification are useless against\nthem. Paternity, rape, and even murder\ninvestigations have been stalled or left\nunresolved because of this rare biological phenomenon. That is, until 2014,\nwhentheinternationallifesciencescom-pany Eurofins developed an ultra-deep\nsequencing method that could root out\na miniscule number of nucleotide differ-encesbetweenidenticaltwins.Thesedis-parities were small, seemingly insignificant mutations that probably occurred\nearly in development after fertilised egg\nseparation.\nWhile this discovery was pivotal, it\nwas also limited. Ultra-deep sequencing\nrequires the entire genome of both twins\nto be processed many times for accurate\nresults. This makes it both expensive and\ntime-consuming to perform. The paper\npresenting the discovery was fittingly\ntitled \u2018Finding the Needle in the Haystack\u2019 - it is simply an inefficient method that can and should be improved\nupon. While there have been efforts to\nlook for other variations between twins,\nsuch as differences in RNA expression\nand epigenetics (environmental DNA\nmodifications affecting gene expression\nwithout changing the DNA sequence),\nthese come with their own restrictions.\nRNA can be unstable and easily degra-dable, and epigenetic modifications like\nmethylation are vulnerable to environmental factors that can affect results. All\nthis is to say, those with an identical twin\nare still in a much better position to \u2018get\naway with murder\u2019 than the rest of us.\nHowever, in March 2023, a new paper\npublished in Forensic Science International offered a solution to this predic-ament, utilising a collection of genes already being used in precision medicine:\nthe immune repertoire.\nThe immune repertoire is a feature\nof the adaptive immune system, a process that allows the immune system to\nform \u2018memories\u2019 through retaining an-tigen-binding receptors from previous\npathogen encounters. These receptors\nare coded for by a subset of genes that\nrecombine with each other to create\nunique sets of antigen-binding recep-tors. The immune repertoire is simply\nthe term used to describe this collection\nof genetic rearrangements in a person\u2019s\nadaptive immune system at any given\ntime, and it can be modified by the pathogens and foreign bodies a person is exposed to throughout their lifetime.\nWhile twins may grow up in similar\nenvironments, it is highly unlikely they\nwill be exposed to the exact same pathogens at the exact same time, especially\nin grown adult twins who presumably\nmove to separate homes. Because of\nthis, their immune repertoires will be\nsolely their own. And by extracting peripheral blood and sequencing various\nadaptive immune system-related genes,\nscientists have now been able to detect\nsubstantial differences between monozygotic twins\u2019 T-cell receptor genes.\nIn all the twin pairs test-ed, a difference of 34 base\npairs in nucleic acid length\ndistribution frequency was\nfound. While other genes\nshowed little to no difference between twins, this\ncould be because only four\npairs of twins were tested,\nall of Han Chinese ethnic-ity. Scientists hope that by\ncollecting more samples\nand exploring other ethnic\ngroups, they will be able to\nuncover more differences between monozygotic\ntwins that can be easily de-tected.\nIf this method proves\nto be successful and repro-ducible, it will be cheaper\nand more efficient to implement than\nits ultra-deep sequencing counterpart,\nsince only the adaptive immune system\ngenes will need to be studied instead of\nthe whole genome. It will also be more\nreliable than its RNA and epigenetic counterparts, as immune repertoire\ngenes have been verified to remain stable\nfor at least three years.\nEvil twins committing crimes and\nframing their doppelg\u00e4ngers is an old\ntrope that has been explored repeatedly\nin art and media. Hopefully, with these\nnew findings, we can prevent it from becoming reality.\nSCIENCE\nScan here to read the original\narticle from Forensic Science International:\nCredit: Natasha Ali\nThe peculiar case of identical twins\nin forensic genetics\nNatasha Ali Science Writer\nIdentical twins have always posed a challenge in forensics.

At the time, an affiliate\ncompany of Diligence Security,\nDiligence Technical Solutions Ltd,\nwas partly owned by a senior member\nof the Security team\u2019s spouse. The two\ncompanies have shared two of the\nsame directors: Dr Michael Patrick\nBateman and Mr Adam William Frame.\nIn 2018, Diligence Security filed for\ninsolvency and subsequently agreed\nto Company Voluntary Arrangements\n(CVA), allowing them to continue\ntrading as long as they made monthly\npayments of \u00a33000 to creditors for\nfive years. That same year, Imperial\nCollege allegedly signed a three-year\ncontract with Diligence Security.\nThe concerned spouse resigned\nfrom Diligence Technical that July\nand was replaced by Frame. However,\nthe company was struck off a year\nlater due to failing to file accounts.\nFrame later became Director of\nDiligence Security in August 2020.\nThe supervisor for Diligence\nSecurity\u2019s CVA notes that, whilst\ndisplaying resilience during the\npandemic, Diligence Security struggled\nto retain existing work and win or renew\ncontracts due to being under CVA.\nIndeed, in May 2020 the company\npaid a total dividend of \u00a328,321.90 to\ncreditors. Yet little over a year later, in\nJuly2021,theypaid\u00a3134,021.32:nearly\nfive times as much. The supervisor also\nnotes that Imperial College London\nprovided its largest existing contract.\nIn June 2021 Diligence Security\nchangedtheconditionsoftheirCVAand\nterminateditwithafinalone-offpayment\nof \u00a399,000, so they would succeed in re-tenderingtheImperialcontract.Imperial\nhave allegedly sinced extended their\ncontract with Diligence to five years.\nImperial College London told Felix\nthat the procurement of this supplier\nwas in line with College Procurement\nRegulations and went through the\nappropriate competitive tender and\ncontract award processes at Imperial.\nA conflict of interest amongst\nSecurity management is apprently not\nunprecedented: allegedly, the directors\nof previously contracted training\ncompanies Andy McCormack and\nBlue Mountain were friends with a\nsenior member of Security staff. \u201cIt\u2019s\nnot right,\u201d says an officer, \u201cand that\nmanagement are aware makes me\nthink that they are just ignoring it.\u201d\nThe number of Diligence Security\nstaff used has been increasing: one night\nrecently only 15 out of 31 of the Security officers on duty were in-house staff.\nSome areas are now exclusively manned\nby Diligence, including St Mary\u2019s Hospital, the Heart and Lung Institute, and\nBeit Quad. In-house staff were initially\ntold that sub-contracting was introduced as a cost-saving measure to reduce operating costs, which at the time\nwere \u00a3500,000 over budget. However,\nsince in-house security are no longer\npaid heightened rates for overtime, the\nCollege is likely saving little money by\nfielding Dilligence personnel instead of\nSecurity staff.\nFurthermore, in-house security staff\nareconcernedthatthelackofexperience\nand knowledge of the area Diligence\nSecurity staff have is \u201cputting staff and\nstudents at risk\u201d. Diligence has allegedly\nalready been banned from manning the\nBurlington Daines Medical Research\nFacility after failing to respond to a fire\nalarm.\nHence, despite increased dependence\non Diligence Security, key responsibilities such as dealing with fire alarms are\nleft to Imperial staff. A member of security at White City, where they work\nshifts in pairs, tells Felix \u201cYou\u2019re basically\non your own\u201d.\nIn June 2021, a warden phoned the\npolice after finding a large number of\nintruders in Xenia Hall shortly after\nmidnight due to the door of the building apparently having been left open.\nDespite the noise being made, Security\nhad marked in the log book \u2018nothing to\nreport\u2019 at that time. Whilst the log book\ndeclared that they had been present at\nthe time of this instance, there was no\nsight of them. When the log book was\nchecked by the warden around 1am, it\nhad also already been signed for a security patrol set to occur at 4am, again\nclaiming \u2018nothing to report\u2019.\nWhilst the Diligence employee responsible has been dismissed, in-house\nstaff are concerned about the calibre of\npersonnel working alongside them, as an\nofficer claims \u201c[management] don\u2019t care\naboutthequalityofsecurityofficersthey\nbring into this university. They don\u2019t\ncare about staff and student security.\u201d\nAn officer from White City explains:\n\u201c[Diligence] standard is not the same as\nours, but to our management it counts\nas the numbers.

The JUICE spacecraft\nwas launched by the Ariane 5 ECA rock-et, the same rocket model that launched\nthe James Webb Space Telescope on\nChristmas Day, 2021.\nA magnetometer designed by Imperial physicists, known as J-MAG, has the\nhonour of being one of the instruments\nonboard the JUICE mission to study\nJupiter\u2019s moons. J-MAG will study the\nmoon Ganymede, exploring the liquid\noceans beneath its icy surfaces and shedding new light on Ganymede\u2019s potential\nas a habitable environment.\nThe J-MAG project was led by Principal Investigator Michelle Dougherty,\nHead of Department of Physics at Imperial. The magnetometer was created\nto study the magnetic fields of Ganymede, some of which are in its oceans.\nThe oceans on Ganymede are thought\nto be salty, and movement in the charges\nof this salt gives rise to currents, which\nin turn lead to generation\nof small magnetic fields in\naccordance with the Ampere-Maxwell Law. However, these fields are also embedded within the larger,\nintrinsic magnetic fields of\nGanymede, Jupiter, and the\nSun.\nJ-MAGwillthusstudythe\ninteraction of Ganymede\u2019s\nand Jupiter\u2019s magnetic fields\nin order to detangle them\nfrom the smaller fields of\nthe oceans, and understand\ntheir depth and extent.\nThis can then help inform whether Jupiter might have the conditions to support\nlife.\nJ-MAG has been designed to be incredibly precise, thanks to the work of\nthe Department of Physics\u2019 J-MAG instrumentation team, led by instrument\nmanager Patrick Brown. This level of\nprecision is especially important considering the complex environment of\nGanymede\u2019s magnetic fields. Designing\nthis instrument was tricky: building\nthe instrument during the COVID-19\npandemic whilst still meeting ESA\u2019s project deadlines must\u2019ve been a particular\nheadache! During the height of the pan-demic, in 2020, the Imperial team actually took home parts of magnetometer\nto tweak on their kitchen tables, emphasising further the feat of the design and\nengineering of J-MAG.\nIn an interview with the Evening\nStandard, Professor Dougherty said:\n\u201cYou need a lot of patience to be in-volvedinouter-planetaryspacecraftmis-sions. I\u2019m going to be 68 when JUICE\ngets to Jupiter. It\u2019s young people who are\ngoing to be working on the data that gets\nsent back.\u201d\nThis mission serves as an excellent reminder for undergraduates\nacross all disciplines of some\nof the exciting research they\ncould potentially pursue in\nthe future. The UK Space\nAgency invested around \u00a39\nmillion in the mission to explore Jupiter and its moons.\nThe UK\u2019s space sector is\ncontinuing to thrive and is\ncommitted to pushing the\nboundaries of science, inno-vation, and technology that\nwill support a vast array of\njobs for the future.\nMore on the JUICE spacecraft\nInspired by NASA\u2019s Cassini-Huygens\nmission probing the study of Saturn\u2019s\nmoons and manufactured by Airbus\nDefence and Space, JUICE will study\nthree of Jupiter\u2019s Galilean moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. The moons\nare thought to contain bodies of liquid\nwater beneath their icy surfaces, making them potentially habitable environ-ments.\nOnboard the JUICE spacecraft are 11\nscientific instruments, carefully selected following a competition by the ESA.\nThese instruments are compartmental-ised into four types: remote-sensing,\ngeophysical, experimental, and in-situ\ninstruments. The latter is a unique class\nof instrumentation: the term itself refers\nto an instrument that makes measurements of a particle and field environment that a satellite is embedded in.\nIn-situ instrumentation is crucial to the\nspace sciences. Although remote, ex-situ\nobservations can provide lots of essential\ninformation for planetary exploration,\nin-situ instruments can provide more\ndetail for a unique, up-close inspection\nof the compelling features of the Jovian\nsystem.\nImperial's J-MAG magnetometer is\namong only three in-situ instruments\nonboard the spacecraft. The scalar mag-netometer has a nominal measurement\nrange of 0-50,000nT, with a precision of\n3pT. This level of precision is especially important considering the complex\nenvironment of Ganymede's magnetic fields. The smaller ocean-generated\nfields - which are predicted to be nearly\ntwo million times smaller than Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field (~50\u00b5T) - are embedded in larger fields from the interior of\nGanymede, from its primary, Jupiter,\nand from the Sun itself. All these fields\nneed to be untangled, which is where\nJ-MAG comes in.\nThe main scientific objectives for Ganymede, and to a lesser extent for Europa and Callisto, are: characterisation\nof ocean layers and detection of putative\nsubsurface water reservoirs, topographi-cal, geological and compositional mapping of the surface, study of the physical\nproperties of the icy crusts, characteri-sation of internal mass distribution dynamics and evolution of the interiors,\ninvestigation of Ganymede\u2019s tenuous at-mosphere, and lastly (and arguably most\nimportantly!) study of Ganymede\u2019s in-trinsicmagneticfieldanditsinteractions\nwith the Jovian atmosphere.\nGanymede's ocean-generated field is\nunlike any other moon or rocky planet\nin the Solar System, besides Earth, making it a prime target for the ESA. JUICE\nwill arrive at the Jovian system in July\n2031. It will first perform a flyby of Ganymede In preparation Jupiter orbital in-sertionabout7.5hourslater.JUICEwill\nthen fly by Europa and Callisto in July\n2032, orbit Ganymede in 2034, and formally conclude its mission by impacting\nGanymede at the end of 2035.\nOrbiting Ganymede will form the\ncore of the study for the JUICE orbiter;\nwith its complementary investigations\nof Europa and Callisto forming a com-plete, comparative picture of these Galilean moons.\nTaylor Pomfret Science Editor\nScience\nImperial makes instrumental\ncontribution to Jupiter mission\nThe JUICE spacecraft concept, illustrated\nwith a backdrop of Jupiter and two of its\nmoons\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nA magnometer created by Imperial physicists is now on board the historic JUICE spacecraft on\na mission to study Jupiter\u2019s moons.\nThe launch of Ariane 5,\nthe rocket carrying the\nJUICE spacecraft.\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons\nEdited by: Angie Lo\nTaylor Pomfret\n\n"

In April 2021, Security\nwere informed of further reductions to\ntheir annual leave:\n\u2022 The additional 26 hours of leave\nwas removed.\n\u2022 Their annual leave was incorrectly\ncalculated by HR and reduced to\n286.65 hours.\n\u2022 Overtime pay for officers\nworking on Christmas Day was\ncut.\nOn querying the removal of the\n26 hours, management informed\nSecurity that it had been a \u201cone-off\ngoodwill gesture\u201d, and that they would\nnot be receiving it on an annual basis,\ncontradictory to what management\ninitially confirmed.\nFrom 2015, booking a day shift off\nonly cost Security staff 7.5 hours. In\n2021, terms were again changed so that\nSecurity staff needed 12 hours to book\noff a day shift. This extra 4.5 hours per\nshift cost them 9 full shifts worth of\nannual leave. \u201cOver the years they\u2019ve\njust been cutting, cutting,\u201d a member of\nSecurity staff told Felix.\nSecurity also did not understand why\ntheir leave had been further reduced.\nTherefore, they did the calculations\nthemselves and realised that HR had\n[WE WERE]\nROBBED BLIND\nLEFT, RIGHT, AND\nCENTRE.\nIsabella Ward Co-Editor-in-Chief\nAbove: a Silwood Park Security officer\u2019s contract of employment, signed on joining the team in\n2010 .

The number of guards on a shift\nhas been axed over the years: whilst in\n2010 the South Kensington campus\nwas manned by 13-14 Security guards,\nnow there are only 5-6. Security\nunderstands that, as the College have\nsold off parts of the campuses over\nthe years, redundancies are inevitable.\nHowever, they say \u201cthe method by\nwhich the unfortunate members of staff\nwere selected was changed on numerous\noccasions and caused stress and anxiety\nto all concerned\u201d. Allegedly, in 2014\nwhen the number of staff on shift at\nSilwood Park was reduced, the College\nused the number of sick days employees\nhad taken to determine who they would\nmake redundant. Two employees took\nvoluntary redundancy as they had both\nhad extended sick leave shortly before.\nWhen numbers were further reduced\nin 2021, both people chosen to be made\nredundant had extended time off sick\nprior to this with stress related illnesses.\nThe lack of transparency, as Diligence\npersonnel are increasingly \u201ccreeping\ninto the department\u201d, has taken a toll\non workers\u2019 mental health. \u201cWe\u2019ve\nbeen working under duress, strain, not\nwanting to come to work, depression, no\nmotivation, \u201d an officer says. Another,\nwho already suffers with anxiety, tells\nme how he has had to increase his\nmedication recently partly due to the\nstress induced by his employers and\nworkplace.\nSecurity staff even feel that Diligence\nis just another tool in management\u2019s\narsenal to bully Security and force\nacceptance of conditions, under the\nthreat of cutting overtime (as happened\nto a member of the Silwood Park team\nlast week) or even replacement. \u201cthe\n(senior Security team) are narcissists,\nand they rule with fear,\u201d a member of\nSecurity told Felix.\nThere is a clear disregard for the\nwellbeing of their Security staff,\nperhaps exemplified best throughout\nthe pandemic, during which they \u201cfelt\nabandoned,\u201d a Silwood Park officer\nsays. Security asked for screens to be\nput up in their office to protect them,\nwhich management allegedly refused.\nWhen the UK government announced\na change in policy such that people\nin close contact with people who had\ntested positive for the virus did not\nhave to self-isolate if they had been\ndouble vaccinated, management illegally\nattempted to obtain staff\u2019s vaccination\ndata without giving reason or outlining\ndata use. \u201cIt was all very underhand\u201d,\na member of staff says. When this was\nqueried, there was allegedly bullying.\nThe data was reportedly destroyed soon\nafter.\nMoreover, the use of Diligence\nSecurity personnel in Silwood Park\nincreased from December 2020, and\nin preference to offering staff overtime.\nOfficers protested to having to work\nin close proximity with individuals\ntravelling from London during the peak\nof the pandemic and before anyone had\nbeen vaccinated, so the Head of Security\nconfirmed on the 18th December that\nDiligencewouldnotbeused.Contrarily,\nDiligence personnel were used on the\n19th, 20th and 21st. \u201c(Management are)\ndismissive, condescending, and feeding\nlies,\u201d says a Silwood Park officer.\nAt the time, Security guards had\none of the highest death rates from\nCoronavirus. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think how\nto keep us safe,\u201d another says, \u201cthey put\nstaff at risk\u201d. Security staff received a\none-off \u00a3300 payment to recognise their\ncommitmentdespitetheheightenedrisk\nthroughout the pandemic.\nA South Kensington security guard in August 2020.\nDisillusionedwithmanagement,and\nfailed by HR and Unison, Security\nstaff are running out of places to turn.\nWhilst representatives from GMB are\nwelcome to accompany Security staff at\nconsultations, unless they are recognised\nby the College, they have little power to\nstand up for their members\u2019 rights. At\nthe very least, Security staff are owed\nrenumeration for their miscalculated\nannual leave from the last thirteen years,\nbuttheydon\u2019tevendaretohopeforthat.\nAll the ruling of the grievance did\nwas offer false hope; over a year on, no\nsignificant changes have been made.\nIn fact, Security staff allege that they\nhave suffered even more because of the\ngrievance. They now fear retaliation\nfrom management for telling their\nstory to Felix. \u201cI\u2019ve had some colleagues\nsaying you\u2019re going to lose us all our\njobs,\u201d an officer said, \u201cbut if we don\u2019t\nspeak up, management are just going\nto keep doing what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\nIn a university rocked recently by\na bullying scandal, Security staff are\ndismayedthattheirplighthasbeenlargely\nignored: \u201cwhen the (former) CFO and\nPresident got accused of bullying a few\nindividuals, an independent investigator\nwas brought in;\u201d an officer points out,\n\u201cmanagement has been bullying us\nfor years and nothing has been done.\u201d\nFurthermore, they now doubt the\nProvost\u2019s commitment to stamping out\nbullying, following his \u201cdisappointing\u201d\ndisplay of indifference to their situation.\n\u201cI\u2019m disillusioned with Imperial.

Our official policy claims\nthat such enterprises \u2018demonstrate they\nare actively moving towards meeting\nParis Agreement targets\u2019. At best, this\nis laughably na\u00efve. The idea that these\nmultinationals can be cajoled or guilt-tripped into changing their ways at any\nlevel beyond the superficial has been\ndisproven by years of stagnation.\nWhat is needed, beyond cheaper\nrenewables, beyond fancy carbon-capture technology, beyond lofty ideas\nof \u2018green growth\u2019, is a war footing.\nThe public, our institutions, and our\ngovernments alike must start to see these\ncompaniesforwhattheyare\u2013theenemy.\nFossil fuels remain more profitable than\nrenewables. In 2022 the five largest oil\nand gas companies made nearly $200\nbillion, their highest profit margin in\nhistory. They are not going to stop on\ntheir own. They must be defunded,\ndismantled, and disgraced.\nA recent paper in the Harvard\nEnvironmental Law Review advocated\nfor prosecuting these companies on the\ncharge of homicide; this would hold\nthem directly accountable for any deaths\nprovably connected to anthropogenic\nclimate change. Some may see such a\nroute as radical or ridiculous. I see it as\nthe harbinger of a cultural shift that will\ncome to seem pivotal. Above anything\nelse, this is the attitude that we lack, that\nwe desperately need to acquire. This is\nthe attitude that will turn the tide.\nAnd the tide will turn.

Originally named \u2018mayonnaise de chocolat\u2019 by its inventor\nHenri Toulouse Lautrec in the 19th\ncentury, it has become a staple in\nthe French desserts category, and\nits recipe has been changed more\ntimes than the UK has changed\nprime ministers.\nMy French mother often made\na simple, yet show-stopping\nchocolate mousse that was always\nthe hit\nof\nthe\nevening.\nIt consists\nonly of eggs,\ndark chocolate,\nand a bit of milk\nand salt. Of course,\nyou can add anything else\n\u2013 such as orange or lemon\nzest, or perhaps a raspberry\nsauce on top.

Avoid melting the\nchocolate directly in a pot, to prevent burning.\nStep 2: Meanwhile, separate the eggs and beat the egg whites with a little sprinkle of salt,\nuntil you can turn the bowl upside down without the egg whites falling out.\nStep 3: Once the chocolate has melted, take it off the heat and wait for the chocolate to cool down\nuntil you can put your (thoroughly-washed) hand inside the chocolate without burning yourself\n(around 45\u00b0C). Stir and mix the chocolate with a little milk until the consistency is silky smooth.\nTrust the process, and stir, stir, stir. Add more milk if the chocolate looks too thick.\nStep 4: Mix the egg yolks into the chocolate. Add milk if necessary to further silken the\nconsistency.\nStep 5: With a spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mix. Don\u2019t over-mix, to avoid\nletting the air escape, and you\u2019ll get another batter-like consistency. Once all white clumps are\ngone, add the chocolate mousse to your bowls/cups/glasses.\nStep 6: Place into the fridge for at least 4 hours.\nStep 7: Decorate. Some ideas are:\n\u2022 Cover the top with a single layer of blueberries and lightly cover the blueberries with a\nchocolate sauce. Put into the fridge again to allow the chocolate to harden.\n\u2022 Sprinkle the top with some chocolate chips/sprinkles and add a mint leaf so the mousse resembles a plant growing out of soil.\n\u2022 Prepare a berry compote (melt berries with a little sugar in a pot) and add to the top.\nFinally, my mom\u2019s favourite: prepare the chocolate mousse in a champagne glass and serve it like\na cocktail with an orange slice on the edge of the glass.\nStep 8: Enjoy!\nServing method: prepare individual bowls, champagne glasses,\nor glass cups for individual serving portions.\nIllustration\nby Kaiwen Li\n\n"

This means infants\ningest, inhale, and have skin-exposure to\nmicroplastics that cannot be dealt with\nsimply.\nCompostable plastics\nThe new plant-based plastics \u2013 the kind\nthat you see with a green leaf symbol on\nthem \u2013 are called \u2018bioplastics\u2019. They are\nderived from plants, but bioplastic isn\u2019t\nso different to the plastics made from\npetrochemicals, and they can also take\nyears to break down. \u201cYou might think\nthat compostable plastics are green and\ngood for the environment, but it will\nonly fully compost if it enters industrial\ncomposting because it requires very\nspecific temperatures and oxygen and\npH to actually degrade,\u201d Dr Wright\nsays. \u201cWe are currently studying this.\nAlthoughitisnotyetpublished,itseems\nthat there are still bits of \u2018compostable\u2019\nplastic left at the end of the composting\nprocess \u2013 which will end up in the\nenvironment when the compost is reapplied to land. The required conditions\nneeded to break it down don\u2019t apply\nthere with respect to the oxygen, the\ntemperature, and the pH \u2013 so it won\u2019t\nreally compost any further. They will\nend up in soils, water bodies, and air \u2013\njust like the other microplastics.\u201d\n\u201cBioplastics can degrade a bit\ndifferently in the body, releasing\n\u2018oligomers\u2019 that are smaller than bits\nof polymer \u2013 which can lead to acute\ninflammation, and accumulate in the\nliver, intestine, and brain\u201d. This means\nplant-based plastics create their own\nhealth risks.\nWhen you see \u2018compostable\u2019 teabags,\ntheyaremostprobablymadeofpolylactic\nacid. Brewing a teabag made with PET\n(the most common thermoplastic) and\nPA (nylon) at 95\u00b0C can shed up to 11.6\nbillion micro- and nanoparticles into a\ncup of tea. This is over 200,000 times\nthe maximum number found in a pint of\nbeer. I am not aware of a study looking\nat the shedding of polylactic acid, but\nI would not be surprised if it were of a\nsimilar magnitude. When I found this\nout, I started to brew my tea loose, or\ntear open a teabag and throw it away\nbefore it reaches the water if that is the\nonly option I have. Drinking tea might\ntherefore be people\u2019s highest exposure\nto ingested plastic, but Dr Wright says\n\u201cI\u2019d want to see a bit more evidence, and\nmore studies repeating that, to see if it\nreally is a phenomenon or if it was a oneoff.\u201d\nTyres\nNew evidence suggests that vehicle tyre\nwear pollution in urban areas could pose\nenvironmental risk up to 10,000 times\nhigher than other microplastics found in\nEuropean rivers.\nAboutaquarterofatyreisplastic,and\nthis may account for 5\u201310% of ocean\nmicroplasticsglobally.Itisestimatedthat\n3 billion tyres reach the end of their lives\neach year, generating 2,907,000 tonnes\nof tyre wear particles per year globally.\nResuspended road microplastics,\nincluding the plastics used to make road\nmarkings, could contribute up to 84% of\nplastics in the air.\nLarge tyre wear particles are part of\nroad runoff on rainy days, resulting in\nthe leaching of toxic chemicals. Smaller\nparticles \u2013 of the micro and nanoscale \u2013\nmaybesmallenoughtobecomeairborne\nand get breathed in.\nConversations that I\u2019ve had with\nresearchers in this area have led me\nto believe that as new tyres are being\ndeveloped to shed fewer large particles,\nthey may actually be shedding more fine\nparticles that could cause greater harm\nto the environment. As the materials are\ndesigned to be less prone to breaking\napart, this may lead to less degradable\nparticles that pollute our environment\nfor much longer.\nThis is another huge reason to reduce\nall private car transport, rather than\npushing people to buy electric cars. We\nneed emphasis on moving away from the\nreliance on cars where we can. \u201cFewer\ncars means less tyre wear\u201d, Dr Wright\nsays. Rather than literally reinventing\nthewheel,weneedtoreducethenumber\nof tyres by using and campaigning\nfor public transport and reducing the\namount we travel.\nCigarette butts\nThe UK government\u2019s ambition of a\nsmoke-free country by 2030 will help to\nreduce the most prolific item of plastic\npollution in the oceans \u2013 cigarette butts.\nCellulose acetate, the plastic comprising\ncigarette filters, is not biodegradable\nunder normal natural conditions.\nAccording to Dr Ruediger Krech from\nthe WHO, they contain over 7000 toxic\nchemicals and roughly 4.5 trillion butts\npollute our environment every year. This\neffectively means every smoker throws\nnine out of ten cigarette filters directly\ninto the environment.\nCigarette companies have worked\nhard to make cigarette butts look like\nthey are made of paper, cork, or natural\nfibres. I was surprised to find out that\nonly 60% of members of tobacco control\nadvocacy groups, which supports the\nimplementation of the World Health\nOrganization\u2019s Framework Convention\non Tobacco Control, knew they were\nmade of plastic. A study of 7532\nundergraduate students in the United\nStates showed 70% of men and 60%\nof women believed that cigarette butts\nwere biodegradable.\nBesides stopping smoking completely,\nthe alternative solution here is to carry\na personal pocket ashtray to avoid\ndiscarding cigarette butts into the\nenvironment.\nWhat do microplastics do to your\nbody?\n\u201cEven if a microplastic particle is\ninert, the body will try to get rid of\nit. In doing so, cells in the body will\ntrigger inflammation \u2013 which is a\nnatural response to foreign entities.\nBut if it happens all the time, then it\nis a problem. In the worst cases, this\n\u2018chronic inflammation\u2019 can cause tissue\nscarring if unresolved,\u201d Dr Wright says.\nIn the same way that air pollution causes\ninflammation leading to over seven\nmillion deaths every year according\nto the WHO, inhaled or ingested\nmicroplastics and nanoplastics might\ncause the same kind of inflammation.\nThe scale of the direct harm to human\nhealth from microplastics is expected to\nbe less than from air pollution, but the\nenvironmental impacts are expected to\nbe far worse.\nMicroplastic effects on nature\nAttheendoftheirjourney,microplastics\nand nanoplastics reach the soil and\nthe ocean. In 2020, there were over\n400,000 incidences of water companies\ndischarging untreated sewage into rivers\nand coastal waters in England \u2013 each of\nthese incidences release microplastics\ninto aquatic ecosystems.\nThese microplastics have been shown\nto stunt the growth of earthworms,\nsignificantly affect the behaviour of fish\nlarvae,andkillwaterfleas.Thelikelihood\nofcoraldiseaseincreasesfrom4%to89%\nwhen they are in contact with plastic.\nI asked Dr Wright if these plastic\nparticles might bioaccumulate \u2013 passing\nup the food chain, getting\nmore concentrated as they go.\n\u201cBioaccumulation would only occur if\nthey\u2019re building up in the gut or other\ntissues, which means they\u2019ve got to be\n\u2018bioavailable\u2019 \u2013 meaning they are taken\ninthroughthegut,acrosstheepithelium,\nand into tissues.

    "content": "Iam a beer drinker. Not much, perhaps\none or two a week, but I enjoy them.\nHowever, after reading a paper from\n2022 that reports there are up to 50,000\nmicroplastic particles in a pint of beer,\nit started to put me off. Then I found\nout it\u2019s not just plastic particles that get\nintobeer,butalsocompoundsthatmake\nplastic soft, called plasticisers \u2013 which\ncan leach out of plastic tubing during\nthe beer-making process. The more I\ninvestigated microplastics, the wider\nthe problem appeared. We have a global\nmicroplastic problem that is totally out\nof control. But is this a health problem?\nAnd if so, what can we do about it?\nI spoke with Dr Stephanie Wright,\na lecturer in environmental toxicology\nat Imperial College. She has researched\nmicroplastic exposure and its biological\nimpacts for over 12 years.\nHow does plastic get into beer?\n\u201cFirstly, the water source might have\nplastic fragments or fibres in it,\u201d Dr\nWright starts off. \u201cWe know that\nfreshwaters, including groundwater, are\ncontaminated with microplastics from\nplastic waste breaking down, tyre wear,\nsynthetic fibres from clothes, and waste\ndirectly from industry \u2013 but definitely\nnot at the levels found in the beer in this\nstudy.\u201d\nMicroplastics are tiny pieces of\nplastic smaller than 5mm in length.\nResearch from the Centre for Ecology\n& Hydrology shows untreated water\ncontains 4.9 microplastics per litre on\naverage, while treated water in the UK\nholds only 1 microplastic per 10,000\nlitres. Clearly, for 50,000 microplastics\nto get into each of our pints there\nmust be a more significant source.\n\u201cThe water would have to be to be very\ncontaminated,\u201d Dr Wright says.\n\u201cSecondly, it could be coming\nfrom the factory.\u201d But the 2022 study\nshowed that microplastics were mainly\nfragments rather than fibres, so clothing\nfrom workers, for example, seemed an\nunlikely source.\n\u201cLastly, plastic components in\npackaging and machinery are likely to\nbe a key source. Plastic isn\u2019t as stable as\nwe once thought it was \u2013 it can quite\neasily shear and release microscopic and\nnanoscopic particles,\u201d Dr Wright says.\nMy image of a brewery is of metal vats\nand glass, so where is the polystyrene?\nDr Wright says that classifying plastics\ncan be challenging. \u201cThe biggest\nchallenge is minimising contamination\nduring analysis \u2013 that\u2019s the art. Then,\ncomparing the chemical fingerprint of\na microplastic to a known library can\nbe tricky. You might think \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got\npolystyrene.\u2019 \u2013 but it\u2019s actually sulfonic\nacid or something different. I wonder\nif, on a first glance, you record it as\npolystyrene when it might be something\nelse.\u201d\nMight it be safer to drink beer from\ncans or bottles, or draught beer from a\ntap? \u201cThere\u2019s just so much variation,\u201d Dr\nWright says. \u201cThe role of batch-to-batch\nvariation versus factory-to-factory,\nbrand-to-brand, process-to-process. You\nmight think that drinking from a glass\nbottle would contain less plastic, but\nthat might not be the case. Sometimes\nbeverages in glass bottles can contain\nmore plastic particles that in plastic\ncontainers. Cans have their own issue,\nbeing lined with a polymer inside. There\nare too many variables and not enough\nevidence to be able to conclude how to\nreduce your microplastic exposure from\nbeer\u201d.\nProcessed foods\nI asked Dr Wright about processed\nfoods, where microplastics might be a\nbigger issue than in beer. The tubing that\nis used in food processing is soft because\nit contains plasticisers. \u201cPlasticisers are\nnot chemically bound to the plastic\npolymer, which means they\u2019re highly\nsusceptible to leaching into whatever the\nsurrounding medium is. That could be\nfoodordrink.Theymimictheshapeand\nstructure of a lot of naturally occurring\nmolecules such as hormones. There is a\nlot of epidemiological evidence linking\nwhat we call \u2018exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals\u2019 with issues of\nfertility and reproduction,\u201d Dr Wright\nsays.\nFrom1965to2015,therewasa32.5%\ndecrease in sperm concentration in\nEuropean men. According to the United\nStates CDC, between 2015 and 2019,\n8.9% of American women required\nmedical help to get pregnant. One\nof the causes could be environmental\nchemicals \u2013 such as phthalates, which\nis a widespread plasticiser in consumer\nproducts.\nBPA is a chemical found in plastics\nthat are often used in containers that\nstore food and drinks. \u201cIt is recognised\nas an endocrine-disrupting chemical\u201d,\nDr Wright says, \u201cand it was banned from\nall sorts of children\u2019s toys, babies\u2019 bottles\n\u2013 and now a lot of products are opting to\nbe BPA-free. The problem is, what is it\nbeing substituted with? There are more\nsynthetic compounds that are essentially\nthere to do the same job, which have a\nvery similar structure, and so do the\nsame thing in our bodies.\u201d\nBabies\u2019 bottles\nSoft plastic is used in babies\u2019 bottles,\nand store-bought baby food is often\nprocessed. Could their exposure to\nplasticisers be a health risk? \u201cThis is [a]\nclear way for a plasticiser to be leaching\nintothefoodthatthebabyisconsuming\u201d,\nDr Wright says. \u201cAlso, heating plastics\nweakens the material, so sterilising\nbabies\u2019 bottles and mouthpieces likely\ncauses these plasticisers to leach at\na faster rate. This also causes greater\nshedding of microplastic particles\u201d.\nUsing plastic water bottles until they\nbecome brittle indicates that all the\nplasticiserhasleachedoutintotheliquid.\nUsing metal or glass containers will\nreduce your exposure to microplastics\nand plasticisers, and buying them\nsecond-hand will reduce the carbon\nemissions from producing them.\nBut with babies\u2019 hand-to-mouth\nbehaviour, it is common for them to\nbe exposed to microplastics in dust\nfrom synthetic fibres from clothes,\nfurniture, bedding, curtains, carpets,\nand upholstery. Indoor air contains\nmuch more airborne plastic than\noutdoors \u2013 with between 5,000 and\n900,000 microplastics settling every\nsquare metre, compared to between 0\nThere\u2019s microplastics in my beer?\nenvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk felixonline.co.uk\nPete Knapp Environment Writer\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEnvironmentt\nENVIRONMENT\nImperial\u2019s Dr Stephanie Wright shares her thoughts on the invisible particles threatening our health and biodiversity.\nEdited by: Simran Patel\nMarie Mori\n12\nCredit: Envato Elements\n\n"
