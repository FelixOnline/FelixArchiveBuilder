B&H Buildings, Clerkenwell\nWhen? Mondays, 7-9.30pm\nHow much? \u00a36 concession per class\nThis session is part of Adrian Dutton\u2019s London\nLife Drawing classes, which happen at various\nlocations around London, including in Hoxton\nand Bethnal Green. This particular class is un-tutored, held in a small, intimate space below a\nbeautifully decorated pub. It is drop-in, and does\nnot often fill up, although it only fits a maximum\nof around 15 people. The small space means\nthat there is a lot of interaction among artists,\nand a closer view of the model. However, there is\nno music played, which makes the session eerily\nquiet.\nLondon Life Drawing\n(Bethnal Green)\nWhere? Eastbourne House, Bethnal Green\nWhen? Thursdays and Fridays, 7-9.30pm\nHow much? \u00a36 concession per class\nThis was another of Adrian Dutton\u2019s series\nof classes that I tried, specifically the\u2018Cheese\nand Wine\u2019night that happens every Thursday\nevening. On Friday evenings, there is a long\nposes class at the same venue at the same time.\nThis is held in a large gallery-like space in an\nold building, with the artists sitting in a large\nrectangle around the model. It is tutored, and\nthe tutor walks around the class observing your\nwork, giving useful feedback and advice. During\nthe break cheese and wine is provided, which is\nnice.\nLife Drawing with the ELSC\nWhere? Crown and Shuttle pub, Shoreditch\nWhen? Mondays, 7-9.30pm\nHow much? \u00a315, free materials for students\nELSC stands for East London Strippers Collective. Yes, you heard it right. This session is run\nby the people at ELSC who hope to challenge\nthe stereotypes of strippers and make sure their\nvoices are heard. As part of that effort, they run\na weekly life drawing session at an ex strip club,\nthe Crown and Shuttle, with dynamic poses\nby striptease dancers. This is a good chance to\npractice capturing life drawing in motion, as the\nmodels practice what the organisers call\u2018stripfreeze\u2019- where they freeze in various one minute\nposes in the midst of doing a dance routine.\nDefinitely a fun and unique experience!\nAdrian Dutton\u2019s London life drawing class at Bethnal Green // Adrian Dutton\nWhere? Artizan Street Library, Aldgate & Waterloo Action Centre, Waterloo\nWhen? Monday-Wednesday, 7-9pm\nHow much? \u00a310 per class\nMonday evening classes are held at Artizan\nStreet Library, while Tuesday and Wednesday\nclasses are held at Waterloo Action Centre. These\nare drop-in sessions and there is no need to\nbook.\nLondon Drawing drop-in classes\n\u2018Drink and Draw\u2019at The Exhibit\nWhere? The Exhibit bar, Balham\nWhen? Wednesdays, 7.30-9.30pm\nHow much? \u00a38.50 per class\nThis tutored class is run by Dan Whiteson, who\nalso runs several other life drawing classes at\nvarious other locations throughout London,\nincluding the pub The Prince in Stoke Newington. This class is located on the top floor function room of The Exhibit, a pretty pub just a two\nminute walk from Balham station. It is billed as\n\u2018drink and draw\u2019as participants are encouraged\nto bring a pint from the bar up with them to\nthe class. Materials are provided, and generally\neveryone gets a good view of the model. Tickets\nhave to be bought in advance online from Dan\u2019s\nwebsite. The poses are generally refreshing, and\nDan talks continuously throughout the class,\ngiving very useful creative exercises and advice\nabout drawing more freely. However, note that\nthese exercises and advice tend to repeat every\nweek, which is great for first-time attenders but\nmay get repetitive after the second session.\nLife drawing at Village\nUnderground\nWhere? Village Underground, Shoreditch\nWhen? Next one is on Monday 4 December,\n7.30-9.30pm\nHow much? \u00a316\nThis can be described as nothing less than a life\ndrawing extravaganza. Happening every few\nmonths, it is run by Dan Whiteson, the guy behind\u2018Drink and Draw\u2019at The Exhibit. This session\ninvolves several models in a large, open and\ncreative space, experimenting with interesting\nposes. The event aims to explore the impact of\nsound and music on visual expression against a\nbackdrop of an eclectic playlist. Like in his regular classes, Dan is expected to provide plenty of\nfriendly guidance and lots of creative exercises\ndesigned to stretch your skills.\nCovent Garden life drawing\nWhere? Candid Arts Centre, Islington\nWhen? Mondays to Thursdays, 7-9pm\nHow much? \u00a39 per class\nLocated in the expansive Candid Arts Centre\nwhich is housed in two Victorian warehouses in\nIslington (near Angel station), this class is run\non a drop-in basis on Mondays to Thursdays\nfrom 7-9pm, with daytime classes on Tuesdays\nto Thursdays from 11am - 1pm. There is no need\nto book, but do arrive early as these are quite\npopular. The sessions are tutored with one tutor\neach class.\nWhere? Society of Friends Meeting House,\nCovent Garden\nWhen? Thursdays, 7-9pm\nHow much? \u00a314 per class\nThe pros of this class is that it is very central, and\nalways has a male and female model each time.\nHowever, it is quite pricey for nothing very spe-cial, and classes are huge, with the space able\nto accommodate more than 50 artists. Materials\nare not provided but are for sale. That said, the\nquality of models are said to be of a high professional standard and there is a friendly vibe.\nCandid Arts life drawing class\nLife drawing at Village Underground // Village Underground\n\n"

In a number of cases,\nalumni were not asked\nfor explicit permission to\nshare their data \u2013 at the\nUniversity of Cambridge,\nfor example, the fact that\ndata could be passed on\nto external companies is\nmentioned in their online\ndata protection state-ments.\nInastatement,aCollege\nspokesperson told Felix:\nICO to launch investigation into wealth screening\n\u201cImperial\u2019s community of\nalumni, friends, and supporters is very important\nto us.

They said: \u201cany\ndata provided was done\nso on a strictly confidential basis, and details of\nCollege alumni or donors\nhas never been sold to any\nthird parties.\u201d\nElizabeth Dehman,\nInformation Commissioner, said that the ICO\nwill \u201clook carefully at\nthe individual evidence...\nto see if, and where, any\nrules have been broken,\nand what learning there is\nfor wider practice in this\narea\u201d. She added the ICO\nhas \u201cbeen working with\nthe Fundraising Regulator\nand talking to universities\nabout their responsibilities around transparency\nand accountability, as\nthey prepare to comply\nwith a new, stronger data\nprotection law\u201d.\nA spokesperson for\nthe Russell Group said\n\u201cphilanthropy is helping\nwiden access to higher\neducation and improve\nthe learning experience\nuniversities are able to\nprovide\u201d, but said that\nthey take their alumni\u2019s\nprivacy \u201cvery seriously\u201d. All Russell Group\nuniversities in England\nand Wales are registered\nwith the Fundraising\nRegulator, an independent\nvoluntary regulator of the\ncharity sector.\nDaniel Fluskey, Head\nof Policy at the Institute\nof Fundraising, a professional membership\nbody for UK fundraising,\nsaid that such screening\n\u201c[helps] organisations to\nraise money in a more\nefficient way\u201d, and that it\nis \u201ca needed and increasingly important part of\nfundraising\u201d.\nNEWS\n(cont.)\nOxford, Cambridge, and\nManchester. As well as\nstrikes, union members\ncould refuse to cover or\nreschedule classes, or\ncover for sick colleagues.\nThe current principal\npensions scheme used in\nhigher education is the\nUniversity Superannuation Scheme (USS). It is\na defined benefit pension\nscheme, in which the\nemployer is responsible\nfor contributions, up to a\nsalary of \u00a355,550, after\nwhich it switched over\nto a defined contribution\nscheme, in which the\nargues this will make\npensions dependent on\nmarket returns. Hunt said\nit was \u201cthe worst proposal\nI have received in twenty\nyears of representing\nuniversity staff\u201d, saying\nUCU \u201cneeds to fight it\u201d.\nTimes Higher Education previously reported\na number of universities,\nincluding Imperial, were\nunwilling to cover the increased cost of pensions,\nand supported a move\nto a defined contribution\nscheme. In 2015-16,\nImperial spent more than\n\u00a380 million on pension\nprovisions, but also made\na profit of \u00a378 million\nover the same time period.\nIn an email to staff,\nImperial\u2019s Provost,\nProfessor James Stirling,\nrecognised that \u201ccurrent\nuncertainty regarding the\n[USS] is unsettling for\ncolleagues\u201d. He went on\nto say that while \u201cwe have\nsaid that our preference\nwould be to maintain a\ndefined benefit structure\nfor USS\u201d that current\ninformation suggests it \u201cis\nnot likely to be sustainable at the moment\u201d, and\nthat \u201ca move to a defined\ncontribution scheme, at\nleast temporarily, would\nbe necessary\u201d.\nUUK chief executive\nAlistair Jarvis said: \u201cMost\nuniversities can\u2019t afford\nto pay more into pensions\nwithout diverting money\nfrom other central areas,\nsuch as teaching and re-search, reducing their positive impact.\u201d USS argues\nthe scheme currently has a\ndeficit of \u00a37.5 billion.\nDr Michael McGarvey,\nPresident of Imperial\nCollege UCU, said in a\nstatement that \"independ-ent bodies have challenged [UUK's] claims as\nbeing partisan and based\non unrealistically negative\nassumptions.\" He went on\nto state that \"Imperial has\nspent nearly \u00a3500 million\nof its own money over\nthe last three years on its\nestate. The employers\ncannot plead poverty, and\nany claim that fees will\nhave to be raised to pay\nfor staff pensions has no\nbasis in fact.\"\nThe UCU claims\nuniversities have reduced\nspending on staff as a proportion of expenditure by\n5% over the last ten years,\nand argued the decision to\nswitch from the USS was\nnot inevitable. She called\nthe move \u201canother slap in\nthe face for people already\nfacing casual contracts\nand poor promotion prospects\u201d.\nA consultative ballot\nwas launched by UCU\nlast month, which found\n87% of members would\nbe willing to walk out\nover the pension changes.\nThe ballot had a turnout of\n56%.\nThe USS is one of the\nlargest private pension\nschemes in the UK, with\naround 190,000 staff in-volved.

These\nreceptionists and security\nstaff are contracted out,\nmeaning that their de\njure employer isn\u2019t the\nuniversity itself, and\nthey therefore miss out\non the same employment\nbenefits as \u2018regular\u2019 em-ployees. They also don\u2019t\nhave the right to negotiate\nwith the University of\nLondon directly, but that\ncould soon change: if the\ncase is successful, the\nUoL will be recognised as\ntheir de facto employer,\nwhich could open the\ndoors for many contracted\nemployees.\nHere at Imperial, we\noutsource our cleaning\nstaff to Noonan, an\nexternal contractor. The\nuniversity says that they\nensure that all external-ly-contracted staff are paid\n\u00a310/hour, which \u2013 while\naboveminimum\u2013isbelow\nthe London Living Wage.\nIn such situations, these\nstaff also lack the right\nto directly negotiate for\nchanges to their employ-ment. I\u2019m not necessarily\nsaying this is the case with\nImperial, but all too often\nthis arrangement can be\nused to allow institutions\nto maintain a surface\nappearance of being an\nethical employer, whilst\nenabling contractors to\nenforce poor working\nstandards. I\u2019m hoping that\nthis case will help bring\nthis practice to light, not\njust at higher education\ninstitutions, but across the\ncountry, paving the way\nfor greater transparency,\nand better workers\u2019 rights.\nThe second story that\nreally caught my eye was\nabout potential industrial\naction that might be\ncarried out by academics\ncome February. In this\ncase, staff are upset about\nchanges to their pension\nschemes, which many\nfear could make them\nworse off. Dr Michael\nMcGarvey, the President\nof the Imperial branch\nof the University and\nCollege Union, said that\nthe move would reduce\nstaff pensions by a\nmassive amount. He also\nsaid that it\u2019s important to\nremember that Imperial\nhas spent nearly half a\nbillion pounds over the\nlast three years on its\nestate \u2013 \u201cthe employers,\u201d\nhe said \u201ccannot plead\npoverty\u201d.\nFelix is here to represent the students, but\nwe can\u2019t do that without\nrepresenting staff too.\nWhile it can be tempting\nto see all staff as \u2018the\nenemy\u2019, it\u2019s important to\nremember that they can\nbe messed around just as\nmuch as us. This dispute\nabout pensions shows\nthat \u2013 it\u2019s never been more\nimportant for us all to\nstick together.\nFred Fyles \u2013 Felix Editor\n2\n\u201cThe College\nspokeperson\nsaid that\nImperial last\nused wealth\nscreening\nfirms in 2015,\nand was no\nlonger using\nthem\u201d\n\u201cImperial\nstated that\nthe current\npension\nscheme was\n'not likely to be\nsustainable'\u201d\nemployee pays into the\nscheme.\nUUK proposes to end\nthe USS, and switch over\nto a fully defined contribution scheme.

For many\nlocals it felt like a poignant\nexample of gentrification,\nat a time when much of\neast London is suffering\nfrom a widening inequality gap. Ultimately this\ndisconnect led to massive\nprotests along Brick Lane,\ncumulating with red paint\nbeing thrown at the caf\u00e9\nexpansion, endless Instagram shots, and numerous\narticles enticing tourists to\nvisit the cafe, the product\nmust be great, right?\nI went to check out the\noriginal Brick Lane cafe\nto see if it really is \u2018Worth\nthe hype\u2019.\nFirst impressions\nUpon entering the\ncafe I was overwhelmed\nwith the bright colours\nof cereal boxes stacked\non the walls, and the energetic atmosphere of the\nyoung tourists grinning\nwith the prospect of their\nsugary \u2018meal\u2019. Looking\naround, I was intrigued to\nfind a portrait of Dexter\nmade entirely of Cheerios\nhanging on the wall \u2013 who\nknew that art and cereal\ncould go so well together!\nBehind the counter where\nthe \u2018chefs\u2019 were busy preparing the bowls were the\nnumerous boxes of cereals\nyou could choose including American classics\nsuch as Lucky Charms,\nFruity Pebbles and\nCaptain Crunch, as well\nas seven (!) different types\nof Cheerios.

Fortunately milk\nis served on the side in a\nlittle glass bottle so there\nwere no worries of soggy\ncereal. I poured about\nhalf of my milk onto my\nextremely chocolatey\ncombination and took\nmy first spoonful.

While there are\nstrong arguments to made\nthat artworks shouldn\u2019t\nreally be compared in\nsuch a cut-throat way \u2013 let\nalone be placed in a glad-iatorial, fight-to-the-death\ncompetition, hinged on\nexpensive gifts given by\nsleazy men and women\nto even sleazier men\nand women over boozy\ndinners \u2013 it is certainly\na satisfying feeling for\nanyone who has struggled\nthrough years of blood,\nsweat, and tears to receive\nrecognition for their work\nfrom audiences, critics,\nand their peers alike.\nMore or less all of the\nmajor contenders have\nstepped up to the plate,\nwith only a couple left\nto emerge. The tactics\nbehind running a successful awards season\ncampaign, from marketing\nand release dates, through\nfestival appearances and\ncritics screenings, is an\nencyclopaedia\u2019s worth of\nwords. Let\u2019s focus instead\non who has a chance of\nhaving their name read\nout when the Oscar nominations are announced on\nthe 23rd\nof January, and,\nmore importantly, when\nthe golden statuettes are\nhanded out on March 4th\n.\nOut of the race\nIt is often possible\nto make fairly decent\nguesses at who will be\ninvolved in the awards\nconversation well over\na year in advance, based\non the reputation of a\nfavoured director or the\nsubject matter a given film\nmay involve. Two artists\nwho have strong status\namongst the Academy in\nrecent years are Kathryn\nBigelow and Alexander\nPayne. Bigelow became\nthe first woman to win the\nAcademy Award for Best\nDirector for her film The\nHurt Locker, which won\nsix Oscars from nine nom-inations, including Best\nPicture. Three years later,\nshe followed this up with\nthe five-time nominated\nZero Dark Thirty, and\nthis summer she released\nDetroit, another modern\nhistorical drama. While\nwell-reviewed, it has not\nreceived the same level of\nunanimous praise of her\nprevious two, and this,\ncoupled with the summer\nrelease, means that Detroit\nis unlikely to register with\nDownsizing attempts to\nbring his unique blend\nof comedy and drama to\nsciencefiction,withmixed\nresults. The Academy will\nnot bite this time round.\nManaging to garner the\nOscar for Best Original\nScreenplay with just\nher second film, Sofia\nCoppola looked set to\nfollow in her father\u2019s\nfootsteps to awards great-ness. Since then her fare\nhas proved too arthouse\nfor the Academy. It was\nthought that her latest,\nThe Beguiled, a remake\nof a seventies Clint\nEastwood vehicle with a\ndistinctly feminist flavour,\ncould bring her back into\nthe winners\u2019 circle. But\nwhile it won her the Best\nDirector Prize at Cannes,\nit is not carrying enough\nbuzz to bring further\nawards attention. Similarly, DarrenAronofsky, who\nhas at times flirted with\nawards season but generally proved too gritty, will\nnot be in the mix with his\ndivisive Mother!. Critics\nwere split, and audiences\ngenerally hated it.\nAmazon announced\nthemselves as a major\nawards season player last\nyear, with Manchester\nby the Sea winning\ntwo Oscars from six\nnominations. This year\ntheir end of year releases\nwere set to include You\nWere Never Really Here,\nLast Flag Flying, and\nWonder Wheel. The\nformer received universal\nacclaim at Cannes, and\nwon the Best Actor prize\nfor Joaquin Phoenix\nand the Best Screenplay\nPrize for director Lynne\nRamsay. Amazon have\nsince deemed the film\ntoo abrasive for the\ntinues his mediocre collaboration with Amazon,\nthough Kate Winslet may\nbe in the running for a\nBest Actress nomination.\nFrom Richard Linklater,\nwho came close to taking\nhome a number of big\nprizes for Boyhood, Last\nFlag Flying is a sequel to\nHal Ashby\u2019s wonderful\nThe Last Detail. In spite\nof the strong cast, including Bryan Cranston, Steve\nCarrell, and Laurence\nFishburne, warm yet\nmuted reviews and box\noffice struggles mean that\nthis picture will not be in\nthe minds of Academy\nvoters. Rival Netflix has\nbeen a lot less successful\nwith launching awards\ncampaigns due to their\napparent allergy to 90-day\ntheatrical windows, and\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s The\nMeyerowitz Stories: New\nand Selected will be lost\namidst this.\nAt the top of the year\nit was thought that Logan\nmay be able to get some\nplay, considering its\nobvious parallels with\nWesterns. This excitement\nseemingly stemmed from\na select group who seem\ndesperate for a superhero\nflick to earn Oscar nods,\n\u201cWhile Detroit\nwas well-reviewed, it\u2019s\nunlikely to\nregister with\nAcademy\nvoters\u201d\nAcademy voters. Similarly, Payne has been a staple\nat the Oscars, winning the\nBest Adapted Screenplay\naward twice. A director\nrenowned for his depictions of men entering\ntransformative existential\ncrises at breaking points\nin their lives, Payne\u2019s\n\u201cNetflix have\nbeen less\nsuccessful\nwith awards,\ndue to their\nallergy to 90-day theatrical\nwindows\u201d\nAcademy\u2019s liking, and\npushed the release date to\nFebruary next year, ruling\nit out of the running. The\nlatter is the latest from\nWoody Allen, and con-The Meyerowitz Stories and Killing of a Sacred Deer are unlikely to win, but I like them, so they\u2019re going here // Netflix/A24\n\u201cNew\nproducers A24\nwill be looking\nto recreate last\nyear\u2019s huge\nsuccess\u201d\n\u201cBlade Runner\n2049 may\ndo well in a\nnumber of\ntechnical\ncategories\u201d\nand has since dwindled.\nAnother Hugh Jackman\nvehicle, The Greatest\nShowman, has yet to\nscreen for critics. There\nis very little buzz with\nthis one, and early word\nemanating from the studio\nis that it is not very good.\nAmongst the furore\nof fledgling production\ncompany A24 seeing\nMoonlight all the way\nto a famously last-ditch\nBest Picture win last\nyear, it was forgotten that\nanother of their films,\nThe Lobster, picked up\nan Original Screenplay\nnod for director Yorgos\nLanthimos. His follow up,\npsychological horror The\nKilling of a Sacred Deer,\npicked up the very same\nprize at Cannes this year;\nbut the small yet potent\ndistribution company,\nhailed by many as the\nsaviour of cinema, seems\nrelease in late December,\nin spite of the fact that\nthey have removed the\ndisgraced Kevin Spacey\nfrom the project and are\nreshooting with original\nfirst choice Christopher\nPlummer. Scott has had\nlimited pull with the\nAcademy since his best\npicture win for Gladiator\nin 2000, a notable exception being 2015\u2019s The\nMartian.\nDan Gilroy\u2019s 2014\ndebut Nightcrawler did\nnot pick up nearly as much\nattention with voters as\nit should have done. He\nreturns with a strong cast\nfor his sophomore effort\nRoman J. Israel, Esq.,\nthough average reviews\nmean that this one is\nout of the race. David\nGordon Green\u2019s drama\nStronger, following a\nman who loses his legs\nafter the Boston Marathon\nbombing, is lacking\nawards traction in spite\nof good reviews, though\nJake Gyllenhaal may\nwell land a long-overdue\nsecond Oscar nomination.\nStephen Frears is the type\nof director whose films\nused to play well to the\nAcademy but no longer\nresonate as the voting\npool is freshened and\ndiversified, sinking the\nhopes of his Victoria and\nAbdul.\nLong shots\nIt was a pleasant\nsurprise to many when\nMad Max: Fury Road\ngarnered 10 Oscar nominations and won the most\nof the night two years\nago. It was the best English-language film of the\nyear \u2013 along with more\ntraditional awards fare\nCarol and eventual best\npicture winner Spotlight\n\u2013 and its success signalled\nthe Academy\u2019s intent\nto include more diverse\nmaterial. Many had\nhoped that Blade Runner\n2049, another revival of\na classic dystopian film of\nthe eighties, could repeat\nthat success, especially\nwith the in-form Denis\nVilleneuve at the helm.\nIt is unlikely to be a Best\nPicture contender, but\nmay do well in a number\nof the technical catego-ries, and Roger Deakins\nis the favourite to win\nBest Cinematography for\nthe first time, at a 14th\nattempt. Some consider\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\nas a possibility, considering Rian Johnson\u2019s\nevidently greater skill\nlevel in comparison with\nhis peers who are also\ndirecting new films in\nthe Star Wars franchise.\nIncidentally Johnson has\njust agreed to launch an\nentirely new Star Wars\ntrilogy for Disney, signalling just how highly they\nrate the Looper director.\nNew distributor A24\nhad huge success last\nyear, and while their\nefforts will be focused\non a couple of their other\nreleases, The Disaster\nArtist could see a Best\nAdapted Screenplay nod,\nor director James Franco\ncould score a second\nBest Actor nomination.\nAmazon have teamed\nup with Todd Haynes,\nwhose last film Carol\nmysteriously received\nsix Oscar nominations\nwithout one for Best\nPicture. He returns with\nWonderstruck, another\nof the period pieces he\nexcels with, intertwining\ntwo narratives from 1927\nand 1977 respectively. It\nhas reviewed well, but\nnot quite to the extent of\nhis previous masterpieces\nCarol and Far from\nHeaven. Margot Robbie\nstars and produces I,\nTonya, a biopic about\nnotorious figure skating\nbad girl Tonya Harding.\nRegarded as a sort of\nGoodfellas on ice, the picture\u2019s best hopes hang on\nRobbie for Best Actress.\nRookie company Neon\nare distributing, and it\nremains to be seen if they\ncan have a major impact\nwith so little experience,\nin the way A24 did.\nOthers wearing new\nhats like Robbie include\nAaron Sorkin and Andy\nSerkis. Sorkin is one of\nthe most famous screenwriters in the industry, and\nwhile his directorial debut\nMolly\u2019s Game is a solid\nattempt, it lacks the guile\nthat the likes of Danny\nBoyle and in particular\nDavid Fincher have been\nable to give his written\nmaterial in the past.\nSerkis is best known for\nhis motion capture performances in big franchise\nfilms, include The Lord of\nthe Rings, Star Wars, and\nPlanet of the Apes. His\nfirst time in the director\u2019s\nchair, Breathe, sees him\nbring the biographical\nstory of a man paralysed\nfrom the neck down by\npolio at the age of 28 to\nthe big screen. It is tender\nbut unremarkable.\nHusband and wife team\nJonathan Dayton and\nValerie Faris were unable\nto recapture the magic\nof their wonderful debut\nLittle Miss Sunshine with\ntheir sophomore effort\nRuby Sparks. Their third\nfilm, Battle of the Sexes,\nis good but not great.\nEmma Stone, in the lead\nas Billie Jean King, is\nunlikely to retain her\nBest Actress crown. Scott\nCooper helped land Jeff\nBridges a long overdue\nBest Actor Oscar in 2009\nwith Crazy Heart, and\nwill be hoping to do the\nsame for Christian Bale\nin violent Western thriller\nHostiles. It has been a box\noffice phenomenon, but\nsurely not enough to force\nthe hand of the Academy.\nWarner are running a full\nawards campaign, but bar\nSophia Lillis, who may\nbe able to sneak in a best\nsupporting actress nod, it\nseems unlikely this will\nstick.\nWe will be concluding\nthe predictions for this\nyear\u2019s awards season in\nnext week\u2019s Felix \u2013 keep\nan eye out!\nBlade Runner 2049 and Wonderstruck could possibly strike out at the Oscars this year // Warner Bros./Amazon\nto be focusing its attention\non other projects that are\neasier to sell to voters.\nThe Hollywood sexual\nharassment and assault\nscandals may have had\na knock-on effect on\nawards season. The\nWeinstein Company\u2019s The\nCurrent War opened to\ndismal reviews at Toronto\nanyway, and has since\nbeen pushed to 2018 (if\nTWC survives that long).\nHarvey Weinstein, among\nhis many heinous crimes,\nwas a bully, capable of\nforcing his pictures down\nthe throats of Academy\nvoters. In his heyday,\nTWC scored back to back\nbest picture wins for The\nKing\u2019s Speech and The\nArtist (both undeserv-ingly), and many will be\nglad to rid of him. Ridley\nScott\u2019s second film of the\nyear, All the Money in the\nWorld, is still aiming for\n\n"

And,\nso far, it\u2019s been mixed.\nGizz explores interesting\ncorners of music on each\nwork - Flying Microtonal\nBanana fooled around\nwith notes outside the\nchromatic scale, Murder\nof the Universe was a\nmulti-narrative concept\nalbum, and Sketches of\nBrunswick East turned\ninto a jazz-influenced\neffort (c.f. Miles Davis\u2019s\nSketches of Spain).\nAll of this undoubtably\nwill pay off eventually,\nin the sense that King\nGizzard has displayed\ncross-style proficiency.\nThey\u2019ve seriously\nenhanced their musical\npalette in the brief time\nsince Nonagon, and I\u2019m\npsyched for what\u2019s in\nstore two or three years\ndown the line. In the\nmeantime, though, this\nfeels like lots of diddly\nexperimentation, rushed\nout of the studio maybe\njust a bit too prematurely.\nThe problem is that releasing albums one-after-the-other like this doesn\u2019t\nleave a lot of time for\npolish. The albums feel\ninchoate and occasionally uninspired. Though\nthey\u2019re writing some of\ntheir best music right now,\nthe lines don\u2019t really come\ntogether in the refined way\nyou\u2019d expect from a band\nof King Gizz\u2019s stature.\nThere are rough edges,\nand the past albums this\nyear completely lack\nthe magnetic pull that\ngraces their earlier efforts.\nSketches might be jazz-in-fluenced, but it ends at a\nswing drumline and the\noccasional brass work; it\u2019s\nnot like they\u2019ve gone and\nlearned jazz harmony in\nthe few months since their\nlast album. They\u2019re still\nvery much King Gizz, but\nit falls flat, like they\u2019ve\nrun out of gas.\nAnd that\u2019s near\nwhere we\u2019re left with\nP o l y g o n d w a n a l a n d .\nOn the one hand, this\nis quite an addition to\ntheir ouevre - there are\nfantastically atmospheric\nvocal harmonies (Stu\u2019s\nbeen practicing) and\nwonderful electronic\ntextures on this album.\nGizz also shows off some\nmad rhythm, weaving in\nand out of uncommon\ntime signatures from bar\nto bar with the agility of\na proper djent band. Cop\nthe 7/4:4/4 polyrhythmic\nsynth line on \u2018Desert\nDunes Welcome Weary\nFeet\u2019 (thanks for working\nthat one out, Pearson <3)\nand tell me that\u2019s not real\ntalent. It\u2019s hard to pick one\nof many examples of this\nsort of proficiency, but\nthe subtlety with which\nit\u2019s performed is frankly\njaw-dropping, and it\u2019s all\nover the place here.\nBut that\u2019s partly the\nproblem with this album\n- this feels in many places\nmore like an extended\npoly experiment.The band\nplays tightly throughout,\nbut I\u2019d like more melodic\ninterplay than what\u2019s currently on offer. And while\nthe amped-up blast-your-face-off performances\nthat define Gizz have\nbeen on show moreso\non this album than any\nof the others this year,\nit still feels like they\u2019re\nmissing that magic Gizz\nspark, something that\ncomes only after months\nand months of refining\nthe tunes. The album has\na lingering feeling of\nbeing rushed, recorded\nand mastered with more\nattention to deadlines than\nthe quality of the work\nitself. It\u2019s a good album,\nbut it\u2019s not up to King\nGizz\u2019s snuff.\nStill, I find this the most\nlistenable and appealing\nalbum they\u2019ve put out this\nyear. For a free download,\nyou can\u2019t do much better.\nCory Henry brought the funk back to London last week\nH\nosted at\nKOKO, the\nvenue\u2019s atmosphere was\nperpendicular to that of\nthe typical Friday night.\nAn empty smoking area\nand non-sticky floors\npaid tribute to the\nmulti-layered theater\nenvironment as an\nideal place to host a gig\n(though drinks prices\nwere unfortunately the\nsame as any regular\nSaturday, without the\nbulk deals.)\nThe support act\nXamVolo set the scene\nwith an ambient bass-filled set, mixed with\ngroove and soul, with\nvery clear influence from\nartists such as Anderson\n.Paak and Shaun Martin.\nTheir sound was filled out\nby backing tracks recreating the heavily mixed,\nsub-octave tracks in a\nlive performance. The set\nclosed with \u2018Old Soul\u2019, a\nsong which has a lot more\nkick to it when performed\nlive. These guys are definitely worth a listen.\nDuring the interlude,\nthe iconic Hammond\norgan and Leslie speaker\nwere set up right in the\nmiddle before Cory and\nhis funk apostles took to\nthe stage.\nCory, as usual, impressed us all with fantastic solos, trading bars\nseamlessly throughout\nmost songs. The star of\nthe band, however, was\nNick Semrad, the keys\nplayer set up stage left.\nHe pulled out beautiful\nambient keys patches and\nrhythmic synth lines in\nevery song. Unfortunately\nhe wasn\u2019t given his time\nto shine \u2018til near the end of\nthe gig. When his moment\nin the spotlight came,\nCory queued him in for a\nsolo, he began gliding up\nand down his synth, and\nthe crowd went wild. In\nmy controversial opinion\nhe was more impressive\nthan Cory himself (ed:\nhate to music.felix@ic.ac.\nuk). Look out for his name\nin future gigs - you don\u2019t\nwant to miss those chops\nor the fantastic face he\npulls during a pitch bend.\nThe most tight song\nfrom the night was a cover\nof \u2018Stayin\u2019 Alive\u2019 by the\nBee Gees. They took\nlaid-back tune and gave it\n10 tonnes of punch. The\nrhythm section, Taron\nLockett and Sharay Reed,\nlocked into the pocket,\nproviding the backbone\nof the groove for keys\nand guitarist Adam Agati\nto dance around. Cory, as\nusual, threw a lot of heavy\norgan sounds and has the\nvoice to match. Looking\nat some of his earlier live\nperformances, he has not\nusually been one to take\nthe stage with his vocals,\nbut the man has quite\nobviously been practising,\nand the work has definitely paid off.\nOverall, the gig was\nexactly what you\u2019d expect\nfrom a bandleader with\nSnarky Puppy on his\nresume: a metric shit-ton\nof funk laid down by some\nof the greatest musicians\nworking today. Look out\nfor him next time he\u2019s\naround London.\nMUSIC\nJack Pearson\nMusic Writer\nPlease tell me you caught the Noel Fielding reference in the headline // Wikimedia\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nArtist: King Gizzard and\nthe Lizard Wizard.

The age of Giorgio\nMoroder and Italo Disco\n(or as it later became\nknown, disco) are long\ngone, and we have been\nleft with the Crookers\nand Gigi D\u2019Agostino.\nIn short, Italian dance\nmusic is terrible.\nThen came Lorenzo\nSenni. The man coined\nthe term \u201cpointillistic\ntrance\u201d to describe his\nmusic, which consists of\ntrance buildups but with\nno buildups. To quote\nhis SoundCloud page,\nLorenzo is \u201ca sadistic\nscientist that is ripping the\nspinal cord out of trance\nand dangling it in front of\nour eyes.\u201d\nI had my doubts about\nthis. It\u2019s an interesting\nidea, but that\u2019s all \u2013 listening to his Rinse FM mixes\nis not very enjoyable for\nexample, especially if\nyou\u2019re sexually frustrated.\nMy brother used to listen\nto trance and I have a bit\nof a soft spot for it, but\neven I can\u2019t endure two\nhours of very repetitive\nbuildups that go absolutely nowhere.\nAdd that to the fact that\nLorenzoSenniisquitepretentious and I didn\u2019t have\nhigh hopes for this rave.\nAppearing about half an\nhour later, all he did was\npress play on Ableton and\nthen stand there looking\nconceited, his annoying\nmoustache perched on top\nof a mouth pursed into\nwhat was supposed to be\na bassface, but actually\njust looked like a cat\u2019s\nbottom. As he stood there,\ndancing out of time and\nletting his computer do\nall the automation on his\nsynth, I started to get quite\nannoyed.\nAfter 7 minutes, the\nfirst loop (for it was a\nloop, not a song) ended\nand the next one started.\nWhen I said that Lorenzo\nwasn\u2019t for those suffering\nfrom dry spells, that was a\nlie \u2013 the stabs in this tune\nwere bassy enough to rival\nany kickdrum, and people\nwere properly dancing.\nLater in the evening, the\nsynth produced sounds\nso heavy that despite\nearplugs, my ears actually\nhurt from the vibrations,\nsomething I\u2019ve only\nexperienced with Dub\nsoundsystems before.\nBeing liberated from a\nkickdrum meant that the\nstabs and arpeggiated\nsaws carry the rhythm of\nthe track, and I noticed\nthat people were dancing\nalmost as if they were\nhearing grime tracks.\nAt that point, about 15\nminutes in, I really started\nenjoying myself, more\nthan I\u2019ve enjoyed any\nof the DnB nights I\u2019ve\nbeen to recently. And as\nI quite literally got lost\nin a trance, I thought to\nmyself that Lorenzo was\ntrying to tell us something\nimportant through his\nmusic \u2013 that the buildup\nis just as important as the\ndrop, that the best part of a\nproject is doing it and not\nseeing it realised.\nAt this point, after only\n45 minutes, the music\nstopped, and after almost\nan hour of keeping it in I\nwent to relieve myself.\nBowie, Berlin, and battling sobriety\nU\nn o f f i c i a l l y\nd u b b e d\n\u2018the Berlin\nTrilogy\u2019, the\nthree studio albums that\nDavid Bowie produced\nbetween 1977 and 1979\nwere arguably him at his\ncreative peak. With the\nhelp of Brian Eno, Low,\n\u201cHeroes\u201d, and Lodger\nbrought all kinds of\nsonic experimentation,\nfar from the Ziggy-era\nflamboyance and Thin\nWhite Duke stoicism.\nThe name for this set,\nhowever, is misleading;\nnot only was it, for the\nmost part, not even\nrecorded in Berlin, but\nalso the big Bowie umbrella spans far wider\nthan just those three\nalbums.\nThings weren\u2019t looking\nso swell for Bowie in \u201876.\nSure, he\u2019d just released a\ntruly remarkable album\nin Station to Station, but\nhe didn\u2019t even remember\nrecording it. Existing on a\ndiet of solely red peppers,\nmilk and cocaine, he was\nslowly losing his grip on\nreality, and was convinced\nthat Led Zeppelin guitarist\nJimmy Page had placed a\ncurse on him and was\ntrying to steal his semen.\nProbably time to take a\nbreak.\nAnd so he did. Sort\nof. Leaving the toxic LA\nmicrocosm behind, he\nupped sticks and moved\nto Berlin in an effort to\nsober up, taking with him\nhis friend James Osterberg, who was struggling\nwith his own addictions.\nOsterberg, perhaps known\nbetter as Iggy Pop, was\nfresh out of the breakup of\nraucous proto-punk band\nThe Stooges, and looking\nto form a solo career,\nsought Bowie\u2019s help.\nThe first of many\ncollaborative outputs for\nthem was 1977\u2019s The\nIdiot. Though it\u2019s an Iggy\nPop album in name, it\u2019s\nnot unreasonable to say\nthat Bowie was the main\ncreative driving force\nbehind it. A bit rough\naround the edges, the bulk\nof the recording was done\nin Chateau d\u2019Herouville, a\nbig mansion in the middle\nof just about nowhere,\nwith very little in the way\nof proper engineering.\nAs a result, the sound is\ngnarly and raw; Pop\u2019s\ncharacteristic gravelly\nsnarl paired with Carlos\nAlomar\u2019s buzzed guitars\nmakes for something of\nan auditory assault.\nLyrically, the themes\nare dark. From the\nOedipal nightmares of\n\u2018Sister Midnight\u2019 to the\nreflections on overdoses\nin \u2018Dum Dum Boys\u2019,\nPop\u2019s visceral and often\nspontaneous wordplay\ndrench the LP in macabre\nhues. It\u2019s not all doom\nand gloom however, the\nthrobbing \u2018Nightclubbing\u2019\nseeks to bring the sensations of Berlin\u2019s pulsating\nnightlife, and there\u2019s\nliterally a song called\n\u2018Funtime\u2019.\nMusically, clear\ninspiration was taken\nfrom German Electronic\nKrautrockers Kraftwerk,\nwith extended progressive\njams that verge into industrial territory, particularly\nnotable on the sprawling\ncloser \u2018Mass Production\u2019.\nIt served as a litmus test\nfor the desolate soundscapes that were to follow\non Low and \u201cHeroes\u201d.\nBowie even tested the\nwater with \u2018China Girl\u2019,\nwhich he would release\nas a single of his own\nsix years later, though\narguably without the\ndesperation and longing\nthat set it apart in Iggy\u2019s\nversion.\nIt was a vital stepping\nstone for both involved\nartists, but not without\nits own intrinsic artistic\nmerit. The bastard child of\nthe Berlin Trilogy remains\nthe often forgotten jewel,\na rough diamond that,\nwhen polished, sparkles\nas bright as the best of\nthem.\nMUSIC\nSebastian Gonzato\nIC Radio Chair\nAdrian LaMoury\nMusic Editor\nCome for the vibes, stay for the view // Me, Seb G\nMUSIC\nErich Heckel\u2019s Roquairol, 1917 (colourised) // RCA\n\u201cAbout 15\nminutes in, I\nreally started\nenjoying\nmyself, more\nthan I\u2019ve\nenjoyed any of\nthe DnB nights\nI\u2019ve been to\nrecently\u201d\n40 years of Iggy Pop\u2019s The Idiot.\n\n"

Moreover, most of\nthe initial Model 3 batch\nis given to employees -the last people we can\nexpect to complain should\nthe vehicles arrive with\nany production defects.\nConvenient.\nIt\u2019s a rather depressing\npicture brightened only\nby the fact that the few\nModels 3s that do find\ntheir way to reviewers\nare described as worthy\ncompetitors to their\ngas-guzzling German\ncounterparts.

The Roadster\naccelerates faster than any\ncar in production and with\na top speed of 400+ km/h\ncould easily outrun an F1\ncar and be highly competitive among the Indy 500\nfield.

Resident Politics Writer Abhijay\nSood give his verdict on what it means for us.\nT\nhis Wednesday,\nthe Autumn\nBudget was\nd e l i v e r e d\nby the Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, Philip\nHammond. It entails\ndetails about government\nspending and borrowing,\nand related policies, in advance of the next financial\nyear. This sort of thing\nsounds horrendously\ndull, but it\u2019s important\nto appreciate the state\nof the country and what\nthe government\u2019s up to,\nand to treat those making\ndecisions in our names\nwith scepticism.\nSome will welcome\nthis budget, while others\nwill feel it gives cause for\nconcern. In either case,\nthis budget is a symptom\nof the politically and\neconomically precarious\ntimes in which we live:\nthe government can\nneither follow through\nwholeheartedly on its past\n\u201causterity\u201d policies, nor\ncan they completely adopt\nthe positions of their op-ponents, so they\u2019re stuck\nin the middle, with Brexit\nfurther complicating\nthings.\nHousing\nThe Chancellor is\ntaking three main steps to\nalleviate Britain\u2019s \u201cbroken\nhousing market.\u201d These\nare:\n\u2022 An investment\npackage: \u00a344 billion over\nfive years for building\nhomes\n\u2022 A stamp duty tax\ncut: reducing the burden\nfor first time buyers\n\u2022 An increased\nlevy on empty homes:\nallowing local councils to\ncharge double the tax on\nunoccupied properties.\nThese steps are\nwelcome, but fall short\nof addressing the issues\nthat underpin the housing\ncrisis in this country.\nAccording to members\nof his own party, such as\nthe chairman of the Local\nGovernment Association,\nthe investment plans do\nnot adequately involve\nlocal authorities, suggesting it will be difficult to\nmeet the requisite 300,000\nhomes built per year.\nThe other issue with this\ninvestment is that, even\nunder the government\u2019s\noptimistic figures, this\ntarget is not reached\nuntil the middle of the\nnext decade, meaning the\nhousing stock will remain\ninsufficient for years to\ncome.\nRegarding the council\ntax levy, though this may\ngenerate welcome funds\nfor local authorities, it is\nunlikely to disincentivise\nthose who own empty\nlots in major cities (where\nhousing stock is most\nneeded)fromleavingthem\nempty. The tax increase\nhere represents a relatively small proportion of\noverall property tax, and\npales in comparison to the\nproperty values. However,\nin the countryside, where\nproperties are cheaper,\nthis approach could help\nreduce the number of\nempty properties.\nThe stamp duty tax\ncut is interesting, since\nit is likely to affect those\nreading this article. We all\nwelcome a saving of up\nto 5k on first time buying,\nbut the IOBR suggests\nthese changes will merely\nend up reflected in the cost\nof properties, mitigating\nthe positive benefit. The\nhuge deposits required\nto purchase property in\nplaces like London were\nnot addressed.\nThe government is also\nmaking an extra \u00a3125m\navailable for renters in\nareas where rents have\nsharply increased. This is\nwelcome, but again fails\nto address the underlying\nreasons for these issues,\nwhich will continue to\nproliferate until more\ndrastic action is taken.\nHealth & Social Security\nHealthcare and\nsocial security are the\ntwo largest sectors of\ngovernment spending.\nOn the NHS, \u00a310 billion\nhas been pledged for\nfrontline services over\nthis parliament (next\nfive years), while NHS\nEngland will receive \u00a32.8\nbillion over three years.\nThis is less than half the\nmoney requested by the\ndirector of NHS England\nto tackle ever increasing\nwait times and issues of\nunderstaffing (for context,\ntotal healthcare spending\nis ~ \u00a3145 billion). Discussions are currently taking\nplace between the Health\nSecretary Jeremy Hunt\nand nurses unions on the\nissue of nurse pay, which\nhas been stagnant since\nthe Conservatives entered\ngovernment in 2010.\nSocial security was not\ndiscussed at length by the\nmillions more. Opposition\nparties and independent\nresearchers have pointed\nout that many will lose\nout under this system\n(due to caps, floors, and\ntapers) and long wait\ntimes before receiving an\ninitial payment could be\nextremely damaging to\nthose living paycheck to\npaycheck\u2013pushingpeople\ninto poverty. Former Conservative Prime Minister\nJohn Major described\nthe rollout as \u201cunfair and\nunforgiving,\u201d but the\nChancellor has rejected\ncalls to \u201cpause and fix the\nprogram\u201d. Maximum wait\ntimes have been reduced\nfrom six to five weeks, and\nthough this may pacify\nmoderate Conservative\nsceptics of the policy, it\ndoes nothing to address\nthe other concerns raised\nby its implementation.\nEducation & Research\nThe budget did not\ndiscuss very granular education issues, though its\nannouncements were still\ninteresting and relevant\nto students at institutions\nlike ours. It included a\nheavy focus on maths and\ncomputing, with additional staff to be brought\nin for both, schools\nencouraged to enrol more\nstudents on A-level maths\ncourses, and an expansion\nof a \u201cSingaporean-style\u201d\nmaths education at\nprimary level. In addressing the numeracy gap\nbetween British citizens\nand those of other nations\nit is important that,\nalongside changes like\nthese, efforts are made to\nchange the culture around\nmathematics and education generally (with more\nautonomy for teachers, for\nexample).\nIncreases in investment\nfor Research & Development are also likely to\nbe welcomed by Imperial\nstudents, though the 2.4%\nspending target on R&D\nby 2027 makes it difficult\nto meet a 3% 2030 target.\nTax credits have been\nincreased (from 11% to\n12%), and total spending\nshould increase by \u00a32.3\nbillion in 2021-22.\nTax & the Environment\nThe recent release of the\nParadise Papers has added\nto pressure on the government on the issue of tax\navoidance (which is legal,\nbut widely interpreted as\nimmoral). In response to\nthis, the budget included\nprovisions to tax profits\nbeing directed overseas\nat a higher rate than the\ncorporation tax, primarily\ntargeting digital companies such as Apple and\nGoogle. This is a welcome\nfirst step to addressing an\nendemic problem: \u00a32.7\nbillion a year is lost to\nlegal tax avoidance.\nThe personal allow-ance, the value below\nwhich no tax is paid, is\nbeing increased. This\nlessens the burden on all\ntaxpayers, although since\nother tax brackets are also\nmoving, and due to complications with respect\nto the aforementioned\nuniversal credit program\n(where beyond a point,\nbenefits are severely\nlimited) high earners are\nthe chief beneficiaries\nof these changes. The\nminimum wage is to be\nincreased in line with recommendations from the\nlow pay commission, but\nincreases to the \u201cNational\n\u201cSocial\nsecurity was\nnot discussed\nat length by\nthe Chancellor,\nbut he did\nmention the\ncontroversial\n\u201cuniversal\ncredit\u201d\nprogramme\u201d\nChancellor, though he\ndid mention the controversial \u201cuniversal credit\u201d\nprogramme, wherein six\nmeans tested benefits are\nbeing rolled into one. This\ncurrently affects 600,000\npeople, but will soon reach\nother policies discussed\npertaining to this area in\nthe budget do not assist\nwith environmental\nproblems, and many do\nthe opposite. Overall\nfuel duties have been\nfrozen, and North Sea oil\nproducers are being given\na tax break. Even the\ndiesel levy conspicuously\nexempts \u201cwhite van men,\u201d\nhighlighting the politically precarious position\nthe government is in (not\nwanting to be perceived as\n\u2018punishing swing voters\u2019),\nand limiting the positive\nimpact these changes\nwill have in terms of both\ncarbon emissions and air\nquality.\nIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\nThere is no sugar-coat-ing this: the economic\noutlook is not good.\nGrowth forecasts \u2013 from\nthe non-partisan \u201cIndependent Office for\nBudget Responsibility\u201d\n(IOBR) \u2013 have been\nrevised down. Since the\nrecession, productivity\ngrowth has been sluggish,\nand accounting for this\nthe IOBR have forecasted slower economic\ngrowth than previously\nanticipated, leaving us\non course for the longest\nfall in living standards\nsince records began.\nEmployment reaching a\nnear historic high is fantastic news (though it isn\u2019t\nzero, as the Chancellor\naccidentally intimated\nearlier this week), but low\nproductivity growth and\nreal terms pay decreases\nlimit the positive impact\nthis may have.\nThe government is also\nstill borrowing more than\nit is spending, to the tune\nof around \u00a340 billion.\nWhile this isn\u2019t a problem\nin itself, it puts the\ngovernment in a difficult\nplace politically. They\nhave repeatedly attacked\nLabour for running\ndeficits in the past, but\nhave been unable to meet\ntheir own targets for\ndeficit elimination since\ntaking office, moving the\ngoalposts from 2015, to\n2017, to 2020 and now\nto the \u201cmid 2020s\u201d. The\nemperor has no clothes,\nand even this last target\nseems unlikely to be met\nin light of Brexit, according to the credit agency,\nMoody\u2019s.\nThe rhetoric the Conservatives have adopted\nsince 2010 on the deficit is\nnotable. While Hammond\nhas softened up a little,\nmaking some sensible\nnoises regarding investments and incentives,\neven he repeatedly put\nforward in his Wednesday\naddress the notion that the\neconomic malaise of the\nlate 2000s was \u201cLabour\u2019s\nGreat Recession\u201d: that\nmishandled public\nfinances, rather than a\nglobal financial crisis, led\nus to the position we\u2019re\nin today. You only have\nto look at the rest of the\nworld to understand why\nthis is not the case.\nThe Chancellor may\njust be playing politics,\nbut \u2018deficit hawk\u2019 rhetoric\nwill not forever play well\nfor the government. It\neither hamstrings their\nability to pursue sensible\nfiscal policy for political\nreasons, or will result in\nan internal or electoral\nbacklash once it becomes\nclear they\u2019re \u201cjust as bad\nas the other lot\u201d on bor-rowing.

It does not\nresemble Osborne\u2019s past\nausterity measures nor\nthe feared \u2018punishment\nbudget\u2019. However, it is\nindicative of a government with little room and\nfew ideas: addressing\nissues around the edges\nwithout the necessary\npolitical capital to affect\nroot causes.

Last\nweek, they took on the\n3rd\nrace of the London\nUniversities and Colleges\nCross-Country League,\nand didn\u2019t fail to impress\nas over 60 runners attended despite the grim drizzle\nand muddy course.\nPrior to the race,\nImperial Women\u2019s A team\nwas in 1st\nposition in the\nleague, with the B team\njust behind in 5th\n. The\nMen\u2019s A team sat in 3rd\nposition right behind UCL\nand the B team in 7th\n.\nHaving left campus\nat 1pm, the team took\nthe tube to Southfields\nand from there walked\nto Wimbledon Common\nwhere the race would\nbegin. As the runners got\nto the start with plenty of\ntime before the beginning\nof the race, they were able\nto familiarise themselves\nwith the course, put their\nface paint on and get their\nquads warmed up.\nThe laps were longer\nthan usual, stretching over\n4.5km long, with some\nrelatively narrow, steep\nand muddy parts within\nthe hilly Wimbledon\nCommon.

Situated in the Arts\nDistrict in Downtown LA,\nthe place offers a perfect\nopportunity to forget\nabout your everyday\nproblems and promises to\nput a smile on your face.\nThe project also prides\nitself on providing many\ncool selfie spots, which is\nindeed a clever trick to attract a younger crowd and\nget them to post photos\nwith relevant hashtags to\ndraw even more visitors.\nFor just under $30,\nthe visitors can enjoy\n13 themed rooms, each\nboasting unique attractions and installations. For\nexample, you can find a\nhuge rainbow and a pot\nof gold that you can jump\ninto. Remember those\nchildhood days, when\njumping into a ball pit was\nall we needed for happi-ness? I bet it would still\nbe fun but doing that as\nan adult might be frowned\nupon. Well, worry not \u2013\nthe Happy Place has no\nage restrictions so you\ncan jump away into a pot\nof soft gold coins and feel\nyoung again.\nAnother attraction\nin the gallery allows\nvisitors to lie in colourful\nconfetti and make confetti\nangels. And how can you\nget upsetti when you\u2019re\nrolling in confetti? Since\nit almost never snows\nin southern California,\nthis also presents a rare\nopportunity for the locals\nto experience the joy of\nmaking snow angels.\nTo add to the happiness,\nthere\u2019s also a glass dome\nwhere you can enjoy a\nconfetti storm.\nThe Happy Place\nwouldn\u2019t be truly happy\nwithout delicious snacks.\nLuckily, the organizers\ngot that covered \u2013 the\nvisitors can enjoy cake\npops, ice cream, and even\nrainbow-coloured grilled\ncheese. What\u2019s more, a\ncouple of 7-foot-tall high\nheels made of M&M\u2019s,\nthough not edible, make\na perfect background for\na squad photo. It\u2019s even\npossible to stand inside\nof them! There\u2019s also a\nkiss-themed room with\nshiny XO-shaped installations and a red lip sofa,\nwhich again seem to be\ntargeted at young people\n\u2013 many will inevitably\npost pictures all over their\nsocial media, blessing the\nproject with even more\npublicity. Similarly, in a\nbright yellow room with\na cosy bathtub and walls\nmade of rubber ducks,\nthere\u2019s nothing you can\ndo but to get into that\nbathtub immediately and\ntake some bomb selfies\nwith the ducks in the\nbackground. You paid for\nthis so might as well.\nBut wait, that\u2019s not all!\nThe gallery also contains a\nroom with the furniture on\nthe ceiling, which creates\nan illusion of you being\nupside-down; the Super\nBloom exhibition, made\nof 15,000 flowers; and\nthe mirror room, which\nallows you to observe\nyourself from many dif-The pop-up became a\nhuge deal even before it\nofficially opened its doors\non20thNovember,andthe\nfirst week\u2019s tickets were\nalready sold out by the\nopening day. It\u2019s scheduled until 7th January\n2018, so if you\u2019re visiting\nCalifornia for the winter\nbreak, you might want to\ncheck it out. Though $30\nisn\u2019t super cheap, there\u2019s\nnothing wrong with\ntreating yourself during\nthe holiday season, especially after a challenging\nterm.\nBut let\u2019s be honest\n\u2013 many of us won\u2019t\nspend our Christmas in\nCalifornia. So can we\nstill experience the Happy\nPlace? It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect that\nbeing called a pop-up it\u2019ll\neventually start popping\nup in other large cities in\nthe United States or even\ninternationally, should the\nproject receive enough\nsuccess and publicity. One\ncan only hope it\u2019ll arrive\nto London sometime,\nthough very many US\nprojects stay within the\ncountry, while the UK\ndoes its own thing. I have\nto admit \u2013 once I saw the\nHappy Place in a vlog\nof a youtuber I follow,\nI immediately wished I\nwas in LA again, which\nI visited 2 months ago. I\ncaught myself thinking\nthat people in the US have\nso many more opportunities and more access to\ncool events/things/etc.,\nwhich may never reach\nEurope. And this made\nme realize how often we\nconcentrate on what we\ndon\u2019t have and how much\nbetter our lives could be,\ninstead of appreciating\nwhat\u2019s already around us.\nAfter all, happiness comes\nfrom within, and we all\nhave the power to create\nour own Happy Place,\nespecially once we realize\nhow much we already\nhave to be grateful for. So\nstay strong and positive\nthroughout the difficult\nstudy period, even with\nthe upcoming exams and\ndeadlines, and don\u2019t let\nanything or anyone mess\nwith your Happy Place!\n\u201cThere\u2019s\nnothing you\ncan do but\nto get into\nthe bathtub\nimmediately\nand take\nsome bomb\nselfies with the\nducks in the\nbackground\u201d\n\u201cSo stay strong\nand positive\nthroughout\nthe difficult\nstudy period,\nand don\u2019t let\nanything or\nanyone mess\nwith your\nHappy Place!\u201d\nEdita Pileckyte\nTravel Editor\nThe upside-down room // Instagram @wearehappyplace\nWish this pot of gold would pay for the tuition // Instagram @wearehappyplace\nferent angles and maybe\neven strike a pose or two\nfor another selfie.

Many\npeople, including myself\n(having lived there for\nthe first year of my life),\nhad stopped wondering\nif this day would ever\ncome until events began\nto rapidly unfold last\nweek. Almost overnight,\nthe Zimbabwean military had put the Mugabe\nfamily under house\narrest, taken control of\nthe state broadcaster and\nof the streets of Harare,\nlimiting access to government buildings. The\nmilitary questionably\nclaimed that this was not\na coup. Following this,\nmassive demonstrations\nencouraged by the army,\nopposition parties and\neven Mugabe\u2019s own\nparty ZANU-PF led to\nMugabe resigning on\nTuesday to prevent him\nfrom being impeached.\nbeingsackedasvice-presi-dent on the 6th November,\na move that was almost\ncertainly orchestrated\nby Mugabe\u2019s incredibly\nunpopular wife, \u201cGucci\u201d\nGrace. Those loyal to and\nhigh up within ZANU-PF\nwho were once Mugabe\u2019s\ncronies now felt betrayed\nby her increasing influence and decided to finally\nintervene. Mugabe is now\n93 so contention for his\nsuccessor has recently\nbeen growing with Mnangagwa \u201cthe Crocodile\u201d\nexpected to take this role,\nhowever Grace Mugabe\u2019s\ndesire to acquire power\nwhen her husband dies\nhas stimulated her to\nsystematically remove\nanyone who is in her way.\nNot only is she hated by\na majority of the country,\nshe is 41 years younger\nthan Mugabe and the view\nthat she didn\u2019t play a part\nin the war for independence is key to why those\nleading the \u2018Coup de\nGrace\u2019 want both of them\nremoved.\nLooking back over\nthe past 37 years of\nZimbabwe as a country, it\nis shocking that Mugabe\nhad been able to abuse\nhis authority which has\nbrought sustained deterioration and inequality to\nwhat was once the breadbasket of Africa for so\nlong. He became leader\nof Zimbabwe as a widely\nsupported liberator when\nthe white minority rule\nof the colonial Republic\nof Rhodesia, Zimbabwe\u2019s\nprevious name, was taken\nover after years of civil\nwar by winning the 1980\nelection. Initially he\nworked towards co-op-eration between former\nwhite oppressors and\nimproving the lives of the\npoorer Africans, allowing\nthe country to prosper.\nThis didn\u2019t last long, as\nafter just a few years he\nused brutal assaults to\ntarget any challenge to\nhis dominance, which was\nfollowed by continued\ncorruption throughout his\nparty. In 1983 Mugabe\nused the notorious Fifth\nBrigade trained by North\nKorea to torture, rape and\nmassacretheNdebeletribe\nwho supported his main\nrival during the election.\nIn 1999 trade unions\nformed an opposition\nwhich included support of\nfarmers originally responsible for the country\u2019s\nearlier success, causing\nhim to allow supposed\nwar veterans and his\nsupporters to seize farms\nand evict the farmers by\nany means. Most people\nare familiar with the hyperinflation that followed\n(500 million% according\nto the IMF) as the country\nlost its income and tried\nto solve the problem\nby printing money. In\n2008 when another party\ndefeated him in elections,\nhis party used violence to\nforce them into submis-sion.\nIt is no surprise then\nthat on the day Mugabe\u2019s\nresignation was an-nounced, the streets of\nZimbabwe were filled\nwith people celebrating\n- but this is dangerously\nmisleading. The take-over\nled by General Chiwenga\nisn\u2019t a revolution - the\nlikes of Mnangagwa who\nwill succeed Mugabe\nwant to keep the country\nin hands of the klepto-cratic elite who aren\u2019t\ninterested in democra-tisation or developing a\nfairer system.

This is crucial if\ngovernment fat-cats want\nto keep control of lucrative resources in farming,\nmining and foreign\ncurrency. Learning from\nthe past, it seems inevitable that while the people\nat the top fight over their\nself-interests, the needs of\npeople are left forgotten\nonce again.\nIt is clear that immense\nreforms and new ideas\nare needed, including\ndismissal of the apparent\ndivine right to lead based\non contribution to the\nwar of independence\nallowing those in power\nto be held accountable\nand those in disagreement\nnot being rejected as\n\u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d.\nThe current opposition to\nZANU-PF is unorganised\nand disjointed, the main\nfigure Morgan Tsvangarai was discredited and\ntaken advantage of after\nbeating Mugabe in the\n2008 elections. There\nare others such as Joice\nMujuru, Simba Makoni\nand Nkosana Moyo\nwho look promising in\nsupporting real change.\nThere is also hope in\nMnangagwa\u2019s future as\nleader despite him being\njust as evil as his former\nmaster; he recognises that\nhelp from international\ndonors and aid as well as\nre-establishing the commercial farmers and using\ntheir skills is required to\nrebuild Zimbabwe from\nits severely bankrupt state.\nNow that Mugabe has\nbeen toppled, the wheel\nis turning, thus making\nit easier for a rotation of\nleaders.

We got onto the\npitch and began the warm\nup with a sense of intensity and hunger. Everyone\nknew what was at stake.\nAs UEL made their way\nout to warm up we did\nnotice that a few of their\nplayers looked older than\nour very own Ifan Dafydd,\nwhich was slightly\nworrying considering he\nhas just started hair loss\ntreatment. However, that\nwas not going to stop us\nfrom giving it our all.\nThe game kicked off\nand both teams began at a\nblistering pace. However,\nIC were playing all of the\nrugby. Had it not been for\na few silly mistakes, along\nwith a few pieces of dirty\nplay on their behalf, we\ncould have put away a fair\nfew tries within the first\nten minutes. Eventually,\ntheir criminal acts began\nto be punished and with\na few beautiful touch\nfinders we managed to\nsecure territory as well as\npossession. We capitalised\non this when, amidst the\nopposition floundering at\nthe ruck (causing absolute\nchaos), George Nicholas\nperfectly read the crowd\ndynamics to pierce the\ncentre of a ruck and\nbarrel over the line. 5-0\nto Imperial. An increasing amount of pressure\nfrom UEL and a lapse in\nconcentration from the\nImperial boys resulted in\nUEL\u2019s forwards bundling\nover the line to score a\ntry, which they converted\nto make it 7-5. Following\na regroup we picked up\nthe quality once again and\nGeorge went over for his\nwe knew that we were\ncapable of getting the win\nand even a bonus point.\nWe continued to play our\ngame, taking the ball up\nthrough the forwards and\nthen giving it to the backs\nto play their expansive\ngame plan. This led to\none of the best tries of\nthe match, that saw the\ncentres and wings connect\nup passing it back and\nforth to beat several of\nthe UEL backs, resulting\nin Sam Joon Won Ha\nrunning it over the line to\nscore his first try. 17-7 to\nImperial. The game began\nto draw to a close as we\npushed for that bonus\npoint. Unfortunately, we\nmanaged to knock-on a\nbreak through that would\nhave got us the point.\nThis led to a final scrum\nfor them on their five\nmetre line. The forwards\ngave their final push of\nthe game and managed\nto win the scrum and the\nball came squirting out of\nthe back.

The median\nincome in the UK is approximately \u00a321,000.\nThese data could be\nexplained by the subjects\non offer at Imperial: graduates of STEM subjects\nsuch as mathematics\nand engineering were\namong the highest paid\nfollowing graduation.\nMedicine and dentistry\nwere the highest paying\ndegrees, on average, with\ngraduates earning an\naverage of \u00a346,700 five\nyears after leaving univer-sity. However, due to the\nlength of such courses,\nthese graduates face high\nstudent debt after they\nleave university: a study\nin the British Medical\nJournal found that, even\nwith high salaries, doctors\nwere unlikely to be able\nto pay off their entire debt\nbefore it was written off.\nSubjects which graduates earned the least\nfollowing graduation\nincluded creative arts and\ndesign, agriculture, and\nmass communications.\nThe study also found\ndifferences between male\nand female graduates, as\nwell as between graduates of different social\nclass: male graduates\nearn more right out of\nuniversity, with salaries\n\u00a31,500 higher than their\nfemale counterparts. This\ngap widens as time goes\non, with the difference\nincreasing to \u00a33,500 five\nyears after graduation.\nThe author of the study\nstated some of this could\nbe explained by subject\nchoice, with female students more likely to pick\ncourses such as creative\narts, which have a lower\nearning potential, while\nadmits roughly twice as\nmany male A-level students as female. However,\nthey concluded that the\ndifference could not be\nexplained away by personal choice.\nStudents from more affluent families also earned\nhigher salaries after\ngraduation, with male\ngraduates from high-in-come households earning\n20% more than peers from\nlower-income households.\nEven between those\nstudying the same subject\nat the same university,\nthere was still a 10% gap\nin earnings. The authors\nof the study said that this\nshowed that \u201cimproving\naccess to university alone\nis not enough to address\nissues of social mobility\u201d.\nImperial graduates among top earners, study finds\n\u201cImperial\ngraduates\nearned on\naverage\n\u00a342,050\nfive years\nafter their\ngraduation\u201d\nthose from LSE.

    "content": "ISSUE 1677\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n23\nNai Palm lights up London with a killer solo set\nF\nor the first time\nLondon had\nHaitus Kyote\u2019s\nlead singer,\nNai Palm, at Koko to\nperform her own solo\nmusic in a night which\ndefined her new direction with music. It was\namazing just to see her\non stage, and to finally\nhear her voice properly;\nshe truly is one of the\nmost impressive singers\naround today.\nEllah May, alongside\nher guitarist, opened\nthe show with a gentle\nperformance of some of\nher originals set to rich,\nchordal riffs from the\nguitar. She had a very soft\nvoice, and sort of sat in\nthe same range as the gui-tarist, which didn\u2019t create\nmuch impact from her\nmelodies. They had some\ncross-rhythms between\nthemselves, but lacked\nimpact without a full band\nbehind, and seemed a bit\nforced at some points.\nNext up was Fehdah,\nan Irish singer with a\nmassive voice and a huge\namount of energy. It was\nher first show in London\nand you could feel her\nexcitement throughout the\nperformance. A lot of her\nsongs had an Irish folk\ninfluence to them in terms\nof harmonies, which she\nadded to with interesting\nrhythms and melodies.\nThe opening acts were\nimpressive, although it\nseemed that they were\ntrying to emulate the\nheadliner\u2019s sound (or at\nleast were heavily inspired\nby it), only adding a few\ninteresting quirks to their\nperformances. It would\u2019ve\nbeen nicer to hear something that complimented\nNai Palm\u2019s sound rather\nthan incorporating it to\nthe point where it\u2019s hard\nto differentiate between\nall three of them. Regardless, the show was\nabsolutely awesome and\nif anything, the opening\nacts made you appreciate\njust how amazing Nai\nPalm actually is.\nAnd any issues with\nthe previous acts went\naway when Nai Palm\ntouched the stage; she\ncame out rocking a sparkling leotard, a cream\nJackson flying V, and a\nvoice that filled the entire\nvenue. What was most\nimpressive and unique to\nthe live performance was\nher control over her voice;\nshe was able to come all\nthe way down to a low\nwhisper then open her\nvoice up all within the\nsame phrase. Definitely\ndifferent from recordings\nand tailored for the stage,\nshe sung with a lot of\npower and dynamics.\nYet, the intricacies of\nher voice were not lost\nthrough the microphone;\nyou could still hear the\nlow, slightly husky tones,\nsounding almost like\ntenor sax at some points.\nAnd the unity between her\nguitar playing and vocals\nwas incredibly tight. At\npoints she tried to get the\naudience to sing along,\nwhich was impossible as\nwe were all in awe, and\nthe moment any number\nof people joined in, she\nwent off on some other\nbeautiful melody which\nshut us right up again.\nThe songs she performed were beautiful.\nIt was a mix of original\npieces and covers, all\ninfused with crazy vocal\nad-libs. My favourite\ncover she sung was of\nJimi Hendrix\u2019s \u2018Have You\nEver Been (To Electric\nLadyland)\u2019, just after\ntelling us that she was\ngoing to perform at his\nhouse the next day. She\nput the song in a different\nperspective, singing it as\nif she was this \u2018electric\nladyland\u2019 and wanted to\nshare herself, making it\nmore sexual than even\nJimi had intended. She\nended with her song\n\u2018Homebody\u2019, this slow,\nmelancholy tune which\nsort of fitted, since\neveryone was sad it was\nabout to be over! The\nopen harmonies matched\nher aching lyrics and\nleft the audience feeling\nempty; an interesting end\nto one of the best singer/\nsongwriter performances I\nhad ever experienced.\nAbdullah Ibrahim\u2019s set to remember: a co-op review\nL\nast Tuesday,\nA b d u l l a h\nIbrahim, the 83\nyear old South\nAfrican father of Cape\nJazz, walked on to the\nRoyal Festival Hall\nstage. He sat in front\nof his piano, placed his\nlong hands on the keys,\nand introduced us to the\nconcert with a medley\nof melodies retracing\nhis work. The attention\nof the audience was\ncaught for the rest of\nthe concert, performed\nwithout any interrup-tion. A certain intimacy\nwas established between\nhim and the audience as\nwe were accompanied\nthrough his life story.\nHe takes influence from\nall over the world, with\nswinging rhythms and\nbluesy melodies mixed in\nwith highlife and church\nharmonies, and straight,\nslightly shuffled drum\npatterns. In particular, he\ntakes a lot of influence\nfrom the jazz of Duke\nEllington and Thelonious\nMonk. The genre is as\ncolourful as the nation\nit comes from, and this\nperformance certainly\nexhibited the essence of\nIbrahim\u2019s music and what\nmakes him so unique.\nThe performance\nhappened as a continuous\nsuccession of tunes that\nmix together and echo\nback to each other, tracing\nback melodies he built up\nthroughout his life. He\nstarted off by playing a\nmedley of pieces on his\nown. Harmonically, he left\nit very open with strong\ndominant chords. The way\nhe went about playing,\nincluding his mannerisms,\nwas quite laid back and\nalmost lethargic. Apart\nfrom a few fast runs, it\nwas mostly sustained\nchords with a light\nmelody to move between\nthem. And what impacted\nthe most was how he so\nconfidently would end on\na completely unresolved\nand dissonant phrase, just\nsitting there as if there\nwas nothing wrong. It is\nwhat makes his music so\nspecial, as this feeling of\nunease will sit with you\nas long as he holds those\nnotes.\nThe band entered very\nsubtly, with a cello and\nflute easing into the piano\nmelody to introduce this\ndark, meditative atmos-phere. When the whole\nband came in, it was\none of the tightest, most\nbeautiful entrances ever. A\nbeautiful palette of sounds\nwere explored with a horn\nsection made of an alto,\ntenor and baritone saxo-phone, a flugelhorn and\na piccolo. The baritone\nadded a percussive sound\nto the horns and where a\ntrumpet would have been\ntoo harsh, the flugelhorn\nfit just right to keep the\nhorn section soft yet\npowerful. The piccolo\n(which the alto doubled\non) contrasted with its\nhigh pitch, flying above\nthe solid bass lines. And\nthe bassist brought a\nhuge amount of life to the\nperformance, with fast\nmoving lines that emphasised the rhythm whilst\nfilling empty spaces. All\nof them approached their\nsolos with a lot of inten-sity, which fitted as they\nwere given a lot of space\nto fill as neither the horns\nor piano played behind\n(for the most part).\nIbrahim left space for\nthe music, creating an\nextremely simple and\npure scene where one\ncould focus all one\u2019s attention on what was being\nplayed. Dissonances and\nunresolved phrases are\nscattered throughout the\ndevelopment of reassuring\nand beautiful melodies,\nprovoking both uneasiness and wonder within\nthe audience.\nIt was great to see how\nIbrahim reacted to his\nband. Most of the gig he\nspent watching his band as\nif in awe of his own work.\nAnd once the concert was\nover, he paraded them\nacross the stage at least\nten times, getting them to\nbow at every stage. You\ncould see his pride in his\nband and rightfully so,\nas the performance was\nspectacular.\nOverall, it was a shiv-er-provoking performance\nwhich left the audience in\na reflective mood.\nMUSIC\nAlex MontgomerieCorcoran\nJazz Man\nMUSIC\nThe tinsel goth aesthetic is perpetually in full force with Nai Palm // Flickr: Sarah\nAlex MontgomerieCorcoran\nJuliette Guilloud\nJazz Aficionados\nIbrahim\u2019s career spans a half century of music // CC\n\n"

The people most\ntargeted are trans feminine\npeople of colour, who are\nlikely to be subject to\nmultiple different layers\nof oppression.\nExclusion, discrim-ination, and lack of\nrepresentation put transgender and gender-variant\npeople at risk every day,\nparticularly trans youth.\nA recent Stonewall\nsurvey shows that nearly\n1 in 10 trans pupils have\nreceived death threats at\nschool, while 84% say\nthey have self-harmed and\n45% have tried to take\ntheir own lives.\nWhat I can tell you\nabout the situation at\nImperial is that this year\nI have already received\nreports of transphobic\nincidents, all of which I\nhave taken very seriously\nand acted on, and of staff\nbeing unable to support\ntrans students and address\nthem using their preferred\npronouns.\nJust last year, a\nnon-binary student was\nreportedly grabbed by\nthe arms in an attempt to\nforcefully eject them from\nthe women\u2019s restroom of\nthe Reynolds Bar.\nAdditionally, students\nwho belong to more than\none minority group are\nthose who are margin-alised the most in the\nImperial community, as\nhighlighted in the gender\nequality report commissioned by College and\nreleased last year.\nIt\u2019s ever so important\nthat we do not just memo-rialise the people we\u2019ve\nalready lost and feel sad\nfor those who face oppression on a daily basis.\nWe should be striving to\nprevent more losses and to\nhelp trans people thrive,\nstarting by educating our-selves. And by \u2018educating\nourselves\u2019 I mean you\nhave to do the work. In\nfact, placing the responsibility to educate on trans\npeople is nothing more\nthan wilful ignorance.\nIt\u2019s fundamental to\nlearn how to use pronouns\ncorrectly and find ways\nto avoid making assumptions about someone\u2019s\ngender identity based on\ntheir gender expression.\nStep two is to start\nlistening. Listen to transgender and gender-variant\npeople and trust what they\nsay about the challenges\nthey have to face every\nday. Do not feel entitled\nto ask personal questions,\nbut listen when trans\npeople have something to\nsay to you.\nOnce you have an understanding of what issues\nare facing the trans com-munity, speaking up on\ntheir behalf, challenging\ntransphobic language or\nbehaviour, and supporting\ncampaigns for equality\nare all wonderful things to\ndo as an ally.\nHowever, no matter\nhow good an ally you\nbecome, we all have a\nresponsibility to keep\nunlearning what we have\nbeen taught for years, we\nhave to keep dismantling\nthe oppression we have\ninternalised.\nToday is a good day to\nstart a continuing action\nthat has the potential to\nsave lives all around you.\nGlossary\nTransgender: umbrella\nterm used to describe\npeople whose gender\nidentity differs from the\nsex they were assigned at\nbirth.\nCisgender: a term used\nto describe people whose\ngender identity matches\nthe sex that they were\nassigned at birth.\nNon-binary: also\ngenderqueer, is a catchall category for gender\nidentities that are not\nexclusively masculine\nor feminine \u2014 identities\nwhich are outside the\ngender binary.\nGender variant: also\ngender nonconforming,\nis used to describe an\nindividual whose gender\nexpression does not match\nmasculine and feminine\ngender norms.\nTransphobia: a range\nof negative attitudes,\nfeelings or actions\ntowards transgender,\nincluding non-binary, or\ngender-variant people.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nM\ny number one priority for\nthis year is to ensure Imperial\nbecomes a more safe,\nwelcoming,andinclusivespace\nfor transgender & gender-variant students.\nIn the last few months I\u2019ve been working\nto secure lasting advances for the Imperial\ntrans community. Action I\u2019m taking includes:\n\u2022 Bringing attention to transgender\nissues in Union Council and in the\nCommunity andWelfare Board (CWB), where\nDepartmental Wellbeing Representatives\nalso sit.\n\u2022 Devising plans with the Union\nPresident and the Deputy President\n(Welfare) to advance LGBT+ inclusivity and\nrepresentation at all levels of the Union.\n\u2022 Lobbying College Estates Facilities\nto label as gender-neutral all single-cubicle\n(accessible) toilets in all buildings.\n\u2022 Reviewing key Union policies to\ninclude non-binary people and proposing\nrelevant changes, which so far have\nsuccessfully been passed by the Community\nand Welfare Board.\n\u2022 Activelyparticipatinginthereviewof\na College\u2019s policy draft aimed at supporting\ntransgender students.\n\u2022 Taking seriously all of your reports\nand bringing up recommendations on\nhow to address these issues to the Officer\nTrustees and the CWB.\nCollecting direct feedback from you\ndirectly on which direction to go. This\nhappened first in an initial focus group\nin July and I\u2019m still regularly asking for\nfeedback and suggestions in Imperial LGBT+\nCommunity (https://fb.com/groups/icu.lgbt).\nAdditionally, I am also researching ways\nto raise awareness about gender identity,\ncorrect use of pronouns, and the meaning\nof inclusivity in the Imperial community.

Starring:\nSarah Gadon; Edward\nHolcroft; Rebecca Liddiard.\nALIAS GRACE\nA\nlias Grace\nis a six-part\nmini-series on\nNetflix. It is\nan adaptation of Margaret\nAtwood\u2019s historical fiction novel about servant\nand convicted murderess,\nGrace Marks, played by\nSarah Gadon. Similar\nto Atwood\u2019s classic The\nHandmaids Tale, Alias\nGrace discusses the op-pressionofwomen.Itisset\nin the 19th century, when\nVictorian women had to\nsuppress parts of their\npersonality considered to\nbe unfitting and vulgar,\nthus allowing Atwood and\nscreenwriter Sarah Polley\nto investigate the multiple\nidentities of women \u2013 the\none shown to the world\nand the one buried within.\nThe gender inequality at\nthat time meant that women\u2019s stories were often lost\nor misconstrued. Alias\nGrace is a scintillating\nseries which unstitches\nthe complex identities of\nVictorian women, and\nprovides a chilling resemblance to the lives of\nwomen today.\nThe ultimate question\nis whether or not Grace\nMarks was a key player\nin the murder of her\nemployer, Thomas\nKinnear, and his mistress,\nNancy Montgomery.\nAudiences grow increasingly curious as the story\nunfolds only to find in the\nend that the answer does\nnot matter. Polley inten-and power of men.\nTold from Grace\u2019s point\nof view, she recounts her\nlife story during interview\nsessions with Dr. Simon\nJordan (Edward Holcroft).\nAs the story unfolds, it is\nclear that her sorrows are\ncaused by men\u2019s dominance and power over sex.\nGrace suffered an abusive\nrelationship by her father.\nAfter she escapes to\nbecome a servant, she\nforms a close relationship\nwith a fellow maid, Mary\nWhitney whom she finds\nlove and comfort in. That\nfriendship is taken away\nwhen Mary is impregnated by the son of the house.\nA sexual relationship\nwith men at the time was\nintolerable and a fireable\noffense \u2013 after he refuses\nto marry her, Mary has no\nchoice but to get an unsafe\nabortion in secret, which\nkills her. Finally, once\nGrace moved to become\na servant for Mr. Kinnear,\nhis housekeeper \u2013 Nancy\n\u2013 who also happens to be\nhis mistress, formed an\nunwarranted jealousy and\ndislike towards Grace,\nwhich led to her further\nmistreatment and unhap-piness.\nUnlike her \u201cgood girl\u201d\nidentity which she shows\nto the world, one of\nGrace\u2019s personalities is the\nvivacious, sexual Mary\nWhitney. These female\ncharacters represent the\ntwo antithetical identities\nwomen could have \u2013 a\nvirtuous maiden or a\nwhore. Emerging as Mary,\nGrace has the freedom to\nbe sexual and expressive.\nWhether Mary was real\nor just a character created\nby Grace to unravel this\nside of her multifaceted\nidentity remains unclear.\nThis depiction of Victorian women contrasts with\nhistorical descriptions of\nwomen of the time as \u201cfair\nmaidens in white frocks\u201d\nabsent of any sexual\ndesires.\nQuilting is used as a\nmetaphor throughout the\nstory as Grace can be\nseen stitching in every\ninterview session with\nDr. Jordan.

Furthermore, it\nrepresents female labour\nand domesticity, with the\nonly outlet women having\nto express their creativity\nbeing through domestic\nobjects.\nAlias Grace is significant in a time when\n\u201cwomen\u2019s rights are\nincredibly precarious\nand fragile\u201d, says Polley.\nIssues relating to reproductive rights, sexual\nabuse, and victim blaming\nare as pertinent now as\nthey were 150 years ago.\ncoming forward accusing\nother powerful men in\nHollywood, proving that\nsexual abuse is endemic\nin the film industry. \u201cI\u2019ve\ngrown up in this industry,\nsurrounded by predatory\nbehaviour, and the idea\nof making people care\nabout it seemed as distant\nan ambition as pulling the\nsun out of the sky\u201d, wrote\nPolley. The stories of\nthese courageous women\nare chillingly similar to\nthose in Alias Grace.\nUnder the Trump pres-idency, women\u2019s rights\nseem to have been set\nback decades.

However, the IWGB\nargues this breaches\narticle 11 of the European\nConvention on Human\nRights, which gives\nworkers the right to join\na trade union in order to\nprotect their interests.\nThe IWGB aims to establish that the University\nof London is the de facto\njoint employer of the\nstaff, along with Cordant\nSecurity, which would\ngive them the same employment rights as those\ndirectly employed by\nthe University.

The pe-tition, which was started\njust over a week ago, asks\nAlice Gast, President of\nImperial, to expand the\ngym into the waiting area\non the ground floor.\nThe petition has\nattracted a number of supportive comments from\nstudents. One student,\nwho completed their\nundergraduate degree\nat Imperial, said that\nthey had stopped going\nbecause it was \u201cfar too\nsmall for the number of\npeople it serves\u201d.

He added:\n\u201cThe more people I talk\nto, the more I find that\nmost people think along\nthe same lines.

Imperial White\nteam (consisting of helms\nAidan Bell, Toby Freeland\nand Oliver Kidd and crews\nMichal Wojnowski, Mary\nChapman and Ariane\nDe Saint Victor) got off\nto a rusty start having\nnever trained together as\na team and experiencing\nseveral boat breakages.\nHowever, after a couple\nof races we were starting\nto gel together and really\ntook advantage of the\nevent as an opportunity to\npractice the tactical side\nof team racing, executing\nsome great mark traps\nand gybe backs to convert\nteam members through\nand achieving some solid\nwinning combinations.\nMeanwhile the London\nPurple team (consisting\nTaekwon-don\u2019t mess with us\nImperial Taekwondo off to a great year with many wins in the first two competitions of the year!\nSPORTS\nLaura Beseler\nICUTKD Chair\nN\nerves, adrenaline and a lot of\nsweat.

Zone 4 has never\nfelt so far.\nAfter weigh-in, it was\nfinally time for the competition to start: the draws\nwere up. We knew who\nour opponents were going\nto be, how many fights\nstood between us and that\ngold medal. As some of us\nstepped into the ring for\nthe first time, it seemed\nlike the entire team was\nthere with them. Our name\nbounced off the walls,\ninterspersed with \u201cICU \u2013\nTKD\u201d chants. Every kick\nthat landed was greeted\nwith a cheer and when\nsomeone managed to get\npast our defences there\nwas considerable booing.\nAfter 9 hours of com-petition, the Imperial\nCollege London Team\ncame home victorious.\nNot only did we achieve\nfour gold, one silver and\ntwo bronze medals in\nLUSL and seven gold,\nthree silver and four\nbronze in LUSL, but we\nalso placed 2nd\nin the\noverall university ranking,\nbeating teams more than\ntwice our size. Some highlights of the competition\nwere the four gold medals\nwon in both ICO and\nLUSL by our black belts\nconsidered two of the best\nin the country. However,\nthey were not the only\nones with outstanding\nperformances; Menghan\nLiu (two golds), Sharmila\nRana (one gold, one\nsilver) and Cynthia Ho\n(one gold), all at their third\ncompetitions, showed all\nof us that hard-work and\nstrong discipline can take\nyou wherever you dream\nof. Particularly impressive\nwas Emilie Pria, who won\na gold having taken up\nthe sport only six weeks\nago and Sophia Pali, who\nrecently switched from\npoomsae (patterns) to\nsparring (fighting style)\nand obtained one gold and\none bronze.\nICO (Imperial College\nOpen) is an annual student\ncompetition that started\nout at our university in\n2012. Every year the event\nhas grown, attracting more\nand more competitors\nfrom all over the country.\nThis year there were more\nthan 240 students fighting\n(and many more boosting\nmorale from the side-lines), making it one of\nthe biggest and probably\nnoisiest martial arts university competitions in\nthe UK. In fact, the championship has proven to be\nso successful that, starting\nfrom 2017, BSTF (British\nStudent Taekwondo\nFederation) has stepped\nin to organise the event.\nThis ensures ICO will\nreach and accommodate\nfor even greater numbers\nof participants and institu-tions.\nOn the other hand,\nLUSL(London University\nor experience in this dis-cipline.

I have no objection\nto people experiencing\nhappiness, but when that\nhappiness is of a private\nnature and clearly restricted to the blissful pair, I\nwould prefer it if I were\nnot cornered like a rat in\na cage and forced into\nbecoming an unwilling\nthird wheel.\nChristmas does not\ninspire either of these\nforms of hatred within\nme. It is something I am\nresigned to, a holiday\nthat everyone will try\nand make me enjoy and\ninevitably I will not.\nI start hating Christmas early, just as the\nfirst posts from people I\ndespise on social media\nappear, normally of\nthe form \u201conly x many\ndays til\u2019 Christmas\u201d,\nin the middle of July.\nQuite frankly Sharon, I\ndon\u2019t give a fuck. The\nonly reason I haven\u2019t\nunfriended you yet is so\nI can feel smug at the\nshallow and vaccuous\nlife you lead. I harbour\nhatred for the way\nChristmas creeps into\nour shops, like some kind\nof gaudy, glitter covered\nmould. The earliest I\u2019ve\ndiscovered Christmas\nthemed merchandise so\nfar was in August. I do\nnot need reminding that\nthe odious celebration\nhijacked by Christianity\nis on it\u2019s way and will\nsoon be making my life\na living hell. I would\nhave much preferred\nSaturnalia, especially as\na Roman slave.\nChristmas for me,\nindicates the start of\na hectic corporation\ndominated spend-fest,\nwhere the pressure to\npurchase the right gift\nfor the right price is\ncloying and omnipres-ent. Black Friday sales\npiss me off particularly.\nBlack Friday just shows\nyou that companies are\nhappily ripping consumers off for the rest of\nthe year only to get us\nexcited about possible\n\u201csavings\u201d and produce\nsome admittedly hilarious videos of grown\nmen and women fighting\nover a \u00a3200 TV screen.\nSecret Santa is the best\nexample of everything\nwrong with Christmas\nconsumerism: last year\nI received a mug with\nthe handle in the shape\nof an erect penis. Every\ntime I drink from it, the\nbell-end gets alarmingly\nclose to my eye.\nDon\u2019t think that I\nbemoan traditional\nChristmas either. I\ncannot testify as to how\nyou feel about your\nfamilies, but at best I\nexperience apathy, if\nnot downright irritation\nat the prospect of being\nseated around my grand-parents. I don\u2019t want to\nendure the excruciating\ndetails of how to use a\ncolostamy bag and the\nenlightening chat you\nhad with Maureen about\npainting watercolours\nof horses. Please see\nSharon for my feelings\non both of these topics.\nAs the alcohol begins\nto flow, people\u2019s tongues\nloosen and slowly but\nsurely, the converation\nslips from a fragile peace\nto violent all out war.\nAccusations are thrown\ntoo and fro, sowing the\nseeds for further recriminations for the future,\nbefore the bloodied\nparties have retreated to\nlick their wounds. Once\nDoggo doin a heckin nappo bappo// Flickr/normanack\nevening arrives a false\nreconciliation occurs, as\nthey once again cover\ntheir true feelings with\na veneer of politeness.\nThis experience of\nChristmas is probably\nwhy I approach it with\nsuch trepidation, bordering anxiety. This makes\nChristmas shit.\nI blame the illusion\nof Christmas joy on\nChristmas films. All\nof them are forced\nattempts at humour and/\nor an attempt to extract\nsome form of emotion\nfrom us. I haven\u2019t been\nable to watch Home\nAlone without seeing\nthe ghost of heroin-ad-diction future, and Love\nActually is pretty rapey.\nDie Hard is an excep-tion. Everything else\nChristmassy is shit.\nL\net\u2019s assume\nyour claim that\nexercise being\ngood for mental\nhealth is true, and that it\nis Imperial\u2019s duty to deal\nwith this problem.\nOk. So Imperial\nneeds to get more people\nto exercise. Anyone who\nhas been to the gym at\nEthos knows that at least\n50% of the treadmills\nare being walked on,\nand at least one of the\nrowing machines is\nbeing used by someone\nmoving the seat up and\ndown under him/herself\nwhile somehow keeping\nthe handle in exactly the\nsame place, putting precisely 0.2 calories per\nhour of power through\nthe fan. The point is,\nthere is absolutely no\nneed to increase the\nsize of the gym. People\nare perfectly capable of\nwalking all of 100m to\nHyde Park for a jog, or\neven joining the cross\ncountry club if they feel\nunable to run unsuper-vised. Indeed, I would\nparticularly recommend\nthat last one. The club is\nthe largest sports team at\nImperial and has a great\nsocial scene.\nWe have to, of course,\nspare a thought for the\nminority who actually\nuse the gym in a mildly\nwise manner. Perhaps\nthere should be a\ntreadmill walking ban,\nEthos Gym does not need to expand.\nAn anonymous writer argues that the gym is more than big enough, people just need to use it\nproperly.\nor even the removal of\nhalf the treadmills to\nmake way for actually\nuseful gym equipment.\nAdditionally, students\nmight be interested to\nknow that Reynolds\ngym is also available to\nstudents to use, although\nthey may have to interact\nwith the outside world\non the way there.\nIf you really want\nto spend some of the\nmoney Imperial has,\nmay I suggest investing\nit in some more scholarships for extremely\ntalented students. After\nall, this is a university.\nCOMMENT\nAnonymous\nComment Writer\n\u201cPerhaps\nthere should\nbe a treadmill\nwalking ban\u201d\n\n"
