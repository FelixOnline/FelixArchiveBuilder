    "content": "A great scientist\n400 years later, and Galileo\u2019s choices are still relevant to us all\nIf anyone fits the definition of gen-ius, it has to be Galileo: mathema-tician, physicist, and inventor. By\ndeveloping the telescope, he made\nimportant observations that allowed him to challenge ancient\ncosmology and the prevailing view\nof mankind\u2019s place in the Universe.\nBut The Life of Galileo is more than\nthe story of a great scientist: it is a\npolitical work meant to provoke as\nwell as to entertain.\nBrecht uses Galileo\u2019s life as the\nskeleton upon which to hang the\nflesh of a fictional narrative dealing\nwith timeless themes: science versus religion, reason versus dogma,\nhumanity versus authority.\nThe drama lies in Galileo\u2019s\ndogged pursuit of what he sees as\nthe truth, wherever it may take\nus. This threatens both religious\ndogma and the stability of the old\norder, and brings him into conflict\nwith the Church.\nGalileo is no superhuman, though.\nHe is portrayed instead as a man\nin the raw: flawed, obsessive, iras-cible, and reckless. His reactions\nare as much visceral as cerebral,\nhis pleasures alimentary as well as\nastronomical. While he can understand the meaning of his discover-ies, is he also a man enough to face\ntheir consequences?\nWe learn in a cliffhanger scene\nof high tension that Galileo\u2019s religious and dutiful daughter wishes\nher father to recant his heresies\nand be spared torture at the hands\nof the Inquisition. His loyal supporters want Galileo to stick to his\nbeliefs and stand up for the truth\nregardless. What does he choose?\nWhat are his motives? What are the\nconsequences?\nBrecht asks questions of us.\nShould science be pursued for its\nown sake? Should scientists be\nresponsible to society for their ac-tions? Should political expediency\nor religious fundamentalism be allowed to suppress the truth? We\nare left to ponder the answers and\nto find our own position in current\ndebates about cloning, creationism,\nand climate change.\nDavid Hare\u2019s fine adaptation\nfeatures the typically assured and\nenergetic Simon Russell Beale\nmaking the best of the title role.\nThe supporting cast is also excellent and some of the most powerful\nspeeches come from the Cardinal\nInquisitor, the Donald Rumsfeld\nfigure of his era \u2013 a cold, calculating\ncharacter with little interest in the\nniceties of arithmetic.\nAppropriately, the actors travel\ntogether on the revolving stage\nduring frequent scene changes,\nneatly reminding us that, in riding\nthe whirling roundabout of human\naffairs, we are all as one on our\nspinning Earth.\nThe Life of Galileo runs until\nthe end of October. The remaining\nperformances are pretty well sold\nout so you will need to be lucky, or\nclever, to get hold of tickets.\nEdward Wawrzynczak\nThe Life of Galileo\nNational Theatre\nUntil October 31st\nFrom \u00a310\nBeer Guru\u2019s Guide\n\u201cEnlightenment for those who\nthirst for knowledge,\u201d says the\nfront cover.

However, if you are\nreading this, you are probably\nmore than well aware of what a\nmarvellous substance it really is.\nIt is said that alcohol is probably\nresponsible for many of the socalled magic potions and witch-doctory of the past \u2013 who can\nhonestly say that they have not\nfelt like Superman after a night\non the booze? This book explains\nin a light-hearted way about how\nbeer is truly a sacred beverage,\nto be appreciated by all, and not\nto be ruined by cheaply made, regionally licensed lager.\nThe Beer Guru, demi-god who\nresides high in the Himalayas,\ntakes you through how to fully ap-The Beer Guru\u2019s Guide\nBook Review\nby C.

This book is amusing\nin a not-too-sophisticated way:\nyou could read out a couple of\nlines with your mates and have a\nlaugh at it.\nHaving said all this, the book is\nnot really the sort of book you can\nactually sit down and read. It is\nthe kind of book that you buy your\nDad on Fathers Day, because you\ncannot think of a proper gift to\nget him.\nIt is funny in its own way, but\nI did not find it as good as some\nof the many other beer guides on\nthe market. It reads as if it was\nwritten between the cast of Men\nBehaving Badly crossed with the\nDalai Lama, and paying \u00a310 for a\nbook which is essentially nothing\nmore than a bit of humour seems\na bit steep.

These are usually split\ninto two halves, with the swimmers\nin the first session, and the water-polo players in the second session.\nThe trouble started when the first\nsession overran. A member of the\nclub, Ares Protopapas, became\nirate at the external coaches at\nthe poolside, asking them to hurry\nup and clear the pool. The coaches\nwere in the process of concluding\nthe session, but this apparently was\nnot enough for Mr Protopapas, who\ndisrupted the end of the session\nand jumped in the pool.\nAfter the event, the club\u2019s President, Sophie Mitchinson, sent an\nemail to the club\u2019s mailing list.\nThe email asked members to try\nto be punctual to training sessions\nto prevent overrun, to stay out of\nthe pool until a coach has checked\nwhether the trainee is a club mem-ber, and to wait patiently should\nthe first session overrun. Mr Protopapas decided that this was not\nsufficient, and sent an email to the\nentire list, as well as the Rector, Sir\nRichard Sykes. The email, entitled\nsomewhat bizarrely, \u201cof timekeep-ing, sportsmanship and tobacco\u201d,\naccused the swimmers of monopo-lising the pool and not taking into\naccount the fact that \u201csome of us\nhave various professional and other\nobligations\u201d.\nIt also included a rather strange\npersonal attack against the coaches themselves, stating: \u201cI personally find the presence of \u2018civilian\u2019\npersons (business managers etc\nin mufti [civilian dress], without\nappropriate ID, uniform, or good\nmanners and reeking of tobacco\nsmoke) rather inappropriate for the\nEthos poolside.\u201d Mr Protopapas\u2019\ncomplaint seems to be that he felt\nhe had been treated badly by the\ncoaches, and that wearing \u201cIC colours/trunks\u201d should have entitled\nhim to preferential treatment.\nMr Protopapas should not have\nbeen able to join the club, as he is\nno longer a student at the College,\nand hence no longer a Union mem-ber. He was able to join via the website due to an administrative error\nby ICT, which still had his status set\nas a current student. He has since,\nallegedly, claimed life membership\nof the Union; however, no records of\nthis exist.\nIn an email leaked to Felix by\nan anonymous source, Neil Mosley, head of Sport Imperial, stated\nthat Mr Protopapas must abide by\nEthos\u2019 codes of practice, or he will\nbe banned from using the centre.\nGrant Deskine, operations manager for Sport and Leisure, stated\nthat the partnership with Fast Fins\nto provide additional coaching at no\nextra cost has been \u201cvery impressive\u201d. He also stated that he \u201cdoes\nnot feel one \u2018minor\u2019 issue should\nbe blown out of all proportion by an\nindividual who is not even a member of the student body\u201d, confirming that the Rector\u2019s office has also\ncome to this conclusion.\nFelix attempted to contact Mr\nProtopapas for comment; no reply\nwas forthcoming at the time of going to press.\nA pool session at Ethos was disrupted by an unruly ex-student\nElections much\nless of a farce now\nAndy Sykes\nThe Council elections have become\nless farcical, with the Union President, John Collins, changing the\nrules to allow people to stand.\nThe GSA elections did have all\nsigns of becoming a classic Union\nelection farce, but a number of people are now standing for the available posts after a heavy campaign\nof e-mailing and approaching post-graduates. However, the seconding appeared to be a problem, with\nmany candidates having only one\nor two seconders. Mr Collins decided to interpret the constitution regarding elections, which says that\ncandidates \u201cnormally require\u201d ten\nseconders in order to stand, and\n\u2018waved through\u2019 those who had a\nfew seconders.\nHowever, hustings still appeared\nto be as pointless as ever, despite\nthe enthuisiasm of Mr Collins,\nwhich a few students lunching quietly in the JCR found somewhat off-putting if the heckles are to be be-lieved. The candidates for the GSA\ncan only be voted for by postgradu-ates, and several students then\nraised the question of why hustings\nfor these positions took place in the\nJCR instead of the SCR. Mr Collins\nresponded that masters\u2019 students\nare not permitted in the SCR, but\nare still represented by the GSA.\nThe RON campaign, run by\nStephen Brown (RAG Chair) this\nyear, got a far better reception than\nany of the other candidates, with\nsome responses to questions making the whole room chuckle. When\ndiscussing the Equal Opportunities\nOfficer post, Mr Brown said: \u201cI\u2019d rename it Athletics Union Officer.\u201d\nCorrections and clarifications\nIn issue 1359, we included this claim in the front page story about\nthe incident at Wye Campus: \u201cConcerns have also been raised over\nthe fact that students were still being served in the bar, despite being clearly drunk.\u201d We have since learned that this is incorrect; the\nstudent in question arrived at the bar drunk already, and was rightly\nrefused service by the bar staff. We sincerely apologise for this\ninaccuracy.\nStephen Brown, standing as RON, amuses the voting public\nWining, dining, maxing, and relaxing at the RCSU and CGCU balls.\nPAGES 10 AND 11\n\n"

    "content": "Back in 2003, Amy Winehouse crept\nonto the scene with her critically-acclaimed debut album Frank, but\nthe world wasn\u2019t listening. Nominations for a Mercury and Brit award\nfinally had copies flying off the\nshelves and it went on to be certified multi-platinum.\nFast-forward three years and\nshe's back, a couple of pounds lighter but her voice is just as full-bodied\nand husky as it has ever been.\nRehab, the first single off the al-bum, sees the Londoner ditching\nher signature jazzy roots characterized by the complex chord structures in favour of a simpler and\nsoulful gospel sound.\nIt is just the right amount of\nquirky and maybe that\u2019s why she\nwill remind some of Macy Gray\n(without the homicidal tendencies).\nRehab is unlikely to grace the top of\nthe charts anytime soon (although\nit thoroughly deserves to) but it\ndoes prove that urban British music doesn\u2019t have to be childish and\nchavvy. I think a certain Ms. Lily Allen should take note.\nJemil Salami\nA look at the short-length releases\nMcFly\nStar Girl\n(Universal)\nIIIII\nI like to think I have an open mind\nwhen it comes to music \u2013 I even admit to owning Shania Twain CDs.\nHowever I can only assume this\nsong was produced using the following process: Step 1, for inspiration\nwatch Rick Waller have a colosto-my; Step 2, Inspired by the \u2018rich and\npowerful\u2019 aromas write lyrics such\nas \u201cYou never asked me to say ooooo-ooo\u201d; Step 3, after failing to flog\nit to North Korea as a WMD, package it up with cover art designed by\nthe work experience kid and ship it\nout to literally thousands of adoring fans, with a combined age lower\nthan Rick Waller\u2019s weight (in tons).\nIt\u2019s tempting to describe the song\nas a polished turd simply for attempting to rhyme \u2018kissed me\u2019 with\n\u2018frisbee\u2019, however I fear even Mr\nMuscle developed ear cancer after\nlistening to this drivel.\nJohn O\u2019Loughlin\nAmy Winehouse\nRehab\n(Island)\nHHHHI\nRhianna\nWe Ride\n(Def Jam)\nHHHII\nThe Magic Numbers\nTake A Chance\n(EMI/Heavenly)\nHHIII\nThe astounding thing about The\nMagic Numbers, if you ask me, is\nhow on earth they got to be so popu-lar? It really does boggle the mind\nhow they got to become one of the\nmost talked about bands. I might\njust be bitter that they sound almost\nexactly like Belle & Sebastian but\nfar more twee and syrupy, and don't\nshow enough of their pop-like side\nas Belle & Sebastian show. If you\nbought the album on the strength\nof the singles, you will have been\nsuitably annoyed that there were\nno extra pop-tastic indie-folk tunes.\nBut you must at least admit that\nthe singles are surprisingly good.\nTake a Chance has a fun, bouncy\nbeat that is matched by a relentless\nand quite catchy vocal line. This is\nif you can stand Romeo Stodart's\nwhiny, aurally painful singing voice.\nFrankly I can't. It makes me want\nto shoot things. But the music is\nLondon Apartments\nLogistics and Navigation\n(Universal)\nHHHII\nEP review\nThis EP is the first release outside Canada from Justin Langlois\naka The London Apartments and\nthe press release certainly makes\na good go at granting him the all\nimportant indie credibility that\nmay help push him onto the world\nstage; the references to obscure influences are interspersed with the\nheartwarming tale of a teenager\ncreating tracks on his computer\nin his bedroom and getting them\nnoticed with a little bit of help our\ngood friend the internet.\nThen there\u2019s the ridiculous name.\nI can almost imagine the thought\nprocess that brought it about, \u2018A\npluralised name for my one-man-band? Why not? It worked for\nBright Eyes.\u2019 So far so indie. It\ncould only be better if Justin wasn\u2019t\nfrom Ontario because everyone\nknows all the cool kids are from\nMontreal (Godspeed You! Black\nEmperor and The Arcade Fire to\nname a couple).\nOnce I got bored with the self\npromotion I figured I should probably get around to listening to the\nCD and I must admit it\u2019s a polished\npiece of work.\nBreathy and somewhat ethereal\nvocals float on top of an electronic\nback-drop of bleeps and beats. It\nmakes strangely hypnotic listen-ing. I think the most obvious comparison is to Icelandic band Sigur\nRos.\nThe similarity between the otherworldly vocals both employ is quite\nstriking. Also their lyrics share the\nsame unintelligble quality, although\nin the case of the Icelandics this\nmay be achieved by singing mainly\nin a fictional language.\nWhere the differences really start\nis with the range of sonic palette\nboth artists can employ. Whilst Sigur Ros always have a trick up their\nsleeve, be it a guitar played with a\ncello bow or the ever-present threat\nof the brass section, this record is\nmuch more limited.\nNo matter how varied the electronic backing is there is a tendency\nfor it all to blend into one giving the\nimpression of an EP with one exceptionally long track rather than\nfour shorter ones. Whether this is\ngood thing or not I would imagine\ndepends very much on whether one\nis trying to get to sleep at the time\nor not.\nThis sounds far harsher than I\nintend to be. This is certainly an accomplished debut and I did enjoy it.\nIt is definitely worth a listen if you\nenjoy the kind of ambient, vocal-driven sound it employs.\nHowever it seems limited in\nscope \u2013 there\u2019s only so much you\ncan do with drum machines and\nsynthesiser software and this\nrecord seems to hit that wall.\nThat being said I do hope to here\nmore from Justin Langlois, if he\ncan achieve something like this\nwith just his computer then I\u2019d love\nto hear what he could do leading\nthe band implied by the name he\nhas chosen for his project.\nSo look out for this guy in the future I'm sure we\u2019ll be hearing from\nhim again, I just hope it's not in the\nform of backing music for a car\nadvert.\nThomas Wilkins\nFinally, this week\u2019s singles round-up\nSean Lennon\nDead Meat\n(Capitol)\nHHHII\nplace accompanying the dramatic\norchestral backing.\nYou can really hear his anguish\nover the subject matter, his recent\nending of a long-term relationship.\nWhilst he doesn\u2019t express the emotion lyrically, the melodramatic\nmood of the song conveys this per-fectly. A guitar carrying the clever\nchord progression strums in the\nbackground and a piano adds little frills around the edges, but all-in-all this sound is nothing ground\nbreaking.\nOverall, Sean Lennon is worth\nchecking out if you\u2019re a fan of the\ncurrent indie-with-strings trend. If\nnot, go and buy yourself Sergeant\nPeppers\u2019 and hear what real music\nsounds like.\nFrancesco Padormo\nPoor Sean Lennon; no matter what\nhe does, he\u2019ll always be compared\nto his father. It\u2019s inevitable. What\nmakes it worse is that he also looks\nand sings like him. Even though I\nacknowledge his misfortune, I can\u2019t\nhelp but fall into the same trap.\nWhile I\u2019m listening to the song,\nthoughts of how John would\nimprove the song niggle at\nthe back of my head. I feel\nterribly guilty, because\nin essence this is a\ngood song.\nLennon\u2019s vocals initially\nsound weak,\nbut soon\nfind\ntheir\nRihanna is 3 singles into a moderately good sophomore effort and\nit's beginning to show. It's not that\nwe're tired of seeing the Barbados\nbeauty writhe around on a beautiful\nbeach (we can\u2019t get enough of that)\nbut the single quality has dropped.\nWe Ride sounds at home on the\nalbum but isn't really strong enough\nto go it alone.\nS.O.S (Rescue Me) turned out to\nbe the heavy-hitting club stomper\nand Unfaithful fulfilled its objective\nas the pretty, intricately-crafted yet\nmature ballad (with a very clever\nuse of murder as a metaphor for\ncheating) and this all makes We\nRide seem, well, pretty boring.\nLet\u2019s put it this way, it\u2019s the not-so-attractive one nobody wants but the\nguy with a girlfriend ends up pairing off with as a favour or good deed\nto his mates. Definitely second rate\ncompared to its predecessors but\nseeing as the chart is a bit barren\nat the moment it won\u2019t have much\ntrouble climbing to a respectable\ntop 15 position.\nJemil Salami\nKelis ft. Nas\nBlindfold Me\n(La Face)\nHHHHI\nIn late 2003, Kelis joined forces with\nher then fianc\u00e9, Nas, and blessed\nus with the wickedly sexy groove\nthat is In Public.\nKelis rarely ever repeats a trick,\nbut now married, Mr and Mrs Jones\nare giving us a second glimpse into\ntheir kinky games for her second\nsingle, Blindfold Me, from her\nfourth LP titled Kelis Was Here.\nThis track has 'Kelis' written all\nover it from the weirdly pitched\nintroduction to the blazing synth\neffects. Nas does his thing and\nlays down a mean verse near the\nend and there we have it \u2013 probably not as radio-friendly as\nher competition (Beyonce's\nnext UK single, Irreplaceable\nor Rihanna\u2019s We Ride) but\nthis track will not need to be\nre-worked for the club.\nThe formula is familiar\nbut still exciting and the\nabsence of the Neptunes\non the credits confirms\nthat although they were\na big influence on her\nsound, she without\ndoubt owns it.\nJemil Salami\nfine. It's the kind of thing their contemporaries in the indie folk scene\nhave achieved time and time again\nwith little effort. However, it leaves\nme begging to see someone like Architecture in Helsinki get as much\nhype as these guys have, because\nthe Magic Numbers really don't deserve a lot of the praise.\nMatt Long\n20 felix Friday 20 October 2006\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Above that, I endeavour to STRENGTHEN YOUR VOICE in the ULU so that your concerns and suggestions\nwill be fully understood and pushed forward.\nWe pay huge for ULU membership.

It is my commitment that there shall be intensive communication between ICU and ULU and\nmore collaboration opportunities between us and other ULU members, resulting in more tangible welfare and interesting activities for YOU.\nVote for LIN MEI, see a di\ufb00erence to be made.\nVarun Reddy\nNo manifesto submitted...\nRON Re Open Nominations - Steven Brown\nRON would re-name \u201cEqual Opportunities O\ufb03cer\u201d to \u201cAthletics Union President\u201d.

In the year where\nImperial becomes an independent university and\nwe are forced to deal with the consequences of our\nwithdrawal from the University of London Union,\nexternal issues surrounding our access to national\nand regional representation are fast becoming\nmatters of great importance to ICU. I am wholly supportive of this referendum\nand I look forward to engaging fully in this debate over the next few weeks.\nMy own views on the NUS will be made clear in the comments section of Felix\nin good time; however, I will refrain from commenting on o\ufb03cial Union pages\nas these should always remain neutral. The word on the ground is that this\nvote will go down to the wire so we can expect to see colourful campaigns,\nheated debates, and (I hope) a whopping turnout this November. We haven\u02bct\nheld a referendum at Imperial College for \ufb01ve years so enjoy this moment\nwhile it lasts!\nCouncil elections\nAfter what seems an age of waiting, the polls will \ufb01nally open for elections to\nthe Union Council next week. Many positions are contested this time round\nand voting in these elections simply could not be easier. All you need to do is\nlog in to our voting website at www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote between\nOctober 27th and 31st, select the election that you are interested in and then\nenter a number (i.e. order of preference) next to the name of your preferred\ncandidate(s). I will send an email to all members whom are registered on our\nmailing list advising how to vote next week. The results will be announced\nin Da Vinci\u02bcs at 12:30pm on November 2nd, but that\u02bcs not the end of it\nbecause\u2026\nMore elections!\nThere are still a handful of vacancies that we need to \ufb01ll as soon as possible.\nThere are positions available in the undergraduate natural sciences and\npostgraduate engineering constituencies and the Welfare Campaigns O\ufb03cer\nposition is also still vacant. We will be publicising advice on how you can\nrun for these positions shortly after we announce the results to the online\nelections. It is likely that we will be running the next round of elections from\nthe \ufb02oor at the third Council Meeting, which will take place on November\n13th.\nAnd finally\nThe mischievous Felix Editor has informed me that there is relatively little\nnews around at the moment and he has asked me to \u201cscrew something up\u201d to\ncreate a good news story. Clearly I am not trying hard enough and so I shall\nendeavour to mess something up in time for the next Felix deadline.\nJohn Collins\nPresident\npresident@imperial.ac.uk\nUpdate\nfrom the President\nIt\u02bcs an inevitable fact of life that at some point\nyou are going to fall ill. This may be no more\nthan a \ufb02u which requires a few days in bed and\nsome TLC, but there are other cases in which you\nwill need to seek medical help and this can often\nmean you will be issued with a prescription. And\nthat means money \u2013 for each prescription you are\nissued with you will be charged \u00a36.65. For oneo\ufb00 cases that may not sound like much, but for\nongoing treatment the costs can quickly add up.\nLuckily it\u02bcs not all bad news. Anybody on a low\nincome, including students, can apply for help\nwith their health costs. This covers not only\nprescriptions but dental care, eye tests and\nglasses, dental treatment and (if, like me, you\nsu\ufb00er with a rapidly receding hairline) even wigs. Virtually all students will\nqualify for this support and you simply need to \ufb01ll in an HC1 form which is\navailable from the Health Centre (in Prince\u02bcs Gardens) or online at www.ppa.\norg.uk. The form can take up to six weeks to be processed, so to make sure\nyou enjoy all the bene\ufb01ts of cost free druggy goodness, \ufb01ll it now before you\nfall ill.\nHaving had a sizeable chunk of October to settle in, it\nmight be beginning to dawn on most postgraduates\nwhat a di\ufb00erent kettle of \ufb01sh their next stage of their\neducation.\nTo many Masters students, the intensity of their\ncourses may come as a shock (or to those hardworking few a relished challenge!). Don\u02bct worry, if you\ndon\u02bct know what I\u02bcm talking about, you will do soon\nenough as you\u02bcre inundated with twice the amount of\npapers to read per course than you might have had for\nall your courses combined in one undergraduate year!\nFor many, using a Masters as an opportunity to\nchange their primary focus of study, or those coming\nfrom a foreign country, this task is made all the\nmore mammoth as they struggle with the advanced\nterminology. I hope the lost Greek students from the\nHammersmith campus who came up to me yesterday\nwith 1,001 (albeit valid!) questions were able to \ufb01nd\nthe glossary of biological terms (a.k.a. \u201cHenderson\u02bcs\u201d) I\nrecommended to them. Not to mention the best places\nto go for discounts of course!\nFor those of you doing a PhD and rubbing your hands\nwith glee at not having to do another exam for as\nlong as you live (unless you\u02bcre unlucky and by some\nchance your professor enrols you onto a course!),\nthings might seem rosy. Indeed your life might seem\nan incarnation of Parisian caf\u00e9 culture as you go for\nendless intellectual meetings with supervisor and\npeers alike (although this is more likely to be at the\nSenior Common Room than the charming little place\non Gloucester Road). Fear not, your time will soon\nseem to have \ufb02own by you and you\u02bcll \ufb01nd yourself\npanicking to make those damned experiments work\nwhilst simultaneously \ufb01nishing o\ufb00 a 100,000-word\nthesis before your funding and the \u201clavish\u201d lifestyle it\nsustains, go out the window.\nLife as a postgraduate can be a surprise and quite\ndi\ufb00erent from anything you\u02bcve experienced before.\nYou\u02bcll have more independence to pursue your own\ninterests but this may also be accompanied with full\nresponsibility and many of you may \ufb01nd the pressure\nof this latter point stressful. Many might also \ufb01nd\nthat they are simply not in the right lab or with the\nright supervisor. Some may even feel bullied and feel\nso strongly dissatis\ufb01ed that they desperately want to\nchange their situation. Others might be upset with the\ncourse content as the prospectus may have misled\nthem somewhat. Yet others may be adamant about\ntheir exam papers being remarked as they simply could\nnot have done that badly. The list goes on and on and\ncan be as long and varied as the number of di\ufb00erent\nprogrammes on which people can enrol on here\nImperial College. Each individual can have their own\nindividual set of problems; this is what can make being\na postgraduate a bit more frustrating as you may feel\nthat no-one will understand your particular problem or\nyou don\u02bct know where to turn.\nIf you have pursued every local avenue that is available\nand you feel like you\u02bcre banging your head against a\nbrick wall, there is still one more possibility open to\nyou and that is me. I\u02bcm the postgraduate representative\nat the Students\u02bc Union and many may already have met\nme. But if not, I tend to reside with my cups of co\ufb00ee\n(and yes you can talk to me over your very own free cup\nof co\ufb00ee) in the \ufb01rst \ufb02oor o\ufb03ces of the Union Building\nat Beit Quadrangle.\nMy job is also made more e\ufb03cient and my\nrepresentation of the postgraduate community more\naccurate by the Graduate Students\u02bc Association (GSA).\nEvery postgraduate is automatically a member of this\nassociation and can come along to any of its meetings,\nbut a select few may wish to get more involved by\nholding more prominent positions in its committees.\nThe committees are\ncomprised of the Activities\nCommittee, the Academic\nA\ufb00airs Committee\nand the Executive\nCommittee (which has\nrepresentatives from both\nother committees and the\nSabbatical team).\nThe Activities Committee\nconsists of anyone whom\nwishes to help host events\nfor the postgraduate\ncommunity. Many of you may (or may not!) feel that\nyou want to do something di\ufb00erent from your average\nundergraduate\u02bcs night out and so can opt to attend the\nActivities Committee meetings to put in your two cents.\nThere are o\ufb03cial positions within the Committee such\nas the Activities Co-ordinator and the Communications\nO\ufb03cer (who looks after publicity such as the website,\n\ufb02yers and posters). Remember that your ideas should\nbe as varied as the postgraduates the GSA represents,\nwho can be anything from the age of 21 upwards (or\nalternatively, have the mental age and intentions of\nan 18 year-old!), be married or single, enjoy the \ufb01ner\nthings in life, want to explore London and so on.\nIt can be an exciting and challenging occupation\ncatering to such diverse needs and we tried to do\nthis at our successful \u201cShowtime\u201d event on Monday\n2nd October. Your inboxes were probably inundated\nad-nauseum with information about this event, but\nit was your chance to meet a huge community of\npostgraduates existing and new at Imperial-this was\nexempli\ufb01ed by the 500-strong attendance! The next\nevent we are proposing to do jointly with the Royal\nCollege of Art and the Royal College of Music on the\nNovember 9th in dB\u02bcs. So come down if you want to\ndiscover an interesting melange of people, music and\nart performances!\nThe Academic A\ufb00airs committee is composed mainly\nof Faculty Research and Taught Representatives. If you\nwant a list for your faculty, please email me; they will\nconvey any complaints on to me.\nThis year, the GSA also hopes to gain many external\na\ufb03liations for those of you with career aspirations\nother than academia. For example we already have\nthe opportunity to sell discounted memberships to\nthe Chartered Management Institute (ranging from\n\u00a330-\u00a345, normal individual memberships cost \u00a350). If\nyou are interested in building career contacts, the GSA\nis also hoping to work closely with Imperial College\nFinance Society (ICFS) in order to hold a careers fair\nmore speci\ufb01cally aimed at postgraduates. With their\nunique set of skills, many postgraduates can command\nhigher salaries and more bespoke roles than provided\nin an average Graduate scheme, but many do not\nknow this and often companies do not advertise these\nopportunities well enough.\nOn top of this we are hoping to hold a special GSA\nCentenary event in the Spring/Summer term. There\nwill be a conference during the day (speakers are yet\nto be con\ufb01rmed but lets just say that every one of you\nwill have heard of them!) followed by an evening of\nentertainment. Watch this space and contact me if you\nwant to get involved.\nPlease visit www.imperialcollegeunion.org/gsa for\nmore information on the o\ufb03cers of the GSA and its\nconstitution. People are still being elected to these\nposts throughout October so keep your eyes peeled for\na chance to vote them online.\nIf you want to email me: dpgs@imperial.ac.uk.\nShama Rahman\nDeputy President\n(Graduate Students)\ndpgs@imperial.ac.uk\nWelcome Message\nFrom the Deputy President (Graduate Students)\nBen Harris\nDeputy President\n(Education & Welfare)\ndpew@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

The school\u2019s headmaster is obsessed with breaking into\nthe ranks of those schools that regularly send boys up to Oxford and\nCambridge. Hence, Irwin, a shrewd\nnewcomer, is enlisted to coach the\nboys into intellectual shape for the\ntrials ahead.\nWhile the boys are seduced by the\nexam-busting bag of tricks offered\nby the temporary supply teacher,\nthe story becomes just a little spicier as the boys are torn by their loyalty to the hugely eccentric, poetry-spouting English master Hector\nand the regular diet of nourishing\nfacts and figures dispensed by Mrs.\nLintott, their history mistress.\nThe journey of The History Boys\nbecomes a light-hearted and eye-opening exploration of the education system and lulls into the story\nthrough the perspectives of eight\nboys whom you could easily relate\nto.

Family, educa-tion, opportunities are all taken for\ngranted, while basics such as ac-commodation, food and health are\nnot even considered.\nImagine if you were an orphan.\nWhat would your life be like then?\nWhat you are envisaging is not even\nhalf as tragic as a real orphan\u2019s life.\nFactor into this the ravages of\nwar. Your surroundings are piles\nof rubble and dust, littered with\nunexploded cluster bombs. Your\ninfrastructure is nothing more than\nbombed roads, crumbling bridges,\nburnt ambulances and an oil slick\non the beach. There is no electric-ity, clean water or fuel for trans-port. What remains of your education is what remains of your shelled\nschool. Now, try and imagine what\nit would be like to be an orphan in\nthese conditions. You can\u2019t. And this\nis the story of Lebanese orphans\nand children.\nDuring the 34-day war, the Lebanese nation received more than\n7,000 air strikes, 2,500 naval shells,\nand countless bullets. 1,183 people\nhave died in Lebanon, a third of\nthem children; 4,054 people have\nbeen injured and 970,000 displaced.\nAt the cost of \u00a31.8bn, 30,000 houses,\n120 bridges, 94 roads, 25 fuel sta-tions, 900 businesses, 5 hospitals,\nand 31 \u201cvital points\u201d, such as air-ports, ports, water and sewage\ntreatment plants, and electrical\nfacilities, have all been destroyed\n(Source: UN).\nWith this background in mind\neach and every year the Islamic Society runs a charity campaign, Save\na Nation, to raise money for and\nawareness about desperate situations around the world and this\nyear has dedicated the Save a Nation (SaN) campaign to the children\nand orphans of Lebanon, through\nthe Disasters Emergency Commitee (Islamic Relief charity)\nIslam places a heavy emphasis on\ncharitable acts. Not only is charity\n(Zakat in arabic) obligatory on all\nMuslims, it is one of the five defining pillars of Islam, with the poor\nand needy having the constitutional\nright in Muslim countries to a minimum of 2.5% of everyone\u2019s wealth\n(not income). The Quran says: \u201cEstablish prayer and dispense the purifying alms (zakat) and bow in worship with those who bow\u201d (Chapter\n2: Verse 43). In past years, the campaign has raised over \u00a360,000 for\nAfghanistan, Sudan, Bangladesh,\nIraq, and recently for the victims\nof the Pakistan earthquake. The\nrelief work has involved emergency\nfood distribution, supply of clean\nwater, basic sanitation, education\nrehabilitation, to mention but a few.\nThe campaign coincides with the\nholy month of Ramadhaan, a month\nthat involves a lot more than fasting\nalone. The spirit of Ramadhaan is\none of self-control, devotion to God\nand sharing one\u2019s wealth with the\nneedy. Fasting helps us empathise\nwith those who are less fortunate.\nYet one cannot begin to feel the suffering of those whose lands have\nbeen struck by war, famine and\ndrought. Similarly one cannot comprehend the happiness a child or a\nmother goes through on receipt of\nthe generosity of people like you.\nThe Save a Nation campaign was\ntherefore launched with the desire\nto practice the great teachings of\nHow odd? Having graduated two\nyears ago \u2013 I find myself writing\nonce more to the old feline rag.\nThe Save a Nation Appeal \u2013 an\nIslamic Society project has hit campus again, this year being it\u2019s sixth.\nTo date it has raised some \u00a375,000\nfor five countries from struggling\nSudan to earthquake hit Kashmir\nlast year. There is no doubt that\nthousands of lives across the world\nhave been positively affected as a\nresult of the campaign. Yet, when\nwe started it all six years ago \u2013 I\nnever thought I was going to be one\nof those people.\nI don\u2019t for one minute compare\nmy life to the cruel realities of life\nin a mud and straw raquba in Darfur or myself to those poor children\ndestined to spend a second winter\nin the Himalayan mountains with\nonly a piece of cloth to protect\nthem. But neither can I deny that it\nhas changed my life.\nMy story is one of an IC graduate\nwho realised that perhaps there\ntruly was more to life and happiness than money \u2013 and decided to\ndo something to reflect that. Don\u2019t\nget me wrong \u2013 I\u2019m not brave \u2013 naive is perhaps more the order of\nthe day but my life is more than full\nand I am so immensely happy. The\nchoice I faced was one of stark con-trast. I suppose I figured there can\nbe no harm in helping others and\nlearning more about oneself along\nthe way \u2013 especially when the alternative was to help myself, and learn\nmore about one.\nI work for an organisation that\nwas founded by a medical student\n22 years ago; the first donation was\n20p from a young lad of seven or\neight who just wanted to make a\ndifference. What a world of difference they made. Two decades later,\nand that greying student, Dr Hany\nel-Banna mobilises thousands of\nstudents every year. That 20p has\ngrown into \u00a322 million.

Unfortunately,\nprobably not what was experienced\nat the opening of \u2018Fairground:Thrill\nLaboratory\u2019.\nTha Dana Centre, the adult\nonly bar and discussion forum on\nQueen\u2019s Gate, is holding a three\nweek event to explore our fascination with thrill, via the medium\nof the fairground ride. Over the\ncourse of the three sessions, the\nthemes \u2018Pleasure\u2019, \u2018Frission\u2019 and\n\u2018Excitement\u2019 will be subjected to\nthe rigorous testing of the \u2018Thrill\nLaboratory\u2019.\nThe event kicked off last tuesday\nwith a multimedia investigation\nof how we experience \u2018Pleasure\u2019.\nThe Staff of the Dana centre have\ntransformed their premises into\nan approximation of a fairground,\ncomplete with live DJ, bright lights,\nand fast food canapes (mini burg-ers, hot dogs and fish\u2019n\u2019chips!)\nBizarrely however, one\u2019s enjoyment of a sneaky toffee-apple is\nsoon disturbed by a balloon wav-ing, white jumpsuit-sporting \u2018Thrill\nTechnician\u2019, exhorting you to have\n\u2018fun\u2019, or later, to pull funny faces\n(terrified, surprised, thrilled). The\nemphasis this evening was on\ninteraction,including a ride on the\nfairgound ride \u2018Miami Trip\u2019 hooked\nup to videolink and heart monitor.\nHowever well intetioned, this par-ticlular reviewer did feel slightly\nlike she\u2019d stumbled into a primary\nschool popuated by 30-something\nscience nuts.\nThe main attraction of the event,\napart from the enormous \u2018Miami\nTrip\u2019 parked outside, was a hand\npicked selection of academics,\neach giving a short presentation\non \u2018Pleasure\u2019. At 10 minutes long,\nthese were perfect for an evening\naudience, long enough to inform,\nand even to entertain, but short\nenough to prevent thoughts straying back to the bar. Subjects covered\nincluded the relationship between\nPleasure and Crime, and whether\nor not machines and robots can\nexperience emotion. Most interesting however was Claire O\u2019Malley\u2019s\ntalk on our interpretations of facial\nexpressions, and how easy it is to\nconfuse surprise and fear.\nThe Thrill Laboratory is an ambitious event, not un-beset by technical problems and unsmoothed edg-es. Once these teething problems\nhave been outgrown, this event\nshould mature into a fascinating,\nand even fun take on our hedonistic\npursuit of thrills.\nThrills and spills\nSKA trekking across the universe\nGalileo used his telescope to tell\nus that the earth went round the\nsun, and in doing so, fundamentally\nchanged the way mankind thought\nabout itself. In our lifetime, astronomers are preparing for another rev-olution, this time from the world\u2019s\nlargest ever telescope, planned for\noperation in 2020.\nThe SKA (Square Kilometre Array) offers exciting possibilities,\nenabling us to see further into\nspace than ever before. We may be\nable to finally uncover the secrets\nof the structure of the universe and\nsearch for life on other planets.\nSurprisingly, this revolution may\ncome from an area of barren orange soil in the outback of Australia. Mileura station in Western Australia has recently been selected,\nalong with another place in South\nAfrica, to be a possible site for the\ntelescope. These desolate areas\nhave been chosen as they are dry,\nhave clear skies and are far from\nthe interference of radiation from\nmodern civilisation.\n\u201cThis is a very large project involving 55 institutions in 17 different\ncountries,\u201d says Professor Richard\nSchilizzi, the International Director\nbased at the SKA headquarters in\nThe Netherlands. \u201cWith this telescope we will be able to go back\nto more than 90% of the age of the\nuniverse.\u201d\nSKA will be a radio telescope\nwith a collecting area of one million\nsquare metres \u2013 equivalent to 200\nfootball pitches \u2013 making it 50 times\nFelix talks to International SKA Director Professor Richard Schilizzi about a new variation of space invader\nmore sensitive and 10,000 times\nfaster than current telescopes. Radio telescopes collect waves emitted by radio sources, usually via\nlarge antennas or dishes.\nLike the rings of a cosmic tree\ntrunk, radiation from the deepest\nparts of the universe can give us\ninformation about its history. The\nSKA will be able to examine radiation from the gases which became\nthe first stars and galaxies. This\nwill give us a clearer picture of how\nthe universe evolved.\nAncient information from the very\nfirst stars, galaxies and black holes\nwill be recorded for the first time,\ngiving us a clearer picture of our\nbeginnings. \u201cThe big bang was 13.7\nbillion years ago,\u201d explains Prof\nSchilizzi. \u201cWe will be able to look at\nthis very early stage, perhaps within a billion years of the big bang,\nwhen the universe began to form.\u201d\nAs well as this early history, scientists hope to be able to peer into\na crystal ball and see where the universe is headed. The Array will help\nto explain the mysterious \u2018dark energy\u2019, a force pushing the cosmos\napart at an ever increasing speed.\nBy observing the distribution of the\nuniverse\u2019s most abundant element,\nneutral hydrogen, the SKA will look\nat the role and properties of dark\nenergy, and help us make sense of\nthis strange force.\nAlien life forms should also beware \u2013 SKA will be searching for\nyou. Astronomers will use the telescope to look for earth-like planets\naround other suns and radiation\nfrom extraterrestrial life in our gal-axy. For the first time, we will be\nable to detect tiny amounts of radiation from other planets. Signals as\nsmall as those emitted by TV sets\nor radar equipment, for example,\ncould be detected. \u201cSKA will be able\nto pick up radars from other civilisations close to us,\u201d says Professor\nSchilizzi. \u201cIt is certainly something\nthat we are interested in.\u201d\nScientists are also keen to use\nSKA to extensively test Einstein\u2019s\nfamous Theory of Relativity. The\nbehaviour of dead stars, or pulsars,\nwill be analysed and compared with\nEinstein\u2019s predictions. This will\nprovide with information to test\nthe validity of Einstein\u2019s theories.\nProfessor Schilizzi is confident that\nSKA will pick up around 20,000 pulsars and that \u201cat least one example\nof a pulsar will be around a stellar\nblack hole, which can be used for\ntesting Einstein\u2019s theory in a strong\nfield case\u201d.\nThe SKA is a massive project,\ncosting over 1 billion euros. But it\nhas the potential to answer most\nof the outstanding questions in astronomy today \u2013 from alien life to\nthe origins of the universe. Construction on SKA is planned in 5\nyears time, once the large group\nof collaborators from Argentina,\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, China,\nFrance, Germany, India, Italy, The\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Poland,\nRussia, South Africa, Sweden, the\nUK and the US decide on a final\ndesign, funding and a site for the\nproject.\nIt is likely that SKA will raise\nmore questions than answer them.\nProfessor Schilizzi refuses to speculate on what SKA could reveal, but\nhe does say that \u201call we can say for\nthe moment is that every telescope\n[that was a major advance] found\nthings that were absolutely not predicted ahead of time\u201d.

    "content": "Quit it with the monkey business\nHas Horizon lost its credibility as a leading science program investigating whether Chimps Are People Too\nHorizon has employed its first\nlive human presenter \u2013 the offbeat\nwriter and self-confessed non-sci-entist Danny Wallace. His mission\nwas to investigate the premise that\nChimps Are People Too. How far\ndid the programme succeed in exploring this claim? Did it meet Horizon\u2019s usual standards? And was it\nworth watching?\nWallace fittingly spent much time\nobserving or \u2018hanging out\u2019 with our\nclosest ape cousins, whether running free in the wilds of Africa or\nconfined within research centres in\nthe US and Europe. We saw chimpanzees vocalising in the Ugandan\nforest, co-operating in tasks at the\nEdward Wawrzynczak Max Planck Institute in Leipzig,\nand learning from each other at\nthe Yerkes Primate Center in Atlanta. Between demonstrations of\nsuch human-like behaviours, the\npresenter acted as our enthusiastic guide and interpreter, sharing\nhis thoughts, feelings and opinions\nwith us.\nMemorably, we also visited the\nfacility that is home to a family of bonobo chimps, another close\ncousin of ours. There Wallace met,\ncommunicated and played with the\nfamous Kanzi. This ape has learnt\nto understand a vocabulary of more\nthan 500 words and to \u2018talk\u2019 by the\nuse of symbols. For more than twen-ty-five years, primatologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh has raised a small\ngroup of these apes as if they were\npart of her own family. She is dismissive of research involving caged\nanimals and is convinced that if you\ntreat a bonobo like a person, it will\nbecome more like a person.\nThere were moments when\nDanny\u2019s tongue-in-cheek wit was\ngenuinely funny. In the jungle,\nhe looked affronted when St. Andrew\u2019s researcher Katie Slocombe\ninformed him that chimps are five\ntimes stronger than the average\nhuman male. He boasted of being\nat least \u2018half-chimp\u2019 and wondered\nif the chimps would challenge him\nto arm wrestle. \u201cI\u2019ve got tactics,\u201d\nhe bragged to Katie\u2019s bemusement.\nPausing only briefly, she whispered:\n\u201cThey\u2019ll probably just kill you.\u201d\n\u201cGood tactics,\u201d observed the instantly deflated Danny.\nSadly, as the programme wore\non, the cheap laughs became over-whelming. Wallace\u2019s attempts to\ncanvass support for a campaign to\nrecognise chimps as people at a\nRoyal Society meeting were fatu-ous. A ludicrous test for pheromones involving T-shirt sniffing, tied\nin with the customary images of\nlab paraphernalia and white-coated\nscientists, lacked merit. And a shot\nof bonobos enthusiastically copulating was simply gratuitous. Most\ndisappointing was that all this tomfoolery diverted attention from the\nreal story.\nWe have come to understand\nmore and more about our evolutionary relationship to chimpanzees since the time of Darwin. But\nit was only last year that we were\nable to put a precise number on just\nhow close that genetic similarity is.\nRemarkably, the DNA making up\nthe genomes of human and chimp\nis more than 99% identical. Yet it is\nplain to see that we are different.\nWhy? We were given hints that the\nreason must lie in the 1% or so of\nDNA that we do not share, and that\nthis has something to do with our\nbig brains, but these tantalising observations were not followed up.\nWhere Horizon feared to tread,\nChannel 4 pressed ahead un-daunted. It handled the subject\naltogether better in a two-part programme What Makes Us Human,\nwhich aired over the summer. In\nthis, Imperial scientist and author\nArmand Marie Leroi introduced us\nto the biology believed to underlie\nthe uniqueness of humans. With\nurbanity and understated humour,\nhe explained how specific genetic\nchanges are thought to have driven\na relatively recent and rapid evolution of the human brain.\nThe human brain has trebled in\nsize since humans and chimpanzees last shared a common ances-tor. In particular, the expansion of\nthe cerebral cortex, the part of the\nbrain that we use to do our think-ing, has pushed human capabilities\nfar beyond those of our ape-like\nancestors and their non-human\ndescendents. We have developed\nnew cognitive abilities \u2013 the use\nof complex syntax, the capacity to\ninterpret one another\u2019s intentions,\nand the skill to imitate the actions\nof others \u2013 that appear to have been\ncritical to the formation of human\nsociety and culture.\nClearly, traits such as tool-use and\nlanguage, which were once seen as\ncharacteristics able to distinguish\nhumans and apes, are no longer so\ndefinitive. But the skills shown by\nchimps are only rudimentary compared with those of humans \u2013 they\nare limited in their capabilities\nbecause their brains do not work\nin the same way that ours do. So,\nchimps are not human \u2013 and they\ncannot be people \u2013 even if some of\nus would like them to be.\nOur uniquely human qualities\nhave allowed us to dominate and\nmanipulatethenaturalworldandits\ncreatures. Ironically, this was perfectly demonstrated by two scenes\nfrom the Horizon programme. In\none, we saw chimps within a fenced\ncompound being trained for Hollywood and our entertainment. In the\nother, we saw the bonobos in their\nenclosed research centre being observed in the name of science and\nour enlightenment.\nHorizon has strayed into the\nfuzzy territory somewhere between\nentertainment and enlightenment.\nThere is clearly something engaging about a cheeky chappie messing around with comical chimps\nand the prospect of slapstick tomfoolery not too far away. But this\nis surely a new concept \u2013 Horizon\n\u2018Lite\u2019 \u2013 offering a flavour that may\nappeal to a larger audience but with\nan aftertaste that is definitely less\nsatisfying.\nWhile there is a role for science\nwith a smile, and scope for novel\napproaches to popularisation, let\nus hope that this is not achieved\nby trivialising research and those\nengaged in it. Indeed, it would be\na great disservice to the viewing\npublic if scientists were turned into\nfreaks at the circus for the sake of\nthe clowns.\nWatch TV? Write about it.\nContact us. Now.\ntv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe first live presenter of Horizon, Danny Wallace, poses for the camera.\nA still from Quentin Tarantino\u2019s latest cinematic offering.\nHorizon: Chimps Are People Too explores the differences between chimp and human capabilities.\n26 felix Friday 20 October 2006\nTV tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Various Artists\nPlague Songs\n(4AD)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nlive reviews\nAlbum\u2019s plague of boredom\nThis bizarre concept compilation, featuring legendary names, is a bit of a mixed bag\nThe concept behind Plague Songs\nis straightforward; ten songs based\non each of the plagues of Egypt,\npresented in Biblical plague order.\nThe picture this paints of the album\nbefore even opening the case is a\nbizarre one. A collection of singer-songwriters singing about horrific\ndevastation just doesn\u2019t feel right \u2013\nit feels too twee to do the topic any\njustice.\nHowever, the first song on the\nalbum dispels such notions im-mediately. Klashnekoff\u2019s Blood is\na sinister hip hop polemic which\nopens with a corruption of the\nLord\u2019s prayer, \u201cOur Father who art\nin heaven, hallowed be thy name,\nthy Kingdom is in flames\u201d. It goes\non to describe a situation of urban\ndecline, referencing the war in\nIraq, gun crime and even Quentin\nTarantino.\nWhat is barely referenced, how-ever, is the plague of blood itself. In\nfact, the first song on the album is\nthe least faithful to the original story though paradoxically one of the\nThree reviews in London\u2019s big venues\nThis is far from the first time I\u2019ve\nmanaged to see The Subways this\nyear. However, this gig was easily\nthe best show I\u2019ve ever seen them\nperform.\nOriginally meant to play last April\nthe band had to reschedule after\nBilly Lunn (lead vocals & guitar)\ninjured his throat and had to take\ntime out to let it heal. But now at\nthe end of their UK tour and having\njust come from the festival circuit\nthere was no sign of any problem.\nSupported by the up-and-coming\nDodgems (who were as usual su-perb) and not quite to my taste but\ngood nevertheless, Larrikin Love.\nThe Subways treated us to a\nperfect set of varied and extended\nalbum tracks. Most of the time it\nwas hard to tell if it was Billy you\ncould hear or the hundred other\npeople around you who all knew\nthe words, which only added to the\nnight. While dropping in the odd\nnew song here and there (definitely\nlook out for the next album) and\nperforming a 15 minute version of\ntheir now nearly legendary Rock\nand Roll Queen, Billy still managed\nto go for a extended wander around\nthe venue before crowd-surfing of\none of the 10 foot high balconies to\nfinish the set. You could tell they really wanted to finish their tour with\na bang, and surrounded by some\npretty hardcore fans they did that\nand more.\nSam Lombard\nW\nhilst laying out\nand editing this\nweek\u2019s music sec-tion,Igotthinking.\nMy first thoughts\nwere: why am I here spending time\nfiddling with images at 11pm when\nI should be at home, beer in hand,\nwatching The Daily Show for my\nfix of American satire? Resigned to\nmy fate, I then began to think about\nreviews and what they mean. It is\nsomething which could be explored\nby someone more academic but I\u2019ll\nramble on nevertheless.\nI remember when I first started\nreading reviews those many years\nago. I started off by reading ones of\nthings I had bought. This may seem\npointless since theoretically you\nread a good review and then go out\nand buy the record. However, I read\nthese reviews to either feel glorified in my choice of purchase or a\nreview would often give me pointers for listening. I was young and\nneeded guidance I guess, and found\nthose critics\u2019 professional ears use-ful. I thought about this some more\nand realised that their ears must\u2019ve\nhad an effect on my own and thus I\nwas just replicating their opinions.\nThinking about this got me para-noid; I mean, how do I know what\nI really like if I am just replicating\nthe loop of \u2018good-taste\u2019. I then had a\ncookie and realised that I have disagreed with reviewers all the time.\nUltimately reviews are to give you\na guide to music you might want to\nbuy. If we aren\u2019t fulfilling this, this\nis because public relations companies for the bands (both independent and obscure or major label)\nsend us a limited range of CDs. Our\nreadership is small so we aren\u2019t\nthe priority for these companies.\nAnother reason is that our reviewers do this voluntarily; they are not\npaid to sit down and listen to stuff\nthey may not \u2018get\u2019. We are limited to\nour scope of knowledge and taste.\nIf you feel you can fill a hole in the\nmusic we cover then e-mail music.\nfelix@ic.ac.uk.\nSomething you should all go to\nis a gig tomorrow (Saturday 21st)\nin the Union. It is \u00a33 to get in from\n7.30pm with 4 bands playing. There\nis a door price because the headliner need their flight price covered\nas they\u2019re from San Franciso, USA.\nThey\u2019re called Citizens Here and\nAbroad and they\u2019re brilliant. Look\nthem up online and then come\ndown. Look out for posters.\nEditorial\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nmost evocative of the theme.\nThe contrast between the first\nsong and the next is striking. King\nCreosote\u2019s calm, whimiscal ballad\nRelate the Tale narrates the plague\nof frogs from the point of view of a\nfrog, and comes across as a defence\nof the individual members of the\nplague. A similar approach is taken\ntoward the end of the album by Imogen Heap, whose Glittering Cloud\nis a catchy dance number sung in\nthe character of a positively apologetic locust.\nUnfortunately, between these two\nsongs comes only one of any great\ninterest \u2013 Flies by Brian Eno and\nRobert Wyatt, a beautiful pastoral\nambient piece played over a constant buzzing \u2013 while the others\nrange from the insipid to the downright irritating.\nThe end of the album, though, is\nevery bit as strong as the beginning.\nScott Walker\u2019s Darkness is quite\nsimply terrifying, with his quiet\ntones echoed by a loud, shrill choir,\nand Rufus Wainwright\u2019s Katonah\non the death of the firstborn, and\nparticularly his recently departed\ncousin, is profoundly moving.\nPlague Songs comes across as\nsomething of an unfinished work.\nWhilst the better songs on it are\nastounding, to a lesser or greater\nextent, almost half of the songs are\nuninspiring, verging on unlisten-able (reminiscent of the plagues).\nIt feels as though those behind\nthe project were too polite to reject certain works that didn\u2019t come\nup to the level of quality they were\nclearly aspiring towards, which is a\nterrible shame, given the rest of the\nalbum.\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nThe Subways\nShepherds Bush Empire\nHHHHI\nAFI\nBrixton Carling Academy\nBefore I start this review I just want\nto clear up a few issues. Yes I know\nAFI (A Fire Inside) are rubbish,\nthey are cheesy and most songs\nsound the same. Although they have\nfollowed the likes of Minor Threat\nand gone \u2018straight edge\u2019, foregoing drugs, smoking and alcohol\nfor the music, they still sold out to\nDreamworks instead of staying on\nthe small label Nitro; managing to\nperform poorer in the moral standings than the musical. Yet they still\nremain my biggest guilty pleasure\nand are in my top 5 favourite bands\nof all time.\nThe tour is to promote their new\nalbum Decemberunderground.\nThe album moves further away\nfrom their punk hardcore roots to\ncatchier and higher production value songs with a tint of Duran Duran, god forgive.\nHoping the new album wouldn\u2019t\ndominate the show I turned upto\nthe Brixton Academy an hour-and-a-half after the doors opened.\nI missed the first band and being\nsubjected to the second (watching\nthem did involve large quantities of\npain and pity in equal measure).\nAs the roadies set-up the stage\nfor the headline act, seeing props\nincluding a white painted tree suspended from the ceiling white white\namplifiers and drum-kit, my heart\nsank. Was it going to be an over the\ntop, soulless gig? I had wished for\nsomething not too far from that 3\nminute live video of He Who Laughs\nLast I downloaded off Napster so\nmany years ago.\nNo, in fact the gig was absolutely\namazing. Opening with the intro to\nthe latest album the band followed\nup with Girls Not Grey, played with\nsuch energy as the band members\nran along rows of monitors and\nmounted drum-kits many a time.\nFinally the Days of Phoenix intro\nrang through the Academy, turning the sea of Despair Faction Tshirts into a sweaty frenzy. All my\ndreams were answered a few songs\nlater when they played infamous\nAll Hallows EP, Totalimmortal.\nNearly 7 years made no difference\nto the quality of the performance;it\nwas electric. The whole band were\ndecked out in white T-shirts and\njeans, looking almost dangerously\nlike a bad taste 80s band and although guitarist Puget sported a\nfull on NME hair-do, Davey Havok\nretained the slicked comb over but\nnot yet bald styling that has defined him through the history of the\nband.\nThe encore, a sensible two songs,\ntopped it all off, while running\nthrough the anthem God Called\nIn Sick Today, Havok hardly had\nto sing as the audience sang every\nword with him, and the latest sin-gle, Miss Murder was a fine, upbeat\nend to the night.\nNick Simpson\nalbum review\nPlaying to a venue packed with\nblack-clad metallers that were quite\nclearly awaiting Seether\u2019s rescheduled performance with restless an-ticipation, it looked as though it was\ngoing to be difficult for Essex band\nEngerica to win the crowd over.\nFortunately, Engerica are used to\nplaying support slots for bands with\na cult-like following. Engerica ooze\nconfidence, self-assuredness and\ncharisma, immediately evident as\nfront-man David Gardener struts\nonto the stage dressed in incredibly\ntight trousers and very shiny, pointy\nSeether/Engerica\nThe Astoria, Charing Cross Rd\nblack shoes. Despite the striking\nimpression of the front man, the\nother members of the band don\u2019t\nmake such an impact, it appears\nthat this is David Gardener\u2019s band\nand this is his show.\nEngerica rattle furiously through\nsongs from their debut There Are\nNo Happy Endings. During Did\nYou Hear What Sylvia Said, The\nSmell and Goddamn Suicide you\ncould visibly see increasingly more\nof the audience being won over by\nthe impressive energy levels that\nthe band brought to the venue. As\nEngerica continued, the crowd did\nwhat they do to show appreciation\nof punk-rock i.e. become more and\nmore violent to one another and\nmosh harder and faster. Sadly, despite collecting more fans throughout the gig, they were not playing to\nwin over the Seether fans. Engerica\nhas decided to call it a day after this\ntour, thus the band were evidently\nplaying for their fans, their friends\nand themselves. This was made\nclear when bassist Mike Webster\u2019s\ntwin brother Jim was invited to\nplay drums; this night was about\nEngerica enjoying the experience\nof playing in one of England\u2019s most\nfamous venues.\nEngerica are evidently a band that\nhave been slowly but surely growing\nin strength; they have been nominated for a Metal Hammer award,\nreceived rave reviews and played\nat Download. Consequently you\nget the impression that if had they\npostponed their amicable split for a\nbit longer, they could have achieved\ngreater things. They may have been\nthe support band to Seether, but\nEngerica certainly stole the show\nat the Astoria. Seether may have\npleased their fans however, with\ntheir Nirvana and Neil Young cov-ers, they just didn\u2019t match the style\nor the raw quality of Engerica.\nJenny Gibson\neviews\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nfelix\nFriday 20 October 2006\nR\n\n"

    "content": "City explained: derivatives demystified\nRead the FT on any given day and\nthere is usually more than one article full of derivatives jargon: op-tions, futures, swaps, CDOs, CDS,\nexotics, hybrids\u2026the list is end-less. Warren Buffet once described\nfinancial derivatives as \u201cweapons\nof mass destruction\u201d, Alan Greenspan and the countless number of\ninvestors (or is that speculators?)\ncertainly didn\u2019t seem to think so.\nThe rise of derivatives and their\nuse over the last decade alone has\nbeen startling. Look at Goldman\nSachs\u2019 balance sheet and you can\nquite easily see that income generated from the sales and trading revenue streams, of which derivatives\nform a large part, outstrips M&A\nadvisory income four times over.\nThe industry in its current incarnations has been around in some\nshape or form since the 70s, when 3\nacademics from the Chicago Graduate School of Business \u2013 Myron\nScholes, Fischer Black and Robert\nMerton \u2013 developed the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Futures\nhave been traded on the Chicago\nBoard of Trade (CBOT) since the\nmid-nineteenth century. The more\nquantitative development of areas\nsuch as credit derivatives has happened more recently. A financial\nderivative is described most simply as a financial contract which is\nvalued on some underlying asset or\nevent. This asset or event can literally be anything \u2013 stocks, currency,\nwheat, weather, England winning\nthe World Cup.\nLets stick to wheat, for simplicity.\nImagine a farmer who has a field\non which he grows crops of wheat.\nIn order to grow this wheat, the\nfarmer has put forward a certain\namount of initial outlay of capital,\nmaybe it was his own, maybe he\nborrowed it. Either way, he had to\npay for the land, prepare it, seed it\nand water it. He also would have\nbought fertilizers and pesticides. In\norder to make money, his expenditure needs to be lower than his in-come, simple. His ability to make\nmoney is determined on 2 factors:\nthe amount of wheat he sells (vol-ume) and the market price of the\nwheat. For argument\u2019s sake, lets\ndiscount the volume, and so price\nbecomes the overriding factor, and\nhe has an exposure to changes in\nthe price. If it goes up, he will earn\nmore, if it goes down it will squeeze\nhis margins. There is a risk that the\nprice could fall below what it costs\nhim to produce the wheat, meaning he will run losses. This is where\nderivatives come in. He can enter\ninto a derivative contract to manage that price risk, he could sell the\nwheat in the future but at today\u2019s\nprice, or another mutually agreed,\nfixed price. This is a forward con-tract, or a future.\nIn essence, what the farmer has\ndone is eliminated uncertainty in\nhis future earnings; he is protected\nfrom a huge fall in the price, but\nequally must give up any extra\nprofit if it rises. Fine, but who wants\nto buy wheat forward? Someone\nwith the opposite need, say a baker.\nA baker needs the wheat to make\nhis bread and he may well have exactly the opposite risk exposure as\nthe farmer: if wheat prices rise, the\nfarmer gains but the baker loses\nout, if they fall, the farmer loses out\nbut the baker gains. This is a delivery settled derivative contract. One\ncan speculate of course, and this\nis where cash settled derivatives\ncome into play. You agree a price\nin the contract, called the strike\nprice, but you don\u2019t actually have\nthe wheat delivered to your door.\nThe farmer merely enters into\nthe contract with a dealer, say an\ninvestment bank, without disrupting his own trading relationships.\nIf the price rises above the strike\nprice, the farmer must give up the\ndifference between the actual price\nand the strike price to the dealer\nin cash, if it falls below the strike\nprice, the dealer will pay the farmer\nthe difference.\nHerein lies the problem, the farmer must always give up the extra\nrevenue he would have generated if\nthe price rises had he not entered\ninto a futures contract. He doesn\u2019t\nhave to; he could enter into an options contract instead, more specifically in the case of the farmer a\nput option. A put is essentially an\ninsurance against the price of the\nwheat falling. If it falls below the\nstrike price of the put, the farmer\nis paid the difference by the dealer.\nIf it rises, the farmer need never\nexercise the option and hence can\nreap the rewards of the price rises.\nHe must of course pay the dealer a\npremium for the option, called the\noption premium, just like premium\npaid to an insurance company for\ncar insurance. The premium is determined on the risk exposure the\ndealer assumes on entering into\nthe contract. So we\u2019ve helped the\nfarmer, what about the baker? He\nis worried about price rises, so he\ncould purchase a call option, if the\nprice is below the strike price he\ncan continue to buy at the market\nprice, as soon as it hits the strike\nprice the option triggers and the\ndealer must now offset the extra\ncost of purchasing wheat.\nThe example of the farmer and\nbaker is quite elementary of course,\nand the risks involved are hedged\nquite easily, this is not always the\ncase. The investment banks in essence act as the dealers, they assume the risks, repackage them,\nand shift them off their balance\nsheet onto someone else. In short,\nsomeone else holds the ticking time\nbomb.\nImperial\u2019s entrepreneurs challenge\nMonday 9 October marked the\nlaunch of the Entrepreneurs Challenge for the forthcoming academic\nyear. The annual prize fund of \u00a355\n000 attracted undergraduates and\nfaculty alike, from all disciplines.\nAny individual \u2013 regardless of their\nprevious experience \u2013 is invited to\nuse the two-part competition as a\nforum for exploring business ideas\nwithout financial risk.\nAlthough as many as 350 000 businesses open their doors each year\nin the UK, just as many go into liq-uidation. Bizhelp, a website providing assistance to small businesses,\nidentified ten major reasons for\ncompanies failing. \u201cLack of skills\u201d\ntops the list. Many people have\nexcellent ideas, but are deficient\nin the technical, management and\nmarketing skills needed to put their\nconcept into effect. The challenge\ngives such people the opportunity\nto harness the experience of industry professionals, whilst at the same\ntime enhancing their knowledge.\nFor the first part of the challenge,\nknown as the \u201cIdeas Challenge,\u201d\nentrants must submit a two-page\nbusiness plan with a 1 200 word-limit. The pro-forma includes various headings such as \u201cwho is your\nmarket?\u201d Learning events, including lectures from the Tanaka Business School, and one-on-one tu-torials, are available to those who\napply. The competition closes on 20\nNovember. Details on how to enter\ncan be found on the website listed\nbelow. There are 10 prizes of \u00a31,000\nand 10 of \u00a3250 which shall be awarded on 7 December at 18.00 in room\n220 Mechanical Engineering.\nThesecondpartofthecompetition\nis \u201cThe New Business Challenge.\u201d\nThis requires entrants to expand\ntheir ideas further and produce a\n10-page plan. This comprehensive\nproposal needs to include technical\ninformation such as cash-flow esti-mates. Teams must then present a\nmarketing-pitch to a panel of investors and judges, a nerve-racking,\nbut potentially rewarding event.\nThe first prize is \u00a325,000 (\u00a315,000\non paid services), there are two\nrunner-up prizes of \u00a35,000 (\u00a33,000\npaid services) and seven \u00a31,000\ncash prizes. In the past, the entire\nprize was in cash. Unfortunately,\nsome teams would spend it on their\nbusiness, and others would indulge\nthemselves. Thenceforth, part of\nthe prize can only be spent on services for launching a new company.\nLast year, there were 300 entries,\nmost of whom were undergraduates with no experience.\nAll the teams took something positive from the experience. Whether\nor not their ideas were taken fur-ther, their business knowledge\ngrew, they learnt to structure their\nthinking and they learnt to sell an\nidea. The experience entrants ac-quire, makes an impressive addition to any resume, in a world\nwhere universities are churning\nout thousands of talented people.\nApply on www3.imperial.ac.uk/\nentrepreneurship/\nentrepreneurschallenge\n\u201cTo succeed in business it is necessary to make others see things as you see them.\u201d\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 income from derivatives sales and trading four times that of M&A\nJayraj Chokshi\nBusiness Correspondent\nThe international petrolium exchange is a one of the largest futures exchanges for energy products\nNew business challenge winning team \u201cIntervent\u201d and runners-up \u201cNap-ease\u201d and \u201cA-fix\u201d 23 March 2006\nMichael Olymbios\nBusiness Editor\n5\nfelix\nFriday 20 October 2006\nBUSINESS business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "Weighing in on the veil issue\nW\ne are forever at\nwar. The end of\nthe cold war era\nmeant jack, there\nis always another\nenemy to fight, more lands to be\nre-conquered, the grip of power\never cemented. I firmly believe\nthat what we now see in Britain,\nand indeed the rest of the world, is\nthe beginning of a subtle process\nthat will in the end lead to the maligning of Muslims being deemed\na \u201cradical fifth column.\u201d The view\nmay very well prevail that not only\ncan they not be trusted, but they\nmust be watched over and defended against with vigilant suspicion.\nAnyone who believes in different\ncore values, dress or systems of\ngoverning life is a danger to all of\nsociety, where even one of these\nindividuals has the ability to cause\nirreversible torment.\nJack Straw is not an idiot, he\ndidn\u2019t get to holding cabinet posts\nby being an idiot who lets his\nmouth run, nor when he lets it\nrun on consecutive days is he unaware of the fire he is flaming. The\nsame applies to John Reid. Both of\nthem gave the same message but\nwith different force, i.e. we have\na segregationist community that\nis a danger to us. Neither could\nbe farther from the truth. In my\nexperience most people at uni-Omar Hashmi urges students to communicate with each other and suggests that\nthere may be something more to recent comments made by Government Ministers\nversity have friends from many\nbackgrounds, especially Islam,\nso if we all do our bit and actually talk to each other I\u2019m sure we\nwould work out that, actually, we\nget on quite well! We don\u2019t have\nto go to the exact same events all\nthe time, but when we meet each\nother we break those \u201ccommon\ncourtesy\u201d barriers and really understand what the other person is\nthinking about. It doesn\u2019t matter\nif she has a face veil on because\n(guess what), you can still talk to\nher! And as long as the content of\nthe conversation is conservative,\nsuitable and necessary it should\nbe fine. How many women wearing niqab have we seen having\ntrouble at schools, hospitals and in\ntheir jobs? If they were isolationist why are they even there? Let\u2019s\nadmit it \u2013 some of us just don\u2019t like\nthe way the other person looks,\nwithout even trying to get to know\nthem. Why are people linking the\nveil to isolationism? I don\u2019t need\nto be naked to talk to you.\nTo what end does it serve making some look different, isolated,\nweak and suspicious? One possible explanation is that it is a massive distraction. As I live in Essex,\nI know some of the people that\nattended the community meeting\nwith John Reid over \u201cwatching\nthe signs of extremism.\u201d The one\nI\nfelt compelled to write having read the article by Seema Pattni (So you think you\nwant to be a doctor?), in last\nweek\u2019s Felix, in order to provide something in the form of a\nresponse.\nMiss Pattni appears to be under\nthe illusion that all other medics,\nat whatever level of their career,\nare mercenary, money-grabbing\ncreatures, concerned only with\npersonal profit, giving no thought\nwhatsoever to the patients whose\ncare we are entrusted with.\nIf this is the case, I would like\nto ask why we give up six years of\nour life training to become doc-tors, when we could do another\ndegree lasting, say four years, and\ncome out of it driving faster cars,\nwearing nicer clothes, and generally earning more money than\nwe will do when we graduate as\ndoctors?\nAssuming that Miss Pattni is a\nthird year medic herself, she will\nhave by now completed about\neight weeks of clinical training. I\nfeel that this is an inadequate period of time in which to cast such\nfar reaching aspersions on an entire profession; in my own clinical\nexperience, I have seen consultants close to tears over the loss of\na patient (incidentally, on the very\nFriday when the original article\nwas published), and have been fortunate enough to work with some\nof the best consultants this medical school has to offer, who have\nworked their hind legs off in their\nrespective field to further enhance\nthe care available to their patients\n(Prof Gazzard et al, pioneers in\nthe field of HIV medicine).\nYes, no one will argue that the\nNHS is in a mess, but this does\nnot mean that the people working within the organisation are\nnot doing their best with the ever-increasingly limited resources\nthey have to work with. On the\ncontrary, I have spoken to at least\none consultant who has gone on\nrecord and publicly denounced\nthe way that the system is heading towards compromising patient care in the press. Tell me; is\nthat the action of a self-obsessed,\ngreedy charlatan?\nNo profession is perfect, and no\none will pretend that medicine is\nany different. There are the occasional bad eggs, and no doubt\nthere are some people at Imperial\nstudying medicine for the wrong\nreasons. I am well aware that\nmedics are not held in the highest regard by many at Imperial,\nbut I hope that people reading\nthis can read past the fact that it\nis written by a medic proud of his\nschool, and see that I am merely\ntrying to illustrate an alternative\nviewpoint.\nI think someone needs to wake\nup and smell the proverbial coffee beans. Banter is part of hospital life. Consultants earn respect\nthrough years of hard work, and\nthey in turn have endured the rib-bings afforded to them by their\nseniors. For what it\u2019s worth, I personally come from a working-class\nfamily, and the reason I am doing\nmedicine is to try and do my bit to\nmake hospitals a less scary place\nto be for all those who I come into\ncontact with.\nMiss Pattni, no one is holding a\nknife to your throat forcing you to\nstay in medicine. If it\u2019s not what\nyou expected and you are not\nenjoying it, then leave, you know\nwhere the door is.\nI hope that over the coming year\nyour experiences and opinions\nchange for the better, but if they\ndon\u2019t then there is little point in\ncontinuing in a system within\nwhich you are not comfortable.\nBelieve me, there are plenty more\npeople waiting in the wings to fill\nyour boots, and the majority of\nthose will be caring, good-hearted\nindividuals who will also do their\nbest to ensure that whenever they\nare given charge of someone\u2019s\ncare, they will fulfil that duty to\nthe utmost of their ability.\nSorry to knock you off your ped-estal, but we, as a profession, do\ncare.\nYes, I actually do want to be a doctor\npoint that all were in agreement\nover was that time and again by\nvirtually ever single person in\nthat room was that a minister of\ngovernment cannot preach about\nextremism to people whose family they are killing in an illegal\nwar and occupation in Iraq and\nAfghanistan, a new colonial process that is the latest in the history\nof many in the last hundred years.\nLook at the history of virtually any\nnation in the Middle East for the\nlast century and you will find that\nthe number one force for change\nwas foreign interests. Remember,\nin the beginning, Saddam was\nAmerica\u2019s boy against Iran.\nI have to conclude that the highest level of government is deaf,\ndumb and blind to the real reasons\nfor anger. They really do want a\nwar, one where the home population will be bullied into thinking\nwhat the powers that be want you\nto think. So here we are. We know\nwhat is going on. We know we are\nthe brains of tomorrow. Let\u2019s use\nthem to actually do something for\nonce. Event the smallest change\nin the attitudes of others will\nmake an unprecedented impact\nagainst a world engulfed in delusion and murder. Whoever we are,\nwe must do whatever we have in\nour power to stop the madness\nfrom spreading.\nOmar Hashmi\nRyan O\u2019Leary\nM\ny pages this\nweek seem to\nhave an awfully\nserious tone. In\nan attempt to\ncater for those not particularly\ninterested in the loftier issues\nconsidered in other columns\nI\u2019m going to extol the virtues of\ntrading in a weekend clubbing\nin London for somewhere more\nfar-flung.\nI\u2019m sure most of you are aware\nby now that a night on the tiles in\nLondon town can get hideously\nexpensive. Thankfully cheap air\ntravel provides a solution. I now\nreckon it\u2019s far more cost effective to fly away after lectures on\nFriday for a weekend of carnage\nin a city that\u2019s not quite as big a\nrip off as this fair town. Ubercheapness seems to be most\nplentiful in Eastern Europe and\ncloser to home, well, anywhere\nnorth of Newcastle.\nThe obvious downside is that\nyou won\u2019t be treated to any big\nname DJ\u2019s but you do have the\nadded novelty factors of going\nsomewhere new, mostly the\nmany different types of people\nyou just don\u2019t get in London.\nTake Glasgow for instance.\nAside from it\u2019s reputation for\ndrunken violence a friend reliably informs me that a certain\nsection of the female population\nnow begin their Saturday night\nout an hour earlier so they can\nsqueeze (take this literally) in\nan extra takeaway between the\npub and the nightclub. Isn\u2019t that\nsplendid? Drink a skinfull, eat\na kebab, attempt to dance off\nthe kebab in some god-forsaken\nsweaty club then replenish your\nenergy levels with a smoked\nsausage supper. I hate to think\nwhat Jamie Oliver would think\nof this rather dubious way of\nspending your leisure time. And\npeople still wonder why parts\nof Glasgow now have lower life\nexpectancy than the Gaza Strip?\nThe entertainment value of this\nspectacle of gluttony is almost\nworth the trip itself. You could\nsum it up in the following man-ner: return flight \u00a350, 2 nights on\nthe lash \u00a380, seeing two women\nwrestling over the last pickled\nonion\u2026 priceless!\nThis might not sound like your\ncup of tea but I do recommend\nyou try and sample some nightlife outside of London. You\u2019ll save\na bit of cash and then perhaps\nnext time you go out here you\u2019ll\ncomplain less about the prices.\nGet on\nthe lash\nStephen Brown\nComment Editor\n\u201cWe must do\nwhatever we\nhave in our\npower to stop\nthe madness\nfrom spreading.\u201d\n\u201cSorry to knock\nyou off your\npedestal, but we,\nas a profession,\ndo care.\u201d\n12 felix Friday 20 October 2006\nomment&\nOpinion\nC\n\n"

    "content": "Canoes in the Alps\nThe eagerly anticipated canoe club\ntrip to the North Alps had finally got\nunderway, starting with the minor\nhiccup of leaving a boat behind and\none of the cars missing the ferry.\nWe arrived in Kitzbuehel in Northern Austria the following afternoon\nand set up camp in an extremely\npicturesque site. The next day\u2019s\npaddling was debated around our\nfirst barbeque of the trip.\nThe Wies and Pinegg Gorges on\nthe Brandenberger river were decided on as a suitable first river. For\nme, and many others, this would be\nthe first Alpine and warm weather\npaddlingexperience.Thevalleywas\nbeautiful and the glorious sunshine\nwas a real novelty. The river was a\ngentle affair with a couple of more\nsignificant rapids resulting in just\nthe odd swim. Back at the campsite\nwe all tucked into pizza and a few\n\u2018steins\u2019 to start Harry off on his epic\nfortnight of beer consumption.\nNext day we were back at the\nBrandenberger for a further section of this river. Again, this was a\ngentle run with a couple of more\ninteresting rapids which resulted\nin a number of swims from the less\nexperienced. Patrick was due to fly\ninto Salzburg later that afternoon,\nfresh from his trip to Norway, so a\ngirly contingent headed off for an\nafternoon\u2019s sightseeing, ice-cream\neating and to provide Patrick with a\nsuitable welcome. The trip started\nbadly for him though; we got back to\nthe campsite to find everyone had\neaten our dinner, having got lost\nand picked up a speeding ticket.\nWe then headed across the border to stay in Mittenwald in Bavaria\nwhere we found a more natural\ncampsite on the river\u2019s edge to get\nour campfire building off to a good\nstart. Boats proved particularly\nuseful for this given that most of\nthe available wood was on the opposite bank! In the three days we\nstayed here, the Rissbach, Loisach\nand Upper Isar were paddled; all\nlow volume grade 3, which resulted\nin only a handful of swims amongst\nthe group. This was also the scene\nof the biggest disaster of the trip \u2013\nHarry dropping the barbeque in the\nriver \u2013 were we all going to starve?\nThe next destination on our itinerary was Landeck \u2013 the focus of\nthe Austrian kayaking scene, and\nfortunately also home to a shop\nselling barbeques. Dominated by\nthe mighty Inn, this was the biggest volume water many of us had\nencountered and required a bit of\ngetting used to.\nRecent floods in the area have\nchangedtheriversdramaticallyand\nseveral of the \u2018classics\u2019 had been\ncanalised, making them somewhat\nhairier. First up was the Rosanna,\na classic grade 3, followed by the\ncommercially-rafted Imst Gorge \u2013\npart of the Inn.\nAt 250 cumecs, this river was\nhuge and full of big, bouncy wave\ntrains which were immensely entertaining for the whole group.\nSwims on this kind of water were\ncertainly trickier to handle, with\npeople and kit taking somewhat\nlonger to recover, keeping the more\nexperienced members of the group\noccupied. There were some sig-Sophie Gore\nnificantly harder rivers here for the\n\u2018big boys\u2019 with the Sanna, T\u00f6sens.\nLower Oetz, and infamous Inn\nShoot being ticked off by some. Our\nfinal move of the trip led us up the\nInn valley into the Engadine area of\nSwitzerland. We spent the final few\ndays of the trip paddling various\nsections of the upper reaches of the\nInn. S-Chanfs and the Brail Gorge\nproved somewhat low on water,\nwhilst Giarsuns and Ardez Gorge\ngave a welcome challenge to the\nbrave few. The final section we pad-dled, the Schuls, proved to be one\nof the most challenging paddled by\nthe whole group with some pretty\ntricky grade 4 rapids claiming one\nor two victims amongst the group.\nSo ended a thoroughly enjoyable\ntrip, a great learning experience for\nthose on their first Alps trip. Much\nbeer was consumed and many rivers paddled. We are extremely\ngrateful to Claire for her excellent\nwork in organising the trip.\nAnyone interested in joining us\non our next summer tour should\ncontact the club, via patrick.\nclissold@imperial.ac.uk.

    "content": "14 felix Friday 20 October 2006\nGLOBALLY SPEAKING environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\u201cWhat do I do,\u201d asked Dr Vineeta\nGupta, an Indian physician working in Punjab, \u201cwhen a 40-year-old\nwoman with learning disability and\nbitemarksacrossherbodypresents\nto me with HIV because she was\nraped by her father as a child? Do I\noffer her condoms? Encourage her\nto be faithful? To be abstinent?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do I do,\u201d she asks again,\n\u201cwhen a 14-year-old sex worker in\nMumbai tests HIV positive, having been sold to a brothel at the\nage of 9? Do I say to her it was her\nchoice?\u201d\nDr Gupta argues that the current response to tackling HIV is\ninsufficient, even harmful. This was\nhardly the line touted at the XVIth\nInternational AIDS conference in\nToronto, in celebration of the renewed resources for the struggle\ntoward universal treatment.\nAny newcomer to the pandemic\ncould be forgiven for presuming\nRichard Gere, Gates, Clinton et al.\nmight as well have discovered the\nHIV pathogen themselves, given\nthe airtime they received. Those\nmost implicated by these discus-sions, those with HIV themselves,\nwere only noticed by their absence\non the main stage.\nThere was, however, one plat-form, courtesy of The Lancet medical journal, aboard a boat on Lake\nOntario \u2013 perhaps a necessary freelance for a message that in contrast\nleft no slack for complacency. Those\non that boat heard from grassroots\ninitiatives \u2013 those with HIV and\nOlly Todd\nMedsin\nScaling up of HIV/AIDS treatment\nThe world of scientific ethics is un-predictable, argumentative, and\nalways, always relevant. Wednesday\u2019s meeting of Imperial College\u2019s\nstudent Pugwash society exemplified all these qualities.\nThe speakers were to be Professor Peter Zimmerman, professor of\nScience and Security at King\u2019s College Department of War Studies,\nand Dr Rebecca Johnson, Executive Director of the Acronym institute for Disarmament Diplomacy.\n\u201cWeapons in Space\u201d was the topic\nup for debate, on the arsenal of satellites that may soon be surrounding the Earth. But as things turned\nout, these potential superweapons\nwere overshadowed by events at\nground level, as on Monday, North\nKorea detonated what they claim to\nhave been a nuclear device.\nThe two speakers were inundated\nwith requests for comment on the\nNorth Korea situation from national and international news channels,\nand Dr Johnson was unable to take\npart in our discussion. However,\nProf. Zimmerman, who has previously served as Chief Scientist at\nthe U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, kindly made time\nin his hectic schedule to explain to\nSarah Hyland\nPugwash Imperial\nScientific ethics with IC Pugwash\n\u25a0 Women interviewed in\nMumbai would rather risk\ntheir own health in marriage\nthan the financial risk of being\noutside of marriage.\n\u25a0 60-85% of women in SubSaharan Africa contract HIV by\ntheir husbands.\n\u25a0 90% of females with HIV\nin India were virgins pre-marriage and remain faithful.\nworking with HIV directly in India\nand sub-Saharan Africa.\nEducation is constantly being\ntouted as the answer but what effect\ndoes it have for woman who have\nno choice? Consequently, education\nmust be about empowerment, not\njust cucumbers and condoms.\nWhat does education do for these\nwomen who have no choice? What\nchoice is there for them amongst\nabstinence, being careful (mar-riage), and contraception? No such\nsimple mantra can hope to break\nthe restrictions of liberty that disable women in these countries from\nagency for their own health.\nHIV thrives in the thick of a complex knot of problems. It is irrefu-tably a shameful situation in our\nworld today, where 38 million live\nwith a debilitating and fatal illness\nsimply because they cannot afford\ntreatment. Our only experience of\nfighting HIV successfully comes\nfrom the sterile laboratory conditions of the wealthy west. The risk\nof interventions worsening inequal-ity, and the risk of losing current\ndrug artillery to resistance, cannot\nbe underestimated.\nWhy is it only on Northern soil\nthat we entertain a bottom-up approach to eradicating disease that\nis community-specific, and patient-centred? What excuse can be found\nfor not offering the holistic medicine we consider necessary to those\nacross our national borders?\nDavid Barr, a long-term treatment\nadvocate and educator, argues that\nlack of resources is not the problem.\nNor is it a lack of interaction from\nNorthern Rich to Southern Poor.\nThere is such interaction on a\nmassive scale but it is tied to \u201cprofit, market development, war, and\narms procurement\u201d. The U.S. will\nspend $1 trillion of its $2.25 trillion\ntotal government outlay in 2007 on\nwar while international develop-Could increasing the incidence of resistance do more harm than good by making drug therapy useless?\nThe possible detonation of a nuclear weapon in North Korea is cause for concern\naround the world together, Pugwash can search for peaceful solutions to conflicts. As many Pugwash members hold positions as\nadvisors to governments, the ideas\nformed through the discussions\nand conferences can quickly find\ntheir way into international policy.\nThe organisation\u2019s influence was\nacknowledged in 1995, when it was\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\nInternational Student/Young Pugwash encourages students to think\nbeyond the facts and concepts of\nscientificstudy,andconsideritsrea-sons and implications. The Imperial\nCollege branch organises talks and\ndebates with leading scientists in\norder to raise awareness of important issues, and holds a yearly exhibition of ethical careers, demonstrating how scientific knowledge\ncan be responsibly applied.\nWe will be rescheduling our\nplanned \u201cWeapons in Space\u201d debate\nto later this term, and delve further\ninto the politics of North Korean\nnuclear testing. There is also an\ninformal session on the history and\nfoundations of Pugwash on the 1st\nof November, chaired by Pugwash\nhistorian Sandy Butcher, which will\nbe an excellent introduction to the\norganisation for anyone interested\nin the ethical implications of being\na scientist.\nwould not be productive within the\nevening\u2019s setting. Those with opinions on U.S. nuclear policy will have\nto wait for future meetings to air\ntheir views. In discussing the testing of nuclear weapons Pugwash\nis returning to its roots. The international Pugwash Conferences on\nScience and World Affairs began in\n1957, when the scientific community was coming to terms with the\nshocking reality of the atomic bomb.\nToday, Pugwash considers the ethical aspects and global impacts of all\nareas of science, from agricultural\nbiotechnology to the distribution\nof HIV medication, though the prevention of armed conflict takes top\npriority.\nBy bringing scientists from\nThe 4th Pugwash Workshop on Stbility, Security and Cooperation in\nNortheast Asia, 2005, Beijing, China\nus precisely what we know about\nthe event in North Korea.\nHe focused on the facts, analysing\nthe earthquake to reveal the size of\nthe bomb, and concluded that, if indeed nuclear, it was \u2018the worst first\ntest in history.\u2019 Whether this is reassuring or terrifying is up to us to\ndecide.\nHe also speculated as to the current state of North Korea\u2019s nuclear\narsenal, pointing out that nobody\nwastes a bomb on a test unless\nthey have several more to spare.\nAlthough he describes himself as a\n\u201cDemocrat in exile\u201d, Prof. Zimmerman preferred not to discuss the\nU.S. nuclear arsenal. When interrupted with questions, he explained\nthat such ideological arguments\nA single red stick figure indicates 50,000 people living with HIV/AIDs in each of the continents\nDid you\nknow?\nment contributions from the richest countries in the world average\nat just 0.22% of their GDP\n.\nThis discussion comes to Imperial in the form of a Perspectives\nnight at 6.30 p.m. in the biology lecture theatre, SAF Building, on 24th\nOctober, with nibbles provided.

Examples of the\ncomplaints were cited, such as a\nlack of a major bank stall for overseas students to open an account,\na lack of organisation for commercial stalls as they arrived, and a bad\nstall layout. They quoted an anonymous source as saying that UWSU\nis running at a \u00a310,000 deficit, and\nthat personal rivalries between the\nsabbs have been hampering opera-The student newspaper\nof Imperial College\nNo. 1,360 \u2022 Friday \u2022\n20 October 2006 \u2022\nfelixonline.co.uk\nfelix\nfelix\nAndy Sykes\nEditor-in-Chief\npage\npage\ntions, with the President, Salima\nLanquaye, apparently telling the\nother officers that she could handle the bulk of the arrangements\nherself.\nThe UWSU General Manager, the\nhead of the union staff, apparently\nfiled an official complaint against\nRayhan Rafiq Omar, the VP Communications, for allowing the issue to go to print. It is not clear\nwhat the sabbs felt was inaccurate\nabout the article, though they issued an immediate ban and began\nremoving the paper from its distribution points and readers\u2019 hands.\nMr Omar, understandably furious,\ncommented to Felix: \u201cI\u2019ve never\nseen them do so much work.\u201d The\nsabbs have also tabled a motion of\nno confidence in Mr Omar.\nThe General Manager summoned Mr Omar to a disciplinary\npanel meeting. However, this took\nplace via text message sent at\n10:15am, with the meeting occurring at 12:30pm the same day. Mr\nOmar was unable to attend to at-tend, due to prior commitments,\nand the meeting took place without\nhim present. However, the sabbs\neventually decided that it was not\nappropriate to discipline Mr Omar\nwithout him being present, and\nagreed to reconvene in a fortnight\u2019s\ntime.\nMr Omar, contacted by this reporter for comment, feels very\nstrongly about honouring his word\nto the students that he serves. After\nthe sabbs decided that they would\ndeliberate on his case without him,\nhe stated: \u201cMy responsibility is to\nthe students, not myself\u201d, adding\nthat he could continue to help students after being disciplined.\nThe Smoke is independent from\nthe UWSU in terms of content, and\nfunded by the union. Mr Omar and\nthe other sabbs took decisions at\nthe beginning of the year to make\nit fully independent of any political\ninfighting within the union, and as\nsuch, the only body that can remove\nMr Omar from his post is the General Meeting.\nMr Omar controls the funding of\nthe newspaper, and although he\nhas a right to change content, he\nfeels his role to be more of a guiding\none, saying: \u201cAs long as I am in the\npost, I will protect the students who\nwrite for The Smoke, and ensure\nwhat they are doing\u2026 can be published.\u201d This reporter contacted the\nUWSU President for comment; at\nthe time of going to press, no reply\nhas been received.\nIn other news, Felix\u2019s previous\nnews editor, Chris Miles, has succeeded in irritating the sabbs at\nBristol University, after asking\nquestions about the finances of\nthe Union in his new role as news\neditor of university\u2019s student news-paper. The sabbs have threatened\nthe paper, Epigram, with withdrawl\nof funding and closure, and possible removal of Mr Miles from his\nposition.\nMassive outrage as\nnothing happens\nA huge group of students and staff\ngathered on campus yesterday,\nas it was revealed that absolutely\nnothing had happened during the\nweek. The gathering protested by\ngoing about their daily business as\nif nothing had happened, which is in\nfact what had happened. You see?\nFelix has assembled a special reporting team, the Felix Undercover\nInvestigation Team, or FUCIT for\nshort, to try to get to the bottom of\nthis outrageous farce. This loose assembly of tireless men and women\nof journalism scoured the campus\nfrom the broad, slightly blinding\nwhite space of Dalby Court to the\nlofty heights of the sabbs\u2019 offices\nin Beit Towers, trying to locate an\nanswer for you, dear reader, to the\neternal question: \u201cWhat the fuck\nare we going to put on the front\npage?\u201d\nInitially,FUCITtoyedwiththeidea\nof filling the page with lorem ipsum\nand knocking off early to the pub for\na few swift lagers and a stomach-destroying Union chilli-with-nach-os, but this plan was scuppered by\na rather angry editor wielding what\nhe likes to call his \u201cangry stick\u201d and\nthreatening everything from fractures to forcible orifice insertion.\nEjected from the Felix office by the\neditor\u2019s lackeys, FUCIT decided\nthe next best course of action would\nbe to wander up to Beit Towers and\nsee if they could steal anything\nfrom the photocopiers that might\nbe horribly incriminating. Sadly, all\nthe team located was a photocopy\nof some unidentified body parts\ncovered with hair, and a copy of the\nGovernance Report autographed\nby the Union President, John Collins. They did bump into a certain\nonline newspaper editor along the\nway, who could be heard yelling,\nrather angrily, \u201cwhy won\u2019t you lot\nmake a mistake?\u201d\nFUCIT, that bastion of journalistic\nintegrity, tried to obtain comment\nfrom the sabbs. Eric Lai, Deputy\nPresident (Cakes & Snacks) was\nunavailable for comment, as he\nwas wandering the halls questioning passers-by: \u201cDoes anyone\nknow how to get the Internet on my\nphone?\u201d\nBen Harris, Deputy President\n(Fluff & Stuff), initially displayed reluctance to talk to FUCIT, but then\ndarkly muttered something about\n\u201cULU.. damn journalists.. NUS..\u201d\nbefore collapsing into a immobile\nheap. Jon Matthews, Deputy President (Pounds & Pennies), used his\ncomment-making machine to say:\n\u201cIt would not be appropriate for me\nto make comment at this juncture.\u201d\nSir John Collins (Punion Resident)\nofficially refused to make comment,\nbefore adding under his breath:\n\u201cOff the record, old chap, but being\nPresident is a fine old lark.\u201d Shama\nRahman, Deputy President (Girl\u2019s\nStuff), unfortunately could not hear\nFUCIT knocking on her door, as the\nvolume of her modern beat combo\nmusic was sufficient to vibrate\nnearby fixtures.\nWhen asked for comment by FUCIT, Andy Sykes, Felix Editor, said:\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing back in\nhere? I thought I told you go make\nup news. Here comes the pain!\u201d\nIf something\u2019s happening, they\u2019re damn good at hiding it from us\nThe issue of Smoke that upset the sabbs and union staff\nFUCIT\nAre chimps\npeople too?\nScience\n6\npage\nFairground\nScience\n\n"

    "content": "had been a feature of life since the late\nforties, and even those for whom this\nwas not a lifetime had lived through\nthe second world war even before that.\nSo why, then, was the longest period\nin which Britain was not at direct risk\nof becoming a battlefield since 1939 so\nunderappreciated?\nThe obvious answer would be that the\nBritish public are innately ungrateful.\nIf my articles of previous weeks have\nmade but one point (which I daresay\nsome will contest) it is that the obvious\nanswer is, by and large, wrong. That is\nnot to deny that many are indeed dyed-in-the-wool ingrates, as anyone stepping aside to let someone onto the tube\nahead of them can attest, and I do not\ndeny that it may be a significant factor.\nOf greater significance, however, is the\nvery fact that the public had become so\nused to the paranoia \u2013 why be grateful\nfor the removal of something which you\nonly notice once it has gone?\nPerhaps it goes beyond that, also \u2013\nperhaps some actively resented such\na shift in values. Perhaps some had felt\nthe sense of fear as a safety blanket\nof sorts, which is not as perverse as it\nmight seem, given the age-old British\nobsession with stoicism. If anything, the\nracial tensions underlying the current\nstate of affairs serve to further such\nfeelings amongst those who hold them\n(albeit depending on their skin colour)\nsince the measures drawn up to combat\nthe current threat will not affect them\nadversely, so can only prove to protect\nthem from the threat whose presence\nthey cherish.\nThough, of course, you would be hard\npressed to find anyone who would state\noutright that they wish to live in fear,\nwhich shows either that people are not\nconscious of this feeling or that I am\ntalking nonsense. I believe it to be the\nformer, but I would not begrudge anyone to disagree.\nWielding the\nmighty organ\nI\n\u2019ve decided to adopt a moralising tone, having\nspent the last week boring those within earshot\nof me with my slightly (okay, maybe more than\nslightly) pedantic rants on various political and\neconomic events, as well as offended a good proportion of people who were on a number 52 bus with me\nthe other evening as I drunkenly shouted expletives and\nquestioned the legitimacy of birth of certain BBC news\nreporters. You may have noticed recently that the world\nseems to have gone insane. This is in fact normal and\nnothing to be worried about. However, the level of insanity appears to be increasing exponentially. For instance,\nthis whole Muslim veil row. While I will support your\nright to think and say what the hell you want until you\nprise the final martini out of my stiffening and rapidly\ncooling fingers, I will not stand for any religious icons,\ndress or teaching in publicly-funded schools. I don\u2019t care\nwhether you wear a veil, a burkha, a huge mahogany\ncross or whatever the Jewish hat thing is called outside\nof the classroom; inside the classroom, these things\nhave absolutely no place.\nI\u2019m sure the above paragraph will have me in trouble\nwith Muslims, woolly-minded Guardian-reading liberals,\nand probably a few Christians as well, so I\u2019ll add a small\ndisclaimer: I\u2019m not an Islamophobe, a Christianophobe,\nor any other phobe. If the row had been that a teacher\u2019s\ncrucifix had scared the children, I would not phrase my\nargument any differently: religion has no place inside\npublicly-funded schools. These schools should be the\none place that is free from political or cultural colour-ing; in practice, of course, they aren\u2019t, but I welcome any\nstep that takes us closer to this ideal.\nBy now, of course, you\u2019ve realised an atheist. I\u2019d go\nas far as to label myself one of those Bertrand Russellreading, Tom Paine-loving anti-religionists. Again, I will\nsupport your right to be religious, to read scripture, to\npractice whatever traditions you see fit despite being an\natheist; I fervently believe that my personal belief system should not be forced upon another, and would hope\nthat others would do the same.\nMy second \u201cthe world is utterly bonkers, I mean, walking-around-smeared-in-excrement-bonkers\u201d argument\nlies with the ridiculousness occurring at various student\nnewspapers. It seems slight criticism of authority brings\na vastly disproportionate response. Our old news editor,\nChris Miles, had the audacity of questioning the sabbs at\nBristol University\u2019s Union, where he now works for their\nnewspaper, and the Union responded by trying to shut\ndown the newspaper by removing funding. This is only\na single example of a very dangerous trend (cf. London\nStudent, Roar). If you are elected to any public office,\nyou should expect scrutiny. You must be open and hon-est. Doing so will gain you the respect of journalists, who\nmay in return cut you some slack when you need it.\nThawing the cold war\nA\ns with presumably everyone reading this, I was\nborn during the cold war.\nUnlike some, however, I\nhave no real memories of\nthe time \u2013 in fact, my first memory of\nany events outside my domestic sphere\nwas watching the news of the fall of the\nBerlin wall when I was four years old.\nAlthough I remember little before then\n(and, if truth be told, little of the rest of\nmy life), I was fortunate enough to be\nsufficiently aware of the political situation to understand the significance of\nthe event. Further to that, I was aware\nof the change in people\u2019s mindset over\nthe following years \u2013 in this post-war\nday and age, there was no longer the\nDamoclean bomb and the paranoia that\ncame with it, though the sense of relief\nthat might have been expected was, at\nbest, short-lived.\nSince we are now in a situation where\nthe Western world is once again in the\nmidst of a war against a threat from the\nEast where at any moment we might all\nbe blown apart and, once again, there\nis an almost palpable sense of paranoia\namongst the populace, it seems remarkable that, between 1991 and 2001, the\npublic mood was not in some way more\nebullient. After all, the climate of fear\nHugh Stickley-Mansfield asks whether we really appreciate the\npeaceful society in which we live or are we all just very ungrateful\n\u201cMy first memory\nof any events\noutside my\ndomestic sphere\nwas watching the\nnews of the fall of\nthe Berlin wall\u201d\nW\nardening is a team ef-fort. Over the last couple of weeks the whole\nLinstead Wardening\nTeam, Hall manager,\nand Hall Seniors have all been working\nreally hard to ensure that the Linstead\nstudents are settling down well into\nhall, are meeting people and enjoying\nthemselves. I\u2019m really proud at the way\nthat everyone has worked together to\ncreate a superb hall atmosphere.\nAlready we\u2019ve had lots of events over\nthe last few weeks in order to help people meet each other. As part of this we\nhave had a series of \u201cMeet the Wardens\u201d parties held in my flat in Linstead\nat which groups of the new students can\nget to meet all of the wardening team\nin a comfortable and relaxed environ-ment. Linstead has 188 students so they\ndon\u2019t fit into my flat all at once! Hence,\nwe have a series of five parties, and we\nselect people from different parts of hall\nso that they get a chance to meet people\nwho aren\u2019t their next door neighbours.\nOne of the big events of the year in\nLinstead is the \u201cComing up dinner\u201d\nand this was held last night in a local\nSouth Kensington Hotel. As you can see\nabove the whole wardening team attends along with the hall manager and\nthe youngest member of the hall \u2013 three\nyear old Zara (my daughter)! It\u2019s an opportunity to really dress up and enjoy a\nWardening the almighty organ\ngood atmosphere with great food and\nentertainment. This dinner takes quite\na bit of planning from the wardening\nteam \u2013 selecting the venue; negotiating\nthe price; arranging for decorations;\nselling tickets; planning the menu; arranging entertainment; and arranging\nfor drinks in the Hall beforehand. Then\n\u2018counting them out\u2019 and \u2018counting them\nall back in\u2019. A few of the students were a\nbit \u2018worse for wear\u2019 after the event and\nwe checked on them overnight to make\nsure they were OK. It\u2019s all worthwhile\nas it\u2019s a great event which brings everyone together. It also gives us a chance\nto toast the \u2018Anonymous Benefactor\u2019 \u2013\nthe person who donated the money to\nbuild Linstead Hall \u2013 it\u2019s an enduring\nmystery to us all who this person is\u2026\nOur next big event is the Linstead\nHall trip to Bruges. This involves a\n5:00am start (do you stay up all night\nor risk sleeping in\u2026?). Each year we\nhave to go and wake up some poor students who forgot to set their alarms!\nThe coach arrives at Dover a few hours\nlater and once on the ferry we all have\nthe chance to enjoy a good fry-up break-fast. Just few hours later we arrive at\nthe ancient city of Bruges. We hand out\nmaps to everyone and Imperial College\ndescends on Bruges en masse. (130 people are set to go this year). People have\na great time as there is lots to see in\nthis historic city \u2013 for example you can\ntake a boat trip; visit a museum; or even\nstuff yourself silly with famous Belgium\nchocolate. On our way back home we\ncall in at a Hypermarket where everyone stocks up on their favourite French\nand Belgium products \u2013 both liquid and\nsolid! We arrive back at College at about\n23:00. Everyone has to drag themselves,\nand all their shopping off the coach and\ninto the hall \u2013 probably the most difficult part of the whole trip.\nWardening is a fun but demanding\nrole. You have to be prepared to organize your life around the Hall, but in return you get to meet many interesting\nand enthusiastic people and make a difference to their life at Imperial.\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.

    "content": "Manifestos For Union Autumn Elections 2006\nEqual Opportunities Officer 1 Position\nSyed Junaid\nNo manifesto submitted...\nThomas Brodrick\nThe American writer Laurence Peters once said \u201cequal opportunity means everyone will have a fair chance at being incompetent.\u201d This quote best sums up why I am standing for\nthe position of the ICU Equal Opportunities O\ufb03cer. It\u02bcs not because certain groups deserve a head-start over others in life (in what some refer to as \u02bbpositive discrimination\u02bc), but\nbecause everyone really is the same underneath it all. One human being can succeed, or fall short, in the same way any other can.\nAs Equal Opportunities O\ufb03cer, I would ensure that ICU facilities, clubs, societies and other opportunities involving union life stay accessible to everybody. I would also support\nevents that help to promote equal opportunities in the college.\nMost of all, I want Imperial to remain the diverse and welcoming place that it currently is; in a truly equal environment, anyone can achieve greatness.\nCouncillors: Undergraduate Engineering 4 Positions\nEdo Abraham\nHey to all you Engineers. I hope you are enjoying the new academic year so far, and that it will be a year of fun and success for you all. I am Edo Abraham - a 3rd Year EEE student\non an MEng course. I would like to tell you that I will do more than just attend all the council meetings and vote on issues key to your experience at IC. I will also make sure that\nyour ideas, concerns and expectations are heard at the meetings. I know I have the genuine interest, the discipline, competence and motivation to follow through my promises.\nSo go on\u2026let\u02bcs make a better Union Council, and vote for Edo! - enjoy the rest of the year.\nJoao Serra\nNo manifesto submitted...\nNicholas Simpson\nNo manifesto submitted...\nSteven King\nNo manifesto submitted...\nYanyan Huang\nNo manifesto submitted...\nCouncillors: Postgraduate Engineering 2 Positions\nAshley Brown\nWith both the college and the union looking for better postgraduate representation it is important for us to make our views known. Whilst undergraduates can understand many of\nthe issues unique to postgrads, they often do not hear of them. Strong postgraduate representation is important, particularly with a growing number of postgrads engaging with\nunion.\nI don\u02bct avoid di\ufb03cult questions or tolerate weak answers and demonstrated this last year. I\u02bcve now been at Imperial as an undergrad for 4 years and postgrad for 1 year, so am well\naware of the vast assortment of problems met by both groups. More importantly, I know the ways to resolve them.\nVote me to have your concerns voiced and interests taken into account.\nCouncillors: Undergraduate Natural Sciences 4 Positions\nDerek Wan\nIn an environment where student issues inevitably a\ufb00ect you, your opinions maybe all you have to count on. But when some voices are louder than others, how do you make sure\nyou get heard? Your best bet is to vote for someone who can and will make that happen! My promise is an unselective, professional student representation. Please vote con\ufb01dently\nfor me as I have served the Council last year and possess further experience from other student processes. Voting for me is voting for a better student body. Thanks all!\nZhibing Hu\nNo manifest submitted\nCouncillors: Postgraduate Natural Sciences 1 Position\nAlex Guite\nIt\u02bcs a time of immense change in Imperial College Union: withdrawal from the University of London Union, a make or break year for the new Graduate Students\u02bc Association, a\nradical Governance Review about to be implemented and a Union Building refurbishment which must have at its heart a commitment to sustainable design.\nNow more than ever, Union Council must be more than a talking shop. I have experience which spans the Union, from setting up and chairing societies to leading a Faculty\nUnion. As an Ordinary Member of Council last year I took a lead on opposing the College\u02bcs crazy dress code, fought to keep the Queen\u02bcs Lawn free of portakabins when College\nmanagement tried to sneak it past us during Easter and I lead the campaign to ban smoking from the Union Building.\nIf you elect me I pledge to be an open and approachable advocate of your views.\nCouncillors: Non Faculty 1 Position\nAndy Sykes\nI\u02bcm standing for this position in order to get a vote on Council. At the moment, I have no say whatsoever in the governing bodies of the Union. I can write about it, I can attempt to\nhold the Union and the Sabbs to account for what they do, but I cannot change it. Vote for me over RON to see a Felix Editor sit on Council.\n\n"

    "content": "G\nood afternoon, my\nnocturnal friends,\nand welcome to another nightlife page,\nwith an actual review\nthis week so I know at least one of\nyou has been going out. Personally, I have been recovering from\na week of fun and games with my\nImperial College society of choice:\nthe Alternative Music Society\n(AMS).\nPresided over from afar by our\nfavourite supreme nightlife editor\nGreg, the AMS strives to improve\nthe lives of poor lonely Freshers\nwith better taste in music than\nis good for them. Having been a\nmember since I was a first year, I\nhave seen the society rise from the\nprimordial sludge and evolve into\na thriving social network. Never\noverburdened with members, the\nsociety provides an opportunity to\nmeet people with similar musical\ntastes and learn about different\ntypes of music, as well as just generally having a very nice time.\nOn that note, I will conclude this\ncolumn by strongly recommending the AMS\u2019s own Kids Will Be\nSkeletons gig night at the union\non Saturday 21st October, where\nyou will hear lots of sumptuous\nand delicious music flowing into\nyour ears from real live bands.\nAlex Baldwin\nNightlife Editor\nHard house at The Fridge\nInsekt\u2019s second birthday at The Fridge brings out the clubbing masses in full force\nIt must have taken a pretty inspiring line-up to encourage myself\nand the other few remaining survivors of the Tidy Weekender 10\n(held only the previous weekend)\nout just 4 days after the 3 day hard\nhouse overdose we experienced\nup in Wales. Those able bodies\nwho hadn\u2019t enjoyed the fun of Tidy\nneeded little persuading.

Previously a\nmonthly event held at Fire Club,\nVauxhall, Insekt events are less frequent now due to losing residency\nthere, but the masses came out in\nfull force to celebrate Insekt\u2019s second birthday.\nDontstayin.com gave away a few\ncoveted tickets in their competition,\nbut I\u2019m sure all who paid the fifteen\npounds for entry would agree that it\nwas money well spent; I tried not to\nlook too smug as I walked in (plus\none) for free! The Fridge\u2019s location,\nfortunately, somewhat exempted it\nfrom steep London drinks prices:\nthree pounds for a beer in comparison to anything from four pounds\nto six pounds in Central London.\nFollowing a raid back in April, The\nFridge has since under gone a re-furbishment. Although it has lost a\nbit of that grimy feel which used to\nadd a special something to a night\nout, it still managed to match the\nstyle of the music excellently: we\ncame for a bit of filth and that\u2019s\nwhat we received!\nArriving at around eleven thirty,\nwe did not have to queue at all but\nentered to find the place pretty\nfull, yet with a reasonable amount\nof space for an hour or so for some\nhigh energy dancing to kick start\nour evening. The crowd was no\nwhere near as mixed as usual: next\nto no cybers, mainly 20s/30s, all very\nfriendly. James Nardi initiated our\nnight with some full on hard techy\nhouse to get the excitement up. Defective Audio\u2019s live PA left no one\ndisappointed, especially the male\nclientele who got to gaze upon the\nscantily clad dancers on stage! Having nearly exhausted what energy I\nhad in me I was ready to flake had it\nnot been for the excellent timing of\nKarim\u2019s 3am set. The ferocity with\nwhich he lashed out the tunes was\nelectric and had everyone on their\nfeet by the time \u201cHave Faith\u201d was\nplayed.\nThe Electro room, hosted by Toomuchbutneverenough.com, added\nan alternative interlude to the fast\npaced music of the main room, to\nthose after a chill out on the comfy\nleather sofas. Eduardo Herrera\nplayed out some excellent filthy\ntechno for those of us wanting to\nkeep on our feet to a slower yet still\nheavy beat. The \u2018Ice Box\u2019 room was\nrelatively empty, which was sometimes a welcome change from the\nbusy crowd in the main arena. Living up to its name, The Fridge never\nbecame overheated at all. Quite the\ncontrary, the air conditioning provided relief for those sending their\ntemperatures soaring all night. Too\noften a night is spoiled if the venue\nis stifling.\nBack in the main arena, once Karim had ended a particularly satisfactory set, it was time for Paul\nGlazby back to back with Justin\nBourne. Although enjoying a practically perfect concluding set from\nGlazby the week before, he still\nmanaged to top his prior perform-ance. The pounding filthy beats\ncame on relentlessly leaving no opportunity for a break! Although by\nMarc Johnson\u2019s culminating set\nthe club\u2019s numbers had dwindled,\nthose remaining gave it their all.\nThe brave stayed on for the free\nafter party whilst us Tidy veterans\nheaded home, completely spent but\nin the knowledge we had enjoyed a\nblindingly good night!\nCaz Knight\nInsekt\u2019s 2nd Birthday\nThe Fridge\nHHHHI\nJAMES FINCH\nThis man is probably much friendlier than he looks.\nPure filthy\nhard house for\nyour stomping\npleasure\nFabric has been bringing us a varied array of exciting electronic\nmusic for seven years now and\nthey have decided to stretch the\ndefinition of a weekend to breaking\npoint, with five days of music starting on the 19th of October, so you\u2019ve\nmissed the start already.

    "content": "Robin Hood fails to hit the target\nThe BBC\u2019s latest Saturday night family show takes over from Doctor Who, certainly a tough act to follow\nThe BBC\u2019s latest flagship drama\nRobin Hood rode onto television\nscreens a few weeks ago. Promoted\nwith the channel\u2019s prime time clich\u00e9 as \u201cthe one to watch\u201d, it has set\ncamp in Saturday evening\u2019s family friendly seven o\u2019clock slot. The\nBBC\u2019s advertising bow had been\ntargeted primarily at the Doctor\nWho audience who tuned in at the\nsame time for weeks previously. I\nwasn\u2019t a fan of the time-travelling\ndalek-dueller, so my expectations\nwere cautious but those clever\ntelevision execs also happened to\nbe superb archers. Who\u2019d have\nthought?\nAfter the initial episode I was hesitant to write about the program. To\nmy surprise, it was enjoyable but\nthe splinters in my bum were stinging from sitting on the fence \u2013 I\ncouldn\u2019t decide whether I genuinely\nliked it or not. Robin Hood cantered\nalong quickly enough from scene\nto scene and it was easier to watch\nthan clubbing one of the sheriff\u2019s\nguards over the head with a sword.\nAs a piece of family entertainment,\nthere\u2019s nothing more suitable than\na cheeky protagonist battling the\noppressive ruler whilst pushing the\nmessages of charity and spreading the wealth to the fore of children\u2019s minds. My view was delayed\na week before Robin Hood was\ntrialled again for the dungeon of\ncondemnation.\nThe week passed and as I began\nwatching Jonas Armstrong flex his\nstring bow as Robin of Locksley\nonce again, immediately I sensed\na cauldron of contempt bubbling up\nsomewhere inside of me. The editing was the first thing that riled me.\nSimple shots of Robin\u2019s right hand\nman, Much, turning round were\nchopped together with three different camera angles looking utterly\nstrange.\nIn the final scene of the episode\nTom Roberts\nTV Editor\nRobin improvised using his bow as\na zip line mechanism. The scene\nwas cobbled together with endless\namounts of different shots thus ruining any sense of excitement or,\nmore importantly, danger, as our\nhero hung statically in different positions along the rope zip line. Various shot changes gave the impression Robin was in fact gradually\nmoving back up the rope! One of\nthree things happened here: either\nthe sheriff had a tiny castle (which\nwould also explain why there are\nonly five guards available to fight\nthe peasants in the entire fort!) not\njust with a moat but actually floating\non a water reservoir rocking Robin\nback and forth; or the set was too\nsmall to film an entire shot of this\nextremely high risk manoeuver; or\nthe insurance people wouldn\u2019t pay\nout in case Robin went too fast and\nsmashed through the sheriff\u2019s polystyrene faux granite walls. I haven\u2019t\ngot time to lambaste Robin\u2019s CGI\narrows that magically leave the\nbow and suddenly reappear wherever his invisible telescopic sight\npoints.\nThe appalling editing wouldn\u2019t\nbe such a concern if the camera\ncould focus on more than the very\nsmall handful of locations that\nwere on show. A few straw huts, a\ncastle courtyard, a dingy dungeon\nand the generic Sherwood Forest\nbackground are already as unwel-comingly familiar as the stench of\nsomeone doing a you-know-what\nin public toilets \u2013 hold it till home,\npeople. Usually it\u2019s possible to see\npast technical shortcomings and\nfind salvation in the story and act-ing; after all, high budget television\nhas always lacked the finesse of\ndramatic cinema \u2013 the CGI artists\non Doctor Who braved the TARDIS\nthemselves fetching their animation equipment from the 1980s. But\nonce again, Robin Hood fails miserably when it comes to the players\nand script. Armstrong\u2019s cheeky\nnature soon slips into smugness\nand the audience is left wanting to\nbreak Robin\u2019s ruddy bow over his\nskull. Keith Allen is well cast as\nthe Sheriff but let off the leash and\ndescends into a sarcastic fool who\nnever really feels like he is going\nto prevail against the renowned,\nworshipped and almost holy Robin\nHood. By far the worst character\nis Much. Only ever used as a device for woeful humour that makes\nFriends look original, at one point\nhe charges into a dungeon exclaim-ing: \u201cThis is a rescue! And we are\nundetected!\u201d Cue the sound of\nshouting guards in the background\nand a joke Joey Tribbiani would be\nashamed of. Even more appalling\nscript writing is when a group of\noutlaws are discussing the Sheriff\u2019s ransom clause for capturing\nRobin Hood \u2013 cutting out people\u2019s\ntongues. The outlaw declares that\nit would be funny if \u201cinstead of \u2018the\ncat got your tongue\u2019, \u2018the sheriff got\nyour tongue\u2019\u201d would be a hilarious\nphrase. Some outlaws begin examining their nails for dirt whilst\nothers scan the sky for cloud cov-erage, whilst behind the cameras\nthe crew are probably dying on the\ninside because this script was commissioned when they themselves\ncould have written a better script\nthan this steaming turd on a piece\nof Kleenex.\nIt\u2019s unclear where my epiphany\ncame from regarding this program.\nHaving previously enjoyed it, I\nnow can\u2019t stand to endure it. Once\nI started picking, the bogies soon\nfell out of Robin Hood\u2019s nose. This\njudge\u2019s verdict on Robin Hood? The\ndungeons are out of the question. A\nprompt trip the stocks of disgrace\nfor the actors followed by a severe\nquartering for the editing team\nand a hanging of the script writers\nshould suffice. For the good of all,\nthe rest of the series should be axed\nimmediately.\nJonas Armstrong in Robin Hood: Unfortunately that\u2019s a string bow and not razor wire.\nGordon Ramsey gets a roasting\nLast week I had the pleasure, and\nluckily friends in high places, to see\nHave I Got News For You recorded\nlive. Actually, that\u2019s a lie. I just have\nfriends quicker than Paul Merton\u2019s\ncutting wit when it comes to obtaining extremely high-demand tickets.\nI\u2019ve always enjoyed Have I and\nRamsay\u2019s television programs have\nfeatured numerous times in this\nsection, so when the hard-arsed\nchef\u2019s name was called out along\nwith Peter Serafinowicz of comedy\nLook Around You fame, I was feeling pleased at the prospect of an\nentertaining evening with a panel I\nrespected.\nBefore cameras began rolling,\nRamsay promised the entire audience dinner and wine at Claridge\u2019s\nshould he make six mistakes. Before he\u2019d even finished the introductions the audience members\neach had four eager fingers and a\nthumb raised.\nThe three Michelen star winning\nchef was clearly nervous, fidgeting in his seat, twiddling his pencil\nand thanking the audience for their\nsupport.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Ramsay\u2019s\ninfamous temper began to boil and\nthe contestants cottoned on to this\nfaster than you can fry an omlette.\nPaul Merton was the main culprit,\ninterrupting Ramsay regularly\nwhilst he read from the autocue.\nBy this point, we were all imagining perusing the \u00e0 la carte Claridge\u2019s and picking the most pretentious dish possible. Whether\nRamsay was genuinely concerned\nwith our pipe dreams or not was\nunclear, since he continued to reassure us we would be tucking into\nhis fine gnosh whilst at the same\ntime there was an impression he\nwas attempting to win our support\nagainst his four adversaries.\nMerton pushed Ramsay to breaking point and he retaliated naming him a \u201cc**t\u201d before adding a\nfurther insult suggesting if Merton\nwas so hot, why wasn\u2019t he sitting in\nthe host\u2019s seat? Game on. Ramsay\nwas like a lamb to the slaughter.\nMerton and his teammate Andrew\nNeil launched into a tirade of jest-ing, ribbing Ramsay about Jamie\nOliver, Anthony Worrall Thompson\nand whatever else caused a re-action. As expected, Merton was\ntoo sharp and Ramsay was looking jaded. Merton made the valid\npoint that he\u2019d being \u201cdoing this\nfor years\u201d and that if he came into\nRamsay\u2019s kitchen, he wouldn\u2019t be\ncheeky about making a shepherd\u2019s\npie.\nMy respect for Ramsay was tainted ever so slightly after walking out\nof the studio. Part of his ability to\nacheive such a high status came\nfrom his ball breaking nature, but\nperhaps even his aren\u2019t made of\nsteel.\nI feel that the televised footage of\nHave I only partially conveyed the\ntense atmosphere and that a lot of\nthe time the editing rendered certain jokes and comments to appear\nout of context. But I respect this\nwould have been a mammoth task.\nNow, to phone Claridge\u2019s.\nIf you can\u2019t take the heat, get out of the kitchen. Gordon Ramsey\ntakes the flak presenting Have I Got News For You.\n27\nfelix\nFriday 20 October 2006\nTV tv.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

    "content": "F\nor some, New York is\nthe fashion capital of the\nworld. During my summer as a New Yorker, I\nmanaged to gatecrash the\nlong haul departure lounge of the\ninternational fashion jet set for the\nSpring 2007 collections.\nMy experience at one of the biggest fashion emporiums on the\nplanet began with my first show,\nAshish N Soni at The Atelier in the\ntents at Bryant Park. First of all, arriving at the main tents was very\nglamorous and I was delighted to\nwade through the intrigued public\noutside with my invitation. Inside\nchandeliers hung from the ceiling\nand the Olympus Fashion Week\nsponsors showcase their offerings.\nAshish N Soni, an Indian designer,\nembraced nature as a main theme\nfor its Spring/Summer 2007 col-lection, with the sounds of ocean\nserenading the models down the\ncatwalk. It was very tranquil and\nthe models cast were very demure,\nwith the collection based mainly on\nsimple whites and blacks. Overall,\nthe production was very calming,\nwhich was particularly unusual for\na late Friday night show.\nAfter a fantastic first night, my\nnext show was Ruffian, which took\nplace at the historic Tilden Mansion at Gramercy Park, home to the\nNational Arts Club. After arriving\nespecially early, I got to see some of\nthe fantastic pre-production: with\nhair by Rolando Beauchamp for\nNew York Fashion Week opens\nJames Burnett\u2019s account of New York\u2019s most fabulous special event out for those with fashion on the brain\n25\nfelix\nFriday 20 October 2006\nFASHION fashion.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBumble & Bumble and make-up by\nRie Omoto and the MAC Pro Team.\nAs you can see from the photos I\ntook, the models were flawless and\nthe collection was exactly as one\nfashionista described: \u2018fresh, modern and wearable\u2019. The American\nmodern collection dazzled, with vibrant and sumptuous colours like\nbutter cup yellow and baby-boy\nblue, but overall the collection focused on creams and beiges with\nlots of silk as well as the traditional\nRuffian ruffles. What I particularly\nloved was the juxtaposition of the\nbeautifully old and the beautifully\nmodern with the 1840s setting and\nthe wonderful creations of Brian\nWolk and Claude Morais. If you love\nyour art, I definitely recommend a\nvisit to this national landmark.\nMy fabulous fashion week was\nabout to get even more fabulous\nwith tickets to Tracy Reese. I was\nvery excited to be going to a much\nbigger show at The Promenade at\nBryant Park. Just by checking out\ntracyreese.com, you can tell that\nshe\u2019s had hugely successful col-lections. The Promenade is a huge\nspace and the world\u2019s press waited\nat the end of the long runway. You\ncould tell the room was bustling\nwith excitement and suspense, and\nthe arrival of Carmen Electra definitely helped add to the energy.\nThe collection was based around\nLatin dance, and the show opened\nwith Luis Bianchi and Daniela Pucci whirling down the runway showing their Spanish flare. The collection of 46 looks was then divided\ninto three sections each named\nafter a dance: Tango, Samba, and\nBarrio, with each being introduced\nby its own dance display and pieces\ntaken from a neutral colour palette,\nwith many voluptuous rather than\nfitted designs.\nThe audience seemed delighted\nby the collection with many showing their approval with a standing\novation and backstage you could\ntell the crowd was overjoyed by Tracy\u2019s new designs.\nAnd what\u2019s even more exciting is\nthat meeting so many amazing peo-ple, such as Marc Dlugoof, Pedro\nL\u00e1zoro, and St\u00e9phane Ho\u00fcy-Towner who took me to the opening of\nthe N store, a very hip boutique in\nHarlem, which was show casing the\nnew collection of Omar Jermaine.\nThe newly renovated structure\nwas a very chic, and the party was\npacked full of models and buyers\ndrinking champagne and raving\nabout the new collection, which is\nreally outstanding; it consists of\ntraditional clothes fashioned in a\nvery modern way. After meeting\nthe designer (who was immaculately dressed) you can just tell that\nhe\u2019s going to be hugely success-ful. Then, after an exploration into\nKorean cuisine, we headed to the\nVenexiana Show at The Metropolitan Pavilion on West 19th Street for\nmore stunning models and sensual\nclothes by Kati Stern, who is based\nin Venice and New York.\nThe Vollbracht Magic\nAll of the shows I have been to have\nbeen special in their specific type\nof fashion, but I just can\u2019t get over\nthe Bill Blass show. Lucky enough\nto obtain an invitation with the art\nnouveau, inter-clasped double B\nemblem gracing the cover, I was\nthrilled. After being moved to fill a\nsecond row seat in the Tent behind\nSigourney Weaver, Joan Rivers,\nand Liza Minnelli, with Janet Jackson opposite; it dawned on me that\nBill Blass is a big deal. Admittedly,\nI had never heard of this label be-fore, apart from seeing a Bill Blass\nhoarding off Times Square. When\nI think of the best American dress\ndesigner, I usually think Ralph Lauren, but after the timeless yet modern elegance of Bill Blass I think I\nmay have changed my mind.\nThe day ready-to-wear collection\nwas defined by its simplicity, typified by a high cut pale blue sheath\ndress and sandals modelled by Morgane Dubled. The only consistency\nin this varied section was that each\noutfit featured its own distinctive\nbelt. What I especially loved were\nthe dresses presented towards the\nend of the show. They were the epitome of high glamour with each being totally individual. One that particularly caught my attention was a\nlavender neck to toe jersey gown,\nwhich covered almost every inch\nof Julianna Imai\u2019s skin. It was like\nshe floated down the runway. And\nCamila Finn modelling an exquisite\nembroidered gown comprising of\ninterwoven deep and bright reds\nwith multiple trails of confetti.\nThe models, including Freja\nBeha, Hana Soukupova and Izabel\nGoulart were an especially beautiful selection and perfect in the\ncontext of the show\u2019s overall pro-duction, which reminded me of an\nAgatha Christie \u2018Poirot\u2019 novel, and\nof the movie \u2018Gosford Park\u2019: very fif-ties, with an infusion of modernity.\nAnd of course when the time came,\nan extremely impressed crowd\nrose straight from their seats to\ncongratulate Michael Vollbracht on\nhis magic.\nChado Ralph Rucci\nDisplaying both his Spring 2007 and\nWinter 2006 Haute Couture collections as the last big show of New\nYork Fashion Week, Ralph Rucci\nfurthered his engraving in the fashion history books with elaborate designs and ornate detailing. As the\nonly American to be invited to display his creations in Paris since the\nforties, Rucci is arguably the most\ninfluential American designer on\nthe global fashion stage.\nOne continuous element that\ncharacterises Rucci\u2019s work is\nthe extravagance of the looks he\nproduces. It is this opulence that\ngained the attention of France\u2019s\npremier fashion council, the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture,\nwhich invited Rucci to display his\nhaute couture collection in Paris.\nWith his success in Europe, Rucci\nhas once again stunned the New\nYork Fashion Week crowd with the\nintricate detailing and sheer lavishness of his outfits. What\u2019s even\nmore astounding is that Rucci is\nnow celebrating 25 Years in fashion\ndesign and numerous exhibits and\nawards are honouring a quarter of\na century of Rucci\u2019s creations.\nThe Chado 2007 Ready to Wear\nCollection emphasised a current\ntrend by many designers to use\npython skin in their pieces. However, Rucci incorporates taupe and\nbrown shades with the skin and all\nblack and all white designs, which\nwere supplemented by two cinnabar looks in a double-faced wool\ncrepe design. One dress in particular epitomises Rucci\u2019s attention to\ndetail; the organza dress made with\nivory linen and pearl embroidery.\nHowever, the embroidered script\ncaftan modelled by Ingrid Schram\nand the doubled faced cashmere\ncostume with Japanese scholar\nprint of the Winter Haute Couture\ncollection further delighted an already exuberant audience.\nHowever, Rucci had not yet\nreached his pinnacle, as look after\nlook shone with luxurious fabrics\nand impeccable craftsmanship\ndrawing continuous applause from\nthe audience. Velvets, chiffons and\nsatins with an incorporation of the\nblacks and chocolates of the Ready\nto Wear Collection, It was certainly\nobvious that the organisers of Fashion Week had left the most lavish\nshow to last.\nFelix\u2019s fashion correspondent watches women strut their stuff at the New York Fashion Week\nOne model has a hidden message for her English speaking haters\n\n"

    "content": "Turning the tables on Mendeleev\nAs we approach the 100th anniversary of his death we take a look back at the man responsible for that chart\nDmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was\nborn in Tobolsk, Siberia in February 1834. His father died when\nMendeleev was around 13 years\nold, leaving his mother Maria to\nraise the family on her own. Money\nwas tight, following the loss to fire\nof his mother\u2019s family business,\nand his only chance of going to university was to win a scholarship.\nIn 1849, the family relocated to St\nPetersburg, where Mendeleev was\naccepted into the Main Pedagogical\nInstitute.\nMendeleev married his first wife\nFeozva Nikitichna around 1862, under the influence of his sister Olga.\nHowever, 8 years and two children\nlater, the couple was living sepa-rately. In 1877, Mendeleev met and\nbecame infatuated with Anna Popova, a teenaged art student staying\nin Petersburg with his older sister\nEkaterina. When Mendeleev first\nproposed in 1879, Anna turned him\ndown and was sent away to Rome\nby her father. Not to be deterred,\nMendeleev went to Rome in 1881\nand proposed again, vowing to kill\nhimself if she refused him. She ac-cepted, and Mendeleev and his first\nwife were divorced in February\n1882. According to Orthodox law,\nMendeleev should have waited seven years before marrying Anna, but\nthe couple was married in January\n1882, earning Mendeleev public notoriety as a bigamist.\nWhile most people recognize\nMendeleev as the primary creator\nof the periodic table of the elements,\nNaomi Antony few are aware of his other pursuits.\nMendeleev was passionate about\nmetrology. In the early 1860s, he\nplayed a central role in the Ministry\nof Finance\u2019s strategy to reform the\nstate\u2019s alcohol industry by converting Russian volumes and weight\nmeasures to metric ones. Convinced that the introduction of the\nmetric system would be symbolic of\na westernizing Russia, he advocated its introduction throughout the\n1860s. Mendeleev was eventually\nappointed Director of the Bureau of\nWeights and Measures in 1893.\nIn the 1870s, Spiritualism began\nto spread across Russia in a wave\nof frenzy. The focus was on s\u00e9ances,\nusually led by a medium. Many of\nMendeleev\u2019s colleagues, including\nAleksandr Butlerov, were drawn to\nspiritualism. Mendeleev helped establish the \u2018Commission for the InvestigationofMediumisticPhenomena\u2019 in order to prove that mediums\nwere frauds. From 1875-1876, he attended several s\u00e9ances, writing up\nreports after each one. In a series\nof lectures, he publicly attacked\nspiritualism, declaring seances as\n\u201csimple-minded manipulation of\nthe rheotric of facts.\u201d The spiritualist community was outraged as he\nhad violated their codes of practice\nby faking noises during one of the\nElementary, my\ndear Dimitri\nThe periodic table is an iconic symbol of science, but it\u2019s easy to forget\nwhat is so great about it. Anyone\nwho has studied chemistry will be\nfamiliar with the table that shows\noff the elements in all their organised glory. But when Mendeleev\nfirst proposed it back in 1869, only\nsixty of the elements were known\nand the idea that the similarity of\nelements could tell us anything fundamental about their nature was\nunexplored.\nThe table as we know it today\nshows 115 elements in \u2018groups\u2019, displayed in columns, and \u2018periods\u2019 in\nrows, but in the early nineteenth\ncentury even the elements themselves were not well defined. Any\nsimilarities in the way they combined or looked were curious but\nnot regarded as very important.\nAtomic weight could be determined\n(similar to our measure of relative\natomic mass) but what this meant\nfor the element was unclear.\nBy 1817 patterns began to\nemerge. Johann Dobereiner noted\nthat when three similar elements\nwere lined up in atomic weight or-der, the properties of the middle\none would often be the average of\nthe other two. After the publication\nof more accurate atomic weights in\n1860, a flurry of new ideas surfaced\nthat speculated of a higher rela-tionship. In 1862 the French geologist A.E. Beguyer de Chancourtois\nnoted that not only did these similarities exist but that when ordered\nby atomic weight they occurred\nroughly every eighth element. The\ntable\u2019s shape was evolving.\nChancourtois could have claimed\nthe creation of the first periodic\ntable, but the dense and incomprehensible nature of his publication\nmeant it met with little success. Errors in identifying and placing elements seriously limited the table\u2019s\npractical use.\nMendeleev himself is supposed\nto have happened upon the idea of\nputting the elements into a table\nwhilst playing a game of patience.\nHaving written the properties of\nthe elements on the cards, while rearranging them he noticed the regular pattern of eight with certain\ntypes of elements always followed\nby another type.\nThe publication of Mendeleev\u2019s\n\u2018Periodic System\u2019 in 1869 overshadowed other contemporary papers.\nIn part this was because of the well-timed release but also due to its\nsheer ambition. Mendeleev was so\nimpressed by the simplicity of the\nrepeating pattern that where the\natomic weights disrupted it, he ignored them. Elements were put the\nwhere its properties said it should\ngo. Where he found inconsistencies he double-checked results -performing his own atomic weight\nexperiments. If still he found no element to fit a space, he left a gap,\nprefering to believe there were\nelements undiscovered, rather\nthan concede to anomalies in the\npattern.\nThese gaps helped prior Mendeleev make predictions about the\nmissing elements. From looking\nat an empty position in the table\nhe could predict the properties of\nthe mystery element with great\naccuracy. Two of these were found\nwithin 15 years of publication and\nthe precise nature of his predictions served to cement the value of\nhis periodic system.\nIn the end Mendeleev correctly\nrepositioned fourteen different elements in defiance of their accepted\natomic weight and predicted ten\nentirely new ones, seven of which\nwere later found.\nOver the years scientists have\namended the table with new discoveries and observations. Lord\nRayleigh added a \u2018group zero\u2019 of\nnewly discovered noble gases in\n1895 and Henry Mosley lead a reordering according to atomic charge\nrather than weight, after discoveries of isotopes showed that these\ndid not always correspond.\nThe following century saw a\nsearch for the reasons behind the\nelements\u2019 fundamental similarities\ndisplayed in Mendeleev\u2019s table. An\natomic explanation for the behaviour of elements relating physical\nand chemical properties to atomic\nweight and charge is now deeply\nrooted in our understanding of\nchemistry and matter itself.\nThe iconic image of the complete Periodic Table.\ns\u00e9ances (which he admitted).\nMendeleev had little patience for\nDostoevsky and Tolstoy, finding\nthem torturously descriptive. He\npreferred works of adventure, particularly those by Jules Verne, and\nattempted Vernesque adventure\nin his own life twice. He developed\na fascination with ballooning, a\npursuit that he believed would aid\nhim with his meteorological stud-ies, and took flight in 1887 to study\nthe solar eclipse of 7 August 1887;\nan event documented in his article\nAn Air Flight From Klin during the\nEclipse. Then, inspired by Verne\u2019s\nA Journey To The North Pole, Mendeleev attempted an Arctic adventure of his own. Together with S.O.\nMakarov, a naval hero, he built an\nicebreaker on which he proposed\na journey to chart a viable northern sea route (Gordin 2004). Alas,\nhis efforts to get his plan endorsed\nfailed and he fell out with Makarov,\nto whom he never spoke again.\nIt is evident that Mendeleev was\nfar more than just a chemist. As\nwell as a metrologist, meteorologist and advocate against Spiritualism, Mendeleev was also an active\ncitizen, committed to improving the\ntechnological advances of Russia\nand deeply concerned about the\nsocial problems of his time. His\nwell-publicised rejection from the\nAcademy Of Sciences in 1880 only\nincreased his popularity, elevating\nhim to an almost celebrity status\nand, to this day, he remains Russia\u2019s most recognised scientific\nname. Mendeleev passed away in\nJanuary 1907, aged 73.\nMendeleev\u2019s statue outside his old residence in St Petersburg\nLizzie Gibney\nRussia\u2019s most\nrecognised\nscientific name\n7\nfelix\nFriday 20 October 2006\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"
