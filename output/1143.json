    "content": "10 Science 4 May 1999\nJust what is a Widget?\nMarvel of the modern age or a triumph of PR over practicality? Anita Chakraverty investigates.\nYou' ve probably heard Jack Dee waxing lyrical about them, but do you know what one actually is? Iam talking, of course, about the wi d get. If you have ever been sufficiently\nbored to shake a can of beer around once you have finished with it, you may have heard something rattling\naround inside the can. This is the wi d get. In an attempt to find a meaning, I consulted Collins English dictionary.\nApparently the official definition of a widget is ' a small mechanism or device,\nthe name of which is unknown or temporarily forgotten.' This is not very help ful. A widget is in fact a small plastic\ndevice in a can of beer that promises to serve that 'just served by the landlord'\ntaste of draught beer in the comfort of your own home. They come in many different shapes and sizes, depending on what kind of beer you drink, but all are\ndesigned to release nitrogen in the can,\nwhich creates an effect mimicking hand-pumped beer.\nAir is predominantly made up of nitrogen so, in theory, the action of the widget creates a similar effect to air mixing with beer as it is pulled through a spout from a cask. All beer naturally contains carbon dioxide as a by-product of fermentation( although extra maybe added), and it is this which gives the beer\nIts gas in ess. The bubbles are big and coarse, and produce the 'hiss' when opening a can of beer or lager. The add i tion of nitrogen from the widget creates\nmuch finer bubbles which produce creamy, long-lasting foam the much sought-after creamy head, found in beers\nsuch as Bod ding ton's Gold or Guinness. The problem with putting nitrogen in\nthe can is that it is much more soluble\nand temperature sensitive than carbon\ndioxide, so some of it\nhas to be isolated from\nthe rest of the beer until the can is\nopened, when it can then rush out. Initially,\nnitrogen is introduced\ninto the beer as a liq-u id, and only become sagas once the lid is\nattached to the can. As\nit becomes a gas some is forced under the widget creating a pocket of gas, isolated\nfrom the rest of the beer until the can is\nopened. The change in pressure as the can opens forces this nitrogen back out\ninto the beer.\nWidget s are a relatively new in ven tion - they were first introduced to us\nAs Jack Dee said: \"WldgeL.lt's got awl d get... w ld get... a widget It has got\"\nby Guinness, in 1989. The company had been using nitrogen in keg-stout\nsince the60' s which, in combination with a special spout, ensured that the stout always poured with the requisite white, creamy head. The same principle was then used to market their cans of stout.\nOther companies started introducing their own widget s creamy, long-lasting\nduring the recession of the early 90's. As foam...\"\nthe public started\n\"...nitrogen from\nthe widget creates\nmuch finer bubbles\nwhich produce\n\"...a small\nmechanism or\ndevice, the name of\nwhich is unknown\nor temporarily\nforgotten...\"\nfeeling the pinch, they began to go out\nless, spending more money on home entertainment such as\nvideogames and CD's. There is a general trend for people to drink more during a recession eventhough they have less\nmoney to spend, and breweries were puzzled that beer sales\nwere n't increasing. They conducted market research which showed that people didn't like drinking\nbeer at home simply because it wasn't like the beer you got at the pub. Enter\nthe widget or, in PR speak the Draught flow System. There are now dozens of types of widget. Bod ding ton's Flowers and Whitbread-Draughtf low use around plastic cartridge, Stones Bitter has a paper fan-like object\nin it, and Tetley's has a plastic worm held in place by a collar.\nGuinness have now gone one step further and released Widget2, the floating widget. This one, known as the \"Snake\"\n( because it rattles\nwhen the can is\nempty), consists of a tiny ping pong ball\nfilled with gas that\nswirls around the beer\nas its being poured, producing a much thicker head. Guin ness have developed two versions of the Snake: for bitter, a small pin-prick size hole allows the ball to spin slowly through the drink creating a creamy head; for lager, the ball has two pin-prick holes which means it spins faster\nto make it busier and bubblier.\nThe reason for the sudden interest in\nwidget s is simple: The market for wi d get beers is growing at 2 0 % per year\nand in five years time is likely to represent 5 0 % of the take-home beer mar-ket.\nThe big question is whether widget beer Is any good. Many critics note. in five years time,\nwidget beer is\nk ely to represent\n50% of the\ntake-home beer\nmarket...\"\nthat the widget only works once the can is first opened, and that it does not\nprovide a complete solution to the difficulties posed by using nitrogen. Certain cans of widget beer, John Smith's for example, still act very differently\nwhen opened at different temperatures. These beers have to be chilled\nbefore opening, otherwise the beer\nspurts out, dousing the carpet and drenching any unsuspecting crisps in\nthe vicinity.\nOther critics claim that widget s make beer taste bland and foamy. Beer\nwriter of the year, Andrew Jefford, says\n\"all that creamy foam can get a bit cloying after a while, and there' s nothing natural about nitrogen in beer...for\ncomplexity and sublimity of flavour,\nyou need true, living\ndraught: ale drawn from a nun gassed, gently respiring cask.\"\nEven the purists do, however, acknowledge that canned, widget beer is prefer-able to canned, non widget beer. Jonathan\nTuttle, a representative of CAM RA, the campaign for real ale,\nsays \"It ruins the complexity of beer...but if all you want is a creamy beer with a big head, it's brilliant\".\nNonetheless, the popularity of these beers suggests that, regardless of\nthe critics, widget beer is here to stay.\nAnyone for a pint?\n\n"

    "content": "2 News 4 May 1999\nAccommodation's Adverse Advice\nBy David Roberts\nAn alleged incident in the College's Accommodation Centre has thrown the new, much publicised,' student friendly' drive into assistance with private sector accommodation into stark\nrelief.\nA group of students looking for\nsomewhere to live next year noticed their current house( which cannot be\nidentified for legal reasons) listed in\nthe Centre's lists - at \u00a390 per week, compared to the \u00a365 per week they arc paying at present. Understandably intrigued to discover the reasons behind this 4 0 % increase, they asked the member of staff on duty if they knew anything about it - and were shocked when they were informed that the College\" recommended that\nthe landlord increased her rent to \u00a390,\nas the present charge was far too low and doesn't represent the market value\". Ignoring questions over whether \u00a390 a week for a room in West Brompt on does actually represent market value, every senior figure questioned has viewed this incident as a shocking indictment of the Accommodation Office's attitude toward student hou sing - particularly as the running of the office is paid for out of Hall fees( ie by\nthe students) and not by any form of commission from landlords. Alternatively, from a simple financial outlook, assuming each student accepts a stan-mmm s mmm dard nine month let, this advice stands\nto cost each resident in the house concerned a massive \u00a3950 in the next\nacademic year.\nMoreover, as the College does not\nprovide any vetting service (instead\nsimply providing regularly updated lists, advice and information) the stud ents concerned were surprised that\nthe accommodation staff feel they can\noffer any advice on prices, commenting that \" suggesting prices without viewing the property would seem to\nbe a complete lottery\".\nWhether this 'advice' represents standard policy, or is the result of the actions of one rogue member of accommodation staff, is at present unknown.

Of 0171 5S4 Imperial Second Best\nImperial College is now the second best university in the country, according to the ever reliable Times league tables.\nThe league table, published on Ihursday 23 April, revealed that Oxford has\nfallen into third place, with Cambridge keeping the top spot.\nImperial won through thanks to\ngood scores in the teaching assessment category, the most important rat-ing in the table, and reduced Cambridge' s lead from last year. Meanwhile Oxford is now only one point ahead of fourth place London School of\nEconomics. Sir Ronald Ox burgh, Rector\nof Imperial College, was quoted as saying he was \"pleasantly surprised\" at the\nresult, putting Oxford's decline down to\nBy Ed Sexton\nan inability to reform( something, apparently, Imperial has excelled in).\nImperial also topped the table in\nthe staffing levels and facility funding categories, reflecting the huge amount of money spent by the college in recent\nyears. University College London was fifth, with the School of Oriental and African studies coming sixth, meaning that London colleges took two thirds of\nthe top six places.\nThe rest of the Times table was fairly predictable, with Edinburgh still\ntop of the Scottish universities and Oxford Brookes still ahead in the former\npolytechnics, coming ahead of several\nof the 'traditional' institutions.\nWith such a diverse range of universities and academic disciplines rep-resented in the tables, it is difficult to\njudge their true value. One category\nthat is missing, and which many students would consider relevant to university ratings, is student satisfaction\nwith their institution. Indeed, many would argue that this is the most important criteria to judge a university by.\nIt is unlikely that Imperial will be\nable to take the top spot from Cam bridge in the foreseeable future, but all\neyes will be on LSE and Oxford next\nyear to see which of them will take third place.\nissue 1143\n4 May 1999\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nAssistant Editor & Films: David Roberts\nArts & Books Editor: Helena Co che me Games Editor: Gary Smith\nClubscene: Giles Morrison,\nGur minder Mar wah a& Joel Lewis\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nPhotographic Editor: Jonas Lindsay\nIs your\npint really\nnecessary?\\\nKOSOVO APPEAL08706060900 Collection box in the Felix Office!\nj|p:;::; j;:i~;' \u2022 :\n;\nFelix, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road, London SW7 2BB Internal tel: 58072 Internal fax: 48072 External tel & fax: 0171 594 8072 URL: www.su.ic.ac.uk/Felix E mail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPrinted at M CP Litho Limited, Units B2 & B3, Hatton Square, 16 -16a Baldwins Gardens, London EC1N 7RJ Felix is a registered newspaper: ISSN 1040 - 0711\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publication Board.

    "content": "4 May 1999 Books 15\nTHE OXFORD BOOK OF WORK\nEdited by Keith Thomas\nI 'll resist the obvious attempt to inject a bit of\" humour\" through the device of pointing out how reading this book is a lot of work; it\nis a hefty 600-page anthology of writ-in gon, as the title says, work. Sir\nKeith Thomas, once high flying his-tori an, former President of the British\nAcademy and current President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, has ferreted out writings on work of all\nkinds, from\" Students, Scholars and Scientists\" to the\" Shadier Trades\", and has, I must say, succeeded in\nshattering any first impression one might have that the task of compiling such an anthology is necessarily a dreary, onerous one. This work is\nclearly a labour of love, and Thomas' well chosen material shines light on many different aspects of work. The editor introduces the book by pointing out how modern employment is actually a modern development without and out slavery, serfdom and other forms of compulsory labour accounting for a large proportion of work done in the past, and briefly examines the tricky question as\nto whether a housewife or a child doing homework is actually \" working\" in the same sense as a manual labourer. The answer, of course, depends on how the term\" work\" is\ndefined. The editor has, rightly in my opinion, chosen to take a broader view of work than any narrow one, quoting the standard example of non intellectuals failing to see the point of\" head work\", deeming it useless and unworthy in any real, practical sense. The opinions and ideas presented in the quotes, essays, poems and extracts from novels presented here range across a wide spectrum, from traditional upperclass arrogance as in Arthur Young' s\" Everyone but an idiot knows that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never be industrious\" and the intellectually snobbish William Alley's\"... it is illiberal and servile to get the living with the hand and sweat of the body\", to the ideology of Marx and Engels. Sir James Denham' s mid nineteenth century observation that\nmen had become\" slaves to their own work\" finds a place, as does DH Lawrence' s lament\" earning a wage is a prison occupation\". The authors Thomas has chosen range from the likes of Gautama Buddha, Herodotus and Virgil to the modern day Tom Wolfe and Vikram Seth. Most extracts have been classified under specific sections and are chosen to illustrate a specific point; Parkinson' s own description of the famous law that bears his name\" Work expands to fill the time available\" crops up In the section on\" reluctant\" workers, while W.E. Oates' own definition of his addition to the English language the word\" work a holi sm\" finds a place under based on profession that is yet another example of a system that\nstarted out with the best of intentions and with complete fluidity, but has since been twisted by dishonour able individuals with vested inter-est s. Charles Dickens and Thomas Hardy feature conspicuously, cropping up all over the book, and, for\" Addiction to Work\", for instance. Idleness merits its own little section here,with the expected Rip Van Win kle extract and quotes from John Stuart Milland Bertrand Russell (\"I think that there is far too much work done in the world,... the need no longer exists\"). Expressions of discontent and disgruntle ment appear throughout, notably in Joe Corrie' s worker's rail against his \" machine\",\" leering and mocking\" at its \" helpless slave\". There' s also a piece by K.Ish war an on India's notorious( and now outlawed) caste system, a blatantly unfair and unjust division of society into arbitrary hierarchical classes the masochist, there' s some truly\n\" heavy\" verse from Gerard Manley Hopkins, a Jesuit poet from the last\ncentury. Of course, the conspicuous literary adornment doesn't mean that\nall is heavy and serious the section on\" Looking for a Job\" is particularly\nlighthearted, featuring a brilliantly funny piece from Ogden Nash. The anthology closes, appropriately enough, with a look at life after work, a section particularly relevant to the many leading a life of enforced retire-ment, unable to find gainful employment after falling victim to the\" downsizing\" and\" cost cutting\" ploys\nof organisations large and small. To me, the very best pieces in\nthis tome are those referring to pride and satisfaction in the doing of one's work A. E. Housman' s description of how he wrote a poem of his is a case in point. A particularly moving and evocative paragraph from Edward Gibbon's memoirs depicts his pang of humility and melancholy after the initial euphoria and triumph at his completion of\" The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\". The feeling of contentment one gets upon shutting the volume, even after the briefest of dips, alone makes this a book worth obtaining it's almost surprising how many time sI'd find myself reading this book, having just picked it up to dip in at random or to look something up. The anthology is not without its\nblemishes the sections on the role of women and child labour in the world of work seem a bit underdeveloped, as does the section on soldiers; there are doubtless many fine writings on the subject. The large amount of literature that can be found both in print and in electronic form on engineering work and part icu lar lyon computer programmers and their unique approach to the world of work does not appear to have been considered at all, either, sadly while this does not detract from the overall merit of the book, it does render the inescapable feeling that, large and detailed though this collection is, something is lack-ing. Some of the extracts from nov els are necessarily long, clearly to establish context, but a fair number of these are perhaps far too long and rambling to fit comfortably well into what amounts to a general collection of short pieces. The\" Indexof Authors and Sources Quoted\" at the end isn't particularly well constructed, either, and leaves out a number of references, which essentially meant I couldn't cheat by just\nlooking at the index! Yet, these failings are minor, forgivable even, especially considering the background of the author and the true literary merit of most of the included pieces. This is certainly a book that attracts puzzled and incredulous attention from nearly everybody who sees it, and is aw or thy addition to anybody' s bookshelf.

ICSM Summer Ball\nDear Felix,\nThe lead article on26/4/99 in Felix\nclaimed that there is a sour relationship\nbetween the IC and ICSM Summer Ball\nOrganisers and that they are in fierce\ncompetition. From my point of view, that\nis not the case at all and there is no need for any animosity at .all. The ICSM Su mmer Ball is on the24 th of June to co-or di nate with Exam results and not to spark\nany competition for ticket sales. Our ball\nis for ICSM, it is aimed at Medical Students, we are advertising only in the hospital and the BMS, holding it at a Medics venue and following the traditions of along long history of St Mary's and Charing Cross Summer Balls. I believe I speak for the majority of Med ical Students in saying that if they are\ngoing to a summer ball it will be the ICSM\nevent. Those first years, the only students based at IC, who regard them selves as part of theMed School will\njoin the rest of us on24 th of June, those\nwho don't, won'tan dIdo believe they\nare the only group with a decision to\nmake.

    "content": "4 May 1999 Spori 19\nCan Man Utd do the treble?\nAs the football season winds up for this year, the question on everyone's minds is can Manchester United to the unprecedented treble - that is win the FA Cup, Ihe Premiership, and, perhaps biggest of all, the European cup. Here is a quick look at what they will have to do if they want lo succeed. LEAGUE FA CUP EUROPEAN CUP\nWhile Arsenal were busy thrashing Middlesbrough61 at the Riverside, Man Utd could\nonly draw with Leeds. This left Arsenal top of the league with Man Utd a point behind\nin second. Chelsea could only draw with Sheffield Wednesday and Leicester, and after losing in the Cup-Winner's cup semi final, it looks like being a fruitless season for the\nWest Londoners.\nLooking at the remaining matches, it is clear that Arsenal have the tougher task,\nwith home matches against Derby and Aston Villa, as well as a trip to Leeds and a tough North London derby with Tottenham, and ex-manager George Graham. United hardly have a much easier task, facing Villa at home before taking on Liverpool, Blackburn and Middlesbrough away, and finishing up with Spurs at Old Trafford.\nManchester United look to be favourites, however, although Alex Ferguson may be tempted to rest players for fear of risking injury with the end of season European Cup Final. That will be Arsenal's chance to get in and pick up ground on Utd.\nIt is interesting that both Tottenham and Aston Villa are both involved and could\nhelp dictate the destination of the title. Arsenal fans will be particularly incensed\nif their team loses to a I otten ham side managed by the Arsenal revered George Graham.\nFelix prediction: Arsenal not quite strong enough. Man Utd - Just\nf MANCHESTER UNITED \" \\ f~ ARSENAL\nSat May1( h)As ton Villa\nWed May5( a) Liverpool\nSun May9( a) Middlesbrough Wed May12( a) Blackburn\nSun May16( h) Tottenham Sun May2( h) Derby County\nWed May5( a) Tottenham Tue May11( a) Leeds Utd Sun May16( h) Aston Villa\nMan Utd v Newcastle Utd\nThe first time ever that two Uniteds have\nmet in the final of the oldest cup com petition in the world, and it should be a good encounter. With one eye on the European cup final the following Wednesday, Alex Ferguson is likely to rest Nicky Butt and possibly Dwight Yorke/Andy Cole and Peter Schmeichel. It has long been known that the European cup is the trophy he truly desires.\nNewcastle manager Ruud Guillit will\nbe hoping that Duncan Ferguson will\nhave returned to partner Alan Shearer in\nattack, but his side will have to improve\nsignificantly on their performance in the\nsemi-final defeat of Tottenham. Their\ndefence, in particular, is looking a bit sus-pec t. However, the match will likely be fairly open with Ferguson resting some players and therefore making the teams\nmore even.\nFelix prediction: Draw11 Newcastle to win in extra time Bayern Munich v Man Utd.\nto be played at Nou camp Stadium,\nBarcelona\nThe key to this match for Ul d is Ryan\nGiggs. Following his brilliant goal against\nArsenal a couple of weeks ago, Ferguson will look to him to provide the play\nmaking especially with attacking midfielders Roy Keane and Paul Scholes sus-pended. United should really be up for\nthis match as the atmosphere in the Nou camp stadium is unlike any other.\nBayern have a bit of a reputation for\nbeing a bit like George Graham's Arsenal - they play for the result and are thus\nusually fairly dull. None of their players\nparticularly stand out, apart from the experienced Lothar Matthau s at\nsweeper. This has the potential to be a great\nmatch, with both teams in their first\nEuropean final for over 20 years.\nLooking into my crystal ball I can see Alex\nFerguson's dream at last being realized.\nFelix prediction: Man Utd win 2-0\nAEROBICS Summer '99\nDay Time Level Description\nMonday 12.-30\n5:30\n6.-30\nGeneral\nGeneral\nIntermediate\nCircuit Training\nBody Sculpt\nAerobics\nTuesday 5:30 IntlAdv Aerobics\nWednesday\n1.-00\n5.-30\nGeneral\nIntermediate\nBody Sculpt\nSTEP\nThursday 12:30\n5:30\nBegUnt\nIntermediate\nBody Conditioning\nAerobics\nFriday 5:30 IntfAdv Aerobics\nSunday 2,-00 Advanced STEP\nKbnaingftHt Gordons\nKen*!-Site\ny RCA rr~ fy!+ \u2022\n\u2022\n: i. ai:\n<\n:\n\u2022\n: =\u00a3\u2022.\nrI I\"f' n nov r:t CLASSES HELD HERE Q as s Prices\nMembers \u00a3 1 . 2 5\nNon Mein b er sJ?,2.00 Professional Instructors\nat Student Prices!!\nSpecialOffer!\n1/4 Price\nMembership\nI,2 IC Students\n& 3 IC Staff/Other Students\nOnly 'Validfor 3 Weefe\n(Offer end Mon17th 'May 99)\n\" AH( 'tosses are hel ri(.To Joto fa,. fast tarn up\n\n"

    "content": "12 Film 4 May 1999\n8mm*** Starring : Nicholas Cage, Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini\nDirector: Joel Schumacher\nOnce again we find ourselves\nin \"looked like a great idea on\npaper\" territory, with\nColumbia Pictures this time footing\nthe bill to bring together a highly profitable director (Schmacher), an\nimmensely popular and talented actor\n(Cage) and an acclaimed scriptwriter\n(Se/en's Andrew Kevin Walker). And yet again the Hollywood money-men\nare proven wrong, thanks to a passable but ultimately disappointing\nmovie which has struggled to recoup\nits $40 million budget.\nSo what's the problem? Put simply,\nit's that the movie isn't sickening\nenough. 5e7en had even the hardest\nhorror nuts on the edge of their seats,\nwaiting to see what Brad Pitt would do\nwhen he found out what was in the\nbox; meanwhile, 8mm will leave you sitting comfortably. You see, 8mm is a movie about snuff films - movies which\nseem to show a real murder taking\nplace - and Schmacher seems to\nbelieve that Nick Cage going\" Oh no...oh...please... oh....no\" all the time\nis going to convince us that he really is\nin a murky, unpleasant world. It does-Iflt shocks Joaquin Phoenix then It's gotta be nasty.\nn't. Indeed, in this graphically-violent\nage, even the snuff movie itself simply\nisn't shocking enough.\nYou see, traditionally, snuff movies\nhave largely been considered something of an urban myth - with the\nmajority of polite society unable to\naccept that anyone would be sick\nenough to pay for (and get thrills out\nof) some grainy footage of a real mur-der. Cage's role is thus to do the pri-v ate eye thing, and find out whether or\nnot they're really out there - and in so\ndoing he begins to lose his own sense\nof morality, slipping further and further into the abyss. Which (as\nSchmacher can't resist drumming into\nwhenever possible) is the real thrust of\nthe movie. He starts out as a moral,\nfamily loving good guy, and is progressively drawn deeper into a world of\nporn, S&M, seedy directors, coming\nout the other end as a murdering, trau-mati sed, emotional wreck. Yawn. Sadly,\nthat's hardly enough to keep you going\nfor the requisite 90 minutes, so whilst\nthere are moments when 8mm seems\non the verge of crackling into life, it\nsimply fizzles along.\nDespite Cage's dark portrayal, without the necessary feeling of horror or\nrevulsion you're left with a distinctly\naverage thriller, which, whilst painfully\nyearning for indie credibility, ultimately\nfinds itself plastered in Hollywood\nclich e and morality. Q Dave\nMessage In A Bottle * *\nStarring : Kevin Costner, Robin Wright Penn, Paul Newman, Robbie Coltrane\nDirector: Luis Mandoki\nC hick-flick is a term I try to avoid\nunder normal circumstances,\nlargely because I really love your\naverage soppy romantic comedy, and\nI'm worried what that says about my\npersonality. However, once in a while\nyou come across the type of movie\nwhich is so completely fuelled by long,\nmeaningful looks into the middle-dis-t ance, deep, deliberate sighs and moonlight dinners that there's simply\nno other term to describe them. We're\ntalking movies that are trying to make\nyou cry - the kind of movies your mum probably likes....and the kind of\nmovies that should op l star Kevin\nCostner.\nAs you've probably guessed, Message In A Bottle is such a movie. Wright\nPenn is a divorced journalist who finds\na bottle with a( yep, you guessed it)\nmessage inside, which is so heartfelt\nand romantic that she instantly falls in\nlove with its writer and begins to track\nhim down. Sadly, the letter's writer isn't In the words of Sting: \"Sending out an SOS to the world\".\nthe fabulous Paul Newman (engagingly\ngrumpy in every scene); rather it's his\nson, Costner, a small-town boat-builder\nwho's still mourning the loss of his wife,\ntwo years earlier. In essence/it's pretty\nstandard, predictable stuff, which\nhinges on a few twists - mostly non-ex is tent, and certainly insufficient to pad out\na two hour movie - and some decent\nperformances from the leads. Oh dear.\nYou see, the real problem with\nKevin Costner, the real reason why most\nof his recent movies have flopped so\nspectacularly, is that he's so incredibly\ndull. This man is not someone you're\ngoing to fall in love with - you're going\nto be falling asleep before the end of\nthe first date. We're talking an honest\nto goodness, solid timber, special-offer-at-Homebase, 2\" by 4\" plank. Consequently, despite the best attempts of '\nNewman and Coltrane (who puts in a surprisingly convincing US accent\nalongside his usual enjoy ably ham my< performance), this is a movie that simply falls to engage on an emotional\nlevel - even when the \"surprise\" ending\nlurks into view.\nAll of which adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying experience, emblazoned with absolutely no sense of\nrealism and some painfully cheesy dialogue - and it's not even feel-good. A chick-flick indeed. Q Dave\n\n"

    "content": "14 Arts 4 May 1999\nWILLIAM KENTRIDGE\nSerpentine Gallery\nWilliam Kentridge is a powerful\nfilm artist. He was born in\nJohannesburg in 1955 and so\ngrew up under apartheid. He was a student of Politics and African culture.\nThe films he creates are potent attacks\non aspects of society, particularly with\nregard to the injustices of the capitalist system and the effect these can\nhave on the individual.\nThe method employed to produce\nhis graphic portrayals is unique. After\ndrawing the first frame - with charcoal\nand sparse use of pastel colours - he\nphotographs it. Next he modifies and\nreforms, blends, erases and redraws,\nand thus transforms the first frame into\nthe second. This step by step approach\nleaves trace markings of the previous\nframes, showing the passage of time\nwithin every moment. Very original,\nvery striking.\nKentridge, rather than being specifically concerned with apartheid,\nreaches to and explores wider issues of\nsuffering. Issues such as the longing of\nthe individual versus responsibility\ntowards society as a whole. He does\nnot use his art as a political instrument\nto didactic ally sway others to his own\nbeliefs, but rather uses these issues as\na spring board for his films. He views\nhis creations as pure and thinks them\nvoid of social morals - \"I don't think\nthere is a social responsibility for an\nartist\".\nIncidentally, the man pictured at\nthe top, and used by Kentridge to symbolise how ill capitalist greed can make\nyou, is called Felix - how ironic.\n\u2022 '. . ::\u2022 .... '\nFor those turned off by politics, I can assure you that the films are enter-tai ning. Judging them aside from any\npolitical criteria they are still well worth\nIt; at times shocking and often funny.\nThe films are not pessimistic or maudlin\nimages of the ills of society but instead\nvigorous attacks on these ills. It is quite\npossible to appreciate the work for just\nthis vigorous energy and nothing else.\nPersonally, I found this the most\nintriguing aspect of his art; it would be\nlying to suggest that the meaning or\nplot of some of the more obscure\nscenes were easy to understand from a first time viewing. But when I was perplexed (which is not hard) I sat back\nand just let the film play to me, being\nable to enjoy it on a much shallower\nlevel. Never did I find them pretentious\neven if I did at times find them hard.\nIf you go and see these films, you\nwill see a man who grows so fat from his\nprofits that he is unable to move from\nhis pulsating, sweating bed. A violent\ncrash between a cyclist and a car so\ngraphically illustrated that you see his\nbones smash from within as well as\nfrom without. A French kiss in a man's daydreams which changes before your\neyes into the passionate thrusting of\nthe lovers (some time after they moved\non from kissing!)\nHe does not pull any punches. This\nartist is not afraid to deal with con-ten tio us, powerful issues head on and\nclose up.\nIt is also free and only two minutes\naway - go and see it.\n\n"

    "content": "4\nMay\n1999\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST. 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College Sports Fields On Rocky Ground\nA leaked copy of College's Capital Investment Plan for the next five years confirms\nthat a major \"rational is ation\" of Imperial's sports grounds will have to take place\nnext summer. Ostensibly, this has been in preparation for some time (see Felix\n1136), but the report shows that it is\nnow a necessity, which will provide crucial funding for the proposed Sports C en tre redevelopment.\nAccording to the report, which was passed by the last meeting of the College\nCouncil, the total cost of the Sports C en tre project is estimated at \u00a39 million, of which \u00a33 million will come from \"the\nmoney achieved through the rational is ation of the College's sports grounds\",\nfollowing the recommendations of a recent Athletics Committee study, which showed that we currently have around twice as much space as we actually need. As Estates Manager Nick Black put it,\n\"we have one of the largest University\nestates in the UK... if we were starting\nwith a clean sheet today, we would probably build 3 0 % less space. The sports\ncentre at South Kensington is much too By David Roberts\nsmall, yet in contrast we have four out-door sports grounds with about73 hectares in total, which is roughly double what we will ever need\". In order for the project finances to balance, the sale\nmust coincide with the beginning of building work, and the report goes on to\npinpoint the \"release\" at July next year.\nWhilst the Investment Plan docs not\nexplicitly state which ground will be sold\n- and Sports Centre Manager Frank Mur ray is at pains to point out that, at present\n\"all grounds are included in the review...\nany comment would be unsubstantiated\nspeculation\" - a quick look at the figures\nwould seem to point the axe squarely at\nTeddington. If the target figure of \u00a33\nmillion is to be accomplished, then only\nthe sale of teddington or Harlington will\nsuffice, as the combined value of College's other two grounds Warren Farm\n(in Ealing) and Cobham( near Kingston)\n- is far less than the target figure. More over, with a longstanding offer already\nbelieved to be on the table (the old peoples home which bought a small area of the Teddington site some years ago is\nrumored to have a continual interest in\nexpanding), a lucrative sale would be easy to arrange.\nReaction to the proposed sale has\nbeen mixed. Understandably, it will face\nstiff opposition from ICSM, who view Teddington as one of their traditional\nhomes( the ground itself was given to the St Mary's Medical School to provide\na base for its rugby team); ending Tedd ing ton's status as a premier rugby ground would also face stiff opposition from traditionalists, as the ground was once the home of England, and the original pa villi on was the site of the signing\nof the RFU charter. Senior figures in ICU,\nhowever, would appear to view the move as a unavoidable loss which will be massively outweighed by the benefits\nthat the new sports centre will offer. Not so Deputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nelect Tim Trailor, however, who is sticking by his election promise to back keeping Teddington, even if it means delaying\nthe sports centre redevelopment. Despite the fact that in senior College circles the sale is apparently seen as\n\"inevitable\", Mr Murray is keen to point\nout that the exact shape of future sports\nprovisions is still unclear, with his department currently \"investigating all options\nopen to the College to rational is e sports\ng rond provision... these included the possibility that an entirely new ground be found closer to the College to replace\none or more of our existing facilities\".\nIndeed the onc-big-ground concept is a particular favourite of Mr Murray's, and is yet another reason why Teddington is\nfar more likely to be sold than Cobham, as the former offers no scope for exp an sion, whereas the latter could potentially\nbecome a very large site via the purchase of the playing fields currently used\nby GKT Medical School (they too are in\nthe process of rational ising sport pro vi sion, and a sale is expected to take place\nsoon).\nSouthside Barred\nResidents of Southside halls came back from the Easter holidays to find many of their windows had been barred. The alteration, designed to prevent residents from throwing items out of the window, was carried out by Estates over\nthe vacation, with work being completed the day before students returned.\nThe move was a response to various\nincidents over the last few years, and in\nparticular last term, in which nearby residents have suffered near-misses from items being thrown out of hall windows. The issue came to ahead last\nterm, with both ICU President David\nHellard and the Director of Estates, Ian\nCaldwell, warning about the damaged one to the college's reputation by such\naction.\nInterestingly, the students at the centre of the most recent incident were found not guilty at a college tribunal\nand, according to Dr Hassard, Warden of Tizzard Hail, none of those imp li By Ed Sexton\ncate d in previous incidents have been hall residents. In fact in the last two cases it has been students that have\nBolted, but not blocked\nPhoto: Rachel\nhelped tracked down the guilty parties.\nThere are problems with the action,\nhowever. The rooms in question tend to\noverheat, particularly at this time of year. To combat this fans have been installed in all of the affected rooms. I ur-the r more, although the opening of the windows has been severly restricted,\nthere is still a large enough gap to throw\nobjects out of: Dr Hassard agreed, commenting\" I hope people don't test it\nout\". These problems, coupled with an apparent lack of student consultation\nconcerning the scheme, have raised\ndoubts as to the justification and effectiveness of the idea. One student commented \"we have done nothing, but are\nbeing blamed anyway. It makes you wish you lived in your own flat.\"\nWhile denouncing those who threw\nitems out of hall windows, an action he found \"totally incomprehensible\", Dr\nHassard expressed concern over col-leg e's motives,- \"I hope no one's imply-ing our students can't be trusted\". Whether or not they are to blame, it\nappears that it is Southside residents\nthat are being punished.

    "content": "16 Games 4 May 1999\nCivilization - Call to Power (PC)\nActivision\nThose of you who were awake a couple of issues ago will remember that I reviewed a game called Alpha Centauri,\nand rather rashly called it the best game I'd ever played and that if another game came along this year which could com pete with it, I'd strip naked and dance around da Vinci's whipping myself with\na metre length of coaxial cable. Or some thing like that. Our beloved Games Editor says I did, and he wouldn't lie, would he?\nAnyway, he seems to think I might\nhave to make good on my promise, as\nhe's given me a copy of the official Civ2\nfollow-up to review. Civilisation - Call to\nPower is Activision's first crack at this legendary game since they bought Microprose a year or so ago, and they are\ndoubtless hoping for a repetition of the kind of success that saw the original\nCivilisation installed on millions of hard\ndrives across the globe. It's still not officially Civ3 - we're going to have to wait\na bit longer for that - but Is more a sort\nof Civ2-and-a half, an indication of the kind of concepts they will be wanting to\ndevelop in the official followup. Unlike Alpha Centauri, CivilisationCall to Power (or CivCTP\nas I'm going to call it\nfrom now on to save my poor typing finger) covers the same timescale\nas the original Civilisation\ngames; you start as the head of an insignificant\ntribe of nomads, and torn such meagre begin-lo (recite Ihe\ngreatest empire the\nj \u00a3\u00bb world has seen. In the \u2022\nJ* way that will be familiar\nto all of you who have\nplayed any of the preceding Civ games. You do this by founding cities, raising\ntaxes and diverting those taxes into\nresearching technologies. Once you have these new technologies, you develop new and better clubs with which\nto hit your enemies around the head with. You also have the chance to develop your cities, build Wonders of\nthe World and general ly make your\nempire one to rival, well, your rivals.\nOne of the biggest problems faced\nby any games developer when devising\nthe follow up to a game like Civ is where to take it. Sid Meier widely expanded the\ndiplomatic side of the game, but Activision have instead opted for increasing\nthe military side of the game. Normally\nthis would just mean adding a few new units, tweaking the old units and hoping for the best, but Activision, to their credit,\nhave introduced a tactical element to\nthe gameplay. In all the previous versions\nof Civ (including Alpha Centauri), combat\nwas basically a matter of gathering a pile\nof units, and then throwing them against\nyour enemy' s pile until one of the piles\nwas reduced to dust. In CivCTP, a little\nscreen comes up which shows the two armies facing each other, and then enables\nyou the player to select\nwhich of your units is\ngoing to attack which of\nyour enemy's units. The\nidea is an interesting\none, but isn't implemented enough to\nmake any real advance\nin terms of the game'spay ability. There's a good argument for\nadding a tactical combat element to Civ,\nbut it needs to be far more flexible than\nit Is here. Currently it just feels like a momentary( and ultimately rather annoy-ing) distraction from the main business\nof the game. The most obvious difference is the graphics. At a cursory glance, the interface has much more in common with\nAge of Empires than with Civ2 or Alpha Centauri. The units are far better defined\nand anim a te d than both Civ2 and Alpha Centauri, and it is certainly much easier\nto see what is where than in c it her of those two. The city management screens\nhave also been significantly altered, and are much clearer than those in Civ2 or\nAlpha Centauri. Unfortunately this clear\nup has resulted in a loss of information,\nparticularly in terms of the city's pro duc tion capabilities, and this limits the range\nof options available to you. This is unfortunate, as part of the attraction of Civ was the flexibility you had in controlling the manufacturing base of your empire, and in removing the city production information, Activision have removed a fair\nportion of that control.\nThe technology tree has been expanded, particularly at the top end of the tree. In Civ2, the last definite advance\nyou could make was the laser, after\na.9 Si'\nf' \u2022 , .\n;\n:\n;\nvJ.;.:'< si3 fi''';'\"r:'' \u2022fit' \u2022 i* \u2022\n!\n' . ,': . . . . .\nll ll ill!^ f Hill JIH \u2022 mmm ^ *\nwhich you started on undefined \"Future\nTechnologies\". The only benefit to be\ngained from researching these was the\naddition of points to your end score,\nwith the result that most people developed the laser, and then shoved their\nresearch budget down to levels not visible without the aid of an electron micro-scope. Activision have created a set of plausible Future Technologies, all of which give you specific advantages that\nexpand your options a little bit.\nActivision's aims are fairly clear - they\nwanted to improve on the military side\non Civ, something that could benefit\nfrom a little attention - and they should\nbe applauded for their attempt to update\nthe series in this respect. However, by\nconcentrating so much on the military\nside, they have weakened the game as\na whole. CivCFP is a fine piece of soft-ware, and is definitely the equal of Age of Empires (albeit two years younger), but\nthey have limited the options available to\nthe player so much that if you compare it to the possibilities that reside within\nAlpha Cc n tauri, playing CivCTP feels\nrather like playing in a straitjacket at\ntimes. It's sad, but I can'the lp wishing that Sid Meier still had control over the Civilisation brand.\nDanny\nCompo Corner\n-The Results\nLiterally thousands of people entered\nthe War zone2100 and Commandos competition last week well perhaps\nnearer 50.

Here is their experience, lovingly written\nfor all to enjoy. Not good enough for you? Well, you too can experience it for yourself, by entering our crazy competition at the end.\nThe mission was simple, we had been sent out to check\non five scary rides deep in country. We weren't Ihe only\nones out there though. The opposition, student media\ntypes all, would be there too all trying to survive the\ntheme park jungle. It was going to be fun, tough but fun.\nDay 1 - The Black Hole\nRemember when you were young and horror films\nshown in the cinema were really scary but when you see\nit on video during the day it wasn't quite as good. Well\nthese fiends have reversed this process for roller-coast-ers. By covering it up, and not bothering with things like\nlights, it has been turned from a gentle fun ride into a ric tus wide grin moment and a half.\nOne down, four to go both of us came out of that\nwell despite having to suffer Anjit on my lap. Ihe next\ntarget was the Oblivion. Intel reports on this were\nsketchy, it was tall and fast but that's all we had been told.\nDay 4 3 - Oblivion\nThe trek from the exit of the black hole to the entrance\nof the oblivion was\ncompleted as fast\nas we could, to\nstay as dry as pos-sib le. We were\ndoomed to stay\ndry for too long,\nbut we finally\nrealised this when\nthe stinging rain\npricked us in the\nface when the\nOblivion began its\nclimb to the top.\nThe climb was wet, but we soon forgot about the\n/ rain. Intel reports had also\n^ / said that this ride was quick,\nthey failed to mention just how\n*\"/\n~>N \u00bbv it was quick. It is quick, but\nthat is like describing a hurricane as a little\nwindy and wet. From\none hundred and fifty feet up you drop through a steam\nshrouded hole and hurtle underground until the screams\n- a time when even Dr Who could cause slight anxiety\nattacks. We took the cable car to the final two rides. Our\nnemesis awaited.\nDay68 Ripsaw\nand perhaps in hindsight making Anjit ride in the\nfront was a little cruel. But reporting is a cruel game and\nthere was no place for mercy. There was also no time\nfor a second go, the enemy time and the opposition\nwere all that stood between us and the free alcohol err\nmission.\nDay62 The Corkscrew\nThe rush of the oblivion firmly behind us\nwe reached the edge\nof Ug land. Ug land -the land that sun for-got. Base had managed to get some\npictures of the legendary Corkscrew to\nus on the ground. It\nwas, as we expected,\n\u2022 deep within ug-land.\nWe crept under Ihe\ncover of heavy rain, pausing only to cover our tracks using\nthe adolescent life that teems about the larger rides,\nfinally we found the corkscrew - the holy grail of British\nroller-coasters. Over a decade ago this twisty turn ey thing first started to scare as only a twisty turn ey rollercoaster can. Time hasn't been gentle to this old lady of\ntwist, and even an j it came away with a sense of un for fill ment. It was still fun, the triple corkscrew bit was still\ntwisty & turn ey but we had all been much younger then\nThis was going to be the wet one. Every theme park was\nat least one and this was the latest Alton Towers attempt\nto drench the unsuspecting punter. The ripsaw was\nih ought up by someone whose idea of a good time was\nputting a fountain underneath a fast spinning bench. Out\nnerves, shot to pieces by the cable car, liked the calming effect the harness that locked us firmly in had. We\nmight never be spawn children or speak quite as deeply\never again but we were firmly held as the bench was\nspun and rocked. We took the soaking well, possibly\nbecause we were already wet. The spinning though was\nsevere. For the first time my veteran's stomach was\nchurning-just a little. Four down, one to go. We had to\nface nemesis to complete our mission.\nDay 69 - Nemesis\nWe were finally here, the nemesis, the scary one. From\nthe moment the harness comes down\nand the floor drops\naway we realised that\nit was still the nastiest\npiece of work in the\npark. The Oblivion is\nbig and quick, the\nblack hole scary but\nthe Nemesis is just\ndown right evil. The\narcing left hand turns\nall lead up to a loop\nwhere only half of it is above ground level. All of this\nwhile sitting on a seat which has the friction content of\na freshly shl ned burger bar plastic special, allowing you\nto dangle and swing your feet in fresh, un supporting air.\nEvil, pure and unadulterated minute madness. The grin\nfrom Anjit after he got off this one worried me for a few\nminutes though after a few slaps he regained enough\ncomposure to race to the evacuation point.\nCompetition\nThanks to those lovely people at Beat's^ wax, we have five pairs of tickets for\nI Alton Towers to give away, valid until\nthe Autumn. The only catch is\nthat we can't provide travel\nfor you. \"So where is it?\" I hear you cry!

This\n\u2022 was apparently due to an application for\nthe same slot, made several months ago by another organisation. Although dis-appointed, IC Radio will continue to look\nfor the opportunity to obtain an RSL in\nthe future.\nComedy Interlude\nThis Friday, 7 May, sees the 1999 Daily\nTelegraph Open Mic Awards Semi Finals\ncome to ICU. The semi-finals are the climax in the comedy nights organised at\nstudents' unions throughout the a cade mic year. From the sixty contestants competing, ten will be chosen to go through to the Grand Final, held at the Edinburgh\nFestival in August. The winner receives\n\u00a32000, and more importantly the chance to appear at a selection of comedy clubs\nand festivals.\nThe other semi-finals are being held\nat student unions around the country\nthroughout May. Edinburgh, Warwick In bi\nand Liverpool Guild are hosting the com petition this week, along with Imperial,\nwith Cardiff on9 May and Brunei on13 May completing the listings.\nSummerball Update\nLast week's article concerning the Summer Ball (\"Success for IC's Second Ball\",\nFelix 1142), which stated that tickets went on sale on Friday 30 May, was incorrect.\nThe date should have been Friday 30\nApril, meaning that tickets are on sale\nnow, from the Union Office( \u00a355 for stu-dents, \u00a365 for staff). It would be helpful\nfor the organisers if students decided who they want to sit with before they\nbook tickets.\nSunday Studies\nThere are plans to open the Central\nLibrary on Sundays for IC students only.\nThe arrangement is set to start early next\nmonth in order to cover the examination\nperiod. The proposal is currently being processed and it is likely the new op e ning times will last until the end of this\nterm and then be re-implemented for the\nnew academic year.\nCircle Line Closure\nFor those of you who don't already know,\nthe circle line is going to be closed between High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road for much of the sum mer. The nine weeks of engineering works begins on12 June, lasting until 15\nAugust, and is necessary to strengthen\nthe tunnel that runs between the two sta-t ions. The work will also affect other services between High Street Kensington\nand Edgware Road, although bus services should be in cres ed to minimise the disruption.\nICSM Football Finish 3rd Following on from last week's revelations about the ICSM Football Firsts being stripped of their First Division title, the\nresults of the appeal have now come to\nlight. ICSM appealed on the grounds that they had been informed that Dr\nHoughton was eligible for registration, as\nhe is a research student. I low ever, UL\nhave decided that he is, nonetheless,\nin el lig ble for selection, and their original\ndecision - which leaves ICSM in third,\nwith GKT taking the title and promotion has been upheld. Pugwash Comes to IC\nA now society at Imperial, Student\nPugwash, are holding their first meeting this week. Pugwash is a well-known international organisation concerned with\nglobal problems and social and ethical\nissues. It encourages scientists and engineers to take responsibility for their own actions. Pugwash, and its president\nJoseph Rotblat, received the Nobel Peace\nPrize in 1995 for their efforts towards\nnuclear disarmament. Joseph Rotblat will\ngive the first lecture at the IC group.\nFhe IC group aims to raise awareness\nof our responsibility to help reduce and, when possible, eliminate the actual and\npotential harmful effects of scientific and\ntechnological research. Areas that will\nbe discussed in this and future meetings\ninclude arms control and disarmament,\nsustainable environments and other ethical issues. For more information on the\ninternational organisation, see www.pug-wash.org, Ihe IC meeting will be this\nThursday (6 May) at 1 pm in the Brown\nCommittee Room( third floor of the\nUnion), lor more information contact\nCarstcn on x46676 or email student-pug-wash@ic.ac.uk.\njust pop down to tower records on\nkensington high st. and produce\nyour Union card at the counter.\n\u2022offer ends 30/06/99.\n\u2022excludes already discounted sale product,\n\u2022offer applies to the kensington store only.\n\n"

    "content": "8 Columns 4 May 1999\nWill Sheffield have a Ball?\nOh, you're back, are you? Apologies to all of those champing at the bit last week, expecting this column, but the truth Is that I had got so used to you being away, it completely slipped my mind. Ah, how easily they forget! Anyway, here we are, the final term for many of you, the final\nterm for this column( don't pop the champagne corks just yet in Suite Five\n- I'm going out with a bang not a whim per) and the beginning of the end of student life. Of course, there is the small matter of exams before all that,\nbut since you' ve all spent every waking minute of the holidays with your nose in a textbook, that should be a for-mali ty. And while we're on the subject,\nwhat better way to cap your time at IC\nthan a night at Alexandra Palace for the Summer Ball!\nThe inaugural event last year was a tremendous success, and Iam sure that this time the standard will be even higher. However, last year's ball proved a bit simpler from a funding perspective, thanks to the wondrous generosity of EDS, conveniently run by a College alumnus. Though efforts this\nyear seem to be proceeding well, Iam very surprised by the College attitude to sponsorship. As the committee suggest, such an event is a marvellous showcase for Imperial, which could in future prove to be a valuable forum for forging and strengthening industrial\nlinks. Therefore a contribution from College to ensure that such an event achieves the necessary prestige and quality does not seem to much to ask As we have come answer was no and reason was woolly and far from true.\nCertainly, the Deputy Rector can't dish out money from his fund, but\nthe Pro-Rector (Edu-cation al Quality) can and does, through the Union sub vent ion, the Stud ent Counsellor funding and the Warden's entertainment budget, none of which are counted as academic expenditure. I find It amazing that a couple of thousand could not be directed from or\nthrough his accounts. Nobody would seek to get College to bankroll the event; the Rector himself said last year\nthat that would probably be a disaster.\nMaking such a donation would keep our friends in S her field at a safe dis-t ance, but would send out the signal that we are really serious about this.\nSaid Pro-Rector, Tim Clark, is a thor-ough ly decent chap, so I'm sure a word in his ear will reap dividends. Warning: Silly Fire Signs Ahead\nSi\nVoice of Reason\nto expect, the \"Though [the fire\nalarm] is religiously\ntested every Thursday\n(a priest performs the\nLast Rites), every man\nand his dog knows it\nhas all the reliability of\na chocolate teapot.\"\ntop me if you' ve heard this\nbefore. No, don't, because to the best of my knowledge, this is\nthe millionth time I 've had a rant about the fire\nalarms in this\nplace. Just\nwhen you think it can't get anymore ridiculous, somebody in\nCollege does something of such breathtaking idiocy that\nyou can'the lp but laugh. As regular read ers will know, the alarm in my own department has been anything but a laughing matter for as long as anyone can remember. Though it is religiously\ntested every Thursday( a priest per-forms the Last Rites), every man and his dog knows it has all the reliability\nof a chocolate teapot. So why not fix\nit? Not possible, dear reader, because we don't have any money. Fair enough. After\nall, we' ve built a lot\nof granite horticultural features this\nyear. So why has my beloved department been defaced with stupid 'safety' signs designed to serve the needs of the educationally subnormal, the concentration of whom is\nfairly low on my side of Queen's Lawn.\nApparently, those little red glass-fronted boxes on the wall, bearing the words FIRE SMASH GLASS' are 'Fire\nAlarm Call points.' Well, bugger me! You cannot imagine how much more soundly I sleep at night armed with\nthat knowledge. It gets better. You know those wall mounted, rolled-up\nhose pipe thing ies dotted around cam pus? I, like most of you, thought that\nSimon Baker\nthey were for watering the plants. Oh no, they are actually 'fire Hose Reels.'\nSo no more dousing the spider plants\nwith that pressure hose. This may seem a trivial point, but the upshot of all this is a department that looks like\na showroom for Bleed in' Obvious Sign age f td, and the waste of a large\namount of time and money. There are nearly 30 on my floor alone, mean|ing that this\nI is going to I mean serious1 money ColI leg e wide at\nI over a fiver a '\u2022 time. The rea-| son I know I this is\nI because in November1998, a company selling this rubbish I sent me their\nj catalogue I out of the I blue. The j Sunday1 Time s'Tar a Palmer Tom pk ln son gets jewel encrusted underwear, I get the Autumn1998 Seton Select Catalogue. I know my place.\nIn a League of its own...\nunwilling to increase funding, they should free up institutions to pursue their own funding and make them 'less\nregulated.' Sound blok e. Even more oddly, his name was also Sir Ron. Given\nthe stifling bureaucracy under which the academic activities of Imperial oper-ate, a system that delays, distracts, irritates and frustrates, consuming disproportionate resources that should be better spent making this place the best university in the country, it surely\ncan't be the Rector, unless of course the message of this column is finally\ngetting through. And Finally, the News\nVInA \u00ab\nnot her day, another league table. Imperial, after consolidating our runner-up position in the FT survey, has now been accorded second position in\nThe Times. The stalwarts of the IC\nDistorter ' Media Mentions' column must be wetting themselves on account of Sir Ron appearing in every\npublication from the Evening Standard\nto Exchange& Mart. Always a banker for a good quote, the Rector said great\nthings about IC and our superiority over Oxford. He did us proud and we all deserve a pat on the back. Now I always thought Ox burgh was a fairly\nunusual surname but, by amazing coincidence, I recently read comments by\na similarly sur named gentleman. This\nOx burgh, in response to suggestions that the UK university sector was slip-ping behind our American cousins, said\nthat if the Government were unable or\n\"Prince William is now a 'social smoker', as\nopposed to a smoker\nwho stubs his fags out\non people's foreheads.\"\n\" here seems to be a very disparate\nrange of people In the news at the\nmoment. First up we have the case of Mr Johnnie Walker( the DJ\nrather than the indifferent Scotch). The\nNews of the World, birthplace of the\nLate Voice of Reason Senior, has made a terrible fuss about the whole sordid\naffair, as is their wont. Now I would be the last person to condone his behaviour, but should we really be surprised\nthat someone who works for Radio 2\nfinds the need to take powerful stimulants? What next? Jimmy Young on speed? We have also learnt that Prince\nWilliam is now a 'social smoker', as\nopposed to a smoker who stubs his\nfags out on people's foreheads, I pre-s ume. Needless to say, wish y was hy liberals and health fascists the length\nand breadth of the country have decried his actions, saying he has damaged his position as a positive role\nmodel. Nonsense. He has decided that\nhe will not be forced unswerving ly into\nan image created for him by the media,\nthus doing himself an enormous credit,\n'regardless of the rights or wrongs of the odd crafty\nMarlboro. And finally, a bit closer\nto home, the Director of finance, Mike Hansen, is in the news. We are los-ing him to King's, and a very grave loss it is for Imperial.\nSince the news broke, my phone has-n't stopped, jammed by people pleading for help in making him change his\nmind. Most moving was the emotion choked voice of the Rector, begging for\nsolutions to this problem. We must have got cutoff before he had a chance to reply to my suggestion of\nmore money, but there you go. Congratulations on the new job, you will be\nmissed. But if all other efforts to per-sua de you fail, I suppose I could always\ndig out those photos...\n\n"

    "content": "4 May 1999 Editorial 7\nTo Regulate or Not?\nThe complete lack of news this week\n(come on, you don't really expect me to\ntalk about sports grounds at this time in\nthe morning, do you?) has forced me to\nlook elsewhere for inspiration for this\ncolumn. And, fortunately, I didn't have\nto look far - as far as Darshan's website,\nin fact (see last letter opposite). Ignoring for the moment the somewhat egotistical content of said site (in fact, let's ignore it all together), and without any\ncomment on the designer's HTML skills,\nbrowsing through the pages reminded\nme of a subject that has received little\nattention in Felix; the regulation of the\nInternet.\nRecent events across the Pond\nhave led to many clam our ing for tighter\nregulation of information on the inter-net. After all, we all know that you can\nfind cake, love and bomb making manuals on the web - and so can your kids.\nAdmittedly regulation is getting better,\nand Internet Explorer 5 has a whole\nrange of options to prevent unauthorised access to certain sites, but it is up\nto the computer administrator to\nenforce these rules. Given that most\nkids know more about the family PC\nthan their parents, it is not really a viable solution.\nWhat I dislike most is the argument\nthat it must be the kids who are\nscrewed up, and it Is not the fault of the\nInternet or anyone else. Why can't we\njust accept that humans are naturally\ninquisitive, especially when young, and\nhave a tendency towards violence and\n'moral' wrong? Show teenagers how to\nmake a bomb, they'll do it. Give students a gun, they'll use it. Comments\nplease.\nIs it Right to have Rights?\nAnother angle on the high-school\nkillings is the fallacy of a bill of rights,\nfor a long time I was very keen on the\nidea, and couldn't believe Britain didn't have an equivalent, but I 've changed\nmy mind. Consider this. When the Constitution was drawn up it seemed perfectly sensible that every American\nshould have the right to defend his\nhome - in those days homes needed\ndefending, and even the most peaceful family would be advised to keep a gun handy.\nTwo centuries on, however, that\nneed has diminished, and the ease\nwith which guns can be purchased is\ncertainly not good for social cohesion.\nYet America is tied to an outdated con-st it uti on, which can be quoted by every\ngun fanatic as a basic human right,\nmaking it very difficult to pass amendments and change the status quo. It\nmay seem a good idea to draw up\nsome basic moral rights that will hold\nfor all time, but it is actually shooting\nyourself in the foot (no pun intended).\nFor what is morally right for one society\nat one time is not right for all societies\nat all times - and clearly the use (and\nmisuse) of guns In America is not good\nfor anyone, except gun shop owners.\nIn the News this Week...\nWell, it seems there was some news\nafter all. Commlsserations to IC Radio\nfor not obtaining their one month FM\nlicense -1 hope that it will not dissuade\nfuture committees from re-applying. As\nfor the windows in Southside halls, this\ndoes seem a little draconian, and somewhat pointless. Given that it is not generally the student residents that have\nbeen at fault, and that you can still\nthrow stuff out of them, I see little\nvirtue in barring them. The total cost of\nthe operation, Including the fans, must\nbe enormous. Perhaps a poster campaign around hall, with the words\n'Those found throwing items out of\nwindows will be fined \u00a3500' would be\nmore effective. If you were going to do it, it would have been nice to consult\nthe students before hand.\nA small plug next, for the Open\nMic Semis this friday. It should be a good evening, with a decent slice of\ncomedy, so I would recommend it to all\nand sundry. Telegraph and other journalists will be there, which obviously Is\na plus point for us here in the felix\nOffice, and the evening looks like being\nhighly enjoyable.\nIn the News next Week...\nI completely forgot to mention it last\nweek, but Saturday May 1 was the\nCannabis Coalition's protest march from\nBrixton Hill to Clapham Common( no,\nthe irony of that sentence isn't lost on\nme either). Anyway, I hope anyone that\nwent enjoyed themselves, as well as\ngetting involved in the serious debates\nthat were going on - there'll be a full\nreport in next week's news (assuming,\nthat is, that I remember to write it). If\nyou did go, and have any cool photos\nof the afternoon, I would like to hear\nfrom you, preferably before this\nWednesday evening. Anonymity pre-served, of course... - Ed\nTickets are available NOW! from the union office\n\n"
