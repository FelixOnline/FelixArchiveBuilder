Under Pressure\nThe scoring was opened by\nRory Lewis with a fine long-range shot and he had a second goal disallowed shortly\nafterwards. Unfortunately, however, IC did not capital is e on a temporary two-man\nadvantage and towards the\nend of the quarter it was the\nIC goalkeeper, Ian Bales, who\nwas at the receiving end of the\nattacks.\nQuick Reply\nA quick team shuffle in the\ninterval brought Ko staR i bar in goal to replace Ian.

A few\nminutes later, Cotter, who created a personal record in this match by actually passing\nthe ball, beat several opponents\nto score a fine try, which he\nthen converted.

Nevertheless the forwards\nbegan to dominate their\nopposition, and from a set scrum, scrum-half Price Stevens made a break on the\nblind side to put Gresory\nthrough for a try.\nMeanwhile, Gilbert was crash tackling anything that\nmoved, even his own side. Heath, in his first match\nback after injury, scored a good try by running 50 yards, jumping on their fullback and\nfalling on the ball ( ! ! rEd). Middlesex then hit back with another try.

    "content": "2 - FELIX, NOVEMBER 5th1976 letters to the editor\nDear Editor, \u2014 May I make a few comments on the proposed\nL instead Extension. Firstly, on reading last weeks article, the most elegant and appealing\nscheme was clearly that of the\nKnightsbridge Association. Be sides providing accommodation\nwhich normal human beings\nwould enjoy living in, as opposed to the 'rabbit warrens'\nwhich students are expected\nto live in, the scheme also \u2022\nprovides for extending the\npresent sports facilities and maintaining the space available for parking.\nUnfortunately the scheme\nhas many equally clear d is advantages. The cost would\nprobably be prohibitive, and the low rise aspect does not\nmeet with the DAP W CC's idea\nof boxing the Gardens into\nanother of London's typical f?) squares.\nAlthough clearly aimed at\nkeeping within the budget, the\nCollege proposals seem to show a complete absence of\nany new thoughts in design. It appears to mirror the present\nL instead design \u2014 with the\ntop chopped off to save the\nexpense, and the exterior\ntar ted up a bit to give it a newer look \u2014 and add to the\nexpense.\nThe final scheme, proposed\nby Wiggins and Gardiner, I feel is totally ludicrous. Having been privileged enough to see\ntheir plans \u2014 which appear\nto be newly incomprehensible\n\u2014 Is hall point out my main\npoints of objection.\na) The tennis courts and car park are used indiscriminately\nwithout any thought of re plac ing these facilities. b) The space available\nwould limit the size of the\ncourtyards, making them into\nun social wastage s of space\nand only useful for accumulating\nlitter.\nc) The courtyards could only\nbe centres of social activity if\nwarm and well lit \u2014 impossible\nin the population density\nsuggested.\nI have been unable to see\nany advantages in their\nscheme whatsoever.\nOne final point on the\npresent, and proposed density\nof population: whilst high\ndensity is obviously, favoured\nfinancially ( especially when\nspace is limited), a density\neven as high as at present can only lead to a feeling of\nim personality and a lack of\nrespect for the property. This leads directly to vandalism, or\nat least misuse of the available\nfacilities, and a corresponding\nreduction in useful lifetime.\nPlease Mess rs Wiggins and Gardiner and whoever is responsible for the college\nplans, rethink and consider\nthe quality of life of all\nStudents and Mews residents\na like. H. CHEE THAM Met Post Grad. Dear Sir, \u2014 You report that\nI have \" extensively lobbied...\nagainst the height of the new\nbuilding and the density of student numbers\". The truth is that I have\nmade argued representations\nin writing, all of them accessible to Imperial College, and not against numbers \u2014\nthe right number in my opinion\nis the largest number compatible\nwith good environment and good architecture \u2014 but\nsolely against the suitability\nof the proposal to all human\ninhabitants of the neighbour-hood, whether student or\nnon-student. Evidently every\ncouncillor * was persuaded\nthat the building would\naggravate and reinforce the\nharsh and overpowering\nquality of what is already in the square; destroy the light\nand air which demolition on\nDear Sir, \u2014 There has been\nmuch debate over the attempt\nby Imperial College Students'\nUnion to sell the National Student Discount Scheme below\nthe NUS recommended price\nof \u00a32.00.\nWe are just one of many\nsmall colleges who have\ninvested a considerable\nproportion of our total income\ninto the NSDS scheme. We\nare attempting to increase\nthe income of our union by\nselling these cards and\nreceiving commission from\nNUS for the cards that we sell. If Imperial College Students' Union begin selling their cards cheaper than we\ncan,( If we sell them at that\nprice it is not worth us\nselling them), then we will be\nunable to sell our cards to\nthe east has fortuitously\ncreated in a potentially\ndark p'. ace; and result in a massive infringement of\ndaylighting regulations at\nPhase Three (not given in your pretty picture), an infringement from which IC students would principally suffer. My low-rise (3'/2 storey)\nalternative could house more\nstudents for your \u00a3350,000,\nand could house more students\nmore cheaply and more quickly in subsequent phases. If the College had heeded\nproperly the summer meeting\nof the Town Planning Committee, it could have\npredicted the refusal it has suffered.\nDAVID WIGGINS\nProfessor of Philosophy Bedford College8 November 1976\nthe students from our college\nbecause they will just go to\nImperial.\nOur total investment in the\nNSDS scheme is \u00a3500 and\nwe cannot afford to have unsold cards and handbooks,\nI sincerely hope that Imperial\nUnion decide to forget about\nthis idea because it will cause severe financial difficulties to small unions\nsuch as ours, and that they\naccept that NUS had their\nreasons, (this is only one),\nin fixing the price of the\nNSDS Cards at \u00a32.00,\nYours \u00ab ince rely, STEVE WILLIAMS, President.\nHammersmith & West London\nCollege Students' Union.8 November1976 Your paper?\nDear Sir, \u2014 As the three\nstudents who share the\nwriting of FELIX Theatre\nreviews, may we reply \" to\nMr Davey' s extraordinary\nattack in last week's issue?\nWe would not seek to disagree with his contention\nthat better qualified critics can be read in the national\npress. What we aim to do is to\ngive a students' eye view of productions; if we sometimes\nsound pretentious then we apologise, it is unintentional.\nIt is unfortunate that Mr\nDavey should draw comparisons\nbetween our aspirations and his Olympic qualifications.

On Sunday Bo' again\nsuccessfully completed the trip, but had an\nunusual number of problems, resulting in a late\narrival for lunch at the Nevill House Hotel.\nBo' left Hyde Park at 8.20am amidst a deafening Boomalaka from hordes of Guilds &\nL 'Institut Francais supporters. Two coach-loads of supporters later saw Bo' arrive in Brighton.\nDespite the initially warm and sunny weather,\ntrouble was soon at hand. Engine overheating\ncaused Bo' to stop at Streatham for more water.\nHis (Bo's) passage was further hampered by a surfeit of spectators who caused long delays\nand traffic queues.\nA mysterious lack of engine power, which\nrestricted the use of the two top gears, also\nslowed the party down.\nOur next misfortune was the weather; by\nRedhill heavy rain showers (and hail) had\nsoaked and frozen the bedraggled crew, which\nincluded the Rector. The latter had thought of\nsuch eventualities, and lessened our sorrows\nwith a bottle of 'purified water',which looked &\ntasted suspiciously like whisky. Another\nhelping hand came from an umbrella passed\ndelicately by Dave Willey's wife from her\nAustin Seven to Bo'.\nAnother stop to check the water-level and\nBo' managed to crawl into Brighton. At this\npoint the engine started behaving itself and\ntop gear was used to take Bo' triumphantly\nacross the finishing line at 30mph. The Bo' crew collected their medal, went\nfor lunch and met three previous Bo' drivers,\nwho'd arrived three hours earlier. Then came\nthe traditional team outing on the dodge ms, the return journey \u2014 with Bo' safely on its\ntrailer \u2014 and the traditional drink in the Union\nBar. We're now looking to next v ear.

    "content": "FOUNDED IN 1949\nNEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nNo. 434 Friday,12 November, 1976 FREE! Action taken on overseas\nstudents\nMeasures are to be taken to create a new Union major\nsub-committee (of Union Council) to cover overseas\nstudent affairs. The move came at an informal meeting on\nWednesday evening, designed to revamp interest in the\nUnion's ailing Overseas Students Committee (OSC);\nThe meeting was convened\nby Academic Affairs Officer\nPaul Ekpenyong and External Affairs Officer Hugh Barrett,\nboth of whom had become\ndeeply concerned that the\nOS C's nine elected posts\nwere all vacant. These should\nhave been filled in March. Low level of activity\nThe two were also perturbed\nabout the absence of an\nOverseas Students Fresher s reception and the low level\nof activity among overseas\nstudents on the issues affecting them. This they\nfound disturbing in the wake\nof increasing constraints on\noverseas students studying\nin the UK. 'IC is one of the\nfew colleges not openly\ninvolved in fighting these\nconstraints and supporting\nthe NIJS campaign on overseas\nstudents' said Paul Ekpenyong.\nThe unanimous decision to scrap the existing committee\nwas taken by an invited group\nof foreign students comprising\nleaders of ICU's national\nsocieties and others interested\nin promoting overseas student\nactivity. Under the plan\ndevised on Wednesday, these\nsocieties would come under\nthe jurisdiction of the new\nsub-committee,,\nNew proposals\nThe plan would el tec t iv ely fuse the aims and organisation\nof the S CC national societies with those of the existing Students Committee, to\nproduce a cohesive voice for\noverseas students. The\nmeeting acknowledged that\nthe present system failed to\nbind individual a cn ive national societies together\non the issues common to all overseas students.\nThe sub-committee would\nbe represented on Council by\nits chairman. Its composition\nwould be the chairmen of the\nnational societies and elected representatives of overseas\nstudents.\nExecutive backing\nThe proposals have yet to\nbe finalised and will have to\nbe approved by Union Council and General Meetings. Initial\nUnion reaction has been\nfavourable and informed sources believe the idea will receive ascent, in principle, at next week's Executive meeting. President Nick Brayshaw and S CC Chairman\nAlan Lodge have already\nwelcomed the proposals. Action committee\nAn ad hoc' Overseas Students Activists Committee'\nwas set up at the meeting.\nThis body will decide the\nexact formal structure of the\nnew sub-committee and present\nits proposals to Council. It is hoped the Activists Committee\nwill also instigate new\nenthusiasm in overseas student affairs, publicise the\nmain issues affecting these\nstudents and devise preliminary arrangements for next\nyear's fresher s' reception.\nFood prices to\nstay constant\nThe College Refectory\nCommittee decided last week\nto recommend to the Governing\nBody that refectory prices remain at their present level after Christmas. Suggestions\nthat the Committee look\ndeeply into what the customer\nwants from the catering\nservice were welcomed by\nchairman, Professor E il on. He has asked the Union to conduct\na survey to determine this.

The building is named after Thomas Huxley, a professor in\nBiology, who was Dean of RCS and RSM from 1881 \u2014 1895.\nSir Adrew is the grandson of Thomas Huxley.\nThe new building houses the departments of Maths,\nPhysics and Computing & Control.\nBrunei reject Izzy\nIzzy, the six foot high fibreglass dinosaur captured by IC students over the summer, will not be returning to its original owners, Brunei University Students Union. The Executive of\nBrunei Union has told Izzy' s captors that his Union does not\nintend to meet the conditions laid down for the mascot's return.\nThese included the payment\nof \u00a350 to the IC Rag charities\nand the donation of 150 pints\nof blood by Brunei students,\nall by November 1st. The mascot's captors had been\nprepared to extend the dead-line, but this suggestion was rejected by the Brunei\nExecutive.

    "content": "NEWSPAPEH OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nOverseas Students\nI was disheartened that no member\nof the Union Executive attended the\nOverseas Students meeting on\nWednesday (see front page).- It was\ndoubly sad, since over the summer\nvacation, I had heard many ideas\nfrom the Exec, aimed at increasing\noverseas student participation in\nIC Union. Overseas students form\n25% of Union membership. They now\nface special problems which threaten\ntheir community at IC. The situation\ndeserves closer attention from ICU.\nIt is hardly encouraging to active\noverseas students to see no lead\ngiven by the Executive, three of\nwhom sit on the ailing Overseas\nStudents Committee.\nRefectories\nIn October 1975 a40% refectory\nprice increase dramatically cut\nMooney's custom. The Refectory\nCommittee has seen its error and\nproposes no increases for next term.\nIts new found policy of finding out\nwhat students want from the catering\nsystem is welcome, but long overdue.\nThere seems to be no problem at the\nUnion refectory, where every lunchtime\nthe queue trails out of the re fec. door\nand across the foyer. Congratulations\nto Mr Mooney on this one, at least.\nBy the way, if you don't like the\nqueues, the Union Bar serves sandwiches in the Lower Lounge at\nlunchtimes. Hot meals at weekends\nare also on the cards.\nReturning the Compliment\nThe RCS Union General Committee\ndecided on Monday that the ICU,\nICWA, C& GU and RSMU Presidents\nwould only get a single complimentary\nticket to the RCS Silwood Ball.\nFormerly they had received a double\nticket. At, say, \u00a315 a double ticket\nfor this year's formal balls, double\ncompliment aries add \u00a360 to the\nevent's bill ie: \u00a31 to each double\nbought for Silwood, the ICWA Ball &\nMines Ball, and at least 50pa double\nfor Guilds Dinner and Dance. Including\nFELIX, NOVEMBER12 th19763 Freshers' Dinners compliment aries, \u00a3350 is 'spent' on free tickets; most\nof the tickets are used by the five\nPresidents. Numbers at formal balls\nare dropping because of the ticket\nprice ... the solution seems obvious.\nApoligies\nSorry about the state of last week's editorial, the rush to get FELIX to\nyou prevented accurate proof reading\nhere. Apologies too to Mr Davey,\nwhose name got spelt three different\nways.\nDue to a slight cock-up by myself\nthe Rag edition of FELIX will now\nbe sold on 3rd December. Next week's edition will photo - preview Rag Week.\nThanks to Omega, the Herriot-Watt\nUniversity paper, for allowing us to\nuse the dalek cartoon last week.\nMany thanks to Gill McConway, Ian\nMorse, Jen Hardy-Smith, Mark Kuse,\nHoward Cheetham, Chris Palmer,\nDuncan Suss, Trevor Poole, Terry\nWestoby, Andrew Evans, Dave Crabb,\nAlison, Mike Slone-Murphy, Jon Lor\u2014,\nTony. Jones and John O 'Leary. Ta too\nanyone else I 've forgotten.\nletters continued\u00ab \u2022\u00bb\nL plates for lunacy\nDear Sir, \u2014 With reference to\nyour article headed \" Mascot Wrangles\", in FELIX No.432, we would like to make\nseveral points.\nJohn Elk in, guild sheet editor, did drive his vehicle\nat the RCS fresher s, and\ncontinued to drive backwards\nand forwards, hitting numerous\npeople. As Mr Elk in was reversing, presumably for\nanother attempt at the crowd,\na wine waiter removed his ignition keys for the safety\nof all persons present. Theta\nthen entered the dinner across\nthe bonnet of the guilds car\nas it was now blocking the\ndoors.\nImmediately after the\nincident, guilds maintained\nthat Mr Elk in had not rammed\nthe fresher s and that he\nalways drove at speed around\nthis area at that time of night\nanyway. However in the light\nof overwhelming evidence to\nthe contrary, he later told\nRCS that he 'DELIBERATELY\nRAMMED THE FRESHERS\nBECAUSE HE THOUGHT\nTHAT HiS FRIENDS WERE\nIN TROUBLE.'\nThe whole incident was viewed by a least two\nmembers of the guilds exec, VicePresident,' Dave Lord\nand Hon Sec, Mike Wheatley,\nwho were both waiting, along\nwith a number off guilds man, in the Lyon P lay fair library.\nOn noticing that minimal\ndamage had occured to Mr\nElk in' scar, Mr Wheatley\nsaid 'RCS are going to pay\nfor this'. We would like to\npoint out that damage to\ncars can be paid for (although\nwe have no intention of doing\nso in this instance) damage\nto people cannot.\nThings may have been\ndifferent had an attitude,\nsimilar to Mr Elk in' s, been\ntaken by R CSU, and the J4 van been used to prevent\nMr Elk in from ramming RCS fresher s escorting Theta. Mr Elk in may not have been\nquite so happy had the' J4( a somewhat larger vehicle)\nrammed him when the driver\n'saw that his buddies were\nin trouble'!\nThe Royal College of\nScience Union feel that the\nwhole point of Mascots\nattending Fresher s Dinners\nhas been put in jeopardy by\ncontinued aggravation during\nthis year's events. During\nthe first dinner, road blocks\ncomprising 50gal oil drums,\nbreeze blocks, milk-crates,\nroad signs and scaffolding\npoles were placed across\ncollege roads in an attempt\nto prevent Theta from leaving\ncollege, they would have\nworked had they not been\nnoticed during the dinner, as they were placed in such\npositions as to be likely to\ncause vehicles to crash. Members of guilds, who have\ndriven spanner to and from\ndinners in the past, agreed\nthat this ' was b latent ly dangerous and could have\ncaused serious injury and\npossible loss of life.\nAt the third dinner ( Life Sciences), Mr Elk in was seen\non more than one occasion to be driving past the window\nof the dinner at speed,\nspoiling the at mosh per e of\nthe dinner for many people.\nAlthough we do not\nobject, in principle, to\nvalid efforts by guilds to\nsteal Theta, we feel that\nby definition, mascot ry should be good-humour ed activity, with no real violence\nand definately no actions\nwhich could endanger life\nor limb. RCS will continue\nto follow these guidelines, may we hope that guilds come\nto their senses before the\nwhole thing gets out of\nproportion.\nWe would like to close with a 'warning' quote from\na guilds man heavily involved\nwith spanner at a subsequent\nguilds dinner: 'We'd better\n/ Editor Clive Dewey>\nnot have any trouble tonight\nor we'11 call the police'.\nYours in anticipation of\nmany rumblings from Mr Lord and crew.\nSteve Braund\nV PR CSU Dave Dodge\nAssist. Hon Sec\nR CSU Right groove\nDear Sir, \u2014 How glad I was to read your expose in the October\n21s tissue. It was refreshing to\nsee reality in print. The popular music scene is definitely, sadly anti-truth,\npro-illusionist and a continuing\nnegative in a progressive world.\nLet us see a more detailed\nexpose of where it's really at\nwith the music industry \u2014 how\nsales of advertising space in music papers is linked with\nreviews of gigs, concerts,\nsingles and albums releases, and how double-page spread\n\" editorials\" are sold at a price.\nAnd let us have an expose\nof the singles market hype \u2014\nwhere chart material is manufactured with certainty of\nsuccess, with full awareness of\nbad content disregarded in favour of the knowledge of\nfinancial profit to be gained\nalong the routes of planned\nmarketing cons. Not forgetting\nthe vulnerability of childrens'\nminds, nor that they have no\nchoice in what they buy, for\nlinks exists between discos, retail shops and the charts.\nThe recording companies have\ngot it all in their control.\nI would be glad to see you reveal the existence of the\nmultitude of good, professional\nmusicians in London and around,\nand the true artist who struggles\nagainst all odds, of whom the\npublic are hardly likely to hear\nof because of the company-policy-directed, restricted, hype-minded, frustrated, psu edo musical dreamers who front the\nrecording companies, who will not lay then selves on the line\nfor fear of losing the job. K.M. Girdler (Miss)\nChemistry Dept\nOct 2 6 , 1976\nInconsiderate\nDear Sir, \u2014 Everyday I come\ninto College by car, and to\ndate have had no problems in\nparking (I do have a College Parking permit). I was rather\namazed to find a car displaying a disabled person's sticker\nfetter with an orange day glow\n'Thou Shalt Not. Park' label\nstuck on its windscreen.\nThe nature of the (car)\nowner's disability made it\nimpossible for him to remove\nthe sticker without a great\ndeal of help from the College road sweeper. I realise that\ncar parking is limited, but\nsurely compassion should be\nshown in certain cases. Yours sincerely,\nRon Parker\nMessenger\nOld RCS Building "

    "content": "FELIX, NOVEMBER 12th19769 Exiled boys a Croydon hit\nWishbone Ash at Fairfield\nAt 10.11pm on Sunday\nevening Laurie Wisefield\nraised his hands in the air,\nlooked aloft at the large\ncrowd rapidly festooning itself\naround the stage, and asked\neveryone to clap along to the\nfirst of two encores 'Bad\nWeather Blues'.\nHe had no need to worry,\nCroydon had proved a good\ngig for Wishbone Ash, whose\nyear of exile' in America has\nproduced a tighter and more\nhard hitting ' Ash than I had\nhitherto seen.\nThe lads play with more\nvehemence now than when I last saw them, at Reading\nFestival in 1975. They can turn on the tender tones when\nneeded but somehow managed\nto lose the essence of ' Time Was'. The menacing moments\nof this crowd warmer were\ncertainly there, but the\ndelicacy was done sacr if ici ed to a rough rock ' n' roll treat-ment.\nThe rest of the evening was\na different story. The more\nearthy and simplistic approach\nthe band now take to their\nmusic certainly adds fire and\nexcitement, although I remained\nunimpressed with the new\nnumbers in the set (from the\n'New England' LP due for\nrelease soon). The first song\nI managed to recognise was\n'The King Will Come' from the\nArgus album, Here the heavier,\nmore involved guitar work has\nreinforced the introduction,\nwhilst more collaboration\nwithin the band on vocals has\nproduced a harsh, gutsy,\nsound that somehow remains\npenetrating and strangely\nmelodic.\nA torr rent of guitar riffs\nfrom the bands guitarists\nintroduced 'The Warrior',\nanother crowd-please r. The\ntrack does have some tender\nvocal work, and Martin Turner\nHalls, Croydon (October 31st) proved more than adequate\ntreatment here.\nIt was not until half-way\nthrough a new number 'Laura\nLive', when I was becoming\ndisinterest in their new work,\nthat I realised how well\ndrummer Steve Upton had been\nplaying. Trouble was he'd been\nso on top of the songs from\nthe start, that I'd almost\nforgotten him!\n'Persephone' from the\nThere's the Pub LP was\nAndy Powell's first chance of\nthe evening to excel. Andy\nand Laurie play musical\njesting, each one vi eing for\na better guitar riff. In this\nsong Andy had the better\nthemes, managing to straddle\nthe song well with a mixture\nof interwoven guitar licks and\nbland up front guitar Work.\nLaurie, in a thick ' pin stripe dem in' trouser and\nwaistcoat combination is\nequally talented as he showed\non 'The King Will Come' and\n'It Started In Heaven, But\nFinished With Rock 'n' Roll'.\nDespite the r'n' r nature of\nthe latter, it does possess\nenough variation to let Laurie\nput the band's indelible stamp\non it. As its sounds bounced\naround the hall, adding an\nenthralling echo to the band,\nthe mirror ball started spinning\nat it looked like the end of the\nevening.\nNot so; 'Time Was' was followed by a dazzling version of\nthe ever-popular 'Blowing\nFree'. And then came the\nencores as the crowd spawned\naround their heroes, and\nMartin Turner started to\nundress between numbers.\nJust think, another encore and\nhe'd have been down to his pants!\nClive Dewey\nVc * 0 LK \u00b0io.\nnD CO CM TCM PRESENTS\nBOB PEGG\nIN THE\nUNION LOWER\nREFECTORY\n8pm Wed. 17th Nov\nALL(especially singers)WELCOME\nNational's actors nearly\nconquer trivia\n'II Campiello' by Carlo Goldoni\nIn presenting '// Campiello'\nthe enormously talented, and\nheavily sub sidi sed, National\nTheatre have attempted to\nmake entertainment from what\ncan only be described as\nTrivia. They almost succeed. Venetian-born Goldoni wrote\nmore than 200 plays, most of\nthem between about 1750 and\n1770, and if ' / / ' Campiello'\nis a typical example, it is\neasy to understand why his\nwork is almost never performed\nnowadays. Although in his\ntime he was responsible for\ntransforming the Italian theatre\nby changing the Commedia\ndell'are from improvisation to\nwritten plays, his writing is\nnow so far removed from us\nin space, time and culture,\nthat '// Campiello' is of little\nmore than passing historical\ninterest to a modern audience.\nVery little actually happens\nin the Vetetian square of the\ntitle: lovers quarrel but soon\nkiss and make up, neighbours\nargue but eventually apologise\nand wicked guardians relent.\nThere is a magnificent\nopening to the play, with cast,\nmusicians and sundries converging towards the stage\nfrom all corners of the auditor-(Olivier Theatre)\ni um, complete with gigantic\npuppets and live animals. Beryl Reid and Peggy Mount\ndo much to raise the production\n(Miss Reid' s frequent 'ad-lib b ing' was one of the best\naspects of the evening) and I also enjoyed Stephen Rea's wi Id Irish pedlar.\nChoreography and costumes\nmust also be mentioned, since\nthey contributed well to the\nItalian carnival atmosphere:\nthere, was a gay natural\nabandonment about the scenes\nin which anything actually\nhappens.\nUnfortunately it's all. a bit like the music of Wagner:\nthere are some beautiful\nmoments, but dreadful quarter-hours. The dialogue is general ly\nuninspired and rather boring\n(except when the translator\npermits one or two AngloSaxon phrases), and the ending\nof the play was sentimental to\nthe point of embarrassment.\nI think the director intended\n(as did Goldoni) to present a realistic portrait of the Italian\nworking class, but with such\npoor material the result is\nhollow and inconsequential.\nSteve Grove\n(LACK LABEL\nTHANKSJOY\n\n"
