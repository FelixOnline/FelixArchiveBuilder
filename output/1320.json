    "content": "THEATRE\nOh Kevin Spacey. So many critics are\ndisappointed in you. You swoop over\nfrom the United States, buy yourself\na theatre, pick out a few plays and\nstar in all of them. Can you see how\nthat might look a bit pretentious?\nNot to mention that when any actor\nmakes a move as bold as that, the\ntheatre community doesn\u2019t need justification when they sit back, cross\ntheir arms and say, \u201cRight, let\u2019s see\nhow he\u2019s going to pull this off.\u201d\nNational Anthems is set in the\n1980s in a Detroit suburb. Arthur\nReed, played by Steven Weber, and\nhis wife Leslie, played by Mary\nStuart Masterson, are greeted by an\noffish neighbour Ben Cook, played by\nSpacey, as he waltzes in one evening\nand introduces himself. The evening\nto follow is full of absurdity, hilarity,\nand fraught with emotion.\nI want you to take a deep breath\nbefore this bit of information: Kevin\nSpacey has played this role before,\nin 1988 when the play was called\nThe Party Crasher. I found that a\nbit disconcerting. Let us go back\nto the beginning scenario. Spacey\nsaunters to London, purchases the\nOld Vic, picks a few plays and stars\nin all of them \u2013 but one of the first\nplays he chooses is something he\u2019s\nalready done before?\nBravo, Spacey, way to be original.\nThe theatre community is smug and\nawaiting your next move, now you\nreally have to prove yourself.\nStuart Masterson\u2019s experience as\na screen actor was present on stage.\nShe made too much of an effort to\nactually act. But as the performance went on, she relaxed into her\nrole and I became more willing to\nbelieve her.\nSpacey and Weber complimented\neach other wonderfully; they carried\nthe performance as if it were a delicate feather for all to see. Spacey\u2019s\nacting skills are not on the line here.\nHe is a very talented man, but with\nthat talent, he has a lot to live up to.\nTo get the credit he deserves, he\nneeds to work a little harder.\nAll bitterness aside, the play was\ndecent. The script was well written\nand the actors delivered a proper\nperformance. I do think that Spacey\nshould have chosen a different play.\nIf this play was in any other theatre,\nwith actors of any other name, it\nwould have been seen as a remarkable and delightful. But with all the\nhype that Spacey has been given,\nthis wasn\u2019t anything more than a\npleasant evening out.\nPerhaps I\u2019m not a fan of modern\ntheatre. Like modern art for some,\nit can be hard to appreciate because\nthe issues beingg dealt with are\nissues that we confront every day.\nEven though the issues are impor-tant, it can sometimes be numb-ing, and hearing them expressed in\nseveral different formats can either\nmake you more passionate about a\ncertain issue or wish the contemporary artist would quit whining.\nWild East at the Royal Court is\nset in a job interview. A delightfully awkward candidate, Frank, is\nbeing interviewed by two women.\nThe interview starts uncomfortably\nand gives the audience a good laugh.\nThen strange things begin to happen\nand, as time passes, the interview\nworsens and any sane human being\nwould have found the door and never\nlooked back. However, for the sake of\nentertaining and passing a message\nalong to the audience, the interview\ngoes on, and on, and on.\nTom Brooke, playing Frank, does\na good job of giving the audience\nthe best view into the world of an\nestranged nerd that wants more than\nanything to catch his lucky break.\nThe two women, actresses Sylvestra\nLe Touzel and Helen Schlesinger,\ncompliment each other nicely, but it\nwas difficult to really figure either of\nthem out.\nWild East is a play about corporate\nmongers and the awful work they\ndo, about masks, personas, and how\nour jobs and the success of a measly\ninterview can give us our soul or\ntake it away.\nAs I mentioned before, I don\u2019t\nthink I have the capacity to truly\nunderstand and appreciate modern theatre that addresses present\nissues. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because I\ndon\u2019t want to, I think it\u2019s because I\u2019m\nstill developing my craft as a theatre\ncritic. It\u2019s easier to talk about issues\nfrom the past because they have\nbeen addressed and analysed many\ntimes over. But since I don\u2019t fully\nunderstand how I feel about issues\nat hand, modern plays that comment on these issues feel more like\npropaganda than a different way to\nlook at the world around us.\nNational Anthems\nOld Vic\nThe Cut, SE1\nBox Office: 0870 060 6628\nwww.oldvictheatre.com\nArts arts.felix@ic.ac.uk\nModern theatre and Hollywood\nTatum Fjerstad is unmoved by Kevin Spacey\nThe summer term is always a night-mare. Between revision, exams,\nprojects and hayfever, it\u2019s a wonder\nwe don\u2019t all end up in a variety of\ninstitutions by the end of term. Or\nperhaps it\u2019s just me my own terrible\nhayfever and nervous disposition.\nEither way, a method of relaxation is\nalways vital to retaining some form\nof sanity, and as we all can expect,\nI am going to suggest some cultural\nways to relax.\nStaying with the theatre theme,\nas both of the productions reviewed\nabove have just closed, let me suggest both establishments\u2019 new pro-ductions.\nForthoseofyouenjoyingnewplays,\nthe Royal Court Theatre is definitely\nthe place to go. Opening on 7 May\nis David Eldridge\u2019s Incomplete and\nRandom Acts of Kindness, directed\nby Sean Holmes. The Old Vic, on the\nother hand, will be going for a classic\npiece, the 1939 hit by Philip Barry,\nThe Philadelphia Story. Perhaps\nbest known in its film version starring Katherine Hepburn, this run will\nstar Jennifer Ehle (Miss Elizabeth\nBennet in everyone\u2019s favourite BBC\nadaptation of Pride and Prejudice)\nas the society girl Tracy Lord. Of\ncourse we will also have another\nchance to see the ever-present Mr\nSpacey, however I\u2019d go see it just\none the strength of casting Ehle as\nLord. Both theatres have good ticket\noffers, so don\u2019t let cost put you off,\nand visit their websites for details.\nOne service that should not be\nignored by those of you seeking\ncheap theatre or musical tickets is\nthe \u2018tkts\u2019 booth in Leicester Square\n(just like the ones in New York). Half\nprice tickets are available to buy on\nthe day of performance from 10am\nto 7pm. Their website is www.tkts.\nco.uk.\nThe Caravaggio exhibition at the\nNational Gallery runs until 22 May.\nHaving just been to see it, I cannot\nrecommend it enough. This exhibition is a worthy successor to the\ngallery\u2019s recent Titian and El Greco\nexhibition.\nThe art showcased in here is representative of Michelangelo Merisi\nda Caravaggio\u2019s (1571 \u2013 1610) final\nyears. Something of a firebrand,\nCaravaggio died before reaching 40\nand spent the last four years of his\nlife on the run from justice for a\nmurder in Rome. The 16 works in\nthe exhibition are primarily on biblical themes, as is typical for the\nperiod, all reflecting the artist\u2019s fear\nof divine justice for his crime. The\nchange in the artist\u2019s mood is clearly\npointed out in the exhibition\u2019s first\nroom, as both of his interpretations\nof the Supper at Emmaus are available for scrutiny; with one painted in\n1601 and the other in 1606, the darkening of the mood and more contemplative style are instantly visible.\nAll of the works are beautifully\nexecuted with composition and\nlighting being used to their utmost.\nThe Flagellation (1607), The\nRaising of Lazarus (1608-9), The\nMartyrdom of Saint Ursula (1610),\nand The Annunciation (1608-9) are,\nin my opinion, the highlights of the\nshow. Tickets can only be bought\non the day from the box office in\nthe Sainsbury wing of the gallery\non Trafalgar Square. They\u2019re \u00a33 for\nstudents, and during the final week\nthe exhibition will be open late every\nday.\nIf live music is more appealing\nto you, I cannot remind you often\nenough to keep watch for the London\nPhilharmonic\u2019s special student\noffers (www.lpo.org.uk). Also worth\nremembering is that the Proms will\nsoon be upon us at the Albert Hall.\nThe Royal Opera House has now\nopened public booking for its latest\nproductions, as well as unveiling\nnext season\u2019s programme. Possibly\nfollowing criticism received for this\nyear\u2019s rather \u2018greatest hits\u2019 laden\nprogramme, the Royal Opera will be\nperforming numerous less famous\nworks in the new season.\nOne last recommendation would\nbe Orph\u00e9e in the Royal Opera\nHouse\u2019s smaller performance space,\nthe Linbury Theatre. The chamber\nopera by Philip Glass will put young-er, rising artists in leading roles and\nruns from 7 May to 5 June. Tickets\nare \u00a315 for students (www.roh.org.\nuk).

Those\nthings you disclose, those things you\nhide from others \u2013 secrets are the\nvery reason other people are inquis-itive. Good things, let me tell you.\nWelcome to a final term of decadence and debauchery, in which\nI, Stormy Woods, aspire to usurp\nthe dizzying heights I\u2019ve previously\nreached in my quest to enjoy life to\nthe max.\nFinal term, eh? Isn\u2019t that when\nyou\u2019re supposed to be on a caffeinated diet in 24-hour library conditions\nwhilst attempting to get that vital\n2.1 passport to Merrill Lynch and\nsimilarly prestigious wanker banker\nfirms? Sadly not, dear readers, for I\nam a fourth year of the witchdoctory\nfaculty, in my BSc year, cruising\nthrough my final term of freedom\nbefore wards, exemplary behaviour\nand trying to flirt my way through\nplacements become things of the\npresent for me.\nSo what will this term bring to the\neternally pervy Stormy? Perhaps\nI\u2019ll get to enjoy some exotic males\nfrom far flung countries, the Latinoheat kinda thing? I might even get\nto emulate this Spring\u2019s couture\nwith an African tribal-inspired con-sort. My friend and I know that\nthose international students have\nan impressive array of bedroom\ncustoms we\u2019re yet to experience\nin the sack. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that they shall impress\n\u2013 the Kama Sutra didn\u2019t originate in\nEngland!\nRacist stereotypes aside \u2013 stereotypes of which I myself have been\nthe unfortunate victim when a chap\nasked me to be more subservient,\nsince that\u2019s what Asian girls did\n(needless to say, he ended up in\nA&E with testicular torsion) \u2013 I\u2019ve\nnot been especially inspired with\nregards to matters of the pants.\nThere have been a couple of interlopers \u2013 one of whom was hideous to\nthe point where he had to be kissed\nwith the lights off at night, and the\nother so attractive I practically\ncame on looking at him. The Stormy\nparadox has been set: the uglier the\nguy, the better he is in bed.\nUgly guy was courteous, consider-ate, willing to learn and, most impor-tantly, willing to compromise and\ntry new things. The handsome chap\nwas selfish, unadventurous, pat-ronising, hurtful and presumptious,\nassuming I\u2019d like everything that\nthe last six million girls he\u2019d been to\nbed with liked. Each and every man\nand woman is different, and I cannot\nstress exactly how considerate it is\nto ask your bed partners how you\u2019re\ndoing and whether there\u2019s anything\nthey\u2019d like you to do. Satisfied people are often happy people \u2013 and if\nit wasn\u2019t for ugly guy\u2019s inability to\neat with his mouth closed and the\nrest of his hygenically-challenged\nlifestyle, Stormy Woods would have\na boyfriend.\nCaveats are always interesting,\naren\u2019t they? How would... what if...\nif he didn\u2019t... life would be different,\nI guess, and so would I. If I didn\u2019t\nmeet the Shreddie at Retribution, I\nmight not have developed the neverending white rasta-look obsession. If\nI didn\u2019t stalk the very same Shreddie\nat college, I\u2019d never have come\nacross and had the time of my life\nwith ugly guy. These things are cir-cumrotary. I could be married with\nchildren in Bangladesh by now.\nBut I\u2019m not. And I\u2019m bloody grateful for not having to do a Jemima\nKhan and miss out on a glittering social life in my prime whilst\nattempting to find myself amongst\nthe luxury mansions in Lahore.\nJemima looks so dated. I wish she\u2019d\nuse her considerable fortune to buy\nherself a wardrobe befitting of a\nprincess; she\u2019s got a lovely figure,\nand stunning features, which seem\nto be swamped by her ridiculous\nAslan-type mane.\nI also reckon a few women above\ntheir stations at College need\nStormy makeovers too, starting\nwith a female union worker regularly ridiculed for her permanently\nmiserable face complete with oversized hair. Eww, don\u2019t make me\nsick. Pervy thoughts, think pervy\nthoughts. Nathan Constance. Yum.\nAnd yum is where I\u2019ll end this\nentry. Yum-lick man. The human\npug, as he\u2019s more affectionately\nknown by women who can\u2019t help\nbut fancy him thanks to his scrawny figure and defenceless puppy-dog eyes. Inspiration to ugly guys\neverywhere, yum-lick man has\nproved you don\u2019t need looks or a\nstunning personality to get the goth\nscene\u2019s version of Carmen Electra\nworshipping at your bruised feet.\nYou just need a fetish that both\nyourself and your object of affection\nclick with.\nIn his case, it\u2019s slavery \u2013 he does\nwhat she says, and enjoys it \u2013 in\nboth the carnal and real life form.\nShe (about whom I shall not reveal\nany more details) loves the control\nshe experiences on telling him to\nkneel before her as she is his mas-ter. Riveting stuff for those aware of\nthese relationship dynamics, let me\ntell you. I\u2019m not actually supposed\nto know what\u2019s going on, but voyeurism is so much more fun when you\nknow everybody\u2019s little secret.\nThe girl about town\nby STORMY WOODS\nWell, analysing Imperial and not\nmentioning the nerd community\nwould be a glaring omission (like not\nconnecting Einstein with E=mc2\n).\nSo, this week, I will try to focus on\nthe following topics:\n1. What is a nerd?\n2. What kind of nerds are there?\n3. How do you know you\u2019re a nerd?\n4. You\u2019re a nerd. Now what?\n1. What is a nerd?\n\u2018Nerd\u2019 probably comes from the\nLatin word \u2018nerdus\u2019 \u2013 one who, when\nhe dies and looks back on his life,\nsees nothing. But there are more\nthings beyond this simple word.\nThere\u2019s a whole universe to explore:\na geeky underworld.\nWe all know how they look (glasses\nlike Dexter\u2019s, pen in their unwashed\n1970s shirt pocket, laptop/PDA suitcase under their left arm, 848 books\nunder their right arm, pictures of\ntheir favourite lecturer\u2019s sons in\ntheir wallets), so I won\u2019t waste your\ntime with that.\nIf you have no clue about their\nappearence, just stop reading this\narticle (if you have a sad enough life\nto be wasting it with lousy columns),\nraise your head and look around.\nYou see? Wherever you might be\n(Junior Common Room, Main\nDinning Hall, the computer room in\nyour department or a picnic towel\nin Hyde Park) you are surrounded\nby them. Yes, all those strange eyes\nlooking at you like they disapprove\nof your laid back attitude are those\nof N-E-R-D-S.\nUnfortunately, as you noticed, they\nare not extinct, even after all the\nhard work of anti-nerd movements.\nThey are stronger than cockroaches\n(and believe me, cockroaches have\nsurvived major natural catastrophes \u2013 from the dinosaurs\u2019 extintion\nto the re-election of George W Bush)\nand are hard to exterminate.\n2. What kinds of nerds are\nthere?\n\u2022 Front row nerd \u2013 sits in the front\nrow and smiles at the lecturer while\ntaking notes with five different coloured pens of every-bloody-thing he\nsays in a perfectly organized note-book. Always arrives 15 minutes\nearly for optimal viewing position in\nthe lecture theatre.\n\u2022 Arse-licking nerd \u2013 an evolution of the front row nerd. Has the\nimproved ability to melt even the\ncoldest lecturer\u2019s heart with sym-pathy, offers to help him with his\nresearch (even if that means losing\nthree hours of study a day) and\nmakes geeky jokes about physics\nand maths. Always tries to approach\nthe teacher when the lecture fin-ishes, even if that means grabbing\nsomeone by the neck.\n\u2022 Rebel nerd \u2013 a nerd trying to get\na more normal life (and by that I\nmean going out of his room to buy\nsome bread or, eventually, waste his\ntime with music). Sometimes, tries\nto do something outrageous and\nonly hands in the coursework five\ndays before the deadline or drinks\ncoke without taking all the gas bubbles off.\n\u2022 Nerd wannabe \u2013 a bad student\nthat wants to raise his Third to a 2.2\ndegree and so starts imitating front\nrow or arse-licking nerds. Lacks\nquality and years of experience,\nthough.\n\u2022 Nerd converter \u2013 wants to bring\neven more people to his religion\n(geekianism) by: a) inviting them to\njoin his workgroups, b) letting them\ncopy a third of his homework, c)\nnot ordering all the books from the\nlibrary (unless he\u2019s desperate).\n\u2022 Nerd leader \u2013 he talks, they follow.\nHe\u2019s THE NERD. Like male lions\nand red iguanas, there can only be\none in each classroom. He leads all\nthe other nerds through their boring\nuniversity lives.\n\u2022 LAN parties nerd \u2013 this is a different breed - most of them are bad\nstudents! You cannot separate LAN\nnerd from his most loved treasure:\nhis laptop. Usually spends Friday\nand Saturday nights (or even the\nwhole week) playing LAN games\nwith his fellow nerds.\n3. How do you know you\u2019re a\nnerd?\nIf you\u2019re reading this article, you are\neither:\na) an Imperial College student\nb) an Imperial College lecturer not\ncaring about his research\nc) an Imperial College student\u2019s or\nlecturer\u2019s friend\nd) an Imperial College student or\nlecturer\u2019s parent.\nSo... I\u2019m sorry to inform you, but\nyou are probably a nerd! And in case\n(d), it\u2019s your genes\u2019 fault!\nDon\u2019t you agree? Well, think about\nyour life and if you answer YES to\nany of the following questions, jump\nimmediately to part 4.\n\u2022 Have you ever had a LAN party?\n\u2022 Have you ever spent a Friday or\nSaturday night studying?\n\u2022 Do you study for more than 45\nminutes a day?\n\u2022 Do you not give a crap about what\nyou\u2019re wearing?\n\u2022 Do you have names for your computer or calculator?\n\u2022 Did you break up with your last\ngirlfriend because \u201cI can\u2019t have a\ngirlfriend and do this course at the\nsame time\u201d?\n\u2022 Do you only see your friends when\nyou go to the computer room?\n\u2022 Have you ever had more than\none meal at the college in the same\nday?\n\u2022 Did you go to Dixon\u2019s or any other\nhi-tech shop the last time you left\nyour room?\n\u2022 Have you never watched a football\ngame or a teen movie?\n\u2022 Have you never got slightly tipsy?\n\u2022 Is your favourite pet called Frodo\nor Heisenberg?\n\u2022 Do you have trouble tying your\nshoe laces?\n4. You\u2019re a nerd. Now what?\nMake the world a better place and\nplease stop spreading your genes!\nAnalyse them\nby DIOGO GERALDES\n\n"

Yes, this\nmeant spending nine bloody\nhours on the M6 in a cramped\nminibus negotiating with\nother Londoners who had the\nsame idea.\nWas it worth it? Well, on\narrival at our camping barn\nwe unlocked the doors to find\nnothing other than two drunken Geordies stinking up the\nplace with incessant belching and foul language. In a\ndesperate bid to take back\nour barn, we tried to strike\na compromise in which they\ncould sleep downstairs if they\njust let us get our stuff out and\nget to sleep.\nCome the morning, howev-er, the two were friendly and\nbright, offering to help us put\nup some more tents before\nthey set off on their way.\nThis, of course, is a lie, seeing\nas the two were still completely drunk and rather\nincoherent. Feeling little\nsympathy for them, our ever-courteous president decided\nto outwit them using complicated words and not starting\nevery sentence with a four-letter profanity in a desperate\nbid to get rid of them (even-tually the local farmer \u2018took\ncare\u2019 of them, in case you\nwere wondering).\nAfter that incident, we set\noff in search of the tallest hills\nto climb and the best scenery the Lake District has to\noffer. While one group tested\ntheir skills with the ice axes\non Striding Edge, the other\ngroup walked for a good solid\neight hours up three different mountains! Although we\nhad to fight off the occasional\nblizzard on the summit and\nthe biting wind, the views\nwere incredible and literally\nleft you breathless (although\nthat could have been the bitter cold).\nEventually, el presidente\n(Sarah) managed to get us all\nrounded up like so many zombie sheep, into the minibus\nand back to the barn, where\n\u2018Trial by Gas Stove\u2019 began.\nFor the uninitiated amongst\nyou, this is an ancient mythical ritual whose origins are\nlong forgotten (too many\nbar nights I suppose).

    "content": "18 www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 April 2005\nEinstein was right. God\ndoesn\u2019t play dice with the\nuniverse. Perhaps he plays\npoker.\nOur universe is governed by\nlaws of chance. Sub-atomic\nparticles, the very stuff of real-ity, can only be measured in\nterms of probabilities. Albert\nEinstein famously found this\nidea hard to accept. He could\nnot bring himself to accept\nthat events such as spontaneous radioactive decays were\ntruly random. He believed\nthat \u201cGod does not play dice\nwith the universe\u201d; his metaphysical conviction was that\nthere were certain hidden\nvariables at play.\nIf God doesn\u2019t play dice with\nthe universe then surely he\nplays poker, where there is an\nelement of designandchance.\nIt is against this cultural back-drop, perhaps, that poker has\ngone from being a fad in this\ncountry to something resembling an organised religion.\nAnd if you were there at last\nmonth\u2019s UK Student Poker\nChampionship, you would be\nforgiven for conflating poker\nwith religion.\nThe inaugural championship was highly organised\nand involved 259 students\nfrom around 35 different university poker societies. The\ngame was No Limit Texas\nHold \u2018Em, as featured on TV\nseries such as Channel 4\u2019s\nLate Night Poker. Tickets\nto the event were worth \u00a330\neach, making a total prize\npool of \u00a37,770.\nThe organisers, St Andrews\nUniversity Poker Society\nand Betfred (who are soon\nto launch an online poker\nwebsite) claimed that this\nwas the biggest ever tournament poker event in the UK.\nRumour had it that it was the\nbiggest ever in Europe.\nIt wasn\u2019t hard to see why,\nespecially with the top prize\nbeing a prestigious $10,000\nseat at the World Series of\nPoker in Las Vegas, where\nthere will be $50m of prize\nmoney at stake.\nA team from Imperial\u2019s\nPoker Society travelled up\nto St Andrews in Scotland to\ntake part in the event. Adam\nLatimer, Saurabh Pandya,\nRobert Glasspool, Karan\nLohia and Felix science editor Darius Nikbin had qualified via an Imperial satellite\ntournament.\nThe first day was a ten hour\nmarathon, during which the\n260 players were reduced to\n30. These 30 would go on to\nplay for a place at the final\ntable on the second day. Two\nout of the five Imperial play-ers, Robert and Darius, made\nit to day two \u2013 in itself an\nexcellent result.\nEventually, after an gruelling two days of playing poker,\nRob finished in a superb 20th\nposition. Darius fought his\nway through to the final table,\nwhere he finished the tournament in third place overall.\nTo the delight of the home\nfans, the eventual winner\nwas Calum MacNicol of St\nAndrews University.\nThird and 20th places were\nexcellent results for Imperial\nPokerSoc, and with more tournaments this term and next\nyear, it looks like tournament\npoker at Imperial is going\nfrom strength to strength.\nFor more information about\npoker at Imperial, visit the\npoker society\u2019s website, www.\nicups.co.uk.\nPOKER SOCIETY\nImperial \u2018take it down\u2019 at UK student\npoker championship\nPoker faces: action from the early stages of the UK student poker championship, in which\nImperial\u2019s Darius Nikbin claimed third place out of 259 competitors\nCLUBS & SOCIETIES felix@ic.ac.uk\nFancy shifting those\nextra pounds?\nThen Join IC Fitness\nClub!\nWe offer fun classes with\nprofessional instructors in\naerobics, Pilates, Tae Bo,\nyoga and more\nVenue: Southside gym or Union gym\nCheap membership and classes\nClasses from \u00a31.50\nVisit our website for details & class timetable at\nhttp://www.union.ic.ac.uk/rcc/fitness\nSub-Warden Position at Beit Hall\nA sub-warden position will be available from September 2005 in Beit Hall.

    "content": "W\ne, the people of the United Kingdom,\ndeserve better. The Conservatives\nhave made clear promises to make\nour lives better. How is it that more taxes\nare required to provide the same, sometimes\nless, service that has previously been made\navailable?\nCivil service bureaucracy is wasting our\nlimited resources. Michael Howard has identified \u00a312bn over the next two to three years\nin duplicated and wasted paper-pushing that\ncan be reinvested into our tired public serv-ices.\nThe chief culprits of overspent pen-push-ing are in the NHS and the police force. It\nis surely common sense that there should\nbe more doctors and nurses than adminis-trators. Hospitals are places for the sick to\nrecover and should be run by doctors and\nnurses, with doctors and nurses for the better\ntreatment and recovery of patients. The less\ntime a doctor has to spend filling in forms, the\nmore time is available for treating the ill. With\nfewer forms, fewer admin staff are required\nand in turn fewer managers, all of which frees\nwasted cash which can be redistributed to\nfront line services.\nLabour has said that more police have\nbeen recruited. This is true, but rather than\npounding their beat, they are filling in pieces\nof paper to satisfy the Home Office. For\nexample, there is a form that a police officer\nhas to fill in for trivial matters such as stopping and questioning someone in the street.\nEven if this mass of paper is required, the\nwork can be done by civilians, which will\nfree up the trained personnel to help protect\nthe citizens. Yobs need to be brought under\ncontrol. Too often, the victim of a crime is the\none punished.\nIn both the cases highlighted, public services should be about serving the public \u2013 not\nproviding needless jobs to help bring down\ngovernment unemployment statistics.\nEven if you do not believe in his politics, you\nshould believe in the man that is Mr Howard.\nThe Conservative manifesto is short and to\nthe point, with every single pound in the GDP\naccounted for. What you see is what you get.\nThere are no economies with the truth, unlike\nthe Labour premier, Tony Blair, who says one\nthing and does another.\nTop-up fees are a prime example. It was\nstated that Labour would not introduce them,\nyet latest reports show that they are currently increasing to \u00a33000 a year and will be\nincreased further in the next parliament.\nWhy should a medical or engineering student\nbe charged \u00a33000 per year tuition fees and\nthen be in the higher income tax bracket?\nThis person is providing a service to the pub-lic, helping to save and make better the lives\nof those around. Education should be free to\nthose who want it. By scrapping the ridiculous 50% student target, money can be saved\nby removing virtually worthless degrees.\nMr Blair is not the only problem, however.\nGordon Brown has stolen money from pension funds. My parents should have retired\nyears ago, but thanks to the depleted pension funds this is not possible. The dream\nthat so many couples had of a well-funded\nretirement is no longer possible. Some find\nit hard enough to scrape together enough for\nbasic sustenance, all because of the greed of\nNumber 11.\nWith state pensions in disarray, hard working families switched to paying into a private\npension fund. The latest from the Chancellor:\nhe plans to raid the private pension funds in\nthe next budget. How long can this disgraceful behaviour be allowed to continue? If an\nold aged pensioner withdrew their lifesav-ings and was mugged in the street, wouldn\u2019t\nsociety demand vengeance? The final nail in\nthe coffin is that with what little money is left,\npensioners must then pay council tax which\nhas risen by an average of 78%.\nWe need to put trust in the people, not\nthe civil servants. How can pen-pushing\nEuropeans decide the future of our country?\nWith self-determination, we can preserve\nour history, culture and heritage. We are\nBritish, not European. The same goes for\nWestminster too. Wales, Northern Ireland\nand Scotland need control over their own\nlaws and councils, but without the costly\nexpense of the Holyrood fiasco. Money should\nbe available for councils to spend as to their\nrequirements; schools in one area will require\na different amount of funding and different\nstyle of teaching to another.\nYou have a voice. You can make it count.\nVote for a change. Vote Conservative.\nWhy you should vote... CONSERVATIVE\nBy Chris Hampsheir (Chair Elect, Imperial College Conservative Future)\n\u201cT\nhe Government\u2019s support for\nresearch is declining, falling further behind that of our main industrial competitors in Europe whose policy is\nto increase investment in scientific research.\nThere is no excuse\u201d.\nThis was the 1986 plea by a group of university scientists, bought together around a common concern that the then Tory government\nwas slashing British science budgets, making\nit increasingly difficult to fund world-class\nresearch. The response amongst academics\nto their half page advert in The Times was\noverwhelming and within a year the campaign \u2018Save British Science\u2019 was founded.\nToday, the picture is very different. In\nMarch, Tony Blair visited Imperial College\nto announce plans for an extra investment of\n\u00a310bn into British science research, continuing a commitment to sciences and engineering that has run throughout the last eight\nyears of Labour Government, based on a\nbelief that vibrant research is key to our continued prosperity.\nIn his budget, Gordon Brown re-affirmed\nthis commitment with a pledge to continue\nincreasing the share of GDP invested in sci-ence, raising us even further above the 1997\nlevels after 18 years of Tory cuts. Meanwhile,\nin the thinnest manifesto by a major political\nparty in recent times, at a scrawny 28 pages,\nthe Tories fail to even mention the word \u2018science\u2019, let alone set out a plan for funding and\nencouraging world-class research.\nPerhaps it\u2019s fortunate that the Tory\u2019s skeletal manifesto isn\u2019t longer. The 28 pages\nare terrifying enough: a return to the dodgy\neconomics of promising to lower taxes and\nborrow less, yet simultaneously vowing to\nincrease spending. Are you thinking what I\u2019m\nthinking? It just doesn\u2019t add up: you can\u2019t use\nthe same money twice to increase spending\nand cut taxes. They tried it before, and we got\neconomic boom and bust as a result.\nIt might seem odd that as one of the many\nmembers of the student movement who\nfought against top-up fees, I\u2019m urging you to\nvote Labour. It might even seem appealing\nto give the Government a kick in the teeth by\nvoting Liberal Democrat, but the truth is that\nit is a choice between a Labour government\nand a Tory government. A choice between a\ngovernment that is increasing public spending on higher education by over a third, or\na party that wants to slash university places\nby sending over 100,000 students home and\ncharging commercial interest rates on student loans.\nVoting Liberal Democrat only makes it easier for Michael Howard to walk into Downing\nStreet as we wake up on 6 May. The Liberal\nDemocrats make much of their claim to have\nabolished tuition fees in Scotland, but it\u2019s not\nthe full story. Up-front fees were replaced\nwith a deferred graduate payment, a system\nthat was condemned by student leaders as a\nbetrayal of their pledge to abolish all forms of\npayment. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 university\nfunding plans would deny many the chance\nto study at Imperial College: to save costs\nthey have said that they want students to\nstay at home and study locally. In abolishing\ncouncil tax, they would also abolish the student exemption, hitting students who work\nhard to fund their degree with their new local\nincome tax.\nSome lucky voters were recently targeted\nwith a direct mail from the Tories outlining\ntheir \u2018plan for action\u2019 should they be elected.\nIt\u2019s not so much a plan to tackle the big\nissues facing Britain today, rather a plan to\ndismantle the positive changes that Labour\nhas introduced since 1997. The Tories have\na record on this: whenever Labour has held\noffice they have set up a Department for\nInternational Development with a clear mission to tackle poverty, only for it to be ditched\nby an incoming Tory administration.\nHillary Benn, Secretary of State for\nInternational Development, speaking at\nImperial College in February, described how\naid has more than doubled since 1997 and\nnow, having cancelled the debt of the poorest\ncountries, Britain is urging others to follow\nour lead and offer 100% debt relief. Thanks\nto British leadership in the G8, the scandal of\nglobal poverty cannot be ignored by affluent\nnations. Similarly, Labour leadership in the\ninternational community has led to action on\nclimate change. The UK has already met its\nKyoto obligations and was pivotal in persuading Russia to ratify it.\nThe Tories are fighting a negative campaign and show more interest in spreading\nfear than presenting a positive vision for the\nfuture. When setting out the choice facing you\non 5 May, Sir Alex Ferguson puts it well:\n\u201cThis Labour government has led this\ncountry into a period of unparalleled pros-perity. Britain is a fairer, more prosperous,\ntolerant and caring country that it ever was\nunder the Tories.\u201d\nWhy you should vote... LABOUR\nBy Alex Guite (Chair, Imperial College Union Labour Society)\nY\nOU MAY THINK of the Liberal\nDemocrats as still the third party in the\nUK, but did you know that among stu-dents, the latest poll figures show Lib Dem\nsupport standing at 47%, higher than Labour\nand the Conservatives combined?\nMembership of Lib Dem Youth and Students\n(LDYS) is rising at its fastest rate for as long\nas we can remember, and the number of our\nuniversity and college branches has doubled\nsince the Iraq War. So why are so many students turning to the Lib Dems?\nFrom what people tell us, it\u2019s because\nwe\u2019re honest, open and consistent. We\u2019ve\nopposed Labour\u2019s tuition fees and top-up\nfees from the start, and have openly shown\nwhere the money will come from to remove\nthem (a higher rate of tax on earnings over\n\u00a3100,000). We\u2019ve already removed the fees\nfrom Scottish universities, through applying\npressure in our coalition government with\nLabour.\nWe opposed the Iraq War from the start,\nunlike other parties who just criticised it\nwhen they saw how unpopular it was. We\nwere the first major political party to call\nfor the legalisation of cannabis and for drug\naddiction to be treated as a health issue, not\nan issue for the criminal law. We\u2019ve been\nfighting for action on world trade injustice\nand environmental destruction for years.\nBut behind our policies, often eventually \u2018copied\u2019 by other parties, is something\nunique. We\u2019re the only party that allows all\nits members to have a genuine say in what\ngoes on. Any party member can write a\npolicy and have it debated at LDYS or the\nmain party conference, where everyone gets\nto vote on it. If it gets passed, it becomes\nnational party policy! No other party puts this\namount of power and influence in the hands\nof its members.\nWe have a belief in liberalism, a belief\nthat everyone should be ensured the same\nopportunities in life regardless of their\nbackground, that people should be trusted\nand encouraged to run their own lives, provided what they do does not harm others.\nBecause of this, we also want to see the way\npeople vote in this country changed to proportional representation, so every vote will\nhave an impact on the outcome. For us, a\ndemocracy should truly represent the views\nof all its voters, not just the wealthiest or the\nmost vocal.\nSo what does the rise in Lib Dem support\namongst students and across the country\nmean at this election?\nWell, there are 14 Labour and 13\nConservative seats around the country\nwhere the number of students exceeds the\ngap between the sitting MP and the Liberal\nDemocrat candidate.\nIn Norwich, Charles Clarke, the former\nEducation Secretary responsible for pushing\ntop-up fees through parliament and current\nHome Secretary responsible for the terror\nbill and ID cards could lose his seat. There is\na majority of 9,727 over the Liberal Democrats\nand a student population of 9,000.\nWe Liberal Democrats will be campaigning for every vote in every constituency. We\nwant a fairer, safer, greener Britain that acts\nresponsibly on the international stage.\nExercise your democratic right and make\na difference.\nWhy you should vote... LIBERAL DEMOCRAT\nBy Gez Smith (Vice Chair, Liberal Democrat Youth and Students)\nFelix special \u25cf Thursday 28 April 2005 The General Election 2005\nUSE YOUR VOTE ON 5 MAY\n\n"

    "content": "The Wedding Date is a Pretty\nWoman remake, only this time, the\n\u2018escort\u2019 is male.\nThe movie revolves around Kat\nEllis (Debra Messing), a successful career woman in New York.\nHowever, her life is less than per-fect. Her ex-fianc\u00e9 Jeffrey (Jeremy\nSheffield) inexplicably dumped her\ntwo years ago. Her younger half-sister Amy (Amy Adams) is getting\nmarried to Ed (Jack Davenport),\nwhose best buddy \u2013 Jeffrey \u2013 will be\nthe best man at the wedding.\nHence, Kat decides to hire a top-notch male escort, Nick Mercer\n(Dermot Mulroney), to pose as her\nboyfriend to Amy\u2019s wedding. She\nwants to convince everyone that\nshe is fine despite her last relation-ship. Being a master of his trade,\nNick has a keen understanding of\nhuman behaviour. With his insight,\nhe helps her to learn to cherish\nherself again.\nWhat started as a business transaction soon turns into something\ndeeper. However, Nick finds out why\nJeffrey left her two years ago and\ndecides to hide the truth to avoid\nhurting her. Unfortunately, the truth\nis soon let out of the bag. Kat is left\nfeeling like a fool and her faith in\nNick is questioned.\nFirstly, the love story is not con-vincing. The first half of the movie\nfocuses on how pathetic Kat is, as\nshe allows people such as her tactless mother and her spoilt sister to\npush her around. The second half\ntries to show that she has changed\nwhen she tells Jeffrey to leave her\nalone.\nIt might be a failure of the script\nor that Debra Messing simply needs\nmore acting lessons, but the second half just fails to showcase Kat\nas a feisty woman with a mind of\nher own. Therefore, it is difficult to\nperceive how anyone could fall for\nher, unless of course Nick has an\nuncanny soft spot in his heart for\ndamsels in distress.\nSecondly, the flow of the story is\nnot continuous and is basically filled\nwith too much rubbish to tug at\nyour heart strings. This includes\nthe scene where Kat and her sister\ncruise around London drunk in a\nlimousine after Amy\u2019s \u2018bachelorette\u2019\nparty. It does not fit in with the main\ntheme of the story and seems like\na pathetic attempt at a \u2018Promote\nLondon\u2019 video.\nThe script tries to inject some\nhumour into the movie by poking fun\nat Kat\u2019s insecurities. One example\nwould be the scene where she had\nto try on dozens of dresses before\nshe could decide what to wear to\nher sister\u2019s wedding party. Honestly,\na fresher and more original attempt\nwould have been better suited to\nsave this film.\nThere are some good points about\nthis movie, though. It has an excellent soundtrack. Next, from a female\nperspective, it is perfectly understandable how Kat can be so riddled\nby single-woman anxiety that she\nwas willing to pay $6000 for Nick\nMercer\u2019s services. Plus, Dermot\nMulroney does have a talent for saying trashy lines such as \u201cI\u2019d rather\nfight with you than make love with\nany other woman\u201d and succeed in\nmaking them sound halfway decent.\nBut overall, it is sad to say that\nthese saving graces aren\u2019t enough\nto make The Wedding Date a worthwhile watch.\nAn unconvincing love story\nDebra Messing pays $6000 for Dermot Mulroney\u2019s services. Angela Yuen Lee is unimpressed\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 April 2005\n24\nThe Wedding Date\nDirector: Clare Kilner\nStarring: Debra Messing,\nDermot Mulroney, Amy Adams,\nJack Davenport, Jeremy Sheffield\nRunning time: 89 mins\nCertificate: 12A\nHIIII\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDebra Messing plays the insecure Kat Ellis in The Wedding Date\nWho\u2019s the white boy over there?\nPercy Jones (Bernie Mac) hasn\u2019t\nalways been the supportive dad\nwith his daughter Theresa\u2019s (Zoe\nSaldana) boyfriends. When she\ninforms him of her new boyfriend,\nSimon Green (Ashton Kutcher),\nfrom That 70s Show), who she will\nbe bringing back home for their 25th\nanniversary party weekend, Percy\ninvestigates the boy a little further\nby doing a credit check on him.\nSimon\u2019s records come back promising with a wonderful job, good\ninvestments and an assuring future.\nPercy\u2019s excitement level builds up\ndue to knowledge of the \u201csecure\u201d\nguy and he believes that his daughter may have finally found the right\nperson.\nUnfortunately, Simon isn\u2019t the\nDenzel Washington that Percy, who\nis black, was expecting. The paper\nrecords missed out the fact that\nSimon is actually white! Not that\nthis would matter unless he wants\nto marry Theresa, which he does.\nPercy, claiming to be open-minded,\nfinds out that it\u2019s just too much to\nhandle, knowing that his daughter is\ngoing out with a white guy.\nGuess Who is a pretty funny movie,\nthough I did expect to laugh a bit\nmore! The combination of Bernie\nMac and Ashton Kutcher brings out\nthe comedy side of the film. You have\nthe boy going to meet his future in-laws, who is terrified at the idea of\nmeeting Percy. Then you have the\nprotective father who just doesn\u2019t\nconsider any guy to be appropriate\nfor his daughter and wastes no time\nin displaying those emotions openly.\nThe movie\u2019s comedy relies on the\ndialogue and not on the plot. Actually\nthere isn\u2019t much of a plot anyway. It\u2019s\nall based on racial difference, which\nis mainly used as humour rather\nthan to illustrate serious points and\nlearning to accept the fact that love\nis indeed colourblind.\nSo where have we heard this story\nline? Yep, Guess Who goes in the\nsame tracks as Meet the Parents.\nHowever, Bernie Mac pulls off the\nfacial expressions much better than\nDe Niro did. As for Ashton Kutcher,\nhe doesn\u2019t live up to Bernie\u2019s performance and it seems as though he\ncould have done much better if only\nhe stopped trying so hard. However\nboth characters balance out and\nthey end up sharing a bed, a dance\nand each other\u2019s views on love.\nAdd in the race bets, which involve\ncrashing through barriers, and you\nget a more or less good comedy.\nThere isn\u2019t much to say about the\nother actors\u2019 performances. The\nwomen in the film are all strong,\nindependent, do not live in their\nmen\u2019s reflection and have a mind of\ntheir own, which does bring a little\nrefreshing difference to the normal\nromantic comedy films.\nOverall, this movie isn\u2019t very\nsmart or all that funny, though the\nmessage that is sent across isn\u2019t\nmisread or lost. The movie shows\nhow far we have come and how far\nwe still need to go.\nIt is hopeless to try to review a\nmovie like Guess Who without mentioning race. After all, the film\u2019s foundations are based on the cultural\nunfairness that still exists, opposing\ninterracial marriages. It\u2019s basically\na romantic comedy about difficulties\nin interracial relationships with mismatched individuals finding points\nof mutual understanding.\nSo is this movie highly recom-mended? Unfortunately, the answer\nis no! If you are looking for a great\nmovie to lift your spirits up and give\nyou stomach cramps, due to the\nexams just around the corner, this\nreally isn\u2019t the one to go for, though\nit can provide a few smiles. The last\nthing you need is to worry about the\nwasting of your time and money.

The \u2018first past the post\u2019 method currently favours the\ntwo main parties \u2013 in 2001, Labour and the Conservatives received\n73% of votes between them, but claimed 88% of seats in the process.\nThe Labour party also seems to benefit from the way in which the\ncountry is divided into constituencies, and a sitting government has\nthe massive advantage of choosing when the next general election\noccurs, provided it is within five years of the last one. In a country of\n60 million people, major parties have admitted to concentrating their\nefforts on less than one million key voters in crucial marginal seats,\nwhile everyone else seems to be forgotten. Recent fraud scandals\nsurrounding postal votes in Birmingham and Blackburn have only\nserved to increase the public\u2019s dissatisfaction with the system.\nBut despite these problems, and however disillusioned you might\nfeel with politicians and politics in general, it is important that you\ntake a moment to cast your vote in the 2005 general election in a\nweek\u2019s time. Only 39% of 18-to-24 year olds voted in 2001. Students\nare the future of this country and, in large numbers, they can make\na noticeable difference at the ballot box. Do you really have the right\nto complain about the way Britain is being run if you haven\u2019t tried\nto change it? As the Liberal Democrats are so keen to point out,\nthere are numerous constituencies in which the student population\nexceeds the current MP\u2019s majority. Your vote is your voice, and failure to use it is akin to admitting that you really don\u2019t care who wins.\nTurn to the centre pages for our general election pullout.\nWye and postgrads\nBeating exam stress\nAll of us have done exams at one\nstage or another. Below are some tips\nto help you reduce your stress levels\nduring this difficult time. I hope you\nfind them helpful.\nBelieve in yourself\nYou wouldn\u2019t have been given a place\non the course if you didn\u2019t have the\nability to do it. Therefore, if you prepare for the exams properly you\nshould do fine, so there is no need to\nworry excessively.\nDon\u2019t try to be perfect\nIt\u2019s great to succeed and reach for the\nstars. But keep things in perspective.\nIf you think that \u201canything less than\nA+ means I\u2019ve failed\u201d then you are\ncreating mountains of unnecessary\nstress for yourself. Aim to do your best\nbut recognise that none of us can be\nperfect all of the time.\nTake steps to overcome\nproblems\nIf you find you don\u2019t understand\nsome of your course material, getting\nstressed out won\u2019t help. Instead, take\naction to address the problem directly\nby seeing your course tutor or getting\nhelp from your classmates.\nDon\u2019t keep things bottled up\nConfiding in someone you trust and\nwho will be supportive is a great way\nof alleviating stress and worry. Make\nuse of your personal tutor and talk to\nthem. If you can\u2019t find anyone to talk\nto, the door of The Information and\nAdvice Centre is always open to anyone who needs it. You may even get a\ncup of tea.\nKeep things in perspective\nThe exams might seem like the most\ncrucial thing right now, but in the\ngrander scheme of your whole life\nthey are only a small part.\nTips for the revision period\n\u2022 Leave plenty of time to revise so\nthat you don\u2019t get into a situation of\nhaving to do last minute cramming.\nThis approach will help to boost your\nconfidence and reduce any pre-exam\nstress, as you know you have prepared\nwell.\n\u2022 Develop a timetable so that you\ncan track and monitor your progress.\nMake sure you allow time for fun and\nrelaxation so that you avoid burning\nout.\n\u2022 As soon as you notice your mind\nis losing concentration, take a short\nbreak. You will then come back to your\nrevision refreshed.\n\u2022 Experiment with several alternative\nrevision techniques so that revision is\nmore fun and your motivation to study\nis high.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t drink too much coffee, tea and\nfizzy drinks. The caffeine will \u2018hype\u2019\nyou and make your thinking less clear.\nEat healthily and regularly; your brain\nwill benefit from the nutrients.\n\u2022 Regular moderate exercise will\nboost your energy, clear your mind\nand reduce any feelings of stress.\n\u2022 Try out some yoga, tai chi or relaxation techniques. They will help to\nkeep you feeling calm and balanced,\nimprove your concentration levels and\nhelp you to sleep better.\nTips for the exam itself\n\u2022 Avoid panic. It\u2019s natural to feel some\nexam nerves prior to starting the\nexam, but getting excessively nervous\nis counterproductive as you will not be\nable to think as clearly.\n\u2022 The quickest and most effective\nway of eliminating feelings of stress\nand panic is to close your eyes and\ntake several long, slow deep breaths.\nBreathing in this way calms your\nwholenervoussystem.Simultaneously\nyou could give yourself some mental\npep-talk by mentally repeating \u201cI am\ncalm and relaxed\u201d or \u201cI know I will\ndo fine\u201d.\n\u2022 If your mind goes blank, don\u2019t panic!\nPanicking will just make it harder to\nrecall information. Instead, focus on\nslow, deep breathing for about one\nminute. If you still can\u2019t remember the\ninformation then move on to another\nquestion and return to this question\nlater.\n\u2022 After the exam don\u2019t spend endless time criticising yourself for\nwhere you think you went wrong.\nOften our own self-assessment is far\ntoo harsh. Congratulate yourself for\nthe things you did right, learn from the\nbits where you know you could have\ndone better, and then move on.\nIf you would a like a more in-depth\nchat about exam stress, then please\nfeel free to contact the Information\nand Advice Centre on 020 7594 8067 or\nadvice@ic.ac.uk. We are based in the\neast wing basement of Beit Quad.\nDon\u2019t let your concern turn in to a\ncrisis. Make the IAC your one stop\nshop for all your welfare issues.\nADVICE SERVICE\nNIGEL COOKE\nSTUDENT ADVISER\nThis term will hopefully see two\nvery important sets of elections in\nthe Union. The first is for the Wye\nCollege Union Society (WCUS). The\nsecond will be for a new postgraduate\nsabbatical and a Graduate Students\nAssociation.\nRepresenting Wye\nRegular readers will be aware that the\nWye campus is going through a process of change. All of the science teaching is closing, with the research being\nphased out. However, the applied business management course will remain\nand a College review has begun to\nidentify new academic activities to\ntake place on the campus.\nThe next few years will therefore see\nconsiderable change at Wye \u2013 much\nmore so, probably, than when Wye\nfirst merged with Imperial in 2000.\nThe College has made guarantees, I\nbelieve genuinely, that every student\nwill get the degree they signed up\nfor. However, in any change process,\ncracks develop that might get over-looked. That\u2019s why the biggest issues\nfor the Union at Wye in the next couple\nof years will be to identify areas where\nteaching quality or other student\nneeds may fall short and ensure that\nthese problems get rectified swiftly.\nThe Union\u2019s representation at Wye\nhappens largely through WCUS and\nso it\u2019s incredibly important that next\nyear\u2019s WCUS officers are level-headed\nand able to effectively represent students\u2019 needs and opinions. WCUS elections take place in about two weeks\u2019\ntime. I hope that every Wye student\ntakes an interest. The more students\ninvolved in the election process, the\nbetter officers you will get.\nEmbracing postgraduates\nYou will have read on the front page\nthat the College has agreed to fund\na new sabbatical post of Deputy\nPresident (Graduate Students). This\nis a wonderful opportunity to kickstart a Graduate Students Association\nand elections are accordingly planned\nfor mid-June. We hope to have the\nnew sabbatical in post for the new\nacademic year. Hopefully we will then\nbe able to start the work of building a\nCollege-wide representation structure\nfor graduate students.\nSTATE OF\nTHE UNION\nMUSTAFA ARIF\nUNION PRESIDENT\nEnd in sight for Babar Ahmad\nA\nBritish citizen sits in custody accused of committing acts of\nterrorism. He has been there since last August, when he was\narrested for a second time.\nIf he has committed a crime, Babar Ahmad should be tried and\nsentenced under British law. Instead, he faces the grim prospect of\nbecoming the first ever Briton extradited to the United States under\nthe Extradition Act 2003. He and his lawyers may not respond to\nthe allegations against him. No evidence needs to be put forward.\nProsecutors must simply demonstrate that a US court believes it\nhas a case.\nThe Extradition Act 2003 would appear to be a particularly dangerous piece of legislation, yet it passed through Parliament with barely\na whisper of discontent. No other country could extradite a British\ncitizen under these terms. Britain would not be able to extradite an\nAmerican citizen under these terms. And yet these terms are now\nthe law. On 17 May, a judge is due to rule on whether Babar Ahmad\nwill be extradited. We await his verdict.\nHospital closure must not\naffect teaching\nC\nurrent and prospective Imperial College medical students\nwill have reacted with concern to news that Charing Cross\nHospital may have to close. Whilst it is entirely reasonable\nthat Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust needs to look to the long\nterm and consider its financial situation, every effort must be made\nto ensure that any closure or potential closure does not affect\nstudents adversely. The President of the School of Medicine\nStudents\u2019 Union is right to say that their facilities will be fought for\nif necessary.\nIt would be regrettable if such an important hospital, both to\nImperial students and local residents, had to close its doors. It would\nbe even more regrettable if, as national newspapers have suggested,\nthe proposals are being covered up until after the general election.\n\n"

Always one step ahead,\nHolloway used their height\nadvantage to throw a number\nof deep overheads, which dD2\nstruggled to stop.\nBy the time dD2 had rediscovered their funky rhythm, it\nwas a little too late. They had\nheld Holloway off well and\nwere the only team to not be\nbeaten by the 13-point cap of\nthe first game.\ndD2 2\nStrange Blue1\n(Cambridge) 13\nThis game was likely to have\nbeen dD2\u2019s hardest match\nup. Strange Blue, the second seeds, had a reputation\nof being a consistent team,\nnever short of Ultimate talent\n(pun intended).\nAs predicted, Cambridge\nstarted the scoring, again taking advantage of dD2\u2019s lack\nof deep players. dD2 kept\nSB on their toes with quick\ncuts out of the stack, allowing\nthem to move the disc upfield\nquickly. Towards the end, dD2\nchanged their playing style:\nMunky tried some more long\nupfields to Stas who got a few\nbut who was beaten in the\nair by some of the taller SB\nplayers.\nThanks to some sweet cutting by Snazzy, Mary and\nGeorge, dD2 managed to\nscore two points against a\nvery sporting Strange Blue\nteam.\ndD2 6\nStrange Blue2\n(Cambridge) 12\nIn the next \u2018Battle of the 2nds\u2019,\ndD2 took on a very determined Strange Blue2. Eager\nto show their strength, SB2\nworked quickly to score the\nfirst three points of the game,\nbut dD2, who were determined to stop them, brought\nback the score to 6-4.\ndD2 attempted to break\nthe constant SB2 line force\nwith some \u2018dump and swing\u2019\ntactics, whilst simultaneously\nplaying their own line force.\nHats off to Denim and\nSnazzy who caught some very\nhigh discs with hands safer\nthan an international crick-eter. Unfortunately Strange\nBlue 2 walked away with the\nwin, but dD2 felt they had\nplayed a lot better during this\nmatch.\nSurrey Scorpions 6\ndD2 5\nThis was last pool game of the\nday, and dD2 were shocked to\nsee Cedric who had turned up\naround half a day late! Still,\nbetter than never.\nThe team made Cedric\nrun hard as punishment for\nsleeping all morning, as dD2\nattempted to wear-out an Iron\nman team of Scorpions.\nThe Doctors found themselves in a good position\nearly on, scoring the first few\npoints. With the sun glaring\ndown all day, playing was\ntough, but thanks to great\nhandling by Toby dD2 flew\nupfield quicker than Jo was\ngetting sunburnt.\nDespite Jay lying by the\nsideline showing his support\nfor dD2, the guys (and girls)\nbegan losing their lead over\nSurrey. A few unlucky turnovers left both teams fighting for the match at 5-5 after\ntime. dD2 had a very good\nopportunity to win, but didn\u2019t\nmanage to stop Surrey from\ngetting the final point. It was\na close match indeed, both\nteams fought well, and the\nscore could have gone either\nway.\nSince dD2 had retained\ntheir original seed in the pool,\nthey were put into a three-way round-robin on the second day with Aye Aye2 and\nHolloway Hammers2.\nAfter losing all their pool\nmatches, the only way for\ndD2 was up! Well, they could\nhave gone down further, but\nwere determined to win,\ninspired by the progress of\nthe first team. Despite losing Finnish, Toby and Cedric\non the Sunday, dD2 still had\na good roster of enthusiastic\nplayers, ready to take on Aye\nAye2.\ndD2 15\nAye Aye2 (UEA,\nNorwich) 4\nThe Aye Aye bunch are\nrenowned for being a very\nspirited team. They are regularly found singing songs and\nchanting, up until the point\nthat everyone within about a\n2km radius is about to beat\nthem to the ground with their\nfrisbees. They sang this one\nsong about how \u201cWill is the\ncaptain of their ship\u201d and how\n\u201ctheir ship is a tanker and\nWill is a...\u201d well, you get the\nidea.\ndD2 got off to a good start,\nforcing sideline and trapping\nAye Aye play. Aye Aye made\nquite a few mistakes, allowing\ndD2 to send the disc up field\nto Lisa and Stas, who worked\nhard to get to some of the\nlonger throws.\nWithafewpointsundertheir\nbelt, dD2 decided to throw a\nzone. The \u2018junk\u2019 caught Aye\nAye 2 off guard and it took\nthem a while to get used to\nit. By this time dD2 had the\nmatch well under control and\nwere working very well as a\nteam, even playing calls of\n\u2018Princes Gardens\u2019, where the\nlast player would run deep for\na long overhead.\nIt was a fun match to play.\nBoth teams were friendly\ntowards each other and everyone had a laugh at the end,\nplaying a game that involved\nslapping each other on the\nass... cheeky.\ndD2 9\nHammers2\n(Royal Holloway) 2\nIt did seem that all the way\nout on pitch 6, the number\nof spectators had more than\nquadrupled as Holloway\nHammers2 brought along all\ntheir support with them.\ndD2 still had a full, uninjured\nteam (apart from Snazzy who\nhad received a mild case of\n\u2018disc in the groin\u2019. Luckily it\nwasn\u2019t terminal).\nThe Disc Doctors fought\nwell against the home team\nadvantage. They played a\nnumber of zone variations\nand Munky even managed a\npoint block whilst chasing!\nHammers2 tried playing a\nlot of long overheads, whilst\nhandling with their bigger\nplayers.\nLuckily dD2 had it all covered and turnovers were\nquick. Skilled handling from\nJo and Denim combined with\ngreat play from G and Mary in\nthe middle kept Disc Doctors\nahead.\nAt full time, Disc Doctors\n2 had proved themselves as\none of the best 2nd teams in\nthe region. Overall they had\nfinished just behind Strange\nBlue 2 in the table.\nThis commendable achievement was thanks to every\nplayer on the team, all of\nwhom had worked hard for\nit. All the players had really\nenjoyed the weekend and\nthe experience had clearly\nimproved everyone\u2019s game.\nSummary\nThanks go out to both dD1\nand dD2 for playing their\nguts out at the tournament.\nEveryone walked away with\nhuge smiles on their faces\nand right now as dD1 prepare\nto go to the nationals, the\nwhole team is just as eager\nto succeed as before.

Having written\nand printed the necessary\ndocuments and maps, it was\nover to Amersham to set out\nthe course.\nA few snow showers threatened to hamper proceedings,\nbut fortunately they came to\nnothing.\nThisyear\u2019sbase,Amershamon-the-hill scout hut, had been\nused as the base for some\nNighthike events in previous\nyears. However, this year\u2019s\nevent was to differ from those\nin the past, which had gone\nsouth of Amersham, by heading north around Chesham.\nSoon after 8pm, the first\nof the 25 pre-entered teams\nstarted to arrive. Last minute\npreparations were still under-way, so some took the opportunity to visit the local for a\npint or two.\nAt 9.30pm, teams regis-tered, picking up their maps\nand instructions. They had to\ncopy down the descriptions of\nwhere each checkpoint was\nlocated and mark the checkpoints on their map from the\ngrid references they\u2019d been\ngiven.Checkpointswereworth\ndifferent amounts of points\nand teams had six hours to\ncollect as many points as pos-sible, so efficient route choice\nwas critical.\nThe first team set out at\n10.30pm into the dark night,\nwhere the temperature was\nalready well below zero. The\nlast left just before midnight.\nThere were two different\ncategories: \u2018novice\u2019, for those\nwho weren\u2019t very familiar with\nnavigation skills, and \u2018competent\u2019, for those with a little\nmore experience.\nNovice teams had a choice\nof visiting up to 15 checkpoints\nin the area to the north east of\nAmersham, while all 26 checkpoints were up for grabs for\nthe competent teams. Many\ncompetent teams elected to\nhead around Chesham clock-wise, as this saw them reach\nthe furthest checkpoints, and\nhence those worth the most\npoints, first.\nSituated on a fence behind\na tree only a few metres\nfrom the path, checkpoint 001\nproved elusive to a number of\nteams. The Incredibles, having fought their way through\nthe undergrowth to where\nthey thought it was, had given\nup on finding it and were making their way back to the path\nwhen they stumbled across\nit!\nThe first team to reach the\nmost northerly checkpoint,\n026, did so just after midnight\nand were surprised to be met\nby the Red Bull Energy Team\n(see picture, above left). Many\ncompetitors were energised,\nwhich kept them mentally\nfocused and alert; just what\nwas needed to keep them\ngoing for the rest of the night.\nThe muddy paths had frozen\nsolid, making the bridleways\ntreacherously uneven and\nunforgiving. Unfortunately, a\nperson from team Run Away\ntwisted their ankle so badly\nthey were forced to withdraw\nat 2.50am. They got a lift back\nto the Nighthike base in one\nof the patrolling minibuses,\nwhile the team continued.\nWarm drinks, along with\nsomething that was supposed\nto be soup but looked more\nlike wallpaper paste, awaited\nthe teams as they finished\nback at the Nighthike base.\nMost came back on time\nbetween 4.30 and 6am, with\nlessons being learned from\nlast year when lots of teams\narrived back late, incurring\nsevere penalties as a result.\nExtra time was awarded for\nvisiting manned checkpoints\nbut not everyone had read the\nrules and hence some teams\nfailed to take advantage of\nthis opportunity. Sausage and\negg sandwiches were served\nwhile results were compiled\nand we waited for the final\nteam, The Stumblers, to fin-ish.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 April 2005 5\nWe don\u2019t like to talk about it.\nMost of the time, we try to\nignore it. Death. To many, it\nis the ultimate taboo subject.\nIt is said that Alexander the\nGreat scoured his empire in\nsearch of an elixir of immor-tality. At the height of his\nempire, Ghengis Khan called\nupon a Chinese priest to ask\nhim the secret of everlasting\nlife \u2013 right until the end, Khan\ncomplained that death was\nthe only force preventing him\nfrom conquering the world.\nThroughout history, humans\nhave sought a solution to the\nproblem of death. It forms\npart of our universal culture.\nToday, there are some who\nare attempting to find an elix-ir. One such seeker, Aubrey\nde Grey, is either a visionary or a loon. Judging from\nhis outward appearance, he\nis a bit of both. Despite his\nlong, wispy beard, he looks\nfar younger than his 42 years\nwould suggest. He puts this\ndown to a carefully planned,\nwholesome diet and listening\nto his mother. Sitting cross-legged in front of an assorted\naudience of experts and non-experts at the Darwin Centre,\nhe outlined his views.\nDe Grey believes that some\nhumans alive today will go on\nto live for more than a thousand years. A ludricous pipe-dream? Thankfully for him,\nhe is also an expert in gerontology (the study of ageing) at\nCambridge University. But De\nGrey\u2019s background is actually\nin computer engineering. He\nbelieves that the problem of\nageing can be solved and that\nthe elixir will take the form of\nan engineering solution.\nIn its most simplistic form,\nDe Grey\u2019s argument is\nappealing. Ageing is a disease\nlike any other. Modern medi-cine, taken to its logical con-clusion, should prevent death\n(or \u2018deanimation\u2019 as De Grey\nlikes to call it) as a result\nof ageing. Once the relevant\nmedical tools have been engi-neered, there is no reason\nwhy humans would have to\ndie of \u2018old age\u2019.\nOf course, put in such glib\nterms, it is too easy to overlook the practical difficulties.\nThere are a few. Despite the\nprogressmadeinrecentyears,\nthe causes of ageing have not\nbeen fully understood. There\nis no consensus on whether\naccumulating DNA mutation,\ntelomere shortening after\nDNA replication or any other\nsuch mechanisms can alone\nexplain why we age.\nOne evolutionary theory\nsuggests senescence is a consequence of natural selection.\nThe reason why we age is\nbecause the damaging genes\nthat are activated in old age\nare not selected against earlier in our reproductive life.\nThese genes survive natural\nselection. But remarkably,\nsenescence is also not universal and there are species in\nwhich ageing has a neglige-able effect.\nBeyond the practical dif-ficulties, Aubrey de Grey\u2019s\nvision is questionable on a\nsociological level. If individuals were living for hundreds\nof years, what consequences\nwould this have for society?\nIn a country that is already\nstruggling under a mounting\npensions burden, do we really\nwant more old people?\nSo, perhaps thankfully,\naccording to experts such\nas Jay Oshlansky at the\nUniversity of California,\n\u201cnothing in gerontology even\ncomes close to fulfilling the\npromise of dramatically\nextended lifespan\u201d. In his\nview, the likes of De Grey are\nweaving another \u201cseductive\nweb of immortality\u201d, one that\nhas been woven since time\nimmemorial.\nWho wants to live forever?\nWho wants to find out whether humans will colonise other\nplanets, to see the moment of\nfirst contact between humans\nand an alien race? So can we\nbe forgiven for believing in\nwhat De Grey has to say?\nThe truth is that without\nany major breakthroughs, the\nscience of immortality constitutes better subject matter\nfor an episode of Doctor Who\nthan a viable area for concerted scientific research.\nThere are two problems:\none is the sheer complexity\nof the challenge, the other is\nthat not everyone actually\nwants to live forever.\nMaybe, for these reasons,\ngerontologists should be more\nfocused on improving quality\nof life rather than trying to\nflog the dream of immortal-ity... again.\nscience.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Sophie Hebden\nScience communication\nAs evidence for global warming stacks up, it is the speed\nof change that is now alarming scientists. As a result, climatologists are turning to our\ngeological record to investigate what may have amplified global warming events\nin the past and how quickly\nwe might expect things to\nchange in the future.\nAt the beginning of the\nEocene period, 55 million\nyears ago, the Earth warmed\nvery rapidly by an unprecedented amount. In some\nplaces, temperatures rose by\neight degrees in a few thousand years. In 1995, geologist\nGerald Dickens put this down\ntoanenormous\u2018burp\u2019ofmethane released from soils and\nfrom beneath the ocean floor.\nSince methane is a greenhouse gas, the trillions of\ntonnes of methane that were\nreleased into the atmosphere\nacted like an enormous blan-ket, warming things up and\ncausing sea-levels to rise. The\ntrigger for the belch, however,\nis unclear; it could have happened as ocean temperatures\nrose above a certain thresh-old, or due to a comet impact\nor a sea floor landslide.\nThe evidence for the\nEocene global warming event\ncomes from ocean-drilling\nexperiments near Antarctica.\nFossils of shells and plankton extracted from bore holes\nallow geologists to construct a\ndetailed chronology of events,\nbased on the carbon and oxy-genisotoperatiostheycontain\nthat vary over time. The car-bon-12 isotope timeline shows\nan abrupt spike, indicating a\nhuge massive release of car-bon-12 into the atmosphere\n55 million years ago. At the\nsame time there is a sudden\nleap in the proportion of oxy-gen-18 isotope in the fossils,\ncorresponding to an increase\nin sea temperatures of seven\nor eight degrees.\nThe best explanation to\ndate, Dickens\u2019 methane-burp\ntheory, ascribes the carbon\nspike to methane escaping\nfrom ice in Arctic tundra soil\nand frozen stores beneath the\nsea floor. The warming climate may then have affected\nocean circulation, so that\nonce a tipping point had been\nreached, warm water was\nchannelled down to the crystallized hydrates. This desta-bilised methane hydrates in\nthe ice, which are extremely sensitive to changes in\ntemperature and pressure,\nreleasing the methane gas.\nSome of this methane combined with dissolved oxygen\nto produce water and carbon\ndioxide.\nSince both carbon dioxide\nand methane are greenhouse\ngases, this accelerated global warming and destabilised\nmore methane hydrates in a\npositive feedback loop. Global\ntemperatures were then\nreduced over the following\n100,000 years by increased\namounts of vegetation, ocean\nphytoplankton and erosion.\nThen another rapid episode\nof global warming occurred\nduring the Jurassic period,\nabout 180 million years ago.\nThe same underlying mechanisms causing these runaway greenhouse events still\nexist today. Jan Zalasiewicz,\nof the University of Leicester,\npointed out that for these\nancient global warming\nevents, the Earth reacted\nnon-linearly to environmental stresses. \u201cA small amount\nof warming triggered a catastrophic release of methane,\u201d\nhe says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to model\nor predict\u201d.\nFurthermore, things can\ndeteriorate quickly even without a methane burp. In the\nlast glacial ice sheet melt,\nsea-levels rose by five to ten\nmetres in only a decade. Also\nthe biosphere\u2019s ability to soak\nup the damage is weaker than\nthat of pre-human times. All\nin all, the Kyoto commitment\nto reduce carbon dioxide\nemissions by 5% might not\nbe enough to avoid another\ntipping point.\nFear that giant \u2018burp\u2019 could trigger global warming\nAubrey De Grey: a visionary or a loon?\nScience science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nWho wants to live forever?\nIs ageing just another disease that can be eliminated by modern medicine or an unconquerable\nforce of nature? Darius Nikbin attended a talk at the Darwin Centre by a prophet of immortality\n\u201c...some humans\nalive today will go\non to live for more\nthan 1000 years\u201d\nIs our climate poised to suddenly change?\n\n"

After\nleaving Oxford University, he became a lawyer,\nwhich he found \u201cboring\u201d, and then went on to\nbe a graduate recruiter before starting his own\nrecruitment business.\nHe decided to become a politician because he\n\u201cfelt politics was too important to be left to somebody else\u201d. His German mother was a refugee\ntwice before her 15th birthday. He believes that\nprofessional and articulate Germans eschewing politics was \u201cone of the reasons we saw the\nrise of Hitler\u201d.\nField\u2019s political career started with a set-back, when he failed to win the \u2018safe\u2019 conservative seat of Enfield North in 1997. One wonders\nhow he went from that defeat to being selected\nas MP for the prominent Westminster constitu-ency. He was lucky.\n\u201cIn the 1997 defeat,\u201d he told me, \u201cthe Tories\nlost over half their parliamentary seats.

He, like Sir Richard Sykes, believes that\nuniversities should be independent of the state.\nIt is his view that this is the only way to stop the\n\u201cbrain-drain of our most talented youngsters\ngetting a scholarship and going to Harvard,\nStanford or wherever\u201d. He believes that a bur-sary or endowment scheme would remove the\ndisincentives of studying in Britain. But who\nwill fund a bursary scheme at Imperial? Field\nbelieves it should be the alumni \u2013 so we pay now\nand pay later!\nHis biggest worry, and one that must also\nbe felt by all of us at Imperial, is the declining\nreputation of UK universities.\n\u201cOxford, Cambridge and Imperial are already\nrapidly going down international league tables.\nThat process will only continue if we don\u2019t get it\nright. Graduating from Imperial means some-thing, that\u2019s high currency around the world. If\nin 20 or 30 years\u2019 time Imperial College was just\nanother university it would be a tragedy.\u201d\nHe believes that the government\u2019s current\ntarget of getting 50% of people into university is\na \u201cbums on seats policy. We should concentrate\nmore on quality rather than quantity.\u201d He even\ncites his own sister as \u201csomeone who should\nnever have gone to university. She got a D and\ntwo Es at A level. She ended up going into a job\nthat she could have gone into perfectly easily\nwithout going to university.\u201d\nI put it to him that surely the Liberal\nDemocrats\u2019 policy of abolishing tuition fees is\nmore attractive to students. Field says that\n\u201cno-one who votes Liberal Democrat believes\nthey are going to see a Liberal Democrat government,\u201d and \u201cno-one in the Liberal Democrat\nparty believes that,\u201d so they can afford to make\npromises that haven\u2019t been properly thought\nthrough.\nThe \u2018real opposition\u2019\nCharles Kennedy recently declared that the\nLiberal Democrats are \u201cthe real opposition\u201d. Is\nField scared of the Liberal threat? \u201cThe reality of the situation is, Liberal Democrat policy\ndoesn\u2019t hang together\u201d.\nBut he is under no illusions with regard to\nthe failings of recent Tory leaders: \u201cIn all hon-esty, if one looks at Iain Duncan Smith and\nWilliam Hague, I don\u2019t think one could really\nenvisage them walking through the door of\nnumber 10\u201d.\nHe has more belief in the current Tory lead-er, Michael Howard: \u201cHe\u2019s a credible figure...\n[but] people are never going to love Michael\nHoward\u201d. Field thinks \u201cHoward is not suited\nto the Richard & Judy thing. He should play to\nhis strengths \u2013 the intellectual abilities.\u201d Field\ndoes not believe Howard, 64, is too old to run\nthe country, although he concedes that \u201che will\nneed a young team around him\u201d.\nEconomic migrants but not refugees\nField believes that the UK should pull out of\nthe UN convention on refugees \u201cbecause it\u2019s\nnot working\u201d. He is worried about maintaining \u201csustainable numbers\u201d of refugees, despite\nthe fact that his \u201cown mother was ethnically\ncleansed\u201d and found refuge in the UK. In con-trast, he is a strong believer in the idea of\neconomic migration. \u201cIf they want to make a\ncontribution, bring \u2018em in,\u201d he says.\nWar in Iraq\nThe Conservative candidate voted in favour of\nthe war in Iraq and doesn\u2019t regret it. However,\nhe wishes that Tony Blair had been up front\nabout the reasons why Britain went to war.\n\u201cIf he had stood up and said, \u2018look, we owe\nAmerica for the last 100 years,\u2019 the people\nwould have respected that. But he was dishon-est. He simply didn\u2019t tell the truth at all.\u201d\nLondon\nField has always been against the London congestion charge, despite its\u2019 success at reducing\ntraffic. \u201cIt has not made enough money,\u201d he\nargues. He is against the enlargement of the\ncongestion charge to include the area around\nImperial College, even though this would drastically reduce commuting times for those of us\nwho travel by bus.\nHe is not too enthusiastic about London\u2019s\nOlympic bid either, and is sceptical as to whether Tony Blair would be so keen if we were not\nin a election period. However, Field is a big\nsports fan and supported Bury FC, who currently languish in League Two. \u201cI think their\nfortunes are even worse than the Tory party\u2019s\nin recent years\u201d.\nHis constituency includes Soho, and he is\nsurprisingly liberal for a Tory, believing in \u201c\u2018live\nand let live\u2019 on gay rights and those sorts of\nissues\u201d.\nThe NHS and MRSA\nLike most politicians, Field can wax lyrical\nabout the threat of MRSA and dirty hospitals,\nbut he failed the Felix Science question: what\ndoes MRSA stand for? He said: \u201cThat\u2019s a latin\nquestion isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m going to have to fail on\nthat one\u201d.\nI\u2019m sure you all know the answer, but just in\ncase, it\u2019s Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus\nAureus.\nThe other candidates\nField is quietly confident that he will be re-elect-ed, although he is sitting on a majority of only\n4,500. He didn\u2019t appear particularly concerned\nwhen I told him that the President of Imperial\nCollege Union, Mustafa Arif, could be standing\nagainst him.\nAfter a few chuckles, Field stated: \u201cIt\u2019s a free\ncountry, and he\u2019s entitled to stand if he likes,\nbut there might be other candidates I\u2019m a bit\nmore concerned about\u201d. Arif has since decided\nnot to stand.\nIf he\u2019s successful in the upcoming election, I\nbelieve we\u2019ll be seeing more of Mark Field. His\npolitical ambitions include holding ministerial\noffice, for London, International Development\nor Foreign Affairs.\n\u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe\u2019ll worry about getting\nre-elected here and getting into government\nfirst.\u201d\nIf Blair had said \u2018look, we owe\nAmerica for the last 100 years,\u2019\npeople would have respected\nthat. But he was dishonest\n\u201c \u201c\nOxford, Cambridge and Imperial\nare already rapidly going down\ninternational league tables\n\u201c \u201c\nT\nhe trouble with politics and government,\nsays Hywel Lloyd, is that they always\ndisappoint. \u201cIn politics,\u201d he continues,\n\u201cit\u2019s very rare for people to be able to say\n\u2018I\u2019ve achieved what I set out to do, and now I\ncan stop.\u2019\u201d Nonetheless, Lloyd, who describes\nhimself as an \u201coptimistic pragmatist\u201d, is aiming to become the first ever Labour MP for the\nCities of London and Westminster. The thought\noccurs that he might well be disappointed when\nthe result is announced on 5 May, but he insists\nhe has a \u201creasonable chance\u201d of victory.\nBorn in 1964 to Welsh parents, Lloyd grew\nup with \u201cthe sense that I\u2019d always wanted to\nbe in politics\u201d. He studied chemistry at Bath\nUniversity, where he was also elected president\nof the students\u2019 union.\nAfter that, he ran a nightclub for two years\nand then worked for a charity for the deaf. He\nsays his varied experiences have allowed him\nto \u201cpick up a fair amount of what I\u2019d call real\nlife. My job now is as a management consultant\nin public services, but I\u2019ve worked in the voluntary sector, I\u2019ve worked in the public sector, I\u2019ve\nrun a business, I\u2019ve started one and I\u2019ve had a\ncouple fall over, so I think I\u2019ve got a reasonable\nsense of what it is that really means something\nto people.\u201d\nUniversities\nLloyd claims that the new top-up fees arrange-ment, which comes into effect next year, is\n\u201cdefinitely a fairer system than existed\u201d, but,\nnot for the first time in this interview, he reveals\nthat his own view is different to the party line.\n\u201cMy personal preference,\u201d he says, \u201cwould be\nfor a graduate tax that applies to all graduates,\nincluding me. But the party and the population\nin general don\u2019t accept that way of gathering\nmoney\u201d.\nI put it to him that Labour\u2019s seemingly arbitrary target of 50% of young people entering\nhigher education will not only make it increasingly difficult for graduates to obtain jobs but\nwill also lead to a shortage of workers in key\nareas that do not require a degree.\nLloyd counters: \u201cIt\u2019s a profound part of\nLabour\u2019s philosophy that more and more people should gain the opportunities that education\ncan give them. It might well be more difficult for\ngraduates to get jobs, but I don\u2019t see that as an\nargument for denying others the right to a good\neducation. You could have a superb service for a\nvery small number of students, which would be\nthe academic envy of the planet, but that isn\u2019t\nthe point.\u201d\nHowever, he accepts that \u201cit would have been\nboth more understandable and more coherent\u201d\nif, in 1997, the government had also dealt with\nwhat he calls \u201cthe missing part of the equation\u201d,\nensuring that the other 50% of young people\nwould have opportunities to level 4 or 5 on an\nNVQ scale, be they vocational qualifications or\notherwise.\nWar in Iraq\nIf he had been in Parliament at the time, how\nwould Lloyd have voted on attacking Iraq? He\nbegins his response like a typical politician, only\nto surprise me at the end:\n\u201cWe did endeavour to use the UN and have\nit make a collective judgement on what should\nhappen. It didn\u2019t go all the way with what\nBritain and America wanted, so then we had\nto make a judgement \u2013 do we go or not? The\nPrime Minister made the judgement to go, but\nas a back-bencher I would have made the judgement not to. I would have voted against.\u201d\nHis reasons are interesting, too. \u201cPartly from\nan environmental perspective,\u201d he argues, \u201cwar\nis a very wasteful way of solving problems.\u201d\nGoing green\nLloyd lists \u2018the environment\u2019 as one of his\nmajor interests. He is co-chair of the Socialist\nEnvironment and Resources Association\n(SERA), and when I ask him if he has any ideas\non how Imperial can improve its impact on the\nenvironment, he replies with enthusiasm:\n\u201cProbably hundreds! There\u2019s got to be a way\n\u2013 and students can be involved in it \u2013 of making\nthe College sign up to various voluntary codes.\nUniversities can actually save money, or at least\nuse resources more effectively, if they have a\nbetter sense of \u2018where is our energy use? Are\nour buildings properly insulated?\u2019\n\u201cI think a lot of student feedback could work\nhere. You can use a technical or economic argu-ment: maybe we can save 10% of our energy\nbudget [and help the environment at the same\ntime].\u201d\nI suggest that, given the emphasis he places\non environmental issues, Lloyd might be more\nsuited to the Green Party than Labour. His\nresponse is swift, short and demonstrative of\nhis political ambitions: \u201cThe Green party is\nnever going to be in power.\u201d\nNegative campaigning\nOn a Labour party promotional web page entitled \u2018Cities of London and Westminster forward not back\u2019, just over half the text relates\nto how bad the area would become under the\nConservatives. Lloyd argues that Labour are\nnot being negative: \u201cI think the party has got\na profoundly positive message, but what\u2019s difficult is getting that past some newspapers.\u201d\nHowever, he does take the chance to have\na dig at the Tories. \u201cThe point does have\nto be made that you\u2019re choosing between a\nConservative government and a Labour gov-ernment, and if you\u2019re facing that choice you\nneed to know what the alternative is going to\nlook like. The Conservative manifesto is pretty\nlight on anything, in terms of what they\u2019ll do,\nhow it will work and how it will add up...\u201d\nLloyd expects that Labour will maintain a\nlarge majority in Parliament. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine\npeople will wake up on 5 May in the morning\nand think \u2018right, Michael Howard will be better\nfor Britain\u2019\u201d, he says confidently.\nLondon\nLloyd is backing the capital\u2019s 2012 Olympic bid,\nbut he urges caution because \u201cParis already\nhas most of its infrastructure in place and all\nof that.\u201d After a long pause, he says that the\nbid is worth the money even though London\nis less likely to succeed than Paris, because\nthe process will help to \u201cdrive collaboration\u201d\nand \u201cregenerate the north east quadrant of\nLondon\u201d.\nAnd what about the congestion charge? \u201cI\nthink managing traffic is very important, and\nat the moment the congestion charge and road\npricing is the best mechanism we\u2019ve got.\u201d\nWhat are his chances?\nThe turnout in the Cities of London and\nWestminster was just 47.4% in 2001. Less than\n22% of constituents voted for Mark Field, the\nConservative MP\n, who is standing again this\nyear. This is just one reason why Lloyd feels\nthat he can win.\nHe also points out that \u201cthe Liberal vote last\ntime was greater than the Conservative major-ity, and the Liberals don\u2019t appear to be fighting\nthis seat, because they don\u2019t appear to consider\nit winnable in their terms.\u201d\nI am surprised to discover that, at the time\nof the interview, three weeks before polling day,\nLloyd and Field have never met. Lloyd seems\nunconcerned by this, and suggests a reason for\nit: \u201cI\u2019m out there doing stuff; he\u2019s not.\u201d\nPerhaps, with an unexpected victory on 5\nMay, Lloyd can stave off the disappointment\nof politics for a while longer and cause Field to\nexperience it instead.\nMark Field on\nrecent Tory\nleaders: \u201cIn all\nhonesty, if one\nlooks at Iain\nDuncan Smith and\nWilliam Hague,\nI don\u2019t think\none could really\nenvisage them\nwalking through\nthe door of\nnumber 10.\u201d\nHywel Lloyd on\nthe 50% target:\n\u201cIt\u2019s a profound\npart of Labour\u2019s\nphilosophy that\nmore and more\npeople should gain\nthe opportunities\nthat education can\ngive them.\u201d\nL\nocal councillor Jenny Kingsley left the\nConservative party in 2003 as she felt she\ncould not support its views on the war\nin Iraq, and because of the \u201clack of transparency and accountability\u201d in the Tory-controlled\ncouncil\u2019s dealings with the public. Kingsley, now\na Liberal Democrat, is an elected member for\nCremorne, a ward in the borough of Kensington\nand Chelsea.\nSince she defected, people who she once\nregarded as friends now snub Kingsley in pub-lic. This childish behaviour of Tory councillors,\n\u201cmany of whom should have retired from the\ncouncil by now,\u201d although clearly making life\nhard, just reaffirms to her that she made the\nright decision.\nNot intimidated by the actions of those coun-cillors, Kingsley, 47, decided to stand as the\nLiberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for\nKensington and Chelsea, one of the safest Tory\nseats in the country. She has very little respect\nfor Michael Rifkind, the Conservative candi-date, or Michael Portillo, the incumbent, who is\nstepping down after six years.\nShe believes that Rifkind, who lives in\nScotland, \u201cis not interested in local issues\u2026 he\nlooked like he\u2019d fallen asleep in a meeting once\u201d\nand has been \u201cgiven this seat because the\nTories see it as less of a challenge\u201d. Yet Rifkind,\ndespite having had so much trouble finding a\nparliamentary seat, is touted as a possible successor to Howard, should the Conservatives\nlose the election.\nOne may wonder if Kingsley has switched\nallegiance purely out of personal political ambi-tion. She was a two-a-penny local Councillor\nwith the Tories, but by switching to the Liberals\nshe has increased her profile considerably.\nShe argues that there was \u201cno perceivable\npolitical advantage\u201d to be gained by the defec-tion, which was \u201csoul-destroying\u201d. She says her\nreasons for standing are altruistic: \u201cWe need a\nlocal champion to bring local issues to parliament.\u201d\nIn fact, her local roots (not in a League Of\nGentlemen way) seem to be her trump card.\nShe equates Rifkind\u2019s likely involvement in local\nissues to \u201chaving a girlfriend who you never see\n\u2013 you can\u2019t maintain a decent relationship\u201d.\nKingsley says she believes in the principles\nof the Liberal Democrats. But she does not\nooze liberal ideals: she lives in a sizeable property close to South Kensington tube station,\nboth of her sons went to Eton, and the NHS is\nnot her family\u2019s primary health care provider.\nShe admits that although in the past she \u201cdid\nnot view the Liberal Democrats as a credible\npolitical force,\u201d she does now. \u201cThey seemed\nwoolly... they didn\u2019t seem to take themselves as\nseriously as they deserved.\u201d\nThe \u2018real opposition\u2019\nCharles Kennedy recently declared that the\nLiberal Democrats are the \u2018real opposition\u2019.\nKingsley believes that the party will pick up\nvotes from both Labour and the Tories as a\nresult of the war in Iraq, the public\u2019s lack of\ntrust in the present government and their lack\nof faith in the Tories\u2019 ability to deliver.\nAccording to Kingsley, her leader doesn\u2019t live\nup to the heavy drinking portrait painted by the\nmedia. She finds Kennedy \u201cfriendly, confident\nand extremely focused,\u201d and believes he is \u201can\nexcellent leader\u201d. Kingsley believes that nationally the Liberals can \u201cat most win; at least come\nsecond\u201d.\nWar in Iraq\nAn American by birth, Kingsley believes that\n\u201cwhat a country might have is not justification\nfor waging war\u201d. Although she feels the war\nwas \u201cagainst America\u2019s spirit of liberty,\u201d she is\nnot ashamed to be called an American.\nUniversities\nAccording to Kingsley, \u201cstudents are the future\nof liberal democracy\u201d. She is hardly surprised\nthat we are sometimes made to feel unwelcome by our neighbours: \u201cThere is a very\nunsavoury feeling amongst residents towards\nyoung people.\u201d She suspects that the opposition against the Southside redevelopment on\naesthetic grounds could be a \u201cpretext\u201d for anti-student feeling.\nShe loved her time as a student, studied\nSocial Anthropology at LSE and received an MA\nin International Relations from Georgetown,\nWashington DC.\nThe congestion charge\nKingsley is opposed to the extension of the\nLondon congestion charge, as it will adversely\naffect local businesses. She would prefer a\n\u201croad pricing\u201d scheme.\nWhat are her chances?\nJenny Kingsley has a considerable uphill struggle to even make a dent in the Conservative\nmajority \u2013 in 2001 Portillo collected 54% of the\nvote \u2013 but Labour, on 23%, may be catchable.\nThe Liberals received 16%.\nWhat about the threat posed by minor par-ties? In 2001, Ginger Crab of the Jam Wrestling\nparty received 100 votes. I don\u2019t think Kingsley\nis quaking in her boots.\nI can\u2019t imagine people will wake\nup on 5 May in the morning and\nthink \u2018right, Michael Howard will\nbe better for Britain\u2019\n\u201c \u201c\nMy personal preference would\nbe for a graduate tax that applies\nto all graduates, including me\n\u201c \u201c\nWe need a local champion to\nbring local issues to Parliament\n\u201c \u201c\nStudents are the future of\nliberal democracy\n\u201c \u201c\nJenny Kingsley on Charles Kennedy and the\nparty\u2019s chances: \u201cHe is friendly, confident\nand extremely focused...

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 April 2005\n4\nBusiness business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nPoverty could finally be history\nThe US and UK have taken several steps closer to providing mass debt relief for\npoor countries. Numaan Chaudhry takes an objective view\nLast week, the US and Britain\nedged closer to an agreement\nthat could provide billions\nof dollars in debt relief for\nimpoverished nations, but\nthey remained split over the\nquestion of whether to provide even more new aid to\nrelieve global poverty.\nThe negotiations raised\nhopes that the two nations\n\u2013 who are leading the debate\namong G7, the Group of Seven\nmajor industrial powers \u2013 will\nbe able to settle on a developing world debt plan by the\ntime their leaders meet in\nScotland in July.\n\u201cWe believe we can make\nsubstantial progress in the\nnext few months in alleviating debts of poor countries\nand increasing the resources\navailable for poverty reduction,\u201d British chancellor\nGordon Brown told reporters after a meeting of top\neconomics officials from G7\nnations on Saturday.\n\u201cIt is now recognised for\nthe first time as a result of\nthese meetings that more\nmoney will have to be made\navailable.\u201d\nMr Brown\u2019s claims of\nprogress appear overstated,\nhowever. So far, US President\nGeorge W Bush, who faces\nenormous federal deficits\nand tough budget fights with\nCongress, hasn\u2019t agreed to\nprovide additional financial\naid for the developing world,\naccording to US officials.\nFor itspart,theBushadmin-istration said over the weekend that it persuaded Britain\nthat any effort to address the\n$40bn that 33 countries owe\nthe World Bank and African\nDevelopment Bank must\ninclude a complete write-off\n-- not just relief from debt\npayments, as the UK had pro-posed.\nUnder the US plan, debt\ncancellation would be\nfinanced through World Bank\nresources, not additional\nfunding from the US and\nother wealthy nations. British\nofficials say the US approach\nis acceptable only if it comes\nwith new aid resources.\nBehind closed doors, the G7\nfinance ministers discussed\nrising oil prices, slow growth\nin Europe, massive US budget deficits and tensions over\nChina\u2019s policy of keeping its\ncurrency artificially weak\nagainst the dollar and euro.\nNonetheless, the ministers\nfrom the US, Britain, France,\nItaly, Germany, Japan and\nCanada concluded that\n\u201cthe global expansion has\nremained robust and the\noutlook continues to point to\nsolid growth for 2005\u201d.\nThe finance ministers,\nmany of whom believe their\nnations\u2019 companies are\nunfairly handicapped by the\nartificially low value of the\nyuan, reiterated their hope\nthat China would adopt a\nmore flexible exchange rate\nsystem. French finance minister Thierry Breton told\nreporters that the ministers\nconsidered it \u201cclear that the\nyuan is undervalued and\nthere was a consensus that\nChina has to address this\u201d.\nChina keeps the yuan in a\ntight range of around 8.3 to\nthe dollar.\nUS officials, under pressure\nfrom Capitol Hill to defend\nUS manufacturers against\nChinese competition, have\nbeen particularly vocal in\nrecent days about Beijing\u2019s\ncurrency practices.\nUS treasury secretary John\nSnow took the opportunity at\nthe G7 meeting to repeat the\nBush administration\u2019s line\nthat China has taken all of the\nnecessary preliminary steps\nand should now relax its hold\non the yuan.\nUS negotiators broached\nthe subject of inserting sharper language aimed at China\ninto the joint G7 statement,\nbut the group rejected that\nidea as potentially counter-productive. \u201cIt\u2019s ultimately up\nto China to decide, and I hope\nChina makes the right call,\u201d\nJapanese Finance Minister\nSadakazu Tanigaki said.\nThe UK, which holds the\none-year rotating presidency\nof the G7, is using its position\nto press for more assistance\nfor poor nations, particularly\nin sub-Saharan Africa. The\ninitiative has led to months of\nsparring with the US.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair\nfaces a general election on\nMay 5 and has been losing\nsome popularity because of\nhis support for Mr Bush and\nthe war in Iraq. Mr Blair and\nMr Brown, who is considered\nto have his eye on the top job\nin the UK, have staked a good\ndeal of their personal prestige\nand political fortunes on the\npromise that they will come\nto Africa\u2019s rescue.\nMr Blair has called for a\ndoubling of aid flows from the\nrich world to the poor world,\nto $100bn a year. Privately,\nUS officials complain that\nthe Bush administration\nisn\u2019t getting credit for the\naid increases the president\nhas already put into place,\nincluding his AIDS programs\nand his signature Millennium\nChallenge Account, which\nis slated to provide its first\ngrant today, a $110m package\nfor Madagascar.\nDespite Mr Brown\u2019s claims\nthat the issue is settled, the\nG7 ministers left open the\nquestion of additional aid in\nthe communiqu\u00e9 issued at\nthe conclusion of their meet-ing.\nThe group cited \u201cprogress\u201d\nin agreeing \u201cto provide as\nmuch as 100% reduction\u201d in\ndebts \u201cwithout reducing the\nresources available to the\npoorest countries through\nthese institutions.\u201d\n\u25cf Colin Smith, page 7\nNEWS FROM THE\nSQUARE MILE\nFormer JP Morgan\nexecutive probed\nMichael Weinberg, a former\ntop real estate executive at\nJPMorgan, the multinational\ninvestment bank, is being\ninvestigated for possible\nwrongdoing in the awarding\nof contracts.\nThe inquiry, conducted\nby the New York law firm\nPaul, Hastings, Janofsky &\nWalker LLP\n, is looking at Mr\nWeinberg\u2019s relationship with\nJT Magen & Co, a New York\nconstruction company that\nundertook work for the bank\nand also on Mr Weinberg\u2019s\npersonal apartment in New\nYork.

The hospital\u2019s\nmain services would transfer\nto the Hammersmith hospital\nin Acton, but no-one knows\nwhat the future will hold for\nImperial College teaching at\nthe site.\nAccording to an article in\nThe Observer, \u201cconsultants\nat both hospitals were told of\nthe plans last week, but were\nwarned by their chief executive that it would be officially\ndenied if the plans emerged\nin the run-up to [general\nelection] polling day\u201d. The\nelectorate\u2019s opinions on any\nclosure or partial closure\ncould dramatically influence\nthe result in the key marginal seat of Hammersmith\nand Fulham, where Labour\ncurrently holds a majority of\naround 2,000.\nThe plans are likely to be\nofficially unveiled in June,\nand there will be a full public\nconsultation before any final\ndecisions are made.\nIn a statement, Derek\nSmith, chief executive of\nHammersmithHospitalsNHS\nTrust, announced: \u201cWe expect\nto have to spend up to \u00a3400m\non renewing our estate during the next ten years. With\nthat level of investment, we\nhave to look at all the options\navailable to us to demonstrate\nthat what we\u2019re planning is\nthe best way of spending public funds. We are looking at\noptions at the moment, but\nas yet have no plans, so have\nnothing yet to consult on, and\nare unlikely to have for some\ntime yet.\u201d\nProfessor Stephen Smith,\nPrincipal of the Imperial\nCollege Faculty of Medicine,\nresponded: \u201cHammersmith\nHospitals NHS Trust is currently considering a range\nof options with respect to\ntheir service configura-tion.

    "content": "\u201cI\nf you vote Green, you\u2019re wasting\nyour vote.\u201d That\u2019s normally the key\nargument I hear as to why someone\nwill not be voting Green in any election. They\nconsider a vote for a minority party to be a\nwaste, as minority parties don\u2019t win and if\nyou vote for them you\u2019ll just (a) let the Tories\nwin, or (b) give Blair five more years (delete\nas appropriate).\nFaced with this argument, you can see\nwhy the Green Party has needed tenacity\nduring its 30-year life. In each election since\n1974 we\u2019ve contested seats, won votes, lost\ndeposits, kept deposits, beaten the Tories\nand beaten Labour, but we still haven\u2019t been\nelected to Parliament in a \u2018first past the post\u2019\nelectoral system.\nBut if you vote for a party you don\u2019t believe\nin, isn\u2019t that a wasted vote? Voting for a party\nwith beliefs you share is surely the right way\nto vote. There are certainly arguments for\ntactical voting, but in most constituencies in\nthe UK the same old party will win it, presumably because voters don\u2019t want to \u2018waste\ntheir vote\u2019 by voting differently. So we end up\nwith the status quo. Again.\nIf I had a penny for the number of times\nI\u2019ve heard the following phrase, I\u2019d be a mil-lionaire, (or at least wouldn\u2019t have an over-draft): \u201cI agree with everything the Greens\nsay but I\u2019ve always voted Labour so I\u2019m\ngoing to vote Labour.\u201d\nThe very implication is that they don\u2019t particularly want to vote Labour \u2013 it\u2019s just like a\nvery bad habit they can\u2019t give up! So why not\nvote in a different way? Did you agree with\nthe invasion of Iraq, on spurious grounds of\nhidden weapons? Or do you think that top-up\nfees are the best way to ensure all Britons\nget a fair chance at a quality education that\nsuits them? Perhaps you\u2019d like to know\nwhy National Insurance has gone up under\nLabour whilst public spending on health is\nstill less than public spending on \u2018defence\u2019.\nGreens approach both foreign and domestic affairs in a holistic manner that would see\npublic funding given to conflict resolution\nwithout violence and increased provision of\nlocal, familial health care through a universal benefit, called the citizens\u2019 income.\nTake Europe \u2013 why are we hell-bent on joining a federal economic model where we lose\nnational sovereignty over important national\ntools like our ability to set interest rates? Or\nback to the defence issue, will the proposed\nEU Constitution just serve to force us to\nput more money towards enormous defence\nprojects? Looking at the experience of other\nnations, Germany for example, we can see\nthat the single currency has actually caused\nthem immense national economic difficulties\n\u2013 rising unemployment, lower labour costs\nfrom intra-EU competitors and the inability to set appropriate national interest rates\nhave given them no end of problems.\nGreens aren\u2019t anti-Europe; far from it \u2013\nwe have a rich history of internationalism\n\u2013 but we are anti-Euro. Whilst some modern\nindustries are indeed global \u2013 communica-tions, oil, electronics to name but a few, it\nhasn\u2019t escaped us that we still rely on local\neconomies for a lot of our needs \u2013 food,\nwater, friends, and most of the social fabric\nwe rely on. Localisation is a key tenet of\ngreen thinking. Local economies, local com-munities, local food and water production\nall serve to keep our own communities alive\nand well.\nIn an age of over-arching globalisation,\naren\u2019t we forgetting something a little more\nfundamental to our own well-being? In spite\nof ever-growing GDP\n, last month there was\nthe tragic story of a man found dead in his\ncouncil flat, six years after he actually died.\nThe Coroner was reported to have remarked:\n\u201cWe need to ask what sort of society could let\nthis happen?\u201d We do indeed. We will never\nachieve a just, close-knit, trusting society if\nwe forget about all the ingredients for such\na society!\nAsylum and immigration seem to be emotive issues at this election. Only the Greens\nwould tackle the root causes of economic\nmigration, ensuring fairer distribution and\ntaking a tough stance on the real tax cheats.\nOh, and I almost forgot to mention our\nclear commitment to progressive environmental issues.\nWhoever you vote for in this election, make\nsure you believe in what you\u2019re voting for.\nDon\u2019t waste your vote voting for a party you\ndon\u2019t believe in and can\u2019t trust. Vote Green.\nWhy you should vote...\nGREEN\nBy Tom Tibbits (Green party national spokesperson for\nenergy and Imperial College PhD student)\nR\nespect is a political party born out\nof the mass anti-war demonstrations\nand opposition to an increasingly\nright wing political climate. Since its formation in January 2004, it has made astonishing\nprogress. Respect was formed as an alternative to the three main parties: the warmongering New Labour, the Conservatives who\nfully supported them in going into Iraq, and\nthe Liberal Democrats who turned their\nbacks on the anti-war movement and backed\nthe carnage the second it started.\nRespect stands on an anti-war and anti-privatisation platform. When local schools\nand hospitals are already under-funded in\nsome areas, their privatisation will not help\nmatters by making ordinary working people use services that will deteriorate further in the hands of big business, putting\nprofit before people. Respect wants more\ninvestment of funds to provide decent public\nservices.\nThe war on Iraq and continued occupation\nis still the central issue of these elections.\nThe Labour Government killed over 100,000\nIraqis and wasted \u00a36bn in a war based on a\nlie about the existence of weapons of mass\ndestruction. This money could easily have\nbeen used to provide the things that Respect\nstands for. \u00a31bn would allow for each of\nthese:\n\u2022 Scrapping the top-up fees we will see very\nsoon for university students.\n\u2022 Raising the basic state pension to \u00a3100 a\nweek (not means tested) and installing free\ncentral heating and full insulation in 370,000\nhomes.\n\u2022 Building eight new hospitals with state of\nthe art equipment.\n\u2022 Building a family centre in every constituency providing healthcare and homework\nclubs for children.\nRespect are targeting 30 specific constitu-encies, including those where they did fantastically well in last year\u2019s European elec-tions. For instance, in Newham, Respect\ncame second with 32% of the vote, being\nbeaten by Labour with 42%. Respect beat\nboth the Conservatives, who polled only 15%,\nand the Liberal Democrats, with 11%. Just a\n5% swing could bring victory for Respect.\nRespect is very well placed to win seats\nin several parts of East London, particularly in the area of Bethnal Green and Bow\nwhere George Galloway is standing. Also\nLindsey German (convenor of the Stop the\nWar Coalition) has a good chance of taking a seat in West Ham, where the Liberal\nDemocrats recently withdrew their original\ncandidate and the local press are pitching the battle as a two-horse race between\nRespect and Labour. Respect is also mounting a strong challenge in areas such as\nPlymouth, Bristol, Birmingham, Preston and\nLeicester.\nIf any Respect candidate manages to gain\na seat, it would be a massive blow to the\nLabour government, and a boost to the\nmajority of ordinary people who lack real\nrepresentatives in Parliament. It would show\nthat the British public elected an anti-war,\nanti-privatisation candidate and that the\nmajority of the public now believe that going\nto war was wrong. It would also place in\nparliament someone who is not fed on lies by\ntheir leadership and will be willing to tackle\nthe other parties on issues such as education\nand healthcare.\nThe Labour Government said they would\nrather lose thirty seats to the Tories than\nhave a Respect MP in parliament. This is\nthe kind of impact that Respect are having\nwithout any seats. Just imagine the gains\nwith a Respect MP\n.\nBut seats cannot be won without campaign-ing. There are people from Imperial going\nto help out in East London this Saturday,\nand on polling day itself (next Thursday),\nand there are many more activists working\naround the area. More are still needed to\nhelp in the run-up to the election. If you want\nto be part of the Respect campaign and want\nto help out, there are many things going on\nat the moment. Please email swss@ic.ac.uk\nfor more information.\nIf there isn\u2019t a Respect candidate in your\narea then vote with your feet and get over\nto East London to help campaign for what\nare looking set to be some historic results.\nIf a Respect candidate is standing in your\nconstituency, then when it comes to 5 May,\nmake your vote count.

My own personal opinion\nis that they must be having a\nlaugh at my expense \u2013 during\nthe preparation of this article,\nwe forgot to take the photos,\nI forgot to write the article,\nI lost the fire extinguisher\nfor a few days (how do you\nlose a bright red fire extinguisher in a small cupboard?)\nand I nearly poured paraffin\nall over my feet. Which just\ngoes to show that the ancient\nChinese can\u2019t have been that\nsmart after all.\nThe devil stick is one of\nthe finer Chinese inventions\n(after such inconsequential\nthings as gunpowder, paper\nand the decimal system),\nconsisting of a pair of hand-sticks and a short \u2018centre\u2019\nstick. When European missionaries went to Asia, they\ntook the idea back home with\nthem, and since they couldn\u2019t\npronounce \u2018Hua Kun\u2019 prop-erly, they named it \u2018devil stick\u2019\ninstead.\nFirst thing\u2019s first: fire safe-ty. Don\u2019t wear artificial fibres,\nand always have a fire extinguisher nearby [see picture\n1]. You should also bring a\nfire blanket and a friend. The\nfriend is very important, since\nthey will tell you that the artificial fibres you\u2019re wearing\nlook crap. As usual, nobody\nis responsible for your burns\nother than yourself \u2013 if you\ndon\u2019t think you can handle the\ndevil stick competently and\nsafely, don\u2019t pick it up.\nStart in the position in picture 2, without the stick on\nfire to start with \u2013 since you\u2019re\nabout to let one end drop, it\nwould make sense to check\nwhether you can keep the\nstick in the air before you set\nfire to your toes. The position\nof the handsticks is important\n\u2013 they should be about four\ninches from the end of the\ndevil stick.\nOK, now let one end drop\n[see picture 3]. There will\nbe a brief moment of panic\nas a ball of fire travels past\nyour genitals, during which\nyou wait until it is at about\n45 degrees before you gently\n\u2018throw\u2019 the devil stick across\nto the other handstick. Once\nit\u2019s there, catch it on the other\nhandstick then throw it back.\nPause a second to laugh in\nthe face of both gravity and\ndeath, before trying something more tricky.\nTo get into a horizontal spin,\nstart from the position above,\nbut every time you catch and\nthrow with your right hand,\npush the devil stick a little bit\nforward, and with your left\nhand, push a little bit towards\nyou. After a while, the stick\nwill level out and spin horizontally [see picture 4].\nAlternatively you can throw\nit under your leg. Lift your leg\nin the same way as a dog at a\nfire hydrant, place your hand-stick under the leg and tap\nthe devil stick as before [see\npicture 5]. Observant readers\nwill no doubt be aware that\nthis is similar to the top secret\nhandshake of the masons \u2013 try\nit on a suspected mason when\nyou next meet one.\nThat\u2019s all there is to it.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of other\ntricks you can try, and if you\nfancy a go at fire juggling,\ndiabolo, devil stick, poi and\nso on, all in the (relative)\nsafety of Beit Quad, then\nyou can come to juggling on\nTuesdays from 6pm.

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 28 April 2005\nNightlife clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThe idea I had was to go out every\nnight over the weekend and make a\ndiary of where I went.\nI needed someone else to come\nalong, so off I went trying to find one\nof my friends who was willing to do\nthe whole thing. That\u2019s when I realised that not many people want to\ncompletely abuse their bodies.\nA lot of friends were up for it until\nthey heard what would be happen-ing, then they told me to stop being\nstupid \u2013 apparently you need sleep,\ndon\u2019t you know? Anyway I asked my\nfriend Mike, who agreed. He doesn\u2019t\nlike his course much anyway and\ndidn\u2019t care about being off his face\nfor the whole weekend.\nThe plan was to start on Thursday\nand go out every night of the week-end. We also had to go to every lecture and practical. I don\u2019t think my\nlab partner appreciated me turning\nup and not being able to focus prop-erly. So where did we go?\nTHURSDAY\nAs this was our first night, we didn\u2019t\nwant to burn out, so we decided to\ntake it easy until we arrived.\nDid you know if you get to The\nEnd before 11.30pm drinks are\nreally cheap? When I say cheap, I\nmean ridiculously cheap \u2013 \u00a31.60 for\na house spirit and mixer. How good\nis that? We arrived at about 11.15,\nas we knew the door guy would be a\ntwat as they always are, so we only\nhad 15 minutes to drink as much as\nwe could afford from the cheap bar.\nWe ended up buying mini bottles\nof champagne. Why? I don\u2019t know,\nbut it seemed like a good idea at\nthe time.\nThe End has two rooms. One was\nhouse and the other was urban/\nR&B. This room I avoided the whole\nnight \u2013 there is something slightly\nunsavoury about all those Urbanite\npop-tangled groups. I mean, who\ncalls themselves \u2018snoop-bitching-ho\ngunna bust a cap in your ass\u2019 any-way? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what those\ncrazy kids were saying on the street.\nOr is it hood?\nAnyway, the main room started off\nwith the usual generic safe funky\nhouse to get people in the mood,\nwhich happened very quickly I\nmight add. Then, as the evening pro-gressed, it became a bit more progressive before slamming straight\nback into proper disco house with\nno warning. There were the classics which everyone who goes to\nhouse nights will know, and they\nwere the actual originals, not those\ncrappy remixes that are around at\nthe moment (I\u2019m not mentioning\nanything in particular, except that\nFreeloaders\u2019 So Much Love to Give\nis a crime and I hope they die a hor-rible, painful death).\nOk, to the crowd: When we arrived,\nwe were greeted by a group of random Orientals thrashing in front of\nthe speakers. It was quite chilled\nat that point, but they seemed like\nthey were having fun. If you don\u2019t\nlike seeing people on drugs in a club\nI wouldn\u2019t go to Discotec, but then\nagain, I would never bother going\nto a club at all but would sit at home\nwith my Horlicks and my many cats\nand then shout at the plant in the\ncorner.\nDiscotec is an attitude-free night.\nThis means that it doesn\u2019t matter\nwho you are, who you like to sleep\nwith or what drugs you like to take,\npeople aren\u2019t going to bat an eye to\nit. This provides a nice atmosphere,\ngiving the whole night a kind of fun\nand easiness.\nAs this is the case, Discotec\nattracts a range of people. It was\nabout 50:50 on the guy-to-girl ratio\nand about 70:30 gay to straight, but\nthe big homos are raging queens\nlike in GAY so it was all pretty nor-mal. Well, kind of. Oh yeah, Mike\nand I had a great time as was to be\nexpected. We met a very attractive\nlesbian who took her top off and was\ndancing around in her bra for a bit,\nwhich was nice. They also had an\nentertainer, who had this amazing\nability to dance in the highest shoes\nI\u2019ve ever seen.\nWe left at about 3am \u2013 we thought\nwe should get an early as we had a\n9am lecture.\nNeighbourhood is a great venue for\nperformances \u2013 it has a stage and\nthe balcony stretches right around\nthe top of the room giving a perfect view of the stage to everyone.\nGetting in was no problem at all,\nas we arrived within an hour of the\ndoors opening, but the place was\nalready pretty busy.\nAs we arrived, we were greeted\nwith free shots of cocktail, which\nwas nice. If you like non-vocal electro this was perfect, though I like my\nvocals in most types of music.\nThe drinks in Neighbourhood\nare unnecessarily expensive and\nthe staff don\u2019t seem as though they\nwant to be there, which is quite\nclear when you order your drink.\nWe didn\u2019t stay for a huge amount of\ntime as we had to get to Caf\u00e9 de\nParis by midnight.\nThe mixing was impeccable the\nwhole time and the crowd had an\namazing time. The whole night was\nvery gig-like, from the attitude of\nthe crowd to the way they were\ndressed. Everyone was chilled out\nand comfortable, they were there\nfor the music. When we left, the\nqueue was stretching right around\nthe building.\nMike and I arrived at Caf\u00e9 de Paris\nat about 12 midnight, only to be\ngreeted by a bouncer who was telling guys they couldn\u2019t come into\nthe club unless they were with at\nleast one girl. Luckily we snuck past\nand got in after a small amount of\nhassle from the guest list guy, who\nwas being harassed by two over-enhanced bleached bimbos.\nWe were fortunate enough to get\nan interview with the promoter of\nthe club, who gave us a tour around\nthe place and spoke to us about the\nclub and the crowd they try to pull.\nFrom the chat, the most relevant\nthing was that they are planning\nto start a student night. Not a Caf\u00e9\nde Paris style student night, but a\nproper one with cheap drinks and\nparty games.\nSomething that became very clear\nfrom the night was that people,\nmostly guys, were there to show off\nand try to make themselves out to\nbe something special. As Mike put it,\nthey had sold their personality to the\ndevil to get into the club. He wasn\u2019t\njoking. There was no-one having\na great time, just lots of pretentious wank. I wouldn\u2019t go back there\nagain if I wasn\u2019t getting in for free,\nbecause I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t pay\nto be given that much attitude on a\nnight out.\nWatching a hen party go on the pull\nwas the one source of amusement in\nthe short period of time we spent\nthere (we left at about 1.30am).\nUnfortunately, Caf\u00e9 de Paris was\nover-priced and full of tossers, with\nbad music and a bad attitude to\nmatch.\nSATURDAY\nFirst thing\u2019s first, a quick run-down\non how I felt. Having been out two\nnights already I was feeling a bit\ntired, mainly because I had to get up\nearly both days, but I was generally\nin good spirits.\nGarlands is a club in Liverpool,\nwhich isn\u2019t that difficult to get to\nwith the wonder of the Megabus \u2013 \u00a34\neach way per person. It did take five\nhours though.\nWe arrived in Liverpool at about\nfour in the afternoon. The further\nnorth we got, the darker it became.\nI knew the north was grim, but to\nactually watch the sky get darker was ridiculous. We all joke that\nthe north is cheaper than London,\nbut it\u2019s not even funny \u2013 we went\nand got two alcoholic drinks as we\narrived and they came to about \u00a33\nin total. Can you imagine doing that\nin London?\nWe spent our evening just poncing\nabout, going from bar to bar, eating\nand drinking until about nine. As we\nwere going home the next day, we\ndidn\u2019t stay anywhere and the plan\nwas to just stay awake, so when it\ncame to getting ready to go out this\nhad to be done in the toilets of a bar.\nI don\u2019t think they see such goings on\nvery often up there.\nWe headed over to Garlands at\nabout 10.30 to ensure there were no\nproblems getting in. The queue was\nbuilding up before the doors even\nopened. For those of you who don\u2019t\nknow Garlands, it is the Studio 54 of\nour time in England. Have a look at\ntheir website, www.garlandsonline.\nco.uk, and you will know what I\nmean.\nEvery week has a different theme\n\u2013 when we went it was rollers and\ntabards. Think Thora Hird from\nLast of the Summer Wine.\nGarlands is the gayest gay club\nin the world, but it attracts a huge\nstraight following. This is probably\nbecause they focus on making the\nnight an amazing experience for\neveryone rather than trying to pull\nin the big names. Yet somehow they\ndo this as well. If you like your hard\nhouse, Garlands is a great place to\ngo in Liverpool. They quite regularly\npull in the likes of Fergie and Judge\nJules, to name a couple.\nTo try to describe Garlands is one\nof the hardest things to do, I would\njust say go and see for yourself, or\nlook at some pictures \u2013 I think they\nspeak for themselves. The drinks in\nthe club are no different to a normal\nbar in London, so you won\u2019t feel like\nyou have been ripped off.\nI know this is a bit of a pants\nreview but I have just got home and,\nat the end of my weekend, am quite\nincapable of talking (see my photo at\nthe top, and no I don\u2019t sell crack).\nClubbing.

He was\nfirst arrested in December\n2003, but was released by the\nBritish authorities without\ncharge. He was rearrested\nin August 2004 and has been\nin prison awaiting extradition\never since.\nWriting for Felix in January,\nMr Ahmad said: \u201cI know, and\nGod knows, that I am not a\nterrorist and that I have not\ndone anything wrong or ille-gal. That is what matters to\nme more than what others\nthink. And I will have my day,\nfor sure, no doubt about it.\u201d\nSpeakers outside the court\nincluded Martin Mubanga and\nMoazzam Begg, both of whom\nwere imprisoned under terror\nlaws and recently released.\nMr Mubanga gave an emotional description of his time\nas a detainee at Guantanamo\nBay, adding that Mr Ahmad\ncould also finish up there if\nlawyers and governments\nmade the \u201cwrong\u201d choices.\nDr Adnan Siddiqui, a\nspokesman for \u2018Stop Political\nTerror\u2019, spent part of the day\nin court before coming outside to address Mr Ahmad\u2019s\nsupporters. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite\nharrowing listening to what\u2019s\nhappening,\u201d he said.\n\u201cButiftheyextraditehim,do\nyou think they can extradite\nall of us? No! That\u2019s the message we have to put across:\nwe will not be silenced. We\nare standing up for the truth,\nand we expect our leaders to\nstand up for the truth. But\nthey have given up on the\ntruth, so now it is time for the\npeople to take over.\u201d\nColin Smith, Imperial\nCollege Union\u2019s Welfare\nCampaigns Officer, led the\ndemonstration outside the\ncourt. He told Felix: \u201cOnce\nagain it was fantastic to see\nsuch a large demo in support\nof Babar. As we get closer to\njudgement day, it is vital that\nwe continue with the cam-paign.\n\u201cContinued resistance to\nwhat is being done to Babar\ncan\u2019t fail to have an influence\non this case, which is why\nI would encourage everyone\nto be back at Bow Street\nMagistrates Court on 17 May\nwhen the judge will rule on\nBabar\u2019s fate.\u201d\nLast Wednesday, it was\nannounced that Mr Ahmad\nwill stand as a candidate in\nthe forthcoming general elec-tion. He will represent the\nPeace and Progress Party\nin the constituency of Brent\nNorth. The party, founded by\nthe actors Vanessa and Corin\nRedgrave, focuses on human\nrights and is campaigning\nfor British troops to be withdrawn from Iraq.\nA statement from Mr\nAhmad\u2019s election agent read:\n\u201cBabar firmly believes that\ncivil rights and liberties have\nbeen sacrificed in Britain in\nan attempt to create a climate\nof fear among the population.\nVoting for Babar symbolises\nthe British public\u2019s opposition to this suspension of\ncivil rights, which millions of\nBritish men and women sacrificed their lives for over 50\nyears ago.\u201d\n\u25cf Comment, page 6\nTerror trial reaches final chapter\n\u25cf Imperial alumnus Babar Ahmad remains in custody\n\u25cf 500 people, including media and high-profile speakers, attend protest outside court\n\u25cf Ahmad stands as general election candidate in Brent North\n\u25cf Judge will give verdict on extradition on 17 May\nThe former Guantanamo Bay detainee Martin Mubanga\nspeaks up for Babar Ahmad outside court last week\nHave a slice, there\u2019s plenty to go around...\nSir Richard Sykes, the\nRector, cuts himself a slice\nof Imperial\u2019s largest ever\npizza, which was unveiled\nin the JCR at the end of\nlast term.

In retro-spect, it is possible to see\nthis geographical error as\nthe point where it all began\nto go so horribly wrong for\nWarwick.\nEventually they turned up,\nand unfortunately for our\nopponents they probably\nspent longer getting lost on\ntheir journey than playing on\nthe courts.\nSarah \u2018Speedy\u2019 Statton won\nher singles comfortably 6-2\n6-1.

Meanwhile\non court one, Warwick\u2019s\nnumber one player went\ndown 6-3 6-2. This was much\nto the disappointment of her\nteam-mates and ever watchful mother, whose hopes for\nher daughter\u2019s success were\nsavagely crushed by Emma\n\u2018The Ironfist\u2019 Marsdin.\nThe doubles were nicely\none-sided, Emma and Caryl\nwinning 8-1 followed by Sarah\nand Lucinda\u2019s 8-2 victory.\nAfter just three hours,\nwe had won the semi-final\nby completely destroying\nWarwick 10-0 overall.\nTENNIS\nImperial\u2019s women\u2019s tennis team enjoyed a comfortable 10-0 victory over Warwick in their BUSA Shield semi-final\nWomen\u2019s Head of the\nRiver\nBy Ben Anstiss\nThe Women\u2019s Head of the\nRiver Race was held on\nSaturday 4 March, running\nfrom Mortlake (near Chiswick\nBridge) to Putney Pier (near\nPutney Bridge).\nTwo hundred and forty all-female crews took part in\nthe timed race across Elite,\nSenior, Novice and Veteran\ndivisions. The event was a tie\nat the top of the board with\nLeander and a GB composite\ncrew (including an Imperial\nCollege alumnus) both clocking a time of 19 minutes 20.83\nseconds.\nImperial College Boat Club\nentered two crews, one in\nthe Senior 3 category and\none in Novice, as well as an\nadditional Imperial/Thames/\nWestminster composite crew\nin Elite (who came 71st overall in a time of 22:10.01).\nThe novice girls performed\nwell, especially considering\ntheir diminutive size, coming\n13th in the Novice category in\na time of 24:08.39.\nThe top squad ladies did\nremarkably well, coming 21st overall in a time of\n20:52.92 and fourth in Senior\n3.

    "content": "The election is coming up. Politicians\nand the media subject us to an all-out tirade of facts, figures, sound-bites and promises in order to allow\nus to make an \u2018informed decision\u2019\non 5th May. This is what democracy\nlooks like, apparently.\nThe last thing I want to do is add\nto this clamour, but I would like to\nraise a rather awkward point, which\ndoesn\u2019t get mentioned very often\non the BBC: the electoral system in\nBritain is completely undemocratic.\nIt is well understood and uncontroversial that the current \u2018first past\nthe post\u2019 electoral system favours\nthe two main parties. If in doubt,\njust consider the statistics from the\npast five general elections, shown\non the graphs to the right (source:\nUK Election Statistics, House of\nCommons research paper 03/59).\nThe contrast between the Liberal\nDemocrats\u2019 percentage of votes and\nseats in parliament is stark, and\nwhilst \u2018Other\u2019 parties have more\nthan doubled their share of the vote\nsince 1983, their number of seats has\nonly increased by about a third.\nBut even these simple statistics\ndon\u2019t tell the whole story \u2013 surely\npeople would vote differently if they\ndidn\u2019t have to enter into complex\ncalculus about whether a vote for X\nor Y might be more effective in their\nconstituency. The voter has one\nvote to decide both which candidate\nbest represents their local interests\nand which party best represents\nthe national interest. So unlike the\nUnited States where the executive is\ndirectly elected, in the UK we have\nonly an indirect say in who actually\nforms the government.\nIn my mind, this simply amounts\nto a system of divide and rule. Does\nit matter? Well, at the very core of\nwestern civilization is the proclamation that the only legitimate form of\nauthority comes from the consent\nof the people. So, I would say, yes\nit does matter, especially at a time\nwhen we are exporting our superior values of democracy all over\nthe world.\nSo, other than choosing to forget\nthis inconvenient little flaw, what\ncan we do? Well, what I am getting at, of course, is the need for\nelectoral reform. In the long run, I\nthink that a coalition between the\nprogressive smaller parties and the\nLiberal Democrats is the best way\nto challenge the present two-party\ndictatorship. They would only have\nto win one election to implement a\nsystem of proportional representa-tion, and could then return to their\nseparate camps knowing that their\nsupporters would be fairly represented in parliament in the future.\nIn the short term, if you are not\nhappy with either Labour or the\nConservatives, then I think there is\na way that you can have an impact at\nthis general election \u2013 by tactical vot-ing. This is where large numbers of\npeople organise themselves outside\nthe influences of the mainstream\nmedia and politicians. It is important\nthat this be a co-ordinated effort if it\nis to be effective, so the internet is\nthe perfect tool. There are numerous websites you can find which\noutline such strategies. I personally\nlike www.strategicvoter.co.uk.\nNoam Chomsky describes the\nelectoral process as an exercise in\nmarginalizing the public, that is:\n\u201cReducing them to apathy and obe-dience, allowing them to participate\nin the political system, but as con-sumers, not as true participants.\nYou allow them a method for ratifying decisions that are made by oth-ers, but you eliminate the methods\nby which they might first, inform\nthemselves; second, organize; and\nthird, act in such a way as to really\ncontrol decision-making.\u201d\nWe can accept this if we want to,\nbut that is a choice we are all free\nto make.\n\u25cf Andrew Ireson is a PhD\nstudent in the civil\nengineering department\nAn election strategy for the dispossessed\nAs the country prepares to go to the polls, Andrew Ireson argues for electoral reform\nLetters to\nthe Editor\nTanaka trouble\ninterrupts revision\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to you rather than studying for my finals as my preferred\nplace of study has been rendered\nunusable by persons unknown...\nWorking in the Mechanical\nEngineering reading room this\nafternoon, my productivity was\nseverely hampered by an almost\ncontinuous stream of clattering\nand banging as a small army of\ncaterers set about transforming the\nTanaka building entrance hall into\nsome sort of Japanese themed dinning room.

    "content": "Preamble\nTo many people, 18 March\n2005 was a significant date.\nIt signified the end of term\nand a time to celebrate and\npass out on a seedy London\nstreet due to excessive alcohol consumption. But for the\nImperial College Ultimate\nFrisbee team, the Disc\nDoctors, it marked the start\nof the South East Student\nOutdoor Regionals.\nNow for a little background.\nThere are two main student\nevents on the Disc Doctors\u2019\nultimate calendar: South East\nIndoor Regionals and South\nEast Outdoor Regionals.\nQualifying in the top three\nfor both would put the team\ninto the national indoor and\noutdoor event.\nUnfortunately the team\ndidn\u2019t qualify for the indoor\nnationals this year. We like\nto blame it on the fact that\nwe haven\u2019t played as much\nindoors as we have out-doors! So South East Student\nOutdoor Regionals was to be\nthe big one.\nThe Disc Doctors (dD) had\nbeen training hard in Hyde\nPark every Wednesday and\nSaturday in sub-zero temper-atures, and even snow, building up to this tournament.\nSo, as the guys got aboard\nthe train to Royal Holloway\nready for a weekend of \u201cdisc\naction\u201d, it was hard to predict\nwhat would come next.\nThe \u2018Ultimate mini book of\nmumbo jumbo frisbee jargon\u2019\n(see grey panel, right) may be\nuseful in reading the reports\nthat follow!\ndD1 MATCH REPORTS\ndD1 13\nSublime2 (Portsmouth) 0\nOur first game is never our\nbest, so the first team were\nrelieved to find we didn\u2019t have\na crunch match to start the\nday.\nWe soon gained a comfortable lead after forcing\nSublime\u2019s handlers to make\nsome tricky throws under the\npressure of our junk zone.\nSublime\u2019s handlers were\nlearning, towards the end,\nhow to get around our junk,\nand use hammers to get over\nour wall. Nathan has asked\nme to say that he played\nsuperbly in this game.\ndD1 8\nUCLSE (London) 5\nUCL and LSE didn\u2019t have\nenough players to form two\nseparate teams, so they were\nallowed to combine to form\nthe considerably stronger\n\u2018UCLSE\u2019.\nWe managed gain a bit of\na lead at the start, thanks\nto some good play from,\namongst others, our new rising star Sui.\nThings started looking\nvery unsettling when UCLSE\nmanaged to take advantage\nof dD\u2019s unusually weak deep\nmarking. They took advantage of several turnovers by\nusing quick hucks and some\nzippy receivers. Our opponents levelled the game at\n5-5, but dD managed to cut\ndown on the throwaways and\neventually win.\ndD1 13\nAye Aye2 (Norwich) 0\nAye Aye 2, from the University\nof East Anglia, were short on\nnumbers, and the effect of\nthe earlier games in the gorgeous weather showed from\nthe beginning.\nTowards the end, Aye\nAye2, realising all was lost,\npulled out a play called the\n\u2018Braveheart\u2019. This play\ninvolved Aye Aye waiting in\ntheir zone and then charging\ndown dD with cries of \u201cfreedom!\u201d when we approached,\nto scare us or simply surprise\nus and make us laugh uncon-trollably.\nThe tactic worked, Aye\nAye got the disc and almost\nscored. We struck back with\nthe \u2018cup-o-saurus\u2019 play.\ndD1 10\nBrunel (London) 5\nThis game was the first of\nwhat was to be a series of\nstunning dD1 performances\nover the weekend. dD1 rose\nto the challenge of playing,\narguably, the best team in the\nSouth East this year. I cannot\nbegin to tell you all the notable performances that were\npart of the best team play I\u2019ve\nseen from Imperial in 2004-5.\nBrunel were without their\nmain man Malcolm on the\nday, so dD took advantage of\ntheir lack of handling depth.\nBrunel\u2019s Dan tried his hardest but their deep threat\nwas neutralised by a combination of K-man, Stylish,\nand the good luck invoked\nby Jay deciding to ditch his\ntracksuit bottoms and wear\nshorts, thereby allowing our\nhandlers to work their way up\nthe pitch.\nThere were tense moments\ntowards the end when Brunel\nmanaged to claw back several points, but our early lead,\nand resurgence in the last ten\nminutes, sealed a very satisfying victory.\ndD1 10\nStrange Blue1\n(Cambridge) 12\nThis game was, in some\nsenses, the most exciting\nand most disappointing of the\nweekend. Lewis had joined\nus for the day, we were on\na high from the day before,\nand thanks to three-pint-chal-lenge-free party the night\nbefore, none of us were feeling rough.\nThis game showed that dD\nhad great potential, but far too\nmany drops and throwaways\nwere made. Our junk zone\nwasn\u2019t working very well, but\na transition to the \u2018brownie\nzone\u2019 caused an impressive\ndD fightback which was,\nunfortunately, too late.\nHighlights included a\nhuck from Lewis, which a\nCambridge player blocked\nbut didn\u2019t catch. K-man neatly\ncaught the still-flying disc,\nand then threw to Steve-O for\na stunning point. K-man also\nscored the first ever Callahan\nPoint of the tournament, a\nfirst for dD, and even Magic\nmanaged to score.\ndD1 10\nSublime1 (Portsmouth) 5\nLast year we got utterly\nspanked by Sublime. We\nhonestly didn\u2019t know what to\nexpect this time round, especially with ex-Sublime player\nLewis now on our side.\nIt was a pretty charged,\nphysical game.

This policy was finally\napproved on 22 February and is now\nin place to guide staff and contractors towards achieving a \u2018showcase\nlow carbon heritage estate\u2019.\nThis is cause for celebration, I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ll agree, considering the\nbattle that has been fought by the\nCollege\u2019s Energy Manager to have\nit implemented. The College should\nbe applauded for having dragged\nitself up to speed with the country\u2019s\nother universities, but as students\nwe must remain vigilant to ensure\nthat the measures are implemented\nas promised.\nImperial\u2019s Energy Management\nPolicy makes the ambitious and welcome statement that the College\n\u201caims to become the leading UK\nacademic institution in applied\nenergy efficiency and utility management\u201d. However, the published\npolicy consists only of four bullet\npoints indicating the areas in which\nimprovements will be made. No\ndetailed blueprints for the essential changes are included, though\nthe policy does refer to a separate Energy Management Strategy,\nwhich is sadly not provided.\nThankfully the key areas of concern\nare mentioned in the brief text, with\nenergy efficiency of new buildings,\nprocurement and energy awareness\nall receiving attention.\nFrom the publication of what is\nconsidered a \u201cbold and ambitious\nstatement\u201d, it appears that the\nCollege is now committed to pursuing good environmental steward-ship. But if this is really the case\nthen why not publish the agreements and targets that underpin\nmeeting the objectives? In this\nrespect, Imperial still lags behind\nits counterparts.\nUK universities currently spend\n\u00a3200m on energy requirements.\nThis vast sum has prompted the\nHigher Education Funding Council\nfor England (HEFCE), to promote\nbetter energy management practices through the Green Gown\nawards.\nOn 22 March, the University of\nGlasgow was named the most energy efficient higher education institution in Britain for an innovative\nlighting system. Thirteen universities received awards or were com-mended, three of these for energy\nefficiency. Unsurprisingly, Imperial\nCollege did not appear amongst\nthose commended in 2005, but what\nis perhaps more telling is information that appears on the websites\nof some other institutions that also\nmissed out. Whilst Imperial is far\nfrom alone in having high aspirations for energy efficiency, its lack of\nexplicit targets seems to distinguish\nit from the majority.\nFor example, Oxford intends to\nreduce total carbon emissions by\n20% from 1990 levels by 2010 by using\nmore renewables. It is also monitoring CO2\nreductions by measuring\nkgC per m2\nof floor space. Bristol\nUniversity has allocated \u00a360,000 to\nidentifying energy-saving initiatives\nand boasts that it has begun carbon\ntrading through the EU emissions\ntrading scheme. Cambridge is even\nprepared to publish a breakdown of\nenergy costs alongside a detailed\nenergy policy that aims to reduce\nenergy consumption by 5% over five\nyears.\nUltimately, adoption of an energy\npolicy at Imperial is cause for cel-ebration, as inefficient energy use\ncampus-wide can now be held to\naccount. The next step is to make\nit clear to the Rector and to the\nCollege that students, staff and the\npublic deserve to see the full strat-egy. If Imperial is to successfully\nreduce its environmental impact\nthrough its actions as well as its\nresearch, then clear targets must\nbe met.\nSo let us now see if the published\nenergy policy can be increased to\nat least match Manchester\u2019s four-page document. And let us ensure\nthat the Environmental Policy, due\nin 2005, is sufficient to put Imperial\nin line for some Green Gowns in the\ncoming years.\n\u25cf Simon Bennett is an MSc\nstudent of environmental\ntechnology\nIMPERIAL\u2019S ENERGY MANAGEMENT POLICY\n\u201cImperial College London is a world-class teaching and research institution providing\nscientific and technical excellence, innovation and solutions for the global needs of the\n21st Century. Best practice in energy management will become increasingly important\nin support of this position.\nThe College aims to become the leading UK academic institution in applied energy efficiency and utility\nmanagement, demonstrating sound environmental governance and global citizenship, and providing a\nshowcase low carbon heritage estate.\nThis will be achieved by:\n\u2022 Energy management including the implementation of an Energy Management Strategy, clearly defined\nobjectives, targets, responsibilities and operating principles, and the efficient management of energy in the\nestate;\n\u2022 Energy efficient design including Energy Standards, Monitoring and Targeting systems, continuous\nimprovement of the estate and best practice in new buildings;\n\u2022 People solutions including the development of a culture of energy awareness and accountability; and\n\u2022 Procurement, which integrates low/renewable energy and carbon reduction into decisions regarding energy\npurchasing and generation and the purchase of equipment and materials.\nThe Energy Management Strategy will be reviewed and updated annually.\nEnergy Management at the College is the responsibility of the Director of Estates. Faculty Heads, with the\nsupport of their Faculty Administrative Officers and the Estates Energy Manager, are responsible for identifying\nand implementing agreed priorities within their Departments/Divisions. The efficient use of energy is the\nresponsibility of all staff and students.\u201d\n\u25cf If you have any comments or suggestions about energy issues at the College, you can contact the Estates\nEnergy Manager, Phil Evans, on 020 7594 9652 or phil.evans@ic.ac.uk.\nMaking poverty history\n\u201cSometimes it falls upon a generation to be great. You can be that\ngreat generation. Let your greatness blossom. Of course the task\nwill not be easy. But not to do this\nwould be a crime against human-ity, against which I ask all humanity now to rise up.\u201d\nThose were the words of Nelson\nMandela addressing 40,000 people\nat a Make Poverty History rally\nin Trafalgar Square on Friday 4\nFebruary 2005.\nFor those of you who weren\u2019t\nin Trafalgar Square, or around\nParliament Square the other night\nwhen 11,000 turned up for a candlelit\nvigil in Westminster Abbey and midnight march down Whitehall, and\nwho haven\u2019t been reading the papers\nor watching the news, I\u2019ll start with a\nbrief introduction...\nMake Poverty History is a massive campaign, launched this year\nand backed by over 400 charities,\nnon-governmental organisations,\nfaith groups, activist networks, trade\nunions and celebrities. The basis\nof the campaign, and Mandela\u2019s\nemphasis on our generation, is that\ntoday we live in a world that has the\nresources and potential to lift the\nentire population of the planet out of\npoverty. And yet, we live in a world\nwhere poverty causes the deaths\nof 30,000 children each day; a world\nwhere 38m people live with HIV; and\na world where the gap between rich\nand poor is wider than ever before,\nand increasing by the day.\nThe causes of these global inequalities are not, however, natural. They\nlie in the corruption and self-interest\nof the world\u2019s major powers, which\nin turn result in a glaringly unjust\nglobal trade system and the huge\nburden of third-world debt that contrasts with pitiful aid donations. This\nwas highlighted in the wake of the\ntsunami crisis that struck south-east\nAsia on 26 December last year, when\nthe total sum of money donated to\nthe relief effort by the British government amounted to less than one\nweek\u2019s spending on the Iraq war.\nAn example closer to home that\ndraws some of these points together\nnicely is that of our beloved Rector,\nSir Richard Sykes. As chair of Glaxo\nWellcome in 1999, he earned, in a\ncombination of salary and bonuses,\nover \u00a33.5m. At the same time, he\nwas in the courts trying to pass laws\nto stop people in the third world\nreceiving cheaper AIDS drugs, in\nwhat Oxfam described as \u201can undeclared war against the world\u2019s poorest countries\u201d.\nSo now, the aforementioned organisations have come together to challenge global poverty under the name\nof Make Poverty History, with three\ncentral demands: the dropping of all\nthird world debt, trade justice, and\nmore and better aid. This year was\nchosen to launch the campaign for\ntwo reasons. First, in July, the G8\n(the meeting of world\u2019s eight richest and most powerful leaders) will\nbe held in Gleneagles in Scotland,\nand second, Britain will hold the\nEuropean Union presidency for the\nsecond part of the year.\nThe central focus of the campaign\nis a massive demonstration that will\nbe held in Edinburgh on Saturday\n2 July, while the G8 leaders meet\nnearby. People are already talking\nabout over a quarter of a million people demonstrating. The basic idea is\nsimple: to make it clear that people\nfrom all across Europe who will join\nthe demonstration don\u2019t just want\nworld leaders to pay lip-service to\nglobal poverty... they want them to\nend it.\nIn the run-up to the general elec-tion, each major party is trying to\ntrump the others in championing\nthe cause of the world\u2019s poor. But\nfrom past experience, particularly\nof meetings of the G8, there is little\ntalk and even less action on issues\nthat aren\u2019t about strengthening the\npositions of the eight participant\ncountries, usually to the detriment\nof everyone else. And this is why it is\nvital that as many of us as possible\nare up in Scotland on 2 July, to make\nsure that global inequality is on the\nglobal agenda, whether Bush, Blair\nand company like it or not.\nAll of this is why the Make Poverty\nHistory campaign has just been\nlaunched here at Imperial too. It is\nhoped that the breadth of support\nnationally will be mirrored within\nthe college, and the response so\nfar from clubs and societies, faith\ngroups and individuals has been\nimpressive. A large rally is currently\nbeing organised for the third week\nof term, but before then, there are\ntwo things you can do if you want to\nget involved:\n\u25cf A motion is being taken to Union\nCouncil, which will next meet on\nThursday 12 May, to obtain official backing for the Make Poverty\nHistory campaign at Imperial. To\nshow the breadth of support, as\nmany people as possible need to\nsecond this motion, which can be\nviewed alongside this article at www.\nfelixonline.co.uk. If you wish to join\nthe list of seconders, please email\nme with your name, department and\nyear at cs602@ic.ac.uk.\n\u25cf Come along to the first Make\nPoverty History organisers\u2019 meeting at 1pm on Monday 2 May in the\ncafeteria area inside the entrance to\nthe SAF (medics\u2019 building at South\nKensington).\nAnd remember, as Nelson Mandela\nhighlighted, that it would be a crime\nnot to speak out against the inequality that exists today in our world.\nOur government has the means to\nvastly change this situation, but as\nwe have seen before, this won\u2019t happen without pressure from below,\npressure from us in our hundreds of\nthousands marching in Edinburgh\nin July.\nFinally, if it seems like a daunting\ntask, then remember the phrase:\n\u201cThey are G8... we are six billion.\u201d\n\u25cf Numaan Chaudhry looks\nat making poverty history in\nthis week\u2019s Business section,\npage 4\nCOLIN SMITH\nWELFARE CAMPAIGNS\nOFFICER\n\n"
