Council Report\nThe 195th IC Union Council meeting chaired\nby Pete Teague, began just before 6.00pm on\nMonday.\nThere was no major news. Mr Downs had\nreceived a letter from Mr Mohindra, Chairman\nof the Overseas Students Committee, tendering\nhis resignation due to personal circumstances.\nThe President's report included news on\nhalls and refectories. The advice to\nstudents to eat elsewhere appears to have\nbeen heeded, judging by Mr Mooney's quote:\n\"Refectories have never been this empty at\nthis time before\". As regards halls, the\nrent will be reviewed and put to the Governors at a meeting on Dec. 18th, to be\nimplemented after Christmas. However,.,\nobjections were raised over having mid session al price increases, whereas grants\nare reviewed only annually.\nThere was also discussion as to how many\nobservers to send to future NUS conferences,\nas it is normally three, but the cost per\nhead is \u00a335.\nICWA: The FLATSHARE scheme run in the\nlast two weeks of the vacation proved to be\na great success, with not only female\nstudents being catered for as was the\noriginal idea. The problem of residence\nthis year was aggravated by the fact that\nthe Residence Officer failed his exams and\nconsequently the position was left vacant.\nIt is hoped that the scheme will be run next\nyear on a larger scale.\nIn AOB, Mr Abraham, acting PGAO, proposed\nthat writing-up students (PG's staying on\nafter their time for about three months to\nfinish writing their theses) should be given\nthe status of registered students for the\npurpose of using Union facilities. This was\naccepted.\nThe most noteworthy fact about this meeting was that the meeting had only taken\ntwo hours and forty minutes- the shortest\nCouncil meeting ever held in IC.\n\n"

He said that since 1967\nthere had been a200% increase in the staff's wages, while prices had gone up by only 98%.\nWhen asked to comment on the charge of poor\nfood quality, he replied that this was a subjective matter, and opinions of what\ntastes good vary from one person to another.\nHe said he would welcome the enquiry which\nwas demanded at the last Union meeting. He\nadded that the last three enquiries had given\nthe refectories a clean bill of health.\nPeter Teague, however, in replying on\nbehalf of the Union, said that while it is possible that the refectories might be\nfavourably reviewed by an enquiry, the last one had been more than fj ve years ago, and\nconditions may have changed since then.\nIC RUGBY CLUB SWEEPSTAKE Following the success of last year's sweepstake,\nthis venture will be continued, to finance an Easter\ntour.

It is hoped that these movements\ntogether with NUS will be able to exert\nsufficient pressure on the government to\ndirect it away from public expenditure cuts.\nIt is also the intention of NUS to give the\nissues as much publicity as possible and try\nto engender a response from the general\npublic. To this end, and also to educate\nthe NUS membership to the full consequences\nof the cuts, weeks of action are being\norganised between 27th October and 7th November. This may include some form of\nnational demonstration. The first major\nevent taking place on the cuts issue is the\n\"Save Education\" Rally, March, and Lobby of\nParliament on 21st October. This has been\norganised by the South East Regional Council\nof the TUC. The assembly point is at\n\"Reformers' Tree\" near Speakers Corner at\n2pm. The rally will move off at 2.45pm. This demonstration is followed in the evening\nby a\" Rally for Education\" organised by the\nCouncil for Educational Advance in the\nCentral Hall Westminster from 7pm. till9 pm. No tickets are required just turn up.\nFurther details on both of these are avail able from me in the Union Office. Conclusion\nThe Education Cuts issue is one that should\nbe of interest to us all.

The elections\nfor a large number of Union posts will take\nplace, and if you're at all interested in helping the Union this year, have a look at\nthe notice board in the Union Lower Lounge,\nand see which posts are up for election. Also, the UGM will see the re-emergence of the\nUnion Policy Statement. This document should\nhave been presented at the AGM last year, but\nit was missed out. For the benefit of\nFreshers, this document is a chronicle of all Union Policies from 1962. It is especially useful at NUS Conference, etc, for delegates\nto use as guidelines when voting. Copies are\navailable from the Union Office. At the\nmeeting you will be asked to accept it as a true record of Union Policy at the present\ntime. If you disagree with the contents, then\npresent a motion to a UGM to change it. Hall Insurance\nThe present policy covers theft by any me ens, acts of God, etc in all College Halls, Houses,\nand Flats. It only covers belongings in your\nroom. If you want additional cover, say for\na calculator which you carry with you, go\ndown to Endsleigh on Old Brompton Road, and\nget an \" All Risks\" quotation.\nParking\nThe committee has met, and allocated places.\nIf you haven't collected your permit yet do\nso today, as the appeals committee meets\nnext week to allocate the remaining spaces.\nNUS Mail Order\nA new NUS Service has started; a mail order\ncompany.

FREE: IC student assaulted\nby gang of thugs\nA member of the Imperial College Dramatic\nSociety was brutally assaulted by a gang of\nfour youths during the early hours of last\nSunday morning. The incident took place\nopposite Gloucester Road tube station as the\nstudent was making his way back to Evelyn\nGardens.\nPushed against barrier\nThe student, who had been working late designing sets for Dramsoc's Christmas\nproduction; 'The Captain of Kopenick', was\ndeliberately pushed against the pedestrian\nbarriers. He picked himself up after crashing\nto the ground and muttered something to the\nyouths as he walked away.\nBeaten severely\nTwo of the youths, who were still within ear-shot, then chased him and caught him. They\nthen proceeded to beat him severely about the\nface and body. He was kicked several times\nin the ribs and stomach.\nYouths challenged\nEight foreign young men who happened to be\npassing by challenged the youths who promptly\nran off in the direction of Cromwell Road.\nFive of them gave chase, but lost the gang\nat the junction of Gloucester Road and\nCromwell Road.\nPolice called\nThe IC student, who by this time was bleeding\nquite heavily from the nose and mouth, then\nmade his way back to the Union Building. He\nwas met by Riz Shakir, ICU Deputy President,\nwho had just returned from a late excursion.\nThe police were called and the student taken\nto hospital for an X ray and treatment of his bruises. Case dropped\nThe police who have been investigating the\ncase have now dropped it. This is due to the\nfact that they have not got a good enough\ndescription of the youths and thus cannot put\nout a 'wanted' notice for them. The student\ninvolved has decided not to prefer charges\nafter meeting with police officers yesterday\nto discuss the matter.\nW2 burgled\nTwenty-seven calculators, which were chained\nto desks in room 215 of the new Huxley\nBuildings, were stolen last Friday evening.\nThe calculators are made by Advance Electronics Ltd. and are of the Executive 16/R range. Their total value has been put at\n\u00a33,039.\nThe calculators, which are bigger than the\nHewlett-Packard 45, were discovered missing\nat 10.45pm. by a security guard who was doing\nhis rounds. The doors to room 215 had been\nforced and the chains securing the calculators to the desks had been cut.\nThat the burglary took place between 7.00pm. and 11.00pm. is certain because the security guard who discovered the theft had checked\nand locked the door to room 215 at 7.00pm. It seems obvious from the mode of entry\nthat the burglar or burglars knew the\nbuilding fairly well and the burglary itself would have taken no more than five to ten\nminutes.\nContinued on page 5\n\n"

    "content": "FELICITY3 Education Cuts-the way to cure inflation?\nby Peter league, ICU President\nThe History of Education Cuts\nThe present Education Cuts must be seen in, the context of the overall Public expenditure\ncuts, as one of the main government tactics for dealing with the high rate of inflation. Firstly much of the public expenditure is\nnon-productive and does not generate consumption, and secondly it is often financed on\ncredit which of itself is inflationary. The present series of cuts began in1973, reducing current spending by 10% and capital programmes by 20%. As a result many educational institutions had less money to spend\nin197475 than in197374, despite large\nincreases in the cost of equipment etc. In\nthe Budget presented by Denis Healey in April1975 a further \u00a386 million was lopped off the\nexpenditure on education, arts, science and\nlibraries. Since then the Chancellor has\nrevealed that he plans to cut a further \u00a31250\nmillion from Public Spending. According to\nthe \"Times Higher Education Supplement\", this would entail cuts of \u00a3500 million in education spending, spread over the next four year*.\nThis will mean that education spending will only increase by 1.6% this year, and will actually decrease by 1.3% next year. Remember\nthat with about 25% inflation this means that\nthe real value of the money spent on education will fall by 23.4% this year, and 26.3%\nnext year, if the rate of inflation is sustained .\nThe effects of the cuts\nThe form which the education cuts take varies considerably from area to area as the implementation of the cuts is largely a matter for\ndecision by Local Authorities. The following\nare some examples:\n* Teacher Training supply targets cut by\n54,000 places.\n* Closure of 13 Colleges of Education.\n* Reduction in the number and value of\ndiscretionary awards, eg Some authorities are not issuing any more discretionary awards.\n* Shelving of plans to replace school and\ncollege buildings.* Cuts in effective grants to Universities.* Plans to employ less than their quota of\nteachers in some 20 local authorities, hence increasing the size of school classes\n* A complete standstill in the provision of\nNursery Education, despite the fact that we\nhave the worst provision in Europe.\nAs you can see from the items listed above\nwhich do not cover all those things being cut\nthis amounts to a direct attack on the\nstandard of education that we have at present\nShould Education Be Cut ?\nEducational spending is a particularly easy field to cut since the cuts\nin spending produce no drastic results immediately, as cuts in say the health service\nwould. Cuts in the Education Services are a particularly short - sighted way of attempting to solve an economic crisis. They necessarily involve a diminution of future prospects\nfor economic growth. When the economy begins\nto get on the move again we will need educated\npeople at all levels to man the economy. These\npeople will not be available if we continue to\ncut spending on education as we are cutting both the numbers of people that can be e ducat ed, and also the level of education.\nIt is easy to condemn cuts in education spending and provide no alternative philosophy.\nCuts in other areas of public ed p end it ure are\nfavoured in some quarters. The National\nUnion of Students subscribe to the lobby which\nfavours increased public spending, lower un-employment, free collective bargaining, and\nimport controls, as the solution to our pre sent economic crisis. I do not wholeheartedly\nsubscribe to this view.\nWhat relevance to IC?\nHaving read this you may be asking what\nrelevance do the cuts in education spending\nhave to I.C.? The effects in any one college\nare difficult to item is e. College has not\nreceived as much money as expected from the\ngovernment, and because of this the departments and administration were subject to two\nseparate cuts each of two per cent. This\nmoney has to be saved somehow. In the\nadministration appointments of replacement\nstaff are being ' frozen' where ever possible.\nThis means either a heavier burden on the\nremaining staff complement, or that work\nbecomes delayed. In the departments a large\nproportion of expenditure is also committed\nto salaries and the areas easiest to cut are\ndemonstrating and the allocation for hospitality ie. the social side of the department.\nThus far the College has managed to bear\nthe cuts exceedingly well due to considerable\nhard work in financial planning and strategy.\nHow much longer this can continue is a question of pure conjecture.\nThe National Campaign.\nOne of the central points of the campaign\norganised by NUS is to ally with the Labour\nand Trade Union movements. These groups are\nboth very powerful and as the cuts affect\nevery person who is in education, or who has\nContinued on page 4\n\n"

    "content": "FELICITY\nRCSU Skin-diver\narrested!\nLast Saturday, during their rag collection, one member of RCS was picked-up by a police man. Besides this incident, the collection was fairly peaceful with a few tourists taking pot shots at the multitude of umbrellas .\nThe rank and file of RCS started their outing with a Kangala and proceeded to wake-up Southside. After arriving at the Harrods\narea, the crowd spread out and in no time all exits from Harrods were covered. As usual,\nthe scrooges were out in force, so collecting was not too easy. The weather did not help\neither; by 11.30am most collectors were half frozen. There was competition too, as the\ncollectors from the mentally disabled group\ncame to town as well, which sort of saturated\nthe area. However, when people tried the\nBritish Heart Foundation approach as opposed\nto the Underwater B roll y Con, they received\ndonations of up to 50p! One tourist, obviously annoyed at the collection, decided to take\nit out on the poor defenseless umbrellas, at\nleast one umbrella was slightly bent after wards .\nBy 12 noon, most people had decided to\ncall it a day. Most; but not one David\nRawnsley, who ventured up to Oxford Street\nin his wet-suit and proceeded to collect from the ones who donated so kindly a fort night ago. While he was persuading a few\npersons at a bus-stop near Marble Arch, he\nwas picked-up by a plainclothes policeman.\nThis was at about 12.50pm. The policeman told Mr Rwansley that he was\nobstructing the Queen's highway and took his\ncollecting can away from him. In doing so.\nthe label blew-off the can while in the\npoliceman's hand. He was then taken to the\npolice station where he was told that he\ncould be charged with obstruction, not having\nthe label on his collecting can firmly affixed and not having a proper licence (the\nlicence he held was a house-to-house one as\nopposed to a street one).\nAfter being held for an hour, he was told that the charge of obstruction had been\ndropped. He was not charged with either of\nthe remaining two offences. However, the\npolice said that they would check with the\nRCSU on the labels and the licenses.

Also, I would like to thank Pat, the\nUnion typist, for her help in typing material\nfor this issue.\nEducation Cuts\nNext Tuesday sees the first major action to\noppose the Public Expenditure cuts which the\ngovernment has implemented as part of its measures to curb inflation. The Education\nsector, being an easy target, has borne the\nbrunt of these cuts in public spending and in the short term, many people might think this\nto be a good move. However, in the long\nterm, when hopefully the economy will have\nrevived, there is no guarantee that these\ncuts will be restored and an increase in education spending will take place.\nOn the contrary, we are faced with further\ngovernment proposals to slash another \u00a3500\nmillion over the next four years from the\neducational budget. The form the cuts have\ntaken are outlined in the President's article devoted to this very crucial topic. These\ninclude a50% reduction in new building programmes for universities. This has an\nimmediate local consequence for every student\nin this College. It means that the College\ndoes not have the money to build new halls of\nresidence or to provide alternative ac como da>ti on for IC students.\nThis example illustrates the need for\nevery student at IC to fully understand the\nnature and implications of the government's policy as regards education, not only at a local level, but at a national level. It is therefore up to you to begin to question\nthese abortive steps which in the long run\ncan only lead to a massive lowering of\neducational standards.\nThus I would urge you to attend the rally and lobby of Parliament on Tuesday, 21st Oct.\nIt may not be the best way to pursue the\nfight against the cuts, but it is one way and\nonly by your participation can a better and\nmore meaningful resistance be built up. This is open in Room at the Top, at the top\nof the Union Building every lunch-time bet we a i12.30 and 1.30pm.( Mon-Fri)\nIf you have any problems or would like to\nhave a chat with someone please do not\nhesitate to come up to the Centre.\nCOPY DEADLINE\nIS MONDAY\nAT 2.00PM "
