    "content": "Music\nEssentially\na live sport\nRory Gallagher: The Story So Far\nTHERE ARE at present two albums on\nrelease by Polydor featuring complications\nfrom previous albums by Rory Gallagher. One is originally titled \" RORY GALLAGHER\" in the \" SPECIAL\" series\nand one called\" THE STORY SO FAR\". Having listened to the latter I decided\nthat his style of music is loud and\nexciting (as opposed to the tedium of\nSabbath's excessive volume).\nThe sleeve notes claim that he has\nestablished himself as one of the\nworld's top blues artists, this I do not\ndoubt if the tracks on this album are\nrepresentative of his general quality.\nThe album conveys the atmosphere of a live concert into my small room, no\nlittle feat considering my system, and\nsince blues is essentially a live sport,\nThis album succeeds where others have\nfailed. Flappers Unite!\nBUDGIE'S latest assault on the central\nnervous system has the amazing title of\n\"If I were Briltania I'd waive the Rules,\"\nA precisely produced album designed to\ninflict brain damage on all within fifty\nyards of the speakers. This effect, of\ncourse, is only obtained with the volume\non full, but who would dream of playing\nBudgie quietly??? Burke Shelley' s vocals have now lost their \" plant like\" qualities, and the incessant beat no\nlonger sounds like a Sabbath reject \u2014\nthey are now starring in their own right.\nAs always they have the Budgie\nsubtle bit, two tracks: one called \"Heaven\nKnows Our Name\" and one called \"Black Velvet Stallion\". Both are\nexcellent pieces showing more imagination than the other tracks. Budgie are\ndefinitely progressing and show even\ngreater promise for the future...Love to\nall the little fishes! GNOME FELIX Published by the Editor on\nbehalf of I.C. Union Publication\nBoard, printed Off-set Litho\non the premises.\nFelix Office,PrinceConsort Rd,\nLondon SW7 2BB Tel.015895111 ext 1048,1042\n\u00a9 FELIX,1976 EDITOR: Paul Ekpenyong\nMany thanks to Gill McConway,\nIan Morse, Phil Dean, Duncan\nSuss, Dave Knights, Dave\nHopkins, Terry Westoby, Dave\nFoxall, John McCloskey and\nClive Dewey.\nTranscended with vitality-Jazz-rock barrier\nShamal - Gong\nSHORT OF THE one small symbol inside\nthe cover, Gong have now left the\nconcepts of the \"Planet Gong\" far\nbehind. They have also replaced three\u00bb\ninventive musicians with one violinist, a change in musical direction that seemed\nto spell disaster, but which has, instead\nof destroying them, sent them into yet\nunheard of realms of creativity.\nAlthough two of the tracks still feature Steve Hill age and Miquette\nGiraudy, the change in style is obvious\nTheatre\nand eminently pleasing. The most notable\ntrack \" Bamboo ji\" features Hill age and\nextensive flute work by Didier Malherbe\nand sounds like a Himalayan shepherds\nlove song. The percussion, as usual, has a large part to play in the album,\nranging from bells to vibes and gongs.\nIn general, Gong seem to be transcending the Jazz Rock barrier with new\nvitality, the only disappointment being\nthat Howlett's voice is not as forceful 1\nnor distinctive as Daevid Allen's or\nSteve Hill age's. D APPLETON Theatre round-up\nOF THE TWENTY odd plays that I have\nseen in the past eight months in London,\nfifteen are still running and can be seen\nwhilst you are recovering from your exams\nduring the next fortnight. Convalescence from exam in it is is, of course, not\ncompulsory for the enjoyment of live\ntheatre, and I will certainly continue to\nreport on the theatre in any editions of\nFELIX published through the summer.\nFirstly there is the National Theatre\non the South Bank. If you can bare to\nqueue early in the morning the box office\nopens at 8.30am to sell seats at \u00a31 or\n50p for that day's performances. The\nplays in the current repertoire are a pretty\nmixed bunch. Hamlet is fairly tedious -Albert Finney is twenty years too old and\nthe production is far too long. The\nPlayboy of the Western World is great\nfun \u2014 full of enthusiasm and a great\npleasure to watch. Plunder is another\njoy to see. Dinsdale Landen plays the\ndelightful silly as s part with perfect\ntiming. Watch It Come Down is the new\nOsborne play, if you like to see married\ncouples tearing each other to bits then\nthis is the play for you (alternatively you\ncould try sitting in front of a television).\nAt the Albery, the National's production of Peter Shaffer's Equus is a must. Colin Blake ly gives a compelling\nperformance as the child psychiatrist\ntrying to come to terms with his marriage\nwhilst treating a juvenile deli que nt who\nhas committed a particularly unpleasant\ncrime. This is a very well constructed\nplay and is well worth a visit. Another\nvery theatrical play is Athol Fugard's Dimetos at the Comedy. The pleasure of\nhearing Paul Scofield speaking such\npoetic lines is immense. Those of you\nwhose interests lie in the field of levers\nand pulleys might be pleasantly surprised\nby Mr Sco field's exposition on the\nsubject.\n(Tom Stoppard's Dirty Linen (which\nopens at the Arts Theatre Club on June\n16th) is a glorious romp around a committee room of the House of Commons\n\u2014 compulsory viewing fa all stoppard\nfans. Otherwise Engaged is still at the\nQueen's although Alan Bates has left\nthe part created for him by Simon Gray. If\nyou know what it is like to be unable\nto play a new LP as a succession of\nfriends drop round for coffee you might\nenjoy this.\nWhen it comes to Mike Stott's Funny\nPeculiar at the Garrick, I am lost for\nwords. Clever though the play is, I found\nit unnecessarily crude though most of the\naudience seemed to be having the\nfunniest time of their lives. Joan\nPlowright is still in the latest Ben\nTravers farce at the Lyric. Perhaps Mr\nStoot could learn a few things from Mr\nTravers (90 years old and still going\nstrong). In The Bed Before Yesterday,\nMiss Plowright plays the widow still recovering from the shock of her wedding\nnight so many years before.\nThere are certain types of. plays that\nhave little appeal to me. I think it will have become obvious to you during the\npast year which those are and I leave it\nto you to find them out. I suspect that\nO'Ne ill's The Iceman Cometh would have\ncome into this category. It wasn't reviewed on. this page because illness in the cast prevented its opening.\n\u2022 THOMAS STEVENSON WANTED\nFELIX\nSTAFF!!\nAnyone interested in working for\nFELIX next year in any capacity\nshould contact Clive Dewey at the\nFELIX Office.\n\n"

PEE Middle East Comment\nTHE ISRAELI government attracts\ncriticism when it\n(a) rejects Palestinian Liberation\nOrganisation ( PLO) talk of a\" secular, democratic state in Palestine\" etc and\n(b) is sceptical of a solution to the Arab\nPalestinian problem outside the context\nof Jordan.\nI would like to show that this position\ndoes merit at least some sympathy,\nespecially with regard to point (a). Consider Lebanon, a good up-to-date\nexample of an opportunity to implement\nthe principles of a\" democratic, secular\nsecular state.\" Despite the fact that\nLebanon used to be held up as an\nexample in the Arab world (the only one!)\nwhere two very large religious groups\ncould coexist with reasonable freedom,\nLebanon' s political edifice has stood on\nfragile foundations for much of the time\nsince its complete independence from\nSyria in 1944, and we have no arrived\nat the point where the old balance of\nforces has completely broken down,\nnot without PLO connivance.\nBut even before the tragic events of\nthe last few months it was still a fact\nof Lebanese political life that the\nreligious background of an individual\nplayed a major role in his appointment to\nany public post or position of power.\nNow, why should this be so? The answer\nis that there just are no fully secular\nstates in the Middle East. This fact is neither good nor bad; it just is and has to be recognised as such. In Lebanon we graphically see Arabs\nof all kinds killing other Arabs of all kinds and little or no talk of a\" secular, democratic state.\" For discussion of (b)I would like to\nconsider the pre-1967 border between\nIsrael and Jordan, when the West Bank\nalso came under the sovereignty of\nKing Hussein. Then, the majority of\nArab Palestinians in the Middle East lived in Jordan, and the majority of\nJordanian citizens were Palestinian. Therefore it would not be unreasonable to\nthink of this as a Palestinian state. But\nKing Hussein is not a Palestinian, and\nso if his government is not representative\nof Palestinian wishes, a case can be\nmade out that this was an internal\nJordanian problem, and that Hussein and\nhis group per hp as should not be in power.\nIf Israel were to return Judaua and\nSamaria (the occupied West Bank) to\nJordan, there would in fact be a return to\na situation that existed for the twenty\nyears after the 1947 UN partition plan\nwhich had\" provided for the creation of\na separate Arab Palestinian state. It\nseems that while the West Barik was under Jordanian rule few people (except\nperhaps some Palestinians) believed in\nthe justice of an 'autonomous or\nindependent Arab Palestinian state. But things have changed and more people\nsubscribe to this point of view, and it\ncan be argued, rightly or wrongly, that a large Palestinian Arab entity on the pre-1967 territory of Jordon in place of the\nJus sein regime would be a more viable\nand stable state than a small one squeezed\nbetween Israel and an East Bank Jordan.\nI have been somewhat brief and\nchosen only two aspects of a very complex\nquestion. Of course the Israeli government\nis not always right, nevertheless I have\nendeavour ed to indicate that its foreign\npolicies have been formulated in the\ncontext of Middle East politics and on\nbasis of bitter historical lessons, and\ntherefore never merit wholesale\ncondemnation.\nDORI SCHM ETT ERLING PHOENIX.

Valiant IC give\nEngland squad\na tough time\n9 8 HH H H1ill A V.^Hf^ m fW Singleton scoring IC's only\ngoal of the match\nDAME ALICE OWEN'S Playing Fields at Whetstone,\nNorth London, provided the unlikely setting for a practice\nmatch between IC and an England XI on Wednesday\nafternoon. Despite getting lost, the IC squad arrived\nbefore the England team.\nAccording to England\nManager, Don Re vie, this\nmatch was to form the basis from which he would choose\nhis five substitutes for\nEngland Cup qualifying\nmatch against Finland in Helsinki this Sunday.\nThe match which lasted\nonly an hour was meant as a dummy game in which the IC team took on the role of the\ndefensive Finnish side. In a pre-match prep talk, Don Revie asked the IC team to\nplay a tight game and use\nman-for-man marking with a sweeper at the back. The result\nof IC employing these tactics, in the first half, meant that\nEngland scored only eight\ngoals \u2014 die first of which\ncame after only three minutes\nof play.\nIn one of their numerous\nattacks, IC managed to\nsalvage a goal towards the\nend of the first half. The goal came after IC had forced\na throw-in on the right; Mike\nDoyle headed out, but IC Captain, Jim Iley put the ball back in \u2014 it was flicked on\nby Pat Frampton to Phil Singleton who turned on the\n\"Good work-out for the\nboys\"-Revie\nball and pushed it under the\nadvancing body of Joe Corrigan.\nAsked to modify their game\nslightly in the second nai f,IC lifted their play and this\nproduced a much tighter\ngame. With less room to\nmanoeuvre in, England found\nthemselves being forced back\nand Corrigan had to make a few\nsaves to keep IG out.\nEngland' s domination of\nthe midfield was somewhat\nreduced with the substitution\nof Mick Popper with Steve\nBates. IC ventured out more\npositively during the middle\nof this half and in one the\nmore vigorous encounters,\nTony Towers had to leave the\nfield for several minutes with\na wrenched right foot after\nbeing involved in a tackle\nwith Ian Huntingdon.\nDespite IC's improved\nplay in the second half,\nEngland scored five more\ngoals to run out winners by\n13 goals to 1.\nIC: Kev Allen (subs D Aslam), Jim Iley, Dave\nBrabbim, Ian Huntingdon,\nChris Howley (subs Colin\nDurey), Terry Grimwade, Mick\nPopper, Phil Singleton (subs\nGareth Roberts), Terry Linden,\nPat Frampton, Bob Dutton.\nENGLAND: Joe Corrigan,\nDave Clements, Mike Doyle,\nBrian Greenhoff, Phil Neal,\nRay Kennedy (2), Butch\nWilkins (1), Tony Towers (1),\nPeter Taylor (I), Joe Royle (3),\nGordon Hill (S).

    "content": "mix3 Belles with balls!\nCado Belle in concert at the Red Cow in Hammersmith\nI'VE SEEN this band perform on no less\nthan eight occasions during the j a st three months. I was knocked out the first\ntime I he a red them, but amazingly they\nseem to improve with every gig. Last week\nat the Red Cow in Hammersmith Road\nthey pulled off one of the best gigs\nI 've seen in many a long day.\nThere' s no real doubt about it, if\ngood music still counts for anything\nthese days, then Cado Belle will make\nsome impact \u2014 things are beginning to\nhappen for the band at last. They' ve just signed a lucrative contract with\nAnchor Records, with just about every\nother major record company clam me ring for them to put their name on the dotted\nline.\nThe six-piece band hail from Glasgow, that seemingly endless cauldron of raw\ntalent. They feature the sure sax and\nand flute of Colin Tully the original\nguitar playing of Alan Darby, the tight-arse drumming of Davy Roy, the subtle\nkeyboard work of Stuart Mc Kill op, the\nfine singing of Maggie Reilly and the\nbrilliance of bass player Gavin Hodgson.\nBy pure definition they could best be\ndescribed as a funk band, using strong\nmelodic songs that are as in tell e gently written as they are tightly performed.\nThey owe very little to the soul orientated\nstyle of their fellow countrymen, the\nAverage White Band; Cado Belle's music\nbeing more structurally defined, only the\nthe foundation of the songs being anywhere\nnear soul based.\nThe opening number is always \" Tick To ck\", an instrumental that sets the\npattern for just about everything they\ndo. They play so tightly that they put\njust about every other outfit playing the\npub circuit to total shame. Then comes\n\"Airport Shutdown\", a well structured\nsong with Latin overtones. It gives the\nfirst opportunity for singer, Maggie Reilly, to show off her extensive vocal range.\nThe song has a light air to it, with\nTully switching to flute and Mc Kill op using string synthesis er. The intra of\n\" Go/ to Love\" has only the slightest\nleaning towards the AWB and the band\nare back into their tight, funky groove.\nThroughout the set, the band demonstrated the maturity of their writing,\nfrom the ultra-funk of \"Next Best Thing\"\nto \"Stone's Throw from Nowhere\",\na ballad that reeks of sheer class. An instrumental, \"E ill\", is the only song\nthat sounds slightly out of context with\nthe rest of the set. Played in unison of\na frightening pace by Tully and Darby,\nit perhaps owes more to the music of\nsay, the Eleventh House, before coming\ntowards the end when it slows down and\nMaggie comes in with some fine scat\nsinging, taking it back into the Cado\nBelle mould. The band end with the\nrousing \"Still Running\", the song having\na slight resemblance to Kokomo's end of\nset number, \" / can understand it\", with\nthe excellent guitarist Darby pulling off\nan extraordinary extended guitar solo, the\nsong guaranteed to bring any house\ndown.\nIf taken in the right context, this\nband is already as good as Kokomo\nwere at their best, and if handled by the\nright producer, Cado Belle could have a debut album on their hands to equal\nAWB' s first Atlantic recording. See this\nband now, when its cheap.\nIan Morse\nAll that glitters is not gold\nThe G band in concert at Hastings\nPier Pavilion\nTHE LAST Ents concert of this year\ntakes place in the Great Hall next\nSaturday, 19th June. The GB and( formerly the Glitter Band \u2014 even minus\nthe \" litter\" they don't seemed to have\nimproved) will be performing. Hopefully\na couple of hundred screaming little girls\nwill turn up, otherwise this concert\ncould be a financial disaster. However,\nEnts Chairman, Andy Higman, says that\nthey have sold more advanced tickets at\nthis stage than for any other concert.\nAt Hastings, most of the audience\nseemed intent on enjoying themselves\nwhatever happened. The result was400 drunken bopper s leaping about, a minority of whom fainted in front of the\nstage, screaming, crying, etc. The most\ndisturbing point concerning the concert\nwas that the band ran out of songs after\nan hour. However, if you're still around\nnext Saturday, get drunk, go along,\nlaugh, scream and sob!\nPhil Dean\nBankside Globe Playhouse\npresent\n\"Viva Espana\"\nby Anne McArthur\nfor two weeks from\nMonday 14th June\nat 8.00pm Tickets \u00a31.00\n\n"
