Having\nrecently become Dr May during the summer, he has since gone a\nstep further. On Monday he was confirmed as the new Chancellor\nfor Liverpool John Moores University. Essentially, he will be crucial\nin raising the university\u2019s profile by acting as an ambassador,\nsomething that shouldn\u2019t be too difficult judging by the amount of\ncolumn inches he has generated since returning to academia.\nSevere flaws in Imperial College Union\u2019s election procedures were highlighted as the purpose of the RON\ncampaign was undermined and rendered pointless.\nAt Monday night\u2019s Council meeting,\na by-election was held to fill the outstanding positions from last month\u2019s\nstudent-body election. However, one\ncandidate who had previously been\nbeaten by RON (Re-Open Nominations) in the undergraduate CGCUwide election stood again and was successfully elected as a Councillor, even\nthough she garnered even fewer votes\nthis time round compared to last.\nIn last month\u2019s Council elections the\ncandidate in question, Rosie Smithells,\ncollected 8 votes out of 74. 11 undergraduate engineering students voted\nRON. Students are supposed to vote\nRON if they are not satisfied that the\ncandidates running are up to scratch.\nIn the event of RON winning, the elections are supposed to be run again,\nhowever since this process takes about\na month the Union decided to run a\nby-election at Council.\nCouncil is an open meeting but due\nto the political apathy on campus it is\nrarely attended by anyone other than\nCouncillors and the most keen of stu-dents, thus only 7 people present were\neligible to vote for the \u201cUndergraduate\nEngineering Representative\u201d category,\ncompared to 74 voters in the original\nelection. Owen Connick received 5\nvotes, whilst Rosie Smithells collected\nthe remaining 2 votes leaving RON\nwith 0. Thus RON lost by only 2 votes\nin the by-election, but won by 3 votes\nin the original election.\nMs Smithells was perfectly entitled\nto re-run for a position on Council;\nnothing prohibits this in the Union\nConstitution (a huge document detailing the ins-and-outs of how the Union\nmust be run), however the whole debacle has highlighted how flawed the\nelections procedures are.\nIn the current system, 7 votes cast by\nengineers present at a Council by-elec-tion hold more weight than 74 votes\nfrom the whole engineering body. This\nsuggests that the views held by people who turn up to Council (an event\nwhich even the politically-interested\nfind too boring to contemplate attend-ing) are more valuable than the views\nof those who were interested enough\nto actually vote in the election-proper.\nFurthermore, the purpose of RON\nhas been questioned. Currently RON\nfunctions with the hope that more candidates will come forward in the subsequent election, however the system\nis flawed when nobody new stands; a\npersistent candidate can keep standing\nfor election unless they are beaten to it\nTom Roberts\n& Andrew Somerville\nGoing back to basics\nby someone else.\nIn theory, the electorate can keep\nvoting RON until the candidate improves their election campaign or gets\nfed up with standing. However, the\nelectorate effectively changed during\nthese Council elections: from a faculty-wide pool of students to one restricted\nto those who bothered to attend Monday night\u2019s committee meeting. It has\nbeen argued that nothing was strictly\nwrong with the by-election since it\nwas open to all engineering students.\nWhilst true, this is hugely unrealis-tic; advertising for the by-election has\nbeen nonexistent, and even then how\nmany students are willing to turn up\nto a meeting compared to going online\nand voting?\nIf Ms Smithells had written a manifesto or campaigned at all for the initial\nelection she would have almost certainly been elected, but at least she has\nturned up to all the Council sessions\nthis term. One candidate who was successfully elected during the by-elec-tion didn\u2019t even attend the by-election\nmeeting due to having rugby practice\non Mondays. Council is always held on\na Monday, begging the question, how\nwill Mr Saleme be able to attend in future meetings if he can\u2019t even make it\nto his own election?\nIn fact, the only person not to be\nelected at the by-election was one Jon\nMatthews, last seen storming out of\nCouncil following his resignation after\nthe second rejection of his GSA report,\nlosing by 11 votes to Amar Joshi.\nElecting Councillors has been a painful process this year and there are still\npositions to be filled on the committee.\nThe problems with the election process need examining; it is absurd that\nsomeone can re-run for an election\nso soon after the student body has decided they are not fit for the position,\nespecially when the second pool of\nvoters is smaller than the first. As with\nall democracy, it seems that those with\nthe most hunger for power will always\nbe the ones being \u201celected\u201d.\nCandidate successfully elected with 2 votes having been\nrejected in a faculty-wide election only weeks beforehand\n\n"

Listen up and take notes!\nNigel Cooke\nStudent Advisor\nGenital Herpes\nThis also at first does not\npresent with any symptoms\nandcangoweeksundiagnosed.\nWhen symptoms do present\nthey can include itchiness or\nburning around the genitals,\npain when passing urine and\nsmall blisters rather like cold\nsores around the genitals that\nwhen burst leave sores. One of\nthe worst...\nChlamydia\nThis is a very dangerous infection and does not have any\nnoticeable symptoms - which\nis why it is spread so easily.\nIn some cases, however, men\nwill suffer a discharge from the\npenis and may experience inflammation of the tube leading\nto the bladder. If this infection\nis left untreated it can result in\ninfertility, which is certainly not\ngood!\nGenital Warts\nSmall white spots appear on\ngenitals \u2013 this is the only recognizable symptom but they may\nnot appear for weeks after in-fection. Nasty! There is no cure,\nand they cause the vast majority of cervical cancer cases.\nHIV\nMany people now think that\nthis infection is confined to\nAfrica but HIV is out there and\nanyone can get it at any time\nwhen having unprotected sex.\nSome people experience flu-like symptoms a few weeks\nafter infection, however it is\nusually initially symptomless:\nthe only way of knowing you\nare infected is if you have a\nspecific test.\nGonorrhea\nOften known as the clap, the\nsymptoms include discharge\nfrom the penis or vagina which\ncan appear yellow or green.\nYou can also get pain when\nurinating. My eyes are gushing\nwith water!\nSyphilis\nThis infection was massive\nback in the 1800\u2019s however\nhas come back with avengous\nrecently. Symptoms normally\nbegin with a small sore on\nthe penis or vagina also flu\nsymptoms may appear if left\nuntreated can lead to mental\nhealth problems. Lunch is now\nnot looking so appealing!\nStudents, in general, get their first\nreal taste of freedom when they come\nto university. It is a time to try new\nthings, meet new people and generally start growing up and becoming a\nyoung adult. For most, a part of this\ninvolves sex. Yes. Sex. I said it!\nSome of you may be thinking about\nbecomingsexuallyactive.Othersmight\nbe thinking about having more sex. By\nnow you have probably either forgotten all the things you were told during\nthat sex education class back in school\nor you just didn\u2019t pay attention; either\nbecause you were too embarrassed or\nshocked or just couldn\u2019t stop giggling.\nSo this week\u2019s article is all about sex.\nThe number of people with sexually\ntransmitted diseases is actually on the\nrise in this country. The Health Protection Agency found that between 2005\nand 2006, diagnoses of new sex infections rose by 2% to 376,508 and most\nof these cases were amongst young\npeople.\nIt is important, when at university,\nto be aware of your surroundings.\nOften with a sense of freedom comes\ncomplacency to all things that cause\nharm. This may even transpire to having unprotected sex with a variety of\npartners.\nWith more and more cases of sexually transmitted diseases being discov-ered, not to mention the risk of preg-nancy, five minutes of unprotected fun\ncan result in consequences you end up\npaying for for a very long time.\nSexually transmitted infections such\nas chlamydia, genital herpes, genital\nwarts, syphilis, gonorrhea and HIV\nare out there in the student and wider\ncommunity but what exactly are these\ninfections? See the panel on the right\nfor a brief rundown.\nSHAG Week is a campaign to encourage students to be safe when indulging in sexual encounters and to get\nthem thinking about the consequences\nof unprotected sex.\nThe campaign is aimed to get the\nmessage across in a fun way and there\nare lots of event going on all week, so\ncome along and get involved!\nIf you think you have an STI it is best\nto contact either your GP or the local\nGUM clinic on: 020 8846 6699. We\u2019ll\nalso be handing out leaflets with information about sexual health clinics in\nthe local area, including GUM clinics\nwhere you can get tested for a host of\nsexually transmitted infections. There\nis also a list of family planning clinics\nwhere you can get advice about con-traception, pregnancy tests and often\nreferalls for terminations.\nIf you are worried about issues relating to sexual health or have any queries\nplease do not hesitate to contact the\nInformation and Advice Centre (see\nemail address above). There is also a\nhost of websites where you can find\nmore specific information on a range\nof sexual health issues:\nwww.fpa.org.uk\nwww.nhsdirect.nhs.uk\nwww.brook.org.uk\nI\nmperial College Union SHAG\n(Sexual Health And Guidance)\nWeek is about to hit our campus!\nDespite the name, this is not an\ninvitation for budding Casanovas to demonstrate their sexual prowess everywhere from the dreary depths\nof Mech Eng to the dizzy heights of the\nHuxley Building. However it is a chance\nto talk more openly about the nature of\nsexual relationships while indulging in\nfun activities, hot entertainments and\npicking up lots of sexy freebies.\nEvery lunchtime next week we will\nbe giving out S.H.A.G Bags, filled with\nuseful goodies and important informa-tion, all around campus. We will also\nbe teaming up with Boots to give out\nfree Chlamydia tests and calling for\nbetter Sexual Health facilities to be\nmade available at the South Kensington Campus and in our Halls of Residence. With all this on offer don\u2019t miss\nout on getting one of our great red (re-cycled paper) bags for free!\nSHAG Week is not just about enjoying sex without endangering yourself\nand others. It is also about recognising\nhow Sexual Transmitted Diseases can\ndestroy other people\u2019s lives. Throughout the week our educational events\nwill be raising money for two AIDs\nCharities in the run up to World AIDs\nDay on the 1st December. You can\nshow your support by attending our\nSexpression Finale on Friday 30th November with an exclusive Pole Dancing Show in dBs and an Ann Summers\nParty in the Union Dining Hall. Free\ndrinks receptions will be available at\nboth Partys which start at 8pm and all\nproceeds will be split between Children\nWith AIDs Charity (CWAC) and Positively Healthy UK. You can also wear\na red ribbon or a red t-shirt to pledge\nyour support to these two great AIDs\nCharities by giving a small donation at\none of our stalls.\nAlong with all of our fundraising\nactivities we will also be making a\nstand against AIDs by creating a giant\nred ribbon on Upper Dalby Court on\nWednesday afternoon. This is an easy\nway that you can show your support\nfor World AIDs Day while doing something whacky. Don\u2019t forget to wear\nsomething red or pick up one of our\nCharity T-shirts to get involved in this\n\u2018Flash Mob\u2019 event!\nI hope there will be something for\neveryone during S.H.A.G Week and\nhowever you get involved we should all\nbe able to do our bit for these incredible charities while challenging and\nchanging our own perspectives.\nThe UN Millennium Declaration set a\ngoal to halt and reverse the spread of\nHIV by 2015. In order to achieve this,\na further goal was set of reaching universal access to treatment by 2010. But\nthese goals are far from being achieved.\nCurrently, over 40 million people are\ninfected with the virus and 25 million\npeople have already died, whilst 72% of\nthose in urgent need of anti retroviral\n(ARV) therapy remain untreated. The\nadvent of ARVs has revolutionised the\ncare of HIV-positive individuals, giving\nthem a much better quality and length\nof life. For the majority of HIV-positive\nindividuals living in the developing\nworld, the problem is therefore not the\nlack of an existing treatment, but the\nlack of political will to provide it.\nPoliticians of the G8 countries have\nrepeatedly promised to increase funding in an attempt to counter the ever-increasing evidence that the targets for\nHIV/AIDS treatment will not be met.\nIn June this year, they announced a\nplan to treble the funding to the Global Fund, a major financer in the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS. But at the \u2018Replenishment Conference\u2019 in September,\nGordon Brown announced that the UK\ngovernment would provide only half of\nthe \u00a3700million previously promised\nover the next three years. With the\nUK\u2019s strategy for HIV/AIDS for the\nnext three years due in early 2008, this\nas a poor sign for things to come.\nStaying positive about HIV and AIDS\nNo one ever expected it to be easy\nto achieve these goals, but as Gordon Brown said in July at the UN, the\npromises of politicians of the West\nmust not be broken if we are to accomplish them:\n\u201cWe cannot allow our promises that\nbecame pledges to descend into just\naspirations, and then wishful thinking,\nand then only words that symbolise\nbroken promises.\nWe did not make the commitment\nto the Millennium Development Goals\nonly for us to be remembered as the\ngeneration that betrayed promises\nrather than honoured them and undermined trust that promises can ever\nbe kept.\u201d\nFenella Beynon\nMedsin Imperial\nHelp push Gordon Brown to\nkeep his word. There are plenty\nof things you can do in the fight\nagainst HIV/AIDS, such as lobbying your MP\n. Easy ways to do\nthis and other things you can\ndo can be found at: http://peo-pleandplanet.org/treataidsnow/\ntakeaction/\nIf you want to find out more\nabout HIV/AIDS, or show your\nsupport, come along to some of\nthe Medsin Positively Red AIDS\nAwareness Week events around\ncampus. All money raised will\nbe split between two charities:\nChildren with AIDS Charity, and\nPositively Healthy UK.\n26-30th november\n\n"

After a conversion which seems to have largely\nconsisted of adding swirling chrome\nstaircases and coloured blinds, it has\nplayed host to a collection of musicians including Aled Jones and PJ Harvey. After arriving early, a thoroughly\npleasant half hour was spent in the\nchurch\u2019s caf\u00e9, located beneath the main\nhall in the crypt. Despite the predictably inflated prices which plague these\nsupposedly high-brow events, the time\nflew by sipping coffee and discussing\nthe minutiae, my journey and reasons\nfor being there with some amiable pensioners from Kent. It also gave me the\nbizarrely memorable experience of urinating next to a robed man wielding an\nammunition case.\nTonight we were treated to the grand\nfinaleoftheBarbican\u2019sRamadanNights\n\u2013 a series of concerts taking place\nthroughout the Islamic festival. Two\ngroups from vastly different Islamic\ncultures descended upon this venue\nusually steeped in Christian tradition.\nOpening proceedings were Gaza native\nMoneim Adwah and his group Rouh\nWaheda, making their first appearance\non these shores. Consisting of Adwah\non vocals and oud, Sayed Ghoneimy\nShaban on kawala and percussionist\nMando Al-Sowerki, they performed\nforty minutes of Adwah\u2019s own brand\nof traditional Palestine folk music. As\na westerner from a particularly blinkered town in the north of England,\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I truly understood\nthe music. Although the musicians\ninvolved are obviously extremely tal-ented, and there is quite clearly some\nbeauty in the largely percussive sound,\nthe music could be found to be slightly\nimpenetrable to the uneducated ear.\nDoubtless the \u201cwe listen to world music because it makes us seem cultured\n\u2013 lead us, Jools Holland\u201d brigade were\nappreciating it though.\nNext came the main attraction of\nthe evening. From the Sinai peninsula\nin Egypt came the Bedouin Jerry Can\nBand. Clad in the traditional jellaba\nof the Bedouin people, this band of\nmen (and one woman) sit on stage in\na semi-circle around a (pretend) fire,\nescaping the tedium of the city for the\nsweeping dunes and sandstone cliffs of\nthe Sinai.\nThe group used an interesting blend\nof traditional instruments, such as the\nsimsimiyya (a kind lyre used in the area\naround Port Said), and the ney (a kind\nof flute that has been around since\nAncient Egyptian times) coupled with\nmore recent and improvised instru-ments, including assorted ammunition\nboxes and the eponymous Jerry Can.\nThis juxtaposition of old and new itself\ntells a story of the fight the Bedouins\nhave in moving forward with time, but\nmaintaining their ancient traditions.\nThe group themselves tell us that\nsongs and poems are now distributed\nbetween the Bedouins not just through\nword of mouth, but also through MP3\u2019s\nand mobile phone recordings.\nThe music, poetry and dancing that\nfollows is a completely encapsulating\nexperience: vocalists and musicians\nchange roles with abandon, and any\nmember who isn\u2019t needed for a song\ngets up and has a dance. That is with\nthe exception of poet Soliman Agmaan\nMohammed Agmaan, who frankly\nlooks slightly too old and far too wise.\nThe group performed songs from their\ndebut album, Coffee Time, so named\nbecause of the great importance of\ncoffee in the culture. Fantastically for\nthose slightly fatigued from a rush-hour long journey from west London,\nthe performance was accompanied\nby a demonstration in the method of\ncoffee brewing traditional to the Sinai.\nAlthough the group seemed vaguely\nembarrassed by the electric heater they\nwere forced to use (damn those health\nand safety fascists) and the fact they\nhad to distribute said coffee in polystyrene cups (damn those cost analysis\nfascists), it created a wonderful aroma\nthroughout the airy church.\nThis unlikely group of Bedouins\ncame to be in England through the\nmentorship of Zakaria Ibrahim who,\nwith his El Mastaba Centre, is attempting to reignite the traditional popular\nmusic of Egypt after years of steady\nAmericanisation. In fact Ibrahim, a\nvaguely dishevelled man of forty clad\nin a scruffy jumper joined his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s\non stage for the last two songs and a\nsomewhat more lengthy rant at the\ncrowd. Despite this, it is hard not to be\nendeared to a group with such talent,\nsuch enthusiasm, and such a passion\nfor caffeinated beverages. As the poet\nAgmaan says: \u201c\u201cWe make the coffee\nstrong to clear your mind... your mind\nwill become good on the second cup\u201d \u2013\na mantra by which to live your life.\nThe members of the Bedouin Jerry Can Band somehow looking cool, yet sweltering at the same time\n\n"

The first glimpse you get of\nLouise Bourgeois\u2019 work is the grand\nsculpture, \u2018Maman\u2019, outside the build-ing. It is a giant black spider-like creature that towers over you, harbouring\nits marble eggs beneath it. It\u2019s dark and\nsinister, yet the description beside it\ninforms me Bourgeois compares it to\nher mother. Perhaps not the most flattering dedication, it makes you wonder\nwhat to expect from Bourgeois in the\nexhibition inside.\nI feel obliged to mention the current installation in the Turbine Hall\n\u2013 \u2018Shibboleth\u2019 by Doris Salcedo. Tate\nModern is littered with signs that say\n\u201cwarning: please watch your step\u201d, and\nfor good reason. Not so much a sculp-ture, \u2018Shibboleth\u2019 is a long crack in the\nconcrete floor that runs from the entrance to the far wall. Looking upwards\nfor the usual grand-scale masterpiece,\nI nearly missed it. It\u2019s unexpectedly\nfun \u2013 the Turbine Hall was full of tourists walking along it, arty types lowering their cameras into it, and children\nsticking their heads into it. I like to\nimagine what the Tate curators and\nexecutives said when Salcedo delivered\nher proposal: \u201cwell, mostly I\u2019m going\nto be drilling through your floor\u201d. The\nonly downside is the commentary accompanying it, which is the most re-diculous thing I have ever read. I quote:\n\u201cWalking down Salcedo\u2019s incised line...\nmight well prompt a broader consider-them for a cocktail-and-stew party.\nThen all came and had a good time\u201d.\nGood stuff.\nThe exhibition soon turns its focus to\nBourgeois\u2019 works of sculpture. Early on\nare a series of pillars made of stacked\npieces of painted wood, like miniature\nskyscrapers or fish spines. One, to me,\nlooks like a kebab with chunks of red\nmeat. Perhaps this is what comes of\nwalking round the exhibition hungry.\nDespite the shift of the focus, I still\nprefer Bourgeois\u2019 drawings in black\nink, which show off her precise technical skill. In particular there are three\n\u2018Untitled\u2019 pieces in room four. One is\na glass house full of child-like lollipop\nbushes which I find charming. I want\nto colour them in with green watercolour paint, then add red fruits and pink\nflowers in felt tip.\nRoom five is the beginning of the or-ganic, cocoon-like sculptures Louise\nBourgeois is famous for. People crowd\nround them as if waiting for them to\nhatch. They are not the kind of pretty\nthings I would want to take home with\nme, but they are elegant in their dark\nmystery. My favourites out of them\nare the shiny ones in bronze with gold\npatina, particularly \u2018Untitled (Fingers)\u2019\nwhich remind me more of lithops. I\u2019m\nafraid the one to its right, \u2018Lair\u2019, looks\nlike a turd, and nothing more.\nBy room six the sculptures have become more human, hinting at different\nbody parts. \u2018Amoeba\u2019, not resembling\nits name at all, could either be an insect\u2019s nest or a man\u2019s face. Reading the\nlabel beside \u2018Fillette (Sweeter Version)\u2019\nreveals that the sculpture is supposed\nto be a penis and testicles, and it\u2019s not\njust my dirty mind. In fact, just about\nall the sculptures are sexual in some\nway. \u2018Le Trani Episode\u2019 \u2013 what a name!\n- is supposed to be breasts pressed\nagainst eachother. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m\nseeing potatoes. Then there\u2019s a group\nof four sculptures hanging from the\nceiling that are pretty much just four\nvaginas. The commentary says there\u2019s\na penis in there as well, but really all\nI\u2019m getting is cunt. As you progress\nround, the sculptures become increasingly grand, in marble and gold, but the\nsubject matter is still raw and sexual.\n\u2018Mamelles\u2019 is a wall of big, bulging pink\nbreasts with angry nipples. \u2018Sleep II\u2019 is\napparently a contrast between the subject (a soft, floppy penis) and the hard\nmarble it is made of. You have to marvel\nat art as a profession. In what other career can you wake up and think \u201ctoday\nI am going to make a massive marble\nforeskin, and everybody will love it\u201d.\nIn room eight the scale shifts to BIG.\nA series of metal cages surrounding\nfound objects like a chairs and glass\nbubbles. The huge cells of wood and\nmetal are a delight to walk around \u2013\nyou can peek through the gaps in the\nwalls, never knowing what you\u2019re going to see next. From clothes to furniture to blood red entertwined hands\nmade of wax. Another spider, twinned\nwith the one outdoors, nearly touches\nthe ceiling. Despite its size, the thin\nspindly legs make it appear delicate\nand graceful.\nThe final room rounds up the exhibition with a series of glass cases\nlike cabinets of curiosities. Inside are\nsmaller renditions of works I\u2019ve seen as\nI\u2019ve walked round the gallery. Dress rehearsal art. They make you realise how\nmuch time and thought have gone into\nBourgeois\u2019 art, and how much of her\n95 (and counting!) year-long life she\nhas dedicated to it.\nWhile Louise Bourgeois\u2019 work is not\nmy favourite kind of modern art, I still\nenjoyed the exhibition immensely. The\nart is beautiful in its own sinister way,\nand I liked Bourgeois for the personality she exudes through her painting\nand sculpture, and for her shamelessly\ndaring subject matter.\nThe visit will be well worth your \u00a38\nstudent-rate ticket, especially since entrance to the Tate Modern itself is free\nto all.\nMaman, the giant spider, leers down on prospective visitors as they approach the exhibition at the main Tate building. The eggs are particularly \u2018eww\u2019-evoking\nation of power\u2019s divisive operations as\nencoded in the brutal narratives of co-lonialism, their unhappy aftermaths in\npostcolonial nations, and in the standoff between rich and poor, northern\nand southern hemispheres\u201d. Oh really?\nWell, I largely considered how many\npeople had dropped valuables down it\nso far.\nAgainst the expectations set up by\nthe giant spider, the Louise Bourgeois\nexhibition starts off small. The first\nroom is a series of neat, manageable\npaintings. \u2018Fallen Woman\u2019, which refers both to the shame brought upon\nwomen who have sex outside of mar-riage, and also alludes to Bourgeois\u2019\nfears of failing, is touching. You immediately identify with Bourgeois in that\nshe gives the impression of being a real\nperson with real insecurities. Also in\nroom one, her \u2018Femme Maison\u2019 tackles\nthe female identity. A play on the title\nmeaning both housewife and \u201cwoman\nhouse\u201d, the paintings are of houses\nwith waving arms and knobbly knees.\nThey\u2019re dark and gloomy, but with a\nsense of humour. A further insight into\nBourgeois\u2019 motivation is \u2018Cell (Choisy)\u2019,\nwhich is a scale model of her childhood\nhome inside a metal cage and relay\u2019s\nthe artist\u2019s traumatic childhood.\nThe works in the next room are\nalso of a smaller scale. The series of\ntext and ink works entitled \u2018He Disappeared into Complete Silence\u2019 is horrendously sinister, but comical with it.\nMy favourite parable reads: \u201cOnce a\nman was angry at his wife, he cut her in\nsmall pieces, made a stew of her. Then\nhe telephoned to his friends and asked\n\n"

Thankfully, one man worth the hype, Wes\nAnderson, continues to know what he\ndoes best. And do it better.\nAlways watchable, Anderson has\nreached new levels of rewatch-ability with a story so seemingly\nsimple that the appeal can appear\ndifficult to explain to someone\nunfamiliar with the Anderson\nmould. As three estranged brothers reconnect on a train journey across exotic India, Adrien\nBrody, Owen Wilson and Jason\nSchwartzman lift the quirky siblings beyond the script and into\ntrue characters, all set against the\ngorgeous backdrop that allows Anderson the chance to explore his\ncinematography skills beyond the\nscope of his previous features.\nThe staples of his oeuvre are all still\nhere though, and the family of filmmakers that he has built around him\nfeature strongly here, especially Wilson\nwith whom he has worked consistently\nsince their debut feature, Bottle Rocket.\nJason Schwartzman returns to the fray\nfollowing his turn in Rushmore, showing that maturity as an actor has seen\nhis talent grow, and should see him\nbreak out to a larger audience following smaller roles in I Heart Huckabees\nand the atrocious Marie Antoinette.\nBill Murray even pops up again in a\ncameo role for continuity.\nAnderson and his filmic family are\nnothing short of fascinating,\nwith an appreciation of\nhuman\nWes Anderson welcomes us on board his Indian voyage with his latest take on the modern family unit\nMovies based on video games don\u2019t have to be crap \u2013 so why are they?\nIt\u2019s been quite fashionable to buy the\nmovie rights to videogames for some\ntime now. With almost 30 such movies made in the last fifteen years and\na whopping 43 to be launched in the\nnext three years or so, the popularity of\nVG movies among major Hollywood\nstudios is undeniable. However, the resulting cinematic productions have almost invariably been thrashed by film\ncritics and alienated fans. Being an avid\ngamer myself, I\u2019ve wondered on many\noccasions why films \u201cinspired\u201d from\nvideogames just aren\u2019t capable of delivering on their potential \u2013 and whether\nthis potential is actually attainable.\nTending to the more simple issue\nfirst, I\u2019ll look at the latter part of the\nquestion. It stands to reason that films\nand games come from two different\nmediums. Films, while absorbing experiences in themselves, can hardly\nbecome as enticing and (oh dear, here\nit is) addictive as their VG counter-parts. Given their different underlying\ncharacteristics, an exaggerated level\nof imitation between the two is likely\nto produce hilarious effects, the first\nperson camera view used in Doom\u2019s\nbig screen appearance being a perfect\nexample thereof. So basically, a good\nadaptation would presume the writers\nand directors of the films to acknowledge the different materials at hand\nand work from there on to recreate\nand further develop the storyline and\nthe characters.\nBut seriously now, this is a no-brain-er. The actual cause underpinning the\n(few) mediocre and (many) bad VG\nmovies is of a financial nature, as well\nas a perceptual one. The major film\nstudios, in their search for highly rewarding business opportunities, have\nidentified this sector as an extremely\nlucrative one: gamers are seemingly\nunpretentious and loyal to their favourite games. So instead of hiring able and\nexpensive directors/writers who are\ncapable of fulfilling the metamorphosis\nof a videogame to a film, the studios go\nfor several \u201cexperienced\u201d names of the\ngenre, whose adaptations have brought\nin vast amounts of money for arguably\nsmall investments \u2013 the likes of Paul\nW.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, Alien versus Predator) and\nUwe Boll (Alone in the Dark, Bloodrayne, etc.) come to mind. Their recipe\nfor success is grounded in the idea that\nsexy lead actresses and buckets of gore\nand violence ensure high weekend box\noffice revenues. Of course, this does\nnot apply to VG movies only, as most\nof today\u2019s \u201chorror\u201d films abide by the\nsame principles.\nAlong the way, game franchises such\nas Resident Evil get massacred on the\nbig screen, as storyline and characters\nare sacrificed in order to offer the likes\nof Milla Jovovich some more screen\ntime (nothing against that in general,\njust not under these circumstances).\nPerhaps a defining moment for the\ngenre took place when the producers of Resident Evil went for Anderson\u2019s script of Resident Evil, instead of\nchoosing the more game-faithful version of a milestone figure in the business of the undead, George Romero.\nConsequently, the films have come to\nappeal mostly to those people who are\nsatisfied by the genre of action/horror\nfilms, and not to the fans \u201cfor\u201d whom\nthey were made.\nOn the other hand, even faithful adaptations don\u2019t ensure a quality film \u2013\nmainly because successfully adapting a\nvideogame to the big screen is far more\ndifficult than it seems. It\u2019s no secret\nthat many games lack substance, so the\nscripts resulting from them are pretty\nslim \u2013 which poses a serious problem\nfor a ninety minute movie. This is\nwhere the quality of a good screenwriter would come in handy and \u2013 surely\n\u2013 a good collaboration with the game\nproducers (who themselves sometimes forget about their buyers and get\nswayed by percentages) wouldn\u2019t harm\nanyone either.\nIn the end though, game fans aren\u2019t\nlooking for The Seventh Seal when\nwatching these adaptations. A cool,\nmind-blowing, special-effects ridden\nexperience might do as well, as long\nas it has a decent story behind it. And\nmore often than not, the cornerstones\nof the story are already available in\nthe games. Succeeding in implementing the aforementioned factors would\nnot only satisfy and mystify gamers; it\nwould also let other people enjoy these\nfilms.\nSo VG movies are bad because studios choose to believe that gamers\ndon\u2019t expect a lot, just because they\nlike blowing the brains off rotting\nzombies, or controlling a hot, under-dressed female Indiana Jones around\nwatery caves and dusty rooftops. Why\nis it so hard not look down on someone\njust because they enjoy having some\nfun every once in a while? Sure, not all\ngamers become world renowned sci-entists, doctors or managers, but we\u2019re\ntalking about a matter of principle here.\nThere is no big difference between the\ngame industry and the film industry,\nas both relish the prospect of milking\ninnocent fans of their (and sometimes\ntheir relatives\u2019) money, but at least every now and then they offer something\nworthwhile, something truly special\nand genuinely life altering.\nThe VG movies industry on the other hand seems to have taken over the\nworst of both worlds and that makes\nfor an extremely distasteful experi-ence. Is it really that hard to stand up\nto our gamerish expectations, or do\nthe film producers think it\u2019s just not\nworth bothering because the money\nwill come in anyway?\nStefan Carpanu\nAlex Casey\nFilm Editor\nrelationships that continually crop up\nin their cinematic depitction of unusual family units. While Rushmore\ncentred on a student trying to form a\nfamily outside his own, The Royal Tenenbaums took a much more direct approach to dysfunctional relations and\nthen The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou provided a working family, parallel\nto the environment in which Anderson\nhas grown his own career. Darjeeling\nhowever, whilst not succumbing to\nthe mundane norm,\ndoes at least contain horizons of\nidentification\nthat make the\nbrothers infinitely more\nhuman, pushing it beyond\neven the immense\nenjoyability of his\naforementioned\nprevious\nfeatures.\nAlso stepping back on board with\nDarjeeling is Randall Poster, the stalwart music supervisor, the man who\nscored The Life Aquatic almost entirely with a Portuguese folk translation of David Bowie\u2019s greatest hits.\nSoundtracks are a defining part of\nthe Anderson experience\nand the sounds of\nthe Kinks interspersed\nwith the\nold scores\nof Satyajit Ray\u2019s\nfilms, not\nto mention the hilarious uses of Peter\nSarstedt\u2019s Where Do You Go To (My\nLovely), are a true delight here. Regardless of whether the direction requires it, Poster\u2019s scoring anchors each\nmoment and emotion perfectly.\nDarjeeling never fails to set the perfect scene; whether in a Parisian hotel\nas is the setting of the opening accompaniment piece, the short film Hotel\nChevalier, or in the heart of India,\nAnderson projects an insight beyond\nmost filmmakers. His attention to detail and reflection on the more unconventional aspects of humanity make\nhim endearing, whether he is creating\nlosers, winners, has-beens or will-bes.\nFor the uninitiated, I beseech you to\ngive this a try. Whilst by no means an\nauteur in an individual right, Anderson has his personal stamp all over\nthis film. If ever a cinema term\nneeded to be redefined here, The\nDarjeeling Limited would be the\nultimate family film.\nThe Darjeeling Limited \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nWriters: Wes Anderson,\nJason Schwartzman\nCast: Adrien Brody,\nOwen Wilson,\nJason Schwartzman\nBorn to be\nwild.

In Morocco, the local market stall\nworkers have learned an extremely useful English phrase. When you\u2019re haggling over an item fiercely, absolutely\nconvinced that the salesman is trying\nto fleece you and accusing them of that\nvery crime, they\u2019ll whip this classic out\nof the bag: \u201cWhy are you so paranoid?\u201d\nYou think, \u201cWhy am I being so para-noid; I\u2019m on holiday!\u201d you settle for\nthe price and that\u2019s when they\u2019ve really\nfleeced you. There are few things more\nannoying than thinking someone has\ngot the better of you and is laughing at\nyou behind your back because of it.\nThe lesson here is that the discerning tourist must use his judgement to\ndecide when and to what extent it is\nappropriate to haggle and accept that\nsometimes you will be unwittingly exploiting poor people or playing into\nunscrupulous vendors\u2019 hands. Life\u2019s\ntough like that.\nas \u2018Strachan Mackenzie\u2019 and the poor\nlocal vendor as \u2018Tiny Tim.\u2019 These are\njust arbitrary names that I got from\na random word generator. Now, rich\nMr. Mackenzie wants to get a flavour\nof the local culture by driving down\nthe price of the handicraft he wants\nto buy. It\u2019s a simple wooden sculpture,\ndepicting an emperor from the country\u2019s ancient heyday in a humorously\nerotic situation. Strachan Mackenzie\njust happens to enjoy erotic woodwork\nand has amassed a large collection in\nhis stately home. In his own currency\nthe amount that Mackenzie is haggling\nover is about 20p.\nTiny Tim is just 11 years old. His\nmother runs the stall, normally, but has\nbeen taken ill with a condition that has\nall the hallmarks of a nasty infectious\ndisease, which is often fatal in this part\nof the world. When Tim isn\u2019t helping\nhis mother in the market he generally\nworks an 18hr day, with breaks to run\nto the nearest well (a mere ten miles\naway) to acquire water for himself, his\nmother and his nine younger siblings.\nTim has never been to school and has\nonly a rudimentary idea of numeracy.\nThe 20p that is the centre of the protracted negotiations could make the\ndifference between affording a ride to\na local hospital to see if anything can\nbe done about his mother\u2019s worsening state. His pride prevents him from\nrevealing this fact to tourist in front of\nhim though.\nWhile the intolerably hot, fictional\nsun bears down on them, Mr. Mackenzie refuses to back down so the desperate Tim must accede, since he cannot\nturn down the sale. Even the tiny profit\nmade will help to an extent. Strachan\nholds his prize up against the sunlight\nand laughs again at its sexual overtones\nbefore using the wooden figure\u2019s manhood to perform a lewd action on his\nwife, who is not amused. This desecration of his culture\u2019s most revered historic figure is the final insult for Tim,\nwho breaks down into tears. The salty\ntears run down his face and drip on\nto the earthen floor and are trampled\nunderfoot by Strachan Mackenzie\u2019s expensive Gore-Tex hiking boots.\nYes, this was a protracted way of\nsaying that sometimes when you haggle over amounts of money that seem\nsmall to you, in order to \u2018experience\nthe local culture,\u2019 you should realize\nthese values could be small fortunes to\nlocals.\nThere are flipsides to this. That is to\nsay, there are arguments for haggling\nin many situations. Local merchants\nare the undisputed kings of emotional\nblackmail. They\u2019re even better at it\nthan mothers. I have heard people in\nmarkets use the difference in value\nof money between countries as a way\nto convince tourists into settling for\na higher price.

Perhaps this page\ncan offer practical and moral guidance\nto travelling people (not in the gypsy\nsense, of course). This, in turn, led me\nto think of the issues that face travellers as they delve into the unknown\nregions. The constant threat of theft,\ninsulting foreign cultures, personal in-jury, getting lost and being murdered\nare all issues that are worth discussing\nand are of considerable importance to\nthe wary wanderer. There is one particular topic that I feel warrants special\nconcern this week; many intrepid holidaymakers feel a compulsion to dabble\nin the curious art of haggling.\nHaggling is not a ubiquitous phe-nomenon. In Japan, for example, haggling is usually just a matter of asking\nfor a discount once and then being\ndeclined or accepted. Haggling in\nwestern, developed nations can permeate many types of purchases but is\nusually confined to markets. In many\ncountries however, especially in North\nAfrica and South East Asia, haggling is\na huge part of day-to-day life for locals\nand tourists alike.\nSo negotiating a price is not universal but it is certainly widespread\nenough that you\u2019re more than likely to\ncome across it at some point. But the\nquestion is: just because you can hag-gle, should you? I\u2019m not talking about\nlocals haggling with other locals for\ngoods. This is clearly beyond reproach;\nit is a part of their culture and helps to\nensure fair prices for both vendor and\nseller, sustaining the local economy.\nWhat I\u2019m referring can be best appreciated with the following example.\nI\u2019m sure many of you have witnessed\nscenes like this before.\nRelatively wealthy tourist, from de-veloped, affluent nation with strong\ncurrency in an impoverished third\nworld country haggles with a poor local\nvendor in a market. Without throwing\nany bias or prejudice into this exam-ple, let us refer to the wealthy tourist\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got to haggle\u201d Monty Python send up the idea of haggling\nin \u2018The Life Of Brian\u2019\n\u201cYou think, \u2018Why\nam I being so\nparanoid? I\u2019m\non holiday!\u2019 You\nsettle for the\nprice and that\u2019s\nwhen they\u2019ve\nreally fleeced\nyou.\u201d\n\u201cJesus wept\u201d, and \u201cEmily HoxworthHoward stared longingly out of the bay\nwindow onto the harsh and unforgiving\nwild moor knowing one day she would\nfind that secret garden and frolic in the\nmorning dew\u201d, are well known as the\ntwo shortest sentences in the bible; this\nweek however I am going to talk about\nEdmonton, in North East London.\nI happened upon Edmonton by necessity and initially believed that I had\ninadvertently uncovered the remnants\nof a previously unreported nuclear\nholocaust as dishevelled individuals\ndrifted about town, plastic bags stuffed\ninto their pockets like sweets. It is surprising indeed how many busses are\nhappy to take you to the area, given\nthe fact that every driver is mugged on\naverage six times a day when driving\nthrough.\nArriving in Edmonton you may be\nlucky enough to catch a glimpse of the\nfabled Edmonton Seagull which prays\non the weak and infirm in the vicin-ity, carrying them off to the nearby\nrubbish dump so that they may be exchanged for fish and suchlike by the local council.\nThe MP for Edmonton is Andy Love\n(Labour), who ironically is notoriously\nnever in love. He did however oversee\nthe building of the new shopping complex in Edmonton Green which, I must\nadmit, was a good idea in that the removal of asbestos from children\u2019s lolly\nsticks in the 1970s was a good idea. In\norder for you to truly understand the\nmonstrosity that was the old Edmonton Green shopping complex you have\nto try to imagine what might happen\nif Jade Goody was given a vat of concrete and a set of instructions in Hindi,\nthen left for an hour to construct as\nshe pleased. As one walked into the\nold shopping mall, the overwhelming\nsense of foreboding that would envelop you would be powerful enough to\ncause you to panic and decide to buy\nan ill thought out bomber jacket. This\nwould be a decision you would regret\nlater in the day as you were held at\ngunpoint by the shop owner who had\npreviously sold you the coat.\nMoving away from the centre of\nEdmonton, it is conceivable that one\nmight decide to visit the Lee Valley\nLeisure Complex. This dear reader\nwould be a mistake. Never before has\nthe thought of visiting any one of 12\ncinema screens in one building sounded so unappealing. Firstly, the greatest\nmathematicians in the UK have not yet\ncalculated a route to the complex that\ndoesn\u2019t involve getting lost 7 times, 4\nof which end up with your car wedged\ninto the surrounding low-lying marsh-land. Once there, you are allowed to\npark a minimum of 2 miles away and\nmust walk the rest of the distance. In\nthe cinema itself, once the film has\nfinished, it is customary to leave your\nfootwear behind as it will be well and\ntruly stuck to the floor by indistinguishable sticky substances.\nEdmonton, in summary, is enough to\nmake Jesus weep.\nTravels\nwithout\nmy aunt:\nPart 3\nTheo Georgiou-Delisle\nHaggling in action.

Yes, Brian\nMay, Imperial\u2019s most stellar son (as far\nas rock goes anyway) had brought his\nflowing locks back to college, to tell a\nsold-out crowd of alumni about the\nsubject of his recently-awarded Ph.D.\n\u2013 apparently one of the first awarded\nby Imperial rather than the University\nof London.\nMany of you will know that the\nQueen guitarist went to Imperial, and\nwill have heard about the award, but\nmay have assumed that it was a mere\nhonorary degree, of the sort bestowed\nlike popcorn on the great and the good.\nCertainly not so in this case \u2013 May had\nin fact come very close to completing\nhis Ph.D. 30 odd years ago, before fame\nand fortune beckoned and he threw\nin the towel. But not irrevocably \u2013 he\nretained an interest in astronomy,\nformally rekindled in 2006 with the\npublication of \u201cBang! The Complete\nHistory of the Universe\u201d (reviewed in\nthese pages just over a year ago), which\nhe wrote with Patrick Moore and Chris\nLintott.\nWhilst promoting the book, he mentioned he was interested in revisiting\nhis thesis work, an aside which was\npicked up by Imperial\u2019s Prof. Michael\nRowan Robinson, who suggested May\nreturn to Imperial to complete the\noriginal thesis under him. But this was\nto be no easy ride \u2013 Rowan-Robinson,\ntestified to May\u2019s 3 a.m. emails complaining that completing his thesis was\n\u201ckilling [him]\u201d \u2013 a hallmark of any true\ndegree.

At its best, it can apparently be very bright, far more so that\nthe brightest regions of the Milky Way.\nEarly (recorded) observations include\nan ostensible sighting by Omar Khayyam, and an indubitable one by Cassini, who correctly attributed it due\nto dust orbiting the sun, mostly in the\nsolar system plane, and closer in than\nthe Earth. The light which scatters off\nthis cloud of dust means it is visible in\nthe night sky, at the times previously\nmentioned. At those times, an observer can look towards the centre of the\nsolar system without direct sunlight\ndrowning out the light reflected from\nthe dust.\nInterest in zodiacal dust apparently\ndwindled somewhat while May was\nout of the field (purely coincidentally,\nhe claimed), but has been invigorated\nin recent years by the discovery of\nsimilar dust clouds around other stars,\nas these clouds hold vital clues for how\nplanetary systems develop, and hence\nmay have implications for the presence\nof exoplanets around these stars, and\neven life itself.\nFortunately, this was not the question\nMay had set out to investigate initially,\nnor did he change course \u2013 as Prof.\nRowan-Robinson pointed out, catching up with 30 years of literature is no\nmean feat, even if one remains within\nthe narrow confines of a thesis topic.\nInstead, May stayed with his original\nwork, studying the motion and nature\nof the zodiacal dust around our own\nstar.\nThis involved studying a very small\npart of the reflected solar spectrum\n\u2013 a \u201cline\u201d or narrow frequency band\nof light, due to magnesium \u2013 using a\nsophisticated device known as a FabryPerot interferometer. Using a mirror\narrangement known as a coelostat to\ntrack the zodiacal light and reflect it\ninto the interferometer, May and his\ncolleagues could measure the wavelength of the magnesium line in this\nlight. By studying the difference between the measured wavelength and a\nreference value measured in the labo-ratory, they were able to determine\nthe speed of the dust. Light which had\nscattered off dust moving away from\nEarth was Doppler-shifted towards the\n\u201credder\u201d part of the spectrum, whilst it\nappeared bluer if the dust was moving\ntowards Earth.\nIn such a way, May was able to examine whether the dust was moving in\na prograde orbit \u2013 in the same direction around the sun as the Earth \u2013 or\na retrograde orbit, counter to Earth\u2019s\nmotion. Furthermore, by looking for\nasymmetries in the motion found in the\ndawn and dusk observations, he could\nalso look for evidence of a bulk flow\nrelative to the solar system \u2013 say due\nto our motion through the interstellar\nmedium, the cloud of material which\nour solar system ploughs through due\nto its orbit within our galaxy.\nAs with any Ph.D., the devil appeared\nto be in the detail, and more specifically in the details of work published\nby others in the field, as some of these\ndisagreed with May\u2019s findings. Nevertheless, his observations appeared\nto agree with a plausible theoretical\ncurve, and with enough previous liter-ature, that his examiners were satisfied\nby his conclusions: that a large proportion of the dust, which (as the name\nsuggests) is predominantly composed\nof small particles, is in a prograde or-bit, and that furthermore, there may be\nsome evidence for an interstellar flow.\nMay seems content to call it a day\nthere, and who can blame him? Returning to a field 30 years on and successfully completing Ph.D.-calibre\nresearch is cause enough to hang up\nones\u2019 laurels. Yet May retains a keen\ninterest in the area, and looks forward to the immensely detailed view\nof the zodiacal dust which IRAS, a\nspace-based infrared telescope, should\nshortly be providing. Much work has\nalready been done in this wavelength\nrange, as zodiacal light has typically\nbeen seen as light pollution interfering\nwith the study of more distant objects.\nHowever IRAS\u2019 contribution may help\nexplain the origin of the dust which is\nthought to arise, amongst other caus-es, from collisions between asteroids,\nand comets shedding their outer lay-ers. May noted that a good example\nof the latter was comet Holmes, which\nrecently graced our skies with a celestial fireworks display, suddenly brightening a million-fold as it blew off its\nouter layers, for no apparent reason.\nWho knows, maybe somewhere in the\nworld, a budding musician saw this\nand set down one instrument to pick\nup another, one more suited to studying the music of the spheres.\nEdmund Henley\nScience Editor\nMany thanks to Emma Jones for\nall her invaluable help\n\u201cCatching up\nwith 30 years of\nliterature is no\nmean feat\u201d\nMore than one string to his... guitar? That\u2019s Dr. Brian May to you son\n\n"

It was\nhere that he died, three years after receiving his knighthood.\nTHOMAS LANIER WILLIAMS III\n26 March 1911 \u2013 25 February 1983\nBetter known as Tennessee Williams,\nhe acquired the nickname whilst at\ncollege on account of his father\u2019s Tennessee background and his southern\ndrawl. Much of his work is said to have\nbeen inspired by his troubled family life; at five years old he contracted\ndiphtheria which rendered him paralysed from the hips down for two years.\nEncouraged by his mother, he took to\nwriting and making up stories. Another blown came following the mental\nhealth of his sister Rose, with whom he\nwas very close. Rose was schizophrenic\nand spent most of her time in mental\ninstitutions, as was the practice then.\nFinally it was decided that she undergo\na lobotomy, a procedure which left her\nincapacitated and possibly had the biggest influence on Tennessee, who later\nsuffered from alcoholism and depres-sion. He won Pulitzer prizes for his famous works A Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\nand A Street Car Named Desire. Williams finally died in 1983 after having\nchoked on an eye cap lid following supposed drinking and prescription drug\ntaking.\nARTHUR MILLER 17 October 1915\n\u2013 10 February 2005\nMiller was a Jewish- American play-wright, born into Manhattan but then\nbanished to Brooklyn following the\nWall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent failing of his father\u2019s clothes\nmaking business.

However, just like his companions - journalists and top scientists\nalike, he fails to produce a single piece\nof evidence to support his own claims.\nThese lazy, facile and wholly unscien-A response to\nlast week\u2019s letter\ncriticising Felix\u2019s\narticle on Dr\nWatson\nThis may sound a bit clich\u00e9 but...\ntific criticisms of Dr Watson highlight\na complete lack of understanding of the\nsubject they seem to claim complete\nknowledge of. Of course, Dr Watson\u2019s\ncomments were inaccurate, broad\nsweeping statements which many\nfound offensive and unhelpful, but as\nhis resignation letter shows they were\nclearly not motivated by racist views.\nMuch more importantly, the media\nreaction he elicited shows that there\nis indeed room for public debate and\na desperate need for public education on the subjects of normal human\nvariation and the effects that genetics\nand environment both have on human\nbehaviour.\nYours sincerely,\nRichard Fautley\nI\n\u2019m sorry, but \u2018too\u2019 objective? Too\nobjective? Perhaps I misread last\nweek\u2019s letters to Felix, or perhaps\nI was so overwhelmed by the as-shattery of complaining about\ntoo many fire drills when both Huxley\nand Blackett still both assemble in the\nwrong areas despite having so many\npractices, but the \u201ccomplaint\u201d about\nFelix\u2019s handling of the Dr. Watson issue\na couple of weeks back really seemed\nto take the piss.\nCalling the press \u2018too\u2019 objective when\nthey deal with an issue that\u2019s been\ntreated as a public bukkake of pure hatred by other publications seems to me\na bit like booking an appointment with\na student counsellor and then smacking their face in with a shovel for being\n\u2018too\u2019 caring.\nI have to fight back the gag reflex\nthat kicks in when I get my morning\npaper \u2013 the shit-filled, bile-basted tripe\nthat gets sprayed into newsagents on a\ndaily basis is physically sickening and\nthe fact that it remains so popular just\nangers me even more \u2013 dead or dying people, the fallen famous, and the\neternal blame game. These headlines\nthat never let up or disappear without\nsomething equally terrible appearing\nas breaking news elsewhere.\nWe were shocked at the horrific\nnews of the situation in Burma a few\nweeks ago, and it captured the attention of the world, uniting it in grief and\nanger against the inhumanity that was\ntaking place. Until a few days later, of\ncourse, when the news stories became\na bit samey and we decided to switch\noff and move back to the healthier dose\nof Eastenders and a shout at Gordon\nBrown.\nWe\u2019re fickle shits who couldn\u2019t give a\ntoss about what\u2019s really going on in the\nworld, happier to watch Big Brother\nand term is \u2018reality\u2019 because calling it\n\u2018reality\u2019 makes us think that we\u2019re not\nreally living, and so it\u2019s alright that all\nthat lies ahead of us is a quagmire of\nhealth, wealth and morality issues.\nWhile I understand the desires for another round of \u201cBash The Racist\u201d that\nno doubt prompted the letter to Felix, I\nhardly think you can complain when a\nmedia outlet decides to put the flaming\npitchfork down and say what actually\nhappened. Or did reading the news and\nmaking your own conclusions go out of\nfashion along with wearing clothes you\nfeel comfortable in, and the Pope?\nA quick check of the BBC News\nwebsite currently reveals the following\n\u2013 the top news story is that twenty-five\nmillion personal records were sent, un-encrypted, on two compact discs and\nThis just in \u2013 you all suck\nC\nlich\u00e9s have become an\nintrinsic part of our everyday language. Our con-versations, book titles,\nmovie clips and essays\nabound with them, and many have\nalready qualified to be ranked as idi-oms. Some may frown at that. Personally, I think that the clich\u00e9 has been\nmuch maligned, and deserves a second\nchance.\nIn ignoring clich\u00e9s, people tend to\nmiss the obvious question of why they\nbecame clich\u00e9s in the first place. Although we may have heard them often\nenough to cringe at the mere sight of\nthem, we have to spare a thought for\ntheir origins. Clich\u00e9s represent human collective wisdom pared down to\nits most memorable. The essence of\nself-help \u2013 nuggets of advice; though,\ngranted, as many are of the McDonalds variety as are of solid gold. They\ndid not spring out of nowhere \u2013 they\nare the result of generations of parents\nteaching their children the ways of the\nworld, eventually discovering simple,\ncatchy sentences as an effective medium to transmit knowledge.\nThe other day I heard someone express surprise when a clich\u00e9 someone\ntossed at him actually made sense.\nWhile I am not suggesting that we are\nall guilty of such misconceptions, I do\nthink that we tend to associate platitude with falseness or at least with ir-relevance, which is very much not the\ncase. Clich\u00e9s only become clich\u00e9s because people found them worthwhile\nenough to keep repeating. That\u2019s worth\nremembering.\nThere are disadvantages, however,\nand I would be the last to pretend that\nthere are none. The clich\u00e9 has a lot\nto answer for when it comes to making our conversations easier. It is almost impossible to express emotion\nwithout, quite simply, sounding corny\nand ridiculous. Let\u2019s take the most oft-described, if not the most ubiquitous\nemotion, Love. I feel guilty of unpardonable sentimentality for even writing the word. Imagine, then, talking\nabout the L word without sounding\nlike a character from a bad romantic\nnovel.\nI make this sound like a genuine\ncriticism. It\u2019s not. Or at least it is, but\nnot of the clich\u00e9. It\u2019s a criticism of us.\nMyself very clearly included. I mourn\nthe inability of my language to help me\nexpress my feelings, but in doing so I\ndo it a grave injustice. Our language;\nindeed, any language, is eminently\nsuited to expressions of sentiment. The\nproblem lies in being original enough\nto avoid the appealing clich\u00e9s which\nspring to mind most readily.\nThe greatest poetry comes from the\nexpression of human emotions in exactly the right words. Very few of us\nare poets, capable of anything more\nthan the crudest, most basic expressions of feeling. It\u2019s not a criticism of\nthe clich\u00e9, but rather a criticism of our\ncollective inability to be original. I still\ndefend the clich\u00e9, though \u2013 if only for\nbeing a valuable benchmark against\nwhich we can judge our poets. Nevertheless, I think that without them, noone would be tempted to move beyond\nmere triteness and unoriginality, and\nwrite tomorrow\u2019s poetry; and hence\nthe clich\u00e9s of the next generation.\nGilead Amit\nA. Geek\npromptly lost. A month ago, I might\nadd. Just under that, Imran Khan is\nfreed from his arrest in Pakistan, and\nseventy thousand birds are culled because of a fear of bird flu in Suffolk.\nThe most read stories, however, are\nas follows \u2013 a one-hundred-and-one\nyear-old woman stripping for charity;\na man having sex with a bike and jellyfish attacking some salmon. Fucking\nbrilliant. And if anything, it\u2019s the internet that\u2019s made us so fucking useless.\nThere was a time when the only people\nwho were stupid enough to fall for biased bullshit in the news were the ones\npicking up newspapers for Page Three.\nNow, even your average Green lunatic\nis falling for it.\nThe Independent have amused me\nnon-stop since becoming tabloid-sized, with headlines that are usually\non some variation of \u201cWe\u2019re All Going\nTo Die In A Blood Mess (And It Is The\nGovernment\u2019s Fault)\u201d with a picture of\nEarth on the front and either a giant\nmeteor, the sun burning a hole in it, or\njust Gordon Brown\u2019s face hurtling on a\ncollision course with it.\nThere\u2019s barely any point in reading\npast the headlines nowadays \u2013 shitty\npuns tend to give more of a clear news\nsummary than the actual body does,\nand once you get past the introductory\nparagraph you\u2019re knee deep in ridiculous and unnecessary social commen-tary.

Epically written in an immensely imaginative backdrop, Dan\nSimmons\u2019 book is a compelling read.\nHyperion takes place in the far future where Earth as we know belongs\nin the history books and mankind had\nspread across the galaxy, colonising\nplanets. An interstellar government\ncalled \u2018Hegemony of Man\u2019 rules the\ngalaxy and the colony planets. Hyperion begins with the Hegemony on the\nbrink of war with the Ousters, a group\nof separatist transhumanists who roam\naround the borders of the Hegemony\nWeb Worlds.\nAs the galactic war looms, seven\npilgrims set out on a journey to the\nmysterious time tombs on the planet\nHyperion to uncover the secrets of the\nuniverse. And to meet the Shrike; a\ngodlike killing machine with the ability\nto bend the laws of physics.\nThe pilgrims are warned that amidst\nthem, lies an Ouster agent.\nOn top of the tension between the\nHuman Hegemony and the Ousters,\nthe Technocore Artificial Intelligences are plotting mysterious schemes\nnot known to the Hegemony and the\nOusters.\nUsing frame narrative, the novel\nconsists of a main story; the pilgrim\u2019s\njourney and seven segments where the\npilgrims each take turn every night to\nrecount their tale and events that culminated in their participation in the\nvoyage. Each of their story introduces\nnew and startling insight into the\nevents, politics, worlds, and the technologies in the far future universe Dan\nSimmons has brilliantly envisioned.\nEach tale also serves as very personal\naccount into the pilgrim\u2019s character\nand thought. The pilgrims truly wore\ntheir heart on their sleeves as they retold their experiences. At the end of\neach pilgrim\u2019s tale, your perception of\nthem will be altered significantly \u2013 a\ntestament to Simmons\u2019 writing.\nThe tales are infused with plenty of\ndiscoveries and suspense to keep one\nreading on. The best part is of course\nthe revelations and puzzle pieces fitting together at the end of each account which makes the reader eager to\nget through with the story.\nThe group of pilgrims are made up\nof a priest with a heavy burden, a foul-mouthed poet who never ceases to\nspeak out his mind, a scholar and his\ninfant, a private detective, a Hegemony\nFORCE colonel, a Templar priest and a\nHegemony consul.\nDan Simmons created a myriad of\ntechnological wonders. In the World\nWeb,everyoneisconnectedtoavastinformation plane called the data sphere\nvia devices called comlog. Spaceships\nuse a technology with a reference to a\nwell-known physicist in our time. And\nthe farcaster portal which allows instant translation from world to world\nin the Web became the cornerstone\nof the Hegemony civilization. Some of\nthese technologies are run by the Technocore and its concepts are unknown\nto humans. These technologies do not\nprove to be all good as humankind had\nto pay a price for they dependency on\nthe Technocore.\nHyperion gives us a look at out attitude towards development and its effects on the natural state of the world in\none of the character\u2019s tale about a paradise world ravaged by development.\nBesides all the science fiction, there\nis humour here and there, mostly coming from the very expressive poet.\nDan Simmons drew inspiration from\nthe 18th century English Romantic\npoet, John Keats and his epic poem\n\u2018Hyperion\u2019, although Keat\u2019s influence\nbecome more prominent in the sequel\nto Hyperion, The Fall of Hyperion.\nHyperion has been hailed as a landmark work of science fiction in the 90\u2019s\nand it sure does lives up to its reputa-tion. It would appeal to fans of science\nfiction and high fantasy. It is a good\nread and an appealing dive into a future where man has traversed the galaxy and technological advances revolutionized the way we live.\nAuthor Dan Simmons, doing a photoshoot for the Littlewoods Winter Catalogue. Looking good, Dan.\nHyperion is available now and\nhas been for a few years\nArts needs you!\nFelix Arts is looking to regularly cover\nperformances, exhibitions, concerts and\nmore held by Imperial societies \u2013 but we\nneed you to keep us updated!

The idea behind this game is brilliant beyond\nbounds, overcoming obstacles and puzzles using mere holes in the space/\ntime continuum, taking leaps beyond the imagination of any other game creation that\nI for one have played. If you don\u2019t already have it, you\u2019re a total n00b. l2game.\u201d\n- Samuel Turnouff, 2nd Year, Computing\n\u201cPortal. What can I say? A breath of fresh air to what can be deemed a stagnating FPS genre. It\u2019s such a new\nexperience whacking down Portals here and there and it can take a bit to see how you solve the 3D puzzles using\nthis powerful new tool. Although once you get the Companion Cube rolling you\u2019ll soon be on your way to a delicious\nreward, but is the cake a lie?\u201d\n- James Finnerty, 2nd Year, Computing\n\u201cWhen it comes to Portal I\u2019ve heard numerous comments saying that it\u2019s too short. You\u2019re damn right it\u2019s too short! With\nentertainment this good, I demand there to be more! It\u2019s just as well, as modders will be all over this game.\u201d\n- Kris Machowski, 1st Year, Physics\n\u201cIt was a game that actually required you to think about what you were doing as opposed to mindlessly shooting.\u201d\n- Adam Rutherford, 1st Year, Biology\n\u201cIt\u2019s short because the first thirteen levels are basically tutorials leaving only six actual gameplay levels left.\u201d\n- Andrew Lim, 2nd Year, Computing\n\u201cPortal\u2019s somewhat of a milestone, showing that Valve\u2019s policy of finding talent, encouraging it and nudging it towards success pays off with awesome results.\u201d\n- Michael Cook, 2nd Year, Computing\nReader riposte: Portal to the public\nW\nhat really makes\ngaming special for\nme is how it can\nbring people together for a truly\ncommunal experience. Sessions like\nthese become exciting adventures that\nare saturated in equal amounts of cutthroat competition and cheering ca-maraderie. To celebrate that spirit, I\nthought it would be quite interesting\nif Felix Games opened up a section\nwhere readers from all over Imperial\nCollege are able to offer their comments - without regard for censure\n- on spotlight games.\nWhat Felix Games wants is\nfor you readers to be your-selves; there\u2019s no reason\nto be all professional\nor uptight. Offer your\nthoughts - whether\nthey be serious,\ncheesy, quirky or all\nof the above! Or you\ncould just pick out\nwhatever made you\nlove and/or hate\nthe game in ques-tion. Heck, you\ncould even write\nhaiku which would\nbe pretty damn\ncool and witty at\nthe same time. It\u2019s\nreally your canvas (if\na little limited in size,\nsorry) and I want you\nto draw on it.\nThis is a fantastic way\nto get involved with both\nFelix and the world of gam-ing; you don\u2019t have to write\nlengthy reviews or feature arti-cles. We\u2019ll just take a few words\nof your time and you can let the\nworld (or atleast, Imperial College\nstudents) know about your gaming critique in aperitif form.\nWhile this was basically a trial run;\nfor future submissions I\u2019ll have to be a\nlittle mean and ask that there be a word\nlimit of about 50 words. This means\nthat you can write absolutely anything\n- say, ten to twelve words - upto a total\nof fifty. I\u2019m also sorry to say that single word comments like \u201cAwesome\u201d or\n\u201ccrap\u201d or \u201cleet\u201d will have to be passed\non. I\u2019m sorry but they really don\u2019t say\nmuch.\nThe best way to know what games\nwill be focused on is to be part of the\nFelix Games mailing list. If you\u2019re not\npart of it then just hit me with an email indicating your desire\nto be placed in a list\nof truly distinguished\nluminaries at games.felix@imperial.\nac.uk.\nAlternatively, I\u2019ll indicate in some\nform as to what titles will be appearing\nin Felix Games for subsequent issues.\nHopefully we\u2019ll be running reviews for\nthe likes of Super Mario Galaxy, Call\nof Duty 4, Assassin\u2019s Creed, Crysis and\nMass Effect as time goes on.\nOf course, we\u2019re always open to reader submissions; don\u2019t hesitate to teleport to us a copy of your\nreviews for the\nabove,\nand any other, games that you fancy.\nBack to the ye olde rulebooke: I\nwould really appreciate it if I could get\nthe comments for Reader Riposte (and\nanother other material for that matter)\nby the Monday that precedes the Friday\nthat Felix is published. This is so that\nI can get enough time to organise the\nlayout properly and make sure each\narticle is done proper justice and isn\u2019t\njust relegated into a tiny corner with an\nequally tiny picture.\nSo, warm up MS-Word (or,\ngasp, pick up that pen)\nand start jotting down\nyour thoughts on\nthe wacky and\nwonderful\nworld of\ngaming.\nNow,\nshoo!\nAzfarul Islam thinks that you should speak up about the games that matter to you; enter Reader Riposte\nGairaigo Episode III: Katamari Damacy insanity\nGairaigo returns after an elongated\nhiatus to the chagrin of many and the\nsheer joy of some. This time we look at\na game that\u2019s not necessarily the latest,\nbut is definitely one of the quirkiest.\nKatamari Damacy\nEasily one of the most bizarre games\nI\u2019ve played in a while, Katamari was\nquick in establishing itself as a connoisseur of infantile surrealism.\nIt\u2019s a game that tasks you to do something that\u2019s an intrinsic impulse of the\ncurious toddler; roll any round object.\nHowever, there\u2019s more to it than just\nplaying with balls. The King of AllCosmos apparently got a little tipsy one\nnight and somehow managed to snuff\nout all the stars in the galaxy. Being the\ngreat monarch he is, it\u2019s upto you as his\nson to right his gigantic wrongs.\nTo that end you need to roll around\nthe magical katamari - a strange sphere\nthat has the ability to adhere any object,\nwithin relative size, to its being. The\nreason being that you need to build\nup a repertoire of solid matter that the\nKing will fuse together into a star.\nYou start quite small - with a diameter of a few centimetres - but as the\ngame wears on you quickly attain magnitude and it\u2019s not long before entire\ncities become part of your omnipotent\nmass. There are a myriad of items -most totally and utterly random - that\nare strewn about a level. You need to\nbe wary of what you pick up though.\nElongated objects will transfigure\nhow your Katamari rolls, fast, motive objects may knock items off your\nKatamari and obviously you want to\navoid trying to pick up the ladies until\nyou\u2019re a bit larger.\nYes, Katamari allows you to make\nhumans and other living creatures\nbecome but a stepping stone to your\nvoracious desire to rebuild the heav-Azfarul Islam\nStart small, think big\nKatamari is not available in the\nUK, although the sequels are\nens. While this does seem to effuse\nsubtly Stalinistic vibes, it\u2019s all wrapped\nin a wonderfully kaleidoscopic aura of\nsheer insanity.\nThe gameplay is strangely addicting\n- there\u2019s a certain sense of empowerment as you incorporate more and\nmore objects to your bulk. The visuals\nare technically quite inadequate but\ncompensate with sheer personality.\nSpecial mention must go to the incredibly eclectic soundtrack: it\u2019s one that\nwill make you hum the tunes a long\ntime after you\u2019ve finished playing.\nThe logical lunacy never falters:\nwhere else would you go about collecting crabs so that you can rebuild the\nCancer constellation?\nDespite there being sequels to this\ngame, I think the first one truly emanates a truly ebullient level of charm\nand iridescent joy.\nPortable\nAzfarul Islam\nPortal gets brilliant representation as\na flash-based title that takes the FPSbut-not-really and then scales it onto\nthe 2D plane. The genius still permeates throughout and the puzzles are\nfiendishly clever. You do need to apply\na level of forethought that\u2019s somewhat\ndifferent from the volumetric iteration.\nAs a teaser to the full package, the web\nedition is a tantalising tidbit.\n\n"

    "content": "39\nfelix\nFriday 23 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nThe long road to success\nGil Salville\nEnergia Fitness Instructor\nSports league\nSo you think you\u2019re ready to start training for a marathon? The marathon is\nthe longest and most difficult race most\nrunners ever attempt. It\u2019s also the most\npopular. Almost anyone can complete a\nmarathon, but whether they can complete it without injury or great pain is\nthe real test. Will you be one of those\nwho just manages through, or one of\nthose who finishes with a smile and a\ngreat outlook for the rest of the day?\nThe general rule is that you need to\nhave run regularly for 1 to 2 years before you begin training for a marathon.\nWhy the wait? A marathon is approximately 52,400 foot strikes. This will\ntear away at your body, especially your\njoints. Your body needs to build up to\nthis kind of abuse and a 26 week (or\nless) training program just doesn\u2019t suffice for most people\u2019s bodies to adapt\nproperly. You will need to find some\nruns that you like in your area that suit\nyour current fitness level. It may be\n1, 2, 5 even 10 mile runs that you are\ncurrently doing. Aim to have as many\ndifferent routes and distances, with the\naim of avoiding just going out for a run\naround the block. By simply going out\non the same run each time, you will\nsoon get bored and your body will become adapted to it. Vary your routes,\nthe way in which you run round and\nspeed. Keep a log of your times.\nIt is advisable to put in at least 20\nmiles per week for several months before you start training for a marathon.\nThe reasons are the same as those\nabove. Your body needs time to adapt\nto the pounding that it will be taking.\nBe sure to run at least 5 miles a week\nduring this time on pavement, as that\nis likely to be what you are running on\nin the marathon. Training solely on\na track or trail will cause you to hurt\nmuch worse after the marathon.\nIt\u2019s also a good idea to try out a few\nsmaller races, like 5ks or 10ks, even a\nhalfmarathon(assumingyou\u2019vetrained\nfor it). This is important because there\nare many new experiences that races\nbring that regular training does not.\nIf you haven\u2019t raced before you start\ntraining, be sure to work some into\nyour schedule. Choosing a full marathon as your first ever race is a sure fire\nway to have a tough 26.2 miles!\nIt may not seem important, but a\ngreat way to get injured is to think you\ncan just start running long distances\nwithout the proper time and effort.\nJust like speed takes years of training\nfor many people, distance isn\u2019t something you just jump into. It\u2019s important\nto respect the distance (and your body)\nby allotting the time you really need.\nIf you are looking for instant-gratifi-cation, try a 5k. Marathons are about\npatience, including before the starting\nline.\nIt\u2019s important to think about what\nrace you plan to do. Very hot or very\ncold weather is not a great marathon\nto start with. You\u2019re limiting your\nchances of finishing. The same could\nbe said about a very hilly course or a\ncourse that is not beginner-friendly.\nFind races that advertise they are good\nfirst marathons, like the Free Scale\nMarathon. Training in the UK for the\nLondon marathon will normally take\nplace in the cold wet winter months for\nthe race in April. This prevents most\npeople going out, especially in the evenings when it gets dark so early.\nIf you are going to ignore my advice\nabout putting in a year or more of running regularly before you start train-ing, tell your doctor what your plan is,\nperhaps go over the training schedule\nyou plan to do with him/her. They may\nsuggest tests (like a cardiovascular\nstress test), give you an alternate plan,\nor just send you on your way to get\nstarted. There is no reason why someone of an average to good fitness level\nshould not be able to run the whole\nway of a marathon. Prepare both your\nbody and mind, and you will finish.\nIf your goal is weight loss, and you\nthink that marathon training is the way\nto get there, you are probably headed\ndown a path to injuries. While you may\nlose some fat while training for a mara-thon, marathons and dieting are a bad\nmix. Your body will need nourishment\nnow more than ever. Eating healthier,\nbut not having much of a calorie defi-cit, will help you tone up and yes lose\nsome during marathon training, but\nyour major focus needs to be completing the marathon in good health.\nTips for success ... on long runs drink\nwater before you run, not too much so\nas to make you uncomfortable, and sip\nwater during the run. Don\u2019t get thirsty.\nDuring the marathon you will have\navailable isotonic drinks. They are useful for replacing salts and sugar. If you\nintend to use them train with them. Eat\na well balanced, sensible diet. You may\nfind that as the training increases you\neat more. Increase the carbohydrate\ncontent with rice, pasta, bread and\npotatoes. Wear the right shoes and kit\nthat is comfortable. If you pick up an\ninjury then stop. RICE! Rest. Ice. Compression. Elevation. Don\u2019t start back\ntoo early with your training. A heart\nrate monitor is a good investment.\nYou will know exactly what your body\nis doing and how it is reacting to the\ndemands. Run at approximately 75% of\nyour maximum which is simply (220 \u2013\nage) x 75/100. Intervals help to improve\nyour fitness and increase your pace.\nRun them at a pace that means you can\ncomplete the session. For 1 minute efforts recover for 1 minute with a walk.\nOn race day don\u2019t do anything different\nto your Sunday routine. Training is all\nabout preparing the body and mind to\nachieve what it understands.\nBest tip of all - Don\u2019t forget to set your\nalarm clock on the day of the race!!\nWeek 7 and a lot more results are in.\nThe ranking of the teams is based on\nthe Felix Index (FI), which is calculated\nas follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) \u2013 (L*4).\nOnly teams with 5 games or more will\nbe considered in the overall championship at the end of year.\nWith this week\u2019s results in, Netball 1st, Squash Men\u2019s 1st and Tennis\nMen\u2019s 2nd are top of the table with 25\npoints each. With the majority of the\nchasing pack wiinning their games this\nweek, there is very little change except\nfor Fencing Women\u2019s 1st who at their\nweekend tournament came second,\nonly losing out to Oxford.\nA mid table scrap is still there between the men\u2019s Hockey 2s and Rugby\n3s, as well as the ladies Hockey, Lacrosse and Squash\nAt the bottom of the table the Football Men\u2019s 2nd are rooted and are still\nlooking for that elusive BUSA. Hopefully they\u2019ll get it next week.\nTeam P W D L F A Diff % FI\n1 Netball 1st 6 6 0 0 344 152 192 100 30\n2 Squash Men's 1st 6 6 0 0 30 0 30 100 30\n3 Tennis Men's 2nd 6 6 0 0 51 9 42 100 30\n4 Rugby Union Men's 1st 7 6 0 1 171 61 110 85.7 26\n5 Squash Men's 2nd 6 5 0 1 20 8 12 83.3 21\n6 Fencing Men's 2nd 4 4 0 0 525 423 102 100 20\n7 Hockey Men's 1st 6 4 1 1 17 9 8 66.7 18\n8 Rugby Union Men's 2nd 6 4 1 1 139 77 62 66.7 18\n9 Tennis Women's 1st 4 3 1 0 30 10 20 75 17\n10 Football Men's 1st 5 2 3 0 9 4 5 40 16\n11 Volleyball Women's 1st 3 3 0 0 9 3 6 100 15\n12 Fencing Women's 1st 4 3 0 1 517 403 114 75 11\n13 Football Women's 1st 5 2 2 1 4 3 1 40 10\n14 Basketball Men's 1st 2 2 0 0 151 96 55 100 10\n15 Squash Women's 1st 6 3 1 2 16 9 7 50 9\n16 Cricket Men's 1st 5 3 0 2 926 678 248 60 7\n17 Lacrosse Women's 1st 5 3 0 2 38 35 3 60 7\n18 Hockey Women's 1st 6 2 2 2 21 19 2 33.3 6\n19 Table Tennis Women's 1st 3 2 0 1 9 6 3 66.7 6\n20 Rugby Union Women's 1st 1 1 0 0 50 5 45 100 5\n21 Hockey Men's 2nd 6 3 0 3 27 12 15 50 3\n22 Rugby Union Men's 3rd 6 3 0 3 128 92 36 50 3\n23 Cricket Men's 2nd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n24 Equestrian 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n25 Equestrian 2nd 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n26 Golf 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n27 Volleyball Men's 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n28 Water Polo Men's 1st 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n29 Hockey Men's 3rd 6 2 1 3 10 10 0 33.3 0\n30 Badminton Men's 2nd 5 2 0 3 21 19 2 40 -2\n31 Table Tennis Men's 1st 3 1 0 2 30 21 9 33.3 -3\n32 Squash Men's 3rd 1 0 0 1 1 2 -1 0 -4\n33 Badminton Men's 1st 6 2 0 4 23 22 1 33.3 -6\n34 Hockey Women's 2nd 6 2 0 4 8 29 -21 33.3 -6\n35 Fencing Men's 1st 4 1 0 3 429 466 -37 25 -7\n36 Netball 2nd 4 1 0 3 115 116 -1 25 -7\n37 Tennis Men's 1st 6 1 1 4 16 44 -28 16.7 -9\n38 Hockey Men's 4th 5 1 0 4 4 14 -10 20 -11\n39 Badminton Women's 1st 5 0 1 4 10 30 -20 0 -14\n40 Football Men's 3rd 6 0 1 5 4 18 -14 0 -18\n41 Football Men's 2nd 5 0 0 5 3 18 -15 0 -20\nThe winner of last week\u2019s crossword\nwas nobody, unfortunately.

Despite\nthe piercing cold, the IC Women\u2019s\nFootball had come to play. Everyone\nseemed en form and injury free, particularly Lily! The team started warming up on the astro, waiting for the\nBedfordshire, Luton girls. These were\nexpected to be quite rough, given their\nlocality. The IC girls were therefore not\ndisappointed when they saw 14 beasts\narrive. The IC ladies, for their part, had\nonly come with a reduced formation of\n8 equipped players plus one! Luckily\nfor IC however, Pav finally found some\nboots and shin pads to play with and\nbrought the number of players back to\n9. The Luton girls smiled as they saw\nthe reduced IC team, sure to come\naway with a victory.\nThe first 20 minutes went on great\nfor IC, with good charges up the field\nand a comfortable pace. The Luton\ngirls obviously were not sure what\nthey had to do. With the exception of\ntheir two forwards, it seemed that their\nteam was mostly composed of ran-domers picked up in the street. Everywhere the ball went, at least three or\nfour red Luton jerseys followed. It was\nlike watching 3 year-olds play football.\nThe ref, Richie P. therefore had a hard\njob of seeing what was happening. Pav,\nmade a few breakthroughs, supported\nby Steph and Barbara. The defence remained solid, passing accurately and\nretaining possession of the ball. The\nfirst goal came in at the 17th minute.\nAn absolutely brilliant shot from Lily\nat the edge of the box, which flew over\nat least three or four of their defenders\nbefore landing in the left corner of the\ngoal. The goalie, who did not appear to\nFootball\nImperial Women\u2019s 1st 1\nBedfordshire Women\u2019s 1st 1\nChloe Joyeux\nbe very skilled or bright, did not realise\nwhat was happening.\nThe victory was not long lived how-ever. As a result of their fewer numbers\nof players, the IC girls started becoming slightly tired. This was not made\nbetter by the constant shouting of their\nmanager on the side line and the out-of-place comments of their \u201csupporters\u201d. Steph therefore took the liberty\nof asking the manager to be quiet, to\nwhich he replied \u201cI am the f****** manager you b****! You suck anyway!\u201d in a\ncomplete lack of sportsmanship. Steph\nbecame red with fury but managed to\navoid strangling him for fear of being\nshot by the opposition. Luton took this\nopportunity and equalised minutes before half time. The shot was, one must\nadmit, perfectly placed. Emily jumped\nbut the ball passed right out of reach\nbetween her hands and the cross-bar.\nHalf time was welcome by both\nteams. Steph related her \u201cbeef of the\nweek\u201d to the team, stating that the\n\u201cmanager\u201d of the opposition had a\nmental age of 5 and she couldn\u2019t play\nbecause his fake gold teeth blinded her.\nIn a more serious tone, Squashie gave\nthe IC girls a full report, insisting on\nshort passes and playing wide.\nThe second half started with a Luton girl trying to come onto the pitch\nwith her jacket, before being told off\nby Richie P. It went on at a quick pace\nstraight away, giving everyone little\nchance to breathe. Sheryl, now center\nmid nevertheless kept the beasts at\nlarge, keeping them out of the center.\nThe going forward movement of the\nIC ladies improved, resulting in Pav\nnearly scoring a late goal. Despite Luton girls having several forward runs,\nEmma, Chloe and Kate closed the de-fence, leaving them without any shots\non goal. Other events in the second\nhalf also included several IC ladies\nbeing fouled a few times, particularly\nby their wide number 10, and the absolute warrior behaviour of Emma.\nEmma seemed to be everywhere and\nsaved the day more than a few times.\nAs a result, I am taking the liberty of\nnaming her woman of the match! The\nIC ladies took the coach home with a\nhappy feeling of accomplishment and\nthe conclusion that Luton town must\nbe a rough place!\nWow, nine of them in this one!\nOn Friday 26th October a full contingent of Imperial kayakers left London\nand headed for the Hut. After reclaiming a fresher who had got on the wrong\nbus, we got to Snowdonia by midnight-ish. On Saturday morning, post fry up,\nwe had a dilemma: no water. No water\nmeans no paddling.\nThe Tryweryn and Vyrnwy were no-gos. The Dee, however, was low but\nrunning. A few of the freshers swam\non a section called the \u2018Serpents tail\u2019,\nbut soggy toes aside it was awesome.\nDreams of some slalom fun were\nshattered by the BCU Open Slalom\nChampion getting to Town Falls first.\nUndeterred, we missioned over to the\nGlaslyn gorge, which was run by the\nmore experienced paddlers for a few\nmore thrills.\nThe evening consisted of the pub\nin Beddgelert, chilli and drinking in\nthe hut. Halloween was celebrated in\nICCC style with glow in the dark skel-etons, Tesco Value face paint and black\nnail varnish (on boys).\nOn Sunday morning all prayers of\novernight rain had been answered.\nThe rivers were crazily high \u2013 even\nthe boathouses on the lake above the\nGlaslyn were underwater. The keen\npaddlers went on an early morning\nmission t a river no-one can pronounce\n(the Afon Nantygwyrd) and came back\ngrinning. After their return, some van\npacking and a fry up, everyone headed\nto the Conwy. There were a few swims\nbut Hargreave\u2019s Folly was run by most.\nMost of the freshers got out by the A5\nroad bridge. The rest of the paddlers\nran the second half. Then it was back\nto Llangollen for fish and chips, and\nback to the real world by 11pm Sunday\nIC Canoe club go kayaking on freshers trip\nCatherine Charter night.\nImperial Canoe Club holds pool sessions every Tuesday at Ethos, 7 til 8.30,\nusually followed by a drink or two. We\nhave various trips to Wales and the\nLakes, and a big summer trip to the\nAlps. Membership is only \u00a330, and includes all the gear you need. For more\ninformation, go to www.union.ic.ac.\nuk/rcc/canoe or email rachel.fox@\nic.ac.uk.\nThe day started off with IC 4ths, 5ths\nand 6ths boarding a coach to Shenley\nthe sports ground of UCL and their\nrespective medics, RUMS. For those\nof you unaware of where Shenley is,\nit is where Watford have their training ground and is a ridiculous distance\naway from central London so we were\nlucky we had 3 teams playing there on\nthe same day, enabling us to get the\naforementioned coach instead of the\nusual tube, train, taxi combination\nwhich takes about 2 hours and is one\nof the most frustrating journeys since\nthe Titanic\u2019s inaugural launch from\nSouthampton.\nAnyway the match started off on\ntime with both teams ready for battle.\nThe opening exchanges went against\nwhat the league table would suggest,\nwith RUMS seemingly more up for the\ngame and their midfield and winning\nthe key challenges. It was also a very\nscrappy game both teams restricted to\nhopeful punts downfield and long shots\nat goal. It was one of these scrappy attempts in the 40th minute that resulted\nin the opening goal. The RUMS midfielder pumped the ball into the box,\nleaving AD and Matthew to wrestle\neach other off the ball while the RUMS\nstriker showed the predatory skills of a\ngreat white shark to wade in and stab\nthe ball home from 5 yards.\nThis was the kick in the arse IC needed to start playing some of our beautiful football to try and get a foothold in\nthe game and before halftime we had\nequalised. Dave the right-back tackled\ntheir player from a throw-in and the\nball bobbled through to AD in midfield.\nHe had the space and vision to play an\nerotic ball through the centre-backs to\nRob who was steaming in from the left-wing. Rob then showed great composure to control the ball with one touch\nthen nutmeg the keeper with his next.\n1-1 at half-time and game on.\nThe second-half started and it was\nRUMS again who started the half\nthe better team, but fortunately they\nweren\u2019t as good at creating chances\nas we were and within 10 minutes we\nscored to take IC 2-1 up. The goal was\na thing of beauty, involving Ricky darting out of defence like the title character of peter benchleys second masterwork after the jaws, called \u201cthe beast\u201d\nabout a colossal squid attacking a seaside community. He skinned three of\ntheir players before passing the ball off\nto AD, who again noticed Rob breaking\ndown the left wing. AD played in Rob\nwho showed great skill in beating the\ndefender and getting the shot off. Their\nkeeper exhibited his lettuce wrists and\nonly succeeded in palming the ball to\nthe rushing striker Killer, who calmly\nslotted away the goal.\nIt was at this point the RUMS player\nturned referee decided to start trying\nhis best to upset our rhythm by refusing to give any decisions for us and\nconstantly giving free-kicks to RUMS.\nThe pressure began to mount and this\nculminated in the ref awarding a penalty when the RUMS striker was tackled\nand he flopped to the ground like the\nworlds largest jellyfish. You\u2019re \u2018avin a\nGiraffe we all thought but our wails of\nprotest were to no avail as the ref stood\nfirm, despite the fact it was an absolute\ndive and a blatant lie\u2026 GRRRRR would\nbest sum up our feelings at this point.\nAnyway we had to be professional\nand accept the decision. This acceptance was made all the more easier by\ntheir striker running up and taking an\nawful penalty. Straight down the middle and into the grateful hands of C.Y\nthe \u2018keeper.\nShortly after the penalty save, the final whistle went and we were happy to\nleave Shenley with all 3 points after a\nbelow-par performance. But points will\nhopefully become prizes by the end of\nthe year if we can continue this good\nform and keep our position within the\npromotion places.\nFootball\nImperial Men\u2019s 6th 2\nRUMS Men\u2019s 3rd 1\nAdrian Doyle\n\n"

Every year, we go forth to compete for glory and above all, boasting\nrights in various sports like football,\nfloorball, basketball, netball, ultimate\nFrisbee, badminton etc. Competition\nwas always strong at the Notts Games,\nbut this year was going to be something special for us.\nThe games were held throughout the\nwhole campus of the university and\nonce we arrived, we started on our respective games. As usual, our 2 floorball teams hit the floor running, one\nemerging victorious in all their games\nand the other only losing one, drawing\nanother and winning all the rest. As a\nresult, we emerged champions and 2nd\nrunner-up in floorball.\nIn ultimate Frisbee, we managed to\nclinch 1st runner-up spot after facing stiff competition from the other\nuniversities. Though emotions ran\nhigh during in the final due to several controversial foul calls, the team\nstill played in the spirit of the game,\nexhibiting great composure and level-headedness.\nFootball, being one of the most\npopular sports, had a great number\nof teams and it was a long, hard road\nthrough the group stages. Some of the\nteams were more interested in wrestling than playing proper football but\nwe still managed to top our group and\ngo onto the quarter-finals. We faced\nLSE, whom we promptly dismissed\nwith a 4-0 scoreline and then went on\nto the semis. Unfortunately, we lost to\nBristol and had to settle for 2nd run-ner-up spot after beating Sheffield in\na scintillating game that ended 5-4 in\nour favour.\nSquash has always been one of our\nmain sources of medals and in this,\nWong Chong Wai did not disappoint\nus. He managed to come in 1st runner\nup in Squash Men\u2019s Singles, doing us\nproud once again. Two other players,\nAndrew Jasudasen and Rajeev Rikhye\nfought valiantly but missed out narrowly on getting a medal.\nBridge was also one of the competitive sports at the Notts Games and\nwe proved ourselves to be more than\nadept at this thinking man\u2019s game. The\npairs of Tan Xuan You and Koh Yahting bested others to come in 1st runner up and so did Xue Kun and Ang\nChieh Hwee as they came in a close\n2nd Runner-up.\nIn Chess, Low Yu Bin also did not go\nhome empty-handed as he achieved a\n2nd runner-up position.\nIt seemed that we could not stop\nwinning something in almost every\nsport and indeed, there was still more\nto come. In Men\u2019s Singles Tennis, Lim\nZhiyang showed off his racket skills,\ndominating all his opponents to come\nin eventual champion. The Men\u2019s DouSingaporean Society haul medals in Nottingham\nJiaxuan Lu\nbles pairing of Boris Iskandar and Lionel Wong also gave the rest a run for\ntheir money, clinching 2nd runner-up.\nIn Basketball, Badminton and Netball, we put up a fight from start to\nfinish but were unlucky to come away\nwithout anything.\nIn terms of overall standings, Imperial College came in an unprecedented 2nd runner up after all the points\nwere tallied. This added to an already\nburgeoning harvest of medals and we\ncould claim to be a sporting force to be\nreckoned with in the next Nottingham\nGames.\nAfter gaining so many accolades to\nour name, waking up at 5am was well\nworth it.\nUltimate frisbee\nWong Chong Wai with his squash medal\n\n"

    "content": "30 felix Friday 23 November 2007\nT\nhe idea for this expedition\ncame about from a desire\nto climb new rock routes\nin a remote location. The\nQuimsa Cruz area was\nsuggested to us by some UKClimbing.\ncom users who had visited it before and\nfound that there was a lot of potential\nin the area. Our general aim was\nto climb new rock routes. Five\nstudents chose to take part:\nHal Watts, Markus Roggan, Bernard Lam, Ben\nWithers and myself.\nWe waddled out\nfrom the MountaineeringClub\nequipment\nstores in\nBeit Quad\nlike a\ngroup\nof\npregnant penguins (if such a thing\nwere to exist); we were mildly late for\nour flight to Bolivia and we were laden\nwith enough gear to kill a medium-sized donkey. Thankfully we made it\nwith time to spare. We had to spend\nthe night in Santa Cruz airport to catch\nour connecting flight; so we ate at Subway for about \u00a31 each, and then found\na comfy spot to sleep in the airport,\nwhich happened to be under a dozen\nTVs that soothed us with lovely traditional Bolivian pan-pipe music. All\nnight long. We came close to putting\nan ice axe through the TVs.\nIn La Paz we spent a few days buying\nsupplies and acclimatising. The supermarket employees pointed and laughed\nat us when we bought four shopping\ntrolleys of food, and the kids that\nhelped us pack the groceries grinned\nfrom ear to ear when we inadvertently\ngave them a humungous tip.\nThe jeeps arrived early in the morn-ing; we loaded them up and set out\ntowards the mountains. The driver\nclaimed to be called Jose but drove\nmore like McRae. We swept around\ntight hairpins, disturbingly close\nto sheer drops. We traversed\nseveral turquoise lakes and\npassed through a number of\nsmall farming and mining settlements, some\nof them abandoned\nand decaying. After about eight\nhours we were\nabruptly\ngreeted by\nthe moun-tains.\nOverthe\nfollowing\nAdventures in the Andes\nVirgil Scott and 4 others from Mountaineering Club went to the Quimsa Cruz mountain range\nin Bolivia in July to climb new routes and explore the area, looking for rock climbing potential\nweeks we attempted to climb as many\nroutes as possible:\nSunday 1 July\nOn the first day our plan was to go for\na short walk \u2013 exploring the nearby\narea. We didn\u2019t want to push our luck\nwith the altitude by doing anything\ntoo strenuous. We followed the river\nup the valley, and then branched off\nnorth to the Col leading to the next\nvalley in which we would later put our\nsecond advanced camp. Standing on\ntop of the col gave a stunning view of\nthe next valley, exposing the enormous\nsouth faces on the opposite side of\nthe valley. It was oozing with soaring\ncrack-lines, hundreds of metres long\nreaching striking pinnacle summits, no\ndoubt most, if not all of them, are un-climbed because they do not get much\nsun compared to the mass of rock op-posite. From the Col we could also see\nIllymani \u2013 the highest mountain in Bolivia. After spending some time enjoying the views we scrambled to summit\nof the peak to the east of the Col.\nMonday 2 July\nIn the evening we carried bivouac gear\nfor three nights to the east of Laguna\nBlanca near the base of Nevada Saturno. On the way up the valley we met\nsome min- ers coming down\nfrom the mines on the\nsouth side of the valley. They wore dark\ncotton clothing, with either a woollen\nhat or a baseball cap and carried rucksacks with thin cord for straps. Each\nmorning, at around 8am they would\nwalk past our base camp, about an\nhour and a half from Viloco up to the\nmines, whilst we would barely be out\nof bed until sunrise (9:30am) because\nit was so cold until then. They were\nhardy and jovial \u2013 they always greeted\nus cheerfully and asked about what we\nwere doing or where we were going.\nTuesday 3 July\nWe split up into two groups, Bernard\nand Ben set off to the north to find a\nclimb near the Col next to Saturno.\nHal, Markus and I set off east to take\na look at the south side of Saturno and\nthe surrounding area. There appeared\nto be several good lines up the south\nside of Saturno, however since they\nwere all in the shade we decided to attempt a line on the north facing slabs\nopposite Saturno. We inspected the\nfaces and found several attractive lines,\na couple of overhanging crack-lines to\nthe east, some blank vertical slabs to\nthe west, and up the middle was a large\nrightward curving crack, this looked to\nbe the easiest line, and since it was our\nfirst climb we decided it would be best\nnot to push ourselves too much. As it\nturned out we did push ourselves too\nmuch, we had totally misjudged the\ntop pitch and it turned out to be an exciting section of steep, dirt-filled crack.\nAs we were not really in a position to\nclean it, the climb turned into a constant struggle against the flow of dirt\ndown the crack. The dirt and shrubs\nwould gradually slide down the crack\nand so the climbing involved attempting to move faster than the dirt was\nsliding. Stopping to catch your breath\nwould give you an alarming feeling of\nbeing in sinking sand \u2013 as your hands\nand feet would begin to move down-wards, so we called this route E-dirt.\nBen and Bernard found a climb to the\nnorth-west of Saturno, a long scramble\nwhere everything was loose. and it was\nsoon clear that it would be very late\nbefore they would return. They finished their route late in the afternoon,\njust before dark, and returned to base\ncamp just before midnight.\nWednesday 4 July\nRest day.\nThursday 5 July\nWe moved up to the Laguna Blanca\ncamp early in the morning. Markus\nand I explored the area to the north\nand north-west of Laguna Blanca. We\nplanned to do a route on the slabs to the\nnorth of the lake but upon inspection it\nappeared excessively dirty and had evidence of being climbed so instead we\ncontinued further west and then north\nup a gulley to check out the wall that\njoined the ridge parallel to the next\nvalley. Bernard and Ben explored the\nslabs below the headwall to the northeast of Laguna Blanca scrambling up a\n\u201cThe driver\nclaimed to be\ncalled Jose but\ndrove more like\nMcRae\u201d\nThis looks highly dangerous!

First there were the competition-hungry bastards at Dreamworks. Then\nthe slightly pitiful attempts by 20th\nCentury Fox. Then dead silence, because the film-going audiences were so\nappalled at what was being produced\n\u2013 and I don\u2019t care if you thought the\nIce Age squirrel thing was funny; you\u2019re\nwrong \u2013 that no-one could be bothered to work out what generic settings\nhadn\u2019t been done already. Cartoon for-est. Cartoon garden. Cartoon toybox.\nThat\u2019s enough to fill the coffers for a\nlittle longer.\nThank goodness, then, for Beowulf,\nwhich brings CGI slap bang into the\nmodern market (naturally, I discard\nanything Squaresoft did as pissing into\nthe wind). If Felix has already covered\nthe film, then you\u2019ll know it\u2019s a rage fest\nof the disembodied voice of Ray Winstone beating the shit out of stuff, and\nAngelina Jolie getting naked. If they\nhaven\u2019t covered the film, then frankly\nyou probably know all you need to to\nmake you go and see it.\nNaturally, the move to computer\ngraphics is a big one for a studio whose\nlargest decision generally is where to\nget rid of the leftover millions of dollars each film seems to leave cluttering\nup the offices, but looking at all of the\nfancy graphics, lovely trailers and completely semi-legal clips from it, this\nhorrible realisation dawns on you that\nthey\u2019ve not so much set out to make a\nCGI film as they have just put CGI in\nwherever they couldn\u2019t be bothered to\ndo it with real people. Which just happens to be everywhere.\nI mean, Angelina Jolie\u2019s character\nlooks like Angelina Jolie. Ray Winstone, admittedly, looks considerably\nmore do-able than he does normally,\nbut that\u2019s not really a good reason to\nstart doing everything up in 3DSMax\nnow, is it? It\u2019s a little disconcerting, because it\u2019s beginning to make me think\nthat maybe Dreamworks had it right all\nalong, and that derivative cartoon fantasy lands might be the safe option. After all, rehashing Looney Tunes isn\u2019t so\nbad, because that was actually good in\nthe first place. As it is, I\u2019m stuck staring\nat Angeline with a tail, while the most\nrepulsive Cockney of all time gets naked on screen.\nChrist. Bring back the squirrel.\nAngry Geek\nAlex Casey\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if\nyou thought the\nIce Age squirrel\nthing was funny;\nyou\u2019re wrong\u201d\nHubris or not hubris, Beowulf asks\nWith controversy flying at murmurs of\nplot tampering and computer graphics abound in this adaptation of the\nOld English classic, Beowulf is waging\na knowing war on tradition. Expectations aren\u2019t high; yet somewhere in\nthis digital mesh of effects, Beowulf\nlaunches an onslaught of innuendo and\ntongue-in-cheek references that questions everything we hold sacred about\nthe classics.\nIs it better that a film hold its hands\nup at the start and say \u201cWe used com-puters, here\u2019s the result\u201d than to try\nand include it seamlessly leading to infuriated \u2018serious\u2019 filmgoers clearing the\ncinema? Robert Zemeckis certainly\nseems to think so, sacrilegiously replacing poetry with pixels. Or so the public\noutcry would seem to imply. Why are\nold words not to be subjected to modern storytelling methods? Assuming\nyou can live with this, helped by the\nknowing nods that Beowulf makes to\nits unconventional rebirth, this can be\na suprisingly enjoyable film.\nHubris seems to be the order of the\nday with the bounty of bosoms on\nshow in the early half laying the scene\nfor a tale of temptation that adds a hell\nof a lot more sex than originally was\ntranslated from the Old English text,\nat least in the Seamus Heaney ver-sion. The faultless hero of our poem\nis now just as interested in getting his\nleg over as he is in protecting the Danish kingdom of Hrothgar from the evil\nGrendel and its mother. The effect of\nthis is a curious and intriguing mesh\nthe original Beowulf tale and the creation of an almost Shakespearean tragic\nhero, haunted by lust, but still there is\nnot as much bastardising as expected.\nIt does seem he is in good company\nthough, as it seems the other men in\nMiddle Ages Denmark can\u2019t keep it in\ntheir pants for more than a few minutes at a time either. Anyone who has\nvisited Copenhagen recently probably\nunderstands that, even though this\nwas 1300 years ago, this is simply due\nto a lack of entertainment on offer. But\nthen they should still have been concentrating more on Grendel slaying in\nthose days.\nThe humour here is the means by\nwhich Zemeckis assuages the crowd\nof academics baying for blood. Austin\nPowers-like moments near the begin-ning, both the comic obscuring of Beowulf\u2019s cock and the randy Geat trying\nto get a \u2018gobble\u2019 outside the hall, work\nwonders at loosening up the tough\ncrowd and keeping tongue placed\nfirmly in cheek throughout reassures\nthe die hard literati that this at no\npoint claimed to be a faithful retelling\nof Britain\u2019s oldest written work.\nIn order to throw some real controversial films into the mix here however,\nthe fact is that Angelina Jolie is becoming so unsexy it hurts. As a beautiful\nwoman with an exotic Amazonian look\nabout her, you\u2019d think she might be sexy\njust by being. But no, when Hollywood\nrequires a temptress, they get Ange on\nthe phone and she negotiates skin time\nand begins method acting with whoev-As the oldest piece of literature known to have originated in Britain comes back to the cinema screen, Felix\ninvestigates whether the CGI treatment and bags of boobs are a dumbing down of the classic poem\ner she\u2019s costarring with. Demi Moore\ndid a similar thing whereby every role\nshe chose for a while revolved around\nsex but they at least had the decency to\ngive her a different character side that\nmade her seem slightly na\u00efve. Here\nJolie is supposed to be playing the\nmother of the most hideous creature\non Earth, and with three kids or something on the roster you might want to\ntone down the nude scenes with excessive gold body paint and tail, albeit\ncomputer generated.\nElsewhere it\u2019s the role of Robin\nIn the days where everything is cheaper with CGI, has it all gone too far?\nThere\u2019s something brilliantly consistent about the majority\u2019s ability to take\nsomething nice and just smear faeces\nall over it. There\u2019s democracy, which\nwas ruined the second that more than\none American got involved in it. Then\nthere\u2019s free speech, a great theory made\nredundant when Americans figured\nout a way of mass-producing it. And\nfinally there was computer-generated\nimagery, unceremoniously desecrated\nthe second Walt Disney noticed it was\nmaking money.\nI will generally watch anything as\nlong as it\u2019s being projected onto a large\nenough screen, and so things like the\npolitical alignment of George Clooney\nor the breast alignment of Maggie Q\naren\u2019t really of massive importance to\nme in whether I enjoy a film or not. But\nas someone who almost broke down in\ntears at the sight of the latest series of\nSpooks, I am rather sensitive to good\nthings becoming awful.\nToy Story was, and still is, a fantastic film. I do not mean this simply in\na landmark-in-the-industry sense, but\nalso in the way it wrote to every level\nof the audience. The new age of CGI\nwasn\u2019t necessarily a facet of that and\nit didn\u2019t make the writers any better,\nbut Pixar\u2019s team ethic as a whole was\nsomething precious. It was something\nbeautiful.\nBeowulf \u2605\u2605\u2605\u272b\u272b\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nWriters: Neil Gaiman,\nRoger Avary\nCast: Ray Winstone,\nAnthony Hopkins,\nAngelina Jolie\nWright Penn that steals your attention\nin every scene she\u2019s in. I refrain from\nsaying steals the scene, because it is her\ncomputerised face that seems least to\nresemble anything human (which she\nis meant to be) rather than any extraordinary talent that does it. And in case\nyou\u2019re not sure what she really looks\nlike, you can rest assured knowing she\ndoes not look quite so airbrushed and\nfacially stretched in reality.\nAs a poem, this is a tale of men where\nwomen get about two pages of attention and that\u2019s including Grendel\u2019s\nmother (Angelina). The film makes\nthe women\u2019s roles pivotal which is the\nmeans by which Beowulf himself gets\nhis most severe character assassina-tion. Zemeckis seems to be implying\nthat after over a millennium of surviving as one of the most studied heroes in\nEnglish literature, women\u2019s liberation\ngets you. As far as its artistic merits go,\nthis won\u2019t go down in the same league\nas its source material. But it knows so,\nand at least the CGI is honest about\nwhat it is.

The\nseats keep filling up as a stream of\nyoung professionals and their erudite\nolder kin flow quietly up the aisles and\ninto the seats. There are a lot of Burmese too \u2013 unexpectedly, many are\nfrom the younger generation. During\nthese uncertain times, the Diaspora\ncongregates in quiet, intimate spaces,\nfar away from the intently listening\nears of the junta and their informers.\nBut this is not Rangoon. Old habits die\nhard, as they say.\nWhen the lights go down, the sound\nof crickets emanates from the tinny\nspeakers and the lone figure of the\nlady steps to the fore before a modest\nbackground depicting the interior of a\nprison cell \u2013 presumably the notorious\npenitentiary in Insein, on the outskirts\nof Rangoon. The lady is, of course, Daw\nAung San Suu Kyi \u2013 Nobel Peace Laureate and daughter of Burma\u2019s revolutionary Bogyoke Aung San, hailed as a\nfemale equivalent of Nelson Mandela\nby some, and universally revered by all\nin her impoverished nation.\nUnless you have been living in a cave\nfor the past few months, you will have\nseen the so-called \u201cSaffron Revolution\u201d\nsplashed across the mainstream media\nin reference to the fuel-price hikes and\nthe ensuing chaos that ensued when\nthe people, led by their charismatic\nBuddhist monk leaders, protested\npeacefully for their rights. Shots were\nfired as the military junta rolled out its\nweapons in another clampdown echoing the relentless massacre of 1988.\nDuring the space of the 20th century,\nBurma went from being the region\u2019s\nbreadbasket to its basket case, chafing under the British and thrown into\na bizarre timewarp under the current\nmilitary regime. Burma has one of the\nhighest literacy rates in the region, and\nis blessed with bountiful natural re-sources, but the regime\u2019s mismanagement of its economy, infrastructure\nand natural resources have left it languishing so far in terms of development\nthat only Ethiopia is on a par with it in\nits semi-unique title of LLDC (least\neconomically developed country).\nHardship upon hardship piled upon\nthe Burmese and corruption infiltrated\nevery aspect of everyday life, from its\nbloated generals to schoolchildren.\nThen came the 8th of August 1988,\nand nothing was quite the same after\nthat. The only glimmer of hope was\nSuu Kyi, the daughter of Aung San, the\nman who had liberated the country\nfrom British rule earlier in the century\n(he was swiftly assassinated along with\nhis cabinet and replaced by a socialist\nregime). Entering politics for a democratic Burma, she founded the National League for Democracy (NLD)\nin 1988, winning a landslide election in\n1990. The regime was quick to annul\nthe result and continue her house ar-rest. Since 1989, she has spent over 10\nyears under house arrest. Her Rangoon\nhouse is overgrown and fenced off and\npassers-by have almost no chance of\nseeing the interior of the house, let\nalone the lady herself.\nAll of this is chronicled in The Lady\nof Burma, tracing Suu Kyi\u2019s memories from childhood and the scattered\nmemories of her parents, her rose-tinted recollections of Oxford at St\nHugh\u2019s and her coincidental return to\nRangoon in 1988 to attend to her dying mother and the accounts of the\nviolence that ensued. Almost sooth-ing, catatonic but always with supreme\ncontrol, actress Liana Gould mimics\nthe lady perfectly, from her gentle, intent stare down to her clipped accent.\nSuu Kyi\u2019s personal memories are the\nmore interesting \u2013 the world knows so\nlittle other than the public figure and\nsymbol of hope and quiet determination she has come to represent \u2013 and\nserve as respite from the production\u2019s\nharrowing, jarring reimaginations\nof violent standoffs, intense political\nstruggle and the almost regular reports\nof close ones being killed or placed\nin forced labour camps. Between her\npersonal identity and her political one,\nthere is little to separate them, and the\nconnection is reinforced and reempha-sised throughout.\nAt an hour and fifteen minutes, it\nis relatively brief but with Gould the\nsole cast member, it manages to pack\na lot in. She runs the gamut of emo-tions, highlighting the impressive direction and writing, and inhabits the\nbodies and minds of a whole host of\ncharacters. Her impersonation of normal Burmese is hilariously convincing.\nSomehow she makes us believe, and\nholds our attention through the entire\nhour, never waning or losing our inter-est. Her tender impersonations of a\nmother absent from the adolescence\nand eventual adulthood of her sons\nresonate with an earthy pathos, and so\ntoo does her heartbreaking decision to\nstay with her country when her husband is diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in Britain.\nThe Lady of Burma is said to have\nThe protesting was well-covered at the time by the media, but the struggle in Burma extends far beyond this year\u2019s more public events\nmade numerous Burmese audience\nmembers shed tears, and as a tribute to\nBurma\u2019s isolated leader and the dead,\nincarcerated, beaten and raped, it is a\nfitting one to an extent. However, its\nmain purpose is, of course, education.\nSo few truly appreciate the scale of the\ninternal strife of smaller nations such\nas Burma and others, and productions\nsuch as this produced at decisive moments can increase our level of understanding and awareness. Written\nbefore the events of this year \u2013 which\nare understandably not incorporated\n\u2013 The Lady of Burma also serves as a\nsource of income for Suu Kyi\u2019s charity of choice, Prospect Burma, offering scholarships to Burmese students\nin Thailand and India.

    "content": "31\nFriday 23 November 2007 felix\nnarrowing gulley until it became too\ntechnical for walking poles.\nFriday 6 July\nWe had an early start to attempt a very\nattractive line up the slabs to the east-northeast of Laguna Blanca. Markus\nand I climbed this and it turned out\nto be a four pitch climb with beautiful crack sections. However, several pieces of in-situ gear were found\nwhich suggests this was not a first as-cent. It would be possible to continue\nthis climb to the summit of a choice\nof pinnacles. We decided not to climb\nfurther as the point reached after four\npitches was the logical end to the aesthetic line, and based on the amount\nof in-situ gear found up to that point\nit would not be a first ascent. In the\nevening some small clouds began to\nappear, up to this point the weather\nhad been totally cloudless, and warm\nenough to climb in a base layer during\nthe day. The difference between sun\nand shade temperatures was remarka-ble, entering the shade felt like walking\ninto the frozen foods department of a\nsupermarket.\nSaturday 7 July\nRest day. There was significant snowfall through the night and most of the\nhigher ground was covered in snow.\nSunday 8 July\nClimbing was not possible due to the\nsnow. Bernard and I explored the valley to the north by walking to the Col\nthat leads to what we called \u2018Torrini\u2019.\nIt looked stunning but already had\nmany established routes on it. Ben and\nHal explored \u2018the big wall\u2019 area to the\nnorth-northwest of base camp. The\nbig wall was one of the most inspiring\npieces of rock we found out there. It\nwas 400-500m of vertical (sometimes\noverhanging) rock. We decided we had\nto attempt it.\nMonday 9 July\nMore snow, hail and wind throughout\nthe day. We realised that some kind of\nrodent was nibbling on our cereals and\nchocolate so we ended up hanging all\nour food from bushes and boulders.\nTuesday 10 July\nThe weather improved and the sun\ncame out occasionally in-between the\nclouds. Hal, Markus and I carried gear\nto the base of the big wall and returned to base camp.\nBernard and Ben\nclimbed a mixed\nroute (grade\nIII/4)\non\nthe slabs near the Col that lead to the\nnext valley to the north-west of base\ncamp.\nWednesday 11 July\nHal and I attempted and retreated three\nlines on the big wall, the wall turned out\nto be very loose and deceptively steep,\ndifficult and cold, with snow and ice\non many holds. All three lines looked\nfairly straightforward but as soon as\nwe stepped onto them we found the\nangles of the holds and formation of\nthe rock somehow forced us to lean\naway as though on a severe overhang.\nThe amount of loose rock was over-whelming; the majority of holds were\nloose enough to remove with a moderate pull. Rock that seemed solid at first\nwould then move readily when pulled\nfrom a slightly different direction. If\nthe rock had been solid the wall would\nhave been superb, steep climbing, with\nvery large holds and good gear. However, instead it was steep with very few\nsolid holds and the constant stress of\na potential fall onto bad protection.\nOccasionally we encountered a short\nsection of solid rock \u2013 these sections\nhad very good quality climbing. And\nthis was what encouraged us to con-tinue. We did not have any success on\nthe first day but found a promising line\nof weakness that we would pursue the\nnext day. We returned to base camp in\nthe evening. Ben and Bernard rested\nat base camp after completing a mixed\nroute the day before.\nThursday 12 July\nHal and I climbed 35m on the big wall,\nfollowing the line of weakness up a diagonal crack that we found on the previous day. The first pitch was climbed\nin mountain boots as there was a significant amount of snow and ice. We\nset up an anchor after 25m, equalising\n5 pieces of gear. The next pitch was cut\nshort when we encountered an overhanging section that was startlingly\nloose. We spent a little over 30\nminutes clearing loose rock\nfrom a small platform\nto enable a solid sling belay below this sec-tion. We had to stop clearing loose rock\neventually when we realised that we\nwere gradually destroying the platform\nthat we were sitting on \u2013 the rock did\nnot seem to get any more solid regard-lessofhowdeepwedug.Westudiedthe\noptions and decided to try and traverse\nrightwards then move up on a leftward\nleaning line of weakness. However\nthis would have to wait until the following day. We abseiled down and left\nthe ropes to ascend the next day and\nthen bivouacked next to the lake near\nthe base of the wall. Markus, Ben and\nBernard traversed the big ridge, starting south-west of base camp.\nFriday 13 July\nIt took an entire day for Hal and I to\ntraverse 8m in an attempt to find a\nline of weakness on the overhanging\nsection on the big wall. At every stage\nwe would reassess the possibilities in\nterms of finding the best line of weakness with the least loose rock, traversing slightly, then attempting to climb\ndiagonally up and left, then up and\nright, then straight up, failing that we\nwould traverse further rightwards and\nrepeat the process. We climbed the\ntraverse in mountain boots to avoid\ncold toes. Eventually we could not go\nany further when we could not find\ngear placements, so we placed a bolt\nby hand, whilst hanging from two marginal BD micro nuts, in order to retreat\nfrom the position and to leave a solid\nanchor to ascend to the next day. Bernard, Ben and Markus climbed a short\nicefall to the east of base camp.\nSaturday 14 July\nMarkus, Ben and Bernard climbed\nan existing bolted route on Torrini.\nHal and I ascended to the bolt and attempted to make some progress from\nthere. There appeared to be several op-tions, either traverse right and follow a\nflake system leftwards or trend slightly\nleftwards and up to a small ledge or\nhead diagonally leftwards to a section\nof less steep rock. By the end of the day\nwe had tried all of the options, each\none taking an extraordinary amount of\ntime. Due to the loose rock each move\nrequired excavation, cleaning and the\ntesting of many holds. Placing gear was\neven more time consuming, most usable holds would take a moderate pull\n\u2013 but not the pull of a fall, so finding\na good placement required more time.\nWe resorted to a \u2018safety in numbers\u2019\nidea placing gear at almost every op-portunity. In spite of this we were not\nreally willing to push ourselves as we\ndidn\u2019t trust the gear; getting passed\nthat crux section (the terrain appeared\nto ease off around 15m higher) would\nrequire bold climbing on loose rock\nwith the possibility of gear ripping. We\ndiscussed alternative tactics and decided that we could no longer pursue\nthe objective in the same manner so we\nabseiled from the anchor (consisting\nof 7 equalised parts, including a\nbolt). We considered looking for\nan easy way to the summit then\nabseiling down from the top,\ncleaning each pitch and\nslinging (or bolting)\nanchors. In the\nevening, we\nwalked up\nto the\nridge on the west to see if we could find\na way up, but there was no straightforward way.\nSunday 15 July\nHal walked up the gulley to the east of\nthe big wall to see if there was a way\nto the summit from there whilst I retrieved the gear from the big wall (leav-ing one bolt and one piece of abseil\ncord). There was no simple way to the\ntop so we returned to base camp.\nMonday 16 July\nWe all carried bivi gear to make a camp\nin the next valley. Once we had set up\nthe bivi spot we checked out the surrounding rock. There was a lot of it, and\nall of it was north-facing so it received\nsunlight for most of the day, which was\na nice change. Unfortunately there was\nno running water nearby so we had to\nmelt snow for water, but it was full of\ngrit and so had an interesting texture.\nTuesday 17 July\nBernard and I climbed a route which\nwe named \u2018La Cueva C\u00f3moda\u2019 on the\nwall we came to know as \u2018lower Torrini\u2019. Markus and Ben climbed two\nroutes, one called \u2018Motivationsriss\u2019 on\nthe lower Torrini and one that Markus\nnamed \u2018LaLiLu\u2019 in the \u2018mid Torrini\u2019\narea. Hal was bruised by loose rock so\ncould not climb.\nWednesday 18 July\nHal and I inspected, cleaned and practiced on top-rope the top pitch of a\npotential line in the mid Torrini area.\nAs we had entered the valley we had\nall noticed a particularly striking\npiece of rock, so we decided\nto try and find out if\nit would be\nclimb-able. It was clear that the hardest\npitch would be the top, which was\nfairly accessible from the other side\nof the valley. It was a 20m slab that\nappeared to have no natural protec-tion, but had a many small crystals\nprotruding from its surface. The\nclimbing was some of the highest\nquality we had ever experienced, im-maculate, solid granite, with a beautifully flowing sequence of moves. It\nwas the kind of climbing where you\nfeel \u2018in the zone\u2019 after the first move.\nThursday 19 July\nHal and I set off to climb the line we\nhad looked at the day before. Ben,\nBernard and Markus rested at advanced camp. The crux pitch went\nsmoothly, but the diagonally rising\ncrack-line traverse turned out to be\nharder than expected and was also\nfilled with dirt and moss. About half\nway across I had to stop and clean\nit out as it was getting hard to see\nbecause of all the moss falling into\nmy eyes. At one point I turned away\nform the wall to spit out some dirt,\nthis unfortunately landed on Hal.\nFriday 20 July\nReturned to base camp.\nSaturday 21 July\nBen, Hal and I collected the remainder of the gear from the advanced\ncamp in the next valley and returned\nto base camp. Markus and Bernard\nclimbed a three pitch VS 4c near\nCuernos Del Diablo and returned to\nbase camp in the evening.\nSunday 22 July\nWe rested at base camp, made preparations to leave, and packed gear and\nfood. Andean Summits\u2019 jeeps arrived\nin the evening to take us home.\nThe members of the Imperial\nCollege Quimsa Cruz 2007 expedition would like to thank the\nfollowing for their kind support:\nImperial College London, Sir\nRichard Sykes, Mount Everest\nFoundation, British Mountaineering Council, First Ascent,\nPHD Designs,\nRab, and Terra Nova.\n\u201cThe kind of\nclimbing where\nyou feel \u2018in the\nzone\u2019 after the\nfirst move\u201d\n\u201cThe difference\nbetween sun\nand shade\ntemperatures\nwas remarkable\u201d\n\u201cThe climbing\nwas some of the\nhighest quality\nwe had ever\nexperienced\u201d\nBeautiful Bolivia\n\n"

The thesaurus provided by the \u2018lovely\u2019\npeople at Microsoft can provide\nhours and hours of entertainment simply by its overuse. Try\nit some time. Below is a childish story\nI wrote followed by the same story put\nthrough the thesaurus, in some cases\nas many as five times.\nNow I warn you that it gets a little\nmessy, and the normal rules of grammar no longer apply, but, if you read it\nlike it makes sense then it very nearly\ndoes(/doesn\u2019t). Before I unleash Microsoft\u2019s gift to the world of comedy on\nyou however, allow me to share my own\ngame which you can play right here and\nright now. It\u2019s quite simple. Take a film\ntitle (without cheating and using the\ninternet), change one word for nudist\nand then begin to laugh heartily. Give\nit a shot. My Big Fat Nudist Wedding,\nDie Hard with a Nudist, An Inconvenient Nudist, The Nudist Samurai, the\nfun is never ending. Anyway, back to\nthe story:\nDespite a flourishing head of hair Mr.\nO\u2019Donnell had a constant fixation with\nstrawberry cheesecake. \u201cStrawberry\ncheesecake is the bestest thing in the\nwhole wide world\u201d, said Mr. O\u2019Donnell.\nAt work, Mr. Lardyright told him he\nhad to \u201cStop eating that darned dessert\u201d. So he hid under a bucket in the\nlady\u2019s toilet for three days. When Mr.\nLardyright found out about this it made\nhim mad. Now Mr. O\u2019Donnell had a\nbig problem because, without money\nfrom work he couldn\u2019t buy cheesecake.\nMr. O\u2019Donnell vowed to get his job\nback. He washed Mr. Lardyright\u2019s car\nto see if that would help, but it didn\u2019t.\nThen he played Mr. Lardyright a tune\non his recorder. But that didn\u2019t work\neither. Mr O\u2019Donnell didn\u2019t know what\nto do. Then one day, as he walked up to\nthe security gate with a large bowl of\nperch and a monkey wrench, he suddenly had a better idea. Mr O\u2019Donnell\nwent back to his car. It was a shiny\nred one. Mr O\u2019Donnell liked red. He\nput the perch in the pond and hid the\nwrench in his jacket pocket. Then he\ndrove to Morrisons and brought a\nsheet of card and some crayons. Eating the blue one made his tummy feel\nfunny. Mr O\u2019Donnell set about making\na card for Mr. Lardyright. It said, \u201cI am\nsorry\u201d on the front and there was a picture of a cat and a big red balloon. Mr.\nO\u2019Donnell was very pleased with him-self. Mr. Lardyright said \u201cMan! Do you\nhave the mind of a three year old?\u201d But\nMr. O\u2019Donnell was thirty-eight and\nthree quarters. So he had a paddy.\nIn malice of a blossoming cranium\nof tresses Mr. O\u2019Donnell included an\nunwavering passion fleeting throughout strawberry cheesecake. \u201cStrawberry cheesecake is the bestest yearning\nin the absolute inconsequential boulevard dust\u201d, pretended Mr. O\u2019Donnell.\nDeceitful on slog, Mr. Lardyright, (on-the-ball him) fitted en route for slam\ndownhill disbursement, thus, vis-\u00e0-vis,\nirksome syrupy.\nAs a conclusion he secluded inferior\nthan a treasure chest in the female\u2019s\nadhesive condition, expected for musical tones of unremitting continuation.\nWhat instant, Mr. Lardyright recognized non-manifestation unfolding\nto this it derelict him tactless. By the\nside of the handy, Mr. O\u2019Donnell blew\nhis own trumpet, (a mammoth quan-dary), prearranged that, in the middle\nof no equipped capital as of overhaul,\nhe couldn\u2019t crust absent prevalence designed for cheesecake. Mr. O\u2019Donnell\nassured to exhume squeeze of his\nbusiness cultivate. He unsoiled Mr.\nLardyright\u2019s wagon to scrutinize the\ncondition, so since to would give a\nhand, previous than it achieved not.\nCataloguing alongside, to silky the\nevolution of, he betrothed in respite in\nthe ballet company of Mr. Lardyright;\na hymn listed his traitor. But that accomplished not trade also.\nMr O\u2019Donnell carried out not be on\ntop of recognizable conditions with \u201cI\nbeg your pardon?\u201d towards execute.\nSubsequently single-handed fragment\nof sun-up hours, for the stimulus that\nhe hiked cognisant to the buttressing\nfront entrance, via entombment of a\ncosmic deliver drop of \u201cconfiscate it\nunproblematic\u201d involuntary and an\norangutan haul, he swiftly included a\nfiner manifestation. Mr O\u2019Donnell fervently inverted en route for his gig. It\nwas a beaming pink superstar.\nMr O\u2019Donnell was analogous to bur-gundy. He situated the recreational\narea physically on apex of delimited by\nthe lagoon and restricted the tweak in\nhis skin wrinkle. Next he congregated\nto Morrisons and acquired a segment\nof credential and a scope of buff dedication tackle. Utilization of the cobalt\nsingle refined his appetite logic comi-cal. Mr O\u2019Donnell situated, scheduled\nthe subject matter of dexterity, a merit\npredictable in aid of Mr. Lardyright. It\nassumed, \u201cI am penitent\u201d on the masquerade and wholeheartedly available\nwas a facsimile of a cat and a colossal\nburgundy sizzling atmosphere expand.\nMr. O\u2019Donnell was terrifically at alleviating in the itinerary of himself. Mr.\nLardyright believed \u201cFellow! Assassinate you include the mental power of\na three rendezvous seasoned?\u201d But Mr.\nO\u2019Donnell was thirty-eight and three\nbillet. In favour of that rationale he\nclinched a wheeze.\nLet\u2019s talk about God, Matty\nJellybean\nT\nwo weeks ago (#1,386,\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk about God,\nbaby\u201d) Matty Hoban introduced the new Atheist\nand Agnostic Society. On\nbehalf of the Christian Union I\u2019d like to\nsay welcome. I was surprised a month\nago to learn that Imperial didn\u2019t have\nan Atheist society and it\u2019s good to have\nyou around.\nI was encouraged by your call to be\npro-active against apathy and would\ncompletely stand by it. A couple of days\nago I came across a quote from Martin\nLuther King, \u201cA man who won\u2019t die for\nsomething is not fit to live.\u201d Surely bumbling through life with no direction or\nvision is just a waste of time.\nIt puzzles me, though, how you intend to stop apathy and promote atheism at the same time.\nPersonally, the notion that we are\nhere as a cosmic insignificance due to\n15 billion years of good luck to live our,\nsay, 24x365x80 hours and then return\nto non-existence and be forgotten in a\nhundred years (how many of your great\ngrandparents\u2019 names do you know,\nlet alone jobs, friends and favourite\ncolours?) doesn\u2019t thrill me. Rather it\nleaves me feeling pretty indifferent\nto the choices that I have open to me\n\u2013 what difference will it make, really,\nwhether I\u2019m a doctor or a plumber or\njust a grumpy old man?\nThe apostle Paul wrote: \u201cIf in this life\nonly we have hoped in Christ, we are of\nall people most to be pitied\u2026If the dead\nare not raised, \u2018Let us eat and drink,\nfor tomorrow we die\u2019 \u201d (1 Corinthians\n15:19,32 - The Bible). He argues that if\nthere\u2019s nothing more than we can see\naround us we might as well just have\nsome fun before we die.\nHowever, given Paul\u2019s confidence\nthat there is life beyond this painful one\nand that God is working through Paul\u2019s\nsufferings to bring about ultimate good\n(just read the rest of the chapter to see\nwhere the world is going) he doesn\u2019t\nwant to just eat and drink. He wants to\nbe pro-active in working for the God\nwho has saved him and who will welcome him into the next life as a son\nbecause of the death and resurrection\nof Jesus. It\u2019s only because of his hope\nin God and eternal life that Paul can\nconclude, \u201ctherefore, my beloved broth-ers, be steadfast, immovable, always\nabounding in the work of the Lord,\nknowing that in the Lord your labour\nis not in vain\u201d.\nIn the Lord \u2013 because of his love and\nhis final plan \u2013 our decisions and our\nwork have a point. Otherwise they\u2019re\njust vanity.\nThis is a longer conversation than\nwe can reasonably have in the opinions\npages of Felix which is why I\u2019d love to\ninvite everyone reading this along to\nImpact. This is an event the CU runs\nevery Tuesday at 12 in the UDH looking at objections to the Christian faith\n\u2013 from whether God exists (he does, by\nthe way) to whether allowing religious\ngroups to influence society really is\nwrong.\nFor example, this week we were\nthinking about the charge \u201cIts ethics are socially regressive!\u201d and next\nweek is \u201cI\u2019m happy without God, why\ndo I need him?\u201d. With a short talk explaining what the Bible says and a time\nfor questions or thrashing the issues\nthrough with the people around you\nit\u2019s a fun way to spend lunch. Plus (or it\nwouldn\u2019t be a CU event) there\u2019s food!\nSee you there.\n\u201c\nTake a film\ntitle, change\none word to\n\u2018nudist\u2019 and then\nbegin to laugh\nheartily\nRichard Criddle\nIC Christian Union\nPresident\nMatty Hoban\nAtheist and Agnostic\nSociety Chair\nAn unreasonably expected reply\nT\nhanks for the warm welcome Richard, and I am\nslowly getting round to\nkicking the society into\nfull swing. Please do email if you would like to join or get\ninvolved.\nI just want to address Richard Criddle\u2019s and anyone else\u2019s concerns. When\nI wrote my column a couple of weeks\nago (referenced above), it was not to\npersuade people to become atheists or\nagnostics but merely to inspire them to\nact on their beliefs and help represent\nthose with non-religious views who\nfeel like they need support. I find the\ncomments made by Richard a little bit\ninsulting to both the intelligence and\nbetter judgement of the non-religious\nand religious.\nFirstly, I do not propose to stop apathy (this sounds impossible) but merely show that it makes sense to be active\nabout your beliefs, whatever they are.\nHowever, of the things Richard has said\nthat I find most concerning is the implication that wishful thinking comes\nabove evidence and logical discourse.\nIt is ignorant to say that those who\nhave come to the decision in their life\nthat they do not believe in God through\nthinking about it should then write off\nthat decision because their lives will\nnot have a \u2018higher\u2019 purpose or meaning\n\u2013 even though their higher purpose is\nonly revealed through a contradictory,\nbigoted and ancient text.\nThe most worrying thing that has\nbeen said is that we are here due to\n\u2018good luck\u2019, and you are at a scientific\ninstitute? I suggest he actually reads\nOn Natural Selection and he will realise that the words, \u201c15 billion years of\ngood luck\u201d are a complete contradic-tion. Surely the fact it took 15 billion\nyears means nature progressed slowly\ngoing through many permutations and\nmutations until the right combination\nprovided success for life? By the same\nlogic, I can be seen as a lucky Blackjack\nplayer even if I lost every single hand.\nThe meaning in my life comes from\nrelationships with people and it is difficult to debate with the religious on\nthese matters since we do not share the\nsame axioms and logical structures.\nWhen I am around my friends and\nloved ones, I find an enormous wealth\nof happiness and in nature, I see something which has allowed me to appreciate this happiness. For me, God does\nnot need to be there and that is where\nwe differ. I would however love to argue about the necessity for secularism.\n\n"

It\ntook another goal from the Strollers to\nget veteran Mikey P into gear to start\nthe amazing comeback the team was\nabout to pull off. With a beauty from\nTimmay (aka sharky junior) and an unexpected tap into the back of the goal\nby novice Aaaaaadam Baldwin before\nhalf time, the underdogs were in high\nspirits despite the lung burn, stitch and\nother signs of poor fitness displayed\nby some of the members following the\nusual chaos of a Saturday night.\nStrollers came back strong as the\nRSM got carried away with the score\nline being in our favour so early on in\nCharlotte Atteck\nHockey\nRSM Mixed XI 5\nStrollers Mixed XI 4\nthe game (lets face it doesn\u2019t happen\ntoo often) and let a goal through despite the fine efforts of the defence who\nhad a smashing game. Fresher Dave\nsoon retaliated and earned a nomination for champagne moment with an\nabsolute beauty from the top of the D\nto put us back in the game. Slushy man\nSteve gave it all he had in an attempt\nto loose his scoring virginity but it just\nwasn\u2019t to be... No matter, it will happen\none day and it will be exquisite.\nIt was my privilege to round up the\nmatch with the worst, most flukiest\ngoal known to man giving the RSM\nmixed team their first win of the sea-son. Man of the match had to be given\nto Aaaaaadam Baldwin for his brave\nperformance in both defence and up\nfront, Gilly managed to secure champagne moment for her constant giggling and almost giving away a long\ncorner in the first play of the game\nand slushy Stevie got TFC for not being able to follow through and get the\nball in the goal although his efforts in\nthe pub after could not be faulted in\nthe least.\nAll in all a fantastic game, thanks to\nSusie for her continuing contribution\nand excellent skippering of the team\nand to everyone who showed up to\nplay it was a pleasure as always.\nThe IC 1st Netball team are on a\nroll this season having not lost a single game in both ULU and BUSA. The\n29/10/07 saw the ladies in blue facing\nKing\u2019s Medic\u2019s 3rds at home in Ethos.\nImperial dominated the whole first\nhalf, however with the score at half\ntime being 36 \u2013 6, King\u2019s Medicals decided not to continue the match due\nto \u2018dodgy\u2019 umpiring. Obviously losing\ngracefully is not a Medic trait.\nThe next BUSA game saw us all the\nway out at Teddington to play the\nUniversity of Hertfordshire 2nd team\nthanks to yet another cock up by Holland Park. (I\u2019d like to thank Luke Taylor\nfor driving us like a lunatic in a bright\nyellow minibus all the way there before\nlegging it over to Harlington for his\nmatch. We love you Luke!). With us\nlending the medics our second umpire\n(a thank-you would be nice btw) we\nhad Jess Marley\u2019s mum stand in, despite driving from Cardiff that morning to come and watch. The game was\nlike our previous BUSA encounters,\nIC dominating from the start. Despite\nthe other team being very worthy op-ponents, their shooting and passing\naccuracy let them down and IC had\nanother convincing win, 51-16, Man\nof the Match went to Sara Willis, IC\nplayer went to Rachel Dilley and Twat\nof the match went to Jess Marley for\nrunning round the Union like a muppit\ntrying to sort out courts and umpires,\nand for telling everyone not to say the\numpire was her mum but then shouting \u201cmum\u201d when pulled up in the middle of the match.\nNext we were off to beautiful Staines\non Monday the 5th of November to\nplay Royal Holloway 2nds. Being distracted by the beautiful fireworks and\nthe thought of fish and chips from the\nchippy on the way back to the station,\nthe IC girls managed a win, although\nless than convincing, 39-26. Man of\nthe match went to Jen Lang and Twat\nof the Match went to Kate Chapman\nfor just being as dizzy as a blonde in a\nbeauty shop.\nOn the train to Luton with a hungover team we were off to challenge\nthe University of Bedfordshire 1st.\nThe game was challenging and the IC\ngirls were a little worried after watching their professional warm-up, whist\nstanding on the sideline gossiping\nabout the night before. The IC girls\nhowever came through in the end\nshowing it\u2019s not all about wanting to\nwin; it\u2019s more about wanting to get to\nthe pub ASAP, with a 67-35 win. Well\nNetball\nImperial 1sts 36\nKing\u2019s Medicals 3rd 3\nNetball\nImperial 1sts 51\nHertfordshire 3rd 16\nNetball\nRoyal Holloway 2nd 26\nImperial 1sts 39\nNetball\nBedfordshire 1sts 35\nImperial 1sts 67\nNetball\nUCL 3rd 14\nImperial 1sts 52\nSara Willis done guys, knew we were all feeling\nrough! After the game we went to their\nsponsors pub and polished off 4 pitchers of Strongbow (in true IC netball\nstyle) and a burger and chips (nothing\nbetter to cure a hangover), before getting the train back more than a little\ntipsy. Man of the Match went to Rachel\nDilley, IC player went to Candy Fisher\nand Twat of the match went to Kate\nChapman for getting her ass out in the\npub to show all the Beds girls her huge\nbruise from playing rugby.\nIn the pouring rain, we were off to\nchallenge UCL 3rds on the 19/11/07.\nDespite being freezing on court and the\nUCL team playing more like in a rugby\ngame than a netball game the girls in\nblue had yet another credible win, 52-14. Let\u2019s keep up the good work guys!\nMan of the match went to Sara Willis,\nIC player went to Lauren AndersonDring and Twat of the match went to\nKate Chapman for running round her\ngoal third cause she was cold and looking like a complete \u201ctwat\u201d whilst doing\nso.\nI\u2019d also like to take this opportunity\nto let the readers know, if they haven\u2019t\nalready heard, that the Rugby boys\nhave challenged the IC 1st to a netball\nmatch in order to raise money for char-ity. Therefore I\u2019d like to invite everyone\nto come along to Ethos on the Sat 24th\nof Nov (tomorrow!) 4-6 p.m to watch\nthe Rugby boys, most likely in dresses,\nmake fools of themselves playing (and I\nuse the term \u201cplaying\u201d very lightly) net-ball. It will cost \u00a32 to come and watch\nand all the money is going to the West\nLondon Sports Trust.\nBRING IT ON LADS!!!!\nSports Editor:\nYou girls haven\u2019t got a chance!\nNetball 1sts mammoth report on unbeaten run\nAfter an hour playing the \u2018weight\ngame\u2019 at the airport, a short fifty\nminute Easyjet flight to Geneva and a\ntwo hour coach journey me, Andy Parsons and Mike Halls-Moore arrived\nat Chamonix-Mont-Blanc, the capital\nof world climbing. After meeting up\nwith Luke, who informed us that \u201cthe\nweather was stable and we needed to\ngo up into the mountains now!\u201d we settled in to our new campsite home.\nThe next day we took the truly amazing Aiguille Du Midi cable car, feeling\nhighly conspicuous in the crowds of\ntourists with our 100 litre duffle bags\nfull of six days food and climbing packs\nbristling with axes and crampons. On\narriving at the Midi station (3842m)\nwe wasted no time, and after hiding\nour bags in an ice cave, headed out to\nthe Mer De Glace Glacier, squinting in\nthe blinding sunlight of a perfect Alpine day. We dashed up the stunningly\nbeautiful Arete Du Cosmeque in three\nhours and arrived back at the station\nfeeling breathless and rather pleased\nwith ourselves.\nIn continually superb weather we\nmanaged most of the Rebuffat Route\n(TD rock climbing), some of the MidiPlan traverse and Mont Blanc Du Tacul\n(4248). However sleepless nights due\nto the altitude and concrete floor of the\nstation forced us down after four days.\nAfter a couple of happy days dosing\naround Chamonix eating ice-cream,\nthe possibly of a storm front hitting in\na matter of days persuaded us it was\ntime to go for the biggy, Mont Blanc\nitself.\nThe next day an early morning cable\ncar, then a train journey, deposited us\nin the fog at the start of the Gouter\nRoute. Four hours of slog brought us\nout of the fog and on to the glacier.\nWe now had to cross the most lethal\npart of the route, the 100m wide Grand\nCouloir. This 70o snow gully is noto-rious, due to the large quantity of TV\nsized rocks which continually whiz\ndown it, released by melting ice or a\ncareless climber above. We roped up\nand ran across (not easy in crampons!)\nafter waiting for a gap in the fuselage.\nA breathless four hour scramble up a\n60o ar\u00eate made of teetering car sized\nblocks brought us to the Aiguelle Du\nGouter. We camped on the snow ridge\nabove, where watching the mountains\nchange colour in the sunset couldn\u2019t\nquite compensate for the onion flavoured snow/pasta mush which passed\nfor tea.\nWe were awoken from blissful sleep\nat 2am by a multitude of alarms and\nafter a solid hour of general faff we\nwere ready to go. During the first two\nhours of the accent a combination of\npitch blackness, biting cold and steep\ncramponing at altitude made for not an\nentirely pleasant experience. However\nby 5am the arrival of the sun in the East\ngave an illusion of warmth and more\nimportantly a view of the fantastically\nsinuous and knife edge Bosses Ridge\nwhich leads to the summit. Two hours\nof careful footsteps and false summits\nlater we had arrived at the Roof of Europe. It was an amazing place, with\nwhite and orange mountains stretching\nin all directions, the clouds thousands\nof metres below us and the sky above\nlooking un-naturally black. However\nlack of feeling in fingers and toes encouraged us not to linger and ten minutes of frantic photo snapping latter we\nwhere on our way back.\nThe twelve hour descent was long\nand torturous and we finally arrived\nback to Chamonix in the dark. A crate\nof beer, 2 bottles of van rouge and a\nchilli later, we were all enjoying a well\nearned kip.\nMatthew Cooper\nA lovely trip to Mont Blanc\nAn RSM mixed hockey team The climbers at the summit\n\n"

I wonder if\nAnyone looked at me, forty years back,\nAnd thought, That\u2019ll be the life;\nNo God any more, or sweating in the dark\nAbout hell and that, or having to hide\nWhat you think of the priest. He\nAnd his lot will all go down the long slide\nLike free bloody birds. And immediately\nRather than words comes the thought of high windows:\nThe sun-comprehending glass,\nAnd beyond it, the deep blue air, that shows\nNothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.\nSad Steps\nGroping back to bed after a piss\nI part thick curtains, and am startled by\nThe rapid clouds, the moon\u2019s cleanliness.\nFour o\u2019clock: wedge-shadowed gardens lie\nUnder a cavernous, a wind-picked sky.\nThere\u2019s something laughable about this,\nThe way the moon dashes through clouds that blow\nLoosely as cannon-smoke to stand apart\n(Stone-coloured light sharpening the roofs below)\nHigh and preposterous and separate -Lozenge of love! Medallion of art!\nO wolves of memory! Immensements! No,\nOne shivers slightly, looking up there.\nThe hardness and the brightness and the plain\nFar-reaching singleness of that wide stare\nIs a reminder of the strength and pain\nOf being young; that it can\u2019t come again,\nBut is for others undiminished somewhere.\nW\nhilst not quite\nAlfie Tennyson\nwhen it comes to\nstyle, Philip Arthur\nLarkin is one of\nBritain\u2019s most famous contemporary\npoets. It\u2019s hard to like the man, by definition \u2013 to like Larkin and his poetry\nyou need to have a certain amount of\nmisanthropy and general hatred about\nyou. But you can at least look at the\nverses and smile, which is exactly what\nwe\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll do this week.\nWe\u2019ve chosen some pieces from\nHigh Windows, one of Larkin\u2019s more\nsocially-focused anthologies, but Larking also wrote more lyrical, less weary\npieces too. This is the man at his best,\nthough \u2013 bitter, sharp and a mite de-pressed. MySpace with a degree in\nEnglish Literature and a flatshare with\nStephen Fry.\nFirst, a little on the poem\u2019s we\u2019ve selected for you. High Windows is the title poem for the anthology, and reflects\non the younger generation that Larkin\nwatched grow up. It was the output of\nthe Sixties, the first group to benefit\nfrom the sexual revolution and in turn\ncreate a divide between young and old.\nLarkin\u2019s call of \u201cparadise\u201d is, of course,\nmore than a little sarcastic, but what\nkeeps him thinking the most is the perception of his generation from the one\nabove them.\nWhen he was the age of the \u201ckids\u201d,\npeople thought that his generation\nwould be the one to be liberated. Freedom of speech and expression would\nallow them to live \u201cthe life\u201d, no religion\nor manual labour, just the long slide\ndown.\nDown is symbolic here for Larkin,\nthough, as he wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of\nthe freedom the young enjoyed. It was\npartly down to jealousy, as he himself\nadmits in other poems, but here he\ntails off into more speculative thoughts\n\u2013 high, unreachable windows bursting\nout onto open sky and freedom. Yet\nthey remain too high, the deep blue\nair being something he can only watch\nfrom distance.\nOur second piece is \u201cSad Steps\u201d, a\nmore morose selection from the anthology that shows some more interesting bits of Larkin\u2019s style. Here we see\nLarkin getting up in the early morning\nand trying to see beauty in the scene in\nfront of him.\n\u201cGroping back to bed after a piss\u201d is\ncharacteristic of the coarseness he uses\nto play off against more poetic images\nsuch as \u201cthe moon\u2019s cleanliness\u201d. Here\nwe have a very normal situation that is\nsuddenly changed by the presence of a\nnatural beauty.\nBut, Larkin being Larkin, he finds it\nhard to see the magic. The fourth stanza (verse) is another piece of sarcasm,\nas he can only \u201cshiver\u201d when he looks at\nthe view, thinking of those who see the\nsame view, the same beauty, but win\nout over him because of the \u201cstrength\u201d\nthey possess in the youth they have not\nyet spent.\nThis is characteristic of Larkin\u2019s\nstruggle with age and with decay.\nWhilst he bemoans the young, he often\nmourns his lack of youth \u2013 not so much\nbecause he wasted his, but because it is\ngone and now unretrievable.\nLarkin himself was something of a\ntragic figure, described by close friends\nas having been middle-aged since his\nearly teens. He had a pathological fear\nof death, old age, commitment and\nmore, and though he had a strangely\nchildlike devotion to his mother \u2013\nwhose death affected him greatly \u2013 he\nwas conspicuously less childlike in\nother respects.\nObsessions with pornography, fascism and racism were hinted at in\nposthumous biographies and books of\nletters, and though many of Larkin\u2019s\nclose friends deny it, the view does fit\nin with much of his life and works.\nMuch of what we could have known\nabout him, however, has been lost. He\nasked Monica Jones, a lifelong companion of his, to destroy more than\nthirty volumes of diaries and letters\nupon his death.\nDespite that, much of his character\nhas filtered through into history. His\nletters to Kingsley Amis, a close friend,\nreveal a lot about him, as do records of\nhis relationships with women. Though\nhe never married, he had two long-term and simultaneous relationships\nwith Monica Jones and Maeve Brennan, two very opposed women whom\neventually learned of his duplicity in\nlove.\nFor a librarian who lived most of\nhis life in Hull \u2013 a place he hated, and\nthus loved for exactly that reason \u2013 he\nwasn\u2019t such a boring character. His poetry has great variety over the course of\nhis life, and remains well worth reading\nto the day.\nLarkin was offered the Poet Laureate\nposition in 1984, but turned it down\nover the thought of becoming so central in the media. His poetry often criticised those who studied him, and not\nin a flattering light. Just one year after\nturning down the position, he died of\ncancer. He was sixty-three years old.\nStill genuinely readable to the day,\nLarkin\u2019s work is still thought of as\n\u201cpeople\u2019s poetry\u201d, and rightly so.\nHigh Windows can be bought\nonline for the princely sum of\n\u00a35.49, probably from amazon.\nco.uk or another equally giant\ninternet retailer. Go get it, and\ndon\u2019t look back. You\u2019ll be a better\nperson for it\n\u201cLarkin was\ndescribed as\nbeing middle-aged since his\nteens\u201d\n\u201cWhilst he\nbemoans the\nyoung, he often\nmourns his own\nold age\u201d\n\n"

I\u2019ll give you some real fucking culture, get your arse over here\nT\nhis week in SAIF we are\nback in tow with a truly\nenlightening piece of photography from the same\nartist as the breakthrough\n\u2018Rhapsody in Bogroll\u2019.\nWhen prompted for his view on\nthe piece, a 2nd year Physicist asked,\n\u201cWhat kind of tea leaves are they?\u201d This\nprovoked a certain train of thought in\nmy critical brain\u2026 What is the steam\nrepresenting? Is it the spirit of the Assam tea leaves, or the ghost of the tea\npicker? This has serious implications\nconcerning the third world tea growing\u2026 And breakfast.\nIf the tea is breakfast tea, we start to\nwonder what thoughts go through the\nartist\u2019s head at this time in the morn-ing. Cereal or toast? Thus we turn to\nthe question of the teacup. Why is it illuminated so? Immediately, our minds\nturn to the messianic symbolism surrounding the piece. With a shift back\nto the old tradition of looking to the\nfuture using tealeaves, the artist goes\none step further and tries to say that\nthis humble piece of crockery could,\nin fact, tell us when the Messiah will\nreturn. However, depending on your\nreligious leanings, it could just be that\nthe artist used too much flash.\nOn my brief interview with the artist before she rushed off to her next\ncaffeine fix, she mentioned the title of\nthe piece and its meaning: \u201cI called it\nDescartes\u2019 Teacup because of the question as to it\u2019s existence in the photo. It\nseems to have been erased from the\nframe completely. Is this one\u2019s bleary\neyed view of the teacup in the mornings when one has been rudely awaken\nfor her 9am lecture? Perhaps. But we\nwant it to exist so how can it have been\nerased. I\u2019m confusing myself now quite\nfrankly. You think up some bollocks for\nTHAT piece of shit.\u201d\nThis week\u2019s analysis was\nprovided courtesy of Cardinal\nWolsey. Originally a chief adviser\nto Henry VIII until his downfall\nand eventual death in 1530. He\nnow researches for the BBC2 quiz\nshow QI as well as occasionally\nfilling in for Jeremy Paxman on\nNewsnight.\nAs Christmas draws near, what\ncould be a better gift for a loved\none than The Best Of Student\nArt In Focus? Class A drugs and\nfisting? Probably. But you can\u2019t\nget that in Waterstones, because\nI checked No-one fucking reads these anyway. Do you?

    "content": "Last week saw the first Union Trading\nForum take place in the Union Bar and\nwas organised it to gather the views and\nopinions of our members who use our\nservices. Over thirty students turned up\nto give their opinions and views of the\nUnions\u2019 services (or maybe just to eat\nfree sandwiches) and I\u2019ve summarised\nsome of the points that were raised.\nA large number of our members\ncommented on the lack of glasses\nand the use of non-rigid plastic\nskiffs. The non-rigid plastic skiffs,\nwhich are disposable, contravene our\nenvironmental policy, and were reintroduced as a consequence of a supply\nissue with the rigid skiffs this summer.\nOnce the supply issues were resolved,\na stock of rigid skiffs were ordered\nimmediately, as such we had a large\namount of disposable skiffs left over\nwhich are used infrequently.\nOther concerns regarding the\nenvironmental policy included a lack\nof non-disposable cutlery, which\ndisappered from service earlier in the\nterm; a result of the large amount of\ncutlery being stolen. Fortunately we have\njust received a new stock of cutlery and\nplates, which, if you have eaten in da\nVinci\u2019s recently, you may have noticed.\nThere were a number of negative\ncomments on the speed of service, both\nwithin our catering outlets and in the\nbars. This is a recurring issue that we are\nwell aware of and is likely to be the result\nof training. Due to the large number of\npart-time student staff we employ; it\ncan be difficult to ensure a consistently\nhigh level of service. This year we have\nincreased the level of training our part-time bar staff receive and feel this has\nbeen reflected by the quality of service in\nour bars. We have attempted to reduce\nthe lunchtime queues in da Vinci\u2019s by\nmoving some of the speedier foods into\ndBs, where you can get hot soup, paninis\nand sandwiches throughout the day.\nAnother idea raised regarding the bars\nwas to the introduction of more drink\npromotions. This is something which\nI am keen to introduce, so I will be\nworking with Trading to deliver more\npromotions in the near future.\nAdditionally,\nsome members\ncommented on our\nentertainments\nprogram, with\nsome positive\ncomments\nregarding\nFreshers\u2019 Week\nand our newly\nintroduced Bar\nFTSE.

    "content": "18 felix Friday 23 November 2007\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\nPhilistine\u2019s guide to Playwrights\nArts Felix is on a mission to educate. This week Caz Knight remembers some of the world\u2019s best writers\nU\nnless you are an English\nliterature or drama student (does not apply at\nImperial) or take an interest in those subjects\nthen it is not surprising that you may\nnot known much, if anything at all,\nabout some of the most prominent and\ntalents playwrights that have existed\nand bequeathed upon us magnificent\nworks of art. Trying to choose a few\nto write about here was a hard task\nespecially when there are so many and\nbecause there can not be a definitive\n\u201cbest playwright\u201d as this is a very personal opinion. However, we can rank\nplaywrights (and indeed any other type\nof artist) in terms of their influence,\nnotoriety and how their works have\nbeen received. The playwrights below\ndo not convey directly my personal\nfavourites, as I keep remembering\nones I have forgotten. Instead I have\ntried to select a few \u201cimportant\u201d ones.\nOf course, the likes of Bertolt Brecht\n(Marxist German playwright and theatrical pioneer), Anton Chekov and\nHenrik Ibsen, although not included\nhere, have influenced the likes of Coward, Bernard Shaw and many others.\nI have also mentioned nothing of the\nancient Greek playwrights who have\ngiven us classics such as Oedipus Rex\n(Sophocles), The Bacchae and Medea\n(Euripides). Incidentally, Women of\nTroy, also by Euripides, is starting its\nseason at the National Theatre at the\nend of this month. For now let us go\nto the medley I have chosen for this\nfeature.\nWILLIAM SHAKESPEARE\n25 April 1564 \u2013 23 April 1616\nI don\u2019t think I could have got away\nwithout including what some call the\nMessiah of English Literature. Everyone educated at secondary school level\nin this country will have studied him\nat GCSE at least. It is a shame that the\nrequirement to study him will often\ndetract from the pleasure of reading\nhis work.\nNot only a playwright but a poet,\nShakespeare created 38 plays, 154\nsonnets, 2 long narrative poems and\nmuch else. His works have been performed more than any other the world\nover and one can guarantee that at any\ngiven time there will be a Shakespeare\nproduction going on the West End. I\nthink any philistine could name one of\nhis plays which include Othello, As You\nAudrey Hepburn appears alongside Rex Harrison in the 1964 adaptation of \u2018Pygmalion\u2019 \u2013 \u2018My Fair Lady\u2019\nLike It, Taming of the Shrew, The Tempest and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\nGeorge Bernard Shaw even coined the\nterm \u2018Bardolatry\u201d which means excessive adulation of Shakespeare!\nOSCAR WILDE\n16 October 1854 \u2013 30 November\n1900\nWinona Rider as Abigail and Daniel Day Lewis as John in the 1996 film\nversion of Miller\u2019s \u2018The Crucible\u2019\nWithout a question the wittiest man\never to have lived (in my humble opin-ion), Wilde was Irish and went to Oxford. Despite being married with chil-dren, he was arrested for sodomy; a\ncinematisation of his life was made in\n1995 starring another great British wit\n(Stephen Fry) as Wilde and Jude Law,\ntoken eye candy, but brilliant none the\nless as Wilde\u2019s lover, Bosie. His works\ninclude his only novel, A Picture of Dorian Grey and plays An Ideal Husband,\nA Good Woman and The Importance\nof Being Earnest all of which have been\nmade into delightful films. My favourite way to enjoy Oscar Wilde is simply\nby reading a few of his many, many\nquotations: I will leave you with a few\nnow.\n\u201cA man can be happy with any woman as long as he does not love her.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone who lives within their means\nsuffers from lack of imagination.\u201d\n\u201cFashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every\nsix months.\u201d\nGEORGE BERNARD SHAW\n26 July 1856 \u2013 2 November 1950\nAnother Irish playwright who was also\na keen political activist, his 60 plays\nare predominantly comical but with\nearnest underlying messages. Among\nhis political plights were the equal\nrights for men and women, alleviating the abuse on the working classes\nand Fabianism. He started the Fabian\nsociety (a British intellectual socialist\nsociety), which endeavoured to further\nsuch causes and also founded LSE with\nmoney left from the society. In terms of\nhis plays, much inspiration was drawn\nfrom Norwegian playwright, Henrik\nIbsen who pioneered modern realistic\ndrama. This was a sharp contrast to the\nfrothy, sentimental drama which the\nLondon stage had seen in preceding\nyears. Probably one of his more famous\nworks is Pygmalion which was made\ninto a musical (My Fair Lady) starring\nRex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn.\nROBERT CEDRIC SHERRIFF 6\nJune 1896 \u2013 13 November 1975\nI chose R.C. Sherriff for the sole reason\nthat he wrote my favourite play of all\ntime: Journey\u2019s End. I know it inside\nout having studied it at GCSE, but that\ndid not perturb my enthusiasm! The\nplay ran recently in the West End for\nsome time and received huge praise.\nSherriff was educated at New College, Oxford and served in WW1 and\nwas wounded at Passchendaele, near\nYpres. It was on his experiences in the\nwar which formed the basis for Journey\u2019s End. The play is highly emotive\nand encompasses both the horrific,\nbrutal reality of war as well as exploring the friendships which form during\nthe ordeal. Laurence Olivier appeared\nin the first production of the play in\n1928, taking on the lead role of Stanhope, the borderline alcoholic officer\nwho is made uneasy upon the arrival\nof a younger boy from his old school.\nSherriff wrote the screenplay for movie\nGoodbye Mr. Chips, adapted from the\nnovel by James Hilton.\nSIR NOEL COWARD\n16 December 1899 \u2013 26 March\n1973\nNoel Coward seems to be a jack-of-all-trades.

The theatre\u2019s\nname was changed from The Albery\nto The Noel Coward Theatre for the\npremiere of Broadway hit, Avenue\nQ. In Coward\u2019s day the theatre would\nhave been called The New Theatre\nand it was there that he made his acting debut in 1920. It was not until 1924\nthat he was propelled to stardom for\nhis role in the play Vortex, which contained many sexual and drug related\nissues. During the war Coward sang to\nthe troops to boost moral.

    "content": "37\nfelix\nFriday 23 November 2007\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk Sport\nThe importance of carbohydrates in exercise\nand sports performance\nAndy Mitchell\nWhen most people think about nutrition for sports performance or general exercising they will almost always\nthink about their protein intake and\nwhether they are getting enough to\nbuild bigger, stronger muscles. Few\never worry about their carbohydrate\nintake, except for some of you endurance athletes out there. Most athletes\nand gym users seem to forget the importance carbohydrates have to play in\nperforming good quality workouts or\nplaying well in sports competitions.\nCarbohydrates can be split into two\nmain categories, simple and complex.\nSimple carbohydrates are broken down\neasily by the body to provide energy\nquickly and come in the form of sug-ars. Too many of these in the diet and\nthey cause a sudden increase in blood\nsugar levels, which although will give\nyou a big energy high at first, result in\nan energy crash causing you to feel fatigued and lifeless. Complex carbohydrates however are broken down slower by the body and provide a steadier\nstream of energy into the body keeping\nblood sugar levels balanced and making you feel energetic throughout the\nday. These complex carbohydrates\ncan be divided further into two more\ncategories- digestible and indigestible.\nDigestible carbohydrates such as pasta,\npotatoes, bread etc are broken down\nfor energy, while the indigestible ones\n(commonly know as fibre and found\nmainly in fruit and vegetables) are used\nin keeping the intestines healthy and\nyour trips to the toilet regular!\nCarbohydrates, along with fats, are\nthe body\u2019s main sources of fuel for all\nof its biological functions and daily\nactivities. The percentage of carbohydrates or fat used to fuel these functions or activities varies dependent on\nthe level of intensity. Low to moderate intensity activities (such as sitting,\nwalking or easy jogging) are primarily\nfuelled by fat and as activities become\nhigher in intensity (weight training,\nrunning or any sports activity) carbohydrates take over. Certain functions\nof the body such as the working of the\nbrain rely solely on energy from carbohydrates (glucose) and cannot be\nfuelled by fats.\nTo perform high intensity exercise or\nsport the body needs plenty of carbohydrates to provide it with energy. The\ncarbohydrates to do this are stored\nin the muscle cells or liver as glycogen and in the blood as glucose. The\nmuscle holds the largest amount of\nenergy (over four times as much as the\nliver and over 17 times as much as the\nblood) and if these muscle stores are\nlow then you will struggle to perform\nat your best. The less energy you have\nin your muscles the less force you can\ncreate to lift weights, run faster, jump\nhigher etc. As I mentioned the brain\nrequires glucose to function and if liver\nglycogen and blood glucose levels are\nlow this can result in loss of function of\nthe brain limiting neuromuscular coordination resulting in poor perform-ance. Therefore this drop in exercise or\nperformance will mean that the body\nfails to receive an overload stimulus\nand thus will not adapt and improve.\nSo how much carbohydrate should\nyou be having in your diet to maintain\nadequate muscle glycogen stores and\nhigh levels of performance? Studies\nsuggest that active sports people and\ngym users should have a diet consisting of 60-70% carbohydrates. To calculate the amount of carbohydrates in\ngrams per day you first need to know\nhow many calories you need to consume a day for your daily activities.\nThe average active male will require\naround 2500-3000 calories a day. Carbohydrates provide four calories per\ngram. So if we assume you need 3000\ncalories per day and 65% of these come\nfrom carbohydrates then you need\n1950 calories worth of carbs per day or\n487.5 grams.\nIf you would like to find out how\nmany calories you need to consume a\nday then book in for a body stat test at\nthe gym where you will be able to get\nan estimated value (oh the shameless\nadvertising!).\nThe new intake of Imperial College\nrowers had their first taste of victory\non Saturday, as the Women\u2019s Novice\neight took victory in Cambridge. The\nboatclub novices, most of whom only\nstarted rowing in October, had been\ntraining hard for the \u2018Cambridge Winter Head\u2019 and obtained an impressive\nset of results.\nFor those who know little about\nrowing (i.e. most people!), the season\nof \u2018Head\u2019 races runs roughly from October until March. A Head race is essentially a time trail, usually over a\ndistance of 3-6 kilometres, with boats\nin the same category starting one after\nanother. The winner is then the crew\nthat has completed the course in the\nfastest time.\nFor Saturday\u2019s race, four eights (each\nwith eight rowers and a cox) travelled\nto Cambridge, leaving at 7 in the morn-ing. Each crew raced twice during the\nday, with men\u2019s results including 5th\nICURFC 3rd XV match medic demolition report\nSince the previous Wednesday\u2019s mo-rale-crushing defeat at home to Kings\nMedicals, IC\u2019s 3rd XV had all eyes on\nredeeming themselves at Teddington\nin their first face-off with the Scum for\nthis season. Travelling by public transport to an away match always causes\ndifficulties in preparing mentally for\nthe match ahead. So when IC arrived\nvia the wonders of National Rail with\nless than half an hour before curtain\nup, they were relieved to have kick off\npushed back 10 minutes. With motivational speeches from Captain Ollie\n\u201cSouthern Fairy\u201d Bevis and veteran\nmedic crusher Alex \u201cPain-Train\u201d Fergusson over, IC were ready to take the\ngame to the Scum on their own soil.\nWith barely 5 minutes gone, IC\nseemed decidedly to have the upper\nhand. After relentless pressure from\nthe IC pack, an ever-so-sexy interception deep inside the medic\u2019s half from\nBorja \u201cI\u2018m a back, honestly\u201d Sordo set\nup a ruck, from which the unrelenting\nforwards were only too happy to provide secure ball for scrum-half Penfold\nto offload on the blind side to Adam\nBaldwin. After making several yards,\nRugby\nImperial Medicals 3rd XV 24\nImperial Men\u2019s 3rd XV 31\nPenfold\nand being tackled just short of the line,\nBaldwin returned the ball with a beautiful pop off the floor to Penfold, who\nopened the scoring with a try in the\ncorner. After this, the medic vermin\ncame back and scored a soft uncon-verted try, leaving the score at 5-5.\nThis level-pegging did not, howev-er, hold for long. Filled with renewed\ndetermination, IC took it back to the\nmedics and camped themselves in\ntheir half, with the pack supplying\nimmaculate ball from their immense\nscrummaging for the backs to work\ntheir magic via 3rd team debutant fly-half, Jack \u2018I can\u2019t remember his surname\u2019 It was one of these displays of\ncolossal scrummaging that set up IC\u2019s\nsecond try. With the back line playing\nthe ball straight through hands, and\nmaking yards themselves, Man of the\nMatch, full back George Watkins, cut\na beautiful line through the medic de-fence, scoring IC\u2019s second try, with it\nbeing converted by Sordo de la Pena.\nOnce again, the medics came back to\nbring the scores even at 12-12.\nWith lots of encouraging talk from\nboth captain and vice captain at half\ntime, IC took the ball from the restart,\nknowing that this game was theirs for\nthe taking. Once again, it was flanker\nBaldwin who made the break, catching\nthe ball inside his own half, selling the\nScum a dummy and sprinting through\nthe now gaping hole in the medic \u201cdefence\u201d before side-stepping their \u201cfullback\u201d and placing it underneath the\nposts with the greatest of ease. Once\nagain, this try was swiftly converted by\nBorja, making the score 19-12. After a\nperiod of light pressure by the medics,\nan unfortunate mis-kick allowed the\nmedics to come back with the softest\nof soft tries. Their conversion managed to bring the medics back into the\ngame at 19-19.\nIC were not going to give up lightly,\nhowever. After applying yet more pressure following the restart, the medics\ncleared their lines with a kick into the\nIC half. This was caught by Charles\n\u201cNot-So-Token-Frenchy\u201d who started\na rampage of sublime interplay with\nWatkins, with the latter teasing the\n\u201cfailed engineers\u201d behind their own try\nline before slamming it down a short\ndistance from the posts. 24-19. Scum\nscored. 24-24.\nAfter another irresistible example of\nthe mean scrummaging machine that\nthe IC pack was, the front 8 were then\ntreated to a awe-inspiring display of\ndefence-penetrating running, ending\nwith Max \u201cNo-Nickname-Required\u201d\nSteele with only two human-butchers\nto beat. In what can only be described\nas a demonstration of absolute sports-manship, Twat of the Match Steele\ndecided to give the medics one more\nchance to step up against the indomitable IC pack by dropping the ball over\nthe line to give the Scum a 5-metre\nscrum.\nThe pack\u2019s opportunity came, and\nthey sure as hell didn\u2019t disappoint.\nWith another awesome heave from the\npack demonstrating IC\u2019s overall su-periority, the medic pack didn\u2019t quite\nknow what to do. The ball skipped\nout between their open-side flanker\nand their seemingly inexperienced\nscrum half was just not quick enough\nto compete with the eager snatchings\nof Penfold, who successfully poached\nthe ball from the back of the scrum,\nplacing it just over the line to put the\nscore at 29-24. Fresher debutant, Jack,\nably converted this try to put the final\nscore at 31-24.\nAs the final whistle sounded minutes\nlater, the boys in blue knew that they\nhad done what they came to do - shown\nthe Scum what they are capable of and\nwhat the remaining two encounters\nhave in store for the medics.\nand 6th (out of 25) in the beginner category and 4th (out of 22) in the novice category. These excellent results\nindicate great potential for many wins\nduring the coming year. The most impressive result was from the women\u2019s\nstudent beginner eight, which beat 15\nother crews to come first by over 30\nseconds in a time of 11 minutes, 45\nseconds.\nIn addition, the quality of coxing was\nevident on an extremely narrow river\nthat is notoriously difficult to steer.\nWhile in past years there have been\nproblems on some of the tighter bends,\nthere were no collisions this year, and\nthe new intake of coxes should be commended on their ability to bring home\nan undamaged set of boats! After travelling home, the celebrations were carried out in suitable fashion, in various\nbars around Fulham!\nThis first race has been an excellent\nresult, and marks the beginning of a\nsuccessful race season for the novice\nsquad. Well done to all who raced!\nRowing novices\u2019 maiden win\nIain Palmer\nThe 3rds celebrating their win in the bar after the game\nWomen\u2019s novices in action Mmm, pasta!\n\n"

The lengthy train\njourney clearly took its toll on Imperial\u2019s fencers and with Ez Hassan absent with the University of London Air\nSquadron and new man Alex Bishop\nreportedly suffering from leukaemia,\nthey were bound to struggle.\nThe match started with sabre and\nLuka Lukic was given the all important\nanchor position, seeing away his first\nopponent 5 \u2013 4. Both Will Hoy and\nteam captain Maurice Berk enjoyed\n5 \u2013 2 victories in their first matches,\nputting Imperial 15 \u2013 8 ahead after\nthe initial round. Maurice, Luka and\nWill then all won their second round\nmatches 5 \u2013 2 to further increase the\nlead to 30 \u2013 14 with everything proceeding according to plan. Maurice\nwas made to work hard for his 5 \u2013 4\nfinal victory against the opposition\ncaptain while Will won his last match\n5 \u2013 3. Portsmouth were not quite ready\nto give up, it seemed, as Luka struggled\nhis way to a 5 \u2013 9 defeat in the final sabre match, leaving the score at 45 \u2013 30\nfor that weapon.\nNext up was \u00e9pe\u00e9 and it was here\nthat Portsmouth started to threaten.\nMaurice went down to a 4 \u2013 5 defeat\nagainst the opposition captain in the\nopening match before Luka put Imperial in front after a 6 \u2013 4 victory. With\nboth Ez and Alex absent and after getting his first taste of competitive \u00e9pe\u00e9\nlast week, Nathan Blundell was Imperial\u2019s third man and he kept them in\nthe lead with a 5 \u2013 5 draw in his first\nmatch. Maurice then comfortably beat\nhis next opponent 5 \u2013 2 while Nathan\nagain drew 5 \u2013 5. Luka saw off his second opponent 5 \u2013 4 before Nathan\nfinally got the hang of it and won 5 \u2013\n1. With Imperial 35 \u2013 26 in the lead\nfor \u00e9pe\u00e9 before the final two matches\nthey seemed well in control yet Portsmouth had other plans. Maurice was\ndefeated 2 \u2013 7 in a match that went to\ntime while Luka suffered a 7 \u2013 12 defeat at the hands of the Portsmouth\ncaptain to leave the final score for \u00e9pe\u00e9\n44 \u2013 45 in Portsmouth\u2019s favour and\nthe Imperial team wondering whether\noverconfidence might prove to be their\ndownfall.\nImperial were still 14 points in the\nlead going into foil, traditionally their\nstrongest weapon. It was, however, an\nunder strength foil side with Will initially standing in for the absentees and\nLuka nominated as a reserve. Things\nstarted particularly badly with Norris going down to a 1 \u2013 5 defeat at the\nhands of the opposition captain before\nNathan restored the lead with a remarkable 9 \u2013 3 victory. Will struggled\nagainst his opponent 4 \u2013 7 and Luka\nwas nominated to replace him for his\nremaining two matches. Norris redeemed himself with an excellent 6 \u2013 0\nwin while Luka could only managed a\n5 \u2013 5 draw in his first match. Nathan\nand Luka both comfortably won their\nnext matches 5 \u2013 2, putting the game\nbeyond doubt with Imperial 20 points\nin the lead and only 16 to play for. Norris drew against his final opponent 5 \u2013\n5 before the opposition captain again\ncreated problems, this time serving up\na 5 \u2013 7 defeat to Nathan.

Felix takes best travel writer award\nChanges to the Chemistry Department\u2019s policy on demonstrating have\nleft many second year PhD students\nbelieving that they have been unpaid\nfor hours worked last year.\nScience departments across the\ncountry rely on PhDs to supervise\nexperiments in their undergraduate\nteaching laboratories. Many students\ncome to rely on money earned this way\nto supplement their basic stipend.\nHowever,lastyearImperial\u2019sChemistry Department stopped making direct\npayments to departmentally funded\nPhDs for this work. The new students,\nwho are now in their second year, were\ninstead required to complete a yearly\nquota of 100 hours. Existing PhDs,\nwho chose to do work demonstrating,\nwere paid directly for their time.\nFollowing unrest from the postgraduate community, the department has\nnow reversed this decision, and as of\nOctober this year, all PhDs will be paid\nfor demonstrating at the standard rate\nAndrew Turley of \u00a311.60 per hour. A student working\n100 hours would earn \u00a31,160.\nThese payments however, will not\nbe extended to cover hours completed\nlast year. Some have suggested the department has squeezed the postgraduate community in order to offset its\nburgeoning teaching bill.\nSpeaking on behalf of the Chemistry department, Professor James Durrant, Director of Postgraduate Studies,\nrefuted claims that second year PhDs\nhave been left uncompensated.\nHe said: \u201cIn 2006 we implemented a\nscheme whereby all PhD students were\nrequired to participate in demonstrat-ing; in return the department contributed to the overall PhD stipend. This\nchange was made to distribute demonstrating more equitably amongst the\nstudents, which we see as a valuable\npart of their training. However, the\ndepartmental contribution made by\nthis route was less visible than via the\nhistoric method of direct payment, as\nit was factored into the basic stipend,\nand resulted in some students feeling\nthat they were doing unpaid work.\n\u201cOn reviewing PhD funding for\n2007-2008, we decided that the mechanism introduced in 2006 was overall\nnot beneficial and so reverted to direct\npayment for hours worked. This was\npartly because of the damaging, but\nunfounded, perception that students\nwere doing unpaid work, and partly to\nensure that those students who take on\ndemonstrating roles are in fact motivated to do so.\u201d\nAccording to the affected students\nhowever, the individual stipends were\nnot significantly increased for the\n2006-2007 year. They received \u00a314,300,\nmuch in line with other departments\nat Imperial, and elsewhere in London.\nInstead the money went into the overall departmental contribution and was\nused to fund additional studentships,\nsomething the department informed\nthem of at the start of the year.\nThey also claim they had not been\nmade aware of these obligations before\narriving in 2006, despite insistence to\nthe contrary from the department.\nThe Chemistry department where some second year PhD students\nhave reported they felt they were doing unpaid work\nPhD students left unpaid for demonstrating work?\nStudents voice their opinions\non Union\u2019s bars and catering\nL\nast week on Wednesday,\nUnion staff members along\nwith Deputy President (Fi-nance & Services) Chris\nLarvin held this term\u2019s\nTrading Forum. Students were invited\nto air their views on the Union\u2019s bars\nand catering outlets.\nThe event was very successful even\nthough Mr Larvin admitted that he\nwas \u201csceptical\u201d before the event about\nhow many students would turn up.\nAround 30 people attended the Forum;\na far better turnout that last year.\nThe main complaints were about\nthe speed of service, most notably in\ndB\u2019s where some customers have been\nleft queuing whilst the staff watch the\npanini press do its work. Similarly,\nDa Vinci\u2019s was also criticised because\nqueuing times have forced students\nto eat elsewhere on campus.

It helped voice the opinions\nof many students who were angry with\nthe TfL (Transport for London) because they had been overcharged when\nusing their Oyster cards, resulting in\nthe BBC picking up on the story.\nThe Guardian Media Awards pan-ellists praised Live! for its frequently\nupdated content, its use of video material partly thanks to stoictv and also\nbecause of its active interaction with\nstudents through its message boards.\nOne notable article over the summer\nperiod generated 185 replies; the posts\nlargely consisted of many angry Wye\nstudents disappointed with their degree results.\nLive!

This not only allows us to get\na broader picture of said title, but also\nlets the readers get more involved and\nhave their say. So, don\u2019t worry if your\ncomments don\u2019t agree with that of the\nmain review - your opinions are yours\nto express and we wouldn\u2019t want it any\nother way.\nNow, you may be wondering why\nwe\u2019re reviewing Portal so late since\nthe Internets is already brimming with\npraises and much orgasmic lyrical wax-ing. We believe that we shouldn\u2019t just\nrush through a game just for the sake\nof reviewing it. Rather, it\u2019s about experiencing the game like it was meant to\nbe and then expressing our thoughts in\nliterary form. It sounds a bit haughty,\nbut Felix Games is about being differ-ent. That\u2019s why we strive to give you\nso much more. It\u2019s not only about the\ngames, but about the exciting medium\nof interactive, digital entertainment.\nWe love to explore not only the depths\nbut the breadth of this insane industry.\nAnd we definitely want you to join us\nfor this journey.\nGairaigo returns this week with a\nlook at Katamari Damacy which made\na bit of a splash on the Internet a few\nyears back. While you may think it\u2019s a\nwaste to be focusing on a old game, I\nthink it tells much about what makes\ncertain games special. Katamari\nDamacy isn\u2019t the kind of game you can\neasily forget about and particularly not\nwhen the King of All-Cosmos is such\na random, effed-up character. He offers some genuine \u201cWTF?\u201d moments\nand you\u2019ll be surprised at how eagerly\nyou look forward to his next flippant\nspeech. Gotta love that freak.\nI\u2019d like to point out that the Christmas Term is almost up. I would like\nmake a request for your feedback on\nthe section so we can kick some more\nass come Spring. E-mail your opinions\nto games.felix@imperial.ac.uk.\nThis\nWeek\nWhile true, run through\nMama, I\u2019m scared!\nReader Riposte\nAll hail the Companion Cube A return to roots\nSebastian Nordgren opens a portal to another dimension, all for the sake of cake\n\u201cT\nhis was a triumph.\nI\u2019m making a note\nhere: huge success.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate my satisfaction.\u201d Rarely has the ending of a game\nso fully represented the feelings of the\nplayer as these lines sung by the lilt-ing, robotic voice of Portal\u2019s antagonist\nGLaDOS. What Portal really highlights\nis Valve\u2019s ability to acquire an idea and\nmorph it into something so much better - in this case not Counter-Strike\nor Day of Defeat, but the little-known\nNarbacular Drop.\nFor all 12 of you who played Narbacular Drop, it was a clever little puzzle game about a princess escaping a\ncastle, overcoming obstacles with a\nwand that could create, unsurprisingly,\nportals. What Valve have done is take\na great gameplay idea and wrap it in\nlayer upon layer of meat (or soy bean\nfor the carnivorously challenged) and\ncreated a shockingly good game. Instead of merely porting the concept to\nthe Source engine, they hired the lead\nwriter of Psychonauts and expended\nan enormous amount of effort in creating one of the funniest games since\nthe late LucasArts\u2019 adventure games.\nAnd it works.\nIt works so well, in fact, that the\n2-3 hour mind-bending puzzler is\none that will live on in the collective\nconsciousness far longer than any of\nthe other excellent games they packaged into The Orange Box. Not only is\nthe gameplay excellently twisted, but\nthroughout the game the anonymous\nprotagonist is jeered on by the oddly\nreassuring robotic voice of GLaDOS\n(a cunning word-play on Gladys). In an\noddly backwards way, your antagonist\nbecomes the main character, as she\nchanges from a deadpan lab coordinator to menacing to desperate to so\nmany other states of mind - all while\ndropping casual off-the-cuff remarks\nlike \u201cif you feel faint from thirst, feel\nfree to pass out\u201d and \u201cthank you for\nhelping us help you help us all\u201d. And\nin the final fight, each layer of her personality is stripped away individually,\nshowing how multi-faceted all of us\nreally are.\nAnd while Portal\u2019s enjoyment is\nlargely independent of narrative, it\u2019s a\ntestament to Valve that they\u2019ve managed to weave in so much humour with\nso little material. Instead of having an\nall-encompassing philosophical view\nof the world like BioShock with its Ayn\nRandian objectivism, Portal\u2019s narrative\nis about cake because (in the words of\nthe lead writer) \u201ceveryone likes cake\u201d.\nTurrets plead at you to come out of hid-ing, declaring \u201cNap time!\u201d if they don\u2019t\nfind you, incineration is referred to as\neuthanisation and it\u2019s all distorted by\nthe sort of politically correct nonsense\nthat permeates society today. Even\ncrates get their share of the attention,\nwith the absurdly-named Weighted\nCompanion Cube, emblazoned on all\n6 sides with a little pink heart - good\nfor at least a hearty chuckle. And then\none finds pictures of the little fellow\nsuperimposed on pictures of Marilyn\nMonroe and Charlie Chaplin... In a\nway, this is what Psychonauts should\nhave been - a hilarious game with fun\ngameplay, instead of the cack-handed\nplatforming that ultimately made it so\nfrustrating.\nPortalisremarkablebecauseitdoesn\u2019t\njust have one of those \u201cwhy didn\u2019t anyone think of this\u201d concepts behind it,\nand it\u2019s not just excellently executed\ngameplay-wise, but because it does all\nthose things and adds in a generous\nsprinkle of good old-fashioned black\nhumour that is completely unnecessary\nfor the core game. So, if you don\u2019t own\nThe Orange Box yet, you really should\nbuy it for Portal alone. It\u2019s a landmark\ngame, packing more enjoyment into 3\nhours than Titanic and showcasing a\nfact that us gamers have been aware\nof for quite some time - that games are\nsuperior to any other medium when\ndone this well.\nAnd remember, the cake is a lie.\nOne level. Two Portals. And a multitude of ways to solve it Portal messes with your mind\nAh, Portal - one of the latest progenitors of a whole new series of Internet memes and a true successor to \u201cIt is delicious cake. You must eat it.\u201d\nReview\n\n"

    "content": "business.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBusiness\nBusiness Editor \u2013 Afonso Campos\nBarclays\u2019 disturbing history\nA quick voyage through the household banking firm\u2019s somewhat dubious past\nAfonso Campos\nBusiness Editor\nI\ndo not tend to go out on massive rants and rarely do I ever\nvoice my opinion in such public a manner, but not too long\nago, I was utterly bemused by a\ncomment regarding a fad that has been\ngoing on for a while in the investment\nworld.\nI was out with an old school friend\nand we were kicking the old peanut\naround when the conversation turned\nslightly more serious and borderline\npretentious. As wine poured into his\ngormandising gullet, massive amounts\nof bullshit spewed out of it. He told me\nhe was now \u201cplaying the stock market\u201d. I tend to chuckle at phrases of the\nsort, because more often than not, this\nsupposed \u201cgame\u201d involves an under-informed, underage kid throwing his\ncash away on a whim because the name\nof a particular security sounds mildly\nexotic. Either that, or it reminds him\nof the name of his ridiculous pet hamster or stupid goldfish. Not wanting\nto seem like a smug idiot, I asked him\nwhat sectors he was into at the moment and why; \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d he replied\nrather (a)pathetically, \u201cI\u2019ll put money\non anything that\u2019s either carbon neutral or negative. You know\u2026 because\nof the thing, the whole responsible investing malarkeybob\u201d.\nLet\u2019s sneakily skip over the fact that\nthe most irresponsible type of investing is the moronic kind where you have\nno clue what\u2019s going on or what you\nare doing. I have a tough time comprehending this concept of \u201cethical investing\u201d. I know it entails not touching\nstocks of companies with a 10ft pole if\nthey are even in some remote amd pn-scire way connected to a myriad of less\nthan socially acceptable endeavours.\nThese include, but are not limited to\ncompanies linked to: arms, gambling,\nchild labour, tobacco, booze, sex indus-try, environmentally unfriendly firms,\noil and of course, baby stealing and\ntrading.\nWhat I don\u2019t understand however,\nis why you wouldn\u2019t invest in them. I\ncan speculate and guess it probably has\nsomething to do with a vain fear you\nmay have of being labelled a supporter\nof any of the highly noble causes just\nmentioned.\nIn all fairness, whether you invest\nbecause you like the thrill of knowing\nyour decision was correct, enjoy the\nacademic side of trading or are just\na whore for cash, there is one goal.\nThis goal is that of supernormal alpha\n-making more money than leaving it in\na completely stagnant long-only fund\nfor old grannies returning a measly\n3%, or underperforming most market\naverages.\nIf you are serious about your goal,\nthis concept of ethical investment\nmust be abandoned; markets aren\u2019t\nfor sissies. They are for those who can\nstomach pretty much anything, from\nkiller losses to insults of the most disgusting kind.\nNow, get off your high horse, go\nmake some serious bucks and make\nme proud, son.\nB\narclays \u2013 the 17th century\nbank that has become more\nthan a household name.\nIt has become a British\ninstitution to the world.\nThe name is recognised in any of the\nfour corners, and has been subject of\npress clippings day in, day out for the\nlast the seven months due to the now\nwithdrawn bid for Dutch powerhouse\nABN Amro.\nOne would expect a long-standing\ncompany with such visibility, scope,\nand reach to be the pinnacle of ethics\nin the world of finance. Most people\nstill see this facet of the well known\nbrand. The bank has even received a\nfew awards in years past due to their\nsupposed modus operandi with a de-ontological code the College of Surgeons would probably kill for. In fact,\nmost people have no trouble rushing to\nuse all of their commercial and investment banking services through a wide\nnetwork of \u2018daughter\u2019 institutions. At\nfirst sight, this makes perfect sense.\nBarclays does after all have more assets\nunder management than the GDP of\nsome large European countries.\nWhat most people are not aware of\nthough, is that the \u2018can do no wrong\u2019\nfinancial mammoth has actually been\ninvolved in a significant number of\nmassive social scandals throughout its\nhistory. Some of them recent, others\nnot so much.\nMost semi-intelligent, reasonably\neducated and aware citizens of any\nnation where information is not completely biased by the powers that be\nhave heard of Robert Mugabe\u2019s oppressive and corrupt regime in Zimbabwe.\nMany will not however know that it is\nmainly Barclays Bank (along with some\nsmaller houses) that is bankrolling the\nrather sickening state of affairs in the\nAfrican nation. Barclays\u2019 biggest loan\nso far has aided Mugabe and close supporters to take control of land owned\nby over 3000 white farmers. It has also\nled to the expulsion of 100,000 black\nfarmers from their homes and the\nkicking out of over 1,000,000 people\nout from the capital for opposing the\nregime. This specific loan totals over\n$60,000,000 and has come mostly in\nthe form of Barclays snapping up and\nbuying government paper and t-bills.\nThe loans so far total a staggering $1.5\nbillion in the first half of the year alone.\nIt is sad that such a figure has the effect\nof dropping jaws and opening eyes, but\nthe insane cruelty that is going on has\nnot been able to do the same and press\nfor greater pressure from the rest of the\nplanet. Even Zimbabwe\u2019s closest neighbour has chosen to turn a blind eye to\nthe problem. We can only speculate\nwhat is going to happen in the future,\nbut one thing is almost dead certain \u2013\nfinancial institutions like Barclays will\nalways play a role in helping dictators\nmake their doctrine and play their people like pawns.\nBarclays history of supporting tyra-neous and destructive regimes does\nnot end here. About a decade ago, the\nbank has been found to be financing\none of the world\u2019s most environmentally unfriendly companies \u2013 Asian\nPulp and Paper. While most people\nare not terribly interested in what is\ngoing on anywhere but where they\nlive, the Friends of the Earth Foundation has made a difference and found\nout Barclays has had direct impact and\ninfluence in organsing and raising over\n$800 million worth of loans for APP\nover the period of 1990 to 1996. To put\nthings slightly into perspective, these\nmonies have helped the company tear\naway over 600,000 hectares of incredibly wild-life rich Indonesian rain for-est. This is roughly five times the size\nof greater London.\nIf that were not enough, the Bank\nhas recently been accused by Members of Parliament right here at home\nof essentially ripping off the National\nHealth Service and therefore, you, the\ntaxpayer. The report commissioned by\nthese MPs has found that the bank par-took, in conjunction with other high\nprofile companies (including the private equity giant 3i), in some pretty im-pressive, somewhat obscure accounting trickery to make money seemingly\nout of thin air. The head of this consortium of companies successfully found\na way of increasing NHS borrowings\nby more than 50% to build a private\nhospital. Some leveraging, regearing\nand restructuring of this extra capital meant that the group managed to\nmake circa \u00a382 million extra from this\ndeal. Playing around with the taxpayers money in such a fashion is a clear\nabuse of capitalism and a down right\nsmack in the face of all the citizens and\nworkers who struggle to pay their taxes\nevery year.\nWe will not see the end of this tomfoolery any time soon. Financial institutions play too large a part in a\ncountry\u2019s stability and are too deeply\nentwined with policy making bodies\nfor there to be any real change.\nA.

No one. Then again\nI don\u2019t think anyone expected her to\nstill be making albums let alone be on\nher kill-me-now-the-world-has-gone-crazy 5th studio LP. It seems Britney has managed to escape the mid-noughties slaughter of pop princesses\nthe same way Madonna escaped the\nculling of the pop stars from whatever\npre-historic era she is from \u2013 by constantly changing her image.\nEveryone knows how so utterly brilliant Madge is at this but don\u2019t forget\nthat her lesbian make-out partner,\nBritney, has also undergone some\nspectacular transformations. She\u2019s\ngone from slutty schoolgirl (\u201cBaby,\nOne More Time\u201d) to tight cat-suit clad\nseductress (\u201cOops, I Did It Again\u201d).\nThen came the snake-charming,\nmidriff-baring dance diva who has no\nobjections to having her faced licked\n(\u201cI\u2019m A Slave 4 U\u201d) followed by a clumsy flight attendant willing to make out\nwith an obese gentleman in the toilets\nafter spilling a beverage on his crotch\n(\u201cIn The Zone\u201d). But the one constant\nwith all these personas Brit has adopted in the past, I\u2019m sure you will agree\nis that they have all oozed sex appeal.\nThe difference with the release of her\nlatest album, \u201cBlackout\u201d, is there is no\nmillion dollar music video to accompany the album and the media has no\nqualms with portraying her as an alco-holic, baby-dropping, divorced moth-er-of-two. An image which doesn\u2019t\nreally lend itself to the adjective \u2018sexy\u2019\nunless, of course, you\u2019re into that sort\nof thing, in which case this must be like\na wet dream come true.\nBut that\u2019s okay, right? I mean with all\nthe things going on in Brit\u2019s life right\nnow and the changes she has been\nthrough since she was \u201cIn the Zone\u201d\nyou\u2019d think she has more than enough\nfodder to deliver an album with something to say. A few scores to settle (JT?\nK-Fed? The media?), a couple of myths\nto dispel \u2013 did kissing Madonna really mean she needed surgery on her\nlips afterwards? What happened to\nher underwear on the infamous night\nout with the girls? \u2013 and a whole lot of\nexplaining to do (The haircut? where\nis the real video for \u201cGimme More\u201d?).\nWith all these experiences to draw from\n[Enter pun taken straight for thelondonpaper, London Lite or Metro talking about\nBritney Spears here for minimal comic effect and devaluation of our self-worth]\nMatty Hoban\nMusic Editor\nI\nplayed at a gig last night in East\nLondon, and it was fun even\nthough we played to a very\nempty venue. The latter fact did\nnot bother me in the slightest\nbecause I did actually have a ton of\nfun, not in the sun or in your mum.\nHowever on my way home, I had my\nusual thoughts about gigs and things\nand the music business in general.\nForming a band is something a lot\nof people do, so it alarms me when\npeople in a band relish and adore the\nattention they get as if they are gods\namongst men. The British music press\nis probably to blame because they are\nconstantly idolising individuals and\nvisionaries and reinforcing the idea\nthe whole rock star ideal. Forming a\nband should be about having fun and\nsatisfying your inner audience. The\nmost satisfying bands I have seen just\ndo what feels right to them and fuck\nthe rest.\nThe band that to me demonstrates\nthe fun over phallusy factor is Pavement; they are perhaps the best band\nthat ever existed. They did not just\nwrite songs, they played with the idea\nof a song until that idea became something resembling a song. The most\nchallenging thing to do when you are\nin a band is to actually think about\nwhat sounds \u2018right\u2019 but then what\ndoes \u2018right\u2019 actually mean? It is elusive\nand sometimes is actually wrong. You\ncan actually be right by being wrong.\nAnyway, I\u2019m blathering on.\nChances are, your band is okay and\nyou have some songs which sound\nright to you. You might even find a\nsmall audience whose concept of right\nmatches up with yours or they just\nthink you sound like their favourite\nband. Either way, you persevere with\nwhat you are doing and you play more\ngigs. Logically, the more gigs you play,\nthe more likely you are to acquire\nmore fans. Soon, you\u2019ll have record\nlabels nipping at your ankles and supporting Bloc Party at Wembley.\nWrong! No-one owes you anything\nand the powers that be, ie. most high-level promoters, record labels and\nA&R people do not actually care about\nmusic. They care about bums on\nseats and sustainability. Myspace has\njust made everything worse meaning\npeople wanting to become promoters\nand start record labels have a footing\nand can begin their exploitation. I say\nexploitation because for promoters\nand middlemen it is impossible for\nthem to make any money whatsoever\nsince venue hire fees are ridiculously\nhigh and barely no-one wants to pay\nmoney to see a band they have never\nheard of. In order for promoters to\nmake money they cannot possibly afford to pay the bands.\nThe only way to usurp all this\nnonsense is to avoid shady looking\npromoters, take more power into\nyour own hands and just have fun\nand make music for yourselves; you\u2019ll\nstand out more from everything. Also,\nif you are a London band, do not just\nstart gigging as much as possible; your\nfriends are your first fanbase; gig occasionally and make it an occasion.\nBritney Spears\nBlackout (Jive)\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\u2729\nAlbum Review\nshe might be just be about to deliver\nthe best work of her career. A body\nof work some might even describe as\nbeing a \u2018classic\u2019. Wrong. \u201cBlackout\u201d is\nmerely an update of her last album \u2013\nfun, whimsical but relentlessly imper-sonal. In fact, Paris Hilton could have\nrecorded the very same album and not\nhad to change a thing about it.\nThat\u2019s not say that it is as bad. Honestly, it is probably better than anyone\nexpected \u2013 the super-producers recruited for the project make sure she\u2019s\nup to date style-wise and that she is\nnever left wanting for a hypnotic beat.\nThis time around she does sound a\nwhole lot more robotic than usual and\nthe noticeable absence of ballads is\nalso a let down seeing as this is one\narea she has improved on during her\ncareer (\u201cI\u2019m Not A Girl\u201d, \u201cEverytime\u201d).\nI think I deserve a medal for this re-view. Not because it is particularly\ngood (dearest reader I would never be\nso presumptious), but because I just\nhad to listen through \u201cSongs About\nGirls\u201d, the new album by the Black Eyed\nPeas\u2019 Will.I.Am, which is probably one\nof the worst pile of bollocks albums I\nhave ever heard. It\u2019s like war crimes\nhave been committed on my senses;\nmy ears and face. I feel physically ill.\nIt pains me to have to write such a\nscathing review for a producer with\nso much potential. Previous to this re-lease, he had been slowly building up\nhis solo fan base with guest spots on,\namongst others, Justin Timberlake\u2019s\n\u201cDamn Girl\u201d as well as Talib Kweli\u2019s\nbuttery smooth \u201cHot Thing\u201d, both of\nwhich have been scaling the heights of\nmy Last.fm for a good few weeks now.\nI suppose this is why I found it such\na disappointing release \u2013 after having demonstrated his excellent ear for\nfunky, hip-hoppy, take-off-your-shirt-and-dance-in-front-of-the-mirror\ntunes, he goes and releases 17 tracks\n(61 minutes and 41 seconds) of generic brainless R\u2019n\u2019B bullshit. I really\ndon\u2019t know how he thinks he can get\naway with it. Who will buy it? The only\npeople I can conceive of liking this are\nWill.I.Am\nSongs About Girls (Interscope)\n\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\u2729\nAlbum Review\n12-year-old love-sick girls, and people\nwho have given up on life entirely, both\nof which are somewhat lacking in buying power. Here\u2019s what I didn\u2019t like:\n1) It is extremely repetitive.\nThe same 5 seconds of music repeated over and over again in each and\nevery song. No innovation or variation for minutes at a time. If they were\nparticularly catchy hooks, it may be\nforgivable, but they aren\u2019t even close.\nPure filler.\n2) Will.I.Am\u2019s voice is lazy and slow.\nIt\u2019s as if he just can\u2019t be bothered. He\ndoesn\u2019t want to be there, he doesn\u2019t\ncare, he knows it\u2019s bad, and he just\nwants to go home and pretend it never\nhappened.\n3) The beats are slow, uninteresting\nand uninspiring.\nThey don\u2019t change for entire songs!\nWhat is the point?\n4) The lyrics are absolutely devoid of\nWill.I.Am or Will.I.Am.Not, that is some sort of question?\nThe problem is when an artist\u2019s 5th\nalbum sounds like a modernised and\nmore provocative version of her debut\nit begs the question \u2013 why bother?\nThere are few songs worth giving a\nlisten. These include the Danja-produced \u201cGimme More\u201d which she royally screwed up during that performance\nat the MTV awards, the paparazzi-bashing \u201cPiece of Me\u201d, which sees her\ntaking a swing at the media for, \u201cPrinting pictures of her derriere in the magazine\u201d and is rumoured to be the next\nsingle off the album. Other stand-outs\nare \u201cHot as Ice\u201d, which features the\ndumbest chorus ever but still manages\nto shine despite it, and the terrific \u201cToy\nSoldier\u201d. It looks like Britney messed\nup the formula this time but just might\nend up getting away with it.\nJemil Salami\nlyricism.\nYou can find more insight on a box of\ncornflakes. Recurring themes are: girls;\nmoney. Yes, it\u2019s a full stop; there are no\nmore! It must be said, there are some\ngems in this category though, I guess\ndue to Will.I.Am\u2019s poor grasp of irony,\nand a failed editing process.\nSome good points to provide a bit of\nbalance:\nUm. There is a picture of him wearing a very nice suit in the album art.\nOh, and the CD came in one of those\nnew shatter-proof cases. Pretty fancy.\nWell, I think Will.I.Am himself sums\nup his own album on the penultimate\ntrack \u201cSpending Money\u201d, when the\nline \u201cI got nothing but money, honey!\u201d\nis repeated over and over. Really, he\ncouldn\u2019t be more right: no talent, no\nwit, no future \u2013 just money, honey! Oh,\nand no stars.\nPeter Sinclair\nYou can actually trace the rise and fall of the Republicans with the rise and fall of Britney; no coincidence\n\n"

    "content": "science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nFriday 23 November 2007 felix\nScience\nThe National Health Service is almost\nentirely reliant on \u2018modern\u2019 or \u2018Western\u2019 drug treatments, dubbing natural\nherbal treatments as \u2018alternative\u2019 or\n\u2018complementary\u2019 medicines.\nThe use of herbal medicines, also\nknown as botanical medicines, can be\ntraced back to around 1500 BC in ancient Egypt, where herbs were used to\nprotect people from infections. Modern day herbal remedies such as garlic\nsupplements, Echinacea and St John\u2019s\nWort, all readily available in high\nstreet health stores, are advertised to\nhelp prevent illness: Echinacea is prescribed for colds, while garlic is meant\nto give a general boost to the system.\nChinese medicine stores, which promote natural medicines that have been\nused for thousands of years, are also\nvery common.\nHowever, in some cases taking complimentary herbal medicine along with\nWestern treatments can have undesired effects, with some combinations\nbeing fatal. A study by Norwegian scientists is currently investigating these\ndangers and aims to improve knowledge of this issue.\nSt John\u2019s Wort is widely taken as a\nliver detoxifier as well as to help treat\nmild to moderate depression. However,\nit is also known to \u2018kill\u2019 a lot of medica-tion, decreasing the effect of the drug\ntreatments, up to the point that they\ncan disappear altogether. For instance,\nSt John\u2019s Wort is said to weaken the effects of including birth control pills,\nViagra, and the drug that is supposed\nto aid organ acceptance by blending\nnew organs into their surroundings. St\nJohn\u2019s Wort can also increase the effect of some medicines, which can lead\nto undesirable side effects. Generally\nspeaking, St John\u2019s Worth should not\nbe taken with drugs that require a constant amount being in the blood at all\ntimes; these include drugs for cancer,\norgan transplants, HIV, epilepsy and\nmental illness.\nAnaesthetics can also be affected\nby herbal remedies: Valerian, which\nis used to calm the nerves, increases\nthe effects of the anaesthetics, whilst\nGinkgo Biloba weakens them. Scientists and doctors still do not know how\nexactly this occurs as the tests to determine this are hard. Nevertheless, they\ndo indicate that the individual effects\nof two substances can be very different\nSPECIAL\nSTUDENT\nOFFER\nSAVE 50%\nWHERE WILL IT TAKE YOU\nTHIS WEEK?\nOR GO ONLINE www.newscientist.com/s/3376\nCALL THE HOTLINE + 44 (0) 8456 731 731\n9am to 9pm, 7 days a week.

The Norwegian study found\nthat nearly half of cancer patients in\nNorway resort to herbal remedies to\nstrengthen their health, with 70% admitting to take remedies (principally\ngarlic and green tea) to boost the immune system. However, none of the\npatients was aware that there are potential risks of mixing herbal remedies\nand drug treatments.\nThe study, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology\n(NTNU), aims to improve the information that doctors and patients have.\nResearch Fellow Silje Engdal says \u201cNow\nwe know more about how many cancer\npatients actually use the herbal rem-edy, which remedies they choose and\nwhether they tell their doctor about it.\nThis information enables us to find out\nmore systematically which combinations the patients need to avoid.\u201d\nThe researchers want to enable doctors to provide patients with a list of\nherbal remedies to avoid in particular cases. This should help, provided\npeople tell their consultants if they\nare taking complementary medicines.\nThe long-term goal is to include a list\nof herbal remedies in the Physician\u2019s\nDesk Reference, a database which allows doctors to check whether multiple drugs will work together and to\ndetermine the appropriate dosage.\nAs herbal and Chinese medicines\nwill inevitably continue to be used\nwith Western medicines it is important both patients and doctors have\ngreater awareness of possible risks associated with combining these treat-ments. This study may be just what the\ndoctor ordered.\n\u201cSome\ncombinations of\nWestern & herbal\nmedicines are\npotentially fatal\u201d\nSt. John\u2019s Wort. Not quite Deadly Nightshade, but no shrinking violet either \u2013 too much of the supplement\nderived from this little number, and your new kidney transplant will be pushing up daisies\nRoses are red, Viagra\u2019s blue, and won\u2019t be of any use to you at all if\nyou\u2019re taking St. John\u2019s Wort\n\n"
