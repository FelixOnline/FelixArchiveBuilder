Expect TV escapism, highlighting women in music, and\ngoing crazy over Olivia Laing...\nD\nuring the\nAmerican\nelection cycle\non his comedy\nshow Last Week\nTonight, John\nOliver had a running gag\n\u2013 \u201clook up,\u201d he\u2019d say \u201cthat\nfaint glimmer in the distance?\nThat\u2019s rock bottom.\u201d So it has\nseemed for most of 2016;\nin almost every sphere,\nparticularly in politics, bad\nnews has been followed by\nworse news. Brexit in the\nsummer has been followed\nby the election of a man\nwho brags about sexual\nassault and, having promised\nto \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of\nand Prince earlier in the year,\nhas provided much needed\nrelief; some have been in\nthe form of escapism, others\nas rousing calls to arms.\nBeyonce released Lemonade\nin February, an album that is\nas much rooted in cinematography as in music - if you ever\nneed a pick-me-up just watch\nclips of Bey smashing cars\nwearing a glorious Cavalli\nyellow dress in Hold Up, or\nSerena Williams telling every\nman \"boy, bye\" in Sorry.\nLemonade was Beyonce's\nmost political offering to date,\ncelebrating the resilience of\nblack women in the face of\ngenerations of hardship and\ncompromise. Its message of\nhealing and self-love had\nmuch in common with Lizzo's\nsophomore offering Coconut\nOil, in which Lizzo belts out\nsome impressive vocals to a\nbackground of rich basses\nand organs. Her lyrics on the\ntitular track are comforting\nand empowering in a time\nwhen we could all do with\njust that; \u201cI thought I needed\nto run and find somebody\nto love, but all I needed was\nsome coconut oil\u201d. The album\nof the year for me however\nbelongs to another Knowles\nsister; Solange\u2019s A Seat at the\nTable is a haunting look at the\nexperience of black women\nin America, it is by turns\nlyrical, bleak and wonderfully\nuplifting.\nBy mid-November all my\nappetite for consuming\nbittersweet media had been\nused up; there was too much\nin the real world to feel sad\nabout. It was at this moment\nthat I discovered Black\nMirror\u2019s new season, in particular the fourth episode San\nJunipero. Black Mirror is a\nseries known for its darkness.\nSan Junipero, the story of\ntwo women time-travelling\nand falling in love could\neasily have conformed to\nthe pattern; their sapphic\nrelationship alone marked\nthem out for a target of a\npotentially heartbreaking\nresolution: 2016 was a year\nin which the \u2018bury your gays\u2019\ntrope prevailed in TV. In\nOrange Is the New Black,\nPoussey Washington \u2013 a fan\nfavourite \u2013 was inadvertently\nstrangled by a guard after the\npossibility of her release from\nprison and a happy future\nwith her girlfriend seemed\nwithin reach; in March, Lexa\u2019s\ndemise on the cult hit The 100\ncaused an internet outcry that\nlesbians and bisexual women\nwere being used as cannon\nfodder to generate cheap\nshock. Given Charlie Brooker\u2019s propensity to write tragic\ntwist endings, we might\u2019ve\nexpected the largely joyous\nepisode to end in a break-up,\nyet San Junipero killed off\nboth characters and allowed\nthem to ride off Thelma\nand Louise style (minus the\ncliff edge) into the sunset.\nThe subversion of the \u2018bury\nyour gays\u2019 trope, as well\nas a excellent 80s inspired\nsoundtrack (available on\nSpotify) made San Junipero\nunique not only in Brooker\u2019s\noeuvre but in TV as a whole.\nSubversion of Shakespeare\nwas at the core of Phyllida\nLloyd\u2019s return to the Donmar.\nThe Shakespeare Trilogy featured an all-female cast in The\nTempest, Henry IV, and Julius\nCaesar. The performances,\nled by a diverse cast that\nseemed to have benefited\nfrom colour-blind casting, as\nwell as featuring women in\nthe male roles, brought fresh\ninsight into the 400-year-old\nplays.\nLondon staged several high\nprofile exhibitions this year\nfrom Abstract Expressionism at the Royal Academy\nto Picasso Portraits at the\nNational Portrait Gallery. My\nfavourite remains Painting the\nModern Garden at the Royal\nAcademy. It was filled with\nbeautiful works by Sargent,\nVan Gogh, Matisse, by way\nof Klee and Kandinsky, but\nthe stand out experience of\nthe exhibition was the last\nroom \u2013 huge Monet canvases were hung so that if one\nstood in the right spot their\nentire field of vision would be\nfilled with Monet\u2019s visions of\nhis garden at Giverny.\n2016 marked the return\nof book reviews to the Arts\nsection, and my discovery of\nthe wondrous joy of reading\nanything by Olivia Laing. In\nThe Lonely City, Laing mixes\ncriticism of the artists Edward\nHopper, Andy Warhol,\nHenry Drager, and David\nWojnarowicz with her own\nexperiences of living an\nincreasingly lonely life in New\nYork; desperate for connection and yet unable to find it.\nHer chapters on Wojnarowicz, in which she describes\nthe spread of the AIDS crisis\nin New York, are particularly\nmoving. The experience of\nreading Laing is enjoyable\nnot only for the topics she\ntackles with extraordinary\nsensitivity and insight but\nthe prose itself. Whilst I\nwas reading, I found myself\ntaking breaks to photograph\nparticular turns of phrase,\nand in some instances entire\nparagraphs to send to my\nfriends; the messages would\noften be followed by my\nA seat at the (culture) roundtable\n\\\\ The world of culture and entertain-ment, reeling from\nthe loss of David\nBowie and Prince\nearlier in the year,\nhas provided us with\nmuch needed relief\n\\\\\ncronyism in Washington has\nrecently appointed oil execs\nand CEOs of Wall Street\ngiants to the highest cabinet\noffices in America.\nHappily, the world of culture\nand entertainment, reeling\nfrom the loss of David Bowie\n\\\\ The experience\nof reading Laing is\nenjoyable not only\nfor the topics she\ntackles with extraordinary sensitivity\nand insight but the\nprose itself \\\\\ncogent commentary - a frenzy\nof exclamation marks.\nIncoherent glee was also my\nreaction to the Ghostbusters\nreboot. I\u2019ll be honest \u2013 the\n2016 made us wanna lie down amongst aesthetic potted plants and never get up too \\\\ Cranes in the Sky \\ SolangeKnowlesVEVO\nfirst time I went to see it I was\nmostly exercising my personal\nform of protest against the\nReddit and 4chan users who\nhad spent the months preceding its release rubbishing it\nwhenever possible, but the\nnext two times I went were to\nenjoy the pure cheesy fun. It\nmay not have been critically\nacclaimed but it was a movie\nin which the female cast got\nto save the world and did not\nhave to look cute whilst doing\nit, that itself being worthy of\ncelebration.\nIndira Mallik\n\u00a7\nS\ntarting with the\ndeath of David\nBowie, and\nfinishing with a\ndeeply shocking\nhumanitarian crisis\nin Syria, 2016 has officially\nbeen A Very Bad Thing.\nAlong the way, we\u2019ve seen\nthe rise of far-right populism,\nthe election of a bully to the\nhighest political office, and\nthe death of numerous icons.\nIs it any surprise that in this\nterrible year, people want\nto escape back into simpler\npleasures of the past? This\nmight explain the success of\nStranger Things \u2013 scripted\nand directed by the Duffer\nBrothers, Stranger Things\nmined our collective nostalgia\nfor the 1980s (even among\nthose not born yet), layering\nreferences to films like ET, The\nGoonies, and Firestarter over\na brilliantly pulsing electronic\nsoundtrack. Featuring a\nshady government research\nfacility, a small town hiding\ndark secrets, and queen of\nthe universe Barb, Stranger\nThings was an 8-hour escape\nfrom the horrible going-ons in\nthe world.\nWhile my two favourite\nbooks of the year might be\nwildly different in tone, they\nshare a common landscape.\nIn the non-fiction corner is The\nLonely City (Verso), by Olivia\nLaing, a deeply moving\nportrait of the New York arts\nscene throughout the 20th\ncen-tury; Laing weaves her own\npersonal narrative through\nthe stories of luminaries\nlike Andy Warhol, Edward\nHopper, and Joseph Cornell,\nall told through her brilliantly\nlucid writing style. The chapter on David Wojnarowicz,\nan artist-cum-activist who died\nof AIDS in 1992, is hauntingly\nmoving \u2013 Laing balances\nextreme melancholy at fallout\nfrom the AIDS crisis with a\nrighteous anger at those who\nallowed it to continue. In the\nfiction corner, meanwhile, is\nClare-Louise Bennett\u2019s Pond\n(Fitzcaraldo), a collection of\ninterconnected short stories\nrevolving around a woman\nliving alone on the coast of\nan unknown town. Bennett\u2019s\nfirst collection, it displays her\nmastery of language, which\nshe uses to craft a series\nof strange, beguiling tales,\ncentring on the narrator\u2019s\nrich interior life; from broken\ncookers to coveted ottomans,\nthe line between the physical\nand the psychological is\nblurred by Bennett in an\nunnerving way. Both Pond\nand The Lonely City speak\nto the virtues of solitude\nand quiet thought, but also\nremind us that there is a fine\nline between looking inwards\nand becoming isolated. Most\nimportantly, they both remind\nus that being alone and being\nlonely are quite different\nthings.\nThose interested in my\nfavourite films of the year can\nflick over to the Film section\nfor a complete breakdown\nof my top ten, but for me the\nmost underrated film of the\nyear was Lucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107\u2019s Evolution, an unsettling\nwork of body horror whose\nimagery burned itself onto\nmy retinas long after I left the\ncinema. Centring around an\nall-white village on a black\nsand coast, whose sole inhabitants are young boys and\npale nurses, Evolution plays\nout like the most horrific combination of Michael Haneke\nand David Cronenberg\nyou could imaging. Utterly\nchilling.\nWhile white women may\nhave turned on their brown\nand black sisters in the US\nelection, choosing a man\nwho boasts of \u201cgrabbing\nwomen by the pussy\u201d over\nthe first female candidate for\na major party, in music, 2016\nhas definitively belonged\nto women. Angel Olsen\u2019s\nMy Woman was a fierce\nstatement of intent, different\nenough from her breakout\n2014 album Burn Your Fire\nFor No Witness for it to be\nexciting, but retaining its\nsubtle force. Mistki, mean-while, finally broke through\nwith Puberty 2, after three\nprevious excellent albums;\nsinging about themes ranging\nfrom heartache to trying to fit\nin as an East Asian woman in\nmodern America, Puberty 2\nhighlights Mitski\u2019s clever lyrics\nand deft shredding. \"Your\nmother wouldn\u2019t approve of\nhow my mother raised me,\"\nshe sings on My Best American Girl, \"but I do, I finally\ndo\" \u2013 you can almost imagine\nher steady gaze as she sings\nthese lyrics. For me, the\nbest album of the year was\nSolange\u2019s A Seat at the Table,\nwhich takes stock of what it\nmeans to be black in America\ntoday, with Solange daring\nto display her heart and\nanger on her sleeve. The most\nexciting discovery, mean-while, was Kadjha Bonet, an\nLA-based multi-instrumentalist\nwhose debut EP The Visitor\nmines funk, soul, R&B, and so\nmuch more, to create a beau-tiful, cohesive whole.\nIn terms of theatre, I haven\u2019t\nexplored much outside that\nwhich has been on at the\nNational Theatre, given\ntheir brilliant \u00a35 tickets for\nunder-26s; that being said, I\nthought that their production\nof The Threepenny Opera\nwas phenomenal, bringing\nall the sharp-edged wit and\ndark humour we would\nexpect from a Brecht piece.\nRory Kinear was excellent\nas Macheath, but it was the\nsupporting cast that stole the\nshow, particularly Sharon\nSmall\u2019s tragic Jenny Diver\nand Nick Holder\u2019s terrifying\ncross-dressing Mr Peachum.\nIn the art world, 2016\nhas been a year of firsts:\nthe RA did their first major\nretrospective of the abstract\nexpressionists since the\n1950s; Tate Modern did their\nfirst Robert Rauschenberg\nretrospective since the artist\u2019s\ndeath; and the Whitechapel\nGallery ran the first exhibition\ncentring on electronic art.\nMy favourite exhibition was\nthe Tate Modern\u2019s Georgia\nO\u2019Keeffe retrospective, which\nshowed her as a giant of\nAmerican modernism, whose\nwork far extends past the\nflower paintings for which\nshe is best known. From the\nstrange landscapes of New\nMexico, to the celebratory\npaintings of New York,\nO\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work presents the\nfamiliar in strange and unexpected ways \u2013 the exhibition,\nwhich displayed many works\nnever seen outside the USA,\nwas a complete triumph.\nFred Fyles\nAwesome ladies saved 2016 \\\\ SolangeKnowlesVEVO, Columbia Pictures, Netflix, Jonathan Ring, Alfred Stieglitz, Pavel Antonov, Paul\nSmithies (diymag.com), rocbeyonce /Wikimedia Commons, Jabari Jacobs (atalanticrecords.com).

Arrival\nIntelligent sci-fi films are rare, with ones\ninvolving aliens rarer still. Arrival uses\nthese foreign beings to examine how\nlanguage shapes our view of the world,\nhow it can be the source of conflict but\nalso how it can be the solution. This\nyear, miscommunication has divided our\nworld, which is why Arrival is not just\nimportant, it\u2019s necessary.\n2. Paterson\nPaterson is much more a poem than\nit is a film. It doesn\u2019t have a captivating\nplot or complex character development;\nit follows a bus driver/poet around in a\nquiet city for a week. It doesn\u2019t ask grand\nquestions about life, instead it fills itself\nwith gentle musings about how we see\nthe world around us. It\u2019s cinematic people\nwatching, it\u2019s contemplative, but above\nall, it\u2019s enchanting.\n3. Toni Erdmann\nToni Erdmann is both an outlandish\ncomedy and heart-breaking tragedy.\nWhat\u2019s truly impressive is that these two\nelements form a duality; it doesn\u2019t switch\nfrom one to another, both comedy and\ntragedy coexist throughout. This harmony is used to explore deep, existential\nthoughts, ones that remain long after the\nfilm has finished.\n4. The Little Prince\nIn a world that promotes a fast ascent\ninto adulthood, full of its toils and pres-sures, The Little Prince reminds us that\nbecoming an adult doesn\u2019t have to mean\ngiving up your dreams and imagina-tion. A gorgeous animation mixed with\ndelicate stop motion, The Little Prince is a\ndelight both for the eyes and the soul.\n5. A Monster Calls\nMaking a great film that centres around\ndeath is always difficult, but by focusing\ninstead on how people deal with grief,\nA Monster Calls tells a story we can all\nlearn something from. Heavy, emotional\nscenes are balanced by animated stories\nthat use vibrant watercolours to create a\nvisually stunning film with an incredible\namount of depth.\n6. The Forbiden Room\nGuy Maddin\u2019s audacious new film spins\nGerman expressionism, Pythonesque comedy\nand a good dose of dream logic into a labyrinthine maze of eccentric short films, nested inside\none another like a giant Russian doll. It\u2019s an\nexhausting watch but it\u2019s endlessly inventive with\na cathartic finale revealing that it is a film born\nof a deep and ecstatic love for cinema itself.\n7. Son Of Saul\nFor the majority of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes\u2019 intense\ndebut feature, the camera is fixed on the\nface of Saul, a Jewish prisoner and member\nof the Sonderkommando at Auschwitz,\nforced to dispose of bodies from the gas\nchambers among other duties. His surroundings are slightly out of focus, but the\nhorrors of the camp aren\u2019t hidden. This\nis a powerful film, that takes a while to\nshake off but a much needed watch.\n8. Kubo and the Two Strings\nThe art of telling a simple story exceptionally\nwell has been lost in recent years, but Kubo is\nhere to prove that it can still be done. The hero\u2019s\nstory, complete with loveable sidekicks and\nhorrifying villains, is told using stop-motion animation on a larger scale than ever before and\nthe result is staggering beauty.\n9. A Bigger Splash\nWith Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes and more\non a gorgeous Italian island, Luca Guadagnino\ncouldn\u2019t go wrong with A Bigger Splash, a\nsexy, mysterious relationship study. The film\nlooks fantastic, whilst the performances are\nstudies in contrast: restraint and release;\nmenace and embrace; heat and frost.\nEventually tension builds and the temperature is pushed up and up until it has no\noption but to boil over.\n10. Anomalisa\nAnomalisa isn\u2019t an easy watch, but that\ndoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it. For ninety\nminutes, it lets you see life from the perspective\nof an exceedingly isolated man, one who sees\neveryone as the same, all speaking the same\nvoice. At the risk of being too alienating, it\ndoesn\u2019t let up; it perseveres through the pain to\nleave you with compassion for those too lost to\nask for help.\nYour favourite films of 2016\n\\\\ Onyx Films\n\\\\ Amazon Studios\n\\\\ Apaches Entertainment\n\\\\ Frenesy Film Company\n\\\\ Snoot Entertainment\nAlex Heib, Max Lewis-Clarke and Meryl Anil\n\n"

The tube\nis packed, the streets are clogged, shopping is a\nnightmare and you keep embarrassing yourself,\nblurting out family secrets at dinners, to people\nyou barely know.\nMeanwhile, there are all these fake gifts\neverywhere: stupid, empty, gift-wrapped boxes\ndesigned to lure you in and get your hopes up when\nyou know that all you really deserve is a big ol\u2019 lump\nof coal.\nEmpty gift wrapped boxes \u2013 isn\u2019t it great how\na seemingly harmless Christmas decoration can\nact so well as an analogy for the human condition,\nsending you tumbling into the abysmal depths of an\nexistential crisis? Beautiful and shiny on the outside,\nsturdy-looking, deceptively full of promise even, but\ndark, bare and empty on the inside. Ah the joys of the\nholidays.\nSpeaking of shattered illusions, as you might have\npicked up on if you read any of the national papers,\nImperial released a report that is the equivalent of\ntaking an axe and hacking into all your beautifully\ngift-wrapped Christmas gifts and spilling out all their\ncontents for everyone to see during a formal dinner\nat your parents house. During the American Psycho\ninspired mental breakdown, you hack into some great\ngifts, like that virtual reality headset you\u2019ve been\nwaiting all year for. You also hack into some expected\npresents such as socks, underwear and a pair of fuzzy\nbunny slippers. But then you also hack into all those\nempty gift-wrapped boxes, shattering the illusion of\nopulence and excess and embarrassing your family,\nthough everyone already knew that half the gifts\nunder the tree were just for show.\nThis is our last issue of term, and it\u2019s stupidly thick\nagain to keep you company over the winter break, or\nat the very least to keep you warm if you live in Evelyn\nGardens and your heating fails you again.\nInside this super-spesh edition, you will find the best\nand worst of 2016. You will laugh and you will cry but\npredominantly you\u2019ll probably just stare blankly at the\npages wondering what is wrong with the paper, your\nlife and the world in general.\nSo from everyone here at felix, happy holidays and\ndon\u2019t forget to take a break.

    "content": "felix C U L T U R E\n30 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 16 December 2016\nCrowning\nGlory | The\nCrown\nSaad Ahmed\nThe Crown takes a rare look at\nthe formative years of Queen\nElizabeth, and chronicles\nthe royal family\u2019s escapades\nthrough the 20th century.\nDoes it stack up well? Or is is\njust aimless royalty-porn?\nT\nhe Crown isn\u2019t\njust one of the\nmost anticipated\nshows of the year,\nbut if the rumors\nof its budget of\n\u00a3100 million an episode\nare true, it\u2019s also one of\nthe most expensive. This\nis Netflix\u2019s attempt at\ntrying out something more\ntraditional yet different (at\nleast by Netflix standards)\nat the same time, aiming to\nreach for a different kind of\ndemographic. After watching\nthe show, one conclusion\nyou immediately draw is that\nPeter Morgan\u2019s take on young\nQueen Elizabeth is a superb\ntriumph for Netflix.\nThe show revolves around\nQueen Elizabeth accepting\nher destiny and stepping\nup to lead the country. It\u2019s\ninteresting to see her stripping\nmore and more of her individuality for the sake of the\ncountry as time goes on. From\nsimply choosing a personal\nsecretary to responding to\nher sister\u2019s request to marry\nsomeone not approved by\nthe Church. It\u2019s an intriguing\nposition to be in and one\nthat\u2019s engaging to watch. At\none point, Churchill sums it up\nwith the quote \u201cNo one wants\nyou to be you. They want you\nto be it.\u201d\nWe see all the major players of the time, the different\nevents as they play out and\nhow everything flows and\nconnects together. The crown,\nin a compassionate piece of\nwork, gives a brilliant depiction of the Royal Family and\nhumanises them in a way that\nhas never been seen before.\nIt is a portrait of an extraordinary family, an intelligent\ncommentary on the effects of\nthe constitution on their personal lives, and a fascinating\naccount of postwar Britain all\nrolled into one.\nThe performances are all\nexcellent. Claire Foy is great\nas the young Elizabeth, giving\na portrayal of someone who\u2019s\nsoft-spoken but tough. Just by\nlooking at her face, you can\nsee that her pretty and playful smile hides the weight of\nthe world borne on her shoul-ders. Former Doctor Who\nstar Matt Smith also gives a\nstellar performance as Prince\nPhillip, a man of ambition\nand gnawing insecurity, traits\nwhich keep him from coming\nacross as a know-it-all. The\ntwo share a touching and\neasy chemistry that makes the\nlongevity of the union easy to\nunderstand, and renders the\ncouple not just sympathetic\nbut human.\nGoing through all the cast\nmembers would take too long\nbut suffice to say, everyone\nis giving it their all and gives\nlayered and nuanced per-formances. Jared Harris as\nKing George is a particular\nstandout, giving an even\nmore impressive performance\nthan Colin Firth did in the\nKing\u2019s Speech. He is a doting\nfather but a tough monarch,\nnot afraid to make the hard\ndecisions that needs to be\nmade.\nThe Crown is one of Netflix\u2019s most expensive shows for\na reason; the money is there\non the screen, as it needs to\nbe to truly capture the wealth\nand scope of the monarchy.\nYou can hear the ticks of the\ngrandfather clocks, and\neven the shift of\nweight in\nevery\npiece\nof\nfur-\\\\ The Crown is one\nof Netflix\u2019s most\nexpensive shows; the\nmoney is there on\nscreen \\\\\nRegality personified \\\\ Netflix\nniture as characters are\ngranted an audience with\ntheir queen. Everything\nlooks brilliant and is simply\nstunning, from very public\nmoments like the coronation\nto more private ones like\nPhilip taking flying lessons\nover the British countryside.\nMany people seem to want\nand crave for power. While\nthat may not necessarily\nbe a bad thing, this show\nultimately makes a strong\nand riveting argument for\nthe ways in which the cost\nof the throne isn\u2019t worth its\nbenefits. The Queen Mother\ntalks about how her husband\nwas really two different\npeople, before and after he\ntook the throne. And when\nit\u2019s Elizabeth\u2019s turn to take her\nfather\u2019s place, Queen Mary\nwrites her a letter warning of\na similar dichotomy between\nElizabeth Windsor and\nQueen Elizabeth.\nThe history of the Royal\nfamily in the 20th\ncentury is,\nof course, well documented\nbut Morgan keeps the story\ninteresting even in episodes\nwithout big historical events.\nThe coronation and Elizabeth\u2019s 1953 world tour make\nfor rich hours, but Morgan\nis as confident building an\nepisode around Elizabeth\nstudding a prize horse or\nthe Queen Mum\u2019s trip to\nScotland. The first season\nis definitely worth watching\nand incredibly binge worthy;\nthough of course, it only\nmakes the wait for\nseason two even\nlonger.\nDon\u2019t you hate it when you really like a hat but they\nonly have it one size too large? \\\\ Netflix\n\n"

From\nhere on hope, heartbreak,\nand Orthodox Judaism\npermeate this rom-com, the\nsecond feature from IsraeliAmerican director Rama\nBurshtein. It\u2019s a significant\ntonal departure from her\naward-winning debut (and\nGolden Lion-nominated)\nFill the Void, whose soulful,\nmeditative exploration of love\nand marriage contrasts with\nThrough the Wall\u2019s lighter-hearted approach. But this\ndifference belies its similar\nambitions to delve deep\ninto the complex nature of\nromance.\nThe film follows Michal\u2019s\npursuit of love, but its clearest\nfocus is on communication,\nand its necessity in forming\nstrong, stable relationships.\nFrom dates with a deaf man,\nto a suitor who\u2019ll only look\nher in the eye if Michal promises to marry him, Burshtein\nconstantly highlights the\ndistances that arise when we\nlack the ability to clearly and\ndirectly relate to each other.\nMoreover, she is interested\nin how we ourselves often\nbuild the greatest emotional\nbarriers, and Michal \u2013 a far\nfrom fault free protagonist \u2013\nallows Burstein to delve into\nthe psyche of the romantically\nadrift.\nThe casting is vital to the\nfilm\u2019s success in its exploration of these themes, and\nNoa Kooler\u2019s nuanced yet\ncommanding performance\nsucceeds in displaying the\nbalance of resolve and desperation the role requires. The\nemotional heft she provides\nis bolstered by the uniform\nstrength of the supporting cast, particularly Roni\nMerhavi as Feggie, Michal\u2019s\nbest friend, and Oz Zehavi\nas Yos, a fictional Israeli pop\nstar whose small budget has\nseemingly condemned him\nto a mere 12 groupies.\nThrough the Wall examines\nmany issues that permeate\nour lives \u2013 specifically the\nbarriers, self-inflicted or not,\nthat prevent us from finding\nlove. Despite the poignancy\nof these themes, the film\nmanages little emotional\nresonance. Part of this is\nattributable to the plot which,\na few minor twists aside, is\nfairly predictable from the\nstart. However much is also\ndown to the film\u2019s narrow\nfocus: Burshtein alludes to,\nand then abandons, several\nparallel experiences of love\nfrom supporting characters,\nand in doing so the potential\nfor a wider exploration of the\nnature of romance and where\nwe look for it is lost. Similarly,\nwhilst the infrequent comedic\nmoments are funny, they fail\nto touch any higher truths\nleaving the film unable to\nreach its lofty spiritual ambi-tions. Personally, all I took\naway was a desire to know\nwho my bride will be well\nbefore my wedding day.\nLooking for Love... \\\\ Venice Film Festival\nThrough the\nWall\nBy Lawrence Good\nSteve Bohnel\nI\nt\u2019s been a rough year to be an\nAmerican \u2013 the political system\nand U.S. election has divided our\ncountry in a way worse than I\nhave ever seen.\nThat\u2019s why of all of this year\u2019s\nfilms I watched this year, Sully was\nmy favorite.\nConsider the following fact the\nmovie illustrates: a pilot landed a jet\nplane, with both engines burnt out,\non the Hudson River, and everyone\nsurvived.\nDirector Clint Eastwood\u2019s depiction of the\n\u2018Miracle on the Hudson\u2019 is a moving piece\nthat demonstrates one of the most miraculous rescues of the 21st\ncentury. His ability\nLawrence Good\nT\nhis has been a good year for soulful films\nexploring the challenges faced in all walks\nof life. American Honey, from British director\nAndrea Arnold, brilliantly evokes the lives\nand struggles of itinerant American magazine\nsellers of all things. Arnold\u2019s greatest triumph\nis in showing how what begins as a promising escape\nfrom poverty morphs into an unrelenting trap, leaving\nits victims stuck in a rootless existence. The loss of home\nand livelihood is also examined, albeit very differently,\nin Ira Sach\u2019s Little Men. Juxtaposing the increasingly\nfraught relationship between an landlord and tenant with\nthe burgeoning friendship between their sons, the film\nexplores the harsh collision between youthful naivet\u00e9 and\nfinancial reality, showing the painfully human impacts\nof gentrification.\nNot all the year\u2019s films were so melancholic,\nand Hail, Caesar! was the Coen brother\u2019s wry\nand amusing take on Hollywood\u2019s golden age\nthrough the eyes of \u201cfixer\u201d Eddie Mannix.\nA hodgepodge of pastiche, the film lovingly\nmocks the pictures of the era. A film that uses,\nrather than celebrate, the fantasy of cinema,\nTale of Tales brings interwoven fairy tales to life\nwith a wonderful cast including the redoubtable\nToby Jones. Yet when all is said and done it\u2019s almost\nChristmas, and Wes Anderson\u2019s short Come Together\nis the most heart-warming thing you\u2019ll see these holidays,\nbesides the Muppet Christmas Carol.\n\\\\ Warner Bros\nto incorporate everyone, from first responders on the river to air traffic\ncontrol, shows the amount of work it required to ensure the lives of all\n155 lives on board were secured.\nTom Hanks is his usual self, with an impressive performance as Chelsea Sullenberger, the pilot who landed the aircraft. The rest of the cast\ndelivers solid performances during a 96-minute film that is well-paced.\nTrue to the events of January 15th\n, 2009, the film is mostly accurate,\nalthough tensions between the NTSB and Sullenberger were understandably drummed up for the big screen. That being said, this film is\na reason to escape and remember there is good in the world \u2013 given\nthis past year, that\u2019s a much-needed change of pace.\nAmerican Honey\nLittle Men\nHail, Caesar!\nTale of Tales\nCome Together\n\\\\ Sundance Selects\n1.

Weiner-Dog\nG\niven all the horror that\nhas been going on in\n2016, cinema can provide\nan escape from the real\nworld, a cathartic outlet\nfor all our emotions, or\na means of interrogating what we think\nabout the world. This year of film varied,\nfrom the dark settings of The Witch and\nSon of Saul, to the magnificent escapism\nof Youth and Paterson, to the beguiling\nstrangeness of Embrace of the Serpent\nand Evolution. Julieta marked a return\nto form for Almod\u00f3var, his best film\nsince Volver, while Charlie Kaufman\u2019s\nAnomalisa and Todd Solondz\u2019s WeinerDog asked us how much we are able to\nempathise with horrible protagonists.\nOur Little Sister, the 10th\nfilm from\nJapanese director Hirokazu Koreeda,\ntakes the top spot for its pure escapism:\ncentring around three sisters living in\nKamakura, who decide to take in their\nyounger half-sister following their father\u2019s\nfuneral, Our Little Sister follows the sisters throughout the course of a year.\nThe drama is, relatively, drama-free;\nthere are no critical denouements,\nno betrayals \u2013 instead all we have\nare a group of people, sharing\ntheir lives with each other, chat-ting, and eating. My god, the\neating. Our Little Sister reveals\nthe intimate links between food\nand love, between cooking and\nthe seasons, creating a feast for the\npalate and the senses.

Hail, Caesar!\nT\nhis year was, for better or\nworse, a big year for the movie\nindustry. It was the year that\nLeonardo DiCaprio won his\nOscar for The Revenant; his\ndreams will, finally, no longer\nbe haunted by shadowy golden figures\ndancing tauntingly close. Sadly, this was\novershadowed by the many losses of\nmany movie greats: legends like Gene\nWilder, Kenny Baker, Alan Rickman, and\nDavid Bowie (remember Labyrinth?) \u2013\nas well as newer faces such as Anton\nYelchin \u2013 will sadly never again grace\nour screens. They will be missed.\nThe films that were released over the\npast year had the usual mix of medioc-rity, a few diamonds, and some absolute\nstinkers. I\u2019m sorry, you will NEVER\nconvince me that Sausage Party is a\nphilosophical look at existential crises\n\u2013 it was awful. And don\u2019t even get me\nstarted on Trolls. So, as this year has\nbeen bad enough, we will focus on the\ngood. Here\u2019s the roundup of 10 of the\nbest films of 2016. There are a few warm,\ncuddly films to remedy this stinker of a\nyear such as Zootopia and Finding Dory.\nThere are a few true originals (this was\na very sequel-y/revival-y year) with the\nmost interesting being Arrival and the\nmost entertaining being La La Land. I\nwould recommend any of these films but\nplease think of the setting: don\u2019t watch\nDeadpool with your family, don\u2019t watch\nArrival in the dark, and don\u2019t watch Fantastic Beasts with muggles. You\u2019ve been\nwarned.\nI\nf there\u2019s one thing that can be said in\nfavour of 2016, probably one of the all-round worst years most people reading this\nhave lived through, it\u2019s that it didn\u2019t let us\ndown in the movie department. It took a\nwhile to get through the early-year slump\nleft in the wake of the UK releases of Oscar\ncontenders like The Hateful Eight and the\nhilarious, terrifying, gloriously madcap ride\nof The Big Short, and there were only a few\ngreat flicks that kept movie lovers sustained\nthroughout the year (a couple of these came\nin the form of heartfelt, spellbinding old-school\nsci-fi Midnight Special, and the perfectly-pitched buddy cop comedy The Nice Guys\nthat showcased Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling,\nand writer-director Shane Black all at their\nhigh-octane best).\nBut the tail-end of the year saw the releases\nof a slew of stone-cold gems and instant clas-sics; the abstract yet tear-jerking Nick Cave\ndocumentary One More Time With Feeling;\nthe heartbreaking and perfectly-acted Ken\nLoach welfare drama I, Daniel Blake; and\nbest of all, the breathtaking, beautifully\nepic yet desperately intimate American\nHoney. Picking between The Big Short and\nAmerican Honey for the year\u2019s best film\nwas extremely difficult as both are utterly\nessential for very different reasons: The\nBig Short grippingly tells an important\nstory about the recent stock market crash\nand warns how easy it would be for it to\nhappen again, but American Honey is a true\nmoviegoing experience. As three of the most\nabsorbing and refreshing hours I have ever\nspent in a cinema, it would be simply unfair\nnot to call it my top film of the year.\nTom Stephens\n1. American Honey\n2. The Big Short\n3. I, Daniel Blake\n4. The Nice Guys\n5. Midnight Special\n6. Nocturnal Animals\n7. One More Time With\nFeeling\n8. Creed\n9. Hail, Caesar!\n10.

Its main aim is\nunravelling the fundamental\nrole mathematicians have\nplayed in the development of\ncivilization.\nThe Winton offers a swoop-ing, long arching perspective\non mathematics, a view of\nthe field rather like the view\nyou might get from the 1929\nHandley Page biplane that\nhangs suspended from the\nceiling. The hard graft and\ndry technicalities have been\nglossed over \u2013 it\u2019s the vistas\nthat are on display here.\nFrom salesmen to sailors,\nfrom aircraft engineers to\nbankers, and from gamblers\nto garden designers, this gallery is a flight over 400 years\nof human ingenuity. Taking\noff in the Renaissance and\nlanding to the present day,\nover 100 incredible objects\nincluding intriguing hand-held\nmathematical instruments and\na 1929 experimental aircraft\nare presented and explained.\nTheir display is thematically\narranged around Trade/\nTravel, War/Peace, Maps/\nModels, Life/Death, Form/\nBeauty. The fil rouge that links\nall those objects is of course\nmaths, which is presented\nnot as an obscure activity\nundertaken by a niche of\nbad that the whole experience is slightly undermined\nby the very high glass display\ncases that block the hypnotic\nview of the central curvy\nstructure and by the noise\ncoming from the interactive\ndisplays in the Energy Gallery\nnearby.\nSome of the exhibits in the\nWinton are real hits: a Heath\nRobinson-looking Moniac\nmachine, William Froude's\nSwan and Raven hulls, Turner\nsketches, and PDP-8 minicomputer to name a few. Curated\nby David Rooney, the exhibits\ntell stories rather than dictate\nmathematical principles.\nTo attempt to humanise the\nabstract is a good choice:\nthe Winton brings a subject\nthought to be dry and boring\ndown from the ivory tower,\nto a place more accessible to\nthe masses.\nThe Winton Gallery is the\nfirst of Hadid\u2019s projects to\nopen in the UK since her\ndeath in March 2016. Zaha\nHadid and her team of architects have been exploring\nand connecting the fields of\nTheunbearablelightnessofmaths\nAgnese Abrusci\nresearchers working in back-rooms, but as an essential\ntool in understanding in our\neveryday life.\nMaths permeated Dame\nZaha Hadid's life; she was\na maths graduate before\nstudying architecture. Her\ndesign touchstone of the\nairflow around the aircraft\nwings sculpts the dynamics of\nthe gallery's central space.\nThe design was driven by the\nequations of airflow used in\nthe aviation industry, which\nis still an important area of\nmathematical research.\nWhen walking into the\nMaths gallery you immerse\nyourself into a serene pur-ple-lighted fluid space. All\nbecomes vector flow fields\nwhich create a contemplative aesthetic. The curved\noverhead structure and layout\nof the gallery represents the\nairflow around the Handley\nPage aircraft suspended\nat its centre. The hypnotic\nturbulence field leads your\nway to the different section of\nthe galleries where incredible\nobjects are on display. Too\nurbanism, architecture, and\ndesign since 1979. Working\nwith office partner Patrik\nSchumacher for almost three\ndecades, Hadid's vision redefined the architecture of the\n21st\ncentury. She dedicated\nherself to worldwide projects\nthat combined the unwavering belief in the power of\ninvention with the connectivity\nand fluidity of the surrounding space. From the Olympic\nAquatics Centre to the cafeteria of the Serpentine Gallery,\nfrom Beijing to Baku, Zaha\nHadid's unique buildings\nare everywhere. Now there\nis one of her creations just\naround the corner \u2013 so go\nand explore!\n\\\\ From salesmen\nto sailors, from aircraft engineers to\nbankers, and from\ngamblers to garden\ndesigners, this gallery is a flight over\n400 years of human\ningenuity \\\\\nInstallation by Zaha Hadid Architects (detail) \\\\ Agnese Abrusci\nP\nicture a piece\nof contemporary\narchitecture. You\u2019re\nprobably thinking\nof the work of Frank\nGehry \u2013 his works\nare considered by many in\nthe world of architecture to\nbe defining buildings of the\n20th\nand 21st\ncentury. Gehry\nbuildings, the Guggenheim in\nBilbao being one, are fiercely\nmodernist; great structures\nof steel and chrome tacked\ntogether that rise defiantly\nfrom the ground. His is a\nstyle that is common amongst\nhis male contemporaries.\nThese are loud buildings. By\ncontrast Dame Zaha Hadid\u2019s\nwork is subtle, quieter \u2013\nthe buildings blossom, the\ncomponents flow into each\nother. Gehry\u2019s work is often\na mere facade \u2013 once inside\nthere is often not much of\ninterest. Hadid\u2019s creations\nhave an understated drama\nthat only grows once you\u2019re\ninside. Light predominates\nin the interiors of Hadid\u2019s\ndesigns, both from halogen\nlights and natural light\nintroduced in unexpected\nways \u2013 an almost womb-like\nexperience is created, quite\nunlike being inside any other\nmodernist building.\nHadid, who was born in\nBaghdad in 1950, studied\nmathematics at the American\nUniversity of Beirut, and then\nwent to study architecture at\nthe Architectural Association\nSchool in London. Her heritage alone marks her out as\nexceptional amongst her con-temporaries: google \u2018famous\narchitects\u2019, and Hadid is the\nonly non-male, non-white\nface that will come up. Her\nbirthplace was, however, the\nleast remarkable fact about\nher; her personality was just\nas larger-than-life as her\nbuildings. There are countless\nanecdotes about her that\npaint a picture of her as a\nreal life Miranda Priestley, the\nterrifying head of a fashion\nmagazine in The Devil Wears\nPrada \u2013 during her studies,\nwhen asked for a design at\na briefing, Hadid threw her\nscarf on the table with a\nflourish and said \u201chere\u2019s your\ndesign\u201d and stalked out; in\nanother instance, during the\nVenice Biennale, when she\nrealised she had forgotten\nto pack her favourite pair of\nheels, she sent her assistant to\nher flat in London to retrieve\nthem in time for a party the\nsame night.\nFrom the outrageous stories\nit might be easy to brush\nher off as merely a drama\nqueen, more concerned\nwith theatrics than with the\nhard graft of architecture.\nHer professional accolades\ndiscredit this \u2013 she is the only\nwoman to have won the Royal\nInstitute of British Architects\u2019\nGold Medal in her own right.\nTechnical skills gathered\nfrom her mathematics degree\nunderpin her designs \u2013 she\nreferenced fluid dynamics,\nwas inspired by the organic\ncurves present in nature:\nshells and waves, lilies. As her\ncareer progressed her designs\nmatured in ambition; other\narchitects may have balked at\nher impossible designs but her\nbackground in mathematics\nmade sure that she understood how materials would\nmeld together to create a\ncohesive whole.\nHer buildings with their\nundulating curves can be\nseen all over the world. She\ndesigned the Aquatics Centre\nfor the Olympic Games in\n2012. Wave-like (it also looks\na bit like a tongue too), it\u2019s\na concrete structure that\nis impossibly streamlined,\nimpossibly light looking \u2013\nothers may have taken the\nindustrial, solid material\nand created something that\nhunkers down into the earth,\nstolid in its solidness; instead\nHadid\u2019s design seems to be\non the verge of taking flight.\nAnother of her designs,\nthe ROCA Gallery in West\nBrompton is pleasingly sci-fi:\nwhite interiors are peppered\nwith curved, sculpted pillars\nthat seems like the inside of\nan alien spaceship. Some\nbuildings that attempt to be\nfuturistic quickly seem to\nbecome dated. The ROCA\nGallery, built more than 5\nyears ago, still feels aspi-rational, filled with smooth\nconcrete and white chrome.\nHadid unexpectedly passed\naway earlier this year after a\nsudden heart attack in hospital following an admission for\nbronchitis. Her death is a loss\nto the world of architecture\nwhich finds itself without her\noriginal voice. The first of her\ndesigns to be unveiled after\nher death is the ceiling of the\nWinton Gallery in the Science\nMuseum. The curves swoop in\nand out like petals of a flower\nunfurling \u2013 it\u2019s lit up with\npink and purple lights. The\ntechnicolour aspect is unusual\nfor Hadid who normally\nbathes her interiors in natural\nlight or monochrome. Her\nsketches are on display at\nthe Serpentine Gallery, and\nthe ROCA Gallery and the\nAquatic Centre are available\nto visit. Within the next few\nyears, her design for the\nAl Wakrah Stadium for the\nQatar 2022 World Cup will\nbe realised \u2013 this is a building\nthat has been dogged with\ncontroversy. By June 2015\nupwards of 1200 workers had\ndied in Qatar due to poor\nworking conditions, the death\ntoll is predicted to rise into\nover 7000 by the time the\npreparations are completed.\nHadid distanced herself from\nthe deaths saying that she\nhad only been involved in the\ndesign process, and had no\npower to change the situa-tion, saying \"I have nothing to\ndo with the workers...I think\nthat's an issue the government \u2013 if there's a problem\n\u2013 should pick up. Hopefully,\nthese things will be resolved.\"\nHadid carved out a niche\nfor herself at the top of the\nworld of architecture. She\nrefused to be influenced, or\ncowed by her contemporaries\nand thus blazed a path for\nwomen in the field which even\nnow is dominated largely by\nold white men. Her buildings\nremain as her legacy \u2013 one\nof uncompromising originality\nand fierce individuality.\nArtistinfocus|ZahaHadid,1950\u20132016\nZaha Hadid left behind a monumental legacy \\\\ Simone Cecchetti\nFreya Hepworth-Lloyd &\nIndira Mallik\n\n"

Kova\nPatisserie, a new addition to\nthe Soho food scene, stocks\ntheir handmade mille cr\u00eape\ncakes in their glass shelves\nin green tea, chocolate\nand fruit, selling out by 3\nN\number 1.\nGreen Tea.\nYou know\nthat green\ntea has finally\ntaken over the\nland of boring English Breakfast when even Starbucks has\nadded a green tea latte to\ntheir permanent menu. Green\ntea has always been a popular drink in Asia for its many\nhealth benefits. Not only is it\nyour best coffee alternative,\nit\u2019s herby, earthy and bittersweet notes have deemed to\nbe a great addition to any\ndessert, from cakes to ice\ncream to even KitKats, attracting an unimaginable craze to\nany green tea flavoured food\nproduct.\nWhile many Londoners are\nstill scratching their heads and\ntrying to adjust their palette\nto the odd, green-coloured,\ngrassy-flavoured ice cream,\nmany green tea-themed cafes\nhave opened their doors to\nwelcome the curious and\nthe homesick (that is, sad,\ngreen tea-deprived overseas\nstudents like myself). Visit\nTsujiri, a Japanese tea house\nthat has recently expanded\nto London, for a taste of\nauthentic matcha in the form\nof ice cream and many other\ntraditional desserts.

Street food.\nThe street food trend has\nstayed strong throughout the\npast few years and is growing\neven stronger, with more and\nmore people embracing the\ncreative, multi-cultural and\naffordable menus of these\nindependent stalls at many\nmarket locations across\nLondon. A visit to a food\nmarket, munching on burgers\nand letting the juices drip all\nover, has become an enjoyable pastime on the weekend.\nMaltby Street and Druid\nStreet Markets near London\nBridge has risen to fame,\npacked with visitors during\nthe weekends for oysters,\nwaffles and local produce.\nNew additions to the street\nfood market scene this year\ninclude KERB Camden, a\nsmall collection of stalls open\n7-days a week featuring Oli\nBaba\u2019s scrummy halloumi\nfries, and Flat Iron Square,\nan exciting hub of indie street\nfood kitchens open daily,\nplus a flea market during the\nweekend.\nNumber 3. Dominique Ansel\nThe creator of The Cronut\u00ae\ndeserves his own category.\nThe patisserie has finally put\nLondon into his pocket in\nSeptember after opening successful bakeries in New York\nand Tokyo, bringing major\nqueues outside his bright\nyellow awning every morning\nfor a flake of his Cronut\u00ae.\nThe Cronut\u00ae has a different\nflavour every month, complimented by Ansel\u2019s many other\nequally delicious pastries\nand desserts. If the crois-sant-doughnut hybrid is not\nreached the grey, miserable,\nrocky British beaches all the\nway from sun-kissed, tropical\nshores of Hawaii. The col-ourful, healthy summer bowl\nof marinated raw fish cubes\non rice has decided to stay\nthrough to the sub-zero days\nof December, with a growing number of restaurants\ntransforming the recipe by\nexchanging rice with purple\nrice, quinoa, and even kale.\nOur wonderful neighbour\nTombo has opened their own\nPok\u00e9-dedicated bar in Soho,\nserving bowls with a more\nJapanese taste. Ahi Pok\u00e9 near\nTottenham Court Road has\na fully customizable menu\ngiving you full freedom from\nyour base, the fish, and all the\nway through to the sauce. The\nnewly opened Island Pok\u00e9\nin Carnaby also serves the\nbest acai bowls in London on\ntop of their Pok\u00e9 menu. Carb\nloading the Pok\u00e9 way.\nNumber 5. Mille Cr\u00eape.\nImagine 20 layers of paper-thin cr\u00eapes stacked on top\none another with layers of\ncream between them. That,\nmy friends, is a mille cr\u00eape\ncake.\nFirst brought into the global\nChristy Lam\nenough to satisfy your sugar\ncravings, go for a Frozen\nS\u2019more (toasted marshmallow\nwith vanilla custard ice cream\non a stick), a DKA (which\nstands for Dominique\u2019s Kouign\nAmann), or a chocolate chip\ncookie shot at 3 pm on the\ndot.\nNumber 4. Poke the Pok\u00e9\nThe pok\u00e9 waves have finally\npm every day. Sosharu, an\nupscale Japanese restaurant\nin Farringdon, features their\ngreen tea mille cr\u00eape cake on\ntheir dessert menu. Nojo in\nOld Street tube station, serves\ntheir gluten-free green tea\nversion alongside their other\nhealthy, gluten-free cr\u00eapes\nand treats. The mille cr\u00eape\ncake is still taking its baby\nsteps in the UK, with great\npotential to grow in the year\nahead.\n\\\\ Munching on\nburgers and letting\nthe juices drip all\nover has become an\nenjoyable pastime \\\\\n\\\\ Imagine 20 layers\nof paper-thin cr\u00eapes\nstacked on top one\nanother with layers\nof cream between\nthem \\\\\n1\n3\n2\n4\n5\nOne of the most notable food writers\nand critics of the 21st century, AA\nGill passed away last week following\na battle with cancer. Here are some\nthoughts from a fan.\nIndira Mallik\n\\\\ He wore only\nSavile Row suits\nlined with Hermes\nscarves \\\\\nAA Gill is away\nT\nhe journalist AA\nGill, The Sunday\nTimes food (and\noccasionally TV)\ncritic, died last\nweek, only three\nweeks after writing about his\ncancer diagnosis in his weekly\ncolumn.\nHe broke the news with the\nkind sumptuousness of words\nhe used in his criticisms; writing \u201cthere is barely a morsel\nof offal that is not included.\nI have a trucker\u2019s gut-buster,\ngimpy, malevolent, meaty\nmalignancy.\u201d These were\nthe kinds of turns of phrase\nthat distinguished him from\nall other writers \u2013 he had\nan almost archaic way of\nto copy takers. Keeping\nthe typists at the end of the\nline, as well as the readers\npicking up the writing in print\nentertained must then have\nbeen the challenge. It was a\nchallenge to which he took\nto with gusto. One got the\ndistinct impression that he\nrelished eviscerating those\nwho did not meet his exacting standards, or when he\nwanted to court controversy.\nHe was regularly regarded as\nwriting, as if his descriptions\nhad run away from him whilst\nhe was speaking. It was a\ntype of writing that was so\nparticular to him, perhaps\nprecisely because he did not\nwrite like most journalists do.\nProfoundly dyslexic, words,\nto which he had dedicated\nhis whole working life, did\nnot come naturally to him,\nso he dictated his columns,\nhis essays, and his novels\na snob (he wore only Savile\nRow suits lined with Hermes\nscarves), and frequently a\nmisogynist \u2013 he once referred\nto Clare Balding as a \u2018dyke\non a bike\u2019, and historian\nMary Beard as too ugly to be\non television, his own partner\nof more than twenty years,\nNicola Formby, often starred\nin his columns referred only\nby the moniker \u2018the Blonde\u2019.\nFor all his failings and his\nsnobbery he could sometimes\nreveal the full enormity of\nhis generosity of spirit \u2013 in\nFebruary he wrote a deeply\nmoving review of the canteens that had sprung up in\nthe Jungle refugee camp in\nwhich he likened the act of\nthe refugees setting up camp\nby a river and gathering to\neat at the beginnings of every\ncivilization. In announcing\nGill\u2019s death, Tim Shipman,\npolitical editor of the Sunday\nTimes, wrote: \u201cAA Gill, the\nwriter who first made me buy\nthe Sunday Times, the best\nof us for 30 years, has died.\nVery sombre mood in the\noffice.\u201d AA Gill wasn\u2019t the\nreason I bought The Sunday\nTimes, but his columns were\nthe first pieces I turned to in\nthe paper, always feeling a\ntwinge of disappointment\nwhen the line \u2018AA Gill is\naway\u2019 appeared in fine print\nat the bottom of his regular\nfood column Table Talk . No\none else wrote quite like AA\nGill, and it is hard to imagine\nthat anyone ever will.\nEU Xmas\nOr, around the glorious federation\nin a delicious meal. Follow felix on\na tour of some traditional christmas\ndelicacies from countries across\nEurope. Bonus points if you\u2019re sober\nat the end.\nI\nt\u2019s time to get ready for\nthe Christmas dinner \u2013 if\nyou already had it, well,\nit\u2019s never too late to have\na second or third one.\nI mean, it\u2019s Christmas \u2013\nyou can celebrate it as many\ntimes as you want. And now\nthat you are a student, time\nto try something different.\nI\u2019m not saying that the food\nAndrada Balmez\nyour mom has made in the\npast (well, your whole life,\nactually) is not good, just\nthat you deserve a change \u2013\nand go international! Or, if\nyou come from one of those\ncountries/families that don\u2019t\nmake such a big fuss about\nChristmas, celebrate it with\nstyle for the first time.\nStart your Christmas dinner\nFrench \u2013 l\u2019aperitif must be\nFrench. Have some foie gras\non slices of bread and some\nsmoked salmon \u2013 the pretentious kind, served in small\nbites. Of course, have wine\nand cheese from France too.\nContinue it with some Romanian traditional \u201csarmale\u201d\n\u2013 really just some cabbage\nleaves stuffed with a minced\npork and beef mixture\n\u2013 served with warm \u201cmamaliga\u201d \u2013 polenta cooked in a\nreally delicious way: boiled in\nwater until it\u2019s thick and then\nbaked a bit in the oven \u2013 with\nsome cream.\nTime to have German\ndrinks, too. I don\u2019t have to\nspell it out for you: beer. Or, if\nyou feel brave enough, go all\nRussian, but don\u2019t mix them,\nand try to enjoy an almost\nsober Christmas party. Try\nsome Czech salad: potatoes\nwith mayonnaise, hard-boiled\neggs and boiled veggies. You\ncan eat it as a main dish, too.\nMake your Christmas\ntable look gorgeous with\nthe Austrian traditional pig\nhead \u2013 it tastes even better\nthan it looks and if you want\nsome delicacy \u2013 pig cheeks.\nOr, if you fancy some poultry,\nyou can return to France with\ntheir amazing dinde aux\nmarrons \u2013 another fancy way\nof cooking turkey, but, hey,\nit\u2019s Christmas so you must go\nfancy! And complement it\nwith something you cannot\npronounce yourself: R\u00f8dk\u00e5l\n(red cabbage).\nTime for the best part \u2013\ndessert! I recommend Italian,\npanettone with zabaglione\ncream. I know you understand me, and it\u2019s not a bad\ndecision to invest in a good\none. Don\u2019t forget the \u201cBritish\u201d\npart \u2013 you must celebrate the\ncountry you currently live in\n\u2013 with a gingerbread house.\nYou will get extra points if you\nactually bake and assemble it\nyourself, but you can totally\nrock the table with a good\nlooking bought one. Really,\nany dessert will do, but make\nsure that it either has a lot of\nchocolate or it\u2019s damn good.\nEnd in style with some hot\nchocolate and stroopwafflen\n\u2013 compliments to the Dutch.\nP.S. you can, if you want,\ngo all Japanese and have\nKFC. No, I\u2019m not crazy \u2013 they\nreally do go wild for fried\nchicken at Christmas!\n\\\\ I\u2019m not saying\nthat the food your\nmom has made in\nthe past (well, your\nwhole life, actually)\nis not good, just\nthat you deserve a\nchange \\\\\nCredit: Peter Marlow\n\n"

This is the first\never direct evidence of the\nexistence of black holes. Nine\nother achievements are highly\ncommended, groundbreaking\ndiscoveries from nuclear\nphysics to materials science:\n1. A new illustration of the\nSchrodinger\u2019s cat paradox (Chen Wang, Robert\nSchoelkopf and colleagues\nat Yale University and INRIA\nParis-Rocquencourt). They\nmanaged to exemplify\nquantum superposition by\nrepresenting the cats by a\nlarge ensemble of photons\nand the two boxes by microwave cavities.\n2. New Gravimeter (Uni-versity of Glasgow scientists)\nwhich can make very precise\nmeasurements of the Earth\u2019s\ngravity with potential applications in mineral exploration,\nvolcano monitoring, and civil\nengineering.\n3. Nearest Neighbour (Pale\nRed Dot collaboration), a\nrocky exoplanet within the\nhabitable zone of Proxima\nCentauri and the nearest\nstar of the Solar system. It is\nabout 1.3 times the size of the\nEarth and could theoretically\nsustain liquid water on its\nsurface.\n4. Quantum Entanglement\n(Chris Balance at Universty\nof Oxford and Ting Rei Tan\nat University of Colorado\nat Boulder), a phenomenon\nbetween two different types\nof ions that could make\nnew microscope lens offering\na revolutionary combination\nof large field of view and high\nresolution.\n8. Fundamental particle\ninteraction simulations (Rainer\nBlatt and Peter Zoller of the\nInstitute for Quantum Optics\nand Information at the University of Innsbruck) on quantum\ncomputers, a significant\nquantum computers a reality.\n5. Nuclear Clock (Lars von\nder Wense, Peter Thirolf at\nLudwig Maximilian University\nof Munich, Helmholtz Institute\nMainz, and the Johannes\nGutenberg University Mainz),\nwhich could be developed\nfrom the transition discovered\nin the element thorium-229.\nSuch a clock would be considerably more stable than\ncurrent atomic clocks.\n6. Negative refraction (Cory\nDean, Avik Ghosh at Columbia University, University of\nVirginia, Cornell University,\nthe Japanese National Institute for Materials Science,\nand Shenyang National Laboratory for Materials science),\na property discovered in\ngraphene. This could lead to\nthe creation of revolutionary\npowerful lenses.\n7. Mesolens (Gail McConnell, Brad Amos at the\nUniversity of Strathclyde), a\nMaking waves in physics | 2016\nS\ntrolling through\nthe markets of the\ncity Myitkyina in\nMyanmar, Lida\nXing, a scientist\nwith China\nUniversity of Geosciences,\nBeijing, came across a\nblock of amber that had\npreserved within it a fossil of\na dinosaur\u2019s tail from nearly\n99 million years ago.\nA collaborative study by\npalaeontologists from Royal\nSaskatchewan Museum,\nCanada, China University of\nGeosciences, Beijing, and\nUniversity of Bristol, UK has\nprovided new insights on the\nevolution of feather structure.\nThe work has recently been\npublished in the journal Current Biology.\nThe fossil is that of a\ndinosaur belonging to a carnivorous group, the theropods,\nwhich probably lived sometime during the mid-cretaceous\nperiod. Observations suggest\nthe tail colour to be brown on\nthe top and paler in colour on\nthe underside, lined by feathers all along its length. Unlike\nin present day birds or their\nancestors, the vertebrae of this\nfossilised tail are not fused\ntogether, but are instead long\nand very flexible with the keel,\nthe area where the flight muscles are attached: a typical\ncharacteristic of flying dino-saurs. The feathers found on\nthis fossil differ from the ones\nthat we see on birds today.\nThe feathers of birds like\nthose of the pigeons that we\noften spot strutting down the\npavements typically consist of\na long shaft called the rachis.\nAttached to the rachis are\nrows of fine filaments called\nbarbs which are intertwined\nwith one another by barbules,\nforming a tightly woven\nsurface. The fossil specimen\nexhibits a well developed\nbranching system of barbs\nand barbules, however, it has\na poorly developed rachis.\nThis clearly indicates the\nbarbs and barbules to have\nevolved much before the\nrachis.\nWell preserved fossils are\na rare find. They provide a\nsnapshot of how life existed\nduring the pre-historic times.\nAmber or fossilised resin is\none of the best mediums for\nfossil preservation. So well\npreserved is this specimen,\nthat the scientists were able\nto retrieve the soft tissues and\neven haemoglobin from the\nblood.\nHigh-quality fossils such as\nthese help palaeontologists\nto piece together the tale\nof how our modern day\nbirds evolved from the flying\ncold-blooded reptiles of the\npre-historic times. The scientists of this study believe that\nunlike some species of reptiles\nfound today, this particular\ndinosaur couldn\u2019t shed its tail\nbut succumbed to an untimely\ndeath after getting it caught\nin the glue-like resin.\nA tale within a tail\nIpsita Herlekar reveals the secrets of a well preserved dinosaur fossil\ndevelopment in the field.\n9. Single-atom engine\n(Kilian Singer, Johannes\nRo\u00dfnagel at University of\nMainz), a heat engine based\non just one atom, able to\nconvert a difference in temperature to mechanical work\nusing a single calcium ion.\nWhen black holes collide \\\\ NASA Blueshift\n\n"

Essentially, most of the government\nwere corrupt whilst the rest of\nBrazil was undergoing a fairly\nbig recession. The people weren\u2019t happy with this (duh) and\nthe President was subsequently\nimpeached. Oh, and they had\na pretty big outbreak of the\naforementioned Zika virus, but\nalthough it was bad, it didn\u2019t\nstart the pandemic that some\npeople predicted. Some Russian athletes couldn\u2019t compete\nin the games due to doping, the\npool turned green, and the sailing waters were pretty dodgy,\npollution-wise. But, we came\nout of it 2nd\nin the medal table\nso who cares? Arguably in the\ntop five highlights of the year\nwas the start of the Night Tube\non three London lines (two\nmore have since followed), fantastic news for that post-ACC\ncommute.\nStars of the big screen, Gene\nWilder (Willy Wonka) and\nKenny Baker (R2-D2) were\nthe unfortunate casualties of\nAugust and by now the afterlife was looking more and more\nlike the guest list of a swish\nElton John party.\nTurkey had a failed military coup in which hundreds\nwere killed and over 15,000\nsupporters of the coup were\narrested and detained. President Er\u011fodan was out of the\ncountry when the uprising from\nmembers of the army happened and had to Facetime a\nnews network in order to make\na plea to citizens to back his\nleadership. France was yet\nagain the scene of a terrible\natrocity, this time in Nice. 86\npeople were killed and hundreds more injured as a truck\nwas driven through crowds\ncelebrating Bastille Day. ISIS\nclaimed responsibility for the\nattack.\nBrexit fallout carried on too,\nwith the pound and the FTSE\nrising and falling due to even\nthe faintest of whispers on\nwhat on earth the UK planned\nto do if/when Article 50 was\ninvoked.

This is\nperhaps contrary to what you\nmay believe if you have been\nreading this column for the\npast few weeks.\nSome may have the\ningrained belief that magic\nmushrooms and LSD release\nuncontrolled demons from\nwithin, viciously addicting\nusers in minutes. If this is\nyou, then the idea that these\nbanned substances could cure\ndisorders of the brain should\nbe fascinating.\nProfessor David Nutt and\nDr Robin Carhart-Harris at\nImperial College London\n(woooooo!) believe it is time\nto end the stigma surrounding the therapeutic use of\nIf you\u2019re struggling with drug\nuse, visit talktofrank.com\npsychedelic drugs. They\nbelieve ending the prejudice\ncould prove beneficial to\nmillions of people, especially\nthose who have failed to\nrespond to conventional\ntreatment.\nIn the 50s and 60s it was\nalmost impossible to open a\npsychiatric journal without\ncoming across some form of\nresearch into the effects of\nLSD. At the time, LSD was the\nnewest wonder substance,\nwith the potential to treat any\nmental ailment thrown at it.\nHowever, by the late 60s, the\npolitical will of worldwide\ngovernments (particularly\nthe United States) stepped\nup their anti-psychedelic\nstance. With LSD increasingly\nlinked to the anti-Vietnam\nwar protests and counter-cul-tural revolution, it received\nan almost universal ban in\nWestern countries. With the\nban came an unprecedented\nlull in research, with some\nexperts claiming the study of\npsychedelic drugs in medicine\nto have been set back by over\n50 years.\nToday, governments are\nstill not open to the idea of\nincreasing the availability\nof psychoactive substances,\neven for research. Famously,\nProfessor David Nutt was\nsacked as chair of the UK\ngovernment\u2019s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs\nin 2009 by the then Labour\nadministration of Gordon\nBrown. To be clear, he was\ndismissed for claiming that\nhorse-riding was more dangerous than ecstasy. Professor\nNutt wrote that horse-riding\ncaused ten deaths and more\nthan 100 road accidents each\nyear. Additionally, through\nhunting, horse-riding also\nled to \u201cgatherings of users\nthat often are associated\nwith these groups engaging\nin violent conduct\u201d. He also\ndescribed other risky activities such as \u201cbase jumping,\nclimbing, bungee jumping,\nhang-gliding, motorcycling\u201d\nwhich were much worse\nthan \u201cmany illicit drugs\u201d. The\nbecause they are called\n\u2018drugs\u2019. Other parts of life frequently carry similar danger\nyet people appear unaware.\nIn order to use a substance\nsuch as LSD in research,\nUK researches require a\n\u00a33,000 license from the\nHome Office, in addition to\nwhat I have heard described\nas \u201cyears of paperwork\u201d.\nFurthermore they must source\na legal supply of the drug\nin question. This is compli-cated; you can imagine the\ndifficulty in trying to legally\nsource an illegal drug. It is\nalmost as if the government\nis actively trying to suppress\nresearch. LSD is classified as\nsomething called a \u2018Schedule\n1\u2019 substance, which means\nthe drug is extremely hard\n\\\\ They must source\na legal supply of\nthe drug. This is\ncomplicated; you\ncan imagine the\ndifficulty in trying\nto legally source an\nillegal drug \\\\\n\\\\ Ending\nthe prejudice\nsurrounding\npsychedelic drugs\ncould prove\nbeneificial to millions\nof people, especially\nthose who have\nfailed to respond\nto conventional\ntreatment \\\\\nChristopher Haigh\npoint of these quotes was to\ncompare the risks between\nhorse-riding and ecstasy. It\nwas necessary to create a\ndebate about drug abuse\nand risk taking. Often people\nunfairly assign risk to drugs\nwill be no medicinal use. Until\nthis classification is reformed\nit appears that psychoactive\nsubstances such as LSD will\nnever be able to achieve the\ngreat potential which was\nforeseen for them in the 50s\nand 60s.\nPsychedelic drugs may yet\nhold the key to untapped\nmedical potential that we are\nunable to reach with conventional treatments. However,\nwith the current stance of\ngovernments worldwide, we\nare unable to acquire these\nsubstances, let alone research\nthem. Hopefully, with increasing demand from academics,\nwe will able to undertake\nresearch into what could be\nground-breaking and life-sav-ing medicinal care.\nto get hold of. Schedule 1\nalso means that the drug is\nbelieved to have no medicinal use. How is research\nsupposed to be conducted\nwithin this ridiculous system?\nIf we are unable to perform\nresearch then of course there\n\n"

To be honest, this section\ncould easily just be \u2018The News\u2019. But, the shitiness of reality does not\nexcuse the shitiness of art. So, let\u2019s examine some of the attrocities\ncommited in the name of \u2018entertainment\u2019 on the small screen this year.\nThe Worst of TV\nMacGyver |\nCBS\nBecause apparently some\npeople still haven\u2019t been\ncompletely burned by the idea\nof rebooting 80s franchises,\nhere comes MacGyver. A\ncompletely half-assed, badly\nacted cash grab, this series\nbarely feigns an attempt at\nemulating its ideal. There\u2019s no\nsuspense, and the pacing is\nbizzare. It all just makes you\nask, \u2018who wanted this, who is\nit for?\u2019\nOk, I promise you, the\npurpose of this article isn\u2019t just\nto shit on things from the 80s.\nReally, though, the failure of\nthis sitcom revival should be a\nsurprise to no one. Televison\nas a medium has evolved so\nmuch since those days that\neven the most innocuous\nsitcoms today have more\ndepth, substance, and edge\nthan Full House. Attempting\nto bring those elements into\nFuller House just leads to\nculture clash, but leaving\nthem out makes it dated. It\u2019s\nlose-lose; this was a bad idea.\nOh Gary Sinise. Lieutenant Dan\nshould keep looking for legs\nelsewhere, because this show\ncertainly doesn\u2019t have any.\nSpinning out of the mediocre at\nbest Criminal Minds, this show\nflaunts the bizzare premise of\nsome sort of global police team\nthat saves Americans from those\nbad foreigners who just want to\nvictimize them.\nThe one thing the show does\nhave going for it, however, is that\nit\u2019s probably the most critically\npanned show of the year.\nAppropriately for the subject\nmatter, the network title is\ndownright prophetic. It\u2019s\nwhat you\u2019ll be needing after\nwatching this. Credit where\ncredit is due, rather than\nattempting to reboot The Omen\nmovie franchise, this series acts\nas some sort of continuation;\nwith an adult Damien coming\nto grips with his role as the anti-christ. However, the cliched\nchoice of aesthetics, coupled\nwith the laughable dialogue\nand direction mean this show\nis DOA.\nProbably the least offensive entry on this list, Lucifer isn\u2019t that\nbad really. However, it\u2019s a perfect example of the tragedy\nof \u2018what could have been\u2019. A largely uninspired, if decent\ncop show, Lucifer is based on the seminal DC comic of the\nsame name. We could have had a grand cosmic saga about\ngods and angels, instead, we got CSI: Hell. And believe me,\nthat\u2019s not nearly as interesting as it sounds.\nFuller House |\nNetflix\nCriminal Minds:\nBeyond Borders |\nCBS\nDamien | A&E\nLucifer | Fox\n4\n1 3\n5\n2\n\\\\CBS\n\\\\Netflix\n\\\\ CBS\n\\\\ Fox\n\\\\A&E\nBut, let\u2019s avoid ending on a sour note. Despite everything, 2016 has\nbeen a remarkably good year for television. In fact, so much so that\nnarrowing this down to just five was quite the challenge. So, in case\nyou missed them, here are the highest highs of the year\u2019s offerings.\nThe Best of TV\n4\nThe typically sharp and\npiercing animated Netflix show\ncontinues to enthrall. This year,\nwe watched Bojack struggling\nto deal with a resurgence in his\nfame, as all his friends gradually\ndrift away.\nThis season graced us with\nan absolutely beautiful silent\nunderwater episode; scored\nonly with ethereal pop music.\nEqually,it unflinchingly delivered\nperhaps the show\u2019s most\nemotionally draining punches in\nits penultimate episode.\nBojack Horseman |\nNetflix 1\nIt really has been all-change\nfor Donald Golver this year;\nwhether it\u2019s re-inventing his\nrapper persona Childish\nGambino into a bonafide\nfunk god, or moving away\nfrom straight comedy to\ndrama.\nAtlanta puts a lens on an\nAmerican sub-culture that\u2019s\nonly really ever explored\nin stereotypes on TV. What\nresults is a heartfelt, and\nfascinating series that\ncomfortably flits between\ndrama anbd comedy.\nAtlanta |\nFX\n2\nWestworld |\nHBO\nWith Game of Thrones coming\nto a conclusion soon, HBO\nwisely realised that it needed\na new cash-cow behemoth to\nkeep the money ticking over.\nEnter, Westworld. A slick,\nexcelllently performed sci-fi\ndrama with high production\nvalues, this show looks to be\ndoing for sci-fi what Game of\nThrones did for fantasy. And\nto think, it\u2019s all derived from\na semi-obscure Yule Brenner\nmovie. Westworld\u2019s first\nseason has kept us hooked.\nHere\u2019s to many more.\n3\nWhenJohnStewartretiredlast\nyear, the collective western\nliberal community let out a\nmournful wail. Thankfully,\nhowever, he had not left us\nwithout contingencies. A host\nof successor shows popped\nup to fill the void, including\nthe retooled Daily Show.\nHowever, none of them quite\nmanaged to match up to the\nferrocity and wit of Stewart\u2019s\noriginal. That is, of course.\nuntil Daily Show veteran Sam\nBee\u2019s Full Frontal.\nFull Frontal | TBS\nBased on Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s award winning 2013\nEdinburgh play of the same name, Fleabag tells the story\nof a young woman\u2019s attempts at getting through modern\nLondon life. It\u2019s humour and razor sharp and pitch black,\nand the show manages to hook in just enough moments\nof genuine emotion and drama to keep you interested\nthroughout its all too short 6 episode run.\n5\nFleabag |\nBBC/Amazon\nAnurag Deshpande\n\\\\ Netflix\n\\\\FX\n\\\\HBO\n\\\\TBS\n\\\\BBC\\Amazon\n\n"

Most trans\nstudents are uncomfortable\nin gendered toilets and\nwill usually try and find\none that is gender neutral,\nespecially during big socials,\nwhen people tend to drink\nand are more likely to act\ninappropriately.\nWhile Imperial has made\nsome progress, introducing\nseveral gender neutral toilets\nin the last couple of years,\nthere is still a lot of work to be\ndone. The Union bar gender-neutral toilet, for example, is\nalmost always in use, as is the\nMetric gender-neutral toilet,\ndue to it being the nearest one\nto the dancefloor. This means\nthat, despite such facilities\nexisting, trans students don\u2019t\nnecessarily have easy access\nto a gender neutral option.\n\u201cI often have problems in\nbathrooms, but this was the\nfirst time it was physical, and\nhad I been alone or in an\nunfamiliar environment, or\nhad I not been significantly\nlarger than the girl, it would\nhave been a lot more of a\nupsetting experience.

So, is\nthe College actually better at\ntreating the animals used for\nresearch properly? There\u2019s an\nargument that we were never\nreally that bad. One\u2019s thing\nfor certain, we\u2019re definitely\nbetter at talking about it.\nI\nmperial has had a pretty\nrocky history with Animal\nResearch within the\nCollege and its public\nimage.

Imperial College\nhas been presented with a\nHighly Commended award\nin the category of Public\nEngagement Activity at the\nannual awards for Openness\nthe Freedom of Information\nAct showed that Imperial was\nfailing to provide 24-hour care\nfor animals. This was disputed\nby the College with an Imperial\nspokeswoman stating that\noutside normal working hours,\nthere was \u201calways at least one\nvet and five senior animal care\nstaff on call\u201d to attend to any\nemergencies. She continued,\n\u201cThe college complies with\nthe Home Office\u2019s regulations\nconcerning out-of-hours care,\nand works closely with the\nHome Office as regulator,\u201d.\nAs far as the actual levels of\nanimal research at College are\nThe facilites aren\u2019t always available though \\\\ felix\npast the CFI (Cruelty Free\nInternational) investigation\nin 2013 that alleged\n\u201cappalling animal suffering\non a very large scale\u201d on\nthe Hammersmith campus,\neven with only five of the\n180 charges from the report\nsubstantiated by the Home\nOffice.

Kendrick Lamar\n\u201cUntitled Unmastered\u201d\nIn March Kendrick surprised fans with a compilation of unused demos recorded during the making of 2015\u2019s To Pimp\na Butterfly, his 3rd\nstudio album. Kendrick previewed three of the tracks on late night talk shows throughout 2015 and\nduring his performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards. Kendrick continues to push the envelope with his alternative\napproach, regularly incorporating live instrumentation, soul and jazz into his music. \u201cCornrow Kenny, he was born with a\nvision\u201d, Kendrick proclaims on Untitled 02 | 06.23.2014, and this vision shines through on this smooth project.\nTop Dawg entertainment\\\\\nWith countless rap and R&B projects dropping this year, 2016 has been an incredible year for\nhip-hop and urban culture. There\u2019s been an unprecedented wave of new music from giants in\nthe modern rap game, like Drake, Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West, to exciting debut albums\nfrom the budding stars, such as Tory Lanez and Isaiah Rashad. With 2016 coming to a close, the\nquestion is: What is the best project of the year so far?\nThe Sun\u2019s Tirade is the debut album from Isaiah Rahsad, Kendrick Lamar\u2019s label mate and one of the most exciting new artists from Top\nDawg Entertainment (TDE). This album serves as the follow-up to Rashad\u2019s 2014 project, Cilvia Demo and sees Rashad bringing chill vibes\nand his signature lyrical versatility to topics ranging from struggling through alcoholism to dealing with chronic apathy and a lack of pas-sion. Hopefully there\u2019s a lot more to come from him.\n8. Young Thug | Slime Season 3\nYoung Thug dropped Slime Season 3, the highly anticipated third and final instalment of his Slime Season projects in March. Young Thug\nis a rapper whose eccentric style divides opinion throughout the hip-hop community and he is one of the pioneers of the \u2018mumble rap\u2019\ntrend that seems to be dominating the so-called new school of rap and hip-hop (and simultaneously infuriating the old school hip-hop\npurists). I love his unique delivery and flow, although I admit there are times when it is difficult to tell if he is actually speaking English or\njust speaking Young Thug. That being said, once you\u2019re used to his special brand of rap, Young Thug provides the perfect hype music and\nthis album doesn\u2019t disappoint.\n\\\\ Atlantic Records\n7\n. TWENTY88\nTWENTY88\nBig Sean and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko\u2019s undeniable chemistry shines through on this chilled-out collaborative album, set in the year 2088.\nThe album takes us through the ups and downs of a modern day relationship from both the male and female perspective, with\nJhen\u00e9 delivering smooth, sensual vocals that perfectly complement Big Sean\u2019s hard-hitting bars and lyrical flow.\nt\nAndy\u2019s Top 10 hip-hop albums of 2016\n9. Isaiah Rashad | The Sun\u2019s Tirade\n6. Drake | Views\nThis has been a very, very big year for Drake. It saw him achieve his first number one single as a lead artist in Canada and on the US\nBillboard Hot 100 with the Caribbean-influenced One Dance and saw the release of Views, his behemoth fourth studio album. After\nbeing teased for almost two years, Views wentto sell over a million copies in its first week, gaining over half a billion streams and going\ndouble platinum in the US. It dominated the charts, sitting atop the Billboard 200 for ten consecutive weeks, making it Drake\u2019s most\nsuccessful album to date. However, despite the commercial success and countless award nominations, Views is not the album that we\nfans deserved after almost two years\u2019 worth of hype. The album is solid and has plenty of stellar, stand-out tracks but it lacks cohesion\nand the topics and themes had all been addressed by Drake in previous albums. Not many of the tracks would be out of place on\n2011\u2019s Take Care or 2013\u2019s Nothing Was The Same. Drake has struggled to artistically challenge himself to try something new. Despite\nthis, Views is one of the best hip-hop albums of 2016 and it is impossible to deny the six god\u2019s standing as one of the top five rappers in\nthe game with the incredible ability to make banger after banger. But does he write his own raps?\n\\\\ OVO Entertainment\nAndy Djaba\n3. Travis Scott | Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight\nTravis Scott\u2019s sophomore album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight was a pleasant surprise. His 2015 debut album, Rodeo, was enjoy-able, but such a strong follow up was unexpected. The stand out feature of Travis\u2019 music has always been his hard trap beats and he\ndelivers yet again on this project, blessing the fans with the perfect music for turning up. I still have no clue what the title \u201cBirds in the\nTrap Sing McKnight\u201d actually means but, in the immortal words of Travis Scott, \u2018it\u2019s lit\u2019!\n\\\\ Photo credit\nTop Dawg Entertainment\\\\\n4. ScHoolboy Q | Blank Face LP\nMain ScHoolboy Q is tHe yin to His TDE label mate Kendrick Lamar\u2019s yang. WHilst botH rappers often paint pictures of life on the\ntougH streets of Compton, Kendrick tries to put a more positive spin on it, attempting to deliver a more uplifting message. In stark\ncontrast, ScHoolboy\u2019s verses are dark, depicting the Harsh reality of His former life as a member of the Hoover Street Crips gang. THis\ncontrasting dynamic between the two TDE Heavyweights makes listening to tHeir music all the more entHralling and, on ScHoolboy\u2019s\nfourtH studio album, Blank Face LP, we are met witH a gritty gangster rap project witH sHades of old scHool Wu-Tang Clan influences\nthrougHout (ScHoolboy Q claimed tHat Wu-Tang Clan member GHostface KillaH was tHe inspiration beHind tHis album). If you\u2019re a\nTDE fan, check out tHe Black Hippy remix of That Part.\nMad Love Interscope \\\\\n2. Troy Lanez | I Told You\nSince the commercial success of his hit single, Say It, with plenty of radio play, Tory Lanez has gone from strength to strength and\nenjoyed a year of musical success. I Told You is his hard-hitting debut album and gives an autobiographical narrative of his whole life,\nfrom selling drugs in gangs to the present day, where he\u2019s trying to break into the hip-hop music scene and become \u201cthe biggest artist in\nthe whole world\u201d. If you really want to appreciate this album as Tory Lanez intended, listen to it once through in its entirety with all the\nskits so you can understand the whole story behind the lyrics. Tory Lanez has rubbed a lot of artists the wrong way with his unshakeable\nconfidence in his own abilities and there\u2019s an underlying beef brewing between himself and Drake as a result of this. Could he possibly\ncome for Drake\u2019s spot as the best rapper in Toronto?\n1. Chance the Rapper | Colouring Book\nMuch like the majority of Chance\u2019s post-\u201cAcid Rap\u201d music, Coloring Book is strongly influenced by gospel music, with almost all\nthe songs mentioning God in some way. Chance doesn\u2019t fit the mould of the typical rapper and the artistic progression from his\nprevious work can be clearly heard in each track on this album. Chance refuses to sell his music (instead releasing it all for free\nthrough various streaming platforms) and has adopted a strong anti-label stance, even dedicating the song No Problem to proclaiming his hatred of the control that major labels have over artists in the modern day music industry. Chance is living proof that\nartists can independently create music, retaining complete creative license and control over their work, and still have a huge impact\nin the music industry. He made history this year, with this album being the first to chart entirely due to streaming and the Grammys\nannouncing changes to their rules to allow stream-only albums to be made eligible for a Grammy. With Frank Ocean taking a leaf out\nof Chance\u2019s book and releasing Blonde independently, Chance is almost single-handedly sparking a huge change in the music industry\nand the control artists have over their own music.\n\\\\ Chance the Rapper\n5. Kanye West | The Life of Pablo\n2016 saw the return of Kanye West in all his glory with his 7th\nstudio album The Life of Pablo, which sees Kanye at his crazy, experimental and creative best. The heavy gospel influence throughout the album is apparent, with the hauntingly beautiful Ultralight Beam\na particular favourite. In true Kanye West fashion, there seemed to be endless controversy surrounding the release. From the numerous\ntitle changes to the now infamous Taylor Swift line in Famous, the lead up to the release of this album became a spectacle in itself. When\nYe described the album as a \u201cliving, breathing, changing creative expression\u201d, I didn\u2019t realise he meant that there would be countless\nchanges with the latest addition of the track Saint Pablo in June, four months after the album\u2019s initial release date. Ignoring all the confusion and distractions surrounding the album, it\u2019s safe to say this is one of Kanye\u2019s best bodies of work to date, with shades of \u2018the old\nKanye\u2019 even coming through at points.\n\\\\ Def Jam Recordings\n\n"

Last year cousin\nDave announced he had been ill\nfor some time at Christmas dinner\nand I projectile vomited across\nthe table onto him, so this year\nof course I\u2019ve bought him a car\nbattery and electrodes in order for\nhim to convert himself. Hopefully\nhe will manage to do it before the\npigs in blankets come out of the\noven. There is truly no better way\nof honouring the King of the Jews\nthan by eating phallic pig flesh\nwrapped in thin pig flesh.\nAnother thing that pulls my testicles during the Christmas season\n(other than your mum), is these lib-eral-joy-apologists who denounce\nusing the name Christmas. If\nyou are so mentally deluded as\nto celebrate a Christian festival\ndespite having no particular belief\nin the Almighty, then you should\njust go become a desert-dweller\nin the Middle East and live of off\nhummus. \u201cOh I just don\u2019t want to\nexclude anybody so I use Xmas.\u201d\nFUCK OFF YOU COMMUNIST.\n\u201cThe Modern-day Christmas has\nbecome so far removed from\nthe roots of the festival, I feel as\nthough it is no longer a religious\nfestival.\u201d I\u2019LL EAT YOUR PRESENTS\nTHEN SHALL I? \u201cI\u2019m Jewish so I celebrate Hanukkah instead.\u201d YOUR\nPEOPLE KILLED BABY JESUS STOP\nTRYING TO MAKE EXCUSES.\nAlso, if you want to give me a\npresent, it had better be made in\nthe UK or the USA, because if I see\nthe vaguest hint of Chinese influ-ence, I shall burn it in front of you\nwhilst playing the national anthem\nto repel the communist demons\nthey put in their products.\nAs I look back on the year,\nhowever, there are many things to\nbe thankful for. Barack HUSSEIN\nObama will finally be relinquishing his anti-white grasp upon our\nhouse, and we will finally have a\nleader who is savvy about business\nand will crush the Muslamic threat\nto the civilised world. Brexit now\nmeans that we will be able to\ndeport anybody vaguely ethnic\nnext year as soon as Act 56 or\nwhatever it is called is activated.\nFinally the mental illness of political\ncorrectness will also be stamped\nout, allowing for us to call out\nthose who wish to stop the four\nhorses of the apocalypse and the\neventual day of judgement will be\ncalled and all you non-believers\nwill be sent to the darkest depths\nof hell.\nC\nhristmas is too often\nthe focus of our end\nof year celebrations,\nwrapped in\ncommercialism and\nthe celebration\nof consuming animal corpses. I\nhowever, reject this imperialist-white-christian tradition in favour of\na tradition far more relevant to my\nsoul and spirit animal. This, for me,\nis kwanzaa. Granted I am a white\nmiddle-class man from Surrey,\nbut I have always had an affinity\nfor the motherland (jah rastafah).\nSince I live in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, It\nis easy to get traditional African\ndress although I do receive a lot\nmore odd looks from strangers\nwhen I am in my kanzu. I feel this is\nprobably because I have become\nless influenced by the colonialist\nWest than they have, and so it is\nnatural for them to feel jealous. I\njust want to reach out to any of my\nAfrican brothers, and if they feel as\nthough they have lost their way in\nthis white man\u2019s world, I can help\nthem return to becoming one with\nAfrica.\nIf you are too regressive in your\nwestern imperial ways and decide\nto celebrate CHRIST-MASS then I\nalso have a few unsolicited tips for\nmaking your Christmas less fun, but\nmore morally and spiritually sound.\nIn a lot of ways I feel like I already\nwrite a column for the Guardian,\nas I too am trying to make people\nmore miserable at the cost of being\nslightly more socially conscious.\nMy first piece of advice is to, of\ncourse, learn to love nuts and their\naffiliated roasts, as this is all I ate\nat Christmas when I was enslaved\nby white culture. The most common\nproblem with nuts at Christmas is\nthat they are too wrinkly. When\nsomeone puts their freshly made\nnuts in your mouth they should be\nsoft and plump and not too difficult\nto suck on. Whenever I have to put\nnuts in my mouth, I usually soak\nthem in some warm water so that\nthey taste fairly good when they\u2019re\ngoing down my throat.\nI also implore you, dear readers,\nto acknowledge your trees\u2019 gender\nbefore you start to decorate it willy\nnilly. Too often do I see the festive\nbasket of deplorables bestow this\nheteronormative decoration of\ntinsel and baubles, without any\nacknowledgement of the tree\u2019s\npreferred pronouns. If your tree\nchooses to identify itself as male,\nplease consider to treat it as such:\nstart decorating it with steaks and\ncars, and pay 9.4% more for the\ntree as it will be working harder\nas well as not having to taken time\noff for self-indulgent pregnancy.\nTHE WORLD IS OVERPOPULATED\nPEOPLE.\nIn whatever capacity you choose\nto celebrate winter festivities, I\nhope you honestly have a good\ntime off; however, do not forget\nthat whilst you\u2019re enjoying your\nturkey, hundreds of Syrian nationals will die under Assad\u2019s regime.\nGod I\u2019m good. I hope the Guardian notice me soon.\nReject the\ncommercialisation of\nChristmas and get back\nto your African roots\nJonathan Masters is a white\nmiddle-class man from Surrey, but\nstill misses the motherland\nChristmas should be\na time for shunning\ncertain members of\nyour family\nMonathan Jasters explains why\ncelebrating the birth of baby\nJesus is the first step towards a\nbetter world\nS\nV\n* Sponsored by\nBaby Jesus\n\n"

Luckily\ngreat sacks by Defensive\nMVP Harry \u2018one true\ngreb\u2019 Lawrence, and some\nquestionable throws by the\nPirates\u2019 QB turned the ball\nover.

Immortals offense\nreally struggled to move the\nball despite great blocking\nfrom rookie Gatis \u2018Fatis ;)\u2018\nOgle, who was awarded Line\nMVP. No more points were\nscored by Immortals for the\nrest of the game.

You can\neven try to double grade (skip\na belt) if you\u2019re very keen.\nYou can graduate every three\nmonths up to your purple belt\nbut then it\u2019s at least six month\nbetween each belt, and finally\nmore than a year between\nbrown and black belt.\nThe whole point is to impress\nthe panel of instructors\ngathered specially for the\ngrading, so they give you that\nbelt you\u2019ve been working so\nhard for. This year novices\nwere evaluated for more than\ntwo hours, and all the higher\ngrades for three hours mini-mum. I\u2019m not going to lie, it\nis very hard and very intense\n(insert innuendo). Jitsukas\nare examined on their technique and knowledge of the\nsyllabus (the higher you go,\nthe more you need to know)\nas well as demonstrating all\nthat under pressure, and their\nattacking on other jitsukas.\nDuring the grading there\nwill be times when you can\ndemonstrate the technique in\npairs, slowly, and times when\nyou will be put under pressure and have to deal with\nthe attackers quickly.\nTo recap, in a grading\nyou need to be calm and in\ncontrol, know your stuff, AND\nKEEP UP THE INTENSITY! If\nthe main instructor notices\nany drop in intensity, the\nparticipants are going to stay\nthere for a very, very long\ntime\u2026 The aim of the instructors is to push everyone to\ntheir limits, to see how much\nthey actually know the jitsu\nthey need to know.\nAnyway, after the hard\nstuff comes the fun stuff:\nafter-grading party! Time\nto let loose and buy a drink\nfor that person from King\u2019s\nor Queen Mary\u2019s that you\npunched in the face a bit too\nhard. Also, time to know if\nyou\u2019ve succeeded and got\nyour new belt or not, then\nyou can celebrate.

We built a cute little gingerbread house. It only took one batch of gingerbread and a few sweets for\ndecoration, and it disappeared remarkably quickly. How things were to change!\n2010 | The castle\nThis took two whole batches of gingerbread. We wanted to top the previous\nyear, and this seemed like the obvious next step. We were so impressed at the time\nwith the four towers, complete with crenelations.\n2011 | The bridge\nThis used gingercake to create a valley and gingerbread created the suspension\nbridge spanning the gap. The first creation that required significant architectural\nplanning, although decoration was less exciting.\n2012 | The train\nWe had to scale down the production during baking because we hadn\u2019t considered that the size of the oven was a limiting\nfactor. Still, we produced a three-carriage train with a single piece cylindrical body for the engine. Unfortunately, there\nwas a roof collapse in one of the carriages, causing the creation to have a plot line of being invaded by alien mice.\n2013 | St Basil\u2019s Cathedral (which is not the\nKremlin, FYI)\nThe first of the truly ambitious biscuit architecture. Consisting of eight towers,\neach topped with an onion dome, with colours and patterns carefully reproduced to match the original. It weighed 40kg, and it was beautiful. Decorative\nEaster eggs included an homage to Petr Pavlensky, who nailed his scrotum to\nRed Square, and a LGBT+ pride mural on the outer walls.\n2015 | La Sagrada Familia (completed\ndesign)\nSome said it was stupid to attempt to recreate (to scale) a\nbuilding that has been under construction for 134 years and isn\u2019t\neven half built. It was a titan of modular construction, weighing in\nat around 70kg, with more than 500 individual pieces. Each of\nthe eighteen towers were built to scale, and the main body of the\ncathedral was complete with stained glass. Unfortunately, we ran\nout of time to finish the facades, but it was by far the most impressive creation so far.\n2016 | Hogwarts\nWe\u2019d tried scaling up, and we couldn\u2019t keep adding towers, so this was the year of technical baking. The\nchallenge: build all the towers as cylindrical and conical pieces. With several towers of different sizes, halls,\ncourtyards, and even an owlery, we spent weeks ahead of time drawing blueprints and crafting moulds. As\nan added challenge, we gave the whole thing a base of cake to add landscape, and the decorative attention\nto detail included a quidditch pitch, a somewhat questionable Dark Mark, and a student who may or may not\nbe escaping from the Giant Squid. This creation weighed in at more than 100kg, and posed new challenges of\nconfectionery distribution, as cake really doesn\u2019t keep as long as gingerbread.\nIt all started as friends in halls. The Christmas tradition started in 2008,\nand by 2009 we\u2019d first discovered gingerbread together. Since then, it\u2019s\nescalated, trying to be bigger and better each year. In a true Imperial\nspirit, we\u2019ve taken a scientific, competitive approach.\nWhat you\u2019ll need to\nmake Hogwarts\n72.5 batches of cake (145 eggs)\n37 batches of gingerbread\n16kg royal icing sugar\n1 litre lemon juice\n16 batches of buttercream\nSweets: we used 12kg\nTessa Davey, Beth Sheldon, and Susie Carlson\nIngredients:\n454g plain flour\n227g soft brown sugar\n170g margarine\n1 egg\n4 tbsp golden syrup\n2 tbsp dried ginger\n1 tbsp cinnamon\nIngredients:\nThe cake\n125g butter (or\nmargarine)\n125g caster sugar\n125g self-raising flour\n2 eggs\n1 tsp baking powder\n1 tsp vanilla extract\nPumpkin spice butter-cream\n225g butter, softened\n\u00bd can pureed pumpkin\n1 kg icing sugar\n1 tsp vanilla extract\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\u00bd tsp nutmeg\nApple cinnamon but-tercream\n500g butter, softened\n1.2 kg icing sugar\n2 tbsp applesauce\n1 tbsp vanilla extract\n2 tsp cinnamon\n\u00bc tsp fine salt\n3 tbsp lukewarm water\nThe gingerbread\nUsing your hands or a mixer\n(we recommend a mixer\nfor large quantities), mix\ntogether all the ingredients\nuntil it forms an even ball.\nMake sure that the sugar\nand margarine are evenly\ndistributed throughout. Roll\nThe cake\nWe kept it simple with\nvanilla sponge and jazzed\nit up with flavoured but-tercreams, but you could\nsubstitute any flavourings to\nthe sponge. Using a mixer,\nadd all the ingredients and\nmix until well combined and\nvery light and airy. For best\nresults, it should have taken\non a mousse-like consistency.\nIf preparing by hand, first\ncream together the butter\nand sugar, before gradually\nintroducing the remaining\ningredients, beating con-stantly. Pour into a baking\npaper lined tin, and bake at\n175\u00b0C (fan) for around 15-20\nminutes, depending on the\nthickness of the cake, until\na skewer comes out clean.\nWe scaled this up to five-egg batches, which took 28\nminutes to bake in a 35x24cm\ncake tin.\nTo make the buttercreams,\nbeat together all of the ingredients and mix until smooth.\nUse them as layering between\nsponges, and to coat the\noutside of the cake. If desired,\nadd food colouring \u2013 you\nmay have to add extra icing\nsugar to compensate.\nThe templates\nFirst, you need to make\nyour design, and draw some\ntemplates. These days, we use\nCAD software for the more\ncomplex shapes, but most\nthings can be easily sketched\nout on a piece of paper\nwith the use of some basic\ngeometry.\nHow to start your first gingerbread construction\nout to the desired thickness\n\u2013 just over half a centimetre\nfor gingerbread men, just\nunder half a centimetre for\nconstruction. To get the best\nresults, roll out between\nsheets of baking paper\n(watch out for creasing). Bake\nat 180\u00b0C for 8-10 minutes\n(for soft gingerbread biscuits),\nor slightly longer for larger\nconstruction pieces. You want\nan even, dark colour all over\nthe biscuit \u2013 you should be\nable to see when it is cooked.\nOur largest pieces (around\n40x40cm) took around 18\nminutes to bake, but in my\nexperience, this is very oven\ndependent.\nAssembly and decoration\nOnce all the gingerbread\npieces have cooled on wire\nracks, you can start building.\nTo assemble your gingerbread masterpiece, you\u2019re\ngoing to need some glue.\nIn the spirit of gingerbread\nassembly, there must be\nnothing that is not edible\non the construction when\nWhen building things out\nof gingerbread, some level\nof care and precision is\nrequired. As you scale up the\noperation, the importance\nof this increases, and several\nother factors come into play.\nAs the engineers out there\nmay have identified, these\nit is unveiled. This means\nedible glue. For the strength\nrequired, you\u2019re going to\nneed royal icing. You can\nmake this with regular icing\nsugar and egg whites, but\nfor consistency, royal icing\nsugar and enough lemon\njuice to bring it together into\na stiff, barely pipable paste\ndo the job just fine. Put it into\na piping bag (you can make\none by folding some baking\npaper and cutting off the end)\nand start assembling your\ngingerbread. The icing will\nsoften in your hands, so if it\nfeels a little stiff at first, don\u2019t\nworry.\nStart by sticking the first\npieces to your base (we\nrecommend assembling on\nbaking paper), and then seal\nany edges between them.\nWait for each layer to set (for\naround 15 minutes) before\nadding more pieces above it.\nOnce your assembly is com-plete, use royal icing to glue\nedible decorations all over\nyour beautiful masterpiece.\nproblems include (1) the swelling of the gingerbread during\nthe bake, (2) the strength and\nweightbearing requirements\nof the individual pieces, and\n(3) the choice between flat\nand curved pieces.\nThe gingerbread growth\nproblem\nNo matter how carefully\nyou cut out your stencils, the\nshape you put into the oven\nis not going to be quite the\nshape that you get out. This\nisn\u2019t always a huge problem,\nbut if you\u2019re a perfectionist,\nyou can fix it. Gingerbread\ncomes out of the oven soft,\nand then hardens as it cools,\nso you have some time.\nUsing a sharp knife, trim\nback any edges that need to\nbe straight, or even use the\nstencil to reshape the biscuit.\nYou can do this at any point\nduring the second half of the\nbaking time, or straight away\nwhen it comes out the oven.\nThe tensile strength of\ngingerbread\nWho hasn\u2019t thought about\ntaking some cookies into the\nlab and testing them out on\nan Instrom machine? Well,\nwe didn\u2019t do it for you, but we\ndo have years of experience\nin baking the gingerbread\ndifferently to achieve different\nstrength properties. Thicker,\nsofter gingerbread is more\ndelicious, but has a tendency\nto bow if it needs to support\nmore than one layer above it.\nThe solution: thinner, crisper\npieces. Roll slightly thinner,\nand bake longer at a cooler\ntemperature, and at optimum\nconditions, the gingerbread\nwill form a hard, glass-like\nsolid. It\u2019s not so good for\neating (yet), but it\u2019s great\nfor building. \u2018Structural\u2019\ngingerbread, as we call it, will\nactually soften into delicious\ngingerbread after a day or\nso, so by baking in this way,\nyou don\u2019t have to be wasting\nfood.\nBy doing this, as well as\napplying some basic engineering principles such as\nusing cross-pieces to minimise\nweight load, and bracing\nany pieces that seem to be\nstruggling, you can build\na veritable Tower of Babel\nout of gingerbread without\nproblems.\nThe new 3D printing\nIf constructing a building\nout of flat, rectangular pieces\nis like first year, baking solid\n3D shapes successfully is\nworth a PhD. We\u2019ve spent\nyears working on a seamless\ngingerbread curve, and\nwe\u2019ve learnt that getting it\nright means requires constant\nattention, fairly serious burns,\nand carefully thought out\nmoulds. Moulds should be\nas solid as possible, easy to\nplace the gingerbread on\nto, and very easy to take the\ngingerbrad off. Ideally, allow\nairflow within the mould for\nan even bake.\nBake it low and slow, but\nwatch out that the gingerbread doesn\u2019t stretch too\nmuch during the baking. You\nmay need to reshape and\ntouch up the piece when it\u2019s in\nthe oven. Trim where needed,\nand if any cracks appear, you\ncan patch them with dough\nwithin the first eight minutes\nor so.\nSome notes on structural baking\n\n"

However the\nrefurbishment has come\nunder fire with students\ncharacterising it as \u201crushed\u201d\nand \u201cshoddy\u201d despite it\nreportedly costing somewhere\nbetween \u00a310-60 million (these\nare from a range of estimates).\nOngoing issues allegedly\ninclude overheated rooms\ndue to boiler maintenance, rat\ninfestations in the communal\nkitchens, poorly managed\ngarbage disposals, lack of\ncold water in bedroom sinks,\ninsufficient laundry facilities,\nand poor carpentry resulting\nin heat loss problems for\nmultiple rooms. The list goes\non and on.\nBut these seem like minor\ninconveniences compared to\nthe onslaught of problems that\noriginally plagued the newly\nrefurbished halls.

As with any\nbuilding project of this kind,\nsome concerns were identified\nonce the buildings were\noccupied as part of a bedding-in process. We apologise to\nany students who have been\naffected. The College has\ntaken swift action to address\nthese while making efforts to\nminimise disruption to students\nliving there and will continue\nto do so.\n\u201cWe are aware of\nsome reports of pests at\nEvelyn Gardens since the\nrefurbishment works finished\nand we are working with\ncontractors on site to address\nthis as soon as possible.\u201d\nany hot water. Following that\nincident, the top floor flooded\ndue to the overflowing of the\nroof tank (which is the main\nsource of water for most of\nthe in-room faucets, making\nthe water undrinkable). For\nthe first half of October,\nthere were no washing and\ndrying facilities reportedly\ndue to the manufacturers\nbeing unable to come and\nprogram the appliances. And\nthere\u2019s also one report of a\nwasp infestation that lasted\napproximately five weeks.\n\u201cI am paying \u00a370 more\na week to live in the same\nlocation as last year, yet I\nnever had any of these issues\nat Fisher Hall.

When\nthe contractor did come to my\nroom, he dialled the heater up\nto the maximum temperature,\nthen removed the control\nhandle. Imagine the surprise\nto return to a room thirty\ndegrees hotter than outdoors!\nAfter getting over the heater-induced asphyxiation, I told\nthe concierge about this defect\n(who are caring, dutiful and\nconsiderate), but they couldn\u2019t\ndo much other than lodge a\nreport with the contractors.\u201d\nWilliams ultimately had to go\nto the student Hub to get the\nissue resolved.\nHe then offers to show us\nhis assigned kitchen space.\nThe kitchen is located three\nfloors down and through the\nneighbouring building.\n\u201cThere are problems with\nthe renovation. They haven\u2019t\ncompleted the build.

Of particular\ninterest were the impacts of\nthis culture on gender equality\nso as to propose a workframe\nfor tackling institutional\nsexism, which is commendable\nconsidering the potential\ndamage any findings could\ndo.\nIndeed,attheverystartofthe\nreport, it reads \u201cthe Provost\u2019s\nBoard recognised that some\nof the project findings might\nnot show the College in its\nbest light but the opportunity\nfor the organisation, and the\nwider sector, to learn and\nrespond to the research was\nconsidered more important\nthan any natural concern\nabout potential negative\npublicity\u201d.\nAnd certainly, the findings\ndon\u2019t paint a flattering\npicture of Imperial: a picture\nof pressure, \u2018elite\u2019 white\nmasculinity, silence and\ntokenism.\nThe main pillar of the\nCollege\u2019s culture is excellence.\nIt\u2019s part of the brand. The\nfirst line of the introduction\nat Imperial\u2019s website reads\n\u201cImperial College London is a\nscience-based university with\nan international reputation\nfor excellence in teaching\nand research.\u201d Yet, this\nobsession with excellence\nbreeds competition rather\nthan collaboration and\ncreates an environment\nwhere the inability to cope\nwith the pressures and stress\nof academia is perceived\nas a weakness instead of a\nproblem in need of support.\nTheresa Davey, a materials\nPhD student who has spent\nalmost a decade at Imperial\nCollege agrees: \u201cImperial\ndoes produce excellent work\nbut it\u2019s at the expense of\nmental health and happiness\nof the people here\u201d\nIssues such as students\nconcealing their vulnerabilities\nfrom their peers, experiencing\nbullying in work and study\nhierarchies, and even the lack\nof community spaces are all\nnoted in the report.\nOn an undergraduate\nlevel these pressures may\nbe remedied through\nparticipation in social\nactivities within College\u2019s\nhundreds of student led\nclubs and societies. \u201cThis is\ndefinitely a space that has\nhelped a lot of people through\nbreak ups, mental health\nissues, suicide attempts,\u201d says\nKsenia Solovieva, a physics\nundergraduate currently\nbetween her first and second\nyear, referring to the safe\nhaven that the Sci-fi and\nFantasy library is for many\nstudents. \u201cI\u2019m not good friends\nwith anyone from my year, all\nmy friends have come through\nsocieties\u201d When asked why,\nthe answer is simple: \u201cIt\u2019s not\ncompetitive here. [In your\ndepartment] you compare\nyourself to your peers \u2018cause\nyou might be working on the\nsame problem but they\u2019re five\nsteps ahead and you realise\nyou\u2019re not that great\u201d\nFor postgraduates and staff,\nopportunities for healthy\nsocialising outside the work\nenvironment might be even\nfewer and the pressures\neven more real. The degree\nof participation in society\nevents and union campaigns\nplummets as soon as the\ntransition is made from the\nundergraduate to the\npostgraduate or staff level.\n\u201cThrough the Graduate\nSchool,Collegeprovidesfunds\nfor cohort building amongst\npostgraduates, however, these\nresources are very underused\nand few people know about\nthem\u201d, says Davey.\nOn top of that, there is\nwidespread misogyny and\nhomophobia, the effects\nof which are augmented\nby the highly pressurised\nenvironment. According to\none of the testimonials cited\nin the report, \u201cthe \u2018ingrained\nmisogyny\u2019 at Imperial was\nso deep that it had become\nnormal\u201d. The event that\nsparked the investigation is\nonly the tip of the iceberg.\nEarlier in October, an entire\ncampaign was launched,\naiming at promoting sport\namongst Imperial\u2019s female\npopulation only to land flat on\nitsfaceafterbeingcriticisedfor\nthe sexist undertones of events\nwhich called at participants to\n\u201cburn the calories away\u201d.\nEven prestigious initiatives\nsuch as the Athena SWAN\nscheme were criticised in the\nreport as failing to effectively\ntarget gender inequality, with\nparticipants accusing the\nscheme of having \u201cscratched\nthe surface of issues\u201d or\nThis word cloud was included in the report \\\\ Imperial College London\n\\\\ the \u2018ingrained\nmisogyny\u2019 at\nImperial was so\ndeep that it had\nbecome normal \\\\\n\n"

    "content": "felix C U L T U R E\n18 felixonline.co.uk/culture culture.felix@ic.ac.uk Friday 16 December 2016\nBy Andy Djaba\nJ\nCole\u2019s last album\nrelease, 2014\nForest Hills Drive,\nreceived critical\nacclaim and was\nmet with exceptional\ncommercial success, making it\nthe first LP in 25 years to sell\nover a million copies without\na guest appearance. On\nNovember 27th\n2015, J. Cole\nand Kendrick Lamar raised\nfans\u2019 hopes of finally hearing\ntheir rumoured joint album by\nsimultaneously dropping their\nBlack Friday freestyles over\neach other\u2019s beats. On Cole\u2019s\nBlack Friday he had his fans\u2019\nhearts racing by ending the\nsong with, \u201cBut this February,\nbet shit get scary when I fuck\naround and drop\u2026\u201d, however\nFebruary 2016 came and\nwent and shit did not get\nscary\u2026 J. Cole had gone\ninto recluse mode. In July\n2016, J. Cole featured on DJ\nKhaled\u2019s monster Major Key\nalbum, appearing on fifth\ntrack, Jermaine\u2019s Interlude\nexploring topics ranging\nfrom police brutality to his\ninternal struggle. He ends his\nverse toying with the idea of\nretirement- \u201cSaid all I could\nsay, now I play with thoughts\nof retirement\u201d- which had\nfans worried that we\u2019ve heard\nthe last of J. Cole, especially\ngiven his well-documented\ndislike for the fame which\naccompanies commercial\nsuccess in the music industry.\nThe fans\u2019 excitement was\npractically palpable when,\non December 1st, the artwork\nand track listing of J. Cole\u2019s\nlatest offering, 4 Your Eyez\nOnly, were made available\nfor pre-order. The album\nwas eventually released last\nFriday, marking the two-year\nanniversary of the release of\n2014 Forest Hills Drive and\ncame with little promotion,\nsave for a 40-minute\ndocumentary Eyez and two\nteaser tracks, False Prophets\nand Everybody Dies. These\ntracks didn\u2019t make the album,\nbut still made waves, laden\nwith subliminal disses aimed\nat the likes of Kanye West,\nWale and the so-called new\nschool of hip-hop.\nOnce again, Cole has\nopted to go solo and release\nan album with no guest\nappearances. The album\u2019s\ntitle references 2Pac\u2019s classic\nAll Eyez On Me, with both\nof these marking the two\nrappers\u2019 fourth studio albums\nrespectively. Within hours\nof its release, a fan theory\nsuggested the underlying\nnarrative of the album tells\nthe true story of the life of\nJ. Cole\u2019s late friend, James\nMcMillan Jr. (Cole may have\nchanged the name to honour\nhis late friend\u2019s memory), as\nhe goes from selling drugs\nand generally leading a life\nof crime to falling in love,\nhaving a daughter and\nattempting to turn his life\naround. This theory has since\nbeen confirmed by J. Cole\u2019s\nproducer, Elite.\nThe album opener, For\nWhom the Bell Tolls, is much\nlike the intro tracks to Cole\u2019s\nprevious albums in that it is a\nmelodic slow jam. The song\nrefers to the ringing of funeral\nbells and the title references\nErnest Hemingway\u2019s 1940\nnovel of the same name. Like\nHemingway\u2019s novel, this song\ncentres on themes of death\nand suicide and serves as\na dark introduction to the\nrelationships and love. The\nkeener listeners amongst you\nmight notice that the beat is\nalmost identical to that behind\nBryson Tiller\u2019s Exchange\nand this has sparked beef\nbetween producers Boi-1da,\nVinylz and ForeignTeck over\nwho originally produced the\nethereal infectious beat. The\nfourth track, \u201cVille Mentality\u201d,\nreturns to the narrative. Cole\nhas previously mentioned\nVille mentality, describing\nit as the misconception that\nopportunity is not present\nin his small town. The track\nincludes a spoken interlude\nfrom a little girl telling us\nabout her dead father. This\nleads nicely into the stunning\nShe\u2019s Mine, Pt.1, in which\nCole focuses on falling in\nlove. Foldin Clothes and the\nsecond part, She\u2019s Mine, Pt.\n2, further explore the themes\nof love and fatherhood and\ntheir power to inspire a man\nto make a change in his life\nand reassess his priorities in\nlife. \u201cYou are now the reason\nthat I fight// I ain\u2019t never\ndid nothing this right in my\nwhole life\u201d. On the sixth track\nChange, Cole talks about\nmaturing from the mind state\nshown in tracks like Immortal\nand also reveals his guilt over\nJames\u2019 murder at age 22.\nIn the song\u2019s outro, we hear\na news report about James\u2019\nmurder and the re-enact-ment of James\u2019 funeral. The\nseventh track, Neighbours,\nbriefly departs the narrative\nso Cole can tell a story from\nhis own perspective and\ntouch on the broader topic\nof race relations in America.\nThe true story refers to an\nincident where a house in\nNorth Carolina that Cole\nhad rented for studio use\nwas raided by a SWAT team\nfollowing complaints from\nneighbours. Upon seeing so\nmany black people coming\nand going from the property\nin the predominantly white\nneighbourhood, the neighbours assumed that the house\nwas being used to produce\nand sell drugs. The album\nends with the nine-minute\noutro 4 Your Eyez Only, in\nwhich J. Cole reveals the\nalbum was created by James\nfor his daughter to listen to\nafter he dies: \u201cWrite my story\ndown and if I pass// Go play\nit for my daughter when she\nready// And so I\u2019m leaving\nyou this record for your eyes\nonly\u201d. In the track, he reveals\nJames\u2019 worst fear that his\ndaughter will one day come\nhome from school to see\non the news that he\u2019s been\nkilled. This fear unfortunately\ncame to pass, as the final\nverse is told from J. Cole\u2019s\nperspective.\nIn the current hip-hop\nculture, it is refreshing to hear\na calm album with no recognisable hype tunes which\ndiscusses more pertinent\nsubject matter.\n\\\\ The underlying\nnarrative of the\nalbum tells the true\nstory of the life of\nJ. Cole\u2019s late friend\nJames McMillan \\\\\nalbum. In the second track,\nImmortal, Cole spits some\nlyrical heat and continues to\nexplore the theme of death\nwhile also lamenting the\npopular misconception that,\nto be a successful black man\nin America, you have to deal\ndrugs or be an athlete or\nmusician: \u201cThey tellin\u2019 niggas\nsell dope, rap or go to NBA,\nin that order// It\u2019s that sort\nof thinkin\u2019 that been keepin\u2019\nniggas chained\u201d. The third\ntrack, Deja Vu, briefly departs\nfrom the album\u2019s narrative as\nCole addresses a female love\ninterest and discusses sex,\n4 Your Eyez Only\nJ Cole review\n\\\\ Dreamville Records\n\n"

Perhaps there is\nsomething cathartic about\nreading of other people\u2019s\nregrets, regrets that are\ndisturbingly close to home\nyet safely ensconced in the\nrealm of fiction. Perhaps it is\nthe ritual of a young person\ntrying to pre-empt and avoid\nthe dark and looming future \u2013\nas if reading about them will\nprevent me from falling into\nsimilar traps of life.\nBut what Philip Roth\u2019s deceptively short and simple novel\nEveryman tells us, is that no\none plans to fall into these\ntraps in the first place. In fact,\nthese characters that we see\nstruggling to come to terms\nwith their past are struggling\nprecisely because their life\ndid not turn out as they had\nimagined it would. It is a\nstruggle for answers to things\nthat sometimes simply have\nno explanation.\n2016 has been a year of\nmajor global events, disappointments and uncertainties\n\u2013 victories to some, but tragedies to many others. Someone\nin the future might look back\nand point at this or that\nincident as a turning point,\nbut just like the Everyman as\nhe is running the course of\nhis life, we are caught in the\npresent, swept by the tide\nof events, and as clueless as\nthe next person about how\nthings might pan out in the\nyears to come. What of the\nindividual\u2019s place in all this\nturmoil? The ordinary life\nplods along. Everyman is\nindeed a depressing book to\nreflect upon at the close of the\nyear, but for me it is the kind\nof reminder I need in order to\nharness the burst of energy\nthat the new year unfailingly\naffords. After all, is not the\nnew year a time for forgiveness and perhaps absolution?\n\u2018Everyman\u2019 refers to the\n15th-century play, in which\nan unprepared sinner is told\nby Death of his imminent\njudgement day. Before\nhis maker, his friends and\nfamily leave him, as does\nhis wealth, beauty and\nknowledge \u2013 what is left are\nhis good deeds alone. Roth\u2019s\nnovel opens with the burial\nof the nameless Everyman,\nsurrounded by a smattering\nof people connected to him\nin life. Once the mourners\ndepart, however, Roth\u2019s\nEveryman recounts his life\nand makes his case for sympathy while reconciling with\nhis own actions.\nWhat is remarkable about\nthe book is the utter ordinariness of the Everyman and\nEvery man\u2019s read for the new year\nJingjie Cheng\nPhilip Roth's profoud novel tests our values \\\\ Creative Commons\nhis utterly unremarkable, and\nhence relatable, life. Never\nnamed throughout the novel,\nhis life could belong to any\none of us. His major afflictions\n\u2013 failed marriages, loneliness,\na lost passion for painting,\nand failing health \u2013 could\napply to anyone in some form\nor another. Thrice married,\nmuch of the Everyman\u2019s\nwistfulness seems to stem from\nallowing his second marriage\nto fail due to his philandering actions. He is never able\nto account to himself for\nleaving a reliable, kind wife\nand mother of his beloved\ndaughter for a woman half his\nage. It is lust that destroyed\nhim, but even in his old age\nit is lust that keeps him going.\nInstead of trying to explain\naway his actions, he repeatedly reminds the reader of\nhow grateful he is for what\nhe has \u2013 his forgiving and\nunfailingly kind daughter\nNancy and Howie, the older\nbrother that has cared for him\nand been his inspiration since\nchildhood.\nIn the throes of his ailing\nbody \u2013 \u201celuding death\nseemed to have become the\ncentral business of his life\u201d\n\u2013 Roth\u2019s Everyman clings to\nmemories of his blissful childhood helping his father out\nin his jewellery repair shop.\nAfter leaving the residential\nhome he moves to the shore\nin an attempt to recreate his\nchildhood days spent surfing\nat sea. We learn the comforting role memories play in\nold age and sickness \u2013 when\nthe Everyman learns of colleagues in hospital or dying,\nhe calls them, and recounts\ntheir old times at work, sharing laughter over old jokes.\nHe tides over the agony of\nhis multiple angioplasties by\nremembering the watches\nand clocks his father used to\nsell, recalling their images in\ndetail until the procedures\nwere over.\n\u201cOld age isn\u2019t a battle; old\nage is a massacre\u201d \u2013 the\nEveryman is surrounded by\nthe dead and dying, and is\npreoccupied in most of the\nbook with his own steady\nmarch towards the end. It\nseems to be a battle of mind\nover matter, as he tries to\nsustain himself with memories,\nruminations, and his passion\nfor painting while his body\nfades away. There is frustration \u2013 he is intensely jealous\nof his older brother\u2019s good\nhealth despite his devotion to\nhim \u2013 but there is also a gradual sense of resignation and\nnewfound appreciation for\nwhat he has left. Eventually\nwe come to the realization\nthat it is all well and good\nto find explanations, but as\nhe tells Nancy, and Nancy\nrepeats to his spirit in the\ngrave, \u201cThere\u2019s no remaking\nreality. Just take it as it comes.\nHold your ground and take it\nas it comes. There\u2019s no other\nway.\u201d\nEveryman is not a cheerful\nread, but the kind that makes\nyou buried deep in rumination for a long time. The kind\nthat makes you stop to consider where your life is going\nand shakes the foundations\nof your values to test their\nintegrity.\nJ\nust before the start\nof the performance,\nas we, the soon-to-be-audience, stand\npacked like sardines\ninto the small lobby\nof the King\u2019s Cross Theatre,\nthe sirens go off. The chatter\nfalls silent in the face of\nthe piercing wail, followed\nby an uniformed prison\nofficer pushing through the\ncrowd \u2013 \u201cprisoners coming\nthrough!\u201d The cast, dressed\nin grey sweats and hoodies,\nmarch past into the theatre,\nfaces set in grim defiance.\nThe Donmar Warehouse\u2019\nShakespeare Trilogy, made\nup of The Tempest, Henry\nIV, and Julius Caesar, marks\ndirector Phyllida Lloyd\u2019s\nreturn to the Donmar with her\nall-female cast adaptation\nof Shakespeare. The return\nis triumphant; the plays feel\njust as revolutionary, just as\nexhilarating as they were\nfour years ago when the first\niteration of Julius Caesar with\nan all-female cast was staged\nat the Donmar in 2012.\nThe performances are plays\nwithin plays \u2013 the setting is in\na women\u2019s prison, the conceit\nbeing that the prisoners are\nperforming Shakespeare\u2019s\nworks as part of an educational programme. At the\nbeginning of the performance\nJade Anouka reads aloud\nfrom a scrap of paper: \u201cthis\nplay gave me my voice...I\nhope you enjoy it,\u201d and what\na voice it is \u2013 Anouka as\nAnthony lights up the stage\nfrom the first moment, singing\na pop ballad to introduce the\nreturn of his beloved Caesar.\nIn the background for long\nstretches the opening act,\nAnouka once again smoulders in Act III Scene II in the\n\u201cfriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d speech.\nHarriet Walter worked\nwith Phyllida Lloyd on the\noriginal run of Julius Caesar\nin 2012, and now she returns\nas Brutus in Caesar, the lead\nin Henry IV, and Prospero in\nThe Tempest. She lends Brutus\na wiry sort of inner strength,\nfrom his reticence in the first\nact as Cassius implores Brutus\nto recognise within himself\nwhat the rest of Rome already\nsee \u2013 his capability to be a\ngreat leader \u2013 to the rather\nmore confident and grandiose\nspeeches that Brutus delivers\nlater in the play. Walter\u2019s\nstage experience and classical training show in her subtle\nperformance. Her scenes particularly with Claire Dunne as\nPortia are exquisite to watch.\nIn understated gestures both\nWalter and Dunne portray\nimmense tenderness. In\nanother extraordinary scene,\nBrutus dances a slow waltz\nwith the ghost of Caesar as\nLucius plays an haunting\nmelody; at the corners of the\nstage other cast members\nstand with slowly rotating\ndisco balls so tiny sequins of\nlight glide over Brutus and\nthe ghost.

Yet the play at its\ncore is not a reflection of the\ncurrent political climate but\nan exploration of how society\ntreats powerful women, or\nwomen who crave power.\nCaesar is of course struck\ndown for being too ambitious.\nOctavius too is thwarted\n\u2013 when towards the end,\nOctavius begins to revel in\nhis victory the play within the\nplay is abruptly shut down.\nPrison guards enter the stage\nand haul off the women\nperforming. \u201cThat\u2019s not how\nit ends!\u201d cries Harriet Walter\nplaintively, the guards haul\nher off all the same.\nJulius Caesar is a play of\nrebellion and power strug-gles, yet the powerlessness\nof the imprisoned women\nis made clear \u2013 the stage\nis mocked up as basketball\ncourt outside the prison; the\naudience watch from the\nbleachers \u2013 seats arranged\non scaffolding like structures\nlooking down into the pit of\nthe stage. Monitor screens\nblink video footage high up\non the walls around the stage,\nand the occasional patrolling\nguards can be seen, while\nhuge caged walkways border\nthe edges of the room. The\nstaging is squalid, and at\ntimes claustrophobic, mirroring the disenfranchisement\nof the inmates; yet it crackles\nwith the energy the cast pro-duces. This is a performance\nto be experienced, not talked\nabout, from the bone shaking\nvibrations of the drums that\nare played onstage to signify\nbattle, to the rattling of the\nbars, to the explosive perfor-mances, it is all immersive. I\nemerged from the theatre a\nlittle shell shocked, wanting to\nwatch it all over again.

Trapped in\na life devoid of meaning,\nshe desires freedom and\npower, but is unable to seize\nit for herself. She is stifled\nand unfulfilled; the people\naround her bore her, from\nher insipid husband Tesman\nto his well-meaning aunts. It\nis her frustrated longing, her\nviolent individuality, that turns\ndestructive when caged. She\ndeliberately pushes her ex-lover Lovborg back over the\nedge into alcoholism, burns the\nonly copy of his manuscript,\nand encourages him to seek\na \u201cbeautiful\u201d death in suicide.\nWhere does all this take\nher? Nowhere, it seems.\nInstead of the \u201cdeed of\ndeliberate courage\u201d she\nsought, Lovborg dies a vulgar\ndeath in the bedchambers of\na prostitute. Hedda herself,\ndespite her thirst for freedom,\nis placed by incriminating evidence at the mercy of Judge\nBrack. Even her despised\nhusband Tesman deserts\nher. Backed into a corner, a\ndisillusioned Hedda attempts\none last act of beauty; taking\nher father\u2019s gun, she shoots\nherself through the temple.\nThis production at the\nNational Theatre is a contemporary Hedda Gabler by\nDutch director Ivo van Hove,\nknown for his avant-garde\ntheatrical productions. Even\nthe script gets an overhaul,\nwith a new version of Ibsen\u2019s\noriginal written by Patrick\nMarber. Marber\u2019s script\nremoves some of Ibsen\u2019s original subtlety \u2013 his Hedda is\nmore caustic, his Brack more\naggressive. This is a change,\nbut not a bad one; it shines\na starker light on Hedda\u2019s\nfoibles and struggles, both\ninternal and external. The\nmodern setting, for once,\nwas not out of place at all.\nPerhaps because Hedda \u2013 a\nlarge personality confined\nin too small a space \u2013 is not\na character who belongs\nonly to a single specific time\nperiod. If anything, ennui and\nexistential crises are more\nrelevant today than they were\nin the 19th\ncentury.\nThe set, designed by Jan\nVersweyveld, has a minimalist\nfeel. Sparsely scattered\nfurniture points to Tesman\u2019s\ninability to furnish the\nlavish lodgings that Hedda\ndemands. Their house is\ndominated by Hedda\u2019s piano\nin centre stage, and a modern\nClaire Chan\nvideo-intercom system that\nbuzzes shrilly every time\nsomeone enters the Tesmans\u2019\nhouse. Characters enter and\nleave through the actual\ndoors to the theatre rather\nthan slipping off into the\nwings. All except Hedda,\nthe only character for whom\nthere is no exit.\nRuth Wilson embodies\nHedda perfectly, capturing\nher melancholy, aspirations\nand trenchant wit. From\nJane Eyre in the 2006 BBC\nadaptation to Alison Lockhart\nin The Affair, Wilson has\nbeen celebrated for her sharp\nportrayals of intelligent, complex characters. Her Hedda\nis nonchalantly caustic, with\na dangerous charisma that\nbarely hides roiling undercurrents of bitterness and misery.\nAs Brack, the unscrupulous judge who harbours\ndesigns on Hedda, Rafe Spall\ndeserves special mention.\nHe starts off as an almost\ncharming friend of the Tesmans, the only one (aside\nfrom Lovborg) who seems to\nunderstand Hedda\u2019s inner\nthoughts and desires. He runs\na hand casually up Hedda\u2019s\nleg; he playfully offers himself\nfor a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. But his\nactions become steadily more\nmenacing as the play goes\non. In the third act he pins\nHedda to a wall; she laughs\nin his face because he has no\n\\\\ Ruth Wilson\nembodies Hedda\nperfectly, capturing\nher melancholy,\naspirations and\ntrenchant wit \\\\\nHedda Gabler is on at the\nLyttelton Theatre\nuntil the 21st of March, 2017\nTickets from \u00a315\nRuth Wilson as Hedda and Rafe Spall as Judge\nBrack \\\\\nJan Versweyveld\nhold over her.\nThe final act, when Brack\ndoes have Hedda in his\npower, is frightening and\nfraught with tension. Taking\na sip from a can of blood-like\nliquid, he spits it in Hedda\u2019s\nface and pours it on her\ndress, revelling in her inability\nto resist. He throws her to\nthe floor and towers over\nher apparently bloodstained\nfigure. It is a deeply disturbing scene of violence. Van\nHove is not called a controversial director for nothing; I\nexpect this move will divide\naudiences, though for me it\nseemed appropriate as the\nlast straw, the utter loss of\ncontrol that broke Hedda and\ndrove her to suicide.\nThe rest of the cast was\nvery good, though Chukwudi\nIwuji was rather too staid\nand scholarly as Lovborg. I\ncould not imagine him, like\nDionysus, \u201cwith vine leaves\nin his hair\", the embodiment\nof free-spirited courage that\nHedda saw him to be. Kyle\nSoller was an unusually likeable Tesman; I found it difficult\nto despise him as Hedda did.\nBut perhaps that was the\npoint.\nSome small details marred\nthe play a little for me; the\nhousekeeper Berte takes\non a strange importance\nin van Hove\u2019s production,\nwatching dispassionately\nin every scene but abruptly\nexulting with Hedda as she\nburns Lovborg\u2019s manuscript.\nWhat she is meant to signify\nremains a mystery to me.\nAlso, the audience has to sit\nthrough Toni Mitchell\u2019s Blue\nfour times, as an unnecessary\ncue for Hedda\u2019s melancholy\nintrospection. Wilson is more\nthan capable of portraying this without blatant\nsignposting.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t do such\nthings!\u201d exclaims Judge Brack\nat Hedda\u2019s dead body in the\nplay\u2019s famous closing line.\nFlying in the face of con-vention, van Hove\u2019s Hedda\nGabler is an fresh, compelling\nand poignant breath of air for\nIbsen\u2019s classic play.\nT\nhe Crucible' at Guildhall was my favourite show of the year. In the wake of everything that has\nhappened in 2016 it\u2019s quite difficult to be overly optimistic about the future but the Crucible\nreminded me of how mad people were in the 1950\u2019s, and we managed to get through that. Maybe\n- like the ice ages which come and go over millions of years - collective hysteria frosts and thaws in\nthe modern world over decades. We\u2019re in the middle of a snowstorm at the moment but soon the\nMacArthurs of our age will lose their way, and the Gorbachevs will be waiting with samovar in\nhand to guide us back into the sun.

But if pressed, I think I might choose Paul Nash\u2019s exhibition\nat the Tate Modern. Art is not something I am widely read in at all. Does that make\nappreciating it harder, or easier? At the very least, I can approach a work with a\ncompletely open and unbiased eye. Paul Nash\u2019s works, with their strange air of\notherworldliness, their suggestions of monumental power, stirred something in me. There are few\nhuman figures in his works, and those that exist are lost in the sheer vastness of his landscapes:\nthe infinite sky, an unending expanse of sea, his trees charged with symbolism. It is the idea of\nthe sublime that comes to the fore in his art.

You\u2019ve got used to having your freedom and privacy\nduring term time, and maybe even got used to having a bae that keeps the sexual frustration at bay. Maybe you\u2019ve got\nused to being able to use that corn-on-the-cob shaped vibrator that you got \u201cas a joke\u201d Secret Santa gift, but the thin walls\nin your parents\u2019 house mean that any buzzing will be extremely embarrassing. But don\u2019t worry. The illustrious felix Sex team\nhas you covered, and we want to make sure you\u2019re kept sexually satisfied over the holidays.\nChristmas tends to mean lots of food in the house, and that means plenty of excess fruit and veg that you can squirrel\naway to have your way with. Whether you\u2019re a top or a bottom, a giver or a receiver, we\u2019ve tested all the fruit and vegetables you might possibly want to use to scratch that itch, so you know what you\u2019re doing.\nBeing presented with a carrot, parsnip, courgette, banana, and\ncucumber and told to go and have fun is always a strange way to\nstart the week. Parsnips particularly, are a very unerotic vegetable,\nand I can\u2019t say that I was immediately excited to\nstick it up inside myself, even if \u2013 luckily \u2013 it was a\nparticularly fat one. But with an \u201cAlexa, dim the lights\nin the bedroom to 50 percent\u201d, the mood was set.\nParsnip\nThis seemed like it would be\nthe disappointing younger\nbrother to the carrot. Still\nfirm, very wide at one end,\nnarrow at the other - how\nwould this possibly match up\nto the consistent girth of the\ncarrot? But surprisingly, this\none was a winner. The shape\nand wide base made it very\neasily maneuverable which\ndefinitely paid off in spades.\nUnfortunately, it has a distinctive smell that was off-putting,\nand you can\u2019t snack on it\nafter.\nThere\u2019s definitely a lot more\nto be explored in the realm\nof wonky parsnips (thanks,\nJamie Oliver), and even the\nstraighter, skinny ones seem\nlike they could be put to good\nuse as a butt plug. Clearly a\ngood multipurpose vegetable.\nOverall a surprisingly 3.5/5\nCourgette\nCourgettes come in a variety of sizes and curvatures.\nI was presented with two of\nsimilar sizes: one curved, one\nstraight. Fucking a courgette made me nervous \u2013 it\ndoesn\u2019t feel sturdy enough to\nwithstand the action, although\nI was pleasantly surprised\nto find them perfectly intact\nonce I was done with them.\nThe straight courgette has\nno real advantages over\nthe carrot (unless you like\nthe sensation of flexing your\npelvic floor muscles against\nsomething that gives), but the\ncurvy courgette really outdid\nitself. If you get the angle\nright, that little courgette can\nhit that G-spot just the way\nGod intended.\nOverall a curvy 4/5\nBanana\nThanks to their use in sex\ned classes, bananas have a\nrelatively unsexy reputation.\nThanks to Brexit, the EU will\nstop dictating the straightness of our bananas, which\nmakes the whole thing overall\npositive, because a curvy\nbanana is a gift from the\nGods. They\u2019re way easier to\nposition than a courgette, and\nhave a convenient handle for\nease of use. But bananas are\ndefinitely a one time use only\nphallus. There\u2019s definitely a\nrisk of skin splitting if you\u2019re\nenthusiastic, so if you want\nto eat it afterwards, pop a\ncondom on it. It might be a\nbit mushy and warm, but that\npotassium makes it a perfect\nafter-sex snack.\nOverall remains a 4.5/5\nCucumber\nI went into this knowing that\ncucumbers are probably the\nmost fetishised vegetable for\nfucking. Unless you\u2019re a bit of\na size queen, a whole cucumber is a bit unnecessary. But,\nthere\u2019s no denying that it is a\nvery satisfying fruit to bang,\nand the size does make for an\neasy hands-free experience.\nA bit sturdier than a banana,\nwithout a strong smell, and\na fruit (not a vegetable) that\ncan be eaten for replenishing\nhydration afterwards \u2013 the\ncucumber lives up to the\nhype.\nOverall a cool 4/5\nFinal thoughts\nIf you\u2019re really that desperate, just about any of these vegetables will get the job done. The carrot would have always been\nmy go-to, but I was surprised by how much pleasure a well-cho-sen vegetable can deliver.\nCarrot\nI had high hopes for the\ncarrot. Firm, solid and\nstraight, a carrot is a pretty\npredictable makeshift dildo,\nand I think the one that\npeople are likely to have\ntried before \u2013 I know I have.\nMaybe I should spend more\nmoney on heating, but the\ncarrot started out pretty cold,\nwhich was definitely a mood\nkiller. Lesson 1: warm your\nvegetables gently before use\n(I used a hot water bottle).\nThe other problem was that\ncarrots have a surprisingly\nstrong, distinctive odour, and\ndefinitely leave some orange\nstaining (preventable if you\nstick a condom on it). However, with all of this aside, a\nnice big carrot definitely gets\nthe job done, and doesn\u2019t\nsuffer any damage in the pro-cess. Maybe don\u2019t slip it back\nin the vegetable crisper, but\nyou could definitely get away\nwith eating it as a midnight\nsnack.\nOverall a predictable 3/5\nTossing\nfruit salad\nPrincess Consuela Banana Hammock\nFinal thoughts\nI\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t say all melons were salvaged after their cherry popping (though if we only had\nthe piel de sapo to play with it wouldn\u2019t have survived to tell the story \u2013 would fuck again). Moral of the\nstory? If you\u2019re thinking of introducing a third person into a relationship maybe start with a piece of fruit.\nWhen the idea of this piece was first presented to\nme, I\u2019ll be honest, I thought it was a joke. But it all\nbecame very real when I was presented with a sack\nof melons to \u201cdo with as I please\u201d. So I took the melons home and tried to have my way with\nthem. My company for the night, let\u2019s call him domtop360, instead of protesting and saving us\nthe embarrassment of fucking fruit, was actually quite amused by the concept and decided to go\nalong with it. So we carved some appropriate sized holes and started mushing. For reference,\ndomtop360\u2019s mouth was 4 stars. Tutti Fruity\n| fleshlight edition\nGalia\nWe started off with one of the most intimidating-looking ones: the galia melon, all green and scaly, like a small innocent armadillo rolled\nup in a ball. After some encouragement, I stuck my penis in the hole we had carved out and after making some confused facial expressions\npassed the violated melon on to domtop360. The Galia was a bit rough. The seeds weren\u2019t particularly soft to the touch but hey, they weren\u2019t\nas sharp as we expected them to be either. We refrained from microwaving our sexual partners so they were refreshingly cool. Smell and\ntaste were great.\nOverall 1/5\nCantaloupe\nDefinitely one of the more stunning melons. Green and rough on the outside, a lot like the galia, its inside can be a beautiful deep orange,\nwhich can make it very appetising. So after the unimpressive galia, we were a bit more excited to try this one. At least I was. Domtop360\ndid express concerns. I believe his exact words were, \u201cI can see my dick bleeding\u201d. We found that if you like it a bit rough the cantaloupe\nmight be your kind of melon. Taste, smell and gooeyness were A-OK, but push too hard and it will get painful. Plus the seeds managed to get\neverywhere. Not foreskin friendly.\nOverall 0/5\nHoneydew\nSmoother looking and with a promising name we were also excited to taste this piece of fruit. Also the fact that it was bigger meant it would\nprobably actually accommodate an erect penis a bit better. Upon inspection we found that the honeydew was firmer, but its seeds were also\nharder and sharper. Also there was something about the smell that was really off-putting. And it was super juicy (which was both good and\nbad but which ultimately meant we\u2019d have to change the sheets).\nOverall 2/5\nPiel de Sapo\nSeeing this guy for the first time, the last thing that crosses your mind is, \u201cthat looks fuckable\u201d. It looks like a weird pumpkin crossed with an\namerican football. Domtop360 informed me that piel de sapo means skin of the toad \u2013 which was nice. On the plus side this at least looked\nlong enough to accommodate a penis. And it certainly was. Let me tell you ladies and gents, this melon is quite the treat; firm yet soft and\njuicy, sweet, fragrant with seeds that didn\u2019t get in the way. The piel de sapo was a delight and in fact allowed for some double penetration.\nDomtop360 even approved saying, \u201cI don\u2019t usually do threesomes but this is kinda hot\u201d.\nOverall 4 /5\nWatermelon\nOut of all the melons, the watermelon was the one I was most excited about. Perhaps it was memories of summer that fueled my lust.\nPerhaps it was that sexy red interior. Either way the watermelon beckoned to me and I excitedly answered. Alas, the experience was under-whelming. Surprisingly hard and unwelcoming, the watermelon\u2019s inside was not particularly pleasurable. A bit of thrusting was enough to\nmake it crack, to domtop360\u2019s delight: he took over and completed the watermelon cracking. Disappointing.\nOverall 1/5\n\n"

It\nis the archetypal \u201cmultidrug resistant (MDR)\npathogen\u201d, known for its\nextreme antibiotic resistance,\nbroad host range, and an\nassociation with serious\nillnesses including sepsis and\nhospital-acquired infections,\nprominent among which is\nthe life-threatening condition\ncystic fibrosis.\nKey to P. aeruginosa\u2019s\nnatural success is its ability\nto grow in complex microbial\ncommunities known as bio-films, in which bacterial cells\nare tightly adhered to each\nother in a sticky self-secreted\nmatrix. This matrix, containing\nprimarily proteins, polysaccharides and extracellular\nDNA, confers a high level\nof protection from chemical\nand physical stress and is\ncrucial in determining the\nrecalcitrance of P. aeruginosa\ninfections to drug treatment.\nIn this latest study, led by\nDianne Newman at the California Institute of Technology\n(Caltech) and published\nonline in the December 8\nissue of Science, the researchers took a new approach\nto impeding P. aeruginosa\nbiofilms. The group targeted\npyocyanin, a small blue\nmetabolite which has long\nbeen used in the diagnosis\nof P. aeruginosa infections,\nand which the group had\npreviously shown to underpin\nbiofilm formation.\nTo identify a factor that\nwould selectively degrade\npyocyanin, post-doctoral scientist Kyle Costa, first author\nof the study, turned to natural\nsoil-dwelling communities of\nbacteria in which P. aeruginosa exists side-by-side with\nother microbial species. Costa\nhypothesised that in order to\nthrive in a natural equilibrium\nwith P. aeruginosa, these\nother species must produce\nfactors which restrict P. aeruginosa growth.\nHence Costa collected\nsoil samples from in and\naround Caltech campus, from\nwhich he isolated another\nbacterium, Mycobacterium\nfortuitum, and identified the\npreviously uncharacterised\nmycobacterial protein, PodA\n(pyocyanin demethylase).\nPodA production by M.\nfortuitum is triggered by\nexposure to pyocyanin and is\nnecessary for its degradation,\nthe team showed.\nWhat\u2019s more, addition\nof PodA to P. aeruginosa\ncultures impeded biofilm\ndevelopment.\nWhilst the leveraging of\nmicrobial products to fight\ninfections is nothing new\n(thank you Al Fleming), these\nresults are novel in that they\ndemonstrate how degradation\nof a single small molecule that\npromotes the biofilm lifestyle\nis sufficient to obstruct biofilm\ngrowth.\nPyocyanin was previously\nshown to facilitate biofilm\nformation by two main routes:\nfirstly, by encouraging the\nrelease of extracellular DNA\nin early biofilms, and sec-ondly, by allowing cells at the\ncentre of the mature biofilm\nto survive in their oxygen-de-prived environment. PodA\nseems to act on both mecha-nisms, thereby restricting both\nnascent biofilm development\nand the further expansion of\nalready established biofilms.\nThe ubiquity of microbial\nbiofilms makes these findings\nrelevant in natural, clinical\nand industrial contexts, in\nwhich the ability to control\nbiofilm growth would be\nhighly desirable. In particu-lar, a number of important\nbacterial species, including\nErwinia and Burkholderia\n(plant and animal pathogens\nrespectively), are also known\nto produce pyocyanin-like\nmolecules.\n\u201c\u2026our results pave the way\nfor future studies to explore\nwhether the targeted manipulation of analogous molecules\nmade by different bacteria\nwill have similar effects on\nother microbial populations\u201d,\nsaid Costa.\nWhilst the prescription of a\nPodA inhaler may be several\nyears off yet, these findings\nonce again highlight just how\nmuch we stand to learn from\nmicrobial ingenuity, if we take\nthe time to look.\nF\nact: If you shuffle a\ndeck of cards, that\nprecise order of\ncards has probably\nnever happened\nbefore.\nActually, if every single\nperson on earth (all 7 billion\nof us) had shuffled one deck\nof cards every second since\nthe start of the universe \u2013\n13.7 billion years ago \u2013 we\nstill wouldn\u2019t even be close to\nhaving seen every possible\norder of cards.\nThe huge number of potential orders is the result of\nthe 52 cards in a deck. The\nnumber of possible combinations can be calculated using\na function called a \u2018factorial\u2019\n[written as \u2018!\u2019]. This multiplies\nthat number by every number\nsmaller than itself. For\nexample:\n10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6 x 5\nx 4 x 3 x 2 x 1\nNow imagine that for 52\nfactorial, and it\u2019s not hard\nto see that very quickly it\nbecomes a massively large\nnumber: 80,000,000,000,00\n0,000,000,000,000,000,00\n0,000,000,000,000,000,000\n,000,000,000,000,000,000\nto be precise (that\u2019s 67 zeros).\nAnd in the grand scheme of\nthings, that\u2019s nothing; if you\nreally want your mind blown,\nget someone to explain Graham\u2019s Number (the largest\nnumber ever even thought of)\nto you.\nPlay Your\nCards Right\nResearch from Caltech and the University of Oxford has identified a\nmycobacterial protein that inhibits biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\nthe major pathogen in cystic fibrosis\nAnother one of Mr. Aran\nShaunak\u2019s Little Bites of\nScience\nRachel Gillespie\n\\\\ Key to P. aeruginosa\u2019s natural success is its ability to\ngrow in complex microbial communities\nknown as biofilms \\\\\n\\\\ PodA restricts\nboth nascent biofilm\ndevelopment and\nthe further expansion of already established biofilms \\\\\nBiofilm de Kombucha \\\\ Charles de Mille-Isles\n\\\\ Wicker Paradise\n\n"

High\nexecutive pay has been thrust\ninto the headlines recently\namidst the furore of the BHS\ncollapse, and the harsh\nworking conditions discovered\nat Sports Direct. Whilst I am\nnot in favour of spending\nother people\u2019s pension money\non yachts (depending on who\nthe people are, and the size\nof the yacht), I am outraged\nthe Government\u2019s permission\nto pay its employees in the\nmanner it sees fit. Companies\nare owned by shareholders,\nand if they want to give lots\nof money to a particular\nindividual, why on earth\nshould they not be free to do\nso? What is different about a\ngroup of people handing over\nlarge sums of money and an\nindividual doing it? If Theresa\nMay made plans to force you\nto justify the price of your\ngirlfriend\u2019s birthday present,\nI doubt very much that the\nmeasure would be endorsed\nwith equal vigour, and as little\nthought, as her proposals on\nexecutive pay. If any person\nor group of people want to\npay someone several million\npounds a year, that is their\nright. It is not up to anyone\nelse to decide what someone\nis paid, except those paying\nthe wages. Furthermore,\nno justification whatsoever\nshould be required if a\ncompany wishes to pay one\nindividual 140 times more\nthan another. If they pay\ntheir workers above minimum\nwage and pay tax then the\ncompany\u2019s activities can only\nbe good for the economy\nand the country, and no law\nhas been broken that justifies\nimpeding on their freedom.\nThe entire shareholder/board\nof directors system exists to\nensure that the people who\nown the company make the\nimportant decisions, and there\nis no reasonable excuse for\nthis charge to be transferred\nto an outside governing body.\nAside from the intrusion on\nfundamental freedoms, the\nissue of executive pay is poorly\nportrayed and represented.\nWhilst the average worker\nmay be paid far less than\nthe average executive, that is\nbecause their job is (often) far\neasier and requires less skill,\npushing down wages as more\npeople are included in the\npool of possible employees.\njustify paying him or her \u00a35\nmillion a year? Imagine a\nscenario where you, a young\nentrepreneur who has started\nyour own company, require\na babysitter so that you can\nwork nights to improve the\nsuccess of your initiative. If you\ndo extremely well, and are\npaid handsomely accordingly,\nit would be ridiculous for your\nbabysitter to demand that he\nor she be paid more in line\nwith what you earned. Yes,\nyou couldn\u2019t have done it\nwithout them, but you could\neasily have found another\nimpoverished student to do\nthe babysitting for you. You\npaid them for the work they\ndid, and the fact that they may\nhave been involved at some\nlevel in the profits of your\nlabour does not grant them\nright to demand increased\ncompensation.\nI agree that if a company\nhas done well, workers should\nbe included in that success. To\nmake that the law, however,\nis an indefensible intrusion\non basic freedoms. If the\ngovernment feels workers\nare underpaid, they should\nraise the minimum wage\naccordingly. Removing\nfreedom should always\nbe an absolute last resort,\nparticularlywhenthefreedoms\nin question can add value\nto this country\u2019s economy. I\nappreciate that the ownership\nExecutives, on the other hand,\nare often highly qualified, and\nare working on much more\nskilled tasks and facing higher\ndemands from shareholders.\nIn addition, the value created\nby each individual worker is\nfar less than that created by\nan individual executive \u2013 why\nshould that created value not\nbe rewarded fairly? If my\ncompany generates \u00a3100\nmillion profit a year, and\nmy brilliant chief executive\nis responsible for most of\nthat, why on earth need I\nat the suggestion that the\nGovernment has the right to\ndetermine what a company\npays its staff.\nThis country is founded on\nsome key tenets, the most basic\nof which is the fundamental\nfreedom to make your own\ndecisions, provided you abide\nby the law. In that regard then\nit seems absurd to suggest that\na company must, in effect, ask\nissues surrounding BHS have\nleft a \u00a3571 million hole in\nthe pension pot, and that has\nreal impacts for employees;\nhowever, unless the law was\nbroken, then only the good\nconscience of those involved\ncan (and should) resolve\nthe matter. Individual cases\ncannot dictate government\npolicy, especially when those\nregulations are simply populist\nin nature and deny basic rights\nand freedoms.\nAll in all, although one may\nnot agree with the disparate\nremuneration levels of\nworkers and executives, the\nright of a company to pay its\nstaff how it likes (within the\nlimits of the minimum wage)\nremains theirs. Theresa May,\nand many of her political\npeers, seem to see executive\npay as another bone to toss\nto the disgruntled public in\nreturn for favour. I hope, for\nthe sake of your right to buy\nyour girlfriend a ridiculously\nexpensive birthday present,\nthat her attitudes will never be\nenacted into legislation.\n\\\\ Furthermore,\nno justification\nwhatsoever should\nbe required if a\ncompany wishes to\npay one individual\n140 times more than\nanother \\\\\n\n"
