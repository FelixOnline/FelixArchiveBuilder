    "content": "Feature Felix 933 8 May 1992\nOne's first impressions of Tokyo\ncan be quite shocking - mile after\nmile of concrete buildings,\npunctuated by spiders' webs of\ntelegraph poles and electricity\ncables. It was 7.30pm and yet the\ncountless office blocks were still\nfull of people beavering away.\nClearly, the western perception of\nthe Japanese being workaholics\nmust have had some truth to it. The\nunbearably high level of humidity\nhits you like a brick wall the\nmoment you set foot outside. It\ntakes quite a while to get\naccustomed to, but there really is no\nchoice.\nwas to give us a feel for the daily\nroutine of the average Japanese\nworker. This meant waking up\nextra early, trekking under the\nburning sun to the train station and\nlater join a long queue for the\nNissan bus. Not knowing the way\nwas not a problem - you simply had\nto follow the crowds - most of them\nwere Nissan employees anyway!\nA great many workshops were\norganised for us, most of them in\nEnglish. The language barrier is\nprobably the greatest difficulty for\na foreigner in Japan, though I was\nquite fortunate in that I had taken\nthe 2-year Japanese course as the\nThe Nail that Sticks Out\nRony Douek\nwent to Japan to\nstudy how a multinational\ncorporation\nrelates to its\nworkforce and\nsaw how the\nJapanese live\nLast year the Japanese car\nmanufacturer Nissan organised an\nessay competition which enabled\nmyself and 15 other students to\nattend the 'Nissan Summer Seminar\n1991'. The stated aim of this three\nweek seminar was 'to offer students\nthe opportunity to understand\nNissan's corporate philosophy and\nJapanese culture by experiencing\nNissan's process of automobile\ndevelopment in Japan.'\nNissan Motor Co. Ltd,\nestablished in 1933, pioneered the\nmanufacture of automobiles in\nJapan and today it is the fourth\nlargest automobile manufacturer in\nthe world. The company has its\nHead Office in Tokyo, with seven\nmanufacturing plants principally in\nthe greater Tokyo-Yokohama area.\nOverseas assembly and\nmanufacturing plants are located at\n24 sites in 21 different countries,\nwith major operations in the USA, the UK, Mexico and Australia.\nNissan's main Research and\nDevelopment centre is located in a picturesque country setting, just\noutside Tokyo. The environment is\nvery relaxed and tries to breed\ninspiration and a feeling of\ntogetherness within the workforce.\nThis was to be our base for the next\n3 weeks.\nOne of the aims of the seminar\nlanguage option during my first\ndegree. Those who had no prior\nknowledge of the language found it\nhard to communicate. Quite\nunexpectedly, the Japanese proved\nto be very poor at speaking English.\nThey tend to be embarrassed when\nmaking mistakes, and I often found\nit easier to communicate by writing\nnotes on paper.\nThere is very strong pressure to\nconform in Japanese society, a tendency which is well illustrated by\nan old Japanese saying 'the nail that\nsticks out gets hammered down'.\nOne of the workshops involved a round table discussion with some\nyoung Nissan engineers. We tried\nto see whether there was any truth\nto a number of stereotyped western\nviews of the Japanese employment\nsystem and it was interesting to note\nthat before answering some of our\nmore direct questions, such as\n'would you have preferred\nemployment with the more\nprestigious Toyota?' the\nembarrassed engineer would stare\nat the others in the room so as to\nensure that his answer was met with\ngeneral approval. Japanese\nworkers, we discovered, do indeed\nwork very long hours and feel quite\nhappy doing so. since it shows\ncommitment towards the job and the\ncompany but they do not dislike\nholidays, as we are led to believe.\nAt Nissan there is a standard work\nuniform, but people are free to\nchoose whether or not to wear it.\nContrary to popular myth, the\nworking day does not start with a group gymnastics session - and\nthough there are companies in\nwhich this is done, it is certainly not\nthe rule.\nThe western habit of changing\njobs still raises eyebrows in Japan.\nThe Japanese feel honoured that the\ncompany condescends to employ\nthem, and expect to remain with\ntheir first employers until the\nmandatory retirement age. Moving\ncompany for any reason is still\nviewed with suspicion, and is often\ntaken to imply that there is\nsomething wrong with the person\nrather than the company.\nWomen engineers are a rarity in\nJapan. On the line management\nlevel, we were told that one in every\n5000 workers was a woman but we\nwere assured that there is currently\na drive to encourage more women\nto join the firm. I personally feel\nthink this may take quite some time.\nWomen are expected to get married\nwhen in their 20s, sometimes by an\narranged marriage to another\ncompany employee, and so\neventually become a good\nhousewife who takes care of the\nchildren. Indeed, women who are\nstill single at the age of 30 are\ndescribed as 'Christmas Cake', ie\ncake which is not eaten once\nChristmas is over.\nThe main cultural part of the\nseminar was a three day trip to the\ntemples and shrines of the city of\nKyoto. Kyoto is a fair distance from\nTokyo, though this was hardly\n\u2014 1 0 \u2014\n8 May 1992 Felix 933 Feature\nnoticeable when travelling by\nShinkansen, the famous Bullet\nTrain. You have to be extremely\nquick when boarding the train as the\ndoors remain open for precisely 20\nseconds and no delay is tolerated.\nKyoto has some of the finest shrines\nin Japan. Before stepping into any\ntemple or shrine you are obliged to\nremove your shoes - it is therefore\nimportant to ensure that your socks\nare not holed or you could be in for\nan embarrassing time. Our stay in\nKyoto was made as typically\nJapanese as possible - this meant\nstaying in an inn where the rooms\nwere surrounded; by sliding.paper\ndoors and food was served on small\ntables by ladies dressed in kimonos,\nwhilst we sat crass legged on\ncushions. Together with the usual\nmenu of fish, seafood and tofu\n(bean curd) in miso soup, there was\nalways some sake. At the end of the\nfirst evening, after having had a slight overdose of sake, we headed\nfor the city centre dressed in\nyukata s( Japanese gowns) and\nwearing geta (wooden sandals),\nbehaving terribly like loud gai j in s( foreigners)!\nThe closest I got to seeing how\nthe average Japanese family lives\nwas when I spent a weekend with\nthe family of a Nissan worker, this\nparticular family did not speak a word of English and I was the first\nforeigner they had ever met. They\nlived in a relatively large house\ntogether with the rest of their\nextended family, not too far away\nfrom the Nissan plant. The house\nwas built in western style except for\none faf ami style room which was\nsurrounded by sliding paper doors\nand furnished with traditional items\nmm\nsuch as an ikebana (flower\narrangement) and a couple of\nhanging wall paintings. The main\nentrance was neatly arranged with\nmany bonsai trees. On entering\nJapanese homes you usually put on\na pair of pale brown slippers. Extra\nslippers are provided for the use of\nguests - these are invariably too\nsmall for' foreigners. The slippers\ncan be used in all of the house\nexcept the toilet, and before going\nto the toilet there is another change\nof slippers, this time into even tinier\nbright red ones. Like most\nforeigners, I often forgot to change\nback into the pale brown ones on the\nway out and was often looked upon\nin horror for doing so. When I asked them what religion they\npractised they replied that they were\nBuddhists, Shintoists and\nChristians. Statistics state that in\nJapan there are 101 million\nShintoists, 82 million Buddhists and\n1.1 million Christians - a total of\n1.5 times Japan's population. The\nJapanese feel no contradiction in\nholding a wedding ceremony before\nthe deities of Shinto and a funeral\nwomen who are\nstill single at 30\nare called\n'Christmas\nCake' - ie cake\nnot eaten after\nChristmas\nservice in front of the Buddha.\nThere are also many Japanese who\nobserve Christmas.\nMy home stay family were\nextremely kind and friendly -courtesy is most certainly a way of\nlife in Japan. I was taken to visit all\nthe tourist spots and I had a strictly\nfish and seafood based menu,\nincluding breakfast with mussel\nsoup, fried shrimps and the\nomnipresent bowl of white rice.\nTokyo is quite an immense city\n- one is stunned by the sheer\nnumber of people in it. This\nbecomes particularly noticeable at\nthe railway station during rush hour\nwhere it is difficult to avoid the\nstampede of people moving in and\nout of trains. At several stations\nthere are special people called\n'pushers' whose job it is to push\ncommuters onto crowded trains to\nensure the doors shut properly.\nOne curious and popular Japanese\nhabit is an arcade game called\npa chink o. Almost every\nneighbourhood will have one\npa chink o parlour and sometimes\nthere are more than one on the same\nroad. In essence, the game is\nvertical pinball where the metal\nballs are aimed at targets, and if\nsuccessful, the numbers of balls\nincreases. It is quite a sight\nwatching scores of people from\nevery age group and profession\nsitting side by side playing this\ngame endlessly. Since gambling is\nillegal in Japan, the prizes obtained\nin exchange for your bucket of\nmetal balls take the form of such\nitems as tinned fruit. This is a neat\nway of sidestepping the rules as\nwhen you have had enough you can\ncross the road and sell your tins for\nmoney at a strategically located\nstreet stall.\nSunday on a Tokyo beach was a memorable experience. When we\narrived there was hardly any place\nfor us to lay our towels and,\nsurprisingly, even though the sea\nwas visibly dirty it was absolutely\npacked with people. Swimming\nmeant that you had to struggle\nthrough the crowds and avoid being\nhit by swimmers who were thrown\noff course by the massive waves.\nThe dark silhouette of Mt Fuji could\nbe seen in the distance and as the\nevening drew closer, the sunset\nreached a striking intensity of\nbeauty.\nMy stay in Japan probably ranks\nas the most enjoyable vacation I have ever spent. If I was to write\na more comprehensive article on\nmy experiences I am sure that it\nwould require more space than\nFelix could afford. I strongly\nrecommend anybody with some\ninterest in Japan to take advantage\nof the two year Humanities course\nin Japanese and get to learn about\na culture that has far more to offer\nthan mere Sony Walkmans and\nKaraoke bars.\n\u2022 Anybody interested in the next\nseminar should contact The\nGraduate Controller, Nissan\nEuropean Technology Centre Ltd.\nCranfield Technology Park, Mulsoe\nRd, Cranfield, Bedfordshire, MK40D B... before going\nto the toilet\nthere is another\nchange of\nslippers, this\ntime into even\ntinier bright red\nones.\n- 1 1 -\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 933 8 May 1992\nThe Truth About St Mary's Dear Editor,\nI fear that Ms Mountford's letter\nof 18th March was written from a position of ignorance, and I can\ntherefore not criticise her for\nmaking so many factual errors.\nHowever, I do feel that it is\nimportant for someone who has at\nleast some knowledge of the\nsituation surrounding the merger to\nput the record straight.\nIt is right that we are aCC U of\nIC Union. However, it is not upon\nthe same terms as the other CCUs.\nWe have financial and political\nautonomy\u2014we do not have to apply\nto UFC for money to fund our 45\nclubs, and nor do we have to adopt\npolicy that is passed at aUG M. The\nreasons for this autonomy are\ncomplex. The timing and location\nof UGM's make attendance at them\nimpossible for any Mary's student,\nas was discussed in detail three\nyears ago (when, I suspect, Ms\nMountford was taking her\nGCSE's), when there was a move\nto abolish UGMs since they were\ndeemed to be undemocratic, as it\nwas impossible for 500 of IC\nUnion's members (the Mary's students) to attend. This move was,\nsadly, defeated by the regime of\nNigel Baker (a name that few may\nremember, but that even fewer\nmight want to remember!). All of\nthe efforts which have ensued since\nthen have not been to drive a wedge\nbetween ICU and SMHMS SU, but\nrather, to open pathways of\ncommunication, so that those who\nwish to interact from each side of\nthe park are able to, but that nothing\nis forced. It was originally assumed\nby ICU that we would enter on the\nsame terms as the other CCUs. We\nmade sure that this was not to be the\ncase\u2014by losing separate finance\nand policy making, St Mary's would lose its autonomy, and all\nthat is special to the institution. The\nwise people of ICU Exec who\nfollowed the Baker regime\nrecognised that it is far better to\ncreate the opportunity for\ninteraction, rather than taking away\nwhat we had and forcing us to the\nterms of ICU. And, since we signed\nthe merger document in 1990, the\npartnership has grown\u2014and that is\nan extremely healthy thing to occur.\nICU and SM HMS SU have taken\nan interest in each other, helping\neach other out (both ICU helping\nus, and at least when I was on St\nMary's Union, us helping ICU) and\nforging friendships, which is what\nthe merger should all be about.\nHence, when I see a letter like Ms\nMountford's, it makes my blood\nboil\u2014to make a statement such as\n'without IC Union, St Mary's would not exist' is not only\nludicrous and downright untrue, but\nit just goes to promote the 'and IC\nfeeling' which initially existed at St\nMary's and which, over recent\nyears, has tended to die. The\nreasons for the merger are\nextremely complex, and I would not\npresume to try to explain them.\nHowever, to suggest that IC 'saved'\nSt Mary's from being thrown on the\nscrap heap is, I suspect, only a partial truth, if at all. The survival\nof St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool depends, primarily, on the\nexistence of St Mary's Hospital,\nand its satellite hospitals, and the\nmaintenance of enough patients to\nteach 300 clinical students. IC has\nno control, whatsoever, over St\nMary's Hospital, and I am sure that\nthe first London Medical School\nthat is cut will be one that is\nconnected to a hospital which is\nshort of patients. Suggesting that\nMary's would have died if IC\nhadn't rushed to save us is, I suspect, untrue.\nSo why did I ask the question\nabout Ben Turner, complaining that\nthe candidates took no interest in\nMary's. Those candidates will be\nrepresenting the views of IC\nstudents, including 500 medical\nstudents, to many University and\nCollege Committees which St\nMary's do not have representation\non. For example, upon the merger,\nwe lost our representation on\nSenate, and we are now represented\nby a member of ICU. How can they\nexpect to represent the views of IC\nas a whole if they have completely\nignored 500 of the students which\nthey represent. Similarly, St Mary's has no representative on Governing\nBody, so how can someone who has\nnever even been to St Mary's hope\nto say what our opinion on a matter\nmight be. I would agree that some\nof the candidates were given a grilling\u2014I bele ive that a hustings is\nmeant to push the candidates, and\nif they couldn't stand up to the\nquestioning that I gave them, I do\nnot want them representing me.\nAs someone who was involved in\nmany of the intricate discussions\nsurrounding the merger, who\nhelped to write the merger\ndocument, and who played a very\nmajor part in the year following the\nmerger, I feel that I have the right\nto grill the candidates, and to find\nout what their plans for IC and\nMary's are. I also have the right to\nbe upset that the candidates know\nlittle, and seemed to care less, about\nthe 500 students that they wished to\nrepresent.\nThe elections made me sad, as\nhas Ms Mountford's letter. It is\nvery difficult to take steps forwards\nin the partnership between IC and\nMary's, and extremely easy to take\nsteps backward. I fear that the\nelections and the correspondence\nhave done little to move forwards,\nand probably a great deal to move\nback. I hope that both ICU and\nSMHMS SU will continue moving\nforwards, creating opportunities for\ninteraction, and creating\nfriendships. I wish them both\nluck\u2014we are in this merger\ntogether, let's not start the fighting\nagain, but move forwards arm in\narm!\nSimon GT Smith,\nEx President SMHMS SU\n(90/91). Ex Vice President ICU\n(90/91), 5th Year Medical Student.\nThe Truth About the Union Bar\n\u2022 Did you know that the Union Bar's full name\nDear Adam,\nOn Friday 06 March, IC Radio\nbroadcast a story about the\nresignation of Ramesh Patel from\nthe Union Bar and Ramesh's replacement by Gervaise Loraine,\nfondly known as Jarv.\nMy radar like hearing items tell\nme that some union bod s are\nbitching about this story. This story\nyou know well - it was printed in\nthe / CNN Spring News Review.\nFor those of short memory, or no\nreference files, I append the\ntranscript of the ICR story -Gervaise Loraine, better known\nas Jarv, has won the position of\nassistant bar manager after Ramesh\nPatel resigned his post earlier this\nyear. Mr Loraine was appointed\nabove 70 other people after the post\nwas advertised in the national\nmedia. This now leaves the post of\nbar steward wide open, and the cost\nof advertising another post in the\nunion bar has yet to be mentioned\nby sabbaticals, one of whom said,\n'Jarv was far and away the best\ncandidate for the post.' This claim\nhas been widely rejected by students\nand staff in the students' union, who\nappear to be upset that Mr Loraine\nhas been appointed. It has been\nreported that Mr Patel resigned\nafter being forced to by in-fighting.\nAs union staff have no right to\nspeak under a student union staff\nprotocol, they were unable to\ncomment.\nNow, whilst I know that some\nunion people are complaining, I don't know what they are\ncomplaining about. Why? Simplethey haven't bothered to tell me. As\nper usual, they have relied on the\nwhispering winds to convey\ninformation downstairs. (Let me be\nhelpful: Felix - phone 3515, 8672;\nIC Radio - phone 8710; STOIC3518).\nOn this basis, I have been left to\nguess as to the offending passage.\nMy dog Watson tells me that it is\nas follows:\nThis claim has been widely\nrejected by students and staff in the\nstudents' union who appear to be\nupset that Mr. Loraine has been\nappointed.\nAt the time we broadcast this\nreport, this was true and accurate,\nas it was based on the only\ninformation that was to hand. Also,\nthis part of the story 'broke', or\nbecame public, on a Friday\nevening.\nThis left two choices; broadcast\nand be damned, or hold it and then\ncheck. At the time, it looked good,\nand the source seemed solid. So we\nbroadcast.\nWe were wrong, we got it wrong,\nthe story was wrong. After\nchecking, we could not verify our\ninterpretation of this phrase.\nTherefore, we withdraw the phrase,\nwith all appropriate regret and\napologies to Ramesh, and to Jarv.\nStrangely enough, we still have\nnot received any complaint from the\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

It's exhausting but it has to\nbe done. In recent years many\nEuropean veterans have found\nthere's an even more exciting\nfrontier to conquer before settling\ndown to a life of chartered\naccountancy.\nDuring the 19th Century the USA\nwas opened up by its pioneer\nrailroads, and trains still sound a long, mournful horn as they round\nthe bend at midnight. This may not\nbe the fastest way to travel but it\ngives you plenty of time to relax,\nmeet new people and broaden your\nhorizons. Americans generally like\nto talk and on trains they'll tell you\ntheir life story in hair-raising detail.\nI 've travelled more than 50,000\nmiles by train throughout North\nAmerica and found it easily the\nmost comfortable and trouble-free\nway to see the country. Many\nplaces visited by train can't be\nvisited any other way, and\nschedules are arranged so that you\npass through the best scenery by\nday. Long-distance trains have\nsleek, double-decked coaches with\nlarge-windowed lounge and\nobservation cars. You get a smooth\nride, lots of space and exuberant\npersonnel who think they're\nauditioning for a1930s movie.\nDining car meals are good value,\nor you can bring your own food on\nboard.\nAnother way to eco no mise is to\nspend as many nights on board as\npossible, arriving at your\ndestination early in the morning\nready for a day's sightseeing.\nGetting a good night's sleep is\nsurprisingly easy, given the big\nreclining seats and a free pillow\nfrom the attendant. You should take\na blanket or coat with you, though,\nbecause the air conditioning is\nsometimes over-enthusiastic. Most\nover-night trains also incorporate\ndesignated sleeping cars, but the\nbedrooms are small and you have\nto pay extra.\nIn 1971, the federal government\nset up Amtrak to take over rail\npassenger services, which had\nalmost been written off thanks to the\nairlines and automobile culture. The\nlast twenty years has seen a transformation, with new routes\nopened up and more people\nrediscovering the pleasures of rail\ntravel. Among Amtrak's refurbished stations is a wonderfully\nornate building in Washington DC,\nwhere dozens of shops and\nrestuarants augment the multi-screen cinema. Chicago's Union\nstation boasts a marble and brass\nwaiting room the size of a cathedral\n(as seen in Brian de Palma's 'The\nUntouchables').\nBesides being romantic and\necologically sound, US trains are\none of the World's great travel\nbargains. A forty-five day\nNationwide Pass offers more than\n500 destinations in 46 states for\nabout \u00a3 4 a day - that's$299( \u00a3167)\nin low season and $349 in high\nseason (mid-May to mid-September). With a Far Western\nPass you can travel in all the Pacific\nStates as well as across the Rocky\nMountains to Colorado, Montana\nand New Mexico for $189 (\u00a3110).\nOther 45-day passes cover the\nEastern USA, the West and Florida\n(only \u00a339).\nOne of the most spectacular trains\nyou can ride is the Coast Starlight,\nrunning between Seattle, near the\nCanadian border, and Los Angeles.\nCalifornia. As well as bri lian t green\nforests and 10,000 foot mountains,\nyou will see Puget Sound and many\nmiles of Pacific beaches, where you\nmight be lucky enough to spot\nmigrating whales off shore. San\nFrancisco is a fast bus ride across\nthe bay from Oakland.\nOther recommended trains\ninclude the Southwest Chief (taking\nin the Grand Canyon), the Crescent\n(New York to New Orleans via the\ndeep South) and the Maple Leaf (for\nNiagara Falls and Toronto in\nCanada). The Desert Wind goes to\nChicago from Los Angeles via the\nRocky Mountains and Las Vegas,\nwhere the station is actually inside\nthe Union Plaza Hotel. You step\ndirectly from the train into an\ninferno of slot machines and\ngamblers.\nIt is not possible to travel coast\nto coast on a single train, but there\nare several ways of crossing the\ncountry which involve just one\nchange. You could leave New York\non the Lake Shore Limited, for\nexample and travel beside the\nHudson River (views of Sing Sing\nJail and West Point) to Albany, then\nfollow the Erie Canal to Lake Erie\nand Cleveland. At Chicago you\nhave an hour or so wait before\nboarding the Empire Builder, which\naccompanies the Mississippi and\nMissouri rivers through farmland\nbefore crossing 700 miles of North\nDakota and Montana plains. The\nsnow covered Rocky Mountains are\ncrossed via Glacier National Park\nbefore your journey ends in Seattle.\nThis trip takes about 2'A days in\nall. Other trans-continental routes\ncan easily be worked out with the\naid of the free timetable guide, but\nnote that in some cities Amtrak uses\nmore than one station.

    "content": "8 May 1992 Felix 933 Feature\nTalking About\nProblems\nDon Adlington, Student Counsellor.\nIn some respects it seems a little\nodd that University Students, of all\npeople, should be thought to need\na range of support services which\nare more comprehensive, better\nstaffed and more accessible than\nthose available to their peer group\noutside. Virtually all universities\nhave an extensive medical service,\nstaffed by doctors and nurses who\nput a high value on talking to their\npatients\u2014hardly an image of\ngeneral practice which would be\nrecognisable to the consumers of\nNational Health Service medicine in\nthe country at large. Most\nuniversities have well staffed\nstudent services units where\npractical advice and help are\navailable on demand, and where\nstudents can expect assistance and\nsometimes advocacy in their\ndealings with bureaucracy. Most\nuniversities, including this one,\nhave appointed Counsellors whose\nbrief, in essence, is an open-ended\ncommitment to helping students\nwith personal problems. Again the\ncontrast with the world outside\nacademia is very great. How can we\njustify this inevitable allocation of\nscarce resources in favour of the\nmost articulate, intelligent, and able\nsector of the school leaving\npopulation?\neven a short\nperiod of stress\ncan have a disproportionate\neffect\nAnother way of phrasing the\nquestion perhaps, is this\u2014What is\nso special about University\nstudents? There are two sorts of\nanswers I believe. The most\ntendentious and value laden one\ninvolves the economic argument\nthat University entrants are\nthemselves scarce resources and\nthat as an advanced technology\nbased society we are fully justified,\neven obliged, to afford them extra\nsupport and protection. This view,\n(of high educational provision\ngenerally) is enthusiastically\nembraced by the middle classes,\nand is compliant ly tolerated by the\nworking classes. The other sort of\nanswer, and the one I am most\ninterested in. concerns the peculiar\nnature of a student's occupation,\nthat is. sustained, systematic and\nhigh level learning, and the\ninteraction between the learning\nprocess and anxiety, distress and\nother emotional disturbances. I do\nnot believe that on the whole the\ncontingent life problems that\nstudents have to cope with are\nsignificantly different to those of the\nrest of their age group\u2014indeed it\ncan reasonably be supposed that\nthey will not. on average, be as bad.\nTo be sure there are some\noccupational hazards which are\nas so ica ted with the intellectual high\nflyer, for example academic\nexcellence may have been attained\npartly at the cost of the neglect of\nother sorts of skills, particularly\nsocial skills, and it may be true also\nthat some kinds of stress,\ninseparable from university study\nare not risks to which non students\nare exposed.\nThe residual, but solid,\njustification for professional helping\nservices in universities is the degree\nto which the students' central\nactivity\u2014study\u2014is impaired by\nfactors which would be far less\ndisabling in terms of efficiency for\nanother person whose occupation\nwas serving in a shop, digging holes\nin the road or working behind a bank counter. A bereavement, a broken love relationship, or a parental divorce, is equally\ntraumatic for everyone, and the\nimmediate emotional impact is\nprecisely the same. For the\nuniversity student however, and\nparticularly perhaps for students at\nColleges like this, where the work\nis cumulative and sequential, even\na relatively short period of distress\nrelated inefficiency can have a quite\ndisproportionate effect.\nOther common, but less obvious\nsources of distress and anxiety may\nalso undermine the capacity to study\nin a highly insidious way.\nFor example, the student who\nfinds it difficult to make friends, or\nwho feels in other ways out of step\nwith what he perceives as normal,\nmay find some of the more\nmechanical tasks associated with his\nwork quite easy to cope with, but\nfind it virtually impossible to sit and\nconcentrate on work that requires\nabstract thinking. T can't concentrate\": 'my mind wanders off\nonto other things'; I spend hours\njust looking at my notes, taking\nnothing in'; are phrases which are\nvery familiar to those whose job it\nis to help students.\nThe individual colouring of this\nsort of study problem can be\ninfinitely varied, but in practise\nthere are some well recognised\npatterns into which most people fit\nquite easily. Besides the sorts of\nproblems already mentioned\u2014the\nfracture of threat to key\nrelationships, and the difficulties\nengendered by isolation and the\nfears associated with it\u2014I have in\nmind such problems as anxieties\nabout one's choice of course, and\npossibly about the next move in life,\nnow that all the more or less\nprescribed ones are at an end.\nCoping with the competitiveness in\nacademic work and learning to\nrecognise the appropriateness or\notherwise of the level of degree one\nhopes to achieve. Coping with the\nemotional demands of other\nstudents and friends and finding\nsome sort of formula for dealing\nwith the more negative aspects of\nhuman behaviour. There are also\nthe mundane worries about money\nand accommodation, about the\nplanning of one's time and the need\nto recognise that time and energy\nare finite resources and that\ninvidious choices have to be made.\nThere is no doubt that for all these\nsorts of difficulty, and many others,\nthere is much to be said for talking\nto someone about them. People\ngenerally, but scientists and\ntechnologists in particular perhaps,\ntend to underestimate the simple\nvalue of talking. Many of us, at\ntimes of difficulty almost\nautomatically turn in on\nourselves\u2014partly out of pride (the\npowerful impulse to keep up an\nappearance of competence), and\npartly out of the inappropriate\nrational argument that talking\ncannot change hard reality, cannot\nalter the substantive roots of our\nunhappiness. cannot alter 'the\nfacts'.\nTalking is important and effective\nhowever in a number of ways.\nFirstly it enables people to express,\nand therefore to ventilate their\n(often angry) feelings. Providing\nthis is done in the right sort of\nsetting, and with the right sort of\nresponse, it helps to liberate the\nenergy required to tackle real life\ndifficulties constructively. Secondly\nit is often only by talking about\nthings that we are able to sort out\none strand from another and make\nsome sort of coherent picture of the\nsituation. Thirdly, this more or less\nconscious sharing of feelings may\nvery well lead to new ideas, new\ninformation, new initiatives for\ntackling problems.\nThere are many people in College\nto whom students can talk\u2014their\ncolleagues and friends of course,\nbut also College staff, tutors,\ndoctors, student services staff. You\ncan also talk to me. I am not paid\nto do anything else, and my work\nis entirely confidential. If you\nwould like to see me, my office is\nat 15 Princes Gardens, and my\ntelephone number is 3041.\n9\n\n"

    "content": "8 May 1992 Felix 933 Felix\nOne of the chief problems of\nmodern reform is to improve the\nconditions under which people now\nlive; yet, to improve the qualities\nof the generations of the future is\nsurely a problem of equal, if not of\nsurpassing importance. The study\nof this problem is called Eugenics.\nIt is not, as many suppose, a scheme for marrying prize-fighters\nYet. though the harm due to\nshort-sighted legislation, misplaced\ncharity and other causes is evident,\nprogress has been made in other\ndirections. Better education, better\nhousing, cheaper food, increased\nfacilities for travelling, shorter\nhours of work and higher wages\u2014\nthese things have all helped to\nimprove the condition of the people;\na great result may be achieved.\nNevertheless, to effect this result\nis no easy matter. Where there is\nno will, there is no way. How, then,\nis it possible to raise ourselves\nabove our present level? Direct\nlegislation, such as prevention or\nrestriction of certain marriages, is\nat the present time impossible, even\nif it could ever be resorted to. Such\nOriginally\npublished in\nPhoenix,\nNovember 1923.\nThe Selfish Geneticist\nto robust dairy maids or professors\nto schoolmistresses; nor is it in any\nsense a class movement. Its aim is\na broad one\u2014to promote the good\nof the community as a whole by\nencouraging the desirable and by\ndiscouraging the undesirable. The\naim of Eugenics is to encourage the\nhealthy, thoughtful hardworking\nand thrifty, and at the same time to\ndiscourage the diseased, feckless,\nindolent and thrift less \u2014or at any\nrate to discourage them from\nreproducing their kind.\nUnfortunately, the effect of\nmodern legislation is often to\nreverse the process. Imbeciles and\nother degenerates are kept alive in\nan artificial manner, and habitual\nidlers are encouraged by the\ncareless distribution of doles,\nwhereas the thrifty and industrious\nare well-nigh crushed out of\nexistence under the burden of\ntaxation. A thoughtful working man\ndoes not have a family larger than\nhe is reasonably able to support;\nbut, the un conscientious are\ninfluenced by no considerations of\nthis kind, and produce a generous\nsupply of their degenerate children.\nThese children, who ought never to\nhave been born, are provided for by\nthe State, and paid for by those who\nare obliged to limit their families to\ndo so. In many cases those who\nhave a sense of responsibility are\nunable to marry until late in life,\nand, even if they do eventually\nmarry, they are only able to bring\nup a small family.\nMuch harm is also done by\nmisplaced charity. Not only is it a direct evil in that it encourages the\nundesirable, but at the same time it\ndiverts much of the help which\nmight have been fitted a deserving\ncase. The support of the aged or\ninfirm is one of the dictates of\nhumanity; other forms of charity\nare use ls s, except as a temporary\nmeasure to assist the individual to\nwork out his own salvation. Any\nhelp, which enables a man to tide\nover a time of difficulty such as\nillness or trade depression, is a useful measure; but money given to\nwastrels is worse than money\nthrown into the sea, because it\nencourages them to breed.\nbut, excellent as these\nimprovements are within reasonable\nproportions, they can in their\npresent form have only an indirect\neffect on the future.\nEugenics has proved that\n(contrary to the view held by some\npeople) men are far from being born\nequal either in physical or in mental\ncharacteristics; and further, that the\nrelative value of nature is far greater\nthan that of nurture. There is a limit\nto the powers of development of any\nindividual and, short of the best\npossible training, this limit or\ncapacity, as it is called, can never\nbe reached. The best education,\ntherefore, can do no more than\ndevelop to the full capacity of\nknowledge of the individual; it can\nnever make a wise man out of a fool.\nThe powers of the individual,\nthen, are limited from the moment\n\u2022of his conception; but, to the\ncapacity of generations yet unborn\nthere is no such limit. We should\naim, then, at improving the capacity\nof future generations. Let each\ngeneration start in life a little in\nadvance of the preceding one, and\naction would interfere with the\nliberty of the individual, and could\nnot for a moment be\"tolerated. It\nwould be undesirable from almost\nevery point of view. Even granting\nthat legislation would be justifiable\nin certain extreme cases, hereditary\ndiseases for example, the difficulty\narises or where a distinction is to\nbe drawn. What man can claim that\nhe has a right to decide who shall\nor who shall not exist?\nOn the other hand many questions\nof this kind are determined by\nnatural laws, which will operate of\nthemselves as civilisation\nprogresses, if only they are allowed\nto do so. In a natural state the\nhealthy, strong and hard-working\ntend to survive at the expense of the\nweaker members of the community.\nUnfortunately, the modern\ntendency is to interfere with these\nlaws in the worst possible way\u2014to\nburden the strong with the support\nof the weak and indolent. As an\nAmerican writer has said: 'The\nworld is full of willing people; one\nhalf is willing to work, the other is\nwilling to let them.' If the latter are\nsupported by the former, this is no\ndoubt true; but, it may be supposed\nthat, goaded by necessity, many of\nthe second class would work also.\nThe conditions under which these\npeople find themselves will\ndetermine whether they are to be\nwastrels or good citizens. Ignorance\nis one of the chief sources of evil;\nand some knowledge of these\nquestions should, therefore, form a part of our education.

And\nwhy on earth was there a War?\nWhy did the British people patiently\nand expensively prepare their\narmaments, their enormous navy in\nall those ominously calm pre-war\nyears? Were they all mad. all those\nmillions of 'big navy' voters?\nDidn't Norman Angell show in\n'The Great Illusion' the futility and\nsterility of war by cold reasoned\nlogic? Thousands read the book, it\nwas reprinted again and again, and\nyet they voted for war blindly\nbelieving they were doing\nsomething for the benefit of their\ncountry. The Daily Mail drummed\nout of politics a man who had\nexpressed an appreciation of\nGermany. The paper was not to\nblame\u2014the Press lives by pleasing\nits readers who presumably derived\npatriotic pleasure from this\naction\u2014the noble worms. Perhaps\nit would be a useful object less if\nwe look a few of these self blinded\ncitizens who by now have\ndeveloped into respectable people in\ntheir forties and fifties, if we took\nperhaps one in a hundred and\npainlessly destroyed them. Voting\nthen might become more intelligent\nand youth might command more\nrespect. But when you start killing\npeople for their opinions or lack ol\nopinions you are becoming\ncommunistic and non-constructive.\nFor the mistake of the Great War\neleven million paid with their lives.\nA ghastly price for any less but has\nit been a lesson? 'Now in Britain two\nmillion, in Germany six million, in\nAmerica as many, are day by day\nrotting in unemployment. Are these\nmillions any better off than the\neleven million dead? And how\nmany more weary years must drag\nbefore someone sees light and clears\nup the mess, instead of muddling on\nyear after year in the hope that\nthings will improve of themselves.\nAnother tragic mistake now\nbecoming apparent is the enforced\npayment of Reparations by the\ndefeated powers to who the War\nGuild was conveniently attributed.\nAfter eighteen years we learn that\nBritain would have taken part in the\nGreat War even if Belgium had not\nbeen invaded. And Germany has to\nborrow money to pay Reparations,\nand her finances become unstable;\nbanks close with repercussions in\nBritain which send the pound\nsliding...\nAnd then the tariff questions\u2014to\nbe or not to be. An enormous\nnumber of people voted for tariffs\nat the last election. That they will\nhelp, at least temporarily,\nagriculture and British industries\nwhich are sorely distressed, is\ngenerally accepted. That they will\nhit on the head agriculture and\nsorely distressed industries abroad\nis not mentioned so often. Yet\ntariffs are simply economic\narmaments with which trade\nmarkets are captured. Instead of\nshooting your enemy you take away\nhis living. On the day in December\nwhen the duty on glassware came\nMental Strife\ninto operation, thousands were\nthrown out of work in Thuringia,\nand there the unemployed must\ngrow hungry. Snow is alright for\nwinter sports but it's hell for the\nman who can't afford a fire. It is\nwork either for the British or\nforeign workman. Chairty begins at\nhome but the foreigner needs it\nmore. Should we buy British or\nforeign goods? To complicate the\nquestion one must consider the\nmaintenance of the standard of\nliving and the exchange value of the\npound.\nWhy should we rack our brains\nand torture our minds with complex\nproblems like these? Because if we\nlet things slide, if we don't trouble\nto think of tariffs, and debts, and\ndisarmament, there will be a charge\nblacker than that of the Great War\nlaid against our generation.\n'The time is out of joint\u2014O curse'd spite\nThat ever we were borne to set\nit right.'\nH.H.( The Phoenix does not necessarily\nassociate itself with the views\nexpressed in this article)\nFrom the\nPhoenix of June\nJ932.

For instance the notion that\nSt Mary's would not exist if IC had\nnot ridden to the rescue is somewhat\nfacile, though I feel a few further\npoints are worth making. Firstly,\nwhile a spirit of co-operation\nbetween St Mary's and the rest of\nthe College is to be endorsed, this\nwill not happen while it is seen by\nmany students on this side of the\npark that St Mary's are a law unto\nthemselves and while students in St\nMary's see themselves as separate\nto the College as a whole. I don't say that this is fact, merely that it\nis perceived as such. It takes two to\nbe unco-operative, and it is to be\nhoped that airing the subject will\nhelp rather than hinder. It is only\nwhen you know what people think\n- through letters in Felix, for\ninstance - that you can take steps to\ncorrect them or debate with them.\nSecondly, the Nigel Baker regime\ndid not defeat the motion to abolish\nUGMs. If I remember correctly it\nwas Mr Baker who attempted to\npush the motion through, more to\ngive rein to his autocratic tendencies\nthan to help St Mary's in any way.\nIt was defeated by those students\nwho bothered to go to the relevant\nU GM, who presumably thought\nthat handing over the Union to the\nExecutive was even worse than\ncontinuing with UGMs than nobody\nhas any interest in.\nSpeaking of UGMs nobody has\nany interest in - the EG M last\nThursday was called to ratify the\nelection of Dominic Wilkinson as\nHonorary Secretary (Events), to\nelect a new House Committee\nChairman - who has considerable\ninfluence over the fabric of the\nUnion Building - and to vote on the\nThird World First motions which\nmay have resulted in four major\nbanks not being allowed to attend\nthe IC Career's Fair, Fresher's Fair\nor to advertise in any Union Media\nin protest against third world debt.\nPresumably nobody has any interest\nin this as the meeting was attended\nby virtually nobody.\nCredits\nRose, Andy T, Declan, Davids HB\nand S, Simon, James, Poddy,\nMario, Catherine, Boris, Sam,\nJonty, Stef, Bee, Scott, Toby, Steve\nN, Don Adlington, the anonymous\nauthors of the Phoenix articles, John\nPitt, Rony Douek, Marge, Troy\nTempest, Chris Leontopoulos, les\nveh icu les d 'eau voles et d roles et\nbeau coup de satyrs adroit es sans\ndirection.

    "content": "s sue9338 May 1992\nFinancial\nConfusion\nJapanese\nSuccess\nThere was considerable confusion\nlast night over the legality of the\nfunding of Silwood Park Day\nNursery. A meeting of Imperial\nCollege Union Finance Committee\n(UFC), held on Tuesday night,\ndecided that the payment of \u00a350 by\nSilwood Students' Union to the\nnursery was illegal (ultra vire s). Subsequently, senior union officers\ntelephoned Silwood to instruct\nunion members there to end funding\nof the nursery.\nIndependent observers told\nImperial College News Network\n(i CNN) that the funding of the\nnursery is not illegal. If this opinion\nis correct, it means that the two year\nold decision by IC Union to cut the\nfunding to the Imperial College Day\nNursery, in Prince's Gardens, was\nunnecessary, and that funding to\nSilwood Day Nursery can be\nrestored.\nThe confusion is due to the lack\nof a firm definition of an ultra vire s payment. In 1983 the Attorney\nGeneral issued guidelines defining\nwhat was improper expenditure by\nstudent unions. This followed\nallegations that student unions, most\nof which have charitable status, had\nbeen making large donations to\npolitical bodies, during the\npolitically sensitive miners' strike.\nThe 1983 letter from the Attorney\nGeneral read that all expenditure\nshould be seen to be 'representing\nand furthering the interests of the\nstudents' and should 'assist in the\neducational aims of the college'.\nThis has been taken by IC Union\nofficers to mean that all expenditure\nmust give some form of return to\nstudents, in terms of material\nbenefits or services. On this basis,\nit has been decided that the nursery\ndoes not give direct benefit to\nstudents, an interpretation which\nitself has been questioned.\nA solicitor for the Attorney\nGeneral's office yesterday told\ni CNN that an ultra vire s payment\nwas one where money was used for\nparty political purposes. A press\nofficer for the National Union of\nStudents told us that for a payment\nto be legal, it must have some\neducational benefit. Charity\n- commissioners, who have financial\nauditing responsibilities for most\nstudent unions, said that students'\nunions may only spend money on\nthe beneficiaries named in their\ncharter.\nAn independent financial expert\nconsulted by i CNN told us that the\nlegal deliberations of the Attorney\nGeneral's office were of no\nrelevance in this instance. He said\nthat as both Imperial College Union\nand the Imperial College Day\nNursery did not exist financially in\ntheir own right, they are regarded,\nfor charitable status, as parts of the\ncollege. This interpretation was\nconfirmed for i CNN by the\nCharities Commission, who found\nImperial College Union listed as an\nintegral part of Imperial College. In\nthis case, the payment of money\nfrom ICU to the Day Nursery could\nbe regarded as Imperial College\nmoving money around different\nfinancial departments, and therefore\nwould not constitute an ultra vire s payment.\nOur expert further told us that the\ncharter that establishes the college\nas an exempt charity, states that the\nmain aim of the college is to educate\nstudents and provide relevant\nservices to further that goal. In this\nlight, the Day Nursery aids student\nwelfare in the same way as halls of\nresidence and refectories.\nAs officers of the Union are\naccountable and personally liable\nfor the expenditure they may have\nto repay any funds that are spent\nimproperly. Hence, union officers\nare moving with caution on this\nissue. The position appears to be\none of correcting past mistakes.\nImperial's Rowing Club has won\nthe 'Japanese Henley Regatta' for\nthe second year running. This year\nthey were pitted against Nihon\nUniversity, Wasada University\n(Japan) and Bristol University.\nThey won by a three-quarter length\nover Bristol. Bill Mason, the Coach\nof the IC Rowing Club, told Felix\nthat the Regatta was a 'sister event'\nto the British race of the same name\nand university crews came from all\nover the world to compete. 'We\ndemolished Bristol,' he added.\nHe said that the two British crews\nwere given boats cut for Japanese\nsi7.e. and as the British teams were\non average eight kilos heavier per\nperson 'we were going under the\nwaves rather than over them.'\nYesterday (Thursday 7 May), Mr\nMason went with the second eight\nto Dublin to compete in the 400th Trinity Regatta, where they will\ncompete against a number of Irish\ncrews.\nThis victory follows last week's news that IC Sailing Club won the\nJet Sea Cup Challenge. The Jet Sea\nteam had difficult ly in raising\nenough sponsorship money to take\npart in the Martinique Challenge.\nThe team sent professionally\npublished brochures to over 100\nFrench and British companies but\nreceived no response. The team\nthen turned to college sponsors. The\nOld Centralians (City and Guilds\nOld Students' Association)\nsupported the venture. Funding\napplications were made to the\nRector, Sir Eric Ash, to Imperial\nCollege Union and to the Chairman\nof IC's Governing Body, Sir Frank\nCooper. The Harlington Trust,\nwhich uses funds generated from\nthe excavation of gravel from IC's Harlington sports ground, also\ndonated funds for the venture. The\nteam members gave \u00a3300 each of\ntheir own money because enough\nsponsorship still had not been\nraised.\nSorry\nMany apologies are due for the\n'bohemian' page layout of this\nweek's Felix. Due to a printing\nerror the pages are in no discern able logical order. Please adjust your\nFelices, normal service will resume\nnext week.\n\n"

Jumping about the stage in\na schoolgirl gym skirt and\ncam of l age print leggings there is a certain, definite charisma and\npresence about her. With a powerful vocal performance she is\ndefinitely in control. The guitarist\nand bassist laid down some essential\nriffs and rhythms, the sole guitarist\nswitching competently from\ncrunching rhythm to blistering lead.\nThey played a fairly short forty-five\nminute set with a few numbers I could remember from six months\npreviously like Little Boy and\nInbetween mixed with newer\nmaterial. Their guitarist is a new\naddition replacing the one they were\nborrowing previously and has to\ntake much of the credit for the\nbands rise from pubs to big clubs.\nThis band is definitely a rock band\nand, as such, is unlikely to ever\nsurface in the charts but for anyone\nwho has any faith left in the music\nindustry it seems they must soon\ncapture a recording contract.

'Sky\nWest and Crooked'\u2014who knows\nwhat it's all about. Card games\npossibly.

Assyria passed a law compelling\nmarried women to wear veils; the\ncustom has survived to modern\ntimes? And, did you know; Bishop\nIsidore of Seville insisted that the\ntouch of a menstruating woman\ncould prevent fruit from ripening\nand cause plants to die? Interesting\nhuh?\nI find it difficult to say what\nAngels and Amazons is about. I'm not quite sure. It's circus-theatre.\nSo we have juggling, acrobatics,\ndancing, mime, singing and\nwalking on glass! Three Greek\nGoddesses, feeling a little bored,\ndecide to come to earth to play their\nway through female artistes of the\npast. That's the only thread\nthroughout and it's hard to describe\nhow and why I didn't like it.\nThe cast seemed to take us, the\naudience, for granted. They seemed\nto think that each and every one of\nus were their friends. Hence, they\nwere a bit too casual, a bit too\ngiggly at their own mistakes and a bit too self indulgent. It all ended\nwith a messy, moist menage-a trois.\nIt seems that Ra-Ra Zoo do have\nquite a following and if you are\nuncomfortable with overt\nhomosexuality and lesbianism you\nshould be prepared.

Director Richard Jones and his\nunfortunate cast have rendered this\ngem of a play a total nightmare.\nGentilhomme is a comedy of\nmanners, charting the rise of the\nstupid bourgeois\u2014Monsieur\nJourdain, with grand aspirations.\nHis forays into education, fashion,\nsocial ising and his ambitions for the\nmarriage of his daughter are\nsparkling ly articulated in Moliere's original, full of wit, refreshing\ncynicism and masterly ease of\ndialect. Unfortunately, the adaptor\nNick Dear thinks he knows better\nthan the great playwright and scores\nof talented translators over the last\n300 years. This insult of an\nadaptation is more accurately a bastard is ation of plot and script to\nSun-headline vocabulary and\nschool-pantomime antics. Timothy\nSpall (M. Jourdain) blunders and\npouts out a foul-mouthed moron\nrather than Moliere's intended\nendearing simpleton. Anita (Ange!)\nDobson (Mme Jourdain) should\nstick to singing where her hamming\nand screeching would be more apt.\nSupporting actors did a brave job\nwith their tarzan text. Well done to\nthe set designers 'The Brothers\nQuay' for their original and stylish\narena for this fiasco. The question\nremains\u2014how can director, adaptor\nand actors at the National Theatre,\nflagship of British drama, create\nand condone an enterprise so\nstunningly vulgar, so thoroughly\npuerile, so completely embarrassing\nand call it art?

Currently running at the Barbican\nis their colossal production of H.4. part one (as they say in the\nbusiness). The curtain opens to an\natmospheric and expensive set. It\nhas all the requirements of an\nadequate production; A fat and\nfunny Falstaff (Robert Stephens), a dynamic Hotspur (Owen Teale) and\na vibrant, cheeky Hal (Michael\nMaloney). These three core\nperformances were good, but not\ngreat. Julian Glover's performance\nas the king was dry and all the court\nscenes were airy, dry icy and\nbenign. The sets are more powerful\nthan any of the performances and\nnone of the acting is as strong as the\nimagery.\nOf course, this is the R.S.C.( loves) and it's going to be good.\nSomehow, I fear, they've lost sight\nof the simplicity and directness of\ngreat acting and it seems that the\neffort and expenditure of this\nproduction has missed its target.

    "content": "8 May 1992 Felix 933 Letters\nPervert Examination Leaked\nDear Adam.\nI would like to complain about the\nin si duo us comments concerning my\nlove life in your column this week.\nI refer of course to the odds of 7:6\ngiven to yourself. 'Wishful\nthinking' say I! We all know who\nyou are, you sneaky, perverted,\nexcuse for a Felix Editor, I find it\nappalling that your paper should\nsink to these levels to fill its pages.\nYours disgustedly,\nRachel Mountford, Civ Eng 2.\nDear Adam.\nThe following point has come to\nour attention and we write on behalf\nof a number of colleagues.\nOn Tuesday 28 April 1992 a considerable number of students sat\nthe Accounting and Finance exam.\nThis is a humanities option run by\nthe management school and taken\nby:\nMech Eng, Chem Eng, Elec Eng,\nPhysics and Materials Science\nsecond, third and fourth year\nstudents.\nThe paper was a direct (actually\nword for word) copy of the 1987\npaper. Unknown to the\nManagement School, the paper was\navailable in the Mech Eng library.\nOfficially only the 1991 paper\nand worked solutions were\navailable; however some students\nhad access to at least the '87, '88,\n'89 papers and official worked\nsolutions. This is an 'open book'\nexam, which meant that some\nstudents were able to copy the\nsolutions directly from their notes.\nThe course is lectured and exams\nset by the Management School.\nAn examination is designed to be\na fair test of a student's ability, and\nin this case it was not. We await\nfurther action to be taken by\nCollege.\nYours sincerely.\nNames withheld by request.\nDecline and Death, Four\n(lines on the death of Francis Bacon; John Major,\nas a spider, crawls across a portrait of his corpse)\nWhere is your wound, friend to the full-blood?\nNoblesse avenger, a ruby-rich liver crammed hard in;\nbut, from an opaque palette, (to little consequence)\narise a narrow-minded knife ridding doubt and freeing\nThe Obvious! (don't think, simile) Austere in the absence\nof pain, null and numb. Grey matter, grey mouths; dolorous,\nbe. frustrated no more!\nHe still stands before blankness, carving time in paint to\npale shades; visceral traps a body, gouache form quicksilver-cruel mouth, MY drunken, sodden monster in the head. I am rapt,\nsacrificed to the iconoclast; curling and sullen, the sanguine\nteeth, it or I eat the work, a figure with meat.\nHow rapt and question less. But, one will die and go grey, and will not be your lover (caress\nthe air with fingertip savagery. Direction, not verse) See! I am\nrent, and will not be! Grinning most polished ly, 'Thing on the end of\nMother of Pearl' departs the dull strop to kiss the ranks.\nNo sympathy for your slit ted, screaming chest, but 'everyone else is\nwounded.' Man of gauze!? Touch, and heal all.\nDA Spooner, 1992.\nis the 'United Nations Initiative on Namibia' Bar?\nInexcusable Thrusting\nunion. This is despite our sources\n(different ones this time) telling us\nthat the Deputy President was\nmandated by Bar and Catering\nCommittee to write to us about the\nstory. However, I can report\nprogress. We have established new\nlinks with the union, and they are\nnow talking to us. This is most\nwelcome. They have now realised\nthat it is only by a freer flow of\ninformation that college media are\nto get their stories right first time,\nand that it is not enough for the\nunion to leave us guessing, and then\ncomplain if we, infrequently, get it\nwrong. We welcome our re-admission to civilisation.\nOne final point. It must be\npointed out, for the benefit of those\nwho have not grasped this basic\npoint, that the Felix article, dated\n18 March 1992, was in no way\ninaccurate. The article began, TC Radio reported on 6th March,' and\nthen repeated the above transcript.\nIt is not in doubt that IC Radio\nbroadcast the above transcribed\nsection. To suggest otherwise\nsmacks of illiteracy. OK, Zoe?\nMy apologies for boring you,\nthough I hope I have been obscure\nenough. As per usual.\nKind regards. Many pleasures in\nyour retirement.\n(While the cat's away )\nDeclan Curry,\nNews Editor. Imperial College\nRadio.\nDear Sir.\nAs a former contributor to your\nmagazine, and fellow student\nnewspaper editor, I must complain\nin the strongest possible terms about\nthe behaviour of your so-called\nmusic editor, 'Poddy' at the recent\n'London Student' party. The\nconstant expression of his extreme\nright wing views caused the\nattendees from Queen Mary and\nWestfield College much distress, as\nthey pride themselves on their\npolitically correct views. While\nsuch people as 'Poddy' have a right\nto their views, to thrust them\nunwanted on others is inexcusable.\nWhile on the subject of\ninexcusable thrusting, the advances\nhe made on every single female\nfrom Q MW, were frankly, sexist\nand bordered on sexual h arras ment, and left several of them extremely\ndistressed.\nI hope you will take the action\nyou feel is appropriate.\nYours faithfully,\nAdam Tinworth, Cub Editor\n1991-92, Felix reviews editor\n89-91, aka Pendragon.\nRevolting Vandalism\nDear Adam,\nMalaysian Society's notices,\nincluding a Malay New Year card\nfor the Malay students, pinched on\na high-quality, multi-colour Al poster on the noticeboard along the\nwalkway was all found disappeared\nthis afternoon, 1st May.\nImmediately I contacted Steve\nFarrant, the Hon Sec (Events), who\nlater promised to bring up the\nmotion in the EG M next\nWednesday.\nFor years, Malaysian Society has\nbeen using section No. 13 on the\nnoticeboard, (honestly) not knowing\nthat its bona fide space is in fact\nsection No. 8. Such examples are\nnot scarce. Section No. 8, as in our\ncase, has been occupied by the\nChinese Society for a considerable\nperiod of time. Moreover, there are\nalways 40-50% of empty spaces\naround at any one time, to say the\nleast. It is therefore highly unlikely\nthat any society/club will resort to\nclaim the space at this very\nmoment, except the motive to\nsabotage.\nThis act of malice is particularly\ndamaging as the Sunday's celebration (3rd May) is the first\nmajor event organised by the new\ncommittee, making the task to\nnotify its members in 72 hours a nigh impossible task. Should the\nposter be removed at an earlier\nstage, the event would be wholly\ndisastrous, especially when guests\nfrom three societies and the Union\nare invited. Therefore to act so\noutrageously without scruple and to\nignore the consequences is indeed\ndisgraceful and revolting.\nA space on the noticeboard\nenables a society to be in intimate\ncontact with, not only its members,\nbut indeed everyone in the College\ncommunity. Whatever the motive\nbehind such irresponsible and\nimmature act, is inexcusable.\nContemptuous act of vandalism like\nsuch, with strong elements of\nwanton destruction, is highly\nregrettable and should be subjected\nto condemnation.\nYours sincerely,\nH.M. Kho, ICMS Secretary.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

The mysterious and\nimposing rocks of Meteora, found\nin the western point of Thessalia,\nin central Greece, form a strange\nrocky forest consisting of over 1000\nstony outcrops. Some are huge and\nSaint Athanassius the Meteorite,\ngave the name to the 'wide stone'\nhe first climbed in 1344 A.D. The\nadjective 'meteor', or in greek,\n'meteor os', was derived from the\nancient words next x( after)-and\na e ipo( raise), meaning 'tall' (ie\nraised) or 'suspended.' Maybe this\nwas the most suitable name for the\nMeteora\nThe Rocky Forest of Jesus\nChris\nLeontopoulos,\nVice President\nof the ICU\nHellenic Society,\ndescribes a singular and\nrelatively\nunknown part of\nGreece\nwide, whilst others are small and\nmeagre, more suggestive of\nskeletons. They all tower to the sky,\ngiving the impression of some other\nsuper world. The trunks that make up this\nforest gives you the impression of\npetrified mythical giants, but the\nringing of nearby churches' bells\nand the sight of their domes reminds\nyou that this is holy property - it is\nthe 'stony forest of Jesus.' The\nancient monasteries which still\nadorn the tops of the rocks retain\ntheir vivid Byzantine colour and\northodox tradition - an area\nuntouched by time, an acropolis of\nthe spirit defending itself against the\nmaterialistic attitudes of the modern\nage.\npetrified\nmythical giants\nMeteora is an ideal place for\nspiritual up lj ft and meditation. If\nyou want to learn how to pray, it\nis worthwhile going there at night\nand staying a little out of the way,\nalone. The sky is closer, the stars\nshine more vividly and at dawn you\ncan hear the birds joining with the\nmonks in their morning praise.\nThe name 'Meteora' is not\nancient. The founder of the Holy\nMonastery of the Transfiguration,\nrocks which were to offer\nhospitality to people called to live\nabove the earth, though belonging\nto the earth - to live between earth\nand heaven.\nThere is not much historical\nevidence concerning the rocks. The\ndearth of records, both ancient and\nmodern, belies the interest to be\nfound in this splendid place. In his\nbook 'Thessalia and Ipiros' (1897),\nthe German Geologist Al. Philopson remarks on the pebble-like nature of the rocks and hills and\ndoes not contradict the old tradition\nof an ancient sea of Thessaly.\nEven the most casual visitor to\nthe Meteorite monasteries must\nwonder how the first monks\nascended those virgin, slippery and\ncolossal rocks. Originally the visitor\nwas hauled up in a net basket on the\nend of a rope, though today the\nascent is aided by a smooth car\nroad. The closest town to Meteora\nis Kalambaka, its name meaning\n'conspicuous fortress,' since the\nrocks give the impression of a gigantic natural fortress from there.\nRecently, Kalambaka has developed\ninto an important town where new\nand comfortable hotels are available\nfor visitors who may want to see the\nhistoric monasteries at their leisure.\nHAIRDRESSERS\n15A HARRINGTON ROAD,\nSOUTH KENSINGTON\n071-823 8968\nWe have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women\nCheck us out !\n\u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

The use of these\nrooms was changed from time to\ntime to meet the increased demand\nfor dining room accommodation,\nand the Library on the first floor\nbecame an additional Luncheon\nRoom, the private Luncheon Room\nfor the Governors and Professors\nbecame also the Secretary's Office,\nand the Secretary's Office off the\nmain Entrance Hall was\ntransformed into a bar and buffet.\nAlmost at the same time the\ncollege books tall was transferred to\nthe Union and occupied part of the\nEntrance Hall on the Albert Hall\nlevel.\nThe Gymnasium which served\nvarious purposes, for plays,\nconcerts, dances, boxing and\nfencing matches gradually lost\ninterest as a Gymnasium and the\nspecial apparatus was removed.\nThe furnishing and equipment of\nthe building was provided by\ndonations from the City companies,\nthe Governors, Professors and old\nstudents.\nIn its first year\nit was regarded\nsomewhat\ntimidly by some\nof the students\nand was by no\nmeans\nuniversally\npatronised.\nThe growing up of the Union may\nbe divided into two periods\nseparated by the War. From\n1911-1914, in its infancy its growth\nwas slow but on the whole, in spite\nof competing interests, vigorous.\nIn its first year it was regarded\nsomewhat timidly by some of the\nstudents and was by no means\nuniversally patronised. It was\ninteresting to observe how those\nwho came in by twos and threes as\nit were on a voyage of discovery\nwhen once they had investigated the\namenities which it offered, stayed\nand induced others also to come.\nGradually its use for all social\nevents became general. At the\noutset entertainment was evident in\nplays, concerts\u2014the three colleges\nhaving at that time a wealth of talent\nboth ont he dramatic and musical\nside\u2014and dances.\nThe rules of the Union laid it\ndown that the three Colleges should\nnominate the President of the Union\nin turn, and it fell to the lot of the\nRoyal School of Mines to nominate\nthe first President. The Union has\nbeen fortunate in having a succession of Presidents who were\nready to devote time and energy to\nits progress.\nDuring the War the Union served\nnot only as a meeting place of its\nmembers when on leave, but as the\nHeadquarters of the United Arts\nVolunteer Rifles, and of the\nReserve of Guards Officers. The\ncollection of photographs which is\nnow in the Bar was made at this\nperiod. Naturally its ordinary\nactivities were suspended and, it is\nalmost ture to say that, after the\nWar a fresh start had to be made.\nFrom 1918 to the present time\nand development in every direction\nhas been remarkable. Members of\n1911 revisiting the Union today\nwould find the most significant\nchanges. They would find buildings\nto the south, east and west of them,\nhostels to house a hundred students,\nincreased and increasing\naccommodation for meals and a great extension of social activities.\nThey would find in the Reading\nRoom a collection of Challenge\nCups (which would excite the envy\nof any motor bandit) and of heads\nof big game.\nThey would find the Bar, where\nformerly there was only a small\nnumber of pewter tankards, now\nresplendent with the finest\ncollection of them one could wish\nto see. An excellent custom has\nbeen introduced in which in many\ncases a member when leaving the\ncollege hands his tankard on to a worthy successor. They would look\nin vain for the Bookstall which has\nbeen transferred to the building on\nthe south where are also the\nadministrative offices of the\ncollege. And they would regret that\nthey would not find so many of their\ncontemporaries as they would like\nto see.\nAny account of the Union would\nbe incomplete without a mention of\nthe remarkable improvement in the\nCriticism was made of the kitchen by\nsaying that it was as large as that on\nboard ship, to which the meek critic\nobjected that the building was on land\nand there was plenty of it.\nprovision of meals which has taken\nplace in the last few years. In the\nfirst year the catering was done\nunder contract by a firm of\nprofessional caterers who did not\nfind it sufficiently profitable.\nAfterwards, as no other firm\u2014not\neven Messrs Lyons\u2014would\nundertake it, the Committee di cide d to put the responsibility in the hands\nof the Secretary. The arrangement\nworked satisfactorily until War\nbroke out with a consequent\ndecrease in the number of meals and\ngreat difficulty in obtaining\nsupplies. More recently the\nSecretary was relieved of this work\nand the catering put in the hands of\na manager and manager ess appointed by the Committee, with\nthe result that as good fare is\nobtainable as anywhere in London\nat a charge which is almost\nincredibly small.\nIt would be both superfluous and\nimpertinent to conclude by saying\nthat, after twenty-one years, the\nUnion has more than justified the\nhopes of those who founded it. It\nwould be more pertinent to urge that\nin view of its great value to the\nCollege, the very considerable use\nto which it is put and the importance\nof the services which it renders, the\nbest tribute that could be paid to its\nfounders would be to enlarge the\naccommodation where it is most\nrequired, and thus ensure its greater\nperfection.\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
