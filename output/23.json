    "content": "2 FELIX LETTERS TO THE EDITOR CHALLENGE UNIVERSITY ANTHOLOGY\nDear Sir,I would like to correct a statement, made in the account of the I.C. Mountaineering Club Dinner, which appeared in your last issue. The traverse of the Union Entrance Hall has\nbeen made before, notably by the I.C. R.F.C. of\n1948/49. Conditions were standardised for this, and while they may not meet the rigorous demands\nof the Mountaineering Club, they were felt to give a reasonable trial of ski il for the team. As far as I can remember, the conditions were:- rubber soled shoes, no spikes, cramp on s,ice axes or ropes,\nand climb round with the sun. The northern door to the Old Lounge was closed, and the brackets for the\nstrip lights over the notice boards were used as\nextra hand holds. Is the Mountaineering Club interested in a joint meet by the Lion's Flank? Yours faithfully, M.D. HazelJ\nLIBRARY FACILITIES\nSir May I suggest ,m amendment to the notices re\ngard ing our library service? In order to bring them into line with the true state of affairs they should read: From now on the library will re main closed both between 1-2 p.m. and 5-6 p.m. This would at least save would-be readers From\nneedless frustration. Seriously, however, the library service has\nsteadily deteriorated during the session. The\nlibrarians either saunter in unconcernedly20 min-ute slate, or don't turn up at all. I myself have repeatedly offered my services to the Chief Librarian, but have been told that he\nhas all the help he requires. If that is so, why\ncan't we have a library which atleast occasion all; opens at the appointed times? Yours faithfully, Anne May ( E.C SO( We brought Miss May's complaints to the attention of the Library Committee and received the fol'. ow-ing reply. Ed.)\nSir It is quite true that the Library was not\nopen on two occasions recently because of the illness( unknown to the rest of the Committee) of the assistant who should have been on duty. Any inconvenience there by caused to readers is regretted I can hardly think, however, that things are as bad;\nas Miss May suggests, or other people would surely have complained before this. Any helpful criticism, or suggestions for the improvement of the Library, will of course be welcomed by the Committee.\nWhen Kia a May offered her services it so happ*ened that we did not require any additional help, but the end of the Session brings with it the Comm.\nit tee's biggest annual headache - stock taking. May\nI ask anyone who would be willing to help in this work at the end of June, or in July, to write to\nme c/o the Union rack, stating the dates and time\nof day when they would be available. Yours faithfully, D.N. Layton.\n(Chairman, I.C.U.

It is hard to sing ie out any individual athlete, and it would not be fair to do so as we com-o etc das a team, butTed Whitlock' s3mile record was such a piece of inspired running that it des-erve s the highest praise. Ted knocked seconds\noff the14 year old University record, and hit his best form. Cyril Kay rana very gallant mile race and, though he was second, his time established a new I.C. record.

Anderson( Michigan Red Sox) and MacMillan( Schenectady Tigers) were relatively unsuccessful, but hopes were sustained by the atomic\nbatting of 'Bronx' Karpov itch(14) and the rustic antics of Coleman ( 3 4 not out).

C.1st team short of two regular player s^pence Bate still suffering from a sprained ankle and the captain, who had been inconsiderate enough to catch a heavy cold. Thus two regular pairs were broken. Fortunately a reserve pair( Grossman and Watson) had\nbeen successfully blooded the week before, and they\nwere brought in as3 rd string. Forbes and MacDonald\nbecame 1 st string and the remnants of the old1 st and\n3 rd pair( Wright and Ward) became 2nd string. The first matches on court were the respective1 st and 3 rd pairs, and after games of fluctuating fortune our1 st pair lost and the3 rd pair won by narrow margins. 'While the rest had tea the second\npairs fought it out, the I.C.p air losing in3 sets, and so the end of the1 st round found U.C.21 up.\nThen came the big surprise of the afternoon: oar3 rd pair, after being overwhelmed in the first set, fought back tenaciously against the U.C. first string, which consisted of2 University players, and brought\noff a thrilling victory. Meanwhile ou a? own 1 st pair had had to struggle hard to defeat a game U.C.3 rd pair. Our opponents drew level when their2 nd pair be a tour gallant3 rd string. Disappointment fol lowed when Wright and Ward lost ra there as i. lv to the opposition's by now very tired Is t pair, but successfully accounted for the U.C,3 rd pair. And so eight o' clock came with the score at* all and the light beg inning to fade. Could one or other of the opposing\npairs in the deciding rubber( Forbes and McDonald for I.C. and Simpson and Gronow for U.C.) dispose of the opposition quickly before darkness fell? The answer\nwas a most emphatic no. Three quarters of an hour\nlater found them still playing the first set, score6 all, with no hope of a quick finish. By mutual consent, it was agreed to restart the undecided match on the following Monday evening, and\na good crowd of I.C. supporters watched anxiously' as the U.C. pair started off very confidently playing sound tennis. The I.C.p air, however, were not disturbed, and the games went evenly to3 all At this point Forbes and McDonald took complete charge\nand in the face of their consistency the opposition cracked. Playing very strongly indeed, our players won 6-3, 6-1. to take us into the SemiFinal by 5\nrubbers to4. At H arlington: CC S.Old Boys 120 - I.C.1218. This game produced an eliciting finish and was event-u ally won by a single off the the last ball of the day. I.C., for whom Reynolds took435, allowed the opposition's ninth wicket to put on over50. An over slow start to the batting was followed by a scramble for runs against the clock, in which wickets were thrown away.

C.C. the representative of the Chess Club proposed that Union Council he strongly recommended to permit the Captain of the\nChess Club to award colours to deserving members of\nhis team. The motion, after considerable discuss ion, was carried nem.con.\nIf a person is awarded colours at any University or College he must:\n1. Be playing regularly for a team playing comp et it ive games.\n2. Possess noticeable skill and ability in that game.\nThe fact that London University Purples are\nawarded for prowess at Chess, and that Oxford and\nCambridge Chess players are awarded half blues demonstrates that the games need not be ' Athletic in nature. The Secretary of the A.C.C. present at the S. C.C. meeting as an observer expressed the view that Colours were the sole prerogative of the A.C.C. and\nthat although members of the Chess Club deserved\nsome sort of recognition, it should be in the form\nof a\" Merit Award\" available to Social Clubs gene-rally. This solution of the 'problem' is impracticable: there are only two clubs on the S. C.C. whose members could qualify for colours( or whatever\nelse they be called) the Bridge and Chess Clubs;\nsurely it is not suggested that a special Blazer and Tie be provided for only two clubs. Logically, members of the I.C. Chess Team should\nbe eligible for Colours. The team this year was\ntop of the University Chess League and won all its games, qualifying under section( I) above. Three\nmembers of the team were awarded University Purples, and six other members have played for the University \u2014 sufficient evidence that they possess the\nnecessary ability. Should Union Council decide to permit the Chess\nCaptain to award colours, the awards would have to be subject to approval, and since the A.C.C. have\na Sub-Commitee to approve A.C.C. colours the simplest procedure would be for them to approve the\nChess colours as well.1. The Russian player Nimzowitsch once broke his leg playing chess, but lest this prejudice any Union Officers against the Chess Club I hasten to add that it occured before1917.2. Should clubs like the Ski Club participate in matches they would qualify as Athletic Clubs. A.N.NO The split of the Union Clubs Committee into Social and Athletic Clubs took place in19*5, and\nwas first prop os ed in order that there should be\ntwo Committees, one of which could award Colours and one of which could not. This led to the formation of two Committees, but their composition was\nnot agreed until the definition was laid down :\n\"That an Athletic Club is one which participates in competitive sport involving physical exertion\". On this basis it is difficult to see how any of the present Social Clubs can qualify for the Col ours\" now awarded by this College. Colours are universally accepted as a recognition of athletic prowess, not, as is cited in the claim of certain O lub s, as a mark of prowess\nin competition. Athletic, not competitive. qualifies the status of a Colour. These Clubs cite as one of their claims, the precedent of older institutions such as Oxford and Cambridge who award\nHalf El u es in certain games of doubtful athletic standing, and of the University of London who\nawards Full Purples, in some similar cases, with out the right to wear the blazer. Concerning the award of the \u00a3i ue, there seems\nto be some claim in view of it, but it must be re membered that the Imperial College Colour cannot be\ncom pae ed in status with the Blue, now in all faith so universally accepted that were it awarded fort idd ley winks it would have prestige value. Nor\nshould the Blue be confused with our Colour in that the mechanism of the award is, in general, different. Turning to the course which London has adopted, there again there is some anomaly, for in the Objects of its Colours Constitution, it is categorically stated that the Purple award shall be maintained at such a level that it denotes a high standard of athletic prowess, yet included in its list of sports for which Colours can be awarded is chess, a game, and certainly non athletic. This award is, however, modified by the right to wear a tie only. Let us than restrict the Colours of Imperial College to the purpose for which they are intended \u2014\nathletic prowess.\nSo\nft\n\u2022\nH<U<H H at\n<H si\n4*\nis\nevents\nATHLETIC SAT. 2nd JUNE - I.C.

John Francis Marlande Rambaut (pronounced as\nIn thrombosis) was born in Kai aya in1925. His a yah informs FBLIX that he first opened his eyes in1927. This capacity for sleep, especially a tI.C.

He was\nsent to England to be educated and after leaving Repton with cricket and hockey colours, took an\nengineering cadet ship at the Crambourne School of Mines'. Leaving this rival, if not enemy, institution he became a surveying Instructor( Lieut. R.E). John was de mobbed in1948 and then entered the1 st year of the civil engineering department at Guilds.

Dr. Dingwall, the guest speaker, presented his subject in a most con-vinci ng mai mer, interspersing his well reasoned arguments with delightful anecdotes. He was largely asce pti c and had been responsible for debunking many so called psychic phenom ea a, for, being a mem-ber of the Magic Circle, he was particularly well equipped to detect fraudulent practices. But, after careful examination of all the information which he had gathered,he concluded that certain as\nyet inexplicable phenomena could and did occur. The interaction between the minds of two people( telepathy) was one example. Regarding the' interaction' between the mind and material objects( levitation etc.) he was more doubtful but believed that this might also occur. He was of the definite opinion that 'ghosts' were purely subjective material is at ions but being among other things a psychiatrist, he was very interested in the mechanism by which such images could be superimposed\non the external world. In thanking Dr. Dingwall for his lucid account of our present knowledge of the psychic world, the Rector stressed the difficulty of testing such\nsubjective phenomena scientifically j but he cons ide red that in this field lay the possibility of discoveries so fundamental and far reaching as to merit our serious attention. It was, as he put it,* a thoroughly respectable subject to investigate\". And sx> ended am< sst enjoyable weekend spent\nin the tranquil atmosphere of the countryside.

The race occurred after the Elections last Friday, the five teams assembling with their transport and supporters at about 2.30 pm.\nFive25 ft. long Sky lons were run out from\nQueenies basement by their constructors, fitted with their departmental flags and held aloft by\ntheir crews. The conditions and articles of the\nRace were that the Sky lons must be maintained aloft throughout their journey, and that the winners were\nthe first department to erect their s on the centre of the roundabout between the Power Station and the\nFun fare. The original plan to include a boat race on the Fun fare lake was deemed imp rac tib le, and an\neven earlier plan was to race downstream to Southbank in10 ft.

The\nCivil s Vertical Featured ol lapsed in indeterminate state, but survived. The Aero.

Two\nPolice Cars just missed them at South Ken.\nThe chemical engineers were the first to arrive on Chelsea Bridge.were stopped and given perm is sion to continue; but later their SkyIon was\nbroken up against their car by authority.

They were asked to choose between a complete\nbut in erect able Skyl on and an incomplete but proper\nSkyl on; and with great humour and restraint chose\nthe latter by a majority decision. The Mechanical s were no bb led early by the\nCivil s, but came in within the first four,4 to a motorbike.

These\nindependent discussions do not succeed in reconciling the feeling that outstanding efforts on\nbehalf of the College should be honoured equally in all competitive activities, with the opinion that Colours are popularly recognized as Athletic honours.\nThere are many complicating points! the University award colours for certain activities fal ling within our Social activities; and there are\nthe cases of activities bordering between the.\n' Social1 and ' Athletic' are bowls and billiards athletic; and is chess an activity? We feel that there are other solutions; such\nas by the institution of \"Honours\" as awards in the Social Clubs. A scheme such a this seems desi r able in order to give recognition and encouragement to high standards in these activities, but at the same time care should be taken to avoid a clash with the traditions of existing institutions. CAS I THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE Once again the Goddess Juno\nBrings her Seasonal Ordeal. Useless to protest to Uno:\nThere is simply no appeal. How, then, does the Student take it, Poising on the very Brink? Life, they say, is what you make it So he has another drink. Now the Easter vac is finished Should he think on what he's taught?\nShould his nights out be diminished? Should he spend less time on sport? Heeding his Professor's strictures, Spend more time with pen and ink? Fewer evenings at the Pictures? Is it likely, do you think? See his look of concentration Picking books up with3 frown. ate his painful contemplation Hurriedly he puts them down.\nWeeks flit by, the time draws nearer, Moments now more precious are ;\nBeer, however, is no dearer See him, therefore, in the Bar. Batch him now restore his liver On the Track at Mot spur Park.\nAfternoons upon the River. Strolls with PoBsy after dark.\nShould he read, his notes tomorrow?\nLo! The Day is drawing near. Closer is the time of Sorrow, May is over, June is here.\nBut the morrow dawns so brightly, 'Twere as into stay indoors. Goes he then to Lords how rightly! And to Hell with Kir ch off's* Lawsl\nShould he, in a final flurry, On the evening of the Test Fill his brain up in a hurry? Better far to let it rest. Finally, behold the Dawning\nOf that un propitious Day:\nLightly we will sketch the morning, Kindly, very little say.\nIn the Chamber uninviting Centuries of fear and doubt,\nTen square miles of frantic writing And, at last, he staggers out.\nSunshine glitters, life i a heaven.\nGratefully he lights a fag. \"What did you make number seven?\" \"Number four was in the bag!\"\nOptimistic claims are scattered To and fro among the bunch;\nFearful les this dreams be s natt ered, Off he wanders to his lunch. After weeks of weary waiting See the Lists upon the board: This the moment all were hating. Which end shall we start? \"Good Lord!\" \"Smith was brighter than we reckoned.\" \"What's his-name has got a first!\" \"So-and-so has got a second.\"\nWhere's my name, before I burst? GRASS TRACK RACING New records are constantly being made, and the\nsportsman of today is forever on his mettle as a result of better and better performances by others. Many of us will no doubt be jealous of the record speed of 50 miles per hour which has recently been\nset up by a gentleman on a hot ted up mowing machine\nNo other details of this astonishing feat are available to the writer and the condition can only be\nconjectured. Few people can hope to run at speeds\nin excess of 20 miles per hour, so that it seems\nimprobable that the record breaker followed his mac\nh in e on foot, and although roller skates are a possibility it Is more likely that a roller seat\n( specially lightened for the occasion) towed along, was used. In this case the machine would have to\nbe a larg ish one, such as is used a tH arlington, and imagination suggests that the spectacle must\nhave been an a we inspiring one.\nWe are hazy about the rules of mower racing and\nit would be interesting to know whether the cutting cylinder is retained, and if so whether there are\nany regulations concerning the length of grass to be cut; further, supposing a mean speed is taken\nof two runs in opposite directions, are contestants allowed to empty the grass box before the return run? These, and many other fascinating questions will no doubt occur to every sportsman of an enquiring turn of mind.\nThe formation of an I.C. Mower Racing Club,\napart from the aesthetic pleasure to be derived from the pursuit, could be of great practical bene fit to the Union by keeping in order the grass on\nthe proposed bowling green. The corners of the\ngreen could be suitably banked to allow respect able speeds to be attained, and the grass in the\ncentre dealt with by practising some form of bending races. A final problem we leave to our readers; is motor-mowing a Social or an Athletic activity? For the question of whether Club colours are, or\nare not, to be awarded is sure to arise.& i&z \u00a3r&*t> Better Tun* \u00a3*e* Cowmen- BaW- Mines C eaten a fV j dancing to the -n jos ico j Cj \u00abroMo s Embassy CVck.\nN \u00bbte the date:-FRIDAY OCT ZG*11\nOnly 2-9 CoUetfe days Qu kuj MOO-COW SWIM-POOL, London's cleanest swimming pool.( They' ll be flying next '.'.)\nThen of course at last we find it At the bottom, last but one.\nNot too bright, but we don't mind it Safe for twelve more months of fun!
