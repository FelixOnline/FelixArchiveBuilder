Rather than being\nspecifically concerned with apartheid,\nhe explores wider issues of suffering.\nThe films he creates are potent attacks\non contentious aspects of society, particularly with regard to the injustices of\nthe capitalist system. This artist Is not\nafraid to deal with contentious, powerful issues head on and close up. For\nthose turned off by politics, it is quite\npossible to appreciate the work just for\nits vigorous energy.\nThe method employed to prod u ce his graphic portrayals is\nunique. After drawing the first frame\n- with charcoal and sparse use of\npastel colours - he photographs it.\nNext he modifies and reforms the\nimage, blending and erasing. This\nstep by step approach leaves trace\nmarkings of the previous frames,\nshowing the passage of time within\nevery moment. He does not pull any\npunches. Very original, very striking.\nJackson Pollock's frenzied paintings\nare a feast for overactive imaginations. When you squint at the animated swirls, each observer invariably\nforges his own original interpretation.\nDuring the late 1940s, Pollock discarded the conventional brush and laid\nhis canvas down on the studio floor.\nThis radical 'action painting' - the application of paint by pouring and splattering - earned him the nickname 'Jackthe\nDripper'. His eloquent work has been\ndescribed as the visual equivalent of\njazz improvisations.\nCritics revel in psycho-analysing his\ntroubled personal life, marred by self-destructive bouts of depression and\nalcoholism. His untimely death undoubtedly fuelled his icon status. Jackson Pollock is an inspirational, if somewhat\ntortured and intangible figure. The monumental scale of his mature designs is\nat once intimidating and breathtaking;\nvibrant and glorious in the flesh, they\nmust be seen to be believed and\nentirely appreciated.\nSILWK AhJV SYRUP\nVictoria/ avid/AlbertMu&eu wi/ KAMVIbJSKY\nRoyaLAcademy of Arty II lis temporary installation is a show-I case for the V&A's acclaimed 300,000-I strong collection of photographs. Far\nfrom being incoherent, the phenomenal\ndiversity turned out to be a refreshing and\nstimulating asset. The contrasting styles\nand topics range from landscapes to\nabstract compositions, from glamorous\ncelebrity pictures to provocative fashion\nshots. The picture of two students semi-con-s cio us on a sofa after a night at the union\nwill almost certainly conjure up fond mem-or ies. Each skilled composition is brought\nto life by its dynamic texture. \"A photograph\nis not an accident - it is a concept.\"\nSuQcit and Syrup includes images by\na variety of international photographers\nworking between 1845 to 1998, applying\na variety of traditional as well as unconventional techniques. The exhibition\nexplores the evolution of the medium\nthroughout the century in an attempt to\nprove its overwhelming significance as a contemporary form of art. As the author\nEmil Zola explained, \"Our artists have to\nfind the poetry in train stations, the way\ntheir fathers found the poetry in forests\nand rivers.\"\nH Vasily Kandinsky, pioneer of the\nabstract style, was something of a mature prodigy. He abandoned\nan auspicious career in law at the age\nof 29 to study art.\nThe substantial collection of prints,\nsketches, watercolours and gouache s provides a comprehensive overview of\nKandinsky's innovative artistic evolution\nthroughout the 20th century. Initially\ninfluenced by Russian fairytales and religious icons, Kandinsky's folkloric motifs\ngradually evolved towards the intrinsically geometric, non-figurative compositions for which he is renowned.\nBesides being gifted with a photographic memory, Kandinsky was a diagnosed syn aes the sic distinct\nshades of colours stimulated powerful sounds and sensations in his\nbrain.\nThe most fascinating element of\nthe exhibition was the inclusion of a video, showing the artist at work.\nWithin a matter of minutes, a blank\npage was covered in dynamic swirls\nand grids, revealing his swift and\nspontaneous approach to art.\nH UvytCb 30th Hay Untd/ 6th JU Y KJ^ Admission; FREE\nNearest tube: South Kensington\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm Admission: \u00a37.50, concessions \u00a35\nNearest tube: Pimlico\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.40 pm Uattl/August Untd^th July Admission: FREE to students\nNearest tube: South Kensington\nOpening hours: daily 10am5.45 pm( Mondays from 12)\nAdmission: \u00a36, students \u00a34\nNearest tube: Green Park\nOpening hours: daily 10am6 pm( Fri-days in May until 8.30pm) "

This\nwould provide three floors of\nrecreational space, and two\nfloors of residencies - earmarked for visiting academics.\nA large sports hall is planned\nfor the back of the building.\nAlthough those present at\nthe meeting expressed relief\nthat there would be no student accommodation, several\nBy Gareth Morgan\nconcerns were voiced. These included\nless light reaching buildings behind\nthe centre, and noise and light\npollution.\nThe architects have\ntaken pains to ensure that\nthe new buildings will not\nbe out of character with the\narea. Despite this, references to Imperial's less than\nglowing architectural record\nwere made. One speaker\nclaimed that \u00a320 million\nneeded to be spent on \"the\nSouthside monstrosity\", and\nsuggested that the Estates\ndepartment offices should\nbe converted into a sports\ncentre.\nWith the level of opposition evident at the meet-ing, developments seem doomed to become delayed\nby negotiations, revisions\nThe South Kensington Campus prepares to expand upwards and consultations.

If the scheduled\ntests on humans prove successful, a vaccine proficient in halting AIDS\ntransmission could not be too far from\ncoming.\nThe vaccine itself was made from\nharmless fragments of both HIV and\nthe simian version of the virus, SIV. The\nanimal's used in the experiment first\nhad their immune systems primed by\na DNA vaccine. Their bodies were then\nprovoked into Immune responses by\nbooster doses which had been\ninserted into a pox virus. The pox virus\nhowever, did not replicate itself. The\nBy Mansoor Choudhury\nvaccinated monkeys\nwere then tested\nwith large doses of\nHIV. The blood samples of these animals were later found to be totally\nfree of any traces of the virus while the\nun vaccinated control monkeys were\nfound to have up to a billion\nviruses.\nUp till now, AIDS sufferers have\nhad to rely on a combination of drugs\nto combat the effects of the ever-mutating virus. The treatment,\nalthough generally effective in prolonging life, is prohibitively expensive\nfor the vast majority of AIDS-sufferers\nwho live in the Third World. If an effective and cheap vaccine is developed,\nthe number of people being infected\nwith AIDS (currently 16,000 per day)\nshould definitely undergo a massive\ndecrease and HIV could go the way of\nsmallpox. This however, is still a long\nway away.

After\nall, all his best work The Fly,\nVideodrome and Scanners - was produced well over ten years ago, and since then he's consistently been loosing money and raking in some very bad publicity. Consequently, eXist enZ comes to you courtesy of a dozen different arts funds and 'Natural Nylon\nEntertainment' whatever that might be. Suffice to say, it's not exactly the most\nawe-inspiring set of opening credits\nyou've ever seen. The film hasn't even started, and you're already fearing the\nworst...\n...but within five minutes you' re hooked. eXist enZ is probably just as weird as any of his other work, but Cronenberg has recaptured the accessibility\nthat's essential If you want to tell a story\nlike this to an on sci-fi audience. Consequently a story about games run by attaching genetically created ' pods' into\n'bio ports' situated in the base of players\nJennifer Jason Leigh is the future of DoC students? Sadly, I don't think so.\nspines doesn't come across as nearly as\nidiotic as it undoubtedly does from that\nsingle-sentence description. Anyway,\nnone of that's really important, as it's actually a simultaneously scary and funny\nlook at the future of humanity in an increasingly technological world. Paran oia and techno-fear abound, as the\ndivisions between fantasy and reality\nbecome blurred - despite game-play\nstrangely reminiscent of the Commodore64( you have to say one specific line of dialogue, otherwise the characters\nbecome stuck in a loop). The only down side is that in his quest for mass appeal\nhe clearly feels compelled to make the message blindingly clear, and consequently it won't take a PhD in Film to spot\nthe point he' s trying to drive home. The reason it succeeds, however, is\nCronenberg' s sensible decision not to blind us with too much techno-babble.\nInstead, we're carried along by his ability to tell a story on a variety of levels -indeed this is as much an old-fashioned\nlove story (boy and girl brought together\non the run, seemingly with nothing in\ncommon, have to protect each other...)\nas sci-fi or fantasy. He' s ably assisted in\nthis task by the stars, with Jason Leigh in\nparticular bouncing back from some appa ling roles to the kind of sexy, emotive form that brought her to stardom\n(The Hudsucker Proxy and Single White\nFemale).\nStrange it undoubtedly is none the less, and if you're not prepared to be wincing one minute and laughing the\nnext, eXist enZ won't be for you. How ever, if you accept that Cronenberg simply uses weirdness as a tool to tell a story in an engaging way, you'll be rewarded with one of the most thought\nprovoking movies of the year. A definite\nmust for DoC students in need of moral\nguidance.Q Dave\nThe Waterboy * * * \u2022\nStarring : Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Fairuza Balk\nDirector: Frank Coraci\nThe Deep South.- the land that fashion forgot.\nT here are those amongst us who bemoan the triumph of lowest-common denominator comedy as\nthe \"death of modern culture\", and until\nlast summer, I was amongst them. Movies like Kingpin and Dumb &\nDumber have very little going for them besides an endless succession of the kind of gags that make Carry On films\nlook cultured. Last summer, however, I saw There's Something About Mary'and\nmy faith was restored, simply because it\nwas so Goddamn funny. Thankfully,\nThe Waterboy continues the trend, proving that it's possible to make a movie brilliantly funny despite the fact\nthat it expects you to leave your brain at\nthe door.\nIt'san out and out Adam Sandler\nvehicle (sadly Winkler and Balk aren't given enough screen time to make an impact), and it's a credit to his comedic versatility that he manages to make his\nentirely two-dimensional character into a likeable hero. He plays Bobby Boucher,\nac liche ridden southern idiot - a31 year\nold who still lives with his mother (and\nher horse), idol is es professional wrestlers,\nnever went to High School and hits the\npeak of his career as a waterboy for a lowly College team. Or so it would see mun lil he hitches up with Winkler's inept\nsquad, and finds his true calling as the greatest Linebacker in history.\nSure, it's hideously st ero ty pye d, predictable and obvious - but it's incredibly\nentertaining nonetheless. You really root\nfor Sandler, as the modern equivalent of\nthe Am eric an DreamT poor. not particularly bright boy becomes a celebrity\nthrough sport), and he rewards with great\ncomic timing and some top-drawer gags.\nThankfully for prospective UK audie n ces, the sports action requires no knowledge of the rules. Just accept that ,\nevery time Sandler hits someone hard\n(you'll know they're hurt thanks to some unpleasant sound effects) it's A Good Thing, and it'll all make sense. In fact, it's his sporting prowess that provides the\nmost reliable gags, and every time the\nstory seems to be flagging, he'll put in\nanother hilariously effective tackle on the (increasingly petrified) quarterback.\nUltimately, The Waterboy is a one-joke\nfilm - but it's a joke that's delivered in\nenough different disguises to keep you laughing out loud for the regulation\nninety minutes.

As anyone\nwho knows me will tell you, under normal circumstances I would only buy\nthe aforementioned reactionary rag at\ngun-point. But these were definitely\nnot normal circumstances. Had I taken\nleave of my senses? Possibly. Was I in\nthe grip of a ruthless con man? Maybe.\nAm I back in Japan again? Got it in\none, or more accurately in three.

Back in those days, all most of us\nknew about the Japanese was that they\nregularly ate fish containing lethal to x ins, got off on watching dangerously\noverweight men wrestling in the semi-nude, and that every so often their\ncapital city got flattened by a radioactive dinosaur. Thankfully, largely due to\nthe proliferation of affordable sushi\nrestaurants, the growing popularity of\nManga, and the greater availability of\nJapanese beer, we now live in more\nenlightened times. However, there is\nstill a lot to learn about this place that\ncannot simply be gleaned from hanging around Wagamama, watching\nAkira and drinking\na couple of cans of\nSapporo Super Dry.\nMy latest bout\nof re-education\nbegan in the\nKinokuniya Bookshop under Umeda\nstation in downtown Osaka.

Living in a foreign country\ncan be a daunting business at the best\nof times and one of the things that\nhelps the d is orientated ex-pat through\nthe first few tender weeks is being able\nto get one's favourite paper from\nhome. Although I found mine, I could-n't lift my heart high enough to fork out\nthe Y850( \u00a34.50) necessary for its pur-chase. Every leftie has his price and\nmine appears to be Y150, the differ-\"...as they were the\nones in possession of\nthe large, razor-sharp\nknives, I wasn't about to\nar due the toss...\"\nen ce between the cost\nof a four-day-old copy of\nThe Guardian and a similarly superannuated Issue of The Telegraph, which was a snip at Y700. In my (fairly wide) experience of\noverseas living, being an ex-pat is by\nturns a truly wonderful and truly dreadful business. The benefits of living in a country rather than simply passing\nthrough are obvious - however hard\nthey try, Messrs. Thomas Cook and\nFunn Poly can't hope to\nshow you everything.\nOn the other hand,\ntravelling around on a tourist visa at least carries the advantage of\nthe possibility of going\nhome if it all starts to\nget a bit much - not an\noption open to those who have been\nfoolhardy enough to sign up for an\nextended Tour of Duty.\nThe somewhat nebulous concept\nof 'cultural differences' is frequently\nbanded about at this juncture in an\neffort to explain why living in a foreign\ncountry (any one will do, take your\npick) can sometimes be more stressed\nthan blessed. But in the event it is\noften not so much this that makes the\nex-pat feel all at sea. In my case, to\nparaphrase the recent BT commercial\n\"for me it is the little things\" that periodically make me feel like I 've arrived\nfrom another\ndimension through\nMatt Salter\n\"...every leftie\nhas his price, and\na wormhole In the\nspace-time continuum, rather than\noff an All Nippon\nAirways 747 from\nHeathrow. Things\nlike having to\nstump up \u00a34.50 for\na copy of The Gruaniad, things like suddenly finding that\nneeding size 11 shoes qualifies you as\na medical freak, things like having to\npay the equivalent of approximately\n\u00a3380 simply for the privilege of having\na telephone number. However it's not\nall gloom. Living in Japan does have\nmany plus points, for example: 1) food\nso fresh that it frequently arrives at\nyour table still in its death throes, 2) a very low crime rate, 3) beer in vending\nmachines.\nEventually my friend showed up\nand after a bit of mutual back-slapping\nand many a\" hisashi buri desu ne\" (long\ntime no see), he took me off around\ncentral Osaka and showed me the location of such essential facilities as Tower\nRecords and Burger King, before heading off for a late lunch at\na roadside noodle bar\nthat had apparently\nappeared in the gutter overnight. It\nreally was great to see him again, and\nwhile I un dexterously chased some\nramen round in a bowl and out onto\nthe floor we caught up on old times.\nThis activity is a pretty similar procedure\nin Japanese as it is In English, as people graduate and get jobs, get married,\nfather children out of wedlock, and\nhave minor brushes\nwith the law in Japan\njust as much as they\ndo in Britain, except for\nthe fact that they do it\nmine WOUld appear all ln Japanese (double\nback somersault with\ntO be 150 Yen...\" two-and-a half twists -degree of difficulty 3.5).\nNo matter what city one is in, there\nis only so long that one can walk\naround without getting hungry again\nand after several hard hours of milling\nabout aimlessly, we were back on the\nnose bag, this time in a Japanese-style\npub. Such establishments are called\niz a kaya, the Chinese characters for\nwhich can be neatly translated as \"a room where there is alcohol\". My kind\nof joint. My friend had wanted to go for\nnoodles again but I insisted upon this\ntype of restaurant because they are\nreasonably cheap, normally have a good range of alcoholic beverages on\nsale, but above all\nthey serve food\nwhich is relatively\neasy to pickup with\nchopsticks. Even\nbetter than that,\nthere arc lots of\nthings on skewers\nwhich you can just\npop into your\nmouth and remove\nwith your teeth. While this does mean\nthat you run the risk of perforating\nyour ul vu la, at least you don't end up\nscrabbling around trying to pick food\nitems out of your shirt pocket where it\nfell after you jumped out of your skin\nwhen one of the waiters, standing\ndirectly behind you, suddenly bellowed\na greeting to a new customer who has\njust entered the shop. The staff shout\na lot at iz a kay as. They scream a welcome at you when you come through\nthe door, bawl cheerfully when you\nare changing out of your shoes into\nludicrously small slippers and they call\nout the name of every single dish when\nthey bring it to your table. Quite why\nthey feel the need to inform everybody in the room whenever you order\n\"...at \u00a34.20 a pop,\nthis place made \"crazy\nLondon prices\" look\nlike the height of\nreasonableness\nanother beer or a plate of yaki tori( a sort of Japanese chicken satay) escapes\nme, but as they were the ones in possession of the large, razor-sharp knives,\nI wasn't about to argue the toss.\nSeveral hours and many large cups\nof the local sake later, we stumbled out\nof the restaurant with the staff bawling\nout their thanks and entreaties to come\nagain in our wake, and wove our way\ndown the street to another bar, improbably called the Pig and Whistle which\nmy friend proudly informed me was a \"traditional British pub\". And by golly he\nwas right - you might as well have been\nin the Ennismore Arms, a point which\nI am not ashamed to admit brought a tear to my eye. The moistness round\nrims became even more pronounced\nwhen I saw that they were serving real\ndraught Guinness and then turned into\na veritable flood when I realised how\nmuch a pint was going to cost me. At\nY800( \u00a34.20) a pop, this place made\n\"crazy Fondon prices\" look like the\nheight of reasonableness. I must admit\nthat they'd gone out of their way to\ncapture the authentic atmosphere of a British ale house though, right down to\nthe sticky puddles of beer on the bar\nand soggy fag ends in the urinals. As I sank the first of many pints of Pure\nGenius I began to take in my surroundings and for the first time in\nweeks I began to feel at ease. In fact,\nso relaxed was I, that when I was challenged to a game\nof darts, I made little protest and,\nalthough at this\npoint I was on the\npoint of losing the\nability to focus, I felt the spirit of\nJohn Bull well up\nwithin me (or\nmaybe it was heartburn brought on by too much raw\nsquid) and I strode purposefully up to\nthe oc he. I think it is safe to say that by the\ntime I left the Pig and Whistle, the\nJapanese had a radically different view\nof the current state of British darts.\nAnd, regretfully, leave I did. It was time\nto go. As my friend and I staggered out\nof this delightful establishment, I gave\nthe barmaid, who was now looking\nmuch better than she did when I had\ncome in, a Paddington Bear-style hard\nstare and warned her that if she didn't get some Sarah Hughes Dark Ruby by\nthe next time, there just might not be\na next time. However, I don't think she\nbelieved me, and in my heart of hearts,\nnei the t did I. "

It's often an unpredictable event\nbecause it is the first time in the season\nthat university crews meet on a Regatta\n(ie short) course. Moreover, conditions\nare usually windy, and sometimes\nunfair. However, as May 1 st blossomed\ninto an uncharacteristically sunny May\nbank holiday weekend, crews were\nwarming up for the long battle ahead.\nThe first round in the Womens eight category was a hair raising affair.\nThe regatta was running about half an\nhour late, so we decided to arrive at the\nstart in time for this. Unfortunately, due\nto safety problems with our boat we\narrived at the start to see our heat racing off down the course. Swift deliberations with officials secured us a slot in\nthe second heat, because one crew\nhad failed to show. As we slipped onto\nthe start, with a warning for tardiness,\nwe attempted to collect ourselves for\nthe ensuing race.\nA rather sluggish start left us down\non the rest of the field at 500m gone,\nbut we clawed our way back to level\npegging by 250m to go. By now, two\ncrews, Bristol and ourselves, had broken\naway from the rest of the pack. A sprint\nfinish produced what looked, to the\ncasual observer, like a dead heat. We\nwaited with fear and trepidation to hear\nthe final verdict - it came in our favour,\nand we continued to the final as Bristol spat teeth and gunned. for our\nblood. As the day progressed, conditions changed into a raging tailwind,\nand crucial decisions about boat rigging were made. We hardened our\ngearing and hoped the conditions\nstayed the same.\nThe fours final provided useful\ninformation on the changing conditions, and the four finished in silver\nmedal position - a promising result for\nthe all important eight. The final\nloomed and we boated in sufficient\ntime for the race. Again we were down\nat the start but clawed our way back,\nfinishing two seconds ahead of the rest\n(about two-thirds of a boat length).\nThe exalted crew returned home as\nBUSA champions, ready to face the\ncoming season, culminating with Womens Henley in June.\nCompetition\nResults\nAlton Towers Tickets\nThe five lucky correctly placed crosses in\nlast week's 'Spot the Alton Towers' competition came from: Tim Wright, Mark\nJones, Sarah Brown, Jay Heavlsldes &\nAndy Royal, who all spotted that the\ntheme park in question is actually Just a stone's throw from Stoke.

    "content": "10 May 1999 FlIlYI\nReviews & competition\nArtemisia * * *\nStarring : Valentina Cervi, Michel Serrault, Miki Manojlovic\nDirector: Agnes Merlet\nIt's never a particularly good sign\nI when the press release for a new\nI movie explains that it's a biopic of\nsomeone you've never heard of. In this\ncase, it's Artemisia Gentileschi, who was\n(apparently) \"the first significant female\nfigure in western art\". Ever heard of\nher? No, I thought not.\nOn the other hand, the benefit of\nnot having a clue who or what the\nmovie's about is to allow the writer and\ndirector to pretty much make up large\nchunks of the artist's life. Consequently,\nwhether or not this tale of doomed love\nactually bears any relationship to reality\nis somewhat questionable - either way,\nit makes for an engaging story. You see,\nthe young lady in question was a very\ngifted artist, with a tendency to paint\nsubjects considered 'unsuitable' for a young lady at the start of the seventeenth century, who fell in love with her\nteacher - who is then charged with rape\nby the girl's father.\nEffectively, it's the tale of a brilliant\nbut weak willed young girl, trapped\nbetween two forceful men, and forced\nto suffer before she can make good her\nescape. However, Cervi's depiction of\n13\nHow to act In 20 easy lessons.- Number 7 - the love-sick adolescent.\nthe central character doesn't suggest\nany of the strength which a woman\nwould surely need if she were to\nbecome a recognised artist four centuries ago, and the meticulously drawn\nrenaissance style only serves to detract\nfrom any sense of realism which might\nremain. Consequently, as a biopic it's certainly lacking in credibility, but as a textbook tale of doomed love it's effective if uninspired.H Dave\nWin tickets to Forces of Nature with the\nKENSINGTON\nThis week it's the turn of new romantic\ncomedy Forces of Nature to get the\nfree tickets treatment.

As ever, the first ten randomly selected names will take home\nthe prize.\nPDATE\nOut of Sight\nFinally George Clooney breaks into the\nbig-time through yet another brilliant\nElmore Leonard (Get Shorty, Jackie\nBrown) adaptation, which somehow\nmerges old-fashioned caper flick with\nromantic comedy. (George Clooncy is\nthe Cary Grant of the nineties? Hmm,\nmaybe not). Sexy, funny and enthralling,\nit's simply one of the best films of '98,\nthanks to a brilliant combination of perfect acting (from Clooney, Jennifer fop cz and Ving Rhames), a cracking script and\nspot-on direction from Steven Sodcrberg (Sex, Lies and Videotape) - which\nhas catapulted him back into the big-time. If you haven't already seen it, then\ndo so. At once.\nSnake Eyes\nBrian De Palma is undoubtedly a very hit-and-miss director - contrast Scarfacc or\nThe UntouchablcswiXh the dire Bonfire\nof the Vanities - so I guess it shouldn't come as too big a surprise that this is a very hit-and-miss movie. The first half-hour or so is pure brilliance, with some\nincredible stead i cam cinematography\ntaking you through the entire introductory scene in a single (twenty-minute\nlong) shot. Sadly, however, it goes\ndownhill dramatically from there; the\nunmasking of the villain is phenomenally\nobvious, and the finale is plain daft (div-ing out of the way of an oncoming boulder was only ever cool in Indiana Jones).\nWhich is a shame, because underneath\nthere's a really good Nick Cage movie\ntrying to get out.\nElizabeth\nThere are few things that Britain\nundoubtedly does best; snooker, heavy\ndrinking, armchair football, urban\nriots...and costume drama. Fortunately,\nLlizabeth falls into the latter category\n(well, I certainly don't want to sit through\na ninety minute Steve Davis biopic), utilising the key tools of the trade - meticulous attention lo detail, an all-star cast\nand gravity defying bodices - to produce\nan effective but uninspiring addition to\nthe genre. Sadly, despite its supposedly\nrevolutionary approach to the story of\nEngland's young queen, director Kapur\nactually employs a fairly static approach,\nleaving the impression that the movie\ncould have been far better.\nDave\n\n"

However, as soon as these additional beds come on line, the two year\nphased renovation of Southside (cost:\n\u00a314.5 million) and the Weeks project\n(cost: \u00a31.1 million) begin, and then in\nthe summer of 2001 the five year Fvelyn Gardens rolling refurbishment commences (cost: 12.5 million), which will\ntake one hall out of action each year.\nDue to the College's policy that all\nnon-academic areas (sports, residences, catering etc) must break-even,\nthis in turn requires that the College\n\"realise other assets from the Residences portfolio\". In other words, the\nbed spaces in Garden and Brabazon\nHalls will be sold off in summer 2001,\nand Montpelier and Olave Houses will\ndisappear the following July.\nEven greater problems will arise\nin the availability of rooms for what the\nCollege describes as \"priority students\"\n- ie Erasmus students, first year overseas post grads, re-apps, sabbaticals\netc. The sale of the halls already men-tio ned, coupled with a slight increase\nin student numbers means that within\nfive years the College will be faced\nwith a short-fall of at least 200 beds\n(even when the guarantee of a room\nfor all final year medical students is\nwithdrawn).\nHousing Office Stands Firm\nInformation provided by the College's Private Housing Office has raised\ndoubts over last weeks story entitled\n\"Accommodation's Adverse Advice\".\nThe story alleged that a member of\nthe office's staff had recommended a40% increase in rent, from \u00a365 a week\nto \u00a390 a week, to the owner of a property in West Brompton. However, the\nPrivate Housing Officer, Catherine\nJohn, has stated that \"at no time did I mention \u00a390 a week\" as an acceptable rent for the rooms in question.\nShe went on to say that she suggested\nto the landlady that \"I can't see you\nbeing able to achieve anything more\nthan \u00a380 a week for your larger rooms,\nbut for the smaller rooms I would suggest \u00a370-75\". The current rental price\nwas confirmed by a copy of a letter\nfrom the landlady to the Housing\nBy David Roberts\nOffice, confirming final valuations of\n\u00a375 a week for the smaller rooms and\n\u00a380 a week for the medium rooms.\nShe also denied that she had had a conversation with any of the students\nin question, and demonstrated that\nthe property in question has never\nbeen listed at \u00a390 a week\nMrs John explained how she.\napproaches the issue of offering\nadvice on prices, \"my remit has always\nbeen to look after the Imperial students and find them affordable accommodation... if someone asks me for a professional opinion I will give my\nopinion - it's not my advice, it's my\nopinion of what can be achieved\". She\nalso explained that she is increasingly\nlooking to vet properties before they\nare put onto College lists, which will\nbring to an end one of the most frequently cited problems with the.\nservice.\nThe students concerned in the allegations were unavailable for comment\nthis week, due to examinations. However, a further update will appear later\nthis term, which will hopefully produce a consensus of opinion from the\ntwo sides involved.\nUntil then Felix would like to apologise to any individuals who felt they\nwere misrepresented.

    "content": "14 Music 10 May 1999\nAlbums\nULTRASOUND\nEverything; Picture [\nOne these people Is pregnant, who\nneeds the ultrasound?\nY ou'll either love it or hate it. It's rock with a twist and it won't be\nto everyones liking. It's music for\nthe indie kids who are angry with every-one and everything. Play it loud and it'll\nblow you away. Play it soft and it'll just\ndepress you. Everything Picture is Ultrasound's debut album that comprises of two CD's yet only 11 tracks. The reason for the\ndouble CD? I don't know but it's kind of fun and I like it. The fact that the songs on this 88-minute masterpiece are\nsegued together with \"incidental music\"\nis a tad irritating at times but you soon get used to it. If you don't know the band\nthen the words\" bloat er\" and\" pork er\" might jog your memory into re mem bering who they are as they describe\nfront man Andrew Wood to aT. If I say\nthe words 'Independent' and 'The', your\nmemory might be jogged even further\nas the band were recently featured as\nfront page news for doing something which, in my opinion, is so obviously a publicity stunt it's untrue. \"Tiny\", as Wood is affectionately referred to by the rest of the world, caused controversy at a Red\nor Dead fashion show when he lifted the\ndress (??) he was wearing to reveal the word' unique' scrawled across his s to mach as two of his fellow band members streaked across the catwalk. It's things\nlike this that make me think Ultrasound\nare just a bit too desperate to make it big.\nThis comes across very strongly in their\nlyrics and quotes, which are meant to be\nprofound, but arc actually quite stupid.\nHang on though, maybe I'm missing the\npoint and am taking them too seriously.\nThey're fun and are in love with them selves- there's nothing wrong with thai.\nTheir first single was a Gregorian terrace\nanthem...need I say more?\nfour of the songs on the album have been singles with Floodlit World\nbeing the most successful in reaching\nthe top30. Stay Young is brilliant with\nWoods' powerful, if ever so slightly\nannoying voice, making adrenaline levels rise and hairs stand on end. Combining both complex and dumb lyrics\nthis song illustrates to me what the band are all about. The song is full of weird references to Gary Glitter as well as the normal teenage angst stuff. It's a song for\nunder a ge drinkers and behind the bike-shed smokers who hate living with their\nparents.\nImpossible Dream is perfect and I love it. It has everything you could ever\nwant In a song and more. It's a mixture\nof mellow words, loud choruses and strange samples that'll ma ke you want to\njump around a lot- making sure the curtains are closed first so noone can see\nyou.\nfor a band who say they only ever\nwanted to \"turn the world on\", they're\ngoing the right way about it. It's been said that they have 'reached the kind of soul fanfare peak of salvation rock that\nmost bands spend a lifetime building up\nto'. Whether this Is true or not I can't decide but as I said earlier, you'll either\nlove it or hate it. I don't hate it so I guess\nthat means I love it.CI\nIngrid\nNAUGHTY BY NATURE\nNature's Finest\nNaughty by name.\nNaughty By Nature.\nNew material is on the way but\nyour profile isn't what it used\nto be, so what are you going to\ndo? Is it (a) release a greatest hits compilation,( b) release a greatest hits compilation or (c) get caught in a public toilet putting your tackle out on offer? The\nusual course of action is the first two options, the third less favoured but just\nas useful so it seems. Naughty by Nature arrived, via the\nfar from cool zoot-suited New Style, in\nthe late '80s/ early '90s at a time when Hip-Hop had reached its zenith: amongst\nothers, Public Enemy were combining fierce political/social comment with the Bomb Squad's sonic experimentation,\nDe La Soul had plug-tuned us into the\nDaisy Age with wit-laden-sample-fests,\nRakim was producing raps of poetic beauty over Eric B's breakbeat s and the Flavor Unit were in full effect. There was the versatile soulful raps of Queen Latifah, the dexterous riff in' of Lakim\nShabazz and then there was Naughty By\nNature. All of the former were credible\nbut were the latter? Well yes and no, their\nstyle being polymorphic, marrying lyrics\nof serious insight and ear-hemorrhaging\nbasslines with melodic choruses and slick R&B dynamics, conjures up a mixed\nbag. Taking a Bob Marley riff and coupling it with penitent lyrics about a lost\nchildhood produced the massive Everything's Going To Be Alright. Hip Hip\nHooray exemplifies Nature's knack of producing compelling chant-along\nanthems. However, something strange\nhappened to soul/R&B music in the late\n'80s. Inventive, impress i ble tunes were replaced by torpid mush; the ground breaking, spine tingling songs of the Motown, Atlantic and Stax record labels\nin the'60 s/'70 s were succeeded by the inane tuneless pulp of R Kelly and his\nlike. Vintage soul classics were Aryanised\nand murdered by Celine, Mariah etc.\nThe phenomenon even dragged its fetid\ncorpse into Hip-Hop, Nature's Penetration being a particularly unpalatable example of meandering lushness.\nStill, at their most focused the boys\nhave the talent to come up trumps, the\nirresistible OPP being a case in point.\n'You down with OPP?' chant the group,\n'Yeah, you know mcl' I retort as I jump with wild abandon on my bed, eventhough I haven't got a bloody clue what OPP stands for. However, all things must\npass and my Ma banging on my bedroom door threatening to revoke my\nafternoon treat of Jam my Dodgers and Tizer soon puts pay to such frivolity. So,\nan album that is certainly Nature's finest\nbut you're going to have to buy a Public Enemy collection for Hip-Hop's finest.\nEH Chris\n\n"

For those who like throwing their legs round huge throbbing motors, the taste of hospital food and the\nfeel of metal In very close contact with\ntheir bones very very close contact.\nShort of volunteering for the British\nmanned space flight program though there are very few other ways to get to\ngo from 0-60 mph in less than 5 seconds on a budget of less than ten thousand pounds( well there is always car jacking\nbut just for once lets keep to the straight\nand narrow).\nSo with the fast, furious and exciting\naction that bikes provide, why are there\nso few good motorcycle racing games about? Sega had a winner at the arcades\nwith Manx TT but not many can afford a full size arcade racer in the average student flat. Perhaps the problem is the control method. Car racers have their fill\nof ready to run steering wheels feed back or no feedback, but till now noone seems willing to build a full size\nreplica ducat i in plastic to lean\ninto the corners and practice\nthose all important reverse steer-ng manoeuvres. So with either\n||j joystick or keyboard controlled\nBS games perhaps motorcycle \u2022 games were doomed to be more 'arcade and fun' like road-rash rather than the more serious\ncar racing games like Gran\nTourismo.\nEA though has taken the risk\nand tried to produce a more grown up\nmotorcycle game. Based on the more beefier superbike series rather than the\nhalf litre 2 stroke madness known as\nGrand Prix bike racing, the game echoes the Formula one style of car games rather\nthan the more open play of the Gran\nTourism o series, for this sin It more than\ncompensates with a level of detail and control which is just completely breath-taking.\nThere is\nan arcade racing style,\nand while being fun and good for dipping the toe in\nonce and a while, while also useful for learning\nhow to handle the bike, it is the poppo dom and chutney of the main madras\nmeal. The real fun begins when the\nsimulation mode is chosen. Here you jump on one of the\nhottest bikes known to man and attempt to race the thing against 4fl fB competition. The usual rounds c practice, qualification and practice again\nstill figure in. there but the true angel\ndelight is how the bike handles. The ability to high and low side the bike - crash\nin spectacular ways to those not in the\nknow is excellent; for once a designer\nhas realised that a bike does not follow the same handling physics as half a car.\nOpen the throttle up suddenly too soon in a corner and the back wheel will loose\ngrip and those nice new leathers the\nsponsors so kindly donated suddenly become gravel fodder.\nStart this game on a nice new fast\nmachine with a good card and kick the\ngraphics level\nup to its highest\nand you will\nstart to feel the\ngravel rash\nfrom the crashes too. With the camera\nangle from either above or\njust behind the\nbike the quality\nand speed of the graphics is superb, but the best view-ing, if not the most easy to control from,\nis the helmet view. In this the head bobbles about when cornering and it\nbecomes a fight not to start leaning into\nthe corners in sympathy.\nThe force feedback joystick is also\ncatered for in this bikers heaven and short of a full sized replica it will have to\ndo as the control method of choice -though it does make the game harder to\nplay, and to prevent permanent nerve\nand muscle damage perhaps there\nshould be a warning to turn the reaction\nsettings down to a minimum. The motorcycle game has, with EA\nSuperbike World Championship, finally\ngrown up. If only there were people to\nmake replica bikes for the bedrooms, or\neven wire up real superbike son a stand\nand equip the computer with a set of VR\ngoggles. Then perhaps it would be possible to convert people to the dangerous\nworld of two wheels good, four wheels bad. With EA Superbike challenge the\ngame is no longer the problem, it has\ncome of age. Grand Theft Auto - Mission Pack 1 : London 1969 (PC)\ni A lifetime\nand a half\nago the\ngame Grand\nTheft Auto whipped up controversy among hundreds of Express readers all\nover the home counties. A game based on robbery, murder and drugs was never\ngoing to be a favourite among that\ncrowd, presumably because of the fact\nthat the game relied on driving on the\nright and they only did that while on the\nway down to the Bordeaux holiday cot-t age. Luckily for these people the exp an sion pack GTA - London, takes you away from the rough and tumble of the states\nand into the gun and bomb ridden swinging London of the1960' s. Who says things are getting more violent.\nNotice I said expansion pack. You still\nneed the original to be installed on the PC to be able to play. Though with GTA2 on its way, someone surely is just about\nto relaunch the original version in bud get format. Your extra money does get\nyou a whole multi-storey carpark of new cars to steal, with scooters and mopeds for the two wheel fiends. The names of these cars follow the original 'we don't particularly want a large writ from General Motors or Ford' technique. The old\nJugular (Jaguar), now get mixed in with\nthe Crapi (Capri). While driving fast cars\nthrough the streets of London is fun, the destruction derby only really begins\nwhen running amok driving a petrol\ntanker, routemaster bus, or even more fun the open top tourist bus and on your left is a crumpled fiat 500 and on the right is a police car attempting to road\nblock us.\nThe game follows the same structure\nand keeps the excellent\npay ability of the US ver-sion. After a rather simple\ntheft of little johnny' s scooter for one of the big\nbosses you attempt to\ncomplete a series of missions and carjack your way round the streets of London to progress\nto the next level of more and more difficult and interesting missions.\nDid I mention mission? What I should\nhave said is job as in bank job, blok e job even bomb jobs (they might have something to do with blowing things up but\neven these pages are not going to sink\nto that level.). The game structure might\nwell be the same as GTA - US but the\njobs, the voices and the cut sequences are all Michael Caine 1960's Film style\nwide boy. Even the police have developed accents that would have sat rather\nnicely between the frames of the Italian\nJob. A John Barry soundtrack in the back-ground would almost be too retro - and perhaps thankfully there is the steady\nstream of1960' s radio style tracks that\naccompany your crime\nspree.\nUnfortunately as\nmuch as they have tried, this is a London that noone south of Watford will recognise.\nThere might be a Hyde\npark and \u2022HHHHHj\nWestmin- \u00ab \u2022\nster, but\nthe American grid\nsystem of the original has transformed the streets into a series of\nareas connected by nice and simple north-south and east-west roads.\nBut hey this is make believe film\nfond on not the real place. In the real\nworld there is never the excitement of\ngangland killings in Chelsea using flamethrowers or attacks on the QPR team bus with a rocket launcher - though i know a few fans wouldn't mind as long\nas the insurance bought some better\nplayers. Also the excitement of a fast\nchase through the streets of London somehow is lost when you have to fight\nthrough the gridlock on the A40 on a Friday night. It's a barrel of monkeys gu v'and well worth popping up west and treating yourself to some violence and robbery treacle., err readers.\n\n"

    "content": "10 May 1999 News\nCannabis Comes to the Common The International Cannabis Coalition's march, held in South London on Saturday\nMay 1, has been heralded as a success. A gathering of protesters, supporting the\nlegal is ation of cannabis, joined other\nmarchers in London as traditional bank\nholiday demonstrations took place around\nthe capital.\nDemonstrators gathered on Rush\nCommon in Brixton late on Saturday morn-ing. At the same time a protest organised\nby the anti-Nazi league began marching its\nway from Brixton to central London, in a demonstration against the nail-bombings\nof recent weeks. Indeed, it had been\nrumoured that the cannabis march may\nitself be a target of the bombers. Superintendent David George, who headed the\npolice operation surrounding the march,\nconfirmed that the route was indeed\nchecked for explosive devices during the\nmorning; \"we had to treat very seriously the\nsafety of policemen and the public\" he\nexplained.\nAs it was the 3000 strong crowd left\nRush Common on schedule at 12.30pm, heading for Clapham Common. The mood\nwas happy and peaceful and, although\nthere was little evidence of a real campaign\nin progress, both organisers and police\nwere satisfied by the outcome. A sound system led the march for much of the way,\nBy Ed Sexton\nentertaining and inciting the crowd,\nbecoming silent as it passed Electric\nAvenue, the site of the Brixton bomb.\nBy the time they entered Clapham\nCommon for what was to become a long\nafternoon festival, the crowds had swelled\nto an estimated 5000, although police\nsources mentioned 8000. The common\nwas filled with sound systems, stalls, music\ntents and speakers. The 'cannabis festival'\nwas the highlight of the day, although for\nmany this simply meant the ability to break\nthe law in public. The organisers saw the\nevent as a success, however, as it demonstrated that \"grass root action\" can be as\neffective as national media campaigns,\nsuch as that organised by the Independent\non Sunday last year.\nHoward Marks, the famous former\ndrugs-smuggler turned writer, spoke at the\nfestival. Defending his view, he claimed\nthat two thirds of all British voters under 25\nyears old take cannabis. He summed up his\nview of New Labour in one sentence,- \"This\ngovernment stupidly forces itself to lie and\narrogantly disapproves of the recreational\nput suits of millions of really good people.\"\nBack in the crowds sprawled on the\ngrass the mood was jubilant. No arrests\nwere made and there were no incidents;\nsuperintendent David Geotge said he was\n\"very happy\" with how the event pro-gres sed. Protesters, mostly stoned, agreed;\n\"I think it's been very peaceful\" commented\none. When asked why they were at the\nmarch, two young men replied \"to support\nit, and because we smoke a lot of weed\".\nFew of those enjoying the afternoon sun\nseemed to think the festival would have\nany political consequences, however.\nDanny Kushlick, spokesman for Transform,\nwho campaign for drug policy reform,\nagreed; \"I don't know whether rallies like\nthis actually change anything, and we are\ndeluding ourselves if we think that they\ndo\".\nThe festival was due to end at 8.30pm, It was a warm evening, however, and\nmany stayed on until much later. This did\nnot bother the authorities, though; David\nGeorge sym pathis ed with those that\nstayed; \"it was a nice evening, so understandably some people stayed until 11pm, and so we obviously stayed with them.\"\n\n"

    "content": "II\nScience 10 May 1999\nNew Scientists Lyndsey Clark Examines The New Face Of Science Fiction\nMi\ny faith in contemporary cinema has been restored! - The Faculty. All the self-reflexive,\nI postmodernist irony of Scream, the A meri can high school ideology of the 80s, and it's Sci-Fi too! What more could you want in a film?\nI must confess here to being slightly biased on account of the fact that Iam a self-confessed Sci-Fi\nnut. I'm sure there are plenty of you sympathisers out\nthere but, let's face it, IC Is a pretty unique place in\nsome respects. With The Faculty something truly\namazing has happened Sci-fi has become cool. Not' Cool' like Babylon 5 or New Labour, but really cool like Urban Sportswear or 'Utility Chic'. Like most Science Fiction, of course there isn'ta scientist to be found in The Faculty. And of course it's the kids who save the day( their knowledge gleaned from sci-fi movies of the past). But even when films have scientists in them, something has\nchanged recently. Just when we were getting used to some nice, comfortably predictable, stereotypes, there springs a new breed of movie scientist. Some people think these representations of scientists and science in popular culture could actually affect our\nchoice of career and whether to become 'real' scientists or not. So what is this image that's supposed to be penetrating our subconscious? Classic narrative tension in the pull between character driven stories and plot driven ones has\nalways been glaringly apparent in Sci-Fi. We either get\ngood rounded characters and really predictable plots,\nlike the Frankenstein thing in Jurassic Park or the classic invasion in Independence Day. Or we get good and original stories but with flat and lifeless characters. The former approach, concentrating on char-act er, is a more recent phenomena. Our new breed of scientific hero is a complex creature, reflecting its\nlineage as much as it rebels against It. It is natural that\nSci-Fi and the scientists we find there evolve as sci-en ce advances and our society's attitudes change. After the ups and downs of the discovery and use of\nnuclear weapons, scientists suffered some really bad press. But, to our post Cold War generation, the physicists have become somewhat impotent. Power, we know, lies in the hands of governments and not\nscientists. Heroism has come to be associated with the suppression rather than the use of new knowledge. Our hero scientist is a rebel and maverick who rejects the scientific and political institutions to\ndo what he (or why not even 'she'?) thinks is best.\nThe scientist is now more human and is neither inherently good nor evil, so there is more scope for\nrounded character is ation in Sci-fi.\nScience Fiction, as a genre, has been forced to change in the late 1990s. We have already sent men into space, found no little green invaders on Mars, released the power of the atom, and cloned living\nmammals. As we fast approach the21 st century our\nimaginations have turned away from dreams about the science of the future. Modern films tend to be set in the present day with technology we can easily conceive as existing already or in the very near\nfuture. This is why we see a move away from story\ndriven plots and towards character driven ones. Two rather interesting recent examples are Jurassic Park\nand Independence Day.\nOne of the most interesting things about Jurassic Park is that, although the geneticists are the bad guys, there are other characters who are also scientists. Palaeontologists have always been pretty cool by virtue of the fact that dinosaurs are cool, but the\nmost Interesting character has to be Dr Ian Malcom. As the chaos mathematician, Jeff Go id blum plays Malcom without any of the usual stereotypes of mathematics. While the geneticists forge carelessly ahead with no thought for the consequences of meddling with nature, Malcom advocates caution and respect\nfor the natural order of things. Independence Day presents a traditional model of the Sci-Fi film, with the three heroes representing government, military and science. The scientist in\nquestion is again played by Jeff Goldblum and displays all the required characteristics of the new sci-ent is t.He rides a bike in order to save the environment( did we all appreciate the irony in the\nfact that he encounters some inconvenience in saving the world because he doesn't have a car?), he\nobsessively recycles and preaches at others to do the\nsame. He is the one who is vehemently against the\nuse of nuclear weapons while the president and military arc keen. This is not an uncommon counter re ac tion to the idea that scientists arca moral and ruined mankind by giving us the power of knowledge in the first place. Now that the power and control of\nnuclear weapons has passed out of the hands of the\nscientists, we increasingly see scientists as the characters who are aware of the consequences and try\nto encourage restraint.\nBut this is all an aside really. What we want to\nknow is what effects all this might have on us young and impressionable characters starting out in the\nworld of science. Ar ewe all being subliminally brain-washed into scientific careers, by the whims and fancies of popular culture? Personally, I think it's probably\ntoo early to tell. We, after all, are children of the eighties and chose to start down the track to a science career before this new breed of super sensitive scientist was born. But next time you go home, listen\nto what your little brother or sister is saying you could be witnessing the birth of a new generation of\nscientist.\n\n"

Television cameras\ninstalled in Lecture Theatre One in the\nBMS building as part of the School of\nMedicine's new Interactive video teaching system have been found another\nuse. Sneaky staff are spying on the\nwannabe doctors' behaviour during lec-ture s. This covert operation is the Medical School's response to harmless but\nchildish behaviour of some of the\nwannabe doctors. Medics are renowned\nfor their exuberant and flamboyant and\ngenerally over the top reactions to lec-ture s, regularly applauding excellent lec-ture s, and explicitly ignoring boring ones.\nEvidently the bigwigs in the medical\nschool on hearing of this have decided\nto clamp down. Students have been\nwarned that the videos will be watched,\nand perpetrators Identified if a lecturer\ncomplains of \"bad behaviour\" during\ntheir lectures. Kevin hopes that even\nthough this is only affecting first year\nmedics at the moment, the Medical\nUnion will strongly oppose this action.\nMicrosoft Megalomania\nWe can relax in the knowledge that every\nsingle e mail system in use here at the MIT\nof Europe, is a lot better than the archaic\ntext only e mail system\navailable to students\nat Oxford. The IC email system is undergoing a period of\nchange, with the trend\nbeing towards the use\nof Microsoft Exchange\nservers, and Microsoft\nOutlook. Some people appear to be quite\nhappy to assist In\nincreasing Bill Gate's fortunes even more\nby using Microsoft products. However\nthis view is far from universal, as within the\nIC community we also have people who\nobject to the use of Outlook, people such\nas Apple Mac evangelists like Kevin, penguin lovers, and plain lud d ites with a fond attachment to PINE, all have understandable objections to this forced\nchange. The fact that the change has\nbeen made by force is undeniable, Kevin\nA Mostly Harmless Column by\nKevin, a random entity who\nknows nothing about nothing\nis aware of instances where students have\nbeen issued with Outlook accounts, and\nthe CCS refuses to provide the necessary\ninformation to allow them to use other\nmail programs.\nTime Control\nWhilst investigating the\nstrange behaviour of\nthe clocks in the\nphysics building, Kevin\nhas made an interesting discovery. All clocks\nof any significance\nwithin IC, including\nthose behind the bars\nin the union, are controlled centrally from\nSherfield. I fear this is only part of an\nescalating attempt for complete control.\nIt was only recently reported in IC Distorter\nthat control of heating systems will be\nhanded over and controlled by a central\ncomputer. Let's hope they get it right,\nand we no longer find world class Linux\nobsessed materials scientists asking:\n\"When is the IC heating going to be\nadjusted to the current mild conditions so\nI don't have to don beach wear to be\ncomfortable in my office?\" Evidence of\ncontrol at a more supreme level can be\nseen on Level Five, the location of the Rector's suite, where there is a switch which\nappears to select between the seasons\nsummer and winter.\nFish Tank Foible\nWe, as students, are quite rightly very critical of some of the college's outrageous\nspending on items such as the infamous\nimported granite, and six figure sums\nspent on flower beds. I am waiting to see\nwhat reaction there will be to the proposed spending of three to five hundred\npounds by ICU on a Fish tank! Kevin would\nquite happily direct them to some very life-like, and relaxing screen savers, which\ncan do a reasonable job of simulating fish,\nwhich are a lot cheaper and a lot less has-s le, and if intelligently used could give an\nequally \"fantastic\" result, and without the\nhigh maintenance costs of live fish.\nSend ideas and contributions to\nkevin_ mishmash@ hotmail.com\nPresidential Talk-Back\nf Felix are short of news or want to\nwind up some people, a headline\nabout sports\nfields isn't too far\naway. Although the\nCapital Investment\nPlan does allocate \u00a33\nmillion to the sports\ncentre from a ratio-nal is ation of College\nsports fields, to draw\nany conclusions as to\nwhat may happen is\npurely reactionary.\nThe attitude of a lot\nof students I have\nspoken suggests that\nthey think whoever\nshouts the loudest,\n'don't sell our\nground, sell theirs, because we play here'\nwill retain their preferred sports ground.\nThankfully I believe the issue will come\ndown to what is best for student sport\nand not politics, for this Frank Murray's view of a new ground closer to College\nwould be ideal.\nElections are upon us.
