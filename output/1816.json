    "content": "Last term saw growing discontent\nwith Imperial Athletes, the main\nadministrative body for all sports sector\nsocieties.\nMove Imperial consists of the\nCollege\u2019ssportsadministrationstaff,and\nImperial Athletes (IA) was an initiative\ndesigned to act as a bridge between the\nUnion and Move Imperial. IA was first\nlaunched in 2020/21. IA was launched\nin a year plagued by the pandemic and\nits resulting restrictions, but it has\nproved unpopular for another reason:\nclubs have told Felix that often, the staff\nmake running societies more difficult\nthan should be.\nThis year in particular, frustration at\nImperial Athletes has been snowballing\ndue to frequent miscommunication\nand inconsistency in their polices. It\nwas made clear to Felix that these\ncommunication problems are not\nlimited to the last year.\nImperial Table Tennis qualified\nfor the European Championships in\nSpring last year, and a member reported\nthat IA had said they were unable to\ngo. Imperial Athletes had told BUCS\n(British University & Colleges Sport)\nat the beginning of the academic year\nthat \u2013 were Table Tennis to qualify \u2013\nImperial College would not be sending\nthem due to budget constrictions. This\nwas not communicated to Table Tennis\nat the time.\nTable Tennis disputed the decision,\narguingthatitwasaclubdecision.Atthis\npoint, Imperial Athletes incorrectly told\nthem that they had missed the deadline\nto enter anyway. Then, Table Tennis got\nin direct contact with BUCS. BUCS\nnormally requests students refrain from\ndoing so, to minimise disruption to\nBUCS offices. IA normally acts as a go-between.\nTable Tennis were able to enter, and\nEathquakes in London\n- can Imperial do\nbetter than humanities\nstudents?? >p7\nISSUE 1816\nFounded 1949\nFRIDAY 6TH JANUARY 2023\nFelix@ic.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nFelix\nIC Sport at risk - rising\ndiscontent at Move Imperial\nIsabella Ward News Writer\nContinued on page 3...\nMove Imperial started an initiative with ICU called Imperial Athletes to support Imperial sports in London, national, and international leagues\nImperial Athletes provided over \u00a31800\ntowards the competition, in addition\nto \u00a3289.90 the club received from the\nUnion though an Activity Development\nFund bid.\nImperial Athletes experienced many\nchanges in the last academic year\nincluding a structural overhaul to their\nfinancial model, through the work of\nthe previous Deputy President (Clubs\nand Societies) and Athletic Clubs\nCommittee (ACC) Chairs, supported\nby the Union. It was expected that the\nnew structure would have teething\nissues. However, clubs have been \u201cmost\nfrustrated by miscommunication,\ninconsistency, and lack of transparency\nfrom Imperial Athletes.\u201d\nThe administration and funding for\ntransport to matches has also undergone\na dramatic change. Last year, all\ntransport was arranged and funded by\nImperial Athletes. This year, clubs were\ntold that all transport costs would have\nto be covered by individual club funds,\nbut that Imperial Athletes staff would\nstill aid the organisation of transport for\nBUCS fixtures outside of Zone 6 unless\na club opted out of this.\nThis policy worked well for clubs at\nthe start of the academic year. However,\nclubsweresurprisedoncertainoccasions\nwhen, on contacting Imperial Athletes\nto inquire about transport arrangements\nforupcomingmatches,ImperialAthletes\nresponded saying that they had made no\nsuch preparations. This left clubs having\nto book last minute train tickets for\nwhole squads, at significant cost.\nWhen clubs asked for further\nclarification,ImperialAthletesexplained\ntheir policy: only when it is cheaper\nto book a coach than to book train\ntickets will they assist with transport\narrangements.\nAdmittedly, Imperial Athletes did\nhint at this possibility when they\nupdated their transport policy in July,\nstatinginanemailtoallmembers\u201cInthe\ninterest of full transparency, it should be\nnoted that operating even a minimum\nservice of transport is dependent on\na certain number of clubs utilising it.\nShould usage fall below this threshold,\nwe may have to review its longer-term\nsustainability.\u201d\nHowever, clubs feel that there has\nnot been \u2018full transparency\u2019 as it was\nnot understood that this was something\nImperial Athletes would use to justify\ntheir transport policy on a weekly basis,\nand not singularly in \u2018longer-term\u2019 as\nthey claimed.\nThe timeliness of IA\u2019s decisions have\nbeenaparticularissue:clubscommented\nhow, whilst perhaps when staff research\nthe train tickets they are indeed cheaper\nthan the bus, by the time the club is\nnotified that they are not being assisted\nwith transport arrangements, this is not\nthe case.\nIC Rugby were told to organise their\nown transport only two days in advance\nand, faced with the prospect of spending\n\u00a31200 on train tickets, had to concede\nthe match.

    "content": "Unions in the United Kingdom have\nalonghistory,andhaverepresentedthe\ninterests of the working population,\nand advocated for fair treatment.\nThey have not had an easy\npath - when trade unions were\ndecriminalised in 1867,\nunions began forming,\nand smaller unions\ncombined to form the\nTrade Union Movement\nat the start of the Industrial\nrevolution, which\nworked to improve\nworking conditions\nand wages for men\nin different industries.\nThis was the founding\nbasis of the Labour Party.\nConservative governments in\n1979-1997 oversaw the rise in anti-union laws: requiring ballots to\nstrike, a requirement that they exceed\n50%, restricting the right to picket,\nbringing members to support other\nunions, and the institution of fines.\nAccording to the Trades Union\nCongress, unionized workers in the\nUK earn an average of 10.8% more\nthan non-unionized workers. Unions\nare the reason there are pensions,\nworkplace injury compensation,\nholiday leave, parental leave, a 40-hour\nwork week, and a minimum wage. Not\nto mention - no more child labour.\nIn the last few months, the UK has\nexperienced strikes by public sector\nemployees not seen in the last 30 years.\nWe saw the biggest nursing strike in\nNHShistory,andarestillexperiencing\nrail strikes as the College returns\nfrom the Winter Break. Ambulance\nworkers, the Postal Service, Civil\nService, bus drivers, and school\nteachers. The Prime Minister was set\nto institute new laws to limit strike\naction, and the government appears\nto be resolute in not talking to unions.\nIt is important to note that while\nunions generally work to represent\nthe interests of workers and advocate\nfor fair treatment in the\nworkplace, there have\nbeen instances where\nunions have not acted\nin the best interests\nof their members.\nAn example is\nwhen unions engage\nin strike action that is\ndisruptive to the public\nor causes undue hardship\nfor the workers themselves.\nWhile striking, workers do not\ncollect pay - this can put financial\npressure on those who need unions the\nmost. While the right to strike is an\nimportant tool for workers to use in\nnegotiating for fair treatment, strikes\ncan also have negative consequences\nfor workers who may lose pay or\nface backlash from their employers.\nAs a large organisation reflecting\nthe interests of many, unions may\nsometimes make decisions that are\nnot favourable for all, for example,\nwhen negotiating pay or benefits.\nImperial\u2019s Constituent Unions\nformed in the late 1880s and 1890s.\nThe Imperial College Union itself was\nestablished in 1910. As the students\u2019\nunion, ICU acts in the best interests\nof students, advocating on their behalf\nwhen they face trouble. The ICU\nmanages and oversees the activities\nof over 300 clubs and societies at\nImperial, and students should do well\nto remember that they are a students\u2019\nunion,runforstudentsandbystudents.\n2\nJamie John\nDeputyEditor\nandChiefSci-enceEditor\nSam Lovatt\nManaging\nEditor\nIsabella Ward NewsWriter\nSophie Reck\nPointon\nArtsWriter\nThis issue was produced\nthanks to the work of\nAnd our numerous\ncontributors\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nUnions work for the many\nFelix Office\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road\nLondon, SW7 2BB\nTel: 020 79548072\nEmail: felix@ic.ac.uk\nfelixonline.co.uk\n@feliximperial\nPrinted by Iliffe Media\nWinship Road,\nMilton,Cambridge\nCB24 6PP\nRegistered Newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright (c) Felix 2020\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

This was the guidance set by\nBUCS when Imperial Athletes liaised\ndirectly with BUCS on the matter, but\nonly if no other solution could be found.\nThe club did not feel any attempt had\nbeen made to find another solution, and\nit was fortunate that the planned train\nstrikes were ultimately called off and\nthat the fixtures went ahead as planned.\nIn addition to administration,\nMove Imperial \u201coffer tailored support\nto \u2018Performance level\u2019 clubs\u201d: clubs\nperforming at the top tiers of the BUCS\nleagues.\nIC Squash, despite having both their\nmen\u2019s and women\u2019s squads competing\nin the first division of their respective\nleagues, initially had their access to\nstrength and conditioning sessions\ncut, and have been dropped from the\nPerformance Programme, according to\na member. Move Imperial\u2019s website still\nlists this club as a performance sport\nwhom they support.\nWhilst societies have requested that\na Move Imperial representative attends\nthe next general sports sector meeting\nto address Move Imperial directly, they\nhave been told that it is \u2018unlikely\u2019 . It\nis unclear if this is a Move Imperial, or\nUnion decision. Even if student leaders\nwere able to voice their concerns,\nmany doubt it would change anything.\nOne club president told me \u201cMove\nImperial have always acknowledged\ntheir failures to us when committees\nhave complained, but they have never\nchanged anything\u201d, adding \u201cOr, where\nchanges have been made, they have only\nbeen to our detriment.\u201d\nWhen a senior sports administrator\nexited their position in November,\nseveralclubsjokedthat,suchwasthelack\nof help they are receiving already, being\nleft in limbo may not be any different to\ntheir experience so far this term anyway.\nA new sports administrator will be\njoining the team in early 2023.\nA Move Imperial spokesperson said:\n\u201cImperial Athletes is a collaboration\nbetween the Imperial College Union\nand Move Imperial. We together\nrecognisethattherehavebeencontinued\ndifficulties in the past 4 months, not\nleast around the administration of\nfunding and transport. The changes to\nthe funding model were proposed by\nthe previous DPCS and approved by\nthe ICU Council; Imperial Athletes\nwere then charged with operationalising\nthis new model. It has undoubtedly\nbrought challenges; nonetheless, we are\ncommitted to working with clubs to\nconstructively find ways to improve the\noverall experience.\u201d\nImperial Athletes boast on Instagram\nthat Imperial is the most successful\nLondon University in BUCS. But if\ntheir administrative and communicative\nerrorscontinueatclubs\u2019detriment,there\nis a threat that this may not hold true for\nmuch longer.\nReaders should note that Felix spoke\nto members in multiple sports societies\nto gather information about their\nexperiences.

The\nloop must pass through the dots, and the number of lines that\ntouch a given dot must match the number written in that cell.\nHere are the basic rules of Slitherlink:\n1. Connect the dots with vertical or horizontal lines to form a\nsingle loop.\n2. The loop must pass through all of the dots and must not\ncross itself or branch off in multiple directions.\n3. The number of lines touching a dot must match the number\nwritten in that cell. For example, if a cell contains the number\n\u201c2\u201d, there must be exactly two lines touching that dot.\nNo two lines can intersect, except at a dot.\nThe puzzle is solved when all of the dots have been connected\nin a way that satisfies all of the above rules.\nHint: Not all the dots in the top left corner are used in the\nloop.\n\n"

Interestingly, there was a lot of\noverlapbetweenthetwoplaysintermsof\ncharacterarcs,aslybitofinter-referencing\ngoing on and the use of projections.\nBartlett wrote Earthquakes in 2010,\nfour years before King Charles, which I\nwould argue \u2013 casting a glance over the\nsublime stage directions on the script\n\u2013 makes sense, because Earthquakes is\nmuch more experimental and downright\nwackier, while King Charles tries to\nbe a more sobering affair, given that\nit contains more instances of long\ndialogue and unfolds at a slower pace.\nWatching the UCL students\nperform was an excellent prompt for\nthe question: Are humanities students\nnaturally better at performance/writing/\nthe arts? Clearly, they spend more\ntime immersed in poetry, books, plays,\nclassical works, depending on their\ndegree, so this influence must rub off\non them more and encourage them to\nhave a better creative process, surely.\nWhile the STEM students are\nwrapped up in numbers and dissections,\ncoding and lab work, their artistic senses\naresadlybereftofanyhumanities-related\nstimuli and must curl up and wither\nwith every tap on the calculator, right?\nVoicing aloud my rather negative\nthoughts on this matter, your fellow\nImperial students confessed with\nstartling ease: I have spoken to\npeople who hold dreams of becoming\npoets, writers, actors and composers.\nIt\u2019s a clich\u00e9 by this point, but everyone\nneeds an outlet from work and the\nnear separation of Imperial from\nhumanities subjects could mean STEM\nstudents are able to throw themselves\nall the more eagerly into their hobbies\noutside of their degrees. I must add\nhaving an experience of both science\nsubjects and the arts means you would\nbe a more rounded, knowledgeable\nindividual, able to navigate a scientific\ncommunity as easily as a bookshop.\nOr that\u2019s the hope, anyway. It must all\nboil down to this: passions aren\u2019t really\npassions if you don\u2019t fight for them.\nYes, there are bad days of grappling\nwith STEM and studying so hard\nyour hair falls out, but that doesn\u2019t\nmean you shouldn\u2019t compose, write\npoetry, or miss out on theatre!\nSpeaking of, why don\u2019t you come\nto DramSoc\u2019s play, scheduled at the\ntime of writing for January 26th, 27th\nand 28th at the Bridewell Theatre.\nYou are very warmly invited to come\nsee our production, a labour of\nmuch love: Earthquakes in London!\nFRIDAY 6TH JANUARY 2023\n7\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nScientists on stage\nSophie Reck-Pointon Arts Writer\nArts\nAre humanities students inherently better at the arts?\nA throwback to when Felix covered DramSoc\u2019s performance in Nov 2012\nThe Theatre - the place to be this January\n\n"
