    "content": "2 FELIX Profile\nMr. ULMrMWUl\nThere can be few students at\nthis College who remain unaffected by the work of Mr. McDowall. His responsibility is wide-spread; the welfare of overseas\nstudents, the organisation of Commemoration Day, and the running\nof General Studies and Touchstone.\nMr. McEtowall joined the College's Administrative Staff in 1949\nafter a unique procedure of 36\nhours of examinations and inter-views. Until then, his career had\nencompassed many fields; he was\neducated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, where he took\nModern Greats. He worked for\nUnilever\u2014on the Times editorial\nstaff\u2014taught at Lancing and\nStowe\u2014served on the General\nStaff as Education Officer in Germany. Not long after coming to\nthe College the then Rector\nSir Roderic Hill, who had started\nTouchstone weekends in 1950,\npersuaded the Board of Studies to\nstart General Studies in 1952.\nHe is directly concerned, although behind the scenes, with\ntwo tn port ant problems facing\nthe College. Aproximately one\nthird of I.C. students come from\noverseas, many from countries\ndesperately short of men of their\ntraining. Their welfare is essential\nand Mr. McDowall, as secretary to the Committee on Overseas students, tries to help them to\nget used to the discomforts that a change of climate and custom\nimposes. However he finds that\nsome expect too much attention\nfrom the English students who are\nalready busy and preoccupied.\nRecent years have seen much\ntalk about the two cultures. I.C. has attempted to alleviate the\neffects of increasing intensive\nspecial is ation by Touchstone and\nGeneral Studies.\nTo provide five speakers each\nweek for twenty weeks of the year\nis no small undertaking. Some are\nobtained under the auspices of the\nCollege Societies, however much\nis left to the personal endeavours\nof Mr. McDowall. When asked\nhow he obtained the various and\nnumerous speakers he replied, \" I just write to them, sometimes they\ncome, sometimes they don't.\" Many of those to whom he writes,\nare well known personalities of\nradio and T.V. Often such people\nare too busy, but some welcome\nthe opportunity to visit a College\nso near to the centre of London.\nCollege connections with the\nUniversity and with industry are\nmost helpful.\nIt is inevitable that not all the\nsubjects covered by General\nStudies pack a lecture theatre.\nThey are not expected to do this,\nnor to provide a deep study of the\nsubject, but rather to stimulate a new or encourage an existing in-te rest. The success of a given lecture depends to a large degree on\nthe lecturer. He can transform a potentially uninteresting subject or\nruin a good one\u2014a fact of which\nMr. McDowell is only too well\naware. He is worried by the lack\nof scope for any active participation and so regards Touchstone\ndiscussion weekends as more important than lectures; and as\nanyone who has been to Silwood\nPark wil j agree, a mid-term\nweekend away from London is\nmost refreshing.\nSilwood Park provides a relaxed atmosphere in which one\ncan advance ones own theories on\na subject of topical interest and\nuphold them, or watch them being\nripped to pieces; for surely the\npower of argument must be an\nintegral part of any education.\nThe accommodation and the\nnumber of weekends possible are\nlimited, but Mr. McDowall would\nlike to extend the Touchstone approach to General Studies. Now\nthat the College has more residents he would like to see groups\ngather to discuss a given lecture,\nperhaps with the speaker himself.\nHe regards the formation of discussion groups as one of the important roles that the Halls could\nfulfill. It is this type of activity\nwhich will help break down the\nwater tight compartments which\nStill pervade South Side. He is\nanxious that as full a use as possible be made of the opportunities\nthat the Halls offer. It is. strange\nthat so many people are worried\nby the neglect of internal developments in the Halls and yet so little\nis done, that they remain virtually\nunused.\nMr. McDowalPs work is essential to the College. Many of the\nCA.T.'s possess a complete\ndepartment devoted to General\nStudies. I.C., one of the foremost\nscientific institutions in the co un try, does not. On what is its\nfuture reputation to rest?\nMERVYN TONES AN OPEN INVITATION The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like9 the\nMidland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those\nwho are older and already established. The Midland Bank is interested in YOU\u2014-and all young people like you. You would find a bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of paying bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of\nyour expenditure.\nMidland Bank THE GO-AHEAD BANK FOR GO-AHEAD PEOPLE,\n\n"

C. showed that they had been taking it easy in' previous rounds\nby outplaying an efficient Guys Hospital team at Berrylands in their\nU.C. Cup semi-final. The final against either L.S.E. or Q.M. C. now\nseems only a formality before the cup returns to South Kensington\nfor the sixth successive year.\nm] The first shot of the match\ncame from inside right Colin\nCasemore when he hit the ball\nhard and just over the bar in the\n6th minute. Guys immediately\nretaliated and for several minutes\nplay centered about the I.C. penalty area. Shots went wide,\nhowever, and Jim Ingram in goal\nwas not unduly worried.\nIRON DEFENCES\nPlay swung freely from end to\nend for the rest of the first half\nwith little chance of anything but\na breakaway goal piercing the two\niron defences and with Guys looking the more likely to score it.\nThe closest they came to it,\nhowever, was when a sizzling shot\nfrom their centre forward went\njust the wrong side of the upright\nin the 20th minute, and as the\nlast minutes before the interval\nticked away it was I.C. who\nstarted taking the initiative and\nshowing their class in a series of\nraids on the Guys goal.\nH.T. GUYS 0\u2014I.C.0 At half time the game was still\nvery much in the balance, but\nI.C. showed the shape of things to\ncome when, in the second minute\nafter the re-start, right back Steve\nFisher appeared in the penalty\narea to head a high cross hard,\ninches over the bar.\nGuys were still threatening to\nbreak through whenever they got\nj CROSSCOUNTRY NOTES By Frank Hobson\nOn Wednesday, January 15th we sent our 1st team to Sandhurst\n(always an excellent opportunity\nto see how the other half lives)\nwho, as was expected, defeated us\nby 28 pts. to 52; which score\nmight have been far greater but\nfor the assistance of Graham\nTilly, I. C.C.C.C. captain of several years ago, who came second.\nThat day it was also our turn\nto organise the league II match.\nFinding enough people to. help\nwith a race of nearly 100 runners\nbadly de pleated our third team,\nbut with the excellent heij p of\nTony Bigg\u2014a new discovery\u2014we\ndid better than expected.\nThe following Saturday (18th) we had an away race against\nLeeds and Birmingham Universities but got no more than 80 miles\nalong the Al before we were\nbeaten back by fog.\nA four-way home match with\nRoyal Vets. U.C., and Westminthe ball, but in the 49th minute it\nwas the Hospital goal post which\nshook to an I.C. shot and in the\n54th their goal ke per was forced\nto make a brilliant close save from\nan I.C. corner.\nGOAL No. 1\nA minute later, centre forward\nDenny Vaughan latched on to a through pass from Keith Stoddart\nand put an economizing lob over\nthe head of the advancing goalkeeper and into the net on the\nthird bounce.\nThis relieved the I.C. team of a great burden and they Started to\nplay a more relaxed brand of\nfootball, threatening to over-run\nGuys time after time as the College forwards swept in towards\ngoal. For the first time, the\nUniversity men seemed to be playing up to their own standard\nrather than to that of the hospital.\nIt Wi-i almost 20 minutes before\nGuys managed to work another\nserious shot at goal, but then, in\ntwo dangerous attacks, they were\nthwarted by the ability of Ingram.\nGOAL No. 2\nGuys never really looked like\nscoring again, however, and in\nthe 86th minute, a well taken goal\nby Stoddart from a Casemore\ncross gave I.C. victory by a margin which reflected their performance more fairly.\nster Coll.

    "content": "FELIX dear sir... DISGUSTED\nDear Sir,\nI wish to express my disgust at\nthe corrupt implications underlying the suggestive pose featured\non the back cover of the 200th FELIX. If this is representative\nof the thoughts dominating the\nminds of some students in IC,\nthen they should cease to propagate this sort of moral depravity\nand concern themselves with the\nmore fundamental and vital issues\nof life. I do not expect such\nobscenity to emanate from the\nminds of morally responsible\nbeings.\nYours sincerely,\nD.J. PHILLIPS\n(President ICCU)\nFalmouth Hall.\nSHOCKED\nDear Sir,\nI was deeply shocked and distressed to read the article entitled\n\" UNDERSEXED \" in the last\nissue of Felix. Figures are quoted\nwhich, if they are correct, must be\ndisturbing to any responsible student of this College. The suggestion that the low percentage of\nstudents at I.C. who experience\nsexual intercourse before they\ngraduate is due to sexual apathy\nand thai this should be deplored\nis disgusting.\nThe appearence of this article\nis even more regrettable in view\nof the high calibre of the ref t of\nthe same is ue of Felix. This seems\nto be an example of the shallow\nsensationalism recently de pre ca ted. We want Felix to become\na\" newspaper with a certain\namount of dignity and one of\nwhich the College can be proud,\"\nbut we certainly will not achieve\nthis end by printing articles such\nas \" UNDERSEXED,\" especially\nsince a large number of students\nare now living in College Halls of\nResidence.\nI would like to point out here\nthat sexual intercourse outside\nmarriage, i.e. fornication, is\nwrong and many religions and\nsocieties forbid it. The Christian\nposition is clearly stated; \" You\nmust abstain from fornication\n. . . not giving way to lust like\nthe pagans who are ignorant of\nGod \" . . .\u2022 \" For be very sure\nof this: no one given to fornication or indecency . . . has any\nshare in the kingdom of Christ\nand of God.\" (1 Thess. 4.4; Eph.\n5.5. N.E. B.) The non-Christian\ntoo must surely realise that promiscuity undermines the basis of\nsociety. If we cannot discipline\nourselves in this matter how can\nwe discipline ourselves in matters\nof truth and liberty!\nWhatever the private views of\nthe writer of \" UNDERSEXED \"\nhe was ill advised to publicise\nthem in Felix, and all self respecting students of this College will, 1\nfeel sure, join with me in requesting that this type of article does\nnot appear in future issues of\nFelix.\nJ.E. SHERIDAN\nDear Sir,\nIt must be a very immature\n\"Special Correspondent\" (anonymous, of course]) who equates\ninterest in sex and promiscuity.\nSomeone should tell him (or\nher!) that one doesn't have to\nsleep with a girl to prove that one\nis sexually attracted to her, and\nthat one is a real man ay shown\nin \" Bass \" adverts.\nYours faithfully,\nJ.G. SELLARS\n(Physics II)\nDear Sir,\nIn an age when science has\nalready acquired respectability\nand when engineering is rapidly\nfollowing suit it seems a great\npity that this cradle of both faculties should be so adolescent in its\nattitudes. I choose to say adolescent because the outstanding\nfeatures of one such are a curious, groping mind and a crude\nunpolished wit. On the other hand\nthe adult is distinguished by a balanced critical mind and a sophisticated sense of humour.\nAs scientists or engineers we\nmust judge a society by its pro-ducts. On this basis I condemn\nthe recent Guilds \" festival of\nmusic and culture \" as a festival\nof filth and as a product of under-developed, adolescent and warped\nminds. I also criticise you, Sir, for\nprinting that tasteless unnecessary\narticle entitled \" Undersexed\"\nin your last issue. It would have\ndone more good to the reputation\nof Felix to have left a blank space\n\u2014 or perhaps to have inserted\nyet another Watson profile.\nDISAPPOINTED\nDear Sir,\nI would like to express my disappointment at the front and back\npages of the 200th edition of\nFelix.

    "content": "FELIX Felix\nThis column will appear after\nthe Union Meeting on 18th Feb, rua ry, when the whole problem of\nFelix and the Executive will be\nhistory. The main dispute arises\nout of the pig headed behaviour\nboth of Mr. Watson, the Union\nPresident and Mr. Combes, the\neditor of Felix. The attitude of\nthe President is summed up by\nhis letter in the last edition of this\nnewspaper and his inconclusive\nmotion to the Union Meeting\nC0LCUTT\nwhich leaves him scope only for a personal attack on Mr. Combes,\nwho remains adamant and in dig nant. It seems that neither will\ngive an inch, despite the efforts of\nthe rest of the Felix board, wh c are all agreed that the dispute\ncould easily be settled. I suspect\nthat even Mr. Massey, despite\nwhat the President thinks, is in\nfavour of settling the dispute without a battle. The battle must\nresult, in either the loss of a President, who stands high in the\nscale of competence, when his actions are viewed overall, or the\nloss of an excellent newspaper\nstructure, built up by Mr. Combes\nand his staff, or in nothing, which\nis by no means unlikely. The\nfirst two results would be deplorable and the third would leave the\nsituation unsettled. I will be surprised if anything comes of the\nbattle, despite the two steaming\ncontestants.\nUnion\nIt would seem that people at\nI.C. fall between the two limits,\nwhich I would call \" Sportmen \"\nand \" Socialmen.\" The sport men are defined as those who accomplish a reasonable amount without\nthinking too much and the social-men are defined as those who\nthink too much and accomplish\nlittle. In past years the running of\nthe Union was entrusted to those\ninclined towards the sport men side, and a general outcry was\nraised against the alcoholic excesses of some of them. This year\nthe running of the Union has been\nentrusted to those biased to the\nother side and we have not seen\nany marked improvement in the\nstate of affairs, despite what the\nsocial men predicted. In fact, if\none listens to the comments of\nsome of the college staff and\nadmin people it would seem that\nthey suffer from foot in mouth\ndisease more than their predecessors. The ideal of course would\nbe someone like the late Kitchener, one time President of the\nUnion who combined the characters of both sport men and social-men to just the right degree, but\nideals as everyone knows are seldom attainable. In the light of\nthis some would say that sport-men are prefer r able. Comment\nIt seems to be all the rage these\ndays for Felix staff to use their\nsecond Christian name when writing in the newspaper. No prizes\nVOLUNTARY SERVICE\nOVERSEAS\nVoluntQry Service Overseas (Graduate Division)\noffers to selected volunteers, willing to spend\nat least a year overseas after obtaining\ntheir qualification, the opportunity to\nhelp fill the urgent need for trained men and\nwomen in the developing countries of the\nCommonwealth and elsewhere.\nThis is a chance for you to see something of\nthe world and to make use of your initiative\nand talent where it is most needed.\nThe majority of projects are for teachers\nin secondary-level schools, though there are also\nlikely to be posts in Universities, Training\nColleges. and hospitals; in agriculture,\nadministrative and social services and\nin engineering projects.\nYou will need a degree, diploma, or similar\nprofessional qualification, good health, and\nenthusiasm.

The article\n\"Birdsnest,\" which I am informed\nis based on observations of the\nmoon, seems to be raising indignation amongst our well groomed\nyoung ladies. Many readers of\nthe last issue of Felix marvelled at\nthe picture of Father Ivor apparently defying the laws of gravity.\nI will explain that he is shown\nturning in the narrow road outside\nSouthside on his scooter, which\nhas been omitted from the photo-graph. Congratulations on the\nexcellent supplement from Electrical Engineering, to whoever\nreally inspired it. At present some\nconfusion seems to exist as to\nwho should get the credit. Babb?\nCombes ? Schroter ? At last a Spannerama, which does not insult the intelligence of its readers.\nHAPPY... STRANGE.\nUNIQUE.\nSERVICE OVERSEAS\nRewarding\" Thank you for sending me out\nto one of the happiest, strangest,\nmost unique, at times frustrating,\nbut utterly unforgettable years I think I shall ever spend.\" Thus\nwrote a girl graduate, one ot the\nthirty-six pioneers who went to\nAfrica in 1962. Voluntary Service\nOverseas has been helping boys\nand girls of 18 and over to spend\na year overseas before going up to\nUniversity since 1958, but 1962\nwas the (first year of the new\nScheme for graduates and other\nqualified people to do the same.\n\" Happy . . strange . . unique.\"\nin some ways, she was lucky,\nbeing posted to one of the brand-new African Universities, and\nhelping to build up the framework\nof a young nation's higher e duca tion, virtually from scratch. The\ni great majority of posts under the\nScheme are straightforward teaching jobs in secondary schools,\nwhich demand the same continual\nroutine lesson-preparation and,\nsometimes, slavery to a syllabus,\nas work in an English school.\nFor all that, the volunteers find it\nrewarding work.\nDemand Obviously there is no shortage\nof work. The demand, for some\ntime to come, will always exceed\nthe supply. This is not t^ say\nthat there are not enough candidates coming forward (though\nphysically there must be a limit),\nnor that V. S.O.'s standards of\nselection are impossibly high; the\nthe restricting factor is financial.\nThe host government shoulders\nhalf the total cost of each volunteer's year overseas; they give him\nboard and accommodation and\nthe equivalent of \u00a33 a week pocket\nmoney, or if this is not possible,\na payment-in-lieu out of which\nthe volunteer pays his own rent,\nbuys his food, and employs his\nhouse boy. This is not the bare\nsubsistence level which most\npeople expect as \" volunteers,\"\nbut it is far less than the expatriate\nteacher on contract is paid.\nThe rest of the money needed\nto send a volunteer overseas\u2014the\ncost of travel, clothing and equipment grants, training, admin is tra tion, and the small terminal grant\ngiven to each volunteer\u2014has to\nbe found in this country. Half of\nthe money (some \u00a3650 a head)\ncomes from V. S.O.'s voluntary\ncontributors and the British Government, through the Department\nof Technical Co-operation, has\nagreed to pay the other half,\nmatching the voluntary contributions pound for pound.\nThe great need is for teachers.-V. S.O. only send volunteers to\ncountries which ask for them, and\nof course, they must supply what\nis wanted.\nDifficulties\nIt is easy to emphasise the\nromantic aspects and forget the\nmany and considerable difficulties\u2014the heat and humidity, the\ncontinual necessity of warding off\ndisease, the overall impact of a completely different way of life.\n\" It soon transpired that I would\nbe the only Physics master... as\nmy degree was in P.P.E., this was\nevidently going to be something of\na Herculean task;\" \" The School\nhas no running water, the electricity isn't working \" at the moment \" and is 60 miles from the\nnearest European-type shopping\ncentre.\" And on top of teaching,\nvolunteers take on the organisation of every conceivable kind of\nclub and activity in and out of\nschool, to such an extent that one\nclaims he is working an 18-hour\nday. And yet they still have time\nto write saying: \" I am enjoying\nmyself here very much.\"\nNeither V. S.O. or Britain are\nalone in this field.the U.S. peace\ncorps and the United Nations are\nalso pioneering, as well as any\nothers. All are doing the best they\ncan to meet the urgent need for\ntrained men and women in under\ndeveloped countries; VOL U NTEERS ARE NEEDED NOW.\nQUOTES\n\"Don't knock the Colcutt tower\ndown; how would we know where\nGuilds was.\"\n\n"

    "content": "EDITORIAL FELIX The first Union meeting this term will have been held yesterday,\na Tuesday. This choice of date is strange. On Tuesday most third\nyear Guilds students go to L.S.E. Excluding lunch, they still find\nit difficult to be bac': at I.C. before 1.30 p.m. Most of them will\nwant to eat sometime, and so will probably choose to miss the Union\nMeeting. Further, by holding the meeting on the Tuesday, the\nExecutive have robbed Felix of the chance to discuss, public is^ nd\ncomment on the motions before the House, before they are resolved.\nIn fact, Felix is being deprived of the chance of informing the Union\nabout its own affairs.\nThe only reasons given for this odd choice of date by the Secretary were (a) the Bishop of Woolwich will be talking the previous\nThursday, and (b)a full month is required before the next Union\nmeeting.\nNothing but an act of God (or the pro-Rector), can cause term\nto end before Friday, 20th March; this meeting could easily have\nbeen held on Thursday and still leave a clear month before the next\none. Very odd !\n~ GUILDS UNION MEETING Mr. Schroter read a letter from\nthe National Mental Health Appeal thanking Guilds for the \u00a3135\nthat had been raised during the\nyear. He then gave a summary of\nthe findings of the Working Party,\nso that they could be considered\nprior to the important I.C. G.U.M. Mr. Wise was congratulated for\norganising the successful Engineers Dinner Dance, and Mr. Collins and Mr. Beattie were congratulated in the fields of swimming and amateur radio. Three\npints of beer were produced. One\ncontained a quadruple vodka. Mr.\nBeattie enjoyed the Union Meeting.\nA heap of gro tty rags wearing\na smart top hat, stirred in the\ncorner. It was Yog masquerading\nas a small ghost. An aperture for\nface spoke of the need for material\nfor the Guilds Carnival Cabaret.\nThe material that he had was a bit\nthin. Leg showed. And the Car\nParking Survey was mentioned.\nFestival of Music and Culture\nThree experts in the field were\npresent, Mr. Dowley, Mr.\nThrosby, and Dr. Allen. They\nwere each given a cigarette packet\nupon which to record their.judge-ment s. The first item was Chess\nBoardy. It was the only script\nthat had not been screened by\nthe management; a last minute\nentry. Apologies are offered to\nall that were offended. It is difficult to draw lines without a ruler.\nElec. One produced an art criticism, as given by aM. Bidet, a well known French foot bath. He\nexplained how Constable should\nhave painted the Haywain, but\nleft us in the dark when he drew\nhis conclusions. After some electrical plumbing, sound emanated\nfrom three Electrical guitarists\nfrom three electrical. A murky\ncharacter in a maroon jacket was\nobserved to be grovelling on the\nfloor, holding several pieces of\nwire in close contact, in order that\nsound might continue to emanate.\nA short judicial conference pronounced First Electrical First, and\nSecond Electrical Second. The\nfour carnival tickets, and W.C. Pot were disposed of. M. Bidet\nand friend uttered grateful thanks.\nLikewise Schroter to judges.\n. The new and glorious Spanner\nwas brought forth for in augur a tion. It was suggested that\nSpanner be done in Orange\nSquash by one well know m for such\nconsumption. Milk, Champagne,\nand water were also refused,\nand after a sprinkling ql beer\n(Jones had consumed the rest) the\nmeeting closed with Bob Boomalacking.\n* Star of Yog\n(The sign of good quality)\nDexion, a rapidly expanding\norganisation, is a company of\nyoung men and women, many of\nwhom are already holding\nresponsible management positions.\nWe welcome applications from\nother young people who have\ntalent and wish to use it\neffectively.\nWrite to :\nJ. W. Little (Dept\nCJ OH\nCS)\nDE XION Limited\nEmpire Way,\nWembley Park,\nMiddlesex.\nI was glad to see that the spell\nof fine weather that began a fortnight ago encouraged many\nstudents to venture out for a lunchtime walk to see Albert and\nget a breath of fresh air, rather\nthan sitting in the ICWA lounge\nperusing Readers' Digest and\ntalking \" shop \". A short walk\na day (weather permitting!) is ar\nexceptionally good idea, particularly at this time of the year wher\nthe effects of the winter are begin\nning to make themselves notice\nable on the female form-pudding\ninduced plumpness and in doo i pallor need to be fought now if\nyou are to be looking your best\nfor the Spring. (If you are feeling\nsmug about this, take a long, hard\nlook in a full-length mirror ... . )\nHowever, the means are at hand\n\u2014do not despair Mr. Moonie's soups and salads\u2014no chips! \u2014\nwhen lunching in College. They\nare reasonably cheap and nourish-ing, and will enable you to lose\nthat spurious inch and improve\nyour complexion before the end\nof term.\nNAVY' S IMPORTANT\nSomethng navy will be in d is pensi ble to any girl's wardrobe\nthis summer and the ideal practical answer is ate ry lene, box-pleated skirt. Pans says pleats.\nParis says navy. M&S s peil economy. A permanently pleated\nskirt keeps its looks through wearing and washing\u2014and sitting for\nhours! \u2014and dark blue is a colour\nthat has all the advantages of\nblack without being so sombre for\nthe summer: As navy skirt and a colourful blouse or lightweight\nsweater make a twosome that you\ncan wear to College everyday and\nby ringing the changes on blouse\nor jersey you will have an ever-smart outfit that is high fashion at\nlow price. And navy is so versatile\u2014team it with pink (a combination for which West End\nshops have gone overboard) lime\ngreen, emerald, aquamarine,\nmauve, coral, citrus yellow, burnt\norange or wear it with ever-popular white and the winter's red\naccessories.\nOBITUARY\nThe tragic news of his suicide\ncame as a shock to the friends of\nthe I.C. Iraqi student, S. Hussein,\nthough they had known for some.;\ntime that all had not been well I with him. The eldest son, Hussein\ncame to England two and a half'\nyears ago to study for his A levels ]\nat Gloucester Technical College.\nHe did not go home during this\ntime and had no close relations in\nEngland. His friends found him\nquiet and pleasant to talk to, and\nin his spare time he did some\npainting and reading.\nTwo and a half weeks before\nthe end of the Xmas term, Hussein stopped attending lectures,\ntutorials and Laboratory sessions,\nand he did not take the end of\nterm exam. At about this time\nhe seems lo have moved from\nhis single room in Queen's Gate,\nbut he gave his friends a false new\naddress. He was still absent\nduring the first week of this term,\nand the College wrote to him\nasking why he had not taken the\nexam and also why he had not\nregistered for the University\nexams. The letter was returned\nto the College, as apparently he\nwas not at the Queen's Gate\naddress. During this first week his\nfriends at College told the Iraqi\nEmbassy about his absence, and\none even went to the Home Office\nto try and find out his address.\nHe was told that the address was\nconfidential. The Embassy then\nwrote a letter, but this too was re-turned. During all this time he\nwas only seen a couple of times in\nI.C., watching T.V. in the Union,\nand he could not be found at his\nusual address. Two weeks went\nby and no action was taken by\neither the College or the Embassy,\nthen on January 27th Hussein\ntried to gas himself in the Queen's Gate room. -The Landlord discovered the attempt and 'phoned\nthe Embassy. That evening an\nEmbassy official came round to\nsee Hussein, but he denied the\nattempt and claimed that it was\nan accident. The following day,\nwhen the landlord was out, Hus- <\nsein gassed himself. His friends at\nI.C. heard about it on the 30th and sent a telegram to his parents\nthe next dav.\nLAM LEY'S TECHNICAL& GENERAL BOOKS\nART MATERIALS DRAWING\nINSTRUMENTS\nSTATIONERY\nPAPERBACKS\n1, 3 & 5 EXHIBITION ROAD,\nLONDON, S.W.7 "

And they\nhave been considering Richard Shepherd's design since May, 1963.\nThis might seem reasonable since the U.G.C. is contributing \u00a370,000\ntowards the \u00a3205,000 cost for demolition and erection. But informed\nsources say that the College had hoped to get the plans through in\n2-3 months. They also add that the U.G.C. is using this as a test\ncase for the financing of student sports facilities, and that I.C. studen fs are being used as guinea pigs.\nFurther money is coming from the Centenary Appeal fund\nand from the Imperial College Union (\u00a35,000).\nFurther delays were caused last July when a donation of \u00a3250,000\nwas given to the College to build a new Hall of Residence, and discussions developed concerning its siting. Mr. Shepherd has designed\nthe new Sports Centre, which will be only two storeys high, so that\nin future a new Hall of Residence will be built above it. It was\neventually decided to site this new Hall at the South end of East Side.\nThe new facilities are to include squash courts, swimming pool,\nrifle range, and indoor cricket net. All of which are urgently needed.\nSo come on U.G.C. let's have the okay, otherwise scientists will\nbe emigrating to the U.S.A. because the Sports facilities are not good\nenough.\nI.C.

So much so,\nin fact, that he's asked two^ members of the American debating\nteam to speak. They are: Bob\nHiggins, English grad. of King's College, Wilkes-barre, Pennsylvania, and John Swaney, a North\nTexas State University graduate of\nFrench. Both are experienced\ndebaters, and Swaney has frequently demonstrated his art on\nTexas T.V. The two of them\nare over here with the English\nSpeaking Union.\nHall hopes that I.C. debaters\nwill make a special effort to improve the standard of speeches\nfrom the floor-especially as some\nof lae E.S. U. officials will be\ncoming to listen.\nSo come on l.C, lets have your\nviews on those \"Damn Yankees.\"\nI.C. STUDENT SHOT\nIt is my regret able duty to inform the College that one of our\nmen has been shot. This tragic\nincident occurred when the stu-dent, Mr. Bossard, was out hunting pheasants with a friend. Mr.\nBossard was behind a gorse bush\nat the time, when his \" friend,\"\nseeing a movement behind the\nbush, probably mistook him for\na Peasant, and shot him\u2014in the\narm. He now walks round the\ncollege looking like Napoleon,\nwith five shotgun pellet holes in\nhis arm protesting violently that\nhe is not a peasant.\nQuo*em the Union Office\n\" I want to see Watkins.\"\n\" D 'you mean Jenkins?\"\n\" No!

    "content": "FELIX3 Its not new\nFROM THE FELIX PAST CQLCUTT'S FOLLY Arising from Bill McAuley's strange allusions in \" Phoenix \"\nto the Colcutt Tower, there has\nsprung a new wave of controversy\nthroughout the College. However, this is not the first time that\nthe subject has been discussed.\nSix years ago, comment raged\nfuriously in Felix's columns for\nmany weeks as a result of the\nfollowing headline appearing on\nthe front page of nn issue early in\nthe year. \" A QUARTER OF A MILLION POUNDS FOR COLCUTT'S FOLLY.\" One correspondent claimed that this was a concession to VICTORIAN SENTIMENTALISM while another\nargued that a pit 280 ft. deep be\nprovided so that the Tower could\nbe sunk into it, with hydraulic\nlifting gear available so that it\ncould be displayed on ceremonial\noccasions. Another letter contained the suggestion that\n\u00a3250,000 was far too small an\namount to spend on the tower.\n\"Why not,\" he said \"concentrate\nthe resources of Imperial College\non to producing a LEANING TOWER OF SOUTH KE NSINGTON. After all who would\nhave heard of the leaning tower\nof Pisa if it had been straight.\"\nOne Union meeting was spent\ndiscussing whether a miniature\nColcutt should be constructed to\nserve as a Union mascot for rag\ndays, but this was (unfortunately?) defeated.\nMORPHY DAYS\nThese rag days seemed to have\nchanged very little with time. On\none memorable occasion the\nPolice had to admit that the\narrested men (Guildsmen) had\nbeen picked out at random, and\nthe Magistrate had no alternative\nbut to discharge them, which he\ndid.\nTHE STATE OF THE UNION\nThe issues of Felix for the last\nten or so years ago all carry\naccounts of the depressed state of\nthe Union, and the efforts of each\nsuccessive President to remedy\nthis. Council meetings appear to\nBROWN B AGGER BROUGH have been very much the same\u2014\n\" highly ridiculous.\" The Sollowing momentous decision was\nreached at a Council meeting in\nMay 1957. It was finally decided\nto allow I. C.W. A. to purchase a fish tank to put in their lounge.\"\nThe stirrers, however, were active\neven then. They pointed out that\nthe mortality of fish was very\nhigh.\nTTie cry of many students that\nthe Union itself should be responsible for electing its President is\na weak one m comparison even\nwith the whisper that Felix has\ncarried in its time that the. Rector\nhimself should be elected by the\nstudents.\nUnion card checks are not new.\nThese were carried out seven\nyears ago, and met with a reasonably quiet response. This augers\nwell for Council's latest which\nmay go through without much\nprotest.\nPHOENIX has been through\nrough times with a crisis in 1959\nwhen the Editor was dismissed\ndue to his unwillingness to cooperate with the Board of Directors. The Debating Society, on\nthe other hand, has seen better\ntimes. Even as recently as 1959\nan I.C. team won the U.L. U. Debating Compttition. Attendances at debates were high, and\ngood outside speakers were being\nattracted to the College. This\nsurely shows that there is a place\nfor Debating at I.C. The College powers are almost\nsyn on omo us witT i the College\nitself and they have of course,\nbeen subjected to many a stormy\nattack from (Felix's columnists.\nThe domestic Bursar has been\nparticularly prone but we would\nlike, now, however to record one\nof his triumphs i.e. the occasion\non which he put down poison in\nthe Union, which lead to a mouse\nactually being caught in the bar.\nFor this, and his other glories,\nhe was re-awarded in the Felix\nhonours of 1961, the Charles\nAtlas award for posture. One\nwonders how he and others reacted on the occasion when a baby\nwas found some years back, in the\nSHROVE TUESDAY IN BE IT QUAD GRAVE TTE PANCAKES Beit Quadrangle late one evening.\nProfiles have appeared regularly,\nand many have been duplicated,\nfor example the Union treasurer,\nK.E. Weale, seems to be a particular favourite. Mrs. Robb's criterion for his efficiency is the\nfact that she had to wail five years\nto cadge a sherry out of him.\nLIGHTER SIDE\nOn the lighter side, concern was\nonce expressed at the amount of\ns noggin g carried out in Union\nlounge and this followed by the\nsuggestion that the Felix room\nwould be more suitable.\nFelix has carried many letters\ncriticising it for being shabby,\nsensationalist ic and a whole host\nof other things, but be this as it\nmay, when the occasion has demanded it, Felix's reporting has\nbeen very mature, for example,\nthe Obituary appearing in Felix\nfor Air Chief Marshall Sir\nRoderic Hill, in October 1954\nwas very well written.\nFelix may well have a stormy\nperiod ahead of it, but we feel\nconfident that whatever happens,\nFelix will emerge triumphant\ncomplete with his usual resplendent grin.\nG.S. DATES TO REMEMBER GUILDS The Next Union Meeting\n\"This house believes that Members of City and Guilds Union\nshould concentrate their activities\nmore within that Union, than\nwithin the Imperial College\nUnion.\" This will be the main\nmotion on the floor of the meet-ing, which will be held in Room\n542 Mech. Eng, on Thursday,\n27th Feb. starting at 1.15 p.m. It'll Be Hell... Nympferno, or \" To hell with\nyou,\" the Guilds-mines Carnival\nwill occur on the evening of Friday, 28th Feb. Tickets are on\nsale at the Union price 25s.6d. with 6d. reduction for students.\nThere will be four or five bands\naround . . . Saracens, Shadies,\nPaul London, Bonzo Band, and\npossibly some lads from the\n\"Pool.\" We hope to set the\nUnion into an inferno. Fancy\ndress helps most.\nFILM SOCIETY Luis Bunuel's controversial film\n\" VIRIDIANA,\" which won the\nPalme D 'Or at Cannes in 1961\nand was subsequently banned in\nFrance and Spain (where it was\nmade), will be shown on February\n28th. STARTLING\nAfter the startling and successful carol concert of last term, the\nchoir is to perform the Bach B Minor Mass a little nearer home,\nin the R.C.M. Concert Hall, on\nMarch 13th. The Carol Concert was at the\nHammersmith Town Hall and\ncreated a certain amount of comment since a half hour work by\nHonegger concluded the first half\nof the concert and was repeated in\nfull as the second half.\nThe choir is shaping up to the\nBach very adequately at the mo-ment, and with an orchestra raised\nfrom professional places the performance should be well worth-while. We are assured that the\nwork is to be played only once in\nthe evening.\nE.T. Hu\u00ab*y. go*M ho't it H( WV \u00a3\nLU> US TO\n\n"

Something big is going on;\nvague rumours are running round\nI.C. that the Wooden Horse Club\nis behind it all. What is this club\nthat crops up almost every week\nin Felix ; that some people deem\nto be a secret society ? Essentially\nit is a club to promote the pinching of mascots from other colleges\nand to raise money for the I.C. Carnival by organising stunts and\ncommando squads. The club\nstarted off as an underground\nmovement as the Union disapproved of mascots, and refused to\nhave anything to do with it.\nHowever, with the appearance of\nthe newly painted Phoenix and\nthe official election of the Mascot\nbearers, the club came out into\nthe open and declared its intentions.

    "content": "FELIX dear Sir.,. Dear Sir,\nIt was with some ap~ /tension\nthat I read the epistles concerning\nthe new \"Super-de-luxe\" Carnival magazine that we are pro-mise d. Are we to gather from\nthese gutter al ramifications that\nbawdy humour must disappear\nfrom its pages'? If so, I object l If one grants that true love,\nand therefore sex, is the highest\nemotion that the human race can\naspire U. then it is not surprising\nthat it occupies so much of the\ntime of philosophers, sociologists,\nand anyone else who cares to use\nthe neglected processes of think-ing. Ample evidence is supplied\nby the numbers of authors who\nhave written at great length on\nthis subject:\u2014Aldous Huxley\u2014\n[blindly seeking \" the solution \"),\nIan Fleming\u2014(morbidly ob ses sed), and D.H. Lawrence\u2014(the\nauthority) are a few examples.\nAs one would expect, not all\ntreatises on sex have been serious.\nHenry Fielding, Honore de Balzac, Chaucer and Shakespeare\nhave given us excellent examples\nof hilariously funny sex stories.\nWhilst not soliciting, nor condoning smut, bawdy humour is in\nmy opinion, a necessary component of a civilised society's liter a ture, which, if absent, would\nimply a perverted attitude to sex\nin that society. In the case of\nImperial College, I consider that\nthe Carnival magazine is a suitable\nplace for this form of humour.\nI remain, Sir,\nA \"clean upstanding youth,\"\nBRIAN KING\nMORPHY DAY Dear Sir,\nWe take exception to some remarks in Spannerama of the 2Q() th\nissue. Among the usual Guilds'\nbreast-beating is the statement\nthat RCS and Mines were unprepared for Morphy Day and left all\nthe organisation to Guilds. Until\nthis year Mines had played no\npart in the Morphy Day rag and\nwere not consulted. The vice-Presidents of RCS and Guilds met\nseveral times to discuss plans and\narranged a complete programme.\nGuilds offered to provide the\ntyres and a loud-haile r; RCS pro\nvi ded ropes and custard pies.\nWe can remember the apprehensive expression on the face of\nthe President of C&G when he\narrived in Bo to find 150 RCSmen, 50 Miners, and NO Guildsmen^. Guilds arrived late due to\npolice interference. At Schroter's suggestion RCS and Guilds combined to put Mines to rout. The\nstart of the races was delayed and\nconfusion arose during this time.\nGuilds were happy throwing flour\nover a policeman on a noddy-bike\nand RCS were defending Jez.\nfrom attack by UC and I or GEM\nstudents. With the arrival of the\nMorphy boats some order was re-stored. The trip back was more\norderly than in previous years.\nMorphy Day cannot continue\nin its present form. Some time\nago RCS wrote to the other\ncolleges to support a round table\nconference on this and other\n\" sport \" matters. We are still\nawaiting a reply.\nYours faithfully,\nJ.C. TYE,\nP.A. CUNNINGHAM\nDear Sir,\nWe are fed up with the constant\ncriticisms levelled at our attire in\nCollege publications. We do not\nwear patterned sweaters with tartan skirts, and rarely come into\ncollege without make-up. The\nmajority of us have, and wear\n}\nshoes with the new chunky heels,\nwhich we bought before the. injunction to do so. that appeared\nin the last edition of Felix. Who\nnoticed?\nWe are certainly not the on l\\< girls who feel this w< iy. There are\nmany others who dress like ri.v, and better, and if fault is f<> be\nfound with us, w lw t about the\nstandard of dressing attained, or\nsunk to, by many men'? Scruffy\nsweaters, ill-fitting jackets, dirty\nshoes and lack of shaving are all\ntoo common.\nWe don't mind a certain\namount of merited criticism, but\nfeel it Mhould not be limited to the\nwomen of I.C. Yours faithfully.\nThe Girls of Physics II\nSOUTHSIDE THIS IS SERIOUS\nLet's face up to reality. Fact\none is that in a few year's time\nthere will be ten or eleven Halls\nof Residence in I.C.. and a large\nproportion of the students will be\nliving in College. Fact two is\nthat these students will spend a large pare of their time in Hall,\nand small groups of people with\nsimilar interests will be formed\ninside the Halls. Fact three is\nthat the Halls will play such an\nimportant part in the College luc\nthat the I.C. Union will have to\nplay a new role in association\nwith them, or it will die from lack\nof support. The members of I.C. should recognise these facts now,\nand start working towards a better I.C. of the future. The\nUnion will have to accept that in\nthe Halls small groups and societies will form which will not\nfit into the larger structure of\nI.C. itself. There will be considerable sport played between\nthe Halls. Past members of Halls\nwho are still at I.C. will obviously\nfeel some attachment to the particular Hall he or she came from,\nand will probably continue to\ntake part in many of the Hall's activities. Eventually, fresher s will be able to choose, if they\nwish, to be actively attached to a particular Hall, with the probable\nview to spending at least one\nyear in that Hall. Sporting activities between Halls will probably\nbe only concerned with the major\nsports, and I.C. will run only two\ntop teams in these sports. It will\nthen be more of an honour to\nplay for I.C.A final fact is that\nthe Constituent Colleges will\nrapidly lose their relevance and\nimportance. Lets' face up to\nreality.\nPETER A RIDING.\nBARMAIDS\nRumours about aS. S. barmaid,\nwhich confused even Felix are\ndue to the fact tint several app li cants, some fsm a Je, have been\nconsidered as extra bar staff.
