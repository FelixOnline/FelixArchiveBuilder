    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n10\nGerman-born Professor Benjamin\nList of the Max Planck Institute and Scotland-born Professional\nDavid MacMillan of Princeton University have been awarded the Nobel\nPrize in Chemistry for their work on\norganic catalysts. They independently\ndeveloped the technique of asymmetric\norganocatalysis in 2000. Before then,\ncatalysts were thought to only be metals\nor enzymes.\nMacMillan had been working on\nmetal catalysts at the University of\nCalifornia. Metal catalysts are typically\nexpensive, unsustainably acquired, and\nrequire an oxygen- and moisture-free\nenvironment, which limits industrial applications. List, working at the\nScripps Research Institute, had been\ninterested in research from the 1970s\nwhich suggested certain amino acids\ncould be used as catalysts. Both found\nthat small organic compounds can act\nas very effective catalysts. Being composed of fairly common elements, these\ncatalysts were cheaper, more sustainable,\nand easier to manufacture.\nWhat made the discoveries particularly revolutionary was the catalysts\u2019\nability to produce only one form of\nmolecule out of the two mirror image\nforms that many molecules can adopt.\nThis had wide-ranging and important\nimplications. Mirror image structures\nof the same molecule can have very\ndifferent properties - for example,\nspearmint and caraway both contain the\ncompound, carvone, but taste different\nbecause they contain mirror-image versions of carvone. Compounds used in\npharmaceuticals tend to only be effective in one of these mirror-image forms.\nThis can mean one version is harmless\nand the other is effective. However,\nin more severe cases, the undesirable\nmirror-image can have negative impacts\non the body.\nThis was brought to light in the\n1950s, when thalidomide was approved\nfor treating morning sickness. It was\nfound that the mirror-image of the molecule caused severe physical disabilities\nin the new-born babies.\nBefore asymmetric orga-nocatalysis, there was no\nefficient way of producing\nonly one mirror-image\nform of a molecule.\nThe Nobel Committee\nsaid that the technique\nhas \u201ctaken molecular\nconstruction to an entirely new level.\u201d Professor\nMacMillan upon hearing\nthe news said he felt \u201cdazed, confused,\nelated, proud, sentimental, weepy - you\nname it\u201d, and Professor List was on\nholiday in Amsterdam with his wife,\nwho he claimed frequently liked to joke\nthat Sweden was calling him, when he\ngot the call, and had initially \u201cthought\nit was a joke\u201d. The \u00a3870,000 prize will\nbe shared between the two.\nCara Burke Science Editor\nEdited by: Isabelle Zhang\nJamie John\nCara Burke\nMarek Cottingham\nScience Against rationality\nExamining the work of Paul\nFeyerebend\nBy Leo Zhang\n12\npage\nThe 2021 Nobel Prizes\nChemistry: Organic catalysts\nBenjamin List (left) and David MacMillan (right)\nPhoto credits: Niklas Elmehed \u00a9 Nobel Prize Outreach\nPhysiologyorMedicine:Receptorsforheatandtouch\nHow are we able to sense where\nour body parts are without looking at\nthem? How can we sense temperature\nchanges in the world around us? Of\nthe five senses, the molecular detection of vision, olfaction, audio, and\ntaste are well understood. It is relatively less known how our bodies can\nperceive touch and the stimuli associated with it. For breakthroughs in the\nmolecular sensors that our bodies use\nto detect heat, pain, and touch, the\nNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this year was jointly awarded to\nDavid Julius and Ardem Patapoutian.\nDavid Julius made his discovery\nin the 1990s when he found an ion\nchannel that reacts to capsaicin, the\nchemical responsible for the feeling of\nheat from chili peppers. His lab had\nscreened through a library of thousands\nproteins until finding one that, when\nexpressed in a cell, allowed it to give off\nelectrical signals in response to capsai-cin. This ion channel, which they called\nTRPV1, allows the rapid entry of Ca2+\nas a response to temperatures above\n43oC, acidity, and chemicals similar to\ncapsaicin. Since then, Julius and other\nresearchers have discovered more members in the TRP protein family that are\nheat-sensitive, including TRPV2 which\nreacts to temperatures above 52oC, and\nTRPM8 which is sensitive to temperatures below 20oC. The mechanism\nbehind the heat sensitivity of these\nproteins are still being understood, with\nresearchers observing that the increase\nin temperature leads to a change in solubility and charge of the amino acids,\nthus forcing the ion channel to open or\nclose.\nMore recently, Ardem Patapoutian\ndiscovered a population of cells that\ncould respond electrically when mechanical pressure was applied on them\nby poking them with a micropipette\ntip. By inactivating the potential genes\nresponsible in these cells one by one,\nhis lab eventually found cells that no\nlonger responded when poked, thus\ndiscovering the mechanosensitve ion\nchannel Piezo1. In its unactivated state,\nPiezo1 naturally curves the cell membrane around it to form a sphere that\nprojects into the cell. When mechanical pressure is applied that deforms\nthe membrane curvature, it is thought\nthat the \u201carms\u201d of Piezo1 can act as\na lever to transfer the mechanical\nforce from the membrane to the\nchannel to open/close it. A similar\nion channel, called Piezo2, was later\ndiscovered. This protein allows us\nour body to detect the position of its\nown parts based on mechanical stretch\nsensed by the membranes of neurons.\nTogether, this work allows us to\nunderstand how our nervous system\ninterprets varying levels of heat/touch\nand relays the corresponding electrical\nsignal to our brain. These form the basis\nfor how we navigate the world around\nus and regulate the systems inside us.\nIsabelle Zhang Science Editor\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons\nDavid Julius (left) and Ardem Patapouten (right)\nPhoto credits: Victoria Xu (Imperial, Life Sciences)\n\n"

Just\nbefore the pandemic,\non 7th March 2020,\nReckitt hit a trough\nstock value of 5374.\nBy 11th July 2020,\nReckitt stock price\nhad peaked at 7754,\nor a 44% increase in\njust 4 months. Reckitt\nalso reported \u00a31.696\nbillion in operating profit for just the\nfirst half of 2020, up \u00a3221 million\nfrom the same period the previous\nyear. It\u2019s no secret that a global\nboom in disinfectant products was\nmostly responsible for this rise.\nMore recently, HSBC has set\naside \u00a3650 million for bonuses for\nits bankers this year, following a\nquintupling of profits in the first half\nof 2021,whencomparedwiththesame\nperiod last year. These profits have\noccurred due to a number of irregular\neconomic circumstances leading to a\nbooming economic recovery and high\nrates of mortgage lending. One large\nfactor in this recovery, as recently\nacknowledged by HSBC\u2019s CEO, is\nthe world leading, yet eye-wateringly\nexpensive, vaccination programme.\nHaving shelled out for one of the\nmost socialist economic responses to\nthe pandemic world-wide in the form\nof the furlough scheme, it is clear that\ntheUKgovernmentseesthepandemic\nas a burden that should largely\nnot have to be shouldered by the\nindividual.Whythenarethesesectors\nthat have drawn in record profits,\nalmost entirely by fluke\nthat their commodities\nare desired in a locked-down world, able to reap\nthe rewards scott-free and\nincur no extra taxation?\nDo we really think that\nkey management changes\nwithin Dettol have led\nto astronomical profits\nthat break all records,\nor could it be that every public\nsurface and exposed digit has been\nsanitised to within an inch of its life?\nAs we can see from the recent\nNational Insurance hike, running an\neconomy that shelters so many people\nat no extra cost is not sustainable.\nBut part of the cost has been passed\nto the tax payer, partially in an effort\nto tackle the NHS backlog which, of\ncourse, was caused by locking down.\nMeanwhile the \u00a3221 million extra\nprofit taken by Reckitt has been\nstashedaway,andHSBCshareholders\nhave received an average of just under\n\u00a31 million each over the last year in\nprofit shares. I am personally very\nfar from a socialist, however I can see\nno justification for not introducing\na windfall tax on companies unduly\nprofiting from the pandemic,\ninstead of removing the universal\ncredit uplift and hiking National\nInsurance. This operating procedure\ncan only lead to the rich getting\nricher and the poor getting poorer.\nPandemic Profit Windfall\nThe Felix Editor on\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\nEDITORIAL\nFelix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nStatement\nof Intent\nAt Felix we believe that it is always\nin the interest of the students to\nknow.

The dishes are piled up so high in\nthe sink that you can\u2019t even run the tap without water spraying everywhere. I found a rotten\npiece of meat in the top shelf of the fridge, and\nits juices have leaked out and contaminated the\nfood on the lower shelves. And to top it all off,\nI found mouse droppings in the corner of the\nkitchen! I\u2019m sick of living in this filth, and I don\u2019t\nwant to risk actually getting sick. What can I do?\nA\nThat sounds absolutely awful! No one deserves to live in those conditions, and your\nconcerns about health and hygiene are valid. I\nwould recommend having a chat with someone\nin the Advice Centre about your concerns; you\ncan reach them at advice@imperial.ac.uk. They\nhave helped numerous students with a wide\nvariety of housing complaints, and have truly seen it all; in fact, it happens to be the most\ncommon type of concern that students have approached them with over the past three years!\nThey can go over anything from your rights\nas a tenant to assertive communication techniques that you can use to approach your flat-mates about your concerns in a productive way.\nQ\nI\u2019m a fresher and an international student\nfrom the United States. I\u2019m feeling a bit out of\nplace at the moment when it comes to finding\na group of people to spend time with; I don\u2019t\ndrink alcohol and I don\u2019t really like to stay out\nvery late. What is the best way to make friends\nthat would not involve going out or drinking?\nA\nThis is an excellent question! Let me be the\nfirst to reassure you that you are not alone; I\npersonally know of three people who are in\nuniversity and have never had a sip of alcohol\nin their life! Please don\u2019t feel embarrassed or\nout of place because of this personal choice;\nit\u2019s a really positive thing to be aware of your\nown boundaries. As for making friends, my\nsuggestion would be to have a look at the 364\nclubs and societies that are currently being run\nby students, for students. A great way to do\nthis would have been to attend the Welcome\nFair on October 5th, where you would be able\nto talk to current members in these societies\nand sign up to their mailing lists. Keep in mind\nthat you may need to shop around and attend a\nfew meetings with different groups before you\nfind a place that you truly feel like you can fit\ninto; some clubs put more of an emphasis on\ndrinking socials than others. Speaking from\nexperience though, the effort put into this\nis well worth it; finding that source of peer\nsupport can support your mental wellbeing,\nwhich could have a positive impact on your\nstudies as well!\nQ\nMy anxiety has gotten a lot worse during\nthe pandemic. I haven\u2019t been able to bring it\nup with my family since they have a lot of very\nantiquated ideas about mental health, and I\ncan\u2019t expect much support to be found at home.\nIt\u2019s getting to the point where I\u2019m struggling\nacademically and I don\u2019t think I can manage it\non my own anymore. What should I do?\nA\nThank you so much for being so open and vul-nerable. I know that this isn\u2019t easy for you to talk\nabout, especially given the stigma that you have\nto face from home. I would encourage you to\nhavealookatthecounsellingservice;itisself-re-ferred, and you can reach them at counselling@\nimperial.ac.uk. The service is completely confi-dential, and you will not need to disclose your\nengagement with it to anyone else, at College\nor at home. They provide up to 6-8 sessions for\nfree, after which you can be referred to the Mental Health Advisory Service for more long-term\nsupport. The Disability Advisory Service is also\nself-referred and can provide support services\nsuch as study mentoring and can help you set\nup special arrangements for your exams. Finally,\nI would also encourage you to get an appointment with a GP at the Imperial College Health\nCentre and ask how they could help support\nyour work in counselling. Once a GP has made\ncontact with you, they will be also be able to support you with writing letters for mitigating circumstances and/or special exam arrangements.\nI know that this can be a lot to take in, but\nthe important thing to remember is that you\nare not alone, and that there are people here\nat Imperial who can and want to support\nyou. You made it to Imperial because you are\nbright and talented; your current struggles\nand obstacles do not make that any less true.\nThis Week\u2019s Gossip...\nMESSY FLATMATES\nT-TOTAL? ANXIETY\nIf you want to ask Eugenie anything, email DPWelfare@imperial.ac.uk\nIt\u2019s totally confidential!\nWe here at Felix CAN\u2019T BELIEVE that the \u201cperson with the fun hair\u201d tried\nto charge RSM \u00a3100 for a member throwing up in the toilet of the Union barwe\u2019re excited to see how much the fine for throwing up over the bar staff is\n\n"

Complex systems consist of many\nsmaller parts, which interact with each\nother in seemingly random ways. They\nare chaotic, meaning that a small change\nin initial conditions can have a huge\nimpact on the final state. The climate\nis just one example of such a system.\nClimate change has dominated world\naffairs in the past few years, and the\nNobel Committee have clearly recognised that, and affirmed its significance,\nin their awarding of the Prize.\nSyukoro Manabe is a meteorologist,\nwho, during the 1960s and 70s, developed three-dimensional computer models of the atmosphere and the ocean,\ncoupling the two together for the first\ntime with his colleagues at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in the\nUSA. He and the teams he has worked\nwith have used these models to investigate the impact of changing greenhouse\ngas concentrations on climate. They\ndemonstrated how increasing CO2 emissions\nhave increased surface tempera-tures, quantifying the effects.\nHis work has\nbeen hugely\nimportant in\nunderstanding the effect\nof human behaviour on climate change, both\npast, present, and fu-ture.\nKlaus Hasselmann is an oceanographer who, around ten years after\nManabe\u2019s initial work, used computer models to explain why weather can\nvary so unpredictably, while climate\nmodels maintain reliability. Outside of\nthis, his research was used to prove that\nhuman-related CO2 emissions are the\nprimary cause of the increased temperatures observed around the world.\nGiorgio Parisi is a theoretical physi-cist, who was awarded the prize for his\nwork on complex systems and \u201cthe discovery of the interplay of disorder and\nfluctuations in physical systems from\natomictoplanetaryscales.\u201dHisworkhas\nimplications for a vast range of fields;\nneuroscience, biology, machine learn-ing, finance and (perhaps most notably,\ngiven the other two Physics Prize recipi-ents) climate modelling all benefit from\nhis research.\n`\nThis week in Science...\nFive million children orphaned due to COVID\nLife expectancy declining in many English communities even\nbefore COVID-19 pandemic\nFirst Malaria vaccine approved by the WHO\nAn international team of collaborators, including researchers from Imperial\u2019s Department of Mathematics and School of Public Health, have\nfound that the number of children orphaned has increased as a result of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The latest estimates\nsuggest that at least 5m children have lost one of\ntheir parents or grandparents over the course of\nthe pandemic. India is the worst-affected country,\nwith just under 1.9m children estimated to have\nbeen orphaned, as of 3rd October 2021. An interactive comparison can be found at the QR code.\nA new study published in The Lancet by researchers from Imperial College London has found that many communities in England experienced\na decrease in life expectancy from 2010 to 2019, after the vast majority\nsaw growth from 2002 to 2010. Stark geographical disparities were also\nidentified, with the lowest life expectancies in urban areas in the North\nof England. Professor Majid Ezzati from the School of Public Health at\nImperial College London said, \u201cFor such declines to be seen in \u2018normal\ntimes\u2019beforethepandemicisalarmingandsignalsongoingpolicyfailures\nto tackle poverty and provide adequate social support and healthcare.\u201d\nLast week, the World Health Organisation (WHO) endorsed the RTS,S\nvaccine against Malaria and recommended its use for children in Sub-Saharan Africa where the disease is most prevalent. Development of the\nvaccine has been a 30-year effort costing about US$750 million, with\nfunding mainly from GlaxoSmithKline and the Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation. The vaccine targets the parasite before it enters the bloodstream and has been observed to decrease hospitalisations caused by severe malaria by 30%. Currently no other vaccine against Malaria is as advanced in its development and approval.\nFROM IMPERIAL...\nFROM AROUND THE WORLD...\nDeepMind develops AI capable of accurately predicting rain\nIn collaboration with the Met Office, researchers from DeepMind published a paper in Nature outlining the results of an AI that can accurately\npredict how likely it is to rain within the next two hours. The AI uses\na machine learning method known as generative modelling, based on\nhigh-resolution radar data that tracks the moisture level in the air. The\ntool is observed to be more accurate than existing rain prediction tools\nand weather forecasts, which perform well for predicting the mid-term\nfuture (1-2 weeks) but are not as accurate for predicting the near future.\nPhysicists measure precisely the lifetime of a free neutron\nScientistsledbyagroupatIndianaUniversityhavemadethemostprecise\nmeasurement of a free neutron\u2019s lifetime so far, improving on previous\nmeasurements by twofold. Neutrons are stable inside nuclei, but outside\natomic nuclei, free neutrons will decay into protons and emit electrons\nand neutrinos in the process.

    "content": "9\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nI\nn an ideal world actors would be \u2014 well just ac-tors. Shape shifters and illusionists that embody\na character, and not entities to be divvied up into\nany arbitrary category and classified. And plays\nwould be \u2014 well just plays. A vehicle to provide for\nan audience an abundance of drama and/or catharsis.\nAnd so, in such an ideal world, no character is out of\nreach for a versatile actor, and no play too rigid and uninviting to re-interpretation. But, alas, we do not live\nin such a world, we live in an imperfect world where a\nfemale Bond is still a matter of question, and ill-con-ceived notions of tradition dictate how certain works\nmust be interpreted and treated.\nIn such a climate, it is highly refreshing to see the\nYoung Vic\u2019s Hamlet (directed by Greg Hersov) where\neach of these pre-conceived notions is not just ignored,\nbut summarily cast aside. With a brilliant gender-blind\ncasting (Cush Jumbo playing Hamlet), a non-elaborate\nbut powerful set design, and through the unashamed\nincorporation of modern apparatus into the play \u2014\nHersov has brought Hamlet into the 21st century, with\ngrace!\nHamlet is Shakespeare\u2019s tragic telling of the eponymous Prince of Denmark, a corner stone in playwriting\nit is a work oft treated with (well-deserved) reverence.\nAs such, the story needs no elaborate retelling here; after all no one watches Hamlet for the suspense.\nThere are several elements that this production gets\nright: chief among them is the acting. The star-stud-ded cast deliver a stellar performance, and none shine\nbrighter than Jumbo as Hamlet and Polonius (played\nby Joseph Marcel). Marcel is able to induce equal\namounts of slyness and comic intervention into his\nportrayal and remains the life and soul of the first Act.\nJumbo, a close contender who really takes over in Act\n2, is equally magnificent and presents a uniquely tempered Hamlet. She shows great dexterity rendering the\nconvoluted verbiage of Shakespeare while remaining\nboth accessible and relatable. Norah Lopez Holden\n(playing Ophelia) enchants in her few scenes with a\ntruly youthful exuberance. Her dreamy dance with\nHamlet in Act 1, swaying along to a peppy salsa beat,\nreally sets the stage for the remainder of the play.\nEqual credit is to be accorded to the set design and\nlighting, which is arguably the backbone of the play.\nMinimalist, sublime and translucent, it offers neither\na convoluted royal courtroom setting, nor graveyards\npunctuated with sombre statuettes (as is commonplace\nin Hamlet). Instead, we are given three large rectangular pillars \u2014 some mirrored and some matte. These pillars revolve around their axis and serve to act as gates\nand entrances; reflecting the characters and the light\nin intelligent ways. This comes together phenomenally\nwell in key acts, rendering brilliant lock-cages for the\nghostly apparitions and the characters themselves \u2014\nbringing an additional sense of character to the unfolding drama.\nThe play is not all smooth sailing though. The performance of the remaining cast does pale in comparison to\nthat of Jumbo and Marcel, and this shows in the scenes\nwhere they share a stage. Due to the modern interpreta-tion, it does take a while to get used to watching Shakespearean verbiage juxtaposed with modern props. The\n\u2018Tis\u2019 and \u2018Thou\u2019 hover over the Cockney accent like\na thick cloud, and the modern suits, phones, selfies,\nKevlar\u2019s and guns do appear jarring. But a few uneasy\nminutes in \u2014 these convalesce and what remains is no\nlonger Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet but rather an imperfect\nyet brilliant Young Vic and Hersov\u2019s Hamlet!\nWhilst I don\u2019t want to dwell too long on the novelty of the elements here\u2013for as much as it\u2019s worth\nappreciating the wind of change they represent\u2013the\nwork is also so highly meritorious that it begs criticism\nand treatment independent of it. And again, this is\nnot strictly a story of firsts; plays have often been the\nmedium of choice to drive change and, even with this\ngender fluid portrayal of Hamlet, we have had female\nactors play the eponymous prince since the 18th\ncentury\n\u2014 beginning with Charlotte Charke. Cush Jumbo as\nHamlet here, with all the bells and whistles of the 21st\ncentury, is just one manifestation upon that enduring\nlegacy \u2014 to break moulds and pre-conceptions, and to\ndo it successfully.\nHersov, in the director\u2019s production catalogue, muses about wanting to eventually make an eight-hour\nlong version of Hamlet, before going on to underplay\nthe current version as what is physically possible in the\n\u201chere and now\u201d. Step up man! This version is nothing\nshort of a home run! And if it is any barometer of his\nvision and interpretation, I\u2019d gladly pay to watch the\neight-hour version. But, until then \u2013 in the here and\nnow \u2013 I\u2019d recommend everyone to watch 2021\u2019s Hamlet at the Young Vic. \u2018Tis a consummation devoutly to\nbe wished!\n\u2018Tis a Consummation Devoutly to be Wished\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nHamlet\nWhere?

    "content": "This play is billed as \u201cThe Dumb Waiter meets\nBlack Mirror\u201d and, well\u2026 that\u2019s exactly what you\nget. The stylisation, lighting, sound, tone, and plot are\nall heavily influenced by Charlie Brooker\u2019s sci-fi television series (check out Hated in the Nation from the\nthird series of Black Mirror for example). But this isn\u2019t\nexactlyabadthing.Thelightscomeuponasemi-naked\nwhite dude, Tony (Henry Davis), who has \u2013 until now\n\u2013 been sleeping deeply in a bed centre stage. Tony is\nclearly in a hotel room, with the remnants of a sexual\nliaison the night before littered around the bed; and,\nas he wakes up and takes a phone call, we also learn that\nhe is posh, married, and, to use his later words, a\nbit of a c*nt. Enter Sarah (Niamh Finlay) and Marcus\n(Robert Boulton) to help remedy that fact with a live\ntrial by social media.\nThere is something very satisfying about the perfect\nexecution of a simple idea. This play explores justice\nand revenge through the torture and forced interviewing of an alleged sex criminal. Everything in this play\nseems to be blunt, on-the-nose, and unapologetic. The\nlikes and thumbs-up from the livestream are projected onto an actual black mirror. But, and this is the key\npoint, everything seemed to work as it should. The audience is trapped in the room in the same way Tony is.\nThe door is shut and, as the tag line of the play reads,\n\u201cthe door stays locked until the job is done\u201d. The dialogue between the characters is uncompromising in its\ndepiction of morality and ideology in the post-internet\nage, and Tony\u2019s monologue about truth rings\u2026 true?\nIf you are familiar with any of the works mentioned\nabove, then you already know how this play is going to\nWhat constitutes rape? Do people of all ages and\ngenders understand explicit verbal consent?\nArethepeoplearoundusandthesystemssetinplaceto\nredress victims and prosecute offenders well equipped?\nAnd more importantly \u2014 what\u2019s the detritus of such\nan offence on the people around us? These are some of\nthe questions that Penetration running at The Cockpit\nseeks to rake up.\nInspired by seven real life incidents, Lloyd-Davies\nweaves an intricate story revolving around these\nthemes through the lives of seven characters weaves an\nintricate story revolving around these themes. The story takes off with Anna McIntyre (played by Georgina\nArmfield) accusing Sean Jackson (played by Calum\nWragg-Smith) of rape; and we follow along as their\nlives unravel from the consequences of that accusation\n\u2014 watching as they turn to the people around them for\nsupport and a voice. The story pulls no punches and\nlays out, with excruciating detail, the follies of the support systems we turn to \u2014 be it our parents or spouses,\nsocial media, or a support group.\nAs for the execution itself, the play is set \u2018in the\nround\u2019 at The Cockpit. The characters weave in and\nout of the pews and, using four simple chairs and\nsome elementary lighting, they serve us a multitude of\nmake-believe settings from police stations to clubs. For\nthe most part however, the play is held together and\ndriven by fast-paced dialogue between just two charac-ters, and the scenes transition in such rapid succession\nthat it feels as though you are watching jump cuts in a\nDavid Fincher film.\nThe cast all offer convincing portraits of their characters but Louise Bangay, playing Sean\u2019s mother, is a\nstandout as a shell-shocked mother who can\u2019t help but\n\u2018seek to understand\u2019.\nThe play chooses to steer clear of offering any social\ncommentary or explicitly taking sides \u2014 though by\nchoosing to engage only within the confines of those\nreal-life incidents it does give a strong voice to characters clearly biased on the issue. Perhaps that\u2019s the intended effect to highlight the injustice of biased cogs\nin a system? This for one makes the play hard-hitting,\nintimate and brutal; but, at key moments, the lack of a\nunique voice sticks out and the production begins to\nresemble a collection of regurgitated tabloid stories.\nWithin these confines, Penetration raises some\nhard-hitting questions \u2014 both of our individual ac-tions, and of what we tolerate around us. It was interesting to find during the interval (and more vocally in\nthe Q&A session with the cast later), people of all ages\n(including octogenarians) talk in hushed tones questioning the simple concept of right and wrong in this\ncircumstance with their better halves. The fact that this\nplay instigates such conversations should be the key\nyardstick of its success here.\nSo, go for a complicated, messy, and honest portrayal of rape and consent. Only know \u2014 if you walk out of\nthis without feeling unease, you probably haven\u2019t been\nfocusing enough.\nBold and uneasy!\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nPenetration\nWhere?

He is my favourite type of\ngrime, I think because of the witty lyrics.\nDo you have any memories you associate with that\nsong?\nMy dad showed it to me. He now references the lyrics\nat everything.\nWhat is your favourite lyric in that song?\nRight off the bat, my favourite lyrics are \u201cIf one of you\ntry and violate me / You get a punch in the face with my\nfront door key / Punch in the neck with my back door\nkey / Box in the mouth with my X6 key / Box in the eye\nwith the fob / I use to log into my HSBC.\u201d How else\nwould you start a song?\nYou\u2019re stranded on a desert island and can only listen\nto albums for the rest of your life \u2013 go:\nBuck Fever \u2013 Estradasphere. That album is endless\nentertainment.Itgoesfromheavymetaltobigbandjazz\nto 8-bit videogame music to screamo. There\u2019s so much\nvariation, so much different shit. They\u2019re just a group of\nCanadian college students, and they sound exactly the\nsame live. In song songs there are some really intense\nand complex sequences, and they just run through it\neasily. There\u2019s also a fiddle player. My favourite songs\non the album are \u2018the dapper bandits\u2019, which is a story\nwith a chase scene, a bit in a club, and also \u2018the bounty\nhunter\u2019, which is just a solid piece.\nNonagon Infinity \u2013 King Gizzard and the Lizard\nWizard. When I first heard this album it sold the entire\nband to me, and then they went on to release a million\nmore albums. It is great to be a Gizz fan as they\u2019re always\nchurning out really cool good music. I used to listen to\nthis album on the bus to school because it infinitely\ncycles, so I would just listen to it on repeat for the hour\nI had to travel.\nBrown Sugar \u2013 D\u2019Angelo. I always put this album on. I\nwas listening to it to get through lockdown, because it\nhas a trance effect on you, it really chills you out. The\nvocals are crazy. It sounds like he\u2019s saying words, but\nnothing he says makes sense or has meaning, it\u2019s just\nnoises. There\u2019s not much to say about it, you literally\njust have to listen to it.\nYou\u2019re at a party and someone passes you the aux.\nWhat are you putting on?\nThe innate dickhead in me would put on something to\ntroll everyone, like maybe a track from this electronic\nalbum that just samples washing machine sounds. But\nto be honest I\u2019d probably put on a Jay Z and Kanye\ncollab, like \u2018Clique\u2019, or \u2018edamame\u2019 by bbno$. It slaps.\nWho is your guilty pleasure artist?\nJustin Timberlake. Has to be. I had Justified on CD in\nmy car and me and my friends would sing along to it. I\nwent to an all boy\u2019s school, so we had four untalented\nsingers hitting all the high notes in \u2018Senorita\u2019 and \u2018Cry\nMe a River\u2019.\nWho is your musician crush?\nD\u2019Angelo. He\u2019s too sexy. He\u2019s always high or horny, the\ndude is too sexual. He actually stopped making music\nfor a while because he was being sexualised too much at\ngigs and didn\u2019t want to be.\nOnto your music - you filled in for bass with\nQuadronauts at last Friday\u2019s Welcome Ball before\nBig Narstie, but what is your favourite song to play\non bass?\nThis has made me realise how much I play. I\u2019m usually\nasked to fill in, so it\u2019s not normally music I usually like\nthat I play, but I still get into it if it\u2019s got a good bassline.\nThere was a song by Snarky Puppy that I played with\nImperial\u2019s Big Band. I can\u2019t remember the name but\nI love that one. When I played the fresher\u2019s ball,\nQuadronauts sent me a set of 8 songs to learn, and said\nwe would be performing 3, and I didn\u2019t listen to any of\nthem and learnt them by ear at rehearsals. Turns out I\nhad never heard \u2018Under Pressure\u2019 by Queen before. I\npicked up bass to learn songs by Royal Blood, which I\nstill enjoy playing.\nWhat bands influenced Rakin and The Rakins?\nI like to think of Rakin and The Rakins as like the start\nof music, where it all began. People will look back at\nthem like the second coming of Christ or the invention\nof the wheel. We don\u2019t have any influences, but we\nexclusively play Stevie Wonder.\nFinally, any last words?\nListen to the band formerly known as Rakin and The\nRakins, and big up Archie Taylor for being in every bit\nof music I\u2019ve ever done.\nRakin Gilani doing what he does best - shredding on bass - at\nlast Friday\u2019s Welcome Ball.\nPhoto credits to Lloyd James\nIf you want to talk about your favourite songs in Felix,\nemail us at music.felix@imperial.ac.uk!\n\n"

However, in a\njudgement published last Wednesday,\nthe Tribunal found him guilty of 33 out\nof 36 counts of giving inappropriate\ntreatment to terminally ill cancer\npatients of which he admitted 30. The\nTribunal will now decide whether the\nresult impacts his fitness to practice\nand whether he should face further\nsanctions. This may extend to him being\nstruck off the medical register.\nIssues first arose surrounding\nStebbing, who has a first-class degree\nin medicine at Oxford University,\nand who has worked in the United\nStates, the Royal Marsden and Imperial\nCollege in 2017 when he was accused of\nfailing to discuss the risks and benefits\nof treatment with patients and failing\nto maintain proper records. Soon\nafterwards, a whistle-blower passed a\ndossier to General Medical Council and\nthe Care Quality Commission which\nraised further concerns about Stebbing\u2019s\nbehaviour in his private practice.\nAllegations in the dossier allegedly\nincluded claims that the oncologist\nproscribed expensive cancer\nmedication beyond the remit\nof his licence and continuing\ncare even when the benefit\nof such was unclear.

Stebbing\nhimself also tried to argue that the\nGMC\u2019s position of \u201cIf you\u2019re in doubt,\nlet the patient die\u201d was itself neglectful\nwhile he had prioritised the saving of\nlives.\nAn Imperial College spokesperson\ntold media that while Stebbing\ncontinued to do a \u201csmall amount\nof clinical work\u201d, he was kept under\nsupervision.\nContinued from page 1\nCredit: Imperial College London\nMedical malpractice\nFRIDAY 15TH OCTOBER 2021\n5\nNews.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.com\nNEWS\nproscribed expensive cancer\nmedication beyond the remit\nof his licence and continuing\ncare even when the benefit\nof such was unclear.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nSCIENCE\nScience.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n12\nAgainst rationality\nIn coming to Imperial, the only UK\nuniversity to focus specifically on\nscience, engineering, medicine and\nbusiness, our relationship to science\nis probably quite secure. But throughout our formal education in science,\none area which remains curiously un-der-emphasised is the constraints and\nvalidity of scientific knowledge.\nWashed up on the shores of received\nknowledge, the conception of science\nmost of us have loosely can be described\nas scientific materialism \u2013 a position\ntraceable to the philosophers and scientists of the early 20th century Vienna\nCircle. It takes only statements, verifiable by empirical observation or logical\nproof, to be capable of containing factual information about our reality - myth,\nmystery and religion melt into air, under\nthe white heat of the scientific method.\nThe endpoint of which aims to unite the\nthreads of the universe into a grand tapestry of a universal theory of everything,\nunder the auspices of scientifically verifiable fact, as heralded by Hawking and\nKrauss in all good bookshops.\nThe sixties ushered in more radical\ncurrents of thought into the philosophy\nof science, catching the contemporary\nmovements of revolution and insurgency in the air, notably Kuhn\u2019s \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions\u201d, which\nattacked the abstractions of science as a\nprocess of continuous evolution towards\ntruth. Paul Feyerabend (1924-1994), a\nphilosopher of science not known for\nmincing his words, launched his critique\nin this vein.\nBorn in Vienna, he had an unconventional path to philosophy- originally\nstudying theatre and stage-management\nafter serving in WW2, switching to\nphysics from history and sociology at\nuniversity, and finally transferring into\nphilosophy to leave with his doctorate.\nHis subsequent trajectory, after settling\ndown to a career in philosophy, wasn\u2019t\nany less idiosyncratic. His thought\ncharted a path from the po-faced logical positivists, through Popperian ideals\nandintoachampioningofan\u201canarchist\u201d\ntheoryofscience.Hismostfamouswork\nAgainst Method (1975) is a biting expression of this mature radicalism.\nIn direct repudiation of his earlier work, in it he sought to debase the\ndogmatic view that the scientific method was the key engine driving scientific\nprogress- calling into question Science\u2019s\nauthority over knowledge (now often\ntaken as a sovereign fact). If scientific knowledge wasn\u2019t legislated for by\nmethodology but instead was a melange\nof contingent factors, purposeful omissions and rhetoric, what separates Science from dreaded metaphysics?\nThrough the book, Feyerabend revels\nin uncovering this whitewashed history.\nHe exacerbates, highlights and brings\ninto unresolvable tension fundamental\ndisparities between theory and historical practice. Our image of scientific activity is fixed along certain methodological lines: viable theories should match\nempirical evidence and new theories\nshould be consistent with established\ntheory.\nFeyerabend raises the simple objection that no theory every fully corresponds to all the \u201cfacts\u201d in its domain.\nOur point of acceptance creates the entrance of intersubjectivity. Nor are the\n\u201cfacts\u201d ever neutral objects. They are\ninextricably tangled up in history and\nas a product of the diverse events and\nscientists that produced them, they are\nirreducibly heterogeneous with ancient\nassumptions embedded alongside orthodox science. It is a mistake to think\nthat they refer to some objective state of\naffairs.\nThus it is unfair to judge new theories\nby the status quo. They lack the apparatus of the established. It is only after we\nbuild up relevant auxiliary sciences and\nnew idioms do we have grounds for a\nfair comparison - as Feyerabend put it:\n\u201ctheories become clear and \u2018reasonable\u2019\nonly after incoherent parts have been\nused for a long time\u201d. It is in this way, he\npoints out, that each theory creates experience anew. To accommodate it we\nhave to irrecoverably alter the sensory\nand conceptual core of experience to allow for \u201cnew facts\u201d to legitimise our theory (\u201capproximations are made, known\naffects are omitted, different conceptual\nlines are drawn\u201d). To form and defend\nthem requires a belief akin to religious\nfaith: Newton himself had to resort to\n\u201cdivine intervention\u201d to account for the\nSolar System\u2019s stability under his theory\nof gravitation (and to spread them requires a sort of \u201cpropaganda\u201d).\nWithout this recourse to external,\ninconsistent measures, theories and ridiculous ideas, we are unable to break\naway from the presuppositions of established theory latent in all empirical evidence gathered under such institutions.\nThrough historical examples employed\nthroughout, Feyerabend shows us, in\napplying our standards retroactively, we\nwould deny our sciences of the theories\nof Galileo, Newton, Bohr etc. Feyerabend\u2019s infamous answer to our initial\nquestion is then a blithe: nothing, \u201canything goes\u201d.\nAll of this probably rattles against\nyour own beliefs. It\u2019s hard to recognise\nwhat remains, in Feyerabend\u2019s dissection\nof science, of what drew us to study science in the first place. His proclivity to\nprovoke does nothing to settle our ship\neither. But from under the fire that Feyerabend lights at our feet, he pushes us\ntowards the limits of what we call \u201crationality\u201d: a logic which has legislated\nand justified the worst excesses of Western \u201ccivilising\u201d influence. To subject\nScience to insuperable rules derived by\n\u201creason\u201d would be to nullify Science,\nthis is the problem Feyerabend sought\nto address! He believed the same to be\ntrue with economics, culture and all\nof humanity\u2019s endeavours. Under the\ngrowing encroachment of neoliberalism\nand technologism, inscribing more and\nmore of our horizons and possibilities\nwith their \u201crationality\u201d, and the spectre\nof ecological collapse in the closing dis-tance, it remains a pertinent concern for\nour age.\nLeo Zhang Science Writer\nScience writer Leo Zhang explores the 1975 science philosophy book, \u201cAgainst Method\u201d, by Paul Feyerabend\nJohn Feyerabend\nPhoto credits: Wikimedia Commons\n\n"

Moving from their garage-rock roots to heavy but danceable\nsongs, the 5-piece are a band you\nwant to catch before they make it\nbig.\nView online here!\nEnding a two year\nlong hiatus, Mitski\nreturns with a subtle\nbut devastating ballad\nabout the stark reality\nof chasing your dreams, alongside a series of tour\ndates . If you are lucky enough to find a resale\nticket, catch her at The Roundhouse on 28th\nApril.\nWorking the Knife by Mitski\nSingleoftheWeek\nSix 2021 Albums by Artists Coming\nto London This Year\nWritten by Giovanni Fran\u00e7a Music Writer\nOpinion\nblack midi \u2013 Cavalcade | Avant-Prog |\nTwo years after releasing\ntheir debut, Black Midi\u2019s\nsophomore effort is an\nexceptionally eccentric\namalgamation of sounds\nand influences, that\nsomehow does not sacrifice\ncohesiveness. Even if the\nsongs do not hold an obvious common thread, the\nsequencing of the album makes it cinematic, notably\ndue to the ominous instrumentals and Geordie\nGreep\u2019s vocal interpretation. His lyricism is also an\nessential puzzle piece of the artwork, adding a layer of\nchaosanddisorientation.Thecombinationofallthese\nelements creates an ongoing tension throughout the\nentire tracklist, which is grandiosely released in the\ncloser. It is hard to compare Cavalcade to any other\nband, but this time I will recommend it to listeners of\nSwans and King Crimson.\nCatch them at Alexandra Palace Theatre on Nov 11th\nShame \u2013 Drunk Tank Pink | Art Punk |\nShame is a band emerging\nfrom the Windmill scene\nin Brixton, alongside the\nlikes of Black Midi, Squid\nand Black Country, New\nRoad. Drunk Tank Pink\nis their second full-length\neffort, released at the very\nbeginning of 2021. The group offers a much more\naccessible sound than their peers, insisting on strong,\nrepetitive, danceable melodies. However, the album\ndoes explore introspective themes, where the vocalist\nCharlie Steen often paints sceneries with a palpable\nanxious atmosphere. His energetic delivery is one of\nthe highlights of Drunk Tank Pink, giving it a slight\ntheatrical quality. Overall, it is a solid and catchy\nalbum that achieves shame\u2019s ambitions but leaves\nsome room for improvement. It might appeal to those\nwho are into IDLES or even Gang of Four.\nCatch them at Electric Brixton on Nov 12th-13th\nLittle Simz \u2013 Sometimes I Might Be Introvert | Hip\nHop |\nIf Simz\u2019s last album, GREY Area, was her\nburgeoning, Sometimes I Might Be Introvert is her\nblossoming in the mainstream. The Londoner themes\nof her fourth album celebrate the black community\nin the city, fluctuating between the North and the\n\u201csouth side of that River\nThames\u201d. On top of that, the\nvivid, epic atmosphere of the\nproject develops on Little\nSimz\u2019s continuous push for\nwomen empowerment. The\nrapper also focuses on some\nvery personal struggles,\nhence the name of the album. She explores themes\nof introversion, family, and her path as an artist,\naccompanied by organic, intricate beats. If you are a\nfan of Noname, or the jazzier side of Kendrick Lamar,\nSometimes I Might Be Introvert is for you.\nCatch her at O2 Academy Brixton on Dec 16th-17th\nCHVRCHES \u2013 Screen Violence | Synthpop |\nThe Glaswegian trio is back\nwithanotherproject,anditisa\nsuccess among their long-time\nfans. Going for an unforeseen\nrock-hinted sound, they\nreleased ten well structured,\nradio-friendly tracks. Rather\ncatchy, Screen Violence holds\nvery strong singles in an already consistent tracklist.\nUnexpectedly, The Cure\u2019s Robert Smith shows up\nfor a feature placed as the centrepiece of the album,\ncomplementing Lauren Mayberry\u2019s gleaming vocals.\nNaturally, her talent is evident throughout all songs.\nEven if the production is not quite on the same level\nand the instrumentals may get repetitive, her voice is\nthe persistent motor that gets Screen Violence running.\nGive it a try if you enjoy Paramore or London\nGrammar.\nCatch them at O2 Academy Brixton on Mar 16th\nJapanese Breakfast \u2013 Jubilee | Synthpop |\nThe band embodied by\nKorean-American musician\nMichelle Zauner returns with\na new album and a poppier\nsound, putting her elegant\nvocalsinthespotlight.Ranging\nfrom pop anthems to idyllic\nballads, the project preserves\nitssummeryvibesfromstarttofinish,providingavery\neasy listening experience. It has interesting grooves,\ncaptivating basslines, and a surprising number of\nclassical instruments, uncommon for this genre. The\nproduction is top-notch, realised by Zauner herself\nand well-known names such as Alex G.

    "content": "Direct Air Capture has been the\ntalk of the town in recent weeks\nas the world\u2019s largest DAC facility,\nlocated in Iceland\u2019s Hellisheidi, opened\nfor business last month. It may be a\nsolution to our current climate crisis\u2019s\nmost pressing concern \u2013 reducing the\namount of excess carbon dioxide being\nemitted into the atmosphere.\nNamed Orca, the newly opened\nDAC facility was built by Swiss\nstartup Climeworks. The plant\ncost $10 - $15 million (\u00a37.3 \u2013 \u00a311\nmillion) to build and took four years\nto complete. It is a collaborative effort\nwith Icelandic company Carbfix,\nwhich has developed the technology\nfor diverting the captured CO2\nback into the ground, where it will\ntake about two years to mineralise\nand be stored away forever. All of\nthis is powered by the neighbouring\nHellisheidi geothermal power plant, the\nthird largest in the world.\nDirect Air Capture works by filtering\nin ambient air using large fans. It is\na much more energy-costing process\nthan capturing factory or power plants\nemissions straight from the source \u2013 this\nis because these emissions are already\nenriched with CO2. In contrast, ambient\nair contains only 0.04% carbon dioxide.\nThe filtered air is treated with a chemical\nmedium that forms a carbon-rich salt,\nwhich is subsequently converted into\ncalcium carbonate. This is heated to\n100 degrees to produce CO2 that can be\ncollected, and this is where Carbfix\u2019s role\nof injecting the captured carbon dioxide\nback into the ground comes in.\nTo prevent global temperatures from\nrising above 1.5 degrees in the coming\ndecades and avoid irreversible climate\ndestruction, the IPCC has stated that\nthere must be a \u201clarge-scale deployment\nof carbon dioxide removal measures\u201d.\nDirect Air Capture could allow global\nemissions to remain at higher levels for a\nlongtimeintothefuture,buyingussome\ntimetodismantlethefossilfuelindustry.\nOf course, there are other methods of\nremoving CO2 from the atmosphere \u2013\nplanting trees and growing forest space\nbeing the most obvious ones. But these\nmethods are time and space consuming,\nand in the case of the climate emergency,\ntime is of the essence.\nHowever, Direct Air Capture\ntechnology is still in its early days.\nDespite being the world\u2019s largest DAC\nfacility, Orca\u2019s CO2 capturing abilities\nare limited to 4000 tons a year. This is\na minuscule fraction of the CO2 emitted\nby fossil fuels and industries today,\nwhich was 34 billion tons in 2020. 4000\ntons amounts only to the carbon dioxide\nemissions of 250 American households.\nThis technology is also extremely costly\n\u2013 Climeworks offers individuals and\ncompanies the opportunity to purchase\ncarbon offsets at a steep price of $1,200\n(\u00a3881) per CO2 ton.\nThis may seem like a dishearteningly\nsmall outcome for an extortionate cost,\nbut it certainly is a tentative step in the\nright direction for the future of this\ntype of technology. Climeworks claims\nthat by 2035, the cost could be reduced\nto as low as $100 (\u00a373) per ton. So\nalthough there is still a long path ahead\nregarding cost reductions and efficiency\nimprovements, Direct Air Capture\noffers us a very promising solution to\nour pressing need for negative emissions\ntechnologies.\nKEEP THE CAT FREE\n14 Environment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nENVIRONMENT\nBOOKRECOMMENDATION\nTo what extent does individual action contribute to\nmitigating climate change?\nRecent years have seen many\npeople becoming more aware\nof daily choicces they can take\nto reduce their negative impact on the planet - whether it\u2019s\ntaking public transport, cutting down on meat consumption or carrying a reusable bag.\nIn many ways, the COVID19\npandemic made it easier for people to implement these behav-iours; we might\u2019ve had more time\non hand and staying at home\nautomatically reduced transportation fuelled GHG emissions.\nBut as we transition back\ninto the pre-pandemic life,\nwhich of these pro-environmen-tal actions will stay? And how\ndo we measure their impacts?\n\u2018Living the 1.5 Degree Lifestyle\u2019\nby Lloyd Atler is an attempt to answer these questions. Grounded\nby scientific research, yet accessible to all, it highlights why some\nindividual actions may be more\nproductive than others, and concludes that whilst on their own, it\nwon\u2019t solve the climate crisis, they\nare a crucial component of the\noverarching solution; one that\nmust also include rapid, just, and\neffective policies and education.\nLiving the 1.5\ndegree lifestyle\nDirect air capture - The real solution?\nMarie Mori Environment Writer\nMonami Miyamoto Environment Editor\nAre carbon-capture plants a viable solution?\nPhoto: Martin Grincevschi on Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "What is the role of PhD supervisors when it comes to supervising PhDs?\nOne answer I came across lately is\nto help PhDs write good disserta-tions. But is that all there is?\nDoes the good only apply to the the-sis?\nI suggest the answer to be to assist students towards becoming self-reliant and\nimpactful thinkers.\nDuring my job search as a final-year\nPhD candidate, I came close to the requirements of entering an academic\ncareer. The application and interview\nprocesses made me wonder what exactly a PhD candidate needs in order to be\na well-prepared job market candidate.\nWhat came to me very often is not only\nabout a good PhD thesis, but more importantly other key capabilities, such as\nindependent thinking, selling, network-ing, self-confidence, resilience, and the\ntacit knowledge of the rule of academic\ngames.\nI would be too idealistic to assume\nthat all these skills are the responsibilities of PhD supervisors. But the blurry\nboundary of responsibilities between\nparents, PhD supervisors, universities,\nand PhDs themselves does not stop one\nasking what is the least a PhD supervisor\ncan do for a PhD candidate. Especially\nas the majority of the time PhDs spend\nis with supervisors during the PhD pro-gram.\nIf we agree on the assumptions that\nmostPhDsapplyforPhDprogramswith\nthe goal of entering academia and PhD\nsupervisors are there to help support\nstudents\u2019 vision, then not only is a good\nPhD thesis not enough but it also serves\nas a misleading goal. Very often, job market candidates do not have a finished\nthesis by the time they start job appli-cations. Focusing on a good PhD thesis\nmay be convenient for PhD supervisors\nas professors are normally very busy with\ntheir own agendas, but it is not helpful\nfor a PhD student to be fully prepared\nfor an academic career that asks for independent and impactful thinkers.\nI believe that PhD supervisors have\nmore opportunities, knowledge, power,\nand benefits to shape PhD students to\nbecome well-prepared job market candidates than other stakeholders. Don\u2019t get\nme wrong \u2013 I am not saying that PhD\nsupervisors need to impart everything\nonto PhD students; where students can\njust sit and absorb. Instead, I am saying the PhD supervisors\u2019 role needs to\nexpand to more than just helping PhD\nstudents finish good theses. A good thesis may be a necessary condition but it\u2019s\nnot a sufficient condition for a good researcher if academia is the goal.\nI suggest that the role of PhD supervisors is multi-dimensioned and is about\nassistance towards self-reliant and im-pactful thinkers. Here, I want to emphasize three dimensions:\nHelp PhDs become independent\nthinkers. PhD students at the start can\nbe very overwhelmed by classic papers\nand big names in the field. This mindset\nmay prevent students from challenging\nwell-established theories, especially the\nones from supervisors. I am not suggesting PhD students should challenge\neverything supervisors and existing\ntheories say in order to be independent thinkers who succeed in academia.\nI argue that PhD supervisors should\nprevent forcing students to accept what\nthey believe is right or discouraging students\u2019thoughtswithoutaconversational\ndiscussion to help students understand.\nInstead, PhDs need to be encouraged\nand nurtured to think logically them-selves, with words of reason, without\nraising ones\u2019 voice and without pushing\nself-designed rules.\nFacilitate and encourage PhDs to\nfind their own identities. The identities\nI mentioned here can be academic or\nnon-academic. If academic, then identity can include epistemological, onto-logical, methodological, and theoretical\nones.Iamnotsayingthattheseidentities\nhave to be well-established at the PhD\ngraduation date. It takes time to find\nthese identities and identities are also\nfluid depending on circumstances. But\nthe journey rather than the result is the\nmost important part. Fear of students\nmaking mistakes should not be a reason\nto control students\u2019 path, nor should the\ndrive of self-protection. Students will\ngain confidence as well as trust that they\ncan decide everything on their own with\nthe respect from supervisors. At the end\noftheday,itistheresponsibilityofPhDs\nto make their own choices. Being driven\nby self-interest is also more likely to lead\nto impactful research in the long run.\nShow empathy but no praise and\nno rebuke. Presumably, every PhD supervisor was once a PhD student. This\nmeans that PhD supervisors know the\nhardship of getting a PhD degree. On\ntop of having a high and strict standard\nfor PhD students, it is also vitally important to show empathy, e.g., saying \u201cI feel\nyou. I have been in your shoes. It is very\nhard\u201d, to form a trustful partnership. At\nthe same time, when it comes to training self-reliant researchers, either praise-based or rebuke-based supervision is\nhelpful. While praised-based supervision may cause dependence on external\nadmiration and a competition-orient-ed rather than a cooperation-oriented\nmindset, rebuke-based supervision is\nlikely to give rise to contempt and drive\nfar away from a respectful and trustful\nrelationship.\nSelf-reliant and impact thinkers may\nnot have the best dissertations at the\nend of PhD programs (as do lots of big\nnames), but they may use the PhD journey to experiment and then figure out\ntheir identities, train their independent\nthinking skills, cultivate mentoring and\nteaching capabilities, develop selling and\nconferenceorganizingskills,andprepare\nother channels to contribute to societies\nin their own ways. Knowledge (or we\nsay theories) keeps updating \u2013 the best\ndissertation at one time may be outdated very soon, but the capabilities gained\ncan not only never be outdated but also\nenable impactful research and mentor\ngood thinkers in the long run. Focusing\non producing a good thesis thus constraints the endless possibilities for improving oneself during the PhD journey.\nLotsofPhDstudentsdonotknowthe\nresponsibilities of PhD supervisors, preventing them from asking for help when\nthey need it, especially when supervisors\nare very busy and when academic culture\nshows hierarchical favour. Similarly, I assume professors may not know or do not\nhave time to notice struggles many PhD\nstudents face when very often students\nare too afraid to speak up, or professors\nare too busy to be found.\nI believe discussing this question\nopenly is a good opportunity to help\nboth parties understand each other before the partnership and achieve synergy\nduring the partnership. It is also important for the environment and community to look at how to better design incentives and rules to foster such trustful and\nlong-term-oriented partnerships.\nDo PhD supervisors only guide\nPhDs to write good dissertations?\nSelinaCao\nResearchPostgraduate\nFRIDAY 15TH OCTOBER 2021\n30\nComment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nEdited by: Khama Gunde\nComment\n\n"

The format\nof the Henley Regattas\nis a gladiatorial style\nknockout system.\nTwo crews race side\nby side over the course\nand only the victors\nwill race again the next day. Racing in\nthis format leaves no margin for error,\nwhilst the compounding fatigue of day\nupon day of racing can leave the athletes\nfeeling off their best at the start line.\nHenley Women\u2019s Regatta, which is\nusually held a few weeks before Henley\nRoyal, on the same course, is an amazing\nrace which can attract crews from\naround the world. While the timing and\ncourse were slightly different this year, it\nwas no less important to those who took\npart. From Imperial, the team consisted\nof a quad and a coxless four. Most of the\ngirls travelled to Henley the night before\nracing began, on Thursday 1st July,\nstaying in a house near the course, which\nthey were delighted to learn had a pool.\nIt would have to wait until later though\nas they had an early start the next day.\nThe first round was a qualifying race,\na time trial over the course from which\nthe top crews go through to race at\nthe weekend. As a result of their time\ntrial performance, the\ncoxless four received a\n\u2018by\u2019 through the first\ntwo rounds, meaning\nthey did not have\nanother race until\nSunday. Unfortunately,\nthe quad were up\nagainst some tough\ncompetition and\njust missed out on\nqualifying. Once boats\nand equipment had been sorted, the\nteam all headed back to the house to\nenjoy dinner together. After a session\nvery early Saturday morning before the\nday\u2019s racing started, everyone spent the\nday relaxing, watching some of the other\nevents and preparing for the next day.\nThe first round, against Oxford\nBrookes, went smoothly with Imperial\nwinning by a comfortable margin.\nNow, with spirits in the crew verging\non nervously optimistic, despite any\nmention of actually winning being\ncompletely banned for fear of \u2018jinxing\u2019\nit, the girls rested up, awaiting the final\nrace. It was to be against the University\nof London, fellow tideway inhabitants\nand long-term rivals of Imperial.\nThe race did not\nstart as planned with\nUL getting an early\nlead and some steering\nissues throwing off\nthe rhythm. The crew\ncollected themselves,\nhowever and by\nhalfway had drawn\nback to level with\nshoutsofsupportfrom\nthe bank spurring\nthem on. Their momentum continued,\npulling them past the opposition and\ninto the lead. Now, with the finish\nline approaching, and the Imperial\ncrew still moving away it was not long\nbefore the race was over. This was a\nfirst win at Henley Women\u2019s for all the\ngirls in the four and an incredible end\nto the season for the women\u2019s squad.\nThis year Imperials men\u2019s squad had\nthree crews entered into the Temple\nChallenge Cup. This showed off the\ndepth of the Imperial squad as it had the\nmost athletes entered in the student\u2019s\neights event. The Temple Challenge Cup\nstarts on a Wednesday and the eventual\nwinner isn\u2019t decided until the Sunday.\nThe men\u2019s squad had some avenging\nto do as the last time the squad was at\nHenley, due to extremely difficult draws,\nevery crew entered got \u2018Wednesday-ed\u2019.\nHowever, this was not to be this year.\nAfter some grueling racing and a tough\nfive day schedule the Imperial 1st eight\nmade it to the final against a Dutch\ninternational crew ASR\nNereus.

    "content": "Trying to build a more sustainable\nworld can feel daunting and\nfull of loose ends. Perhaps that is the\nproblem:wearefixatedonusingtheterm\nbuild. When we think of building we\nthink of heavy infrastructure or scaling\nnew technologies from scratch. We do\nnot think of the more subtle solutions of\nthe natural world; a world that does not\nbuild but grows and recycles. It adapts.\nCarbon capture technologies have\nbeen receiving a lot of attention recently.\nOrca, the carbon removal plant housed\nin Iceland and conceived by the Swiss,\nstarteditsoperationsinearlySeptember.\nOrca inhales CO2 from the atmosphere,\nmixesitwithwaterandsendsitdeepinto\nthe earth\u2019s surface for it to mineralise.\nAnnually, the plant will extract\nroughly 4000 tonnes of CO2 emission.\nAccordingtoOurWorldinDatatheUK\nwas responsible for close to 370 million\ntonnes of CO2 in 2019. As you can see\nthere are some obvious scalability issues\nhere, particularly given the millions of\ndollars price tag.\nGiven the urgency of the climate\ncrisis we clearly cannot rely on these\ntechnologies alone. We don\u2019t even\nknow if there will be any second-order\neffects involved\nin the process,\nwhich would\ncertainly increase\nthe cost from a\nnon-pecuniar y\np e r s p e c t i v e .\nSusta inabil it y\nrequires working\nwith nature not\nsimply mimicking its processes.\nAnother well-documented form\nof carbon capture involves seaweed\nfarms. Not only does seaweed act as\na carbon sink but the algae is used\nin a number of foods, fertilisers and\ncosmetics. A charity called The Climate\nFoundation are hoping to incubate a\nmore productive growing environment\nfor seaweed by artificially upwelling the\nwater using various renewable-energy\npowered turbines. Whilst this provides\na more subtle form of geo-engineering\nthan Orca we again still don\u2019t know what\nthe local ecological impacts may be of\nthese turbines.\nProvided we expand our definition of\ntechnology we have a whole spectrum\nof carbon capture technologies. The\nrange being how symbiotic they are\nwith the natural world. In essence, are\nthey nature-based\nsolutions or not?\nPerhaps regenerative\nagriculture, which\ninvolves rebuilding\ncarbon-sequestering\ntopsoil by restoring its\ndegraded biodiversity,\nis a step closer to the\nsymbiosis. At least\nfor this we have a second-order effect of\nnutrient-dense food production.\nJulia Watson, an architect and expert\non nature-based design, spent years\ntravelling around the world to study\nindigenous technologies. An example\nbeing the deep-rooted tree bridges of\nthe Khasi people from Northern India;\nwhich tame the effects of the monsoon.\nThese solutions promote adaptation and\nsymbiosis with the natural world. Or\nin her words: \u2018Indigenous technologies\nadvance Darwin\u2019s theory from survival\nof the fittest to survival of the most\nsymbiotic.\u2019\nCarbon capture technologies such\nas Orca are easily marketable pieces\nof technology. Yet in regenerative\nagriculture it is not just the process\nmimicking the natural world, but the\nwhole operational design is built around\nthe natural system. Trying to sell this\nform of technology is perhaps a little\ntrickier. It is harder to market healthy\nsoil and seaweed than a carbon removal\nplant in Iceland. There is an asymmetry\nof publicity that perhaps doesn\u2019t reflect\nthe holistic efficacy of nature-based\nsolutions over current geo-engineering\nprojects.\nSo why does this matter? Well,\nwe need to consider the economic\nconcept of opportunity cost. Building a\nsustainable future cannot fall exclusively\nto engineering. Nor do we have the time\nor resources to do so. We have to way\nup the opportunity cost of our efforts.\nThe concept stems from our limited\nresources; time being one of them.\nWe need to expand our definition\nof technology when thinking about\nsolutionsastherewillnotbeonepanacea\nto climate change, let alone one silver\nbullet in tackling the CO2 problem.\nTechnology is not the monopoly of the\nlaboratory. We have to couple this with\nnature-based solutions.\nCreating a more sustainable world\nwill need to involve technologies\nfrom both the tacit knowledge that\nKarl Polanyi described as well as the\nmore explicit form of knowledge more\nprevalent in our classrooms. Tacit\nknowledge is found aplenty in nature-based solutions and is ubiquitous in\nindigenous technologies. The Orca\nplant is a manifestation of the more\nexplicit form of knowledge.\nSo what is the right balance when\nwe are looking at environmental\ntechnologies such as carbon capturing?\nIt is not just a question of engineering,\nbut of economics and ecology. Whilst\nwe should be looking to scale and\ndevelop technologies such as Orca we\nneed to find the Aristotelian mean\nbetween using these engineering feats as\nwell as those technologies that are more\nsymbiotic with the natural world. We\nneed to account for the second-order\neffects of such projects and consider not\njust net-zero, but sustainability beyond\nthis.\n\u2018Build Back Better\u2019 has been\ncaricatured and over-exhausted during\nthe Covid-19 pandemic. No one really\nknows what this means. However, if\nthe slogan includes trying to build a\nmore sustainable world then we likely\nneed to think about both adaptive\nand preventative technologies; both\nnature-based solutions and engineering\nsolutions.\nSustainability cannot be achieved by\nfurther distancing ourselves from the\nnatural world but by aligning with it.\nThealmostnegligibleimpactoftheOrca\nproject shows that we need nature-based\nsolutionsforbothshort-termadaptation\nand long-term sustainability.\nSustainability requires a broader\ndefinition of technology\nEnvironment.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nSeb Lawson Environment Writer\nTECHNOLOGY\nIS NOT THE\nMONOPOLY OF\nTHE LABORATORY\n\u201c\nFRIDAY 15TH OCTOBER 2021\n13\nEdited by: Monami Miyamoto\nEnvironment View online here!\nIndigenous communities can provide valuable nature-based solutions\nPhoto: Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n\n"

    "content": "Hidden Figures is a 2017 feature about 3 brilliant\nblack women who played a crucial role in the\nSpace Race between Russia and the US. Katherine\nJohnson, Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson were\noriginally \u00ab human computers \u00bb at the NASA Langley Research Center which means that they calculated\nby hand everything they would be asked to. At the be-ginning, it was mostly men that did this job but there\nwas a shift at some point because companies realized\nthat women (and - truth be told - any minority) could\nbe paid less to do exactly the same job.\nTobeginwith,KatherineJonhsonwasamathematician\nand a physicist who computed the Apollo 11 mission\u2019s\ntrajectory. Given her incredible math skills, she was\nasked to join a Space Task Group where she was the\nonly Black woman. In a famous episode, the astronaut\nJohn Glenn asked her to double check the trajectory\nof his mission, the Friendship 7 one, because he\ndid not trust digital computers. With her help, this\nmission made him the first American to orbit Earth.\nSecondly,DorothyVaughnwasamathematicianwho\nbecame NASA\u2019s first African-American supervisor.\nWhen NASA bought their first IBM computers, it\nsaid to threatened the job of \u00ab human computers \u00bb.\nDorothy Vaughn thus decided to learn programming\n(FORTRAN, for those familiar with computer\nscience) and soon became much better than the\nwhite men in charge of the IBM machine. She passed\nher knowledge to her fellow black women \u00ab human\ncomputers \u00bb, and saved their jobs. Not only that, but\nshe also taught the white men who were dismissing\nher before, as is seen at the beginning of the feature.\nLastly, Mary Jackson was NASA\u2019s first female\nAfrican-American engineer. She applied for the\nposition and was told that she needed extra-classes in order to get the position. Those classes\nwere held in an all-white school so she took the\nmatter to the court and won the right to attend the\nnight classes and learn just like any other student.\nThe film takes place in the \u201860s when Black\nworkforce were not allowed to use the same bathrooms\nas white people so if you choose to watch this film,\nyou find absurd scenes were Katherine Jonhson is\nforced to go to another building to use the toilets\nbecause there is no \u00ab coloured bathroom \u00bb in the\nbuilding she is working in. Hidden Figures is not a\nsad movie, in fact it\u2019s the contrary, a movie full of\nhope that will not fail to inspire you. Overall, the\nfilm portrays the hardships minorities face to get\ntheir voices heard in the scientific community as well\nas also emphasizing the recognition they slowly get.\nNext time someone says we lack important\nhistorical women and/or black figures,\nremind them of the \u00ab hidden figures \u00bb !\nHidden figures\nFilm Review\nFRIDAY 15TH OCTOBER 2021\nEdited by: Eva Borras\nFilm\nFilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk 27\nAur\u00e9lia Bordes Film Writer\nDirectedby: Theodore Melfi\nStarring: Taraji P.

    "content": "KEEP THE CAT FREE\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\n8\nARTS\nI\ndentity, in particular cultural identity, is an interesting notion. Shaped by our community and\na shared upbringing, it is as much an individual\nconcept as it is societal. We can claim one but\nare almost always inevitably given another by society\n(and that usually ends up being the one that sticks!). As\nmuch as we may seek to rewrite it, the detritus of our\npast seeps into us and colours us for all it\u2019s worth. This\nis particularly true for certain communities and nationalities that historically (and even now) face a multitude\nof barriers to adopting an identity of their own. Neither\ntime nor accent, education nor shared culture is seen\ncapable enough to unshackle this established notion.\nMalindadzimu, written by Mufara Makubika and\ndirected by Monique Touko, treads on this delicate\nsubject, and bit more, at Hampstead Theatre! Hope\n(played with youth by Kudzai Mangombe) grows\nup in Nottingham, the daughter of a Rhodes scholar\nfrom Zimbabwe, Faith (played by Shyko Amos), who\nhas chosen to make England her home and country!\nThat is until a set of wholly unconvincing circumstances changes her mind, and she moves back to a farm in\nZimbabwe with her teenage daughter. The play then\nfollows the duo as they choose and struggle to reconnect with their lost heritage and identity, waited on by\nnative house help Gogo (played by the ecstatic Natasha Williams). There are other sub-plot lines involving Cecil Rhodes and his enduring legacy (and mau-soleum) in modern Zimbabwe and Lobengula (Sifiso\nMazibuko); however, it is a little girl\u2019s quest to find and\ndefine her identity that sits at the heart of the play.\nThe play is executed in a small stage bound by pews\ntwo or three rows deep on three sides. The set design\nis somewhat minimalistic, the stage populated for the\nmost part by only a table and a few chairs that are put to\nfluid use craftily. A translucent screen on the backdrop\nserves up the Zimbabwean farmland and the countryside aesthetic to moderate success.\nDriven by strong performances \u2013 none better than\nNatasha Williams as Gogo \u2013 the play feels intimate and\nresembles a small, very real, and messy family drama\nunfolding right in front of our eyes. The dialogues are\noften didactic yet always feel rooted and authentic to\nthe characters. However, the writing feels loose at stages and the plot lines fail to converge at the end to give\na convincing closure to the subject matter dealt with.\nPerhaps what offers this story a poignancy and intimacy is exactly what holds it back as well. The small\nstage and makeshift set transitions, during which the\ncharacters, for an all too brief moment, fumble about\nas they set up the stage for the next act. In these chang-es, they render themselves no longer as Faith, Hope\nor Lobengula\u2013with their perfect African accents and\ndialects\u2013but as stagehands from London. This break\nin character and flow for a play executed in such small\nquarters is maybe to be expected and can almost be forgiven \u2014 but the lack of crispness in the script expounds\nthis to such an extent that you are left to wonder where\nan act ends and where it begins. Is this an interlude or\nis this part of the play?\nSitting outside the theatre hall reading the synopsis again, I was thrown back to an LBC radio sound\nbite from summer of 2020 featuring Labour MP David Lammy passionately trying to convince otherwise\na well-spoken, educated, and articulate \u2018Englishwoman\u2019 who was claiming that he was not English but that\nhe could be (he \u2018was not\u2019, but could be) British. Such\nevents\u2013vivid in our memory from that dreadful summer of 2020\u2013underscore the immediacy and the potency of the subject matter being dealt with here. And\nunfortunately, that is one responsibility this play has\ncertainly neglected by attempting too many plot lines\nand not fleshing them out enough.\nIn all earnest, this is \u2018bold and experimental\u2019 small\ntheatre! And thus, along with it are all the tropes that\none would expect and come to require of it. Go expecting that and only that and you won\u2019t be disappointed.\nBut, on the other hand, if you want a telling exposition\nof the intricacies of cultural and national identities in\nthe 21st century, it is only all too well to skip Malindadzimu!\nCultural identity at play!\nReviewed by Vaidhiswaran Ramesh Arts Editor\nMalindadzimu\nWhere? Hampstead Theatre\nWhen? Until 30th October, 2021\nHowmuch? From \u00a35\nTheatre\nCredits: Photo/Robert Day\nNatasha Williams steels the show as Gogo!\n\n"

Later on, a\nfriend of mine told me about the\nother Talk Talk album that came\nout after Spirit. Laughing Stock was\ndarker than its predecessor. It was\ndistressing to listen to at times; it had\nthe lowest lows and highest highs\nof any album I\u2019d heard. By the time\nTalk Talk had released Laughing Stock, they\u2019d faded\nfrom the significance that their pop roots had given\nthem, and they were down a bassist. They split soon\nafter its release. Whether the media and record labels\nrecognised it, though, they\u2019d just released two albums\nthat would define alt-rock and post-rock in the future.\nBut Hollis still had one more thing to get off his chest\nbefore he\u2019d retire from music and fame for good.\nEnter Mark Hollis.

In Mark\u2019s own words,\n\u201cWhen I saw it for the first time I had to laugh, but\nthere\u2019s also something tragic about it at the same time.\u201d\nListening to this after the previous two records feels\nlike you\u2019ve finally escaped whatever hell or heaven\nwas happening in those albums, and you\u2019ve found\na precarious peace somewhere. The opening track\ngreets you with silence, followed a soft, quiet piano,\naccompanying a quiet hum from Hollis. \u2018The Colour\nof Spring\u2019 \u2013 the track shares a name with Talk Talk\u2019s\nlast widely successful album, although it doesn\u2019t share\nmuch else with its namesake: the only sounds for the\nmajority of the playtime are that quiet piano, and\nHollis\u2019 nigh indiscernible singing occasionally roaring\ninto a louder shout, only to dip down in volume once\nmore.\nOther tracks infuse Hollis\u2019 jazz influences with a\nmore traditional acoustic guitar-based rock. \u2018Inside\nLooking Out\u2019 and \u2018The Gift\u2019 have both, in different\nways.Theformerstartsoffquietlyandintimatelylikethe\nopening track, before building in timbre with Hollis\u2019s\nvoice, ending with a small chorus of clarinets playing so\nquietly you can hear the wind blowing through them\nmore than the actual note. \u2018The Gift\u2019 kicks off with a\nsteady drum rhythm, with the same\nguitar and bass working together to\ncreate a noticeably slightly sinister\natmosphere, with a small whoop\nhere and there on the harmonica to\ncompliment Mark\u2019s softly spoken\nwords \u2013 sounding here almost like\na threat. The track finishes messily\nwith the same chorus of discordant\nwoodwind instruments, leading\nperfectly into the next track.\nThe rest of the album passes like\na dream, hand held by Hollis\u2019 voice as he guides you\nthrough a quiet portrait of still life, contemplation,\nregret and hope. My personal standout is what I\u2019d\nconsider to be the best example\nof Hollis\u2019 fusion of the styles\nthat inspired him throughout his\ncareer. \u2018The Daily Planet\u2019 could be\nconfused for a jazz tune as it starts,\nwithvariouswoodwindinstruments\nplaying with each other in the\notherwise silent recording studio.\nThen with the introduction of some\ndrums, and a bass accompanying\nthe constant droning of the\nwoodwinds in a discordant dance,\nit becomes hard to guess where\nthe lead clarinet might be heading\nnext. Just as you\u2019re starting to figure\nit out, the guitar and piano kick\nin, with Hollis leading the charge.\nThe chord progression in the verse\nis gorgeous, and the jarring change\nfrom the woodwinds to this leaves you a little taken\naback \u2013 even though only a few instruments have\nchanged places here. As the song fizzles out after the\nlastverse,wegetashakyandemotionalcoda.\u201cHurtsto\nsee, over undertone,\u201d Hollis whispers over just a couple\nof clarinets and bassoons, \u201cShame, last to laugh, no.\u201d\nThe song is seen out by a few seemingly random notes\nfrom the woodwind section, lingering on a dissonant\nguitar chord as long as it possibly can.\nMark Hollis is peculiar, in the sense that I love it\njust as much as the two preceding Talk Talk records,\nthough it feels profoundly separate\nand removed from them both. My\nfriendwhorecommendedLaughing\nStock didn\u2019t gel with this album at\nall. And I don\u2019t know anyone who\nfeels the same unspeakable love for\nit as I do. But I still believe if there\u2019s\nany record which proves what an\nincredible musician Hollis was,\nit\u2019s his self-titled solo effort. After\nLaughing Stock, Mark Hollis feels\nopen and light \u2013 the opposite of its\npredecessor. It\u2019s the final word of a\nmusician frustrated by fame, whose\nonly intent was to create some art\nandbedonewithit.Anddonewith\nit he was \u2013 Hollis retreated from\nthe fame he got from Talk Talk,\nspending the rest of his life in peace and quiet with his\nfamily. He faded from the public eye until his death in\n2019.\nMark Hollis by Mark Hollis\nWritten by Ben Bateman Music Writer\nFelix Recommends\n\u201c\nIT\u2019S THE FINAL\nWORD OF A\nMUSICIAN\nFRUSTRATED BY\nFAME, WHOSE\nONLY INTENT\nWAS TO CREATE\nSOME ART AND BE\nDONE WITH IT\n\u201c\nTHEY\u2019D JUST\nRELEASED TWO\nALBUMS THAT\nWOULD DEFINE\nALT-ROCK\n\n"

The crispness, clear theme, and undeniably sensational cast won me over. These aspects coalesced into a\ncoherent and sharp production that can only be attributed to the overall direction (Michael Cottrell). This\nplay is the debut production from the Dissident Theatre Company, and I am excited to see what comes next!\nSnowflakes is certainly a play for any sci-fi fan with a\ndark side and it definitely gets my recommendation.\nFRIDAY 15TH OCTOBER 2021\n7\nARTS\nArts.felix@imperial.ac.uk Felixonline.co.uk\nT\nhe experience begins when you step on board\nthe lifts on the right hand-side of the Tate\nModern ticket office. The doors close behind\nyou and you\u2019re inside a Roald Dahl-esque box that\ncould take you anywhere. Out of Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory, into space, or maybe into a tropical land-scape. But the doors open again and you alight into\nYayoi Kusama\u2019s landscape of lights and patterns.\nKusama, a now 92 year old Japanese artist, has created art since a young age. Walking through the ever-so-brief but ever-so-enchanting exhibition we come to\nlearn that art is not the only thing that has followed\nKusama\u2019s steps since a young age. Since a little girl, she\nhas also experienced hallucinations. Realising this,\nKusama\u2019s art makes more sense. Her art is the physical\nembodiment of her hallucinations. Being known for\nher so-called \u201cInfinity rooms\u201d, of which this exhibition\nhas the joy to contain two of, she creates art for more\nthan just one of the senses. She creates an experience.\nThe two rooms in this exhibition have queues forming in front of them. Signs warning the public about\nwhat they\u2019re about to experience are present, \u201cBeware\nof flashing lights\u201d, \u201cIf disoriented, look to the ceiling\u201d\nor \u201cDon\u2019t step into the shallow pools of water\u201d. When\nentering the second room the museum worker is again\nseparately warning everyone about falling into the wa-ter. \u201cIt happens everyday, even with a warning\u201d she says.\nAt this point we\u2019re almost excited about the potential\ndangers of what we are about to experience. The reality is slightly less intense than all the warnings make it\nout to be. I wouldn\u2019t call it \u201cunderwhelming\u201d, just a lot\n\u201cless\u201d than expected. The rooms are a lot smaller too, in\ncomparison to pictures seen prior, popping up on my\ninstagram feed every now and then. However, looking\nback at my own pictures afterwards the mirrors and reflective surfaces would have me fooled all over again.\nOther than the rooms there are some miscellaneous\nphotos of Yayoi, capturing her whilst simultaneously\ncreating and taking part in her own art. There\u2019s nudity,\nthere\u2019s paint, there\u2019s flashing lights. There\u2019s a slight element of insanity in every bit of it. This falls into place\nwhen we find out that Kusama admitted herself to a\nmental hospital in 1977, and has lived there ever since.\nIt is a partial relief to step out of the exhibition into a\nmore sane world, having tasted a little bit of Kusama\u2019s\ninsane reality.\nTo the Infinity Room and beyond\nReviewed by Amanda Hertzberg Arts Writer\nYayoi Kusama: Infinity\nMirror Rooms\nWhere?
