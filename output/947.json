    "content": "'eat ure6 November 1992 Felix 947\nDramSoc at Work and Play\nLife in DramSoc is far from quiet, from the big bangs of a pyrotechnic\nworkshop to the Edinburgh Fringe.\n'If you hold one of these while\ndetonating it will take off your arm\n- at least' says Andrew, DramSoc's stage director, while he carefully\nlowers a theatrical 'giant size'\nmaroon by its wires into an iron bin.\nWe are standing on the grid above\nthe stage of the Concert Hall\npreparing the workshop on\npyrotechnics. Downstairs Mylan,\nwho will give the workshop, is\nworking chemical powders into\ncigarette-like devices that will\nproduce discharges of coloured\nflames.\nThe workshop begins with an\nintroduction to the various basic\ncomponents of pyrotechnics:\nblack powder, flash powder, magnesium, etc. and how they\nproduce certain effects. I have\nnever been very good with\nchemicals, so I only understand\nabout half of it. It becomes\nentertaining when Mylan sets fire\nto some heaps of powder either by\nblack powder fuses or electrical\ndischarge. Flashes and different\ncoloured torches go off\naccompanied by many s s ssh hh he s and wo u ffs very nice!\nThen he demonstrates the\ndifferent effects that a small amount\nof black powder can have. Just\npoured onto the floor it burns away\nrather un interestingly. But from a one foot gas pipe, sealed at one end,\nyou can blast a water filled condom\nhigh into the air, sprinkling the\nwhole stage with drops (just in case\nyou ever feel the urge to advertise\ncondoms or are in need of a two\nsecond 'rain'). One of the giant\nmaroons mentioned earlier\nproduces a 'real loud bang' and\nattracts the undivided attention of\ntwo police vans patrolling the\n'Support The Miners'\ndemonstration. (The second maroon\nsent two officers circling the Union\nBuilding on foot, looking rather\nworried.)\nAfter explaining the basic\nmechanisms of fireworks, how you\ncan make them produce nice pattern\nof stars and so on, the audience is\ninvited to mix up their own special\neffects, which filled the hall with\nthick smoke and the session ended\ndue to bad light l Iff* ll l fe* \u2022w mmm S Sm. MB*. \u2022>;\u2022 / '\nmm\nAll the workshops this term and\nmuch much more\nAnother workshop organised by the\nDramatic Society took place on the\nweekend of the 24th and 25th October. This essentially consisted\nof the setting up of a theatre in the\nUnion Dining Hall in which to\nperform a play. It was similar to\nTheatre West End (the venue run\nduring the Edinburgh Fringe\nFestival). While the 'tech ies' were\nbusy building the theatre, the actors\nrehearsed the one act play 'Ernie's Incredible Illucinations'. This was\nperformed in front of an audience\non the Sunday.\nMore workshops of this kind will\nprobably be run, since this one\nproved to be lots of fun for both\nthose interested in the technical\naspects of the theatre and those\ninterested in acting.\nWatch out for posters or phone\n3531 for more information. Better\nstill, why not come and visit us in\nthe DramSoc storeroom (4th floor\nof the Union Building, east\nstaircase) any lunchtime, or join us\non Tuesday evenings in Da Vinci's. And remember, during\nDecember we will be staging\nShakespeare's 'Twelfth Night', so if\nyou wish to help out with that, come\nto \u2022 our production meetings on\nThursdays at 5.30pm in the Green\nCommittee Room (top floor of the\nUnion Building).\nPage 10\n\n"

    "content": "N ews\n6 November 1992 Felix 947\nAlert Staff Awards\nby Tanya Z Nizam\nReports about a bomb planted in the\ncollege caused evacuation on\nMonday 2nd November. On\nreceiving the alert, College security\narranged for a section of the College\nto be evacuated. The scare,\nThis week saw the opening meeting\nof the University of London\nGeneral Union Council (GUC).\nGU C is the senior decision\nmaking body of UL U, and as such\nis attended by representatives of all\nthe London colleges, including\nImperial, who sent four delegates\nincluding Chris Davidson, ICU\nPresident.\nThe major debate was a motion\nto prevent UL U from carrying out\nillegal Ultra Vires activities, in the\nwake of legal action against other\nunions which had resulted in\nsubstantial personal expense to\nunion officers. The motion was\npassed after a short debate.\nhowever, turned out to be a false\nalarm. According to security,\n'certain identified flaws' in the\nsecurity system have come to light\nas a result of the alert. Steps are\nnow reportedly being taken to\nimprove the system.\nAlso in the meeting, the post of\nAccommodation and Halls Officer\nand a place on the Committee on\nStudent Activities and Management\nwere elected. A Postgraduate and\nMature Students Officer was not\nelected as the candidate standing\nlost to 'Reopen Nominations' the\nUL Ue qui val ant of 'New Election'.\nSubjects not discussed at the\nmeeting was the matter of colleges\nd is affiliating from the University of\nLondon, and Voluntary\nMembership which are considered\nby many Senior members of UL U to be the most pressing matter\nfacing the union.\nby Declan Curry\nProfessor Roy Anderson, the head\nof Imperial's Biology Department,\nhas announced his resignation. He\nwill leave on 30 September 1993 to\ntake up a new post as Linacre\nProfessor of Zoology at Oxford\nUniversity. Sir Eric Ash, College\nRector, is to begin consultations on\nhis successor.\nProfessor Anderson was born in\n1947 and graduated in zoology at\nImperial in 1968. A noted AIDS\nand HIV expert, he is also director\nof the Welcome Research Centre\nfor Parasitic Infections, based at\nSouth Kensington. The Centre,\nestablished with a \u00a3 4 million grant\nfrom Welcome, has six staff and\nfifty post-doctoral researchers.\nProfessor Anderson is also visiting\nprofessor at the Institute of\nParasitology at University of\nMcGill, and has been invited this\nweek to give the 1994 Royal\nSociety's Croonian Prize Lecture.\nColleagues in Imperial's Biology\nDepartment have congratulated\nProfessor Anderson on his\nappointment, with some expressing\nregret at the move. He has\npreviously worked at Oxford as an\nIBM Research Fellow, and replaces\nSir Richard Southwood, the current\nvice chancellor of Oxford. Sir\nRichard will continue to hold a personal chair in the Zoology\nDepartment.\nIn other announcements,\nProfessor David Blow, Head of the\nDepartment of Physics, has been\nelected as a Membre Associe\nEtranger of the Academie des\nSciences in Paris. Speaking to\nFelix, Professor Blow described the\nappointment as 'an unexpected\nhonour' that he was 'proud to\nhave'. He added that he had done\nsome considerable work in France,\nand he thought that he had been\nproposed for the membership by\nthose who were aware of his work\nand wanted to 'show some\nappreciation for it'.\nGUC Report\nDepartment denies Tomlinson to be shelved\nby Declan Curry\nThe Department of Health has\nrefused to comment on claims that\npart of the Tomlinson report is to\nbe shelved as a result of public\nspending negotiations. David\nBlunkett, Labour's Shadow Health\nSecretary, said that he is\n'pessimistic' about government\nplans to invest in basic family\ndoctor health care. 'If anything\nhappens at all, it's going to be\nclosure rather than re investment', he said. A spokesman for the\nDepartment of Health said that they\nhad 'no comment to make on the\nmatter'.\nThe Tomlinson Report was\ndrawn up by Sir Bernard Tomlinson\nafter a year long inquiry into the\nprovision of health care in London.\nThe main recommendations of the\n256 paragraph report are the closure\nof St. Bartholomew's, Charing\nCross and Queen Charlotte's Hospitals. The University College\nHospital and the Middlesex\nHospital are to be 'downsized', with\nboth hospitals merging on one site.\nThe Royal National Throat, Nose\nand Ear Hospital and the Hospital\nfor Tropical Diseases will both be\nclosed and their functions\ntransferred to the new University\nCollege - Middlesex Hospital.\nFacilities at Bart's Hospital are to\nbe transferred to the Royal London\nHospital site. St. Thomas's and\nGuy's Hospitals will also be merged\nonto one site.\nThe number of beds at St. Mary's Hospital will be reduced and part\nof the site sold.

Special Health\nAuthorities (SHA), which cover\nspecialist hospitals such as Great\nOrmond Street Hospital for Sick\nChildren, will be rational is ed and\nopened to the health service internal\nmarket. SHAs were created to\nprovide a level of shelter from the\nfree market until the hospitals were\ndeemed ready to openly compete\nfor patients.\nThe Tomlinson Report also calls\nfor 'better primary and community\nhealth care' to accompany the\nrational is ation of the hospital sector.\nAfter publishing his report, Sir\nBernard Tomlinson said that 'there\nneeds to be a shift in the focus of\nhealth services in London.\nInsufficient attention is paid to the\nhealth services delivered in the\ncommunity by GPs, health visitors\nand others. More money needs to\nbe put into improving GPs premises\nand into boosting the work of\nprimary health care teams.' This\ndevelopment of primary family\ndoctor services has been costed at\n\u00a3140 million, though independent\nexperts expect the final total to be\nthree or four times that. It is this\nexpenditure which is being\nsqueezed in the current government\nspending round, the tightest for\nmany years. Economists have\nwarned ministers not to cut the level\nof capital (building) spending in a bid to end the recession.\nThe Tomlinson report was\nwelcomed by the British Medical\nAssociation (BMA) and by London\nRegional Health Authorities. Dr.\nJohn Chawner, chairman of the\nBMA's Consultants' Committee,\nsaid 'the problems of over-provision in London have been\napparent for some time' and added\nthat closures needed to be\nimplemented 'in a planned way, not\nas a result of the market'. T am\nquite certain that some consultants\nwill fight but we won't join that\nfight', said Dr. Chawner. Virginia\nBeardshaw, the director of\nindependent health think tank,\nKing's Fund London Initiative, said\nthat the closures would lead to\n'better services', and condemned\nthe 'propaganda war' over the\nrecommendations.\nAnother of Tomlinson's proposals is to merge London's nine\nmedical schools onto four sites.\nMedical education at Imperial is to\nbe expanded with the addition of\nCharing Cross Westminster\nHospital Medical School, the\nInstitute of Cancer Research, the\nNational Heart and Lung Institute\nand the Royal Postgraduate Medical\nSchool. The Executive Committee\nof Imperial's Governing Body have\nexpressed their approval of the\nrecommendations. In a statement,\nthey say that the 'planned final\nphase of redevelopment of St.\nMary's is sound', and welcome the\nproposals 'to enlarge medicine\nwithin the College by fully\nintegrating St Mary's with the\nCharing Cross and Westminster\nSchool to form a new Imperial\nSchool of Medicine'.\nThe Tomlinson report has been\ndenounced by left wing pressure\ngroup London Health Emergency\n(LHE). John Lister, Information\nDirector of L HE, said that they\nwere working on a 'detailed\nresponse' to the report, and that he\nwas pleased by the 'localised\ncampaigns' against the closures. Mr Lister added that there had been a 'massive public response' to the\nL HE Health Hotline, with members\nof the public phoning on 081 543\n5914 for a free information pack.\nPage 2\n\n"

This\ninvolved some thirty members of\nImperial College Union's Dramatic\nSociety who were determined to\nhave some fun, and was achieved\nwith considerable success.\nTheory\nThe Edinburgh Festival\nincorporates festivals of Street\nTheatre, Jazz, Film, a Military\nTattoo and the Festival Fringe,\nwhich is a subtle blend of comedy,\ncabaret and theatre. It takes place\nduring three weeks each August;\nthis year saw the tenth anniversary\nof DramSoc's involvement.\nMethod\nDramSoc hired a hall on the west\nend of Princes Street, which is one\nof the main shopping areas of\nEdinburgh. In a mere five days it\nwas transformed into Theatre West\nEnd, a Fringe venue, by a team of\nstudents who perhaps hadn't been\nable to find paid work during the\nsummer, or they'd maybe taken\nAugust out in order to be at the\nFestival. Let's face it, some of us\nweren't even members of\nDramSoc.\nThe theatre housed two of\nDramSoc's own productions, which\nthis year were 'Teechers' by John\nGodber and 'The Warden of the\nTomb' by Franz Kafka, and was\nsublet to other theatre companies\nfor the rest of the time.\nResults\nThe venue has a record of high\nstandards, with sublets returning\ntime and again. This year, the\nCambridge Mummers were\nshortlisted for the Guardian's International Student Drama Award\nfor their production of 'Magic Jack'\nat Theatre West End. Dramsoc's own performances were also well\nreceived, with 'Teechers' drawing\nlarge audiences and 'The Warden\nof the Tomb' being reviewed in The\nStage]\nConclusion\nThe aim of the venture was to have\nfun; being in Edinburgh during the\nfestival was superb. Once the\nfestival had begun, only a few hours\na day were spent working at the\nvenue, leaving the rest of the day\nfree. The accommodation was\nspacious and sub sidi sed, and as\nFringe performers, we joined the\nFringe Club (aka the Students'\nUnion Building of Edinburgh\nUniversity). This had three bars and\nfree bands and cabaret and\neverything and it didn't stop serving\ndrinks until three o 'clock in the\nmorning!

There are several\nseminar rooms, and also easy\naccess and facilities for the\ndisabled.\nThe plan is to have two lecture\ntracks of four or five lectures a day\ncovering all aspects of the space\nfield, just a few examples are\n'Space is good for you' by\nProfessor Heinz Wolff, 'The big\nbang' by Dr Lewis Ryder,\n'Terraforming' by Mr Martyn\nFogg, 'Solar sails' by Mr Colin\nJack, 'A day in the life of an\nastronaut' by Mr David Shayler and\n'Space law' by Professor Francis\nLyall. In the other lecture theatre\nthere will be continuous\npresentations in Starlab, and\ninflatable planetarium. In the\nParachuting\nseminar rooms and the main foyer\nthere will be stands and displays\nfrom universities and space\nindustries from all over the country\nto look at throughout the day, and\nduring the half an hour breaks\nbetween all lectures.

As well as being a lot of fun,\nthe weekend should prove very\ninformative and educational.\nLate Saturday afternoon, society\nissues will be discussed and the new\nnational Committee will be elected\nat the Annual General Meeting.

It's always a tough one to answer. Will I get a strange look if I describe the\nabsolute panic that grips me every\ntime I get ready to exit the aircraft.\nDoing something because it scares\nyou is not normal behaviour. OK, so maybe I'm not normal.\nIC Parachute and Skydiving Club\nwill give you the chance to try\nparachuting on a weekend course\nwhich ends with your first static line\nparachute descent. To fill you in,\nhere's a couple of stories...\nI suppose my instructor though it\nwas a joke when I asked 'What\nhappens if both parachutes fail?'\nand he answered 'You go in.', 'Go\nin where?' 'Just in.' Whatever it\nwas, 'going in' didn't sound good,\nso I resolved not to do it.\nFortunately I didn't, and here I am\nto tell the tale...\nSince that first jump, I have\nprogressed (slowly) on to free fall,\na totally different rush to those first\nfew 'static line' jumps, when your\nparachute opens for you. As they\nsay about most enjoyable activities,\nsuch as sex, drugs and booze, the\nfirst time is always the best. So\nhere's what it was like for me...\nI put my rig on and sat quiet and\nalone on the bench, slowly going\nover my reserve drills. We were\nslowly led out to get into the plane.\nMy first time in a light aircraft, and\nI wasn't going to land with it!\nClimbing to jump height was OK,\nthe familiar ear popping sensation\nbut there was no hostess handing\nout the boiled sweets. The Jump\nMaster opened the door and the\nnoise and cold were a real surprise.\nI was first out. I slid across and\npoked my toes over the edge of the\ndoor. I got into the correct position\nand the Jump Master said 'Go', and\nI went. There followed five seconds\nof sensory overload and suddenly\nlike magic, this large hankie over\nmy head and a sort of quiet and\ncalm, in total contrast to the noise\nof the exit. There is time in the air\nto enjoy the view before preparing\nto land. Landing itself involves the\nunexpected ground rush then a feeling not unlike being hit by a London Bus on a good day for\ntraffic.\nThe only answer anyone gets now\nto the 'What's it like?' questions is\n'Try it!'. The club hopes to have its\nfirst course together pretty soon.\nThe cost is around \u00a385 for the\nweekend training and your first\njump plus a few extras for club\nmembership and transport. If you\ncan raise \u00a3170 in sponsorship, the\nYachting-An Intro\n1) hire a yacht or two. 2) organise\nthe crews. 3) organise the transport.\n4) always carry a phone card or an\nold lOp piece, in order to phone a snoozing captain. 5) check the tyre\npressures in case of four conflicting\nvalves. 6) buy lots of food; anything\nwith chocolate goes down\nextremely well. (Incidentally,\nnothing came back up, although\nsome people did appear to be\ndoubting the law of gravity).\nTo the sailing; Lymington to\nCowes, Cowes to Lymington. It's very straightforward. The captains\nare very experienced, very patient\nand have a sense of humour to jolly\nalong some of the crew who may\nlack insight into what is happening\n(myself for example). Experienced\ncrew help the captains maintain\nsanity.\nIn bright sunlight, not too much\nwind and calm waters we sailed to\nCowes. Pop up the main sail and\nspinnaker, then Bob's your uncle.\nSlacken/tighten a rope continuously\nand you're sailing.

Then\nback to Lymington in one piece.\nSort of. One person decided to test\nthe temperature of the water with\nthe lower half of his body; another\ndecided at the last minute not to\nallow the mainsail to propel him\noverboard.\nFuture editions shall discuss\n'fashion and sailing, are the two\nsynonymous?', 'Man overboard,\nwhat to do'; 'Cooking, a sailors\nguide' and 'ropes, a quick guide for\nthe colour blind'.\nSo, many thanks to my fellow\nsailors for such a brilliant weekend.\nI shall hopefully be allowed to join\nthem on future trips.\nFilmsoc\nThis week's presentation by\nFilmSoc is Father of the Bride,\nstarring Steve Martin (LA Story,\nRoxanne). The film concerns the\ntrials and tribulations of an overprotective father preparing for his\nonly daughter's wedding to Martin\nShort (3 Amigos, 3 Fugitives). It is\na remake of the 1950s classic and\nis full of the fast, witty humour that\nwe have come to expect from Steve\nMartin. The pre nuptial pandemonium includes the first\nchaotic meeting with the in laws and\na variety of comic situations which\neventually sees Martin in jail. The\nfilm, directed by Charles Shyer,\ndemonstrates brilliantly the comic\nstyle and genius of Steve Martin,\ncontinuing in the same mould as the\nhugely successful Parenthood.\nFor an evening of side-splitting\nhumour, come along to Mech Eng\n220 on Thursday 12th November at\n7.30pm. Membership costs \u00a36.50\nwith the first film free, and 90p thereafter, and entry for nonmembers is \u00a31.90.\ncourse is free. Subsequent jumps\nare sub sidi sed so are a bargain if\nyou want to become a Skygod! You\ncan also do a Tandem Skydive\nwhich is a little more expensive but\ninvolves a40 second free fall\nattached to a qualified instructor.\nWe jump at Peterborough\nParachute Centre, one of the best\nand safest in the country (make sure\nyou tell your parents that).\nFor more details, come and see\nus in the Brown Committee Room\n12.30-1.00 on any Monday. And by\nthe way, don't ask the 'What's it\nlike?' question.\nPage 15\n\n"

However\nwe always looked likely to break the\nimpasse and with our corr usc a ting set plays we scored a well deserved\nsecond 'go-ahead' goal with only 10\nminutes remaining.\nWe all held on to our huge loads,\nwith Simon ' G in' Curwood\nperforming well in goal and 'Muff\nDiver' Higgin, in his last\nappearence, doing well in defence.\nSimon, for his storming\nperformance on the right wing, was\nawarded our quacking mascot - the\neyeless duck called Blow Job. Our\nteams goals aided our bid for U AU champions.\nAn irate 2nd XI asked me to\ncorrect the score published last\nweek. They scored twice in the first\n15 minutes against King's and were\nalways the dominant side. The\nresult was IC 2nd XI 2 v0 King's College.\nRugby Wins\nImperial College Rugby First XV Imperial College continued their\nUniversity Athletics Union (UAU)\nwinning way by beating Brunei\n17-13 at Uxbridge.\nThe game started in hectic\nfashion as IC conceded the\nobligatory three point penalty five\nminutes into the game.\nThey struck back on the twenty\nminute mark with a slick handling\nmovement where Anton Fields put\nDave Bolton in for his first try of\nthe season. This was converted and\nwas followed by a period of heavy\npressure by the IC forwards,\nculminating in a converted penalty\ntry when the Brunei pack dived in\nthe scrum to stop Simon Pearson\ntouching down. Another penalty by\nBrunei brought the half to a close\nwith IC 14-6 up.\nThe second half was a scrappy\naffair with Brunei narrowing the\ndeficit, with a converted try, to\n14-13.\nDebutante Mark Ashford\nnarrowly missed a drop goal before\nStuart Paynter kicked a penalty to\ncomplete the scoring. George Habib\nreplaced Roger Gilchrist with ten\nminutes to go and IC held on for a hard fought win.\nImperial College Rugby Second XV ICRFC 8 Brunei 5\nAt last the seconds earned the win\nwhich reflects their efforts. Lead\nfrom the centre of the scrum by\nCaptain Rich (Chunky) Cleniey, the\nrest of the front row - Si Fuller and\nMark Jackson, had an excellent\ngame. Rucks and Malls were\npowerfully won by the rampaging\nJohn Cassidy and unstoppable Keith\nSimpson on the flank complemented\nby a powerful second row and\nspeedy number eight.\nA try in the first ten minutes by Lee\nJefferson (un converted) set the\npre c ident for the rest of the game,\nmore trys were deserved but\nun forthcoming. The penalty kick\nwas also taken by Lee's immaculate\nboot. Unfortunately a try was\nconceded in the last few moments,\nbut IC's relentless energy and effort\nwas finally payed off at the final\nwhistle.\nThe game was free flowing and\nlovely Rugby to watch, a fitting\nresult considering our last few, hard\nfought, defeats.\n(Karl Drage, Vice Captain)\nImperial College Rugby meet every\nSunday at 12, Monday at 6 and\nTuesday at 12 in the Union Gym.\nIC T. Tennis\nBrunei v Imperial\nAt 12.45 there was panic as two of\nour best players couldn't play. Two\nreserves were quickly found. It\nseemed as though, after a152 win\nin our first match (Mathias Stolpe,\nMark Green and Richie Lam all\nunbeaten) we were now going to\nstruggle to win. However Mathias\nkept his unbeaten record, Guy\nPlowman scored 3/4 and Richie\nLam and Prakash Rajn each scored\n2/4. Richie and Mathias added the\ndoubles for a more than satisfactory\n12-5 win.\nBuffalo Trip\nALL REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS\nYou could win a national competition and a trip to\nAmerica for the Student Games by reporting for your\nstudent newspaper's sports page.\nThe Independant newspaper and the\nBritish Students Sports Federation\nare offering two students the chance\nto cover the World Student Games\nin the United States next year.

This\nwas followed by the first showing\nof the Rocky Horror Picture Show\nfilm, which was repeated all night\nin Da Vinci's. The rest of the night\nwas taken up with a disco until\n1.00am featuring all the sort of\nmusic you would expect at a Hallowe'en disco.

    "content": "union6 November1992 Felix 947\nRick Splits\nAfter enthusiastic press coverage,\nfew can be unaware of Imperial\nCollege's possible breakaway from\nthe University of London. In the\nacademic world, many regard it as\nthe only way forward. Departments\nwould no longer have to undergo\nlengthy validation processes\nwhenever course modifications are\nrequired, staff appointments would\nno longer have to go through\nUniversity administration. One\nwonders why Imperial didn't breakaway years ago. Doubtless politics\nare involved!\nAs a representative of the\nstudents, my concern is whether\nthey will suffer as a result of the\nEnts\nsplit. Sabbaticals at the University\nof London Union (ULU) are\nworried about the future of UL U should Imperial, LSE and UCL split from the University. I believe\nthat UL U provide a valuable service\nto our students. Our Union has a very wide range of facilities, but\nthere are some things on offer at\nUL U that we cannot provide.\nI would appreciate some feedback\nfrom Imperial College students. Do\nyou use facilities? Would you feel\ndeprived if they were no longer on\noffer? Write to me in the Union\nOffice, phone me on 3502 or simply\npop in for a chat.\nRick Bilby, ICU DP.\nDom speaks\nThe more observant and regular\nreader may have noticed the lack of\ncolumn inches donated on my part\nrecently and the otherwise general\nabsence of my bit. This is mainly\ndue to the fact that the editor is a fascist and 12.30pm Monday\nlunchtime is outside the realms of\nmy imagination. (Hideous slander!\nI will not stand for it! The deadline\nis l pm Ed)\nBut so on to business. For a run\ndown of events this week, peruse\nthe What's On column. As ever it's all free apart from Friday night\nwhich, for Atmosphere and a bar till\nlam is only a \u00a31 on the door, and\nyou can't say fairer than that.\nThe TVs are now fitted and\nworking in Da Vinci's, showing\nMTV lunchtimes and big sporting\nevents on Satellite as they occur.\nToday is also the first Union\nGeneral Meeting (UGM) at 1pm in\nthe Concert Hall. This is your first\nchance to wave those Union cards\nand ask delicate and sensitive\nquestions. Please try and make it,\nif only out of curiosity and to stop\nsomeone shouting 'Quorum'\n(translation: there's not enough\npeople here, so why bother?).\nIn conclusion, please use your\nUnion facilities to the full. That's what they're there for, and tell your\nfriends!\nThat one and only\nUGM motion-in full\nICU notes:\ni) that the government plans to close\nthe majority of British coal\nproduction\nii) that the Observer newspaper\nestimates that the immediate cost of\nthis will be \u00a38 billion.\nICU believes:\ni) that this is only one part of a disastrous government strategy\nwhich is putting millions on the dole\nii) that miners cannot be left to fight\nalone\niii) that the Tories are weak and\ndivided and can easily be beaten\nICU resolves:\ni) to support the miners in all\npossible ways\nii) to organise a boycott of academic\nand sporting activities on the\nafternoon of Wednesday 21 October\niii) to support the march and lobby\nof parliament on Wednesday\nICU instructs the executive to\npublicise this and future activities\nin support of the miners campaign\nto keep the pits open.\nProposed by Darren Udaiyan\nSeconded by Robin Hirch\nWhat is there to do tonight, you say\nscratching your head and noticing\nthat app et ising piece of Edam over\nin the corner. Well there is\nSunscreem at the Marquee; no too\nexpensive; stay in and watch 'The\nWord', no, too boring; carefully\nplace assorted fireworks into your\nvarious orifices, no, too dangerous\n(Note: Don't try this at home kids);\nor even get the video of all the\nChanging of the Guards at the\nPalace for the last ten years, no,\nsave this for a special occasion.\nSo, the only alternative is the\nUnion, but don't despair there is a good night planned here on Friday\nnight (tonight).\nThe main band is Cygnet Ring.\nThey were described in one of the\nmore popular music weekly s as\n'only band named after a part of a ducks arse can't be all that bad' and,\nfrankly who am I to argue!! Apart\nfrom this the rest of the music press\nincluding Felix (we're not worthy!)\nhave given them rave reviews. So,\nif you are a lover of that sort of\nrocky, rag gly, tag gly, Wonderstuff/Levellers sound then\nI'm sure your destiny lies in the\nLounge on Friday.\nThe very special guests are just\nthat! I won't say too much about\nthem except they are a quite\noutstanding four piece from London\nwith a rosy and promising future,\ntheir name Livingstone (I presume),\ndefinitely an act for music lovers\neverywhere to relish and enjoy.\nThe whole evening will\ncommence at 8pm and apart from\nthe two bands there will be a bar\nextension, some bar promotions and\nof course that ever-so-good (it's Ebeneezer Goode!) disco that will\nbe kick in' it LARGE until\never-so-late.\nTickets are available in advance\nfrom the Union Office, on the first\nfloor of the Union Building, priced\n\u00a32.50. Ents card holders can pick\nthem up for just \u00a31.50 and anyone\nelse can buy some on the door for\n\u00a33.00.

Christopher Riley visits war torn Eastern Turkey and discovers a third player in the Kurdish problem.\nAcross town, near the hospital,\nHakkan is extending his carpet shop\nand enlarging the basement. But\ntwo days ago, work stopped when\nthey came across human bones, a lot of them. The young Kurds\nstopped the excavations\nimmediately to call in someone\nfrom Van museum. A curator\narrived the same day and picked a large skull from the dust and turned\nit in his hands. 'It'sO K, they are\nArmenians,' he concluded. 'Dig.'\nWe now all sit\nround the\ntelevision set. I politely guzzle\ntea, whilst the\nfamily fight over\nthe remote\ncontrol.\nIt is another parched day on the\nshores of the dead salt lake near\nVan in Eastern Turkey. My thirst\nhas not been quenched by the Ayran\nyoghurt drink, and the spicy Eristeli\nsoup hasn't helped either. We now\nall sit round the television set. I politely guzzle tea, whilst the family\nfight over the remote control. The\nAcar family are half Kurdish and\nhalf Turkish; their grandmother was\nArmenian. I ask them how they felt\nabout the Turkish massacre of\nKurdish refugees from Iraq during\nthe Gulf War. 'This is propaganda,'\nthey say. 'Turkey accepted 3,000\nrefugees from Iraq, we are friends\nwith the Kurds.' I say I have seen\npictures and read reports of the\nmassacre. They look at me with\ndist a in. In a bid to start some more\nconversation, I ask what the books\nabove the TV are. They are Turkish\nencyclopaedias, and I ask 17 year\nold El if to translate some of the\nentries. Out of curiosity I choose the.\n'A Bu' volume and open the book\nto Armenia. We go through the text\nand discover that 'Armenians once\nlived in Turkey and some still do.\nIn Turkey they are free but in their\nown country they are not.'\nThe old city of Van, formerly the\ncitadel of the Urartian Empire and\nunquestionably Armenian in the 6th century, today lies as a ruin outside\nthe new city, levelled in 1915\nbefore the Russians invaded. At this\ntime there were still 20 million\nArmenians in Eastern Turkey who\nhad fought along side the Ottoman\nTurks against Russian invasion.\nUnder Russian occupation the\n'Young Turks' quickly grew\nsuspicious of the Armenians and\nexecuted all the armed soldiers.\nCivilians were deported to the\nSyrian deserts and put to death.\nToday there are barely 40,000\nArmenians left in Eastern Turkey.\nI excuse myself when the teapot\nruns out for the second time and\nleave to return to my hotel for an\nappointment with Cihat at eight. We\ngo to a smoky crowded bar across\ntown and sit at the back so that we\ncan see the whole room and the\ndoor. We talk of friends I met on\nmy last visit to Van three years\nbefore. Moussin is now working in\nHakkari as a government lawyer\nand Houdain has joined the PKK,\nthe banded Kurdish Working Party\nwho operate a guerilla warfare\nagainst the Turks in Eastern\nTurkey.\n/ say I have\nseen the pictures\nand read the\nreports of the\nmassacre. They\nlook at me with\ndisdain.\nThe PKK have enjoyed a renewed support in the area this\nyear since an unofficial state of\nemergency was imposed on 21\nMarch, following a new clamp\ndown on Kurds by the Turkish\nauthorities. Cihat describes the\nscene in Van that day when two\nyoung boys were shot dead by\npolice during a peaceful march in\nsupport of the Kurds. 'I tried to\nphone London to tell the world, but\nall the phone lines to Van had been\nstopped,' he complains. 'I think\nover 90 people were killed in other\ntowns that day. Since this time the\nBBC news is always wrong. No-one\nknows what is happening here.'\nCihat says he knows the leader of\nthe PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, and has\nspoken to him recently. I ask what\nexactly the PKK are fighting for.\n'For the Kurdish people,' he\nreplies. This was originally our land\n- there are artefacts to prove it. We\njust want to agree with the\ngovernment to get a federation.'\n'Of course the Armenians also\nhave a claim to this land,' I begin.\n'The new Armenian money depicts\na view of Mount Ararat from\nTurkey.' Cihat smiles for the first\ntime. And isn't Abdullah Ocalan,\nthe PKK leader, an Armenian!' I continue, remembering a rumour I had heard before. His eyes focus on\nme.\n'Yes, Ocalan is originally\nArmenian.' He replies slowly and\nindignantly.\n'How would you divide Eastern\nTurkey?T continue.\n'The people of north Ararat,\naround Kars and in the Kackar\nmountains are more Armenian.\nThose in the south around Van are\nnow Kurds. We would put the\nborder north of Van.'\nFurthest west in Tatvan, Mustaffa,\na Kurdish construction worker is\ninterested to learn that Ocalan is\nArmenian. I ask the same questions\nabout the borders. Armenia extends\nbelow Van and his Kurdistan lies\naround Diyarbakir to the west.\nThe next day I return to my hotel\nin the early hours of the morning.\nPage 12\n\n"

    "content": "Clubs & Societies\n6 November 1992 Felix 947\nIC Boat Club\nMany IC students will be unaware\nthat the 1991/2 season was one of\nthe Boat Club's most successful\never. As has been previously\nreported in Felix, the 1st eight\ndefended its Japanese Henley title\nand all the club enjoyed wins on the\ndomestic circuit. The pinnacle of\nthis success was at Henley Royal\nRegatta, which occurred after the\nend of term in July. It is every\noarsman's ambition to compete and\nsucceed at Henley and this year\nImperial had five crews entered: IC\n1st eight in the prestigious Ladies\nPlate, IC 2nd eight in the Temple\nChallenge Cup for colleges and\nnon-collegiate universities\nworldwide, four 'novice' oarsmen\nin the Visitors Cup for students and\nother members of the top squad in\nthe Thames Cup for Club eights and\nthe Wyfold Cup for fours. These\ntwo latter crews met with stiff\nopposition early on and went out by\nnarrow margins on the Wednesday\nand Thursday respectively, victims\nof the sudden-death nature of the\nevent.\nMeanwhile, the four members of\nthe novice squad were showing\ndetermination and maturity belying\ntheir relatively brief involvement in\nthe sport by reaching the semi-final\nstage at the weekend. All of this\ncrew were members of the Novice\neight, having learnt their rowing at\nIC, who gained the novice pennant\nat the Tideway Eights Head in\nMarch, part of the club's record 4\ntotal wins, unequalled by any\nrowing club previously. The\nTemple Challenge Crew had a tough draw, the Henley stewards\nhaving decided not to seed them.\nThus, they faced three selected\n(seeded) crews in order to reach the\nfinal. They served notice of their\nintention by breaking the record to\nFawley in the first day of racing,\nbeating last year's winners Bristol\nUniversity on the Thursday and the\nhighly favoured Nihon University,\nJapan, on the Friday. The 1st eight\nshowed class in defeating Thames\nTradesmen and completed\nImperial's unprecedented trio of\nsemi-finalists.\nThe four bowed out with honour\non Saturday morning, losing to the\neventual winners Durham\nUniversity but covering a little more\nthan 1 mile 550 yards of the course\nin the process! IC 2nd eight had a strong row managing to conserve\nenergy in defeating Tufts\nUniversity, USA. IC 1st eight also\nmade no mistakes in despatching the\nAustralian National Development\nSquad eight, rowing as Victoria\nRowing Club.\nFinals day dawned dull and\novercast and the first race of the day\nwas Imperial's Temple Challenge\nclash with their old rivals the Irish\nChampions, Trinity College\nDublin, umpired by the regatta\nchairman Peter Coni. As the crews\npaddled up to the start the empty\nstands in the enclosures started to\nfill and nerves were heightened by\nfamiliar faces shouting\nencouragement. This eight was only\nsettled less than two weeks before\nraces began after fiercely\ncompetitive trials and their quickly\ngained self-confidence lay in pieces\nas they found themselves more than\na length down with just over two\nminutes of the race remaining, their\nsupporters listening in horror to the\nimpassive commentary on the\nofficial Tannoy, the crew victims of\nTrinity's relentless pace. But\ncox wain Alice Codrington of St\nMary's Hospital, implored her\nengine room to make the favourites\npay for their early efforts. Her\nwords stung the rowers into greater\naction just before they were\ndrowned out by a wall of sound\nemptying from the now packed\ngrandstands. Imperial dug deep\nwithin themselves and seemed to\nfind another gear mounting a final j breathtaking sprint that brought the\ntwo crews level with only a few\nstrokes remaining. At this point the\nIrish Crew knew they could not win\nand IC went past to cross the line\ninto immortality. The record was\nsmashed by seven seconds and the\neight's jubilation was only matched\nby Trinity's grace in defeat.\nThe 1st eight arrived at the course\nover an hour later to face the\nchallenge of ASR Nereus from\nAmsterdam, containing lightweight\nworld medalists. Finding\nthemselves in a similarly desperate\nsituation at halfway stage, they once\nagain rose to the encouragement of\nthe many Imperial supporters and\nworked their way back from nearly\na length deficit to a few feet as they\napproached the last metres of the\ncourse. Unfortunately in the tension\nand excitement the crew was\nsteered off their all-important line\nand could not gain a lead, though\ncatching the Dutch students with\nevery - stroke and pouring every\nounce of effort into the surge for the\nline. As the crews crossed it the\nscreams and shouts faded to an\nunbearable silence as the finish line\numpires analysed the photo finish.\nAfter what seemed an age the\nanticipation was ended by the result:\n'a dead heat', with a re-row\nscheduled three hours hence, for\nonly the second time in the 153-year\nhistory of the regatta. The Imperial\ncamp, however, was quietly\nconfident that the months of hard\nwinter training would tell and sure\nenough as the crews came into sight\nof the home straight for the second\ntime, the London Students had\ngained the upper hand and\ndominated the race from early on,\nestablishing a powerful rhythm\nwhich held them through a determined final push by Nereus, to\nrecord a staggering second win for\nImperial. Even more noteworthy\nwas the manner of their victory: the\ndead-heat was rowed in a time of\n6 minutes 3 seconds the second-fastest time the course has ever been\ncovered in and faster than the\nwinning time of the Grand\nChampions, University of London,\nrecently heavily featured in the UL press.\nThis represents a remarkable\nachievement and is a tribute to their\ndedication which goes unnoticed by\nmost students at the college. Even\nmore so, the Club's Boatman and\nChief Coach Bill Mason who\nmasterminds all the successes from\nNovice to Henley Champions must\nbe congratulated for his inspiration\nand guidance. The 1st eight and Bill\nwere further honoured by being\nselected to form the basis of the\nGreat Britain under-23's eight\nwhich raced at the Nation's Cup in\nStrathclyde. They unfortunately had\na collision in a heat and were unable\nto realise their full potential in the\nfinal.\nThe club is very grateful to\nSatelcom based in Silwood Park for\ntheir continued sponsorship which\nhelped with the great expense of\nequipping and repairing these crews\nfor competition.\nThis coming season sees almost\nall these oarsmen returning to the\nhard grind of endurance training to\nfurther the club's elite status\ntogether with a large influx of new\nmembers both beginners and\nexperienced internationals. Felix\nwill be carrying news of all the\nevents and charting the progress of\nour crews.\nReport\nIC Boat Club started its 1993 season\nwith some encouraging recent open\nwins. On October 25 at Upper\nThames Small Boat's Head at\nHenley they took the Senior II Quad\nSculls title and the following\nSunday the local Chiswick to\nHammersmith Janousek Fours\nHead brought victory for two\ncox less and two cox ed fours from\n6 IC boats. This boa ds well for this\nterm's main event, the Fours Head\non November 7th at which all these\ncrews and others will be racing. IC\ncoach Bill Mason expects the club\nto continue its impressive record of\nsuccess in this event.\nPage 14\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\n6 November 1992\nLSD the\nDear Jonty,\nI'm glad some people made the\neffort to read up on LSD following\nmy few lines in 'Beit Back' of Felix\n944.\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica,\nwhich I had, by the way, looked up\nbefore they had offers the same\narticle on LSD it offered several\ndecades ago, just as poor and loaded\nwith 'may', 'might', 'could'\nstatements. The lab studies it refers\nto were not carried out on humans,\nand included (say, did they forget\nto mention it in the new editions?)\nlooking into the effects of caffeine,\naspirin and other common drugs on\nmouse genomes. The evidence tends\nto point out that massive and\nsystematically applied doses of\nthese substances do help mouse\ncells to mutate. (Which they do\nunaided about every five minutes\nanyway.)\nFor humans, a major factor in\nsuch mutations is tight jeans, which\nFelix 947\nauthor\nkeep the temperature of gonads\nunnaturally high. Most other\ninfluences are comparatively very\nweak. Since LSD in humans is anti-addictive (an average dose will\nproduce no effect after two or three\ndays of taking it, with return to\nnormal after about a week),\nexcessive use of the substance is\nvirtually impossible.\nAbout the moods and feelings\ninvolved, everything said and its\nopposite is true.\nBy the way, I have no sympathy\nfor a moron who takes acid on his\nown for 'kicks' then beats up some\nvictim when in some nightmare\nsequence of a trip, however awful\nit is. Some shits like that sometimes\nuse the drug as an excuse of what\nthey did. Let me remind you that\nLSD rarely effects people to this\npoint and if it does there must be\nsomeone with them they can't pick\non.\nI am against selling the stuff in\ncoffee shops or pharmacies, but I replies\nbelieve there is no reason not to use\nit under medical supervision (even\nfor 'kicks') in special centres.\nPlease try to read accounts of\nclinical tests such as Stafford and\nGolightly's 'LSD: the problem-solving psychedelic', (but also Tim\nLeary's 'Politics of Ecstasy' to see\na fanatic's sensible argumentation).\nTo know more about trips, read\nAldous Huxley books (trips on\nmescaline) such as 'The Doors of\nPerception' to see how they change\nlives and minds, listen to The Doors\n(the echo here is not by chance),\nPink Floyd, The Beatles ...or maybe\nNirvana.\nI here confirm I have not had a drug-induced 'trip' yet, though\npossibly some other types that a lot\nof religious people claim they know\nthe meaning of (bullshit to me).\nI am conscious of some long-term\nmental effects of LSD, but they are\nnot all that bad as some may wish\nto have others believe. (Quite on the\ncontrary\u2014read about religious\nleaders taking a drug and being\nfollowed up several years\nscientifically in Stafford &\nGolightly's book which also had\ntwo prefaces by high authorities in\nCanadian psychology research).\nINFORMATION is my concern,\nand if my article lacked some\n(voluntarily), I'm glad it initiated a debate in this otherwise very\napathetic college. If you feel\nsatisfied with your mental,\nemotional and spiritual life, if you\ndon't want these new powerful\nexperiences (or are in some way\nafraid)\u2014then DO NOT take LSD, as it can be dangerous for the\nunprepared or reticent.\nBut don't ever try to keep me\nfrom altering my consciousness if\nI do it sensibly and in the way of\na pacifist.\nI appreciate the 'concern'.\nName and address withheld.\nTheft\nDear Jonty,\nThis week started as a good\nweek, quite a rare feeling to have\non a Monday evening. Things were\ngoing well, people were being\nfriendly, work was ticking over and\nthere was a great sunset.\nThen it happened, a good chat in\nDa Vincis, a laugh with friends\nreveling in a good atmosphere, but\nunbeknown to me, my bag (left with\nothers) had gone, in a bar full of,\nso I thought, similar individuals.\nOne of whom thought they liked the\nlook of a grey Jaguar sports bag.\nPerhaps they thought it's bulk\nwould be explained by rolls of fifty\npound notes, or gold ingots. Who\nknows?\nNext day, the realisation that the\nbar staff hadn't picked it up and the\nfeeling of inevitable impending\nhassle. Library books lost, manuals,\nwallet. Not a good day, in fact a s**t day.\nIn a world so riddled with petty\ncrime you might think at Imperial\nwe are above such feelings and\nactions. Not so. Most of the people\nI told were sympathetic, but had\ntheir own story of woe to tell;\n'Yeah, that happened to me once,\nterrible isn't it?'\nTerrible it is, but not the material\nloss, just the intrusion and suspicion\nof fellow human beings. That's the\nworst.\nDavid Williams.\nTummy trouble\nDear Editor,\nI must voice my concern over a recent inclusion on the bottom of\npage 19 (FELIX 946). 'Pounds,\nshillings, pence', as any more\nmature member of society will\nknow, is in fact LSD. As this\nreference was present in the music\npages of Felix, I can only conclude\nthat Poddy the music editor was\nresponsible.\nHis involvement with such 'mind\nbending' drugs would indeed explain his warped perception of reality and those psych a deli c clothes he\ninflicts on the general public.\nFurthermore, I individually cut\n500 of these inscriptions out of page\n19 and on consuming these over the\nweekend T did not find my 'inner-self , but instead had a very poorly\nturn and a very difficult time when\nnature called.\nI demand more editorial responsibility in the future.\nYours Sincerely,\nDominic Wilkinson.\nPS.

Sir Eric Ash,\nImperial's Rector, yesterday\nannounced the setting up a committee to investigate Imperial's future in the federation. The\ncommittee will be established\nwithin the next few days, and no\nindication has been given as to its\npossible membership. The\ncommittee will be asked to examine\nthe possibility of a separation from\nthe University of London.\nThe announcement follows the\nRector's much flagged\nCommemoration Day speech in the\nRoyal Albert Hall on 22 October,\nwhen Sir Eric questioned the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the\nfederal structure. 'Our faith in the\nability of the university to deal\nefficiently and equitably with\ncollege business has been stretched,\nsometimes to near breaking point\nand occasionally beyond', he said.\nSir Eric's speech has caused\nmuch bitter reaction. Professor\nStewart Sutherland, Vice\nChancellor of the University of\nLondon, has criticised the 'fact of\nlife that a dramatic announcement,\nbe it fact or fancy, will always grab\nthe headlines where steady progress\nnever does.' Writing in yesterday's London Student, Professor\nSutherland added that 'there is no\nsuch thing as a conscript amongst\nthe Schools in the University, only\nvolunteers'. He also defended the\nstatus and purpose of the\nUniversity. 'If any School is\nconvinced that federal involvement,\nincluding the right to award a University of London degree, is no\nlonger beneficial then it should\nmake a clear decision either to take\na full part or opt out', wrote\nProfessor Sutherland.\nThe Imperial speech has also\nprovoked some institutions to\nreconsider their own position within\nthe federal structure. Professor\nGraham Zellick, of Queen Mary\nWestfield College, said last week\nthat while Q MW was content to\nremain within the federation, they\nwill 'follow developments\nelsewhere closely so that we can\nreact quickly to any changes'.\nProfessor Zellick also said that\nQ MW was 'a university in\neverything but name'. Q MW was\none of seven larger London\ninstitutions which last year joined\nImperial in financial independence\nfrom the University of London,\nProfessor David Roberts, Provost\nof University College London\n(UCL), said that it was not certain\nthat Imperial would leave the\nfederation. 'Eric Ash isn't divorcing from the University, he\nis merely exploring what needs to\nbe done', he said. Professor Roberts\nsaid that there are two ways of the\nUniversity of London dealing with\nan Imperial defection. Either UCL and other colleges would leave\nalong with Imperial, or the\nUniversity of London could amend\nits structure to encourage colleges\nto remain in the federation. The\nCouncil of King's College has yet\nto discuss the matter, but in a statement, they said there were still\nmajor benefits in remaining in the\nfederation.\nHuge price rises have been\nproposed for the Imperial College\nSports Centre when it re-opens next\nJanuary.\nThe centre is to introduce an 'on'\nand 'off peak system, whereby\nprices rise and fall depending on the\ntime of day, and the day of the\nweek. The facilities of the gym,\nswimming pool and new sauna and\nHealth Suite are to be charged\nseparately\". Additional price\nchanges mean that a three month or\nterm pass to the sports centre will\ncost up to \u00a316. This compares to a cost of \u00a325 for the whole of the last\naca uci iii c year.\nCaroline Osner, the Imperial\nCollege Sports and Leisure\nManager refused to comment on the\nproposed price rises, but said any\nchanges would take place on the\nprinciple of separating the charges\nfor facilities. She said this would\nmean that people using the gym\nwould not be charged for use of\nswimming\nMs Osner continued that any\nchanges in prices would first have\nto be passed by South Kensington\nFacilities User Advisory Group,\nwhich will meet on Wednesday 11th November.\nWarning\nby staff reporters\nStudents are warned that due to a Remembrance Day ceremony in the\nAlbert Hall, they many face\nproblems with security this\nweekend. Any bicycles left chained\nup on Prince Consort Road will be\nremoved by police, and 'disruptive'\nstudents entering or leaving the\nUnion in the evening may be\narrested. Deputy President Rick\nBilby warned students 'not to make\ntoo much noise leaving the union or\nthey might get nicked'.

The group, Espiritu, the\nlabel, Heavenly, believe in magic,\nthe sound, a Spanish sort of groove.\nConsidering their parentage,\nslightly disappointing, but to be\ncompared to Frazier Chorus is a trifle unfair. They were gods, and\nthis is just another extraordinary\nHeavenly release.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Out now on Heavenly/Columbia.\nit is more like a new song\ninfluenced by Hendrix with sample\nsounds from the man himself. I just\ndidn't feel right, an OK B side\nmaybe. The other song on the EP\nis far more interesting, still\nHendrixy (and again some sampled\nstuff) but not reheated stuff. Again\nit didn't blow my mind (but then,\nit's quite hard to blow) but it had\nmore potential. I still want to WAIT\nand see (that's listen)...\nMoo Co. Ltd.\nThe Poor Boys \u2014Pardon Me\nPardon me indeed, Mr Poorboy.\nFor those who don't read reviews\nin their en tir it y here's a summary:\nLA. Rock. Enough said? Well for\nthose still reading, the initial\noff putter on this album is the clich e mandatory moody photo pose on\nthe back cover. Wota bunch of\nto s spots, they look most suspect and\nnon-triumphant. Indeed the picture\nof the pig on the front cover is\ninteresting though...One final gripe\nabout the packaging is the ego trip\nphoto collage in the little CD booklet, so hypocritical. At one\nextreme they're portrayed as gentle\ncaring Move my baby' men, at the\nother extreme they are real men\nwho drink non-stop and have\ncopious amounts of rock chicks.\nYUK! But I hear you cry what\nabout the music! True, the\npackaging shouldn't affect my view\nof the music but it doesn't help a lot.\nWell, we start with 'Hey Man',\nthe first song on the album\n(naturally enough). Although it is\nsimilar to material made by every\nband (almost every band then) in\nLA, it is quite good. The biggest\nvirtues are the reasonably fast,\npunchy tempo coupled with the\nlength being short enough to\nprevent it becoming boring. Good\nstuff for a single perhaps. 'Can't get\nyou back' carries on from 'Hey\nMan' and in many respects for all\npurposes might as well be titled\n'Hey Man'. 'Guilty' is the standard\nrock ballad everyone expects from\nLA groups after success from bands\nsuch us Poison, Cinderella, Faster\nPussycat and countless other minor\nacts. It is the usual 'sit around' with\nacoustic guitars routine that bores\nme eternally.\n'Love and Faith' is INXS and\nPoison rolled into one. 'Shine' is\nnot worth a mention, so I won't. 'No Real Emotion' is unnerving\nbecause the name of this song\nreflects on the content of this album.\nIt's all so false with the typical 'I love you baby' and 'If you go I 'll\nwither and die painfully' type\nlyrics.\n'Brand New Amerika' is atypical\nof the album. For the first and only\ntime on this recording you can hear\na bass guitar not following a drum\nor guitar line but actually\nparticipating creatively. Alas the\nillusion is shattered with 'Make\nYour Move'.\nThis leaves me to mention the last\nsong 'Don't Need You Around'\nwhich is prophetic because we don't want you around, Poorboys. There\nare other songs on the album but\nbecause they all sound the same I'm not going to mention any OK. Kev Floyd.\n\u2022 Released on Hollywood,\nNovember 9th.

    "content": "Felix 947\nReviews\n6 November 1992\nInvasion Werewolf\nEver wondered why cult-movie fans\nseem to like old (1950s) horror\nmovies so much? After all, they\nwere usually under budgeted, shot\nwithout a script, using special\neffects primitive by today's standards...What's so impressive\nabout a big piece of coloured\nrubber-foam terror ising your local\nneighbourhood? How can anyone\nbe interested in characters which are\nso stereotyped you forget in which\nmovie your saw them (the mad\nscientist, the cafe waitress, the\nreporter, the federal agent)?\nWell, if you want to find out,\nInvasion Werewolf is just the play\nto see. It's written and played by\nJohnny Myers who is himself a50s horror fan, and it does a pretty good\njob of explaining the appeal of these\nmovies. The idea is to take you into\nthe office of a 'Cheapo Production'\nmanager, and enter his imagination\nas he reads the script for a prospective horror picture. The\nmore he reads, the more the\naudience is able to see the movie\nforming in his mind.\nThe movie ('Invasion Werewolf)\nis written and performed so well\nthat the audience starts seeing in\nblack and white, hearing glitches in\nthe soundtrack, and generally\nforgetting they are in a theatre.\nJohnny Myers is capable of\nchanging characters so convincingly\nand quickly that the acting seems\nalmost simultaneous (his miming\ncapabilities are also quite\nimpressive...). The illusion of a movie is further enhanced by a clever use of lighting which helps\nstreamline the changing of scenes,\nand the music and sound effects for\nthe play are also quite good.\nYou may not come out of this\nplay a cult-fan, but you will have\n'seen' a good movie, and you will\nprobably come to appreciate the\nunderlying humour of this genre.\nM.A. \u2022 Old Red Lion, St Johns St\nIslington, EC1.

Da Vinci's early sketches\nlead onto the work of the early\nexperimenter's Cayley, Henson and\nStringfellow, before the start of\npowered and unpowered flight at\nthe start of the twentieth century.\nThe rest of the exhibits are divided\ninto four sections. The historical\nnarrative of the development of air\ntransport continues through the use\nof archive footage and static\ndisplays.\nThe development of the aero\nengines is traced from the first\npiston powered engines to the first\ngas turbine engine designed by\nFrank Whittle. The evolution of the\ngas turbine continues through to the\nlarge turbofan s used on today's airliners and the engine used in the\nHarrier jump jet.\nThe remaining area of the gallery\nis used to display the Science\nMuseum's extensive collection of\naircraft and memorabilia. Hanging\nfrom the roof are a Spitfire,\nHurricane, the first aircraft to cross\nthe Atlantic - a Victor Vimy, the\nprototype Harrier Jump Jet, the\ncross-section from a747 Jumbo Jet\nand many others. Housed in show\ncases are a range of flying suits,\nwind tunnel models and flight\ninstruments and other exhibits.\nTo make the past more colourful\nand vivid, characters from the\nhistory of flight are played by actors\nwho roam the gallery, bringing the\npast to life.\nIn order to make aeronautics easier\nto understand, there is a flight lab\noutside the gallery. Although\nnominally for the children, it\ndemonstrates all the principles of\nflight through easy to understand\nmodels and simple experiments.\nSteve Newhouse.\n\u2022 The Science Museum is free to\nstudents and staff of Imperial\nCollege on production of your\nUnion card or Swipe Card.\nWozzeck\nOpera\nWozzeck\nAs theatre, ENO's Wozzeck is an\nengrossing and moving experience,\nand those who think they may not\nrespond to Berg's overwhelmingly\npowerful, although in it it ally difficult, music, need not be\ndeterred.\nDavid Pountney's production\nbrilliantly combines the grim and\nthe lurid; corrugated metal shutters\nrise and fall on ther bleak barrack-room world in which Wozzeck's three garish, grotesque tormentors,\nthe nagging Captain, the sinister\nDoctor and the brutal Drum-Major,\nberate and bully him. Wozzeck\nhimself needs to be much more than\nan anonymous victim; in a society\nwhich regards him as little more\nthan a robot, it is his imagination\nand sensitivity which destroy him.\nDonald Maxwell's is an ideal\nperformance, bringing not only\nthese characteristics but also\naccurate, rich-toned singing to the\ncentral role. He is complemented by\nKristine Ciesinski, whose bright,\nstrong voice is well-suited to the\npart of Marie, his unfaithful lover.\nThe triumphant concert\nperformance of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron which opened this\nyear's Edinburgh Festival firmly\nestablished conductor Richard\nArmstrong's credentials as an\ninterpreter of the Second Viennese\nSchool, and he devotes similar care\nand insight to Berg's complex and\nrichly rewarding score.

    "content": "Editorial\nWhen I first came to Imperial, I swore that I would not become a sad\nhack. Having become a Felix hack,\nsad or otherwise, I still hold one\ngroup of people in utter contempt.\nIf I try and imagine explaining\ntheir activities to a stranger to the\nCollege it would go something like\nthis; This is group of people who\ngo around trying to steal large\nlumps of metal from other people\nwhile at the same time trying to\nprotect their own lump of metal. It\nis called mascot ry. What is so distressing about this\nseemingly trivial activity is the\ncharacteristics it brings out in those\ninvolved. The activities of the\nmascot e er take over the life of the\npoor individual. He cannot talk\nabout anything else, he develops\nstrange antagonisms to people he\nhas never met before. And he will\nrisk life and limb to save his\nprecious mascot from harm.\nAlarmingly, a more sinister side\ncan emerge, Rambo-esque\ntendencies evolve and outbreaks of\nviolence to protect the worthless tin\ncan occur. Last year a student of\nImperial had his leg crushed by a car in just such an incident. It is\ncommon knowledge that frequent\ndamage occurs to doors, walls, cars\nand even people during mascot ry events.\nIt is not as if the College crawls\nwith mascot e ers, but still it rules the\nconversation of every member of\nthe CC Us. Broadsheet and\nGuildsheet, the RCS and City and\nGuilds' rags, lovingly devote pages\nto this inane sport. Never has so\nmuch been done by so few to so\nlittle effect.\nBut what is the motivation? They\nraise money for charity, is the\nimmediate reply. What other events\ncould be used to help out good\ncauses, let us try kidnapping the\nFelix 947\nQueen Mother, and ransom her\nback for UNICEF, See how many\nsponsored murders we can commit\nin a week, all for a good cause!\nSurely there are better and more\nresponsible ways of raising money.\nMy advice to those four fresher s who stole the King's Mascot is get\nout while you can. Mascotry is not\nworth the contempt the rest of the\nCollege will heap on you if you\ncontinue down this twisted path.\nSecurity\nDue to a bad choice of words in last\nweek's Felix I appear to have\noffended many members of\nImperial College's excellent\nSecurity Staff. I fully agree that\nSecurity dealt with the incident in\nthe story in a correct and sensitive\nmanner. I am reluctant to offend\nmembers of College Staff who work\nhard enough as it is, without being\nattacked by students.

May we assure\nyou that that is certainly not the\ncase. The Security Department's only concern has been to establish\nthe facts of what has obviously been\nstories? It certainly is doing very\nwell so far; no need to think up new\nsoap-opera scenarios, just follow\none or the other of the princesses.\nVirtuous noble blood sets standards\nfor people of the Empire.

    "content": "Felix 947\n'eat ure6 November 1992\nFree in the Air\nRafal Lukawiecki takes his first flight...\nI always wanted to feel free! It must\nsound like ac liche, but watching\nbirds have made me realise that\nthere are many things I and many\nother people will never be able to\nachieve, however hard you try.\nWhile some of them are really\nimpossible, others turn out to be\nexhilarating experiences if one has\na chance to try them out. Gliding\nhappened to be the latter one for\nme.\nWhile wandering among stalls at\nthis year's Freshers' Fair and\npretending to be one year younger,\nI saw an elegant glider surrounded\nby a bunch of enthusiastic looking\npeople (one of them was wearing a parachute and kept on telling\neverybody that he was a Pilot). My\ninstinct told me that it was a thing\nI should consider trying. Two days\nlater I signed myself for a trial flight\nwith Imperial College Gliding Club.\nAs I live in Balham, I had to wake\nup at 5am on Sunday 11 October to\nbe at 7am in Southside (yes, the\nbiggest capital in the world has a most remarkable public transport\nsystem). It was unearthly cold when\nI met some other half-asleep people\nled by Sarah, who seemed to keep\nherself warm by talking about\nvirtually everything, occasionally\nstopping to take a deep breath. After\nabout 40 minutes of unsuccessful\n; \" : ; ;\nwaiting for the other 'leaders' and\ntheir cars, half of us (including\nlucky me who picked the winning\nmatch) left to Lasham, which is\nabout 1 hour away from London.\nAlthough we had no chance to fly\non that day because the always\npredictable sort of well-known\nEnglish weather made us stay\nindoors, I knew I had swallowed the\nhook together with the fisherman\nand I was about to become a compulsive gliding addict in no time\nat all.\nI turned up in Lasham on my own\non a sunny Tuesday afternoon and\njoined the queue for the 'Air\nExperience' trial flight.\nNevertheless, it was not till my\nother flight on this day, that I reached the climax of feeling\nfreedom in the air; which was one\nof the most beautiful and mind-blowing experiences in my life. I was lucky to have been given a training flight by Paul Minton,\nretired former president of the IC\nGliding Club\u2014-I learnt about that\nonly a few days later! His attitude\ntowards flying and teaching others\nto fly was one of an overenthusiastic small boy who knows\nthat he is doing something he likes\nan awful lot. That enthusiasm was\ncontagious. Having been launched\nby wire winch, we climbed to the\naltitude of nearly 2000 feet above i the ground in a matter of about 15\nseconds! That was quite dramatic\n(but extremely exciting from the\npoint of view of a rollercoaster fan)\nintroduction to something very calm\nand different: flying without any\nartificial help of an engine. Paul\nshowed me the basic movements of\ncontrols and their effects on the\naircraft (to which he always\nreferred to as 'she') and asked me\nto try them out myself. While\nsmoothly and quietly gliding\nthrough the air I begun to learn to\nenjoy being free in all three\n\u2014 mam\ndimensions. From the very first\nmoment I touched the 'stick' and\nsaw the earth run away from my\neyes and then appear on another\nside of the glider, I started to realise\nthat this was another milestone,\nanother normally inaccessible limit\n. which I now had at my feet.\nThe flight did not last too long,\nbut it made me grin and feel happy\nall through the evening (someone\neven asked me what I was on).\nUndoubtedly, gliding is a drug and\na very addictive one, too. It makes\nyou think about harmony in which\none has to be with the nature if they\nwant to survive. It is one of those\nrare moments when almost\neverything including your life is\nonly up to you and the nature. It is\na way to see the stunning beauty of\nfreedom in all dimensions apart\nfrom time.\nYou probably know that\npractically anybody can fly gliders,\nespecially now, while at College. It\nwould not cost you much, as all\nflying is sub sidi sed by the Union.\nAn experience that you may have\nbeen unsuccessfully looking for on\nevery weekend's night, will not cost\nyou more than what you spend on\ndrinks, etc when you go out. And\nit may turn out to be much more!\nGliding is also the first step in\nobtaining an official Pilot's licence,\nbut this is another story.\nImperial College Gliding Club is\nthe largest gliding organisation of\nsuch sort in Britain. You are\nwelcome to come to any of its\nweekly meetings on Thursdays at\nl pm in room 266 in the Aeronautics\nbuilding. Trial 'no-obligation'\nflights are run during the first term.\nPage 7\n\n"
