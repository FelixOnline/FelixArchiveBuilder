He went down extremely well and warmed\neveryone up with the odd 'chorus'.\nSqueeze were a different kettle of fish. Unlike Alan White\nthey didn't have to ad-lib to chants & in-jokes of eels and\nalsatian s. They're a down to earth band \u2014 not so much as the\nFeelgoods \u2014 who could justifiably fit into the respectable\nend of the punk rock section. Basic& unpretentious, they had\nmany people dancing before the end of their set.\nBy the time Sassafras came along I was really into the\nparty mood, courtesy of the disco and the general crowd at this\nextra ve ganza. More sophisticated and talented than their predecessors,\nSassafras proved worthy bi 11-toppers. I'd seen them down at\nReading in the summer, when I thought they were just brash and\nabra is ive enough to Hearten a festival audience.\nLast Friday they were somewhat tamer. There was more\nattention to the fine gris sly detail, and I could hear the vocals for once. Their repertoire was a mixed bag of intellectual rock\nand hard hit tin' trucking music. A lot of it came from the band's latest vinyl effort 'Riding High' on Chrysalis. As the night progressed Sassafras boogied a lot more,\ntaking with them a now gullible crowd. They finished up with\na couple of Beatles numbers - a pity since their own material\nis quite original.\nApart from the films, the beer, the disco etc, that was\nCarnival. It came over rather well and there was certainly a fair whack of good organisation behind it. Ta very much Guilds. Clive Dewey\nLABELTHANKSJOYOU\n\n"

But I find this paper a suitable mouthpiece\nto express some opinions, which I think need immediate\nattention.\nEvery year, when the\nCollege re-opens in October,\nwe witness many functions,\nexhibitions, etc New students\nbecome aware of various\nsocieties existing in this\ncollege The organisers of the\nmany societies show much\ninterest in enrolling new\nmembers; but how many of\nthem take the care of letting\ntheir new friends know about\nthe societies' forthcoming\nevents, so that the latter may\nparticipate?\nOf course, one can see\nposters hung up here and\nthere; but these are few and\nfar between* Is it not possible to send individual invitations\nto every member in his\ndepartment; after all it costs\nnothing? The Indian Society\nis one, which doesn't care to\nnotify its new members of\ntheir activities. Such organisations should cease to exist. My second request is for a common room for all Post Graduate students where they\ncan watch the TV or read\nnewspapers^ both from home\nand abroad, while having their\nlunch or enjoying drinks. Of\ncourse, the Haldane Library keeps newspapers, but then\nwe can't eat food there. I wish the respective authorities\nwould be kind enough to\nconsider this.\nFinally, I would like to\nmention something about the\nexorbitant tuition fees to be\nimposed upon the overseas\nstudents from next year. Will\nnot it affect the international\nnature of this world famous\nCollege? We all know that one-third of the students are from\noverseas. I hope IC Union will not remain a passive spectator.\nYours sincerely, Mr RAMEN DRAG UH A, Post Grad\nAtmospheric Physics Censorship\ndegenerate films\nneeded for\nDear Sir, - On Sunday the 21st of November whilst attending\nthe \" SCAB Evening\" a suitable name for what wa\u00ab to\nensue \u2014 it was my misfortune\nto witness the most revolting\ndisplay of perverse, not to\nmention warped, sexual\nactivities it has ever been\nmy misfortune to cross paths\nwith.

Commonsense\non the part of the organisers,\ncoupled with a modest amount\nof responsibility and a modicum\nof good taste, would have\nmade censorship obsolete.\nNone of these qualities was\nevident, so I consider it a necessary and prudent step to\nrid the College of any future\nthreat of obscene showings.\nThis aim should be strived for\nwith a fabian zest! I am aware that the def in it ion\nof obscene varies greatly from\nperson to person, but under no\ncircumstances would I concede\nthat SCAB'S blue movies\nserved a useful purpose to this\ncollege, except to corrupt the\nminds of the supposedly\nintelligent students here. I view beast i ali ty and masturbating \u2014 these were explicitly shown \u2014 with the utmost\ncontempt.\nI conclude by stating that\nin retrospect I feel hard done\nby at paying 25p to be present\nat such a degenerate debacle. The money may be going to a good cause but a means to an end doesn't transform\ninto right.\nS PUP Physics2 Prophetic Felix?\nSir, - Is FELIX prophetic, or\nam I confusing cause and effect? I am referring to the\napparently controversial College issues you keep\nraising; for example the latest\none being the rejections of the\nLinsteatt extension plans. Unless we can mobil is e our friends, the student body\nand other members of IC, it\nseems pointless to protest\nat \u2022 the plan's rejection. All Students with whom I have\ninstigated a discussion' on\nthis topic either believe' it to\nbe no concern of theirs or\nfeel. that they are powerless\nto do anything.\nthe same we must remember\nthat the benefits of new halls will be future students, able to work in reasonable\naccommodation, at a fair rent,\nclose to College.

Well, it\nmeets about ten(?) times each year to\nto consider reports and recommendations\nfrom the sub-committees and criticise their actions if necessary. At Council Welfare, Academic affairs, External affairs and Publications are\nprobably the four main areas outside\nthe Exec reports. Under the first two headings are a multitude of sins, such as Health, Safety, Accommondation, th f Alternative Prospectus, Representation\non College Committees, and new courses\nor changes in syllabuses. Council also elects rep rent at ives to\nsit on the many College Committees\non which it has been allowed represent-ation. The co-ordination of these reps is then the business of the President. Improvement of their reporting procedures\nand accountability is a matter which Council has recently been discussing. Comparison with other colleges\nLooking at the Unions of other\ncolleges, we find a number of differences.\nMany arise from our C CU structure, which is almost the same as the J CR system at Reading, York or Lancaster, although\nthe physical delineation of the Constituent Colleges has almost disappeared\n(look at New Huxley). Our Exec committee\nis much smaller than at most other\nUniversities and has less power.\nWe have fewer sabbatical Union officers per capital than other Unions, and so matters are still delegated by Council to a Plethora of sub-committees,\nand effectively to their chairmen.\nOne consequence is that fewer\nofficers are elected by campus-wide\nballot (4) than at most other large Unions.\nAnother is that the representatives on one College committee are often in ignorance of events at other committees\nuntil the.next Council meeting. Perhaps\nmore power in fewer hands fs the answer\n\u2014 it would also make greater competition\nfor posts, most of which are unopposed,\nand so produce a more representative\nCouncil. There are three areas which, in many\nlarge Unions, are represented on the\nCouncil and often directly on the\nExecutive; these are Entertainments,\nPublications, and Transport. A tIC, probably for historical reasons, the Ents Committee has been treated as a society and has little ' political' weight.\nPublications is an area that the\nUnion is just beginning to notice, and through Publications Board the media\nare coming close into the Union structure.\nTransport is a thorn in the Union's side, since it has never been organised\ncentrally in the Union, alway being left\nto one of the major subcommittees (or\ntwo of you include coach hire). There are many problems in this area \u2014 ask any\nmember of Council or of rf teA CC andR CC general committees!\nI hope that this article has given some of my readers (hello \u2014 has anyone\nreached the end of the article?) (thank\nthe good chap above - yes Ty piss st), an insight into the Union which runs\nthe societies to which they belong, and which publishes this newspaper.\nI now hope you' ll put your pens to paper and make a few criticisms of the\nUnion either direct to the Permanent\nWorking Party, or through the letters\ncolumn of FELIX.( May they please be,\nshort, sweet and legible - Typist). Eds note:- Owing to space considerations\nFelix is unable to reproduce the diagram\nenclosed with this article. Nevertheless\nthe article renders the diagram almost\nsuperfluous.\nNights at\nWaterloo\nMiss Pat Simmons retired last Friday, having answered 430 million 'phone calls in the last thirteen years. At the Young\nVic in The Cut, near Waterloo Station, a double bill of plays by Tom Stoppard\nhas opened.\nThe connection between those two\nsentences is the play // You're Glad,\nI 'll be Frank, which opens the Young Vic evening. Based on a clever idea, whose force is spent in the opening\nminute, and a contemplation of the\nnature of time, the play has, as its\ncentral character, the girl who tells you the time if you dial TIM( or rather 123\nin these days of technological success). Natash Pyne plays Gladys, presiding\nover the multiple set from her perspex\nbooth, musing about the differences\nbetween time measured in seconds and minutes and TIME measured in ages and\naeons. Roy Hudd appears as her husband\nFrank, a bus driver, chasing up the\nechelons of the Post Office to the First T SHIRTS\nnow available\nfrom the\nFelix office\nONLY \u00a31.50\nLord, who reveals the secret of TIM to him.\nOriginally a radio play, Glad/Frank\nserves as a curtain-raise r to the main\nboat of the evening \u2014 The Real Inspector\nHound, a glorious send up of those\npretentious critics who endlessly compare performances ( \" The finest\ncynthia since the war\"). Mr Hudd appears again as the critic Birdboot, ever lasting after the leading\nlady, whilst his companion Moon (Geof-frey Hutchings) dreams of becoming the first string critic of his paper. The play\nthey have come to see is a splendidly\nham performance of a thriller in the\n\"Who killed thing; noone will leave the\nhouse\" vein. Mysteriously the critics are drawn into the performance in a way\nwhich it would be churlish of me to\nreveal. Suffice it to say that the double\nbill is delightfully presented and well worth a visit. Meanwhile back at the ranch-house,\nor rather the Lyttelton auditorium at the\nNational Theatre, Thomas Bernhard's The Force of Habit is playing in two\nacts. The first compares favourably with\nBeckett' s Waiting for Godot in the\nboredom stakes, although things begin to\nbrighten up in the second, by which\ntime the auditorium looked considerably\nSatre tr ad ged y Eric Stovell previews the forthcoming\nDramsoc production ' The Flies' On four nights next week (Wednesday\nDecember 8th to Saturday December 11th at 7.30pm in the Union Concert Hall) Imperial College Dramatic society are\npresenting Jean-Paul Sartre's 'The\nFlies'.\nThe plot is loosely based on the\nGreek tragedy of Oresters, who returns\nhome after an absence of fifteen years with high ideals of avenging his father's murder. But the host i le reception he gets\nfrom the diffident towns fo jk and, indeed,\nfrom his sister Electra, change his mind.\nemptier. The play is set in the decrepit\ncaravan home of a circus Ring-master.\nOutside the caravan the characters are Juggler, Tight-rope dancer, Clown and\nLion tamer, but inside, with the Ring master, they are to perform the Trout\nQuintet of Schubert; or rather rehearse\nit, since the Ring master's only hope\nis to keep his troupe together long\nenough for them to become proficient\nmusicians. What improves the second act is that\nthe instruments are out and the actors\nshow themselves to be not at all bad musicians. Oliver Cotton's Clown dolefully draws the Trout theme out on\nhis bass, whilst Warren Clarke' s Lion tamer goes through agonies on the\npiano, his hands bandaged after a mauling from a lion. Imperturbably in\nthe middle is the Ring master, Philip Locke, full of legends of his hero Pablo Casals, reminding his players that all will be better \" in Augsburg tomorrow\".\nThe ingenious setting, designed by\nTimothy O 'Brien and Taze ena Firth contains, besides the open-sided\ncaravan, a large lorry and an enormous\nnumber of empty beer-cans, which are kicked about mercilessly by the departing\nactors.\nThomas Stevenson\nflies back to IC\nThis story was of particular interest\nto Sartre because he wrote it during the early days of the last war when France had been overrun by Hitler' s troops,\nbut had not yet formed an underground\nresistance.\nSatre's version of the story reveals\nsome of the ideas to be found in his other plays and books, particularly in Orestes struggle for freedom from the influence and control of the god Zeus.

The medics arrived at\nHarlington with a well earned\nreputation of being one of the\nmore robust and effective\ncollege sides in London. So\nit was with some apprehension\nbut a large measure of resolve\nthat our lads went out onto\nthe field. IC \u2014 notoriously slow\nstarters \u2014 weathered the early\nstorm where London exploited\ntheir aerial superiority with a series of high curling crosses into the \u2022 box. But for the\nbravery of Brabbin and the\neffective love of Huntingdon\nIC may well not have survived\nthis early onslaught.\nSurvive it they did however,\nand slowly gathering composure,\nbegan with some deft interchanges to set up their own attacks. A brief skirmish on the edge of the London area\ninvolving Bates and Baker saw the older man, with typical nonchalance, slot the ball in\nthe net. An unexpected windfall for a hitherto bewildered\nIC side. The second half saw the\ngame develop into a fast\nexciting struggle for dominance,\nwith IC growing in stature with\nevery minute. In midfield the\nblond, elegant captain of IC, Grimwade, contended the\nrights with all the verve and mastery of an accomplished star. Add to this the dogged\ndetermination of his midfield\nsupport and the persistence\nof Lind on and Frampton up\nfront and it is not difficult to\nsee why IC \u2014 in terms of team\nwork at least \u2014 emerged\nslightly the better side. In terms of goals however,\nLondon Hospital came off\nwinners in the 2nd half with\nan inevitable header. A lapse on the part of the IC defense was punished severely\nalmost clinically, with a remarkable example of how to\nhead the ball. And so the\ngame ended in a stalemate.\nThe game proved to be an interesting forerunner for the\nforthcoming cup clash between\nthe two clubs on Saturday,\nIC at least can draw some\nsmall comfort from the\nencounter. The forte of their\nopponents lies, so to speak,\nin the air. If ICc an stifle\nthis undoubted talent then\nthey will be half way to\nregaining the coveted trophy\nwhich, incidentally, was last\nin our possession during the\nhalcyon days of Smith & Co, in '72 - ' 73.\nTeam:- K Allen, C Howley, I Huntingdon, D Brabbin, R Young, T Grimwade, S Bates,\nA Baker, L Lindon, P Frampton,\nS Gee.\nGliding\nFlying start\nThe Gliding Club has had a very successful term so far, with about 2 0 new members\nprogressing with their training,\nsome of them nearing solo standard. For these people we\nwill be organising a course during the Christmas vacation, which weather permitting,\nwill produce the first crop of\nsolo pilots for this session. A group of ex-student members of the club have just been\non a very successful trip to\nScotland, one of them climbing\nto over 20,000 feet in lee waves off the Scottish\nmountains.\nWe have at last taken\ndelivery of our new high\nperformance glass-fibre glider\nand work is progressing\nrapidly to get it flying as soon\nas possible.

On the\noffensive they produced some\ngood moves and were unlucky\nnot to score off some of them.\nLate in the first half IC did manage to take the lead when\ncaptain Bob Middleton knocked\na cross from emeritus captain\nDave Balderson into the back\nof the net.\nUntil half-way through the\nsecond-half IC looked like\nincreasing their lead. The ntr ad ged y struck when IC sweeper Malcum Call un was\ninjured and had to leave the\nfield. The ensuing confusion in\nthe defence allowed the Bank\nto score twice. IC sorted\nthemselves out and produced\na hard fight back in the\nattempt to equalise. The energy the team put in during\nthis period was rewarded when\nDave Balderson scored after\nan excellent move down the\nright wing. This provided a fitting end to a hard fought,\neven and enjoyable match.\nTeam:-/? Hutson, M Callun, R Vaz, J Huckle, C Smith, C Parker, A McRobie, T Sethi.\nR Middleton, D Balderson,\nUmpire A Creek.\nJOHN HUCK LEI C were not looking forward\nto this game as, they had\narrived with a team which was two men short and were left\nwith a daunting task. There was little time for reflection\nand soon everyone had their\nwork cut out ( especially the\nsix-man pack who began to\nshow superior skill and\nmanaged to contain the\nCornish pack.)\nIC held back the Cornish attacks with some great\ncovering and started to look\ndangerous themselves when\nthe backs received possession. Al \u2014 though the IC pack won a fair share of ball from line outs and loose-ruc ks, it\nneeded all the team's energy\nand determination to defend\nwell against the continuous\nCornish pressure, which\nmainly came from set scrum s where their two man advantage\nwas most telling. Eventually the Cornish scored from a penalty kick, given for an infringement in aru ck. Showing great resilience, IC went straight back at\nCornish who proceeded to gave away a penalty, which was duly put over by Pat Dun lea vy to make it 3\u20143 at half-time.\nAlthough IC were beginning\nto feel the pace they nevertheless took play into Cornish' s half for long periods in the\nsecond-half. After a little\ndifference of opinion with an\nIC player one of Cornish' s forwards was sent .off. This gave IC added impetus and after staying in Cornish' s25 \u2014line for a long spell they\nwere rewarded with a try by\nRonnie Howard, who crashed\nthrough a crowd of defenders\nto put the ball over the line. Pat Dunleavy converted to\nmake it 9 - 3 for IC. Cornish came back in a last effort to salvage something but it was too late and they still could not penetrate\nIC's defence. The score\nremained 9\u20143 at full-time.\nThis was a really fine\nperformance by the whole\nteam but particularly the\nforwards who played as though there was no tomorrow\nand provided the backs with a chance to run with the ball. They ' often threatened to\nbreak through and were\nunlucky not to score a couple\nmore times.\nTeam:- Jenner, Rust, Mi 11,\nGibson, Pettit, Dunleavy,\nHoward, Oyler, Fishburn,\nDowning, Foley, Wiltshire,\nScott.\nMIKE GIBSON( Captain)\nNIGHTLINE 581-2468\nINTERNAL 2468\n6pm9 am Every Day\nSomeone to talk to...\n...and information\nTenpin Bowling\nIC take off\nin airport\ncompetition\nThe College' A' Team came\nthird in the 2nd round of the\nAirport Bowl's Inter-League\nTournament last Saturday.

The Rector said that this cut would probably\nmaterialise as6%, and that\nthis could be expected to last until 1980.\nAlthough the exact value\nof IC's grant from the UGC was unclear, the Rector\nreiterated the need for\neconomies; new ventures will will only be started at the\nexpense of old.

Prof Scorer \u2014 dressed in a red, blue and green kilt,\nmatching tie, sporran etc (but\nNO dirk!) \u2014 included a survey of the Earth's history\nand showed how vital the\npresence of life is to the\ncomposition of the atmosphere.\nHe then looked at Homo\nSapiens himself, and tried to\njustify his label of ' Clever Morons' by pointing out that,\nalthough science and technology are all very well, Society engages in only short\nterm views of the world.\nHence the population,\nmineral resource and energy\ncrises. Indeed, by comparison\nwith locusts, he suggests\nthat the Earth is suffering\nfrom a plague of humanity.

    "content": "FELIX, DECEMBER3 rd19765 The Whys.Buts &Ifsof WELFARE Xmas Social Security\nTheir has been a certain\namount of confusion over the\npresent situation regarding\nvacation benefits. When the\nnew grant came into effect in\nSeptember '76, the composition\nof the grant was changed,\nincreasing the vacation al element, which is only payable\nduring the Christmas and\nEaster vacation, to \u00a311.35,\nthis amount being deducted\nfrom any supplementary\nBenefit claim made.\nHow to Claim:\nClaims can only be made\nwhen you are available for\nwork, so you must try and find\nwork; go first to your local\nJob Centre where they will try\nand provide you with employ-ment. It will be considered\nunreasonable if you turn down\ngeneral employment, but you\nwouldn't be expected to undertake heavy ph s ical work or\nun social hours.\nIf you fail to get a job\nafter having made an effort,\nyou should ask the clerk at\nthe Job Centre to register you\nunemployed. He will then\ndirect you to the Unemployment\nBenefit Office to register. At this stage ask for form B1, as without this you will be\nunable to receive Supplementary Benefit (ie you will get\nnothing).\nWhen you have completed\nform B1, post or take it to\nyour local Department of\nHealth and Social Security\n(DHSS). Also make an appointment for an interview there.\nWhen you go to the interview\nmake life easy as possible by\ntaking along documentary\nevidence of your assets, bank statements ( savings up to \u00a31200 won't affect your\nclaim), together with your\nexpenses such as rent books.\nIf your claim is satisfactory,\npayment commences on the\npay day after your form B1\nhas been received. The amount\nand duration of your benefit\nwill be printed on forms B2/3 when you next sign on at\nthe Unemployment Benefit\nOffice.\nHow Much Will you get?\nThe basic allowance is for\n\u00a310.15 per week if you are not\na householder; to this a rent\nallowance of \u00a31.20 is added.\nRent is paid in full if you are\nresiding at your permanent\naddress. If you go home but\nstill have to pay for your\nterm accommodation, you should\nclaim an Exceptional C irc um stances Addition towards this\ncost.As the single non householder scale rate is the same\nas the vacation al element of\nyour grant, it is unlikely that\nyou will receive any benefit if\nyou go home and are not\npaying for your term accommodation (ie as IC halls and\nhouses\\. Nevertheless, \u2022the\nimportant fact is that you should still claim as the\nDHSS have made no compensation for the parental\ncontribution.\nThe situation can be\ndifficult to comprehend so if\nyou have any problems, please\ncontact the Welfare Centre\nany lunchtime between 12.30\nand 1.30; the Centre is on the\n3rd floor of the Union Building. by IC Union\nWelfare officer\nJohn Morgan\nBonjour young ladies at IF!

She\nmay be hysterical and incoherent, or she may be so calm\nand collected that you have\nnever seen her that way\nbefore. You give her a coffee\nand eventually she tells you that she thinks she has been\nraped, and she does not know\nwhat to do.\nSo now you have to help her; but do you know what she\nshould do? Should she go to\nthe Police Station and report\nit, or should she go directly\nto a doctor? If so, how soon?\nIf she goes to the Police, she\nmay have to go through hours\nof questioning, and you can see that she is in no state to\nbe able to cope with this.\nBesides, she only said that\nshe thought she had been\nraped. As she is reluctant to\ntalk about what actually\nhappened, how do you find out\nif it really was rape?\nWell there is a group that\nyou can phone up, and talk to,\ncalled the Rape Crisis Centre.\nThey will talk to you, share\nexperiences, give you legal\nadvice, go to the Police Station with you.

    "content": "12 - FELIX, DECEMBER3 rd1976 IC 'perversion' - fact\nor fantasy?\nCOLLEGE NOTICE'\nThe Rector and College Administration are in for quite\na shock when they see next\nmonth's press cuttings (for\nIC), if this month's edition of\nLovebirds is anything to go by.\nFor sandwiched in between\nthe stuck pages of this new\nbastion of light-porn is an article on the sex life of us\nstudents at IC. Not that I mind when someone does a feature of my private fantasies, but when the lady concerned\ncalls the resultant article\n' The imps of perversion popping it off in South Ken', then\nI do start to take notice.\nIn point of fact I didn't have anything to do with this\narticle, our ex-printers just\nhappened to drop FELIX a copy. However, if you can identify 'Horny Jim' you may\nbe able to shed some light on this amusing story.\nJim is the only IC student\ninterviewed in Lovebirds, although publisher and editor\nMary Milling ton says that she\ntalked to more students when\nshe came here 18 months ago( Eds note \u2014 The magazine is new and hence works a fair\nbit in advance).\nWhat prompted her to write\nabout the sex life of students?\n\" Well, most students are\npretty articulate and interesting people, and I wondered\nwhy nobody had bothered to\nfind out what their sex lives\nwere for,'\nIn the 2 page article we\nlearn that Jim is tall and dark with a wiry body. He comes over as a conceited\nstud, 'When word got round\nthat 1 was hot stuff you should\nhave seen the numbers of\ngirls that flocked around me.\n1 was the screw of the year as\nfar as some of them were\nconcerned and I never lacked\na girl to take to bed with me',\nsays Jim. Then something changed\nhis attitude to sex and he\nbecame a'm aute male, with\nplenty of kinky sex habits'.\nUp till then Jim had had\n'straight sex', but now\nstarted dabbling in group sex. The rest of the article is a rather graphic portrayal of\nJim' s first group sex experience\nat Romford, Essex, with two\nbisexual girls \u2014 one an ex girlfriend who also goes to IC. 'Well that was horny Jim\n...students are sexy', says\nMiss Millington at the end. But is the article genuine.\n' Yes' said the former nude\nmodel when contacted by\nFELIX. Certainly the photos\noutside the new Huxley\nBuilding of Miss Millington\nare genuine, although she neglects to mention the IC male/female ratio \u2014 but puts\nin that we have 4,000 students\n\u2014 and mentions no bars, etc\nwhere she met students.\n\u2022 There just remains the\nquestion of who 'Horny Jim' is. Details on a postcard . . . . .\nExcessive Absence\nDue to the excessive number of absences during the past year, it has become necessary to put the following new rules and\nprocedures into operation immediately :-1. Sickness No excuse \u2014 the Department Heads will no longer accept\nyour doctor's certificate as proof. We believe that if you are able\nto go to your doctor you are able to attend work.\n2. Death (Your Own)\nThis will be accepted as an excuse. We should like to have\ntwo weeks notice however since we feel it is your duty to train\nsomeone else for your job.\n3. Death (Other than your Own)\nThis is no excuse. There is nothing you can do for them and\nhenceforth no time off will be allowed for funerals. However, incase this should cause some hardship to some employees, there\nare those who might care to note that on your behalf the company\nhas a special scheme in conjunction with the Local Council for\nlunchtime burials, thus ensuring that no time is lost from the job,\n4. Leave Of Absence For An Operation\nWe wish to discourage any thought you may have of needing an operation and henceforth no leave of absence will be granted for\nhospital visits. The management believes that as long as you\nare an employee here, you will need all of whatever you already\nhave and should not consider any of it being removed. We engaged you for your particular job with all your parts, and having\nanything removed would mean that we would be getting less than we negotiated for,\n5. Visit to Toilets Far too much time is spent in this practice. In future the\nprocedure will be that all personnel shall go in alphabetical order\nFor example, those with their surname beginning with the letter\n' A' will go from 9.30 to 9.45am,'B' will go from 9.45 to 10am etc. Note\nThose of you who are unable to attend at your appropriate\ntime will have to wait until the next day when your turn comes\nround.\nFOLK ARTISTS WANTED\nAnyone who wants to play\nwith the Folk Band who grace\nStan's Bar every Saturday is advised to see Stan himself.\nLiquid refreshment in lieu of\npayment will be provided.\nHANDBOOK EDITOR\nAnybody willing to edit\nnext year's It I Handbook\nshould get in touch with John\nWhite, IC Union Honorary\nSecretary, as soon as possible\nat the Union office\nWANT TO WIN TWO TICKETS TO THE IC ENTS'\n1. Which was the last 'Yes' album released in this country?\n2. Who has played drums for Yes, King Crimson, and, more\nrecently. Genesis?\n3. What track takes up Side 2 of Pink Floyd's album\nMeddle?\n4. Who left Pink Floyd after writing many of their early\nhits?\n5.

For all those\nlovely people down at Silwood (I know\nyou're there but you still haven't sent me\na postcard) I have sent you down a cons e ign ment of Discount Cards and these are available from your Committee\n( ICUS PC). See John Mumford (Chairman)\nor Martin Hall( Hon Secretary) for details. NUS and its Service Companies\nAlter the NUS Executive decision the current state of affairs is:( i)N US Travel Ltd has ceased trading\nand is being wound up.( ii) End sleigh Printing Services ( Uni print) has ceased trading and is being\nwound up.\n(iii) Soate and Blackwell Ltd( Photc-me ch) has gone into liquidation.\n(iv) End sleigh Marketing Ltd( NUS Marketing is continuing trading.\n(v)End sleigh Insurances (Brokers) Ltd is continuing trading.\nMatters which would seem to be likely to be of direct relevance to IC students\nwill,I hope, be covered by the following:\n(a) If you have booked with NUS Travel, they will try and get you out on the\nsame scheduling but may not be able to\ndo so. Should you not wish to travel by\nthe new scheduling you can claim a refund.\n(b) NUS Marketing \u2014 calculators,\nsleeping bags, etc are still going, as\n(iv) states, however in a main mail from\nNUS it says:'/ f is our belief that it was\ntoo early to assess the current viability\nof Marketing, and therefore that it should\ncontinue as normal.\" The decision over\nthis must therefore by yours. The forms\nfor Marketing are still available in' the Union Office.( c) End sleigh Insurance is still valid and the company appears to be doing ok. British Rail Student Cards\nAlter the told ing ot the NUS Travel Centres British Rail are now retailing\nthe Rail Cards direct to students. The method by which this may be achieved is as follows:\n(i) Write to British Rail for an app li c ation form (or call in) at the address\ngiven below. Send aS A E.( ii) Fill in the application form and get it signed by your Senior Tutor or\nsimilar ( it' ll probably be best if you get an official stamp on it too)\n(Hi) Send the completed form, two pas sport size photos, and a cheque for \u00a36.50\nmade payable to British Rail, not NUS\nTravel, to the address given below\nand you will receive the Rail Card by\npost.\nThe nearest place to write to is Paddinton Station and the address is: Chief Passenger Manager,\nBritish Rail Western,\nHQ Offices, Paddington Station,\nLONDON W21HAT hat's all for now, take care and see you around.\nOver the last two years, if not for a much longer period, IC Union has been\nlooking very critically at its own structure. 18 months ago the (Working\nParty on Union Resources', chaired by\nGordon Jackson, proposed the creation\nof a new sabbatical post, replacing the\npresent Deputy President. The new\nofficer would be chairman of both House\nand Finance committees.\nThen last year we saw the 'Working\nParty on Union Response % This looked\ncritically at the present committee\nstructure, and rejected the idea of\nenlarging Union Council to form a 'Student Representative Council' as advocated by Pete Teague.\nThis year we have the new Permanent\nWorking Party, a revamped Floor Reps committee, which is looking further at the Constitution and Structure of the Union.\nThat structure has evolved over half\na century, but the form summarised in\nthe diagram below has remained almost\nunchanged since the late 1960's, the days\nof Piers Corbyn, and of the referendum\non Union Structure, which decided to\naffiliate to NUS and not to disband\nthe CC Us. So here's a quick rundown, as one\nhack sees it of the present arrangement.\nThe sovereign body is the Union Geneial\nMeeting, at which all Full( ie current\nstudent) members may vote, and Life members may speak but not vote. It\ndecides all major policy matters, in\nparticular our policies on external\naffairs, residence and refectory policy. The format, for those of you who have never attended (slap your wrists, you naughty people) is Executive reports, elections, motions, and any\nother business. If you want to complain\nabout Felix( say), or Refectory prices, or the reduction in cleaning in halls, dr\nor to call for my resignation for writing such drivel in Felix, \u2014(Verbal Diarrhoea\n- Typist) \u2014 then this is the forum in which\nto do it.\nThe execution of these decisions is then up to (I) the President, who may\ndelegate matters to other members of\nORANGE\nMOLE\nby Derrick\nEverett\nIC Union\nDeputy President\nthe Executive: and/or (ii) Council, in particular regarding the financial\nimplications of the decision.. Council may only refer a matter back to aUG M once, and is an a lag on s to the House of Lords in this respect. Usually Council will refer matters for further debate to\none of its sub-committees.\nIf the decision of U GM or of Council affects the use of Union rooms, eg organising a conference or a jumble\nsale or whatever, arrangements are\ndiscussed by House Committee.\nThis committee also discusses the\nre decoration and furnishing of the\nUnion areas, the booking of rooms and the allocation of rooms and equipment\nfor maximum efficiency. By its very\nnature it controls a large chunk, (on\naverage about 8%) of the Union's income.\nMore generally. Council may refer\nmatters for fuller discussion to (i) the\nPermanent Working Party, ( ii) the\nExecutive Committee, or ( iii) an ad\nhoc Working Party.\nVarious sectional interests are\nrepresented on Council by the chairmen\nof the four (perhaps soon to be six) major sub-committees, the President of\nICWA, the chairman of the Postgraduate\nGroup and the Academic Affairs Officers\nof the CC Us. The dept reps also represent, to some extent, C CU interests\non Council, as do the Presidents of\nCC Us. The latter comprise half of the\nExecutive Committee.\nBetween them the chairman of the\nj ii a j or subcommittees rep rent about 100\nSocieties, the part of the Union with which most readers will be most familiar.\nIt would be impossible for one person\nto co-ordinate the running of all these\nsocieties, although other large Unions\nhave created a sabbatical post for this\npurpose.\nCo-ordination exists between these\nmajor subcommittees by means of the\nprincipal officers (President, D P,H on Continued on page 11\n\n"

The need for more cash( \u00a32,600 instead of \u00a31,300)\ncame as a result of policy changes in the printing\nindustry.\nCouncil felt that by going\nto College for the money it\nwould put next year's A Pin an editorial stranglehold,\nsimilar to that which troubled\nthis year's( and debut) edition.\nThen the College Admissions Policy Committee.( APC)\nordered that the Prospectus be re-edited mid-way through\nprinting.\nNext year'sAP will be the\nfirst one to be fully circulated\nto schools, since last year's, which arrived two week's ago,\nis \u2014 due to the APC ordered\nreprint \u2014 only for internal\ndistribution.\nCopy deadline for the next\nedition is Friday January 14th.

The letters\nconcern the increase in Overseas Students Fees and Post Graduate Fees recently\nannounced.\nUG Md is af fiat es ICU from LSO\nNUS-You'll decide\nIC students will be given the chance to vote in a referendum on whether to remain affiliated to NUS. The\nreferendum will be held in March, at the same time as\ncollege-wide ballot elections for the sabbatical officers of\nIC Union. This was decided at yesterday's Union General\nmeeting, the first to be quo rate in two years.\nCOPY DEADLINE\nFOR NEXT ISSUEMONDAY 2pm It was also decided at the\nU GM by a3 to 2 majority,\nthat ICU should not. re affiliate to the London Students\nOrganisation.\nUproar\nThe decision to organise a referendum was reached after\na noisy debate. Thig resulted\nfrom an attempt to move\nstraight to a vote on the\nmain motion (to have a referendum) immediately after\nthe proposer's speech without\nany opposing speech.\nThis procedural motion\n(that a vote be taken) was carried by a large majority,\nbut uproar followed with cries of 'not democracy' and claims\nfor the right of opposition\nspeech.\nMr Nick Bray shaw, ICU President, pointed out that\nby right the procedural motion\nshould stand, but sensing the\nmood of the opposition,\nquashed it, and allowed a reply to the proposition.\nThe reply took the form of\nan attack on the railroading\n' tactics of the right wing' by\nan unidentified speaker. This prompted RC SUV P Steve\nBraud to call for a card\ncheck of Union members. A check was then held. The meeting then calmed\ndown and\" the vote resulted\nin a clear majority in favour\nof a referendum.\nLSO debate\nAt the LSO debate Mr Trevor\nPhillips, LSO secretary,\n(and ex-President ICU) spoke\nagainst withdrawal from LSO, pointing out that LSO was an organisation designed to\nto help smaller colleges develop through aid supplied\nby larger members.\nHe emphasised that LSO was a young organisation and\nthat large colleges which stayed outside last year have\nnow joined. He said 'ICU\nwould be going against the\ntrend' if it withdrew and that\n'we owe it to smaller organisations to play our part'.\nDespite his eloquence,\n'ICU has little to show for\nmembership of LSO' said Mr\nHugh Barrett (proposer).\n' Objectively we put \u00a3500 a year in and what do we get?\nTrev Phillips and not much\nelse'. The motion not to re a ff li ate was carried by 210 votes to\n141, with 26 abstentions.\nICU has been a member of\nLSO since its formation two\nyears ago, and joined during\nMr Phillips' term as ICU President. However the\nquestion of ICU's affiliation\nhad. never been put to aUG M, this was rectified at y ester day's meeting.\nBenefaction\ngiven new life\nThe anonymous benefactor\nwho of fene dIC \u00a3350,000 to\nbuild an extension to L instead Hall has extended the deadline\non his benefaction to January\n1978.\nAn original condition of the gift was that the College be 'in a position to start\nbuilding on the (extension site\nby January 1977'. This became\nimpractical when Westminster\nCity Council rejected a College plans for the site\nfive weeks ago.\nAfter debating the issue at a Governor's meeting on November 1 9 th, the College has decided not to appeal\nagainst the decision, not to\noppose the ' alternative' Knightsbridge Residents Association's plans, and to consider commissioning a new\ndesign for the extension, dependent upon the view of the\nFine Arts Commission, Dep.Reps.\nto stay\nA proposal that the Department Representatives be\nremoved from Council was defeated by the latter at its meeting on Monday. The proposal came from the\nUnion's Permanent Working\nParty ( P WP), whose spokes man Ros Darling said the\nReps were superfluous and presented no useful business to Council. Opposing the recommendation External Affairs Officer\nHugh Barrett said that Dep Reps were more representative\nof students than the P WP, who\nalong with Old Students reps\nand Constituent College Academic Affairs Officers\nshould be struck off Council. Council rejected the P WP proposal but did not vote on any other proposals to diminish Council's size. A more successful resolution from the P WP, that the Union Executive \u2014 as the Discipline Committee \u2014 must s it within10 days of an alleged discipline offence instead of .the\npresent 2 , was adopted as Council policy. inside\nSPECIAL RAG\n-EDITI0N-See Centre Pages for\nall the fun of RAG\nWeek f eli* "

The ball\nwas wo'n at the line-out and it\nwent right along the three-quarters before Parkinson was tackled, just short of the line.

The result seemed beyond\ndoubt when Dunleary kicked a marvellous drop goal with only\nfifteen minutes to go.\nFurther pressure nearly\nproduced another try for IC but, unfortunately Guy's broke\nquick out of defense, their\nbacks burst through two tack les and their right winger\nsprinted up to the 10 yard line\nbefore cutting inside to score\nunder the posts,5 minutes to hang on\nWith the con vers n>i.i more\nformality, IC had five minutes\nto hang onto a iwo point\nlead.

At one stage it\nseemed as though the London\nUnderground would not be able\nto cope with the IC contingency. The First sHaving finally settled down\nto play water-polo, IC1, who\nstarted play against UCL with\na five-goal deficit, gradually\nmade up the goal difference.\nThe teams were level at full\ntime; IC won the penalty\ncompetition, but just failed to\nrepeat the performance in the\nsecond round.\nThe Seconds .\nIC2 were not quite so successful. They met and fell to a strong Guys1 team, which\ncontained some familiar faces. Nevertheless the IC team did have their moments, Sam made\nhis own contribution to the\ngame, and was sent out twice\nin a row. Then, to the delight\nof the crowd, he scored the\nonly goal for IC2.

The new\nproposals modify those made\nlast July by Fred Mulley,\nbenefiting some home students\nbut adding to the fees of\noverseas students.\n.Originally the DES advocated\nincreases in fees from \u00a3182\u2014\n\u00a3650 for university first\ndegrees and \u00a3416-\u00a3750 for postgraduates. However Mrs\nWilliams said she had been\npersuaded this would cause' excessive difficulties' for\nUniversities and colleges and self supporting students \u2014\ntherefore the fees for home\nstudents would be \u00a3500.\nBut she saw no necessity\nin reducing fees for overseas\nun de graduates particularly\nbearing in mind the fall in the\npound. All postgraduates are\nsubject to massive increases\n- \u00a3750 for home and \u00a3850\nfor overseas students. Some\nof the worst hit will be the\ntwo thousand home postgraduates who are self-supporting.\nFears are growing that\nthese increases will result in closures both of university\nresearch departments and further education colleges, because of falling student\nnumbers. By increasing fees\nthe Government may well be\ndenying the possibility of\nfurther education of financially\npoorer students. Alongside the\nrecent proposals drawn up for\nclosures of further education\ncolleges it would appear that\nthe Labour Government has\n(temporarily at least) abandoned its socialist principles\nof freely available education.\nEven before the increases\nwere announced, Governors\nof several London Colleges, including Bedford and Queen\nMary had written to Mrs\nWilliams opposing any increases, and in his annual\nspeech to the Union Council, the Rector, Sir Brian Flowers also deplored the proposals.\nT^y i^c, To PAy T\"ufT \u00abo^ Pe\u20ac.SAIRBORNE\nIC Radio conducted its first test transmissions at\nSouthside last weekend.\nStation Manager John Allen said that the transmission, of\na test tone, provided encouraging results and that the station hoped to be fully\noperational by July.
