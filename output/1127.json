    "content": "22 Film 23 November 1998\nReviews\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas * * * *\nStarring : Johnny Depp, Benicio Del Toro\nDirector: Terry Gilliam\nF or nearly thirty years, Il unter S Thompson's seminal novel has\nbeen considered un-film able and\nwhen you watch it, you'll soon see why.\nThe plot is minuscule, and virtually vanishes after the first five minutes, when\nall semblance of normality disappears\nand is replaced by a stream of images\nof a hideous, hilarious, drug-induced\nfantasy world.\nIn any normal film, drugged-up\nwould be a simple enough description -a bunch of blok es out of their heads on\nthe Class-A product of their choice. Take\nTrainspotting for example. In this case,\nhowever, it's taken to a whole new level,\nwith more narcotics than you probably\nrealised existed. Gilliam utilise s the possibilities that this presents to the fullest\npossible extent, with images of gentle\nfantasies rapidly turning into full-on\nvisions of hell when the next dose hits.\nIn cinematic terms, this puts Tear and\nLoathing on a completely different visionary plane to any film you've ever seen.\nAll this, of course, requires a top-notch performance from Johnny Deppand this he duly delivers. Stumbling\nthrough this crazy world, he is slowly\ndrowning in a haze of illusion, tie portrays Il unter S Thompson's semi-autobiographical anti-hero without a trace of\nthe deliberation or self-belief that fuelled\nTrainspotting. At no point in the movie\ndoes he attempt to construct a logical\nargument in favour of taking drugs - he\nsimply does it because he enjoys it.\nAll of which makes for a refreshing\nchange, and leaves Depp free to explore\nthe full range of his character. I le flies\nfrom explosive anger to hyperactive\nlunacy to delusional coward in a matter\nof minutes, without a trace of overacting\nor irony. Of course with Johnny Depp's recent series of visits to rehab, the reasons for his great performance might\nhave more to do with personal experience than talent. Or perhaps I'm just\nbeing cruel.\nFans of Gilliam will not come away\ndisappointed, with his trademark weirdness in full effect - indeed Fear and\nLoathing owes far more to his Python\ncartoons than any of his more recent\nwork.\nOn release in the States, Fear and\nLoathing received very mixed reviews\nfrom critics - and Terry Gilliam himself has\ndescribed it as \"a movie you'll either love\nor hate\". With a paper thin plot it's easy\nto see why, as your feelings about the\nmovie hang on your feelings about\nGilliam's masterly use of visuals. Yet even\nif you find much of the film unbelievable\nor massively over the top, you can't help\nbut admire moments like the snake pattern on the carpet crawling up Depp's legs, or his visualisation of the clientele\nof his hotel's bar as real lounge lizards.\nUndeniably weird; undoubtedly cool;\ndefinitely original. If you don't want to\nexperience madness first hand, this is as\nclose as you're ever going to get. Q Dave\nBlade \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nStarring : Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson\nDirector: Stephen Norrington\nAlmost everyone must know the\nrules concerning vampires. Ilo ly water, crosses, garlic, stakes\nthrough the heart, rightful owner of the\nhouse, kill the head vampire, jumpers\nfor goalposts. Marvellous. Blade chucks\nmost of that superstitious stuff out of\nthe window.\nOK, so garlic, sunlight and stakes\nstill work. Silver bullets do too, though like\nthe sex machine in Dust 'til Dawn, I thought that was for werewolves. But\nyou can forget crosses and holy water\nstraight away, along with most of the\nother stuff. Plus, modern technology has\nbrought us sun-block and the science of\nhae mat ology. These are the nineties you\nknow.\nBlade himself is a far cry from a medieval witch-hunter too. Based on the\nlesser known Marvel Comics character,\nhe's got more in common with the sex\nmachine than he has with Stoker's van\nIl el sing. I lis mother was bitten by a vampire shortly before she went into labour,\nyou see, so he was born a 'Daywalker',\nBlade: definitely not to be messed with.\nwith the strength and regeneration of a vampire. I le's still able to walk around in\ndaylight, however, and he's generally a good blok e. Now he whiles away those\nlonely nights hunting vampires in the\nhope that he may one day avenge his\nmother's death...\nAssistance is offered by the token\nbabe and some old blok e who picked\nhim up off the streets in his youth. But\nlet's face it, it's Blade who we came to\nwatch, and Wesley Snipes was perfectly\ncast in this role. Though his acting may\nsometimes be on the more wooden side\nof an exceptionally large block of oak, he\nmakes Jackie Chan look like a rather\nquick moving weakling. Stephen Dorff's not bad in the supporting role either, and\nboth contribute immensely to the overall style of the film.\nAt the end of the day, style is what\nit's all about. There's probably a plot or\nsomething in there somewhere too, but\nwhat there is turns out to be patently\nridiculous, cheesy and ridden with holes.\nYet as Blade minces another army of\nrock hard, super strong vampires with a flick of his wrist, little will be going\nthrough your mind other than \"Il uh... huh... that was cool!\" As for the finale....\nwell, the cinema was cheering for most\nof it.\nBlade is the kind of film which is so\nstylish and quick paced in parts that you\ndon't want to wait until it comes out on\nvideo or even on TV (unless of course\nyou have your own Barco projector) - it\njust works so well on the big screen.\nThe supercilious amongst you will no\ndoubt hate it, but the MTV generation\nmajority won't be disappointed.

    "content": "10 Science 23 November 1998\nWHY SCIENTIFIC PAPERS ARE SO HARD\nTO UNDERSTAND: A POLEMIC.\nA. Jha1\n' Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, University of London.\nSummary: Why do scientists feel that they have to write in exceptionally complicated and unwieldy English? Is it necessary for efficient communication\nto take place between them or is it simply to make sure that no-one else\ncan understand what they could possibly be on about?\nINTRODUCTION\nBefore you go home tonight and start reading that paper for your next lecture\nor practical (stop laughing, there must be a few of you who do), just step back for\na minute and think about what you are about to read. Scientific papers are one of\nthe strangest pieces of communication around. Unless the paper is exceptionally\nwell written and has the reader in mind, you'll need to read it at least twice before\nyou begin to understand anything. At that stage, you will be subconsciously using\nall the technical jargon that you've learnt over your years of study and incorporating it into your view of the paper. Still, it's unlikely that you'll understand it all without answers to a few questions you may have come up with. Try and get lay people\n(or even someone from a different field) to read, never mind understand, it and\nyou've got a whole load of new problems. What makes this bunch of words and\ndiagrams that, after all, are meant to represent the nature that eve ty one lives in seem\nlike a brick wall? A cynic is t would say that this is the way scientists keep themselves\ndistant from the public. They've done years of study and they need some sort of\nstatus symbol to show it. Whether or not this is true, what is certain is the fact that\nthe language of science is a very different animal to that of everyday speech.\nMETHOD\nA paper usually follows a standard-ish format. You probably know this already,\nbut I 'll run through it for thc uninitiated. It starts with an introduction that sets out\nthe background of the field that is about to be studied. A method section then follows and sets out, in an obe ct ive manner, what the experimenters actually did. The\nresults section indicates, well, results in a totally cold and factual manner. There is\nno room for opinion here. The discussion or conclusion part at the end then gives\nthe writer an opportunity to talk about the significance of what they have disco v ered.\nThis structure itself is not what causes the problem. This ordering of information helps more than it hinders. What causes most people problems is the language.\nScientific grammar is notoriously difficult to get your head around. Some feature\nof this include noun phrases, excessive use of the passive voice and o vcr de scrip tion.\nNoun Phrases. These are, as ther name suggests, a grouping together of nouns.\nThings like 'red light diffraction data' or 'nuclear particle decay rate'. Phrases like\nthese are simple enough on the surface. Look deeper, though, and you open a whole can of worms. Each phrase requires a lot of background information and it\nwould be assumed that if you were reading the paper, you would have it. If you\ndidn't have any background, you'd immediately have trouble. Take the first phrase.\nDoes it mean the the data obtained from diffracting red light? Or is it that some\nlight has been diffract ed and wc are looking at some part that has been labelled\nas Ted'? To get rid of this type of ambiguity, a much longer statement would be\nrequired. This 'solution' does not seem to be any better than the problem itself.\nThe Passive Voice. Ehis is where the scientist will detach themselves from the\nexperiment, lor example, take the following statement: \"The two solutions were\nmixed in the test tube and the gases produced were collected.\" It is a grammatically correct sentence but something is missing. Who is actually doing thc ex peri ment? Did thc solutions mix themselves and the gases somehow collect themselves\ninto other test tubes? Of course, this is unlikely but the sentence does not imply\nthat any sort of experimenter was involved. Any active sentences, where thc scientist themselves are doing the experiment in the write-up, seem to be positively\ndiscouraged.\nOverdescription. Quite simply, this adds a lot of description in places where it\nis not entirely necessary. The sentence then ends up unnecessarily long and contains too many ideas for anyone to actually have a chance of understanding any-thing. For example, \"epidemiological and microbiological investigation of a possible\nassociation between infection in sporadic cases and consumption of eggs is\nextremely difficult since eggs are eaten often and recall of egg consumption fades\nrapidly.\" What does this mean? Well, a lot of people eat a lot of eggs and it isn't easy to wot k out which eggs cause infection.\nThere is nothing really wrong, per sc with these types of grammatical structures.\nIt makes things sound formal and seems to give them a lot of authority. Hey, if a scientist can write in a complex manner, surely he has complex thoughts going\nthrough his head and is clever. That's good isn't it? Table 1 shows a nursery rhyme.\nThis will be translated into 'science-speak' and the results are in table 2 and a picture of the subject, Miss Muffet appears in figure 1.\nTABLE 1: Nursery rhyme: \"Little Miss Muffett'\nLittle Miss Muffett sat on a tuff ett, eating her curds and whey.\nAlong came a spider\nand sat down beside her\nAnd frightened Miss Muffett away.\nFigure 1: Miss Muffett during the spider attack.\nRESULTS\nTABLE 2: Translation of nursery rhyme: 'Little miss Muffett\" Into 'Science-speak'\nAn immature female human, M. Muffet, aged 5 years and three\nmonths was observed at rest on a small area of slightly raised grass,\nradius 0.5m. On further observation, it was noted that the subject was attempting to satisfy her appetite by the ingestion of semi-fermented bovine la cta tory by-products. The introduction of the\nvenomous black widow arachnid, 2cm span from leg to leg,\nresulted in a marked behavioural reaction in the subject. Muffet\ndisplayed classic fight or flight responses, including raised adrenal in levels and, In turn, increased heart rate, sweating and pupil\ndilation. The subject accelerated away from the arachnid at the\nrate of im/s2 until she reached a steady velocity of 5 m/s in a norther iy direction. The results suggest that the subject suffers from\nthe mild psychological condition arachnophobia. We suggest further Investigation to determine the extent of this condition, perhaps using choice chambers.2\nEven though this exercise is a little ridiculous, the idea is clear enough. Noun\nphrases, the passive voice and over description all play their part in converting a very\nsimple nursery rhyme into a pseudo abstract for an experiment.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPeople will argue that a lot of the features present in thc writing of scientific\npapers are very necessary - they need to be filled with jargon and they have to assume\nsome background in the subject, otherwise they would run to hundreds of pages.\nPapers are written for professionals by other professionals with the intent that if the\nreader wants to repeat the experiment, they can do so without any ambiguity. All\nthey need is the paper and the equipment. But what's the need to complicate things\nto such an extent that it takes hours to get through and even then with a massively\nfine tooth comb? Scientists the wo tld over will tell you that they don't actually read\npapers unless its absolutely necessary, they seem to get filed away and consulted\nas and when necessary - sometimes never again. Surely this can't be a good thing\nfor science. And it's definitely no good for the public image of science, a debate\nthat's far too large except to touch on here. As the scientific paper gets more and\nmore incomprehensible to the lay person, they get more and more alienated. The\n'us and them' mentality starts to creep into the public perception of science and\nthe two groups of people simply drift further apart.\nAnd so what's the point of this? No more than to make you think a little mote\nabout what you read (and perhaps what you write). You can get back to that paper\nnow.\n2\nJ. McNish, Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine, 1998\n\n"

    "content": "2 News 23 November 1998\nRifle Range Draws a Blank in\nSports Centre Development\nBy Ed Sexton\nThe college's plans for thc further development of the sports centre have caused\nconcern recently, as it app cats that they\nmay leave the Rifle and Pistol Club without a practice range. The weights gym\nin Southside, currently used by the\nWeights Club, is also set to go in favour\nof a new area within the sports centre.\nOriginally a new sports centre was to be\nbuilt on what is currently Ptince's Gardens tennis courts. The plans, however,\nare to extend the current sports centre\nwith the addition of a new floor. The proposals include a large sports hall, which\nwill benefit the majority of indoor clubs,\nas well as a possible fitness studio and\nweights gym. However the plans appear\nnot to include a rifle range.\nThe current range utilised by thc\nRifle and Pistol Club is in thc sports centre near thc swimming pool, but this is\nset to be transformed into another facility, possibly further changing rooms.\nThis could lead to problems for the club;\nCharlie Joynt, Athletics Clubs Committee\nChair and former Deputy President\n(Clubs & Societies), commented that the\nremoval of the range would \"almost certainly lead to a fall off in membership and\na loss of interest\". He did admit that thc\narchery section of the club may be able\nto use the new hall, while most ACC\nclubs would benefit from the proposals.\nMeanwhile the planned removal of\nSouthside's weights gym leaves the possibility of the Weights Club having to\npay to use the sports centre's facilities.\nBen Maddison, President of thc Weights\nClub, stated that he had been informed\nthat thc club would- be able to block\nbook any times during the week for club\nuse, fearing for his club's future he stated\n\"the upshot of all this is that we will no\nlonger be a weights dub but just a fig-ure head\". He commented, however,\nthat the club's expansive membership\n(over 300 members) made it difficult to\nrestrict use to particular times of the\nweek; \"The system we have now is able\nto cater for all our members but if we\nmoved then there would be serious\nproblems.\"\nSummer Ball '99\nBy Sunll Rao\nFollowing the grand success of the last\nImperial College Summer Ball, a far more\nspectacular event is being planned for\nnext summer. With the huge influx of\nmedical students, the ball promises to be\nbigger and better than before.\nLast year, over 1300 tickets were sold\nwith nearly 400 people on a waiting list,\nfor this year's bash, plans are afoot to\nbook the main hall of Alexandra Palace\n- with a capacity of over 5000. The ball\npresents students with a unique opportunity to herald the coming of the summer - especially for the final years who\nhave finished their courses. Last year's guest speaker, children's TV host Johnny\nBall, was quoted as saying that he liked\nit so much he plans to bring his da ugh ter, Radio 1 DJ Zoe Ball, along next lime.\nRumours arc also circulating that thc\nUnion are looking to book Michael Palin\nas after-dinner speaker for the event.\n(We've also heard rumours that \"Essex\nGirl\" aka \"Basildon Babe\" Denise van\nOuten is going to turn up as well.) Of\ncourse, nothing has been confirmed yet.\nAlong with a live band, the organisers arc hoping to arrange a full f unfair as\nwell. Amir Hasan, spokesman for the\nevent, says: \"The Summer Ball is a great\nend-of-year event. Everyone's finished\ntheir exams and is looking forward to\nstarting the summer. It's a great opportunity to get dressed up smartly and\nhead down to an amazing venue with\nthe whole college with good food and\ngreat ents.\"\nAn arts aspect is to be introduced to\nthe show through the world of fashion\nand design. The organisers are hoping\nto give the ball more of a grand appeal\n- to make a more glamorous and exciting event. The current plan is to hold the\nevent on a Saturday to avoid traffic problems and allow adequate preparation\ntime. The organisers are determined not\nto repeat the problems of last year with\nbuses - London Underground has quoted\nprices on hiring entire tube trains for\nafter the event.\nThe Summer Ball Committee consists of a group of eight committed and\nenthusiastic individuals looking after\neverything from corporate and product\nsponsorship to the entertainments. AnyIn brief.\nCareers Galore\nAround fifty companies were present at\nthe Careers Fair, held in thc Union and\nBeit Quad last Wednesday. This year's fair was generally more successful than\nprevious years, with thc addition of a marquee in the Quad allowing more\nspace for students to see what was on\noffer. The event was well attended,\nwith several thousand students taking\nthe opportunity to gain information\nabout employment in finance, IT and\nindustry. Companies and student alike\nseemed satisfied with the event.\nConsoc Visit\nLast Wednesday Cheryl Gillan voiced her\nconcerns over Nuclear Power safety in\nRussia and the Millennium bug issues,\nparticularly as she visited power stations\nin her capacities at the DTI. Leaving\nEurope aside, the possible abolition of\nhereditary peers, Mayor of London and\nProportional Representation issues were\nall raised. Gillan was more open about\nher life in politics than previous speak-ers, and in addition a little less reserved,\nresulting in a more informal occasion.\nShe gave the impression that politics\ncan be fun, and wants to encourage\nmore women to enter politics, although\nat this meeting the fairer sex weren't rep-resented.\nKEEP1 II I: CAT I' Rf I \u2022 \u2022 EST. 1949\nissue 1127\n23 November 1998\nEditor: Ed Sexton\nNews Editors: Andy Ofori & Jonas Lindsay\nPhotographic Editor: William Lorenz\nMusic Editors: Jason Ramanathan and\nDennis Patrickson\nI ilm Editor: David Roberts\nSports Editor: Gus Paul\nArts Editor-.

I was there at the front of the Free Trade\nFlail back in '66 hollering 'Judas!' berating his hig ness Zimmerman for selling\nout to the Man. But Appalachian folk\nsongs, Kristin? For crying out loud! I mean, I know Neil Young sang, 'Old\ntimes were good times' and these murder and drinking ballads may remind\nyou of childhood - a time before the\npain, a time before you looked into the\nabyss and, well, fell right in, to the very\nbottom. Or have I Just got the wrong end\nof the stick? Is this an exorcism that I'm listening to or are you confronting the\nghosts of the past that have haunted you\never since?\nWhatever the case may be, it's not\neasy to stomach. Down in the Willow\nGarden, Banks of the Ohio and Whole\nI leap of Little Horses work, the latter\nseemingly being reinterpreted as a touching communication to your kids\nand Banks.... telling a tale of spumed love\nevolving into fatal retribution benefits\ngreatly from your countrified twang of a vocal and the simple moan of an electric organ. As for the rest? I'm not sure\nhow to put this but no matter how many\ntimes I listen, the music just creates the\nurge to shout, 'Yee-Il ahl' or tunelessly\nbellow, 'I'm Popeye the sailor man.' Sorry\nKristin. That just isn't good enough. 0\nChris\nKURUPT\nKuruption\naround ;\nthis alb u though.

Originality\nwas lacking and the edge that\nhad made hip-hop so good in the early\ndays seemed to have disappeared. Up\nthen sprung Death Row from the west\ncoast, a recording label with what\nseemed like that little something extra.\nI lip-hop heads jumped for joy as they\nall praised the likes of Dr. Dre, Tupac\nand Snoop Doggy Dogg. It seemed that\na new force was born, and Kurupt was\namong them.\nSadly, with hindsight, the Death Row\noutput wasn't actually very good. Apart\nfrom Warren G's chart classic Regulate\nand Snoop's first album Doggystyle, most\nof what was produced can only be\ndescribed as good for hip-hops few years\nin the cold. Thankfully Wu Tang et al\nfinally brought us out of this rut and\nDeath Row and the majority of its artists\nfell by the wayside. But here we are, five\nyears on and Snoop and Kurupt have\nboth brought out new albums. It would\nhave probably been best for all concerned if Snoop had been found guilty\nof accessory to murder and his musical\noutput had been halted after Doggystyle.\nBut he has carried on in one way or\na no the t and most of what he's done has-n't been worth a second listen, the new\nalbum included. Kurupt, however, seems\nto have moved on.\nRather than getting bogged down,\nor even killed, in all that east coast -west coast argument rubbish, Kurupt\nhas managed to avoid the trap that has\ncaught most Death Row artists and has\nproduced an album combining flav out s from both sides of the states. The album\ncomes in a double CD pack; one for the\neast coast and one for the west, and the\nsounds on each represent each of the\nsounds excellently.\nThe tunes are pure hip-hop, and\nwest coaster Kurupt steers well clear of\nanything that might be misconstrued as\ngangsta rap. Another big plus is that\nKurupt takes the chance to introduce a number of new stats on the album rather\nthan relying on the big names to spice\nup his poetry.\nSo Kurupt lives on while others have\nfaltered and from what we get on Kuruption he'll probably be living it large for\nquite some time.

    "content": "23 November 1998 Arts 15\nSITE CONSTRUCTION South London Gallery\nAs I entered I could not help noticing the broken plasterboard on\nthc floor, which I assumed was\nconnected to thc theme of Site Construction. After falling through slabs of\nplaster up lo my ankles, I was thinking\nless about thc issue behind the supposed artwork and more about my dirty\nshoes.\nThc artists originated from Berlin and\nas the press spiel suggested we would\nsee some political background to the\nartwork, however the latent political\nmeaning was probably exactly that.\nThc lu wie sI spoke to had difficulty\nthemselves in determining thc ideas\nbehind the work. But with pieces that\ncould be best described as shaped hunks\nof chip board nailed together, I understand their turmoil. After attending I learnt about the finer points of install a tion, in essence it means taking objects\nand showing them in a place in which\npeople view art, in this case a gallery. The\nexhibition included many tele-visual displays depicting\neverything\nfrom cycle\nengines being\ndismantled to\ncargo ships.\nPerhaps\none of thc\nmost provocative pieces\nwas a looped\nvideo of a naked middle-aged woman with a metal box in the\ndesign of a house over her head, which\nwas subsequently banged against the\nwall (Hausfrau swinging, pictured). Presumably, the artist was trying to provoke\ndomesticity issues (I had to ask), however\nmy first response was: how much did\nthey reimburse the woman for losing so\nmany of her neurons?\nAfter some\ntime staring at\nthe video of the\ncargo ship,\nwhich simply\nploughed\nth tough thc\nocean, I gave\nup on the questions of why\nand started on\nthe question of\n_ how someone\ncan call this artistic and moreover what\nam I doing here looking it! Had I found\nan antenna, I would have tuned into\nEldorado repeats if they were showing.\nThe highlight of the evening was a quick rendition of someone German\nyelling words, seemingly at random, to\nthe delight of the audience. Much to the\naggravation of my inner ear, the yelling\nwas interspersed with a two-tone performance on a tin whistle.\nMany moons ago, a lecturer\nexplained that mathematics is very beau-ti ful. At the time, I and the rest of the\ntutorial thought he was rather mad. But\nnow I realise that I too would rather look\nat a board full of equations than a picture\nof turf. Admittedly I was sceptical of modern art before, but this exhibition has\ndone nothing but re-affirm my beliefs.\nBTD\nUntil 20th December\nNearest Tube: tle phant and Castle\nAdmission: FREE\nOpening hours: daily except Mondays\nECSTASY Arts Theatre\nOn the face of it, the plot of this\nplay is not inspiring. Set in a Kilburn bed-sit in 1979, it is a glimpse into the life of Jean - a singularly\nmoody individual, with a bit of a drink\nproblem, who is trying to sort out her life.\nAct one details her problematic and loveless relationship with her boyfriend Roy.\nAct two consists entirely of a drunken\nevening involving Jean, her friend Dawn,\nDawn's husband Mick and their old mate\nLen.\nDo not be fooled by this. The show\npresented by About Face Productions is\na hilarious, touching, brilliantly acted and\nwell directed West-End debut by a new\ncompany, which thoroughly deserved\nthe standing ovation that it got on the\nPress Night.\nMike Leigh (of Secrets and Lies\nfame) has, in Ecstasy, produced a script\nwhich is an acutely observed, but also\npainfully accurate portrayal of real life. It\nhas to be one of thc most 'real' depictions of life that I have seen for a long\ntime, underlining the banality of modern\nexistence, particularly in the language\nwhich is full of platitudes and clich es. It is also a play which, although written and set in 1979, has dated surprisingly little, largely because it deals very\nmuch with human nature rather than\ntopical issues. Thc set and costumes are\nexactly right for the period, but the emotions and sentiments expressed in the\nplay are still extremely relevant today.\nThe cast made the most of the mate-rial, squeezing every last drop of humour\nand meaning out of thc script with fantastically realistic acting from everyone.\nI was particularly impressed with the\ndrunk scene, which is the best I 've ever\nwitnessed (on the stage at any rate).\nWatching Mick stumbling round the\nstage, I felt as though I was watching it\nfrom the inside. I could remember, rather\ntoo clearly, those moments when I too\nhave been in a similar state (though that\nmay have had something to do with the\ncouple of drinks at the interval). I just sat\nthere thinking 'Yeah, it really is like that.\nThat's brilliant!' It was amazing to watch\nthe company construct an intriguing and\nfunny show out of a script which, if\npoorly done, could have left thc audience bored to tears, or laughing at, ra the t than with, thc cast.\nThe show is comedic, poignant, and\nmagnificently staged study of the mundane that I heartily recommend to every-one.\nTom Dane\nUntil 19th December\nNearest tube: Leicester Square\nPerformance times: Tuesday - Saturday\n8pm, Sundays 7pm Tickets: concessions \u00a37.50\nTESS OF THE D 'URBERVILLES New End Theatre\nHardship, hope, affection, tragedy,\nlove, loss, marriage, murder, love\nagain and then death. Tess has\nall of the emotions and just when you\nthink everything will get back on track...\nwell life simply gets worse\nIf you haven't read the book, here's a quick outline of thc plot: Tess is a young country girl from Marlott driven by\npoverty into what she believes is her\nwealthy relations' home. She is abused\nby her 'cousin' and is forced to leave and\nwork on a dairy farm. There she and a man named Angel Clare fall in love and\nmarry. On their wedding night she confesses her 'sin' with hot cousin, so he\nleaves her and goes to Brazil. Thinking\nhim dead, she marries her reformed\ncousin, but Angel reappears. She is so\noverjoyed to see him that she kills her\nnew husband and she is hanged fot hot\ncrime.\nClassic Thomas Hardy, then. But this\nproduction has a musical side. Yes, we\nwere sceptical too, but don't get the\nwrong idea. The music, by Anthony Feldman, is appropriate and does not detract\nfrom the story or dialogue. The well\nplaced, unaccompanied songs, all in the\nstyle of the period,\nnot only smooth\nover the scene\nchanges but also\ncomplement the\nstory and events,\nportrayed so cleverly\nby all the actors any-way.\nCelia Hcncbury\nas Tess is good at\npulling the most\nmiserable and tragic\nfaces imaginable,\nand her skill at playing the part is\nequally impressive. T without exception and whilst sparse the\nscenery was extremely dynamic. Four\nblocks were used as a grain crusher,\nhorse and carriage, milk parlour and\nbeds. Although they managed to be con-vinci ng, it was perhaps slightly hard to follow if you aren'tamil iar with the\ns to ty. What could\nalso be confusing\nwas that the seven\nactors in the company had to play all\nof the characters of\nMBi Ihe novel. Ila ving said this, both kept\nyour attention and\nmade for a compelling three hours.\nDifficult scenes\nwere portrayed with\nsensitivity - the rape\nscene was very tactfully done. However, perhaps not enough attention was\npaid to Tcss1\ndeath in the end. Admittedly, Michael try's adaptation is faithful\nto the book, but for the theatre, wc felt\nalmost robbed of an opportunity to really\nbawl our eyes out.\nConsidering that The Classic Reaction\nTheatre Company was only founded in\n1996, it showed remarkable organisation and expertise in pulling off a wonderful production. Their ability to spot\nyoung, emerging talent seemed to bring\nthe actors together as a real team. They\nworked so well that we came out of thc\ntheatre thoroughly depressed and very\nintrospective. In fact, wc were almost\nready to end it all until we spotted Dale\nWinton at Hampstead McDonalds in his\nleather trousers which cheered us up\nno end!\nJudith and Christian\nUntil 6th December\nNearest tube: Hampstead\nPerformance times: Tuesday - Saturday\n7.30pm Tickets: concessions \u00a37\n\n"

Instead it's the adaptation of Victor\nHugo's classic novel (upon which the\nmusical and countless stage plays have\nbeen based).\nSadly, however, the motivation\nbehind the movie becomes clear all too\nrapidly. Picture the scene: some greedy\nHollywood producer is wandering\nthrough the $1 classics section of his\nlocal bookstore, looking for the next costume drama to provide a nice fat pay day.\nHe spots a copy of Les Miserables and\nrealised that the musical had done all the\npublicity work for him. Money in the\nbank, surely.\nWell, probably not, thanks largely to\na phenomenally dull re-telling of a story\nthat's been committed to film fourteen\ntimes before. Obviously, director August\n(a Danish director who has only made\none film in the English language) was\nunder strict instructions not to deviate\nfrom the standard costume drama template - decent cast, nice location (Prague\npretending to be nineteenth century\nClaire Danes sports Chanel's new \"Costume Drama\" look\nParis) and stirring strings on the sound-track. Yet it's such a deadpan re-creation\nof the original story that you may as well\nbe watching a movie about the history\nof the French railway system.\nYou can't blame the cast; you can't really blame the director; all you can do\nis ponder why on earth this film got\nmade at all.

Never fearing the bl an tant ly obvious or overly crude gag, Mike Myers\n(writer and star of Wayne's World) packs\nninety minutes with more comedy than\nyou can possibly take in at one sitting,\nmaking this a great movie to buy.\nIn essence, it's a fairly basic parody\nof sixties crimefighter s( Bond in particular) meets the modern world.

But it's the quality of the effects\n- done for 'real', and as a result so much\nbetter than today's CGI tests - that make\nthis a classy bit of Bond.

    "content": "6\nLetters 23 November 1998\nWorld AIDS Day\nDear Felix\nI am writing to draw the attention of the\nreadership to thc majo t world event that\nis approaching on 1 December, World\nAIDS Day 1998. It is the eleventh such\nday and this year the international theme\nis young people, 10-24. The United\nNations Joint Programme on AIDS\n(UNAIDS) have decided on this campaign for three reasons:\n1. Over a third of those infected with\nHIVin the world today ate young people.\n(That's about 10 million.)\n2. About half of those infected after\ninfancy are under 25.\n3. Young people are seen as a force\nfor change.\nIn the UK the major affected group\nhas been gay/bisexual men, though the\nreported spread in the straight population has risen dramatically from 9% of all\nUK cases in 1987 to 31% last year. With\nthis in mind I would like to ask the readers to be aware of AIDS and show this by\nwearing a red ribbon and putting donations in collection tins that will appear\nover the next few weeks.\nThanks\nStef t vans( IQ Secretary)\nA Final Word? Please?\nDear Ed,\nWhat now? Can it be that Mr Emohare is\nresorting to muddying the name of one\nof his fellow medics, in order to try to preserve some degree of authenticity? This\nwouldn't have the smacking s of a man\ndesperately seeking excuses having\nbeen humiliated by a balanced editorial?\nSurely this isn't the same fine upstanding\nindividual, that tried in his 1st year S.U. elections to curry favour with the voters\nby offering pints for votes?\nWe freely admit that we and some of\nour colleagues have in the past found\nsome Felix articles laughably inaccurate,\nbut would like to add that the editorial in\n1125 was warmly received by many of\nour number at the Cross due to its fair\nappraisal of the situation.\nThose that he accused of \"defacing\"\nhis letter were trying to save him and\nthose he aimed to represent some humiliation by correcting the grammar and\nspelling, which he subsequently chose to\nignore. It seems rather presumptuous\nthen, to say that as 60% of the CX 2nd year signed the letter that it can be safely\nassumed at least 60% of them must be\nsupporting him.\nYours sincerely,\nAlex Fletcher and Mark Ballard\n(CX 2nd Year)\nDear Felix,\nI was present in the lecture when Mr\nEmohare handed round his petition and\na few copies of the accompanying letter.\nHe did indeed state that no-one was\nunder any obligation to sign it and the letter was circulating for people to read -1\nhave never disputed this.\nHowever the fact remains that some\npeople did sign thc petition before or\nwithout reading thc letter, this is not Mr\nEmohare's fault but neither is it mine. It\nreached me having had numerous comments written on it by fellow students,\nsome querying his facts, spelling, grammar and others expressing their opinions.\nI had not intended to become involved\nin the matter. However since many comments had been added I added a paragraph at the bottom in which I stated that\nI agreed with some of the points that he\nhad made but disagreed with others and\nthought that a petition was not perhaps\nthe best solution to the issues raised. I hardly think that this constitutes deface-ment. The letter was passed on afterwards along the row and since according\nto Mr Emohare there were several copies\nof the letter circulating I can hardly be\naccused of \"hogging\" the letter either.\nFrom my view, I hope this is the end of\nthc matter.\nYours,\nClare Ashwin\n(Medic, felix reporter & letter deface r) Dear Felix,\nWith reference to the letter submitted by\nMr Karan Kapoor in issue number 1126.\nI speak, hopefully, on behalf of all the\nmembers of Imperial College, in saying\nthat we are in no manner biased against\nmedics, or against anyone in ICSM. Wc\nput it to you, Sir, that for your personal\nsatisfaction, you are undoubtedly driving\na wedge between all the Imperial f acul ties. It is purely immature to state the\npassion of medics is far greater than that\nof the other students. Imperial College\nhas a history of excellence in virtually all\nits fields, and it is for these reasons stu-dents, such as myself, have come to this\ninstitution, to attain not only academic\nstrength, but strength in all extra curricular activities.\nYour secret admirer\nDear Mr Sexton,\nIn retrospect, I suppose it was rather suicidal to take on the Felix Mafia, even with\nover a hundred signatures backing mc.\nSo being up against the likes of Simon\nBaker, who have a whole page dedicated to the airing of the thoughts that\nemanate from their musty brains, it came\nas no surprise then when he dedicated\nhalf his article to slating mc. I refuse,\nhowever, to be drawn into answering his\nprovocations.\nAt no time in my famous letter did I accuse le lix or any individuals of being\nracist. What I was against was the sensationalist tone taken by your articles.\nAnother point which could have been\nmore clearly expressed was the fact that\nthe majority of medical students at The\nCross were from the ethnic minorities,\nnot IC as a whole.\nI hope we can now draw a line\nunder this episode and move on. No\nhard feelings (but no apologies either).\nMr O Emohare\nStick It Out!\nDear Ed,\nIn response to the front page article last\nweek I would like to state that I feel that\nthis was entirely due to lack of commit t ment from the individuals concerned\nand not because of failure of the ICSM\nstudent union body.\nWhilst fully appreciating the work\nthat members of the medics student\nunion do, I think that if elected into a position they should put their heart and\nsoul into the job. I do realise that their\nwork may have been made particularly\ndifficult by some of the students and\nstaff who find the merger a problem, but\ndropping out because they \"did not want\nto be a part of a union that was failing\"\njust serves to demonstrate lack of staying\npower.\nOn the other hand I would like to\ncongratulate the other members of the\nmedics student union for their very hard\nwork in what is not exactly an ideal situ-ation.\nMy second point is in response to\nSimon Bakers comment that medics think\nthat they are 'very different' because of\nthe length and nature of their course.\nDissection of thc human cadaver, caring\nfor terminally ill patients, talking to\nbereaved relatives etc. are extremely\nemotionally draining and upset ing things\nto deal with, and as far as I am aware do\nnot form major elements of any other\ncourse at Imperial. Some students often\nfind sharing these experiences with fellow medics, those in other years who\nhave been through the same traumas\nand problems, a great help.\nYours sincerely,\nAlex Cope\n(Medic 3rd year SM)\nComic is Cool\nDear Felix\nThe comic is ace, simple as that. Okay,\nmaybe using the C word was a bit strong,\nbut apart from that it was pte tty cool. The\nbit with the lecturer in a bathtub of baked\nbeans was bloody good I thought. Okay,\nmoronic the comic might be, but re mem ber, not everyone at IC is a complete\ngenius. Some of us only just made it past\nthe A level entry requirements, like yours\ntruly.\nYours truly,\nRichard Ferris\nJCR Stuck in the Past?\nDear Felix,\nI 've noticed the LED scrolling message\ndisplay in the JCR, next to the QT snack\nbar what s is ta few times now, and find\nit rather amusing that it is STILL advertising \"The Addams Family\" at ICU cinema.\nIt also advocates visiting an Anderson\nConsulting careers meeting. Given that\nthe date is in 1994, I reckon that there's a fair chance that this meeting has been\nand gone... Heck, even the clock on thc\ndisplay is wrong!\nHow about running a competition to\nsee if anyone can come up with a more\nuseful message on it. Oh, and correct the\nclock too.\nCheers,\nRichard Hopkins (EE UG3)\nMore Erroneous Editing\nMr Sexton\nI agree with Mr Mark and think you\nshould edit letters for sp eling and;\ngramma,\nSeriously, it is distracting to see\nspelling mistakes and basic grammatical\nerrors while reading any document and so\neasy to overlook them while proofreading\none's own work. Unless the meaning of\nthe letter is ambiguous I don't think there\nis any reason to allow obvious errors onto\nthe pages of Felix. In the case of more\nsubtle points of grammar I would see it as\nacceptable to leave these in since they are\nunlikely to distract the reader from thc\nmeaning of the letter.\nAlso, could you introduce Mr Baker\nto the concept of paragraphs; his last\npiece appeared to be constructed from\n3 huge ones. Although his lucid style\nallowed the meaning of the first 2 to be\nclear, the third was rather difficult to fol-low.\nRoss Newell\n\n"

The\nfirst half ended 18-0 to IC, the players\nonly just starting to wake up. The ref.\nmanaged to have his say and overruled\nthe touch judges to disallow a perfectly\ngood conversion. In the second half the\nt ties and the opposition injuries began\nto flow.\nGood tries from Gol, Hogg and Cunnel lifted the pace and UCH centre tried\ntop distract them by having his finger\nsnapped in half and impressing all with\nhis cont ott ionis m. More tries came\nfrom Kaisen & Sven, who fins i he d thc\nday off. Tref scored two tries and was\nfantastic.\nCricket\n\"It's November, why is there Cricket on\nthe sports page?\" you ask. Well, I need\nto the fill the space and this seemed as\ngood a way as any, so here goes:\nThe Felix 1998/99 Ashes Preview!\nWhen it comes to cricket most people agree there is nothing better than an\nAshes contest. The series started at the\nGabba in Brisbane on Friday morning,\nand England will be hoping for a large\nslice of luck, going up against an incredibly strong Australian side that lacks only\nShane Warne to make it the strongest\npossible one.\nEngland expected Mike Atherton to\nplay in the match, despite a long-term\nback injury flaring up. The toss will be\ncrucial and as the Gabba pitch usually\nfavours the batsmen, Alec Stewart will be\nlooking to put the Aussics in first. If that\nhappens England's bowlers must not\nwaste the new ball, as they have in the\npast. Limiting the Australian totals is\ncrucial to success throughout the series\nand letting them run up huge totals will\njust put pressure on an already fragile\nEngland batting line-up, which will\ninevitably collapse horribly.\nEven without Shane Warne, I cannot\nreally see England winning the series.\nMy prediction: 3-1 to Australia. Gus\nNo Score Given\nUnder a blood red sky, the stage of\npain was prepared, (oh dear - Gus)\nAdrenaline pumping, muscles throbbing and veins pulsating the warriors\nwere ready and eager for battle. The\nscore was set for IC 2nd's crushing\ndemolition job. Trys were scored with\nrandom case du ting a hectic 1st half,\nwith good support play, securing a467 lead after 40 minutes. Expectations\nwere high for a century victory, though\na degree of complacency set in during\nthe first 20 minutes, until the flood gates\nopened and IC II began to show the\nform we have all come to know and\nlove. The final score line demonstrated\nthe continuing form and sexy style of\nthis crack outfit.\nNotable tries by thc elusive Flying Flo\nand the mind boggling skills and speed\nof the park stud, Oily Conga. Well done\nOily.\nBoat Club\nLast weekend saw the \"Fullers head of\nthe River Fours\" - the first race of the\nyear for the boat club. The sponsor's generosity in offering\nfree drinks at the brewery for category\nwinners managed to coax many of the\ncrews into competing in reputedly one\nof the toughest faces of the year. Competition was fic t ce with over 220 competitors (511 crews) battling out the time\ntrial-style race on the Thames \"reverse\nboat-race\" course from Mortlake to Putney. Competitots included World and\nOlympic champions (including Steve\nRedgrave), universities, colleges, schools\nand clubs.\nImperial had several crews entered\nand all raced well in thc fast tailwind con-ditions, most boats finishing within the\ntop 100. We came away with a win in\nthe competitive sc nio t cox less fours\n(28th overall) and with victory just stolen\nfrom a strong senior two cox ed four by\nan astoundingly good Oxford boat, now\nbeing investigated by race organisers.\nBasketball\nThe IC Basketball Club could not have\ndreamt of a better start of the season in\nthe Men's BUSA Merit League! Four\nmatches, four wins and three of them\naway, too. Out first match against GKT\nproved to be tougher than initially\nthought, mainly because we hadn't had\na single practice before it. Yet, even\nthough every player was given court\ntime and a great deal of defensive and\noffensive experimentation was done,\nthe final score gave us a comfortable win\nby 71-58. UCH seemed to prove a more\ncompetent opponent but when IC put its\nfull force at play the UCf Medics could\nonly watch us...\nIn thc matches against UCL and\nKing's, however, we showed our real\nqualities this year: tight and efficient\ndefence, as well as ability to retain control of the game, even when the opponents seem to get away. In both matches\nIC came from behind, 15-25 in thc UCL\nSnooker\nIt was a cold and wet Sunday morning\nwhen the team members of Imperial's Snooker teams travelled to their first\nmatch of the season - away at\nSouthampton. The team was a mix of\nold and new and there was an excited\natmosphere as they entered thc venue\nof last year's BUSA Nationals where they\nhad put up such a resolute performance.\nThc new look A team found the going\ntough as a close match was eventually\nwon 17-15 by Southampton. The B team\nwere the real success story here with an\ninspired 23-9 victory including excellent\nefforts by Peter Cheung and David Elliott.\nCross Country\nImperial College travelled to Wimbledon\nCollege for the third race of the London\nColleges League. After negotiating some\ndod gy tube timetables we finally arrived\nto kick womb les. IC finally managed to field a women's team with captain Bethan leading the team home in second place.\nDebutant Vic Farmer powered to 17th with Zoe Quinn scoring in 25th. The men's race set off at a rapid\npace with many runners fading badly as\nsoon as they hit thc hill situated halfway.\nULU captain Ben Hukins led thc\nteam home in 3rd with Andy Pritchard\n5th. IC's first team, benefitting from the\nabsence of a strong Brunei team, registered some respectable placings with\nTarik (13th), Mike (25th), debut ante Dan\nCarrivick (26th) and Dave (29th). match and 11-27 in the King's one only\nto take the lead early in the second half.\nThese two victories seem to ensure our\nCollege the first position in the Merit\nLeague for the first time ever and what\nis more, probably undefeated.\nNow our thoughts are on December's draw for the knock-out stages. Pethaps this year we will have just the bit of\nluck we missed in the last two years,\nwhen we were narrowly (as narrowly as\npossible, actually) eliminated at the\nround of the last 16.

    "content": "23 November 1998 Music 19\nVELOCETTE\nFour Fold Remedy\nPLEXIQ\nvelo cet te Spoiled Children. The\nmellow single from\nFour Fold Remedy\nVelo cet te supported Kenickie on\ntheir recent tour. Kenickie split\nup soon after. Whether\nVelocette's dreary d urges had any influence on the break up is debatable, but\nI must say listening to their new album\nFour Fold Remedy did not exactly leave\nme invigorated with a will to do great\nthings.\nVelocette have obviously put a lot of\neffort into the production. Too much, in\nfact. They try so hard to produce what\nthey think is an intriguing patchwork of\nmelodic beauty, that they miss the point\nthat the songs are actually supposed to\nbe enjoyable to listen to. So much concentration is devoted to making each\nSingles\nphrase, bar and note sound 'nice', the\nwhole song suffers as a whole.\nSo often, the songs start off with a beautiful, mellow intro, only to be ruined\nby the vocalist's annoy ln gly \"gentle\" and\n\"lilting\" voice. The lyrics don't do the\nalbum any favours either. It was a mistake to have them printed on the sleeve.\nIt just draws attention to how tedious\nthey are.\nMaybe I'm being a little unfair. Like\nall music, it gets better the more you listen to it. There are occasions when it\ndoes work, and the music just seems to\nflow. Notably, La Sirena and Where are\nwe?. an instrumental piece with plenty\nof Hammond organ and congas, are\nparticularly stirring. On first listen to the\nalbum, I was sure that I wouldn't get any\nenjoyment from it, so this was a nice sur-p rise. To give some idea of the style, if you\nlike Kristin Hersh (post-Throwing Muses)\nor early Belly, you might appreciate this,\nfor me, it was like listening to Kenickie\nbut with all the energy, wit and vibrancy\nremoved.\nAll in all, there's a distinct lack of orig-in ali ty. This album could have been\nreleased ten years ago and nobody\nwould have batted an eyelid. Four Fold\nRemedy is not going to change any-one's life. H Tom Bailess\nH mmm...German electronica.\nOkay...not really my sort of\nmusic. Lots of dod gy samples\nover the top of wandering, heavy, electronic beats. Mix with it the odd\nGerman vocal or too, perhaps expressions about Neo-Nazism or chants\nabout happy hard-core drugs and a persons right to fall over a lot, and you get\nthe kind of music that, frankly, the\nGermans can keep. Perhaps a little\nextreme, but this is what I was expecting when I saw the cover of Blech, the\ndebut album from Frankfurt outfit\nPlcxiq. I was only partially wrong. It IS a collection of dod gy samples over some\nheavy beats, both drum and bass, break\nbeat and plain dance. However two or\nthree of the tracks are actually pretty\ngood. Memories stands out for its\nwicked guitar riffing over cool break\nbeats, whilst Mais a really funky bass\nline and some amusing sounds that\ncombine with the sampled lines 'god\nspeed, god speed John Glenn' to good\neffect. The title track - Blech - is a decent, nifty little number, with booming drums and interesting backing that\ndefinitely makes your toes tap.\nUnfortunately, this is about exiting as it\ngets. Most of the samples sound an\nawful lot like they have been taken\nfrom an old Spectrum arcade game. I was constantly reminded of a small yellow ball bouncing along on lop of\nmusic lyrics, whilst a dod gy video plays\nin the background and some really\ndrunk k are oke singer proceeds to make\na complete dick of him/herself. Boing\nbo ing bing bang plo pppp screech...nice. Okay, it's not that bad, I am just a bit pissed off because I didn't get to review the latest U2 album\n(thankfully I didn't end up with Robbie\nWilliams), but it really isn't good either.\nIn fact it's a bit neutral really. A few\nsongs begin to titillate my senses but\ntoo many are just, plain, boring, repetitive and completely uninspiring. Plexiq\nshould be Swiss, not German, d Eddie\nRocket From The Crypt - Break It Up\nVery middle of the road. Sort of walking along the same\nway as Status Quo. Doesn't appeal to me but if you like\nyour stuff a bit heavier than indie music then you could\ndo a lot worse.\nAlabama 3 - Converted\nAny single that has a 'perverted' and a 'missionary\nposition' mix has to be worth a listen. It's a guy singing\nabout going to church. Actually if it wasn't for the\nwords this might even be able to transform itself into\na half decent single.\nCable - Arthur Walker\nRun of the mill indie song with a not very catchy cho-rus. Let's hope they don't give up their day jobs. Same\nold story down Indie Street.\nSalanko - The Midnight Radiates A Purple Glow In His\nWorld/Go On Then Enlighten Me\nMellow toons which are very summery. Reminds me of\npicnics in the sun. Both songs on this double a side are\nfloral and hippie. Peace man!\nThe Jon Spencer Blues Explosion - Magical Colors\nSay hello to the trying and failing new Roy Orbison.\nAgain, a seventies flash back. Not really my cup of Earl\nGrey.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON Ash - Wild Surf\nSounds a lot like That Thing You Do by The Wonders.\nYou know, the one written by Tom Hanks. Has the Ash\ntouch - lots of guitars - with tons of melodious har-monies. Heavy rotation on the MTV loop. Destined to\ndo well.\nSnow Patrol - Absolute Gravity\nInteresting single-triple A side with no B's. Very chilled\nout indie music. Snow Patrol were definitely coming\ndown when they thought this one up. Don't listen to\nthis if you're depressed.\nLebanese Blonde - Thievery Corporation\nLove the sitar sample! Apart from that all you've got is\na drum beat and some woman singing in sultry tones.\nGood if you're Lebanese. I suppose.\nNine Yards - Loneliness Is Gone\nVirgin yet again have picked up more potential, commercial talent. Very promising R'n' B tune. Check out'I ha\nBomb in Felix 1126 for a more in-depth look at these\nboys from Peckham.\nBeverly Knight - Slsta Slsta\nYou get what you expect I 'rom Beverly Knight - chill out\nsoul music, fantastic vocals with a catchy beat.\nThe Rottentrolls - The Rottentrolls March\nApollo 440 meets kiddie tv show. Following in the\ntrend of teletubbies but lacks what it takes to be any\ngood. 131\nHelen\n\n"

    "content": "1 2\nBooks 23 November 1998\nFilth\nIrvine Welsh\nJonathan Cape\nRarely does the title of a book so\naptly describe its content. This\nbook, the most recent offering\nfrom Irvine Welsh of Trainspotting' fame,\nis without doubt, one of the most offensive that you'll ever read - unless all of the\nmorals and ideals of society are completely alien to you.\nEssentially, the author uses the main\ncharacter. Bruce Robertson, as a vehicle\nto put into print some of the most racist,\nsexist, big go ted and egotistical ideas that\nhave ever passed the censor's pen. It is\n'Filth' in the sense of what is written,\nand then there is the double meaning,\nrefer ing to the Police. Whilst they are normally undeserving of this title, in the\ncase of Bruce and his colleagues, it is\nmore than apt.\nBut then why is this book on the\n'best seller's' list, lining shelves in W Ft\nSmiths up and down the count ty as an\n'essential buy'? The fact is, this book is\nNOT trash. The skills of the author are\nclearly demonstrated by his ability to capture the dialect of Edinburgh (beware any\none who speaks English as a second language - if you can wade through the\nRemote Control\nAndy McNab\nCorgi Books\nft t f PW..... \u201e\nT his is an above average page-turner\nabout an ex-SAS soldier now working for British Intelligence on den i able operations. He becomes involved in\na formulaic 'one man against thc system'\nchase across thc USA. The hero has a the\nstandard incompetent heroine alonside,\nslowing down his progress. Thc twist is\nthat, in this case, the girl really is one -the seven-year-old daughter of a mur-speech and the rhyming slang without\npause for thought, you deserve a medal).\nOn top of that, he manages to deal with\nthe topics that he docs, without making\nthe reader just give up in disgust.\nThe plot follows, for a relatively brief\nperiod, the life of Bruce Robertson, self-proclaimed 'model policeman' of the\nfot hi an force. A murder, suspected to be\nracially motivated, has been committed,\nand Bruce is appointed to oversee the\ninvestigation, which is particularly sensitive given that the victim was the son of\na diplomat. It does not seem to occur to\nanyone else that Bruce's racist outlook on\nlife may hinder the investigation. At the\nsame time, a promotion is on the cards\nfor Bruce or one of his colleagues, and\nvery quickly, the investigation becomes\na test to see if Bruce is worthy and capable of the post. Bruce however, does not\nprior it is e things as one might expect.\nHis commitment to thc investigation is\nlacking, not least because he resents\nthe fact that Amanda Drummond ('she's nae been polis') is on the team and,\nalso, he cannot see much wrong in the\nmurder of a foreigner (as anyone not of\nde red ex-colleague.\nAs you might expect, the book is\nhigh on non-stop action and fairly low on\ncharacter. I got the Impression that the\nnovel had almost been written as an\nembryonic film script, since certain\nepisodes are described in slow motion.\nThere were fewer SAS trade secrets than\nI had hoped foe presumably the writer\nused them all up in his earlier non-fiction\nworks (Andy McNab, himself a veteran of\nthe Gulf War, recorded his experiences\nin the best-selling Bravo Two Zero and\nImmediate Action).\nHowever, what I will remember most\nabout this book arc the amazing textual\nerrors by McNab and his editor. Three\npassages, relating to some of the leading char act ets, occur in the prologue\nand are repeated word-for-word in the\nfirst chapter. Indicative perhaps of an\nauthor who, while admittedly mastering\nall the functions of a Dragunov sniper\nrifle, doesn't know thc difference\nbetween the 'move' and 'copy' keys on\nhis word processor.\nSimon\nScottish decent is in his eyes). Instead, he\nuses his time to drink, cat and to work\nout schemes to discredit and destroy\nany potential rivals... and to sleep with\nas many women as he can - Bruce considers himself a stud, and no one is\ngoing to keep him from fulfilling that role\n... except maybe his rash. Then there is\nthe trip to Amsterdam, the phone calls,\nBunty, Claire and the wig, but I 've said\ntoo much already.\nOne thing is for sure -1 never wanted\nto put the book down until I got to the\nlast page. At first, I simply had to see what\nhappened to Bruce in the end. The way\nthat he uses every one that he meets,\neven his 'friends' whom he steers\ntowards self destruction, believing that\nhe is better than the rest, made an indescribable hatred of him develop in my\nmind. And things just kept going from\nbad to worse.\nThen the end of the book came,\nand I was poised for the ritual sacrifice of\nBruce as a fitting end to this sad person's life. But the tables turned. Suddenly,\nthings appear in a different light. Why is\nBruce like he is? All at once, you feel sorry\nfor the man, and desperately want him\nto sort his life out and, somehow, pull\nthrough.\nOne of the most commendable\naspects of the book is the way that the\nauthor combines a plot that evokes two\ncontrasting emotions for the main character in such a plausible way. But of\ncourse, you have to believe that a worm\ncan think, philo soph is e and understand!\nYou really should read this book. Buy it\nas a Christmas present - you'll read it so\nquickly that it will still be in a decent\nstate to give someone else (preferably\nnot to a grandparent), saving yourself\n\u00a39.99!\nSJB\nTHUR S.26 TH NOV.59.00 PM "

    "content": "14 Arts 23 November 1998\nDIE YOUNG STAY PRETTY ICA\nT his is an exhibition of brand new art\nbrought to thc Institute of Contemporary Arts by the curator Martin Maloney. Twelve influential artists\nhave come together here to create some\nvery visually strong work. They draw inspiration from 60s and 70s modern art, at\nthe same time conveying their own\nvision. Dexter Dalwood's paintings are\namazingly colourful, very bright and dangerously close to looking a bit over the\ntop. I le manages to strike the right balance between old themes, like Sharon\nTate's, house, and other more futuristic\naspects of architecture seen in his Laboratoire Gamier piece. Jane Brennan also\npaints, only her works are very small representations of flowers, beads and birds.\nIt's very sweet but quite difficult to appreciate although she does have a funny\ntouch; she paints on the sides of wooden\nrectangles. Steven Gontarski makes\nsome very bizarre and exciting sculptures out of synthetic hair and PVC, creating figures that seem to be right out of\nsome sci-fi novel [Wife, pictured left).\nOther interesting features in the\nexhibition include\nsome painted\nresin animals\nscattered all over\nthe gallery,\nRaedecker's empty landscapes that on\ncloser inspection\nhave a strong\nimpact, and Gary\nWebb's very\nclever sculptures,\nalso combining\nthe spirit of the\n70s with the futuristic look of the\n90s, using different materials\nincluding latex\nand some beautiful colours. Finally, the\nlast painting in the gallery is by Martin\nMaloney himself: a hilarious work called\nhey good looking based on Poussin's choice of Hercules. Two women are\nadmiring this young man who is very\nskinny and amazingly un sexy. Perhaps\nMaloney is opposing the image of the\nideal 90s man to the old clich e of the\nstrong and protective being.\nThe exhibition is very enjoyable and\nmiles away from thc hype of last year's Sensation show at the Royal Academy.\nHere, there is no provocation or intention\nof shocking. It feels like art at its simplest,\nas a mode of expression. But the work\non show also has meaning and tackles\nlots of interesting issues like our fear of\nthe fu tut e. Most\nof it is very inventive, often taking\nold material or\nideas and just\ninjecting new life\ninto them. The\nvisual side is also\nvery striking -all\nthe pieces have a very distinctive\ncharacter and\nthey do have a strong pull. You\nautomatically stop\nto look at every-thing. Several\ninterviews with\nthe artists are also\ndisplayed in thc\ncorridor leading to thc bar. They try to\nexplain their art a little, giving a few indications on where they get their ideas\nfrom and how they decide which are\ngoing to be used in their work. This presentation is a rare and very interesting\ninsight into an artist's life and inspiration.\nThe ICA has once again put on a brilliant show, rightly shying away from con-t rovers y, concentrating instead solely on\nthe quality and impact of the artists. They\nhave all the space they need and it is\nrefreshing to see such an exhibition\nwithin these walls. If you have never\nbeen to the ICA, then this is the perfect\nopportunity to go and check it out for\nyourself.\nD.

Courtyard Theatre\nT he Industrial Revolution was a not\na good time for manual labourers.\nAutomatic looms, steam engines\nand farming machinery removed the\ndependency of agriculture and industry\non human hands, and consequently\ncaused great-hardship for these redundant workers. The landowners and industrialists who had pt c vio us ly employed\nvast numbers of-men saw their own fortunes expand massively and were, with\na few honourable exceptions, motivated\nput c ly by the balance sheet and untroubled by the social upheaval they had\ncaused.\nThe First World War was the first total\narmed conflict that Europe had ever\nexperienced, and it demonstrated that in\nthe absence of any clear technological or\ngeographical advantage the victor would\nbe the country with the most lives to\nexpend.\nWorking in 1920, the Czech writer\nKarel Capek combined these two concepts and introduced a third - automated labour. Of course, this is a bit of\na mouthful and not overly exciting, so\nCapek took the Slav word for serfs - rob-ota - and gave the world robots. If you're\nan early 20th century Minister of War,\nmerchant banker or factory owner, you\nlike the sound of these robots. They\ndon't need sub sidi sed social clubs, the\nmanufacturers only require a one-off\ncapital payment instead of monthly\nwages fot human workers and if a machine gun mows them down it's no\nbig deal. This is great, until the manufacturers give them too much intelligence and the robots decide they're\nbetter off without us.\nSo it's a standard 'technology can\nrebound on us in unexpected ways' plot\ndevice. This can work well, but only if the\nideas manifested in the plot are clearly\narticulated with a viable scenario given\nthe circumstances. Sadly, with R.U.R. this\nisn't always the case - especially in the\nfinal scene, which attempts to suggest,\nagainst incontrovertible evidence, that\nsome good can come of the situation.\nThe act ots are all members of the\nCourt Theattc Ttaining Company, and\nconsequently the overall quality is not\nthat of the West t nd. The crowded first\nhalf suffers from the small size of the theatre - Eric Morrison's arrogant Harry\nDomin needs a significantly larger space\nin which to declaim and strut. Gemma\nBarnctson's Lady Helen Glory suffers\nfrom an excess of bleeding heart, but thc\nportrayal of her intellectual vapidity suf-fc rsf tom thc actress' inability to convincingly portray strong conviction or\nemotion.\nIhe first half drifts somewhat, and\nthere is no air of suspense at what should\nbe a climatic final scene before thc inter-val. In fact, it was handled so matter-of-fact ly by the cast that I wasn't even sure\nif there was going to be a second half.\nHowever, this is where it all changes. The\nmain character fot most of the second\nhalf is Construction Engineer Alquist,\nplayed by jon nic Barnetson. This man sin-g le handedly takes R.U.R. and transforms\nit from an interesting production to an\narresting performance. I'm not going to\nspoil the plot by telling you the exact circumstances that force Alquist into thc\nlimelight, but his portrayal of an emotionally starved and half-crazed prisoner\nasked to perform beyond his capabilities\nis utterly convincing.\nR.U.R. is an enjoyable evening of\naccessible entertainment with a strong\nconclusion, and while the quality is not\nthat of the West End, neither are thc\nticket prices; on Sundays you pay what\nyou feel you can afford.\nt tienne Pollard\nUntil 6th December\nNearest tube-.

    "content": "23\nNovember\n1998\nof issue\n1127\nKEEP THE CAT FREE EST. 1949\nThe Students' Newspaper at Imperial College College Beit Back\nDespite promises of additional space\nwhen Beit Quad is renovated which span\nat least the last two years, the Union discovered last week that its net gains from\nthe development could be virtually zero.\nAt a meeting held on 12 November,\nCollege's latest design proposals were\nunveiled by the architects behind the\nproject. Under these plans, the Union will\ngain the basements in the west wing of\nthe Quad, but it will lose several areas on\nits East and West staircases - including the\nDramsoc workshop, bar manager's flat\nand dressing rooms-and all of the space\ncurrently occupied in the South basement - primarily the ICSE library.\nAlthough the West Wing basements\ncould in theory provide homes for all\nthese needs, they are already earmarked\nfor, amongst others, Felix and IC Radiowho both stand to become homeless in\nBy David Roberts\nthe next few years. Furthermore, work on\nthe Quad redevelopment will start at the\nbeginning of next July, and the Union will\nonly be allowed to start work on renovating the basements a year later. Clearly,\nspace is going to come at a very high premium next year - indeed as it stands\nFelix could find itself relocated to Portacabins come next Summer.\nAll this, however, comes in the wake\nof a promise to dramatically increase\nUnion space. In a report dated July 1996,\nthe Rector's Committee on Social &\nRecreational Space recommended that\n\"When Biology move from Beit to BMS,\nthe IC Union should occupy the basements of the East and West sides of the\nBeit Quadrangle\" (the Union had already\nbeen promised some of the South base-ment s). This recommendation came in\nthe wake of figures compiled by College\nwhich showed that social space at South\nKen represents approximately half that\nrecommended by the funding council.\nYet, in their own words, \"for the College\nto have good social and recreational facilities is likely to be a factor in attracting\ngood applicants.\" Clearly, adequate\nUnion provision makes commercial\nsense.\nAs a result of this assurance, the\nUnion has planned for two years to utilise\nthis new space - indeed the forthcoming\nrelocation of Union media to the West\nWing allowed this Summer's dB's expansion to take place.\nNonetheless, the group steering the\nproject remain adamant that in order for\nthe business plan to \"work\" the Union\ncannot have any more space. Instead,\ntheir plans include space for a grand\ntotal of 363 beds - of which, somewhat\nsuspiciously, only 309 will be occupied by\nstudents. Of the 263 rooms, 102 will be\nen-suite singles, and there is also projected space for couples and perhaps\neven children.\nThis will produce what the design\nreport describes as \"a mix of accommodation favourable for conference/holi-day letting purposes.\" Indeed this drive\nfor top class conference facilities (the\ndriving force behind many recent building projects) looks like producing what\nhas been described as \"luxury accommodation\" which raises the question:\nHow much are students going to be\nasked to pay?\nMarching for More Money\nBy Ed Sexton\nA Socialist Worker demonstration against\ntuition fees was held in London last\nWednesday. The protesters, mostly stu-dents, marched from the University of\nLondon Union to Hyde Park causing\nmany of the West End's central routes to\nbe closed for the afternoon.\nSeveral thousand protesters left ULU\nat around 1pm in good spirits, braving\nthe cold November air and the threat of\nrain. Universities from around the UK\nwere represented, as well as members of\nSocialist Worker and other followers of\nthe socialist movement, the march proceeded slowly, shouting various slogans\nthrough London, including \"Fight! Fight!\nFight! Tuition fees are shite!\", \"They say\ncut back - we say fight back!\" and \"What\ndo we want? Free education! When do\nwe want it? Now!\" The demonstrators\nsat down in the street on several occasions, even starting a rendition of 'Sit\nDown' in Welbeck Street. Shopkeepers\nand the business community came out\nof their offices, curious as to what was\ngoing on, with one suit-clad bystander\ncommenting \"all this for bloody stu-dents.\" In Orchard Street, a centre for\nLondon's commercial sector, the chants\nThe demonstration\nbecame more political; \"Tuition fees -no way! Tax the rich, make them pay!\"\nAs the march continued down Oxford\nStreet, approaching Speaker's Corner,\nChristmas shoppers were treated to\nrepeated cries of \"Up yours' lon y!\" and\n\"You can stuff tuition fees up your arse\".\nIn the Park the crowd was addressed\nby the organisers and then by Tony Benn\nMP, who gave his support to the campaign for free education. \"The right to\neducation is a basic human right\" he\nargued, before criticising current gov-Photos: David Roberts\nern ment policy on education and the\nwelfare state. \"How long will it be before\nyou have to have a loan to go to school?\"\nhe asked. Attacking the National Union\nof Students' lack of action on the matter,\nhe jibed that the campaign would be\nhelped \"if you can convert the NUS to\nfight for students.\" He urged students to\njoin with other groups fighting cutbacks\nin the welfare state, such as widowed\npensioners and disabled persons, ending\nwith an optimistic shout of \"We're going\nto win this campaign!\"\nInside..m Cartoon 4\nLetters 6\nEditorial 7\nColumns 8\nScience 10\nIC Radio 11\nBooks 12\nArts 14\nMusic 16\nClubbing 20\nFilm 22\nComputer Games 24\nSport 26\nDiversions 27\nCrossword 28\n\n"

    "content": "23 November 1998 Books 13\nThe Right Man\nNigel Planer\nIf this book were obtained under normal circumstances, it would be either:\na) thrown under my bed and forgotten about until the library wrote a letter\nof complaint, or b) thrown under my bed\nand forgotten about until I realised it was\nUncle Gerald's birthday the coming Tuesday (the ideal opportunity to get rid of\nunwanted or extremely boring books).\nTwenty-two pages of it were just\nabout the limit for any sane mind. However, I had unfortunately agreed to write\na review of this novel; therefore custom\ndictated that I tried to read as much of\nit as humanly possible. So another 198\npages later, did my opinion of the book\nchange? Yes. It was still boring, but now\nI found it incredibly irritating as well.\nThe book is written in the first person by the character Guy Mullins, who\nis a married father of one with his own\ntheatrical agency. At the beginning of\nthe story he discovers that his wife is having an affair, so he moves out. This\nmore or less seems to be the only event\nin the entire book, despite the various\ngroup therapy sessions and suchlike that\nGuy attends, and the subplots involving\nclients of the agency and Guy's family.\nThis is due to the very bland, flat way in\nwhich the narrative is constructed - Guy\nseems to have no emotional ups or\ndowns whatsoever, and treats each area\nof his life in more or less the same way.\nSo there we have the boring. Now\nwe come to the irritating. As some of\nyou may no doubt know, the author of\nthis book, Nigel Planer, once starred in\na rather popular comedy television pro-gram me, The Young Ones. This is his first\nnovel. In the programmes, one of the\ncharacters in the aforementioned subplots is supposedly a well known TV personality who is writing his first novel,\ninterestingly entitled The Right Man.\nThis, and other similar tendencies (such\nas saying \"I'm sure you remember the\nlast film XXX [a random client of the theatrical agency] was in so and so...\") generally makes you feel like screaming at\nthe wall (or whoever) and having a nervous breakdown. At least they had that\neffect on me.\nDespite all these, I have to admit\nthat the book did contain the odd\nmoment of light relief. Unfortunately, I don't think they were intentional, lor\nexample, one section of a chapter\nbizarrely ends with the sentences \"I got\nup and fetched the Yellow Pages. I could-n't stand it in the office any longer.\"\nEven more peculiarly, the next paragraph sees Guy visiting a prostitute. I had\nno idea that the Yellow Pages had\nexpanded its range so much. If I were\nyou, I would nip out and obtain a copy\nfor your next holiday reading. They\nwould be a far better read than this\nnovel.\nRebecca Tupper\nBoardersnakes\nJames Crumley\nFlamingo\nBorder snakes revolves around the\nexperiences of two middle-aged\nguys who both share a common\npurpose. Revenge. The first of the two\nthat you meet has just stepped out of jail\nafter having spent the last ten years of\nhis life in there. His name, Milodragovitch, gives away his Russian heritage\nbut his friends have it easier and get to\ncall him Milo for short. Ihe story behind\nhis lust for revenge is that he had been\nscammed out of his substantial inheritance and understandably he was not\nhappy. Sughrue is the other half in this\ndouble act and is determined to find the\npeople who gut shot him and left him\non the b tink of death.\nYou are taken on the road around\nthe border between Texas and Mexico\nwith a small detour via LA as Milo and\nSughrue investigate, in their own way,\nthe scant evidence at their disposal.\nHold onto your seats as you are about\nto be taken on an action packed,\ncocaine fuelled and sublimely intricate\nadventure that is certainly worthy of film\nmaterial. Especially effective is the interchanging of the two characters. The first\npart of the book is written from the perspective of Milo, bolder and more of a chance r than his buddy, and Sughrue's perspective is alternated every few chap-ter s. This sort of book is easily film mate-rial, and if a film like 'tear And Loathing\nlin Las Vegas' can do well then this book\n.which is on a similar theme, ie. two guys\non the road loaded with numerous\ndrugs, will probably be coming to your\ncinema screens as a major motion picture any day now.\nJason\nHabitus\nJames Flint\nFourth Estate\nPerhaps you shouldn't judge a book\nby its front cover, but the back\noften makes illuminating reading.\nThe edition I reviewed is in paperback,\nwhich should mean that all the proper literary critics of this world have already\nhad the chance to pass judgement on\nthe hardback edition of James flint's Habitus. The usual form is then to plaster the back of the paperback edition\nwith glowing recommendations from\ngushing Sunday broadsheets, and if possible a respected author writing in the\nsame genre. While your reviewer is not\nin the habit of slavishly following the\nmores of the lit. crit. establishment, it is\nhelpful to glance at the back cover\nbefore beginning, in order to get some\nidea of what you're about to wade\nthrough. Sadly, however, the paperback\nand hardback editions seem to have\ncame out simultaneously. Oh dear. I'm already starting to forebode.\nFlint has obviously read widely, but\nsadly he doesn't seem to have understood how a novel works. A decent plot\nis often helpful, especially if you're trying\nto churn out an epic, while one-dimensional characters are a burden if the plot\nis lacking. One of these characters is\nLaika, the dog that the Soviet Union sent\ninto space in 1957. Defying every law of\nphysics, this dog survives by \"drawing\nsustenance from the barrage of media\nthat encases the planet\".

    "content": "16 Music 23 November 1998\nAUDIOWEB\nFireworks City\nESSEN\nKing Size Blues\nI'm sorry, mate, but those\nshades are ridiculous.\nAudio web arc one of those difficult to categorise bands that\nemerged after the Britpop\nexplosion ran out of fuel and dwindled\ninto happy memories of Blur versus\nOasis hysteria. They have always found\nthemselves a couple of steps behind\nthe limelight drifting around in the\nshadows of larger more successful acts\nsuch as the Verve and Radiohead. Now\nwith their second album they hope to\ngain a foothold on the ladder to the big\ntime, which they didn't achieve with\nthe first attempt.\nThe first track off the album, also the\nfirst single lifted from it, Policeman Skank,\ngets you into the right mood immediately with Just the right amount of\nenergy. The following track, Test the Theory continues this trend with Martin's rag ga vocals lifting this song from a pretty drab semi-funky rock out to a more in yer face effort. Shame he only\nstarts on the rag ga tip at the end of the\ntrack - it could have done with it a lot earlier on.\nAudioweb seem to be very keen on\nattempting to write epics, and let me\nstress that they are attempting to do\nthis. Firstly you have the failed attempt\nwith previous single Personal Feeling\nfollowed immediately by 77y which also\nt ties to be an epic but lacks that certain\nedge which makes an epic so catchy and\nuplifting. Don't assume that the whole\nalbum is full of dire tracks because you\nwould be completely mistaken - there\nare moments of brilliance with tracks\nsuch as Sentiments For a Reason and the\nbeautiful Control which has to be the\nnext single - I'd be willing to place most\nof my money on that.\nTrip hop rears its head on Freefall (it\ncrops up all over the place nowadays)\nand seems to just trudge along with the\nobligatory strings included to produce\nthat epic effect yet again.\nTo sum up I have two questions for\nyou. One - how can a lead singer who\ncould make you brick your pants if you\nmet him in some dark alley have such a beautiful voice? And two - how can they\nwrite such beautiful ballads like Control\nand at the same time write pretty average plod along s? Overall the album\nsounds as though it has been rushed\nand Audioweb were told to get an album\nout in November. Maybe they should\nhave changed the album name and\ngiven themselves that little bit of extra\ntime. H Jason\ns sen are oh\nof bands or\ncould c area's New A< time. (\na reason tc\nlinking\nver on\n.rise v ou.I also\nSUPER FURRY ANIMALS\nOut Spaced (Selected B Sides & Rarities 94-98)\nIf you're happy and\nyou know It, close\nyour mouth\nO ut Spaced is a slightly weird, but definitely\nwonderful tour through the Super Furry back\ncatalogue, none of which have featured on\nthe two albums - Fuzzy Logic and Radiator. Four tracks\nare from the In Space and The Moog Droog EPs that\nwere released on the Welsh Indie label Ankst, prior to\nthe Furries signing to the Creation record label in\n1996. Subsequently all Furry singles have had English\ntitle tracks with the B sides predominantly in Welsh,\nhence the majority of the tracks on this CD are in\nWelsh. Language should be no barrier, as the ability to\nsuccessfully experiment with so many different styles\nis something \"that sets the furries apart from many\nother bands\nThe tracks, which are probably most familiar to the\naverage punter are The Man Don't Give a Fuck and\nSmokin', the latter coming from the recent EP entitled\nIce I locke yI lair. The Man Don't Give a Fuck is the opening track here - it starts gently but then unleashes into\nthe chant-like phrase which has become the standard\n(and very popular) Furry encore at live gigs. It's just the\nsort of adrenal in rush that is sadly missing from the large\namount of British bands that are floating about the live\ncircuit nowadays. It's tracks and bands like these that\nrestore faith in the musical system by inspiring a new\ngeneration to stand up, grab a guitar and make themselves heard.\nGuacamole (even though it has nothing to do with\na Mexican dip) is amo shing/ rock 'n' roll influenced\ntrack with vocalist Gruff giving an excellent, Great Balls\nof Fire impression on the chorus. Focus Pocus borders\ninto the realms of progressive rock with hammond\norgan and flute-like solo bits in the intro but even this\nis tastefully done.\nThe Furries' origins as a techno outfit shine through\nonly slightly in the ambient style of some of the tracks\nbut particularly on Dim Brys Dim Chwys and ArnoFio/Glo\nin the Dark. There are several tracks thrown in which\nare in an easy listening vein. These nicely compliment\nthe tracks around them but would also stand well on\ntheir own. In particular, Don't be a fool, Billy and Carry\nthe Can show the furries laid-back side at their best.\nThis CD shows the Furries at their most diverse yet,\nbut this definitely isn't the case of bundling together a load of album rejects. If they do have some rope y material in the back catalogue, then they've kept it well hid-den, f hey still aren't the household name that they\ndeserve to be, but this is probably due to their refusal\nto stick to one tried and tested formula. If you haven't listened to much of them before, this really Is an excellent place to start. For the already converted, things just\ngot better. CI\nKatherine\n\n"

    "content": "23 November 1998\nMINISTRY OF SOUND\nThe Annual IV\nMinistry of Sound.\nCan you not read?\nJudge Jules is in charge of mixing CD1. It kicks off\nwith David Morales' presenting The Face and\nNeedin' IS. I never heard this Original Mistake version before; somehow I always seem to hear the full-on\nremixes. If you know this one then you're gonna love\nthe slow intro building up to the smash - it just teases\nso much, and then he lets you have it - classic! A faultless mix takes us into Ultra Nate and Found A Cure. I'm sure you all know the follow up to the chart hit Freestill sounds so fresh. Bini & Martini's Dancin' With You\nquickly passes by, as does the eighties-sound of Joey\nNegro featuring Taka Boom with Can't Get High\nWithout You. They do nothing at all for the mix.\nJose-Nunez feat u ting Octahvia did a good round in\nthe clubs with In My Life. Again, this full on vocal mix is\none that I haven't heard before. Sounds just as good\nwithout the vocals though. The Don's Horn Song is a thumping tune but without life. But Blockster and You\nShould Be seems even more of an anti-climax! I just\ncouldn't wait for Take Controlby State of Mind. The M&S production shines through and the vocals just drive you\ninsane. The beats are all there. Curse the Judge for only\nplaying four minutes of it!\nThen, there's The Tamperer featuring Maya tampering with'Michael Jackson's Feel It. I'm not going to\nsay anything about this one apart from that I think she'll\nlook ra the t stupid with a chimney on her! The Golden\nGirls did well with Kinetic and they still do. to ve the electronics on this one. You can probably see a trend here;\nsome good tracks then some bad, and then some good\nones again.\nJules concludes his mix with Blue Adonis' Discocop.\nIt's as party-funky as it gets on a house compilation, allowing Boy George to take to the turntables. The old Boy\nstarts with fatboy Slim's Rockafeller Skank; say no more.\nI le cuts this one up to spin Run DMC vs Jason Nevins.\nI'm sure you know what It's Like..., and who wins. Sau\nPaulo (Be Yourself Be Free) and Baby Bumps (Burnin')\nsound so used by now. These are definitely not some\nof the better tracks of this year. Juliet Roberts' / Like is\nhardly house music - the vocals are given too much\nemphasis and just destroys the track. Since we're talking vocals, you must hear the helium voices on Thinkin'\nAbout Me by The MPC's. It's hilarious, and shouldn't be\nhere at all. Fortunately Mousse T saves us with Horny and\nhis master production. And there's more in the form of\nCevin Fisher and The Freaks Come Out.\nThe overall choice of tracks was better done by Boy\nGeorge. They may not be all wicked but we don't hear\nno pants. Some of the better tracks are from Ruff Driverz\nShame, Furry Phreaks featuring Deva Soothe, Lovestation\nTeardrop and the unmistakable Freestylers with B Boy\nStance -so rough and chill in', and that Oasis sample without permission. Interestingly enough, Georgy boy uses\nFatboy again with Gangsta Trippin'. Maybe he just put\nthis in to show he can mix this out to The All Seeing I( Beat Goes On), and he does so most impressively. The\nJungle Brothers scratch in and Jungle Brother spins to an\nend.\nThe Annual is always a competition between the two\nDJs and Boy George wins easily. I le ain't MoS resident\nfor nothing! In conclusion, The Annual is a decent com-pila tion, but the tracks that I really like I already have so\nI wouldnt go out and pay sixteen odd quid for this. Of\ncourse, if you don't have ' them or you're just a fan of\nMoS material, then buy it before the limited edition packaging sells out. El\nAsad\nTHE PSYCHONAUTS\nTime Machine \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nT ime Machine is a retrospective\nmix album from those demonic\ndeck ster s the Psychonauts.\nFeaturing various Mo'Wax Dj's and\nmusicians such as DJ Shadow, DJ Krush,\nUnkle and Money Mark this album aims\nto ease a new Mo'Wax convert into the\nlabel's hallowed halls of massive beats\nand wicked cuts.\nIt comes as no surprise then that this\nalbum is a mixed bag. There are classics\nand previously unheard tunes all in varying lengths. The Psychonauts let some\ntracks play out and only give tant a lising glimpses of others - the old Mo'Wax\nfavourite of inter playing weird 50's retro\nstyle samples of earnest voices talking\nabout the 'Solar System' with thumping\npercussion and heavenly, tuneful guest\nvocalists.\nThe mixing skills on display on this\nrecord are just insane - switching\nbetween mul it ple records and samples\nwith dizzying speed and attention to all\naspects of each separate channel. After\nlistening to this album you feel that al olt of planning has gone into the structure\nand the progression through the tracks.\nThe Psychonauts build the beats up\nonly to knock them down again with a blast of chaos and then its on to the next\ntrack - with another Mo'Wax classic with\na twist, if you are not ready for a lot of\nvariety in your beats don't buy this album\n- you get the lot here - from african\ndrums, to kazoos, to washboards and\nsome foot stomping too.\nThe best bits of the album were the\n(fairly frequent) parts where the Psychonauts got there hands on some DJ\nShadow and Unkle mixes - Rock On (Dj\nShadow) is given a nice twist and my old\nfave Organ Donor (DJ Shadow) starts off\nthe album. The less well known artists\nf tom the Mo'Wax stable don't lie as well\nupon my ears but they do provide an\ninteresting contrast to the mote established sounds of Unkle et al. Basically,\nthis album is all about ry thy m and the\nPsychonauts have it, Mo'Wax has got it\nand they show it all off here. Just be\nready for a big variety to go with your big\nbeats. El\nJoel\nJONNY L Magnetic\nIt has almost been a year since Jonny\nL's highly acclaimed debut album,\nSawtooth, was released on the now\nlegendary Xt label. After a brief period\nof producing material such as Make me\nWork, he was back producing break-beats again, alongside producers such\nas Roni Size and Carl Craig. Back in the\nearly days of d&b, Dj's such as Fabio,\nGrooverider and Bukem didn't really\npay much attention to Mr f's material\nand it wasn't until Piper was released\nlast year-that he gained full respect and\nwas finally regarded as a 'true player'\non the drum and bass scene.\nMs new album, Magnetic, is likely to\nconfirm that he still is a very prominent\nfigure on this scene which is slowly\nbeginning to exhaust itself. I low ever I feel if material like this is anything like\nfuture releases, then d&b will continue\nto be a form of alternative music to listen to. I le has co-produced a few of the\ntracks on this album with other artists,\nsuch as DJ Optical, to create some excellent sounding music. 'Viper', for exam-ple, is a combination of a simple\nbreakbeat and two minimalist ic bass\nlines. Combine this with a perfect intro-duct ion, and you have drum and bass at\nit's best. 'Focus', the fourth track on the\nalbum is a dark, dirty combination of\ndistorted kick drums and muffled snares.\nIt has the most basic of basic bass lines\nand in conjunction with the eerie sam-ple s, it creates yet another brilliant tune\nfrom the man himself.\nI low ever, the first three tracks do not\ndo the album any justice whatsoever,\nbeing monotonous two step beats with\na lack of a melodic bassline. I do, however like the interludes (Hard Clip and\nExabyte), which let you chill out to the\nhalf speed beats before the next portion\nof upfront, unadulterated breaks kick in.\nIn general, I believe the album has\nsome great potential to do well, and it\nmay well be a good time to use the\n'program' function on your CD player to\nenjoy it at it's best. In conclusion, I think\nit would be safe to say Jonny L has come\na long way since busking in Covent Garden with his Roland TB 303. El\nDJ Sianide\n\n"

On Saturday 14th technicians from the Dramatic Society were preparing the lighting\nfor today's 'East meets West' show in the\nnewly refurbished Great Hall. When\nattempting to set up the power supply\nthey discovered the switch for the large\n3-p has c,125 amp socket was spinning\nfreely; as a result the internal safety lock\nmechanism was jammed.\nThe unrelenting team investigated\nfurther, and were astounded to find the\nplug's circuitry completely unearthed,\nleaving the system live. This in conjunction with the fact access holes to the\nwires were left uncovered, presented\nthe possibility of a415V shock for some\npoor unfortunate. The root cause was\nfounds to be the attachment of the external switch to the Internal pin with tape;\na makeshift attempt to remedy highly\ndubious workmanship. The lighting\nexperts then found an adjacent socket to\nbe completely unfused, rendering it use-less, one of the DramSoc members commenting the system was \"blatantly\ndangerous.\"\nThe incident's significance is heightened by the fact the DramSoc were given\nthe go-ahead by the refurbishment's By Andrew Ofori\narchitect, who thought the electrics to be\nsound. The College electrician, who\nassessed the fittings was of a different\nmind. He could only suggest the sockets were work in progress, finding difficulty in believing any electrician would\nThe offending Wires\nleave the sockets in such a state. He profiled the case as a \"Health and Safety risk\"\nThe Great Hall's electrical fittings\nwere installed by contractors, leaving\nsome doubt over who currently bares\nresponsibility. Nick Towers from the\nDrama Society began with Security in his\nquest to establish accountability. He\nwas then referred to the defects hot-line, Estates, yet more electricians and\nfrom there to maintenance who refused\nto get involved with the work as it was\nnot yet 6 months old and consequently\ndid not qualify as a maintenance job. It\nappears the problem is finally being\naddressed by the Supervising Project\nEngineer.\nThe summer's refurbishments seem\nto have turned out well short of the\nresounding success hoped for. with a number of problems surrounding the\ncontroversial installation of manually controlled retractable seating (Felix 1123) as\nwell lighting being attached to fixed\nlength ceiling cables, leaving them completely inaccessible. Problems have\nplagued the project to such an extent\nthat a 'snag' list has been drawn in a concerted effort to resolve the issues.\nPromises of restorative equipment\nhave left the DramSoc quietly confident\nas to the outcome of this recent set-back; things now look hopeful for the\nEast meets West event, although Nick\nTowers warned, \"If we don't get the\npower supplies it's going to be a very\ndark show.\"\nBradshaw Bikes It Winks World Champ\nFlicks Into Action\nBy Patrick Hayes\nOn Tuesday, ICU Labour Society hosted\na speaker meeting with Ben Bradshaw,\nMP for Exeter and a keen and radical\ncampaigner on environmental issues.\nHe impressed many present with his\nhands-on commitment to the cause,\ncycling to the meeting from Parliament,\nthen jumping back onto his bike afterwards to table a question to the Secretary of State for the DETR, deputy Prime\nMinister John Prescott. He spoke briefly\nabout the transport white paper, and\nthe negotiations at the international summit in Kyoto with the aim of reducing carbon dioxide emissions world-wide,\npraising the deputy Prime Minister's work\nthere, and his hopes for the future.\nHe then took questions on a range\nof environmental issues including building on 'brownfield' sites, transport in our\ncities and moves towards integration,\nas well as the strategic rail authority.\nAlthough a motivated and passionate\nenvironmentalist (you'd have to be to voluntarily cycle from Westminster to South\nKen) he accepted that there were many\nother demands on the Government's time in the Queen's Speech, citing in particular Lords reform. He added that with\nthe overwhelmingly lo ry her edit aries out of the frame, Government legislation\ncould be passed much quicker, and pri-or ites such as the strategic rail authority\ncould be addressed.\nThe next speaker meeting is on the\n10th Dec and will feature Mark Leonard\nof Demos; the man who set out to re-brand Britain and modernise the monarchy. ll ll l fill ll lil l!l ll Siit j if is i Ben Bradshaw Photo: Jonas\nBy Andrew Ofori\nAmongst IC's numerous sporting virtues\nlies a world champion who last week\nattempted to defend his crown.

They were an absolute\nbunch of whiners who obviously hadn't played real football before!\nOK, we were a bit worried after\nabout 10 minutes because we hadn't scored, but a lovely lofted ball over their\ndefence fell to yours truly who struck the\nball in the left corner. It was great to\nstart the steamroller moving. To be fair\ntheir defence was crap, but that only\nmade us hungrier for goals.

But leaving aside rigorous science, there are\nother signs that point to the arrival of this\ntemporal milestone. In days gone by\npeople used to look for indications of\nwhat thc future held in the entrails of\ndead animals or the pattern of cracks that\nformed on heating a tortoise's shell over\nan open fire, which sounds bizarre but\nwhich in truth is no worse than watching\nRussell Grant and probably considerably\nmore entertaining.\nSuch a preoccupation with sooth-saying didn't end with the divination of\nthe ancients. Recently it has become\nalmost impossible to turn on the telly or\nopen a newspaper without coming\nacross a 'what does the new millennium\nhold for you' - type feature. In the 1950s and 60s, such articles were a thing of\nsplendour - by the year 2000, manned\nbases would have been built on Mars,\nwhole tracts of the Sahara would have\nbeen reclaimed and turned into the garden of b den, and disease and misery\nwould have been eradicated from the\nface of the tar th. Admittedly, we made\nit to the moon by the year of my birth,\nand I learn from my old friend and sparring partner Simon Baker (aka The Voice\nof Reason) that about fifteen hundred\nsquare feet of the carpark outside of\nWaterstone's is being turned into a cabbage patch for the\ngood of Betty Windsor and the benefit\nof mankind in gen-era l, but other than\nthat we've all fallen\nrather short of the\nsomewhat heady\naspirations of the\nRock and Roll gene r ation. So much so\nthat some months ago a well-known\n'adult' comic reported that the official\n'Year of the Future' has been put back to\n2020 and that flying cars, robot maids\nand hand-held shrinking ray machines\nare now expected to be phased in from\n2035.\nIt'll be interesting to see how clothing manufacturers react to the new mil-lenni um. Opinion is divided on the\nsubject of what the man/woman/imp as sive-fac cd android about town will be\nwearing in the year 2000. If costume\ndesigners for futuristic sci-fi movies from\n1950 onwards are to be believed, we'll\nhave two choices. Option one will resemble a cross between Tudor-style court\nMatt Salter\n'...we've all fallen\nrather short of the\nsomewhat heady as pi rations of the Rock\nand Roll generation...\ncostume and police-issue\nbody armour, a sort of Cardinal Wolscy meets the NYPD SWAT\nteam, complete with flowing capes, soft\nfelt hats and Kevlar exoskeleton - laser-guided cod pieces for the men, bulletproof boob tubes for the women.\nAlternatively we'll all be walking around\nin androgynous one-size-fits-all body\nstockings, possibly with black plastic utility belts and badges-indicating the IVF fermentation broth from which we\noriginated, affixed to our nipples. There\nwill be no fat people as this would cause\nunsightly bulges.\nFor the same rea-son, the male sexual response will\nhave to be bred out\nof the species. What\ncomes as a mild surprise to me is that\nnobody seems to\nhave considered\nthe possibility that\nwe'll continue to\nwear jeans and a Tshirt in the next millennium or that M&S will still be knocking out hideous Fairlsle\ncable-knit sweaters to go with their own-brand Chinos and canvas deck shoes. If\nyou doubt me, try to name a single scifi film in which the characters look like\nanything other than the survivors of the\nBattle of Bosworth Field or cast-offs from\na Jane Fonda 'Shake\nUp and Dance' fitness video.\nHaving spent a small fortune in the\nJanuary sales this year\n(although not on\ncable-knit sweaters I can assure you), the\nnews that I 'll have to\nhave a complete\nchange of wardrobe in about 14 months\nhas come as a rather unwelcome sur-p rise, although Oxfam are going to have\na field day. However, I doubt that I'm alone in being perturbed by this impending radical shake-up in sartorial behaviour. The loss of traditional fashion lines\nwill mean that high street retailers will be\nhard pushed to retain their distinctive\nbrand images, particularly if the unisex\nbody stocking option, gets thc nod. I foresee major job losses in thc budget\nretailing sector in this event, although\neradicating the male sexual response\nseems a small price to pay for getting\nshot of Cromwell's Madhouse and Mr\n'...nobody seems to\nhave considered the\npossibility that we'll\ncontinue to wear jeans\nand aT shirt in the next\nmillennium...'\nByrite. Personally I'm hoping that the Tudor noble-man-cum-Noo Yoike cop look wins\nthrough, as I don't think I could get away\nwith a stretch Lycra cat suit and I 've always\nharbour eda secret longing for tights\nand a feathered calfskin cap (this is just\nbetween thc two of us you understand).\nBut as well as looking forward, the\nturn of the century has traditionally been\na time to look back and prepare an end-of-era report on the previous hundred\nyears. The recent profusion of 'Top 100...'\ntype listings in the seemingly boundless\nglossy magazine\nmarket serves to\nconfirm that the\ntrend is still alive\nand well. Maybe it's just me, but for a century that started\nwith thc Boer War,\nmoved smartly\nthrough World War I and II, took 5 years\noff before starting\non Korea, then without so much as a pause for breath,\nmarched on to Vietnam for a10 year\nstop-over whilst simultaneously spawning\nbloody conflagrations in the Middle East,\nCentral America, Afghanistan and thc\nFalklands before returning to Lurope,\nthe home of warfare, for a local derby in\nYugoslavia (refereed in expertly by the\nUN) which has already\ngone into overtime and\nmay yet have to be\ndecided on penalties;\nnominations for 'Best\nWar 1900-2000' have\nbeen remarkably thin on\nthe ground.\nWhilst 'Best War' is\nby far thc most coveted\naward, there are dozens\nof others up for grabs: 'Best Civil War',\n'Best Regional Skirmish', 'Best Supporting\nArmy', 'Best Directed Battle', 'Best Popular\nInsurrection', 'Best Use of Pathogenic\nDefoliant in a Jungle Campaign', 'Most\nFlagrant Violation of the Geneva Convention', 'Most Inhumane Use of Lethal\nForce as an Organ of National Foreign\nPolicy' - thc list is endless. Competition\nfor the much sought-after prize for 'Most\nMurderous Dictator' is expected to be\nespecially fierce, with Hitler, Stalin and Pol\nPot amongst the favourites at this stage.\nThe closely related award for 'Ruthless\nDictator Most Resembling a1940s Scat\nSinger' is likely to go to former Chilean\ntyrant General Pinochet for his startlingly\nrealistic impression of Cab Calloway. It is\nrumoured that the General is even now\nbelieved to be considering calling Minnie the Moocher as a character witness\nin his forthcoming extradition hearings.\nAs always, the identity of the winner of\nthc prestigious 'Kim Philby Award for\nEspionage and High Treason' is, for obvious reasons, a closely guarded secret.\nAbout the only thing known for sure is\nthat the successful nominee will not be\npresent to collect their prize in person.\nAs expected, the 'Lifetime Award for\nBringing the World to the Brink of\nArmageddon' looks like being a straight\nfight between NATO and the Warsaw\nPact. The only bright spot is the cancellation of the award fot 'Most! h in ly Veiled\nAdvancement of the Cold War in the\nGuise of International Peacekeeping'\n(past recipients of which include the CIA,\nMI5 and thc KGB), due to lack of inter-est.\nI'm not being flippant. Out lives,\nthose of our parents and our parents'\nparents can be charted by what all-star\ncast was packing them in at which Theatre of War at the time. Understandably\nhowever, we prefer to overlook this\nrather un savoury aspect of the 20th Century and compile lists of positive things\nthat have happened within living mem-or y. Most interesting of the genre for me\nwas a Best 1000 Pop and Rock Albums of\nAll Time book put out recently by a publishing house run by a latter day Phileas Fogg.\nI was delighted to find\nthat of the top 5 albums\n-which is as far as I got\nbefore being chased\nout of Dillons by an\nirate shop assistant - a fab four of them were\nby the Beatles. To my\ngreat satisfaction (but\nnot to that of the Rolling Stones - they\nwere well down the list), my personal all\ntime favourite album Revolver was no 1\nwith Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts\nClub Band and The Beatles (aka The\nWhite Album) coming in at nos 2 and 3.\nThe fads from Liverpool also captured\nfifth place with Abbey Road. Inexplicably,\nthe no 4 spot went to the album Nevermind.\nConsidering all thc great albums\nreleased since Nipper heard His Master's Voice, this strikes me as a surprising\nchoice, but at least it irrevocably clears up\none thing - it was Nirvana that split the\nBeatles. Yoko Ono can finally stand\nabsolved.\n'...nominations for\n'Best War 1900-2000' have been\nremarkably thin on\nthe ground...'\n\n"

People need to see evidence that\ntheir taxes are well spent.\nEconomies in Asia are in turmoil,\nwhile so-called 'underdeveloped' nations\nare being crippled by the burden of\ndebts to World Banks.\nMeanwhile nearer to home students\nare campaigning against tuition fees and\na government whose constant response\nis 'we don't have enough money'.\nConsultancy firms, banks and investment companies are enticing Imperial's finest with offers of high starting salaries\nand regular bonuses. A few decades\nago 'naive' idealism would have made us\nsay \"no - I want to stay in science and\nmake a difference. Sure I 'll get paid\nless, but if it's enough to get by, I'm happy.\" Now it seems all we can see is\npound signs, secure incomes and pension plans. I'm not saying I would be\nhappy living off a PhD grant all my life,\nbut \u00a315k before tax would supply all my\nmaterial needs, even living in London.\nSo why are we increasingly swapping idealism and ambition for pay\ncheques? Do we really believe that\n'money is the means to happiness'? I freely admit that I'm better off than most\nstudents,- I 've spent much of my life surrounded by wealthy friends, and I can\nsafely say money causes more problems\nthan it solves. Just look at the examples\nabove. Would the abolition of money as\nMarx advocated be such a bad thing?\nAnd for those of you applying for jobs\nthis term, just stop briefly and ask yourself if you want the job, or the money.\nHas anyone got any 1120s? On a lighter note, I have a request to\nmake. Would anyone who has a copy of\nthe first Felix of term (issue 1120) which\nthey no longer require please drop it into\nthe office? We seem to have run out of\nspare copies, and could do with a few for\nthe archive. Cheers.
