This clever bit of edu a cation al buffing has killed two birds with one\nstone. It fulfils there promise to encourage more people to go on to further edu aca tion, though in a very poor way. And, although they state it is not intended to\nreplace housing benefits, it does smooth the wake in the trans is ion period. Now\nthey can happily exclaim that the money is there and if your not getting enough\nthen it's the colleges' fault. Pity the poor college administration, for once. Lets\nnot forget who screwed the system up in the first place by bringing in the\nPoll Tax et all. Enough of this rant.

It was envisaged that the event\nwould have caused too many security\nproblems. Because of this Security are\nfooting the bill for the \u00a3180.00 of\nadvertising handouts, staff cards and\nmembership cards.\nThe advertising handouts were being\nfor Dave distributed outside of College to the\ngeneral public from record shops and\nby pavement distribution. Events in the\nUnion Building require that either the\nusers are members of the College\n(students or staff) or that they are\npresent on a formal guest list. It was\nthis problem that prompted Security to\nbar the event.\nDave Cornwall was the Chairman of\nAfro-Caribbean Society, which held a troubled party in the JCR. Allegations\nof mugging and drug pushing were\nmade, and this can not have helped the\ndecision by Security.\nPure\nGenius\nWhilst a film crew was shooting an\nadvert for Beamish, a thief walked into\nthe unlocked and unattended dressing\nroom and took personal posses ions from the area. The items stolen\nincluded over \u00a3200 in cash, a \u00a3250\nwrist watch and other assorted items\nsuch as wallets and lessor value\nwatches.\nThe robbery followed hot on the\nheels of two others within college and\nit is thought that it could have been the\nsame person or persons that\nperpetrated all three crimes.\nCarson in\nCourt\nAndrew Carson the Assistant Bar\nManager who d is sap eared over a weekend, last January, with \u00a31430\nfrom the Union Bar safe was in\nSnaresbrook Magistrates Court on the\n17th August. He answered to a first\ncount of defrauding the Union Bar and\na second charge of feigning to defraud.\nHe was found guilty on both counts\nbeing given a sentence of twelve\nmonths suspended for the first charge\nand two months suspended for the\nsecond. The Union Bar is to receive no\ncompensation for the money taken.\nCashless\nBox\nFollowing the break in to the\nInternational Enrichment office, a cash box belonging to them was found in\none of the offices next door. Hidden by\na sofa, the box was found by Benjamin\nTurner, Deputy President, when\nmoving the furniture around. The box\nhad seemingly been forced open with a screw driver and the cash bag contents\nemptied and taken. The small change\nhad been left.\nThe Police were called in to check\nfor finger prints and record the new\nevidence. No useable prints were\nfound. Ironically some of the American\nstudents over here at the moment have\nbeen studying in the room for the last\nmonth. If the evidence had been found\nearlier the prints might have been of\nsome use, said a Union spokesperson.\n\n"

The fund to\nbe re-allocated annually is not\nmeant to replace housing benefit\nbut is intended, by the r Government, to fund students\nwho would otherwise not come to\nUniversity for financial reasons.\nIn light of this both the NUS and\nULU considered that the money\nshould be used to support the loss\nof benefits.\nOut of the \u00a39.5 million put into\nthe fund, London will receive \u00a32\nmillion, reflecting the higher cost\nof living. Imperial College is to\nhave an allocation of over\n\u00a3250,000 with a recommended\nsplit of \u00a3105,800 to\nundergraduates and \u00a3153,600 to\npostgraduates. The\ndisproportionate shares, compared\nto the eligible number of students\nin each category, exists because\nof the higher number of self\nsupporting postgraduates, the\nlarger number with families, and\nbecause they are not able to\napply for student loans. At\nImperial over a quarter of the\neligible postgraduates fund\nthemselves.\nA working group sat to discuss\nthe method of distribution\namongst the eligible students and\nworked out guidelines to share\nthe money. The Union were\ninvited to contribute to the\nmeeting and a number of the\nrecommendations were taken on\nboard. For most students this will\nprobably mean little or no\nmoney. This will affect those who\nreceive a grant and are eligible to\ntake out a student loan.\nFor undergraduates those with\nthe most need will benefit first.\nThis will include such categories\nas; self financing; parent ally estranged (no parental\ncontribution being paid); disabled;\nstudents with families; and single\nparent students. If the total\nallocation had been split equally\nbetween all the eligible students it\nwould have only given each of\nthem \u00a363.26.\nThe claims procedure will\ninvolve applying to Senior Tutors,\nwith claims over \u00a3500 being\nreferred to the central committee.\nPostgraduates will follow a different system which will\nprobably exclude most of those\nwith SERC awards. The awards\nare likely to be larger but fewer\nin number. An appeals committee\nwill exist to allow people to\ncontest decisions made by the\ncentral committee, or Senior\nTutors.\nThe Department of Education\nhas said that \"Each institution is\nfree to decide how to allocate the\ntotal among the eligible students\".\nThe recommended split between\npostgraduates and undergraduates\nis included in this. Imperial is\nplanning to move around \u00a330,000\nto the undergraduates from the\npostgraduates. The committee will\nalso hold back between 20%\nto30% of the total fund until the\nmiddle of the academic year to\nallow for students whose\nsituations alter drastically within\nthe year.\nImperial College is lucky in\nrespect that it receives a higher\nallocation per eligible student\nthan any other colleges in\nLondon, and probably the\ncountry. Next year is going to see\nsome fierce competition during\nthe battle for higher\nre-allocation, although the fund\nis supposed to increase with\ninflation. Said Benjamin Turner,\nDeputy President, \"Don't blame\nCollege if you don't get what you\nwant. It's the bloody\nGovernment's fault.\".\nJelly riding out,\nJohn Riding in\nAfter three years service, Adrian\n'Jelly' Johnson, the Union Bar\nManager resigned last Friday after\ngaining a place at Imperial once\nmore. Before becoming Bar Manager, he was in the Aeronautical Engineering Depart\nment but dropped out. He now goes on to study Mineral Resource Engineering in the\nRoyal School of Mines.\nHis resignation comes at a difficult time for the Union who are in the midst\nof recruiting the new Union Manager, a process taking up most of their time.\nThey also have to consider the appointment of a new Bookstore Manager for\nthe end of January. It now means that an added and urgent burden exists in\nthe form of finding a new Assistant Bar Manager by the beginning of the Autumn\nterm. This in time for the ensuing chaos of Freshers Week.\nMr John Riding, previously the Bar Steward, will replace Jelly as the\nBar Manager, and Tracy Sedgwick will become the Bar Steward.\nDr Finley, Jelly's Senior Tutor in Aeronautics first commenting \"What!\nHe's going back to School\" later said that \"despite despondency in the\npast I wish him all the best now.\".\n\n"

    "content": "Veni Vidi CV\nI left Imperial last summer, clutching\nmy 2:1 in Chemical Engineering in my\nsticky little hands, and determined to\nget a job in a completely different area\nto my degree discipline: journalism.\nAfter two months job hunting, this\nbook fell into my hands (while I was in\nthe FELIX office copying another dozen\nCVs) and I seized on it, wondering if it\nwould provide some extra insights that\nwould finally land me a job.\nThe title is an obvious parody of\nDouglas Adams' book, right down to\nhaving the words 'Don't Panic' on the\ninside front cover. Unfortunately, I have to say that in places the Job\nHunter's Guide is almost as eclectic as\nthe Hitch Hiker's Guide, if not as\ninaccurate.\nThe book would be better described as\na job hunter's guide to writing a CV\nand attending interviews (admittedly\nthis is not such a snappy title). In this\nrespect, it is excellent. There is advice\non setting objectives,\norganising yourself, where to look for\njobs, how to approach interviews and\nperform in them and what to do\nafterwards. The other half of the book\nis devoted to how to prepare a CV. As\nthe author earns a living by doing\nexactly this for clients, he certainly\nknows what he is talking about.\nHowever there are several important\nomissions from the book. Stephenson\ncompletely fails to mention the issue of\nreferences and referees. As I 've never\napplied to a job where they didn't want\nto at least see evidence that someone\nwould give a reference, even if they\ndidn't take it up, this omission can only\nbe described as appalling.\nThe other glaring omission is the lack\nof any information on how to fill out\ncompany application forms. Stephenson\noffers the advice that having filled out\nthe form 'attach a copy of your CV to\nthe back of it. In that way you will\nhave complied with their rules, but still\nbe presenting yourself in the way YOU\nwant.'but gives no help whatsoever on\nhow to fill out the form. Since forms\nare used 'to compare 'like with like\", as\nStephenson points out in the preceding\nparagraph, they are as important as the\nCV and some information on filling\nthem out should have been given.\nHaving said that, the book does handle\nthe areas it covers very well and\nprobably is worth its price of \u00a35.50,\nalthough it would have been nice if\nhe'd included an index as well as a contents page. It's extremely well\nwritten and very easy to read (I read\nthe whole thing in about an hour).\nStephenson's CV design may not be to\neveryone's taste, but it provides a lot of\nideas and helps you avoid most of the\npitfalls.\nThis book didn't really tell me anything\nthat 1 didn't already know, but if\nyou've never looked for a job before, it\nwould be a great help. It's a lot more\npractical than the sterile books usually\nproduced on the subject which\nseem to bear no relation to the real\nworld.\nBy the time you read this, I hope I 'll\nhave got a job and can forget about all\nTthis until the next time.\nLiz W. Cosmetic Surgery\nDear Sir,\nI am writing on behalf of the British\nUnion for the Abolition of Vivisection\n(BUAV) to thank everyone in the area\nwho kindly supported our walk for\nLaboratory Animals which took place\nin London on Sunday 19 August. The\nten mile sponsored walk around\nClapham Common was a huge success\nattracting more than 400 enthusiastic\nwalkers. We anticipate that the event\nwill have raised over \u00a320,000 towards\nthe BUAV's campaign to end cosmetic\ntests on animals throughout Europe.\nIn 1989, 12,090 animals including\nrabbits, mice, rats and guinea pigs were\nused to test cosmetics and toiletries in\nthe UK alone. Many\nmore animals died in European\nlaboratories. Products such as lipstick,\ntoothpaste and suntan lotion are force\nfed to animals, applied to their raw,\nshaved skin or dripped into their eyes.\nThe BUAV is leading the way to end\nthese cruel tests on animals with our\nhighly effective 'Choose Cruelty Free'\ncampaign. We have been successful in\npe/sua ding major companies such as\nBenetton, Avon, Revlon, and Estee\nLauder to reject animal tests. And to\nhelp consumers in choosing\ncruelty-free products we now list 200\napproved companies who meet a strict\nno animal testing criteria.\nOur latest move to achieve a complete\nban on these tests throughout the\nEuropean Community needs your\nsupport. Without it thousands of\nanimals will continue to suffer and die\neach year. Please help by making a donation towards the campaign fund\nand write today for your free EEC\ninformation pack which includes a list\nof cruelty-free companies and details\nof how you can support the campaign.\nThank you,\nClare Lothian, Press Co-Ordinator\nBUAV, 16a Crane Grove Islington,\nLondon N7 8LB Tel 071-700 4232\nTESTING COSMETICS ON ANIMALS "
