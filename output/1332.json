    "content": "upon setting foot in Kenya. The situation is further compounded by the\ndeath of their baby boy. Heartbroken,\nTessa throws herself into investigating the pharmaceutical companies\noperating in Kenya.\nPerhaps some things are better\nleft alone because not long after,\nTessa is found brutally murdered.\nJustin\u2019s usual peaceful equilibrium\nis knocked off balance and he sets\nout to discover the reasons behind\nhis wife\u2019s death. Holding on to his\nfaith in Tessa, he overcomes all\nobstacles (death threats and multiple beatings) to find out what Tessa\nhad given her life for.\nFirstly, the storyline was good.\nHowever, conspiracies are getting\na little old. It surprises me that a\nfilm with such a plot was used as\nthe opening one. There were some\nuniquely beautiful scenes that must\nbe mentioned though. The director did a fantastic job in the development of the love affair between\nJustin and Tessa. To put it simply\n(without gushing), it was intimate,\npoignant and beautiful.\nThere were beautiful landscape\nshots of Africa and the movie did\nhelp highlight the plight faced by\nthe people in Africa. And it should\ncome as no surprise that the acting\nwas superb. After all, Ralph Fiennes\nand Rachel Weisz do have enough\nexperience to carry this film to the\nOscars. Nevertheless, good acting\nor otherwise, it doesn\u2019t save the\nplot clich\u00e9. The days when we were\ninclined to believe in \u2018X-Files\u2019 conspiracy theories are over. What can I\nsay except- better luck next time!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nL\nady Luck must be shining\ndown on Ralph Fiennes\nbecause he is none\nother than the lead in\nthe opening film for the\nLondon Film Festival, The Constant\nGardener. I have to admit I was a bit\nbaffled by the title (especially since\nI have yet to read John le Carre\u2019s\nworks). The title indicates a film\nsimilar to stories such as Tuesdays\nwith Morrie, and as meaningful as\nthat might be, it\u2019s not my cup of\ntea. To my surprise, The Constant\nGardener was very far from a philosophical textbook.\nJustin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes)\nis a passive, reserved diplomat for\nthe British High Commission with\na passion for gardening. Before he\nsets off for Kenya, he chances upon\nTessa Abbott (Rachel Weisz). Unlike\nhim, Tessa is loud, wild, passionate and outspoken. Perhaps it is\nthe old adage of opposites attract.\nRegardless, Justin and Tessa fall\nmadly in love, get married and move\nto Kenya.\nHowever, it\u2019s not a simple movie of\n\u2018happily-ever-after\u2019 because things\ngo downhill after the wedding.\nUnfortunately for Justin, his wife\nbecomes increasingly estranged\nDisappointing start for LFF\nThe Constant Gardener fails to impress on opening night\n\ufb01lm film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe couple that plants together, stays together...or not?\nThe Constant Gardener\nDirector: Fernando Meirelles\nStarring: Ralph Fiennes, Rachel\nWeisz and Hubert Kounde.\nLength: 129 minutes\nCertificate: U\nReleased:17 September 2005\nHHHII\nKinky boots on the silver screen?\nIt\u2019s time to kick in some changes around here.\nT\nhe title itself is a big attention grabber. Kinky Boots\ndoes not just refer to a\nslightly perverted sexual\npleasure but also to the shoe fetishism common among women today.\nAfter having spotted the Selfridges\nwindow display that further illustrated this grand fantasy, I just had\nto go watch the movie.\nWithout a clue to what the movie\nentails, I expected to be enchanted\nby millions of shoes that you only get\nto see on the catwalk of haute couture fashion shows. Little did I know\nthat it was a film about transvestites\nsinging and dancing amidst the setting of a glum shoe factory.\nThe presence of a plot was surprising despite its predictability. Father\nowns shoe factory, father dies and\nson takes over factory. The difference here is a transvestite named\nLola, also a show-girl, rescues the\nshoe factory from bankruptcy. Lola\nhelps save Price & Sons, a company known for making quality men\u2019s\nshoes that last a lifetime, by convincing Charlie, the son, to tailor\nwomen\u2019s shoes for men.\nThe shoes in this movie are tacky\nand gaudy to the max (that explains\nthe presence of Elton John at the\npremiere). The highlight was perhaps the pair of plastic, red, snake-skin, thigh-high boots (sounds like a\ngood idea for Halloween? Not).\nStrange enough, this duo (an\nextroverted transvestite and a conservative gentleman) is so successful that they are soon showcasing\ntheir collection in Milan (the land of\nfashion gods and goddesses)!\nAlthough the film has a classic\nHollywood storyline (with a happy\nending), transexuality was not a\ntheme they explored thoroughly.\nNevertheless, I found answers to\nquestions I had had about men who\nliked to dress as women (I\u2019m not telling you the questions or the answers\n- go see the movie yourself). I also\nlearnt that \u201cthe sex is in the heel\u201d,\nsomething which I will keep in mind\nthe next time I need to dress to\nimpress.\nThis is definitely a movie to see if\nyou like shoes and are in need of a\nfew laughs. There have been several\ncomplaints that Kinky Boots should\nhighlight the plight of the company\nthat is about to fold instead of kidding about cross-dressing. Like I\nsaid, don\u2019t expect a soul-searching\nmovie. Just don your highest heels,\n(which by the way is in this sea-son) and sing your heart away this\nHalloween!\nNoora Hussein\nShoe fan Noora investigates the crime scene\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\n10\n\n"

The fair was organised by\nthe City and Guilds College Union\u2019s\nInternship Centre together with the\nCareers Advisory Service. The aim\nwas to give engineering undergraduates a greater exposure to engineering companies, and give them\nthe opportunity to discuss possible\ncareer options.\nThirty companies, including Arup,\nNetwork Rail, Procter & Gamble,\nRolls Royce, Shell and BP\n, attended the fair and many stands were\nmanned by alumni of the College.\nOver 1500 students from the various\nengineering departments came to\nspeak to the company representa-tives, and there was a general consensus amongst the students that\nit was fantastic to have an \u201cengineering-only\u201d event, where financial\ninstitutions weren\u2019t dominant.\nThe Rector, Sir Richard Sykes,\nand the Principal of the Faculty of\nEngineering, Prof. Julia King, were\nalso in attendance for part of the\nafternoon.\nProfessor Julia King said, \u201cWe\nthink the careers fair will be a great\nsuccess and we hope it will encourage lots of our students to consider\ncareers in engineering when they\nleave Imperial. Our graduates are\nmuch in demand. So many companies wanted to take part in this\nCareers Fair that we have had to put\nsome on a waiting list.\n\u201cWe\u2019re really pleased to see some\nof our alumni on the stands. It gives\nthe current students a glimpse of\nthe exciting future ahead of them\nwhen they see what our previous\nstudents have gone on to do\u201d she\nadded.\nIf you enjoyed attending the fair\nand are interested in helping with\nthe organisation next year, please\nemail: internships@cgcu.net\nAnne Winberg Baarup\nInternship Centre Coordinator\ntake the appropiate action including\nescourting people off-site\u201d.\nProblems have arisen at other uni-versities. The Guardian reported\nthat at Middlesex University the\npresident of the Student Union was\nsuspended for refusing to cancel a\ndebate he had previously organised\nwith Hizb ut-Tahrir. Furthermore,\nsix students at Lancaster University\nfaced up to 3 months in jail after\nbeing prosecuted for demonstrating\non their campus. They interrupting a speech by Lord Sainsbury,\nthe Science Minister, and had to be\nremoved by university staff.\nBoris Johnson, editor of The\nSpectator, once wrote an article\nfor The Telegraph about a religious confrontation between the\nAnglo-Catholics and the evangelical\nProtestants that promised to explo-sive. Nothing much happened in the\nendbuthereceivedmanycomplaints\nabout his article (perhaps due to the\nuse of some slightly inconsiderate\nlanguage). However, retrospectively\nhe says, \u201cThe remarkable thing is\nnot how much fuss they made, but\nhow little, especially if you think\nwhat we have come to expect from\nsome Muslims. I have in mind not\njust the murders of Pim Fortuyn and\nTheo van Gogh, but the trembling\nrefusal of a noted Koranic scholar to\nwrite an article for The Spectator.\u201d\nHe then quoted him as saying, \u201cYou\ndon\u2019t understand. These people will\nkill me if I say what I really think. I\nmean kill me.\u201d\nWhat politicians argue makes\nIslam so politically and socially hazardous is that some Muslims react\nto an insult to Islam and its followers with a very deep personal sense\nof indignation. This stimulates\nyoung men to become disenchanted with British society and politics.\nThis can further result in a minority\nof cases becoming extremists and\neven suicide bombers. Due to this\nminority, western governments, as\nMr Johnson puts it, \u201care now so desperately using new laws to decide\nwhat Muslims can say about their\nown religion.\u201d\nLast Friday, 21 October, patrons of\nthe almost legendary Sandwich Shop\non Gloucester Road were treated to\nan unusual sight as a mock funeral\nprocession, complete with three\nhearses and a New Orleans Jazz\nBand, walked by. Organized by the\nForum of Private Business (FPB), it\nwas held in protest to the extension\nof the congestion charging zone, due\nto happen in February 2007.\nThe \u2018mourners\u2019 staged the event in\na bid to demonstrate the anticipated\n\u2018death\u2019 of their trade, particularly\nas the charge was raised from \u00a35\nto \u00a38 per day this July. Despite the\nevent being well publicized, it wasn\u2019t\nparticularly well attended, with an\napproximate 1:1 ratio of press and\npolice to protestors, presumably\nbecause, rightly or wrongly, there is\nlittle sympathy for the plight of the\nrichest borough in London.\nFPB chief Nick Goulding said,\n\u201cvisitors and shoppers need to be\nencouraged to come into London\u201d\nand called on the mayor to suspend\nthe congestion charge until January.\nKen Livingstone has yet to respond.\nLocal residents associations and\npoliticians are concerned that the\ncongestion charge is \u201ca new poll\ntax\u201d and that it would \u201ckill local\nbusiness\u201d.\nThe protest started with a mock\nfuneral parade up the Gloucester\nRoad. After dismounting at the top\nof Gloucester Road, local representatives made speeches to the present\ncrowd, starting off with the president of the National Society, Alan\nSmith, denouncing the new charge\non hearses as \u201cno more than a tax\non death and grief\u201d, and he was\nhere to \u201crepresent local businesses\nthat will be affected by the congestion charge extension\u201c.\nLocal politicians also gave\nspeeches, with one local councillor\nclaiming that \u201cout of 60,000 residents questioned\u202670% or residents\nand 80% of businesses opposed the\nextension\u201d. Newly elected MP for\nHammersmith and Fulham, Greg\nHands, stated that his borough was\nfully behind the campaign, \u201cWe\nwould be worse affected, as our\nborough would get the displaced\ntraffic\u2026it would be a catastrophe\u201d.\nKensington and Chelsea MP Sir\nMalcom Rifkin was also planning\nto speak but was absent due to the\nvote for the Conservative leader\nthat day.\nThe crowd were in a frenzied\nmood, with constant chanting of\n\u201cKen out!\u201d after every speech. One\nprotester, speaking to Felix, said \u201cIs\nthis a man fit to be Mayor of London\nwith his \u2018Alice in Wonderland\u2019 policies?\u201d\nThe Mayor announced the extension of the London Congestion\nCharge last month, saying that it\n\u201cwill bring considerable benefits to\nthis area of London\u201d.\nMatthew Hartfield &\nLouisa Evans\nSouth Ken locals aren\u2019t happy about the congestion charge extension\nLeader, page 21\n\n"

    "content": "I\nn Omar\u2019s column he questioned the\naccepted truths and values of the European\nEnlightenment and contrasted them with\nother models of society in which religion\nis more prevalent. Much as I agree with a lot of\nwhat he says, my views (which are by no means\nconclusive) differ crucially on some aspects.\nThough first envisaged by the philosophers\nwho inspired the French revolution, the ideals and values of the Enlightenment are not\n\u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cWestern\u201d. They should not be\nviewed as the product of a particular historical\nperiod or situation but rather as the common\nheritage of humanity as a whole, as something\neveryone across the world should (and sometimes does) cherish and aspire to. It is monstrous to suggest that human beings should be\ndenied the right to self-determination or that\nanything other than human conscience should\nbe at the centre of decision-making and legisla-tion.\nA community/society should be able to opt for\na more religious life-style but these decisions\nshould nevertheless be taken democratically and\nself-determination in religious and other matters\nshould remain paramount. Thus Enlightenment\nprinciples can and must be upheld even in a\nsociety with a religious majority. Spirituality\nand belief is not within the domain of the state.\nReligion should not be imposed or discouraged\nby the powers that be.\nIt is simply not true that Enlightenment itself\nbecomes a religion just as intolerant as other\nreligions can be. Nor is it true that it is hostile\nto, or incompatible with, other religions. In fact\nsome of the advocates of this once revolutionary\nphilosophy were themselves intensely religious\nin their own way. The \u201cmarginalisation\u201d of religion which Hashmi observes in our society has\nless to do with the imposition of secular values\nand more to do with the dominance of capitalism\n\u2013 a system that glorifies materialism.\nWhat the politicians in power are doing in this\ncountry and across the world in the name of pursuing \u2018our values\u2019 is sheer hypocrisy. It is, in my\nview, in direct contrast to the doctrines espoused\nby philosophers from Voltaire to Rousseau.\nSadly most of the political, economic and social\nchanges we have witnessed over the past few\nyears \u2013 wars, erosion of civil liberties, removal\nof protection for those left behind by society\netc. \u2013 are actually taking us back to the bad old\ndays of \u201cthe Raj, Africa and Slavery\u201d as Hashmi\nputs it, rather than pursuing a more progressive\nmodel of society.\nIt would be very desirable if the world\u2019s only\nsuperpower, aided by its servile, bribed allies (no\nnames), was attempting in good faith to spread\nfreedom, democracy and human rights across\nthe world. Unfortunately, any scrutiny reveals\nthat the US (and to a lesser extent Europe) is\nselfishly pursuing its interests with a total disregard for these principles as it has done continuously since World War 2.\nI wasn\u2019t intending to engage in the routine\n(fully justified) practise of Bush bashing but\nat this point I can\u2019t resist. While George Bush\n(Tony Blair and other \u2018free world\u2019 leaders are\nfar from exempt) is sanctimoniously preaching human rights, freedom and democracy his\nactions all point in a diametrically opposite\ndirection: indefinite imprisonment without trial,\ntorture and humiliation inflicted on prisoners\nof war, pre-emptive war, attempts to undermine\ndemocratically elected institutions and gov-ernments, the list is endless. They are hardly\nexamples of a doctrine of democracy, self-deter-mination and the rule of law. Thus George Bush\nis a champion of Enlightenment secularism one\nmoment and a fanatical bigot when it suits him\nbetter. Such, it pains me to say, is the opportunistic nature of modern \u2018democratic\u2019 politics.\nThe pursuit of the ideals of the Enlightenment\nshould not be left in the hands of the selfish, corrupt and narrow-minded politicians to use for\ntheir own ends. It is we the people who should\ntirelessly invoke and aspire to the legacy of the\nFrench revolution and of all progressive thinkers\nand societies that have come since. The alternatives are too dreadful to contemplate.\nI\nsaw Pride and Prejudice last Sunday, and\nmy flatmate and I were getting annoyed\nwith all the lovey-dovey couples around\nus. They were all cuddling in that gentle\ndarkness that invites people to do very naughty\nthings, as all is allowed in the dark (except\nmobile phones). Naughty things like what? Well,\nloud handjobs for instance, and pissing on the\nback of the necks of the people in front of you\nand then pretending you had an accident with\nyour Fanta, which just happened to be very\nwarm.\nHowever, these sad, sad people were more\nannoyed with us than we with them, and just\nbecause we spent the entire movie discussing,\nquite loudly, the differences between the film\nand the BBC adaptation, and trying to estimate\nthe distance from Keira Knightley\u2019s lips to her\nchin. We came to the conclusion that it\u2019s approximately three feet.\nWhen the film ended we were in low spirits.\nThe director had evidently wanted to avoid clich\u00e9s and make the film as realistic and fresh as\npossible, but did this creative ambition justify\nthe lack of Colin Firth and kissing in the film?\nAlso, the film ended, not with a scene of the wed-ding, but with that of an old fart mumbling something to himself. The most anti-climactic ending\nin the history of cinema, ever!\nNevertheless, the film made me think; think\nabout how relationships between sexes have\nchanged. They have improved in a way, as there\nis more equality and freedom nowadays, but\nwouldn\u2019t you prefer to hear \u201cI ardently love and\nadmire you\u201d to \u201cHow\u2019s about a shag\u201d? Wouldn\u2019t\nit be better, girls, if we got more respect, and\nmen used poetry instead of alcohol as a method\nto get into our pants? Romance, guys, romance;\nthat is what women truly want: a 21st century\nMr Darcy. Oh, and he was rich too.\nIn some ways, however, I am glad I don\u2019t live in\nthe 19th century. The truth is that women were\nobjects then, in different and more diverse ways\nthan they are objects now. Austen portrayed\npowerful and intelligent women who were, to an\nextent, in charge of their own destinies, but what\nhappened to the weak ones, the ugly ones, the\nones that didn\u2019t care for marriage or housekeep-ing? They were simply outcast. The position of a\nwoman was determined by the man whom she\nstood by (or behind). This still happens, but I\nbelieve (I want to believe) that we have come a\nlong way since Lizzie Bennett\u2019s times.\nF\nirstly this week, I would just like to say\nthat the new Darkness single is really\ngrowing on me! I really tried hard not\nto like it, I really did! I decided a long\ntime ago that The Darkness were going to be a\none album wonder, well not even a whole album,\na couple of songs really, because everything\napart from \u2018I believe in a thing called Love!\u2019 and\n\u2018Growing on me\u2019 was, frankly, crap!\nTheir Christmas single, \u2018Don\u2019t let the bells end\u2019\nwas one of the worst ever. It wasn\u2019t even funny!\nSo on hearing they were releasing a new album\nI was resolute; it would be appalling. At first this\nseemed to be the case. I heard \u2018One way ticket\u2019\nand I laughed, how I laughed, because I really\ndidn\u2019t like it, I thought it sounded like a tortured\ncat! Then I heard it again, then again, then again\nand before long I decided it was okay, not great,\nbut it certainly didn\u2019t involve subjecting felines\nto various cruel devices! Since then I have heard\nit quite a few times more and now I am forced to\nadmit that it is actually very good, probably right\nup there with \u2018Growing on me\u2019, which means\nI was wrong, The Darkness were not a two hit\nwonder, they have at least three good songs!\nThis week I was going to write you a light\nhearted article about my plans to take the idea\nof no win-no fee from lawyers and introduce it\ninto football but unfortunately due to a story I\nsaw in The Times the other day I have instead\ndecided to get all heavy and political. The story\nconcerned two Albanian men and a Lithuianian\nwoman who had been convicted of tricking\nEastern European girls into coming to Britain\nand then selling them to people who forced them\nto work as prostitutes. They were all sent to\nprison. The woman, Vilma Kizlaite, got 11 years\nand the two men, Tasim Axhami and Emiljan\nBeqirat, got 16 and 21 years respectively. What\nannoys me though is the fact that both men had\npreviously been granted asylum in this country!\nNow I want to make it clear that I have no problem with geniune asylum seekers but it seems to\nme that if they are convicted of crimes (especial-ly crimes as serious as these ones) they should\nbe sent back to their own country, which is not,\nas far as I can make out what is going to hap-pen. Instead, they will sit in a British prison for\nthe next 10-15 years costing the taxpayer many\nthousands of pounds (more about taxpayers next\nweek when i discuss work paydays).\nIf asylum seekers knew that they would be\ndeported automatically if they commited a\ncrime, then I don\u2019t think many of them would\nbe so willing to risk it, especially if they really\nhave sought asylum because they fear for their\nlives in their own countries. I\u2019m not saying this\nwould solve the crime problem. Most crimes are\ncommited by British people and unforunately we\ncan\u2019t get rid of them so easily (unless Australia\nagree to accept them again which I doubt they\nwill, although they are, apparently, desperate for\nhairdressers).\nWe can, however, send foreigners back to their\nown countries for their own governments to deal\nwith as they see fit. That might help reduce the\ncrime level a bit. It would also make it look like\nthe Government is actually trying to do something about the numbers of asylum seekers and\nillegal immigrants, whereas at present they\nseem willing to let the system carry on until the\ncountry is actually full to bursting point.\nI suppose the only good thing is that with the\nGovernment\u2019s new early release scheme ( put in\nplace because of prison overcrowding), the two\nAlbanian gentlemen will be out within about two\nweeks, so they won\u2019t actually cost the British\ntaxpayer much at all.\nNo wet T-shirt contest = empty soul\nI should write for the Daily Mail\nIrene Lahde\nIain Heaton\nMichael Pittoni\nThe joys of enlightenment\n20\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\nA response to Omar Hashmi\u2019s \u201cCan anyone lead the Tories\u201d in Felix 1331\nLiked it or loathed it?\nLet Felix know which columist you like and which you hate: felix@imperial.ac.uk\n*The views expressed in these columns\nare not neccassirly those of Felix\n\n"

It\u2019s the London\nFilm Festival and I just got\nback from breakfasting with the\ndirectors at Sofitels. Last Friday, I\nhad the opportunity of meeting Yvan\nLe Moine. Acclaimed director of the\neccentric The Red Dwarf, he\u2019s back\nthis festival with a shocking version\nof Robinson Crusoe titled Friday or\nAnother Day that includes cabaret\nsinging (yes, cabaret).\nAccording to him, what he does\nas a director (as he points to a glass\nof sparkling water) is to show the\nworld the story of one bubble\u2019s life\nas it fizzes to the end of its life at\nthe top of the glass (right\u2026). Maybe\nhe meant to imply that our lives\nare short just like the bubbles and\nhe\u2019s simply telling the story of one\nhuman being. At that point, I started\nto wonder, what makes one human\nbeing\u2019s life so interesting that it\u2019s\nworth telling the world about?\nThere\u2019s a cute little girl standing\nnext to me. She has a stuffed raccoon in one hand while the other\nholds on the blue railing for dear\nlife. I look at her (and hopefully, she\ndidn\u2019t notice) and saw her smile at\nher mother. Her mother is perhaps\n40 years of age with smile wrinkles\naround her eyes. I loved her smile\nwrinkles and if I were to ever make\na movie, it\u2019ll be a collage of moments\njust like that one.\nLast Sunday, I joined the directors\nfor breakfast and met up with Liu\nJia Yun, the director of Ox Hide. One\nlook at the title and it makes you\nthink about cowboys and extremely\ncold weather. However, the truth\nis far from it. It\u2019s a documentary of\nher family and the problems they\nare going through. Family problems\nare one and a dozen but her family\u2019s\nconstant optimism was what shone\nthrough and she received an award\nin the Vancouver Film Festival.\nUnfortunately for her, due to some\norganisation mess-up, there was no\none to show her around London.\nIt was a Sunday and I had nothing\nbetter to do. Hence, I got to spend\nthe afternoon with her. She\u2019s not\nmuch older than most of us and\nshe carries a toy bunny with her.\nHowever, I was pleasantly awed by\nher story of how her personality has\nchanged since she entered the film\ncompetition.\nThe Film Festival has its share of\nforeign romantic comedies too. One\nof them is the film Uttarayan from\nIndia. Uttarayan is a film about a\nwidow and a widower finding love\nfor the second time. What makes\nthis film so unique that it made it\ninto an international film festival?\nDuring my short chat with the direc-tor, Bipin Nadkarni, and the pro-ducer. They told me that the story\nappealed to them because of how\nlaid-back and relaxed it was.\nI was a bit surprised by the word\n\u201crelaxed\u201d. It was partially because\nin a conservative society like India, a\nremarriage should be a little close to\nAn Apology\nFilm Felix would like to apologize for the act of plagiarism committed last\nweek for the review on Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. The person in question will be\ntemporarily suspended from reviewing films due to their misjudgment.\nTHE TIMES\nbfi\n49th annual\nLONDON\nFILM\nFESTIVAL\n19th Oct3rd Nov\ntaboo. However, according to Bipin,\nIndian society is changing and the\ncritics are anxious not to be branded\nas narrow-minded buffoons. Hence,\nthey are now more than willing to\nembrace anything new and shock-ing. That probably explains why the\nfilm received an award from the\nPresident of India.\nDreaming of Space is another one\nof those films that some might find\nperplexing. It\u2019s a film about a man in\ntransition. Set in the 1950\u2019s when the\nSoviet Union still existed, this man\nViktor tries to break free from his\ndead-end life as a waiter by imitating his worldly and out-going newfound friend, Gherman. Director\nAlexey Uchitel said he would like\nthe film to motivate people so that\nthey can make positive changes in\ntheir lives.\nIt\u2019s a film rich in symbology that\nmight strike a strong chord among\nthe Russians. \u201cIt\u2019s not a film about\npolitics\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a story\nabout a man who wants to achieve\nhis dreams.\u201d\nThe London Film Festival is a collage of films about people. Hence, it\nwouldn\u2019t be too far off to say that it\u2019s\na film festival that celebrates life. As\nproducer of Uttarayan said, \u201cOnce\nyou stop falling in love with any-thing, you stop living.\u201d Therefore,\nbe prepared to fall in love with the\nfilms in the London Film Festival.\nOops-here\u2019s my stop! Ciao!\nYuen Ai Lee\nFilm Editor\nDive \u2018Into the Blue\u2019\nWith the beautiful Jessica Alba.....\nInto the Blue\nDirector: John Stockwell\nStarring: Jessica Alba, Paul Walker\nand Scott Caan.\nLength: 110 minutes\nCertificate: U\nReleased:19 October 2005\nHHIII\nI\nt\u2019s a simple story. Jared (Paul\nWalker) and Sam (Jessica\nAlba) are a lovely couple who\nlive a simple life by the sea.\nSam is happy but Jared isn\u2019t\nand he dreams of discovering a fantastic wreck one day (all for Sam, of\ncourse).\nEnter the cunning, greedy and\nmalicious Bryce (Scott Caan) and his\ncurrent lady-of-the-week Amanda\n(Ashley Scott). Bryce is Jared\u2019s\nolder brother but they couldn\u2019t be\nmore different (yes, that includes\ntheir height.).\nOn a leisure diving trip, the four\nof them discover a shipwreck and\na plane wreck crammed full of\nA-grade cocaine. Jared and Sam\n(being the typical couple they are)\nwant to leave the cocaine alone but\nBryce and Amanda are not about to\nwalk away from millions of dollars\u2019\nworth of cocaine.\nTo begin with Into the Blue is a\nlate summer flick. Nobody should\nexpect a life-changing experience.\nThe storyline is simple and easy to\nfollow. The soundtrack is not inspiring but it is fitting for its targeted\ndemographic. The costumes...what\ncan I say? Less is definitely more for\ntheir target audience.\nForm your own opinion about\nInto the Blue. I wouldn\u2019t lie and\nsay it\u2019s something new or special\nfrom Hollywood because it\u2019s based\non a commonly used principle (that\nis, beautiful people sell movies).\nHowever, The Times Movie Mania\ngave out free tickets to it. How bad\ncan it be?\nYuen Ai Lee\nFree tickets!\nT\nhe Times Movie Mania\nis at it again! Thanks to\nthem, Felix has two free\ntickets to give away to\nElizabethtown (the latest Orlando\nBloom film)! I know you girls must\nbe drooling but don\u2019t drool just yet!\nFind out how you can get your hands\non these tickets!\nElizabethtown is Orlando Bloom\u2019s\nfirst foray into romantic comedy.\nPlaying an anally uptight Drew\nBaylor, he is forced to return home\nto Kentucky when his father passes\naway. Who could have guessed that\non his flight back, he meets and falls\nin love with the quirky but oh-so-lov-able Cate Colborn.\nBe the first person to tell Felix\nwhat Cate Colborn works as in the\nfilm (guys - it\u2019s Kirsten Dunst!).\nEmail Felix at film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nwith your answer, name and depart-ment!\nStop drooling and start emailing!\nWould you give up wealth for her?\n11\nfelix\nThursday 27 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\n"

Relax, Ping & Paul have the\nanswer.\nSeasons, 24 Thurloe Street, SW7\n2LT (5/10)\n\u00a33.00: Sausage, 2 bacon, egg,\nbeans, chips, toast, tea.\nSeasons, for those of you who don\u2019t\nknow, is the fish n\u2019 chip shop near\nSouth Ken tube. Despite being in the\ncentre of South Ken, the food here\ncould have been served on Brick\nLane to some down-and-out art students cruising the retro markets.\nInside it\u2019s dark, gloomy and full of\nbuilders which is normally a good\nsign since builders tend to like their\ngreasy breakfasts. Unfortunately,\nthe builders in South Ken must be a\nlittle out of the ordinary as well.\nThe breakfast had many good fea-tures, mainly the cheap prices, the\nW\nhilst I like to think\nI\u2019m the bee\u2019s knees\nwhen it comes to\ncooking, I accept that\nmy attitude towards\nfood may lean precariously close to\npretentious. Though in the morning I prefer my eggs delicately\npoached with a sprinkling of herbs\non granary bread and a side of fried\ntomatoes, other people have very\ndifferent ideas. The charming Ping\nand Paul have risked coronaries and\ngrease stains by sampling some of\nK&C\u2019s best breakfast spots. Enjoy\nwith a strong cup of builder\u2019s tea,\nsomething even I can appreciate.......\nHannah Theodorou, Food Editor\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThis week Ping and Paul investigate SW7\u2019s \ufb01nest greasy spoons\nwell cooked bacon and eggs and\nthe good old-fashioned thick chips.\nHowever, the sausage was German\nand watery, so if you\u2019re a fan of continental breakfasts then you\u2019ll probably like this place more than us.\nLa Brioche, 40 Old Brompton\nRoad, SW7 3DY (8/10)\n\u00a33.50: Sausage, 3 bacon, fried egg,\nmushrooms, beans, 2 toast, (tea,\noptional \u00a31 extra) pictured on left\nWe arrived bright and early Sunday\nmorning (i.e. noon) to be greeted\nby a friendly Spanish lady who\npromptly took our order and started\nmaking us tea. The caf\u00e9 was quiet\nbut the food was turned out very\nquickly. The toast arrived first and\nwas devoured instantly; breakfast\nfollowed shortly and was definitely\nless greasy than other more typical\nEnglish breakfasts. The highlight\nof Brioche\u2019s breakfast has to be the\nmushrooms \u2013 something a little different from the ordinary and nicely\nflavoured, they were definitely the\nmagic ingredient in this breakfast.\nCouple this with freshly fried bacon\nand a meaty Lincolnshire sausage\nfood.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nfood & drink\nA quickie before college?\nand we\u2019re talking a satisfying fryup.\nWe have to complain about the\neggs however; thick white and a\nrunny yolk. As for the additional \u00a31\ncharge for tea! The tea consumption\nof this reviewer vastly increased\nthe cost of an otherwise good value\nbreakfast.\nJCR, Main Walkway (7/10)\nSausages, bacon, egg (fried &\nscrambled), hash browns, beans,\ntomato, mushrooms, toast, black\npudding, kippers, porridge, cereals,\nfruit, tea\nWhy not start the day with a quick\nbrekkie before lectures. The JCR is\nknown to all on campus, although its\nfood has a reputation for being pretty unhealthy\u2013 it\u2019s only unhealthy if\nyou eat it everyday...\nThe JCR breakfast is a lot better\nthan most students who buy expensive French pain au chocolat from\nthe JCR shop tend to think. It\u2019s a\ngreat place to hang out with your\nmates, so why not munch on breakfast at the same time. The prices are\nall student friendly, but don\u2019t forget\nto bring change in the morning otherwise the cashier dude won\u2019t be too\npleased.\nThe hash browns and sausages\nare tasty, although sizes and varieties vary from day to day. The bacon\nis not recommended due to its lack\nof crispness and its comparatively\nexpensive price. The kippers make\nthe JCR stand out, injecting some\nEnglish pride into our college - but\nonly if you\u2019re awake early enough to\nget them.\nIf you like a little bit of grease on\nyour sausages, hot baked beans and\nhave a fetish for hash browns, then\nthe JCR is for you.\nNext time with Ping and Paul:\nOn our way to La Brioche, we\nsaw this new place near Organic\nPizza in South Ken, so we popped\nin to look at the menu. When the\nwaitress walked over and asked if\nshe could help, I looked up and my\njaw dropped. It took me a minute to\nengage first gear, by which time she\nhad gathered I wasn\u2019t just looking at\nthe menu.

I love\nthe library.\nWhen I was told I was an\nunrecognised user, the kind library\nhelp desk person told me to ring\nthe ICT on 49000 and ask them\nabout the new printing system and\nto get me activated to use it. The\naccented voice didn\u2019t answer my\nrequest and instead said to, \u201ccome\nto the ICT room 348 and I\u2019ll sort you\nout\u201d.\nDo you know how terrifying the\nMech eng building is? He\u2019s gonna\nsort me out?! What the f***? so I\nwent up there and the guy (the\nthird guy I got shuttled to, I don\u2019t\nknow if he was the \u2018sort you out\nguy\u2019) said, \u201cRight, well the new\nprinting system involves using just\nyour swipe card\u201d and I had to cut\nhim short before I kicked his shin,\n\u201cI know how it works, it\u2019s just I\u2019m\nnot a recognised user\u201d. \u201cRiiiiight\u201d.\nHe then asked me to email them\nthe exact wording of the error\nmessage. Well after a while of\nfaffing about, I became an officially\nrecognised user of the new printing\nsystem at 5.45pm.

It\nseems that you have missed out on\nhalf of the issue: Orient House, over\nin Fulham. While it is considerably\ncloser to the South Kensington\ncampus than Picadilly Court, it is so\nfar from any convenient transport\nroutes that regardless of whether\none takes the bus, tube or merely\nwalks, it is likely to take over forty\nminutes during rush hour.\nIn short, it is as inconvenient to\nreach college from Orient House\nas it is from Picadilly Court, and\nconsiderably less so to reach\nanywhere else in central London.\nAdd to this that the amenities\nin the hall itself are pitiful in the\nextreme: there are three washing\nmachines and driers amongst\nnearly two hundred students, the\nshowers flood the bathrooms (and,\noften, the carpet outside them) as\na matter of course. One of the lifts\nhas been out of service since the\nfirst day and the other is slow and\nfrequently makes disconcerting\nnoises and there is only a small\ncommon area which doubles as the\nentrance hall, which makes it an\nunpleasant place to spend much\ntime.\nWorse still, the kitchens have\nbeen cleaned only once so far,\ndespite assurances that they would\nbe every day, and vermin have been\nspotted in some.\nYet nonetheless there is\nno budget allowed for any\nimprovements that have been\nsuggested, although Picadilly Court\nhas been granted an expensive\nswathe of improvements. They are\ngiven precedence, being so far from\nSouth Kensington despite, as I say,\nOrient House being as lengthy a\njourney away, and a higher rent.\nThe wardening team and hall\nmanager are doing an admirable\njob in coping with this situation but\nat the end of the day the residents\nare still left in a very unfortunate\nposition.\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nRe-app, Orient House\nHow things change\nDear Editor,\nI take a year out to do a placement\nand boy have things changed! New\nbuildings, new buildings in the\nprocess of being built, no Southside\n(I repeat no friggin Southside bar!),\nnew entrance desk stuck under\nthe stairs in the Sherfield building\nand a brand spanking new printing\nservice involving just the swipe\ncard.\nWaterstones don\u2019t do the free\nyear planners anymore.

I was too shocked to slap the\nshop assistant.\nSome of the funnier things that\nThe author of the \u2018star\u2019 letter\nreceived each week will win\n\u00a310\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\nRamadhan\nDear Editor,\nHave you ever passed the JCR at\naround sunset and seen a large\nmass of people eating food together\nor praying? Ever wondered who\nthey were and what exactly it is\nthat they are up to? Ever seen your\nfriend Aliya or Hasan get some\ndates out of their bag and eat them\nduring a late lecture and think\nto yourself \u201cBoy, he/she must be\nhungry\u201d!\nWell never fear your ICU islamic\nsociety is here to fill you in on all\nthose mind-boggling questions!\nFor over one billion Muslims\nthroughout the world, Ramadhan is\na special month of the year, much\nloved and anticipated by all. During\nthe month of Ramadhan, Muslims\nfast from dawn to sunset every\nday. We as Muslims believe that\nRamadhan was the month in which\nthe first verses of the holy Qur\u2019an\n(Words of God) were revealed to the\nfinal messenger of God, Prophet\nMohammad (Peace be upon him-pbuh). The sighting of the new\nmoon at the end of Ramadhan\nheralds the celebration of Eid ul-Fitr.\nFasting is nothing new to Islam. It\nis indeed the practice and tradition\nof many pious predecessors who\nattained piety through fasting. For\nexample: the Qur\u2019an mentions that\nProphet Moses used to fast for\n40 days and Prophet Muhammad\n(pbuh) said that Prophet David\nused to fast for half of the year.\nAlso Prophet Jesus used to fast\nfor 40 days. So we find that both\nChristians and Jews recognize\nfasting as part of their worship\n(Christians primarily during Lent,\nand Jews during Yom Kippur).\nFor Muslims fasting is not\nonly abstaining from eating and\ndrinking, but also from vain speech\nand foul language. Also, by cutting\noneself off from worldly comforts,\neven for a short time, a fasting\nperson gains true sympathy with\nthose who go hungry as well as\ngrowth in one\u2019s spiritual life. Not to\nmention the various health benefits\nfrom fasting! It is therefore a time\nfor inner reflection, devotion to God\nand self-control.\nSo next time you walk pass the\nJCR you will know that this mass of\npeople is in fact a group of Muslims\nopening their fast in each-others\u2019\ncompany! This is where you come\nin.\nWe, your Islamic Society, invite\nyou to come and join us when we\nopen our fast to eat.

For those who\nare not aware of the SOF, its aim\nis to give money to students from\nunderprivileged families who are\nextremely academically able. This,\nI\u2019m sure you will agree, is a very\nlaudable cause. However, the Fund\nonly supports a very small number\nof students (around 20, although\nthis varies from year to year). Each\nof the UG\u2019s gets \u00a35K a year and\neach PG gets \u00a310K, for the duration\nof their course.\nI\u2019m all for getting as many able\npeople, from whatever background\ninto IC, and the fewer posh people\nthat come here the better, as far as\nI\u2019m concerned. However, I would\nsuggest that the amount of money\ngiven to each student is unfair.\nPresuming that each of these\nstudents will get the maximum\nstudent loan, possibly a government\nbursary of around 2K, and no fees\nto pay (under the current system\nanyway), \u00a35K seems more than\nenough to get by. There are plenty\nof IC students who are practically\nfinancially independent from their\nparents; working every day they\u2019re\nnot in college.\nI feel that the money raised\ncould be put to better use; half\nthe amount of the bursary and\ngive it to twice as many people for\nexample. Possibly use some of it to\nfurther subsidise rent for first years\nin halls. As a side issue, would\nit not be fairer for the College to\nmeans test for the amount of rent a\nstudent pays. I would readily leave\nmy finances open to scrutiny if it\nmeant I would have to pay less rent\nthan some Tory rich kid.\nI throw my full weight behind\nraising money to balance out the\nclass disparity here at IC, but I\nfeel the money could be spent in a\nmanner that would benefit a wider\nnumber of students, and as a result,\nthe College as a whole.\nYours truly,\nCarl Nash\n3rd Year\nSwimming\nSo now that the complete chaos\nof fresher\u2019s week has calmed to the\nchoas of term I thought I\u2019d go for a\nnice swim (or as nice as St Mary\u2019s\ngets).

Sadly when\nI got there I found that the security\nguard, while knowing the pool was\nclosed, had no idea about opening\ntimes for this term, and when I\nfound a timetable it turns out the\npool is closed all weekend. This is a\nreal annoyance. I have lectures from\n9am until 5pm or 6pm most days so I\ncan\u2019t get to the morning, lunchtime\nor evening swims and the only day\nI would be able to make would be\nthursday for the late night swim-ming, but I have meetings then. I\nappriciated being able to spend the\nafternoon swimming on Saturdays\nlast year and it seems ridiculus to\nstop us using the pool at weekends\nespecially while the sports centre\nis still closed.

    "content": "ALBUM REVIEWS\nAllegedly, Tennessee\u2019s long-haired\ncountry rockers My Morning Jacket\nhave gone weird. This is not strictly\ntrue, but they have certainly veered\naway from their standard, tried and\ntested song writing method.\nMMJ\u2019s previous three albums\nhave been full of a mixture of sparse\nand haunting songs, and a few full\nblown stompin\u2019 rock outs, full of guitar solo\u2019s and whatnot. Believe me,\nit\u2019s better than it sounds, especially\nwith front man Jim James\u2019 plaintive\nvoice, always wreathed in reverb\n(they used to record in corn silos!).\nFrom the moment you pop simply\nmonikered Z in your hi-fi you can\ntell that something has changed.\nOpener Wordless Chorus starts with\nthrobbing bass synth, short sharp\nmellow organ stabs and a simple\ndrum pattern. As the song breaks\ninto its, um, wordless chorus you\nthink you are back to the familiar,\nwith aahs and oohs over heavy cym-bals, but underneath it clicks and\nwarbles away oddly. And at the end\nit mimics Prince, as Jim James tries\ngoes all falsetto and white-man funk\non us! Experi-mental.\nWhat A Wonderful Man and Lay\nLow are extensions on their classic formula, being upbeat and fun,\nwith the tune carried by a guitar\nriff and bright piano. As per usual\nwith the band the drums sound like\nthey were recorded in a big hollow\nroom (because they probably were),\nand the vocals echo around for a\nsecond after Jim stops singing. This\nis pretty much where the comfort\nzone ends.\nGideon could be Mercury Rev, and\nif there was one band MMJ never\nused to sound like it was Mercury\nRev. But they pull it off and it sounds\nvery impressive, making it one of the\nstandout tracks from Z. It\u2019s proving\nhard to describe Off The Record,\nso bare with me. The opening riff\nis stolen from Hawaii Five-Oh, the\nverse is a bit like snotty SoCal punk\nslowed down until it\u2019s very, very\nslow, and the chorus is a little reg-gae, as Jim sings \u201cOff da rekkid, off\nda rekkid\u201d in an oddly childish voice.\nAnd at the end it sounds like Zero 7.\nSeriously.\nInto The Woods is in stilted waltz-time, like a fairground ride. There\nare lyrics about kittens on fire and\nbabies in blenders. Children giggle\nin the background, and things pop\nand whistle around your head. As\nit builds it sounds like they have\nemployed a drunk one-man-band\non percussion, and sloppily played\nTheremin scoots along merrily,\nbefore they are hi-jacked by fingerpicking gypsies.\nAs the album closes on the 8\nminute Dondante, Mr James tests\nhis falsetto again, as well as a good\nscream as they break into one of\ntheir trademark huge prog-country\nfreak outs. While Z is certainly not\nweird by some peoples standards, it\nmarks a startling evolution in sound\nfor the band. A brave and bold album\nfor which My Morning Jacket should\nbe applauded.\nJames Millen\nHaving been branded with the \u2018popular in America\u2019 label and securing\nthe opening slot on the Other stage\nat Glastonbury, things are currently\nlooking rather rosy for the Dead 60s.\nHaving said that, they were on tour\nwith the Bravery in the US, who\nfound out the hard way how fickle\nfame can be, and they didn\u2019t actually\nget to perform at Glastonbury, due\nto the stage being struck by lightning during the torrential downpours prior to their set.\nRiot Radio was released as\na single a week prior to the self-titled album; however it has had\nmonths of extensive radio play and\nhas been filling indie dance floors\nfor months, making the Dead 60s a\nhouse-hold name within the NME\ncrowd. Hailing from Liverpool, the\nDead 60s are refreshingly different\nfrom the Coral/Zutons clones that\nyou expect to come out of the city\nand their album was one of the most\npromising and anticipated of the\nsummer.\nThe album wisely starts with Riot\nRadio, and due to putting such a\nstrong track first, you can\u2019t help but\nexpect more of the good stuff to fol-low. The fast and furious A Different\nAge will undoubtedly continue the\nmainstream success of the Dead 60s\nwith the heavy bassline and catchy\nvocals making you nod your head\nand dance in your seat without you\neven noticing. The rest of the album\nis startlingly unimpressive. The\nalbum has strong reggae influences,\ngiving it a chilled, mellow feel, which\nunfortunately, I found quite bland.\nGhost-Faced Killer stands out in\nthat its ska-punk nature is strikingly\nsimilar to Madness, however unlike\nMadness the repetitively results in\nits skankability plummeting sharply.\nThe latter half of this album\nappears to be an extended jamming/\nexperimental studio session. Many\nof the songs are amazingly similar to\nHard-Fi, and you would be forgiven\nfor thinking that that was the band\nyou were listening to. Due to the\nspouting of opinionated, semi-politi-cal based babble, Hard-Fi somehow\nmanaged to slip through the net that\nfilters the good from the rubbish and\nachieve mainstream success, whilst\nbeing labelled the voice of the youth\nof Britain today. The Dead 60s have\nno such label, and as a result, have\nto depend on the strength of their\nsongs alone.\nThis album has no continuity,\nresulting in the feeling that this is\na band who doesn\u2019t know who they\nare yet and are still experimenting in order to discover their iden-tity. Perhaps like Hard-Fi, they\u2019ll\nget lucky, however a couple of good\nsongs is unlikely to compensate for\nthis, a collection of dull drivel.\nJenny Gibson\nHaving released a selection of solo\nmaterial on Rough Trade Records,\nJeffrey Lewis decided to team up\nwith his brother to form the Jack\n& Jeffrey Lewis \u2018band.\u2019 Having\ntoured extensively around Europe\nand America, on both headline\ntours and bills shared with bands\nsuch as British Sea Power, Radio 4,\nCornershop and the Fiery Furnaces,\nJack & Jeffrey Lewis are hoping to\nreach a wider audience with City &\nEastern Songs.\nBrought up in New York listening\nto both folk and punk, it is no surprise that their music encompasses\na wide variety of genres, with seemingly no connection in style from\none song to the next, apart from\nJeffrey Lewis\u2019s distinctive croaky\nvoice. The songs on City & Eastern\nSongs take you on an emotional\njourney through Lewis\u2019s life and\nexperiences, feeling so intimate and\npersonal that you want to carry on\nlistening and find out more.\nDon\u2019t Be Upset is a heart-wrench-ing, tear-jerking folky tale of loving\nsomeone so much that you just want\nthem to feel better, and whatever is\nupsetting them to just go away. This\nsong will make anyone who is in love\ngrateful that they are, and anyone\nwho isn\u2019t wish that they were, simply\nso that somebody was there to make\neverything better for them.\nWilliamsburg Will Oldham Horror\ndeals with the self-doubt and insecurities that Lewis feels with regards\nto his own artistic ability. This tells a\nstory about how an encounter with\nsomebody unexpected can lead you\nto questioning whether what you are\ndoing is worth it, and looking back\nat your achievements and asking\nwhether they are as credible as you\nwould have liked.\nOther stand-out tracks on this\nalbum are the reflective Anxiety\nAttack, punk-driven They Always\nKnew and the escapist and bizarre\nTime Machine, a reflection on\nJeffrey\u2019s alternative creative outlet\nas a comic artist and author. This is\nan album that everybody can relate\nto, dealing with the trials and tribulations of life, drawing you in more\nand more with every listen; a must\nfor anybody, which is everybody, that\nhas felt any element of self-doubt\nand worthlessness during their life.\nGreat stuff.\nJenny Gibson\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nBeards, bad reggae, and anti-folk\nMy Morning Jacket branch out, The Dead 60s prove worthless, and the Lewis brothers rock\nMy Morning Jacket - all real men have beards.\nJack & Jeffrey Lewis - pretty boys they ain\u2019t.\n9\nfelix www.felixonline.co.uk\nThursday 27 October 2005\nMy Morning Jacket\nZ\n(BMG)\nHHHHI\nThe Dead 60s\nDead 60s\n(Deltasonic)\nHHIII\nJack & Je\ufb00rey Lewis\nCity & Eastern Songs\n(Rough Trade)\nHHHHI\n\n"

    "content": "Vague science\nKath Nightingale and Christine Dimech have dinner\nat the Dana Centre with Prof Brian J Ford\nSCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 November 2005\nA\npparently monkeys like\nto throw snowballs and\nbears enjoy toboggan-ing. These were just a\ncouple of the stories that\nProfessor Brian J Ford used to try\nto convince his audience that animals experience a range of feelings,\njust like us. His talk, \u2018Do Fish Fall in\nLove?\u2019, took place last Wednesday,\n19 October, at the Dana Centre \u2013 an\ninformal forum for discussing science without getting baffled by technical jargon. There was also the\nadded bonus of a drink and a meal.\nCarrot and coriander soup was\nswiftly followed by Prof Ford\u2019s informal lecture. Drawing on his book\nSensitive Souls, Prof Ford used\nexamples of animal behaviour to\nexplain how we, humans, should\nnot set ourselves apart from other\nanimals on the basis of language,\nconsciousness or self-awareness.\nIndeed, some animals and even\nsingle-cell organisms were communicating long before we managed\nso much as a grunt. The behavioural adaptations that some species demonstrate, such as crows\ndropping walnuts onto concrete, or\nblue tits opening milk bottles to get\nat the reward inside, show that they\nmight not necessarily react purely\non instinct but are also capable of\ncognitive thought processes. These\nnew skills are also passed between\nindividuals, showing an awareness\nof fellow members and groups.\nProf Ford encouraged us to question the anthropocentric view of life,\nas many animals were here long\nbefore us and have been thinking,\nlearning, communicating and, in the\ncase of amoebas, even flirting, long\nbefore we had worked it out. So\nperhaps we humans, with our oversized brains (or \u2018cerebral cancer\u2019\nas Prof Ford charmingly put it),\nshould learn to show some humility.\nHowever, it seems natural for us\nto look for human characteristics\nin nature \u2013 we only really have one\nframe of reference. And Ford him-self, by using a title like \u2018Do Fish\nFall in Love?\u2019, was clearly inviting\ncomparison and applying a \u2018human\u2019\nconstruct, love, to fish.\nFollowing a serving of lasagne, we\nmoved on to a question and answer\nsession, where the audience thoroughly tested Ford\u2019s arguments.\nAlthough we all seemed to agree\nwith his ideas and the motivation\nbehind them (expressing superiority over a tobogganing bear would\nprobably have invited boos from\nthe audience), it became clear that\nthere was very little experimental\nevidence behind Prof Ford\u2019s asser-tions. Call us old-fashioned, but isn\u2019t\nscience based on interpretations of\nexperimental observation rather\nthan anecdotal references?\nAt times we veered off the subject\nwith talk of bird flu, robotic dogs,\nthe colour of egg yolks and a bizarre\ndiatribe against supermarkets,\nwhich while unrelated was nonetheless interesting and entertaining.\nAltogether, a thought-provoking and\nenjoyable evening, as long as you\nordered the vegetarian option.\nThere\u2019s a saying that it takes 21 days\nto make or break a habit. However,\naccording to a study published in the\n20 October edition of Nature, habits may be gone but not forgotten.\nResearchers at the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology (MIT) have\nreleased data that suggests that\nhabits are hardwired into a specific\nregion of the brain. This wiring is\nchanged when habits are broken but\nwill re-emerge when something triggers the old pattern of behavior.\n\u201cIt is as though somehow the\nbrain retains a memory of the habit\ncontext, and this pattern can be\ntriggered if the right habit cues\ncome back,\u201d said Ann Graybiel, the\nWalter A Rosenblith Professor of\nNeuroscience in MIT\u2019s Department\nof Brain and Cognitive Sciences, in a\nstatement released by the MIT news\noffice. \u201cThis situation is familiar to\nanyone who is trying to lose weight\nor to control a well-engrained habit.\nJust the sight of a piece of chocolate\ncake can reset all those good intentions.\u201d\nThe basal ganglia is the region of\nthe brain linked to habits, as well as\naddiction and procedural learning.\nResearchers in Graybiel\u2019s laboratory studied the neural outputs from\nthis region in rats.\nIn these experiments, rats were\nput through a T-maze. At the end\nof a long corridor, rats had to\ndecide whether to turn right or left\nin response to auditory cues. The\ncorrect choice led to a chocolate\nreward.\nDuring the process of trial-and-error learning, researchers\nobserved that neurons were active\nthroughout the maze run, the rat\u2019s\nbrain being on high alert because\nanything might be important for\nachieving a positive outcome. While\nthe rats learned which cues indicated the correct arm of the maze\nto take to find the chocolate, the\nneurons in the basal ganglia were\nbeing trained too.\nOnce the cues had been learned\nthoroughly, the neurons attached\nto the task only fired intensely at\nthe beginning and end of the maze.\nIn the rest of the maze, the rats\nappeared to work on autopilot, their\nneurons becoming quiet. It was also\nobserved that other \u2018disinterested\u2019\nneurons were silent during the\nmaze run, seemingly in order not to\nhinder the critical neural signals.\nResearchers then removed the\nreward, rendering the cues mean-ingless. This change made everything in the maze relevant again,\ncausing the neurons to revert to\nhigh activity during the run. The\nrats eventually stopped running the\nmaze because of the lack of reward,\nbreaking their habit and changing\nthe new habit signaling pattern in\ntheir brain cells. However, as soon\nas the reward was returned, the\nlearned neural pattern, with the\nbeginning and ending spikes, reap-peared.\nGraybiel speculates that the spikes\nin neural activity at the beginning\nand end of the maze reflect the\nnature of routine behavior. Once we\nget started, like the rats, we run\non autopilot until we stop. Specific\nneurological disorders also seem to\nbe linked to these spikes in neural activity in the basal ganglia.\nParkinson\u2019s patients, for example,\nhave difficulty starting to walk, and\npeople with obsessive-compulsive\ndisorder have problems stopping an\nincessant activity.\n\u201cWe are hopeful that this may\nbe a key to understanding how\nto treat bad habits like addiction,\nand also how to encourage good\nhabits that benefit health and happiness,\u201d Graybiel said. \u201cWe think\nthat these patterns will also help\nresearchers understand the fundamental problems in disorders such\nas Parkinson\u2019s disease, OCD and\nTourette syndrome.\u201d\nMagni\ufb01cent Desolation\nCompetition\nAnd the winners are:\nAlexander Haupt\nSimon Overell\nTevong\nHyowon Kim\nJoseph Jezicvongesseneck\nThanks to everyone who entered.

    "content": "Sixths take QM from\nbehind\nSport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\nThe day began with something of\nan exodus to Chislehurst. Frodo\nBaggins himself could not have\nimagined a dirtier trek, to a more\nbarren wasteland, where lay in\nwait a hoard of marauding minions,\nyearning for your dark ring. And\nit was with the same unease felt\nby Wayne Rooney\u2019s grandma, and\nthrough previous encounters of the\nabsurd kind that compelled captain\nAndrea to deploy the diamond for-mation.\n\u201cThe game grew tenser than Jordan\u2019s bra\nstrap\u201d\nThe match began crisply with both\nsides sharing possession until when\n10 minutes in, QM took the lead\nthrough a goal as dubious as they all\nare when scored against us. A throw-in, played back to keeper Andriy, led\nto confusion when he handled the\nball, gifting QM with a free kick in\nour box. The quickly taken set piece\nwas swiftly converted, but it was\nthrough their premature climax that\nwe were left unsatisfied, and like a\nnon-sixth team player\u2019s girlfriend,\ngot us digging deep inside ourselves\nto grind out the result. As the pressure mounted exponentially against\nthem, our midfield trio of Hamish,\nBen and Yong began working the\nmidfield like beer working a student\u2019s bank account.\n\u201cSkeen delivered the\nball into the G-spot\u201d\nThe second half saw the introduction of Jack \u201cand his beanstalk\u201d\nYip and Choy \u201cthe Duracell Bunny\u201d\nYong, who was eager to maintain\nhis record of having covered more\ngrass than Rizla. Our first goal\ncame via a corner minutes from the\nrestart. James \u201cand his giant peaches\u201d Skeen delivered the ball into\nthe G-spot allowing McNelly \u201cthe\nelephant dater\u201d to rise like a binge\ndrinker\u2019s stomach content to glance\nthe ball inside the far post. With the\nscore line level, the game grew tenser than Jordan\u2019s bra strap, but the\nmomentum remained one sided. Our\nsecond came in similar fashion when\nkeen Mr. Skeen whipped in another\ncross for the hustling Hasted to swoop\nlike a vulture on a Redbull overdose\nto nod the ball home and double our\nlead.\nDespite our obvious aerial prowess from corners, their defensive\napproach changed little. Our abuse\nof their naivety would have made MJ\nproud as James delivered the ball\nfrom the corner flag towards the lurking McNelly. The keeper\u2019s attempts\nto claim the ball lead to his \u2018packetof-crisps-like\u2019 hands (probably \u2018Skips\u2019\nsince they seemed to melt in the goal\nmouth) spilling the ball. It eventually fell to the head of the Mook, who\nnonchalantly lofted the ball over the\nstranded defence to seal the victory.\nQM rallied on in the closing stages\nof the game but like a pair of silicon\nenhanced shoulder boulders, our centre backs, Ricky and Tom, stood firm.\nAt times our movement was fluid,\nour passing crisp, our flair so down\nright sexy, ours weren\u2019t the only long\nballs climbing skyward. Such was our\npornographic display that QM left the\npitch with precious little Viagra to last\nthem their communal showers. All in\nall, an encouraging team perform-ance.\nAndrea Faggiani\nImperial College 6ths 3\nQueen Mary 4ths 1\nWe arrived in lovely Hertfordshire\nto find out that our forward fresher had got stuck......in London,\nFinsbury Park. Great!! Of course\nsomebody had to go and pick her\nup, so off went our fly half and\nscrum half... wait a sec aren\u2019t they\nquite important players? Who\nallowed them to leave? After arriving at the bus depot and realising\nthat this wasn\u2019t the bus stop they\nfound themselves panicking as\nkick off was now ten minutes away.\nAfter a few detours they eventually\nmanaged to find the fresher.\nScrum half and fly half reassured the fresher after her apolo-gies, that the game wouldn\u2019t start\nwithout these two essentially\nimportant players. However nothing could be further from the truth.\nA panicking Vets team and referee\nwho was worrying about it getting\ndark had somehow managed to\npersuade the Wye College team to\nstart the match with only 12 play-ers. The missing players arrived to\nfind a rather nasty scene greeting\nthem , a 6 v 8 player scrum. This\nmade us all later question in the\npub whether the rules were less\nlike actual rules and more like\nguidelines?\nAnyway, after all the panicking\nand rather sketchy beginning the 80\nminutes of Rugby that followed was\nenjoyed by all our players. Although\nwe never managed to break through\nthere tough line of defense to score\na try we battled hard and never\ngave up. Some tough performances\nwere given by all, especially by the\nlate arriving scrum half, Suzanne\nHorn, who kept the team together\nin a hard first match of the season,\nas well as putting some awesome\ntackles in and making some fantastic decisions. She was given Woman\nof the match by her own team. Lucy\nLe Cocq was given Woman of the\nMatch by the Vets because of her\namazing ability to accelerate away\nfrom the opposition with the ball\nand her ducking skills. We took four\nnew freshers with us, of which three\nplayed. They all did a fantastic job\nafter attending only three practices\nand it became apparent that they\nwould become important dedicated\nmembers of the team. Mary and\nHetty, both members of the Scrum\nfound themselves taking on the\nVets and each other as they fell\nover our try line leaving our two\nmembers slightly dazed after hitting eachs heads and sadly not the\nopposition, whilst the rest our team\nstood around chatting. It is felt that\nno more detail is needed on the\nmatch as we embarrassingly lost\n83-0 despite of all our valiant efforts\nbut we may yet appeal due to the\nunfairness at the beginning of the\nmatch.\nJessica Bird\nRVC Ladies XV 83\nWye Ladies XV 0\nWhy oh Wye?\nGet your T-Shirt NOW!\nAvailable in all sizes & colours\nincluding girl\u2019s skinnys\n100% High quality cotton\nOnly \u00a311\n\u2018PIMPERIAL\u2019 also available\ngimperial@gmail.com\nblind date\nLooking for\nLove?\nOr just a free\ndinner?\nemail felix@imperial.ac.uk with some info about you,\nand we'll set you up on a date to remember.\n\n"

    "content": "hideous to contemplate. Yet little\nmore can be done, other than a ruthless policy of destroying any fowl\ndeemed to be infected. Remember\nthe foot-and-mouth epidemic? We\ncould also follow the example of the\nNetherlands and keep our poultry\nindoors. This could be seen as an\noverreaction at this stage, but it is\nsomething, which should be considered if Britain faced a more imminent risk of contamination.\nH5N1 will be a pandemic which\nspreads rapidly across the world.\nImproved transportation of humans,\nnot to mention the prodigious distances travelled by migrating birds,\nwill scatter the virus across the\nworld. A human infected in London\ncould be in New York by the time\nthey started developing the first\nsymptoms.\nIn many ways, though, the fact\nthat H5N1 has now reached Europe\ndoes little to increase the risk to the\nBritish people. The virus still needs\nto mutate, and this is more likely to\nhappen in the unsanitary conditions\nof poverty-stricken South-East Asia,\nwhere humans and poultry share a\nroof and are in a more direct con-tact. It is true that the more people\nthat are exposed to H5N1, the more\nfavourable the circumstances would\nbe for it to mutate and spread; yet\nthe risk is lower in Europe. This is\nno reason to be complacent; rather,\nwe should see European H5N1 as\na herald of what might come, and\nstrive to be prepared for the storm\nwhen it breaks.\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOn a wing and a prayer\nWill Gates reports on the inexorable westward advance of avian \ufb02u and\nhow we are preparing to tackle the potential pandemic.\nscience\nA\nlready in October, outbreaks of a strain of influenza in migratory and\nfarmed birds have sent\nshock waves through\nEurope. The H5N1 flu viral strain\nfrom South-East Asia, which has\nkilled over sixty people since the\nfirst cases in 2004, has now reached\nthe borders of Europe.\nThe passage of the disease from\nits South-East Asian stronghold has\nbeen charted by outbreaks in Russia\nand Kazakhstan and, most recently,\nin a poultry farm in Balikesir, Turkey,\non 1 October. A further outbreak in\nthe Danube wetlands in Romania\nhas also turned out to be a case of\nthe H5N1 strain. In both cases, all\nbirds deemed to have been exposed\nto the virus were destroyed. Now\nGreece has become the first EU\nnation to confirm an outbreak of\nbird flu, although it is not yet clear\nwhether it is of the deadly strain.\nYet why the hysteria? This seemingly innocuous influenza virus has\ntaken the world by metaphorical\nstorm. It\u2019s big news in the Far East:\nin Thailand\u2019s daily Bangkok Post\na day without a story on bird flu\nis exceptional. The World Health\nOrganisation (WHO) is desperately\ntrying to investigate the potential\nthis virus has for causing a global\npandemic. The Netherlands, a country thousands of miles from the nearest bird flu outbreak, has ordered all\npoultry to be kept indoors to avoid\npotential contact with infected wild-fowl. All over the world scientists are\nfrantically trying to create a vaccine\nand understand the organism itself.\nA lot of people are very worried.\nEssentially, the worry is caused by\nthe perceived ease with which the\nH5N1 virus could mutate into something far more dangerous. The sixty\nor so people who have already died\nof the virus had direct, prolonged\ncontact with infected birds, and the\nvirus could have been transmitted\nfrom the birds to the victim through\nsaliva, nasal secretions and faeces.\nOnce successfully within a human\nbody, it is deadly \u2013 about half of\nthose infected die. While the virus\ncan currently only be contracted\nfrom contact with birds, it is thought\nthat it could mutate into a form that\ncould easily transmit from human\nto human. Once this happens, it\ncould spread like wildfire through\nthe human population.\nMuch of the hypotheses surrounding bird flu have been vindicated\nby recent research, which has resurrected the notorious Spanish flu\nvirus, which killed 40 million people in 1918-19. It has been shown\nthat the Spanish flu was a form\nof avian flu similar to the H5N1\nstrain, which mutated in order to\nadapt to the conditions within the\nhuman system. What set the 1918\nstrain apart from the 1957 and 1968\nstrains, which both killed several\nmillion people worldwide, is that the\n1918 strain was a direct adaptation\nof avian flu to be virulent in humans,\nwhereas the others combined with\nexisting human virus strains. The\nH5N1 virus appears to be adapting to be lethal in humans without\nhaving to combine like the 1957 and\n1968 strains, following the legacy of\nSpanish flu.\nThe similaritiy between the evolution of H5N1 and Spanish flu lies\nin the mutations of the three-gene\nsequencing for RNA-polymerase,\na three-protein complex. This was\nthe key for the Spanish flu\u2019s murderous success \u2013 it mimicked the\nRNA-polymerase structure found\nin other human influenza viruses.\nH5N1 hasn\u2019t so far exhibited mutations that would make its RNApolymerase structurally similar to\nthe Spanish flu one, but it is showing\nsome of them in some cases.\nWhen the pandemic arrives \u2013 and\nthe general consensus is that it is\nnot if, but when the virus mutates\nto be capable of human to human\ntransmission \u2013 what defences will\nwe have? The virus\u2019s relentless\nwestward surge has the government pulling out all the stops in an\neffort to be prepared for the numerous expected mortalities. Sir Liam\nDonaldson, the chief medical officer,\nhas estimated 50,000 fatalities in the\nUK. Other, more inflated estimates,\npredict as many as three quarters\nof a million. Stockpiling of antiviral\ndrugs, such as Tamiflu, has begun.\nThe Department of Health has publicised plans to buy 120 million vaccines against the virus, enough to\nprotect the entire population.\nThis has raised eyebrows, how-ever, as no such vaccine exists yet.\nScientists around the world have\nbeen working on the vaccine for\nsome time without the major breakthrough so desperately craved.\nOne problem is that the structure\nof the H5N1 virus, which causes\nthe pandemic, cannot be accurately\nforecasted. We cannot say precisely\nwhat its defining genetic attributes\nare. A vaccine against a generic\nstrain of H5N1 would not prevent\ninfection and may have limited\ncapabilities to counter the effects.\nEven the antiviral drugs are scarce,\ndue to the difficult manufacturing\nprocesses. A pandemic that hit this\nwinter would be a nightmare too\nNews in\nBrief\n5\nfelix\nThursday 27 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\n\u201cYet why the hysteria?\nThis seemingly\ninnocuous virus has\ntaken the world by\nmetaphorical storm.\u201d\n\u201cA human infected in\nLondon could be in\nNew York by the time\nthey started developing\nthe first symptoms.\u201d\nSince the outbreak in South-East Asia in 2004, which caused a mass cull of birds in China, the H5N1 strain\nof avian flu has killed over sixty people. Bird flu has reached the borders of Europe this month with possible\ncases being reported in Turkey, Romania and Greece. It is not yet clear whether it is of the deadly strain.\n\u201cVenus Express\u201d space\nprobe launch delayed\nThe launch of the European\nSpace Agency\u2019s \u201cVenus\nExpress\u201d spacecraft has been\ndelayed after technicians\ndiscovered contamination in\nthe Russian-made launcher.\nEurope\u2019s first mission to Venus\nwas scheduled for Wednesday\nbut will be delayed for several\ndays while tests are carried out\non the Soyuz-Fregat launcher.\nFourth bird flu victim in\nIndonesia, disease spreads\nIndonesia confirmed on\nTuesday a fourth person in the\ncountry had succumbed to bird\nflu while China said hundreds\nof farm geese had died, the latest outbreak of a disease that\nseems to defy efforts to halt\nits spread. The deadly H5N1\nvirus first surfaced in Asia\nbut appears to be spreading\nquickly to the West. Russia\nconfirmed more bird flu cases\nin poultry on Monday, further\nraising fears the disease could\nspread across Europe on the\nwings of migratory birds.\nScientists draft blueprint to\nprotect world oceans\nScientists are mapping out a\nplan for a network of marine\nparks to save the world\u2019s\noceans from fish stock depletion and growing pollution.\nAchim Steiner, director-gen-eral of the World Conservation\nUnion, said a conservation plan\nfor the unregulated high seas\nwould be produced by 2008.\n\n"

If I Had You, consists of four screens placed around\nthe room playing looped videos with\na soundtrack of piano music and\ndancing feet. It celebrates his grandmother\u2019s memories of honeymooning in Blackpool, with images of her\nwatching a couple dancing in the\ntower, an illuminated windmill, and\na fountain. Moving about the room,\nyou are captivated by the combination of the images, completely\nimmersed in the observation and\nreflection mirrored in the grandmother\u2019s face. Almond is sensitive\nand attentive, yet somehow manages to avoid an all-too easy descent\ninto an emotional agenda, instead\nleaving the viewer to reflect on this\nobjective documentation of a temptingly personal subject. This was, in\nmy opinion, the most impressive\nsingle work in the exhibition, and\ntruly deserves to be here.\nThe Turner Prize 2005\narts arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nSorting the worthwhile from the downright weird\nArt\nThe Turner Prize 2005\nTate Britain\nMillbank\nAdmission \u00a35\nUntil 22 January 2006\n10am-5.50pm\nWhen you think about the Turner\nPrize what comes to mind? The\nforefront of young, exciting British\nart? Pointless piles of bricks?\nSomething high-brow and conceptual that no-one seems to understand?\nWell, its back, and this year its full\nof black squares, shiny junk-shop\nbirds, sheds and bottom portraits,\nalthough lacking the controversy\nthat has become all-too inevitable\nwith this competition.\nHowever, ignoring my prejudices\nabout it, I went down to the Tate\nBritain to form an objective opinion\non the exhibition. The first artist,\nSimonStarling,haspresentedthree\nworks, each with narratives behind\nthem. The first is Shedboatshed, a\nshed which is apparently a work\nof art because it started life as a\nshed, became a boat, and was then a\nshed again. Who is he trying to kid?\nHe attempts in Tabernas Desert\nRun and One Ton, II to create an\nenvironmental message, but misses an opportunity to make a real\ncomment, instead attempting to get\nmore involved in the process of creation of objects. He may have learnt\nhow to make an electric bicycle, but\nthat doesn\u2019t make it a piece of art,\nand I was disappointed by his inclusion in the exhibition.\n12\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\nAbove: Simon Starling, Shedboatshed (Mobile Architecture No.2) 2005, Mixed media\nNext is Gillian Carnegie, the only\nwoman in the shortlist (the prize\nhas been won by just 2 women in\nits 21-year history). Famous for her\n\u2018bottom portraits\u2019, she is an artist of\nextraordinary observational skills,\nand has developed a distinctive and\nimpressive relief-style of painting.\nHer strokes are well-considered and\ndeveloped, and although her palette\nis generally rather dingy and her\nsubjects completely lacking in spon-taneity, they bring fire and drama to\nher paintings. These are more than\nsubjective studies; these are attacks\non accepted formats for academic\npainting. From her portraits of bottoms to her superb black paintings\nof forest landscapes, Carnegie successfully challenges and subverts\nhow we look at classical subjects.\nHer paintings are absorbing, and\nthe volume on display proves her\nabilities and expertise in a wider\nmix than any of the other artists\nhere.\nBelow Left: Darren Almond, If I Had You 2003, Four-screen video\ninstallation, Melody by Richard James\nBelow Right: Gillian Carnegie, Red 2004, Oil on board, 22.8 x 33 cm\nCranford Collection, London\nFinally we are presented by the\ninstallation The Kinks by Jim\nLambie. Named for an ill-fitting\nand rather pointless silhouette of\nthe band on one wall, it resonates\nin the psychedelic black-and-white\nflooring, created with vinyl tape. At\nonce organic and clinically modern,\nit confuses the eyes and, although\nflowing into the imposing figure of\nBlack Kestrel (Six Rorshach) by the\nblack paint splattered over the floor,\nit clashes with the other works on\ndisplay. The three sculptures here\nare oversized junk-shop models\nof birds. The others are colourful\nand shiny to the point of vulgarity,\nalthough comical in their general\ncheapness, and the whole installation seems bitty and unimpressive.\nAs you may have noticed, I was not\nexactly dazzled.\nSo, are Simon Starling, Darren\nAlmond, Gillian Carnegie and Jim\nLambie really the best young contemporary artists in Britain today?\nThey do provide immense variety-many aspects of modern art are\nrepresented here. They are all adept\nat their chosen craft, and present us\nwith complex and well-thought out\nimages. However, I leave the exhibition feeling less than affected.\nNone of the artists has truly\nmoved me, nor have I seen great\noriginality in many of the works.\nPerhaps commenting on the world\nis out of fashion in artistic circles.\nThey seem not to be innovating,\nmerely repeating and improving. I\nhave come to expect more than this\nfrom the Turner Prize, but maybe\nwith all art has been through in the\nlast 20 years, it has become near\nimpossible to surprise. I sincerely\nhope not.\nThe winner of the Turner Prize\n2005 will be announced by the panel\nof judges on 5 December.\nBelow: Jim Lambie, Installation view, Mental Oyster Anton Kern Gallery New York, 2004,Courtesy of The Artist\n\n"

Even with all\nthe action going on at a frightening\npace there was still time for Pas, our\nspeedy striker, to round the keeper\nand hit a shot at the lonely defender\nwho was standing on the line not\nonce, but twice when it was easier\njust to roll the ball either side of him\nEastern Promise\nSevenths victory march continues\nand add to the first half goal fest.\nAt half time changes were made\nwith Ian coming in to pair AD at centre back and Paul being shifted to\nleft back. Tuan, last year\u2019s captain,\nwas brought on for Pas, who was still\nwondering how he managed to miss\ntwo of the easiest chances he\u2019s probably ever had. However it is clear\nthat Pas has many a goal lurking\ninside of him ready to be unleashed,\nso future opponents beware!\nThe second half seemed to be\nstarting in much the same fashion\nas the first with IC playing the better\nfootball and controlling the game,\nhowever a routine ball over the top\nof the defence left AD in a race with\nsport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n28\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\nthe SSEES striker. It looked an easy\nwin for the IC man who is normally\nfaster than a speeding bullet over\nhalf a pitch until, in his eagerness to\nwin the contest, he pushed himself\njust a little too far and his ankle\ntwisted, leaving the SSEES striker\nto poke the ball over the onrushing\nArio, who had so far had an excellent game in the IC goal. Soon after,\nTuan thought he\u2019d try and score the\nown-goal of the season by slicing the\nball from outside the penalty area\nonto his own crossbar. He claims\nit was a brilliant tactic to play the\nball out of danger but few believed\nhim and every time after when he\ntouched the ball the entire team\nWith the sun barely having set on\nour majestic 5-2 friendly victory over\nUCL 7s last week, IC 7\u2019s went with\nrenewed vigour to Harlington for\nour opening league match against\nSSEES 1st\u2019s. SSEES were relegated\nlast season, so it fell to us to remind\nthem just how harsh and unforgiving\nfootball can be at this level. Team\ncaptain Sam made some changes to\nthe team from the friendly victory to\nensure we started the season with\nour strongest possible line-up. AD\nwas brought back into the defence\nhaving previously scored in the 6\u2019s\nfriendly loss to UCL 6\u2019s last week,\na slightly strange feat given that he\nhad never previously scored at 7th\nteam level.\nIC were playing at a level not seen\nsince last year. We were dominating central midfield and creating\nchances while SSEES were reduced\nto lofting balls over the top, which\nthe speedy centre backs AD and\nPaul were dealing with easily. With\nSam and Sandy in central midfield\nand two forceful wingers Jack and\nMatt, pressure was applied in endless quantities on the SSEES goal\nand after less than 10 minutes the\ninevitable happened. Jarlath was\nsent clear by a beautifully weighted\npass from Sam. He controlled the\nball and opened the scoring with a\npowerful drive into the bottom corner leaving their keeper helpless.\nStill our appetite for goal remained\nundiminished and five minutes later\nit was Jarlath again who heaped\nAdrian Doyle\nImperial College 7ths 5\nSSEES 1sts 1\nheld their breath in trepidation.\nA captain\u2019s goal by Sam was then\nscored to put the result beyond\ndoubt when a loose ball from a corner was allowed to bounce around\nin the box without being properly\ncleared. It was then cannoned into\nthe goal on the volley, leaving the\nSSEES keeper wondering where\nhis defence had gone. With 20 minutes to play, no subs and an injured\ndefender, Sam decided to put the\ninjured AD upfront, in what SSEES\nmust have thought to be a damage\nlimitation exercise. How wrong they\nwere! After a couple of runs were\nrightly given offside against AD, he\ndecided to punish the opposition\nby scoring a fantastic goal. Captain\nSam won the ball in the left of mid-field, spied Matt on the wing and\npassed to him in space. Matt then\nsaw the run into the box by AD and\ncrossed the ball just over the one\ndefender in the box. AD was then\nleft in a dangerous predicament.\nThe ball looked too low to head when\nit came to him, and with an injured\nright ankle he risked a lengthy layoff if he tried to volley it and injured\nhimself further. In a split second he\ndecided to launch himself at the ball\nwith a diving header. From the penalty spot he connected beautifully\nand somehow managed to lob the\nkeeper with a diving header from\nthe penalty spot to score his first\nleague goal for IC.\nA brilliant start to the season\nand an encouraging performance\nagainst a competent side, there will\nbe tougher challenges ahead this\nyear, but with more performances\nas polished as this and a few more\nspectacular goals, the sky\u2019s the limit\nfor IC 7\u2019s this year.\n1\nQuick Crossword by Fishface\n2 3 4 5 6 7\n8 9\n10 11\n12\n13 14\n15 16 17 18\n19\n20 21\n22\nAcross\n1.

This is almost as near to\nstalking without stalking as you can\nget. There is that solution, or you\ncan go for the drastic option which\nis to have plastic surgery, change\nyour name, phone number and put\non a French accent\u2026it\u2019s up to you!\nShould I Stay or Should I Go?\nDear Miss C,\nI\u2019ve been kinda seeing someone for\na few weeks now. Due to medical\ncircumstances we\u2019ve been unable\nto have sex for the last month and\nshe just wants to be \u201cfriends\u201d. In\nanother few weeks she\u2019ll be able\nto have sex again and well, when\nwe were doing it, it was amazing.\nI mean, she screamed the house\ndown and came five or six times\non each occasion. She says it\u2019s\nreally tough for her right now to\nmake physical contact with me\nwithout wanting it to lead to sex,\nwhich is frustrating. So I\u2019m staying\nnon-physical and we just hang out\ninstead. The thing is she doesn\u2019t\nwant me \u201cwaiting around\u201d for her\nto be able to get physical again, but\nI\u2019m not interested in chasing other\nwomen. I\u2019ve found one I really like\nand would prefer to stick with her,\nwhatever\u2019s going on. I\u2019m pretty\nsure she\u2019s not looking at anyone\nelse, as we spend a lot of time\ntogether. My question is: if I just\nstick with her and be there until\nshe\u2019s ready, will she think I\u2019m a\npussy?\nCoolNCaring\nDear CoolNCaring,\nNo! Oh my god, I didn\u2019t even think\nthat people like you existed! You\nhave completely managed to take\nmy cynical nature by surprise,\nwhich is no easy task!! No she\nwon\u2019t think you\u2019re a pussy. Mate she\nobviously cares about you and had\nthe same previous impression of\nmen that I did, that you\u2019re all out for\none thing. As you\u2019ve said that due to\nmedical circumstances (just slightly\ncurious\u2026..) she can\u2019t really oblige\nyou in that sense, so she\u2019s giving\nyou an easy out. This is your chance\nto stand up and be a man and show\nyou care by staying put!! Maybe\nit\u2019ll work out, maybe it won\u2019t, but\nat least you\u2019re giving it a chance.\nOh by the way nice comment about\nyour sexual prowess, just what\nthe entire of IC need to know!!\nHonestly! Men!\nTo Screw or Not to Screw\nDear Miss C,\nWhat should I do... The guy I\u2019m in\nlove with - I don\u2019t think he wants\na relationship with me, but he\ndefinitely wants to screw me. I\u2019ve\nbeen holding out because I want\nsomething more with him but now\nI feel it\u2019s becoming clear that will\nnever happen. Should I just fuck\nthe shit out of him in order to move\non OR maintain my pride and\ndignity and let us walk away from\neach other? It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t think\nabout sex with him a lot!\nTorn Apart\nDear Torn apart,\nYou said its\u2019 becoming clear that\u2019s\nall he wants from you?? How do you\nknow?? First and foremost you need\nto talk to him and find out what he\nactually does want from you. If it\nends up that all he wants is a shag\nbuddy then you need to walk away.\nSleeping with him is just asking\nfor trouble but hey maybe that\u2019s\nwhat you\u2019re looking for. Be warned\nthough, going down that track has\nevery chance of you ending up as a\npsycho obsessive stalker. If you\u2019ve\nreally built up that much sexual\nfrustration then a one night stand\nis an option, but I wouldn\u2019t advise\ngoing into any relationships until\nyou are defiantly over him or else\nthis could end up as a long term\nproblem. My main advice is talk\nto him, you never know, men can\nsurprise you. Maybe he\u2019s sitting\nthere pinning for you\u2026..waiting for\nyou to make the first move.\nDear Miss Con\ufb01dentiality...\nHey guys. I\u2019m back again, and I\u2019ve\ngot good news, the best letter I\nreceive next week will win a copy\nof PC computer game Blitzkrieg\nor a CD albulm of their choice\nfrom the Felix pile-o-crap.\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nMiss C.\nMystic stars\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nagony.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n24\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\n\n"

Felix received claims that\nthe College deliberately booked\nthe Great Hall at this time to prevent the Islamic Society using it for\nprayer.

He was\ninspired by brightly illuminated billboards similar to those found at bus\nshelters and started using colour\ntransparencies mounted in wall-hung light boxes. These are often\nscaled to life size so it feels like you\nare able to step inside the frame and\nstand on the fringes of the action,\nbeing physically and almost voyeur-istically involved in the images.\nAdding to his originality as a pho-tographer, spontaneity does not\ninterest Wall. If he sees an image he\nwishes to capture, instead of taking\na photograph there and then, he\nrecreates the moment in his studio\nusing amateur actors, costumes and\ndigital technology. Some of these\nstaged compositions have taken\nmore than a year to perfect and one\nof his most well known pictures,\nA Sudden Gust of Wind (1993), is\ncomposed of more than 100 photo-graphs, blurring the line between\ndocument and fabrication. He has\ndescribed his own work as being\neither \u2018cinematographic\u2019 or \u2018documentary,\u2019 using techniques normally\nassociated with film production.\nThe multiple layers and elaborate\ndetail of his pictures add depth,\nencouraging the viewer to closely\ninspect an image thus allowing hidden elements to reveal themselves.\nFor example, at first glance there\nseems only to be one person in Forest\n(2001), but as you look between the\nbranches it is possible to make out\nthe figure of a man. There are also\nshadowy corners that recede into\nthe background and half-open doors\nthat let the viewer use their imagination to explore what is beyond.\nDespite his images being manipulated snapshots, they appear realis-tic. Wall wished to create characters\nthat do not embody his point of\nview, but are based on situations\nhe has witnessed and represent\nPhotography\nJeff Wall: Photographs 1978-2004\nTate Modern\nUntil 8 January 2006\nTickets \u00a37/\u00a35.50 Students\n13\nfelix\nThursday 27 October 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nJe\ufb00 Wall: Art imitates life\npeople of modern life. He conveys\nsocial observations, for example, in\nMimic (1982) where the simple racist gesture reveals the meaning of\nthe photograph, but he tries to avoid\na moralistic attitude. Many of his\neveryday life pictures seem bleak,\nsuch as the street scenes and his\npanoramic landscapes of suburbia,\nwhere he has used locations around\nVancouver that he knows well.\nMy personal favourites include\nDead Troops Talk (1992), a purely\nimaginary vision where soldiers\nthat have been killed in the battlefield engage in conversation, each\nresponding differently to their death.\nThe Flooded Grave (1998 \u2013 2000)\ndepicts a cemetery and a close-up\nof sea-life submerged in an open\ngrave, the brightly coloured starfish\nand anemones a stark contrast to\nwhat you expect to see in such a\nplace. His most recent work, A view\nfrom an apartment (2004 \u2013 2005)\nis a domestic scene that was set\nin an apartment especially rented\nfor the purpose, where one of the\nwomen in the picture was asked to\nfurnish it and live in it as if it were\nher own. The scene is heightened\nthrough its meticulous composition\nand the documentary material is\ntransformed to that of a cinemato-graphic image, creating an interface\nbetween truth and fiction.\nAll photography contains an element of reportage, but Wall has\ndeveloped this and uses references\nto film, literature and the history of\nart. His elaborate, staged creations\nas well as his more traditional photographic projects deserve recognition and make him one of the most\ninfluential artists working today.\nHelene Myrvang\nThe Donmar Warehouse, famous for\nits outstanding and daring produc-tions, has moved its show Mary\nStuart into the West End. People\nhave been queuing around the block\nat its 250-seater theatre in Covent\nGarden to get tickets, and critics\nhave been raving. So is it really that\ngreat? Or is it all just hype? I went\nalong to find out.\nMary Stuart is an 18th century\nplay by Fredrich Schiller, and was\nrevived for the Donmar by Peter\nOswald. Schiller\u2019s portrayal of the\nextraordinary relationship between\nMary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth\nI is not entirely historically accu-rate, but it is a fascinating and compelling story of power, passion, faith\nand honour.\nCentring on Mary, Elizabeth,\nElizabeth\u2019s lover Leicester and the\nfictional English noble, Mortimer,\nwho is sympathetic to Mary, the play\ncharts Mary\u2019s last few days locked\nup in prison. The excellent Janet\nMcTeer shows us her frivolous,\nemotional side in the company of\nher nurse, and her strong and noble\nfront to her enemies, the English.\nElizabeth, played by the equally\nbrilliant Harriet Walter, holds the\npower to decide whether Mary\nlives or dies. However, as the play\nprogresses and Elizabeth\u2019s advisors\npull her harder and harder in each\ndirection, she displays less and less\nthe strength of character that the\nsituation demands of a queen and\nwhich is so amply shown by Mary. At\ntheir single meeting in the gardens\nof Mary\u2019s prison, Elizabeth attempts\nto crush her and make her humble,\nbut she is thwarted by Mary\u2019s highly emotive and articulate speech.\nElizabeth simply cannot match the\npassion of the Scot, who now has\nnothing left to lose. At the end of\nthe play it is Mary, not Elizabeth,\nwho is able to overcome the scheming Leicester and rise up to what is\nasked of her. Elizabeth is left alone,\ntrusting no one and ashamed by her\nactions.\nThe production is flawless. Largely\nminimalist in style, it uses colour,\ncostume and effects only when\nthey produce the most impressive\neffects. Tudor dresses for the two\nwomen highlight their stark contrast in the eyes of the world with\nthe sharp-suited men who surround\nand advise them. They merge into\nthe background, a grey wall of advisors for the two queens, with only\nLeicester wearing any distinguishable colour..\nThis is theatre at its best. It will\nmake you laugh, it will make you\nthink, it will involve you and enlighten you. Go and see it.\n\u201cWhy does the\nsight of her make\nme ashamed?\u201d\nAbove: A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai) 1993, Photographic\ntransparency and illuminated display case, 2500 x 3970 mm, Tate.\nLeft: After the book Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison, The Prologue 1999\n- 2000, Transparency in lightbox, 1740 x 2505 mm, Emmanuel Hoffmann\nFoundation\n\n"

Clearly, I\u2019ve caught you\non a bad week \u2013 I\u2019m aware fresher\u2019s\nflu and glandular fever are doing\nthe rounds. The kissing disease can\nbe a very distressing thing if you\u2019re\nanywhere near as capricious as I\nam! *sigh*\nThose were the days.. my\ngregariousness is very much a\nthing of the past. A bout of the\nabovementioned flu put paid to my\nsex drive, and as a result, I\u2019ve not\nbeen able to spread myself around\ntown as liberally as I\u2019m known to be\ncapable of ;)\nHowever, not baring my Brazilian\nhas led to adventures of another\nkind. No, not the romantic kind \u2013\njust the flirtatious; romance is dead,\nas Lisa Simpson let us know on\nValentine\u2019s. It\u2019s been homogenised\nand commercialised by Hallmark,\nthe way in which two thousand\nyears of Indian culture has been\ncompacted into one bite-sized\nWalkers\u2019 tikka masala crisp.\nMy adventures began when I got\nallocated an extremely attractive\nplacement partner. Mr T, as he\nshall be known, has indie hotness\noozing out of every pore. His tight\npinstriped drainpipes do wonders\nfor his slender (convex) buttocks,\nand his dark curly mop and cheeky\ndimples make my world go round.\nAll very well, until I discover that\nMr T has got a girlfriend. A long\ndistance one of three years and\ncounting. What\u2019s a lady got to\ndo when her pride is at stake?\nTake the high road and walk it,\nthat\u2019s what \u2013 I\u2019m not going to be\nbranded a homewrecker when just\nsweetness and light are at stake.\nI\u2019d think twice if better grades, in\nthe case of a course examiner were\nthe goods on offer. Or a fully-funded\nblack Amex card, come to think of\nit.\nMaterial concerns aside, I\nunexpectedly ran into mystery\nman II. He came in the shape of a\nSagittarian sex-god renowned for\nplaying drums in one of the world\u2019s\nbest metal bands. His rhythm was\nintact, and his Atlantan drawl got\nme all flustered. When hearing that\nhe wanted to hang out with me\ncome his next visit to the UK, I wet\nmy pants. Supposedly my accent\nhad got him in a spot of bother! I\u2019d\nrather not wonder what sort of tizz\nhis wife would be in if she heard\nof my dulcet tones \u2013 she\u2019s one of\nmy personal heroes, I\u2019ll have you\nknow, so I\u2019d hate to be the one to\nbreak her life when she inspired me\ngreatly into making mine.\nFallen idols aside, there\u2019s little\nkeeping my hands busy. I\u2019ve got\nthe Travel Channel\u2019s Zay Harding\nto think of when I close my eyes\nand go to sleep.

Well it\nis. For those of you that don\u2019t know\na leader is where the newspaper\nexpresses its views on the news. So\nits also an editorial.\nExtremists at Imperial\nIts quite worrying that such\npersons were at our Freshers\nFayre. The fact they were posing as\nsomething else is even scarier, one\nof them actually stopped me asked\nif I wanted to sign their petition.\nI don\u2019t normally sign petitions as\na rule (journalists should try not\nto have strong views), but people\ncould have been signing what they\nthought to be a harmless petition\nonly to discover later that in fact\nthey were putting their name to\nsomething else entirely.\nIt seems that Imperial is no the\nonly university with this problem,\nthe issue made the front page\nof The Beaver, LSE\u2019s student\nnewspaper, last week. But it is a\nproblem we should be working on.\nI don\u2019t understand why our Union\ndoes not have a specific ban on\nHizub ut-Tahir. If the NUS view\nthem as such a problem to place\na specific ban why does our Union\nnot see fit to apply such a ban. I\nknow ICU feel they are above the\nNUS, but surely in this case they\nshould follow the NUS\u2019s example.\nA specific ban on the group would\nsurely send them a stronger\nmessage than a blanket equal\nopportunities policy.\nAlthough they were present at\nFreshers\u2019 Fayre there is nothing\nto suggest that there is an active\npresence at College. So please don\u2019t\nworry unnecessarily, although if\nyou do have any specific concerns\ncontact College authorities or the\npolice.\nCongestion charge\nThe western extension of the\ncongestion charge to include the\narea surrounding Imperial\u2019s South\nKen campus must surely be a good\nthing for both students and staff.\nNearly all students use public\ntransport to get to College, a large\nnumber of those using buses.\nSince the introduction of congestion charging in central London,\nbus journey times have decreased\ndramatically.

    "content": "The Prison House centres around\nJimmy, a convict held for reasons\nleft unspecified until the end, and\nrecounts both his incarceration in\nthe hellish Seven Towers prison and\nevents from his past.\nUnderstandably, those who do not\nappreciate distressing or unpleasant subject matter would best be\nadvised to avoid John King\u2019s works.\nThe Prison House in particular\nstarts off bleak, dark and nasty then\ncontinues in this vein until the end.\nYet nonetheless it is not an especially depressing read (if you can\nget past the various acts of sadism\nand the like that occur throughout)\ngiven that a central theme of the\nnovel is hope there are moments of\nlevity and a sense of humour prevails that is not always as bleak as\none might expect.\nKing makes few concessions\ntoward accessibility. The reader is\nsomewhat thrown in at the deep end\nwith regards to the story, beginning\nas it does with a none too pleasant\nrape scene.\nBut if one can cope with such\nobstacles, there is a rewarding, edifying read at its heart.\nPowerful and shocking -a work of brilliance\nbooks books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe Prison House\nby John King\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nIn recent years it has become de\nrigeur for any cinematic or literary phenomenon to have a parody\nknocked off and published as soon\nas possible in order to cash in as\neffectively as possible.\nAs such, it is somewhat bemusing\nto encounter a recently published\n\u201cparody\u201d of Bill Bryson\u2019s A Short\nHistory of Nearly Everything, itself\npublished some two and a half years\nago, and although selling well, hardly a publishing phenomenon even at\nthe time.\nIt soon becomes clear, however,\nthat this is not a parody in the truest\nsense - beyond sending up the title,\nthis book bears no resemblance to\nthat which it is, apparently, lam-pooning. Where its predecessor is\nan in-depth tome detailing physics,\nchemistry, geology and the like, this\nis a collection of inane, pointless\ntrivia about stuff, things and other\nsuch weighty matters.\nInside are found the same collection of poorly chosen facts, although\nthis time the subject matter is more\nconstrained focusing, as the title\nsuggests, on Britain.\nIt is quite inconceivable that anyone would buy this sort of novelty tat\nfor themselves, so the target market\nwould appear to be those panic-buy-ing presents for unpopular relations\nand vague acquaintances in the last\nfew seconds before Christmas.\nWorth giving a miss, on the whole.\nA Shite History of\nNearly Everything\nby A Parody\nGross Britain\nby Taffy St George McScot\nHugh Stickley Mansfield\nM\ny two pence: this is\npowerful and shock-ing; a work of brilliance that will leave\nyou in awe at the\ndepths of thought that could possibly have crafted such a novel full of\nlaughter and tears. A very original\nstyle of writing \u2013 stick with it, it is\ndefinitely worth it. Told from the\nperspective of a small girl, one of a\npair of \u201ctwo-egg\u201d twins separated at\na young age. This is a story of the\ndestruction of a small happy family,\nthe society that smiled and nodded\nin approval at the pain it saw as\nright and a victim who inevitably\nbecame more useful to the world\ndead than he ever was alive. Winner\nof the Booker Prize 1997 it is, in a\nword, different.\nMs Roy has done something quite\nextraordinary in the writing of this\nnovel. She has attempted to ruthlessly open our eyes to the hypocrisy that exists in society, in an\nuncompromising and brutal man-ner, with no sense of hope or silver\nlining to her dark cloud, while, at the\nsame time, endeavouring to tell us\na story. No, this novel is not political\nrhetoric about social justice or free-dom, in its blatant sense, nor is it the\nkind superimposed onto a story to\noh-so-subtly put the author\u2019s political ideology into the reader\u2019s head.\nNo, something of that nature would\ndepressing. It will make you laugh,\nthat I can guarantee to every reader\nwho knows how to laugh, but it will\nbe the kind of laughter that can only\nbe accompanied by tears. Ms Roy\u2019s\nviewpoint demands a completely\nnew style of writing to portray the\ninnocence of the young girl and how\nshe views the world, and she delivers marvellously. Ms Roy allows the\nreader to be fully aware of the loss\nto come very early on. She gets rid\nof the \u2018standard\u2019 cliff-hanger that is\nused by so many authors to drop the\n\u2018bad news\u2019 as a proverbial bombshell and make emotional capital\nout of the reader\u2019s unsuspecting\nmind as it reels to the sudden pain\ninflicted upon the story\u2019s charac-ters. Stepping out of this trend with\nan obvious flair, she daringly flaunts\nevery secret to the reader, in what\nmay be considered a risky step sure\nto lose the reader\u2019s interest, instead\nof keeping them guessing. However,\nthe effect if quite the opposite; with\nthe tragedy already revealed, every\nhappy moment viewed in hindsight\nis tinged with the pain of what is to\ncome. As we get to know our characters better, the pain becomes all\nthe more real. Laughter and tears\nindeed.\nComparable in passion and narrative to To Kill a Mockingbird by\nHarper Lee but on a wider scope\nof themes and issues, this beautiful novel left this reader reeling.\nThe refreshing pace, writing style\nand comfortable, oblivious bliss\nof the central character all add to\nthe overall power of a simple story\nwhich leave the reader questioning\nthe meaning of love and the value\nof life.\nThe God of Small Things\nby Arundhati Roy\nRetesh Bajaj\nhave been expected and \u2018normal\u2019, in\nthe literary world. What Ms Roy has\nactually given us is a piece of literature (and I certainly mean literature\nin every sense of the word) that puts\nforward an incredibly human story,\nbrimming with sad humour and gut\nwrenching tragedy, told through the\nmost innocent of voices. In telling us\nthis simple and incredible story, she\nbrings to life every single injustice\nand pain she rages against. This is\nthe real power of the narrative. It\nnever attempts to anchor the reader\ndown to a particular theme, be it personal tragedy or political angst. It\ncombines so many things and under\nMs Roy\u2019s masterful hand it succeeds\nand leaves the reader with a tapestry of what it is to be human and\nwhat it means to love.\nThis book is certainly centred on\na tragedy, but it is by no means\nReviews in brief\nWestwood\nRbk joined forces with Radio 1 DJ\nTim Westwood on 7 October at our\nstudents Union to promote the latest range of Rbk trainers, known as\nthe DJ collection.

    "content": "Sport sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA star is born!\nEoin O Colgain\nWednesday 19th October brought\nus back to Parliament Hill; a sweeping panorama of London, shower\ndodging in changeable weather,\nfond nostalgia for a seasoned few,\nespecially the soon to be anointed\nDr. Daisley, and wide-eyed looks\nfrom the intrepid but nameless\nFreshmen. It was the first race of\nthe London Colleges\u2019 League series:\na team event spun out over 6 events\nwith several colleges battling it out\nfor second place after St. Mary\u2019s, not\nunlike boring Chelsea, have usually\ntaken the laurels. Not surprising for\nan institution that offers degrees in\nrunning quickly, perspiring, calorie\ncounted diets and stretching! The\nlandscape of last season looks as\nfollows: top three teams for males,\nSt. Mary\u2019s, IC, UCL and for females\nSt. Mary\u2019s, UCL and IC. As you may\nguess, we have a particular soft spot\nfor University College.\nCross-country is a team sport\nwith the first 6 to score in the men\u2019s\nand 3 in the women\u2019s (luckily few for\nus). The league takes us to exciting wildernesses such as Richmond,\nReading and Victoria Park to compete on trails, hills, woodlands and\nroads. Spikes or fell-shoes are the\naccessories of choice, though races\nare also good for getting trainers\nmuddy and thus upping the wearer\u2019s street credentials. Men are\nusually expected to run 5 miles\nwhile women escape with 2.5 miles.\nSomewhere between ten and twelve\ncolleges are represented by both\nmale and female teams in different divisions. Numbers are usually\ngood with Parliament Hill this year\nattracting 99 males and 44 females\nof an assortment shapes, sizes and\nabilities.\nIn the women\u2019s race a HarrietAngharad-Harrietsandwichensured\nthat IC finished 4th in the race stand-ings. Harriet Scott, the star of our\ntitle, had a very composed race and\nled the race from start to finish in a\nvery uncompromisingly strong display of grit. Unfortunately Harriet\nwas such an undiscovered gem that\nwe didn\u2019t even get a photo of her and\npeople in the club are still standing about scratching their heads\nmouthing \u201cHarriet who?\u201d. Hopefully\nwe\u2019ll be able to bring you a picture\nof photogenic Harriet in action in\nthe next race at Richmond Park.\nAngharad Care, a veteran from\nprevious seasons, also had a fine\nrace and seems to have discovered\nsome extra gears to finish a very\nimpressive 7th. Harriet Kirk and\nAnjali Chakraborty also had very\nfine first outings for IC bringing the\ntotal number of women to 4. Without\nthem we would have been looking\nat the disappointing prospect of not\nbeing able to field a women\u2019s team.\nWe applaud them. On a serious note,\nI would like to use this opportunity\nto ask all women with a low resting pulse rate to consider compet-ing. The endorphins can be most\nrewarding and there are many fit\nblokes about who would be delighted to receive a little of their attention over post-race drinks. With one\nof our friendly alcohol fuelled grop-ers away in Germany and the other\none keeping a rather low profile I\ncan vouch for their safety. At the\nmoment, we are just a few women\nshort of a very competitive x-coun-try team and a new golden era of\nwomen\u2019s running at Imperial. It\nmust be stressed that x-country at\nImperial is a very sociable, inclusive\nand friendly experience. Nowhere is\nthis more in evidence than with the\njovial greetings of Chris Mullington.\nChris, bronzed and just back from a\nHawaiian triathlon was far from shy\nin treating everyone to a glimpse\nof his tan-lines by pulling down his\nshorts. If it wasn\u2019t for a girl called\nLisa and her vodka-fuelled drunk-en, and indeed lewd accounts of\nbedroom antics with Chris, we may\nwell be worried sharing the same\nchanging room. A little effeminate\npeacock though he may be, Chris is\nan athlete of the finest caliber and\nwas first IC man home in a very\ncommendable 13th, helped in no\nsmall way by the enigmatic Dave\nX selflessly pacing him through the\nfirst lap and a half. Although Dave\u2019s\nmate Will was trying to get us to buy\nthat the \u201cX\u201d was actually short for\nx-rated necrophilia in the pub later\nthat evening, it turned out on race\nday that the only \u201cX\u201d we could consider was the eXorcism of the ghost\nof one Sebastian Venus from Dave.\nSeb spent much of last season taunting Dave for his race impotency.\nAlthough Dave finished well up the\nrace order, unfortunately Seb has\nbecome an automaton at one of the\nPlease send your sports reports, reviews and comments to\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nCity banks and won\u2019t be coming back\nto play in the mud with us again.\nOf the 25 men who donned a sin-glet (or a vest as the natives call\nthem) for IC, there were many solid\nperformances and hectic sprint fin-ishes. Too many to mention but particularly noteworthy was new club\nhelmsman Tarik Amer, who skipped\naround the course wearing headphones while holding hands with\nhis fellow competitor and girlfriend\nAnjali. Final mention goes to Pete\nDickenson, who gets his name in ink\nfor a recapture of the coveted \u201cKing\nof the Hill\u201d title. Uncontested to the\nsummit, Pete graciously accepted\nthe plaudits of the St. Mary\u2019s runners before gentlemanly stepping\naside to allow them and 72 other\nrunners by in a very charitable dis-play. Dave X had a closer shave last\nyear, when young Irishman Vinnie\nO\u2019Sullivan almost collapsed a lung\nin an effort to shadow Dave to the\ntop, duped into thinking that Dave\nwas some running machine.\nSo just to recap: Imperial were 3rd\nin the men\u2019s and 4th in the women\u2019s.\nAll in all, a concrete start but much\nwork to be done! I promise that\nwe\u2019ll have our cameramen trailing\nHarriet Scott next time for our next\nreport. Hopefully she\u2019ll be a motivation for other women to come and\ncompete. Finally I look forward to\nthe next race and the subsequent\nreport when the pen will be passed,\nand those who have had their toes\ntrampled can exact some revenge.\nBrown on\nSport\nStephen Brown\nSports Editor\nHaving been sent to the wrong pitches by the boys from the aforementioned polytechnic we started play\n15 minutes late. The match started\nwell with IC dominating their obese\nexcuse for a pack at the break down\nand some great breaks from Matt le\nBang, Johnny the Jock and Rob \u2018Odd\nJob\u2019 Gaskell led to us being camped\nin their \u201922. A lucky interception try\nby their off side centre meant that\nthey took the lead. At this point\nSachin \u2018Brown Bullet\u2019 Amin came\non and the dominance continued but\nwe lacked the precision to convert\nthis into points meaning that the\nfirst half ended 7-0 to them.\nThe second half saw Sam, Ben\nand Chrissy G come on. A change in\nthe game plan led to excellent pick\nand goes, particularly from James\nDavies, Sam the fresher and the\nBrown Bullet. This allowed Paul\nTench to beat his man and score\nunder the posts which was converted James \u2018Wilko\u2019 Fletcher. More\npressure led to their hooker being\nsin binned for being an off-side dick-head and the resulting penalty was\nslotted home by \u2018Wilko\u2019 to make the\nfinal score 10-7 to ICURFC Trees.\nOn the afternoon of Wednesday 19th\nOctober the netball club 1st team\nmade their way to King\u2019s College\nsports ground in Berrylands. I don\u2019t\nknow exactly where it is; only that it\u2019s\na long way from South Kensington!\nAfter warming up and having a\nteam talk we were ready to \u201cwin\u201d as\naccording to Jen we had to win as\nshe\u2019d told her friends we were really\ngood (no pressure)!\n\u201cWe were all very\ntired \u2013 but we ener-gised our game and\nput a few in the net\u201d\nThe whistle blew and the first\nquarter began. After a few min-utes, with goals on both sides, we\nstarted settling into the game, getting accustomed to King\u2019s style of\nplay. There were times when the\npassing was a bit erratic and we\nthrew passes away unnecessarily\nbut we slowed down and got a few\ngoals back. When the whistle blew\nfor quarter time we were one goal\ndown but had the next centre pass\nto regain a level score.\nDuring the second quarter we\nraised our game and started communicating better on court. We\nplayed more like a team, our passing became stronger and there were\nsome good interceptions from the\ndefence, some of which we converted into goals. We were ahead as we\nwent into half time.\nOn Tuesday at training we started\nzoning/zone marking for the first\ntime but hadn\u2019t put it into our game\nso far. However it was decided we\nwould try it on King\u2019s first backline\npass. Out on court again for the\nthird quarter and we used the first\navailable opportunity to try out our\nzoning. It was quite interesting but\nnot too successful \u2013 something I\u2019m\nsure we will work on at training!\nUnfortunately we seemed to lose our\nconcentration for a period, throwing\nthe ball away unnecessarily and we\nweren\u2019t converting enough of our\ninterceptions into goals. So we finished the third quarter several goals\ndown.\nPep talk time! We knew that we\nweren\u2019t far behind, and also realised\nwe could win and should win as we\nwere playing very well.\n\u201cThe main thing is\nthat we won and\nare developing as a\nteam\u201d\nThe 4th quarter had a bit of a\nlethargic start (we were all very\ntired) but we energised our game\nand put a few in the net. The last\nquarter was quite intense and none\nof us knew what the score was until\nthe final whistle was blown. It was\n45-44 at the end and I think most of\nthe team thought King\u2019s had won, so\nit was amazing when we found out\nthat the win was ours!\nThe main thing is that we won and\nare developing as a team. We certainly have a few things we need to\npractice at in training (including not\nrunning into the same space \u2013Jen\nand Thea, who we thought might\npass out in the 4th quarter after\na spectacular head-on collision!)\nbut the team looks very promising.\nWatch this space!\nNetball ladies snatch narrow victory\nKing\u2019s College 1sts 44\nImperial College 1sts 45\nHelen Gill\nICSM Netball 1sts 38\nHertfordshire 1sts 30\nKatie Gossage\nThe first BUSA match of the season\nfor ICSM\u2019s first team. New faces\nMachine, Goldilocks and The Wall\njoined our squad as we trekked up\nto Hatfield for a match we did not\nthink we would win. Captain MRSA\nhowever, got us there an hour early\nand we looked a lot more professional than we felt. Hertfordshire\nwere looking small and dumpy after\nthe summer and our spirits began\nto rise. We won the first quarter and\nit became clear to all that Machine\nwas unbeatable scoring every goal.\nShe doesn\u2019t even waste time blink-ing! Second quarter we drew, probably due to the conditions. Indoor\nnetball is not a pretty sight: sweaty,\nsmelly and claustrophobic.

So what?\u201d\nI hear you murmur. The College\nwebsite proudly boasts of the floodlit\nastroturf of which our hockey teams\ntakes full advantage. This is fantas-tic; if you happen to play hockey.\nFor those sportsmen and women\nwho are in either a football or rugby\nsquad Monday night training sessions fail to reach their full potential\nowing to the lack of floodlights. Both\ngroups have to share two semi-lit\ngrass pitches, some of which only\nowe the light they do get to their\nadjacency to the astroturf.\nMore floodlights at Harlington\nwouldprevent attendanceattraining\ndropping off as players become disenchanted with giving up an evening\nfor little or no benefit to their game.\nThis would benefit teams as they\nwould have a fitter, more technically\nproficient squad and would also help\nclubs ailing finances as we would\nhave more paying passengers to\noffset the cost of coach hire.

    "content": "LIVE REVIEWS\nLaurent Garnier has been a serious DJ before I was out of nappies.\nHe was the forerunner in the acid\nhouse explosion as well as leading the world in the exploration of\nthe outer limits of electronic music,\nearning the respect of the earliest\n\u2018godfathers of techno\u2019 in Detroit.\nBeing the first Ambassador for\nthe French house/techno stylee,\nentering the scene well before the\nDaft Punk duo from Paris, his music\ntouched an ever-expanding fan base\nthroughout Europe, creating a whole\nnew French electronic scene. In the\nlate 80\u2019s he was the only Frenchman\nto be playing sets at the legendary\nHacienda superclub in Manchester,\nearning himself the title \u2018Flying DJ\u2019,\nwhile also spending many years\nplaying Europe-wide sets in some\nof the hottest clubs and festivals,\nincluding \u2018Wake Up\u2019 in Paris\u2019 Rex\nClub and also making appearances\non radio shows including his special project at Pedro recordings. His\nefforts have been revered by crit-ics, earning himself the title \u2018Best\nInternational DJ\u2019 on many occa-sions.\nLaurent was up for a mammoth\n8 hour set on Saturday. This was\nno problem for the legendary\nFrenchman; his relentless programming and red-hot mixes provided perpetual electric shocks\nto the dance floor and crazy bass\nlines, turning sober one o\u2019clockers\ninto debauched dance-floor fill-ers. Playing up to his mythical status among admirers he played a\nmash up of every sound around.\nWith appearances from heavy D&B\ntunes, warm old school bass lines\nfrom Common Factor, bouncy electronica Da Beep, menacing and\ndangerous subliminal bleeps with\na huge bass drive from The Angry\nGhost by Hug and even the hot new\ndance track Day Break from the\nindie rocker Daso. During the whole\nset, Laurent never stopped acting\nlike a demented monkey on speed\nbut held a clear connection with the\ncrowd. This was a truly mad set,\nand absolutely deserves a top rating\nfrom Le Ros Bif.\nGeorge X\nMore preview than review this, with\nthe live drum\u2019n\u2019bass act storming\nback to London later this month to\nlaunch their second album - Power\nBallads. Powerful they certainly\nare, pulling the crowd with them in\nall directions from the first beat to\nthe last; getting the crowd to sing\nalong, and huddle up, and perform\ncountless silly finger movements,\nall the while grinning away as if\ntruly electrified. This is a unique live\ndrum\u2019n\u2019bass experience. The live\ndrumming of the exceptionally furious Jungle Drummer overwhelmed\nthe venue and feet of the crowd,\nwhile Andy Waterson\u2019s live double\nbass somehow kept the beat and\nkept it loud. London Elektricity perform without laptops or pre-record-ed material on stage, preferring the\nunpredictability of a group who at\ntimes seem on the verge of exploding out of their own energy, or being\nengulfed by their own lunacy. There\nare moments that make you think\nyou are watching the result of locking up the school remedial class for\nten years in the music room. No\nnatural light, just speed. This tour,\nlike the new record, features BBC\nJazz Vocalist Of The Year Liane\nCarroll, with MC Wrek and Tony\nCarroll taking other vocal duties\nand any ranting opportunities. The\nresult is sometimes beautiful, as on\nThe Strangest Secret In The World,\nand frequently chaotic and confus-ing, as on Different Drum. However,\nthe atmosphere generated is insist-ent, a lightning storm, transforming the drum\u2019n\u2019bass sound into an\nexperience that flows up and down\nas erratically as the umbrellas they\nwave around. \u2018Wired up\u2019 doesn\u2019t\neven begin to describe it.\nSimon Bennett\nOceansize are a band with nothing to prove. They already have a\nloyal fanbase, devotees of the rarer\nkind, who have turned out in force\ntonight. However, an eventful summer with several festival appearanc-es, of a higher profile than they were\npreviously used to, added to the fact\nthat their new album Everyone Into\nPosition contains several potential\nindie radio-friendly hits means this\ncould be their chance to break into\nthe bigger leagues. And don\u2019t they\njust know it.\nSinger/guitarist Mike Vennart\nflings himself about the stage with\nreckless abandon, his \u2018cooler-thanthou\u2019 haircut thrown in hitherto\nunknown directions as he feels the\nfull force of his bands multi-layered\nexplosive force tearing through flesh\nand concrete like a wrecking ball\ncut loose from its chain: \u201cI wanna\ncut you to the bone\u201d \u2013 Meredith.\nThe band tear through such a variety of musical genres - prog rock\nthrough to hardcore via gospel - that\nit sometimes becomes hard to find\na discernable pattern amongst the\nnoises. As the singer notes of their\nwide ranging appeal - \u201cThis one\u2019s for\nthe metalheads\u201d - but beneath the\ntheatrics of his performance and the\nbands sometimes seemingly random mish-mash of styles, they seem\nso confident in themselves that it\nalmost seems like they are asking\nus to trust them on this one. What\nreally impresses about the band\u2019s\nperformance tonight is their ability to never lose the crowds inter-est. Sure, some of the older punters\nstanding at the back, enjoying the\nrefreshing air-con, over-priced pint\nin hand, may take time during the\nquieter moments of the show to\ndiscuss how Oceansize are the best\nthing since sliced bread, but those\nof us here to appreciate the music\nremain entranced throughout.\nLove, joy, pain, fear, hope. These\nare the emotions that the band and\nthe crowd experience as one, bound\ntogether by the music, which as\nmuch as I would like it not to be,\ncan\u2019t help but feel slightly famil-iar. Watching Mike wrestle with his\nguitar behind his head as though\nit were a venomous snake inches\naway from striking, while entertaining enough, seems a little too\nlike the onstage antics of one (Sir)\nMatt Bellamy. While he may not\nhave reached the Queen\u2019s ears\nyet, there is not doubt in mine that\nMuse have been crucial in defining Oceansize\u2019s sound, which comes\nacross as a more human and less\n\u2018space opera\u2019 Muse. This impression\nis not helped one bit by the presence of one Dominic Howard, the\ndrummer with the aforementioned\nspace-rock gods, who hangs around\nafter the show willingly signing autographs and having his picture taken\nwith fans. Let\u2019s hope he spreads\nthe word to Sir Bellamy about the\nexciting new avenues down which\nOceansize have taken the familiar\nMuse sound so that their currently-in-development fourth LP can be all\nthe better for it.\nVerbal communication by the band\nis kept to a minimum (although\nfrontman Mike Vennart does invite\nthe crowd to come and get pissed\nwith them at a local boozer), but\nthis doesn\u2019t seem to bother anyone\nas the music speaks so personally\nto everyone there. The band end\nwith finale to end all finales, building a song up for what seems like\nan eternity until they are all on the\npoint of collapse, then each taking\na bow and leaving to a rapturous\napplause one by one until finally all\nthat is left is a pulsating whine of\nhigh pitched static. Upon leaving\nthe venue, and realising the whine is\nstill going \u2013 in my ears \u2013 we are left\nwith a feeling that tonight we witnessed something oh-so-special, but\nsomehow indescribable, so I urge\nto seek these musical masters out\nfor yourselves and discover the joys\nwhich lie within.\nToby Prudden\nA change of pace\nThis week, live d\u2019n\u2019b and an awe-inspiring set from the legendary Laurent Garnier \ufb01ll these hallowed pages, as well as gobbets of praise for Oceansize\u2019s live show\nmusic music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nOceansize - you\u2019d cross the street if you saw them coming.\n8\nfelix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk Thursday 27 October 2005\nLaurent Garnier\nThe End\nHHHHH\nOceansize\nIslington Academy\nHHHHI\nLondon Elektricity\nBristol Fiddlers\nHHHHI\nLondon Elektricity - Tony Carroll.\n\n"

    "content": "SCIENCE science.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n7\nfelix\nThursday 27 November 2005 www.felixonline.co.uk\nEvery summer Imperial sends five\nor so students across the Atlantic to\nthe University of Delaware on the\neast coast of the United States, as\npart of the Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Program (UROP). I\nwas one of the fortunate few to have\nthis experience \u2013 a chance to have\na stab at some real-world scientific\nresearch while having a lot of fun.\nThe University of Delaware is situated on a beautiful, green campus\na short drive away from New York\nCity, Philadelphia, Washington, DC\nand the seaside. Even though the\nexchange takes place over 8 to 9\nweeks during the summer months,\nthere is never a lack of activity, and\ntrips are organised to all of the above\nplaces. To complement this, campus\nlife is lively \u2013 there are hundreds of\nAmerican students still on campus,\ncarrying out similar research place-ments, so there are always parties\nto go to, and plenty of poker to play.\nThe campus surrounds Main\nStreet, the place to be when in\nNewark, DE, and is home to a variety of bars and eateries. It\u2019s also\na short drive away from the malls,\nproviding ample opportunity to rake\nin the benefits of the \u2018strength\u2019 of the\nUS dollar.\nDuring the first seven weeks, I\nstayed on campus in student dorms\nand got to meet a variety of strange\nbut extremely friendly people,\nincluding my American roommate,\nAlfred Gordon Smith III. Despite his\nremarkably silly name, AGSIII did\nhave a beach house in New Jersey,\nwater-skis, and a family connected\nto government, so there were a few\nthings to benefit from (in addition to\njust meeting a nice person!).\nDon\u2019t forget that there is some\nexciting project work to be done\nas well. There is a wide variety of\nprojects available, with work varying\ndepending on your choice. You may\nwork closely with a research group\nor have your own project. I chose\nto do mine in a condensed matter physics group, playing around\nwith some helium theory. Whatever\nplacement you choose, there will\nalways be plenty of help and advice\navailable and a chance to carry out\nsome quality research.\nPerhaps the best cultural experience was the two-week home-stay, where I got room and board\nwith a local American family. The\nworst was possibly the distinct lack\nof my mate, Marmite; I strongly\nadvise that you take a jar with you.\nPersonal issues aside, the exchange\nis an excellent opportunity for extra\ntravel, as the placement takes up\nonly the first two months of the sum-mer, leaving you free to explore on\nthe cheap.\nThe experience is highly recommended by each and every one of us\nwho went!\nBenjamin Withers\nTo find out more, come to the\npresentation in Lecture Theatre 3\non Level 1 of the Blackett\nLaboratory (Physics) at 13.10pm,\nTuesday 8 November.\nBy the time you read this, we will\nalready have put a satellite into\norbit.\nToday, 27 October, at 07:52:26\n(BST), SSETI-Express has been\nlaunched into orbit by a Cosmos\nrocket from Plesetsk, Russia, in\nthe DMC-3 flight of Surrey Satellite\nTechnology.\nSSETI-Express is a low Earth\norbit (LEO) spacecraft, which\nweighs 62 kg and has the approximate shape and size of a washing\nmachine. It is the first satellite in\norbit, which has been designed,\nbuilt and tested entirely by university students across Europe.\nSSETI-Express is an educational\nmission. Beyond its technological\ndevelopments, its most important\npurpose belongs down on Earth:\nthe students behind it. It has\nencouraged, motivated and trained\nstudents across Europe in a real\naerospace project. How many of\nyou will have put a satellite in orbit\nbefore you graduate?\nBesides this, SSETI-Express\nalso has physical payloads and\nobjectives. It will deploy CubeSat\npicosatellites developed by three\ndifferent universities (in Norway,\nCanada and Japan), take pictures\nof the Earth and test hardware and\ntechnology that will be used in our\nnext satellites. It also involves the\nradio amateur community in the\ndownlink of the data and, once its\nnominal mission is over, it will act\nas a transponder for them.\nSSETI-Express is a rarity in the\nspace field, not only because it has\nbeen entirely done by students.\nIt has had a record development\ntime of only 18 months from kickoff to flight readiness review, which\nprobably makes it the fastest\nspacecraft design and construction project ever, hence the name\n\u201cExpress\u201d. Its cost contributes to\nits rarity: by using donated materi-als, equipment and expertise (from\nESA, universities and industry),\nthe total hardware expenditure by\nESA\u2019s Education Department has\nbeen kept below 100,000 euros.\nAs with all space projects, ours\nhasn\u2019t followed an easy path to\nlaunch. The first launch was\nscheduled for 25 August. It suffered a month delay due to minor\nproblems with the main passenger\nof the flight. After a 3 day delay in\nSeptember, it was delayed again\nfor another month, only 5 days\nbefore launch, due to compatibility\nproblems. Finally, the launch was\nset for today, and all looks good as\nI\u2019m writing this, D-day minus 5. If\nthe weather turns out to be hor-rible, the launch will be postponed\nuntil tomorrow. But a good thing\nabout launching with Russia is that\ntheir rockets are tougher, and the\nweather has to be truly horrible to\npostpone the launch for one day.\nThe launch of SSETI-Express\nhas only been our first milestone.\nOur second project, the European\nStudent Earth Orbiter (ESEO)\nis currently in its design phase.\nThe Imperial College team is an\nactive member, being in charge\nof the Assembly, Integration and\nVerification (AIV) of the satellite.\nOur third project, the European\nStudent Moon Orbiter (ESMO) is\nundergoing feasibility studies now,\nand we have thoughts of a fourth\nmission, a Moon Rover.\nWe hope the launch today will\ngive our project a boost in terms of\nnot only students interested in the\nproject, but also opinions on our\nwork. The scientific community\nand the public have been watching us for some time now and are\nnot yet sure how we manage to do\nit. We astonish space professionals by continuing a project with\nno funding to speak of, no recognized expertise and almost never\nmeeting the other members face\nto face. Indeed, we do this and a\ndegree at the same time, while\nthe professionals keep up with us\nbecause it\u2019s their full time job.\nIf you are lucky enough to\nhave picked this issue today in\nthe morning (or, even better,\nWednesday night as you leave\nthe Union), you are still in time\nto come see our launch! The live\ntransmission starts at 7.30am in\nthe Blackett Laboratory, Level 8\nCommon Room, and there will be\nrepeats of the launch at 10.00am\nand 12.00am in the Union building\n(Beit Quad), Seminar Room 1.\nCristina Rodriguez Trobajo\nSSETI Team Coordinator\nFor more information about\nSSETI, visit www.sseti.net or\ne-mail sseti@imperial.ac.uk\nSSETI-Express Launch Today\nA summer of science in America\nBenjamin (far right), along with Chi Hui Lim, Steven Johnson, Julia Li (left to right), and Elena Phoka\n(missing), was lucky to be selected for a two-month research placement at the University of Delaware.\nWashing machine or satellite?
