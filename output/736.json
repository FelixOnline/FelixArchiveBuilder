    "content": "UGM Blues\nOnly 70 students attended\nthe IC Results U GM In the\nGreat Hall last Thursday.\nThe dismal turnout was due\nin part to the clash with the\nGuilds election U GM, held\nin Mech Eng 220. U GM Chairman Chris Hendy\nread out a letter of apology\nfrom Guilds President\nRoger Preece. Mr Preece\nexplained that the situation\nwas unavoidable as Guilds\nhad been unable to book a room at any other time.\nThe main business of the\nmeeting was the ratification\nand election of next year's non sabbatical Union\nOfficers. Returned\nunopposed were Dan\nPhillips (Ents Chairman),\nMark Cottle (External\nAffairs Officer), Alan Rose\n(Internal Services Officer),\nMan Tai Tseung (Rag\nChairman) and Pete Wilson\n(Welfare Officer). Mr Rose,\nwho is currently Internal\nServices Committee\nChairman, had proposed a by-law change such that\nthe title of his job be\naltered. Mr Rose felt that\nUnion services had\nexpanded sufficiently for\nthe post to merit the\nstanding of a Union Officer,\nrather than a chairman of a subcommittee of ICU\nCouncil. The first reading\nof the necessary by-law\nchanges was accepted\nwithout objection.\nElections were held for\nthe posts of U GM chairman\nand Academic Affairs\nOfficer. Hugh Southey,\nproposed by Grenville\nManuel, was elected as\nnext year'sU GM Chairman.\nMr Southey said that much\nmore work had to be put\ninto promoting UGM's, and\nthat meetings should be\nmade relevant to ordinary\nstudents. Charles Brereton,\nproposed by Alan Rose,\nwas elected as A AO. Mr\nBrereton stressed the need\nfor more involvement from\nDep Reps in Academic\nAffairs.\nEarlier in the meeting a motion rec commending that the by-laws be altered\nso that only women\nstudents be allowed to vote\nin the election of the\nWomen's Officer was\npassed without oj ect ion. The motion, proposed by\nICU President-elect and\ncurrent Women's Officer,\nChristine Taig, was brought\nforward on the agenda\nfollowing acceptance of a pro dec ural motion.\nAll of the sabbatical\nofficers reports were read\nby ICU Hon Sec Quentin\nFontana, owing to the\nabsence of President Carl\nBurgess, who was\nattending INCOST in .\nBelgium, and Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston\nwho was busy running his\ncampaign for UL U President. There was some\ndiscussion of the College's proposals for a new\ndisciplinary procedure.\nThese include a clause\nallowing a student's punishment to be increased\nif he or she appeals against\na decision. IC Union has\nmade known its objection\nto this, though Mr Fontana\npointed out that this clause\nexists in the current\ndisciplinary procedure.\nThe meeting was closed\nbefore discussion of the\nmotion on Barclays Bank,\nwhen quorum was\nsuccessfully chall eng d by\nJohn Ransom.\nPictured above is the cast of Dramsoc's sell-out\nproduction of Kennedy's Children by Robert Patrick. From\nleft to right are Tessa Hoxey, Sam Duerden, Lance\nHolland, Nobber, Liz Holford, and Mike Foulds. Review\npage 8.\nNo Blood\nFor Jackie\nToday's RCS blood\ndonation has been\ncancelled. RCS VicePresident Jackie Peirce\ncalled off the group\ndonation two weeks ago\nwhen it proved impossible\nto find a suitable room. The\norganisers had intended to\nuse the Southside gym for\nthe donations and had\noriginally been unable to\ncome to College before mid\nJune. Miss Peirce was later\ncontacted and told that\nMarch 19 was a possible\ndate due to a cancellation.\nUnfortunately she was\nunable to book the gym for\nthe full day on March 19.\nSuccess On\nA Plate\nLadies Hockey won the\nULU Plate final on Sunday\nat Motspur Park. They beat\nWye College 1-0 after extra\ntime. The goal was scored\nby Sarah Hodgson. A full\nreport is on the sports\npage.\nRoyle\nWinner\nDuncan Royle of Elec Eng\n3 is the new Guilds\nPresident. Simon Childs\nwas elected Vice-President\nand Ann Driver was\nunopposed as Hon Sec.\nAfter a meeting on\nMonday the new Executive\nissued a statement saying\nthat they intend to increase\nstudent involvement in\nGuilds by making funds\navailable for students to\norganise their own social\nevents. They also intend to\ninstitute a system of office\nhours so that students can\ncome and see them, and to\nmake the Guilds Office\nmore friendly and open.\nMembers of the new\nExecutive commented that\nnext year looked like being\na good year for Guilds and\nthat they had loads of ideas\nfor the Union.\nThe other new members\nof Guilds Executive are\nVanessa Palmer, Hugh\nSouthey, Dave Pugh and\nHelen Morgan who are\nrespectively HJT, A AO, Ents Officer and Old\nCentralians Rep.\nCollection\nComplete\nA total of \u00a31267 has been\nraised for relatives of the\nman who was killed in the\nChemistry Department's pater-noster lift two weeks\nago.\nJohn James of Estates,\nwho organised the\ncollection, told FELIX that a wreath had been sent on\nbehalf of all the\ncontributors. He added that\nthe man's family had\nexpressed their\nappreciation to members of\nthe College.\nWaiting\nAppeal\nCollege are still awaiting\nnews of a possible appeal\nby architects Norman and\nDawburn, following the\nHigh Court award of\n\u00a3850,000 damages five\nweeks ago. The fourteen\nday 'stay of execution'\ngranted by judge David\nSmout QC, had now\nexpired, and hence no\nappeal can be made\nagainst the damages\nawarded to College. Estates\nSecretary Don Clark told\nFELIX that an appeal\nagainst the main decision\nwas still possible, however.\nPerry\nPresident\nRob Perry is the new\nPresident of RSMU for the\n1986-87 session. Mr Perry\nwas returned unopposed at\nthe Mines elections U GM on Tuesday. Bridget\nBenfield was also\nunopposed for the post of\nthe Vice-President. The\nposition of Hon Sec was\ncontested between Ewan\nSim and Andy Carrie. Mr\nSim won the election by 43\nvotes to 35.\nBurgess In\nBelgium\nICU President Carl Burgess\nand Guilds A AO Luke\nWalker went to INCOST\n1986, the International\nConference of Students of\nScience and Technology, in\nGhent, Belgium, last week.\nA full report will appear in\nthe first FELIX of next term.\n24 Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "I Conservative Education Policy\nHi\na The AUT strike at the start of this term was supported by many IC students and staff. FELIX backed\nthe strike with a special highlighting government education costs. Conservative Society Chairman\nJohn Martin wrote to FELIX complaining about biased coverage. HE now outlines why he thinks the\ngovernment is correct....\nSchool Policy\nThe false prophets of the\n60s have gravely damaged\nBristish Education. Instead\nof concerning themselves\nwith standards and skills,\nexcellence, diversity and\nchoice, emphasis has been\nplaced on equality,\nuniformity and central\nplanning. The present\ngovernment is pledged to\nundo the damage caused\nby these misconceptions.\nHuge amounts of\ntaxpayers' and rate payers' money continue to be\nspent-more than ever\nbefore on each student,\neven allowing for inflation,\nbut the Government has\nplaced emphasis on\nOUTPUT rather than\nINPUT, on the efficient use\nof resources rather than\nfruitless spending, and on\nthe skill shown by teachers\nand acquired by students\nrather than on grandiose\nsocial aspirations.\nAs Conservatives we look\nforward to the free play of\nmarket forces in education,\nto the benefit of the quality\nof the education students\nreceive; which will involve are struct ing of the\ntraditional nationalized\neducation service. The last\nLabour administration\nimposed comprehensives\nupon an often unwilling\npopulation as the only form\nof maintained secondary\neducation. Results in the\ncombined secondary\nmodern/grammar school\nsystem outshone those in\nthe new system, and the\ncase for the grammar\nschools was presented\nfrom all quarters. The\nLabour Party remain\ndedicated to imposing a system of pure\ncomprehensive schools:\nthey will ban all\nindependent, grammar and\nchurch schools. David\nOwen and Shirley Williams\nalso require the desecration\nof the pillars of our\neducation system.\nThe 1980 Education Act\nprovided for the first time\never, the parents' right to\nexpress a preference for\nthe school in which they\nwished their children to be\neducated. Full information\nabout the range of schools\navailable must be given to\nparents, and the ability to\nchoose an independant\nschool of quality is given\nvia the enormously\nsuccessful Assisted Places\nScheme. In addition,\nparents are now to be given\na powerful voice on the\ngoverning body of each\nschool, with real control\nover the running of the\nschool and spending of\nmoney.\nReform in schools and\nthe reintroduction of the\nvalues of excellence and\nachievement lies in several\ndirections. In order for\nschools to become more\naccountable, the\nperformance of teachers is\nunder review. Teaching\nstandards are dependent\nupon the quality and\ncommitment of teachers.\nThe government aims to\nraise the quality of the\nteaching profession\nthrough better selection of\ncandidates for teacher\ntraining, improvement of\ninitial training courses and\nin-service training, and a career structure which will\nimprove the professional\nstanding of the individual\nteacher.\nGrants or Loans\n'No students anywhere in\nthe world are treated more\ngenerously than British\nstudents. In Sweden and\nJapan they would receive\nloans, and in many other\ncountries they would\nreceive part loans and part\n\u2022grants.'\nMrs Thatcher\nIt has been widely\nclaimed by Conservative\nstudents, myself included,\nthat it is time for students\nto stop sponging from the\nhard-pressed taxpayer,\nand take financial\nresponsibility for the\neducation from which we\nhope to gain. The\nproposals made by Sir\nKeith Joseph last year\nwould have gone some way\ntowards initiating a part\nloans, part grants system,\nwhich in time would have\nreleased large amounts of\ntaxpayers money. This\nwould have been returned\ninto the economy, and\nwould, no doubt, have\nreleased more money for\nother areas of education.\nPublic hysteria, in reso nse to left-wing propaganda\nCOMPARISON OF UK STUDENT SUPPORT SYSTEM WITH THOSE IN\nOTHER EC MEMBER COUNTRIES( AND JAPAN AND THE USA) COUNTRY SYSTEM% OF STUDENTS MAXIMUM AVERAGE SUPPORTED GRANT AVAILABLE GRANT Belgium Grants45% CI 390 C480\nDenmark Grants& Loans n.a.C1520 C740 France Grants& Loans11.6% C I000n. a Greece Loans n.a.

UK elsewhere rate of grant in 1 9 8 4 / 8 5 was \u00a31 7 7 5\nforced a partial break-down, although the\ngovernment has been\nforced to bring about cuts\nin financial support to\nstudents in other areas.\nThere is nothing new\nabout loans, as can be seen\nfrom the statistics above,\nand in fact the issue\ndeserves greater respect\nthan you may previously\nhave given it. The vast\nmajority of tax-payers\nfooting the bill for our\neducation have received no\nsuch privilege nor will their\nchildren. Why should they\nsub sid is e our privileged\nstate? Moverover, Britain is\na substantial loser when\nconsidering the\nconsiderable cost of\neducating students who\nhave no intention of\nremaining in Britain after\ngraduating. Is it wrong to\nto suggest that the bill for\neducation in such\ncircumstances should\nclearly lie at the feet of the\nin divi u dals, as should the\nbill for our own education.\nThe most effective way of\nbringing about these\nreforms would have been to\nsupport Sir Keith's proposals. Instead,\nstudents may be forced\ninto borrowing money to\nsub sid is e their education\non the private market.\nAs well as the generosity\nof the government in the\ngrant area at the moment, it\nshould be remembered that\nthere is also national\nconscription in many of\nthose countries with which\nBritain is compared, a constraint without which it\nwould be relatively easy to\nrepay ones' loan. The\nburden would also have\nbeen reduced by a tax-dec uc table repayment\nscheme.\nThe current 'cuts' which\nare more accurately small\nincreases in the level of the\nstudent grants, and\nproposals to cut the\nbenefits previously given to\nstudents are designed to\nbring us into line with our\ninternational competitors,\nand force students to take\nadvantage of the rapidly\nexpanding part-time job\nmarket. Knock them at the\nperil of your tax-bill in ten\nyears time, and support\nthem in the proud\nknowledge that it is your\nduty to the tax-payer you\nwill be after leaving\nCollege.\n1C Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

The Editor of FELIX is Hugh Southey and The Business\nManager is J Martin Taylor. Copyright FELIX 1986. ISSN 1040-0711.\nPreece\nDefended\nDear Hugh,\nIt is with strong feeling that\nwe seek to balance the\nopinions you put forward in\nyour last editorial\nconcerning the\nperformance of C& GU this\nyear, and, in particular y, its\nPresident, Roger Preece,\nwhilst an editorial is\ncertainly the place to\npresent your opinions, your\ncomments were so vague\nand un spec fic that they\nmerely contributed to a slur.\nThe Exec of C& GU has\nsought to lessen the 'hack-orientated' image that has\nafflicted Guilds Union in\nthe past, certainly in the\ntime we have been at\ncollege. The situation\ncannot be completely\nremedied in one year, but it\nseems to us, as ordinary\nmembers of Guilds, that\nthings have improved, and\nwe hope that the progress\n[I continues next year, and\nsubsequently.\nClearly, not every event\nor idea has been model of\nperfect organisation\n(Carnival seems an obvious\ncandidate for change\nthough this year's problems\nwere more the culmination\nof a trend, than some one-off due to lack of\nexperience). But it seems\nquite unjust to claim that\nGuilds has been run less\neffectively than the other\n| CC Us this year. The\nperformance of ICU's sabbatical officers has been\na far more justifiable cause\nof concern.\nIn conclusion, we hope\nthat you will produce some\nmore cogent and better\nprepared argue ment s next\nyear in your role as Guilds\nA AO! Yours sincerely,\nJulian Fagandini\nDouglas Earl\nAccording\nto Luke\nDear Hugh,\nIt is difficult for any person\nwho acts as a representative to point to\nparticular developments for\nwhich he or she is\npersonally, directly and\nindividually responsible, as\nI am sure Pete Wilson\nappreciates. What I seek to\ndo is to put forward a student view on the issues\nraised at the College\ncommittees I attended.\nWhile I agree that this may\nsound to be reacting rather\nthan initiating discussion it\nis not infrequent for\nstudent representatives to\nraise issues that they wish\nto see discussed.\nI do not, therefore,\napologise*for not pointing\nto any specific items as my\nown achi ev men ts.I rely\nheavily on the Dep Reps\nand Ac Reps, who are more\ndirectly concerned with\nissues within departments\nsuch as irrelevant courses\nand lecturers who can't lecture. This year I have\nattended most staff/student\ncommittees, though I must\nstress-the importance of\nindividual unsatisfied\nstudents indicating their\nfeelings or their feelings to\ntheir Ac Reps, so that\naction can be taken.\nI 'operate' mostly on\ncollege-level committees\nlooking at college-wide\nissues, and report to my\nconstituents primarily\nthrough Guildsheet, though\nI also present a fairly\nextensive report on my\nact ivies to the C& GAc Reps and Dep Reps under\nthe auspices of City and\nGuilds Union Academic\nAffairs Committee. I have\non occasion been tempted\nto suspect that the college\nsometimes uses\ncommittees, and student\nques it on n aires, etc, to\n'keep the students quiet';\nbut my fears have been\nallayed by the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee which has\nrecently been established\nto address the problems\nexperienced in the college\nin undergraduate teaching\ngenerally. I hope to see a better deal for\nundergraduate students in\nthis college (meaning C&G perhaps more than IC in\ngeneral), as a rather\ndissatisfied student myself.\nI believe that, at last, there\nare signs that progress will\nbe made.\nI trust that if Pete, or\nanyone else, wishes to\ndiscuss this further, they\nwill approach me (or my\nsuccessor in office\u2014that's you Hugh!) directly.\nYours\nLuke Walker\nAcademic Affairs Officer\nAccording\nto John\nDear Hugh,\nAlthough I have never\nchallenged the quorum at aUG M, today I would have\nbeen prepared to because I did not feel that those\npresent represented a fair\ncross-section of Imperial\nCollege Students to pass\npolicy on the issue of\nboycotting Barclays. After\nthe meeting I was\nchallenged for not having\ncalled 'quorum' at the start\nof the meeting by a group\nof people who had voted to\npass the motion. These\npe. ale were criticising the\ndecency of the guy who\ncalled quorum, and others,\nwho had no wish to disrupt\nthe running of the union's affairs.\nIn return for this decency\nthe man who made the\nchallenge was called a 'bastard' and myself a 'fascist'. I am sure that they\nwould join me in\ncondemning this mindless,\npathetic cause. Those who\nresort to it show the\nobvious insecurity of their\nown philosophy by virtue of\nthe fact that they have\nnothing more intelligent to\nsay.\nSecondly, I make no\nattempt to hide the\nmoderate views which, I believe, will be far more\nbeneficial for the whole of\nSouth Africa. Some would\nwish to force a bloody\nrevolution in South Africa.\nIf this occurs, we condemn\nthousands of people to\nviolent death. And\nafterwards, can we\nguarantee a more\nrepresentative, less brutal\nform of government? Not if\nthe rest of African\ncountries which have been\nin the same situation are\nused in comparison.\nThe only way forward is\nto welcome the far-reaching, though\ninsufficient reforms already\nin tia ted by the South Africa\nadministration. We must\nrespect the views of Bishop\nTutu and Chief Buthelezi\nand shelve the idea of\neconomic sant ions. It is our\nduty to condemn apartheid,\nbut pre s eve the highest\nblack standard of living in\nAfrica, and our social,\ncultural and economic links\nwith SA to encourage the\ncountry to take the right\nsteps towards a better\nfuture.\nThe mistakes made in\nnumerous countries across\nAfrica need not be echoed.\nThe people of S A have got\na lot to gain and lot to\nlose. In the context of SA,\nthe present administration\nis the most 'moderate' for a long time and appears to\nbe dedicated to reform. The\npro posit on of sanctions\nwhich has been rejected by\nthe United States and\nsuspended by the\nCommonwealth pending\nsigns of reform is one\nwhich will only he nder implementation of reform\nand anger the\nadministration who are\ntrying to bring it about. At\nth same time its effect upon\nSouth Africa would be\nminimal compared with the\neffects upon the Southern\nAfrica countries of\nLesthoso, Swaziland,\nMozambique, Malawi,\nZimbabwe, Zambia, Zaire,\nAngola, SWA and\nBotswana.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Martin\nWednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

The\nobjective was to reach\nYoster airfield from our\nbase at Laseham.\nJohn Towill won both\nballots for choice of glider\nand for launching and so\nhe had climbed to quite a height in the Capstan\nbefore everyone else was\nlaunched and the race\ncould begin. This gave him\nquite a lead, but Pete\nPlackard, the king of\nsoaring, had fetched up\nwith the Cadet glider, and\nso with his magical ability\nto find thermals, Pete gave\nJohn a good chase.\nFurther back, Andy\nWinterton was just\nmanaging to stay ahead of\nTony Shaw, Simon Smith\nand Edmund Field. As the\nsun climbed higher and the\nthermals grew stronger, the\nhandicap of Edmund's Nimbus began to show and\nhe gradually fell back to\njoin the group hacking\nalong in the rear,\ndesperately trying to get\nthe most out of their old\nLibelles, LS4s and ASW19s.\nHowever time and weather\nturned against this last\ngroup. James Burdett\nfound a e ported15 knots of\nsink and arrived at 200 feet\nwith all the fields below too\nsmall to land in.\nFortunately, he spot eda small airfield in the\ndistance to land, and the\nlocal flying enthusiasts at\nBrize Norton made him\nvery welcome. The others\nof this of this group all had\nto land out, apart from\nEdmund, who managed to\nreach the Malvern Hills,\nclimb on an up draught and\ncruise the rest of the way,\narriving shortly after dark.\nThis event was enjoyed\nby all and was good\npractice for this year's National Universities Finals\nwhich are to be held near\nto John O 'Groats in\nScotland.\nDancing\nThe last month has seen\nthe two big competitions\nfor university dancers. On\nFebruary 14th Valentines\nDay, there was the\nSouthern Universites\ncompetition, held this year\nin Walthamstow.\nThe A team, consisting\nmainly of the old lags did\nwell individually but Were\nnot quite able to win the\nteam trophy. Chris Yates\nand Jill Barrett retained\ntheir Waltz title and Neil\nMcCluskey and Shirley\nBrown took the Jive title.\nPaul Jeremaes and\nMargaret Adams put up a fine performance to come\nsecond in the Cha Cha Cha\ncompetition and quite\nremarkably Jeff Morris ar d Sara Holmes-Woodhead,\nmere beginners at\nChristmas, were semifinalist in the Quickstep.\nThis enable us to come\nsecond overall behind the\nstrong Oxford team.\nThe B team made up\nentirely of beginners,\nnamely John Burke and Liz\nQuarterman, Dave Willis\nand Lisa Sale, Sharad\nSomany and Ruth\nSteedmand and Dave\nBarker and Gill Knowles\ndid themselves proud,\nespecially John and Liz\nwho took the news comers Waltz award.\nWith these results behind\nus the A team, not resting\non their laurels, carried on\nwith the endless practice\nnecessary in preparation\nfor the Intervarsity\ncompetition\nThis time, having\ntravelled to the De Montfort\nHall in Leicester, we did it\nall again but better. Chris\nand Jill again retained their\ntitle and Neil and Shirley\npicked up a new one, along\nwith Paul and Margaret this\ntime. However, though we\nwon three out of the four\ndances, the controversial\nnew scoring system only\nallowed us to come third as\na team. Many thanks are\ndue to Jeff and Sara for\ndancing the Quickstep even\nthough Sara had a badly\nsprained ankle, without\nthem we would have come\nmuch much lower.\nAs well as the team\ncompetitions there was\nconsiderable success in the\nmore hotly contested open\ncompetitions. Chris and Jill\nwon the Foxtrot with Paul\nand Shirley reaching the\nsemi-final. In the PasoDoble Paul and Margaret\ncame fifth with Neil and\nShirley reaching the semi-final. Jeff and Sara\nmanaged the semi-final in\nthe very acrobatic and\nexhausting Rock'n 'Roll\ncompetition.\nMany thanks are of\ncourse due to all our\ntrainers and to the club\nmembers for their continual\nsupport and\nencouragement over the\nyear.\nNUS\nIn case you've had your\nhead buried in a fire bucket\nfor a few years, a word in\nyour ear: you're not a member of the National\nunion of Students. Nobody\nat Imperial is, because IC\nUnion d is affiliated eight\nyears ago. As a result,\nyou're missing out on the\nNational Union's services to\naffiliated Unions-lobbying\nand campaigning about our\ngrants, housing and other\nwelfare rights; pressure for\nthe maintenance and\nimprovement of educational\nfacilities, better training for\nlecturers and so on; legal\nadvice; financial, welfare\nand other research; and\ntraining for our Union\nofficers-nobody can say\nthat couldn't be better.\nWhat ever your politics,\nor even if you take no\ninterest in party pol tics, it\ncan't be denied that\neducation's going through\na pretty thin time\u2014cuts\nand, in London particularly,\nmergers, have left a daunt ng prospect for any\nof your younger sisters nd\nbrothers thinking of\nuniversity about now. Their\nstandard of living if they do\nbecome students isn't much more attractive,\nconsidering the fall in the\nvalue of grants (in real\nterms, that value has\ndropped by 17% since 79)\nand the proposal to remove\nstudents from the housing\nbenefit system.\nBut, I hear you cry,\nsurely students have little\npower to influence\ngovernment decisions\nanyway? That may be so,\nbut the fact is that, when\nstudents are consulted, it's through the NUS\u2014it's just\nplain stupid not to have a share in what influence\nstudents do have, and now\nis the crucial time to do it.\nAs you may have read in\nFELIX, students at K QC( the merger of Kings,\nQueen Elizabeth and\nChelsea Colleges) and\nUniversity College have\ncome to the same\nconclusion. Soon you're\ngoing to be bombarded\nwith publicity from both\npro- and anti- NUS lobbies\nat IC; don't just fall back on\nthe bigotry that's been\nhanded down to you, but\nlisten to the arguments and\ndecide for yourself.\nPefe Hobbis\nCycling\nMartin Farrow was still in\nbed when seven of us set\noff for Box Hill last Sunday.\nNo sooner had we got out\nof Putney than Andrew\ncomplained of a creaking\nbottom bracket and went\nback home. The rest of us\npedalled merrily onwards\nalong the A24, and then on\nup Box Hill. Admiring the\nview of the Downs, we\ndescended pretty rapidly\nand then got split up when\nsome of us took a wrong\nturning. Undaunted, we\narrived back in London at\nabout 1.30pm. This Saturday, we again\ntravel to Essex to ride a10 mile TT. Two members are\nalso travelling to Hull on\nSunday to compete in the\nNational Student 10-mile\nchampionship. Good luck\nto all riders.\n22 Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "The Future of Higher Education\nThe future of Higher\nEducation has now become\nthe subject of detailed\ndiscussion following the\npublication of the\nGovernment's Green paper\n'The Development of\nHigher Education in the\n1990s'. The proposals in\nthis document are designed\nto enable a higher\nproportion of young people\nto go on to universities and\npolytechnics; to provide the\ncountry with more\ngraduates in science and\nengineering; and to\nencourage more private\nsources of finance for\nhigher education.\nThe AUT, committee of\nVice-Chancellers and\nPrincipals, and UGC have\nall foretold 'chaos',\nexpressed 'grave concern'\nand speak of 'irreparable\ndamage'. The story they tell\nis of how 'The golden age\nof university expansion was\nturned into the dark age at\nthe stroke of a pen'. The\nfacts can be briefly told.\nOver the next five years,\nthe un vise r sites are likely to\nlose ten per cent of their\nincome from the\ngovernment. The\npolytechnics and big public\nsector colleges will be\nrequired to teach more\nstudents with the same\nresources. A shift from\ncostly university to\npractical poly s against a background of economic\ndecline and a drastic fall in\nthe number of 18-19 year\nolds has already occured.\nThe AUT's interest is\nclear: they are strictly self-serving. The vice-chancellors have called\n'Wolf!' so often that they\ncannot be take seriously.\nThe UGC only speaks of 'A defeatist approach'. The\nfactors are clearly\nexplained by demography.\nA sharp decline in the\nbirth-rate for the 60s onwards will result in a33% fall in the number of 18-19\nyear olds in the population\nbetween 1984 and 1996.\nFurther, two decades of\nun precede ted expansion\npost-Robbins have led to\nan in eff i cie net unproductive\nsystem:\n'To pretend that the effect\nof 20 years of only loosely\ncontrolled development has\nleft us with the best of all\npossible systems, needing\nonly constant injection of\nmoney to keep it in perfect\ncondition, would be a mistake'\nSir Keith Joseph\nThe Vice-Chancellors reply\nto the Green Paper\ndeclared that 'any greater\nemphasis on science and\ntechnology will become\nimpossible without wilful\ndamage to other necessary\nsections of the university\ncommunity...', but a third\nclass polytechnic electrical\nengineering is more likely\nto find a job than a first\nclass university\nsociologist, english, history,\nart and design, psychology\nand sociology graduates\nhave higher unemployment\nrate than the National\nAverage. Are we to ignore\nthese figures?\nThe AUT claim that\nreduced government\nspending will mean that\nHigher Education will be\nyears of 'savage cuts' there\nare more students in higher\neducation than ever before\nand 60 000 more than in\n1979, and even after the\nsubstantial fall in student\nnumbers in the 1990s, their\nwill still be places for a higher proportion of young\npeople than their were 5\nyears ago. Sir Keith Joseph\nhas challenged the\nprofession to provide\nexamples of the\n'widespread and\nir repairable damage' that is\nallegedly o cur ring, providing to fight for more\nmoney from the Treasury if\ntheir case is convincing.\nSir Ke'ith Joseph: Higher Education is vital.\nreserved for the privileged\nelite', But hasn't it always?\nThe proportion of working\nclass students gaining\nuniversity places FELL\nduring the post-Robbins\nexpansion era.\nThey have also\nreinterpreted Robbins: the\nfamous 1963 report stated:\n'That courses of Higher\nEducation should be\navailable for all those who\nare qualified by ability and\nattainment to pursue them\nand wish to do so'. It now\nstates courses of Higher\nEducation should be\navailable to all those who\ncan benefit from them and\nwish to do so. Now they\nwant more places available\nso that more students will\nbe available to them\nEXCEPT curiously in\nengineering, science and\ntechnology whose 'demand\nmust come first'. The\ngovernment accept this\nreform , but in order to\nmaintain high academic\nstandards it is insisting that\ninstitutions apply rigorous\nselection procedures.\nIt has occured to the\ngovernment that the\nnations demand for\ngraduates may not decline\nby 33% just because the\nbirth rate has.\nInconsequence the Green\nPaper proposes a reduction\nin student numbers by the\nmid 1990s of only 13%. The\nfigures show that after five\n'The government believes\nthat it is vital for Higher\nEducation to contribute\nmore effectively to the\nimprovement of the\nperformance of the\neconomy...'\nSir Keith Joseph\nContinued economic\nrecovery will be impeded if\ninstitutions of Higher\nEducation fail to provide\nmore graduates in skills in\nthe subjects\u2014such as\nscience, engineering and\ntechnology\u2014that industry\nneeds. Here it is to be\ncentral objective of the\ngovernments Higher\nEducation policy to secure\na major shift from the arts\nto science and technology.\nThe number of engineering\nstudents has already\nincreased from 27000 in\n1979 to 40000 n1984, and\nadditional res e ource s are\nbeing provided to create an\nadditional 400 places. The\npercentage of graduates\nqua life d in eng in gee ring and science will rise from\n33% in 1979-80 to 47% in\n1989-90. Only by forging\nlines between higher\neducation and graduate\nemployers can the role of\nhigher education and the\nneeds of the e como ny be\nbrought into line.\nSince rigorous arts\ncourses provide an\nexcellent preparation for\njobs which carry\nresp on sib lit y and are\npersonaly and intellectually\ndemanding, the number of\nplaces in arts subjects will\nonly fall slightly and will be\nconcentrated in\nuniversities.\nResearch\nThe total research budget\navailable to universities haj\nrisen in real terms since\n1979. Expenditure on\nscience has risen by 8% in\nreal terms over the same\nperiod and there will be no\nreduction in Governments\ncontribution over the\ncoming years. The mut al advantages to both industry\nand universities is closer\ncola b oration over research\nnot being exploited to their\nfull potential. Through\nsome collaboration\nuniversities gain additional\nfunds. Perhaps if we refuse\nto participate in defence\nresearch projects such as\nSDI, our department are\nnot worthy to remain open,\nas they attempt to take\npolitical decision on behalf\nof us all.\nFinance\nThe number of higher\neducation institutions has\nexpanded since Robbins to\naccommodate the extra\ndemand for places. No less\nthan 80% of the resources\nrequired for our universities\ncomes from the taxpayer.\nIndustry and commerce\nmust increase their\ncontributions substantially\nin line with our Western\ncompetitors to make the\nproportion equate to 75%\nfrom UGC. The government\nhas pledged that whatever\nthey get from private\nbenefactors, higher\neducation institutions can\nkeep\u2014it will not be\ndeducted from their\nrecurrent grants.\nThe government does not\nattempt to hide it's education policy. It's planning is immaculate,\nand it's projected future in\nline with economic growth\nand rejuvenation.\nConservatives do not wish\nto be blamed for dealing\nwith deep-rooted\nproblems\u2014they're proud of\nit.

    "content": "FLS At last, a comedy that's actually funny, well I thought so. Clockwise is a very suitable vehicle for\nJohn Cleese's talents. He\nplays the headmaster of a comprehensive school who\nhas the privilege of\nbecoming the Chairman of\nthe Headmaster's Conference at Norwich.\nThis is an illustrious post,\nparticularly as it has never\nbeen given to a comprehensive headmaster\nbefore, but it now gives the\naspiring Brian Stimpson a chance to address the\nheadmasters of Winchester,\nEton, Harrow, etc all the\nschools 'we all look down\nour noses at but would\nsend our children to if only\nwe had the money'.\nStimpson is a punctual\nman, to the point of timing\nhis morning assembly\nspeeches to the second\nand castigating his wife in\nfront of all the school\nchildren criminals, tempera l or otherwise, who have\nbeen sent to 'execution' at\n9.20 outside his office. A small distraction causes\nhim to miss his train to\nNorwich and from then on\nhis precise world begins to\ncrumble as he struggles to\nget to the conference.\nImportantly with comedy\nthe timing of all the\nexcellent cast is\nmarvellous, and the story\ncontained enough subplots to adequately fill out\nthe running time. An\nexample of the intelligence\nof Michael Frayn material is\nthe wonderful contrast\nbetween the sedate monks\nand the manic Mr\nStimpson.\nIt's almost unfair to\nsingle out particular\nperformances but John\nCleese, of course, and the\nold ladies were particularly\ngood. Recommended.\nIn complete contrast is\nRan, an astonishing epic\nfilm with few if any\nparallels, except possibly\nKurosawa's last film\nKagemusha which won the\nCannes Film Festival in\n1980 but which he\ndescribed as no more than\na run up to Ran.\ne The plot is largely based\non King Lear and concerns\nthe aging hard Hidetora\npassing power to his eldest\nson. Unfortunately he is\ndeaf to the pleas of his\nyoungest son who warns\nagainst the danger of this\naction. As a reward for his\nhonesty and loyalty the\nyoungest son, Saburo, is\nbanished along with the\nequal y loyal Tango,\nHidetorn then sets out with\nthe fool to madness.\nThis journey is set\nagainst a backdrop of civil\nwar which is beautiful\nchoreographed and\nstunningly photographed.\nThe battle scenes are some\nof the most haunting\nimages on film, true\ncinematic milestones.\n(During the film both\nKurosawa's wife and one of\nhis great friends, the sound\nrecorder, died, and\nsometimes it seems as if\nhis long and eventful life\nwith all it's passions has\ndiffused into the film.)\nThe acting of Hidetora in\nparticular has roots in the\nJapanese noh theatre and\nmay prove unconvincingly\nhistoric for an average\nwestern audience but the\nbrill ant ly scheming body\nKaede can be understood\nby any culture.\nThe ending departs from\nKing Lear and it removes\nthe optimism of\nShakespeare's play and\nreplaces it with a simple\nbut powerful allegory. It's length may possibly require\nsome effort, but that's a small price for a masterpiece.\nAt the risk of appearing\nin disc rim in ent in my praise\nI would also like to\nrecommend a third film out\nthis week, Jagged Edge.\nThis film owes a lot to the\nera of Hollywood\npsychological thrillers,\nthough this modern version\nshows a good deal more of\nthe blood and violence.\nJeff Bridges plays a manipulative, successful\nnewspaper editor accused\nof killing his heiress wife.\nInitially under duress, last\npartly to redeem her shelf for an earlier case,\ncorporate lawyer Teddy\nBarnes, Gleen Close,\ndecides to defend him.\nProsecuting him is the\nambitious District Attorney\nwho is 'as eager to ride this\ncase into a senate seat as\nhe is to prosecute the right\nman'.\nThe plot has enough\ntwists and turns to provide\na few surprises at the end,\nand the acting is\nmarvellous particularly Jeff\nBridges, who is normally\nassociated with easy going\ncharacters rather than\nmanipulative ones. Glenn\nClose too is excellent in\nher portrayal of all\nemotions of her character,\nto say which emotions\nwould give too much away.\nOf more dubious value,\nunfortunately, is 'Young\nSherlock Holmes and the\nPyramid of Fear', it is 'an\neffect ion speculation on\nwhat might have\nhappened'. It's heart is in\nthe right place, with some\nnice ideas on how the\ndear stalker and pipe etc\nmay have originated, but\nit's mind is a little\ndisplaced, about a century.\nBut perhaps I'm being a little unfair, both the young\nleads are very'engaging\nand Nicholas Rowe,\nSherlock, deserves to do\nwell, and they are\naccompanied by the\nexcellent Anthony Higgins\nand Freddie Jones and\neven Nachion Sawalha (as\nan Egyptian?!!). It's fairly\nenjoyable stuff and if you\ndo go and see it stay until\nthe very end, after the\ncredits).\nBriefly I'd like to mention\nsome interesting\nindependant films you\nmight like to see at the ICA\nif none of the above\ninterests you (or even if all\nthe above interests you).\nUrsula and Glenys is a tale\nof two sisters brought\ntogether by their father's unexpected legacy wish.\nIntimate Strangers tells the\nstory of a mother and son\nrelationship in Brixton. I found the latter more\ncredible and enjoyable and\nparticularly liked the very\nnatural grandparents.\nBenefits\ncontinued...\nServices Office and collect\nform HB8, this is all you\nneed to send in to be\nreassessed for the vacation.\nThis form should be sent to\nyou automatically but some\npeople always get\nforgotten.\nTo claim-if you haven't already submitted a claim:\nYou should submit claim\nforms the week before term\nends. Student Services has\nforms for most Boroughs, if\nwe haven't got the one you\nneed then we can tell you\nwhere to get hold of the\nright ones. When you\nsubmit your form you will\nneed to include proof of\nyour grant from your Local\nEducation Authority, proof\nof rent paid is a rent book\nor receipt/letter from your\nlandlord/letter from Student\nServices (your bill is not\nsufficient) and a note of\nyour term dates.\nRemember claims will not\nbe backdated so apply\nbefore the vacation, not\nafter.\nAny Problems\nVhe main disadvantage\nwith this kind of benefit is\nthe time it can take\nbetween making the claim\nand receiving any money. It'\ncan take up to 9 months! It\nis certainly worth keeping\nin touch with your Housing :\nBenefit Office, to remind\nthem of the existence of\nyour claim.

    "content": "Think we need an intro\nhere.\nDespite guest\nappearances from the likes\nof Peter Gabriel, Nile\nRodgers and Bill Laswelt,\nLaurie Anderson's Mister\nHeartbreak retains the fresh\nquirky American humour\nthat she has made her own.\nThe tracks on this album\nare collected from her five\nhour epic USA Parts 1-4\nand later projects. Most\nfamous for her (so far) only\n'chart success' Oh\nSuperman, Laurie\nAnderson is normally\nassociated with the New\nYork avant garde scene,\n\"Singing is a trick\nlisten to music for\nwhere she is famous for\nplaying violin with her feet\nfrozen in a block of ice!\nThis album, however is\nmore listenable, being a blend of ethnic sounds and\nrhythms, and modern ideas.\nAll this, with William\nBurroughs appearing on\nthe last track, can't be bad!\nLaurie Anderson is playing\nthe Hammersmith Odeon\nMay 24-26.\nBrian Eno, despite having\nmade 20 albums to date, is\none of these people who\neveryone has heard of, but\nno-one seems to have\nheard. More Blank Than\nFrank, just released, is a collection of Eno's songs\nfrom the period 1973-1977.\nThis compilation, according\nto the sleeve notes, marks\nthe release of More Dark\nThan Shark, a book based\non Eno's lyrics and Russell\nMills illustrative\ninterpretations. Whatever\nthe reason for its release,\nthis album chronicles the\nperiod after Eno left Roxy\nMusic and before becoming\nobsessed with ambience.\nThe tracks are taken from\nthe albums Here Come The\nWarm Jets, Taking Tiger\nMountain, Another Green\nWorld and Before And After\nScience, and are all typical\nof this Eno. Although best\nknown for his\ncollaborations with Talking\nHeads, Bowie, Devo and\nU2, the solo Eno is well\nworth a listen. Look out for\nthe Eno/Mills exhibition at\nthe Riverside.\nRobert Wyatt's Nothing\nCan Stop Us is an odd mix,\nranging from a cover\nversion of Chic's At Last I am Free, The Red Flag (a la\nLabour Party conference),\na Spanish folk song and\nto get people to\nlonger\"\nare scenes\nthe excellent Shipbuilding.\nWritten by Elvis Costello\nand Clive Langer,\nShipbuilding is one of the\nfew songs written about the\nFalklands War, and has\nsince become a classic\ndespite the small amount of\nairplay it has received.\nRobert Wyatt is most\nfamous for his work with\nthe Jazz-Rock group Soft\nMachine, although an\naccident with a liquid lunch\nand a third storey window\nended his career as a drummer. Since then the\nwheelchair bound musician\nhas been actively involved\nin South African, and other\nleft wing, protests. Nothing\nCan Stop Us is a must for\nevery radical student!\nBlack South Africa is rich\nmusically as is shown by\nthe next album, Rhythm of\nResistance, which is the\nsoundtrack of a film about\ncontemporary black music\nin South Africa. The film\ntraces the social roots of\nblack music, and shows it\nto be a voice of resistance\nto the apartheid system.\nBlack South Africans\nseldom lament or sing the\nblues, but show their\nsuperiority to an oppressive\nsystem by their joyfulness,\ntheir warmth and their\ndelight in living. The tracks\non this album are a selection from the\nprofessional recording side\nof black music, ranging\nfrom Jazz-rock through to\nthe more traditional, and is\nan excellent introduction to\na music, and a culture,\nwhich has so far been kept\nof the airwaves.\nPillows And Prayers,\nreleased in 1983, is a compilation featuring\nseventeen of the acts\nalbum, if you can still get\nhold of a copy, only costs\n99 pence. Cherry Red have\na reputation for signing\ngood new acts, so watch\nthis space for future Cherry\nRed releases.\nFinally despite over 30\nalbums to his name, Peter\nHammill remains largely\nunknown. His career\nstarted with Van Der Graff\nGenerator back in 1971,\nand stretches through to\nthe present day. Over is a fine example of one of his\nsolo albums written just\n\"Violence on television only affects\nchildren whose parents act like\ntelevision personalities.\"\nworking with Cherry Red,\nan independent label based\nin Kensington Gardens.\nQuoting from the sleeve\nnotes 'Within this project\nwe have tried to emphasise\nthe popularity and diversity\nof those on the label. In\naddition to the\ncontemporary material, a track by sixties\nPsychedelists, The\nMisunderstood is included\nas an introduction to our\narchive material'. Wowee!\nAlso included are tracks by\nTracey Thorn, Everything\nBut The Girl, Atilla The\nStockbroker and The\nMonochrome Set. The\n\"Dolphins find people amusing but\nthey don't want to talk to them.\"\nWednesday 19 March FELIX\nafter, and about, his long\ntime girlfriend leaving. It is\nallow ably self indulgent in\nits analysis of love, hate,\nlust and yoga. Musically\nboth emotional and\npowerful, it is very much in\nthe seventies mould.\nHowever Hammllls lyrics\nare his forte, which alone\nmake the album\nworthwhile. Listen out for\nthe bits which Marlllion\nripped off (Over is one of\nthe albums on the cover of\nMarillion's Fugazi). I recommend buying any of\nthe Hammill/Van Der Graff\nrecords.\n'Keep Music Live' runs the\nslogan of the musicians\nunion and so it should be\nin a place like London.\nMore to the point one of\nthe things I was always led\nto expect about university\nwas college bands. So what\nis the state of home grown\nmusic at IC? Prompted by\nmeeting people around\ncollege who seemed\ndisillusioned with\nconventional music (eg\nradio, TV, commercial\nrecords) I set out to get\nbetter informed.\nIt is fairly well known that\nBrian May of Queen is an\nex-science student at IC,\nbut to claim much\nconnection between Queen\nand IC is dubious to say\nthe least (although RCS may try, they also claimed\ntheir Hon Sec was a student!) Despite such a heritage the college band\n'scene' at IC seemed until\nrecently very much non-existant. For a college of\nover 5000 students IC has\nvery poor facilities for\nbands to rehearse and\nrecord. Basically the\nfacilities that are available\nrevolve around the\nmisleading ly named Jazz\nClub.\nCharles Brereton and the\nrest of the Jazz club\ncommit tte e were somewhat\nelusive but I got a better\nresponse from John\nLambert of the band\nSchrodinger's Cat, of whom\nmore later. The club has a room on the second floor\nof the union building rather\nignominiously above the\nladies loo. In addition to a very basic PA the room\nalso has a programmable\ndrum machine and there is\nsome store age space\nalthough it is fairly\ncramped. John pointed out\nthat the room is rather\npoor acoustically and really\nneeds proper carpeting and\nsome, wall drapes to\ndeaden reflections. In\naddition there are no multitrack recording fa cities at\nall.\nGiven this situation and\nthe oft quoted lack of arts\nstudents it is still wrong to\nwrite IC off musically. One\nband who seem to have\nattained cult status without\nany regard for the\nridiculousness of their\nsituation are the notorious\n'Norman and the\nNutburgers'. Having heard\nmuch about the guitar\ngigs. At that point their set\nconsisted of 3 songs which\nposed a minor problems\nwhen they had to do two\nencores. This led to a massive song writing spree\nin preparation for the\nPhysics/Life Sci party. The\nband are in fact based\naround people from\nPhysics 2 and are currently;\nJohn Lambert\u2014Vocals,\nGuitar and Harmonica;\nNick Coates\u2014Guitar;\nIsabel O 'Brien\u2014Violin,\nPiano and Vocals;\nSara Shepherd\u2014Bass and\nprowess of Andy 'Link\nWray' Meeson and the\nunique vocal qualities of\nCharlie Troupe. I finally\ncaught up with them at one\nof their many 'last ever\ngigs'. And jolly good fun\nthey were too, epi tom ising everything a garage band\nshould be. It appears that\nthey don't want to take\nthings too seriously, but\nwhether they have really\nplayed their LAST ever gig\nI'm still not sure.\nSchrodingers Cat are a band who seem a bit more\ncertain about what they are\ndoing. They describe\nthemselves as folk rock and\nwill be known to anyone\nwho went to the Smoking\nConcert or SCAB night\nwhich were their first two\nCredits:Writing Peter Wilson\nMark Cottle\nQuotes David Byrne\nBackground Images from \"More Dark than Shark\"\nEno/Mills (Pub. Faber and Faber)\nJim Clayden\u2014Drums,\nPercussion and Guitars.\nI first encountered\nSchrodingers Cat at their\nfirst outside gig on the 30th January this year which\nwas also their first with a drummer.This was at the\nPearly King Bromley-by Bow as support to\nAcoustic/Electric prog rock\nduo Twice Bitten.\nOriginally they got the slot\non a break even basis but\nas they packed the venue\nthey made a small amount\nof money and should, by\nthe time you read this, have\nplayed the same venue\nagain this Sunday.\nCurrently the band have\nbeen concentrating on\nincorporating Jim, the\ndu mmer into the line-up\nand are now working on\nbuilding their own PA.\nThey are helped in their\npound problems by the fact\nthat John worked as a sound engineer before he\ncame to IC. He explained\nto me how they hoped to\navoid the problems that\nsome bands experience in\n'Miking up' individual\npractice amps into hired PA\nsystems by building their\nown system. I also got\nsome of the shortcomings\nof the Jazz room system\npointed out to me as I watched them rehearse one\nFriday afternoon earlier this\nterm. They now have a set\nof about an hour of original\nmaterial in addition to\nwhich they do a good cover\nof a song called 'Only\nNinteen' by the Australian\nband Red Gum and also\n'Johnny B Goode'.\nFollowing the Physics Life\nSci party the original line\nup recorded a tape, using\nan old Revox 2-track\nm aching, which is available\nm rom John Lambert via\nPhysics 2 letter racks at\n\u00a32.50. This should help to\nfund further projects, the\nnext of which is to make a proper demo tape for\nrecord companies and the\nlike. To this end the band\nare hiring 16-track\nrecording equipment and\nborrowing IC radio's Southside studio for a week\nover Easter.\nHopefully this article will\nbe the beginning of a series\nhighlighting just what can\nbe done in the musical line\nat IC with a little\nper server ance. Last\nSaturday at the invitation of\nIan Morris the keyboard\nplayer I went to see Duo\nand next term I hope to do\nanother feature including\nthem. I will finish by noting\nthat at the begining of the\nyear the estimated budget\nfor Jazz Club was \u00a360 while\nat the last count they had\nover 70 members. Perhaps\nj writing about what people\nj are already doing will\ni encourage others to have a go and will at the same\ntime mean better facilities\ndevelop. Even if you're not\nvery musical, like me, Jazz\nclub is still looking for\nsome people with a bit of\norganisational gumption\nand en thus iam to run it\nFELIX Wednesday 19 March\n\n"

Not only\ncan she deal with specific\nhealth and welfare issues\nrelating to women BUT she\ncan also provide a point of\ncontact for those women\nwho dp feel isolated; and\nhopefully may be able to\nhelp. Nobody would\nsuggest that because the\nmajority of overseas\nstudents are quite content\nat Imperial, there shouldn't be a representative they\ncan turn to if they DO have\nspecific problems.

In the last\nfew weeks I 've got sick of\nhearing, \"But you're a feminist!...Not another\nfeminist!\" etc. Well of\ncourse I am a feminist \u2014\nand I would venture to\nsuggest that since fem in sim simply means, by\ndefinition, believing that\nnobody should be denied\nBad Attitude An opinion by Christine Taig\nOrve op\nof\ntV vaV i or \u00a3 \u00b0 r ra*:fe f*x \u00ab tes eM rf etti'1* \"The problem\ndoes not affect me\ndirectly, therefore\nthere is no\nproblem.\" What\nkind of attitude is\nthis?\nj Shortly after I volunteered to do the job of\n'Temporary Women's Officer' I sent out a letter to\nall female students, asking\nfor opinions on various\nsubjects. This seemed at\nthe time to be a sensible\nway of testing opinion on\nthe problems, IF ANY, that\nwomen at IC face. A small\nbut significant number of\nwomen wrote back, and\nmany more have spoken to\nme since, most of whom\nsaw the post of Women's Officer as a good thing.\nSome agreed with the ideas\nput forward, some didn't \u2014\nas you might expect.\nDisappointingly, NOBODY wrote back to ME to say,\n\"Shut up about the ratio,\nwe don't notice it...\" \u2014 this\nside of the discussion was\ncarried on in a most\nindignant fashion on the\npages of FELIX.\nTo those I offended by\nsending the letter, perhaps\nI owe an apology. I should\nhave pointed out, perhaps,\nthat I would welcome\nat college, who feel very\nisolated and lonely because\nof this. I realise that\nundergraduates in large,\nwell mixed departments\ndon't realise the plight of\nsuch women, who may be\nmainly postgraduates; but I think comments like, \"We\ndon't mind!... a few I suppose, must dislike [the\nsituation]\" are incredibly\nsweeping and selfish. I for\none, am not prepared to\nsee those women who ARE so unhappy written off in\nthis way \u2014 it doesn't matter\nif the majority of women\ncouldn't care less (although\nI doubt if this is true) \u2014 it\nstill doesn't mean that we\nshould ignore those who\ndo have problems. Surely\nthat would be narrow-minded and uncaring... the\nsame sort of attitude leads\nto statements like,\n\"Nightline should close\nbecause it only gets five\nsuicide calls a year\" \u2014\nignore the minority, the\nmajority are doing fine.\nThis is why the post of\nWould fl MV o^f\\ a) Ho\nrights or opportunities\npurely because she is\nfemale, every woman at\nImperial must be a feminist\ntoo, to some extent;\notherwise what would she\nbe doing studying a traditionally 'male' subject?\nCertainly none of us would\nbe here if it wasn't for the\nlife's work of those women\nAND men who held this\nbasic belief and struggled\nto secure educational\nopportunities for women in\nscience and technology.\nIt is a shame that so\nmany people abhor the\nterm 'feminist' because they\nthink it means a radical,\nhumour less, militant,\nman hating extremist who is\nprobably a lesbian and can,\nof course, be recognised by\nher appearance. This,\nneedless to say, is rubbish\n\u2014 it is the image of\nfeminists put about by the\ngutter-press' \u2014 and as\nImperial College students I would hope that we would\nlook further than THAT for\nour education.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 March 9\n\n"

    "content": "UG1VJketch\nIC Union General Meetings are idiosyncratic events,\noften without any relevance to anybody, let alone\nstudents. This column is a less than serious look at what\ngoes on in this much vaunted, but little attended regular\nevent.\nAfter the attendance at last\nThursday's UGM, it might be\na little more logical to hold\nthe next one in the\ntelephone box outside the\nRoyal College of Music,\nrather than that aircraft-hanger known as the Great\nHall. The only people there\nwere those who were\nactually standing for\nsomething, just won\nsomething, or just about to\npropose a motion. Not only\nwas there a distinct lack of\naudience, but a distinct lack\nof the Exec as well.\nThe Exec is made up of\nsix people, three sabbaticals\nand the three C CU presidents. Of those, two\nactually bothered to turn up,\nand one was de put is ed for\nby Dave Colley, who was\nonly there because he was\nabout to be ratified as ICU\nHonorary Secretary.\nIWe were told that Carl\nBurgess was lig g ing \"at a conference\" in Belgium.\nDave Kingston was away\ncanvassing for the ULU\nPresidency, seemingly\nunaware that he was not\nallowed to stand in the first\nplace. It seems no-one wants\nto register him as a student\nanymore, and ULU won't take him if he isn't. Dave Pearce, RSM\nPresident, carried on his\ntradition of never turning up\nto UGMs anyway. And\nRoger Preece? Well, it was\nmainly his fault that nobody\nturned up here, as they were\nall in Mech Eng 220 at the\ntime. In his somewhat less\nthan infinite wisdom, he\ndecreed that the City and\nGuilds Union elections\nshould take place at\nprecisely the same time.\nRunning in fear that\nsomeone should call\n\"quorum!\", Chris Hendy,\nchairing the meeting, took\nthe passing of the last set of\nminutes using his inimitable\n\"section-2.1-bit-about-bars-is-that-alright-shall-l take-it-in-parts-no-you-can't ask-a question\" routine.\nFrom there the meeting\nwent into several bye-law\nchanges all because Alan\nRose decided that he wanted\nto be called Internal Services\nOfficer rather than Chairman\nin a fit of pedantry. No-one\ncould really argue with him\nat the time, since he had\ncontrol of the PA at the time.\nAt this point Christine\nTaig, stood up and took the\nmicrophone ready for a speech on her motion as to\nwho is allowed to vote in the\nWomens' Officer elections.\nDespite the original motion\nbeing defeated at the\nHustings UGM, which stated\nthat only women would be\nallowed to vote, it turned out\nthat no-one wanted to\noppose this after all.\nThe fun continued with\nthose all important U GM Chairman and Academic\nAffairs Officer elections.\nProspective Chairman\nGareth Fish fell at the first\nhurdle by picking the booby-trapped microphone, which\ngave him the verbal lucidity\nof the public address system\nat Waterloo Station.

    "content": "Boat\nSaturday last saw a strong\nperformance by Imperial\ncrews at Reading Head.\nThis is the last head for\nmost crews before the main\nevent of the season-the\n'Eights Head of the River',\nand Reading Head is seen\nas an indication of how\ncrews will perform in 'The\nHead'.\nIC first crew is showing\ngood racing form and they\nwon the Senior A Pennant\nin a convincing manner.\nThey came fifth overall,\nbeating Oxford's first\ncrews. It is an indication of\nthe calibre of this crew and\nthat they were dissatisfied\nthat this margin was not\nsmaller.\nThe head was won\noverall by the University of\nLondon eight.\nIC's second eight were\nunlucky to loose the Senior\nB pennant by five seconds.\nThe club has had a recent\nspate of illness and the\nlatest victim James\n'Thunderthighs' Ganderton\nwent down with 'Spag Bol\nPoisoning', and was unable\nto row. He was replaced by\nRichard 'I 've done lots of\ntraining-honest' Evans, but\nthe crew was unable to find\ntheir previous cohesion and\nwere disappointed to finish\neighteenth overall.\nThe novice crew gave a sterling performance,\nfinishing a close third in\ntheir division. They too had\na substitute in their crew,\nwho considering his lack of\nexperience rowed very well.\nThey were in contact with\nthe division winners until\nnear the end and might\nhave won the novice\npennant, had they not been\nhalted by catching two\ncrabs.\nProspect for The Head'\nare excellent. The crews\nare expected to reach a peak for the head and will\nbe on their home water. IC\nfirst crew is hoping for a top ten position. If the\nsecond eight can find form\nthey will also have a good\nresult. The novices have\ncome on encouragingly,\nconsidering that only two\nof the crew has previous\nrowing experience. Two\nfurther crews will represent\nImperial. The 'Old Boys',\ncontaining the elite winner\nof Burway Fours, with\n'squid' Mason ex-olympic\noarsman; and the\n'Epsilons', a bunch of\nindescribable gorillas,\nwhose only hope is a freak\ntidal wave.\nMr Mason receives his\nOAP bus-pass in July.\nNot the Boat Club in action.\nFootball\nGuys 1 IC 31\nAfter losing Jim Wilson on\nthe train and rather\nunluckily recovering him\nbefore kick off, IC knocked\nhigh flying Guys out of\ntheir stride. Wright outdid\nBrunds 1 min 50 sec knock\nout but the referee warned\nhim for illegal use of the\nhead. 'Motormouth'\nBuckley then conceded a clear penalty, which keeper\nMartin's right hand post\nknocked away brilliantly.\nHowever the very same\npost then body-swerved\namazingly in order to\ndeceive the keeper and\ngather the ball from an\ninnocuous high chip to put\nGuys ahead. Despite some\nentertaining refereeing IC\nturned round only 1-0\ndown.\nThe second half saw the\nreferee continue to thrill\nthe crowd with some\nunorthodox stuff, including\na marvellous five minute\nrecital to skipper Martin\nLake about omnipotence\nand his lack of it. This ref\nwas blind but very\nobviously not deaf. IC\npressed forward and were\nrewarded with an equalizer\nfollowing Jim 'Warder'\nWilson robbing the keeper\nand scoring via a defender's outstanding\nshot. The game was\nanybody's at this stage and\nseveral times IC had men\nover with the final ball\nlacking. However, Guys\ncame back and a brilliant\nlast minute, one-headed,\nspine-tingling hair-raising\ndeath defying, dramatic\nand rather quite good save\nby Dave Martin secured IC\na valuable point.\nIC 3rds1 RSM 0\nRSM came into this game\ntop of the table requiring\njust 2 points in their\nremaining 3 games to\nensure promotion. At the\nother extreme IC were\nbottom and needed to win\n2 games from the last 4 to\navoid relegation. All the\nsmart money was on Mines\n(There was even talk that\nthey would score more\nthan England had against\nthe W Indies) but then\nfootball is a funny game!\nThe first half was fairly\neven with Lawrence Covi!\ndominating the IC defence\nand restricting the\ndangerous Mines forward\nto one shot on goal. The\nmost dangerous forward\nwas taken care of by a well\naimed knee, straight to his\nballs, by capt ian Martin\nLake.\nThe onslaught on the IC\ngoal continued in the\nsecond half but the back\nfour of Hugo Alexander,\nRob Kelly, Laurence and\nJim Wilson held firm with\nthe occasional mistake\nsnapped up by keeper Dave\nMartin. With twenty\nminutes left and the game\nstill a stalemate, another\nbrilliant tactical decisions\nsaw Lake subst it ue himself\nfor Eddy Hanett.\nSoon after this a break\nfrom IC saw Kev Buckley\nrun clear and slot the ball\nthrough the Mines defence\nto the feet of Mike 'go for\ngoal' Housby who slotted\nthe ball beyond the\nadvancing keeper and into\nthe net via a defender's boot.\nIt was then just up to the\ndefence to keep up the\ngreat work done so far.\nThey slipped up once but\nthe forward who was\nthrough on his own shot\nwide.\nSo much for RSM's earlier quote from FELIX\n(the best team in College)!\nIC 6th s14 CXWM 1\nAfter a long lay off IC VI\nreturned to action last\nWednesday. Winning 4\nuseful league points helped\nsoften the blow of Derby\nCounty's shock FA Cup\ndefeat later that evening.\nGoals from Matt Smith (5),\nAl Bamford (3), Si Moulton\n(2), Dave Simner (1), and\nEddy Hodnett (3) ensured a more respectable league\nposition for the season.\nGoal keeper Bran Radukil\nwas unlucky not to keep a clean sheet when the only ,\ndefence mix up of the\ngame allowed the\nopposition a consolation\ngoal.\nTen Pin\nBowling\nStirchley bowl, Birmingham\nwas the venue for this\nyear's sixes tournament,\narguably the most\nimportant event of the\nannual fixture list. We\narrived in good spirits to\nfind out that two of the\nteam had got lost,\nsomewhere south of\nWatford. However our\ndecision to stay and\ncompete was soon\nvindicated by excellent\nperformances from Paul\nSteward (242), Nick\nBrigham (191), Roger Allen\n(195) and Richard Ingram\n(190). However this being a sixes tournament, our four\nman team began to slip\nnarrowly behind the\nBirmingham team (the\neventual winner) as the day\nprogressed. We were left to\nreflect on what might have\nbeen: had Mssrs Gamian\nWong and Sean Bailey\nattended geography classes\nat school they would surely\nhave known in what region\nBirmingham is situated.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 March 21\n\n"

    "content": "Dainty\nProtest\nPhysics lecturer Professor\nJC Dainty walked out of a first year lecture last\nWednesday after a paper\nmissile was thrown by a student.\nProf Dainty was due to\ngive a lecture in Quantum\nMechanics. The class was\nparticularly noisy from the\noutset and he at once\nrequested the students to\nquiet en down. After five\nminutes a paper dart was\nthrown as Prof Dainty was\nwriting on the blackboard.\nAs he turned round a heavier paper missile was\nthrown from the back of\nthe lecture theatre. He\nasked whoever was\nresponsible to leave\nimmediately, and repeated\nthe request when nobody\ncame forward, threatening\nin addition to stop the\nlecture. When none of the\nstudents left, Prof Dainty\nwalked out, saying that the\nlecture would not be\nrepeated and that the\nrelevant material was still\nexam in able. Prof Dainty was later\nvisite*d by the Academic\nReps, who apologised on\nbehalf of the class. He\nreturned to hold a class work at 11.30 and\nagreed that he would re-teach the material in the\nnext lecture period. He\napologised for walking out\nand said that he\nappreciated the Academic\nReps coming to see him.\nProf Dainty told FELIX\nearlier this week that the\nincident was very\nunfortunate, but that he felt\nhe had to make a statement. He regretted\nthat the student responsible\nhad still not come forward,\nbut stressed that 'the door\nis still open for he or she to\napologise'.\nChaplaincy\nCollect\n\u00a3112 was raised for Oxfam\nby members of the West\nLondon Chaplaincy and the\nWest London Catholic\nChaplaincy on Saturday. 30\npeople took part in the one\nhour 'sponsored bus k' in\nCovent Garden. The event\nincluded singing, clowning,\njuggling and performances\nfrom a Baroque group.\nKingston Cannoned\nICU Deputy President Dave\nKingston has failed in his\nbid to win the post of UL U President for next year.\nSaturday's election was\nwon by Jane Cannon of\nUCL, who polled 40 votes\nout of 92 on the first\nallocation, lain Walsh was\nsecond with 27 and Dave\nKingston third with 24.\nAdam Wyatt polled only\none vote and came fourth.\nMr Kingston was eliminated\nafter the first re-allocation.\nThe final voting figures\nwere, Jane Cannon 56, lain\nWalsh 34.\nIt had seemed doubtful\nlast week that Mr Kingston\nwould be able to stand in\nthe election. As a sabbatical at IC he is not\nregistered on any course\nand so is not a registered\nstudent of London\nUniversity. This made him\nineligible as aUL U candidate. Mr Kingston was\nallowed to register on a course in the Aeronautics\nDepartment last Friday\nafter a meeting with IC\nRector Professor Eric Ash.\nMr Kingston told FELIX\nthat he was disappointed\nwith the result, but that he\nwas not taking it\nparticularly badly. He\nadded that he thought Jane\nCannon would do an 'okay\njob' as President.\nWinos Win\nImperial College have\nreached the final of the\nPeter Dominic InterUniversity Wine Tasting\nCompetition by winning the\nSouth East England round\nof the competition.\nThe team, which\nconsisted of Mark Masento,\nTony Broadbent, John\nCraven, Keith Russel and\nJulian Wilson, had to\nidentify the country of\norigin, the subregion, grape\nvariety, year of vintage and\nproducer's name of several\nwines.

Assistant\nSecretary Michael Arthur\nand ICU Deputy President\nDave Kingston discussed\ndetails of the new\nprocedure before it was\nsubmitted. Mr Kingston\nsaid that the changes\nsuggested by the Union\nhad been included, and\nthat he was satisfied with\nthe final form of the new\npolicy. In particular, the\nclause which had allowed a student's penalty to be\nincreased if he or she\nappealed against a decision\nhad been omitted.\nCrunch\nFELIX editor Hugh Southey\nfractured the base of his\nthumb whilst playing for IC\nhockey 3rds at Wimbledon\non Saturday.\nAlternative z Prospectus %\nUnlikely\nThere will not be an\nAlternative Prospectus\nproduced this year because\nof IC Union's unwillingness\nto go against a decision\ntaken by last year's Union\nFinance Committee.

'What does\nthat mean?'\n'It's because the air is in\nbetween the egg, the\nfeather and the ground. It's all around in fact. When\nthey fall to the ground, they\nhave to push the air out of\nthe way. The egg can do\nthat more easily because of\nits streamlined shape'.\nMr Van Zoom thought for\na while.\nThis sounded like a bit of\na hoax, to him. Much too\ncomplicated. Mr Van Zoom\ndecided he would definitely\nneed some evidence. 'Can\nyou show me why it should\nbe, that the egg falls faster,\njust because of \"air\nresistance\"?' he asked.\n'Yes, I believe I can,'\nreplied the scientist. 'Can I borrow your hoover for a minute?'\n'Certainly' replied Mr Van\nZoom 'Especially if this will\nexplain to me why the egg\nfalls faster than the feather'.\n'Oh, it will, it will,' replied\nthe scientist. He fished out\na big glass tube with a wooden platform inside it.\nHe balanced an egg and a feather on the pla f torm. 'Just like on top of my\ncupboard back at home'\nthought Mr Van Zoom,\n'only inside that big glass\ntank'.\nThen the scientist put\nhoover over the top of the\nglass tube, and switched\nhim on. Hoover sucked\nharder and harder until he\ncouldn't suck any more.\n'What on Earth is he\ndoing?' wondered Mr Van\nZoom.\n'Now' said the scientist. '\nWe have sucked all the air\nout of the tube. If there is\nno air, there will be no air\nresistance, so the egg and\nthe feather should now fall\nat the some rate'. And with\na flourish, he flipped the\npla form so that the egg and\nthe feather fell. Mr Van\nZooms eyes got wider and\nwider as he watched the\nfeather fall quickly down\nthe tube-at exactly the\nsame speed! 'And if we now\nlet the air back in' he\ncontinued, removing\nhoover from the top of the\nglass tube, 'The egg and\nthe feather will fall at\ndifferent rats just as\nbefore'.\n'Wow!' said hoover 'That's so crazy its got to be true!'\n'Besides', said Mr Van\nZoom,' we saw it with our\nown eyes.'\n'Ralph!' said Ralph.\n'I think,' said Mr Van\nZoom, I think I would like\nto be a scientist\u2014just for a short time, just to know\nwhat it is like'.\nThe scientist replied 'I think that if you look you\nwill find that you already\nare a scientist'.\n'Hmm...' said Mr Van\nZoom, doubtfully. 'I 'll think\nabout that'.\n'Ralph!' said Ralph.\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom. 'Let's go\nback home and finish the\nhoover ing. Peter Klemperer\nSailing Athletics\nIC 7 Oxford 1\nAfter a lapse of sailing for\nseveral weeks due to frozen\nreservoirs, Captain Mc\nLowe turned towards the\nteam, each member\nanxiously waiting to hear\nwhether they would be\nsailing.\n'It's on', he muttered. We\nall knew what this meant. It\nmeant that Oxford had\naccepted our challenge. It\nmeant that Farmoor\nreservoir was defrosting.\nAnd it meant we could have\nto miss a day at the bar in\nthe Dinghy Exhibition.\nSo on Saturday the team\ntravelled to Oxford to do\nwhat was necessary.\nFive races were sailed\nbefore lunch, which\nresulted in 4 clear wins,\ndespite Ape's nerve-racking\nattempts to start late...\nThe 3 afternoon races\nwere much closer fought,\nwith much place changing\noccur ing, though IC's superior team racing tactics\nensured that the team\nalways ended in a winning\ncombination\nThe undeniable hero of\nthe day was Daniel, who\ndespite his limited\nexperience as a helm,\nsaved the last race by\nslowing Oxford enough for\nthe rest of the team to sail\nto a123 victory\nA very enjoyable day was\nhad by all, finishing with a hearty meal of b angers n' mash at Tony and Celia's flat.\nRifle\nRifle Inter C CU full bore rifle\ncompetition\nRCS 328, RSM 314, C&G292 RCS won the annual full\nbore rifle match held at\nBisley last Sunday. This\nwas despite the absence of\ntwo key team members.\nCompetition from the\nRSM and C&G teams was\nfierce and the result was\nclose. The highest scorer\nwas an Irishman who shot\nfor the RSM team. (This\nwas unsurprising since he\nis also a member of the\nIrish National Squad). The\nfact that he wore a Manchester University\nsweatshirt made his\ninclusion in the RSM Team\nrather dubious.\nThe RCS victory means\nthat it is the overall winner of\nthe Inter C CU rifle and pistol\ncompetition both on points\nand number of matches won.\nOn the first Wednesday of\nthe Summer Term, 23rd April, IC Sports Day is to\nbe held at Motspur Park in j Surrey. Here is a summary\nof the essential details.\nEveryone represents their]\nC CU, the number of\nentrants per event is\nunlimited.Transport will be\nprovided to and from\nMotspur Park. We hope to\nprovide refreshments and\nthere is a bar on site. The\nfixture starts at 2.00pm and\nshould finish by 6.00pm. The programme will\ninclude all athletics track\nevents from 100m up to'\n3000m and all field events-medals will be presented\nfor all events and there are\ntrophies for some events.\nFurther, there will be some\n'fun' events including 'The\nPeeled Banana Medley\nRelay' 'Piggy Back Relays'\nand 'The Backward Three\nLegged Egg and Spoon\nRace.'\nAnybody who is\ninterested should get in\ntouch with their CCU's 'Sport Day Representative'\nor John Pope, Athletics\nSecretary for the Crosscountry Club as soon as\npossible\nWe hope to produce a Sports Day programme and\nit would be helpful if\npeople entered before the\nend of the spring term so\nthat we can put their names\nin the programme.

Robert\nPatrick's play, written in\n1974, received wide acclaim\nfor its departure from\ntraditional theatre, and can\nbe seen as having set a precedent in terms of its\ncharacter is ation and style.\n'The Deer Hunter'\n(Michar Cimino) was made\nin 1978.\nYours sincere jy Simon Lewis\n(Director, Kennedy's Children)\nGrow Up Seymour!\nDear Mr Southey,\nIt seems to me that anyone\nwho is childish enough to\ngripe publicly about being\n, refused entry to a nightclub\nis liable for some-good\nnatured mickey taking. Mr\nSeymour seems to be\nranting and raving about\ntwo letters (not exactly a vast amount of newsprint!)\nbeing slightly critical of\nhim. He also appears to\ndislike Star Trek\u2014which is,\naccording to my survey,\nquite popular amongst IC\nI students. The same survey\nj also happened to find the\n\\ aforementioned letters\nquite amusing, which\nsomewhat contradicts Mr\nSeymour's claim to\n:\nrepresent the vast majority\nof students.\nQuite honestly, anyone\nI intelligent enough to be\nhere (and I assume Mr\nSeymour is amongst them)\nshould be mature enough\nto take such things in his\nstride\u2014and not behave like\n| a 'moaning minnie'.

I became a Christian at IC\nthrough studying the Bible\nand the claims of Jesus\nChrist. Over the four years\nI have been a Christian I have become convinced of\nthe authority and re li abl it y of the Bible as the word of\nGod. During my\nconversations with the\nmembers of CARP it has\nbecome clear that they are\nnot Christian. When\nconfronted with this, and\nafter having their questions\nanswered from the Bible\nthey were speechless, and\nended our conversation,\n(usually after an hour or\nso). The point of this letter\nbeing a warning to those at\nIC who are genuinely\ninterested in looking at\nwhat Jesus said. Avoid the\nMoonies. Ask your friends\nwho you know to be\nChristians or a member of\nthe Christian Union. These\npeople will probably have\nbecome Christians a similar\nway as myself, that is, by\nindependent study and\nconviction by the Holy\nSpirit leading to the same\nconclusion: Jesus is Lord.\nYours faithfully,\nBG Clarkson\nChem Eng PG\nAn Apology\nDear John,\nI should like to apologise\nfor the advertisement in\ntoday's FELIX (March 12)\nconcerning the Jazz Club\nAnnual General Meeting.\nThe comment about Duo\nwas not meant to be taken\nseriously\u2014I am quite sure\nthat, if elected next\nTuesday (March 18), you\nwould do a very good job\nof running Jazz Club next\nyear. I hope that this\nincident will not cause ill-feeling between us\u2014or\nmore importantly the bands\nwe are involved in. Please\naccept my sincere\napologies.\nI should also like to point\nout that the comment about\nmy fiddling the books was\nnot meant to cause any\nalarm.

In\nmy two terms at Imperial I have met several people\nwho share my interest in\ntrain spotting. I am sure\nthat there must be a sufficient number of\nenthusiasts to form a trains potters' club.\nSuch a club would be\nable to organize weekend\ntrips and talks. It would\nalso provide a forum for\nfellow trains potters to swap\nexperiences arid compare\nnumbers.\nIf anyone is interested in\nsuch a club I would be glad\nto hear from you then.\nYours\nJ Harnett\nChem Eng 1\nMelliar-Smith\nExists!\nDear Ed,\nI read with interest Ms\nDiane Love's letter in FELIX\nFri 7th March in which she\nsets out her theory on the\nnon-existence of a certain\nTom Melliar-Smith (TMS\nfor short) and possibly\nreasons for his creation by\nthe...'Haven of ageing,\nwrinkled and degenerate\nhacks'.\nLeaving aside the\nquestions of what the RCS represents to its members,\nand what is in store for us\nnext year, I would like to\npoint out some errors in\nher imaginative and\ninteresting theory, and then\nshow logically that TMS exists after all.\nThe theory starts by\nassuming TMS does exist,\nand thus has two arms and\ntwo forearms, making ten\nin all. However, as any\nbiologist will explain, a forearm is only half an arm.\nIn other words, TMS only\nhas three arms. This is a significant point, as she has\neffectively shown that\n3=10. This simple equation\nis a new equation,\nunknown to every\nmathematician since we\nfirst climbed down from the\ntrees. It is so new in fact,\nthat many people will\nrefuse to accept it and\nclaim that it is false. If so,\nthen the theory suddenly\nstarts to look dubious.\nThe next error occurs\nwhen she explains that as\nten is both even and odd,\nthen 10=infinity and so\nTMS has an infinite number\nof arms (derived,\nincidentally from yet\nanother new equation).\nThe last, and biggest\nerror is to assume from this\nthat TMS cannot exist.\nHowever infinitely small\nobjects may be ignored,\nbut the problems of\nignoring infinitely large\nobjects are infinitely worse.\nObviously, with so many\narms, he cannot not exist.\nHad she realised this she\ncould then have made\nfurther deductions\nconsistent with other facts\nabout the college.\nAs a physicist, albeit an\nex-physicist, she must be\nfamilar with Einstein's famous equation E=MC2. As he has an infinite\nnumber of arms hence\ninfinite mass, he must\npossess infinite energy.\nWhich neatly explains its\ntotal lack elsewhere the in\nCollege. Indeed, the only\nother place energy occurs\nis in pubs and bars during\nopening hours. This is\neasily explained by\nassuming that as he has an\ninfinite number to spare,\nTMS gives his energetic\narms to otherwise 'arm less' students, where the energy\nbecomes the potential\nenergy created in raising\nthe drinks from table to\nmouth.\nFinally to dispel any\nlingering doubt, below is\nanother, more logical proof\nof his existence.\n1 Both sentences 1 and 2\nare false\n2 Tom Melliar-Smith exists.\n1 Cannot be true, as it\nthen asserts its own\nfalsehood so 1 is false. 2 is\neither true or false. If it is\nfalse, this means both 1\nand 2 are false, so 1 is true.\nHowever 1 cannot be true,\nas already shown, so 2\ncannot be false. So 2 is\ntrue. So TMS really does\nexist after all, as any NMR\nspec tros cop is t could have\nexplained in the first place!\nMark Oram\nChemistry 1.\n4 Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

In the final they beat\nSt Thomas's Hospital 12-9.\nIC scored first when Paul\nSeccombe gathered the broken\nball and j inked through the St\nThomas's forwards. This\nenabled Owen Miles to wriggle\nfree and score in the corner.\nNeil Folland converted the try.\nIC took a twelve-nil lead when\njust before half-time Hutchinson\nbroke blind and fed Seccombe\nwho beat one man and kicked\nahead over the remaining\ndefence. It was a sixty yard\nchase which Seccombe won to\ntouch down inches inside the\ndead ball line. Folland again\nconverted.\nAfter half-time IC should have\nsewn up the game had they\nbeen able to turn pressure into\npoints. Unfortunately St\nThomas's managed to rally and\nIC Rugby 1st XV\nscored a late try in the corner\nand a penalty to bring the score\ntwelve points to nine.

Residents of Beit Hall\nOld hostel were evacuated\nwhen fire officers ordered the\nwhole of the west side of Beit\nQuad to be cleared. College fire\nofficer Bob Foggon has\nestimated the cost of damage at\naround \u00a34,000.\nThe fire was discovered at\n10.30pm by Dr Selkirk who was\nworking late in the department.\nFiremen were on the scene\nwithin ten minutes of the alarm\nbeing raised, and the blaze was\nrapidly brought under control.\nBeit Hall residents left their\nrooms when the alarm bells\nwere first sounded, but reentered the building when the\nalarm ceased to ring. On\ndiscovering this, the senior fire\nofficer informed ICU Deputy\nPresident Dave Kingston that\nthere was still a 'bio hazard' and\nthe Old Hostel had to be\ncleared again.\nThe fire was located in a lean-to on the west side of the\ndepartment's paris it ology unit.\nMr Foggon told FELIX that the\nsuspected cause of the fire was\nan electrical fault in a freezer.\nBags of sawdust which were\nstacked around the freezer were\nset alight as was the casing of\nthe freezer. The fire spread to\nsome plastic car bouy s and to\nthe shed itself. The\ndepartment's incinerator was\nalso severely damaged. Senior\nDepartmental Superintendent\nRoy Adams said that it was\nessential to have the incinerator\nin working order.

Mr Fontana had not\nreceived reports from any Union\nOfficer, and had not had time to\nget any minutes written up from\nother Union Committees. Mr\nFontana said that very few\nofficers' reports had been\nsubmitted on time all year, and\nthat he had 'bugger all to say'.\nMr Kingston and Mr Fontana\ncontacted Council Chairman\nHugh Stiles who agreed that\nCouncil should be cancelled.\nOn Monday Internal Services\nChairman Alan Rose collected\nseveral signatures from Council\nmembers who objected to the\ncancellation.

He sat down\nand wiped his brow. 'Phewi\nhe thought That was\nclose'. Meanwhile, the\nfeather drifted gently to the\nground. Mr Van Zoom\nlooked at it curiously. 'I wonder,' he said, 'I wonder\nwhy it is that the egg falls\nso much quicker than the\nfeather?'\n'Yes, I wonder' replied\nthe hoover. Mr Van Zoom\nsaid 'Who could we ask to\nexplain why the egg falls\nfaster than the feather?'\nJust then, Mr Van Zoom's dog, Ralph, leapt in.\n'RALPH!' he said.\nm 'What a good idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom. 'We'll go and\nask the Busy Man. He\nalways seems to know what\nhe's talking about'.\nSo Mr Van Zoom, hoover\nand Ralph, went to visit the\nBusy Man. He was in his\noffice writing important\nletters. Mr Van Zoom asked\nhim 'Why does the egg fall\nfaster than the feather?'\n'Don't bother me now!'\nsaid the Busy Man, 'I 've got\nthree thousand telephone\ncalls to make before lunchtime\n'Wow! said hoover.' That\nperson doesn't have very\nmuch time to spare!'\n'Well, that's fair enough I suppose', thought Mr Van\nZoom.\n'But you still don't know\nwhy the egg falls faster\nthan the feather, do you?'\nSaid the hoover.\n'Well, who can I ask\nnext?' asked Mr Van Zoom.\n'Ralph!' Said Ralph.\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom, and his eyes\nlit up eagerly. 'We'll go and\nask the Old Woman. She\nhas so much experience,\nshe must be able to help'.\nSo Mr Van Zoom, hoover\nand Ralph went to visit the\nOld Woman. She was in her\ncottage, s pining wool Mr\nVan Zoom asked her 'Why\ndoes the egg fall faster\nthan the feather?'\n'Well, now..let me see...'\npondered the Old Woman'\nIt's something to do with\nthe Chicken and the\nEgg...or something.'\n'I don't understand that!'\nsaid Mr Van Zoom. 'What\ndid you mean?'\n'I'm not sure that I know\nmyself!' replied the old\nWoman.\n'Wow!' said hoover. That\nperson believes some\nthings that don't make\nsense!\n'Well, that's fair enough I suppose,' thought Mr Van\nZoom.\np. \u00bb ' organises \u00ab ..-r rKo 'But you still don't know\nwhy the egg falls faster\nthan the feather, do you?'\nSaid the hoover.\n'Well, who can I ask next?'\nasked Mr Van Zoom.\n'Ralph!' said Ralph.\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom, and his\nfingers twitched with\nexcitement. 'We'll go and\nask the priest. He always\nhas an answer to\neverything!\nSo Mr Van Zoom, hoover\nand Ralph went to visit the\npriest. He was in his\nchapel, meditating quietly.\nMr Van Zoom asked him\n'Why does the egg fall\nfaster than the feather?'\nThe Egg & the\nleather\nA brief and simple story\n'Well, that's because God\nmade the World that way'\nsaid the priest.\n'I'm sorry?' asked Mr Van\nZoom.\n'You'll know when the\ntime has come', replied the\npriest, calmly.\n'I see..' said Mr Van\nZoom, not really seeing at\nall.\n'Wow!' said the hoover.\n'That person seems to\nbelieve some things without\never asking 'why?'! 'Well,\nthat's fair enough I suppose', thought Mr Van\nZoom.\n'But you still don't know\nwhy the egg falls faster\nthan the feather, do you?'\nSaid the hoover.\n'Well, who can I ask\nnext?' asked Mr Van Zoom.\n'Ralph!' said Ralph.\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom, and his ears\ntingled with anticipation.\nWe'll go and ask the\nteacher. She's so used to\nexplaining things she must\nbe able to help.'\nSo Mr Van Zoom, hoover\nand Ralph went to visit the\nteacher. She was in her\nclassroom, giv nga lesson.\n'Excuse me', said Mr Van\nZoom, 'But why does the\negg fall faster than the\nfeather?'\n'Hmm! said the teacher.\nThat's a tricky one! Let me\nthink for a moment'.\n'Ralph!' said Ralph.\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom, and his\nknees quivered with\ndelight. 'While the teacher\nis thinking, 'let's ask the\nchildren! they are so\nimaginative, they must be\nable to help'.\nSo while the teacher was\nthinking Mr Van Zoom\nasked the children 'Why\ndoes the egg fall faster\nthan the feather?'\n'It's because the egg is\nheavier!' said a girl. Mr Van\nZoom thought for a while,\nThis sounded a like a really\ngood explanation, but\nbefore he was willing to\nbelieve it, Mr Van Zoom\ndecided that he needed\nsome evidence. 'Can you\nexplain why it should be,\nthe egg should fall faster\njust because it is heavier?'\nHe asked.\n'Because...well, because\nheavy things always fall\nfaster!' replied the girl,\nlooking a little doubtful.\n'Hmmm...' said Mr Van\nZoom, still not quite\nconvinced.\n'Wow!' said hoover. That\nperson seems to have some\nreally good ideas to explain\nthings but can't prove them\none way or the other!'\nMeanwhile the teacher\nhad finished thinking. 'I couldn't be sure of the\nanswer myself she said to\nMr Van Zoom, 'but I can\ntell you who would know!\nYou'll have to ask the\nscientist!'\n'That's a great idea!' said\nMr Van Zoom, and his nose\nitched with enthusiasm.\n'We'll go and ask the\nscientist. All those\nexperiments of his must\nhave some use or other!'\nSo Mr Van Zoom, hoover\nand Ralph went to visit the\nscientist. He was in his\nlaboratory, writing\nequations. 'Why does the\negg fall faster than the\nfeather?' asked Mr Van\nZoom.\n14 Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "m Benefits\nThe FELIX guide to what you should be claiming this holiday.\nClaiming Benefits over the\nEaster Vacation\nIt is now time to think\nabout claiming money over\nthe Easter vacation. This\narticle is designed to give\nyou an idea of what you\ncan claim and how to do it!\nIf you find yourself\nconfused or in difficulties\nthen call into Student\nServices and see Lesley,\nthe Welfare Adviser.\nUndergraduate Students\nThe Undergraduate student\ngrant contains an element\nof \u00a327.50 pw to cover your\nliving expenses during the\nEaster vacation. Unlike\nterm-time, there is no\nelement included in the\ngrant for rent over these\nperiods. If you have to pay\nrent during the vacations,\nyou are entitled to claim\nthe money back.\nPostgraduate Students\nPostgraduate grants\ncontain living and rent\nelements for 52 weeks of\nthe year and therefore\npostgraduate students have\nno extra eligibility for\nbenefits over the vacation.\nWhich Method Should You\nUse\na) Staying in London: there\nare two methods of\nclaiming rent money back,\nthe one to use depends\npartly on whether you\nintend to remain at your\nterm-time address over the\nChristmas period. The\nfastest and most efficient\nway to get the maximum\namount, if you are eligible,\nis to 'sign on' as\nunemployed with the\nDepartment of Social\nSecurity, the DHSS. For\npayments from the DHSS,\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit, you need to be in\nLondon throughout the\nvacation period, be\nclassified as a householder\nand be available for work in\nthe area you live in.\nb) Going home: However, for\nthose who do not want to\nremain in London over the\nEaster break but still have to\npay rent for a term-time\naddress you can still claim\nthe money back through\nStandard Housing Benefit.\nc) If you have ever been\nemployed: In addition to\nHousing Benefit those who\nhave been employed in the\nrelevant tax year, see the\nnext section, you may be .\nentitled to Unemployment\nBenefit.\nHow to Claim And What To\nClaim:\nUnemployment Benefit\nWho is eligible: Anyone\nwho has paid or been\ncredited with National\nInsurance contributions on\nearnings of at least \u00a31767\nin the tax year 1984/85.\nTo claim: Go to your local\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice on the first weekday\nof the vacation and 'sign\non' as unemployed and\navailable for work. They\nwill need proof of your\nidentity and will need to\nknow your National\nInsurance number. As\nUnemployment Benefit is\nnot dependent on income\nbut on eligibility it does not\nmatter that you receive a small sum from the LEA ie\nyour grant. This will not\neffect the amount you will\nreceive.\nIt is worth noting that\nUnemployment Benefit can\nbe claimed from any\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice in the area you\nhappen to be staying at\nwhen you become eligible.\nIf you are claiming\nUnemployment Benefit you\nshould be able to claim\nStandard Housing Benefit.\nStaying in London\nCertificated Housing Benefit\nThis form of Housing\nBenefit is only available to\nthose about to 'sign on' as\nunemployed and available\nfor work in the area in\nwhich they are paying rent.\nIt is also dependent on\nyour eligibility for\nsupplementary benefit. You\nwill not receive Certificated\nHousing Benefit if you are\nreceiving Unemployment\nBenefit.\nTo claim: Go to the local\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice on the first week day\nof the vacation and 'sign\non' as unemployed and\navailable for work. If you\nare not eligible for\nUnemployment Benefit\nyour papers will\nautomatically be forwarded\nto the local DHSS. The\nUnemployment Benefit\nOffice will tell you if and\nwhan they want you to\n'sign on' again and will give\nyou form B1 to take or\nsend to your local DHSS\noffice. The DHSS may call\nyou for an interview and\nwill need proof of identity\nand of your financial\nsituation ie recent bank\nstatement etc. The DHSS\nwill pay a basic living\nallowance and will\nauthorize the local Housing\nAuthority to pay\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit. The Housing\nAuthority will send out\nforms to be completed, to\nbe returned with proof of\nrent and rates. Payments of\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit are considered a priority and should be\nprocessed within the\nfourteen days though they\nrarely are. The main\ndisadvantage of the\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit system is its\ndependence on eligibility\nfor Supplementary Benefit\nwhich excludes a large\nproportion of students.\nWho will qua lift y: Students\nnot receiving grants should\nqualify. Other students will\nhave to rely on the\npossibility of being classed\nas a 'householder' by the\nDHSS. There are three\ntypes of Supplementary\nBenefit\u2014householder, joint\nhouseholder and own-householder. A householder is defined as\nsomeone who is soley\nresponsible for meeting all\nthe costs of their\n'household' and they will\nreceive a slightly higher\nrate of Supplementary\nBenefit.\nNon-Householder Most\nstudents liv ng with a landlady/landlord will be\nclassed as non-householders and as the\nliving element in the grant\nis a slightly higher amount\nthan the non-householder\nrate, you will not qualify for\nSupplementary Benefit and\nwill not be eligible for\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit.\nJoint Householder:\nStudents sharing flats will\nbe classed as joint\nhouseholders.\nUnfortunately, you will not\nbe able to receive\nSupplementary Benefit as\nthe living element in the\ngrant is a slightly higher\namount than the joint\nhouseholder rate, therefore\nyou will not receive\nCertificated Housing\nBenefit.\nHouseholder: However,\nsome students liv ng in\nindividual beds its may be\nclassed as 'householders'\nand as the student vacation\nelement is lower than the\n'householder' rate you\nshould be eligible for a small weekly sum from the\nDHSS and in these cases\nthe DHSS will authorise\npayment of Certificate\nHousing Benefit.\nThe term 'Householder' is\nloose and ill-defined and\nopen to appeal but\nobviously the DHS S Will\nseek to classify students as\nnon-householder if\npossible.\nHousing Benefit\nSupplement\nIf you do not qualify for\nSupplementary Benefit, the\nDHSS should still make an\nassessment for Housing\nBenefit Supplement. They\nwill send you a standard\nHousing Benefit claim form\nto send to the local\nHousing Authority but it\nwill be marked with an\n'excess income figure'\nwhich in the long term will\nprovide you with slightly\nmore benefit than if you\napproached the Housing\nAuthority direct.\nWhat to claim if you are\nleaving London for the\nvacation.\nStandard Housing Benefit\nSome of you will\nhopefully already have\nsubmitted claims for\nHousing Benefit during\nterm-time. During the\nEaster vacation your official\nincome drops to \u00a327.50pw and there is no rent\nelement included in this\nsum, so if you claim\nstandard Housing Benefit\nover the vacation you will\nreceive considerably more\nthan term-time. Students\nwho were not e lig ile in\nterm-time using this\nsystem, should be eligible\nfor some money back in\nthe vacation due to the\ndrop in in ome. This benefit\ndoesn't involve any 'signing\non' and can be paid even if\nyou are not resident in your\nterm-time address over the\nvacation.\nTo claim-if you have\nalready submitted a claim\nin term-time:\nIn theory if you have\nalready submitted a claim,\nstating term dates you\nshould automatically be\nreassessed. In practise this\nrarely happens. It is wise to\nwrite to the Housing\nBenefit Office and state\nthat it is now vacation time\nand that as your weekly\nincome is only \u00a327.50pw you wish to have your\nHousing Benefit ree assed for the period 22nd March20th April 1986. Also inform\nthem that you will not be\nworking over the vacation.\nThey will send you a declaration to this effect,\nfor you to sign. Students\nwho have already claimed\nin term-time to\nHammersmith and Fulham\nshould call into the Student\n(continued on next page)\n18 Wednesday 19 March FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Recently I have been\nthinking that death might\nbe a refreshing change. No\nmore of this running\naround trying to help\npeople who don't care\nwhether or not you help\nthem. No more trying to\nimprove things that people\nwill hate you for improving.\nNo more loving or hating.\nNo more tears.\n'All the world's a stage\nand all the men and women\nmerely players.'\nTrue, but how much\nbetter must it be to sit back\nand watch the players\nsuffer pain sorrow and joy\nknowing that you will\nremain unaffected as the\nfinal curtain slides down.\nWondering, perhaps, how\nmany of the characters who\nhad graced the stage just\nseconds earlier had eagerly\nanticipated the end of the\nshow, their destruction. Or\neven the number who had\nleft early, who had chosen\nnot to stay to the end. To\nthe watcher their suicides\nwould be irrelevant \u2014\ndetracting little or nothing\nfrom the overall\nperformance, although the\nother players might have to\nwork around the gap,\ndevising new cues to cover\nup for the loss.\nTheatre is, for me at\nleast, the most exiting and\nterrifying art form. A good\nplay will attack the\naudience like a warrior with\nthe flat of his broadsword,\nleaving the audience\nbreathless, worried and a bit dazed, but not seriously\nwounded. The theatre-goer\nis always free to leave.\nThere is no obligation to\nsee a play through. Trying\nto leave real life is rather\nmore difficult, although\nsuicide does seem to be\ngetting fashionable.\nPerhaps, like me, you\nfind that theatre puts you in\nthat enviable position of the\nobserver. Relief to one's own life, even if only\nbriefly. Perhaps the follies\nof other people's minds,\nonce out in the open, will\nsoothe the memory of the\nfollies of your own. Relax. I don't want to die.\nWhen rec commending theatre at the moment, one\nis quite tempted to give the\ngeneral advice.'Go to the\nNational'. At the moment\nthere are two shows at the\nNational Theatre that I'm dying to see. The first, in\nthe Olivier, is BrecM's Threepenny Opera, starring\nTim Curry as Mack the\nKnife. Many of you will\nremember Mr Curry as the\nunforgettably sexy Frank N Furter from the film of The\nRocky Horror Show. Bertolt\nBrecht is one of my favorite\nFELIX\nplaywrights as he is\nprogressive, direct, and is\noccasionally as fatalistic as\nI am becoming.\nThreepenny Opera was a collaboration between\nBrecht and Kurt Weill \u2014\nshould definitely be a show\nto put a little zest in your\nlife.\nBrighton Beach Memoirs,\nat the Cottesloe this time,\nis written by another of the\nbest of the modern\nplaywrights. Nell Simon is\nthe man who wrote The\nOdd Couple, The Goodbye\nGirl, and Barefoot In the\nPark, among others. This\nplay is largely\nautobiographical, set at\nBrighton Beach, New York,\nand concerning a JewishAmerican teenage boy\ngrowing up in 1937.\nFrances de la Tour plays\nthe obligatory Jewish\nmother, and very nicely too\nI understand. The got rave\nreviews in the States, and\nshould travel very well.\nMost Neil Simon plays do.\nBill Bryden, the famous\nScottish dramatist, has\ndirected this one... yet\nanother reason for it to be\nworth missing Dynasty for.\nAnother American play in\nLondon at the moment is\nGlengarry Glen Ross.\nProbably best to stay away\nfrom this one if you're as\ndepressed as I am. A Broadway hit, this play, by\nDavid Mamet, takes a hard\nlook at the dog-eat-dog\nworld of the business man.\nThis is an NT production\nbut is now playing at the\nMermaid Theatre SE1.\nEnjoy.\nThe next show that I am\nyearning to see is The J Apple Cart by that most\nIrish of gentlemen, George\nBernard Shaw. This play\nconcerns a king's fight to\nkeep his throne under\nrather unusual, but\ncertainly not revolutionary, j circumstances. The king is I played by Pefer O 'Toole,\nwho heads a cast of some\nof the most respected\nnames in theatre, including\nSusannah York, who plays\nhis powerful mistress. This j is one of those plays that\nleaves you with quite a bit\nto think about. Presently\nplaying at the Haymarket\nTheatre SW1.\nLastly, a show that will\nleave you thinking about\nabsolutely nothing of any\nimportance, but will amuse\nyou nonetheless. Noel\nCoward has never been\nre known ed for his gravity.\nHis play Blithe Spirit is no\nexception to this rule and is\nas witty and sharp as you\nwould expect from such a man. It has as its television- j famous stars Simon Cadell, i Joanna Lumley and Jane\nAsher who have Hl-de-hl,\nThe New Avengers, and\nsome Agatha Christies to\ntheir respective credits.\nGood entertainment value,\nas long as you're not\nlooking for any meat. Blithe\nSpirit is playing at the\nVaudeville Theatre, WC2.\nThe unfortunate thing\nabout theatre is that one\nalways has to leave at the\nend. Ones life, problems,\nimpending decisions,and\nheartaches, all return within\na few minutes. If you are\nseparated from your loved\none, anxious about an\nexam or short of money,\nthe play can only act as a temporary distraction. But\nthen it is interesting to\nthink that one might only\nbe leaving one theatre to\nact in a larger one. The\nsame tr ad ge dies, dramas\nand farces take place\noutside, just on a more\nfrightening scale. I can\noffer nothing but empathy,\nguilt anger, and love to this\nworld. Let the curtain fall,\nbut not quite yet.\nWednesday 19 March 23\n\n"

The\ni morning foursomes proved\nI to be IC's down fall. In the\ntop match, Dave Tierney\nand Jon Gamblin managed\nto overcome come erratic\nplay to force a half. Mark\nas and the powerful\npost grad went down on the\n18 despite some\nj inspirational putting by the\n| former.

An out of\nform Mark Cas could do\nlittle against an in practise\nopponent, and Dave\nTierney, Chris Harrison and\nthe powerful post grad failed in their attempt to\nbeat the course and their\nopponents.\nThe best win of the day\ncame from Huw Jones,\nplaying the only female\nmember of the Durham\nteam despite some\npersistent hooking into the\nbushes, he managed to\nscore well and slipped in\nfrom behind, almost holing\nin one in the process.

But once the IC\nforwards woke up to the\ntask and began to feed the\ntalented back line the result\nwas never in doubt. First\nhalf tries came from\nHutchinson and Secombe,\nHutchinson in particular\nworking the blind side to\ngood effect.\nIn the second half,\nalthough with a breeze\nagainst them, IC despite\nscrappy handling at times,\ncontinued to move the ball\nwide and support\neffectively.

It\nwas a feast of running\nrugby and everyone wanted\na nibble! Tremendous\nsupport play was the key to\nICs resounding victory\nwhich consisted of nine\ntries-eight converted, and\none penalty goal. The try\nscorers included, the\n'Blonde Bombshell,' Parker'\n(3), Paul Seccombe (7),\nBoogie Woogie Goetz (27)\nRob 'Voracious' Hargrove,\nand the Irish leprechaun,\nMike Anderson.\nLadies Hockey\nULU Plate Final\n| Ladies hockey, tired and\n' hungover as they were after\n| the previous evenings\nAnnual Dinner, played at\nMotspur park on Sunday\nI morning in the UL U plate\nfinal.

There are\npressures enough from\ncollege life: the withdrawal\nof a service which could be\na student's only ec s ape from a sense of total\nisolation is unthinkable,\nespecially on the grounds\nof funding alone.\nAs long as there are\nvolunteers willing to train\nand subsequently donate\ntheir time and energy to\nmanning the Nightline\noffice it must stay open.\nThe valuable information\nservice is an asset to all\nstudents, but in this case it\nis imperative that the\nminority's needs are\nprovided for; it would be at rad ged y that this college\nin particular can ill afford if\nNightline were to close.\nYours faithfully,\nSue Whittaker\nPhysics 3\nTaig It Away...\nDear FELIX,\nI am glad that Penny\nOttway is quite content\nwith the mixture of\nstudents that make up\nImperial College and I am\nsure that plenty of others\nfeel the same way. I do\nwish that this was true of\nall students\u2014but\nunfortunately it is not. The\nvast majority of those\nstudents who bothered to\nturn up to the relevant\nU GM saw the Dreaded\nRatio as enough of a problem to necessitate the\npost of Women's Officer;\nnot one spoke against the\nidea on the grounds that\nthere is no problem. From\nthe response I have had\nfrom many students (and\nstaff) both female and male\nsince then I am sure that\nmost people agree that IC\nwould be a happier place\nwith a few more women\naround.\nAs I volunteered to do\nthe job of Women's Officer,\nof course I have mentioned\nThe Ratio on several\noccasions. This does not\nmean that I( or those who\nagree with me) spend all\nmy time weeping and\nwailing over the issue\u2014I simply believe that\nreasonable, positive action\nis better than ignoring\nproblems (however\nimportant you consider\nthem to be) in the hope\nthat they will go away.\nFinally, I trust that Penny\nwill be amongst the first to\nvolunteer to visit her old\nSchool at College's expense to encourage\nother schoolgirls to come\nto IC, as mentioned in last\nweek's FELIX.\nYours,\nChristine Taig\nWomen's Officer!\nGood Old Opsoc\nDear Sir,\nI wish to congratulate\nImperial College Operatic\nSociety on reaching the\ngrand old age of thirty!\nSince 1956 its hard-working\nmembers have been giving\nenormous pleasure to\naudiences here and on\ntheir summer tours to\nBudleigh Salterton, Devon.\nI have greatly enjoyed their\nperformances every year\nsince 1969 and quickly\nfound that their amateur\n,.io duct ions had much\nmore life and s ponte ne it y than those of the\nprofessional D 'Oryly Carte\ncompany\nIt is astonishing how\nmuch action they cram into\nsuch a small stage, such as\nthe triple sword fight in the\ncurrent Princess Ida. The\nimaginative sets (eg\nYeoman of the Guard,\n1983) , colourful costumes\n(eg lol an the,1973 and\n1984) and original\nOpsoc's most recent show\nproductions, such as the\ncleverly updated Grand\nDuke, 1985, are a delight.\nThe acting and dancing are\nvery lively, both for the\nchorus and the soloists.\nSinging quality is\nsomewhat variable, with the\nladies frequently better\nthan the men, but the very\nspirited performances often\ncompensate for occasional\nlack of vocal finesse.\nCertain soloists (especially\nfemales) have been of\nprofessional standard and\ntraining, making it harder\nfor indigenous talent to\nshow'well, but some\nCollege members have\nbeen outstandingly good.\nThe company obviously\ninspires loyalty, with\nsingers, directors and\nmusicians taking part many\nyears after leaving Imperial\nCollege.\nMy all-time favourite is\nthe 1976 Utopia Limited,\nwhere the superbly funny\nChristo Minstrel scene was\nencOred many times. IC\nOpsoc has been\nparticularly good at giving\naudiences a chance to see\nrarer, 'less commercial'\noperettas, such as the\nSorcerer, Princess Ida, the\nGrand Duke, and Utopia\nLimited. They have\nperformed works by Gilbert\nand Sullivan, Offenbach,\nand others, always with\ngreat style and en tusi as m. Long may they continue to\ngive up so much of their\nspare time to enrich the life\nof the College.\nCongratulations Opsoc!\nYours sincerely,\nDr B Lamb\nH ft\nft\nIS\nTRAVEL \u00a9\nft\nt G(A0UL U Travel, Imperial College,\nSherfield Building,\nPrince Consort Road, London SW7.

To do\nthis they have had to get\ninvolved in finding news.\nNews Editor Dave Burbage\nwas extremely worried that\nyoung impressionable first\nyears might believe\neverything the sabbaticals\nsaid so he produced a 'guide to the sabbaticals'\nfor his team. In this guide\nthe news hounds are told\nto 'speak slowly' to Carl\nBurgess who tends,\naccording to Mr Burbage,\nto say that nothing news\nworthy happens. If this\nhappens the news hounds\nare told to ask Mr Burgess\nwhat he has been doing.\nDave Kingston is\ndescribed as 'rambling'. He\napparently only tells you\nsomething useful after 15\nminutes of rambling.\n. 't's good to see at IC, a place with an amazing\nreputation for acceptance\nand understanding of\nhomosexuals that gays\nreceive the respect they\ndeserve.

'One of those is\nlast weeks break'.\n1\n,J> f you ever go in the FELIX\noffice, you will have\nnoticed Hugh Southey\nwalking around with his\nthumb in plaster. Mr\nSouthey first cracked his\nthumb last week playing\nhockey. This injury was\nhealing well when Mr\nSouthey fractured and\ndislocated it while playing\nhockey. When the second\nbreak was X rayed the\nWhen he returned home he\nwas in a bad way and so\nwent straight to bed.\nUnfortunately Dave decided\nto go sleepwalking at 2am while still pissed. The\ninevitable happened and\nDave ended up flat on his\nface in a pool of blood.\nDave then decided to\nintroduce himself to Ms\nPeirce and her room mate.\nLet's hope the two of them\nhave as close a relationship\nnext year.\nDave gave up drinking at\nthe start of this year after\nafter he went to two parties\non successive weekends\nand ended up drunk trying\nto chat up friend's girlfriends. May be he\nthinks he stands a better\nchance of success if he\ndoesn't drink.\nHugh Southey shows what\napl on ker he really is...\n1 resident-elect Christine\nTaig seems to be one of\nthese boring people who\nnever does anything\nvaguely funny (more likely\nshe hides her mistakes\nwell\u2014Ed)! Fortunately (for\nFELIX) Deputy Presidentelect Jackie Peirce seems a lot more interesting. Ms\nPeirce's fondness for a pint\n(or ten) is well known. After\na heavy night Ms Peirce is\na changed person. The\nnormally quiet and refined\nJackie becomes an animal.\nIn her first year Ms Peirce\nwent on the piss with RCS. On returning to Evelyn\nGardens she felt a little hot\nand sweaty and so she\ndecided to have a shower.\nUnfortunately she was\nhaving a very interesting\nconversation with various\nRCS hacks including ex-RCS Hon Sec Paul\nBloomfield. Fortunately Ms\nPeirce managed to\npur sua de the RCS hacks to\njoin her in the shower.\n9\n\\ er hap s it's fortunate for\nMs Peirce that FELIX Editor\nelect Dave Jones is an old\nfriend. Dave is possibly the\nonly sabbatical IC has ever\nhad who doesn't drink. This\nwasn't always the case,\nthough, in Dave's first year\nhe went on a pub crawl.\nave you ever wondered\nwhat goes on in the Polish\nYacht Club-the noisy disco\non Exhibition Road that\nkeeps half of Princes\nGardens awake every\nweekend. The Club always\nseems to run the best\nparties around College.\nFELIX Editor Hugh\nSouthey, Guilds Hockey\nCaptain Pete DrummondSmith and Mech Eng 1st year Brendan Farmer\ndecided to investigate last\nSaturday. Carrying a barrel\nof Beer stolen from the\nHockey Club dinner they\nwandered up to the\nenormous bouncers saying\n'we heard it was a bring a bottle party so we brought\na barrel'. The amazed\nbouncers admitted our\ngallant three. Mr Southey\nimmediately found a woman to dance with.\nUnfortunately for Mr\nSouthey his comrades\nbecome worried about the\nfate of their beer and\ndragged Mr Southey from\nthe dance floor.\nBLASTER BILL |\nRELAXES l HIS PRICES!!\nSPRING SPECTACULARS FROM\nTHE FLIGHT SPECIALISTS\nTAMESt tE TRAVEL LTD9611324224 Manchester\n11-556 7766 7 8 9 BinisfHaBi\nII 741 9666 Lomm\nA BT A/ A TO L ACCMS/VISA\nEDY'SI So this is what Quentin does]\non the side\n'I didn't expect anything\nlike this', said someone\nnext to me during the\ninterval of Kennedy's Children. According to the\nprogramme, the play is 'a diversion from traditional\ntheatre', and indeed anyone\nexpecting anything like a curtain (or dialogue even)\nwas likely to be\ndisappointed. Like\nWoodstock, A Chorus Line,\nThe Deerhunter, and a few\nother movies rolled into\none, Kennedy's Children is\na play about the Sixties,\nwritten in the Seventies and\nrevised in the Eighties.\nWe enter through the\nmist into a magnificent\nreconstruction of a bar on\nNew York's Lower East\nSide (aptly named,\naccording to the\ncustomised neon sign,\n'Heroes') where images of\nKennedy, Monroe, etc are\nprojected above the bar.\nThere sits Wanda, the first\nand last character to speak\nin the play, and the only\none whose dreams (and\nmind) remain intact\nthrough it. Liz Holford\ncasts a confused (and\nbeautifully controlled) eye\non the antics of the\ncharacters unfolding\nthemselves before her. At\nfirst sight, the scars of the\nSixties are most obvious on\nMark, a Vietnam war\nveteran spending his life in\na Methadon clinic, and\nRona, a rebel with a cause\nand cynical acid-freak later.\nAlthough he hardly moves,\nit proves impossible to take\nyour eyes off the fixed\nstare of Mike Foulds as\nMark, while Sam Duerden\nmanages the difficult task\nof remaining entirely\ncredible while staggering\naround angrily discovering\nthat there are no longer\nany openings for a professional hippy.\nMeanwhile, both Tessa\nHoxey as Carla and John\nBurgess as Sparger ooze\ndecaying sex as kids who\nstarted out waiting to be\nthe new Marilyn Monroe\nand end up wanting to be\ndead. And it's not just\nLance Holland's hair which\nis slick about his\nperformance as the\nBartender. This was a superbly understated cast,\nbacked up to the hilt by a technical crew who missed\nno opportunity to create a spectacle.

    "content": "Student Disillusionment\nBy Pete Klemperer\nThe Reasons Behind Student Disillusionment\n(including extracts from the\nBoard of Studies agenda\n4.12.85 Paper B:'A Response To the Green\nPaper').\nThe Government has\nrecently produced a 'Green\nPaper' delineating their\nplans for 'the development\nof Higher Education into\nthe 1990's'. Further\nsubstantial sacrifices to the\nend of the decade are\nbeing demanded of\nUniversities.\nThe resourcing of Higher\nEducation has produced a crisis which will enforce\ndifficult and painful\ndecisions by both\ngovernment and individual\ninstitutions. It will be a tragedy for Britain as well\nas several generations of\nstudents if these decisions\nare taken while relations\nremain not merely sour but\nhostile.\nFunding is decreasing\nfrom the Government. This\nis why the AUT went on\nstrike. With accelerating\ntechnology, the amount of\nmaterial to put in a degree\ncourse increases every\nyear. Lecturers talk faster,\nover un more and are often\nobliged to skim over\nimportant material. There\nare four alternatives to this\nuncomfortable situation;\n1) Increase the duration of\nthe courses\u2014but this\nre qui ries extra funding\nwhich is not forthcoming.\n(Infact the reverse is true).\n2 Reduce the standards of\nthe degree courses,\ndamaging our international\nreputation and\ncontravening the Charter\nunder which the College\nwas originally set up;\nnamely for the provision of\n'The highest specialized\ninstruction, and...the fullest\nequipment of the most\nadvanced training and\nresearch in various\nbranches of sciences,\nespecially in the application\nto industry.\n3 Reorganise the courses,\nmake them more efficient\nand improve teaching\nstandards so that students\ncan still achieve high\nstandards without having to\nwork so hard, or\n4 make the students work\nharder.\nObviously (unfortunately)\nalternative 1 to increase the\nduration of the courses is\noutside our control.\nAlternative 2 to reduce our\nstandards is to be avoided\nat all costs because it\nrepresents a reduction in\nthe number of well-educated people in our\nsociety, which is the only\nreasonable way to mitigate\npower-crazy politicians and\nto remain economically\ncompetitive. This leaves us\nwith 3 and 4 reorganising\nand the workload-the\nplaces where we as\nstudents can have real\ninfluence. It is up to us to\nhelp the College and\ndepartments to fulfil 3 as\nfar as possible by proper\nuse of staff-student\ncommittees and all other\nAcademic Affairs.\nObviously we should resist\nworking harder at all\ncosts\u2014already we work for\ntoo much of the time.\nHowever when we make a complaint, we should bear\nin mind the alternatives,\nwhich may sometimes\nappear so grim as to\ncounter our demands. In all\ncases we should push for\nthe highest teaching\nstandards; lecturers should\nbe trained and given plenty\nof feedback. Judging by\nthe state of RCS, the\nCollege deserves to be\nberated for waiting until the\nlast possible moment\nbefore they have to start\nconsidering revising\ncourses (rather than just\nmaking us work harder),\nbut now that they are, the\ntime is ripe for us to begin\nto co-operate more\nthoroughly, ft is a chance\nfor us as students to prove\nhow useful it is to let us\nhelp decide the future of\nthe College, an opportunity\nwhich for the sake of all\npresent and future students\nnot least of all ourselves\nshould not be missed. We\nmust now begin to petition\nthe College admins t ration to make use of the\nresponsibility which we are\nnow ready and able to take,\nby enhancing existing\nchannels of communication\n(staff-student committees)\nand recognising the vital\nrole that Academic\nRepresentatives could play\nin departmental affairs if\nonly they had the time. The\nCollege could provide for\nthis by offering a humanities course in\n'Administration and College\nCommittee Structure',\ntowards which credit could\nbe gained by collecting,\nassimilating and presenting\nfeedback from students at\ngrass-roots level.\nI have made this\nproposition to the\nUndergraduate Studies\nCommittee before and will\nbe restating it on Tuesday\n11th March. You are invited\nto make criticisms and\nsuggestions to me on this\nand any other idea.\nPeter Klemperer\nRCS AAO (Physics 3)\nIran\nAuthor's Name Wit held\nThis February marked the\nseventh anniversary of the\nIranian Revolution. The\nrevolution rocked the world\nand it was a particularly\nsevere shock for the West.\nSince 1979, however, the\nmedia coverage of Iran has\nbeen patchy and erratic.\nThis has lead to much\nconfusion and many have\nbeen misled.\nToday Iran is a brutal\ndictatorship, ruled by a fanatical mob of religious\ndespots. Human rights are\nnon-existent, and all\nopposition to the regime\nhas been systematically\ncrushed. There have been\nthousands of executions\nand there are tens of\nthousands of political\nprisoners. Such indication\nof human rights are\ncommon place in many\ncountries, but what is\n'special' about Iran is the\nparticular brutality of the\nKhomeni regime and the\nreturn to the values of the\nFourteenth Century. This is\nillustrated by the way\nwomen have been treated.\nWomen have to cover\nevery part of their body,\nexcept their eyes, when in\n'Ghesas' regulations,\nwomen have been offical ly recognised as being\ninferior to men; for\nexample, the evidence of\none man is considered to\nhave greater weight than\nthe evidence of two women\nin a 'court of law'.\nThe Iran-Iraq war has so\npublic. Disobeyed of this\nIslamic law would mean a visit to the local 'Komiteh',\nfollowed by imprisonment\nand/or flogging. Women\nare not permitted to wear\nmake-up and it is illegal for\nthem to be accompanied by\nany man except a very\nclose relative. Furthermore,\nunder the infamous\nfar cost the lives of up to\n500,000 Iranians, it has\nresulted in billions of\ndollars of material damage.\nYet the offical slogan in\nIran is still 'War, until\nvictory'. This victory is\nsometimes defined as the\nend of the Iraqi regime,\nsometimes as the capture\nof Jerusalem, and\nsometimes as the\ndestruction of the super\npowers. Meanwhile the\nkilling continues.\nThe situation in Iran\nforced hundreds of\nthousands of Iranians into\nexile. However, even\noutside Iran, the thugs of\nthe Khomeni regime\ncontinue to harass\nmembers of the opposition.\nThere have been numerous\nexamples of unrestrained\nphysical attacks on exiled\ndemocrats.\nAt the moment, there is\ngrowing international\nopposition to the Khomeni\nregime. So much so that\nthe regime has been forced\nback on to the defensive on\nhuman rights issues. It is\nimportant to keep up this\npressure in an organised\nmanner. It is a policy of\nULU to co-operate with the\norganisation of Democratic\nYouth and Students of Iran\n(ODYSI) and the\nCommittee for the Defence\nof the Iranian People's Right (CODIR). It is\nimportant to support these\norgans at ions and avoid\nseparatist or ex clu s is t actions.\nName supplied but wit held by request.\nFELIX Wednesday 19 March 7\n\n"
