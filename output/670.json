    "content": "letters W kW. Cottle\nWaffle\nDear Pallab\nI hope you will prove your\neditorial integrity by printing\nthis.\nHere are a few words about\nmy recent involvement in the\nelection for FELIX Editor,\nwhich I feel are in order at this\ntime. I still believe I did not\ninfringe the Union publicity\nrules in any clearly obvious\nway. Further, I believe the\nvigour with which some people\nin this College regard rules and\nconstitutions as sacred in some\nway, as a general malaise which\naffects the whole structure of\nICU. It seems as if, in too many\nsituations, doing things as\nconventions says or as they\nhave always been done, is\nregarded as a sure fire formula\nfor success. IC has a traditionally moderate union, but\ntoo often these days this\nappears to translate as bureau-crat ic, pompous and apathetic,\nsuch an attitude will not be of\nmuch use in preventing College\ndoing drastic things to rents.\nI should point out before I go\nany further that at no time was I consulted by the elections com-mitte e, in any way, about the\narticle in Guildsheet I am held\nresponsible for, and in which\nmy principle involvement was\nthe typing. My only crime as far\nas I can see is that I did not go\nout of my way to prevent its\npublication. I suggestion that\nthe election committee may\nhave been less correct than they\nbelieved, as a result of their\nenthusiasm.\nAs far as certain letters of\nappeal are concerned I wish to\nmake it clear that they were\nforged. I had intended until the\nday of the U GM not to appeal\nfurther in order not to extend\nalready overlong proceedings.\nI would also like to make a few points about my object in\nstanding as a candidate. I did\nnot particularly want to be\nFELIX Editor. I chose the post\nto be a joke candidate far as\nthere were already too many for\nthe presidency. This all arose as '\na result of a number of people\nexpressing the following views.\nFirst and most obvious that\nmost of what is presented to the\n'average student' is a load of\ntotal rhetoric and bears the\nsame relationship to the truth as\npage three of the Sun does to\ninvestigative journalism. Second, that no one should be I Let ler^ to^ eJ Editor I3J\nunder any sort of illusion about\nthe type of person standing. The\ntruth is that people like Aidon\nJennery are probably more\nrealistic about themselves than\nthe likes of mess rs Bull and\nSimion. The College administrators are professionals at their\njobs (catering excluded of\ncourse) and it will require more\nthan experience of sitting on\nhack committees to influence\nthem greatly on matters such as\nresidence and control of Union\nbars. Remember if John Smith\nmakes a concession the first\nreaction should be to question\nhis motive rather than claim a victory.\nHaving said all this I particularly wish Dave Parry luck\nwith his stated intentions and\ncannot stress too strongly that\neveryone should try to get\ninvolved on these matters.\nLastly I would like to make\nclear that none of the comments\nwhich I personally am responsible, should be regarded as a criticism of what you have\ntried to make of FELIX. We\nhave seen promises made for\nnext year, and it will be\ninteresting to see how practical\nreality compares. Certainly\nanybody wishing to make the\nsort of attacks, which have been\nlevelled against FELIX should\nbe very sure they could do\nbetter. This said I am appalled\nat last week's letters page, and\nin particular the fact that you\nchose to print a religious advert\nas a space filler, while stating in\nthe manifesto section that I did\nnot submit any material. This is\nnot quite true as I placed a short\nletter stating my position into\nthe copy tray while it was not\nmore than three feet from your\nface, I will admit however that it\nwas four minutes after the copy\ndeadline (most important if\nthings are to be correct to the\nletter). Nevertheless I was denied any voice at all and you did\nnot do yourself justice. I wish,\nto repeat here one point from\n\u2022that letter, that the section of\nPaul Simion's manifesto attributed to me, was not in any way\nmy work (I seem to have a big\nprobe m with this sort of thing).\nI hope those people who\nPage 2 \\\nregarded me as a mental retard\nwill see their way clear to give\nme a chance to revive my\ncredibility.\nYous sincerely\nMark Cottle\nSpanner Editor\n(After such a profound and well\nwritten letter Mark I cant imagine anyone thinking of you as a mental retard-Ed.)\nPeanuts\nDear Pallab\nWith regard to the sabbatical\nelections, not yet knowing the\nresults of course, could the\nelections committee -ask Ian\nBull if he obtained copyright\nfrom Schulz; and if not has he\nbroke the election rules?\nYours\nK Evans, K Fearnley, La la trou, E McDonnel.\nPhysics 3\nNose\nNonsense\nDear Ed\nJust the other day I remarked\nto quite a close associate\nthat I had been blowing my\nnose on frequent occasions\nrecently. They replied that they\ndidn't tell me every time they\nblew theirs! Well! This led me to\nponder the subject of social\nintercourse with in depth\nanalysis on bogey subjects of\nour time and culture(s).I reasoned that my colleague\nmust surely have been\nembarrassed by the stinging\nhonesty of the remark, and,\nunused to such an open attitude\nbecame slightly offensive,\nwhich was obviously a reaction\nthey could not help and, which Is y mpa this e and understand.\nMy point is that we should all\ntry to embrace each others\nquirks a bit more and not limit\nourselves to just certain parts of\nthe body. Remember, noses fit\ninto things too. Now, if you'll\nexcuse me I 'll have to blow\u2014\nAaaachoooo\nPeter Dawson\nBible\nVindicated\nDear Pallab\nI was very interested to read\nin your last issue MrT Sheriffs\nletter concerning the existence\nof God. On this point Mr Sheriff and I are totally in\nagreement. However, I would\nlike to clear up amis under standing. In his letter he asserts\nthat the Old Testament and the\nGospel are not intact in their\noriginal form. In the British\nmuseum there are manuscripts\nof the Gospels that date from a time only shortly after the Life\nof Christ. These are the manuscripts used in translating the\nEnglish Bible. It is interesting to\nnote that there are about 100\nmanuscripts of the New Testament, whereas undisputed\nGreek poetry such as Homer's Iliad have very few reliable\nmanuscripts.\nAlso, when the dead sea\n'scrolls were discovered it was\nfound that they corresponded\nalmost exactly to later manu-scripts, and if such a standard is\nmaintained then the Old Testament is trustworthy. (The\nDead Sea Scrolls predate\nChrist.)\nPerhaps Mr Sheriff would be\ninterested in attending his departmental Bible study, where\nhe would be welcome to discuss\nthese things in greater length.\nYours sincerely\nS Bisset\nCiv Eng 2\nInsignificant\nNobody\nDear Pallab\nI'm writing to thank FELIX for dispelling the misapprehension I'd been under for the\nlast nineteen years that my\nname was Simon Redlich\nI was relieved to discover at\nlast that my name is in fact\n'Paul Richardson, as reported in\nlast week's FELIX under the\npicture of the new RCS Exec.\nMy only remaining fear is\nthat perhaps my name is Simon\nRedlich but I have a long lost\nidentical twin called Paul\nRichardson walking around\nCollege who is to be RCS HJ T next year in place of myself.\nCould your team of ace\ninvestigative reporters resolve\nthis quandary for me?\nYours\nSimon Redlich/Paul Richardson\nPossibly RCS HJT 1984/5\nI Friday, March 9, 19841 I FELIX\n\n"

The last few seconds\nsaw IC defending heroically with Burnett\nmaking another excellent save. The final\nwhistle could not have come too soon for\nthose watching.\nAlthough unknown in U AU competition,\nIC had posted a warning to the other teams\nwhen drawing 11-11 with the much-fancied\nBirmingham side in Friday evening's first\ngame. The obvious attractions of the hotel\nbar were ignored in view of Saturday\nmorning's game against the holders,\nLiverpool. Showing an improved performance, IC led 6-2 at the end of the second\nquarter. In the third, IC lost some of their\nrhythm and Liverpool fought back to trail 7-6. The fourth period saw IC re-assert their\nauthority to finish 12-9 winners.\nSheffield had already established themselves as 'lame ducks' but their weaknesses\nwere only fully exposed by Imperial. IC led 6-0 after five minutes and, even using f re que n* substitutions to rest their top players, won\ncomfortably by 17-7.\nIC's success is a tribute to Geoff Hurley's coaching and motivating the squad. The\nSquad's fitness was superior to the other\nteams and was a major factor considering\nthat some of the games lasted up to an hour.\nHurley's ability and control surpassed all\nother players. Eastman was superb at the\n'chief executioner' of moves originated by\nHurley while Casini's experience and shooting were invaluable. In goals Burnett\nproduced some miraculous saves when all\nseemed lost.\nPW LD Points\nImperial 4 3 0 ! 7\nBirmingham 4 2 0 2 6\nLiverpool 4 2 2 0 4\nLoughborough 4 1 2 1 3\nSheffield 4 0 4 0 0\nIC Water Polo U AU Champions Few teams can ever have made as spectacular\ns an entry to a competition as IC in the U AU water-polo championships. Having qualified\nfor the five-team final competition as\nSouthern Area representatives, IC achieved\nthe ultimate honour in student water-polo by\nbeating Loughborough 11-10 to clinch the\nWM Gibbons Cup at the first attempt.\nThe tournament was organised on a league\nbasis and by the start of their last game the\nsituation facing IC was clear. Victory over\nLoughborough would win the tournament, a draw would leave the result in doubt until\nLiverpool played Birmingham and defeat\nwould hand the competition to Birmingham.\nIn a hard-fought game neither team was\never more than one goal ahead and, inspired\nby the crowd, Loughborough levelled the\nscores at 9-9 by the end of the third quarter.\nWithin two minutes of the restart Loughborough scored, to the obvious delight of the\ncrowd. For much of the quarter both defences\ncoped with all attacks. When Eastman, in\ndevastating form during ea lier games, fluffed\na relatively simple chance and Hurley,\nequally effective in controlling play, missed a penalty, IC's hopes seemed to have faded.\nThe score was still 10-9 when the last\nminute bell rang.

However the conditions proved to\nbe more 'of a problem for Cambridge than\nImperial, and in the fu st race against the\nvisitors Imperial soon had a commanding 1 st,\n2nd and 3rd. In the second race Bevan\ndecided to full his boat up before the start and\n'submarine' around the course\u2014a tactic\ndescribed in detail in a book to be published\nlater this year. Unfortunately after an\nexcellent start he hd to retire with his vessel\nand crew complaining loudly at his antics.\nNevertheless the remainder of the Imperial\nteam sailed home with room to spare and\neasily took the match.\nThe more important match of the day was\nagainst ULII. Facing a very strong team,\nImperial sceptically took to their boats and\nset off for the start. ULII casually played\naround the starting area waiting to engage the\nopposition. The stage was set to find the stuff\nof which sailors are made.\nImperial's pre-start tactics caught ULII by\nsurprise. By sacrificing their skipper 'Chuck'\nJones, they diverted the opposition's attention and slipped through the start line in a Page 12W kW LW kW kW kW kW kW kW Uk W mW commanding position. Some hard sailing\nmaintained their lead for the rest of the race\nand Imperial finished with a winning 1, 2, 6\ncombination.\nUnfortunately a discrepancy over the rules\nforced are sail. Imperial's confidence was\ngrowing, however, and they were determined\nnot to let victory slip from their grasp. Jones\nagain sacrificed himself at the start and the\nother two Imperial boats again made\nexcellent starts. ULII would not accept\ndefeat, however, and fought back resolutely.\nImperial finally took command and took the\nmatch with a1,3,6 combination at the finish.\nMany thanks to ULII for providing some\nvery exciting sailing\u2014and the lunch as well!\nUri Gagarin\nFootball\nICIXI 4 K CHI XI1A game which IC had to win to remain a premier division side next season, saw the\nteam produce their best performance of the\nseason, due mainly to the influence of Big\nJon.

But with Dutch import Jon\nVan Der Barden impressive as ever, Neal\nVandenbegin hit a scorching volley to make it\n3-1 at the interval.\n(A) roused by a Joan Hardon(?) half time\nteam talk IC continued to take the game to\nK CH.

    "content": "OF\nCHEAPSKATE By\nJuvenal\nIt was shortly after dawn, on a cold,\nwindy morning in Cheapskate. A few\ncitizens were making their dreary, daily\ntrudge up Baronsgate. And as the\ncleaners cleaned away the tattered\nposters which were strewn all over the\nkingdom, John Secretary sat in\nhis office, deep within the bowels of the Surefield building. Upon his desk lay a thick document, bound in\nleather. It was the latest of his cunning\nschemes, designed to bring absolute\ncontrol of the citizens hovels to him\nalone. 'Within months, the rents will be\nso high that all the citizens will have left.\nThen I can fill them with stupid American tourists,' he mused. 'All I need is a weak\nPresident '\nMuch later that day, secure in the\nanonymity of a dark, romantic corner in\nSouthside tavern sat the subject of John Secretary's machinations: Gormless\nLayon. And at her side, as ever, was\n'next year's president' Ian Balls. Gorm less gazed longingly into his eyes, pouted\nher lips and whispered, suggestively,\ninto his ear: ' Ooh, you're so able and experienced, Ian. It's enough to sweep a simple girl like me off her feet.'\nAlways most amenable to flattery,\nBalls nodded sage ly and took a further\nsip of his mead. For he had achieved the\nultimate confidence trick: he believed his\nown publicity!\nAlready his thoughts were moving to\nmore ambitious projects.\n'The problem is that a year is such\nshort time,' he moaned to the ever\nattentive Gormless. 'What is needed is\ncontinuity \u2014 years, decades of uninterrupted rule.' Turning to face Gormless, Balls prepared to reveal his\nwildest dreams. Mustering the most\nstatesman-like voice that his grating\nnorthern tones could muster, he declared ' You and I Gormless\u2014together we can form a dynasty to last a thousand years. No more sordid elections, no evil F ALIX Editors to cope\nwith. A life of perpetual luxury\u2014sherry,\npate and unfettered power. For just the\ntwo of us, Gormless.'\n' Oh, and Pristine,' replied Gormless,\nwisely realising that someone would\nhave to do the work. But Gorm less' response fell on deaf ears for Balls was\nlost in a flight of fantasy, his imagination\nalready had him, wreathed in laurels\nsitting majestically in front of chanting\ncitizens.\nHowever, Balls flight of fantasy came\nto a sudden end. For a tall shadow fell\nupon both Balls and Gormless. Their\nhearts filled with fear and trepidation as a tall man, donned in a long black coat and\ncarrying an old canvas bag at his side,\napproached. And their worst fears were\nrealised\u2014'Ere, will you sign this petition\nI 've got Gormless?'\nYes, it was Peter Burp the citizen's representative whose job it was to plead\nwith the Baron's seniors for a few more\ngroat s. Noone was safe from the\nclipboard and pen. As Balls turned away\nGormless resisted the easy way out ' Oh can'tI sign it later Peter? I was having a break from my affairs of state.'\nThe astute Peter Burp noted the\ngrandeur of Gorm less' reply and guessed that Balls' influence had begun\nto show. Shrewd as ever, Burp pressed\nhome his request in a way sure to get'\nresults.\n' Oh, please sign now Gormless\u2014Pristine has!' Gormless hurriedly placed an\n' X' ot the bottom of the page and a now\nsmiling Burp shuffled off on his way.\nGormless and Balls were left in their\nromantic solitude.\nWhat do Gormless and Ian get\nup to in their romantic solitude?-Find out in the next exciting\ninstalment of The Baron of Cheapskate.\nPage 10\nBEHIND\nCLOSED DOORS\nMr J FD Lauwerys, Senior Assistant\nSecretary\nSome people who are featured in this\ncolumn are relatively uri Known to the\nvast majority of students at Imperial\nCollege yet are important within the\nCollege. However, John Lauwerys has\nbeen in the public eye for some time yet\nis a minor cog (infact rather a rusty cog)\nin the IC machine. He has a profile\nwithout substance as the report he\nprepared rather cruelly pointed out.\nOne could almost say that his report was\nthat of an auto mit on manipulated from\nelsewhere on level 5. Few people who quote the report have taken the trouble\nto read it and to discover that it is\nunimaginative and badly argued. It gains\na credibility by quotation that it does not\ndeserve.\nIt is pert in ant to remember that the\npoints at issue now are those devised by\nJohn Smith justified by the invocation of\nreport. A report that was poorly\nprepared and published several months\nlate was less widely discussed than it\nshould have been. It generated an acrimony that has obscured the very\nreal and important problems that face\nthe College.\nSince the report John Lauwerys has\nbeen attached to the estates section. It is\ndifficult to decide who is being rewarded\nor punished by such a move. It is difficult\nnot to have some sympathy for the man\nnow that his life is pure tedium\ninterrupted only by anticlimax. It is\nreminiscent of the life led by the ex-Kings\nand royal pretenders who clutter up the\nSherfield building in some hope of the\nreturn to the life of grandeur led by their\nancestors yet and of grandeur led by\ntheir ancestors yet are des in ted to be\ntrumped by filing clerks for the rest of\ntheir lives.\nIn a previous article Don Clark and\nHector Cameron Clark were termed\n'Laurel and Hardy'. Perhaps with the\naddition of John Lauwery we are\nwitnessing the debut of 'the Three\nStooges'.\nFriday, March 9, 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "THE GAS PEOPLE\nUORKING FOR TOMORROWS\nUORLD TODAV\nIf your home uses gas \u2014 and the chances are it\nwill, since British Gas is the largest single supplier\nof heat in Britain \u2014 then you are benefiting from\nyesterday's planning and investment in advanced\ntechnology by the gas people.\nYesterday's research anticipated the needs of\ntoday's customers, and some of the developments\nproduced by the gas people were revolutionary.\nDid you know, for instance, that the gas people\nhelped to pioneer the technology for transporting\ngas across the world's oceans \u2014 gas which would\notherwise be wastefully flared-off? This was done\nby cooling the gas into liquid form at minus 160\u00b0C and carrying it in specially designed tankers. The\ntransportation of LNG is now a major world trade.\nThe gas people also saw opportunities in newly\navailable gas-making feedstocks and developed the\nCatalytic Rich Gas process for making gas from oil,\nrather than coal. Advances like these underpinned\nthe transformation of an ageing industry into a highly competitive and rapidly expanding modern\nbusiness.\nThe gas people went on to exploit the natural gas\nwhich they had helped to discover around our\nshores. To achieve this they constructed a network of\nunderground high pressure steel pipelines to the\nhighest standards. A great deal of money and technical expertise were expended in devising a means of\ninspecting these pipelines, and a sophisticated\nelectronic and mechanical device called an\n'intelligent pig' was developed. It works inside the\npipeline while the gas is still flowing.\nTOMORROW'S WORLD\nYesterday, the gas people solved what would\nhave been today's problems, and we've given you\njust a few examples. But you may be more interested\nin the work we're doing today to solve tomorrow's. For instance, in readiness for the time when\nBritain's indigenous supplies of natural gas begin to\ndecline, and nobody knows when that will be, the gas\npeople have already developed the technology for\nproducing substitute natural gas from coal. The\nresults of this pioneering work are being viewed with\ngreat interest in many parts of the world. Whichever\nfeedstock is available at a competitive price, however,\nthe gas people intend to have the technology to\nproduce a substitute natural gas from it.\nAnd because gas will still be there for\ntomorrow's customers, the gas people are helping to\ndevelop a new generation of appliances for to-morrow's low-energy homes. They are starting to\napply ways of recuperating waste heat in industrial\nand commercial applications by using gas engine-driven heat pumps. These reverse the normal\nprocess by which heat flows from a high temperature\nto a lower and so can consume less energy than they\ndeliver! The gas people are even looking at new ways\nto avoid traffic congestion \u2014 by replacing\nunderground gas pipes without the need for digging\nup the road!\nMuch more is going on besides, so if you'd like to\nfind out about today's high-tech gas industry, write\nto the Public Relations Department, British Gas,\nRivermill House, 152 Grosvenor Road, London\nSW1V 3J L.

    "content": "Feature\nCuts: The Crisis Continues\nIC Under Attack\nImperial College has recently\nbeen informed by the University\nGrants Committee (UGC) of its\nrecurrent grant for the 1984/5\nsession.\nThe College is to receive\n\u00a3 2 8 . 0 6 m from the UGC, compared with \u00a327.29m for this\nyear. However, in real terms this\nrepresents a cut of 2'/2 %\n(assuming Retail Price inflation\nof 5.5%), despite Government\npromises of level funding over\nthis period.\nWhat will this mean for students?\nIn the words of one department's Director of Undergraduate\nStudies, 'if we have a cut of 2'/2 %,\nthe effect on the teaching budget\nwill be 10%, as the salaries bill for\nthe College must firstly be paid.\nThis will affect the quality of\ncourses.' Departments will be\nunable to take any initiative in\nmodernizing courses. There is no\nmoney to spend on new\nequipment; students will be\nunfamiliar with new techniques\nand applications. All other things\nbeing equal, IC students will be\nless attractive to an employer\nthan you would have been had\nyou graduated three years earlier, j Since departments are having\nto fight for money for academic\npurposes, there will certainly be\nnothing to spend on sub sidi sing College services such as\nrefectories, and, as we have\nrecently seen, residences. This\nwill lead to even more price\nincreases with the effect of\nsqueezing your grant still further.\n\u2022 Libraries and Welfare Services,\nboth important to students, are\nalso 'soft targets' for College to\nconstrict when saving money.\n' Things look bad for students.\nThe prospects are even worse for\nothers when we consider the\neffect of jobs losses.\nThe Government Looks to the\nFuture\nThe recently published Public\nExpenditure White Paper gives a few hints as to how the Education\nsector can expect to fare over the\nnext couple of years. Education\nas a whole will receive a cut in\nprovision unless inflation and\nwage increases are held at levels\ngenerally considered to be\noptimistically low. The Universities are told that 'the\ncash available will require a measure of increased economy if\nstandards are to be maintained'.\nThis is because a half per cent\n'efficiency cut' is to be made in\ntheir funding.\nPage 4 ^BMUUMMMMUWSSBGBk\nSir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer,\nchairman of the UGC, has\nconfirmed that the Universities\ncan expect 'nibbling away' of\ntheir resources over the next few\nyears.\nEfficiency cuts sound laudable\nin principle, but in practise many\nfeel that efficiency within the\nUniversities will not be improved\nby the under staffing which\nusually results from such cuts. At\na time when demand for higher\neducation is rising and inflation\nand wages are beginning to creep\nup, it seems that inefficiency is\nnot all that will be cut.\nColleges Looks to the Future\nImperial College has by now\ndrafted a document, yet to be\nultimately approved by the\nGoverning Body, in response to\nthe UGC' s'28 questions'\nconsultation. The report explains\nhow the College intends to adopt\nto the changing forces in Higher\nEducation into the 1990s, and is\nclearly of major importance in\nsubsequent planning.\nThe response paints a grim\npicture for the future even if level\nfunding is granted. It states that\n'if the present depressed level is\nmaintained for both recurrent\nand equipment funding, new\ninitiatives in teaching and\nresearch will be very severely\nrestricted, the quality of both will\nsuffer, and opportunities to do\nresearch which would be valuable\nto the community will be turned\ndown, because the College will\nnot be able to provide the\nnecessary facilities.' We are also\ntold that 'no major expansion of\nactivity would be possible, and\nthe resources for even small\ninitiatives would have to be\nfound by contracting other\nactivities'.\nThe consequences of further\ncuts would be disastrous,\nrequiring abandonment of all\nacademic initiatives, reductions\nIMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\nUNION\nDear\nAs a student at Imperial College, London, I note with\ngreat disappointment the recent Department of Education\nand Science (DES) proposals concerning Student Awards\nfor the 1984/5 session.\nThe DES plan an increase in the student once again face\na cut in their real income. Increases in the parental\ncontribution and halving of the minimum grant means that\nstudents will be even more dependent upon the goodwill of\ntheir parents. Plans to reform the present system of travel\npayments will undoubtedly place students who live some\ndistance from their college at a severe disadvantage if\nimplemented.\nThe wider issue of cutbacks to Higher Education as a whole is of major concern to me. Local Authority Higher\nEducation is facing drastic pruning this year and the\nUniverrsities have been asked how they would react to a further drop in their resources. Imperial College itself, an\ninternationally respected college of science and technology,\nfaces a2y2% cut in funding over the next academic year in\nreal terms. Whilst I am aware that the government is\ncommitted to reducing public expenditure, I would point\nout the importance of skilled graduates as an investment\ntowards the long term well be in of the country.\nI would be very grateful if you would reply to me outlining\nyour op ii is on these matters. If you share the concern of\nstudents I should be grateful if you would raise the issue as\na Parliamentary question, or directly with Mr Peter Brooke,\nUnder-Secretary of State at the DES and by calling for a full\nParliamentary debate on the education cuts in general.\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\nYours sincerely\ni Write a letter like this to your MP (you can find out who he is in\n1\nthe Union Of,f ice). Remember,.He's yo o.r MP\"^ \u2022 \u2022 HH^ H^I Friday, March 9, 1984 WUUUUUWUWUWk\nin academic staff and, in extreme\ncases would leave some\ndepartments unmanageable and\nsome buildings unsafe. The\nreport comments that 'it is a matter of considerable regret that\nthe 'great debate' is being\nconducted under the shadow of a suggestion of less than the level\nfunding which the universities\nhad been led to expect from 1984-5 following the period of\ncontraction. The damage to the\nuniversities caused by the general\ntrend of government policy could\nbe incalculable'.\nOn the whole, the draft report\nmakes a series of constructive\ncomments on a range of issues.\nHowever, it takes a disappointing\nstance on the question of\nexpanding student access to the\ncollege. Imperial College would\nnot be prepared to take on bright\nindividuals who do not,\nunfortunately, have the necessary\nformal qualifications. Due to the\nadvanced nature of courses\noffered at IC, A Levels are felt to\nbe necessary if students are to\ncope with their studies. However,\nthe College is dismissive of\n'conversion' courses, which\ncould allow suitable unqualified\nstudents to reach the necessary\nlevel of understanding for entry\nto degree courses. This is,\nperhaps, surprising in view of\npress reports following rioting\nsuch areas as Brixton and\nToxteth which suggested that\nImperial College would be\nprepared to take on just such\nunderprivileged youngsters. The\nCollege does, however, call for an\nincrease in the overall participation rate in Higher\nEducation, and this is to be\nwelcomed.\nThe College could also be\naccused of taking an unduly self-interested view in calling for a shift of students towards science\nand engineering courses. College\nknows full well that the\nGovernment is likely to use any\nexcuse to further attack the\nteaching of Arts and Humanities,\nthus restricting student choice of\ncourses in what is, after all,\nsupposed to be a free country.\nThe response fails to point out\nthat degrees in scientific and\nengineering subjects cost\napproximately twice as much as\ndegrees in Arts subjects.\nThe College feels that no useful\npurpose would be served in\nreducing degree lengths to two\nyears or by lengthening the\nacademic year to accommodate\nthis. It also favours an increase in\nFELIX\n\n"

    "content": "f SP1 OF COLLEGE U Cruise On!\nThe results of the Sabbatical Elections were oficial ly announced at the\nResults UGM yesterday. The full results appear on page 3. Also at the\nmeeting elections for non-sabbatical Union Officers were held\nfollowing which no less than five motions were passed. Union President\nGaynor Lewis was mandated to write to Ronald Reagan to request that\na cruise missile be named 'Imperial College Union'.\nThe election results were as\nreported in the special FELIX news sheet on Wednesday. Ian\nBull, Dave Parry, Eric Darbyshire and Dave Rowe were\nelected President, DP, Hon Sec\nand FELIX Editor respectively.\nOf the elections held at\nyesterday'sU GM only that for\nExternal Affairs Officer was\ncontested, with Jo Claybrain\n(Shome m ish take shu rely Ed)\nbeating Michael Newman for the\npost. Other Officers for next\nyear will be Graham Thorpe\n( Academic Affairs), James\nBenbow (Rag Chairman), Dave\nAllen (Ents Officer), J Martin\nTaylor (Internal Services) and\nMike Stuart (Welfare). The post\nof Community Action Group\nChairman remains vacant. Sean\nDavis was elected unopposed as\nU GM Chairman.\nThe meeting then moved on to\nmotions. A motion proposed by\nSimon Neild that observers be\nsent to the next NUS conference\nwas passed. Papers for two\nobservers, to be elected by\nCouncil, will go up on Monday.\nNext on the agenda was a motion on Grenada and the\nLebanon but the meeting voted\nnot to hear this. Then the\nmotion on Cruise missiles was\nheard. The motion called for\nprotest by the Union about\nCruise being stationed in Britain, but an amendment\nproposed by Tim Williams, R SMU VP, which instructed the\nUnion President to write to\nRonald Reagan asking for a missile to be named after ICU was carried overwhelmingly, as\nwas the amended motion.\nTwo serious motions, one\nopposing the abolition of the\nILEA and the other calling for\ncollections to be held for the\nWorld University Service scholarship fund, were then\npassed with little opposition.\nMichael Newman's motion on\nPimps was then considered but\nreceived no votes at all. Finally\nan emergency motion that all\npresent be bought a pint in the\nQueen's Arms by the present\nsabbaticals was passed with only\nthree votes against.\nPROF SLAMS ICU\nThe consequences of further cut ba cls in Government funding would be\ndisaster o us for Imperial College, according to the Pro-Rector.\nSpeaking at an open meeting called to discuss the College's response to\nthe recent University Grants Committee question aire on the future of\nhigher education, Professor Alan Swanson said that the result j of assumptions required by the questions would be that the College would\nhave to close 'a medium-sized department'. He severely criticised the\nUnion for its poor and unconstructive reply to the question aire, twice\nstating that there had been 'very little response' from the Union despite\nhis invitation to all interested bodies in College to contribute.\nThe meeting was called so that running through the College's EAO Peter Burt and Pro-Rector Professor Swanson\nNo 670 WmmWMMWKBWWBUWUWMKWmWMWMM\nthe Pro-Rector, who is coordinating IC's response, could\nexplain its main points to\ninterested members of College.\nThe UGC has asked 28 quest-ions, to all of which College is\nreplying. The first three questions are, however, the most\nfundamental.\nQuestion number one asks for\nthe College's plans if over the\nnext five years there is constant\nfunding with student numbers\nremaining static. The second\nquestion supposes a cut in\nresources with constant student\nnumbers, and the third asks for\nplans for the subsequent five\nyears (1990-95) if student\nnumbers decline by about 15^>\nas suggested by demographic\ntrends.\nThe College would face\ndifficulties even in the first of\nthese scenarios, said Professor\nSwanson. Already maintenance\nof buildings has been cut back to\nextremely low levels and this\ncould soon result in serious\nproblems. Staff cuts by early\nretirement have left many\ndepartments with no scheduled\nretirements for up to four years.\nThe situation if there were to be\nfurther cuts following those over\nthe last five years would be such\nthat the College would have to\nclose a 'medium-sized depart-ment' according to Professor\nSwanson. He hoped sanity\nwould prevail and that the\nGovernment would not seek to\nimpose such damage on Imperial\nCollege.\nOne of the main themes\nresponse is the need to give\npriority to technological subjects\nat the expense, if necessary, of\nless vocational subjects. Whilst\nthe College believes there should\nbe academic activity concerned\nwith 'everything which human\nbeings have thought about',\nuseful or not, it is concerned\nwith producing trained scientists\nand engineers upon whom the\nnation's economic health dep-ends.\nIn rep y ling to a question\nfrom a student in the audience\nwho asked if the College would\ninclude in its response the view\nthat students would be disc our aged from going to\nUniversity if the value of the\nstudent grant was further\nreduced. Professor Swanson said\nhe felt that it was up to the\nUnion to push forward such\ncontributions. The Union has, in\nhis opinion, failed to respond\nadequately to the questionnaire,\ngiving excuses about being busy\nwith other matters.\nIt was reported in FELIX\nissue 663 that the Union's response to the questionnaire\nwould not be taken seriously by\nCollege because it was badly\nwritten and wish y was hy. It\nseems that this assessment of the\nUnion response is shared by the\nPro-Rector. Union President\nGaynor Lewis, one of the\nauthors of the Union response,\nwas reported after the meeting\nto be 'hopping mad' about the\nPro-Rector's comments.\nSee feature, page 4, and\neditorial comment\nFELIX, March 9 1984 Free!\n\n"

    "content": "CCUs Make Waves\nThe RCS and Guilds College fought a close battle in the\nSwimming Gala last Thursday with Guilds just getting the\nedge in the relay events. The final result was Guilds 136\npoints, RCS 109 and Mines 67. Mines Union, however,\ncompletely dominated the water-polo event, easily beating\nboth the other CCUs.\nRag Week Flop\nLast Wednesday, Paul Cronk, a Sabbatical Officer of University\nCollege Union, was kidnapped\nby members of the Royal College of Science as a stunt for\nthe mini Rag Week. After\nseveral hours of negotiation,\nduring which they convinced\nUCL Union that LSE had kidnapped him as part of the\nhunt for Bruce the Beaver, he\nwas released in exchange for a case of Fosters and \u00a35.\nThis stunt was the only high\nspot in an otherwise disappointing Rag Week. Tuesday's Silly Sports event was not\nsuccessful, raising only \u00a310, and\nthe Hypnosis Lecture scheduled\nfor Tuesday evening had to be\npostponed owing to the hypnotist, MartinS Taylor, falling ill. It is hoped that the\nstreet collections held tonight\nand tomorrow morning will be\nmore of a success. The Royal\nCollege of Science will be\ncollecting outside Harrods at\n5.30pm today and will be leapfrogging down Kensington High\nStreet to mmo row morning.

UGM Sketch\nICU had a brainstorm at\nyesterday's Union General\nMeeting and passed several\n'trendy left-wing' motions with a minimum of fuss after refusing to\nhear them for months. However,\ndespite all these near-miracles the\nmeeting stopped just short of\nvoting for the second coming -Michael Newman will not be next\nyear's External Affairs Officer.\nMichael was not present for the\nstart of the election but briefly\nflustered in during Jo Claydon's, his opponent's speech. Miss\nClaydon's speech was 'un event ful' and even prompted J. Martin\nTaylor, FELIX News Editor and\nFELIX H nHM H widely believed to be the most\nboring speaker in the history of\nthis college, to utter T was never\nas boring as that'.\nTotal lu nancy then prevailed -usually revolving round Mines\nVP Tim Williams who made\nseveral speeches - usually totally\nirrelevant - and always carrying a package the size of a video tape,\nprobably something pornographic about animals and\ncoloured people down South\nAfrican Mines. Mr Williams'\nmajor success however was in\ncommending a motion, subsequently passed, that\nGaynor Lewis should write to\nRonald Reagan ordering him to\nname one cruise missile Imperial\nCollege Union.\nMHHLMHHHI News\nAussies Move in\nA new travel agency is to begin\ntrading at IC at the beginning of\nnext term.

The\nbuilding plans are at present\nawaiting approval by Estates\nexpert, Mr Hector Cameron\nClark.\nThe contract with ST A is still\nunder consideration, but it seems\nthat it will be of considerable\nbenefit to IC Union.

    "content": "The Curzon Street Cinema puts on high-quality art films\u2014Hear and Dust and\nBetrayal are typical of this. Carmen is the\nlatest offering, but it's not in the same class as\nthe earlier two films. Carlos Saura, the\nSpanish director, is fascinated by the\ninterchange ability of art and life. Carmen is a behind-the-screens look at the rehearsals of\nBizet's opera. The lives of the dancers begin\nto follow the same story as that of the opera,\nuntil you cannot tell which is real life and\nwhich is make-believe. This central idea is\nwell put over, but the characters of those\ninvolved are insufficiently developed\u2014they\nare paste-board figures who Saura slots into\nhis theme, mere marionettes who dance in\nsubservience to the director's ego.\nHaving said that, the film is a visual treat.\nThe flamenco dancing has a rhythmic\nintensity and vitality that assaults the senses,\nuntil you become full of the thud of feet and\nthe clacking of castanets. Even though the\nplot is thin and labour ed, Carmen is a lesson\nin just how effective a medium film can be.\nRisky Business (Warner West End) is a superior remake of Dustin Hoffman's The\nGraduate. Joel (Tom Currie) is 18, and the\nAmerican version of the 'average' middle-class A Level pupil in Britain. As we aimed for\nImperial or Cambridge, so Joel is aiming for a Top Class (Ivy League) university. But unlike\nThe Graduate, when everyone laughed at\nthe man who said 'plastics', Joel's future is\nuncertain\u2014the pressures of academic life\nand of becoming successful are far greater,\nuntil they totally dominate Joel's life. The\nanxieties of College work are preventing him\nfrom any rational contemplation about the\ndirection he is taking in his life. Events and\nexams swamp him. Until his parents go away\nand leave him alone for a week, and he\ndecides to get some 'experience'.\nRisky Business is funnier than Trading\nPlaces. The auditorium regularly rocked with\nlaughter, because Tom Cruise puts in a great\nperformance as the gauche student who gets\nto learn about wine, women and fast cars. He\nends up organising a brothel for all his friends\n\u2022\n, \u2022 y' Sexy Lana Scharf prepares to\nfurther Joel's education in 'Risky\nBusiness'\nPage 8 j^ HH BH HH HH in his own suburban home, into which walks\nthe Princeton man who wants to give Joel his\nversion of an UCC A interview. As a film that\nis both funny and relevant to students, Risky\nBusiness will make an excellent night out.\nVertigo (Plaza 2) is the second in the series\nof vintage Hitchcock releases begun by 'Rear\nWindow'.\nThe story is about a detective (James\nStewart) who becomes an innocent accomplice in a complicated murder plan,\ndue to his fear of heights. Madeline Elster\n(Kim Novak) appears to be possessed by the\nspirit of her great-grandmother, Carlotta\nValdes, who committed suicide exactly one\nhundred years previously in 1857. The\ndetective is asked to tail her and look after\nher. But he also falls in love with her and is\nconsumed with guilt when she finally\nmanages (apparently) to kill herself. He\nsuffers a nervous breakdown, and, possessed himself now, starts to see the face\nof Madeline in every woman he meets. Then\none day he meets her living image in the\nstreet, and the whole story starts to unravel...\nHitchcock's skill lay in his ability to fit\ncomplex psychological themes into\nsuperficially simple situations. 'Vertigo' is no\nexception. The scenes where Madeline takes\non the character of Carlotta are genuinely\ncreepy: one scene in a graveyard has a dreamlike atmosphere; everything is etched\nand motionless, with a ghostly figure standing\narrested by a gravestone. The nature of\nidentity is the most important theme. Is the\nwoman Stewart follows really Madeline?\nSome people will dislike this film because\non the surface it appears dated and naive\ncompared to glossy modern films. But if you\nstudy the undercurrents and concentrate on\nthe 'big' scenes, 'Vertigo' is both disturbing\nand rewarding.\nFILMS FOR EASTER\nHe had the stuff heroes were made of THE RIGHT STUFF The Right Stuff (Warner West End)\nwas launched perfectly on time for Senator\nJohn Glenn's first test-flight for the Democratic Presidential Nomination at the Iowa\ncauca uses. Glenn got a meagre 3.5% of the\nvote and the thumbs down, but for me the\nfilm is a success.\nThe story is about the Mercury space\nprogramme, the first astronauts and the test-pilots who pre cee ded them. You might think\nthat this is a mere nostalgic documentary.\nWhat in fact emerges is a marvellous picture\nof the sharp end of 'technological America'.\nThis film is highly relevant to Imperial\nstudents, with historical interest and a study\nof what it is in technology and its products\nthat fascinates men and motivates our society\nThe Right Society's canvas is immense,\nranging from the breaking of the sound\nbarrier in 1947 to the last solo US spaceflight\nin 1963, from the bleak and self-centred test-pilots boozer in the Californian desert to the\nraz zama tazz of ticker-tape parades in New\nYork. The progress of the early space age is\nfollowed meticulously^the fast jets, Sputnik,\nGagarin. We see behind the scenes at the\nWhite House, the programme of (often very\nfunny) rigorous tests to choose the seven\nMercury astronauts and the immense\npublicity that surrounded them. And throughout it all there is the space hardware\nitself. The photography of the jets and their\nawesome power is truly stunning\u2014your ears\nstart to ring with the roar of after-burners and\nthe thud of the sonic boom.\nThe most interesting character is Yaeger,\nplayed by Sam Shepard. Yaeger was the first\nman to break the sound barrier and is at the\ntop of the test-pilot's 'pyramid' of success. He\nepi to mises 'the right stuff, the inner-directed\ndrive to break barriers, the drive of the\nclimber who assaults a mountain 'because it's there'. Yet he is also a loner, and unsuitable\nfor the media figures required by NASA to\nhelp fund the Mercury programme. He opts\nout of becoming an astronaut, only to find\nthat test-pilots lose the glamour and the\nfunding to the space race. He retains his\nintegrity but loses the esteem of others. His\ndilemma is made more poignant by his\ncharacter, which so rarely expresses emo-tion. His only reply is to try and break one last\nrecord and fly up, up in a wonderful new\nplane, higher than anyone else, to the edge of\nspace where he can see the stars, the realm\nof his rivals the astronauts. Only a plane\ncannot fly in space....Shades of Icarus.\nThefuture Mercury astronauts going through intensive physical tests before being\nchosen for the American Space Program\nI Friday, March 9, 19841\nMel Brooks has shown an unhealthy\nfascination with Nazism in several of his films,\nso it's no surprise that the subject features\nprominently in his latest To Be Or Not To\nBe (on just about everywhere). This is a remake of a1942 classic comedy, but this\nversion is no classic.\nThe first half isn't all that funny, with most\nof the jokes either being telegraphed or old-hat; Brooks seems to believe his own\npublicity and thinks that he only has to start\ntalking in his throaty Brooklyn whisper to\nhave the audience rolling in the aisles.\nThe plot revolves around a Polish couple\nFrederick and Anna Bronski (played by\nBrooks and his wife Anne Bancroft) who run\na theatre in Warsaw just before Hitler\ninvades Poland. Bronski is an actor of limited\ntalent. During his regular To Be or Not To Be\nsoliloquies from Hamlet his wife is visited\nbackstage by her young lover. Hitler's invasion ends all this and the humour takes\noff when Bronski tries to keep his theatre\nrunning during various twists and turns of the\nplot.\nThe second half is much better by virtue of\ntougher direction, the inclusion of scenes\noutside the theatre and some excellent\nperformances by supporting actors to\ncomplement the cherubic Brooks and his\noften very funny impersonations.\nThe degree to which you find this film\nfunny will depend on whether you consider\nNazism, religious persecution and mass\nmurder fit subjects to be used as a source of\ncomedy. Although the humour is always at\nthe expense of Nazis, neither the direction or\nthe acting gave any impression that what the\nfilm dealt with was actually once very\ndangerous.\nCompared to other recent comedies To\nBe Or Not To Be is as funny as The Meaning\nof Life but it pales in comparison with Eddie\nMurphy in Trading Places or 48Hrs. Peter Rodgers\nIt is sixteen years since 1968 and\nLawrence Kasdan (director of 'Body-heat') has decided to try and analyse the\nSixties' generation, who are now in their mid-thirties and feeling The Big Chill (Classic\nOxford Street et al). Seven people who\nwere friends at university meet again for the\nfuneral of the eighth member of their group.\nHe was their old leader, a brilliant physicist\nwho became a drop-out and ended up\nslashing his wrists. The seven friends spend a weekend together, trying to reconstruct\nsomething of the old life and asking 'What\nwent wrong?'\nEvery generation comes to ask this\nquestion, but for the students of the late\nSixties it is all the more poignant considering\nhow great their hopes were, and how great\ntheir naivety.\nTheir problems largely consist of a certain\nemotional sterility. Each member of the\ngroup has become wrapped up in their own\nday-to-day life. Their reunion provides an\nopportunity for each of them to reassess\ntheir character and direction. Some change,\nsome remain the same, but the overall\natmosphere is a study in the renewal of\nfriendships and of self-awareness.\nThis all sounds really corny, but in fact The\nBig Chill is great fun. The cast includes some\nof the best young American actors around at\nthe moment (William Hurt, and Kevin Kline\nof Sophie's Choice, for example). The\ndialogue is witty and entertaining, in a style\nreminiscent of MASH. The Big Chill is no\ndevastating expose of our times, thank\ngoodness. It is an entertaining, evocative and\noccasionally sad country-house movie.\nMr Samson, a tough Cabbie with a heart of gold.\nStreet Fleet (Plaza, Piccadilly Circus)\nis essentially a screen version of the TV series\nTaxi. The 'plot' concerns a crummy taxi firm\nwith a collection of lunatic drivers. By a series\nof improbable incidents the young hero, tres h to Washington DC from the Deep South,\nsaves the lunatics from themselves, saves the\nfirm from collapse and provides an inspiration to us all. The soap froths and bu boi es violently at times, but what saves Street Fleet\nfrom total condemnation is the sheer\nexuberance of the characters and the\nsometimes very funny situations they get ;n to The taxis make the average student car look\nlike a RoHs-Royce in comparison. If you can\nstand soap opera on the big screen ana i ike lunatic car chases, this film is just about\nworth spending your money on.\nAlmonds and Raisins (Phoenix, East\nFinchley) is an affectionate and humorous\ndocumentary about the Yiddish-speaKing\nmovie industry that enjoyed a brief flowering\nin America during the Thirties. Many oi the\nfirst generation Jews who emigrated from\nEurope could not speak English.
