    "content": "By B.B. Wolffe\nIf you remember one of my earlier stories\nentitled 'Barclays Riddle' in FELIX 566 (you\nknow, the issue with those abominable\ncartoons), then you'll appreciate a similar\nincident which occured closer to home.\nFELIX received a full page graduate\nrecruitment advertisement for Borroughs (an\nengineering firm) from advertising agency\nAustin Knight, which proclaimed an exhibition\nin Southampton! Keen eyes spotted the flaw\nand a hasty phone call secured the correct\nvenue in London.\nHot on the trail of a FELIX scoop, we\nquickly dispatched a reporter off to\nSouthampton to peruse the University\nnewspaper, Wessex News (and the local beer\nfestival). I must admit, we found it very difficult\nto stifle the laughter on seeing the same\nBurroughs ad inviting all keen undergraduates to an exhibition at the London\nInternational Hotel, Cromwell Road, London!\nPerhaps this says something about an IC\ngraduate's eye for fine detail so eagerly sought\nafter by engineering firms. Tough luck,\nSouthampton!\nMost of you will have seen those jolly little\nposters which are affixed to illegally parked\ncars around College. As a deter rant, said\nposters are usually stuck down with an\nextremely good adhesive and cause much\nconsternation. And quite rightly, Sir, might I add.\nRecently, a few car-owners broke out into a cold sweat upon espying from a distance what\nappeared to be one of these dreaded curses.\nHowever, most were rather shocked to find\nthe offending piece of paper peel off eai ly in\ntheir hands. Many felt they had simply been\nlucky and had arrived while the glue was still\nsetting. The most observant few actually read\nthe poster!\nTHIS CAR IS PARKED LEGALLY.\nYOUR VEHICLE'S REGISTRATION NUMBER\nHAS BEEN NOTED AND SHOULD YOU\nPERSIST IN LEGALLY PARKING YOUR\nVEHICLE IN THIS WAY YOU WILL NOT\nBE LIABLE TO FURTHER ACTION WHICH\nWON'T INVOLVE A FINE OF \u00a30 FOR EVERY\nTIME YOU CONTRAVENE THIS ORDER.\nBy order of I.C. Onion.\nThe Editor was sent a strange present this\nweek which he has passed on to me. It was a plastic bag left in the of ice containing the\nSherfield security sign and the security guard's page phone b leeper signing out book, together\nwith the following letter:\nDear Steve, I thought this might appeal to you:\nAfter repeated failed attempts to find anyone\nfrom security in the remote vicinity of the\ntwenty-four hour security desk in Sherfield, in\nthe small hours of the morning this weekend,\na member of this college decided to collect a memento of College security vigilance. I apologise for any inconvenience caused to the\nnoble defenders of the bank, service-till and all\nthe offices in the building, but it nicely balances\nan hour spent carrying equipment up and\ndown stairs because there was no one around\nto unlock a door (why bother locking a side-door when a thief could go in and help himself\nto the entire contents of the security desk?).\nI regret I must remain anonymous, but those\nsleeping behind the desk are already so\nunhelpful after having been woken up that 1 do\nnot think it would be useful if I were identified\nwith any particular group who might wish to\nuse their dubious services again. Yours, etc.\nPS: Rumour has it i.e. security said so, that\ndarling Rae has run off with the key to the\ncleaners cupboard in Sherfield, just to help any\nother poor minions around here who might\nwant to use the stuff to clean up after parties.\nIs it any wonder the place is in a mess on\nMonday mornings?\nEnclosed: one sign and one security checklist book from the desk in Sherfield.\nIsn't it terrible the things some chaps get up\nto! Mr Marshall has given the momentos to\nBeit Security to return to Sherfield.\nAny other equally amusing presents will be\nreadily accepted. In fact, we might just give a prize for the most amusing one at the end of\nthe year.\ntwilight Mi\nWhat a glorious place Imperial College is! One\nhas only to browse through a copy of this\nyear's pristine prospectus to reveal all the joys\nand pleasures of life at IC. Take for instance\nthe two photos shown here depicting two sides\nof life in a study bedroom. Picture one shows\nthe diligent student, obviously overflowing with\nfresher enthusiasm, scrawling away at desk,\ndesk packed with useful material (Kleenex,\nrubber plant, bananas, etc), surrounded by\neducational wall-hangings (picture postcards\nof Brighton, etc). Below, picture two, sixties\nstudent strums happily on guitar (probably\n'Hippy Hippy Shake' con expression e!). Framed masterpiece (Picasso or early\nConstable) is propped nonchalantly again sl curtains, thus preventing them being opened\nto reveal fine view of V&A scaffolding. Second\nmusical instrument enters scene (lop le fl), suspended precariously above adoring lans,\nincluding girl from first photo.\nBut what's this? My well thumbed copy ol\nStudent Residence Halls and bo uses Regulations and Information 1980/1 reveals,\nunder section 11:\n11 Considerable annoyance can he caused\nto other members of the community hv\nex ces i ue noise, residents are not permitted to\nplay or practise musical instruments in study\nbedrooms.\nBreaking college regulations is obviously\none side of life in a study bedroom!\nPage 10 FEUX, December 5, 1980\n\n"

A sIam, to quote my job description:\" responsible for the supervision of the resources of the Union,\" and Canoe Club equipment is \" . . . the general property of the Union...\"( ByeLaw18 Ownership of Property), I was most surprised, as was the rest of the Executive, that \u00a3 1 , 0 0 0 worth of personal equipment is stored in the Canoe Cellar, and that\" this situation... exists in many other clubs.\" We had certainly not been officially informed of this practice, and whilst I admire the trust displayed by the owners in that any other member of the club could\"... walk off with somebody else s personal equipment, without permission, and with the chance of seriously damaging it, \" I sincerely hope such equipment is clearly marked with the owner's name( to avoid the above) and is also adequately insured, as it is not included on our policy( or if it is, it is\nfraud eu lent ly included).

Dear FELIX\nAndy thinks you' re much better than Guildsheel. In fact, we all think you' re a bundle of fun, and so concerned for our safety and wellbeing. Your letters page is a hotbed of discussion, and we all delight in Aunt De id re's adventures( so naughty in places, isn't it?).\nNow Mr Mooney is going to\nproduce wondrous delicacies after being given a damned good talking to in the interview printed by your brave editor Mr Marshal l.I've never seen him, but I'm sure he must be very handsome as well as being so\nobviously witty and intelligent.

So, keep up the good work; your investigative work makes the Washington Post look like Beano!\nAll the best\nNick Miller ME2 PS: Feel free to edit according to\nyour prejudices. Thank you oh so much for your kind\ncomments about FELIX - Ed.\nDear Sir\nWith reference to your last\nedition's hit squad cover story, I note that, while you gave a brief mention to the mass hit on BE2,\nyou said nothing about the mass hit on BE1 by the hit squad during a joint lecture with EE1. The entrance of the hit squad, led by Be nB our dillon, was marked by the appearance, in the hands of BE1, of several shaving foam can s, equipped with long distance nozzles; also several washing up liquid bottles filled with water, not to mention a bucket, also filled with water. In the carnage that followed, during which one half of the lecture theatre became submerged under bodies and shaving loam, the hit squad, and a large proportion o lEE1( who ordered the mass hit), got more than they delivered, and, to quote one of the opposition:\" BE1 definitely beatus\". Afterwards, Dr Spence continued his lecture, although many of us had had our notes washed away. We feel very hurt that you did not consider this to be worthy of a mention, since you are known to disapprove of the hit squad, and this must surely be the only, time that the hit squad got more than they expected. Tours faithfully\nBrendan' S miler' Smith BE1 Our 'mole' in EE1 felt too ashamed to\nreport this incident - Ed.\nDear Sir\nAs a member of the Aeronautics department I have been involved recently in showing prospective students of aeronautics around the College. I was surprised to\nfind that some interviewees were asking if the department was going to close in the near future. As you can imagine, this is a fairly important question to ask if\nyou intend to take a three year course at this college. This impression had been gained from an article in the Alternative\nProspectus which is circulated with the ordinary College prospectus. I wrote the departmental entry and had not included a reference to the Rector's suggestion of last\nyear. I obtained a copy of the Alternative Prospectus, and found that a reference to the Rector's proposal was included in an article about' The Future For Imperial College'. While allowing that it is important to mention the unfavourable economic situation, I think that the inclusion of a^ specific paragraph stating that\" it has been suggested that the department as such should be dissolved\" is irresponsible. I would have been grateful for an opportunity to discuss the article with the editor of the Alternative Prospectus, Gary Nichols, but was never given such an opportunity.

The technique known as playing\nthe man, seemed to have been mastered\nby most of the side and was practised in a tiresomely unsubtle fashion by one of their\nfrontmen. A vicious kick on Jim Beer meant\nthat he became the subject of some extremely\nfirm tackles from Lakin and Niccolls.\nAmidst all this, IC played some excellent\nfootball and scored three memorable goals.\nThe first of these came when Carr rifled his\nshot across the penalty area and just inside\nthe far post. The fifth goal came when Carr\nrounded several challenges and fed the\noverlapping Drabble whose low cross turned\nin at the near post by Veenman, who then\ncompleted his hattrick in fine style when he\ncut inside his man and hit a right foot drive\ninto the top corner of the net.\nThe sorry RHC performance was capped\nwhen their keeper dropped an innocuous\nback pass and the alert Saunders nipped in to\nmake the final score 9-1.\nTEAM: Veats, Drabble, Beer, Armstrong, .\nLakin, Griffiths, Niccolls, Clarke, Veenman,\nCarr, Saunders.\nJim Beer\nRCS Hockey\nHAMPERED from the start by having more\nshirts than players, RCS had to resort to\nusing all available bar props. After a scenic\nroute to the ground, 'the lads' arrived to find\none opponent \u2014 a considerable improvement on the previous four weeks. By an act of\ndiplomacy, LSE then managed to have all ten\navailable players on the field.\nRCS then proceeded to totally dominate\nthe first half, although, LSE managed to score\ntwice. RCS moved well off the ball, and were\nstill two down at half-time. In one of his two\ninspired decisions, Robyn decided that he\nwould do less damage as umpire than on the\nfield, RCS scoring almost immediately.\nHowever, with only thr it y seconds to go and\nthe sun setting behind the gasworks, the\nsecond inspired decision was to send off one\nLSE player for claiming that he was being\nthreatened by the entire RCS team. The final\nresults was 2 - 1 to LSE. Thanks to the\nGuildsmen who helped out.\nTEAM: Hutchings, Parker, Rogers, Sharpe,\nDowning, Purdey, Sirs, Taylor, Waters,\nCornwell, Farrington, Morgan.\nResults: Saturday, November 29\nHockey\nIC 3rd XI\nBasketball\nIC 1st IC 2nd Ladies\nBank of England\nQMC I QMC II\nQMC\n2-2\no87426691953 Hockey Thirds\nON A DAY when Hariington was water bound\nthe long awaited match against the Bank of\nEngland was played in near perfect conditions. The dampness around the pitch was nothing\ncompared with the post match refreshments\nat 32p per pint.\nPre match worries concerning the whereabouts of Mike Clift and reserve goalkeeper\nPhil Webb were cast aside when we realised\nthat the bar opens before the match.\nPlaying with the tide in the first half, IC took\nthe lead through Dave Cornwell following\nexcellent work by Tim Mitchell on the left\nwing. Some fine, if somewhat unorthodox\nplay between sweeper Rob Morgan and a deep playing centre back (keeper) Phil Webb\nkept this as the only score at half-time.\nEarly in the second half, following the\ninspired substitution of Pete Hughes, the IC\nside's defence lapsed and allowed Bank to\nscore twice. Late on Andy Purdy scored his\nfirst (of many) goal for IC to retain the third\nelevens undefeated away record.\nFollowing waitress service of the post\nmatch dinner the side adjourned to the bar for\na pleasant evening.\nTEAM: Webb, Morgan, Sharpe, Leinster,\nPurdy, Clift, Hampton, Hughes, Mitchell\n(Capt), Wylie, Taylor, Cornwell.\nSailing\nON SATURDAY, THE IC team raced UL 2 at\nWelsh Harp. After a preliminary snowball\nfight to break the ice, the first race\ncommenced. From the start, the IC team\nadopted an aggressive stance and rammed\nUL boats twice (when having right of way)\nthus inflicting penalty points and only had to\nhold the trailing UL boat in last place to win,\nbut they decided to form a huddle at the\nleeward mark of the last beat instead. IC\nfinished second, fifth and sixth, after some\nfast sailing by Mills and Kennedy and some\nslow sailing by Murray. Even with the\npenalties, this gave UL 2 the match by the\nnarrowest of margins.\nIn the second race, IC started well, but\ndangerously close covering by UL and\nincredibly slow mark rounding s by the feared\nUL 2 captain put them into a first, second, and\nthird lead by the start of the last lap. At this\npoint at the gybe mark, Palmer of UL decided\nto do a Firefly rail ride, and Mills and Kennedy,\npumped their way past the enemy captain\nusing their legendary pelvic thrust, this\nforced them to sail part of the first beat the\nwrong way and the two remaining UL boats\nsat closely on the gallant IC squad and sailed\ncautiously over the line.\nTEAM: Murray, Redman, Chadwick,\nYounghusband, Mills, Kennedy.\nWater Polo\nTHREE WEEKS AGO, the polo team played\ntheir final match of the Middlesex League\nagainst the Penguin team at Isleworth. It was\nan important game, as neither team had lost\nany of their previous matches and this final\nmatch determined the No 1 place in the\ndivision. There was a good turnout of\nSpooner Allstars for the event. The game was\nvery hard fought but IC stayed in control for\nmost of the match, and managed to win by\nfour goals to three. So we win the fourth\ndivision and play in the third division this\ncoming season.\nThe next major event was the UL U Swimming Championships held in the\nUniversity pool in Malet Street. The Imperial\nteam was probably the best represented\ncollege there. Heffeman won the mens 110\nyard backstroke, Wilton won the 110yd s ladies breaststroke and the College came\nsecond overall in the competition.\nLast week it was the turn of the polo players\nat the UL U Water Polo Championships.\nImperial entered two teams, and both\ncrushed their opposition in the first round but\nthe second team came unstuck against a well-prepared London Hospital first team in\nthe next round. Our first team continued to\nplay well and reached the semi-final, with\nspecial help from Leach who kept the team\ntogether, and Heffman who scored twice in\nthe quarter-finals. In the semi-finals we were\nmatched against an under-manned team from\nKings College. Although we dominated the\ngame, their goalie was mainly responsible for\nkeeping the score to 'one all'. The match was\ndecided on penalties which Kings won by\nfour goals to three. Great goal keeping by our\nIan, but an unfortunate result.\nSnooker\nTHE B TEAM won away to QMC by just one\nframe. A most impressive victory considering.\n'We witnessed a fine win by Kelly suffering\nfrom a severe injury. Bennett and Cameron\nalso won to bring our tally to three frames and\na memorable victory.\nThe C team and A team played with each\nother last week. The result was not as clear-cut as forecast by Proudlove (Captain of A team) and his band of merry men. The\noutcome was 3-2 in favour of the A team. Cox\n(Captain of C team) was rather unfairly not\nallowed to play by Proudlove on a technical\nmatter. If he had played I fear the A team\nwould have won by a bigger margin than they\ndid.\nFencing\nCONGRATULATIONS to the team on a well\ndeserved victory over KC by seventeen bouts\nto fourteen. After a shaky start the second\nmens foil won 5-4. A special mention goes to\nBartfleet and Perkins for excellent per-form ances. The ladies foil was a draw 2-2.\nIn the Epee we lost 3-6, although this was\nthe first time in many years that we have\nfielded an Epee team.\nThe mens team won 7-2, clinching victory for\nthe match. Well done all, and good luck for\ntonight against Ealing College.\nBasketball\nFirsts\nA well competed game with the lead\nalternating between the two sides, that finally\nfell by a short margin to QMC due to superior\nfitness, showing us up in the last few minutes.\nSeconds\nAlthough the half-time score reflected a fairly\ntight game (18-22), in the second half,\nImperial College fell apart at the seams and\nQMC deservedly went home with a comfortable victory.\nLadies\nA rather rough game which ended in victory\nfor QMC who had a larger number of non-novice players, making a big difference.\nFELIX, December 5, 1980 p \u201e ge u "

It c once ern s the\ndecline and fall of Mac 'the Knife' Heath (Viv\nBrown) a small time crook. He marries the\ndaughter of JJ Peachum (Alan Minney), who\ncontrols Londons beggars (\"the poorest of the\npoor\"). Peachum then proceeds to bring him\nto justice by blackmailing the corrupt Police\nChief (Graham Brand).\nThere is a certain risk in casting a woman as\nthe male lead, however, Viv Brown is visually\nvery credible and her acting ability certainly\nallows her to be very believable in the role.\nNevertheless, it is somewhat disconcerting\nw, hen she breaks into a soprano solo. Alan\nMinney, as MacHeaths nemesis Peachum also\nrose to the occasion, almost exuding malice, he\ninfact gave a very authoritative performance.\nAs his daughter, Polly, Lulu Dazeley ably\nperforms the transition from the wedding day\ninnocent to the cynical accomplice. Of the supporting players space permits mention of only a few: Graham Brand was excellent as the weak\ncorrupt Police Chief and Gareth Davies was a very com pet ant Filch.\nThe cast combined best in the second act in\nthe jail scene, which brought the best out of\nthe cast. In fact, the level of acting was\npleasantly surprising. It was with the songs\nthat the cast became unsure, some of the early\nsinging was of variable quality, but in the\nsecond act it became of a more consistent and\ncompetent level.\nOne final mention is due to the set changing\ncrew and its chief, Ian Cairns, who raised a cheer from the audience. All in all, it provided\nan entertaining evening, and was a very\nl audible effort by all concerned.\nSteve Goulder\nLightwave Distributors present\nTHE TRAVELLER\nIN THE\nFOREST,\na film by Roger Stotesbury,\nstarring Suki Kalirai.\nSHOWING AT THE SOUTHSIDE PENTHOUSE ON14 th,15 th AND16 th JANUARY.1981.

    "content": "Canoe Club\nA GROUP of IC paddlers attended the Mike Jones Memorial Rally on the River Dee last\nweekend. We found the river at a reasonably high level, thus providing some very exciting\ncanoeing. On Saturday morning the IC paddlers were first on the water and avoided the\novercrowding that later took place on the river.\nOn arriving at Ll an goll en we were met by large\ncrowds eager to see the first canoeists to negotiate the' Town Rapid'. Later trips down the\nriver on Saturday were hindered by the large\nnumbers of paddlers. On Saturday evening two films were shown in\n' the Town Hall. One was a documentary about, Mike Jones' sEx pei d it on to the Blue Nile, and the\nother featured some o( Britain'stop paddlers at\nthe moment, including three ex members of IC Canoe Club. Sunday morning saw the cold really beginning to bite, with some wet clothes having frozen solid\novernight, and large quantities of ice in the canoes. Again IC was among the first on the water and able to have another clear rundown the river. Due to the extreme cold we left the river\nunusually early and were able to make a relatively\nearly return to London. The weekend provided a valuable opportunity for those entering the Universities WhiteWater Race to explore the river where the event will be.held, increasing their chances of winning.

HAMSOC\nAS ONE TERM drags on ot its icy end, I'm sure everyone's thoughts a returning to what to do\nwith those long empty Wednesday afternoons, next term. Why not take up Amateur Radio( well.\nWhy not?)?\nIf you like fiddling with electronics, freezing to\ndeath on roofs putting aerials up. or even if all you\nwant to do is talk to other people, and make new\nfriends all over the wor lc i. then you should conic\nalong to HAM SOC's Radio Amateurs course starting at1:00p minE lec Eng1207 on Wednesday, January14. To get on the air, legally, you must obtain a Home Office transmitting licence. All you need to\ndo to qualify for one( class B.as opposed to class\nA, which also requires morse) is to pass the Radio Amateurs Examination, a simple multiple choice test for which our course gives ( more than)\nadequate preparation. A student from IC would find this test very much of a walkover( last year,\nthere was a100 \u00b0 , success rate amongst our\nmembers who took the exam), so if you're\ninterested, please come along. It's free, and\neveryone is welcome, though if you want our\nprinted notes, we will have to make a small\ncharge. Several other things are happening next term. We have managed to arrange several talks, including some people from Cable and Wireless Ltd, and expert on optical communication and the dreaded G4C TP, who has risen from his museum case to show u show to make simple2 m aerials.\nHopefully a pub crawl or so, a few visits and, of course, the HAM SOC Annual Dinner will be forthcoming. Members interested in sawing and filing things are needed for the microwave project, which can now get underway again, as we' ve got\nour book back! Anyone with any other ideas for\nHAMS OCto do, please let me know. Finally, I would like to thank that dynamic duo, Pete Mead and his amazing micro, for organising and running an amazingly good morse course.

    "content": "Twat of the Week\nThe prize this week must surely go to Mark\nClegg (President of Conservative Society) who\nspoke out against a motion at Tuesday'sU GM calling for unilateral disarmament.\nWhile disagreeing with the motion myself, I thought that his amendment was too extreme.\nHis method of oratory was so ludicrous as to\ngive unilateral disarmament a certain credibility which Owen Greene(proposer of\nthe motion) played on well to his advantage.\nWould the following romantic is ed type of\ndialogue convince YOU? \"How would all you red-blooded males react\nto a scantily-clad Aphrodite tripping through\nthe long grass . . . we must smash this Russian\nRipper!\" After this, Mr Clegg allowed \"William\nCortazzi to speak against the motion which\nwas equally hilarious and earned a huge cheer\nfrom the audience.\nIt's about time that Mess rs Clegg and Cortazzi stopped trying to emulate men such\nas Sir Winston Churchill - their audience is far\ntoo intelligent to appreciate it.\nSouthside Security\nIt's nice to see that the bolts on the Southside\nfire escapes have been removed and the\nproper locks installed.\nHowever, the doors on gallery level are still\nnot being locked at night, allowing access to\nanyone who climbs over the fire escape gates.

If the conductor tells the committee he has\nadopted two suggestions, he might have\nchosen Haydn and Bach or he mich t have\nchosen just Bach. As the committee do not\nknow which, the game is not given away\ncompletely.\nSimilarly if three suggestions are adopted,\nthe committee cannot distinguish just Mozart\nfrom just Haydn.\nNow if four suggestions are adopted, it\nappears that Mozart, Haydn, Handel is the\nonly choice. But nowhere was it said that the\nconductor is limited to the composers\nmentioned, so Beethoven, Haydn, Handel is\nequally valid.\nSo we are left to deduce that the conductor\nrefused to say that he had adopted only one\nsuggestion; and Bach, Handel is the only\npossibility.\nWas it excessively sneaky to make it look as\nif I had set a problem without a unique solution\nagain? I don't think so. It fooled most of the\nregular solvers, and the prize goes to David\nPashley, BE2, who was one of the two who got\nit completely right.\nThis week's puzzle is rather hard, to get you\nin training for the giant puzzle page in next\nweek's Christmas FELIX. So there is a prize of\n\u00a35 which will go to the first correct entry\nopened on Wednesday noon, and if no entries\nare absolutely correct, a reduced prize (down\nto a minimum of \u00a32) will go to the entry which,\nin my opinion, is most nearly correct.\nFELIX is published by the Editor for and on behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board, and is printed by the Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road, London,\nSW7 2BB.(589 Sill ext. 1048/int. 2S81) Copyright FELIX 1980.

    "content": "mey Money\nIf you have to pay rent over the vacation you\nmay be able to claim Supplementary Benefit\nor Rent and Rate Rebates. Here are some\nfacts and figures.\nSupplementary Benefit\nSince a successful claim for SB entails\nsigning on at the unemployment benefit\noffice in the area of your accommodation, the\namount of time you remain in London may\ndetermine which benefit you apply for. You\nnormally have to sign on once a week,\nalthough you can apply to have this changed\nto fortnightly. Also you may find that your\nsigning on day falls into the holiday periods,\nwhen the offices will be closed. Otherwise ask\nfor a holiday form, allowing you to be away\nfor up to fourteen days.\nHow To Apply For SB\n1. Register as available for work at your\nnearest Job Centre, then, assuming that there\nIQ job available, tell the clerk that you wish\nto register as unemployed. He will give you a card. Also ask for form B1, which is your\nintroduction to the DHSS Office.\n2. Take the card to the unemployment\nbenefit office for your area, where you will\nreceive instructions about signing on in the\nfuture.\n3. It may be advisable to phone the DHSS\noffice first since some operate an appointments system. When you finally arrive make sure\nyou have the B1 form, a rent book, letter from\nyour landlord (or the Residence Office if in\nCollege accommodation) and your union card. How SB Is worked out\n1. Calculate your requirements. This is what\nyou need each week. For householders, i.e., those living alone, this is \u00a321.30, plus the rent.\nFor non-householders this is\u00a317.05, plus rent.\n2. Calculate your resources, for most people\nthis will be \u00a319.20, the vacation element of the\ngrant.\n3. Deduct what you have from what you\nneed. The amount left may be the sum\npayable as SB.\n4. This is where the final adjustments come\nin to increase or decrease the benefit. Firstly,\njoint householders get extra for living\nexpenses. This is the difference between the\nhouseholder and non-householder scale\nrates (\u00a34.25) divided by the number of joint\nhouseholders. Reductions may involve any of\nthe following if they are included in the rent:\nheating, \u00a34.35; hot water, 50p; cooking, 50p, and lighting, 35p. If your rent has not been\nfair assessed and seems higher than average\nthe calculations may be based on a rent more\nin line with similar accommodation that has\nbeen fair rented. Apart from this factor the\nDHSS (Department of Health and Social\nSecurity) have a maximum of \u00a319 rent for\nsingle householders; \u00a314 for share rs; \u00a324 for\na double beds it and \u00a324 for a one bedroomed\nflat. The term householder implies someone\nwho is individually responsible for all\nhousehold expenses. However, it is not\nprecisely defined, so even if you live in a student house it may be possible, if you have\nyour own room, to argue that you are\nmaintaining a seperate household. The\ncalculations for your SB will be presented to\nyou on form A124, and if you disagree with\ntheir assessment you are free to appeal within\ntwenty-one days.\nAnyone receiving SB is automatically\nentitled to receive free NHS dental treatment\nand glasses, and free prescriptions, so ask for\nan exemption certificate from the DHS S office if you think you might be needing any\nof these.\nMoney Mon\nRent and Rate Rebate\nThis is the alternative method for those who\nwill be at home for the whole holiday period.\nIn some cases it may be worthwhile applying\nfor rebates during term time also. Different\nrules apply for this, so for further details\ncome and see us at the Welfare Centre.\nHow to work out rent allowance and rate\nrebate for the vacation\nQuite substantial deductions may be made\nfrom the total rent on which you are assessed.\nFirst of all the rent will be equated with similar\naccommodation which has been fair rented.\nThen a25% deduction is usually made for\nfurniture with a further amount deducted (up\nto 25%) if heating is included in the rent. The\nrate element, usually 25%, is also removed,\nbut this will be subject to a subsequent\nrebate. The basic rebate will be 60% of what\nremains. Furthermore, if your income is less\nthan the housing benefit needs allowance\n(\u00a334.90) then 25% of the difference between\nthe income and the needs allowance is added\nto the basic figure. For a student with a higher\nincome than the needs allowance the basic\nrate is reduced by 17% of the difference\nbetween their income and the needs\nallowance.\nThe rate rebate is not subjected to any\ninitial reductions. If your income is less than\nyour needs allowance the 60% rebate is\nincreased by 8% of the difference between\nyour income and the needs allowance. If your\nincome is more than the needs allowance\nyour rebate is reduced by 6% of the difference\nbetween your income and the needs\nallowance.\nWhile people on rent and rate rebates\ncannot automatically apply for other benefits\nit is worth remembering that anyone with an\nincome of no more than \u00a32.50 above their SB\nlevel can qualify for the usual free benefits,\ni.e., dental treatment, glasses, prescriptions.\nHow To Apply\nGo to the Town Hall for your area. If you are\nnot in any of the boroughs listed below ring\nup your Town Hall and ask where the rent and\nrebate department is since they are not\nalways in the main building, Kensington and\nChelsea Borough forms can be collected\nfrom the Welfare Centre.\nOverseas Students\nSince your conditions of stay say that you\nmust not at any time have recourse to public\nfunds any application for benefits would\njeopardize your right to stay here. If you are\nin serious financial difficulties however, come\nand see us at the Welfare Centre.\nUnemployment Benefit\nIn order to qualify for benefit this Christmas\nyou must have paid Class 1 contributions on\nweekly earnings of at least fifty times the\nweekly lower earnings limit in one of the last\ntwo tax years. What this bit of official\ngobbledygook means is: earnings of at least\n\u00a3750 between April 1977 and April 1978 or\n\u00a3875 between April 1978 and April 1979. You\nwill get a flat rate of \u00a320.65 plus any earnings-related supplement and dependants allowance if appropriate. The new eight week rule\nprevents claims made during the Easter\nvacation from being assessed as part of the\nsame period (and therefore previously\nassessed on the same tax year) as the\nChristmas claim.\nThis benefit should be claimed on the first\nday of the vacation since any delay results in\nlost benefit. It is also worthwhile remembering\nthat if you have worked before becoming a student you may be entitled to sickness\nbenefit, at least during your first year at\nCollege.\nNEAREST OFFICES FOR COLLEGE HEAD\nTENANCIES\nHamlet Gardens\nJob Centre and Unemployment Benefit Office:\nHythe House, 200 Shepherds Bush Rd, W6\nTel: 603 3456\nSupplementary Benefit Office: Charles House,\n375 High St, Kensington, W14.\nTel: 603 4633\nTown Hall: Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, 5 Nigel Playfair Ave (off King St), W6\nTel: 748 3020\nGerrard Mansions\nJob Centre and Unemployment Benefit Office:\nChadwick St, SW1\nTel: 222 8060\nSupplementary Benefit Office:\n4 Regency St, SW1\nTele: 834 8433\nTown Hall: Westminster Council House,\nMarylebone Rd (nr Baker St Station)\nTel: 828 8070 ext 4176\nLexham Gardens/Earls Ct Sq/Redcliffe St\nJob Centre and Unemployment Benefit Office:\nWyfold Rd, SW6\nTel: 385 2241\n(70/74 bus, ask for Kingwood Rd)\nSupplementary Benefit Office: Waterford\nHouse, Waterford Rd, SW6\nTel: 736 3399\nTown Hall: Kensington and Chelsea, Hornton\nSt, W8\nTel: 937 5464\n(R&R Rebate forms for this area are available\nat the Welfare Centre.)\nAccommodation for Next Term\n(Or Sooner)\nA Several un modernised and unfurnished\nflats for one and two people within fifteen\nminutes walk of College.\nFlats For One - 2rms and WC\nBedroom, bathroom and kitchen together in\nsecond room, seperate WC, hall. \u00a36.21-\u00a37.27\nper week.\nFlats For Two - 3rms and WC\nSame as flats for one with additional room off\nbedroom. \u00a38.16-\u00a39.46 per week for whole flat.\nFlats completely unfurnished and need\ncarpet, cooker and furniture (some have old\ncooker and some have lino).

    "content": "Founded in 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\n17 MARCH ON RHODES\nSeventeen students from Imperial College attended last\nFriday's march In opposition to the Government's proposals on\nStudent Union Financing. The march was Jointly organised by\nthe University of London Union (ULU) and the National Union\nof Students (NUS). The Imperial College Union Banner was\ncarried by students who were not members ol the ICU Exec. No\nICU Exec member went on the march.\nThe Police estimated that 11,000 students attended the\nLondon demo, this Included an Impressive turnout of 600\nstudents from Huddersfleld Polytechnic.\nAt the recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee the Government is changing the method of funding Britain' s800 student unions. Two weeks ago, the Department of Education and Science finally accepted the National Union of Students estimates on the total amount of public funds received by Union this year. The reason for Friday's demonstration was that the Government has not yet given adequate guarantees to protect the legal and financial independence of student unions. Students are not asking for more money \u2014 agreement has been reached on the sums involved. They simply want firm guarantees that the money promised will be paid to their unions. TheN US state:' Student unions are not political organisations. They are an essential part of college life, just like j a library or canteen. Student unions provide welfare facilities, shops, bars, entertainments, and sportsclub s for all students at each college.\" Sexism Fine!\nAfrican-Carribean Society were fined \u00a310 last week for\nsexual discrimination after posters for their party on Nov\n22nd were brought to President John Passmore's attention.\nThey announced an admission\nfee of El would be charged;\nladies, however, would be\nadmitted free of charge. John\nPassmore, verbally warned Mr\nDar6 Afolabi (President of the\nAfrican-Caribbean Society)\nthat the poster was blatant\nsexual discrimination, and\nhence was in infringement of\nCouncil policy which forbids\nsplit pricing at events on Union\npremises. A subsequent written warning was sent to Mr\nAfolabi by the President.\nAt an Executive meting, it\nwas decided to fine the African-Caribbean Society \u00a310 (to\nbe added to the Third World\nScholarship Fund) for their\ndiscriminatory action.\nMr. D. Afolabi\nWifli court\nUNION\" In addition to the \u00a3 2 2 . lm student unions receive from public funds, student unions generate another \u00a3 4 0 m through commercial services and throughout Britain employ over4,000 staff.\"\" Student unions also encourage their members to help local community groups and raise cash for charity. Last year students raised well over \u00a3 lm for needy people.\" ICU Rag'79/80 raised over \u00a3 2 0 , 0 0 0 ) .\nTheN US hoped that the public would arge e that student unions deserve to be protected. The public reaction on Friday was varied. Many frustrated motorists mattered' bloody students' as they spent half an hour waiting for the demonstration to pass. On Monday FELIX interviewed James Prior, the Secretary of State for Employment. Mr Prior hadn' the ard about the march and when told that11,000 students had marched passed the DES shouting,' Boys on Out', he commented,\" That' s about par for he course.\" ICU President, John Passmore, was in Zurich at the time of the march; however, none of the other five members of the Union Executive saw fit to attend. This lack of representation contravenes ICU Policy of December1979' Public Image of ICU' which instructs\" a representative of the ICU Exec to attend all student events featuring IC that receive media coverage\". The march was publicised by LBC before Friday, and many news reports appeared in Saturday's national newspapers. When asked to comment, John Passmore said:\" I don't think any NUS march achieves anything. Every year theN US campaigns about a different issue. With one million members they should expect to get 1 1 , 0 0 0 at a London demo. That' s1%... Wow big deal! The Imperial contingent was led by Phil Cole, ICU External All airs Officer. Phil was pleased with the response from Imperial. However, because of a snowstorm only two students from IC completed the march. They were Mr Cole and the FELIX photographer.

    "content": "Closure Controversy\ncontinued from front page\ndemo to visit the pubs which lined the route from Waterloo to Hyde Park. Ironically, the blizzard was strongest as the march pas ed the hostelry named' The Per server ance'. On Monday, Harry Ewing, MP, asked four Parliamentary Questions about student union financing. Mr Rhodes Boys on, MP, replied for the Secretary of State for Education. Mr Boys on confirmed that the DES would implement the changes in student union financing at the beginning of the1981/2 session. Next Monday, John Passmore, will discuss student union financing with Rhodes Boys on. He was granted a special interview because Imperial is not in theN US. Ramp rumpus\nRECENT bicycle thefts have led many students who come into College on bikes to park their cycles in safer, less accessible area sol College. In particular, a growing number ol students have locked their cycles to the access ramps at Me chEng and Maths. However, this has meant that it\nis becoming increasingly more difficult lor disabled students and members of staff to get into College. Dr Learner of the Physics stall' who himself uses a wheelchair made the point that all of the ramp is needed lor him to manoeuvre up. Dr Learner d has been campaigning strongly in the past to improve facilities lor the disabled at Imperial College. This carelessness certainly highlights the problems ol' the disabled especially in this the International Yea i of thc Disabled. Ii also highlights the lack of provision lore ve lists at Imperial College.

One paragraph particularly effects Imperial:\" Queen Elizabeth, a science college of just over1,000 students is also vulnerable. A merger with Imperial College, another pure science institution,' maybe a solution\". The Times disclosures about the future of London University, as seen by the S winner ton Dyer Committee have created a tidal wave of criticism. Leading UL U College figures have started' bitching' in public. Westfield College is also in danger of closure and Dr Brian Thwaite s, Principal of the College growled:\" Sir PeterS winner ton Dyer's credibility amongst staff and students of the University is now zero.\" Sir Peter was not content to sit\nback and listen to the arguments which followed The Times disclosure for on Wednesday The\nTimes printed a letter from Sir Peter. The letter which was dated as having been written in the first week of November( a typographical error, one would assume) began:\" Sir,I have just seen the report into day's Times relating to the University of London' s Committee on academic organisations and the conclusions it might reach.\" Double Con\nThe letter from Sir Peter denied the claim made( that this committee will be recommending closures), he stated that the document to be published next month will be a discussion paper and contains no firm proposals. FELIX asked ICU President, John Passmore to comment. He said\" There could be a mole or Sir Peter may have tried to double con. It is odd that his letter was printed so quickly by The Times. Perhaps he is trying to promote public interest.\" John was careful to point out that t ne word' merger' can mean several things. QE C could close a'.d their students may join IC courses;; QE C could be com; the home of one or two complete departments that are at present at IC or the Administration of QE C could betaken over by Imperial. The new threat to London colleges has meant that the Association of University Teachers have begun to campaign to stop redundancies.\" We will fight to the end in terms of protecting our members jobs,\" said one officer. Sir Peter said he hoped\" redundancies would not be necessary, savings could be made through natural wastage.\" Passmore\nromps home\nMR JOHN PASSMORE, ICU President has recently returned from celebrating the125 Anniversary of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Mr Passmore told FELIX that he thought the visit worthwhile. There were students from all over Europe, but the Institute's own students boycotted the event, this being because of the current unrest amongst young people in Switzerland. During a torchlight procession lor the visitors, the home students marked alongside, lot he Town Hall and broke some ol the windows there. Rape Alarm!\nON SUNDAY, LBC Led with the news story that Bradford University will bring a motion to theN US Conference stat. ng that women students shot Id be armed. This follows the Ripper's attacks on students at Bradford and Leeds. Bradford Union propose that if the Police catch a female student carrying a knife then theN US should give the woman full support. ICU Deputy President, Rae S nee, told Tuesday's U GM that ICU are buying several small personal alarms. On Saturday, May7,1980 a female student was raped it\nSouthside. Therapist, has not been caught. Page 3\nUGM Report\nTHE FINAL ICU GM of term was not only the most controversial so\nfar but also the best attended; estimates varying from500 to600. As the meeting was opened there was a proposal to change the order of the Agenda to debate Nuclear Disarmament and the South Africa motions immediately after the Returning Officers Report. This was quickly followed by another Point of Order to move the motion on the FELIX Editor and debate it before the changes in the ByeLaws. Both were pasted by a clear majority. The Union President. John Passmore. then gave his report. He confirmed that DES had confirmed that the capita tion would be \u00a3 4 4\nnot \u00a3 3 2 ) . This he said would be enough lor Imperial but many the r universities are at present run on capit at ions that are much higher. Another major issue brought to light was the drop in overseas applications received b yUCCA, there may even be a chance of an MSc course closing. The hustings for the Ordinary Member ok l'P WP were held and the results were as follows:(. am hilt it tI\\l(. mull 2nti I't e11' leu ft 3rd/ 'tt'/fr rn rr Tim Lawes 51 <7 \u2014\nC God in22~ \u2014\nM Led wold M r,H BO\nB McCabe95' \u00ab 1 1 i Barney Me Ca be was i bu duly elected subject lo ratification al the nc xlI' CM.

    "content": "Charlotte Rampling and Woody Allen in \"Stardust Memories\".\nReviews\nFilms\nTo begin with, a quick look at some recent\nreleases.\nJohn Carpenter's The Fog (AA) turns out\nto be nothing at all to do with James Herbert's novel of the same name. It concerns the return\nof the mysterious, q lowing fog to downtown\nAntonio Bay, 100 years after the settlement's founders drew a ship full of lepers onto the\nrocks and stole their gold. Needless to say, the\nfog harbours the crew of salty lepers, who\nwield hooks and swords with relish to get fi eir own back. Mr Herbert's rage over having his\ntitle k nicked is understandable when it CDuld\njust as easily have been called 'The Leperous\nSeamen's Revenge'. I wasn't impressed.\nAnother contender in the recent blood and\nguts stakes is The Island (X, Michael\nRitchie), a tale with both much in evidence. 1\ncan believe that an ambitious reporter would\nwish to explain the disappearance of hundreds\nof ships in the Caribbean, but why he should\ntake his son along 1 don't know. As for the idea\nof a band of pirates who haven't changed their\nways (over hundreds of years on an isolated\nisland) and still grab the odd few ships! Well,\nI'm stunned. The story turns out to be\nreasonably enjoyable, but I' mafia id the lack of\nso many vital factors (like a convincing story)\nmake the whole film pointless.\nTalking about pointlessness, a prime\nexample is The Awakening( X, Mike Newell), Charlton Heston plays an Egyptologist who discovers the tomb of Kara, a most\nevil queen who is also known as the nameless\none. Irt a frantic effort to avoid genre clich es, we are taken over a long and boring trail to a dismally disappointing end. When, eventually,\nHeston gets to putting the mummy through its\nrevival ritual, nothing happens except that his\neighteen year old daughter becomes possessed.\nThere is no bandaged figure wandering\naround strangling people at random, indeed if\nConcerts\nSAD CAFE are something of an enigma.\nHaving become successful commercially they\nhave lost most of their originality, and yet the\nsongs which come over best in their live show\nare the new ones.\nIt was evident at the Hammersmith Odeon\nlast week that over the last two years they\nhave been practising their rock star\nimpressions. Vocalist Paul Young struts\naround like Rod Stewart and pouts like Mick\ndagger, while Ashley Mulford chews his guitar\nand Vic Emerson flails himself a la Wakeman.\nOnly original guy was Ian Wilson, who having\nfallen off stage the week before, had swapped\nhis guitar for percussion and plaster cast.\nA distinctly ageing audience went crazy over\nEvery Day Hurts and My Oh My but the\ndeathly silence during older songs suggested\nthere were few supporters from the early\nalbums. Black Rose, which is without doubt\none of the strongest recorded songs, came\nover as very weak when played live, while new\nmaterial like La-Di-Da and What Am I Gonna\nDo sounded much stronger. Somehow the\nband seemed out of place. The typical mega-rock light show was there, but didn't quite\nthere had have been it would have probably\nreturned straight back to the tomb due to\nboredom. A waste of time.\nOn to more joyful tidings. The Christmas\nseason brings the usual batch of big releases,\nincluding the new Flash Gordon, The Dogs o) War, Clint Eastwood's Any Which Way You\nCan, and many more. I hope to look at these in\nlater weeks.\nFirstly though, an advance look at Woody\nAllen's film Stardust Memories, which is\nreleased on December 18.\nAllen plays Sandy Bates, a film director, not\nunlike himself, who has found fame through his\ncomedies, but meets opposition from all\nquarters when he moves on to more serious\ntopics. Indeed, in order to change the ending\nof his most recent work, film company\nex cut ives send him off to a retrospective of\nhis films at the quiet Stardust Hotel. Here, he\nis hounded by fans and bombarded with\nsuggestions. \"I like your early films,\" people\nconstantly say. \"You know, the funny ones.\"\nrecreate the atmosphere of over-indulgent\nextra v agence of other major groups.\nAs for the new album, simply called Sad\nCaji \u2014 well, there are a couple of nice catchy\nsingles on it, but the rest is a rather slushy\ndeterioration of their past \u2014 as always, I suggest you buy Fanx Ta Ra instead.\nJohn Miller\nTheatre\nThe Comic Strip\nTRUSTING the opinion of John Blake's Ad\nLib column of the Evening News (RIP), and\nmore recently Time Out, I ventured into the\nslee zy confines of Soho. Not I hastily add for\nthe purposes you might think, but to witness a novel form of fringe theatre, The Comic Strip.\nSuitably named, the show is composed of\nseveral acts, which vary from week to week,\nwith a resident com per e. The humour is often\nof a topical and seemingly improvised nature.\nIn fact, my second visit to this unlikely\nnight spot bore the appearance of Pamela\nStephenson (not, Not The Nine O 'clock News),\n\"Everybody look to your right and say, 'Don't you turn your back on me you Bas . . . . ' \" .\nThe plot revolves between clips from\nSandy's films, question sessions, and Sandy's memories and fantasies. These mainly concern\nDor rie( Charlotte Ramp ling), but also Isobel ( a lover who comes to join him at the\nhotel) and Daisy (Jessica Harper) who he\nmeets there.\nI was never quite sure which part of Bates'\ncomplicated life 1 was looking at; by hopping\nfrom fact to fantasy to memory a little\nconfusion creeps in, but it maintained the pace\nand packed in an awful lot of comic material.\nAt one point he encounters alien beings and\nasks a series of deeply meaningful questions.\n\"If you wanna do a great service to mankind,\"\nhe's told, \"tell funnier jokes!\"\nAllen seems to be presenting a sharp dig at\nfilm culture \u2014 the film companies, critics, fans\nand all. Some parts are treated very seriously,\nbut even if it doesn't have the speed and\nslapstick of his ear i ler films, it is still a clever\nand very worthwhile comedy.\nMark Smith\nThe theatre has a delightful atmosphere.\nSurprisingly, since it is situated above Paul\nRaymond's Review Bar, the honourable\nprop rie ter of Club International. The Comic\nStrip being his solution to \"What to do with the\nmoney which would have sponsored Mark\nThatcher's motor racing career?\". Though\nhaving had my dig, I must compliment him on\nhis particular business venture.\nMany of the acts use mime, notably the\nDangerous Brothers, with their interpretation\nof \" Space Invaders\". Others are very\nsuggestive, a fake French accent with a pretty\nface and dirty lyrics. But I hope that these acts\nhave long since gone, since the venue will live\nor die on its originality and spontaneity.\nThe price of a pint of lager had a certain\noriginality at 90p, not recommended. As for\nthe com pere's comments after the intermission\nconcerning conversations at the Bar, they\nwere to be sav our ed( though not printed), and\nwell worth \u00a33 admission.\nThe Comic Strip starts every night at 8\no 'clock, with additional performances at 10\no 'clock on Fridays and Saturdays. Situated in\nthe Boulevard Theatre just off Brewer Street\n(near NCP car park), Soho. The place reeks of\nwhat the working population condescendingly\nterm 'student humour', and well worth a visit.\nPhilip Peters\nPage 8 FELIX, December 5, 1980\n\n"
