    "content": "FELIX THE BARBER of CIVIL ENGINEEHMO NOTES 0\" BEARDS\n\" If the beard were all, the goat would preach\". Old Proverb. The beard Is at once the most\nnoticeable, obvious, egotistical, exhibitionist adornment possible and the most natural thing, in the world. Historically, beards have been\nrevered, saved by their unfortunate owners from the block( albeit at the expense of their necks) and singed. They have been used to disguise many\nintentions from the anarchic to the amorous; used to conceal disfigured skins, receding chins and the identities of their owners. Indeed, the beard is usually regarded as a particularly close form of camouflage, which is the great eg t fundamental error in the' lay' public1 s beard wise thinking. For whilst concealing the\nlower half of the face, it renders the whole of it immediately recognisable. Far from being the gesture of the recluse and the hermit, abandoning the razor is an act calling for the strongest of characters, the bravest of men. Thus to step out of line, to leave the \"common herd, is to nail colours to the mast and stand by\none's every deed. No more can the bearded one disappear into the crowd -his reputation will stay with him -the regretted deed can no more be\nescaped. Imagine the copper's wry\nsmile as the maiden says\"... and\nofficer, this man had brown hair and\nblue eyes...\" BUT - picture the frenzy of file searching at the Yard as the Incriminating fact is revealed. \"The police are believed to be\nlooking for a bearded man\".\nAnd we are not without distinguished support, the fabulous 'Bean' Hol be in( Hon.Sec. of the Old Central ian s) sports a growth that is an excellent example of this so fct of tonsorial art.

And we are not without our Royal Patronage Practical hints to those intending to follow the present trend might not come amiss. There is no known\nfertiliser.

Hot\nonly do we eat in perpetual gloom in Mooney^, but about ZOff, of the nam\nlightbulbs in other parts of the building seem to have resigned. This is suitable for Carnivals and\nsimilar orgies, but not for general usage.14. Contractors. 'Winter snows\nare on \"the way, and Harpies and\nRidgeway are hibernating in the Gym\nand the Upper Refectory. Unkind people are saying that the land scape gardeners n ere responsible for removing Marple s'huts.15. More Errors. The Grid ventilation, in the Dining Sail.' was\nfound to be too coarse, exposing brick work to the diners' view. This is to be replaced. The I To tice Eo ard material is of a cardboard like consistency instead of the\nbetter quality ordered. This is to be replaced.16. Windows. Are the windows\ngoing to be cleaned!17. The Bar. Many long cracks have developed in the plaster of the bar. Is it possible that the\ndesigner of the pavement also desi g ned the bar and failed to take into account the resonant effect of carousing voices. I CW A Following Mr. Griffin's correspondence it was decided at the I. C.W. A. meeting last Tuesday that it mi^vt be advisable to have\nmatters of general interest reported in Felix.' It was thought, however, that the\npresence of Mr. Griffin himself would be\nquite superfluous, since the secretary of\n'Felix'is, in general; a member Of I. C.W. A. The meeting finally decided that nothing\nshould be reported without the previous\nconsent of the President.\nview po ii Anyone who suggests that w* eo\nrv oi of fB to set a degree and .a come\nto College to get a degree an*..fa.\nhave a bit of sport is really litt xe short of a public enemy. We come here to complete our education, to de velo o our personality and to acquire a little of what is freely ref eu ed to in FELIX as Kul ture.^ j Unfortunately I. C.lacks one of the most important attributes that a modern University Colleges nou ld have. Our College, whether we like it or not, is a rather one sided affair, ones i ded in academic subjects, one sided in the sex of its students and ones i ded in the attitude of its Union elite. As a college, we lack the properly Integrated balance of departments, staff, and students that we should have, and our social life reflects this. Perhaps it is not surprising that there is a growing number of here ties a tI.C. who wend there weary way to Bloomsbury for something better. Geographically you would not expect I.C. to be a very significant college in U.L. U. affairs, and from a Union government point of view it isn't, but anyone who has anything to do\nwith U.L. U, activities is staggered by the number of I.C. men who hold leading and influential positions in U.L. U. The best known of these was\nprobably Wally Goss whose work for the University Athletic Committee\nwill long be remembered. At present we have Brian Smith as VicePresident of U.L. U. and Social Chairman, a hard worker and a wonderful organizer, who\nwas driven away from I.C. by the coldness of the Union towards residents of Sil wood. Many will remember \"Danny\" Kale who was a founder-member of Sennet and\nthe second editor; Bill Hudson, who\nbuilt up the sales of Sennet from nothing to several thousand in two\nterms. Music lovers a tI.C. will be found a tU.L.U. by the score, players in the orchestra, singers in the choir and listeners in the Concert Society. A host of other Societies have felt the I.C. influence for years. It must be admitted that there are exception s.3o long as the I.C. first eight manages to lead the \" purple\" eight in the \"Mead\" we are unlikely to be represented in that boat, and\nthis applies to most other sports clubs._ But in sporting activities, the chief function of U.L.U.i s to organise i/i ter college sport, and in this r.C. does tolerably well. But we\ncould do a lot better by raising a little more University spirit. Only last week I.C. could have walked the\nUniversity Boxing Championships if more had entered. Two questions arise out of all this: firstly, should I.e. Union government\nhave a more active voice In U.L. U. affairs; and. secondly, is I.C. Union losing many of its best potential leaders by its restrictive attitude? The man who is after a real University education and a full social life will find the Union dice loaded against him, he will be swept aside as of no consequence, as the Union elite heralded by a shower of milk bottles topples on the edge of the abyss.

'London College Trophy' race, and came fourth to UC, Kings> \u00bbnd\nL&E. out of about a dozen teams.\nD.B rl gg s ran well to take4 th. place. On S at. Feb. 1 6 th., an A team lost narrowly to Brentwood School C.C.C. by\n3 4 pts. to47. C. Wood Is to be congratulated on a fairly easy win and recording a personal best time round our home;\ncourse.* On the same day three members of the Club were in the UL. te an which came\n2nd. to Cambridge in the ILA.U. CrossCountry Championships ove i7^ miles at Birmingham. They were .roh nii vans who came 1 0 th., John Collin,29 th., and Dave Br lg gs,34 th. On Wed.

Locke, K.W all, J. Collins, D. Br lg gs,C. Wood,\nand Dl Thomas.\nROWING On Wed. 1 3 th., Feb. the first f ou; eights of I. C.B.C. visited Reading TTniv ers it y. Conditions were such that the\nfloodwater made a fast running stream down the1^ mile course. The second eights raced first and at the start the LC. eight \"leapt into a1 length leadoff the tlrs tten str6 kes. With i^hl s psychological advantage the crew\nsettled down to a pleasant row keeping the Reading crew at a safe distance. The third eight racing next were\nnot troubled either by conditions or by their opponents, and won their race by an easy distance. However the first eight were faced by a crew of more\nequal standing. At Caversham Bridge the Reading crew were leading by a canvas. I.C. put in a spurt however and\ncrossed the finishing line level. The fourth eight in their maiden race pulled what seemed to be a lost race out of the bag and snatched a canvas\nwin after being^ length down 20 strokes from the finish. On S at.16 th. Feb, I. C.B.C. first two\neights visited Clare College Cambridge.\nThe second eight's went out first, the other oarsmen regaining on the bank\npushing bicycles. Rowing on the Cam\nwas a new and pleasant experience but the. LC. boat soon showed their pace.\nIn ami nature 'bumping race' the second eight soon caught and bumped the Clare second eight. In a4^ minute side by sl de race the LC. eight took a good\ntwo lengths from the home crew.\nThe first eight in their outing also had better pace than the Clare first boat. Although these two eights did not race in the true sense of the word, the IC. eight won amoral victory by keeping in front of the Clare boat and building up a lead. On F ri.22nd. Feb. the first t#o eights embarked on the annual Staines Trip. Leaving the Boat House, Putney at 2.30 they arrived at Lens bury Club, Teddington at 5.00 pm. having had a good row up through Richmond. The\ntrip continues and the crews row on\nto Staines on Saturday returning on\nSunday evening. Against Harlequins A XV. at Har ll ng ton LC. played a superior brand of open\nrugby to win by eight points to nil. In the first half IC. three quarters were continually pressing the visitors' line, and only a lack of finish pr even ted a number of tries being scored. Eventually^ Lanz threw himself over the line for a try following a loose maul\nand Stone converted. In the second half LC. pressed home their advantage\non the slippery pitch and Banks added\na try after a fine dribble up the field. Playing Sae ace n sEx.1 st. XV for the second time in a fortnight IC. again lost by an odd three points. The\nperformance on this occasion however,\nwas more notable when one considers that ID. lost Hearn playing at standoff after ten minutes, due to a leg Injury. The ground was reduced to a quagmire by drizzling re in through out the match and the conditions seemed\nto suit the Saracens' tactics better. Our opponents took the lead after five minutes with a penalty goal following an offside infringement round the sc rummage. After Hearn left the field, Stone de put is ed\" at standoff and playing seven forwards against eight the IC. pack acquitted itself very well. Just before the interval trie score was\nequalise d when Crozier touched down\nfor a try following a forward rush. In the second half IC. continued to keep a territorial advantage but the slippery ball prevented the ID. backs from taking the initiative Just before time a disappointing defensive lapse allowed the opposing halfbacks to scramble over for a try which was\nunc on verte d. The I. C.B XV who tookover the R. S.M.'s fixture a gal n. it ji xe ter College Oxford,1 st. XV are, o be cong ra tula ted on being\" defeat3 d by only11 points to5. Indeed the B XV. capt a in has been heard to state that a fairer score would have been Bot oI.C. though listeners are left in doubt as to ju,st how he arrived at\nthese Mg ure s. SOCCER We are now approaching the part of\nthe season when the final positions in the University Leagues will be de cid ed.\nAfter its first league defeat by UC.\nin the premier division, the1 st. XI has\ngone on to gain two convincing victories over Sir John Cass and Goldsmiths College. These victories were most\nencouraging, not only from the point of view of the goals scored, but also in the improvement of coordination within the team with wing halves Lead better and Judd providing a continual and\nintelligent link between defence and\nforwards. The 2nd. XI, with one league game\nto play, should win promotion to the\nfirst division from which they were\nrelegated last season. The 3 rd XI, already assured of promotion, play Woolwich Polytechnic on Wednesday; the result of this game may well decide whether they are champions or runner sup of division3. The preliminary rounds of the Inter College Technology Cup have been play ed. City and Guilds beat R \u00a3\u00a3. and R \u00a3)lv\nand R.C.S. beat R.S.

Several members\njumped the coach at Pen-y Gwryd to brave the elements in the Ll an be rl s Pass and\nSnowdon. The rest continued until the coach had to be abandoned about three miles from the hut where a sharp corner prevented any further progress.

EOT \\T ONLV FtLUS of HALF0*= IT,\nThe last meeting of Council took place\non February 11th. and lasted for about .\nhours. The following items of general\ninterest arose from the meeting.\nDates of Terms\nAt a previous meeting it had been decided\nto protest to the Hoard of Studies about the\nsudden changes' in term times which had\noccurred this session, causing considerable\nconfusion in the fixture arrangements of\nsome athletic clubs. The Board of Studies\nhas since produced a set system for fixing these dates which are now known for many\nyears ahead. It was noted with satisfaction that the Christmas term will not extend\n30 nearly to Christmas Day as it did this year, and Post Office work should be pass i ble without taking unofficial leave of absence.\nPosition of Senior Common Room in Union\nIt was unanimously agreed that the\npresent position of the 3.0.2'. is a definite hindrance and a deterrent to the full use of the building in its intended function as a students' Union. The S. C.R. in the old Union\nUnion had caused no trouble owing to its remote position at one end of the building.\nThe S. C.R. committee have accordingly been\nasked to consider moving the S. C.R, up to the\nsmall Lounge of the top floor. This would\nenable the present S. C.R. and Reading Room\nto be linked as a considerable increase\nin student lounge ac como dati on. The top\nfloor lounge is comparatively remote, and\nfar fewer students would need to use the\nroom as a right-of-way, owing to the existence of a lift, the S. C.R. would be easily\naccessible from the Dining Hall. It was\nalso pointed out that in view of the excellent\nS. C.R. in the Unwin Building, and the great\ndifference in3 taff and.stu u ent members, the\nS. C.R. committee might consider moving out\nof the Union altogether. Any member of\nstaff who wishes to is e the Union can do so\nby paying the subscription of three guineas.\nThere the matter rests until the next\nmeeting of the S.G.R. committee. ( It is, of course,realised that the ^resent S. C.R. would\ncontinue to be used for pre-Dinner sherry in the evenings, but there is no objection to that).\nJubilee Ball, Kay 31st,9p. m.6a.m. Four hundred double tickets, \u00a31 each,\nwill be on sale before the end of term.\nElaborate security measures will be employed to avoid gate-crashers. The relative merits of Club hops and Entertainments\nCommittee *ops were di cussed. The Chairman\nof Entertainments is to put forward proposals\nfor altering the Hopping to the next\nCouncil meeting, and the matter will be\nreferred to a Union meeting before being\nenforced.\nFurniture\nIt was agreed to press the college\nauthorities to furnish the entrance hall of the Unwin-but i ding as a lounge, for use\nby people who lunch in Ayrton Hall, and\nwho have nowhere to relax afterwards.\nThe lack of comfort and quality of the new lounge furniture gave rise to' considerable dismay, as the Union is financially responsible for its upkeep.\nThe President was asked to press the\nUnion Decoration Committee to devote part of its remaining funds to the purchase of strong and comfortable furniture for the lounge, the present chairs to be moved\nelsewhere.\nExploration Board\nThe Exploration Board reported that\narrangements were well under way for the\nit arak or am Expediter to take place this summer; the long-delayed permit to enter\nKashmir was expected soon. Places, to be\nvisited in the near future include\nthe Gold Coast and The Outer Hebrides;\nin any case, one major expedites would be\narranged every five years to encourage\nsmaller expeditions.\nNew Hostels\nIt was reported that plans far Princes Gardens were progressing as well and quickly as red tape would allow, but\nthe College wished the details to remain\nconfidential for the time being.\nCOMING EVENTS\nFriday.

    "content": "F \u00a3 LIX BERLIN VISIT1 WS COLUMN GATHERING OF WESTERN EUROPEAN STUDENTS\nA detailed account of every event in The International Meeting of students\nrepresenting university and national unions\nfrom Western Europe was organized^ as in the\npast, by The Teohnische Universitat, Berlin. There were no political, national or student,\nideas behind this meeting, only the exo hang e of contacts and ideas on life in other\nuniversities. Considering the economic and political position of West Berlin, an interest in the political situation was inevitable. The\nWest Berliners are very a on so io us of their position in the. Bast ''est relations and\nare eager that as many people as possible\nfrom a large range of activities and\ncountries should have the opportunity of becoming familiar with the unique city and\ncountry of it est Berlin. We stayed in a Red Cross Hostel in aS. Western suburb of the city with five students of the Aussenreferat, the Council\nof the Technische Universitat. English\nwas the official m eating language but I was somewhat dismayed to find with my\nmeagre knowledge of German,I was the\nonly Englishman there. The N.U.S. had\nnot even bothered to reply to the\ninvitation and made explanations somewhat I difficult. The programme that had been prepared\ns tru oka fine bala no e between the serious\nand the distinctly social. The day after we arrived we toured\nthe T.U., which had been destroyed\nduring the war and i3 now refitted with\nthe best equipment that the Germans can\nobtain. A first impression is one of\nquiet and space. Students move about\nquietly and although there are some\n6 0 0 0 students at the T.U., there is none of the noise that characterises the\ncorridors in I.C. Next day after a leo ture on the political situation in East Germany,\n( in German) we visited the finest equipped brewery in Europe with surely\nthe most generous management. The last in tell ige able comment heard was \"Well,\nsome Finnish student drank 31 of these\nbottles\". A tour of the Grtine Woche show,\nwhich is an agricultural exhibition in West Berlin, gave us our first g limos e of Eastern Berlin ars who were\nconspicuous with their infer i our o lot hess. and poor shoes. The Easterners are eager\nto keep up to date with progress in agri culture and this show gives them adequate\nopportunity\nLC. PHOTOGRAPHIC TRIUMPH The 2nd. Annual Photographic Exhibition was held in U.L. U. from February l821t th. The entry was both larger and better than last year,287 prints and l'+O colour slides were\nhung. Sponsored by the Daily Mirror,60% of the prize money was won by I.C members, rne Exhibition was opened by\nMr. A.L.M. Sowerby, President of the\nR.P.S. and Editor \u2022* the Amateur Photographer, who spoke of the high standard of the work. I.C, prize winners were: Port ral tur e.lst. A. J.E vc ott( P.G. Metallurgy);2 nd.A. Levy( P.G. Chem.Eng.)\nRecord. l st. B.R.F. Cook(3 Meoh.)\nColour.1s t.,2 nd.,3 rd. B.R.F. Cook.\nPictorial. Highly commended.\nF. Peacock( P.G. Chem.Eng.)\nThe work of Brian Cook was very highly praised, and his photographs of racing cars were particularly admired. Mr. C lyne, Art Editor of the Mirror showed particular interest in, Tony Ey cot t's portrait( l st.) of Elizabeth.' Tony Levy' s character study \u2022Anybody's Friend' of a woman of the street was excellent. It is hoped that all the prize winners will be hung at\" the I.C. Photographic Society' s own\nSx hi bit ion which is being opened on\nMonday by Mr .R.H. Mason,Art Editor of the \"Amateur Photographer.\"\nJ. K.T. the packed ten days in Berlin would be\ntedious and,for me,perhaps inadvisable,but\nmany visits such as one to the Refugee\nCamp can never be forgotten.

    "content": "FEL1313l F tTc S TO TH t EDITOR\nThe topic of Hall Dinner was raised several times last term,chiefly in connection\nwith block bookings, which were deplored by\nmany people as being contrary to the idea of Hall Dinner; * consequently, b look bookings\nwere prohibited, and prospective diners were\nlimited to one guest each. This term, the\npopularity of* Hall Dinner seems to have de-c lined, and attendances have been unusually\nlow; at the t it L me of going to press, even the\nWine Dinner on February 26th.is not fully booked up!\nHowever, it appears that even with small\nattendance, the attitude of some people to, Hall Dinner leaves much to be desired. At the\nDinner last week j two young ladies, in keeping\nwith the spirit of Hall Dinner, decided to place themselves next to people they did not\nknow, but from whom they would have the opportunity of gaining fresh ideas; for Hall Dinneri s primarily a social function - the excellent\ndinner is merely a delightful incidental. So\nthe ladies placed their cards in appropriate\npositions and retired to have sherry. On re turning after the dinner gong had been sounded,\nthey found that their cards had been moved,\nand that a party of eight were now seated im\nand around.the places. Throughout the evening\nthe group made no attempt to converse out si themselves. Apart from the bad manners of\nthese \"gentlemen1* in moving the cards without\nhaving asked the ladies, this cliquish attitude is entirely at varia no e with the Hall Dinner\nprinciple, w hio his to provide an opportunity\nfor staff and students and their guest e to meet on a soo i al footing, and a place where\none can meet people with whom one would not\nnormally come in too on tao t.\"v/ e wonder whether it was the same people;\nwho provoked the writing.of the letter pub li shed on this page.\nThe idea of stopping block\u00abbooking was\nthat socially-minded individuals should not\nbe excluded. Surely I.C. does not o on s is t of\nrecluses and cliques? The only way too b taira full University education is to mix with\npeople - the more people , the better and\nDinner in Hall provides an excellent\nopportunity \u00a3or this. Dear Sir,I was shocked to read in the last issue\nthat 'Felix' is actively encouraging the\ncultivation of unsightly fungus on our scientists. Let us please keep our sense of proportion and position. Such mystical rites belong over the \u00bb\u00abay in the H.C. A. Surely a far better idea would have\nbeen to have a beard shaving race with\ncut-throat razors.\nHowever,, I suB pose it is too late to it off now. Is it too much to hope\nthat, since jI. C.W. A. is having a show of\nmanliness,, we might have a 'Felix'\nbathing Vjeauty competition in the new\nfor our edification? call that,\nYours sincerely,\nD.F.

Standeven\nbear Sir, It is diff i ou lt to find any justification for the publication of the article in your last issue entitled Touchstone\nWeekends\"'. The few facts w hio hit contained\nhardly needed \"unearthing* sino e. they axe\npermanently displayed on almost every\nnotice board In the college. The rest ef the) article seemed to be a misrepresentation designed to encourage the\"sex-be ar-ap-o ort\" fraternity to invade Sil wood park and degrade one of I.C.'a few\ncivilised activities into* a PWsnlt! of\nthat curiously student mixture of the\nprimitive and the decadent.\nTours faithfully, WJ3. Statham\nEditor'a Note:\nLast week's article was an attempt to public_ se Touchstone in aquas j^ huni aura us manner. We j apologise if anything derogatory\nwas read into.the article j' certainly nothing derogatory was intended. BIt felt that if any \" sex-*e ers poo ort\"\nmorons are persuaded to- go.\" to Silwood Park,\nit will do them the world of good; Touchstone ie surely too j well established to. come\n> any nana.\nWHAT MB THE REASONS? WHO ABE RESPONSIBLE?.\nDear Sir, Critioisms upon crit io isms are piled in your\ncolumns against the new Union. I think that if the reasons for the most provocative features\nare given, then perhaps the volume of\ncomplaints will be suppressed.\nVery often a criticism of bad taste does not\narise if the underlying functional need is understood. For example,how many know that th t neurotic yellow in the tower Dining Hall was\nan idea in order to supplement the light that\ndoes not come through the small windows.\nTo my mind, three things may be happening;\n1. The designers of the new.building have lef tool leg e and are nowhere to be found.\n2. Nobody designed anything.\n3. The genii( or geniuses) responsible for the\nshape of things that came are either afraid or\noo ul d not o are to defend their designs.\nThis boils down to voices shouting in the\ndesert and it is quite pa the tio exo ep t of\ncourse if treated a3 a big joke.\nSo let those who have had a finger in, it defend their brightest ideas, as now, as in any\ncase, it is too late to do anything else.\nSuch explanations will make instructive reading and , if nothing else will change\nFelix' s appearance.\nYours Extraordinarily, B. Mantzouranis.

MJ S nter tain ment s Committee under911 Street had made\ngood several of the shortcomings of the first New Union Carnival held at the beginning of the term. The ' S in bin' J.n the middle of the Concert Hall floor certainly broke up the previous im persson al atmosphere and the displacement of one of the' sn ogg erie si by a convenient corner bar made drinking cosier. One noticeable improvement was in the dress; well over half those attending took the trouble to come in the appropriate apparel. Many colourful costumes were displayed in the' Regalia. Revue'; the prize went to a witch doctor whose complex headdress and make-up\nshowed great ingenuity. The appreciation of the cabaret,' Kr a a l\\a per s', depended to a large extent on\nthe audience's knowledge of those taking part. Doug Owen excelled as a delightful Fairy Queen and' Cork' Green acted naturally in the guise of a gorilla. Notman managed to add about the correct percentage of inebriation to the acts. Perhaps those not up to date with Union affairs and personalities did not enjoy it as much as those who were better informed. Some \u00a3100 worth of refreshments were consumed by the300 attending. Criticism might be levelled at the rather rushed painting of the flats, however the lack of art and anatomical knowledge might be excused in the Mines. The flats deposited a lurid green hue\nah all those who were foolish enough\nto lean on them.\nHowever, all in all the Mines deserve congratulations on a very successful carnival. How will the Engineers do?\n\n"
