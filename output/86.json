The ex-cell ent iron/ce mtn tite diagrams could be seen at\na glance showing with great clarity the sulphur\ninclusions precipitating along the grain boundaries.\nWe were told that the exploration of these regions\nwould cost up to \u00a3\u00a3,\u00a300 and support was hoped from\nscientific societ is.

Is this a word compounded by Dr. K. from 'conjugal'\nand 'enc ien te'?

    "content": "FELIX^ Sports News! SPORTS EDITORIAL\nIt would appear, from the paucity of back-page news,\nthat the Sports Editor will shortly be relegated to Sport Ed.\nEveryone is remarkably reticent concerning their athletic\nand allied defeats, and the Hockey Club, having lost three\neons e out ive games, flatly refused to appear in print at all. I.C. W.S.C., faced with the prospect of having a season\nfull of cancelled matches \"owing to inclemency of weather\",\nhave begun arranging \"ghost fixtures\" in which they pretend\nto wipe their opponents off the map. This is good for\nmorale and costs nothing in fares and broken sticks.\nWe hear that the Cross-Country Club are going en bloc\nto the Carnival. These gentlemen are fast off the mark and\nhave a very strong finish. Should the Carnival be\nhandicapped?\nGOLF\nThe Golfing Association is once more having a most\nsuccessful season. Having been undefeated last season\nthe team has so far had very convincing wins in the five\nmatches played to date, and is looking forward confide\nent ly to the remaining games to be played.\nMany beginners haws i \u00bb\nr of it j2d. from the series of group\nlessens which has been arranged with the professional at\nHighgate. Some have shown outstanding progress and will\nprobably do very well in the Captain1\na Cup k hook out competition where they can take full advantage of their handicap allowance.\nGolf is somewhat dormant at the moment, mo3t people\nbeing content with an odd game now and then to keep in pra c tice. Competitive events to be held later in the season\ninclude the Spring Meeting ('.Tentworth) on March 22nd, the\n'Weekend' (Cooden Beach) on April 20th22 nd and the Summer\nMeeting (Camberley Heath) on June 22nd. The'Annual Dinner\nwill be held on February 27th when it is hoped that some\npersonality of the golfing world will be present.\nFurther information concerning these events will be\ngiven at the General Meeting an February 2nd.( Committee\nRoom A.1.15 p.m.) SOCCER CLUB\nt f.I \u00bb Gup 2nd Hound v Goldsmiths' j f gn5^ For this match I.C. had to travel to meet Goldsmiths'\nCollege. About half of the team had been to the Guilds'\nCarnival the previous night, many players sti 11 showed signs\nof a hangover, and consequently there was some doubt about\nthe eventual result of this important game.\nHowever,I.C. played together very well in what was a very\nexciting game. At half-time Goldsmiths' held a31 lead, but\nI.C. fought back strongly and Gordon Green clinched matters\nin the last minute with a well-taken goal. I.C. now meet\nL.S.E. on February 15th in the semi-final of the cup.\nThe first XI have played only, two matches so far this\nterm. Westminster defeated us by 4 goals to 2 in a game\nWhere I.C. were definitely outplayed, although at the same\ntime it should be mentioned that Dennis Moore was injured\nin. the initial stages of the game and had to continue on the\nwing. This injury was mo3t unfortunate in that it is most\nunlikely that he will be fit for the Cup semi-final on February 15th. Although L.S.E., our opponents in this match,\nhave beaten us 5-1 in the League, it is felt that we have\na sporting chance of reaching the final King's trou no ed the L.S.E. team 5-1 t \u00bb\nvo week3 ago, and I.C. were unlucky\nto lose to King's by the only goal last week, when a def-la it e improvement was noticed in the side. We hope that\nall members Trill endeavour to support the team on Feb. 15th, and that with more fitness and sobriety in the side they\nwill give a good account of themselves.\nAlthough the A.C.C. do not provide a tour grant until\nnext year, it is hoped that a tour can be arranged in the\nforthcoming Easter vacation. We have already written to\nDelft concerning this but unfortunately no reply has yet\nbeen received. Those of the Club who had the pleasure of\nentertaining the Delft. Studenten Club da Bugby oa their recent visit will realise that a visit to Delft is.the obvious\nchoice for such a tour. Bbwever, the Secretary would be very\no leased to received any alternative suggestions.\nA letter has been received from Bsmptan b mur School\nthanking the 2nd. XI far the two enjoyable fixtures. It appears that all the school sides enjoy these fixtures as much\nis we do, and it is certainly a fitting way to prepare them\nfc r University sooner.\nI. C.W. A. on the Table\nThe I. C.W. A. Table Tennis Team played their first league\nmatch against Westfield's1st. three last Tuesday unfortunately the match was lost, 7-3, but Jennifer Haywood is to\nbe congratulated on winning two out of three of her games.\nThe doubles match resulted in an easy win for Westfield, due\npossibly to the fact that the I.C. pair have very limited\nopportunity far practice.\nLinks Trophy Award\nAt the x a st meeting of the Athletic Clubs\nCommittee the Links Memorial Trophy was awarded\nto the Swimming Club as being, in the Committee's opinion, the athletic club with the most Improved\nrecord during the past year.\nTo celebrate this, the 2nd team beat N.E.C.1 st team 5-2 at St. Mary's Hospital hath a eight\ndays ago.\nRUGBY CLUB\nPerhaps the first mention 3hould be the glorious\nlast week of the autumn term when the 1st. X7 beat NSC\n62-0, setting up an unofficial record and followed it by trouncing university vandals to the tune of 53-0,\nmaking a total of 115 pts. to nil in one week.\nSince then has been the Christmas vac. and a visit\nfrom Delft - already reported - , the result was that\na much too confident team went to Reading to play the\nuniversity. We were rather flattered by the result\nwinning 18-8. In much the same confident vein the team\nallowed!Kingjs to gain a half time lead of 3-0 at Jlitoham. Just as the forwards began to pull their weight\nPete Kale was injured and the last 25mins were contested\nwith only seven forwards. The rest of the game reflects\n^re at credit an the team for they several times almost\nscored and finally lost 8-0. The 2nd and A XV's both\nwan their games with Kings 3-0, 20-3, redeeming the situation slightly.\nThe next few weeks will show whether the lesson\nhas been learnt, for this terms fixtures are extremely\nhard.\nApologies to the C XV for the cancellations this\nterm but the answer lies in better and more consistent\nsupport for the lower sides.\nUAL) Championship\nOn Saturday, Feb. 11th( the day after the\nCarnival) the Universities Athletic Union Crosscountry Championships will be held on Wimbledon\nCommon. It is hoped that London will win this event, and that the individual winner will be\nEvans of I.C. Further details will be published later. FIRST TEAM FIXTURES\nSaturday 28th. January.\nRugger. v.

Those who are unfortunate\nenough to live in places where the local education\nauthorities hare not followed most in giving the\nhands one State-recommended grants,are eo a jil mining. There is a point that is not made as often as\nit should be en\nthis subject. In several places\nof my own know-ledge, a student\nreceiving a Local Education\nAuthority's grant gets the\nsame as, and\noften more than,\na student on a State Scholarship\nin similar circumstances. There appears\n. to be no point\nin working '.or and winning a State Scholarship if there is to be no reward. IT CERTAINLY IS NOT WORTH\nIT JUST FOR THE KUDOS.\nA friend of mine, motivated by curiosity, decided to partake of his lunch in the new U.L. U building.\nSe, and three friends.entered the citadel without\nthe new \"passports\" (like all good I.C. men, they\nscorn the idea) and first had to ask where the\ncloakroom was - there was no notice to direct them.\nHaving satisfied that objective they then wished to\nfind a toilet. There were again no directing signs\nand no one to help them. They exp lor td the maze of\npassages and eventually found the room (sic) in the\nnick of time. Weary tramping along endless passages\nand up endless stairs, aided adversely by \"helpful\"\nsuggestions, with no notices or 'signposts' to help\nt nem, brought them to the bar. It was closed, but no\nnotice on the door to say so. The distant sound of\nvoices led them along un signposted galleries to the\nrefectory where they found a queue. In order to get\nto the back of this queue they descended several\nflights of stairs. After an unannounced ten minutes\nthe refectory was declared open. They did not have to\nwait long, and my friend informs me that the meal\nwas a Jolly sight better than any available at I.C.I will forestall Ur. Alec Leaver, who is going\nto write to explain that the place is not yet completed and signs are shortly to be put up. THEY SHOULD\nHAVE BEEN THKKK WHEN THE BUILDING OPENED. U.L. U. should have spent the money on them which they wasted\non Union Cards WHICH ARE NO LONGER ASKED FOR.\nHOST OF US ENJOY THE \"GOON SHOW\". It provides\nthe best kind of comical relief from the scientific and the technological. That there should be many\npeople going round the college and the hostel imitating the voices of the characters in this programme does not reflect the high average intelligence\nof I.C. men and women. This imitation is not clever,\nanyone can do it. It, is not funny, so many people\nare doing it. IT IS THE TRANSFER OF THE SUBLIME TO\nTHE RIDICULOUS.\nA WORD OF PRAISE would not be amiss in this\ncolumn. Dipping my pen, therefore, into the treacle\ninstead of the vinegar, let praise be given to the\nImperial College Exploration Board. The college\nowes them gratitude for the sterling work that the j are doing on our behalf. I am sure that there will be many volunteers to assist in getting together\nand checking the various parties' kit and stores.\nUuch of the success of these expeditions will depend on the work put into the preparation for them.\nWe shall not let them down on that score\u2014 \u2022\ncolumn Correspondence^ be^es sea to\\'\nMil Shut, c/o The Secretary, Filial. In bed with 'flu',\nS.W.2. January 20th. Dear 3ir, Last friday, your Viewpoint writer who modestly styles\nhimself \"TFere Atkinson\", chose to attack the last editorial\nof Phoenix. I say \"o hose\" deliberately, for a slight examination reveals far more in favour of the article than other-wise. In fact, the ao tu al arguments against the editorial\nseem to me the weaknesses off a powerful piece of vindictive\nwriting.\nThe editorial states: \"the formation off any new c luk is now\" (i.e. THIS SESSION) \"opposed by the S. C.C. Executive\".\nViewpoint counters this by pointing to the formation! of the\nWine_Tastiag CLub \"barely six months ago\" (but LAST SESSION\nand before the present S. C.C. Executive was even elected l) Again Viewpoint speaks of \"flourishing'' sub-groups\nworking harmoniously for several years with their parent\nbodies. I had personal experience of the events leading up\nto the disintegration of the old Political Society into its\nsub-groups, and I can assure you relations were far fi rom harmonious.\n\"Hike Neale 3aid\",( with an air of authority bearing tb.\nhall-mark of a Cbunail meeting - or the Bar) that amalgamates of club was more in keeping with the University spirit,\nwell, if the S. C.C. can be taken as a cross-section, the\nresounding defeat they gave their Executive on the subject\nwould seem to belie the statement, Incidentally, I have the\npersonal assurance of the Chairman of the S. C.C. that even he\nwas uninformed of these interesting sentiments of a former\nPresident of I.C.I am sorry I cannot reply more fully to Viewpoint than\nthis but unfortunately I have been laid up all week and have\nbean unable to get a copy of Eelix.

Various doubts as\nto the pro b obili ty of this had been expressed\nby some members of the student body, especially when it was learned that the small windows facing the Albert Hall were to be enlarged. People\nwho have seen these from the inside will realise that the Sectors in sistance upon this matter was\njustified, but the fact that they had been built this way was an unfortunate error on the part of\na civil engineer. He had not detected the weak\noriginal wall containing these windows, and they\nwere to have been left in originally to save\nex pence and time. Council told the Rector that\nthey didn't want the windows enlarged if it was\ngoing to be used as an excuse for not completing\nthe building on schedule. To ensure this, it has\nbeen arranged that the bricklayers whose job will be shortly completed on the main wall section will be transferred to this new task.\nThe frame work of the building should be\nfinished shortly, but it is feared that the severe\nweather may be used as an excuse for invalidating\nthe penalty clause. Full advantage was not taken\nof the excellent November weather which gave a great spurt of progress to the Roderick Hill building.\nIS IT PROGRESSING?\nEASTER RUGGER TOURS\nThe City and Guilds College Union have made a grant of \u00a350 towards a rug ger tour of Holland\nduring the vacation. This is on condition that\nfifteen Guildsmen play at least two matches under\ntheir College name. This comes as a reply to the\nRoyal College of Science Union's grant of \u00a350\ntowards a combined tour of Holland in which they\nanticipate* up to ten of their members participating. The Royal School of Mines will have their usual fixtures in Cornwall this Easter.\nA little calculation will show that engineers\nwill recieve \u00a33-6-8 towards their expenses, while\nscientists will recieve at least \u00a35-0-0 each.\nThis may not be a true reflection of the value of\nthese commodities, but it suggests that some of\nour local grant-giving authorities are not conforming with the opinions expressed at the last\nI.C. Union meeting.\nREFECTORY LOSSES\nMr Mooney has found that his losses in running\nthe Refectory are not confined to straight forward\nadministration losses, but that they also include\nthe disappearance of some of his equipment.\nBesides the small glasses and tea spoons that\nhave obviously been misplaced recently, it was\nfound that a large copper electric milk urn was\nmissing from the snack bar last Monday morning.\nThe security officer is hot on the trail, and\nhopes to have retrieved it shortly.He thinks it might well have been unofficially borrowed during\nthe weekend, but the possibility of outside theft\nis not excluded.\nI.C. UNION MEETINGS TO BE IN R.C.S. As a result of the damage done to the large\nlecture theatre in the City and Guilds College at\nthe last I.C. Union general meeting, the Dear of\nthe College, Professor Saunders has forbidden any\nmore I.C. meetings there. He will however allow\nthe City and Guilds to have a Union meeting there\nthis term, and future meetings will depend upon\nthe behaviour at this meeting.\nWW ORE AMIN LECTURES?

    "content": "FELIX3 Felix The Imperial College Newspaper\nCirculation1200 tdl tor: BILL HUBSOM\nLectures on topic* of general Interest were\nfirst introduced into the College in1946, bat it was not until Oct. 1952, that 'General Studies',\nlunch-hour lectures twice weekly, were started.\nThe purpose of these lectures is to provide students with help in shaping their own culture, and\nto provide a liberal education.\nThe need in this College for the 'General\nStudies' lectures cannot be overestimated. Owing\nto early special is ation in highly technical sub-j ect s, the average student tends to have a( some-what narrow outlook. The Fifth Annual Report of\nthe Scientific Advisory Council stated: \"A scientist whose training has been broadly based can\nquickly learn other specialities. The narrow\nscientist is rarely able to step outside the confines of his own particular interests.\"\nHow have these lectures been recieved by the\nstudents? Statistics on the weekly attendance over\nthe past four years makes interesting reading.\nDuring 1952-54 attendance was high, but there has\nbeen a noted lack of interest shown during the past\ntwo years. Is this due to the apathy of I.C. students or to the lack of appeal of the lectures? The\nformer seems to be the case as the lectures have\nbeen of diverse interest, the topics ranging, from\nFlemish Paintings to Anthropology, and the speakers\nhave been men of authority in their particular field, One reason for the dwindling in attendance\nat 'General Studies' could attributed to the\nincrease in activities of many Social Clubs, which\nnow hold meetings during the lunch-hours; this can\nhowever, only be a minor factor. The main reason is probably the ju veni lit y of the average I.C. student\nwho has not yet ne ached the age of attending lectures provided by the College Authorities for his\nown benefit, voluntarily. 'General Studies'\nlectures play an important part in a university education.\nDo students come to I.C. to'obtain a university education in the full sense of the term,\nor to be trained as technicians having no other\ninterests apart from their own subject? The\nlatter type of student can only be deplored,\nparticularly as they are given every opportunity\nto obtain a general education.\nMel Colt e is on*^o j um nI apologias for my part in mis-s pe fling the\nreport on the Union Meeting discussion on discrepancies in gran vs. It is too easy to drop a letter. Reporting a court case in New Zealand, the \"News\nof the World\" states that the 19 year old leader\nof a series of orgies was sent e need \"to be sent to a corrective institution for minors for3 years.\nLet's hope he arrives oe fore the Carnival.\nThere seems to be a large quantity of straw\ntrailing into the new Aero Block. We hope they are\nstudying the possibilities of Pegasus stalling because the only other person who could be interested\nin horses is Mooney.\nFor those who do not already know this, lost\nproperty may often be retrieved from Mrs. Robinson\nat the Union Office. Mr. Henry (179 Queen's Gate)\nis waiting for the owner of quite a nice raincoat\nto turn up and claim it. The author of the college wine list need\nnot ha we contradicted himself about burgundy god n.., with oysters. Who around here is interested in having oysters for dinner.\nSTUDENTS IN THE NEWS: Reynolds News reports\nthe following profound comments from a London\"\nUniversity engineering student at the Humphrey\nLyttlieton Club:- \"Humph is the tops. I can't explain\nit but his music gets under my skin and I just\nhave to do something. It kind a gets into you.see?\"\nAn ear iy19 th century map of*this area\nshows that the only building on;\nthe n resent site of the college was a workhouse where the admin-is t ration offices now stand \u2014what did they\nuse to do with their Christmas puddings? - \u2014\nand what can they possibly do with college\ncalendars which are left over?\nA certain I.C. lecturer,who left his lun cn on the train*a an aged to retrieve it \"from the\nlost property office to eat it at the usual time.\nWe would be Interested to hear of any student who\nboycotts the college refectory with such savage\nfer v our.
