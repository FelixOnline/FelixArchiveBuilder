    "content": "22 LETTERS & EDITORIAL FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND MAY Letters to Felix\nCaldwell's Big Top\nDear Felix,\nLast Friday I received a reconstituted wood-pulp information carrier\nthrough my in-door external communications interface, bringing to my\nattention the fact that my examinations have been 'relocated to a rigid-structured temporary marquee on\nPrince's Gardens'. By the way, we're\ndoing our exams in a tent this year.\nThis is all part of the forthcoming\nExam Fest '97, an open-air event\nwhich combines demanding exam\npapers vital to one's future success\nwith the chance to see some of the\nbest live bands in Britain. As well as\ngreat music there will be a motorcycle rally and free helicopter rides\nover the Prince's Gardens area. The\nexam tent will be pitched midway\nbetween the beer tent and the public\nlatrine, thus providing participants\nwith all the facilities they are likely to\nneed between events. Sales of illicit\ndrugs will not be a problem, as there\nwill be a substantial police presence\non site, who will also be on hand to\narrest anyone suspected of attempting to score 40% or more on a paper.\nIf all goes well, this will be the\npublic relations coup of the decade\nfor IC pic, who will then be able to\nput into action the next exciting\nphase of their master plan to create a streamlined and cost-effective organisation ready to proceed into the next\nmillennium. Draft proposals include\nthe renting of 'semi-permanent\nweatherproof teaching blocks in\ngreen-belt locations' (a couple of old\nmobile classrooms on some playing\nfields near Slough) for lectures, and\nthe provision of 'portable canvas-based accommodation units' for stu-dents.\nMeanwhile the substantial savings\ngenerated by no longer having to use\nvaluable college space on un profitably educating students will be reinvested in the refurbishment of the\nnew South Kensington Conference\nCentre. This will also allow the college to hire a professional\nEuphemisms Officer to aid communication with students.\nBy the way, good luck with your\nexams everybody!\nJames Clarke (Physics II)\nOther suggestions for (better) uses\nfor the tent include Scout camps,\ncomplete with camp-fires and\nKum Ba Ya, a touring production\nof the Nicaraguan State Circus,\nnightly productions of Barry\nManilow's latest musical,\nReferendum Party rallies\nDear all..\nI read with satisfaction the article\nin Felix this morning (and was\npleased to see my letter printed at the\nback). Although in fairness to the\ncollege, the marquee is very impressive and must have been very expensive to hire (although obviously\ncheaper than stopping building work\nfor a few weeks). The walls seem\nsolid and they don't blow in with the\nwind, but the roof is still made from\nsome sort of material, so I hope it\nisn't raining on the day of my exams\nor the noise will be very off putting. But I would like to make it clear\nthat I have not changed my tune. I am\nstill annoyed at the handling of this.\nAnd I would like to thank the registry\nfor the notification I received this\nmorning (dated 22 April) of the\nchange of examination venue for\nMonday. By voicing my displeasure,\nI do not aim to incite bad feeling\nbetween the student body and the\ncollege - I strongly believe that such\nfeelings are counterproductive for\nboth parties. I just see no other way\nto make the college see that its students are unhappy with the lack of\nimportance assigned to them.\nHowever, I am aware that Imperial\nCollege is primarily a research institution, in receipt of an extremely\nlarge proportion of the Higher\nEducation Funding Council's research budget. So maybe in the\nfuture there will be a move to convert\nto a post grad only institution.\nBut at the moment, undergraduate\nstudents do exist at IC and it would\nbe very nice if we could feel that we\nwere an important part of the college,\nalthough with the general lack of evidence of this it is far to easy to\nbecome cynical.\nWhile I am in the mood to continue in this somewhat political tone, I shall now outline my own considered\nopinion on how changes should be\nmade I believe that what the academics here really want to do is to get\non with their research. And so they\nshould. After all, research is extremely important. But to inconvenience\nthem, there's a load of students who\nturn up from various places around\nthe world demanding knowledge.\nBut (for undergraduates, certainly)\nthey want the academics to explain\nstuff which is fairly \"old hat\" to\nthem. It's boring - the academics\ndon't want to be wasting their time\nexplaining in simple terms the principles and ideas which they learnt\nyears ago. So what's the solution?\nWell, my idea would be to employ\nanother level of staff - a layer of\ntrained educators. People whose sole\npurpose within the college would be\nto educate the incoming students.\nThese people would have to be\nprofessionally trained as teachers, so\na certain level of teaching ability and\neffective presentation al techniques\nwould be more commonplace and the\nowners of the brilliant academic\nminds of Imperial College (and\neverywhere else) would be able to\ndevote themselves to the pursuit of\nfurther knowledge.\nAnyway, if you've read this far,\nthanks a lot. I must now leave and\nfurther my knowledge of Chemistry\nfor my exams.\nRegards,\nJon Walmsley {Chem II)\nDear Felix,\nI have just left my first exam,\nwhich was in the tent in Princes\nGardens and I would have to say that\nit is the noisiest place I have ever had\nto sit an exam, it is even noisier than\nthe hall in which 1 had to sit A level\nmocks where an extension was being\nbuilt just the other side of a wooden\npartition! I would appreciate you\npassing on my comments to whoever\nit may concern in Sherfield.\nP.A. Hickman (Chem II)\nDear Alex,\nI found out about the marquee the\nsame way most people did, on Friday\nmorning. I would like to add some\nthoughts to Jon Walmsleys excellent\nletter in the last edition of 'Felix'. I only scanned the letter as I was busy\nphoning registry to ask the Assistant\nRegistrar (Exams) if this was a bizarre practical joke. I did not at first\nread the section where college says\nthat they will be sending copies to\npeoples home addresses.\nMy parents were, to say the least,\nless than impressed. My dad is an\nacademic and I imagine many other\nstudents have parents in the 'trade' so\nto speak. If my dad's reaction is anything to judge by, Imperial College\nare about to become the laughing\nstock of the higher education sector.\nThis is not something any member of\ncollege should take pleasure in, internal disputes notwithstanding.\nOther Universities apparently consider exam periods when planning\nbuilding work and arrange years in\nadvance to avoid these kind of problems. I do not believe that the estates\ndepartment did not realise exams\nwould be taking place during the\nlibrary work. The only conclusion I can draw is that a decision was taken\nsomewhere in Sherfield, without\nconsultation (surprise, surprise), that\nthe building work is more important\nthan the welfare of students. If this is\nthe Imperial College position, fair\nenough, but I feel that this should be\nmade clear, perhaps in the pro spec tus....\nFinally I am led to believe that one\ncan appeal against ones exam results\nthrough the University of London\nand that 'mal administration'[ of the\nexams] is acceptable grounds...\nJohn Durrell (Physics IV)\nThe problem with the whole situation is that we all know that College\ndidn't choose the tent as the best\nsolution to the problem, rather this\nwas simply their only way out of a horrendously embarrassing and\nexpensive mistake. To protect their\nreputations and a huge amount of\nCollege money, they chose to pass\nthe problem on to us, the students.\nNow that the tent is in position, all\nthat we can do is to ensure that\nCollege in vigil la tors record all\nproblems (excessive noise, aller-gies, adverse weather conditions ) as they arise, and are\nforced to take them into account -otherwise they will lay themselves\nopen to the charge of\n\"Maladministration\", as Mr Durrell suggests.\nChange of emphasis\nDear Felix,\nThe response of your two main\ncolumnists to my letter at the end of\nlast term, regarding Felix's political\nbias, speaks volumes as to the size of\ntheir respective egos. Hamish\nCommon took the honourable\napproach, by exhorting students to\nvote, no matter whom they favoured.\nWhile spending considerable\namounts of his column talking about\nhimself, he at least accepted the idea\nthat neutrality was a virtuous concept\nfor the only universal student newspaper of Imperial College.\nMr Simon Baker however is\nanother matter, unilaterally deciding\nto abandon the long held reputation\nof Felix as the unbiased voice of IC\nstudents. His assertion that the political leanings of the student newspaper\nis set by its editorial is naive and\ndeliberately ignorant.\nEven when editorials are a regular\npart of a publication, its columns\nalways make a significant contribution to the tone of the newspaper -and attempting to suggest otherwise\nis avoidance of reality. With the relative dearth of editorials in this year's Felix, columns contribute even more\nto the journal's perceived prejudices.\nIt was with great sadness that I "

In\nthe background, you can hear\na succession of increasingly\nhysterical answering machine\nmessages. As if that wasn't confusing enough, it is then\nreplaced by an interrogation.\nWell, more like a segment of\nthe interviewee's life: he just\nkneels there while his interrogators never stop talking.\nAnd then that's replaced by a group of writers discussing a play.\nAt first, \"Attempts on her\nLife\" appears to be a collection\nof irrelevant, bizarre and\nunconnected scenes. There's a music video, a car advert (in\ntwo languages simultaneously) and a lengthy monologue\nby a cripple, to name but three. Individually a little\nSrrtM\n1085/1\nstrange, when put together, they begin to make no sense\nat all. The name \"Annie\" is mentioned a couple of times,\nbut you have no idea of who this \"Annie\" person actually\nis.\nBut this is just what makes the play look so astoundingly well done. After a while, things begin to come together.\nAlthough she never actually\nappears, you get a good idea\nof the kind of person Annie is,\nwhat she's done with her life\nand exactly what all the fuss is\nabout. That really odd scene\nhalf an hour ago begins to\nmake perfect sense and you\nrealise how it fits into the big\npicture and adds a great deal\nto it.\nHaving said that, not everything fits in perfectly. One\nscene keeps cutting to a man\nhaloed in green light reading\nout a list of seemingly random\nwords, then back to the main\naction of a group of art critics.\nIt just seems to distract from\nthe main scene without\nadding anything to it.\nOnce you get to the end,\neverything is crystal clear. But\nthen when you think about it\nsome more, it still doesn't make total sense. It's certainly\nopen to interpretation in a number of places. Overall, it's one amazingly well written play. Andy Royal\nWent Down to the Crossroads\nli y PhiliP GOUldinO It seems that each time I go to the theatre,\nthe audience moves closer to the stage and\nvice-versa...\nThe Courtyard is situated as its name suggests; it\nis a tiny theatre in a small country-like house. Although in\nthe 'not-so-dod gy' part of King's Cross, as it faces the side\nof the station, it is nevertheless stuck between a garish\nand uninviting fast food outlet and an abandoned looking\nhouse. Heaps of litter lay strewn about the pavement here\nand there and one would not really venture alone at night\ntoo much further up the street...\nI know that the purpose of a review is really to discuss\nthe performance but its rather unusual setting deserves a little more than just a passing mention and contributes a lotto the atmosphere and personal impressions of this\nintimate little theatre.\nThere was nothing really striking in the play itself.\nAn ordinary young man, Davy, a little idle, but without a precedence of delinquency, goes down to the crossroads\nnot very far from his home and shoots at random eight\npeople passing by, in less than two hours.\nThe search for him, his capture and consequent imprisonment are in fact subordinate. What the author puts the\nemphasis on is the 'psychological penetration' of the murderer ; what the motivations behind the massacre were,\nwhat his current feelings are, etc. The scenes follow\nseamless ly one upon the other, given a framework by the\nart and theatre ver present jour-na list, who does-n't represent the\ntabloids however,\nbut questions Davy's relatives and members of the neighbouring community.\nThe play revolves around the one question: WHY?\nI still cannot clearly see the purpose of writing such a play. Maybe it is that everyday, everywhere, we watch,\nhear or read about slaughter, ignominious events, but\nthey remain remote and do not touch upon our lives.\nHowever, they can happen in the 'real' world, in our 'nor-mal' world too. In my opinion, this pseudo-psycho-an aly sis of the murderer is rather pointless. It is developed by\nmeans of everlasting interrogations, of himself, his mother\n- 'how could my son have done this?' -, the girlfriend (with\nwhom there is a relatively 'hot' scene, by the way) - 'he\nwas such a nice boy' -, of the farmer, etc... who express\ntheir dismay and in comprehension towards the event. It is\nnot a question of hiding from a reality which, sadly, does\nexist, it is only that I feel it unnecessary to act out current\nevents or events that have, most unfortunately, more than\nonce made the news headlines on stage. If one wants to\ndenounce this kind of violence, which I am not sure was\nthe prime aim of the play anyway, one should approach\nthe subject from a different angle.\nThere is definitely something that disturbs me both with\nthe choice of theme and the way it has been dealt with.\nFinally, it has to be said that there was nothing outstanding in the acting, although Darren Charlton, as Davy,\ndid fit really quite well in his part.

    "content": "20 COLUMNS FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND MAY The Alternative Candidate\nLeave blatant bias for the national press. This week Ashton McGregor responds\nto Simon Baker, and explains why it's \"New Labour, No Danger\"\nSimon Baker is one of Felix's more\nentertaining writers. Here is a man\nwho arouses the most amazing passions in me. Fascist he is not, but he\nIS Harry Enfield's( the \"Bollinger\nBolshevik\") poor misguided Tory\nBoy.\nContrary to Mr Baker's economy\nboasts, the latest OECD study shows\nour country's relative decline in prosperity and an 8 per cent fall in manufacturing investment last year. We\nhave some of the worst living standards in Europe. The Tories have\nmade improvements in some aspects\nof micro-economic policy but these\nworrying findings alert us to the fact\nof their poor macro-economic management and a failure to tackle the\nalarming education and skills gap\nwith our competitors.\nWe are surfacing from one of the\nworst recessions in our history, and\non the brink of another dangerous\nTory boom and bust. Growth is heavily consumer-led, a phenomenon\ndescribed by economists as unstable\nand unsustainable. They would prefer an investment-led recovery, with\ncompanies re-investing in this co un try. The UK is the only country\nwhose expenditure on research as a proportion of its GDP has not\nincreased since 1979. The party that\nclaims to be the party of low taxation\nhas actually increased the overall\nburden of taxation.\nThe Tories trumpet their low\nunemployment figures as a huge success yet a report by the LSE revealed\nthat 20 per cent of households do not\nhave anyone who is working. Since\n1979 they have reclassified the term\n\"unemployed\" no less than 32 times.\nNow, unemployment benefit is\ndenied to all 16 and 17 year olds and\nthose in temporary work or training\nare not included. In 1979, there were\njust over 1 million people that were\njobless. The Unemployment Unit\nrecently calculated that 28 per cent of\nthe working population in Britain are\nunemployed and there is a now real\ndemand for 5.4 million jobs.\nMr Baker's assertions that the minimum wage and Social Chapter\nwould be damaging to Britain are so\nmisinformed that he would be perfectly at home on the Tory front\nbench. The CBI and TUC support\nboth measures. Intellectual argument\nand academic opinion is swinging\nbehind the minimum wage. Two\nleading US labour economists have\nconcluded that if not set too high,\nminimum wages have positive\neffects on employment raising the\nsupply of labour and therefore productivity and profits, while the\nopportunity to extract profits, by lowering wages and employment will\ndisappear. Due to changes in the\nlabour market, such as more flexible\ncontracts, less collective bargaining\nand more performance-related pay,\nas well as company reorganisation s, employees are unlikely to mind about\ndifferentials and would adapt to the\nintroduction of minimum payments\nfor their lower-paid colleagues. The\nEmployment Policy Institute argues\nthat the Treasury would also benefit\nfrom a minimum wage. For example,\na modest minimum wage of \u00a33.40\nwould have helped the Treasury to at unc of \u00a31.2 billion in 1995-96. The\nnational minimum wage must be\nseen as part of a wider \"welfare to\nwork\" strategy involving changes in\nbenefit so the low paid are removed\nfrom the poverty trap. Under Labour,\n\"the minimum wage will be introduced in a way which promotes the\ncompetitiveness of business and\nensures fair competition\". The decision on the level of of the minimum\nwage will involve significant representation from members of the business community and unions.\nAccording to the National Institute\nof Economic and Social Research,\nBritain has been overtaken by France\nas the prime European destination for\ninward investment. The biggest slice\nof the investment in France - heavily\nregulated, high cost France, the country that John Major denounced last\nweek - comes from Britain. British\nfirms, such as Tesco, Kingfisher, ICI\nand G KN have been investing in\nFrance since 1990, despite the fact\nthat the country operates a minimum\nwage and adheres to the Social\nChapter. While the UK has been\nquite successful in attracting labour-intensive projects, it has lost out over\nmoney to start businesses heavily\ndependent on capital and R+D. In\nfact it is EU membership itself - not\nthe UK' s flexible labour market\nalone - that has made the UK a prime\nnation in Europe for inward invest-ment. Anything - including standing\naside from EMU which puts that in\njeopardy could cost the country in\nterms of lost jobs, new productive\ncapacity and innovation.\nAnnouncements by companies such\nas Toyota and Unigate confirm this.\nIt has taken almost two decades for\nthe adjectives \"divided, incoherent,\nreckless and spendthrift\" to adhere to\nthe Conservatives rather than to\nLabour. Recently, several prominent\nbusinessmen stated that \"Britain cannot afford another five years of weak\nand ineffectual leadership....a New\nLabour government is essential to\nour future prosperity\".\nFar from being radical, the Tories\nare sticking to their old chestnut -public bad, private good. There are of\ncourse privatisation successes, but\nthere have been huge disasters. The\nelectricity, gas and water companies\nexist in a pseudo-competitive environment, with no real choice for the\nconsumer. The rail companies are\nexisting on subsidies by taxpayers\nthat have doubled since privatisation,\nwhilst providing worse service.\nLabour has learnt to acknowledge\nthat not everything that the Tories\nhave done should be reversed but that\ncannot conceal the scale of recon-struct ion. For me there is a gulf of\ndifference between the two parties. It\nis the distance between Blair's statement that \"we achieve more together\nthan we do alone\" and Baroness\nThatcher's enduring credo: \"There's no such thing as society.\" Her legacy\nhas been to leave in her party a determination to rid us of our faith in any\nsort of collective society. We have all\nbecome infected with the virus of\nThatcherism, and now any social\nactivity is suspect if its end result\ncannot be quantified. The views of\nnew Labour are the same as that of\nKier Hardie or Clement Atlee, but we\nlive in a completely different world\nto then. \"Labour tragically became\nstuck with the same policies while\nsociety moved on. We got ourselves\ninto a situation where we no longer\nseemed to be a party of aspiration.\"\nLabour appeared to represent those\nwho were poor and unemployed and\nrightly so, but the party has recognised that it must champion the\nwhole nation. The Tories believe\n\"there is no such thing as a one nation\nTory\". They are dinosaurs - politicians wishing to run the world as they\nwould like it to be, rather than it is.\nThat is why yesterday I voted for a party led by man who believes we\nachieve much more together than we\ndo alone.\nMr Baker will undoubtedly refer\nto me as a clich ed, naive, idealistic\nairhead so please allow me to get my\ninsult in first - SIMON BAKER IS\nMAD MAGGIE' S FILTHY\nSPAWN, so there!\nThe Weekly Poem\nsupplied by Toe tIC One\nLike one lost soul,\nIn a world of \"you and me\",\nI am the one that let you go,\nI am the love that's been set free.\nI am a flower in a bed of snow,\nI am a ship that's lost at sea,\nWill I ever see the shore again,\nAnd will someone rescue me?\n--Sarah- -PoetIC is the creative writing society of Imperial College,\nand is always happy to greet new members.

Suspicious,\nHera, Zeus' wife, asked for it as a present and, as soon\nas the unfortunate heifer was in her possession, she\nentrusted it to the care of Argos, the giant with a hundred\neyes that never slept at the same time. However, Zeus\nasked his son Hermes, protector of thieves, to steal her\naway. He lulled Argos to sleep with his pipes and killed\nhim. Hera was very upset. In remembrance of Argos, she\nput one of his eyes in a peacock's tail and in revenge she\nsent a gadfly to torment lo. She fled throughout the world\nuntil she was finally released from her torment in Egypt.\nElizabeth's second series has been named \" Of\nDreams, Lovers and Ancient Myths\" which is the result of\na new idea of a painting on steel. She has chosen to work\nwith metallic, iridescent paint, in order to achieve a\" surreal colour quality\", as well as aiming at creating a \"ten-sion between glossy paint and rust\".\nElizabeth's other works have a number of inspirational\nsources which include mythology again, but also,\namongst others, archaeology, the encounter of conscious\nand subconscious, in her most abstract canvasses and\nher extensive travelling.\nAmongst my favourites, is the series of Cat Women, with\nits near-to Baudelairean evocations. The artist has indeed\nbeen inspired by the cat as a symbol of femininity but also\nas a nocturnal animal. She seems somewhat fascinated\nby the mysticism and the occult symbolism which surrounds this individualistic feline. She reveals that in her\ndreams she has been a cat, that she has been painting\nherself as a sort of imaginary cat and that it is as this animal that she would wish to be reincarnated.\nAnd indeed, her cat women always have a particular\nhairdo - long, curly red hair - strangely reminiscent of\nsomeone, until we realise that it is in fact that of the tall\nSlavic artist...\nElizabeth, always cheerful and lively and whose enthusiasm cannot but quickly be reflected on whoever gets to\nknow her, will be exhibiting at the Ashford Library lend of\nJune), Place des Vosges, in Paris and at Nieborow, in\nPoland (September 97).\nDanuta\njuxtaposed\nPolish Cultural Institute\n34 Portland Place\nuntil 30th April\nMon-Fri 10-4\nexcept Thur 10 -8\nOiscovering the Italian Baroque\nAlthough the exhibition is entitled Discovering the Italian\nBaroque I feel that perhaps it ought to be named\nRediscovering the Italian Baroque. In the\neighteenth century, Baroque art was all\nthe rage with the British aristocracy who\nadmired and attempted with more or\nless success to imitate the s a voir faire of\nsuch artists as Guercino, Guido Reni,\nDomenichino, Luca Giordano, Pietro da\nCortona and Johann Liss. However this\nflamboyant style fell out of favour in the\nnineteenth century and has only recently\nexperienced a revival.\nIndeed the very first thing that strikes\nyou as you enter the exhibition is the\nrichness of the colours. You can almost\nfeel the different textures be they wool,\nvelvet, silk or even skin. This visual saturation is at complete odds with the functional, minimalist, pared-down style that\nmost post-war painters seem to favour\nand that you find in trendy, up-market\npied-a terre s, restaurants... Perhaps the\nrenewed interest in the Baroque is a backlash against the drabness and\nsterility of modern art.\nThe subject matter is usually drawn from the Bible of\nThe National Gallery\nTrafalgar Square\nuntil 18th May\nMon to Sat Warn - 6pm Wed Warn \u2022 8pm Sun 12pm6 pm Entrance is free.\nEnquiries:\n0171 7472885\nfrom Greek and Roman mythology. Herein lies one NatlOflSl G91161* V of the greatest paradoxes of the Baroque: sacred,\nreligious scenes and sacrilegious, profane scenes painted with equal fer v our and dedication, the Holy Family with the\nVirgin Teaching the Child the Read\nalongside the Mythological Landscape\nwith Nymphs and Satyrs. The same contrast can be found in the artists them-selves: while creating work of incredible\ndelicacy, they often led violent lives,\nSchedoni dying young in mysterious circumstances. I am particularly in awe of the way\nthey handle light and shadows, bringing\ntheir work to life in a way that no modern artist creating two-dimensional\npaintings can. I know that photography\nhas to some extent taken over the role\nthat Baroque painters occupied, but\nthere is still a lot of scope for modern\nartists to explore. The Baroque period is\na period of contrasts, between light and\nshadows, the Bible and Greek myth o lo gy, peacefulness and violence. This\nexhibition brings out the richness and the paradoxes of\nthis time. Emma\nart and theatre\n\n"

    "content": "Videos to Buy There have been numerous versions of Les Miserables, Victor\nHugo's nineteenth century mas-ter piece, but this interpretation\nreally stands out from the rest.\nThe film follows the life of a simple Frenchman during the\nSecond World War as he struggles to rise from the criminal\ndesperation into which he has been forced. His struggle\nbetween good and evil mirrors that which faced Hugo's original hero, Jean Valjean. As the film develops, each\ncharacter finds himself in a situation similar to somebody\nin the original book. This is cleverly directed and means\nthat although the film is long at over two hours there is\nalways some interesting theme developing. Even for\nthose who find subtitles a distraction the acting of the\nlead is notably believable, and along with the script and\npicturesque landscape this creates a memorable, high-quality film.\nV, the 1980s sci-fi series with\naliens arriving in huge flying\nsaucers intent on eating humans,\nI was never shown in full on UK TV\ndue to the 1984 LA Olympics.\nNow, 13 years later, is a chance\nto buy the series and see if the\nResistance ever managed to rid\nthe world of the \"visitors\"...\nEpisode 6 - The Dissident\nAlien leader Diana plans to\ncreate a force field around Los Angeles so the Resistance\nmust spring into action once again. The only plot development in this episode concerns the ongoing love triangle\nbetween Kyle, star-child Elizabeth and her mother.\nOtherwise it's all a bit tame with special effects which\nwere great in 1984 but now look dated.\nEpisode 7 - Visitor's Choice\nThe alien visitors have invented the ultimate human-processing device and there's problems for rebel Kyle,\nwho is captured and tortured by his own father. Again,\nthe plot is moving along very slowly with too much\nemphasis on action scenes and not enough on the\nResistance's plans to permanently defeat the Visitors.\nThe Birdcage tells a tale about\nthe introduction of a man's future\nin-laws to his bizarre parents.\nWhilst Val's girlfriend's father is a US senator who campaigns for\nhigher moral standards, his own\nparents' lifestyle couldn't be more\ndifferent. His dad, played by\nRobin Williams, is Jewish, gay\nand owns a drag-club while his \"mother\" is Albert, the\nresplendent star of the club. The film is centred around\nthe build-up to the big meeting and there are many genuinely funny moments as Albert tries to act more manly\nso he can pose as Val's uncle. The camp ness of the\nentire cast is overplayed but not so much that it's irritating\nand Gene Hackman is excellent as the right-wing\nRepublican. The glitzy setting of Miami is a perfect backdrop to these outrageous characters and contributes to\nthe overall impression that the cast are probably enjoying\nthemselves just as much as the audience.\nBroken Arrow, made at the crest\nof John Travolta's latest wave,\ngives him his first real role as a villain. As tr each oro us Major\nDeakins in the US Air Force he\nsteals a stealth bomber carrying\nnuclear warheads in an extortion\nbid which puts millions of lives in\ndanger. Naturally, only one man\ncan stop him and this is Riley\nHale, played by Christian Slater,\nVirgin Hammersmith\nLiar Liar\n12.40. 2.50, 5.00, 7,10. 9.20\nScream\n4.00. 6.30. 9.00\nReturn of The Jedi\n12.20, 3.15. 6.15. 9.10\nThe English Patient i1.10.8.10 Virgin Trocadero\nLiar Liar\n12.20. 2.30. 5.05. 7.15. 9.30\nScream\n12.30, 3-30. 6.10. 9.00\nStar Wars\n12.00, 2..45. 5.30. 8.30\nEddie\n12.10, 6.00\nOdeon Marble Arch\nhis one-time pupil who must use everything he learnt\nfrom his mentor to destroy him. This is, in a nutshell, complete and utter nonsense of the first degree. It's got nonstop action, plenty of explosions and the ubiquitous red\nflashing timer on the bomb and nothing else. Travolta\nisn't even particularly good as the villain, seeming to just\ncruise through the film rather than develop his character,\nalthough, to be fair, the script gives hm little choice. Slater\nis fine although again there's nothing for him to work\nwith. There's also a real risk of getting dizzy from all the\ncircling the camera does but t hafs typical of John Woo,\nthe director. Still, if ifs explosions and mindlessness you're Odeon Kensington\nafter then this will do fine\nDonnie Brasco\n12.10. 3.30. 6.2S.910 Scream\n12.30. 3.10. 6.00. 8.50\nLiar Liar\n12.30. 2.55. 5.50. 8.40\nDonnie Brasco\n12.55. 3.45. 6.35. 925\nLiar Liar\n12.15. 2.35. 4.55. 7.15. 9-40\nScream\n3.15. 7.00, 9.35\nLast week it was Donnie Brasco, now we're giving away\nThe Birdcage. Thanks to various generous people at MGM we're giving you the chance to win one of a pair of videos\nof this latest retail release.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND MAY LETTERS & EDITORIAL 2 3\nread the self confessed\nConservative's ranting s as to the\nmerits of the Tory Party and his ideas\nas to the relative short comings of the\nLabour Party. While it would be generous to suggest that his outpourings\nhave had any effect on the result of\nthe General Election, the abandonment of almost fifty years of Felix\nneutrality is regrettable.\nMaybe next time Mr Baker opens\nhis mouth he will have more consideration for the historical impartiality\nof his student newspaper and of the\nability of IC students to make up\ntheir own opinions.\nYours disappointed ly, Ben Weir\nHopefully page twenty's column,\nwritten by a leading member of the\nLabour Club in response to Mr Baker will redress the balance.\nThree into two won't go\nDear Felix,\nI was intrigued to note that Ian\nTaylor, Minister for Science, repeated a line I have taken issue with\nbefore, that the 'three main disciplines of science, engineering and\ntechnology are alive and well\". This\nimplies that there are those three well\nrecognised and distinct fields of\nequal standing. I am an engineer, and\nfind that people define engineering in\na number of ways but with a large\nmeasure of agreement. Similarly, I have studied some science and\nworked with scientists on a number\nof projects, so could define the field\nreasonably well. However, the implication that technology is an equivalent and distinct field, I find difficult\nto comprehend. I have not found any\nuniform definition of the word; there\nare no degrees, research councils,\nand few job titles, which will claim\nthe field as their own.\nThere seems to be no way to clearly distinguish the word technology\nfrom either, or both, science and\nengineering, since it often used interchangeably with them. My jaundiced\nview is that people tend to use it in\nrecent years when they are not really\nsure what professional engineering\nis, so choose 'technology' as a neu-tr al, non-offensive word. This simply\nreveals a lack of understanding of the\ntrue nature of engineering and a need, as if we didn't already know, to\neducate the public and the politicians\nas to its importance. I say all this in\nfull awareness of the word in the\nname of this college. It must have\nseemed like a good idea at the time.\nColin Ledsome\nIndustrial Training Programme\nToo much of a good thing\nDear Felix,\nIf I get one more of my friends\ntelling me I go to 'The PG Tips' col-le ge,I 'll just cry.\nWho's idea was it to have our\nname all over the tube, associated\nwith this new gimmicky what s it? I'm never going to live it down.\nYours sincerely,\nE.

Student Newspaper of Imperial College\nEditor Alex Feakes / Advertising Manager Mark Baker\nThis morning, the country will be\nwaking up under a blanket of recycled analysis from yesterday's General Election. Though not all of\nthe constituencies will have declared\nyet, the general picture will have\nbegun to emerge, or so the p sep ho logi sts will have us believe. As our\nadmittedly poor (we did it more for\nfun than serious comparison), exit\npoll shows, the extrapolation of\nlocal results across the entire country can have wild and unexpected\nresults. A Tory majority of 255\nwould 'paint the map blue' and at\nthe same time provide our remaining\nhospitals with an awful lot of business from disaffected voters.\nCloser to home, the descent of ABA Copytech into receivership has left\nmany people photocopier less and\nconfused. It does rather leave the\nCollege in a difficult situation, as\nthey now have to renegotiate a new\ncontract for the site, that is if they\nwish to entrust such a vital resource\nto vagaries of external companies'\nfinancial instabilities. I hope that\nmore care might be taken to investigate the longevity of any future\nmanager of Imperial College's images' capital.\nAbout this tent. When Felix sounded\nout the opinion of Imperial\nCollege's peers in the higher\nEducation market, we received, as\nexpected, a number of titters, giggles\nand unprintable expressions of dis-belief. One has to wonder if IC's famous desire to maintain and protect its reputation may have shot\nwide of the mark and let its members\nspeculate, once again, as to the primary aims and objectives of this\ninstitution.\nFinally, the second election for next\nyear's ICU President is nearly upon\nus. Papers come down this evening,\nbut at the time of going to press there\nwere no fully proposed and seconded candidates, though there were\nthree names up.

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND MAY THE CHOICE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION? 19\nthat you have no argument against incest. This couple is behaving no differently from millions of others across the world in stable relationships who use\ncontraceptives. Obviously they enjoy the sex or\nthey would not be doing it and as brother and sister,\nwho can say that other couples have a greater love\nfor one another. With regards to brother-brother or\nsister relationships, are these any different to those\nenjoyed by homosexual couples? It seems to me\nthat to discriminate against the former must lead to\nthe same treatment against the latter. I am sure you\nwill agree that the issue is not so clear cut anymore.\nI don't have the answers, the question is what do\nyou think?????\nIf you still have not come up with a credible a rgu ment, then your conclusion has to be that there is\nnothing wrong with incest. It may disgust you but\nthen that is just your opinion. Using myself as an\nexample, (and at the risk of trivia lising the issue) I personally detest boiled cabbage hut 1 do not think\nit is wrong for others to eat them!! If we just go\nback to the case of parent-child incestuous relation-ships, logic tells us that if we accept brother-sister\nrelationships then we have to accept the former only\nif the child is of the consenting age. I can imagine\nthat the majority of you might be feeling nauseous.\nIf however you have not given yourself any rational\nreasons, then you should not be nauseous, in fact\nyou have no right to be.\nCall it what you will, be it peer pressure, ignorance,\nor just stupidity. One can not escape the fact that |\nsociety has taken upon itself, a sheep-like mental i ty. Think of all the people at schools who begin to\nsmoke and drink because everyone else is doing the\nsame thing. Right from an early age, we are scared\nof speaking our minds and respond as people\nexpect. It's hip to be rude to teachers, drink until\ncomatose, try and pull everything that moves. The\nlist is endless.\nIam not trying to judge any of these activities,\nlust for me record, 1 abhor incest but for my own\npersonal reasons which have been formed after a lot\nof reflection on the subject. What 1 am saying is\nthat before doing anything, you owe it to yourself to\njustify your actions. The unfortunate thing is this.\nAll through our lives, the majority of us cannot\nseem to shake off the pressure of living according\nto people's expectations. BE your own master and\nnot a victim of Pavlovian conditioning!, with your\npersonality being dictated to you by others.\nBetween every stimulus and subsequent reaction,\nthere is a moment in which wc can determine our\nresponse. Many just let the moment pass, thereby\nwasting the opportunity to do something beautiful.\nEach time you conform to someone else's ideal you\ngive up the last of the human freedoms. The right to\nchoose how things affect you. When that goes, you\nbecome another addition to the increasing number\nof the living dead. You have become a zombie.\nThe point I am trying to make is that we have\ncome to a point where we let others form our\nown opinions. Incest has been the topic but there\nare so many other issues that cause us to react without pausing for thought. For a race that prides itself\non being the most intelligent in the animal king-dom, this sort of behaviour is quite unbecoming.\n1. Pavlov was a psychologist who did some famous\nexperiments with dogs- each time he fed one of his\ndogs he would ring a bell. Soon it reached the point\nwhere the dog would begin to salivate on hearing\nthe sound of the bell in anticipation of food, even j though there was none coming!!!\n\n"

On\nThe Sky's Our Terminal, shoes are gazed at\nwith aplomb, and it reminds me of why Ride\nwere so powerful live, infusing wall-of-noise\nguitars with a crystalline beauty. Marijne herself\nis in fine form, voice piercing and clear one\nminute, throaty growling the next. She fends off\nbreast related heckles with a withering gaze,\nand displays an admirably self-deprecating wit\non Foreign Cow, introducing it as a song about\n\"...a really horrible person....that's right, ifs\nme\".

This,' we thought, 'was more like it.'\nThe bassist bounced on, hidden amongst his\nhair and thumping his guitar with a most\npleasing result. The crowd below us moved up\na gear and matched the strobes and lights\nbeat for beat and watched themselves on a screen live from an onstage camera.

Our lads, clearly the superior\nside were beset by horrific setbacks\nthroughout the match. Slough kicked\noff and soon brought the ball to our\nend of the pitch. There they proceeded to kick it between the posts.\nStaggeringly, the referee declared\nthis a goal, just the first of many similar injustices that took place all\nthrough the game. Then, no sooner\nhad the game resumed, than a Slough\nplayer tackled Ed \"regularly gets\ndrugged out of his head\" and took the\nball from him. This was very mean\nsince Ed was clearly still playing\nwith the ball at the time. Yet the referee stoutly refused to blow his w his tle. The rest of the match continued\nin this vein. Despite playing far better football, Slough repeatedly confounded us with such un sporting tricks as kicking the ball to another\nof their players when we tried to\ntackle them.\nOur best chance came late in the\nsecond half when Stan \"takes as\nmany drugs as he can\" cleverly\nthreatened to scream until he wet\nhimself unless we were allowed a shot at goal. The Slough defenders\nstepped aside, leaving top striker\nDoug \"does lots of drug(s)\" a fantastic chance to salvage something.\nUnfortunately after last week's match, Doug went to the \"seven\ndays, one drum beat, no discern able tune\" party at popular rave venue\nThe Sewer. In attempting to kick the\nball, he lost balance and collapsed.\nWitnesses report that he was asleep\nbefore he hit the ground.\nAll in all an unsatisfactory result\nbut definitely not our fault, honest.\nIC I034 Slough College for the\nPhysically Impaired.\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\nHAIR CUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES:=3 r CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\n\u00a3&\u2022 SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage..

But\nthe spirit picked up after a50 win in\nthe first fight. Aris Tagalakis (Royal\nHolloway), Khalid Faiz (UCL),\nGeorge Tsikouras, Steffen\nFredensdorf and Oyvind Fikel and\n(all IC) were part of the UL U five-men team, defeating several universities, including strong teams from\nLoughborough and Glasgow. In the\nfinal, U.W. I.C( Wales) proved to be\nslightly better, winning 3-2, and\nhence taking gold.\nThis year, UL U also had a women's team, but was unsuccessful\ndue to injuries from the individual\nfights on the previous day.\nDespite losing valuable members\nof the team since last year, good\nrecruiting and this important result\nclearly has shown that the IC judo\nsquad still is maintaining its high\nstandards.\nWell done to the UL U team and\nIC players for winning Silver in what\nwas called \"the most spectacular and\ntalented tournament ever seen at the\nBUSA games...\"\nCreditable support for\nIC rowers\nAs part of their team 2000 project,\nBarclaycard are providing sponsorship for four members of the\nImperial College Union Rowing\nsquad.\nThe sponsorships are organised on\na three tier system, developing\npotential British sports stars for the\n2000 Olympiad in Sydney, and providing for the future of British sport\ninto the next millennium.\nConsequently, Simon Dennis,\nRichard Dunne, Lewis Attwell and\nStavros Eyre, who are all currently in\ntraining with the Olympic team, have\nbeen awarded a total of \u00a32800 to foster their future development. All four\ndemonstrated their ability last year,\nwhen they rowed to team gold at the\nUnder 23 World Championships.\nFootball fourths return\nfrom the dead\nThe performance was immaterial, all\nthat mattered was the result, and\nthankfully after trailing 2-0 half-way\nthrough the second-half the victory\nwas obtained.\nThe equation is now simple - our\nfinal game of the season decides\nwhether we are champions, and\nsecure promotion, or also-ran s destined to languish on the scrap-heap\nof football history with San Marino\nand Watford.\nThat afternoon, we showed great\ncharacter to win. Two sloppy goals\nwere conceded and perhaps we\nwould have collapsed earlier in the\nseason, but we climbed out of\nreverse and eventually found our\nway into fifth gear. Dazzla Darren\nled the fight back, dominating the\nattacks, first converting a cross from\nRyan, and then lobbing the keeper in\na shot reminiscent of Asprilla at his\nbest. The winner was scored a few\nminutes from time, with Darren\nagain dribbling to the bye-line and\ncrossing to the back post. Leaping\nlike a salmon in spring, Ryan (the\nshortest player on the field) made no\nmistake with a clinical finish.\nHis overall performance was magnificent - after suffering an early\ninjury he bravely battled on and\ndeservedly scored the winner thanks\nto his unselfish running.\nPaul also played a crucial part, as\nindeed he has done all season, in this\ngame clearing off the line in the last\nminute! This was, needless to say,\ncaused by a mistake from Captain\nStuart, who, after losing all his kit\nonly just managed to get both his\nbrain cells into gear and direct his\nteam to the game.\n\n"

Your best friend is a run-down old-time mobster who's only still in the game because he\ncan't do anything else. He introduced you to the mob\nbecause he trusted you and loved you like a son. But\nnow it's time to turn them in, and you know the man who\ntook you under his wing will be executed by a hit-man\nfor being conned by a cop...\nThafs the situation Joe Pistone faces in this true tale of\nloyalty amongst thieves starring Al Pacino and Johnny\nDepp (looking frighteningly like Freddie Mercury at times).\nIn the name of justice, Pistone (Depp) leaves his family\nbehind and takes on the persona of gangster Donnie\nBrasco, infiltrating a Brooklyn mob by gaining the confidence of an aged hit-man, Lefty (Pacino). Lefty is different\nto the stereotypical gang member we are used to from\nGoodfellas and The Godfather. After twenty years he is\nstill on the bottom rung of the Mafia ladder and suffers\nas the butt of his colleagues' jokes. He has to resort to\nraiding parking meters to supplement his ventures and\nhas a life of talking about fast cars rather than driving\nthem. It is these circumstances that make him look for a gateway to success by adopting Brasco, a seemingly\nsmart, young crook with plenty of ideas. Hard-bitten and\nbrutal as he is, Lefty enjoys having someone look up and\ncare about him, and in his vulnerability he makes a crucial mistake - he trusts Donnie Brasco.\nThe film charts the fall of Brasco's marriage as he gets\nsucked further and further into mob-life. Gradually, it\nseems he begins to forget his true role in the operation\nand, as his friendship with Lefty deepens, he is required\nto conform to what the gang expects of a member. He\nkills and tortures for them and as time passes this seems\nto trouble him less and less. The audience never knows if\nthis is due to him hiding the effects from the mob or his\nfalling for the gangster's way of life. Depp gives a great\nperformance of this deep character and doesn't try to give\naway too much of the agent's psyche.\nAl Pacino achieves the difficult in creating in Lefty a hitman that the audience actually pities and cares for. His\nhardened assassin is insecure in life, knowing nothing\nabout life outside the Mafia and living by its codes and\nrankings. He is not as intelligent as the usual Pacino or\nDe Niro hoodlum and seems gullible, the sort of person\nthat needs a true friend so much that he doesn't see the\nwider picture. The audience finds itself hoping that Brasco\ndoesn't turn the criminals in, just because of the effect this\nwill have on Lefty.\nThis quality acting is combined with some excellent\nscripting and directing. The over-familiar fast and wise\nconversation of most mob films is thankfully avoided,\nreplaced by dialogue that is actually necessary for the\nplot. Some of the scenes near the climax of the film are so\nmemorable that you'll be left pondering this film for\nweeks.\nSuperficially, this film is no different from many other\nMafia films - it even has Bruno Kirby in the high-pitched,\nviolent \"Joe Pesci role\". Yet it is fundamentally a film about\nfriendship and the appeal of the wrong side of the law,\nportraying the effects these can have very dramatically. It\nnever tries to explain Depp's conversion to crime and this\nis just as well, for this is a true story and it would be\nwrong to try and explain a real man's actions unless all\nthe facts were known. Instead it leaves the audience to\ndecide why Brasco, when accused by his wife of becoming just like those he is trying to convict, answers \"I'm not\nbecoming them, I am them.\" chris\nLIAR LIAR\nJim Carrey makes a return to\nall-out comedy after his commercially disastrous stab at\nblack comedy in The Cable Guy. In Liar Liar he plays a successful lawyer whose five-year-old son gets tired of his\ncontinuous lying. So, when his father is a no-show at his\nbirthday party, he makes a wish that for 24 hours his\nfather cannot tell a lie. Miraculously this wish comes true\nand the repercussions for Carrey are pretty catastrophic.\nCarrey has really played safe here with all the usual\nHollywood clich es present and correct. He is divorced but\nnaturally his ex- still has feelings for him despite the fact\nshe is due to move to another city (with annoying cute\nson) along with her oh-so boring boyfriend who she\ndoesn't really even like, let alone love. The day he has to\ntell the truth is also the day when he must lie to win a prestigious alimony case and the outcome will decide\nwhether he is promoted or not. This is the cue for Carrey's unique brand of humour. When he cannot help but tell the\ntruth there are some very funny moments where he\nembarrasses himself and those around him, however the\njokes usually follow two patterns - either he tells the truth\nwhen he would be better lying or just keeping quiet after\nwhich he looks aghast at himself, or he tries to tell a lie\nbut ends up just stammering something in com pre hens i ble. Unfortunately, the film is\nbook ended by some very saccharine moments especially\nthe beginning which sets up the fact that Carrey is really a good man who loves his son and is just overworked and\nharassed by his boss (Amanda Donahoe). Carrey's acting\nstyle (if you can call non-stop mugging acting) is ill suited\nto these serious moments and it is distracting. You are just\nwaiting for the moment when the real comedy starts.\nLuckily when the comedy does come there are some truly\nfunny moments. However, your enjoyment of the film really rests on whether you enjoy seeing physical comedy\n(and Carrey is one of the most physical comedians you\ncould wish to see) being taken to its limits.\nKatie\n\n"

A ha, the SI\nChemical Brothers ore back in town brandishing their new album, Dig Your Own Hole With\nthe recent popularity of all things dance-y, and\nthe Chemicals' high-publicity collaboration with\nNoel Gallagher, the album comes highly-rec-om mended by most of the music press. And\nthey are not an ounce wrong if they do.\nKicking off with the recent single Block\nRockin'Beats, their acidic style comes barging\nthrough. A cool little sample and drums that\nremind me, at any rate, of the Prodigy's Breathe make the tempo trip along a nice old\nrate. The title track, Dig your own hole, will\nkeep you easily satisfied with its reminisces of\nLife is Sweet if you can't let go of the last\nalbum. There's frantic loops of sounds overlaying the usual beeps and clicks but the hard-as-fuck drums are what make it great. Near\nthe middle section, it cuts to what sounds like\na pre-match warm up for the beautiful game\nbut this subsides again and breaks back into\n50,000 B.C. Shudder To Think\nThe album begins with three radio friendly guitar blasts of pop that are akin to the sound of\nthe Gin Blossoms in many ways. From the lead\nsinger's quavering vocals to the mix of distorted\nand jan gly guitars that inevitably lead to at\nleast one solo per song. Following this is 77ie Saddest Day Of My Life that signals the serious\nside of their song writing, a beautiful semi-bal-lad with flamenco style leanings throughout.\nWhat comes next is a dramatic change from\nthe hum along tunes before. You find yourself\nnearly cringing at the unexpected sudden\nchord changes in The Man Who Rolls, a discordant cross with '80s rock air guitar championed\nby the likes of Bon Jovi and co. This all seems a little dated today, unlike the more classic influences of the '60s and 70s that somehow have\nmanaged to stay timeless. Next it's back to the\nstraight guitar pop ballad of Resident Wine and\nif the album contained more of this type of style\nShudder To Think would probably be enjoying\nreasonable success in America as mainstream\nrockers rather than alternative no hope rs. Listening to She's A Skull you begin to see\nwhere the problem is with this album. I'm not\ntrying to pigeon hole them but they seem to\nstuck in some sort of musical quagmire, uncertain whether to go for the soft rock/country and\nwestern approach or just to go all out 'RAAWK'.\nAt the moment they are trying to do both and\nat times sound like they are dying to unleash\nthemselves from the invisible constraints they\nthe in-yer-face techno, Wow.

With barely a second's pause after this track comes the wicked piledriver that is Setting Sun. I don't want to mention Noel Gallagher twice in one review\n(damn...never mind) but if you haven't heard\nthis, then you must have been on Mars, right?\nThe said Mancunian is not the only one lending his vocal talents to the album. Beth Orton\nappears on Where do I Begin, a mellow and\nsubtle song which mutates into a monster of\nGodzilla proportions. The second half of the\nalbum is much quieter and more ambient in\nnature but retains all its latent Chemical fury - if\nthat makes any sense. The last track, especial-ly, The Private Psychedelic Reel'is totally cool.\nThe Chemicals are back and they are definitely rocking. Now, I'm just waiting for the\nProdigy album...(8) Alok\nhave put on their music. The album ends on\nHop On One Foot, a discordant guitar nightmare that squeals into oblivion.\nHalf the album is disturbingly influenced by\n'80s guitar 'RAAWK' while the other half is\npleasant enough straight up rock tinged with a bit of C&W. Album of the year. I shudder to\nthink. (3)\nJason\nTHE BARN TAPES\nArnold\nWho are Arnold? The name conjures up visions\nof a guitar driven trio of 17 year-olds from\nBasingstoke. Their album cover gives no clues\nexcept that they are signed to Creation, which\nisn'ta bad start. And The Barn Tapes? To start\nwith there are only 8 tracks, which isn't such a good start as I'm always a little suspicious of a band that don't feel they've written 10 or 11\ngood songs to date. They aren't even 8 memorable songs at that but a succession of soft\nfolksy indie ballads with unnecessarily lengthy\nguitar exits - not consistent with the teenage 3\npiece theory. The songs are pretty with a spacey, float y quality to them - an ambient-indie cross over vibe achieved by the liberal\nuse of acoustic guitars and a haunting male\nvocal.\nThe production is lo-ft and the lyrics are a bit\nof a weak point. The problem is that it just isn't exciting, it fails to capture a specific mood - too\nslow to get your head nodding, but too upbeat\nme anti\nIN IT FOR THE MONEY\nSupergrass\nHmm.

In its place is a darker\nexhibition of those traditional second album\ntopics of cynicism against the record industry,\nand of course missing the woman back\nhome.

This is a very\ngood record, make no mis-take, but you get the feeling it could have\nbeen so much more.

    "content": "Paul Weller - The Unauthorised Biography\nSteve Malins\nPaul Weller - The\nUnauthorised\nBiography is published\nby Virgin, Price \u00a39.99.\n\u2022 V.T82050? This book, although unauthorised, gives a very frank and\ndetailed look into the life of Paul Weller. We are told how\nhe lost his virginity, the ups and downs of his marriage\nand of course about the bands and music. From The Jam\nthrough The Style Council to his solo work we get to hear\nabout his twenty-five year career in minute detail.\nAt school, \"where I decided I would show the bastards I didn't need their rules or their education\", Paul Weller\nformed The Jam. A rapid ascendancy to stardom fol-lowed, which in retrospect was too sudden for the young\nband members. Break-up of The Jam highlights one of\nthe Paul Weller character traits which is often touched on\nin the book. His sudden break with the past left the other\nex-Jam members feeling ostr aci sed and marginal is ed,a feeling he was to engender in his once-friends throughout\nhis career.\nFeelings of isolation from the Weller camp are heightened by the fact that Paul's father, John, has always been\nhis band manager. Although John's record industry\nknowledge is questionable, he has never been persuaded to leave his son's side as \"Paul likes his family around\nhim\". This tight circle has caused both personal and professional problems - the Wellers were recently sued for\nroyalties it was alleged the father had stashed away.\nMoney has been a powerful influence in Weller's career. When the final album of The Style Council was\nrejected by Polydor (who had paid a \u00a31 million advance\nfor it), the Weller family thought they could dictate terms to\nany record company. This proved not to be the case and\nhis current label Go Discs! were the last resort.\nWeller has always moved on and tried to be fashion-able, although this has often caused him to be accused of\nplagiarism. He himself said what would seem to be the\nkiss of death for any self respecting artist; \"I'm not bothered about originality. I don't even think about it.\"\nExperiments with live house music in the early 90's have\nluckily given way to his more soulful, thinking and in fact\noriginal current voice. His recording now is always live\nand unedited, the lack of click track adding an extra raw\nedge, which causes consternation to the American market he has so far failed to crack.\nIn this biography, Steve Malins goes into great depth on\nthe whys are wherefores of Weller. His lyrics are dissect-ed, relationships perused and clothes picked over. Malins\nwriting is lucid but is just too detailed for all but the hardened fan. Although fair and by no means positive\nthroughout, the detail is just too much -1 skipped numerous passages that seemed unnecessarily bogged down.\nTo sum up, this is only for the hardened Weller fan. If\nyou are merely interested in him, save the ten ner this\nbook costs and buy a Weller album instead. I strongly recommend his recent solo efforts Wild Wood or Stanley\nRoad. Hot Lips\nLearn to type the multimedia way\nTouch-type Trilingual and Keyboard Master\nBVG's Keyboard Master\nand Touch Type Trilingual\nMin re q: PC CD-Rom,\nWindows 3-1, 4Mb mem-or y,5 Mb disk space\nKeyboard\nMaster\nIt is odd that, although I am a educated, computer-liter-ate, academic product of the modern age, I have never\nlearned to type. All those essays, their paragraphs and\ntheir words were produced with a technique that was\nreally just a refined version of the two-finger stab.\nThe problem is, as computing students are only to keen\nto inform you, the Qwerty keyboard is actually designed to\nmake typing difficult and hence slow. The old mechanical\nOlympias would jam if you tried to type more than Iwo letters per second so it was necessary to make things harder for the long-suffering corporate secretaries.\nThis throwback is the reason why typing practice simply\ndoes not lead to perfection; the illogical key layout\nmeans that the hopeful typist has to adopt a rigid\nsystem so that they may eventually move their eyes\nfrom their fingers to somewhere more useful.\nUnfortunately, early attempts at computer typing\ntutors have been fairly dire; I spent many hours with\nthe tacky Mavis Beacon package with no noticeable\nimprovement. Two of the latest programs are BVG's Keyboard Master and its euro-centric big brother\nTouch Type Tri-Lingual, and they are a big improve-ment.\nKeyboard Master is simple and quick to use, offering a variety of lesson lengths as well as exercises. It still suffers\nfrom the usual 'dad's a sad salad lad' ennui, but the well\nstructured program moved quickly enough to prevent\nextreme boredom. You are entertained with fancy graphics and midi classics such as Tears before Christmas'\nwhile the essentially subconscious business of hand-eye\nco-ordination takes place.\nTri-Lingual is more involved and harder to use. It offers\nthe exercises, display and translations in English, French\nor German, theoretically helping your language skills and\ntyping simultaneously. I experienced some problems running this software, with 'garbage' screen fonts and unpredictable behaviour. The extra sophistication is, as usual, at\nthe expense of 'pay ability'. There is no doubt that these programs work. Admittedly\nbeing a musician and an accomplished crap typist made\nme an easy subject, but I found that I was touch-typing\nreasonably well after only a few hours. Once you start,\nany typing is essentially practice so the programs do\nbecome redundant fairly rapidly.\nIn summary, a bought, borrowed or stolen copy of\nKeyboard Master as a low effort tutor and, just like me,\nyou will soon be able to type with our with our wo th out looking at you fingers.

    "content": "18 INCEST - FELIX FRIDAY 2 ND MAY a use for thought, or the\nast great abomination?\nNgozi Dozie takes a[r] evolutionary view\nIncest. This word never fails to conjure up\nstrong emotions, normally those of revulsion.\nBut why? What a stupid question to ask I hear\nyou say. Nonetheless it is noteworthy that\n| nine times out of ten, the only argument against this\n'mother of all taboos' is of the genre, \"it's just\nwrong\", \"that's so disgusting\". The list is endless. I suggest that for the majority of us, our supposed\nnatural revulsion, is a result of social conditioning.\nFrom birth, it has been ingrained into our consciousness that incest is a vile act performed by\nsocial deviants. As difficult as it may be, I urge you\nto clear your mind of such thoughts. Objectivity is\nscn ti al if any progress is to be made in this high-1 ly controversial subject. By the end of these ram-y bling s of mine if you see the light then perhaps there\n| is hope for Society.\nNow since the beginning of time, there have\nbeen incestuous relationships. This cannot be\ndenied. It is also accurate to say that it has also been\nregarded as an abominable act. My question is\nwhy? Why is this \"mixing of blood\" denounced\nunequivocally by society as a whole?\nThe most obvious response is that incest results\nin deformed babies. Surely this is enough to\nconvince us of the vile nature of the act. However,\nlet us examine this point in a bit more detail. It is a scientific fact that because members of a family\nhave the same genetic makeup, any defect in chromosomes may be multiplied through an incestuous\nrelationship. This is a biological fact and cannot be\ncontested. The first point I would like to make is\nthat early civilisations could not have been aware of\nthis phenomenon. Most probably, the numbers of\nincestuous relationships were outweighed inn umer ably by the so called 'normal' ones. Thus, the scientific evidence for a high proportion of deformities\nwould have been lacking. There is however, a flip\nside to this coin. The effect of dominant genes that\nbenefit the individual can also be multiplied, indeed\nsome babies born out of incestuous relationships\nhave been prodigies. Now I can already hear some\nsay that since the number of deformed babies outnumber the geniuses, the law of averages is trying\nto tell us something. Still this does not address the\nissue as to why incest is wrong. In any case; let's proceed.\nThe media has been lull of cases involving the\nunfortunate sexual abuse of children by their\nparents. This I would imagine is the sort of image\nthat is on the minds of most people whilst reading\nthis essay. 1 think that this clouds the issue as we\narc now bordering on pae do philia and exploitation\nof children so I propose we keep it simple. Think\nof two adults. Male or female, it does not matter\nwhich. If the combinations you have chosen arc of\nthe same sex, please ignore any opinions you may\nhave on homosexuality, it just clouds the issue. The\ncouple arc borne of the same parents and more\nimportantly, they are both consenting adults. Now\ngive me a good reason why they should not do as\nthey please! Fire away.\nDeformed babies!! OK, the couple use a con-dom, girl's on the pill, guy gets a vasectomy-the possibility of a baby is virtually negligible.\nNow where is the problem? I know those of the\nCatholic faith believe that all form of contraception\nis wrong but for those not of this religious di sposi tion, think hard. Why cannot this brother and sister\n(for example) live together without suffering from\nthe revulsion and scorn of the rest of society? There\nare those who regard sex as a means of expressing\none's love to another, or maybe it is solely for plea-sure. If you are of this opinion, then I put it to you\n\n"

    "content": "cAnd on the seventh dug...\nr~ or seven days during April, Federal Court 23C in\nISydney, Australia was packed out for a civil trial over\nalleged breaches of fair trading laws. The unusual size of\nthe audience was not because of any huge sums\ninvolved; the company being sued had gone into voluntary liquidation a week before and the other parties were\nalready bankrupt. No, the reason the international media\nhad flocked to Sydney was to witness a battle of ideas\nbetween science and religion.\nA Professor of Geology, Ian Plimer, from the University\nof Melbourne, has already sold his house to take a group\nof creationists to court. He intends to stop them from misleading consumers with their \"gospel of deceit\". The case\ncentres on the claims by Dr Allen Roberts of Sydney and\nhis organisation Ark Search Inc. that the remains of\nNoah's Ark have been discovered in Turkey. Ian Plimer\nwants to prevent Roberts from using \"junk science\" to\nback up his claims about the Ark in brochures, tapes and\nvideos that have been sold to raise money for expeditions. He is joined in court by a former creationist who is\nsuing Allen Roberts for using drawings from his book The\nArk of /voa/i 'without his permission.\nThe trial is the outcome of a highly publicised war of\nwords bel we en Professor Plimer and Dr Roberts. Roberts\nfirst came to media attention in 1991 when he was held\ncaptive by Kurdish guerrillas while in Turkey. After his\nreturn in 1992 he began a lecture tour of Australia to raise\nfunds for Ark Search Inc. as their 'archaeological research\nconsultant'. Plimer was thrown out of three lectures when\nhe tried to ask questions about the nature of the scientific\nevidence for the Ark. The courts first got involved in May\n1992, when Roberts sued Plimer for remarks made during\na Melbourne Radio program.\nIn 1994 Plimer visited the site of the alleged Ark near\nMount Ararat in Turkey. He subsequently published his\nown book, Telling Lies for God', in which he accused the\ncreationists of scientific fraud.\nThe controversial boat-like structure first appeared dur-.\ning an earthquake in 1948 and it has been known for\nyears that it has the same dimensions as Noah's Ark\ndetailed in Genesis. Plimer's geological studies led him to\nconclude that it was an unremarkable rock formation\ncaused by folding of the ancient sea floor over 110 million\nyears ago. He found no evidence of petrified wood, iron\nrivets, stone anchors and fossilised animal dung and hair\nthat Roberts and Ark Search say they discovered at the\nsite. Plimer hopes the courts will denounce the assertions\nby Roberts that he has carried out any scientific studies.\nPlimer and Fasold have tried to extend the scope of the\ntrial from the narrow limits of commercial law by calling\nwitnesses from religion and education. Plimer fears that\ncreationists are misleading young people with their\n'pseudo-scientific nonsense'. He says he was motivated\nto take the case to court by surveys that show one in five\nAustralian science students hold creationist views.\nOn the first day of the trial the Judge ruled out statements by an American anti-creationist campaigner.\nNonetheless Plimer hopes a favourable judgement will\ndraw attention to the growing number of private fundamentalist Christian schools that teach creation theory.\nReligious supporters of Plimer include the Anglican\neg in s in the famous\nill en ges Creationist\n0 years old.\nArchbishop of Brisbane who wrote in a preface to\nPlimer's book that creationism is \"anti-knowledge, anti-religious and anti-science\". Another Anglican rector and\nphysics graduate, was ready to argue in court that science cannot be used to 'prove' the existence of God. But\ntheological arguments were not allowed by the Judge.\nThe nature of scientific enquiry and evidence were central to Plimer's case against the creationist idea that evolution is unproved 'theory' and not fact. During discussions about the methods and philosophy of science, the\nJudge made sure the court had lessons in Darwinian\nevolution, Lamarckian inheritance and Karl Popper's theory that science advances by falsification. Plimer also\nattacked Roberts' academic credentials. It was revealed\nthat his doctorate in Christian Education came from a correspondence Bible College in Florida, that is not accredit-ed. Roberts admitted that he had not personally carried\nout any scientific tests at the Ark site. He also tried to distance himself from claims made by Ark Search Inc. by\ndenying any knowledge of the sale of their products at\nhis lectures. However he had to admit that the company\nwas registered at his home address.\nThe trial hearings ended on April 17th and the Judge is\nexpected to give his conclusions in a few weeks. If the\njudgement goes Plimer's way, it will be the first time creationist beliefs have been challenged using consumer\nprotection laws. The authorities have always been reluctant to prosecute traders who make dubious scientific\nclaims, because of the difficulty in deciding whether\nstatements are given as fact or opinion. A positive result\nfor Plimer may have an impact on new age crystal healers as well as creationists.\nFew observers in the Federal Court are prepared to\npredict the outcome of the trial. On the last day the Judge\nquestioned whether the law should be used to settle disputes of this kind and if Plimer's case was an attack on\nfreedom of speech. In his defence Plimer says he got sick\nof being sued for expressing his views (eight other writs\nhave been served and withdrawn by creationist groups)\nand decided to go on the attack, \"You shouldn't treat a crazy, religious cult with kid gloves\". In fairness, Roberts'\nhad little respect for freedom of expression during his lecture tour, throwing out anyone who challenged his views.\nWhatever the result of the trial, the battle between creationists and evolutionists will continue to rage. Ever since\nthe world-famous 'Scopes trial' in 1925, when John\nScopes, a teacher from Tennessee, was convicted for\nteaching evolution, both sides have made frequent trips\nto court, but it seems unlikely that the dispute will ever be\nsettled in a court room.
