    "content": "FELIX\nRCS UNION MEETING\nFINLEY GETS THE BIRD Thursday, February 1st1962, saw what\nmust surely have been one of the most stormy\nmeetings in the history of the R.C.S. Union.\nPremeeting preparations by Council members\nand the masses alike were manifest in the\nquantities of Missiles (assorted), fumigation\napparatus and protective clothing gathered\ninto an already overcrowded Chemistry\nLecture Theatre B. The meeting started\nonly 5 minutes late \u2014 the Chairman\nomitting to declare a time \u2014 not surprisingly so after Physics I had literally given\nhim the bird, large economy size in the form\nof a stuffed albatross. Certain startling changes\nin the vestments of Council members proved\nwise considering their ordeal to come.\nTo make matters worse an uncontrollable\nexcitement on the the part of Secretary Harri whilst reading the minutes nearly brought\na premature finish to the proceedings when\nhe all but succumbed to the hail of apples\nas he disported his naked and none too sight-t ly legs on the bench. As the indecipherable\nmonotone of his reading dragged on a stamping of feet on the floor of the House rose in\npitch to louder than the Lone Ranger sound-track, Chairman McPherson took matters in\nhand by declaring Round 3 ended and sending the Secretary in boxing attire back to his\ncorner.\nNevertheless, it transpired from Matters\nArising that brilliant judi cal negotiations by\nSecretary Harris had all but settled the long\nand costly feud between Chem. Eng. I and\nBot. II. Expenses in the case having risen\nnow to an incalculable sum \u2014 viz: 1 inflatable Yogi Bear, 2 Rino packets (large size?\nand assorted trousers at 7/6 per peak. Chiei\nJustice Harris had finally arranged, in conjunction with Guilds, that the most oppressed\nof the hard-done by Botanists should be entertained free by Chem. Eng. at their forthcoming Dinner, with the option of his entertaining them afterwards.\nAt this stage the strain became too much\nfor the Secretary who in nervous fidgeting\ndropped his glasses and on diving below the\nBench for them, came up eating one of the\napples which had been so viciously hurled\nat him only a few minutes previously.\nThe President now rose, and in fine Scottish tones called upon Vice-President Pete\nYoung to make announcement of the forthcoming sports contest with the \u2014 Guildsmen.\nHis familiar and clear voice echoed round the\nTheatre and must have touched each heart in\nthe sincerity of appeal for support. There was\nsome doubt in the minds of Union members,\nthough, when he had the misfortune to emphasize the \"Mixed Women's Hockey Team\"\nand his subsequent inability to explain the\nfull potentialities of a \"mixed woman\" resulted in his narrowly escaping a guided egg.\nGrunter Harris, now wisely using his gloves\nas a Sporran, then rose to bee support from\nn embers inclined towards Boxing in the con-:est for the Rector's Cup. He then repeated\nhis speech, loud enough for people to hear,\nind a hushed Union received the news that\nGuildsmen are reported to be actually train-ing.\nThe new Oriental President, Finling McPherson, in his China-type hat followed this\nby announcing that much merry-making\nshould now ensue to celebrate that this was\nthe Birthday of l Miss Doreen Rouse, Queen\nof Jezebel. He formally presented her with a cake and the whole Union rose to sing Happy Birthday\". A brief and expert speech of thanks\nwas delivered by Miss Rouse with Regal\nelegance. The Subsequent rejoicing, durin j which Robin Salmon caught an egg a i met at his tin helmet, though unfortunately break\ning it in the process, ended with the ammon-i a cal fumigation of the Theatre by the Secretariat due to the quantities of eggs, apples\nand bird seed which had been hurled about\nThils was followed by the most import^\nant event of the day, the Presentation of a, revolutionary new Constitution by Mr. Dan\nElwyn Jones, dressed in the garb of a Zulu!\nwarrior, the Council to have a mono poli sing control of the Union despite the wishes of its\nMembers. With h& audience eagerly anticipating a great Revolution he read out the\nDocument:\n1. All Union Meetings are to be herein-after held in the Queen's Arms Public House,\nstarting at opening'time and ending at closing time or when n,> member of the Union\nis able to rise from the floor whichever be\nthe sooner.\n2. All females shall henceforth and here-in after be debarred from Union activities unless they fall under the classification of Bona\nide women (according to the standards sel\nby Youngs's Modulus).\nAt this point the Vice-President, Pete\nYoung, gave a concise synopsis of his Modulus, graphically illustrated upon the Epidiascope.\nThe Vice-President shall live up to his title\nby examining all R.C.S. women to see that\nthey are up to these standards; and also any\nother women he can lay hands on.\n3. The Secretary of R.C.S. shall live up\nto the well established tradition of being completely illiterate, punch drunk and booze sod-den.\n4. All R.C.S. Committees are to meet once\nonly during the year, this occasion being located at the Red Lion in Glasgow on New\nYear's Eve.\nThe following new committees shall be\nformed immediately: Botanical Trousers Pre.\nserva tion Committee; Yogi Bear Deflation\nCommittee; and the Committee for the Constant Revision of the ty C.S. Constitution.\n5. The President of R.C.S. shall have a complete mental and physical overhaul to\nascertain his suitability for the job, and his\ncapabilities for the ar dous tasks he must\nface during his term of office. Unless he be\nover 6 ft. tall bearded and with a criminal record he shall be ineligible for the post.\n6. The Royal School of Mines shall here-in in after cease to exist, being henceforth a subsidiary of the Royal Geology Department.\n(This was hailed by trumpet blasts from the\nGeology section of the audience.)\n7. In order to avoid further confusion the\nMaths. Department shall be immediately\nbanded over to the Royal College of Art.\nHere, in as wer to question, Dan Jones affirmed that this would raise the number of\nwomen in the Maths. Department from 12\nto 372.\n8. The long awaited take over of the Physics Block by the Royal Borough of Kensington Department of Public Health for use rs\na sewage farm be concluded without delay.\n9. The demolition squad now engaged\nin knocking down the old Physics Building\nshall continue the good work with the new\nPhysics Building. \u00bb\u00bb\u2022\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nLast Saturday the Soccer team j reached the final of the U.L. Cup for the 4th successive season, by beating the School of Pharmacy, 2-1, at Berrylands.\nOur opponents who are in a division below us in the University League weren't any\nmatch for I.C. and didn't look at all like\nscoring, being content to defend, seemingly\nto keep the score down. This they achieved\nby packing their penalty area, a move which\nI'.C. hadn't the faintest idea how to counteract. Insistence on trying to play the ball\nthrough the middle, rather than to the wings,\nmet with the same result as if there had\nbeen a brick wall around the penalty area.\nThis was made worse by the fact that the\ntwo wings-halves kept moving upfield to\ncongest even further the already-crowded\nmiddle of the field. The small size of the\npitch helped us very little, but a few ideas\nmust show themselves in the final against\nQ.M. C., who have a defence comprising 4\nor 5 University players.\nThe pitch was in excellent condition, our 6\nsupporters vociferous and, despite a referee\nwho seemed to be against bodily contact and\nwho disallowed what seemed to be a reasonable goal. We scored once in each half, both\ntimes through Collin Casemore, the outside-left, to win an un in spirited game.\nCUP FINAL SATURDAY, MARCH3 RD AT MOT SPUR PARK\nIn the past forth night the 1st XI has won\ntwo further league games, beating Battersea\nand U.C., both by 3-0, and now seem to be\nin a commanding position in the League with\nKings as our closest chal leg jer sl However,\nall things haven't been easy; last Saturday\nChrist's College, Cambridge, gave us our\ngreatest beating for at least 3 seasons: 7-2.\nA nightmare display by Hugh Payne in goal,\nwho let 5 goals he should have saved, saw\nus 5-0 down at half-time, and a great display\nby the defence in the second-half kept double\nfigures at bay. This was followed by another\nsuperb half of defending on the following\nWednesday against U.C. which resulted in\nour 4th clean sheet of the season. With only\n8 men the 2nd XI went to U.C., and after\nbeing 2 goals down, fought back to beat U.C. Ill by 3-2 \u2014 an extremely sound display,\nbut the following week they were beaten 1-4\nat home by U.C. II, which may well mean\nthay they lose their Division of the League.\nThe 3rd XI lost again, this time to U.C.4 th, and seem certain to finish bottom of\ntheir league for the second season running,\nbut as the 5th XI nave won 9 out of then-last 10 games, and three league games in the\nlast forth night, the 4th may again not be relegated and 5th not promoted.\nThe unpredictability of the 6th XI remains\na mystery and is born out by the fact that\nthey beat City Bank 7-0 last Saturday and\nlost to Goldsmiths III 2-10 the following\nWednesday.\nThe 7th XI seem unfortunate in that they\nhave lost their last two games by the odd\ngoals, while the Ex. 7th have now scored 90\ngoals in 16 matches, their latest victories\nbeing over Nat. Prov. Bank and Westminster\nBank nth teams by 10-3 and 11-0 respective-ly-CROSS COUNTRY This term got off to a good start with successive wins for the first team against U.C.. London Hosp., and Cranwell. The second\nteam, meanwhile, were showing similar form\nand again further increased their lead at the\nhead of U.L. League II.\nHowever, the next two Wednesdays, in\nstrongly contested matches against Borough\nRoad and St. Mary's training colleges, the opposition just had the edge on us \u2014 due mainly to our being we axe nea at the head of the\nfield.\nWith 18 teams in the Q.M. C. invitation race\nheld over 1\\ miles of undulating country \u2014\nincluding 4 miles of heavy plough, the result was a win for Leeds University over\nCambridge with I.C. third beating Bristol,\nOxford, Sheffield, Exeter. I.C. also retained\nthe Banks trophy \u2014 awarded to the 1s tU.L team, and again further increased their lead\nat the top of League I. The welcome return \"visit of John Collins\ngreatly increased our strength by putting In\na creditable performance, coming 5th in a field of 150.\nIn similar field in the U.C. invitation 5\nmiles held the following Saturday at Parliament Hill, I.C. put in a repeat performance\nof the week before coming 3rd to Cambridge\nand Nottingham with Oxford 4th. Individual winner was Farrington (U.C.) with Ted\nWilkins (I.C.) only 16 sec. behind in 3rd place.\nThe following Wednesday I.C. heavily defeated Reading University 30-50 over our\nhome course.\nLast Saturday, with a few of them representing the University for the U. A.U. champs, we c once ede d heavily to Vale of\nAylesbury who had the first four men home.\nHYDE PARK ROAD \u2014 RELAY 1962\nThis Saturday the College once again\nwelcomes students from all over Great Britain to the 14th annual invitation Hyde Park\nRoad Relay, organised by the Cross Country Club. A record entry of over 80 teams \u2014\n480 runners \u2014 have entered, so keeping the\nrecord of its being the largest relay in Europe\nand possibly the world.\nThe course this year has been slightly altered from last year's, but is still just under\nthree miles long. The start, as in previous\nyears, is at the West End of Rotten Row at\n3.00 p.m. prompt. Pat Sage, A.A.A. Honorary Team Manager, has kindly consented to\nstart the race.\nThe result of the race is as open as ever.\nManchester University, la fet year's winners,\nare favourites for the Sir Roderic Hill Cup,\nand Queens College Cambridge, the holders\n\u2014 for the Imperial College Union Cup for\nminor colleges (under 500 male students).\nHowever, Birmingham University and Leeds\nUniversity will be challenging strongly, while\nour own team, running well this season, has\nan outside chance. Some fast laps are ex-pec ted, especially if there are good cond it ions. Turner and Briault of Cambridge Colleges, Hill of Manchester and Farringdon ol\nU.C. should lap in about 14 minutes.\nThe Imperial College team w j ll in cude four of last year's team, which finished third\nafter the closest finish ever \u2014 the first five\nteams finished within 20 seconds after 90\nminutes of racing. The team will be from:\nJohn Collins running for the 7th and last (?)\ntime, John Cleator (3rd fastest lap last year),\nTed Wilkins (2nd U.L. Champs.), Pete Roy\n(who ran for Birmingham Jast year, Dave\nHammonds, John Young and Jim Bernard,\nnow fully recovered from illness which kept\nhim out of last year's team. Whoever runs\nwill do so with the best wishes of the College,\nand with your support might well bring off\na surprise victory.\nET TU BRUTE\nTOGA\nOR NOT TOGA\n9th March 1962\nTICKETS ON SALE IN I.C.

No-one\nis expected to object to the two year rule being waived for her benefit.\nFreda has a bright exterior but a cool nat-ure. Many a visit is paid to her, but no-one\nhas ever been seen taking her out. Her views\non I.C. students, founded on two years' ex-peri en ce, are sad and cynical. People approach her, she complains, with but one object in mind. She has accepted her role, how-ever, and can show her contempt for those\nwhom she dislikes by withholding her fa v ours.

    "content": "FELIX NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION No. 172. FEBRUARY16 TH.1962 PRICE 4D. Have you paid for it\nEditor speaks\nOnce again it becomes the Editor'sun for u nate job to bring to the notice of his readers\nthe sad financial aspect of the newspaper.\nEach issue between 25/- and 30/- di sap pears, either in the form of \"lost\" copies of\nFelix, or, as is more often the case, b latent theft of the money itself from the various\ncollecting receptacles (It might not seem\nmuch in money but cover ting it back to\ncopies its 75 to 150 each time). We realise\nthat the headline might well offend some\npeople and for this we apologise, the people\ntowards which this article is aimed are the\npersons who (heaven knows why) out of instinct keep a \"free\" copy, or a \"lucky\" dip.\nSome of you will undoubtedly say that it\nmust be outsiders; this is indeed a possible\nsolution, one which we are prepared to ad-mit, BUT it could be someone within the College. The next line is that it is just one particular person. If it is, according to the balance sheet for past ten years, he or she has\nbeen at the College for the last seven years!\n(This rules out an undergraduate, seven\nyears is a little long for one degree. A dishonest P.G. maybe) There are many sol ut ions, each with its own defence, but whatever the solution, we are still left with the\nUnsavoury knowledge that petty thefts of\none sort or another have cost this newspaper\n\u00a3200 in the last seven years.\nHARD FOUGHT SEMIFINAL The I.C. Hockey Team played two\ncup matches in three days last week. The\nfirst, a second round replay was won con-vinci n gly, but the semi-final match with LSE was undecided after extra time.\nIn the second round replay, against QM C. the team played magnificently to win 3-0\nThe goals were all scored in the second half\nby Anketell, Panesar and Sinclair, but credit must go to the whole team for a fine per-form ance. The semi-final, two days later, was against\nLSE who had the services of the University\nplayers Waggee and de Villier. LSE scored\nfirst when their right wing chased a ball,\nwhich the I.C. defence thought had gone out\nof play, and centred it across the empty goal.\nI.C. played well, especially in defence, but\ndid not quite show their spark of the previous match. I.C. equalise d just before half\ntime when Phillips converted a fine pass b v Anketell. The goal was greeted b v enthusiastic applause from five supporters who\npacked the duckboards on the touch line. Immediately after the interval Panesar put\n(.C. in the lead with a fine shot from a short\ncorner. The tempo of the match now reached\nfever pitch, but it was LSE who scrambled in\na goal after a short corner shot had been\nblocked by the I.C. goalkeeper. This was\nthe last goal of the match, twenty minutes of\nextra time which were packed with desperate\nattacks and heroic clar ances, could not decide\nthe issue. A draw was a very fair result and\nwe must wait for the replay to see whether\nI.C. will go forward to meet West Ham College in the final on March 7th.U.L. U. \u2014 ONE ACT PLAY FEST IV A LJ/t cannot be said that Imperial College\ntakes no notice at all of U.L.U.I. C. Provided two out of the four productions which\nwere entered for the competition and managed to win with John Webb's production of\nthe first act of \"Sleep of Prisoners\" by Christopher Fry.\nThe scenery and lighting combined well to\nsuggest the atmosphere of the ruined church\nwhich was a billet for four prisoners of war.\nThe play called for spirited acting from the\ntwo privates played by Tony Morey and\nBrian Connelly who played the murder scene\ntogether with intensity nearing hate. Chis\nMasterman as Cpl. Adams provided with the\ninjured Meadows (Edmundfield) the required balance of sympathy. One parti cula. ly good piece of collaboration between back\nand front-stage was the taped voice of God\nspoken by Meadows holding a conversation\nwith the private, King (Tony Morey). The\nAdjudicator was; looking for *a production\nwith pace besides the various other merits\nrequired. Occasionally, however, the speed\nand rhythm dropped (e.g. the dice game), but\noverall the play clicked \u2014 hence 1st prize\nand congratulations to John Webb.\nThe play written by David Cain as much\nconfused the programme printers with its\ntitle as it did the audience and the Adjudicator. \"Assevaration\" a solemn swearing. It\ndid not fit the play, but . . , ostensibly this\nwas the trial of Noah son of Laraech but was\nactually a vehicle for the various religious\nopinions of the author. The scene was a court-room: Perry Mason fans would have\nbeen disturbed \u2014- there was no defence law-yer, but there were two prosecuting counsels, one anti and the other in sympathy with\nthe believers. Witnesses were Noah, portrayed nobly by Simon Adlam, and a man\nand a woman (A. Ablewhite and Carol Melville) who wanted to- get back to bar and\nbaby-bathing respectively. These two parts\nwere played to show that \"I'm all right,\nJack\" is still predominant. Jenny Desmond\nwas extremely good as the probing cynical\nlawyer and Andrew McTier equally convincing as sym pathi sing counsel. Chris Tattersall\nwas an authoritative, un obstructive President\nof the Court. The actual meaning of the play\nwas pointed by R. Rushton who sat cross-leg-ged on the stage, smoking and tearing up\nthe \"Observer\" into minute pieces. Finally and\nsuperbly casually he tore up the notes taken\nby the lawyers. The play was produced b v the author who sensibly kept action to minimum and concentrated on the words allowing these to be stressed by the surrealist\nchorus.\nThe last performance of the evening was\nby the Adjudicator who summed up, wittily,\nexpansively \u2014 and with pace.\nBRIAN HOOPER\n\n"

The Proposition was\ngenerally well accepted \u2014 though many sc ep tics who did not know Mr. Jones too well appeared doubtful of his sanity. After obtaining a second er from the floor the Motion was\nput to the vote, assent being registered by\nraising one foot in the air, ladies present being requested to raise both feet.

Thus, in twelve or\nso playing weeks about twenty players have\nbeen lost.

    "content": "FELIX\nSI SCANS THE SCENE\nAbout this time of the year it is usual for\na student officer to sit down and write an\narticle yelling like mad how apathetic the\nstudents are. Well, I am not going to do that\nas I have been around universities or colleges\nlong enough to know that such an article accomplishes absolutely nothing. Besides I do\nnot feel that suggesting apathy this year is in\norder as I am sure that Thursday, November\n30th'61 must be a record as 1000 students\nattended the 3 union functions on that day.\nSo it is not student apathy that has made\nme sit down at the typewriter, but the feeling that there should be a link between the\nUnion Office and the readers of Felix. With\na little luck I should be able to write something for each issue. Last year we did a similar thing for the Carnival, a \"Hi from Si\"\ncolumn. However, it probably bored half the\nreaders. I am sure that this column will even\nbe worse off as we can hardly use last year's opening comment, \"Well, the carnival progress looks as though it jumped up on its horse\nand galloped off in all directions.\", and then\nproceed with some humour. Not that humour\ndoes not have its place in the Union, but\nfrom the Felix point of view we will leave that\nup to the carnival. Although at times we\nmight use the quotation above with \"carnival\nprogress\" replaced by \"Union\".\nThis week I will not try to establish the\nlink by discussing what is going on, but rather\nwhat I would like to see existing at the College. Firstly, what I would like to see changed\nis the negative, or let's do nothing attitude\nthat is all too obvious here. A student is\nat the College for only 3 years, during which\ntime he has to transform from a school boy\nto a man capable to take responsibility in\nhis first permanent employment. Thus he\nshould be in an atmosphere of activity, of\nexperimentation, of questioning, to see if\nwhat he is doing can be done in a different\nand possibly better way. This is the time for\nthe student to run ti is organisations with\nboldness, almost daring ness to explore the\nuntried. If it fails he will still have learned\nand he will have done so in an organisation\nwhere the effect both on it and on himself\nare not permanent due to the transient membership of a students union. JJ he does not\ntry this he will never have the chance once\nhe is in the more rigorous society of industry.\nSo what are the experiments? Well, here\nare a few.\nPUBLICATIONS FELIX1. Printed once a week to improve news\ncoverage.\n2. Printed internally to reduce cost and to\nmake it possible to introduce colour.\n3. Subscriptions paid by all union members of 1 penny per issue, resulting in distribution to all students and staff once a week.\n4. Operate an active advertising board to\nencourage companies to use Felix as an advertising medium, thus reducing our costs of\npublication.\nSCRUTINY \u2014 PHOENIX1. Combined and published at least once\na term.\n2. Two seperate boards, two editors operating independently of each other except for\nthe actual printing. This would improve the\nstandard of presentation of the present\nScrutiny and at the same time make the combined publication financially independent.\nHUMOUR MAGAZINE1. To add some light hearted reading to\nthe list of publications available.\n2. Could be used by the Carnival as their\npublication in the summer term, thus the publication could be the union's link with the\nCarnival throughout the year.\nSTUDENT ACTIVITIES\nAt the present time the clubs and societies represented by the Social, Recreational\nand Athletics club committees are well supported and each is functioning extremely well.\nHowever, this does not mean that improvement is not possible as these could do more\nto spread their influence outside of their own\nmembership. The S. G.G could do this by\nstaging model House of 'Commons debates\nmonthly and by organising a model United\nNations once a year. The R.C. C. clubs could\ngear their competitions to involve more stud-ents, land the non-com petit ii ve clubs could\nhave exhibitions, etc. The A.C.C. teams are\nobviously in a slightly different position. The\npossibility of extending their number of participants is very closely limited by both facilities and the number of students prepared to\nplay regularly for their team. However, most\nof these clubs want spectators at their major\ngames, and it is in this activity that these\nclubs could do more. If the field at Harlington was better equipped for spectators, and\nthe spectators were offered more for their ef-forts; such as a social evening to follow ei the i at Harlington, or the Union, then more people\nwould take an interest in these games. (I suggest that even without th le is e arrangements\nyou should take an active interest in these\ngames as the I.C. teams are of very high\nstandard and are very deserving of your support in the University competitions.)\nSTUDENT PARTICIPATION All of the things I have mentioned above\nrequire more work than is presently done,\nand most of the work is of the \"behind the\nscenes type\" which always seems like a thankless task. Thus we need a scheme to\nencourage people to do more for their Union.\nThis can be done in two ways. Both by the\nextension of the Union General Award and\nthe establishment of an I.C. Honours Society.\nAWARDS1. Three grades of awards, for the lack of\nbetter names, Gold (Union General Award).\nSilver, and Bronze.\n2. Award recipients nominated by the\nstudent body and the election by an Award\nCommittee.\nHONOUR SOCIETY1. Membership open to award winners on-ly-2. Act as the College's official representatives at all social gatherings.\n3. Act as an advisory board to assist stud-ents.\nSTUDENT STAFF RELATIONSHIP This undoubtedly is the most important\nmatter for the students to consider. Student\nstaff relationship can be in two spheres of\nactivities, outside of their academic associa t ion, social and teaching methods. The relationships socially are usually limited by the\namount of time either party has available,\nor by the personalities involved. However,\nthis is an important aspect and requires continual developing. Teaching Methods on the\nother hand provide a common ground for\nthe students and staff as naturally both are\nconcerned in the techniques available and\n'their applications. Many Unions, particularly on the continent, have clubs within their\nUnion working in co-operation with various\ndepartments in the college investigating\nteaching aids. The Union in each case takes\nan active part to help financially to acquire\nthe necessary equipment and the clubs and\ndepartments analyze its effects on the lecture.\nIn this way they are taking a serious interest\nin how they are being taught and at the same\ntime working closely with the staff. The same\ncould be done here as the field of teaching aids\nis only starting, and many clubs could within their present set-up find many aspects of\nthis problem worth considering. For ex-ample, the Radio Club could investigate the\nfeasibility of clo feed circuit television as a teaching aid. There are numerous such ex-ample s, and if you stop and think about it you\nwill see that the knowledge gained by the\nindividuals in the club and the worth of their\nefforts are only limited by the imagination\nof the clubs themselves.\nCONCLUSION I have not churned out these ideas just because I had nothing better to do with my\nSunday afternoon, but because I feel that\nthese are a few of the things a student body\nshould be working towards if it really wants\nto build a Union for itself which is of significance not only to the individual but also\nto the College.\nThese ideas are personal, not official. They\nwil be shot down by the usual reaction air ies, but I hear their views all the time, so THIS\nTIME \u2014 i WANT TO HEAR YOUR VIEWS.\nI.C.

    "content": "Debut of the MC Friction Group\nThe Guilds Union Meeting held on Thursday February 9th was not quite up to the\nhigh standard set by the previous two (on-ly three eggs reached the executive), but it\nwas notable for the debut of a small close-discord group, composed c*f\"S' s from Dr.\nCameron's lab., in the rat-in feb tt i cellars of\nthe old Guilds Building. Calling themselves\nthe I.C. Friction Group, these gentlemen rendered a few irreverent ditties on the subject\nof higher degrees, accompanying themselves\non the tape recorder, and their efforts were!\nappreciated by the Union who burst into ap-,\npla use long before the performance was en-1\nded. The spiritual leader of the group, Mr.,\nHingley, also diverted the Union with a1 sample of the letters reaching the Ministry,\nof Pensions and National Insurance, for ex-i ample, \"Please send me some money as I have been in bed with the doctor for a week\nand it's not doing me any good.\" These were\nappreciated even more and Mr. Hingley and\nCo. are to be congratulated on their efforts\nto edify the Union.\nThe more routine business of the meeting included reports on the Swimming Gala,\nthe Engineer's Dinner-Dance. Regarding the\nfirst, the President said that it was hoped\nto reimburse up to half of the fines incurred\nby members of the Union and the Ends,\nChairman, ChrJs Liddle was congratulated\non an extremely fine Dinner-Dance. The final details for the Sports Sunday were announced and members were exhorted'', to attend the Guilds-Mines Carnival which is on\nthe Ides of March. The President revealed\nthat the President of Mines, John Fairfield,\nwas to be married on the following Saturday, and asked the Union to supply a suitable message for the occasion. A short, pithy\nmessage was suggested and a proved, though\nthe female members of the Union had some\ndifficulty in pretending not to know what it\nmeant.\nThe President tried to get the Union interested in changing the emphasis of the\nGuilds Engineer but he had little success.\nMr. Pete Airey asked for the resignation of\nthe President on the grounds that the I.C. Executive had refused to allow second year\nElectricals to hold a Carnival in the Concert Hall. Although assured that the other\nmembers of the Executive would be forced\nto resign also, Laurie Austin declined to give\nup his post and no one seemed to be interested in whether he did or not Finally, a gentleman who has been identified and put\non the Felix extermination list, asked why\nFelix was so dead. The Editor informed him\nthat Felix was in this state because the questioner was not doing anything to change this.\nThe meeting was closed with a Boomalacka\nand a crash of glass.\nCrossword\nby RE GUS CLUES: ACROSS.\n1.

He was driven to a small garage in\nPutney where he was jacked up and his wheel\nbearings examined. For the rest of the test\n\u2014 \"Well you stopped when you came in so\nyour brakes must' be all right\", \"Lamps seem\nto have oil in so they must work\", and the\nannual \"Just have a look at the play in the\nsteering\" satisfied the other requirements.\nThus armed with his certificate of road\nworthiness (but no road tax) Bo took the\nPresident to Harlington on Sports Day in\nrecord time (and brought the Editor of Felix back).\nHis next outing will be to bring to the\nUnion John V.
