    "content": "FELIX\nRORY REDMAYNE\nPARKING OR RATHER\nNOT PARKING\nDespite protests from all and sundry, not least the College\nauthorities, the Westminster City Council (W. C.C.) has decided that\nparking meters should be introduced by January next year throughout\ntheir area\u2014including all the College environs north of Imperial Institute Road. This of course raises immediate problems for members\nof IC for whom even now parking is difficult.\nThe current demand for parking\nbays at College seems to amount\nto 650 non-resident College\nmembers and 150-200 residents\nwho own cars and keep them at\nIC. In College controlled areas\nthere are only 400 parking\nspaces. Clearly a\" free-for-all \"\nin the use of these spaces is impractical because of the uncertainty of finding a space, having\nalready brought one's car into\ntown. Therefore the Parking\nCommittee has recently been\ngiving its attention to the problem of fair allocation. This body\nis one of the Rector's committees\nand has a student representation\nof two. It has, I understand, put\na number of proposals to the\nRector for establishing a system\nfor parking allocation.\nSTUDENTS MOST\nVULNERABLE\nAs far as this issue goes, the\nslu der* s are undoubtedly the\nmost i lner able group concerned,\nhaving neither the prestige of the\nstaff nor the militant union of\nthe technicians. We must therefore await the Rector's decision.\nOf the 400 College bays a number must clearly be set aside for\nessential car users \u2014 disabled\npeople, college vehicles and Professorial staff, and so on. Beyond this however, the fairest\nsystem of allocation would be to\nselect from a joint pool of commuter staff and students, according to their need. In this way,\nalthough the percentage of parking spaces for students would\nprobably not compare favourably\nwith that for staff .there would at\nleast be spaces for essential users\nsuch as union officials, Felix staff\nand those whose journey to college is particularly difficult by\nnub li c transport.\nEXPENSIVE\nIn order to make best use of\nthe available space I think\nthat few bays should be allocated in college areas for residents because the W. C.C. has\nagreed that people in hall may\nregister as residents of Westminster after the first month of each\nsession, thus entitling them to\nmetered parking space at 2/6 a day, which is very favourable\ncompared to the 1/- an hour for\ncommuters. If the college authorities feel that resident staff\nhave a case for cheaper parking\nby virtue of their hall suite being\ntheir home then surely it is\nworthwhile for them to sub sid is e their residents' parking facilities\nin order to keep vacant college\nbays for commuters, for whom\nstreet parking will be so ex pen sive.\nCOLLEGE TO HIRE SPACES?\nFurther, I wonder if it is possible for the college to permanently hire from the W. C.C. certain metered bays (at the normal\ncommuter rate) so that those who\nthink it worth while to come by\ncar may have the certainty of a street bay which they could hire\nsession ly or termly from the col-leg e. COMMEMORATION DAY\nThe Special Visitor at this\nyear's Commemoration Day will\nbe the Rt. Hon. Lord Kings\nNorton, PhD, DIC, DSc,\nMlMechE, FRAeS, FInstF,\nFIAeS, Fellow of Imperial College.\nLord Kings Norton was a student in the Department of\nAeronautical Engineering from\n1922 until 1926, receiving his\nPhD and DIC in 1926. From\n1931-39 he was special lecturer in\nthe same department, on the subject of \" Structure and Strength\nOf Aircraft.\"\nThe timetable for Commemoration Day includes an inter-de-nomination al service in Holy\nTrinity Church, Prince Consort\nRoad, conducted by the Rev D.W Cleverly Ford, with a sermon\nby the Rev. Dr A. Marcus Ward\nof Richmond College. At the\nceremony in the Royal Albert\nHall, the Diploma of membership\nof the Imperial College will be\npresented to Lady Linstead. and\nthe following newly elected Fellows will be presented to the\nChairman of the Governing Body:\nProfessor PM.S. Blackett\nSir Charles Goodeve\nProfessor Sir Ewart Jones\nProfessor WH. McCrea\nDr. G.H. Mitchell\nMr. J. Newby\nAfterwards Lord Kings Norton\nwill give his Address. In the\nevening work and buildings of the\nCity & Guilds buildings will be\non view to visitors.\nC00M MEM0 RAT I0N DAY BALL: See Page 1\nROVER CREW IN ICELAND\nWhatever system is employed\nthe fact remains that the supply/\ndemand ratio is greater than 1 : 2\nfor bays in college and so inevitably half the present car users\nwill have to pay or not park. I fear that students will have to\naccept that we will probably be\nworst hit and so plan accordingly.\nNordusjokull Torfajokull\nThe steaming edge of the\ncrater of Helka, as now capped volcano, was one of the more\nspectacular camping sites of the\nI.C Rover Crew expedition to\nIceland.\nThe others were rather more\nsedate affairs, but nevertheless the\ncrew managed to get its fair share\nof exercise and adventure. Twelve\nmembers sailed to Iceland last\nholiday armed with,a minibus.\nThey set up a base in Reykjavik\nand then drove to Landmannerlavger via a long and perilous\nroute. Having successfully overcome the hazards of lava fields,\nsoft sand, mud and wide rivers,\nthe crew camped upon their crater\nand from there climbed such\npeaks as Kaldaksfjoll, and crossed\nthe icecap of Torfajokull. They\nthen moved on to Karkingerfjoll\nand climbed Snaekollir and Nordirsjokull and other well-known\nIcelandic peaks, making full use\nof the 24-hour Icelandic daylight.\nThe meet ended in traditional\nstyle with\u2014what else ?\u2014a mighty\ndrinking session.\nROOM\nTO\nGROW\nProcter & Gamble place great emphasis on early\npersonal growth.\nWe provide both the room to grow, and a place to\ngrow into as soon as capability is demonstrated.\nIn this manner we provide a constant opportunity for\nyoung people to match their developing abilities with\nmore challenging assignments.\nRoom to grow a priceless ingredient in the building\nof a career!\nPlease consult yot ir Appointments Board.\nProcter & Gamble\nOIS COUNT ON\nALL NEW ENGINEERING\nDRAWING EQUIPMENT\nWRITE:\nConnectors and Electronics Ltd.\n20 College Drive Ruislip\nOR PHONE:\n713 - 5 9 5 3\nSEE UNION PERSONAL NOTICE\nBOARD FOR DETAILS\n\n"

    "content": "6 FELIX\nTHE LONDON SCENE\nNo matter what kind ot interests you may have, kinky or straight,\nyou can indulge them in London. London would take a lifetime to\nget to know in any full sense of (he word, but here are a few ideas\nfor starters.\nYou like beer? \" The Bird in Hand \" on Rosslyn Hill in Hampstead serves an excellent jar of bitter You like style? South\nKensington has some stylish pubs, but the beer tends to be well-nigh\nun drinkable. A notable exception is \" The Hoop and Toy \" just up\nfrom South Kensington Tube Station. Good beer and beautiful people\nare to be found in any number of Chelsea pubs if you're willing to pay\nfor them.\nFor atmosphere and ort-beat\ncharacters \" The Duke of Wellington \" in Portobello Road is\nhard to beat; while you're there,\ntry Henekey's, one block up the\nroad. You could meet anyone\nI BcE5 Join the I.C.T. W.C.( Tiddley-winks Club). Become an I.C. anarchist or Trotskyist or Young\nConservative. Support Dramsoc\nor SocSoc or SickSoc.\nIn all their cries for attention\nat the beginning of the year one\nof our greatest assets as a University is often ignored \u2014 our\nposition in the centre of London\n\u2014a city which will excite and\ndepress, infuriate or stimulate.\nWhether that stimulus be birds\nor music ; whether you want to\nlead the life of a hippie or a sober\nclerk or a drunkard it's here in\n\"the smoke.\"\nMartin Walker here gives a subjective look at London.\nfrom slumming West-ender s to a biochemist collecting semen\nsamples in test tubes. Notting\nHill Gate has some good pubs\ntoo: the basement of \"The Swan\"\nat the top end of Kensington\nChurch St. is gently swinging with\noriginal decor, juke box and nice\nbar girls. \"The Leinster\" in Leinster Square is an excellent local\npub complete with coal fire, darts,\nmus sells and shrimps, the regulars\u2014and good beer. The West\nEnd abounds in pubs of all sorts,\nbut if you come out of a theatre\nnear Piccadilly Circus at ten to\neleven with a powerful thirst, try\n\" Ward's Irish House\" on the\nnorth side; beware St. Patrick's Day\nIf you are a culture-vulture,\nLondon is unbeatable. It is worth\nyour while getting programmes of\nfuture events at the Wigmorc\nHall. Allien Hall. 1'cst i val Hall,\nand Covent Garden. There arc\ninnumerable films of course, and\nlive theatre , Cognoscenti from\nNew York say that progressive\nstaging has died in London, but\nthere is nevertheless a lot of\nacting talent here, and a play is\nworth what it will cost you.\nDon't forget the art galleries\nand museums; they are good for\nmany a Sunday afternoon, and\nthey are free. If it's the underground scene that grabs you\u2014\nand I don't mean yo-yo ing on the\nL.T. C. \u2014there are \" The Arts Laboratory\" at 182 Drury Lane, and\n\" U.F.O.\" at the Roundhouse,\nChalk Farm. The Arts Lab.\ncomprises an art gallery, bistro,\nbar, and small theatre where\nunderground \u2014 and uncensored\nfilms are shown. Students can join\nfor \u00a31 and it is well worth it.\n\" U.F.O.\" is the Hippy scene and\nmanages to retain ascendency\nover its numerous smaller rivals\ndespite infiltration by tourists and\nteeny-bopper s. Here music is the\nthing, and \" U.F.O.\" gets very\ngood groups indeed. It runs from\n10.30 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. Fridays.\nFlower sheila s abound; not all are\nuntouchable.\nI.C. is notable for its lack of\nwomen, but do not despair, London is not. The Royal College\nof Art has reputedly very good\ndances and definitely has lots of\ntalent. There are more hops than\nyou can comfortably shake a stick\nat, notably at L.S.E. If all else\nfails, try one or more of the\nseveral computer dating schemes.\nThey are unlikely to find you the\nlove of your life, but one of your\ndates is bound to shape if you've\nan ounce of talent. And at \u00a31 it's cheaper than French lessons.\nSo much for entertainment, it\nyou just want something to do,\ninteresting, different, but free, try\nwalking around Soho on a Friday\nor Saturday night from 8.00 or\n9.00 p.m. onwards. It is a fascinating place, and there is very\nmuch more than ageing strippers\nand second floor massage. In\nfact, generally speaking now, it is\ninteresting to sav our the flavours\nof different areas in London.\nHampstead Village for example is\nquaint, olde world e and very arty-crafty Paddington is tough and\nugly Notting Hill is on the way\nup and one sees, but never seems\nto meet, incredibly gorgeous birds\nwandering about\u2014try Mac Fisheries on Saturday. South Kensington is different again, and Chelsea\n\u2014a smarter, wealthier Hampstead. If you aspire to the\nswitched on swinging London\nscene of Time, Inc. try the King's Road. It's expensive, and people\nspend all of their time looking at\neach other, and nobody will look\nat you unless you have a crotch-length skirt or are a pop star, but\nit's amusing nevertheless. To get\ndeeper into London, it is essential\nto visit at least some of London's many markets. Here you will find\nthe surviving genuine Londoners,\na vanishing breed of men, generous and warm with a repartee\nthat will leave your head spinning.\nTry Billingsgate at 5.00 a.m. on a weekday morning. Shepherd's Bush or Portobello Road on\nSaturday The latter is a favourite Hippy hangout perhaps because of the bells, bangles and\nbeads to be found there. It is\ninteresting to visit the market in\nthe afternoon and the pubs in the\nevening; the people arc quite\ndifferent- day people and night\npeople.\nThen there are the parks. They\ntoo have their own unique characters, from the vastness of Hyde\nPark to the prettiness of Berkeley\nSquare or the formal gardens of\nRegent's Park. It is worthwhile\nlooking at all of them; they arc ail\nwithin easy reach, and are a balm\nto a blown mind or a broken\nheart.\nFor acad a emi a outside I.C it\nis worth mentioning that London\nhouses some of the world's best\nlibraries. Near to l.C. is the\nScience Museum Library which\nall I.C. students can join, gratis\nit has marvellously obscure journals on topics you've never heard\nof. There are Senate House, and\nnearby University College Libraries; both are excellent. You\nare unlikely to need it, but if you\ndo, there's the British Museum.\nIf you prefer to buy your books,\nthe best bookshops are probably\nDillon's near Senate House,\nLewises across the road from\nU.C. Hospital, and Claude Ciill\non Oxford St. opposite Selfridgcs.\nFor the way-out try Indica\nBooks, it has Zen Macrobiotics,\njust in case you didn't know\nBy the way, I.C. runs Touchstone weekends at the College\nfield station near Ascot, so if you\nget fed up to the teeth with London's incessant noise and inescapable exhaust fumes, by all means\nget out.\nMARTIN WALKER\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE\nCOMMIT'\"\" DAY\nThursday 26 October\nRoyal Albert Hall\n3pm Commemoration Day celebrates the visit to the College in 1945 of the late\nKing George VI, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother\u2014now Chancellor of the University of London\u2014at the centenary of the Royal College of\nChemistry, the oldest forerunner of the Imperial College.\nThis year's celebration will be held on Thursday, 26th October, in the Royal\nAlbert Hall at 3 p.m> The special visitor will be the Rt.

    "content": "FELIX5 Ray Phillips: the full story Ray Phillips, ebullient President of I.C. Union, has provided\nFELIX with its first scoop of the year by revealing hitherto unsuspected facts about his formative years, both in and out of I.C. Born in 1945 (just too late io win the war single-handed) in\nCarshalton, he lived and learned in Suburbia. At the tender age of\nthirteen, however, he was exported to Hampshire to complete his\nso-called education at Barton Reveril Grammar School, Eastleigh.\nThere his activities ranged far; he sang the part of the sergeant\nof police in Gilbert and Sullivan's\" Pirates of Penzance\" and\ndeveloped prowess in the fields which was later to earn his reputation\nat I.C. He played hockey (for Hants County Schools team) and cricket.\nIn 1963, having obtained an\nentrance scholarship, he arrived\nat I.C. to read Chemistry. He was\nfortunate in entering Beit Hall\nbut the rest of his first year is\ncovered in silence; the law of\nlibel forbids speculation on this\ntopic.\nIn his second year Ray Phillips\ntook his first Union posts as Treasurer of I.C. Hockey Club and\nChemistry second year representative. Despite these laudable attempts he did not gain read mis sion to Beit and had to commute\nfrom the depths of darkest Fulham. However in his third year\nhe returned to the campus once\nmore as Captain of I.C. Hockey\nClub. He retained his connection\nwith R.C.S. by representing them\non the Athletic Grounds Committee. He further entrenched\nhimself in the corridors of power\nby serving on Beit Hall committee\nand later the selection committee.\nThese activities did not disturb\nthe balance he had struck sufficiently to prevent him gaining an\nUpper Second degree which enabled him to return to do research\nin the Chemistry department with\na view to eventually obtaining a PhD.\nHis first year PG was combined\nwith the Chairmanship of the\nAthletic Clubs Committee into\nwhich he introduced what he,\nwith uncharacteristic modesty,\ndescribes as \" startling reforms.\"\nHe continued to play hockey, this\ntime for the University of London\nUnion. As a result of his chairmanship he obtained a third year\nin Hall, this time deserting Beit\nfor Tizard.\nThis then is the President of\nI.C. Union. He wants \" a fair\ncrack of the whip for students \"\nand is going \" to attempt to involve apathetic students by better\nadvertising\" and wants to remove\nthe main cause of anti-union feeling by revising the attitudes of\nUnion officers.\nThe Phoenix\narises\nonce\nmore\nDespite a slight setback during\nthe Summer Vac, the financial\nprospects of THE PHOENIX are\nbrighter than they have been for\ntwo years. Response to advertising circulars sent to all major\nindustrial companies shows a considerable interest on their\npart in publishing two editions\nthis year. (In recent years it has\nbeen usual to publish two editions but last year delays in the\nproduction of the first edition\nprecluded a second.) It is also\nhoped to reduce the high production costs by adopting a different\nmethod of printing.\nVaried material needed A major feature of the first edi tion will be a group of articles\nalready commissioned on various\naspects of solitude and loneliness.\nMore articles on other subjects\nare still required, however, to ensure a good balance of content.\nPoems and short stories are also\nrequired. It is hoped to make\ngreater use of photographs than\nin the past, as well as line and\nhalf-tone drawings. Editor Colin\nHarrison said recently \"I should\nlike it to be felt that this magazine\nis produced by people throughout\nthe Union and not by a small\ngroup as must be the case with\nFELIX.\" To make possible the\ncorrect preparation of copy for\nthe printers, articles, poems,\nstories, photographs, drawings\nand ideas are required as soon as\npossible, at the latest by October\n31st. They may be left, addressed\nto The Phoenix, in the Felix rack\nin the Union or delivered to\nRoom 94, New Beit.\nCity & Guilds\nCollege\nOpen Day\nThe recently completed City &\nGuilds building will be open to\nthe public on 26th October 1967.\nThis includes the Departments of\nAeronautics, Chemical Engineering & Chemical Technology,\nCivil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. The College will be open\nfrom 2.30 to 7.30 p.m. COLCUTT\nColcutt was a builder, he constructed a tower, a tall tower,\nsince demolished, from which to\nview the Imperial scene. For\nmany a year Colcutts have surveyed the scene from this lofty\ncolumn. It is often a lonely point\nof view and the column is frequently reviled as a foul misconstruction. I address these words to the\nmass of innocent Freshmen lest\nthey fear that no one cares. Colcutt cares! The few remaining\nsecond and third year students are\nwell aware of Colcutt's activities\n(if not his name). Which brings\nme to my first point, gentlemen.\nIt is now a commonplace to remark the decreased number of 6th Formers who decide to read\nscience or technology; we read\nfrequently of the numbers of vacant places in Physics or Civil\nEngineering at this or that university. Yet curiously the intake into\nthis College increases as ever.\nEven more curiously the increase\nin the number of graduates from\nsome departments rises less\nsteeply than the intake. Curious\ntoo that although the first year\nPhysics intake is around the 200\nmark, there are only 180 places\nin the second year laboratories.\nIs it fair (or right) to condemn\n20 students (who 'have worked\nhard to get here) before they see\na problem sheet? Consider further that last year's third year\nPhysics lectures were given in\ntheatres capable of seating 120.\nTo gain entrance to a university\na student must be among the top\nfour percent of this country's brain-power. Is it good sense to\ndecree that 10, 20 or 30 of these\nentrants are only good to be\npruned away and thrown on the\nrubbish heap in order that Imperial College may have a reputation for producing only top quality graduates? Perhaps our new,\nthough tardy, Rector can reassure\nus on this matter.\nObstruction it is well known thai copies ot\ntren x ao not give go ou protection\nagainst the coi ui^ on u u ii iN igm s. for mos e ot you w no are nu u ui eu on tnc di ioa ii km eius, l recon i menu that you gainer as many\ncopies ot bennet as you re qu nc( it sr Kt tio ik s:!) and uist nou ict ne thick heavy, woolly pages\nao out your shivering to irn.

    "content": "4. FELIX\nEDITOR'S Uomment\nTHE YEAR AHEAD\nOur Union grows more powerful each year and correspondingly\nthe volume of work facing the Executive increases. In the past the\nUnion leaders have frequently been \" good lad \" leading the social\nlife of the Union and too frequently have drifted away from one of\ntheir main tasks\u2014the representation of I.C student opinion. This\nyer rI.C. U. faces several challenges, through which it is the duty of\nthe Executive to guide and represent the average student with unremitting energy\nProbably one of the most vital of these challenges is student\nresidential accommodation. Last year Council accepted a proposal for\nthe purchase and development of \" Student Houses \" -fraternity-like\nresidences run for and by the students. The capital expenditure is\nlarge as the intention is to purchase houses in the expensive vicinity of\nI.C. Loans are being negotiated at present. Obstacles will inevitably\noccur. It is to be hoped, however, that the Executive will never allow\nthis exceptional scheme to lag or fade. \" Student Houses \" could in\nthe not too distant future become the mainstay of accommodation for\nI.C. students and provide a much needed larger residential atmosphere to the College.\nPOSTGRADUATE GRANTS\nRemaining in the held of student welfare, the problem of postgraduate grants in London has arisen. The Association of Scientific\nWorkers (to which all students may gain membership) has approached\nthe S. R.C. with the aim of obtaining a London allowance of \u00a370 to\nsupplement postgraduate grants. Postgraduates (capable of earning\nvery reasonable salaries in industry) receive a pittance from the S. R.C. of \u00a3500. With the cost of living in London and short holidays\n(inhibiting the earning of additional money) the London PG is in a very poor financial position. Here the Executive can lend their\ncon 'e te support in backing the Association of Scientific Workers or\nin p,.v i ding a fresh initiative.\nCARNIVAL\nFacing the Executive in the immediate future is the task of getting\nCarnival under way Last year's Carnival was a record-breaking\nsuccess netting \u00a33,500. This year we must again surpass the efforts\nof the past, for a College of our size should be able to achieve profits\napproaching \u00a310,000. Jerry Stockbridge, last year's Carnival co-or d in at or, stated that it was crucial to eke the maximum effort out of\nthe firstterm, when exams remained over the horizon and people were\nfresh. A Carnival Co-or d in at or and Committee still have to be\nselected to organise and whip up enthusiasm quickly\nA lot of hard work lies ahead of the Executive. It is to be hoped\nan early start is made on these problems.\nWELCOME TO FRESHERS\nIn this first issue of the year Felix takes the opportunity of\nwelcoming all Freshers to the College. No doubt many freshmen are\nbewildered and jaded by the incessant demands to join this or that or\nthe other society While some dynamic characters will by now be\nmembers of perhaps twenty clubs or societies (perhaps too hopeful of\nthe equation of time and work), others will not have got around so\nmuch. It is not worthwhile to preach here on student apathy, which\nis not limited to this College but occurs among all students. It is up\nto each person to decide his own way of life, though he who puts the\nmost into student and Union life will gain the most out of it. For most\nof us, we remain students for only a very short three years. Those three\nyears are worth making the most of and only through a communion\nwith other students can one make those three years truly unique.\nImperial College\nLondon, S.W.7 Internal 2881\nTel.

This arbitrary decision by the Government provoked wide rebellion in British academic life.\nNo purpose will be i erve d by re-opening the issue of overseas\nstudents' fees, though, it seems, one has yet to see the end of the\nmatter. What the ultimate outcome will be of the admirable stand of\nOxford, Cambridge and some other universities in refusing to abide\nby the government directive still remains to be seen. However, amidst\nall the arguments and counter-arguments there was a tendency to\nbelieve that overseas students\u2014those leftists from Berkeley! \u2014were\nthe cause of much trouble. What was not recognised was that if\noverseas students did take part in various protests, as indeed they did,\nit was because they were an integral part of the entire student\ncommunity\nIt is, however, true that overseas students face many problems\non their arrival and even after-wards. Many find life in this\ncountry rather different from what\nthey are accustomed to and conditions in some respects are not\nquite good enough to make everybody feel at home. But it would\nbe a reflection on the intelligence\nof the student if I were to suggest\nthat he does not find his way\naround quite quickly. Nevertheless it is true that there is an initial lack of communication. Overcoming this is not always easy and\nneeds an effort on the part of both\nold and new students. It is, there-Published by D.E. Potter for and on behalf of FELIX BOARD\nImperial College, London, S.W.7. and printed by WEST LONDON\nOFFSET CO.. 86, Liliie Rd., London, S.W.6. Tel.: FUL 7969\nActivities\nThis is the most important\nthing an overseas student should\nalways bear in mind. In our College there are 800 overseas stu-dents. If they remain isolated\nfrom the mainstream of activities\nin the College the whole purpose\nof travelling thousands of miles to\ncome here will be lost. While\nstudy and research are of paramount importance it is at the\nsame tune worthwhile to take part\nin at least some of the exciting\nthings that are happening in and\naround the College. With students from almost all corners of\nthe globe we have an excellent\nopportunity to understand the\nproblems others are facing and\nonly on the basis of such mutual\nunderstanding can the international com muni y ever hope to\nlive in peace.\nfore, hopeful that the Union is\nstriving to improve the situation\nthrough the newly-formed Overseas Students' Committee. With\nthe most active co-operation of\nthe International Relations Club\nand the various national societies\na Reception Centre has been\nopened in the Union where a number of present students of the\nCollege are ready to meet the\nnewcomers. The object is not\nnecessarily to offer ready-made\nsolutions to the problems of the\nnew student but to provide the\nearliest opportunity to make\nfriends in informal surroundings.\nThe Centre will remain open till\nFriday and I urge those who have\nnot already done so\u2014whether or\nnot they have any particular\nproblem\u2014to pay a visit.\nNITIN SOM\nScene\nPage\nseven #\nNITIN SOM\nNitin Som was Vice-Chairman\nof the International Relations\nClub for the last two years and\nis now the Chairman of the\nUnion Overseas Students Committee. He is also Vice-President\nof the national United Nations\nStudents Association.\nThen as Now?\nIn 1934 H.G. Wells wrote of\nImperial College :\nIt is today a huge fung oid assemblage of buildings and schools\nwithout a visible centre, guiding\npurpose or directive brain. It has\nbecome a constituent of the still\nvaster, still more conspicuously\na cephalic monster, the University\nof London.\nThe thumbs y wisdom of the\npractical man, with a conception\nof life based on immediate needs,\nun analysed motives and headlong\nassumptions, and with an innate\nfear of free and searching thought,\nis still manifest at a hundred\npoints in the structure and working of this great aggregation.\nThe struggle to blend technical\nequipments with a carefully\ncherished illiteracy, an intact oaf-ish ness about fundamental things,\nhas been well sustained. South\nKensington will still tell you\nproudly, \" We are not literary,\"\nand explain almost anxiously that\nthe last thing it wants to impart\nis a liberal education.\nThe ideal output of the Imperial College remains a swarm of\nmechanical, electrical and chemical business smart ies, guaranteed\nto have no capacity for social\nleadership, constructive combination or original thought.\nThe Imperial College was and\nis still in fact not a college but a sprawl of laboratories and class-rooms. Whatever ideas of purpose wrestled together in its beginnings are now forgotten.\nIt has no firm idea of what it is\nand what it is supposed to do.\nThat is to say, it has no philo-soph y. It has no philosophical\norganisation, no social idea, no\nrat ionised goal, to hold it together.\nI had come up to South Kensington persuaded that I should\nlearn everything. I found myself\nin South Kensington lost and dismayed at the multitudinous in consecutive ness of everything.\nIf somebody did something\nA letter to the President:\nSir,\nHow about a little action here?\nI mean, damn it, I am appalled at\neverything. I really must protest.\nJust look around you for God's sake. Why doesn't somebody do\nsomething? I mean if somebody\ndid something we might get some-where.\nWell, just look at what everybody is saying this year, and last\nyear, and they are saying it every-where. Everybody's so damn\napathetic. In FELIX they wrote\nlast year :\n\" Despite any appearance to\nthe contrary that may be interpreted from our pages during the\nyear, far too many Union clubs\nand societies are \" sick \" through\nlack of support. It has been said\nthat at least half of the students\nat I.C. take no part in the Union\nother than to obtain their midday\nmeal \"\nWell, this is just not good\nenough. Let's get these clubs and\nsocieties moving. And SENNET\nsaid :\n\" It is only by casting his mite\ninto the fund of communal contribution to Union Activity that\nUniversity life, in the form of\nsocieties, clubs, sports teams etc.\ncan exist at all. Students of London University too often make the\nmis lake of owing allegiance solely\nto their College to the detriment\nof course to the University as a whole.\n\" When numbers are so large\nand the component parts of the\nUniversity are so spread out and\noften far removed from each\nother, it is only too easy for the\nstudent to lead a hermit's social\nlife in his own College Union and\nturn his back on the rest of the\nUniversity.\"\nThat's not good enough. You\nsee, if we get this show on the\nroad and something moves, well\nthen, the President would have a real organisation to preside over\u2014\nyou know, something to do. Ana\nthe Secretary would have somebody to write to. And the Editor\nof this paper would have something to edit. Things would be on\nthe move.\nSo lets have some original happenings and things this year. You\nknow this Carnival jazz and\nUnion meetings and so on has\nfallen out of the groove. I mean\npeople get bored with this year in,\nyear out. So how about something\nnew Like a happening with the\nstaff and Rector and all that\u2014like\nat L.S.E. last year I mean. Well,\ngive it to those fellows\u2014at least\nthey got a bit of action out of it.\nOr how about a Red Guards\njob. You know, some real student involvement in the problems\nof the community We could have\nminor battles with reactionary\nworkers and dunces caps for revisionists and things . . .\nWell anyway something. I mean, get with it.\nSomebody please do something.\n\n"

London\nAllowance for S. R.C. supported\npostgraduates. This was decided\nat a meeting of Physics P.G.' s on\n12th July, organised by the I.C. branch of the Association of\nScientific Workers. The meeting\nalso agreed to ask for the earnings limit to be raised. It is expected that meetings in Chemistry and Guilds will also endorse\nthese demands.\nJ.G. Wilson was elected PhyPostgrads ask\nsics representative on the de lega tion, which will be led by\nA. Sc.W branch secretary H. Fairbrother, a lecturer in the\nMaths, department.\nMr. Fairbrother opened the\nmeeting with an account of the\nhistory of negotiations with the\nD. S.I.R.( Dept. of Scientific and\nIndustrial Research) and the\nS. R.C. since 1962, when the\nP.G.' s London allowance of \u00a360\nwas abolished. He also pointed\nout that undergraduate students,\nlecturers and technicians all. receive a London allowance, and so\ndo the Civil Servants who decided that P.G. s could do with-out.., In fact the P.G. now gets\nless, per week spent at College,\nthan an undergraduate. The\nA. Sc.W has produced a document giving the background to\nthe claim. The values of D. S.I.R. studentships jn the period 1953\nto 1962 included between \u00a340 and\n\u00a360 London differential. To\njustify removing this in 1962, the\nCivil Service produced a4 year-old survey of 170 postgraduates\nat 11 universities to show that\nLondoners lived adequately and\nfor more\nno more expensively than their\nprovincial colleagues.\nThe next year, A. Sc.W members held a more detailed survey\nof 250 London postgraduates,\nwhich showed that using the\nsame yardsticks as the Civil Service survey, nearly \u00a3600 p.a. was\na reasonable figure for London\nliving. Official arguments that\n\" students should expect to make\nsacrifices,\" are also easily an-s were d, since all students should\nmake the same sacrifices. At I present, London P.G.' s make a double sacrifice.\nThe Governments'final answer is always the same : \" the National cake isn't big enough \"; but at\na conservative estimate the value\nof graduates entering industry\neach year is equivalent to a \u00a3500\nmillion increase in the cake. This\nmakes the Government's discriminatory penny-pinching look more\nthan pound foolish.\nSixth Formers Spurn Science\nAPPLICATIONS\nDROP\n\" If pupils turn away from science at the top of the secondary\nschool and at the entrance to higher education . . . then something\nhas gone wrong on the way,\" declared Miss Alice Bacon, Minister\nof State for Education and Science, in Leeds on September 5.\nThis tendency is reflected in the situation at I.C., where 20 per\ncent less applications for places were received this year.\nThe facts about the trend away\nfrom technology should certainly\nprovide food for thought for the\npowers-that-be, especially in this\nCollege. The drop in applications for university places in\nscience and technology is reported\nto be quite widespread\u2014not just\nin England but on the Continent\nas well. People are going for the\nsocial sciences, because the\nscience courses are too difficult.\nFELIX was told by a member of\nstaff res pons ble for selection in\none of the big departments that\nthis will probably mean that\nschools will have to change their\nsyllabuses. Whether the schools\nwill agree with this diagnosis, of\ncourse, remains to be seen.\nMiss Bacon, who was addressing the British Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, said\nthere was a sense in which the\nspirit of science was more active\nin a progressive infants (school\nthan in any subsequent part of\nthe education service. There you\nhad children finding out for themselves about the qualities of materials\u2014of water and sand, and\npaint and clay\u2014and about their\neveryday environment, with a freshness and a sense of wonder\nthat somehow got lost as their\nlearning became more sophisticated and more rooted in the\ngiven truths of the tex&book. If\nthere was a turning away from\nscience at the top of the secondary school and at the entrance to\nhigher education\u2014and this was a subject about which we needed\nto know a great deal more\u2014then\nsomething had gone wrong on\nthe way.\nIt was important, of course,\nwhen we talked about a shortage\nof scientists and technologists, to\nkeep a clear perspective. In 1966\npupils following A level second\nyear studies confined to mathematics and science totalled 36,000\ncompared with 30,000 three years\nearlier. Moreover one of the\nhighly promising growth points\nwas mixed courses combining\nscience with other subjects. Here\nthe growth was from 6.000 to\n11,000. Since the beginning of\nthe sixties science entries at O level were up from half a million\nto three-quarters and passes from\n300,000 to over 400,000. At A level, passes were up from 77,000\nto 115,000. All this of course\nwould be reflected in the size of\nwhat was called the active stock\nof qualified scientific and technological manpower, which rose 15\nper cent in the three years to\n1965 and was expected to rise at\nabout the same rate in the three\nyears to 1968. Nevertheless it\nwas unlikely that demand in important sectors, notably industry\nand the schools, would be met by\nthe end of the decade. So we\nneeded to keep the spirit of wondering empiricism alive if more\nyoung people were to leave the\nschools and the colleges still caring and still curious about the\non-going transformation of life\nand work that was the hall-mark\nof the twentieth century.\nIf yon want pen, pad or paper, Veronica will have the answer. She\ncan be found on most days in the Union books tall. COM MEM. DAY BALL The Union is holding the Commemoration Day Ball at the\nRoyal Garden Hotel on Oct. 26th. Double tickets price 5 gn s. are\navailable from the Hon. Sec. of\nthe Entertainments committee,\nIC Union Office. Dancing will be\nfrom 9 p.m. till 2.30 a.m., and\nthen will be a running buffet\nfrom 9 p.m. onwards.\nThey're drunk for\nThis week all first years tu dents will be receiving a ques-tion n aire. Its subject is the drinking of alcohol and the senders of\nthe questionnaires want to know,\namong other things, whether\npeople drink and what they feel\nabout this and about other people\ndrinking alcohol.\nThe questionnaires are being\nsent by a Research Team at London University's Institute of\nPsychiatry. This team, which\nconsists of psychologists, psychiatrists and social research\nworkers are trying to find out\nmore about the social habits of\ndrinking and about the medical\nproblem of alcoholism. They\nhave designed this questionnaire\nto meet modern requirements of\nknowledge\nquestionnaire design and their\nexperience has been that people\nfind the subject a fascinating one\nand find the questionnaire ab-s orbing. The researchers stress that they\nare interested in what everybody\nhas to say about the subject;\nthey want everybody to reply\neven if they have never had a drink in their lives. They are\nalso entirely dependent on the\nwillingness of first year students to co-operate in this research and\nthey feel that the research will\nbe useful only if everyone who\nreceives a questionnaire fills it in\nand sends it back. Sending the\nquestionnaire back will be easy\nas there will be clearly marked\nboxes in the College into which\ncompleted questionnaires can be\nput. Or, students may return the\nquestionnaires via the College internal postal service.\nA member of the team will be\nin attendance in the Students'\nUnion during the week following\nthe sending of the questionnaire\nin order to discuss the survey\nwith anyone interested. Later on,\nthe team will again be in the\nCollege to discuss the results.\nAll replies are going to be treated\nas strictly confidential and nobody will be asked to put their\nnames on the questionnaires.\nRefectories BIG\nLOSS\nThe refectories have made the\nbiggest loss in their history in the\nyear ended July 1967. It is very\nprobable that to offset their losses\nin the coming year, prices will\nhave to be raised on a large\nnumber of items.\nGross takings for the year\namounted to \u00a3170,870. This is\nan increase on previous years\nbut while receipts have increased\ncosts have multiplied more\nrapidly. Mr. Mooney the Refectory Manager blames the loss\non increases in wages and a large\nincrease in the cost of living.\nHowever while wages have increased by \u00a34000 this is a smaller\nincrease than in previous years\nand the trend could well have\nbeen predicted. Food prices\nhowever have only risen by 4 per\ncent.\nIt is believed that the Union\nand Southside bars continued to\nmake a profit and hence the bars\nin many ways continue to sub sid is e the refectories.\nThe prices in the refectories\nhave remained static for two\nyears. It is now almost inevitable\nthat they will be increased.\nSTUDENT\nHOUSES\nThe first IC student house,\nwhich was to have opened at the\nbeginning of this academic year,\nhas not in fact materialise d.A statement issued by IC Executive\nmakes this clear:\n\" The report on Student\nHouses which occupied so\nmuch time at Council last\nsession, was presented to the\nGoverning Body on May 12.\nIt was very favourably received by the Governors who\nagreed that a pilot scheme\nshould be started as soon as\npossible.\nIt was hoped that IC's first Student House would be\nopen at the beginning of this\nsession but although plans\nwere well advanced, legal\ndifficulties outside the College's control have caused\nsome delay.\nAt the moment it is not\nknown when the first House will open, but if it is a success it is hoped to extend the\nscheme.\"\n\n"

    "content": "8 FELIX\nSPORTS NEWS Krakenauts Ahoy !\nImperial College is breaking into an area of sci\u00ab..\u00bbti fic research\nwhich has previously been dominated by governments and navies.\nProject KRAKEN, organised by I.C. Underwater Club, is the\ncollege's underwater living experiment, intended to improve substantially British knowledge in marine science.\nFor the last ten years Imperial\nCollege, has sent out underwater\nexpeditions to study topics ranging from diver-to-diver communication to the .effects of light on\nmarine life. However, there is\nsome research work that is difficult or impossible to undertake\nwith surface divers. This is generally for one of three reasons:\nThe experiment may be destroyed by bringing it to the sur-face, e.g. the swim bladder of a fish may burst due to the pressure\nchange. There is a limit on the\ntime a diver can stay under water\nand still surface directly. At 100\nfeet depth a diver who spends\nmore than 20 minutes on the\nbottom must only ascend in a slow carefully controlled manner.\nThis is known as decompressing.\nIt sets a limit on time and cost\nof diving operations at any depth\nbelow 30 feet. However, a diver\nliving in a bottom laboratory\nneed only surface once at the end\nof the week, he only decompresses once per week. Finally,\nthe surface worker must bear\nwith the unpleasantness of the sea\nsurface. Waves, wind and rain\nall combine to make life miserable for the poor sailor. In some\nphysical measurements the very\nmovement of a surface platform\ncould limit the scope of research.\nHaving demonstrated a need\nfor an underwater laboratory on\nscientific grounds, the same arguments can be extended to cover\ncommercial work. But where\ncould such a structure be ob-tai ned. The British Navy do not,\nas yet, see a military need for\none, and the cost of building one\non an industrial basis and running it for research would be pro-hi bit ive. This leaves the universities. This, \" Someone must do\nit, and we are in a better position\nthan most\" argument has re-g sul ted in KRAKEN. The photograph shows a full size wooden\nmock-up of Kraken now at the\nCollege.\nDon Boadella\nLast year I.C. Union financed\nDon Boadella on a trip to Canada\nas part of the Great Britain Rifle\nTeam. He recently wrote to the\nUnion to tell of his experiences.\nNourished almost entirely on\nspecially imported Whitbread, it\nseems he had a jolly good time\nand, furthermore, won all his\nshooting matches. He also spent\ntwo days in Montreal at Expo'67.\nAny other cracks hot wishing to\nvisit Expo '67 had better apply\nquickly\u2014the Union is rapidly\nrunning short of money!\nKraken is named after Lord\nTennyson's sea monster. It is a four-man house that is scheduled\nfor launching off Oban on the\nWest Coast of Scotland in Julv\n1968.\nThe Krakenauts will\nbreath a mixture of oxygen and\nnitrogen at the pressure of the\nsurrounding water. (This is unlike a submarine that is protected\nagainst this pressure.) It is this\npressure of 55 pounds per square\ninch that will enable them to\nenter and leave Kraken at will\nthrough a hole in the floor. The\nonly restriction is that these men\nare forbidden to surface without\nfirst spending many hours in a special chamber. An attack of\nthe \" Bends \" that would follow\nif a diver surfaced without this\nprecaution is one of the main\nhazards of this kind of work.\nElectric power and air will be\nprovided by a cable to the surface shore station.\nHOME COMFORTS\nThe Krakenauts, they will be\nof both sexes, will find life\nrather different to that on the\nsurface. Frying is not allowed,\nfrying smells are poisonous at\nthat depth. Water will not boil\nat the normal temperature and it\nis doug t ful if tea can be brewed.\nBeer and even champagne would\nbe completely flat. However,\nthey will have all the home com-forts, hot showers, central heat-ing, and, we hope, even te levi sion. They cannot smoke or use\nfountain pens (the ink would run\nout when the tide went out). The\ngirls must give up perfume\u2014it\ncould cause Kraken to explode !\nClothing will have to be simple\nand warm.\nKraken, the third deepest long-term living experiment, will be\nbreaking new ground on several\nfronts. It will be the deepest to\nuse an air-like gas, it will be the\nlongest so far, and it will be the\nfirst true underwater laboratory\nthat will be open to visiting scientists. To maintain the laboratory in\n90 feet of water a support team\nof at least 20 will be required.\nThe personnel will be drawn\nfrom a large number of universities and research centres in the\ncountry as well as Imperial College.\nWhat can the Felix reader do\n10 help Kraken. There are a vast\nnumber of jobs waiting to be\ndone. Whether your skills lie\nwith a paint brush or a type-writer, do come and lend a hand.\nAt the meeting on Thursday\nnight at 7 p.m. in the Physics Department, the ways in which you\njean help Kraken will be dis-' cussed.\nThe pride of the Union Imperial College Rugby Club, boasting one of the largest and\nstrongest memberships of the College, has a very full fixture list\nplanned this season, including most of the top London Clubs' 2nd XV's as well as the other London Colleges and Southern Universities. The club caters for Rugby players of every conceivable stan-dard. ItfieldsafirstXV team only on Wednesdays, but on Saturdays\nas many as ten sides may turn out to play. The dressing rooms and\npitches at Harlington are of a very high standard, and after an after-noon's matches the club traditionally retires to the bar\u2014where else ?\nLast season the 1st XV reached\nthe final of the University Cup\nbut after building up an early\nlead lost two men and eventually\nwent down by 14 points to 6.\n\" Undoubtedly this year the team\nwill walk away with that coveted\ntrophy, fate permitting,\" writes\nthe secretary. The close season\nbrings another competition, the\nSpakes Cup, variously described\nas an intercollegiate bloodbath or\na ninety-minute punch-up, between I.C.'s three constituent col-leg es. The cup is presented at\nthe Rugby Club Annual Dinner.\nDuring the Easter vacation the\nClub goes on tour. . In the last\nthree years it has been to Ireland\n(twice) and France. Needless to\nsay the Club claims the wine and\nGuinness drinking records of\nthese countries.\nFreshmen should not be put off\nby the size or strength of the\nClub. For those who like their\nRugby hard and are prepared to\ntrain, a place in one of the first\nthree or four teams is easily at-tain able. For those who prefer\nlesser or even \" coarse \" Rugby,\nthe B XVs will be eminently\nsatisfactory. The club provides\nan excellent opportunity for\nmeeting other students of every\nconceivable type at a very sociable level. The club's president\nis Professor Sparkes.\nLiving on\na Shoestring?\nNever mind, it can't last for ever.

Personalities speaking this year include old favourites like\nBenny Green and a number of stimulating and new faces.\nFor the benefit of fresher s \u2014and what isn't this week ?\u2014General\nStudies lectures are given during the lunch hour every Tuesday and\nThursday on an almost unrestricted range of extra-curricular topics.\nFor those who wish to hear about more than just science during their\nstay at I.C. these lectures are highly recommended.\nThis term the series is to cover\na broad scope. Among the\nspeakers are Mrs. B. Horton who\nspeaks on communication at\nwork, Benny Green who gives his\nviews on aspects of jazz and Miss\nMayer-Lissmann, who discusses\nWagner's \"The Ring.\" There\nwill also be a group of lectures\non \" Cosmology,\" in which,\namong other things, the current\nconflicting \" Big-bang\" and\n\"Steady state\" theories of the\nuniverse are considered; a series\nof recitals by actors and musicians of poetry and music; an\nimportant set of lectures by Mr.\nJohn Burrows on Social Policy\nToday and Tomorrow, discussing\nthe Welfare State and its problems, our educational systems and\nour National Health Service; and\na number of documentary films\nabout Twentieth Century history.\nThe full details and dates of these\nlectures are available in General\nStudies programmes which are\ndistributed about the College.\nTouchstone\nAnother way in which to break\nthe routine is to go on a Touchstone weekend. There are two of\nthese this term; forty students and\nstaff gather at Silwood Park, /the\nCollege field station, for a Saturday night and Sunday morning of\nfree and vigorous discussion on\nan important topic of general\ninterest. Touchstone weekends,\nheld in the country near Virginia\nWater, can be immensely relaxing after the noise of London.\nAmong the topics set for this term\nis \" Sex problems of undergraduates and their solution\" led by\nDr. Wendy Greengross, whose\nGeneral Studies lectures last year\nwere the most popular by a large\nmargin. Details of other subjects\nhave not yet been released.\nMrs B. Horton MRS. B. HORTON is speaking\non Oral Communication at Work.\nShe claims to be following an entirely new line in this field, the\nfruits of which should appear in\nher lectures, and has recently\nbeen applying her ideas in a Yorkshire coal mine. Her previous\nactivities have been many, such\nas a journalist, BBC producer and\nhistorian. She has written a biography of Anthony Trollope. and\nalso two novels \" too long ago to\nremember.\" The subject of her\nlectures could become important\nand will certainly be interesting to\nthose planning a career fin in-dust ry. Opera Mrs. B. Horton\nMiss ELSE MAYER-LISMANN\nis a founder and director of Opera\nWorkshop and passionately devoted to opera. She holds an Honours degree from and is a special\nlecturer in the Royal College of\nMusic. She also lectures on such\noccasions as the Edinburgh Festival and at Glyndebourne and is\ncertainly a well-qualified speaker\nto discuss Wagner's\" The Ring.\"\nSMALL ADS Pete Ruhemann wishes to announce that he will be at College\nduring the session 1967-68.\nJazz Critic Benny Green\nBENNY\nGREEN\nA well-known and popular\npersonality at I.C. this term will\nbe Benny Green. He will talk\nin General Studies on \"Aspects\nof Jazz.\"\nAt present jazz critic of the\n\" Observer,\" he has had a long\nand varied career either playing\njazz or talking about it. Born\n1927, he was a full-time jazz\nmusician from 1947 to 1960 and\nplayed with a large number of\nwell-known bands in this period.\nPlaying either baritone or tenor\nsax, he worked with such well-known figures as Ronnie Scott,\nDizzy Rees, Stan Kenton and\nRalph Sharon. His tastes in jazz\nand, of course, particularly in the\nsaxophone tend towards the classic greats and away from the\nmodern avant-garde school. When\nquestioned about his tastes, he\nadmitted that he considered Ornette Coleman's music as \" rubbish\u2014and you can quote me on\nthat \" (so we did). Among saxophonists he favours Lester Young,\nCharlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins and Stan Getz and he also\nappreciates the work of Billie\nHolliday and Duke Ellington,\nBix Beiderbecke and Paul Gonsalves. All this will probably be\nreflected in his lectures.\nHis other enterprises have\nincluded participating in a PoetryMusic Theatre collaboration\ncalled \" Of Eros and of dust,\"\nand writing two books\u2014\" Reluctant Art,\" about jazz and\n\" Blame it on j my Youth,\" an\nautobiography. He describes\nhimself as \" a mechanical imbecile \" and is a blunt but witty\nspeaker. His lectures should be\nwell worthwhile\u2014they were last\nyear.\nHow reading The Observer\ncan help you choose\na career\nEvery Sunday The Observer gives you\nthe best kind of background information about jobs. Joy Larkcom studies a specific career each week. Advertising\n\u2014computer jobs\u2014the best openings\nfor scientists\u2014banking\u2014jobs abroad.\nEach field is critically examined. She\ntells you about the qualities employers\nlook for; salary scales; promotion pro-spec ts; the sort of people you would\nwork with. She takes a look beneath\nthe surface of the appointment ads,\nand is objective, well-informed and\nhelpful.\nReading The Observer makes you\nmore aware. It could also help shape\nyour future.\nGET\nTHE OBSERVER EVERY SUNDAY\n\n"
