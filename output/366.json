We managed a54 victory thanks to stirring\nwork in defence by Jim Williams\nwho saved us from certain\ndefeat.\nMonday arrived in a similar\nmanner, only this time we had\nthe whole day to train and\npractice before the evening's match against Bridfort at\nWestbay, We arrived in Westbay\nto find the pitch marked out\nin the local river.

The first against\nthe Young Officers of Bovington\nCamp, tn spite the referees\ninitial belief that we had not\nplayed before, we came out as\n5 4-0 victors. The squad was\nat last playing as a team and\nfound the ill-organised army\nteam easy prey.\nAs expected the last match\nproved to be the hardest of\nthe tour. The experienced team\nof Taunton S.C. fell to our\nmuch superior teamwork to the\ntune of 13-2.\nAfter a well earned rest\non Thursday, the team of\nPaul Hindle, Andy Smith,\nPaul Taylor, Mike McCartney,\nMark Taylor, Jim Williams,\nCliff Spooner and Colin Henson\nheaded back to London well\npleased with the victories and\nthe highly enjoyable spirit in\nwhich the whole tour was\nconducted.

    "content": "FIL JX ASTONISHINGLY enough, perhaps\nthe criticisms recently aimed at FELIX have been welcomed by the Editor, for\nthey collectively raise the fundamental\nissue: Too many people are totally\nignorant of the complexities and drawbacks involved with printing FELIX by\nOffset-lithography. All the text of\nFELIX has to be typeset on a machine\ncalled a Varityper. It is a super-typewriter (super to the extent that\na re-conditioned model costs over\n\u00a32,000); it has interchangeable type\nfaces and it has provision whereby the\ntwo sides of a column of text can be\nmade parallel. This process, called\njustification, takes exactly twice the\namount of time it would normally take\nto type the text, because everything\nhas to be typed out twice.\nWe have a Varityper on the Union\npremises and College has provided us\nwith a full-time operator, but as you\nmust by now surely realise, were\nthere to be a sudden glut of news mid-week, we would not be able to print\nit all, because it could not be typeset\nin time. So simply due to the circumstances that surround the production,\nFELIX'S topical it y is threatened.\n'But', you will say, ' this never happened\nlast year, did it? Late news sometimes\nwent in on Sunday night and FELIX\nstill appeared Tuesday morning'.\nBut last year FELIX was printed using\nRotary Letterpress by an outside\nprinting firm \u2014 experts in their trade \u2014\nto whom edited copy was sent with\nlayout instructions. In those days there\nwas no 'Damn, the glue has smudged'\nor 'How on earth are we going to fill\nthat spare inch on page 3' or even\n'God, this let ra setting takes such a long time'.\nTimes have changed. The commitment required of the Editor and his\nstaff has changed. The sooner people\nrecognise that, the better.\nIt is extremely tempting to facetiously\nre-name the 'Letters' column as 'The\nBitching Column'. Such an inappropriate\ntitle would naturally belie the true\nfunction of the column, which is there\nso that people can make a point in\npublic which they feel to be very\nimportant. They are not making a fuss\njust for its own sake as in the case\nof the rather whimsical space-filler on\nthe back of the recent Guildsheet Extra.\nDue to the apparent necessity of\nprinting NUS motions, some ads and\narticles had to be omitted in this issue.\nEvery effort will be made to print\nthem next week where appropriate.\nC.A G.

As well you know, Theta\nthe mascot of RCS was snatched\nby City and Guilds Union on\nThursday. However, on several\noccasions since then I and\nother members of my Union\nhave heard them actively\nencouraging members of RCS\nto take some retaliatory steps\nand generally talking in a very pro-RCS fashion that I could well expect Mr. Teague\nto use. How responsible are\nthey for the stupid attack on\nGuilds Union Office on Friday\nnight?\nIn present times, when we\nhave been having long discussions about the roles of\nthe CCU's and ICU, and trying\nto build a strong structure'\nthis attitude of the Hon. Sec.\nand the D.P. seems extremely\nunwarranted.\nWhen someone is elected\nto such an esteemed position,\nI would have expected them to\nleave behind the'petty wrangling s and rivalry of the CC U's' to quote one of them. However,\nit seems that they insist on\nremaining 'active' members\nof RCS and hence I wonder\nwhether they are capable or\neven worthy of helping to\ncreate this strong and stable\nstructure that all would agree\nwe need!\nYours faithfully,\nJenny Jones,\nPresident,\nC&G Union.\nAthletic Clubs Committee,\nImperial College Union.\n18th October, 1974.\nDear Sir,\nWe, the undersigned, are\nextremely put out by the\ndistinct lack of sports coverage\nin todays FELIX.

    "content": "Fit IX This Week we begin a new column in FELIX called 'Forum'.\nThe idea of this column is to stimulate discussion on various\ntopics of general interest, but not necessarily all involved with\nstudents. This week's issue is 'Mastermind', that well known\nBfBCprogramme starring Magnus Magnusson, and you can read\nnhat Riz Shakir has to say on It and the IC entry into University\nChallenge below. Next week's author will be Stephen Richardson.\nMasterMIND!\nMOST OF us have watched 'Mastermind' sometime or another.\nSome of us were probably bemused and many others amazed by\nthe apparently stupendous knowledge of the participants.\nHowever, I am sure not many of us have asked such obvious\nquestions as: What purpose does this programme serve? ; What\ndoes it teach one if anything? ; What does it prove? ; etc.\nIt's reputed to be an 'intellectual' programme (Dictionary\ndefines 'intellect' as being 'the faculty of thinking and\nreasoning'). But what has it done for our intellect? If it has not\neven inspired us so much as to analyse the meaning and\nimplications of its title.\nThe title, at subconscious level, unconscious level, call\nit what you will, 'suggests' that it is a process whereby a person with a 'master mind' is selected. (Dictionary defines\n'mind' as being 'thinking faculties as distinguished from the\nbody i.e. intellectual faculties'). However, it has very little\nto do with the mind and is in reality a test of memory. In fact,\nin many cases it boils down to whether a person has had the\ntime and/or the opportunity to read the relevant literature.\nHence it is not even a test of memory.\nAs regards the participants, I think they are rather arrogant,\nbig headed and supercilious to say the least. Basically they\nare weak and need to reassure themselves of their 'importance',\nin order to maintain their self-image.\nPersonally I admire those people most, who are ingenious\nenough to improvise a solution when they encounter unfamiliar\nsituations, than those who can recall facts. 'A computer can\nretain facts indefinitely where as it cannot produce solutions\ninstantaneously'.\nAs an ancient Punjabi saying sums up so perceptively\n'A donkey loaded with books doesn't become a scholar'. (A lot\nof the feeling has been lost in translation, however the gist is\nclear).\nThe above also applies to other programmes of similar nature\nand their participant. The prop ect ive IC team for 'University\nChallenge' being an important exception to this generalisation.\nBeing.of highest 'intellectual standards' (???), they would not\npartake in such a mediocre gathering but for the fact that the\nICU will receive \u00a3100 and free BOOZE will be provided for the\nparticipants.\nGAS CONVERSION\nThe process of conversion to natural gas will begin in the\nCollege next Monday, 28th October. On that day all College\nbuildings to the north of Prince Consort Road will be without\ngas for twenty-four hours from 8 o 'clock in the morning.\nConversion work in all buildings south of Prince Consort\nRoad, including Prince's Gardens, will begin two days later,\non Wednesday, 30th October, when there will be no gas supply\nfor the twenty-four hours starting at 8 a.m.( Evelyn Gardens,\nQueensberry Place and Hamlet Gardens will not form part of\nthe present conversion programme). Once the conversion\nprocess has started, it is anticipated that it will probably\ntake about seven days to restore full service to all areas of\nthe College.\nAccess.\nOn Monday and Wednesday, the Gas Board will require\naccess from 8 a.m. to all areas included in the conversion\nprogramme, including certain of the Halls of Residence.\nAnyone who is likely to be away from the College should\narrange for their key to be available from their Departmental\nSuperintendent or, in the case of private accommodation, from\nthe Domestic Bursar.\nThere will be only coffee and sandwiches available in the\nUnion Lower Refectory on Monday.\nWhilst it is certain that there will be meals available in\nCollege Block and Southside on Wednesday, it is uncertain\nwhether they will be hot.\nOur society is a melting-pot of\ninfluences. Some good. And some\nbad-Many graduates are concerned\nenough about society to realise\nthat some of its most acute conflicts\noccur in the treatment of offenders.\nAnd as a result they join the\nProbation & After-Care Service.\nAs probation officers, their job is\nto enquire into the background of\nthose who have got into trouble\nwith society and to work across the\nboundaries of the problems that\npresent themselves. The range of\nsocial work and the element of\npersonal involvement is\nconsiderable and the rewards in\nhuman terms are great indeed for\nthe right sort of person.\nHow do you start? Normally\nthrough sponsorship as a trainee\nprobation officer on a course of\nprofessional training recognised by\nthe Central Council for Education\nand Training in Social Work and\nleading to the Council's Certificate\nof Qualification in Social Work.\nCourses last between one and two\nyears depending on your degree\nsubjects. Graduate trainees are\npaid at present a salary of at least\n\u00a31416. This rises after training to\n\u00a31926 and then can rise to \u00a33390 and\nabove by promotion. The highest\ngrades earn up to \u00a37000. Threshold\nagreements operate. Probation\nofficers working in the London\narea receive additional\nremuneration.\nFor more information about the\nProbation & After-Care Service as\na career please send your name and\naddress on a postcard to the Home\nOffice, Probation and After-Care\nDepartment (WM) Room 446,\nRomney House, Marsham Street,\nLondon SW1P 3DY or get in touch\nwith your local Chief Probation\nOfficer whose address and telephone\nnumber are in the telephone book.\nProbation & After-Care Service\n\n"

No. 366 FRIDAY. 25th OCTOBER, 1974.\nWARWICK UNION\nLONGFORD AT\nMORE HOUSE LORD LONGFORD spoke at More House on Thursday 17th October. His theme was 'Crime and Punishment'.\nFull R&p rrr t Next Week.\nTHETA SNATCH\nSilly Sports\nsee centre\npages\nRansacking of Guilds Office\nSQUEEZED\nTHE BULK of \u00a340,000 of\nUnion today remain frozen by\nSenate of the University.\nThis decision follows the\nappointment by the Union of\nJefffStaniforth to the post of\nits.- permanent Secretary.\nPreviously the Union and the\nSteering Committee made this\nappointment jointly, however,\nit is believed that the com-mitte e's decision is related\nto Jeff Staniforth's previous\nposition as NUS treasurer for\ntwo years.\nThe funds were frozen on\nOctober 2nd, after a union\nmeeting, attended by 1200\nstudents, endorsed the appointment of Jeff Staniforth.\nA legal advisor from NUS said\nthere is no precedent for the\nfreeze and the University\nauthorities would probably\nlose the case in court. Moreover, the authorities appear\nunable to produce an alternative\nappointee.\n\u00a316,000 was released to\nthe Union (\u00a313,000 to clear\nlast year's deficit) but the\ncommittee refuse to allow\nMr. Staniforth's salary to be\npaid. This resulted in the new\nArts Centre being occupied\nfrom Tuesday afternoon to\nThursday following a Union\nGeneral Meeting decision on\nOctober 8th. The University\nENTS LOSE E517 on Chapman\nWhitney\nStreetwalkers\nfunds due to Warwick Students\nthe Steering Committee of the\nauthorities then had a meeting\nwith Union Officers. At this,\nthe Steering Committee agreed\nto release the first instalment\nof local education authority\ngrants. The University also\nagreed to recognise Jeff\nStaniforth but not as permanent\nSecretary. They will call him\n'Senior Administrator', and\nrecognise him in any dealings\nwith the University. The\nfeeling at Warwick is that this\nis not really a concession as\nMr. Staniforth's job is to\nadminister the new Union\nbuilding not 'haggle with\nUniversity bureaucrats'.\nWhen I spoke to Jeff\nStaniforth by phone he reiterated this point saying\n'The real issue is who controls\nthe new Union building'.\nIt has taken seven years of\neffort to get the building,\nwhich will be completed next\nyear. Jeff Staniforth also\nremarked on the farcical\naspects of the situation\nlikening it to 'a Monty Python\nsketch with people running\naround with memos'.\nOn a more serious note the\nPresident of Warwick University Students Union said\n'The University's refusal to\nallow the Union to appoint the\nstaff who it feels would be\nbest for the job raises the\nwhole question of student\nUnion autonomy'. NUS\nPresident John Randall issued\na statement saying, 'We\nsupport the Warwick students\nin their stand. A students'\nUnion's right to make its own\ndecisions and appoint its own\nstaff is a crucial right for\nwhich NUS has fought and will\nfight again'.\n\n"

Meantime, when it\ncomes to looking for support\nwe tend to fall between two\nchairs; as far as the authorities are concerned we are\na french establishment (God\nforbid), as far as the french\nare concerned we are English. Needless to say this drop\nin numbers directly affects\nthe Union and we find ourselves with considerably\nless funds than last year\nwhich in turn limits our\nactivities and makes us\nincreasingly dependent on\nlarger colleges. A case of:\nyou provide the facilities\nand we provide the females.\nA number of IC societies are\nenthusiastically supported\nby girls from IF, particularly\nfolk club, ski club, dram soc.\n(of which the female contingent is almost entirely\nfrom IF) and ICWSC (which\nincidentally is the only\nsociety to my knowledge\nthat charges girls from IF a higher membership fee \u2014\ncould it be that they don't need us?) I think that this\nlink which has existed\nbetween IF and IC for some\nyears now should be encouraged which is why we\nare always willing to combine\nefforts in organising some-thing. So, any suggestions?\n(-as the actress said to the\nBishop).\nMeanwhile, of course, IC\nstudents are always welcome\nto use our extensive facilities\nwhich include two common\nrooms (with drink machines,\nno less!) and a union room\nat least four times bigger\nthan Mines' union, and wait\nfor it \u2014 a rest room, which\nunfortunately is always\nlocked. In fact, no-one\nappears to have actually\nseen the inside of this room\nbut any rumours suggesting\nthat the door opens on to a brick wall are strongly denied.\nOne might believe that\nthis lack of facilities or\nrather 'centralisation' as one\nof our french lecturers put\nit, might enable one to bully,\npersuade, threaten the girls\ninto coercive activity; not\nso, once inside the front\ndoor the IF girl becomes\nstrangely elusive, with an\namazing aptitude for ignoring\nposters, leaflets, handouts,\nand all in all, a resistance\nto bump h equalled only by\nthe IC male. However, the\nenthusiasm of the minority\ncertainly makes up for the\nrest, and this we hope to\nshow by our participation in\nRag this year \u2014 that is, if\nwe ever get notification of\na Rag meeting.\nThis week saw a great\nliterary achievement in the\nform of Ents sheet, unfortunately the content was\na little on the thin side for\nthe simple reason that\nalthough the grapevine is\ngoing strong it is not altogether reliable and we\ncannot publicise events\nwhich we don't know about.\nThis fortnightly paper has\na wide circulation, so in\norder to take advantage of\nthis to advertise your events,\npick up the phone (between\n1.00 and 1.30p.m.) dial\n584 9882 and state what,\nwhen, where, and how much,\nand before your very eyes\n(or a week or so later) it\nwill appear in print. It\ncould hardly be simpler.\nFinally you may have\nnoticed some scaffolding in\nfront of IF during the past\nweek. It seems that it is\nhaving a face lift. Well, I know I did mention the other\nweek 71a peeling walls and\ngeneral look of neglect' but\nI hardly expected to be\ntaken seriously. After all,\nit had character.\n\n"
