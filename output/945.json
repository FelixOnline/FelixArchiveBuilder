And if that's not enough, there's free beer afterwards!\nHunger and Poverty\u2014the facts\n\u2022 Up to 18\nmillion people die\nof hunger every\nyear \u2014most of\nthem women and\nchildren.\n\u2022 70% of the\nworld's poorest\npeople are\nwomen \u2014and\nthey're far more\nlikely than men to\nhave too little to\neat.\n\u2022 In 1990 there\nwere over 180\nmillion\nmalnourished\nchildren under 5.\n\u2022 And every day,\n36,000 children\nunder 5 die as a result of\npoverty \u2014one\nevery 2.4\nseconds.\nHow To Get The Free Beer!\nThe Oxfam Fast is taking place on\nNovember 6th for 24 hours. The\nidea is simple: you give up\nsomething, (not necessarily food),\nget sponsored for it and give the\ncash to OXFAM. If you raise more\nthan \u00a3 2 0 you get a free pint at a Firkin pub on November 7th, and\nif the Imperial group together raises\nmore than \u00a31000, we will get a free\nfir kin(72 pints of beer) barrel.\nWhat The Money Will Do\nBy skipping a few meals, you will\nshow that you care about the\ninequalities which lead to 18 million\npeople dying of hunger every year.\nThe money raised will help to\nrelieve poverty and suffering\namongst the world's poorest people.\n\u00a35 could buy over 140 tree saplings,\nwhich will help to reduce soil\nerosion and increase food\nproduction.\nThird World First\nThe Fast at Imperial College is\nbeing co-ordinated by the ICU\nbranch of Third World First. Third\nWorld First is a national\norganisation of around thirty college\ngroups. It is non-charitable and is\ntherefore more direct in its\ncampaigns than charities such as\nOxfam. The group at Imperial is\nvery active; it campaigns, educates\nand raises awareness on Third\nWorld issues.\nHow To Get Involved\nIf you are interested in getting\ninvolved in the Oxfam fast, or if\nyou want to know exactly what\nhappens to money given to Oxfam,\nthen contact us via the Union Office\npigeon holes or come along to any\nof our meetings.\nWhere To Get The Fast Packs\nThe Fast packs (containing\nsponsorship sheets and Oxfam\ninformation) can be obtained from\nICU Third World First, any branch\nof Oxfam, the chaplaincy or the\nUnion Office reception.\nIf *U to* W KT WM S< MM TT NOTE <\nj(?EM S8 It&MtU Of TBA Efc& JUIU8RIUM,\n\\JUM, HtSfc'S WHAt< NE WKT TO SEE- MTOoPCtME CuB WM CV MUUSTWtWTS- AMD AM6H0TJ\nSUBSIDIZED CCNSWArTwW\nMM Dots\nWXTHM\nEAT L \u00a3 \u00ab\n\\\nPage 10\n\n"

Don\nFoster, the Liberal Democrat\nEducation spokesman, has swept\naside Government claims that the\nConservatives are the party of\neducation, and accused the\ngovernment not being committed to\nstudents. Mr Foster says that replies\nto a party survey show that 93 % of\nfull time students are 'desperate' for\nterm time employment to pay\nregular bills. He adds that the\nnumber of students seeking help\nfrom student union welfare advisors\nhas 'increased significantly' over\nthe past two years. 'Students have\nbeen dealt a triple whammy of\ndelayed payments of grants at\ninsufficient levels followed by\nchronic undergraduate\nunemployment', says Mr Foster.\nHigh Street banks have also been\nexpressing concern at levels of\nstudent debt. Barclays Bank claims\nthat the average student leaving\ncollege this year will owe \u00a31,765,\nand they expect this to top \u00a32,800\nin three year's time. The Midland\nBank say that 7% of student\naccounts have overdrafts of between\n\u00a3500 and \u00a31,000, and Lloyds have\nannounced that the proportion of\nstudents with overdrafts has risen\nfrom 39% to 44% in two years.\nby our News Team\nThe Imperial College Union\nCareers Fair took place on Tuesday\nand Wednesday of this week. 54\ncompanies attended the Fair,\nslightly down on last year's figure.\nThe number of students attending\nthe fair was also down this year.\nThis drop is being blamed on the\nrecession, though the organisers are\nquietly pleased at the turnout.\nThe fair comes at a time when the\nlevel of graduate unemployment is\nrising, and when companies are\nrethinking their recruitment\npolicies. The number of employable\ngraduates has increased more than\nthe number of vacancies. A representative of British Telecom at\nthe Careers Fair said he expected\nin excess of 8000 applicants for\nonly 150 places. Students applying\nfor employment last summer have\nsaid that this is not atypical.\nAlso under review are the\nmilk round selection interviews\nconducted by companies. The\nnumber of companies giving these\ninterviews has been on the decline\nin recent years, with a greater\nnumber of companies requiring\ndirect applications. A number of top\ncompanies are to be absent from\nboth careers fairs and milk rounds this year.\nTV Licence Dodgers Christmas Pay-Up\nby Gareth Light\nStudents are to be targeted in the\nlatest crackdown on television\nlicence dodgers. Students with a main operated television set or\nvideo recorder which can receive\npublic television programmes and\nbroadcast services must buy a licence, which currently costs \u00a3 8 0\nper year. Failure to comply with the\nlaw could result in a maximum fine\nof \u00a31,000.\nBrian Sproat, the Managing\nDirector of TV Licensing, said that\nstudent could use a 'quarterly\nbudget scheme' to purchase a licence. The scheme spreads the\nannual cost over four instalments,\neach of \u00a3 2 1 . 2 5 . The scheme\nincludes a 'premium' of \u00a31.25 per\nquarter.\nStudents are exempted from\nbuying a licence for battery\npowered televisions, which are\ncovered by their parents' licence.\nby Rick Bilby\nand Marc Swan\nWilson House residents who will be\nvacating their rooms over the\nChristmas vacation are to have their\nrents refunded. Sheelagh\nCrampton, Accommodation and\nConference Manager, has agreed\nthat students will not be charged as\na result of accidental\nmisinformation sent to them. A document posted with the letter of\nacceptance for a place in the hall\nstated that there would be no charge\nover Christmas provided the room\nwas vacated. On arrival at Wilson\nHouse, students were asked to sign\na licence document accepting that\npayment would be made over\nChristmas in all cases. After\nadverse reaction from Wilson\nHouse residents, the rent refund\narrangement was agreed. Students\nare now advised to pay their current\nhall bills as issued.\nHitachi Lectureship\nMeetings Called\nby PJ Dodd\nHitachi Group Ltd is to fund a lectureship in Neural Systems\nEngineering at Imperial College.\nThe lectureship will be based in the\nElectrical and Electronic\nEngineering Department. Current\nwork in the department involves\ndeveloping architectures to enhance\ncognitive processing capabilities so\nthat computers will have the\ncapability of natural language and\nscene recognition, whilst continuing\nwork on conventional pattern\nrecognition type systems. Professor\nIgor Aleksander, head of the Neural\nPardon?\nDeaf Awareness Week is\nbetween 26 October and 31 October\nthis year, writes Gareth Light.\nOrganised by the British Deaf\nAssociation, the week's events are\ndesigned to highlight the often\nunseen achievements made by deaf\nSystems Engineering Group and\nhead of the Electrical and Electronic\nEngineering department said of the\nlectureship, 'This is an excellent\nopportunity for bringing together\nthe advanced work that Hitachi is\ndoing in the field of neural networks\nwith Imperial's25 years experience\nin the field.'

More information can\nbe obtained from Christine Estine\nat the BDA on 071 839 5566.\nby Our News Staff\nChris Davidson. Imperial College\nUnion President, is to begin regular\ninformal meetings with students.\nThe first meeting will take place this\nMonday (26 October) at 1pm in the\nEnts Lounge in the Union Building.\nThe meetings were promised by\nMr Davidson in a post election\ninterview on IC Radio. At the time,\nMr Davidson said that the meetings\nwould be modelled on existing Rag\nmeetings. He added that he would\nuse the meetings to discuss his\nweekly diary, and remarked 'if I deserve a hard time, I 'll be there to\nget it'.\nMr Davidson is believed to have\ndelayed the meetings until the new\nterm had 'calmed down a bit'.\nOther sabbaticals have not indicated\nif they will take part in the\nmeetings, or if they will hold\nalternative ones. Mr Davidson has\nalready said that other sabbaticals\nshould take part in his meetings.\nRag Total Up\n200 Imperial students raised close\non \u00a35,000 during last Saturday's Monopoly. The final Monopoly\ntotal of \u00a34,648.73 brings the\nImperial College Union Rag total so\nfar this year to \u00a37,325.96. The\nmoney was raised during Londonwide collections on Saturday, and\nan overnight collection in Leicester\nSquare. This year's event was\nslightly disrupted by the current\nbombing campaign, and organisers\nhave also said that the recession was\nhaving an impact on donations.\nTomorrow, Rag will be\ncollecting for UNICEF in London,\nand the first Rag Raid of term will\ntake place in Cambridge.

A dancer myself,\nI loved the film and was pleased to\nsee a film about dancing where the\nactors could actually dance.!\nBallroom champion Scott is\ndumped by his partner Liz and his\nhopes of winning the Pan Pacific\nGrand Prix shatter. But from the\nshadows emerges Fran, a beginner\ndancer. The storyline isn't original;\nboy meets girl, dons sequins,\nthrows girl round shoulders.\nHowever, it's done with a style that\nsets it above other romantic\ncomedies. It has quality and off-the-wall humour that sets the screen\nalight.\nRomance is thinner on the\nground. Fran is cast in the ugly-ducking role, but change those\nglasses and baggy shirt for a figure-hugging dress and she is\ntransformed. The love, though, is\ninnocent not sexual.\nSee it in a cinema. It will lose a lot on video. Director Baz\nLuhrmann has captured something\nthat others have failed to get:\nAtmosphere.\nSEE THE FILM AND JOIN\nTHE DANCE CLUB. Bryan Crotaz.\nHusbands And Wives\nHusbands And Wives is Woody\nAllen's22 nd film, controversially\nreleased amid his turbulent divorce\nwith Mia Farrow. It concerns two\nmiddle-aged married couples who,\nin turn, temporarily split up and\nhave unsuccessful affairs, whilst\nevaluating questions of commitment\nand change.\nIn this film one can see all the\nclassic characteristics of vintage\nAllen: the occasional and very\nfunny one-liners, the s at iri z ation of\nfamous psychoanalysts and\nnovelists, the sudden 'stepping out\nof the screen' when the characters\nare interviewed (as seen in Annie\nHall and more explicitly in The\nPurple Rose Of Cairo), and the\ntwenties music. But there are some\nnovel additions, most notably the\nphotography - the camera is\nconstantly on the move, following\nthe characters round with excessive\nenthusiasm, never scared to place\nitself in the thick of the action. So\nit's a bit like watching The Cook\nReport and this had the effect of\ndrawing me deeper into the film.\nStrictly Sequinned\nCOMPETITION\nWin a beautiful 'STRICTLY BALLROOM' t shirt.\nSimply complete the following phrase\nI want this t shirt so very, very, very much because\nAs many words as you deem appropriate.

    "content": "Felix 945\neat ure23 October 1992\nMercy drive to Russia\nAs Ilya Eigenbrot risks border guards, hyperinflation and the Russian mafia\nto provide aid to those starving in St Petersburg, Declan Curry asks why?\nSome may think that Ilya Eigenbrot\nis slightly mad. At the end of this\nmonth, he is to make a return\njourney to his native Russia, driving\noverland through some of the most\ndangerous territory on earth. He\nwill deal with corrupt border\nguards, harsh weather conditions,\nand a mafia that makes the Italian\nvariety look like stage props on\n'Blazing Saddles'. His mission is to\ndeliver medical and scientific\nsupplies to the people of St.\nPetersburg.\nThis is Ilya's second trip to the\nRussian republic, which he left as\na child in 1973. A chemistry\npostgraduate at Imperial, Ilya last\nwent to Russia in July, bringing\nmedical and scientific supplies. He\nwas shocked by what he saw. T had\nseen the third world on television\nbut I did not expect to see the fifth\nworld in Russia,' he says.\nOn his first trip, he and his father\ndrove across the Finnish-Russian\nborder to St. Petersburg, and then\ndrove a second car to Moscow. Ilya\nexplains that their first car, with\nforeign registration plates, was\nbecoming an obvious target for the\nRussian mafia. They decided to\nchange to one with less conspicuous\nRussian plates.\nOn this journey, Ilya and his two\ncolleagues, Colin Lawrence and\nBen Krystall, will travel by ferry\nfrom Harwich to Gothenburg, and\nthen drive to Stockholm. After this\nthey will take the ferry to Turku in\nFinland, and then drive for an\novernight border crossing.\nOf the total journey time of ten\ndays, the trio will spend three and\na half days in St. Petersburg, their\nonly port of call. On a total budget\nof \u00a3900, they will bring further\nmedical and scientific supplies to\nthe beleaguered city. The medical\nsupplies will go to one regional\nhospital in the area. Ilya believes\nthat it is better to concentrate help\nin one building, rather than\nspreading it around different\nhospitals. Scientific supplies will be\ndelivered to the St. Petersburg\nMarine Technology Institute and the\nSt. Petersburg Machine Builders\nInstitute. Russian science, once a driving technological force, is\ndying. The British equipment, some\nsecond-hand from Imperial, is a vital, if limited, lifeline.\nIlya decided to make a second trip\nafter witnessing shocking scenes of\ndeprivation, decay and\ndisintegration. He was strongly\nadvised not to return to Russia. The\nThe Mechanical Engineering Building in St Petersburg\nStreet sales, hawkers sell dried fish and old toys for hard currency\nborder roads the team will be\ntravelling along are isolated and\npatrolled by the Russian mafia, the\nvicious, ruthless remnants of old\nCommunist brutality. The mafia are\nnot above the law in Russia. They\nmake the law. Acting with complete\nimpunity, undeterred by a hopelessly ineffective police force,\nthe mafia stops and seizes foreign\nregistered cars, stealing contents\nand abducting passengers. The\nnormal manner of stopping is with\na machine gun. Ilya and his team\nwill wear bullet proof vests.\nIlya does not paint a hopeful\npicture of life in Russia. After\ntelephoning colleagues in St.\nPetersburg, he says that things are\nnow even worse than in July. He\npoints to the problems of exchange\nrates and hyperinflation, both\nmauling the standard of living, and\nreducing the republic to a state of\nchronic shortage. Monthly inflation\nis currently running at between 10%\nand 15%, yet wages for public\nsector employees have not been\npaid for three months. A professor\nof Marine Technology at St.\nPetersburg Marine Technology\nInstitute earns only \u00a37 per month,\nwhen he gets paid. Currently, the\nprofessor, his wife and his mother\nare surviving on his mother's pension and his wife's paltry\nincome.\nThe future does not hold much\ncheer. A hard winter is expected.\nIt has already begun to snow in St.\nPetersburg, one month earlier than\nusual. The temperature in Moscow\nis currently 10\u00b0C below freezing.\nIlya also expects mass famine this\nwinter. Storms have knocked the\nwheat crop down, and the potato\nharvest has failed. There is still no\nsign of Western aid reaching those\nwho need it. The Mafia sell\nhumanitarian supplies on the black\nmarket.\nRussia remains politically\nunsettled. Coupled to the worrying\nrise in anti- Semitism, Ilya is\nconcerned at the widespread feeling\nin St. Petersburg that a coup is\nimminent. Not, he adds, 'the\noperetta of last year', but a well\nplanned, ruthlessly executed coup,\neither from the military or from the\nfar right. Many in Russia feel that\nonly a coup could end the current\n'Alice in Wonderland' economics.\nHe adds that some Russians would\nprefer to be a nourished slave rather\nthan 'a starving free man'.\nAll this reinforces Ilya's determination to deliver aid directly\nto the people. In spite of what he\nhas seen, he remains slightly\noptimistic, and dismisses critics\nwho say his mercy mission is a drop\nin the ocean. He says, T can do\nsomething as a student and that\nencourages me as it shows that\nwe're not as helpless as we first\nthink.'\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nFelix 945 23 October 1992\nBabes in Toyland \u2014\nEdinburgh Queens Hall\nHow exactly I came to be in\nScotland was surprising, quite how\nI came to be in the same country as\nsupport band Jacob's Mouse was\nannoying but how the hell I came\nto be watching Babes in Toyland in\nan Edinburgh church was\ndownright bloody bizarre! Then\nagain, they do things differently in\nScotland, you know.\nThe Queen's Hall in Edinburgh\nis a church, no converted about it.\nAs a result it's civilised beyond\nbelief. No alcohol is to be\nconsumed inside it (there is a separate bar though) and smoking\nis allowed only upstairs to protect\nthe carpets. What's more you don't need to worry about leaving the bar\nearly because in true theatre fashion\nthere's a bell rung to tell you when\nthe band's about to take the stage.\nThey start off a little shakily, I think that like me they're a little\nawestruck by being in what is so\nobviously still a house of God.\nThat's not to say that the Babes\ndon't eventually impress....they do,\nno problem but trying to thrill a crowd that's sitting or standing on\nrows of pews takes some doing. In\nthe end though everybody is at least\nshuffling behind their altars, some\nstage dive a little too close to the\nstained glass windows for comfort,\nbut we're all enjoying ourselves.\nHaving said that Babes in\nToyland aren't everything Melody\nMaker would have you believe,\nscreaming a lot won't convince me\nthat you want to be taken seriously.\nAggression doesn't necessarily\nmean talent. Luckily though, it isn't all screaming, the songs in the set\nsung by the drummer are not only\na change but also an improvement.\nIn the words of Frank Bruno the\nBabes are a different kettle of\nkippers altogether on vinyl and\nmaybe by trying to impress the\npunters with the musical talent they\nundoubtedly have, instead of trying\nto scare the shit out of them they'll\nbe just as good live.\nMcCarter\nP \u00ab SPEX wm n our LONDON IMPERIAL\nCOLLEGE\n\"SOME VIEWERS may find the more\nviolent games offensive\" warns a poster for( oh God) the Chess Club.\nYep, if s back to school. Imperial\nCollege Of Science, Technology\nAnd Rugby is holding Its Freshers\nBall, and I'm holding my head.\nDownstairs, you can enjoy the\nbouncy castle: upstairs, there Is a Big Rave with Sun&cree m. Papa's Magic BeardEdinburgh Venue\nIf you thought London was leading\nthe 70s revival, wo ah!, you're way\noff the mark. In Edinburgh the\nrevival's been happening so long\nthat the summer of love has long\npassed and the autumn of\ngro ovi ness is goin' on. Papa's Magic Beard are Pan's People with\nfacial hair and attitude, musically\nthey're the Jimi Hendrix\nExperience jam min' with Bob\nMarley and the Stone Roses. Either\nway they're ir resist able. The sad truth though is that the\nband will almost certainly never\nmake a record let alone sell one\nbecause their music isn't destined\nfor the masses. If there was such a thing as the UK birthday party\ncircuit PMB would be household\nnames from Lanarkshire to London.\nTo make it big anywhere else the\nBeards would have to start taking\nthemselves a bit too seriously...but\nas long as they're enjoying their\nmusic as much as they seem to be\ntonight there's not much chance of\nthat.\nMcCarter\nVerve, Gravity Grave\nWhereas the class of 91 had nothing\nto say for themselves, and had aten dancy to stare at their shoes. The\nclass of 92 have tried too hard to\nredress the balance, and have been\nmade to look pretty stupid by the\nmusic press. Verve and Adorable\nhave been the main culprits.\nVerve's third single 'Gravity\nGrave' is a sign that they are\nfighting back. Their first record,\n'All in the Mind' was slightly\nflawed, and suffered as Richard\nAshcroft said because of the band's inexperience in the recording\nstudio. The second single, 'She's a Superstar' showed a willingness to\nexperiment with their sound.\n'Gravity Grave' sees the fruition of\nthose experiments. The rhythm\nconsists of a pulsating groove with\na shuffling drum beat. Guitars\njangle in and out of the mix, setting\na perfect sounds cape for Ashcroft's laid back vocal. Contender for single\nof the year.\nLeo\n\u2022 Out now on Hut records.\nREM \u2014Automatic for\nthe People\nWhilst 'Automatic for the People'\nembodies the spirit of 'Out of\nTime', it is a much darker record\nthan its predecessor. The principal\nthemes are ones of death,\ndesperation, loneliness and\nalienation. The first single and first\nsong on the album, 'Drive', is a stunning ballad. It deals with the\nalienation of the young from\npopular American society, a consequence of the policies of the\nReagan and Bush eras. It also cites\nthe inability of Rock to have an\neffective voice in the face of such\nadversity. 'Smack. Crash. Bushwhacked... hey, kids rock and roll,\nno one tells us where to go\". This\ntheme is further explored on\nTgnoreland', when Stipe launches\ninto a vitriolic attack on Bush. This\nis one of the more upbeat moments\non the album as is the wonderful,\n'The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight',\nthe prospective second single.\nThough the upbeat moments are\nfew and far between. The songs\ntend to melancholy without\ndragging the listener under to the\npoint of no return. This is a Toad the Wet Sprocket \u2014\nFear\nAnother band from across the Pond,\nbut will you re me ber them for their\nname, or for their music? Who\ncares. I hear you say, well, at least\nlet me bloody finish!\nThey were supposed to sound like\nREM. in fact they do, so much so\nthat the intra to 'All I Want' sounds\nalmost identical to 'Losing My\nReligion' (oh dear). Yes, they also\nhave a mandolin which makes the\nREM connection, but the violin is\nmore noticeable giving it a somewhat Pele feel; in other words\nthey are a poppy, folk y, country,\ndreamy band but you tend to notice\nthe former two more than the latter.\nThe stronger material on the\nalbum like 'Pray Your Gods' and\n'Stories I Tell You' begin with\ninteresting open string guitar\ncollection of songs that most of all\noffers hope. This is typified by the\nsong, 'Everybody Hurts'. Here\nMichael Stipe sings 'everybody\nhurts, everybody cries, when you\nthink you've had enough of this life\nhang on'. Stipe also offers hope on\n'Sweetness Follows'; 'It's these\nlittle things that drag you under, live\nyour life full of joy and thunder,\ncloser now a little bit'. Swathes of\nfeedback envelope the song as does\nthe sound of ad is chord ant cello and\na grinding organ in the background.\nThe theme of distortion is carried\nover in the song, 'Star me Kitten',\noriginally called 'Fuck me Kitten',\na refrain audible in the chorus. This\nis a song about obsessive love, and\nthe distortion this can give to the\nrelationship. It seems that whilst\n'Out of Time' was out of synch with\nthe times, 'Automatic for the\nPeople' is a record for the 90s in\nso much as it helps you to deal with\nthe traumas that can win your life.\nIt's a celebration of the darker\nrecesses of the human mind. It's a great record, and REM's greatest\nwork so far.\nLeo\n\u2022 Released through WE A. arpeggios creating a hung, tense,\nmysterious atmosphere which\ngradually becomes more aggressive\ntowards the end.

    "content": "Felix 945\n'eat ure23 October 1992\nMonopoly and other RAG stuff\nAn impressive turnout of 200\npeople for the second Rag event of\nterm led to a total of \u00a34648.73\ncollected in one day. This takes\nRag's grand total so far this year to\n\u00a37325.96.\nForty of the bravest collectors\nturned up at midnight on Friday,\ndressed for battle in outfits ranging\nfrom monster masks to togas. The\nintrepid band courageously\nventured forth, despite the cruel\nwind and biting cold, to lay sei ge to Leicester Square. Throughout the\nnight, any poor soul that dared to\nset foot within these confines was\ngreeted with a great cry of 'Spare\nchange for Mencap?' and was\nforced to empty their pockets of\nevery last penny.\nHaving cleaned out audiences\nfrom the Comedy Store and the\nRocky Horror Picture Show, the\nmerciless can-rattlers proceeded to\nthe bus-queues in Trafalgar Square,\nwhere they quickly instilled nearly\nas much terror in the hearts of the\nunsuspecting public as they put\nmoney in their tins.\nExhausted by their own infectious\nenthusiasm, the weary collectors\ndisbanded at around 4am, some\ngoing happily home to bed and\nothers pressing onwards to New\nCovent Garden Market and\nPortobello Road. Either route led\neventually to the inevitable - new\ncans and a clue sheet collected at\n10am for the start of the big event\n- MONOPOLY! Basically, this was just another\nexcuse for conning money out of\nshoppers whilst having fun. The\nMonopoly rules also encouraged the\namassing of treasure, which this\nyear was absolutely amazing. Not\nonly did we not have a room full of\n'borrowed' traffic cones, all of your\ntreasure was very original (except\npossibly for Burker\nKing/MacDonalds' hats and\nballon s. For example we had a plastic leg, cuddly toys from\nMothercare, a pair of yellow\nfireman trousers, several\nMetropolitan Police arrest warrants,\nvarious traffic warden slips, a Karaoke tape of 'With A Little Help\nFrom My Friends' and a'20 th Anniversary Mug' from The\nDorchester. Everyone showed that\n'Anything is possible when you\nhave aRAG can in your hand!'.\nDespite a bomb warning at one\nof the locations (Bond Street) and\nover- enthusiastic collectors being\nwarned over the PA system at tube\nstations, the day finished without\narrests, and the hoards of tired can-shakers ended by joining comrades-Raggies and well MET person\nin-cans from universities all round 1\nthe country at a massive Mencap\nparty at Kings College. A fitting\nfinale to a fantastic day.\nThe winning team was 'The\nSuperteam', who amassed an\naverage of 13282 points each.\nSecond and third places were taken\nby 'Mo, Steve and Rob' (6041\npoints each) and 'Undecided' (5664\npoints each). Congratulations go to\neveryone who collected, but in\nparticular to Vicky Owen for being\nthe top Fresher collector with\n\u00a391.74! London sightseeing guides\nwill be presented to the members of\nthe top teams. If you think that you\nhave won one, turn up at Friday's Rag meeting (1.10pm, Union\nLounge) to find out.\nWell, that's it for MONOPOLY until next year but RAG goes on\nstronger than ever, read on for\ninformation on our RAG Raid to\nnerd-land (a.k.a Cambridge).\nAnd remember to:\nBE MAD! BE SILLY! BE PART\nOF IT!\nRAG RAID\nSaturday 24 October sees the first\nRag Raid of term.\nA minibus or two full of Raggies\nwill be going up to Cambridge for\na day of hard collecting and a little\nsightseeing and drinking. We will\nalso be selling our infinitely\nsuperior Rag Mag to any of\nCambridge's students with enough\nof a sense of humour to handle it.\nThe collection will be in aid of\nLepra who, surprisingly enough,\nresearch into and care for Leprosy\nvictims.\nOur Union President is expected\nto be a regular feature on most Rag\nRaids in the near future; he\npromised to raise at least \u00a31000 this\nyear!\nFuture Rag Raids include the\nannual Poppy Day collection in\nMaidstone on 7 November and\nanother to an, as yet, undecided\ndestination on 5 December.\nIf anyone is interested in taking\npart in either event, please come\nfind me in the Rag office or at any\nof the Friday Rag meetings.\nChris Pease\nRag Raid Co-or d in at or DARE YOU DEFY GRAVITY?\nSPONSORED BUNGEE\nJUMPING\nSign up TODAY (Friday)\nat the Rag Meeting\n1.10pm Ents Lounge\nor contact Mike Chamberlain\nICU Rag Sponsored Events Officer\nPage 9\n\n"

So\nto explain...AUG M is a Union\nGeneral Meeting. It exists for\nstudents to find out what the\nSabbatical and other officers are\ndoing, have a say in Union policy\nor just to air your views on College\nand student life.\nWhat should you expect to\nencounter at a General Meeting?\nProbably Sabbatical Officers giving\nreports on what they've been doing.\nDon't let these people intimidate\nyou.

This includes a list\nof facts and beliefs covering the\nproposed policy under the headings:\nICU Notes and ICU Believes . It's a little like saying, \"The Clangers'\nwas on TV last Friday lunchtime,\nI think it's the most in-depth\nscience-fiction ever produced.' and\nthen expecting some comments or\ndebate.

    "content": "Reviews\nBooks\nInside the Firm\nI try in vain to convince myself\nthat I read no more than thirty pages\nof this book. Fat chance. Every\npage, every trough of sludge, acts\nas an impediment to the\nunderstanding of the criminal mind.\nThis vapid tome no more explains\nthe motive for the Kray crimes than\nit does how or why the publishers\nwere conned into buying the rights.\nThe only remotely interesting\npassage is when the author suggests\nthat the Kray jail sentences were\nhanded down somewhere higher\nthan the Old Bailey. This is of more\nrelevance to the Bently case,\nrecently reviewed by the Home\nSecretary, and frankly is more\npertinent to that case than to the\nKray case. The book only serves to\ngraphically illustrate the brutality of\nthe Kray murders, and to show a complete lack of remorse or even\nreflection on the part of the guilty.\nSo much for the rehab il it at ive effects of British justice.\nBodhran\n1 Felix 945 23 October 1992 I Machiavelli in Hell by Embracing Earth Madonna Unauthorised\nThat Niccolo Machiavelli has had\na profound influence on human\nsociety will not, I think, be argued.\nMachiavelli correlates to diabolical.\nThe Devil correlates to\nmachiavelli an. Intelligence and evil\nhave always had this synonym it y. What Sebastian de Grazia has done\nhere, is not merely to depict a fresh\nappraisal of Niccolo, but of hell\nitself, as a corner of paradise.\nNiccolo, the much-maligned\nstatesman, philosopher and, for\ncenturies, the antichrist himself, is\nportrayed in the light of his\nirreverent anti clericalism. His own\ndocument to Lorenzo de Medici,\nThe Prince, intimated that the state\nmust have its enemies (for 'state',.\nread 'clergy', for 'enemies', read\n'Machiavelli') and his play\n'Mandragola' made light work of\nclerical hypocrisy. This astute\nevaluation is as anti polemic as its\nsubject, and as worthy of respect;\nit is superbly argued, beautifully\nwritten, poignant and funny.\nMoreover, the world will confer on\nthis book contemporary classic\nstatus now, fortunately, the Vox\nPopuli is the Vox Dei.

This\nphotograph album of a book is a collection of snaps of the planet\nEarth taken from a space shuttle,\nfalse colour pictures from satellites,\nand photos taken with ordinary\ncameras from earth. My personal\nfavourite is the picture of wind\nspeeds over the Pacific.\nThis is a coffee table book, with\neach picture accompanied by a short\nexplanation. Interspersed were\nquotations from the Oxford\ndictionary of trite sayings and\ncultural appreciation in the form of\ncrap poetry, which only detracted\nfrom the book.The authors tell you\ntales of damage to the environment\nas a sideline. What they really want\nthough, is cash from all the people\nwho bought 'A Brief History of\nTime' and then left it unopened on\ntheir coffee table.\nBen Liddicott.\nCeltic DesignMeehan\nAidan\nThere are three books in this series,\n'A Beginners Manual', 'Knotwork'\nand 'Animal Patterns' and being a beginner I felt the former was the\nbest place for me to start.\nAs soon as I opened the book I was impressed; not printed in\nordinary text the whole book is a beautifully written manuscript. To\nmake the most of this book you\nneed proper nib bed pens but even\nif you sit down and proceed with\nonly pencil and paper you will be\nsurprised at how quickly you can\nprogress. Everything is explained\nclearly and concisely in simple to\nfollow steps. A Beginners Manual\nleads you from step patterns\nthrough key patterns and spirals\nonto Celtic scripts, page layout and\nletter decorating. If you are unable\nto produce a stunning page of\nmanuscript by the time you have\nfinished working through this book\nthen I can only assume you are\nilliterate or blind.\nThe other two books in the series\nconcentrate on more specific sectors\nof Celtic design. Knotwork leads\nyou through setting up grids and\nconstructing simple knots onto\nextending, in one or two\ndimensions, these simple knots and\nmore complicated spiral knots, plait\nwork and borders. This book is\nagain beautifully written and\nsupplemented with 434 illustrations.\nAlthough not as simple to start with\nas 'A Beginners Manual' if you can\nonly afford one of these books you\nwill find this easy enough to follow\n'Madonna Unauthorized' vaguely\ndescribes Madonna's life from her\nhumble upbringing to the 'Queen of\nBlond Ambition' that she is today.\nThe book details how she changed\nfrom homeless down-and-out in\nNew York to the world's highest\npaid female artist, in a matter of\nyears.\nEverything is included in this\nbook; her marriage to Sean Penn;\nher numerous affairs with men and\nmoney; the time she spent on the\nstreets of New York and her own\nopinions on anything from\nCatholicism to Kevin Costner.\nThere are also quite a few facts that\nI was surprised to read, including\nher excellent school report and her\nthree alleged abortions that took\nplace before and during her\nmarriage.\nThe 400+ page book is written\nin the style of a bland gossip column\nbut the subject matter is so juicy that\nthis is rarely noticeable. At only\n\u00a34.99, this book is a must for all\nMadonna fans.\nP.J. Dodd\nwithout having read the former\nbeforehand.\n'Animal Patterns' is the most\nadvanced of the set of books, laid\nout in the same style as the previous\ntwo, but needing a slightly larger\nbase of previous knowledge this\nbook will enrich your Celtic\n'vocabulary' to incorporate the\nbirds and the beasts of ancient\ntimes. Having worked through the\nother books 'Animal Patterns' will\nshow you how to expand your style,\nincluding snakes, griffins, dogs,\npeople and birds. Highlight your\nnew knot work skills with animals\nand wrap animals up in knot work. By the time you have made it\nthrough this series which also\nincludes Illuminated Letters you\nwill be capable of producing\namazing manuscript pages,\nastounding border patterns and\nimpressive carpet-page patterns.\nMaybe you want to decorate your\nleather jacket or design your own\ntattoo; maybe you are just nurturing\na longing for an insight to the sadly\nneglected art that is Celtic Design.\nIf you want to make the most out\nof this series and are serious about\nCeltic Artwork you will need a proper set of nibs. If however you\nare just interested in or appreciative\nof Celtic art you will still enjoy\nthese highly creative and well\nthought-out books on the subject.\nWhilst catering for the complete\nbeginner they are not too simple as\nto be laid aside by the already\nexperienced Celtic designer.\nRachel\nPage 19\n\n"

    "content": "Feature\n23 October 1992 Felix 945\nNo Ozone, No Go Zone\nChantelle Ward from the Environmental and Appropriate Technology\nSociety outlines the latest developments and the Government's plans on\nthe ozone layer depletion.\n'People have got more important\nthings to worry about these days!'\nretorted my friend Penny, when I told her that I was researching an\narticle on the ozone layer.\n'What's new anyway? Aerosols\nare now CFC free, and the\nGovernment has legislated to ban\nthem totally. What more can a person do but wait for the\nlegislation to come into force?'\n'Well,' I said, 'Quite a lot\nactually.'\nWith the recession biting so\ndeeply, environmental issues have\nbeen in the news much less than in\nprevious years. Nevertheless, ozone\ndepletion trundles on regardless;\nnew discoveries abound, provoking\nfresh rounds of negotiation between\ngovernments, pressure groups and\nindustry.\nThe 1990 Montreal Protocol,\nwhich set dates for phasing out the\nuse of ozone depleting chemicals,\nis now thought to be too optimistic.\nGovernments hoped that industry\nwould voluntarily stop using these\nchemicals before the deadline, but\nin most cases this has not happened.\nSo governments are now to meet in\nCopenhagen, in the hope that they\nwill be able to renegotiate earlier\nphase-out dates this November.\nMost now appreciate the sheer\nmagnitude of the problem.\nIndeed, Fiona Weir of Friends of\nthe Earth describes ozone depletion\nas a'... threat to human life...'\nwhich '...marks a critical point in\nour Earth's history.'\nEven so, why this sudden\nresurgence of interest in the political\narena? Perhaps because there is\nnow a sinister twist in the tale. Not\nonly is the ozone layer being\ndepleted as fast as 1-2% per day,\nNASA have predicted the\ndevelopment of a late winter 'ozone\nhole' over the northern hemisphere.\nObviously, this will involve Britain\ndirectly. When the ozone hole was\ndiscovered over Antarctica, I am\nsure that a lot of people in this\ncountry thought: 'That is the other\nside of the world. How can it really\naffect us?' whilst in the meantime,\nthe death rate from skin cancers in\nAustralians and New Zealanders\nwas on the increase.\nA1% decrease in the thickness\nof the ozone layer is thought to\nincrease the incidence of deadly\nskin cancers by 3%. A sobering\nthought, and closer to home than\nyou may think. The emotional strain\nany type of cancer puts upon\nfamilies involved cannot be\nover emphasised. Even if you are\ndeclared free of the cancer, there\nare still regular check-ups for the\nrest of your life. How would you\nfeel if a friend or relative died like\nthis? In every hundred people, three\nmore people may become\nvulnerable by the end of today.\nA1% decrease may also lead to\nan extra 100,000 cases of blindness\ndue to eye cataracts. Operations to\ntreat them can be difficult,\nparticularly in developing countries.\nHarmful ultra violet rays may\nsuppress the immune system,\nleading to lower resistance to\ndiseases such as tuberculosis.\nEpidemics can occur in countries\nwhich still have the diseases at low\nlevels.\nAll of these ailments will put a huge burden on health care workers\nif scientists' predictions turn out to\nbe correct.\nTests by an Australian research\nteam have proved a link between\nstunted plant growth and higher\nlevels of ultra violet radiation\ncaused by ozone depletion. Peas,\nbeans, soya and cabbage develop\nsmaller leaves, are more vulnerable\nto pests and disease, and have a lower nutritional content. This has\nserious implications for feeding the\nworld's population, which is\nexpected to double by the year\n2000.\nI know that at this point some\npeople will be shaking their heads\nin despair. They may care deeply\nabout the whole issue 'but no one\ncan turn the clock back'. However,\nsome scientists believe that we can\nif conditions allow and the very\nleast we can do is limit the damage\nwe are doing.\nThe British government has\nshown willing by signing the\nMontreal protocol, but needs to take\na tougher line with industry.\nFriends of the Earth research shows\nthat only one in four electronics\ncompanies using ozone destroying\nchemicals are planning to use safe\nalternatives to CFCs ahead of legal\ndeadlines. Also, according to\nFriends of the Earth, ICI, the\nchemical giants have been\nmarketing Halon 1211 (a more\npowerful ozone de troyer than the\nmain CFCs) to developing nations.\nGovernments and industry will\nshy away from the issues, but\nremember that both are made up of\npeople who have to make these\ndecisions. Could you be one of\nthem in the future? Some of us will\nend up working for the three\nelectronics companies which did not\nplan to use safer CFC alternatives\nahead of the deadlines. A handful\nof us may end up in Parliament.\nEven if your work is not so high\nprofile, you can still write to your\nMP and stay informed. So look to\nthe future and fight to protect the\nozone layer.\nSkin cancers often start if you are\nbadly sunburned as a child. Will\nthat be your child? As every day\npasses it may become 3% more\nlikely.\nPage 12\n\n"

He has created us all alike\nand He deals with all of us alike,\nno matter to which race, nation,\ntribe or parentage we may belong.\nThe book of Allah, the Holy Quran,\nelucidates this further in numerous\nverses and words, such as,\n'And mankind is but a single nation'\n(Holy Quran 2:213),\n'O mankind! We created you from\na single (pair) of a male (Adam) and\na female (Eve), and made you into\nnations and tribes, that ye may\nknow each other not that ye may\ndespise each other. Verily the most\nhonoured of you in the sight of God\nis (one who is) the most righteous\n(and God- fearing) of you. ' (Holy\nQuran 49:13).\nThe second verse quoted above\nnot only restates the common origin\nof man but also explains the division\nof humanity into nations or races\nand tribes and tells us that the object\nand purpose of this division was\nalso the ultimate unification of\nhumanity, but it goes a step further\nto point out to us the one and only\ncriterion, the only standard by\nwhich man is judged by God, and\nthus by which we should also judge\nour fellow- man.\nAs can be seen, this criterion is\nnot his colour, nor his race, not his\ncountry, not his social status or\nrank, not even his skill or degree\nof intelligence, but something that\nlies within the reach of every human\nbeing, black or brown, white or\nyellow, rich or poor, if only he\nmakes an effort to cultivate it within\nhimself. This verse of the Quran is\nan answer of Islam to racism and\nthe problems we are facing today\ndue to man-made borders, divisions\nof territories and the effects of\nnationalism. The Islamic idea of\nunity and equality amongst mankind\ndid not remain a pious exhortation\nbut sounded the death knell of racial\ndiscrimination in the World of\nIslam. This is borne out by the\nexample set by the Holy Prophet,\nMuhammed (PBUH), and the\nsubsequent events in the history of\nall Muslim nations as well as by the\ngeneral attitude of the Muslims until\nthe present day. The Islamic Rule\nin Spain may be viewed upon as one\nsuch example.\nThrough all his teachings the last\nProphet (PBUH) of Islam urged his\nfollowers to cling to this Idea of\nUnity. On the occasion of his\n'farewell pilgrimage' the Prophet\n(PBUH) said, 'Ye people listen to\nmy words and understand them.\nKnow ye that all Muslims are\nbrothers unto one another. Ye are\none brother-hood.' This bequest\nand the example set by him was\nfollowed by subsequent generations\nof Muslims throughout history.\nIf we look around the world\ntoday, we see the huge differences\nbetween poor and rich, hatred\nbetween black and white,\noppression of the weak nations by\nthe powerful nations, and the ever-widening chasm of the living\nstandards of people of so-called first\nworld and third world. We Muslims\nshould believe that this dire\nsituation is the result of our leaving\nIslam as a way of life and we will\nfind no solution or happiness in any\nman- made system or world order.\nWithout absolute and unreserved\nfaith in God, and in the truth and\nuniversality of His revelations,\nwithout the will to serve Him,\nwhich is the purpose of our\ncreation, and to follow His\ncommandments and guidance\nrevealed in the Quran, the goal of\nequality and fraternity amongst\nmankind can never be achieved as\nhistory tells us. There is no road to\nthe unification of humanity, no road\nto a brother- hood of man that\nknows no boundary of colour, race,\ncountry, language and social status\nexcept through the one guidance\nfrom God, the Creator and 'Rabb'\nof all that is between the heavens\nand on earth.\nThe Pakistan Society's celebration of Unity Week is a small\nstep towards increasing awareness\namongst the student community of\nImperial College and to inform\nthem about the Universality of\nIslam, the Deen of Allah, the one\nand only God. Everyone is cordially\ninvited to all these events during this\nweek, and please come to listen to\nthe real message of Islam, usually\nnot taught in modern schools and\noften distorted in the western\nmedia.\nThe Imperial College\nPakistan Society\nproudly present\nUNITY WEEK\n26-30th October\nTerritorial Nationalism\nvs\nIslamic Internationalism\nOmar Bakri Mohammed\nMon, 26th Oct, 1pm Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield\nIn Pursuit of the Lost Paradise\nM Yakub Zaki\nWed, 28th Oct, 1pm Read Lecture Theatre, Sherfield\nUnity, Dis-Unity, Cause and Effect\nShabbir Ahmed\nThur, 29th Oct, 1pm Comp 308\nProblems of the Muslim Ummah and their\nSolutions\nM Iqbal Sacranie\nFri, 30th Oct, 6pm Comp 308\nWLC Help\nHomeless\nMany homeless people are\nincapable of helping themselves.\nWest London Chaplaincy is helping\nto run a Day Centre where visitors\nmay play games like chess (when\nwe have decorated the games\nroom), and receive medical\ntreatment, comfort, advice.\nUntil the recession, the centre\nwas funded mainly by large\ncompanies.

    "content": "opinion\n23 October 1992 Felix 945\nCarparking complaint\nDear Jonty\nI am writing to you on behalf of\nmyself and my cosign at or Jagdish\nJethwa with regard to the recent\nallocation of student parking\npermits, knowing that although you\nhave no say in the matter, you are\nthe esteemed editor of the august\norgan which is the forum for our\ndissatisfaction.\nI applied, with Jag, for a shared\npermit, each of us stating\n(truthfully) that in the event of our\nsuccessful application we would be\nbringing ourselves, two other\nstudents and a member of IC staff\nfrom Clayponds to College. We\nwere unsuccessful. Questions\nspring bountifully to mind:\nl. My hearty congratulations to\nmy colleague who drives daily to\nCollege from Calyponds in a2(+2) seater sportscar, but how was his\napplication deemed more worthy of\nnotice, that ours?\n2. How can any (impoverished?)\nstudent afford a personalised\nnumber plate (q.v. BORING,\nGLF123, ish. 944), and how can\nsaid person be seriously in need of\na parking permit? (part of the\njustification of a permit supposedly\nbeing the cost of travel).\n3. What kind of a registration is\nB Townsend? Or A Wimpenny?\nAre we to believe that these people\nwere allocated permits without\nhaving a car? What is going on?\nWhat is the account number and\nwhat denomination of which\ncurrency is required?\n4. Could we please see the,\ncriteria by which the need for a parking permit is assessed? (Year\nof study, saving in time/money\nafforded by travelling to/from\nCollege by car, location of\nresidence, relationship with the\nHumanities defended\nDear Jonty,\nAs last week's front page story on\nthe new College Day specifically\nsingled out the Humanities\nProgramme language courses, I would be grateful for the chance to\nmake some comments.\nIt was agreed by the Board of\nStudies last session that from this\nOctober the Humanities Programme\nwould be allowed to timetable its\nclasses in the two hours between\n12.00 and 2.00pm on Monday,\nTuesday, Thursday and Friday.\n(Not the 'College lunch-hour' as\nyour report states.) Departments\nwhose undergraduate students are\nallowed to take language options\nagreed not to timetable any classes\nin these two hours. Thus, students\ntaking a language option should\nhave at least one hour, either 12.00\nto 1.00pm or 1.00 to 2.00pm, free\non each of the three days when they\nhave a language class.\nAs a result of the addition of five\nhours a week to the timetable, the\nnumbers of undergraduates signing\non for a language option have gone\nup to nearly 1,100 compared with\nfewer than 600 last year, when we\nhad to turn large numbers of\ndisappointed applicants away. Had\nwe stayed in the old 'corset' of two\nCollege-wide windows on Tuesday\nand Thursday mornings, plus the\nodd hour stolen here and there, this\nincrease could not have taken place.\nEven this year, it has not been\npossible to give all latecomers the\nfirst course of their choice. On the\nwhole, however, the new system\nseems to have got off to a satisfactory start.\nI would stress two points:\nnameless entity who allocates\npermits etc). In these times of\nsupposedly increasing bureaucratic\nopenness, I can see no reason why\nnot.\nIn response to the closing\nparagraph of the notification of\nsuccessful applications for parking\npermits in ish. 944, T hope that you\nwhere (sic) successful', blah, blah;\nbollocks, don't be so patronising,\napology not accepted.\nLastly, in preemptive reply to the\nobvious retort to this letter, i.e. 'sour grapes'; wrong. I presently\ntravel to and from College on a motorcycle. Let me tell you that not\neven Benzedrine affords a better\nopportunity to arrive at College\nquivering ly alert, than having to run\nthe gauntlet of numerous\nmanslaughter attempts (taxi-,\nMercedes- and van courier drivers,\net al). Of course this doesn't help\n1. These courses are OPTIONS.\nNo one is forced to take a language\ncourse if he or she wishes to do\nsomething else between 12.00 and\n1.00pm or 1.00 and 2.00pm. Life\nentails difficult choices.\n2. Many undergraduate have\nrealised that 'Europe' is now a reality, whatever the outcome of the\ncurrent debate on the Treaty of\nMaastricht. A knowledge of at least\none European language other than\nEnglish (and some of our students\nwill end up with two) could be of\ngreat advantage in their careers-leaving aside the wider personal and\ncultural benefits which such study\nbrings. Increasing Japanese\ninvestment in the United Kingdom\nand elsewhere in Europe makes\nJapanese a useful acquisition. It is\nalso interesting to note that Russian\nJag and the other poor buggers who\nwould have been my passengers,\nbut who must now suffer the pain\nthat is public transport in London.\nYours devoid of any hope of a reply from the official concerned,\nbut sincerely,\nJ.C. Graham, J Jethwa.\nP.S. My case is by no means\nunique; another in my Deparment\napplied without success for a permit\nto travel from Rayner's Lane (Zone\n5 for God's sake), again bringing\nin three other students, again\nwithout success. Please note also\nthat in respect of Q3 above, I do not\nintend to imply the offer or\nacceptance of any bribe whatsoever,\nnor is it my intention to imply such\nan offer or receipt exists, and if any\noffense has been given I apologise\nwholeheartedly and unreservedly to\nwhomsoever it may concern or\noffend.\nnumbers have risen this year.\nOnce students have left College\nit is very unlikely that they will be\nable to find several hours a week in\na busy professional life to study a language methodically and with the\nstimulation of a group of equally\nintelligent and similarly motivated\npeople. Very wisely, more and\nmore of them are coming to realise\nthis fact and are prepared to put up\nwith a little personal inconvenience\nin return for what we have to offer.\nIncidentally, it is not only\nlanguage students who have\nbenefitted from the new freedom of\nthe reformed College Day.\nEnrolments in subjects such as\nPhilosophy and History are up by\n100% from 248 to over 500.\nYours sincerely,\nEric Stables.\nDear Jonty,\nStudents at Imperial College have\nalways been accused of being\napathetic. So it was surprising to\nread in last week's Felix (issue 944)\na letter written by Alan Bailey in\nresponse to a leaflet distributed by\nthe Islamic Society ('Nobby the\nSheep'). He must be congratulated\nfor having at least thought about the\nissues raised in the article although\nhis letter is one of the most twisted\nand ignorant that I have ever read.\nThis is not surprising, however,\nconsidering the ultra right-wing\nviews he expressed in last year's issues of Felix, which many\nstudents will be aware of.\nHis references to the article in\nquestion are taken out of context\nIslam reply\nand misconstrued. An example of\nwhich is 'Western culture is brain\ndead' which is not explicitly implied\nin the original article.\nIt seems that attacks on the\ncharacter 'Nobby' matter very little\nto Mr Bailey. But when it comes to\nthe attack on the beliefs and ideas\nheld in this country, such as the\nattitude to homelessness, rape and\nstarvation he immediately feels\noffense. The fact that the system of\ngovernment in this country does not\nadequately tackle these issues is\ncompletely missed by him.\nInstead he goes for an all out\nattack on Islam. The opinions\nexpressed seem to come more from\n'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Sinbad'\nthan Islam itself. The examples he\nuses to support himself are\ncompletely wrong and do not come\nfrom Islam. Using Saudi Arabia and\nIran as examples of an Islamic state\nwill baffle many people since both\ndo not implement Islam in its\nen tir it y. Another misconception is that\nIslam is a religion, when in fact it\nis a comprehensive system of life,\ni.e. an ideology, covering all\naspects of life. It has answers for\neverything\u2014political, social,\njudicial and economic as well as\neducation, foreign affairs and ruling\netc. It can and has dealt with\nproblems in all of these areas.\nI suggest that Mr Bailey and\nanyone else who read the article\nshou'd contact anyone from the\nIslamic Society to find out what\nIslam really has to say about the\nissues raised. I, and the Islamic\nSociety, challenge Mr Bailey and\nanyone else who disagrees with\nIslam to a public debate, on the\nissues raised in the article, his letter\nor any other aspect of life. If he is\nsincere in what he writes then he\nwill not act as the intellectual craven\nhe is taken for.\nYours,\nAfzal, member of Islamic\nSociety.\nPage 4\n\n"

The\nattack took place last Friday, when\na female student was assaulted at\nknife point. The assailant is\nbelieved to be the student's ex-boyfriend. The attack was not a case\nof date rape.\nThe attack occurred inside a Hall\nof Residence from which manned\nsecurity was removed last Easter.\nThe attacker, who is not a student\nat Imperial, gained access to the\nHall without challenge. The man\nthen confronted the woman and the\ninjury occurred in the ensuing\nargument. The victim may press\ncharges.\nThe actions of College authorities\nin the aftermath of the attack have\nfuelled rumours that a cover-up is\nin operation. The housekeeper of\nthe hall admitted that the incident\ndid occur, but declined to make\nfurther comment. College Security\nhave yet to make a statement on\neither the attack or any possible\nreview of security in its wake. A number of students from Prince's Gardens Halls of Residence have\ntold Felix that this attack is not the\nfirst incident of physical abuse\nagainst female students. Last year,\nthere was a succession of\ncomplaints about sexual harassment\nin the vicinity of Southside Bar.\nStudents have told Felix that they\nwere instructed not to talk to the\npress about any of the attacks.\nAttack alarms are available from\nthe Imperial College Union office.\nPit Closure: RSM Students March\nSeveral members of the Royal\nSchool of Mines (RSM) took part\nin a march in support of the miners\nlast Wednesday. The march left\nHyde Park just after noon, and\nmade its way along Bayswater\nRoad, Camden Hill Road, High\nStreet Kensington and back to Hyde\nPark, where they were addressed by\nArthur Scargill, the President of the\nNational Union of Mineworkers,\nand Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for\nBolsover.\nRSM students are particularly\nworried by the impact the closures\nwill have on vacation employment.\n3 out of 5 RSM Mining Engineering\nstudents gain vacation work with\nBritish Coal, as 500 hours of mining\nexperience is required to gain a Mining Engineering degree. British\nCoal, though it does not sponsor\nRSM students, has a significant\ninvolvement in mining courses at\nImperial. First year students have\nin the past visited mines in\nNottingham, while third year\nstudents attended a week long\ncourse on ventilation at British Coal\npits. British Coal also provided\nspeakers at management lectures.\nSome RSM students have also\nexpressed concern about future\ncompetition for jobs. Many think\nthat mining engineers with many\nyears experience with British Coal\nwill now be competing directly with\ngraduates for other mining work.\nThe RSM will not be directly\naffected by recent plans for pit\nclosures, according to Professor\nTim Shaw, the Dean of the RSM.\nProfessor Shaw said that British\nCoal had not recruited graduates\nfrom the school for several years,\nand so the effect of the proposed pit\nclosures on students would be\nminimal. Professor Shaw added that\nthe threatened closures may lead to\na drop in applicants for mining in\nthe future, as a downturn in the\nindustry could be expected.\nAfter a weekend of high political\ndrama and intense pressure from\nConservative backbencher s, the\nclosure plans were scaled down last\nMonday so that only 10 pits would\nclose after 90 days, and a decision\non the remaining 21 pits would be\nmade in the New Year. On Tuesday\nnight, the Prime Minister\nannounced that the Commons Trade\nand Industry Select Committee\nwould conduct a full enquiry into\nImperial\nUniversity?\nAt yesterday's Commemoration\nDay ceremony, the rector, Sir Eric\nAsh, announced a review of\nImperial College's links with the\nUniversity Of London. He\ndescribed the federal university setup as 'sterile' and 'unproductive'.\nImperial College became part of\nthe University Of London in 1908,\na year after it gained its Royal\nCharter, following the\nincorporation of the three\nconstituent colleges, but the\ncolleges issued University Of\nLondon degrees before the creation\nof Imperial College.\nThe University Of London\ncurrently consists of 23 schools, of\nwhich all apart from Imperial\nCollege are funded through the\nUniversity Of London. Imperial\nCollege is funded direct from the\ngovernment. Also part of the\nfederal university are numerous\nmedical schools. The University Of\nLondon also provides extensive\nunion facilities which students of all\naffiliated establishments can make\nuse of. These include sports\nfacilities, currently unavailable at\nImperial.\nFollowing the removal of the\nbinary line separating Polytechnics\nfrom Universities earlier this year,\nseveral of the larger members of the\nUniversity Of London considered\nd is affiliation as it was believed that\nthe title College was perceived as\ninferior to that of University.\nDisaffiliation would allow Imperial\nto use the latter title.\nBritain's energy policy. After a one\nday debate in the Commons on\nWednesday, most Conservative\nback bench rebels voted in favour of\nthe Government's revised\nproposals.\n3 / 4\nReaders'\nLetters\n1 2 / 1 3 1 6 / 2 1\nNo Ozone Reviews\nNo Go Zone Round-Up\n2 2 / 2 3\nWhat's On\nin London\n\n"

'The Looks or the\nLifestyle' is in a typical vein of\nPWEI, perhaps a tad more\ncommercial than its predecessors\u2014\nthis is reflected by the fact that they\nnow have employed the talents of\na real drummer (?) in the line up.\nAlthough the album shows great\nmixed feelings and moods in places\ncoupled with consistent\nmink fucking ly heavy drum and bass\nlines, the carrying beat becomes just\na little boring\u2014the sheer power of\nthe bass loses itself through the\nalbum only due to the constant\nrepetition.\nGrindingly thrash y guitars also\nmake an appearance from time to\ntime, like in the track 'Urban\nFuturistic (Son of South Central)'\nwhich is a blend of thrash metal,\ntechno-rave and babies!\nPWEI have well-balanced music\nstyles in certain tracks in this\nalbum, drawing on influences from\nthe Far East, gospel and the\naforementioned baby-like vocals.\nAlthough melody, for the greater\npart of this album, is swamped in\nrhythm, Melodic parts do\nsometimes arise.\nAnyway, enough general '\nrambling, time to present the pick\nof the tracks.\n'England's Finest' is a typical\nintro, a load of wank basically, but\na full 48 seconds after the recording\nis put on, the listener is treated to\na wonderfully titled 'Eat me, drink\nme, love me, kill me', kicks in.\nThis gives a good impression about\nwhat 'The looks...' is about. This\ntrack could also become a good\nsingle in my view, although not\ndancefloor stuff.\nTalking of singles,\n'Karmadrome' and 'Bulletproof\nare the two tracks lifted so far from\ntheir latest opus. 'Karmadrome' is\nan excellent dancefloor track as well\nas the most listenable track on the\nalbum. 'Bulletproof, although also\ngreat dancefloor stuff, can only be\ndancefloor material.\nOther tracks worthy of merit and\nof a quick mention are 'Harry Dean\nStanton' and 'Pretty Pretty'.\nNot as good as its previous\nbrothers 'Cure for Sanity' and 'This\nis This', it is still a worthy album\n(anybody mentions NOT! gets\ndecked right now).

Let's start at\nthe beginning:\nThe bands\u2014wild entertainment\nranging from the indie scene (man)\nto the revival of Abba. Cygnet\nRing: the first band on, two of the\nmembers I knew from when they\nwere called Playing With Trains\n(and what a good album they have).\nI always feel at events like these that\nthey have ordered the bands\ncompletely in the wrong order\u2014big\nname does not necessarily mean\ngood music. However, these guys\nwere good\u2014they managed to get\nthe crowd going, keeping up the\nmusic and mixing in sly witticisms\non the standard of their audience\u2014\nand were a lot politer about it than\nThe Wonder Stuff. Cygnet Ring are\nplaying here on November 6th \u2014\ngo and see them\u2014it is well worth\nthe money and the effort.\nThe Lemon Trees: I only\nmanaged to catch the end of these\nguys and to me they sounded far too\nmediocre to deserve more than a three line statement on their\nperformance, and I didn't even\ncatch the third band Family GoTown \u2014I was far too busy queueing\nfot the bar and gyroscope upstairs!\n(Poddy's note: I saw them, they\nwere shit.)\nAnd now for the b iggy, Bjorn\nAgain, the best thing since sliced\nAbba. In fact, it has been said that\nthey are Abba, but unfortunately\nthey had a car crash and lost they're\nmemories - a pile of bollocks if you\nask me. They do, however, do the\nold seventies' marvels credit. Their\noutfits are superb, the accent spot-on and, what's more, the music is\nas accurate as the last lot. A great\nstage show includes snippets of\nNirvana, reportedly good friends of\ntheirs, and Erasure. I have nothing\nmore to say about Bjorn Again,\nexcept if you hear that they're\nplaying at a gig near you, go,\ndressed, of course, in white knee-highs, flares and star glittered tops.\nBut so to the other ventures that\nnight...\nMartin Taylor, hypnotist\nextra ordinaire and frequenter of\nICU bar (even if it is just to put his\nhands up women's skirts to show\nthem some 'close magic'), put on\na great cabaret show, strippers,\ns nog gers, w allies, and covered all-round perversion for the sake of\nentertainment.\nThe bar-fly jumping, gyroscope\n(a spinning contraption designed to\nmake you exceedingly ill), and\nvarious films shown all-evening in\nthe bar managed to complete an all-round great night out, but the\nhighlight of the night must have\nbeen the sight of Mark Leveller\nbeing turned away from the guest\nlist to make room foi us Felix bod s. S&M Bjorn Again \u2014\nErasure-ish ep\nAfter 'Abbaesque', Bjorn Again\nseem to have taken offence. Their\nretaliation is 'Erasure-ish', covers\nof 'A Little Respect' and 'Stop!'.\nThey're not the first band to cover\nErasure, Dollar having been the\nmost successful, more successful\nthan Erasure themselves in fact, and\nthe covers, like 'Abbaesque', are\nwell known. Unlike 'Abbaesque',\nhowever, the versions on 'Erasure-ish' are less radical re workings,\nthough still sounding as if Abba\nthemselves might have been doing\nit. And, while 'Abbaesque' was\nslightly tongue-in-cheek, this is out\nand out joke material.

The characters are quite\nexcessively played, just as it is\nexpected of a hearty comedy.\nEspecially I enjoyed the part of\nMalvolio who wore an upper-face\nmask. Since she was restricted in\nfacial expression, acting and voice\nhad to perform all the stronger.\nSeveral of those theatre graduates\nare black, which adds a further\nvariety.\nNear the end, there was a small\naccident which disconcerted the\nwhole company for a short moment:\nSebastian kissed an actor instead of\nan actress...But it was a vivid\nproduction in the end surprising,\ntoo.\nKristine J Valler\n\u2022 Drill Hall Arts Centre, 16\nChenies Street WC1, BO 071 387\n9629, Tickets \u00a35-10\nLiar, Liar\nAll of a sudden the title becomes\nclear to me: As two squabbling\nsisters may yell this in childhood,\nthe play is a visit to the scene of two\nsisters meeting in adulthood. Their\ndialogue uncovers their\nresentments, regrets and harsh\nmemories. These are squeezed out\nthrough bouts of anger and\nfrustration.\nThe sisters, Anna and Gill, are\nvery different people and their parts\nare played, by M.G. Macdonald\nand Kate Worth respectively, with\nvarying degrees of competence.\nIt's a patchy play; dragging at\ntimes and too cho ca block with\nangst and pain at others, and, on the\nwhole, the brevity and lack of\nfluency doesn't serve such a theme.\nDarwen\n\u2022 Etcetra Theatre Club 265\nCamden High St. NW1 BO 071 482\n4857, Tickets \u00a3 4 - 5\nWritten by Alice Childress, one of\nthe leading black writers in\nAmerica, Trouble in Mind is set in\na Broadway theatre of New York,\nat the time of the Montgomery Civil\nRights marches (1956)\nWilletta Mayer (Carmen\nMunroe), a black vaudeville star\nwho has spent much of her career\nin the role of the 'southern black\nmam my', turns up for the first\nrehearsal of a new play. There she\nmeets the rest of the cast\u2014a group\nof black and white actors. The\nplay's director is Al Manners\n(Maurice Roeves), an early-forties,\nhat less, well-tweede d product of\nHollywood. As the rehearsals\nprogress, prejudice and\ncompromise is revealed as the\nactors come face to face not only\nwith each other but with the racial\npolitics of the play that they are\nabout to perform. The harrowing\naccount of a lynching prompts a compliant Willetta to question not\nonly the attitude of her white\ndirector (considerate and\nunderstanding after his own\nfashion; selfish and tactless\naccording to hers), but also those of\nher fellow actors.\nMunroe's powerful performance\nand Roeves' vitality match perfectly\nthe challenges of the plot; the script\nattempts to amalgamate two plays\nin one forcing the actors to switch\nbetween roles. Moreover, what\nmakes Trouble in Mind a wonderful\nplay is not only that it is a comedy\nabout backstage life. It is also that\nit presents a human problem with\nall its immediacy and relevance in\na very witty manner.\nMediterraneo\n\u2022 Tricycle Theatre 269 Kilburn\nHigh Road NW6, BO 071 328\n1000, Tickets \u00a36-8.50\nI don't like yer attitude, pal..\nExile\nExile by David Ian Neville presents\nus with three different perspectives\nof a single terrorist act in Northern\nIreland. The play is made up of\nthree monologues. However each\ncharacter talks to an invisible person\n(a dead wife or absent husband etc)\nand this broadens the scope of the\nplay impressing on us that there are\nmany more than these three who are\naffected.\nJane Reilly (Gail) and Finlay\nMcLean (Peter) play the wife and\nfather, respectively, of a soldier\ndisabled by the blast. Though the\nchoice of characters is not unusual,\nthe twist here is that the soldier lives\nwith Peter. Both actors powerfully\nuse their parts to draw the audience\n('Trouble in Mind')\nin, making the pain at once\nuniversal and individual.\nSandra is the girlfriend of the\nterrorist responsible for the bomb.\nCorinne Harris plays a character on\nthe point of psychosis betrayed, by\nher trust in a futile conflict. She is\nthe unseen casualty and this\nincreases her suffering unbearably.\nThe play avoids politics keeping\nthe drama on a personal level with\nthe only cry being one for peace.\nThe inevitable by-product of this is\nthat the arb it ary nature of terrorism\nis seen very clearly; 'Toy soldiers,\nthat's all we are'. Certainly a play\nto see and muse over.\nSJ \u2022 Bush Theatre, Shepherd's Bush\nGreen, W12. \u00a38, \u00a36 cones.

Lloyd\nDear Jonty.\nI just want to give you my opinion\non the 'Pro-Life' movement, since\none of your readers strongly\nresented your description of it. I think this society deserves its name:\nnot only does it try to avoid\nmurdering unborn children, but it\nalso helps pregnant women in\ndifficulty who can't keep their\nbabies for various reasons. In this\ncase, they can avoid illnesses\nresulting from their own efforts to\nabort. Now. you may think that the\nword 'murder' is a bit too strong:\nWell, just have a look at the latest\ninvestigations scientists made on\nhuman brain cells: their new idea\nis to take some of them from unborn\nbabies to cure elderly people\nsuffering from Parkinson's disease.\nNow. I am not going to discuss\nwhether it's morally correct or not,\nDear Jonty.\n1 was interested to hear of your\ncorrespondent's complaint about the\nICU Pro-Life Society's name\n(\"Name withheld by request', Issue\n944). This name was fully approved\nby ICU in our constitution, and\nreflects the first of our constitutional\nobjectives\u2014'Affirming, defending\nand promoting the existence and\nvalue of human life from the\nmoment of conception, and to\ndefend and protect human life\ngenerally and in particular, whether\nborn or unborn.' How we can be\nconstrued as being anything other\nthan Pro-Life is beyond my ken.\nbut just trying to point out that if\nscientists have chosen cells of an\nembryo, and not those of any\nanimal, this might suggest that this\nembryo may be of the same species\nas a fully grown-up person. So,\nwhen abortion is committed, it is\nscientifically speaking killing a member of our* species, isn't it?\nNow, let's turn to these\n'complications and illnesses' during\npregnancy: if the mother is likely\nto die because of these, and the baby\ncan be rescued, who would you\nrather save? 1 know it's a difficult\nquestion to answer, but it is worth\nthinking of.\nAs for 'KKK gatherings outside\nIrish women MPs' homes', I think\nsuch meetings don't deserve such a home, since KKK was strongly\nracist\u2014which Pro-Life is not!\nThose gatherings are just small\nThe Pro-Life movement uses\nplain language to communicate the\ntruth of abortion to the public. The\npro-abortion movement sadly feels\nit necessary to manipulate language\nto obscure the facts. An example is\nthe creation of phrases such as 'pre-embryo' and 'products of\nconception' to deny the humanity of\nthe unborn child.\nI didn't see the Channel 4 News\nprogramme to which 'Name'\nrefers, but is (s) he aware that\nIreland's constitution accords equal\nrights to the unborn child and to the\nmother? Thus abortion is legal\nreminders for politically influential\npersons that pregnancy isn'ta 'disease you're prevented from\nusing condoms and pills, just like\nany other sexually-transmitted\ndisease', as E. Keeling put it in last\nweek's issue.\nBut I must agree that 'verbal\nabuse' of Irish pregnant women\nflying to England is to blame,\nespecially if these women believe\ntheir only way of getting rid of the\ndifficulties they encounter in their\npregnancies. There should be more\nadvertisements on societies helping\nthese women to keep their babies,\nand not just posters like those on the\nunderground walls saying: 'Not\nevery pregnancy is wanted\u2014\nAbortion Centre\u2014confidential\nhelp', whatsoever.\nWhat about raped women? I think\nthat rape is already such a shock to\nunder life-threatening\ncircumstances.\nThere is no reason why British\nPro-Lifers should not contribute to\nthe Irish abortion debate, just as we\nall show concern for human rights\nin Bosnia or Tibet, for example. I'm sure British pro-abortionists will be\ncontributing, as they have done\nmost vociferously in the past. I have\nheard no reports of picketing of\nDublin airport, although radical\nIrish anti-abortionists did protest\noutside a woman MPs home.\nHowever, the Irish Pro-Life\numbrella group unequivocally\nwomen's fem in it y one shouldn't add one to their maternity, for\nabortion is not trauma-free, even if\nit is made by pills such as RU486\n(see Hospital Doctor, 2-11-89).\nFurthermore, those poor women\nshould think, if possible, that killing\ntheir baby won't kill their trauma,\njust like removing a cancerous\ntumor, because he is not responsible\nfor what happened: the man's to\nblame, the baby is an innocent who\njust wants to be loved the way he\nis, just like anyone else in the\nworld.\nNow, I'm pretty sure this article\nwon't convince you at all, but I just\nwanted to give you some clues to\nthink about, just saying that every\nhuman being has a right to claim\n'Life is worth living, even though\nnot so from day to day!'.\nE.V. condemned such tactics, as do we.\nEducation, free debate and\npersuasion are our tactics.\n(Thankfully, intimidation and 'no\nplatforming' of Pro-Life delegates\nand leaflet ers at NUS Conferences\nare no longer so commonplace\u2014\nanti-abortionists are perhaps\nseeking a more democratic image.)\nI hope I 've answered your\ncorrespondent's points. Until next\ntime my 'warped and stunted\nimagination' is required.\nYours un offended, Mike Castles. Chair.\nICU Pro-Life Society\nPage 3\n\n"
