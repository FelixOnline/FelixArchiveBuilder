Called by\nmany \u2018the heart of South\nAmerica\u2019, due to its\nshape and geographical\nlocation, it is the poorest\ncountry in the region (by\nmeasure of its GDP per\ncapita and its HDI). From\nthe 16th century up until\nits independence in 1825,\nit supplied Spanish conquerors with a significant\namount of their mineral\nwealth. Nowadays, it is\nknown officially as the\nPlurinational State of\nBolivia \u2013 as it comprises in\nexcess of 30 different indigenous states. Out of all\nLatin American countries,\nBolivia has the highest\nproportion of indigenous\npeople \u2013 at nearly 60%\nof its inhabitants. Though\nof considerable landmass,\nits relatively small population is disseminated\nacross the Andes and the\nAmazon and its society\nis noticeably stratified.\nMuch of present-day\nwealth is accumulated in\nthe main cities; while poverty and lack of education\nare abundant in the rural\nzones. Bolivia\u2019s history\nis riddled with struggles\n\u2013 not least because of its\ncolonial past, but also as\na result of more recent\nconflicts.\nBack in 2006, the\nfirst-ever indigenous\npresident was elected\nafter a nearly 3-year long\npolitical turmoil. Evo\nMorales brought fresh\npromises of hope and\nbolstered a campaign\nfor the many and not the\nfew. He named his party\n\u201cMAS (Movimiento Al\nSocialismo)\u201d, which\ntranslates to movement\nto socialism. In hind-sight, MAS did achieve\nmany of its primary\nobjectives. Economic\ngrowth steadily rose\nfor the most part of his\nruling, extreme poverty\nwas drastically reduced,\nBolivia\u2019s position in\nthe international community was reinstated,\ninfrastructure was\nnationalised, social inclusion was fostered, the\nindigenous identity of\nthe country was boasted,\nracism was halted and\nprogrammes of widespread education were\ncreated, amongst others.\nHe achieved something\nthat had become long\nunbeknownst to Bolivians \u2013 unity and stability.\nThese things gave way to\nhis democratic re-elec-tion on 2009 and 2014.\nAnd indeed, people\nvoted overwhelmingly\nfor his remain \u2013 with\n64% and 63% of the\nvotes casted for his\nparty, on each occasion\nrespectively. Amongst\nthe most controversial\nof his decrees, Morales\nexpelled the Drug Enforcement Agency and\nexpanded widespread\nplantations of Coca in\nthe tropics. Contrary to\nhis promises, however,\nverifiable corruption\nscandals soon began\nto emerge. One after\nanother, allegations\nagainst his government\ngrew ever larger. Some\neven argue that his\nsuccess was built upon\nclandestine foundations \u2013 government\nexpenditure was allegedly financed with the\ninjection of funds from\ndrug trafficking, as\nmany things didn\u2019t quite\nmake sense. Of course,\nthis latter allegation was\nmade on a conspiracy\nbasis \u2013 but was it?\nAlas \u2013 as time\nprogressed, his once\nhumble origins became\noverridden by his now\npresent greed. Private\njets, helicopters, faulty\nfactories, luxurious\nmotorcades, full-scale\ninternational airports in\nsmall Coca-producing\ntowns, an unexplainable\nexponential rise in Coca\nproduction, a museum\nof himself and even the\nerection of a 30-storey\npresidential palace were\nplease those that still\nadvocated for him, he\nchose to go down the\npopulist strategy by\nbuilding football pitches\naround the countryside\nand spreading political\npropaganda across the\nnation \u2013 in an attempt to\nengage with the uneducated masses that were\nlargely unaware of his\nwrongdoings, let alone\nextravagances.\nWithout realising\nit at the time, he spelt\nthe beginning of his\ndemise on the 21st of\nFebruary of 2016. On\nthat day, Morales called\na referendum seeking to\nchange Bolivia\u2019s political constitution in a way\nthat would allow him to\nrun for a 4th consecutive\nterm \u2013 which was and\nis illegal. He lost. Notwithstanding this vote,\nhe insisted on putting his\npresidential bid forward\n\u2013 breaching the democratic foundations upon\nwhich Bolivia became\nindependent, with the\npetty argument that \u2018it\nwas within his human\nrights to re-run for presidency\u2019. Stemming from\nthis, peaceful anti-MAS\nprotests emerged and\nprogressively got larger\nin size. Opposition\nparties advocated\nMorales\u2019 bid for presidency was unconstitu-tional, which it was and\nis.\nAlready, rumours\nhad emerged that the\nelection would be\nrigged \u2013 but no one\nhad anticipated to what\nextent to which it would\nbe. Unsurprisingly, on\nthe 20th of October of\n2019, MAS won the\nelection \u2013 wreaking\nthe country into a\nProtests in Bolivia // Wikimedia\n\u201cMorales\nblatantly\nmismanaged\nthe resources\nof the poor\ncountry he\ncommanded\u201d\nbought using taxpayer\u2019s\nmoney, all under the\nfutile premises of \u201cthis is\nthe people\u2019s property\u201d.\nMorales blatantly mismanaged the resources\nof the poor country he\ncommanded in order to\ndo as he pleased, in a tyrannical fashion. Slowly\nbut surely, his party soon\nstarted seizing control of\nthe legislative, judicial\nand executive branches\nof the government \u2013\nwhich, by law, should\noperate independently of\neach other. Much of the\nelectorate that had voted\nfor him became upset by\nthese actions, thereby\nleading him to gradually\nlose the overwhelming\nsupport he once had. To\n\n"

That's just vague. I\nfeel dirty, like I've written\nsome sort of horrific click-baity thing for Buzzfeed.\nThe issue is as simple\nand eternal a fact of\nstudent life (for most of\nus, anyway) as lectures,\nexams, sleepless nights,\nor Memeperial posts:\nwe're only here for a few\nyears.\nI know, shocking reve-lation.\nHowever, despite\nthe obviousness of the\nstatement, it has serious\nramifications across a\nvariety of issues in the\nCollege community. It is,\nonce again, one of those\nthings that just pops up in\nevery conversation I have.\nThis week, it came up\nwhen speaking to Neil\nAlford about the proposed\npath across the Queen's\nLawn. Initially, several\nstudent representatives'\nreactions were of frustration - they felt they had not\nbeen consulted, and that\n'once again' the College\nwas acting without speaking to students.\nIn fact, in this case,\nthe College did consult\nstudents. It's just that the\nstudents they spoke to\nhave, statistically, probably mostly graduated.\n(Three adverbs in a\nrow. Yikes. I'm washed\nup already.)\nConsultations were\nrun in the couple of years\npreceding the announcement of the masterplan in\nDecember 2018. As over\n500 people were involved,\nthey appear to have been\nsomewhat extensive. But\nsomeone consulted in\n2016 has graduated by\nnow if they were anything\nbut a fresher or a second\nyear on a four-year course.\nThe current generation\nof students, and, essen-tially, their democratical-ly-elected representatives,\nwere never involved.\nNot only does this\nmean decisions are almost\nnever implemented during\nthe Imperial-lifetime of\nthose consulted about it,\nbut also that students actually present at the time\nof the implementation\nhave never even heard of\nthe initiative. Students at\nthe CSPB were surprised\nwhen they were asked\nabout tiling preferences\nfor the Queen's Lawn and\nthought it was big news.\nIn the mind of the College,\nthey've spoken to students\nand received their approval already, years ago.\nThis dichotomy of\nexperience in terms of\ndecision-making and implementation of the resulting choices is a massive\nproblem in terms of ever\nreaching a semblance of\ndemocracy in College\nlife. Hell, it bleeds over\ninto the Union, too - if\nanything, it can be more\nextreme, as every representative is there for a\nyear only before being up\nfor re-election. In fact, the\nroles with most responsibility don't even have a\nchance to get re-elected\nmost of the time - the\nsabbatical officers almost\nuniversally leave after\ntheir terms, as they are\nusually students who have\njust finished their degrees.\nWell, what solution\nwould one propose? It's\nnot an unknown quantity.\nDecades-long projects\nsuch are discussed by\nstudents in representative\npositions for less than a\nfull year. The timescales\nare difficult to overcome.\nOn some projects,\nyou can run continuous\nre-evaluation as time\ngoes by and more detailed\ndecisions are made.\nWhite City is a good\nexample of this. However,\nsmaller-scale projects\nare doomed on this front\n- running constant consul-tations, each of which has\nslightly different results,\nand then implementing\nthe thoughts of those\nconsulted, is just not\nfeasible when the scale of\nthe project is just a couple\nof years and the decisions\nto be made are relatively\nsimple. The resource\ninvolved would be as-tronomical, and, frankly,\nnothing would ever get\ndone.\nAnother possible solution would be for hando-vers between representatives to include a more\ndetailed rundown of the\ndecisions made through\nthe year. It could be made\na compulsory part of\nthe role that a 'journal of\nactivity' is kept, then summarised and passed down.\nUnfortunately, this would\njust result in bureaucratic\nslowdown and the further\nissue of high expectations\nor ceilings on what are, for\nthe most part, voluntary\nstudent roles.\nFrankly, I don't have\nthe answers. This is an\nongoing, fundamental\nissue that leaves different\nstakeholders in university life at one another's\nthroats for reasons neither\ncan actually do anything\nabout. Students feel\nignored while the College\nis convinced they've taken\nthe right steps. Perhaps\nthe real answer is just\nto communicate that\nbetter - to open up lines of\ncommunication between\nstudents and the Union\nand the College and all the\nother stakeholders that are\nmore effective and more\nconsiderate of the issue.\nFor example - don't\nhave a sabbatical officer\nwho has been in role for a\nfew months go to a board\nof students with many\nnew representatives and\ndiscuss a plan finalised a\nyear ago and expect those\nstudents not to be sur-prised. Figure out a way\nto communicate the plan\nto them first.\nCentrefold, Front Cover // Taja\nStrle, Wikimedia\nT\n\n"

From\nthat moment onwards,\npro-democracy strikes\nhave been taking place\nin the country. Peoples\nof all colours, from\nall excerpts of society\n(miners, farmers, indigenous leaders, doctors,\nstudents, bankers,\nbusinessmen and even\nsome people from MAS\u2019\ncabinet) have since been\npeacefully protesting\nagainst these acts of\ncorruption. Boxes\nupon boxes of crooked\nballot-papers favouring\nhim were found and\nburnt. Even deceased\npeople were reported to\nhave voted for him. The\nopposition candidates\nhave been desperately\nholding meetings with\nnews channels and presenting evidence against\nthe fraud, demanding\na new democratic\nelection be held. In\nan attempt to diffuse\ntensions and intimidate\nthe pro-democracy\nstrikers, Evo Morales\nthreatened to shut down\nwater supplies and\nfence off the cities. His\ngovernment bribed the\narmed forces to ensure\nthey remained under\nstate control; but even\nthen, after a sustained\nvow for democracy,\nthe police and the army\nrose against injustice\nand sided for the people\nengaging in the peaceful\nprotests. Never has\nthere existed so much\ncohesion amongst Bolivian\u2019s for one common\ngoal \u2013 new elections and\njustice.\nThe Organisation of\nAmerican States, an\nimpartial continental\nbody, performed an\naudit on this electoral process \u2013 only to\nconclude it was indeed\nfraudulent. There exists\nfactual proof backing\nthis claim. As a result\nof this, most of MAS\u2019\ngovernment resigned \u2013\nincluding the president\nand the vice-president,\nupon facing increasing\nscrutiny. And, to counter\nthese peaceful protests,\nMAS has been mobi-lising its populist sup-port-group by feeding\nit fake facts, arming\nthem, manipulating the\ntruth, instilling hate,\npromoting violence and\nstrategically deploying\nmessages in the media\nthat aim to victimise\nMorales \u2013 saying he\nwas debased by far-right campaigns and a\nmilitary coup ousted\nhim from office, deliberately framing him\nin a situation far off\nreality. On late Monday\nevening, Evo Morales\nfled to Mexico after he\nwas granted political\nasylum by his Mexican\nhomologue.\nAs I write this, my\nfamily, my friends and\neveryone I know is in\na state of apprehension\n\u2013 fearing for their lives\nand for their future. A\nnew transitory president\nhas now constitutionally taken office, but\nstill \u2013 violent mobs of\nMAS-supporters have\nbeen sacking buildings,\nburning buses, raping\nwomen, killing people\nand loudly chanting\n\u201cCIVIL WAR\u201d. Their\npurposes are devoid of\nmeaning, as they have\nbeen coerced to believe\nthe fight for democracy\nis being held\nagainst them \u2013 as\nopposed to the corrupt\nrule of their Machiavellian leader. The military\nand the police have\ndeployed their patrols\nto prevent the escalation\nof this conflict and avert\nbloodshed. Neighbours\nof many different zones\nhave built barricades\nto protect themselves\nagainst the threat\nposed by these violent\ninsurgents. Fighter jets\nare sweeping across\nthe skies to bring back\nstability and take back\ncontrol from those that\nare violently trying to\nusurp it.\nFrom afar, all I can\ndo is reach out to others,\nrectify the spread of fake\nnews and let the truth be\nknown. I can\u2019t help but\nwonder: Will this lead\nto the demise of other\nauthoritarian regimes,\nnamely those of Venezuela and Cuba? Will\nthis unveil a network\nof mass-corruption\nbetween Latin American\ncountries \u2013 seamlessly\ncooperating with each\nother, in an unprecedented scale? Will this,\nat long last, bring about\nthe positive change\nBolivians so desire?\nWill the new leadership\nbe able to mend the\ndamage that was caused\nmore remembered as an\ninflection point in Bolivia\u2019s cultural heritage?\nWill Morales go down\ninto the annals of history\nas a self-made farmer\nthat rose to become\nthe first indigenous\npresident of Bolivia or\nas the despotic dictator\nthat battered his country\nwith corruption? All\nthese questions remain\nunanswered. One thing\nis for sure: now more\nthan ever, the country\nmust unite and fight for\nits democracy, engage\nin peaceful processes,\nbear its multi-cultural\nidentity with pride,\nabide by the rule of law,\nlearn from its past and\nlook at the bright opportunities that lie ahead.\n***************\nI urge you to inform\nyourself on this situa-tion. Please, help spread\nthe word about what is\nhappening in Bolivia.\nThe spread of fake news\nis rampant and is manipulating the events in a\nway to make them seem\nas though there had been\na military coup against\nMorales \u2013 when in fact\nhe is an incontrovertible\ncriminal that ought to be\nheld accountable for his\ncrimes.\nin the latter period of\nMAS\u2019 mandate?

    "content": "Death of a Salesman\nW\nritten by\nthe iconic\nA r t h u r\nM i l l e r ,\nDeath of a Salesman is\noften hailed as one of the\nbest plays of the 20th cen-tury. Adding to its fame,\nthe play recently made the\nnews when the roof of the\ntheatre \u2018collapsed\u2019 on the\naudience twenty minutes\ninto the show, a mere\n48 hours after my own\nviewing.\nDeath of a Salesman\nchronicles the ascending\nto madness of Willy\nLoman, a failing salesman\n(of an unknown product)\nfrom New England who is\nplagued with disappoint-ment; in himself, in his\nson Biff, in life itself.\nDirected by Marianne\nElliott and Miranda\nCromwell, the production\nis absolutely stunning\nfrom start to end. The\ntransitions between the\nflashbacks and real-time\nare beautifully orchestrat-ed, flowing naturally and\nblending into one another\nat just the right moments.\nThe lighting plays a big\npart in this, which, on the\nwhole, is perfect, reflecting the mood of the play\nthroughout, changing and\ndeveloping as the characters and the plot do too.\nMaking the creative\ndecision to centre the play\naround an African-American family really pays\noff. The core message of\nthe script is still intact,\nhowever, some lines\nacquire deeper meaning\nand relevance thanks to\nthis switch. Although the\nscript is true to Miller\u2019s\noriginal, blending it with\nJazz and Gospel music,\ngenres associated with\nthe African-American\nculture, added further\nauthenticity to this new\nversion.\nActing is also overall\nvery strong, particularly from the Suits star\nWendell Pierce who\nportrays a desperate,\ndelusional Willy Loman.\nSharon D. Clarke proves\nwhy she is currently one\nof the most acclaimed\nactresses on the West End\nonce again, performing\nthe role of Linda Loman,\nthe loving wife, riveting\nand extremely real.\nSo, why did I leave\nthe show feeling a bit let\ndown? Especially during\nthe second act, I found\nmyselfcheckingmyclock,\nwondering how much\nlonger they would take\nto wrap things up. With\na runtime of three hours,\nit\u2019s difficult for a play to\nnot feel long. However,\nI felt that the script was\noften circling around the\nsame points and taking\ntoo long to reach any real\nconclusions.\nOverall, Death of a\nSalesman is pretty darn\ngreat. Despite the of-ten-long-winded ways the\nscript ops to tell its story,\nit is staged so brilliantly in\nall aspects which makes\nfor a mostly thrilling night\nat the theatre. Just be\nmindful of the ceiling.\nThe Music of the Night\nI\nn theatrical perfor-mances, the orchestra\nhas a supporting\nfunction, often\nlacking the appreciation\nthat it deserves. In this\none-night-only show\nof hit songs from the\nmost famous musicals,\nthe orchestra is on stage\nalongside the singers, as\nopposed to being in the pit.\nThis unusual arrangement\ngives a twist to the songs,\ncreating a unique con-cert. With musical stars\nlike Richard Balcombe,\nLouise Dearman, Celinde\nSchoenmaker, Ben\nForster, Alex Guarmond,\nBonnie Langford and\nthe Royal Philharmonic\nOrchestra sharing the\nspotlight, it was a celebration of musicals. The\nwhole performance was\nfilled with lightheartedness and warmth, mainly\ndue to the humour and\nfun with which Langford\npresented it and to the old\ncompanionship between\nthe singers.\nForster\u2019s performances\nspotlighted his exceptional vocal range, showing\noff the variety of his vocal traits from his delicate\nand tender low notes to\nthe clear and sharp high\nnotes. These dynamics\nallowed him to fully convey the range of the characters\u2019 emotions in each\nsong. \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d,\nsung by Dearman, was\nanother remarkable performance which brought\nemotion and shivers to the\nstage and the auditorium,\nenhanced the atmosphere\nand made the audience\nfeel immersed in the concert itself.\nThe orchestra performed flawlessly and\nharmoniously, with their\nclassical arrangements\nof ABBA Medley and\nQueen\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me\nNow\u201d being unusual and\ndelightful at the same\ntime. The choir, formed of\nstudents at the Italia Conti\nAcademy of Theatre Arts,\nlightened the stage with\ntheir active choreography.\nThe canon - a sequence of\nthe same movement performed at different times\nby multiple performers -added excitement and en-ergy, expressing their joy\nfor performing. We were\nespecially excited to see\nthe young singers our age\non stage.\nUnfortunately, some\nasynchrony between the\nsingers and musicians\nprevented the concert\nfrom rising to its full po-tential. The choir sped up\nunexpectedly in \u201cStep in\nTime\u201d, which made the\naudience restless and unable to focus on their sing-ing. In addition, the orchestra\u2019s powerful sound\ndrowned out the voices of\nthe soloists and hindered\ntheir performances multiple times. Microphones\nwere also not always\nturned on in time for the\nsoloists, which felt slightly unprofessional. Perhaps this was due to insufficient rehearsal, it being\non for just a single night.\nThe Music of the Night\nis part of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Series\nwhich sees the Royal Philharmonic starring in multiple concerts at the Royal Albert Hall till October\nnext year. A fun night\nwhich took fans and newcomers alike through the\nmost cherished and emblematic productions of\nmusical theatre.

We can\ntell from the \u2018exotic\u2019 but\nridiculously un-Japanese\nnames \u2013 our heroine is\ncalled \u2018Yum-Yum\u2019 and\nher wide-eyed lover \u2018Nanki-Poo\u2019.\nIn light of actual\nknowledge about Japan,\nthat sort of thing sounds\ndistinctly racist. In 1986,\nEnglish National Opera\ndirector Jonathan Miller\nmade the brilliantly innovative step of getting rid\nof the faux-Japan setting\nentirely. Instead of parodic\nkimonos and sliding\nscreens, he transformed\nit into a lush seaside hotel\nin 1920s Bournemouth.\nThree decades on, the\nset by Stefanos Lazaridis\nis as timeless as ever.\nDazzlingly white, palm\ntrees and fountains project\nopulence while curly-haired French maids and\nslick butlers in tailcoats\nenliven the stage. All in\nall it felt like a riotous\ncabaret.\nIf only the plot had\naged half as well. The\nonly modern bit was the\nmuch-anticipated \u2018little\nlist\u2019 where Ko-Ko the\nexecutioner, casting about\nfor someone to behead,\ncalls out modern political figures who would\n\u2018not be missed\u2019 if they\nwere gone. It\u2019s updated\nwith every production;\nhere, Boris Johnson and\nPriti Patel were wittily\ncastigated in rhyme. The\naudience woke up to\nroar with laughter at this,\nthen sleepily quietened\ndown for the rest of the\nperformance. Delightful\nas Lazaridis\u2019 set may be,\nit cannot hide the fact\nthat there is something\ndistinctly dated about the\nplot \u2013 rather like staging\na traditional Punch and\nJudy in the modern day.\nWhile the caricatures\nand humour were a little\ntoo in-your-face for me,\nthe pensioners in the\naudience were cackling\naway. The lead singers,\nboth Harewood Artists\n(young opera singers\nbeginning their career),\nwere very good. Soraya\nMafi was a delightfully\ncoquettish Yum-Yum, her\nsoaring soprano bringing\nsparkle to both her solo\narias and duets. Elgan Ll\u0177r\nThomas made a vibrant\nand innocently earnest\nNanki-Poo. Yvonne\nHoward, as Katisha, was a\nbit frail and weak for the\nformidable doyenne she\nportrayed, but the rest of\nthe singers rounded off the\ncast solidly. Some less-than-lively conducting\nof the orchestra by Chris\nHopkins perhaps added\nto the staid atmosphere.\nNevertheless, the classic\nGilbert and Sullivan farce\nwill be a pleasure to fans\nof the genre, and promises\nwell-polished entertainment for the uninitiated.\nHarry Potter in Concert: A magical musical evening\nI\nmagineyourfavourite\nmovie \u2013 any movie.\nNow, imagine it again\nwithout the music\nand its iconic soundtrack:\nit would simply not be the\nsame. Music is a huge part\nof creating a film\u2019s atmos-phere, creating the right\nambience and enhancing\nthe emotional tug of the\nmoment. And what better\nway to experience the\nspellbinding magic of J.K.\nRowling\u2019s classic saga\nby watching it on the big\nscreen, accompanied by\na live orchestra playing\nthrough the entire film\u2019s\nsoundtrack? The Royal\nAlbert Hall\u2019s Films in\nConcert series gave the\naudience a truly magical\nexperience as we rediscovered the 4th instalment\nof the Harry Potter series,\nall in the stunning surroundings of the Royal\nAlbert Hall.\nThe evening was ideal in every way. The live\norchestra added a special\nquality to the film, making\nthe soundtrack have more\npresence than in the usual recorded playback. Yet\nit did not detract from or\ndistract us from the plot.\nEvery note was precise,\nflawlessly executed to the\npoint where you almost\nforgot that it wasn\u2019t just\nthe soundtrack, but in fact\na live orchestra in front\nof our very noses. It also\nhelped us to appreciate\nexactly which instruments\nwere responsible for various themes through the\nfilm, from the brass-led\ntheme of the Durmstrang\nboys to the triumphant\niconic theme. The levels\nof sound in the hall were\njust right as well: the orchestra was never overwhelmingly loud, nor was\nthe recorded audio too\nsoft, with just the right\namount of emphasis on\nthe music. It was so nostalgic to be thrown back\ninto the younger years of\nDaniel Radcliffe, Rupert\nGrint and Emma Watson,\nand relive those trepida-tion-filled moments as\nHarry fought the drain,\nswam with merpeople and\nmet with Voldemort face-to-face for the first time.\nAfter the show, I got to\nattend a Q+A session with\nthe Oscar-nominated composer of the film Patrick\nDoyle. It was fascinating\nto uncover his thought\nprocess as he wrote the\nmusic. Doyle explained\nthat he composed with the\nactors\u2019 range of pitch and\nvocal timbre in mind, and\nhad to constantly be aware\nof the dialogue, sound effects and visuals going on.\nHis proudest composition\nof the film was for Cedric\nDiggory\u2019s death. Written\nby hand on a bit of a nap-kin, Doyle composed the\nmusic to capture the concurrent contrast between\nthe happy festivities and\nthe grief of death. Using\na wide spatial range and\nharmonies of suspense, all\nin time with the dialogue,\nI am certain we can agree\nthat the music emphasised\nthe reactions of the characters whilst keeping the\nemotion pumping through\nthe moment.\nOverall, it was wonderful to relive the 4th\ninstalment of the iconic\nHarry Potter films on the\nbig screen, with a flawless\nlive orchestra. I would\nhighly recommend experiencing a film live in concert for everyone.\nThe Royal Albert\nHall\u2019s Films in Concert\nseries continues with E.T\n(8 Dec 2019), Terminator\n(28 May 2020) and Titanic (30 May 2020).\nFrom Japan to the roaring 20s // Genevieve Girling\nARTS\nClaire Chan\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Its collection of\nrevolutions, coups, elec-tions, interventions and\ncivil wars is long enough\nto keep even the most voracious historian busy, so\nit\u2019s with an uneasy sense\nof d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that Bolivia\nsays goodbye to its long-est-ever serving president,\nEvo Morales. His 14-year\ntenure came to an abrupt\nend on Monday, when\nhe was advised by the\npolice and military to step\ndown \u201cto restore peace\nand stability\u201d after his\ncontroversial re-election\nin October. At the time of\nwriting, Morales is in political asylum in Mexico,\nand the exact nature of\nthe political situation back\nhome is unclear.\nWho is Evo, though?\nMorales was first elected\nback in 2006 as the head\nof the Movement towards\nSocialism (MAS) party,\non a strong anti-neolib-eral, pro-indigenous and\npro-worker platform.\nKnown nationally as a\ntrade unionist for coca leaf\ngrowers, he was lauded as\nbeing the first native president in Bolivia\u2019s history,\nbeing of the Aymara eth-nicity. He found himself\nat the helm of the poorest\ncountry in the continent,\nwith an illiteracy rate of\n16% and absolute poverty\nlevels in excess of 35%,\nand sought primarily to\ndivert the massive profits\nearned by extraction of\nnatural resources back\nto the people. The MAS\noversaw the effective nationalisation of hydrocarbon industries, increasing\ncoca leaf farmers led the\nDEA to accuse Morales of\nsupporting the narcotics\ntrade, and his government\u2019s close relationships\nwith Cuba, Nicaragua and\nVenezuela were causes for\nconcern for Washington,\nwhich has tended historically to frown upon too\nmuch anti-imperialism in\nits southern neighbours.\nIt\u2019s with this history\nin mind that we come\nto the recent unrest, and\nindeed unseating, in\nBolivia. On 20th October\nMorales won his third\nre-election, but the result\nwas immediately disputed\nand declared void by\ninternal and external\nobservers - most notably\nby the Organisation of\nAmerican States (OAS),\nwho reported finding\n\u201cclear manipulations\u201d in\nthe ballots. Upon receiving the report, Morales\ncalled fresh elections\nbut the protests that had\nformed soon enjoyed the\nsupport of the police, the\nopposition, and eventually\nthe army: the embattled\npresident had no choice\nbut to back down per their\n\u2018request\u2019.\nThe coup has prompted\nmuch speculation. Some\nobservers noted that\nin the weeks prior to\nhis removal, Morales\ndeclared void a contract\nwith a German corporation to mine Bolivia\u2019s rich\nlithium reserves on the\nbasis that the deal didn\u2019t\nprovide enough benefits\nfor locals. Given that the\ncountry is estimated to\ncontain at least 30% of the\nworld\u2019s lithium supply,\nand considering its importance in the production\nof batteries, many see\nan incentive in opening\nup Bolivia\u2019s reserves\nfor easier exploitation.\nOthers see the ousting as\na bolstering for the US\u2019\ninfluence in the Andes\namid increasing social\nunrest in the area, possibly\ncementing Bolivia as a\ncountry friendly to its\ninterests in the same vein\nas Colombia, Chile and\nBrazil. On the other hand,\npeople have argued that\nleaders of the left in Latin\nAmerica often become\nstagnant in their wedding\nto power, as perhaps in\nthe case of Nicaragua\u2019s\nDaniel Ortega. The true\nnature of these events\nwill only become clear in\ntime. For the moment, an\ninterim government led by\nSenate vice-leader Jeanine\n\u00c1\u00f1ez has 90 days to call\nnew elections according\nto the constitution, and no\ndoubt spectators the world\nover \u2013 including Morales\nhimself \u2013 will be watching\nwith bated breath.\nAs the dust settles after a Bolivian coup, we look back on 14 years of \u201cEvismo\u201d\nBolivia\u2019s earnings from\nthe sector eight-fold\novernight. These earnings\nmaterialised as improved\ninfrastructure and were\nconsolidated by extensive\nsocial reforms, aiming\nto elevate the status\nof women, indigenous\ngroups and peasants.\nThe fruits of the MAS\u2019\nlabours came in the form\nof the eradication of\nilliteracy within 3 years\nand a halved poverty rate\nalongside consistently\nstrong economic growth.\nImportantly, these encouraging indicators came\ndespite Morales\u2019 staunch\nrefusal to cooperate with\nthe IMF or World Bank,\nthus demonstrating for\nmany the possibility of\ntotal autonomy from\nglobal neoliberalism for\ndeveloping countries.\nIdeologically, Morales\nalways positioned himself\nas a socialist but the extent\nto which he carried this\nthrough is disputed. His\ngovernment allowed multinational corporations to\ncontinue their operations\nin Bolivia for the most\npart, as long as they did\nso \u201clegally\u201d. Furthermore,\nalthough his cabinets\nwere filled with indigenous people and women\nafter each election cycle,\nthey tended to become\nmore traditional and\nhomogenous as time went\non, with many citing this\nas evidence of Morales\u2019\nskin-deep radicalism.\nHowever, one of the more\ninteresting aspects of his\ngoverning ideology, affectionately referred to as\n\u201cEvoism\u201d, was its focus\non traditional indigenous\nstyles of government. For\nexample, land reform was\norganised on a strictly\ncommunitarian basis, with\nfarmland being distributed\nto traditional communities\nrather than to individuals.\nIn addition, the teaching\nof native languages like\nQuechua and Aymara in\nschools was made man-datory, and attendance\nof indigenous people in\neducation was encouraged\n\u2013 now, more than half of\nstudents in university are\nof indigenous heritage.\nOf course, it hasn\u2019t\nall been smooth sailing.\nMorales came under particularly heavy fire in 2014\nwhen he campaigned for\nthe abolition of presidential term limits, leading\ncritics to accuse his government of autocratic be-haviour. He claimed that\nmore time was needed to\ndeliver the promises of\nhis previous campaigns,\nbut this constitutional\namendment formed the\nsetup for the crises of the\npast few weeks. Throughout his tenure the most\nvehement criticism came,\nunsurprisingly, from the\nUnited States: his fighting\nfor the rights of traditional\nMorales at a press conference the day he resigned // The Economist\n\n"

The\nprocess of \ufb01nding a recipe\ntook a little longer than\nexpected as there were\nso many to choose from.\nLuckily, all of them had\nsimilar components, so\nthe one I settled on had\ningredients that I was\nDelicious home-made ramen! // Mariam Jallow\n\u201cThe making\nof the broth\nitself was\nmuch easier\nthan I had\nenvisioned\u201d\nIngredients:\n1tsp sesame oil\n1tsp olive oil\n2 garlic cloves\n2tsp grated ginger\n60g carrots\n60g mushrooms\n900ml vegetable\nstock\n1tbs vinegar\n3tbs soy sauce\n1tbs sriracha sauce\n80g noodles\nfamiliar with and, more\nimportantly, required me\nto spend the least money.\nThis recipe is from the\nfood blogging website\nKilling Thyme which\nmatched my requirements\nand pun needs.\nThe making of the\nbroth itself was much\neasier than I had envi-sioned.\nto elevate the textures\nand \ufb02avours of ramen. I\nopted for a classic soft-boiled egg with some\nnori accompanied with\nkimchi for a slightly sour\nhint. One of the things\nthat I think makes ramen\nso popular aside from its\nconvenience is the fact\nthat all its components\ncan be adjusted to suit\neach individual person\u2019s taste. While I had\na boiled egg, you could\njust as easily have had a\nfried egg, used chicken\nstock instead of vegetable\nstock, made it vegetarian\nand add tofu, or even\nused zoodles instead if\nyou\u2019re into that; the possibilities are endless!\nI found that the homemade ramen had an\namazing depth of \ufb02avour\nwhich you don\u2019t get with\ninstant ramen. The biggest difference between\nmaking your own ramen\nand buying its instant\ncounterpart is making the\nbroth itself. Instead of\nsimply pouring out a \ufb02avour sachet, this requires\na little more effort and\ninput on your part. However, homemade ramen\ngives you the \ufb02exibility\nand freedom to directly\nchoose what ingredients\nand \ufb02avours go into your\nbowl. This, mixed with\nthe addition of fresh\nvegetables, adds a different level of tastes and\ntextures compared to the\nsoft, one-note texture you\nusually \ufb01nd with instant\nramen. Another notable\ndifference was with the\nnoodles. I decided to use\negg noodles, which really\nadded to the authenticity\nas I wasn\u2019t under time\npressure to eat quickly\nout of fear of the noodles\ngoing soggy. There was\na signi\ufb01cant price difference between the components of the homemade\nramen and the instant\npacket. Excluding the\nadditional topping, which\nI admit was relatively\npricey, I spent just under\n\u00a36. This is a drastic jump\nfrom the usual 90p that I\ncan understand some people would be unwilling to\nmake. However, I would\nstill consider this to be a\ncheap meal especially if\nyou take into account the\nvariance in price depending on what ingredients\nyou decide to include.\nAlthough I admit this\nprocess is a little more\ntime consuming, it\u2019s\nstill relatively quick and\neasy to make compared\nto many other foods. In\ntotal the whole process\ntook me just under half\nan hour to complete - not\nideal when it\u2019s 1 AM,\nyou\u2019re starving, and you\nFood Writer Mariam Jallow experiments with making ramen feel sumptuous, without breaking the bank - and\nwithout requiring any special cooking skills!\nBegin by simmering\nthe garlic and ginger for a\ncouple of minutes in the\noils.\nFollow by adding the\ncarrots and mushrooms\nand cooking until soft\nthen top it off by adding\nthe stock (needs to be\nmixed with hot water\nto form a broth). Finish\nby adding the sriracha,\nvinegar and soy sauce to\nyour taste and allow it to\nsimmer for \ufb01ve minutes.\nAt this point I began to\ndiverge a little from the\noriginal recipe by also\nadding chilli sauce to give\nit more heat and prawns.\nOnce this is complete,\nsimply add the noodles\nto the broth and allow it\nto cook to complete the\nmeal.\nHowever, as every\nramen-obsessive knows,\nan amazing ramen bowl\ndoesn\u2019t just stop there.\nThere are a variety of\ndifferent garnishes you\ncan add to your bowl\nhave an exam the next the\nnext day, but it\u2019s de\ufb01nitely worth the time.\nI can no longer fully\nenjoy a bowl of instant\nramen without hearing\nmy mum complain about\nthe high salt content and\nher overdramatic exaggeration of the negative\nhealth implications.\nIt was a nice contrast\nknowing that my diet was\nbeing positively impacted\nby the bowl of ramen for\na change.\nSo if you\u2019re someone\nwho\u2019s willing to spend\na little extra time and\nmoney in order to make\nsomething healthy and\nwholesome then I would\nde\ufb01nitely recommend this\nrecipe.\n\u201cExcluding\nthe additional\ntopping which\nI admit were\nrelatively\npricey, I spent\njust under \u00a36a drastic jump\nfrom 90p but\nstill a cheap\nmeal\u201d\n33\n\n"

    "content": "POLITICS felix@imperial.ac.uk\n6\nPOLITICS politics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFlag Patriotism: Vox in the November elections and\nPOLITICS\nJulio Perez\nPolitics Writer\nS\nome political scientists argue that\nthe far right comes\nin \u201cwaves\u201d, and\nthat Europe is currently\nbeing swept up by one\nof them. Most European\ncountries have witnessed\nthe rise (and sometimes\nfall) of parties representing this radical mindset in\nthe last century; but Spain\nhas been an exception,\nor so it seemed. After the\nSpanish general election\non the 10th of November,\nVox, Spain\u2019s own far right\nforce, has established\nitself as the third strongest\nparliamentary force with\n\ufb01fty-two deputies out of\nthree hundred and \ufb01fty.\nThis unexpected outcome\nsurely invites an analysis.\nNow back to Vox - the\n\ufb01rst question that needs\nanswering is where they\ncome from. Vox was\nfounded by the more\nconservative section\nof the right wing party\nPartido Popular (PP). This\nexcision was caused by\nthe disenchantment with\nPP\u2019s policies and cases\nof corruption within the\nparty, and a belief that the\nparty had lost their ideals\nto political correctness.\nMany of their members,\ntherefore, already had\npolitical careers in PP, but\nwhat\u2019s more interesting\nis the section of the population they represent. PP\nis a party whose political\nhistory goes back to the\ntransition from the dictatorship to democracy,\nand was originally formed\nby ex-members of the\nFrancoist regime. This\ninheritance has dissolved\nover the years within\nthe party\u2019s structure, but\nPP remains the party for\nvoters nostalgic of the\nsocial conditions of late\nFrancoism. With their\norigins understood, we\ncan now discuss its role in\nthe political landscape.\nVox\u2019s discourse is\ncentred around these\nmain points: traditionalist ultra-nationalism,\nterritorial unity of Spain,\nanti-immigration, and\neuro-skeptic liberalism.\nThe main cohesive\nelement of their ideology\nis an idea of patriotism\nassociated to pride in the\nSpanish \ufb02ag and archaic,\nCatholic traditions such\nas bull\ufb01ghting, the\nmonarchy, and religious\ncelebrations. These are\nimplied to be the virtuous\nvalues of Spaniards; their\nexaltation and defence are\nthe duties of any \u201cpatriot\u201d.\nThis manipulation of\nconcepts allows them to\nde\ufb01ne \u201cenemies of the\nnation\u201d just as easily, and\nincluded in this category\nare independence activists\nand socially progressive\ncollectives. Their immigration policies are based\non propaganda that immigrants take resources from\n\u201cpatriots\u201d and speeches\nof terror against certain\ngroups such as Muslims.\nThey support a liberal\neconomy and tax reductions to both big and small\ncompanies, but they take\na more interventionist\nstance when it comes to\ninternational commerce,\nwhich is reinforced by\ntheir euro-skepticism.\nThis skepticism, though,\nis based less on disagreement with the EU\u2019s liberal\neconomy and more on\ncultural values, immigration policies, and the\nsecondary role they claim\nSpain has in the EU.\nThe question of how\nit became a force to\nbe reckoned with still\nremains. As discussed,\nthe prevalence of neo-late\nFrancoist tolerance in\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nTo give politico-historical context, we must\nfirst discuss Franco\u2019s dictatorship. In 1936, a small\ngroup of Spanish generals led a rebellion against\nthe Republic of Spain. Support from Mussolini and\nthe Nazis to the generals led the rebellion to evolve\ninto national civil war, and due to an international\nno intervention agreement to assist the Republic,\nthe rebels won the war in 1939. Immediately after,\na personalist dictatorship in the figure of Francisco\nFranco was established.\nFrancoism (the ideology of Franco\u2019s regime) can\nbe divided into two phases.The early phase of Francoism was close to the Italian fascist ideology and\nan interventionist autarchic economy: a self-suffi-cient economy regulated by the State, refusing to\ntrade with external agents. During the fall of the\nAxis powers, Francoism began to distance itself\nfrom European fascism in order to survive, and\nmore change was caused by pressure placed on\nthe Spanish economy by post-war conditions and\nthe trade blocks imposed by European economies\ndue to the regime\u2019s dictatorship. Late Francoism\nwas then developed in parallel with the Cold War,\nwhen Spain was one of few remaining dictatorships in the Western world; this isolation gave it a\nunique character.\nFrancoism exchanged their fascist values for\nnationalist Catholic ones and started to transition\nSpain into a liberal economy; their new ideology\nrepresented a turn back to conservative monarchic\nideologies of the previous decades. With these\nchanges, and taking into consideration Spain\u2019s\nstrategic geographic and military position in the\nCold War and the \u201canti-communist\u201d nature of the\nregime, Western forces (France, the UK, the US\u2026)\ntolerated late Francoism and allowed it to join the\nWestern bloc against the USSR. In the early 1970s,\nFranco\u2019s last years, he enacted a law to transition\nSpain into a parliamentary monarchy after his\ndeath. Western approval and the fact that Spanish\ndemocracy was inherited from Franco himself has\nresulted in the tolerance, to some extent, of Francoism up to our days.\nMan in Barcelona reads newspaper with headline\u201cMore Difficult\u201d, Nov 11 2019 // Emilio Morenatti, Associated Press\nBut first... some historical context\nAn analysis on the origins and nature of Spain\u2019s far-right party and how it has become a strong political force.\n\n"

Alumni of\nthe service include Little\nSimz, Ed Sheeran, and\nGeorge Ezra, insanely\nsuccessful now but each\nhad their humble beginnings with the BBC.\nFor three gloomy\ndays at the east London\nTobacco Docks a couple\nFelix music editors\npottered about like\nimposters. The event\nboasted a wide selection\nof lectures, seminars\nand workshops. Some\nof the biggest keynote\nspeakers were Catfish and\nthe Bottlemen and the\never-elusive Jake Bugg.\nDespite being some of the\nbiggest names in music\nthey didn\u2019t have a lot of\nspecific tip and tricks to\nshare. It was more just interesting to hear them tell\nanecdotes of the journey\nthey took to stardom. The\nones who truly knew what\nthey were talking about\nwere the stars behind the\nshows. Talks on social\nmedia management, collecting a fanbase and how\nto tour on little money\nwere always packed.\nAbbey Road technicians gave seminars on\nnew tech popping up in\nthe industry like cloud\nediting music software\n(basically google docs for\nmusicians) and adaptive\nmusic platforms that\nprovide a more interactive\nexperience with sound.\nMelodyVR members\nspoke about the place of\nVR in the music industry\nand how the tech may end\nup helping you get closer\nto the artists you love.\nOne of the scariest\nthings we heard was that\nTicTok and Triller are\nthe future of the music\nindustry, and that pop\nmusic may be taken over\nby adaptive AI music plat-forms. The experts may\nbe right, but I\u2019d prefer it if\nthey weren\u2019t.\nShowrooms were\nset-up all over the place by\ncompanies like Marshall,\nSpotify, Shure, Yamaha,\netc. They displayed all\ntheir latest tech giving\nmusicians the much\nneeded option of trying\nbefore buying. On top of\nthat workshops were held\nby mixing and mastering\nveterans helping producers take their work to the\nnext level or work through\nproblems they had been\nfacing.\nWhatever the role\n(musician, manager,\nproducer, journalist)\nthere was something to\nbe gained from the event.\nEven if you didn\u2019t go to\nlearn you could still see\nthe live music acts dotted\naround the venue with\nartists like Easy Life,\nCeleste and Lily Moore.\nAny Imperialites out there\nconsidering a side venture\nin the music industry, I\nhighly recommend you\nmake it to Introducing\nLIVE 2020.\nDenis Sulta takes us to the Xanadu of dance\nWe turn the corner,\nthe gray lake at Canada\nWater still at the back of\nour minds. It\u2019s pouring it\ndown, and the group consensus is that we won\u2019t\nmiss the outside world for\nthe next 10 hours. We\u2019re\ngoing into the void. That\nis how every new Printworks adventure feels.\nI\u2019m not explicitly\nblaming TfL for missing\nVirginia\u2019s solo set.\nActually, I am. So first up\nis Ryan Elliot, who wears\na turtleneck-ish sweater\nand a long camel coat.\nSuave. Only a few of us\ngroove on the 2 pm dancefloor - a fact foreshadowed\nby the lack of hysterical\nqueueing for security.\nSome guys solicit the\nillicit from me. It means\nmy outfit is on point. The\nDetroit-cum-Berliner\u2019s\nbeats grab my feet. In\nsome ways this is the best\npart of the party. The floor\nis empty. It is ours.\nFollowing Mr. Elliot\nis \u00c9clair Fifi, whose coat\ngame is nonexistent, but\nexcels in every other\nway. Starting with some\nincredibly pungent\nbasslines, she slowly reels\nus in with her unorthodox\nbeats. When you expect\na break, she leaves you\nhanging; when you least\nexpected it, she grabs you\nby the collar. Techno that\nkeeps you guessing makes\nfor some very enjoyable\ndancing.\nHaving missed out on\nVirginia alone, we got to\nsee her in action B2B with\nMr. curator himself, Denis\nSulta, in the dark room\ntucked away at the back of\nthe behemoths that are the\npress halls. The overarch-ing sensation in the overflowing low-ceilinged\nroom is dankness. Green\nneon lights, air saturated\nwith sweat, marauding\n4x4: what a treat!\nWe had to duck out\nquite quickly as the big\nguns began to roll out in\nthe proverbial hull of the\nbattle ship of the press\nhalls. Todd Terje was the\nperfect appetizer. Piano\nriffs that could resurrect\na pagan, morphing into\nsynths that then carry him\ninto heaven. He played\nWhitney\u2019s I Wanna Dance\nWith Somebody but\navoided his own bangers\n\u2013 alas no Inspector Norse.\nWhat followed was\nconstant commuting\nbetween Serbian queen\nTijana T dropping bombs\nin her mini skirt and high\nheels (Balkans represent!)\nin the big hall and techno\nprodigy Leo Pol killing\nit in the little cave at the\nback. Having seen him\nat a fairly lighthearted\nhouse set the day before\nat Mixmag\u2019s Lab, I was\ncompletely enamoured.\nDefinitely one to watch.\nFinally, the highlights\nof the night. Main course\nnumber one being Gerd\nJansen. The Gentleman\nof House did not live up\nto his name. He was an\nabsolute naughty boy,\ncausing a ruckus on the\ndancefloor, with dancers\nin drag spicing things up\non platforms both sides\nof the aisle. It was sumptuous mixing and, as with\nhis MAGICAL Sugar\nMountain set, he managed\nto squeeze in KK\u2019s\nNeutron Dance (even if\njust the bass). The lights\nalso deserve a shoutout.\nIt was at this point that\nthe pulley system holding\nthem up went wild, giving\nus the impression that\nwe\u2019re all speeding down\nan airport runway.\nAnd take off we did.\nDenis brought it all. Disregarding all conventions,\nhe opened with Queens\nof the Stone Age\u2019s You\nThink I Ain\u2019t Worth a\nDollar, and carried the\nscreaming vibe into some\nof the best techno I\u2019ve\nheard in a while. After\nspinning a few of his\nown tracks and giving\na heartfelt little speech\nabout the importance of\nclub culture, he shocked\neveryone by ending with\na little medley of nough-ties bangers, including\nDizzee Rascal and Fergie.\nHis confidence was\nastounding, even if the\nmusic selection was a bit\nunforeseen. He can\u2019t be\nshackled, and it seems as\nthough his star will only\nkeep on rising.\nMUSIC\nGuthrie Ruby\nMusic Editor\nMUSIC\nMartin Flerin\nMusic Editor\nTwo\u201cimposters\u201dwith their press wristbands // Guthrie Ruby\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n26\n\u201cScarily\nenough, TicTok\nis the future\nof the music\nindustry\u201d\nSulta Selects\nVenue: printworks Date:\n9/11/2019 Headliners:\nDenis Sulta, Gerd Janson,\nTijana T, Todd Terje, Eclair\nFifi, Ryan Elliot, Virginia\nThe assumption of the crowd // Jake Davis\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1734\nFELIX\nFILM film.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n19\nLa Chinoise (1967)\nOver 50 years after its initial release, Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s La Chinoise still stands as a drastically important piece in\nthe director\u2019s catalogue, albeit a transitional one.\nA\ns an afterthought to this\nreview, earlier\nthis year I read\nan Ali Smith book called\n\u2018Public Library and Other\nStories\u2019. While (slightly)\nirrelevant to the book, the\ncover featured a shot of\ntwo people reading on a\nbalcony with strong red,\nwhite, and blue colours\ndominating the frame. On\nthe back of the book it\nhad the pictured credited\nas a still from Jean-Luc\nGodard\u2019s La Chinoise. I\nhadn\u2019t made the conscious\neffort to immediately set\nout and watch it, but in\ncoming to review this\nfilm, the link reappeared\nin my mind; it wasn\u2019t a\ndirect influence, however\nI thought it was a nice\ndetail, and much like the\nfilm, I would highly recommend the book.\nIn 1967, the French\nstrikes of 1968 were just\naround the corner, where\nGodard made an almost\nprophetic feature following a group of Maoist\nstudents meaning to start\na revolution through\nterrorist violence; based\nloosely on Dostoyevsky\u2019s\n\u2018Demons\u2019, we follow\n5 students living in\nan (away-from-home)\nfriend\u2019s flat, dwelling on\nthis revolution they dream\nof.\nTaking influence from\none of Dostoyevsky\u2019s\nmasterworks, we can\nexpect the story to be\ndevilishly cohesive and\ndarkly funny, however\nmany a film has fallen\nshort with brilliant source\nmaterial. Not this one.\nAs is consistent with his\nother work, Godard\u2019s\nexceptional dialogue\nbetween characters takes\ncentre stage as we\u2019re\nforced into reflection\nthrough heavy themes of\nphilosophy and politics.\nBreaking from traditional\nstorytelling, Godard often\nbreaks the conventional\nmethod, dropping into\nan almost documentary\nstyle interview; we\u2019re\nseamlessly flowing\nbetween these interviews\nwith the students and\nwhat is reality. However,\nthe authenticity of these\nstudents is often brought\ninto question when we\nlook at the scenes as a\nwhole.\n\u201cThey pride\nthemselves\non their\nbohemian\nlifestyle,\nyet sit in an\nimmaculate\nbourgeois flat\u201d\n\u201cThis dark\ncomedy serves\nas a beautiful\nfilm in the\ncatalogue of\nGodard\u201d\nThe first thing you\nnotice about this film\nare the colours. The red,\nwhite, and blue (of the\nrevolution) feature in\nalmost every shot, with\nimmaculately designed\nframes and a casual\ncamera movement, the\nalmost sterile nature of\nthese perfect colours lend\nitself to a sort of falseness,\nan inauthenticity. They\npride themselves on their\nbohemian and leftist\nlifestyle, yet sit in the\nimmaculately bourgeois\napartment, talking of\nrevolution while sitting\nwith decadent furnish-ings. This is of course\nno accident, and neither\nare the colours. About\nmidway through, we\nget a quote from Kirilov\n(Lex De Bruijn) \u201cBlue,\nyellow, red. Perfectly\npure, perfectly balanced.\nPerfect on the pretext\nthat every other colour is\nthere.\u201d Almost every shot\nfeatured is heavily blue,\nred and, white; could it be\nthat something is missing\nfrom these frames? The\nbalancing of the yellow\nshould be just as impor-tant, yet we see little of\nit. It comes at times, seen\nin jumpers and the occasional lamp, but perhaps\nthings are not as perfectly\nbalanced in this radical\ngroup\u2019s ideologies as they\nseem to think.\nThey take turns to\ngive their take on the\nphilosophy, preaching to\nthe group with brilliantly\neloquent passages of\ndialogue, persuasive\nand polarising. Talking\nin terms of science and\nexperiment, they blend\ntheir philosophical ideals\nwith fact, but still there\u2019s\nthis underlying comedy.\nWith the flat\u2019s walls over\nexcessively lined with\n\u2018The Little Red Book\u2019 in\nan almost over-compen-satory fashion, we begin\nto wonder whether the\nstudents are genuinely\nconcerned with the cause\nthey so passionately speak\nof. As if to show that they\ndo in-fact care, Veronique\n(Anne Wiazemsky) sets\nout to murder the Minister\nof Culture of the Soviet\nUnion, yet in doing so accidently shoots the wrong\nperson; this about sums up\nthe effectiveness of their\nrevolution.\nOne of the best scenes\nin the film comes towards\nthe end (before the\nassassination) where Veronique has a scintillating\nconversation with Francis\nJeanson (as played by\nhimself) about her radical\nplans to kick start a rev-olution. (Jeanson being a\nnotorious political activist\nat the time, famous\nthrough his commitment\nto the National Liberation\nFront during the Algerian\nwar). The conversation\ngoes as a debate between\nVeronique and Jeanson,\neach with opposing views\non whether the terrorist\nkick start of the revolution is the morally just\none. It is rumoured that\nGodard had fed lines to\nWiazemsky through an\nearpiece for this scene, so\nit was essentially Godard\ndebating with Jeanson,\nperhaps lending to the\nbrilliance of it.\nOverall, this dark\ncomedy serves as a\nbeautiful film in the catalogue of Godard, with\na witty and astute social\ncommentary to back. Its\npredictive nature and the\nprecedence set after its\nrelease, perhaps garnered\nit more attention than\nwould have naturally pro-ceeded, but the brilliance\nin it is precisely that. The\ninsight to comment on\nthe increasingly leftist\nview in France at the time\nleaves you to wonder\nwhether the film itself had\nany effect on the events of\nthe next year, but for me,\nit was a beautiful film that\nhas clearly had a large influence on directors of the\nmodern age (I\u2019m looking\nat you Wes Anderson et\nal.) with a relative and\nmeaningful politically\ncommentary that we can\nstill look at today.\nI spy with my little eye, something beginning with L-R-B // Athos Films\nFILM\nDominic Ede\nFilm Editor\nDirector: Jean-Luc Godard.\nScript: Jean-Luc Godard.\nStarring: Anne Wiazemsky,\nJean-Pierre Leaud, Franz\nSchubert 96 minutes\nLA CHINOISE\n\n"

Once more, the\nSocialist Workers\u2019 Party\n(PSOE) won by a plurality \u2013 this time with 120\ndeputies (the equivalent\nto an MP in the UK), only\n4 less than they had six\nmonths ago; the conservative People\u2019s Party (PP)\nwere in second place with\n89 seats, recovering much\nof the deputies they had\nlost in April, which had\nbeen their worst result in\ntheir 30 years of history;\nand neither the progressist\nblock nor the conservative one managed to\ngain enough seats to\ncontrol Congress. This is\nseemingly just like where\nSpain found itself half a\nyear ago.\nHowever, several\nimportant factors have\nindeed changed. Now, the\nprogressist parties have\nshown an intent to reach\na coalition agreement for\nthe next legislature. The\nmain obstacle following\nthe last elections, which\nwas the refusal of PSOE\nto form a coalition government with Podemos\n(UP), the far-left party,\nwas overcome less than\n48 hours after the election\u2019s results were known\nand a deal was signed\noff on Tuesday morning.\nof forming a new government are even smaller\nthan what they were in\nApril. Both parties in\ntotal hold only 155 seats,\n10 less than their sum in\nApril, and far from the\n176 deputies needed for an\nabsolute majority. To form\na proper government, they\nmust not only persuade\nother minor parties to\njoin their coalition, but\nthey will also need secessionist parties to abstain\nfrom turning down the\ninvestiture session, where\nin order to become President, S\u00e1nchez will need\nat least more af\ufb01rmative\nvotes than negative ones\nfrom the Congress.\nAs was shown in last\nweek\u2019s Felix article about\nthe Spanish political\natmosphere (which I\nstrongly recommend\nreading), other parties\nwere in the running for\nthe presidency of the\ngovernment, having quite\ndifferent results between\neach other.\nExtreme-right party\nVox had a meteoric rise.\nThey entered Parliament\nonly in April, but are\n\u201cS\u00e1nchez\nand Iglesias\nsealed a deal\nfor the next\nlegislature, the\nsame deal they\npreviously\nrefused to sign\nsince the April\nelections\u201d\nResults of Nov 10th Spanish general elections and possible government coalitions // El Pa\u00eds\n\u201cAlbert Rivera\nresigned on\nMonday as\npresident of\nCiudadanos\nafter losing 47\ndeputies\u201d\nThis accord would place\nPablo Iglesias, the leader\nof Podemos, as the next\nvice-president, something\nwhich was speci\ufb01cally\nbanned by Mr. S\u00e1nchez\nin the past. The reason\nfor this sudden change\nmay be that none of these\nparties desire a third\ngeneral election, especially with the rising power of\nfar-right party Vox, who\nwon 28 new deputies this\nSunday.\nNevertheless, even with\nthis coalition, the chances\nThe Socialist Worker\u2019s Party wins a plurality and S\u00e1nchez is again tested in building a left coalition government\nalready the third biggest\nparty with 52 deputies\nand 15% of the vote.\nTheir rhetoric against\nimmigrants and against\nthe Spanish State of autonomous communities,\nwhich are strongly de-centralised, has resonated\nstrongly with part of the\npopulation, especially\npast Ciudadanos and PP\nvoters.\nEspecially remarkable\nis the situation of Ciudadanos, the formerly\ncentrist party that has\nbecome increasingly right\nwing in the last two years.\nTheir shift to the right had\nled to their best election\never in April, when they\nbecame the third biggest\nforce in the Congress\nwith 57 seats. They even\nhad the chance to form a\nstable government with\nthe PSOE, but due to\ntheir decreasing support\nof left wing ideals, they\nchose to reject this option,\nsomething which not all\nthe voters agreed with.\nLast Sunday, they were\noutcompeted by the other\nconservative parties and\nlost 47 of their deputies.\nresigned and abandoned\nthe political realm.\nSeparatist parties in\nCatalonia, on the other\nhand, improved their\nresults and won 23\ndeputies, though this still\nrepresents less than the\nhalf of total seats in the\nregion.\nOverall, abstention of\nthe public has also played\nan important role in these\nelections. Voter turnout\ndecreased by six points to\nonly 69.9% of the voting\npopulation. This might\nbe a sign of the people\u2019s\nresignation from constant\npolitical instability, especially among the left,\nwhere much remorse\nis felt about the missed\nchance for a stable left-wing coalition. However,\nM\u00e1s Pa\u00eds, the new leftist\nparty that surged from this\ndisconformity and aimed\nto offer these voters an\nalternative to abstention,\ndidn\u2019t meet their expectations and got only 3\ndeputies.\nstronger arguments for\nthe defence of Spanish\nunity, and declared even\ntougher measures against\nseparatist violence, has\neaten away at part of Ciudadanos\u2019 identity. Their\npresident Albert Rivera\nhas subsequently accepted\nresponsibility for the poor\nresults, and on Monday\nISSUE 1734\nFELIX\nOne more reason for\nthe failure of Ciudadanos\ncan be found in the\nCatalan context. The party\nwas born in this region,\nwhere they defended the\ninterest of citizens who\nopposed the separatist\nmovement. However, the\nrise of Vox, who made\n\n"

In\nreality of course, studying\nmaths is actually one the\nsafest ways to be sure that\nyou\u2019ll never see one, and\nthere\u2019s a part of me which\nisgratefulforthis,forwhat\ninitially might seem to be\na pretty dumb reason. The\nmore I think about it, the\nmore I\u2019m convinced that\none of the most damaging\ntraits of modernity is how\nwe think about numbers.\nNow I know what you\u2019re\nthinking: \u201cWhat are you\ntalking about? Surely\nthere are more importa-\u201d\nand yes, you\u2019re probably\nright about that, but if\nyou\u2019ve made it this far\nyou may as well continue.\ntoo controversial to claim\nthat under capitalism,\nprices exist. Prices are\ninteresting because they\nattach a transcendental\nquality to something\nmaterial, and so they\nelevate a commodity to\nsomething greater than its\nvalue in use. More inter-to grow for its own sake,\nand so not only is value\nconflated with number,\nbut to maximise value, the\nnumbers must get bigger.\nTo the person who lives\nand breathes the dominant\nideology of their time\n- which is everyone -this \u201cnumber \u2013 value\u201d\nlife may as well be in\nbinary. Even before you\nleave school though,\nthe pervasive culture\nof testing increasingly\nencourages students to see\nthemselves as their marks,\nand in particular to see\nthemselves in reference\nto the marks of others.\ninator of these things is\nthe definition of personal\nvalue in terms of numbers,\nand in particular the ease\nwith which that leads\nto clear, well-defined\ngoals for self-validation.\nBasically, it\u2019s a lot easier\nto aim towards a number\nfor your happiness than\nLife in three, 2019 // Androl\u00e1s Melrique\n\u201c[Prices]\nconflate the\nabstract\nidea of value\nwith... the\nconstructed\nidea of price\u201d\nThe punchline here\nis that the link between\nfeelings of anxiety and\nnumber can partly be\nput down to the nature\nof numbers themselves.\nNumbers possess a cold\nand alien quality. They are\nassociated with robotic\nlogic and rigidity, so the\npsychological process\nof associating one\u2019s own\nvalue and success with\nsets of numbers becomes\na process of alienation\nfrom the self. Not only\nthat, but the attainment of\nself-value in this alienated\nform is totally fleeting\nand illusory, because the\nnumber is ideologically\npre-loaded to never be\ncontent with stillness \u2013\nthis is the aforementioned\nnature of capital, and in\npractice it means that until\nyou let go of the associa-tion, you can\u2019t meaningfully be content. In this\nway, this anxiety can be\nthought of as intrinsically\nexistential, and it finds its\nlogical basis in the capitalist association between\nnumber and value.\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m\nnot saying that numbers\nwould only exist under\ncapitalism or anything like\nthat, or that they would\nonly become overused\nin that context. What I\nam saying is that under\ncapitalism, numbers take\non an interesting role as\nplaceholders of value, and\nthat this role needs to be\nunderstood as the weird\nthing that it is and for the\nweird things it makes us\ndo. At the end of it all, it\u2019s\nimportant for any society\nto critically evaluate the\nmeaning of its symbols,\nand that\u2019s just as true\nabout numbers as it is\nabout rambling polemics\nin Felix.\nit is to aspire to some\nabstract bullshit about\ncontentment (note that in\nprecisely the same way,\nit\u2019s easier for companies\nto aim for profits over\nbroader social goals).\nThe question is, does this\nease translate into actual\nhappiness for people?\nThe fact that we often\nhear about the negative\nmental health impacts of\nthings like intensive and\nconstant testing implies\nthat probably not, but that\nbegs another question:\nwhy not?\nesting still, they conflate\nthe abstract idea of value\nwith the essentially constructed idea of price \u2013 in\nthe market, price is value\nafter all. Essentially, we\nhave an economic system\nwhose foundation is (at\nleast in part) built on this\ninteraction of objects\nand the numbers which\nboth transcend them and\ndefine their value. We\ncan take this analysis\nfurther \u2013 according to\nMarx, the defining feature\nof capital as opposed to\nsimple money is its need\nassociation in the abstract\nbecomes inescapable in\nthe material. One\u2019s performance in school, for\ninstance, is reduced to\na set of numbers which\nare treated almost as the\nproduct of years of labour.\nThis is no coincidence of\ncourse: the school system\nas we know it today was\nborn in and modelled on\nthe mass production lines\nof the Industrial Revolution, so in a sense it\u2019s\ncompletely unsurprising\nthat the outward expression of one\u2019s educational\nThe extent to which\nculture and political\neconomy interact cannot\nbe overstated.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s\nThis is not at all dissimilar\nto the state of affairs in\nsocial media: Online,\nyour value is thought of in\nterms of like or follower\ncounts, and the negative\npsychological effects of\nviewing yourself in this\nway are not fully under-stood.

This week,\nwe are reviewing Fallout 1 the first game in the series\nand arguably one of the best.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\n\u201cMany\ndifferent side-plots occur\nthroughout\nthe game as\nyou progress\nand meet\ndifferent\npeople and\ncommunities.\u201c\nS\no, this is where\nit all began. In\n1997 Interplay\nE n t e r t a i n m e n t\nreleased Fallout: A Post\nNuclear Roleplaying\nGame. Even though this\nis the first official Fallout\ngame, it was originally\ndeveloped as a sequel to\n1988\u2019s Wasteland. After\nInterplay lost the rights to\nWasteland, Fallout took\non its own identity with\na unique backstory and a\ngrim sense of humour.\nThis was the first game\nto be produced by Interplay using the G.U.R.P.S\nrole-playing system\n(originally developed\nin 1986) which heavily\nfeatured turn-based battle\nsystem aiming to unify the\n\u201crules\u201d of RPGs. Magazines at the time of release\nsuch as NEXT Generation compared Fallout to\nother turn-based games,\nsuch as X-COM, while\nstating that:\nFallout\u2019s individual\npieces have \u201cThe potential to change the face\nof computer roleplaying\nforever\u201d.\nAnd so it did.\nBecoming an instant\nclassic, many fans still\nconsider it the best Fallout\ngame despite being\nso far from where the\nfranchise is today. Why\nis this? Well-read on and\nyou might just find out.\nStory\nThe game is set in a\npost-apocalyptic America\n(Southern California to be\nexact). After worldwide\nconflict over petroleum\nhas caused China to\ninvade Alaska, China and\nAmerica go to war. In\nthe year 2077, a global\nnuclear war occurs wiping\nout most major cities in\na matter of hours. Those\nwho survive do so in underground vaults designed\nby a company called\nVault-Tec.\nThe protagonist, known\nas the Vault Dweller lives\nin one of these vaults\n(Vault 13) in 2161, 84\nyears after the war.\nThe game begins\nhaving the leader of Vault\n13 (The Overseer) send\nthe Vault Dweller on a\nmission to find a water\nchip. A piece of technology that allows for clean\nwater throughout the\nvault. From then on, the\nplayer has 150 in-game\ndays to retrieve this chip\nfrom the outside world or\nthe game is lost.\nMany different side-plots occur throughout\nthe game as you progress\nand meet different people\nand communities of the\nwasteland. One thing I\nloved about Fallout was\nthe ability to choose what\nway I wanted the story to\ngo. If I wanted to be evil\nand kill everyone in my\npath to find the chip, I\ncould.\nAlternatively, I could\njust as easily have talked\nmy way through most\ninteractions in the game\nand get the same result.\nThe story, while being\namazing and full of unexpected turns, really shines\non replaying the game\nthanks to the immense\namount of player choice\navailable through the\ncustomisation of your\ncharacter which affects\nthe gameplay in many,\nmany ways.\nGameplay\nThe gameplay of\nFallout seems simple at\nfirst but gets a lot of its\ndepth from the variety of\nways one can complete\na task. The general\ngameplay loop involves\nthe player controlling the\nvault dweller in real-time\nfrom a top-down perspec-tive. The character can\nmove in six directions\nas it utilises a hexagonal\ngrid layout. Once you\nenter combat it becomes a\nturn-based game, in which\nthe player uses action\npoints (AP) to control\nwhat their character can\ndo in that turn, whether\nit be moving, using the\ninventory, or shooting a\nweapon.\nI found the combat to\nbe an interesting system,\nwhich sadly grew dry with\ntime.\nYou choose your stats,\nknown as S.P.E.C.I.A.L\nat the start of the game,\nand although these can be\nupgraded through various\nmeans, it is not something\neasily done. I picked a\nlow agility stat initially\nwhich meant my action\npoints were so low that\nevery fight just involved\nme shooting a gun or\npunching something\nonce, then waiting and\nrepeating this every turn\nuntil I either killed the\nenemy or healed. You do\nhave access to the V.A.T.\nsystem, a form of aiming\nthat allows you to target\ncertain body parts for increased AP cost, however,\nif every time I am just\naiming for the head or the\ngroin, it quickly loses its\nintrigue and just becomes\n1 more thing I must fix\nto my muscle memory in\norder to complete turns\nASAP.\nThe combat does\nbecome more interesting\nthroughout the game when\nyou gain different NPCs\nas companions, but the\nlack of ability to control\nthese companions made\nme feel as though I had\nless and less input over\nthe outcome of a fight.\nHowever, the reason I\nwould still say Fallout\u2019s\ngameplay is fantastic is\nthat you are not required\nto always go into combat\nto achieve a goal. For\nexample, early on in the\ngame, you can encounter a\ngroup of raiders who have\nstolen a village chief\u2019s\ndaughter. On my first play-through, I attempted to\nkill all the raiders to save\nthe daughter. This proved\nvery difficult and so I\nincreased my charisma on\nthe next playthrough, and\nthis time simply walked\ninto the camp and had the\noption to convince the\nraiders into letting her go.\nThere are many more\nexamples of this, not\njust through speech but\nthrough the use of a\nplethora of unique skills\nfrom lock-picking to\nengineering. Every task\nhas a handful of ways to\ncomplete it and there is\nnothing more satisfying\nthan figuring out a way\naround something which\nA teaser of the power armour you recieve deep into the game // steam.cryotank.et\n\n"

    "content": "ISSUE 1734\nFELIX\nCONSTITUENT UNION felix@imperial.ac.uk\n37\nRCSU\nAlex Auyang\nRCSU President\nO\nne of the principle aims of\nthe CU section\nis to inform\nthe student body of our\neveryday operations, and\nif I\u2019m being honest, our\nprevious articles haven\u2019t\nreally addressed that. So,\nI thought I\u2019d give it a go\nthis week.\nDue to the opaque\nnature of the Union,\nparticularly when viewed\nfrom the outside, you\nprobably don\u2019t know\nmuch about the internal\norganization of the RCSU.\nThe RCSU has several\nsubcommittees, each of\nwhich is chaired by an\nexecutive committee\nmember. The subcommittee names are self-explan-atory, so here is a quick\nrundown of what each of\nthem has been up to for\nthe past week or so.\nActivities:\nOne of the RCSU\u2019s\nchronic issues is a lack of\nevents during term time.\nDuring freshers\u2019 fortnight,\nwe had at least one event\na week, sometimes two.\nUsually, the RCSU\ndoesn\u2019t run many small\nevents past those two\nweeks.\nWe think that this lack\nof events hurts student en-gagement, so we\u2019re organising a few more to keep\npeople involved during\nterm time. The RCSU is\nhosting a pub quiz, likely\nin h-bar, and a Christmas\nmovie marathon fairly\nsoon. Stay tuned on our\nsocial media for details.\nLooking forward to seeing\nyou there!\nOperations:\nThe operations committee has been focusing\non organising the science\nchallenge and updating\nour sponsorship agree-ments.\nThe science challenge\nis our annual science communication essay compe-tition. The launch event\nis this month, so we are\nfinalising the guest judges.\nMore information can be\nfound on the science challenge website, or from our\nscience challenge chair,\nIsabelle Zhang, who can\nbe contacted at science.\nchallenge@imperial.\nac.uk.\nOur new sponsorship\nofficer, Aishwarya Chidambaram, has lent her\nMathSoc expertise to our\nown sponsorship agree-ments. The RCSU used to\nhave lots of sponsors, and\nbelieve it or not, taught\nDocSoc how to manage\ntheirs back in the day!\nDespite this, we haven\u2019t\nhad any for the past few\nyears. We believe that, by\nacquiring more funding\nthrough sponsorship, we\ncan serve the student body\nmore effectively.\nEducation:\nWe had the \u2018Meet your\nreps\u2019 event last week,\nintroducing our new\nyear and dep reps to the\nstudent body. Hopefully\nyou dropped by to have a\nchat with them, and if not,\nat least looked up their\nnames. It\u2019s always good\nto know who you can turn\nto if your department tries\nto pull some shit \u2013 sorry,\nI mean if there is \u2018some\nstaff-student conflict\nabout a particular issue\u2019.\nWelfare:\nAside from the usual\nbusiness of operating the\nwelfare representation\nnetwork, we have been\ntrying to organise free\nemergency feminine\nhygiene products for\nRCSU members. We feel\nthat this is an essential\nwelfare initiative, one that\nhas already recently been\nrolled out to universities\nin Scotland and in hospitals in England. Internally,\nthere has been a bit of\ndebate about the best way\nto distribute them, but the\nprevailing idea is that we\nwill find discreet locations\nin each department to\nkeep a small stash. Pay\nattention to your departmental welfare representatives for updates on this\ninitiative!\nClubs & Societies:\nThe RCSU, in addition\nto its own functions, also\nacts as a management\ngroup for the departmental societies (depsocs)\nof the Faculty of Natural\nSciences. We oversee their\nbudgets and spending,\nin addition to providing\nsupport for their activities.\nA few of our depsocs\nhave had issues getting\ncontracts and payments\napproved by ICU for their\nChristmas dinners. There\nis basically only one\nperson who can approve\nthese sorts of requests:\nFifi Henry, the Deputy\nPresident (Finance &\nServices) for ICU. Given\nher absence last week,\nthere was almost nobody\nin ICU that could sort\nit out \u2013 which is not an\nacceptable state of affairs.\nHowever, after about five\nhours of pulling strings on\nFriday afternoon, along\nwith the PhySoc and\nMathSoc Presidents, we\ngot everything approved\nand ready to go.\nThis blatant inefficiency indicates a clear need\nfor reform regarding the\nway ICU processes the\nfinances of its clubs and\nsocieties. I\u2019ve heard a\nsimilar sentiment echoed\nby Union President,\nAbhijay Sood. We hope/\nexpect that he takes action\nto improve this system.\nIf you have any\nquestions or comments\non anything we\u2019ve been\ndoing, feel free to get in\ntouch with me via my\nemail, rcsupres@ic.ac.uk.\nIf you enjoy these more\ninformative articles and\nwould like to see more\nof them in future, or have\nanything else you would\nlike addressed, please let\nme know.\nThanks for reading \u2013\nand have a great week!\n\n"

The\nvideos created are often\nincredibly realistic and\ncan be easily mistaken\nfor real life. The software\nhas been used to create\npornographic videos of\ncelebrities, videos of politicians saying outrageous\nthings and videos of\npublic figures endorsing\nproducts. The scale of the\nproblem has caused a lot\nof concern in the political\nworld and there has been\ntalk of regulating its use.\nMembers of Parliament\nwould perhaps be better\nserved looking closer to\nhome. Today the NegaFelix investigative team\nreveals how Imperial\nCollege lecturers use deep\nfake software to create\nfake Panopto recordings.\nLecturers plaster their\nface onto footage of\nanother lecturer to avoid\nhaving to attend lectures\nthemselves. One user of\nthis method agreed to\nspeak to the team off the\nrecord.\n\u201cThere are never any\nstudents there anyway.\nThis way I can pre-record\nall my lectures at the\nbeginning of the year\nand get on with doing my\nactual research.\u201d\nThe endemic nature\nof the problem was highlighted when investigators\nnoticed that all of the lecturers were using the same\nvideo footage to base their\ndeep fake lectures on.\nCloser inspection revealed\nthat this video was in fact\nfrom 2007 suggesting that\nnot a single lecture had\nbeen recorded in person\nsince then.\nA different anonymous\nsource admitted that they\nused the time freed up by\ntheir Panopto deep fakes\nto stay in bed longer.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t stand 9 am\nlectures. That was my\nmain reason for starting,\nan extra hour in bed, but\nit was all so easy that I\ncouldn\u2019t resist doing the\nrest of the lectures that\nway.\u201d\nUnfortunately, the\nroots of the problem are\nso deep that it will take\nmore than a simple investigation to end this kind\nof behaviour. When the\ninvestigative team tried\nto contact Alice Ghast\u2019s\noffice for a comment an\nautomated message told\nthem to \u201cBugger off\u201d.\nI don\u2019t think this render quite worked // Wikimedia\nPanopto deepfake expos\u00e9!\nThis week you decide to\nget in touch with your\ninner self.\n-You schedule an\nappointment for bowel\nsurgery.\nThis week College\nadvises you to choose a\nnew path.\n-They\u2019re building one\nacross Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nThis week Panopto is\ndown for maintenance\nso you decide to read\nthe notes at 2 times the\nnormal speed.\nThis week you accuse\nyourself of sexism\non Imperial College\nExposed. Maybe now\npeople will talk about\nyou.\nThis week you finally get\nthat large tumor on your\nface checked up.\n-The doctor tells you you\njust have a really, really\nlarge nose.\nThis week you\u2019re Prince\nHarry and Meghan\nMarkle.\n-You\u2019re expecting a car\ncrash in Paris any week\nnow.\nThis week you start a\ndating app for incels.\n-You can only swipe left.\nThis week you write for\ncomment and politics.\n-Felix encourages\nintersectionality.\nThis week love will\nfinally come into your\nlife, but will fail to\novercome the hatred.\nThis week you start your\nnew modelling career\n-You buy \u00a3100 worth of\nImperial fists.\nThis week you\u2019re a\nFelix major.

This gives\nit a very 1950s America\nfeel which is especially\nprominent in the music of\nthe series. Unfortunately,\nthe first game in the series\ndid not push this very far,\nwith only one song in the\nsoundtrack being particularly memorable.\nMaybe by the Inkspots\n(1940) plays occasionally\nthroughout the game,\nlending a somewhat\npositive atmosphere to the\ndreary setting. This clear\ndichotomy produces a\nvery unique feeling which\nno other game soundtrack\nhas replicated that I can\nthink of.\nThe remainder of the\nsoundtrack consists of\ncreepy ambient noises,\naccompanied by sounds\nof clanking metal and\nspine-chilling synth-line instruments. This\ncreated a sense of tension\nwhich remained with me\nwhenever I would boot\nup the game. It took a\nlong time to get used to\nwhich shows just how\ngood Mark Morgan (the\ncomposer) was at creating\na feeling of survival and\nloneliness.\nThat said there felt like\nin the background to keep\nmy ears interested. 10/10\nfor immersion but I would\nhave enjoyed something\nmore memorable.\nArt\nWhile many may\ndisagree, I personally\nLOVED the art style of\nFallout. The metallic\ncolour pallet combined\nwith the isometric view\ngave a sense of a very\nmakeshift world. What\nI mean by this is that all\nthe settlements in the\ngame while unique in\ndesign all felt unified\nunder a common theme.\nThis theme being that\nthey were built quickly\nand unplanned through\nwhatever resources could\nbe scavenged.\nThe main point to\nwrite home about is the\n\u201cTalking Heads\u201d. These\nare certain characters in\nthe game which, when\nspoken to, will be fully\nvoice-acted (amazingly\nmight I add), as well\nas having very detailed\nanimations of the face.\nThis makes it feel like\nyou are actually speaking\nto a person rather than it\njust being a still face with\nsome shoddy voice acting.\nThe heads can be jarring\nat first but when you get\nused to the art style you\ncan really appreciate what\nthey were going for.\nWhen designing these\nheads, real models were\nmade with different\nfacial expressions and\nthe GURPS system was\nable to create a transition\nfrom one to the other.\nThe ability to understand\nthe way the conversation\nwas going entirely from\nthe facial expressions of\nwho you were talking\nto is purely brilliant and\nsomething which I believe\nshould be implemented\nfar more, even today.\nLegacy\nFallouts legacy is one\nwhich cannot be under-stated. While many argue\nthe sequel, Fallout 2, is\nbetter, this original paved\nthe way for future CRPGs.\nCNET Gamecenter\u2019s\nMark H. Walker wrote,\n\u201cThe RPG genre was\nclearly in a slump in the\nmid-\u201990s, but in August\n1997 the renaissance\nbegan when Interplay\u2019s Fallout hit store\nshelves.\u201d\nI could not agree more\nwith this sentiment. It has\nbeen ranked in the top 20\nPC games of all time many\nyears by IGN, PC gamer\nand PC zone. And in 2012\nwas even exhibited in the\nSmithsonian American\nArt Museum.\nThe gameplay was\ninspired by games such\nas X-COM and has gone\non to change the face of\nCRPGs for years. The\nart has been put on show\nin museums. The setting\nspawned a massively\nsuccessful series. Whether\nor not you think Fallout\ndeserves the praise it\ngets as a game in its own\nright, one cannot deny the\nimpact it has had on the\ngaming industry.\nScore\nOverall the game was a\nblast to play. I have never\nreally played a game quite\nlike it, despite playing\nso many that have taken\ninspiration from it. The\ncombat can be boring and\nsometimes aspects of the\ngame are very difficult to\nfigure out, such as how\nto get the most out of a\ncompanion. However, the\nsetting and atmosphere\nare unique and the ability\nto truly influence the story\nin a multitude of ways\nmakes this an instant\nclassic, definitely deserving of game of the year in\n1997.\nI would rate it 88%.\nIt is a must-play for a\nfan of older PC games, a\nfan of RPGs and a fan of\nany game that makes you\nthink for yourself. If you\ncan get over the occasional bit of confusion with\nthe mechanics then you\nwill have a blast.\nThe VATS system. You can target limbs of any enemy in the game for additional damage but decreased accuracy // Superadventuresingaming\nlittle variety and after a\nwhile, I would find myself\nputting on different music\n\n"

In a world\nwhere \u2018sustainability\u2019 is\nall the rage, you might be\ndrawn to the chocolate\nbar with a small green\nleaf on it, making promises of \u2018sustainably sourced\ncocoa\u2019 and \u2018ethical\nfarming\u2019. By picking this\nbar over another brand\nwhich lacks these labels,\nyou might be falling to\nthe traps of greenwash-ing. So how do we know\nwho to trust?\nWhat is greenwash-ing\nYou\u2019ve probably heard\nof whitewashing, which\nis the practice of covering\nup scandalous stories by\npresenting a biased view\nof the facts. The less\nwell-known term \u2018greenwashing\u2019 was coined\nby environmentalist Jay\nWesterveld in 1986 and\ndescribes the corporate\npractice of making\nmisleading or deceptive\nclaims about the sustainability of products, goals\nor policies. This ranges\nfrom simply changing\nthe name/packaging of a\nproduct to ridiculously\nexpensive marketing cam-paigns. Many greenwash-ing practices are almost\nimpossible to spot and\nonly come to light when\nthe company\u2019s spending\ndifferences are analysed\nmore closely. In many\ncases, more money/time\nis spent on advertising\nthe idea of being environmentally conscious than\nactually spent on ethical\nand sustainable practices.\nOrigins and examples\nof greenwashing\nIn the mid-1980s,\nconsumers received the\nmajority of their information about products from\ntelevision, radio and print\nmedia. Without the current\nluxury of the Internet\nto check facts within\nseconds, companies were\nable to mislead people to\nbelieve in their alleged\nsustainable practices. The\nmost notable example is\n\u2018The People Do\u2019campaign\nran by Chevron, a big oil\ncompany. In the 1980s,\nThe company made commercials centred around\nhow \u2018environmentally\nfriendly\u2019 their business\nwas, while simultaneously\nviolating the Clean Water\nAct, the Clean Air act and\nalso causing damaging\nwildlife with massive oil\nspills.\nAnother classic green-washing case is that of\nVolkswagen. By fitting\ntheir vehicles with a\ndevice which could detect\nwhen it was undergoing\nan emissions test, the\ncompany was able to\ncheat these results by\ntemporarily altering the\ncar\u2019s performance. At the\nsame time, the company\nSUSTAINABILITY\nGreenwashing often involves using the colour green to mislead consumers // Pixabay\nSUSTAINABILITY\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019 FELIX\nsustainability.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nDunin-Borkowska\nAleksandra A\nSustainability Writers\nfilled their marketing\ncampaigns with claims\nof low-emission engines,\nwhich in reality produced\n40 times more pollutants\nthan consumers were led\nto believe.\nGreenwashing has\nchanged dramatically\nover the last few decades\nand the usage of the\nterm didn\u2019t take off until\nrecently, which coincided with the increase\nin demand for greener\npractices. As a result of\nthe growing awareness of\ngreenwashing, the sale of\nany plastics labelled and\nmarketed as \u2018biodegradable\u2019 or \u2018compostable\u2019\nare banned in California.\nIt was recognised that\nthese claims were often\nhighly misleading or\nsimply wrong, especially\nwith regards to how\nquickly the product will\nbiodegrade. Consumers\nwould buy these plastics\nthinking that they were\nthe better option, envi-ronmentally-speaking,\nwhen in fact there was no\ndifference. In early 2017,\nWalmart paid a penalty of\nalmost $1 million to settle\nallegations accusing the\ncorporation of violating\nthis exact law.\nWhy should you care\nabout greenwashing?\nGreenwashing is the\nenemy of sustainability\nand is hiding a much\nlarger problem. On the\nsurface, it is a marketing\nploy designed to trick\nconsumers into buying\na given product. This\nmay lead to consumer\nscepticism of all green\nclaims, which diminishes\nthe power of sustainable\nand ethical companies.\nAt its core, greenwashing\nincentivises something\nthat many be harming the\nenvironment.\nBrainwashing or green-washing? How to avoid\nthe common pitfalls\nAs sustainability and\ngreen practices continue\nto grow in popularity,\nso does the use of terms\nsuch as \u2018eco-friendly\u2019,\n\u2018compostable\u2019, \u2018ethical\u2019\nand \u2018biodegradable\u2019. The\nproblem with those terms\nis that many are not well\nunderstood by the public,\nand it allows brands to\nbe ambiguous about their\nenvironmental commit-ments, hence allowing for\neasy greenwashing.\nHere are some tips for\nhow to avoid being green-washed:\n1. Do you see an\namazing \u2018green\u2019 claim\nGreenwashing\nhas changed\ndramatically\nover the last\nfew decades\nand the usage\nof the term\ndidn\u2019t take off\nuntil recently,\nthat seems too good to\nbe true? Double check it\non their website to see if\nthey are overstating their\nintentions.\n2. Do you see suggestive pictures? Images such\nas beautiful nature scenes\nand use of the colour\ngreen will lead you to\nbelieve that the product is\nnature, even if this is not\nthe case.\n3. How transparent\nis the company? When\nyou check their website,\nyou\u2019re should see a lot of\ninformation, instead of the\nusual vague and unspecific descriptions that are\ncommon in greenwashing.\n4. Does the ad use\nmisleading buzz words\nthat doesn\u2019t have any real\nmeaning? Throwing in\nwords like \u2018eco-friendly\u2019\nor \u2018green\u2019 without any\ncertifications, third party\nendorsement or real facts\nsuggest that these claims\nare unlikely to be true.\n5. What is your\ninstinct? We all know that\nadvertising and marketing\nshould never be taken\nat face value and we are\nvery good at recognising\nwhen there is something\noff about it.\nConclusion\nDespite the abundance of greenwashing\npractices, there is hope.\nCompanies are practicing\ngreenwashing due to the\npressure the public is\nputting on them, which is\nalready a step in the right\ndirection. By reading\nthe labels, doing a bit of\nresearch and spreading\nawareness, it\u2019s definitely\npossible to avoid most\ngreenwashing and make\nprogress in eliminating it\nfor good.\n32\n\n"

The\ntracks on the album aren\u2019t\nabout head-spinning,\nchest-swelling love\nanymore but now have\nmore complexities, complications and none of the\nnaivety previously seen.\nThe band aren\u2019t clamour-ing for arena-rock status,\nthey\u2019re just happy making\ngood music which shows\nin the bookish & fuzzy\naesthetic of the album.\nMoving away from the\nbouncy ballad young love\nfound on their previous\nalbum Belong, Days of\nAbandon is subtler and\nmore graceful. The first\nsong on the album, \u2018Art\nSmock\u2019 might just be the\nmost delicate song on the\nalbum but more tellingly,\nit\u2019s easily the most nostalgic as well; a sweet-and-sour remembrance of a\nrelationship-that-wasn\u2019t.\nThe lyrics are sensitive\n& sublime, and the hook\nhits devastatingly close to\nhome but still feels tender:\n\u201cShould have guessed it\nwas going to fall/To pieces\nin my hands again\u201d. From\nthe very first notes, \u2018Art\nSmock\u2019 feels more reflective and wistful. It\u2019s a look\nat the present through\nthe lens of the past, in\nwhich Berman allows a\nlived-in experience step\nin and take over resulting\nin untampered passion.\nThe next song \u2018Simple\nand Sure\u2019 is bursting\nwith breezy and tight\narrangements, meditative\nmelodies, and beautifully\npoignant lyricism, making\nit a simultaneously boyish\nand mature exploration\nof love, longing and\neverything in-between.\n\u2018Life After Life\u2019 lyrics:\n\u201cThe flowers he gave me\nhave wilted/ But I keep\nthem, like I keep him\u201d\ntell us that not all love\nlasts forever and most\ndries up like flowers in\na vase\u2014but with every\nheartbreak comes a\nwell-earned lesson, a\nsouvenir to keep until the\nnext one comes along.\nThe next tracks \u2018Coral\n& Gold\u2019, \u2018Beautiful\nYou\u2019, \u2018Masokissed\u2019 and\n\u2018Until the Sun Explodes\u2019\nall feel like they have\nsome sort of wrinkles\u2014\nanxious memories, telling\nrecollections, none-too-idyllic scenes from the\npast\u2014which are all over\nAbandon. Berman\u2019s certainly turned in sweeter,\nmore rousing sets, but he\u2019s\nneverwrittenanythingthat\nfeels quite so true to life.\nOn the first contact,\nAbandon can come across\nas muted and brittle but\nmusically, Abandon is\nthe fizziest Pains record\nyet: say goodbye to the\nplumes of distortion, and\ninstead, the album greets\nyou with records full of a\ncrisp, effervescent gallop,\nthat splits its time between\ndreamy balladry and\nspotless indie-pop. Days\nof Abandon is the sound\nof a young man in flux,\nwith Berman\u2019s calling it\nhis most personal work\nyet, and you can sense\nthat he has applied his life\nlessons to the music from\nwriting about all the tiny\nvictories & painful heartbreaks that come from\nbeing young & in love.\nBig Thief steal the top spot with \u2018Not\u2019\nI\nrecently discovered\na a new personalized\nplaylist Spotify\ncreates called \u201cOn\nRepeat\u201d. As the name sug-gests, this contains the 30\nsongs you\u2019ve been playing\nmost over the last 30 days.\nWhile this initially\nserved as a slightly unnerving reminder of the\nreams of data I willingly\ngive to big tech, hopefully my current Springsteen\nlove in doesn\u2019t lead to\nsuggested ads for Levis\u2019\npopping up, it also confirmed to me how much\nI love the song \u2018Not\u2019.\n\u2018Not\u2019 is the lead single\nfrom Big Thief\u2019s new album Two Hands, and it\u2019s\nbeen stubbornly at the\ntop of my playlist for the\nlast month. One of the\nband\u2019s staples in live sets,\nthey\u2019ve finally put down a\ndefinitive hard-edged re-cording.\nThe first half of the\ntrack finds lead singer,\nand songwriter, Adrianne\nLenker at her best: brutally poetic, \u201cNot the meat of\nyour thigh/ Nor your spine\ntattoo/ Nor the shimmery\neye\u201d she shudders, perhaps alluding to a pain\nmore spiritual than corpo-real. Lenker\u2019s voice follows a crescendo of rage,\nmoving from a quiver to\nan impassioned howl by\nthe midpoint of the song,\nat which point she unleashes an epic squalling\nguitar solo that perfectly\ncarries the energy of her\nvocal performance to the\nend of the song, an end you\nnever really want to come.\n\u2018Not\u2019 is unlike any other song on Two Hands,\nthe second album released\nby the band this year after UFOF dropped in\nMay. Most of the album\neschews the coarser instrumentation of \u2018Not\u2019 for\na simpler, folkier sound\nwhich acts more as a platform for Lenker\u2019s lyrics.\nThe title track, \u2018Two\nHands\u2019 is a great example of this. Lenker\u2019s voice\nhovers over the track, un-picking the breakdown of\na relationship: \u201cAnd the\nmore that we try/ To figure\nthrough the answers/ to\nrepeat ourselves/ to deny,\ndeny\u201d, while in between\nchorus and verse a wispy,\nelectric squeal accompanies the high pitched guitar arpeggio. All of this\ngives the track a rather\nethereal feel, an impermanence echoing perhaps\nthe fleeting nature of this\nrelationship for Lenker.\nElsewhere in the album Lenker also broaches broader topics, from\nhomelessness and belonging in the earnest \u2018Forgotten Eyes\u2019, to the gun crisis\nin the more plaintive track\n\u2018The Toy\u2019.\nIts these quietly raw\nand empathetic songs\nthat heighten the impact\nof \u2018Not\u2019, and the similarly abrasive \u2018Shoulders\u2019,\ncreating the impression\nthat Big Thief are totally\nin control of where they\nwant to go as a band, what\nthey want to explore and\nhow they want to explore\nit. I expect \u2018Not\u2019 will sit\nat the top of my \u201cOn Repeat\u201d for a while yet...\nMUSIC\nAmbika Bharadwaj\nMusic Writer\nMUSIC\nJosh D\u2019Aeth\nMusic Writer\nArtist: The Pains of Being\nPure at Heart.

Everyone\ncould see it,\nfrom congressmen in\nthe US tearing their hair\nout at Trump\u2019s tweets to\nautocrats licking their\nlips. But no one wanted\nto say anything, because\nthe emperor\u2019s clothes are\nlovely until a child points\nout that he is naked.\nMacron is the allegorical\nchild. He has excitedly\npointed out what everyone could already see but\nchose not to mention and\nis now looking around for\napproval while the adults\nrun for cover.\nNATO was always\nsomethingofapipedream.\nCreated as a way of deterring Soviet aggression, it\nonly worked if everyone\nwas entirely committed\nto the project. In the case\nof an invasion of Western\nEurope, Soviet tanks\nwould be rolling down\nthe Mall before American\ntroops were halfway\nacross the Atlantic.\nHowever, the knowledge\nthat the consequences of\nthis would be an enthusiastic US response was\nalways enough of a de-terrent. Everyone gained\nas a result of this model.\nThe US could shore up\nthe vulnerable states of\nWestern Europe while\nEuropean nations were\nable to outsource their\ndefence to America, in\nthe knowledge that there\nwas nothing they could\ndo when titans like the US\nand the USSR clashed.\nLike a pampered child,\nEurope lost its calluses,\nplacing its faith in the soft\npower of market forces to\ndrive global liberalisation\nand turning its nose up at\nthe crass flag waving of\nthe US.\nThis is best seen\nin the structure of the\nEU, a common market,\ntied together through\neconomic integration\nrather than a political bloc\nwith common interests\nand policies. The EU\ndeveloped in what it\nthought were enlightened\nways, congratulating\nthemselves on the long\nyears of peace and social\nprogressiveness, forgetting the foundations upon\nwhich that peace was built\non. The withdrawal of the\nUS from Europe threatens\nto show up the European\nproject as an ivory tower\nor a fat grub whose log\nhas been rolled away.\nCriticising NATO is\nnothing new for French\npresidents who regularly\ntry to establish French\nhegemony in Europe by\npositioning themselves\nas the rightful leader of\nEurope rather than the\nUS. However, Macron\u2019s\ncomments might just\nhave fired the starting\ngun on the collapse of\nthis delicately balanced\nscenario. Macron doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily see this or\nelse he wouldn\u2019t have\nprovided such a public\ncriticism of NATO. The\nalternative to this, too\nhorrific to imagine, is that\nhe is trying to hasten its\ncollapse. Whatever the\ncase may be, the damage\nis done. Why should\nanyone trust an institution after it is shown to\nhave such major internal\ndivisions that one of its\ntop members publicly\ncriticises it?\nEurope must face up to\nthe reality of a situation\nwhere its integrity is not\nguaranteed by America.\nWhile his comments may\nhave been misjudged,\nMacron is not badly\npositioned as a potential\nleader of Europe. Unlike\nall the leaders of other\nmajor nations of Europe,\nhe is strong domestically,\nhaving consolidated\nsupport after the gilets\njaunes protests, and has\nproved himself to be\nwilling and able to act on\nthe world stage. His recent\nstate visit to China was\nnotable for how strongly\nhe tried to push European\ninterests, taking with\nacceptable in any form.\nSecondly, Macron\u2019s\ncall for Europe to resist\nChina\u2019s economic influence is easier for a\nFrenchman to say than it\nis for many of the other\nnations of Europe. The\n1989 EU arms embargo\non China, imposed after\nthe Tiananmen square\nmassacre, limited the\ninvolvement of major\nFrench defence tech\ncompanies, and the difficult trading conditions\nhave led to a number of\nFrench industrial groups\nceasing or scaling back\ninvolvement with China.\nThis makes French companies much less reliant\non Chinese exports than\nGermany, whose more\nconsumer-goods-based\nindustry has pivoted\nstrongly towards China.\nThe core of his\nmessage though is one\nthat European countries,\ntied up at the moment\nwith internal matters,\nneed to hear: \u201cThe fat\nyears are over\u201d. However,\neven Macron\u2019s proposed\nmilitary coordination\nmechanisms do not go\nfar enough to fill the\ngaps in missile defence,\nair-to-air refuelling and\nlogistical support created\nby a complete American\nmilitary withdrawal. It\nwill take strong leadership\nto bring the recalcitrant\nnations of Europe to heel\nand to formulate a united\ndefence strategy in all\nfields from AI to space.\nWhile Macron might not\nbe the best person for the\njob, he is possibly the\nonly one in the position\nand with the vision to\npersuade Europe to get\nits hands dirty again and\ndo what is necessary to\nprotect our way of life.\nEstonian Prime Minister J\u00fcri Ratas, Emmanuel Macron and Donald Tusk // Flickr\nhim not only a French\nbusiness delegation but\nalso a German minister\nof state and a European\nCommissioner.\nHowever, this is a far\ncry from the joint Franco-Germanic visit that\nwas proposed earlier this\nyear. The problem is that\nwhile Macron\u2019s proposals\nsound good, they are often\nstill in the interests of\nFrance. For example, his\nargument that rapprochement with Russia is necessary terrifies the small\nBaltic nations that are on\nthe front line of Russian\naggression. While Macron\nis keen on a return to\nrealpolitik and the sacrificing of these countries\nto the Russian sphere of\ninfluence in exchange for\ncooperation, this would\nnot affect France but is not\n\n"

However, this\nsignal can be hijacked\nby other nearby plants,\nand so the true cost to the\nsender is giving away its\ncompetitive advantage; by\nsounding the alarm, a plant\nis giving its competitor\na head-start in the fight\nfor survival. \u201cThis open\nThe research team used Goldenrod plants in their study // Wikimedia Commons, Cory\n\u201cScientists have\nso far struggled\nto explain why\nand how this\ncommunication\nsystem has\ndeveloped\u201d\ncommunication is like\n\u2018eavesdropping\u2019 on\nneighbouring plants\u201d,\nKessler says.\nTo explore this further,\nthe team investigated two\nhypotheses to understand\nwhy plants might accept\nthis cost; one of kin\nselection, where plants\nemitted a VOC bouquet\nthat could only be\nunderstood by plants\nof the same genotype\n(with shared DNA),\nand a second of mutual\nbenefit, where plants used\n\u2018open messages\u2019, thereby\nallowing non-genetically-related plants to interpret\nthe signal.\nThe team found that\nthe plants responded\nmore strongly to VOC\nmessages from related\nthan non-related plants \u2013\nthe competitive advantage\nwas preferentially given to\nplants that carry the same\nDNA, supporting the kin\nselection hypothesis. But\nthe answer wasn\u2019t that\nsimple. To examine the\nevolutionary selection\npressures that influence\nVOC emission, the\nteam used two sets of\nplants: those that had\nnever been exposed to\nherbivore attack in the\npast (herbivoire naive),\nand those that had.\nThey found that while\nthe herbivore na\u00efve plants\nkept to private channel\nVOC warnings (ie.\nthose targeted at related\nplants), plants with prior\nherbivore exposure shared\ntheir warning signals\nmore widely on an open\ncommunication channel.\nKessler explains that\nthe presence of herbivore\nselection pressure forced\nthem to \u201cconverge on the\nsame language, [whereas]\nwe showed that if you\nremove one agent of\nselection (herbivores), it\nmakes the other (plant-plant competition) more\nimportant\u201d.\nSo, does this support the\nmutual benefit hypothesis\ninstead? \u201cWhat I would\nsay is we\u2019re reconciling\nextremes of the same\ncontinuum, right?\u201d\nKessler reasons.\nHe explains that, in\nanimals, whether the\ncommunication channel is\nopen or closed is defined\nby the social system. for\ninstance, animals in social\ngroups communicate\nmore openly and share\nthe cost and benefit of\nwarning signals, as they\ndepend on the group for\nsurvival. Solitary animals\nwould not gain any\nbenefit from providing a\ncompetitive advantage to\na competitor that they do\nnot rely on for survival.\nHowever, in plants, the\nfactors affecting the\nchoice of open or closed\ncommunication channels\nare not clear - this research\nprovides valuable insight\ninto this.\nThe team\u2019s next\nresearch plans to define\nthe balance between\nthese two hypotheses\nand the open/closed\nchannels - is there a point\nat which plants switch to\n\u201cThe presence\nof herbivore\nselection\npressure forced\nthe plants to\nconverge on the\nsame language\u201d\nfavouring one over the\nother? Is there a threshold\npopulation number where\nopen communication\nchannels are selected for,\nor a degree of genetic\nsimilarity where private\nchannels are preferred?\nThis discovery\nalso opens up other\nresearch avenues, such\nas use of the plant-plant\ncommunication as a model\nof information sharing,\nand even harnessing the\nVOC communication\nsystem for natural pest\ncontrol. Recently, the\nCornell University team\nhelped develop a push-pull pest control technique\nin Kenyan small-hold\nfarms, manipulating\nVOC messaging to\nalternatively repel (push)\nand attract (pull) pests\naway from crop plants.\nBy clever placement\nof these push and pull\nplants around farmer\u2019s\nfields, the valuable crop\ncan be safeguarded from\npests without needing\npesticides.\nUltimately, this\nstudy advances our\nunderstanding of why\na plant sends warning\nmessages and the factors\naffecting how they\nare sent; the next big\nbreakthrough lies in\ndiscovering how these\nmessages are read and\ninterpreted by receiver\nplants. The biosynthetic\npathways leading to the\nemission of VOCs is well-understood, but exactly\nhow a plant recognises\nthese chemicals \u2013 and is\nable to differentiate to the\nprecision of caterpillar,\nbutterfly, or insect \u2013\nremains unknown.\nThe question we are left\nwith then is how a plant\ndetects a VOC bouquet.\nOr as Kessler puts it: how\nplants smell!\n30\n\n"

In other words,\nprior to this Council, the\nUnion had only one active\npolicy total.\nThe amount of time it\nwould take for Council to\nmanually move through\nand vote whether to\nrefresh or dismiss every\nsingle expired policy\nwould be unproductive \u2013\nand so the proposal was\nthat this task be delegated\nto various subcommittees\nof Council, where a policy\nfalls under their specific\nremit. Of note is the fact\nthatthedecisionsonpolicy\nmade by subcommittees\ndoes not have to then be\napproved by Council \u2013 in\nother words, a smaller\nbody of representatives\nare making decisions on\nUnion policy unless the\npolicy is \u201cradical\u201d. Who\ndecides whether the policy\nneeds to go to Council or\na subcommittee appears\nto be the policy proposer\nthemselves.\nWhile this shifts power\ndownwards from Union\nCouncil to various stake-holders, in some sense\nimproving the democratic\nprocess, it also poses risks\nto democracy by removing the process of a full\ndemocratic vote from all\nCouncil representatives\non each issue.\nAdditionally, many\nthings which were once\ninstigated as policies have\ninstead been moved to\nbeing \u2018actions\u2019 \u2013 in other\nwords, it will no longer\nbe a full Union policy for\na specific person to do a\nspecific thing.\nThe motion was passed\nby the Council.\nProposal for an\nElected Postgraduate\nTrustee\nCurrently, the Board of\nTrustees \u2013 a body which\noversees the whole of the\nUnion and has student,\nsabbatical officer, and external members \u2013 has no\npostgraduate representa-tion, as the elected trustees\nare often undergraduates.\nThe debate opened with\nthe motion that there\nshould be a specific postgraduate representative on\nthe Board.\nThe issue presented by\nsome Council members is\nthat this poses a conflict\nof interest, as Board of\nTrustee members are\ntheoretically meant to\nconsider the benefit of all\nstudents \u2013 not to represent\na specific group (such as\npostgraduates) \u2013 although\nthis is not actually detailed\nin the constitution or bye-laws. Should one member\nhave a specific remit for\npostgraduates, and the\nothers be considering the\nneeds of all students, this\nleaves an imbalance.\nVarious suggestions\nwere offered \u2013 such as\nhaving both an elected\npostgraduate trustee and\nan elected undergraduate\ntrustee, or compensating\nfor overrepresentation of\nelected undergraduates on\nthe Board via the appointed trustees. A suggestion\noffered on the paper\nwas for the postgraduate\ntrustee to be the President\nof the Graduate Students\u2019\nUnion (GSU), which is a\npart-time sabbatical role.\nParticularly spicy were\ncomments offered that if\npostgraduates do not run,\nor postgraduates do not\nvote, for elected positions\nthen it is because they do\nnot care enough about the\nUnion. This was fiercely\nrebutted by postgraduate\nrepresentatives at Council.\nThis then span into\ndiscussion of whether this\nwas a \u201cheavy-handed\u201d\nway of dealing with the\nproblem of postgraduate\ninvolvement, and a symptomatic treatment rather\nthan dealing with the root\nof the problem.\nAs a result, the Council\ndid not approve the\nmotion \u2013 a defeat for the\nUnion President on the\nfirst paper brought to\nCouncil this year.\nElection of Subcommittee Members\nVarious members of\nCouncil nominated themselves for different sub-committees; the resulting\nelected members will be\nvisible online.\nReports\nDue to time pressures,\nmost reports were described simply as \u201cas\ntabled\u201d, and the floor was\nopened for discussion.\nOf note were comments\nmade during the GSU\nreport about postgraduate\nengagement, which is\na matter being looked\ninto throughout this year.\nAdditionally, financial\nmatters were raised \u2013 specifically that ringfenced\nfunding is often useless\nwhen it does not match\nwith the actual strategy\nand direction of the GSU.\nAdditionally, the DPCS\nconfirmed that transport\nstrategies to the Harlington sports grounds are\ncurrently being worked on\nby the Activities team in\nthe Union.\nFinally, a report was\nmade about the proposed\npath on the Queen\u2019s Lawn\n\u2013 which is further discussed within the News\nsection of Felix this week.\nFelix Reports: Second Union Council\nThe second Union Council of the year met on 5th November to discuss policy and hear reports from sabbatical\nofficers and constituent union Presidents\n\u201cFirst, the\nbureaucratic\nmess that is\nthe Unions\npolicy\nsituation\u201d\nFelix is recruiting!\n\n"

Investment\nbanks are financial institutions that provide two\nmain services; brokerage\nand corporate advisory.\nInvestment banks: A closer look\ncompany during it\u2019s IPO.\nWhat about bringing\ncompanies together? It\nrefers to mergers and\nacquisitions (M&A)\namong companies. An\ninvestment bank would\nprovide advise to companies looking to merge or\nlooking to acquire another\ncompany.\nLastly, structuring\nproducts. For example, if\na company requires a financial product to finance\na specific project. but\ndoesn\u2019t know how to go\nabout pricing and selling\nit, they approach the investment bank to get help\ndesigning this product and\nadvertising it to the retail\nor commercial banking\nmarket.\nBrokerage\nIndividuals familiar\nwith investing and trading\non the stock market will\nbe familiar with this arm\nof the investment bank,\nthe brokerage. The brokerage is responsible for\nmatching the seller to the\nbuyer in the market place ,\nsuch as the London Stock\nExchange. In the market\nplace, there are a list of\nfinancial products or securities being sold, namely\nstocks, bonds, exchange\ntraded funds, options and\nis both a brokerage and\na corporate advisory.\nTherefore, it is important\nfor investment banks\nto separate these two\ndivisions. These two areas\nare often referred to as\nthe \u201cfront office\u201d and the\n\u201cback office\u201d.\nSalaries\nIfworkingonIPOs,analysing companies or any\nof the above mentioned,\ndoes not interest you,\nmaybe salaries would.

This is where\ninvestment banks offer\nloans to large scale\nand/or expensive projects.\nFor example, a recent\nGuardian article, titled\n\u201cTop investment banks\nprovide billions to expand\nfossil fuel industry\u201d,\ndiscussed the increase in\nfunding by investment\nbanks on fossil fuel\nprojects (See Figure 2).\nIn the news: Mental\nhealth in banks\nAn article by Reuters\ntitled \u201cTherapy in the\noffice: banks take mental\nhealth fight in-house\u201d.\noutlines that two thirds\nof employees in financial\nservices experience\nmental illness and also\ndiscuss ways in which\nbanks aim to make the\nwork environments more\nfriendly. This aspect of the\ncareer is worth exploring\nif you are considering\na career in investment\nbanking.\nIn the news: Insider\ntrading\nIt was mentioned\nearlier in the article that\ninvestment banks need\nto maintain the invisible\nwall.

Any\ndissent and failure by\nthese countries to toe the\nline, could easily lead\nto Beijing withdrawing\ntheir investments at a\nmoment\u2019s notice.

Justin\nAudibert\u2019s electrifying\nproduction of Shrew is\na gender-flipped version\nof the original, where,\ninstead of a rich gentleman looking for suitors\nfor his daughters, a rich\ngentlewoman, Baptista,\nstruggles to marry off\nher sons. She insists that\nher sharp-tongued, elder\nson, Katherine be married before the angelic,\nyounger son, Bianco.\nThis restriction is much\nto the dismay of Bianco\u2019s\nnumerous suitors, who\ninstead hatch their own\ncunning plans to court\nhim in secret.\nEvery detail of this\nproduction is impeccably\ndesigned. The male\ncharacters are given long\nflowing locks that they flip\nover their shoulders with\nflirtatious ease as they\ndance gracefully on stage.\nThe women\u2019s gowns are\nvoluminous and richly\ndecorated in comparison\nto the men\u2019s, emphasising\nthat they hold the power.\nMovement is also key\nin demonstrating this.\nThe female actors make\nbold eye contact, initiate\nconversation and take\nthe men\u2019s hands and kiss\nthem in greeting, asserting\ndominance.\nJames Cooney brilliantly portrays the much\nsought-after Bianco with\ncoy elegance. Katherine is\nbrought to life by Joseph\nArkley in a performance\nthat somewhat lacks the\nfeistiness expected of a\nshrew in need of taming.\nBut these are just supporting roles - the stage\nis dominated by women.\nLaura Elsworthy as\nTrania, and Emily Johnstone as Lucentia have\na perfect smart-dumb\nchemistry which will have\nyou laughing from the\nopening scenes. Gremia\nis portrayed by Sophie\nStanton hilariously. She\nglides around stage on a\nhoverboard and is incapable of saying the object\nof her desire\u2019s name,\n\u2018Bianco\u2019, without giving\nher sword a handjob.\nMy one criticism is that\nthe relationship between\nKatherine and Petruchio, the gentlewoman\nin pursuit of wealth\nwho dares to tame the\nshrew, is unexpectedly\nunderwhelming. Despite\nthis being the main\nstoryline of the play, the\ncourtship of his brother\nby the lustful Lucentia\nis much more engaging.\nPetruchio\u2019s bold manner\nand chaotic head of red,\ncurly hair are suggestive\nof Elizabeth I, the second\nfemale monarch and\nfamously thought of as\n\u2018unfeminine\u2019. Her character is often dressed in\nmen\u2019s clothes, a detail I\nfound rather perplexing in\na gender-flipped play.\nAlthough the switch\nof gender roles has faced\ncriticism, I thought it was\nexpertly executed, maintaining a healthy balance\nbetween questioning\ngender roles and comedic\neffect. Seeing a mother\nsearch for the highest\nbidder for her son\u2019s hand\nis more shocking than\nwatching the traditional\npatriarchal version.\nNotably, the matriarchal\ndynamic highlights the\nkey theme of the play:\npower, which is often forgotten amidst the humour.\nAlthough the play\nmaintains much of the\noriginal prose, the staging\nand acting has been\nadapted amusingly for a\nmodern audience, proving\nto be a treat for the eyes. ,\nIt did leave me somewhat\npuzzled but I laughed\nmy arse off. Don\u2019t be put\noff by the fact that it\u2019s\nunconventional or that\nit\u2019s Shakespeare, and\nget yourself over to the\nBarbican to check out this\nfabulous comedy.\nI Love You, You\u2019re Perfect, Now Change\nL\nove is at the\ncentre of all good\ntales. Every story\never told, every\npiece of art, is propelled\nby this strange notion\nof an attractive force\nbetween individuals, a\nforce that can neither be\ndefined nor explained.\nAnd yet that\u2019s what I Love\nYou\u2026 attempts to do by\nshowcasing the almost\ninfinite permutations of\nromantic love in the form\nof minutes-long musical\nsketches.\nThrough the lens of\nhumour and a heavy dose\nof modern-day cynicism,\nthe vignettes range from\nsnapshots of first dates\nto slice-of-life looks at\npost-marriage hell. Given\nthe show\u2019s original run\nstarted in 1996, a lot\nof work has gone into\nmaking this production\nfeel glossy and current.\nThe show was substantially rewritten in 2017\nand now they have gay\ncouples, lesbian couples,\nmentions of Grindr, a\npopular gay dating app,\nand even regional British\naccents. It\u2019s all very\nrelevant. Unfortunately,\nthe source material didn\u2019t\nquite have enough nuance\nor depth to really translate\ninto the intricacies of\nmodern relationships.\nSomething rings false\nin a song about rushing\nthrough the first dates\nsung by a couple who met\non Grindr (as anyone who\nhas used the app can attest,\nthe term \u201cdate\u201d is always\nused rather liberally in\nthe context of Grindr),\nthe lesbian mothers are\nunfortunately reduced\nto parodies of a straight\ncouple (although they\nhave enough awareness to\nwork that in as a joke), and\nthe dating video sketch is\njust oddly anachronistic\ngiven the rest of the show.\nThat\u2019s not to say the\nshow isn\u2019t funny. It\u2019s\njoyful in its ability to\nmake jokes about every\nparty in a relationship\nand every scenario one\ncould imagine. Of the\ncompact four-person\ncast, Laura Johnson\nparticularly stood out to\nme, the blend of a brassy\nvoice and a wonderfully\nmalleable face making her\nparticularly impressive in\nher comedic roles. George\nRae, Dominic Hodson,\nand Naomi Slights are all\naccomplished actors, able\nto sell the illusion of a new\ncast with a simple change\nin costume, accent, or\naffect.\nThe music is where\nI felt the show was the\nweakest. As mentioned\npreviously, updates were\nmade to the original songs\nand the lyrical changes\nnot only helped ensure the\nshow didn\u2019t feel dated, it\nalso brought the musical\na bit closer to home\ngeographically. However,\ngiven the nature of the\nshow and the number of\nscenes we were treated\nto, no melody ever had\na chance to take up residence in your memory. A\nmusical with bad music\nis one thing but a musical\nwith forgettable tunes?\nThat\u2019s a tragedy.\nStill, I recommend this\nshow as a piece of light\nfamily entertainment or\neven, dare I say it, a fun\ndate activity. Even though\nit might not chart the specifics of your relationship,\nmore likely than not, one\nof those sketches will\ndescribe where your relationship is headed.\nThe flamboyant Bianco is wooed by Lucentia /// Ikin Yum (c) RSC\nFELIX\nFRIDAY, 15TH\nNOVEMBER, 2019\n16\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nARTS\nSyon Lee\nArts Editor\nWhere?

Just\nwhen you think\nyou have him\npinned down, he writhes\naway, changes shape or\njust turns to smoke in\nyour hands. His texts, so\nwell trod, in the hands of\nsuccessive centuries of\ndirectors retain the ability\nto shock generation after\ngeneration.\nDramatists and actors\noften cut their teeth on\nShakespeare. Ted Hughes,\none of the 20th century\u2019s\nmost important British\npoets, thought he was so\nimportant that he memorised Old Bill\u2019s complete\nworks while working as a\nlighthouse keeper, and his\nneologisms have entered\ncommon parlance. For\nexample, without Shakespeare we would never\nhave been able to say\n\u201cfashionable eyeball\u201d,\nboth being words that he\nhad coined.\nThis \ufb02exibility of the\ntext is the reason that I\nam so excited by the production of Macbeth being\nput on by DramSoc next\nweek. Directors Matthew\nLast and Maddie Roche\nhave decided to focus\non the horri\ufb01c aspects of\nthe play, highlighting the\ndark and dif\ufb01cult lives\nthat the characters in\nmedieval Scotland led.\nThis is not a play about\nkings and nobles \ufb01ghting\nfor what is right. Theirs\nis a cold, hard and cruel\nworld where brutality,\nmore than anything else,\ngets you ahead of your\ncompetitors. Children are\nkilled out of hand for what\nthey might grow up to be\nand battles are fought in\nthe cold mud, standing on\ntop of the corpses of those\nthat fell before you.\nThe supernatural\nelements of the play,\noften so uncomfortably\nshoehorned into the plot,\nmake sense here. The\nScotland portrayed here is\nused to magic. Everyday\nevents like the weather,\nthe health of livestock or\nfamily members or crop\nyields were the result of\na hundred mysterious\nforces that could be\nbargained with, \ufb02attered,\nand fought. Magic is an\neveryday part of life here\nin this Scotland. The\ndirection that the witches\nthemselves are taken, is\nsure to shock. I will not\nspoil the surprise here but\nI promise that it will not\ndisappoint.\nLastand Roche\u2019s vision\nhas extended to all parts of\nthe production. Audience\nmembers can expect to\nsee paper crowns, threadbare clothes, and huge\nfurniture pieces that split\napart in an instant. They\nnever want to allow you to\nforget that any impression\nof greatness or majesty is\na lie. The wars of Macbeth\nare fought over who gets\nthe right to bully the local\npeasants into coughing\nup what little they own in\ntax. Kings change but life\nin dark ages Scotland is\nalways short and hard.\nCome and see Macbeth\nnext week Wednesday to\nSaturday and I warn you.\nSomething wicked this\nway comes.\nCalum Drysdale\nDramSoc Member\nSomething wicked this way comes // Aneira Symes-Pontin\nARTS\nDouble, double, toil and trouble\n\n"

In fact, \u2018identity\u2019\nhas been a key ongoing\ntheme of the issues that\nwe at the CGCU have\nbeen discussing recently.\nA couple of weeks ago,\nwe received a sponsorship\noffer for funding from\neToro to run an event\naimed at our members on\nhow to get started through\ntheir platform. Although\nit is simple in nature, the\nCGCU committee have\nbeen conflicted about it.\nSponsorship is a hard\ntopic for us in general as\na Constituent Union - it\u2019s\nhelpful for providing\nfunding that allows us to\nrun our own events, but on\nthe other hand, as Salman,\nVP of Clubs and Socs here\nin CGCU, phrased nicely:\n\u201cone sponsor we take is\npotentially one sponsor\ntaken away from a club or\nsociety we represent\u201d. Yet\nin the case of eToro, their\nmain reason for sponsoring is not to offer student\nwork opportunities but\nrather to get more students\nto use their service. This\ndirectly benefits them\nfinancially, so money is\nnot a problem for them.\nThis then led to a\ndiscussion about the\nvalues that we, as the\nengineers\u2019 student union,\nwish to uphold. Do we\nonly consider engineer-ing-based companies,\nor should we encourage\nour students to utilise\ntheir skills elsewhere as\nwell? Does this constitute\npotentially becoming a\n$ellout to opportunities in\nfinance?\nWe also try to be considerate of the Faculty of\nEngineering and City &\nGuilds College Association and their views on\nthe decisions we make for\nour engineering students.\nThey are generous supporters for our events\n(such as Welcome Dinner)\nand help to subsidise\ntickets for students, so\nwe don\u2019t want to be encouraging students to turn\naway from engineering\ncompletely.\nHowever, it can be\nhard to be considerate of\nall the stakeholders we\nare involved with, when\nmany have conflicting\ngoals. We exist in a weird\nsystem, where Constituent Student Unions act as\nthe intermediary between\nICU (which represents the\nentire student body), the\nrelevant Imperial College\nfaculty, and the CSPs that\nwith you, the students,\nand thus there is a need to\nmeet them eye-to-eye to\nunderstand their problems\nwithout disregarding their\nworries and concerns as\nan impartial computer\nprogram might.\nWe ultimately did not\ntake the eToro sponsorship offer for an event this\nterm, but we have been\nfocusing a lot on how we\nmarket ourselves to stay\nrelevant in the lives of\nnormal students, even if\nwe don\u2019t always get the\nchance to directly interact\nwith them as much as we\nwould like. Our job, I feel,\nisn\u2019t to engage students\nwith the biggest events\nweekly, but rather to represent their voices in the\nface of obstacles with the\nplatform we have and, as\nwritten high on the walls\nin our office, \u201cput students\nfirst\u201d.\nOn that note, swing by\nthe office in CAGB350 \u2013\nwe\u2019re happy to talk about\nanything that may be\nbothering you.

The path will\nrun across the diagonal\nof the lawn, based on\nanalysis of timelapse\nphotography showing\nthe most-used path by\npedestrians crossing.\nThe aim of the initiative is to preserve the\ngrass on the lawn, which\noften becomes severely\ndamaged in winter, and to\navoid the lawn becoming\na \u201cmudbath\u201d as the rainy\nseasons approach.\nNeil Alford, Associate\nProvost (Academic Planning), elaborated about\nthe intent behind it: \u201cWe\nwant to avoid churning up\nthe Queen\u2019s Lawn into a\nmudbath, which happens\nevery winter! And at the\nmoment this particular\nidea is in a pre-planning\napplication stage. There\nis no guarantee it goes\nahead \u2013 though personal-ly, I hope it will.\u201d\nThe initiative is part\nof the \u2018South Kensington\nMasterplan\u2019, an architectural vision for the\ncampus published in December 2018 following\nconsultations with 550\nmembers of the community over preceding years.\nThe masterplan also features projects that focus\non opening up space and\nreducing congestion, such\nas creating a new street\nto align the Sherfield\nWalkway, pedestrianising\na portion of Imperial\nCollege Road, and establishing new pathways\nbetween Queen\u2019s Lawn\nand Beit Quad as well\nas between Dalby Court\nand Prince Consort Road.\nA donation towards the\nCollege is paying for\nsome of the projects, with\nthe remit being to \u201cbeautify the area around the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn.\u201d\nNeil says he further discussed the Queen\u2019s Lawn\npath with the Union President and Deputy President\n(Clubs and Societies),\nAbhijay Sood and Thomas\nFernandez-Debets, after\nthey took up office this\nyear. This resulted in the\nmatter being presented\nat the CSPB meeting for\nconsultation on preferences for tiling, and at Union\nCouncil.\nNeil elaborated: \u201cI\nmeet with Abhijay and\nTom once a month, and\nthat seemed a reasonable\nway to get student feedback \u2013 which I\u2019m really\nkeen on getting. I asked happen again, which is a\ngood thing. Last time it\nhappened, the grass just\nvanished. We want to\npreserve that part of the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn, and we\u2019re\nbuilding the path in order\nto preserve it further. It\u2019s\ncertainly not a slippery\nslope, and we\u2019re not\nplanning to put any other\nstructure on the lawn at\nall.\u201d\nThe single area of\nagreement seems to be\nthat a solution for the\nquality of the lawn needs\nto be found, given the\ndamage it has sustained in\npast winters. As Alex put\nit, \u201cthere is an issue with\nthe Queen\u2019s Lawn state\nduring the winter months.\nHonestly it looks like\ns***.\u201d\nnot been consulted. Alex\nAuyang, the President of\nthe RCSU, commented:\n\u201cIf they wanted student\nperspectives, at least\nconsulting the Constituent\nUnions would have been\nhelpful. We function on a\nlower level than they do,\nand I like to imagine that\nwe are more in touch with\nthe desires of the student\nbody.\u201d\nAdditionally, both he\nand multiple CGCU representatives felt that the\nplan was doomed to fail\n\u2013 specifically, that a path\nwould be \u201cugly, not solve\nthe issue, and cut right\nthrough a green space.\u201d\nFatima Khan, CGCU Vice\nPresident, clarified:\n\u201cWhether or not you put\nin a path, people will take\nshortcuts and walk across\nthe grass anyway, it will\nget muddy regardless. It is\nbetter to not put in the path\nas people will take more\nvaried shortcuts across the\ngrass, meaning it will take\nlonger to get muddy in a\nparticular area. There are\nother methods of deterring people from walking\nacross Queen's Lawn. For\nexample, bushes \u2013 which\nironically they removed\nrecently.\u201d\nAlex also suggested\nalternatives: \u201cI think they\nshould consider other\noptions, such as a gravel\npath. This way, the green\nspace of the Queen\u2019s lawn\ncan be preserved and be\nfree from a path of gaudy\ntiles.\u201d\nHowever, Chris Carter,\nthe RSMU President,\nthought the opposite, and\nbelieves that the path\nwill protect the lawn and\n\u201cincrease the amount of\nusable (and pleasant)\ngreen space on campus in\nthe summer.\u201d\nThere have also been\nconcerns raised about\nthe possibility of the\nconstruction of the path\nbeing a \u201cslippery slope\u201d\nto further development\nin the space \u2013 one of the\nfew green spaces in South\nKensington. Neil was\neager to dissuade this\nnotion:\n\u201cDefinitely not! The\npurpose is to prevent\nthe lawn being a real\nmudbath.

    "content": "Sonic the Hedgehog. Wait... is it good now?\nE\narlier this year,\nP a r a m o u n t\nreleased a trailer\nfor the new Sonic\nthe Hedgehog movie.\nOne word describes this:\nterrifying. The render\nof Sonic was closer to a\ndeformed cat than to what\nSonic should look like\nin the games. Boasting\nhuman-like teeth that a\ndentist would be proud\nof (clearly \ufb02ossing) and\nunnervingly realistic eyes\nand hands, this Sonic\npushed the internet to utter\noutrage. People all over\ndifferent social media\nplatforms constantly\ntagged Paramount telling\nthem that it had to be\nchanged. Unlike most big\ncompanies, they actually\nlistened! Jeff Fowler, the\ndirector of the movie said\nsoon after:\n\u201cThe message is loud\nand clear... you aren\u2019t\nhappy with the design &\nyou want changes. It\u2019s\ngoing to happen.\u201d\nIt was great to see this,\nbut after that message we\nwere left in the dark...\nuntil now! The new and\nimproved trailer has\nbeen released and oh my\ngoodness does it look\ngreat! I would argue that\nthis is the best render\nof Sonic we have ever\nrecieved, even in the\ngames! The proportions\nare perfect now with more\ncartoon-like features as\nopposed to the strange,\nanthropomorphised look\nthat was present previ-ously. Further to this,\nthe actual content of the\ntrailer was entertaining. It\nlooked fast paced with a\nfocus on witty comedy and\nthat over-con\ufb01dent Sonic\ncharm we all love. With\nBen Schwartz voice-act-ing Sonic and Jim Carrey\nas Doctor Robotnik, the\n\ufb01lm de\ufb01nitely has the star\npower behind it to create\nsomething special. I won\u2019t\nspoil the plot here, but it\ndoesn\u2019t look like your\ngeneric movie that doesn\u2019t\nbring anything new to the\ntable.\nBacking the trailer, a\nremix of Green Hill Zone\nwas playing that gave me\nthose feeling that only true\nnostalgia can bring you.\nIt is clear that they know\nwhat the fans want and\nI am extremely excited\nto see what the \ufb01nished\nproject looks like.\nNow that we all have\nwhat we want, some\npeople assume that it was\nall a ploy. The new look\nof Sonic, and the movie\nas a whole, is almost too\nperfect. This makes many\nbelieve that Paramount\nhad always been working\non this version of the\nmovie; they purposefully\nmade a trailer that looked\ndisgusting to get more\npeople talking about the\nmovie. Then they would\nget way more sales when\nthey \u2018benevolently\u2019\nwent out of their way to\nrecreate the movie. This\nsort of adds up.\nIf I could give my two\ncents I would not necessarily agree with this.\nAfter the recent success of\na similar movie, Detective\nPikachu, it is clear that\nthere is no need to trick\nyour audience. Create a\ngood product and it will\nsell well. So to everyone\nstill complaining about\nthis, I would say just try to\nbe happy with the movie\nnow that it looks good\nand just enjoy it for what\nit is! I hope you are all as\nexcited for this movie as\nme and I talk to you all\nnext week.\nGAMES\nFreddie Ugo\nGames Editor\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFELIX\nGAMES games.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n27\nISSUE 1734\nPoll: Memes.

    "content": "ISSUE 1734\nFELIX\nMUSIC music.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n25\nFEET OF CLAY (Some More Rap Songs)\nEarlSweatshirtisback,lessthanayearafterhislastrelease,withanEPasfreeformandabstractashislastalbum.\nMusic writer Louie Ghalib weighs in.\nMUSIC\nI\nhave been following\nEarl Sweatshirt\u2019s\ncareer religiously\nsince his 2015 project I Don\u2019t Like Shit, I\nDon\u2019t Go Outside. Sure,\nI knew of him because\nI was a fan of Tyler, The\nCreator and Odd Future,\nand I listened to tracks he\nmade that featured Frank\nOcean and Vince Staples,\nbut I initially became\na fan more for his dark\nproduction than for his\nlyricism (which was an\noversight looking back).\nI was fascinated\nby the musical ideas\nthat Earl presented in\nIDLSIDGO. 2015 was\nthe start of my freshman\nyear of college at the\nUniversity of Washington\nand as it goes, I became\nincreasingly stressed\nthroughout the year.\nListening to IDLSIDGO,\nI was surprised at how\nmuch the lyrics connected\nwith me on a personal\nlevel. Before long I was\na huge Earl Sweatshirt\nfan, eagerly awaiting his\nnext project. The short\nproject Solace released\nlater in 2015 was enough\nto hold me over until\nDecember 2018, when\nSome Rap Songs dropped.\nI treasured that project\nfrom the start, falling in\nlove with the phenomenal\navant-garde post hip-hop\ninstrumentals. It was great\nto hear Earl reconcile\nhimself, particularly on\nmy favourite track on\nthe album, \u2018Azucar\u2019.\nAfter this release, I\nwas not expecting a new\nproject from Earl to come\nany time soon. But then\nhe announced a surprise\nEP called Feet of Clay. I\nknew I had to listen to it as\nsoon as it dropped. That\u2019s\n\u201cEarl brings\nback his\nsignature\nloose flow that\nfeels as though\nit is both in\ntime and out\nof sync\u201d\nwhat I did. I listened once,\nI listened twice, I listened\n10 times and I realised\nhours had passed without\neven feeling it. I was again\nsurprised by the instru-mentals, which were even\nmore free form than Some\nRap Songs, especially on\n\u2018EAST\u2019, a track which\nsamples a classic Arabic\nsong. Earl brings back his\nsignature loose flow that\nfeels like it\u2019s both on time\nrhyme schemes, making\nhis voice a supplementary\ninstrument in and of itself.\nThe EP starts off strong\nwith \u201874\u2019 where Earl talks\nabout how he has been\nliving since SRS whilst\ntaking shots at weak artists\nand record label slaves.\nThe aforementioned\n\u2018EAST\u2019sees him speak on\nhis substance abuse and\nhow society nowadays\nis obsessed with instant\ngratification. He also\nincludes a great metaphor\nabout trying to extract\nlight from his stardom\nbut not being able to as\nhis star status is a result\nof his dark lyrics. We get\nAlchemist production on\n\u2018MTOMB\u2019 and it shows.\nThe beat is a fantastic\nslow jazzy loop with soul\nvocal samples layered\non top. Earl raps about\nhis father\u2019s death on this\ntrack whilst calling back\nthe classic Dizzee Rascal\nalbum Boy in Da Corner.\nEarl continues the theme\nof loss on \u2018OD\u2019, rapping\nabout the loss of his friend\nMac Miller to an overdose.\nOn the next track, \u2018EL\nTORO COMBO MEAL\u2019,\nMAVI delivers a feature\nwith a more focused\nstyle of rapping than Earl\nSweatshirt, which leads\nme to an important point:\nEarl has become so well\nloved as a rapper that a\nfeature on his project at\nthis point lends significant\npopularity. Indeed, MAVI\nhas rightfully gotten more\nrecognition since this EP\ndropped, and the same can\nbe said for Mach-Hommy\nfor his feature on \u20184N\u2019.\nEarl has proclaimed that\nMach is his favourite\nrapper (as opposed to MF\nDOOM who was mentioned previously by Earl)\nand he brings his A-game\non \u20184N\u2019. That track, which\nis the last of the album, and\n\u2018TISK TISK/COOKIES\u2019\nboth have instrumentals\nvery typical of the lo-fi,\nabstract hip-hop subgenre\nthat Earl has pioneered\n(see artists such as MIKE,\nMedhane and Slauson\nMalone, as well as MAVI\nand Mach-Hommy).\nAll in all, I really\nenjoyed this project and\nI am definitely going to\nkeep listening to it for a\nvery long time. I strongly\nrecommend this EPto Earl\nSweatshirt fans. To people\nwho have never tried out\nany of Earl Sweatshirt\u2019s\nmusic, I suggest starting\nwith I Don\u2019t Like Shit, I\nDon\u2019t Go Outside first to\nsee how you like it and if\nyou do, I encourage you\nto listen to the rest of his\ndiscography.\nFEET OF CLAY // Tan Cressida\nEarl\u2019s new EP has come with a music video for\u2018EAST\u2019 // Tan Cressida\nLouie Ghalib\nMusic Writer\nFEET OF CLAY\nArtist: Earl Sweatshirt.\nLabel: Tan Cressida.\nTop Tracks: \u2018EAST\u2019,\n\u2018MTOMB\u2019. For Fans Of:\nMAVI, Mach-Hommy,\nMIKE, Medhane, MAXI,\nSlauson Malone. 15 minutes\nand out of sync. And not\nin a jarring Blueface way,\nEarl\u2019s style of rapping\nfeels indefinitely more\ncalculated - as if he is\ninterpreting the freeform\ninstrumentals in his\n\n"

Vox presented\nitself as the party that\nwould give a voice to\nthese ideas. But the fact\nthat its discourse was\nnormalised and already\nappealed to a small sector\n\u201cEarly media\nprescence\nallowed party\nmembers to\npreach their\nspeech of\nterror, and in\nmany cases\nallowed them\nto fabricate\nfear\u201c\nof society is not all that\nexplains their rise. The\ncatalyst for Vox\u2019s success\nwas media coverage: even\nbefore they had parliamentary representation,\nVox was depicted by the\nmedia as a political force\nto watch. This exposure\nallowed party members\nto preach their speech of\nterror, and in many cases\nallowed them to fabricate\nfear about issues that were\nnot previously regarded\nas worrying. Examples\nof this are their concerns\nfor mass illegal immigration and the cultural\nadaptation capacity of\nlegal immigrants, or their\nsupport of legalising use\nof weapons for household\ndefence. As they were the\nones bringing these topics\ninto political discourse,\nthey were also the only\nones offering solutions to\nthem, convincing citizens\nto vote for them. After\nelections on the 28th\nof April, Vox became a\nparliamentary force with\ntwenty-four seats. With\nthe prospect of a left\ncoalition government, it\nwas believed that those\nelections would be the\npeak of the far right wave\nof these votes are from\nthe centre-right party, Ciudadanos, who lost most\nThese characteristics usually\nclassify Vox as a far right party, but\nare claims of them being fascist rea-sonable? Broadly, the historical evolution of the word fascism suggests\nthat it designates ideologies that\npreach mythical values (ethnicity,\nnationality, family line\u2026) that make\nthose possessing them intrinsically\nsuperior to those who do not. These\nmythical fetishes are then adapted\nto the political system (western\ndemocracy) in order to acquire political power. In this sense it could be\nargued that Vox\u2019s idea of patriotism\nserves this role, making it a fascist\nparty in the modern sense.\nMore importantly, though, Vox\u2019s\nideology is the modern heritage of\nlate Francoism. Francoism, tolerated\nby Europe, survived in many Spanish\nhouseholds and adapted to our\ncurrent democracy, whilst neo-late\nFrancoism also made its way through\nthe years in PP and culminated in the\ncreation of Vox. This explains their\ntraditional values over classic historical fascism. As Vox remains a direct\ndescendant of the nostalgia for\ndictator Franco, a better description\nof Vox than fascism would perhaps\nbe neo-late Francosim.\nIs Vox facist?\nof their political presence\nbecause of their ideological indecisiveness. The\ndifference between these\ntwo parties is considera-ble, but many voters who\nhold anti-PP attitudes,\nbecause of the party\u2019s\ninternal corruption cases,\nno longer saw an alternative in Ciudadanos and\njoined Vox instead. Lastly,\nthe revival of the Catalonian issue just before the\nelections, made many\nvoters who do not want\nto see an independent\nCatalonia turn their head\nto Vox, as they support\nthe strongest measures\nagainst independence.\nIn conclusion, Vox, a\nheritage party of Franco\u2019s\ndictatorship, was formed\nout of the normalisation\nof Francoism and has\nin Spain; but no such\ngovernment was formed,\nand second elections were\nconvoked.\nVox, with newfound\nparliamentary presence\nand a de\ufb01nite seat on the\ndebate table, was gaining\neven more media time\nafterApril. Vox\u2019s speech is\ncharacterised by a direct,\ndown to earth style, which\ngives the public a sense\nof certainty and security\nthat is often valued by the\nSpanish electorate. As a\nmeans to diminish their\nimportance, other parties\nhad attempted to ignore\nthem and avoided directly\nchallenging their views,\nhoping to present an\nattractive false impression\nof their own strength.\nBut in the past\nNovember elections, as\npotential voters realised\nthat Vox had become a\nwell established party in\nparliament with enough\nrepresentation to push\nforward their changes in\npractice, some indecisive\nPP advocates decided\nto join the far right formation this time round.\nThey gained the seats of\n28 more deputies to win a\ntotal of 52.
