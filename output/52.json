    "content": "ELIX\nPROFILE\nJOHNS. HARDING THE FRESHER' S GUIDE:3 arJ Lie x this year, ths profile of John Harding\nappeared as president of R.C.S. This time Fit.; jr of ilo a him as number one man of the 1.3. Union. Bait Us his union\nactivities, John is also well-known as a leading member of\nthe Dramatic Society, amongst whom he is more usually known\nas \" Willy\", after his celebrated performance.\nWilly is a difficult person to analyse, beyond the\nfirst observation that an artistic bent is a greater element\nin his character than is plain force. He keeps in mind many\nfluent ideas and accurate comments on events, but is reluctant to thrust them forward, too quickly, in public.\nOne is therefore surprised at his success in the Union. On\noccasions, these two interests suit s ach other's demands\nwell, but there ax\u00ae times when this is not so, such as his speeches at re captions, which are sometimes more serious\nthan suit the function.\nFreshers will have mat him at receptions, and some\nChemists will have known 'aim as the^demonstrator who put out\ntheir earlier experimental fires; but these appearances,\ntogether with those at Union meetings, do not add up to sho v. the whole Harding. Commonsanse he may have gained from being\ntossed around in war-time evacuation, and experience from,\ntaking Matric. at a Co-ed school. Success in obtaining a Royal Scholarship came after two years in a \u2022 school of boys\nonly, and he came 'to the R.C.S. Chemistry Department in1948 at the age of seventeen, a year earlier than he expected. He\nthus missed his turn as Head Boy at school; here is tha link that has led to his being '.Head Boy' of the 11.2. S., and also\nto his professed interest io industrial administration.\nHe admits that his abrupt change from school to I. C.left hi a with social commitments at home (Ilford)., that,\ntogether with Finals in his second year, left him effectively a Brown-Bagger at I.C. for so long. He eventually passed\nfrom a mild interest in the Rifle Club via a second in the\nSeconds in Finals, to research and the Dramatic Society. He\nhas maintained his interest in singing and sailing, and must\nbo Zare in having1 read all but ons of the books on show in hi a considerable bookshelf.\nThis is Johns fourth port-graduate year, doing\nso a oara h on some extra n ely organic sulphur compounds, with\nthai* unpleasant chemical - and soci al - problems. It is an\nodd truth that for all his Union activities, John manages\nto parcel his time so well that he may most surely be\ncontacted in the laboratory. This is quite a reputation to\nmaintain.\nDuring last year, John has had little difficulty in presiding over the B.C.S. Union meetings. Some say that this is due to the general lack of liveliness in E.G.3. If so,\nJohn will have a new exp-erlen ce in having, to control those .\nwho will never be satisfied with the Unions plans for the\nSifth of November, when the next I.C. Union meeting takes-'\nplace.\nThis is what John Harding, the President of I.C.U.. himself a post grad, has to say to his colleagues!\nImperial College probably differs in many respects\nfrom your previous university or college but I am sure that\nfor the facilities it offers it is second to none.' 'What-ever sporting or social interests you pursued during your\nundergraduate days, you will find them all more than\nadequately catered for at I.C. To those of you from\noverseas the activities of the Union provide the most\ncon vi eni ent way of becoming acquainted vd th the\npeculiarities of the English way of life. Nov/ that the majority of undergraduate fresher s come\nstraight from school there is a shortage of experienced\nmen to take responsible positions in Union affairs. It is to the postgraduates to whom we must look for more\nsupport than, in general, they have given in the past.\nAs a postgraduate myself I am sure that you can all find time for active participation in at least one sphere of\nUnion activities. A frenchman who case aere to study English suddenly disp aired and went back to Fran oe. On\nbeing asked the reason, he pulled out a newspaper cutting wh i oh said s\" OKLA HOM Apronounoed suo o ess.\" FELIX will be published this term on Fridays Oct.16 and 30,November 13 and27, and December 11, Contributions should he addressed to the Editor, sports reports to the Sports Editor,-,advert!semen ts to the Advertising Sec, and coming events to the Coming Events Ed. All material should be-handed In before each Saturday preceding publication, and preferably the Monday before that. To clear off some fog that no doubt still persists in your mind about the Union, the FELIX guidance bureau( Regd. under the Companies Act) has compiled an alphabetical guide. It is in no\nsense complete, but enough to start with. A classified index will appear in a later issue. AYRTON HALL: See \" Queen ies\". BAR, THE UNION: Primarily intended for the consumption of alcohol, it has developed into a great institution. Those pots glittering on\nthe shelves are reserved; maybe you' ll get one\nlater on (see \" Yard\"). Branches operate on special occasions. BARBER'S SHOP: On the top floor. Start looking for it in the morning, so you can get a good haircut in the lunch hour. Open Monday to Friday*,9 to6. CLOAKROOM: This is where you put your cloaks. No daggers are accepted, but harmless things like brown bags may be deposited at the owner's risk. COMMITTEE ROOMS: These are behind the doors at the end of the Old Lounge (q,v \u00bb). Room \"A\" has a historical collection of stamps, posted on the ceiling in the days of King Alfred. DINING HALLS (Upper and Lower):,; These\nprovide food, as you no doubt know by now ( see. also \" Queen ies\"). GYM, THE: This is the place most Often disguised in the Union. It is seen in many garbs as a theatre, concert hall, badminton court, boxing ring; but most often as a dance floor. You' ll find out. LOUNGE, THE OLD: This is where everybody seems to come in the lunch-hour**. Seats are provided, but don't be surprised if you spend more\ntime in it as part of the lunch queue, standing up.-LOUNGE, THE NEW: See \"Snack Bar\". \"QUEENIES\": This is in the Un*rj n building, on the first floor( I think). Easiest way to get there is from the: road. If you are. interested in psychological patterns, let' your friend loose on the top floorinG iii lds, tell him to reach Queen ies in the quickest possible time, and watch his behaviour closely. I almost forgot Queen ies serves food, in surroundings slightly brighter than in the dining halls.( See \" Ayrton Hall\") RADIO, THE: In the Old Lounge, audible( if on) when the Bridge Club is playing bridge. When\nit is conducting postmortems, you' ll be lucky to hear anything in that place. SNACK BAR: In the New Lounge, opposite the books tall. Sandwiches., Good lounge, too.

Several1.3. men nave been playing for the University XV, and 1.1. mist stand a good chance\nof completing a hattrick of U.L. Cup triumphs. GLIDING\nAs usual Imperial College Gliding Club has\nbeen particularly active this summer. The\nvacation commenced with a fortnight's training course for new members on the lines of the Easter co'irs e. Under more propitious weather conditions than prevailed at Easter, this raised all newcomers\nto an advanced stage and two of them went solo. The major event of t ne year was naturally the\nBritish, National Gliding Championships held at\nGreat Huciclow in \"Derbyshire. For this the college entered a Sedvergh two-seater and an Olympia sail plane. In \"Daisy\", the two-seater, the firms of\nMacfie and Thomas, and Macfie and Langston did two\nepic cross country flights of seventy-five miles\napiece, while t ne firm of Kurden and Ne\u00able -nana^ed\ntt j get somewhat over half-way round an altogether impossible 100-kilometre triangular circuit. As\na result of these feats \"Daisy\" was placed fourth in the two-seater class. \"Creamo\", the club\nOlympia, was forced to retire on the last day of\nthe competitions due to an attempt to land through\nsome wires, but nevertheless earned thirteenth place in the single seater class. Plans are now\nafoot to use the insurance money from the fragments\nof \"Creamo\" to purchase a high-performance two-seater sail plane from Germany. In addition to\nmaking two-seater flying more luxurious, it could\nbe employed for advanced instruction into the\nmysteries of soaring.\nA more down-to-earth improvement in the club\nfacilities is the new Vanguard which will shortly replace Mephista as the standard means of transport\nbetween Imperial College and Lasham. The new\nvehicle, covered in plush, will be faster, more\ncomfortable and far cheaper to run.\n\u2022Various individual members of the gliding club passed the latter part of the vacation gliding in France. Frank Irving bravely took his dreaded aircraft, the Kite II, to 3ayn es using a London taxi as towing vehicle. Unfortunately it failed to fulfil the pessimistic predictions of various other members of the gliding world and he\nis back in our midst without a scratch, having\nacquired a variety of instructive French ditty s. CRICKET CiMK EWin\nOn June 30th a party of happy cricketers left in a coach for the annual invasion of Devon. Eight days\nlater they returned, somewhat surprisingly, in the sane\ncoach, after winning four matches, having the best of a draw with Torquay and losing three.\nAll the I.C. players enjoyed some measure of success.\niVy les scored 76 not out in an hour against Brixham, Where\nI.C. won an exciting race against time. I.C. began\nrather slowly against Torquay, with some solid Lancastrian\ncaution from Kitchen (59). However, Kitchener (52 not\nout) and K.7/ea leh it out freely and I.C. declared at\n.161 for8. Torquay started badly and never appeared\nlikely to score the runs, and had scored 101-8 at the\nclose.\nThe closest finish was against the Royal l laval Barracks. I.C. batted first but collapsed. A fine\nrally by Thuraan (39) and Severn (16) took the score to\n14-3, but the Barracks just won, by one wicket.\nI.C. usually fail dismally against their traditional country opponents at i. Tiimple, but this year, under the\ninspiring captaincy of K.7/ea le, scored a great victory\nby 137 (v/ ill mer37, Kitchener 28, Viyles 25) to 82\n(Eammerton 8 for20). No-one succeeded in hitting the\nfamous tree .vfl ii eh flourishes half-way to the boundary.\nEamraerton took 27 wickets on the tour, two more\nthan our previously acknowledged champion, the inimitable\nR.J. Reynolds, who emits strange snorting noises as he\ncareers up to the wicket.\n'The I.C. players doubtless owed much of their success\nto their ability to relax completely in the evenings -this they did with outstanding success. Lany tales have\nbeen told and will be told in the Bar before July comes\nround again and printing them here would rob them 91\" their flavour.\nJuly 7th, Kexfc year's tour is over the period June 30th all cricketers please note.'\nSAILING Following a successful season at the Welsh\nHarp, the sailing club took two of their boats to\nthe coast, where they acquired a goodly selection of trophies. Bill Clayden and Brian Foster received a plaque for completing the Round the Isle of Wight\nRace in134 hours.\nAt the British National Single-handed Championships at Hayling Island, J. Conway Jones and Bill Clayden finished3 rd and 6th respectively, and\nduring Chichester Harbour week Conway Jones colle c ted four trophies and had one second' in seven races. Over 90 Fireflies competed for the Class Championship at Hunstanton. Brian Foster would\nhave won but for the un sporting attitude of 33 helmsmen who remained sober on the eve of the race.\nHowever, Conway Jones awoke with a clear head and with\na good crew, Miss B. Galli ford, he sailed a well timed race to win the Sir Ralph Gore Trophy.\nI.C. co-operated with U.L. in a very enjoyable\nMarine Week at Hay ling Island, where fast and furious plane ry was the order of the day.\nSOCIAL.\nFriday,0 c to ber cl6 th.

In 194-7 it happened that 25th October was chosen\nfor the first of a new institution of Inaugural Lectures,\nplanned to open each College Year. This coincidence led to the naming of that date Commemoration Day, and in1948 the present ceremony was adopted, to start with a College\nProcession to the Creat Hall of the University, in Imperial Institute Road, where a presentation of graduates\nand diplomats was held, followed by an address by a distinguished visitor. In the past our distinguished visitors have included\nThe St. Hon. Herbert Ilorrison; Sir Bruce Vihite;\nSir Andrew HcCance, an eminent graduate of K.S.1.1. and\nDr. Karl V. Compton, Chairman of The Corporation of the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\nCommemoration Day this year is on Thursday, 29th29 th October, when the special visitor is D.V/. Logan 3sq.,3.

For, in his letter of\nresignation, which is printed in the issue under\nreview, Mr. Angus reveals to us all the secrets and sorrows of a PHOENIX Editor's mind. He writes with a clarity, wit and Icnowledgeability which we\ncan only wonder at, and try to imitate. Mr. Angus,\nalias Jonathan Staggers, has been the pillar of\nPHOENIX for some, years, and his. loss will be felt, for a year ago his \"Staggers\" et or le8. ii were more\nwidely read in the college than t nose of his predecessor \u00a5Jells.\nThus I found it very disappointing to read the\nstory \"The Creators\" which Mr. Angus offers us as a close to his career on the PHOENIX Board. But\n\" story\" is not the word. \"The Creators\" is a dialogue between two higher beings, and it is concerned with the construction of the universe in terms very reminiscent of the physics lecture the aire. We cannot fail to recognize the imagination and inr-ge nuit y which Mr. Angus has put into the piece; neither can we fail to be stirred by some of his ex-quis it ely formed phrases. I have never doubted\nthat Mr. Anguss capability of the sustained brill i ance he shows in \"The Creators\", but I would have\npreferred Staggers.\nThe best. of the other fiction contributions,\" A Fortnight in Ll an el ph aes\" is guilty of many of the faults in style enumerated by Mr. Angus in his letter, but is nevertheless worth reading. As\nfew works of fiction are not in some way related to the experiences of their authors, I should very\nmuch like to know what happened to Mr. Du Heaume\non his last visit to Wales.\nOne of the book reviews ( like most of the work\nin this edition the product of Chem. Tech. and the\nScriblerus Club) is very readable, and the book in question, \"The Struggles of Albert Woods\", should\nbe very popular when, in a few weeks time, it appears in the Union Library. Another review of\na technical book, is another example of the great\ngenerosity often shown by PHOENIX reviewers to writers from the outer world. If we are going to\nwrite anything not Intended to be fiction then let it be the truth, and, more important, the whole\ntruth. I was surprised to find in PHOENIX an article entitled \"Communism and Humanitarian Causes\".\nWhile it is not badly written, this article, which\nconsists chiefly of quotations from Douglas (\"I believed\") Hyde, is not a gem of English PrOse.\nIn his Editorial the new Editor, Mr. Taylor, makes\nit clear that he was hard put to it to find cont ri but ions for PHOENIX, but I am certain, from my\nown experiences with FELIX that he could have also found an article of equivalent literary standard\nwritten from the opposite ( i.e. socialist) point of view, to preserve neutrality. I hold no brief for Leftism, but I feel that PHOENIX has dealt it an unconstitutional blow.\nThe rest of this PHOENIX is about average,\nthough the small section dealing with activities contains a heartening and stimulating account of the astonishing successes of the Boat Club last session. The Review of Activities section of\nPHOENIX .las alv;a ys been subject to attack, but\nwho can deny Mr. Angus's remark that, as the year e pass, it remains the only part really worth reading0 And having arrived back at Mr. Angus's remarkable letter, which, for me, makes this the beat\nPHOENIX ever and which ought to be made into mil. paper for the compulsory use of every Editor, I close, exhorting you, if not to buy tine magazine,\nat least to borrow It.

    "content": "FE.iL>]\nThe Editor, Felix. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR\n9th October, 1953.\nDear Sir,I was amazed on coming into the lower dining hall the other morning to be told that nonresidents axe not permitted to have a cooked meal for breakfast, but may partake of cereals and toast; the rule having been in force for a considerable number\nof years. Now the two apparent reasons are 1. Ration books, which the residents have to hand in; and\n2. A feeling on the part of the residents that they\nshould be allowed preferential treatment to the non-residents. With regard to the first virtually the\nonly rationed food is butter, and anyway the catering licence of the dining hall goes entirely on\nmeals served. The books are handed in solely because the members happen to be resident there.\nIn the second case the occupants of the hostel seem to forget what a tremendous privilege it is to\nbe one of the 85 out of 1600 who have managed to\nget into the hostel. They go seeking further privileges, not only to their own advantage, but to\nthe definite disadvantage of the pi tiao ly few\nmembers of I.C. socially minded enough to have\nmeals in the Union.\nThe thought that possibly a student may travel up to London and need a breakfast in town, naturally at the most convenient place, or even live in a room\nnear the college and eat in the refectory seems to\nbe completely lost. To be domesticated in the\ncentre of college activities at a cost very many\ntimes less than that available anywhere else in London, and still ask for more is poor form. I therefore call on the Union to throw out, as they\no an, this and indeed all such, petty restrictions which serve no practical purpose.\nYours faithfully, Michael F. Baty, .\n\u2022\n2C,C and 5.\nDear Sir,I am writing to you on two matters concern\nthe I.C. Hag Committee. The first is the matter\nof an I.C. war-cry.

If any more are available, I would like to have\nthem\nI would like you to bring our existence to\nthe notice of Freshmen. We invite any of them\nwho have any bright ideas in the way of rags to\ncontact me, through the Union rack, as we are\nalways glad of fresh inspiration.

OPAMATfCS\nAt the crack of dawn on the Sth August a bur; s topped\nat the top entrance. i ui d&y members of the I.C. Dram* 3oc started putting all the npp s, flats, fool bones, lights etc. into it. Just in time a police constable cycled up\nand handed, us the firearm license for the gun and rifle which v/e had ( for use in the play not for hara kiri). Our destination was the Civic Playhouse, Old llc ii ham, v/ here vre were to (and did) give 7 per for nance s of\nCaptain Carvalls by Duncan. Both Saturday's and Sunday's performances \"./ere very well attended. During the week,\napparently, the Cheltenham, populace v/ ai\ntheir wealth than their culture.\nJhe acting was up to the usual standard;\nhowever, was very well done. Becaus\nof the stage ( it was formerly part of the baths) a whole\nroof had to be constructed.

Also, at this time of the year, a number\nof second and third year men make the same resolution, for the same reasons. Some of them wake up before they leave\nI.e., an<'. discover what they have been missing. Of the\nothers, presumably many will never know how their youth has\nbeen mis-spent. A good start to a University career has\nnot been made unless social, athletic and intellectual act iv i ties have been properly balanced.\nFor some years I Iiave been begging. and borrowing\ndinner jackets, but a recent incident convinced me of the\nnecessity of having lay own. Being invited to a ball, I made my usual strenuous efforts to borrow clothing, and\nborrowed father's though it was in a condition such as to\ninspire the sub-heading of this column. Arriving at the ball I discovered to . y ho ivor tii st everybody else wore fancy\ndress.

Instead of being just one day to which\nall the Club officials look forward as F4ay, the crowd of\n500 odd fresher s was split up into three groups and invited to tea on the Saturday, Sunday and Monday preceding Black\nTuesday. This provided Club officials with a better\nopportunity to speak to the Freshers.\nOn each day, the Pro-Rector, the President, the\nChairman of the A.C.C. and the S. C.C., and representatives\nof U.T.C. and the Air Squadron made speeches from the\nplatform, after which Freshers went to tea and the Club\nofficials. Repetition of speeches seemed to improve them\nin a way, though the platform party on Monday wore, one\nthought, a look of being resigned to it all or was I seeing things?\nA welcome idea was to have one group composed\nentirely of Post-Graduates, as usually they don't take\nkindly to the line handed out to UndergradT^res her s. On Sunday, though, when the Post-Grads and the ladies\nwere in, there seemed to be far too many people with tags\nand far too few fresher s to persuade.\nThe bar put up in the Old Lounge that evening also\nlacked demand. This in fact appeared to be a fa.se of a well-meant, well-planned idea misfiring due to c/j s uses beyond, so to speak, the Union's control.\nAnother innovation was the afternoon talks given on\nsuccessive days by Profs. Levy, Blackett and Ford. They\nspoke on topics of their own choice and, not giving\nobvious sales-talks, were well appreciated. Evensong\nwas held in Hely Trinity Church on Sunday, this also\nbeing for the first time in the history of Freshers '\".Days.\nAltogether, an enterprising and successful attempt to\nimprove on the old system of cram in gall the Freshers\nunder one roof.\nPeopl\nI.C. as usual Has been vr and c ring far 'and vd.de under\nthe summer sun. liners and geologists do it professionally and almost as an a tter of course.

Hostel in and over the Union last term. This\nJuly, they o et Guildsmen at Silwood. Their taxi apparently ran amok, assumed an anaemic shade of white,\nand jacked itself up in a pile of brides. The wheels\nwent off for a spin on their own. '\n.\n.\n'\nhen last seen the tar ci was seeking sanctuary in Suiiuingdale Church.\nSeeing the state into which the Club had fallen, it was decided that rapid internment was necessary for the\nwell-being of the community. Accordingly it was re-christened the 28j Club and given a solemn burial near\nthe cookhouse. No effort was spared, with a pious Welsh\npreacher officiating and a Guilds choir, grave diggers and\nmourners assisting him. lir.A, respected lecturer of\nthe Guilds, read a Lesson from math amati cal tables.\nEvery summer after exams, 1st year Civil s descend on\nSilwood Park for surveying, and always manage to leave\ntheir mark. Last year they painted a zebra to the local pub and decorated the picture house. Similar plans this year were v/ ell advanced but were postponed after a social call by the Berkshire County Constabulary and subsequent^\ndeparture in their lorry of various road and other signs,\nnevertheless, one bright morning a30ft. black and red\nKinging pole sprouted up, as did a totem x) \u00b0le with mystic\nsigns of the Central American tribe known as Guilds.

Weill So here we are again, including the fresher s, especially the fresher s, for whom\nthis issue is mainly intended( Old hands pleases tO ii reading this column here and now, you have\nhad all this before.). This is, as you should know by now, Imperial College. You have no doubt been softened with teas and plastered with propaganda by the Clubs and Societies. Did you take them very seriously? We hope not; for if you did, you will go in for too many activities and won't have any time left over for your studies. Keep your wits about you, and make a sensible selection there'sa wide choice. If you are really good at something, you\nwill certainly take it up. But try also a thing or two that you never tried before through lack of interest or opportunity or both. Do not hesitate to ask all the questions you want to before you decide;d on' t worry about that subscription figure either you will be given plenty\nof time to pay that. Remember that this is jour Union, and depends\non your support for it a activities. Whatever you\nwish to do, try and do i there and there are precious few things you can't do here. You have\ncome here not merely to get an academic drilling( you will certainly get that) but to get a University education, the full benefits of which can only be gained through active participation in student activities. Make the most of your opportunity.\nThe postgraduate fresher s( and indeed all post grads) are time and time again criticised for their lack of interest in the Union's activities, hut no constructive approach had so far been Bad*.5 fh \u00aby will undoubtedly ll nd the article oa g, interesting and, we to pe, convincing.

Head, they could n't find th\u00ae way round the tennis courts. This young lady didn*t. say at what time she arrived; if it was any time aft ex10.00 we could well imagine the difficulties confronting anyone\nattempting to got to the gym. However, once inside the gym,\nthis visitor from Weatfield thought -the arrangements quite\ngood but did riot enjoy seeing a great mob of I.C. standing\nacross the edge of the floor. She added that she had no\nobjection, to them standing there, once she had been asked\nfor a dance.\nA member of Q.E. C. was the neat to be interviewed. HOT\nmain objection was to fellows spending the eye ning in the\nbar until paa o outs were no longer required to get into the\nHop. When it was pointed out to her that quite a few of\nthese fellows would have come in earlier if they had been\nable to buy tickets, she replied that a he had got in without a ticket and had stayed at Q.E.S. until she thought she\nwould be able to get in. It was n't not being able to get a ticket that kept her away - she did n't think the manners\nof the n rn wore good enough to spend a shilling on a ticket The use of vo o al records was criticised by one of the\nyoung ladies from The Central School of Speech and Drama,\nwhich was to be expected. She said that a vocalist, should\nbe trying to put feeling into the words, and if this was\ndone, the rhythm would be affected. FELIX was n' tawa jr* of\nmu oh foe ling, in any of ths records, but the rhythm still left much to be desired. One of the -worst features of the\nHop, was the nerve-racking process of having to tra vera e the length of the lounge in order to get to the la di. es\ncloakroom, while all the male inhabitants of the lounge\neyed them up and down. She did n't appreciate that most of us like to know what will be available during the evening.\nOUT severest critic was from Bedford Callage. She\na oe used the crowd,at the back of the gj m, of moral oo wa js** ice in not asking the girls for a dance. It is a debatable\npoint that this' moral cowardice' might be justified.
