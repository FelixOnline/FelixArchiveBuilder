Both G Griffiths and W Downing will hopefully be\nrepresenting Great Britain in the\nlightweight World Championships later this year. Thanks to\nthe ever comical WG Mason and\nJohn 'Bum Doon' McArthur.\nGOLF\nOn the\nGreen\n\u2022\nOn Wednesday 8 May Imperial\nCollege Golfing Society held\ntheir annual club championships\nat Sudbury Golf Club.\nIn the first 18 after much\ndrama Dave Jakubovic returned\na well deserved net 69 to take a narrow lead over the rest of the\nfield at the half-way stage.\nHowever he could not maintain\nthis form and Dave Lang who\nhad shot a net 71 in the morning\nproceeded to follow this with a net 69 for a total of 140, to be\ndeclared club champion. The\nbest round of the afternoon\nhowever was the shot by the\nretiring club captain Phil HughesNarborough who shot a net 67.\nAnother notable achievement in\nthe afternoon was the net 70 shot\nby the incoming captain Chris\nHarrison.\nOther excitement during the\nday included S Nakamura's shot\nalong the road at the first, M McBride's12 at the first and Bill\nPassmore's double-triple bogey\nat the par 3 ninth. Phil's and Jeff's 'fun' activities in the undergrowth are also worthy of note.\nFinally to all club members the\ntour to Scotland will probably\ntake place in the first week of\nSeptember. Notification of dates\nand location for this will be given\nin the next three weeks.\nCRICKET\nIC win\nthe day\nWednesday 22 June: news has\njust reached us that Mr Peter\nMay, Chairman of the England\nSelectors, has been in contact\nwith the Sunday XI Captain,\nGraham, after his performance\nin the Sunday's match against\nImperial Software Technology.\n'I hope he'll take up our offer,\nnot for the money,' said May,\n'but for England'. The offer in\nquestion is a payment of \u00a350 and\na set of autographs of the entire\n1984 Glamorgan Cricket team,\nin return for Graham agreeing to\nnever play cricket again. 'How\ncan we encourage good, new\nprospects, when this sort of\nexample is being set by\nCaptains? He bowled consistently short on a slow pitch,\nwhich at this pace meant the ball\nramming through at waist level,\ninstead of knee level. It's a wonder he gave away only 12 off\nhis first over', May commented.\nThe match itself was marked\nby four exceptional performances. By far the most\nsignificant was made by Wendy,\nwho provided a lunch/tea which\nhasn't been equalled since the\nMCC last played Hambledon.\nOur sincerest thanks go to\neveryone who helped prepare\nthe spread, which helped provide\na spirit that was ideal for a friendly cricket match.\nOn an overcast day, the IST\ncaptain elected to field first. This\nwas agreed by both captains\nbecause their wasn'ta coin\navailable to toss. IC made a sound start with Wright, making\nhis UK debut, managing to\novercome the base-ball stance.\nThe innings was due to last 20\novers, and when Barnet fell in the\nsecond over for nine, Rickard\ntook over the assault with a rapid\n40. Rijneck (19), Bradley (25) and\nLauder made contributions, with\nBradley being LBW off a ball\npitching outside leg stump and\ngoing over the wicket. This\nbrought in Miss Brown, who\nwould have taken the attack\napart had that not been the end\nof the innings, with thw score at\n118-5.\nAfter tea, IST made a spectacularly sound start, with\nthe first wicket falling in the\nseventh over, at 87. By this time\nGreener had scored 36, and\nDixon went in to make 48 out of\n107 in the 20 overs.\nAfter more tea, the second\ninnings of ten overs commenced,\nwith the batting order reversed.\nIndeed, it was left to the umpire\nto tell the captain, who was\nopening the batting, which way\nround to stand. But fortunately\nhe was soon out for a season's best score of two. This brought\nin Jeynes, who in eight overs\nsmashed 44 runs before retiring\nfor yet more tea and letting Katy\nhave another bat. The final over\nof the day was bowled in\ntraditional manner by the wicket\nkeeper wearing pads, while\nbatsmen and replacement\nkeeper wore none!\nThroughout the day, the\nfielding had been of the highest\nstandard. Two IC men received\nan injury, but the Americans and\nCanadians on both teams saved\nmany runs, even if they weren't totally sure what was happening.\nFinally, as everyone retired to\ntea, with the clouds handing\nominously overhead, the IC\ncaptain announced that the\nSunday XI will be playing on\nSaturday next weekend, at\nHarlington against Silwood Park.\nCome on Mr May, up that offer,\nPlease.\nScores: IC 118-5; and 71-2, IST\n107-3 and 57-7. IC won by 25\nruns.\nFELIX\nMotor Rally\nJames Hunt\nJack Brabham\nFangio\nJackie Icyx\nStirling Moss\nAlan Jones\nMario Andretti\n...a few of the top drivers never to have won\nThe FELIX Rally.\nYour chance to add your name to\nthis prestigious list comes on\nSunday 23 June.\nAn entry invitation is waiting for you\nin the FELIX Office, Beit Arch\nFELIX Friday 24 May 1985 11\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 T IT ERS: Letters\nSex\nDear Sir,\nSpeakng as a woman at IC, I can't say I found the 'Armchair Perverts' article in the\n10.5.85 edition of FELIX particularly\ninsulting or offensive. It was obvious that the\nwriter did not take himself too seriously and\nthe vitriolic reaction to his feature seemed\nunjustified to me. In any case it provoked\ncontroversy, a quality which has been lacking\nin recent previous editions of this paper. Oh,\nand incidentally, I know the author and by\nimplication I know the 'type of person who\nwrites such an article' and he isn't that much\ndifferent from the rest of us.\nYours sincerely,\nM Ibbotson\nChem 2\nDear Sir,\nI write in reply to the ill-considered letter\npublished under the heading 'Revolting\nDrivel' in last week's FELIX. It strikes me\nthat those who write such missives enlighten\nthe FELIX-reading public only to their own\nnarrow-mindedness.\nThe article to which these letters refer,\n'Armchair Perverts', was a well-written,\nhighly entertaining and (as Messrs Gray,\nYeung etc failed to notice) tongue-in-cheek\npiece of journalism. Their whitehouse\u2014like\ncriticism of (and I quote) 'this kind of thing'\nserves to demonstrate their illogical belief\nthat we should be protected from whatever\nthey consider immoral. I really think it would\ncome as a surprise to such people that, in the\nworld of grown-ups, we have a right to make\nour own minds up about such things.\nThe second, rather clich e ridden, attack on\nthe piece mentions 'public ex h ibt ions' like\nthis discourage 'better students' from coming\nto Imperial. Displaying the same quality of\ninane self-assurance that provoked him to\nwrite in the first place, this author now\nassures a correlation between moral\nstandards and academic prowess! I would\nadvise him that this is not the case.\nThe start of the letter, which gives the\nsection its heading, is hard indeed to reply to\nas it doesn't make any point at all. However,\ncalling its author mindless, without f uther explanation, rebuts it adequately whilst\nretaining the style of the original.\nYours faithfully,\nAS Thomis\nElec Eng 2\nBeer\nDear Sir,\nI write to you with great concern regarding\nthe serving of beer in half litre skiffs yesterday\n(Thursday 16 May). For those who still find\nSI units a bit confusing, one-half litre =\n0.8798769 pints (as far as my humble\ncalculator will allow) but those being served\nwere being charged for a full pint.\nI for one would not mind being served\nmetric measures if metric charges are to be\ncharged, eg. 60p per half litre for a68p pint of\nbeer, but to leave some of 'my' beer behind\nthe Union Bar to be resold to someone else\nseems unfair to say the least.\nI am also concerned by the current fashion\nof leaving a half-inch head on a pint of\nGuinness, as this particular half-inch\ncontains two fluid ounces in a straight glass\nand represents a de cim a tien of the beer.\nI look forward to a reply from someone on\nthe committee for the pricing of the beer in\nthe IC bars, if in fact such a committee exists.\nYours sincerely\nEd Ashford\nAero 2\nMoney\nDear Sir,\nRumour has it that, due to the oversight of\nDave Parry, the Union will risk the very\nexistence of 'high spending' \u00bbclubs in the\nmisguided belief that College will rescue\nthem.\nCollege knows full well that the number of\napplicants is a function of the academic\nstanding of this College not the prestige of the\nunion clubs and societies. It will not spend its\nprecious resources on abandoned clubs.\nOnly when students get to College are they\ndelighted with the range of clubs. It is a matter of Union, not College, prestige that\nthese clubs are maintained. Without them\nwhat would make ICU better than any other?\nAll unions have cheap beer and unshaven\nhacks but few have progressed beyond the\n'banda' copier, still less have an established\nradio station and fewer still have television.\nApart from the undeniable quality of its\ngraduates, this College's media is of more\nrenown than any other facet of its activity.\nHas this fact eluded Dave Parry in his\nimmature delusion of self-deity? Let us\nremember that this financial problem is only\na cut in a widely optimistic increase and as\nsuch the resp on sib lit y lies square on Dave\nParry.\nThe obvious solution is to keep everyone at\nlast year's budget and distribute the available\nincrease impartially according to need.\nYours pragmatically\nRichard Copnall\nThe\naxe-man\ncometh\nThe Green Papers on higher education does\nlittle more than to confirm worst fears. Level\nfunding is out, retrenchment as student\nnumbers decrease is the name of the game,\nand the equivalent of the University of\nSouthampton will close annually for the next\nthree years.\nThere are a few clues, though, as to\nGovernment thinking on higher education\n(in as much, as the term 'thinking' can be\napplied to the Government). There is a radical departure from the Robbins\nprinciple\u2014that courses in higher education\nshould be available for all those who are\nqualified to pursue them. The Government\nhave re-formulated this by saying that\ncourses should be available to those who can\n'benefit' from them and, what is more, that\nthe benefit has to be suffice nt to justify the\ncost.\nWhat Sir Keith means is that the benefit to\nthe economy must justify the cost, in his\nopinion. And his perception of what is of\nbenefit is based on wholly unjustified\nassumptions.\nHe seems to look no f uther than the end of\nhis admittedly prominent nose. He has\nidentified a demographic trend and a technological need that apply to the 1990s. And he uses this to justify a wholesale reorganisation of higher education which will\ncontinue to be felt long after the demographic\ntrend has been reversed and the technological\nneed has changed.\nAcknowledgements: Many thanks to Chris,\nGrenville, Nigel, Hugh, John, Pete, Debbie,\nAlan, Judith, Sarah and all the colla tors, Rosemary, and 'get well soon' to Tony who\nhas had a motor accident.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of Imperial\nCollege Union Publications Board and is printed b v the Union Print\nUnit.

It is concerned at the extra costs of four year courses, as\nwell. In some cases, it says, the courses provide training that should\nproperly be provided by employers. It expects the UGC to control the\nshift towards larger courses.\nThe green paper criticizes academic tenure which has elsewhere\nbeen described as a 'meal ticket for life,' and it is proposed to\nintroduce legislation to ensure that all universities have the power to\nterminate academic appointments on grounds of redundancy or\nfinancial exigency.\nAs for teaching standards it is said that 'few academics would not\nbenefit from a programme of systematic development of their\nteaching skills.'\nThe Government Expenditure Plans will require 'continuing gains\nin efficiency across higher education.' This implies a further tightening\nin Staff-Student Ratios.\nFurther private financing of higher education is encouraged.\nThe Government proposes to give highest priority to the provision\nof capt i al equipment, particularly 'new technology'. It is stressed,\nhowever, that there will be scope for no more than 'marginal impact'\non the size of overall capital stock.\nThe green paper fails to give any concrete indication as to long-term\nfinancial policy. It says, in general, what factors will be involved:\ndemand for higher education, the country's need for qualified\nmanpower, the need to stimulate continuing education, the need to\nprovide for research, the scope for increased efficiency, and the likely\nlevel of 'student support', ie the extent to which students might\nprogressively begin to pay their way through higher education.\nPassword leak\nTHE COLLEGE Computer Centre password file was illicitly accessed\nby a student last week.\nThe student recorded an encrypted version of the file on his own\ndisks and then used a de cypher ing key to obtain passwords from job\nnumbers.\nThe leak has now been blocked, but users should check their files,\nand change their password if necessary.\nIt seems that no malicious damage was done to any files.\nSMALL ADS;\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022Elec Eng Department end of year\nparty on Wednesday 12 June, 8.00pm to 12.00pm in the Holland Club.

    "content": "EOPINIOR\nTransport\nand tour\nsubsidies\nThe Recreational Clubs Committee\n(RCC) has, for many years, given a subsidy\nto clubs and societies wishing to participate\nin their chosen sport or activity. This subsidy\nhas included a certain percentage of\ntransport costs. At the last UFC meeting a large part of this subsidy was removed in an\neffort to save money. I would like to explain\nwhat this means to some of the clubs in RCC.\nThe transport subsidy is divided into two\ncategories. One for subsidy of weekend\ntrips, at any time of year, set at 40% of\ntransport costs. And one for subsidy of\nextended 'out of term' activity, set at 30%.\nThis latter category is known as a tour grant,\nand it is this that has been cut. (The 'term\ntime' referred to is for undergraduates. For\npost-graduates there are four terms each\nthree months long, so all activity is during\ntheir term time.) As a member of Imperial\nCollege Caving Club I shall ex la in what effect\nthis has on caving at IC. The effects are\nsimilar for Mountaineering, Canoeing, S&G, YHA, Underwater and a few others including\nWargames and Hamsoc etc who\noccasionally go on tour.\nTours constitute a major part of the\nactivity of IC caving. We usually go on three\ntours a year. A week in Yorkshire at\nChristmas and Easter, and three weeks in\nFrance during the Summer. The tours are a much more efficient way of going caving than\nweekends. A tour to Yorkshire costs only a fraction more in transport than a weekend,\nas the actual distances driven differ only by\nabout 30%, for a three fold increase in caving\nactivity. The Christmas and Easter tours\nenable us to run courses at the Whernside\nCave and Fell Centre to ensure that new\npeople in the club receive proper training and\nbecome familiar with the techniques and\nproblems of caving. Caving during the week\nalso enables us to obtain permits for caves\nwhich are very over subscribed at weekends.\nThe tour during the Summer is the\nculmination of the year. It gives people a taste of caving abroad, in caves which are\nvery different and often much more\ndemanding than British caves. It is the\ncompletion of the introduction to caving\nwhich the club is providing. This Summer we\nare tackling the Gouffre Berger, the world's fifth deepest cave. The lack of a tour grant\nwould make this type of activity that much\nmore expensive, especially as tours occur at\nthe end of term when people are short of\nmoney. The RCC clubs represent the\nCollege just as well as the more public sports\nof Football, Cricket, Rugby etc, but this\nseems to go unrecognised in many circles.\nRCC has clubs which are well known and\nrespected in their particular activity.\nTherefore the tour grant cut will mean the\nloss of much club activity. The tour grant\nrepresents 37% of Caving Club income from\nthe Union, but it means the loss of more than\n50% of our caving activity, the loss of training\ncourses and greatly reduced standards of\ncaving both in terms of difficulty and safety.\nApart from affecting RCC outdoor and\nsome indoor clubs (and many ACC clubs), it\nwill also damage the transport system.\nThe union is paid more for van hire and\nmileage than is paid out in subsidy by RCC,\nabout 1.5p/ km more for weekends and\n3p/ km more for tours. The cutting of tours\nwill make the transport system less self\nfinancing than at present, as it is at its most\nefficient when the clubs are on tour, the\ntransport system receiving more money for\ntours than weekend activity from clubs like\nCaving. Caving does about 50% of its mileage\non tour, this represents about 8000km. Therefore some of the money saved by\ncutting tours will have to be used to support\nthe transport system. Reducing the number\nof vans would be a possibility but this would\ncreate term time problems.\nThe RCC clubs are recognising that cuts\nwill have to be made, but it is felt that making\nmassive cuts on a few clubs is a grossly unfair\nway of doing things, also , being told where to\ncut by someone who knows very little of our\nactivities is grossly inefficient. Surely we\nknow best where to cut money from our\ngrant to do the least damage. I personally\nwould like to see a unified transport policy for\nall activities, either weekend or tour, to apply\nto everyone getting a union transport\nsubsidy. The RCC clubs must raise 20% of\ntheir subsidy from membership\nsubscriptions. If this could also be made\nuniversal then the present financial crisis\nwould be much reduced. I hope that the\npresent financial troubles can be overcome\nby rational means and not by random and\ndevastating cuts on certain clubs.\nSreL>e Lane\nPresident IC Caving Club\nIC Union Transport Officer\n6 Friday 24 May 1985\n\n"

    "content": "OPINION!]\nsingle\nbeing\nAnother quick change , and John now has long hair,\nunwashed for the last six weeks but still nowhere near as\nfilthy as his jeans, which are fully three inches too short. It's so hard to get a good pair of flares these days. As far as John\nis concerned, Woodstock didn't end in '76, man: they all fell\ninto a time warp and ended up in the Royal College of\nScience. Far out.\nI expect you're fed up with John now. Well, call him Charlie\ninstead, dress him in pointy shoes and a funny haircut.\nCharlie hates CCUs, loathes Imperial College, and despises\nJohn in any shape or form. He is a trendy poof ter. Not that\nhe's particularly trendy or necessarily gay, it's just the\ngeneral term used to describe Charlie and his kind by the\nmassed Johns in College, trendy and poof ter being the two\nmost heinous insults that their stunted minds can dream up.\nBut Charlie hardly even notices. He's in love. With himself.\nYou may notice that I haven't mentioned girls yet. Wei, I have now. The interesting thing about the girls in College is\nthat, contrary to popular belief, there are actually quite a lot\nof them here. It's just that in most cases, it's impossible to\ntell the difference. Be warned, lads; that big, sound-looking\nblok e you've just been talking to could in fact be, yes, horror\nof horrors, a girl. And mind your step, too\u2014get into a fight\nwith one of them and you're ago nner for sure.\nIn most cases It's impossible to tell the difference.\nGorgeous, blushing, pouting Samantha-she likes boys. Lots of boys.\nThen again there's the other end of the female spectrum:\neverybody's darling\u2014gorgeous, blushing, pouting\nSamantha, always dressed to the teeth, always on the\nlookout for the latest hunk of meat. Because Samantha\nlikes boys. Lots of boys. And they like her, too. It's her\nwonderful personality, don't you know. Like hell it is\u2014she\ndoesn't even know what the word means. Not that that\nmakes any difference when all she has to do is raise her little\nfinger and five hundred drooling males rush to her aid. By my\nreckoning, these days that's just got to be on a par with a thousand ships. But at least Helen of Troy was a good screw.\nMind you, all this power doesn't come without some\nretaliation\u2014no, we men are made of sterner stuff than that.\nYeah, we men put those women in their place good and\nproper, don't we boys? So the girls, all the way through from\nthe Samanthas to the Janes, have to take refuge in feminist\ngroups and the collected works of Germaine Greer, for you\nsee far from deciding that they hate men after all, all they\nreally want is to have their (beef) cake and eat it as well.\nA fine collection of people indeed, dear reader. But surely,\nyou ask naively, there must be some, even remotely human\npeople somewhere in College? In the Nat West Bank\npossibly? Those bastards? You've got to be kidding. Well\nthen, how about the staff? Those wonderful, wonderful\nlecturers and professors who work so hard to educate us?\nAh yes; the staff. I'm glad you mentioned them...\nSuppose you go to a member of staff with a problem.\nSuppose it's your lucky day; you manage to find him. You ask\npolitely for his help. Usually he won't know. Certainly he\ndoesn't care. And in any case he's got an appointment. Paul\nWeller never spoke a truer word.\nOf course if you're a girl that's quite another thing. A friendly pat on the shoulder. An affectionate grope in the lift.\nA fatherly hand up your skirt. Creeps? The whole place is\nlousy with them.\nSo you see, dear reader; not one single human being in the\nentire place. Except you and me. And as for me, well I'm as\nbig a bastard as anyone. I wouldn't know about you.\nIan Thomas\nMech Eng 2\nFELIX Friday 24 May 1985 5\n\n"

They\nwant to central is e control of higher\neducation so that first they can make sure\nthat all these academics have no political\npower, and second so that they can twist\neducation away from its ideals towards being\na preparation for performing some\npredetermined r61e in the political machine.\nThis is a bit odd for two reasons: first how\ncome they can so freely manipulate what is\nostensibly a public service, and second they\ndepend heavily on education for a steady\nsupply of trained people in order to\nperpetuate this ghastly rat race. Here, there\nare two obvious points to note. ..\nPolitical weight depends largely on the\ncompetitiveness of the economy and its\ntechnological bargaining power, in which\nScience plays a central role. Imperial College\nplays an important r61e in Science. Nobody\nshould go through this College without\nconsidering carefully how and why it is here.\nThe NUS supports the fundamental ideas\nthat general education, to maintain a wide\nFEUX\nrange of informed points of view, is vital in\nour society. As the society evolves and\nbecomes increasingly complicated, this\npolicy becomes increasingly justified. They\n(we?) believe that education is an important\ninvestment and deserves ample funding in all\nrespects.\nThe NUS is currently starting a national\ncampaign designed to augment the role of\nhigher education over the next ten years as\nour country pulls out of the current\neconomic depression. They have various\nmeans of communicating their ideas to\nstudents, so that they can as simulate a better\npicture of the scene in higher education, and\nso that they can collect a wide range of ideas\nfor ways and means.\nImperial College is not a member of the\nNUS. However we are in the University of\nLondon Union (ULU) and the London\nStudents Organisation (LSO) and the NUS\ncommunicates with us via them. Our\nAcademic Affairs Officers play an important\npart here\u2014there are the people who get\ninvited to discussion sessions at ULU and\nattempt to put forward the point of view of all\nthe students they represent.\nThere are four AAOs in ICU: one for each\nCollege Constituent Union (RCS, C&G, Friday 24 May 1985\nRSM) and one big one for the whole of IC. Of\ncourse they are not there merely to\ncommunicate with the NUS. Their primary\nfunctions are College-orientated; they help\nto see that students get a fair deal by keeping\nthemselves well informed and protecting\ntheir interests on various committees,\nnamely\n1 Board of Studies\n2 Education Technology\n3 Admissions Policy\n4 Vacation Training\n5 Careers Advisory Service\n6 Central Libraries\nThat is, basically everything concerning the\nacademic situation of students at IC.\nThey also endeavour to keep everyone\nthey represent up to date by whatever means\nis at their disposal notably Academic Reps\nand FELIX.\nSo you see that your Union performs an\nimportant and useful function. You may\ndismiss it out of hand as a bunch of\nwally brained 'hacks', but this is only a small\nproportion. We must all be aware of its job\nand help it where we can. The basic problem\nis one of communication; but however bad\nyou may think this is, its all you've got\u2014so\nuse it!\n13\n\n"

    "content": "EOPINKDN\nIt may take all sorts to make the world, but here at Imperial\nCollege, that pinnacle of higher education, that bastion of\ntechnology, that epitome of all that's wrong in British\nIndustry, we can find assembled, dear Miss Brodie, what\nsurely must be la crime de la creme. Yes, by virtue of\nrigorous selection methods, arbitrarily based on unreliable\ninformation, and car ful ty chosen at the whim of some\nincompetent Head of Department, we have the\nquintessential Centre of Excellence; the Best of British\nYouth striding boldly forward at the Frontiers of Science.\nJust British? Nay! The World! Well, China and the Middle\nEast, anyway. And what a fine collection of people they are\ntoo...\nCarefully chosen at the whim of some incompetent Head of Department\nPerhaps you remember learning at school that there was\nno such thing as the 'average man', average being a complete fantasy existing only in the minds of deranged\nstatisticians and Labour prime ministers. That may be all\nvery well, but here at Imperial the 'average student' is a gruesome reality\u2014just a few basic guidelines, some minor\nalterations here and there, and you have not just an overall\nimpression but a clear picture of almost every individual in\nCollege. I don't know whether people actually come here\nlike that, but rest assured, once caught in the sausage\nmachine, escape is well-nigh impossible.\nConsider then the average Imperial Student; John, shall\nwe say. John wears jeans and trainers, his proudest\nposse sion is an IC sweatshirt, his idea of style a nondescript\ngreyish jacket (Top Man, I shouldn't wonder). A rather sad\nfigure, John misses his girlfriend-back-home, and goes\nhome to see her every other weekend, whether she actually\nexists or not. Happiness for John and his mates is a night out\non the piss, ecstasy is telling each other all about it for\nweeks afterwards. Whatever you do, never, ever, talk to\nJohn about cars, for John is a staunch Guildsman, buys\nAutocar every week, and keeps an oily reduction valve and\ntwo piston heads under his pillow.\nJohn misses his girlfriend-back-home\nNot a human\nA big hit with the girls...\nNow imagine John in a new set of clothes, buttocks and\nbeer gut squeezed mercilessly into over tight jeans, a rugby\nshirt instead of a sweatshirt, and over his shoulder a hard,\nmasculine, 'action-like' brown leather jacket. A very fine\nyoung man is John; clean-cut, ex-public school, sponsorship\nfrom Daddy's company in South Africa, his wallet a big hit\nwith the girls. Trouble is, John and his mates are now,\nwithout exception, repressed homosexuals. And the thing\nabout a repressed homosexual is that he'll go to any lengths\nto prove he's not. In short, a typical miner.\n...John and his mates are now repressed homosexuals\n4 Friday 24 May 1985 FEUX\n\n"

    "content": "Founded 1949 The Newspaper of Imperial College Union\nUniversities\nwill close\nSOME UNIVERSITIES will close in the next ten years, says the\nGovernment Green Paper 'The Development of Higher\nEducation into the 1990s'. The Government document outlines the short-term policy on\nhigher education. Based on an assessment of student numbers it says\n'it is not improbable that some institutions of higher education will\nneed to be closed or merged.'\nThe intention to 'reform' the student support system is re-affirmed,\nand one likely result would be the introduction of loans instead of\ngrants as we know them. The Government says that 'a greater\nfinancial engagement on the part of students would cause them to take\ngreater care over their choice of study'.\nA fundamental change in the structure of degree courses is also\nproposed. This includes a broadening of the degree course in\nuniversities and at the same time reducing the length of some degrees.\nThe Government believes that a limited experiment, in a small number\nof universities, should be mounted to test the view that 'a two-year\ndegree for the most able could become a prestigious award, which\nwould be highly coveted'.\nThe Government doubts that present sandwich courses provide\nvalue for money. It proposes to consult advisory bodies to offer\ncontinued on back page\nVoluntary unions?\nTHE GREEN PAPER makes\nspecific comments about student\nunions, particularly regarding fair\nrepresentation of opinion, freedom\nof speech and ultra-vire s expenditures.\nIt is maintained that student\nunions have not always been\nrepresentative of the student\nbody as a whole. Policies are\ndetermined and implemented by\na minute proportion of the union\nmembership, says the Government, and the growth of\nsabbatical leave for union\nofficers is also found worrying.\n'Only the president of the\nunion used to be granted leave\nfrom his studies for a year of\noffice, but this privilege is now\noften more widely extended so\nthat too much influence over\nstudent affairs can be exercised\nby a smaller number of students\nenjoying sabbatical leave,' it\nmaintains.\nThe Government is concerned\nthat taxpayers' money should not\nbe used to fund unions that refuse\na platform to speakers whose\nviews are objectionable to some\nstudents although some students\nwish to invite them, that prevent\ninvited speakers from gaming a hearing or that permit violence or\nthe threat of violence to that end.\nThe Government will consult\nas to how student union policies\nand actions can be made properly\nrepresentative; whether, if that\ncannot be achieved, the\nautomatic membership of\nstudents in student unions can be\njustified; and whether the present\nnumbers of sabbatical officers\nare needed in order to manage\nthe legitimate activities of the\nunion.\nIt is made clear that if\nvoluntary agreements cannot be\nachieved on these issues, then\ndirect action will be taken.\n'Nobby' Stiles\ngets UGA\nHUGH STILES, right, was\nawarded a Union General Award\nat Tuesday's IC Union AGM.

    "content": "FROM THE astronomers of antiquity\nthrough to modern day photographers people\nhave been making use of the principles of\nRemote Sensing. With the advantage of\nearth orbiting satellites and other space\nmissions, a whole new dimension has been\nbrought to this area of science.\nRemote Sensing is really the ability to\nperceive and study an object from a distant\nlocation, and it is a technique that is\nproviding important information about\nnatural resources and the environment.\nThe most common way of studying an\nobject is to record the electromagnetic.\nenergy emanating from it, but it is also\npossible to look at seismic waves,\ngravitational force, or sonic waves.\nTechonological developments in recent\nyears have enabled us to sense data beyond\nthe normal range of human perception,\nand useful information can now be gained\nfrom electromagnetic radiation of most\nwavelengths, from gamma-rays and x rays\nthrough to radio waves. There are a number of different carriers available from\nsensors including aeroplanes, helicopters,\nballoons, satellites and others spacecraft.\nOver the last decade or so satellites have\nbeen increasingly used as carriers because\nthey provide a means rapidly to monitor\nlarge areas of the earth's surface. Although\nthe data obtained from satellites is of low\nresolution, it can be complemented with\nother data, for example aerial\nphotography, if necessary. An important\nfeature of Remote Sensing data, especially\nthat from satellites, is that it provides an\neasy and eco nim ical way to study even the\nmost hazardous terrain.\nInterpretation of data plays an major\nrole in Remote Sensing, and becomes\nparticularly complex.when the information\ncollected is transmitted to the ground in\nthe form of digital data. Complex\ncomputer processing is then necessary to\nproduce usable pictures, and the process is\nknown as image processing. Technological\nadvances in data handling and processing -techniques are contributing to the\nincreased value of Remote Sensing.\nUsing Remote Sensing techniques\ninformation can be gained that is valuable\nin a diverse range of research areas, and in\nmany cases it can provide a unique tool.\nResearch activities at the Centre for\nRemote Sensing involve a number of\ndepartments and include studies in Earth\nresources, botany, agriculture, geology,\natmospheric sciences, oceanography and\nplanetary sciences. To support research\nand to help meet industry's needs it is\nimportant that there is continuous\ntechno lg ical advancement. So there is\nextensive research in data handling, optical\nand digital image processing, and pattern\nrecognition.\nEarth orbiting satellites make global\nsurveillance possible and the information\ngained is giving a new insight into the\nEarth's atmosphere oceans and man's effect upon the climate. The Centre\nRemote\nSensing\nTHE CENTRE FOR Remote Sensing was established at Imperial\nCollege in 1983, and has Dr Gary Hunt as Director. It represents\nall the departments that have an interest in Remote Sensing, and\naims to use links between the College, Government, and Industry,\nat both national and international levels, to form a firm foundation\nfor future expansion of the subject. To ensure that the activities\nof the Centre keep in touch with industry, the management and\npolicy are controlled through an inter-departmental Advisory\nCommittee which has representatives from industry as well as\nfrom College.\nOne of the Centre's major achievements has been the setting\nup of an MSc course in Remote Sensing, in conjunction with the\nother colleges of the University of London. It is the first of its kind\nin the United Kingdom, and is designed to fulfil needs at national\nand international levels for well qualified graduates in Remote\nSensing. A measure of the success of the course is the interest it\nis attracting from people working in industry who feel that they\nneed further education about this subject.\nThe Centre is located on the seventh floor of the Huxley\nbuilding, where there is extensive image processing facilities.\nThere is also a large archive of digital images from satellites,\n(including Meteostat, Landsat, Tiros, Goes, and Seasat) other\nspace missions (Voyager and Galileo) and aircraft. This data is\navailable to other institutes of the University of London,\nGovernment, and Industry, as well as staff and students of\nImperial College.\ndirectly receives and processes data from a number of satellite missions including the\nEuropean spacecraft Meteostat, and the\nNOAA polar orbiting spacecraft. Theses\nobservations provide the means for\ninvestigating atmospheric and oceanic\nphenomena, with time sequences being\nused to study the development of synoptic\nsystems which are used as a basis for\nweather forecasts. The Centre provides\nweather forecasts for a number of\ntelevision programmes including the BBC's Breakfast Time, and Thames's News at\nSix, and also for a Brazillian TV Channel.\nThe Centre is also involved in\noceanographic investigations of the sea\nsurface temperature, sea state, and marine\nbiological problems in preparation for the\nEuropean Ers-1 satellite mission which is\ndue to go up in 1987. It will carry a number of microwave instruments\nincluding radar and will be carrying out\nocean observations.\nOne of the most interesting research\nprogrammes at the Centre is looking at\nPlanetary atmospheres beyond the Earth.\nThe Centre has the most extensive archive\nof planetary data outside of the United\nStates, and is also the only place outside of\nthe United States processing data from the\nVoyager mission. Observations from the\nVoyager mission have already given a new\ninsight into atmospheric phenomena on\nJupiter, Saturn, and Titan, and in the\nfuture there will be data on Uranus and\nNeptune. Spectropscopic studies from the\nInternational Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE)\nsatellite are also providing information\nabout the planets. Another interesting\nproject is using data from the Viking\nspacecraft to look at the atmosphere and\ngeology of Mars. Future investigations at\nthe Centre will be making use of\nobservations of Jupiter from the Galileo\nmission, and observations of the planets\nfrom the Earth orbiting Space Telescope.\nInformation gained from Remote\nTop right: A Metostat picture\nof the earth\nRight: The receiving dish on the\nroof of the Physics building\nSensing data has proved to be extremely\nvaluable in the study of geological\nprocesses. In particular, interpretation of\naerial photographs and satellite data can\ngive information about the structure and\nnature of rock formations. The satellite\nimages provide a quick appraisal of the\nregional geology and can be supplemented\nin the key areas by the greater detail of\nimages from planes. A major research\nproject at the Centre uses aerial\nphotographs and data from Landsat for\ngeological mapping in mineral exploration,\nengineering and tectonic hazard\nmonitoring. The major study areas include\nIreland, SW England, the Pyrite Belt of\nPortugal, Spain, Southern Africaand\nMozambique. There are also a number of\nresearch topics under development which\ninclude studies of gold and other minerals,\nengineering geology mapping in Brazil and\nthe asses semen t of the uses of thermal and\nradar imagery for mineral exploration in\nglaciated terrain.\nAnother area where Remote Sensing can\nprovide a unique tool is in the evaluation,\nclassification and mapping of vegetation.\nThere is a long-term research programme\nat the Centre looking at the fundamental\ninteraction between radiation and\nvegetation canopies. Extensive field\nmeasurements are being carried out which\nare providing an understanding of this\ninteraction, and can be used to monitor\nand calibrate the data obtained from\nairborne and Landsat instruments. The\nwork has revealed irregularities in\nvegetation caused by underlying mineral\ndeposits which will be useful in mineral\nexplorations.\nThere is a need for continuous advances\nin software and hardware to support the\nresearch and teaching at the Centre. One\naim is to develop specialised hardware,\nwith a major step forward being the\nCD 03 ^ 33\nH3CD3 OOo3 T to B) \u00b0\n03 XJ WCD \u00a7?:sf\nS ml.03 CO2*3r \u2014\u2022 -j< B3CD03 CD \u00bb =t_. \u2014\n>\n03 03 CD m construction of an image Archiving System\n(IAS) for digital storage of large quantities\nof imaging data. It has the capability of\nstoring 2xl010 bits of data on a single one\nhour video cassette with an error rate of\nonly 1 in 107\n, and is ideal for storage of\nlarge quantities of data as received direct\nfrom s a tell i ties. An important feature of\nthe IAS is that it can be easily used with\nmajor computer systems. One of the most\nimportant software developments has been\nthe modification of the Vicar systems in\nconjunction with the Jet Propulsion\nlaboratory in the United States. The\nCentre also supports an easy to use 'user-friendly' command language which is being\ndev loped in conjunction with Nasa\nestablishments in the United States.\nThe Centre is providing a focal point for\nRemote Sensing activities at Imperial\nCollege, and has allowed the subject to\ndevelop in a way that would have been\ndifficult without central co-ordination.\nResearch groups who find that Remote\nSensing could help them now have\nextensive facilities available. As well as\nshowing how inter-departmental work can\nbe carried out sucess s fully the Centre\nshows that academic institutions can work\ntogether and also work with industry and\ngovernment institutions. This area of\nscience is particularly costly and contracts\nwith industry may help to finance the\nrunning of the Centre.\n8 Friday 24 May 1985\n\n"

    "content": "IN THIS\nALIEN ENVIRONMENT,\nSPACE TECHNOLOGY\nIS OUT OF ITS DEPTH\nInspecting underground gas pipelines for faults may not sound like the\nultimate high-tech challenge. But, in\nfact, the task proved to be beyond the\n'state-of-the-art' technologies previously\navailable\u2014 even in military and aerospace applications.\nPROBLEM:\nDesign a vehicle which can travel\ninside the pipe, carrying equipment\ncapable of identifying any significant\ndefect, and pinpointing its position to\nwithin a metre in a run of up to a hundred\nkilometres or more.\nSOLUTION:\nTHE INTELLIGENT PIG\nThe Intelligent Pig, developed by\nthe gas people, is a vehicle carrying\nhighly advanced sensing, data processing and recording equipment. Driven\nthrough the pipe by the gas pressure\nwithin it, the Pig can be used without\ntaking the pipe out of service.\nWhat is more, it can not only pinpoint any defect on the inside or outside\nof a steel pipe.but even describe its nature.\nHOW?\nUsing strong magnetic fields or\nelastic waves propagated at ultrasonic\nfrequencies, different types of sensors\ncan detect corrosion, cracks, impact\ndamage or distortion ot the pipe. But\nthe real challenge lay in processing the\nhundreds of millions of signals produced\nby the sensors in an average run.\nTHERE WASN'TA COMPUTER\nSMALL ENOUGH AND TOUGH\nENOUGH\nMany of the pipes to be inspected\nare less than 305mm in diameter. To fit\nsufficiently powerful data processing\nequipment into the tiny space available,\nhybrid micro circuits incorporating\ncustom-designed silicon chips had to be\ndeveloped. And since the space restrictions, also limit battery size and therefore\npower, many of these highly advanced\nelectronic components have to operate\nat the very limits of their specifications.\nWhat's more, the environment inside\nthe pipe isn't exactly friendly. All the\nhighly sophisticated equipment carried\nby the Pig has had to be designed to\ntolerate or be protected from extreme\nvibration, mechanical shock, dirt, and\ngas pressure of up to 70 atmospheres.\nA 'TOMORROW'S WORLD'TAPE\nRECORDER\nThe sheer volume of data to be stored\ninspired the development of what is\nprobably the most advanced ultra-mini at uri sed tape recorder currently in\nexistence. Making extensive use of sub-miniature hybrid microelectronics, new\ntypes of recording heads and ultra-precision mechanical engineering, this\nlittle marvel can store up to 500 million\nreadings on a single reel of standard\none-inch tape,with an accuracy of better\nthan one-thousandth of one percent!\nFROM REEL TO REELS\nOnce the Pig has finished its run, the\nnext job is to prepare the data for analysis by powerful, advanced computers\nsuch as the VAX 11/780.There's so much\ninformation in the Pig's tiny recorder\nthat many reels of computer tape are\nneeded to receive it, and many hours of\ncomputer time to analyse it.\nTHE RESULT\nBritain's underground gas transmission network is a multi-billion pound\nasset. And the technical pyrotechnics\nwe've just described have a thoroughly\ndown-to-earth end result\u2014they help the\ngas people to maintain this asset more\nefficiently and cost effectively.\nWHY THE GAS PEOPLE LIVE IN\nTHE FUTURE\nThe fact that gas is Britain's most\npopular domestic fuel\u2014and a powerful\nand growing force in industry, too- is the\nresult of many years'foresight, planning\nand massive investment by British Gas\nscientists and engineers. And they're still\nworking for the future-to meet Britain's energy needs in the next century.\nTHE GAS PEOPLEWORKING FORTOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY\nGas\n\n"
