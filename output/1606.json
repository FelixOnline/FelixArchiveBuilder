    "content": "22 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX\n22.05.2015\nPolitics Editor Joshua Renken\nPolitics\npolitics.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nJoshua Renken discusses the case for\na change in the voting system, and\noutlines the possible alternatives\nIs now the time for\nelectoral reform?\nThe election is over. It was a\ntightly contested campaign but\nin the end, the Tories carried\nthe day.\nThe final tally put the\nConservatives on a slim majority, and\nsent Labour back to the opposition\nbench for another five years.\nThe country has moved further\nto the right, which ironically would\nbring us closer to Europe, and\nMiliband will not take the top spot in\nUK politics.\nThis election saw the rise of three\ninsurgent parties \u2013 the SNP, UKIP\nand the Green Party. The Scottish\nNationalists swept the board in\nScotland, winning 56 out of a possible\n59 seats and 50% of all the votes\nnorth of the border.\nBut is it fair that half the votes\ntranslate to virtually all the\nrepresentatives?\nWhatever your thoughts on\nUKIP, it\u2019s hard to suggest that they\nonly deserve one solitary MP after\nreceiving 3.8 million votes (an eighth\nof all the ballots cast in the UK).\nThe Green Party also has just one\nelected Member of Parliament,\ndespite receiving 1.1 million votes.\nTwo MPs for almost 5 million votes?\nIs that really fair?\nWhen you look at the average\nnumber of votes it took to win each\nMP, you see that the largest parties\ndo well from our current electoral\nsystem.\nThe SNP received on average 26,000\nvotes for each of the seats they won\non 7th\nMay.\nThe Conservatives received 34,000.\nLabour received 40,000 per MP\nelected, and the Liberal Democrats\ncharted up 291,000 votes per MP.\nThe Greens snagged more than\n1,100,000 votes despite only having\none MP and UKIP took a staggering\n3,800,000 votes, just for Douglas\nCarswell.\nClearly, the disparities are massive.\nEver since we found out the results\nin the small hours of 8th\nMay, people\nhave been debating the merits of a\nmore proportional voting system.\nIn fact, electoral reform is one of\nthose rare species of subjects that\nUKIP and the Greens can actually\nagree on.\nNatalie Bennett and Nigel Farage\nboth agree that first-past-the-post\n(FPTP) has had its day and is no\nlonger democratic in this new age of\nmulti-party, more continental style\npolitics.\nHere, I will outline the pros and\ncons of our current system, and look\nat some of the potential alternatives.\nThe current FPTP system\nundoubtedly has its flaws, the chief\namongst them being that it is not\n\u2018perfectly democratic\u2019, in this case\nsince the number of seats a party\nwins in the House of Commons is not\ndirectly proportional to the number\nof people that support them.\nBut in reality no system of\ngovernment can be perfectly\ndemocratic.\nOne of FPTP\u2019s supposed benefits\nis that it is more likely than\nother systems to deliver majority\ngovernments. For a long time this\nstatement was, broadly speaking, true.\nIt meant that parties with far less\nthan 50% of the total vote could form\nstable administrations.\nThis is because the amount of power\nhas is not directly dependent on the\nshare of the vote your party wins, but\nrather by the number of seats where\nyour party can win the most votes.\nFPTP works quite well in a two-party system, and has produced a\ncentury of alternating Labour and\nConservative governments.\nFPTP also allows constituencies\nto have a representative that has\nthat area\u2019s best interests in mind.\nHowever, due to the different\nsocio-economic circumstances in\neach area, many people around the\ncountry find themselves voting in\nvery \u2018safe\u2019 seats, where one party has\na disproportionately large amount of\nsupport in the area compared to the\nrest of the UK.\nHaving safe seats can, and\nsometimes does, lead to poor\nconstituency MPs that take their seat\nfor granted and do not work hard to\nserve their constituents.\nBut as we move to this new multiparty political landscape, people are\nbeginning to question its merits.\nParties with a sizeable chunk of\nthe popular vote but secure far less\nparliamentary representation \u2013 such\nas the Lib Dems, the Greens and\nUKIP \u2013 have a vested interest in\nchanging the electoral system, so that\nthe number of seats each party wins is\nmore closely aligned with the number\nof people voting for them.\nFPTP makes a lot of people feel\nthat their vote is wasted, and many\nfeel that they should vote tactically in\norder to get the lesser of two evils.\nSo, what are the alternatives?\nWell, in the UK we actually had a\nreferendum on electoral reform just\nfour years ago in 2011.\nAs part of the 2010 coalition\nagreement between the Conservatives\nand Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg\nnegotiated for an Alternative Vote\n(AV) referendum.\nIn the AV system, voters can rank\nthe candidates in order of preference\ninstead of only putting an X next to\none candidate.\nBallots are initially distributed\nbased on each elector\u2019s first\npreference. If none of the candidates\nmanages to secure more than half\nof votes cast, the candidate with the\nfewest votes is eliminated.\nBallots assigned to the eliminated\ncandidate are recounted and added to\nthe totals of the remaining candidates\nbased on who is ranked next on each\nballot. This process continues until\none candidate wins by obtaining\nmore than half the votes.\nOne of the benefits of FPTP is its\nsheer simplicity. You can explain it in\none sentence. \u201cThe candidate with the\nmost votes wins the constituency.\u201d\nHowever, the AV system would\nensure that the most agreeable\ncandidate wins, by taking into\naccount which of the candidates a\nvoter would prefer to see representing\nthem after their first choice.\nThe Conservatives and DUP took\nthe official position for a No vote,\nwhile Labour had no official party\nposition. Every other minority party\nwas in favour of the change.\nFPTP benefits the two largest\nparties the most, so there is a large\nincentive for all the other parties to\ncampaign for electoral reform.\nIn the recent election, the\nConservatives won 51% of the seats in\nthe House of Commons, but secured\nonly 37% of the popular vote. Labour\nhave 36% of the UK\u2019s MPs with just\nover 30% of the vote.\nHowever, turnout was low (just\n\u201cTwo MPs\nfor almost\n5 million\nvotes? Is\nthat really\nfair?\u201d\n\u201cHaving\nsafe seats\ncan lead\nto poor\nMPs that\ntake their\nseat for\ngranted.\u201d\nA map showing the second-placed parties in 2\n\n"

Wouldn\u2019t\nit be better to delay the news and not jeopardise such an\nopportunity to promote the College in a large scale?\nIf your goal is to inform the students,then delaying the story\nwouldn\u2019t have mattered as we would be here anyway.And if\nyour goal is to inform the public,well,the story is already out\nthere for them to see.!\u201d\nJasperSMenkus:\n\u201c@First Year Student: Felix\u2019s job isn\u2019t to do PR for the College.\nThere are enough spinners on campus as it is.\u201d\nCecilyJohnson:\n\u201c@First Year Student: You make some valid points,many of\nwhich we\u2019ve discussed in the office.Felix puts a lot of thought\ninto how we present information; we follow best practice\nmedia guidelines set out by Samaritans and other sources\nwhenever we cover sensitive stories.\nFelix bases our choice of front page story on what is most\nnewsworthy that particular week.The Nordin conviction\nstory was the clear choice,and given that we had been in\ncontact with Comms about the story and they had not raised\nany concerns we honestly did not expect them to remove the\npapers from campus.\nWith regards to your concern about jeopardising the\npromotion of College,Felix does not exist to ensure that\nImperial\u2019s reputation is protected.We report the news that\nis most of interest to students; we would not be much of a\nnewspaper if we didn\u2019t do that.\nLast week we distributed more than 200 extra papers than\nnormal,so clearly students were very interested in this story.\nThose students who would not otherwise have picked up\nthe paper were then exposed to 37 other pages of content\nincluding Comment,Science,Film and Arts pages.\nPersonally I feel that Felix\u2019s overall contribution to the\nImperial student experience is a very positive one despite the\nfact that we publish unpleasant stories when they occur,and I\nstand by Philippa\u2019s decision to publish the story when we did\nand to put it on the front cover.\nAmazon soon to deliver to Sherfield\nComputerSuiteHermit:\n\u201cFinally,I can live full-time in College and still get packages\ndelivered.What a time to be alive!\u201d\n\"Green\nassaulted\na Durham\nstudent\nwhen\nbooked\nfor their\nfreshers\nweek\nevent.\"\nThis year\u2019s Summer Ball\nheadliner was announced a\ncouple of weeks ago, via the\nsomewhat protracted method of a\nquiz \u2013 where the first letter of five\nsomewhat transparently James Bond\nthemed questions allowed students to\nspell out the artist\u2019s name.\nHow successful this method of\nengaging with the notoriously\napathetic student body was, I have\nno idea \u2013 I assume buzzwords\nlike \u2018interactive\u2019, \u2018immersion\u2019 and\n\u2018360-degree storyscaping\u2019 were\nused in whatever hell hole of a\ncommittee dreamt up this particular\nmarketing idea, while other words\nlike \u2018maybe just email everyone with\nthe headliner in the subject line so\nthey still find out even though they\u2019ll\ndelete the email along with every\nother email anyone has ever got from\nthe Union\u2019 were brushed under the\ntea, coffee and danishes table.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard from a friend\n(either because you don\u2019t have any or\nbecause you have friends who have\nbetter things to talk about \u2013 like\nthe socioeconomic state of Syria, or\nEurovision or something), or failed to\nsee the rather menacing posters and\nleaflets littered around FiveSixEight,\nthe headliner for this year\u2019s Summer\nBall is the so-called Professor Green.\nThis seems like a great match.\nImperial is a University; Green is\napparently a Professor. Green hasn\u2019t\nbeen popular since 2010; the Union\nhas no money. Imperial has a history\nof ethics issues and inviting hate\nspeakers; Green assaulted a Durham\nstudent when booked for their\nFreshers\u2019 Week event. Wait. What?\nLet me start again. On Friday\n3rd\nOctober, 2014, a man slapped a\nteenager. At the Durham Freshers\nball. Whilst performing on stage.\nWith a security guard present to\nsuppress any response. That man\nhas since been contracted for an\nestimated \u00a310,000 to headline the\nImperial Summer Ball. See the\nproblem here?\nFor some background, you should\nwatch the videos \u2013 a quick Google\nof \u201cProfessor Green slaps\u201d will get\nyou two taken from different angles.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you get if you call me a\nc**t\u201d shouts the triumphant happy\nslapper, before segueing smoothly\ninto the presumably rhetorical \u201cAre\nwe going to have a f***ing good time\ntonight or what?\u201d Not so PG after all.\nWhat is most unnerving about\nthis incident is Professor Green\u2019s\napparent lack of contrition, telling\nthe Mirror: \u201cI don\u2019t reflect on things\nlike that\u201d. He stated, \u201cIf someone\nabuses you and throws their hand\nup at your face, then someone says\nthat you hit a fan I\u2019m just like like\nwhat fan? It happened. I mean, what\u2019s\nhappened to rock and roll? I don\u2019t\nunderstand why it became such a big\nthing.\u201d\nNow whether or not it could be\nclaimed that by hiring Green the\nUnion is implicitly condoning his\nactions, the question must be asked as\nto who on earth thought that this was\na good idea. It should be noted at this\npoint that the Union, insecure in its\nown ability to choose and book a \u2018big\nname\u2019 artist and presumably scared\nof any involvement of students in\nthe Ball\u2019s running since the debacle\nof 2011, when general incompetence\nand unrealistic expectations led to a\nloss of \u00a3120,000 over the course of\none badly attended evening, hired an\nexternal agency to recommend and\nbook the acts.\nThe unfortunate thing is that the\nagency, the Union, and Green\u2019s self\ninflated sense of importance are\nright. Whether or not brand ICU\nwill benefit from being linked to an\nunapologetic thug, Professor Green\u2019s\nname (and to a lesser extent, face)\nattached to the summer ball has seen\na huge spike in ticket sales, increased\non last year, and reports of \u201cwell\nexcited\u201d freshers.\nAnd what if the incident is\nrepeated at Imperial? One Durham\nstudent, \u201cgutted\u201d to have missed the\nfreshers ball, told The Tab Durham\nthat paying almost \u00a340 to attend\nwould have been \u201cworth it to see a\ninternationally renowned rap artist\nbitch slap a teenager\u201d.\nWhether or not the staff involved\nin the decision making process that\nled to booking the so called Professor\nwere aware of the incident leads to\ntwo conclusions. Either they knew\nabout the incident; having spent\nmore than 5 minutes researching\nthe person they were spending half\na year\u2019s salary on in a single evening\nand decided that this was something\nthey were ok with, or they do have a\nmoral compass but, failing to have\ndone the initial research and finding\nout too late, are now unable to back\nout of the contract. While the reader\ncan draw their own conclusions,\npast experience would suggest that\nthe simplest explanation here is\nincompetence.\n\"Who\non earth\nthought\nthat this\nwas a good\nidea?\"\n\n"

The BUAV has been\ngranted a judicial review against the\nHome Office findings, stating that\ntheir sanctions weren\u2019t too severe.\nThey have also seemingly chucked\nin a few allegations against Imperial\ntoo, just in case we start to think\nCollege are off the hook, this time\naccusing College of \u201cmisleading the\npublic\u201d in the care they provide for\nresearch animals post surgery.\nImperial\u2019s track record in animal\ntesting hasn\u2019t been the best, but they\nseem to be getting it right this time\naround. After reading their Annual\nAnimal Research Review, and putting\nthe cooperate branding overkill\naside, the document does seem to\nsuccessfully convey just how much\ntime and effort they really are putting\ninto their reform. They\u2019ve introduced\nnew advisory boards and committees\nto bring together academics from all\ndepartments and hopefully improve\nthe way we use animals in science,\nand are thinking about the future of\nanimal testing to make sure we don\u2019t\nmake the same mistakes again.\nImperial took those BUAV\nallegations seriously; the use of\nanimals in science research is a\nnecessity but should still be treated\nas a privilege instead of a right. The\nuse of living animals to further\nour knowledge, understanding and\ndevelopment of science and medicine\nis a terrible trade off, and if we could\nuse models, tissues and programs to\ndo it for us we would. Technology\nis still developing, but for the time\nbeing, we rely on those little mice,\nfish, ferrets and rabbits to test and\nrefine the drugs that keep us healthy\nand save our lives.\nThere will always be casualties in\nanimal testing, and obviously no life\nis worth more than another, but if we\nare going to ensure that these animals\nare to give up theirs to increase the\nquality of our existence, we need to do\neverything in our power to ensure the\npain is minimal, the suffering is short\nand the value of the findings from\nsuch testing is maximised.\nImperial, despite their flashy\nwebsites, blog posts and news stories,\nseem to have finally got to the root of\nthis ethos, and I have full faith that\nthe judicial review will find Imperial\nis still doing all it can to ensure\nanimals are kept safe and happy.\nGood management and guidance\nwill ensure that these values will\ncontinue to trickle down into the lab\ngroups and beyond, and hopefully the\nreputation of Imperial as a science\ninstitute will slowly recover.\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S EDITORIAL\n\u201cThe use of animals in science\nresearch is a necessity but should\nstill be treated as a privilege\u201d\nContents\nNews\b3-8\nFeatures\b9\nComment 10-11\nFilm 13-15\nTelevision\b16\nFashion\b17\nPolitics\b22-23\nArts\b25-32\nHangman\b33-35\nPuzzles\b36-38\nC and S\t\t 39\nSport 40\nFelix Offices\nBeit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\nTel: 020 7594 8072\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nPrinted by Iliffe Print Cambridge, Winship\nRoad, Cambridge.\nRegistered newspaper ISSN 1040-0711\nCopyright \u00a9 Felix\nFront page picture: John-Paul Jones\nTop banner: Facebook\nThere is still time to get\ninvolved!\nEmail felix @imperial.ac.uk\nWhat\u2019s on this\nweek:\nHot Dog Special\nAll week\nJust when you thought\nthere couldn\u2019t be any more\nsausages in FiveSixEight.\nPrices start from \u00a34.75\nReynolds Cocktail Club\nFriday 22nd May\nReynolds will be transformed\ninto a cocktail lounge with\nrelaxed music and a chilled\natmosphere.\nUnion Awards\nWednesday 27th May\nThe deadline for nominations\nis fast approaching\n\n"

Bath\nSpa expanded their zoo this year to\ninclude Shetland Ponies alongside the\nregular goats, ducks and baby chicks.\nStudents at the University of Exeter\nhave had the opportunity to cuddle\nwith tiny micropigs, provided by\na local farm. At Royal Holloway,\nUniversity of London, the Students\u2019\nUnion provided both a petting zoo\nand regular Puppy Therapy sessions\nwith dogs from Battersea Dogs Home.\nBristol University opened up a\npuppy-petting centre in partnership\nwith the charity UK Guide Dogs. Over\n2000 students applied but just 500 got\nthe chance to take part in the project,\ninspired by recent research in Japan\nwhich suggested that interacting with\nanimals may improve concentration\nlevels and exam performance.\nPerhaps they were suffering from\ncuteness overload at the University of\nReading \u2013 their Students\u2019 Union went\nwith less conventionally adorable\nanimals, organising a reptile zoo.\nHundreds of students turned up to\nmeet and hold the bearded dragons,\nlizards, tortoises and boa constrictors.\nHowever not all Universities have\ngone the animal therapy route. The\nUniversity of Manchester Student\nUnion hosted an entire festival with\nlive music and stalls selling food and\nvintage clothing. The University\nof Huddersfield held a de-stressing\nknitting session, which supported the\ncharity Age UK.\nFitness sessions are also becoming\nmore popular this year, with Durham\nUniversity offering free Thai boxing\nclasses, while students at Leeds\nBeckett University got to enjoy\nskipping and a \u201creiki taster session\u201d,\nand Queen Mary University of\nLondon offered an introduction to\nmeditation.\nThe University of Plymouth\nStudent Union attempted to\ncrowdfund a giant ball pit, capable\nof entertaining 50 students at a\ntime. Sadly it appears that they were\nunsuccessful this year, but maybe\nnext exam season they\u2019ll secure the\nfunding required to purchase the\nnecessary 50,000 plastic balls.\nMeanwhile at Imperial, campus has\nbeen pretty quiet after the excitement\nof \u2018Treat Yo\u2019 Self Week\u2019 last term,\nwhich was hosted by the Royal\nCollege of Science and Royal School\nof Mines Unions with the support\nof Imperial College Union. The\nactivities included an obstacle course,\nfree candy floss, yoga sessions and a\nbouncy castle.\nIn previous years, our Union has\nrun the wide-reaching campaign\n\u2018Stress Less\u2019, billed as \u201ca whole host of\nevents designed to help you de-stress\nduring the exam and coursework\nperiod\u201d. Stress Less events have\nincluded masseurs in the Library\nCaf\u00e9, free yoga lessons, crazy golf,\nbouncy castles and a petting zoo on\nthe Queen\u2019s Lawn.\nUnfortunately in 2013 the\norganisers came under fire from\nanimal rights activists who spammed\nthe College Facebook page with angry\ncomments.

The new addition\nto his already successful womenswear\ncollection will be debuted in June\u2019s\nLondon Collections: Men.\nSo what can you expect from\nthe fashion designer? This fashion\nfollower suspects a runaway from the\ntypical (yet classic) runway look of\nplaid or herringbone two, three, four\nor five piece suits. Instead, dream a bit\nmore of glittering metallic, possibly\nfrom a constellation of colours. We\nmight even get skirts, we might not!\nWho knows what is in store? What\nwe do know is that the collection\nwill surely be a feast for the eyes, a\nsort of messy orgasm that feels so\nundoubtedly good we are slain for at\nleast a couple of days.\nWhilst many may freak about the\nthought of being caught out in one\nof Holland\u2019s more creative pieces, it\nis important to realise that Holland\u2019s\nclothing seeks to empower in a way\nmany other designers fail to do so.\nThe bold and often striking designs\nare not for the faint hearted, but\nthose who wear them will know what\nthe clothing exude. Now men, straight\nor gay, will be able to boost their\npresence with out of the ordinary\nlooks.\nHenry Holland has in the past\nspoken about a menswear line to\naccompany the brands womenswear\nline, which is a star favourite. Miley\nCyrus, Rihanna and Holland\u2019s very\nown muse, Nicola Roberts, are often\nseen wearing clothing from the\ndesigner.\nWe know Holland\u2019s main fashion\nline may not be to everyone\u2019s taste.\nWe all have different styles after all.\nHowever, Holland has already gone\ninto accessories. So if you\u2019re looking\nto up your ante and dress to impress\nwithout going too over the top and\nabandoning who you really are, you\ncould opt for a pair of statement\nsunglasses. You don\u2019t even have to\nwear them on your face. Carrying\nthem like a clutch is the ultimate\nguide for releasing the cool girl inside.\nWhilst we wait, here are some\npictures for the ladies who may still\nneed a bit of inspiration for their\nlooks this coming Autumn/Winter\nseason for 2015/2016 (the fashion\nindustry is always one season ahead!)\nNote his sensible cool factor,\nepitomising the \u201cold school\u201d London\nfashion typique (made up word, but\nthat\u2019s how I roll!), but bringing it to\nthe epicentre of fashion today!\nC\u00e9cile Borkhataria talks us through\nHenry Holland\u2019s new line of menswear\nSamples from House of Holland\u2019s Autumn/Winter Collection.

Each of us in our\nown way was broken. It was hard to know\nwho was more crazy; me, or everyone\nelse.\u201d\nPicture the scene. In the distant\nfuture, water wars have\ndestroyed society, law and\norder has broken down and human\ncivilisation has fallen.\n\u201cMad\u201d Max Rockatansky, played\nby Tom Hardy, is a lone survivor\nin the arid desert wastelands of\nAustralia. Captured by the \u2018War Boys\u2019\n\u2013 led by King Immortan Joe (Hugh\nKeays-Byrne) \u2013 Max is designated a\nuniversal blood donor and used as\na blood bag for the weak War Boy\nNux (Nicholas Hault). Elsewhere,\nImperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron)\ndrives her weaponised War Rig oil\ntanker to collect gasoline \u2013 a resource\nnow far less coveted than water.\nFuriosa veers her War Rig off the\npredetermined route in an attempt\nto escape, alerting King Immortan\nJoe who realises that his five wives \u2013\nspecially selected for breeding \u2013 have\nalso legged it.\nImmortan leads his entire fleet\nof vehicles and War Boys in hot\npursuit of Furiosa and his wives.\nHe\u2019s particularly keen on getting his\nchild \u2013 who he hopes is a son \u2013 out\nof his favourite wife, played by Rosie\nHuntington-Whiteley. The casting\ndecisions suggest that Fury Road is\ngoing to be as terrible as Transformers,\nbut mercifully this is not even\nremotely the case.\nThat is the set-up. I will not unravel\nany more of the plot, which is just\nas well because I don\u2019t think I could\ncontinue if I tried. Essentially Mad\nMax: Fury Road is a prison break\nturned chase action thriller centred\non the cooperation of slaves (of\ndifferent kinds) in a desperate bid\nfor freedom. Or put another way,\nit\u2019s about a cult leader with the\nface of a scrotum searching for his\ndesert bitches in a post-apocalyptic\nwasteland. Take your pick.\nThis film is set in one of the bleakest\ndystopias in film history, inhabited\nby tyrannical Aussie mercenaries,\nAussie slaves, Tom Hardy and King\nImmortan \u2013 a sadistic overlord who\nlooks like the lovechild of Peter\nJackson\u2019s Sauron and Christopher\nNolan\u2019s Bane.\nAlong the way we meet demented\nImmortan-worshipping skinheads\nwith full white body paint, who love\nnothing more than spraying their\nmouths with a silver elixir from an\naerosol can, before dying for their\ncause in front of \u2018witnesses\u2019. This\ninspired act of martyrdom is all done\nwith the expectation of gaining safe\npassage through the gates of Valhalla\nwith Immortan.\n(I don\u2019t know what Immortan\nhas promised them in Valhalla.\nPerhaps flexible working hours in the\nafterlife?)\nIn this two-hour blaze of spears\nand fire, there is close to no character\ndevelopment. I still don\u2019t know for\nsure whether it\u2019s just me, or whether\nthis is what most action films are\nlike, but Fury Road seems to offer no\ninsights to the audience about Max,\nFuriosa or Nux.\nMax experiences unexplained\nvisions of children and the elderly,\nboth living and dead, who all seem\nangry at him. These moments clearly\nhaunt Max, but they are never\nexplored.\nFury Road is one of the first films\nI\u2019ve ever watched with barely any\nmemorable dialogue. The two best\nlines come from Max, both of which\nare uttered in the first five minutes of\nthe film.\nDespite the pretense and\nsuggestions of profundity, Fury\nroad is really quite a dumb film. It\u2019s\njust an excuse for the directors and\ncinematographers to capture big,\nvehicular orgies of oil, explosions,\ndeath and metal in pornographic\ndetail.\nI watched Mad Max in 2D, and\nneeded to lie down for the rest of the\nevening. God knows what it\u2019s like in\n3D. Probably life-altering.\nYou can\u2019t help but be in awe of\nthe imagination of the psychopath/\ncinematographer that managed to put\nit all together. In all the warfare there\nis a crunchy physicality to the sounds\nof the gunshots, explosions and\nengines. I can\u2019t quite explain it, but\nevery action by the lead characters are\nsomehow more visceral than in other\ncomparatively bland action films.\nTom Hardy is excellent as Mad Max,\nplaying the primitive survivor \u2013 who\nseems to communicate exclusively\nin threats \u2013 to a T. His previous roles\nin The Dark Knight Rises, Bronson and\nWarrior all come together in a glorious\nexhibition of acting prowess.\nMany critics have said that the\nreal star of the film is Charlize\nTheron, who plays the Oil Rig driver\nand all round badass Furiosa. Fury\nRoad has even been heralded as a\n\u2018feminist film\u2019 that shines a beacon of\nfemale empowerment against male\noppression. And when you watch it,\nyou can see why.\nFor the first time ever I think I\u2019m\nmore puzzled after watching this film\nthan when I first saw the trailer. This\nmight just be because I desperately\nwant to know just what the hell is\ngoing on, when really this film is best\nenjoyed when the viewer excepts the\nmadness of the plot.\nLogic is kryptonite to a Mad Max\naudience. So if you do watch this film,\nand I sincerely hope that you do, don\u2019t\neven try to follow. You will have lots\nof questions after watching the trailer.\nAlas, the film yields little in the way\nof explanation.\nPerhaps the most amazing thing\nof all about Mad Max: Fury Road,\nhowever, is that the director George\nMiller\u2019s last film before creating this\ntowering cinematic masterpiece was, I\nshit you not, Happy Feet Two.\nI don\u2019t know what possessed \u2013 and\nI use that word carefully \u2013 Miller to\ncreate such a spectacular display of\nnoise and nonsense. Mad Max: Fury\nRoad occupies a world of blood, fire,\nsand and oil.\nIt is a truly mesmerising odyssey\nlikely inspired by a ketamine-induced\ndream sequence that turned into a\nreally, really bad trip. It really is that\nbleak. Memorable, certainly. But\nbleak.\nIf nothing else, Mad Max: Fury\nRoad reminds us that we could be\nliving in a world of naked barbarism,\nrogue armies, sacrificial cults, sandy\nwastelands and scarce resources, when\nin fact we get to live a life of taxes,\nSainsbury\u2019s and Angry Birds. And for\nthat reason, I absolutely love it.\nMax\u2019s Hannibal Lecter impression wasn\u2019t quite going to plan.

It\nwould also make single party majority\ngovernments a thing of the past, as\nwe are very unlikely to see a party win\nmore than half of all the votes any\ntime soon.\nThe UK would be governed under\nendless coalitions, such as the one\nwe had in 2010-2015. This is not\nnecessarily a bad thing, but it does\nlead to inevitable compromises and\ndisagreements that typically make\nthe administration quite unstable.\nHowever, the last five years of a\nConservative led coalition with the\nLib Dems has broadly been a success.\nThe coalition was stable and an\neconomic crisis was averted.\nGenerally speaking, single party\nmajorities give the government\nthe opportunity to execute their\nmanifestos with conviction, while\ncoalitions can make the public uneasy\nabout backroom negotiations and an\nunclear mandate.\nPersonally, I would like to see a\nsingle transferable alternative voting\nsystem with constituency MPs\nremaining as our representatives,\nas this seems to be a reasonable\ncompromise between two of the\npossible three options.\nThe best of both worlds.\nWith the increased support for\n\u201cWe have\nofficially\nmoved into\na more\ncontinental\nstyle of\npolitics.\u201d\nThe next\nparliament\nis set to\nbe one of\nthe most\nvolatile and\nunstable\nin our\nhistory.\nminority parties the debate about\nelectoral reform is likely to raise its\nhead again, and it is likely that there\nis far more of an appetite for change\nnow than in 2011.\nIf we ever made the decision as a\ncountry to move to a PR system, such\nas the one in Germany, we would be\nending our nation\u2019s history of single\nparty majorities.\nBut these changes would make\nmany who currently feel that their\nvote is wasted in safe seats more likely\nto participate in our democracy,\nas any sensible, repsonsible citizen\nshould.\nAnd that, in my view, can only be a\ngood thing.\n2015 (L), the results of the 2011 AV referendum (R).

Editor-in-chief Jill Pantozzi\nwrote that \u201cWe simply can\u2019t bring\nourselves to be excited by a product\nwhich no longer meets our needs as\nfans\u201d. US Senator Claire McCaskill\nhas called for a boycott of the show,\ndescribing the storyline as \u201cdisgusting\nand unacceptable\u201d.\nSo why has this particular scene\ndrawn so much ire? Is it really the\nworst thing Game of Thrones could\nhave done? Over the seasons the\nshow has featured the bodies of men\nand women flayed alive; the charred\ncorpses of children; a pregnant\nwoman being stabbed in the belly;\nlive crucifixions; the brutal death of a\nprostitute at the hands of a psychotic\nboy king; a woman being hunted by\na pack of dogs and people wielding\ncrossbows; and one young man\u2019s\nprolonged physical and psychological\ntorture at the hands of another.\nBut this is a work of fiction. The\nshow is well known for its adult\ncontent and themes, and this\nstoryline in particular has been\nbuilding up for the last few episodes,\nsince Sansa agreed to be married\nto Ramsay in order to put her in a\nposition where she may somehow\nseek revenge on the Boltons. The\naudience had to know that there\nwould be a \u2018wedding night\u2019, and\nwe have seen enough of Ramsay\u2019s\ncharacter to know that it wasn\u2019t going\nto make for pleasant viewing.\nThe outrage seems to have centred\non the fact that this particular event\ninvolved a beloved character who\nmany people are rooting for, and that\nthe books\u2019 version of this character\nsuffered no such misery. I should\nprobably explain for the non-book\nreaders that \u2018book Sansa\u2019 is safely\nhidden away in the Eyrie where she\nwas at the start of the season; Ramsay\ninstead marries a Winterfell girl\ncalled Jeyne Poole, who is passed off\nas Arya Stark in the hope of securing\nHouse Bolton\u2019s hold on the North.\nPlayed beautifully by Sophie\nTurner, Sansa has made great leaps in\ncharacterisation recently on the show;\nher fans \u2013 and I count myself among\nthem \u2013 hope that she is really growing\ninto a strong player of the titular\nGame. After all she has suffered at the\nhands of Joffrey it is inspiring to see\nSansa taking charge of herself \u2013 so to\nsee her spirit beaten down once again\nin such a brutal fashion is indeed\ndisheartening and deeply disturbing.\nBut I strongly believe that you can\u2019t\njust cry \u201cbut that didn\u2019t happen in the\nbooks\u201d whenever you take a disliking\nto a plot line. Novels and television\nseries are very different beasts; this\nis by no means the first time that the\nshowrunners have combined plotlines\nand characters from the books in\norder to streamline the show. The\ndecision to fuse Sansa\u2019s story with\nthat of Jeyne Poole can\u2019t have been an\neasy one, but it makes sense from a\nstorytelling point of view.\nIt would be a waste of a fantastic\nactress to stash Sansa away in the\nEyrie for the remainder of the\nseason, and this plot line gives her\nthe opportunity to directly encounter\nsome of the people responsible for\nthe pain she has been through over\nthe course of the story. That is a\nfascinating turn of events \u2013 but it\nwould be bad storytelling for her\nto just barely begin maturing as\na character and then never have\nanything bad happen to her ever\nagain. It is realistic for Sansa to\nexperience setbacks in her journey\nand I for one am excited to see how\nthe character handles herself in this\ndaunting new world.\nSome have also accused the\nshowrunners of \u201c[making] that scene\nabout Theon\u2019s pain\u201d and not having\n\u201cthe courage to keep the camera on\nTurner\u2019s face\u201d; but had they chosen\ninstead to show the act directly,\nwould they not have been criticised\nfor self-aggrandisement? It\u2019s okay to\nbe upset by depictions of rape and\nsexual violence in the media, and I\u2019m\nnot saying that no one should express\nthose feelings. But I disagree with\naccusations that the show is \u201cgross,\nexploitative, and totally out of ideas\u201d.\nGame of Thrones has been quite\nrightly criticised for its depiction\nof sexual violence in the past.\nI was horrified to hear that the\nshowrunners did not feel that they\nhad portrayed a rape in the infamous\nscene between Cersei and Jaime last\nseason. To feature a scene that ended\nwith a person crying \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cstop,\ndon\u2019t\u201d as their sexual aggressor stated\n\u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and not consider it rape\nwas appalling and horrifying.\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that getting\nit spectacularly wrong once before\nmeans that Game of Thrones should\nbe forced to avoid such material\nin the future. People don\u2019t like to\nsee rape used as a stimulus for plot\ndevelopment, and it\u2019s true that this\nhas been done extremely poorly in\nmany stories over the years. Critics\nhave claimed that Sansa\u2019s storyline\nhas been altered only to further that\nof Theon/Reek, but I am going to wait\nand see the consequences play out.\nThe world of Game of Thrones\nhas always been, in the words of A\nSong of Ice and Fire author George\nR. R. Martin, \u201cno darker nor more\ndepraved than our own\u201d. Sometimes\nart makes us uncomfortable when\nit confronts us with the things that\nhumans have done \u2013 and still do\n\u2013 to one other. Whilst I certainly\ndon\u2019t want to see sexual violence\ntaken lightly, its depiction in\npopular culture is both important\nand sometimes necessary. With\nappropriate viewer warning I see no\nreason to avoid telling stories of rape.\nGame of Thrones has courted\ncontroversy before, and I have no\ndoubt that it will do so again before\nthe story draws to a close; but in the\nwords of its creator:\n\u201cRape and sexual violence have been\na part of every war ever fought, from\nthe ancient Sumerians to our present\nday. To omit them from a narrative\ncentered on war and power would have\nbeen fundamentally false and dishonest,\nand would have undermined one of\nthe themes of the books: that the true\nhorrors of human history derive not from\norcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.\nWe are the monsters. (And the heroes\ntoo). Each of us has within himself the\ncapacity for great good, and great evil.\u201d\n\u2013George R. R. Martin\nThis is not the first time Game of Thrones has been criticised for the way it features rape and sexual violence. Photo: HBO\n\"Game of\nThrones\nhas been\nquite\nrightly\ncriticised\nfor its\ndepiction\nof sexual\nviolence in\nthe past\"\n\"you can\u2019t\njust cry\n\u201cbut that\ndidn\u2019t\nhappen in\nthe books\u201d\nwhenever\nyou take a\ndisliking to\na plot line\"\n\n"

They have what looks\nlike an empty drum, with a sheer side\nto it, sitting in the earth, and then\nthere\u2019s a hole that\u2019s a pure cylinder.\nThere are figures \u2013 people of the\nworld \u2013 that are falling into it, but at\nthe same time there are figures that\nare rising out of it. I guess that\u2019s the\nmost important thing.\nThe other thing is that Carol Ann\n[Duffy, who adapted Everyman] is a\npoet, obviously, so I thought it would\nbe interesting to make it seem as\nthough there were nothing on stage so\nthat you listened to the poetry.\nBecause it\u2019s set in the present\nday, we wanted [Everyman] to be\na recognisable person. We\u2019d say\nhe was in London, he was wealthy,\nand he probably worked in Soho.\nThat would explain his friends, and\nwhat was it generally feels like. [We\nwanted] to explain in a subliminal\nway, not an illustrated way \u2013 that\nwas the key thing, to not actually\nillustrate, but to give the atmosphere,\nto make it feel like you\u2019re in Soho\nwith beautiful neon light, or street\nlights, or whatever, in the rain. So it\u2019s\nsubliminal, but that\u2019s what the floor\nand the LED screen are trying to feel\nlike.\nJS: Do you feel the design worked\nin the end?\nIM: Well, one does these things,\nand one does them as best one can\nand tries to be clear without words,\nmeaning that audience don\u2019t hear you\ntalk about it, they come and look at\nit. A design\u2019s a thing that has to speak\nwithout words: not speak, convey\natmosphere, make you feel things and\nbe an environment that things can\nfair enough. So, successful or not, I\nfeel alright about it.\nJS: I thought it was fantastic, I\nreally enjoyed seeing it in action.\nWith regards to the process for\nEveryman \u2013 were you involved with\nRufus Norris [the director] & Carol\nAnn from the start?\nIM: I\u2019ve known Rufus for a very long\ntime, we\u2019ve done quite a few shows\ntogether. It was [originally] a different\nplay, which didn\u2019t get delivered, it\nmissed the deadline, so then he chose\nto do this. He made the decision, and\nthen we were in a meeting ten days\nlater.\nFor Carol Ann, he gave her this\nwhole thing to do without a particular\nset of instructions. She did all of it,\nand then he met her, which I thought\nwas quite a smart thing to do; she\ncould get a draft out, and then there\ncould be a thing to respond to. Then\nthere were two weeks of workshop,\nseparated by a month or so, with\nactors, where ideas were tested. By\nthe first workshop, we had an idea of\nthe design, which was a bit different\nfrom how it now is. For the second\nworkshop, I think we had this design.\nSo I sat in the workshops and watched\nthem choreograph, really, and test\nsome text. And that\u2019s quite fun,\nbecause you\u2019re all working at the same\ntime. There\u2019s not a lot one can do\noneself, but being there, part of the\natmosphere, seeing the choreography\nand the language of it \u2013 I can\u2019t say\nhow it helped, but it does, the more\nyou are feeling like you\u2019re all trying\nto do the same piece, the better. That\u2019s\nthe danger of these things, you\u2019re all\ntrying to do a different piece.\nThere were quite a few meetings of\njust me, Rufus and Nicky [Gillibrand],\nthe costume designer. She was at all\nour meetings. There\u2019re times when\nonly costumes are telling you what\u2019s\ngoing on, and scenery is not, and [it]\ntakes a lot of trust on everybody\u2019s\npart to decide amongst you who has\nresponsibility at any given moment.\nIt\u2019s quite a job, and I really enjoy that\nbit, because it involves a lot of trust,\nnot just people going off on their own\nand producing an outcome, but you\u2019re\nall together. You can decide what you\nthink about it, but how you manifest\nit, how you make it understandable to\nan audience is a lot of work. It\u2019s quite\nvulnerable work, so to have colleagues\nthat you care about and respect and\nthat you can be vulnerable in front of\nis great.\nJS: So Everyman was at the National,\nhow does that compare to other\ntheatres, other shows, even other\ncountries that you\u2019ve worked in?\nIM: I try and work in theatres that\nare supportive of the kind of things\nI just described. I work quite hard to\nbe welcomed in those places, where\nyou don\u2019t have to know everything\n\"A design is\na thing that\nhas to speak\nwithout\nwords, to\nconvey an\natmosphere\"\n\"It\u2019s quite a\njob, and it\ninvolves a\nlot of trust\n... you\u2019re\nall in it\ntogether\"\nA scene from the National Theatre\u2019s current production of Everyman, for which Ian MacNeil designed t\n\n"

Photo: Tristram Kenton\nJack Steadman has never seen Carmen, but that doesn\u2019t matter\nSimons Stephens ranks as one\nof Britain\u2019s most prolific\nplaywrights, which makes it\nno surprise that, fresh off the run\nof Birdland at the Royal Court last\nsummer, he\u2019s already back, this\ntime in the Almeida Theatre in the\ntheatre with Carmen Disruption, a\nmusing on life, love and loss in an\nunnamed European city.\nAs the title suggests, Carmen\nDisruption follows (somewhat loosely,\ntruth be told) the structure of Bizet\u2019s\nopera, using the characters and\nthemes of that work to examine the\nlife of an opera singer, travelling from\ncountry to country, always playing\nthe same role \u2013 always playing\nCarmen.\nThe Singer in question is played\nwonderfully by Sharon Small, who\ncaptures the confusion and loss of\nidentity that sits at the heart of the\ncharacter.\nWhen you spend every day of your\nlife playing at being someone else\n\u2013 and playing at being one, specific\nperson at that \u2013 how do you continue\nto draw the boundary between their\nlife and yours?\nThe Singer is in a situation far\nremoved from ordinary people\u2019s lives\n\u2013 even from ordinary actor\u2019s lives,\nin fact. Very few people live the way\nopera singers do, with many singers\nsimply playing the same role across\nmultiple different productions.\nStephens acknowledges this fact\nas the inspiration for the entire\nplay, with the work spiralling out\nof an interview with Rinat Shaham,\nan internationally-famous mezzo-soprano who has played Carmen more\nthan 400 times.\nThat unique situation should mean\nthat The Singer is alien to us, so\ndistant that it makes it impossible to\ntruly empathise with her, but therein\nlies the genius of Stephens\u2019 script and\nSmall\u2019s performance.\nThe Singer\u2019s weariness, her\nconfusion, all of it, all blends to give\nsomething achingly human, speaking\nto a truth that exists in a world\nbeyond opera.\nThe other characters allow\nStephens to examine different facets\nof this underlying loneliness, as he\nmanipulates the original character\narchetypes into something new and\nexciting.\nCarmen becomes a young,\nhandsome male prostitute (with\na strong sense of his own looks),\nplayed with hilarious bravado by Jack\nFarthing.\nDon Jose, Carmen\u2019s love interest in\nthe original, now becomes a female\ntaxi driver (Noma Dumezweni),\nforced to do one last, suspiciously\ncriminal job before meeting her long-lost child.\nThe bullfighter Escamillo is now\na high-flying banker-type, played\nby John Light, with a self-serving\ncriminal bent.\nHe is the last to be introduced,\nalthough he\u2019s rapidly the most\nengaging as his attempts at financial\ngain threaten to backfire and crush\nhim.\nThe \u2018nice girl\u2019 Micaela(Katie West)\nis a student (at what can only be\npresumed to be a university \u2013 the\ncity, and by extension wherever\nshe is studying \u2013 goes unnamed\nthroughout) fresh out of a\nrelationship with her sixty three-year-old professor.\nThis particular situation is\nreferenced from the start, but only\nbecomes clear about two-thirds of the\nway into the play, at which point it\nprovoked an audible gasp from the\naudience I was in.\nThis steady unwinding, with the\noccasional floor-shaking revelation,\nis the case for all of the characters, as\neach are given their own moment to\nshine.\nCarmen\u2019s mistreatment at the\nhands of a client, and his immediate\nrevenge is a weird mixture of comedy\nand disgust.\nThere\u2019s an unflinching honesty in it\nthat means you can\u2019t look away, as the\nworld Stephens has built draws you\nin, inexorably.\nThe play\u2019s composition is part of\nthis allure \u2013 none of the characters\ndirectly interact with each other at\nany point.\nThey cross paths in-world \u2013 each is\nreferenced in the other\u2019s stories, but\nthe closest to a direct interaction is\nthe moment the Singer realises that\neach of them represents a character\nfrom the opera. Or at least, represents\nthat character\u2019s archetype.\nThe whole thing is essentially a\nseries of overlapping monologues,\nintertwined with bursts of song from\nthe mezzo-soprano Viktoria Vizin\nas the Chorus, accompanied by two\ncellists who sit on the side of the stage,\nin full view of the audience.\nAlmost all of the music is played\nby the duo live, with styles ranging\nfrom the classical (including,\nobviously, snatches of Carmen itself)\nto abrasively modern.\nIt\u2019s a bold choice, and one that reaps\nrewards.\nThe combination of the cellists\nand Vizin\u2019s soaring voice raises\ngoosebumps, searing itself into your\nmemory instantly.\nAnd all of that is before you get to\nthe set.\nThe live music may have been a\nbold move, but the set is an even\nbolder one \u2013 a literal deconstruction\nof the environment, of both Carmen\nand the unnamed city.\nA bull, presumably the one killed in\nCarmen\u2019s climax, is sprawled centre-stage. All around it, rubble. Bricks,\nscattered across the space.\nThe rear wall and wings of the\ntheatre are fully exposed, with the\nmechanisms of theatre \u2013 the lights,\nthe speakers, the cables that run\nbetween them, all on completely open\ndisplay.\nIt\u2019s a stark image, unlike almost\nany other on London stages. It\ngoes beyond a kind of minimalism,\nmoving from an emptiness to a\nphysically crumbling theatre. At\none point, rubble even falls from the\nceiling.\nThis, combined with the music\nand the performances, which display\nintense emotion mixed with a\ndisconnected distance \u2013 from each\nother, and from the world at large \u2013 is\nwhat makes Carmen Disruption a truly\nmemorable experience.\nThe imagery of the show is burnt\nonto your retinas, the music lingers in\nyour ears, and Carmen is truly reborn.\nCarmen Disruption is at the Almeida\nTheatre until 23rd\nMay. Tickets from \u00a39,\navailable online.\n\n"

I\u2019d like to reassure everyone that\nthere are no problems with any animal testing\noccuring at Imperial, and that everything we do\nat this world-leading institution is above-board\nand entirely ethically sound. Although, saying\nthat, I wouldn\u2019t mind doing some unethical tests\non those bloody protestors.\u201d\nThe weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building\nBlue News\nProvost Post\nof the Week\nEvery week, a member of\nour esteemed Provost board\nshares their thoughts with\nour collaborative, cohesive\ncommunity. This week, we\nwelcome back Al Pologies,\nVice Provost (Arbitrary\nExcuses)!\nUnsurprisingly, Al was\nunavailable to write his\ncolumn, as he encountered\nan unfortunate issue with his\ncomputer.\nHe was able to send us this\nshort extract from what we\npresume would have been his\ncolumn!\n\u201cLOST MY ID CARD STOP\nLOCKED OUT OF FACULTY\nBUILDING STOP SEND HELP\nIMMEDIATELY STOP OH GOD I\nTHINK THEY FOUND ME STOP\nYES THE STUDENTS HAVE\nFOUND ME STOP SEND HELP\nSTOP HELP STOP\u201d\nWe\u2019re not sure why Al sent his\nmessage by telegraph, to be\nhonest!\nWe knew that technology\nwas lagging behind our high-tech offices here in the Faculty\nBuilding, but I don\u2019t think any\nof us realised that the outside\nworld was that far behind!\nIt\u2019s almost enough to make\nyou want to never leave the\nFaculty Building!\nOf course, we all know that\nstaying in the Faculty Building is\nstill, sadly, impossible. Even at\nImperial we haven\u2019t discovered\nthe secret to surviving without\nfood, which means venturing\nforth beyond those glorious\nblue walls.\nOf course, we\u2019re looking into\nthe possibility of replacing\nthe old Vice Provost (Student\nVoice)\u2019s office with a canteen for\nFaculty Building staff.\nAfter all, if we could introduce\nthe Sixth Floor sleeping pods so\nsuccessfully (I myself have been\nknown to take the occasional\nnap there!), why couldn\u2019t we\nintroduce a canteen for our\nstaff?\nSoon (timings to be\nannounced shortly), we hope\nthat it will become possible to\narrive in the Faculty Building\nat 8am on a Monday morning,\nand then stay until it\u2019s time\nto go home at 5pm on Friday\nafternoon! How wonderful!\nHello all,\nGood morning, good morning, good morning! Welcome to another fine\nedition of Blue News! I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s our best issue so far, but we\u2019ve\nhad such a fantastic quality of our recent issues that I\u2019m loath to call any\none issue \u2018the best\u2019.\nIn fact, I\u2019d like to take the chance to use this issue to highlight just what\na wonderful thing Blue News really is. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of the\nintense amount of collaboration that goes on behind-the-scenes to\nmake this delightfully informative piece of joy a reality each week, but I\nfelt a full appreciation of the key collaborators was long overdue.\nFirstly, this entire project was the brainchild of our gorgeous and\nincredibly talented Vice Provost (Marketing), Em (Perial), who saw the\nlack of informative, aesthetically pleasing, well-produced newsletters in\nthe Faculty Building.\nInstead of despairing at her inability to receive the weekly goings-on\nhere in the Faculty Building in one simple, easy-to-read (and easy on the\neye!) newsletter, Em thought to herself: why don\u2019t I just make one? It\u2019s\nthis kind of blue-sky thinking, can-do attitude that helps Imperial such a\nworld-leading institution.\nWithout such out-of-the-box thinking, we could never manage to be as\nsuccessful as we are! I hope you\u2019ll all join me in giving Em our thanks\nfor helping make everyone\u2019s lives here in the Faculty Building so much\nbetter than they were in the dull, grey days before Blue News!\nOf course, Blue News wouldn\u2019t be possible without the wonderful work\nof the lovely boys over in Comms, who spend at least thirty minutes\neach week laying out this wonderful burst of information. Without them,\nwe\u2019d be reduced to having to send you all a boring, unimaginative black-and-white staff briefing email with the latest news and juicy educational\ntidbits in bullet point form - and we\u2019d have to number each one, too!\nSo thank you, one and all, for allowing this delightful organ to continue!\nHave a productive, cohesive, collaborative and happy day!\n\n"

Photo: theartsdesk\nJack Steadman definitely does, and so does Michael Wynne\nThe title of Michael Wynne\u2019s\nlatest work, Who Cares, is both\ndeliberately provocative and\nperfectly explanatory of what the\naudience entering the Royal Court\nhave signed themselves up for.\nThis production for the Jerwood\nTheatre Upstairs is less \u2018state of\nthe nation\u2019 and more \u2018state of the\nnational health service\u2019, a no-holds\nbarred examination of how the\nNHS has fared, is faring, and will\nfare under the previous and future\ngovernments.\nThe play poses a series of striking\nquestions, the first of which is\nnothing to do with the NHS, but is\ninstead \u201cwhere the hell am I going?\u201d\nOstensibly taking place in the\nCourt\u2019s studio theatre, the show\nactually kicks off by queueing in the\nalley next to the theatre, between\nit and the rehearsal/office building\nlocated next door.\nThe doors to the rehearsal building\nare opened, and each audience\nmember is given a coloured lanyard\n(most of which mark out audience\nmembers as \u2018patients\u2019, curiously) and\nushered into a waiting room ripped\nstraight out of a hospital Accident &\nEmergency department.\nA small group of actors occupy seats\nin the centre of the room, in various\nstates of disarray. Blue curtains, of\nthe same sort that can be found in\nhospitals across the country, obscure\nthe edges of the room. Double doors\nare dotted throughout, with the\noccasional blurred figure moving\nbehind them.\nA cleaner appears from the end\nof the room, mopping around the\nclustered audience members. Some\nmove out of the way to allow her to\nmop the patch of floor they were\nstanding on. It\u2019s all a bit awkward. All\na bit confusing.\nThis would be a negative, were it\nnot for the fact it makes the whole\nthing instantly immersive. It already\nfeels like the entire audience are\nawkwardly standing in a waiting\nroom, hoping for instructions.\nSuddenly, without warning, all hell\nbreaks loose.\nActors appear from all sides,\nblasting through one set of double\ndoors into the waiting room, only\nto immediately disappear through\nanother set.\nThe first speaker is Marjorie, a\nnurse from Yorkshire, played with\nreal warmth and humanity by\nEileen O\u2019Brien. She starts describing\nher path into the health service, as\nall around her various characters\ninterject with stories, facts, statistics\nand more.\nSome speak into a microphone\nat the side of the room, their voice\nblaring through the tannoy, some\naddress the audience directly, others\nconverse with each other. The whole\nscene is beautifully orchestrated\nchaos, and the audience are trapped\nin the middle of it. Looking in, but\nconstantly aware that there is more\ngoing on behind them. Within just a\nfew minutes, even this tiny room feels\nlike a part of something far larger.\nThen, as quickly as it began, the\nmadness stops.\nEveryone has disappeared. The\nlights rise, and the audience are\nquickly separated into groups.\nFrom here, the promenade part\nof Who Cares really comes into\nforce, as the existence of multiple\ngroups allows for the existence of\nseveral short scenes that can all run\nconcurrently, with each group then\nbeing guided onto the next.\nIt can only have been nothing\nshort of a logistical nightmare to\nwork out where everyone should be\n(and when), a process honed to a fine\ndegree during previews, and it\u2019s to the\nimmense credit of everyone involved\nin the production \u2013 from the front\nof house staff physically guiding the\naudience members from station to\nstation to the cast themselves, playing\nmultiple roles, often with mere\nseconds to change ahead of the arrival\nof an audience \u2013 that it all comes\ntogether so magnificently.\nThe production makes use of all of\nthe space available to the Royal Court\nbar the main theatre \u2013 nothing is off-limits here. The stage door becomes\njust another entrance; the storage\nlocations in the roof of the building\nturn into an operating theatre.\nIt\u2019s in this operating theatre at the\nvery top of the building that one of\nthe more memorable scenes takes\nplace, as a former Chief Executive of\nthe NHS and an ex-Department of\nHealth National Director discuss the\nrelationship between politicians and\nthe NHS while they dissect a corpse.\nExcept, in this instance, the \u2018corpse\u2019\nis actually one of the dummies seen\nin classrooms across the country,\nused to teach pupils basic anatomy.\nThe plastic entrails soon end up\neverywhere, with one lung even\nending up being thrust into an\nunsuspecting audience member\u2019s\nhands.\nThe Ex-Exec and former Director\nleg it, leaving a confused nursing\nteam (and a somewhat startled\naudience member) to pick up the\npieces as the audience are ushered\nout. A fine metaphor for the NHS, if\never there were one.\nFrom that point onwards, the play\nbegins to deal with two main issues:\nthe inquiry into the Mid-Staffs\nhospital trust, and the passage of the\n2012 Health and Social Care Act.\nThere\u2019s a real sense of anger that\nruns through these scenes, with some\ntruly heart-breaking testimonies\nbeing given as well as detailed,\nunflinching political analysis.\nThere\u2019s an unswerving sense of\nrealism occupying the whole play,\nparticularly in theses scenes, and\nthere\u2019s a very good reason for that.\nWho Cares is based, entirely, on\ninterviews with people across the\nNHS: With patients, campaigners,\ncleaners, nurses, students, junior\ndoctors, GPs, consultants, surgeons,\nChief Executives, anyone and\neveryone who has any dealings with\nthe NHS.\nTheir words are reproduced\nverbatim, reeled off by a talented\ncast, who imbue each character with\na sense of the real person originally\nspeaking the words, even when\nfaced with the unenviable task \u2013 as\nmentioned \u2013 of handling multiple\nroles.\nThe closing moments of Who Cares\nare unspeakably moving. There\u2019s such\na visceral sense of pain and anger at\nwhat\u2019s happening to the NHS that\nit\u2019s impossible not to feel moved, and\nthere are more than a few damning\nverdicts on the political mishandling\nof the service as a whole.\nIt\u2019s most fitting, though, that the\nplay ends as it began, with Marjorie\naddressing the audience directly.\nThe NHS may be bureaucratic and\nincomprehensibly sprawling. It may\nat times feel deeply impersonal, and\ncold.\nBut the people who work in it, for it,\nare humans too, and many (if not all)\nof them are wonderful human beings\nwho do it because they care.\nThe personal touch matters. That\nwe receive it even in this facsimilie of\nthe NHS is truly marvellous.\n\n"

That, rapidly\nfollowed by \u201chang on, have we even\nstarted?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a unique and bold use of\nthe Temporary Theatre, and an\ninstantly striking re-opening for the\nNational\u2019s fourth theatre. Formerly\nknown as The Shed, the Temporary\nTheatre wasn\u2019t even meant to be here\nanymore.\nBut here we are, at the start of a new\nseason of innovative and exciting\nworks.\nKicking things off is Beyond Caring,\noriginally penned by Alexander\nZeldin before undergoing extensive\nwork through workshops with the\ncompany.\nIt tells the story of three zero-hour\nworkers, hired to clean a meat factory\nalongside a full-time cleaner and a\nvaguely sociopathic boss.\nAs a consequence, designer Natasha\nJenkins has opted to turn the entire\nspace into the meat factory, with the\nrows of the audience looking, and\nfeeling, as if they have been simply\ndropped into the space by some\nunknown force.\nA fridge, a hot-drink-dispensing\nvending machine and other break-room clutter are visible off towards\none of the emergency exits.\nOn the other side of the room,\nshelves upon shelves of cleaning\nequipment sit, looking suspiciously\nlike someone forgot to cover them up\nbefore the audience comes in.\nThe whole space feels like that,\nhonestly. Fluorescent lights dangle\nfrom the ceiling, acting as the house\nlights.\nThe Temporary Theatre doesn\u2019t feel\nlike a theatre at all, it doesn\u2019t even\nfeel like a studio space. It feels like\na meat factory. It\u2019s a masterpiece of\nminimalist design.\nAfter a few moments of awkward\nsilence, as the front-of-house team\nclose the doors but any actors fail to\nmaterialise, one of the emergency exit\ndoors swings open.\nA man walks in, collects a book\nfrom the messy table that sits in the\ncentre of the room, and leaves again.\nA door slams. Another awkward\npause follows.\nThe doors swing open again, and a\nnew figure arrives. They look around\nawkwardly, waiting for something to\nhappen. The doors swing open again.\nAnd so on.\nBeyond Caring has significant\nballs, that much is already obvious.\nIt\u2019s willing to leave the audience\ndangling, providing them with no\nexplanation or description of what\u2019s\ngoing on (or even supposed to be\ngoing on). All we have is what we see\nin front of us.\nAnd what we see is brutal. Nothing\ntruly awful happens here. There are\nno spectacular outbursts of violence.\nNobody dies. There isn\u2019t a hero, with\nsome unspeakable evil he\u2019s destined\nto confront. None of that.\nInstead, there\u2019s just an insidious\nsense of dread, a pervading\ndiscomfort that clings to you long\nafter you walk out of the theatre.\nThe four cleaners, Grace, Susan,\nBecky and Phil try to make it through\neach night, leaving as the sun rises.\nThrough the small hours, they clean\nthe various parts of the factory, under\nthe watchful, slightly malicious eye\nof Ian.\nOf all the characters, Ian\u2019s is\nthe hardest to get a grip on. His\nnastiness isn\u2019t always outright cruelty\n(although it occasionally verges into\nit), it\u2019s more just an absence of caring.\nHe can\u2019t empathise with the people he\nsees as beneath him.\nThis dynamic proves the main\ndriving force of the play, which is\notherwise content to simply let its\ncharacters be, and to use their mere\nexistence as a window to examine\nthe nature of zero-hours contracts,\nand what working on one can do to a\nperson.\nIt\u2019s a fully issue-driven play, to the\npoint where a whiteboard behind\nthe box office records the latest news\non zero-hour contracts for all to see,\noften picking up on various political\npledges across the board.\nBefore, during, and now after an\nelection that saw a Conservative\ngovernment with little care for the\nplight of zero-hour workers, Beyond\nCaring could scarcely feel more\ntopical.\nNot that this politics is explicitly\naddressed in the play, mind. Far from\nit.\nThis is such a tightly focused\npiece of work that it doesn\u2019t have\ntime to discuss grand ideas, or even\nthe machinations of government \u2013\nthese are people who are focused on\nsurviving.\nTheir struggles are those of people\nliving from paycheck to paycheck.\nWhen two of the girls discover their\nagency won\u2019t be paying them for\nanother week, their world falls apart.\nOne desperately tries to get a single\nday off to go and visit her daughter,\nto no avail.\nOne attempts to deal with the\nsituation she now finds herself in,\nforced to work because a government\nagency hasn\u2019t deemed her \u2018disabled\nenough\u2019 to qualify for disability\nallowance.\nPolitical promises don\u2019t enter\ninto it. All this is sold by the acting.\nThe cast were involved in devising\nthe piece, and it shows, giving their\ncharacters a weary, lived-in fa\u00e7ade\nthat feels unbearably real.\nThey have arcs, of sorts, and from\nthat they each have redeeming\nmoments \u2013 some of which are enough\nto make you weep. Or at least, they all\ndo, bar Ian.\nHe occasionally provides comic\nrelief, occasionally provides a figure\nof mutual hatred, but he doesn\u2019t\nreally change.\nHe\u2019s never truly redeemed, which\ndoesn\u2019t do Luke Clarke\u2019s performance\njustice.\nThis is gut-wrenching stuff,\nand even though it\u2019s so seemingly\nmundance on the face of it \u2013 wages,\nhours, illness \u2013 it matters so much\nto the characters, just as it matters\nso much to so many people in this\ncountry, in this moment, that it can\u2019t\nhelp but grip you.\nIt\u2019s impossible to look away, even\nwhen you desperately want to, even\nwhen you need to.\nThese people can\u2019t escape their\nsituation. Why should you be able to?\nBeyond Caring is at the Temporary\nTheatre (National Theatre) until\nSaturday 23rd\nMay. Tickets from \u00a315,\navailable online.\nPhil (Sean O\u2019Callaghan) and Grace (Janet Etuk) in Beyond Caring at the National Theatre.

A group of women were\nturned away from a screening of Todd\nHaynes\u2019 lesbian romance film Carol,\naccording to Screen magazine.\nThe women, some of whom\nreportedly cannot wear heels due\nto medical conditions, were denied\nentry to the event despite wearing\n\u2018smart\u2019 rhinestone-studded shoes. The\nfestival declined to comment on the\nincident, but confirmed that women\nare obligated to wear high heels to\nred-carpet screenings.\nAsif Kapadia, director of the\nhighly anticipated Amy Winehouse\ndocumentary Amy, tweeted that\nhis wife had also been turned away\nfrom a festival event, though she was\n\u201ceventually let in\u201d.\nFilm producer Valeria Richter,\nwho has had part of her left foot\namputated, also claimed to have been\nstopped \u201cfour times\u201d by staff at the\npremier for The Sea of Trees.

Although, inevitably, I\u2019m\nabout to try.\nIt can be succinctly described as\nthe unholy offspring of The Muppets,\nSesame Street and the real world,\nblending classic Jim Henson-style\npuppetry with irreverent humour and\nadult themes.\nThere\u2019s a vicious streak of satire\nrunning through the entire thing,\nand the use of puppets is just a cutesy\nsmoke-screen for the grown-up, ugly\ngoings-on underneath.\nAvenue Q is a frank look at life post-education, at the time when you feel\nlike you should really be getting a grip\non your life, working a solid career,\nfinding love, settling down, all that\njazz. Avenue Q sticks two fingers up\nat that.\nSaid two-fingered salute\ncommences from the opening song.\nNewly graduated Princeton (Richard\nLowe) appears, sings a few lines about\nfeeling that he could change the\nworld, and then the real thing starts.\nKate Monster (Sarah Harlington)\nand Brian (Richard Morse) get the ball\nrolling with \u2018It Sucks to be Me\u2019, which\nwithin the space of a few minutes lays\nout the themes that the rest of the\nmusical will follow.\nAll this takes place around one,\nstatic set \u2013 the titular Avenue Q.\nA run-down block of houses, it\nappears deceptively simple, initially\nlooking just like some doors and\nwindows for the cast to enter/exit\nthrough or appear in while looking\nout.\nIt quickly turns out there\u2019s more\nto it than that. At various points, the\nfronts of the houses lower down to\nreveal a miniature interior, acting as a\nneat background to the goings on that\nremoves the need for complicated\nscene changes.\nThere\u2019s also a large section that\ndetaches and opens up to become a\nbar for one scene, adding a greater\nlevel of change that originally looked\nunlikely. Throw in a neatly-lit\nbackdrop (and at least one massive\ninflatable head that pops up from\nbehind the houses), and it\u2019s a clever\nway to achieve a lot with a little.\nTouring productions always have\na variety in quality, not least in\ntheir set, so it\u2019s a genuine treat to\nsee something that\u2019s so simple yet\nfunctional without any obvious\ndetractors.\nThe way the cast move around the\nset is also ingenious, with judicious\nuse of multiple puppets (and an\nensemble to operate them) allowing\nthe likes of Trekkie Monster (Stephen\nArden) to appear at completely\ndifferent ends of the stage within\nseconds for such musical treats as\n\u2018The Internet is for Porn\u2019.\nIf you didn\u2019t already know that\nwas one of the song titles: you\u2019re in\nfor a treat. A treat compounded by\nthe likes of \u2018If You Were Gay\u2019, which\nmanages the delicate double act of\nbeing slightly offensive and hugely\nentertaining (while also slyly taking\nthe mickey out of Sesame Street\u2019s\nBert and Ernie), and \u2018Everyone\u2019s a\nLittle Bit Racist\u2019, which manages to\nbe hugely offensive and even more\nentertaining.\nA double win in everyone\u2019s book\n(except, perhaps, the easily offended,\nwho probably shouldn\u2019t be here\nanyway).\nThose three songs are easily the\nmusical highlights, although that\u2019s a\nrelative term in a musical as strong\nas this. The songs are all either side-splittingly hilarious or touchingly\nemotional.\nAs with almost all musicals, the\nearlier songs are the strongest (which\nis where \u2018Internet\u2019, \u2018Racist\u2019 and \u2018Gay\u2019\ncome in), but the quality doesn\u2019t let\nup for the rest of the show.\n\u2018There\u2019s a Fine, Fine Line\u2019 is a cute\nAct 1 finale, while \u2018Schadenfreude\u2019 is\na merciless mockery of how, despite\nour pretensions, we all still take\nsignificant amounts of pleasure in the\nmisery of others.\nAvenue Q doesn\u2019t really let up\nthroughout its run-time, taking as\nmany pot-shots at as many targets\nas it can possible think of (and then\na few more besides), even going so\nfar as to at one point send the cast\nround, caps literally in hand, to beg a\nfew quid off the audience. And then\ncomplain about their pitiful take.\nThe story does weaken somewhat\nby the end, relying on some obvious\ncontrivances, but it\u2019s all in such good\nhumour (and so patently ridiculous)\nthat the only choice is to accept it,\nlaugh at it, and move on \u2013 arguably a\ngood idea for life, truth be told.\nThere are a few minor flaws \u2013 the\nsound is sometimes a little weak,\nnot always doing the (naturally\nsmall, due to the touring nature of\nthis production) band justice, while\nthe use of a couple of video screens\ndetracts from the high production\nvalues elsewhere. The screens are\ntiny, the animation is low quality, and\nwere it not for the fact they\u2019re needed\nfor a couple of plot-advancing jokes\nthe show would be better off without\nthem.\nFortunately, the flaws are\noutweighed by the quality on display\nelsewhere, not least in the cast.\nEvery single cast member is\nflawless, and the hours upon hours\n(upon hours upon hours) of rehearsal\ntime they must have spent with the\npuppets has paid off handsomely\n\u2013 the puppets are seamlessly\nintegrated into the show, with the\noccasional hand-offs necessitated by\nhaving several key roles doubled-up\noccurring seamlessly, to the point\nwhere most of the audience barely\neven notice.\nHonestly, you hardly notice the\npuppeteers generally \u2013 as with the\nMuppets, the puppets are instantly\naccepted as \u2018real\u2019 without question,\nand the fact that even here, where\nthere is so clearly someone standing\nbehind the puppet and controlling\ntheir every movement, that\u2019s still the\ncase is something genuinely magical.\nThis magic is rounded off by such\ninspired moments of genius as the\nBad Idea Bears, which do exactly\nwhat the name suggests, providing\nsome truly terrible ideas with\ninfectious enthusiasm and adorable\nappearances.\nQuick side-note: to whoever runs\nthe Bad Idea Bears Twitter account\n(and yes, obviously that exists): you\nare responsible for the greatest piece\nof theatre marketing ever.\nCredit must also go to whoever\u2019s\nbeen responsible for ensuring that\neach theatre, alongside the usual\nstrobe and haze warnings, have been\nputting up signs warning audiences of\n\u2018mild puppet nudity.\u2019\nConsider yourselves warned.\nThis review is based on the production\nat the Mercury Theatre, Colchester.\nAvenue Q is currently at Greenwich\nTheatre until Sun 26th\nMay.\nTickets from \u00a320, available online.\nThe Cast of the UK touring production of Avenue Q, waiting for a rehearsal to start.

The correct number is 18.\n\u201cAs ICL [Imperial College London]\nis fully aware (because it has the\nBUAV report), the BUAV made\nnothing like 180 allegations of noncompliance and the Home Office has\ndeclined to detail what it took to be\nsuch allegations.\n\u201cBut the important point is that\nit is clear that the Home Office only\ninvestigated 18 allegations.\u201d\nThe BUAV had previously released\nan eight-minute video that they\nthemselves described as \u201charrowing\nand disturbing evidence,\u201d and later\nproduced a 71 page report detailing\nthe findings, which was presented to\nthe then Home Office Minister Lord\nTaylor of Holbeach.\nThe Home Office concluded in\ntheir report upon review of the BUAV\nmaterial that \u201cnothing was identified\nto suggest either referral for\nprosecution or immediate suspension\nof licences on welfare grounds were\nmerited\u201d.\nThe BUAV are also criticising\nImperial for perceived negligence,\nstating that there should be staff\npresent at all hours on location after\nanimals have undergone invasive\nsurgery.\nHowever, an Imperial college\nspokesperson has addressed the issue,\nstating: \u201cAlthough there is not a\nmember of care staff present on site\n24/7 there is always at least one vet\nplus five senior animal care staff on\ncall 24/7 to attend to any emergencies\noutside working hours.\n\u201cThe environmental parameters for\nthe animals are monitored 24 hours\na day by computer and will alarm\nwhen the parameters fall outside of\nthe Home Office Code of Practice. If\na problem occurs both maintenance\nand CBS staff are contacted by\nsecurity and where necessary attend\nsite.\u201d\nThe judicial review is currently\non-going. A spokesperson for the\nHome Office told the Times Higher\nEducation (THE) earlier this week\nthat it would not be appropriate to\ncomment whilst legal procedures are\nstill taking place.\nThe clash between Imperial and\nthe BUAV started back in April 2013,\nwhen The Sunday Times published\nthe findings of a BUAV associate who\nwas working undercover as a research\ntechnician.\nThe reporter had filmed animal\nresearch over the course of seven\nmonths, which were compiled into an\neight minute video released online.\nThe video contained graphic imagery\nof animal testing procedures, which\nmany found uncomfortable to watch.\nImperial commissioned its own\nenquiry soon after the BUAV\nallegations were released. The\nThe way that animals are treated by Imperial College has come under intense scrutiny in recent years. Photo: Alamy\ninvestigation was lead by Steve\nBrown, Director of the MRC\nMammalian Genetics Unit at\nHarwell. The enquiry began in July\n2013 and the findings were published\nthe following December (2014).\nThe Brown investigation found that\nImperial lacked \u201cadequate leadership,\nmanagement, operational, training,\nsupervisory and ethical review\nstandards,\u201d and made thirty-three\nrecommendations to the college for\nchanges to working practices.\nSaid Brown at the time of the\nreview: \u201cOur investigation identified\na number of serious concerns on the\nBUAV also claims\nImperial is \u201cmisleading\nthe public\u201d over post\noperative care.

Azeem Ward had\nplanned to create a facebook event\nof his senior flute recital at the\nUniversity of California for a few\nfamily and friends to attend at . What\nhe had not foreseen was that it would\nstart a viral craze, predominantly\nin UK universities, resulting in over\n100,000 saying they were going,\n50,000 Brits live streaming the flute\nrecital, and even one particularly\ncheeky lad taking a flight to Santa\nBarbara.\nSo flash forward to the 16th\nMay,\nexpectations were high: Azeem had\npromised us Devienne\u2019s Concerto\nNo 7, Gaubert\u2019s Sonata No 3 and\nRoitstein\u2019s Flautas, as well as the\nmore contemporary \u2018Three Beats for\nBeatbox Flute\u2019 with what promised\nto be the cheekiest of all flute recitals.\nArriving fashionably late, Azeem\nwas wearing a black waistcoat with a\nstriking red shirt, topped off with the\nfinest hat i have seen in all my years\n(M\u2019lady).\nOver the next hour and a half,\nAzeem bared his soul: he effortlessly\nglided through despair, joy, love lost,\nlove gained, melancholy, all the while\ncharming the pants off everyone\nwatching (excluding his mum). He\nenthralled the audience even further\nby cheekily placing awkwardly long\nintermissions in between the pieces,\nmaking all 50,000 of us gagging for\nmore.\nHis devil-may-care shoulder\nplacement of his flute will be what we\nremember him for in the centuries\nto come: I have a dream that in the\nfuture, everyone will worship a\nlarge vaseline monument of Azeem\non each May 16th. We will chant\nthe sweet melodious flute beatbox\nhanded down to us by the great\nWard, and then feast on the cheekiest\nNandos we can produce. Any heretic\nthat has anything lower than medium\nwill be forced to commit seppuku on\na sharpened flute, leading to a greater\nsociety\u2026\n...Oh yeah, so to summarize the\nflute recital was pretty good if you\u2019re\ninto that kinda thing.\n\n"

Enda Walsh\u2019s\n\u201cmischievous\u201d adaptation is therefore\nthe first of the three to not be a\nmusical, perhaps a touch unsurprising\ngiven its home at the Royal Court.\nIt still features its fair share of\nmusic, though, and even a spot of\nsinging, so fear not. It\u2019s not quite\nall change in the world of Dahl\nadaptations.\nThe Twits is a very different book\nfrom its fellow adaptees, however.\nIt\u2019s a much darker tale, with a pair of\ngenuinely disgusting protagonists in\nthe eponymous Twits.\nThere\u2019s no goody-two-shoes\ncharacter whose journey the book\ncharts; there\u2019s no real sense of hope;\nit\u2019s all a bit depressing up until the\nend, really.\nThere are also no children involved,\nwhich \u2013 for better or for worse \u2013\nmeans there aren\u2019t any children on\nstage in this one. Still plenty in the\naudience, mind.\nThe fact that this is an adaptation\nof a beloved children\u2019s book by a\nbeloved children\u2019s author naturally\nmeans this play is inherently targeted\nat children, an audience who aren\u2019t\nrenowned for their solo theatre-going\nskills. Or, in fact, for anything much\nbeyond being children and one day\ngrowing up.\nTo that end, the play needs to\nattract adults too, which leaves it\naiming for that somewhat Pixaresque goal of pleasing young and old\nalike.\nOn stage, the results of this need can\nprobably be summarised as \u201cmixed\u201d.\nMatilda succeeds by being\nuproariously funny \u2013 the music and\nlyrics are by Tim Minchin, for crying\nout loud \u2013 while Charlie succeeds by\nbeing little short of awe-inspiring.\nThey pumped money into that thing.\nThe Twits lacks both the hilarious\nsongs and the excessive budget, and\ndespite the best efforts of all involved\nit starts to flouder as a result.\nThe set design is ingenious, flicking\nbetween two main states: inside the\nTwits\u2019 house and outside through the\nmedium of a drawbridge, with its one\nreal moment of triumph coming late\non in the play.\nIt\u2019s very, very cleverly put together,\nand looks rather impressive, although\nit lacks the wow-factor that the likes\nof Birdland previously achieved in\nthe same building by simply dunking\nthe entire stage in a water tank.\nThe cast give it their all to make\nsure the play succeeds, with the\nMonkey Dad and Monkey Daughter\nof the captive family of monkeys\n(yes, that\u2019s a thing in this play) being\nstand-outs amongst the supporting\ncast.\nAimee-Ffion Edwards is hugely\nendearing as the Daughter, while\nGlyn Pritchard makes immediate\nefforts to steal the show as the Dad.\nThe rest of the cast are all game,\nand throw everything at it \u2013 it\u2019s just\na shame they feel a little let down by\nthe script.\n\u201cMischievously adapted\u201d feels like\na grand claim here, as the script veers\nbetween the needlessly wordy and\ndesperately trying to be funny, with\nthe majority of the humour coming\nfrom the physical rather than the\nverbal.\nIt\u2019s odd, too \u2013 the script itself is far\nmore lively on paper, with some truly\ningenious stage directions. Mrs Twit\nis at one point described as \u201ca one-eyed Scarlett Johansson\u201d, for starters.\nThe lead performances, meanwhile,\nare truly fantastic to watch \u2013 Monica\nDolan and Jason Watkins are\nspectacular as the Twits, bringing a\nmanic energy to the whole thing.\nThe stage fizzles whenever\nthey appear on it, and they are\nresponsible for (almost) all of the\nplay\u2019s best moments, ranging from\na disturbingly rock-and-roll version\nof \u2018O Little Town of Bethlehem\u2019 to\nmultiple instances of frying-pan\nbased violence.\nThe theme music (essentially\n\u2018twittwitstwitstwits\u2019 repeated over\nfrenetic guitar strumming and drum\nbashing) that accompanies their\narrivals soon grates, however.\nIt\u2019s one of the most painfully\nobvious moments where the play\nexplicitly targets the younger\nsegment of the audience, temporarily\nalienating the older portion in the\nprocess.\nIt works for the kids, though:\nI caught at least five separate\ninstances of small children chanting\n\u2018twitstwitstwitstwits\u2019 as the audience\nmade their way out of the theatre.\nExciting for them, less so for their\nparents. I\u2019d say I pity them, but they\ndid choose to have children.\nOn a serious note, it\u2019s a genuinely\nbrilliant thing that The Twits left the\nchildren in the theatre as enthused as\nit did.\nMost children\u2019s encounters with\nthe theatre consist of a seasonal\npanto (usually of dubious quality),\nand then the occasional encounter\nwith Shakespeare (usually of variable\nquality).\nIt\u2019s vital that children get to see how\nexciting, visceral, life-affirming and\ngenerally essential theatre can be,\nand so getting them engaged with real\ntheatre is incredibly important.\nThat\u2019s not to say that panto isn\u2019t\nreal theatre, it\u2019s more that The Twits\ntakes place in the Royal Court, one\nof the foremost critically-acclaimed\ntheatres in the country.\nChildren enjoying and\nremembering a trip here matters,\nand hopefully in a few years time, as\nthey start to develop interests in more\nmature works, they\u2019ll come back \u2013\nand keep coming back, and help keep\ntheatre alive.\nMore than anything else that takes\nplace in The Twits, that enthuasiasm\nit leaves with young children, that\nenjoyment for the magic of theatre,\nthat\u2019s what really counts.\nThat\u2019s the legacy The Twits will\nleave.\nBut for all that, I just wish it was a\nbetter play\nThe Twits is on at the Royal Court\nuntil 31st\nMay. Tickets from \u00a310,\navailable online.\nL-R: Mr Twit (Jason Watkins), Tattooed Fortune-Teller Lady (Christine Entwhistle), Mrs Twit (Monica Dolan) in The Twits.

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 13\n22.05.2015\nFELIX\nFilm\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk Film Editors Ellen Mathieson, John Park and Jack Steadman\nFred Fyles is hooked by a brutal piece of cinema from Ukraine\nTribal warfare on the big screen\nIt\u2019s difficult to describe the\nUkrainian film The Tribe in a\nway that doesn\u2019t make it sound\nlike an \u2018Elevator Pitch\u2019, one of those\nnebulous phrases taught in business\nschools that\u2019s supposed to ensure a\nproduct\u2019s marketability. A film set in\na school for deaf children, The Tribe\nis conducted entirely through sign\nlanguage, with no spoken dialogue, no\nsubtitles, and no explanation.\nHigh concept, it may be, but The\nTribe is far from marketable. It is\nquite possibly one of the most brutal,\ngruelling films to come out this year.\nIt also just may be one of the best.\nWe begin the film by being\nintroduced to Serhiy (Hryhoriy\nFesenko), arriving at a boarding\nschool for the deaf under a blanket\nof foul weather that never really lifts,\nsmothering the film in a uniquely\nEastern European bleakness.\nAs time goes on, Serhiy is\ndrawn deeper and deeper into the\nunderground criminal racket that\nthe older students, aided by their\nwoodworking teacher, have organised;\nthe acts depicted in full gruesome\ndetail on screen include prostitution,\ntorture, murder, and possibly human\ntrafficking \u2013 although the nature of\nthe production means that nothing\nis sure.\nThe director Myroslav\nSlaboshpytskiy throws us\ninto an unforgiving world\nof misunderstanding and\nmisinterpretation, leaving us to make\nour own decisions about who is right\nor wrong.\nAs the plot becomes more complex,\nand Serhiy becomes infatuated\nwith Anna (Yana Novikova), the\ncharacters\u2019 actions become more and\nmore difficult to read, trapped as we\nare behind a screen of muteness.\nThroughout, Slaboshpytskiy keeps\nthe camera moving, filming the\nscenes in a series of long shots that\nrequire nerves of steel to sit through,\nincluding the most harrowingly\ngraphic abortion scene I\u2019ve witnessed\nsince Cristian Mungiu\u2019s 4 Months, 3\nWeeks and 2 Days.\nThe fact that such shots were pulled\noff is testament to both the skill of\nSlaboshpytskiy, and the discerning\neye with which he assembled the cast\n\u2013 mainly amateur deaf actors.\nThey need no acting classes, no\ndrama degrees; they\u2019ve spent their\nlives using facial expression and\nmovements to get their point across,\nand the physicality of acting is like\nsecond nature to them.\nThere are some obvious reference\npoints within The Tribe, chief among\nthem being William Golding\u2019s 1954\nnovel Lord of the Flies, which centres\naround a group of schoolchildren\nbecoming feral, revealing the\ndarkness in man\u2019s heart.\nBut while the experiences of Jack,\nRalph, and Piggy were written to\nunderline the fact that mankind\nis consistently evil, The Tribe\u2019s\nenergy comes from the fact that the\nmainstream audience is consistently\nalienated.\nTaking on the experience of a\nlifetime of being The Other, the deaf\nchildren have turned the tables, and\nare now holding us at arm\u2019s length;\nour misunderstanding become a locus\nof resistance through which their\nanger is expressed.\nWhen viewed in such a way, the\nplot, which on paper can sound\nludicrous, begins to make sense:\nvilified by the community at large,\nand shipped off to an enclosed space\nin which they won\u2019t upset our idea\nof \u2018normality\u2019, the children are using\ntheir deafness as a weapon, resisting\nany form of polite society, and\nforging a world in their own image.\nThat being said, there are moments\nwhere the plot points feel somewhat\nheavy handed, and the facade of\nrealism the film holds up begins\nto slip: where are the adults at the\nschool?\nSurely, when ransacking someone\u2019s\napartment, there must be some non-deaf people in the vicinity who can\nhear what\u2019s going on?\nBut such actions only seem to\nreinforce the strange, dreamlike\nnature of the film, oppressive in its\nsilence.\nI am sure, furthermore, that there\nwill be some who are disgusted by\nthe frank, explicit nature of the film,\nparticularly the abortion scene.\nWhile I am sure there is a case for\nthis criticism, all I will say is this: The\nTribe is not meant to be an enjoyable\nfilm.\nWithout any idea of when or where\nthe film is set \u2013 some clues give\nthings away: the cyrillic alphabet; the\npresence of a MacBook \u2013 the audience\nis disengaged from temporal and\nspatial reality, cast adrift on a wave of\nalienation.\nThe removal of any spoken\nlanguage only deepens this\nexperience, with the lack of any\nform of musical accompaniment\naccentuating the silent lives of the\nchildren.\nThere are occasions when we do see\npeople talking, but they are hidden\nbehind thick glass, tantalisingly out\nof reach, making the audience long\nfor a point of contact that will never\nbe made.\nBut the soundtrack to this film\nis not one of silence. The void that\nhas been created by the loss of\nlanguage is filled with a vocabulary\nof inertia: feet squeaking on a newly\npolished floor; bottles being cracked\nsickeningly over human skulls; the\ndull thump of flesh upon flesh.\nWith our senses amplified, we are\nable to take in more than ever before,\nand this intoxication of strange\nsounds is awesomely gruesome.\nA remarkably unique piece of\ncinema, which defies the conventions\nof our idea of the medium, The Tribe\nis a complete triumph.\nIts sheer power is stunning,\ncrushing the audience into\nsubmission, and seemingly\nvacuuming out all the air in the room.\nI haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking\nabout it since the first viewing, and\nI am certain that it is a film that will\nreward revisits.\nLeaving the cinema, thrust into the\nhustle and bustle of modern London,\nI am confronted by a cacophony of\nnew sounds, as thoughts of alienation\nand belonging, violence and brutality,\nlove and life swirl around my head.\n\"A series\nof long\nshots that\nrequire\nnerves of\nsteel to sit\nthrough.\"\n\"The\nchildren\nare using\ntheir\ndeafness as\na weapon.\"\nTHE TRIBE\nDirector: Miroslav Slaboshpitsky\nScreenplay: Miroslave\nSlaboshpitsky\nCast: Grigoriy Fesenko, Yana\nNovikova, Rosa Babiy, Alexander\nDsiadevich\nActions speak louder than words Photo: Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy/Drafthouse Films\n\n"

What should\nI leave for readers to discover, and\nwhat should I reveal? The finale of the\nseries Mad Men is a perfect example.\nAs the series that taught all men\nhow to wear a suit, and all women\nhow lucky we are not to live in the\n1960s comes to an end, I wonder\nwhether it\u2019s enough of an event for\nme to spoiler, or whether I should\nhold back on what awaits Mr Donald\nDraper and colleagues.\nBasically, I feel I need to warn you\nthat there will be some spoilers, tough\nshit.\nFirst of all, what has happened to\nMad Men in the last year? After a\nvery long break, the show came back\neight weeks ago, all 1970s hairdos and\nbad moustaches.\nFor most people without a\nphotographic memory, it was almost\nimpossible to get back into the plot\nwithout a good recap. Did somebody\ndie at some point?\nThe show seemed lost, as did its\nmain character and icon Don Draper:\nforty, recently divorced, and showing\na little too many wrinkles around the\neyes.\nYeah, his second wife was a bitch (as\nwas his first one for that matter) and\nyeah he\u2019s the misunderstood son of\na prostitute/tragic Korean War vet,\nbut we can\u2019t help but feel he slightly\nbrought it on himself.\nThe years of frowns and intense\nsilences have left Don incapable of\ncommunicating with other human\nbeings and addicted to most legal, and\nat times illegal, highs.\nIn true Jack Kerouac fashion,\nthere\u2019s only one thing that can save\nhim: a long trip across the immense\nlandscapes of America. Never mind\nhis children, or work, or friends, this\nis Don Draper for fuck sake!\nUp until the finale, Don\u2019s voyage\ndidn\u2019t seem like it could have likely\nbrought him the peace he was looking\nfor: getting him robbed, bashed\nand forcing him to sell most of his\npossession on the way, ending up\nstuck in a hippie commune hugging\npeople.\nThis was all put into perspective in\nthe last three minutes of the show,\nwhen inspiration suddenly strikes\nhim, warrantying the first real smile\nof the whole show.\nIt is revealed that Don Draper is in\nfact the creator of the phenomenally\nsuccessful Coca Cola \u201cHilltop\u201d\ncommercial: an ending that also turns\nout to be a massive Coca Cola advert,\nthen. Story of our lives.\nAnd what about the rest of the cast?\nThe authors decided to make these\nplotlines, surprisingly, a little more\npredictable, finally satisfying the\nviewers\u2019 requests.\nTurns out the two heroes of the\nshow are in fact two heroines: out\nof the ashes of the booze-fuelled\nswinging Sixties rise Joan and Peggy.\nThe two are now the decision\nmakers in the game, after years of\nacting as glorified secretaries.\nThe too-sexy-for-her-own-good\nredhead has had enough of depending\non men and decides to put her less\napparent skills to good use, creating\nher own new company, that we are\nsure will eventually conquer the\nworld.\nAt McCann Erickson, on the other\nhand, Peggy has to fight to keep the\npower she\u2019s earned now she\u2019s in a big,\ncorporate agency. Thank God she\nfinally has a man and all is good in\nthis black-and-white world, since no\nwoman can really be happy without\none.\nOf course this is the part of the\nstory that ticks the big romantic kiss\nbox.\nUnfortunate, although very sweet,\nsince Mad Men had rarely had to\nrely on such clich\u00e9s to attract its\naudiences. In fact, Peggy\u2019s modest\nsurprise at her colleague Stan\nRizzo\u2019s declaration of love was a bit\nsickening, considering most viewers\nwere anticipating the scene from his\nfirst appearance.\nAll things considered, no big\nending for the show. Who knew, after\nall, Mad Men was really all about\nadvertising? No subtle meaning, no\ngrowth.\nOf course, the way women are\ntreated may have changed slightly,\nbut Don is left doing what he does\nbest: inventing jingles and seducing\nwomen.\nUltimately Man Men\u2019s was a happy\nending.\nWell, for everyone except for\nthe whole of humanity, spoilt and\ncorrupted by advertising companies\nwho take messages of love and peace\nand use them to promote carbonated\ndrinks.\nBut that\u2019s another story.\nPeople! Sitting! Smoking! Excitement! Photo: AMC\n\"Who knew\nMan Men\nwas really\nall about\nadvertising?\"\n\"In true\nJack\nKerouac\nfashion,\nthere\u2019s\nonly one\nthing that\ncan save\nhim.\"\nBrooding! Intense! Adjectives!

As Strauss was\npartaking in his first interview with\nthe media in the role Kevin Pietersen\nwas piling the pressure on, smashing\nLeicestershire\u2019s defenceless bowlers\nfor 355 not out \u2013 his highest first\nclass score.\nStrauss said that \u201cthere is no trust\u201d\nbetween Pietersen and the ECB.\nIt\u2019s an easy statement to make, and\nit\u2019s certainly true that Pietersen\nhas not been a model employee. In\n2012 Pietersen was dropped from\nthe national side after he admitted\nsending \u201cprovocative\u201d text messages\nto members of the South African\nteam, allegedly about Andrew Strauss\nhimself (although he denied this). A\nfew months later he was allowed back\ninto the side, after a reintegration\nperiod.\nPietersen was later sacked from the\nEngland side after the 5-0 thumping\nin the Ashes down under in 2014.\nHis contract was terminated and he\nbecame a freelance player, securing\ndeals in the Indian Premier League,\nthe Caribbean Premier League, the\nt20 Blast and the Big Bash League.\nHe courted controversy again\nlate last year with the release of his\nautobiography, which contained\nrevelations about several of his\nformer colleagues, including calling\nMatt Prior \u201ca Dairylea triangle\nthinking he\u2019s a Brie\u201d. Many thought\nthat any remote chance of Pietersen\ncoming back to the national set up\nhad evaporated with each criticism on\nthose pages.\nBut then, there was hope.\nIncoming ECB Chairman Colin\nGraves said in a press conference in\nMarch that anyone who gets runs in\ncounty cricket would be considered\nfor selection. Following two meetings\nwith Graves, Pietersen said, \u201cHe has\ntold me he wants the best players\nplaying for England and that there\nis a clean slate\u201c. A superb century\nagainst low calibre opposition in\nOxford was followed quickly by the\ntriple ton against Leicestershire.\nStrauss\u2019 decision on Pietersen was\nbeing made tougher and tougher.\nAs Pietersen put the finishing\ntouches on his immense 355 not out,\nStrauss was only a few miles away at\nLord\u2019s confirming that he was closing\nthe door on the maverick\u2019s selection\nfor the Ashes summer. It had been\nexpected \u2013 numerous papers had\ncarried the news in that morning\u2019s\npress. But that\u2019s where my problems\nstart with the board.\nThe day before Strauss\u2019 conference\nhe had had a private meeting with\nPietersen. During this meeting\nStrauss told him exactly what he told\nthe press the following day. But not\nthirty minutes after the meeting had\nthis information been leaked to the\npress, and Pietersen denies that it was\nhim.\nGranted, he could be lying through\nhis teeth when he says this. But if he\nisn\u2019t, then it isn\u2019t the first time the\nECB have leaked information the day\nbefore a press conference. Every man\nand his dog knew that Peter Moores\n(the England coach) was going to be\nsacked before he did. The same goes\nfor Alistair Cook when he lost the\nlimited overs captaincy late last year.\nIt\u2019s not a great trait to have.\nThere\u2019s also the small matter of\nStrauss\u2019 reasoning for not bringing\nPietersen back. Citing a lack of trust\nwould suggest that the ECB had little\nto no interest in bringing Pietersen\nback into the fold. In face they aren\u2019t\neven considering him for the rest of\nthe summer. Kevin Pietersen had\na contract for the Indian Premier\nLeague side Sunrisers Hyderabad that\nhe effectively tore up when he was\ntold that he had a chance to get back\ninto the England team. What was that\ncontract worth? \u00a3250,000.\nThat\u2019s right. Kevin Pietersen tore up\na \u00a3250,000 contract because he had\nbeen assured that he still had a shot at\nan England place. Now it transpires\nthat that it\u2019s unlikely that that was\never the case.\nThe ECB cite a lack of trust,\nbut perhaps they mean that it\u2019s\nnot Pietersen they can\u2019t trust, it\u2019s\nPietersen who can\u2019t trust them.\nThey talk about a lack of trust. Yet\nAndrew Strauss was perfectly happy\nto offer Pietersen an advisory role\nin the limited overs set up. In what\nworld can you not trust someone\nenough to be in your team, and yet\nstill think they can be with the team\non a daily basis? It just doesn\u2019t sound\nquite right.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 I think\nsome of the stuff Pietersen did was\nunacceptable. The \u201ctextgate\u201d scandal\nwill always stick in the throat. But we\nare talking about one of England\u2019s\ngreatest ever batsmen. And an\nEngland team at the moment that\nis currently floundering, unable to\nbeat a West Indies team (one that was\nstripped bare of their top players, who\nare playing in the IPL).\nIf it were me I\u2019d have said that at\nthe moment the middle order is the\nonly part of the team that\u2019s working,\nand as a result currently there is no\nplace for Pietersen. But I certainly\nwouldn\u2019t rule anything out. I would\nhave also said he needs to continue\ngetting runs.\nThere\u2019s a difference between\nthat (which shows that you\u2019re still\ninterested and weren\u2019t lying about it\nearlier in the season) and closing the\ndoor on someone who could still be\nvaluable to this England squad.\nAs it stands I don\u2019t think he can\nplay for the country again. It would\nneed the board to swallow too much\npride.\nAnd so to crucial test series against\nNew Zealand and Australia.\nIt\u2019s seven tests to save Alistair\nCook\u2019s captaincy. It\u2019s seven tests\nfor Andrew Strauss to show that he\nmeans business.\nUnfortunately I can\u2019t see either\nhappening, and we could be in for a\nlong and difficult summer.\nAt least our players trust each other.\nI just hope there\u2019s not a sponsor\u2019s\nfunction they\u2019re expected to attend.\nOr an Ashes series to win.\nKevin Pietersen walks off the Oval pitch after scoring a career high 355 Photo: Getty Images\n\n"

    "content": "THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON 39\n22.05.2015\nFELIX\nC & S Editor Ben Howitt\nClubs and Societies\nfelix.clubsandsocieties@imperial.ac.uk\nAlhasan Al-Habib reviews Dramsoc\u2019s latest production\nThe Shape of the American midwest\nAdam (Sid Sinha) is an insecure\nstudent working part-time\nas a museum security guard,\nwhere he meets anarchistic Art\nstudent Evelyn (Lucy Luo). After\narguing, they begin dating and he\nintroduces his best friends, Jenny\n(Emmie de Falbe) and Phillip (Joshua\nJacob) to her. As their relationship\nprogresses, Adam\u2019s behaviour changes\nand his appearance and confidence\nimprove due to the influences of\nEvelyn, a transition that does not go\nunnoticed. He is soon unrecognisable,\nbut when Evelyn presents her thesis\nfor her Master\u2019s degree, Adam meets\nwith a shocking revelation.\nThe Shape of Things (directed\nby Holly Avins, produced by Peter\nGriffin) doesn\u2019t require much in\nthe way of a set, so Sherfield is an\nadequate venue, and the climax\noccurring in a lecture theatre justifies\nthis unorthodox choice of space.\nSinha gives Adam the \u201cbumbling\nfool\u201d treatment, his nervousness\ntranslating into a sort of awkward\nhumour and wit \u00e0 la Hugh\nGrant. With good direction this\ntranslates into a powerful and\nmeaningful contrast with the\notherwise charismatic, controlling\nand manipulative Evelyn. His\nperformance does occasionally suffer\nfor being slightly forced, however.\nActing nervously in a way that\nseems genuine is difficult, and Sid\u2019s\nperformance becomes slightly clumsy\nwhen he is asked to do so. Lines\noccasionally seem over-rehearsed, but\nhis overall performance is very good\nso this can easily be overseen. \u201cI smell\ntrouble,\u201d declares Adam, \u201cwhich I\nmight not be able to after this,\u201d before\nundergoing cosmetic nasal surgery.\nIt\u2019s a line typical of the seriocomic\nnature of the character, and Sid\ndelivers it with aplomb.\nOne of the reasons Luo\u2019s portrayal\nof Evelyn works is because of its sharp\ncontrast with Sinha\u2019s Adam. Where\nAdam is funny and charming, Evelyn\nis aggressive and spiteful; where\nAdam is na\u00efve and affectionate,\nEvelyn is calculated and domineering.\nShe may have a tiny frame but,\nboosted by her ego, it seems the other\ncharacters can only look up to her.\nAt times Evelyn smoulders, Luo\nproducing an authentic seduction\nof Adam that remains delicate and\nsubtle. \u201cYou\u2019re cute, I don\u2019t like the\nway you style your hair\u201d. She judges\nhim the same way she judges the\nstatue in the opening scene, and it sets\nthe play up well. This play depends\non a good actress for Evelyn, so the\nproduction is lucky to have Luo.\nJacob\u2019s depiction of Phillip was\nexcellent. It is unerring in its realism.\nA lot of the comedy within the play\ndepends on the perfect execution\nand delivery of his lines, often in\nconfrontation, and here Josh delivers\nthe goods with poise, timing and\nall the finesse one might expect of\na professional. As such, a clearly\nnoticeable instance of forgetting\nhis lines during the confrontation\nwith Adam is easily overlooked, if\na little unsettling. But he contorts\nevery sinew of his face to express the\ncontempt he has for Evelyn, and his\naccent never drops for even the most\npoignant of lines. He can be proud of\nhis performance.\nDe Falbe, a newcomer to DramSoc,\nenjoys a good introduction to the\nStage. She delivers a convincing\nportrayal of Jenny, whose purpose\nis to provide the direct antithesis of\nEvelyn; the contrast in this play is\nsevere, and serves its purpose well.\nSo it\u2019s a shame that her delivery of\nmany lines rarely deviates from the\nmonotonous and flat. At one point,\nafter kissing Adam whilst being\nengaged to his best friend, she states\n(and states is exactly what she does)\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do that for a very long\ntime\u201d. It\u2019s a sentence that\u2019s meant to\nbe overflowing with deep, suppressed\nemotion, uncorked by a sudden\nrush of anxiety and fear in the face\nof the terrifying dilemma she faces.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s delivered the same\nway one might deliver a Domino\u2019s\nPizza, that is to say promptly and\nefficiently but without much in the\nway of craftsmanship or finesse. This\nexample typifies a performance where\nthe verbal lags behind a very good\nnon-verbal performance. Regardless,\nshe matures and improves as the play\nprogresses.

Of the worm,\nDr David Slawson, director of\nOPAL, said, \u201cIt is more prevalent in\nNorthern Ireland and Scotland than\nit is in England and Wales.\n\u201cGenerally, most of the pests and\ndiseases tend to come into South-East\nEngland and spread northwards.\nHere\u2019s one that might be moving in\nthe opposite direction.\u201d\nAlys Fowler, who is a gardening\ncolumnist for the Guardian, said of the\nproject \u201cOPAL is a great way to find\nout about the nature right on your\ndoorstep \u2013 wherever you live in the\nUK.\t\t\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get started; you\ndon\u2019t need any previous knowledge\nor experience and it doesn\u2019t matter if\nyou live in the countryside or a city.\nBest of all, OPAL resources are free\nand available to download from www.\nopalexplorenature.org right now, so\nyou don\u2019t have any excuses not to get\ninvolved!\u201d\nOver the last eight years OPAL has\nconducted surveys on topics ranging\nfrom earthworms to air pollution.\nThey also have completed surveys on\nwater and biodiversity (in 2010), and\nclimate and bug counts in 2011.\nDr Slawson said, \u201cThis really does\nincrease the number of observations\nthat experts alone would not be able\nto make.\n\u201cWe designed the surveys very\ncarefully, and we did not ask people to\ndo anything that was too complicated.\n\u201cFor example, when it came to the\ntree health survey, we asked people\nto identify insect pests (not fungal\ninfections) which are easy to identify.\n\u201cThis offers reassurance about data\naccuracy.\u201d\nFive Imperial researchers\nelected Academy Fellows\nFive researchers from Imperial\nCollege London have been\nelected to the Fellowship of\nthe Academy of Medical Sciences in\nrecognition of their work in medical\nscience.\nProfessors Wendy Atkin, Christl\nDonnelly, Jorge Ferrer, Michael Way\nand Martin Wilkins will join 39 other\nnew Fellows to be formally admitted\nin a ceremony this July 2015.\nAcademy Fellows are recognised\nfor excellence in medical research,\nand in particular for their innovative\napplication of scientific knowledge, or\nservice to healthcare that is perceived\nas significant.\nProfessor Wendy Atkin specialises\nin Gastrointestinal Epidemiology\nin the Department of Surgery and\nCancer.

Like rehearsals,\nwhat might feel right today doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily right tomorrow; it\u2019s kind\nof evolving \u2013 you have to try and\nwork in places where you have the\nright to change your mind \u2013 without\ndriving people mad, obviously! They\nhave deadlines. So, mostly those\nare the kind of places I work, and I\nconsider that my job \u2013 to find those\nplaces and make myself work within\nthem \u2013 because that\u2019s the kind of\nwork I want to do.\nFor that reason I\u2019ve pretty\nmuch given up on doing opera,\nbecause opera needs to have all its\ninformation at a certain time which\nis long before you start rehearsal. I\ncan do it, I have done it, and I\u2019ve had\nsome great times, but essentially\nwhat excites me most at the moment\nis doing new work where you sort of\ndon\u2019t know what it is. You work on\nit, and then there\u2019s an audience, and\nthe audience sort of tells you what it\nis and then you have a week to make\nit better. It\u2019s exciting to be working\nwith your colleagues not knowing,\nand to have one of those people be\nthe writer sitting alongside you in the\nspirit of not knowing. At the moment\nthat\u2019s my favourite thing. Carol Ann\nis very much an open person, and I\nthink she enjoyed being with other\npeople. I imagine that writing can\nbe quite isolated \u2013 designing can be\nquite isolated too \u2013 so sharing your\nproblems with your colleagues was\ndelightful.\nJS: Definitely. Are you working on\nanything new at the moment?\nIM: I\u2019m in a similar situation, doing\nMedea [at the Almeida Theatre] \u2013 a\nknown, classic text, but it\u2019s been\nadapted by Rachel Cusk, who is a\nfeminist journalist and writer. It\u2019s a\ngreat idea having her do it, because\nshe has written in a very forthright\nway about the mixed feelings around\nbeing cast in the role of a mother \u2013\nnot being cast in the role of a mother\nby her children, but by the culture.\nShe\u2019s written really well about it, and\nthe way the culture has an opinion\non the way a woman might now be\nperceived now that she is a mother.\nShe\u2019s fascinating on it, and she\u2019s also\nwritten about separation and divorce.\nHer Medea is a really out-there\nversion of it which pulls no punches\nand is kinda great. It tells you Medea\u2019s\nsituation is not specific to any period\nof time, it\u2019s going on around you now.\nJS: Brilliant. Do you have a\nfavourite show you\u2019ve worked on?\nIM: I did a production of An Inspector\nCalls which is now very famous, it\u2019s\nover twenty years old and it\u2019s still\nrunning. I feel great about that,\nbecause it was a particular time where\neverything came together, in a way\nthat you hope for but is very hard to\nachieve. So if I was only allowed to\npoint to one show, I\u2019d probably point\nto that.\nJS: Have you had a most\nchallenging show to work on?\nIM: I did Billy Elliot, and that\u2019s a big\nsuccess, but when you\u2019re doing it, it\ncertainly doesn\u2019t feel like that. New\nmusicals, even with an experienced\nstory, which that is, are a hell of a job.\nI\u2019d not done a musical before, even\nthough I quite liked them, and I was\nwith a lot of people who had also not\ndone a musical before. New musicals\nare difficult, they\u2019re extraordinarily\ndifficult, and you\u2019re trying to make\na machine that delivers pleasure to\nan audience. Moment to moment,\nthat\u2019s very, very precarious. The thing\nthat is assured \u2013 that you\u2019re trying\nto create something that gives an\naudience emotional reassurance \u2013 just\nfeels confident as a piece of theatre.\nThat\u2019s an extraordinarily hard thing\nto do, the components can run away\nfrom you so easily.\nThe pitfalls of naff are monumental,\nthe terrain is just loaded with\nminefields. It\u2019s a big hit now, and it\u2019s\ndone ten years, and I\u2019m proud of my\npart in that; but when you\u2019re doing it\nfor nigh-on two years, which we were,\nit sure as hell doesn\u2019t feel like it. It\u2019s\nmore like a battle. With yourself, with\nthe material, with each other, there\u2019s\nnothing like it. That would be the\nmost challenging, I think, that I\u2019ve\never done.\nJS: It\u2019s a fantastic show, I love it.\nI\u2019ve got one more question \u2013 any\nrecent shows that you\u2019ve seen, that\nyou\u2019ve particularly enjoyed?\nIM: I go on and on about A View from\nthe Bridge, Ivo van Hove \u2013 did you\nsee it?\nJS: Yeah, I managed to catch it just\nbefore it closed.\nIM: I thought it was magical. You\nsaw things that were not there,\nit was so confident and every\ncomponent about it was strong\nand yet it moment-to-moment felt\nbreathtakingly audacious. So to be\nstrong and audacious all the same\ntime, and sort of not have a set, how\ngreat is that? It was thrilling.\nJS: It paid off in spades, I think.\nIM: It did, but it\u2019s interesting, I think,\nbecause those two \u2013 that director and\nthat designer \u2013 they did Antigone at\nthe Barbican, did you see that? Did\nyou think it worked?\nJS: I thought it worked pretty well,\nI was entranced for a lot of it.\nIM: I was very glad I saw it, but it\ndidn\u2019t feel inevitable and assured in\nthe way that A View from the Bridge\ndid. So it made me respect that even\nmore, because I realised how difficult\nand precarious that was. Whereas\nwhen you were watching Antigone\nyou experience the kind of doubt, you\njust saw how difficult a thing it is to\ndo. They made it look easy on A View\nfrom the Bridge. Antigone makes you\nrealise it\u2019s not at all easy, which made\nme respect them even more.\nIan\u2019s next show, Medea, opens at the\nAlmeida from 25th\nSeptember. Directed\nby Rupert Goold and written by Rachel\nCusk.\n\"What\nexcites me\nis doing new\nwork where\nyou sort of\ndon\u2019t know\nwhat it is\"\n\"Rachel\nCusk\u2019s\nMedea is\na really\nout-there\nversion\nwhich pulls\nno punches\"\nKate Fleetwood will take on the title role in the Almeida\u2019s version of Medea this summer Photo: Almeida Theatre\nthe set Photo: Richard Hubert Smith/National Theatre\n\n"

In an interview\nwith Felix, he discussed the practical\napplications of his research, which\ninvolves the use of Attenuated Total\nReflectance Fourier Transform\nInfrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.\nHe described the ability of this\ntechnology to reveal \u201cwhat the eye\ncannot see\u201d.\nProfessor Kazarian described the\nnew imaging method as a form of\n\u201cChemical Photography\u201d which relies\non the vibrations of chemical bonds\nand Beer\u2019s Law, allowing scientists\nto determine the concentration\ndistribution of proteins, lipids and\nchemicals in human tissue. This is\nparticularly useful in analysing how\ndrug tablets diffuse in the body.\nIn the past, pharmaceutical\ncompanies have had to rely on\ntrial and error to determine the\nright compositions. The industry is\nalready using this new imagining\nmethod to enhance the efficiency of\ntheir products by allowing them to\npredict analytically how unknown\ncompositions behave in the body.\nThis technology has further\napplications in forensic science.\nProfessor Kazarian \u2013 a Sherlock\nHolmes fan \u2013 was thrilled to see that\nhis research is currently being used\nby the Home Office to investigate\ncrime scenes. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy\nallows detectives to predict the age\nof a fingerprint, and the sex of the\nperson who left it, by analysing the\nchemicals present.\nProfessor Elaine Holmes received\nthis year\u2019s Royal Society of Chemistry\nInterdisciplinary Award. Her research\nconcerns the chemical mapping of\nbiological samples. Human cells\ncontain thousands of chemicals and\nhave many different concentration\nprofiles. Any changes to those profiles\nreflects a change of the environment\nor the health of the subject.\nProfessor Holmes\u2019 complex\nmodelling of chemicals in the human\nbody has lead to a completely new\nfield of statistics within the biological\nframework of the human body.

Last year saw Yael\nFarber direct a production of The\nCrucible, staged in the round at\nthe Old Vic and starring Richard\nArmitage; Ivo Van Hoe brought A\nView from the Bridge back to life in a\nstartlingly minimalist production\nthat moved from the Young Vic to\nthe Wyndham\u2019s Theatre for early\n2015; this year, a touring production\nof All My Sons featuring an all-black\ncast made the rounds, while the RSC\nopened a revival of Miller\u2019s most\nenduringly acclaimed piece, Death of\na Salesman, at the Royal Shakespeare\nTheatre in Stratford-upon-Avon.\nThat production now transfers to the\nNoel Coward Theatre in the West\nEnd proper (replacing Shakespeare in\nLove) for a ten-week run.\nThe first thing that \u2013 naturally \u2013\ncatches your eye when entering the\ntheatre is the set. The interior of a\ntwo-storey house squats centre stage,\nthe beams supporting the ground\nfloor visible, as if the whole house had\nbeen cut in two. Small and compact,\nthe house is overshadowed by the vast\nnumber of identical dwellings that\nloom over it in an imposing tableau.\nRows and rows of terraced flats\ndefine the sides and rear of the stage,\nsome with lights shining through\ntheir windows, suggesting a scale far\nbeyond the one measly house we have\nbeen granted access to.\nThere are moments where it can\nfeel like this is a show that has been\nscaled up for a full-blown West End\nstage \u2013 the decision to use gauze and\nwhat appears to be projection, to\nallow the backdrop to subtly shift in\nappearance during certain scenes,\ninevitably leads to moments where\nthe entire thing becomes almost\ntransparent, but it\u2019s a forgivable (and\nunderstandable) sin. Yes, you can\noccasionally see the construction\nholding up the structure, but the\nplay does such a magnificent job of\nfocusing your attention on the actors\u2019\nperformances that\u2019s it hard to mind\ntoo much.\nThe discussion of staging proves\ninteresting in the context of the\ntwo other West End productions\nof Miller\u2019s plays: The Crucible\u2019s set\nwas sparse, enough to evoke the\nsetting and little more, and being\nin the round meant the actors\u2019\nperformances were being viewed\nfrom all angles; A View from the Bridge\nwent even further, dropping almost\nall set entirely in favour of a knee-high glass bench, with audience on\nthree sides. No props beyond a pair of\nshoes, and yet still utterly absorbing.\nBy comparison, this production of\nDeath of a Salesman is an incredibly\nstraight-forward affair. Where this\nshow gets interesting is the text itself.\nThe story is that of Willy Loman,\na down-on-his-luck, exhausted\nsalesman. Returning home from\nan abortive sales trip following a\nnear-miss car accident, he discovers\nhis estranged, unsuccessful sons have\nboth come to stay, reuniting their old\nfamily unit.\nAs Willy\u2019s mind wanders, he begins\nto talk to himself, often flashing back\nto moments in his sons\u2019 childhoods,\nwhen the world lay at their feet and\nsuccess seemed certain. It\u2019s in these\nflashbacks that the play is allowed\nto quietly tug at the rug beneath the\naudience\u2019s feet, as subtle (and the\nodd unsubtle) lighting changes fire\noff, and the invisible boundaries\nof the house \u2013 almost all of them\nimaginary, and defined solely by the\nactors\u2019 performances, never noticed\nor remarked upon until now \u2013 are\nignored and trampled all over.\nThose flashbacks in particular\ndemand an incredibly strong presence\non stage to pull off successfully. The\nlines between reality and the world\ninside Willy\u2019s head grow increasingly\nblurry throughout the play, leading\nwith a dread inevitability towards the\ntitular conclusion, and it\u2019s to Antony\nSher\u2019s immense credit that he pulls\nthe whole thing off magnificently.\nIt\u2019s a towering performance that\nrules the stage, as he inhabits the\ntortured, exhausted, lost Willy. His\naccent initially grates, pushing us\naway from the character, but over\ntime it serves as another aspect to\nWilly\u2019s personality, combining his\ndesperate need to be \u201cwell-liked\u201d with\nhis constant pushing away of those\naround him through his actions and\nfailings.\nIt\u2019s a fine line between feeling\nempathy with Willy, understanding\nhis struggles, and just feeling sorry\nfor him, which this production\noccasionally strays over, before\nimmediately course-correcting. It\u2019s\nan intense effort by the cast, who\nwithout exception put in excellent\nperformances, not least Alex Hassell\nand Sam Marks as Willy\u2019s sons Biff\nand Happy. Asked to play grown\nmen one minute, then teenage boys\nthe next, they are given the greatest\nchallenge after Sher, and both tackle\nit excellently. Hassell\u2019s performance\nis heart-wrenching in the play\u2019s\nclosing moments, as he desperately\nattempts to break through Willy\u2019s\nself-delusions and show him the\ntruth.\nIn fact, it\u2019s the play\u2019s closing\nmoments where everything, across\nthe board, comes together to\ndeliver something truly great. This\nproduction is long, at two and a half\nhours (not including the interval)\n\u2013 not nearly as long as The Crucible,\nwhich clocked in over three hours, but\nnot as snappy as the one-act A View\nfrom the Bridge \u2013 and the struggle to\nmaintain the tension, the intensity\nof emotion that the play demands\nstarts to become too much as the end\napproaches.\nBut then, as Biff confronts his\nfather one last time, everything\nabruptly falls into place. The use of\na live band, which until this point\nfeels significantly under-used, is fully\njustified by the trembling, painfully\nhigh note that lingers uncomfortably\nin the air as Willy makes his final\ndecision. The lighting is perfect, the\nperformances are perfect, everything\njust works. It\u2019s a gut-wrenching\nmoment \u2013 telegraphed by the title,\nbut still hitting hard.\nIt takes a long time to reach that\npoint, and while this production is\nnever bad \u2013 or even adequate, it\u2019s\nalways good \u2013 it never quite hits\ngreatness until the big finish. But\nwhen it gets there, it explodes, and\nhovers in the memory for hours, days\nafterwards.\nThis is the play that mostly\nimpresses, rather than awes, at first\nsight, but sticks with you long after\nthe curtain falls. And that, more than\nanything else, deserves applause.\nDeath of a Salesman is on at the No\u00ebl\nCoward Theatre until 18th\nJuly. Tickets\nfrom \u00a310, available online.\n\n"

His books were taken\naway and have not been returned\nto him, and he was left without his\ntent and sleeping bag overnight\nbefore they were returned to him the\nfollowing morning.\nThe alleyway is property of TfL,\nand although those who work at the\nstation have told police he is welcome\nto stay, residents of the properties\noverlooking the alleyway are not so\nhappy about Mark setting up camp\nthere.\nA BBC report covering Mark\nfeatured an interview with Audrey,\nwho was scared Mark would climb\nover into the garden: \u201cI don\u2019t think\nanyone would be happy with someone\nat their back door... It\u2019s very insecure.\u201d\nSome of the residents have been\nrepeatedly reporting Mark to the\npolice as a result, often accusing him\nof anti-social behaviour.\nHowever, Mark said to the BBC: \u201cI\nthink it\u2019s a joke considering I don\u2019t do\nnothing wrong. I sit here and I read\na book I don\u2019t give anyone any grief\nand I make sure I keep the alleyway\nclean.\u201d\nHe also told the Big Issue in an\ninterview published this week: \u201cI\nthink a certain neighbour was saying\nI\u2019m causing problems, but everyone\nround here knows I\u2019m not doing that.\nI collect up all my stuff and don\u2019t\nleave any rubbish. When the police\ntook me away they asked if those were\nmy books. I said, \u2018Well, no \u2013 they\u2019re\nfor everyone.\u2019 So I suppose they didn\u2019t\nconsider them my belongings.\u201d\nMark has been told now that if he\nstays in the alleyway longer than four\nhours, he will be arrested.\nA quiet demonstration, featuring\nseveral students and friends of Farah,\ntook place on Wednesday after Mark\nwas told to move to show support\nfor Mark. Their peaceful protest also\nmade it onto the BBC news, and even\nattracted support from local celebrity\nJamie Lang, a star from the reality\ntelevision program Made In Chelsea.\nJamie told the BBC: \u201cIf he\u2019s not\nharassing the local community -which Mark wasn\u2019t at all - then why\nkick him out if he\u2019s not abusing\nanyone? There\u2019s just no need for it.\u201d\nMark is still in the area, but,\nwithout a spot to make camp, he also\ndoesn\u2019t have a spot to keep his books.\nFarah hosts a Facebook page for\nMark, and posted to see if anyone in\nthe area knows of a secure location he\ncan set up a new library.\nThe page has nearly 900 likes and is\ninundated with comments showing\nsupport for Mark. One poster recently\ncommented: \u201cMark is one of the\nnicest people I\u2019ve met in Parsons\nGreen! I\u2019m a local resident and really\nenjoy chatting with him.\n\u201cThe builders who gather there\nare the real problem; urinating and\ndrinking etc. One time, a terrible\nfight broke out and I felt so scared as\nthey were all huge men, very drunk\nand I got stuck trying to walk past\nthem.\n\u201cThankfully, Mark was quietly\nreading and I knew if something\nterrible had happened he\u2019d have\nhelped me.\u201d\nFarah now plans to raise enough\nmoney to buy Mark a van, in which he\ncan live, read and hopefully sell books\nfrom in the future. Mark also hopes to\nuse the van to travel to other areas of\nLondon to provide vital support for\nthose that are also sleeping rough by\ntalking to them, encouraging them to\nread and highlighting the problems of\nbeing homeless.\nMark, who was born in\nHammersmith, has been homeless\nfor three years. After spending some\ntime in Chiswick, he settled into\nthe alleyway behind Parsons Green\nand has been happily camping and\nreading there for nearly a year.\nFarah concluded: \u201cSome people\nhave asked me why I am only helping\none homeless person, and say \u201c \u201cWell,\nthere are lots of homeless people in\nLondon, why are you not helping\nthose too?\u201d\n\u201cObviously I am aware there are lots\nof homeless people in the city, but I\nam only one person and can only do\nso much.\n\u201cHopefully by sharing Mark\u2019s\nreviews and presenting maybe this\nother side to him that people may not\nsee, I can challenge preconceptions\npeople may have about the homeless\nand raise awareness of the problems a\nlot of homeless people face.\u201d\nWant to contribute or know more?\nVisit Mark\u2019s Facebook page (The\nHomeless Book Critic) for the blog.\nMark Burns has been warned to move on from his regular reading spot or face jail time.
