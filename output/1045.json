    "content": "interview: shed sevens; singles:* You'v enc\nth\niy,\ntes\nmM hi.\nIt's not every day that a major record company\npays for your humble Felix music reviewer to go\nto Leeds, eat at the Hilton, interview a band, go\nto a secret gig, stay overnight in a hotel and then\ncome back to London. So what was the occ a sion? Well, York's finest, Shed Seven, are about\nto release their hugely anticipated second album.\nThey believe that it will thrill their devotees and\nastound everyone who hears it. Obviously,\nPolydor Records thinks so too. I travelled up to\nLeeds to meet the band and to see if they could\njustify these presumptuous claims...\nI caught the train to Leeds and checked into\nmy hotel room by 5 p.m. I then headed for the\nplush surroundings of the Hilton Hotel and, after\na few drinks at the bar and a nice, juicy steak for\ndinner (all free, of course), it was time to speak to\nShed Seven vocalist, Rick Witter, and drummer,\nAlan Leach...\nThe interview takes place in their hotel room,\nwith Rick sitting on a sofa, his expression quite\nserious and even contemplative, and Alan seeming less introspective,\nwith an ever present\ngrin across his lace.\nThey've just got back fj: from their first tour ol\nAmerica and from <\n\u00a3\n>\n_\n,\ntouring Europe with I^^^B i^^^P Echobelly, but as they <\nexplained, they\nenjoyed gigging in the\nFar Last the most.\n\"In Thailand and | mj fl HH HH H Japan we got gifts from \u2022 HH H fans. In Japan, some of Bh HH HH HH HH the fans actually had gf J B(B(B Hfl HH breakdowns at the\ngigs. There was never\nany stage-diving but the atmosphere was so\nintense.\"\nRick continued: \"I also got my first black eye\nafter a gig when a girl threw a new watch in its\ncase through the open window of our car.\"\nNot that all touring is as agreeable to them.\nThe subject of festivals brings back unpleasant\nmemories, as does the subject of Oasis. Rick is\nonly willing to say one sentence on the matter:\n\"We did a headline gig with them in London\nonce but they were too arse y.\" He goes on to claim that it was Shed Seven\nwho invented Britpop and that he doesn't like\nbands just because they are part of a scene. Of the\nup and corning bands of the moment, he mentions Cast with respect.\nWe move on to talk of the new album, which\nis due out in March. Rick had already commented in print that 'We couldn't be arse d with all that\n'difficult second album' b***** ks, so we've gone\nstraight on to our third.\" He is a little more specific here:\n\"It is similar to 'Changegiver' [their successful debut album] but with more instruments and\na better recording so that it's more in yer face. If\nyou go into a club and hear 'Dolphin' come on\nalter Primal Scream's 'Rocks', it sounds tinny\nand weak.\"\nlater that night, the\n\u2022 fc v\\, Sheds play a secret gig\nHH HH H| at Brighton Beach, a mod hangout in Leeds.\nWjk 5S&'/ They kick off their set\nBt * *l with the new single,\nI*<785S S*'' Getting Better', and\n\u2022 play their five other st nw kg les to date, before\nending with the\nimpressive epic,\n'Parallel Hnes'. The\natmosphere is electrifying and the energy Rick\ngenerates with his passionate vocals seethes with\nintensity.\nThe night finishes and we're left eagerly\nawaiting the new album.

    "content": "two . Felix Friday January I2t h1996 News News in brief\nBMS planning\ndifficulties\nRCS II still not demolished BY MARK BRIDGE\nPermission has still not been\ngranted for the College to\ndemolish the RCS II building\nwhich lies behind the Chemistry\nBuilding and is currently being\nprepared for demolition.\nThe location is a critical part\nof the Basic Medical Sciences\nBuilding programme. College is\nbelieved to have submitted a planning application in early\nOctober last year, well in time\nfor Schal, the College's construction contractors, to begin demolition a few weeks from now.\nHowever processing the application has taken far longer than the\nexpected six to eight weeks and\nhas yet to even reach the agenda\nof the Borough Planning\nCommittee. Planning permission\nis only considered after the\nBorough checks that laws which\nit has a responsibility to maintain\nare not broken.\nThe College has a history of\ndifficulties in carrying through its\nestates' plans. In recent years\nthere have been complaints from\nlocal residents vehemently\nopposed to plans for the construction of additional floors on\ntop of the Sports Centre. Last\nyear's centralisation effort, planning to transfer the Students'\nUnion to the Sherfield Building,\nhad to be dropped after intense\nlobbying by the Union and stu-dents.\nThe Borough's primary\nresponsibility is to ensure that\nsafe and healthy environments\nare maintained in and around\nbuildings, and it has statutory\npowers to enforce the provisions\nof the Building Act (1984) and\nthe Building Regulations (1991).\nIt considers factors such as the\nhistory of a site, appeals decisions, Central Government gui d ance, and local representations in\ndetermining whether or not to\ngrant permission for develop-ment s. The College's Planning\nDepartment could not comment\nat all on the development, referring all questions to the Estates\nManagement Department, who\nhave assumed responsibility for\nthe project. Unfortunately Mr Caldwell, the Estates director\nand official spokesperson, was\nunavailable at the time of going\nto press, hence the College's position is unclear.\nLondon has been subject to\nbuilding control since the twelfth\ncentury. The system was\nenhanced after the rebuilding\nfollowing the 1666 Great Fire of\nLondon and continued through\nmany revisions of legislation\nwhich culminated in the London\nBuilding Acts of the 1930's. These Acts and the associated\nBy-Laws were administered by\nthe District Surveyors and continued until 1986 when most of\ntheir provisions were repealed\nand replaced by the 1984\nBuilding Act and associated\nBuilding Regulations. Certain\nparts of the London Building\nActs still remain in force though,\nand apply in addition to the\nBuilding Regulations.\nStudent leaders of the medical schools that will make up the\nnew centre are continuing to\nexpress concern over the lack of\nsocial facilities in the new build-ing. Their opinions are being considered by the BMS steering\ncommittee, where they are represented by ICU President Sarah\nWhite, but it is thought to be\nunlikely that any new space will\nbe made available. The demand\nfor space in the building is so\ntight that the entire structure\nwould have to be redesigned to\nmake more room available.\nBY ALEX FEAKES\nAND BEN WILKINS\nIC's University\nChallenge\nImperial College Union has\ngot through to the second round\nin the television quiz show\nUniversity Challenge which pits\nteams from Universities around\nthe country in competition testing their general and specialised\nknowledge. After a slow start,\nwhich the ICU president\ndescribed as 'nerve w racking', the\nteam pulled through and beat St.\nAndrew's convincingly.\nNewspaper service\nends\nDa Vinci's Catering\nDepartment have written to\nFelix to explain the situation\nregarding the issue of free newspapers for the use of our cus-to mers. The service is provided\nat a cost of \u00a366 per month and\nunfortunately due to the lack of\nconsideration of some customers\nDa Vinci's are no longer prepared to provide it.\nThey realise that the majority of customers appreciate the\nservice and treat it with respect\nbut a minority continue to abuse\nit, stealing the papers, tearing\nthem up and generally trashing\nthem. Out of principle and with\napologies to our loyal customers\nDa Vinci's have decided to end\nthe service.\nGraduation joy\nThe time when graduating\nmeant sitting through thousands\nof diplomas being awarded is no\nlonger. From this year, there are\nto be two ceremonies, one in\nJune and the other in November.\nNot enough science\njobs\nThe United Kingdom is not\nemploying enough science and\ntechnology graduates in research\nand development, according to a report by the Institute of\nEmployment Studies.\nOnly 4.5 people are\nemployed as researchers per\n1000 of the labour force in the\nUK. This compares with 5.3 in\nFrance, 6 in Germany and 6.9 in\nthe US. The report says that\nthere is little sign of a strong\ndemand for new science graduates and students may be voting\nwith their feet by not choosing to\nstudy science.\nRichard Pearson, the author\nof the report, commented that\neven if there was a20% increase\nin the number of science jobs\novernight, then the supply of\nnew graduates would not be a problem.\nEarth gallery opening\nThe new Earth Galleries at\nthe Natural History museum will\nbe opening this summer. The\ndevelopment will cost \u00a312million, half of which will come\nfrom the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nWhen completed, the the building will have three floors of high-tech 'earth based exhibitions.\nVisitors will enter through an\natrium featuring a giant revolving\nglobe.\nSchal's going all one\nway\nThe more awake among the\nregular cyclists to union may\nhave noticed that a one way system has been set up around\nunion by the Basic Medical\nScience contractors, Schal\nInternational. The system will\nhopefully regulate the increased\ntraffic flow due to the construction of the new building.\nIC Professor knighted\nRobert May, visiting professor at IC and chief scientific\nadvisor, received a knighthood in\nthis years honours list.\nSir Robert's career has been\nvery diverse so far, he started as\na chemical engineer, worked in\nphysics and then crossed over to\nbiology. In 1973 he made a major\ncontribution to ecology when he\npublished a paper in which he\nused ideas from chaos theory to\nmodel ecosystems.\n\n"

Felix Friday January 1 2th1996 Sport\nFELIX SPORT\nGirlies Victorious\nIn Footballing\nBattle of The Sexes\nTouche!\nIC MEN1217 IC WOMEN From the outset it was obvious\nthat the world-renowned\nI CW AFC were going to dominate play.\nAt 9pm on Saturday evening\nwhen the game kicked off, the\nladies somewhat outnumbered\nthe gentlemen. In response to\nthis, Nigel Helmsley, the flamboyant captain of ICA FC signaled to his boys to cower in the\ncorner and play a defensive game.\nUnluckily, even with all the\nmen's best players present and\nplaying their hardest, they were\nno match for the agile and devious ladies, who before the main\ncourse had been served had managed to send the boys huddling\ntogether protectively. During the\ndessert it was thought for a few\nmoments that they were going to\npull their game together as several members of the men's club\nstarted to come out of the\ncocoon they had created. But all\ntheir efforts proved fruitless, as\nat the end of the night the score\nremained at 17 - 12. Yet another\nresounding victory for the IC\nLadies Football Club.\nThis year's individual BUS A fencing championships took\nplace at Cardiff University, to\nwhich Imperial College sent a strong team, with good chances\nin all three events (e pee, foil and\nsabre).\nIn the first, the e pee, the\nmen's event was entered by\nReuben Kalam and Eddie\nRysdale. Both fenced well to\nreach the last 32. In the\nwomen's event though, Liz\nKipling's lack of competition\npractice showed when the seeded player, was edged into third\nplace on the last hit of her semi\nfinal.\nAfter the foil seeding\nrounds, three IC fencers (Nick\nManton, Alex Davies and Eddie\nRysdale) had dropped only nineteen hits between them, with\nCharles Cooper not far behind.\nThis resulted in LI6 places for\nCharles and Alex, and a place in\nthe last eight for Eddie.\nIC's best results came on\nthe last day, the sabre com pet i tion, where all the team made\nthe last sixteen. Charles and\nShafik Saba were unlucky\nenough to draw each other in the\nquarter finals, but Shafik, a GBR national squad member, went\nthrough to take the title on the\nlast hit in the final.\nWE NEED GOLFERS! Imperial College Golf Team has\nreached the second round of the\nBUSA National Championship\ndespite the seemingly major\nproblem of it's non-existence.\nWe at Felix believe our passing\nof the first hurdle was by\ndefault, but perhaps not. Who\nknows? Anyway, if your game is\nup to it, get in touch with Tim\nTownend and you might well get\na representative game.\nSailors\nMake\nSunsail\nFinals\nLate November saw seven IC\nstudents achieve what many\nbefore have failed to do: qualify\nfor the Sunsail Regatta finals.\nThe team settled down\nquickly and gained easy fourth\nand second positions in races\none and two on the Saturday.\nSunday saw clear skies, perfect\nwind and an overall second\nplace on which to hold. Some\nserious spinnaker mishandling\nled to a miserable eighth in the\nthird race; the final leg though,\nwith IC's final chances slipping\naway, was enough to gain a nail-biting third place, ensuring their\npresence at Port Solent the next\nFriday.\nCoursework and end of\nterm exams put a noticeable\nstrain on selection, and it was a decidedly mixed crew who\nmade the trek to the South\nCoast. In awful conditions only\ntwo races were run over the\nweekend. Despite many of the\ntwenty boats having hefty and\nprominent sponsorship, (the\noverall winners were the team\nfunded by Touche Ross), IC\nmanaged a highly respectable\ntenth place. Well done by all.\nSportsNews\nThe under fire England football\nmanager'Terry Venables has resigned\nfrom his post only months before the\nEuropean Championships.\nHe said \"It's not an easy decision to\ntake, but I have several legal battles to\ncome up, and it would be very very difficult to give a full commitment to the task\nin hand.\" The favourite to be his successor is the current Newcastle boss Kevin\nKeegan,\nFOOTBALL ICAFC 1 2 - 1 7 ICWAFC\nFENCING SHAFIK SABA WON THE BUSA SABRE CHAMPIONSHIPS\nPLEASE REGALE THE SPORTS DESK WITH YOUR RESULTS\nOR EVEN MATCH REPORTS ASAP ON WEDNESDAYS\nIC Athletics Clubs Committee is\nsponsored by\nLAYERS\nCustomized Club Kits and Sports Equipment Specialists\n\n"

The single 'Leave Home' reached an unprecedented\nnumber 17 in the charts and the tour that followed was a sell-out. On top of all that, they continue to be rock's favourite remixer s doing their\nstuff for, amongst others, Primal Scream, Oasis,\nThe Prodigy and Leftfield.\nTonight at the Brixton Academy, they show\nex acd y why they've come so far so soon with a blinder of a set. One of the criticisms of 'Exit\nPlanet Dust' was the duplication of the 'Leave\nHome' formula. No danger of that here. The\nweaker tracks are left out, replaced by an encouragingly original handful of new ones. The only\nshame is that they don't attempt to bring any of\nthe ethereal vocals in 'Alive Alone' or Tim Burgess'\ncontribution to 'life is Sweet' into the mix. All that is dropped in favour of a full-on techno\nonslaught.\nThe Prodigy obviously value the Chemical\nBrothers as a warm-up act since this isn't the first\ntime the two bands have played together. Their\neclectic m ish mash of house, hip-hop, dub and\nindie-rock is perfect for The Prodigy's crowd. By\nthe time the set is wound up with an extended\nmix of the seminal Chemical Beats' (easily their\nbest song to date), there's hardly a dry T shirt or\nun raised arm in the house.\nThe Prodigy's live shows have become near\nlegendary, thanks largely thanks to a string of summer festival appearances including Tribal\nGathering, Glastonbury and T in the Park.\nThey're hardly recognisable as the same teeny\nrave act dismissed by the press as a joke outfit following the chart success of the first single,\nCharly'. The million dollar question is how liam\nand co. are going to follow up their summertime\nsuccess? What new visual extravaganza are they\ngoing to throw at us this time? Well, as it turns out,\nnothing. But that's about the only disappoint-ment.\nFrom the moment they open with an\ninspired, metal guitar- driven version of Their\nLaw' that has most of the crowd head-banging like\nthey were at a Pantera gig, you know that this is\ngoing to be a good one. Keith careers about the\nstage like some wild, demented animal, Leroy\ndoes his usual mad dance routine, and Maxim\noversees the carnage, inciting the crowd to new\nheights of hysteria with his screams of, \"Pay close\nattention,\" and, \"Are you here to rock?\" Oh yeah,\nthis is cheesier than any Van Halen gig.\nMeanwhile, Liam churns out all the classics,\nall but hidden behind a mountain of machinery.\n'Poison' and 'Out of Space' are definite highlights.\nJudging by the number of wide eyed, water bottle clutching n utters around me, there's been\nplenty of the former consumed tonight.\nThis is one of those gigs where you know that\nyou're witnessing a band at the peak of the career,\nwhere you know that this is as good as it's going to\nget - ever. And the crowd love it. The Prodigy in\nfront of their home crowd, winding up their most\nsuccessful year so far to create the kind of unified,\ntriumphant atmosphere that most live acts only\never dream of.\nBrilliant.\n- album: ministry of sound: the annual \u2122 *\nAfter Cream, Hard Times and Up Yer Ronson,\nMinistry of Sound have now released a club cash-in compilation of tracks that were crowd please rs there throughout 1995. This set has been mixed\nby Boy George and Pete Tong. It features The\nBucketheads, Felix and The Original, to name but\na few, but this album is obvious and pretty tedious\nto boot.\nAnd herein lies the problem with this sort of\nrelease: in no way will a dance compilation album\nreplace a night out. If you're under the impression\nthat this will transform your sitting room into a club when you throw a party, then you are sorely\nmistaken.\nSo, an album containing a lot of tracks you\nprobably a kea dy own on Dance Zone level 3, volume 2, '95' but now with added gimmicks. Yes,\na nice imitation leather cover and a free book! If\nthey think they are going to get away with a blatant marketing ploy like the 32 page pamphlet,\nthen they've got another thing coming. The booklet is just full of adverts for various Ministry merchandise and future releases, together with a review of the year. I would have thought that it\nwould have been more useful to list form coming line ups for '96 in ste ead of listing what DJ's played\nwhen and where in '95, but what do I know?\nYour bog-standard club compilation then, but\nif you have half a brain cell then you aren't going\nto be fooled by this at all. Buy the Beano annual\ninstead - it probably contains more information\nthan the booklet and isn't half as expensive.\n(5) for substance, (0) for originality.\n\n"

    "content": "Of Mice, Men and Mad Cows Current work on genetically altered mice may give us a clue to the link between CJD and BSE\nDo mad cows make mad men?\nHow do you prove that BSE\nwill or won't lead to CJD?\nFeeding your daughter beef-burgers doesn't prove that beef is safe,\nand the fact that some dairy farmers\nhave contracted CJD is not evidence\nthat there is a link to BSE.\nIn December last year, Sir Bernard Tomlinson,\nan Oxford neurologist, said that he would not\neat beef because it just wasn't worth taking the\nrisk. This started off the BSE debate once again\nand a spate of stories about the clangers of eating\nbeef hit the press. The latest news is that recent\nresearch at Imperial College indicated that BSE\ncould not cross the species barrier to cause CJ D. The research, headed by Professor John\nCollinge, was published in Nature magazine.\nWhat work has really been carried out and what\ncomfort, if any, can we take from it?\nThe main problem with research into BSE and\nCJD is finding a sensible way to study the possible links. The incubation time of CJ D is sometimes as long as several decades. This is too long\nto wait and see if the incidence of CJ D will\nincrease dramatically amongst the nation's beef\neaters. Humans are not practical subjects for\ninvestigation. Professor Collinge and his team\n(known as the Prion Disease Group) are working on this problem by using mice. The mice\nhave been genetically modified to express\nhuman prion proteins instead of, or as well as,\nmouse prion proteins. Dr Collinge explains\n\"These genetically modified mice now allow us\nto study CJ D in a detailed way that has not been\npossible before.\"\nSo far the Prion Group have given the results\nof two experiments; one with CJ D prions and\nthe other with BSE. In the first experiment, the\nteam injected CJ D prions into four types of\nmice: two having different amounts of human\nprion proteins and two with only mouse prion\nproteins. This way the team could see how\nhuman prion proteins reacted to CJ D prions\nwhen present in mice. They discovered that the\nmore human prions the mice expressed, the\nsooner they developed the disease. The mice\nwith only mouse prion proteins survived around\n200 days longer than the \"human\" mice. This\nexperiment established that there must be a species compatibility for efficient interaction of\nprions with prion proteins.\nThe team then moved onto working with\nBSE. Mice with various mixtures of human and\nmouse prion proteins were injected with cow\nprions. There was no significant difference in\nincubation times for the disease in the mice.\nHowever, when the brain extracts of the mice\nwere examined, only mouse prions were detect-ed. So it would appear that human prion proteins do not interact with cow prions. BSE\nappeared only to cross the species barrier with\nmouse prion proteins and not the human equivalent. BSE has also been injected into mice expressing only human prion proteins. After 268 days\nthe mice are still alive. This does not yet provide\nconclusive evidence that humans will not develop CJD-like diseases from eating infected beef.\nWe must wait for the mice to die of old age (a further 700 days), to be sure that they have not\ncontracted the disease. Even if the mice do not\nfall ill, just one altered gene does not make a mouse human.\nThere may be many more factors at work in\nthe transmission of BSE to humans. \"The current results are certainly not a definitive answer\nwith regard to human risk, nor could they be.\"\nsays Collinge.\nNat Barb\nwhich cause degeneration of the hi\ns but haw twi > important differ m<1 "

    "content": "Feature Felix Friday 1 2th January 1996 . five\nSlavery in Britain in the1990 s\"I will cut your face. I will kill you if you ever disobey an order. You are my slave. You will do exactly what I say; eat only\nwhen I tell you and what I give you. If you attempt to steal food, you will be starved until I decide you have learned your les-son. You will sleep on the floor outside my bedroom and only for the hours I tell you. You will have no days off and you will\nnot leave this house unaccompanied. Remember I hold your passport. If the police find you will be deported to where you\ncome from. And, if you are, you will be killed, if I do not manage to kill you first. Don't forget there are plenty more where\nyou come from.\" Employer to domestic staff\nSlavery was abolished in 1833, yet the quote\nabove was made in Britain a couple of years\nago. Slavery has been quietly re-established in\nBritain legally and with the sanction of the\nBritish government.\nHow is This Happening\nBehind the doors of some of Britain's most\nluxurious residences (many of them not far\nfrom where you are reading this), diplomats,\nVIPs and other outwardly respectable people,\nkeep bonded domestic workers in conditions\nof abject slavery. And it is the UK government which ties them to their employer - for\nany worker considering escape, the sure\nknowledge that they will be deported presents a formidable deterrent. The reason this\nsituation exists is due totally to government\nlegislation and could be ended at a stroke. In\n1979 under Mrs. Thatcher, Britain's immigration laws were tightened (as they have just\nbeen again with equally disastrous consequences for the dispossessed) and Britain\nstopped granting work permits directly to\npersons entering the UK as domestic workers.\nHowever a1980 concession, which the Home\nOffice admits is outside the immigration\nRules, continues to allow employers to bring\ntheir domestic workers into the country as\npersons accompanying a named employer.\nThis means that they must work only for that\nemployer. Thus on the point of entry, the\ndomestic workers are given no independent\nstatus as workers, although they are admitted\ninto this country to work. Instead they are\ntied to their employer and effectively\ndeprived of workers rights, all of which ultimately depend on the right to change employ-Denial of Basic Human Rights\nNo fewer than 4 of the 30 articles in the UN declaration of human rights are contravened\nas a result of the Home Office policy on overseas domestic workers.\nWhat can be done? Kalayaan and AntiSlavery International are both working to win\nback the rights of these overseas domestic\nworkers, and their campaign has cross-party\nsupport in both houses of parliament. Their\nrecommendations to the government are:\n\u2022 That overseas domestic workers should\nhave a status which recognises that they are\nworkers in their own right\n\u2022 That overseas domestic workers be allowed\nto change employers within the same category of employment\n\u2022 That overseas domestic workers who pursue legal action against their former\nemployers have the right to stay and work\nduring the life of the court proceedings\n\u2022 That those overseas domestic workers who\nhave already left their employers and are\nnow overstay ers should have their immigration status regular is ed. The implementation of these recommendations would put an end to the current abuse\nand conditions of slavery, but the government\nhas refused to comply on any of these points.\nThere is growing support amongst the public\nand MPs for Kalayaans case and if you would\nlike to help them you can contact any of the\nfollowing groups, IC Third World First, IC\nLabour Club, Kalayaan (c/o St. Francis\nCentre, Pottery Lane, London, Wl14N Q) or\nAnti-Slavery International (Unit 4, Stableyard\nBroomgrove Rd, London SW 9TL.)

BSE is a member of a group of diseases\nknown as the spongiform\ne ncep halo p athies, or prion dis-eases.

It involves mice genetically\nmodified to have certain types of\nhuman genes. The idea of this\nresearch is to investigate how\nsusceptible mice are to BSE\nwhen they have human genes.\nSo far, although the experiment is not yet complete, the\ngenetically altered mice are\nshowing a resistance to infection\nfrom BSE. Professor Collinge\nsays: \"These results are reassuring so far but it is important to\nunderstand that they are the initial stages in a series of experiments and there is still a long\nway to go with these studies.\"\nProfessor Collinge and his\ngroup also aim to use these\ngenetically modified mice to\nresolve other questions, such as\nto determine whether there are\ndifferent \"strains\" of human pri-ons.\nIn the longer term they hope\nto study potential therapies for\nthe human disease in mice.\nBY THE NEWS TEAM Today Pimlico, tomorrow the\nworld...

Maybe there is an alternative to the\nSouthside bar...\nSimon Baker is on holiday\nstandbys \u00a3&S0\n'.A::;f ef i11II11111111 theatre: rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead What exactly is it about Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead - a play\nabout two of Shakespeare's minor characters -that is so consist end y funny and intriguing?\nThe play is excellent. Two men are thrown\nout of their habitual world, into a place where\nthe laws of probability don't seem to hold, where\ndecisions are not a possibility, identities - particularly their own - are confused, and incidents are\nall that seem to happen. Here is there, some-where, and nowhere. Existential? I think so.\nConfusing? Well not as bad as it sounds, we\nwatch the confusion rather than losing track our-selves. Entertaining? Definitely.\nThe strength of Matthew Francis' new production at the National lies in its success in\nachieving a happy equilibrium between the comedy of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's situation,\nand the underlying menace of destiny and lack of\ncontrol. The humour includes the cheap - with a long build up for a gag punning on the trap which\nRosencrantz and Guildenstern have set and the\ntrap(door) in the stage. Often the dialogue tends\nto the surreal \"Is he selling toffee apples\", and\nthe stage business steps gracefully into vulgarity.\nThe essence of the comedy, however is in Simon\nRussell Beale and Adrian Scarborough's Guildenstem and Rosencrantz (or should that\nbe..). They swing from mood to mood con v inc ingly, and successfully create the rapport\nbetween the two characters. Russell Beale's development of Guildenstem as 'purpose\nand meaning' become more and more\nclearly out of reach is particularly effective\nin balancing the comic and the serious.\nWhilst the travelling players provide\nmuch of the comedy of the play - brilliantly achieved here, particularly in the dumb\nshow -the Player King should generally have\nan enigmatic, threatening presence.\nUnfortunately Alan Howard is disappoint-ing. Though dramatic, I find that he sacrifices his connections with fate and destiny\nto bawdy insinuation just a little to often.\nThe only other performance I would fault is\nthat of the set. It seems alive. Initially this\nis very effective. The first two acts take\nplace in an interior with concealed doors\nunobtrusively emphasising the existential\naspects of the play. This cool interior is\nostentatiously interrupted by each appearance of the Hamlet court members on their the\nmoving podium. It certainly looks lavish, and\nserves to underline the threat to Rosencrantz and\nGuildenstem, but it all seems to be a little too\nmuch show for show's sake. Perhaps this is only\nbecause of the teething problems on the technical side. All the tension of the last scenes is lost\nbecause of clanking and whirring as pieces of set\njerk slowly into place.\nDo go and see it. The technical problems\nreally only crop up in the last ten minutes, and\nby then you will have laughed so hard it won't seem to matter.\n\n"

    "content": "News Felix Friday January 1 2th1996. three\nIC denies nuclear dump allegations\nBY ANDYS IN HA RAY College have openly refuted allegations suggesting that IC. dumps\nharmful radioactive material. The\narticle published in Time Out\nentitled \"Emission Impossible\",\nwhich appeared in the Christmas\nDouble Issue, dealt with\nLondon's licensed nuclear\ndump ers, and suggested that IC\ndisposes of toxic waste in South\nKensington.\nThe piece highlighted the\ndangers of transporting radioactive material through the centre\nof the capital, as well as indicating that London institutions such\nas Brunei University, University\nCollege London, and Bart's Hospital had received enforcement notices from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution\n(HMIP).\nIt further claims that\nImperial College \"has a licence to\naccumulate and dispose of highly\nradioactive, liquid, water and\ngas\", saying that radioactive\nmaterial \"is often brought down\nto London\" from the College's reactor centre in Silwood, near\nAscot in Berkshire. It adds that\nradioactive liquids have been\npoured down IC's drain and that\nradioactive gas has been vented\nout from the Beit Building.\nAlthough certain members\nof College staff had been\napproached by national media -notably Radio 5 Live - to\nrespond to the claims, a statement issued by the press office\nsays IC \"has an authorisation\nwith Her Majesty's Inspectorate\nof Pollution to dispose of radioactive waste by various routes, but\nthe comments in the Time Out\narticle are factually incorrect.\"\nAs Felix was going to press,\nMargaret Minski, a director of\nthe reactor centre at Silwood,\nwas unable to comment but said\nshe would be available next week\nto respond to the allegations.\n'Players'\nBY DIPAK G HO SH Imperial College is trying a radical new approach to sponsorship\nof its sports clubs to generate\nfunds and save substantial money\non orders of sports equipment.\nThe company Players has\nbeen chosen by ICU to supply\nsports equipment to all sports\nclubs for a trial period of six\nmonths. Players is linked to Stac\nSports, and is a big distributor of\nsports kit.\nTim Townend, Deputy\nPresident (F&S), expressed his\ndelight on a good deal for the col-leg e: \"This contract has been well\nnegotiated and we are getting a good deal from four levels.\n'Players' are also very happy to\nhave got this deal with us. We\nhave signed a six month contract\nwith them that takes us to the\nend of the present academic\nyear, and it is very likely that this\ncontract will be renewed for the\nnext academic year.\"\nSports clubs used to put separate orders with different companies which became too ex pen sive. The new centralised\napproach means the Union can\norder all sports equipment\nthrough one company, thus saving money.\nTim Townend has estimated\nPHOTO: DIANA HARRISON\nA suspect vent in the Biology\nbuilding: is IC pumping\nradioactive gas into Beit as\nTime Out all edges? for ICU the probable impact of this con-tract. He received a provisional\norder of \u00a313,500 from eight\nclubs, and this means approximately \u00a32000 in sponsorship\nfunds at the end of six months.\nPlayers deal with all sports\nclothing and equipment and with\na view to renewing the contract\nnext year, the Union is hoping to\ntie in other clubs and societies,\nfor example, Rag, to supply promotional T shirts.\nThe Union is considering\nextending this type of initiative\nto other areas; one possibility is\nthe Dram Soc which could have\nits stage electrics supplied by the\nWhitelights. Another idea for\nsponsorship are the mailings to\nfresher s, which A VM Consulting\nalready does at other colleges.\nThe contract was signed on 1\nDecember, under terms that\ninsist that ICU puts all sports\norder to Players, and in return\n12% of the total order will be\npaid to the Union as a sponsorship fund. Every club which\norders sports kit worth more\nthan \u00a3500 will get a prize of\nsports equipment worth \u00a3125 for\ntheir Player of the Year award. In\naddition, all staff and students\nare eligible for a15% discount on\nsports equipment and clothing.\nPHOTO: ALEX FEAKES\nApart from the obligatory fire alarm, the end-of-term Christmas\nbash was another sell-out success. Over 1100 Carnivalites partied\nround the three dance floors. \"Everyone seemed to think it was one\nof the best events we've run,\" said Ents and Marketing manager\nMark Home.\n\n"
