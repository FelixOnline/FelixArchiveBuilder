    "content": "FELIX Letters to the Editor\nSir The Gloomy Jeremiah in the \"Viewpoint\" column( FELIX Jan. 26th) has expressed an opinion which we hope is not shared by o on s cio us members\nof this college. To say that London University can only consist of athletic rivals and an exam-in ing body is a depressing surrender to the d is advantages of its layout. The difficulties are\nmany, but we believe that \"The University\" is an\nexcellent start towards greater integration of the social life of the various colleges. It is up to all students ( including ii.H.) to support\nthis first move.\nYours etc., S. A. Burdett, A. Gura, R.F. Weston.\nOur contributor replies: Whilst not agreeing with the views expressed\none admits they form a legitimate criticism and\nanother point of view.\n1-I.H.I. C. Union,\nJan. E9th 1951\nSir If the article entitled 'The Paper University' deserves an answer at all, it is: Bunkum.\nPlaces at Oxford and Cambridge are sought after, not because they provide degrees - bigger and better ones can be obtained elsewhere - or unique accents, for which no Education is required at all( Gaw S truth i but because they associate the idea of a University with a wider Education. At school the contention that house spirit should\nbe encouraged, and school spirit discouraged, would\nhave been recognized as folly by the youngest of hero-worshipping fag s.AtI.e. we can claim to provide facilities as good as those of any small University. But we are also members of a major University, and\nwhatever el so may occur at other major Universities we at London should ensure that aB. Sc. (Lond.) has\nhas not only gained a technical qualification but\naltogether benefited by. his years at London University. happily support for U.L.is strong a tI.C.: and\nrightly so, for it's a poor College which can't cont ri bute its fair quota towards University activities as well as organise some decent College ones.\nYours sincerely, K.J. Brookman,\nHon. Sec, U.L. Athletic Club.\nOur contributor replies: If readers remember the article they will realize that Mr. Brookman's first paragraph is even more\nirrelevant than it is incoherent. I couldn't agree more with his second paragraph\nbut at the risk of being drawn by his red herring I might pc in t out that few schools have houses as far apart as Holloway College and Woolwich Polytechnic. Your corre s po indent's claim that I.C. support\nfor U.L.is strong. I dispute this. In every field but athletics, and I covered this point, the feeling a tI.C.o fU. L.U.is just slightly less than\nsomewhat.\nIt is, shall we say, entrancing, to ask how Mr.\nBrookman in noble rage seizes this pen and begins,\n\" Sir...\" But literary effort dissipates this fer v our and in the warm afterglow of a wrong righted Mr. Brookman signs off with, \"Yours sincerely\". H. H.K. U.S. AGAIN.\nJan.29 th,1951 Sir In an article appearing in the FELIX of Jan.\n2 6 th, there was a reference to the recent refer en dum held by the N.U.S. on a proposed d is affiliation from the I.U.S.; the result is significant. The total membership* of the N.U.S. is105,000, yet of this total only54,438( roughly30%) students voted; this is indicative of the general d is gust felt by students at the behaviour of the President of the N.U.S. At the Council meeting last November, he and\nother members threatened to ce sign because of the\ndecision of the Council(757 to622) to remain\naffiliated to the I,U.S. Thi3 undemocratic threat resulted in the present referendum.\nThe issue will be raised at the next Council meeting to be held soon and the real will of the\nstudents, for continued affiliation, must triumph. Yours truly, B.G. Bower, Botany Pert., RCS.\nJan. 29th,1951 SirI think the information and correspondence\nin your column concerning N.U.S., I.U.S. etc, only shows how right I.C. were tod is affiliate when they did. Yours truly, S.H. Mearne.\nSATES\nJan. 27th,1951 SirI am alarmed by the lapse of time between\nthe writing of Mr- Paul G. Jeffrey' s letter to FELIX on the 8 th Jan. 1930 and its inclusion in your last edition. I am pleased to note, however, that Mr. Jeffrey himself, is fully aware of the shortcomings of today's postal services and is taking no chances\nin that he has already despatched invitations to several notable personalities to attend the Brains Trust arranged for Thursday, Feb. 27th.I believe that the next year in which Feb. 27\nhappens to be a Thursday will be 1958.\nYours faithfully, J. S.Kin g,I.C. Union.\nWhich Turning?\nFeb. 1st,1951 SirI have noticed on many occasions that our bus\ndrivers, and I am sure many of our visitors, have\ndifficulty in finding our sports ground at Harrington. Whilst I am not suggesting that we move our ground to some more prominent site( Hyde Park perhaps?) I think it would save further bother if a sign board indicating the whereabouts of the I.C. Sports Ground -were placed at the comer of Sips on Lane and H arlington High Street, i.e. on the waste\nplot opposite the Red Lion. To complete the picture we might even ' straddle' H arlington Corner\nwith two signboards preferably bearing the emblem\nof the R.A. Cw or the A. A.J.A. Mossman, GUILDS.\n(We commend this to the notice of the Athletic Ground Committee. - Ed.)\nOPPORTUNITY!\nJan. 2 6 th,1951 Esteemed Sir, Your rather despairing Editorial has achieved something. It has inspired me - a humble secretary working for a professor and a department amongst\nthe elite of Imperial College to air my gri evan ces. You\" print almost anything\" could I dare\nto presume that you would listen to the woes of a very unlearned young lady? As I say, I am young. I like fun. But because I have not a scientific brain and cannot\nstudy for exams., because I cannot wear anI.C. scarf, because I may not enter the sacred portals of the I.C. Union as a member, I am denied all the\ninnocent joys and pleasures that the College provides. Sir, it is frustrating! I want to watch the\nrug ger matches and the Serpentine Regatta. I want ed to see the Lowry Cup boat race. I would like to help che erI.C. to victory in their football and hockey games. I like dramatics, art, music,\nphilosophy and the rest. I even like beards -though I do not ask to join the Beaver Club ( nor, may I hasten to add, would I be eligible). But all I can do is read the reports in FELIX ( dear FELIX) and hope that one glorious day someone will remember the poor, pining secretaries that are in your midst - ( I was thinking particularly of those under 25).\nWell, anyway, I feel better now!\nYours faithfully.\" Hopeful\"( Miss)( The Editor would point out that we do not normally publish letters under noms de plume unless full name and address are enclosed. Would Miss \"Hope-ful\" kindly supply these details( plus telephone \u2022\nnumber) at her earliest convenience. They will, of course, be treated with the strictest confidence) "

    "content": "f tUX OR I HOCKEY H.C. S.30.&G.0 In1947 the R.C.S. Hockey Club was formed with12 playing members, and during its first season the\nnumbers were often augmented by temporary transfers( non-pecuniary 1) from the other e~ liege hockey tea ms. The Club has since grown in numbers and strength and on Wednesday, } l st January it fulfilled the\nambitions of previous years' sides in beating the City and Guilds by3 goals to0. This victory was\nparticularly gratifying to two founder members,\nMcCall and Groocock who are still playing for the\nClub.\nAlthough Guilds had lost two players to the Un\nive i'ii ty side, the teams appeared well matched be fore the start. In the first half, the game was\neven and dominated by two strong defences playing very steadily on the muddy surface. Half tii e saw\nR.CS. leading through a goal by Watson, and after the interval they forged ahead with goals from Tayl er and Purslow. Are arranged Guilds forward line unsuccessfully adopted short passing tactics in the face of the resolute tackling, but failed to score. Inter College Hockey Table Won Lost Drawn For R.C.S. C.& GR.S.M. Against1 fl-lC-B. W.P. Imperial College1 St. Catharine's College3 This match a tH arlington on Saturday27 th Jan.\nwas played on a glue pot pitch and ended I.C.'s run of11 matches without defeat. I.C. started off in an attacking vein and seemed to be having the best of the early play; howe ver while several of our shots at goal narrowly missed the post St. Catharine's broke away and.by\ngood passing movements on the wings pierced the defence and'scored two goals in rapid succession. After the interval the I.C. defence was happier and played better together; but nothing went\nright for the forwards. Several shots were put just past the post, in two cases by a last min-ute' s deflection from the goalkeeper's out str etc hed toeI A muffled push shot at an open goal must\nbe passed over as discreetly as possible! St. Catharine's scored again before I.C. replied th rough a real beauty from centre forward Jones.\nThough the visitors won by taking their few chances, I.C. attacked spirited ly throughout, with out losing heart. Ho cause for despondency oral rs rm;it was not our lucky day.\nJ, M cC NETBALL Ko official mention has yet been made that I.C. W.S.C. is now very proudly running two netball team3. The\nsecond team lost their first match but should not be\ndiscouraged. We feel that with practice together they\nwill be more successful in the future. With this and\nin view a practice was held last Weds, at which two\nmembers of the Rugger Club offered to play in order\nthat we should have a complete team. However as they\ninsisted on using a rug ger ball the offer was refused We would like to take this opportunity of wishing the second team the best of luck for Saturday, when they\nplay Goldsmiths, and for all their future matches.\nJ.S. RESULT.\nIn pouring rain, ICW3C lost to Royal Holloway Collin an away match played last Saturday.\nWALES BEAT EM AGAIN1 At last Saturday's International, Wales suffered another overwhelming defeat - this time at the hands\nof Scotland. In the second match of this year's Technology\nCup competition, R. S.H. gained a well merited victory over R.C.S. by32. Mines, who include d4rug ger players in their team, scored first thr ough Bow tell but R.C.S. fought back and goals by Browne and Buck roy d put them ahead. However,\ngoals by Bow tell and the K,0.S \u2022 centre half restored the Mines lead which they held to the end.\nThe teams were:\nR.C.S.: Reynolds ( L.F,); Hanson, Lodge; Webb,Abbo tt, Buckrowd; Browne, Watson, Thompson\n(D.E.) capt., Jackman, Reynolds( R. J.)R. S.M.: Edwards; Collins on( capt.); Taylor( C.G.); Hanan, Stevens, Rogers, Eid ridge, Rowse,\nDavies( J.P.), Bow tell, Jarvis. This result ensures that R.C.S. will play in the final and Mines, provided they avoid a3go a I defeat in their game against Guilds, will be their opponents.\nMany I.C. games have had to be cancelled owing\nto the unfit condition of opponents' pitches but the 1 st XI have beaten the Admiralty43 and R.N. R.60 in their two matches.\nThe 2nd XI have drawn league games with Chel sea Poly, and west Ham T.C., while I.C.3 rd XI have\nwon three league encounters in succession; against Battersea Poly.(80), Chelsea Poly,(51) and\nRoyal Dental(40).

    "content": "FELIX\nDRINKING MANS GUIDE6: The Earl of Lonsdale Unless one drinks for drinking'3. sake - and \u2022\nthis can be done almost anywhere - the criteria for an evening out are good company, good beer and\nthe right atmosphere.\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere in the average\nLondon Pub is as .cheery as acharn el house, as mer-ry as a morgue. We well remember sitting in a half empty saloon bar in Bayswater. A magni fi cent English bulldog, broad of chest and heavy of jowl, lifted his leg and tried to put out the fire. As grand a gesture of contempt for un congenial and\ninefficient heating as we would imagine. But did the company cheer? Not they by the expressionless, fish like stares under heavy eyelids they might have been at Lords. The long rule of Victoria and the licensing laws have left their mark on the London Pub. Mahoganu, etched glass, weak beer and painted bar maid - by these we know them.\nBut there is nothing wrong with mahogany or etched glass and occasionally one finds an example\nbf a London Pub - a sturdy, genuine pub; not half timbered in1927, not a dock side tavern in which no self respecting sailor would be seen dead -such\na pub is the Earl of Lonsdale. The Earl of Lonsdale sits, at the top of the\nPortoBello Road market. Perhaps the best time to visit it is on Saturday lunchtime, after surveying what is almost certainly London's most interesting street market.\nIn common with all Hermeky's houses the beer situation is good and the Wine and spirits lists are excellent. The public bar and the saloon are\noften crowded and are not too comfortable, but the lounge is a large room with plenty of chairs and\nan efficient but optional waiter service. The dec orations have a pleasant English haphazard ness: two oils of jovial characters vie with empty magnum e and a magnificent set of copper jugs, which range in size downwards from on eoin which one could, albeit within con ve. P.ence, take a bath. The company is quiet and clearly expect store main so, the lounge is well lit,( soft lighting may\nflatter the ladies' complexions and be very romantic but it kills conversation). In general one may say\nthat the Earl of Lonsdale is a pub from which to start crawling rather than one in which to spend along evening.

MOUNTAINEERING: BY PROFESSOR FINCH\nOn Tuesday, in his talk to the Mountaineering Club, Prof. Finch showed us some excellent photo graphs of climbing in the Alps, the Corsican Mount a in s and the Himalayas. He gave the Club some-thing to think about. One photo, showed about 6\npeaks which looked a commendable day's climbing for any man. After crossing all6 he \"stopped\njust down there for breakfast\". On Mt. Blanc there was a climb which he admit-ted was a\" bit steep\". His companion thought he\nhad lean this ice axe safely against the rock only to find that he had misjudged the angle of the rock: the axe was leaning outwards, immediately over ba lanced and fell300 ft. before bouncing and d is app eared from view.\nHe was with the Everest expedition and told us\nthat although they suffered what we would call extreme hardships and d\"iscomfort they were quite happy and thought themselves comfortable up there because the discomfort increased only slowly as they ascended. They were mainly defeated by the weather\u00ab the extreme cold forced them to retreat from\nquite near the summit, and by the time they had recovered from frostbite etc the monsoon had arrived. M.R.

    "content": "FELIX PROFILE Sherry Those of you who do not know \"Sherry's\" real name are about to be enlightened it is Miss C. Sherwood, A fair description of her would be\n\" Fairy Godmother and lady of the Lamp\", as all residents will agree.\nWhen she came here at a tender age m the early19 \u00a30's she was a Junior Shorthand Typist. Within a very few years, however, she rose to Superintendent Shorthand Typist, in which capacity she was called upon to take on all the correspondence of * he then Rector, Sir Thomas Holland, and of the Secretary, Mr. Alexander Gow.\nRelinquishing the title of Superintendent Typi st in1934, she continued as personal secretary to the Rector and amanuensis to the Secretary. It was\nin these capacities that she had access to Staff records and began to learn the birth dates of cons ider able numbers of College personalities. The\ncelebration of birthdays became quite a hobby, and\nit is anybody's guess how much of her personal in come has been spent on birthday presents for her large adopted family. During the last war Miss Sherwood was an act ive and leading member of the College Maintenance\nParty, and it was during this period that she acquired the nickname of \"Sherry.\" - though.that name did not generally catch on until about 1946. Nowaday,\nof course, all residents know her as Sherry. Beiore$939 the hostel was an all male institution, Necess i to us circumstances altered this state of affairs when the Maintainance Party lived there during the\nwar. So it was not unnatural that on its rebirth in1945, the hostel emerged with a small female cont in gent. As a direct result of this change, Sherry\na qui red yet another title, that of Hostel Hostess.\nIn this capacity she gradually devoted more and more\nof her time to the welfare of the residents until about 18 months ago, even her room moved considerably nearer the hostel. Who,now,could be more Nelson ic than she, when a case of slight infringement of Hostel regulations occurs? Or who more like a ministering angel to all those who fall sick? Every one gets personnal\nattention, evening, n epidemic l Who delights more than she in a th oro uh knowledge of the \" affair(e)s\" of the residents? And\nwho could be a more constant supporter of Union\nSocial activities, from Dinner in Hall to Carnivals. So much for her history. It is the story of a great hearted lady who has combined eff ici en cv and\nkeen interest in a variety of jobs with a kindly disposition and who is now somewhat akin to \"The\nOld Woman Who Lived In a Shoe\" - with this diff e rence - Sherry very definitely does know what to do,\nand does it to the great benefit of all her\" children\". SLIDING IN SNOWDONIA Those members who forsook, early after Christ mas, the seasonal indulgences and assembled in the familiar North Wales Climbing ground were rewarded\nwith snow and ice conditions par excellence. At first it was necessary to acc lim at is e ourselves to the rig ours of the Arctic in Snowdonia, but through\nout spirits were high and even when the summits were!\ninvisible, they were attained. To the pleasure of winter climbing was added\nthe best of accommodation and the Spartan New Year celebrations were quite uncharacteristic of our Kensington habits, as we remarked to each other in the baron the first day of term. This was as\nwell, as New Year's Day saw us involved in the aust ere business of mountain rescue. Occasional efforts of the geologists to brown-bag were frustrated, and if scientific methods appeared in our climbing, that was purely coincidental. Efforts to track the Abominable Snowman were a fail jure. In all, a grand trip, with many reminders of a good ten days, not the least being the physical one: that tobogganing on one's seat was not the moSt j satisfactory way of coming down a gully! JEWISH SOCIETY\nA Jewish Society has recently been formed in the College. It is hoped that all Jewish students will be interested and offer their support. Details, of the first meeting will shortly be announced.\nThe Hon. Sec. is Miss S. Cohen (Union or Huxley\nracks). C& G.ENG. SOC. DINNER Preceded at5 p.m. by the Distinguished Visitor's address - \" Pluto and other pipelines\" by A.C. Hartley Esq., Chief Engineer of The Anglo Iranian Oil Co., the annual dinner of the C.&G. Engineering Society was held on Feb. 1 st. The function was attended by77 members and guests. Prof. Will is Jackson proposed \"The Society\", remarking on the advantages of silent supplication when locating or correcting mechanical faults in machinery.\nReplying, the chairman, Mr. H.J. Merrick referred to the great interest shown by members of the Society in visits of an e ducat ive, but nontechnical nature, to such places of industry as Stag Brewe ry. He stressed the need for more student papers\nand hoped to see some lively competition for the Links Club Memorial Prize. Prof. Yeoman (RSM) with his reply to \"The Gues ts\" provided just the right amount \"of light hear ted banter required to balance the evening's speeches\nRising with a remark to the effect that he had been\nknown to go on for two hours, Prof. Yeoman was content\nwith five minutes of remark-punctuated laughter. Erskine Sinies Esq. K.C. in proposing \"The Prof es sion\" gave as his engineering qualification one\nweek's engineering with a pick and shovel,( Course\nwork on boats and barges) while serving as PB I Suba lter n during the Great War. Since then, he added,\nhis activities at the bar( legal variety) have frequently been due to the ambition, or failure, of engineer's to appreciate such points as the precise legal difference between a pipe and a sewer. He\ntherefore took pleasure in proposing the continued prosperity of engineers and their profession. The barrels, afi rk in of bitter and a pin of mild, were put to good use, and at11.15 the last10 survivors, their repertoire of amusing but, alas, unprintable stories still apparently inexhaustible, were ejected from the Union, well satisfied with an enjoyable and successful evening.\n_____,_,_iL Ji JJ<~ ilo.fl mb \u00a3J LOCAL AMENITIES \"Good afternoon, Sir. No, you are not too late, it's only five to five. It's always students who\ndome in at the last minute. They seem to think we are here to suit them. We've go tour hours, the same as everyone else. And a little consideration... \"How would you like it cut? You've very wiry hair which would look very nice if you treated it properly. I suppose you use some advertised cream.\nIt's no good. You are getting very thin on the topI do wish I could persuade you to try some of our special preparation; it will keep your hair tidy and help it to grow. Now, if you let me give you a shampoo it will get rid of all that nasty scurf and with our special oil you will never be troubled again.\" Well, if you were sick you would go to a doc-tor and I am at rich o logi st and know what I'm talking about.\n\"Have it your own way! The customer knows\nbest and I always get on very well with them. If they are satisfied they tip me - some of the stu dents tip even half a crown and, as you say, if they are not they would not come again. \"How is that? Shampoo? A little of our special cream? Are you all right for brushes, combs, razor blades, nail files, eyebrow pluck ers, hair Your coat, Sir!

Mr.\nNicholas' letter to Mr. Coomber printed in the last edition of your esteemed journal? He did not write\" I would be grateful if, at your convenience, you would relieve me of my present appointment\", but\" I would be grateful if you would relieve me of-my\npresent appointment at your convenience\".\nYours faithfully, A.

SANATORIUM APPEAL On Jan.1 st of this year was launched the biggest appeal for funds that has ever been attempted\nby students in this country. The sum of \u00a350,000 is required to build a sana to rium for those students who are recovering from\nT.B. In this sanatorium facilities for studying will be one of the chief features, so that when a student returns to his or her college the loss of time through illness will be as small as possible. In Gt. Britain and N. Ireland there are approx im at ely160,000 students. If we all give a minimum of half a crown, this Fund will reach \u00a320,000\nimmediately. This sum is eon side red by the Appeal\nOrganisers to be sufficiently large to act as a\" catalyst\" for wide range of activities that are planned in order to raise the remaining \u00a330,000.\nIt is desirable that each College should have\nits own Appeal Organisation. So far, two members\nof I.C., Mr. J. P.O 'Brien and Mr. A. A. Levy have shown a keen interest in this appeal and are forming the nucleus of the I.C. Organisation. You can help in atleast three ways:-TT~ Offer your help to the I.C. Organisation2) Come forward with any ideas you may have\nfor raising funds in I.C.3) Pay your half a crown when the collection starts it will be given full publicity. Half a crown per head in I.C. means a total of atleast \u00a3200 - surely we can beat this target! This is a really deserving cause - let us show\nthe National Organisers that I.C. knows how to supp or t\"A GOOD THING\".\nAll enquiries should be made to D.Y. Coomber,\nJ. P.O 'Brien or A. A. Levy, c/oI. C. Union. ,\nLITTLE BLAND ISH MEANT A TEH:\" DE DCO' J LEG E Bedford and I. C.at their joint. Debating Soci e ties' meeting (played away: lost4223) managed\nto say nothing quite well and -ju it e often, on\nthe motion to 'Vote no Orchids for His s Bland ish.' Kiss Mary La vine, President of Bedford D.S. was in the chair, and the denial of orchids was proposed\nby Miss Jean Day. John Osborne prepared to oppose,\nfortified with beer from his despatch box, and then\nproduced EVIDENCE - 1) The book (of the film of\nthe play of the book which *was banned) and 2-the play of the book which was Banned) and 2) Miss Bland is h,ina2 dimensional projection selected-from 200 offered from a notable collection. Miss Jaque lln eLeigh seconded, pointing out the\ncomparison that, whereas Scarlet tO 'Hara and Amber\nSt. Clair were heroines who were prepared to pay for their ambitions, Miss B. was a mere ( subjective) \u2022\ndummy in several games - and not worthy of compliments at10. a spray.\nMax Reis clinched the oppositions' case with quotations from the book, some orchids which he presented Jo Miss B. to keep her warm, and some red\nherrings( such as discussion of the original motion,\non debauchery, in which Bedford, apparently, would'nt\nBacchus.) He then finished the beer,\nranged from oo mph to cabbages and tilted at the Windm ill and Folies Berger es. Mr L.G. Palmer spoke no\nless than seven times (from the floor); the hon.\noppose r coined the word \" in disp it ably\"; The Pre s ident at one time said her members' honour vu In danger; it was found however, on a show of h nds,\nthat only4 persons present had read the book.\nHalf of I.C. were too late for the vote, but of course were in time for the refreshments, the dance,\nand the ladies which between them devoted the rest of the evening to healing outrageous misfortune.

Whilst agreeing with M.H. that London is a geographically impossible University in comparison\nwith both Oxford and Cambridge, surely it is just for this reason that the' publication of 'Univer-s it y' should be landed: through lis pages we can\nat least mitigate the disadvantages of spatial separation from our brother and sister colleges.' University' may no/ be capable of fostering a University Spirit but atleast it gives us news\nof other colleges. M.H. rightly admitted inter college co-oper-ation in sport. This hardly needs emphasis, for it in this field as much as any that a University' spirit' is fostered. But there are other fields in which inter college activities are real enough.\nTo name a few: there are the inter college debates ( in which this college plays a prominent\npart - we are semifinalists in this year's Debates contest); our Dramatic Society lias es with the University Society and will next week be ta king part in the One-Act Play Festival; and although\nwe cannot conveniently use the Union facilities at Bloomsbury as much as we would wish, it is suite certain that I.C. puts a lot of enthusiasm\nand hard work into the running of U.L. Union through\nU.L. U. Council. In fact, in spite of our 'out of'\ntown' location, the influence of I.C.i nU.L. U. affairs has seldom been greater. Though many of us would like to see a more\ncompact University of out own built around the nucleus of the present colleges at South Ken sing ton, until this desirable state of affairs is realised we must make the best of the present scat te red University. We feel that the newspaper 'Univer-s it y,'in spite of its limitations and short ww l nfs, has a useful contribution to make in the present\ncircumstances and deserves our support.\nTOUCHSTONE\nThere will be another Touchstone this week-end\n(Saturday Febuary 10th}. The subject to be discussed will be \" Superstition\". One member of the Board was\nthe 13th to apply. NEW METHOD OF ADDITION Napier is justly renowned for his work on the\ncommon logarithm, by means of which multiplication is transformed into addition: but how much more illustrious the man who can transform a tedious add-it ion into the simple multiplication of two in te g ers! After a lifetime spent in research, I now\nclaim to have solved this problem, which has baffled mathematicians down the ages. It rust that my work, here published for the first time, may be\nof value to those 'Lesser breeds without the law'\nas Kipling so neatly describes engineers and chem-is ts, as well as mathematicians. The longtime taken over my researches is partly tb be attributed to the abstraction of the brief case containing my\nnotes from my barrel one day when I was absent.\nAn example is sufficient to expound my technique. Suppose, for instance, we wish to add two\nclumsy numbers such as 17.69897 and 35.778I5. We\nderive the antilogarithm s of these numbers (from\ntables). These are5 x10n and6 x10* \u00b0 . Ref e rence to five times tables shows the product of these tobe 30 x lO*1\n*, the logarithm of which is53.47712. This is the answer required. This method is, of course, universally applicable.

Somerset Mourn 1\nPROF. WEINER A TI.C On Thursday, 25th January, Imperial College was honoured with the presence of Prof. Weiner,\nthe distinguished American mathematician, expert\non Cybernetics, when he gave a lecture entitled \"The Two Industrial Revolutions\" in the Guilds Lecture Theatre. Prof. Levy, the chairman, introduced Prof. Weiner to the audience consisting of the Rector and over200 staff and students, by stating that' Prof. Weiner and he had studied together at Go.ttingen University This fact was frequently referred to in the subsequent lecture and discussion when each Professor in turn revealed apart of the\nother's student life, in a constant friendly International battle. Prof. Weiner's lecture was calculated to stir his audience to thought. He began by recounting some of the great, changes which had come over the\nworld as a result of the first Industrial Revolution, when a team power was first harnessed by man.\nHe rapidly called his audience's attention to the'\nfact that this was not indeed the first industrial revolution, but that a minor one had preceded it: that in which the clock had been born. The clock makers had been the first to master the craft of working to fine limits, and had been the first to invent the machines which were to be the forerunners of the lathes without which engineering today\ncould not exist. He continued by recalling the effects the. fi rst industrial revolution had upon the world; how\nthe revolution had made conditions such that man\n\" could no longer sell himself as a source of power\"\nMan had to rise to a higher plane to find employ- .\nment. He had not only to do work, but to make dec is ions, which depended upon previous decisions. Prof. Weiner then passed on to the discussion of a second industrial revolution, which we were\njust about to enter. He claimed that the development of computing machines and similar apparatus\nhad reached such a stage that in the next few year;,\nfactories could be made largely automatic and require only a small maintenance staff to keep them\nrunning smoothly. This process would be accelerated if war were to break out, which, said the Pro\nfess or, every Briton and American hoped would not\nbe so. If man did not misuse his newly won powers,\nwhen the second revolution came, the world's inhab-it ants would be faced with a much larger amount of leisure. They must therefore find useful, constructive ways of employing their leisure time, and\nfor this purpose he suggested are version to the cottage industries of weaving and carpentry. Prof. Weiner concluded by speculating on the probable different course of the .development of the\nWestern World if the electric motor had been invented before the steam engine. It was his opinion that the cottage industries would never have ceased\nas power could have been brought to the home. He\nfelt that in the east, where the first Industrial Revolution had not struck a. full blow, the two rev-ol ut ions may well come together and a new civilization begin. A lively and learned discussion followed. Prof. Levy asked if it were possible to make a machine to write music. His machine could be set at a length of tune of20 bars, say, and be instructed what not es the tune was to contain. It would then, at\nthe touch of a switch \"churn out\" every tune of that length which had been written and which will ever be\nwritten. The question aroused great laughter in the audience which turned to hearty applause when a vote of thanks was called for the Professor at the conclusion of the meeting.\n(Our FELIX inventor found the task of producing the\nmusic machine a complete snip, so quickly briefed out the drawings here reproduced, showing the first design. It is felt that' it will soon be possible to produce the machine in a little more compact\nform, when it should become a boon to every house-wife). B_.__ "
