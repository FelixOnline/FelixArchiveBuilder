Ever\nsince he learned how to steam broccoli in his first year of university, it has\nbeen a staple of his diet \u2013 and what an excellent choice that was. Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables are known for\npreventing poprostate, colorectal, lung\nand breast cancer \u2013 but how?\nGlucosinolate\nGlucosinolates, which give cruciferous\ngreens their flavour, convert into isothi-ocyanates with the help of gut bacteria,\nwhich reduce activation of carcinogens,\nincrease detoxification, reduce apoptosis\n(cell death), reduce the number of DNA\nmutations and most importantly inhibit\nthe growth of cancer cells.\nIn the New York Times bestseller, How\nNot To Die, Dr Michael Greger repeats\nthe importance of broccoli so often, that\nit is not a surprises when he states that\nbroccoli can reduce the chances of developing this or that type of cancer or lung\ndisease.\nMicro and Macronutrients\nBroccoliisfullofvitalmicronutrientssuch\nas Potassium (10%), Iron (6%), Vitamin C\n(150%) and Vitamin A (5%) (PICA) and has\na solid balance of macronutrients. One\nstalk of broccoli, which is roughly three\ntimes the serving size, has 4.3g of protein,\n0.56g of fat, 10g of carbohydrates (4g fi-bre, 2.5g sugars) and 51 calories. Broccoli\nis also filled with water, which keeps the\nbody hydrated, has 0% cholesterol, 2% of\nthe recommended daily intake of sodium,\nless than 1% of saturated fats and most\nimportantly, it is very fun to eat. Broccolis\nare like little delicious trees.\nHow to Prepare\nThe first thing that any Chemistry student knows is that if you add energy in\nthe form of heat, you can transform A +\nB into C + D. Adding heat energy to food\ntransforms it from raw to cooked. No surprises there. However, when it comes to\nbroccoli, the method of cooking significantly impacts nutrient retention. The\nbest method, steaming, preserves chlo-rophyll, soluble proteins, sugar, vitamin\nC and glucosinolates the best. The way to\nsteam is to boil water, place a steaming\nbasket on top with the chopped broccoli and a lid and steam for 10 minutes.\nThe second-best method is to roast\nthe broccoli in the oven for\n30-35 minutes at roughly\n200\u00b0C. Thirdly, microwave\nthe broccoli for 5 minutes\nat 1000W. This is a fast,\ncheap way to cook the\nbroccoli without losing a\nsignificant portion of the\nnutrients via water losses.\nBoiling the broccoli in\nwater for five minutes leaches out most water-soluble nutrients such as Vitamin C, Vitamin K and\nwater-soluble sugars.\nBoiling broccoli also makes them very\nsoft and uncomfortable to eat. Steamed\nbroccoli are crunchy to eat, while roasting broccoli in the oven makes them very\ndelicious, especially when paired with\nyour favourite spices and a little bit of oil\nto coat.\nGrow to love\nBroccoli is the most hated vegetable\namong children; a running joke within\nour society that has damaged its image\nquite a bit. Truth be told, broccoli is not\nonly incredibly healthy and delicious,\nbut also requires little water, is cheap to\ngrow and emits very little carbon (0.27kg\nper pound, of which the majority is transportation and packaging). I agree with\nFilip; I am also Team Broc.\nSundays, join our WhatsApp, subscribe\nto our mailing list or better yet and buy\nour \u00a325 annual membership, which is a\nsteal because we missed the deadline to\nincrease membership prices.\nIf you sign up to our\nmailing list, you will\nbe able to sign up to\nthe Autumn -Term trip\ntaking place in November.

It spans her from her childhood in Nigeria, to her\neventual marriage to the husband she would soon leave\nin England \u2013 Sylvester Onwordi (embodied by the character Francis in the novel) \u2013 and her time spent being\ncondensed into the mould of the \u2018working-class immigrant\u2019.\nThe novel is scandalous in many\nways, serving to break apart the many\ndelusions of Britain\u2019s colonial conquest,\nby outstripping the outrageousness of Britain\u2019s colonial conquest with its raw presentation of a post-coloni-al experience. This is a story of dangerous childminders,\nmeningitis mistaken for malaria, and the various highs\nand lows of the motherhood of five children (and argu-ably, one husband) in less-than-desirable conditions. It\nis an outrageous novel because, for the most part, it is\ntrue.\nEmecheta achieves a feat that feels unique to this\nkind semi-autobiographical novel: it paints two portraits simultaneously. One is a candid description of her\nlife growing up in Nigeria, the struggles of losing two\nparents, and achieving self-hood within the male-pref-erential terrain of Igbo culture at the time. The other\npaints a portrait of England, itself grappling with the\ntumults of the era, but for Emecheta and many others\nlike her, a time of rapid condensation from their previous lives into the boxes available for them as poor and\ndiscriminated against in this new land.\n\u201cYou must know,\u201d as Francis, the semi-autobiograph-ical husband, says, \u201cyou may be a million publicity officers board before the Americans; you may be earning\na million pounds a day; you may have hundreds of serv-ants; you may be living like an \u00e9lite, but the day you land\nin England, you are a second-class citizen.\u201d Roll credits.\nBut as much as it is a damning narrative, it is also one\nof joy, hope, and faith. The experience of an aspiring\nwriter finding her way in a new world, finding her hopes\nandpassions,andfindingGod,laterbecomingoneofthe\nforemost\nwriters on\nthe immigrant experience and an unmatchable influence on the generations after her.\nI have a list of names of people I plan to cajole into\nreading this book. Through a Black British lens, it reads\nless like a memoir than a manifesto (with its section titles like \u2018Learning the Rules\u2019, \u2018Applying the Rules\u2019, and so\nforth). But to a broader audience, curious about where\nto start in Black British Literature, here is a book serving\nup a beautiful education, about all the ways you need to\nmind the transatlantic gap, finding a faith in God, and,\nas Buchi Emecheta puts it, \u201cthe birth of [a] dream\u201d.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001d\u001a\u0019\u001b\u0018\u0017\u001d\u0018\u0016\u001d\u001a\u0019\u0015\u001c\u0016\u0014\u0019\n\u0013\u0012\u001b\u001b\u0019\u0011\u0017\u001d\u0010\u0015\u001d\u000f\u001c\u0019\n\u0015\u001d\u000e\u0019 \u001e\u0018 \u001d\u000e\u001b\nThe novel is scandalous in many\nways, serving to break apart the many\ndelusions of Britain\u2019s colonial conquest,\nby outstripping the outrageousness of Britain\u2019s colonial conquest with its raw presentation of a post-coloni-al experience.

Boutrolle called the policy\n\u201cembarrassing\u201d, saying it sent \u201cthe wrong message\u201d.\nThe College has, since 2020, responded with\nthe same defence when questioned on its FFC\ninvestments. It says that actively engaging with\nsome FFCs will enable it to have a longer-term\nimpact than divestment. \u2018We have been clear that\nwe will monitor progress, and only continue to work\nwith companies who demonstrate commitment\nand credible action to achieve [Paris Agreement]\ntargets,\u2019 reads a recent statement sent to Felix on\nthe matter.\nBoutrolle, however, has a fundamentally different\nview of Imperial\u2019s role in the transition to net zero.\nImperial is \u201ca research institution, not an investment\nfirm,\u201d she said. She sees the College\u2019s continued\ninvestment in FFCs as a \u201cpoor example\u201d, and feels\nthat if it is to invest in any companies, it should be\ndoing so in ones that are \u201cactually trying to make a\npositive change and not just offset their use of fossil\nfuels\u201d.\nBoutrolle\u2019s stance represents a victory for the\ndivestment movement at Imperial, and is part of a\nbigger story of student politics at the College. For\nseveral years now, various student-led campaigns\nhave sought to convince Imperial to stop investing\nin FFCs. Divest Imperial carried the torch for some\ntime, and was especially active in 2019/20 with its\nstunts on campus. It achieved its biggest success as\npart of the working group that developed Imperial\u2019s\nSocially Responsible Investment policy in 2020.\nIn that policy document, which sets out Imperial\u2019s\ncurrent position, the College agreed to divest from\nFFCs that are not working towards meeting Paris\nAgreement targets.\nBut for many students, this was not enough \u2013 they\nwanted more: divestment from all FFCs, with no\nexclusions. Over the past two years, Imperial Climate\nAction (ICA) has emerged, acting as a conduit for\nthis group. ICA has been vocal, but the College has\nnot changed its position on FFC investment.\nYour Editor recently watched the Broadway show\nHamilton, and some of Boutrolle\u2019s words echoed\nthose of Aaron Burr in the musical. A running refrain\nthroughout the show is Burr\u2019s desire to be in \u2018the\nroom where it happens\u2019. Burr wants to be present\nwhen the most important political decisions are\nmade \u2013 to have a seat at the table, so that he can\ninfluence policymaking.\n\u201cWe just need a voice in that room where decisions\nare made,\u201d said Boutrolle, speaking with reference\nto the College\u2019s wider sustainability policy.\nFinally, after years of campaigning, student\nenvironmentalists have a seat at the table, a place in\n\u2018the room where it happens\u2019. Yes, Divest Imperial had\na say in the College\u2019s current policy, but in Boutrolle,\nactivists have a Union President \u2013 the most\nprominent student voice on campus, and a member\nof College Council, Imperial\u2019s governing body. And\nshe certainly isn\u2019t afraid to make her views known. .\n\n"

It has been widely discussed and debated ... Our position on\nthe issue has been publicly documented\nfor more than 30 years, including in publications such as our Annual Report and\nSustainability Report.\u201d\nActivists claim Shell continues to\ndelay climate action, even after the Coalition\u2019s dissolution. Earlier this year, it\nU-turned on plans to reduce annual oil\nproduction by 1 to 2% per year, instead\nannouncing that production would remain stable until 2030. \u201cIt remains our\nview that global energy demand will\ncontinue to grow and be met by different\ntypes of energy \u2013 including oil and gas,\u201d\nsaid Connolly.\nEquinor currently sponsor the Science\nMuseum\u2019s Wonderland gallery, consisting of interactive science exhibits. According to The Guardian, this contract\nalso included a \u2018gagging clause\u2019. The\nNorwegian oil company has come under\nfire over the new Rosebank oil field in the\nNorth Sea, which was recently approved\nby British regulators. \u201cWe are still in contract with the museum and title sponsor\nof Wonderlab: The Equinor Gallery,\u201d said\nAlice Baxter, media spokesperson from\nEquinor.\nHowever, most of the recent outcry\nabout the Science Museum has been\nabout the Adani Group. Adani is a company within the Indian conglomerate\n\u2013 whose diverse operations include coal\nmining and thermal power plants \u2013 is\nsponsoring a Science Museum exhibi-tion. From early 2024, Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery\nwill display the latest climate science and\ntechnological solutions to combatting\nthe climate crisis. Science education is\nnot new to the Adani Group \u2013 its community engagement wing is educating\nthousands of students in India. However,\nactivists believe Adani\u2019s educational initiatives do not excuse the environmental\nand ethical violations that other companies in the Adani Group have conducted.\nFor example, the Group operates coal\nmines in India, Indonesia, and Australia\n\u2013 some of which are on indigenous land.\nEven Adani Green, a renewable energy company and title sponsor of the\nScience Museum exhibition, has not\nescaped without scrutiny. Their solar\npower plants in India have been accused\nof displacing farmland and using too\nmuch freshwater. Many of the environmental and human rights abuses Adani\nGroup have carried out were mentioned\nin the Science Museum\u2019s own due diligence report in 2020 \u2013 but this report\nseems to have been ignored or circumvented by claiming to partner only with\nAdani Green. However, a report by the\nresearch firm Hindenburg challenges the\nindependence of Adani Green from the\nGroup\u2019s coal mines. The Adani Group did\nnot respond to our request for comment.\nHow has the Science Museum\nreplied?\nThe SMG has signed up to the Science-Based Target Initiative, which\ntracks companies who have committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nTheir direct carbon emissions have fallen\nby 69% since 2011/12, and they aim to be\nnet-zero by 2033. As of 2022, the SMG\nalso asks for partners to be on track to\nmeet Paris Agreement climate goals by\nthe end of March 2024, which they are\nassessing using the Transition Pathway\nInitiative. This initiative has given the\ndecarbonisation pathways of BP, Shell,\nand Equinor the best possible classification \u2013 despite itself reporting in 2020\nthat no fossil fuel companies are on track\nto meet these goals.\n\u201cExternal funding has been vital to the\ntransformation of our five museums\u201d,\nsaid a Science Museum Group spokes-person, \u201ccreating inspiring, free spaces\nwhere millions of visitors can immerse\nthemselves in authentic stories about\nscience, engineering, mathematics, and\nBP\n\u2022 STEM outreach initiatives have reached around 2.8 million British students over the past five years.\n\u2022 One of the first oil and gas giants to announce ambitions for net zero by\n2050, and one of the only ones to have emissions reduction targets covering the Scope 3 targets.\n\u2022 Supported biodiversity projects in Georgia, Turkey, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\u2022 Developing three offshore wind farms in the North Sea and Irish Sea, and\nconstructing a solar power plant that should power around 14,000 homes.\n\u2022 Spent 97% of its investments in fossil fuels and generated 0.17% of its energy from renewable sources in 2022.\n\u2022 LobbiedagainstrestrictionsonmethaneemissionsintheUnitedStatesin2019.\nShell\n\u2022 Encourages 14-16 year old girls to pursue careers in engineering, and funded\na workshop which has trained over 215,000 students in engineering skills.\n\u2022 Aims to reduce operational emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2016\nlevels, and the net carbon intensity of its energy products by 100% by 2050\nwith the same baseline.

And there are still\noutstanding marks that they\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to stress is how seriously we take in this, it\u2019s not a simple\nlip-service exercise.\u201d\n\u201cPoor communication and\nbaffling decisions\u201d\nOne of the complainants\u2019 principal grievances is poor communication from the\ndepartment. An email sent to students in\nMay specified which examinations had not\nbeen marked as a result of the MAB. But,\nallege the complainants, it later transpired\nthat the details in the email were incorrect.\nFurthermore, in mid-July, students were\nsent emails to inform them of their progression status. At this time, some modules had been marked in full, and some\nonly partially, as a result of the MAB.\nThe department told students that, provided they had passed all the fully-marked\nmodules, they would be given provisional\npasses \u2013 allowing them to progress to the\nnext year.\nIf it was later found that they had failed\na MAB-affected module, they would have\nto resit the relevant exam in the next academic year (2023/24).\nTo avoid the risk of an additional exam\nthe following year, students were told they\ncould resit the exam in August 2023 \u2013 before they knew whether they had failed.\n\u201cOn what basis does the department\n[think] the student should resit the exam?\u201d\nasks the complaint.\n\u201cThis is an unenviable choice,\u201d it contin-ues. \u201cEither suddenly revise for an exam\nwith only a month\u2019s notice \u2013 potentially\nonly to find out that you actually passed\n\u2013 or cram the exam in with a multitude of\nothers in the following year.\u201d\nIn order to aid students with the choice,\nthe department reviewed the marks they\ndid hold, and made a judgement on whether it was likely students would pass the affected modules. The complaint submitted\nto the College says it was unclear how this\njudgement was made.\nSome second-year students on the MSci\ntrack were distressed to find that the department had advised them to transfer to\nthe BSc programme. The Physics department requires that students achieve above\na certain grade threshold in order to progress to an MSci. \u201cDue to the marking and\nassessment boycott, we cannot confirm\nwhether these criteria have been reached,\u201d\nreads one email advising a student to\ntransfer to a BSc.\n\u201cWe are being pressured to take decisions with incomplete information, on\nshort notice, and with poor communication,\u201d summarise the complainants. They\nallege that the problems they have encountered are \u201cpart of a wider culture of poor\ncommunication and baffling decisions\u201d.\nSome students have told Felix that they\nremain in a state of confusion. One said\nthey were left \u201ccritically depressed and\nanxious\u201d.\n\u201cThe teachers have every right to strike,\nbut the department has been fucking inept\nat dealing with the fallout,\u201d said another.\nContaldi, the Deputy Head of Department, said that improving communication\nwas his \u201cnumber one priority\u201d, and that\nthe department was recruiting more staff\nto address the problem.\n\u201cWe have a huge, huge focus on this\nnow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing the admin\nsupport we have in delivering the undergraduate degree, because we\u2019ve been understaffed for many years. It\u2019s going to be a\nreal game-changer for Physics.\u201d\nThe department has appointed Professor Richard Thompson to investigate the\ncomplaint, and the outcome of his investigation is expected in the coming weeks.\nNEWS THREADS\nWeekly bulletin\nPhysics undergrads submit complaint to College after\nMAB leaves department in chaos\n69 undergraduates from Imperial\u2019s Physics department have submitted a formal complaint to the College over the department\u2019s response to the marking and\nassessment Boycott (MAB). The complaint asks for a refund of 15% of tuition\nfees for the 2022/23 academic year. Physics students have been disproportionately affected by the MAB, as many boycotters are members of the department.\nStudents in the first two years of the undergraduate programme have been left\nin a state of uncertainty. Some have still not received their examination grades\nfor 2022/23, and many have struggled to secure their preferred modules for this\nyear as a result. (p. 1 & p. 6)\nRoyal College of Music professor suspended after\nmisconduct allegations\nMark Messenger, a senior professor at the Royal College of Music (RCM), has\nbeen suspended after complaints were received about his behaviour. The RCM\nis one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious conservatoires, and is nestled between Imperial\u2019s Royal School of Mines and the Bone Building, on Prince Consort Road.\nThe Times reports that Messenger denies wrongdoing. Sources who spoke to the\nnewspaper claim there is a code of silence about alleged wrongdoing.\nThe RCM said it had launched an independent, external investigation following\nthe complaints, and that it could provide no further comment while that was\nongoing. \u201cThe welfare and development of our students is central to [us]\u201d, said a\nspokesperson for the conversatoire.\nCollege stance on fossil fuel company investments is\n\u201cembarrassing\u201d\n, says ICU President\nICU President Camille Boutrolle has delivered a stark rebuke of the College\u2019s\npolicy on fossil fuel investments. The College says it invests in fossil fuel companies (FFCs) that demonstrate \u2018commitment and credible action\u2019 towards the\nnet-zero transition. But in a wide-ranging interview with Felix, Boutrolle called\nfor Imperial to divest its money away from FFCs. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role\nof Imperial,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a research institution, not an investment firm. And\nthere are better companies out there actually trying to make a positive change\nand not just offset their use of fossil fuels.\u201d (pp.4-5)\nThree arrested in protests on High Street Kensington\nThree people were arrested by police on Monday night after pro-Palestinian\nprotestors gathered outside the Israeli Embassy on High Street Kensington,\njust a 15-minute walk from Imperial. Smoke filled the air as protestors lit flares,\nwaved flags and chanted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d. At High Street Kensington Tube Station, police officers were forced to intervene when tensions between Palestinian\nand Israeli supporters threatened to boil over. The protests came as Hamas, the\nPalestinian militant group governing the Gaza strip, launched a surprise attack\non Israel. Its fighters entered Israeli border villages, killing civilians and taking\ndozens hostage. The Israeli death toll has exceeded 1,200 at the time of writing,\nwhile over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel\u2019s retaliatory air strikes.\nWe are always looking for story tips \u2013 whether that be changes\non campus or serious cases of injustice.

Paul\nSteinberg\u2019s set is a testament to minimalism done correctly; the set itself is\ngrey and bare, with few elements in any\ngiven scene. The effect of this adds to the\nstory beautifully, reminding us that, despite the onslaught of wit and slapstick\ncomedy throughout the opera (credits to\nthe direction of David Alden), there is an\nunderlying psychological emptiness and\nloneliness felt by our titular anti-hero.\nThe role of Peter Grimes was to be\nplayed by Gwyn Hughes Jones, however Jones had suffered a cold and so was\nreplaced by John Findon whose most recent performance was as the dwarf Mime\nin ENO\u2019s production of Rheingold. So far,\nJohn Findon has been seen playing secondary character roles in ENO produc-tions, but after being thrown into centre\nstage for this production of Peter Grimes,\nit is evident that ENO would be foolish to\nnot use him as their go-to tenor lead in\nfuture. The role is still today one of the\nopera\u2019s most demanding. Findon gracefully assumed the position and was by\nfar the brightest star that night; he cap-tivated, enchanted, and serenaded us\nthroughout the performance. With Elizabeth Llewellyn\u2019s beautiful performance\nas Ellen Orford, the two performers gave\nus an unstoppable dynamic duo.\nMartyn Brabbins conducted the orchestra with keen skill deserving of high\npraise. The sheer size of the orchestra\nand complexity of the music would present an arduous challenge to even the\nmost seasoned conductors, yet Brabbins\nwas unwavering in his direction and\ncommand of the orchestra. Clearly Brabbins added a shining quality to the music\nin his interpretation. It is imperative that\nanyone who loves opera, and even those\nwith merely a mild interest, should see\nthis production in all its splendour; it is\nlikely that this production will not only\nbe the highlight of ENO\u2019s opera season,\nbut a highlight across their whole year.\nARTS\nArtsEditor\nGILBERT JACKSON\nRising stars\nand seaside\nserenades\nThe full cast performing.

Every year a\nbunch of schoolchildren get put in some form of mortal per-il, and every year a bunch of schoolchildren defeat the mortal\nperil with magical spells (the mortal peril is rarely treated as\nmore noteworthy than the school quidditch tournament, or\nthe house cup). Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambien is a Mexican indie com-ing-of-age comedy-drama where two foul-mouthed teenage\nboys convince a beautiful older woman to accompany them\non a drug- and alcohol-fuelled road trip to a beach (that they\nmade up), both desperate to sleep with her, and she goes with\nthem since her life had conveniently fallen to pieces the day\nbefore. Young director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n was just on the cusp of\nreleasing Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambien when he accepted the job to direct Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, on the suggestion\nof Guillermo del Toro, who politely called him \u201cfuckin\u2019 flaco\u201d\nby way of persuasion.\nThis seemed an odd choice. Chris Columbus, director of\nthe first two Harry Potter films, had a pretty standard career\nof family friendly fare like Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire. And\nthere\u2019s no doubt that he did a great job introducing the Wizarding World to the screen, laying the groundwork for the visuals of the world, and diligently guiding the acting of a cast\nof young, inexperienced actors. And the lighter atmosphere\nworked well for that cast, and that introduction. But the core\nof Harry Potter isn\u2019t the spells, nor the wizards \u2013 it\u2019s about\ngrowing up, going to school, and (as clich\u00e9 as it is) the power\nof friendship in adolescence. And, as is frequently pointed out\nwhen the books are discussed, the stories and characters grew\nup in parallel to their audience. Prisoner of Azkaban comes at\na pivotal time in the series, when the main characters enter\ntheir teenage years, and things begin to get darker, spookier,\nand a lot more nuanced. Columbus set the scene for the rest of\nthe series; Cuaron set the tone.\nThe cinematography in Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambien is great. The\ncamera is handheld and shaky, at times almost lending a documentary quality \u2013 it feels real. Deep, considered shots provide us with a very personal view of the emotions of the char-acters, and how others\u2019 actions affect them. Use of the\nclassic \u2018Dutch angle\u2019 allows us to infer more about\nthe trajectory of the scene than we are told by\nits contents. In short, the cinematography is\nconsidered and character-driven. Cuar\u00f3n\nbrought this to Harry Potter too, and the\nresult is a far more personal view of\nHarry\u2019s world. The camera shakes\nwith the movement of the train,\nmoves fluidly through mirrors\nand windows, focuses briefly\non tiny details like a quiver\nof the Womping Willow as\nit shakes off the last leaves\nof autumn. In the first two\nfilms, we\u2019re introduced to the\nWizarding World as an audi-ence. In the third film, we\u2019re\nin it. For a generation of young\nteenagers experiencing their own\nadolescent angst, this was perfect.\nThere\u2019s a semi-famous story, told in\nthe DVD extras of Prisoner of Azkaban. Before they started filming Prisoner of Azkaban,\nCuar\u00f3n asked each of the three main cast members to write an essay about their character. As the\nstory goes, Emma Watson wrote out several pages, Daniel\nRadcliffe submitted one, and Rupert Grint turned up emp-ty-handed. Give or take a few magical differences, the cast\nwere living through almost the same adolescent experience\nas their characters. And, give or take a few narcotic differences (unless you count Butterbeer), a similar one to the protagonists of Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambien. Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s experience of directing\nthe latter film in part helped him to direct the most creative\nfilm in the Harry Potter series, and one of the most emotional\nones. It paved the way for creativity in the later films too; for\nall its faults, the series has a consistent respect for filmmaking\nthat you just don\u2019t see in other similar franchises.\nOn a final note; if you\u2019re interested in further (and much\nbetter) analyses of the filmmaking triumphs to be found in\nthe Harry Potter films, the YouTube channel Nerdwriter1 has\ntwo excellent videos about Prisoner of Azkaban and the brilliant sound design evolution throughout the series.\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u001c\u001b\u0015\u0014\u001a\u001b\u0013\u0012\u001e\u001b\n\u0011\u0019\u0010\u0016\u000f\u0014\u001e\u0019\u001b\u000f\u000e\u001b \u0015 \u0015\u0014\u001b\nFILM\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001e\u0018\u0017\u0019\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001b\u0019\u0018\u0019\u0017\u0017\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u001e\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n14 | Comment 13 October 2023\ndesigning institutions that can take on\nmore students with little extra cost.\nControl refers to monitoring progress\ntowards certain targets, and thereby\neliminating degrees of freedom for students and staff. This explains the trend\ntowards attendance checks for student\ncontrol. Staff control is exercised using\nAcademic Workload Planning (AWP)\nwhich determines the exact number of\nhours for an academic working year divided in lecturing and research time.\nCalculability refers to data collection and\nusing that data for example in rankings\nwhich as we all know are ubiquitous in\nhigher education.\nPredictability refers to narrow learning objectives that do not leave room for\nfree thinking (this applies a little less to\nSTEM subjects that are taught at Imperial since they do not always have such\nopen-ended questions).\nPredictability can also be observed by\nlooking at university websites or flyers.\nThey are usually very similar in their\napproach to stylising what personality\ntraits their graduates have: innovative,\nleaders, social, global citizens, etc. Like\nMcDonald\u2019s aims to produce the same\nburger over and over, universities aim to\nproduce students sharing the same personality traits.\nThe problem is that this does not happen through the self-enlightenment of\nstudents via critical thinking but rather\nby declaring definitive university-wide\nvalues which must not be questioned,\nskipping an important step in the students\u2019 path towards becoming independent universal thinkers.\nSo why is this development not desira-ble? From a purely rational and economic\npoint of view, the new university model\nseems to be the ideal solution; more\nspecialised workers are required, and\nstudents should finish their degrees as\nquickly as possible to join the workforce\nearlier. Universities like Imperial successfully offer these kinds of vocational\ncourses the industry wants.\nOur society should not, however, be\nmeasured only by its economy, but also\nby the beliefs and ideals of individuals.\nTreating students like products coming\noff a university assembly line with certain desired traits is a dehumanising ex-perience. Assuming that this will leave\nstudents\u2019 psyches unaffected is naive.\nThe \u2018assembly line\u2019 framework does\nnot allow students\u2019 thinking processes\nto take on an individual shape. For this,\na student must quench their thirst for\nknowledge in their own way. University\nis not about knowledge for knowledge\u2019s\nsake anymore. Rather, knowledge is a\nmeans to an end. It is fuel for the econ-omy.\nThis prevents students from acquiring\nthe ability to think freely, critically, and\nindependently. While this lost potential\nof self-discovery is not important for a\nthriving economy, it is vital for a democracy of individuals.\nSo, how can universities be transformed for the better without a negative\nimpact on our dear economy?\nWhile this might be very unpopular,\nespecially at STEM universities like Imperial, the only way to enable students\nto become responsible, free citizens is by\nincluding the study of the liberal arts in\nuniversity education.\nAs John Henri Cardinal Newman said\nin his 1852 lectures on The Idea of a University, it is only by exposing students\nto the best that has been thought and\nsaid, can they obtain the ability for independent judgement. Hence, I suggest\nthat STEM courses should reduce depth\non the technical side a little and add liberal arts modules. This could be done at\nthe Bachelor\u2019s level. At the Master\u2019s level\nstudents can specialise in greater depth,\nwhich might require a Master\u2019s degree\nthat is longer than a year. To make higher\neducation affordable, tuition fees should\nbe lowered. This should be combined\nwith more freedom regarding the modules or lectures students attend so that\nthe final degree is only determined by\nwhich exams students signed up for and\npassed. (To what degree students should\nbe free to pick and choose would require\na separate discussion).\nIn this way, students still gain a technical education while also having time\nand freedom to explore who they are as\nan individual.\nImperial treats students as money banks first, and learners second. Mike Buzadji\nThe act of treating students like products that\ncome out of the university assembly line with\ncertain traits is a dehumanising experience\n\u201c\n\n"

The Office for Students requires universities to\nhave such plans if they want to charge above the basic\ntuition fee cap \u2013 which Imperial does.\nOf her four goals, Boutrolle speaks most passionately about her sustainability pledge (goal ii)). Specifically,\nshe says she wants Imperial to divest its money out of\nfossil fuel companies.\nImperial says it will continue to invest in fossil fuel\ncompanies which are striving to meet Paris Agreement\ntargets. But Boutrolle is unequivocal: \u201cWe\u2019re supposed\nto be a world-leading institution. We literally have research on the effects of climate change, and we\u2019re investing in these companies. It sends the wrong message and\ndownplays all the good work we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cYou need to lead by example when you\u2019re Imperial.\nWe need to be sending off our graduates with the right\nattitude towards climate change.\u201d\nThe College argues that its investments allow it to\nhave a longer-term influence on decarbonisation than\ndivestment would. Boutrolle dismisses this position. \u201cI\njust don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of Imperial \u2013 it\u2019s a research\ninstitution, not an investment firm. And there are better\ncompanies out there actually trying to make a positive\nchange and not just offset their use of fossil fuels. Imperial is one of only a few Russell Group universities that\nstill hasn\u2019t divested from fossil fuels \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\nBoutrolle intends to use her position as the student\nvoice in Imperial\u2019s corridors of power to show that students want change. \u201cImperial hasn\u2019t \u2013 until recently \u2013 really cared about this,\u201d she says. \u201cI do think they genuinely care about student experience, so we just need a voice\nin that room where decisions are made raising the issues\npeople want to speak about.\u201d\nShe has already started talking to environmental\ncharities, and says she will be speaking to People & Planet \u2013 the charity referenced in her goals \u2013 the following\nweek. She tells me that one easy way Imperial can move\nup People & Planet\u2019s sustainability league tables is by\nbetter reporting its existing initiatives.\nI\nt\u2019s been a steep, steep learning curve,\u201d says Boutrolle,\nwhen I ask about how she\u2019s found the role so far.\n\u201cWhen I started, I was learning not only how the Union ran, but also how the College worked, and how the\ntwo worked together simultaneously.\u201d\nThe ICU President effectively has two roles: they serve\nas the political figurehead of the student body, and also,\nas the CEO of Imperial College Union, a charity with an\nannual turnover of \u00a310m.\nBoutrolle seems to have thought extensively about\nlobbying the College, but not so much about her position\nat the head of the Union. \u201cWhen I was running, the former was definitely my view,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought of my\nmanifesto points, and then that I\u2019d get elected and figure it out later \u2013 the \u2018CEO\u2019 part is something I\u2019ve become\naware of since I started.\u201d\n\u201cThe Union\u2019s permanent staff have been very supportive in helping her with this, and have the expertise to\nhelp on the operational side of the role.\nShe says she works harder now than she did during\nher Aeronautics degree. \u201cIf I\u2019m not having any impact\nhere, it just doesn\u2019t sit right. Whereas with my degree, I\ncould be guilt free about a lot of it.\u201d\nB\noutrolle believes the biggest challenge facing the\nUnion is engagement with Imperial\u2019s international\nstudent community. Imperial\u2019s most recent annual\nreport showed that EU and international students make\nup half of the student population. Chinese students\nalone account for a quarter. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Union represents that at all,\u201d says Boutrolle. \u201cIt\u2019s two-fold: we don\u2019t\nrepresent them well because we don\u2019t get the engage-ment, but we need to work on getting that engagement,\nso that we understand how best to represent them.\u201d\nHow should the Union address this challenge? \u201cI\ndon\u2019t have a whole solution yet, but I think by leveraging people\u2019s experiences.\u201d Boutrolle notes that two ICU\nDeputy Presidents Yi Yang and Stephanie Yeung \u2013 are\ninternational students, and says she wants to use their\ninsights. \u201cI also feel bad when all international students\nare grouped into the same bucket \u2013 growing up in China\nis very different to growing up in India, which is different to growing up in Nigeria.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a business model \u2013 \u2018home versus overseas\u2019.\nWe need to understand who our students are and how\nwe can help with their issues \u2013 like are there visa issues?\nOr for example, if you\u2019re from a former colony like India, you can vote in the general election \u2013 do people even\nknow that?\u201d\nAnd finally, what would she suggest to anyone who\nwants to run for her role next year? \u201cTalk to me. You want\nto know exactly what you\u2019re signing up for, and how to\nbest prepare for that. For example, I wish someone had\ntold me what Union Council was, and that you could just\nrock up. You can just sit in, observe, and understand.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, I got scrutinised a lot on the fact that I didn\u2019t\nhave the necessary experience \u2013 especially by Felix.\nSometimes it\u2019s not about how much you know, but\nwhether you can bring the fresh perspective. It\u2019s important not to have constituent union presidents roll into\nUnion President. I don\u2019t feel those people always have a\nreal feel for what students want. Yes, I\u2019ve had to learn a\nlot in a month and a half, but now I have the knowledge,\nI can do things a bit differently.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019sembarrassing\u201d:\nICUPresident\ndeliversstarkrebuke\nofCollegefossilfuel\ninvestmentpolicy\nImperial says it invests in fossil fuel companies (FFCs) that\ndemonstrate \u2018commitment and credible action\u2019 towards the net-zero transition.\nBut Boutrolle has called for the College to divest its money\naway from FFCs. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the role of Imperial,\u201d\nshesaid.\u201cIt\u2019saresearchinstitution,notaninvestmentfirm.And\nthere are better companies out there actually trying to make a\npositive change and not just offset their use of fossil fuels.\u201d\n\u201cImperial is one of only a few Russell Group universities that\nhasn\u2019t divested from fossil fuels \u2013 it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\n"

Despite knowing these\nconsequences, BP was, until 1996, a\nmember of the Global Climate Coalition \u2013\na lobbying group which tried to discredit\nclimate science and campaigned against\npolicies to reduce greenhouse gas emis-sions.

We aim for this proportion\nto reach 50% by 2030.\u201d\nShell sponsored the Our Future Planet exhibition about carbon capture and\nstorage, which ran in the Science Museum from May 2021 to September 2022.\nChannel 4 News reported that the contract included a \u2018gagging clause\u2019, meaning the museum could not say anything\nthat damaged Shell\u2019s reputation. The\nScience Museum\u2019s Atmosphere exhibition about climate change, which closed\nin March 2022 after 12 years, was also\nsponsored by Shell.

With\na lecturing stint at Imperial spanning over 25 years, we\ncouldn\u2019t resist sitting down with him to pick his brain\nabout his field of expertise, which has this year been\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Physics .\nUltrafast physics\nProfessor Marangos characterises the length (or lack\nthereof) of an attosecond by comparing it to a human\nheartbeat. He explains that there are around \u201c1018\nheartbeats in the history of the universe\u201d and that there are\n\u201c1018\nattoseconds in one heartbeat\u201d. Attosecond science\nis vital for investigating small physical phenomena with\nimpressive resolution. These include atoms, molecules,\nand electrons in matter. This demands that photon pulses used to probe the phenomena should be on the order\nof attoseconds.\nImperial College is home to the Blackett Laboratory\nLaser Consortium, where Professor Marangos is direc-tor. The aim of the \u2018Attosecond Electron Dynamics in\nMolecular and Condensed Phase System\u2019 project is to\ninvestigate and create methods \u2013 both theoretical and\nexperimental \u2013 to probe the behaviour of molecules and\ncondensed matter.\nNobel winners\nThe first key breakthrough in attosecond physics came\nin 1987, when one of the three winners, Anne L\u2019Huillier\nand her colleagues at Lund University discovered that\nan infrared laser shone through inert, noble gases produced light that contained unusually short bursts with\nconstant intensity. L\u2019Huillier laid the mathematical\nframeworks of this effect, which set the scene for future\nresearch in refining this strange light source and probed\nits use to produce attosecond light pulses.\nMarangos explains, \u201cAnne\u2019s results really showed a\ncharacteristic phenomenon, which is this extended pla-teau. Suddenly you have this broad band light source\nwith relatively balanced amplitudes across all the frequency components. And so L\u2019Huillier was one of the\nfirst people to realise in principle that you had something you could use to synthesise a very short pulse, because the bandwidth theorem tells us that the frequency\nbandwidth, multiplied by the time duration, is limited\nby a number on the order of one. If you want to have a\nvery short time duration, you have to have a very large\nfrequency bandwidth.\u201d\nFollowing L\u2019Huillier\u2019s results, ideas in the field of attosecond pulse duration began to develop throughout\nthe 90s, with the first demonstrations of attosecond\npulse duration being intimately related to radical developments in laser technology, such as mode locking\nand light-pulse duration measurements. This made it\npossible to probe how atoms move in a molecule, and\nin particular the opportunity to study transition states\nin chemical reactions. Studying these states through ul-trafast lasers won the father of femtochemistry, Ahmed\nZewial, the Nobel for Chemistry in 1999.\nIn 2001, the two other winners, Ferenc Krausz of the\nMax Planck Institute of Quantum Optics and Pierre\nAgostini at Ohio State University both independently\ndeveloped techniques building on L\u2019Huillier\u2019s work to\nfinely produce attosecond pulses and thus control how\nlong they lasted.\n\u201cThe first demonstrations of attosecond pulse duration were pioneered both by the group of Pierre Agostini\nin France and by the group of Frank Krausz working in\nHungary. Pierre Agostini, even before Ann discovered\nhigh harmonic generation, discovered a phenomenon\ncalled Above-Threshold Ionisation, where you see electrons acquiring excess photons above the energy they\nneed to just ionize. This shows up in an electron spectrum as a series of peaks, which are closely related to the\nharmonic peaks that you see in a high harmonic spec-trum. So Agostini had already been very much a founder of the field back in the 70s. He then went along and\ndeveloped the reconstruction of attosecond beating by\ninterference of two-photon transitions technique \u2013 also\nknown as the RABBITT technique \u2013 in 2001 to confirm\nthat in ordinary high harmonic generation, you are\nmaking a train of attosecond pulses. While \u2013 what Frank\nKrausz did \u2013 really advanced laser field engineering,\ninstead of having a laser pulse that has multiple cycles\nwhich would drive a pulse train, he made a pulse that\nwas very short in duration \u2013 it had just a couple of optical cycles. The trick was then to stabilize the phase of\nthat electric field. Krausz was a master of this early on,\nNobel Prize in Physics flashes new\nglimpse into attosecond science\nSCIENCE\nScienceEditor\nTAYLOR POMFRET\nFelix talks with\nImperial\u2019s Professor\nJon Marangos to\ndiscuss Nobel-winning\nattosecond science.\nScienceWriter\nANUBHA BAL\nJILA\u2019s extreme ultraviolet (EUV) frequency comb The light source\nis a pulsed infrared laser, which is used to create a train of atto-second-long pulse bursts at EUV wavelengths.

Felix speaks to Imperial College Union\u2019s Ethics and Environment officer, Yuxi Liang, about her plans to improve\nthis ranking.\nWhy does sustainability matter to you?\nTo me it means that what we have now, we can use for\na long time and not have too much waste. I read in the\nnews about an American girl who studied environmental science, and what was the waste in her life? In four\nyears, only enough to fill a glass bottle. I think that set\nan example for me to reduce waste and recycle more\nthings in my life.\nWhat are Imperial College Union\u2019s three most unsustainable aspects, and what are your plans to\nimprove them?\n1) The canteens.\nWe can use our own coffee cup to buy coffee, but we\ncan\u2019t use our own lunch boxes to buy our lunch. One\nthing I want to do is encourage students to buy lunch or\ndinner like how we buy coffee \u2013 we can bring our own\nlunch boxes. We will see if we can reduce the price of\nfood on campus a little, because they then save on packaging costs. Another thing I want to see is if the canteen\ncan give students different portion sizes \u2013 because for\nsome, one plate of food is too much.\n2) Waste.\nI want to promote the use of digital screens instead of\npaper \u2013 but this depends on how everyone feels, because I see a lot of students want to print lecture notes. I\nwant to not only promote digitalisation, but let students\nknow how much carbon they will reduce if they reduce\nprinting. We also want to add more paper recycling bins\nand let everyone know like what kind of paper goes into\nthese bins. I will also promote the use of recyclable bags\nand bottles.\n3) Electricity usage.\nI want to reduce unnecessary lighting and power on\ncampus day and night. There are some lights where if\npeople are in the room they turn on, but if not then they\nturn off. I\u2019m not sure if these lights are in every building\n\u2013 but if this is the situation, that\u2019s good.\nCould you explain more about the \u201cstudent environmental complaint mechanism\u201d that you wish to\nimplement \u2013 how would that work?\nIf students have any ideas, send this to me. And I will say\nwhether we have enough resources to implement their\nideas \u2026 I think I plan to do this in a form, because when\nI ask something verbally then people can\u2019t think about\nit much. I have icu-environmental@imperial.ac.uk for\neveryone to send emails to me to give any suggestions or\nany changes they want to see. I also want to host events\nwith student groups and cooperate with other groups \u2013\nmaybe Imperial Climate Action. I had a chat with them\nbefore \u2013 they have lots of ideas, lots of data.\nYou mention on your Union webpage that you are a\nbig fan of travelling. Do you think the Union should\nhave a sustainable travel policy?\nI didn\u2019t think too much about this before last month \u2013\nbut now I think about this a lot. If you can choose train or\nship, you should. And have a basic plan to for the future\n\u2013 that way you can have a long trip meaning you only\nneed to travel once. I know there are some conferences\nin different places that have different dates. I don\u2019t have\na very good idea now, but \u2026 maybe I can make this more\nclever. We can save money and save carbon.\nHaveyouplannedanyCollege-wideeventsrelatingto\nenvironmental awareness or action?\nI have Sustainability Week next semester, and for this\nsemester I\u2019m still planning to do something around\nCOP28.\nAnd finally, on a light-hearted note, do you have a favourite organism? Animal, plant, or something else?\nMy favourite animals are cats because my best friend\nhas one cat.\nENVIRONMENT\n\u001f\u001e\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001c\u0017\u001d\u0016\u0015\u0014\u0013\u001c\u0012\u0011\u0010\u001c\n\u0017\u0011\u000f\u0015\u0018\u001a\u0011\u000e\u001e\u0011\u001d\u001c \u001c\u0015\u0014\u001e\u0018 \u001c \u0019 \u0015\u001c\b\u0015\u0012\u0011\u0007\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001e\u0017\u0016\u001f\u0015\u001c\u0017\u001a\u001b\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u001b\u0017\u0016\u0015\n\u001d\u001f\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u001f\u0019\u0018\u001f\u001a\u0018\u0019\u001f\u0018\u001a\u0017\u0016\u001f\u0015\u0014\u0018\u0013\u0018\u0019\u0012\u001f\n\u0011\u0010\u000f\u0010\u0019\u001b\u0017\u0010\u000e\u001b\u0019\u0010\u0018\u001a \u001f \u0019\u001f\u001b\u0017\u000e\u0018\u001f\u0017\u0012\u0019\u001f\n\u000e\u0019 \u0011\u0012\u001a\u0019\u000e\u001f \u001a\u0018\u001c\u001f \u0018\u001c\u001f\u0013 \b \u001f\n\b\u001b\u0014 \u0018\u001a\u001f\u0019 \u0012\u0016\u001f\u001c\u0010\u0017\u0017\u001f\u0014\u0012\u0011 \b\u0012\u001f\u0010\u0007\u001f\n\u0019 \u0012\u0016\u001f\u0014\u0012\u0011 \b\u0012\u001f\u0015\u0014\u0010\u001a\u0019\u0010\u001a\u000f\u0006\n\u201c\n\u001f\u001e\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u001e\u0019\u0018\u001d\u001a\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0014\u001b\u0018\u0013\u001e\u0015\u0012\u001a\u0017\u0013\u001a\u001c\u0017\u0011\u0011\u0012\u0010\u0010\u001d\u001a\u0015\u001e\u000f\u0017\u001a\u001b\u001e\u000e\u0012\u0018 \u0017\u0013\u001e\u0017 \u0010 \u001b\u0018\u0015\u0013\u0016 \u0010 \u001b\u0018\u0015\u0013\u0016\u0017\b\u0012\u0016\u0016\u001b\u0007\u001b\u0017\u0006\u001a\u0015\u0012\u001a\n\n"

She held a\nreturn offer from EY, but wanted some\nmore time to mull over things.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing people go off to do internships with these huge banks, and\nthere\u2019s this notion of associating jobs at\nthese companies with success,\u201d she tells\nme when we meet in late September. \u201cI\nwas intent on doing a gap year to sit back\nand figure things out.\u201d\nIt was around this time, Boutrolle says,\nthat she started to consider running for\na position as an officer trustee (OT) of\nImperial College Union (ICU). \u201cMy experience at Imperial was really fulfilling,\nand I don\u2019t think everyone has that, so I\nwanted to try and change things,\u201d she ex-plains.\nThe Union is run by five Officer Trustees and a team of permanent staff. The\nOfficer Trustees (OTs) are elected representatives of the student body, who take\na year out of their studies to lead Imperial\nCollege Union.\nThere are five OT positions: four Deputy Presidents, responsible for specific\naspects of the student experience, and\none Union President. The President is\nultimately responsible for the Union, and\nalso sits on College Council, meeting regularly with senior Imperial staff and acting as the voice of the student body.\nBoutrolle wasn\u2019t particularly familiar\nwith the Union, she admits \u2013 her experience of the institution was through\nImperial\u2019s sports clubs, having held committee positions on a number of them.\nThe natural role for her, given her ex-periences, was Deputy President (Clubs\n& Societies). She spoke to Dylan Hughes,\nthen holder of the position. \u201cI realised he\nwas having a tangible impact on the student experience. He really sold it to me.\u201d\nSoon though, Boutrolle realised that\nher interests didn\u2019t fall into the Clubs &\nSocieties portfolio. \u201cI came from a background in South London where I wasn\u2019t\nprivately educated, and felt quite underrepresented when I came to Imperial. I\nalso did an engineering degree with a\nvery poor female to male ratio, so outreach was something I really wanted to\nwork on.\u201d\n\u201cAlso, in my fourth year, one of my\ngood friends was heavily involved in Imperial Climate Action [ICA, a student advocacy group whose mission is \u2018to work\nwith the College to encourage sustainable policies that are environmentally and\nsocially responsible\u2019]. It opened my eyes\nto the fact this is something that isn\u2019t really going away.\u201d\nBoutrolle attended one of ICA\u2019s lunchtime meetings and was inspired. \u201cI\nthought, \u2018Yeah the Union needs someone\nwho really cares about sustainability.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI love sports and that was a huge part\nof my undergrad degree, but there were\nbigger things I wanted to change.\u201d\nAnd so, she ran for President.\nA\ns Union Presidents go, Camille\nBoutrolle is atypical. Last academic\nyear, Felix compared her resume to\nthose of her predecessors; every one of\nthem for the past six years has served as\na constituent union president (represent-ing scientists, engineers, medics or business students) before taking up mantle of\nICU President.\nThroughout our conversation, she is\ncandid about her lack of experience. \u201cI\nwas never involved in Union Council, any\nof the constituent unions \u2013 none of that. I\nwas a year-group representative one year\nfor my course, but that\u2019s about it.\u201d\nBoutrolle\u2019s inexperience is evident in\nsome of her manifesto pledges. A plan\nto make microwaves and other amenities widely available across campus drew\nridicule from some quarters; it is a stark\ncontrast to the legislative goals put forward by previous ICU Presidents. But,\nshe says, \u201cI\u2019ve got so much support for\nthe idea \u2013 Estates [responsible for College\nfacilities] are already on board.\u201d Some\nmight describe the plan as low-hanging\nfruit, but Boutrolle would likely point out\nthat she is the first to pluck it.\n\u201cPeople would still laugh at me now\nabout that,\u201d she acknowledges. \u201cBut in\nmy final year, I lived with a girl doing\na postgraduate taught degree, based\nin Hammersmith and White City. The\namenities at Hammersmith are just aw-ful. It feels like sometimes the South\nKen campus is prioritised because that\u2019s\nwhere senior management is, and I wanted to reform that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all well and good talking about\nbig things that don\u2019t affect students that\nmuch now, but what\u2019s going to make a\ntangible impact for students who are currently here?\u201d\nI\nn total, Boutrolle has four goals for the\nyear:\n1. Amenities (such as microwaves)\nreadily available across all Imperial campuses.\n2. \u2018Striving for a top-50 ranking in\nthe People & Planet league tables.\u2019\n3. Further outreach programmes to\ndiversify Imperial\u2019s population.\n4. A \u2018cross-register\u2019 scheme with\nLSE, and more IDX opportunities\n[in which students can study modules from other degree courses].\nShe admits she has overreached with\nthe \u2018cross-register\u2019 proposal, in which\nstudents at Imperial would be able to register for courses at LSE, and vice versa.\nStudents are not yet able to register for\nmodules on other degree programmes at\nImperial; Boutrolle says she needs to address this first.\nShe has also found that Imperial is al-Editor-in-Chief\nJAMIE JOHN\nIn this series, Felix talks to the\nUnion\u2019s Officer Trustees.

That is the reason that L\u2019Huillier, Agostini and Krausz\nwon the Nobel Prize for their pioneering\nwork.\u201d\n\u201cThis is something really to celebrate.\nIt shows that we are working on something that the Swedish Academy recognises as being important. I think it\u2019s\nrecognition of a broader community as\nwell.\u201d Marangos commented.\nNobel reflections\nProfessor Marangos raised a meaningful\npoint on community: physics research is\noften done in large scale with multi-col-laborative working groups. We asked\nProfessor Marangos whether the Nobel\nshould recognise these groups, rather\nthan individuals.\n\u201cIn a sense, I hope it does. Though, one\nof the things that gives it its cachet, is the\nfact it\u2019s so exclusive and so hard to win\none, and if you made it more of an award\nto a whole field it would lose that sort\nof shine. The role it plays in showcasing\nand highlighting science is significant\nenough that this current model is the one\nthat will persist. We live in an imperfect\nworld and maybe this is actually the best\nway forward with Nobel Prizes as they really do catch the public imagination.\u201d\nLike every prize, the Nobel has flaws\nand is subjective. \u201cEven in the unfairness\nas well \u2013 and let\u2019s be honest there were\nsome terrible unfairness, Anne was only\nthe third physics Nobel Prize winner in\nthe last 50 years 1973-2023 who was a\nwoman. There were two others just immediately before. In fact, Donna Strickland, who won the Physics Nobel Prize in\n2018, was the first woman to win it since\n1963, with Andrea Ghez following shortly in 2020. Nevertheless, it\u2019s good to see\nthat this sort of mental block on the part\nof the committee has been overcome.\u201d\nSir Tom Kibble, who was a prominent\nProfessor of theoretical physics at Imperial College, helped discover the Higgs\nmechanism, named after Peter Higgs\nwho won the Physics Nobel in 2013. The\nHiggs mechanism explains why particles\nhave mass. Kibble never received a Nobel\nin Physics, despite the consensus among\nhis colleagues, like Marangos, being that\nhe deserved one. Kibble\u2019s research was\nat the root of three seminal discoveries,\nincluding the Higgs Boson, that earned\nothers the prize.\n\u201cI think for many of us it was a great\ndisappointment that Tom did not win\nthe Nobel Prize. The way I\u2019d always understood it, the Higgs Boson was the\nHiggs-Kibble particle and unfortunately\nhistory moved on so quickly that some of\nthe early contributions were forgotten.\nThat happens in every field, it may have\nhappened here too. But nevertheless,\nthat\u2019s the way of the Nobel Prize. There\nare certain rules, one of which is that\nonly three people can be awarded the\nprize. So if you\u2019re the fourth person you\nwill lose out, and that\u2019s sad, but those are\nthe rules. The Nobel Prize is an imperfect\nconstruct, let\u2019s be clear. It\u2019s great that it\nexists because I think it does showcase\nandhighlightscience,butlikeeverything\nit has its flaws.\u201d\nThe Nobel in Physics was a great win\nfor the attosecond physics community,\nof which Professor Maragnos is a prominent member. Marangos personally met\ntwo of three winners, Anne L\u2019Huillier\nand Pierre Agostini, at the Attosecond\nScience and Technology symposium in\nSweden, this August.\n\u201cIt was a great symposium - it was\nquite a small gathering with only about\n30 of us giving talks. I think it highlighted how to think about the contributions\nthat were made led to the prize. Two\nof the prize winners were there. Pierre\nAgostini, I think, couldn\u2019t come because\nhe was with his grandchildren.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about the initial break-throughs. It was also about the current\nstate of the field and where it\u2019s going.\nOne of the things that\u2019s most impressive\nabout the field is how it\u2019s diversified so\nmuch in terms of the scientific problems\nit\u2019s turned its attention to. I think from\nultrafast electronics, to ultrafast chem-istry, to ultrafast quantum processes in\nmaterials \u2013 which looks like a field that\nwill continue to be very influential. In\nessence, it\u2019s about the dynamics of electrons in matter. And that\u2019s clearly an underpinning subject for so much of physical science.\u201d\n\u001f\u001e\u001f\u001d\u001c\u001b\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0018\u001c\u0015\u0014\u0013\u0012\u0011\u0010\u001c\n\u000f\u0012\u0012\u000e\u0017\u0015 \u001c\u000e\u001a\u0012\u001c \u0017\u0015\u0015\u0012 \u0018\n\u001d\u001c\u001c\u001b\u001e\u001a\u0019\u0018\u0017\u0016\u0015\u0015\u0016\u001b\u0014\u001e\u0013\u001e\u001a\u0017\u001c\u0012\u001e\u0011\u001c\u0016\u0010\u001b\u0014\u000f\u0016\u000e\nAnne L\u2019Huillier is a French-Swedish physicist, and professor of atomic physics\nat Lund University in Sweden. She is the leader of an attosecond physics group\nwhich studies the dynamics of electrons in real time, and is used to understand\nthe chemical reactions on the atomic level. Anne L\u2019Huillier obtained her PhD\nfrom the Universit\u00e9 de Paris VI in France. After undertaking postdoctoral research in Sweden and the USA, she spent the years 1986\u20131995 as a researcher\nat the French Atomic Energy Commission. She then transferred to Lund University, where she has been Professor of Atomic Physics since 1997. She works\nwith state-of-the art lasers.

He\nthen became a researcher at CEA Paris-Saclay and held positions at the University of Southern California, FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics in\nAmsterdam, and Brookhaven National Laboratory in the US. Agostini and his\ngroup first demontrated attosecond pulse duration, and doing so, disocvered\nAbove-Threshold Ionisation. Agostini has been a founder of the field since the\n1970s.

He studied theoretical physics at\nE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, graduating in 1985. After a stint as a researcher at\nBudapest University of Technology and Economics in 1988, Krausz moved to\nVienna University of Technology where he held various positions. Krausz won\nthe Nobel for his work in laser field engineering. Instead of having a laser pulse\nwith multiple cycles forming a \u2018pulse train\u2019, Krausz was an expert in making\npulses that were very short in duration \u2013 with just a couple of optical cycles.

Then we did\nthe local parkrun, some cycling and ate in\na restaurant, where we narrowly avoided\ngiving the gluten-free individual gluten.\nWe even had time for some yoga, and I\nsent a photo of us doing Savasana, a form\nof yoga, to my sister with no context.\nSummer Trip\nThen on 18th\nSeptember, 12 of us went\nto Club La Santa in Lanzarote, Spain for\nan unforgettable week of racket sports,\nbeach sports, sea\nsports and of course\u2026\ntriathlon sports. Club\nLa Santa is a sports\nresort that has every\nactivity imaginable:\nfrom an aqua party to\naqua jogging, badminton to beach volley-ball, paddle tennis and paddle boarding\n(scan the activities QR code for the weekly schedule). The beach sports also included spike ball and\negg throwing. \u201cWhat\nis egg throwing?\u201d I\nhear you ask. I shall\nleave the explaining\nto the guy in the QR\ncode video. All you\nneed to know is that Aidan and I won the\negg-throwing competition by beating\nteams of kids and their parents. Go Team\nImperial!\nMany of us tried windsurfing, without participating in the \u2018Introduction\nto Windsurfing\u2019 activity because \u201cwe\ndon\u2019t need no education\u201d. I saw that the\ntrip-goers who arrived before me had\nbeen blown a mile out by the wind; as the\ngroup leader, I should have then taken\na kayak out to rescue them, but instead\nthought \u201csilly freshers\u201d and then proceeded to also be blown out in need of\nrescue.\nEvery morning at 8am, we participated\nreligiously in the cult-like activity known\nas \u2018morning gymnastics\u2019, in which hundreds of people surrounded the leisure\npool to copy the moves of the cult leader\n(AKA \u2018Green Team Member\u2019).\nIn terms of triathlon sports, we attended morning open-water swims in the sea,\nran sessions on the track and cycled up\nand down volcanoes at speeds of up to\n86km/h, which wasn\u2019t on the risk assess-ment. On the last day, we cycled to the\nbeach for ice cream and recreated the famous running-on-the-beach scene from\nChariots of Fire (scan\nthe QR code to see the\nvideo).\nWe played all racket\nsports except for pickle ball (AKA budget\ntennis). My friend\nSteven and I played a mixed doubles\ntennis tournament in which you switch\npartners (AKA Swinger\u2019s tennis). Since\nwe had more men than women, Steven\nwas an honorary woman for the day and\nwhen he threw down a powerful serve,\nour opponents accused him of taking tes-tosterone.\nIn the evenings, we played countless\ngames of Spoons to dramatic classical\nmusic and played poker with Ritz crack-ers. By the end of the trip, we had all\ngrown closer together, despite the many\nMonopoly deal rivalries.\nNow, I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cI\ndon\u2019t like running!\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t swim!\u201d or\nI can only cycle with stabilizers!\u201d, but we\nonly ever do all three sports in sequence\nin actual triathlons! And most people\nin the club have never even completed a triathlon! So... if you want to join\na friendly society and only come for social swim (which is mostly going to the\nsauna and the union), that\u2019s fine!

The first of these\nwas Imperial College Union\u2019s \u2018Heaven\nTakeover\u2019, at the famed gay club in Westminster \u2013 the first London club night I\u2019ve\nbeen to since moving here three years\nago. I\u2019ve heard lots of great things about\nHeaven over the years, and it really lived\nup to its reputation. The venue itself is\nsmaller than expected, but with the Imperial takeover it wasn\u2019t as packed as I\u2019m\nsure it gets on its Thursday strip-show\nnights. The ability to take a breather\nwithout having to step outside is a highly underrated element of an enjoyable\nnight out. DJ guests included Karen Harding and Weaver Brothers, neither of\nwhom I knew, but both were able to keep\nenergy high and people jumping. We\nalso bumped into a fair number of other\nfourth-years who were most likely also\nsavouring their last year of freedom. The\nDJ in the upstairs room played bangers\nfrom all decades; a surprisingly good selection compared to other clubs I\u2019ve been\nto in the UK.\nAll in all, Imperial x Heaven delivered\nan excellent first London clubbing expe-rience, and was a really fun opening to\nthe rest of Welcome Week; I\u2019ll definitely\nbe back there soon!\nI also attended Decibel\u2019s first event of\nthe year (90\u2019s and 00\u2019s Bangers) in Beit\nQuad \u2013 for those who don\u2019t know, Decibel is a recurring club night hosted by IC\nRadio throughout the year, usually spanning Metric, FiveSixEight, and the Union\nBar. Again, I\u2019ve never ventured into the\nworld of Imperial clubbing prior to this\nweek, and when we arrived at 10pm \u2013\nonly a drink or two in \u2013 to a completely\nempty Metric, I feared I had been right\nto avoid it. Fortunately, things did heat\nup once a few bigger tracks were played\nin sequence.

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial Comment | 13\nISSUE #1829\nT\nhis year, my department introduced a stricter way of checking\nattendance through the use of an\napp called My Imperial Campus. It uses\nBluetooth to check whether students are\nphysically present for lectures and for\nlabs. The reason for its introduction is\nstudent well-being. Not showing up will\nmake someone reach out to you. At first,\nthis may seem like a good idea. In reality,\nthis is just one more step away from the\nprinciples on which the very first universities were founded.\nTo understand where universities are\nheading, we must investigate their past.\nThe first Western universities, founded\nin the Middle Ages, were located in Bologna, Paris, and Oxford. According to the\nNational Gallery\u2019s Glossary they taught\nthe seven liberal arts: grammar, logic,\nrhetoric (the core subjects known as the\ntrivium), arithmetic, geometry, astrono-my, and music (quadrivium). These were\nnamed the \u201cfree\u201d arts (from the Latin\nword liber, meaning free) because learning about them made students free, independent individuals.\nThe next big step was the German university reform in the early nineteenth\ncentury. It was initiated when Wilhelm\nvon Humboldt, an educational theorist\nand philosopher, set up the Berlin University. For the first time, the concept of\nlecturers who were equally important as\nresearchers was introduced. Moreover,\nstudents were granted a lot more freedom to engage with the topics they were\ninterested in, all centred on the liberal\narts and classics. At a time when French\nuniversities were heavily restricted by\nthe state, this line of thinking was revo-lutionary, and was later adopted by most\nuniversities.\nBy this time, the age of industrialisation had begun. It had big consequences for the workplace and the structure\nof society. Over time, more and more\nskilled workers were required. A process\nof specialisation started, which would\nlater trickle down to universities. We realise this very clearly when comparing,\nfor example, the degree of specialisation\nbetween subjects such as electrical engineering and the seven liberal arts.\nThe other development brought on\nby industrialisation was the creation of\na growing middle class that could afford\nhigher education. According to The New\nStatesman, in the 1970s and 1980s about\n15% of students went to university while\nmore than half do now (50% of people\nbetween the ages of 30 and 34 have a de-gree).\nSo, how have universities changed\nover this period? In the UK, the transformation began with the Jaratt report from\n1985. The British university system is\nknown for treating universities as com-panies, and students as customers. From\nthere, it derives how universities should\nbe optimized. This development is exactly what sociologist George Ritzer predicted when introducing the term McDonaldization (for those interested, read\nBeyond McDonaldization \u2013 Visions of Higher\nEducation, edited by Dennis Hayes, which\napplies the concept of McDonaldization\ndirectly to education). Ritzer states that\nrationalisation and economisation processes will eventually transform all aspects of our lives according to the principles of businesses like McDonald\u2019s:\nefficiency, control, calculability, and pre-dictability.\nThese have led to the new university\nstructures, as they enable massification\nand increase benefits for the economy. Efficiency in the case of universities means\nCOMMENT\nWhy university\neducation\nshould be\nreformed \u2014 and\nhow to do it\nThis is just one more step away from\nthe principles on which the very first\nuniversities were founded.\n\u201c\nImperial takes a page out of Orwell\u2019s\nbook with recent developments Students will be severely detrimented by Imperial\u2019s approach Elif Civelekoglu\nCommentWriter\nCONSTANTIN KRONBICHLER\n\n"

    "content": "felixonline.co.uk | felix@imperial.ac.uk | @felix_imperial\n12 | Environment 13 october 2023\nI\nn an announcement by PM Rishi Sunak on Thursday\n5th\nOctober, the UK government is planning to combat\nnicotine addiction with a law stating that \u201cchildren\naged 14 or under this year can never legally be sold cigarettes in their lifetime\u201d. The government aims to implement this by increasing \u201cthe age of sale\u2026by one year\neach year\u201d from 2027. This means that in 2027, the legal\nage for buying cigarettes will become 19, in 2028 it will\nbecome 20, and so on. If the ban is successful, it might\nalso prove to be a win for the environment in the long\nrun \u2013 discarded cigarette butts are claimed to be the\nmost littered single-use plastic product in the world.\nTwo major criticisms of the policy proposal are the\npossibility of it perpetuating the illegal trade of cigarettes and other tobacco-based items on the black market and that it takes away people\u2019s freedom to choose\nwhether or not to smoke.\nSunak also mentioned plans for discouraging vape\nuse among younger generations \u2013 particularly school-children. Vapes are heavily targeted towards young\npeople, with their bright colours and various flavours.\nProposed regulatory procedures for this include restrictions on where vape products can be displayed in stores\nand restrictions on targeted marketing.\nOn the same basis as Sunak\u2019s newly announced smoking policy, the potential for a ban on single-use vapes\nwas floated around by multiple major news outlets last\nmonth. Ultimately the policy didn\u2019t come to fruition.\nOne challenge in banning single-use vapes is their usefulness for smokers who are trying to transition away\nfrom cigarettes. Many students probably also wouldn\u2019t\nhave been happy about the ban, but it would have proven beneficial to the health (and wallets) of those who\nonly purchase the disposable version of the product.\nBanning disposable vapes would have similar environmental benefits to banning cigarettes. Vapes contain\na variety of materials (plastics and metals) that cannot\nbe recycled together and that have extremely slow degradation rates. Some of the electronic materials could\nlast longer than a vape pen is used for and might be\nbetter utilised in products with longer lifetimes. Additionally, vapes leach a myriad of waste products on dis-posal; microplastics from the casing, heavy metal lithium from the battery, and carcinogens, not only toxic to\nhumans but to lots of other wildlife, not to mention the\nnicotine itself. On several occasions I\u2019ve seen vapes left\nin the grass in Hyde Park and on pavements \u2013 both toxic\nand a visual blight.\nThis summer, many music festivals implemented\nsingle-use vape bans in efforts to protect the lands being used and adjacent environments. This sounds great\nin theory, and some vapes were confiscated upon entry\nto these festivals, but \u2013 at least at Glastonbury Music\nFestival \u2013 bag checks weren\u2019t nearly thorough enough\nto be effective. It should also be noted that at Glastonbury, single-use vape pens could still be purchased at\non-site stalls along with biodegradable wet wipes (wet\nwipes were also on their list of banned items, for environmental reasons). These products join the collection\nof discarded items that get left on the grounds by fes-tivalgoers for clean-up crews to deal with. The fields\nthat hosted these events probably remain littered with\nsingle-use vapes \u2013 that is, if they haven\u2019t been washed or\ncarried into neighbouring ecosystems. A country-wide\nban might be the only way to ensure this doesn\u2019t continue to happen at future events.\nThe cigarette policy is a slow-moving one; it won\u2019t\ntake effect for another four years and is already facing\npublic resistance and criticism. However, it appears to\nbe a solid step in the right direction. I only find it unfortunate that this assertion doesn\u2019t seem to extend to policies solely focused on environmental protection; perhaps a more poignant human health risk is necessary\nto warrant decisive action from ministers? Regardless,\nprogress is progress, and the planet will appreciate all\nthe wins it can get, however major or minor.\nHe\u2019s not all bad: Sunak\npushes through anti-smoking policies\nDeputyEditor\nZANNA BUCKLAND\nStay tuned! Next week I plan to discuss in more\ndetail the implications and reasoning behind\nSunak\u2019s rolling back of climate-forward policies.\nmore\u2026Wecontinuetourgecompaniesincarbon-intensive sectors to show more leadership in speeding\nup the transition to low-carbon energy sources.\u201d\nWhat resistance have the partnerships\nfaced?\nOver the last four years, activists have protested at\nthe Science Museum over its fossil fuel partnerships.\nFor example, UK Student Climate Network spent\nthe night in the Science Museum in October 2021,\nand Extinction Rebellion put up a banner inside the\nmuseum during the Great Exhibition Road Festival\nearlier this year. Recently, 100 people from Climate\nChoirs walked through the Science Museum, singing\nin protest of fossil fuel sponsorships. These demonstrations have been supported by resignations of two\nof the Science Museum Group\u2019s trustees and vocal\ncondemnation from former UK Chief Scientific Advisor Sir David King. Speakers have also pulled out\nof the Science Museum\u2019s \u2018Climate Talks\u2019 series over\nthese partnerships.\nIn 2021, academics and science communicators\nsigned an open letter pledging not to work with\nthe Science Museum until the controversial sponsorships are dropped. Dr Dave Clements, Reader in\nAstrophysics at Imperial and one of the signatories\nof the open letter, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d\nin the Science Museum. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that ... the current management and board of directors are more\nworried about money than, frankly, the science\u201d Dr\nClements said. \u201cDespite being asked to contribute to\n[a recent Science Museum exhibition], I could not\nbecause they have not changed their policy on spon-sorship. I would advise all my colleagues to withdraw\ntheir support from similar events and tell the Science\nMuseum why.\u201d\nThe Science Museum is one of the few remaining\nBritish arts institutions that still partners with the\nfossil fuel industry. The British Museum, Royal Opera House, and National Portrait Gallery all ended\ntheir partnerships with BP earlier this year. In 2019,\nRoyal Shakespeare Company terminated BP\u2019s initiative to provide subsidised tickets to young people\nwanting to see their plays.\nScience Museum, Exhibition Road. Shadowssettle\n\n"
