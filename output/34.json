    "content": "pRo rik In the middle of the year1921 in the mining community of Morro Velho., Brazil, John the son of an old R.S. M. student, received his first impressions of this wicked world. Eighteen months la'ter he brought his parents back to England. He was weaned on water,( and later beer) buttered toast, and chocolate biscuits, for all of which he still shows a remarkable affinity. As soon as he was old enough he was sent to school atE well Castle, where Eventually he gained a cap for cricket and colours for swimming. His first experience of the river and the noble art came while he was at the Poly work ir% forMat ric. Some two years later, in1941, having the idea that he would make\na good chemist, he appeared at R.C.S. among the First Year Specials. At the end of that session he was persuaded that Botany would be more in his line, and in January19*45 his advisers were proved correct. He now serves that department under the mystical title of\" Lecturer in Timber Technology\" and is rumoured to be growing a new forest of Eir nam on its roof. His association with the Lo at^ lub began in his first days at college and is still one of his strongest ties with the extracurricular aspect of college life. as a cox he gained his I.C. and R.C.S. Full Colours in his first year at college and in the two subsequent seasons. tie was also captain of R.C.S. Boat Club for two years and Vice U apt a in of x.u. B.C. in19434 when the l st VIII went ne ad of the \u201e iver for the first time. FELIX\nTHE ADMIRA(B)L(E) JOHN LEVY on graduating he joined Thames . . owing Club where he cox ed for a further four seasons and was joint Honorary secretary from1948 to195 u. Thus it is easy to see why he will talk\" rowing\" at the slightest provocation.* t present he has temporarily retired from active co xing, but still gives a weekly talk to the I.C. Coxswains' Society and may\nbe seen taking a keen interest in the R.C. S.crews during the Christmas term and in the I.C. crews after the Morphy. One of his proudest possessions is a personal tankard given to him by the Boat Club in1944 as a token of their appreciation of his efforts( probably invective!) In October1949 he came to reside in the Hostel and was immediately elected Chairman of the Residents' Committee, which office he held successfully until late in1951, several months after he had moved\nto a bachelor flat in Notting Hill. Meanwhile his services had been secured as Vice chairman of the Refectory committee an onerous post which he still holds and which automatically makes him a member of the o a ie ringo ub committee. i hus it may be seen that John has interested himself in many spheres of life at college in all of which he has acquitted himself most ably. in addition to these many responsibilities he finds time to run a some nh. t temperamental car.nis first was a1934 Armstrong oid de ley whose starter motor used to rouse the Hostel at many an odd hour. For Over two years now, however, he has been the proud owner of COP 1 0 7 and many of us have reason, to be grateful to him for his late night honorary taxi service. His frequent appearances at Carnivals in nautical rig have earned him the title of\" ADMIRAL\" and the many bo'suns at present in residence often remember to pipe him aboard whenever he visits the Flagship. His association with the College already extends over a number of years. Let us hope that it will continue and will be as successful in the future as it has been in the past. I CW A. DINNER Those of you who managed to get on the right side of a member of I. C.W. A. will have appreciated the excellent dinner which they provided on Friday March 7 th. Their distinguished visitor this year was Demo Ninwtte\nde Valois, Director of Sadler sWells Ballet Company, who in replying to the toast of \"The Guests\" expressed her pleasure at being invited as a representative of the Arts( and ballet in particular) to speak to a group of young scientists. The\ntoast had been proposed by the Secretary, Miss Bslmage,T( ho in welcoming the guests managed to get in a few digs at Union\nofficers present. Mr. Jack Howarth in proposing the toast to the association, proved to everyone's satisfaction that the dissolution of I. C.W. A. was unnecessary.\nSeveral entertaining incidents from the early history of I. C.W. A. were remembered by the President, Miss Gra twi ek, in her reply. She also mentioned in her speech the achievements\nof present members, of whose contribution to the academic;,\nsocial and athletic activities of the College was not inconsiderable The standard of speeches was generally considered to be high and the informal dance afterwards was enjoyed by every-GU/LDS' TIES\nAfter discussion at two meetings, the report of a subcommittee and the deliberations of their Union Committee, the Guilds' have decided not to change the pattern of their ties. At first several alternative schemes bearing shield designs\nin reds and blues were considered^ and later it was suggested\nth\u00ab[t the present issue was unsatisfactory only in its exact\nshade of colour and in the quality of the cheapest material. It wa finally decided yesterday week that the Books tall be\nasked to cease stocking the rayon tie, so that future purchasers\nwill only be able to get ties which will last. The colours, used since1906 for the present tie, are common to many of the City and Guilds' associations as well as here t and this and the feeling that a tie in use for o yer forty years should not be o hanged, were some of the reasons in opposition to a new design. news\" !N BRIEF\n\"Haasaersaith Bridge Closing for Repair\"( Evening paper).

    "content": "6 FELIX ROWING The Head of the River Rao e over the Boat Rao* o our sein the reverse direction, i.e. from Hort lake to Putney, owes its origin to Steve Fal rb air n, who\ninstituted the race in1986. Of this rao e he was\nto write that it would\" do more for rowing than any!thing has 'done yet.\" By1930, eighty or ews were racing and this number has steadily Increased, until today over200 or ews are Involved, some in\" test\" boats and the others in Clinkers. London R.C. were winners of the first rao e in1986 and apart from sharing the Head ships with Tha mes\nR.C. the following year, remained unsurpassed for ten years. Until the war, with the possible exception of the Cambridge University( Goldto) B.C. in1938, no college ere w had ever rowed Head although the two Cambridge Colleges, Jesus and Pembroke, had both come\nnear doing so. That honour was reserved for the I. C.B.C. who went Head in1946, beating Jesus, who\nreversed the posit t on the following year and were to win again in1951. The I. C.B.C. has been one of the s tau no he st supporters of the Rao e, entering some 8 to10 crew sea oh year( a record beaten only by Thames R.C.).T or many years both l stand2 nd TII I's were in the Fist Division and on one memorable ooo as ion, the3 rd and4 t heights as well. In1950, however, the l st Til leo ul d only finish29 th, which position was again oo eu pio d last year. It is to be hoped that they will be atleast ten places higher J. n1952_..J This year, the race w lil be rowed on Saturday,82 nd March, and the first eight crews of the I. C.BC. will be rowing the4 i miles. The l st VIII starting in the lowly position of29, aim to finish mu oh higher. If they row at their best, they may well do this, for having rowed some 4 0 0 miles during the term they should not be lao king in either fitness or hard work. They tend to be slow with their hands at the finish, which leads to unsteadiness in the sliding forward and a snatch at the beginning. Having seen the film of themselves taken on the return trip from Staines, these faults may well be more easily eradicated now that each man knows what he looks like. Should the l st VIII do well, not a little of the credit will be due to the fine spirit of the seo on d VIII, who have never stinted themselves in their efforts to make the First boat go faster. They may\nnot be fast enough to reach the First Division, but it will not be for want of trying. Of the lower boats, all that need be said is that they are engaged in their own private battles, ff he the rit be the3 rd VIII fighting to go from68 to58, or the8 th VIII from205 to195. Good luo k to them all'. CIRCUMFERENCE1 CAPTAIN OF THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE BOAT CLUBft -.ft- mAL IT b'y Though the office of Captain of the Boat Club is much sought after, it Is by no means an easy position to hold. Oarsmen are not the most quick witted and precise of mortals, an a the weekly job of arranging100120 of them into some tenor so eights is a time consuming and unenviable task. These ten eights have to be put into suitable boats; coaches must be found for each or ew; times of outings must be arranged; vacancies have to be filled and substitutes conjured from now'here at the last minute without undue disturbance of the lower crews. The coaches he appoints are his official advisers, but he is also surrounded by numerous well meaning or near hostile critics who . are prepared to shower him with unsolicited advice on all and every occasion. The man who has to s it at this thorny thwart this year is Peter( Paul) Maltby, a student of mining, who\nis only in his second year a tI.C. Though young in years, he is wise and knowledgeable in rowing matters, having learn this rowing at Bedford School and possessing two uncles who were very closely connected with the successes of Pembroke College, Cambridge and the London R.C. in their\" great days\" of the late twenties and thirties. With this accumulation of rowing experience, knowledge of crews and clubs, of coaches and styles, of oarsmen and arguments, the I. C.B.C. may regard themselves lucky indeed to have their destinies in such capable hands. He combines this rowing background with, an unassuming and modest disposition. Knowing his hopes and fears for the result of the Head of the River, the hard work, thought and worry that have gone into making the l st VIII go well let us Just say\" Good luo k. Have a good row, Peter\" SOCCER TECHNOLOGY COP, FINAL. Ra G \u00ab\u00a3\u00bb \u00bb 0 . Si 0 . 1.\nrl.C.3 Y, having beaten Mines6.0 in the previous match, qualified to play C.&G. in the final of the Technology Cup on Wed,5 th. March. The ground cond it it ions were perfect for football, but there was as light breeze blowing down the pitch. Guilds kicked off into the wind... and there were some early raids on both goals. K.C. S. soon settled down to some good football and it was\nobvious that they were out to avenge their defeat by Guilds early in the season. The Guilds goal was under \u2022/\ngreat pressure at this time. In one of the many raid so tone broke through ai.d gave the goalkeeper no chance with a powerful left foot shot. Guilds fought back but were soon two in arrears, Pin sent shooting a very nice goal. Shortly afterwards two Guilds men were involved. in a collision and one had to leave the field to have stitches inserted in a cut above his eye. The remaining oui lds men fought on gamely and there was no dh ange in the score when the whistle blew for halftime. The second half resolved itself into a ding dong battle, both teams having their spasms of attack and defence. The Guilds were next to score, a high lobby R. Wheeler deceiving the goalkeeper. Guilds continued I to press for an equalise ran dR. Wheeler hit the J crossbar with along range drive. The issue was\n!\nsettled when Wardle ran on to across from the right and gave the goalkeeper no c nance from close range. The final whistle went soon after and R.C.S. had won\nthe Cut fo*-the third successive ye_ar. Credit for the victory does not go to any one\nman - R.C.S. played as a team but mention must be\nmade of the captain, Buck ri yd, who set a fine example to his team, and C len shaw, who was the star of the forward line.. BOXING j.C. BOXING CHAMPIONSHIPS.\nThe Boxing Championships were again a eu oo ess, but the\nlack of support tern Guilds rather spoiled the event as an\ninter college competition. R.S. M. with a combination of enthusiasm and skill won the trophy. RESUHT, R.S. M.40.R.C. S.21.C.*G.5. LIGHT IIKU'KHMEIGHT. G. GAUSS ( R.C.S.) certainly wasted no\ntime against J. SHARPIEY (R.S.

One of the most punishing bouts seen a tI.C. for some time was that between J. DAVIES (C.4G.) and\nB. FENOuTLHET ( R. S.M.).A strong finish by the experienced\nGuildsman enabled him to snatch a close points decision from\nthe exceptionally game Miner. HEAVHaEiGffl'. The contest between J. IACEY (R.S. M.) and P. KIDDIE\n(R.S. M.) provided the audience with some amusement.IACEY won\na slew moving fight on points, LIGHT MTDDUSffEBfflT. Arousing display by R. FORSCKER ( R.S. M.) and R. APPIEBY (R.S. M.) provided an exciting finish to the\nevening's boxing. FORSCKER gained a narrow points verdict. The Rector presented the Inter College Cup toP. EBSWORTH\n( Captain. R.S. M.) and the tankard for the winner of the best\nfight toR. FORSCHER. t FENCING I. C.v Cambridge Cutthroats away. Drown 13-13.\nOn Saturday March l st,I.C. succeeded in drawing the 'match against the Cambridge 2nd team on the last hit of the\nlast fight. Owing to delays in the arrival of various members of the\nCambridge team the match was fought in the order of Epee,\nSabre, Foil, instead of the usual Foil, Epee, Sabre.( It should\nbe explained' that the Foil and Sabre styles require considerable activity and it is generally the custom to separate them\nby the e om par it iv ely restful Epee.) I.C. vers slew in getting their eye in and were soundly defeated in the Spec 6-2\n( there being ene double loss). The Sabre was won 5-4, but\nin spite of this the chances of making up any lost ground in the Foil seemed remote.\nThe Cutthroats had a varied and somewhat un convent i al foil side Lemante, fighting with an Italian foil and Italian style Maeklup, energetic and Polish Phe in ester, more conventional but a stone waller. Lemante, whose age and experience\nwere shown by his perfectly timed stop thrusts, defeated all the I.C. team. Maeklup, although persistent In attack, was\ninaccurate. Phe in ester stonewalling was eventually overcome\nby A ln s ley by use ef the one-two - by To pl is by the cut ove rand by Bri stove by sheer hard work. The Foil was won 6 - 3 ,\nresulting in a draw e f13all.A count of hits revealed that this was also a draw e f46all. Published by the FELIX Board, Imperial College TJnidn, j London, S.W.7.

    "content": "mu x SPORTING TROPHIES Mention of Union Trophies brings to mind one\nof two thoughts. The* Adonis of the playing fields thinks of the silver o ups and shields displayed in the trophy oases; the rag commando thinks of the Spanner and the Bru mot f some re lie of the Science Exhibition. There exist in I.e.a group of trophies which fall into neither of these categories and which, in away, are of greater worth than either. They, are the international trophies presented to the sporting clubs of the college by their overseas counterparts. In1948 a party of Scandinavian students working in this country under the I.C. vacation work scheme presented the beautifully carved viking ship which is displayed in the bar. The\nblue and white china vase which rests inside it bears on its base the inscription^\" To the rugby team of Imperial College from Delft S.S.C., January1948\". In the same year the I.C. Rug ger Club visited Delft and left be hlf lda tankard which is now used by the President of the Delft Students Rugby Club during his year of office. The coloured tiles mounted on the bar wall behind the viking ship were also brought over by the Delft students. Last year the I.C. Athletic Club visited Denmark and brought back the figure of D iseo bal us surmounted by the Danish flag which is now displayed in the trophy case in the Old Lounge. It was presented at an international event in which the I.C. team represented England. Bu ring the last G hr is tm as vac. the Delft R.F.C. again visited us and presented the tin ashtray which resided on the trophy shelf in the bar and which exhibits the\" tin cry\" beloved of all metallurgists. The much publicised game\nbetween I.C. and the Thai Rugby Union touring:.' side was followed by a dinner at which a pennant bearing the arms of the Thai Rugby Union was\npresented to\" I.C. This is now displayed in the trophy case in the Old Lounge. For a few hours on Thursday last the case was emptied of its sporting relics and held the wreath sent by Imperial College and the combined constituent colleges to Windsor for the funeral of the late King George VI. Although members of I. C.W. A. get no opportunity to see the trophies in the bar,a word in the ear of any of the men folk will doubtless bring those trophies from their place of honour to be admired by all concerned. Such trophies are of great value to the college. They not only revive memories, but they also remain as evidence of the strong international ties which bir i dI.C. with the continent, and which enhance our name in so many towns and cities overseas. POL. SO C.P.P. From Our Political Society Correspondent Students a tI.C. have an opportunity of hearing, learning and questioning the polio y of each of the three political parties, but due to the usual I.C. apathy do not appear to take it. The three groups of the Political Society, Conservative under H.._ Gr igg Liberal under K.M aron, Socialist under S. Ru he man, exist for this purpose, but the actual attendance of each group is too disheartening to set down in FELIX. Sufficient to say that even on paper the total member\nship of the Political Society is less than50, of which not20 are active. The Socialist group, the largest, is the most a otl ve, having during the term held several lu noh hour discussions. The subjects included the proposed\" Education Cuts.\" A lecture on \" Soviet Sisre\nLabour\" was given by C.A. Smith. Both S. L.F. and N. A.L.S.O. want the group to join them and this matter is being discussed. Future plans include a speech on \" The British Youth Peace Festival\", talks by various M.P.'s, and regular lunch hour discussions The Conservatives hold regular lunch hour discussions and plan to hold them In the future. No\noutside speaker can be asked to address the group as at present there is Insufficient support. The Liberal group is the smallest and although not yet dead is almost so. At present only di sous s lons and talks with other College Liberal Soo iet les are held. It is., to be hoped that the future will brin \u00ab\nnew members and greater^ activity to all three groups.

W.') MUS/C NOTES\nFrom Our Music Correspondent The past fortnight has3 een such a varied and interesting number of events that it is only possible to report each one in a limited manner. Taken in chronological or d sr the first item was the Inter College Society concert given on Tuesday the26 th,in the R.C.M. concert hall. The music varied from Mozart to Delius and Sibelius, and a very enjoyable evening was had by\nthose present, not be eu as e of heights of perfection reached\nin the performances, but rather, because of the enthusiasm\nof the performers, which gave each work life. The audience\nwas adequate, but not nearly enough support was given by any\nof the o on st it u ent call ages. Were it not for the pre sen oe of, I presume, parents and staff, the hall would have bees\nhalf empty. '\nThe Thursday concert on the28 th was given by Erie Greene,\naccompanied by Mie ha el Mull inar.A song cycle written in i gypsy vein by Dvorak started the show, but the main event was\nthe performance of a new group of songs by Bernard Stevens,\nthe composer being present. In these the harmonic vocabulary\nwas perhaps rather limited, but nevertheless, the spirit of the poetry was well caught and w \u00ae can hope for, great things from Mr. Stevens.\nSir Steuart Wilson was the guest of the Musical Soeiety\non the following day, whoa he gave at ali on Opera in England.\nIn this he laid stress on the practical difficulties of production and finance. Thursday the6 th saw the50 th Thursday Concert and to mark it a concert performance of Acts I and H of the Marriage\nof Figaro was given. The attendance was of the order \"House\nFull\" and before the music, Mr.Toombs was presented with same\nbooks in recognition of his work in inaugurating and organising the come rts. The real business of the meeting provided\nf of an hour of pure delight. There was neither scenery nor costumes, but by the deft touches of musical and facial expression the singers took us right out of the20 th century\nand Guilds Board room into the time of Da Font s'sB park ling story of court intrigue.

The opinions it raises very from downright\ncondemnation to moronic effusion. To a certain extent\nboth viewpoints are understandable! a well produced, well acted amateur play can equal or even surpass many repertory theatre productions, while on the other hand some amateur\nplays can invoke only feelings of nausea.\nHow should an amateur production be judged? All too often established theatrical standards are ignored, and a downright bad production tolerated on the grounds - \" well, they are only amateurs.\" I cannot condone this view at all. If a play is to receive a public performance it should be fit to be judged on its achievements.\nAdmittedly, the back stage equipment of the gym is rather less adequate than that of Drury Lane, and one can not expect to find Olivier a in the Engl rae s ring Department,\nor Margaret Leokwoods taking Zoology! allowances should be\nmade, but not excuses. The person who misses his cues, or forgets his part is not only a liability to the cast, but en\ninsult to the audience.\nThe forthcoming production of \"Thunder Rook\" should prove\nto be of considerable interest. It, is not an easy play to put on, and the Dramatic Soeiety will have no little diff leu tr in maintaining its present reputation.11.50 p m.22.2.52..A.de G.F Shaw, "

Queen Mary College were defeated by3 pt B tested and eso it ing game. THE REWARD OF BARB WORK t The match was played in sunshine, on soft turf, With very little win d.I.e. early revealed a smoothness at halfback which promised well and the three quarters carried out several good passing movements. The forwards, the engine of victory in previous rounds, settled to their task of subduing the q.U. c. pack, but this proved a hard business. Up to halftime there was no balance of advantage to either side. After the changeover the cohesion and power of the I.e. forwards began to tell and play went repeatedly into Q. M.C's \u2022 2 5 ' . After some minutes. of especially intense pressure the reward came. A hasty pass back behind the goal line was knocked on by a defender and Brian Robins joined the company of immortals b> seizing the ball for the touchdown. Knox just failed with a fine kick from wide out. Q.M. C. were not done with but their sporadic attacks were foiled by excellent defence. I.C.'s forwards, well supported by tactical kicking from halves and backs, were now on top, and several times there was almost a second score before the final whistle went. At this signal of triumph Jack How or th was borne to the stand to receive the long sought trophy from Dr. Logan, the Principal of the University, and the congratulations of the Rector and Lady Hill. The match was good to watch and very few penalty kicks had to be given. The\nI.C. side rose splendidly to the occasion and deserve congratulation, some of which must be save u for those who played in earlier rounds but could not do so at Mot spur Park because there are only15 men\nin a team. ASAD BLOWUP For eighteen mon thE Mr. Peter Walker of the Chemical Engineering Department has been perfecting an apparatus to investigate the\" Condensation of Mixed Vapour s\". On Wednesday, 5 th March, he completed its calibration. On Thursday the6 th it erupted into a fountain of flame, fragments of glass and molten aluminium. Warning of the explosion was received about a minute before it occurred at1.10 p.m. when mercury in mano meters began to rise steadily in one\nlimb and fallin the other, and a Bourdon Gauge\nrose smartly from nought toten atmospheres. When opening certain valves failed to check this phenomenal rise in pressure, Mr. Walker and the four others in the lab. at the time evacuated themselves in the reasonable expectation that they were about to witness the explosion of5 gallons of liquid oxygen attached to the apparatus. In fact a single separate gallon of liquid oxygen burst its large Dewar as fire destroyed all wooden and plastic parts and melted some of the supports.> Resolute treatment with foam fire extinguishers saved the5 gallons and rendered the fire engine's visit unnecessary. Two extinguishers were employed in putting out an electric lightbulb incorporated in a thermostatic control circuit, which was frantically y going on and off in a fit of cybernetic frenzy. Mr. Walker's apparatus was completely destroyed and books, clothing and other apparatus suffered from foam. A researcher's life is largely made up of hope deferred. FELIX extends his sympathy to Mr. Walker. AC.C. LOCKERS Four look ers behind the gymnasium have been set aside for ICU. members when changing for games. The keys are kept\nin the messengers' off Joe. Members using these look ers will asked to sign for keys, and they are requested to be especially careful to return borrowed keys. Anyons failing to do\nso will be liable to a fine. MINES ELECTIONS Election of the Mines Officers for the19523 session took place at a far from quiescent Annual General Meeting held on Friday7 th March. Of the numerous posts filled, only four will be\nconsidered here, namely, those of President, VicePresident, Secretary and, of course, Pornographer! Until a day before the elections took place, four candidates had been proposed and seconded to fill the post of President. These were: G. Cox, A. A. Greenfield. W.A. Gardner, and M. Martin. Finally, with the approach of zero hour, the name of W.S. Robinson was added to complete an already interesting field. At the meeting itself, both Mike Martin and Geoff Cox withdrew, thus leaving three candidates, and Bill Robinson was elected President with acclamation. G. Cox, A. A. Greenfield, W.A. Gardner, J.R. Lacey, P. D.R. Molt by, M. Martin and G. W.W or s fold all stood for the post of VicePresident, Geoff u ox being duly elected. \u2022Of the two candidates ID. Fraser andR. J.(ji sales deP ury) standing for election to the exacting post of Secretary, Don Fraser was chosen to undertake this task. The post of Pomo graph er, held, despite ail fresher s, for the last three years by P.K. Hall, was entrusted toP. Andrews whom it is felt certain will carryout this job in true Mines' tradition,, FIFTY FIVE FIGHT TO FINAL.\" Richmond College beat Goldsmiths' in the final of the\nU.L. U. Debating Contest. The judges average marking was 7 3 -71. The debate was broadcast on the Third Programme, the un mistake able voice of Derek Coomber coming over loud and clear, The unseen motion was that' This House Prefers a Knave to a Foolj and was lost by 99-206; this audience vote was not a part of the contest. There are only 55 students at Richmond, and this was\ntheir first entry into the contest. They beat King's College, three times winners since the war. Goldsmiths' beat IC. in the first round. These, and other general fa ots about U.L. U. were given in a well informed commentary by the B.B.C. during the voting. \u2014 \u2014\nU.L. U. DEBATE.OK AFRICA\nA very small audi sn ce of under fifty was present at the\nU.L. U. debate on Africa. It was a great pity that the other\n99,8*\u00a3 of the student body failed to find anything of interest in a subject which is of great importance to this oo un try.S uprising ly, even the coloured students failed to turn up In force. The arguments for and against wore well presented by Mr.\nFennsr Broekway, M.P. seconded by a student from the Gold Coast and by M r.G.B. Craddoek M.P. seconded by a British student. The motion calling on the Government to announce\ntarget dates for the handing over of A frio an government to the native population was carried by twenty-one votes to five with nine abstentions. "

    "content": "FELIX\n' THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE EDITORS S.B. WEARHE\nA Viewpoint Summary Spring Term1952 A new\" year dawns' mid shortages and ice, And readers of our magazine prepare To masticate that choice and biting spice Which Viewpoint writers like the world to share. Alas l the final issue of the term Hot from the presses, flutters in our hands And any careful reader will confirm How sadly they have sated our demands I Our intellectual organs have brought forth not melody, But three discordant trumpet blasts, set in a ghastly key. FIRST BLAST: Come, leave dull conventions of dress to the timid and old. You' re young and you' re free, and by God you' ve a right to be bold. So purge all the serge from the landscape, the black from the scene, And baskin the brightness of purple and orange and green. SECOND BLAST: The way that you talk makes me worried and very ashamed. You' ve no ear for music, you' ve no eye for art and it's claimed That two hundred words( all you know) aren't enough, broadly viewed,, For half are too technical, most of the rest are too rude. THIRD BLAST: The trouble with you Is that all your Ideas are dead. Oh, where Is the anarchist, alchemist, fascist and red? Your atrophied brains are just sponges to soak up the dope That Mammon calls Science. Be critic all The relies your Hope. THE BROWN BAG GER'S REPLY: You make a noble fanfare with your brass, But save it for your castles in the sky. These badly timed diversions won't help pass Th' exams which loom so menacingly nigh. Ioan' t afford to buy those clothes which grow Distasteful when their honeymoon is gone. I cannot spare the time to get to know\nThose tricks which help to deck the social swan. I've seen too many crazy, stupid creeds To be attracted by the raging flood Of politics. I know what dreadful deeds Idealists like yourselves can wreak with blood. The weight of word3s hall not encumber me.I make them serve my god, Utility. Final Chorus: GRAND STUDENT ANTHEM.\nGaudeamus Ig it ur Gone, alas', the days of yore. In the times to come must we\nLead a new democracy. Let us not be micro minded Or by useless joys be blinded, Then shall knowledge keep us free I Then shall knowledge keep us free! WATTA WORDSWORTH\nPERSONAL ADVERTISEMENTS\nWILL FORGOTTEN BORROWER of Adam's'Ph ys ios and Chemistry of Surfaces' from Room 25, Old Hostel, Please get in touch with the owner.\nSTOP PRESS\nSIR GEORGE THOMPSON has been elected Master of Corpus\nChristi, Cambridge. ( His father,'11\", was Master of Trinity} \u2022 UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT The University Grants Committee recently presented an Interim report on University Development194751 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer which led to his announcement that for the next quin que n niu m grants would be increased to Universities not to students. Whereas the grant for the whole of Great Britain rose from \u00a39 to \u00a316 J million in the last five years, arise from \u00a320 to \u00a325 million is proposed for the next five. Since before the war, full time student numbers have increased by over70* though not evenly over4 the whole country. At Oxford, Cambridge and London, where expansion was limited Or suffered in the war, the increase was only about40*, while for the rest of England it was 1 2 3 * , with Scotland and' Wales at10 and85* respectively. This rapid increase in members is now tailing off and it is felt that the Universities should devote the next few years not to further expansion but to consolidation, so that future development may be undertaken, without the strain that has been a feature of postwar years. To oops with the increasing number of students the \u2022\nstaff numbers have also rise h, and th\u00a9 staff student ratio has actually been improved from 1:10 pre-war to1:9 last year, in spite of the shortage of suitable people. There is still room for improvement here, especially in view of the fact that an increasing proportion of students are postgraduate, and the ratio more like the1:5 wh i oh obtains a tI.C. is required. Of the quality ef students it appears that the duds are being fairly s uso ess fully weeded out and by far. the\ngreater proportion of the increased numbers are good\nsecond class, leaving the number of really first el as s people much the same but lower in proportion. It can be seen from the curves below that while the number of Arts students is much larger' than that of any other Faculty, the rises in the Science Faculties have been proportionately greater. According to the university teachers it appears that a. larger proportion of outstanding students are now enrolling in the Science Faculties, and in spite of early special is ation, extracurricular lectures, when provided, meet good\nros po nBS. It is a pity that, through fear of prolonging; the undergraduate courses, they do not s a jr that some such\nlectures should be compulsory.\nSTUDENTS\nW iSma \u00bb \u00ab * t*K><**\" The greatest difficulty is the building bottleneck^\nThe estimated needs for the last quin que n niu m exceeded, by\nfar the available resources and warning has been given that the position will be no better for some time. Meanwhile\nit is only natural that the Exchequer which provided about\n70 % of the universities total income should prefer Aeronautical departments to Hostels, in spite of the fact that for an increase of35,000 students between 1938 and 1951,\n/only 7,000 new resident places were provided. It is cold comfort, but we should not come to college if there were\nonly a hostel and a refectory. Dear Sir LETTER TO THE EDITOR Mines night is approaching and many people will buy tickets for the play on that night, hoping and expecting to beam used by clever\" audience participant If recent form is any guide they are going to be sadly disappointed. The standard of the humour on this traditional occasion has dropped to the... point where ill mannered noise and assault of the cast are considered amusing. At the last\" Mines Night\" a reasonably good play was ruined. If the miners did have anything witty to add to the play it was lost in the general uproar. Ido not believe that the miners are solely to blame for the decline. Much of the noise that now offends does not originate from them, but from other unruly elements in the audience. I appeal to the mines night audience from all colleges. This is aMines night. Let them deal with the play if they wish to, and Miners, if you have nothing witty to contribute then remain silent. If you have some real humour then speak up and let everyone hear it. Yours etc., P.G. HOLT.\nR.C.S. "
