    "content": "The next Harry Potter?\nSusanna Clarke\u2019s book Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is currently number four in the New\nYork Times hardback charts and is hailed as a rival to Harry Potter. Robert Holbach\nissues the first coveted five star rating of the year and interviews the author for Felix\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\n22\nBooks books.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThere\u2019s something afoot in the publishing industry. Book collectors\nare all excited about a forthcoming\nnovel. This novel has been compared to the works of Tolkien. It has\nbeen compared to Harry Potter. It\nhas been compared to anything and\neverything successful in the fantasy market. And, of course, most of\nthese comparisons are quite wrong:\nthis book is rather unique.\nLet\u2019s begin by describing the\npremise: in the book, Britain is an\nisland with a very strong magical\nand mystical history. But at the start\nof the nineteenth century, magic is\nin decline. It is strictly a theoretical\nscience, with no practical application \u2013 like advanced maths with a\ntwist. Two magicians aim to reverse\nall of that, to revive English practical magic. These two magicians are\nMr Norrell, a paranoid eccentric,\nand Jonathan Strange, a foolhardy\nyouth. Mr Norrell brings his abilities\nto public attention and proposes to\nhelp out in the war against France.\nAnd so their adventures begin.\nIt is perhaps the notion of magicians that causes a lot of the com-parisons. Magicians have become\npart of pop culture. Any newcomer\nhas Harry Potter, Dumbledore and\nGandalf to measure up against.\nJonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\nare quite different men. They don\u2019t\ngrow long white beards. They don\u2019t\nwave around any wands or staffs.\nNeither of them could be described\nas being particularly wise. In short,\nthey aren\u2019t the archetypes we are\nused to. Mr Norrell is studious, but\nparanoid. Strange is adventurous,\nbut easily distracted. These literary\nmagicians are amply supplied with\nthe things that many of their counterparts in other stories lack: flaws,\ndepth and individuality.\nBut to focus on just the two magicians is to do this story a great\ninjustice. There are fascinating and\nenchanting characters aplenty. We\nmeet ministers and prophets, wives\nand servants, fairies and generals.\nIndeed, it is often easier to identify\nwith the struggles of the servants,\nor the wives, than either of the two\nmagicians.\nReading this novel is quite a\ndelightful experience. It starts out\nplayful and witty. A few hundred\npages later, it is a tale of magical adventures in the war against\nNapoleon. And yet another few hundred pages later, the story becomes\nmuch darker, almost heartbreaking.\nI found it impossible not to connect\nand identify with the characters,\nand I can only commend Mrs Clarke\nfor achieving this feat.\nLooking at the book in a shop,\nyou will notice its length. The novel\nstarts out at a leisurely pace. It\u2019s the\nwritten equivalent of a comfortable\nstroll in a beautiful, enchanted land-scape, where every pond and every\nhill is a wonderful thing to behold. In\nfact, it is not merely a single story,\nit\u2019s a revelation of a world of stories.\nIf you have read The Neverending\nStory (by Michael Ende), you may\nrecall all the places where the\nauthor seems to get distracted by\na snippet of story, only to announce\n\u201cbut that is another story, and shall\nbe told another time\u201d. Well, Susanna\nClarke clearly does not agree with\nthis way of writing. Her book is\nfull of little background fables and\nmyths. And each of those tales is a\nmarvel of its own.\nThis is a very enchanting novel\nindeed, full of beautiful, witty prose\nand delights for any reader. No, it\nisn\u2019t like Tolkien or Rowling or Feist.\nIt\u2019s a different beast, and I am glad it\nhas been discovered.\nJonathan Strange &\nMr Norrell\nby Susanna Clarke\n(Bloomsbury)\nHHHHH\nYou started this book ten years\nago. When you set out, what did\nyou expect it to become?\nI think my expectations were pretty\nlow. I\u2019d never completed a novel\nbefore. I\u2019d started several. One of\nthem was supposed to be a literary\nnovel, one was a detective novel, one\nwas a fantasy novel. So I didn\u2019t really\nknow whether I could complete it,\nbut I thought it was a very good\nidea, and I had its shape in my head.\nBut it grew, it grew in complexity as\nI went on. I didn\u2019t know when I set\nout that I was going to pin it so much\nto real facts and have so much real\nhistory in it, but as I progressed this\nseemed a natural thing to do.\nThe real history is all about the\nNapoleonic Wars...\nAnd also the social background. And\nin some cases, placings. I\u2019ve tried\nto be as accurate as I can about,\nfor example, London and Venice,\nand the sort of social background\nposition of women and the servants\nand so forth. I tried to make that as\naccurate as I can, a sort of blend to\nground the magic. I find that magic\nbecomes more believable when you\nput it next to something which is\nquite mundane and quite ordinary.\nThe majority of the characters\nappear to be male. Were you ever\ntempted to give big magical powers to a female character?\nI wasn\u2019t, in this novel, although\nthe first short story I published is\nabout three woman magicians. So,\nI did it there, but in the main book\nI wanted to concentrate on Strange\nand Norrell. And it is a male book,\nbecause it\u2019s... it\u2019s this thing about\nbeing accurate about the time in\nwhich people lived. Women were\nnot powerless in the regency period\n\u2013 I think later in the Victorian period\ntheir opinions were less valued \u2013 but\nthe world of action belonged very\nmuch to men, and women\u2019s sphere\nwas the domestic sphere. And I\nwanted to be realistic about that.\nWhich is why I think it\u2019s become a\nbook that is largely about men. The\nnext one, maybe not so much.\nWhat about the next one? Do you\nalready have a plan for it?\nA plan is possibly putting it a bit\nstrongly. I have something of a\nplan, and I have started, and I know\nroughly what\u2019s gonna happen. But\nI\u2019m not a great planner, unfortu-nately. It\u2019s just not the way I work.\nBut it is set in the same world, and\nit will start shortly after Strange &\nNorrell finishes.\nOne of the characters I couldn\u2019t\nhelp but feel you were a big fan of\nwas the Duke of Wellington. He\u2019s\nalways seen in a heroic light...\nYes. I mean, he surprised me in the\nsense that when I researched him,\nI just got more and more entranced\nby him. And in a very curious way,\nhe\u2019s a self-made man as well. He\nreally was. I mean, he was born into\na privileged class, the son of an Earl,\nwhich doesn\u2019t sound particularly\nunderprivileged. But he didn\u2019t have\na title at the beginning of his life, his\nfamily expected absolutely nothing\nof him, they didn\u2019t even think he\nwould be a very good soldier. And he\njust continually formed himself into\nthe person he wanted to be. When\nhe arrived in the peninsula, nobody\nreally expected him to succeed, and\nnobody really knew how it was possible to succeed. But he worked out\nwhat you would have to do to get\nrid of the French, what sort of army\nwas needed to get rid of the French,\nand what sort of general was needed\nto command that army. And then\nhe turned the army into the army\nthat could do it, and himself into the\ngeneral that could command that\narmy. And that is impressive. Plus,\nhe was very witty, and always wore\ncool clothes. Great!\nA brilliant hero. You could almost\nimagine him being played by one\nof Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars...\nYes, except for the nose. They gotta\nhave the nose. He was called Nosey\nby his men, so you\u2019ve got to have\nthis long nose.\nThere goes the heartache hero of\nthe story... a big nose. Have you\nthought about movie adaptations\nvery much?\nThere\u2019s a lot of interest at the\nmoment. Partly from the fact that,\nobviously, fantasy books are very\nhot, as far as Hollywood is con-cerned. Apart from feeling rather\ngrateful that I don\u2019t have to do it, and\nwon\u2019t be asked to do it, it baffles me\nentirely how you would technically\nturn this into a film.\nWould you trust the film-makers\nto turn it into a good film?\nYou have to. I think, what you\u2019d do,\nis to hopefully choose the right film-maker, if you get the chance. I\u2019m not\nthe right person to do this. So, if it\u2019s\ngonna be done it would have to be\ndone by someone else.\nSo are you all excited about the\nbook coming out soon?\nI\u2019ve been excited for a very long\ntime, actually. It\u2019s great! There\u2019s a\nlot planned for the tour in America,\nand then I\u2019ll be doing more stuff over\nhere. So, it\u2019s a very exciting time.\nIt\u2019s not a very writerly time. I\u2019ll have\nto wait until this is out of the way.\nI must admit, I thought becoming\na professional writer would involve\nmore actual writing than it appears\nto, but that\u2019s the way it turned out,\nand I\u2019m very grateful.\nAre you ready to face up to large\nqueues of fans?\nI\u2019m not at all sure about the large\nqueues of fans. I mean it is wonderful that Bloomsbury are telling so\nmany people about it, but it is a first\nnovel... I think we\u2019ll wait and see.\nWell, proof copies sell for \u00a3100 on\neBay, and more...\nBook collectors seem to see me as a\nsafe bet, so that\u2019s a good sign.\nJonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is\nreleased in the UK today\n\u201cI\u2019d never completed\na novel before. I\u2019d\nstarted several...\u201d\nBooks interview: Susanna Clarke\nSusanna Clarke: an author whose first novel is tipped for great things\n\n"

The trial will gather\ninformation on who has used\nthe service, why they have\nused it and where they have\nbeen taken.\nThe \u2018worst case scenario\u2019\ncost of the trial has been calculated at \u00a31073.15 per term,\nalthough Miss Misbahuddin\nis confident of cutting this by\nrecruiting volunteers to drive\nand navigate the minibus.\nThe emergency night bus\nhas been criticised in the past\nfor providing transport for\nstudents who do not genuinely need it. Groups of people\nhave been allowed to travel in\nprevious years, and students\nmay have become reliant on\nthe possibility of a \u2018free ride\nhome\u2019.\nMiss Misbahuddin stressed\nthat this would not occur in\nthe future, as only emergency\ncases of vulnerable students\nwould be permitted to use the\nnight bus. She added: \u201cWe\u2019re\ngoing to keep a much stricter\nrecord of who is going on the\nminibus and why, and we have\nto check if they are using it\nevery week because there is\nan issue there as well.\u201d\nClub and society officials\nhave expressed concern at\nthe reintroduction of the\nservice, claiming that it will\ndivert money and resources\naway from club and society\nactivities.\nHowever,MissMisbahuddin\ninsists that the trial will finally allow the Union to consider\nthe future of the emergency\nnight bus properly, as no suitable data has been collected\nin the past.\n\u201cIt will be an\nemergency\nservice intended\nfor the\nvulnerable\u201d\nEmergency night bus\nreturns to Union\nStudent safety: a Union minibus will provide transport for the vulnerable on busy ents nights\nNew\nhandbooks\npublished\nThe Imperial College Union\nHandbook 2004 was published\nlast week. This 176-page A5\npublication is a comprehensive guide to the Union and\neverything that it can do for\nstudents, whilst also serving\nas an introduction to life at\nImperial College.\nAll UK-based freshers\nshould have received a copy\nby post, and all other fresh-ers will be given one at the\noverseas students\u2019 welcome\nmeetings.\nCopies of the handbook\nare available to all students\nfrom Union reception and\nthe Student Activities Centre\nthroughout the year. You can\nalso pick one up at the Felix\nand Union stands at Freshers\nFair. Any comments or questions about the Union handbook should be directed to the\nFelix office.\nAlso available is the latest\nImperial College Student\nHandbook, which has been\nput together by the College\nRegistry. This is a separate publication from the\nUnion handbook, and can be\naccessed online at www.ic.ac.\nuk/studenthandbook. It is\ndesigned to help you throughout your course of study.\nThere is important information about where to go for\nadvice and support, and about\nstudent facilities at Imperial\nCollege. The pages will be\nupdated throughout the year,\nso it would be useful to visit\nthem regularly. Comments\nand suggestions about this\nhandbook should be sent\nto Ruth Ellis, the Assistant\nRegistrar (Undergraduate\nAdmissions) at ruth.ellis@ic.\nac.uk.\nContinued from page 1\nThe Union urged the\nCollege to \u201csafeguard the\ncurrent student cohort at\nthe Wye campus, in particular ensuring that they are\nexamined and graduate with\ndegrees of the academic\nstandard they expected on\nadmission\u201d and to \u201cengage\nin consultation with students\nat Wye and other life sciences\ndepartments\u201d.\nThe College has discussed\nthe plans with representatives from teaching unions,\nbut their statement expressed\nno intention to consult stu-dents.\nUnder the proposals, some\nstaff will move from the\nDepartment of Agricultural\nSciences into other depart-ments, but around 30 academic staff will lose their\njobs, as will a corresponding\nnumber of support staff.\nUndergraduate teaching will continue at\nWye, but only in Applied\nBusiness Management.

    "content": "By Andrew Brown\nSilwood Park Correspondant\nFollowing the success of the\nWye column in Felix in previous years, it is time that another of Imperial\u2019s campuses\nfinds its voice. Silwood Park\nis situated in the Berkshire\ncountryside, around 45 minutes\u2019 drive from the main\ncampus at South Kensington.\nOriginally a biology field\nstation, we are a growing\ncommunity of around 120 stu-dents. Being all postgraduates on site, this does not\nstop us from celebrating\nFreshers Week like the rest\nof you! Students on the five\nmasters courses offered here\nare introduced to life on the\nwild side. Everything from\nthe natural history society to\nrabbit catching and recipes\nare covered in our extended\nfreshers fortnight.\nTo reassure newcomers\nthat living in the middle of\nnowhere does have its advan-tages, students are shipped\nin to central London on their\nfirst day to register (appar-ently the carrier pigeon system we have here is unreliable for getting important\nregistering details across).\nStudents then get the chance\nto look around London and\nvisit the Union bars.\nFrom then on they are\nintroduced to the social side\nof Silwood, our pride and joy,\nthe bar, with activities ranging from the usual pub quiz-zes, discos and pub crawls\nto the Silwood specific beeri-enteering. Drinking with an\nadditional element of danger,\nwe give participants a map\nwith locations of where beer\nis hidden and three hours to\nfind as many as they can. If\nthey have not returned within\nfive hours, we try to find the\nlost students, but it is not so\neasy when you combine alcohol with 100 hectares of land\nto get lost in.\nContrary to popular belief\n(especially of those who\nlive here), it is not all about\nalcohol \u2013 with a diverse community such as ours there\nare regular trips to Reading,\nSouthall, and Bracknell.\nLife then calms down for\na few weeks while students\nfind their feet and start their\ncourses, but the much anticipated Silwood beer festival\nlooms around the corner\nin November, followed by\nChristmas, Burns Night (not\nonly for the Scottish contin-gent), and the many events\nplanned for the coming year.\nSome find it difficult to adapt\nto the slower pace of living in\nthe countryside, miles from\nany civilisation, but once you\nhave got into the swing of\nlife, the vast majority of people enjoy it. We do not have\nanywhere near the population size as any of the other\ncampuses, but if you are not\none of the few biology or engineering undergrads who have\nthe pleasure of being sent out\nhere, Silwood is well worth\na visit.\nSilwood Park finds a voice\nA lovely building situated at Silwood Park\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004 9\nAround Campus felix@ic.ac.uk\nIf you would like to bring us news on any of Imperial\u2019s campuses, or just write about your own experiences, email us at felix@ic.ac.uk\nCompetitions\nWin Railcards\nFelix has five Young Persons Railcards\nto give away, worth \u00a320 each\nA Young Persons Railcard is an invaluable way to save money. It is available to anyone aged 16-25 at a cost of \u00a320 for a whole year, and entitles\nthe holder to one third off most rail fares in Britain. So, whatever you\nchoose to spend your money on this term, make sure a Young Persons\nRailcard is on your list.\nTo buy a Young Persons Railcard, all you need to do is go down to your\nlocal staffed railway station, rail appointed travel agent or authorised\nstudent travel office with:\n\u2022 A passport-sized photo of yourself\n\u2022 A completed application form (you can pick one up there)\n\u2022 \u00a320\n\u2022 Proof that you are either 16-25 years old or a mature student aged 26\nor over in full-time education\nFor more information visit www.youngpersons-railcard.co.uk.\nFor the chance to win a Young Persons Railcard, just\nanswer this question:\nIn The Simpsons, what method of rail travel is introduced to Springfield by entrepreneur and con man Lyle\nLanley?\nEmail your answer to felix@ic.ac.uk by Thursday 7\nOctober. The first five people to be randomly selected\nafter the closing date will win a railcard each. Felix\ncompetition rules apply.\n\n"

You can look\nforward to my scribblings in future\neditions of Felix, as I have the privilege of running Imperial College\nUnion for a second year and shall\nbe writing here to explain what I am\ndoing with my time and your money,\nas well as issues that affect the\nUnion or students generally.\nRepresentation and elections\nThe main purpose of a students\u2019\nunion is to act as the representative\nvoice of the students of the College.\nYou will read on the front page that\nthe College is embarked on a process\nof reviewing its governance struc-ture. Most of the outcomes of the\nreview (streamlining of committees)\nwill, in my opinion, benefit students\nas they will improve the way that\nthe College is run. Unfortunately\nthere is a negative outcome which\nis that there should be no staff or\nstudent representatives on Council,\nthe College\u2019s governing body.\nAt present there are six elected academic staff members of the\nCollege Council in addition to the\nUnion President. A Union Deputy\nPresident attends as an observer.\nThe proposals envisage there being\nno representatives on the governing body as it is felt that this is\ninappropriate, the role of governors\nbeing to bring external scrutiny to\nmanagement on long-term strat-gey. The College\u2019s view is that staff\nand student representatives\u2019 role\nis to interface with management,\nnot governors, on operational issues\n\u2013 in the same way that trades unions\nare not represented on the board of\ndirectors of a company.\nI believe that this recommendation is misguided. Universities are\nnot conventional \u201cbusinesses\u201d.\nImperial College is, largely, a public\nfunded body with responsibilities to\nwider stakeholders. The role of the\ngoverning body is to ensure that the\nCollege is acting in the wider public interest. Students are important\nstakeholders in higher education.\nWe all pay fees to be here \u2013 money\nwe could take elsewhere. At the end\nof the day, the future of the College\n(and the reputation of our degrees)\nis dependent on attracting the best\nstudents to study here. Surely students should be able to influence\nthat at the highest level?\nThe proposals are, at present,\njust proposals. They need to be\napproved by the next meeting of\nCollege Council (unfortunately full of\n\u2018yes\u2019 men) and they then need to be\napproved by the Queen through the\nPrivy Council, a process which will\ntake months, at least. It is important\nto use this time to demonstrate the\nimportance of student representa-tion. There are elections taking place\nfor membership of Union Council\n(the students\u2019 governing and policy-making body) in the second week of\nterm. Be sure to vote. Every vote in\na Union election is a vote in favour\nof the principle of student represen-tation. All registered students are\nautomatically Union members and\ncan vote online. To find out more,\nor to stand for election, visit www.\nunion.ic.ac.uk/elections.\nFreshers Fair\nTuesday sees the Union\u2019s annual\nFreshers Fair. This year it will last\nthe whole day. If you are a fresher,\nor even a continuing student, make\nit an absolute priority to go around\nand visit the stalls. Imperial College\nUnion spends more, per student,\nfunding clubs and societies than any\nother students\u2019 union in the country,\nand it shows.\nThere are some 300 recognized\nstudent societies at Imperial \u2013 far\nmore than anywhere else, offering\nan unrivalled diversity of activities\nand interests to get involved in.\nRemember that the opportunities\nyou have now to try new activities and hobbies at cheap prices\nwill never be matched again. I have\nfriends now who have graduated\nand moved onto high-flying jobs with\nno spare time who wonder what they\ndid with all their time at Imperial\n\u2013 so make the most of it while you\nare here.\nFinally...\nThe Union is here to serve you. If\nyou think there is something we are\ndoing wrong or have ideas for things\nwe could do better, please do not\nhesitate to get in touch. My office\nis on the first floor of the Union\nBuilding and I\u2019m always happy to\nmake time to see students.\nEnjoy your time here.\nHello and welcome! If you\u2019re a\nreturning student, then welcome\nback, chin up, it\u2019s not as bad as all\nthat; if you\u2019re a fresher, congratula-tions, you\u2019ve arrived, you\u2019re going\nto have a superb time at Imperial\nCollege.\nImperial (as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fed up\nof hearing) prides itself in the quality of its research and its teaching.\nIf you\u2019re a research student, you will\nbe allocated a supervisor to help you\nwith your work; if you\u2019re an under-graduate, you will be assigned a personal tutor to keep an eye on your\nacademic progress and your general welfare. We\u2019ll deal with supervisors later, since that\u2019s a whole can of\nworms of its own, and concentrate\nfor the moment on personal tutors.\nMany people have told me that,\nwhilst some tutors are great, the\nquality varies between departments\nand individuals. In order to achieve\ngreater consistency in the personal\ntutorial system, I will be conducting\na survey to find out what you think.\nWatch this space!\nHere are some typical things I\nmight be emailed about (or even\nhear in the bar) regarding personal\ntutors:\n\u201cDear Sam,\nI am a first year student in the\nDepartment of X. At the beginning\nof the year, some administrator\nmentioned something about a personal tutor, but I don\u2019t know who\nmine is, and I certainly haven\u2019t met\nthem. Some of my friends in other\ndepartments tell me that their personal tutors are really helpful, and\na re-app in my hall once mentioned\nthat his tutor helped him get back\nonto his course after he\u2019d failed. I\u2019m\nworried that I\u2019m missing out by not\nknowing who mine is. It would be\ngreat if you could help me, because I\ndon\u2019t know who else to turn to.\u201d\nI would reply:\n\u201cYou are right to be concerned\nabout not knowing who your personal tutor is. They are an invaluable contact within your department.\nThey should monitor your academic\nprogress, ensure that you get all\nthe help you need, and make sure\nyou know what\u2019s going on in your\ndepartment. If you haven\u2019t done your\ncoursework, you might find them\nchasing you up, but remember, they\nhave your best interests at heart!\nIt is also important that someone\nin the department is keeping an eye\nout for your personal well-being: in\ncases where this affects academic\nperformance, they can help you\nmore the earlier they know about\nany problems. This help can include\nanything from pointing you in the\ndirection of appropriate welfare support to helping you with your case\nshould you need to make an appeal\nagainst an academic decision.\nYour tutor is also a good person to\nask to write you a reference when\nyou apply for a job, so it\u2019s important\nthat you have a good working rela-tionship.\nYou should make it a priority to\nfind out who your tutor is, meet\nthem, and stay in regular contact.\nGood luck!\u201d\n\u25cf Sam Rorke is the Deputy\nPresident (Education and Welfare)\nof Imperial College Union. His remit\nis to oversee academic affairs, wel-fare, accommodation and student\ndevelopment, and ensure that students\u2019 views on these issues are\neffectively communicated to the\nCollege.

    "content": "SPORT sport.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Ed Johnson\nThe Imperial College Union\nBoat Club finished an exceptionally strong season\nwith success at the Henley\nRoyal Regatta, the National\nChampionships and the World\nStudent Games this summer.\nAlthough the club has been\nhighly successful over the\npast few years, winning at\na wide variety of different\nevents in the UK and abroad,\nit had not won at Henley since\n1998. The event is the most\nprestigious domestic regatta\nin the world, and the club\nhad come very close to victory there on a number of\nrecent occasions. This year,\nthey entered a team into a\nnew event, the men\u2019s student coxed four. The club\nalso had two eights entered\nin the Temple Challenge Cup\n(for student eights) and a B\ncrew in the coxed four event,\nwhich unfortunately failed to\nqualify.\nOn the Wednesday of this\nfive day regatta, the first\nImperial crew to race was\nour B eight, who had drawn\nManchester University\u2019s\nfirst eight. The crew, mainly\nmade up of this year\u2019s nov-ices, put up a strong fight but\neventually succumbed to the\nManchester crew, who had\nbeen finalists at the BUSA\nregatta.\nThe coxed four had a fairly\ncomfortable race against\nthe University of London B\ncrew, who put all they had\ninto the first half of the race,\ntheir challenge fading rapidly from that point on. The\nTemple A crew then raced\nGlasgow University, coached\nby Imperial College graduate Nigel \u2018Killer\u2019 Atkins.\nUnfortunately, the Scots,\naided by Nigel\u2019s inside knowl-edge, put up too strong a\nfight for Imperial to match,\nalthough the race was very\nclose.\nThursday dawned with only\none Imperial crew \u2013 the four\n\u2013 left in the regatta. They\nwere up against Cambridge\nUniversity, who, though small\nand rather scrawny, seemed\nto think that they would be\nable to repeat their feat of last\nyear, when they had won the\nevent. However, the Imperial\ncrew of Ed Johnson, Hugh\nMackenzie, George Whittaker\nand Simon Hislop, coxed by\nSeb Pearce, blew Cambridge\naway, with the race over well\nbefore the halfway stage.\nFriday was a rest day, so\nthe semi-final was not until\nSaturday. This was against\nTrinity College Dublin. This\ncrew had already been\nbeaten at the Gent regatta\nin Belgium, but were looking\nfor revenge. However, once\nagain, Imperial gradually\ndrew away, and a comfortable\nlead going down the enclosures meant that a sprint was\nnot needed and the crew were\nin the final.\nSunday at Henley is now\nentirely given over to finals,\nwith the student coxed four\nbeing the last one. This meant\nthat the crew had the whole\nday to get nervous, before\ngoing down to the course in\nthe afternoon. The strong\nheadwinds that had been a\nfeature of this regatta for\nthe whole week were again\npresent, meaning that times\nwould be slow, and the opponents for the final, Isis (from\nOxford University) had the\nfavoured inside station. As\nboth crews made their way\nup to the start, the tension\nwas obvious, with a very large\n\u201cIsis made a\ndesperate push\nto get level but\nImperial came\nback strongly\nto win by half a\nlength\u201d\nHenley ghosts laid to rest\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\n26\nROWING\nThe victorious Imperial\ncrew at\nHenley: (left\nto right)\nSimon Hislop, George\nWhittaker,\nHugh Mackenzie, Ed\nJohnson\nand cox Seb\nPearce\n\n"

    "content": "CLUB REVIEW\nThe End is one of London\u2019s best\nclubs. Situated in a prime location just off Shaftesbury Avenue, it\nattracts a certain breed of clubber.\nOpened ten years ago by Mr C,\nformerly of The Shamen, and Layo\nPaskin, one half of progressive tech\nhouse duo Layo & Bushwacka, the\nconcept behind this place is simple\n\u2013 a club designed with clubbers in\nmind.\nWhat this means is that all the\nniggles than could potentially spoil a\nnight out are sorted. The door policy\nis intelligent \u2013 there\u2019s no dress code\n(except for glam electro night Trash,\non Mondays), so if you\u2019re going with\nthe sole intention of dancing, feel\nfree to wear trainers and a T-shirt.\nQueue jumping outside is actively\npoliced by the courteous yet stalwart door staff. The sound system is\nawesome \u2013 different frequencies are\namplified individually and played on\nseperate speaker cones, meaning\nthe music is very loud, yet amazingly crisp and clear, even if you\u2019re\nstanding right in front of the speak-ers.\nUsually in clubs, revellers are\nforced to refill water bottles from\nsinks in the toilets. The toilets in\nThe End are far too nice for this,\nand instead they provide a water\nfountain \u2013 something very simple\nyet almost unique. The DJ booth\nin the main room isn\u2019t raised out of\nsight of the clubbers \u2013 instead it\u2019s\nat the perfect level to see exactly\nhow (and with what records) your\nfavourite jock is making that amazing sound. To top it all off, you get a\nwristband when you enter, and this\nwill also allow entry to the adjoining\nAKA Bar.\nThe club has a capacity of around\n1000, and different nights may use\nthe entire space of the club as one\nroom, or split the lounge bar off\nseparate from the main dancefloor.\nThe crowd is one of the things that\ndraw me to The End \u2013 this is where\nthe bright young things come out to\nplay. Some people may feel young or\nmore likely underdressed in comparison to everyone else there, but\ndon\u2019t be put off by this. The End is\nfull of like-minded people, all there\nto enjoy the same music. People\nstill make the effort to look good,\ngiven that they don\u2019t have to, which\nreflects the atmosphere and style of\nthe place.\nThe music policy is as impressive as everything else here. There\nis variety in the different nights,\nfrom the electo of Trash to drum\nand bass with regular Ram Records\nand Progression Sessions nights.\nAt the same time, The End is most\ndefinitely a house club. The type of\nhouse most found here, and which\nworks best, is tech house - minimal\nbut to the point, stylish and sexy. It\nalso sounds amazing over a five way\nPA system.\nOne of the regular house nights\nheld at The End is \u2018As One\u2019 presents\nClassic, fronted by Chicago DJ\nDerrick Carter (Classic records is\nhis own label).\nTonight, having spent the day in\nthe park enjoying South West Four\n(see review above), my friends and\nI decided to end the night at The\nEnd. On arrival I was pleasantly sur-prised, as I always am when I come\nhere. As you enter the club you\narrive in the area bang in between\nthe lounge and the main dancefloor.\nClassic records nights make use of\nthe lounge and the main floor sepa-rately, and by the time we arrived,\nthe man himself, Derrick Carter,\nwas playing the main room with his\ndeep, techy sound. In the lounge,\nthe music was more funky, happy,\nsoulful house.\nAfter the day\u2019s fun, we were all\npretty knackered, but that was no\nproblem. We moved straight down to\nthe best spot in the house \u2013 in front\nof the DJ booth, where you can see\nexactly what he\u2019s up to and hear it\nall in the most astounding detail.\nCarter\u2019s music is sublime \u2013 tough\nyet smooth, pounding and insistent\nyet warm. His sense of timing and\nthe finesse and precision of his mixing make for well crafted and well\nrounded sets. Listening to him play\nand dancing to his beats feels like no\neffort at all. It feels like this is how\nyour body was mde to move.\nAfter a lot of bouncing, twisting\nand grooving, once again the not-so-small hours rolled around, and it\nwas 7am and sadly time to go home.\nThis had been the perfect end to\nthe perfect day, and as we left, the\npersistence of one stubborn clubber\nsaid it all, as he insisted to Carter\nthat he must \u201cdo a rewind or play\nanother record\u201d.\nSimon Clark\nFESTIVAL REVIEW\nSummer for any music lover means\nfestival season. Whatever style\u2019s\nyour bag, there is sure to be plenty\non offer, and whilst the majority of\nthe big festivals take place outside of\nLondon (Reading, Glastonbury etc),\nthere\u2019s almost always something\ngoing on in the city.\nDance festivals are slightly different to the usual setup of a weekend\u2019s\ncamping with music each night \u2013\nthese things are generally one night\nstands, all about the headline DJs\nand the variety of music offered\nacross various stages, tents or are-nas.\nThis August I was treated to South\nWest Four on Clapham Common\ncourtesy of hard house promoters\nHeat UK. This particular dance fest\nwas an all day affair, starting at midday and continuing into the night,\nbut was over at 10pm so the crowd\ncould head off to one of the official afterparties or to any one of\nLondon\u2019s smorgasbord of evening\nentertainment venues.\nThe festival had a lot going for it\n\u2013 10,000 people, three areas of different music, and a big name line-up\nincluding the likes of Eric Morillo,\nXpress-2, as well as Tall Paul, BK,\nRob Tissera and Nick Sentience,\nand progressive house don Sasha.\nThe event had been touted as\nSasha\u2019s only UK outdoor performance this year, and his sundown set\nwas part of his tour promoting the\nrecent Involver mix CD. Considering\nthat the event was going to be huge\ngiven its urban location, plus the fact\nthat seeing Sasha in this country is\nsomewhat of a rarity (even more\nso seeing him play outdoors as the\nsun goes down, and here he would\nbe appearing about as close to my\nhouse as possible), it really would\nhave been rude not to go.\nHaving already been out the night\nbefore for some bouncy silly fun\nat Knowhere at Brixton\u2019s famous\nFridge, I was a little jaded to say\nthe least, but our crew managed\nto make it to Clapham Common by\n1pm, by which time the party was\nalready going in full force. Most of\nthe 10,000 were already there, and\nthe arena \u2013 made up of the outdoor\nMain Stage, plus the much smaller Heat UK tent with hard house,\nand the Bora Bora tent with some\nblissful balearic house vibes \u2013 was\nalready looking quite full.\nWe headed straight for the main\nstage, where Eric Morillo was spinning sunny, funky house music to\nthe crowd who were already moving\nand bouncing to the bumping, bubbly beats. With warm sun shining\ninto the shaded eyes of the beautiful people, observing the spectacle\nthat is thousands of happy people\nin the park, all dancing to the same\nbeat and having the time of their\nlives, it would have been hard not to\nenjoy myself. And this was only the\nbeginning.\nAs the day progressed, we\nexplored the site a little. The Bora\nBora tent was a heaving mass of\nbodies, dancing to amazing music,\nbut with absolutely no space inside,\nwe had to enjoy this one outside\nfrom the grass.\nThe Heat UK arena was slightly bigger and slightly less full, but\nfaster and with a more heads-down\nvibe than the rest of the festival. An\nhour or two later, after a tactical\nchill-out in the sun, we headed back\nto the huge main stage \u2013 taking\nup a good two thirds of the entire\narena \u2013 and got down to the sound\nof heavyweight house trio Xpress-2,\nwho were spinning across no less\nthan six turntables. The music and\nthe crowd continued to flow into the\nearly evening, with progressive stalwart Lee Burridge making a sur-prise, if brief, appearance. There\u2019s\nno doubt that part of the atmosphere was the anticipation of what\nlay ahead: sunset to the sound of\none of the world\u2019s top DJs, Sasha.\nSasha truly is one of the best.\nHe\u2019s been a firm favourite for years,\nwith a honed instinct for playing to\na crowd, some of the most uplifting and driving dance music around\ncoupled with the hottest new tunes,\nand an almost unique mixing style.\nGreeted by rapturous applause, he\narrived onstage to join Lee Burridge\nand commence his set. Sasha\u2019s technical ability is pretty much unparalleled \u2013 his technique means he has\nthe power to build up a crowd, lay a\nvast breakdown on them and then\nbuild it all up again, only to drop a\ndriving, hammering track that quite\nliterally makes everyone go wild.\nHis mixes are closer to remixes,\nand his sets are seamless. This man\nis not \u201cjust playing other peoples\nrecords\u201d, he is using them as tools\nto fashion a unique musical experi-ence. How exactly he does this is\nhard to say, but mixing \u2018in key\u2019 is a\nskill that he uses to its full, creating\na musical transition between each\nrecord that fits the progression in\nsound. As well as this, effects, loops\nand pitch shift can all be thrown into\nthe cooking pot as part of the recipe\nfor a big slice of tasty progressive\ncake.\nLaying down his first track, the\ncrowd were instantly captivated and\nthe pace was set for the night ahead.\nAs the sun arced down to the hori-zon, we were wowed by an awesome\nblend of pounding beats, enveloping\nmonster bass sounds and bleeping\nechoing melodies, with music by the\nlikes of Way Out West and antipo-dean artist Luke Chable.\nAfter moving and shaking us\nthrough three hours of top notch\nmusical entertainment, Sasha\u2019s\nset finished and the crowd roared.\nThis had been a fantastic day, but\nthe best news was that it wasn\u2019t\nover yet. With official afterparties at\nBrixton\u2019s George IV and the stylish\nPacha in Victoria, the crowd dispersed quickly. We decided to head\nuptown to The End, to see Chicago\u2019s\nDerrick Carter (see review below),\nbut had to go home for a brief pit\nstop \u2013 ten hours of South West Four\nhad turned us into gibbering wrecks,\nbut I can\u2019t think of a better way to\nspend a sunny summer\u2019s day.\nSimon Clark\nClubbing on Clapham Common\nThis August, Clapham Common was host to South West Four, an all day, three stage\ndance festival featuring Eric Morillo and Sasha\nDerrick Carter\nSouth West Four\nClapham Common\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nClubs clubs.felix@ic.ac.uk\nSasha wows the crowds from the main stage at South West Four\nKeep on dancing to The End\n\u2018As One\u2019 presents Classic\nThe End, West Central Street\n\u00a312 students\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2729\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004 19\n\n"

    "content": "Science science.felix@ic.ac.uk\nThis is your platform, the next train is for science\nWelcome back to the science\npages of Felix. In my second\nyear as science editor, I intend to continue along the\nsame lines as last year. The\naim, as before, is to report on\nsome of the latest developments in the world of science\nand to publish your opinions\nand feature articles on science in its larger, societal\ncontext.\nTo believe that it is possible to continue practising\nscience in a political and cultural vacuum is a myth just\nabout as absurd as believing that the Earth is flat.\nFor science to progress in\nthe modern world, scientists\nhave to be able to communicate the meaning and purpose of what they are doing\nto society. A research interface exists not only between\nscience and business (as we\nare only too keenly aware\nat Imperial College), but\nbetween politics, culture, the\nmedia, and even the arts.\nAt the same time, scientists have to stay true to scientific values and reaffirm\nthe importance of objectivity\nin their work. How should the\nscientific community reconcile the objectivity demanded by their vocation and the\nsubjective values that are so\nprevalent in politics and the\nmedia? This is one of the\nissues, amongst many oth-ers, that Felix Science can\naddress during the course of\nthe year.\nLast year, we had articles\non a very wide variety of\nsubjects, ranging from the\ncontroversy surrounding\ngenetically modified foods\nthrough to quantum theory,\nthe existence of God, and\neven the effect of LSD and\ncrack on spiders. There are\nmany other things to write\nabout, of course.\nAnd it doesn\u2019t always\nhave to be serious \u2013 a sense\nof humour is obligatory,\nbecause you can\u2019t take anyone who hasn\u2019t got a sense\nof humour seriously. So\nI hope that this year you,\nthe reader, will continue to\nfind something of interest\nin these pages and will also\nfind the time to contribute to\nthis, your forum.\nBy Darius Nikbin\nThe release of Morgan\nSpurlock\u2019s highly anticipated\nSuper Size Me has drawn\nthe public\u2019s attention to a\n$1 trillion industry whose\nunscrupolous and immoral\nmarketing tactics have damaged the health of millions.\nBe it in lobbying for favourable trade laws, pushing for\nchanges in food legislation, or\nstrategically recruiting nutritional scientists to promote\nthe dubious health content of\ntheir products, today\u2019s food\nindustry has unprecedented\ninfluence in government and\nscience to promote its interests at the expense of the\nconsumer\u2019s health.\nHardly a day goes past\nwithout us being told what we\nshould be eating. On televi-sion, on the radio, in scientific journals, various foods are\nchampioned or denounced for\ntheir so-called health value.\nIn addition to the dissemination of confusing dietary\nadvice, microbial outbreaks,\nuncertainty about GM foods,\nand the emerging fear of food\nbioterrorism have contributed to bewildering the masses\nand have lead to a climate of\ndietary paranoia which suits\nthe interests of food market-ers. From obesity epidemics\nto childhood diabetes, from\nfoot-and-mouth to salmonel-la, over the years the system\nhas failed to find a balance\nbetweens consumer interests and the food industry\u2019s\ninsatiable greed.\nThe facts are uncompro-mising. In a matter of seven\nyears between 1991 and 1998,\nthe rate of adult obesity\nincreased from 12% to 18%\nin the US. Today it is reckoned that one third of the US\npopulation is clinically obese.\nThe figures are reflected in\nthe UK where the blame for\nincreasing rates of childhood\ndiabetes in recent years has\nbeen placed at the door of\npoor dietary practices. The\nnumber of people dying\nfrom the effects of a highly\nsedentary lifestyle, dietary\napathy and an increasing\ncalorific intake is also on\nthe increase. Can this be\nblamed on the food industry,\nwhose unscrupulous marketing of their products has\nconsisted of a constant \u201ceat\nmore\u201d message? Should the\nfood industry be regulated\nso that unhealthy products\nare labelled in a similar way\nto tobacco products? Should\nadvertising aimed at children\nbe banned in order to promote healthy nutritional ethics from an early age?\nIn no area of industry is the\nfailure to consolidate public\nand commercial interests\nmore evident and paradigmatic than in the field of public nutrition. And nowhere are\nthe difficulties more manifest\nthan in the US. There, the\ngovernment has been advising people on what to eat for\nover a century now. To begin\nwith, and up until the 1970s,\na succession of administrations advised the populus to\n\u201ceat more\u201d. The objective\nwas, ostensibly, to address\nissues of malnutrition and\nvitamin deficiency that afflicted a significant proportion\nof the population. However,\ntowards the late seventies\nthe government\u2019s message\nhad to change. Scientific\nresearch identified a high-cholesterol diet as a major\ncause of heart disease and\nother chronic health prob-lems. In its duty to protect\nthe nation\u2019s health, they had\nto radically shift policy from\n\u201ceat more\u201d to \u201ceat less\u201d. This\nwas a move that would never\nsit well with food producers,\nwho had long been used to\nfavourable market conditions\nfor selling products. To this\nday, the food industry has\nfought in the law courts and\nlobbied Congress to prevent\nthis simple message of \u201ceat\nless\u201d getting to a public eating themselves to death.\nThe American food industry manipulates the public\nthrough marketing and\ninfluences Congress legislators and regulators through\nlobbying. In doing so, the\nactions of the food industry\nare thoroughly analogous to\nthat of the US tobacco industry in trying to influence sci-entists, federal agencies and\nthe government to promote\nthe marketing and legitimacy\nof their product. Food companies use every means available to create and protect an\nenvironment that is conducive to selling their products\nto a public.\nIt could be argued that in\nthis sense food companies are\nno different to a whole host of\nother industries in the US\nthat lobby Congress and fund\nscientific research in order\nto effect political change.\nHowever, when more studies are showing that foods\nwhich are high in sugars and\ncholesterol are potentially\naddictive, and more hospital\nbeds are being filled by people suffering from the consequences of a high-calorie\ndiet, questions have to be\nasked about the legitimacy\nof their practices. Research\non rats at the University of\nWisconsin Medical School,\nfor instance, has found that\nthe changes in the rats\u2019 neu-rochemistry from having a\nhigh-sugar diet were similar\nto those inflicted by heroin\nand morphine.\nFood addiction is an area\nthat scientists are only just\nbeginning to explore, but the\nsigns are not good for the\nfood industry. McDonald\u2019s\nhas already been threatened\nwith legal action accusing it\nof promoting bad diets and\nselling intrinsically unhealthy\nfood. Although the first few\nlawsuits have been thrown\nout, it is only a matter of time\nbefore one ruling in favour\nof the customer leads to an\navalanche of lawsuits against\nfood companies \u2013 especially\nif further studies confirm\nthat fatty foods have addictive properties. The fact that\nMcDonalds are now selling\nsalads on their menus is a\ndirect result of this threat\nof legal action. But many\nthink that the damage has\nalready been done. In the\npast 20 years, obesity levels\nin American children have\ndoubled.\nDefenders of the food industry would say that unlike\ntobacco, food products, by\ntheir very nature, cannot\nbe intrinsically unhealthy\n\u2013 since they can always be\nincorporated into a balanced\ndiet. At face value they have\na point, but the consensus\nforming in the scientific community would disagree \u2013 for\nthem, there is not much difference between smoking\ncigarettes and eating junk\nfood. Both habits are addictive and both can have fatal\nconsequences.\nThere is now a community\nof people who want to change\nthe operations of an industry worth $1 trillion and the\ndietary habits of a nation of\n290 million people. Bona fide\nnutritionists want to promote\ndietary education in schools,\ncampaign for food label-ling, have TV advertising for\nunhealthy foods restricted,\ntaxes levied on soft drinks\nand other high-sugar prod-ucts, and healthy foods like\nfruits and vegetables to be\nsubsidised.\nThe anti-\u2018big fat\u2019 legal community will be looking for the\nsame kind of success that\ntobacco litigators achieved in\n1998, when cigarette companies agreed to pay out $246\nbillion over 25 years to settle\nlawsuits brought by US states\nfor tobacco-related healthcare costs. Although they are\nunlikely to succeed on the\nsame scale, due to the fundamentally poisonous nature\nof tobacco constituents,\nthe anti-\u2018big fat\u2019 movement\nbelieve that, on the basis of\nscientific results, food companies should change their\nways or be punished for their\nirresponsible commercialisa-tion of junk food.\n\u25cfJamesRobinsonargues\nthat consumers should\ntake more responsibility:\nComment, page 7\n\u201cThe facts are\nuncompromising...\none third of the\nUS population is\nclinically obese...\u201d\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004 5\nA \u2018super size\u2019 food industry gone berserk\nMorgan Spurlock\u2019s new film Super Size Me has brought attention to an inherent conflict\nbetween consumer and corporate interests that has given rise to the obesity epidemic\nFelix Science is looking for\nregular and occasional\ncontributors.

Put sim-ply, it is the Imperial society that gets people to cause\nhavoc, make fools of themselves and push the patience\nof authority to its very limits\n\u2013 and beyond.\nIt is the only society whose\nname, when mentioned,\nmight just persuade the\npolice to release you back\ninto the public domain without charge following arrest.\nThe only requirement for you\nto be allowed to partake in\nthe chaos is to carry a collecting tin and get the London\nfat cats to put some of their\nunearned bonuses into it.\nFor those in doubt as to the\nkind of insanity I am talking\nabout, past examples include\nrowing around the Trafalgar\nSquare fountains dressed as\na monkey, streaking through\nthe Bank of England, tiddly-winking the entire length of\nOxford Street and pub crawling your way around all 26\nstreets on the Monopoly\nboard.\n\u201cBut why do people do\nthis?\u201d I hear you cry. Well,\nit\u2019s for charity. This year\nour nominated charities are\nCancer Research UK and\nthe Mercury Phoenix AIDS\nFoundation \u2013 worthy of a bit\nof time and effort I\u2019m sure.\nThe focus of all this mad-nessisRAGWeekinFebruary,\nwhen a great many students\nwill miss lectures to help\nput a little laughter into the\nWorld of Highly Depressed\nLondoners in what is, after\nall, one of the more miserable\nmonths of the year. To join in\nthe frivolity, all you have to\ndo is turn up \u2013 a member of\nthe Union is automatically a\nmember of RAG.\nIf you fancy doing more\nthan just turning up and want\nto get involved in the organisational side of things, visit us\nat the Freshers Fair. In fact,\nvisit us anyway, for we have a\nlarge stock of pint glasses and\nmugs to give away in return\nfor donations to our cause.\nWe know that February is a\nlong way away, so this year we\nhave decided to end Freshers\nWeek with a warm-up pub\ncrawl on 9 October from mid-day. The route is a tour of\ncentral London\u2019s landmarks,\ngiving you the perfect chance\nto practice drunken navigating whilst familiarising yourself with this great city.\nTo join in the fun, just get\na selection of your friends\ntogether (about six would do\nnicely) and come along to\nthe Union from midday on\nthe 9th. You will be kitted out\nwith tins and buckets, and\nthe route will be disclosed in\nall its glory. As with all RAG\nevents, silly dress is optional but strongly encouraged.\nPrizes will be given entirely\nat my discretion for anything\nthat vaguely amuses me or\nfor making stupidly large\namounts of cash.\nInsanity for charity\nMonkey business: the last time Imperial RAG were released on London\nBy Martin Chong\nSo once again I found myself\nready to head down to Devon\nfor two and a bit weeks with a\nbunch of all-singing, all-tap-dancing cast, some \u201cI might\ndance if drunk enough\u201d band\nmembers and a \u201cnot even\nremotely going to try to dance\ncrew\u201d (or so they claimed).\nThe purpose? To convert the\ntown hall into a theatre for\nten performances of Cole\nPorter\u2019s Anything Goes, just\nlike the other 30-odd times\nthat MTSoc Tour have done\nit!\nBefore we left the Union,\nthere was the fun task of\npacking steel deck, bits of\nset, lights, microphones and\nabout two and a half weeks\u2019\nworth of kit multiplied by lots\nof people into an 18 ton lorry.\nUpon our arrival in Devon,\nour first stop was the local pub\nfor a well-earned pint, before\nheading off to the school.\nThis became our home for\nthe whole of the tour, with the\noption to sleep in a tent or\nin classrooms. Airbeds were\ndefinitely essential items.\nFor the next five days,\nthe hall was filled with the\nsound of power tools and the\nsmell of fried breakfast amid\nmuch drinking of tea by the\ncrew. Meanwhile, the cast\ndid their usual last-minute\npanic rehearsals, with the\nband sauntering in a few days\nlater. The tech rehearsal ran\nfairly smoothly, as did the\nhuge order of fish and chips\nhalfway through for cast and\ncrew. Afterwards, it was a\ncase of all hands on deck as\nwe strove to finish the set for\nthe dress rehearsal the next\nmorning and the first performance in the evening.\nThus the fateful date\narrived. All in all, it went very\nwell, up until when I, as the\nlighting operator, switched off\nthe band lights just as they\nwere doing their exit music.\nNever mind. Fortunately, the\nDonkey award for the worst\ngaffe of the night was presented to the sound operator\nfor forgetting to mute one of\nthe mics, resulting in a muttered \u2018shit\u2019 ringing around the\nvenue from backstage. And\nthen the party began\u2026\nThe next two weeks saw\na general pattern form: get\nsteamed out of your tent at\nsome point in the morning,\nhave breakfast, find a shady\nspot, fall asleep (the hall with\nthe fans on was found to be\nbest for this), find lunch,\nresume sleeping, reset stage,\nfind dinner, do show, go to\npub, have party, and get\ninto tent just before crack of\ndawn. This was punctuated\nby after-show barbecues, visits to the local purveyor of\nice cream, costume parties,\na jazz night and of course the\nmiddle weekend dinner.\nThe venue got more and\nmore packed each day, culminating in the final night\nbeing completely sold out.\nThen, all too soon, the curtain\ndescended for the final time.\nThe crew immediately got to\nwork to strike the set, giving\nup at about 4am to catch a\ncouple of hours\u2019 sleep before\nloading up at 8am. Until, that\nis, we returned to the venue\nto find that the lorry hadn\u2019t\neven left the depot in North\nLondon yet.\nFor me, that was the end\nof the tour, as some of us\nhad to dash back to London.\nBut loading finally occurred\neight hours later, and when\neverything was finally packed\naway in the Union on Monday,\nthe tour officially reached its\nconclusion.\nAll that leaves is for me to\nfind a nice work placement\nthat lets me go again next\nyear!

    "content": "Imperial Medicals RFC\nTour of Canada 2004\nBy Piers Thomas\nSuccess on the pitch was\nmatched by the players\u2019 enjoyment of their surroundings as\na 42-strong Imperial Medicals\nparty toured Canada over the\nsummer.\nThe tour had been a source\nof excitement for several\nmonths, and the party arrived\nin Calgary, Alberta on 15 July.\nConfidence was high following a successful season, and\nthere was a good number of\ndoctors, bringing experience\nto supplement the enthusiasm of the younger players.\nThe squad billeted at the\nUniversity of Calgary, where\nthe first couple of days were\nspent training and acclima-tising. There was universal\nacclaim for the impressive\nsports facilities that the\nNorth American colleges\noffer their students, including an Olympic speed-skating\ncircuit. It\u2019s a shame that our\nown Charing Cross campus\ndoesn\u2019t have the potential for\nsuch development.\nThe Medicals were fortunate to be visiting Calgary\nduring the annual \u2018Stampede\u2019,\nwhere the locals enjoy getting\nback to their cowboy roots\nwith rodeos and such like.\nOn the day of the first game,\nthe squad arrived at the host\nclub to the bad news that the\nscheduled first XV opposition\nwere unable to field a side.\nThis was attributed to hard\ngames over the previous few\ndays and, one may suggest,\neven harder drinking at the\nstampede. This cancellation\nmeant that the second XV\nwere cast onto centre stage\nin the opening game, against\na useful side from an upstate\ntown, Red Deer.\nRed Deer had been\ndescribed as an American\nfootball team who occasionally played rugby, so there\nwas understandably a little\ntrepidation in the warm-up,\nmainly centred around who\nwould get their ribs broken\nfirst.

    "content": "Just over 2000 years ago, seven\nkingdoms struggled for access\nto the human capital and natural\nresources of what is now modern-day China. Between 230 and 221 BC,\nthe Kingdom of Qin, ruled by Qin\nShihuangdi, waged war and conquered the other six kingdoms, unifying the country into what would\nbecome the first dynasty of China.\nQin had the idea of unifying \u2018all\nunder heaven\u2019.\nHero tells the story of an assassin called Nameless (Jet Li), who\nvisits the highly unpopular and\naspiring Emperor Qin (Chen) to\nenlighten the Emperor of how he\nhas vanquished three of the most\ninfamous assassins and enemies of\nQin: Broken Sword (Tony Leung),\nFlying Snow (Maggie Cheung), and\nSky (Donnie Yen). For such heroic\nservice, Nameless is granted an\naudience within ten paces of the\nEmperor and asked to recount the\ndetails of his victories. However, as\nNameless begins to tell his story\nabout how he used a love triangle involving the three assassins to\ndivide and conquer, Qin begins to\nsee holes in the account and senses\nthat all is not what it seems.\nWhile the comparisons with\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\nare inevitable, the style of Hero is\nquite different. While Crouching\nTiger, Hidden Dragon was made\nmore accessible to Western audiences through scripting and a love\nstory, the dialogue in Hero is typically what you would expect in a traditional Chinese martial arts epic,\nwith plenty of terse speech.\nHero is one of the most visually stunning films to have been\nreleased in recent times, surpassing\nthe viewer\u2019s imagination (which is\nnot easy) with some truly inspired\nscenes. The amalgamation of colour and movement is simply amaz-ing. The action scenes are choreographed to perfection. The martial\narts sequences put those of The\nMatrix and Kill Bill to shame. Hero\nwas actually completed in 2002 \u2013\nbefore Kill Bill \u2013 but was its release\nwas delayed, to avoid Crouching\nTiger, Hidden Dragon.\nThe plot is not as strong as one\nwould have hoped, but the underlying message is as bleak as it is\nthought provoking \u2013 the unifying\nforce of totalitarianism is valued\nabove democracy and individual\nfreedom, and the path to peace is\noften through conflict.\nThe cast is littered with star names\nfrom Hong Kong. Maggie Cheung is\nstriking and elegant, fitting the bill\nas the love interest. Tony Leung\nplays the calligraphy master with\nequal parts sensitive beauty and\nrough toughness. However Zhang\nZiyi, as Moon, suffers in a peripheral\nrole as Broken Sword\u2019s understudy,\ngiven very little to do other than a\nfew fight scenes. Yen only appears\nbriefly at the beginning of the film,\nthough he manages to make quite\nan impression in his limited screen\ntime. Finally Jet Li is impressive as\na distant and stone cold killer.\nHero is not about the star cast, the\nrather weak plot, or the poignant\nending. It is quite simply a glorious visual treat. Watching it is like\nwatching a dream that is awash in\nvivid colour and splashed in liquid\nimagination.\nAlan Ng\nFilm Editor\nI need a Hero\nYimou\u2019s epic is visually awesome, but slightly let down by the plot\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\n24\nHero\nDirector: Zhang Yimou\nStarring: Jet Li, Tony Leung, Maggie\nCheung, Donnie Yen, Daoming Chen,\nZhang Ziyi\nLength: 96 minutes\nCertificate: 12\nHHHHI\nFilm film.felix@ic.ac.uk\nHe\u2019s got to be strong: one man will change an empire\nWant to review films, get free tickets and go to previews?

    "content": "With the beginning of the new\nacademic year comes a new\ngroup of young and eager\nstudents ready to embark on\na journey that will probably\ntransform their lives completely by providing a gateway to fun, freedom and even\nfortune due to the increased\nemployability of Imperial\ngraduates. However, before\nwe start contemplating buying an Aston Martin DB9\nover a Ferrari Scaglietti, we\nneed to look at our current\nfinancial state first.\nInstead of telling the\nreader how to manage their\nfinances, for which there are\nmany hundreds of books that\ncover the issue in depth, I\nwill expound the underlying\nconditions that determine\nthe price of one of the most\nfinancially consuming commodities for students and lecturers alike, namely alcohol.\nAlthough the stages in the\nproduction of alcohol have\nchanged very little since its\nconception many centuries\nago, the price has risen like\nthere\u2019s no tomorrow. There\nare several factors that can\nbe attributed to this extreme\nprice change, some of which I\nwill now outline.\nAt the forefront of the pricing mechanism is the issue\nof alcohol duties. Initially\nintroduced to assist native\nbrewers in competing with\nmuch cheaper imported bev-erages, alcohol duties have\nturned out to be a handsome\nsource of income for Customs\nand Excise. Duty rates are\ndependent on the alcohol\ncontent of the beverage being\nsold and the origin of the\nsource, with home brewers\nbeing charged much less\nthan those importing alcohol.\nAlthough there is an array of\ndifferent duty rates for spirits\nand wines, the rate for beer is\na constant figure, currently\n\u00a312.59 per hectolitre per cent\nof alcohol in the beer.\nThe next source of\n\u2018Government funding\u2019 comes\nfrom alcohol taxes, a discreet\nyet distinct (from alcohol\nduties) contributor to pric-es. Alcohol tax in the UK is\nthe highest in the European\nUnion, bar none. Although it\nis not as volatile as alcohol\nduty, this tax can be up to a\nstaggering 70% of the nominal price you might pay.\nHowever, this Government\nscheme has had its desired\neffect to some extent. By rocketing up the price of beers,\nspirits and wines, this policy\nhas reduced the alcohol consumption level considerably.\nSubsequent research has\nshown that there has been\na significant decrease in\nalcohol intake by youths and\nthe tax has thus led to fewer\nalcohol-related car fatalities,\nassaults and health issues.\nLocation, location, location.\nThis is one of the few opportunities where the reader has\nsome control over how much\nhe/she pays when it comes\nto buying beverages. There\nis a huge variation of price\nwhen it comes to alcohol,\nranging from the dirt cheap\nbooze of parts of Wales to the\nludicrously overpriced spirits of the Che restaurant in\nGreen Park. More often than\nnot, the alcohol is overpriced\ndue to the greediness of pub\nowners, restaurant managers and multinational vendors such as SABMiller and\nDiageo.\nIn some respects, the UK\nis lucky with regard to the\npricing of alcoholic beverages compared to other EU\nnations. Norway\u2019s breweries,\nfor instance, have been hit\nhard by the increasing cost\nof alcohol due to their intricate political situation. Also,\ninflation has without a doubt\nbeen one of the key factors\nunderlying the base price of\nthe whole beverages suite.\nFrom what has been dis-cussed, it is clear that\nCustoms and Excise have\nno intention of lowering\ntheir income from alcohol,\nand the price of beer seems\nset to continue to rise without bounds. Combined with\nthe living costs of South\nKensington and the forthcoming introduction of top-up fees, this could have a\ndevastating effect on student\nfinances that could leave students struggling to get out of\nthe red for many years after\ngraduation. With so much\nat stake, it is apparent that\nthere is very little scope for\na student to be drinking on\na night out, let alone go on a\nbinge at the Che restaurant.\nWhy a bottle of beer is bound to\nbear a burden on a budget\nNumaan Chaudhry gives a gentle introduction to the new Business section by looking\nat the factors determining the cost of alcohol\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\n4\nBusiness business.felix@ic.ac.uk\nDoes anyone fancy a pint?

The present student\nrepresentative, the Union\nPresident, would be removed\nfrom the Council, as would all\nmembers of academic staff\noutside the senior management team.\nDrEileenButtle,theCouncil\nChairman, wrote the letter to\nreport on the progress of her\nreview of the Council and its\nCommittees. She is due to\npresent formal recommendations on 15 October.\nThe letter states that \u201cthe\ngoverning body should be\nseen as a meeting between\nthose responsible for delivering the College\u2019s plans and\nnon-executives charged with\nensuring that those plans are\ndelivered in the interests of\nwider stakeholders in this\nprestigious UK university...\nIf this revised model for the\nCouncil is adopted, elected\nmembers have no role to\nplay.\u201d\nThe letter continues: \u201cI\nwould propose that the\nImperial College Union be\ntreated as analogous to a\ndepartment outside the faculty structure. The President of\nICU should be invited annually to Council to submit his\nUnion\u2019s annual report.\u201d\nImperial College already\nhas a low level of student representation on the governing\nbody compared to other uni-versities, and if the proposals\nwere accepted, it would be the\nonly university with no student representation at all.\nMustafa Arif, President of\nImperial College Union, called\nthe proposals \u201cmisguided\u201d\nand told Felix: \u201cStudents are\nthe most important stakeholders in higher education.\nCouncil is there to hold management to account over\nCollege\u2019s long term strategy.\nThe College\u2019s future depends\non attracting and retaining\nthe best students, so student representatives should\nbe able to contribute to that\nprocess.\u201d\nSenior figures within\nGovernment would appear to\ndisagree with Dr Buttle\u2019s rec-ommendations. Answering a\nwritten question in the House\nof Lords on 13 September,\nLordFilkin,theParliamentary\nUnder Secretary of State,\nsaid: \u201cIn our response to the\nDearing report in 1998 we\nsupported the recommendation that students should be\nrepresented on the governing\nbodies of all higher education\ninstitutions. We continue to\nsupport this principle.\u201d\nThe Council is expected to\napprove Dr Buttle\u2019s proposals\nat its next meeting. However,\nstudents\u2019 groups and teaching unions are likely to lobby\nagainst them. The forthcoming review of Imperial by the\nQuality Assurance Agency is\nseen as extremely important,\nand it could count against the\nCollege if the Agency decides\nthat students\u2019 views are not\nbeing heard.\nTony Mitcheson, the\nCollege Secretary and Clerk\nto the Council, said: \u201cCouncil\nis about the non-executives\nholding executive management to account. Students\nshould be focusing their effort\nand input on day-to-day management and operations.\u201d He\nstressed that the plans were\nonly proposals and were to be\ndebated at the next meeting.\nProfessor Rees Rawlings,\ntheProRectorforEducational\nQuality, told Felix that the\nproposals would have \u201cno\nnegative effect on educational quality, because that is all\ndealt with by the Senate [the\nCollege\u2019s senior academic\ncommittee]\u201d.\nAlthough the Senate may\nbe able to deal with academic\nissues, it remains to be seen\nhow the Council of an academic institution can govern\neffectively without representatives from the student body\nor the academic staff.\n\u25cf State of the Union,\npage 6\n\u201cIf this revised\nmodel is adopted,\nelected members\nwill have no role\nto play\u201d\nMaximum fees\nTwo thirds of all universities\nare set to charge the maximum fee of \u00a33000 for every\ncourse.

In\na statement, the College said\nthat the principal aim was\nto maintain \u201ca world class\ninstitution for teaching and\nresearch in life sciences\u201d.\nIt appears that the changes\nare financially motivated, with\nthe Faculty of Life Sciences\npredicting a deficit of \u00a311.6m\nby the end of the 2006-7 financial year. The Department of\nAgricultural Sciences, which\nis wholly based at Wye, contributes a loss of \u00a31.8m per\nyear.\nProfessor Sir Leszek\nBorysiewicz, the Deputy\nRector designate, said: \u201cThe\nfinancial position of the\nFaculty of Life Sciences is\nunsustainable and cannot\nbe allowed to continue. The\nFaculty\u2019s presence at the Wye\ncampus in its current configuration is not economically\nviable.\u201d\nThe proposals were met\nwith dismay by students and\nstaff at Wye. Imperial College\nUnion issued a statement\nexpressing its concern at\n\u201cthe lack of consultation and\nvague nature of statements\nabout the future of agricultural sciences and teaching\nat Wye\u201d.\nContinued on page 2\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\n18\nMusic music.felix@ic.ac.uk\nMuch more than a tiny spark\nCult singer-songwriter Brendan Benson returns to the UK for a series of\nlow-key gigs, but what about the new stuff?\nLIVE REVIEW\nI knew tonight was going to be spe-cial; what I didn\u2019t know was how\nspecial it was going to be.\nBrendan Benson is a singer-song-writer from Louisiana whose second\nalbum, Lapalco, which he recorded and produced himself, got the\nmainstream music press salivating.\nSince then, he\u2019s disappeared off the\ncommercial radar, becoming somewhat of a cult artist among fans of\nBen Kweller and Ben Folds.\nThankfully,aftertwoyears,Benson\nhas finally pieced together enough\nsongs to release another record and\nhas embarked on a low-key, acoustic\ntour. He strides onstage, every bit\nthe lanky American teen (despite\napproaching his thirties). Smiling\nshyly, he picks the first few chords\nto one of Lapalco\u2019s most Beatleesque tunes, Good To Me. Within 30\nseconds, the Borderline is ringing to\nthe sound of 200 voices singing.\nBrendanlooksincrediblysurprised\nby the strength of the response, and\ngrins nervously. \u201cThis one\u2019s a new\none, I know you guys want to hear\nold stuff, but you know,\u201d he says,\nbefore launching into a track that\u2019s\neasily the equal of anything from his\nlast two records. Surprisingly, few\narms are crossed, and I look across\nto see a gaggle of thirty-somethings\ndancing like my dad.\nThe great thing about the\nBorderline is that the capacity is so\nsmall that only dedicated fans can\nget in, creating an enviable environment for artists to try out their\n\u2018new stuff\u2019. Most of Benson\u2019s set is\nsuperlative, despite most of it being\nnew \u2013 about halfway through the\nset is a spectral, impossibly pretty\nsong that shows just how talented\na songwriter he has become. His\nvoice now has a colossal range, and\nhis clear singing allows you to laugh\nat his wittily wry lyrics.\nFluffed lines, slightly wonky guitar parts and false starts endear\nBrendan to the crowd. It\u2019s good to\nsee an artist not taking himself too\nseriously \u2013 after forgetting the lyrics to a song, he laughs and drawls,\n\u201cWell, I wrote it 15 years ago!\u201d\nFinishing up the set with a half-speed version of Lapalco\u2019s strongest\ntrack, Tiny Spark, Brendan looks\nshocked that the crowd bellow every\nsingle word. I\u2019d even say there was a\nlittle tear in the corner of his eye.\nBrendan Benson is a songwriter\nat the height of his talents, and from\nthe sound of tonight, his next record\ncould be enough to make him the\nstar he deserves to be.\nAndrew Sykes\nBrendan Benson\nThe Borderline\nHHHHH\nBrendan Benson: normally he smiles more than this\nSleazy guitars,\neighties synths\nand bad hair\ncuts make a\ncomeback with\nKasabian\u2019s\ndebut\nALBUM REVIEW\nTouring partners Chikinki did it a\nfew months ago, and now almost a\nyear after the release of their first\ndemo, fresh from scoring a top ten\nentry in the singles chart, Leicester\nquartet Kasabian finally release\ntheir self-titled debut album.\nArmed with a host of filthy, beat-heavy tunes, Kasabian are making\nmusic to simultaneously rock and\ndance to. They do it with stacks\nof attitude and an underlying sinister tone that will send a shiver\ndown your spine and back again.\nAs other British guitar bands tediously jump on the electronic band-wagon, there\u2019s just something about\nKasabian that makes you sit up and\ntake note.\nThe album is kick-started with a\nmenacing riff from distorted guitars and a roaring delivery from\nvocalist Tom Meighan, making Club\nFoot one of the more aggressive\ntracks. It leads on to what has to be\nKasabian\u2019s defining moment on the\nalbum \u2013 the outrageously bouncy\nProcessed Beats with baggy beats\nreminiscent of the Stone Roses\u2019\nFools Gold. Think Ian Brown on a\npogo stick and you\u2019re not far off the\nmark.\nID is a favourite opener at\nKasabian shows and it\u2019s not difficult\nto see why, as it opens with chilling,\npulsating electronics before building up to an anthemic climax. Like\na dark reincarnation of the Happy\nMondays, Cutt Off and recent single Lost Souls Forever with their\nShaun Ryder-esque vocals are\nfunky and eerie at the same time,\nwhilst Running Battle and Butcher\nBlues provide something soulful\nfor the more chilled Kasabian fan.\nThe boys clearly love their synthesizers as much as they love their\nguitars, and nowhere is this more\nevident than on Ovary Stripe which\ncombines sampled dialogue with a\nmelody that will leave you unsettled\nfor days.\nThe stunning U Boat brings the\nalbum to a poignant close with\nhaunting vocals, this time provided\nby guitarist and keyboardist Sergio\nPizzorno. It\u2019s a perfect conclusion\nto what is undeniably a gem of an\nalbum, leaving Kasabian set to kick\nthe filth back into rock and roll after\nthe Keanes and Coldplays of the\nmusic world well and truly cleaned\nit out.\nHeba Abu-Own\nFree stuff\nIn accordance with the directions of\nthe mighty El Editore, we have for\nyou a little competition. As you may\nor may not know, the Felix office\nhas basically been a huge mess for\nas long as I can remember. Well,\nit\u2019s now been thoroughly cleared\nout and as a result we have a fair\nnumber of CDs and DVDs hanging\naround collecting dust.\nWhat CDs, I hear you cry. Well,\nwe have the Lord Of The Rings,\nShallow Hal and Chopper film\nsoundtracks; the new Charlatans\nalbum, Up At The Lake; the excellent Seachange album Lay Of The\nLand; a new record from Swedish\nband The Legends, Up Against The\nLegends; and finally, Sugarcult\u2019s\nPalm Trees And Powerlines.\nThat\u2019s not all, no sirree. There are\na few singles as well: The Ordinary\nBoys\u2019 rowdy singalong Week In\nWeek Out, complete with special\nedition packaging; Amplifier\u2019s Neon\nsingle; and Razorlight\u2019s ubiquitous\nGolden Touch.\nLast, but not least, we have two\npromotional DVDs to give away. The\nfirst is Far East Man, a live DVD of\na Ronnie Wood gig in London, featuring classic Stones tracks as well\nas few famous covers. The other\nis a Katy Rose DVD, a young and\nupcoming songwriter.\nTo win all this, you need to email\nmusic.felix@ic.ac.uk with the\nanswer to this question: What\u2019s the\nname of the new Thrills album?\nDon\u2019t forget to tell us your name!\nEditorial ramblings\nHello my dear friends, \u2018tis your erstwhile music editor-type person welcoming you to this wonderful first\nissue of Felix.\nFirst off, let me welcome all you\nfreshers that are probably attempting to soothe your hangover and\ntrying to remember what the hell\nhappened to the last 12 hours. We\u2019ve\nall been there. For the rest of you,\nwelcome back to another year of\nborderline insanity and overwork.\nFelix now has a new editor and\na new look. The newspaper format\nnow gives all of us section editors\nmasses of room to play with, so\nlook forward to lots more features,\nincluding regular competitions and\na more diverse selection of reviews.\nAnyhoo, all this extra space means\nwe need reviewers. Lots of \u2018em. We\nhave plenty of contacts with promotion companies, and these lovely folks provide us with loads of\nfree CDs, normally before they are\nreleased in the UK. You come along\nto a meeting in the bar, sit and\nchat with your fellow music-loving\nreviewers, take a few CDs, listen to\nthem and send me a review. There\u2019s\nno experience required; I\u2019d never\nwritten in my life when I joined up\nin the first year.\nAs if getting free albums and singles wasn\u2019t enough, we also get\nfree tickets and guestlist places to\na huge number of gigs in London.\nWe\u2019ve had tickets to see The Thrills\nat Abbey Road Studios, Coldplay\nat Earl\u2019s Court, and those are just\nthe big ones. All you need to do is\nprovide me with your email address,\nand I mail out a list weekly or twice\nweekly with listings. You choose\nwhat you want to go to, I give you\ntickets, you review it.\nSounds great, right? We try to\nbe as diverse as possible, so if the\nthings I\u2019ve mentioned seem a bit too\nmainstream for you, you should still\ncome along \u2013 we have great contacts\nwith a lot of independent labels and\npromotion companies.\nIf you\u2019re interested, I\u2019ll be on the\nFelix stand in the Union Dining\nHall at the Freshers Fair so you\ncan join up. Alternatively, you can\nemail me at music.felix@ic.ac.uk, or\ncome to the first meeting of term on\nThursday 7 October in dBs.\nANDREW SYKES\nMUSIC EDITOR\nKasabian\nKasabian\nArista Records\nHHHHI\n\n"

    "content": "www.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004\nNEWS news.felix@ic.ac.uk\nBy Emily Gwyer\nTwo years before universities\nbecome able to charge variable fees of up to \u00a33000, a new\npoll has found that two thirds\nof vice-chancellors are planning to charge the maximum\namount for every course.\nThe poll, published in The\nGuardian, revealed that the\nheads of the majority of universities in the country have\ntaken the step of charging\nthe maximum rate allowed,\nwith many driven by fears of\nappearing second rate and of\nhaving insufficient money to\nfund their bursary schemes.\nIt was originally thought\nthat universities would\ncharge differential fees to distinguish between courses on\nthe basis of their popularity\nor the amount it costs to run\nthem. Now, as vice-chancel-lors make the big decision in\ntime for the 2005 prospectuses to go to press, that appears\nnot to be the case.\nIt was always known that\nImperialCollegeandtheother\nRussell Group universities\n(the major research-based\nuniversities in the country)\nwould charge the full amount.\nSir Richard Sykes, Rector of\nImperial College, told Felix: \u201cI\nfind it difficult to believe that\nan organization of the standard and quality of Imperial\nCollege would not charge\nthe maximum \u00a33000 for their\nscience courses, since even\nwhen we charge \u00a33000 we\u2019re\nlosing a hell of a lot of money.\u201d\nHe argues that the maximum\nlevel should be raised higher,\nto around \u00a35,000.\nStudent numbers will not\nfall at Russell Group institutions if fees are set at the new\nmaximum level, such is the\ncompetition for places. It is\nthe smaller, newer and less\nrich universities which face\nan agonizing decision about\nhow much to charge. Charge\nless, and they run the risk\nof appearing second rate;\ncharge more, and students\nmight not think it worth the\ncost.\nMany universities are finding it difficult to do the maths:\nhow much are they able to\ncharge to appear competitive\nwhile being able to fund the\nessential bursary schemes\nthat will also begin in 2006?\nThis difficult balancing act\nhas left most seeing no way\nout but to charge the maximum amount. However, a\nwrong turn could be disastrous \u2013 setting the cost too\nhigh could deter students\nfrom enrolling, which could\nbankrupt a small university.\nAlthoughthisnewsisunlikely to affect future Imperial\nstudents, it does suggest that\nthe idea of \u2018choice\u2019 is a mis-conception: all that appears\nto be happening with the\nnew education marketplace\nis that, in essence, fees have\njumped from \u00a31150 to \u00a33000\nper year. We are yet to discover whether the bursaries will\nprovide enough extra income\nto allow poorer students to\novercome this, and whether\nuniversities will be able to\nattract enough students to\nsurvive.\n\u201cIt does suggest\nthat the idea of\n\u2018choice\u2019 is a\nmisconception\u201d\nTwo thirds of\nuniversities to\ncharge maximum\ntop-up fees\nStudent views ignored?

Mention\nmust be made of Underwood\nand Thomas, who both collected deserved hat-tricks.\nThe final score was 63-7 to\nthe medics.\nThis brought the squad\u2019s\nvisit to Calgary to an end,\nand they set off on the journey through the Rockies,\nbound for Vancouver. White\nwater rafting afforded them\nthe opportunity to experience some fantastic scenery,\nas well as typical Canadian\nwater temperatures. During\nthe drive they stayed over\nat Banff and Kamloops, and\nenjoyed the hospitality these\ntowns had to offer.\nVancouver is a city that\nmade a very good impression\non all the tourists, and most of\nthe party expressed interest\nin medical posts there. After\na short break from rugby, the\nMedicals were very keen to\nget back into the playing fold.\nThere was also a feeling that\nthey now had a reputation\nto defend, following the free-scoring games in Calgary.\nThe small town of Langley\nwere the next opposition, a\nfixture arranged for the first\nXV only. The game was again\nplayed in burning heat on a\nhard pitch, and the Medicals\nfound themselves down by\na couple of tries early on.\nHowever, the sensible, collected attitude displayed so\nmany times last season shone\nthrough, and the team went\non to score four tries and\ncontrol the game. The hard,\nthankless work put in by the\nbig forwards was the basis\nof the reversal, and despite\nthe early upsets, heads were\nheld high at the end, as the\nmatch finished 24-14 to the\ntouring side.\nThe next step was to travel\nto Vancouver Island, a short\nferry trip. The island itself is\nlarger than England, and the\ntowns were well Anglicised,\nwith a pleasant climate.\nAgain, emigration plans were\nalready being made by members of the group.\nA double-header was\narranged against Cowichan\nRugby Club, a team pre-sen-sitised to hospitals rugby, having played against a United\nHospitals Team in the recent\npast. Indeed, one member of\nthe party was remembered by\nthe hosts (though the reasons\nfor this were not discussed).\nThe second XV kicked off\nafter some rather hurried\npre-match preparation, and\nfor the first half hour struggled to resemble the team\nthat had played the previous\nweek. Consequently, the medics were deservedly four tries\nbehind at the break. Although\nthe standards rose in the second half, the team could not\nprevent a poor 33-14 defeat.\nThis left the first XV with\nthe task of restoring some\npride, and as if on cue, the\ngoods were delivered. The\ntries were again produced\nen masse, with the impressive Underwood picking up\nanother hat-trick. The performance was earmarked by\nmany as one of the best that\nthe Imperial Medicals have\never produced, and it was\nhard to disagree, as the final\nscore was 56-0 in their favour.\nThe fresh crab and hospitality\nthat followed were also first\nrate, and the squad headed\nto celebrate in Victoria with\nspirits high and voices out\nof tune.\nWhen back in Vancouver,\nthe Medicals had to take\nstock of the player situation.\nUnfortunately, they had been\nleft thin in certain positions\ndue to injury and departure,\nso the final game against\nlocal champions Abbotsford\nwas going to require a few\nimpromptu performances out\nof position.\nThe second XV were hardest hit, and lined up against\na strong looking opposition\nwith a mish-mash of a back\nline. However, strong character again shone through and\nthe medics found themselves\nahead at half time. Sadly, lack\nof incision at critical points\nin the second half saw them\nfail to capitalise on opportuni-ties, and Abbotsford struck in\nthe dying minutes to win the\nmatch 17-10.\nThe first XV were less dis-organised, but facing tough\nopposition at the end of a tiring tour proved to be a difficult task. Although an early\nscore put them in front, they\nrelied on the metronomic\nboot of Morris to keep them\nahead, and a hard fought 16-15 victory was attained.\nThus, an amazing tour came\nto a close. The good rugby\nand good jokes were matched\nonly by the hospitality of the\nlocals and the quality of the\nlocation. All of the tour party\nfelt privileged to be involved,\nso heartfelt thanks must go to\nthose who made this possible:\nTina Phelan for all her hard\nwork, despite not being able\nto attend; Dave and Shirley\nRollitt for their coaching (and\nall-round parenting) on the\ntrip; Greg Hamilton-Eadie for\nhis efforts pre-tour (we also\nwish Mary all the best for\nthe coming weeks); Dr Simon\nRogers, who was a first rate\nreplacement coach; and very\nimportantly, our benevolent\nsponsors, without whom the\ntrip would not have been able\nto proceed. We are indebted\nto Siemens Medical Solutions,\nNorwich Union Healthcare,\nThe St Mary\u2019s Association\nand the Hammersmith Fund.\n\u201cThe firsts left\nCalgary Irish\nliterally shell-shocked, scoring\nseveral tries\u201d\nReady for action: the Imperial Medicals second team\nas Imperial triumph\ncontingent of former and current Imperial oarsmen out to\nsupport.\nFor the first time at the\nregatta, Imperial College\nwere slightly down after the\nfirst ten stokes, but from\nthis point out to the barrier,\nwhich marks about a quarter\nof the distance, they steadily\nmoved out to a half length\nlead. From here to halfway,\nImperial were again faster\nthan Isis, but were not able\nto get clear water. As the race\nmoved into the final stages\ndown the enclosures, Isis\nmade a desperate push to get\nback level but Imperial came\nback strongly to win by half a\nlength.\nThree of the crew (Ed\nJohnson, Hugh Mackenzie\nand Seb Pearce) then\nmoved on to the National\nChampionships, where they\ncombined with Molesey Boat\nClub in order to start preparing for the World Student\nGames. This involved rowing\nin a coxed four and eight, in\nboth cases the main rivals\nbeing the old enemy, Oxford\nBrookes. The heats of each\nevent passed uneventfully,\nwith the crew qualifying comfortably for the finals. First\nup was the coxed four, where\nImperial/Molesey were racing the selected Great Britain\nU23 coxed four as well as\nthe other half of the eight.\nUnfortunately, an inexplicably bad start left Imperial/\nMolesey in sixth and last after\n250m, and although they were\nable to row through the field\nand past Brookes into second\nplace, the other Molesey four\njust managed to stay ahead\nand claim the gold.\nThis boded extremely well\nfor the eight, and these predictions proved to be justified\nas Imperial/Molesey powered through to beat Oxford\nBrookes into silver medal\nposition and claim the blue\nriband event of the regatta.\nMost of the rowing population would now be enjoying a\nholiday, but Ed Johnson and\nHugh Mackenzie then combined with Gavin Weeks and\nHenry Adams (both former\nUniversity of London) to\nform a coxless four for the\nWorld Student Games, which\nwere held at the beginning\nof September. After a long\nmonth and a half spent training in this combination, the\ncrew flew out to Brive, France\nwith high hopes.\nEight crews had entered\nthe event, and Great Britain\nwere in a heat of five with\nChinese Taipei, New Zealand,\nSouth Africa and Poland.\nAfter an excellent start, they\nhad a half-length lead over\nthe field, but the strong Polish\ncrew (fresh from the Olympic\nGames where they finished\nsixth) then came through\nto take the heat, with Great\nBritain second, just ahead of\nSouthAfrica.Intheotherheat,\nthe Irish won, with Germany\nsecond and France third.\nThis put the British crew into\na repechage with Germany,\nFrance, South Africa, New\nZealand and Chinese Taipei,\nwith four crews making the\nfinal. A good lane draw and\nconfidence were also at stake.\nGreat Britain had an excellent race, and although down\nto France and Germany off\nthe start, they did not panic\nand used superior pace\nthrough the middle 500m to\nmove through the field and\ntake the lead, before holding\noff a late charge from South\nAfrica.\nThe final was again in the\nheat of the day, and a slight\nmix-up with the timing meant\nthat the warm up had to be\nslightly abbreviated. As the\nrace went off, Germany got\nentangled with the lane buoys,\neffectively ending their race\nbefore it had really started.\nThe Poles got off to a flyer\nand lead the field, with Great\nBritain and Ireland about\nlevel behind them. This situation continued down the track,\nwith the Poles moving gradually away from the field. At\nthe halfway mark, it was clear\nthat Poland were going to win\nand that the race for the other\nmedals was purely between\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\nThrough the third 500m of the\nrace, Great Britain pushed\nhard to come back level with\nthe Irish, but were unable to\nsprint as hard and had to settle for bronze, which still an\nexcellent result.\nThis capped an exceptionally strong season for the\nBoat Club, which they will be\nlooking to repeat next year. If\nyou would like to try rowing\nthen look for the Boat Club\nstand on the Queens Lawn\nat Freshers Fair or get in\ntouch with the returning cap-tain, Seb Pearce, by email at\ndsp01@ic.ac.uk.\nOn the podium: the Great Britain four (right) at the\nWorld Student Games\n\n"

    "content": "Where does personal responsibility end\nand corporate responsibility begin?\nThis is the somewhat disturbing\nquestion posed by Super Size Me,\nthe latest in what seems to be a new\ntrend of big screen documentaries.\nThe film follows writer and director\nMorgan Spurlock as he embarks on\na month-long diet consisting solely\nof McDonalds food. In addition, he\nreduces his physical activity to a\nminimum in order to mirror that of\nan \u201caverage\u201d American. The burger\nmunching, including the obligatory\nvomit scene, is interspersed with\nexaminations by horrified doctors\nand personal trainers.\nWith a synopsis like this, I think\nI was justified in my scepticism. I\nmust admit to having a mental draft\nof this article even before buying\nthe popcorn \u2013 in fact I only really\nsaw Super Size Me so that I could\nrip it to shreds effectively. This plan\nwas somewhat ruined by the film\nnot actually being as ridiculous as\nI expected, so a severe re-draft was\ncalled for.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the central storyline is a daft shock tactic that tells us nothing we don\u2019t\nalready know. Nobody can seriously\nbe surprised to hear that Spurlock\u2019s\nextreme diet results in dramatic\nweight gain, but there are other,\nperhaps less obvious effects of the\njunk food binge such as depres-sion, tiredness and lack of sex drive.\nSufferers of these symptoms may\nwell be surprised to learn that their\ndiet could be to blame.\nSpurlock did not deny that his\nexperiment was extreme, nor\nwas the sole point of the film to\ndemonise the golden arches as I\nhad expected. In particular there is\na troubling investigation of school\nmeals in America, where a diet of\nchips and fizzy drinks is promoted to an increasingly inactive and\nobese youth. Cost is not to blame\n\u2013 we visit one school that serves up\nnutritious meals to its once unruly\nstudents who have been turned\naround at least partially by their\nimproved diet.\nMcDonalds\u2019 targeting of children\nthrough its marketing inevitably\ncomes under the spotlight. From\nRonald McDonald to in-store play\nareas and the happy meal, it would\nbe na\u00efve not to realise what they\u2019re\ntrying to do. Is it morally question-able? Probably. Does the buck stop\nthere? I don\u2019t think so \u2013 children\nwill always have wants, be it fast\nfood, holidays to Disneyworld, toys\n(I\u2019m still bitter that I never got a\nMr Frosty), and surely it\u2019s up to the\nparents to draw the line somewhere\nand say \u201cno\u201d. More importantly,\nsimply banning our children from\neating junk food is pointless, as one\nday they will be old enough to go out\nand get it themselves.\nWhat we need to do is educate\nour children so that they know why\nthese things are bad for us \u2013 that\ngoes for smoking, drugs and many\nof life\u2019s other evils. Education is\nan area highlighted by Spurlock,\nwith the startling revelation that\nnot many people even know what a\ncalorie is.\nTop marks must go to the marketing bods at McDonalds for their\nresponse to this attack, which basically echoes most people\u2019s reaction:\n\u201cThe film is slick, well-made and\nyes, somewhat annoyingly, doesn\u2019t\nportray McDonald\u2019s in the most\nfavourable light. And yet, what we\ndo agree with is its core argument\n\u2013 that if you eat too much and do too\nlittle, it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d They have\nscrapped the super size option in\nAmerica, supposedly for commercial reasons rather than as a result\nof this film. I hope that\u2019s the case\n\u2013 the super size meal is a ridiculous\nconcept which deserves to fail but\nonly because nobody would be daft\nenough to buy it.\nI remain sceptical about the director\u2019s reasons for making the film.\nThe genre is currently dominated\nby Michael Moore, the man behind\nBowling for Columbine and the\nBush-bashing Fahrenheit 9/11. Like\nhim or loathe him, Moore does seem\npassionate about what he does. I\ncan\u2019t help thinking that in this case\nSpurlock has spotted an easy buck\nin making a \u201cshocking\u201d film that\ncapitalises on the anti-capitalist\nvoice of today, at a time when bashing the evil corporations is the new\nblack. And in no way is this guy the\nnew Moore \u2013 aside from Super Size\nMe, Spurlock\u2019s most notable and\nrecent credit is for MTV gross-out\nshow I Bet You Will, in which he\npersuaded America\u2019s youth to do\nhumiliating things for cash. It\u2019s like\nJackass, but without the taste and\ndecency.\nWhat I really have a problem\nwith is the responsibility question\nthat introduced both the film and\nthis article. Where does personal\nresponsibility end? It doesn\u2019t. At\nno point can any of us just switch\noff and assume that someone or\nsomething else with deal with the\nrepercussions of our behaviour.\nIt\u2019s a lovely idea, and one which\nis at the root of many of today\u2019s\nproblems and certainly the growing compensation culture \u2013 people\nhave tried and thankfully failed to\nsue McDonalds because their food\nmade them fat.\nCorporate responsibility is a nice\ntheory, but it\u2019s not something we\ncan realistically expect in our commercial world. If a company of any\nsize is doing wrong, we have the\nright to know. Thanks largely to\nthe internet, now more than ever\nbefore information is available to\nthose who want it. And if you have\na problem with the McDonalds or\nthe Nestl\u00e9s of this world then by all\nmeans boycott them and do your\nbest to dent their turnover. In a\nfree market, it is the consumer that\nmakes or breaks a company \u2013 it\u2019s up\nto us to support the good guys and\nsqueeze out the bad.\nUnfortunately this well produced\ndocumentary devalues some important points with its ridiculous head-line-grabbing stunt, and it certainly\nhasn\u2019t turned me against the occasional burger for lunch. Perhaps\nI\u2019ll have one today, followed by a\ncoffee at Starbucks. They\u2019d better\nnot make it with hot water again\n\u2013 how am I supposed to know it will\nburn? Right, get my lawyer on the\nphone...\n\u25cf Darius Nikbin investigates\na \u2018super size\u2019 food industry\ngone berserk in this week\u2019s\nScience section, page 5\nJAMES ROBINSON\nCOMMENT felix@ic.ac.uk\nNew year, new Felix\nDAVE EDWARDS\nEDITOR\nEDITORIAL\nRotund McDonald: the corporation gets the blame, but is it really their fault if burgers make us fat?\nHello and welcome to a new era\nfor Felix, the student newspaper of\nImperial College London. For the\nbenefit of all our freshers, I should\nsay that Felix is here to inform and\nentertain Imperial\u2019s 11,000 students\neach week with news, reviews, opin-ion, puzzles, sports reports and lots\nof other interesting stuff as well.\nAnyone who has read Felix in the\npast will notice that we\u2019ve made a\nfew changes. The last time it had\npages this size was in 1974 (it\u2019s\nbeen A4 since then), so the decision\nto go for a \u2018compact newspaper\u2019\nformat was always going to be a\ndifficult one. I\u2019m confident that this\nwill firmly define Felix as a student newspaper, rather than lying\nsomewhere between newspaper\nand magazine.\nHaving consulted previous edi-tors, it becomes clear that the main\nreason why we\u2019ve stuck with A4\nfor such a long time is because\nFelix used to be printed in-house\nand the machines couldn\u2019t go any\nlarger. The majority of respondents\nto last term\u2019s survey expressed\na preference for newspaper over\nmagazine, and we will also save a\ncertain amount on printing costs,\nallowing us to print more pages and\nuse more colour. Anyway, I hope you\nlike the new look!\nI also want to mention that Felix\nwill now be released on Thursdays.\nI felt that the Friday release meant\nthat it was often \u2018missed\u2019 by some\nstudents until Monday, by which\ntime the content was already three\ndays old. Moving it forward should\nallow everyone to get hold of a copy\nwithin one day of publication.\nAside from being read by thousands of people each week, Felix\nalso exists to allow any student to\nget involved in running a news-paper. You can take part in anything and everything we do, and if\nyou\u2019d like to get involved it would be\ngreat to hear from you \u2013 just email\nfelix@ic.ac.uk or come and see us at\nour offices in the West Wing of Beit\nQuad (the Union building in South\nKensington). We\u2019re always looking\nfor new writers, editors, columnists,\ndesigners, reviewers, photogra-phers... the list goes on. Don\u2019t worry\nif you\u2019ve never done anything like\nthis before \u2013 training is available,\nand enthusiasm is just as important\nas experience.\nAt the Freshers Fair on Tuesday\n5 October, I\u2019ll be at the Felix stand\nin the Union Dining Hall, together\nwith various members of our current staff. Come and see us to find\nout more about what we do and\nhow you can get involved. You will\nalso be able to pick up a copy of the\nImperial College Union Handbook\n2004.\nBy the way, just in case you\u2019re\ninterested, I have just finished four\nyears of maths here at Imperial,\nand I\u2019m now lucky enough to work\non Felix full time.\nI would like to thank all my staff\nfor their hard work on this, the\nfirst and probably the most difficult\nissue of the year. Finally, to anyone\nwho told me that I\u2019d be working\nhard and would probably have to\nstay up all night on deadline day: I\nknow I said it wouldn\u2019t happen, but\nyou were right. It\u2019s 5am.\nwww.felixonline.co.uk\nFelix\nThursday 30 September 2004 7\n\n"
