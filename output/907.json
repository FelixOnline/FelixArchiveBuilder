    "content": "Scribbler's Corner\nDodgy Dealing in\nCheapskate Denied\nDear Andy,\nIn January the Union purchased a new\nminibus and sold our oldest one. Despite\nthe old one being accepted in part\nexchange for the new one. I would like\nto make it clear that the two were in no\nway related, despite minutes to the\ncontrary.\nThe purchase of the new van would\nprobably have gone ahead anyway, even\nwithout the sale of the old one. Having\nsaid this, we were extremely disappointed\nthat our mechanic gave us a duff quote\non the van. I thought \u00a32 million was very\nreasonable for a bashed old transit.\nThe Union Transport Manager thought\nso as well, at least he did before we\nbrought him in on his day off and sacked\nhim. It's funny, but his idea to upgrade\nthe transit to a caravan seemed like a good idea.\nIn any case, everyone has forgotten\nabout it now. The first lot of passengers\nhave ridden in the new van, and now\nthat they've got used to it, we're going to\nup the hire charge.\nFinally, Andy, don't blame me for this\nmess, I wasn't employed by the Union at\nthe time. The fact that I sat on the\nTransport Committee that discussed this is\npurely coincidental.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Milon.\nHAIRDRESSERS15 A HARRINGTON ROAD, SOUTH KENSINGTON0718238968 We have a fantastic offer for all you\nstudents, a cut wash and blow dry by our top stylist\n(which normally costs around \u00a321)\nFor only \u00a311 Men \u00a312 Women Check us out !\nJune is normally the month the\nQueen's Lawn becomes the stage\nfor the Summer Fair.

    "content": "! Rector's Question Time:\n'I don't think that starving is the next option'\nCaught between the Devil and the deep blue sea\nSir Eric Ash, Rector of Imperial College,\ntook part in a question and answer\nsession on Monday evening. Over a hundred students listened as Sir Eric\nfielded questions on a 'wide range of\nstudent and non student issues. Union\nPresident , Mr Paul Shanley, chaired the\ndiscussion and took both prepared and\nspontaneous questions from the floor.\nDespite the controversial nature of\nmany of the topics raised the atmosphere\nremained relaxed and somewhat informal.\nAlthough many questions centered on\nstudent concerns, money and\naccommodation - the lack of it, the\npresence of college staff ensured a broader base to the discussion.\nThe most notable aspect of the\ndiscussion was the circular nature of\nmany problems facing both student and\nstaff alike; at the centre of that circle was\nmoney. In Sir Eric's own words 'people\nmight find it hard to believe but before I came to Imperial I was not obsessed with\nmoney.'\nIn answer to the question 'Now that the\nbinary divide has gone, and that some\npolytechnics in London may achieve\nUniversity status, is it time that Imperial\nshould reconsider the benefits of London\nUniversity and investigate opting out?' Sir\nEric stated 'we haven't stopped thinking\nabout it (opting out)'. He continued that\nal thr in o hIm rw iii l'^a\"6\" iO run\nour own (university)', with Imperial\ngaining little benefit in terms of cut price\ndeals organised through the University of\nLondon, the academic 'riches are\nfantastic' Sir Eric went on to advocate a course unit system where students could\nmix and match their degree choosing\nfrom not just one but all the collegiate\nmembers of the University of London.\nSir Eric proved unflappable in the face\nof searching questions about the future of\nMontpelier Hall and postgraduate\naccommodation in general. Commenting\non the handling of the Montpelier sale to\ndate Sir Eric admitted ' I think we've\nmade a terrible mess of it ', a comment\non the allegedly shoddy way the residents\nof the hall have been treated and the\nuncertainty over exactly how long they\nhad left in Montpelier. Sir Eric did seem a little confused saying on the one hand\n'there is no definite plan to sell the hall'\nand added 'but we're broke.' However\nthe Rector did admit 'I hope we won't but\nwe probably will.' The Rector raised the\ncontroversial topic of the Clayponds\npurchase independently of any question.\nHe connected the issue as an illustration\nof how much cheaper accommodation\nbecomes the further it is from college and\ndefended the buy as not simply the\ncreation of further debt but the sound\ninvestment of a loan.\nThe Rector did admit that financing of\nloans for accommodation was partly\nfunded by student rents and it was this\nfactor that influenced the steep rent rises\nproposed for next year. In answer to the\nwidely held belief that Imperial in\ncommon with other London colleges\ncould be pricing itself out.of the market\nSirEric replied 'the grants are greater in\nLondon than they are elsewhere'. This\ncomment was received with polite\nderision from the assembled students.\nRealising his mistake the Rector sobered\nup and said 'rent is the key issue'. One\nstudent said that he had such little money\nhe couldn't afford to live but the Rector\nsaid 'I don't think that starving is the next\noption.' The Rector's dual solution to\nstudent's financial problems involved\nborrowing money and earning money. He\nsaid that his American wife Clare held up\nto seven jobs to work her way through\nher university .\nThese comments provoked further\ncontroversy when the sensitive subject of\nthe lengthening of the college day was\nraised. The Rector is determined to see\nhis proposals for a longer college day put\ninto practice as soon as possible and is\nfrustrated at the delay caused by a characteristically lengthy consultative\nprocess that included a student union,\ncollege wide referendum. The Rector\nstated that this issue was 'not a good\nexample for the application of\ndemocracy.' The Rector also said that 'the\nconservatism of the staff is exceeded by\nthe conservatism of the students.'\nAccording to Sir Eric a lengthened\ncollege day would not result in increased\nlectures but the more effective use of\ncollege facilities. Sceptical students\nwondered how a longer day tied in with\nthe Rector's proposal that students should\nbe prepared to take on part-time work.\nLooking to the future and for a few\nbrief moments away from the bank\nbalance the Rector did not see student\nnumbers increasing in the coming years.\nHe did foresee a turn 'toward the\npostgraduate side' but remained\ncommitted to Imperial's undergraduate\ncourses. Sir Eric linked his proposal for a unified course system with the inclusion\nof a more varied humanities programme.\nSir Eric told the sorry tale of Imperial's one and only philosopher; he left because\nhe didn't have a hy other philosophers to\ntalk to.\n2\n\n"

'Perpetual Dawn', with its sk an king ska\nunderbelly and part icu ally laid-back rasta\nrapping, floats over you with Dr. Alex\nPatterson's intuitive knack for soothing\noceanic, nay womb-like sounds floating in\nand out of the mix.

A huge long passage\nwith a hazy end. Walking down this giant\ncauseway, banked by high white-washed\nwalls, it is apparent that the corridor is\nnot endless. In fact the whole purpose of\nthe passage is its end. One enormous,\nclinical, evenly lit toilet. It must be 30\nfeet high.

The team of\nfour British based students and three\nEcuadorian counterparts were led by Paul\nToyne of the Biology Department.\nInformation on the status of and current\nthreats to parrots is urgently needed as\none in thirteen of all threatened bird\nspecies are parrots. The work was in\nconjunction with the International Council\nfor Bird Preservation (ICBP) as part of\ntheir plan for South American parrots.\nSearching for parrots in the forests of\nEcuador proved to be a difficult task,\ndespite the loss of valuable equipment,\nencountering tear gas attacks and\ncontracting scabies, the expedition was a success.\nThe expedition succeeded in achieving\nits aims and collected information for the\nprotection of natural areas and thier\nassociated wildlife. Sadly, only one of the\nstudy species, the White-necked Conure\nwas found, which is thought to number\nless than a thousand individuals. The\nexpedition was able to record its calls\nand vocalizations, observed immature s, indicating breeding within the Podocarpus\nNational Park and collected information\non their feeding e col gy. Four foods\nsources have been identified. All of this\ninformation is new.\nMost of the work took place in the\nPodocarpus National Park in Southern\nEcuador and involved the participation\nand training of three Ecuador University\nstudents. The park is sadly threatened by\nmining, illegal settlement leading to\ndeforestation and cattle ranching. The\nexpedition's results are important as they\nadd both to the limited knowledge of the\npark's wildlife and the growing concern\nof the park's destruction.\nThe team plans to return to continue\nthe work in 1992 and are currently fund\nraising.

    "content": "I. SO Taming of the Shrew\nLondon Symphony Orchestra\nconducted by Sir George Solti\nMozart Symphony no 35 'Haffner'\nMahler Symphony no 5 Barbican Hall,\nMay 9th The LSO gave a fine interpretation of\nthe Haffner; crisply performed, accurate\nand surefooted. In fact, the orchestra\ngalloped though it with such immense\nease and proficiency that it was clear this\nwas an easy warm up for the main piece\nof the evening. Whilst it is understandable\nthat lesser orchestras would want to save\nthemselves for the more demanding\ngrandeur of Mahler's fifth, it is\ndisappointing that an orchestra of the\nLSO's capabilities felt it had to give itself\nsuch an easy ride.\nCarping aside, on to the Mahler. This is\na performance that the audience in the\nBarbican were pri vili ged to hear. From\nthe perfection of the opening trumpet\nfanfare (Maurice Murphy) to the final\nresounding chord, this was an\ninterpretation and execution to be\ntreasured.\nSolti added new twists and to what is a well-loved and, dare one say it, well worn\npiece. The effect was achieved in several\nways: through fine ensemble playing and\nfirst class performances by the soloists;\nthrough unusual shifts of emphasis and\nbalance between sections of the orchestra\n(a characteristic also heard in the Mozart,\nwhere dominant brass crispen ed traditionally soggy passages); and through\ncontrol of the acoustics so that both the\nloudest and quietest passages filled the\nhall without distortion.\nThe effect was particularly noticeable in\nthe Scherzo, normally a tiresome\nexperience for the audience, which\nbubbled with irony and excitement. The\nfirst movement was simply stunning:\nfrightening, moving and truly compelling.\nThe brilliance was temporarily mislaid in\nthe Adagettio in the final movement, but\nrecaptured in the rondo finale for a stirring finish.\nLiz W \u2014Film\n\u2014Theatre\n\u2014Concert\n\"The trouble with some women is\nthey get all worked up about\nnothing and then they marry him.\"\nCher.\nThe play is advertised as being SEXIST!\n\"They have a right to work wherever\nthey want to - as long as they have\ndinner ready when you get home.\"-John Wayne. But it wasn't! The play was performed at a tiny little\ntheatre above the Rose pub on the\nFulham Road. It's cheap, friendly and the\nbeer's good. The Rose Theatre Club was\nfounded by the american Robin\nBrockman, who plays Petrucio (the\nnum ero uno sexist). The Theatre Club\nbelieves that Shakespeare was a nom de\nplume of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of\nOxford. But no matter what your views\non the writer are the performance was\nexcellent and well worth the trip to the\npub.\nThe use of women as the servants\nallowed an interesting relationship to\ndevelope between themselves and their\n\"masters\" which, when coupled with the\nsize of the auditorium, led to a very\nintimate performance.\nThe play was described as \" a comedy\non the art of training a wife\". However\nthe impression given was that Katherina\n(Caroline Lawrie) was actually using\nPetrucio for her own gain, thus altering\nthe original sexist concept of the play.\nThe play is running until the 15th June\n(excluding Mondays), start 7.30 pm and\ncosts \u00a34 to students and a fiver to other\nbod s. It's a good play and we really liked\nit, so get your arse s down there, if only\nfor the beer.\nTotty\nSibling Rivalry\nAppreciation of this film will depend\non the audience's level of taste. If\nits bad you'll like it. For example,\nthe height of humour in this film revolves\naround the removal of the last used\ncondom from a long term stiff (no pun\nintended)(honest g uv). The ale itself is of a sexually repressed\ngirl,-married to a boring man who has an\norgasmic fling with her husband's brother,\nwho (inevitably) croaks. Along with a salesman who feels equally guilty for a reason I can't remember, she desperately\ntries to hide the body before her\nhusband's tight knit family discover. The\nconsequences, as the synopsis inevitably\ntells us, are hilarious.\nNothing special is the best way I can\ndescribe this film. It is a mediocre\ncomedy that won't excite anyone to\nmuch, but will probably do quite well on\nvideo. It also goes to prove that Kirstie\nAlley should stay in Cheers, and that\nCarrie Fisher's film career has been in a steady spiral since Star Wars'. I'm glad\nthat she's having better luck with the\nwriting.\nPendragon\nHend-a Bike\nPETER THOMAS BICYCLE\nREPAIRS\nSALES\nAND ACCESSORIES\n4-6 Effie Road\nFulham, London SW6 IT D071371 S867\n\n"

    "content": "ULU's aid to Romania\nMembers of the Royal College of Science\nUnion (RCSU) are taking part in a relief\noperation to Romania this summer.\nMartin Heighway, a postgraduate student,\nof the RCSU is co-ordinating the\nmobil is ation of twelve helpers to Zvoristia\nMoldavia. These volunteers will work in\nan orphanage for mentally handicapped\nchildren which is over crowded and\ncontains mant children with the AIDS\nvirus.\nThe aid organisation 'Romania Aid UK'\ncontacted the RCSU through a St Johns\nambulance group from University of\nLondon Union which requested fifteen\nvolunteers, but to date almost thirty\npeople have come forward. Mr Heighway\nintends to take up to twelve volunteers to\nRomania using union mini-buses. The\ngroup will set out late on the evening of\nFriday 12th July and the itself will take\nup to three days covering two thousand\nmiles each way. The group plans to take\none rest day before starting work in the\norphanage and the drivers will return to\nLondon within a week, leaving the\nremaining volunteers in Romania for up\nto several weeks.\nMr Heighway stressed that the purpose\nof the operation was not to take in\nsupplies but to actually work in the\norphanage. The minibuses will be\ncarrying paint and cuddly toys in addition\nto people and their belongings. The paint\nis to improve the internal environment of\nthe buildings and the toys will help in the\ncare of the children as the main aim of\nthe operation is to improve the\nenvironment of the orphanage and add a little humanity to lives of the children in\nthem.\nRelief in the guise of supplies is of no\nuse to Romania's orphans said Mr\nHeighway, and he told of a recent\nconvoy from the German section of St\nJohns ambulance which was packed with\nprovisions that was refused entry at the\nRomanian border. He said that there\nwere incidences of relief supplies ending\nup on the Romanian black market, as had\nbeen widely reported in the national\npress.\nApart from helping in the orphanage,\nwhich is the main objective of the trip,\nthe group also plans to make contact with\nthe local universities. They hope to\nencourage university members to play a more active role in the care of children\nin the orphanage.\nPart of Mr Heighway's responsibilities\nas transport officer is to search for\nsponsorship to contribute to the trip's considerable travel costs. The operation\nhas already received \u00a31000 sponsorship\nfrom IC Rag. On behalf of the RCSU, Mr\nHeighway said 'we're very grateful'.\nPotential sponsors should contact Mr\nHeighway through the RCSU, office on\n071 225 8675.\nThe driving force behind the relief operation\nIn Brief\n\u2022 Be it Theft A student living on the second floor of\nthe New Hostel, Beit Hall, was burgled\nlast Friday afternoon. The student left his\nroom unlocked while he cooked in the\nkitchen at the end of second floor\ncorridor. His wallet was removed from\nhis room and its contents emptied out on\nthe floor of the men's toilets nearby, the\nmoney being taken. College security said\nthat they knew nothing of the incident.\n\u2022 Promotion Dr Anne Dell, a reader in the\nbiochemistry department, has been made\na professor. Dr Dell studied for her first\ndegree in chemistry at the University of\nWestern Australia and continued with a Phd. at Cambridge. Speaking yesterday,\nDr Dell said she was 'very happy' with\nher appointment, which will take effect\nfrom October.\nDr Dell's research is funded by the\nMedical Research Council and recent\nwork on tissue plasm in o gen activator has\nresulted in its successful use in the\ntreatment of heart attacks.\n\u2022 BOC New Deal? Mr Ian Greaves, the purchasing manager\nat IC, is examining new proposals for the\npayment of IC's annual gas bill. Until\nrecently Imperial was part of a blanket\nagreement made between BOC and\nBritish universities. According to Mr\nGreaves this contract meant that 'big guys\npropped up little guys', so that major\nusers such as Imperial and University\nCollege paid slightly more for their gas\nand thereby sub sidi sed smaller scale\ncustomers.\nBOC has presented restructuring\nproposals that still keep the universities\nunder one umbrella, although the larger\nsubscribers have their costs reduced at\nthe expense of the smaller ones. Mr\nGreaves said that he would have to make\na 'more comprehensive evaluation' of the\nplan before he decided whether to accept\nit or not.\n\u2022 MBA Fees Up The Management School's MSc course in\nManagement has been retitled the MBA\nin Management. Mr Roger Betts, the\ncourse director, said that the change in\ntitle was not related to the increase in\ncourse fees from \u00a33,500 to \u00a34,500. He\nsaid that the decision to raise the fees\nwas made last October while the\nre title ment was only confirmed within the\nlast six weeks.\nMr Betts said that the current fee level\nwas on a par with other MBA courses. He\nadded that the term 'MBA' was a 'better\ntitle' for the course, reflecting its broad-based nature as opposed to the more\nspecialised nature of MSc courses.\n\n"

    "content": "The Sarah Jamboree Night Out\n-Camden Underworld 27/5/91\nMLSIC Dr Phibes\n-Camden Underworld\n31/5/91\nThis is weird shit, weird shit for weird\npeople. The kind of people that think\nbugger inga Rhino with a ten foot pole is\nfun. Not the kind of people that go to\nconcerts and stand rock like in a swirling\nmass of people.\nState of Grace were good, though not\nthat good, she sounded like the singer\nfrom Throwing Muses. Kingmaker were\nbetter, three men, two guitars and a drummer from Hull. A good drummer\nfrom Hull.\nDr. Phibes came on stage and began.\nWell, they didn't really begin, more like\nthey happened. He looked out, out past\nthe crowd to somewhere I can only\nguess. What he saw I cannot say, what I saw I can and will.\nThey played for an hour, each song (if\nsuch a conventional word can be used)\nbleeding into the next. The hiss and\nscream of the previous numbers death\ngrowing into the giant cacophony of the\nnext momentous creation.\nEach number was more like a feeling,\nthe melody changing subtly throughout\nits glorious life, moving from the height\nof exultation to the mellow depths of\ncontemplation.\nSugerblast, the only recognisable 'song',\ncaptured the entire set in five minutes.\nThe slow intro hiding the more v aga riou s middle and the positively manic ending.\nThis is brilliant weird shit, and anybody\nthat knows me knows I'm weird too.\nPebbles\nPixies\n-Planet of Sound 12\"\nWhere Pixies go ape-shit heavy metal in\nthe old garage in downtown New Yawk\nwhere the old Sonic Youth used to jam.\nPowerchords a go-go throb and even\nthough they've become mad metal\nmuth as y 'know it's still Pixies due to the\ndiscordant noises which keep popping up.\nKerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrunch!! Melodies\nremain, sublet ies do not. Rat-a tat-tat.\nPixies rock you like you're gonna die\ntomorrow and I wish it could be 1965\nagain! Summer! Sea! 1966 it's Eight Miles\nHigh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,\nyeah, Pixies are cool. I wanna be in\nAC/DO. No I don't, blah, blah, blah, yeah,\nyeah, yeah. The other three songs on the\nrecord are very nice too. One is sung in\nSpanish. Pixies, where it ain't heavy to be\nhard.\nDominic\nSpitting fire and venom the band take the\nstage dressed to the nines in red and\nblack drapes, brushing good to the winds\nand throwing freshly decapitated babies\ninto the audience for them to abuse in\npost-gig satanic rituals. Coming on stage\nto the tune of Wagner they deliver post-apo clay ps e brimstone rock .sounding like\na mixture of Slayer and the MC5, into a crowd of baying zombies eager to suck\nthe life-force from anything living. Except\nnone of the bands tonight do anything\nremotely like this. It's so easy to slag off\nbands on Sarah records, especially when\nyou've never heard any of them (like\nme), and accuse them of being an ally retentive C86 indie kids. Tohight Sarah\nopened my eyes.\nFirst up were the Sweetest Ache who\ndidn't bode too well at first, appearance\nwise, staring at their feet, no movement\netc.. but soon their music took over.\nThough they had the little boy lost lyrics\n(I'm so sad, I have no girlfriend, I'm going\nto sit in the rain and have a cigarette) the\nmusic came head on like across between\nSpacemen 3 at the height of their drone-rock phase meeting A.R. Kane's'69' in\nblissful oceanic splendour. Most definitely\nhead music for bright, sun-blenched\ndo per s. Unfortunately The Wake, who followed,\nwere not good. They produced a murky\nblend of indie-pop meets the far f as a organ-for a change- and ended up\nsounding like a bad House Of Love\n(believe me its possible). This is the sort\nBlack -Black LP\nClose your eyes.at the end of the\nsentence nat ch. pick a number between 1\nand 3,open your eyes and see which\nreview you have.\n(1) I don't normally judge a record by its\nsleeve,but this sleeve is so bad I never\nactually bothered to play the record.\n(2) They really are complete bollocks\naren't they?Not that I actually listened to\nthe record.\n(3) My pet iguana shat all over the record\nbefore I could play it.\nDominic\nof music The Pastels did a million times\nbetter five years ago. The singer, who\ncan't sing, lets out occasional primal\nscreams to no effect. The whole set-up\nlacks urgency or insist en cy. Only on their\nlast song, where they rock-out,are the\nurgency and desperation inherent in the\nscreams made to seem real. Throughout\nonly the sexy maiden in shiny black PVC\non the keyboards is the only one to\nshimmer.\nFinally The Orchids take the stage.\nWith three guitarists they certainly have\nthe means to create a wider, richer\ntexture of sounds. The singer has a much\npop pier voice, though he has little stage\npresence, and the songs are much more\njaunty and uplifting than those of The\nWake. More so the band themselves are\ninto what they're playing and\ncorrespondingly the audience respond.\nOne song sounds like where 90's guitar\npop meets The Byrds (surprise! surprise!)\nplaying Dylan's 'It's All Over Now.Baby\nBlue'. The energy is vibrant in all the\nsongs and there is a cool piano sound\npopping up on several tracks. The band is\nunafraid to rock-out and are convincing\nevery time they do, either in short\nstaccato-sharp bursts or for more\nsustained periods coming over all\nMudTjoney-like on us (though a bit\ncleaner;we're on Sarah we are!). As\nsomeone semi-famous once said:\"Two out\nof three ain't bad\". Tonight I entered a heretic and left a convert.\nDominic\nJefferson\nAirhead\n-Scrap Happy 7\"\nWhy?\nWhy what?\nWhy do the record companies send us\nstuff like this piece of sixties quiche, er,\nkitchen, er, kitsch from a band with its\nhead so far up some hippy's arse it's beyond hope?\nWhy don't they send us something good\nlike New Kids On The Block's new single\nor something?\nWhy do they sign bands like this, given\nthe fact that they are paid not to have a large piece of edam in their ears?\nWhy did our esteemed ents chairman\ndecide that this excuse for a band should\nbe deemed fit to play on the ONLY band\nnight this term?\nWhy don't Jefferson Airhead just leave\nus alone?\nAnswers on a cuttlefish to the Felix\noffice. The first correct answer out of the\nbudgie cage will win this single, if you\nwant it.\nScrap Happy? Crap Crappy more like.\nGo away you annoying band.\nLise Yates\n\n"
