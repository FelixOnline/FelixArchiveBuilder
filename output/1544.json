Hydra will publish science\n\ufb01ction, fantasy and horror; Alibi will\npublish mystery \ufb01ction; Loveswept\nwill publish romantic \ufb01ction; and\nFlirt will focus on \u201cNew Adult\u201d work.\nhe terms of the contracts o\ufb00ered\nby the imprints have, however, been\ncriticised by author groups and industry experts. Sample contracts\nindicate that the new imprints will\nnot pay authors advances and, while\no\ufb00ering a larger share of pro\ufb01ts \u2013\n\ufb01fty per cent \u2013 than others usually\ndo, royalties will only be calculated\nafter fees for cover design and marketing are subtracted. hese costs are\nnormally fully covered by traditional\npublishers. he imprints also ask for\nall worldwide rights for the length of\na work\u2019s copyright. his means that\nauthors will be unable to re-sell their\nmanuscripts and that they lose control over any potential foreign language translations and adaptations to\nother mediums \u2013 such as \ufb01lm.\nhe Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) organisation\nhas removed Hydra from its list of accredited publishers since it breaches\nits requirement of o\ufb00ering advances.\nWriting on his blog SFWA president\nJohn Scalzi advised writers: \u201chis is a\nhorrendously bad deal and if you are\never o\ufb00ered something like it, you\nshould run away as fast as your legs\nor other conveyances will carry you\u201d.\nRandom House rejected the criti-cisms, sending a letter to SFWA\nmembers claiming that \u201cHydra o\ufb00ers\na di\ufb00erent \u2013 but potentially lucrative \u2013 publishing model for authors:\na pro\ufb01t share\u201d.

    "content": "FEATURES\nFeatures Editors: Stephen Smith,\nCaroline Wood\nfelix@imperial.ac.uk\n10 FRIDAY 15 MARCH\nA Love for business\ns I walk into the airy\nBusiness School on time\nfor a meeting (for once),\nI wonder where any of\ufb01ces could be. Having\nsnuck in by nefarious means, attempting to be clandestine as I tailgate an\nunsuspecting accomplice, I realise\nthat the furthest I\u2019ve ever been into\nthe Business School is the caf\u00e9.\nColin Love is a slight rarity really.\nHe\u2019s friendly, speaks his mind, and\nis honest: Paxman would be a bit\nshocked when he just answers a question straight. If titles were gold, he\u2019d\nhave Fort Knox in his o\ufb03ce some-where. He is: Principal Teaching Fellow \u2013 meaning his academic focus is\non teaching; Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Business School; Director of the MSc Strategic Marketing;\nMarketing Director for the Business\nSchool.\n\u201cMy big focus is going to be on recruitment for the Business School,\nand developing a social media strat-egy, which I think is going to revolu-tionise the way we talk to students.\u201d\nHe explains this is because \u201cwe know\nthat students only want to be spoken\nto really through social media... not\nbrochures and posters\u201d.\nHe is very exited about the new project that the Business School have.\n\u201chis summer in July we are going to\nlaunch a summer school. We are going to launch it under the heading of\nStrategic Marketing. It will to be an\nintensive, one month course. In total...\nit adds up to about 170 hours. It\u2019s going to be open to Imperial undergrad-uates, and international undergraduates.\u201d he course will be residential,\nand costs \u00a32000, which Love says\n\u201cbelieve it or not that\u2019s competitive!\u201d. he \ufb01rst pilot will have\nover 50 students and he is sure it\nwill be successful.\nWhy are you doing this at all\nis the next question I ask. Love\nanswers that it serves several pur-poses. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic advertisement for College.\nI\u2019ve got to tell the\ntruth: it\u2019s a revenue\nstream \u2013 we\u2019re going to make cash\nout of it. But the\nmain thing is\nthe College\nr e c o g n i -tion. We\nare heavily trading on the reputation\nof Imperial around the world.\u201d It\u2019s already been launched on the web and\nhas had 2000 hits in a week. He says\nit is open to Imperial students, but\nexpects mostly American, Indian and\nChinese students. It will be \u201cequivalent to three USA credits or 7 ETCS\u201d.\n\u201che incentives are two things: one is\ncredit from their home university...\nthe other thing you get of\ncourse is you get to\ngo to London for a\nwhole month.\u201d \u201cWe\nwant to employ\nsome ambassadors to help look\nafter these guys\nin the social playground\u201d. Discussing Imperial\nstudents he touches on the possibility\nof a discount saying \u201cI\u2019d like to\u201d.\nLove is proud of the Business School\nand its reach. \u201cWe teach nearly 3000\nstudents\u201d. On the subject of the Horizons Business course, he explains that\nthe 8 week programme has been lectured to 800+ students and is the most\npopular course. He says that this is setting them up for second and third year.\n\u201cIn the past we had something called\nBEST... I think that got kind of tired,\nand we\u2019ve done a major reengineering\nexercise with science and engineering\nscience. he new programme will be\ncalled Business for Professional Engineers and Science. We are extending\nthe number of subjects from \ufb01ve to\nnine\u201d. New options will include Business Strategy, Marketing, Sustainable\nbusiness, amongst others. hey will\nbe for credit and electives, with 15\nhours of face-to-face and \ufb01ve hours\nonline. He says that this is \u201chuge\u201d\nas they are expecting about 2000\nstudents to register for those\ncourses. He also mentions the\nintercollated masters that students can take.\nLove discusses the way that\nthe Business School can reach any\nundergraduate at Imperial. \u201cIf you\njoin Imperial College, as a scientist,\nengineer, or medic, when you \ufb01nish\nyou\u2019ve got lots of additional things\non your CV. You\u2019ve done a Business\nfoundation course under Horizons,\nyou\u2019d have taken a series of electives,\nyou may have taken a year in management.\u201d He says \u201cwhat we\u2019re doing is\ngive someone something additional...\nlike the humanities, you want to do\na language, that\u2019s a skill\u201d. He explains\nthat employers look at the business\nknowledge and that these courses will\n\u201cget them huge jobs\u201d.\n\u201cMore and more business people\nnow, when they look at CVs, they\u2019re\nlooking at personal statements, they\nare looking to see what people have\ndone outside of their specialist subject.\u201d\nLove ends with a tour of the Business School\u2019s online learning plat-form. It\u2019s pretty amazing and I wish\nI\u2019d had that as an undergraduate. He\njovially says goodbye to me. I walk out,\nrealising that I never did any Business\nSchool courses, and therefore can feel\nslightly hipster in a few years time\nwhen everyone is.\nDefinitions redefined at TEDx\nLSE\nTim ArbabzadahtalkstoColinLoveabouttheBusinessSchool\u2019splans\nLast Friday saw only the second ever\nindependently organised TED event\nat the London School of Economics.\nhe day promised talks, performances and workshops selected to encourage us to \u2018Rede\ufb01ne our De\ufb01nition\u2019,\nand it certainly delivered.\nhe \ufb01rst of the day\u2019s offerings was\npart talk part performance coming\ncourtesy of geek songstress Helen Arney. An alumnus of Imperial College,\nArney shared her theory that comedy\nand science are natural bedfellows,\nsomething she went on to brilliantly\ndemonstrate by playing the audience\nher obituary in song form, accompanying herself on the ukelele. his\nwas my single most enjoyable talk of\nthe day and a welcome reminder that\nyour degree can take you anywhere in\nthis world.\nRob Symington\u2019s talk was a breath\nof fresh air for an Imperial student\nlike me. He began by retelling the\nstory of how he \u201caccidentally ended\nup with a well paid city job\u201d. It was\nincredible to hear him describe his\nfear of revealing to his colleagues\nthat he was unsatis\ufb01ed where he was.\nFast forward a few years and Rob now\nheads up Escape the City, a service\nwhich takes disgruntled city workers and connects them to inspiring\nand ful\ufb01lling opportunities around\nthe world. Rob\u2019s was a story of fear-of-the-unknown and overcoming the\nvoice in your head that tells you to\nstay put. It left me inspired and more\ndetermined than ever to bin the career\u2019s spam that plagues my Imperial\ninbox.\nBy far the talk that left the biggest\nimpact on me was Kyra Maya Phillips\u2019s. As we \ufb01led into the theatre to\nbegin the third session, we were all\nhanded a pirate\u2019s eye-patch. It\u2019s safe\nto say few knew what to expect. Kyra\ndrew inspiration from two archetypes to argue that if we refuse to\nconfront and understand the darker\nside of our nature, we cannot hope\nto ever improve ourselves and the\nthings around us. It was the swash-buckling, plundering pirates who \ufb01rst\nexperimented with democratic rule\non their ships. hey were the victims\nof cruel totalitarian systems of rule\nand were determined to \ufb01nd an alter-native. Instead of ignoring those periods of darkness, they embraced them\nas a catalyst for change. he second\narchetype is the computer hacker, the\n\u2018people who can\u2019t \ufb01ght the itch to \ufb01x\nand improve\u2019. To achieve their goals,\nthey must \ufb01rst dismantle and understand the intricacies of a system.\nPhillips argues that we must take the\nsame approach to the parts of ourselves that limit us, the parts that\nscare and hinder us; our \u2018dark sides\u2019.\nHearing how this approach had\nhelped Kyra overcome depression in\nher own life was perhaps the most af\ufb01rming part of a moving an heartfelt\ntalk that left the audience rapt.\nBeyond the talks, the event was a\nvery slick affair. he team behind it,\nwho are wholly student led, deserve\nheaps of praise for putting together\na range of speakers that were diverse\nin content, background and approach\nbut united in the underlying TED\nspirit of ideas worth sharing.\nI for one can\u2019t wait for next year\u2019s\nTEDxLSE. Before that, however, Imperial has an independent TED event\nof its own...\nA\nJoshua Maxey Writer\nPlay Stairway to Heaven!\nWho gave me\nthese flowers?\nThis size is aver-age.

Yeah,\nI get it, I know, it\u2019s been\ngoing on for a while. But,\nhey, if we all just forget\nthis and say \u201cthis is boring now let\u2019s talk\nabout the email storm or something\nelse\u201d then we do a disservice to future\nstudents. It\u2019s exactly what everyone at\nthe top wants us to do: just forget it,\nget absorbed in our work/life, and let\nthem just do whatever they want.\nHere is a serious question: is it really\n10 million pounds to refurbish Evelyn\nGardens? If it is then that is surely\nworth it. 10 million pounds for thousands of students\u2019 welfare? It is a lot of\nmoney to us, but not to a big institution like Imperial. They made ten times\nthat much in just one year. Of course\nit\u2019s not as simple as that as they are\ninvesting in other things, but surely\nstudent welfare, and the chance for\nall students to be able to have a great\nexperience, is worth it? On the subject\nof Garden Hall, what more can be said:\na lot of students have got behind the\ncampaign. They\u2019ve really gone all out\non this, and the message to College\nis clear: it is the most oversubscribed\nhall, it is cheap and close to campus,\nit is what students want. You wanted\nstudent input, you got it.\nNew Campus\nThe new campus has been launched.\nThis is for postgrads only. Much excitement for all as BoJo was chilling with\nthe Rector and I was forgetting to bring\nmy camera card. The fact that I felt a\nbit underdressed aside, this could be\nsomething great for Imperial \u2013 that is,\nif we use it wisely. The aims of it are\nto built an excellent research centre\n(obviously, why would you aim to build\na shit one?) that turns research into a\nmoney making venture. Whilst that\nstatement may be so souless that it\nwill probably be cast in any new Twilight movies, it doesn\u2019t have to be all\nbad. Making money isn\u2019t in and of itself\nan evil thing. It\u2019s what you do to make\nmoney that can become a bit sketchy.\nIt is worrying as this ideology of making money from science could lead to\nmore catastrofucks like the Life Sciences cuts that happened two years\nago. I am worried that researchers\nwill feel on edge, and as though they\nmust immediately be showing some\nkind of amazing money spinner from\ntheir research. The truth is that science for science\u2019s sake often produces\nthat result. What I\u2019m saying is this: we\ncan\u2019t go bankrupt, but let the scientists\nbreath a little bit. Don\u2019t let them carelessly throw away heaps of money,\nsure, but don\u2019t straightjacket them.\nBUCS, Elections, and exams\nAquickwordonBUCS:itisn\u2019tbroke,why\nare they fixing it?\nThe elections are coming to a close.\nResults will hopefully be announced on\nFriday.

Good\nluck to all of the candidates that are run-ning.

There are some\nthings I still really want to do with Felix,\nand I am now, in public, pledging to give\nit my all for just one last term, in the hope\nof making Felix all I wanted it to be.

Set against the backdrop of\nturbulent Rome in the 1800s, this opera could well be equated with a modern Hollywood drama.\nIt is named after one of the main\ncharacters, Floria Tosca, a powerful\nopera singer who lives under the protection of the queen of Naples. Tosca\nand her lover, the idealistic painter\nMario Cavaradossi, are at the core\nof this story. We follow their misadventures over the course of the day in\nwhich their lives are upturned by the\nintervention of one of the most malevolent opera villains ever: Scarpia,\nthe Chief of Police.\nhe \ufb01rst act of Tosca opens on a\ncalm and quiet Roman morning in\nthe candle-lit church of Sant\u2019Andrea\ndella Valle, conjuring a romantic vision which will soon be broken. Tosca\nand Mario\u2019s beautifully moving love\nduet is all too soon shaken by the terrifying appearance of Scarpia, who is\nsearching mercilessly for Angelotti,\na fugitive escaped from Castel Sant\u2019\nAngelo.\nA special mention must be made for\nthe magically crafted set design of this\noutstanding production. he opening\nscene unveils the interior of a two-level church, illuminated only by the\nsoft lights of candles. he levels are\nseparated by an intricate iron fence,\nwhose door leads onto a winding stair\ncase that provides access to the main\nchapel, where on the left Mario Cavaradossi is painting a mural with a\nreligious theme.\nhe beauty of the scenery is surpassed in the second act, during\nwhich we are welcomed inside the\nelaborate Palazzo Farnese, Scarpia\u2019s\nheadquarters. Evoking the grandeur\nof ancient times, the stage is dominated by a giant sculpture of Saint\nMichael, contorted and menacingly\nholding a spear. his stage synthe-sises the drama that Puccini\u2019s music\nbrings to life in this second act. Mario\nCavaradossi is being tortured out of\nstage by Scarpia, who is ruthlessly\nusing every means possible in order\nto capture the fugitive. Tosca now\nappears trapped between the su\ufb00ering of her lover and the taut grip of\nScarpia. Torn away, she cannot but\nhelp her lover, despite Mario\u2019s innumerable pleas for silence.\nPuccini\u2019s music storms throughout\nthe whole act encapsulating the gush\nof emotions that take the stage. Rage,\npower, lust, despair and piety all rise\nand are subdued throughout.\nhis opera is of epic proportions\nand is not meant to re\ufb02ect real life,\nbut rather to deliver a condensed and\nacutely dramatic take on real life. It is\ndi\ufb03cult to identify oneself fully with\nany of the characters, although one\ncan feel oneself swept into the play; it\ngives us a taste of an extreme version\nof events, such as we would usually\nonly experience in a dilute form in our\ndaily lives.\nTosca\u2019s \ufb01nal act delivers a dramatic\nending of an intensity only matched\nby Shakespearean plays. As the night\ngives away and the Roman bells start\nto toll, we are shown a misty terrace\nof the Castel Sant\u2019Angelo. he space\nappears to defy any sense of perspec-tive, precluding an uneasy sensation\nof deception, which our main characters will share.\nHowever, without revealing more,\njust allow me to encourage any student to take an evening free to feel delighted by this enthralling opera.\nTosca runs from 2 \u2013 26 March and 9\nEnhanced interrogation techniques\nare not funny\nRocio Molina thinks you should\nD\nBoris Johnson\ncomissions statue\n\n"

Don\u2019t worry about food\neither, we know how hungry students\ncan get: there will be refreshments\navailable on the day.\nSo who is Radhanath Swami? Born\nRichard Slavin, in Chicago, Radhanath\nSwami faced a sense of alienation with\nsuburban life and its social injustices\nas a teen and, as you do, travelled the\nworld looking to \ufb01nd meaning and\npurpose. Now based in Mumbai, he\nruns extensive voluntary projects to\nhelp better the lives of people from all\nwalks of life.\nProjects include: \u2018Bhaktivedanta\nHospital\u2019, a free-to-use hospital that\ntreats the most deprived of patients\nand the Govardhan Ecovillage, a self-sustained eco-friendly village near the\noutskirts of bustling Mumbai. In addition to various other humanitarian\nprojects, Radhanath Swami also runs a\nprogram most students would appre-ciate: \u2018Midday Meals\u2019, which provides\nfood to deprived school children. It\ncan be tough surviving on microwave\npizza and cup noodles as university\nstudents, but imagine having no food,\neveryday. his is what \u2018Midday Meals\u2019\ntries to prevent.\nSure, Imperial students are busy:\nwith coursework, making the library\nyour home and dates to pretend to be\non, but this could change your lives.\nRadhanath Swami has been all over\nthe world, visiting Cambridge and\nHouses of Parliament to give talks\nand meeting with personalities such\nas Barack Obama and the Dalai Lama.\nIt\u2019s now our chance! Having also given\ntalks at companies such as Ford and\nbanks like HSBC, he should \ufb01t right in\nwith Imperial students, seeing as most\nof them become bankers anyways.\nImperial is home to countless projects and societies that aim to make\nthe world a better place. his would be\nthe ideal pep talk for your members,\nand a great way to explore new ways\nto make a greater impact (particularly\nwith society elections coming up). For\nthose that are \u2018just not bothered with\nall this charity crap\u2019: come along to\n\ufb01nd out why it is so important! Even\nRussell Brand thinks this man has \u201cgot\nthe answer\u201d! Inspiration. Answers to\nLife. Free Food. What more do you\nneed?\n\u2018Engineering a Better World\u2019 takes\nplace on hursday 21st of March in\nClore Lecture heatre, Huxley. he\nevent begins at 1800 and light refreshments will be served towards the end,\nalong with a small mingling session.\nFor more information please visit\nwww.eabw.co.uk, where you can post\nyour questions for the speaker. Entry is\nfree, but spaces are limited so we recommend that you register for the event.\nChaplaincy brings you an unmissable evening with His Holiness Radhanath Swami\nH\n\n"

Upon arriving in the ghost town that is Milton\nKeynes ICSC were ready to make their\nmark on snowsports history! First up\nwas ski racing, where Race Captain\nMichael Parkes was faster than a girl\nout of Metric and quali\ufb01ed top 15,\nready for the \ufb01nals. Our second skiing contester Tariq Shair tried whole\nheartedly, however he may have consumed a little too much alcohol to put\non a top performance. Next up were\nthe individual snowboard races where\nRoss Maske took the gold, Ed \u2018Hall\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019\n\ufb01nished third claiming bronze and all\nfour snowboard contestants quali\ufb01ed\nfor \ufb01nals. After great results in the Individual races the dynamic IC slalom\nsnowboard team were ready to take\non any opponent, despite the pressure on President John McGlutkin\nafter last year\u2019s devastating fall which\ncaused Imperial to just miss out on a\nplace in the \ufb01nals. After a tough \ufb01rst\nrace where IC\u2019s snowboarders just\nmanaged to grab a victory, taking out\nthis year\u2019s favourites, the next races\nwere a breeze and we quickly made it\nto the \ufb01nals, Where the attitude was\nkept it cool and racked up four more\ngold medals. For the ski duels IC did\nnot present a team as one girl had to\nbe on it! Next up was the most anticipated event\u2026 the Freestyle. Freestyle\ncaptain Mikkel Kranker inspired the\nboys with some inspirational words,\ndespite a major hip injury. his lead\nto John McGlutkin throwing down\nsome killer transfers, impressing the\njudges and Ross Maske starting o\ufb00\nwith some major bails (no worries\nthough \u2013 \u2018cause people are stoked on\nbails) but pulling it back in his second\nrun triumphing with a sweet \u2018back one\nmelon\u2019 and some gnarly rail riding.\nhus, both earning a spot in the \u2018\ufb01nals\u2019\nof the quali\ufb01er. he top 8 skiers and\nsnowboarders then had to compete\nfor a place in the actual \ufb01nals, forcing\nthem to put down some of their best\nruns to win the judge\u2019s approval. John\nMcGlutkin tore up the slopes landing a stylish and smooth run earning\nhim a place in the \ufb01nals. Odds on Ross\nMaske were good for a medal spot as\nhe had perfected his skills during the\ncountless Hemel sessions put on by\nICSC. He landed a super clean run\nwhich placed him 2nd overall. After\nthe competitions the spectators were\nin for another treat as the winning\nmale snowboard dropped a \u2018corked\n540\u2019 \u2013 just for fun. his concluded the\nquali\ufb01cations for south UK, resulting\nin 7 medals for ICSC (breaking every\nrecord) and 5 contestants making it to\nthe \ufb01nals in Leeds.\nIC snowboarding squad made their\nway up to Leeds (such a trek) to compete in the BUISC \ufb01nals. We arrived\non the evening of Tuesday the 5th of\nMarch. he night before the competition was spent in one of Leeds\u2019 \ufb01ner\nestablishments (Discovery Inn) where\nthe price per week is lower than what\nthe halls would cost in Acton. Both\nJohn McGlutkin and Ross Maske had\ntheir Birthdays on competition day\nso as the clock passed twelve a quick\nsong was sung and everyone was o\ufb00\nto bed \u2013 crazy night. 8 o\u2019clock was\nthe hour of awakening and a magni\ufb01cent breakfast was enjoyed at one of\nLeeds\u2019 classic diner/kebab shops. he\nLeeds snowdome was set up to accommodate masses of drunken students (rather than actual snowsports\ncompetitors) and as a results our\ncelebratory beers were con\ufb01scated at\nthe entrance (not entirely sure if this\nwas because John looked dodgy or alcohol wasn\u2019t allowed). hese precau-7 medals, snow big deal\nMikkel Kranker Sports Writers\nRoss Maske\ntions later made sense as the changing\nrooms smelt like a club at 7 o\u2019clock\non a Sunday morning and Manchester Snowsports (SKUM) had brought\nmasses of drunk supporters dressed\nas superman \u2013 the more the merrier!\nRacing was kicked o\ufb00 with individual\nslalom resulting in all the boarders\nqualifying for the \u2018\ufb01nal \ufb01nals\u2019. Team\nLoughborough\u2019s cocky remarks about\nhow all of their members quali\ufb01ed for\nthe individual slalom quickly vanished\nas Imperial had done so as well. However in the \ufb01nals the pressure got to\nRoss Maske and Ed \u2018Hall\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019 causing\nthem to fall over and lose a possible\npodium position making John McGlutkin the top imperial snowboard\nracer of the year (despite his motto of\n\u201cslow time or no time\u201d). Next up was\nthe team slalom where ICSC \ufb01nished\n4th narrowly missing out on a podium\nposition despite an immaculate team\ne\ufb00ort \u2013 nothing could be done however as we had the \u201cslow lane\u201d. Last but\nnot least, the freestyle \ufb01nals were to be\nheld were numerous sponsored riders\nwere competing. No IC contestants\ntook positions among the top 5, yet\nsome noteworthy highlights include:\nRoss Maske\u2019s \ufb01rst front \ufb02ip, yet he\ndecided to ride on a fall over a \u2018bump\u2019\non the piste, a switch front\ufb02ip on skis,\nthe winning snowboarding pulling an\nunder\ufb02ip and a hardway 270 in and\nof cause honorary Imperial student\nWilliam Tickner \ufb01nishing 2nd overall\nwith a HUGE method to \ufb02at and some\ntechy rail rides.\nhis has been the most successful\nsnowsports competition in the history of ICSC, so a big shout-out to all\nour competitors and let\u2019s make it even\nmore radical next year!!!\nICUAFC 1s on brink of League and Cup double\nHenry Garner Sports Writer\nAfter a long season, ICUAFC 1s were\nhoping to follow in the footsteps of\nDante emerging from the Inferno and\nPurgatory into the long awaited Heaven (minus a Roman poet as a guide\nand lasting considerably longer than\n66 Cantos). he week beginning 25th\nFebruary was the de\ufb01nition of make or\nbreak, with matches against Hertfordshire 2s\u2014placed 2nd in BUCS\u2014and\na LUSL cup semi-\ufb01nal against Kings\nMedic 2s (GKT [TK MAXX]).\nFirst up was the voyage west to Hertfordshire where bad memories were\nevoked. he previous year\u2019s \u2018playlist\u2019\nin the minibus featured too much Elton John as well as a Cypriot artist\nwhose name was unknown, let alone\npronounceable. he minibus had not\nbeen equipped with enough Valium for\nthe whole team to take, leading to half\nthe team struggling to come to terms\nwith their own existence let alone being in a frame of mind to play a football\nmatch. he same mistake was not to be\nrepeated: a blanket ban on Bi\ufb00y Clyro\nwas enforced and the bus was treated\nto a rousing chorus of the Gallagher\nbrothers. his led to all members of the\nbus being \u2018Mad Fer It\u2019\n, except for To\ufb01s\nwho bemoaned the lack of \u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 (Vangelis Papathanassiou). To\ufb01s perked up before kick-o\ufb00\nwhereby he declared his love for Crewe\nAlexandra and gave an interesting rendition of some of their popular songs,\nbefore asking what league they played\nin.\nA strong team was put out, with\nBjorkstrand completing the line-up.\nhe game commenced on possibly the\nbest away pitch the team had encountered all season (N.B. this is genuinely\nnot sarcasm). he opening exchanges\nwere about as cagey as the Bastille ten\nminutes after it had been stormed (ba-sically, it wasn\u2019t cagey) and Imperial\ndominated the \ufb01rst 5 minutes. hen,\nas Imperial had been accustomed to\nin recent \ufb01xtures, the referee awarded\na penalty to the opposition after >>47\n\n"

HA!\u201d is the typical response\nreceived when I mention hinktank\nScience Museum to anyone outside of\nthe West Midlands.\nAs regarding jokes about stupidity which Midlanders are the butt\nof, hinktank surely does not have a\nplace among them. Its passion to place\nscience in the spotlight, engage and\ninspire really comes across.\nAs a volunteer, I get to explore the\nmuseum for free, chat to behind-the-scenes sta\ufb00, have access to unlimited\nfree tea, and 15% o\ufb00 in the gift shop.\nHere\u2019s what I make of the place.\nMost exhibits do seem aimed at\nchildren. For the very young are Kids\u2019\nCity and he Street full of colourful playthings. For older children,\nand perhaps visitors less aware of the\nmedical world, a highlight is interactive Medicine Matters, which demonstrates surgery and invites the questioning of clinical policy.\nMy personal favourite is the natural\nhistory section, and adults may particularly enjoy the Power Up Gallery,\nwhich show o\ufb00 the majestic machines\nwhich used to underlie the Industrial\nRevolution.\nhe Planetarium is what every\nvisitor does not dare miss. Numbers\nin queues far exceed seats available.\nhere is usually at least one show\naimed at adults, but most are targeted\nat children. We volunteers put them\non and get to watch them for free \u2013\nusually the same on repeat. Being a\nbiologist and clueless about physics\nthankfully makes this interesting.\nDue to he Little Star hat Could\n(for under elevens), I now know what\nstars look like when they are \ufb01rst born,\nwhen very hot and \u201cangry\u201d, and even\nwhen they concede to death. hanks\nhinktank!\nFor the Planetarium\u2019s manager,\nMario di Maggio, there is no medium like a dome to engage with an\naudience about science. \u201c60% of the\nworld\u2019s population will be living in\nlight-polluted cities by 2030. his\npublic service is more important than\never. Digital planetariums \ufb01ll peo-ou might think that having eyes in the back of\none\u2019s head was a quality\nreserved only for mothers and teachers, but\nresearch published in he Journal of\nExperimental Biology has shown that\nit is also possible in tadpoles.\nBiologists at Tufts University, Massachusetts, have created tadpoles with\nectopic eyes along the length of their\nbodies by transplantation during early\nembryonic stages. Importantly, these\neyes were shown to be functional in\n19% of cases (a small but statistically\nsigni\ufb01cant result). Surprisingly, these\nfunctional ectopic eyes did not send\ntheir information directly to the brain\n(as the optic nerve does in normal vi-sion) but sent nerves to the spinal cord\ninstead.\nPost-transplant tadpoles that made\nthe connection from their new eyes\nto their spinal cord were able to ful\ufb01l a simple light-based learning task.\nWhen allowed to swim freely between\nareas bathed in either blue or red light,\nand given a small electric shock when\nthey entered the red zone, the tadpoles learnt to avoid the red zone to\nthe same extent as their normal-eyed\ncounterparts.\nhese results have potential signi\ufb01cance in more \ufb01elds than you might\nthink, from regenerative medicine to\nengineering and robotics.\nhe authors have demonstrated\na high level of brain plasticity, particularly important in their tadpoles,\nwhose brains must cope with dramatic\nmorphological changes during their\nlifetimes. he vertebrate brain cannot\nonly interpret visual information no\nmatter what part of the body it comes\nfrom and without a direct connection,\nbut co-ordinate behaviour accordingly.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective the\nauthors propose that plasticity of the\nbrain, rather than hardwiring, allowed\nthe animal to become more complex\nwithout compromising its own \ufb01tness.\nA more abstract parallel is drawn\nwith robotics and computing: could\nthis research be relevant to the development of networks that can adapt to\nchange or damage? Or alternatively,\ncan we learn from current methods\nin data processing to \ufb01gure out just\nhow electrical signals coming from the\nbody of an animal can still confer visual\ninformation? For example, when a signal is sent, it contains a \u2018header\u2019, which\nindicates where it came from and what\ntype of information it encodes.\nIt is clear that these new insights into\nthe connections between the vertebrate brain and body could propel new\nresearch in \ufb01elds from arti\ufb01cial limbs\nand regenerative medicine to engi-neering, computing and beyond.\nDOI: 10.1242/jeb.074963\nEyes in the back of your head?

Looking for a job?\nPedro Pereira interviews Adzuna co-founder Andrew Hunter\nhe eternal procrastinating tool\u2026 Facebook. Or\nis it? Adzuna, a social\njob search engine, has\ndeveloped a way to help\nyou get hired with a little help from\nyour friends. Launched out of a central London pub in July 2011, this\nsmall London startup, with over 1.5\nmillion monthly visitors, classi\ufb01es itself as the future Google for jobs with\na social network side. Not only that,\nthey search thousands of job websites\nso you don\u2019t have to, and even give\njob seekers access to a wide range of\njob statistics and data to make their\nsearch even more e\ufb03cient.\nPP: So \ufb01rst of all the important\nstu\ufb00... what kind of name is Adzuna?\nAH: \u201cZuna\u201d means \u201cabundance\u201d in a\nnumber of African languages. We aim\nto be the most abundant classi\ufb01ed ads\nsite on the web, and to bring the best\nads sooner than anyone else. Hence\nthe name Ad-zuna!\nPP: How are you di\ufb00erent from other job search sites? Can you explain\nhow the social networking feature\nin more detail?\nAH: Job ads are fragmented and too\ncomplicated to navigate. Users want\nto search all the ads in one place,\nwhich is what we provide at Adzuna:\na one-stop shop. We then make the\nsearch experience better and empower our users to \ufb01nd the right ads for\nthem, by layering on innovations in\nsocial and big data. he biggest misconception about our business is that\nwe\u2019re a portal where you can post ads\n(like Monster or Gumtree). Adzuna is\na search engine (like Google).\nT\n\u201c\nKeep focused.\nMake your\nmother proud.\nAnd all employees must\nwear flip flops\nif the temperature is above\n20o\nC\nAdzuna Connect is a social tool that\nallows jobseekers to see hundreds\nof job vacancies they are connected\nto via their \ufb01rst and second degree\nsocial connections in LinkedIn and\nFacebook. he average jobseeker has\nno idea they\u2019re connected to over 300\nrelevant, open job vacancies through\ntheir social networks. Also, over 90%\nof companies, large and small, are\nnow using social media to \ufb01nd staff.\nWe also provide users with rich, insightful charts and data on every\nsearch, helping jobseekers make informed decisions and setting us apart\nfrom the competition.\nPP: So who do you see as your com-petitors?\nAH: here are a number of other vertical search engines that aggregate\ncontent in a similar way, but we\u2019re\ntaking the market to the next level by\nbringing innovations in social and big\ndata to bear. Some sites are very US\nfocused, solely job driven, or simply\nout-dated.\nPP: How do you make money?\nAH: We make money by referring\ntra\ufb03c to certain jobs sites that we list,\nand from contextual advertising. Ads\nare listed for free in the organic index,\nwith companies and portals having\nthe option to buy premium listings.\nAt this stage we are purely focussed\non building an excellent job search\nexperience that people want to use.\nPP: What has been the most challenging time for the company?\nAH: Since neither Doug (the other\nfounder) nor myself are \u2018tekkies\u2019, and\nbuilding a search engine is a massive\ntechnical challenge, putting together\na crack squad of engineers to get Adzuna off the ground on a shoestring\nbudget was tough. It took us a while\nto \ufb01nd the right \u201cfounding developer\u201d\nfor Adzuna and we were starting to\nstress that we might have to settle for\nexpensive (and not brilliant) contractors and freelancers.\nPP: How did you overcome that?\nAH: We managed to track down\nGeorge Karpodonis (whom we\nworked with before at Gumtree), and\nafter kidnapping his family and employing a number of Jedi mind tricks\nwe eventually persuaded him to quit\nhis job and join us. George built version 1 of Adzuna and has hired an A1\nteam around him in Athens to build\nan increasingly awesome product.\nPP: Being a start up and all... Can\nyou tell us a little about Adzuna\ncompany culture?\nAH: We think it\u2019s essential to build a\ngreat user experience. Keep focused.\nMake your mother proud. And all\nemployees must wear \ufb02ip \ufb02ops if the\ntemperature is above 20o\nC.\nPP: Do you have any advice for our\nentrepreneur students when dealing with potential investors?\nAH: Be honest, open and make sure\nyou can deliver a clear elevator pitch\n(what you are doing, why it\u2019s interesting and how you\u2019re going to make\nmoney) in less than 30 seconds. If you\nare fortunate enough to be able to\nchoose investors, make sure you go\nwith people you trust, your interests\nare aligned and you trust each other,\nas you\u2019re likely to be working with\nthese people for a number of years\nthrough good times and bad.\nPP: What is the best piece of advice\nanyone has ever given you?\nAH: If you want to build something\nmassive and amazing, get something\nsmall and cool out there that people\ncan use and play around with as soon\nas possible. Don\u2019t be precious about\nversion 1, it\u2019s not going to be perfect.\nGetting early feedback (from real\npeople, not your mum) is absolutely\ncritical.\nIn a time where unemployment and\ncrisis have been some of the most\nheard words in our daily life, this\nteam shows that it is possible to see\nproblems as opportunities, and develop creative business models as solutions for them.\nhis month Adzuna successfully\nlaunched in Germany, the \ufb01rst stop\non its international expansion plan,\nplus revenues have been doubling\nevery 3 months throughout 2012 and\n2013, signalling a bright future ahead.\nIf you\u2019re interested in joining this\nyoung company they are currently\nlooking for interns passionate about\nonline and not afraid of a bit of hard\nwork. If you think you have what it\ntakes drop them an email at\ninternship@adzuna.com.\n\u201c\n\u201d\nJob ads are\nfragmented\nand too complicated to\nnavigate. Users want to\nsearch all the\nads in one\nplace\nIf you want to\nbuild something massive\n... get something small\nand cool out\nthere that\npeople can\nuse and play\naround with\nas soon as\npossible\n\n"

It\u2019s where your professors hang out to take\na break from quantum physics. Free wifi, yellow lighting and expansive tables\nmake it feel salon-esque (mais oui!) but a large cappuccino clocks in at \u00a33.83\n(mais non!). Coffee is served in bowls and can feel like it\u2019s got drowned in the\nprocess. BBB: the lemon tart (\u00a34)\nLe Pain Quotidien\n45 THURLOE\nSTREET SW7\nTHE ROYAL BOROUGH OF\nKENSINGTON AND CHELSEA\nUnquestionably the best coffee in\nLondon, probably the world, with\npaper cups you\u2019ll want as ornaments.\nARTG \u2013 the John Soames Museum is\nbut a short walk away.\nLike the Middleton hang-out next-door (Bouji\u2019s), this is all that is upper-mid-dle class, wholesome and masterfully untrendy in a cup. Cath Kidson likely\nbuys her artisanal bread here. Americanoes/espressos (\u00a31.90 for a double),\nmade with Union blend, are good; anything milky tends to err on the side of\nblandness. Only outside seating at the South Ken branch. BBB: the carrot cake\n(\u00a33.50)\nGail\u2019s Does \u201cquirky posh\u201d like the rest of\nNotting Hill (think mismatched\ncrockeryandheritagetomatosalads),\nbut makes it feel authentic. ARTG \u2013\nPortobello Market, at your peril; the\nElectric Cinema, at your pleasure.\nLowry and Baker\nYes everything is infused with the smell of curry grease, and yes there\u2019s no\nchance of \u201clatte art\u201d adorning your beverage, but Imperial\u2019s unpretentious offering is considerably better than, say, the national leading chain, Costa, (shud-der). What\u2019s more, it\u2019s manned by friendly staff, uses Fairtrade beans (see\nabove) and clocks in at a very reasonable \u00a31.37 for a small latte (student price).\nBBB: now we\u2019re getting contentious\u2026 the chocolate muffin? (\u00a31.09)\nLibrary Cafe Somehow serious but still funky, with\nexcellent coffee. ARTG \u2013 the rest of\nBrixton Village Market.\nFederation Coffee\nFernandez & Wells, 8 Exhibition Road \u2013 the Spanish upstart, this branch only\ndared open its doors to the Parisians (and, more reluctantly, the students) of\nSouth Kensington at the turn of the year. All black framing, hunks of jam\u00f3n\nand industrial lighting, this establishment is pitching itself as the (slightly)\nedgier alternative to its neighbours\u2019 niceness, and the staff can be proportionately diffident. However, its small-and-expensive-(\u00a32.30-for-an-espresso!)but-perfectly-formed cuppas are probably the best in Imperial\u2019s vicinity.\nWholemilk only. BBB: pastel de nata (\u00a32.00)\nA micro-roastery capable of reviving\nyou after a night in a micro-brewery.\nARTG \u2013 the Sunday markets, including nearby Colombia Road Flower\nMarket\nNude Espresso\nA reliable blend of affordability and quality, this is probably the best of the\nchains: the latte has punch and comes in at a neat \u00a32.10 (with no surcharge for\nsoya). All natural, all organic and more than a little self-righteous (the website has a well-being section, which includes nuggets such as \u201cto feel alive and\nrejuvenated, take your shoes off and walk on dewy grass\u201d; clearly the author\nhas not witnessed the syringes in Victoria Park). However, you can no longer\nslam it for being part-owned by McDonalds, as the US chain sold its shares to a\nprivate equity house, Bridgepoint Capital, in 2008. BBB: the \u201cLove Bar\u201d (\u00a31.50)\nPret A Manger So British there\u2019s a danger you\u2019ll\nbe sitting next to Nick Griffin, and\nworryingly describes itself as \u201cchild\nfriendly\u201d, but delicious nonetheless.\nARTG \u2013 the Heath\nGinger & White\nOnly if you have a pram and consider coffee a form of hot milk-shake. BBB: the tax advisors.\nStarbucks\n15-17 EXHIBITION\nROAD SW7\nCITY OF WESTMINSTER\nTHE LIBRARY\nSW7\nSOUTH KENSINGTON CAMPUS\n8 EXHIBITION\nROAD SW7\nCITY OF WESTMINSTER Fernandez & Wells\n15 OLD BROMPTON\nROAD SW7\nTHE ROYAL BOROUGH OF\nKENSINGTON AND CHELSEA\n19 OLD BROMPTON\nROAD SW7\nTHE ROYAL BOROUGH OF\nKENSINGTON AND CHELSEA\n23-25 LEATHER\nLANE EC1\nCAMDEN\n339 PORTOBELLO\nROAD W10\nTHE ROYAL BOROUGH OF\nKENSINGTON AND CHELSEA\n77-78 BRIXTON VILLAGE\nMARKET SW9\nLAMBETH\nPrufrock\n26 HANBURY\nSTREET E1\nTOWER HAMLETS\n4a-5a PERRIN\u2019S\nCOURT NW3\nCAMDEN\nWithin a bean's throw of Imperial A distant plantation\nCoffee shops close by Slightly further afield\nBBB \u2013 Best Besides the Bean\nARTG \u2013 Another Reason To Go\nence and is the domain of the prosperous middle-class, the connotations\nare distinctly less glorious elsewhere\nin the world. Co\ufb00ee plantations have\nbeen responsible for large tracts of deforestation in countries such as Brazil,\nand its cultivation has often notoriously been at the expense of local peo-ple. Western tastes for co\ufb00ee played\na principal role in the transportation\nof roughly one million African slaves\nto Cuban plantations alone. And because co\ufb00ee thrives in many equatorial countries with lush, volcanic land-scapes, where livelihoods are often\nuncertain, the industry continues to\nbe plagued with accusations of injus-tice.\nRecent research suggests that co\ufb00ee\ncrops, such as wild Arabica, are particularly susceptible to climate change,\nso the hardship faced by many of the\nsmallholders that the sector depends\nupon is likely to increase. A number\nof organisations are attempting to address this issue and o\ufb00ering consumers an opportunity to speak out with\ntheir wallet. he Fairtrade label, for\ninstance, guarantees that farmers are\npaid at least enough to cover the costs\nof production, which provides some\ncertainty in an extremely volatile mar-ket. Caf\u00e9Direct \u2013 the business that\nsupplies most of Imperial\u2019s beans, no\nless \u2013 reinvests at least a third of its\npro\ufb01ts back into the communities and\nbusinesses that it partners and makes\nlaudable e\ufb00orts to address its environmental impacts.\nSuch e\ufb00orts matter if we are to\ncontinue, like J. Alfred Prufrock,\n\u2018[measuring] out [our lives] with coffee spoons\u2019, and to avoid reverting to\nWorld War II substitutes like roasted\nchicory. An idea so alarming it might\nwell trigger a coronary.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n34\nWhich witch is the wicked witch?\nJohn Park Film Editor\nOz the Great and\nPowerful\nDirector: Sam Raimi\nScreenwriters: Mitchell Kapner,\nDavid Lindsay-Abaire\nStarring: James Franco, Mila Kunis,\nRachel Weisz, Michelle Williams\nhe Wizard of Oz may be a great and\npowerful man but Sam Raimi\u2019s modern origins story possesses neither of\nthose two qualities. Instead of going\nfor something grand and epic, Raimi\nopts for the easy way out, pouring all\nof his expensive budget into the scenic visual treat. here is very little\nfocus on building any kind of coherent story, and much like Tim Burton\u2019s\nhighly disappointing Alice in Wonderland back in 2010, the \ufb01lm\u2019s heart\nis in all the wrong places \u2013 which\ncomes as yet another letdown.\nIn the traditional Wizard of Oz\nstyle, the \ufb01lm starts o\ufb00 in black-and-white mode, as we are introduced to\nOscar/Oz (Franco), a womanising,\nself-centred circus magician/con-artist who dreams of not just good-ness, but greatness. After a string of\nevents that land him in a hot air balloon in the midst of a terrifying tor-nado, Oscar narrowly escapes death\nand ends up in the colourful land of\nOz.\nHere is where the \ufb01lm churns out\nan endless stream of magni\ufb01cent\nlooking unique features of Oz\u2019s nature \u2013 the trees, the \ufb02owers, the\nleaves, all the bright, vibrant colours\ncome to life more so with the extra\ndimension, and this head-spinning\nsequence goes on for far too long in\nfact, completely going over the top,\nspending more than the necessary\namount of time concentrating on its\npretty visuals rather than pushing on\nwith the story.\nMeeting him \ufb01rst is heodora (Ku-nis) the good witch, who then introduces him to her sister Evanora\n(Weisz), who clearly isn\u2019t a very good\nwitch. here is a prophecy in Oz\nthat a great wizard bearing the same\nname as their world will descend\nfrom the skies, will defeat the Wicked Witch and will restore peace. hat\nman appears to be Oscar himself,\nwho instantly grabs the opportunity\nto become rich and powerful.\nheodora truly falls for him, even\ndelving into a fantasy world of her\nown where she will become Oscar\u2019s\nwife and the two of them will rule\nover Oz as a happy couple. he sinister Evanora isn\u2019t convinced, and\nthe political power struggle between\nthe witches is further complicated by\nGlinda (Williams) who is so clearly\nthe purest one of them all, what with\nher white dress and blonde hair. Lies\nand deceit tear these individuals\napart, and eventually there comes a\ntime where Oscar needs to step up,\nand lead an army to overthrow the\ndark powers that control Oz.\nOnly that it takes absolutely ages\nfor Oscar to come to his senses.\nhere is a lot of repetition when it\ncomes to portraying him as a money/\npower/woman-hungry human who\nonly cares about the royal treasures\nof Oz. Okay we get that he needs to\nchange and as this is a Disney \ufb01lm we\nalso know that he will play the hero\nin the end but the \ufb01lm\u2019s narrative is\nbogged down by one too many references to the fact that he\u2019s capable of\nmore than he knows.\nBut when it comes to the \ufb01nale\nand linking everything together with\nwhat we\u2019ve seen in he Wizard of Oz,\nthe \ufb01lm does manage to establish\nsome clever links and use Oscar\u2019s\nbaseline skills to its advantage in creating a big showdown. His skills as a\ncon-artist he used so well on Earth\nare put to good use here, as are his\nsneaky wits. Franco does his best\nwith the very limited sides to his lead\ncharacter, one shallow, the other reformed and committed, but he brings\nenough cheeky humour into the role\nto provide some intermittent laughs.\nAs his sidekicks, the two computer\nanimated characters are absolutely\nspot-on in design. he China Girl\n(Joey King) and Finley (Zach Bra\ufb00)\nthe \ufb02ying monkey, though they don\u2019t\nexactly do much to contribute for\nmost of the \ufb01lm\u2019s plot, show what\namazing things tons of money and\nspecial e\ufb00ects can do.\nInfuriatingly side-lined however,\nare the three witches. heir relationships are barely explored, and\nthe dubious intentions that often\ndon\u2019t make a lot of sense are forced\nin to spice up the dynamic between\nthe three of them. Weisz, the obvious villain here, is disappointingly\ngiven a character too similar to that\nof Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\nin that she\u2019s obsessed with looks, and\nshe cunningly uses a poisoned apple\nto get her way. Weisz has a lot of fun\nwith her duplicitous trouble-making\nwitch, although she doesn\u2019t get nearly\nenough screen time to shine. Kunis\ngets the juiciest part here as the \ufb01lm\u2019s\nworst kept secret, and most obvious\ntwist turn out to be true, hint hint.\nWilliams is as lovely as ever but a\ntouch bland, and frustratingly without much power. here is a witch duel\nbetween Glinda and Evanora, one\nthat ends far too quickly without ever\nfeeling as epic as the trailers make it\nout to be.\nAll in all it\u2019s a hugely missed oppor-tunity, that cannot even make up for\nits thin plot with all the love for its\nvisual department. he heart simply\nis not there, and neither is the excite-ment. Everything may look amazing,\n(the big, grand palaces, the costumes\netc) but what\u2019s behind them is surprisingly empty and hollow.\n\n"

Mailing lists are forbidden from\nuse for the purposes of campaigning.\nPrince protests his innocence saying\nthat he has no control over someone\nelse\u2019s actions, however the Deputy Returning O\ufb03cers stated that he did not\nproperly dissuade Sheik from posting,\nas, before seconding him, Sheik had\nmentioned the use of illegal tactics and\nmailing lists as a reason to not second\nhim \u2013 the idea being that if there is no\nconnection in terms of seconding, then\nPrince would not be held accountable.\nIn the private Facebook conversation,\nsome of which can be seen on the Union website, Sheik mentions the ideo of\nunderhand tactics. Prince \ufb01nally replies\nthat it \u201csounds a tad risky\u201d\n. When questioned over why he did not outright\nsay no, he has stated that he dismissed\nit as an o\ufb00-hand comment and that he\nwas having multiple conversations with\npeople at the time.\nhe Returning O\ufb03cers have stated\nthat Prince had partial responsibility\nas he did not take the opportunity to\noutright say no. hey said that any argument over campaign team is \u201cmoot\u201d\nas they did not try to de\ufb01ne a campaign\nteam because \u201cany de\ufb01nitions will always fail\u201d\n.\nCommenting on the incident, Prince\ngave the following statement: \u201cI feel I\nnever acted in an unreasonable or reckless manner, so the severity of the penalty that has been imposed strikes me\nas disproportionate. It was never my\ndesire for Hamza to illegally campaign\non my behalf, a point that in my eyes\nis borne out by the facts. he expectations of the returning o\ufb03cers when it\ncomes to me stopping Hamza seem to\nme to be unrealistic, especially in light\nof that fact that the comments that are\nbeing used against me were made in an\no\ufb00hand manner in a personal Facebook\nchat conversation. When I discovered\nHamza had sent the emails, I was dev-astated.\nIt\u2019s not just the penalty that has\nstopped me campaigning \u2013 the investigation itself began on Sunday and\nwasn\u2019t resolved until Wednesday, covering a signi\ufb01cant chunk of the voting\nperiod. he only reason I am not appealing the decision is the thought of\nhaving to face again the stresses that\ncome with having the rectitude of your\ninnocent actions constantly scrutinized\nin minutiae.\u201d\nhe positions that seem to be the\nmost hotly contested are President,\nDeputy President (Clubs & Societies)\nand Deputy President (Welfare). President has four candidates with manifes-tos. hese are Becky Lane, David Goldsmith, Ali Ibrahim, and Forhad Matin.\nIn the DPW race, there are three candidates with manifestos, and DPCS also\nhas three.\nhe results of all of the elections will\nbe announced in Metric. his is barring\nany last minute complaints from candidates that need to be resolved. Candidates can still complain until 1pm\non Friday 15 March. Until then, the\nstats page can be used to procrastinate\nand keep up with how many people\nhave voted in such detail that even the\nworld\u2019s biggest anorak might be satis\ufb01ed.\n\n"

Leather was worn parallel to glimmering diamonds, shimmering\nsapphires and peacock coloured silks as,\nonce again, Rousteing worked his magic\nin toughening the luxurious and turning\nseemingly unwearable ideas into pieces\ncoveted by the nouveau rich. Prepare\nto embrace the gleaming new cult of\nBalmain.\nBalmain\nIt is almost a fact taken for granted now\nthat Sarah Burton will bring to each and\nevery fashion week the most elaborate\nshow, and this time round she most\ndefinitely did not disappoint. Where\nBurton\u2019s collection lacked in number\n(there were just ten looks), it made up\nfor in extravagance. Tightly fitted head\ncages replaced spring\u2019s wide honey-col-lector hats this autumn, implicative of\nthe womb and the protection a mother\nmight bestow upon a child; reminding\nus that Burton designed the collection\nwhilst in the last stages of her pregnancy.\nTo describe this season\u2019s garments as\nembellished would be a blasphemous\nunderstatement, almost every garment\nseemed to be constructed solely from\nglittering pearls. Of course, the collection would not be true to McQueen\nwithout exaggerated silhouettes, yet\nhere too Burton surpassed expectations.\nFetish-like corsets led to hourglass hips\nas angel-puffed sleeves floated above\ntiers of laced pleats. Somewhere between Elizabethan royalty and future\nsurrealism, metal fishnets collided with\nhigh-necked ruffles creating a truly extraordinary collection suited for such\nmiraculous times.\nAlexander\nMcQueen\nThe little sister line of Marc Jacobs may\nhave surprisingly usurped its mainline\nsibling on more than just the timetable of\nNYFW this season. The adverse weather\nthat forced the designer to showcase\nMarc by Marc Jacobs in lieu of the original Marc Jacobs show timetabled successfully ushered the 70s back into the\nlimelight.\nSleek A-line dresses complemented\nradiant voluminous hair as ravishing\nred lips boosted the elegance of blocked\ncolours. The looks were enticingly pol-ished, almost secretarial in fact, but with\nan added dash of confidence and enigmatic intelligence. Alluringly elegant, Mr\nJacobs showed that sometimes, the simplest ideas are the most effective.\nMarc by Marc\nJacobs\nBalmain\nMarc\nby\nMar\nJacobs\n\n"

    "content": "SPORT\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n46\nSaturday morning began with one of\nthe most eventful player crises in recent memory. With many regulars\nseemingly sidelined, ICUAFC 2nd\nteam skipper Dr. \u201cLOVE\u201d Wright took\nsome time out of his busy morning\nFrank Ocean-induced sex coma to\ngather the remaining troops for their\nbattle with \ufb01erce rivals Imperial Medic\n1st team. he 12 valliant warriors were\nalmost dealt the most bitter of early\nblows when their chariot of \ufb01re (Tell-ings & Miller coach) proceeded to limp\nto the Union 20 minutes late. Tim Beasley was close to tears, as the one time\nhe managed to get Jonny Hill out of bed\nwithin half an hour of departure time\nproved futile, and will no doubt never\nbe witnessed again (#TBtillidie). here\nwere no more unwanted surprises, although there was a feeling of loss in\nthe changing room when it became apparent that hom Samas would not be\nmaking an appearance.\nWarm up was concluded with minimal fuss, with resident pensioner Benincasa running his usual pre-game\n24km high knees. Imperial\u2019s crafty\nplan of messing up the Medics minibus\nbooking worked to perfection, resulting in the Medics arriving just 15 minutes before kick-o\ufb00, with just the bare\n11 men.\nhe ref blew his whistle, and battle\ncommenced. he \ufb01rst 5 minutes were\na notoriously un-clich\u00e9d cagey a\ufb00air,\nwith the all-important \ufb01rst tackle being won by Imperial. Some tactical\nconfusion was deployed by Imperial\u2019s\nPete Nugent, who informed his teammate with a shout of \u201cTIME\u201d followed\ninstantly by a \u201cMAN-ON\u201d\n. Vedat Ratib,\nwho received the pass, was immediately dispossessed. \u201cJoke\u2019s on you\u201d said\nRatib, to everyone who was listening\u2026\nwhich, as usual, was no one. IC soon\ntook an early lead, a \ufb02owing move with\nRob Maizonner collecting the ball on\nthe right \ufb02ank before drilling a low\ncross straight through the corridor of\nuncertainty and into the living room of\nchampions, where Will Wright got the\nslightest of touches to guide the ball to\nMyles Jarvis, gambling at the back stick\nas always, who struck a right-footed\nshot into the bottom corner. here\nwere mutterings of disbelief, as approximately no one knew Jarvis possessed a\nright foot. Nigel Jarvis looked bemused\non the sidelines: 1-0 IC.\nAt the restart, there were no IC\nshouts of \u201cit\u2019s still 0-0\u201d, which, as we all\nknow, is essential for keeping the leading team on their toes. Lo and behold,\na Medic equalizer followed within the\nnext 10 minutes. Dom A\ufb00ron, in between moaning about anything and\neverything, took an IC throw-in from\nthe left, with Dion Benincasa taking\nthe worst touch anyone has ever seen\n(ever). he constantly threatening\nMedic number 10 and o\ufb03cial unit,\n\u201cUzi\u201d\n, nipped in and applied the \ufb01nish\ndespite a desperate lunge from Andy\nSmith. Nigel groaned on the sideline.\nA\ufb00ron continued to moan, only a few\ndecibels louder. Will Wright\u2019s shoulder slumped and head dropped in\ndisgust, inspirational leader that he is.\nDabbagh shouted furiously. Moxham\u2019s\nscalp looked more terrifying than ever.\nAndy Smith may even have been heard\nsaying something. 1-1. he nature of\nthe Medic goal gazumped IC, as they\ncarried about as much threat as a dead\npossum up until that point.\nhe Medics began to build a head of\nsteam, knocking the ball around nicely,\ndespite the best e\ufb00orts of their number\n5, who was more interested in fouling\nthan playing football. A tense 15 minutes played out, but IC were never far\nfrom the game, and deservedly took\nthe lead when Maizonner received a\nlow pass from A\ufb00ron and \ufb01nished with\naplomb into the top corner, despite\ntaking 53 extra touches. 2-1 IC, and the\nhalf time whistle followed soon after.\nhe second half began well for the\nMedics, who had the better of pos-session. Two route 1 style hoof and\n\ufb02ick-ons presented striker Uzi with\none-on-one situations. Brap brap, Uzi\nmissed the target on both occasions,\nindicating that his name may well have\nbeen derived from his low hit-ratio\nfrom a large number of shots. James\nOwen gave his defence a good talking\ntoo, showing glimpses of the lairiness\nthat gets him into \ufb01ghts with fellow ICUAFC members. A huge let o\ufb00 for IC.\nWith Medics continuing to assert\npressure, Sami Dabbagh was lucky not\nto be given a court order for assault\non the opposition number 5, who he\nbrought down with all the re\ufb02exes and\nreaction of a gun enthusiast\u2019s trigger\n\ufb01nger. A\ufb00ron attempted to di\ufb00use the\nsituation by politely reminding the referee that he was \u201chaving a nightmare\u201d.\nUnfortunately, this did not have the desired a\ufb00ect, with Dabbagh given a \ufb02ash\nICUAFC dominate, just like the 1sts\nof yellow and the Medics given a free-kick. A\ufb00ron continued his eloquent\ndialogue with the referree, later calling\nhim a \u201cmaverick\u201d\n, with the man in black\nseeming somewhat proud of this refer-ence. It\u2019s always good to have a ref who\ndoesn\u2019t play by the rules\u2026\nWith tension increasing, Myles Jarvis\ndecided to step up to the plate, giving\nthe Medic right back a torrid time,\nsprinting down the left wing before\nsending a low cross to the back stick,\nwhere a gambling Rob Maizonnier\nconverted for his second of the game.\n3-1 IC. \u201cIt\u2019s still 0-0\u201d screamed Nugent,\nand, taking this on board, Jarvis decided to once again burst past his op-ponent, earning an IC corner. From a\nRob Maizonnier corner, Dom A\ufb00ron\ncaressed the ball with his right testicle\ninto the back of the net. here were\nmutterings of disbelief, as approximately no one knew A\ufb00ron possessed\na right testicle. 4-1 IC, game over.\nWith the rest of the match playing\nout at a tepid tempo, the \ufb01nal whistle\nwas blown, the ref proving his maverick tendencies by turning the whistle\nupside down before blowing. In truth,\n4-1 \ufb02attered Imperial 2s, but the win\nwas de\ufb01nitely deserved. MOTM to\nMyles Jarvis, who started his university\nfootball career playing for the Medics,\nclosely followed by an impressive Rob\nMaizonnier.\nICSM Darts Society is the only Imperial Club dedicated to the sport.\nShocking right? We consider it a sport.\nNot just prime man boob jiggle time\nor a pint of beer resting on a beer belly\ntime \u2013 darts is a game of skill, contrary to stereotypes. We usually play in a\nMonday night league SKADL (South\nKen Academic Darts League) which\nstarted out as a competition between\nImperial halls, but now includes a lot\nof previous students, and other universities around London. Other teams\ninclude the Holland Club, which has\nhad to \ufb01nd an alternative venue since\nthe club shut over the Christmas pe-riod.\nhe \ufb01rst ever Dartsity, an epic clash\nbetween the few IC members of the\nmedic darts society and the medics\ntook place at the Reynolds bar this\nMonday night. After every member of\nthe medic team was late, the order of\nplay was decided by the weekly Parkour challenge. For IC the Joker put in\na strong performance walking out of\nthe building on his hands. Female 1\nborrowed Female 4 and Crim Dog to\nperform a triple bridge, but unfortunately wasn\u2019t enough to beat IC.\nIn the \ufb01rst game which was 6 V\n6, IC started by pulling out quite\na lead. However after a later\nadmitted unlawful subtraction\nof 100 points from the medic\u2019s\nscore, they took the \ufb01rst game.\nNot feeling downhearted, the\nnext game went much better for IC\nwith the Joker, Spitroast and female\n4 taking the game. In the next game\nCrim Dog and Computing Chris were\nunlucky, losing narrowly to Patches\nand 62.\nWith pressure mounting, the \ufb01rst\nSingles match was Spitroast against\nPatches. he two quality Imperial dart\nplayers seemed evenly matched, until\nSpitroast hit a massive\n1 1 4 , a n d\nchecked out shortly after\nwith Patches trailing behind. Maybe if\nFeel the power, with Dartsity\nLouisa Byrne Sports Writer he had lived up to his name that night,\nhe could have caused a big enough\ndistraction.\nSecond up in the singles for IC was\nCrim Dog, who was having trouble\nstanding up by this point, and several\ntimes managed to not hit the board\nwith any of the 3 darts. Although\nwhen people weren\u2019t ducking\nshe managed to hit some pretty\nimpressive scores, she failed\nto \ufb01nish, and that game went\nto ICSM, leaving them winning 3-2 overall. After a short\ninterval of Crim Dog stroking\nSpitroast\u2019s soft hair, IC made a\ncomeback. Chris and he Joker\nboth made convincing wins to put\nIC 4-3 ahead. Unfortunately when female 4 met 62 in the next match, no\namount of buttons popping open on\nher shirt let the match swing her way.\nWith 1 game left at a 4 \u2013 4 draw it\nwas all to play for. As Coney unfortunately had no darts and was at that\ntime inanimate, Computing Chris\ntook on the Captain of ICSM. Computing Chris stormed ahead, but\nBrunt wasn\u2019t far behind. In an epic\nbattle to the \ufb01nish, Computing Chris\nclaimed the title for IC, taking out a\nmassive double 4 checkout.\nTo console his defeat, Brunt then decided to piss o\ufb00 the absent IC Alumni\nby snogging his cousin Crim Dog. See\nour Twitter, @icsmdaaaarts if you are\ndisturbed enough to want to see pic-tures. Despite being cheating scum,\nICSM darts still managed to lose both\nthe match and their dignity by being\nbeaten by the better part of their own\nteam, IC.\nMost people won\u2019t give darts a go\nbecause they think they will do badly\n\u2013 some of the performances of Varsity\nshow it really doesn\u2019t matter. If you are\nthinking about giving it a go, just look\nus up on the Union website.\nSami Dabbagh Sports Writers\nWilliam Wright\n\n"

Mr Howard commented \u201cI think the crisis has generated a di\ufb00erent set of questions that\nhave traditionally been taught in business school.\u201d\nhe hedge fund was founded by\nBrevan Howard in 2002, it manages\napproximately $39 billion. Last year,\nthe Sunday times estimated that Mr.\nHoward\u2019s personal wealth is about\n$2,2 billion.\nNida Mahmud\nLondon based\nHedge Fund\ndonates \u00a320m to\nset up research\ncentre\nLast week the new campus, Imperial\nWest, was launched at an event that\nattracted the London Mayor, Boris\nJohnson, and Universities & Science\nMinister, David Willetts. At the event\nthe Mayor and the Minister took time\nto have some hands on time with the\nCollege\u2019s latest research (including\nthe famous invisibility cloak) in an\nevent that attempted to display\nthe potential of the new campus.\nhe College used the opportunity as a \u201claunch of the vision\nfor Imperial West\u201d. he new site\nin White City is being described as a research\nand translation\ncampus. Imperial\nWest will also include accommodation for 600\npostgraduates\nand research-ers, with\nsome having\nalready been\no c c u p i e d\nsince September.\nhe launch\nevent, with 700 attendees, began with\nin the Great Hall with speeches from\nthe Chair of the College Council, Baroness Manningham-Buller, and the\nRector & President, Sir Keith O\u2019Nions.\nSpeaking at the event, Mr Willetts\nsaid, \u201cWe\u2019re used to thinking of London as a great legal centre, as a great \ufb01nancial centre, as a great centre for cul-ture, theatre and the arts, but London\nis also one of the world\u2019s great\ncentres for universities and\nscience\u201d.\nhe formal event was\nended with a speech\nfrom the Mayor in which\nhe laid out what he\nthought Imperial West\ncould achieve.\nHe noted\nthat London\nhas always\nbeen in the\ncentre of\nscientific\ndiscovery,\nciting the\n\ufb01rst TV\nset, \ufb01rst\nm a -c h i n e\ng u n\nand Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution.\nHe \ufb01nished by saying that Imperial researchers would make breakthroughs fundamentals of physics,\n\u201cwhy the heart goes boom, boom,\nboom\u201d and why toast falls butter-side\ndown. Mr Johnson also asked that\nsomeone explained to him how \u201cgravity worked\u201d.\nFollowing the speeches, the mix of\npoliticians, business leaders and other\nguests were led to a scienti\ufb01c exhibition in the Queen\u2019s Tower Rooms.\nhere they were greeted by a cake in\nthe shape of the new campus, which\nreportedly took 80hrs to make, and\na range of research displays. hese\nincluded ultra-e\ufb03cient rechargeable\nbatteries, microchips incorporated\nwith DNA analysis, synthetic biosen-sors and appetite regulation technol-ogy.\nhe Mayor was reportedly keen to\ntry the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d style invisibility\ncloak and both he and David Willetts\ntook turns to have a go. he cloak is\na result of the group researching me-ta-materials. he Rector had already\nnoted that evening that the ability to\n\u201cdisappear\u201d may be a useful skill for\npoliticians.\nImperial launches\nnew campus\nUnion Council\ncancelled due to\nlack of agenda\nitems\nhe latest meeting of Union Council\nwas cancelled as no agenda items had\nbeen tabled. All of the Sabbatical\u2019s reports are online and were delivered on\ntime, much like Ashanti is.\nTim Arbabzadah\nClari\ufb01cation:\nLast week, in an article about\nthe Big Elections entitled \u201cThe\nBig Elections 2013: the race is\non\u201d, it stated that Christopher\nKaye informed Felix that \u201cthe\nReturning Officers never replied\nto him\u201d. To clarify the meaning\nof this: Kaye was stating that\nthe Returning Officers had not\nreplied to his speci\ufb01c retorts and\narguments about the use of the\nwords \u201cQueen\u201d, \u201cfag\u201d and \u201cprat\u201d\nin a manner that he deemed\nsatisfactory. Felix acknowledges\nthat this could have been made\nclearer and apologises to the\nReturning Officers and Kaye for\nthis error.\nPhotos: Tim Arbabzadah\nEditorial: page 2\n>>\n\n"

A spokesman for the\nCollege stated that they were \u201cworking hard to revaluate the email\u201d but\nadmitted that \u201cit\u2019s possible we may\nhave to abolish this form of telecommunications in the favour of an in-stant-messaging service\u201d. Attempts to\nredenominate the email failed following the second of two storms. Unhappy students were seen taking to the\nQueen\u2019s Lawn to protest the collapse\nin web-based communications. One\nstudent tweeted \u201cIf Imperial thinks\nI\u2019m going to ask people things direct-ly, they\u2019ve got another thing coming\n#H8Talking\u201d, whilst another posted a\nFacebook message stating they would\n\u201crather quit uni\u201d than communicate\nface-to-face. Rumours that some sta\ufb00\nmembers, having long foreseen this\nslump, have routinely refused to accept less than 3 or 4 emails before re-plying, are, as yet, uncon\ufb01rmed.\nIt has been con\ufb01rmed by our sources that many male students counted\nthe interaction with female students\nas \u201cthe closest thing I\u2019ve had to sex\nall year.

Trying not to trip\nover his vestments as he crossed the\nthreshold to the chapel, Filoni was\nseen trying to ask where he should be\nsitting whilst adding in a tone of false\nbravado that he \u201cwas simply asking\nbecause he didn\u2019t want to sit in some\nnewbies place\u201d.\nSnow out for vengeance\nAfter a week in which warmer weather\ninspired thoughts of summer, snow\nswept back across northern Europe in\na show of swirling, white vengeance.\nReportedly angered by the presence\nof sunlight and the absence of woolly\nhats, the snow snapped on Tuesday\ndeciding to fall hard on the unsuspecting countries. Stating that closing\nairports was \u201conly the beginning\u201d, the\ncrystalline precipitation proceeded to\nallude to far more devastating actions\nin the near future, adding, ominously\n\u201csoon\u201d.\nShark-wrestling man fired by\nchildren\u2019s charity, hired by\ndolphin pod\nA 62 year-old man from South Wales,\nwho was \ufb01red after his employers recognised him as the man who wrestled\na shark in Queensland, Australia, has\nbeen hired this week by a dolphin pod.\nPaul Marshallsea, who was supposed\nto be on sick leave at the time of his\nholiday, was reportedly disappointed\nto be \ufb01red from his role at the char-ity, but said that he was \u201cexcited\u201d to\nbe joining the pod. he Indian Ocean\nbased dolphins hope that Paul can put\nhis experience in hand-to-hand shark\ncombat to good use in the protection\nof their newborn calves. \u201cwe saw the\nvideo of Paul fearlessly taking on that\nshark and thought he was exactly what\nwe were looking for\u201d said pod-leader\nsqueaky before adding \u201cand if he can\ntake out a few porpoises on the way,\nall the better\u201d.\n\n"

Well, as they say, there\u2019s a \ufb01rst\ntime for everything, and I booked a return ticket to the land of Humble-topia,\nand wrote a guide for anyone who is\nlooking for a holiday retreat over the\nnext 5 days, 8 hours, 30 minutes and\n24 seconds (note, time remaining may\nvary depending on when you actually\nread this article). here\u2019s not enough\nspace to cover all the tourist attractions,\nso here\u2019s my top 5 places to visit.\nC\nGAMES Games Editor: Ross Webster\ngames.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n38\nDynamite Jack\u2019s Caving Experience\nThe Sandy Beaches of Solar 2\nCrayon Physics Valley\nThe Super Hexagon Estate\nBeat Hazard Ultra Opera House\nIf you talk to anyone who has seen my\ncomputer or my YouTube history, they\u2019ll\nagree that I have a rather odd taste in\nmusic. Unluckily for me, Beat Hazard\nUltra happens to use the music on your\ndevice to create the levels. The faster,\nor louder the music becomes, the more\npowerful your weapons become, but\nalso the more numerous and scary the\nenemies.\nThe gameplay of Beat Hazard Ultra\nis rather like that of Asteroids \u2013 you\u2019re\nin control of a small ship in a confined\ntop-down area, and enemy ships/aster-oids enter off-screen. As you blow things\napart, you may get items to pickup, such\nas score multipliers, money, special weap-ons, weapon upgrades \u2013 you get the idea.\nThere are two modes of playing the\ngame \u2013 single stick, or dual stick. Single\nstick can be thought of as easy mode, as\nyou simply control the direct your ship\nmoves \u2013 the AI is in control of your guns,\nand shoots the nearest target. Dual stick\nmode sees your right thumb/finger control the direction you aim and fire, whilst\nthe left control moves you around the\nscreen. My phone\u2019s screen isn\u2019t exactly\nsmall, nor massive, but I find an issue in\ndual stick mode, because most of the\nscreen is now filled with fingers, and I\ncan\u2019t see what I\u2019m shooting at.\nI don\u2019t find the game too hard, nor too\neasy, so it\u2019s really addictive, and you rank\nup quickly. When you do so, you get to\nbuy a new perk, and upgrade it with any\nmoney you picked up on the way. I think\nthis game\u2019s awesome, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll\nget bored of it anytime soon.\nIhadheardandseengreatthingsaboutSuper Hexagon. You\u2019re in control of a marker\nthat you can rotate around the central\nhexagon. Lines and shapes move towards\nthe middle of the screen, and you have to\nsimplyrotatethepointoutoftheway.Tap-ping the left of the screen, rotates you anti-clockwise, and tapping the right hand side\nrotatesthepiececlockwise.Simples.\nI,however,seemtosuckatthis.Ibarelylast\n5 seconds before dying, and after multiple\ntries, I ragequit and need to take a breather,\nonly to get dragged back in! I can see why\npeople say it\u2019s a good game \u2013 it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s\nsimple and it has one heck of a difficulty cliff.\nIt might just be that I\u2019m rubbish at it, so if\nyou\u2019re a fan of this whole \u201clet\u2019s dodge lines\u201d\nthing,thengiveitago.\nIf there\u2019s ever a museum exhibition of\ngames that punish you for being a few\npixels out, or a half-second too slow,\nthis game should be the centre-piece.\nYou are Dynamite Jack, a guy who\nloves blowing things up, hiding in\nthe darkness, but hates getting shot.\nThe game plays as a speed-oriented\nstealth game... with dynamite. Blowing through walls can make your job\neasier, and lets you pick up crystals to\nreduce the time spent on the level, but\nalso alerts nearby torch and assault rifle\nwielding guards. As soon as the torch\nlight hits you, you\u2019re shot and have to re-start. It seems simple, but it\u2019s really kinda\ntough.\nMissions take place in a range of environments \u2013 such as tight tunnels where\nit\u2019s easy to slip around a corner, out of\nsight,andlarge,opencaveswherethere\u2019s\nnot a single piece of cover for miles.\nI was confused when I started the tuto-rial. I was a rock. A sentient rock. I could\nfly around space and smash into things.\nI thought I was just messing around,\nbut it seems I was actually playing the\ngame.\nThe game revolves around mass. As\nan asteroid, you can smash into other\nasteroids, and your mass increases. Increase your mass enough, and you become a planet. A barren planet, mind\nyou, so you want to have a civilization\non you, requiring more mass. Ramming\nasteroids now loses you mass, so you\nhave to stalk asteroids till they orbit\nyou, and then you harvest them.\nYour populace then sends out ships,\nplaces a shield around you, and you\nfight other civilizations. I didn\u2019t want to\nkill my people, but you can upgrade to\na star (and more, beyond that). It\u2019s fun\nwhen you\u2019re doing well, but it\u2019s easy to\nlose mass, and you\u2019re back to the arduous task of increasing your mass to useful\nlevels.\nI feel I\u2019ve only scratched the surface of\nthe game, as I\u2019ve seen screenshots of you\ncontrolling solar systems, and upgrading\nyourself to a black hole, so it\u2019s the top of\nmy list to play when the lectures are getting boring. That being said, I\u2019ve a feeling\nthe game is more fun on PC, as it\u2019s just a\nlittle too fiddly on a small screen. It\u2019s still\na great game though on Android, and\nalone worth the sub-\u00a310 that you can get\nthe whole bundle for!\nConsidering how you\u2019re at Imperial, I\nexpect that most of you have probably\nheard of Crayon Physics.\nCrayon Physics started in 2007 as a\nfive-day project, inspired by the Experimental Gameplay project. It won\nawards when it was first shown to the\ncommunity, and has been spreading to\ndiffering devices and platforms ever\nsince.\nYour objective is to get a ball to hit\na star, by any means necessary. There\nare often large chasms in the way, so\nyou need to build bridges or ramps to\nget the ball to the end. Instead of some\nawkward spawn menu, you simply\ndrawashapeonthescreenanditcomes\nto life, affected by gravity, friction, centre of mass, and so on. The graphic style\nof the game is that everything is drawn\nin crayon (hence the name), and the\nbackground is a worn piece of paper,\nwhich is a really nice touch.\nI played the game on Windows when\nit came out, and it was fine. I think it\u2019s\na lot more fun on your phone, as you\nactually draw the objects on the screen\nwith your body parts. The game isn\u2019t\nmade to be difficult, it\u2019s made to be fun,\nand fun you will have.\n\n"

Young\nand innocent, this girl did not know\nwhat to expect and this is the magi-cal, mystifying tale of what she found\nthere...\nWell maybe magical and mystifying aren\u2019t quite the right words, when\nyou consider that the long time ago\nhappened to be Christmas, and that\nthe Union Concert Hall in Beit really isn\u2019t that far away. But I digress.\nI shall set the scene. A young, fresh\nfaced girl considers her options for\nthe last week of term. She suspects\nthat it may well be spent in an alcohol induced haze, as the nights out\nand nights in when you\u2019ve drunk too\nmuch to get out continue. But instead\nshe \ufb01nds herself in a room thick with\nthe smell of popcorn and hot dogs as\nshe prepares to watch the \ufb01rstofmany\nexciting \ufb01lms she has been waiting\nto see. he rose tinted memories of\nthis night are \ufb01lled with the happy\njoyous laughter of those running on\nca\ufb00eine and sugar as they enjoy the\nincredible, emotional moments of\nMadagascar 3. Or the fear that \ufb01lled\nthe room at six in the morning as the\nsleep deprived enjoyed the delights of\nCabin in the Woods. But her memories are also \ufb01lled with the camaraderie of those participating in the\nevent. he half joking, half intensely\n\ufb01erce competition over the prime\nseating, those desirable marked out\nwith layers of blankets and pillows\nas the owners queue up for food. he\nquizzical look shared by all with the\nrealisation that the Sainsbury\u2019s basic\nchicken and mushroom pot noodles\nare vegetarian, but the chicken ones\nalone are not. And her personal fa-vourite, the three in the morning\n\u2018who can drink the most sugary tea\u2019\ncompetition with a complete stran-ger, whilst engaging in a conversation\non the comparisons between the \ufb01lm\nand the novel of Perks a Being a Wall\ufb02ower. And does she regret this deci-sion, despite having lectures the next\nday? Not in the slightest.\nBut this is a new term with a new\nall-nighter. his has been a good\nterm for the cinema, with three \ufb01lms\ndoing particularity well. First we\nshowed the romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook. I\u2019m sure it was\nnoticeable in many ways, one being\nthat it was a romantic comedy that\ndidn\u2019t make me want to run away and\nhide at the over repeated clich\u00e9s, but\nit also featured Jennifer Lawrence.\nAnd it is hard not to love a girl who\nfell over on the steps whilst trying to\ncollect her Oscar for this \ufb01lm. Next\nit was Argo. he \ufb01lm that, through\ncareful manipulation of the facts\nmade America look great and everyone else look a bit rubbish. But even\nknowing that, I was amazed by how\nmuch Ben A\ufb04eck made me care for\ncharacters that I thought were initially unlikable, to the point that I felt\nrelief when the ending that I knew\nwas coming from the start of the\n\ufb01lm \ufb01nally arrived. he last \ufb01lm was\nshowed that had the audience running in their droves was Life of Pi. In\ncase you haven\u2019t read the book/ seen\nthe trailer or even the poster, this \ufb01lm\nasks the question. \u2018What would happen if a boy was trapped on a lifeboat\nwith a tiger?\u2019 With stunning visuals\nand a great score (hello Mr Oscar for\nboth), this \ufb01lm was perhaps my personal favourite of the three. Now you\nmay have noticed, oh observant read-er, that these \ufb01lms have something in\ncommon. Each one was nominated\nfor the best picture Oscar, and in the\ncase of Argo, even won it.\nSo we took the common denominator of \u2018People like Oscar best picture\nnominees\u2019 and we stuck not one, not\neven two, but four into the set list\nfor the Spring All-Nighter. Lincoln,\nDjango Unchained, Les Miserable\nand Zero Dark hirty. After Lincoln,\nthat Americany, presidenty Spielbergy \ufb01lm you will probably feel like an\nexpert on American history. So what\nbetter way to test your new found\nknowledge with the history exam\nthat is Abraham Lincoln: Vampire\nHunter?\nDjango Unchained alone is worth\nwatching: \ufb01lled with Tarantino\u2019s\nsignature wit and chaotic bravado\nas seen in the likes of Pulp Fiction,\ncoupled with darker insinuations\nabout racism in America, the \ufb01lm\nalso features stunning performances\nfrom German dentist turned bounty\nhunter Dr King. Schultz aka Christoph Waltz in an Oscar winning role\nand Leonardo DiCaprio in an out of\ncharacter turn as a nefarious slave\nowner. Despite what you make of his\nrecent e\ufb00orts, Django is a de\ufb01nite return to form.\nWe\u2019ve also got Les Mis. his is the\nonly \ufb01lm I am aware of with a trailer\nthat has made someone cry, which\nprobably says something about how\nsad it is. And that\u2019s just the trailer.\nBring your wellies guys, the \ufb02oor\nwill be sopping from the tears of\ngrown men moved to cry by Anne\nHathaway\u2019s raw and unintentionally\nhot performance. We\u2019re charging \u00a31\na hankie. For the tears, you under-stand.\nWe\u2019re also screening Zero Dark\nhirty directed by Kathryn Bigelowthe \ufb01lm cashing in on the hunt to\ncatch Osama Bin Laden. Based on insider \ufb01les that may or not have been\ndubiously authorised by the US gov-ernment, the \ufb01lm follows the hunt to\n\ufb01nd Bin Laden through the eyes of a\nfront-line CIA o\ufb03cial as it gradually\nconsumes her life. he conclusion\nwhich let\u2019s face it, doesn\u2019t take a genius to \ufb01gure out, somehow manages to\nbe nerve-bitingly tense and gripping.\nJust ignore the mildly insu\ufb00erable\nAmerica Fuck Yeah! message and you\ncan enjoy how Bigelow\u2019s crafted an\nintense, thrill-ride of a movie.\nhe last \ufb01lm is famous for the number of Oscars it won. Best Vampire,\nMost Historically Accurate, Best\nOveracting, Silliest Fight Scene and\nBest Axe Swinging at a Tree to mention but a few. Wait, you don\u2019t remember these awards? Maybe it was\nall a dream after all. I did think meeting Jennifer Lawrence was too good\nto be true.\nSo there it is. A chance to see \ufb01ve\n\ufb01lms for the price you would usually\npay to see one. And a decent excuse\nto miss lectures the next day. So what\nare you waiting for, book your tickets\nnow. I\u2019ll see you there!\nLine Up:\n18:00 Lincoln\n21:00 Django Unchained\n00:30 Les Miserables\n03:30 Zero Dark hirty\n06:30 Abraham Lincoln: Vampire\nHunter\nhe Spring All-Nighter is on Tuesday\n19th March.\nTickets are \u00a310 online (until 4pm on\nthe day) or \u00a312 on the door. If you\ndon\u2019t fancy staying all night, tickets\nare \u00a33 per \ufb01lm on the door.\nFor an extra \u00a35, you can get All-YouCan-Eat Hot Food and Drink all\nnight! his includes the usual mix of\ntea, coffee, toasties, hot dogs, soup,\npot noodles and more.\nTickets can be bought from tickets.im-perialcinema.co.uk\nIC Cinema get the Red Bull at the ready\nA\n\n"

    "content": "Who run the world?\nEmily Fulham reviews a better Sex and the City?\ndon\u2019t want to freak you\nout, but I think that I\nmay be the voice of my\ngeneration.\u201d So says\nHannah Horvath, the\nmain character of HBO\u2019s Girls, in the\nvery \ufb01rst episode of the show. It\u2019s a line\nthat\u2019s come back to haunt Lena Dunham, the show\u2019s creator, writer and co-producer, who also plays the character\nof Hannah \u2013 in spite of the line being uttered by the na\u00efve, self-involved\ncharacter of her own creation, it\u2019s often\nbeen attributed to Dunham herself.\nFans believe the show is a raw, realistic picture of what it\u2019s like to be fresh\ninto adulthood in today\u2019s society, while\ncritics attack it for being vapid and self-indulgent. So, is Girls really the show\nthat\u2019s de\ufb01ning a whole new generation\nof young women?\nOn the face of it, Girls is nothing new:\na show about four twenty-something\nwomen, living in New York City and\ndealing with jobs, men, and life in the\ncity. he show\u2019s \ufb01rst series opens with\nstruggling writer Hannah being cut o\ufb00\nby her parents, forcing her to abandon\nher unpaid internship and attempt to\n\ufb01nd a real job. Marnie, her best friend\nfrom college, is working at an art gallery while attempting to escape from\nthe familiarity of her relationship with\nan overbearing boyfriend. Shoshanna,\nthe youngest character, is a college student whose biggest secret is that she\u2019s\nstill a virgin, while her cousin, Jessa, is a\nfree-spirited traveller with a penchant\nfor wearing transparent clothes to her\nbabysitting job.\nSo far, so Sex and the City? At \ufb01rst\nglance, it all seems pretty familiar, but\nwhen you get down to it, what di\ufb00erentiates Girls is its lack of pretension.\nhese are women just out of college,\nstruggling to \ufb01nd jobs and pay the rent\n(just how did Carrie Bradshaw a\ufb00ord\nthat Manhattan apartment by writing one column a week, anyway?) and\ntrying to \ufb01gure out what comes next.\nhere may be fewer Manolo Blahniks\nand Cosmopolitans, but what Girls\nlacks in glamour, it makes up for with\nrealism. And while Sex and the City\ntypically featured the characters dating a seemingly endless stream of\nmen, the relationships in Girls are a lot\nmore honest, from Hannah\u2019s insecurity\nabout her body during sex, to Marnie\nbecoming bored with her long-term\nboyfriend, and Shoshanna\u2019s struggle\nto \ufb01nd a man who won\u2019t judge her for\nbeing a virgin. he male characters are\njust as interesting as the women: Hannah\u2019s main love interest, Adam, may at\n\ufb01rst come across as a repulsive creep,\nbut there\u2019s more to him than meets the\neye.\nhe characters are often embarrass-ing, sel\ufb01sh, and at times just plain un-likeable \u2013 but that\u2019s what makes them\nso relatable. Refreshingly, these aren\u2019t\nthe air-brushed, glamorous women so\noften o\ufb00ered to us on TV. he show\nalso isn\u2019t afraid of dealing with di\ufb03cult\nissues: unwanted pregnancy, mental ill-ness, and, in one particularly excruciating scene set in an STI clinic, worrying\nabout \u201cthe stu\ufb00 that gets up around the\nside of condoms\u201d. However, the show\u2019s\nportrayal of female friendships \u2013 something desperately lacking in most TV\nshows \u2013 is where it really shines.\nAnd then, there\u2019s the backlash. he\nshow has provoked an almost unprec-I\nEvery Monday night this term, I\nhave patiently and loyally tuned in to\nwatch the latest episode of Miranda.\nAfter the past couple of series of goof-iness and misunderstandings, we\u2019d\nall probably had enough of it. here\u2019s\nonly a certain amount of anthropomorphic fruit one can stand. However, after having wisely kept o\ufb00 our\nscreens for a few years, Miranda Hart\nwas back on Boxing Day, ready for another season. And as the last episode\ncame and went last week, I \ufb01nd myself\nactually missing my Monday-night\ndose of slapstick.\nMiranda has a weird e\ufb00ect on my\nmind; a bit like watching my parents\ninteract with friends I bring home.\nInevitably, I can\u2019t help but observe. I\nhope that this time it will be di\ufb00erent,\nthat they will be cool and poised, but\nalas I end up cringing with embarrassment time after time. I doubt the\nshow was created with the intention\nof being such a tragicomic form of\nlight entertainment: someone wrote\nthe script with the idea that people\nwould be rolling around in laughter.\nEvery time Miranda exits a door carrying an object evidently too large\nto \ufb01t through it, or walks into a conspicuous pile of boxes, we are at least\nsupposed to smile, or giggle, if not\nlaugh out loud. Don\u2019t get me wrong,\nthere is laughter in Miranda, and lots\nof it, but it is not for the slapstick, because we dread her making a fool of\nherself, and dread is not an emotion\nthat gets us rolling around. So why\ndo we still love Miranda? Why, even\nthough we physically su\ufb00er when she\nslips or farts, do we still tune in and\nsmile with satisfaction when the sim-ple, cheerful titles come up?\nWe feel for Miranda because she is\na worse version of all of us, but still\nhas more con\ufb01dence. We feel for her\nbecause she is more digni\ufb01ed when\nher mother tries to marry her o\ufb00 to\nstrangers than whilst performing\nany everyday task. We feel for her because she does not settle for bad timing with Gary, but waits patiently for\nthe right moment to occur. Miranda\nmanages to give depth to a 2D character designed to fall over and knock\nthings down. She is a stereotype with\nan unapologetic personality that we\ncan\u2019t help appreciating, if not loving.\nIn addition, when she\u2019s not trying too\nhard to be funny, she is actually hilar-ious. She is at her best while pinpointing the \ufb02aws of her posh friends, or\nbantering with her bestie, and I personally can\u2019t avoid recognizing myself\nin her as she admits to being scared\nof peeing in a \ufb01eld at a festival. In all\nhonesty, don\u2019t we all wish we could be\nas cool as her as we fall over in front of\nTHRIFT SHOP!!!!!\nThe Miranda Effect\nGiulia Gabrielli\nTELEVISION Television Editor: Lucia Podhorska\ntelevision.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n30\nTelevision Writer\nedented level of criticism against Lena\nDunham. Some of it is valid: for a show\nset in one of the most ethnically diverse\ncities in the world, there\u2019s a whole lot of\nwhite people and not much else. Other\ncomplaints, such as that of Dunham\u2019s\ncharacter being too overweight to realistically sleep with the men that she\ndoes, smacks more of pettiness and,\nperhaps, anger that Dunham, at only\n26, is writing and directing a wildly\n\u201c\nsuccessful show in a TV world ruled\nover mostly by men.\nGirls is de\ufb01nitely a show worth\nwatching, especially for anyone worrying about the \u201cwhat comes next?\u201d part\nof leaving university. It may not provide\nmany answers, but it\u2019ll give you plenty\nto think about.\n(he second series of Girls is currently\nairing on Sky Atlantic)\na large lecture theatre full of people,\nor send an embarrassing message to\nthe wrong person? I know I do.\nYou\u2019re nicked\n\n"

Can it claim to\nrepresent the wider student body? Navid Nabijou investigates\nast night I was browsing\nhe Big Elections website,\npondering my choices\nof candidates. I decided\nto watch the Meet the\nCandidates video: partly because I\nwas getting a bit lost amidst the endless succession of na\u00efve and generic\nmanifestos, but mostly for the comedic gold I\u2019d been hearing about (\u201cit\u2019s\nknown that most young men will\nengage in an element of burlesque in\ntheir lives\u2026\u201d). I should mention at\nthis point that if you haven\u2019t already\nseen the video I couldn\u2019t recommend\nit highly enough.\nDuring the sofa sit-down with the\ncandidates for Felix Editor, our un\ufb02appable host Frank posed a genuinely interesting question: \u201cYou\u2019ve all\nhit on the idea that Felix is the voice\nof Imperial. Is not the student council\nthe voice of Imperial?\u201d\nhe answers were broadly speaking\nmuddled and light on content, be\ufb01tting of politicians on campaign. But\nthe question itself stuck with me. Is\nFelix a representative voice? Does its\neditorial policy re\ufb02ect the views of the\nwider student body?\nTo me the answer isn\u2019t obvious.\nOn the one hand, Felix is ultimately\nrun by a very small group of people:\nthe Editor-in-Chief and the section\neditors. hey basically get the last say\non which content goes in and which\ndoesn\u2019t. hey also get to prioritise\ncertain articles over others, by giving\nthem greater prominence in terms of\nlayout. All this means that in principle\nthey could choose to disregard input\nfrom the wider student body, and instead use the paper as their own personal megaphone.\nHowever in practice the editorial\npolicy is extremely open when compared with other newspapers. We\nview it as part of our duty to provide\nL\na medium for student expression, and\nas such we will only outright reject\narticles in the most exceptional cases\n(e.g. blatant racism or sexism). Of\ncourse an inevitable consequence is\nthat a fair deal of substandard material\n\ufb01nds its way in; but this usually seems\npreferable to excluding students from\nwhat is, after all, their own newspaper.\nBut despite this editorial openness,\nthe majority of students probably\ndon\u2019t view Felix as being \u2018their own paper\u2019, in the sense that they don\u2019t feel at\nall engaged in the production process.\nhe pool of contributors \u2013 though\nwider than the editorial team \u2013 is\nstill relatively small, with a few dozen\nhigh-frequency writers \ufb01lling the majority of column inches each week.\nDespite the continual (and highly\ninventive) \u201cwrite for us\u201d adverts that\nappear each week encouraging people\nto get involved, the unfortunate fact is\nthat the paper is by and large created\nby a close-knit group of people. To\nwhat extent this is alienating to others I\u2019m not sure (the candidates were\nalso asked \u201chow do you intend to stop\nFelix becoming just an in-joke for the\npeople who write it?\u201d so maybe this\nis an issue people have raised) but in\neither case it certainly means that the\npaper isn\u2019t representative of the students in any direct sense.\nWhat happens instead then is a\nform of self-selection. he students\nwho want their voices to be heard,\nand who care enough to put in the\nrequired time are those whose views\nare put out there. he rest \u2013 the \u2018silent\nmajority\u2019, to channel Richard Nixon \u2013\nget sidelined.\nAnd so in many ways, representation through Felix resembles representation in any democratic system,\nwhere \u2013 despite every vote being\nequal \u2013 the politically-engaged classes inevitably end up dominating the\ndiscussion. Which brings me back to\nthe original question: \u201cIs the proper\nvoice of students Felix, or the Union\nCouncil?\u201d\nAs with Felix, there is a massive self-selection element at play in terms of\nwho sits on Council; your average Imperial student probably hasn\u2019t heard\nof, much less cares about the Union\nCouncil. Consequently the kind of\npeople who attend Council and vote\non Union policies can hardly said to\nbe representative.\nBut they\u2019re elected by the wider student body, right? hat has to count for\nsomething. While they are technically\nelected, these polls don\u2019t take place\nduring the \u2018Big Elections\u2019 season (an\nomission you may not have noticed\nthis week), and so tend to have dismal turnouts; most people on Union\nCouncil hold that position by virtue\nof fewer than one hundred votes. By\ncontrast, the Felix Editor is a sabbatical position that is very publicly contested during campaign weeks, and\nthe winner usually receives a mandate\nof a few thousand votes.\nFinally, any student can turn up\nto the Felix office and get writing,\nwhereas non-Council members do\nnot have any power to in\ufb02uence the\nUnion\u2019s decisions. So Felix is crucial\nin empowering ordinary students\nto make an impact, inasmuch as it\nprovides a medium for bringing important issues to the attention of the\nUnion and sparking discussion within\nthe student body. And while it may\nnever be fully representative of all\nstudents, every student has the ability to make it more representative, by\nheading down to the office and getting\nstuck in.\nIs Felix a representative\nvoice? Does\nits editorial\npolicy reflect\nthe views of\nthe widers\nstudent body?\nOnline\nIn response to \u201cJulian Assange in\nSweden\u201d, 8th March:\nThis hero worship of Julian Assange is rather particular, but not\nperplexing. There is a creation of\nan enigma about the image of Assange, which is inconsistent with\nthe persona that is known about Assange. He is given more credit than\nhe deserves. All the information\nrelating to Assange\u2019s legal problem\nin Sweden is readily available. The\nirony comes in that glossing over or\noutright ignoring the circumstances relating to those problems. People are will readily point out that\nSweden gave Assange permission to\nleave Sweden, but also told him that\nthe investigation was on going and\nthere was an interview arranged before his left Sweden. Being a leader\nof a organization promoting transparency and advocating whistle\nblowing, it is strange that Assange\ntakes a different stance when it\ncomes to him. It is sad that Wikileaks has become all about Assange\u2019s\npersonal agenda.\nIn response to \u201cGri\ufb00on Studios, up to\nscratch?\u201d, from the archive:\nI would strongly advise anyone who\nis looking at accommodation options\nNOT to book accommodation with\nGradpad. I am currently a resident at\nGri\ufb00on Studios, and my experience\nhas been absolutely terrible and has\na\ufb00ected my studies. I really don\u2019t want\nanyone else to fall into this trap. Was\nmoved against my wishes to a di\ufb00erent accom to the one I booked Internet doesn\u2019t work hey lose rent\npayments All appliances in my room\nhave broken, takes up to a month to\nget them \ufb01xed\nIn response to \u201chere is something in\nthe air\u201d 1st March:\nYour comparison to homophobia is\nboth inappropriate and o\ufb00ensive. a)\nYour choice to smoke is not (in any\nway) similar to being homosexual;\nthe latter is not a choice. b) While\nsome people may \ufb01nd homosexuality\ndisgusting, walking past/being in the\nvicinity of a homosexual does not actually impact their health. You don\u2019t\nseem to realise that by smoking in a\ndoorway (which provides you with\nshelter), you are also increasing the\namount of smoke which passers-by\ninhale, and which enters the building.\nYou make a good \ufb01nancial case for allowing people to continue to smoke,\nso I\u2019m happy for you to do so in the\nstreet, but College is free to have its\nown smoking policy (and indeed as\nan institution actively involved in\nmedical research, it should). By the\nway, \u201cCollege seems to be on the anti-smoking warpath again\u201d is a bit of an\nexaggeration, considering all they\u2019ve\ndone is remind people of the existing\nsmoking policy.\nAngry? Write us a letter explaining why and you could be the proud\nowner of a \u00a310 note!\n\n"

She said\n\u201cBUCS has o\ufb00ered all current Medical\nSchool members the option to remain\nas full members of BUCS if they wish\nto, but operating to the same conditions of membership as all other member institutions \u2013 so all students of\nthe Medical School compete in BUCS\nsports for the Medical School, and not\nthe \u201cparent\u201d university. If the Medical\nSchool joins as part of the University,\nthen the teams playing can still compete as Medical School teams under\nthe sports management structures of\nthe institution. his decision sits with\nthe institution.\u201d\nShe also added: \u201che BUCS membership has been involved in this debate\nthrough the BUCS Advisory Group,\nand overwhelmingly agrees that this\napproach is reasonable both for medical schools, and to all other members\nwhich join under the same conditions\u201d.\nICSM are unhappy with the options\nthat BUCS have presented as they feel\nthat their heritage will be lost. hey\nfeel that they cannot accept either option as the \ufb01rst option limits participation of its students and that the second\noption strips ICSM of its name and\nrecognition since teams would have to\nplay under the \u2018IC Banner\u2019.\nICSM President, Shiv Vohra, said,\n\u201che BUCS situation is quite frankly\nfrustrating and shows a complete lack\nof understanding for what our students would like, which is e\ufb00ectively\nthe status quo. he lack of an appeals\nprocess for the decision by BUCS has\nleft us with no other option but to\nprotest against this and voice our discontent over the entire \u2018consultation\u2019\nprocess.\nWe will be joining forces with all the\nother London med schools (and Cardi\ufb00) under the ULU Medgroup banner to protest outside the BUCS head\no\ufb03ces on the afternoon of hursday\n21st March.

Burns\nStarring: Jude Law, Rooney Mara,\nChanning Tatum, Catherine ZetaJones\nAs a medic, I should know the most\ncommon side e\ufb00ects of any prescribed medication are nausea and\nvomiting. Brutally stabbing your husband to death whilst sleep-walking,\nisn\u2019t usually one of them. But that is\nexactly what happens when Emily\nTaylor (Mara) starts on a new course\nof anti-depressants following her\naforementioned husband\u2019s (Tatum)\nrelease from prison. She is nervous,\nconstantly anxious, and withdrawn\nfrom life, which is what prompts Dr\nJonathan Banks (Law) to try out Ablixa.\nLife is good again for Emily, she has\nregained her sex drive, something\nher insider-trading husband is insanely happy about, given her previous bouts of depression. A couple of\nharmless episodes of sleepwalking\ndon\u2019t bother him much, that is until\nhe gets a kitchen knife stuck inside\nhim multiple times. Distraught and\nconfused, Emily is still sent to prison\nand put on trial, with Dr Banks committed to \ufb01ghting for her acquittal.\nBut things become more complicated than that. To give more details\non further plot development would\nbe giving away far too much, but Steven Soderbergh\u2019s slick little retirement project (he has stated that this\nwill be his last big-screen \ufb01lm \u2013 he\nhas one more television movie due to\nbe released later this year) has more\ntwists and turns than what you can\nsee coming. And with every bold\njerk to the narrative, the less \u201cbelievable\u201d it may become. But with a \ufb01lm\ndressed as a psychosexual thriller, a\ncertain stretch of the imagination is\nentirely acceptable, and Soderbergh\nuses every opportunity to take advantage of that.\nControversy surrounds Banks\u2019\npractising methods, and soon he\n\ufb01nds himself in the middle of a much\ndarker conspiracy than he anticipat-ed. And with Law, Soderbergh \ufb01nds\nhimself a very convincing helpless\nvictim but one who is not willing to\ngo down without a \ufb01ght. He\u2019s an intelligent man who puts the pieces\ntogether quickly, which is a relief\nfor the audience as the \ufb01lm gets on\nwith its developments. And it gives\nour victim/protagonist plenty of time\nto set things right. Law does have\nthe satisfying \ufb01nal laugh in the end,\nsomething we all end up supporting.\nMara, hot o\ufb00 her Oscar-nominated\nsuccess from David Fincher\u2019s he\nGirl with the Dragon Tattoo, tackles\nyet another complex role with domi-nance. Hers is a particularly ambiguous and challenging one, but this new\nyoung talent very skilfully inhabits\nher duplicitous persona. Essentially\nthe \ufb01lm\u2019s biggest twist rests on this\nsingle performance, and she cleverly\nbalances the two main sides to her\nfascinating lead character: the chilly,\ncalculating, as well as the young and\nvulnerable.\nZeta-Jones, as Emily\u2019s previous\npsychiatrist Dr Victoria Siebert, has\nnever been this sizzling nor has she\nhad a role this fun and meaty in recent years. he fact that a seemingly\ninsigni\ufb01cant part is played by such a\nfamous name should give you some\nclues as to how much weight she\u2019ll\ncarry in the later scenes. And as more\nis revealed she becomes a crucial part\nin the bigger picture, an intriguing\npiece of the overall puzzle.\nWith its hazy, dream-like photog-raphy, Soderbergh is highly e\ufb00ective in creating a sense of ambiguity\nthroughout his scenes. He doesn\u2019t\nquite venture into the \u201cwhat is real,\nwhat isn\u2019t real\u201d type of complicated\ntheme but rather stays grounded and\ninvolved in the decisions these very\nhuman characters make. his also\nisn\u2019t too interested in having a go at\nthe pharmaceutical industry itself \u2013\nagain, here is a thriller solely focused\non its small cast who collectively deliver a stellar piece of work.\nhe plotting is mostly tight, and\nthe \ufb01lm does verge into the more ridiculous territory as it moves on, and\nhow everything \ufb01ts together with all\nthe big reveals will no doubt require\nmultiple viewings, having all the\nfacts straight. Whether everything\n\ufb02ows smoothly is questionable, but\nit doesn\u2019t stop the fact that this \ufb01lm\nis aboslutely bizarre and bonkers,\nwhich is just as well, given the subject it handles. And as his retirement\nproject, this is an entirely appropriate way to end Soderbergh\u2019s unique,\nmultiple-genre-conquering directorial career. He will of course be greatly missed from the big screen.\n\n"

    "content": "FILM\nFilm Editors: Katy Bettany,\nJohn Park, Lucy Wiles\nfilm.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n32 FRIDAY 15 MARCH\nDo they know som\nLucy Wiles Film Editor\nDespite only being almost a quarter\nof the way into 2013, these last few\nmonths have definitely been celebrating the film industry. But with the Oscars over and done with, what\u2019s coming\nnext? Apparently, a plethora of sci-fi\nand apocalypse films \u2013 are the producers trying to warn us? Felix Film\nhas outlined the coming movies\u2026 just\nin case.\nWorld War Z\nRelease Date: June 21st\nDirector: Marc Foster\nCast: Brad Pitt, Mireille Enos,\nJames Badge Dale, Matthew Fox,\nDavid Morse, Bryan Cranston\nBased on the Max Brooks\u2019 bestselling book of the same name,\nthis is the tale of how a zombie\nepidemic becomes somewhat\nout of control. Now a global pan-demic, the suitably American\nUN operative Gerry Lane (Pitt) is\nroaming all over the world in an\nattempt to discover a way to stop\nthis undead madness. he hordes\nof zombies have destroyed human\ncivilization, and are doing their\nutmost to kill o\ufb00 the tiny group of\nsurvivors\u2026 and Brad Pitt is left in\ncharge of saving the world. Clearly\neveryone is doomed\u2026? here have\nseveral problems reported in film\nnews about the making of this\nmovie, and the slightly lacklustre\ntrailer hasn\u2019t helped the image\nof the film. However, the book\nis SO good that the producers\nwould have to do something quite\nspectacularly bad to get this very\nwrong. So here\u2019s hoping.\nThe World\u2019s End\nRelease Date: August 14th\nDirector: Edgar Wright\nCast: Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Martin Freeman, Paddy Considine, Eddie\nMarsan, Rosamund Pike\nNot to be confused with his Is he End, this is the third (and supposedly\nfinal) film in Wright, Pegg and Frost\u2019s fames \u2018hree Flavours Cornetto\u2019 trilogy (aka the \u2018Blood and Ice Cream\u2019 trilogy) which includes the smash hit\nShaun of the Dead and the very funny, but somewhat gory, Hot Fuzz. A\ngroup of old friends (Pegg, Frost, Marsan, Considine and Freeman) reunite\nafter a few years for a good old pub crawl, which is set to finish at a pub\ncalled he World\u2019s End. Annoyingly, the world actually starts to end, and\n\u2013 such is their determination \u2013 the quintet must struggle through their\npub crawl via the apocalypse. It\u2019s looking promisingly good: Pegg and Frost\nhaven\u2019t let us down yet, and the odds are on that this hotly-anticipated and\nvery long-awaited last installment will also be a good\u2019un.\nThis Is The End\nRelease Date: June 28th\nDirectors: Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen\nCast: Jay Baruchel, Seth Rogen, Emma Watson, Craig Robinson, James Franco, Jonah Hill, Rihanna\nOk, we\u2019ll admit \u2013 we don\u2019t have high hopes for this one. A cast including Seth Rogen, Emma Watson and Rihanna?\nCan you imagine how weird that wrap party would be? he story isn\u2019t fabulous either, despite being conceived by\nRogen. A huge and very fun looking party is underway at James Franco\u2019s house, with a surprisingly A-list group of\nattendees. All of a sudden, a global apocalypse begins. Don\u2019t you just hate it when that happens? So the guests (all\nplaying themselves, by the way) do what they can to save themselves. Clearly, this film will only be good if the celebs\ninvolved are willing to completely take the piss out of themselves. If not, it\u2019s going to be absolutely horrific.\nAfter Earth\nRelease Date: June 7th\nDirector: M. Night Shyamalan\nCast: Will Smith, Jaden Smith,\nIsabelle Fuhrmann, Zoe Kravitz,\nDavid Denman\nStarring Will Smith and his son\nJayden as exotically named father\nand son duo Cypher and Kitai\nRaige, After Earth follows the pair\nas they attempt to transport humanity away from the dying planet Earth. However, things don\u2019t\ngo quite to plan, and their craft\ncrash lands on a planet that was\nabandoned a thousand years ago.\nSound like a reasonable premise,\nalthough M. Night Shyamalan\nwas responsible for he Last Airbender (possibly the worst film\never). Having said that, he was\nalso the writer of he Sixth Sense,\nso maybe he might be able to get\nto the top again with this latest\nattempt. At least the Smith team\nshould be good.\nOblivion\nRelease date: April 12th\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\nCast: Tom Cruise, Olga Kurylenko, Morgan Freeman, Andrea\nRiseborough, Melissa Leo, Zoe\nBell, Nicolaj Coster-Waldau\nOk, so this one\u2019s already in the\ncinemas, but it fits quite well in\nso we thought we\u2019d better include\nit. Based on the graphic novel (ap-parently we aren\u2019t allowed to call\nit a comic) of the same name written by director Kosinski, the tale\nfollows Jak Harper (Cruise) who\nlives his life on planet Earth that\nwas long since destroyed during a\nbattle with aliens. When he finds\nand rescues a 22-year-old traveller\nfrom a survival pod, he is forced\nto question all he knows about life\nand his mission. It\u2019s not a bad film,\nall things (*cough* Cruise) consid-ered. he visuals are great \u2013 the\nruined Earth contrasts brilliantly\nwith the scientific-looking pods\n\ufb02oating above it. he script has\nbeen much praised, and, although\nit wasn\u2019t a common sight at the recent awards ceremonies, Oblivion\nis certainly worth a watch.\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\nRelease Date: November 22nd\nDirector: Francis Lawrence\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks\nOk, so it\u2019s not really an apocalypse film \u2013 but it just about fits the bill. It is\nseveral centuries into the future in a new version of old America (now Panem) and, having returned home victorious from the 74th Annual Hunger\nGames after \ufb02outing the rules set by the twisted government of the Capitol,\nKatniss (Lawrence) and Peeta (Hutcherson) must now undertake the long\nVictors\u2019 Tour of all the down-trodden districts in the Capitol-controlled\ncountry. heir rebellion in the Hunger Games\u2019 arena didn\u2019t go unnoticed,\nhowever, and some of the Districts are stirring with rebellions of their own.\nWith Katniss fanning the \ufb02ame at every turn, the Capitol will stop at nothing to keep Panem under their exclusive control. With her knee still bleeding from her fall to pick up her Best Actress Oscar, Lawrence can only be\noutstanding. With a stellar cast backing her up (some of whom made their\nnames in the last film), this sequel is sure to be as big a hit as he Hunger\nGames was.\n\n"

    "content": "Bees feel the caffeine buzz\nPhilippa Skett sips a Starbucks whilst writing about how bees get their own daily fix\nA\nSCIENCE\nScience Editors: Philip Kent,\nLaurence Pope, Philippa Skett\nscience.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n16\ncommons.wikimedia.org\ndrink usually associated\nwith those that have\ntoo little time on their\nhands and too much\nto do, co\ufb00ee is not just\na beverage but has become a lifestyle\nchoice. What you drink is \u201cpersonal,\u201d\naccording to Starbucks, making this\nca\ufb00einated concoction sound more\nlike an out\ufb01t choice than a quick \ufb01x to\na lagging brain. However, it emerged\nthis week that it is not just humans\nthat indulge in the ca\ufb00eine kick \u2013 bees\nare feeling more than their usual buzz\ntoo.\nA study published by researchers\nthis week at Newcastle University have\nfound that honey bees - those that pollinate \ufb02owers whilst feeding on their\nnectar \u2013 regularly indulge in a ca\ufb00eine\n\ufb01x to increase their memory. Ca\ufb00eine,\na usually bitter molecule, is used by\nplants as a defence mechanism to discourage consumption by herbivores,\nbut is known at low levels to enhance\nmemory and cognitive performance.\nhis study suggests that ca\ufb00eine can\nalso have a pharmacological role by\nmanipulating the bee\u2019s behaviour, and\nensuring the bee keeps coming back to\nthe same plant to feed repeatedly.\nhe study measured the level of caffeine in the nectar of three species of\nplants, and saw that honeybees that\nfrequented those plants with higher\nlevels displayed a threefold increase\nin the likelihood of remembering the\nscent of the \ufb02ower. With this response,\nthe honeybees are therefore more likely to feed again on the same species\nof \ufb02ower, increasing the possibility of\nsuccessfully pollination and keeping\nthe circle of life turning.\nhe ca\ufb00eine induces both a weak effect on the rate of learning in the bees\nbut also a greater e\ufb00ect on long term\nmemory, with bees studied displaying\na memory span of up to three days after feeding on nectar enhanced by caf-feine. hese clever bees could remember the scent of the \ufb02ower they had\nfed from, increasing their likelihood\nof returning to the \ufb02ower in the fu-ture. hese bees would also associate\nthe \ufb02ower with reward, meaning they\nwould be more likely to feed again on\nits nectar and in turn become much\nmore faithful pollinators.\nNot only that, but these clever \ufb02owers have managed to get the balance\njust right \u2013 with ca\ufb00eine naturally a\nrepellent, concentrations found in\nthe plants tested were high enough to\ninduce a response in the honey bees\nbehaviour, but low enough to ensure\nthey were not put o\ufb00 by the bad taste\nand would stop feeding altogether.\nhis seems to be just one more of the\nmany goldilocks-type scenarios found\nin nature, tailored towards perfection\nby natural selection over the millions\nof years.\nhis research is crucial in the understanding of the foraging behaviour\nof bees \u2013 with population declines\nof these ecosystem busy-bodies will\ncome a pollination crisis that could\ndamage agriculture signi\ufb01cantly. Such\ndeclines are attributed to a number of\ncauses including the widespread use\nof insecticides. Global warming too\nmay be causing a change in the \ufb02owering patterns of plants, altering nectar\navailability. Furthermore, with the 50\nnative species of bees in the UK declining over the last 60 years to around\n25, invasive alien species may also be\ncontributing to a notable decline of\nour own bees, and the e\ufb00ect this may\nhave too on pollination of our crops\nlong-term is uncertain.\nFornowthough,nexttimeyouknock\nback that espresso, cast a thought to\nthe bees out there which are doing the\nsame. But remember too that these little guys are slowly in decline, so make\nsure you recycle that cup when you are\n\ufb01nished getting your early morning\nkick, so the bees may keep on buzzing\nlong after your own buzz \ufb01zzles out.\nDOI: 10.1126/science.1228806\nSCIENCE BITES\nChoccy and the dangers towards doggies\nEaster eggs are lining the shelves, but watch out\nChocolate is well known to be toxic to\ndogs \u2013 but why?\nCocoa, the basic ingredient of choco-late, contains a compound known as\ntheobromine (which doesn\u2019t actually\ncontain any bromine), a mild stimulant.\nIn general the darker the chocolate the\nhigher the theobromine concentration.\nUpon ingestion, theobromine is broken\ndown within the liver into various excreted metabolic products.

She\nalso called for antibiotic resistance to\nbe placed on the government\u2019s National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies, which currently covers such disasters as \ufb02ooding and terrorist attacks.\nDame Sally also claimed that pharmaceutical companies need to be\nencouraged to develop new antibiot-ics: right now there\u2019s no incentive for\npharmaceutical companies to develop\nthem: \u201cantibiotics will only be used for\na week or two when they\u2019re needed,\nand then they have a limited life span\nbecause of resistance developing anyway.\u201d\nNo new antibiotics have been introduced into the public domain since\n1987, whilst bacteria have been getting\non and developing resistance in the intervening 25 or so years.\nhe problem has stemmed primarily\nthrough antibiotic misuse. Improper\nuse of antibodies, such as not completing a full course or using them for viral\ninfections, destroys a large proportion\nof the bacterial population. he survivors are then left to replicate. Because\nthese survivors likely had a genetic\nadvantage over the deceased populace\nthis advantage is passed down, resulting in a bacterial population more\nlikely to resist the drug again.\nDespite the growing threat the\nmessage doesn\u2019t seem to be \ufb01ltering\nthrough properly. Similar pleas have\nbeen made by Dame Sally\u2019s predeces-sors, with warnings of the growing\nthreat spanning back to 1999.\nDame Sally\u2019s report can be read at\nhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/health/cat-egory/publications/reports-publi-cations/\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nArts Editors: Eva Rosenthal,\nMeredith Thomas\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH 21\nhe Barbican\u2019s art gallery is haunted by\nthe ghosts of avant-garde. Possessed\npianos play atonal compositions,\nwhile invisible dancers pitter-patter\nacross the halls, and long-dead voices\ncall out in French. his is the sound-scape against which the exhibition The\nBride and the Bachelors is set, forming the mise en sc\u00e8ne for a production\nwhich tells the story of a Dadaist giant\nand the New York scene he inspired.\nIn this tale, the \u2018Bride\u2019 is Marcel Duchamp, the radical French artist whose\n\u2018readymades\u2019 changed the art world\nforever. he \u2018Bachelors\u2019 courting him\nare the four titans of 1960s American avant-garde: Jasper Johns, Merce\nCunningham, John Cage, and Robert\nRauschenberg. he exhibition shows\nthe in\ufb02uence these artists had on one\nanother, and the enormous impact\nDuchamp\u2019s philosophy had on the arts\nas a whole\nDuchamp\u2019s magnum opus, The\nBride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors,\nEven (he Large Glass), forms the focal point of the exhibition; consisting\nof an ethereal, geometric \u2018bride\u2019 and\nher nine mechanical \u2018bachelors\u2019, sandwiched between two shattered panes\nof glass, the work is an exercise in\ndecay. Random encounters with dust,\ndirt and grime have been left in by\nDuchamp, making the piece a study\nin chance. First conceived of in 1913,\nthe piece was not completed until\n1923, and accompanying the piece are\nreams of notes, studies and paintings\ndepicting the various components of\nthe glass. Several of Duchamp\u2019s most\nfamous works, including Fountain and\nBicycle Wheel, are shown next to the\npiece, and serve as an introduction\ninto the artist\u2019s world.\nDuchamp was the central nucleus\nof a small group of New York art-ists, brought together through the\nMerce Cunningham Dance Company,\nthrough which they collaborated.\nMerce Cunningham was the chore-ographer, John Cage was the Music\nDirector, Robert Rauschenberg acted\nas the Resident Designer, and later\nJasper Johns became the company\u2019s\nArtistic Advisor. he show explores\nthis collaboration, and how the artists\nin\ufb02uenced one another\u2019s work. A large\nportion of the opening gallery is taken up by a stage, upon which dancers\nfrom the Merce Cunningham Dance\nStudio perform to a soundscape created by French artist and \ufb01lm-maker\nPhilippe Parreno; consisting of works\nby Cage, Duchamp, and Parreno him-self. his cycling of live and pre-re-corded sounds introduces an element\nof chance, allowing the exhibits to\nchange over time.\nChance was a key theme that\nbrought the artists together. Starting\nwith Duchamp\u2019s experiments in decay and motion, during which he let\nstrings drop through the air before\nphotographing how they landed, the\nexhibition then moves through Cage\u2019s\n\u2018chance operations\u2019, dictated by the I\nChing \u2013 a Chinese divination system.\nCage would allow the I Ching system\nto determine the structure of his mu-sic, resulting in unpredictable, atonal\ncompositions. Cunningham later used\nthe I Ching to determine where his\ndancers would move upon the stage,\nintroducing chance into a discipline\nthat had previously been based upon\ncontrol and coordination.\nWhile this system of composition\nmay seem revolutionary, the exhibition shows that Duchamp preceded\nthese by about 40 years with his Erratum Musical, in which syllables from\nthe French de\ufb01nition for imprimer\nwere randomly paired to notes pulled\nout of a hat, creating a completely random piece of music.\nhis Erratum Musical is a perfect\nexample of a Duchamp readymade \u2013 a\npiece in which Duchamp would take\nexisting, or found objects, and turn\nthem into art. he most famous ready-made piece is his Fountain, a urinal\nsigned R. Mutt which was considered\nthe starting point for Dadaism and\ncaused outrage when it was created in\n1917. he work is featured in the exhibition alongside Bicycle Wheel, an upturned wheel attached to a stool. hese\nreadymades formed the inspiration for\nthe sets Rauschenberg designed for\nCunningham, and in\ufb02uenced his own\nCombine paintings, made from a mixture of traditional media and found\nobjects.\nTaking this one step further,\nRauschenberg later began to create\nsculptures from solely readymade\nobjects; Music Box (Elemental Sculpture), created in 1953, consists of a\nnail studded box containing small peb-bles, the name referencing the sound\nmade when one shook the box. Johns\nalso took inspiration from the world\naround him; from his paintings of\nAmerican \ufb02ags, targets, and numerals,\nto his sculptures of cans and tins, John\n\u2013 just like Duchamp before him \u2013 elevates the everyday to the avant-garde.\nWhile John\u2019s work \ufb01ts into the\nthemes of the exhibition, it is markedly\ndi\ufb00erent from those around it; as a direct precursor of what would become\nto be known as Pop Art, his pieces are\nmore accessible \u2013 and more fun \u2013 than\nothers in the exhibition, which has a\nheavy focus on Cage\u2019s work. While\nit is completely possible to appreciate Cage\u2019s pieces on a theoretical or\nphilosophical level, they only really\ncome alive when they are performed.\nParreno\u2019s mise en sc\u00e8ne attempts to\nLady Dada\u2019s bad romance\nFred Fyles Writer\nbring the magical qualities in Cage\u2019s\npieces by playing them throughout\nthe exhibition, which would satisfy all\nbut his hard-core fans. Unfortunately,\nthe curators of the show decided to \ufb01ll\nup a large portion of the upper levels\nwith Cage\u2019s manuscripts.

    "content": "SPORT\n47\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\nSport Editors: Oli Benton,\nMargot Pikovsky, Sorcha Cotter\nsport.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nWoodhead had kicked the air so hard\nthat their striker had no choice but to\nfall over. he striker had clearly not\nrecovered from this near death experience and took the worst penalty Garner\nhad experienced all season: straight\ndown the middle with as much power\nas Superman holding Kryptonite. Garner was so surprised that he could only\npush the ball back out to the striker but\nhe got up quickly enough to thwart the\nrebound, keeping the clean sheet intact.\nJustice was invoked shortly after\nwhereby a delightful through ball from\nBeasley played in Bjorkstrand who\nchipped the onrushing keeper in Cantonaesque fashion, giving Imperial a\ndeserved 1-0 lead. he rest of the half\nwent by uneventfully, although a Bjorkstrand second was chalked o\ufb00 purely\nbecause the opposition linesman didn\u2019t\nwant Imperial to win.\nIt was clear that Imperial were on\ntop but the one goal scoreline was not\nenough. he second half again started\nwith Imperial taking control but a second goal could not be found. Jones and\nAbou Ela Bourquin hit the bar with\nheaders from Dale corners whilst Beasley was unlucky to have his strike well\nsaved by the keeper to deny him his\n\ufb01rst goal for Imperial since he was reincarnated as Smithy 2. Dale also had a\nchance to \ufb01nish o\ufb00 the game but his left\nfooted strike was, if anything, hit too\nwell (and too at the keeper). Hertfordshire pressed for a late equaliser with\na series of corners and a free kick that\nwas \ufb02icked on, but not well enough to\nprevent Garner making a comfortable\ndiving save.\nhe full time whistle was greeted\nwith hugging and general laddish behaviour from ICUAFC and the realisation was that a single point from either\nof the two remaining games would be\nenough to guarantee promotion.\nWith BUCS promotion almost guar-anteed, attentions turned to cup; the\none occasion where a muggle sport is\nmore magical than quidditch. Having\nbeaten GKT 1s in the quarter-\ufb01nals, a\nsemi-\ufb01nal against their 2s should have\nbeen, on paper, an easier proposition.\nhis notion was dispelled in 120 minutes of nerves and tension.\nHaving got over the initial shock of\nnot having an AUX cable in the mini-bus, members of the team refocused\ntheir attention on the job in hand. A 16\nman strong squad provided depth and\nexperience that should have been able\nto grind out a result regardless.\nhe match started slowly although\nImperial edged the opening encoun-ters. he hard work being put in came\nto fruition about 25 minutes into the\ngame where a vintage Bjorkstrand\nthrough ball found Robinson in an acre\nof space and he calmly sent the keeper\nthe wrong way with a casual \ufb01nish. At\nthis point you could have been forgiven for thinking that Imperial were\n\ufb01nal bound but a host of chances were\nnot converted meaning that the lead at\nhalf-time was a slender 1-0.\nAgain a second goal did not come, although an ambitious 35 yard piledriver\nby Hill was tipped round the post by\nthe keeper at the start of the second\nhalf. When a win looked imminent,\nImperial paid for their inadequacies in\nImperial has gone from strength to\nstrength this year, currently holding\nthe top position in the BUCS South\nEastern 2A division and only having\ndropped one game this season. Despite\nwinning recent games by impressive\nmargins, Imperial approached their\n\ufb01nal LUSL \ufb01xture of the year against\nthe strong and talented UCL with a\ncertain degree of trepidation, knowing\nit would be the true test of how far they\nhave come. In recent years UCL have\nardently beaten Imperial, a point highlighted by their status two BUCS divisions above us, and this certainly made\nit a \ufb01xture we were looking forward to.\nStepping onto the pitch for the\nwarm up, it became apparent that the\nweather was not going to be on our\nside. Freezing temperatures and intermittent sleet showers would prove to\nmake catching and passing a challenge\nbut the drive to beat our toughest rivals\nmade us warm enough to step up and\nbegin the match nonetheless. tFrom\nthe kick-o\ufb00 Imperial drove ahead with\n\ufb01erce determination, attacking UCL\u2019s\ndefensive line again and again with our\nforwards. Eventually, scrum-half Kath\nFok took her chance through a break\nin the line and was rewarded with a try\nout wide which did much to encourage\nthe team but made for a di\ufb03cult conversion attempt for hooker Lana Lee.\nWith 5 points clocked, Imperial\nfaced up to the reset with even greater determination and again pushed\nhard at UCL\u2019s defence. Several penalties from the rucks gave Imperial the\nchance to \ufb02ex their scrum, which held\nits own and more against the UCL\npack. Solid rucking from UCL provided them with a turnover, which was\nquickly passed down their hands out\nto the wing where some impressive\noutrunning of our defence translated\ninto a try out wide. At 5-5, Imperial\nremained calm and kicked o\ufb00 with a\nbig chase into their 22. When a knock-on from UCL came, Imperial capitalised from their impressive scrum with\ncaptain Yasmin Edwards breaking past\nseveral defenders to o\ufb04oad to Lucy\nOlli\ufb00 for our second try of the match.\nhis time, the score came between the\nposts and Lana nailed the conversion\nwhich would later prove to be crucial.\nUCL responded quickly with another\nbreak on the wing slicing through Imperial\u2019s line to equalise the try count.\nLeading 12-10 at half-time, Imperial were anything but cocky about\nthe outcome and so pushed hard for\nfurther scores in the second half. In\nthis half Imperial remained dominant,\ntaking the majority of the territory and\npushing again and again at the UCL\ndefence. Unfortunately, by this point\nthe cold had worsened causing a \ufb02urry\nof knock-ons from both sides. he resulting scrums worked the forwards\nhard but impressive hooking from\nLana saw us retain our put-ins, as well\nas several steals which gave us more\nchances to push for tries. However,\nUCL appeared rejuvenated by the arrival of their captain and their proper\nkit, and formed an almost impenetrable wall. Imperial changed tactics, opting for mauls to drive UCL back over\ntheir score line but the mass of bodies\nmeant that our break through the line\nwas held up and we were unable to extend our lead.\nFrantic play in the last 10 minutes\nsaw UCL possession forcing us back\ninto our own 22. Slow formation of\nour defensive line almost provided\nUCL with too many gaps to run\nthrough, but Imperial\u2019s determination to hold out at 12-10 manifested\nin a strong scramble defence that held\neven when the ball came loose, with\nfull back Wakana Teranka putting the\nball over our own line to temporarily keep UCL at bay with a 5m scrum.\nTime and time again the Imperial line\nheld, with notable cover tackles from\nYas, until an interception gave us the\nturnover just as the whistle blew for\nfull time. he initial reaction was one\nof disbelief (certain members didn\u2019t\neven know we were ahead!), soon followed by hysterical joy, exhaustion\nand then near hypothermia from the\ncold, but it had all been worth it for\nour best win of the season. Congratulations speci\ufb01cally to Forwards of the\nMatch, Charlie Stephens and Heather\nGrant, who were both instrumental in\nrucks, tackles and breakthroughs, and\nBack of the Match Lucy Olli\ufb00 who was\nalways there in support and provided\nexcellent defensive tackles. However,\nthe whole team should be commended\nfor their commitment, with this match\ndemonstrating how much Imperial has\nimproved \u2013 bring on next season!\nIC Women\u2019s Rugby topple UCL\nFootball 1s continue dominance\nSportsWriter\nCharlotte Hewitt\nfront of goal as a corner evaded all the\ndefenders and found their striker. A delightful left footed swivel shot nestles in\nthe far side netting, drawing the score\nback to 1-1. Tempers \ufb02ared with Murphy questioning the impartiality of the\nGKT linesman and Robinson taking\nan opportunity to remind the referee\nexactly what he thought of him. With\ntime running out neither team could\nget a winner, taking Imperial to extra-time for the third occasion this season.\nTK MAXX 2s could have been forgiven for thinking 11 new players had\ncome out for Imperial in extra-time as\nImperial dominated and quickly found\nthemselves in front again. Dale burst\ndown the wing with pace that J.W.M\nTurner himself would have struggled\nto capture on canvas. he resulting\ncross was sheer perfection, an artistic\nblend of Caravaggio, Rafael and Titian infused with some Pollock \ufb02air,\n\ufb01nding the diving head of Robinson\nand ultimately the back of the net. he\ngame was over as a contest shortly into\nthe second half of extra-time as a disguised Murphy pass found Jones who\nshimmied around a number of tackles\nbefore planting a \ufb01nesse shot into the\nback of the net.\nImperial were able to shut up shop for\nthe remaining minutes and have now\nreached the LUSL (formerly ULU) \ufb01nal\nfor the 4th year in a row, where they\nwill meet LSE 1s. he next few weeks\nare pivotal and could potentially see an\nunprecedented domestic double. Mention should also go to ICUAFC 3s, 5s\nand 6s who have each been promoted\nfrom one of their leagues, whilst the\nlatter have reached their own cup \ufb01nal.\nBoth cup \ufb01nals takes place on Saturday\n16th March which is, rather \ufb01ttingly,\nexactly 1,976 years to the day that Caligula became Roman Emperor.\ncontinued from the back page\n>>\n\n"

Marvels of\nmodern technology, something underlined by the much quoted: \u201cyour smartphone has the equivalent\nprocessing power of the\ncomputers used for the\nApollo space missions\u201d,\nthey have revolutionised\nthe way we interact with\nother human beings as\nwell as giving us tools to\naccomplish a multitude of\ntasks. In a sense these increasingly powerful devices have\nfreed us from a desk-bound\nenvironment, as they can ful\ufb01l many tasks that your average desktop would do. All in all\nit seems smartphones enrich our\ndaily lives.\nNow to the absolutely\nclich\u00e9 question: or have\nthey? Recent data suggests that smartphones may not\nreally be the boon society has hoped for.\nA rising trend of\nsmartphone addiction in teens\nin various \ufb01rstworld countries\nhas led some experts\nto worry. More than\n60 per cent of teens in the\nUK say they are addicted to\ntheir smartphone, and those are\njust the ones willing to admit to it.\nYou might argue that smartphones increase e\ufb03ciency, and I couldn\u2019t argue\nagainst this, as they allow us to utilise\nthe time where we are away from the\ndesktop/laptop. Although they can also\nhelp us have fun while at our desks, if\ninstead of studying for your exams, you\nplay with constant vibration apps.\nI myself have experienced a somewhat\nstrange consequence of this addiction\nin Imperial. While sitting in my lecture,\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n40\nsomewhat disillusioned by the dry\nlecture topic, I decided to take a look\naround at my fellow students to entertain myself. What I discovered surprised me somewhat. Of the 20 people\nin my immediate vicinity, about 16 of\nthem had their smartphones either on\ntheir desks, laps or in their hands.\nSeriously people, what is the\npoint of going to your lecture\nif all you\nare\ngoing to do is stare at your smartphone 90 per cent of the time? Are\nyou really paying Imperial\u2019s fees to sit\nin a lecture theatre and answer Facebook messages?\nUsing your smartphone on the toi-let, sleeping with your smartphone,\nchecking your smartphone on more\nthan an hourly basis and getting a\npanic attack (also known as nomo-phobia: no mobile phobia) if you are\nwithout your smartphone could all be\nsymptoms of smartphone addiction. If\nyou exhibit all of these symptoms, but\nremain unsure if you are addicted, try\nthis little thought experiment: imagine a whole day where instead of your\nsmartphone you have a feature phone\n(i.e. you can text and call, what phones\nAddicted Smartphone Syndrome\nAre you a victim of the global smartphone dictatorship?\nThe News Bubble\nGeneral news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the\nnewest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.\nLiking Facebook likes\nScientists have recently developed an algorithm that uses Facebook likes to accurately predict different personality traits. The algorithm can predict ethnic-ity, sexual orientation, political preference and religion with a success rate of\nat least 80%. That however is not the least of it, as using the data that your Facebook likes provide this algorithm can make strange connections that would\nnormally seem totally unrelated. For examples, if you like curly fries you are\nmore likely to be highly intelligent, while a Harley Davidson fetish implies a\nlower IQ. Also, if you are a girl and liked Hello Kitty, this, strangely enough,\nsuggests that you are emotionally unstable. Thinking about it though, this may\nnot actually be that strange.\nChromebook Immune\nAt Google\u2019s Pwnium, hackers fail to crack Google\u2019s Chrome OS, leaving a\n\u00a32.1 million prize unclaimed. While the OS has little to really offer, as it is a\nweb-based operating system, this added security (which was not achieved by\nanyone else) might appeal to businesses or government agencies that rely on\nkeeping secrets.\nMicrosoft Kinect now open\nThe main code behind the Kinect, which allows it to recognize faces, movements and colours has finally been revealed to the general public. Previously\nMicrosoft released a software package, which allowed for some limited\ncustomisation of the Kinect for coders. However, this did not really allow for\nthe true potential of the Kinect to be realised. Now with the code behind it\nto be utilised, we may see some pretty awesome things.\nAnd now here something random for you to see:\n60 percent of\nteens in the\nUK call themselves an addict of their\nsmartphone,\nTech editor\nMaximilian Eggl Tech Editor\nwere originally used for). Could\nyou manage the whole 24 hours?\nIf these thoughts alone make you\nstart shivering and breaking out\nin sweat, don\u2019t fret dear reader,\nfor this esteemed writer himself su\ufb00ers from the same\ncondition. So what to do now?\nWell, as with any addiction,\nthe key is to admit to yourself\nthat you have it. Only\nthen can you actually commence\nalong the path\nto recovery.\nStart weaning yourself\no\ufb00 your\nphone; do\nnot look\nat it every\ns i n g l e\ng o d d a m\nhour, and\nset yourself a time\nlimit for\nnot using\nit. In fact\nI \ufb01nd lectures to be\nthe perfect time interval for this, and\nit adds the bene\ufb01t of enhancing my\nproductivity.\nNow I am not saying that smartphone addition is a serious problem,\nbut when people have to introduce\nrules to ban smartphones from dinner dates, then something really has\nto be done, before all social interaction is replaced by a 4\u2019\u2019 to 5\u2019\u2019 screen.\nIn fact the quote: \u201cLife is what happens around you, while you are\nstarting at your smartphone screen\u201d\nperfectly describes what\u2019s going on.\nPeople are so scared that they are\ngoing to miss out on Facebook noti\ufb01cations, emails and texts, that in\nfact they miss out on what is happening in the real world.\n\u201c\nLife is what\nhappens\naround you,\nwhile you are\nstarting at\nyour smartphone screen\nscribo ad nuntius, ergo sum\nWRITE FOR US!\nPlease.\nEmail: felix@imperial.ac.uk\n\n"

Have I been precise\nenough with my request (\u201ca small\nsoya flat white with two shots\u201d per-haps, or \u201ca medium-blend filter with\nwarm full-fat milk on the side\u201d) or,\nconversely, have I been so precise\nthat the barista might, reasonably,\nhock in the milk? I scrutinise the\nhapless Spaniard/PhD student/fu-ture Oscar winner across the coun-ter, and try desperately to read the\n(strictly metaphorical) tea leaves.\nThe personality profiling gives way\nto other concerns as I tend to the\nplight of the milk: has it been taken\ncold from the fridge or (horrors!) is\na tepid pitcher being reheated? How\nhigh has it been filled and how low\nhas the steaming arm being thrust?\nIs a thermometer being used, and if\nnot, how attentively is the heat being monitored? The cruelty of an ill-attended jug! I empathise with that\nscalded milk like it\u2019s a fourteenth\ncentury heretic at the stake.\nBy the time the milk is ready to be\nCappuccino: one third each of es-presso, steamed milk and froth, usually sprinkled with chocolate.\nEtymology \u2013 derived from the name of\nthe red-brown habits of the Capuchin\nfriars.\nortunately my predicament is shared by many the\nworld over. Co\ufb00ee is now\nthe second most-traded\ncommodity in the world\n(after crude oil) and 70 million cups\nare drunk in the UK every day. 57%\nof us now regularly drink in co\ufb00ee\nshops, and trade, particularly amongst\nindependents, is booming despite the\nrecession. Books, blogs, articles and\nadvice abound about where to \ufb01nd the\nbest brew, and co\ufb00ee is fast catching\nup with wine in terms of the snobbery\nof its a\ufb01cionados.\nIn fact, co\ufb00ee and wine share much\nin common, and it seems no coincidence that the root of the English\nword \u2018co\ufb00ee\u2019 comes from an Arabic\nterm, qahhwat al-bun, meaning \u2018wine\nof the bean\u2019. Like oenophiles, ca\ufb00eine\nheads would claim that their beverage\nis an entire sensory experience: the\nwarmth of the cup between the hands;\nthe artistry in the collapsing hearts on\nthe cap of the foam, the smell of the\ngrind and its silky smoothness on the\ntongue, coupled with the rich kick of\nthe co\ufb00ee itself. Not to mention the\nconversations. I am convinced I have\nthe best conversations when nursing a\ncup of co\ufb00ee.\nAnd like the vine, the bean has quite\nsome background. he origins of the\ndrink itself lie in Ethiopia \u2013 with mys-tics, goatherds or saints, depending on\nwhich version you believe \u2013 roughly\naround the turn of the thirteenth cen-tury. It was not until the middle of the\n\ufb01fteenth century that co\ufb00ee drinking\nbecame a more regular practice, and\nthe \ufb01rst co\ufb00ee house would not open\nin Britain for another two hundred\nyears.\nBut at this point, co\ufb00ee got clout.\nBy the turn of the century some 3,000\nco\ufb00ee houses could be found in London alone, where they became the hub\nof the energised debates on religion\nand politics that characterised the Enlightenment.

Distressingly often confused with \ufb01lter co\ufb00ee, but the preparation of an espresso extracts more \ufb02avour from a bean than does \ufb01ltering; the\n\ufb02ipside of this is the potential for acidity.\nEtymology \u2013 a word developed in World\nWar II to describe the drink made by\nAmerican troops, who added hot water\nto their espressos.\nFilter: brewed co\ufb00ee (ideally single\norigin) \ufb01ltered by gravity rather than\nforce, often described by strength (e.g.\nmild, very strong), and even more often demeaned by baristas who leaving\nit sweating for hour upon hour.\nEtymology \u2013 you are clearly under-caf-feinated.

    "content": "MUSIC\nMusic Editors: Mark England,\nRoss Gray, Simon Hunter\nmusic.felix@gmail.com\nFRIDAY 15 MARCH\n26\nlike to think my taste in music has greatly varied over the\nyears. I have gone through the\nteenage phase of listening to\nGreen Day, Sex Pistols, Fall\nout Boy, Panic! At the Disco etc.\nYou get the gist of it all. here was\nalso a time when I used to listen to\nhard rock in the form of System of a\nDown, Bullet for My Valentine and\nSlipknot amongst others. hese days,\nI have moved onto a lot more indie\npop, post-punk and dream pop. he\nreason I am telling you this is because\nHalestorm doesn\u2019t fall in any of those\ncategories. Halestorm is in essence a\nhard rock band which I came across\nwhen they supported Slash last year\nat the Hammersmith Apollo. hat was\na curious gig to say the least, since the\nsupporting act, a Dutch new wave/\nelectronic/art punk band called Minny Pops, was booed o\ufb00 stage. It wasn\u2019t\nall disappointment before Slash\u2019s appearance because that\u2019s the moment\nHalestormbringsdownthehouseinCamden\nPlabon Saha reports back from the Electric Ballroom\nthat Halestorm came on. heir energy\non stage was simply admirable and\nat this point I think drummer Arejay\nHale should get a special mention for\nhis acrobatic e\ufb00orts of constantly juggling drumsticks in the middle of a\nsong. Lzzy Hale\u2019s strong vocals meant\nit was the perfect start to a rock gig\nand at that point I became a fan (and\nwent home to download their music\nillegally, like all the cool kids do {fyi I\nam not a total prick, I tend to pay for\ngigs rather than buy records}).\nSo remembering that day, it was\nwith great anticipation that I went to\nsee Halestorm perform at the Electric\nBallroom in Camden on Friday the\n8th of March. I actually missed the\nsupport act but I didn\u2019t really need\nto be warmed up (listening to music\nduring the tube ride would normally\nsu\ufb03ce, oh and alcohol helps). Before\nI dissect their setlist, I should also say\nhow good Electric Ballroom is as a\nvenue. It\u2019s the sort of place that\u2019s not\nI\ntoo small so that you feel everything\nyou do is watched neither it is too big\nwhere it makes you feel insigni\ufb01cant.\nIt is just the right size that makes you\nfeel intimate with the band. Halestorm\nopened with \u2018Freak Like Me\u2019 and \u2018Love\nBites (So Do I)\u2019 from their sophomore\nalbum and the upbeat vocals and\ndrumming was quick to get the audience jumping. After a couple of other\nsongs, came a Dio cover in the form\nof \u2018Straight hrough the Heart\u2019, which\nwas done exceptionally well, I must\nadd. Here was a band that knew their\naudience well and knew the importance of the classics and appreciated\nthe rock enigma that is Ronnie James\nDio. here was also another instance\nlater in the set when they played a\nGuns N\u2019Roses cover of \u2018Out Ta Get\nMe\u2019. But before that, Lzzy Hale demonstrated the range of her vocal and\nmusical ability as she played \u2018Break In\u2019\non the piano. It had a hint of Evanescence in it but in my opinion Lzzy has\nalready eclipsed Amy Lee in terms of\nability and vocal range.\nhere was something for the seasoned admirers too, with songs such\nas \u2018Innocence\u2019. I should also mention\nthe heroics of Arejay, the drummer\nhere who decided to perform a quick\nsolo. he man is simply mental with\na pair of drumsticks when he\nhas a kit in front\nof him. He knows\nhow to keep a\nbeat going even\nwith one hand.\nhis was the \ufb01rst\ntime I have seen\nhim do a drum\nsolo and I think\nhe was enjoying\nit as much as the\naudience as he\nthrew his drumsticks to the audience and decided\nto bring out a pair\nof giant sticks and\nkeep going before deciding even that\u2019s\nnot enough as he resorted to drumming with his hands. All in all, it was\nan admirable and enthusiastic performance from him. he show closed\nvery well with the band\u2019s upbeat single\n\u2018I Get O\ufb00\u2019. I particularly loved the way\nthe encore started with \u2018Here\u2019s to Us\u2019\nbefore moving onto \ufb01nishing o\ufb00 with\na high tempo song \u2018I Miss the Misery\u2019.\nAnd with that, o\ufb00 went my mate and\nI to the pub for a couple more cheeky\npints before we decided to call it a\nnight.\nAs someone who has recently\nmoved away from listening to a lot of\nhard rock, I would have to say I might\nhave to re-consider a return to the\ngenre after that performance. After\nthe success the band has had after the\nrelease of he Strange Case Of\u2026, I can\nonly hope that they would continue in\nthat upward trajectory and become\na genre de\ufb01ning band with their 3rd\nalbum. It doesn\u2019t matter when they release it, as long as it\u2019s composed well, I\ncan see great things happening for the\ngroup.\nMark England Music Editor\nHurts are a duo from Manchester\nwho I was undecided about; were they\nsome bizarrely intelligent synth pop\nsaviours (their debut sold over a million copies worldwide), or were they,\nin fact, an industry joke: two blokes\nwith very good connections, who possibly have shares in Moss Bros, and\na good eye for publicity stunts. So\nwhen a copy of their new album, Exile,\ndropped on my desk, I was intrigued\nto \ufb01nd out if it could shed any more\nlight.\nIf you look at the album cover, and\nlisten to the \ufb01rst few tracks it is clear\nthat Hurts have only really one setting\n\u2013 \u201cepic\u201d. Every moment tries to out-epic the last, with phrases like \u201cmiracle\u201d, \u201cheart of gold\u201d and \u201cwatch as\nthe world burns\u201d bandied around so\nmuch it comes at you like U2 sound-tracking that moment in the Lion King\nwhere Simba gets raised in the air on\nthat big rock. Let\u2019s just say that understated is not a word Hurts have heard\nof.\nI am not saying that this is a bad\nAMS album of the week\nThe Flaming Lips have come a long way\nsince their debut album. Hear It Is, released\nin 1986 (not even kidding), was a grungey,\nnoisey garage punk affair that few will even\nrecognise as the psychedelic pop band who\nwould cause such a stir in later years. From\n1995-2002 the Flaming Lips released the\nholy trinity of neo-psychedelia with the\ncompletely nuts Clouds Taste Metallic, the\nbeautiful The Soft Bulletin and the commeri-cal behemoth Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Since then they\u2019ve been a little\nless consistent. 2006\u2019s At War With the Mystics took Yoshimi\u2019s commercialised\ndirection with little of the sincerity whilst 2009\u2019s Embryonic returned them\nto their experimental roots with mixed results. In and around that we\u2019ve had\na Pink Floyd cover album, a collaboration album featuring Ke$ha and Chris\nMartin and a 24 hour song you could buy encased in a real human skull (not\neven kidding). This is their first proper album since 2009, so where have Wayne\net al. decided to take us this time?\nThe answer is disappointment central. I feel like I came to this with reasonable\nexpectations. I wasn\u2019t expecting another Soft Bulletin or Yoshimi. I had already\ncome to terms with the fact they would never scale such peaks again. I have assessed their stuff since then on in its own merits and been impressed every time.\nThe problem with The Terror is that for the first time in 27 years the Flaming Lips\nhave done something boring. You can say what you want about releasing a 24\nhour song you could buy encased in a real human skull, but at least you have\nsomething to say about it. There\u2019s just not really anything here worth discuss-ing. It reminds me a lot of the afore mentioned Hear It Is. The first track is fantastic and then it tails off. It\u2019s a band who obviously have something but this is only\na glimpse of what they\u2019re capable of. The problem is that they are obviously on\nthe other side of the peak now. On Hear It Is you can attribute it to a band finding its feet, hear it is (see what I did there?) a band losing them. Hopefully I\u2019ll\nbe proved wrong, and they\u2019ll recover. For now though, a dark cloud hovers over\nme: I am not excited about the next Flaming Lips material.\nThe Flaming Lips: TheTerror\nStuart Masson\nSoepicitHurts\nthing; anthems have their place\nin today\u2019s musical landscape.\n\u2018Sandman\u2019 is a track which\nworks well with hints of Krautrock as well as a bit of R&B.\nLead single \u2018Miracle\u2019 is probably the standout moment with\nmore vigour than a whole pack\nof Alka-Seltzer. Among the few\nhits, however, are many more\nmisses which come o\ufb00 on the\nwrong side of tired Euro-pop.\nhis album provides ample evidence why Hurts enjoy massive\nsupport in continental Europe, but are\nperhaps less well received over here.\nSix or seven songs into the album\nand the over the top nature of the album starts to grate and you start wishing that Hurts lived in a less grandiose\nand emotive bubble. I started to wish\nthat they had been a bit more Berlin\nand a bit less Bulgaria because there\nare moments when the electro-shtick\nworks. And then something strange\nhappens, \u2018he Crow\u2019 comes on, bringing with a feeling that the album is\nsorely lacking \u2013 it doesn\u2019t try too hard.\nTrue, it is the token slow ballad near\nthe end, but at least it gives me time\nto take a breather from the epic rollercoaster that as so far made me feel a\nbit nauseous. I start to believe the lyrics more when they are not constantly\nbacked by soaring synths and rammed\ninto anthemic choruses.\nSo this album has not really solved\nthe issue I had with Hurts, continuing in a similar vein to their debut. Do\nthey really believe in the drama they\nare peddling? I am not convinced but I\ncan congratulate them on actually getting this far because when they arrived\nI was sure that they would be a one-album-wonder type band. So kudos.\n\n"
