    "content": "FELIX\nFACES IN FOCUS\nLIBEL UNLIMITED\nby I.L. Gibsor\nWith the presentation of Kenneth McMillan's new ballet, \"The Invitation\", at\nCovent Garden earlier this year, sex invaded the realm of the ballet. This hour-long piece in five scenes, set to\nthe music of the late Matyas Soiber,\ntells the story of the sex education\nand rape of a young woman and\nthe inevitable effects of this on her\nrelationship with her boyfriend. We see\nthe transition from the young and fresh\ninnocence of the boy and girl, recent lv emerged from the school room, to the\nsaddened and disillusioned young lady\nwho, with her new knowledge and experience, automatically shrinks from her boyfriend when they meet again in the closing scene of the ballet.\nTt can be seen, therefore, that instead\nof the more usual \"fairy tale\" story for a ballet we have a fragment from real life;\nalthough the setting is Edwardian, the\nballet is essentially straight from the\n1960s and is a strangely moving and forceful addition to the Covent Garden repertory. Two furthur performances are scheduled for February 10th and March 17th. Frederick Ashton's latest work, \"Les\nDeux Pigeons\" will receive its first performance at a Gala night on Februarv\n14th, while Ashton's most successful work\nfrom last season, \"La Fille Mai Gardee\"\nwill be revived on March 8th. This is perhaps the most delightful and\ncharming new ballet we have seen in London for some years. The story of the\nwidower is simplicity itself and combined\nwith some lovely decor by Osbert Lancaster, and a light and carefree so ore by\nyoung farmer for the daughter of a rich\nnineteenth century composer Herold,\nthe total effect is one of gaiety and charm.\nThe title roles wil, as last year ,be danced\nby David Blair and Nadia Nerina perhaps technically the finest Ballerina at\nOovent Garden at the present time.\nHI from SI\nSurprisingly the carnival organisation\nis still proceeding in approximately the\nright direction even though it is burdened\nwith the necessity of doing something.\nThe carnival week events starting Mon.\nday.

D.H. do not refer to are fe o tory but\nto our refectory President.\nIan is one of those rare characters\nwho believes that England begins at\nCroydon, in other words a Londoner.\nOften to be seen in the bar, one might\nthink that the phrase \"convivial intel-lect u al\" describes him to a tee. Accurate\nanalysis, however, will indicate a certain\nelement of doubt.\nIn the first year, he grew a beard,\nand, as a result, he joined the Phoenix\nstaff.. This was the first Prelim, year and\ncontained many other notables, such r.s N,B. Greaves, whose parents must have\nhad a sense of humour, D.J. Irving, about\nwhom we still say nothing, and others.\nAh! those palmy days of yore, when\none could pick up Phoenix and read \"Mr.\nHill's Social Page\". It is not everything,\nT fear, that has o hanged for the better.\nLiving up to his principle of anything\nfor a laugh, he decided to d jo Chem.\nEng., and to take part in Union act iv it ies. Rising fast in the social world, he\nwas e leo ted chairman of the Chem. Eng.\nSociety and Chairman of Entertainments.\nIn this dual role he had many triumphs,\nnot the least of which was an incredible\nChem. Eng. dinner, which even today is\nspoken of as a remarkable example of\nwhat one man can do when he really\ntries.\nIt soon became apparent that the star\nof deBt c ny was to alight on him, and\nhe assumed the purple with a grace and\ncharm wh i oh utterly vanquished his bit-terre et opponents. IWith a dignity altogether regal, he o an win the hearts of\nall sorts of unlikely people, as can be\nseen from the fact that he has talked\nJIM CARTER\nby Ian Hill\nJim Carter was born in Blackburn before the Second World War, in which\nevent he played but a small part. After\na fascinating ^education at St. Mary's School, Jim arrived at City & Guilds in\nOctober 1955. Like many infamous men\nbefore him Jim took four years to graduate in his chosen subject \u2014 Aero. Engineering, and is now, by some peculiar\nquirk of a chance doing \"valuable\" research work m the same department.\nWith a voice like his it was no surprise\nthat Jim be o a me involved in Union act-iv i ties. Doing sterling work in goal for\nthe I.C. Hockey XI and not quite so\nsterling work for the U.L. U. Bridge\nClub led to Jim be oo ming Vice President\nof Guilds last year, a year during which\nhis voice was used to advantage (?) on\nI.C. Counoil.\nThis year Jim's activities are as varied\nas ever, apart from being Hon. Sec. of\nT.C. Union he is Captain ,of a highly\nunskilled and highly unfit Rugger team\nof which he is most highly unskilled and\nhighly unfit member.\n\u2014 Long Live Jim \u2014\nEDITOR'S FOOTENOTE:\nJim was recently heard to say: \"I'm not sex mad, just healthy.\"\nhis wav into doing aP.G. course in Concrete Technology.\nFinally, we believe that there is no\ntruth in the rumour that he is to become\nengaged. When questioned about this, he\nsaid, \"We are just good friends.\"\nJO.\nPersonal Opinion\nDear Sir,\nI am more than glad to provide the\ncomment requested by Mr. Jeffrey Turner.\nI agreed with him for three years j nd only recently have I had second thoughts\non this matter.\nThe lack of ULU-mindedness among\nI.C. students has two aspects. The mere\nfailure to use the facilities of ULU is\neasily explained. It is Bimply a matter of\ngeography. Is it reasonable to expect\nstudents to go as for as Bloomsbury when\nthere facilities almost as good here in\nSouth Kensington? Several do so, I know,\nbut the majority do not, and I do not\nblame them.\nThe failure to join in ULU activities\nmay appear more serious, but I no longer\nth;\nnk it is. It certainly does ULU no\nharm. For example, last year's ULU carnival realised a record sum without our\nhelp. Indeed, had we put as mu oh effort\ninto the ULU carnival as we did into\nour own, the result in terms of cash would\nprobably have been less than we raised\nourselves. It is simply a case of the Law\nof Diminishing Returns. ULU is quite big\nenough without us, and we, for that\nmat j ter, are big j enough without ULU.\nRemember I.C. itself is as large as some\nuniversities.\nTo those who argue that more ULUmindedness would help to make I.C. less\nof a \"glorified poly te oh nio\" I would point\nout that we can do far more in this direction by putting our own house in order\nas Mr. Cox suggests.\n\"Imperialist\"\nDear Sir,\nThe following are from a report issued\nby the British Association, led by Sir\nPatrick Linstead, Reotor of the College.\n\"Universities should cut down unnecessary memo rising of scientific fa ots which\ncan be looked up in reference books.'?\n\"Many of Britain's most able scientists\nare now so specialised that they cannot\nbe classed as educated.\"\n\"Universities will turn out young\nscientists more and more ignorant outside\ntheir specialised subjects unless their curriculum in schools and college is widened.'*\nI feel that we, as students, are being\nsubjected, not only here, but recently in\nthe whole of the national press, to the\nplatitudes of people who ought to know\nbetter. Science, at its most conservative,\nis more concerned with assimilating knowledge than with original thought. At its\nmost liberal, it is concerned with the application of known facts to new situations.\nIn either case, a oom pre hen sive. basic\nknowledge is required. This, sir, cannot\nbe obtained by reading Shakespeare and\nlistening to Beethoven, and I have no\ndesire to spend an extra v ear at college\nto enable artistic appreciation to be included in the curriculum. The only way\nto turn out more cultured scientists is to\nten ch them less science. Is this too his rha price to pay? Is your own house in\norder, Sir Patrick?\nYours faithfully,\nC.E. Arnev\nWINTER BATHING.\nby an R.C.S. Trophy Officer\nThursday 26th January\nUpon this day the ducks of the Round\nPond witnessed an unusual sight. About\nsix tv undergraduates were escorting one\nhardy individual towards the water's murky depths. For one moment this man's sacrifice seemed not to be forthcoming,\nfor three uniformed individuals were seen\napproaching the festive crowd at an alarming rate. For a moment the swimmer stood\npoised on the brink, then plunged, aided\nby many brawny arms. He sunk into the\ncrystal clear depths of the frozen fresh\nwater, then surfaced, breaking the crisp\ncrystals of ice that were freshly formed\non the surface.\nA top hatted individual in tails, together\nwith a bonnet ed beard less ruffian then approached the pond, laughed, and the lead\nthe crowd in a furious war chant .The\nswimmer crawled up onto the bank finding the crowd pacified, for retribution had\nbeen met. The constitution had demanded\nthat one man should be sacrificed, and\none had been sacrificed, purified in the\nicy depths of the Round Pond.\nLaughing and chattering gaily the\nnow peaceful mob made their way back\nto the Union, leaving behind them a bed-rag g led, cold, wet, but peaceful man. He\nwas content, yea. for justice had been\ndealt and justice itself was met.\nP.S. Reported missing. One long thin\nstick with a ball on the end. Painted\nback, white and purple. Anyone who has\nany knowledge of the whereabouts of this\nobject is requested to notify the nearest\nR.C.S. Union officials.\nSERIOUS SIDE\nBagging and childish behaviour in\nplenty. That was all part of letting off\nsteam b v the few B.C.8. men at the last\nUnion Meeting.\nThose out for maturity by more serious\ndealings took up the business of looking\ninto the B.C.S. Constitution and the behaviour of the Union Officers, a ii es^ nin\"\nthe functioning of our dictatorial Committees and loos ly worded constitution.\nThe discussion reached a climax when Mr.\nMcpherson's request for noon v of Hip\nconstitution to be sent to C VTV m Amt wr of the Union, and its complete review by\nth^ Executive, was meekly accepted by\nthe President.\nSoon every member of R.C.S. will get\na copy of the Constitution and be asked\nto read and comment on it. If they all\ndid this and picked out its numerous flaws\nthe thousand-and-some criticisms which\ncame in would be enough to shake a mountain, and enough to knock the\nR.C.S. Union and its Officers off their\nfeet.\nLet us try; it will show where we\nstand, what the Union can do for us, and\nhow strong it is.\nADVERTISING\nA Tonic OF Coarse.\nby George Turner\nWhat is the place of advertising in our\neconomy? Does superior advertising sell\ninferior goods? In persuasion through the\nsubconscious moral?\nThese were but a few of the\nquestions Mr. Desbrow of the Advertising Agency, Garland Compton tackled\nin his talk \"Persuasion is my. Business'' to the term 'B first meeting of\nthe Huxley Society. In its beginning with\nlimited media and intuitive techniques,\nadvertising was a dubious gamble. Today,\nwith the backing of market research and\npsychology and working through moss\nmedia, advertising is a power full economic\nforce. The producer who ignores or neglects\nis taken over; the customer cannot ignore\nTop people and bottom people have their\nminds guided, goaded, and regulated by\nsubtle or direct, factual or emotive advert-ising.\nSome agreed that here was a healthy\nstimulant to the production of quality\ngoods at competitive prices. Others saw\nthe appeal to the emotions and subconscious as an immoral and dangerous prop\nto our economy. The problem is not an\nisolated one. Where to draw the line in\na continuum of technique from simple request to brain washing is a problem in\npolitical, re lie io us, indeed any form of per-sua sion. To be consistent, Mr. Desbrow\ndeclared, we must make the some limits\nfor all. He was satisfied with the status\nou o.

Some of these ore serious enough to\ncause loss of work, but most, while not\npreventing the athlete from earning his\nliving will affect his a bil itv to take part\nin his own sport. The National Health\nService is not really concerned with restoring a patient to the degree of fitness\nrequired for participation in amateur\nsport, and has fully discharged its obligation when the patient is able to perform his day-to-day duties. Before an at-temp can be made to give more help to\nthe injured sportsman, some important\nfacts must be collected, relating to frequency of injuries, how they are treated\nand the length of disability both regarding work and sport.\nThe facts are being collected and analysed by J. G.P. Williams (Luton and\nDustable Hospital) and H. Evans-Robson\n(Loughborough T.C.), who have been\nsending out question n aries to o lub secret-aries. They have asked the Imperial College sports clubs to help in thier injuries\nsurvey, and if as an individual club secretary you have not received a questionnaire,\nand feel you have information which will\nhelp the survey, please contact J. H. Collins through the I.C. Union rack.\nAlthough the weather did not look too\npromising at first, this year's Ski Club\ntrip to Davos in the New Year proved a highly successful venture. Of the many\nski runs situated within easy walking distance of the .hotel the Persenn was undoubtedly the most popular with the\nbetter skiers.

This was a very successful event\nwith eight of the twelve runners finishing\nwithin a minute of each other. The handicap winner was Dick Burt who, doubtless\nstriving to win the magnificent prize of-fe red, ran the course nearly 2 minutes\nfaster than he ever done before or since.\nThe fastest time of the day was 28.58\nby Dave Hammonds who had finished\na fine 6th in the Championships the previous Saturday.\nThe new term started on a victorious\nnote with victories over London Hospital.\nSandhurst, and the Milicarians. The London Hospital match was an easy victory\nfor I.C. by 21 pts. to 59, with I.C. men\nin the first three places. The match against\nSandhurst and Milioarians on the following Saturday (14th Jan) showed the\n*e turn' Do true form of {he Unversity\nCaptain, John Collins, who finished\nsecond to Wood of Sandhurst.

Thus one\nmember was arrested upon landing in\nFrance whilst another was lost for ever\nupon becoming engaged. Also some members (of the feminine variety) were observed to fall rather frequently during instruction periods and then to call for assistance from their bronzed he-man type\ninstructors. What is more, one young lady\nwas found in a prone position at 1.00 a. im\nunder a table in one of the more fashionable hotels I In conclusion, I would like to take this\nopportunity of expressing my thanks to\nthe oom mitte e who worked so well to make\nthis trip a success and to the whole group\nfor their admirable co-operation.

The first\nmatch of the term was against Kingston\n6.S., who beat us by 7-4, the score at\nhalf time being 4-4, in a fast and very\nenjoyable game Against Indian Gymkhana, a team wh i oh has beaten both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, we did\nvery well to be only one goal down it half\ntime but they proved too strong for us\nand eventually won 5-0. The following\nday we lost to King's College in aU.L.

The 1st team now\ngo on to pla v Battersea in the semi-final\non King's College ground; the match will\nbe played on Februarv 11th. The last\ntime the two sides met in the competition\nwas in the 1958-9 semi-final, when I.C. won 3-2. The other semi-final is between\nL.S.E. and King's, who also met in the\n1958-9 semi-final.

The 6th team, somewhat\nn laver s, beat Norwood Tec 12-2 in a friendly match.

Mousset-Jones played\nQ.M. C. II in a league match at Harlington. I.C. were 3-0 up at one stage, but\nQ.M. C. fought back to score twice and\nI.C. were hard-pressed to keep their 3-2\nlead. The 3rd XI, also playing in a league\nfixture, lost to King's TJI by 1-3, but the\n6th XI defeated St. Mary's Hospital 2-1.\nI.

II\nlost to Emmanuel College 12-4, after\ntaking an early 2-0 lead. I. C.V, however,\nplaying Chelsea College II in a home league\nmatch won 6-1.\nOne of the most disappointing features\nof this season has been the large number\nof away fixtures cancelled b v provincial\ncolleges. The biggest offenders have been\nNew College (Oxford), Christ's College\n(Cambridge), and Swansea University,\nwho have all cancelled games on S' a turda v morning. This irresponsible attitude has\ncaused a great deal of wor rv and extra\nwork for the I.C. club officials, and it is\ndistressing to think that on lv Southampton and Leicester Universities o an be relied upon to arrange a fixture in a responsible manner.\nTABLE TENNIS\nNot many matches have been played\nso far this term. The first team had a walk over against King's II who failed to\nturn up for this match. Perhaps the most\nexiting match of the term, so far, was\nthat in which our Vlth team drew 5-5\nwith St. Bart'sI, one of the chief contenders for their league. The IHrd team\nplayed the chief opposition for the first\nplace in their league, West Ham I, but\nI.C. rose to the occasion by winning 8-2.\nI. G.C.

In this article\nI hope to give an account of the events\n\u2022which le rl to this nation-wide student\ncampaign (in which Imperial College did\nnot take part).\nIn 1958 a commit te of experts was set.\nup by the Minister of Education, Sir David\nEccles, to go into the whole question of\nstudent grants and University selection.\nIt had interviews and received memoranda from numerous organization*\neither directly concerned or interested in\nhigher education such as Local Educational Authorities, N.U.S., political par*,\nies. etc. The work of the Anderson CommiHee lasted two years and submitted\nits findings to the Government latt\nSummer.\nThe most important recommendation\nof the Anderson Retort o all s for the total\nabolition of the Means Test, i.e... that\nstudents should receive grants without\nreference to the income of their parents.\nHere are some of the arguments in favour of its abolition:\na. Full time study should be regarded\nas a full time job. After all salaries and\nwages for a job in industry are not depended on parental income, so why\nshould grants be.\nb. Dependanoe on parents' income for\nmaintenance often prevents students\nfrom taking up places at University because their parents are either unable or\nunwilling to maintain them.\nc. The Means Test very often enables\nparents to exert on students an undesirable amount of oo ero ion by threatening to with old financial support unless\nthey arrange their lives as their parents\nwish. This o cours more often than is\nimagined, particularly amongst women\nstudents who wish to marry.\nd. The abolition of the parental contribution would encourage more parents\nto keen their children to sixth form level\nnt soho ol, making it possible for them\nto go to Universitv. This would help to\nachieve the declared aim of the Minister\ni.e., the training of as many graduates\nas possible as a matter of vital importance to the Country, instead of losing\nevery year, as must be the case, a considerable number of potential students.\ne. Surprising as it may seem, the\ncost of administering the Means Test\nwould be greater than the cost of abolish-ng it.\nThr* Report, also recommends the abolition of State Scholarships and the introduction of a uniform grants to cover\nScotland as well as England and' Wales;\nthat all those with two G.C.E.' s at \"A\" level who have been accepted for a first\ndegree should reo e ive awards from public\nfunds. Other recommendations of the\nReport deal with dependant allowances,\nNational Insurance contributions, administration of awards, etc., for which I have no space to go into here.\nThe Government attitude to the recommendations of the Report has been dis-appointing, to say the least. The Minister\nof Education has refused to abolish the\nMeans Test and is eo mm it ed to partial\nabolition only. In a statement in the\nHouse of Commons he declared that the\nminimum parental income at wh i oh contribution is required would be raised from\n\u00a3525 to \u00a3700. This rise in the minimum\nin oom e for contribution is very small in-deed, especially when increase in average\nearnings since 1958 (when the \u00a3525\nlower limit was fixed) are taken into ac-count. In doing this the Minister has com-Iceberg* *tt Qenhmmlmn*\nEXPLORATION SOCIETY\nb v John Sheard\nThe Exploration Society has held a full\nprogramme of meetings this term. Five\nlectures come from members of last year's expeditions and three other talks will be\ngiven by Tony Smvst, leader of the 1961\nRoyal Air Force Karakoram Expedition,\nDependencies Survey and by Dr. John\nFrancis who ao com pani ed the 1953 I.C. Carribean Expedition.\nWe have held our first Hop and the\n'Exploration Review' has again been published and is now on sale.\nThe Annual Dinner, to be held shortly,\npromises to be most successful. The Society and its members have invited many\nguests of distinction in the field of ex-plo ration. We feel that this is one of the\nfew ways in which we can show our appreciation for the extremely generous help\nand advice we are constantly receiving.\nThe programme is completed by a General Studies lecture to be given b v Professor G.E. Finch, F.R.S., on March\n16th. Full details of all the meetings will\nbe found on the Society's notice board in\nthe Union Entrance Hall.\nFinally, it is now time to be think in e of expeditions in the 1962 season, and if\nyou are at all interested in exploration\nplease come to our meetings. The Society\nhas a wealth of experience amongst its\nmembers and if we cannot answer your\nqueries, we will certainly be able to put\nvo u in touch with someone\" who o an. \u2014 OLD HOSTEL \u2014\nDESECRATED\nICWA ATTAKS.\nNever before, in the whole of its long\nand colourful his to rv. has the Old Hostel\nkno.m such dreadful outrages as those\nwhich Dccured on the night of Friday\n20th January. With the noise of a baby\nelephant three ICwarians descended upon\na poor defenceless, but eminently respectable and in-offensive young gentleman en\nthe fifth floor. Armed with six-foot long\npoisonous spears they launched an entirely unprovoked attack. Vicious onslaught\nfollowed vicious onslaught and it was not\nlong before the poor victim was trodden\nremorselessly underfoot. Not satisfied\nwith this the three barbarians began to\nplug the ventilation holes in the ceiling,\nhoping no doubt to suffocate their victim.\nIn this they failed, however. They were\nbeaten back by the sheer number of holes\n\u2014 42,000 of them. Undaunted they turned\ntheir attention to the window. \"Let us\nhelp you out.\" they offered. It was a good seventy foot drop to the back of\nMooney's kitchen. \"Do have some coffee.\"\nsaid the victim, in despair. That was it.\nHe was saved. He had found the focal\npoint of the weakness. With their insatiable add io tion to coffee they could no\nlonger resist. After two o ups they were le-duce d to a state of complete docility and\nbeing quite incapable their ejection then\noffered no problems.\np let ely disregarded the recommendations\nof the Anderson Report, wh i oh were the\nresult of two years investigation by a committee of experts in education of Ms\nown choosing.\nHowever, the matter is not necessarily\nsettled by the Minister's statement. In\nspite of the Minister's statement, I do\nbelieve that the Government can be\nbrought to appreciate the full extent of\nstudent feeling on this question of the\nMeans Test. A way to So this is to take\nsome kind of action which would make\nour opinion known to people in positions\nof re sposi bil it y and to the public at large.\nHere are some examples of what other\nColleges and Universities have done:\nThe University of Southampton: wrote\nto all M.P.s represent ng constituencies in\ntheir area and arranged to meet many\nof them.\nLondon School of Economics: The Union\nsent a delegation of students which interviewed about 25 M.P. B. University of Exeter: The President\nwrote to M.P.s and also to \"The Times\".\nUniversity of Oxford: arranged a petition to Parliament against the Means\nTest, which amassed 1500 signatures in\n4 days.\nA group of students from University\nCollege, Goldsmiths and other London\ncolleges saw Mr Peter von Straubenzee,\nParliamentary Private Secretary to the\nM'n is ter of Education who told them\nthat he had been asked by the Government to circularize all Conservatives\nM.P.s with a document giving the pros\nand cons of the Means Test so that they\nwould be sufficiently aqua in ted w \"th the\nproblem when meeting students in the\nlobbies. So much for those who say that\nsending petitions, lobbying Parliament,\netc. is useless and has no effect.\nYet this seems to be the attitude of our\nUnion, which has done nothing about\n\u2022rants for aave rv long time indeed. T hope this state of affairs will gradually\nimprove. Alreadv a resolution on the\ngrants question is beine prepared for the\nnext Union meeting which seems to be\na step in the right direction.\nUNION\nMEETING\nIn the Concert Hall at 1 p.m. on Thursdav 9th February. The agenda includes a motion from Mr. W.S. MpAuley that\n\"This Union meeting supporters the abolition of the Means Test as recommended\nb v the Anderson Committee, and instructs\nCouncil to organize activities in support\nof this policy.\" The motion will be\nseconded by Mr. T. Feldberg who has\nwritten the above article.\nREVULU PRESENTS\nDONT JUST STAND THERE\nU.L. U. FEBRUARY 14TH18 TH "

    "content": "FELIX 3\nLOVE\nTHAT UNION\nby Diogenes\nUnder the title \"What's wrong with\nT.C.?\", Mr Cox discusses the question of\nhow to increase the effectiveness of a University education. Not a new question,\nbut one that cannot be raised too often,\nit seems. One fears that he is beating\nh \u00abB head against a Red-Brick wall. The\nfact is that rao^t students res rard the\nUnion as they regard National Health\nat all times as incidental, even irrelevant,\nto their lives as a whole. This attitude\ndoes sees to be at variance with the trends\nof modern democratic life, I admit.\nNowadays participation is the theme; we\nshould each see ourselves as an integral\npart of the society in which we live.\nI agree that a University Education\nshould do more than impart sci et if ic knowledge. Since the development of the\nhuman r,n i mal is a restatement of an evolutionary process, the object of any education is surely to bring the process up\nto date. Social education is that at least\nas important in these as the assimilation\nof historical facts, of which scientific discoveries form a small part. No person\nwhose education is strongly biased in any\none direction whilst almost totally lacking in others could be said to be mature.\nOne asks, though, whether maturity in\nthis sense is a desirable ohara ch teri stic to\npossess nowadays. It would require a longer, more expensive (and un pro duc ive) period of education. Worse, it seems\nto imply the idea of in vi dual responsibility of action, which is going rapidly\nout of fashion. Why think things out for\nourselves when there are others better\nqualified to do it for you? Act as you\nthink everyone else will think best; after\nall, we've never had it so good! When\nMr. Cox says that he is passionately attached to certain rather revolutionary\nideas, he is treading on dangerous ground\nindeed. Dispassionate a quiescence is the\nthing. Forward the Young Conservatives!\nOne notes that the extensive use of\nantibiotics results in resistant strains cf\nbacteria. Could it be that excess cf\n\"Organisation\" in our environment is\nproducing organisation-resistant strains (.f students? If they cannot ignore the\ndemands of society in the form of University \"education\" they can at least ignore\nthe Student's Union.\nMr. Cox diagnoses, quite correctly, that\nwe should increase the doses of organisation and participation to counteract this.\nSome new and more drastic forms are\nneeded too. How about an advert \"Love\nyour Union\" during the break in \"Mav-erick\"? Another obvious line of attack\nwould be to bu il cf up the President as\na Father Figure, or something.\n\u00a3e tU%d to the CdUox\nT)en r Sir, / ^\"1 CARNIVAL QUEEN\nMUMI WHY WAS I BORN?So often these days it seems a la mode\nto lack an ideology. Things may be taken\nso far that it not unusual to crash into\npeople who make an ideology out of not\nhaving an ideology. Almost to the point\nof chaining themselves to the railings of\nParliament, they claim their heritage is\nthe Suffragette Movement; deny us our\nvote, or we throw ourselves beneath the\nQueen's horses.\nThis particularly so with students,\nImperial stock with a vengeance. So\njealously do they guard their lack of purpose that they run in great danger of premature senility through voluntary isola t ion. Existentialism; their articulate\nmouths si eze up, their fertile brains ore\nunable to distinguish between quality and\nquantity, and God knows what happens\nto their souls.\nAs my New Year's Resolution, according\nto the Union caretakers, is not to speak at\nUnion meetings, I feel obliged to proffer\na solution on paper to the above dile mna. It is easy enough these days to find an\nideology, purpose, cause, or all three. All\nthat is required are the initial assumptions that our con tempo ries are worth living with, sharing things with, co-operating\nwith and enjoying. The only real dificult y is developing an open mind and NCcepting that a mutual intercourse is bene-fic i al, constructive and in no way involving a sacrifice of principles we don't hold\nanyway. We of the C. N.D. like to think\nthat we are at least moving towards a state of ppen-mindedness, and to emphasise our progress we intend to hold our\n\"C. N.D. Mission to I.C.\" on the 13th to the 18th of February. In this period\nwe are expecting a great rush of folks to\nour meetings where we look forward to\nmany and great opened-minded deliberations. By the 19th we anticipate that\nthe I.C. Aldermaston contingent will l>e either non-existent or 1000 strong. Which\nis it to be?\nD. Finney\nWHAT'S RIGHT WITH I.C. Dear Sir,\nI am often asked why 1 am so passionately attached to such ideas as I.C. Union\nnot joining NUS, ICWA not being\nallow ted in the bar, etc., etc, and in\nthis article I intend to say why and\nnot, like Mr. Cox, make a number of assertions of doubtful validity.\nIf one looks at the Blue Boob, one can\nread therein the terms of reference (f the I.C. Union. They are, briefly, to foster\nthe social and athletic, as opposed to the\nacademic, welfare of the individual\nstudent. In this I think the Union succeeds. We can be justifiably proud of\nour sporting record, second to none in\nthis University, and our social and recreational clubs cater for very nearly all likes\nand dislikes. One can do practically any-thing, within reason, in this Union, and\nI think everyone agrees that's how it\nshould be.\nBut one thing makes me feel like adopt*\ning a policy of unlimited ph y sio al violence,\nand that is the eternal whining and moaning of one section of the Union. 'Why\ndon't we join NUS?\" they cry, We must\nhave equality of the sexes; let ICWA into the bar l\" they yell. And all the time\nthey are emphasising what a large majority of the Union already know: that the\nyeller s and the cryer s are nothing but\npower-seeking demagogues, who allow\nthe mouth to function when the brain is\nI have often had occasion to complain\nof the apathy of some Union members,\nbut most of tb^m, thank Heavenl, have\ntheir heads screwed on the right way.\nFor a small fee Mr. Cox o an join NUS .\nMr. Finney can mar oh to Timbuctoo for\nall I care; but until the majority of Union\nmembers take leave of their senses, the\nI.C. Union will continue to a ot sensibly\nand moderately.\nYours faithfully,\nJ. Carter\nWhat's wrong with I.C.? Whv it\nthat, at regular intervals. Union of fic in ls and various others tell us that if we are\nto obtain a Universitv education, we must\nwrite articles, b uv magazines, attend\nUnion meetings, run carnivals, etc., etc.?\nSurely this is putting the proverbial cart\nbefore the horse. These student activities\nare praise-worthy enough, but are no more\nthan evidence of a state of mind; the\nproblem is not solved by producing more\noutlets for interest, but by producing the\ninterest.\nAs I see it, there are two main faults\nwith I.C. Primarily the over-special is ation of the oo lle ge as a whole. This is worsened by the segregation, which comes so naturally to such a large organisation from the\nrest of the Unversity. Secondly, there is\nthe well worn criticism of the lack of\nHostel accommodation. Both of these\nfaults are easily overcome by the interested student, and many do overcome\nthem, but there is no denying that they\nare aids to narrow-mindedness. Ah, but\nthere are General Studies and Touchstone\nweekends, we are told! I would suggest\nthat these are not by any means sufficient\nreplacements as stimulants, although both\nin themselves praise-worthy attempts.\nIn any case the picture is not as black\nas some would paint it. As a fresher I have been most impressed by the wide\nrange of societies and activities of the\nUnion. Further, there is a marked tend-en cy, when others do not share \"our\"\ninterests, to dismiss them as people without interests. I have as yet met few of\nthe \"morons\" that I have been told so\nmuch about.\nNeither does all the fault (if fault there\nis) lie with I.C., for we must puss s goodly share to the general educational\npolicies of the century. I believe that\nmuch harm is done by our cram mer school system and \"You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's lug' not tv en at I.C. Your sincerely,\nGeorge Turner.\nViewpoints COMMENT. by J. Cox\nPeople have often asked me who\n\"R.T.L. Fotheringham\" is. Many appear\nto believe that I write oo unter comment,\npurposely using silly arguments to show\nup my case better. This is not so. \"R.T.L. Fotheringham.\" is a pseudonym for a gentleman who writes, and believes in\ncounter-comment. His article is written\nafter mine has been received by the\nEditor.\nI have never objected to him having\nthe last word, because I doubt whether\nmy \"Comments\" would have been published otherwise. But I do object to him\nbecoming a censor as well. This week,\nI would like to amplify a statement\n\"Fotheringham\" deleted from my last\nCommen. I hope that his will not mean\nthe deletion of the entire article.\nI attempted, in my last article, to\ndeplore the fact that i.C. Union has no\npolicy' on grants. Virtually every other\nStudent's Union in Britain has some sort\nof policy; in virtually every other college\nin Britain, students will have discussed\nvarious aspects of higher education at one\ntime or another. But at I.C. some of our\nleaders seem to think that there is something degrading in discussing student\naffairs.\nSurely, in a healthy community, every\ncitizen should be well-informed about his\nown affairs. If a student does not attempt\nto understand student affairs, will he,\nwhen he leaves oo lle ge, take a wide interest in industrial affairs? If a citizen is\nincapable of assessing the validity of political propaganda in his own field, is he\njustified in voting at an e leo tion? I believe that it is necessary for us to\ndo our training as citizens while we are\nin college. Our society's administration is\nelected on the principle of \"one man \u2014\none vote\". At every level of society, including I.C., we should always try to ensure that this becomes \"one thinking man\n\u2014 one vote\".\nSurely we should realise that I.C. is\ndifferent to other colleges not because of\nits superiority, but due to its lethargy.\nWe are now the only students of a major\ncollege not affiliated to NUS. We accept\nall the benefits won for students by NUS,\nbut be o a use of the ignorance of student\naffairs at I.C. it is still possible for some\nto say, \"NUS is ineffective.' '\nWith the affiliation of K.C.L. and\nBangor to to NUS, it is no longer possible\nto speak of colleges inside or outside NUS.\nPAM GREGORY INC. COMPANY NOTICES.\nfed February 1961.\nCOUNTER COMMENT. by R.T.L. Fotheringham\nI am sorry to see that Mr. Cox is now\nusing his so-called 'Comment' column for\npersonal attacks. However, hi B article is\nideal for presenting the case for the nec ess itv of 'Counter-Comment'.\n,In his articles Mr. Cox presents one\nside of a cont rover cia l topic; it is surely\nreasonable that the other side should be\nrepresented. Also the 'Comment' column\noften contains material errors which must\nbe corrected. An example of this was last\nissue's suggestion that the Student Union\nshould take over the Refectory, which it\ndoes not even own.\nI shall now correct this week's in ac curacies.\n1. I do not necessarily believe in what\nI write. When this series was started T was commissioned to write a weekly art iole presenting the opposite point of view to\nMr. Cox.\n2. Mr. Cox's articles reach th'e Editor\non Saturday. The paper goes to bed on\nSunday, If Mr. Cox was available on\nSunday, or willing to write his article\nearlier, he would be able to read CounterComment and amend his own column\naccordingly.\n3. His article would be printed even if\nthere was NO Counter-Comment.\n4. I did not censor his last article.\nThe Editor cut part of this last article\nbecause it was too long for the new pro-ces s, four page Felix. The cutting was\ndone in such a manner as to cause the\nleast dist rup tion to his rambling discourse.\nMr. Cox was informed of this cut and\nthe reason for it.\nAs to the rest of Comment this week\nI should like to point out that the reason\nI.C. are not members of N.U.S. is because a Union Meeting last year decided\nthat we did not want to join. Here we\nhave an example of Mr. Cox's much\nlauded demo or a oy in action, but he is\nthe last person to accept the majority\ndecision. For the fifth issue in succession\nwe have the usual 'plug' for N.U.S. I wonder if he gets a commission 1\nWe are now an insignificant minority, years\nbehind the rest of British students in the\nunderstanding and appreciation of our own\naffairs. At I.C. we lack completely one\nof the main ingredients of a balanced University education.\nI hope \"Fotheringham\" will not try to\nexcuse his censorship on the grounds that\ngrants have nothing to do with \"What's wrong with IC?\"\nPersonal Dept.
