More? MORE!?! No one has ever asked for more.\nMr Mooney clicks his fingers and the Chorus\nof Spanish Waitresses trumps in.\nChorus of waitresses (singing in Spanish\naccents)\nDarbyshire, Darbyshire, Never before has a boy wanted more,\nDarbyshire, Darbyshire\nNon haciendo, sen or, per favor.\nMr Mooney: For God sake shut-up, you old\nbags, or I 'll send you back to Fulham where I found you.\n(turning to Eric) And as for you, young fellow\nme lad, you good-for-nothing lay about \u2014\nyou'd better go before the Rector.\nEric: But what use would I be to him? I'm good for nothing (rubbing his eyes blearily).\nMooney: Are you i deed? Well you're\nbanished to Estates, in that case.\nEric packs his belongings into a soiled\nhandkerchief, and is escorted out of the\nkitchens by Choruses of Waitresses. They\ntake him to the Estates Department where\nthe Fire Alarms, Telephones and other\ndisasters are arranged.\nScene II\nUnion Office\nThe Union Office staff sit around with their\nfeet up, slurping sherry, and complaining\nabout their work-load.\nAunty Jenny is getting sherry from the\nintravenous drip, Dave Parry.\nSuddenly the befuddled calm of the office is\nshattered as Hippo Claybrain hurtles in:\nHippo: Snort, pew, grunt.\nAunty Jenny: Darling, what do you mean\n'Mooney's banished Eric'. Where's he\nbanished him to?\nHippo: Estates,snort.\nAunty Jenny: Oh don't worry de a rie \u2014 it'll\nbe weeks before they do anything to him.\nHave a nice sherry \u2014 it'll help you get your\nbreath back.\nHippo: Gosh, thanks Aunty.\nAunty serves the sherry - but unseen by the\nothers sneaks off into her office and dials\none-seven-oh, the. secret hot-line to the\nRector.\nClje ^res ii bent Jflan or pull?\n-a Victorian melodrama in one act-Scene III\nRector's Flat\nIan Bull sits on the hearth-rug in the Rector's drawing room, idly stoking the fire. The\nRector reclines in a deep arm chair giving Ian\nhis instructions for the week. Every few\nminutes Sir Henry Bufton-Tufton of that Ilk,\nGovernor-in-Chief, jumps out from behind\nthe sofa and shouts 'I disagree, I disagree'!\nThe Rector ignores these interjections.\nSuddenly a red and gold telephone rings\nfaintly - the Rector answers.\nRector: Hallo, Baron of Queensgate.\nAunty Jenny (for it is she): Hallo, de a rie. Can you tell lan, they've varnished the Union\ngates.\nRector: Can you speak up, please. This is a College telephone, you know.\nAunty Jen (screeching) CAN YOU TELL\nIAN, THEY' VE BANISHED ERIC TO ESTATES.\nThe Rector drops the telephone receiver and\nturns to Ian, who is by now asleep.\nRector: Wake up, young fool, they've\nbanished Eric to Estates.\nSir Bufton-Tufton: Don't call me a fool, you\nold fool.\nRector: Not you, you fool, it's Ian I'm talking\nto.\nIan (awake): But what am I going to do?\nRector: I don't know, go and get him back, I expect.\nIan: But I can't do that. Nobody ever returns\nfrom Estates.\nLady Flowers enters, stage left, obeying the\nno entry signs pinned to the other doors,\ncarrying a tray of sausages.\nLady Flowers: Come on, you've all got to\neat up your b angers \u2014 I won't take no for an\nanswer!\nIan: (groan) Oh, all right then, just one\nmore.\nAs Ian eats the sausage, a curious\ntr an formation takes place. Horns begin to\nsprout from his head, his nose becomes\nbroader, and his ears long and hairy. He\nstarts grunting and snorting, and then\ncharges towards the open French Windows,\nand out into the garden.\nLady Flowers: Well that's what I call\ngratitude \u2014 I shall never hold another beer\nand b angers as long as I live.\nScene IV\nEric in Estates\nEric sits in the Estates lair. He is alone, for\nthe entire Estates section is 'in a meeting'\naccording to their secretary. Around Eric,\non the floor, lie hundreds of old dial\ntelephones removed by Estates during the\nphone modernization scheme.\nEric lifts one of the dirty instruments, and\nidly starts to rub the handset.\nSuddenly, in a puff of smoke, a figure\nappears.\nAunty Jenny: Hallo de a rie, your wish is my\ncommand.\nEric: (Rubbing his bleary eyes) But who\nare You?\nAunty Jenny: Why I'm the Jenny of the\nphone of course, your fairy godmother. Now\nwhat's your first wish.\nEric; Well, I'd like a sherry, please.\nAunty Jenny: Yes, of course deary. But\nwhat sort.\nEric: I 'll have a pale, please.\nAunty Jenny: (giggling) A pail? Why de a rie, isn't the glass big enough?\nAunty Jenny (handing Eric the sherry): And\nfor your second wish?\nEric: Oh that's easy. Please get me out of\nEstates \u2014 I can't bear all this sitting around,\ndoing nothing.\nAunty Jenny skips round the sherry bottle\nthree times and taps it with her wand.\nJust at that moment the mad bull crashes\nthrough the flimsy Estates doors and\nscreeches to a halt.\nAunty Jenny and Eric jump on his back\nand he charges out towards Mooney's kitchens.\nScene V Mr Mooney's kitchen (later)\nThe three chefs prance naked around the\nstove in canting: Double, double boil and trouble\nFire burn and cauldron bubble\nEye of newt, and toe of frog\nWool of bat, and tongue of dog.\nMooney: By the pricking of my thumbs,\nsomething wicked this way comes.\nEnter mad Bull, Eric and Aunty Jenny.\nAccompanied by Hippo, the Rector, Sir\nHenry Bufton-Tufton of that Ilk, Chorus of\nWaitresses, Dave Parry's girlfriend,\nRefectory Suggestions and Complaints\nCommittee, Internal Services Committee\nand the combined Refectory Boycott.\nAunty Jenny: Oh Victor dear ie,I implore\nyou, won't you relent?

And it is pointing directly at them -for a moment no one moves. But then Hippo\nstrides across the refectory and defiantly\njumps into the barrel of the trumpet\nHippo (laughing as she is drawn into the\nmechanism): No sausage trumpet can\nsurvive this!\nMooney: Damn it! She's jammed my\ntrumpet. I concede. I concede. Eric is\nun banished!

    "content": "\u2022FELIX\nFELIX\nAt this time of year reflection and evaluation\npreoccupy the thoughts of most of the\npopulace. It seems fitting to examine the\nperformance of those we elected as sabbatical\nofficers last year.\nMr Ian Bull got off to a good start at the\nbeginning of the year by asserting his\nauthority and generally bossing everyone\naround. (Have you noticed that small men\nare often the most dictatorial). Ian keeps the\nUnion ticking-over, much like his\npredecessors, but seems to lack a wider vision\nof Union affairs. He seems too busy sitting on\ncommittees and conducting interviews to be\nbothered with the individual student, or to\nspare a thought for the future of the Union.\nAnd this is quite a serious fault. The College\ncan easily exploit any lack of continuity in\nUnion thinking.\nDave 'Mad' Parry is widely expected to be\ncertified insane before next term. He rushes\naround from room to room screaming 'I'm late, I'm late' rather like the white rabbit. He\nis paranoid (always one of the first signs),\nbelieving that all Union Officers are trying to\nfiddle more money out of the Union. They\nprobably are, but nobody, and certainly not\nthe DP, is ever meant to notice.\nEric Darbyshire does his job competently,\nbut with a laid-back attitude that disguises\nhis hard work. I feel sorry for Hon Sees. The\nother sabbaticals seem to give them all the\nboring jobs to do like taking minutes and\noperating the Gestetner.\nThere is a real need, once again, to re-write\nthe Hon See's job description so as to attract\ncandidates of an appropriate calibre. Who\nbetter to do this re-write than Eric himself?\nSometimes life gets one down. I sit in my\nnewly-repainted office in Beit Quad watching\nyou walk by, happy, relaxed enjoying\nyourselves. And then... a disaster occurs.\nThere's nothing like a good disaster in\nCollege to brighten up the pages of FELIX. Someone resigns, a road accident, public\ndisagreements\u2014these are the stuff of news,\nfor good news is no news which is bad news\nfor everyone, especially me. So keep on at it\nfolks. If you've got a dispute don't settle it,\nbut have a good public row we can all enjoy.\nPoint out the mistakes of others, make\nunjustified complaints\u2014stand on your\nheads, but for goodness sake, please do\nsomething interesting!\nI'm sure that they were saying 'Christmas\nstarts earlier every year' much earlier this\nyear.\nBut I don't know that this is such a bad\nthing. At Christmas time a spirit of goodwill\nseems to enter the hearts of most people,\nwhatever their religion, or lack of it.\nDismiss this as slushy, clich ed sentimentality if you will, but it wouldn't be a very bad thing if it continued throughout the\nyear.\nWhen Christmas finally does come, may it\nbe a very happy one for you all.\nAcknowledgements\nMy thanks for help on this, and every FELIX this term, are due to Ajay, Grenville, Pete,\nNigel, Hugh, Hugh, Dave Jones, Jon Jones,\nJon Burgess, Pete Coleman, Chris Martin,\nPete Hands, Farah Ali, Diane Love, Richard,\nTinker, Finian, Martin, Nick Gillies,\nRosemary and Tony.\nFelix is published by the Editor for and on behalf of\nImperial College Union Publications Board and is printed\nby the Union Print Unit, Imperial College, Prince Consort\nRoad, London SW7.\nTelephone 01-589 51 1 1 Ext 3515\nEditor: David Rowe, Business Manager: Martin Taylor,\nAdvertising Manager: Paul Belford.\nCopyright FELIX 1984.

    "content": "CFEATURE;\nNext term, the dullest, most tedious\ncompetition IC Union has to offer will\nbegin. We are talking, of course, about\nthe elections for President. While\nFELIX Editor and Deputy President\nboth involve hard work and require real\ntalent, to get yourself elected President\nyou need different qualities: egotism,\nmegalomania and the ability to drink at\ngreat length all help, but most\nimportantly you need to be able to\nencourage everyone to believe that you\nare simply the only one for the job.\nLast year, smart-arse Ian Bull managed\nto pull this con-trick with admirable\nskill. Perhaps squiring the then\n(female) President, Gaynor Lewis all\nyear did something to help. However,\nthis year no such obvious candidate\nhas appeared. But this does not mean\nthat the position is open to all takers.\nWe all know that the average student\nhas less than a snowball's chance in\nhell of becoming President. No, the\npost will go to one of the so-called\nhacks-people who have spent two,\nfour or even five years sipping sherry\nin the Union Office, sitting on obscure\nand largely ineffectual committees and\nproposing the odd (but never\ncontroversial) UGM motion. How many\nof you have ever done any of these?\nNow let's get on and look at some of\nthe candidates who might become\nNEXT YEAR'S Carl Burgess\nIncontinent ex-rag mag\neditor, Carl inhabits a strange\nworld of drunken ess and\ndelusion. He stood for\nPresident two years ago on a furry toilet seat platform and\nwill probably stand again this\nyear on anything he can find.\nHe is reported to have\naddressed the hustings U GM in Italian, Greek and sign-language as well as English,\nwith the aid of three\nsimultaneous translators.\nWhether this gained him any\nminority votes is unclear. As\nyou may have realised, Carl\ncan only command the status\nof a joke candidate, and such\npeople rarely win ICU\nelections.\nJoanna Claydon\nDuring the last year, as\nExternal Affairs Officer,\nJoanna has been a constant\nreminder that some students\nsuffer horribly from inflation.\nMany, however, consider her\nnickname 'Hippo Claybrain'\ngrossly unfair. It has been\nstated in her defence that she\ndoes, after all, have the grace\nand dignity of a reversing\nelephant. We at FELIX are the\nlast to be hippo critical. We\ndon't want to make too much\nof her singing Bestiality's Best\nat a recent bar night, either.\nHow else is a hippo to have\nsome fun?\nMike 'Baldthing' Stuart\nAs ex-Guilds President and\nWelfare Officer, altruistic,\nresponsible, knowledgeable\nand mature enough to accept\nhis nearly hairless state,\n'Baldthing' would be an ideal\ncandidate were it not for one\nthing\u2014he has been recognised as a 'wet', and in ICU\npolitics, that is fatal.\nJ Martin Taylor\nWithout doubt, Boolery\nWoolery is the most ably\nqualified candidate having sat\non more committees than he's eaten hot dinners in his fifty\nyears here to date.\nHis most noteworthy skill\n(apart from his rare wit and\nintelligence) is the ability to\ntalk indefinitely on any\nsubject. His three major\nhandicaps are:\n1. His funny regional accent\n(he hails from Lancashire)\ninvariably reduces a captive\naudience to tears, boredom, a hypnotic trance, or most\noften, to incapacitating\nhysteria.\n2. His extreme right-wing\nviews are anathema to most\nimpoverished students and so\nhe would be well advised to\nkeep his oblong mouth shut as\nmuch as possible.\n3. Due to an unfortunate\npersonality disorder he finds\nthe recommendation in 2\nimpossible.\nPerhaps these faults were to\nblame for his defeat in the\nPresidential elections two\nyears ago. But since then,\nBoolery Woolery has had the\nhighlights put in his hair and\nexchanged his glasses for\ncontact lenses, and thus\ndisguised, will probably stand\nagain.\nJ Martin's new look\nHugh 'Bigbum' Southey\nThe youngest of the field,\nBigbum is known as the blue-haired, blond-eyed boy of\nFELIX and the buffoon of IC\nRadio. He is so energetic and\nenthusiastic that he tends to\nleap about in conversations.\nAlthough widely regarded as\nnaive, Bigbum does have\nconsiderable expertise in both\nUnion Affairs and pub-li cations; in other words a right pain in the arse!\na Huge cheeky smile\nHugh Greystoke' Stiles\nWithout doubt the most\nsham boli c and foot festering*\ncandidate, and at best a rank\noutsider, Greystoke (so called\nbecause of his biannual dress\nsense) is nevertheless an\nexperienced Union Officer.\nDespite his shy and retiring\nmanner, Greystoke is\ncurrently engaged in shit-stirring in the Chemical\nEngineering Department.\n(This does not mean that he\never had anything to do with\nGuildshit).\n* doesn't change his socks\nSo there you have it\u2014the best\nICU has to offer. Who will you\nvote for?\nFELIX\nWednesday 12 December 1984\n\n"

    "content": "QSPORT\nORIENTEERING\nWeekend\norgy?\nT 'was the 'o' event to end them\nall when Imperial took on Oxford\nUniversity, Kent Poly, and\neveryone else last weekend in\nScrotty Woods.\nBrowning really put the skids\nunder the opposition for a van-slide win in M2IE, beating Bloor\n(who hadn't drawn the map this\nweek) and the top Imperial men.\nForster ran like he was carrying a sackful of potatoes, while Andy\nand his EX VOC chums had\nstopped to play with the sheep.\nEppington, who had drunk a whole pint of cider the night\nbefore (Sally helped) didn't feel\nwell at all; while Wu wan the\nwong way and hasn't been seen\nsince.\nMeanwhile, in W21, Sally was\nleft holding the trophy after a Controller's enquiry into Patsy's elastic stocking revealed the\nshocking truth!\nTABLE TENNIS\nClose to\nvictory\nAs the term draws to a close I thought I would write a summary\nof what has been happening on\nthe top floor of the Union\nBuilding.\nThis year we have five teams in\nthe Central London League:\nTeam one, although not having\nactually won any matches yet in\nDivision two are improving and\nare only just losing each game.\nTeam list: Wladeh Forysiah,\nGeo/ Parsons, David Rhodes\nand various Team two members.\nTeam two, got off to a flying\nstart, appearing top of Division\nfour on the last table produced.\nThis is ai! due to good teamwork\nand we ail hope that the results\nkeep coming in next term.\nTeam list: Graeme Cant,\nAndy Lewry, David Gallagher,\nDetlef Kopp and Pong Leung.\nTeam three are the dark horse\nof the group. As the results only\nappear on the sheets periodically\ntheir present form is not known.\nHowever from all accounts they\nare doing all right so far.\nTeam list Brian Norminton, L Sabotinov, Kim Male,NChahal,\nSteve Desbruslais.\nTeam four, having won their first\nmatch of the season 9-0 have\nbeen losing all subsequent\nmatches by a similar margin.\nThis state of affairs should\nimprove though next term now\nthat the players have gained\nsome league experience.\nTeam list: Richard Homan,\nJoseph Monkham, Mike\nShewan, Dean Sarson,\nMatthew Bridgewater and\nRadar Nuwayhid.\nTeam five, in the words of the\ndivisional secretary 'Erica's doing a grand job'! They have put\ntogether some good team\nperformances and have reaped\nthe rewards in the form of a string of good (Many against\nteams well above them in the\nDivision). Their first match next\nterm should be interesting\nhowever, as they are scheduled\nto meet Team four who are\ndetermined to secure their\nsecond victory of the season as\nsoon as possible.\nTeam list:Erica Parkes,\nRichard Brookfield, Christine\nSpears, Gerry NG, D Tilley,\nJohn Tilley, John Davies.\nHopefully there should be\nsome more regular reports\nprinted next term as the season\nreally starts hot ting up. So keep a look out and if you're interested\nin playing in a team come up any\nWednesday afternoon. We will\nbe very pleased to see you. Also\nthe TT ladder is in operation now\n.and is open to all members so\ncome up and join it if you don't want the commitment of Team\nplay but want some competition.\nGOLF\nChristmas\nchallenge\nLast Wednesday IC golfing\nSociety held their Christmas 36\nhole stable ford competition.\nAdam would have won if the\nweather had had a Zambian\nflavour to it. However Dave Long\nbeing over-handicapped at four\nwas hard pushed to gain a narrow victory over Jeff Morris.\nThe other seven players also\nachieved memorable performances although Bill Passmore did\nmanage a meagre 38 points for\nthe entire 36 holes, and was\nsubsequently last. Perhaps he\nshould worry less about cheque\nbooks and it was suggested that\nhe return to his skis! Despite this\nbad performance by Bill who was\ntwo down with three to play\nagainst the treasurer he did\nmanage to win thanks to 'Dimwit'\nChris three putting the last two\ngreens.\nImproving weather conditions\nin the afternoon did not enable\nHuw Jones to improve. In the\ngathering dusk the less\ncompetent players finally holed\nout as the clubhouse lights\ntwinkled beyond the 18th green.\nAn excellent meal was followed\nby a concerted attack on the\nSudbury fruit machine and Bill\nwas once again a loser.\nOn a more serious note new\nmembers are welcomed and if\nthere is any interested beginners\nmaybe able to get sub sidi sed tuition, otherwise next term\nthere will be a pairs 'four ball better ball' competition as well as\nfriendlier s. Finally congratulations go the Captain Phil who\nmanaged to knock a ball onto the\ntube line at Park Royal station.\nBADMINTON\nEnd of the\nroad\nUAU Ladies Badminton last 16\nIC(South East 2) Vs Bradford\n(East Midlands 1)\nDespite our (near) perfect\nperformance which enabled us\nto get this far, this occasion not a memorable performance in\nterms of both team participation\nand success.\nArriving at King's Cross at the\nunearthly hour of 9am on\nWednesday, we learnt that two\nof our players had, the previous\nnight, unearthed unsuitable (yet\neffective) reasons j or not playing:\ntoo much work. (This apparently\noverlooked the fact that we were\n6 hours on BR trains\u2014allowed\nunlimited work).\nHence, the team which left for\nBradford consisted of only four\nplayers: Julie Goodeve, Farida\nKatelli, Jane Radford and Susan\nYates. This team faced with the\nproblem that we had already\nconceded three games, and\nwould have to win five out of the\nremaining six to win the match.\nUnfortunately( for us),\nBradford produced a good team,\nand we won only three out of the\nremaining six games, leaving\nBradford with a six-three win.\nSincere thanks to all those\nwho have participated in U AU Badminton Matches (Ladies and\nMens), and our success can only\nimprove next year!\n10-PIN BOWLING\nThrashed\nWell, we did it again! The 'crack'\nIC bowling squad cracked! Yes,\nanother 10-0 thrashing by\nSouthampton Univ. They even\ndecided to toy with us by hiding\nfour of their team members.\nActually, the rules say that if a missing team member does not\nrun up during the first half of a game, the team must do without\nthem. Their missing four just\nturned up with virtually seconds\nto spare. Dammit, we might have\ntaken a few points off them!\nSo, what about the match?\nThe A team played below par\nand lost. The B team again had a closer match and were unlucky\nto win a point. A good game from\nGary Koh here. The C team\nwere beaten. So were the ladies\nteam. You can't really make up a team of five ladies when only one\ngirl has been all term!\nAs a bonus to all you silly-prone people, there is a multi-prize bowling session today. Win\ncans of coke, Mars bars etc for\ndoing just about anything and\nhave a good chance of winning a bottle of something rather\naloch oli c. HOCKEY\nCup win\nIC moved into the second round\nof the cup aware that, although,\nRCS were undoubtedly the\nunderdogs, they were not going\nto be brushed aside easily. The\nop posit on s tactics were obvious\nfrom the start, and the use of the\npacked defence may well have\nworked if Smith and Luffkin\nhadn't contrived well to score\ntwo short corners early in the\nfirst half. This forced RCS to\nattack and both sides squandered chances as IC tried\nto put the game beyond RCS's reach. The second half saw IC\ndominating the midfield and\npushing up hard in order to\nincrease their lead. However the\nRCS defence held firm with\nMcGillivary and Parker finding\nthe sweeper, keeper or\nnarrowness of the goal difficult to\novercome.\nSo the game ended with IC\nhappy with their two-nil victory\nbut reflecting on the fact that to\nprogress much further they will\nhave to start scoring a few more\nof the easier chances.\n18 Wednesday 12 December 1984 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "CREATURE\nFELIX35 years This issue commemorates 35 years of FELIX. Staff member\nGrenville Manuel takes a look back at the birth, childhood,\nadolescence and maturity of the newspaper of Imperial College\nUnion.\nThe need has been felt for some\ntime for a frequently published\njournal to comment upon the\naffairs of the College whilst they\nare still topical, and to bring to the\nattention of its members the\nactivities of Clubs and Societies\nof which people at present know\nlittle, and knowing little care even\nless.\nThus began the first paragraph of\nthe first issue of FELIX,- who was 35\nyears old on Sunday.\nThe first issue was primitive by\ntoday's standards, thin and contained\nlittle that would be of relevance to\ntoday's student (rather like\nBroadsheet is today). The first editor\nwas EM Hughes, and it cost 3d. However, students in 1949 did\nshare some pursuits with their\nmodern counterparts. The first\neditor tried to emphasise the good\nvalue of FELTX by stating that a term's subscription cost less than a pint of beer.\nMost of the cover stories in the\nearly issues are about student arrest\nafter various pranks: two students\nwho scaled the Albert Memorial\nbeing fined a whole shilling.\nStudents in 1950 must have been\nrelatively prosperous, as Issue\nEleven started a series of road tests\nwith the Morris Cowley. The\nmotoring correspond ant especially\nliked a hand operated klaxon, which\n'commanded respect even from the\nold ladies of Kensington'.\nSome of the early issue did have a delightful 'Olde Worlde' feel, with\nheadlines such as 'Rummy Doings at\nthe University'. One 1950 cover\nstory concerned the disgraceful\nsacking of Mr Sellers , the Union\nDining Hall butler in a cost cutting\nexercise. This was roundly attacked,\nas Mr Sellers 'provided one of the\ndifferences between Imperial\nCollege and other less august\ncolleges'.\nBy 1957 the circulation had risen\nfrom the inti al600 to 1400, and the\nquality of production was improving\nsteadily. A May issue carried a special rag supplement with stories\nof a fake zebra crossing erected by\nstudents which was accepted as\ngenuine by traffic and pedestrians\nalike, and a brawl which had to be\nbroken up by 'policemen with\nwaterproof underclothing', though\nhow this fact was ascertained was\nnot clear.\nBy 1961 the price had risen to 4d, and FELIX was becoming closer to\nthe superb and vibrant publication it\nis today. Headlines included 'You\nAnd Your Grant', 'Union Meeting\nInquorate' and 'Increased Refectory\nCharges'. FELIX was being printed\non better quality paper, with\nphotographs (the first breasts\nDONOVAN\nWILL PLAY\nAlbert Hall Concert Saved\nPhoto courtesy Pye Records Ltd.\nown rie ht and recently set the\nfn lk world on its head with their\n\"Layers of the Onion\" LP.\nTvrannosaurus Rex. plugged like\ncrazy in John feel'sr jeff um cd(i arden column in International\nTimes are rumoured to he the\n\" new thine\" group, turned down\nby record inc com nani es for being\ntoo \" un commercial\" and \" pro- .\nr tress 'vc \" It should make an interesting act.\nAltoffiher, what a knockout\nshow!

Far from it,\nhaving continually lost votes at\nIC UG Ms Michael has now taken\nhis fight out of College. The first\nstep was his approach to the\nnational papers last year which\nresulted in an article in the Daily\nExpress, after which he claimed\nto have been threatened with\nexpulsion from the College by the\nRector. Now he has written to\nevery student union president in\nthe country to stir up trouble,\nresulting in the motion at U LUG UC last week. However, not all\nanti-porn campaigners in College\nagree with his tactics. FELIX staff were disturbed from their\nlabours last Wednesday by the\nsound of Newperson himself\nbeing verbally savaged by a member of WIST under Beit\nArch.

It has not yet been\nrevealed whether or not the\nCollege paid them, but it is clear\nthere is no chance of recovering\nthe considerable costs involved in\nironing out the problems from\nthe now demised company.\nPossibly a shake-up in the old\nboy network by which Estates are\nsaid to invite tenders for such\ncontracts is in order after this\nlatest debacle.\nEXTRAORDINARY meeting\nof the College BIOTECHNOLOGY SOCIETY FRIDAY14 DECEMBER,1.00 pm, ROOM702, BIOC HEMIS TRY BUILDING.

The parasite is a Cyclophyllid\nCestode, ie a tapeworm, and is therefore a flat\nworm and not a round worm as stated in the\narticle. The adult worm Taenia so liu m causes\nTaeniosis in man, which is only mildly\npathogenic. A complication of this disease is\nCysticercosis and this can be fatal. The two\nforms of the disease are due entirely to low\nstandards of human hygiene and cannot be\nblamed on the dear old pig!\nFurthermore, it was stated that Taenia\nso liu m causes ades ease called Trichinosis. In\nfact, Trichinosis is caused by a Trichurid\nNematode, Trichinella spiral is which is a round worm. This can also be found in pork\nbut is easily destroyed by adequate cooking.\nWe would like to point out that due to\nexceptionally high standards of meat\ninspection in the UK, these parasites are\nextremely rare.\nYours sincerely,\nDeborah Bailey, Sally Power, E Bell\nCP Careford, Nicholas Renn, Mark Viney\nMolly on the mend\n\u2022\u2022 .\nDear Sir,\nI wish to express my thanks to all the\npeople that helped me when I had my\naccident, many thanks also to all the people\nthat sent get well cards and messages.\nI am at last on the mend again.\nMerry Xmas and Happy New Year to all.\nMolly,\nSouthside Shop\nMaxwell's demon\nDear Sir,\nI would like to congratulate Mr Nick\nMaxwell on his election to the post of Vice\nChairman of Wellsoc.

Many of\nyou are already taking advantage\nof this. In order to get more\nmoney during the vacation, all\nyou have to do is write to the\nhousing benefit section which\nyou are already dealing with, tell\nthem that you are paying rent\nover the vacation and that you\nwant your claim to be re-assessed. In most cases you will\nget around 70% of your rent back\nin this way.\nIf you have not already claimed\nthen you can either sign on as\nunemployed in which case you\nwill get certificated housing\nbenefit through the DHS S. Alternatively you can submit a claim for standard housing\nbenefit.\nThe DHSS option involves\nsigning on in London as and\nwhen required so it is probably\neasiest to go for standard\nhousing benefit which can all be\ndone by post.\nSupplementary Benefit\nIf you are not getting a grant you\ncan sign on for supplementary\nbenefit so long as you are\nunemployed and available for\nwork. This is worth around \u00a326\nper week.\nUnemployment Benefit\nTo be eligible for unemployment\nbenefit, during the Christmas\nvacation you need to have\nworked and paid National\nInsurance Contributions during\nthe relevant period. In effect you\nneed to have earned over \u00a31350\nbetween April 1981 and April\n1982 or over \u00a31475 between April\n1982 and April 1983.\nNB Overseas students, that is\nnon-EEC students are not\neligible for these benefits.\nFurthermore it can cause\nserious problems if you try to\nclaim them.\nIf you would like to find out more\nabout any of these benefits and\nhow to go about claiming them,\nplease call into Student Services\n15 Princes Gardens.\nStudent Services will be closed\nfrom 17 December to 1 January\ninclusive.\nfELIX U Cadbury\nw \u20ac F Schweppes\nGraduate Opportunities\nwith Cadbury Schweppes\nWednesday 12 December\nThe Ante-Room 6.00pm Sherfield Building\nThe inside view'\nAn opportunity to learn more\nabout this multi-national\norganisation, and to discuss career\nopportunities with directors and\nyoung managers.\nBuffet food and drink\nprovided\nPlease note:\nULU Travel (STA)\nin the JCR\nPhone number is 581 8882\nnot as advertised in\nprevious issues\nBuzz Off\nFor Christmas\nLOW COST FLIGHTS WORLDWIDE..

Within two days I'd bought it. What can you say?\nWell, if you've ever enjoyed\nyourself you'll love this. At IC\nRadio, everyone, from the\nclassical show presenter, to\nthe heavy metal DJ say it's great. So do I. Fraggles: All Around The\nWorld\nA couple of months ago, did\nyou get as pissed off as I did\nwith idiots putting on Fraggle\nvoices! I hope this is a flop just so they don't all start again.\nHaving just listened to the\nToy Dolls I can find absolutely\nnothing I like about this one.\nAnother song, with nothing\nlyrics, nothing tune and\nnothing appeal.\nLou Read: l Love You Suranne\nStarts like a Trio song but\nsoon breaks into an American\nfunky rock song with a god\nawful clapping machine in the\nbackground. As a rule I don't like American rock. This is no\nexception. The flip, 'Vicious',\nis produced by Dave Bowie,\nbut seems like a failed Stones\n.take off. Forget it, Lou,\nwhatever you do I prefer the\nToy Dolls!\nMeat loaf: Nowhere Fast\nThe follow-up to 'Modern\nGirl' is also from the highly\nsuccessful album' Bad Attitude'. Mr Loaf has at last\ngot back the excitement of\n'Bat Out Of Hell' and with\n'Nowhere Fast' I think he'll\nregain his rightful place at the\ntop of the rock world.\nStevie Wonder: Love Light In\nFlight\nBelieve it or not (and you\nprobably won't!) Stevie actually asked me if I thought\nthis would make a good\nsingle. I said yes (well what\nelse do you say to a mega star?) but now I'm not so\nsure. A good quality sound,\nexcellent production, but I'm afraid it does nothing for me.\nPerhaps that's just 'cause I love his ballads. I 'll tell him\nnext time!!\nKenny & Dolly: Christmas\nWithout You\nI bet this gets played all the\ntime on Radio Two. Apparently it's from the new 'Once\nUpon a Christmas' album.

Which is a shame for\nthose who missed this their\nlatest offering, the third\nproduction this season.\nPythagoras is a light-hearted comedy with a though ful message. Set in a mental hospital, the play\nderives its humour mainly\nform the antics of the patients.\nWhilst normally such a subject could be considered\nrisque, it's all done in the best\npossible taste.\nJohn Burgess is well cast as\nthe mega loman ical Pythagoras. Convinced he is the\nreincarnation of the Greek\nmathematician he is able to\ncause thunder and lightening,\nmake the phone ring at will, do\ndifficult calculations in his\nhead and generally walk on\nwater. When cured and back\nto sanity he loses these\nabilities and his self confidence. With the other\nparts, whilst one or two of the\ncharacters were either slightly\nunconvincing or a bit over\nplayed, on the whole the\nstandard of acting was\ncommendably high.\nThursday night, Coronet\nStreet in the basement of a converted warehouse, an old\nman with sunken eyes and\nlong flowing beard moves up\nto the stage microphone\namidst whistles and applause\nfor a handful of hard-bopper s, now settling themselves in the\nbar. 'Tell all your friends about us', he cries. 'Running a club;\nwell its no trip, but its a groove'. The band is the\nintensely powerful Weller\nSpring Quartet. The MC is\nPeter Ind, one time session\nCoronet St\nHoxton Sq.\nLondon N1\nOid st e Tel O!7292476/2440 DECEMBER DATES\n12 Blue Note Revisited: Ray\nWarleigh and Chris Pyne\n13 Stan Robinson Quintet\nwith John Taylor\n16 Pete King/Henry Lowther\nQuintet\n19 Pat Crumley Sextet with\nGuy Barker\n20 Henry Lowther/Pete\nBeachill Quintet\n23 Don Weller/Bryan Spring\nQuartet\n30 Duncan Lamont/Kenny\nWheeler Quintet\nmusician for Bird and Davis,\nnow co-director of Wave\nRecording Studios, below\nwhich his club, the Bass Clef,\nis based.\nAlthough open for just three\nmonths, Mr Ind has already\nmade the Clef a name to\nremember, alongside Ronnies\nand the 100 Club, as a place to\nfind serious music of all types\nin the jazz spectrum. With an\nenormous backup of artists to\ncall on, it can provide live\nmusic, lunchtime and evening, six days a week.\nThursday's offering of hard-bop clinched it. Friday night\ncame early; Weller, tight-as a kettle drum, lau ched some\nterrific riffs on occasions,\nconstantly nagged, as ever by\nhypnotically precise rhythm\nwork from Brian Spring. Errol\nClark, all too often too quiet to\nbe heard, is a terrific pianist,\nand the intimate atmosphere\nwas well suited to giving him a fair hearing. The syncopation\nhas shifted from Spring to\nWeller since I last saw them\ntwo years ago, but they're still\nred hot and razor sharp.\nIn the recording studio\nabove the club, I talked to Ind\nmore closely about his new\nventures. Having spent much\nof his life in New York and the\nStates, he was well aware of\nthe lack of proper jazz-venture\nin London. Stateside clubs\nback round the\nBASS never seem to close; they're\nalways ticking over, always\nbusy. Since the demise of the\ndance halls in the forties and\nfifties, however, jazz over here\nhas revolved around the 'jazz-pub'. Beer, skittles and blues,\nbut at the patron's discretion\nand subject to normal licensing hours. Some pubs\nhave tried to overcome the\nproblem, (the Bull and Gate in\nKentish Town uses its large\nsnooker hall and stage to seat\n400 people) but with no base\nto rehearse and work from,\nmany musicians find con-stan ty 'touring London' hard\nwhilst many others never see\nthe light of day.\nMany jazz enthusiasts think\nthat the few late-night clubs\nthat do exist in the capital\nhave a monopoly on the\nscene. Ronnie Scotts, the hub\nof London's jazz club network\nis exorbitantly expensive,\nattracting an elite of wealthy\nposers, with little interest in\nhard jazz. But Ind defends\nRonnies, ('He helped me open\nthis place'). The acts Scott\nbrings over from the States\nhave to be paid for, air fare and\nall. So artists play at Ronnies\nfor weeks, not nights and get\nto know the place before\ngoing home. How does Peter\nInd expect to do the same?\nAmerican jazz-players have\nrecorded at Wave for a long\ntime now, (most recently\nguitarist, Buddy de Franco\nlaying down a new LP called\n'A Chip off the Old Blop').\nOther mu sci an s he can catch\non tour or from the national\nfestivals. 'Of course, its early\ndays yet', but Ind has many\ncontacts. And for clubs who\nhave no studios or capital or\ncontacts? 'Well, its no trip but\nits a groove'.\nFELIX Wednesday 12 December 1984 15\n\n"

    "content": "\u2022 T IT ERS: OUR\nThe one we\nhad to print\nDear Sir,\nHaving undergone the difficult transfer\nfrom Imperial College undergraduate life to\nOxford graduate work I am shocked to find\nthat Oxford University does not have a centrally produced newspaper like your 'fine\nFELIX' to brighten-up each week. So the\nmessage to Freshers and all at IC is count\nyour blessings and may FELIX never die.\nIC Graduate\nBible no match\nDear Sir,\nHaving read Mr Sheriffs article in last week's FELIX, about the eating of pork and its\nbiochemistry, I would like to make a few\npoints. He showed in this article a very\ncursory knowledge of the Bible, and with a few 'swipes' tried to make a mockery of it and\nthose who believe it.\nFor the benefit of those readers who read\nthe article for its interesting biochemical\ninformation, and those who are not very well\nacquainted with the Bible, it must be pointed\nout that the commands prohibiting the eating\nof unclean animals were referred to, in the\narticle, totally out of context with the rest of\nthe Bible. A brief look through the New\nTestament, and even parts of the Old\nTestament show that some of these hygiene\nand ceremonial laws were just for a time, and\nwith a specific reason behind them.\nI would also like to correct one other point.\nThe quotation 'It is not what goes into a person which defiles them, but what comes\nout of their heart' was what Jesus himself said\n(Mark Ch 7), not the Patriarch of\nConstantinople as stated.\nObviously here is not the place to go into\ndetails but let me ask you a question. Do not\nmost parents tell their young children never\nto touch matches? Now who would then\nexpect them never to use matches when they\nare grown up?\nThis is not an explaining away of the Bible,\nbut putting these things in their proper\ncontext.\nYours faithfully,\nDave Linkens\nAero 3\nCottle pays up\nDear Sir,\nI Must correct at least one inaccuracy in\nthe letter about the Carnival which appeared\nin the last FELIX. The majority of the people who were\nworking on Guildsheet on Sunday morning\ndid indeed vanish in the direction of Beit to\nclean up the building. Late as this may have\nbeen it seems that many of the problems were\ndue to a lack communication on the part of\nEnts people.\nI resent the vicious way this letter tries to\nattack everyone at once \u2014 including\nGuildsheet which has nothing to do with it\nanyway, I even paid to get in!\nMark Cottle (Guildsheet Editor)\nPork\nscratching s Dear Sir,\nWe write in reply to the article in last\nweek's FELIX(30 November) by T Sherriff\nregarding pork and religion. Whilst\ncommending his research into the\nbiochemistry of pork we would like to correct\nsome misinterpretation of Christian\nteaching. Firstly his idea that the 'coming of\nthe Gospel cleansed all things' is incorrect.\nJesus didn't come to cleanse 'things', he come\nto break the power of sin and death and to\noffer a new life to those who would accept it.\nThis new life releases us from being judged\nunder the Law of the Old Testament. All that\nJesus requires is that you 'love the Lord your\nGod with all your soul and with all your\nmind' and to 'Love your neighbour as\nyourself. All the Law and the Prophets hang\non these two commandments' (Deuteronomy\n6 v5; Levitious 19 vl8 and Matthew 22 v3740). Jesus is more concerned with what we are\nlike inside than outside, and said 'What goes\ninto a man's mouth does not make him\nunclean, but what comes out of his mouth,\nthat is what makes him unclean '(Matthew 15\nv lO \u2014 not the Patriarch of Constantinople as\nsuggested!) It is not a question of religious\nobservance rather it is the living out of a transformed life. The comment by T Sherriff\nthat there is 'no evidence' that people have\nallowed this to change their lives is not\nsupported by our personal experience or by\nthe lives of our Christian friends.\nPerhaps it would be a challenge to anyone\nwho does not know that is for themselves to\nread the true teachings of Jesus recorded in\nthe Gospel accounts in the Bible, or to meet\nwith a Christian friends. It will change your\nlife!\nYours sincerely,\nSteven Burgess (Civ Eng 2)\nRichard McCallum (Physics 2)\nSnivel's seasonal\nsnipes\nDear Sir,\nSo glad to be behind the pen again, many\nthanks to Roger Preece for a great letter, it's a pity God Himself couldn't have written a line\nor two as well, but I know how it is...busy\nguy. Still more astute letter I thought\nespecially the opening lines, I liked that bit. I certainly don't need any friends with enemies\nlike you.\nWell this week I must relate a most\namusing experience at one of the m nay social\ngatherings held at the J CR, much akin to\nsticking your head in a bucket of hyaena offal,\nbut much noisier. Out for nothing more than\na little dancing, a friend and myself\napproached the dance floor with intrepid\ndelight. Adjusting to the vibrant discords\nthat prevail at such events, I motioned my\nway over to a young lady, dancing on her\nown, to invite her to dance. I say young lady\nbecause this was the app ern ace she gave me at\nthe time. On reflection I should say that she\ncould well have been young. Anyway to\ncontinue, I sidled up to her and asked her\npolitely, 'Would you like to dance?' to which\nshe replied, 'I'm dancing already!' Had I my\nwits about me I might have replied 'Well you\ncould have fooled me,' but as the\ncircumstances were I stood back aghast and\nin all honesty quite amused. Unfortunately\nshe had no intention to amuse. I said 'Well\nwhat sort of an answer is that?' to which she\nlooked at me blankly, unaccustomed to\npunters pursuing any further. I retorted\n'That's not very nice is it?' and with this broke\nthe ice just a little. With uns poe n consent we\nst rated to dance. I say 'to dance' to give you\nthe idea, but to say we were dancing would be\nexaggerating a little. This girl wasn't about to\nwaste any energy on me. Dissipating about\ntwo calories an hour it would not be unfair to\ndescribe this girl as death warmed up. (I hope\nshe wasn't offended.) Shovelling one foot out\nin front of the other was as much as she could\nmanage and with the odd twitch of a limp\nwrist I was not impressed by this newly\nacquired partner and sought means to get rid\nof her. Not to be beaten by T must go to the\nloo' or the subtle approach 'Piss Off. My boyfriend's coming back' I injected 'Thanks,\nI must dash. I 've got a dental appointment' to\nwhich she replied 'What time is it?' She\nprobably told her friends 'He has really bad\nteeth'.\nNo doubt I'm now going to be inundated\nwith hate mail from every pot-smoking,\nbean-eating, lesbian, C ND supporter in the\nCollege...God forbid.\nYours equivocally,\nEverard Snivel\n\n"

The start of\nthe first race saw the pink team\ntake command and finish\nconvincing winners against City.\nThe second race was equally\none-sided although one of the\nCity helms was allowed to lead\nthe way around a very tricky\ncourse while Imperial cruised\nhome second, third and fourth.\nThe green team raced UL2 in a much closer match. The\noutcome was finally decided by a multi boat collision, during which\nAoe smashed up yet another\nrudder. UL2 were extremely\nlucky to emerge un-sca the d from\nthe melee and scored a very\nundeserved victory. Further\nracing was at temped, but the\nstarting officials boat developed\nsub-aqua ten dances and, as the\nformer were not equip ed with\nsnorkels, racing was abandoned.\nBADMINTON\nIndividual\nU AU Badminton individual\nChampionships 1984, played at\nNottingham University 23-25\nNovember.\nFriday at 5pm saw the arrival\nof the squad in Nottingham. The\nsquad consisted of five Post\nGrads (Mike Bradley, Steve\nWillis, Chris Gaukroger, Alan\nPither, Janet Folkes) and two\nfresher s( Susan Yates and Julie\nGoodeve). First on the agenda\nwas a raid on Sainsburys,\nfollowed by reporting in at Nott\nUniv Sports Centre for the\nsingles matches.\nIn the men's singles, Mike and\nAlan were knocked out in their\nfirst match, whilst Steve survived\none round, only to lose to the No\n2 seed in the next; who\neventually won the final.\nIn the ladies singles, Janet lost\nher first match as did Julie (to the\nNo 2 seed), but Susan won one\nmatch, which gave her the\ndubious honour of returning for\n9am on Saturday when she\npromptly lost her second match.\nIn mixed doubles both Mike\nand Susan, and Julie and Chris\nhad hard fought games \u2014 both\npairs eventually losing in three\ngames. Steve and Janet fared the\nbest of all \u2014 they won three\nmatches, which enabled them to\nreach the quarter finals, where\nthey finally lost to a pair from\nLoughborough.\nThe mens doubles saw IC's second appearance in a quarter\nfinal, this time from Steve and\nMike, where they were unlucky\nto lose a very close game. Our\nother mens doubles pair (Chris\nand Alan) got knocked out in\ntheir first match.\nOur only entry in the ladies\ndoubles was Susan and Julie,\nand they played some hard\nfought games \u2014 both pairs\neventually losing in three games.\nSteve and Janet fared the best of\nall \u2014 they won three matches,\nwhich enabled them to reach the\nquarter finals, where they finally\nlost to a pair from Loughborough.\nThe mens doubles saw IC's second appearance in a quarter\nfinal, this time form Steve and\nMike, where they were unlucky\nto lost a very close game. Our\nother mens doubles pair (Chris\nand Alan) knock ered out in their\nfirst match.\nOur only entry in the ladies\ndoubles was Susan and Julie,\nand they played some hard\nmatches, enabling them to reach\nthe quarter-finals, where they\nlost to No 2 seeds from Warwick.\nAltogether our first appearance in the U AU badminton\ntournament was well worth while\nwith three pairs reaching quarter\nfinals.\nVOLLEYBALL\nUAU\ntriumph\nIC Mens Volleyball team are on the\nway to a repeat of last year's win in\nthe University Athletic's Union\nChampionships coming out top in\nthe South-East regional competition\nheld at Essex University,\nColchester, last Saturday. After\nconvincingly beating East Anglia ,\nSurrey and Sussex Universities, IC,\nas expected, found themselves up\nagainst old rivals Kent. The first set\nof this match resulted in an anti-climatic 15-2 victory for Imperial \u2014\nthe very first IC attacking move\nshowed the way with Pete 'Finger'\nWalker setting a beautiful short ball\nfor Christos to spike down in a metre inside Kent's attack zone.\nThe second set was closer, with IC\nrelaxing a bit, but with hard work\nfrom Steve and Dom on the long\nball, Al blasting everything remotely\nlike a half ball and Stef pounding the\nodd half-behind with glee the result\nwas a foregone conclusion, the\nscore 15-11 for us. Unfortunately\nMike didn't have a second chance\nto try his new attacking jump-dig as\nhe was on the subs bench with\nyours truly providing moral\nsupport.\nCongratulations also to the\nLadies team which played on\nSunday \u2014 they won for the first\ntime ever, a convincing victory over\nthe girls of Brunei University. We\nhope this is just the beginning, as the\npotential and the en thus iam exists\nin plenty!\nUnfortunately, things started to\ngo to pieces after that good start\nand we lost to Kent and Sussex,\nwith the digs letting us down a bit \u2014\nthough some good blocks and\ncovering helped, and the serving\nwas marvellous at times, more\ncommunications would have\nhelped, though this could be difficult\nin a team of two Greeks, an Irani, a German, a Czech, a Scot and the\ntoken minority Englishwoman \u2014\nCaptain Viv Not to miss out the\nIrish coach! Well done all round.\nA quick mention for the lads of\nthe men's second team who\nunfortunately lost to Shoreditch last\nweek.

However\nundaunted by this fact we were\ndetermined to set new 3rd XI\nrecords, and we suceeded. The\nrecords created were:-a Largest squad of the season\n(13 players).\nb Most short corners conceded in a half (app or ox12 in\nfirst half).\nc Least number of shorts\nconverted into goals (none),\nd Longest throw of a hockey\nstick, thanks to Mark cubitt.\nc Most goals scored by a goalie\n(well done Chris Jones),\nf Greatest number of goals\nscored by opposition (five).\nFinally we also managed to\nmaintain our 100% home record.\nSPORTD\nLADIES CRICKET\nEnd of\nterm\nFor the last six weeks the men's cricket team has had company in\nthe nets at Lord's Indoor Cricket\nSchool.

In truth the victories\nshould have been by larger\nmargins, but victories they were\nnonetheless. Against the\nWeavers Pete was crap (what's new), Buz and Alan were\nprobably the best players\nalthough Alan's nine and eleven\nsomewhat blemished his\nperformance. Against the\nPalmerston Ian (our glorious\nleader) was drinking slime line BITTER LEMON, and JAZ, who\nwas on Penicillin (possibly due to\na nocturnal transgression) drank\nORANGE SQUASH. Both\nchanged to bitter (what men!)\nduring the evening, but the initial\nimpact caused untold consternation amongst our team of\nhardened alcoholics. Pete was\nsurprisingly put in at number two\nand played almost com patently although still scoring a seven and\na five. Ians' sobriety allowed his\nbest performance of the season\nwith Buz and Richard playing\nwell again.

IC scored their\nfirst goal very early on and\nproved to be the faster of the two\nteams. Southampton never\nreally showed any cohesion and\nCollege won easily. After\nhuddling for an Ian Spooner\nteam talk IC next played Surrey.\nCollege scored from a number of\nwell drilled set moves. Three\nSurrey shots unfortunately\nwhizzed past IC's goalie Dave\n'the' Wall. Robert, playing 'man\nin the hole', twice turned his\ndefender to score a couple of\ngood goals. Tight marking was\nneeded to contain Surrey and IC\nwent on to win the game. Against\nBath a practiced 'man up' drill did\nnot work. This was an ominous\nsign for the forthcoming game\nagainst Bristol. Bath however\nwere dismissed for nothing after\nCollege scored seven times. The\nlast game against Bristol was the\ndecisive one. College were\nplaying in white for the first time\nand, out of turn, Bristol scored\nfirst. The game was fast and the\nhurried atmosphere meant a few\nopportunites were missed IC's man up drills did not work,\nhowever college did have many\ngood shots on target. Bristol\nthough, with the help of their\ngoalie, won 6-3. Imperial College,\nnow as the runners up in the\nSouthern league, go through to a further semi-final round in\nJanuary.

The motion was proposed\nby UL U executive and Michael\nNewman, a former student at\nfm peri al College spoke on their\nbehalf. Ian Bull as ICU President\nopposed the motion as it\ncontradicted ICU policy. After\nseveral minor alterations the\nmotion was passed by a substantial majority. The UL U executive were mandated to\norganise and publicise a picket of\nHon Porn Night.\nThe two motions proposed at\nlast week'sU GM were both\npassed. The first concerned\nstudent grants and was proposed\nby Mike Young Chairman of IC\nSDP Society. This gained a Grants\nclimb down\nParents of students in higher\neducation will not have to pay\ntuition fees in the next academic\nyear following changes in the\ngovernment's proposals for\neducation spending. The changes\nare seen as a partial climb-down\nfor the Education Secretary, Sir\nKeith Joseph and they arose\nfollowing threats of a major Tory\nback bench revolt. Coupled to the\nchanges will be consideration of a 'radical change in the student\nsupport system' including the\npos sibi l ty of a loans system.\nThe major victim of the\nconcessions is the Science budget\nwhich will be cut by \u00a39 million to\npay for some of the \u00a321 million\ncost of the changes. Of the\nremaining\u00a312m needed, \u00a32m will\ncome from educational research,\nadult education and the micro-election ics programme , and \u00a310\nmillion form the Treasury. It\nseems as though funds to support\nthe College will be reduced but is\nis not yet know by how much nor\nwhat effects the cuts will have.\nMr Phil Woolas, president of\nthe National Union of Students\nFELIX\nsubstantial majority and Ian\nBull, ICU President, urged\neveryone who had voted for the\nmotion to send letters to their\nMPs.\nThe second motion on\nFreedom of Choice was\nproposed by Tim Williams of\nR SMU. This sought to alter a previous motion passed last year.\nAn amendment was proposed by\nRosemary Dickin to change the\nmotion to prevent use of ICU rooms for pornographic events.\nTim Williams spoke against the\namendment which was defeated\nby 57 votes.\nThe main motion was opposed\nby Roger Preece who claimed\nthat pornographic events would\nbe detrimental to the College in\nthe eyes of the public. A procedure motion was put to\nvote on the issue and the motion\non Freedom of Choice was\npassed by a narrow majority.\n(NUS) has described the changes\nas a 'half baked with drawl' reiterating that at least 180 000\nfamilies will have to pay more to\nsupport students and there will\nbe no guarantee that students will\nreceive their full parental\ncontributions. He claims the\nchanges will only help well off\nfamilies.\nMr Ian Bull, ICU President,\nwelcomed the changes. He hoped\nthat further concessions could be\nobtained after a consistent\ncampaign of letter writing and\nother peaceful protests. He also\nintended to ask the Rector to\nspeak out on behalf of students.\nEclipse of\nthe Mooney\nMr Victor Mooney, Refectory\nManager is to retire on May 31\nnext year after 31 years at IC. He\nwill be succeeded by Mr RF Northey who is currently\ncatering and bars manager for\nthe London Borough of\nWaltham Forest. Mr Northey\nwill join the College in March\n1985 and will take over full\nresponsibility as Refectory\nManager when Mr Mooney\nretires.\nImperial College Union Finance Committee (UFC) has\nnow agreed this years estimates\nfor Constituent College Unions\n( CU Us) and major subcommittees which oversee social,\nrecreational, cultural and athletic\nclubs and the Union public-at ions. There will be a3% cut or a return to last year's level of\nspending, whichever is greater,\nfor all major sub-committees and\nin add it on the equipment funds\nof both Publications Board and\nUFC are to be cut by \u00a3 1000. The\nCampaigns Fund has been\nreduced by \u00a3100. C CU incomes\nhave not been directly cut\nhowever the \u00a3750 profit expected\nform the Bookshop has not\nmaterialise d and this will not be\nmade up by ICU:\nJuggling for Ethiopia\nA ten hour 'Juggle-bus k' last week raised \u00a3103.39 in aid of the\nEthiopian Famine Appeal. The four person team mainly from the\nEngineering Geology Department were joined by seven other\njugglers and two musicians during the day and they are thinking of\nstarting a club next term.\nThe sponsored fast in aid of Oxfam raised \u00a3426. Five people\nfrom the Third World first society took only water for a period of\n48 hours and they all successfully completed the fast.\nWednesday 12 December 1984 3\n\n"
