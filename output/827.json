    "content": "Letters\nEvelyn Merger\nDear Bill,\nThe proposal to merge Willis Jackson and Hol be in Houses, it has been suge s ted could\nbe accomplished before the start of the next\nacademic year. The benefits of this would be\nthe conversion of one of the warden's flats and\nthe possible conversion of a sub warden's flat\ninto student accommodation. The cost of these\nimprovements, providing 3 to 5 places, would obviously be quite large and would have to\nbe met by the already over strained Residences\naccount. The merger would result in a deterioration in social life, quite apart from the\nfinancial considerations. At present there is a marked difference between the social life in the three smaller Evelyn Garden Houses, and\nthe sterility and isolation apparent in Southwell and Fisher Halls.\nIt has been argued that few of the students\nin Willis Jackson gave preference to this house\non application forms. This to some extent also\ntrue of other Evelyn Garden houses, because\nof their isolation from college, but the vast\nmajority of the present residents would not\nnow wish to move. It seems ridiculous that\nthe opinions of people who, at that point had not even seen the house or attended college,\nare put forward as a reason for the merger.\nThere is very little ent haus i as m amongst the\nstudents at either House for these plans, and the House Committee at Willis Jackson has\nresolved to fight them. We hope the college\ncan find other ways to resolve it sacco mod ation crisis.\nRupert Clayton\nNicholas Marley\n(10 other students)\nUGM\nDear Bill,\nI attended the U GM last week for the first\ntime for a while, and was not surprised to find\nthat the usual tricks of putting the interesting\nbusiness last were still going on. When this\noccurs, to help along business often before\nquorum is called, I do not object, but there was\nonly one issue in which two-thirds of those\npresent were interested. Business was spun out for an hour before the motion on U GM abolition was discussed, and sufficiently long\nfor people with2.30 lectures to have to leave\nbefore voting was completed. The audience\nwas considerably reduced before this occured.\nA number of appeals from the front of the\nmeeting were made, to give serious consideration to separate parts of the motion\nconcerning the merger with St Mary's. It did indeed deserve better treatment than it\nreceived, but the majority of the audience was\nfaced with the choice of a vote now or never,\nit was voted down entirely. Given the way in which the meeting is handled, it was impossible to produce any useful decisions\nfrom any point within the motion, except that\nU GM abolition was not acceptable.\nAttending aUG M to vote on an issue I feel\nstrongly about, is virtually the only time that\nI have contact with the workings of the Union. Iam not surprised that all other students with who mI have discussed this motion, have\nagreed that U GM abolition is un ace p table. The\none point of the college organisation which has impressed me while being a student here\nds the openness of the system to the electorate\nto compel the wishes upon a disinterested\nExecutive, or to curb its excesses. This has\nalways seemed a sharp contrast to elections\noutside college.\nDavid Pierce \u2022'' : .\nPhysics PG\nSupport\nDear Bill,\nIn the Alternative Prospectus Update published\nat the end of last term, the Sub-Editorial stated\nthat the Undergraduate Studies Committee, 'do\nnot receive as much support as is necessary to\nreally gets things done'.\nAt the Committee's last meeting we discussed\nthis statement with the Sub-Editor, and I want\nto let everyone know, through your columns that\nthe Undergraduate Studies Committee has never\nbeen delayed in its work by lack of support from\nthe College, form the Union, from the AUT or\nfrom the board of studies. Indeed the support We\nhave received from all sources has/ been\nmagnificent.\nCollege has funded us generously. For\nexample, we could purchase a mark reader to\nprocess the teaching appraisal forms which\neveryone will be invited to complete-in the next\nfew days. It has also given us funds to meet all\nacademic staff training, and so to extend the\ntraining given to offered to probationary teachers\nso that they do a course in each of the\nprobationary years.\nThe support from college has also allowed us\nto institute the reviews of undergraduate teaching\nin departments, and by the end of this session\nmore than half the departments in college will\nhave been reviewed. In every case the report of\nthe review and the changes re cbr nm ended, have\nbeen accepted by the Board of Studies and by the\ndepartment concerned, without major\nam mend ment.; The Board of Studies have also supported us\nby accepting important new practices suggested\nin our reports. The most obvious will be the\navailability to all students, this year, of the\nresponses to the lecturing appraisal survey in\ntheir department. Other significant changes will\nfollow the acceptance of our report on Undergraduate Motivation and Performance\nearlier this session, which gave guidelines on\nstudent load, curriculum organisation and tutorial\npractice which can be monitored in our departmental reviews from now on.\nSupport from students has been positive,\nconstructive and energetic, both from the student\nmembers of the Committee, from Departmental\nRepresentatives and from students who have met\nthe assessors during departmental reviews.\nWe have been criticised for slowness, and there\nhave been times when we have consciously\nmoved slowly in order to give time for others to\naccept our point of view. But I think there have\nbeen significant achi ev ment s in our three and a half years of existence.\nYours David Blow Professor of Biophysics\n'Lefties'\nDear Bill,\nLast week's FELIX saw Ian Morris, Julian\nMoore and Neil Mc Clu sky corner the market\nin 'factual inaccuracies'. I would like to submit\nsome 'logical in ac cuar cie s' from their entries.\nRegarding the ridiculous Water Polo Loans\nposters, I quote Julian Moore, Tan Morris saw\nthe posters and agreed that they were totally\nillegal, but he isn't going to create a fuss\nbecause he agrees with the sentiments'. The\nquestion is not whether these posters met with\nclub committee's approval, but where the hell\nis the connection between water polo and student politics! Surely a society is given a budget AND an official Union name on the\nbasis that they will be used to further the\nstated aims of the society. The water polo club\nwas simply adopted as a tag to legit i mise the\npolitical activities of its committee.\nThe embryonic anti-student loans society\n(which now merits capital letters in Julian's letter and so seems to exist) should have set\nthemselves up and then acted. If they can get\nall those innocent students to sign their\npetition, then surely they could find twenty\nor thirty to form a society.\nAs someone who attended the first anti-loans meeting at college I would like to\ncontend his denial that they are not 'leftist\nhacks' - the whole room smelt of SW S S. They\nsucceeded in hijacking the water polo club,\nand then went on to hijack ICU for their own political ends.\nICU is unique. It has been well known for\nbeing apolitical - when Ken Baker visits most\nuniversities he gets pelted with eggs and yoghurt, when he visits IC he gets interviewed\nby STOIC. Many Lefties who come here\ncomplain at the apolitical nature of our Union they complain that its not fighting their\ncauses for them. I think most IC students are\ngenerally proud of our student Union and its\nindependant stance. There are signs of this\nbeing err oded the out of character adoption\nof the loans campaign may be the first\nexample.\nAndrew Allum Physics III\nWord of advice\nDear Bill,\nLast year Syd had the good sense to accept\nthe advice given by Nigel this year - namely\n'never write back' to letters in FELIX. Nick Bradshaw, ICU President 1976/77, imparted\nthese words of wisdom to his sucess or, Hugh Barrett, and urged me to pass them on to all\nfuture Presidents, saying that a sensible\nPresident has neither time nor inclination to\nindulge in distasteful slang ing matches in the\nmedia.\ni Perhaps it would be a good extension of the\nsame principle if past sabbaticals still at college\nalso refrained from replying to letters in FELIX. Sincerely,\nfen Hardy-Smith\nUnion Administrator\nPage 2 FELIX February 10 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nCreation v Darwin\nIntroduction\nMy sole purpose in writing this\narticle is to demonstrate that it is\nperfectly possible to hold a fundamentalist Christian faith and\nyet still be a rational scientist. I believe that the concept that there\nis a dichotomy between science and\nthe Bible and its claims is fallacious.\nA more correct idea is that held by\nthe ancient Greeks that science and\ntheology are but facets of\nphilosophy. This article will explore\nthree contentious areas: the origins\nof life, the philosophy of science and\nthe theology of science.\nThe origin of life\nChristians believe that salvation is\nby faith; why then do so many put\nso much energy into the creation/\nevolution debate which would seem\nto be somewhat irrelevant to the\ncentral doctrine of Christianity. The\nreason is that certain Christians\n(myself included) commonly labelled as fundamentalists believe\nthe Bible to be the inspired word of\nGod, the history and teaching of\nwhich is to be read as literal; this\nincludes the creation account in Genesis 1 and 2 which even upon\ncursory examination directly\ncontradicts evolutionary theories\ndeveloped since the time of Darwin.\nSo what are the scientific arguments behind creationism and evolution?\nFew would deny that evolution\nforms the backbone of modern\nbiology which, if broken, would\nhave a far more radical effect on biology than Einstein's views did on\nphysics. Despite only having the\nsomewhat elevated state of a theory,\nevolution is taught as a fact at all\nlevels of biology. It is assumed that\neveryone believes it and it is\nconsidered unscientific not to. Yet\nthe following scientists all believed\nin creation; JC Babbage, ] A Fleming, Lord Kelvin, J Lister, JC Maxwell, L Pasteur, Lord Rayleigh,\nG Stokes and M Faraday. To present\ntheory as fact is itself a gross\nscientific misconduct and yet can\neither evolution or creation ex nihilo\n(from nothing) be regarded scientifically as theory?\nScientific method requires\nobservations of a phenom one n to be\nmade followed by a hypothesis\nbeing formulated to explain these\nobservations. One then does\nexperiments to try and disprove the\nhypothesis. If, after much experimentation, you have not\ndisproved, it the hypothesis becomes a 'theory'. A universally\nnot disproven theory is often\nregarded as a law. Using this\nmethod creation ex nihilo and evolution can at best be regarded as\nvague notions, as unless one has\ntravelled in time, to observe these\nprocesses as they are supposed to\nincompleteness and creationists\nmaintain that it originates from\nNoah's flood.\nMolecular Biology\nThe similarity of basic protein\nstrut ure s in all species leads to the\nBishop Samuel Wilberforce\nhave occurred, one cannot conduct\nexperiments to test the accuracy of\none's ideas. Therefore scientifically\nboth theories depend on circumstantial evidence and conjecture, the basis of which can\nalways be disputed and yet never\nobjectively resolved. The concept of\nevolution is the spontaneous\noccurrence of mutations resulting in\nvariation between individuals which\nare selected by the environment to\nthe benefit of those individuals best\nadapted to it.\nCreation ex nihilo argues that God created the world from nothing as\nper the Genesis account and that\nscience purely observes what has\nbeen made.\nI shall now give more examples of\nequivocal evidence used by pro tag an is ts of the two theories\nbefore considering God and miracles.\nFossil Record\nEvolutionists cannot explain its\nconstruction of evolutionary trees.\nIt is equally pla usable that a rational\nGod would have a basic adaptable\nunit of design.\nAnthropology\nThe evidence for the decent of man\nis far from conclusive.\nAge of the Earth\nDepends on the method used.\nMeasurements on aluminium deposits give an estimate of 100\nyears!\nThe philosophy of science.\nIt was Aristotle who first put\nforward the concept of theology\nwhich states that all that can be\nobserved in the universe tends\ntowards its cause, ie God. This belief\nwas held in the early church. The\ninitiation of the dichotomy between\nscience and religion was caused by\nthe publication of Summa Theologiae and Summa Contra Gentiles\nby Dave\nThomas\nby St. Thomas of Aquinus in the\nthirteenth century. This argued for\nthe use of reason within faith and\nthis is the forerunner of modern\napologetics. In the f if fee en th century\nWilliam of Occum developed what\nis commonly called Occum's Razor\nPrinciple ie that the simplest\nhypothesis that accounts for the\nobserved data is probably the most\ncorrect. The birth of modern science\nwas in the sixteenth century with\nCopernicus' s Theory of the\nheliocentric universe and Bacon's development of modern scientific\nmethod with hypotheses being\nsubstantiated by observed data and\nnot by reason as had previously\nbeen the case. Does science have\nlimits within which it can operate?\nScience cannot explain where\nprecisely the universe came from\nhowever elaborate Big Bang theories\nmay become. Science cannot explain\nscientific law but can merely\nelucidate what it is from the\nphenomena observed. For example\nwhy are there positive, neutral and\nnegative electrical charges, why3 such charges and not four? Science\nis a consequence and not a cause of\nthe laws of creation that it observes.\nIt seeks to unify observed\nphenomena believing there to be an\nintegrity to creation and the whys\nmust be left to philosophy and theology. It is interesting to observe\nthat 'Das Kapital' by Marx was\npublished in 1848, 11 years prior to\n'The Origin of Species' by Darwin\nin 1859. Marx's famous one liner\nwas 'religion is the opium of the\npeople', and yet has communism\nbrought any greater happiness s to\nthe world than religion? TH Huxley\nand C Lyell, both fierce protagonists\nof Darwin's views, were sworn\natheists (Darwin became a Christian\njust before his death and realised\nthat God was behind creation). It\nmay be reasonably stated that the\nadoption of evolutionary theory by\nthe scientific community of the late\nnineteenth century was a deliberate\nattempt to free it from what it\nregarded as the shackles of the\nChurch. Since then evolution has\nbeen used to further the causes of\nMarxism and scientific humanism\nand to disprove God. The result of\nthis prevalence of science in society\ncan only lead to the conclusion that\n'science is the opium of the people'.\nYet to return to the principle of\nOccum's Razor evolutionists in their\nattempts to prove evolution beyond\ndoubt produce ever more complex\nand esoteric ideas which viewed by\n\"The Razor' seem ever less plausible\nPage 12 FELIX February 10 1989\n\n"

It will be held on Monday\nFebruary 6 at Lecture Theatre 213,\nHuxley Building at 12.40pm. For those familiar with the\nProfessor, they' ll be eagerly\nawaiting this event. But for those\nwho haven't heard of him, he is a Professor in Theoretical Physics and\nhe won the Nobel Prize for Physics\nin 1979. He is world-renowned and\nhas had a very interesting career.\nHe is usually not in Imperial\nCollege as he works in Trieste, Italy\nwhere he is the Director of the\nInternational Centre for Theoretical\nPhysics. So this is a golden\nopportunity not to be missed.\nPlease note that due to the\nextremely busy schedule of the\nProfessor, we might have to\nreschedule the talk to a later date.\nKeep a lookout for the posters.\nCROSS COUNTRY\n200 Line-Up\nCross Country Club Report\nThe IC Cross-Country team, easily\nthe strongest collegiate team in U.L., recently consolidated its\noverall fifth position in the London\nColleges League (which includes the\nPolys and 6th form Colleges) with\na solid fourth place at Trent Park.\nA field of nearly 200 lined up at\nthe start of the five mile race. The\nusual sprint start left most of us\ngasping immediately, with Frank\nDudbridge around 20th, Alex\nGaskell 25th, and Matt Lynas,\nStefan Ledin and Dave Knight all\nconserving their energy in the fifties.\nThe early frantic pace had settled by\nhalfway, by which time Frank had\nmoved through to 12th, and Matt,\nStefan and Dave were working their\nway through the forties. Alex had\nsuffered a recurrence of a hip injury,\nand to avoid further damage slowed\ndown to eventually finish 60th. The second half of a cross-country\nis usually a punishing slog, during\nwhich your motivation for this sport\nis severly questioned! However, a FILMSOC\nDolce Vita\nThis Thursday Filmsoc presents 'LP\nDolce Vita,' Fellini's erotic classic.\nMarcel Mastroianni and Anita\nEkberg gave excellent performances\nwhich, when coupled with Fellini's bizarre visual syle results in a movie\nthat still has the ability to shock\ntwenty nine years after its initial\nrelease in 1960. The film deals with\nthe prophetic vision of a generations\nspiritual and moral decay with\nMastroianni as a hack seeking\nsensational stories by bedding\nwealthy socialites. Beautiful\ncinematography completes the\nvisual experience. See What's on for\ndetails.\nA. I. good position at the end makes the\npain disappear remarkably quickly,\nand personal best placings were\nachieved by Frank, Matt, Stefan and\nBill Skailes, in 7th,38 th,46 th and\n56th places respectively. Dave\nKnight, involved in a keen battle\nwith Matt and Stefan in the later\nstages, recorded his best this year\nwith 42nd. Another creditable\nperformance came from John\nRowland, with 67th. In the women's section, Alison\nHorrocks admitted to having a bad\nrun, finishing 24th. Despite the\nlowly-sounding postion s of our\nrunners, one must bear in mind the\noverall size of the field (150 men)\nand the quality of the leading\nathletes (the race was won by a county champion). The fact that\nover 20 minutes separated first and\nlast (a Kings runner, of course)\nreflects the very wide range of\nability supported by this sport.\nThe club will be staging the Hyde\nPark Relay on Feb 18th, one of the\nmajor inter-university fixtures of the\nyear. All enquiries regarding this to\nDave Knight, Physics 2.\nF. Dudridge\nFOOTBALL\nStill\nUnbeaten\nImperial College VI\u20141\nSt Bartholemews\u20141\nIC VI continued their resurgence up\nthe table with a bruising draw to\nextend their unbeaten run to 4\ngames. In a highly physical confrontation, IC took the lead horn\nan exquisite move from the back,\nfinished off by Andy Draine, after\nsome brilliant one-touch football.\nJust before half-time, Martin Cole's superbly timed covering tackle was\njudged a foul by the referee due to\nsome the at ric s by the forward, and\nBarfs equalise d from the subsequent\nfree-kick. A rare defensive lapse\nnearly allowed Barts to\n(undeservedly) steal the lead, but\nthe post and then Martin Cole\nquickly came to the rescue to clear\nthe danger. Eiji Fukumuro nearly\nwon the game for IC when his\nthundering header went just wide\nwith the goalkeeper helpless.\nTurkey\nThe Turkey campaign is now entering its final stage in which the\nlobbying of members of the\nEuropean Parliament is carried out\nby different A I Groups. The IC\nGroup, together with the Putney\nand Kingston Groups are currently\nin contact with Dave Stelagh\nRoberts. This lobbying aims to have\na certain pressure exerted on Turkey\nfor an improvement of the Human Rights record. An increased\nj. varen ess by the European Parliament members of the reality of\nthe violation of Human Rights in that country is particularly\nimportant at a time when it seeks to\npresent a clean image in the issue\nof Human Rights with a view to\nbecome a members of the EEC. So far, we have been contacting\nMPs and have obtained responses\nfrom the Labour Group and Toby\nJessel (Tory MP for Twickenham)\nwho assured us they were ensuring\nthat the Foreign Office should\nclosely monitor Turkish polk v and\npractices on such issues.\nThanks to all those who helped.\nRIFLE & PISTOL\nVictory\nOn 1st February a ten men team\nfrom Cambridge University arrived\nat IC to face the might of our pistol\nteam. Two courses of five were shot:\none small bore and one full bore.\nDespite being out of practice the\nImperial team (P. Deeks, I. Draper,\nR. Winskill, A. Jones, M. Lacey and\nT.

Willis is\nquite excellent in the role, displaying\na hitherto un for seen aptitude for\nthis action-adventure stuff.\nBut he really is totally upstaged by\na wickedly sophisticated and sardonic portrayal of Gruber by\nRickman, an RSC actor, previously\nrenowned for his stage performance\nin Les Liaisons Dangereuses. He is the\nultimate in cool-dome; assured,\nsmooth and deadly. He electrifies\nthe screen with his presence and is\noddly appealing. T am not an\nordinary thief, I am an exceptional\nthief he roars with a maniacal\nintensity.\nThe film engages our emotions\nfrom the outset and makes us cry\nout at the ineptitude and downright\nidiotic antics of the police and FBI\nagents, who can never get their act\ntogether. The FBI in particular,\nrepresented by Agent Johnson and\nSpecial Agent Johnson (no relation),\nare hilarious, dressed in expensive\nfinally emerging as a king with\nwhom we feel England will be safe.\nIn the first half we are treated to\nfine comic scenes; these are centred\nin an Eastcheap inn and later, in the\nCotswolds. Barry Stanton as Falstaff\nprovides an excellent comic focus.\nHis cowardice and cunning drop\nhim into tricky situations out of\nwhich he wriggles (or waddles) his\nway.\nFalstaff is the perfect buffoon, he\nrealises this to some extent saying;\nT am not only witty in myself, but\nthe cause of wit in other men'\nThrough all his using scheming\nFalstaff displays a real affection for\nHal, always having in mind (though\noften his motives are selfish),\ninventing new amusements for\nPrince Harry.\nFalstaff uses his friendliness with\nHal to borrow money and win favour. The final scene in which Hal\nDangerous\nLiasons\nIf he who lives by the sword also\ndies by the sword, then what of the\nman who lives by the powers of\nseduction? Choderlos de Laclos first\nposed this question in his erotic\nnovel, Les Liaisons Dangereuses.\nHis story of the nimble\ngamesmanship of the pre-revolution\nFrench aristocracy was turned into\na successful play by the RSC, which\nrivetted audiences with a series of\npsychological twists. Now comes\nsuits, shades and Rambo\nmentalities. Stereotypes maybe, but\ngood fun all the same.\nThere are no doubts about the\nentertainment value of this film. It\nis tense, gripping, in parts\nintentionally hilarious, and it'll have\nyou jumping in your seats. This is\nsomething you won't want to miss.\nSumit Guha\nrejects Falstaff, gives Falstaff a severe knock and he is broken (for\na while at least).\nThis production is a little rough at\nthe edges. Sometimes the\nsupporting cast delivers its lines\nwith a lacklustre manner (many of\nits members have large roles in other\nplays) but the standard is generally\nhigh. The mix of costumes from\ndifferent periods helps emphasise\nthe characters from Henry IV down\nto the tavern derelicts.\nMichael Bogdanov has included\nsome good directional tricks which\nbring fresh life to an already spirited\nplay. This is a good production,\ngetting the balance between comedy\nand seriousness right. Seeing it after\nHenry IV parti would be best; the\ntwo together making a good set\nalthough parti stands well on its\nown.\nPatrick Smith\nthe big screen Hollywood adaptation starring Glenn Close\n(Fatal Attraction), John Malkovitch\n(Empire of the Sun), arid Michelle\nPfeiffer (Witches of Eastwick).\nThe screenplay keeps true to the\nspirit of the play, both having been\nwritten by Christopher Hampton,\nand the period details and locations\nlook stunning.\nThe film is set in a time of\nlegendary decadence, with wealthy,\nperfumed characters fully dedicated\nto the pursuit of their own pleasure.\nThey spin for themselves a plot of\nlabyrinthine sexual intrigue as they\nsuccumb to each others seduction.\nDangerous Liaisons promises to be\na visual delight, but will probably go\ndown with countless others as a film\nwhich didn't quite match its stage\nimpact. Release Date 10th March.\nSumit Guha\nHenry IV\npart 2\nEngland is still troubled by civil war.\nHal, the Prince of Wales has\nresumed to his bawdy haunts. Hal's friend Falstaff, a decadent, inept and\nold knight, is in the Cotswolds\nputting his newfound, false, glory\nfor great financial advantage.\nA new group of rebels led by the\nArchbishop of York, build a new\narmy. The rebels are confronted by\nthe King's son, Prince John, and are\ncaptured.\nHenry IV is dying; on his deathbed he and Hal are reconciled.\nHal is crowned Henry V and rejects\nhis former companions.\nHenry IV part 2 relies heavily on\npart 1. In structure it is similar,\nhaving a largely comic first act and\na more serious second act; the\nscenes roughly correspond to those\nin part 1. There is a substantial\ncontinuation of character and theme, making it a play best seen\nwith a knowledge of part 1.\nThe play builds up through both\nacts to the reconciliation scene,\nmuch of the action points towards\nthis. Throughout the play in Michael\nCronin as Henry IV we see a character battling to appear tough\nand struggling with his guilt of\nusurping the crown (which he\nbegins to see as a curse); his\nthoughts about Hal become more\ndesperate as his illness gets worse.\nHal realises and embraces his\nresponsibilities as the play develops,\nPage 16 FELIX February 10 1989\n\n"

Since the 1950s when\nhe helped found the legendary\nMarquee Club, then in Oxford\nStreet, his band of dedicated\nmusicians has toured the world and\nrecorded a broad range of musical\nstyles with a plethora of great\nmusicians. It was he who first\nbrought legendary blues giants such\nas Howlin' Wolf to Britain from\nAmerica and his weekly sessions at\nthe Marquee launched the R&B craze in the 1950s. At lot has happened in the years\nsince, but Barbers Jazz and Blues\nBand is still a group of dedicated\nmusicians surviving it's personnel\nchanges through the years. Their\nreturn to the 100 Club was an\nimpressive show of traditional jazz,\nswing and mellow blues; rough yet\nclean, original foot stomping music\ndelivered with an enthusiasm\ndisguising their years. At home\nplaying slow blues or shouting,\npowerful jazz, all eight blend their\ninstruments together without losing\ntheir individuality. Pat Halcox's muted trumpet on Spanish Castles,\nthe inspired double bass of Vic Pitt\nas he launches into a blinding solo,\nor the almost be-bop tenor\nsaxophone with which John Crocker\nbeautifully slides in and out of the\nmelodies, all were worthy of the\ncapacity crowd that night. Their\nsuccess is undoubtedly the product\nof a passion for jazz shared by two\nfriends who wanted to start a band\n35 years ago.

In his\noperas the most moving and genuine passages deal with these\nwonderful ideas which are the\nrenewal of life, and an end to life.\nMozart was an attentive and affectionate lover as can be seen\nfrom his letters to his wife\nConstanze. Seven years into their\nmarriage, while he was away in Dresden, he wrote\n'Dearest little wife, if only I had\na letter from you! If I were to tell you\nall the things I do with your dear\nportrait I think you would often\nlaugh. For instance, when I take it\nout of its case, I say, 'Good-day,\nStanzerl! Good-day, little rascal,\npussy-pussy, little turned-up nose,\nlittle bagatelle, Schluck und Druck',\nand when I put it away again, I let\nit slip in very slowly, saying all the\ntime, ' NuN uN uNu!' with the\npeculiar emphasis which this word\nso full of meaning demands, and\nthen just at the last, quickly, ' Good night, little mouse, sleep well.' Well,\nI suppose I have been writing\nsomething very foolish (to the world\nat all events); but to us who love\neach other so dearly, it is not foolish\nat all. Today is the sixth day since\n1 left you and by Heaven! it seems\na year.'\nHis operas are full of complex\nlove-affairs which usually end happily, such as those in his most\nfamous opera Le Nozze di Figaro.\nThe plot is rather light, but caused\na stir among the aristocracy of the\ntime because it showed the servants\nof the household plotting against,\nand making a fool of, their masters.\nWe start with Figaro, man-servant\nof the Count Almaviva, calling out\nthe measurements for the room\nwhich is to contain his wedding-bed. His fiancee, the sc run ty Susanna, tells him that the Count\nhas designs on her. The countess is\nen amour ed of a young and handsome page called Cherubino\nwho spends a great deal of time\nhiding in cupboards and climbing\nout of back windows. Figaro is loved\nby a crinkly old woman, Marcellina,\nwho is old enough to be his mother,\nand who actually turns out to be his\nmother. The complexity reaches its\nheight when the Count asks\nSusanna to do something that a fiancee really should not, but she\ndupes him by swapping dresses\nwith the countess so that the Count\ncommits adultery with his own wife. To save face he declares his\nlove for her and everyone sings a happy chorus.\nMozart's character also had a deeper and more serious side. This\ncan be seen in a letter he wrote to\nhis father Leopold, whom he loved\ngreatly, on hearing of his illness.\n'...but now I hear that you are\nreally ill. I need hardly tell you how\ngreatly I am longing to receive some\nreassuring news from yourself. And I still expect it; although I have now\nmade a habit of being prepared in\nall affairs of life for the worst. As death, when we come to consider it\nclosely, is the true goal of our\nexistence, I have formed during the\nla*! few years such close relations\nwith this best and truest friend of\nmankind, that his image is not only\nno longer terrifying to me, but is\nindeed very soothing and consoling.\nAnd I thank my God for graciously\ngranting me the opportunity (you\nknow what I mean) of learning that\ndeath is the KEY which unlocks the\ndoor to our true happiness.'\nOld Motzie himself\nHis masterpiece, the Requiem,\nwas commissioned by a 'stranger in\ngrey'. He became convinced that he\nhad been poisoned with acqua\nt of fana,a designer poison of the\nseventeenth century, as his wife\ndescribed after his death\n'Some six months before his death\nhe was possessed with the idea of\nhis being poisoned - T know I must\ndie,' he exclaimed, 'someone has\ngiven me acqua to ff an a and has\ncalculated the precise time of my\ndeath\u2014for which they have ordered\na Requiem, it is for myself that I am\nwriting this.'\nHis wife forced him to put it aside,\nand so he wrote a masonic ode\nwhich was a great success. This\ngave him confidence to return to the\nRequiem, but within a few days of\nstarting he fell ill and died a few\nmonths later. To the last he worked\non the Requiem, dictating to his\npupil Sussmayr, and telling him how to complete the work. A woman at his bedside wrote 'his last\nmovement was an attempt to\nexpress with his mouth the drum\npassages in the Requiem. That I can\nstill hear.'\nHear it for yourself: Philips 411\n420-2.\nFebruary 10 1989 FELIX Page 15\n\n"

    "content": "as the truth.\nThe theology of science\nScience and technology are the\nreligion of the twentieth century. In\nmany cases scientific theory Comes\nacross as scientific fact in lectures\nand past and present scientists of\neminent status are held in awe. This\nis aided by the principle of scientific\ninertia where new ideas are rejected\nfor no greater a reason than the\nprevailing scientific establishment\nnot wishing to admit to being\nwrong. Furthermore this cult is\npromoted by the use of evermore\nesoteric terms which even fellow\nscientists out of that particular field\ncannot often understand,let alone\nthe average person in the street who\nholds science in awe, believing it to\nbe the answer to the world's problems. Yet I believe that the\nuniverse is but a transient state of\nGod's will and that the supposed\nwisdom of men will prove in the\nend to be meaningless as the\nuniverse passes away.\nDespite so many breakthroughs in\nmodern science the world appears\nto face more and more disasters and\nproblems with each passing year.\nScience can solve the problems of\nmalnutrition and disease in the\nworld and yet its results can often\nnot be implemented due to society's political and moral inadequacy.\nFurthermore disasters and accidents\nwill always occur to the end of time.\nYet Marxism and Scientific\nHumanism are based on the concept\nthat human nature is inherently\ngood despite it being a result of\nrandom chaotic evolutionary processes which Marxism and Scientific Humanism hold to be\ntrue.\nI think that it takes as much faith\nto believe in evolution as it does to\nbelieve in Jesus and the claims that\nhe made. However, people prefer to\nbelieve in the former rather than the\nlatter as it makes them feel more in\ncontrol of their destiny; talk of\nChrist and the Bible makes them feel\nuncomfortable. I think that modern\nscience has in itself become a religion which is the very thing that\nit was originally trying to escape\nfrom and still tries to remain distinct\nfrom. One must ask the question:\n'Does science limit my perception of\nGod or does God fulfil my perception of science? ' The centrality of science in modern\nthinking means that many people\nfind it im posible to have a perception of God. Yet science can\nneither prove nor disprove God: 'For since the creation of the world\nGod's invisible qualities - his eternal\npower and divine nature - have\nbeen clearly seen, being understood\nfrom what has been made, so that\nmen are without excuse.'\n(Romans lv20) Loans\npublicity\nStudent loans and the associated\nbenefit cuts form the biggest ever\nthreat to education in this country\nin recorded history.\nContrary to popular opinion the\nbenefit cuts are not in the white\npaper for student loans, but were\npassed in last year's Social Security\nReforms Bill. These cuts are total,\nand will mean that students can\nclaim no benefits either during term\ntime or over the Summer vacation.\nThis includes rent rebates, housing\nbenefit, and income supplement.\nStudents will also have to pay 20%\npoll tax, although this may be\nincreased to 50%. No increase in grant will be made to compensate\nfor this. For many students this will\nresult in an \u00a3800 per annum loss of\nincome, and a projected debt of\n\u00a36000 over a three year course. All these figures are before the grant is\nfrozen.\nThis will have knock on effects in\neducation as students with large\ndebts will not be able to to accept\npoorly paid teaching jobs,\nproducing a shortage of qualified\n' A' level teachers.\nThis will then, over a period of\nfive years, create a massive collapse\nin education, as teachers will not be\nable to train students to a standard\nto make them cao able of teaching\n' O' level. This will increase the\nshortage of educated people, and\npeople who are educated are\nneeded by industry. It seems that\nwe are starting a five year charter to\ndestroy the education system which\ntook so long to achieve. There will\nalso be a massive class divide set up\ndenying some of the country's most\nintelligent people a un iver is ty education. Despite this our Union\nis doing its best to deny students\ninformation concerning action being\ntaken to fight loans, and is in some\ncases deliberately lying, so as to\nmislead students. This was most\nnotable on the First of February\ndemonstration, organised by a committee of seven, consisting of six\nUnion presidents, and a member of\nthe UL U Executive.\nOf these seven, none were\nmembers of the Socialist Workers\nParty and only one, namely Keith\nBudden ( UL U Executive), a member\nof Militant.\nOn Tuesday 24th January I personally informed Nigel Baker\nthat he could get any information he\nneeded about the march from either\nof the SO AS co-presidents. I also\ninformed him that the organising\ngroup were not members of Socialist\nWorker.\nIn full knowledge of this he\nproceeded to write an 'Executive\nannouncement' he knew to be\nfactually incorrect. The actual\ncontent of this announcement, and\nits wording were never agreed by\nICU Executive.\nThis factually incorrect an noun cement, along with the correct but\nincomplete 'Loans demo faces set\nback' news story in FELIX was the\nonly information students were\npermitted to receive, and on the\nbasis of these most students decided\nthat the march was liable to be a badly organised riot.\nThe London Loans Campaign\ngroup (the organisers) produced a poster, and a leaflet to promote the\nmarch, but these posters were torn\ndown by the Union.\nThese posters did not contravene\nany of the Union publicity rules, and\nwhen asked for the reason for\nremoval of the posters, Ian Morris\n(Hon Sec Events), read through the\nrules and settled on rule ten. This\nis as follows-10. Interpretation Interpretation of\nthese rules rests with ICU House\nCommitee and the ICU publicity\nofficer.\nI then asked him which rule he\nwas interpreting, and he restated\nrule 10.\nSince he was not interpreting any\nrule he could not invoke rule 10.\nSince then Ian has been\napproached by Fizz Marsh (Union\nPublicity Officer) and asked for an\nexplanation. He then changed his\nmind and said that House Committee agreed that all posters\nmust have the name of an iCU club\non them. This was not a valid excuse\nfor the following two reasons-1) The\nposters had ICU SWSS written on\nthem. 2) rule 11 of the publicity rules\nclearly states-11. Alteration Alteration of these\nrules is subject to a majority decision\nby ICU Council.\nTherefore House Committee had\nno power to make such a decision\nand by not allowing the posters to\nbe displayed Ian and Nigel overturned a decision of Council,\nand broke the constitution to which\nthey are bound.\nOn the day (Wednesday 1st) we\nproved ourselves. The march was\nwell stewarded, and over two thousand people attended. The\nmarch stayed on the route, and there was not a single arrest.\nOf course most of you won't have\nbeen on the march, or know much\nabout it's organisation and success,\nbut so long as no-one complains\nwhen your Executive lie to you, or\nrestrict your access to information -you will retain 'your right to be\ndeceived'.\nAndy (not SWSS) Garside\nOpinion\nWALTER\nWALTER\nWALTER\nJust for once, Walter intends to leave\nthe whole miserable business of\nUnion politics alone for this week,\nand to concentrate on a far worthier\nmatter. That's right, friends and\nneighbours, it's that Valentines time\nof year again.\nDifferent people celebrate the day\nof St Valentine for different reasons.\nAmong our own ranks, Eric Ash celebrates because it reminds him of\nwhen he met Clare, and Chas\nBrereton celebrates because it\nremind him of the massacre. Walter\ncelebrates for the simple reason that\nthis is one season when love is in\nthe air, and when the whole of the\nrace is, at least theoretically, in harmony. In the spirit of this\nharmony, your columnist would\nlike to suggest a set of matches\nwhich he feels could be made\namong various public figures, both\nwithin and without this institution.\nTo start with, the Catering\nManager Rob Northey should team\nup with either of the Roux brothers.\nMr Northey's cuisine could only\nbenefit from this, and the Roux\nBrothers have shown a certain\nnaive it yin commercial matters\nwhich Rob the Fixer would soon put\npaid to. Cecil Parkinson, who has\nbeen psycho analysed as being in need of a mother-figure, should try\na match with Mrs Jen Hardy- Smith,\nwho in addition to providing a mother-figure, would also keep him well on the straight and narrow.\nMary Whitehouse's husband - poor\nman - really ought to see the other\nside of life as provided by Cynthia\nPaine, and as for Mrs Whitehouse\nherself, Walter recommends a dose\nof Harvey Proctor; this should at\nleast be entertaining.\nThe world of entertainment itself\ncould see the meeting of Terry\nWogan, who brings junk television\nto the boobs among the populace,\nand Sky TVs latest find, Dolly\nParton, who brings boob television\nto the junk around the world.\nAnd finally - for there must\nalways be an 'and finally' - Walter\nwould dearly love to see the Union\nof Margaret Thatcher and Neil\nKinnock, to be subtitled \"Gruesome\nGrocer and the Welsh Wimp\". Oh, to be a fly on the wall\nFebruary 10 1989 FELIX Page 13\n\n"

The EG M was called to discuss\nthe financial situation of the paper,\nwhich faces a projected deficit of\n\u00a322,000 by June. The paper has\noperated without a student editor\nsince the resignation of sabbatical\neditor Jane Headon last term.\nNicola Jones, Vice-President of\nUL U with responsibility for Finance\nand Administration, proposed the\nappointment of staff member\nLawrence Cosnett as editor. The\nmotion was passed by the five\nrepresentatives attending the EG M. Miss Jones explained that the move\nwas a 'temporary measure only' and\nthat she hoped it would be possible\nto return the editorial control of the\nnewspaper to a student sabbatical in\nthe next academic year.\nAt the General University Council\non Tuesday. Miss Jones proposed\nan increase in grant for London\nStudent.\nUnion Day of Action\nThe Union will be holding a series\nof events in the Union Building on\nThursday in support of the National\nUnion of Students (NUS) campaign\nagainst student loans.\nStudents voted to boycott lectures\nat the Union General Meeting last\nTuesday but the College has\ndeclined to co-operate by re-timetabling lectures.\nThe events in the Union will\ninclude a speech by MP for Tottenham Bernie Grant and a letter\nwriting session. A comedian, a Marx\nBrothers' film, a pool competition\nand a table football competition are\n'so planned. The Union Bar will\nalso be open all day with a Furstenberg Fest Bier promotion.\nThe day will be ended by a Rag\n'Gaming Night', with a casino and\nhorse racing.\nIn London, .the National Union of\nStudents in London ( NUS London)\nare hoping to organise a 'rally'\noutside the Department of\nEducation and Science. A spokesman for NUS London told\nFELIX that publicity was being\nproduced for the ; ally on Tuesday\nalthough N USL cndo n are still in negotiations with the Police to\nobtain permission for it.\nBR Offer cheap Railcards\nBritish Rail is offering half price rail\nfares to Young Persons Railcard\nholders until February 25. Railcards\nare also on sale at half the normal\nprice of \u00a315 until February 25. 16 to\n23 year-olds and mature students in\nfull-time education are eligible for a rail card.

To put it another way,\nyour correspondent spent last\nSaturday at Imperial College Science\nFiction society's 'PicoCon'\nThe culture shock is\ninstantaneous. The outsider,\nplucking up his courage, enters the\nhallowed portals of the Union building and approaches the SFers\nat reception. 'Are-you-eye-see-ess-eff?', the duty SFette enquires ' No' he nervously replies. 'Astra?' Again\nthe answer would seem to be\nnegative. He is labeled as a heretic\nand is handed a tell tale blue badge.\n30% of the contents in at least one\ncase. The underlying purpose\nbehind this seemingly innocent ploy\nis to make FELIX the only\npublication which fully understands\nthe idiotic farces that take place in\nthe loony bin. It is a well known ploy in publishing to keep the\ndramatic facts secret and print\nsomething that is completely\nuninformative. FELIX is falling into\nthis trap. FELIX has totally rejected\nthe offer of supreme editorial power\nfrom the Union. If this offer had\nbeen accepted the Sabbaticals would\nhave edited printed and produced\nthe paper and as a weekly hee bie given an Exec News insert.\nHowever the staff are bound by some wie rd chant of 'Editorial\nFreedom' and remain oblivious to\nthis offer.\nWendy (Ian) Morris Hon Sec for\nThe outsider sets out to explore\nthis strange new world. In the\ncorner of the entrance hall stands a black board optimistically\nproclaiming no problems. On the\nwall an arrow points to something\ncalled a' fan room'. Intrigued, he\nfollows it.\nWhat strange creatures inhabit\nthis place? In one corner a gaggle of\npeople lean t over buzzing, bleeping\ncomputers busy blasting digital\naliens to tech nicol our smithereens.\nIn another wizards and hobbits fight\neach other with notepad s and dice.\nAt the very back of the room,\nhidden behind rows of brightly\npainted plastic rockets, sat a genuine enthusiast, the first of the\nday. Al l around people were talking\nexcitedly of Pratchett and Langford\nand Shaw, of the last CONNIE and\nof ICON91. The outsider,\nover weal med, wanders out.\nUpstairs he finds more SFers,\nworshippers of the great god TeeVee. He slips quietly into the room\nand stands by the door. On the\nscreen, an enormously fat man\nexplodes. The audience is both\nnauseated and delighted. He leaves\nevents attempted to express his\nopinions in a recent rant article. If\nhe pays a little more attention to\nseeking supreme power Ian could\nexhibit an outstanding year for his\nUnion rather than organising discos\nfor the regular six American attenders. FELIX is here to project\na view on every issue. It should be\ncompletely accountable to the\nPresident and totally banned from\nprinting anything which in anyway\ncondemns the action of the Union.\nIn this way students will be\nprotected from the need to express\nany opinion or to have any say in\nthe running of their ruling body. It\nis a system which has wp rke d brilliantly in Russia. Why not try it\nhere in Imperial (Russia)? Come on\nFELIX think about it sensibly.\nThe Editor\nAlthough the best candidate for the\njob at the time of the elections easily\nbeating his opponent to the stark\nhorror of the existing supremo Ms McHackney, Mr William Goodwin\nhas since been discovered a horrible\nfraud. Not only did he run the\nelection under the false name of Bill,\na tactic strictly outlawed in the\nfading turquoise Union bible, but\nhis strange sexual history and outrageous sexual perversions were\nkept stic t ly secret. The election was\nobviously one of the most successful\ncover-ups ever performed. However\nsince October Bill has come out of\nthe closet. His harrowing desire to\nbe the mother of other peoples\nbabies has been revealed and I again.\nBack in the entrance hall the\nblackboard's luck has run out: it\nnow informs the world that the bar\nwill not be open for another hour.\nNearby, worried looking beings in\nICSF sweatshirts discuss lost guests.\nThe outsider pokes his head\naround the door of something\nominously named Battle of the\nPlants, fully expecting to see an\nas pid is tra and a rubber plant locked\nin mortal combat. Instead he sees\ntwo dozen humanoids. One of them\ngets up and faces the others. He is\nhanded a piece of paper. At a signal\nhe begins to wave his hands about\nwildly. The others shout at him,\n'Book!', ' Film!!',' How many Syllables?!!'. Suddenly he jumps up\nand points excitedly at some\nrandom SFer, apparently the\nwinner. The prize would seem to be\na question, a question of such\nobscurity that no normal person\ncould possibly answer it. As a rule,\nit is answered correctly. After half\nan hour or so, the outsider sidles\nout, his head spinning.\nIt is the afternoon. The blackboard\nin the entrance hall is a polo gi sing suspect there is worse to come.\nOn the work side there is yet more\nscandal. A dark and sinister\npersonality has been revealed in wild personal attacks on our meek\npresident Nigel Baker typified in the\nscandalous editorial in which Bill\nacc cussed Mr Baker of being an' overgrown kiddie' and subsequently even sank to the depths\nof 'below the belt' personal attacks\nand labelled the leader as an 'infant\nmegalomaniac'. Come on Bill. Nigel\nwas simply trying to turn over\nsupreme power to himself,\ninvalidate all the views of students\nin thr Union, destroy all known forms of democracy, conceal all\ndecisions and actions from FELIX\nand the College, and maintain his\nblissful relationship with the lovely\ndoctors and nurses in Paddington.\nIs that really to much to ask?\nIndeed secret sources have\nrevealed that the voice heard at the\nU GM chanting 'this is exactly how\nNazi Germany started', was that of\nMr Goodwin himself. We must ask\nourselves how this fiend slipped\nthrough our rigorous election\nprocedure. It must not happen\nagain. Mr Goodwin is a ferocious\nliterary farce who ought to carry a powerful government health\nwarning to ward off the meek and\nsubmissive staff under his power.\nAt the same time deep down Bill is\na soft marsh m allowing character\nwho mI once would have\nconsidered a good partner.\nPresently I fear his future\nacademically and sexually. I'm sorry\nBill but it had to be said.\nprofusely for the loss of two guests\nto bronchitis and the late arrival of\nanother. Ruling committee\nmembers are taking it in turns to\nwear a gold hat and gibber inanely.\nThe convention starts to get going.\nThe guests are due to speak.\nThe stars of the show, and the\nheroes of the audience, are the SF\nauthors themselves.

    "content": "News Feature\nPoll Tax:the truth\nThe Poll Tax or Community Charge\nwill take effect in Scotland from the\nbeginning of April, and the rest of\nus will get it the following April. To\nthe average member of the public it\nwill mean a bill of \u00a3200-\u00a3300, and to\nstudents \u00a350-\u00a3100 per year. The Poll\nTax will take over from the present\nrating system whereby local councils\ngenerate income by charging people\naccording to the rate able value of\ntheir houses. Everyone (apart from\nthe mentally ill, elderly people living\nin homes and hospitals, and convicted prisoners) even foreign\nresidents will have to pay. Students\nwill be entitled to a80% reduction\nif they register at their College\naddress. Estimates of the charge/tax\nvary horn borough to borough, with\ncentral London generally having the\nhighest levels (see table).\nWestminster Borough (which covers\nSouthside and many intercollegiate\nhalls) would have charged \u00a3448 had\nthis been the first year of the Poll\nTax. Thus 20% of \u00a3448 = 89.60. It\nis still possible for students to\nregister at home; however, it seems\nthat then you would have to pay the\nfull amount, not a clever idea. This\ndoes not refer to registering to vote\nat home and at College which is still\npossible.\nLocal councils will send out\nregistration forms in the autumn\nwhich must be returned. There is a fine of 10% of the bill for non-return.\nThis process has occurred in Scotland, where the Minister for\nScotland, Malcolm Rifkin, claimed\nthat 99% of those eligible to pay had\nregistered. Campaigns for non-return had been organised by the\nScottish Nationalist Party, several\nrebel Labour MPs and some clergy.\nThe response of the Labour Party to\nthe Poll Tax featured heavily in the\nGlasgow Goran by-election, in which the SNP won with a large\nturn around in the Labour vote.\nScotland became a testing ground as\nthe Tories feared devastation at the\npolls after revaluation increased\nrates by up to 300% under the old\nsystem.\nNon-payment of the tax will\ninvolve a surcharge of \u00a350 on top of\nthe bill. There are claims that many\ncouncils will be unable to collect all\nthe Poll Tax due to it because of the\ndifficulties involved with keeping\ntrack of people. Under the present\nsystem, which has a high collection\nrate, thanks largely to the fact that\nhouses, unlike people hardly move,\nmany boroughs achieve 9 8 %\nregistering. However Birmingham\nCity Council estimated in the last\nyear of its existence that they\ncollected just 81%.\nThe contention behind the Poll\nTax has a long history, first\nappearing in 1377 as a tax of a Groat\nper head on people over the age of\n16. The tax was increased but as a sliding scale in1379 peasants still\npaid one grout. Then the Parliament\nof Christmas 1380 imposed a Poll\nTax of one shilling on peasants\nrising for the more well off. This\nsparked off the Peasants Revolt of\n1381 in which Wyatt Tyler achieved\nfame. After then the tax was only\nimposed on foreigners living in Britain.\nPoll taxes do not always raise the\namount of money expected. The\ndifficulty with a shortfall in collection is that simultaneous with\nthe abolition of domestic rates,\nbusinesses will not pay rates direct\nto local councils. A national business\nrate will be set, and all money\ncollected will be redistributed to\ncouncils according to population\nrather than the locality of the area.\nThe twelve inner London boroughs\ncurrently receive \u00a31,123 million in business rate income. Had the\nNational Business Tax been in force\nlast year, this income would have\ndropped to \u00a3447 million, a decrease\nof 60%. Some of the shortfall may\nhave to be met by Poll Tax payers.\nThe Business Rates will be fixed\nso any council which overspends its\nbudget will have to transfer all the\nextra burden onto the rate payer.\nThere are several questions raised\nby a compulsory registration for the\ntax with regards civil liberties.\nForeign residents who wish to\nremain anonymous from certain\ngovernment forces will probably be\nable to come to an arrangement with\ntheir local council to assume an alias\nfor the purpose of the register. The\nspectre of 'snooper' has been raised;\nmany people fear that there may be\nan army of collectors searching for\nnon-payers, and if these people do\ncome into operation which files are\nthey going to be allowed to see?\nOfficially such things as the electoral\nregister will not be used, but it does\nseem a little difficult to imagine that\nthey would not check upon someone who was registered to\nvote, but not registered to pay the\ntax. Non-payment will carry a surcharge of \u00a350 on top of the final\nbill.\nSo you may be asking, so w haL surely the difference will be met by\na drop in hall fees or rents when.\nrates are taken out? This, sadly, is\nnot automatically the case. The rates\nfor College halls are paid for by the\nUGC and intercollegiate halls have\ntheir's paid for by the University\nCourt Department which is UGC funded. The UGC is itself on the\nverge of abolition and so it seems\nvery unlikely that the replacement\nUniversity Funding Committee will\npay your Poll Tax. Accommodation\noutside halls will not necessarily go\ndown automatically for the rents\nwould have to be regis ted before\nlandlords had a legal obligation to\nreduce them with the abolition of\nrates. Most rents do not fall into this\ncategory. Student grants will not be\nincreased to pay for the extra\nexpenditure.\nSo what are the alternatives?\nOpposition parties agree with the\nGovernment that the present\nsystem is not fair. However, they\nbelieve the Poll Tax to be even more\nunfair. The Labour Party would like\nto introduce a combination of local\nincome tax and property tax. The\nDemocrats would like to see a local\nincome tax.\nOpinion Bit\n\"The Poll Tax is fair only in the sense\nthat the Black Death was fair; it is\nindiscriminate, striking young and\nold, rich and poor, employed and\nunemployed alike'\u2014Tory Reform\nGroup, March 1987.\nAs this is an opinion article I shall\nresist from calling the Poll Tax a Community Charge, for it is by\ndefinition a tax on voting. Having\ncampaigned in several local\nelections it is clear that the present\nrating system is unpopular, and\nfrequently the example is given of\na grey haired old widow paying the\nsame rates for her semi as the Mr and Mrs Jones and working son or\ndaughter next door. The unfairness\nof the system is not just that one\nperson is paying the same as three,\nbut that there is a differential in incomes. At present it happens that\na handful of areas of a borough may\npay the majority of the rates for that\ntown. However, they are out-voted\nat district elections by people who\nare not affected so much by the\nincrease in rates. Thus resentment\nhas built up whenever rates\nincrease. The Conservatives hope\nthat by making everyone (bar the\npoor and other exceptions) pay the\nsame that the chances of the\nConservatives gaining control of\ncouncils increases.\nThe Poll Tax will also further\ndiminish the student grant yet\nfurther as no allowance will be\nmade. The Poll Tax will also cost\nmore (about twice as much as\npresent rates) to collect, and there\nwill be more bureaucracy. It has\nbeen said that a hearth tax (or a window tax (1697-1815) would be\nfairer. Anyway the proof of the tax\nwill come in April 1990 when it\narrives through letter boxes and the\nensuing district elections.\nGreater London Student figures in brackets\nBorough Full Poll Tax 1st Year\nper adult Poll Tax\nCamden 639.00 (127.80) 438.00 ( 87.60)\nHammersmith 578.00 (115.60) 347.00 ( 69.40)\nKensington 340.00 I68.00)384.00(76.80) Westminster 373.00 ( 74.60) 448.00 I89.60) Hounslow 243.00 ( 48.60) 277.00 ( 55.40)\nRichmond 259.00 ( 51.80) 325.00 ( 65.00)\nOther Examples\nChelmsford 229.00 304.00\nIpswich 215.00 238.00\nGuildford 266.00 339.00\nRochdale 278.00 228.00\nBath 259.00 238.00\nMiddlesborough 282.00 254.00\nLlamelli 160.00 137.00\nEdinburgh City 334.00*\n* Includes water charges.\nThe following tables show Government estimates of Poll Tax/Community\nCharges.

    "content": "Reviews\nHenry V The Wars of the Roses : Episode 4.\nYoung Prince Hal, likely lad, reveller, drinker of sack, is king. He\nhas revoked his past, transformed\nto adulthood and decided to claim\nFrance as his own, on the\nconsultation of the Archbishop of\nCanterbury.\nThe French are informed, but take\nthe threat lightly. Henry assembles\nhis armies, deals with a few rebels\nat Southampton, and sets sail for the\ncontinent. Amongst the soldiers are\nPistol, Bardolph and Ny m,old friends from the Boar's Head Tavern, and sources of humour and\nlessons in morality.\nThe town of Harfleur is taken and\nthe Battle of Agincourt commences.\nHenry's army is outnumbered 5 to\n1 yet sustains only thirty losses\ncompared to 10,000 French deaths.\nWith the battle lost the French King\nCharles VI surrenders to Henry's terms. Marriage is proposed to\nKatherine, Charles' daughter, who accepts.\nIn order that this simple historical\nstory becomes an entertaining\nproduction, the Bard has created a rousing tale of fervent nationalism,\nbrotherhood and glory. Director\nMichael Bogdanov has extended\nthis to bolster a patriotism which\nwould shame Oliver North and could con cie v ably knock several\npoints of the Eurotunnel shares.\nThe production is slick, the sets\nminimalist and effective, the\nchanges smooth. The ambiguous\nand anachronistic setting of the\npiece, now the norm in Shakespearian theatre, is a crossbreed of Victorian England and\nWorld War II.\nThe underlying theme of this\nstaging remains its contrasting view\nof opposing states. In battle the King\ninspires his troops, ' God save\nHarry,England, and St.George !'\nThey respond as only the English\ncan - the sailing from Southampton\nis a scene of riotous marching\nskinheads, with a chant of 'Here we\ngo' and a banner proclaiming 'Fuck\nthe Frogs'.\nThe placid, casual and aloof air of\nthe enemy is maintained throughout, with the exception of\nthe Dauphin's character, a militant\nand war hungry individual, humorous in his disposition, both\nto the audience and his peers.\nThe standard of acting is very\nhigh. Many of the players cope with\ndifficult text and demanding regional accents. Three people stand\nout though: Sion Probert, as the\nofficer Lluellen, puts such strength\nand conviction into his part as to\nleave an impression that the Welsh\nare unparalleled in patriotism. And who would disagree?\nThe Dauphin, performed by Andrew Jarvis, has a madness and\nvolatility, and not least a funny\nwalk, which convinced me that he\nwasn't acting at all. I look toward to\nseeing him as Richard III next week.\nJohn Dougall, in the guise of the\nking, ensures that the central\ncharacter is never superceded. In\neach scene he appears, full attention\nremains on his every movement or\nword. Dougall draws the audience\nin and refuses to release them.\nThis production has to be highly\nrecommended to all, and must\nsurely be strong competition for\nsimilar compilation at the Barbican.\nThe Old Vic is very pretty, and the\nice-cream excellent, if expensive. In\na word faultless.\nAndrew Clarke.\nThe Dead\nCan't Lie\nWhen I went into this film, I assumed it would be some kind of\nMafia, underworld type thriller.\nThis theory was confirmed by the\nappearance of a 'Film Noir' type\nprivate investigator called Mallard\n(possible rip-off of Marlow). Mr Mallard is lured to find some jewels\nof suspect origin by an affluent\nclient.\nAt this point the attractive female\nco-star turns up. The usual happens\nbetween her and Mr.Mallard, it\nturns out that she is also after the\njewels. This is complicated by the\nfact that despite appearances, she is\nin fact dead.\nThis poses some interesting\nquestions. What possible use does\na corpse have for 1 million dollars\nof jewellery? What is the legal\nposition of someone guilty of\nunpremeditated necrophilia? What\nam I doing in this cinema?\nAnyway the plot trundles along\nwith the occasional 'shock\nrevelations' you have anticipated for\nat least 30 minutes. This is basically\na story of two dimensional characters involved in a plot of\ncontradictions such as the fact that\ngoing to bed with a ghost is a fatal\nexperience (even with a condom)\nyet Mallard looks remarkably\nhealthy at the end. Basically a film\nthat spends far too long getting\ngoing and by the time something\ndoes, you wish it hadn't bothered.\nMike Morton\nSlipstream\nIts a few years since Mark Hamill\nlast took to the screen, not since\nReturn of the Jedi in fact. The long\nbreak and a radically different part\nallows him to break the typecasting\nwhich Luke Skywalker invoked, but\nunfortunately this film proves little\nmore than a springboard to relaunch his career.\nHamill plays Tasker, a hardened\ncop with an itchy trigger finger,\nintent on bringing a murderer in for\ntrial and execution. His success will\nlead to a healthy reward and a ticket\nto easier life 'downstream'.\nByron is the murderer, a conservative looking character in a pinstripe suit blessed with an\nexpansive knowledge of history,\nliterature and philosophy. He is an\nintriguing and confusing person,\nuntil it is revealed that he isn'ta person at all. He is instead an\nintriguing and confusing android.\nWhile in Tasker's custody, Byron\nis kidnapped by Matt Owens, a smuggler with J.R. Ewing accent and\nMichael Hutchence (of INXS) looks.\nOwens can see the financial\nadvantages of reaching the\nsettlement with his captive and\ntakes to the air.\nThe chase is on, through a wilderness world of canyons and\nravines, the result of Mother Earth's revolt against pollution. As the\ncharacters progress they encounter\na diverse assortment of guest stars\n- Robbie Coltrane, Ben Kingsley,\nF. Murray Abraham - who die\nsomewhat needlessly and generally\nat Tasker's bidding.\nThe entire affair is pretty lack-lustre, and seemingly pointless.\nByron and Matt have a short\nexchange at the close concerning the\ndangers of humanity, but this is the\nonly insight into an otherwise\ninaccessible lesson. Despite\nadvertising which made this film\nlook appealing and a leading female\nwho is, you must surely have better\nthings to do with your time.\nAndrew Clarke\nFebruary 10 1989 FELIX Page 17\n\n"

    "content": "Felix\nEditorial\nThe papers for this year's sabbatical elections will go up on Monday. Hopefully,\nthis year will see all four sabbatical posts keenly fought. There is nothing worse\nthan an uncontested election, or as was the case last year, an election in which\nmost of the opposing candidates were joke candidates.\nFor the first time, students this year will have the option of voting for a 'new\nelection'. In the case of posts for which only one candidate is standing the candidate\nwill still have to prove him- or her- self to the electorate.\nThe following posts are up for grabs:\nPresident. The President is theoretically responsible for the overall organisation of the\nUnion and represents the Union to the College. The President also takes responsibility for\na number of areas of concern to students, for example academic affairs, athletics, external\naffairs or welfare and is required to research and distribute information in these areas.\nDeputy President. The revamped Deputy President's job description was designed to\nremove much of the tedium from this position, but unfortunately was unsuccessful. In\ntheory, the DP is responsible for the financial side of the Union, Union security and discipline,\nrepresenting the Union on a number of College committees and chairing a number of Union\ncommittees. Like the President, the DP is supposed to take up two areas of responsibility\non student matters.\nHonorary Secretary (Events). The Hon Sec (Events) is responsible for organising anything\nthat can be classed as a Union event. This involves liaison with Rag and Ents and the\norganisation of Freshers' Fair, Commemoration Ball, et cetera. The Hon Sec also acts as\nthe Returning Officer and is responsible for producing and distributing publicity for Union\nGeneral Meetings and other Union events.\nFELIX Editor and Print Unit Manager. The FELIX Editor is responsible for the production\nof FELIX and the management of the Print Unit. The job is the toughest of the four\nsabbaticals and anyone thinking of standing for this post ought to go and see a doctor\nimmediately.\nElection Timetable\nPapers up 13th February\nPapers down 24th February\nHustings at IC 2nd March (1pm) Hustings at St Mary's27 th February (evening)\nVoting in departments 6th and 7th March\nResults UGM 9th March\nPublicity\nSabbatical candidates should come and see me before Wednesday next week to discuss\ntheir publicity requirements. The publicity budget this year has been set at \u00a380 which should\nallow for the production of two sets of posters and a double-sided A4 leaflet.\nWe will be printing election publicity on 20th and 21st Feb and all artwork for printing\nmust be completed before these dates. I will be available to assist with election publicity\non the 13th,14 th, and 17th of Feb. In addition candidates will be able to book time on\nthe weekend of the 18th and 19th of Feb when they will be guaranteed complete privacy\nwithin the FELIX Office.\nAny candidates requiring typesetting should hand copy in by 17th Feb at 10.00am at\nthe latest.\nManifestos. Copy for the manifesto's issue of FELIX should be submitted by Monday 20th Feb at 10.00am, accompanied by a photograph if you wish one to be printed. Late\nmanifestos will not be accepted.\nManifestos should be submitted on a single side of A4 and should be hand written or\ndouble-spaced. A maximum of 300 words will be allowed; overlong manifestos will be\ncut at the 300th word. Candidates will not be allowed to proof-read their own manifestos,\nbut FELIX staff will ensure that they are printed exactly as written.\nCredits\nIt's been a sleepless week. A thousand and one thankyou's to Steve Meyfroidt for designing the cover,\nToilet Editor Sez Wilkinson, Dev for the Valentine's page, Simon Bredshaw, Dave Thomas, Robin Davison,\nDavid Smedley, Ramin Nakisa, Doug King, Wendy Kite, Andy Bannister, Jason Lander, Paul Barton, Andy\nGarside, Yve Posner, Andy Waller, Adam Harrington, Mike Dalton, Sumit Guha, Andy Clarke, Wouter van\nHulten, Liz Warren, Jen Hardy Smith for being mother.

    "content": "Welfare\nThis is welfare\nby your Welfare Advisor, Yve Posner\nMiami Beach\ncoast, and there are several cinemas,\na red light area (surprise, surprise)\nand a McDonalds.\nAs such, this provides a more\nconventional resort. It is a sun-worshippers paradise and centre for\nlocal excursions. We took several\nand lazed around the pool for the\nrest of the time.\nKey West. This is the southernmost tip of Continental\nUSA. Actually it is an island and I can't understand how it qualifies.\nIt's extremely pretty and some of the\nbuildings date back almost a hundred years. You quickly learn\nthat anything dated earlier than the\nsecond world war is regarded as\nantique and so such history as exists\nin Key West is proudly manifest.\nAfter taking pictures at the monument, with Hurricane Gilbert\n200 miles away in the background\nwe went to the US Mail Office. The\nteller refused to sell stamps for\nBritain. The postal strike was on and\nhe seemed convinced that our\npostcards would be burned and\ndidn't want me to blame him when\nthey were. Does anybody understand this?\nThe Everglades. Imagine an area\nof land,2188 square miles,\ncompletely covered with long grass\nand water. Sound boring? It is. For\na fee you can get out amongst all the\ngrass in an air boat, see a few\nalligators swimming around, and\nwait politely for it all to end. The\ngators would have been interesting\nbut we'd seen them earlier,\nwrestling with some native Indians.\nI joined in, shouted 'handbag!' at\none then grabbed it while it\ncowered. Okay, the Indian caught\na baby, taped its mouth up and\npassed it to me. Same thing. The\nIndians themselves proved to be the\nmost pleasant people we met, even\ncompared to the Disney clones.\nOur remaining week was filled\nspontaneously. A day trip around\nMiami was spoiled only by the\npromise of Don Johnson, who did\nnot appear. We did see J F Kennedy's flame for eternal peace,\nwhich was out, and wandered\naround Coral Gables and Bayside,\nwhere much of Miami Vice is\nfilmed. It all looks as pretty and\nexpensive as the television series\nmakes it seem.\nThe nightlife of Miami exists\nmostly in an area called\n'Downtown'. This is also where\nmost of the people in the world get\nmugged and it is so far from Miami\nBeach that it is difficult to reach\nanyway, even if you want to get\nyour throat cut. We were forced to\nspend the evenings at a cinema or\neating take away pizzas in the hotel\nroom, watching TV. On the last day, the Dolphins\nplayed home to Green Bay Packers,\nand in the glory of Joe Robbie\nStadium we saw the Packers get\nstuffed, ate hot dogs and caught\nsunburn. A fitting end to a fortnight\nof alternative entertainment.\nAmerica\nThe only generalisation which can\nbe made about America is that it\ncannot be generalised. It would be\nunfair to do so on the basis of a holiday in Florida anyway. A country this large (there are only\nthree in the known universe which\nare bigger) must by nature be\nimmensely diverse or terribly\nmonotonous, and while bits are\nundoubtedly flat and boring (the\nEverglades, Salt Lake) most is not.\nThe best guide to most countries,\nat least in terms of culture and\nsociety, is television. Being in Rome\n(as the saying goes) we swallowed\nhuge quantities of this medium. It\nprovided a confused, overbearing\nand mixed bag of goodies,\nentertainment with an identity\ncrisis. This confirmed my suspicions\nthat nobody can really explain what\na typical American is, least of all\nthemselves.\nIn many ways though the States\nis similar to Britain. Far more\nexpensive in some situations, much\ncheaper in others. While I cannot tell\nyou the best place to go for a holiday, you could do much worse\nthan Florida.\nAndy Clarke This year Imperial College Students'\nUnion has made welfare a high\npriority. Mark Fisher, Physics 2,\ntook on the job of Union Welfare\nOfficer in late October 1988 and the\nUnion has also appointed a full-time\nWelfare Advisor, Yve Posner, who\njoined the College in January.\nWelfare covers a wide variety of\nsubjects but during the Week\n13th17 th February the emphasis\nwill be on Welfare Rights in the\nareas of benefits, housing and\nimmigration.\nEvery year millions of pounds ol\nWelfare Benefit goes unclaimed b v all sectors of the population. Some\npeople are too proud to claim, many\nare put off by the bureaucracy of\nclaiming and others just do not\nrealise what their rights are.\nTherefore part of this campaign is to\nraise awareness of Welfare Benefits\nand to encourage students to claim\nwhat is theirs by right.\nA handout has been produced\noutlining the benefits which some\nor all students can claim. These will\nbe available at various places\nthroughout the College. The benefits covered include.\nHousing Benefit\nIncome Support\nHealth Benefits\nFamily Credit\nChild Benefit\nDisability Benefit\nIn addition to this, various\nspecialists will be available during\nlunchtimes in the JCR to answer\nquestions (for details see below).\nHousing, of course, is one of the\nmajor problems faced by students.\nNot only is it difficult to find\naccommodation but it is also\nexpensive and many people are at\nthe mercy of unscrupulous landlords.\nIf you want to find out more about\nyour rights as a tenant, then come\nalong and speak to the s pea cia lists. Imperial College has over 1,100\nOverseas students who face\nadditional problems. Many students\nfrom abroad have only limited leave\nto enter the country and may\n< ; i counter difficulties if they need to\nvary this leave or extend its duration\ntor any reason. There are also\nrestrictions regarding rights to\nbenefits for many overseas students.\nThe United Kingdom Council for\nOverseas Students Affairs( UKCOSA) is an organisation set up\nto promote and protect the interests\nof overseas students. It provides\nadvice, training publications\nconcerning the issues faced daily by\nstudents from abroad. On February\n16 1989 a representative from\nUK COSA will be available to\nanswer queries.\nThere are, of course, many other\nsituations which arise when it's important to know one's rights. For\nexample what happens if your new\nWalkman chews up its first tape,\nyou find a slug in your lettuce or\nyour next door neighbour keeps you\nawake all night with loud music?\nThese are some of the other areas\n'Benefits and Rights Week' aims to\naddress. The Union Welfare\nAdvisor and other Benefits/Rights\nspecialists will be available to\nanswer your questions so it's up to\nyou to exercise your rights and come\nto see them.\nWELFARE '89\nBENEFITS & RIGHTS WEEK\nFebruary 13th17 th Representatives from advice agencies, local councils and DSS will\nbe available in the JCR 14th17 th Feb, 11.45am2.30 pm Tuesday14 DSS External Services Officer (will deal with queries regarding DSS\nbenefits/procedures)\nWestminster Council Housing Benefit Officer (to answer questions on Housing\nBenefit)\nImperial College Welfare Advisor (to answer queries on all types of benefits/rights\nissues)\nWednesday15 DSS External Services Officer\nWestminster Council Housing Benefit Officer\nImperial College Welfare Advisor\nHammersmith Council Tenancy Relations Officer {will answer queries regarding\nprivate tenants rights, new Housing Act)\nThursday16 DSS External Services Officer\nAdvisor from UKCOSA (United Kingdom Council for Overseas Students Affairs-will\nanswer queries regarding immigration, rights to benefits, etc)\nRepresentative from Fulham Law Centre will answer queries regarding law centres\nand help they can provide)\nFriday 1\n7 Advisor from Kensington CAB Citizen's Advice Bureau will answer benefits/rights\nqueries and ex palin work CAB does)\nHammersmith Council Tenancy Relations Officer\nPage 8 FELIX February 10 1989\n\n"

Yet never before\nhave I encountered such difficulty\nin ordering a Big Mac (without large\nfries, thank-you) as the time I entered the McDonald's at 71st and\nCollins, Miami Beach, Fla. The\nproblem was the different language\nwhich we share.\nThis turned out to be a recurrent\ntrouble. I could speak American\nquite well, but that didn't seem to\nbe enough. The natives are from\nsuch diverse backgrounds and races\nthat the title 'American' becomes\nhideously meaningless. But I don't intend to tackle the historical\ndevelopment of the US of A, nor the\nsoci a logical implications of a mixed\npopulation.\nThis is the story of a simple\nholiday which began a week or so\nearlier at three a.m. in the departure\nlounge of Gatwick Airport. This is\nthe first thing you must know about\nthe United States\u2014it is so far away\nthat you have to fly to get there. You\nalso need to fill in a little pink form\nexplaining who you are and why\nyou never got an entry visa,\notherwise the US immigration will\nstop you going to your hotel, or in\nfact anywhere. Few people at\nGatwick seem to know of this and\nso our holiday kicked off with a couple of hours of pitiful gibbering\nand weeping, fearful of refusal at\nthe entry gate.\nSoon we were up though, and\nonly eight hours later we were\ndown again. A brisk walk through\nMiami Airport to our internal flight,\non which nobody had bothered to\nreserve seats for us, and we were up\nagain. Florida itself is 400 miles long\nand can be covered by a short hop\non a plane. You see, America is big.\nSo big that anything further than the\ndrugstore at the end of the street is\nusually reached by automobile, and\nquite often by plane.\nWe took off in glorious sunshine,\n(Miami was at 90 degrees), and\nlanded in torrential rain, (Orlando\nwas at only 86). Florida is known as\nthe Sunshine State, and it just can't be anything more than a tourism\nploy because it rained for three days\nNigel, Chas, Wendy and Bill\nwithout a break. When the sun\ncame out (and it didn't rain again for\nthe next twelve days) the\ntemperature soared and we could\nonly pray for more rain to cool us\ndown.\nOrlando\nEveryone knows of Orlando, if not\nby name then by the endless list of\nentertainments there. This really is\nthe Vacation Capital of the World,\nno kidding. There are so many\nplaces to go that you have to plan\nyour time very carefully, or else\nmove there. Our bus driver (who we\nforgot to tip) claimed an acre of land\ncan be bought, built on, and the\nhouse fully furnished for only\n$90,000. It is almost cheaper to\nemigrate than to rent a room in Southside all year. Hence three\nquarters of the State population are\nnot native Floridians. Hence also\neveryone can afford lots of land, and\neven the things which are close\ntogether are far apart.\nYou need a car. Everybody has\none in America, from second grade\nupwards it seems. Ours was provided by a friend who was out\nthere, and we remain forever\ngrateful to him for all the running\naround he did.\nDay One. We went to Spaceport\nUSA. This is the main Earth\nterminal for all manner of\ninterplanetary, interstellar and intergalactic flight. It is also possible\nto take a bus tour around Kennedy\nSpace Centre, out to the launch pad\nwhere Discovery was quietly sitting,\nall wrapped up in a giant space-shuttle cosy. Most of this is free, or\ncheap, and it is all inside too, so\nwhen it's teeming down outside this\nis an ideal and very interesting place\nto go. We met a spaceman although\nmy friend Neil thought he was only\nan actor.\nDays Two, Three and Four. Walt\nDisney World. Step into the Magic\nKingdom and you enter two hundred and fifty acres of pure\namusement park. A multitude of\nrides, restaurants and gift shops\ncrammed with Roger Rabbit\nparaphernalia. A short monorail trip\naway is EPCOT, two hundred and\nfifty acres of definitive crowd\ncontrol. This is split roughly three\nways also as above.

The bay is only four\nfeet deep, so we were told, but to\nthis day I remain dubious about\nthat. The beach is famous and has\ncome to prominence through several cameo performances in a number of movies and of course\nMiami Vice.
