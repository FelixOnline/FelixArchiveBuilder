    "content": "10 MUSIC 5 May 1998\nALBUMS vj THE JESUS AND MARY CHAIN\nMunki * *\nCheer up, lads.\nT he Jesus And Mary Chain\nused to be very, very famous.\nFrom the beautiful beginnings\nof Some Candy Talking, one of the\nmost unforgettable songs of the\neighties, the JfkMC looked set to\ntake over from the Smiths as the\nstaple student band. Surprisingly\nthey failed, and the band soon fell\naway from the public eye.\nHowever, as if by magic in 1994\nthey reappeared with one of the\nbest and most controversial songs\nof that year, Reverence. Suddenly\nthe phrase 'I wanna die just like\nJesus Christ, I wanna die on a bed\nof spikes' was being sung by all\ncomers at every respectable student disco across the land. Then,\nas if fifteen minutes of fame was all\nthe J& JV1C were allowed at any one\ntime, they slipped into oblivion.\nBut hey, they're back again with\na new line up, including bassist Phil\nKing, formerly of Lush, and this\ntime they say they're back for\ngood. But the question is; are they\nin any position to challenge current\nkings of student-pop The Verve and\nRadiohead? Sadly no; and even\nmore sadly, they are absolutely\nmiles behind. The sound of Munki\nrarely exceeds the limits of aver-age, and although there are a few\nmoments of brilliance, the album\nby no means lives up to the expectation that one might have of it.\nThe recent single Cracking Up\nwasn't so bad, but no so bad is not\nwhat I want from the J& JV1C and\nMunki is therefore a massive disappointment. However a couple of\nthe tracks are very good and one\nnamed Never Understood, with the\nsuper lyric 'everybody hates a pre s ident, everybody loves a queen',\nmay just be good enough to provide the JfkMC with another short\nand sweet fifteen minutes of fame.\nH James\nSILVERBULLIT\nSilverbullit \u2022 *\nI think someone out there is having a laugh. Not since the terrifyingly coif feu red Rocket from\nthe Crypt have a band tried to do something like this. That they're\ndoomed to fail seems to be the\nonly reason they've gotten this far\nas I can't believe anyone would\nhave paid for this band to record if\nthey thought this was anything but\nan April Fool's joke.\nIt actually isn't as bad as I 've\nmade out as there are instances\nwhen it all sounds very Hendrixe s que( but fuzzier) as on the\nstand-out track Boots. If nothing\nelse these boys have at least put a lot of energy into the songs;\nthough they sound as if they might\nhave done everything in one session and are fairly knacker ed by the\nend of the album, about to collapse due to pure exhaustion.\nErm, I really can't say much\nelse as I haven't really got anything\nelse left to talk about. Your dad\nmight like this. CI\nMartin\nSINGLES Therapy? - Lonely, Cryin'\nStarts off with an answering machine message\nthat is on the un welcoming side, 'Leave a mes-sage, or leave me alone'. The song crashes\nalong with frantic punk-poppi ness only lasting a typically brief 2\"2 minutes. It is catchy but in the\nend pretty dull.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON1 Manbreak - Round and Round\nOh yes, this is fantastic. The simple but superior\nbass line lifts the semi-shout-along lyrics that has\nthe lead singer sounding uncannily similar to ex-Stuffie Miles Hunt. There were a frightening ten\nmixes of this track on the CD and although they\nadmittedly sound very similar, the best of the lot\nhas to be the Brown and Sloppy Bassadelik mix.\nJepp - Parsons Green\nThis does not appeal. Her voice is nasal and the\nsong just drifts straight in, carried along by bland\nacoustic strumming, and straight out without a flicker of mem or ability. Shed Seven - Heroes\nIt has got the swaying gait that will probably\nmake it a good old sing-along at their gigs and\nyou can imagine the lighters appearing aloft in\nthe air now. Sounds scary. You have to ask yourself what has happened since the hooligan brilliance of She Left Me on a Friday. The forthcoming album does not hold much hope if this\nis the second best track from it.\nLionrock - Scatter and Swing\nThis is the follow up to the intensely catchy Rude\nBoy Rock, though you won't find it on City\nDelirious their excellent second long player. This\nis up there on the same dance able level as Rude\nBoy... though it not quite as catchy. Definite\nsummer vibes.\nEvil Superstars - It's a Sad Sad Planet\nVery similar to Ben Folds Five minus the piano\nand exuding a summery ex cube ran ce despite\nthe morbid title. Calling this song annoying is an\nunderstatement and it gets worse as the backing\nharmonies echo 'sad sad', totally destroying the\nchorus.\nThe |es us and Mary Chain - i love rock and roll After the detour from their trademark sound\nwith Cracking Up they've released a very typically thrashed out grinding guitar song. But hang\non, did I hear some trumpets in there? I'm afraid\neven adding trumpets does not help to lift this\ntrack up very far.\nJason\nGarbage - Push It\nThere's no way you haven't heard this one yet if\nyou listen to the radio. Great beat and bass, with\nShirley Manson giving another outstanding per-form ance. Mover - Classic No.9\nThis is a50s sounding indie guitar band, if their\ncan be such a thing, and it works well. The lead\nsinger needs a bit of work but the song's already\nthere.\nDarren Day - How Can I Be Sure\nThis blew me away. I was expecting Cliff Richard\nbut the guitars kicked in and I realised this was\nheavy rock. Day then rages through the song.\nThis song is Metallica but better.\nAgnes - Hole In My Head\nThe first decent female lead indie band for quite\nsome a while. Even though this song sounds\ntypical, it is strong in all parts and might be a band to watch for in the future.\nTHE ESSENTIAL CHOON2 Headswim - Better Made\nThe passion the singer puts into the chorus has\nnot been seen since the Longpigs. Even better\nthan their last single Tourniquet and all about\nfeeling bad for what you've done after a drunken night. Hits the nail on the head.\nSimple Minds - War Babies\nI almost thought this was U2 from its start, but\nof course without the class. The song then just\ngoes downhill to the limp chorus. Simple Minds\nfans will find this a disappointing return.\nSymposium - Bury You\nA return for the boys based on the theory that\nsinging a weak melody and then going sch itz makes good music. Sadly it doesn't. CI\nDisco Stu\n\n"

    "content": "NEWS 5 May 1998\nWhite Star to\nbecome Black Hole?\nJONATHAN TROUT\nAustralian astronomers may\nbe witnessing something that has\nnever been seen\nbefore; the birth of\na black hole from\nthe collapsing core\nof a super-massive\nstar.\nA spectacular\nfireball in the nearby\nESO 184-82 galaxy is\nbeing studied at the\nMount Stromlo Observatory near\nCanberra, after an\nItalian / Dutch owned satellite picked up an\nenigmatic ' gamma ray burst er1 an enormous blast of\ngamma rays that appear at random\non ds. They are a possible signal for\nthe birth of a black hole. NASA\nannounced that\nthe GRB971214 observed in\nDecember1997 was the \" most powerful explosion\nsince the Big\nBang\", but this latest event, GRB\n9 8 0 4 2 5 , could end\nup to be even more\npowerful. It is\nalmost certain that\nthe creation of the\nblack hole and the\nsight of the supernova are manifestations of the same\nGalaxy ESO 184-82 is the\n\"smudge\" at the centre of\nthe picture; the bright spot\nin the galaxy is the supernova of a star approximately 100 times more\nmassive than our sun.\nPhoto: Dr Mike Begam event, and what\nmakes it so special\nis that the explosion is a 'mere' 100\nmillion light years away, allowing\nand usually last for only a few sec- unprecedented study access.\nLS Editor Resigns\nJEREMY THOMSON\nThe editor of London Studentthe cross-campus newspaper\nproduced by the University of\nLondon Union - has resigned\nunder considerable financial\npressure.\nJohn Handelaar, who had been\non unpaid leave for over a month,\nreceived a letter from the UL U council GMC, stating that unless he\ncould prove otherwise, London Student was broke and his wages\nwould be stopped. He responded\nshortly before the deadline given in\nthe GMC ultimatum, tendering his\nresignation.\nLondon Student's financial\nproblems were seeded at the\nbeginning of the year, when Handelaar failed to secure a con tract with an advertising agency to\nguarantee revenue for the new spa per. Coupled with an ambitious\nnew weekly full-colour format, this\ncaused serious cash flow problems. By the spring term, a con tract had been signed with agents\nMarot & Co, but failed to bring in\nas much revenue as hoped. The\nproblem was worsened by the edi-tor's failure to invoice customers,\neventually leading to bankruptcy\nfor the publication. Jo Paice, Vice\nPresident for Finance and Services\nat UL U, claimed that Handelaar\nwas \"very late with invoicing, which\nwas why the situation got so bad\nso quickly.\" London Student's editor elect, Tom Belton, also claimed\nthat John had \"balls ed up\" the\nadvertising and left the newspaper\nwith just 9 7 p in the bank.\nThe reasons for John's absence\nare not clear. Jo Paice claimed to\n\"have no idea\" why he was away,\nthough conceded that they could\nhave missed each other. However\nTom Belton, attempting to visit last\nweek, found \"the lights off and a padlock on the door.\"\nIt is highly unlikely that any\nmore issues of the paper will be\npublished this year. The most\nrecent copy is dated 20 March and\nis available only on the web site as\nprinting was blocked by UL U due to\nthe cost. However, John Handelaar\nhas apparently offered to 'help out'\nwith any further attempts to publish the London Student, and with\nthe annual UL U handbook, the\nESG. In reality, this job may well be\nundertaken by Rob Clark, ICU's Deputy President (Finance and\nServices), elected to replace Jo\nPaice next academic year.\nJohn Handelaar is twenty-two.\nNews in Brief...\nSUMMER BALL\nSOLD OUT\nAll of the 1 150 tickets for the\nsummer ball have been sold this\nweek as students flocked to beat\nthe deadline. Sales peaked at over\ntwo hundred places per day on\nTuesday this week as the organisers held an emergency meeting to\ntry to increase capacity. \" We never expected to sell this many\n[tickets]\", student organiser Will\nSmith told Felix, \"there's been a massive demand it's great.\"\nCapacity is officially set at 2 0 0 0 ,\nbut the addition of dodge ms and\na laser quest and limiting seating\nto ten per table has brought the\ntotal down. The committee were also able\nto confirm the attendance of\nJohnny Ball as an after-dinner\nspeaker.\nUNIVERSE '98\nDance music fans have been left\nin confusion this month following\nthe cancellation of Universe98,\nUniverse's outdoor music festival\nscheduled for 23/24 May. The\nexact reason for cancellation is\nunclear, but could be due to poor\nticket sales. Universe have also\nrecently been involved in a legal\ndispute with the Mean Fiddler\nOrganisation, who co promoted previous years' festivals. The dispute centred around ownership of\nthe 'Tribal Gathering' name formerly used for the festival, and\nhas now been settled by an out of\ncourt payment by Universe.\nUniverse sources seem to be\nconfident that the festival will take\nplace later in the year, although it\nmay be smaller than the original\ntwo day event and could be held\nindoors. Universe has been slow\nin producing information concerning the cancellation and ticket\nrefunds, but any updates will be\nreported first by radio 1.\nMore information can be\nfound at www.universe.co.uk or\nby ringing 0 8 3 9 4 4 4 5 7 2 .\nDEATHS IN INDONESIA\nfrom front page\nin gs in an attempt to stop the\nuprising, but failed to prevent a truck and petrol station from being\nset on fire. Thousands more clashed with police in another\nIndonesian city, Yogyakarta, as a wave of anger against the police\naction and President Suharto swept\nthe country.\nThe protests have been a regular occurrence in Indonesia over\nthe last three months, following the\ncollapse of the rupiah and the economic decline of South-East Asia\nover the last year. This is, how ev er, the first time that lethal force\nhas been against the protests. On previous occasions the government has tolerated campus demonstrations, but has refused to\nallow them onto the streets. Earlier\non Tuesday an opposition trade\nunion marched to the International\nMonetary Fund offices to demand that the $43 billion bail-out\nplanned for Indonesia is delayed\nuntil President Suharto commits to\neconomic and political reforms.\nPresident Suharto, aged 76 and\nin bad health, has been in power\nsince 1966 and has been praised\nfor Indonesia's economic growth\nuntil the crisis of last year.\nRecently, however, he has attracted criticism from both inside his\nown country and abroad for failing\nto deliver reforms promised to the\nIndonesian people. The president\nhas said there will be no political\nreforms before 2003, which has\nfurther incited opposition groups,\nincluding many retired military and\npolitical figures.\nIndonesia, with a population of\n200 million, is the fourth largest\nnation in the world, and an important member of the new G15 group of emerging nations. During\nthe protests of the last week\nPresident Suharto has been at the\nG15 summit in Egypt: These latest protests and the manner in\nwhich they were handled can only\nstrengthen opposition calls for him\nto stand down and increase pressure on the international community to take a tough stance with the\naging dictator.\n\n"

    "content": "20 GAMES 15 May1998 OH HH HH... SHUFFLE, SCRAPE, SHUFFLE... OH HH HH. WAR HAMMER : DARK OMEN\nElectronic Arts - Playstaion / PC * * * *\nI did start to like Myths, I honestly\ndid, after battling with the controls\nand grouping command which took ages to master, the poor Al which meant you had to tell your\narchers to stop shooting at your\nown side - it was starting to grow on me. Then along came Dark\nOmen to show it to the door. Dark\nOmen has poorer graphics than\nMyths and its not as pleasing to\nthe ear either, but its everything\nmyths should have been - a much better game.\nIt is a fantasy battle game in\nwhich you play the leader of a mercenary troop who is helping out\nthe local king. You command units\nsuch as infantry, archers, cross-bowmen, assorted dwarven, elf\ntroops and magic users against\nores, goblins and living dead. The major difference between\nMyths and Dark Omen in terms of\nunits is the inclusion of cannon,\ncavalry, and offensive magic. The\nopportunity of horse led charges,\nlong range artillery bombardments\nand wizard fireballs coupled with\nthe ability to quickly select and\nmove units creates a more positive\nfeel on the battlefield. There is also\na quick and simple way of selecting\nand positioning units that are currently off screen - all is needed\nnow is to click on the shield representing the unit on the side of the\nscreen.\nIt's only a shame that the Al is\nnot all that intelligent. The archers,\ncannon and wizards all have a unnerving ability to wipe out half of\na infantry regiment if you send\nthem in to attack the enemy unit\ntargeted. Also, unless you are careful you can select a regiment to\nattack an enemy unit then order it\nto charge, only to watch it hurtle\naway from the enemy because\nyou have not ordered to face in the\ncorrect direction.\nAnnoying glitches aside it is the\nbest of the fantasy battle games\neven if it features a unit that looks\nremarkably like a tank.\nGary Smith\nGAMING NEWS Resident Evil 2 finally arrived in the\nUK last weekend, shifting over\n6 0 , 0 0 0 copies in the first five days\nalone. This easily makes it the\nfastest-selling Playstation game of\nall time, beating the previous\nrecord holder Tomb Raider 2,\nwhich sold 5 2 , 0 0 0 in its first week.\nUnsurprising, then, that videogame\nproducers are so keen on sequels.\nSega will officially announce its\nnext console on May21 st. Codenamed 'Katana' (final name\nstill to be revealed, but unlikely to\nbe Saturn 2) this could be Sega's last chance to claw back a share of\nthe console market from Sony and\nNintendo. Allegedly 10-12 games\nwill be available at launch, sometime in 1999.\nAlthough Playstation owners would probably give their right\narms to have a conversion of\nColdenEye, they will instead be\ntreated to Tomorrow Never Dies,\nin production at Black Ops and\nMGM Interactive. Somehow I don't think it will quite measure up to the\nhit Nintendo 64 game.\nAnd finally, as if one dual analogue joy pad wasn't enough, Sony\nhas released the Dual Shock\nAnalogue Pad which has twin analogue joy pads. However, it also\nincludes a 'shock' feature which\nallows a game to transmit some of\nthe onscreen physical violence\nback to you. The new pad coincides with the European release of\nGran Turisimo.\nSPECIAL REPORT Emulation\nTwo years ago the early versions of\narcade game emulators started to\nappear for the PC. Space invaders\nand pacman and for free, it truly\nwas a generous world. Suddenly it\nwas 1982 all over again; the bright\nflashing screens and loud sounds\ncame flooding back. In those early\nreleases there were only about ten\nor so games supported and they\nhad a nasty tendency to suddenly\ndisplay weird coloured sprites.\nTwo years though is a technological lifetime away, PC's and more\nimportantly the emulation scene\nhas matured out. The old emulator\nscene is one for the history books;\nlong live the reliable 16-bit console\nand arcade emulators. First the 16\nbit game emulators. Before the\nSaturn and Playstation there were\nthe Megadrive and SNES. Both\ntriggered a resurgence in home\ngame machines and quality soft-ware.\nBut these were home machines. The arcade machines\nwere out of reach for all except a chosen few. Now allowing you have the roms most of the arcade\ngames of the I980's can be played\non the PC and it's a damn site easier to change between games compared with swapping arcade\nmotherboards. The big question\nthough is what emulator will run\nthe game you want it to. Mame( Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator)\nis one of the oldest and best-sup-ported arcade emulators. It runs\nwell on a low end Pentium (and\neven on some old 486's) though\nfor some of the later supported\ngames a better Pentium with some\nmemory will give better frame\nrates. Mame is one of simplest\nemulators to use, with a specific\nWindows95/NT port which when\nrun searches for the appropriate\nRoms. Though it generally runs the\nolder arcade roms, Space invaders,\nPacman, and Donkey Kong and its\nclones, it also can run many of the\nmid 80's arcade roms such as\nCommando, Marble Madness, Arkanoid and Tetris. It is also able\nto run the Atari vector based\ngames Asteroids, battle zone and\nstar wars. With about 4 5 0 + possible games it would take ages to get\nbored with this. Mame starts to run\nout of steam when it comes to\ncovering later 80's arcade games.\nFor these games there are still\nemulators but these tend to be dos\nrather than windows based. Also\nbecause of the later 80's idea of\nrunning different arcade games on\nthe same motherboard most of\nthese emulators deal with a family\nof games. Callus the Capcom emulator and System 16, the Sega\nsystem 16 emulator, are good examples of these. Both are well\nbuilt emulators and run roms such\nas super hang-on and outrun, but\ncan be very very slow. A fast\nPentium or Pentium2 system and\nthe frame rate will improve. Also\nshould you want to run the best\never arcade shoot-em-up R type\n(read last months Edge just to see\nits not just my opinion) the emulator to own is RAGE (Real Arcade\nGame Emulator). Unfortunately it is\nprocessor hungry, the hint is to run\nit under pure dos mode, but is\nalmost worth buying a pentium2 system just to increase the frame\nrate. So how do you get hold of\nthese emulators (and the roms - if\nyou own them). Well one of the\nbetter sites is Dave's Videogame\nClassics (http://www.dave s classics. com), this practically is a one-stop shop for emulators. So\nrelive your early days and relive\nthose classics.\nGary Smith\n\n"

    "content": "1 5 May 1998 MUSIC\nTHE ELECTRIC CAFE \u2022 ALBUM REVIEWS MUTANT: DISCO COMPILED BY\nCOLIN DALE Harmless Records\nFURTHER ADVENTURES IN\nTECHNO SOUL - VARIOUS ARTISTS\nPeople who have been\ninvolved in dance music for a number of years seems to be\nreminiscing back to the good old\ndays. The days when house and\ntechno were very much the same thing. Many things have changed\nsince then. With the dance culture\nexplosion came many splinters and\nsub-genres of musical styles.\nTechno became repetitive, mini-mal, sometimes completely funk-less loops. House became hedonistic and mindless, often exploited by\nthe mainstream.\nToday a handful of DJs and\nmusicians are confronting the\nproblem and trying to turn the\nclock back, not in terms of the\nmusic that is being made( that\nwould lead to stag nancy) but the\nattitudes we should have as we lis-ten. Colin Dale's latest album, Mutant : Disco is a tribute to the\nmany artists who are just making\nmusic that they believe in. The\nsleeve contains a fitting message\n\"Don't try to categorise, just lis-ten.\"\nColin Dale is no stranger to\ncompilation albums. His two Outer\nLimits were based on his successful\nKiss FM show and helped to establish his name outside of the London area. The Outer Limits albums were\ndevoted to the more off-the-wall\nand progressive ambient sounds\nthat you can still hear on Colin's show. They were the first contact\nthat many listeners had to some of\nthe most innovative musicians in\nelectronica such as Dan Curtin and\nJuan Atkins.\nColin describes Mutant : Disco\nas \"very much a contrast. The\nOuter Limits was more on a sort of\nhome-listening tip. This is very\nmuch a club by sort of album. House and techno tracks with a disco influence.\"\nThe term disco influence that is\nused by Colin is referring to modern\nclub music that has been influenced\nby disco music. \"Disco music was\nalways about making people\ndance.\" Claims Colin, \"It's not\nmusic you sit and listen to in your\nliving room. On a loud club system,\ndisco music was made for dancing\nto.\"\nThe tracks that have been\nselected by Colin are from a variety\nof different international artists.\nThe French craziness of Versatile\nrecords is represented by l: Cube\n(Metamorphik). Kevin Yost, a rising\nstar from the US who combines live\ninstruments into his rhythmic yet\njazzy deep house has one of his latest tracks for i! Records on this\nalbum (Hypnotic Progression Pt 2).\nCarl Craig's forays into house music\nas Paperclip People are recognised\nwith the use of Paperclip Man. One of Britain's stars of techno, Luke\nSlater has Time Dancer included.\nThere are also some classics on\noffer here. Flash from Fix (aka\nOrlando Voorn) can be found here.\nAs well as the excellent 88 from H+M( Jeff Mills and Robert Hood). The mixing is kept to a minim um. This ensures that the tracks\nare represented as pieces of music\nin their own right, and may be listened to as such. Colin has the\ncourage to show us that these\npieces have a definitive beginning,\nmiddle and end. All in all this album\nmakes for essential listening. If you\nlike your music deliciously funky,\nyet progressive and experimental,\nthen you shouldn't let this one pass\nyou by!\nal;ck\nFerox Records\nLook out for a full explanation\nand feature on Ferox records\nin next week's electric cafe\ncolumn. Until then you just need to\nknow that Ferox Records is the\nbaby of one of the UK's most\ninventive and passionate electronic\nmusicians. The style of the label\ncentres around music made on machines, but fused with human\nqualities; soul, depth, passion and\nlove. Ferox has seen releases incorporating house, techno, funk, hiphop and jazz.\nHere we have the second release in the Ferox compilation\nalbum series. Called Further\nAdventures in Techno Soul, it incorporates tracks from a wide range of\nelectronic artists signed to, or\nfriendly with the Ferox label.\nThe first track is a Russ Gabriel\nremix of the classic At Les, originally by Carl Craig. Russ has released\nan EP under the pseudonym Fusion\non Carl's Planet E label which operates from Detroit, and this was part\nof the exchange between them.\nThe track is very smooth and, I believe a good interpretation of the\noriginal. It can't be easy to remix a piece that is already engraved in\neveryone's hearts. The emphasis\non Russ' reworking is to keep the\nsounds clean and polished. The\njazzy theme is still there in the form\nof some intricate rhythms.\nNew signing Bjom Torske contributes the next track, called Don'f Electric Shock Me. This is a really\nbeautiful piece of music; delicate\nand subtle in its parts yet strongly\noverpowering as a whole. This is\nmusic to dream to!\nOther artists featured are Stasis\n(aka Steve Pickton), Aubrey, Max Brennan and Dan Curtin/Mike Filly.\nAll of the above have contributed\nexcellent pieces; daring and orig i nal. Stasis takes the theme of electro and customizes it to fit within\nhis own abstract yet funky parameters in Express. Aubrey has contributed a typically rhythmic piece\nof funk that isn't in a hurry to get\nanywhere with Blue Lick\\ Max Brennan has created a fine piece of\njazz-house fusion music with Sirius\nat the Pier. Indeed his style and\nlove is to take styles of music and\ngenres of instruments and just\nthrow the whole thing into a big\nmelting pot. Dan Curtin/Mike Filly\nare both already well-respected\nproducers and are a very welcome\naddition to the Ferox collective with\nthis track The Longest Night. Iam really in love with their music. The\nwhole thing starts off real funky and\nseventies, then suddenly breaks\ndown into a delicate string section\nwith bongo rhythms. The piece\nchanges throughout, and never lets\nyou get bored.\nThere is plenty more on offer\nhere. Many more tracks of distinction and quality. You're just going\nto have to listen to them your self.\nWith this amount of space Iam sure that I couldn't do this album\njustice. If you are interested in\nmusic that is rooted in influences\nas far-reaching as jazz, funk, soul\nand hip-hop but is pointing the way\nahead then do not ignore the\nsounds of Ferox and especially\nFurther Adventures in Techno Soul.\nal;ck.\n\n"

    "content": "5 May 1998 ARTS\nTHE INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS THE ICA AND WHY YOU SHOULD GO THERE\n17\nFirst of all, a couple of things\nneed to be cleared up. When1 tell people I went to the ICA,\nmost of them are convinced it has\nsomething to do with our beloved\ncollege, a club or association of\nsome sort. Absolutely not. ICA\nstands for the Institute of\nContemporary Arts, and it happens\nto be one of the most exciting and\ninnovative places in London. All art\nlovers can find their preferred form\nhere: exhibitions, cinema, performance arts, conferences, club\nnights and a brand new media c en tre. There a two exhibitions worth\nwriting about on right now, both\nuntil 24 May. The first and biggest one is\n\"Future Systems\", a group of seven\ndesigners showing recent projects.\nThese people are being tipped as\nthe creators of 21st century land-scape. Some of the projects have\nalready been finished: the Nat West\nmedia centre at Lord's Cricket\nGround, North London and a cou ple of schools in Britain and Germany. The exhibition itself is\nreally well set out. One goes round\n| | pp iMH ri \u00ab dp gaff it each pro-j ect, complimented with pictures.\nThen one tl irn s to the middle of the\nroom to fi rfd two big tables with all\nthe models! It is fascinating looking\nat these. The whole Idea of Future\nSystems Is |o create buildings that\nare energy generating, non-poll ut ing with exciting new shapes. Some\nof these td tally melt into land-scape, such as the house in Wales;\nothers clash with the environment,\nsuch as the Ark building at the Earth\nCentre. But all have an \"organic\"\nlook to them. They also have the\nidea of dividing one building into\nseveral smaller ones: the \"Green\nBird\" is, depending on where one\nstands, either a block of flats or a set of offices. Other projects\ninclude the zero emission developments funded by the European\nCommission of the cities of Berlin,\nToulouse and London. In the comments for the models, one sentence seems to sum up their way of\nworking: \"What our communities\ndemand from us today is a new\nhumanity and architecture. A nature and an enhanced quality of\nlife and on architecture that is soft\nand organic, to enclose the energy\nefficient non polluting technologies\nof the 21 st century.\" This exhibition\nis the opportunity for people like us\nto see and appreciate our future\nenvironment. If this is what it's going to be like, then I can't wait to\nbe there.\nJ The next exhibition is by Sarah\nSze. I will confess that most people\nwill find this just pretentious and\nuseless. Miss Sze has put together\nall sorts of everyday objects (cans,\npencils..) and stuck them all over\nthe ceiling and down some of the\nwalls of the upper gallery. It's extremely amusing and quite fascinating looking at the rows of pencils suddenly interrupted by a matchbox. The colours brighten up\nthe room and the whole installation\nis a celebration of our daily life\nshowing the ups and downs of it. If\nyou have time to spare, this is definitely one of the nicest way to\nspend it.\nFinally a word about the events\nof the ICA this month. As usual,\nthere is some amazing stuff on. At\nthe cinema, there is a retrospect\nof Lars Von Trier's work, (Breaking\nthe Waves), one of the most\nexceptional directors working In\nEurope. There are also some very\ninteresting talks including one by\nSteven Berkoff, and another about\nthe emergence of Asian Culture in\nBritain. The ICA has recently\nopened a new media centre with\nlots of fun things to watch and touch. If you have never been to\nthe ICA, I urge you to go there right\nnow. For more information, Felix\nhas the programmes of events, just\ngo into the office and ask Julia.\nWatch this space-over the next few\nweeks for more about the cutting\nedge art in London. b. The ICA can be found on The\nMall, London SWI, \u00a31.50\nNearest tube: Charing Cross\nANISH KAPOOR\nThe Hayward Gallery\nBefore reviewing this ex hi bi tion, 1 am ashamed to admit\nmy relative ignorance with\nrespect to this fascinating artist.\nDespite the impressive credentials\nof his career, the reclusive Kapoor\nremains distant from the limelight\nof success and media attention.\nBorn in India of Iraqi and Hindi\nparentage, this talented British\nsculptor rose to fame during the\n80s. Representing the nation at the\nprestigious Venice Biennale of\n1990, he gained further acclaim\nwhen awarded the controversial\nTurner prize in 1991. Bluffer's tip: a pair of coveted pieces even adorns\nthe reverent hallway of 10 Downing Street.\nThe current solo event, a singular achievement and honour at the\ntender age of 44, comprises surprisingly recent works, including\nseveral especially commissioned sculptures integrated into the\ngallery's interior structure. Kapoor\nexplores the disturbing interaction\nbetween space and void - elliptical\nswellings extend the confinements\nof rigid walls, funnels plunge the\nobserver into the infinite oblivion of\nshadows, mirrored lenses distort\nthe conventional order of images.\nRegardless of the sexual connotations invariably associated with the\nsensual cavities and sinuous\ncurves, the ambitious collection is\nprimarily a spellbinding journey\nthrough an abstract wonderland.\nThe extraordinary scale of his work\nis highlighted by \"At the Edge of the\nWorld II\", an engulfing crimson dome of gargantuan proportions,\nwhich towers down from the ceiling\nand measures an a we inspiring eight metres in diameter.\nOften considered his stylistic\ntrademark, the monochrome powdered pigment vibrates with tex-ture, bringing the walls and surroundings explosively to life.\nExploiting the qualities of diverse\nmaterials, such as carved natural\nwood, traditional polished stone,\nmoulded translucent alabaster and\nversatile fibreglass, the sculptor\ncreates an enigmatic depth verging\non the boundary of optical illusion.\nUnravelling the mysterious dimensions and puzzling forms is a visual\nchallenge, straining the senses and\noverwhelming the mind.\nVerdict: this important exhibition is both an enlightening and\nuplifting experience, possibly the\nmost exciting and innovative work\nin London at the moment. Helena\nUntil 14th June, \u00a33.50\nTube: Waterloo/Embankment\n\n"

    "content": "5 May 1998 MUSIC 15\nCLUB SCENE ALBUM VOICES OF DRUM l\\T BASS (MILLENNIUM RECORDS)\nRelease Date : 1 st June it ir ir ir \\/z As the title suggests, this\ncompilation focuses on vocal D&B tracks, a rare\nbreed indeed. This album makes no\nbones about trying to be different\nand steer away from the standard\nD&B styles. The reason that this is\nthe first ever vocal drum and bass\ncompilation, is that, in my opinion,\nit is very difficult to make vocal\ndrum and bass tracks that actually\nwork. The few good exceptions\nthat I can think aren't featured\nhere, however.\nI feel that the whole reason\nthat there are so few vocal drum\nand bass tracks is in the roots and\nbackground of the scene. Vocals\nlimit the tunes, and you can\nsay/communicate much more without lyrics.\nA picture speaks a thousand\nwords, as they say, and it's the\nsame with beats, breaks and\natmospheric als.1 have always felt\nthat in electronic/dance music in\ngeneral it's not so much what they\nare saying but more about the\nsound. The voice should be used as\nan additional instrument rather\nthan as part of a story or a full on\nsong.\nThat said, I'm sure this will\nappeal to a more mainstream audi-en ce, who, I'm told, prefer to have\na song with their music no matter\nwhat style it's in. I suppose so they\nhave got something to sing along\nto. There are plenty of good tracks\non this compilation that are only let\ndown by the lyrical content. The\nonly tracks on here that do anything\nfor me are Aphrodite featuring Gail\nMclean, a wicked track, ]u Ju featuring Marsh a in an intelligent style,\nSilverbeam's Weightless and\nNookie's We Can Make It Happen\nThis last track would sound better\nstill if the vocal was shorter.\nThe main difference between\nthese tracks and the rest of the\nalbum is that the tunes use the\nvocal in a different way: as a sound\nto complement the rest of the\ntrack, not so much songs as\nsounds.\nThis is definitely a different\napproach to drum and bass, and\nI'm sure it is just what some people\nhave been waiting for. It'll probably\nhave limited appeal to the underground fraternity.\nJo Public\nYOU'RE READING IC RADIO 0 0\nThe Back Room\nHidden deep in a room in the bowels of\nSouthside lies a room few have heard of and\neven fewer have ever seen. This mysterious cavern vibrates to the sound of a multitude of different sounds, is hosted by a variety of hugely\ntalented Dj's, and yet still remains elusive to the\nuninitiated. Some know it as Southside Disco.\nOnly those who truly have their ears to the\nground and can honestly say they know the\nword on the street recognise it as 'The Back\nRoom'. Why yes, even those kids on that Run\nDMC video can't admit to knowing the score.\nA new age is dawning. Whilst still recognising its roots, this great institution is under radical development. Paint schemes are appearing\nlike messages from the Gods, and new blood is\nbeing introduced to bring this stumbling youth\ninto adulthood. The Electric Cafe has a residency (catch them next on 29 May), and Thursdays\nbrings you a fortnightly rotation of your favourite\ncheesy tunes from disco to indie. Fridays bring\nyou some of the hottest DJing talent in college,\nplaying some of the largest tunes, combined with silky smooth mixing talents. And all this for\nfree- what more could you ask for?\nIf you haven't been before, here are ten reasons why you should come along:\n1. It's totally free (no small print or hidden\nextras)\n2. Drink is cheap, unless you drink Staropramen,\nin which case I'd recommend meth s as a tasty alternative. My personal recommendation is Tennants Extra, purely for its alcohol to\nmoney ratio. At 26p per percent of a pint,\nyou can't say fairer than that, g uv 'nor.\n3. It's closer to home than most other places,\nespecially if you live nearby.\n4. Where else can you go on a Thursday?\n5. There are seats, so when the bar is full you can sit down.6. Read number 2 again.\n7. See rule 6.\nMixing competitions occur occasionally, with anyone welcome to\ntest their vinyl prowess.\nBecause I get lonely in there on my\n10. 'And why not' as David St. Hubbins of Spinal\nTap would say.\nAnd if all those plethora of reasons doesn't persuade you that you must come, then I'm afraid you may be beyond help.\nAnd finally, as a parting thought: you don't have to have a mullet to be a mullet head. C DJ\nWhere It's At\nThis Thursday John, the master of cheese, is\nspinning out his favourite slices of Emmental\n(kids really will do anything for the taste of\nDairy-Lea). Friday sees Tom and Lourie taking\nover the decks for a trip to the heart of the\nLondon sound. The Electric Cafe is taking over\nthe 'Chill Out' room at the Union on the 22nd, and will be stopping off at the Back Room on\nthe following Thursday.\n\n"

    "content": "15 May 1998\nALBUMS MUSIC\nTHE UNBELIEVABLE TRUTH\nAlmost Here [QQ]\nIt's quite shocking that\nUnbelievable Truth actually grab\nyour attention and manage to\nhold onto it. More often than not,\nbands like this tend to drag on and\nbecome repetitive ly boring, leaving\nyou pondering where you left last\nweek's Melody Maker. Almost\nHere is an inspirational debut\nrelease that guides you through the\ndarkness and promises a light at\nthe end of the tunnel. Named after\nHal Hartley's1990 quirky, offbeat\ncult picture, they transmit an intensity of atmosphere that is hard not\nto fall in love with. Andy Yorke\n(brother of Thorn, if you didn't know) has a strong voice which is\ncaptivating, almost hy p not ising. Magical chords float in, through,\nround and out of the gorgeously\nsoaring melodies. The fragile, carefully balanced sound is unique and\ncosi ly familiar.\nRight from the start, the songs\nare constructed with a base of\nthought-provoking lyrics and simple yet rich acoustic tunes, only to\ngo off in a direction of their own.\nOpener and current single. Solved\nmanages to convey the frustration\nof a given problem in a grand and\nepic manner. You're pulled in by\nthe sweeping sympathetic vocals,\n'And it's all I 've got and it's not\nenough.' The following track,\nAngel, builds and rises to the end\nwhere it gloriously pulls all its elements together and the estranged\nlyric, 'If you're gonna live your life\nlike that, it's gonna let you down,'\nfights against the powerful strumming and majestic strings. In fact,\nthere are many climactic lyrics that\nare repeated at the end of a song,\nin order to leave a lasting imp res sion: 'Settle down, you never want\nto see me drown.' (Settle Down);\n'Say what you want. Deliverance\ncan wait.' (Building) and the album\nclosing, Be ready to go.' (Be\nReady)\nThis review may come across\nas an exercise in hyperbole, but\nUnbelievable Truth deserve all the\ncredit they get. Almost Here is an\nentirely engaging and intimate\naffair. It's beautifully performed,\nintelligently crafted, gloriously\ninspirational, emotionally uplifting\nand without parallel. Unbelievably\nspecial and that's the truth.H Dennis\nMONKEY MAFIA\nShoot the Boss \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nArr yo iga at ah lo it, boy? Arr yo iga at al ooo it? W ell after reviewing the\nMafia's last dreary single,\nLong As I Can See The\nLight, I thought the title of the\nalbum was very appropriate. What\nI expected was more of the same\nslow, dull tunes may-be with a few\nnice w izzy effects and uninspired\nfemale vocals. With an ungodly\nfear of what I might have let myself\nin for I put the CD in the player and\npressed play.\nThe first track, Make jah Music\nis lyrically an ode to reggae and\nWest Indian music, a theme continued throughout the album, with\nheavy beats, sliding strings and\nevery kind of electro noise springing out at you. Not bad but at over\nseven minutes long a bit taxing.\nMake jah Music sweeps seamless-ly into Blow the Whole joint Up.\nThis is on another level altogether,\na distant male voice asks all and\nsundry if they are 'ready' in typical\njungle MC style and then it lands\non you like a4001b jerry Springer\nguest, the phat test electro beats\nthis side of the Chemical Brothers.\nAwesome.\nShoot the Boss is a fluid, flowing landscape. At some points you\nfeel as if you are travelling the most\nintense white water ride ever, mayhem going on all around you and at\nother times all you can hear is the\nstars twinkling in the inky blue night\nsky. The twelve tracks on the album\ncan be split into those based\naround vocals and the instrumental\nones, even if they do tend to have\nsampled vocals interweaved into\ntheir very fabric. The true vocal\ntracks tend to detract from Jon\nCarter's magnificent ability to cobble together a corking tune. Work\nMi Body is testament to this. The\nversion on the album is a scathing\nscratch mix courtesy of DJ Krash\nSlaughta with much of Patra's original lyrics removed but those that\nstill remain just annoy and drag the\nfeeling of the tune down. The\ninstrumental tracks tend to be\nsmall excursions of their own. The\nWhore of Babylon starts off with a slow introduction into Arabic tribal\nbeats and builds relentlessly during\nits eight and a half minute play time\ninto a hectic crashing drum n' bass\nnumber.\nShoot the Boss is a brilliant\nalbum, fused images of the\nProdigy, Daft Punk and the\nChemical Brothers all come together under one stoned, Jamaican\ninfluenced Boss. Well done Jon\nCarter. CI\nRamzi\nSIX BY SEVEN\nThe Things We Make \u2022 \u2022\nThe band are the NME's current\nwunder kind, described by them as\nsomething along the lines of\nexperimental post-punk power\nrock, I'd describe them as something completely different - fairly\nnon-de script, keyboard driven\nsonic soundscapes (with 'wi b bly' bits) which add more guitar y bits\nthe more you go through the\nalbum. In fact, I might even chance\na comparison to a blander Pink\nFloyd at times meaning a lot of\nlong (6 - 8 minute) songs mostly.

    "content": "COLUMNS 1 5 May 1998\nSecond only to moaning\nabout the temerity of\ntutors who expect a little\ngraft, accommodation is the major\ngripe of students. While my transition from poacher to gamekeeper\nhas reduced my sympathy for the\nformer, the dire state of cheap\nhousing annoys me as much as the\nnext man. My housing since leaving Linstead has always been less\nthan palatial, with the odd dod gy landlord, but throughout this time,\nI have maintained the utmost\nrespect for the quality of the\nadvice given by the Student\nAccommodation Office. This, of\ncourse, is because I have never\nsought their advice. For the poor\nsods that have had occasion to\nuse this facility, the situation\nwould appear less rosy. In recent\nmonths, the rate of complaints\nabout the SAO has been steadily\nincreasing, far more than I can\nremember in previous years. The\nlong-running saga about staff attitude seems to have subsided, though it is not clear if this has\nbeen resolved. The latest moan, concerning the standard of\naccommodation, is of much greater importance. In this\nrespect, the 'service' is a shambles.\nHaving read the lists and seen\nsome of the properties, one is left\nwondering why anyone bothers (or\nindeed does anyone bother?). As\nJeremy remarked last week, no\nattempt is made to vet the land-lords, which is very puzzling. The\npossible reasons for this are\nnumerous. Does the College give a toss? Are the SAO staff incapable\nof such assess-ment s? Has it\neven occurred to\nanyone that this\nmay be a good idea? Yet again, it\ndisplays the woe ful shortage of\nmanagement savvy that so cripples our non-aca-demi c activities.\nIt is painfully\nobvious, surely,\nthat College is in\na position to select and monitor\nthose that appear on its list, since\nthey are providing a supply of (rea-son ably) reliable tenants with a pretty much guaranteed income\nstream for fixed periods of the\nyear. Supply and demand will\nalways ensure that landlords\nwould have their pick of can di dates. Secondly, it does not take\nthe Dearing Committee to identify\nCD CO\nCo \u00a3\nin\na correlation between a student's ability to study and the accommodation in which they live.\nAdditionally, the provision of\nCollege-approved, decent private\naccommodation would be a good selling point for the College;\naccommodation has always been\nthis place's Achilles' heal. The current situation\ncannot be\nallowed to continue, particularly in the light of\nthe mergers.\nEither the SAO should wake up\nto its responsibilities and the\nopportunities to\nachieve them, or\nit should be\nheavily ratio-nal is ed so that it\nCollege rooms,\nwith much of its role in allocating\naccommodation transferred to the\nRegistry, where rooms could be\nallocated alongside places. The\nCollege's aim to \"improve students'\nsocial areas\", trumpeted in this\nweek's IC Distorter, would be as ham if sleeping areas were\nignored.\ndeals only with\nIt seems those cheeky Felix\nphotographers have been making\na nuisance of themselves again. It\nappears that one of them has been\nattempting to take a picture of the\nRetail Catering Manager's door,\nmuch to the chagrin of Catering\nsupremo, John Foster. All very\nstrange. Why this door? Does this\noffice house Catering dark secrets?\nIs this where Michelin-starred\nchefs slave over the Linstead\nmenus? Or is it because Catering\nspent \u00a31 1 7.50 on the little sign on\nthe door that announces the\noffice's owner? Frankly, ladies and\ngentlemen, it's a mystery.\nFinally, this weekend sees the\nyear's most important football fix-ture, on which the hopes and\ndreams of millions rest. I refer, of\ncourse, to the annual Southside vs\nICU Bar game. Heretical to the\nlast, and in keeping with Felix's independence, my money is on\nSouthside. Aside from the vastly\nsuperior post-match refreshment,\nthe Prince's Gardens mob have a good track record. That said, the\nUnion boys should not be underestimated on the field of play. When\nit comes to boat racing, however...\nTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nMeditation and Cigarettes\nResident Evil two has been causing Our Kid some problems with\nhis revision. Somewhere out\nthere is a cigarette with\nPlay Station written on it...\nPeople who never go out are\nweird, aren't they? Society\nstates implicitly that it is far\nmore healthy to be down the pub,\nslugging down our tenth pint of\nbrain-cell killing, liver-rotting\nCarling Premier, than sitting alone\nfor six hours in front of the television playing Resident Evil 2 (which,\nincidentally, is what I have been\ndoing today... ahem). Why? Well,\nthere can be no doubt that social is ing is regarded by many as the raison d'e tre, the spice that life has to\noffer; it is more enjoyable than\nwork, more fulfilling than solo pur-suits, and more meaningful than\n\"forty-two\".\nBut is this the case? It is certainly a widely upheld belief in the\nWest, where the clich e that is the\nbusiness world demands that we\nbehave in this manner. In the East,\nthough, where they seem to have\ntheir psyches far more sorted,\nthere exists yoga, Buddhism, transcendental meditation... You've\ntried it? Oh, you haven't? Stop\nmoaning that your exams are not\ngoing right, then.\nPursuits such as transcendental\nmeditation have countless benefits;\nI'm no expert, but regular practitioners of meditation enjoy lower\nheart rates and blood pressure,\nreduced stress, greater concentration and focus, and, after some\npractice, experience of so-called\n\"higher states of consciousness\"\n(which, by the way, have a far more\nsalubrious and therapeutic effect\nthan listening to Josh Wink at two\nhundred Watts).\nAlthough this orgy of focused\nthought might be regarded as an\nextreme by some, practicing concentration throughout everyday life\ncan certainly be beneficial. One exercise mentioned at the start of a book 1 once read on Zen meditative\ntechniques suggests that a good workout for the mind involves saying to oneself, whenever a task is\nbegun, that \"This is the only thing\nworth doing\". This was included in\nthe book merely as a method of\npreparing the mind before the student learns meditation properly,\nbut it will improve your concentration even if you do not want to \"go\nthe whole hog\".\nThis leads me on to a little trick\nof self-contemplation of my own devising (please, autographs later).\nUnfortunately it involves smoking\ncigarettes (so if you don't smoke,\nmake sure you start tomorrow).\nBuy a packet of your favourite\nstinking cancer sticks (mild ones,\npreferably), and write upon each\none some event that has taken\nplace in your life, or a significant\nperson in your life, or whatever you\nfeel like considering. Over the five\nminutes or so it takes to smoke\neach one, think hard about what is\nwritten on the fag, how it changed\nyour life, the good points, the bad\npoints. Mull it all over, and try to\ndraw conclusions from it that could\nlead to self improvement. Who\nknows, you might end up a better\nperson. Or you might end up dying\nfrom lung cancer... perhaps this\nwasn't such a good idea after all.\nRight, I'm off for fifteen minutes\nmeditation; swimming though the\nether until Iam at total peace with\nmyself, my friends, and the world.\nOr maybe I'm going to have one\nmore go at brutally butchering that\npesky, pixel late d, playstation\nzombie.\nAli Campbell\n\n"

His roles in Driving Miss\nDaisy, Glory and most notably as\nElis Boyd \"Red\" Redding in the\nShawshank Redemption (one of\nthe best films of the decade) won\nwidespread critical acclaim.\nThis is particularly impressive\nfor someone who found stardom\nso late in life.

    "content": "12 MUSIC 5 May 1998\nCOLIN DALE INTERVIEW the M^c t rh c/c$ fie\nAnyone who follows the more underground strains of electronic music will at\nleast have heard or read the name Colin\nDale. Most should be quite familiar with this\npersonality. They will have danced to his skillful\nblending of techno and house in some of the\nworld's most exciting dance clubs, they will have\nlistened to his revolutionary and ground-break-ing radio show called the Abstrakt Dance which\nappears every week on Kiss FM, or they will\nhave possibly bought one of the releases on\nhis own record label, also called Abstrakt\nDance.\n1 must confess that Colin Dale is one of\nthe main reasons that Iam DJing today; both\non the radio and in clubs. His ability to communicate very avant-garde and, for want of a better word, unpopular (in the sense that the\nelectronica he played was never mainstream)\nmusic as something that was creative, individual and fresh certainly broke down my fears of\nlistening to music that WASN'T made to be\nmarketed and that WAS produced with the\npassion of sound and music in mind . Of course my musical taste has developed separately since 1 started my own radio projects,\nbut I definitely got the courage to go out and\nsearch for the music I wanted to listen to from\nColin.\nAfter his problems with new central-heat-ing systems and food poisoning and many\nfrayed nerves on my part (even big-name DJs\ncan have mundane problems like the rest of us!!)\nI finally got my chance to meet the man himself.\nI would describe Colin as no different to how I find him on the radio; laid-back, down-to-earth.\nDon't be deceived though! This gentle and soft-spoken ambassador of techno can rock the\nhouse when he wants to!\nIn this age of mass categorization and I was\ncurious to know how Colin would describe his\nmusical style. \"I describe the music I play essentially as techno music. In saying techno 1 don't mean it's just thump-thump-thump all night,\nbecause unfortunately that's the type of name\nthat a lot of people put to techno. I like to play\nmore subtle techno and music that's crossed with\nhouse and maybe even funk and bits of jazz\nthrown in there as well. That's club wise. On the\nradio it's more broad and open. I play everything\nfrom ambient right through to quite hard techno.\"\nColin is quite modest and down-to-earth\nwhen asked about how he initially started in\ndance music. He claims that many of the opportunities that came his way passed by luck. There\nare no tall stories about his natural talent and all\nthe DJs and stars he hung out with. One of his\nmost endearing qualities is that he seems constantly surprised that people respect him so,\nand that he has got to where he is today. \"I was\nworking for a bank actually, which gave me loads\nof money to go clubbing. I started going to Tim\nWestwood' s club and I'd say I was a dancer ini-ti ally. That'show I got into clubs. It was Tim that\ngave me my first break and it just sort of went\nfrom there. I was very very lucky. I fell into Kiss\nFM when they were pirates and were actually\ni oo king for DJs to do shows. So I guess I 've been\nvery lucky with the whole thing.\"\nThe Abstrakt Dance radio show has helped\nColin make a name for himself in the London\nscene, and has earned him enormous international respect from the \"electronic community\"\nworldwide. Despite playing four-four dance\nmusic, Colin justifies the use of the Abstrakt tag.\n\" What I wanted to do with the whole thing was\nrun just left or right of what was happening currently in the clubs. It was a slight alternative,\nmaybe a twist, on what was happening in\nLondon. When I listen to electronic music I can\nhear funk in there. I can hear jazz; all types of\ninfluences that other people wouldn't hear.\nThat's why it's called Abstrakt Dance.\"\nHowever he does insist on keeping up with\nthe pace of electronic music that is created simply to push forward barriers and keep music\nprogressive, experimental and off the wall.. This\nportion of the Abstrakt Dance is called the Outer\nLimits. Colin describes the style as \"sounds that\npeople wouldn't hear on the radio usually. I could have taken an easier route where 1 would\nhave done a commercial show on Kiss.\" he con-tin u es, \"But I didn't want to do that, and I'm lucky that people respected me for that.\"\n1 ask Colin where he gets his inspiration from\nin terms of mixing and choosing music. Is it from\nhis busy international agenda, or his home-based radio shows? \"Clubwise it's really good because I 've been really lucky to travel the whole\nworld and play in different clubs and see different cultures. I find that the most inspiring aspect\nof club DJing. To be totally honest I don't really\nget much inspiration from outside radio-wise.\nWhat I normally do is play tunes to people that\nI would like to hear on the radio myself. I get my\nfeedback mostly from the producer at Kiss, and\nalso from speaking to people like yourself.\nThings that you are doing in your radio show I find very interesting and inspiring as well.\"\nAlongside playing music, Colin has also\nstarted promoting and spreading it with his own label, Abstrakt Dance. Our conversation moves\nonto the state of the dance music scene.\nAnyone who goes out and buys records, from a bedroom enthusiast to a top international DJ,\nwill know that the market is currently saturated\nwith new labels and genres of music. \"You have\nto dig really deep to find decent tracks in record\nshops now, which 1 must admit is the fun of it.\nBut I still think that there are way too many\nlabels around.\" So what led Colin to start off his\nown label? \"Nowadays DJs are expected to start\ntheir own labels. They are expected to make\nmusic. That's why I did it! But also the label is\n_ very much tied in with the radio show. I was\nhearing all these great tapes of unreleased\nmaterial from people and I thought that\nsomeone's got to get this stuff out.\"\nYou can check out past releases from\nColin's brother, Trevor Dale, the Advent and\na collective from South London called Devo.\nFuture releases will be from Ian O 'Brien,\nMark Bell (one half of LFO), Colin himself\nand Civil Attack.\nAs someone who has traveled the globe\nas a musical ambassador, Colin feels that\nthe \" London musical vibe\" is very important\nin an international sense. \" People abroad\nlooks to London as being the number one in\nterms of fashion, music and new ideas. We^] were the first to get into house music, we\nhad drum'n 'bass and punk before that; it\ngoes way back. London has had some very\nfresh ideas. People abroad still look towards\nus for inspiration, but then they'll do their\nown take on what London's doing. You can\nsee it now in that you can go to any big city\nin the world and find a d'n'b club. They take\nideas that are formed in London and just add\ntheir own flavour to it.\"\nThe criticisms that are often aimed at music\nmade on computers and DJing don't seem to\nbother Colin in what he does. \"The hardest thing\nto do is to give those machines some sort of\nsoul; to make that computer-generated music\nsound like it's got a tiny bit of human input and\nemotion in it. That's where the talent lies.\" As\nfor DJing being an overpaid hobby? \"I myself can\nfeel when a DJ is trying to do something more\nthan put two records together. I essentially think\na DJ is there to create some sort of atmosphere\nin a club. It can be dark, light, happy, sad or\nwhatever. Some can do it well, others can't. To\nme it is an art form. You can give two people the\nsame records and get them up there and one\nwill fail and the other will be perfect; even if they\nplay them in the same order. So it is very much\nan art.\"\nYou can hear the whole Colin Dale interview\nand a one hour mix if you listen to the Electric\nCafe this Sunday night from midnight - 2am on\nIC Radio.\nal;ck.\n\n"

We finished well\ndown the order with many excuses:\n'The track was appalling' (Matt\nDowie), 'They drove worse than the\nSpanish' (Simon Cope) and 'Grumble grumble grumble' (Phil\nWise, Peter Holroyd). One universal complaint was the 'heats' type\nof racing; each of the team's four\ndrivers competed in several heats\nand their finishing positions were\nthen combined in some complicated manner to produce team points.\nUnfortunately, this format was\nused again at Daytona Raceway in\nShepherds Bush. Here, our drivers\ndid better and managed third\nplace.\nWe were now looking forward\nto two rounds of racing at Milton\nKeynes. We may be mad, but not\nas mad as you might think. Here's why: The races were proper 1 Vz\nhour races and the track (Daytona\nInternational) is a huge one with\nplenty of dangerous flat-out cor-ner s. We thought we could do some winning here!\nThe day came&. started badly.\nWe waited for our star driver, Pete.\nWe waited some more. And some\nmore. Then we set off without him.\nEveryone was glum except me (it\nmeant 1 would get to drive instead\nof being sub and journalist). We then decided to go back down Exhibition Road, just in case, and\nthere he was, running from the tube\nstation (damn!).\nAt the track, the benefits of\nhaving Pete were beginning to\nshow: 4th in qualifying for the first\nrace.\nOnce they got underway, our\npace was confirmed and we drove\namong the leaders. We then made\na perfect refuelling stop and found\nourselves ahead. At our last driver\nchange, we looked all set to win\nuntil the driver (who shall remain\nnameless....) decided to leave the\npits at a red light. O oops. We were hauled in for a penalty stop &.\nended up finishing way down the\norder. This wrecked our chances\nfor the championship. Bollocks.\nDuring qualifying for the next\nrace, we brought Peter in to the\npits, but decided we shouldn't have\nand so sent him out again.\nUnfortunately not only did he not\nstop, but he didn't even slowdown. Following a short discussion\nwith the race director, we managed\nto do a 'double or quits' deal to\navoid the penalty for this (starting\nfrom the back of the grid). If we\nmessed up in the race, we would\nbe in serious trouble.\nWe won the race and began to\nwork out our championship pos i tion. We had the same number of\npoints as Cardiff, but because we\nhad done the most laps on the day,\nwe won. Nail-biting stuff. Hang on, we won! We won! WE WON!! Yippee! O nameless driver, you are\nforgiven because WE WON!( and\nbecause you bought us all a meal\nback in Ealing!)\nNiall Darwin\nSlappers Let Them In\nEITHER...\nIt was up at the crack of dawn for\nthe five illustrious paddlers selected\nfrom the Canoe Club to represent\nImperial at the BUSA Canoe Polo\nChampionships, held on a lake\nsomewhere near Stratford, last\nweekend.\nHicksy, Colin, Sam, 'Useless'\nRob and even Garth all surprisingly\nmade the 6 . 4 5 am meet time on Saturday morning, to be met by the\nproblem of one boxed in mini-bus.\nBut, with luck, and possibly a little\napplied break-in and entry, the\nteam had made it to the venue by\nthe 9 am start time.\nFirst up for the slaughter were\nCambridge B, who due to generally\npathetic shooting, we only managed to defeat by 2 goals to 1.\nBoth messy, testosterone induced\ngoals came from Garth.\nBristol, last year's runners up,\nlooked a more worthy opposition,\nespecially their shiny boats, which\nmades us feel embarrassed in our\ntech nicol our plastic outfits. The\nfirst half progressed dreadfully,\neven when given the ball at each\nrestart, we could find nothing better\nto do with it than pass it to the\nBristol boys to allow them to score\nagain. The second half saw a change (introduction?) of tactics,\nwith Hicksy chasing the ball and trying to connect with as many Bristol\nplayers as possible. Pressure\ncaused mistakes, and we even\nmanaged to connect the odd pass.\nA lovely little hand-off from Colin\ngave Sam a shot from near the half\nway line that hit the mark. Within\nanother minute he'd done it again -a comeback in the making?. The\nfinal result, 8-2 to Bristol was upset-ting, but we did dunk them more\nthan any other team in the\ntournament!!\nWe stayed on the water to await\nOxford. Something of a grudge\nmatch since a tournament in Bristol\nlast year, they proved themselves a more coherent team, going 2 goals\nup rapidly. A revival started, mostly due to a long pass to Hicksy\nunder the goal, and then another\nmore fluid play along the wing,\nagain finding Hicksy, drawing us\nlevel. Blind referees and fun tackles\nsoon ended in Hicksy rolling up with\na broken paddle, much to the UL U refs enjoyment, until he realised\nthat it was one of their paddles we'd borrowed!! Still, you expect a lot of\nshafting at these events! Play\nresumed, but the pause allowed\nthem to regroup, and come back\nwith two more goals. At least they\nbow to our superior drinking skills.\nFree BBQ and reason bly priced\nbeer along with paddlers from\naround 35 Uni's meant a loud night\nwith traditional boat races that did-n't involve kayaks and a few human\npyramids that Garth provided an\nappr opiate ly sized centre stone for.\nIn keeping with the Imperial spirit,\nhowever, most of the team ail\nretired to the tents before the bar\neven closed!!!\nSunday saw another defeat to\nTeeside, 2-0. This was the wrong result but no-one was in the mood to score, so we gave the match\naway, mostly through poor passing\nand non-existent team-play. But\npossibly also down to Useless Rob\ngiving the ball to a Teeside sad boy two metres from our goal line.\nDignity was salvaged in the final\nmatch against Glamorgan. With\neveryone managing a goal except\nUseless Rob, who even felt safe\nenough to leave his goal and play\nwith the team! Final Result 4-0 to\nImperial.\nThe weekend rounded off with\nthe bus breaking down just outside\nthe union, but Useless Rob actually\nproved quite helpful by mending it\nafter the RAC guy condemned us to\nHunt's Trucks.\nSerious canoe polo happens at\nUL U. Usually, they're a right bunch\nof mincing poofs, but they managed to stay in the bar longer than\nmost of us, and beat their arch-rivals Bristol. With their mens team\nnarrowly losing to Loughborough in\nthe final, and their women taking\nthe ladies bronze, they've done well\nthis time.\nInterested in the canoe club in\nany of it's facets? Drop us a mail on slap per s@ ic.ac.uk.\nHicksy and Garth\n...OR\nCanoeists with balls...\nCanoeists with fannies more like .\nUp at the crack of dawn for the five\nshirt lifting paddlers...\n...who only managed to beat\nGlamorgan (where canoe polo can\nonly be played after the ice has\nmelted) and Cambridge B team (for\nnovices and complete spooner s)... and who were drunk under\nthe table by a bunch of similar\nmincing poofs from UL U! What a weekend of lashing s of\nginger beer, fun and fro licks that\nmust have been!\nSee you all in the pool tonight...\nso don't worry you can all get your\nown back then!\nAli P.

    "content": "14 MUSIC 15 May 1998\nCLUB SCENE LABEL PROFILE Just Flexing In Marvel City\nMarvel City Records (MCR) is a new dance label coming out of South London that looks set for big things. MCR is made up of three people :\nDexter (a well established DJ on the underground scene), Pypee, A&R and promotion and Redz, who balances the books. These three guys are\nalso known as the Flex Kru with their first single Watch The Flex (reviewed issue 1108) doing big things on the underground scene. Also sharing the office with the boys are DEA, a more out and out underground Garage label that has had its first few releases over the last month\n(reviewed issue 1112) with some wicked new tunes on the way. D) Dexter also recently compiled and mixed Bullion's Sub Level UK compi la tion: you can catch him live and direct as part of the Hit-squad on Upfront 99.3 FM (London's leading pirate station) Saturdays 2-4 pm where,\nyou can hear future releases first, and on the underground party circuit (La Costa Nosta, The Aquarium etc.)\nWhy was Watch the Flex released on\nBullion records not MCR ?\nPypee: Because we're a start up label\nwe want to associate ourselves with the\nlikes of Sony, being part of an establishments see, it gives us some status. We know all these underground small distribution companies that we know we can\nget our stuff out on but we didn't know\nwhether we could get our stuff out\nthrough the majors. So we've got the\nback up of a major distribution company behind our independent label, so now when we release stuff on MCR people\nwill be saying. Hey there, the Flex Kru,\nthey had a tune out with Sony we'll check\ntheir new one out etc. Instead of \" Who are they\nthen?\"\nWhat's the philosophy behind the label\nand your music ?\nPypee: You know the kids round here in\nSouth London ain't got nothing to look forward\nto. Working at Tescos ain't gonna get very far\nyou know, so we're trying to help all those bed-room producers and show them how to\napproach distribution companies, labels, how to\nget copyrights, all that sort of shit that they\ndon't have a clue about. If you're not careful you\nget screwed - especially the younger ones. You\ncould make the best tune ever and not make a penny from it, as a few people I know found\nout: they started young at making tunes and got\nsigned up on a contract that paid them a few\ngrand, but that was it: the record company kept\nthe rights etc. Basically they got ripped off,\nwe're about trying to change that.\nWe want MCR to be a flagship label bring\ninnovative beats and vocals. Being an outlet for\nall the people round here in (South London)\nmaking quality tunes in their bedrooms. They sit\nin their room and make all this quality music but\nthey have no outlet for it; how are these people\ngoing to talk with the likes of Sony and all that,\nthey ain't. Redz: Some people make a record and sell\nsay 5,000 copies and think \"Right that sold\n5,000 copies, we'll make everything else sound\nsimilar. It worked once, it'll work again.\" We aren't like that, that's not what it's all about, it's got to be from the heart.\nPypee: Because there's three of us and we\nall produce together, our sound is always chang-ing. We all argue over what we want and this\nalso helps to get a higher standard of production because we'll only use something we are all\nhappy with. We have Reggae dub by influences\nbecause it's our culture, as well as the whole\nbreakbeat, hip-hop and Rn' B things as well.\nDexter, Pypee & Redz: A lot of people get\nthe studio production side of things all locked\ndown but they don't have all the business, the\nfinance, promotion side of things locked down. In general, people seem to have one or the\nother. What we're doing here is trying to bring\nthe two together, show people how to deal with\nthe business side of it all. We are trying to help\nas many people as possible because we know\nwhat they're going through people have written\nthem off and just try and sting them. We teach\npeople about not just selling their tunes off for a quick buck, but how to get a copyright done;\nhow to register their tracks; how to get a license, so that when your tunes get played on\nthe radio or what ever you get paid etc. etc. All\nthese big companies want to do is sting the little guys like us.\nPypee: And the artists on our label will\nalways come back, it's the boomerang effect, if\nthey get signed to the big labels they'll always\ncome back because we treated them right.\"\nRedz: We look out for people, especially the\nyounger ones that don't know what it's all\nabout. They go head first into it and get in shit,\ndrugs, whatever, we stop them dead in their\ntracks and stop them before they make those\nmistakes because we've seen it all before. We don't go round saying to people \"Don't do this,\ndon't do that, we know everything, don't do drugs\", whatever, but what we do say is mode r ation: do everything in moderation - especially\ndrugs - then if, or when, you want to stop, you\ncan because in this business there's a lot of\ndrugs and that around.\nPypee: Here's a little story for ya, we know\nthis guy, yeah, who wants to be an MC and he\ncomes into the office saying \"I want to be aMC\", so what I did was go to the dictionary and\npicked a word out and said \"What does that\nmean?\" he goes \"1 don't know.\" So I say, \"Look,\nevery time you come in here, I want you to pick\nup five words and write them down and what\nthey mean yeah and before you go to bed I want\nyou to do another five and so on.\" He's going,\n\" Na, you're taking the piss, man\" and all that,\n\" No\"I say, \"There's a million and one\nwannabe MCs out there. If you really want\nto make it, you got to be doing something\nabout it, something different, be in tell i gent.\" Then two days later, his mum phones us up thanking us and all this, you\nknow it's nice.\nIs it out of hand the way every tune\nthat is released gets a garage mix,\nhouse, Rn' B etc, etc?\nPypee: Where I come from we didn't know what was R'n' B or jungle rap .what-ever. If I liked it, I liked it. That was it.\nSpeaking with Pypee made me realise\nthat maybe 1 was being over critical with\nthe whole remix thing. As he rightly pointed out, with all these remixes of old hardcore\ntunes 90-93, a lot of people into the scene now\nhad never heard the originals - especially the\nyounger crowds - so in a way it's paying respect\nto the originals by getting them heard again by\nmore people.\nPypee also pointed out, when I was talking\nabout how the music seeming to go in one\ndirection eg speed garage, that it's not the people making the records that are all \"Let's make\na tune that sounds like that\", it's the distribution\ncompanies that only buy the one style because\nthat's what's selling. There could be some completely different styles out there but you never\nget to hear them until the distributors feel there\nis a market.\nPypee: We don't want our music to be\npigeonholed as this type of music or that type,\nit's just good dance music. When you hear a hip-hop or a salsa track on the radio they don't say if it was a speed salsa track or whatever,\nthey just tell you the name of it. Why can't they\ndo that with House' n' Garage music?\nThe thing that impressed me about these\nboys is the amount of work they have done in\nall aspects; from decorating the offices (you\nwouldn't believe the transformation and I 've\nseen the photos to prove it) to getting the\nbusiness side well and truly locked down.\nThey have certainly done their homework.\nPypee explained that when they decided to do\nthis, they were going to do it properly, no cutting corners and the Understanding Tax video\non the shelf bore testament to this. From\nwhat I have witnessed myself over the past\nfew weeks, these guys are genuinely trying to\nhelp the people in and around their community, not just looking out for themselves. So if\nyou're a bedroom producer wondering what\nstep to take next, contact one of the boys on\n0181 771 7911, and look out for the future\nrelease on MCR and DEA and the whole\nUpfront 99.3 FM crew.\nfo Public\n\n"

I would like to\npoint out that there have been two\npresidents of C&GC U this year,\nViveke Bhalla and Hamish Common. Althought the above\ncomment probably does apply to\nViveke, Hamish has really started\nto improve the operation of\nC&GC U since he took over. This is\nnot just my sentiment, Andy He eps commented to the same effect at\nthe last ICU Council meeting.\nNext year sees the cent e nery of\nCity fx Guilds College Union. It is\nimportant that C&GC U is restored\nto its former glory for next year, and\nit is important that the members of\nC&GC U( all the students in the\nManagement, Computing and engineering departments!) help Hamish\nand the Exec, to achieve this.\nThe Annual General Meeting of\nC&GC U will be held on Tuesday\n19th May at 6 pm in the Union\nDining Hall.

I copy it to Felix for the benefit of the wider membership.\nA question was asked at the\nmeeting about the Union's decision\nnot to take direct control of the\nbars on August I1998. Such a decision has not been made; a meeting of the Union Trading\nCommittee deferred the decision\nuntil such time as the sabbatical\nteam could investigate whether a more viable option (and by more\nviable, I mean more beneficial to\nthe membership who will use those\nbars) could be found. Together\nwith Katie Armstrong, Nick Carter\nand the Deputy Secretary of the\nSchool of Medicine, Iam investigating whether an external comp any could achieve the aims of flexibility and low prices demanded by\nsuch outlets. One company has\nshown an interest in tendering such\na bid.\nHowever, the decision has not\nyet been taken by the Union, and\nwe still have first refusal on any\nproposals.

Consisting of several options, the most drastic\nsuggested a blanket ban on smoking in all residences. These\nplans come soon after recent\nHealth and Safety Committee action banning smoking in the JCR\n[Felix 1109].\nCurrently smoking is prohibited\nin the halls' social areas but under\nthe wardens' proposal smokers\nwould no longer be permitted to\nseek refuge in their rooms. The\nmeasures are a manifestation of\nthe college's recognition of the\ndangers posed by smoking. The\nmeeting raised a number of issues,\nwith significant support for the ban\ncoming from Dr Margaret Good game, college tutor. She highlighted the plight of asthma sufferers who now make up one in ten of\nthe population. Cigarette smoke\noften aggravates the condition and\nshe emphasised it was important\nto take into account the comfort of\nall residents. Other factors supporting the ban, such as reduced\ninsurance fees, form part of an\nongoing investigation into the war-dens' proposals. A current court\ncase involving an employee suing\nher employers for damages after\nher health was ruined by the\nsmoke-filled environment in which\nshe was forced to work, could also\nbe a consideration.\nThe committee chose to maintain the current policy, reflecting\nthe convincing arguments against\nfurther smoking restrictions; residents are fee-paying adults, many\nof whom are likely to object. There\nis also the potentially nightmarish\ntask of suitably disciplining those\nwho breach any new regulations.\nThe committee decided to make\nthe newly refurbished Southwell\nHall non-smoking next year to add\nto the already smoking-free Weeks\nHall as a trial run.\nAll plans are currently at a developmental stage and Dr\nRichard Murphy, Chair of the SubWardens committee, felt the matter should be resolved by \"a college\nwide consensus\". He was determined to allay the fears of smokers,\nexplaining the proposals were \"not\nintended to be a Draconian mea-sure\" and any permanent regulations would be the result of extensive consultation.\nIndonesia in Turmoil: Students Shot\nED SEXTON\nThis week Indonesia has witnessed unrest and rioting that\nhas left six students dead and\nseveral hundred injured.\nThe shootings occurred during\na protest on Tuesday at Trisakti\nUniversity, a private college of\n2 9 , 0 0 0 elite students in Jukarta.\nAn estimated 5,000 students left\ntheir campus around noon, aiming\nto march to the Mayor's office with\na petition demanding the resignation of President Suharto. The\ndemonstration was peaceful, but\nwas blocked by police on the airport road to Jakarta outside the\nuniversity campus. Reinforcements\nquickly arrived, including Britishm a de armoured Tactica cars with\nwater cannons, but the atmosphere\nwas initially good humour ed. After\na brief shower of rain the crowd began to thin out, and the protesters started to retreat in the late\nafternoon. According to various\nreports a scuffle then broke out\nbetween a plain-clothed policeman\nand some students, which led to\npolice charging the retreating\nDictator Suharto: Not a nice man.\ncrowd with clubs. Tear gas, rubber\nand live bullets were used, leaving\nmany students bleeding on the\nstreet. The police chased the students back on to the campus, where the worst injuries occurred,\nas snipers fired into the campus\nfrom a nearby overpass. All major\nentrances to the university were\nblocked by police with troop lor-ries. The six dead and over sixty\ninjured were taken to Sumber\nWaras Hospital, but as night fell\nmany students were still una c counted for. Jakarta's police chief,\nMajor General Haman i Nata,\nclaimed that the police had only\nbeen issued with blank and rubber\nrounds, and has launched an investigation. The violence, however, has\ncontinued. During the memorial\nservice at the university on Wednesday, a riot broke out which\nresulted in thousands battling with\npolice and reportedly left one protester dead.

The new single\nRuffneck is due for release on the\n22nd June and it's gonna be another smash, so look out for a full\nreview nearer the time. After the\nhuge success of their last release\nand their blistering live sets, they\nhave been receiving worldwide acclaim. On a recent trip to the\nUSA, they teamed up with Arthur\nBaker to record a track for their\nforth coming album featuring the\nvocal talents of Soul Sonic Force.\nThey have also had meetings\nwith rapper Chuck D( Public\nEnemy), and it seems as if a collaboration is underway for the album.\nWith the boys not only meeting, but\nalso working with one of their idols,\nI can't wait to hear the end prod-uc t. Don't forget, the boys are playing live all over the place: DJ sets in\nthe not too distant future are:\nPhoenix and Reading, GalleryTurnmills, 2 2 nd May, Heavenly\nSocial - Tummills, 30th May. Tuff and |am are set to release\ntheir first full production since the\ntop 40 smash TJR- Just Gets Better,\nSweet Love featuring Bennet &\nMa cardo. I'm told it occupies the\nsame tuff groove territory and I can't wait to hear it. It should be\navailable on promo in the coming weeks and full release in the not\ntoo distant future.\nTuffjam's mixed compilation album, Underground Frequencies\nvol.2, will also be released some\ntime this month, featuring not only\nup-front flavours but some classics\nfrom the past such as Love Shy and\nM Dubs vol.1.\nWhilst on the garage tip, it's been\ngood to see that the scene's continually evolving not stagnating, as\nso many critics suggested it might.\nI 've heard comments such as\n\"every tunes got a wah wah sub\nbass and people are bored with it,\nall those people that jumped on the\nband wagon when all the speed\nstuff was going on have jumped off\nagain.\" The sound has totally\nchanged again over the last few\nmonths, moving away from the\nwah wah sub bass and more into\nclever key and beat arrangements.\nI 've been calling it The Smooth\nGroove Sound, to give it a label.\nCritics still don't seem to\nunderstand that the people making\nthe music get bored quicker than\nthe people listening because they\nwant to make something different\nand original. They also have a deep\nand genuine love for the music,\nsomething the mainstream music\npeople are not used to. This is why\nmusic will keep growing and chang-ing.\nLast up: Scott Garcia's club\nnight. It's A London Thing, currently at No4 Kingston, is on the move\nin a few weeks. It's still going to be\non every week in London Town, I 'll\nlet you know as soon as the new\nvenue has been decided upon. On top of this, they are going to be\ndoing a UK and European tour, so\nlook out for them popping up all\nover the place.\njo Public\nCLUB SCENE SINGLES DRUM * BASS / DOWNBEAT GABAGE\nUndercover Agent: Cosmic / Full\nMetal /acker (|u ice)18 th May.\nThis is another fresh biscuit from\nthe Juice boys. From spacey effects\nand atmospheric als and a minimal\ndrum pattern, this builds into a right storm er with futuristic bass\ntones and tight chopped up drums.\nThis is getting dropped by all the\nbig boys such as Hype, Zinc and\nBryan Gee.

The more I hear this\ntrack, the more I like it.\nStep 2: Fluid / Hardnoise Out Now\nAnother true double A sided piece\nof vinyl, with both sides doing the\nbusiness. Fluid has a dark intro,\nquickly dispensed with, as a raw\ntearing drum pattern takes over.\nAmen stabs come in and out of the\nmix, keeping it bubbling along. It is\nas hard as you like. With a subtle\nbassline, the clever beat arran gm ents and synthesised sounds do all the damage. The flip-side is just\nwhat it says: rugged beats that roll\nalong, a strong bassline and clever\natmosphere ical s and effects.\nMagistrate: Phohibited\n(East side) Out Now\nWords like smooth and phat come to mind when listening to this\ntrack, with its rumbling sub-bass,\ntight beats and killer flexed bass\nline. . The flipside is darker and in a2 step style e.I love the eerie\neffects alongside the beats. Then in\ndrops the wobbly bassline and\nstepping drums.\nMuk i: Fullscope (Manta) 18th May\nThis is downbeat at it's very best:\nchilled, trip py and beautiful all at\nthe same time. You get four tracks\non here: all can be loosely\ndescribed as above. All feature\nclever programming aside dreamy\nvocals and inspired atom sphere ical s. Sheer class. Get away from it\nall without leaving the comfort of\nyour stereo. Muk i brings in a breath\nof fresh air.\n]o Public\nNu-Birth: Anytime (XL) 25th May\nAnytime was a big hit when released last year, now it's back\nwith as hit load of new mixes. So\nmany in fact that there should be\nsomething for all tastes. Tuff Jam\ndo an inspired reworking of this\ntrack, bringing it bang up to date\nwith more of the vocal than the\noriginal, but in a way that works so\nwell With the upbeat broken by\ntwo-step beats and stabs of sax\nand keys, it is wicked. The Dem2 mix is a slow two-step style and\nthey even give it a dark edge. The\nCrazy Bank mix hardens it up by\nadding time stretches and other\nthings. I suppose some would call\nthis the speed mix. The original is\nalso on here in case you missed it\nfirst time around.\nLovestation: Teardrops (Fresh\nRecords) 25 May\nAnother double 12\" pack, with\neight mixes to choose from including R'n' B, Classic House and more\ndub by workings. These are all\nmixes of the chart hit of the 80s from Womack and Womack. I'm positive that this will go down well\nat the more commercial clubs. That\nsaid, there are a couple of mixes\nthat I have been playing. The\nBanana Republic dub is quite\nsuperb: it almost gets away with\nusing the Footsteps sample without you noticing whet e it's taken\nfrom and the added deep inside\nvocal, easy going beats and nice\nkey patterns means it's been going\ndown well in the clubs. If you want\nto go a little harder. Wildcat also do a quality mix with heavy jungle\novertones. Have you got a license\nto play this sort of dub plate is\ntaken from Chrome' n' Time jungle\ntrack alongside time stretched title\nvocals. It just gets better as it goes\non.\nY Tribe: Baby (You Bring Me Up)\n(Deconstruction) 25th May.\nOne for the vocal garage lover. 1\nlike the beats and arrangements of\nthe original mix but the vocal does\nnothing for me. The dub mix just\nisn't hard enough either but should\nwork well in the more commercial\nclubs. I'm not so sure about the\nunderground appeal though.\nIP\n\n"

    "content": "ARTS\nARTY THINGS FOR YOUR DELECTION\nA QUESTION OF MERCY\nThe Bush Theatre\n15 May 1998\nA Question of Mercy is the\nchallenging new work by\nAmerican playwright David\nRabe, in which he confronts head\non the sensitive issue of doctor\nassisted suicide. We, the audience,\nare thrust abruptly into the life of\nAnthony, a young man whose existence has been transformed by\nAIDS into one of endless illness and\nsuffering, and who has reached the\npoint where he wishes, quite simply in his eyes, to die. It is our privilege and pain, in equal measures,\nto observe the tortuous process by\nwhich Anthony and his lover\nThomas attempt to fulfil this wish,\nfrom the moment at which Dr.\nRobert Chapman, an ex-surgeon\nwhose initial opposition to\neuthanasia could hardly be\nstronger, is drawn into their plans.\nThe play is based on an essay\nby Richard Selzer, which in drawn\ndraws predominantly on fact. The\nmomentum of the piece is provided by the changing attitudes of the\ncharacters to their task, as its\nnature becomes increasingly clear.\nAnthony and Thomas begin with a romantic notion of suicide; all their\nideas are of soft lights and sweet\nmusic, of \"being together at the\nend.\" Dr. Chapman, becoming gradually, unconsciously involved,\nmakes clear the need for meticulous planning and grim de termina tion. Anthony now begins to take\nthis to obsessive levels, while\nChapman and Thomas become preoccupied with the basic illegality of what they are to attempt:\nAnthony will, at the appointed time, take a lethal dose of barb it u rates, but if this method fails,\nChapman will duly administer a morphine injection. This preoccupation is the result more of a need\nfor something to fall back in, in a time when the framework of one's personal convictions has collapsed,\nthan of the belief that the legal\nsolution to this problem is the\n\"right\" one.\nAs the critical day approaches,\nthe realisation dawns on all except\nAnthony himself that in all of this\npainstaking and harrowing attention to detail, they have neglected\nto consider themselves: how their\nemotions will influence their\nactions and those of Anthony. As the play draws to its close, the\nalready labyrinthine plot twists still\nfurther, reaching a conclusion which in no way serves as a resolution of the conflicts raging through-out.\nThe story is told through direct,\ndialogue based scenes, interspersed with soliloquies, mainly by\nChapman as a semi-narrator, and\nthe highly effective but, until one\ngrasps the unreality of the situ a tion, terrifying nightmare sequence.\nWe are spared no details, and for\nme the concentration of repetitive\nsoul-searching and introspection is\na little too high. The production\nrests on solid, powerful performances, the cast even succeeding\nin play down the excessive use of\nmonologues, and the staging of the\npiece is entirely suitable, minimal,\nbut without clear definitions of\nspace.\nBoth the writing and Doug Hughes' direction have a marked\neffect on the emotional reactions\nof the observer: I reach almost the\npeak (or depth) of a particular\nemotion, when something in the\ntension on stage shifts, and 1 am plunged into a different feeling\nentirely. This means that the play\ndoes not produce an overriding\nsentimental response, rather evoking in the audience a sharp sense of\nthe inner and outer conflicts\ninvolved. From the audience it\ndemands intense concentration\nand sustained mental effort, and is\nnot a play to be simply \"enjoyed.\"\nThe play claims no solutions to the\nproblem it portrays, and emphasises not the question of \"right or\nwrong,\" but of what, given human\nnature and emotions, is truly p ossi ble, and, for a few hours afterward\nat least, seems to place the edifice\nof our society on somewhat shaky\nfoundations.\nAM Kirk\n\"A Question of Mercy\" written by\nDavid Rabe, directed by Doug\nHughes,\nBush Theatre, Shepherd's Bush\nGreen, W12, Mon-Sat 8pm until\nMay 23rd. \u00a310, \u00a37 cones, nearest tube\nShepherd's Bush/Goldhawk Road.\nAS THOUSANDS CHEER\nBarbican Centre\nOriginally released in 1933,\nthis musical revue has\nbeen revived from the\nIrving Berlin family archives by the\ndirector Ian Marshall Fisher. At the\noutset it created controversy with a song entitled \" Heatwave\" which\ncontained the lyric \"She started a heatwave, by letting her seat\nwave.\" The fact that it singled out\nsome of the most influential people\nof the time, in a series of satirical\nsketches, seemed to pass the\nAmerican public by.\nIn two acts, the cast of eight\nexplore the big stories that hit the\npress that year. The set is very min-i mal:a stage, eight chairs and a pianist, and the only props are the\nscripts which each actor reads from\nthroughout the performance. The\nfact that this is, in a sense, a read\nrehearsal does not detract from its\natmosphere and impact. The\nunusual aspect of this musical is\nthat the cast can act as well as sing,\nand the simplicity helps you to concentrate on expression and\ncharacter.\nDon't worry if your 1930's general knowledge is a bit patchy,\nbecause everything is explained at\nthe beginning of the performance\nby the director and a celebrity\nguest, who in my case was Dick\nVosburgh.\nThe play covers a range of\ndiverse topics from the heatwave\nthat hit America at that time to the\nInternational Debts conference,\nand the structure of a newspaper is\nretained as they work through\nhome and International affairs to\nthe \"funny s\". The great thing about the musical is that it observes the fanatical\nefforts of its subjects with wry\ninsight. Waiters and chambermaids striving to become literary\ngreats after a visit from English\nplaywright Noel Coward; the erection of a enormous theatre on 6th avenue as a birthday gift for Mr Rockefeller senior who's motto runs: \" Hang on to your money\". My favourite sketch was inspired by\nthe expanding popularity of radio\nstations. An opera show is brought\nto the audience courtesy of the\nnew generation of millionaires from\nwhich the company has had to\nseek sponsorship. Unfortunately,\nthis happens to be the makers of a fantastic new mustard sauce for\nsteak, you'll wonder how you ever\nmanaged to live without it folks.\nThis musical was the first in a series that are being shown at the\nBarbican Centre entitled \"The Lost\nMusicals\". Forthcoming productions from the same director\ninclude \" On a Clear Day You Can\nSee Forever\", \" Hollywood Pinafore\" and \"The Frogs\".\nDemelza\nAS THOUSANDS CHEER at the\nBarbican Centre\n(Music/lyrics Irving Berlin, book\nMoss Hart)\nLast night: This Sunday - Go!\n\n"

    "content": "18\nREVIEWS FILM 5 May 1998\nDEEP IMPACT\nStarring: Robert Duvall, Elijah Wood, Morgan Freeman\nDirector: Mimi Leder * * * V2\nThank God \u2022 the Americans are here to rescue us once again\nIt may sound like a porn film but\nDeep Impact is actually the first\nof a pair of Me fe or style su mmer blockbusters. Scientists have\ndiscovered that there is a comet on\na collision course with Earth which\nis so massive that its impact will\ncause an \"ELE\", an Extinction Level\nEvent. In other words, humanity is\ngoing to disappear unless America,\nled by President Morgan Freeman,\ncan do something about it.\nFortunately, the film is not as\nmindless as the synopsis would\nhave us believe. Sure, there's plenty of action as Robert Duvall flies a squad of nuclear missile-wielding\nastronauts toward the comet's surface in an attempt to blow it off\ncourse, but just as much screen\ntime is devoted to how various individuals react to their impending\ndeaths.\nIn the event of Duvall failing, the\nUS government has randomly\nselected one million people to live\nin a secure underground \"Ark\" for\ntwo years, after which they will be\nthe foundation of a new civilisation.\nNaturally, the other five billion people on the planet are a bit disappointed at not being chosen and\nDeep Impact frequently focuses on\ntheir reaction.\nSurprisingly it is these ancillary\nscenes that reduce the impact of\nthe film. The director has clearly\nattempted to develop characters\nfar more than in the usual disaster\nmovie but has failed due to the\ncasting. The ubiquitous romance in\nthe form of two lovesick pre-pubescent teenagers is unlikely to\nappeal to any of the audience while\nmost other characters are far too\nstereotypical. It is only the little-used Freeman who performs with\nany panache, and as a result one\njust sits back and waits for the\ninevitable special effects to begin.\nWhen they do arrive, and the\nbudget kicks in, they alone justify\nthe price of the ticket - the sight of\na three kilometre high tidal wave\ntravelling at faster than the speed of\nsound will have you at the edge of\nyour seat. Consequently, whist aiming at something deeper are more\nmeaningful than your average big\nbudget rollercoaster, once again its\nonly the effects that are notable.\nThus, its unlikely to better the year's other inbound comet caper -Armageddon - which is (very deliberately) just as mindless as its\nsounds.\nDespite Deep Impact's good intentions, it will probably only be\nremembered for having the most\noutrageous special effects in\nhistory. At least until Godzilla. O Chris\nSLIDING DOORS\nStarring: Gwyneth Paltrow, John Hannah, John Lynch\nDirector: Peter Howitt * * * *\nExams getting you down? Wall-to-wall revision proving\nall too much? Relax take a break, and take in one of the most\ninnovative romantic comedies released for a long time.\nGwyneth Paltrow, sporting a surprisingly convincing London accent, leads as a sacked advertising exec who returns home to find\nher boyfriend in bed with another\nwoman. Or she doesn't. You see,\nthe neat trick about which the film\nrevolves is that her entire life\ndepends on whether or not she\ncatches the tube, or is just too late\nto beat the titular \"Sliding Doors\".\nIn Reality One, she returns\nhome early, meets charming, witty\nJohn Hannah (the gay, Scottish guy\nin Four Weddings) on the tube and\ncatches her boyfriend, John Lynch,\nat it with his ex. On Hannah's advice she starts a new life, sets-up\nher own company and surprise surprise falls in love. In reality two, she\nmisses the tube, returns home later\nin the day, sticks with Lynch and\nends up taking waitress ing jobs.\nOK, so it's soppy, slushy and\noccasionally sickeningly romantic,\nbut then what were you expecting?\nThe important point is that this isn't film making by numbers. There's no\nsign of the standard plotting ahd\ncharacter is ation which usually\naccompanies the words \"starring\nMeg Ryan\". The characters are\nfleshed out, and if at the end of the\nday the likelihood of bumping into\nyour ideal partner on a tube might\nseem utterly unbelievable, the plot\nis still involved enough to grip your\nattention through to the final\nminute.\nSadly, however, a promising\nconcept proves difficult to film.\nAlthough director How it t uses\nsome nice touches to cut between\nthe two storylines, the ending in\nparticular is unsatisfactory and\nrushed. Indeed, you could be forgiven for leaving the cinema feeling\nthat what started out so promisingly has simply been thrown away.\nThe acting too leaps from spot\non, particularly from Hannah - who is a natural romantic lead - to\nappallingly stereotypical, with the\nmain culprit Jeanne Tripplehorn as\n\"the other woman\". Fortunately,\nthe film focuses on Paltrow and\nHannah, who manage to achieve a rarely seen level of chemistry and\nbe liev ab lil ty. This allows Paltrow to\nshow that she really does have the\ntalent (and the requisite endearing\nsmile) to carve out a future as a romantic lead.\nFunny, romantic and heart-warming, Sliding Doors is a noble\nattempt to make something traditional yet original. A nineties take\non romantic comedy a la sixties\nCary Grant, it is ultimately flawed.\nYet the imaginative touches shown\nby both director and cast mark it\nout as head and shoulders above\nthe competition.

However, in the months\nleading up to the referendum, the main con tenders have already made themselves known.\nJeffery Archer (now Lord Archer of WesternSuper-Mare) and Ken Livingstone have already\nthrown their hats into the ring, although both\nwill have to fight hard to win the backing of their\nparties.\nThe Tories have promised a 'one member\none vote' selection process, with William Hague\nrefusing to endorse any of the likely candidates.\nThis could well benefit Mr Archer, who has been\nspending millions courting his party's grass-Ken Livingstone, some time ago (left), and\nJeffery Archer (right). Photo: Diana Harrison\nroots. Mr Livingstone, however, faces a more\nup-hill struggle. Although the former leader of\nthe Greater London Council is undeniably popular with both the Labour membership and the\nelectorate, his party's high-command is likely to\nrule him out as a contender. They fear his socialist policies could undo their ' New Labour' image\nshift, with Mr Livingstone already committing\nhimself to swing eing taxes on fat cat directors,\nincluding what he described as a \"Cedric Brown\ngreedy bastard rate\". Instead, a more 'Blairite'\ncandidate is anticipated, with Chris Smith\n(Culture Secretary) and Frank Dobson (Health\nSecretary) the current favourites.\nImportantly, both ' Red' Ken and 'Gobshite'\nArcher have refused to stand if they do not\nreceive their respective parties endorsements.\nConsequently, the search is on for an independent candidate, from outside the Commons mainstream, who will bring both fresh-air and\nbusiness acumen to the role. Richard Branson\nhas been touted by many, and frequently tops\nopinion polls, thanks to his combination of continuing business success and man-of-the people\nimage. However, he is refusing to commit him-self, as he says he cannot divert himself from his\ninterests at present.\nIn all likelihood, we will therefore see two\nvery similar candidates standing, with very similar manifesto commitments, only separated by\nthe colour of their rosettes.\nHAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS HAIR NEWS\ni HAIRCUT\n\u00a38.00\nUNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX UNISEX\nINCLUDES! cV CONSULTATION with stylist to discuss your style, try\na new look and learn how to manage and control your hair.\n<3c SHAMPOO followed by Herbal Conditioner and scalp\nmassage.\n.V PRECISION HAIRCUT by fully qualified hair stylist,\nexperienced in modern hairdressing.\n<VU5E OF HAIR DRIER with complementary gel or\nmousse to finish your style.\nOPEN 9.OOAM - 6.00PM Last Appointment for Hair Cut 6 . 0 0 pm Rhone for information on other special offers, e.g. Perms.

So should we believe the\nhype? Massive Attack have always\nbeen known as pioneers and quite\nrightly so, Blue Lines fresh after all\nthese years. Does Mezzanine push\nback musical frontiers (should we\nexpect it to?) or has the reputation\nof their former two albums coaxed\npeople into giving it a listen as happened to myself.\nThis is initially the first mistake\nyou can make. If you are expecting\nsomething similar to Protection or\nBlue Lines you will be disappoint-ed. What strikes you first is how dark and shadowy Mezzanine is. It\nis a difficult listen and its harrowing\noppressive-ness engulfs you especially towards the second half as\nyou deliberate your way through it.\nThere is a clear distinction\nbetween the first and second half\nof the album. Angel begins the\nrecord, staggering epic like on morbid legs, awash with a throbbing\nbass line and crunching guitars\nturned up to full distortion. You are\ngiven some light relief when Rising\nSon rolls along with its familiar resonance along with its nicked lyrics,\n'Where have all the flowers gone,\nlong time passing'. Next you are\nwhisked through Teardrop and Inertia Creeps on to Exchange\nwhere the mood is brightened considerably with a more chilled out\nlaid back-ness and a definite\nabsence of grinding guitars. Here\nthe first half ends and you enter the\nheavier more trying second half.\nDissolved Cirl rises to a distorted\nguitar climax that would sound\nmore at home on a Megadeath\nrecord, though this brief interlude\nreturns to the haunting vocals of Liz\nFraser with a familiar trip hop back-ing. Man Next Door and Croup\nFour are the more accessible of the\nsecond half.\nIt was a surprise to discover the\nmeaning of mezzanine on a program of Wipeout the other day but\nthe biggest surprise was the disappointment of this album after having been impressed by their previous efforts. El\nJason\nGOMEZ\nBring It On \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 >/2\nTHE DANDY WARHOLS\nThe Dandy Warhols Come Down * * \u2022 y2 After their huge impact on the\nstudent radio chart with 78\nStone Wobble, Gomez have\nreleased this their debut album,\nwhich carries on from where their\nsingle left off. Unusually the band\nhas two lead singers; one a Commitments styled voice, perfect\nfor the blues with its gravelly texture and the other in contrast very\nsoft in sound and these are used in\ntandem to perfection. They go through the songs interchanging\nthe singers to suit the mood of the\nsongs, which all hint at different\ntypes of guitar ing, ranging from\nCountry to Mexican. Their lyrics give a lot of the\nenergy to album, about going down to the Union, hanging out in\nPiccadilly or just plain trying to get\narrested which sum up life at the\nmoment for the average student.\nYou feel that their style is always\nallowed to flow throughout and\nthat it was just written and recorded because they enjoy it.\nGet Myself Arrested, possibly\nthe best song on the album, encapsulates the essence of the band.\nThe great harmonies achieved, where you're not sure who is the\nlead singer, as both voices are so\nassured, combine with the bounce\nof the rhythm and care- free-ness\nof the song. I would have thought\nthat this will be their next single.\nThe band quite often slow the\nsongs down, becoming near\nacoustic for a large portion of the\nalbum, allowing the singers to\nshow you just how good they are\nand what power they're capable of.\nFree To Run the best of these\ntracks shows the blues side of the\nband and you have to admit that\ntheir diversity is admirable.\nFor a debut album, it's everything that you want and shows\noriginality and innovation that is\nnow so rarely found. The easiest\nway to general is e is that it is a student album through and through,\nand definitely doesn't take itself\ntoo seriously. The singers are great,\nthe lyrics perfect and everything\nelse just falls into place around\nthem It's at a special low price for\na limited period, make use of it.CI\nDisco Stu\nH ave you heard of the Dandy\nWarhols? If you have, then\nit's probably because of\ntheir current single, Not If You Were\nThe Last Junkie On Earth - a nice\nblend of surf/pop/rock/psychedelia\nthat sounds a bit like Weezer.( Well, it does to me anyway.) If you\nhaven't, then it's a shame because\nthis album is a lesson to all the\nretro-meisters out there that like to\ntake the sixties and bring it, kicking\nand screaming, into the nineties.\nMainly the work of frontman\nand singer Courtney Taylor, this\nbunch of Americans have been\naround for a while, its just that noone over here really took any\nnotice. ...Come Down is their second album to date. Their debut,\nDandys Rule OK came along in the\nmidst of the grunge scene and was\na misunderstood set of songs.\nWho wanted to listen to retro when\nNirvana were expo u ning the latest\nin heavy guitars and screaming\nvocals? Their latest comes at a time when people are getting back\nto the whole sixties thing. A few\nyears after the death of grunge, the\nDandys actually make sense.\nIf you have just heard the sin-g les, then you've been mislead.\nSure, Every Day Could Be A Holiday\nis a brilliantly psychedelic number,\nbut this is NOT, repeat NOT indicative of the album. Imagine Weezer\nbeing merged with a little\nSpiritualised and you're closer to\nthe essence of the songs. Most of\nthe tracks have an almost drone-like quality to them overlay ed by\nvery dreamy harmonies.\nWhere it does fail is in the fact\nthat Courtney Taylor has indulged\nhimself a little too much.

Taboule is a couscous-based salad originally from the Mediterranean basin. Couscous is a wheat based cereal product in the form of tiny\nlittle balls. It is easily available and has even\nbeen over-processed by culinary scientists from\nthe greatest mega lo petro-chem ico alimentary\nmultinationals into a boil-in-the-bag form. Luckily this sort of thing won't be necessary\nhere.\nThe second item in this week's double bill is\ngrilled aubergine.

This removes any\nloose flour and bits and pieces so the grain stay\nwell separated and starts the wetting the couscous. Drain lightly and put the moistened couscous in a large bowl or pan.\nChop the tomatoes and cucumber into\nsmall cubes and slice the spring onions. Add these to the couscous along with the juice of\nthe lemon, 4 or 5 tablespoons of olive oil, a large pinch of salt and some ground pepper.\nFinely chop the mint and parsley and stir\nthem thoroughly into the salad.\nNow for the really cunning bit. Place the\nsalad in a plastic bag and put into the fridge\novernight. The salt will make the tomatoes and\ncucumber bleed their juices, which will be\nabsorbed by the grain until they have swelled\ncompletely and turned gorgeously moist and\nsucculent.\nFinally garnish with some more mint and a few olives and enjoy.\nAubergine Crisps\nTake one large aubergine and cut it into\nslices about '/j cm thick.
