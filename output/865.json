    "content": "Roland Flowerdew reports on the air shows around London this year.\n1990:50th Anniversary of\nBritain probably has the highest number of air shows per head of any country in the world, and London is\na good centre to get to many of them. Listed in this\nfeature are some of the major displays in the South\nof England; dates for other displays can be found in\nmagazines such as Air Display International. There are\nmany RAF open days around the country, and there\nare few parts of the country that are not within\nstriking distance of one of these. Even if your interest\nin aircraft is minimal, it can be well worth attending\none of these events, because most are geared to cater\nfor 'all the family', with plenty of other attractions..\nAirshows tend to fall into two categories, military\nand civilian. Military air shows are staged by air forces,\nbut in many cases there are private aircraft on display.\nThe reverse also applies; at many civilian air shows there is a military presence, for example, the Red\nArrows. As might be expected, civilian air shows tend\nto have more historic aircraft, both types have\nadvantages and disadvantages. Given below are\ndetails of three different types of airshow: civilian,\nmilitary and trade.\nMost people consider the aerobatic display teams\nto be the highlight of any airshow. Military air display\nteams usually fly advanced jet trainers, because frontline fighters are extremely expensive to run, while\ncivilian aerobatic display teams fly aircraft such as the\nPitts Special, a piston-engined biplane. The difference\nis one of speed and scale; the BAe Hawk that the Red\nArrows fly is capable of up to 1000 km/hr at sea level,\nbut a Pitts Special can loop in not much more than\nits own length. Jet aircraft are visually more\nimpressive however: at any airshow, when the Red\nArrows are announced, the beer tents clear, the\nhangers empty and everyone looks around and into\nthe distance for the nine headlights that portend their\narrival. Flying over 100 displays per season, the Red\nArrows are Britain's premier aerobatic team (and\nmany would argue that they are the world's best).\nThey were formed in 1965, originally flying Gnats, and\nquickly established a reputation for formation flying\nof absolute precision. The skill involved in performing,\nfor example, a formation roll is phenomenal, because\nnot only do the outer craft have to roll, they have to\n'corkscrew' around the axis of the roll to maintain the\nimpression of the rolling formation. The Red Arrows\nconverted to Hawks for the 1980 season, after Gnats\nwere withdrawn from general RAF use. The Hawk\noffered an improved performance envelope, with a better fuel consumption, and better service ability, and\nthis meant improved displays. The Red Arrows usage\nof the Hawk has led to a large number of sales of the\ntype to other air arms, and good publicity for the UK\naerospace and defence industries.\n\u2022 Arrive very early to beat the queues, and aim to be\nat your selected vantage point at least an hour before\nthe flying display begins.\n\u2022 Use some form of sun-burn protection. Even on a dull day you can end up with a very red face.\n\u2022 Never leave litter around-it can cause lethal\naccidents.\n\u2022 Take something else to do in case there is a lull in\nactivity.\nNorth Weald: Fighter Meet 1990\nThis airshow has the distinction of being the only one\nwith an underground station (North Weald, Central\nLine) a short walk away, and this is probably the best\nway of getting there. When buying your ticket, you\nmay have to contend with London Transport staff\nwho do not believe the station exists! If you buy a travelcard you may have to queue to pay a supplement at North Weald station as it is outside\ntravelcard zone 5. LT usually provide admission\ninclusive fares. The airshow itself is a mixture, with\nsome representation from the RAF and other air\nforces, but much of the display consists of older\naircraft. A favourite theme consists of mock dog-fights, complete with explosive effects, which are\nusually very good.\nMildenhall: Air Fete '90\nThe largest (and best) airshow in Britain, Mildenhall\nregularly attracts over 300,000 visitors over the\nweekend, approximately equivalent to 14% of the\npopulation of the UK. Run by the USAF, Mildenhall\nhas a large number and variety of military aircraft from\nmost NATO members, and usually boasts over six\nhours of flying display per day. In the past, the\nLockheed SR-71A( Blackbird) has flown here, and\nother types include Rockwell B1B, Boeing AWACS,\nLockheed Galaxy (larger than a Boeing 747).\nMildenhall often manages to get foreign aerobatic\ndisplay teams such as the Patrouille de France, as well\nas the Red Arrows. If you do think of going to this\nairshow, it is possible to go by rail, but it would\nprobably be much cheaper to go by car with friends,\nsince there is a flat car parking/entry charge regardless\nof the number of occupants. It is best to aim to arrive\nbefore 9am, because huge traffic jams form, and you\ncan spend three hours stuck outside.\nFarnborough: Farnborough International '90\nThis airshow is primarily a trade airshow, with\nmanufacturers from all over the world attempting to\nsell their products. This means that the aircraft on\ndisplay here are frequently the latest types, and are\ndisplayed by pilots who are attempting to 'sell' them\nto the VIPs beneath. Quite a few aircraft are rarely\nor never seen in the UK in the usual way-remember\nthe Mig-29s in 1988? The disadvantage of this is that\nsome of the display consists of aeroplanes that,\nalthough new, are fundamentally boring for show\npurposes. Farnborough can be reached by train from\nWaterloo, and this could well be the cheapest way to\ngo, as car parking and general admission is very\nexpensive.\nBoeing EC-3A Sentry (AWACS). Mildenhall 1989\nPage 24\nthe Battle of Britain\nPhoto Tips\n\u2022 Take plenty of reasonably fast film: although film\ncan be bought at large air shows, you may have to\nwalk a long way to get more.\n\u2022 Compact cameras: it is usually a waste of film to\ntake photos of aircraft in flight as they are only a speck\nin the resulting picture.\n\u2022 Use a high shutter speed for flying aircraft, always\npan and follow through to get a sharp image.\n\u2022 Use a lens hood to stop flare, and always use a protective filter on the lens-you may be showered\nwith tiny oil droplets.\n\u2022 Use a telephoto zoom lens if possible, and don't be\nAlphajets of the Patrouille de France, Mildenhall 1989\nafraid of using the maximum aperture available.\n\u2022 Take pictures when the subject is approaching: rear\nviews, rarely come out well.\n\u2022 Unless you have spot or very advanced metering,\ntry setting your camera by metering on grass/concrete\nin front of you or on your hand, then using exposure\nlock. Frequently re-check the setting, especially if\nthere is cloud cover. Automatic cameras tend to\nproduce well-exposed skies, but the aircraft are\nsilhouettes.\n\u2022 Alternatively, compare meter readings taken on the\ngrass, and on a passing aeroplane, then set the\ndifference on the exposure + / - setting.\n\u2022 Try and stand so that you have a good view,\notherwise heads will intrude into your shots.\n\u2022 Auto-focus cameras: the lens may not focus fast\nenough, so try switching to manual, and setting it to\ninfinity.\n\u2022 Take spare batteries.\n\u2022 Formation teams: let the formation fill the\nviewfinder. Don't waste film on large and loose\nformations, the aircraft only appear as specks.\n\u2022 Smoke trails left behind aircraft can make effective\npictures.\n\u2022 It is extremely difficult to get a good shot of the Red\nArrows' sync ro pair because of the time delay\nbetween pressing the shutter release and the shutter\naction occurring.\n\u2022 Don't assume everyone around you is an expert:\nphotographic poseurs abound at air shows. Stunning\npictures can be obtained on basic SLRs.\n\u2022 It can be helpful to write down aircraft types as you\ntake photos, otherwise you may end up with a pile\nof unidentified aircraft pictures.\nA GUIDE TO AIRSHOWS DURING THE SUMMER\nMEETING COST OF ADMISSION (approx)\n12/13 May-North Weald\nFighter Meet 1990\n\u00a3 7 at gate on foot\n\u00a3 4 in advance\n26/27 May-Mildenhall\nAir Fete '90\n\u00a3 1 0 per car (regardless\nof number of occupants)\n16/17 June-Biggin Hill\nInternational Air Fair\nCar Parking\n\u00a3 7 at gate\n\u00a3 5 in advance\n\u00a3 0 Saturday, \u00a3 3 Sunday\n(discount for 12 or more especially in advance)\n27 August \u2014West Mailing, Kent\nGreat Warbirds\nNo prices available yet\n7-9 September \u2014Farnborough\nFarnborough International '90\n\u00a3 1 1 adult\n\u00a3 3 car\nKeith Prowse give discount for 20 people or more\nPage 25\n\n"

    "content": "Battle Of The Bands\nThe idea of a sleazy night out in a smokey room with\nlive entertainment appealed, so yours truly.braved the\nelements and took a trip to the glamourous setting of\nthe UCH to find out what exactly this cabaret was all\nabout. After one or two mi sad van ture s on route, I arrived to be greeted by the sight of a not-so-smokey\nroom, with the promised crush bar, and even chairs\nand tables to sit at/fall off, depending on the stage\nof the night's proceedings.\nThe Splendid were just taking the stage as I entered,\nand proceeded to play a set of punk ish indie rock. The\nsongs were played well, and a few brave souls were\nencouraged to take to the dance floor immediately in\nfront of the stage. The final song of the set, apparently\nabout Rolo's received a mixed response, but the\nSplendid left a good overall impression on the crowd,\nwho were pretty good-natured all night.\nAfter a brief interval during which the Operatic\nSociety donated a bit of culture to the evening with\na few 'proper' songs, the Fractals came on and gave\nus an excellent mixture of music, with covers of the\nGreens, The B52's, The Doors' Light My Fire and\nending with a good rowdy vers on of the Troggs' Wild\nFractals\nThing, with vocalist Andy Poole performing with only\na plastic crocodile on his person! No prizes awarded\nfor guessing where he wore this article! I A really good\nset, and a name to remember, if only for the style of\ntheir exit!\nThe gap between bands was this time filled with\nan act entitled Faking Ecstacy, in the guise of solo\nThe Bible + The\nFour of Us\n-T& CC 6.3.90\nFirstly there were five of them, explained by the fact,\naccording to their vocalist that they were Irish. They\nwere indeed very Irish, very noisy and very keen. A bit too keen, all five of them being so eager that the\nsongs which sounded so tight on the album declined\ninto a morass of sound under which the vocals were\noften buried. The sound itself was somewhere\nbetween the Stranglers, the Stones and The\nPsychedelic Furs. I think when they grow up they're\ngoing to be very big.\nThree songs (each a perfect, clinical, note for note\nrendering) into The Bible I was wondering why I hadn't stayed at home and listened to the LP (or better still\nthe CD it was the sort of music to play when Dire\nStraits feels too rocky). Then something wonderful\nhappened; the guitarist found his wah-wah, the\nrhythm section slipped up a gear, shirts were flowery\nand everything was groovy (Man!). A string of old\nsongs, new songs and the almost hits (Graceland,\nCrystal Palace, Honey be Good) were zipped through\nwith passion and a good time was had by all.\nROG.\ny^l iS I: The Splendid\nfemale vocalist Becka. Highlight of her show was a rending of Tears on my Pillow, performed with the\nSimon Hartley Backing Dancers. It was a lot more\ninteresting than Kylie, believe me!\nThe crowd were expectant following her depart u tre, and were soon satisfied with the appearance of The\nRest of Us. They played a combined set of well-known\nrock 'n' roll covers, including excellent ver sons of Led\nZeppelin's Rock and Roll, Johnny B Goode and U2's Where the Streets and some of their own songs. The\nRest of Us were the most popular band of the night\namongst the dancers at least, mainly due to the\nfamiliarity of the material, and the audience were\nimpressed enough for them to encore at the end of\nthe set.\nThe next 'in-between' act turned out to be a juggler,\nwho kept us suitably amused until the arrival of Pale\nHorse. They were also one of the more popular acts\nof the evening with their mixture of indie rock songs,\nincluding the moody Abstract Empathy, The Anti Song\nand ending with the absolutely mega Purple Haze.\nSome of the dancers were again encouraged to take\nto the floor, and Pale Horse received a good response\nfrom the crowd despite their inability to supply an\nencore at the end of their show, apparently due to\nequipment failure.\nNext person on to provide a filler was Simon\nHartley, who, upon admitting to being a long-time fan\nof Bros, played a song dedicated to the gruesome\ntwosome entitled Fuck Us We're Famous. Enough\nsaid!!\nThe Mysterons came on next, and left posing one\nof the great questions of the universe. How can a band\nperform so well together, play decent songs, and\nreceive such a bad response from the crowd? My\nsuggestion is that the audience in question were not\ntoo keen on the punk/thrash of the Mysterons, which\nwas maybe not all that suitable considering the\nsetting, and as a result a decent band did not receive\nthe recognition of their efforts that they deserved.\nBetter luck next time lads!\nThe hour grew eth late and the UCH had emptied\nsomewhat by the time the last act of the night, The\nCrystal Field, appeared. They played some great songs\nin the heavy rock/HM mould. With some excellent\nguitar work, the trio performed well on a stage that,\nlike the floor, was rather empty looking with only the\nthree of them on there. However, they played on\nundeterred to the last remnants of the crowd,\nincluding a jam with Simon H on lead guitar, with the\ninevitable solo. Altogether a very good show, and it\nwas rather sad that so few people stayed to see it.\nAnd so the evening finally came to a close.\nPhil\nMixed\nOpinions\nDepeche Mode\n-Violator LP\nViolator is the seventh studio album from Depeche\nMode, following their recent long-awaited chart\nsuccess with the singles Personal Jesus and Enjoy the\nSilence which grazed the Top Ten and drove into it\nrespectively. The Mode have always suffered in the\npress from their early days as showbiz baboons and\nfor not using 'real' instruments. Some critics have\nnever been able to accept a group who write 'real'\nsongs but choose to perform them without resorting\nto the easy course of the six-string. With the rise of\nHouse and its mutant offspring, the Mode have found\nthemselves in the unlikely roles of gurus for electronic\nmusic.\nFor Violator the group have discarded the increasing\ncomplexity and theatrical crescendos of their last\neffort, Music for the Masses and returned to very\nsimple themes, backed with impressively crafted\ninstrumentation. The album opens with World in my\nEyes, which would be dark disco were it not for the\nchoral vocals and the orchestral sweep of the\nbackground. The Sweetest Perfection follows, an\nobsessive love pa en with David Gahan passing the\nvocals to Martin Gore; next up is Personal Jesus, in\na shorter version of its Pump Mix incarnation,\nBolanesque and pounding. Halo is possibly the\nepitome of the Mode's career, a confused black song\nwhich effortlessly glides into Waiting for the Night,\na quiet hymn featuring the famous Depeche religious\nicons. Enjoy the Silence needs no further introduction\nexcept to say that it is oddly out of place here; The\nPolicy of Truth is a bizarre tribute to the joy of\nfalsehood with almost sly vocals over a traditional\nbeat. Blue Dress rolls in with Gore's fixation with\nperversity and a stinging keyboard refrain. The final\ntrack, Clean, is a vast spiralling thing that swirls\nunstop p ably to the album's close.\nViolator is dark, sweet and clean. In the shops from\nthe 19th. Stone\nPage 11\n\n"

    "content": "Day Nursery is a health hazard\nParents who use the Imperial College Day Nursery\nmay be risking their childrens' health, it was claimed\nthis week. The nursery, which occupies the basement\nand ground floor at 8 Princes Gardens, suffers from\npeeling paint and damp plaster work. There is mould\ngrowing in some of the corners and there have been\nunconfirmed reports of silverfish and cockroach\ninfestations.\nThe basement is in the worst state of repair and\nhouses the nursery kitchen and several play rooms.\nBecause of a lack of space, children have to sleep on\nmattresses on the kitchen floor, sometimes as little\nas a quarter of an hour after dinner.\nThe nursery caters for both college staff and\nstudents and employs ten people looking after around\n45 babies and toddlers. The nursery staff complain\nthat the staffing level is inadequate and that absences\nare not always covered. During the lunch break there\ncould be just one person on duty.\nWorried parents have written several letters to\ncollege officials but, until recently, they have had little\nresponse.\nWhen FELIX visited the building earlier this\nmonth, there was a single fire blanket and just three\nobvious fire extinguishers; others were apparently\nkept in an alcove out of the way of the children. When\ncontacted, college health and safety officer Mr Ian\nGillet immediately inspected the building and has\nagreed to install better fire equipment.\nMr Gillet was also asked about the fire exits. The\nbasement has two such exits, one which leads straight\nout onto the street and a second which passes through\nseveral corridors, the Islamic society prayer room,\na court yard and up a flight of steps to emerge next\ndoor. This second exit is not used in the escape drill\nand, Mr Gillet told FELIX, the entire nursery can\nstill be evacuated within a few minutes.\nWestminster council is required to regularly inspect\nthe building for health hazards and has repeatedly\npassed the nursery as safe. Mr Gillet expresses\nsurprise that the council inspectors had failed to notice\nthe damp and the mould. Managing Surveyor of\nResidences, Mr Peter Hallworth, who is responsible\nfor maintenance and repair in Princes Gardens, was\nunavailable for comment.\nParents are charged \u00a3260 per month, although\nImperial College Union does provide a subsidy of\naround \u00a3130 for students. The Rector, Professor Sir\nEric Ash, told FELIX that it is illegal for the college\nto use public funds to finance such a scheme and the\nnursery has to be entirely self financing.\nSir Eric recently visited the nursery and admits that\nconditions there have to be improved and said that\nthe college already helped by letting the building rent\nfree. He suggested that the parents should show some\n'team spirit' by spending some time doing repairs\nthemselves. Lady Ash is on the committee responsible\nfor the nursery.\nMs Sue Thornett who is directly responsible for\nthe nursery also admitted that despite the fact that the\nnursery complied with all safety rules and that all\nequipment is regularly checked and serviced, the\nconditions were not very good 'by today's standards.'\nThis is largely the fault of the building which is far\nfrom ideal and Ms Thornett js currently trying to have\nthe basement nursery moved to drier and healthier\nground floor accommodation.\nSouthside left out Bad lads Security in Southside halls has not been improved\ndespite the forwarding of a plan eighteen months ago.\nThe plan involves moving security officers from the\nentrance under the arch to the direct entrances to the\nhalls.\nMr Geoff Reeves, chief security officer at IC, said\nthat the plan was for a night guard at the FalmouthKeogh entrance. He said that there are usually two\nmen on duty in Southside, and for the two of them\nto keep in contact would entail buying \u00a34,000 to\n\u00a35,000 of equipment. This was up to Mr Peter\nHallworth, Manager of Residences, who was\nunavailable for comment.\nMr Reeves added that at weekends security\nmanpower was stretched fully. He also said that to\nkeep both security men at 'The Gardens' entrance\nunder the arch 'seems illogical' considering this\nentrance to the halls is closed after six o 'clock.\nHe said that he appreciated the anxiety caused by\nthe recent spate of student hall based rapes in the south\neast of the country. So far the Universities of Sussex\nand Kent have suffered, and an intruder was\ndiscovered in a room at Wilson House, a student hall\nbelonging to St. Mary's Hospital Medical School. Mr\nReeves said that the security situation at St Mary's had been improved as many of the rooms' windows\nopen directly onto the street. Locks had been installed\nand challenging facilities implemented.\nSouthside has the lowest crime record of halls of\nresidence at IC, and has more security guards than\nEvelyn gardens which has more students.\nThe security improve met proposal was put forward\nby Dr John Hassard and Professor New, wardens of\nSouthside halls. Dr Hassard said that everybody had\nagreed to it at the time, including Sherfield\nadministration though 'there had been practically no\nprogress over a year' even though he saw 'no technical\ndifficulties'.\nAt the moment the main entrances to Southside halls\nare not guarded by anyone, and rely on the security\nimparted by the magnetic keys.\nTwo men were detained by the police on Friday 9th March after a confrontation in Beit quad during a disco\norganised by ICU Entertainments.\nThe trouble started when the two unnamed men\ntried to enter the disco without paying. The five door\nattendants attempted to refuse them entry. This\nresulted in an attempt to push through, and one of\nthe gate crashers started to assault people.\nThe drunk were removed by Mr Nicholas Marley,\nDuty Officer, and Mr Stephen (BJ) McCabe. As they\nresisted, violence flared. The security men in the quad\ncalled the police, who came in three cars and a van,\nwith a police dog. They offered to clear the building,\nbut this was deemed unn necessary by Mr Marley.\nEverybody else left quietly and the disco was closed\nfifty minutes early at 1.10 am\nStop Press\nThe winners of last night's Guilds interdepartmental\npool and darts contest were the Mechanical\nEngineering team.\nPage 3\n\n"

    "content": "Quireboys\nRed Dogs\n+\n-T& CC 22.2.90\nGetting off the tube at Kentish Town last Thursday\nwas an interesting experience. I 've been to any\nnumber of gigs where the audience is predominantly\nhairy, or swathed in vast quantities of leather and\nspandex, but this was the first time I 've seen headbands present in such profusion and variety. They\ncame in all sizes, shapes and colours, and seemed to\ncorrelate to the dedication of the fans to a 'new'\nband-The Quireboys.\nThe headbands are something of a trademark for\nthe band who, for most people, the only contact with\nwhich has been through their two singles to date Hey\nYou and 7O 'clock. The band has actually been around\nfor a couple of years, but clinched a recording deal\nafter supporting Aerosmith on their recent British tour.\nFor those who haven't heard the singles, The\nQuireboys (who incidentally include UFO singer Phil\nMogg's nephew Nigel on bass) have a style that\nincorporates the Georgia Satellites, Aerosmith, AC/DC\nand lots more into a sound that is currently unique.\nThe band is a six piece, with the unusual presence\nof piano which gives the music a definite variety often\nlacking in the Satellites.\nThe gig on the 22nd was kicked off by Red Dogs,\nwho did a good job in warming up a crowd who were\nreally only interested in the headliners. They play a style of bouncing, heavy rhythm and blues that's both\nprofessional and fun to listen to, with a selection of\ngood melodies that bodes well for a recording deal in\nthe near future.\nAfter the stage had been cleared for the Quireboys,\na bar room set was revealed, albeit with a slightly\ndistressing lack of amps or speakers of any sort. By\nthe theme of It Ain't Half Hot Mum began to play as\nintro, the crowd was literally at fever pti ch, and as\nsoon as the band came on stage, all hell broke loose\nand the lack of visible amps gave the band all the more\nroom for the show. They played with an infectious\nenthusiasm that caught up everyone present and\nswept them along for an hour of continuous rock 'n' roll.\nA combination of really good tunes (like what you\nthought had gone out of fashion with the advent of\nBros and Kylie), excellent performances and a crystal\nclear (but loud!) sound made it a night to remember.\nEven after playing the majority of songs from their\ndebut A Bit of What You Fancy album, they still had\ngood, if not better material to play.\nAl Manthias.\nThe Blue Aeroplanes\n\u2014Swagger LP\nBristol is the home of Concorde. Concorde is not blue.\nThe great mystery is, can Gerard Layley (frontman)\nsing? If he can I hope he won't, as Rodney Allen\n(guitarist) could survive alone. The lyrics often sound\nlike an after-thought to a guitar that literally sweats\nREM, but with the imagination of a bread crumb. The\nchorus of Orange Crush fits beautifully to nearly every\ntrack, especially Your Ages.\nWhat it is on side two (if you get that far) features\nMichael Stipe of REM so expect an effort to be\noriginal. Not a chance. Take any track off Reckoning,\ncarefully remove the vocals and all instruments that\naren't guitars, play at one speed and get a guy called\nGerard to babble mindlessly over it in a pathetic\nAmerican accent and you too can create the same\nendless boredom of Swagger.\nThis album should be dedicated to the REM fan who\nrecords Harbercoat sixteen times on one tape. In fact,\nin a scientific experiment we invited the backing of\nReckoning with Blue Aeroplanes and saw if YOU could\ntell the difference. The climax comes with Jacket\nHangs which is a shame, since it's the first track.\nREM have officially learnt how to write more than\none song. Why couldn't they give some lessons to this\nguy on tour last year? Have they ever heard the word\n'originality'? Careful Boy is totally typical: full of\npowdery clich es and so forgettable, I forgot I was\nlistening to it.\nTo make this LP The Blue Aeroplanes took their EP,\nseparated each phrase of the middle tracks, repeated\nit and after thirty minutes at gas mark 3, came out\nwith an album. Except for Jacket Hangs it's totally\nforgettable. Stick to the EP unless you want to commit\nsuicide by major coronary boredom.\nSJH.\nJohnny Clegg + Savuka\nDue to the media, one assumes that all Black South\nAfricans spend their lives dancing. Every news report\nshows the oppressed masses doing the tribal two-step\nin protest or celebration. It was a surprise that Nelson\nMandela actually walked from prison and has so far\nresisted the urge to shimmy shammy to the world.\nJohnny Clegg, white but effectively a Zulu, showed\nthat this compunction to boogie is not restricted to\nethnic majorities when he turned Hammersmith\nOdeon into a party last Saturday night.\nOne of the unfortunates caught up in the cultural\nboycott of South Africa, he was banned by the\nmusicians' union for having the affront ry to sell\nrecords in his adopted homeland despite his multiracial\nband and political stand-point. However, he is now\nback in the fold and promoting a new LP, Cruel, Crazy\nWorld on the back of his success in providing the\nsoundtrack for Rainman. There was a strong bias\ntowards the newer material in the show but little\nevidence that its amalgamation of the Western and\nAfrican styles is unpopular with his fans despite such\n\u2014Hammersmith Odeon\ncriticism in the press.\nIt was the older familiar songs that really generated\nthe at mos per e and elicited most noise from the large\nSouth African contingent at the back. Highlights were\nThird World Child, The Berlin Wall, Skies of South\nAfrica and / Call Your Name, the last from his African\nShadowman album which really broke him in the rest\nof Europe. In addition to their flamboyant stage garb,\ncolour was also provided by the traditional Zulu\ndancing by Clegg and, in particular, vocalist Mandissa\nDlanga, the large 'fire at the heart of Savuka'.\nClegg's songs are political but joyous in comparison\nwith the protest songs of Western musicians.\nCounterpoint was accurately provided by his own\nchoral Mandela song in memory of those for whom\nthe struggle has cost them their lives. The man who\ncan effectively transmit that message without ruining\nthe carnival atmosphere he had created showed that\nhe is leading the way in breaking down the barriers\nrather than just riding the Anti-Apartheid bandwagon.\nCDL.\nPale Saints + Real People + Ride ULU 8.3.90\nOh no-another set of boring supports to endure\nbefore Pale Saints. But no-Ride, warming-up for the\nnext day, were our entre.\nRide were simply beautiful. The two guitars are\neven more scorching than on vinyl and Mark's boyish,\nserene vocals add to perfection. Anoraks flapped in\nunison and grown men swooned as Mark gazed over,\nlost in a smooth hurricane of bliss. The eternal half-hour gushed with old and new. They played from their\nforthcoming EP, but these were greeted as favourites\nlearnt back in November when Ride and Pale Saints\nlast stormed through ULU. Bowl-tops and goths\npulsed to Drive Blind and melted to Chelsea Girl, and\nthen Ride were gone with their dream.\nThe reality of tedious indie-pop returned via some\nReal People. In the crowd, one read the paper, one\ndid his computing and one just looked like a goldfish.\nThey should be dragged off to Scallie-land with the\ntwo Trevors who danced along.\nThen we fell back to fantasy with 40 minutes of\nunstoppable sound from Pale Saints. The lyrical bass\nfloats through a mist of guitar and syncopated rhythm,\nguided by another hazy stare and boyish vocals from\nIan. The songs are more complex and melodic than\nRide and reminiscent of a harmonic My Bloody\nValentine.\nThey re-enacted (they cannot merely play) mostly\ntheir recent LP which is still mainly unknown. The first\nroar rose for Time Thief from the EP, and the fever\ngrew to the climax and finale, and their finest, She\nRides The Waves. An Inspiral Carpets girl (obviously\nfollowing lan's haircut) crazed on the speaker stack\nwhich rattled and buzzed at the limit, as two Jaguars\nwere pounded thrashing and screaming to their\nextreme. They couldn't leave forever after that, so\nencored with the calmer Sight Of You, leaving us\nsatisfied and sweaty, floating on a stream of ecstasy.\nMust we wait another 4 months for the priv el edge of seeing Ride and Pale Saints together again? Totally\nmomentous.\nSJH\nPage 12\n\n"

    "content": "The Calumny Column ST\nFelicitus\nIt's curious what you can see simply by hanging\naround Beit Quad these days. The oddest sight was\ncurrent President Neil McCluskey and President-elect\nPaul Shanley attempting to avoid someone who had\nwalked into the FELIX office. Trapped in the back\noffice, their only exit was via the ground floor\nwindow. The difference was that Mr Shanley was not\nwearing a suit at the time.\nTwo applicants in a Southside hall will receive a surprise in a few days time when next year's re-apps\nare announced. They have been struck off the list\nbecause they flan ned their sub warden at the hall\ndinner.\nTwo weeks ago Union President Neil McCluskey\nwas coming home with two members of the dance\nclub. The taxi driver, eager to abide by the law,\nrefused to allow Mr McCluskey to pay by cheque.\nDespite the president's protestations, the driver\nstopped the cab on the Hanger Lane gyratory system.\nMr McCluskey spent half an hour in the taxi before\nthe driver would let him go.\nLast week, a huge party was due to be held in the\nlounge. Labelled the 'Acid Rave', it was advertised in\nother London colleges. On the night in question, there\nwas no lighting in the quad due to a fault in the timer\nswitches. The duty officer, Doug King, realising that\nthere was a problem, promptly appointed another duty\nofficer and made arrangements to get emergency\nlighting installed. At considerable expense the\nDramsoc lights were used-all 2kW of them. The shift\nengineer was also telephoned to arrange emergency\nlights for the entrance to the quad to enable card\nchecks to be done. He eventually turned up with a60W light bulb on a piece of extension cord.\nEventually, when all the preparations had been made,\nthe party could begin. 12 people turned up.\nA brief question : Why did Union Deputy President\nDave Williams spend the entire weekend hiding in his\nroom from David Cornwall, Chairman of AfroCaribbean Society?\nApproximately eighteen months ago, the Sherfield\nMain Dining Hall was refitted at a cost rumoured to\nbe in the region of \u00a320K. The plans were designed not\nby the College estates section nor the refectories\nsection, but by the Rector's wife, Lady Clare Ash. It\nnow seems that the MDH is to undergo another refit.\nThis time the cost is rumoured to be as much as \u00a330K. The architect? Lady Clare Ash.\nLots of swear words were heard in the corridors\nnear Catering Manager Rob Northey's office last\nMonday. This followed an event held in the JCR the\nprevious weekend by our very own Indian Society.\nFollowing the mess left by the Chem Eng dinner the\nweekend before, Honest Rob's nerves were left even\nmore frayed by having to clear up gallons of red paint\nfrom the walls and floor of the JCR. Perhaps its time\nfor Rob to reconsider the job offer that he is holding...\nThere are two loopholes in Union bye-laws that are\nabout to be made open. One states that a sabbatical\ncan take a second term in office provided that they\nfinance themselves. This presumably enables anyone\nto run again if they can obtain sponsorship. The\nsecond loophole enables anyone to run if they are an\noccasional student (a la Howgate). How fitting then,\nthat an ex-sabbatical is about to enrol on an MBA\ncourse with a view to running for Deputy President\nthis term.\nFriday's Stagefright gig saw Ents Chairman, 'BJ'\nMcCabe, in fine form. With the entire union t annoy system at his disposal, Mr McCabe announced the\nPage 26\nby Caroline Toynbee\nsupport band 'The Hogfuckers.' The guests at the\ngliding club dinner in the union dining hall probably\ndidn't see the funny side; the average age of the\ndiners was 50.\nMeanwhile the RCS are bumbling along with their\nplans for the Silwood ball, which won't be held at\nSilwood park. Tradition dictates, of course, that we\nshould all still refer to it as the Silwood ball, despite\nthe most likely venue suggested, the Queen's Lawn.\nRumours indicate that RCS Ents Chairman and future\nRCS president, Sid Hiiemae hopes to have a band in\nthe Queen's Tower, food in the main dining hall and\ndancing on the lawn. Tres Chic, Sid, but you won't be getting many takers at \u00a350 for that.\nWith an imminent change in the accommodation\noffice approaching the knifes are being sharpened.\nThe residence finance group are to be transferred from\nthe Sherfield building to 15, Princes Gardens, to aid\ncommunications between them and the\nac com mod at on office. Are there any secrets to hide?\nWho knows. The shredding machine in the\naccommodation office ran into overdrive last week,\nhowever. Rumours that Loretto O 'Callaghan spent her\ntwo week break attempting to find a new job are\ntotally unfounded.\nOdds for future president, Paul Shanley, passing his\nfinals now stand at 6-4 on, in the Holbein House\nbetting consortium. Mr Stapleton, FELIX Editor-elect,\nstands somewhat lower at 10-1 against.\nRob Northey is clearly worried about the success\nof the newly-vamped Union Snack Bar. On Monday,\nalong with the Sherfield Supremo, Angus 'House of\nFraser, he carried out are conn a is ance operation on\nthis outlet. Rumours that their entourage included a video cameraman are said to be strongly denied. FELIX\ntelephoned the refectories office to discover if there\nwas a connection between the raid and Rob's plans\nto turn the outlet into a Taco Bar. The reply was 'Rob\nWho?'.\nFinally, Paul Shanley bared all last week when he\nwas stripped naked in the union bar. Avid\nphotographers were on the spot to catch a rare sight\nof Mr Shanley's oratory end as it was shown to the\nworld. The pictures should be appearing in Pig Farmers\nWeekly soon.\nAnd it came to pass in the land of Imperi'al that the\nrulers of the people had become tired and the time did\napproach for new rulers to come forth. And lo there\nwas much indifference. And the people of Imperi'al\ndid rend their clothes for it was trendy so to do, and\nthe Japanese did flagrantly ignore wildlife treaties and\nthere was much whaling and gnashing of teeth.\nAnd a great darkness did fall upon the land and the\npeople of Imperi'al did hide themselves away for a terrible blight was visited upon them. And the plague\nof posters did last for forty days and forty nights. Or\nat least it seemed like it. And the people would not\nwalk without for fear of someone saying unto them\n'Hi, I'm Paul Shanley, let me tell you about my plans\nfor IC Union next year...'\nAnd lo, the time did come when new rulers did\ncome forth from the people and many of those who\ndid covet the thrones did break the eleventh\ncommandment which saye th 'thou shalt not break\nelection rules unless Fiona be too lazy to say anything\nabout it.' And Ritsperis did say unto the people 'I know eth the word of God' and lo, it was a shame that\nno one would listen to him. And Doug who could\nspeak no bulls h*t did go unto the people and the\npeople did say unto him, 'if thou can bulls h*t not why\non Earth are you standing for President for is it not\na requirement of the job?' And from the left did come\nOrrow-Whiting but, lo, I can not think of anything\nfunny to say about him.\nAnd from the office of FELIX did come a cry, for\nWyatt of the tribe of Margaret who believe th in the\nPoll Tax and Student Loans and who are indeed\nresponsible for landing the people of Imperi'al in the\nshit, did covet the throne of Smedley. And Wyatt did\nsay unto the tribe of FELIX 'I know how to run a newspaper better than you do so nah-nah-ni-nah-nah.'\nBut the people of Imperi'al were not quite that stupid.\nAnd Stapleton who did also covet the throne of\nSmedley, did say unto the people of Imperi'al, 'let me\nhave the throne of Smedley and I will smite the\ndiabolical Ash with my velvety e pee'. And the people\nof Imperi'al did look in a dictionary and did discover\nthat 'excel lant' was not spelt like that.\nAnd the people did chose Shanley of the out of date\nrail ticket and they did also choose Williamson of the\npullover and Stapleton of the purple prose. And yet\nthe throne of Williams did remain empty for the people\nhad look'd and said 'who the hell is new election\nanyway?'. And there was still much indifference.\n\n"

The lead\nsinger seemed to possess the energy of the whole\nband and could well have been the bastard son of\nMick Jagger. Evident from the way he prowled so\na gil y around the stage; a cross between an Egyptian\non E and a headless ostrich! As a support band with\nno pos sibi lt iy of an encore they made their own\nalternative; instead of leaving the stage, the stage\nlights were turned off until there were enough shouts\nto turn them back on again, and so they continued.\nFarcically funny, who cares about the music?\nNext came... Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine\n(Jimbob and Fruitbat), with their uncanny mix of\nvocals, guitars and backing tracks of drums, bass,\nsynth and various samplers. They are presently riding\nhigh, victims of a recent music media frenzy.\nWhat was decipherable through the crap sound\nsystem was excellent, but it was only the general\nmomentum which carried, with the cutting vocals and\nlyrics ritually massacred. The guitars, which create a 'foreground' or 'backdrop' to each track were reduced\nto an inconsequential 'fuzz.' Still unperturbed, they\nplayed a set leading us by the scruff of the neck,\nthrough the life and attitudes of the 80's, and on to\nthe 90's. Beginning with Everytime the Churchbell\nrings they continued with Midnight on the murder mile\nand Sheriff Fatman amongst others, and concluded\nwith A perfect day to drop the bomb.\nReplacing such serious music with a far more\nfrivolous attitude were the Senseless Things, who\nJesus Jones\n\u2014Real Real Real 12 \"\nThe new single from the Joneses comes as rather a disappointment. After the early promise they showed\nwith singles like Info Freako with its eclectic mix of\nsample and guitar noise they appear to have run low\non initiative.\nThis record still has the odd little electronic\neru ct at ions but rather than flaunting themselves over\nthe more traditional instruments they are incorporated\ninto the mix at a deeper level, losing some of their\ncharm. The exuberant vocals sound out of place\nagainst the almost pedestrian backing. On the plus\nside, one side of the 12\" is a competent (but not\nbrilliant) mini-anthem; the other sounds like a slightly\ntripped-out House number. Too polished for their own\ngood.\nStone.\nplayed a near non-stop forty-five minute set. Each\nsong bounded merrily into the next with the energy\nof four hyperactive youths, but carrying the same lack\nof maturity in their material. They sound like The\nPrimitives, though far faster plus extra guitarist, male\nvocalist and much more vitality.\nStill the lemmings were out in force, seemingly\noblivious to the stifling s we af box atmosphere.\nMost of the material was from their relatively\nsuccessful Postcard CV LP, plus new work from their\nmini-LP, Andy in a Karmann, to be released this\nmonth. The catchy songs which stick in the mind\nwere Girlfriend, Trevor and Too much kissing,\nalthough there were many more forgettable tunes.\nWith all that vigour and time on their hands, they\nhave every chance of doing something less superficial,\nif they want to.

But rather like a rasher of\nstreaky bacon, the humour alternates with a touchingly human story.\nSix southern women (played by such silver screen\ngems as Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Shirley Maclaine,\nOlympia Dukakis, Daryl Hannah and last but not least\nDolly Parton) find it nigh impossible to hide anything\nfrom each other. Shelby (Sally Field) is a serious\ndiabetic. She decides against the wishes of her mother\n(Julia Roberts) to have a child despite doctors'\ncategorical warnings not to. It's obvious right from the\nvery beginning that there's a life support machine with\nher name on it, so there's no surprise when after\ncharting several years of Shelby's thirst for the best\nin life the film closes with her untimely demise.\nThe meat of the film though is Shelby's and the rest\nof the unlikely stories determination and will to\nsurvive.

A truly appalling set\nof auditions ensue from which they pick Susie\nDiamond (Michelle Pfeiffer). Getting off to a shaky\nstart, she soon re vital is es the act with her own unique\nbrand of performance. Then a relationship starts to\ndevelop between Jack and Susie, much to Frank's later displeasure.\nThis is not a film for the lover of intricate plots. The\nplot is there, but is extremely rudimentary. Instead we\nhave one of those relationship movies that are so in\nvogue these days. Jeff Bridges and Michelle Pfeiffer\nprovide the necessary 'drool factor' for Box Office\nsuccess while the small supporting cast are adequate\n(especially the dog). Unfortunately, despite the actors'\nbest efforts we never really start to care for the\ncharacters and the whole thing ambles pointlessly but\neffortlessly.\nThe ending is inconclusive and leaves one feeling\nthat the last reel has been misplaced. The only\nunequivocally memorable scene is the one where Ms\nPfeiffer sings 'Makin' Whoopee' while cavorting\naround on a piano.

The\nproject coordinator, Dr Wilkin, assured us the projects\nassigned would be given in the order of choices alone.\nWhen the lists of designated projects were put up\nI found I'd received none of my choices but stilt had\na project studying proteins. 1 later found out that my\nfirst choice was given to a another student, who had\nonly put the project down as his third choice, I asked\nDr Wilkin about the situation, stating it's unfairness,\nand he replied it was the only way the project could\nbe assigned. I 've also seen about half a dozen other\nlecturers and they've generally agreed it's unfair, but\ndidn't offer me any support.\nout the form, I 've had a project dumped on me which\nno one else wants. Now the projects have been\nassigned, however unfairly, no one in the department\nMsti'i!.; te/\".'\nOK, get\nthe message\nDear Dave,\n' .vi:'- ];'. ii!w;'. f ii \u00a5-.:i.>; fi\u00bbl> ii;';:\n' /<<\u2022\u2022 \u2022:\u2022\u2022\u2022'>:\u2022; iff-- ..!;\u2022;>*;,>';>\u2022\nBefore we chose the projects we were assured by\n\u2022\nassigned simply by the preferences expressed by the\nstudents. Since the allocation it appears that such\nfactors as the project supervisors choice of student,\nand whether they are definitely going on to do a PhD\nhave also influenced the process.\nSome people have said that it is right for those going\nto do PhDs to get the best projects. What about those\npeople who are unsure whether to go into research or not-and will make that decision based on their\nexperience in the lab in this project.\nI, like several other people, received none of my\npreferences and then had to rush around finding\nanother one. Luckily I have managed to organise one\nmyself at St Mary's, thanks to Dr Hardy, but at least\none other person is still to find one. I hope next year\nthe organisation of the allocation will be slightly better.\nC Talbot.\nDubious\nDear Dave,\nThe recent wave of popular revolts against the Pott\nTax have arisen purely out of a deep seated anger.\nThe fundamental reason is patently obvious -this tax\nconstitutes an enormous shift of wealth from the poor\nto the rich.\nNot surprisingly, media attention has focussed on\nthe so-called 'rent-a mob' activities of far left groups.\nHowever, simple consideration of the numbers\ninvolved in these uprisings indicate a far larger\nparticipation: Militant, one of the groups indicted has\nan entire membership of about 10,000; only a thousand more than Gloucestershire Anti-Poll Tax\nFederation, and certainly far less than the numbers\ninvolved in demonstrations nationwide.\nNevertheless, it is true that there have been dubious\nelements present. Groups of outside political\nagitators, hell bent on violence, have lit the fuse that\n' has ignited the anger and rage of the masses. If\npossible, stay well clear of these well-heeled\nprofessional thugs. They are from outside of the\ncommunity, heavily armed with shields and\ntruncheons, and can be easily recognised by their blue\nuniforms and black helmets.\nKinnock expects the people simply to put up with\nthe Poll Tax until the next general election. However,\nwe don't have to wait; demonstrators around the\ncountry certainly aren't prepared to! Many people\nhave no choice; they can't pay, won't pay and will\ndo their utmost to stop the tax.\nThatcher's attitude to this un democratically enforced tax has been nothing less than sickening.\nThe Poll Tax will be beaten by a campaign of mass\nnon-payment,\nE Denny (Aeronautics PG}, C Wong (Physics 31, I Widdows (Physics 3), R Banerjee (MSE 2).\nHypocrisy\nDear Dave,\nAn interesting point was raised at Prime Minister's Question Time (Thurs 8th): would the people\nadvocating breaking the law by not paying their Poll\nTax be prepared to break any other laws or not pay\nany other taxes? I don't remember anyone protesting\nabout rates-a ridiculous system whereby property\nmattered more than people, and half the adult\npopulation paid nothing at all towards the upkeep of\ntheir community. Why not protest against income\ntax -a cruel and evil system that punishes hard work d and stifles enterprise? Most people pay far more\nincome tax than Poll Tax, so why is the former\ntolerated?\nNo one likes rates, but what are the alternatives?\nLabour favours a 'Roof Tax'. Details are rather non-existent, but it seems to be a tax on your house, not\ndissimilar to rates. (This is mostly speculation, since\nthe Labour Party hasn't formally decided on its\nscheme.) Why tax a house? Does a house use the\nroads? Go to the park? The library? Swimming?\n\u2022 Mou sly a credible system must concentrate on\nfl ppl e, not where they live.\nThe smaller parties favour a li \u2022\u2022. ni income tax. I don't like this prospect. Apart from having no bearing on\nsj^e amount you spend, there is a danger of wage\nearners moving out of areas where the local tax is\nhigh, meaning increased financial burdens on people\nwho remain.\nThe Con il unity Charge isn't popular among people\nwho have to pay more mw than through rates\n(Including the 17 million people who didn't pay any\nrates). This isn't sur pri siu although most people's bills are artificially high bi 'use of extravagance and\ninefficiency in their local co j nc il. Is it really wrong that\npeople should pay for what the council they elected\nspends? If you want to pay ks s, elect a more efficient\ncouncil, Labour or Conservative.\nBack to the original point. Thiitv or\nso Labour MPs\nsay they aren't going to pay their Poll Tax. What\nwould they say if Tory MPs is ed to pay Labour's Roof Tax? The sheer hypocrisy is damning.\nWe students as responsible adults must pay our fair\nshare of local community spi 'ig If you don't like\nthe Community Charge, vote for an alternative next\ngeneral election. Violence and not n.,j achieves nothing\nbut sadistic gratification for members cf Militant.\nYours sincerely,\nUltan McCarthy, Physics 2.\nHarbouring a grudge\nDear Dave,\nI have just been reading your manifesto of last year.\nI quote: 'The first cause to which any FELIX Editor\nmust devote himself is the accurate reporting of\nnews at IC, with the backing of fair editorial\ncomment.'\nHow things change!\nYours sincerely,\nJ M Scott.\nPage 29\n\n"

    "content": "Racing Demon\nThe twentieth century has been chipping away at the\nrock of the Church of England. David Hare's latest play\nreveals a Church at near crisis point; Faced with such\nobjects of contention as women priests and\nhomosexual tolerance plus dwindling attendance;\ndown to less than 1%, there are no easy answers.\nThe Reverend Lionel Espy, who resides over a typical deprived inner-city parish, is beginning to\nquestion his faith. But with such a crisis, now is not\nthe time to doubt. He is highly involved in work in the\ncommunity and tends to preach humanity rather than\nreligious sincerity. However, according to Tony, his\nfire and brimstone curate and the conservative\nbishops above him.this is not the way to pull the\ncrowds. Tough, Thatcheresque, Anglican\n'fundamentalism' is the tonic they prescribe.\nTheir uncompromising stance is however\ncontradicted when it comes to policy making at the\nGeneral Synod where they produce a form of wish y was hy liberalism with no genuine conviction. Two of\nLionel's friends, eccentric but lovable 'Streaky' and\nhomo sexually leaning Harry, battle with Lionel against\nthis formidable opponent whilst Frances, Tony's ex-girlfriend, exposes in a heartfelt tone the Chruch's apparent lack of humanity.\nThis all makes for a piece of extremely absorbing\nand exhilarating drama, also endowed with a vibrant\nBook\nWith Passport\nand Parasol\nby Julia Keay\nAll the famous explorers of the Victorian age were\nmale, or so they were portrayed by a very sexist and\nelitist society.\nWhile Livingstone was hacking through the jungles\nof Africa searching for the source of the Nile, women,\nall of 'good stock', were only a few years behind.\nThe book contains seven travel-logs, each a brief\nnarration of a ladies travels in a world far removed\nfrom the present day's package holidays, with the\nassociated delays and worries. Each was an\nindependent traveller, looking down at the people who\nwere on one of Cook's early tours, there was a great\ndeal of snobbery involved in foreign travel.\nOne pre-requisite of going on any such journey was\nto have a very comfortable standard of living, indeed\nbeing filthy rich was the norm, not the exception. The\nmoney for the trip need not be your own, being the\nwife of the effective ruler of India always helps.\nTravel was extravagant in Victorian times, even an\n'independent' traveller would have some companions,\na friend and perhaps some sort of protector but\n12,000 people is a bit excessive!\nEach story is different from the last, although they\ndo tend to be a bit boring in places, going into mindless\ndetails that do not make a good story. Extract of each\nof the traveller's own logs are contained in with the\nmain text; showing the old style of writing, particularly\nof supposed 'upper class' people.\nThe book is from a radio series broadcast on radio\n4 but self-contained.\nAs an overall comment I would say that it is\nreasonable, not compelling but also not deadly boring.\nIan Hodge.\nPage 6\nTheatre\nsense of humour, interesting staging and outstanding\nacting. Hare's acute observations are numerous and\nrelevant to both secular and religious society-through\nthem he doesn't so much moral is e about the Church\nas offer constructive advice-compassion, tolerance\nand clear-sightedness should all be watchwords for\nthe Nineties. The one problem is that this superb\nproduction is sold out until April (at least) so there will\nbe no student standbys: Pray for tickets!\nThe National Theatre box office is on 928 2033.\nAdrian Pagan\nJoe Turner's71 Come and Gone\nSeth and Bertha Holly's quiet life is disturbed by the\narrival of a new boarder, Herald Loomis. He has a problem and it looks like Bynum, regarded as slightly\nmad by most, is the only one that can help...\nJoe Turners' Come and Gone is by August Wilson, the\nauthor of the highly acclaimed Ma Rainy's Black\nBottom and deals with similar themes. Set in a black\nboarding house after the Emancipation Proclamation,\nit tells of the way all its residents' lives inter mesh and\nespecially of one particular boarder's quest to bury the\npast by finding his wife. The play is superbly\nwritten-the dia lou ge is extremely convincing and\nthere is a wonderful use of symbolism the whole way\nthrough. The cast are all superb down even to the\nchildren and with the imaginative lighting effects one\nis transferred Pittsburgh for the course of the play.\nTotally engrossing it is a gem that is not to be missed\nat any cost.\nIt is playing at The Tricycle Theatre, 269 Kilburn\nHigh Road, NW6. Nearest tube is Kilburn (surprise,\nsurprise) and concessionary tickets cost \u00a31.50 MonWen and Sat matinee, \u00a35.00 Thu, Fri. On Mondays\nthe first 50 people who turn up pay what they can turn up around 7 O 'clock.\nAdam T. New Anatomies\nTheatre\nThe last in the trio of plays directed by women,\nrunning at the Man in the Moon Theatre Club, New\nAnatomies, tells the story .of the life of Isabelle\nEberhandt-a female Lawrence of Arabia.\nBorn in Switzerland at the turn of the century\nEberhandt fled convention and, disguised as a man,\nlived as a nomad in the desert of Algeria.\nThe play spans her whole life, from an unhappy\nchildhood in Geneva, the daughter of a Russian\nRevolutionary, through the fulfillment of her dream to\ntravel in the desert, to her tragic and bizarre death at\nan early age.\nThe plays begins with Eberhandt delirious with fever\nat the start of her tragic downfall which sets the mood\nfor the play and arouses interest.\nShe was a highly imaginative and widely read child\nand with her background revealed to us we can easily\nunderstand the course of her life.\nHow factual this modern play by Timberlake\nWestenbahen is, I don't know but, especially with the\ninterpretation by the director, it seems to be more\nconcerned with symbolism than realism.\nThere are nineteen roles, both male and female, in\nthis play, and they are divided between six actresses.\nThe director obviously believes it emphasises certain\npoints-to do with symbolism, but I do not see that\nthis is necessary. Both this and the homosexual or\nrather anti-convention a list theme that seems to run\nthrough this play due to the director's interpretation,\nin my opinion, detract from the value of the play as\na testimony to Eberhandt. With men in male roles and\na more masculine looking actress as Eberhandt the\nreality of the play would be greatly enhanced and any\npoint that needed to be made could equally well have\nbeen emphasised. Unusual production is very\neffective when necessary, but with over use it can\nbecome bland and lose all its impact.\nThe Man in the Moon Theatre Club, 392 Kings\nRoad, Chelsea, London SW3. New Anatomies is\nrunning in rep until April 28, Tuesday-Sunday,\n8.30pm. Concessionary tickets cost \u00a34. Ring the box\noffice on 351 2876 for more details.\nJLW.\n\n"

In Fisher Hall the re-app selection process is\nfar more stringent, by a panel comprised of elected\nmembers of the Hall committee, giving the\nsub wardens little say in the matter.\nYours sincerely,\nPhilip Horner, Lee Griffin, Andrew Toone, Simon\nParker {re-apps, Fisher Hall).\nLet's all live\nin peace\nDear Dave,\nI am f***** \u00bbgp*s sed off with the recent (last few\nmonths) spates of violence that have been occur ing around 'College events. I now find myself in the\nposition that the friendly and safe campus that I 've\nbragged about to my mother (vice president for\nresearch and graduate studies of a major American\nuniversity) is now a place in which an inoffensive and\nquiet friend of mine gets violently beaten up by five\nyouths on the walkway on a Saturday evening. There\nis a side effect of this that most of you are not aware\nof; late bar licences rely on the good will of the police,\nas does the granting of Rag collecting licences etc.\nLast Saturday's incident has almost certainly cost the\nRCS May Ball it's hoped for 3am licence and has\nprobably screwed up some future IC ents events for\nyou all.\nOK there is the problem, now for the solution. This\nwill be highly unpopular among certain societies but\nI would suggest that any student bodies with a bad\nrecord at their events and all external bodies holding\nparties on College property be forced to pay the wages\nof extra College security guards to nursemaid their\nevents until they become, in Council's view,\nresponsible enough to take their own precautions\nagain.\nIC holds a good reputation in the public eye, don't allow a few irresponsible arse holes to screw it all up\nfor us.\nClaude should have his stitches removed in a few\nweeks, but what if next time it's a flick knife and your\ngirlfriend's face?\nSid, RCS Ents Chairman and Pres Elect.\nDear Dave,\nAfter observing C& GU taking delivery of a nice\nspanking new laser printer and an over the top\nAppletalk network to support their excessive number\nof computers, I was somewhat relieved at Mr\nMcCluskey sharing some of my concerns on the\nmatter. To some, this seemingly joyous event is of\nlittle significance but it caused me to sit back and think\nabout the use of CCU's and some aspects of College\npolicy regarding finance.\nDo the CCUs really represent the students any\nmore, or are they just archaic institutions held onto\nby a few individuals for their self-gratification and CVs\nall in the name of tradition? Do these people latch\nthemselves onto these safe little niches because they\ncouldn't face the pressure of running a proper student\nunion? I'm not saying that the union officers do not\nwork hard at their posts, because I know they do, but\ndo they really supply what is demanded in the Imperial\nCollege of today?\nRegarding the \u00a38,000 earned from the Careers Fair.\nHaving one's own laser printer would be all very well,\nfor the good of the union, but it doesn't half come in\nhandy for printing one's third year project reports, CVs\nand the like. On asking Chris Home about who is\nallowed to use the union computers, he replied; 'Any\nperson in Guilds who takes a specific interest in the\nunion.' It only came to my notice at the beginning of\nthis academic year that Guilds takes daily papers and\nthe Beano, 'to encourage other people to come into\nthe union office and get involved.' It's only taken me\nthree years to find out that they exist, but then I prefer\nto partake of a paper in the general quietness and\ntidiness of the library.\nTalking about papers; Broadsheet, Guildsheet and\nPit should be considered. These are little read, due to\ntheir clique y nature and their general usage as a vehicle for s lagging off the other CCUs in an extremely\nchildish manner. The antagonism between the unions\nFruity\nDear Dave,\nI used to enjoy reading the FELIX letters page; witty\nre post es interspersed with the occasional genuine\npleas from the heart; but now the egotists and ranter s have got hold of it, no more.\nWhy can't people who wish to present arguments\npresent them in a concise no-nonsense style and not\nlittera ry diarrhoea sprawling over nearly a side of A4?\nHow can they expect people to digest their point of\nview when presented so dismally?\nA screaming example of this is Bhartendu Vyas's thesis last week. Not only did Mr Vyas's 'self-justification' bore me stupid, it did nothing to refute\nthe allegation made in the previous FELIX that he was\non one big ego-trip. How can someone who writes ca.\n700 words when 200 are sufficient not claim to be\non an ego-trip? Own goal.\nIn the meantime, while your correspondents get\ntheir acts together, may I suggest the REVIEWS page\nas a far better read?\nHere's power to your elbow!\nAdrian Pagan, Chem 3.\nis perhaps their greatest failing and the biggest cause\nof lack of interest in them. Regarding the above\nmentioned publications, wouldn't it be far more\neconomical for the unions to have their own page in\nFELIX (a fine publication) and hence increase the\nchance of someone actually bothering to read what\nthey have to say. Over the years that I have read\nFELIX, the issue of not enough articles to print seems\nto come up. Is this an answer?\nAnother matter that intrigues me is the issue of\nfinancing the inviolate mascots. Both Jez and Bo have\nbudgets of about \u00a35,000 to keep them running this\nyear (I'm not aware of the budget for the Minesmobile), and this is justified due to the returns for Rag.\nI'm not saying that Rag is not a deserving cause, but\nif they do indeed bring in a good return for Rag,\nshouldn't they be self-financing. I'm sure College\ncould do with \u00a3 10,000 + a year, to be able to afford\na careers librarian, for instance. For a College that is\nfeeling the financial squeeze, doesn't charity start at\nhome?\nFinally, I would like to quote Mr S.G Barton, who\nwrote an article for Broadsheet: 'If you aren't into\nwhat the RCSU does, then suggest something that\nit can do you are into...or carry on w hinge ing and\nwatch 100 years of tradition slowly die.' I would like\nto suggest this; amalgamate the good parts of the\nCCUs into IC Union to produce one corporate body\nthat all the students can relate to. If it is really desired,\nthe tr adit on could be clung onto if the College can\nreally afford it. The College finance committee\nwouldn't believe how much money it would have to\nspend on services to help all the students, instead of\ngiving far too much for the benefit of a few union\nhacks. I'm not the only person at this College that is\nof this opinion.\nYours, soon to receive a tirade of abuse,\nCraig Holmes, 3M. Squash\nDear Dave,\nI write in response to comments by the Squash Club\ncaptain which may have led your readers to think that\nthere have been cut-backs in the Sports Centre.\nOn the contrary, the centre now opens earlier than\npreviously, and the Ladies changing room and the\nmulti gym have both been improved and expanded.\nThe latest development is a ladies exercise class\nusing the multi gym and with qualified instruction.\n(Wednesday evenings 7.15-8.15pm, newcomers\nwelcome.)\nThe South Ken Sports Committee and especially the\nSports Centre staff, often under difficult\ncircumstances, try to maintain and run the Centre for\nthe maximum enjoyment of all users. The modified\narrangements for the Squash Club are to correct an\nover allocation of courts and to ensure that courts\nwhich are booked by club members are subsequently\nplayed upon.\nYours sincerely,\nMr KA Stevens, Chairman S Ken Sports\nCommittee.\nPage 31\n\n"

The winter format consists of two level\npairs and two mixed pairs but, due to a variety of\npartially extenuating circumstances. We could only\nfield a single ladies pair and were thus 2-0 down\nbefore a ball was struck. Hardly the best of starts, we\nput this behind us and in beating Sussex 9-3 the ladies\npair of Sara Harwell and Antonia Gracie performed\nsplendidly to win 6-1, 6-0. This was apparently the\nconclusion of the day's play and the beer flowed.\nHowever, within an hour we were informed that we\nhad to begin our match with Cardiff. Despite the\nladies' predictable sterling effort the men only took\none set from four, that won by the second pairing of\nStefan Fischer and Richard Pereira. The top pair of\nJulian Jones and Carl Edwards continued their dismal\nindividual display with a75,64 loss and Cardiff thus\nlead 5-3 overnight. Our accommodation arrived at the\nlast moment in the form of a floor, hardly ideal\npreparation compared to the other side's guest house\narrangements but we battled on.\nThe morning arrived and Julian and Sara, despite\nthe latter's approaching illness, prepared to play the\nthe crucial match at 9am. As time passed with no\narrival of the Cardiff side talk was of claiming the\nmatch but finally they arrived and played to. a66 finish. This meant a victory over unbeaten Exeter\nwould allow progress to the final stages but Exeter\nladies, all nationally ranked, proved too strong for Sara\nand Antonia's best efforts. Richard and Stefan, with\nthe former swamping the net with admirable skill,\nagain dominated to win comfortably but Carl and\nJulian continued their pathetic, uninspired\nperformance to only draw leaving the score at 3-5 to\nExeter. Julian and Sara played faultlessly to win easily.\nSome dubious pairs seeding by Exeter saw Antonia\nand Stefan lose to a very strong Exeter pair. This left\nthe final match score at 7-5 and Exeter to qualify for\nthe final stages.\nSailing\nRugby Results 1989-90 Season\nIC 1st XV IC 2nd XV\nPlayed 26Played17 Won 20Won9 Lost 6Lost8 Pts for 693Pts for 275\nPts against 215Pts against 168\nTop point scorer 134 Richard Walters\nTop try scorer 25 Simon Eiicknell\nSaturday March 10th saw the valiant IC mob stroll\ninto action at the Wembley Open Team Trophy.\nClearly undaunted by the high winds and absence of\nhalf the regular team, our chaps flew from the line at\ngreat pace, except Liam Moloney, who completely\nfailed to start. Our fortunes declined further during the\nnext race when, owing to our recurring wind\nproblems, all our boats capsized-much to our mirth.\nSome boiled Pedigree Chum for lunch and a helm\nchange later we returned to the fray, but a surreptitious course change by the organisers and a convincing U boat impression marred our winning\nform, and we returned once more unto the beach joint\nsecond-from last with two of six races won-in the\nsailing, only to storm to victory in the 'scoff the\nsandwiches' competition.\nICESC\nEarlier in the year there was an article in FELIX about\nthe ICESC (Imperial College European Sailing\nChallenge), which was seeking industrial sponsorship\nto take part in the Spi Dauphinne Regatta, which takes\nplace in the South of France during the second week\nof April. The syndicate has now raised sponsorship\nworth \u00a315,000. Project documents in two languages\nwas only one part of the very strong campaign, in\nwhich over fifty companies were approached. Most\nlikely, sponsorship has been secured for next year as\nwell, with another sponsor, which for now has to be\nunnamed. This sponsorship will be worth about three\ntimes as much as the amount raised for this race! This\nyear the syndicate will participate in the race with\nSymbol MIS, a high tech, computer company, as the\nmain sponsor for their syndicate. Many thanks to\nthem for working with us, and we will not disappoint\nthem! The photo below is of the famous % to nner By\nThe Way, on which one of the syndicate members\nRory Barrett, one of the UK's and Ireland's best\nbowmen, has raced.\nIC and local councils\nImperial College has a residence problem. Fair enough,\nso does every other college in London. But ours is\nespecially pressing, because, let's face it, we don't get on well with the locals. When Southside was built,\nthere was serious opposition to the top five floors\nfrom the mews behind it-it is possible that only the\nway that the boundary between two council wards\nlies between Southside and those mews prevented\nthe protests of the residents from stopping planning\npermission.\nCome to think of it, there are problems with a lot\nof the interactions between local government and IC.\nPlanning is a clear one; so is licensing. When it comes\ndown to it, the Council is probably unwilling to back\nCollege against the wishes of the local residents;\ngiven that the Council is made up of those very\nresidents, it's not difficult to see why.\nWell, there's the problem. What to do?\nAll the halls in Prince's Gardens,and Beit, and\nMontpelier, lie within the Knightsbridge ward of\nPage 32\nWestminster, and contain a total of about 900\nstudents, all of whom are registered as electors by\nCollege. In the last local elections, the two\nConservative councillors returned polled 627 and 612\nvotes respectively. You don't need a Cray to see that\nif the students in those halls turn out to vote, we could\ninstall two councillors of our choice.\nMind you, why bother, when the choice is between\na load of candidates who don't care about college and\na load of candidates who don't care about college?\nOn the other hand, if college people, academics, or\nwardens were willing to stand, would you turn out and\nvote for them? I hope so. In local government\nelections, such as those which will be held just after\nEaster, there's really no point voting for a particular\npolitical party, because local Councils have no effect\non the way central Government acts-in fact, it's very\nmuch the reverse. Instead, the wise vote goes to the\ncandidate with most local interest, whatever his other\nallie g ances. If College people are willing to stand on a College\nplatform, you should turn out and vote. It would be\nfoolish not to, and miss the chance of getting college\na voice.\nMind you, it doesn't stop there. There are 650\nresidents in Evelyn Gardens, and the three councillors\nthat ward can elect were returned with 499, 346 and\n67 votes respectively. 67 votes! All Evelyn residents\nwill be registered to vote by College. If there are IC\ncandidates standing there also, don't waste the\nopportunity to add your voice to the cry to get College\ntaken seriously. Vote IC on May 3rd. And if there are any other students who are local\nresidents, ask the Union whether you fall within these\ntwo wards. If you do, register to vote, and vote\nwisely.\nThe poll tax starts in April; the government will be\nmaking you pay for your vote. Use it, and use it to\neffect.\n\n"

After further research it appears that\nthis was not the case. I apologise for any damage this\nmay have caused and withdraw the allegations made\nconcerning this matter. The comments were based\nupon the words of someone who has now changed\ntheir view of circumstances as they took place.\nThe Sabbaticals\nThe rector's querying of the Union sabbaticals as\nrepresentatives of the students leaves a grave\nquestion to be answered. Do the sabbaticals represent\nthe students or 'The Union'? By suggesting to the\nCollege's governors that the president of IC Union\ndoes not represent the students the rector has placed\na trump card on the table which threatens the\nstudents' negotiating powers with the College. Sir Eric\nknows that Union General Meetings are badly\nattended and he knows that this would seem to\nsuggest a large indifference to the Union on the part\nof the students. If he pushes the point he could well\nwin his case over the Harlington Gravel funds. After\nall, if the Union president does not represent the\nstudents, why should the College's governors listen\nto him?\nAt present, the students' Union is the only form of\nstudent representation to the College. If the rector\nrefuses to acknowledge it as such, where does that\nleave you, the students? The rector has suggested\nthat IC Union hold a referendum on the question of\nhow we spend the money from the Harlington gravel\nextraction. Since the rector wants to see more views\nfrom the students in this area, why not let him know\nhow you feel in other areas? Sir Eric represents the\nCollege on the Committee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals. Do you think he is representing you as\nstudents? If the rector wishes to test the students'\nfaith in the Union sabbaticals as student\nrepresentatives, I suggest he should test their faith\nin him as well. If we do have a referendum on the\nquestion of Harlington, we should also run a question\nconcerning students' faith in the way the rector is\nrunning the college.\nThe Jazz Festival\nDave Williams was wrong to drag out the question of\nAfro-Caribbean Society's room booking for last night.\nHis refusal to act promptly has wasted a great deal\nof Afroc Chairman, Dave Cornwall's time and a lot of\nthe Union's money. Mr Williams knew about the\nCollege Bar Committee decision a month before he\ninformed Afroc that they could not have their room\nbooking. He told Fiona Nicholas, when she confirmed\nthe room booking in February, that he did not believe\nthe College Bar Committee decision would affect the\nunion. He says he did not think that the committee\nhad decided to ban Afroc, Unfortunately, Dave was\nin a minority of one in thinking this.\nDave could have informed Afroc as soon as the\nactual decision was brought to his notice. All he had\nto do was write a letter to Afroc and Fiona, informing\nthem of the committee's decision. He was asked to\ndo this on several occasions by the Union Manager\nand the Union Bar Manager. He carried on regardless.\nEither Mr Williams has a memory like as e ive or he is\nincompetent.

Fielding only seven regulars and forced\nto play balding ex-skipper Pip Peel at full back, IC were\nalways going to be under pressure but the admirable\ncomposure shown by the back four, under the\ndirection of veteran Stu Miller, kept Goldies at bay.\nIn the first half IC were restricted to a few\nspeculative efforts and left to soak up long periods\nof pressure but they came out after the break\nconfident of snatching a winner. Then it all went\nhorribly wrong with a quick break down the left, a deep cross half-volleyed against the bar, and the\nrebound headed home. Momentarily shocked, IC\ndusted themselves off and pulled level within five\nminutes. The ball appeared to cross the line three\ntimes during a goal mouth scramble before Adam\nThomas forced it in to leave no doubt.\nGoldies pressed hard for the winner but could find\nno way through. They failed abysmally with the high\nball, succeeding only in furthering Si Holden's claim\nto a place in the England line-out for Saturday.\nMention must be made of debut men Alan Sinclair,\nPhil Caldwell and especially Chris Ward who all turned\nin superb performances.\nPremier Division\nP WDL FA Pts\nGoldsmiths 13 9 2 2 28 16 20\nGuys 12 8 2 2 28 17 18\nIC 14 8 2 4 26 15 18\nLSE 13 5 1 7 24 25 1\n1\nUC 12 4 3 5 16 21 1\n1\nQMC 12 5 1 6 16 24 11\nKings 11 4 1 6 26 27 9\nNew1231824317 Georges 11 2 1 8 1\n1 22 5\nDivision 1\nP WDL FA Pts\nIC 2 17 1\n1 3 3 34 22 25\nQMC 2 17 8 6 3 37 25 22\nKCH 16 8 6 3 37 25 22\nLH 16 7 5 4 41 31 19\nUC 14 7 1 7 24 28 15\nMiddx/UCH 13 6 2 5 25 29 14\nRSM 15 4 5 6 27 25 13\nRFH 15 4 4 7 24 27 12\nThomas 17 5 2 10 25 28 12\nNew14111224623 Division 2\nP WDL FA Pts\nSOP 16 12 3 1 56 25 27\nKings 2 15 1\n1 2 2 48 26 24\nLSE 2 17 9 3 5 41 27 21\nUC 3 15 7 4 4 35 24 18\nCHX 17 7 3 7 39 32 17\nBans 15 6 3 6 23 23 15\nIC 3 18 5 3 10 29 46 13\nMary's184211314912 Guys 2 16 2 3 11 8 34 7\nBarts 2nds0 IC 6th s3 The team arrived in Sidcup bathed in glorious\nsunshine.

Well no, not really, and\nalthough the 6th s won their fourth match in a row,\ngallant captain Willie was not there to see it. After only\n5 minutes, Willie and the opposition's striker\nhead butted each other in trying to perform one of\nballet's more difficult pirouettes. They were then\ncarted off in an ambulance to have stic he s, but there\nwas more to follow as Mitchell skillfully studded the\nkeeper's chest, badly winding him.\nApart form this, the 6th s dominated the game, led\nby Narinda, the stand-in captain, and it was he who\nset up Caldwell's first goal with a ball that split the\ndefence. The second half began as tensely as the first,\nbut when Sean finished superbly after a surging run,\nthe game was won. With 10 minutes to go, their\ndefence somehow let Rob through, and for a minute\nwe thought he might score, but luckily he sliced it to\nPhil who in turn sliced it into the net for his second\nand the game's final goal.\nObviously, Willy-John's head injury was worse than\nwe thought, as we found him wandering aimlessly just\noutside the ground, so we poured a few drinks down\nhim when we got back, and funnily enough he didn't seem to mind.\nDivision 4\nP WDL FA Pts\nUC 4 14 12 2 0 76 26 26\nKings 5 15 8 4 3 42 29 20\nRFH 2 13 8 1 4 47 26 17\nIC 5 16 7 3 6 40 38 17\nGolds 3 16 7 1 8 46 47 15\nIC 4 16 7 1 8 40 45 15\nUC 5 15 5 1 8 34 42 1\n1\nLH 2 13 3 4 6 20 33 10\nMiddx/UCH 2 13 0 1 12 15 70 1\nDivision 5\nP wDL FA Pts\nKings 6 1\n1 7 1 3 43 17 15\nWest F971129815 KCH 2 12 6 3 3 30 23 15\nQMC 4 13 7 1 5 27 24 15\nUC 6 1\n1 5 1 5 35 22 1\n1\nQMC 5 12 4 2 6 22 32 10\nRSM 2 12 3 2 7 15 34 8\nNew 4 1\n4 2 1 1\n1 16 57 5\nIQ FE00000000 Division 6\nP WDL FA Pts\nLSE 5 16 9 3 2 72 35 21\nLSE 4 14 9 2 3 48 31 20\nUC 7 13 8 2 3 37 15 18\nMary's213823332618 IC 6 15 7 0 8 28 23 14\nBarts 2 9 5 0 4 35 41 10\nThomas 2 12 4 0 8 23 39 8\nKCH 3 14 2 4 8 18 47 8\nCHX 3 12 1 0 11 14 42 2\nWater Polo\n'Brilliant' and 'superb' are the only adjectives that\nsuitably describe the performance of the Ladies Water\nPolo team entered by IC Swimming & Water Polo Club\nin the National Universities Invitation Water Polo\nTournament held at Liverpool this weekend.\nDespite an unfavourable draw and having only\nplayed together as a team for a few weeks our ladies\novercame the challenge mounted by Manchester,\nSheffield, Lancaster, Wales and Bath to finish as\ntournament runners-up after a hard fought final\nagainst the impressive team fielded by Liverpool\nUniversity.\nCollege club members from St Mary's as well as the\nmain IC South Ken site formed the backbone of the\nteam entered under the name 'London Colleges' in\ndefiance to the players invited to play from other\nuniversities in Town. The squad was trained at IC by\nmembers of the Men's Water Polo Team at the ladies\nregular Wednesday evening sessions and coached at\nthe tournament by 'Big Bad' Dom (Faulkner).\nThe success of the ladies team is quite remarkable\nsince many of the players this weekend only took up\nthe sport when the squad came into existance at the\nbeginning of this term. And therefore the result is a clear reflection of the commitment and enthusiasm\nshown by all those who turn up regularly for training.\nSo congratulations to the team and thanks to the\nsquad's coaches.\nIt's our annual dinner this Wednesday at which the\nawards will be presented. Anyone who's a paid-up\nmember of the club should attend-7.30pm in\nSouthside Bar. Bring a guest.\nFencing\nLast weekend the U AU individual fencing\nchampionships were held at Bath University. Despite\nthe incredibly late organisation (entry forms were\nreceived 4 days before the competition) fencers from\nall over the country competed. IC, however, could\nonly muster 2 representatives; top sabre ur Jorg Pollok\n(who was taking a break from delivering babies in\nHastings) and club captain Dave Matthews, both\ncompeting in the sabre event.\nOur fencers made it through the first round with few\nproblems; there was then a long break while the ladies\nsabre was contested. (Liz Clark from St Mary's, who\nwon the event last year, was unfortunately\nunavailable to defend her title). In the second round\npools, Jorg easily made it through to the semi-finals\nwith 4 victories out of 5. Dave found himself in a very\ntough pool and struggled for promotion, eventually\njust making it on indicator points.\nUnfortunately for Jorg, the two perennial spectre s of sabre fencing-bad judging and bad presiding\u2014\nreared their ugly heads and to everyone's astonishment he was knocked out in the semi-finals\nwith one solitary victory. However, in a sublime\nmetamorphosis of his previous performance Dave\ncruised into the final, gaining four victories with a combination of blistering f lec he attacks and solid\nparry-riposte sequences.\nIn the final (a pool of 6) the pace increased again.\nDave ended up in 5th place with 2 victories, narrowly\nmissing another bout on sword points which would\nhave put him in the bronze medal position. He did,\nhowever, have the consolation of having beaten the\neventual winner (Nick Fletcher of Bristol) in the semifinal pool.\nPage 33\n\n"

The Harlington ground has been out of\naction for about three years and is still not suitable\nfor playing on.\nSherfield administration believes the profits should\ngo into a general fund. Sir Eric forwarded a suggestion\nthat the union should hold a referendum on the issue.\nThe Rector said that the 'common ground' was that\nthe profits should go towards student facilities.\n'Student housing is one of the great problems facing\nour students' he added.\nHe told Felix that the idea of a referendum was not\nunthinkable, at least once a year. When asked if the\nlack of interest in sabbatical elections might indicate\nthat even fewer students would take interest in a referendum, he responded by saying that perhaps\ngreater participation in college politics may stimulate\nmore interest in the sabbaticals. He said that a referendum must be on a simple 'yes-or-no' issue.\nThis meant, in his view, that the proposed careers\nservice cutbacks could not be put to students in the\nsame way. He said that he 'couldn't detect any\nenthusiasm on the issue (the referendum) in the\nGoverning body.'\nAt the moment, all decisions concerning the sports\nground must go through ICU. Both the Rector and\nProfessor Peter Richards, the Dean of St. Mary's, thought that this was too restrictive and should be\nchanged so that the Union is just consulted in the\ndecision making process. Eight members of the\nGoverning body voted for this amendment against the\nrest who abstained. Mr McCluskey is now looking\ninto the Union's legal position.\nPage 5\n\n"

Surprisingly, both the sweet\nand dry wines are made from the same grapes:\nSauvignon Blanc, Semillon and Muscadelle (not to be\nconfused with Muscat, Muscadet or Muscadel).\nBlending proportions do however vary considerably,\nthe rule of thumb being that in dry wines the\nSauvignon Blanc dominates whereas Semillon is the\nmajor constituent in the sweet wines.\nBordeaux' amazing sweet white wines are produced\nwhen a special mould called Botrytis attacks the\nSemillon grape shrivelling the grape and concentrating\nthe sugars and aromatic compounds in it. When the\ngrapes are harvested, crushed and fermented they\nproduce an intensely flavoured and sweet wine which\nis naturally high in alcohol.\nWe tasted three dry white wines from Andre Lurton,\nwho perhaps more than anyone else has been\nresponsible for the recently improved image and\nOn March 1 st a group of ten people flew out to France\nfor a visit to Ecole Centrale de Lyon (ECL). Imperial\nhas established a link with ECL so students can go\non an exchange in their third year. This year we have\nfive of their students studying here and one of our\nstudents, Neil Steer, at ECL. Neil is enjoying French\nlife and said that given the choice again he would most\ndefinitely go.\nECL is situated on a36 acre wooded site in Ecully,\na small suburb to the west of Lyon. With just 750\nundergraduates and 250 postgraduates the campus\nis ear i ly quiet for much of the time. The four halls of\nresidence show the greatest signs of life. Here the first\nand second years are accommodated; most third\nyears rent flats at a nearby apartment complex, which\nis considered inconvenient by the students owing to\nthe ten minute walk to the school-they'd have a shock at IC. The buildings are similar to Imperial \u2014\nanother architect with an obsession for rectangles has\nbeen at large.\nOne of the many attractions of studying in France\nhas to be the food. The university restaurant was a little disappointing with not much choice and\nunexciting stodgy food. However, the well organised\nstudents' union has had the price of the whole three\ncourse meal reduced to a flat fee of just one pound,\nwhich rather disgraces the prices at the MDH. The\nrestaurant is closed on alternate weekends; the union\nhas sprung into action once again and negotiated a15% discount at the local supermarket's excellent\nrestaurant. A large plate of smoked salmon cost me\njust 85p. Breakfast is taken in the kitchens on each\nfloor of the halls, and consists of bread and coffee.\nPage 34\nreputation of Bordeaux' dry whites. The standard of\nthe wines was consistently high, from his bargain\n\u00a32.39 easy drinking and attractive 1987 Ch. Bonnet\nto the impressive \u00a36.99 1987 Ch. La Louviere from\nthe Graves which had a lovely marriage of honeyed\noak flavours and leafy currant flavours.\nThe sweet wines, however, stole the show. At no\ncharge to the society Dave managed to bring along\ntwo different Premier Grand Cru Sauternes costing\nover \u00a320 each. Predictably, perhaps, the favourite\nsweet wine and also the most expensive. Ch.\nRieussec is a neighbour of the legendary Ch. D 'Yquem\nand the 1982 which we tasted had a deep\ngolden/orange colour and an intensely sweet but\nbalanced flavour with a long finish tasting slightly of\nmarmalade. Most people felt that the 1984 Cypres de\nClimens offered the best value for money. The\nexcellent Ch. Climens, which we also tasted, didn't release their classed grown wine in '84 and produced\nonly under their 2nd label: Cypres de Climens at\nconsiderable financial loss. For \u00a35.99 a bottle this\ngolden coloured and intensely musty and syrupy wine\nwas worth more than every penny it cost. Rumour has\nit that Sainsbury are selling it, under their own label\nhalf-bottles, for the same price!\nBy the time you read this I hope you will have\nenjoyed this term's last tasting of Alsace wines. Don't miss the couple of events we're planning for next\nterm: an enlightening tasting of Austrian wines and,\npossibly, a trip to an English vineyard.\nHappy Easter!\nThe French education system is quite different to\nours. To get to ECL, France's best engineering school\noutside Paris, a student would have to do well in the\nFrench equivalent of 'A' Levels, the Bacalaureate, and\nthen progress to the Classes Preparatoires where\nmaths and physics are studied intensively for two\nyears. The only real problem facing exchange students\nis surprisingly not the French, but the maths. Not only\ndo the French know a lot more but they have also been\ntaught to think about maths in a more theoretical way.\nCareful selection of courses helps to ease this\nproblem. The exchange is not just for super students,\nit is open to any engineer who can obtain a2/1 at the\nend of part II and speaks reasonably fluent French.\nWe were hosted by the French students\nthemselves, to give us a real taste of life at ECL. Our\nitinerary was most impressive, we met their Director\nof Studies, toured the labs, attended a lecture, saw\na student production of Sartre's Huis Clos, listened\nto a rock concert on campus, ate crepes, dined in a Lyon restaurant and toured Lyon twice in just three\ndays. We all wished we could stay on longer on\nSunday night as we were driven back to the airport.\nThe students have very formal relationships with the\nteaching staff, but amongst themselves there is a great camaraderie, with only 750 student everyone\nseems to know everyone else.\nTwo hours is the time of the best and worse\nfeatures of ECL. The lectures last a heavy two hours,\nbut the Alps are just two hours away. Besides 1992\nand all that, I would like to study there for it would\nbe a refreshing contrast after two years of inner city\nImperial.\nEnviro\nSoc\nOn Thursday March 22 at 12.45pm in Mech Eng 542,\nthe Environmental Society (ICU EATS) will be holding\na lecture entitled 'Transport in the 3rd World'. Given\nby Alan Smith of Intermediate Technology Transport,\nthe lecture will concentrate on local, appropriate\ntechnology that can be applied to transport in the\ndeveloping countries, designing specific transport\nsolutions for them rather than giving them yesterday's designs from the West.\nFollowing this lecture at 1.45pm, the Society will\nbe holding it's Annual General Meeting to elect a new\ncommittee for next year. Envirosoc is a high profile,\npolitically neutral society orientated around lectures\nand campaigns. This is your chance to get involved\nnot only in the running, but also hopefully influence\nthe way the Environment and Appropriate Technology\nare seen and presented around College. There are\nmany posts available ranging from publicity through\nto information collation, lecture organisation and\ncampaigning. More information will be given at the\nmeeting.\nRock gig\nIf you missed this, be sorry. Even the support band,\nthe Green Meanies, although they hadn't bothered to\ndress up, played a really enjoyable frantic, noisy set\nreminiscent of much of the heavy metal of the late\n70s and early 80s. The Meanies can't sing, but they\nplayed well in a style that allows shouted lyrics to\nsound alright. They were called upon to give a couple\nof encores, which seemed to surprise them. We were\nonly the third audience ever to hear them live.\nA couple of records were played, and then E.T.A. began in a blaze of guitar-lashing, which they\ncommenced before walking onto the stage. Recently\nthey have been supporting major acts in larger venues,\nand some of those who had already seen them\ncheered expectantly. Their tight jeans, studded belts\nand fancy shirts suggested either Glam Rock or Power\nMetal. They would have to be good not to seem like\nan anti-climax after the Meanies. Not only were they\ngood; they were great. They began with some original\nPower material and soon shifted into a Glam/Power\nblend that pleased almost everyone. Even their few\ncovers were played with enough skill and flare to be\nimprovements on the originals, although not a patch\non the bands own songs. The vocals were good,\nalthough the vocalist had the embarrassing bab it of\ntouching his dick and cheering louder than the\naudience. The instrumentation was excellent. If you\nlike Thin Lizzy, Guns 'n' Roses, Judas Priest, Iron\nMaiden and Faster Pussycat, watch out for E.T.A. in\nfuture.\nThe evening's entertainment finished with a disco\nand everyone had a really good time; it was a shame\nonly about 100 people turned up. It would have been\nnice to see more unfamiliar faces, to be part of a bigger crowd. This was the best evening's entertainment I can clearly remember, if the next\nRockSoc event is only one tenth as good, you'd have\nto be a dick head not to come.\nJason Pike.\nFrench Exchange\n\n"

    "content": "The Knight of Cheapskate\nThe Baron was so happy. After all these years of\nbumbling buffoonery he had been made a knight of\nthe OBN. After years of being snubbed by his friends\non the Committee of Very Clever People he'had made\nthe big time. He could hear the words now, 'Arise Sir\nDerek, Knight of Cheapskate.'\nHis eyes misted over as he remembered the night\nof the announcement. Drunk with joy, he had cycled\nhome to Cheapskate, only for some fool to knock him\nflying. Didn't the law of Gravity KNOW he was a Knight. So it was that Derek Dash, not-quite-so-noble-as-he-would-have-really-liked Knight of the OBN,\nfound himself on crutches. All he was was a simple\nKnight-Bachelor, sag gy and a bit loose at the seams,\nbut Mad Dash loved him, now she was a'rea ul gen u whine Inglish Laydey.'\nThings were going well. Now that John Secretary\nhad left there was no one to stand in his way. With\nhis friends in the Manic Planning Group he had the\npower, he had the authority, he had the ego, he could\ndo what he wanted. With House of Fraser by his side,\nthe citizens were powerless. That Neil McCrafty was\njust a pawn. All he needed to do was sidestep\nMcCrafty and deal with Dai Incompetent, the deputy\npawn. The question now stood, with a pawn and a knight, who was the queen?\nWelcome OldRidge was sitting in his office,\nplanning the new rents for the citizens. 'If I subtract\nthree apples from six bananas and custard, in the\nExpensive Hall meals budget, I should only have to\ncharge four pears and a pomegranate per week,' he\nthought. 'How fruity!'\nThe citizens were outraged: 'Four Pears and a pomegranate! 'shrieked Neil McCrafty. 'I want the\ncitizens' opinion on this one. We must let everyone\nknow. After years of outrageously citrus rent\nincreases, we should call for a freezing of rents. I shall\nwrite a rude letter to the Knight and call for frozen\nfruits. Sir Derek can sling his hook, there are plenty\nmore fish in the sea after all.'\nDerek just laughed. 'Their calls will fall upon deaf\nears,' he said. 'I have had enough of fruitful\ndiscussions. I shall fight them on the beaches, I shall\nfight them on the shingle pits, I shall...' he mumbled\non, realising that his political ambitions were all for\nnaught. 'Shingle pits,' he thought, 'what a fine idea.\nMad Dash has wanted a new lighting system for the\ndownstairs toilet in 710 for some time. This could be\nthe chance for a profitable bit of negotiating. I shall\ntell McCrafty that citizens will be allowed to use the\ntoilet as a facility on Fridays during April in a leap year.\nHe'll realise that the money from the shingle pits\nshould pay for it. I 'll tell him it's for a new set of\ncitizens' living quarters.'\nThe Shingle Pits, now there was an issue (bless\nyou). Alas! All was not well. Hooker Club were\ndefiant. 'We refuse to play on a cabbage patch,'\nscreamed Benj Trainers. 'The College has enough\nvegetables already. If anyone suggests a fruit patch\nas well, I shall scream.'\n'Your Astroturd is far too expensive,' House of\nFraser replied. 'You can make do with an orange peel\nfoundation. I want value for money. I'm not seeing\nyou wasting good Cheapskate money on an Astroturd\npitch based on Pineapples when there are plenty of\ngood oranges left over from last year.'\nMeanwhile, in the Phallix Office, Adrain 'Fruity'\nHeathen was sobbing. 'I'm sick of these allusions to\nfruit,' he cried.\nill m'I agree,' said Smuggly, turning from lighting the last\nblack candle in his office. 'Fruit has figured far too\nmuch in Phallix recently. Here, have an apple and\nconsole yourself.' Smuggly looked up from his\npentagram, wiped the blood from his hands and\nmoaned 'that's the last time I print Guiltsheet.'\nSuddenly (as if by magic), the telephone rang (and\na shopkeeper appeared). It was Mike Gravestone,\nmanager of the Citizens Comic Shop. 'Strewth,' said\nthe man in a very Kiwi fruit styled voice as he\ndisappeared almost as quickly has he had appeared.\n'Look's like the pentagram's still working,' said\nSmuggly, as he traced a train shaped sigil upon the\nfloor of the Phallix Office.\n'Where am I, what am I,' groaned the apparition as\nit solidified. The image became as clear as day and\ncontinued to solidify. It was Wing Commander\nTrainspotter and he was not c huffed. Suddenly steam\nstarted to pour from all of the Wing Commander's orifices,' This time, Smuggly,' he screamed, 'you've\ngone too far. With these fruity comments and your\nPricocon misprints, you've gone totally off the rails.\nI 've had enough, I'm off to Clapham Junction for a quiet bit of shunting,' he complained. Smuggly smiled\nand traced the number 462 on the floor as the Wing\nCommander started to fade.\nMeanwhile, in the Dirtdiggers' office, Rob Paddle,\nthe chief Dirtdigger, was voting for the new head\nDirtdiggers. 'Biroknee Moses she's a girly. We can't have that.' Biroknee, the Dirtdiggers' Pornsheet editor\nknew that she had little or no chance in the Very\nSecret Ballot, held by the Dirtdiggers. The Dirtdigger\nelections were never fair. The problem was that none\nof the Dirtdiggers could count. Every year, they were\nforced to make the numbers up. Smuggly was sure\nthat he was not going to use Rob Paddle for anything\nintellectual, when he slaved for a day. The\nRocktappers didn't care anyway.\nDai Incompetent was sitting in his office, playing\nwith his balls. He had made so many balls ups recently,\nhe had started a collection. 'All I wanted was a quiet\nlife,' he moaned. 'Just me and my gal and a barrel of\nBrakespears. If things don't improve I shall be forced\nto start drinking all day with Ugg Hagan.'\n'Stop complaining,' said Fiona Knickerless, as she\nwandered in with Jacob Marley. 'You're working this\nweekend. I'm off for some more events with Jacob,\nbye!'\nAs the chief citizens moaned and mumbled Smuggly\nplotted. 'The end of the world is nigh,' he screamed\nwith a manic grin on his face, as he turned to his four\nfriends from the riding club. 'Get those black rags\nsmartened up, it's time for a party. 'Famine, get in the\nHack Bar and start on those portion sizes, they're far\ntoo big. Pestilence, Professor Anderson wants a word,\nand War, you can stay down here for now.' Death\ngrinned, he was good at it.\n'The end of the world?' said Jason Cynic, looking\nup from his cup of coffee,' that's the first good news\nI 've heard all day.'\n'News?' shrieked the Fairystories Editor, Adam\nHassling'em. 'Oh my ears and whiskers, where?'\nPage 23\n\n"

    "content": "Tax poll Afroc to sue DP?\nAfter a lot of in-depth research, the results of the 'Poll\nTax Poll' (Felix 855, 19 January) can be published.\nFor all of you who were too lazy to send in the\ninformation requested, you will have to persuade your\nlandlords yourself.\nAll landlords were asked the question 'Will you be\nreducing the rents for your residents in April when\nrates are replaced by the poll tax? ' This was often\nfollowed by 'Why not?'\nFor student halls of residence belonging to Imperial\nCollege or Intercollegiate halls belonging to the\nUniversity of London there will be no reduction as\nno rates are payed anyway.\n'More House' on Cromwell road said that rents\nwould have to be raised in any case, so no reduction.\nMr Christian of 'Dachstock A.G.' said that rents\nwould go down, as did Mrs Kozlowski of\nCricklewood, and Mr Jimmy Joury of Hammersmith.\nMr Mohammed Bashir of Hounslow was\nconsistently unavailable for comment. Nearly all the\nlandlords said that rents would go up in the near future\ndue to increases in general expenditure.\nStrike!\nThe IC branch of the Manufacturing, Science and\nFinance trade union (MSF) have held a strike ballot\nin which 176 members supported the proposal to strike\nand 63 opposed it. 76% of the members at IC voted.\nThe issue is over the college's intention to make\ncompulsory redundancies in the Biochemistry\ndepartment. A delegation including members of the\nMSF and representatives from other Universities\npicketed the meeting of the Governing Body of the\ncollege this Friday, and were invited in to talk over\nthe matter. The Governing Body was then left to\ndiscuss it amongst themselves. The results of the\ndeliberations are not yet known.\nThe MSF's case is that, in the words of Mr Harry\nFairbrother, president of the MSF, 'the governing\nbody could offer a solution to the problem by\naccepting no compulsory redundancies and offering\na retraining programme'. He said that 'the money\ninvolved is trivial these are skilled people whose\njobs have disappeared. It seems obvious to retrain.'\nHe added 'We've had many strikes - we know what\nto do. They are very painful for all concerned and\nare more destructive than constructive. The ballot says\nthat we are prepared to take the sharpest possible\naction.'\nHay fever\nHay fever sufferers are in demand from the Centre\nof Environmental Technology. They are studying the\nsymptoms of the allergy over the summer and need\nstudents who will be living in London over the\nsummer vacation to act as subjects.\nThere is no problem if you are taking medication\nfor the condition . All interested parties should contact\nGeoff Gunner at the Centre for Environmental\nTechnology, 48 Princes Gardens.\nPage 4\nAfro-caribbean (Afroc) society chairman, Dave\nCornwall, has threatened to sue ICU Deputy\nPresident, Dave Williams for negligence, breach of\ncontract and libel over a party planned for last night.\nMr Cornwall told FELIX that Afroc's Jazz Festival\nhad been cancelled at short notice after a decision by\nthe College's Bar Committee to ban their events on\nlicensed premises.\nThe cancellation has cost IC Union an estimated\n\u00a31200 to pay for bands booked and publicity\nproduced. Mr Cornwall said that Dave Williams had\nknown about the College Bar Committee decision for\na month and had not informed him until 10 days\nbefore the event. He was unable to cancel the bands\nat such short notice and has now asked for written\nconfirmation that the Union will pay for any costs\nincurred. The Union is now looking into insurance\nfor cancelling room bookings.\nMr Williams told FELIX that he had not thought\nthe college bar committee had decided to ban future\nAfroc events on licensed premises. He was later\ninformed by the Union Manager and Bar Manager,\nwho were present at the meeting, that a ban had been\nagreed.\nUnion Honorary Secretary, Fiona Nicholas, told\nFELIX that she had checked with Mr Williams before\nconfirming the room booking for the event on 21st February, a week after the meeting which banned\nAfroc events in licensed areas. The event was also\nconfirmed at an executive committee meeting, which\nagreed to overrule a ban imposed by the Union's House committee.\nThe college bar committee's decision to ban Afroc\nevents has been condemned as 'racist' by Mr Cornwall, who told FELIX that the ban was made\non the basis of 'selective evidence,' without allowing\nthe society to present its case. He suggested that\nproblems at an Afroc event earlier this year were\ncaused by an 'unfortunate co-incidence,' of the crowd\nthat was attracted. He now intends to take the matter\nto the Race Relations Board and the Citizens Advice\nBureau, whilst contacting 'The Voice,' a national\nblack magazine.\nMr Williams has now taken professional advice on\nMr Cornwall's potential legal action.\nMAKE A Flying START TO THE NINETIES from\no/w rt n PARIS \u00a340 \u00a365\nBERLIN \u00a360 \u00a389\nMADRID \u00a365 \u00a3108\nNEW YORK \u00a3106 \u00a3198\nLOS ANGELES \u00a3150 \u00a3300\nTEL AVIV \u00a389 \u00a3149\nHONG KONG \u00a3264 \u00a3528\nSINGAPORE \u00a3240 \u00a3480\nSKI - ONE WEEK from only \u00a379\nWEEKEND BREAKS from \u00a365\nDon't MISS OUT THIS SUMMERSeats TO ASIA AND AUSTRALASIA SELLING FAST\nBook NOW TO SECURE YOUR SEAT\nULU TRAVEL\nS HER FIELD BUILDING\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ULU TRAVEL\n\n"

    "content": "Fantastic... Murphy's law\nSir,\nThe Policy and Resources Committee of St Mary's has recommended to the Delegacy (the body which\nhas delegated authority from the Governing Body of\nImperial to run St Mary's) that part of the proceeds\nof the sale of a tennis court area on the St Mary's ground at Teddington, should be used to help build\nor buy a new IC Hall of Residence under the umbrella\nof the St Mary's/ Imperial Appeal and that the balance\nshould be used to rebuild the stand for spectators and\nto improve the facilities at the Teddington Sports\nGround. The sale was arranged before the merger.\nThe condition under which we personally would\nsupport the proposal would be that IC matches the\ncontribution appropriately. We have reason to believe\nthat if the College in this way raised, for example,\n\u00a31M from its resources, a charitable trust might\ndouble our money, in the same way that it did for the\nrenovation of Wilson House a few years ago. We\nbelieve that this would be a fantastic deal for the\nstudents of Imperial, including St Mary's. Yours sincerely,\nProfessor Peter Richards, Pro Rector (Medicine) and\nDean of St Mary's H.M.S. Mr Rhydian Hapgood, President, Students Union.\nDear Dave,\nI am writing to provide some factual information on\nthe letting of the College Flats in the basements of\nFisher Hall. This is in order to correct the inaccuracies\nand assumptions confined in a letter in last week's FELIX (issue 864, Friday March 9). In particular, I am\nconcerned that the statements made by your\ncorrespondent could discourage many students from\napplying for places in these flats.\nThe Fisher Hall flats are a part of the so-called\nCollege Flats which are available for renting by groups\nof IC students. The arrangements for the letting s are\nmade through the Accommodation Office in Prince's Gardens. The availability of the flats and details of\nhow to apply are advertised by the Accommodation\nOffice and are displayed on posters throughout\nCollege at the appropriate time. The tenants for\nCollege Flats are chosen by the Wardens of the Halls\nin questions in conjunction with the Accommodation\nOffice.\nThe Fisher Hall flats have now been available for\ntwo years. In their first year one flat had to be let as\nrooms due to a shortage of applicants. About 50%\nof the current population of the Fisher Hall flats are\nex-residents, in contrast with the statement by your\ncorrespondent that 'all the students in the flats,\nalmost without exception are indeed ex-Fisher Hall\nresidents'. This proportion reflects the number of\napplications made by Fisher Hall residents, which last\nyear was about half of the total received (there were\nabout twice as many applications as flats). An\nincrease in the total number of applications for the\nflats is anticipated this year.\nApplications for the flats are welcomed from any\ngroups of students who are eligible to apply. Neither\npositive nor negative discrimination has been or will\nbe shown towards Fisher Hall residents. As a further\npoint of information it should be noted that the Evelyn\nGardens Superintendent and the Fisher Hall Reapplicants or Sub-wardens are not responsible for the\nchoice of tenants for these flats.\nIt is very unfortunate that, without bothering to\nascertain the facts, your correspondent chose to\nexpress his or her views in public. Both myself and\nthe Accommodation Office hope that the information\npresented here will prevent students being misled by\nlast week's letter. The Accommodation Office will be\npleased to provide further information on these flats\nor any matter relating to College accommodation for\nstudents.\nYours sincerely,\nDr RJ Murphy, Warden, Fisher Hall.\nChild's play\u2014just not cricket\nDear Dave,\nOur children attend the IC day nursery, and although\nwe are very happy about the warm and caring\natmosphere there, we are extremely worried about the\npremises:\n\u2022\na. the children have very limited access to the\ngardens.\nb. the children and staff in the basement rooms\nhave limited natural light\nc. good hygiene is difficult to implement\nd. building maintenance is poor\nWe take the above points in detail again:\nAccess to the garden is restricted to twice a day\n(from 10.00 to 11.30 and from 13.00 to 15.15) and\nthese times are inconvenient to the children's schedules. They have their lunch at 11.30, and then\nthey take a nap until 15.00. This situation restricts\nour children's use of the garden. Because of the stairs\nleading to the garden, the effort involved in putting\non the children's clothes, and leading them up the\nstairs safely, they have at most 45 minutes per day\nuse of the garden, and this when British weather\npermits. The result is that most children, whose\nparents work full time, spend all of their time indoors\nwithout the benefit of fresh air, sun, and a place to\nexercise and run about.\nThe basement rooms cause us great concern. The\nnursery nurses and children in the basement depend\non artificial light throughout the daylight hours. Very\nlittle natural light can reach these rooms, so little in\nfact, to be almost non-existent. We are concerned\nPage 30\nthat neon/fluorescent light can be damaging to the\neyes, especially if it is the only light source available.\nAlso children as well as adults need several hours'\nexposure to natural light for health as well\npsychological reasons.\nWe know of no other employees at Imperial College\nwho work under such appalling lighting conditions.\nAlso, we feel guilty and unhappy that our children and\nthe nursery nurses are obliged to play and work under\nsuch poor conditions, that we, ourselves would refuse\nif offered to us as working conditions.\nThe premises are run down. The basement needs\na damp course, paint is peeling off the walls, and the\nrugs are dirty. As a result, children and nursery nurses\nare put in a health threatening situation. The kitchen\nis used as a sleeping area after lunch and the nursery\nnurses have to rush to clean the place and make the\nbeds for the children. The floor is damp from mopping,\nand the toddlers have to walk barefoot on this floor\nto reach their beds. There is only one window to a light\nshaft which provides poor ventilation for the twenty\nsleeping children. They do not have a suitable place\nfor rest when they are very tired or ill. Also, the\nnursery nurses do not have a proper staff room for\nthemselves, and thus they can never take a proper\nrest during their break periods.\nWe are very happy with and grateful to the nursery\nnurses, for their commitment and kindness to our\nchildren. They are responsive to our children's needs\nand our worries, despite the burden of disgusting\nworking conditions. We support the nursery nurses\nand want to do all we can to improve the conditions\nwhere they work. They provide a high standard of\ncare; it is a shame that the premises do not reflect\nthis. We feel that the nursery nurses labour under\nconditions worthy of a Victorian sweatshop. There is\na high turnover in nursery nurses at the Nursery,\nespecially those in the basement rooms, which is\ndetrimental to the children's welfare. In addition, this\ncauses a higher administrative burden to Mrs Thornett\nwhose time would be better spent caring for the\nchildren in here charge. Lastly, the high staff turnover\nincreases the costs of running the nursery, which in\nturn, causes the rise in Nursery fees.\nIn conclusion, we realise that things do not change\novernight; but we are worried over our children's and\nthe nursery nurses' welfare. We need to know what\nsteps the College will take to improve this desperate\nsituation. We believe the best remedy would be new\npremises and unrestricted garden access. We will\nsupport the Imperial College Day Nursery nurses and\nthe Nursery Committee in their efforts to obtain these\ngoals.\nYours sincerely,\nAndrew Curley (student, Flee Eng), Simon Essery\n(student, Life Sci), Ali Dariani (student, Elec Eng),\nlli yau s Maisanda (student, Min Res Eng), Margaret\nCunningham (Senior Lecturer, Senior Tutor,\nComputing), Sophia Drossopoulou (Lecturer,\nComputing), Susan Eisenbach (Lecturer, Computing),\nEllen Haigh (Librarian, Computing and Elec Eng), Kim\nHarrison (Admin Officer, Computing), Peter Harrison\n(Reader, Computing), Steve Vickers (Lecturer,\nComputing).\n\n"

    "content": "Black Rain\nFilm\nNo, this is not a re-run of the highly successful Black\nRain starring Micheal Douglas.\nShohei Imamure is renowned for good quality films\nwith an eye to realism and documentaries. His latest\nfilm Black Rain is a drama chronicling the life of a family who walk through Hiroshima just after the first\natom bomb has been dropped on the city. At the time\nthey are unaware of the dangers or even the existence\nof high radioactivity.\nThe story soon slips on to 1950. Yasuko, the young\ngirl, has not yet found a husband because as soon as\nany suitor hears that she was in Hiroshima soon after\nthe bomb was detonated they don't want to marry\nher-health is important in a wife. Even in post-war\nJapan the arrangement of a marriage was a very\nformal affair and to have failed to find a husband by\nthe time you were 25 was a shame. Her uncle and\naunt, with whom she lives, try to do their best for her\nbut to no avail.\nMany people in the village where they live have\nbeen affected by the bomb and the war. Yasuko's uncle sees many of his friends die from radiation\nsickness-he too has many symptoms but they do not\nprogress very quickly.\nThe film is shot in black and white with the original\nsoundtrack and English subtitles. That is really my only\ncomplaint about the film-l don't like subtitles\nbecause you can't watch the film properly when you\nhave to keep on reading the subtitles. The black and\nwhite adds to the starkness of some of the scenes\nin Hiroshima and also to the period feel of the film.\nI'm glad it was in black and white as I don't think I could have stomached some of the scenes in colour-people, their bodies burnt all over walking around\ncrying in pain, just waiting to die; charred corpses in\nvarious attitudes of tortured death; bodies lying or\nsitting on the ground twitching slightly; stiff corpses\nfloating down the river, bumping over stones on the\nbeds of streams; people trapped under rubble\nclutching out at passers by imploring their help. And\nthen you think people actually had to endure all this,\nand worse, and in full colour, and 3-D as well.\nA marvellous attention to detail characterises this\nfilm-a dog frolics just before the blast, a clock blasted\nout of a train is found in the river later when Yasuko\nand her aunt ferry across to Hiroshima. This detail is\neven, perhaps more so, shown in the scenes of horror\nin the city. A woman nurses her charred baby, a man\nleans out of a window and shouts, 'Hiroshima! Where\nis Hiroshima?', a man does not recognise his brother\nwho runs up to him because he is badly burned all over\nand insists on proof of his identity.\nSome Confusion in the\nLaw About Love\nThis is the seventh bizarre production from the small\nSheffield based touring company, Forced\nEntertainment. For six years this cooperative has been\nbreaking new ground with its exciting productions and\ntheir latest is no exception.\n'A whole load of confusion about the plot', might\nhave been a more apt title, for the work is contorted.\nThe playwright has tried to expose the way we relate\nto the world, think and generally function. Our lives\nare complex, our minds are disorganised so how can\na true representation be compartment ali sed into\nconventional scenes and acts? The play leaves\nconformity behind to explore the subject unhindered.\nThus there is little in the way of plot to describe.\nThe play is a result of much 'three in the morning\nNescafe philosophy' beloved of students. To convey\nthese rambling abstract concepts in just two hours\ncalls for unusual devices. Fragments of sex acts, love\nsuicides and tales of Presley coming back from the\ngrave. To ease the ideas along, the play is amply\ntopped up with humour, which relies on superb dead\npan delivery of the lines. The actors' performances are\nas polished as is the whole play. In our age where\nliterary theatre has a stranglehold on respectability\nand power, it is good to see some confusion breaking\nthrough.\nPlease note that half way through the play the three\nmain characters take most of their clothes off and the\nwomen put on false breasts and the man a false penis.\nThis is a necessary part of the play although it may\nTheatre\ncause offense to some people.\nThe average ICA goer has a propensity to wear\nmagenta lipstick, wear magenta clothes and be called\nMagenta, this quirk in ess lends the place an\natmosphere which enhances enjoyment of the play.\nThis very alternative production is certainly not for the\nproverbial maiden aunt, but should please most open-minded people.\nCharles Tomkins.\nAs Yasuko and her uncle and aunt travel across the\ncity they meet a man who tells them of how he found\nhis son trapped under rubble and tried to free him.\nFinding he couldn't however, and with the fires\nbeginning to spread, he ran away and left him despite\nhis son's pleas. Yasuko and her family are disgusted,\nbut how many would have done the same?\nThe film also explores the agonies of why the\nAmericans dropped the atom bombs when they were\nwinning-one of the men felt he couldn't die until he\nknew.\nBlack Rain gives a powerful insight into the lives of\nlong surviving victims of the Bomb. It chronicles with\nstark realism the horrors and agonies of the memory\nand how they cope with trying to go back to a normal\nlife afterwards. Unlike so many films and plays the\nending is as strong as the rest and makes a great\nimpact on the viewer.\nJLW\nFilm\nRoger and Me\nMichael Moore grew up in Fiint, Michigan, birthplace\nof Gigacorporation General Motors, at a time when\nAmerica was still the most powerful trading nation on\nEarth. All of his relations worked in one or other of\nthe gain t GM plants that dominated the local\neconomy. Times were good for the well paid workers.\nMoore did not, however, find the thought of a life\nspent on an assembly line appealing, so he left for San\nFrancisco to be a magazine editor.\nHe was moved to return to his home town by the\nnews of plant closures and huge job losses, as well\nas the fact that he was sacked from his magazine job.\nThe film he made there is about a town that has no\nreason to exist anymore. Shops closed down, crime\nsoared, and attempts at replacing industry with\ntourism failed miserably. Money magazine voted Flint\nthe least loved city in the whole country.\nMoore tries repeatedly to get an interview with\nRoger Smith, chairman of GM and the person Moore\nfeels is responsible for this misery.\nHe also takes a camera to numerous interviews with\nthe people of Flint to get their reactions. This forms\nthe body of the film, and very strange people they are\ntoo. The situations and characters could have come\nfrom David Byrne's True Stories, but they are for real.\nMost of the events shown in the film are tragic, but\nit is also very funny in places.\nRoger and Me is not a run of the mill American film,\nbut definately worth a look if you can find it.\nJim Loaf.\nPage 9\n\n"

    "content": "Student reply Union reply Mole\nDear Dave,\nI was saddened to see more attacks on the Union\npermanent staff in recent issues. Far from receiving\na 'miserable grudging reception', I have always found\nMichelle, her predecessor Kathy, and Jen polite and\nhelpful in my dealings with them over the last six\nyears.\nUnfortunately, there are far too many people at IC\nwho seem to think they deserve better treatment than\neveryone else, from the snotty fascist fresher who\ncouldn't be bothered to get a Union Card when\neveryone else did, yet has a 'right' to demand one\ninstantly when he sees fit, through to the guy who\ncouldn't fill a van with petrol as he was 'too ill',\ndespite being able to drive back from Wales on his\nown.\nGiven the large number of such people that they\nhave to deal with, I am surprised the Permanent Staff\nmanage to stick it at all. In fact, the few occasions\nwhen I have seen any of them lose their temper is\nwhen trying to deal with the above kind of person,\nwho apparently thinks treating people like servants is\nthe way to get the best service. Well, it isn't, and\nhopefully people like this will soon learn that those\nwho go looking for confrontation usually find it,\nwhereas if you're pleasant to someone, even if you\nthink they're in the wrong, you usually get a better\nresponse.\nIn this light, I fail to see how vitriolic attacks on the\nPermanent Staff can do anything but aggravate the\nproblem you claim to be having with them, so how\nabout being a bit more positive? It can't do any harm,\nand you could even get to like it.\nYours,\nDave Wilson, Comp PG.\nQuite frankly..\nDear Dave,\nI have heard Liz Warren's explanation of how the\nUnion office staff reacted to the large amount of\nfranking done. Further, I have heard directly how the\noffice staff reacted to Liz's letter, and both sides feel\nthat there are principles at stake.\nSadly, there are, and more. Anyone who has\nworked with the Union in any of its aspects will have\nseen how many people work harder and longer than\nthey should to get the job done-permanent staff,\nsabbaticals, Union officers, people who design and\ndistribute publicity, van drivers, Rag collectors and so\non and so forth.\nThe Union cannot possibly afford to pay for all the\nmanpower it uses-it lurches along, as it must, on a knife-edge of goodwill and co-operation, and neither\nof these qualities can be written into a job description.\nWhen this precarious system breaks down, as it has\nhere, no purpose is served by chasing principles. By\nthe time they are caught, all the goodwill is lost and\nthe Union cannot run without it. As a sincere request\nto all those who might be caught in such a situation,\nplease don't precipitate crises just for the sake of\nfeeling right.\nTom Yates, Space Physics PG\n(ICU Council Chairman)\nPage 28\nDear Dave,\nIn reply to comments made about Union staff in\nrecent editions of FELIX, I have the following to say:\nIn printing what you have done in FELIX, I can only\nclass you as totally irresponsible.\n1. In printing speculative allegations, then what you\nhave done could well be libel. As far as I am concerned\nnone of the Union staff have deliberately tampered\nwith election procedure and on behalf of the Union\nstaff I request a full retraction.\n2. In being a sabbatical elected by students you\nhave a responsibility to those students whilst\nmaintaining your Editorial freedom. By writing what\nyou did you created a disharmony amongst the staff\nruining the relations that have existed between FELIX\nand the Union and within the Union so far this year.\nThis in turn, without a lot of work on my behalf, is\npotentially detrimental to the students. The allegations\nyou made were very serious and should have been\ninvestigated before printing, not afterwards. Surely\nit is detrimental to the Union as a whole for its staff\nto be put on trial through its media!\n3. In respect of criticisms of individual staff and their\nwork ethics then surely it is better to lay those\ncriticisms before the people that can do something\nabout them rather than inform 5,000 students of one\nperson's opinion without even trying to get two sides\nof the story.\nI normally try to avoid the use of clich es but the\nfollowing seem very appropriate:\n'Don't wash your dirty washing in public'\n'Don't bite the hand that feeds you.'\nAnd on behalf of the students; think before you print\nbecause it's us you answer to.\nNeil McCluskey,\nP.S. Sorry to disappoint the readers but this is not\nthe start of an age long battle between the FELIX\nEditor and the Union President since at the time of\nwriting all the staff and sabbaticals have sat down and\ndiscussed openly and maturely the matters at hand.\nRecommendations will arise from further meetings to\npromote the future good relations that David Smedley\nand I have enjoyed this year.\nReally Callous\nDear Sir,\nI am writing in response to last week's letter entitled\n'The Callous Conservatives Again', where N Royall\nrecounts the incident he/she saw in Kensington High\nStreet.\nSurely he is not suggesting that it's best for\nambulance men to strike and collect money on our\nstreets, just in case someone falls ill. I totally adhere\nto ConSoc's poster 'Support the ambulance men, let\nthe patients die', because patients are dying everyday\ndue to the ambulance men withdrawing their labour.\nYou never see the nurses behaving so irresponsibly.\nI therefore think instead of 'Callous Conservatives',\nthe article should have read 'Callous Ambulancemen'.\nI also have my own message for these people 'put\naway your begging bowls and get back to work!'.\nYours,\nA Bailey, Chem,\nDear Dave,\nI think you ought to know: you have a mole in your\noffice who is selling your column 'Science This Week'\nto New Scientist nearly a week before it is published\nin FELIX. New Scientist are then following up your\nscoops and extending them into serious articles. The\ncheats! What a way to fill their spare column inches!\nI trust you will sue...\nYours litigious ly, Adrian Redgers, PG Neural Systems, Elec Eng.\nOffensive\ntwaddle\nDear Dave,\nI must take up cudgels with you and Mr Shanley for\nhis disgusting del at or column. Miss Jackie Welfare is\nabsolutely right, a distinct feeling of nausea comes\nover me when I read Mr Shanley's twaddle and\nfrequently I am forced to flee the room and inhale\nsome fresh wholesome Exhibition Road air.\nEspecially offensive to me as a modern mother was\nhis attempt to persuade young, impressionable\nstudents into fare evasion on the District Line.\nMy son Sydney was fined \u00a3400 by LRT and branded\nfor life with a criminal record. When he was caught\nhe cried. What would his friends say? His sales\nmanager wasn't too pleased either...\nPlease take it upon yourself to protect IC students\nfrom people like Mr Shanley. Journalistic freedom is\none thing but anarchic pro pog and a is quite a different\nball game.\nDr Edna Broadbent, Biotech.\n\n"

    "content": "The Vanek Plays\nTheatre\nVaclav Havel, the first democratic president of\nCzechoslovakia in fifty years, is rapidly becoming a true international statesman. Yet after an\nannouncement last week, which said he was not to\npatron is e the European stage company's latest\nproduction of his three one-act plays during a forthcoming visit to Britain, he seems to be playing\ndown his position as an international dramatist.\nThe Vanek plays as such were originally written by\nand for a group of Havel's friends in the mid-1970s; a time when such political theatre was banned in their\nnative Czechoslovakia. The three that Havel wrote\nhimself: Audience, Protest and Private View share a common character, Ferdinand Vanek, with those\npenned by his friends are currently being performed\nin pairs at the Lyric Studios, Hammersmith.\nVanek's inscrutable docility and politeness to his\nfriends and colleagues frustrates them and pushes\nthem into ex has pe rated moral self-justifications. In\nAudience, the head malt ster in a brewery becomes\nincreasingly fearful of factory floor worker Vanek's cordial silence which he misconceives to be 'a playwright's moral superiority'. In between frequent\nglasses of beer and trips to the loo, this darkly comic\nportrait of the malt ster s dead-end life shows us what\nit's like to be a victim of the system.\nAn intriguing moral and political confrontation is\ndeveloped in Protest, where a television writer who\n'accommodates' the sty stem and is himself\naccommodated by the system tries using a variety of\nabsurd arguments to worm his way out of signing a political petition. And in the third play A Private View,\nVanek is invited round by a couple of Americanised\nsocial climbing friends to admire their newly furnished\nflat. There is much humour in this piece as Michael\nand Vera attempt to show Vanek just what he might\nbe missing. They even go as far as passionately\ns noggin g in front of him saying 'After we've finished\nour little chat with you, we'll show you some more-we'll only be too happy to show you how things are\ndone in this respect.' But in refusing their\nen treatments to join their lifestyle Vanek frustrates\nthem to both epic and comic proportions.\nQED has several meanings, 'quo d erat demon stra num' being the latin version, 'quite easily done' is another\nif you believe the television programme of the same\nname, but it also has a meaning you would not of\nheard of, unless you happen to be a physicist.\nQuantum ele c rod yan mic s is as close to a unified\ntheory that has been achieved, putting all physical\nphenomenon, except gravitational effects and nuclear\nphysics, in terms of three rules. These rules are as\nfollows:\n1. A photon moves from one place to another.\n2. An electron moves from one place to another.\n3. An electron absorbed or emits a photon.\nYou may well ask, 'how does that explain anything\n?', well as most things that happen are so complex\nand involve innumerable applications of these rules\ntheir individual effect cannot be detected easily.\nEven these rule are not as simple as they seem. An\nelectron moving form one place to another may emit\nan electron, and at a latter stage re-absorb its own\nphoton. It can do this any number of times in its\nPage 8\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nWith strong skillful performances and sensitive\ndirection there is much to be enjoyed in this\nproduction: people usually shy away when a play is\nlabelled 'political theatre', but this political theatre is\ntruly accessible.\nAn interesting postscript:\n'Everything's happening at a mad pace, there are no\nready-made politicians of tomorrow able to step in\ntoday. So, for a short period at least, people will have\nto do with symbols-and they are taking me for one,\nthough God knows why. I am on supply, an amateur\nstanding in for a professional politician.

In the third chapter\nthings get slightly more complicated but not\nexcessively so, but in the final one he shoots off at\na tangent, going on about sub-atomic particles and\nthings that are beyond my interests and\nunderstanding. This last chapter does not seem to\nbelong to the rest of the book, it is almost like an after\nthought, a list of things he wanted to say could not\nfit in.\nThis then calls into question who this book is aimed\nfor. Physicists will get bored with the first half (being\nFilm\nThe House of\nBernada Alba\nThe House of Bernada Alba has been adapted from\nthe play by Federico Lorca. Among with other Spanish\nartists, he argued against the totalitarianism which\nabounded in early twentieth century Spain. This story\nis a powerful one in its own right, but there are clearly\ngreater ideas to which he alludes.\nThe plot concerns the family of Bernada Alba, who\nrecently widowed, commits her family to a period of\neight years to mourn the death of her husband. But\nher five daughters are already into womanhood, and\nthe thought of isolation from society, and especially\nmen is too hard for them to bear. The one male figure\nis Pepe el Romano. He is attracted by the wealth of\nthe eldest daughter, Augustias, and comes to court\nher. However, the situation that Bernada has created\nis an explosive one.\nBernada is undoubtedly the key to the story. It is\nher power that lays the rules by which everyone must\nlive. Tragically the morals that she upholds have little\nto do with fairness or justice, they are those of a male\nsociety, const uc ted to their favour. None the less, she\nis merciless in her aims, and any truth that may\ncontradict them, is simply re-written in her mind. It\nis an amusing point to note that some of the most\ntelling and truthful comments are uttered by the\ngrandmother, who is otherwise completely senile.\nWhilst it often lacks the immediacy of theatre, film\nis an excellent conveyor of emotion. Cinema allows\nus to witness the gentler accents of intonation and\nfacial expression that would be lost on stage, a lough it may sometimes miss the compulsiveness of live\nperformance. The credit for this must fall equally on\nboth director, Mario Camus, and the actresses, who\nbring the piece alive. It is also a rare thing that the\nimages of a film can stand alone in their own right,\nand it is a great credit to the director of photography,\nFernando Arribas to have achieved this. This is a powerful drama and it makes compulsive viewing.\nMatthew G. Johnson\nBook\ntoo simple for them), and understand the second while\nthe rest of us will do the reverse but get bored for the\nopposite reason. Sub-atomic particles such as quarks\ndo not seem to effect everyday life so why should we\nworry about them?\nI wondered at several stages 'why bother', all of the\ntheories that have been pulled together using QED can\nbe perfectly well understood using the theory that\nalready exists. What do we gain from the unification\nof theories that appear to be unrelated? Some pure\nresearch does produce results that are of practical\nuse, however most of it does not. Scientist are always\ntrying to find faults in theories, pushing boundaries\nback, making amazing new discoveries, but why?\nPriced at five pounds and only one hundred and fifty\npages it is not very good value for money but if you\nare interested in the subject and are not a physicist\nthem it could be worth reading.\nIan Hodge.\nQED by Richard Feynman\n\n"
