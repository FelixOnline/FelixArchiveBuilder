The Foundation\ncontacted Imperial College in February pointing out that Imperial had yet\nto meet two of the five requirements\nto qualify for Fairtrade status, namely\na commitment to campaign for increased Fairtrade consumption (in the\nform of trade justice campaigns and\na Fairtrade Fortnight) and the formation of a \u201dsteering\u201d committee. Since\nthen Imperial College has met the\ncampaign requirements and has held\na successful Fairtrade Fortnight but a\nfunctional steering committee has yet\nto materialise.\nThe Fairtrade steering committee\nmust have representatives from \u201cthe\nresidential/catering organisation, the\nuniversity authority, the SU executive [and] an appropriate SU society,\neach associated institution\u201d. Once this\nsteering group has met at least twice,\nminutes must then be submitted to\nthe Fairtrade Foundation to prove the\ncommittee\u2019s existence, although it is\nnot explicitly clear which objectives\nthis steering committee must meet\nor how frequently they must come\ntogether.\nFailure of the formation of this committee has led to the Fairtrade Foundation contacting the commercial services department last week to inform\nthen that Imperial College has been\ndropped from the list of Fairtrade uni-versities. Commercial Services Assistant Director Jane Neary then contacted Deputy President of Education and\nWelfare Hannah Theodorou to notify\nthe Union.\nWithout a formal steering committee no University can achieve Fairtade\nstatus, regardless of any other possible\nactions. The fact that both College and\nthe Union have Fairtrade policies, Fairtrade products are now more available\nthan ever in College and Union out-lets, Fairtrade food is served at both\nCollege and Union meetings (includ-ing the wine served at the Chaplaincy\nservices), that Imperial College has\na Fairtrade Society are not enough to\nsecure Fairtrade status. Indeed, even\nif every product that passed through\nthe university from now on bore a\nFairtrade label, Imperial would still\nnot be a Fairtrade university. And the\nfact that the entities that need to be\nrepresented on the steering committee have coordinated in an informal\ncapacity throughout the year is equally\nimportant.\nImperial College became the 65th\nUK University to be granted Fairtrade\nstatus in September 2007 due to the\ncombined efforts of the Fairtrade Society, College and the Union Sabbaticals. Losing Fairtrade approval has had\nno immediate effect on the number of\nFairtrade products available or sales\nbut without the guidelines set out by\nthe Foundation there is nothing to stop\nuniversity outlets replacing Fairtrade\nproducts with more profitable, less\nethical ones.\nSo far there has been no indication\nfrom either the Union or the College\nwill do so, and felix has been told that\nall bodies involved are committed to\nregaining Fairtrade status. And considering the size of the problem and\nthe time taken to process Fairtrade application forms IC could be a fairtrade\ninstitution within two months, but it is\nnot likely that Fairtrade status will be\ngranted again before next year.\nNews in Brief\nUnion Colours nominations open\nFollow felix on Twitter\nThink there is someone that has done a lot for Imperial College Union\nthis year?

Interested, come along to support your band!\nThe world beyond\ncollege walls\nOn Monday May 18th, the\nwar in Sri Lanka came to\nan end after 26 devastating\nyears, as the leaders of the\nLiberation Tigers of Tamil\nEelam (LTTE) were found\ndead on the battlefield.\nThe body of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the vicious founder and leader of the LTTE,\nwas found alongside those of\nhis sons, his head of intelli-gence, and a number of other\ncommanders. Without the 250,000 civilians the rebels had been using as a\nhuman shield, and surrounded by 25,000 governmental troops, the Tigers\nhad little hope of succeeding, despite dispatching suicide bombers and starting fires.\nThe Liberation Tigers, a brutal organisation founded in 1972, wanted an\nindependent Eelam, in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. At its peak, the\nLTTE controlled a quarter of the country, and the rebels weren\u2019t afraid to terrorist tactics, including the assassination of a former Indian prime minister.\nThe UN estimates that 8000 civilians have died since January alone, and over\n250,000 have been displaced. President Mahinda Rajapaksa now faces the\ndifficult task of reuniting the country.\nSri Lanka\nVoters cast their ballots for parliamentary and presidential elections on\nTuesday in one of Africa\u2019s poorest, but fastest growing countries.\nMalawi has seen economic growth averaging 7 percent in the past three\nyears, and is expected to be the second fastest growing economy (after Qatar)\nthis year. President Bingu wa Mutharika\u2019s strong economic record makes him\na favourite among foreign investors, as he has secured billions of dollars in\ndebt relief from developed nations. Malawi depends heavily on tobacco exports but is banking on a uranium mine which opened last month to diversify\nits economy.\nWa Mutharika\u2019s chances of victory could have increased further after the\nConstitutional Court upheld a decision to prevent former President Bakili\nMuluzi from contesting. Mr Muluzi stepped down in 2004 after a failed attempt to change the constitution to let him stand for a third term. Wa Mutharika stepped up to took office following an election marred by violence and\naccusations of rigging. Seven candidates, including one woman, are in the\nrace\nMalawi\nA week ago, Rodrigo\nRosenberg, a lawyer in\nCaracas was shot dead in\nthe streets.\nWhat he left behind was a\nvideo in which he said that\nshould anything happen to\nhim, it would be at the behest of the President Alvaro\nColom.\nMr. Rosenberg said officials might want to kill him\nbecause he represented Khalil Musa, a businessman who was slain in March\nalong with his daughter. The lawyer said Mr. Musa, who had been named to\nthe board of the Rural Development Bank of Guatemala, was killed for refusing to get involved in illicit transactions at the bank.\nMr Colon denies any allegations. This week saw huge protests in the capi-tal, Guatemala city, demanding the president\u2019s resignation. However supporters of Mr Colon, mostly rural poor who have benefitted from his social programs, staged equally impressive counter-protests. American FBI\nagents have landed in Guatemala this week to investigate the killing of Mr\nRosenberg.\nGuatemala\nEdited by Hassan Joudi & Raphael Houdmont\nE\nX\nC\nE\nP\nT\nI\nM\nP\nE\nR\nI\nA\nL\nC\nO\nL\nL\nE\nG\nE\nLOLCATZ\nof\nteH\nWEEK\nHumanities options severely\nlimited from next year\nDan Wan\nEditor-in-Prowling\nIn a response to budget cuts in all departments and a strategic review of the\nCollege\u2019s humanities provision, Imperial College is planning to discontinue\nparts of the highly popular Undergraduate Humanities programme. This includes the total abolishment of some\ncourses altogether.\nfelix has managed to get its paws on\nthe Department of Humanities\u2019 latest\nStaff Consultation Paper, and understand that the proposals brought up in\na Review of Humanities report by the\nStrategic Education Committee have\npassed the Senate, the highest officiating body within College.\nThe proposed cuts are outlined in\nthe paper by the listing of potential\nteaching posts \u2018at risk of redundancy\u2019,\nbefore heading into a 30 day consultation period with staff to find their\nviews on the proposals. College hope\nto bring in the cuts from October 2009,\nthe next academic year, whilst October\n2010 could see even further reductions\nin teaching personnel within the Department of Humanities.\nThese reductions under the review\nare said to be in-line with developing strategic goals of the College,\nwhich wish to see every student better\neducated in ethics and communication within science and their degree\nspeciality.\nThe proposals to go ahead, from next\nyear four non-language humanities\ncourses will see daytime courses withdrawn from the selection Undergraduates can enrol in. Art in the Twentieth\nCentury, Modern Literature and Drama Lecturer, Roman Empire, and Film\nStudies will cease to run, with the involved teaching staff to be redeployed\nwithin the Department.\nLunchtime language courses are often in high demand, but will also be\nheavily affected by the budget cuts.\nTeaching hours will severely reduced\nacross the board over the next two\nyears.\nLanguage courses for undergraduate courses typically consist of two or\nthree hours of classes each week, running through the Autumn and Spring\nterms of the academic year. Imperial\nCollege currently offer eight language\ncourses, typically tiered in level of abil-ity. In a course such as French where\nfull provision of differing ability-based\nclasses, 2008, tiers are labelled for Beginners, Near Beginners, Intermediate,\nHigh Intermediate and Advanced.\nFrom next year, there shall be no en-try-level courses (i.e. level 1 or 2) in any\nlanguage. This comes after criticisms\nthat languages at these preliminary\nlevels are not of the same academic\nworth as an alternative core module\nof that student\u2019s degree, especially in\nlight of it being accredited towards a\nfinal degree honours. All languages\nwill hence require GCSE or equivalent\nstandard prior to commencement of\nthe language course. Mandarin is the\nonly course that escapes this new rul-ing, but is set for further review next\nyear in view of similarly eliminating\nlevel 1 and 2 teaching. In more drastic budget cutting measures, Japanese,\nArabic and Italian courses will be reduced to paying evening classes only,\nand hence will not be offered as a daytime credit course to undergraduates.\nThe cuts to be made, are summarised\nin the table below.\nHumanities courses are offered\nto undergraduates as credit or non-credit. As a credit course, Humanities\ncan be worth up to the equivalent of\na single degree module, and typically\ntaken in the second or third year of\nthe degree. Enthusiastic students can\nsacrifice their lunchtimes out of choice\nand take up any remaining places on\nhumanities courses at the cost of \u00a3175\nEvening classes are also available to\nstudents and staff of the College, with\nenrolment costing 130 pounds for an\nacademic year. There are no plans or\nproposals for evening classes to be cut\nat this stage.\nUnder the review of Humanities pro-gramme, there will be an equalisation\nof credit worth across all degree courses that require a humanities module to\nbe taken. For example, under current\nstructures, a humanities course for a\nstudent on a Biology degree is worth\n0.45 course units. This is whilst for a\nBiochemistry undergraduate attending\nthe same class and taking the same ex-ams, the course is worth considerably\nless to their degree at 0.25 course units.\nCollege advertise as their humanities\nprogramme to be \u2018an important contribution to [a student\u2019s] general education\u2019 by providing \u2018creative activity\nnot amenable to the quantitative techniques of science and technology.\u2019 The\nimportance of this in all-science university is something evident amongst\nthe student population. One student\ninvolved in a credit language course\nthis year responded to the proposed\nbudget cuts negatively.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s sad that the cuts are being\nmade, because learning new languages\nor about subjects such as Modern Literature is one of the most interesting\nthings you can do at Imperial outside\nof your course.\u201d\nAnother student saw sense in the\nnew Humanities programme structure.\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that people in language\ncourses are more fluent in that language than they initially let on. There\u2019s\nvery little regulation of this, and it\u2019s not\nfair that it\u2019s so easy for them to pick up\nmarks towards their degrees in this\nway. I think it is sensible for them to\ncutting the beginner levels.\u201d\nEither way you see it, the decisions\nhave seemingly been made upon the\nreview of the Humanities programme.\nSo, first years taking up humanities for\ntheir second year will see their options\nseverely limited.\nENTIRELY:\n1.

    "content": "back is far worse than going forwards. It soon dawned on us that\nthis day was going to be a long one, and our decision to have lunch\nbefore the hard part meant our food supplies were quickly running\nout. The narrow rock scrambling of the ridge has awesome views\nall around mainly because the drops to both sides are so steep. To\nthe south, the wall drops away to Glen Coe, a few hundred feet\nbelow and to the north to be honest I can\u2019t describe it. Low cloud\nbegan to creep in on us and now and then far below us we glimpsed\na marsh and some streams. At one bit in particular the path appeared to have fallen away into the valley and the group found different ways around this \u2018hiccough\u2019. Even Jim, hardened veteran of\nthe hills, described this moment as \u201cthe scariest thing ever\u201d. Our\nsometimes slow, sometimes cold and wet, sometimes violently icy\nscrambling took us late into the afternoon and it was past seven by\nthe time we reached the second Munro and end of the route, Sgorr\nnam Fiannaidh. By then the weather had closed in and the summit\nwas cloudy.\nOur descent from the ridge followed a vague path straight down\na cliff. The pub was visible in the distance and to the fading light\nthose of us at the back gave everyone within hearing a classic rendition of \u2018I\u2019m Dreaming of a White Easter\u2019. We also gave serious\nthought to what would happen if we saw a T-Rex in the valley. We\nconcluded that it would get drunk at the pub and that danger was\nminimal.\nJust as we were worried about night falling, the sun shone beautifully over the waters of Loch Linnhe and lit up the surrounding\nclouds and the face of our mountain in gold. Some things you miss\nby finishing too early. The sky became darker and we finished outside the pub at around ten, night finally upon us. That night was\nScottish night which meant Haggis, Neeps and Tatties for dinner.\nNeedless to say we were all quite hungry after our twelve-hour day.\nAfter the nail-biting, muscle-ripping experience of the day be-fore, our plan for Saturday was an easier walk, with as little scrambling as possible and a relatively simple route. Sgorr Dhearg and\nSgorr Dhonuill are a twin set of Munros to the west of Glen Coe\nwhich rise up from Loch Linnhe above the town of Ballachulish,\nthe most horrible modern town I have ever seen, with plastic-age\nhouses and bugger all to look at. The weather was similar to the day\nbefore and after getting lost behind barbed-wire fences in the town\nwe began our gentle ascent up the first slope. Jiri set a good pace\nin and around the heather hillside and\nwe were soon high above the Loch,\npast the tiny scrambling section and\non the summit of Sgorr Dhearg. After\nthe day before I think everyone was\nsurprised at how easy it seemed. The\nwind was light and we could see far\ninto the distance, though Ben Nevis\nwas covered in cloud. Following the\ncol round its curved ridge we skirted\nthe edge of the snow-turned-ice which\nhad clung to the north face, protected\nand out of the wind. The summit of\nSgorr Dhonuill was in a cloud when\nwe reached it but somehow with\nthe lack of wind it was warm, even\nthough a little snow fell. The biscuits\nand whisky were out within seconds.\nIn navigating our way off this second Munro back down to Ballachulish we ended up going south instead\nof north, something the compasses\nprobably would have been useful in\ntelling us but then again, we were in\nno hurry. Jon immediately offered to\nunleash his high-performance ultra-tech state-of-the-art GPS, which\nworked fine until about 3pm every\nday when the batteries died. Unluckily for his testosterone, we\nfound the way off the mountain before resorting to the technology.\nThe trail led us for about a kilometre next to a stream through a\nplantation, the ground covered in moss and the whole setting very\natmospheric. I don\u2019t even want to mention the thing that looked\nlike a sheep carcass covered in blood. I\u2019m sure it was just my im-agination. Our last few miles were along a forestry road that made\nmy feet feel like sandpaper and several injuries came back to haunt\nme. We had good views of a clear Pap of Glen Coe which we had\nclimbed on day one and finally, as always happens as the end of a\ngood day, the sun came out.\nSunday was our final day walking in Scotland. The week so far had\nbeen scary at times, funny at times, always exciting and frequently\nwet. There were plenty of injuries to go around and we were at that\ninteresting place in being tired but also getting used to the strain.\nAs it was the last day, only another epic ascent would suffice and so\nthe ridge of Buachaille Etive Mor, marking the eastern end of Glen\nCoe and rising like a storm out of the plain was an obvious choice.\nThe weather too was perfect. Driving up the road to the base of the\nmountain was like driving into the sky, so low was the cloud and\nso bright the light. The sky was blue and dotted with clouds. Our\nclimb took us along the sides of a stream and slowly got steeper\nuntil we reached the top of the col and the view stretched away to\nthe south with Creise still capped with snow filling our view. From\nthe top of Stob Dearg we could see far to the east over Rannoch\nMoor to where the wet moorland blended into the sky. The day was\nso beautiful and, it being our last one, the group split. The majority\nof the group completed the whole of Buachaille Etive Mor including its two Munros; Stob Dearg and Stob na Broige. Four of us however extended the walk to include another set of mountains, a ridge\ncalled Buachaille Etive Beag which lies to the west of Buachaille\nEtive Mor. In this last day there was something for everyone, and by\nthe end of our epic trek over four Munros the breakaway group of\nfour, Gavin, Nathaniel, Jim and I only just got back to the minibus\nafter the others. So much so in fact that we saw it drive past on the\nway back to the hut about 100 metres from where we were standing\non the hill. After trying unsuccessfully to hitch-hike in a refrigerated van we finally made contact and Rafal returned to collect us. The\nsun was still out and only in a brief moment on top of Buachaille\nEtive Beag did we need waterproofs. I may or may not have nearly\ncaused a landslide which may or may not have nearly taken out Jim,\nbut sometimes you have to learn the scary way whether walking up\na sixty degree scree slope is a good idea or not.\nThe Scotland trip of \u201909 was a great success. The high cloud made\nfor a great set of views for the week and with the huge choice of\nwalks we were spoilt. We got to know the pub well, especially when\nthe ale selection quadrupled on the last day, and all our cooking\nadventures turned out mostly successful. We played Werewolf at\nsome point but the day escapes me; I had no idea most of the time\nwhich day of the week it was, which was a relief after coming from\nLondon. Everyone was sad to leave on Monday, especially since the\nweather was getting better, but we certainly made the most of the\ntime we had. I\u2019m proud to say that the drying room, and its specific\nsmell made from the blend of many different types of wet clothes,\nwill never be the same again, thanks to a little group of us called the\nFellwanderers (www.fellwanderers.com).\nG\nlen Coe, just over ten miles south of Fort William in\nthe Highlands of Scotland, is a legendary place. It is\na valley famous in history as the site of the massacre of the MacDonald clan, which began the highland clearances and the end of the way of life of the\nHighlanders. The scenery fits perfectly with its bloody past and its\nadventurous present, where walkers and climbers scale the surrounding mountains. To the north, the ridge of Aonach Eagach is\nwell known as one of the narrowest ridges in Scotland and takes\nin two Munros; opposite on the south side lie the Three Sisters,\nmassive buttresses which overlook the Glen, whilst south-east the\ntwo ridges of Buachaille Etive Beag and Buachaille Etive Mor run\nnorth to south, the most photographed area in Scotland. From the\ntop of any of the Glen Coe peaks you can see west down Loch Linnhe to the Isle of Mull and the Atlantic Ocean. To the east beyond\nBuachaille Etive Mor the mountains drop to Rannoch Moor, a vast\nbog which stretches off into the distance even on the clearest day.\nThis was what lay at the end of our fourteen hour minibus journey \u2018into the frozen north\u2019. Jim and Caroline were picked up at service stations and Jon managed to find the way to what seemed to me\nthe biggest shopping complex in all of Scotland, where we squashed\nfour days worth of food for fifteen people into all the free space\nleft in the minibus. The conversation to decide dinner pretty much\nwent along the lines of \u2018What\u2019s good?\u2019 \u2018-Stew\u2019 \u2018-Yeah, let\u2019s get lots of\nvegetables and lots of potatoes\u2019 \u2018-Yeah \u2026 for four days?\u2019 \u2018-Yeah why\nnot?\u2019 It was at this point that Caroline and Jim, who can both cook,\ncame to the rescue of Nathaniel and myself, who probably would\nhave caused a mutiny. Rice and pasta were quickly added.\nWe drove away in the dark and the rain. For further notice, Morrisons is better than Asda in their ale selection.\nFor some reason, it\u2019s always raining when we\u2019re using the roof\nrack. This means climbing on top of a slippery tarpaulin in the rain\n3 metres above the ground and trying to undo the knots which\nfor some reason back in London we had decided needed to be the\nmost complicated knots in existence. Eventually the bags, mostly\ndry, were inside our new home, the \u2018Alpine\u2019 bothy, owned by the\nGlencoe Independent Hostel. The beds were comfy, complete with\nduvets and pillows and the kitchen had an impressive selection of\nequipment. There were even showers! It soon dawned on us that\nthe two heating lamps, both bright red and capable of lighting up\nthe whole bothy made the place look like a brothel. Everyone immediately got perverse ideas. Or maybe that was just me.\nThe first day of a tour is normally a break-in day, getting everyone used to the strenuous mountains of Scotland. The Pap of\nGlen Coe, a cone-shaped mountain where the valley meets the loch\nseemed like a brilliant start. It was overcast but the cloud was high,\nas it would stay for the rest of the week. The sun broke through for\ntwenty minutes at the beginning of the day and soon we were high\non the mountain looking back on a rainbow which ended in the\nstream we had just passed. Nathaniel was spending the day in the\npub \u2018working\u2019 and most of the group were recovering from the Four\nInns challenge a few days before but still we made good progress\nand soon we were on top of the Pap. And so was the cloud. And\nthe wind. We didn\u2019t stay long but made our way down to the col for\nlunch before heading up to our first Munro of the trip, Sgorr nam\nFiannaidh. The top was wrapped in cloud and the climb wasn\u2019t too\nsteep but conditions soon deteriorated. In order to escape the wind\nlashing at my face, we nearly completely missed the summit, until\nFlorian helpfully pointed out that we were going downhill instead\nof up. The wind was now at our side, ripping everything including Jim nearly off the mountain, and we only had a short break at\nthe summit before beginning the slippery descent back to the road.\nOnce out from under the cloud the view opened up towards Kinlochleven but everyone was quite wet by this stage. The bog covered\nin heather; small waterfalls soaked even the rocks and the clumps\nof grass grouped together above the peaty soil. This was Scotland.\nMost of the group slipped and fell down the slope but everyone\nkept up good spirits despite the weather. Back at the hut we were\nproud to have given everyone a classic Scotland experience \u2013 those\nwho had injuries were worse and those who hadn\u2019t had injuries now\ndid.\nThat night we went on a rescue mission to the Clachaig Inn,\nwhich apparently had some beer that needed drinking. Nathaniel\nfinished and sent his final-year coursework from the pub (a true\nstudent) and the conversation turned to philosophy \u2013 it was soon\nagreed that a chance encounter with the Taliban, although unlikely,\nwould not be good for the trip. We were not ones to be complacent.\nOvernight it snowed. Morning showed us the white icy peaks\nof the surrounding mountains. It had not descended to the valley\nbut the peaks looked treacherous. The plan was to attempt Bidean\nnam Bian and Stob Coire Sgreamhach, the two Munros of which the\nThree Sisters are merely rocky tendrils breaking over Glen Coe. The\nplan was simple, sneak up a small\nvalley to the G Buttress, summit\nthe peaks and then make a slippery descent of the well-forested\nLost Valley. Unfortunately things\nwere going to get a bit hairy. We\ntook a path most of the way up the\nsteep valley in moderate weather\nuntil we hit the snow line. The\nsnow, which had mostly fallen the\nnight before was still powdery and\nperfectly shaped over the underlying rocks and vegetation. To make\nthings interesting we took a bearing and trudged off over the snow\nto the west ridge of Stob coire nan\nLochan, the peak before our main\ngoal of Bidean nam Bian. During\nour ascent the sky was clearing\nand shafts of sunlight warmed us\nagainst the wind and knee-deep\nsnow. Florian ploughed on ahead\nand before long we were at the\nsummit. About 10 minutes after everyone had reached the summit the weather decided that it was to be the end of our day and\nwe were surrounded with biting hail. It was a white-out. Glimpses\nthrough the cloud at our planned route soon alerted us that much\nof the route was probably impossible, even for the Fellwanderers\nwith their up-to-date ice climbing equipment *cough* such as extra\nbiscuits and \u2026 err \u2026 jelly babies (okay this is a slight digression but\nwho the hell thought that a good sweet design would be jelly in the\nshape of babies?!?! Seriously \u2013 a BIT creepy?!). Anyway, Nathaniel\ndecided that we should get down into the Lost Valley as quickly\nas possible, and luckily the col below us looked like it offered the\nmost gradual descent. Unfortunately, \u2018most gradual\u2019 in a Scottish\nice storm means a snow cliff. We broke through the overhanging\nsnow and descended, one by one, kicking steps into the snow cliff,\nuntil we reached a relatively flat area (about 45 degrees).\nOnce regrouped, our nerves shattered, the walk down through\nthe Lost Valley was picturesque, and after we got out of the range\nof avalanches the mood was even jolly! The Lost Valley is a flat plain\nhigh above Glen Coe, its entrance screened by trees and boulders\nso that from the main valley it is impossible to see. Waterfalls from\nthe surrounding cliffs join at the head of the plain before their final\nrush down into Glen Coe. A scramble around some boulders and\na slight river crossing led us to a path, at the end of which was the\nminibus.\nThat night we checked the weather and saw that the next day was\nmeant to be the worst of the week before slowly getting better. Like\ntrue heroes of the mountains, we decided to have a day off and go\nto visit Oban. This was great news for everyone with wet kit (eve-ryone) as it meant another day for boots etc. in the hostel\u2019s drying\nroom. I must admit that when I first visited the drying room I was\nhappy to spend some decent time inside making sure my kit was\nneatly spread out for drying to be most efficient. By the end of the\nweek the room smelt like several wayward animals had died inside.\nOban, however, was a lovely place. Our tour of the whisky distillery was the most generous I can remember, with glasses and many\ndrams of whisky thrown in. Everyone spread out in the afternoon\nto explore the town, and somehow managed to nearly all meet up\nin the Oban chocolate shop about an hour after leaving the distill-ery. Students know what to do on a bad-weather day! This day of\nluxury culminated in another shopping trip to Tesco, which nearly\nsent Rafal mad with its hidden car park entrance. During this shopping trip Jim and I suggested that a good meal might be Spaghetti\nCarbonara. People heard us. No one thought to stop us. That night\nwe had Spaghetti Carbonara. Jesus. No one has ever seen so much\nCarbonara. We could at least have helped everyone if the sauce\nhad tasted good. It was cheese-cream that had the consistency of\nphlegm. Strange thing was that the sauce was finished. Fate had not\ngiven the spaghetti such luck. It was a night to remember.\nThankfully for everyone, the spaghetti would be burnt off the\nnext day as we attempted a truly epic walk, the Aonach Eagach\nridge, famous as a long day\u2019s walk for those without a nervous dis-position. We drove to one end of the ridge and the plan was to walk\nalong part of it and then back to the minibus. The weather was\ngood and the clouds were even above Ben Nevis which was visible for most of the day to the north, covered in snow and even\n\u2013 now and then \u2013 bathed in sunlight. Before the ridge even began\nwe ascended the Devil\u2019s Staircase, part of the West Highland Way\nwhich was nothing more than a slightly steep path. There were a\nfew startled looks when Nathaniel led us off-road into a bog but\nour route soon became clear as we found rock beneath our feet and\nthe wide part of the ridge opened out before us, all the way up to\nour first peak Sron Gharbh. The snow on the ridge had all melted\nfrom the night before but on each side of us to the north and south\nthe mountains rose higher and the snow was still visibly thick. Our\nroute up to Meall Dearg, the first Munro of the day was via our first\nobstacle, a rock face we had to scramble down called The Chancellor (or Alistair Darling). Since our original plan was to leave the\nridge at Meall Dearg, The Chancellor would have been the hardest\nbit on the route. It soon turned out to be the easiest as Rafal and\nOllie had decided to return to the minibus, allowing us to attempt\nthe whole ridge and finish back at the hostel.\nThe rest of the ridge can only be described as a Mecca of scram-bling, comparable only to the north ridge of Tryfan in its majesty.\nThe main difference between the Aonach Eagach and Tryfan is\nthan on the Aonach Eagach there is no escape; you cannot go down\neither side; there is no gentle path if you get tired of the rocks; going\n21\nFriday 22 May 2009 felix\nClubs & Societies Is your club cooler than the cat that\ngot the cream?

The women\u2019s quad\n(W4x) dominated every heat to take\ngold in their elite final on Saturday and\nthird on Sunday, while the pair (W2-)\nof Ellie Dorman and Erica Thompson\nfinished third overall.\nThe first win on Saturday went to the\nwomen\u2019s quad of Rachael Davies/Nicky\nSmith/Erica Thompson/Ro Smith who\neasily won their heat and was the fastest qualifier into the final (7:18.66).\nThe quad went on to win gold in the\nfinal in a time of 7:15.66, over 6 seconds ahead of Gentse RS (Belgium) in\nsecond and was presented with medals\nin a ceremony after the race. There was\nlittle time to rest for the squad, most\nof who were doubling up in events\nthroughout the day. The women\u2019s 8+\n(Ellie Dorman/Rachael Davies/Nicky\nSmith/Erica Thompson/Selina Graham/Chloe Symmonds/Louise Hart/\nRo Smith) came second in their heat\nin a time of 7:08.08 behind Upper\nThames RC which was the third fastest\nqualifying time. Imperial claimed silver in the final: second only to Wallingford RC who finished in 7:09.77 with\nUpper Thames settling for bronze. The\ncrew was presented with medals, flowers and a noose for reasons vaguely explained in a history leaflet handed to\ncrews.\nOn Sunday the W4- (Duffy/Graham/\nSymmonds/Hart) heat starting time\nwas 20 minutes after the W8+ starting\ntime and it was intended to race the 8+,\njump out and into the mini-bus and\ndrive up the course to the start where\nthe 4- would be waiting having been\nrowed up by other IC squad members.\nThe 8+ (Cox: Connie Pidoux/Ellie\nDorman/Ro Smith/Nicky Smith/Erica\nThompson/Selina Graham/Christina\nDuffy/Louise Hart/Rachael Davies)\ntook control of the opening heat and\nConnie called a reduction in rate to\nfinish in second and qualify for the\nfinal, without exhausting those having to race afterwards. Hart, Graham\nand Duffy dashed from the boat into\nthe revving mini-bus with coach Steele\nat the wheel. The bus blasted up the\ncourse to the start line where the three\njumped out. But there was no sign of\nthe 4-. Coach Steele completed a 180\u00b0\nturn and took off back down the road\nto find the boat. Unfortunately Belgian police were having none of it and\nafter being chased by a raving officer\nbanging on the bus windows Steele\nwas forced to pull over. After patiently\nenduring the Belgian waffle he was ordered to turn due to one-way traffic\naround the lake. Meanwhile the three\nheadless chickens were at the start\nwithout a boat had to sprint along the\ntowpath from the start line to the 1000\nmetre mark where the boat had been\nwaiting after a confusion of where to\nmeet. The crew got into their boat\nand took off like a bag of spanners towards the start, but were too late. Just\nfifty metres from the startline the W4heat passed them by. Disappointment\nwas consoled by the thought of an impending elite W8+\u2019s final and the crew\ncomposed themselves with a solid row\nback.\nWith qualifying times posted for the\nW8+ final IC were well under the radar\nfinishing 5/7th fastest qualifier due to\ntheir conserving of energy tactics. A\nmaster race plan was devised by cox\nConnie Pidoux and Coach Steele: a\nplan which cannot be revealed for obvious legal reasons. Pidoux\u2019s presence\nwas immense in the boat and after a\nsolid start the IC crew held level with\nall crews until the 250m mark. With\nthe first push IC starting eeking ahead\nand began to pull away from the pack.\nOther crews attempted pushes to\nregain dominance but IC were unstoppable with Pidoux at the helm; \u201cThey\nare doing their pushes and we are still\ngoing faster.\u201d Coach Steele was following on a bicycle and reports to being \u201cunable to stop smiling\u201d as other\ncoaches had to watch their crews slip\nback down the pack and swallow their\npre-race chat about the potential outcome of the race. With 200 metres\nto go Pidoux was on the bow ball of\nfastest (7:04.11) heat qualifiers Comb\nBelfast/Tethys/Wallingford and with\n100 metres to go there was clear wa-ter. IC took gold in a blistering 6:58.62,\nwith composite Comb Belfast/Tethys/\nWallingford in second (7:04.34) and\nWallingford RC (who had beaten IC\nto gold the previous day) came third in\n7:07.61.\nBoats were de-rigged and loaded and\nwithout delay it was straight back to\nLondon with all windows widely open.\nThis was a very successful weekend for\nthe women\u2019s squad collecting 22 medals and a cup over two days with just\n15 athletes against elite international\ncompetition.

Not\nphysically, That would\nbe awful and not something I would\nshare. Somewhat a personal matter if\nthat had happened. Well on to the not\nso horric storey.\nMy first \u201crape\u201d as it were was in last\nweeks edition of felix. The puzzles\neditor, or general or whatever it is, decided to edit my lovely storey about\nmy shopping expedition to westfileds\nshopping center. Kindly saying that\nmy better half was the one who bought\nmy new clothes and insinuating that\nI\u2019m kept. This was further propagated\nby the horoscope where I have been\ntold that I have Changed. Truth is I\nhave changed, I hve had a hair cut and\nbough some new clothes. What i don;t\nunderstand is why there is a need to\nstate this. I am still the same person, I\nstill talk the same, walk the same, and\ndo the same things. In essence I have\nonly changed in apperence. And so\nwhat. If Charles Murdoch is waiting for\nme to break and get pissed off, he may\nhave to wait a while. i don\u2019t particularly\ncare, and I am not writing this storey to\nin retalliation to anything. I am writing\nit because sadly it\u2019s the most interst-ing thing that has happened in the last\nweek. I believe it has something to do\nwith exams crushing my available time\nto go and be a complete idiot. Ah well,\ntime for the second Raping.\nThe second time was the classic facebook rape. I foolishly left myself logged\ninto facebook one night while in the\nfelix office, to which all the editors remaining in the office decided to molest\nmy facebook profile towards a gay ori-entation. I laugh though as the status\nupdate was:\n\u201cWANTED: middle-aged male, eager for wild sex, preferable fetish more\nS&M and bondage gear, must be non-allergic to latex and have strong arse\nmuscle grip for my miniature penis.\nPrice negotiable. \u201c\nThis was quite funny, however the\nrandom homosexual friends I had\nnewly acquired left me some disturbing messages. Such as :\n\u201chey sweets. soon some time? what\nabout you? where can we go? x \u201c\nAs well as old friends relishing in\nmy misfortune. I thought this would\namuse you guys in a time of \u201chard\u201d\nrevision.

I checked\nthe time: it had just\npassed six. Too early. The\npiercing sunlight kept away any hope\nof falling back to sleep; still I tumbled\nback to a snooze, waking up two hours\nlater to sounds of the medina.\nThey were heavy raindrops rather\nthan chatters of Moroccans going\nabout their business.\nDespite the discouragement, I got\nout of bed.\nNot that F\u00e8s had little to offer. Legend (Lonely Planet, that is) has it that\nthe inhabitants of F\u00e8s go to bed every\nnight, knowing that their city is the\ntrue centre of Morocco. Founded in\n789 AD, F\u00e8s was established as the\ncapital of the first Moroccan imperial\ndynasty and remained so for centuries.\nIts intellectual, cultural, artistic and\nreligious advancements soared since\nmedieval times, even when its role as\npolitical capital was in steady decline;\nlittle wonder that Fassis (residents of\nF\u00e8s) were widely regarded as the cultural \u00e9lite of Morocco.\nA visitor would consider soaking up\nin the elixir of artistic genius from the\nentire city: with our tight schedule, we\ndisregarded the Ville Nouvelle and F\u00e8s\nel-Jdid (New F\u00e8s) and headed straight\nfor F\u00e8s el-Bali, the Old Town of F\u00e8s,\nwhich granted the city the status of the\nlargest living Islamic medieval city in\nthe world.\nOn the previous night we had stag-gered, after an 11-hour coach ride,\ninto F\u00e8s el-Bali at its climax, instantly\nhyped by its intoxicating charm of\nArabic commercialism; stepping out\nof Hotel Cascade, the rain appeared to\nhave flushed out all forms of liveliness\nfrom the hives.\nAfter settling for a glass of mint tea\nlike a true Moroccan, I briefly left\nAnna behind to explore the very souks\nthat are the essence of Old F\u00e8s.\n*\nLahlou Ahmed didn\u2019t own La Porte\ndu Peintre: his father did. Nor was he\nresponsible for the majority of paintings exhibited in the miniscule gallery:\nhis father was. He had no obligations\nto maintain the store \u2012 arguably the\nlargest Talaa Seghira (one of F\u00e8s elBali\u2019s main alleys) \u2012 save familial ties.\nWhich means a lot in Moroccan terms.\nStill, he liked being there, surrounded by colours and aromas of oil paints.\nIt was a good break from his education\nas a student in Arabic, yet not too great\na venture from the cultural enlightenment he loved.\nBut today was just outright miser-able. He stepped out for some fresh\nair, head filled with the tunes and lyrics\nhe would sing when his friends came\naround tonight. In his breath he cursed\nthe rain, for disrupting the rhythm and\nfending off his customers.\n\u201cWith art, there\nwas a third\noption beside\n\u2018you like it\u2019 or\n\u2018you dislike it\u2019\u2018you appreciate\nit\u2019\u201d\nThat was when he saw the Asian kid\nwith the green t-shirt, blue waterproof,\nswaggering down the street like an advertisement logo for shopkeepers.\nAnd he seemed interested by the\nartwork. And seeking shelter from the\ndownpour.\nEffortlessly, Lahlou had himself a potential buyer.\nHe gave him the space and time required for perusal, to his heart\u2019s con-tent. The holy-water man portrait,\nby a travelling art student, caught his\neye. Lahlou smirked \u2012 he knew that\nlook very well, one he had seen many\ntimes from art-lovers who unearthed\nhis muse behind a piece of work, and\nsensed that spark of connection.\nHe claimed he had a travel companion who would be delighted to visit\nthe shop: he had to go fetch her from\nthe hotel. The classic getaway excuse.\nBut no, he was too hooked to pitch an\nescape. So Lahlou returned the hand-shake, bid m\u2019a ssalama willingly and\nwatched him burrow his way out of the\ngallery.\nHard-selling was unnecessary: it was\nbecause, Lahlou understood, with art,\nthere was a third option beside \u2018you\nlike it\u2019 or \u2018you dislike it\u2019 \u2012 \u2018you appreciate it\u2019.\n*\nI returned to Hotel Cascade and delivered the news of my discovery. Anna\nwas now more than determined to\nbuy a painting for her boyfriend; I too\nfound myself gradually succumbing to\nthe temptation to make the purchase.\nSomeone (or something) mentioned\nhow easy it is to lose yourself in the\nmedina. True, I discovered, yet not\nbecause of its labyrinthine orientation.\n\u201cIt was the\ndifficulty to\nrevisit a shop\nas, distorted by\nthe many vibrant\nsights you see\nalong the way,\nyour recollection\nrefused to\nfunction, even\non one long\nstraight path.\u201d\nFor a distance that took me less than\nten minutes \u2012 or so I thought \u2012 Anna\nand I needed twice as much. With the\nrain diminishing by the minute, locals\nand tourists alike had ruptured out of\ntheir cocoons and restoring life to the\nsouks. Perhaps that did no favours to\nmy orientation skills.\nWe found La Porte de Peintre even-tually. Lahlou welcomed me and my\ncompanion with open arms, once\nagain left us in our silent admiration\non volumes of masterpieces arranged\nacross the walls.\nIn the end, Anna settled for two\npaintings, and I the portrait that had\ncaptured my heart. With our new-gained bargaining skills, harvested\nwhen in Casablanca and Marrakesh,\nwe came out from the bartering game\nwith a decent price. As Lahlou dismantled the canvases for transport, we\ngot down to a hearty conversation and\ngained insight to each other\u2019s lives.\nHe revealed to me his involvement in\na local Moroccan music band.\n\u201cCome back at eight tonight when\nmy friends and I play music here. We\nwill be honoured to have your com-pany, sadik.\u201d\nPromises aside, we paid and departed with three fantastic pieces of art,\nand a new friend. Curious enough, it\nwas roughly when the sun broke out\nfrom elusion.\n*\nMohammed was idle. The Talaa Kebira was bustling with life \u2012 there just\nweren\u2019t enough tourists.\nThere were at least two gawking at\nthe majesty that was Medersa Bou Inania. Perfect targets.\nEnsha\u2019llaah, he thought as he approached for the kill; they will want to\ncontinue shopping rather than visiting\nthe Medersa.\n\u201cExcuse me, can I help?\u201d\nThey seemed unthreatened. He went\nahead to the doorkeeper to probe the\nentrance fee of the Medersa, when they\nexpressed their doubts about visiting\nthe college. Returning with the infor-mation, Mohammed had established\nsome mutual trust.\nAnd now for the killer question.\n\u201cWould you like to buy some spices?\u201d\nHe had struck a harmony. Before\nthey could gesture their approval,\nhe guided them through a back alley\nwhere his cousin\u2019s shop was tucked\nneatly behind a corner. The shopkeepers sprang to life at the sight of new\ncustomers, briskly led them through\nan introductory on their goods.\nMohammed kicked back on a couch,\nwatched bemusedly as the Asian bloke\npoked his nose on samples of cumin and spice mixes, and his Caucasian lady friend pursued inquisitively\non massage oils. The bill continued\nmounting \u2012 he felt satisfaction for not\nonly gratifying his guests, but also the\ntip that awaits.\nThey were on the move with their\nbounty. He fumbled around his djella-ba pocket for his prized photography,\nonly to realise he had left it behind. He\ncursed under his breath \u2012 only if he\ncould show it off and tell tales of his\ngetting stoned with Bono only a week\nago\u2026\n*\nAndrew and Kag, fellow hitchers we\nCourtyard of Medersa Bou Inania\nhad met on the previous night, rendezvoused with us by the entrance of\nHotel Cascade. As we exchanged encounters of our wanders over mint tea,\nI made the suggestion.\nTruth to be told, having lived\nthrough the disappointment of missing\nthe Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca,\nthird-largest of its kind in the world, an\nIslamic architectural experience at the\nMedersa Bou Inania was not too much\nto ask. Especially when we hadn\u2019t had\nthe chance (and privilege) to visit a\nmosque.\nNot that the theology college was a\nmere substitute. Constructed by the\nMerenid Sultan Bou Inan, it represented the Merenid Dynasty\u2019s (1276 -1465) excellence in Berber craftsman-ship. Also a mosque, it once housed\nsome of the brightest minds in Muslim\ntheology.\nMy craving was now fulfilled. Stuffed\nwere my eyes with imageries of shades\narranged in tiles or perfect symmetry,\nrising in columns that transformed\ninto plastered pillars, every inch dedicated with engraving of Islamic sym-bols; they then converged into the\nelaboration and splendour that was the\nwooden layering.\nWaiting patiently for the tourist to\ndisperse, I seared the already-frozen\nscene into my camera. Although I believe some sights are better committed\nto memory than a snapshot, a good\nmemoir might come into handy when\nmy memory decides to fail me.\n*\n\u2018Crazy man\u2019 was crazy because of his\nfrantic salesmanship, not because he\nwas genuinely crazy. He was passionate\nfor his job, and loyalty to his employer\nand Thami\u2019s Restaurant (Bou Jeloud,\n50 Serrajine, The Medina). Come rain\nor come shine, he would wave around\nthe sheets detailing Lonely Planet\u2019s recommendation for the eatery, attracting\npatrons to the two tables it hosted.\nNot around this time though. It was\ntoo early for dinner.\nBut then, this boy with his green t-shirt emerged with a funny request.\n\u201cCan we take our food to our hotel\nterrace?\u201d\nHe felt no need for hesitation. Taking\norder for four portions of tagines, one\nof couscous, he whisked together all\ningredients in the undersized kitchen\nand distributed them to individual tag-ines, with the precision and haste he\nwould commit to any dish.\n\u201cPlease bring the tagine pots back\nafter you\u2019ve finished?\u201d He had to make\nsure. Any piece of the terracotta may\nbe worth more than his daily salary \u2012\nlosing one would mean financial disas-ter, let alone four. He could only wait,\ndistraught nevertheless; but he could\nonly wait.\nSoon enough, the teens had brought\nback the crockery with satisfaction\nsmeared across their lips.\nThat was exactly why \u2018crazy man\u2019 was\npassionate for his job.\n*\nFlipping through my guidebook, I\ncame across a piece of intriguing infor-mation: that F\u00e8s hosts the Festival of\nWorld Sacred Music every June, since\n1995. Approaching eight, marching\ndown Talaa Seghira with an entourage\nof seven (I found three more hitchhikers earlier during the day), I knew I was\non for a treat.\nIt was bound to be a very private\nconcert, minus the intimidation and\nplus the interaction, with some very\nspecial music indeed.\nKnowing that we would be disorien-tated in the dark, Lahlou came further\nup the Talaa to lead us into his sanc-tuary. Soon enough, room became an\nissue when Lahlou\u2019s friends arrived,\nand the crowdedness that generated\nawkwardness. Most of us fell short of\nwords.\nThe language barrier collapsed once\nthe music started to swing, and us\nrocking to its thunderous beats. The\nlongest night had begun, the room\nsmoke-filled and distorting before\nour eyes; I became, my intolerance of\nstereotypes aside, Lahlou\u2019s Jet Li for\nthe occasion, and laughed along to his\nplayfulness.\nIt certainly was a saga that I would\nnot want to end.\nThe Holy-water Man Portrait Lahlou Ahmed (left) and Me\nFrom left: Anna, Andrew, Kag & Me\nMan in a djellaba\n\n"

Florence\u2019s near\nbankruptcy caused by its wars with rival Italian cities reintroduced bonds,\nalmost as we know them today. The\nend of the Second World War saw substantially greater internationalism. The\nfiscal strains of the Vietnam War and\nJohnson\u2019s \u2018Great Society\u2019 led Nixon to\ndismantle Bretton-Woods, allowing\nthe foreign exchange market eventually to reach its current daily volume of\naround $4 trillion.\nThe recent, by some accounts cur-rent, financial crisis is on a par with\nsuch historical triggers. There is a noticeable shift in mainstream economic\nthinking towards progressivism and\nthere are strong sentiments against\nmany of the boom areas of the past\ndecade. These shifts will in turn affect the career opportunities of Imperial graduates who are looking to start\nwork in the finance sector.\nWe will be looking at three key areas\nthat we believe will see above average\ngrowth in job creation relative to the\nsector. Traditional distributed finance\nthat profits from managing the risks of\nputting short-term deposits into long-term investments looks set to remain\nstrong. At the same time, there is exciting growth in a host of new and resurgent unorthodox areas such as Venture\nCapital and peer-to-peer lending. This\nweek we will begin by discussing the\nopportunities and continuing difficulties present in the emerging markets\nof Asia.\nFirst off we can identify three important global trends that are likely\nto apply to Asian markets as much as\nany other. The most significant will be\nincreased government intervention,\nprobably meaning a plethora of new\nroles in public advisory and regulatory\nbodies. Hedging risks will also become\nmore popular, with hedge funds likely\nto regain strength, although more as\ninsurers than casinos. However, most\nwill have to reduce their fees as clients\nreconsider the value that their prudence adds. The loss of confidence in\nfinancial institutions will benefit advisory boutiques as clients seek their\nhelp navigating the rough waters.\nA trend more specific to emerging\nmarkets, particularly in Asia, will be\ntheir continued growth. They are likely\nto get out of the current troubles faster\nand rebound more convincingly than\nthe major developed economies. This\nwill continue the long-term rise of\ntheir private banking, wealth management \u2013 especially as relative domestic\nconfidence increases, and wholesale\nfinancial services.\nAs Asian economies begin to recover growth rates closer to what they\nenjoyed in the past, local banks look\nespecially well placed to benefit. They\nhave a newly found confidence relative\nto their developed world peers. Their\nlocal knowledge is now more prized,\nespecially given the increased popularity of smaller scale and more targeted lending. They will also benefit as\nAmerican and European governments\nattempt to force their bailed-out banks\nto invest locally. But when will they return to \u2018normal\u2019 growth?\nRecovery looks more imminent for\ndeveloping countries in general. With\nmany attempting to stimulate out of\ntheir woes, they will benefit from having by definition better opportunities\nfor infrastructure spending. Asian\neconomies have generally put together\nproportionately the most generous\nstimulus packages, and these are more\nlikely to work because their banks have\nfewer problems. Households also have\nsmaller debts, having rejected American consumers\u2019 economics of spend-ing, on long-term average, 110% of\nincome. This can also be said of firms\nand governments, meaning they are\nlikelier to spend new revenue. Nor\ndoes the continent\u2019s recovery from\nrecession depend on exports to developed countries: East Asia\u2019s current-ac-count surplus was smaller in 2001 than\nin 1998.\nOne of the most promising fields for\nfuture growth in Asia is Islamic finance.\nGlobally, the sector is worth over $600\nbillion, although some of this is little\nmore than clients asking western funds\nnot to invest their money in pork. It\nhas been booming throughout the\ndecade, and was accelerated by high oil\nprices. This growth enjoyed positive\nfeedback as the market infrastructure\nmatured rapidly. The financial crisis\nhas further boosted the popularity of a\nsystem favouring profits from sharing\nthe value created by investments over\nspeculative gains.\nOverall Asian economic growth is\nnot predicted to return to its recent\npeak of around 9%, as that depended\non a coincidence of several fortunate,\ninternational factors. But there is still\nsubstantial room for further expansion\nbacked up by fundamental strengths.\nTrend growth for the medium term is\npredicted to be three times that of developed economies. As financial institutions regain their role of driving this\ngrowth, their prospects in Asia look\ngood.\nfelix takes a look at promising career\nopportunities in Asia\u2019s emerging markets.\nBusiness Bulletin\nfelix takes a look at some of the stories from the past week.\nJapanese GDP contracts at 15.2%\nOver the January-March period Japans Gross Domestic Product shrank\nat its fastest pace since 1955. Over the\ncourse of the quarter the countries\nGDP fell by 4% and if the trend continued over the course of the year its\neconomy would shrink by 15.2%. This\nmarks the largest drop in Japans GDP\nsince it began compiling GDP statistics\nmore than 50 years ago. It is also marks\nthe fourth straight quarter of recession\nfor Japan, where GDP shrank at an annual rate of 12.1% between October\nand December.\nThe worlds second biggest economy\nshrank at a markedly faster pace than\nother world leaders. Over the last quarter the Euro-zone economies shrank by\nan average of 2.5%, the US shrank by\n1.6% and the UK shrank by 1.9%.\nOver the past two decades the Japanese economy has become extremely\ndependent on exporting gadgets and\ncars. Poor sales as a result of the credit\ncrunch have had an extreme effect on\nthe country with the Yen seeing large\ndevaluations as a result.\nPound strengthens against dollar\nAfter a recent low of $1.37 in early\nMarch the Pound has shown signs of\nregaining traction against the dollar.\nOver the past two months the pound\nhas shown relatively steady improvement against the dollar rising to $1.55.\nOver a similar period the pound has\nalso risen against the euro rising from\n\u20ac1.06 to \u20ac1.14.\nIn contrast the dollar has lost ground\nto most currencies, showing investors\nlack of faith.\nIMF commends Brownian recovery package\nThe governments recovery package\nhas been hailed as \u201cbold and wide ranging\u201d by the International Monetary\nFund with the plans \u201caggressive action\u201d\nlauded as having averted a crisis.\nHowever the IMF was still cautious\nabout the UK\u2019s longer term stating that\n\u201cIt remains to be seen whether the recent efforts to recapitalise the banks\nwill be sufficient to sustain credit provision at a level required for a robust\neconomic recovery.\u201d\nThe IMF also stuck to it\u2019s prediction\nand forecasted a decrease of 4.1% in\nthe UK\u2019s GDP noting that the UK is\nstill \u201csusceptible to potential shocks\u201d\nand \u201cunder stress\u201d. It further stated that\nit would like to see a reduction in tax\nrates, less government spending and a\nmore concise explanation of the governments plans.\nDomestically the Governments recovery plans have been less warmly\nreceived and opposition leaders have\nbeen quick to use the economy as a\ntalking point.\nOil Prices rise to $60\nAs supply concerns mounted following\ntwo fires in key US refineries, oil prices\nreached their highest price this year.\nAs recently as December crude oil cost\nas little as $33 but has risen over 50% in\nprice over the last six weeks.\nOil price rises have also been hailed\nas being the result of growing optimism in the world economic recovery with several sources claiming that\noil is echoing equity markets. Other\ncommentators remain cautious stating that oil price rises are the result of\nspeculation.\nSir Victor Blank Steps down\nSir Victor Blank, chairman of Lloyds\nBank is set to step down stating that\n\u201cthe right time for the Group to appoint a new chairman\u201d.

After the success of our maiden season, we knew it\nwould be a hard act to follow.\nMore than half the team were making debut performances, so there were\na few nerves rattling as we walked on\nto the field (some were just anticipating the cricket tea).\nAfter winning the toss, we elected to\nbat. Tara Laforce and Kushani Ediriwickrema opened the batting, having\nshown flare with their bats in the indoor season. However, we lost an early\nwicket in the second over and I was\ncalled to the crease. Kushani and I batted for a few overs until we had some\nunlikely guests \u2013 some men with cam-eras! The umpire was more perturbed\nthan us, and went to shoo them away\n\u2013 there was something a little weird\nabout taking random photos of women\nplaying cricket! After the commotion\ndied away, we lost a few quick wickets\nin succession. Some valuable periods at\nthe crease from Veena Surendrakumar,\nLouise Hirst and Sadaf Raza allowed\nus to maintain the run rate (aided by a\nnumber of wides along the way!)\nAt the 20-over mark, we had made\n90 but only had 2 wickets remaining.\nWith the overs running out, I decided\nto try and pick up the run rate. At 26\novers, our last remaining batswoman\nwalked out. This was Mithila Patkunan. I heard a shout from the Imperial girls from the boundary that I had\nto get 4 for my half-century. Mithila\nhit several awesome shots in support,\nand the in the next over I reached my\nhalf-century! In the next over, the final\nwicket fell and it was time for tea. We\nknew we had a good shot at winning,\nafter posting a score of 137. However,\nUCL were an unknown entity to us.\nAfter tea, we came out to bowl. Elsa\nButrous and Sian Fogden were the\nopening bowlers, both doing the team\nproud. Sian, consistent as ever, got 2\nwickets in her final 2 overs. We had\nsome excellent performances from\nKushani (in her first outdoor match\never) taking the key wicket of the star\nUCL batswoman who was on 22 and\nlooked to make a big score. The other\nkey wicket was taken by Aleeza Janmohamed, together with a great catch.\nUCL finished on 105 all out, leaving\nImperial the victors!!\nA great start to the season! If you\nwould like to learn how to play cricket\nor already know how and would like to\njoin in our success, please email Dharani Yerrakalva or Priya Shah on icwo-menscricket@googlemail.com\nDharani Yerrakalva\nWet and\nwild in\nTurkey\nWilliam Parry-Jones\nThe recession has hit Britain hard, the\npreviously rock-solid Pound taking\na beasting against other currencies.\nWith the exchange rate slipping on\nthe Dollar it was decided that Imperial\nWakeboarding club would have to look\naway from the previously standard\nOrlando Watersports Centre in order\nto deliver a trip with good value for\nmoney. Luckily for us, a brand new watersports complex had recently opened\nnear to the small city of Antalya in Turkey, and reports were trickling back\nthat the facilities and riding conditions\nwere world-class.\nSo it conspired that a group of seven\nmet at the Union on the last day of term\nin order to \u201ctake the edge off\u201d for the\nearly morning flight, this resulted in at\nleast six of us being completely mauled\nthroughout the boarding procedures.\nRespect has to be given to President\nJonners \u2018dub\u2019 Watkins for holding it\ntogether, ensuring that Thomas Cook\ndidn\u2019t get to fuck us on luggage allowance and that seven of us stepped off\nthe plane at Antalya.\nWe arrived at the Hip-Notics wake\npark at around 11am and with the\nmorning sun rising over the snow\ncapped mountains the first thing that\nstruck us was the beauty of the place.\nThere are three lakes centred around a\nlarge decked area that serves as a chill-ing/eating zone, and at the end of one\nof the lakes are several bungalows that\nallowed us to live right at the lakeside.\nThe owner of the complex explained\nthat for the next two days we would be\nthe only English speakers at the site,\nthis meant that we would have to get\nby on limited German and hand gestures which was initially worrying.\nThe day manager of the site however\nwas the single most legendary person\nI think any of us have met, nick-named\n\u2018Dave\u2019 due to his complicated Turkish name he ensured that every night\nwas heavy on outrageous antics and he\npicked up both fives and 21\u2019s quicker\nthan most English-speaking people\ncould manage. Dave also had a penchant for stacking all seven of us on\nhis quad bike and ragging it around the\ncomplex whilst completely smashed.\nNight time activities included GoKarting, Massages, and drinking the\nlocal spirit called Raki (Turkish for\nBull Semen). The potency of Raki was\nproved on the second night when Jak\nmanaged to fall off a wall whilst pissing rendering himself unconscious,\nnaturally Dave was on hand to stack\nhis corpse on the front of the quad and\nI\u2019m pretty sure there are meant to be 11 players in a cricket team\nCricket\nIC Women\u2019s 1st XI 137\nUCL Women\u2019s 1st XI 105\n\n"

This gave them an easy way to\ntrack how well the delivery system\nworked, by simply checking the level\nand location of fluorescence.\nThe results of these observations\nwere that the nanoparticles were successfully able to penetrate the cells\nbelow the surface of the vaginal wall,\nspread through the reproductive sys-tem, and remain effective for up to 14\ndays. Crucially, the mice did not show\nsigns of irritation.\nThe results indicate that this method\nof delivery could be used to produce\na cream, which is easy to apply, and\nwould prevent the virus spreading.\nHowever, the team have yet to test this\nmethod against an actual virus. Senior author E. Mark Salzman is hopeful\nthough, and is planning ahead. He said:\n\u201cour next step in research will be to test\nthis approach directly in disease models \u2013 for example in the HIV model\nmice.\u201d\nGerta Keller, a Princeton University ge-oscientist, has stirred controversy with\nher newest study published in The Journal of the Geological society of London\non the April 27th this year. Her studies challenge the popular theory that\nan asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs\nand she has compiled powerful new\nevidence asserting her position. Her\nresearch of rock formations in Mexico,\nIndia and the United states have led her\nto conclude that volcanoes, not a vast\nmeteorite, were the more likely culprits\nin the demise of Earth\u2019s giant reptiles.\nKeller has found \u2018aftermath\u2019 sediments that remained undisturbed and\nshowed signs of active life, with burrows formed by creatures colonizing\nthe ocean floor. This research quashes\nthe theory that a massive tsunami followed a meteorite impact. UnderstandWhat really killed off the\ndinosaurs?\ning what caused the dinosaurs to disappear is considered a great mystery,\ntheories which attempt to explain it\ninclude asteroid or comet impacts, vol-canoes, climate change, rising sea levels\nand supernova explosions.\nWhat scientist\u2019s do know is that\naround 65 million years ago some phenomenon triggered a mass extinction.\nThis event is what defines the boundary between the older Mesozoic Era\n(the age of the reptiles) and the modern Cenozoic Era (age of the mam-mals). Keller has amassed evidence of\nthe surrounding geological area around\nChicxulub (the crater formed by the\nmeteorite thought to have killed the\ndinosaurs) and concluded that the impact occurred 300,000 years before the\ngreat extinction.\nAdvocated of the Chicxulub impact\ntheory, believe that the impact crater\nand mass extinction event only appear\nfar apart in the sedimentary record\nbecause of earthquakes and tsunami\u2019s.\nKeller\u2019s research confirms that the\nsandstone complex that overlays the\nimpact layer was not deposited over\nhours or days by a tsunami but over a\nlong time period with no evidence of\nstructural disturbance.\nFossils of 52 species present in the\nsediments below the impact layer and\nfurther fossils above have lead Keller to\nsuggest that not a single species went\nextinct as a result of the Chicxulub im-pact. Keller believes that a massive volcanic eruption from the Deccan Traps\nin India may be responsible for the ex-tinction. Massive amounts of dust and\ngases could have blocked sunlight and\naltered the climate.\nShe regards her latest evidence as\nsufficiently compelling to allow her\nand her team to move on and investigate further the evidence for Deccan\nvolcanism as the root of the dinosaur\u2019s\nextinction.\nThe new evidence challenges the popular belief that these giants\nbecame extinct because of an asteroid impact\nEmma Stokes\nScience Correspondent\nForget about junk food and video\ngames \u2013 the cause of childhood obesity is unobservant mums.\nA new study has shown that babies\nget fat because they are overfed by\ntheir mothers, who just don\u2019t notice\nwhen baby has had enough.\nMothers who aren\u2019t as good at reading their children will keep feeding\nthem even when they show signs of being full, said the study, carried out at\nRutgers University in New Jersey.\nThe scientists said some mothers\nshowed \u201can unwillingness to slow the\npace of feeding or terminate the feeding\u201d even when their child indicated it\nwas satiated.\nThis continual overfeeding may be\n\u201coverriding the infant\u2019s ability to self-regulate its intake\u201d which means they\ndon\u2019t learn that enough is enough, and\nmay continue to gain weight when\nolder.\nThis new insight could help to cut\nthe childhood obesity epidemic. The\nstudy highlights the importance of better educating mothers on the best way\nto feed and understand their children.\nBut the scientists warn they face \u201ca\ndaunting challenge\u201d because mothers\nmight take their advice as \u201cmeddling\u201d,\n\u201cthreatening\u201d or even \u201can accusation of\npoor mothering\u201d.\nThe study, published in The Journal\nof Nutrition Education and Behaviour,\nwas carried out on 96 low-income\nmothers, all of whom were using for-Abigail Orr\nScience Correspondent\nExcessive Cola\nleads to paralysis\nCola soft drinks may soon carry health\nwarnings on their packaging if doctor\u2019s\nwarnings are listened to.\nA report in the International Journal of Clinical Practice suggests that\nexcessive drinking of cola drinks can\nlead to profound muscle paralysis.\nThis news comes after an Australian\nostrich farmer required emergency\ntreatment for lung paralysis after consuming between 4-10 litres of cola a\nday.\nOther cases highlighting the danger\nof excessive cola consumption have\nalso been reported.\nFor example, a pregnant woman\ncomplained of tiredness, appetite loss\nand persistent vomiting after drinking\nas much as 3 litres of cola daily for six\nyears.

Yet the\nMinistry of Defence claimed the culls\nwere carried out humanely. Kangaroos are tranquilised from a distance\nand then captured while sedated to\navoid stress and pain. The animals\nare then euthanized with a lethal\ninjection.\nSimilar efforts to manage kangaroos\nby culling failed last year when animal\nrights activists intervened and interrupted the cull.\nPlans are under way to interrupt this\nyear\u2019s cull as well. Bernard Brennan,\npresident of Canberra\u2019s Animal Liberation conservation group, said many\nprotesters from across the country\nwere going to take part in demonstra-tions. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to sit back and\nlet it happen,\u201d he said.\ndrinks cause potassium levels in the\nblood to fall dangerously low, leading to a medical condition known as\nhypokalaemia.\nDr Clifford Packer from the Louis\nStokes Cleveland VA Medical Centre\nin Ohio told the BBC News website:\n\u201cthere is very little doubt that tens of\nmillions of people in industrialised\ncountries drink at least 2-3 litres of\ncola per day.

A spokeswoman from the British Soft Drinks Association said they\nencouraged only moderate consumption of cola as part of a balanced diet\nand active lifestyle.\nmula feed exclusively. The team recorded the number of feeds per day,\nthe mother\u2019s BMI and the weight gain\nof the baby for the first year after birth,\nas well as the sensitivity of the mother\nto the child\u2019s signals.\nThe researchers said that the number\nof feeds per day was an \u201ceasy culprit on\nwhich to assign blame\u201d but that the\nonly variable that significantly affected\nthe weight of the child was how observant the mother was.\nof overweight and obese students fell\nfrom 13% to 9%, compared to the control group that saw an increase from\n11% to 13%. Other benefits were also\nobserved in the children: increased\nlung capacity, lower cholesterol levels\nand improved systolic blood pressure.\nDr Claudia Walther, one of the re-searchers, explains that children are\nmuch less active than their ancestors\nand that her team believed an increase\nin exercise could reduce the children\u2019s\nsusceptibility to cardiovascular disease\nlater in life.\nThe daily exercise they proposed\nincluded at least 15 minutes of endurance training, all under the supervision\nof teachers. \u201cThe teachers [made] sure\nthat the programme was followed\u201d, said\nDr Walther.\nHe also said that: \u201cEven from these\nfirst-year results we can say that regular physical activity has a significant\nbeneficial effect on body composition,\nexercise capacity and cardiovascular\nrisk markers in children.\u201d\nThe researchers hope that following\nthe children over the next 10-20 years\nwill give an idea of whether this new\nlifestyle will translate into health benefits later in life.\nWalther is hopeful that many schools\nwill realise the obvious benefits and\nthat daily exercise will soon be incorporated in many German schools. He\nsaid: \u201cIt\u2019s so easy, all it needs is a little\nmore time allocated to exercise les-sons.

The day was drawing to a\nclose, pre-drinks had been drunk and\nI made my way to Heaven. That\u2019s right,\nVice Magazine were having a party.\nAnd it was good.\nHipsters and people wearing those\ngeek-chic granny glasses danced until\ndawn, with big eyes and cans of Red\nStripe. The line-up was great. In the\nmain room we had Busy P, DJ Mehdi\nand Feadz making up the legendary\nEd Banger Records Trio \u2013 lucky lucky!\nThis invincible cross-genre Paris label\nis the home of Justice and Sebastian\nand these guys have been redefining\nFan Death, Filthy Dukes, Busy P\n,\nFeadz, and DJ Mehdi\nEd Banger and Vice @ Heaven\n3rd May\nAlex Ashford\nMusic Editor\nThe Art of the\nRemix\nI\nwas talking to someone the other day who mentioned that they\n\u201creally like that La Roux song,\nhow does it go, going in for the\nkill...?\u201d and I had to ask them if\nthey meant the original or the Skream\nremix, or the Foamo remix, or a different mix, and it occured to me that if\nthere is one defining thing about music\nat the moment, one thing that people\nmight look back on as the music of\nthe \u201cnoughties\u201d (I hate that word) it is\nremixes.\nRemixes of everything have sprung\nup as part of the internet\u2019s music\nblog culture, and have continuously\nbrought fresh takes on new songs for\nour short attention spans to enjoy.\nRemixes have lead to merging of different genres and exciting new things\nhave sprung up from them such as UK\nfunky house, a merging of funky house\nand grime, bashment, a merging of UK\nfunky house and Jamaican dancehall,\nand no doubt others I am unaware of.\nSo heres a rough guide to some of\nthe main artisans of the remix, the DJs,\nartists and producers who have turned\ntheir hands to turning round songs\nand have gained appriciation across\nthe music \u201cblogosphere\u201d (I hate that\nword too).\nFrench producer Fred Falke has\nremixed almost every mp3 someone\nhas ever posted online, including a recent remix of Grizzly Bear\u2019s track \u201ctwo\nweeks\u201d which is 7 minutes 45 seconds\nof pure disco electro happiness. He\u2019s\neven remixed a U2 song, and when you\nget to the point where you have to look\nto U2 for songs, you have to wonder if\nyou have taken his remix addiction one\nstep too far.\nDiplo is a veteran of the mix, having remixed over thirty songs since he\nstarted back in 2005 and has remixed\nartists from The Beatles to Three 6\nMafia. I reccomment his mix of the\nMajor Lazer song \u201chold the line\u201d.\nBy contrast, Classixx (the Xs are for\nyour googling ease) are relatively new\nto the game, but have made my favourite remix of the day: Phoenix\u2019s \u201clisztomania\u201d as well as a bunch of others.\nThey haven\u2019t even put out any of their\nown records yet, though I\u2019ve read we\ncan expect their EP next year.\nLondon\u2019s most ubiquitous electro DJ,\nErol Alkan is no stranger to remixing either. Though he hasn\u2019t done as\nmuch as Diplo, he has used his signature remixing to popularize tracks like\nDance Area\u2019s \u201cAA247\u201d.\nTaking a step back from such abrasive club electro, artists like the DJ duo\nAeroplane are pretty much known\nexclusively for their melodic laid back\ndisco remixes such as their sublime\ntake on the already much-remixed\n\u201cParis\u201d by Friendly Fires.\nFor something a bit more intellec-tual, have a listen to some of the many\nremixes by Swedish ambient artist Johan Agebj\u00f6rn, such as Glass Candy\u2019s\n\u201cthe Chameleon\u201d. I\u2019ve mentioned only\na tiny electro-centric handful of the\nmany, many remixes out there, so get\nonline and find some for yourself.\nThe Papas of nu-metal are\nback again\nVictoria Brzezinski\nWhat we think is sounding sharp or falling flat\nEminem, once upon a\ntime you were funny...\nthose days are clearly gone\nBonkers was pretty\ngood but butterfly ...\nehh...\nYeah Yeah Yeah\nyeah yeah yeah\nyeah yeah yeahs!\nFunky House\nis cheesy but\nit\u2019s the hottest\nthing on the\ndance floor\nright now\nPapa Roach\n@ Kentish Town Forum\n17th April\nDuncan Casey\nAlthough the last time Papa Roach\nplayed in the UK was the better part\nof ten years ago, some things haven\u2019t\nchanged much. The place was packed\nto the rafters with black-outfitted teenage boys wearing too much eye-liner,\nalthough the scene was ruined somewhat by the collection of bemused\nmiddle-aged mums who\u2019d brought\nthem, drinking G&T and discussing\nEastenders at the back.\nA few things have changed since we\nlast saw the band, though. Nu-metal\nis, it seems, finally dead, although its\nreplacement seems to owe more to\nBon Jovi than anything more recent\nand disappointingly the band\u2019s sound\nhas gone down the same route as that\nof Linkin Park and the Lostprophets. Some of the band\u2019s recent material (from their new album Metamorphosis) seemed a bit rockier, but the\nmajority of the gig was more power\nballad than the \u2018proper\u2019 rock that the\nStone Gods or the Answer produce so\nreliably.\nStill, the live show was fun \u2013 frontman Jacoby Shaddix fancies himself as\na kind of emo Freddy Mercury, posing and working the adoring crowd,\nwho responded with the first half-way\ndecent mosh pits I\u2019ve seen in months.\nThe new drummer, Tony Palermo (ex\nof Unwritten Law), was also a minor\nrevelation, finding some drive and aggression in some otherwise fairly bland\nsongs. The guitarists weren\u2019t taxed too\nmuch \u2013 one thing that has carried over\nfrom the old nu-metal albums is the\nstaccato, minimalist riff style, although\nthis did mean that the axe-men had\nplenty of time to pull rock poses and\npoint into the crowd, Spinal Tap style.\nSure, it was all a bit panto, but there\u2019s\nspace in rock and roll for that, surely.\nAs always, it was worth not paying\ntoo much attention to the lyrics \u2013 let\u2019s\nbe honest, most of the songs are a bit\npaint-by-numbers, and the recent single Hollywood Whore is no real excep-tion, an irony-free song by a Jack-Daniels-and-cocaine pop-rock band about\nhow shallow people are on the L.A.\nparty circuit.\nThe band are a lot better live than\non CD, though, and it\u2019s worth trying to\ncatch them at Download if you\u2019re going to spend any time rocking out post-exams this summer.\n23\nFriday 22 May 2009 felix\nMusic\nmusic.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nThe foxes are truly out the bag\nI would be most surprised if over the\nlast six months that every individual\nwith the slightest appreciation of their\nsurroundings had not somehow been\nmade aware of the existence of a band\nby the name of the Fleet Foxes, be it\novertly, through large posters on the\ntube emphatically stating \u2018album of the\nyear\u2019 with the rather surreal medieval\nartwork or via more discreet subliminal messaging emerging from my desperate attempts to preach the gospel\nregarding this blissful band.\nEither way, if you have yet to have\nbeen made aware of the Fleet Foxes\nI hope in the ensuing paragraphs my\nchildlike enthusiasm will convey some\ndescription.\nFirst surfacing to a wider audience\namidst uncontrollable excitement in\nthe aftermath of the 2008 SXSW festival it seems that this Seattle based folk-rock collective have slowly emerged\nfrom relative unknowns to being wildly acknowledged as the torch bearers\nfor ambient music that echoes a purer\nform of yesteryear (with influences of\nNeil Young, The Beach Boys and Harry Nilson) whilst containing a powerful medieval element.\nThis evening, the Fleet Foxes are\nrounding of 3 sold-out nights at the\nRoundhouse as a final swansong to an\nincredibly successful past 18 months.\nOpening with the first song of their\nsecond EP - \u2018Sun Giant\u2019, front man\nRobin Pecknold officially ends the\ndark and dismal days of winter with\na stunning vocal harmony with vivid\nreferences, \u2018What a life I lead in the\nsun, what a life I lead in the spring\u2019,\ncreating inviting images of the wind,\nsea and sun.\nThe first 60 seconds are wonderful as Pecknold along with bassist\nChristian Bargo, Casey Westcott on\nthe keyboard and drummer Josh Tillman create a heavenly vocal harmony\nthat captivates the audience from the\nonset.\nThe transition to \u2018Drops in the River\u2019 is seamless as my personal favourite song is delivered with a delicacy\nthat touches on perfection. A subtle\nchord progression begins this track\nas Pecknold continues with his serene\nimagery, \u2018On the shore, speak to the\nocean and receive silence,\u2019 the song\nslowly builds and builds to a climax as\nthe wild imagery meets what appears\nto be bitter memories. I don\u2019t know\nwhether to laugh or cry. The melody\nis heavenly, the notion of being alone\nsurrounding by all things organic pure\nis so appealing but the underlying release of a passed love is rather hard to\nstomach. Maybe I am just a wet blanket but this for me is what makes this\nband so interesting, the music is so\npure but there is this underlying sinister element that consistently lurks in\nPecknold\u2019s lyrics.\nThe 2,000 packed into the roundhouse are then treated to some of the\nmost infectious and peaceful songs\nas \u2018English Summer House\u2019, \u2018White\nWinter Hymnal\u2019 and \u2018Ragged Wood\u2019\nare delivered with faultless melody.\nThe backing vocals are so tight and\nallow Pecknold to verge into emotive\ncries that make for some captivating\nmoments. It is very refreshing that\nwhilst the band produces evocative in-strumentals, the vocal harmonies are\ngiven prominence with the opening of\n\u2018Ragged Wood\u2019 being an excellent example of this wonderful human sound.\nFollowing from the delightful melody of the previous songs the set is laid\nbare as Pecknold is left alone on stage\nand given the space of the Roundhouse to demonstrate his harmonic\nvoice that contains deep depths of\nsoul. \u2018Oliver James\u2019 brings all members\nof the audience into a collective awe as\nthe narrative of young Mr. James being\nbrought home from the rain is giving\na haunting resonance by Pecknold\u2019s\nvoice. This song again shows the intriguing contrast between enchanting\nsound and more lurid sentiment, \u2018The\nsound of ancient voices ringing soft\nupon your ear\u2019 as death is again fused\nwith nature in an elegant fashion.\nThe rest of the band returns to deliver the remainder of the first part\nof the set and execute fan favourite\n\u2018Mykonos\u2019 to rapturous applause. This\nepic song of redemption and friendship with yet more powerful imagery,\n\u2018and you will go to Mykonos with a\nvision of a gentle coast and a sun to\nmaybe dissipate shadows of the mess\nyou made\u2019.\nPecknold is again given the undivided attention of the Roundhouse\nas he returns unaccompanied by the\nremainder of the band for the encore.\nHe is also astoundingly unaccompanied by a microphone and amps as he\nsteps right to edge of stage for a cover\nof a traditional American folk song by\nthe name of \u2018Katie Cruel\u2019. The audience is deathly silent as this powerful\ntale of a prostitute from the 1700s as\nnothing but Pecknold\u2019s voice echoes in\nthe compact dome of the Roundhouse.\nThis is followed by Tiger Mountain\nPeasant Song before whole band join\nHow folky is this guy? Jesus beard, acoustic guitar, brown grandad cardie, plaid shirt...\nin unison for the delightful closer Blue\nRidge Mountains.\nThe sound throughout the whole\ngig is excellent and the venue provides\nquite possibly the optimum space, size\nand all important acoustics for these\nwondrous musicians.\nDespite this, Pecknold does express\na proposal to use the distinctive shape\nof the Roundhouse for a planetarium.\nI for one can see merit in such a suggestion but only providing they come\nback soon, not only for a little bit of\nstar gazing action but some awe-in-spiring performances of tranquil, intriguing and beautiful music.\nVictoria Brzezinski\nFleet Foxes\n@ The Roundhouse\n24th February\nA thousand lucky people managed\nto beg, borrow and steal tickets to\ntonights sold out show at the Scala\nin Kings Cross. It was a rare intimate occasion to see a band of\nsuch monumental proportions.\nI think it was fair to say, the\nstart of tonights set caught most\npeople completely off guard.\nThe drone of \u2018She is not Alone,\u2019\na song from the bands infancy,\nwas a curious choice to begin\nwith, on account of its slow\nrhythmic pace and monotonic melody. It was appreciated nonetheless,\nbut the room really\nstarted to ignite when\nthe pounding drums\nerupt underneath the\nopening harmonics to\n\u2018bull in the heather\u2019.\nThe irony of the\nChris Walmsley\nSonic Youth\n@ The Scala\n27th April\nthe sound of our dance floors.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a noise competition,\u201d laughs Busy P, a.k.a. Pedro\nWinter, the founder of Ed Banger\nRecords and Daft Punk\u2019s manager.\n\u201cBut, definitely, it\u2019s something we play\nwith. We\u2019re making distortion musical.\nWe\u2019re making noise funky.\u201d\nDance music suffered corporate\nstrangulation in the Nineties and it\u2019s\nlabels like Ed Banger which have inspired a nouveau cavalier underground\nclub culture. Their Gallic beats were\nthe main attraction of the night and\nthey definitely didn\u2019t disappoint.\nSo Busy P is basically the Godfather\nof French electro [Ed note: Daft Punk?]\nand DJ Mehdi\u2019s rap music background\nhas turned him into one of the French\nunderground hip hop scene\u2019s premier\nproducers. Feadz is Fabien Pianta. He\u2019s\nanother child of hip hop and is a tal-ented, exciting DJ known for especially\nfor his collaborations with Uffie.\nWe also had some great live sets\nfrom the decadent dancepop of Filthy\nDukes (\u201celectroacidhousenuravetwisteddiscopunkfunk\u201d, according to Polydor) and electrodisco duo Fan Death.\nThese two girls had sequins and stage\npresence in bucket loads. Check out\nVeronica\u2019s Veil on YouTube for a taste\nof their take on Eighties fantasy synth-pop. They say they make music recalling the greatest era of electronic pop;\nthink Depeche Mode, New Order, Human League, Soft Cell. . .\nThe niggle of the night was the extortionate \u2018cigarette wristband\u2019; if you got\nthe jitters for a ciggy or some sweat-free air, you had to pay a quid to go out\nand get back in again. And \u00a34.40 for a\ncan of beer was pretty steep.\nAside from that, my night in Heaven\nwas heavenly. \u201cFrench electro, upfront\ntech house, fidgety business spliced\nwith hip hop and rudeness\u201d. You just\ncan\u2019t go wrong with that. I\u2019m making\nit a habit that I stay out really ridiculously late every Bank Holiday.\nSonic Youth blast out the tunes at Scala\nband\u2019s name has been well pointed out\nbefore, with Kim Gordon for one being\n56 years \u2018young\u2019 but any petty ridicule\nwas soon rendered obsolete. This is a\ngroup of people who are still effortlessly cool, and unrelenting in their\npassion to perform. It\u2019s fantastic to see,\nLee Ranaldo\u2019s silver barnet aside, the\nband looking like I would have imagined them in 1989. \u2018The Sprawl\u2019 and\n\u2018Cross the Breeze\u2019 from the epic \u2018Daydream Nation,\u2019 are delivered with such\nferocity that unlike so many bands who\nresist hiatus, you don\u2019t wish you could\nbuy that time machine to go back\ntwenty years.\n2009 sees the release of yet another\nalbum \u2018The Eternal\u2019 and the new songs\nplayed tonight fitted in well, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019ve got any intention of resting on their laurels soon.\nThe new seemed a logical progression from the much acclaimed \u2018Rather\nRipped\u2019 of three years previous, maintaining a feel of strong melodic importance overlaid with the trademark SY\nfrantic mess of noise, although never\nfelt to be simply covering old ground.\nTwo encores followed. Ending with\nthe defiant \u2018Kool Thing\u2019 was sublime,\nalthough my personal favourite of the\nset was \u2018Schizophrenia\u2019. The girl really doesn\u2019t look comfortable stuck between those guys\nFlat Sharp\n\n"

Tech blogs, forums and Twitter\nare flooded with spec lists, supposedly leaked photos and iPhone-vs.-Pre\npolls, while Windows Mobile stirs up\nlittle interest with their forthcoming\nrelease.\nHaving been an iPhone (2G) user\nfor more than a year now I must say I\nam very impressed with Apple\u2019s little\ngem, but the limitations still annoy me\nevery now and then. This obviously includes the lack of fast data connection\nand GPS which are available on the 3G\nmodel, but I have more on my list: no\nvideo recording, crap camera quality,\nno Bluetooth file transfer, no A2DP\n(Bluetooth stereo audio), and - worst\nof all - no FM radio (podcasts just can\u2019t\nreplace live programmes).\nIronically, all the above problems do\nno exist in most other smartphones,\nespecially the latest ones from HTC,\nwhich is why I decided to give the HTC\nTouch HD a go a few months back:\nthe screen was great (despite one dead\nspot), loved the removable battery,\ngood camera quality, enjoyed the FM\nradio and GPS. Sadly, the disappointing video playback performance alone\nwas bad enough to force me back to\nthe iPhone again.\nThis is no iPhone fanboyism. I had\nbeen an HTC user for at least five\nyears, ranging from the very first xda\nto the xda Exec. In between I tried a\nSymbian phone (the Sendo X) once\nbut was instantly put off by the sluggish performance, and there had been\nlittle improvement on the Symbian OS\nsince then. I was also a Sony Ericsson\nuser for a little while when my budget\nwas low, but was surprised by the large\nuser group who offered a range of apps\nfor the feature-phone platform (I got\na Bluetooth cursor remote for Windows!). Strangely, I have yet to try a\nBlackberry and an Android phone, but\nthey seem to be still weak on the multimedia front so I\u2019m not sure if I want to\ntake the risk on these alien platforms\njust yet. Hopefully their performances\nwill have improved dramatically by the\nbeginning of summer.\nOf course, the big question is will the\nPalm Pre be better than the iPhone?\nFrom what I have seen so far it is very\npromising: not only does it have a mul-ti-touch screen (only five announced\nphones are known to have one), but it\ncan also multitask, has a camera with\nbuilt-in flash, and has a slide-down\nQWERTY keyboard which some\nmight prefer to the virtual keyboard.\nThe Pre\u2019s WebOS is nicely designed,\nespecially the calendar app which can\ncompress the free time to let you view\njust the appointments, as well as the\nUniversal Search function which lets\nyou start searching (contacts, apps, in\nGoogle, in Google Maps or in Wikipedia) by just typing at the home screen,\nand you can also pull up a shortcut bar\nby dragging your finger from the bezel\nto the screen. There is also a built-in\nAmazon MP3 Store app, similar to\nthe iTunes app on the iPhone but the\ntracks are cheaper. All sounds good so\nfar, but it will still depend on how well\nit will do with video files.\nWhat is certain is that I will definitely be replacing my iPhone once I\nget my summer job money, and as you\ncan see I will be spoiled by the many\nchoices. Putting aside the different\ntypes of platforms, I am simply looking\nfor a phone of good build quality (e.g.\nby HTC) and has the many features\nthat I mentioned earlier plus a smooth\nuser experience. Sadly, I have yet to see\none device that has it all. Perhaps the\nPre will be my saviour? Or maybe a future Android phone? Do send in your\nthoughts via Twitter (@richardlai).\nMy next\nsmartphone\nCity of Technophilia\nRichard Lai talks about his favourite kind of day in Hong Kong\nE\nvery time I go back to Hong\nKong, the first thing I would\ndo usually involve pigging\nout on the local snacks\n(custard tarts, cheung fan,\nfish balls, etc.) and visiting the gadget\nshops. For the latter you are probably\nimagining me wandering around a\nquiet, badly managed computer store\n(need I mention any names?). Thankfully, Hong Kong is nothing like that.\nAs a small city of some seven million\npeople, Hong Kong doesn\u2019t do many\nwarehouse-type stores like we do in\nthe UK, but they do have a couple of\ndistricts dedicated to consumer elec-tronics. Ask any locals and they would\nusually point you to Sham Shui Po for\ncomputer products and second hand\nmobile phones, and Mong Kok (feel\nfree to giggle, and there\u2019s also a Shatin\nwhile you\u2019re at it) for a greater range\nof gadgets such as cameras, MP3 players and TVs. Even a good travel guide\nwould mention these two attractions,\nespecially with Mong Kok holding the\nworld record for population density.\nOf course, the fact that these two districts can be turned into technophilic\nhangouts can only mean one thing:\nHongkongers totally love their gadg-ets, so much that what seems to be an\nobsession in the foreign eye is just the\nnorm in this small metropolis. Geeks\nlike myself wouldn\u2019t feel the least bit\nof alienation when stood in the streets\nfull of other local technophiles.\nWhat keeps this bizarre phenomenon ticking lies in the characteristics\nof the two districts: Sham Shui Po and\nMong Kok house the latest technologies in the city, yet ironically they also\nsuffer from the worst urban decay in\nHong Kong. For instance, take a stroll\nalong Sham Shui Po\u2019s Apliu Street on\na weekday afternoon, and you should\nsee many pensioners out of their sev-enty-year-old buildings, discussing the\nlatest features on mobile phones while\nswapping for a different phone at the\nsecond hand shops (at a small charge,\nof course). Cross the main road and\nyou would also see the occasional mid-dle-aged men checking out the laptops\nat the computer shopping centres.\nOn the other end of the age spec-trum, a great part of Hong Kong\nteenagers are known for their obsession with video games. The modern\nhip nickname for Hong Kong male\ngeeks is \u201ctrain boy\u201d (\u96fb\u8eca\u7537), same as\nthe Japanese book title in which the\nlead character has a great passion for\nmanga and computer games, yet he\nis inexperienced in socialising with\nwomen. Luckily, in recent years girls\nin Hong Kong are also becoming more\ntech-savvy, and some do visit electronic stores without the assistance of\na male companion - a big contrast to\nthe sausage fest ten years ago. There is\nno doubt that we owe the Nintendo DS\nand Wii for the improved gender ratio,\nbut in the computer market consumers\njust generally seem to be more confident than ever, probably to do with the\nincreasing popularity with the Hong\nKong online forums where members\nexchange tips on buying computers.\nDespite the rapidly increasing user\nbase, Hong Kong\u2019s actual gadget retailing space has not extended much\nbeyond Sham Shui Po and Mong Kok\nover the last ten years. For the former\nonly one of its landmark computer centres has had a recent small extension\nsince its grand opening three decades\nago, and the latter still relies on just Sai\nYong Choi Street and Mong Kok Computer Centre as its gadget hub.\nHowever, what has increased is the\nsize and number of computer expos\neach year, upsetting the large number\nof small shops. I went to the expo any-way, only to be disappointed by the\nlack of discounts and excitement. This\njust shows that Hong Kong needs little\naddition to its already fantastic gadget\nhaven.\nAs you can see, Hong Kong has a lot\nto offer on both the old and the new,\nso do visit before you run out of time!\nComputer shopping centres are dotted across Sham Shui Po district.\nTry-before-buy at a second-hand mobile phone stall. Gadgets are displayed in the style of a wet market.\n\u201cGeeks like\nmyself wouldn\u2019t\nfeel the least bit\nof alienation\u201d\nWin a CigStar!\nNow that you have read about CigStar\u2019s electronic cigarette, why\nnot try it yourself? felix is giving away a full unit (including the\ncharger, worth \u00a329) to a lucky reader, and all you will need to get\nare the highly affordable cartridges from CigStar.co.uk, and then\nlet the puffing begin (on campus, that is!)!\nTo enter the prize draw, simply sign\nup for a Twitter account and tweet the\nfollowing message with your name:\nCompetition closes at 9pm on Wednesday 27th\nMay 2009.

The\ndifficulty is compounded when the\npeas in question are on a plane hovering somewhere over the continent and\nthe plate seems eager to make landfall\na few precious seconds before the table\ndoes.\nThe herculean labour of consuming\nthis notoriously tricky foodstuff without causing yourself too great an embarrassment is not made easier when\nyour dinner has become a spectator\nsport. On whatever criteria the judges\nwould have awarded marks, however,\nmy neighbour would doubtlessly have\nwon. I have never before seen anyone\ndip pitta bread in tehina while wearing\ncufflinks, and I couldn\u2019t help but feel\nprivileged to have a front row seat at a\ndemonstration of such showmanship\nand legerdemain.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked suddenly, causing me\nto drop half my rice onto my lap. \u201cWhy\nare you flying?\u201d\n\u201cMy sister\u2019s getting married tomorrow,\u201d I replied, hastily brandishing my\nfork as I knocked over a glass of coke.\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said icily, handing me a\nnapkin while he brushed grains of rice\noff his shirt. \u201cWell. I hope you have a\nnice time.\u201d He replaced his earphones\nand meaningfully shot his cuffs.\nI was going abroad for literally 48\nhours in order to take a break from my\nrevision and to hold up one of the four\ncorners of my sister\u2019s chuppah - the\ntraditional Jewish bridal canopy. It\u2019s\nnot that they couldn\u2019t get a pole, you\nunderstand, the couple merely thought,\nafter careful consideration, that I might\nbe more decorative. And cheaper than\nimporting foreign labour. I jest, I jest,\nfear not. The only reason I give myself\nlicense to indulge in such a hoary old\njoke (that I wouldn\u2019t normally touch\nwith Josef \u2018Stretch\u2019 Pulaski - a ten-foot\npole) is that it serves as a neat segue to\nthe topic of my family. A family which,\nit goes without saying, is bursting at the\nseam with Poles.\nThe subtle socio-political and econo-geographical intrigues that characterise my family will be grist for a different\nmill. What I feel needs to be clarified,\nhowever, is that my family tree now\nclosely resembles Ficus aurea, the rainforest parasite whose tendrils envelop\nthe loose branches of neighbouring\nplants. Whereas most families take\npride in the vertical majesty of their\ngenealogies, we, like most Jews, glory\nin our family\u2019s lateral spread. The sheer\nchaos makes any attempt to distinguish\nblood relatives utterly meaningless.\nAnyone who has ever been close to the\nfamily has been swallowed into it, and\nthat goes for ex-husbands, step-chil-dren, friends, colleagues and in-laws.\nAll of which mean that last Friday,\nthe family tree was about to acquire a\nnew graft. My sister\u2019s newly-acquired\nhusband is a string theorist and physics professor at Tel Aviv university. The\nfact that I myself am studying physics is\nno coincidence, as it was my decision\nto come here that got my sister chatting to members of the physics faculty\nat Tel Aviv. It was while engaging with\nthis rarefied bunch that she became engaged to a bright young physicist and\ntennis enthusaist.\nWhile it\u2019s fantastic to have a professional physicist in your family (espe-cially come exam time), there are certain unavoidable drawbacks. To name\none, it makes any escape from physics\nimpossible, even at the supposedly safe\nhaven of my sister\u2019s wedding.\n\u201cAh! You must be Gilead!\u201d cried a\nbalding man with a large cowboy hat\nas he crossed the garden where the reception was being held. His profession\ncouldn\u2019t have been more obvious if he\u2019d\ntattooed \u00d7E=-\u2202B/\u2202t on his forearm.\n\u201cI hear you\u2019re doing physics at Imperial\u201d he said, motioning to his colleagues\nwith a peremptory gesture. I nodded\nnervously as the swarm converged.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some very good people at\nImperial\u201d he announced.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d echoed an older woman\nwith a thick Polish accent.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name - Zulotkin?\u201d\n\u201cTcherneyev,\u201d she prompted.\n\u201cAh yes, excellent theorist. You know\nhim?\u201d I quietly shook my head as I\nsipped from my glass of lemonade. Silence. He cleared his throat. It seemed\nto take forever. I flicked my eyes hopefully up at the sky. My prayers were\nsoon answered as the wedding plan-ner, informal-ceremony-conductor and\ngood friend of my sister called me to\nhold up the chuppah.\nAs I stood under the canopy with the\nparents and assorted siblings, I joined\nthe seventy or so guests in smiling uncontrollably as my sister permanently\npledged her troth to a physicist.\n\u201cWe vow to cherish and protect,\u201d they\nintoned in Hebrew, \u201cto love and honour\neach other. We thank God for his blessings and you for yours.\u201d I wiped a silent\ntear as they added the traditional coda:\n\u201cmay the force be with you.\u201d Yes, my sister really was marrying a physicist.\nI\nt began in my childhood.\nAmongst the toys and the games\nand the cartoons, there were two\nfigures that stood out. Two pinnacles of coolness. I am of course\nspeaking about James Bond and Indiana Jones. I couldn\u2019t have picked more\npolar opposites in facial if I had tried.\nJames Bond, the quintessential English spy. On the silver screen, he was\nsmart and suave, saving the world with\nan immaculate suit and a license to kill.\nAnd he was always clean-shaven \u2013 that\nwas a must. After all, could you really\ntrust the defence of the realm to someone that couldn\u2019t take care of their facial follicles? (The answer is no.)\nAnd then you have Indiana Jones \u2013\nJonesy, Junior, Dr. Jones, call him what\nyou like. He was a swashbuckling archaeologist with a wide-brimmed hat\nand bull-whip \u2013 the stuff young boys\u2019\ndreams are made of. And his beard \u2013\nthe stubble you can light matches off\n\u2013 was part of the appeal.\nBond and Jones \u2013 the two greatest\nheroes in a young boy\u2019s mind. Both\nconstantly jet off to exotic locales, both\nmix it up mediaeval with the bad guys,\nboth get the girl (Or sometimes, girls).\nMany a Saturday afternoon was spent\npretending I was one or the other, reenacting their adventures or creating\nmy own. Ah, the wonders of the imagi-nation! But what does this have to with\nbeards? Trust me, I\u2019m getting there.\nFast-forward a few years to the difficult adolescent period and I begin to\nsprout my own soup-strainer. Admittedly, it was nothing more than peach-fuzz to begin with but I grew, and my\nbeard grew with me. It was something\nI could take pride in. But I was eventually faced with a conundrum. I had\noccasionally experimented with the\ncontents of my father\u2019s shaving cabinet\n\u2013 just to keep it in shape \u2013 but with the\nprospect to shaving routinely, a choice\npresented itself to me.\nTo beard or not to beard? Not even\nHamlet could resolve this.\nIt had boiled down to who I\u2019d rather\nemulate. 007, with his well-defined\nnaked chin, or Henry Jones, Jr., with\nhis daringly unkempt cheeks. As I\u2019ve\nalready shown, both men are clearly\nwinners. Travel, adventure, and girls\n\u2013 three things which I yearned for\nin my youth. (In fact, I still yearn for\nthem \u2013 but the proportions have now\nchanged). By a whisker, Indiana Jones\nwon over. Perhaps it was the appeal to\na more lax regimen. Maybe it was the\nassociation with hunting Nazis (I remain rather ambivalent to Simon Wiesenthal\u2019s moustache). But there was no\ndenying the fact that while Bond was\nsmooth, Jones was rugged.\nSo I proceeded to let my beard grow\nas nature intended, intermittently\ntrimming when birds began to nest\nin the sideburns. I was thoroughly\npleased with my rugged appearance,\nknowing that it would be an instant hit\nwith the \u201cladies\u201d. I reached the conclusion \u201cGirls like rugged stubble\u201d without\nconsulting the dictionary, or anyone of\nthe female population. After all, I was\nfifteen. I clearly knew all there was to\nbe known about the rules of attraction.\nA rugged appearance involves, as\nwell as the obligatory beard, a touch\nof the wild, a body chiselled by work,\nand a faintly misogynistic smile. Unfortunately, I forgot to take these\ninto account. I thought that my stunning teenage terminal hairs would be\nenough by itself. How wrong I was.\nTurns out that a lanky youth in a raincoat is not what turns girls on.\nOnly after several rejections and one\nattempt to hunt me for sport (Don\u2019t\nask) did I slowly begin to revise my\noriginal assumption. I looked around\nme and the only other be-stubbled\ngent around me was my father, and\nthe only woman he ever pulled was my\nmother (Not that I have a right to com-plain). Horrified at becoming the en-emy, I dispensed with the razor blade\nand tore the excess hair from my face\nwith my bare hands. Fear makes us do\nvery stupid things.\nSo here I am now at Imperial. I have\nforsaken the hedonistic hirsutism of\nmy younger days. My shadow rarely\nlast longer than a few days now but I\nstill gaze wistfully at the figure in the\nmirror, idly dreaming of finding the\nArk of the Covenant hidden in the\nlabyrinthine passages of Central Library. My hand on the razor falters and\nI wonder whether I can pull off \u201cthat\u201d\nlook this time. That\u2019s when the words\nof my friend (Who is of the feminine\npersuasion) come back to me. \u201cOh, no.\nBeards are itchy; I\u2019d never kiss a guy\nwith a beard.\u201d\nI drop the razor...and rip the bastards\nout instead.\nFor Rhys Davies, beards are a prickly issue.\n\u201cOnly after\nseveral rejections\nand one attempt\nto hunt me\nfor sport, did I\nslowly change\nmy mind\u201d\nGilead Amit\u2019s brother-in-law\u2019s a physicist.

It may just have something to do with the\ndreams, ideas and ambition of Rob and Josie da Bank. With an electrifying line up, and huge names the promising set will be accompanied\nby amazingly fun experience. With many side events such as \u201cthe Bollywood Cocktail Bar, fancy dress en mass and even a Hidden Disco\u201d\nBestival has been around since 2004, and every year has produced\nsuperb lineup to make even the biggest festivals jealous.

Well as you can see from the huge line up, there are so\nmany great bands. One could just put the headliners up, and that would be enough to warrant the\n\u00a3150 price tag for the festival. So here it is:\nMassive Attack / Kraftwerk / Elbow\nMGMT / Seasick Steve / Fleet Foxes\nKlaxons / Bat For Lashes / Lily Allen\nSoulwax / Doves / 2manydjs\nHowever there are so many acts, it won\u2019t be possible to see them all.

Now\nIf I had another page I would list everyone\u2019s opinions, but right now, I\u2019m going to list\nmine.

A meat variant of\nthe famous French dish Ratatouille,\n\u2018Rat-au-Beit\u2019 will be hitting the Union\nmenus from next week at the credit\ncrunch busting price of \u00a31.95.\nAfonso Campos, our very own Food\nEditor, has had the privilege of a sneak\npreview. He commented that \u201cthe\ndish had as much flavour and texture\nas most Union food\u201d but said that the\nmeat was certainly very fresh.\nHangman\u2019s investigative team (teat)\ninterviewed Union President Jenny\nMorgan who refused to reveal the type\nof meat used in the new dish, referring\nus to her comments on the banana\nstory, see right.\nWe sent our Japanese Private Eye...\n(you figure it out, we don\u2019t want to get\nsued) into the Union kitchens in an attempt to discover the meat used in the\nmeal but he found nothing except a\nlot of cheese, rat traps and every episode of Biker Mice from Mars on VHS.\nWith Hangman\u2019s team of eggheads\n(dickheads) unable to put two and two\ntogether, it seems that the secret meat\nwill remain secret.\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re just glad that\nwe can leave our cheese in the Quad\nwithout fear.\nThe kitchen staff\u2019s high-tech method of catching lunch for everyone\nI\nn a daring daylight robbery, a\nperson (or persons) has stolen\nImperial\u2019s entire supply of Fairtrade bananas. The fate of the\nbananas is as yet unknown but\na note demanding \u201c\u00a580,000\u201d was left\nat the scene of the crime. It is believed\nthat neither the College nor the Union\nplan to pay the ransom with Union\nPresident Jenny Morgan commenting\n\u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with criminals\u201d.\nThe robbery occured last Saturday\nat approximately 3:29:25pm. Initially\nthe College claimed that the thieves\nhad broken through 12 sealed titanium\nvaults by guessing the pin numbers, faking the voice recognition and blinking\nreally quickly to pass the retina scan but\na Hangman investigative squad (squir-rel) has uncovered a number of security\nfailures including, leaving the bananas\nunguarded in the street (see picture be-low). When shown this evidence, Union\nPresident Jenny Morgan commented\n\u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with squirrels\u201d.\nImperial has said that it is using all\nthe power at its disposal to track down\nthe thieves and recover the bananas.\nA private investigator (investigator of\nprivates) by the name Mr. Bananaman\nreportedly approached Imperial, offering to find the bananas for the small fee\nof \u00a580,000 but Union President Jenny\nMorgan responded \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with fictional characters\u201d.\nThe debacle has had further rami-fications. With students clamouring\nfor a low-cost fruit with a slow energy\nrelease, Imperial has turned to non-Fairtrade banana sources as a quick-fix\nto the banana shortage. Imperial apparently approached a number of banana\nfarmers from the deserts of North Africa to the icy steppes of Mongolia before finally finding a Brazilian farmer,\nMr Rodriguez who promised to satisfy\nImperial\u2019s banana needs. Despite Union\nPresident Jenny Morgan\u2019s protestations\nof \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with Brazilians\u201d,\nImperial reputedly signed a contract of\n3p per bunch with Mr Rodriguez.\nIt\u2019s this price thats got the attention of the Fairtrade organisation who\npointed out that 3p per bunch did not\nconstitute a living wage, emphasising\n\u201cYes, even for Brazilians\u201d.\nHangman sent a team (one guy) of\nreporters to Brazil (the bar) to hear the\nfarmer\u2019s side of the story. When asked\nwhy he agreed to the price, he said \u201cImperial have promised me an honorary\ndegree\u201d. We examined the conditions\nfor his workers and found that he was\nusing Imperial biology students who\nhad been decieved into thinking they\nwere going on a fieldtrip. Their families are now appealing to Union President Jenny Morgan to bring their children home, but she commented \u201cWE\nDON\u2019T NEGOTIATE BLAHAH!\u201d\nHangman\u2019s team\nof eggheads did\ncome up with a few\nsuggestions:\n\u2022 Inuit sirloin\n\u2022 Maori rib-eye\n\u2022 Bolshevik t-bone\n\u2022 Oriental rump\n\u2022 Red Indian fillet\n\u2022 Ethiopian blue\n\u2022 Dutch chops\nHow to play:\nIt\u2019s quite simple, all numbers are in a\ncell and must be surrounded with a\ncorresponding number lines.

The\nfriendliness of everyone at the lake had\nto be seen to be believed, by the week\u2019s\nend we were facebook friends with\nwakeboarders from several nationalities along with nearly all of the staff.\nCable wakeboarding is a relatively\nnew sport, born from the fact that fuelling a boat every time you want to ride\nis prohibitively expensive for all but the\nmost wealthy. A cable is very similar to\nthe \u2018drag lift\u2019 that you would see on a\nski slope, but for the fact that it is very\nhigh and is continuous. The first question most people ask when they see\nthe cable is \u201cwhat is the point in wakeboarding if there is no wake to throw\ntricks off?\u201d, there are two answers to\nthis question. Firstly cable lakes are\nusually rammed with obstacles such as\nrails and ramps from which to launch\nyour tricks, and secondly there is a\nspecial technique you can learn that allows you to utilise the elasticity of the\nsteel cables to rip you into the air from\nflat water, the so-called \u2018raley based\ntrick\u2019. There are now far more tricks\npossible on the cable than behind a\nboat, hence it has become a completely\nseparate discipline of wakeboarding\nwith different competitions etc.\nThe standard of riding amongst the\nseven of us ranged from experienced to\ncomplete beginner, and it is testament\nto the quality of Hip-Notics that not\none of us failed to improve drastically.\nThis was helped by the scorching midday heat, and the warm waters that allowed us to ride in board-shorts alone.\nThere was a multitude of obstacles for\nthe more-experienced to play on and\neven the beginners managed to have a\ngo at the ramps by the last day. Special\nmention goes to Bjorn who took brutal\nfront edges for the first four days only\nto impress us all on Day Five by not\nonly becoming confident on his board\nbut also taking on the big launch ramp,\nJennifer Finerty for landing the ramp\nand body-sliding the funbox only to\ncome out with a huge grin on her face,\nand Jak \u2018serial fives cheat\u2019 Wilkinson\nfor attempting a flat water raley having\nonly ever ridden for two weeks before\nthe trip. Lorenzon Pikey and Jonners\ndub were confidently hitting most of\nthe parks obstacles from day one with\nJon attempting inverts off the ramps\nwhilst Darko and I dedicated our time\nto flat water inverts along with rail rid-ing. We all had a fantastic time at HipNotics and are almost certainly going\nto head back there next Easter.\nAnyone wanting to give wakeboarding a try should contact me at\nwjp106@ic.ac.uk we run weekly trips\nto Thorpe Lakes and welcome people\nof all abilities.\nContinued from back page\nAcupuncture and Chinese\nHerbal Medicine\nW\nhat every patient\nasks me \u2013 how\ndoes acupuncture\nwork?\nThis is a big\nquestion that is rooted in philosophy\nand history. I would like to give a brief\nhistory and a brief explanation. There\nis a legend that some 7000 years ago,\nChinese physicians observed that soldiers wounded by arrows sometimes\nrecovered from illnesses, unrelated to\ntheir injuries, that had afflicted them\nfor many years. From this observation\nacupuncture developed, based on the\nprinciple that diseases can be treated\nby penetrating the skin at particular\npoints.\nThe story illustrates the importance\nof detailed observation in acupunc-ture. It was through observation that\nChinese physicians identified which\npoints on the skin affected and controlled specific organs. They went\non to show that by penetrating these\npoints with needles, a wide range of\ndiseases could be cured. It is generally believed that the first needles were\nmade of stone, and stone needles have\nbeen found in ancient tombs in Inner\nMongolia dating from 2500 BC. Wood,\nbone and ceramic needles were also\nused. Bronze needles became popular around 3000 years ago, during the\nChang dynasty. Today, needles are very\nfine, like a thread of hair, made of sterile surgical stainless steel. The needling\nsensation is different from having an\ninjection but you will experience some\nsensation like a tingling or a dull ache.\nSo how does this medicine work?\nAcupuncture, in brief, is a system of\nmedicine that aims to restore and\nmaintain health and it is rooted in\nChinese philosophy based on the concept of Qi. Our health is dependent\non the body\u2019s motivating energy, or\nQi, moving in a smooth and balanced\nway through a series of pathways or\nchannels in our body, beneath the skin.\nThis flow of Qi can get disrupted by a\nnumber of factors like extreme stress\nfrom exams, sitting at the computer\ntoo long without a break, eating on the\nrun, not enough time for exercise and\nrelaxation, going out every night partying and lack of sleep. These all cause\nstresses on the body and may manifest\nas Repetitive Strain Injury, Colds and\nFlu, Constipation, Headaches and the\nlist goes on.\nTheresa Szewczuk tells us all about this ancient medicine\nI am located in the Ethos treatment\nrooms on Wednesday afternoons nd\nearly evenings. A session for Imperial\nstudents is \u00a325 and for staff it is \u00a335.\nIf you have any questions or think you\nwould benefit from Chinese Herbal\nMedicine, please get in touch with me.\nFor more information call 07810 843\n594 or email me at acupuncture@flow-ingriver.co.uk or visit my website @\nwww.flowingriver.co.uk.\nPins and needles, literally, in the foot.\nO\nM\nCurrent economic climate\nforces Wakeboarding society\nto go to Turkey, but it was\nstill good\nImperial\u2019s 1st XI notch up\nanother voctory\nContinuing their successful season so\nfar, Imperial 1s rolled over LSBU last\nweekend to make a winning start to\ntheir ULU Cup campaign last weekend.\nBatting first on an uneven wicket,\nLondon Southbank collapsed to a paltry 98 all out in 25 overs. The Imperial\nseam attack, led by a youthful and fiery\ntrio of 1st years, proved their worth to\nthe club by making early inroads into\nthe LSBU batting line-up. Ahsaan Ismail, the Singapore Express, was the\npick of the bowlers taking 3 wickets,\nwhile Pete swallowed 3 victims and\nIan wolfed down a further hapless\nbatsman. It must be noted that a few,\nshall we say, \u201clenient\u201d umpiring decisions did help the proceedings (a little\nstrange given that the umpire was a\nLSBU squad member, although coincidentally he was left out of the playing\n11).\nTo Imperial\u2019s credit, they did not let\nthe tail wag, and turned the screw via\nconsistent tight bowling backed by a\ncommendable fielding display. While\non the subject of fielding, I have been\ntold that mentioning the Club CoPresident Shiraz Sabah\u2019s extremely late\narrival at the ground (about 3 overs\nthrough the 1st innings) and his subsequent drop catch at extra-cover from\na blasted shot travelling only an inch\nabove ground (incidentally the only\nblemish in an otherwise perfect fielding display) must not be mentioned as\nit may jeopardize my selection for future games. Therefore I will avoid this\ntopic completely.\nLSBU tried all sorts of tactics to derail the Imperial bowling attack, from\ndeeming the bending of the wrist illegal in the action of one of the seamers,\nto asking the spinner which way he intended on spinning the ball before he\nbegan his spell.\nDespite all this, the tail was bundled\nout thanks to bad shot selection and\na series of straighter ones from Daniel Johnpillai, who ended up with 3\nwickets.\nA target of 99 in 40 overs seemed an\neasy task, especially with the abysmal\ndisplay from the LSBU opening bowler,\nCricket\nImperial Men\u2019s 1st XI\nSouthbank Men\u2019s 1st XI\na lanky West Indian who thought he\nwas bowling at Kingston on a baked\nflat track, rather than an early season English strip in Feltham. A series\nof wide bouncers gave Imperial a flying start, reaching 25 for 0 in 2 overs.\nHowever he was replaced after 1 over,\nresulting in 2 quick wickets.\nThe runs dried up, and the introduction of a wily left arm orthodox spinner\ninto the attack didn\u2019t help matters. The\nmiddle order folded, leaving the home\nteam teetering at 60 for 5. In walks\nNavin Surtani to join the tardy Shiraz\nSabah at the wicket. In a gritty display\nof disciplined batting, they picked off\nthe runs one at a time to take Imperial\nover the line.\nFinally, the sledge of the day. In keeping with the agricultural theme, this\nweek\u2019s beauty must go to Ahsaan, who\nwhen faced with an extremely cautious\nbatsman came out with this \u2013 \u201cHe has\nmore leaves than a tree.\u201d Enough said.\nFAIL!

As already\nmentioned, the main problem that\nwas outlined in the survey was the\ncustomer service; however, they all\nseemed to be targeted at a handful of\nthe staff. The major criticism was that\na few of the staff were \u201cjust too slow\u201d to\ncustomers and that \u201cthe bar staff didn\u2019t\nreally understand what I was ordering.\nHow hard can it be to make a Gin and\nTonic?\u201d.\nIn his manifesto last year, Deputy\nPresident (Finance & Services), Christian Carter, stressed the need to improve the standard of service at Imperial College Union. When presented\nwith the results of this survey, Mr\nCarter told felix that\n\u201cWe welcome the results of this survey as part of our continuing effort to\nengage our students and better understand their views on our services. Since\ntaking office, catering has been one\narea I have worked with Union staff\non to improve. The evening menu, as\nyour survey shows, is well liked and\nreceived by our students. The process\nbehind the change of our evening offer\nis something I\u2019ve been working on this\nyear to help bring to our lunchtime\nservice.\u201d\n\u201cCurrently we run our lunchtime\nservice as a loss leader offset by other trading areas, the evening service\nisn\u2019t. We have proved that an evening\nservice can be both profitable and well\nreceived by the students and I look\nforward to working with our staff and\nnext years Sabbs to institute positive\nchange. The third phase of our building redevelopment which focuses on\nour ground floor trading outlets, will\nallow us to revaluate what our students\nrequire form their Union and we will\nbe seeking further feedback on exactly\nwhat it is they want before this phase\nstarts.\u201d\nEvery year, the candidates that take\npart in the Sabbatical elections comment on the quality of the service offered by both the bars and the catering\nservice, however, many have yet to see\nany one of them fulfil their promise of\nchange. Both Ashley Brown and Daniel Hill, who are President elect and\nDeputy President (Finance & Services)\nelect, have promised that they will improve the services, just as their predecessors have in the past. This reporter\nhopes that eventually, one of them will\nkeep to their promise.\nStudents give Union\ncatering service nul points\nStudent\u2019s dissatisfaction with the quality of the food on offer in the Union leads\nEditor-in-Chief, Jovan Nedi\u0107, to investigate the reasons\nWhat are the alternatives?\nSCR JCR Library Caf\u00e9 Sandwich Shop\nFood \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\nService \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\nPortion \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\nValue \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\nWell the main problem here is\nthat a lot of you can\u2019t go.

The\nreal question is what is going\nto be done about it and will the\neventual new design of the Union bring in an era of change and\nimprovement to the services.\nR\nude. Arrogant. Lazy. Unenthusiastic. Plain Rubbish. These are just a few\nof the phrases used by the\nstudents of Imperial to describe the bar and catering services\nprovided by Imperial College Union.\nIn a recent survey of 184 students carried out by felix, it was found that 77%\nof students were unhappy with the\nquality of the service they were being\nprovided with.\nImperial College Union has put in a\nlot of time and money into improving\nthe range of goods that are on offer,\nwith a major revamp of the bars and\ncatering services done last summer.\nThe result; a wider range of beers on\noffer as well as an energetic and all encompassing evening menu. They even\npaid to have the walls in both daVinci\u2019s\nand dB\u2019s redone in an attempt to revi-talise the areas and move it away from,\nas one student described, a \u201chospital\ncanteen\u201d. Even though they may have\nachieved this, the quality of the goods\nthat are produced are \u201conly as good as\nthe people who serve it\u201d, as one student\nput it.\nIn the survey, the students were\nasked to also point out what they\nthought was the main problem with\neach of the services. For the catering,\nthe main problem was the inconsistent\nquality of the food that was provided\non a daily basis; one student described\nthe quality of the food as ranging from\n\u201cplastic meat in stale bread to something that is actually edible\u201d. Asked to\nrate the quality of the food from one\nstar to four stars (four stars being the\nhighest), the students gave an average\nrating of two stars. Whilst the quality\ncould be improved upon, the portions\nthat were given out were considered\nto be quite good, getting an average\nrating of three stars. The price of the\nfood on offer, however, was split with\nopinions from both sides, some thinking that the prices were good for the\nportion size, whilst other thought that\nthe price was too much for the quality\nof the food.\nEarlier this year, felix managed to\nget hold of photographs of the quality\nof some of the kitchen facilities in the\nUnion. As can be seen by the picture\non the front page, the quality of one of\nthe kitchens could only be described\nas a germ factory; however, the Union has claimed that that particular\nkitchen has not been used for over a\nyear and that their kitchens are kept to\na very high standard. To verify this, felix decided to do a surprise visit to the\nkitchens in daVinci\u2019s, which are known\nto definitely be in use, and found out\nthat they were surprisingly clean.\nDespite the fact that the kitchens are\nactually extremely clean, the quality of\nthe food that they produce still seems\nbelow par in the eyes of the students\nthat they serve. Not only is the quality\nof the food inconsistent, but the survey\nalso showed that 77% thought that the\nservice offered by the staff was poor\nwith such comments as \u201cthe staff always seem grumpy\u201d and \u201cvery unhelpful\u201d. Even more worrying is what one\nstudent said. He told felix that \u201cthey\nnever seem to know what is in the food\nwhich is a problem if you have food al-lergies, and if you do ask, they always\nseem to give you a snide comment!\u201d\nSome of the more rather entertaining outcomes from the survey included 80% of students thinking that they\ncould cook better food than what the\nUnion had to offer, but when asked\nwhy they still come here, their reasoning was obvious. \u201cHome is too far from\nCollege\u201d said one student. \u201cThe Union\nis convenient and it is the only alternative to College food\u201d said another 3rd\nyear mathematician. But what seemed\nto be the underlying point was that\nmany of the students, just couldn\u2019t be\n\u201carsed\u201d to cook food themselves.\nAnother interesting fact was that\n71% of the students questioned, were\nunder the assumption that the Union\nwas making a profit on the lunch-time\nmenu when felix can reveal that they\nin fact make a loss of about \u00a340,000 a\nyear. This could be partly due to paying \u00a31.50 for a head of Iceberg lettuce\nor, the more likely option, due to the\nnumber of staff working the shift. All\nof the negative comments from the\nstudents were mainly focused around\nthe lunch time staff and menu at the\nUnion. In total contrast to the lunch\nresults, the opinion of the evening\nmenu was far better, with the only\ncriticism being the inconsistency of\nthe food, however, Mr Carter told felix\nthat.\nOn the other hand, the bars have received a better review, with the main\nproblem being the quality of the customer service provided by a minority\nof the staff. The problems highlighted\nby the students were minor, such as\n\u201cnot showing me how much I was being charged for on the card\u201d and \u201cnot\nICU Catering\nFood \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0b6\uf0b6\nService \uf0ea\uf0b6\uf0b6\uf0b6\nPortion \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0b6\nValue \uf0ea\uf0ea\uf0b6\uf0b6\n4 felix Friday 22 May 2009\nnews.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nNews news.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n5\nFriday 22 May 2009 felix\nNews\nAnd Finally: Cornish upset over inbred\njoke from RSM, again!\nJack Cornish\nYep, he is Cornish\nStudent loan interest rates\nfall to 0% from September\nStudent loans taken out after 1998 will\nsee their interest rate fall to 0% for the\nyear from 1st September 2009, due to\na decrease in the Retail Prices Index\n(RPI). However, the Government has\nused a \u201cget-out\u201d in the relevant legislation to avoid setting an interest rate\nof -0.4%, which would have seen loans\npay themselves off.\nThe post-1998 rate has previously\nbeen set to the lowest of the base rate\nof major British banks or the RPI from\nthe previous March, on a one year cycle starting in September.\nFor September 2009 this would have\nseen the rate set to -0.4%, the March\n2009 RPI. It was widely expected that\nthe Government would avoid setting\nan interest-paying rate, which they\nI\nt\u2019s a popular pastime of Imperial students to grumble about\nthe quality of the bar-staff at\nthe Union. As a member of that\nmuch pilloried section of Imperial society, allow me to address some\nof the concerns about the people that\nserve you drinks in daVincis.\nBefore I begin, lets make sure that\nwe have all the facts in order. The staff\nare almost entirely made up of Imperial students, your peers, and most of\nthe staff at present have been working\nfor almost a year or more. Put simply,\nwe\u2019re experienced and on top of this,\nthe job isn\u2019t particularly difficult. It\nmight be boring and tiring, certainly,\nbut it\u2019s not difficult.\nWith that in mind, allow me to\naddress two of the most common\ncomplaints.\n1. The staff are rude.\nThe bar-staff are students, your\npeers. In fact, most are 3rd or 4th year\nstudents, so excuse us if we don\u2019t call\nyou \u2018Sir\u2019. Also you may not have noticed but you\u2019re quite annoying when\ndrunk\u2026\n2. The staff are slow.\nThe staff aren\u2019t slow. During busy\nevents such as the Christmas Ball or\nSummer Ball, and during the exam\nseason, we often have better things to\ndo such as party or revise. The bar becomes understaffed and as a result the\nUnion hires external \u2018agency staff\u2019 who\nhave basically never worked in a bar\nbefore. The main consequence is that\nservice is very slow.\nIn any case, I\u2019d advise that the quality of service at the bar is perhaps not\nthe most important issue in the world.\nAnd if your stuck in a particularly long\nqueue, it\u2019s perfect conversation material with the cute girl waiting beside you.\nFinally, if you\u2019ve ever wondered why\nyou\u2019ve been passed over in the drinks\nqueue, it\u2019s either because you\u2019re being\nan obnoxious boar or more simply,\nyou were standing beside the barman\u2019s\nmate.\nKadhim Shubber\nDeputy Editor\nA view from\nthe other side\nof the bar\nS\no, we are all students here,\nand for the most part, our\ndays revolve around sleep,\nwork, beer, food and the occasion call to you mother to\ntell her that you are getting enough of\nthe aforementioned quantities (well\nperhaps not the beer). Being students,\nand supposedly self-supportive, we\nall quickly learn to love Sainsbury\u2019s\u2019\nreduced section. I remember in my\nfirst year I would actually factor in the\n22.55pm trip to ensure that I procured\nthe best deals, and by deals I mean\nfood that will be going off in an hour\nand five minutes. Yet still, for some obscure reason we will buy that pizza not\nbecause we like the topping, but because is has a whopping 45p off. That\u2019s\na lot to a student, buy four, eat one,\nfreeze the rest and use the spare cash\nto buy a pint. So when it comes to food\nwe all know what we want- cheap, lots,\nand it\u2019ll be an added bonus if its doesn\u2019t\nresemble cardboard.\nUnderstandably we get pissed when\nwe do spend our hard lent cash on\nwhat can only be described as shit.\nAnd the source of this shit? The Union, look at our survey 77% of people\nthink that the service is terrible. Once\nlast year I brought a coffee, as you do.\nYet this time, with the night before still\nraging in my head I managed to spill it\nall over the cashiers table, scalding my\nhand and losing half of my coffee in the\nprocess. What did I get for this? A free\nrefill? No. A severe bollocking. I was\nthe one losing out! I wanted to jump\nover the counter and nut him. But\nthen I thought no, best not, my tummy\nhurts and I may vomit. And that nicely\nbrings me onto my next subject.\nI am yet to find a Student Union that\nhas any Michelin stars, and fortunately\nCharles Murdoch\nFood and Drink\nwe don\u2019t yet offer Turkey Twizzlers,\nso I think Jamie Oliver will be mildly\nuninterested in cooking for us. Also,\neach one of us must admit to a trip\nto Burger King to demolish some reclaimed meat, or occasionally praying\nto the porcelain God in the sky because\nwe can\u2019t handle our drink. We don\u2019t really treat our bodies in way our mothers would be proud. So why should\nthe Union be forking out on expensive\n100% beef burgers (that still taste shite)\nand passing the cost onto us? All we really want is hot, cheap and reasonable\ntasting food, preferably lots. I am infuriated when I buy my lunch and then\nhave to go back to buy second lunch\nbecause I am still hungry. And no, I am\nnot a chunky motherfucker, 5\u201911\u201d and\n11.5 stone actually. Nobody comes to\nthe Union and expects \u2018seared Orkney\nscallops\u2019, but we do expect reasonable\nquality food at a reasonable price. Last\nTuesday the salmon on offer looked so\natrocious we wouldn\u2019t even stump up\nthe \u00a33.20 to buy it for photographic\npurposes. And to those people who did\neat it I wish a full and speedy recovery.\nLastly the Union should be filled at\nlunchtime, it\u2019s our Union and should\ncater directly for us, but it\u2019s neither.\nEveryone flocks to the JCR where it\nappears that cheap, quality, filling food\nis available. However, each Monday of\nFreshers\u2019 week, the Union is thronged\nwith Freshers\u2019 who know no better. After that, silent. If that isn\u2019t a big fucking\nred sign pointing out that what they\nare feeding us, and what we are being\ncharged is shit then they all need their\nheads reading.\nFor good food, my best advice is to\ninvest in a wool jumper, grow a beard\nand sneak into the SCR. You don\u2019t feel\nthe staff want to assassinate you either.\nOld, grumpy and\nbloody hungry\nAshley Brown\nlive.cgcu.net\nhave done by neglecting to set a rate\nat all. The effect of not setting a rate\nmeans loans will attract no interest, a\nrate of 0%.\nNumbers aside, it means the Government has been happy to take money from students when the RPI was in\nits favour, but has avoided reducing\nthe size of their loans now the tables\nhave turned. Figures released this week\nshow RPI falling even further, to -1.2%,\nmeaning the deal is even worse than\nwhen originally announced.\nDespite students losing out, the NUS\nPresident, Wes Streeting, welcomed\nthe 0% rate, saying\n\u201cIn the context of a recession, this\nis the best deal students and graduates could have expected. NUS will\ncontinue to monitor the rate of interest on student loans, and make sure\nthe Government is aware of students\u2019\nconcerns.\u201d\nUntil recently student loans had always adopted the RPI from the previous March, the rate changing every\nSeptember to reflect this. This had\na severe effect a couple of years ago,\nwhere the RPI doubled from 2.4% to\n4.8% in the space of a year. When the\nBank of England base rate dropped below the March 2008 RPI at the start of\nthe year, the Student Loans Company\ndropped the rate month-on-month to\nreflect this.\nA petition has been set up on the\nNumber 10 website, calling for the\nPrime Minister to restore the link\nto RPI and set a -0.4% interest rate:\nhttp://petitions.number10.gov.uk/\nLoansofstudents/.\nFirst reported on Live!\nlive.cgcu.net\nEvery year since 1902 the Royal School\nof Mines and the Camborne School of\nMines have fought for the mighty bottle that is currently placed behind the\nUnion Bar after RSM were victorious in\nthe latest rugby match hosted here in\nLondon. The final score was 14-10 and\n\u2018the bottle returned home\u2019. The match\nhas developed into a weekend\u2019s worth\nof activities including other sports and\ndinners with the accompanying rivalry.\nJokes and banter, on the whole, remain\nharmless and are taken with good spirit\nbut there have been instances in the\npast which have caused complaints.\nThe obligatory annual t-shirt that accompanies the weekend often points\nfun at the Cornish and the pitch side\nbanter towards the Camborne players is part of the cause, but some take\nit too much to heart. Or are they over\nreacting?\nThe most recent development in this\nsaga is a facebook group named \u2018Graeme Hicks is and idiot, and CSM are still\ninbred\u2019 created by Richard Simons, who\none can only assume meant \u2018\u2026an idiot\u2026\u2019 in his inspiring title. For those that\ndon\u2019t know, Graeme Hicks is Leader of\nKerrier District Council and Member\nof the Cornish County Council and has\npreviously complained about the RSM\nhockey website which has the following introduction, \u2018The Royal School of\nMines Hockey Club follows in a long\nline of RSM sporting prowess but most\nof all its about fun, drinking and beating the pulp out of little Cornish in-breds who like to call themselves miners\u2019.

    "content": "arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nArts\n14 felix Friday 22 May 2009\nCaz Knight previews some exciting happenings at the Tate Modern that you can enjoy this weekend\nW\nhat many people\nwill not realise is\nthat the Tate Modern, in addition\nto its temporary,\npaid-for events, has several floors of\npermanent collections which are free.\nNot only this, but once a year these\ncollections are \u2018rehung\u2019 and an entirely new collection of art works are\nbrought in. This Bank Holiday weekend the Tate Modern is hosting UBS\nOpenings: The Long Weekend, a four-day long spectacle of FREE events to\ncelebrate the new permanent collections on Level 3 and Level 5 of the\nmuseum: Scale & Energy and Processes, respectively. Each of the four\nwings which make up Levels 3 and 5\nwill feature a central \u2018hub\u2019 of works,\nwhich explore artistic movements\nSurrealism, Minimalism, post-war abstraction and Cubism, Futurism and\nVorticism. Emanating from the hubs\nare displays exploring predecessors\nand opponents to these movements.\nIn 1971, the Tate gallery invited minimalist sculpturer Robert Morris to create a retrospective of his work. What\nMorris created defied the preconceptions held by the curator. Instead of\ntransferring works from his native\nNew York, Morris created a new concept where he would test the relations\nbetween his work (the object) and the\nbody of the spectators of his work thus\nrelying on visitor participation. The\nexhibition was closed shortly after due\nto the enthusiasm and exuberance with\nwhich the viewers took part and the\nminor injuries they incurred. Despite\nthis age of excessive health and safety,\nthis weekend visitors to the Tate have\nthe chance, once more, to engage with\nMorris\u2019 \u2018Bodyspacemotionthings\u2019, from\nFriday to Monday from 10am-10pm.\nIn 1971 Morris made it clear that the\nplywood used in his sculptures was not\nto be returned to New York but dismantled and recycled. A pioneer in the\nGreen mentality it seems.\nOn Saturday from 5pm at Turbine\nHall Bridge, another recreation of history will take place when Michelangelo\nPistoletto will be rolling his Newspaper Sphere through the streets of\nSouthwark. First carried out in Turin,\nin 1966, Pistoletto\u2019s \u2018Ball of Newspapers\u2019 was a political yet playful endeavour which saw this giant ball rolled\nthrough the streets to highlight the\nglobal events of the preceding two\nyears. Arte Povera (\u2018poor art\u2019) came to\nbe when artists, like many thousand\nothers in France, Czechoslovakia and\nthe USA, of the time stood up against\nestablished institutions of government,\nindustry and culture. Revolutionary\nart was encouraged which lacked convention in both material and style. The\nlate sixties were a time of revolution\nand social upheaval and now seems a\nperfect time for this movement to feature at the Tate: a time of uncertainty,\nfloundering economy and unpopular\ngovernment.\nThe weekend, entitled \u201cDo it yourself\u201d, will allow visitors to climb over\nHow you can be a piece of art too\nA Robert Morris highlight. You too can get involved! It looks like fun, doesn\u2019t it? Better than revision...\nCuddly toys and body parts as art\nRosie Milton sees the confusingly named exhibition \u2018The Messengers\u2019 by Annette Messager\nA\nnnette Messager\u2019s retrospective show \u2018The Messengers\u2019 at the Hayward\nGallery on London\u2019s\nhive of artistic activity,\nthe South Bank, charts her production of work from the earliest sketches\nand drawings to more recent physical\ninstallations.\nThe first room of the exhibition presented a collage of images on the wall\n\u2013 a composition of figurative sources\nsuch as nipples and noses, which\nwhen combined created the effect of\ncartoon-like creatures, such as bats.\nA busy group of pencil illustrations of\nfemale nudes on another wall at first\nsuggested Messager\u2019s feminine expression of her sexuality through creativity,\nbut lurking male figures in the same\nscenes and contorted facial features\nthen suggested something darker and\nnightmarish.\nThis was just the beginning of a lifetime of work using soft materials and\ntextures, internal body parts and external surfaces to explore dream-like im-ages. Messager\u2019s main themes included\nthe displaced limbs of stuffed toys, the\norgans of the body blown up and made\nsoft to the point where they reached\nthat indefinable state between disturbing and comforting, and as a whole her\nwork recalled childhood memories of\nbeing \u2018tucked into\u2019 bed with a story\nnever finished.\nHer most mesmerising work of the\nexhibition was \u2018Casino\u2019, created for the\n2005 Venice Biennale, which won the\nprestigious Golden Lion Award. For\nthis installation a large room with a\nsingle doorway at the back was filled\nwith a blood-red sheet, similar to the\nsilk-like fabric of parachutes. A wind\nmachine worked from the back creating cascades of billowing fabric that\nundulated and fell like the steady\nmovement of a person\u2019s chest with\neach breath. Under the fabric large\nswellings intermittently glowed white\nlike jellyfish washed up on a beach in\nthe night. Gradually the lights dimmed\nand grew again as dark forms like giant keys descended from the ceiling in\na rhythm with the heaving mass of fab-ric. This poetic display of ambiguous\nforms \u2013 at once strange, yet familiar \u2013\nRobert Morris\u2019 exhibition, watch Pistoletto\u2019s newspaper ball roll through\nSouthwark, listen to live music, hear\nsound installations, experience performance art and watch films. It is\nall free and with four days to enjoy\nit this will prove to be a perfect anti-dote, whether you are celebrating the\nend of exams or seeking respite from\nacademia.\nThe Long Weekend\nTate Modern\n22-25 May 2009\nSee www.tate.org.uk/modern for full\ndetails.\nrequired several minutes of reflection.\nSigmund Freud called this psychological recognition unheimlich, or \u2018the uncanny\u2019. In his \u2018Dictionary for Dreamers\u2019\nTom Chetwynd remarks that \u201cmen\nhave evolved from something resembling sponges\u201d and Messager, whether\nconsciously or not, seems to play on\nthis theory with her soft fabric forms.\nRather than leaning on Freud\u2019s\nlargely misogynistic interpretation of\ndreams as being fundamentally based\non sexual desire and feminine irrationality or their supposed envy of\n\u2018that\u2019 body organ, Messager is instead\nrecreating childlike innocence \u2013 the\nconfusion and jumble of images and\nwords that makes up a child\u2019s first understanding of the world. She explores\nthis by using children\u2019s drawings in her\nearly work and creating a nursery for\nsparrows among other creative outlets.\nHer photographic work which explores\nthe orifices and \u2018dark corners\u2019 of the\nhuman body is a far cry from the generic representations of beauty which\nwe seem so obsessed with today. Body\nhair, wrinkles and fleshy anomalies\nagain stray into the realm of the uncanny and recalls Hoffmann\u2019s tale \u2018The\nSandman\u2019 which embodies the sensory\nnotion of recognition yet at the same\ntime repulsion of that which we see as\nfamiliar.\nMessager\u2019s work overall explores her\npersonal identity sometimes in a \u2018real\u2019\nway that was easy to relate to \u2013 as a\nchild and a woman \u2013 but at other times\nonly recognisable as being that which\nhas defined Messager\u2019s existence as a\nhuman being with her own individual\ncomprehension of the world.\nAnnette Messager\u2019s\nThe Messengers\nAt the Hayward Gallery\nUntil 25th May\nAnnette Messager with some of her lovely art.

Write for us.\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\narts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n13\nFriday 22 May 2009 felix\nArts\nPeer Gynt: forty scenes of\nNorwegian human-troll\nhybrids\nCaz Knight goes to see an exciting modern adaptation of Peer\nGynt at felix Arts favourite venue, the Barbican\nin love with at the wedding reception,\nseeks him out to live by his side forev-er. The second half hurtles us through\ntime and space to Peer\u2019s middle age in\nAfrica where he has made his fortune\nthrough nefarious endeavours (people\ntrafficking, arms smuggling\u2026). Peer\u2019s\neventual journey back home to Solveig\nproves to be thoroughly soul-searching\nas he contemplates what it means to be\ntrue to oneself. Ibsen\u2019s play shuttles\nus between Peer\u2019s conscious and sub-conscious; blends fantasy and realism\nwhile disregarding any convention for\nthe bounds of space or time that audiences of the time would have been accustomed to at the theatre. Today in\nthis post-psychedelic era, it is of little\nmatter to us, but such is the fantasti-cal nature of this work that one is often\nleft wondering how much of this surrealism is the original and how much is\nmodern interpretation.\nThis colossal forty scene play spins\nus through a whirlwind of emotions\nand settings as we try and keep up with\nthe unruly, boozy and inexhaustible\nenergy of Keith Flemming\u2019s young Peer\nGynt and then Gerry Mulgrew\u2019s old\nPeer in the second half: ever so slightly\ntempered in disposition but equally insane and still trapped in his imaginary\nkingdoms. The second half is where\nthe play comes into its own, devoid of\nthe booming and incessantly bawdy\nhumour of the first half while being\never more resonant in its emotional\npoignancy and even having this reviewer dangerously close to shedding a\ntear when a half naked old Peer comes\nback from dreaming to find himself in\na mental hospital, confused and unable\nto remember the name of his doctor.\nDominic Hill has created a production which is seamless in its execution\nand choreography and which manages\nto excel in its moments of pathos. The\ncreative team have conjured up a show\nwhich is stunning in its use of set de-sign, lighting and live music to realise\nthis deluded, fantasy world in which\nour anti-hero lives and his eventual\njourney back home to his loved one\nwho has waited for him all this time.\nThe production remains faithful to\nthe original in plot and meaning while\nproving that Peer Gynt and its subplot\nare utterly transferable to this epoch\nwhile the idea of being true to oneself\nhas never been more topical in this society of preconceptions, pressure and\nexpectations.\nPeer Gynt was on at the very\nlovely Barbican but unfortunately\nhas now closed\nS\nince I last botched together\nan editorial for felix I have:\nturned 21, cut my hair short,\nvisited the Houses of Parliament twice, revised for my\nfinals, sat my finals, got a job for next\nyear, had a death in the family and visited at least four different art exhibi-tions. All of which I could talk about at\nlength. But I\u2019m not going to! Today I\u2019m\ngoing to answer the eternal question:\nwhat is art?\nI got thinking about this very early\non the morning after I went to see\nthe Gerhard Richter exhibition at the\nNPG, which I reviewed last week and,\nessentially, slated. What interested me\nwas why I hated it so much. I think the\nreasons can be categorised under three\nheadings: lack of skill, lack of attractiveness and lack of meaning. Firstly,\nthis Richter dude had got a few photographs and made them blurry. Big deal.\nSecondly, I didn\u2019t even like the look of\nthese photographs. I certainly wouldn\u2019t\nwant to hang them on my wall at home,\nand looking at them gave me a head-ache. And, lastly, I didn\u2019t see the point\nRichter was trying to make with them.\nWhat was the guy thinking aside from\n\u201chmm, let\u2019s get some photographs,\nmake them blurry, then maybe somebody will pay me for them \u2013 woohoo!\u201d?\nWhenever I think about what art is,\nI\u2019m taken back to a very dreary AS level\nGeneral Studies lesson, taught by a\nteacher I particularly hated, who clear-Emily Wilson\nArts Editor\nly had a lot of apathy for the subject.\nForced to teach us about culture and\nthe arts, he screwed up a paper towel,\nthrew it down on the desk, and said \u201cis\nthis art?\u201d He asked for a show of hands\nof who thought it was. My lone hand\ncrept up. He asked why. I said \u201cbecause\nI think it is\u201d. This made him laugh in\nmy face somewhat, but my point was\nthat art is in the eye of the beholder. It\u2019s\nsubjective and impossible to define. In\nretrospect, I mostly felt sorry for the\npaper towel, I felt somebody deserved\nto stand up for it. And to me it represented the pointlessness of teaching\narts and culture out of a textbook for a\nmandatory, pointless qualification used\nto bump up the school\u2019s UCAS points.\nSo I guess it had meaning.\nBut this recent sleepless morning\nI had a minor revelation. I\u2019ve decided\nthat art is just stuff to take up space\nand time. It is filler. Art is something\nto brighten up a blank wall, something\nto listen to on the way to college, or\nsomewhere to go at the weekend. If\nthat art brightens up that blank wall\nparticularly well, and we look at it and\nsay \u201coh, gosh, that\u2019s clever \u2013 I couldn\u2019t\nhave done that!\u201d then that makes it a little better. And if that art on the blank\nwall makes us look at it and think about\nthings we hadn\u2019t thought about before,\nthen that\u2019s better still. But it\u2019s still just\nfiller. Try walking around an art gallery\nthinking \u201cfiller\u201d to yourself, over and\nover again. It\u2019s very liberating.\nAh, but what\nis Art?\nThirty hours of Gilbert & Sullivan!\nLucy Harrold sits through a whole marathon of Gilbert and Sullivan classics and learns to love them\nI\nhave to admit I know very little\nabout Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s\u2019 Savoy Operettas. My sole knowledge is based on a concert production of Trial by Jury where\nI sat so close behind the conductor\nI could see the words, and Sideshow\nBob\u2019s rendition of HMS Pinafore in\nThe Simpsons. I\u2019ve never seen the appeal of them; Gilbert and Sullivan form\nthe fine line between grandiose Opera\nand the more familiar territory of musical theatre. I don\u2019t get the point of\nsomething written in English that you\ncan\u2019t hear the words to \u2013 why bother?\nThe plots seem bright, breezy and\nridden with aristocracy; Lord So-AndSo wishes to marry some princess but\nhe can\u2019t because of some upper class\nreason. Lame. After being inspired by\nMarcus Brigstocke\u2019s jolly Room 101\nrip-off \u2018I\u2019ve Never Seen Star Wars\u2019 (in\nwhich \u2018celebrities\u2019 try something new\ne.g. Esther Rantzen listens to rap mu-sic, what a hoot!). Having finished my\nexams I decided to take in some G&S.\nDespite abandoning G&S completely\nin 2004, Imperial\u2019s Musical Theatre\nSociety (MTSoc) still upholds the tradition of the Gilbert and Sullivan Marathon. The marathon is held every five\nyears with each of the 13 Savoy Operas\nbeing presented, sandwiched by \u2018Trial\nby Jury\u2019 at the beginning and end, in\na thirty hour extravaganza held in our\nvery own concert hall.\nIn true MTSoc style, shows are\npunctuated by much eating, drinking\nof tea and merry banter, whilst trying\nto stay awake enough to sing or play an\ninstrument. As well as having a lot of\nfun, money is raised for RAG. Over a\nhundred people answered the call to\nfill the vast number of roles on offer,\nas well as providing a chorus and orchestra for each show, all drawing from\ncurrent students, alumni and G&S fans\nalike.\nI arrived midday Saturday to catch\n\u2018The Gondoliers\u2019 \u2013 already the fourth\nP\neer Gynt (pronounced \u2018Per\nGynt\u2019) was Henrik Ibsen\u2019s\nlast attempt at writing a play\nin verse. Aimed at being\na satire of the Norwegian\npersonality, it was met with hostility\nin 1867, the date of its publication, and\ndisliked for its overdose of magic: fairy\ntales taken to the extreme and twisted\nwith prurience and the unwell, despite\nIbsen\u2019s claim that \u201cthe conception of\npoetry in our country, in Norway, shall\nshape itself according to this book\u201d.\nThe National Theatre of Scotland\nand Dundee Rep Ensemble\u2019s produc-tion, staged at the Barbican\u2019s sumptuous theatre, is a modern adaptation\nwhich reworks the Norwegian odyssey into a contemporary setting while\nlosing none of the essence of Ibsen\u2019s\nclassic.\nPeer Gynt is a lay-about, living the life\nof avoidance tormenting and shaming\nhis \u201cpoor, pretty, ugly mum\u201d, drinking,\nshagging and perpetually in his own\ndream world of which he is emperor.\nAfter crashing a wedding reception in\nthe local village, running off with the\nbride, engaging three troll-courting\nmilkmaids in the mountains, fathering\na half-troll and half-human son, Peer\nGynt takes up a life of solitude where\nSolveig (\u201cSylvie\u201d), the village girl he fell\nThis guy\u2019s mates are not impressed by his newly acquired halo\nThe sheer number of people involved surely shows how widely appreciated and loved Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s Savoy Operettas are even today\nThe cast of Peer Gynt performing a new disco dancing craze. That or they\u2019re falling over. I can\u2019t tell\nshow of the day. I was unsurprised to\nfind the plot involved a Duke\u2019s daughter married at the age of one to a King\nnow masquerading as a Gondolier,\nleading me to think I wasn\u2019t going to\nenjoy this next few hours.\nDespite managing to predict the\nending, I was entertained by the goings on in Venice. Highlights included\nJames Hallett and Ed Hughes as the\ntwo Gondoliers, given the power of\njoint-Kingdom in exchange for dumping their wives, and Ben Rowe as the\nHigh Inquisitor who gives them the\npower. I still wasn\u2019t convinced that Gilbert and Sullivan\u2019s works were nothing more than a poor man\u2019s opera, but\nstayed a while longer.\nActually, I ended up staying until\ngone 11pm and helped cook dinner\n(everyone helps out when you\u2019ve got\ncontinuous light opera on the go). The\nevening\u2019s entertainment was \u2018The Yeomen of the Guard\u2019 and one of the reasons I did help with dinner. Yeomen\nwas definitely not a highlight for me.\nThis was not down to the perform-Yeah, I\u2019m a little disappointed by the lack of costumes too. But 30 hours? I take my hat off to these singers! At least I have a hat to take off\ners, all of whom were pitch perfect and\nrarely made mistakes despite tiredness\nand lack of practice setting in. The plot\nhad something to do with a man being\nexecuted and some people falling in\nlove. Plus it was really long. \u2018Yeoman of\nthe Guard\u2019 cemented my original preconceptions of Gilbert and Sullivan \u2013 a\nflimsy plot and lots of sopranos making noises that don\u2019t sound like words.\nLooking at the schedule for the rest\nof the marathon I decided upon returning for \u2018The Sorcerer\u2019, as a friend\nhad a large role in it and the title reminded me of Harry Potter. Anticipating the marathon would be running\nlate, I managed to miss the beginning\nof \u2018The Sorcerer\u2019 but easily caught up\nwith the plot.\nThis piece seemed different from the\nothers - the plot was simple but effective and the songs were more in the\nstyle of musical theatre. Rob Felstead\n(who also coordinated the entire affair)\nshone as Alexis and was well matched\nby Rebekah Engeler. Dave Phipps Davis\nkept us all awake and entertained with\nsome hilarious ad libs that I\u2019m sure the\nEdwardians would have disapproved\nof.\nThe marathon ended with \u2018Trial by\nJury\u2019 (as per tradition) with those not\ncompletely catatonic retiring to the bar\nto discuss the overnight highlights I\nhad missed, and to debate which operetta is best (general opinion sided with\nmy favourite, \u2018The Sorcerer\u2019).\nI was very impressed with the high\nlevel of performance, even into the last\nhours of the marathon. Impromptu\ndancing occurred frequently, with\nprops hastily grabbed from the table\nof food. Everyone was there because\nof their love of performing Gilbert and\nSullivan, which gave the epic event a\nreal feeling of community and affec-tion. The marathon has encouraged\nme to not be so afraid of G&S, so maybe I\u2019ll even see some more!\n\n"
