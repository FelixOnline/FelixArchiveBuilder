    "content": "Music Felix 937 5 June 1992\nRight Said\n-Equinox\nFred The Real People\n-Underworld\nThey knew we were coming\ntonight. There was red carpet rolled\nout onto Leicester Square, and\nlimos, and crowd control barriers.\nAll for me. I'm a star. The VIP reopening of the Empire Ballroom, as\na new club, competing directly on\na level with the hippodrome. No\ncontest. This place kicks the living\ndaylights out of that place, leaves\nit stu gg ling for breath. The\nHippodrome is crap. Equinox is\nnot.\nOf course, being a premium club,\nin a prime site can lead to certain\nprestigious prices. Lager at \u00a32.80\na pint is not really good for the\nstudent pocket. And at anything up\nto twelve quid to get in, it begins\nto look like a very expensive\nevening. But fear not. Tuesdays is\nstudent night, and it comes back\ninto the realm of the living. \u00a3 1 . 5 0\nto get in, and \u00a31.50 a pint. And it's open until 3.30. Not the thing for\nthose with exams the next day, but\nfor the rest.\nRight Said Fred, incidentally,\nwere absolutely storming during\ntheir three song set (Can you guess\nwhat those three songs were,\nreaders?).\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Equinox, at the Empire, Leicester\nSquare (north side). Open Tuesday\nto Saturday, from 9pm. It was the first time I'd actually\ngone to the Underworld and I was\npleasantly surprised. The drinks\nweren't too expensive! We stood\naround patiently waiting when the\nTambourines came on. I wasn't expecting much (as they were\nsupport at a small venue), but I was\nwrong, they were pretty good. For\na while I thought it would be one\nof those rare occasions when a support band outshone the\nMachine Gun Feedback\nHey I'm a Spaceman\nMachine Gun Feedback: Hey, Vm a Rockstar\nFalcon\nThey say first impressions last, in\nthe case of this 12\" there are four\nfirst impressions\u2014it would appear\nthat The Machine Gun Feedback\ndon't really know what kind of\nmusic they're trying to make. The\nA side is a couple of wonderful\nearly Wonderstuff sound-a likes.\nThe B side however goes off at a tangent. Having said that the 12\" is\ninspiring ly different and\nimpressing ly good.\nPurple Velvet.\nOut now on Sacred Heart.\nmusic editor asked me what I was\ndoing that night (no he hasn't extended his tastes to blok es);a chance to go and listen to Machine\nGun Feedback live, whom I had\nreviewed the week before.\nAnyway back to the present (well\nsort of). Having enjoyed their new\nep I thought 'what the hell', and\ncome 9pm I was stood outside the\nCamden Falcon thinking 'I'm going\nin there?'. I had already been\nforewarned that the gig room was\na real pit\u2014and were they right?\nBack to the music. Machine Gun\nFeedback were on first with no\nintroduction and they didn't ever\nbother either. What can I say?\nBetter live than on a recording. It\nhas to be said that the cartoons\nplaying in the background were\nmore interesting than the act but the\nmusic was on top form. A sort of\nprimitive psychedelic rock.\nGodlike Bass came on shortly\nafter with some heavy duty crosses\nbetween metal and goth\u2014totally\nmind blowing and worth moving to.\nGetting too near the platform (stage\nis too grand a term) was positively\ndangerous with flying hair and\nmicrophone stands on the loose.\nA most excellent night out with\nsome good grooves that I can see\nturning big time in the future.\nPurple Velvet\nheadlining band, but on came The\nReal People and showed me why\nthey were the main act. Their set\nwas much better than the\nTambourines, even though their\nstyle was similar. Their fans,\nhowever, were fans of both bands,\nso both got good support from the\naudience.\nThe best thing for me was that\nboth bands were s couse, as were a lot of the fans following them, so\nI felt right at home.\nBov.\n\u2022 'Believer' is out now on\nColumbia.\nThis Picture\n-Borderline\nThe lead singer of This Picture\nstarts this concert fully dressed, and\nproceeds through varying stages of\nundress throughout the evening,\nfrom 'Step Up' through '5.30' to\n'Death's Sweet Religion', avoiding,\nas ever, 'The Great Tree', and\nshowcasing some new tracks, most\nof which remain sadly nameless, at\nleast to us, the audience. But the\nswelling rush encapsulated in 'A Violent Impression', remains, if\nslightly watered down, with a slightly unfinished feel to them.\nThis Picture stun, delight, and\nconfuse all at once.\nLise Yates\nThe Orb\n-Blue Room\nThe Orb return with a brand new\nslice of ambience, drifting in and\nout of consciousness like a bleary\neyed dream, which apparently\nclocks in at just under forty minutes\nin its full version. Fortunately for\nus we have been furbished with a four minute edit. This is an amazing\npiece of music, and the fate that it\nsounds almost the same as\neverything else The Orb have ever\ndone is irrelevant.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Blue Room is out on Monday.\nT7ie Orb play Brixton Academy\ntonight, 9pm6 am. \u2014 1 0 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Letters Felix 937 5 June 1992\nA Total Farce Curried Prunes\nDear Adam,\nAfter today'sEG M someone\nturned to me (knowing I take an\ninterest in our C CU and therefore\nam tarred with the brush of ICU)\nsaying 'by the way I liked your\nEG M today' his statement implying\nthat although held in the JCR with\nmicrophones it probably had the\nattention of about 40 people and was\na total farce.\nI replied that UGM's are only\nwhat the students make of them, to\nthis he answered (as is typical of\nmost IC students) 'well if the Union\nelects itself to all its posts how can\nyou expect the students to take an\ninterest?'\nWhen will the average IC student\nrealise, that the student unions (ICU\nand CCU's alike) do not 'elect\nthemselves' they elect people who\nare interested in running them and\nbother to stand for the posts.\nIf this means th t only a small\nselection of people go from post to\npost then its the students who are\nto blame. Posts must be Fdled\notherwise those selfsame students\nwho criticise the Union and deride\nall involved will com palin when\nthings aren't done.\nAnyone can stand for a post but\nthey have to know what's involved\nto do it properly\u2014to know requires\ntaking an interest in your Union, if\nthis means only those who have\nbeen branded ICU/ C CU hacks\nstand it's because they've bothered\nto take an interest.\nI know this is an old rant but it's obviously still valid. Either get\ninvolved and improve what you\nthink is wrong or shut up.\nCriticism for criticism's sake is\npointless.\nSarah E Welsh.\nP.S. ISE Dep Rep, Publicity\nOfficer (C& GU), Hon Sec Elect\n(C& GU), therefore aCC U 'hack-to most people and derided for it.\nDear Adam,\nPoor old Declan, he's got it\nwrong again! Clearly he is allowing\nhis socialist beliefs to cloud his\nobjectivity in his analysis of\n'Voluntary Student Unions' (Felix\n935).\nI have no objections to him\npublishing his opinions, but his\ninaccurate comments about IC\nConSoc need to be corrected.\nNo Union money whatsoever is\npaid by IC ConSoc to affiliate to the\nConservative Party in any shape or\nform.\nWe do pay a nominal fee of \u00a3 1 0\nto affiliate to the Greater London\nArea Conservatives, but this comes\nfrom members subscriptions,\nfurthermore, as we are a democratic\nsociety we do ballot our members\neach year to check that our\naffiliation is in accordance to their\nwishes. No one has ever voted\nagainst this affiliation. As a student\norganisation we do not pay any\nmoney to affiliate to Conservative\nStudents (which happens to be the\nsame as Conservative Collegiate\nForum).\nSo any money received from the\nunion is not used to stimulate\ngreater student interest in centre\nright politics.\nClearly Declan has not got over\nhis party's disappointing\nperformance, at the General\nElection, or the recent collapse of\nIC Labour Club!\nYours,\nMark Richards,\nChairman,\nIC Conservative Society.\nSOUTHWELL HALL\nSUBWARDENSHIPS\nApplication forms available from\n15 Princes Gardens\nTODAY IS THE LAST DAY\nplease leave forms in Room 438, Sherfield\nPlease note:\nInterviews will now be held on Tuesday 9th June (not\n10th as previously stated)\nICU Social Colours\nStudents\nAdamson, Hilary\nAlam, Zayeed\nBathe, Colin\nBoland, Peter\nBoon, Carl\nBurke, Doug\nBurnell, Jeremy\nButterworth, Jonathan\nChadha, Gaurang\nClipstone, Lucia\nCotton, Tim\nCreissen, Angie\nCurry, Declan\nEllis, Marc\nEspejo, Raul\nEvans, Lisa\nEyers, Richard\nFernley, Joe\nFischer, Emma\nFox, Nikki\nHay, Graeme\nHeino, Flemming\nHenderson-Begg, David\nHolmes, Darren\nHorton, Elizabeth\nIsaacs, Rufus\nJones, Andrew C Jones, Demi\nKerr, Andy\nLandon, Mark\nLawton, Graham\nMortley, Gina\nMountford, Rachel\nNewhouse, Steven\nNield, John\nNothrop, Paul\nPayne, Mark\nRandall, Mark\nRao, S.K.

The\nother 'hovercraft' consists of cut out\npieces of plywood waiting to be\nbonded together, then fibreglass ed, have a new skirt made and fitted an\nengine and drive gear installed.\nThe Motor Club, whilst maybe\nbeing the largest of its type, has 200\nmembers of which about 80 are\nactive. This is known because the\nClub has a championship and\nanybody who participates in any\nevents such as club nights or rallies\ngets points in this championship. To\nclaim it is the best is disputable,\nwhen it never enters the National\nStudent Motorsport Championships, though it did some years ago,\nbut the crews didn't get into the top\n5 placings. Incidentally, Leeds\nUniversity Motor Club does best,\na small but active club.\nOf course, these are just two\nclubs, so now to an event or two.\nHow about the Cocktail Party. The\norganiser of this went through the\nguest list with the President of\nGuilds so a good representation of\npeople in industry would be there.\nFrom this one would deduce that\nwhilst the organiser organised the\nvenue, the drinks etc, both were\nhappy with the invites. Wrong!!!\nThe organiser in fact received an\nincredible ear bashing when many\nof the guests turned out to be from\nICU, local authorities, etc, i.e. not\nindustry. In fact, the Major\nCaptains of Industry were notable\nin their absence!\nThen there's the May Ball. An\nEvelyn Gardens Hall of Residence\norganised a May Ball with 95\npeople attending. The food was\nbetter and it didn't have a guest\nspeaker with all the wit, charm and\ncharisma of a sack of potatoes.\nThen there's the finance. Did you\nknow that the Guild's President gets\ntwo free terms in Southside? Not\nbad is it? It gets better. Because at\nthe C&G General Committee\nMeeting a spreadsheet of Union\nexpenditure was shown and the\nHonoraria of the Executive\nCommittee was overspent by \u00a3120.\nThis was due to the president\nspending two weeks of his summer\nholiday in South Ken and charging\nit to the Union. Not very\nresponsible is it? Particularly when\nhe could have stayed with 'friends'.\nI would therefore conclude that\nthe article was blatantly biased\nbullshit and I'd like to see the author\nof this article reply to my criticisms.\nIf they know their stuff they'll be\nvindicated. I suspect not however...\nYours sincerely,\nName withheld by request.\n\u2014 2 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "5 June 1992 Felix 937 Music\nCarter USI\n- Academy The Frank & Walters are better than\nThe Sultans Of Ping FC. There is\nno doubt about it. There line in\ninter-song banter would probably be\nvery amusing, were it\ncomprehensible. At least the songs\nwere recognisable, including covers\nof 'Funky Cold Medina' and The\nMonkees' 'Believer', thrown in\namongst their own songs, their\nanthem, 'We Are The Frank &\nWalters', and assorted other\nselections from ep l,e p2 and ep3. Carter axe also better than The\nSultans Of Ping FC. But it's their\nfans that puzzle me. Tonight the\nAcademy is a sea of white, the\nwhite of Carter shirts, with the odd\nfloating jetsam of new blue Carter\nshirts, and black shark fins in black\nCarter shirts. Anyone would think\nthey we didn't know that they liked\nKingmakei\n-T&C call me ag it if it pleases you more,\nbut in the days when I bought a Tshirt at every gig I went to, things\nused to be done differently. Why on\nearth is it that nobody wants to be\na pop star anymore? In the good ole\ndays (about two years ago) bands\nactually seemed to give a toss about\nwhether 'the kids' were enjoying\nthemselves, but in the era of the\nanonymous shoe gazer that seems\nold hat. Tonight, Kingmaker are\nabysmal. If any of their songs were\nvaguely memorable I might have\nforgiven them for being so\ncompletely miserable but this band\nare going nowhere fast. Admittedly,\nfor all of their five minute intro I thought I was going to enjoy them,\nbut then they ruined everything by\ncoming on in a blaze of glory\nunrivalled since John Major last had\npeas for dinner. I can't put my\nfinger on what it is I don't like about\nKingmaker, maybe because my\nfinger is not big enough to cover all\ntheir faults, but at a push I'd sum\nthings up by saying that they take\nthemselves too damn seriously! Not\n, Frank &\nCarter. Do they only have one Tshirt, and if so, how do they keep\nit so white. No one would think that\nsimply because they didn't wear a Carter T shirt that they didn't like\nCarter. Not after moshi ng through\nan hour and half of Carter, their\nown songs and everyone else's The Smiths, The Jam, Pink Floyd.\nAnd the loss of John Beast has\ndeeply affected their show, not as\nif the Carter fans have noticed.\nThey still scream his war cry, 'You\nFat Bastard', as if nothing had\nchanged, but it has changed. No\nmore stages vanishing in a wall of\nlight. No. It was not in the least bit\npainful to see the band all the way\nthrough, apart from the inherent\npain involved in seeing them.\nCarter played all the songs you'd expect and finished with 'GI Blues',\nas you'd expect.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Carter release a new single, 'Do\nRe Me So Far So Good', on 22nd June, through Chrysalis.\n, Suede\nonce during their whole\n'performance' does anybody in the\nband say anything more than the\nobligatory 'Cheers, Ta, that was\ncalled...', hardly the stuff that\nmega-stars are made of. Okay, so\nI'm being a bit harsh on\nKingmaker, after all it's not as if\nthey're the only ones at fault.\nFor all the hype about Suede they\ntoo have a long way to go before\nthe quality of their live show\nmatches that of their songs.\nHowever, the very fact that Suede\nhave some songs has endeared them\nto me already, Suede could be big,\nvery big and very soon. They have\nwhat Kingmaker don't,a sense of\nhumour and a sense of theatre and\nthat puts them way ahead of much\nof the current pack of angry but\ngutless bands. I could be wrong\nabout Kingmaker, maybe the future\nof rock 'n' roll lies with singers that\ncan't sing, tunes you can't remember three minutes after you\nhear them and awkward silences\nbetween songs in a live set, but I hope not...if only for the sake of\nSuede who appear to have a lot\nmore to offer the world.\nMcCarter.\n\u2022Kingmaker's 'Killjoy was Here'\nep is out now on Chrysalis. Suede's 'The Drowners' is out on Nude.\nFrank and Walters: burble burble burble\nThe Pale\n-Dogs with no\nTails\nYet another band from Ireland but\nthis time they're using fairly\nclassical Irish folk sounds\u2014and\ndoing a fair job of it. Slightly catchy\nperhaps even slightly more-ish, but,\nI'm afraid to say, not the best thing\nsince sliced bread or even sliced\nbutter for that matter!\nPurple Velvet.\n\u2022 Out now on A&M. Power of Dreams\n-Marquee\n1\n_ me of two things, one, that Power\n^ = =1-| - Of Dreams are used to tropical\nHit ill H climates; throughout their set, they\nm== play with energy and conviction,\nand two, that Power Of Dreams\nThe Marquee is u usually warm fans are used to similar\ninside. Tonight it's unbearable. The environments. They found it easy\ntemperature is absolutely to mosh until the steam rose from\nsensational. The combination of 800 their heads. They sound,\nsweaty bodies and 80 degree incidentally, like an Irish\ntemp ara ture s is too much for a Kingmaker.\nconsistent review. I can't tell you Lise Yates,\nall the songs they played, as I kept \u2022 '2 Hell With Common Sense' is\nhaving to retire to cooler climes, out now on Polydor.\nWhat I did see, though, convinced\nRain-Marquee\nhave some new stuff now, and I thought I spotted a tune in there\nsomewhere. My X ray eyes espied\nit, and I'm sure with a little\nnurturing, and tender loving care,\nthey might grow into something a little tree with sweet, rosy fruit. But\nlike an apple tree, this is going to\ntake a long time to grow into a flourishing orchard.\nLise Yates\nLive\n-Operation\nSpirit\nPreviously living its life as the\nweakest cut on the '4 songs' ep,\nnow released as a single in it's own\nright, appa ent ly due to public\ndemand. Live sound like a cross\nbetween Simply Red and REM,\ntaking the best of both worlds and\ncoming up with nothing.\nLise Yates\n\u2022 Relased on Radioactive records.\nRain used to be crap. There's no\ndenying it. Perhaps they still are.\nThat, dear heart, is what we're\nabout to find out.\nRain's old songs are still crap.\nI'm glad we found that out. They\n\n"

    "content": "Feature Felix 937 5 June 1992\nThe situation was made even\nmore complex when the Irish\nSupreme Court delivered its verdict\non the X case. Initially, it appeared\nthat the Supreme Court had gone\nbananas, but on closer inspection\ntheir judgement accurately reflected\nthe constitutional amendment. The\namendment reads, 'The state\nacknowledges the right to life of the\nunborn and, with due regard to the\nright to life of the mother,\nguarantees in its taw s to respect,\nand, as far as practicable, by its\nlaws to defend and vindicate that\nin Ireland, but this was an\nirrelevancy, as she had already gone\nto Britain for the termination by the\ntime the Supreme Court judgement\nhad been announced.\nThe judgement, in conjunction\nwith the Maastricht protocol,\ncaused heat, fury, and very little\nlight. Pro-life, anti-abortion\ncampaigners claimed that\nratification of Maastricht would\nlead to the imposition of abortions\nin Ireland, and demanded a new\nreferendum to completely outlaw\nabortion without any confusion.\nand the child, would a new\nreferendum give more importance\nto the life of the child as opposed\nto the life of the mother? Would\nprecedence of citizenship be given\nto a foetus that is not even a citizen?\nPro-choice, pro-abort i ori campaigners were far from happy,\nas Maastricht and the Supreme\nCourt ruling would lead to a ban on\nthe right to travel for pregnant\nwomen, and a continuation of the\nban on the right to information.\nThey also wanted a referendum, to\nplace rights to travel and\nright.' Using the phrase 'with due\nregard to the right to life of the\nmother', the judges argued that as\nthere was a strong possibility of the\ngirl committing suicide, then the\nright to life of the child was\nthreatened by both having and not\nhaving an abortion, but the right to\nlife of the mother was threatened\nonly by not having the abortion. On\nthese grounds, the girl could have\nthe abortion in Ireland. This\nopened the way to abortion in\nIreland under limited conditions.\nThe second section of the\njudgement stated that the right to\nlife of the child under the Irish\nconstitution was greater than the\nright to travel. Thus, the girl could\nnot travel to Britain for her\nabortion, and she already could not\nbe told that abortion services were\navailable, or what these services\nentailed. She could, of course, be\ntold all this about abortion services\nThey completely missed the double\nirony that abortion in Ireland was\nnow legal under the very\namendment that they constructed to\nban abortion, and that the legality\nof abortions was to be copper-fastened by the Maastricht protocol\nclause that they insisted be inserted\nto prevent the European community\nfrom 'imposing' abortion on 'poor,\nsweet, innocent Ireland'. The salt\nwas firmly rubbed as the whole\ncontroversy, and undermining of\nthe pro-life, anti-abortion position,\nhad started with the type of case that\npro-life, anti-abortion campaigners\nsmoothly and smugly said could\nnever happen, when the appalling\nspectre of abortion after rape was\nraised in 1983.\nAnti-abortionists have also failed\nto draft a text for a new antiabortion referendum. Given that the\nprevious form of words gave\nequality to the lives of the mother\ninformation in the constitution. This\nleft Ireland facing two, possibly\nthree separate referenda. One or\ntwo abortion based ones, either\ncompletely outlawing abortion in\nhowever draconian a manner, or\nestablishing travel/information\nrights, and another on Maastricht\nratification. The question was,\nwhich referendum was to come\nfirst.\nThe Irish government, now led\nby Albert Reynolds, who became\nTaoiseach after the resignation of\nCharles Haughey at the end of\nJanuary 92, said that the Maastricht\ndebate was to come first. This\ndecision was arrived at after a botched attempt to change the\nprotocol, and not without\nconsiderable confusion. The junior\npartner in the Irish coalition\ngovernment, the Progressive\nDemocrats, favoured having an\nabortion referendum first. This\nReynolds was loath to do. He\ndesperately wanted to avoid a divisive referendum either about or\nbefore Maastricht, and wanted to\ncarry the majority of the population\nwith him on Maastricht. This he\nwould not be able to do if the\nMaastricht issue became seriously\nclouded with the abortion issue.\nReynolds was assuming that, with\nabortion shoved under the mat for\na while, he could bank on the\nextensive pro-Europe outlook of\nIreland to get Maastricht through.\nHe was well aware of the\nconsequences if he failed in this,\nsomething now clearly evident by\nthe Danish decision to reject\nratification. Indeed, the Danish vote\ncould now make the Irish debate\nentirely superfluous.\nIt did not take long for the\ninterested parties to line up on either\nside of the Maastricht debate. In\nthe Catholic\nChurch may be\nsaving its\nammunition for\nthe abortion\ndebate\nfavour of ratification were all of the\nmajor political parties; Fianna Fail,\nFine Gael, Labour (bar two MPs)\nand the Progressive Democrats, all\nfor different reasons. Trade Unions,\nFarmers' Groups and the\nFederation of Irish Employers are\nalso in favour. Against ratification\nare the fledgling Democratic Left,\nand what remains of the (Stalinist)\nWorkers' Party. Both these groups\nare on the left of the political\nspectrum. Also against are the pro-life, anti-abortion group, and\nwomen's rights groups, for the\nreasons explained above. A significant addition to the 'nays' is\nSenator Des Hanafin, who has now\nhad the Fianna Fail whip withdrawn\nfrom him. Senator Hanafin\nspearheaded the 1983 referendum,\nand played a major role in the\ninsertion of the Maastricht protocol\nclause.\nThe group of interest to everyone\nwas the Catholic Church. Which\nway would the prelates jump? An\ninteresting straw in the wind was the\ndecision by the Irish farmers'\ngroups to support Maastricht\nratification. Even though it was\ntheir support for Europe, and\nindeed the financial benefits they\nderive from the Common\nAgricultural Policy (CAP), that\nallowed the ratification of the 1987\nSingle European Act to romp home\nwith a70% vote, it was also the\nrural vote that swung the 1983 anti-\n"

    "content": "5 June 1992 Felix 937 Feature\ncampaigners increasing feared that\nthe legislature might allow abortion\nin limited circumstances. To resolve\nthe issue for once and for all, they\ndecided to act to constitutionally ban\nabortion in Ireland. Des Hanafin, a senator for Ireland's largest political\nparty, Fianna Fail, and a trustee of\nthe pro-life, anti-abortion\ncampaign, said 'henceforth,\nabortion cannot be introduced into\nIreland by court, or legislature, but\nonly if the majority of Irish people\nchoose to do so in a referendum.\nThis is pure democracy.'\nDuring the campaign, the\nCatholic church in Ireland\nflagrantly abused its position of\nresponsibility. Sunday after Sunday\npriests and bishops told the\ncongregation from the pulpit how\nto vote. The Fianna Fail party, then\nin opposition, played electoral silly\nbeggars with the wording of the\nreferendum, acting purely out of\nparty political expediency. A debate\nwhich had begun to start on\nabortion was stifled, then repressed\nby the din, and the lies, and the\nblack propaganda of the pro-life,\nanti-abortion lobby.\nThe 1983 anti abortion\nconstitutional amendment was\npassed by 67% of the population,\nand created a suffocating and\nretarding shame as its consequences\ns limed from under the carpet. The\nreactionary, conservative,\nrepressive elements that had formed\nan savage alliance in 1983 now\nbecame a predatory presence,\nsweeping and demolishing any\npossibility of reform, of intelligent\nthought, of freedom. Marital\nreform, rights to abortion\ninformation, rights to travel were\nsummarily executed by ideological\nthug ger y. Relief began to be personified in\nMary Robinson, a liberal lawyer\nwho had fought in the European\ncourt for Irish women to at least\nhave the right to information on\nabortion. In October 1990, Mary\nRobinson was elected Irish\nPresident in the biggest electoral\nupset since the foundation of the\nstate. Her election was seen as a maturing experience, an exorcising\nof guilt, of the women of Ireland,\nm nd na hE ireann, not rocking the\ncradle, but rocking the system. In\nthe last month of the campaign, she\nwas told by two bible-clutching\nelderly women outside a Catholic\nchurch in Ballina, 'we voted against\nabortion and divorce, and we're\nashamed we did. We're going to\nvote for you.'\nThe new liberalism was short\nlived. The largest party in Ireland's coalition government, Fianna Fail,\ntried a brief courtship with the post\nRobinson agenda. In March 1991,\nthe then Irish Prime Minister\n(Taoiseach), Charles Haughey,\ncasually announced that condoms\nwould be made available from\nplaces other than chemists, and that\nthey could be available to those over\n16. Some of Haughey's party\nmembers, the bedrock of Irish\nConservatism, were shocked.\nHaughey supporters were\ndismissive of their concern. 'Fuck\nthem. They have nowhere else to\ngo,' said one. Then Ireland's bishops waded in. 'No political\nparty in this country is prepared to\ndefend fundamental values of\nfamily life,' thundered the\nArchbishop of Dublin. The plan\nwas dropped.\ndecision, the Irish Times led with\nMartyn Turner's cartoon captioned,\n'17 February 1992. The\nintroduction of internment in\nIreland for 14 year old girls.'\nThe X case had several\nimmediate implications. The most\nhuman was the suffering of the 14\nyear old, and the possibility of her\ncommitting suicide. A death in\nthese circumstances would not have\nbeen unusual. In 1984, 14 year old\nAnn Lovett bled to death beside the\nstatue of the Virgin Mary as she\ngave birth to her baby. The dead\nbaby was still attached by its\numbilical cord when its mother's body was eventually found in the\nHi Eleven months later, the\nobscenity of Ireland's national\nhypocrisy on morality reemerged.\nThe Irish Attorney General, acting\nunder the 1983 amendment to the\nIrish constitution, sought an\ninjunction in the district court\nagainst a woman travelling to\nBritain for an abortion. What\ndistinguished this woman from the\n40,000 others who travel freely a year was that she went to the Irish\npolice (Gardaf) to provide a sample\nof the foetal tissue. X was a rape\nvictim, and she was fourteen years\nof age.\n. The case of X trauma tis ed the\npopulation, and the upholding of the\noriginal injunction, including the\nban on travel, in the Irish High\ncourt caused outrage in sections of\npublic opinion. The day after the\nchurch, her school bag close by. It\nis unlikely that this is one of the\nformaldehyde imprisoned foetuses\nused by SPUC for sex education in\nIrish schools.\nOther implications were of a European dimension. The ban on\nthe girl travelling to Britain for an\nabortion seemed to be a direct\ncontravention on the right to travel\nunder the Treaty of Rome, the\ntreaty that started the EC. Also, as\nshe was banned not for where she\nwas travelling to, but for why she\nwas travelling, the Irish courts\nseemed to be deciding what the girl\ncould do in a foreign country. This\nwas the Irish constitution conferring\non Irish courts the rights of\nextraterritorial jurisdiction.\nThe most significant implication\nof the case was that it highlighted\nhow European law had been altered\nto accommodate Ireland's abortion\nlaws. Under the Maastricht treaty,\nsigned by all European countries in\nDecember 1991, abortion was\nconsidered as a 'service'. Thus,\nunder European law, Irish women\nwould be able to avail of abortions\nin other countries, completely\nlegally and above board. Despite\nthe fact that thousands of Irish\nwomen go abroad for abortions\nanyway, this Maastricht provision\nflatly contradicted the Irish\nconstitutional position. Under Irish\nlaw, travelling abroad for an\nabortion is illegal. But, as Ireland\nhad already approved the Single\nEuropean Act in a referendum in\n1987, European law took\nprecedence over Irish law, so once\nMaastricht was ratified, overseas\nabortions would be legal for Irish\nwomen. This would have caused\nsevere political difficulties when the\ntime came for Maastricht to be\nratified by Ireland. (Maastricht had\nto be ratified by referendum as it\naffected Ireland's sovereignty.) Prolife, anti-abortion campaigners\nrights to travel\nwere summarily\nexecuted by\nideological\nthug ger y would have claimed that Maastricht\nequalled back door abortions for\nIreland.\nThis particular problem was\napparently circumvented by the\ninsertion of a clause in the protocol\nto the Maastricht agreement. The\nclause, negotiated by Irish premier\nHaughey after being approached by\nDes Hanafin, was to serve as an\nelectric fence around the Irish\nconstitutional ban on abortion. The\nclause said simply that European\nlaw would not affect the Irish\nconstitutional position on abortion,\nas amended in 1983 or in\nsubsequent amendments. Thus, the\nIrish constitutional position was\nbeyond impeachment. The case of\nX brought this rather\ninconsequential clause in the\nprotocol into stunning focus. At that\ntime, if the right to the abortion had\nbeen refused to the girl by Ireland's highest courts, then she would have\nhad recourse to the European court.\nHad her case occurred after\nratification of Maastricht, then she\ncould not have appealed to Europe,\nas the constitutional position could\nno longer be affected by European\nlaw.\n\n"

'\n'If a nun is raped, she must have\nthe child.' This is the voice of Irish\nCatholic values, as articulated by\nMary Lucey, of the pro-life, antiabortion Society for the Protection\nof the Unborn Child (SPUC). It is\nalso the voice of what has become\nIreland's hypocrisy, for Mary\nLucey adds, 'if a woman is raped,\nshe is entitled to the morning after\npill.'\nIreland's organised hypocrisy.\nThe hypocrisy of a celibate church\nwhere a senior cleric fathers and\ndisowns a child. The hypocrisy of\na people which apparently ban\nabortion in a constitutional\nreferendum, yet ignore the plight of\n40,000 Irish women who travel to\nBritain each year for termination.\nThe hypocrisy of a nation which\nframes and jails the mother of a still\nborn baby for murder, and which\nthis year barred a fourteen year old\nrape victim from travelling to\nBritain for an abortion.\nFor many years, abortion was\none of many subjects that Ireland\ndid not, dare not discuss. Abortion\nwas illegal both in moral and civil\nlaw. The Catholic Church decreed\nthat abortion was mortal sin. The\n1861 Offences Against The Person\nAct ensured that the church's will\nwas done. When Eamonn de Valera\ndrew up the new constitution for the\nfledgling state of Eire in 1937, he\nhad sufficient consultation with the\nbishops to ensure that what was not\non the church's agenda was off the\nconstitutional agenda. Marital\nseparation, divorce, contraception,\nabortion were all banned in the\nnew, free, pluralistic society.\nCracks in the moral veneer\nappeared in 1973, when the ban on\nthe use of contraceptives was\nbreached. In the McGee case, the\nIrish Supreme Court decided that\nunder the constitutional right to\nprivacy, a married couple was able\nto import contraceptives for their\nown personal use. What alarmed\nIrish pro-life, anti-abortion\ncampaigners was that this was the\nsame reasoning used that year by\nthe United States Supreme Court in\nthe Roe V Wade case, which led to\nthe federal legal is ation of abortion\nin the United States.\nWith a trickle of liberalisation\npermeating through the Irish\npsyche, pro-life, anti-abortion\n\u2014 4 \u2014\n\n"

WmmmmmmMm\nW^ mmm mmm km m41 Dr Elizabeth Johnson, a physicist at Imperial College and Co-or d in at or of the 'Daphne Jackson Memorial Fellowships Trust' told Felix this\nweek that women were poorly represented on academic staff at IC. 'The percentage of women goes down as one goes up in rank' she said.\nThe Daphne Jackson Trust assists female scientists return to work after a career break.\nCar Park Privatised without Consultation\nImperial College trade unions have\nreacted with fury to plans to\nprivat is e the College car parking\nservice. Mick Saul, of the National\nUnion of Public Employees\n(NUPE), said that the unions had\nnot been consulted on the plans. Ian\nFrench, of the Manufacturing\nScience and Finance Union (MSF),\nsaid that he thought the College\nwould have learned how to conduct\nindustrial relations after the\n\"trauma' of the Messenger, Security\nand Car Parking dispute earlier this\nyear.\nThe proposal is detailed in a paper produced by the College\nManagement and Planning Group\n(MPG) meeting of 14 May. Headed\n'Contracting Out of South\nKensington Car Park\nManagement,' it recommends the\nprivatisation of the service on the\nbasis of the arguments presented in\ntwo papers submitted to MPG meetings on 11 July 1991 and 9\nApril 1992. The paper also\nannounces that a tender has been\nawarded to Axess Management Ltd,\nwho will take up management of the\ncar park on 29 June.\nSpeaking to j 'CNN, Val Straw, IC\nFacilities Manager, said that car\nparking staff will return to normal\nsecurity duties when the new\nmanagement team takes over. She\nadded that she didn't think that there\nwould be any major problems in\ninstalling the regime. The proposal\nhas yet to be passed by Sir Eric\nAsh, IC Rector, and the College\nGoverning Body.\nWhen asked if any consultations\nhad taken place on the privatisation,\nMs Straw demanded to know who\nshould be consulted. Sir Eric said\nthat as far as he knew, the trade\nunions had already been consulted\nat this stage, something Ms Straw\ndid not deny. Last night, trade\nunion spokesmen completely\ncontradicted this.\nMr French said that he would be\nvery angry if these proposals were\nto be implemented without\nconsultation. He said that as the\nmatter had been considered by the\nCollege Parking Committee, on\nwhich both Ms Straw and the trade\nunions sit, then Ms Straw had ample\nopportunity to inform unions of any\nawarding of tenders. He added that\nthe unions had been relying on\nrumour and guesswork up to this\npoint.\nThe proposal to privat is e the car\npark has been under consideration\nsince the resolution of the\nMessenger, Security and Car\nParking dispute. At the time, the\nGoverning Body decided that the\ncar park should be considered\nseparately from the rest of the\nsecurity and messenger system. The\nParking Committee was set up to\nenable this to occur.\nThe car park discussions have\nbeen based on a report produced by\nindependent consultants. The report\nwas apparently exploring ways to\nmaximise the \u00a380,000 annual profit\nthe car park currently makes. At the\ntime of the dispute, Estates\nDirector, Gordon Marshall, is\nreported to have said that the car\npark just broke even. Mr Marshall\nwas unavailable for comment\nyesterday, and was apparently not\nin the college. Mr French wanted\nto know why the consultants' report\nhas not been openly circulated. He\nalso asked for the brief for the\nconsultants to be released.\nMs Straw confirmed the\nappointment of a college fire officer\nlast week. She said that the officer,\nas yet unnamed, had a wide\nbackground in the field of fire safety\nand is a former fire brigade officer.\nThe officer will oversee the drafting\nand implementation of a new fire\nsafety policy and the impending\nupgrade of fire alarms. Ms Straw\nrefused to deny that the contract for\nthe fire alarm upgrade would be\nawarded to the company contracted\nby London Weekend Television for\nthe same work. The fire company\n'may well have done work' for\nLW T, she said.\nFelix Bound Editions 91/92 will cost \u00a332.

The\nSports Centre changes will be\nfunded by an interest free loan of\n\u00a3650,000 to be repaid in twelve\nyears time. The Union will lose\nmoney on the interest raised on the\nfund, which was as much as\n\u00a3300,000 last year.\nZoe Hellinger, ICU President,\nsaid that she and the other trustees\nof the Harlington trust believed that\nthe money would benefit students:\nThey believed an improved Sports\nCentre would attract better students\nand provide improved sports\nfacilities.\nComplaints have also been raised\nover the closure of the whole sports\nInvestigations are continuing after\nthe theft of several items, including\n\u00a3950 in cash, from rooms in\nSouthside Halls over two weeks\nago.\nThe thefts are be lei ved to have\noccurred during or shortly after the\nhall's windows had been cleaned as\nafterwards it was noticed that\nseveral rooms had been left\nunlocked and the contents had been\ndisturbed. The thefts are still being\ninvestigated by the Police.\nAny company that is allowed into\nHalls is normally vetted by College\nsecurity. Reports reaching Felix\nsuggest that the company employed\ncentre over the first term of the next\nacademic year. Ms Osner said that\narrangements were being made with\nthe University of London Union and\nSt Mary's to house some of IC's sporting facilities during the\nclosure. She told Zoe Hellinger that\na fund would be raised to help pay\nfor any extra travelling costs\nincurred. Other sports centres in\nKensington, Westminster, Chelsea\nand Wandsworth would\naccommodate Imperial students at\nreduced prices. Ms Osner expressed\nregret at closure but said it was\n'unavoidable.'\nMs Osner continued that the\nchanges had been agreed with the\nwidest consultation possible and that\nthe changes to the sports centre\nwould be in the best interests of\nstudents now and in the future. The\nsports centre will close on the 16th August and reopen on 2nd January\n1993 following an extensive\nmarketing campaign.\nto clean windows may have subcontracted the work to a third party\nwhich avoided security checks.\nThe student who had \u00a3950 stolen\nis believed to have had the money\nin her room for up to ten days. Zoe\nHellinger, Imperial College Union\nPresident, said she was 'very angry'\nover this lapse of security and added\nthat any student who took 'adequate\nprovisions' by locking their rooms\nshould be entitled to some help from\nCollege in this type of situation.\nSir Eric Ash, IC Rector, said the\nsituation was difficult as the College\nwas not responsible for all student\nrooms, but said he would\ninvestigate the matter personally.\nProfessor Eric Brown has resigned\nas conductor of Imperial College\nChoir, ending a career which\nspanned about forty years. The\nresignation was announced just\nbefore the choir's concert in the\nGreat Hall last Friday evening, and\ncomes after a dispute between the\nconductor and the choir's senior\ntreasurer, Malcolm Aldridge.\nThe Choir chairman, Phil Pratt,\nrecently issued a letter withdrawing\nMr Aldridge's membership of the\nchoir, following what has been\nreported as an attempt by Mr Aldridge to force Professor Brown\nfrom the conductor ship. The move by Mr Pratt to\nwithdraw Mr Aldridge's membership was unconstitutional,\nand has been withdrawn. Imperial\nCollege Choir is a Union society\nand membership must remain open\nLibraries Merge\nThe work on merging the Imperial\nCollege central libraries and the\nScience Museum libraries will take\nplace over the Summer Vacation.\nThe combined libraries will have\none entrance, a single issue desk\nand a reference desk. It is also\nproposed to move the Haldane\nLibrary to the ground floor of the\nnew building.\nMr Richard Hall, Reader\nServices Sub-Librarian, told Felix\nthat the library would only be closed\nfor up to 3 or 4 days during the\nSummer holiday while the serious\nwork is done. He added that\nalthough some noise would be\nunavoidable during the merger, the\neffect on Postgraduates and students\nstudying for retakes would be small.\nto all Union members, including Mr Aldridge who is a life member of\nthe Union.\nSpeaking to (CNN, Mr Aldridge\nsaid that he was still 'nominally\nsenior treasurer' of the Choir. He\nconfirmed that he had received the\nletter from the chairman\nwithdrawing his membership and\nthat he was now waiting to see what\nthe committee would decide on the\nmatter. He added that he would\nconcur with any decision made\nabout his membership.\nEric Brown was a professor of\nCivil Engineering at Imperial until\nhis retirement two years ago. Sir\nEric Ash, IC Rector, told / CNN that Professor Brown was 'an\nabsolutely marvellous source of\nstrength for music in the college.\nHe was an extraordinarily talented\nand devoted conductor.'\nMr Hall said work on the libraries\nwould continue for the next two\nyears but the major work should be\ncompleted before the next academic\nyear begins. Mr Hall emphasised\nthat the company that wins the\ncontract to meld the two libraries\nwould have to guarantee to\ncomplete the work over the\nsummer.\nSir Eric Ash, IC Rector,\ncommented that the merger was\nsomething he had 'fought for, for\na long time.' Sir Eric continued that\nany student affected by the building\nwork should take into account the\nwide range of departmental\nLibraries that Imperial possesses\nwhich rival other Universities in the\ncountry.\nCash Theft from Hall\nStudents and Sabbaticals vote for Gardens Closure\nThe 'Gardens' Restaurant in\nSouthside will close completely by\nthe end of the term if a proposal\ncirculated by catering manager\nSimon Westerman is passed by\nCollege. The proposal was passed\nby the College Bar and Catering\nCommittee on 21 May. It will be\nconsidered by College House\nCommittee on 9th June, and by the\nCollege Management Planning\nGroup (MPG) on 2nd July. The\nMPG will then advise the Rector\nand the decision making Governing\nBody.\nThe Bar and Catering Committee\n'endorsed the view that there could\nbe no justification in continuing\nwith any form of service within the\nGardens Restaurant in Southside\nand recommend it should cease\ntrading at the end of the present\nterm.' The proposal was passed on\nthe grounds that the losses incurred\nby the restaurant were\nunsustainable. The two sabbatical\nofficers present at the meeting, Zoe\nHellinger and Steve Farrant, were\nalso in favour of closing the\nGardens.\nIn addition to his papers to Bar\nand Catering, Mr Westerman has\nprepared a paper for the College\nHouse Committee meeting. He\ndescribes Gardens as always having\nbeen 'a drain on Catering's resources, with a projected deficit\nof \u00a3180,000 for 1992. This is a completely unsustainable situation.'\nCatering Department Trading\nAccount figures for the nine months\nto 30th April 1992 show that\nGardens made a loss of \u00a3143,402,\nwhile the Sherfield Senior Common\nRoom and Main Dining Hall made\na combined loss of \u00a3192,076.\nAdministration cost the Catering\nDepartment \u00a3293,645 in the nine\nmonth period.\nThe House and Catering\nCommittee decision to completely\nclose Gardens follows a consultation exercise on proposals\nto close Gardens at weekends and\nevenings only. 708 questionnaires\nwere circulated to student users,\nand 121 (17%) were returned. One\nhundred questionnaires were burnt.\nThe results of the survey were that\n95% of the 17% would not be\nadversely affected if the weekend\nlunch service were to stop, and that\n93% of the 17% would not be\nadversely affected by the cessation\nof the evening service.\nSpeaking to / CNN yesterday\nafternoon, Mr Westerman said he\n'did not know' if another\nquestionnaire on the complete\nclosure was to be issued to students.\nHe added in his defence that\n'student representation was 100%\nin favour' at the Bar and Catering\nCommittee. Following last week's Felix article on the closure of\nGardens, he said that staff had now\nbeen notified of the proposal. He\nadded that staff would not have been\nnotified of the proposal had the\nFelix article not appeared. A new\nconsultation document on the\nproposal will be issued within the\nnext 24 hours.\nThe House and Catering\nCommittee also approved the\nclosure of Southside bar in its\npresent form and the movement of\nthe bar to the Sherfield building.\nThe proposed move was prompted\nby 'rowdiness, isolated incidents of\nviolence, glasses and litter in\nPrinces Gardens and noise pollution\nfor the neighbouring community.'\nThe paper also proposed moving\nBelushi's to Sherfield. Mr Westerman said that none of these\nproposals would be implemented\nuntil the 'Catering account moves\nfrom red to black.'\nFelix is produced for and behalf of the Imperial College Union Publications Board and is printed by the Imperial College Union Print Unit, Prince Consort Road.\nLondon SW7 2BB.( Tel: 071-225 8672).

    "content": "5 June 1992 Felix 937 Clubs & Societies\n'Pistol Anno Domini' is an event\nwhich attracts 20,000 people, no\npolice, loads of blasters and no\ncrime. It is a sanctuary for the\ncivilised society. You can leave\nyour car open, your bag lying\naround without the fear of anything\nbeing stolen. The National Pistol\nAssociations Pistol AD, that is\nPistol '92 this year, held at Bisley\nCamp in Surrey, is the largest pistol\nmeeting in the world attracting 1000\ncompetitors shooting over five\ndays. Since shooting is the second\nlargest participatory sport in the\ncountry (after fishing) one wonders\nwhy there was little or no mention\nof it in the media.\nAmongst other things, Pistol AD provides the impetus for a band of\nmole like creatures to crawl out of\ntheir dim, dusty, subterranean home\nand expose their cannons to the\nelements. The main objective of the\nmoles, known as the Imperial B Team, was to defend the Howe\nCup. This task should have fallen\nto the A Team, though due to\n300 yards. The 100 yard stage is\ntwo strings of five shots, each done\nin 30 seconds. It is a test of nerve.\nAt the extended ranges the\nammunition (all home brewed) and\nits interaction with the wind\nbecomes more significant. To give\none more time to puzzle over the\nnature of the distribution, imagine\nthe area around the central black\ntarget to be the size of doughnut\nwhich you have hit with 10 shots in\n10 minutes.\nThe pistols used (actually\nrevolvers) must be 'out of the box'\nfrom a mass producer. The calibre\nof choice is a.357 Magnum, using\na heavy bullet spat with a8 inch\nbarrel. The Imperial team were\nsupposed to be equipped with at\nleast one such revolver. However,\ndue to a snarl up in the equipment\nprocurement programme,\nattributable to the current executive,\naka the A Team, the B Team were\nlimited to 6 inch barrels. In\nshooting, size is everything. Those\nextra two inches offered increased\nat 300 yards, together with his\nearlier scores of 41/50 and 43/50,\nto finish on 130/150. This was\nenough to give him fourth place in\nthe Allcomers B section - no glass,\nbut a medallion plus a gold hat\nbadge thingy. PG Deeks, the third\nand final member of Imperial B, started with solid scores of 40/50\nand 40/50 only to fall victim of the\nwind later in the day with a25/50 score at 300 yards. However,\nDeekUs 105/150 was sufficient to\nclearly beat Oxford's highest\nindividual score.\nOxford's final scores only\nhighlight the dominance which IC\nnow enjoy, with final placings in the\nregion of 17, 48 and 82. We are not\nsure about the scores and names, so\nwe shall not include the names for\nfear of libel.\nHurr also shot Sport Pistolfinishing 8th overall, and received\na little bronze badge to add to his\ngold one. He also wanted even\nmore space dedicated to him\nbecause he provided transport -bizarre team tactics, they decided\nnot to turn up. To adequately\ndescribe them would necessitate a digression from the Queen's English. For the purposes of this\nreport they could be described by\na four letter word that described the\nbrown dog that was jumped over by\nthe quick fox - followed by gits.\nThe Howe Cup is an inter-university cup for long range pistol\nshooting. The university used to\nmean Oxford - who were the only\nones to know of the cup's existence.\nBut since the IC Rifle & Pistol Club\nfound out about it, the cup reads\n'Imperial, Imperial, Imperial,\nImperial.'\nLong range pistol is shot over\ndistances of 100, 200 and finally\nmuzzle velocity, reduced recoil,\nand increased sight radius.\nAC Jones shooting for IC had\nplenty of nerve for the 100 yard\nstage scoring 44/50, followed-by a200 yard score of 48/50 which put\nhim within three points of the\noverall lead. Thinking of lunch and\nglory (in that order) he suffered\nfrom severe wind and inferior\nballistics at 300 yards finishing with\na34/50 for a total score of 126/150.\nThis was sufficient for him to take\nfirst place in the Allcomers C section and get some glass wear -plus a little gold thingy and a medallion. CJ Hurr, who stayed\nwell clear of the beef burgers at\nlunch, took advantage of a lull in\nthe wind to score an excellent 46/50\nwhich was invaluable both for the\nbig event and the warm up London\n& Middlesex Rifle Association\nOpen, where Jones won another\ncup, and also for the practise\nsessions. Hurr also made the 'flying\nmachine' (a combined seat and\npistol rest) that is an absolute must\nfor serious posing and shooting.\nOur treasurer, Robert Hambleton\n(the only member of the executive\nwho actually does anything), must\nalso be thanked. This years long\nrange escapade cost about \u00a3500.\nRob is forever greeted with a 'Oh\nRob, here's another receipt, can\nyou do something with it?' The\nanswer to this question usually\nresults in a yes, which fortunately\nmeans that some cash comes back.\nCredits\nDeclan, the Stefs, Steve, Poddy,\nCatherine, Sam, Rose, Jonty, Ian,\nSimon, Marge, the Davids,\nKhurrum, Martyn Turner, James,\nZoe, Toby, John Simpson, Scott,\nAndy, the airborne aquarius and the\naesthetic myth.\n\u2014 3 \u2014\n\n"

The\nNeanderthal of old used to club his\nwife with a bone and rape his\nneighbour's daughter - nowadays\nthe Neanderthal bar fly lech es through a drunken stupor at\nanything in a skirt, even if it is\nmerely a picture of a hovercraft.\nAnd you should not be so\ncomplacent as to think such serious\ninjustices only took place in the dim\nand distant past - it was only\nrecently that an English court ruled\nthat rape within marriage could\nactually legally occur.\nSexual harassment causes\nsuffering; the victims may endure\nanything from embarrassment to\nanger, from fear to depression.\nThey may be driven to leave their\njob or course; their mental health\nmay be damaged and they may feel\ndemeaned or isolated. It is not\nanybody's position to judge the\nrectitude of the victim's response -it is the prerogative of any citizen\nof a civilised country to try to help\nsomebody in pain and to attempt to\navoid such situations occurring in\nfuture. To this end Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) has formulated a policy on sexual harassment, the\ncomplete wording of which can be\nobtained from the Union or Felix\nOffices. The final proposal is to be\nput to the Unions Annual General\nMeeting on 23 June this year - any\nsuggestions concerning the policy\nshould be made to Zoe Hellinger\n(Union President, on 3501) by\nWednesday 17 June.\nThe Union takes the issue of\nsexual harassment very seriously\nand believes that it can be grounds\nfor disciplinary action. Ms\nHellinger has also noted that 'it\nwould also be beneficial if the\npolicy could be incorporated into\nthe College regulations.' Many\nother Student Unions around the\ncountry already have a standing on\nthis issue - to various effects.\nPerhaps it is time that ICU should\nrecognise and deal with this issue.\nThe Working Definition of Sexual\nHarassment\nAny doubt as to what defines sexual\nharassment should not deter\nabout\ndistress.\nLikewise, any intimation that\ncomplaint will cause embarrassment\nshould not be entertained - the\nUnion respects the sensitivity of the\nissue and respects the necessity for\ncomplete confidentiality.\nHarassment can take many forms\nand can be directed against women,\nethnic minorities, those of physical\nor mental disabilities and those of\ndifferent sexual orientations or\nages. ICU defines sexual\nharassment as 'repeated and\nunwanted verbal or sexual\nWhat can be\nharmless fun for\none can be\nperceived as\nhostile and\nintimidating by\nthe other.\nadvances,' or in fact any action\nwhich causes distress to a person\nthrough physical contact, sexually\nexplicit remarks or the display of\nsexually explicit material. It should\nbe made clear that any behaviour\nthat can make an individual feel\n'un justifiably' viewed as a sex\nobject may cause offence, even if\nthis is not intended. Differences in\nculture or attitude - or even alcohol\nconsumption - can result in the\nmisinterpretation of social signals\nsuch that what is perceived as\nharmless fun by one party can result\nin a hostile and intimidating\nenvironment for the other.\nAlthough it is conceded that\nsexual harassment can be\nexperienced by both sexes, in the\nvast majority of cases it is inflicted\non women through the deliberate\nand unwelcome attentions of men.\nSuch behaviour can, under some\ncircumstances, be illegal under the\nSex Discrimination Act or the Race\nRelations Act.\nThe Aims of the Policy\nIn order that the College's students\nand staff can enjoy the Union in a harassment-free environment,\nwhere the dignity of individuals is\nrespected, the Union seeks to\nprohibit sexual harassment on its\npremises.\nWhat Should Harassment Victims\nDo?\nThe first step is to attempt to make\nit clear to the offender that such\nbehaviour is unwelcome, but if you\nfeel you cannot do this, this\nconstitutes neither consent to\n\n"

    "content": "5 June 1992 Felix 937 Feature\nabortion referendum in favour of\nthe pro-life groups with a67% vote.\nDid their support for Maastricht\nindicate that the influence of the\nChurch on matters of state was on\nthe wane? Thanks to Bishop Casey,\nthe answer can only be guessed at,\nthough his case shows that the\nChurch's influence on moral\nmatters is now being treated with a bit more cynicism than before.\nThe Casey factor may indeed\nhave affected the eventual Church\ndecision, though senior\ncorrespondents suggest that the\nChurch position is more due to\ngenuine confusion. They were\ncaught between supporting\nMaastricht, and in effect supporting\nlimited abortion in Ireland, or\nrejecting Maastricht, and\nsabotaging the financial state of the\nnation, considering that Ireland\nhugely depends on the CAP and on\nthe regional and social funding\n(ERDF, ESDF) it receives from the\nEC. In the event, the Church advised\nto neither accept or reject, ignored\nthe substance of Maastricht entirely,\nand called for an abortion\nreferendum. Showing a slight\ninclination to the extremists in the\npro-life anti-abortion parties, their\nsoul mates from 1983, the Church\nspokesman, Bishop Joseph Duffy\nsaid in reference to the holding an\nthe Maastricht\nprotocol\n'imposed'\nabortion on\n'poor, sweet\ninnocent\nIreland'\nabortion referendum, 'this would be\none of Ireland's most distinctive\ncontributions to the soul of Europe.'\nThe pro-Maastricht parties now\nforged ahead with their yes\ncampaign. The Church was\neffectively neutral is ed, and\nReynolds went full hog to isolate\nwhat he regarded as the remaining\nextremists. He played strongly on\nthe financial gains Ireland has made\nfrom the European Community. As\nIreland is on the periphery of\nEurope ,a large claim will be\navailable from the 'Cohesion\nFund,' set up to counter the effects\nof the 'Golden Triangle' of the\nfinancial centres of London,\nFrankfurt and Milan. While no cash\nis on the table for the fund, the\ncarrot waved by Reynolds is in the\norder of magnitude of six billion\npounds over five years. This money\nis in addition to the money already\npromised under the agricultural\npolicy, the social fund, and the\nregional development fund. In the\ndebate on the Maastricht\nreferendum, Reynolds told the Irish\nparliament, 'Any suggestion that\nIreland will not be a full member\nin future of the Single Market and\nof the Union would cause a major\nloss in investment confidence with\ndevastating consequences for jobs.'\nNow all has changed. The\ndecision by the Danish people to\nreject the Maastricht treaty has\nevened the scales, and both the\nMaastricht and the abortion\nbattlegrounds have been redrawn.\nThe anti-Maastricht parties are\nclaiming not so much victory,\nrather that the referendum is over\nbefore it even began. 'It's a dead\nduck,' said one spokesman just\nhours after the result of the\nDenmark vote was announced. The\nIrish government were described by\na reporter on the Irish Press as\n'headless chickens', and officially,\nthe Taoiseach's office would only\nsay that they were 'making\nconsultations.'\nThe Danish decision has opened\n\\tp several interesting possibilities.\nAs the treaty looks certain to be\nrenegotiated, there is the option of\nthe removal of the clause in the\nprotocol. This would leave Irish\nwomen able to travel abroad to avail\nof the abortion 'service', as well as\nbeing able to have abortions in\nIreland so long as there is a threat\nto the life of the mother. Whatever\nhappens, the debate will have to\nreturn to a referendum on abortion.\nA referendum had been planned on\nthe right to information in\nNovember. This may be added to\nby a total review of the abortion\nlaw.\nBefore this is to be considered,\nthe Government must also clear\nthree pieces of legislation already\npromised, and the progress to date\ndoes not bode well for abortion\nreform. A White Paper on marital\nbreakdown and divorce was due to\nbe debated in the Irish parliament\nbefore the summer, but has now\napparently been 'shelved'.\nTaoiseach Reynolds had promised\nlegislation this year to de criminal is e homosexuality, after being\ninstructed to do so by the European\ncommunity. This is now unlikely to\nhappen until 1993. The new family\nplanning bill, following on from the\n1991 Haughey proposals, has now\nsunk, apparently without trace.\nThat the Government's timetable\nfor piecemeal reform has been\nscuppered by the Danish vote is\nbeyond doubt. It will now have to\ncontend with are negotiation of\nMaastricht, under a more constant\npublic gaze than existed before. It\nwill also have to deal with the\nabortion issues post Maastricht. A lot will depend on how much Albert\nReynolds thinks he needs the liberal\nvote to give him the overall majority\nthat has escaped his party for the\npast five elections.\nA minor worry is that, should\nattempts be made to\nconstitutional is e abortion, the anti-abortion, pro-life campaign may\nstand in parliamentary\nconstituencies against Fianna Fail.\nOf more immediate concern, the\nIrish government believes that the\nCatholic Church is saving its heavy\nammunition for the upcoming\nabortion debate, post Maastricht.\nThe church is already preparing its\nagenda, its plans to turn back the\nclock, to be dogmatic, oppressive,\ninsensitive. On line is complete\nprohibition of abortion, restrictions\nin the right to travel, and the\ncomplete abolition of the right to\ninformation. Nothing would be a clearer signal that the church, and\nits militant, fundamental extremists\nin the pro-life group, have learned\nnothing. They have not learned\nrespect, tolerance or pluralism. As\nsuch, they should accept that they\nhave been, and remain a significant\nretarding factor in the development\nof a modern Irish society, that their\nagenda will keep the Irish people in\nan infantile morality, and that they\nwill continue to foster a culture of\nstupidity. But whatever the weight\nof the church's artillery, they may\nlearn painfully that the public mood\nhas changed, that their reputation\nhas been damaged, and that there\nis a possibility that the power to\ndecide the nation's policy may\nfinally be wrested from them.\n14 year old Ann\nLovett bled to\ndeath beside a statue of the\nVirgin Mary.\nThe dead baby\nwas still\nattached by its\numbilical cord\nwhen its\nmother's body\nwas found -her school bag close by\n\u2014 7 \u2014\n\n"
