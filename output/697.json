    "content": "\u2022REVIEWS;\nCINEMA\nDune\nThe Dune Universe comes at\nyou like some madman's dream of a technologically\nadvanced Victorian age\u2014\ngothic stone, brass and steel.\nThese, combined with the\nsheer scale of the sets, all\nserve to diminish the impact of\nthe players on the stage and\ncreate the same depressing\nimage as put over by Blade\nRunner\u2014the idea that man is\ndwarfed by his own constructs.\nThis concept is neatly\nportrayed in the plot, which\ncentres around the feuding\nbetween evil noble lords\n(carefully orchestrated by a totally non-evil emperor).\nThings are complicated by the\nfact that the son of one of the\nlords is the end point of a90 generation breeding programme carved out by a semi-religious sisterhood. The result is that the natives of the\nplanet Arrakis (also known as\nDune) acclaim him as their\nsaviour and proceed to assist\nhim to the emperor ship of the\nknown universe, incidentally\ndestroying the evil noble\nhouse on the way.\nThe acting is excellent, the\nanimation brilliant and the\nsets superb\u2014yet the film fails.\nIt is but a shallow reflection of\nFrank Herbert's masterpiece.\nToo many subtleties of plot\nhave been left out and too\nmuch is left unexplained for\nthose who have not read the\nbook. However, the pith and\ncore of the book's plot are still\ncarried over, if in a somewhat\ngarbled form.\nIf you read, and enjoyed the\nbook Dune then go and see\nthe film\u2014you will enjoy it\nimmensely.\nIf you have not read Dune\nthen don't bother to go\u2014it will\nbe as incomprehensible as the\nnews in Welsh and a lot more\nexpensive.\nSINGLES m&k a srp\"1 Julia and Company: I'm So\nHappy\nRemarkably summery new\nsoul single from the band that\nbrought us Breakln' Down.\nOrchestral backing and brushed drums all give this a really Carri bean feel. Pleasant\u2014very pleasant nothing special, but I can't really fault it. Incidentally, the\nrap remix of Breakln' Down on\nthe B is well worth spinning.\nJermaine and Michael\nJackson: Tell Me I'm not\nDreaming\nTrying to boost the success\nof brother no 6, Michael has\nwrapped his golden vocals\naround this extremely mediocre track from the\nalbum Dynamite. The single is\nvery catchy and stands a good\nchance of top ten success. I wish Michael would get on\nwith his own music though\u2014\nI'm dying for another Thriller.\nThis isn't in the same in the\nsame league.\nThe Bluebells: All I am is\nLoving You\nI do like the Bluebells sound\nvery very much. Melodious\nwithout being bland, harmonious without being\noverpowering, and with\nmarvellously simple lyrics.\nPeople will probably criticise\nthis because it doesn't try to\nbreak new musical ground,\nnor does it try to tell the\nlistener something politically\nrelevant, but at least it's enjoyable to listen to. That is,\nafter all, what matters.\nLotus Eaters: It Hurts\nAfter Last Picture of You it\nappeared as if Lotus Eaters\nwould at long last become\ncommercially successful, but\nit has taken another three\nmonths for a quality follow-up. This will be a big single.\nRather like Icicle Works or\neven Colour Field, this is\nsimple but has enough realism to make even John\nPeel play it. Basically, a classy\nrecord.\nDazz Band: Heartbeat\nFrom the album Jukebox\n(which also contains their last\nhit Let It All Blow) this is a much slower, almost ballad,\nrelease than I would have\nexpected. Typically Motown,\nwith a very American feel, it's much like 50% of the Top 40 at\nthe moment. Certainly, it's no\nworse, but why is everyone\nbuying yankee soul when\nwe' ve got such great musicians of our own?\nIMPERIAL COLLEGE ENTERTAINMENTS\nPRESENTS\n\u00ab THE CENTENARY CARNIVAL \u00bb\n7m \u2014\n7-3\no PM8-J5 PM3-30 PM9-15 P M9-50 pr t jO-l bPM1050 PM11- 15 PM11-15 PM2AM\n- D \u00b0sco\n- JbZz Bind \u2014\n-foe u/ aTf \u2014\n- Comedians:\n- Senior Common Room\nThe /?un ge Concert tb 1\n1\n/\nan Macpherson Mark Steele Steel B3hc|V 'SCO\n- Rent P^y Steel Band\nwith l* ir>b \u00b0 dancer King Gsbby-Tohn Cooper CUkeDfscoThe M ge Union Dining Hall\nThe L \u00b0un geC \u00b0n cer+ hb ll Films: \"This is ip'nd l Tip\n-Unhn Dining fell\n- \u2014 The L<w ge The Lounge\nConcert i bl t11113IO'~|( T..,,.1\" Mid ni6h+ Fxf\u00abSS Con cent Hall\nBsrbequ^ from lp rt outside-Cocktafls in+ he U.D.

    "content": "CLETTERS\nThanks\nDear Sir,\nI would like to express my thanks to the\nmembers of Council who came down to\nattend the meeting at Silwood on 18/2/85.\nWe at Silwood have been trying to inter grate ourselves more fully with South Kensington\nover the past two years so as you will imagine\nwe were very pleased to host this Council\nMeeting. I hope the recent positive trend\ntowards Silwood will continue and that\npeople will no longer look at us as being stuck\non the other side of the country (it is after all\nonly 25 miles from S Kensington to Silwood).\nYour faithfully,\nA J Hamilton\nChairman ICUSP\nWild Goose Chase\nDear Sir,\nI would like to respond to the letter written by\nPeter Chase which appeared in FELIX 696.\nThe Wellsoc poster to which Peter referred\ndid include original material produced by the\nGuildsheet Editor\u2014the captions were not\nthose that appeared in Private Eye, and the\nrelevant Guildsheet front cover headline,\ndirectly referred to myself. The Wellsoc\nposter advertising the lecture on Laser\nWeapons was based on the front cover of\nGuildsheet issue 6 (21 January 1985).\nBoth my letter and the 'invoice' sent by\nMark Cottle were sent as a joke \u2014to make the\npoint that we had noticed the poster\u2014I am\nuncertain of why Peter is trying to make the\nmatter a big media event by writing to\nFELIX. He indicates that he is giving the\n'ridiculous suggestion' that Wellsoc uses\nGuilds' ideas for their publicity 'no attention'\nother than a letter to the most widely-read\nmedium in the College.\nDoes Peter think that by claiming that I have a 'pathetic trumped-up ego' he is\nachieving his revenge for my resounding\nvictory over him at last year's election for\nGuilds AAO. Peter, or whoever in Wellsoc\ndesigns their posters, did not have the\ndecency to mention to Mark or myself that\nthey wished to borrow Mark's idea. Peter is\nnow trying to use smear tactics and half-truths (and displaying his inability to react\nappropriately to a joke) which I am sure will\ndo more damage to the esteem in which\nWellsoc is held than to my interests.\nYours\nLuke Walker\nC& GU Academic Affairs Officer\nGeneral amnesty\nDear Sir,\nA meeting on Monday 18 February with\nthe title 'South African Prisoners of\nConscience' was advertised on notices in\nCollege under the heading 'ICAA and\nAmnesty International'. In fact the College\nAmnesty group played no part in the meeting\nor its organisation and, although Amnesty\nInternational intervened in the cases of more\nthan 200 South African detainees last year,\nNelson Mandela, who was mentioned in the\nnotices, is not one of Amnesty's 'prisoners of\nconscience'.\nYours faithfully,\nCharles Penman\nSecretary AI Group\nDear Sir,\nIn answer to Charles Penman two criticisms.\nThe nature and date.of the meeting had\nbeen fixed and confirmed with Amnesty, by\nthe third week of term (or so I thought). I do\nnot feel that having joint meetings between\ntwo groups infers that they have the same\nviews or aims. I agree that it is very important\nfor Amnesty International to remain totally\nnon-political.\nYes I should apologise about the fact that\nthe posters may have inferred that Nelson\nMandela is an AI adopted prisoner of\nconscience. However, the imprisonment of\nsuch political prisoners as Nelson Mandela,\nand the denial of human rights to opposers of\nthe regime in South Africa, are relevant\ntopics for discussion between groups such as\nAnti-Apartheid and Amnesty International.\nYours,\nJ Michaelis\nA A Chairman\n'Unfair' to RSM\nDear Sir,\nIn reply to last weeks article 'Camborne go\non rampage', I wish to document some\nfurther observations.\nTo put all the blame for the visitors'\nbehaviour on RSM is most unfair. The\nsecurity personnel on this campus are\nemployed to prevent vandalism, theft and\nbreak-ins and on Saturday 9 February they\nseem to have been very slack in this role.\nOn Monday 11 February I spoke to James\nChalmers requesting a report of all the\ncomplaints to be drawn up and for Mr Reeves\nto consult RSMU when this was completed.\nNothing was forthcoming until we read in\nFELIX that a bill was being sent to RSM. I have still heard nothing from Mr Reeves.\nMr Reeves comment that this is the\nbehaviour we expect from miners has\noffended many people proud to be in the\nRSM and in future he should be more wary of\nmaking such degrading accusations.\nYours faithfully,\n^Mike Osborne\nPresident RSMU\nPublicity\nfor\nsabbatical\nelections\nAll candidates in the sabbatical elections\nintending to produce publicity in the Union\nPrint Unit (FELIX Office) should note the\nfollowing deadlines and conditions.\nIn order for publicity to be ready for\npapers down on Friday 1 March, artwork\nmust be prepared over this weekend\n(tomorrow and Sunday), and for this purpose\nthe Office will be open from 9.30am on both\ndays. FELIX staff will be on hand to give\ntechnical advice to any candidate.\nCandidates with any special requirements are\nadvised to contact us without delay.\nAny photographs to be included on\nhandouts should be prints, prefer r ably black\nand white. Lettering on posters can be\nproduced using rub-down lettering (size can\nbe altered using Office equipment) or can be\ntypeset in the FELIX Office. Candidates\nrequiring typesetting, particularly large\namounts of text, must notify us as soon as\npossible, and by Saturday at the latest, for\npublicity to be ready for papers down.\nColoured papers available for posters are\norange, yellow, blue, green, buff, and red.\nCandidates who want other colours should\nlet us know immediately. Handouts can only\nbe done on white paper, or you won't be able\nto afford very many!\nArtwork submitted during the course of\nnext week will not be ready until during the\nweek beginning Monday 4 March.\nSpecially reduced prices have been\narranged for ICU election candidates. For\ninstance 500 posters on coloured paper in two\ndesigns, and 3000 A4 handouts in two designs\nwill cost \u00a345. Less ambitious publicity will, of\ncourse, be cheaper.\nManifestos\nThe deadline for sabbatical election\nmanifestos to appear in FELIX on Friday 8\nMarch is 1.00pm on Monday 4 March.

    "content": "BOAT\nHenley\nwin\nThe club had a successful start to\nthe spring term's events with\nthree wins and other good\nplacings over the weekend. At\nHenley Fours Head, the Novice\nCoxed IV won their division\nconvincingly beating all the\nSenior CMB crew in the process.\nAs well as this extremely good\nresult the women's senior C Coxed IV had an encouraging\nrace coming third in the senior B division. The Women's Novice\nIV racing for the first time gained\nexperience which will stand them\nin good stead and help them\ncontinue the rapid progress they\nare making. At Watney Sculls\nHead, Bill Bradury and Greg\nHarding won the Senior B and\nNovice categories respectively.\nThe College team of four scull ers came second overall to Thames\nTradesman. Hopefully Burway\nHead will be as successful l and\nthe Novice IV will maintain the\nsort of performance which gave\nBill Mason, their coach, ample\nopportunity to comment on how\nthe crew with three months\nrowing experience had beaten\nthe best crews of many of the\nother clubs competing. You tell\n'em Bill!\nTABLE TENNIS\nMagic\nbat work\nSaturday 16 February saw the\nCentral London League closed\nchampionship come and go. This\nyear Imperial entered the largest\nnumber of players for donkey's years (seven) and hopes were\nhigh for at least one notable\nsuccess.\nThe men's singles presented\nproblems for everybody, that is\nnobody made it through the first\nround. The men's doubles saw a slight improvement with one of\nour pairs actually making it to the\nsecond round before being\nknocked out. This left the\nminor's singles (Divsion four and\nbelow not under 12's), our last\nhope for salvaging the pride of\nImperial Table Tennis, only two\nof our players entered as they\nwere the only ones eli gable and\nboth cruised through the first\nround. After the second round\nwe had only one survivor left in\nany of the competitions. After\nbeating a division one player in\nhis group in the men's singles\nAndrew Lewry was confident\nabout doing well in the minors.\nAll went well until the quarter\nfinals when a delay between the\nsecond and third game (caused\nby Andy getting stuck half in, half\nout his track suit jeans) unsettled\nthe flow of play resulting in our\nfinal player being eliminated form\nthe competition.\nMeanwhile in the League the\nfirst team lost 5-4 again. The\nsecond team won a tough fought\nmatch 5-4 (thanks to David\nGallagher for some magic bat\nwork). The third, fourth and fifth\nteams played but no results were\navailable at time of submission,\nhowever from the league table of\nDivision 6 it looks like it will be an\ninteresting fight between the\nfourth and fifth team for the\nfourth from last position at the\nend of the season.\nLinstead\ntops\nThe inter hall Table Tennis\nTournament began in earnest last\nSaturday.\nWith well over half of the 70\nscheduled matches completed,\nLinstead are at the top of the table.\nThey have managed to win eleven\nof their sixteen matches so far.\nWeeks and Garden are not far\nbehind, with nine victories out of\ntheir sixteen matches (each) iast\nweekend.\nEven though Selkirk has only\nmanaged to win six matches so\nfar, L Axelsson's record of four\nwins out of his four allocated\nmatches is a consolation for\nthem\u2014no other player has been\nable to achieve su cria stunning\nperformance.\nFalmouth Keogh should be\ngrateful to their player, D Henty\n(seed No 4) who, with his three\nsuperb wins, has helped to keep\nhis hall in the race for the\nchampionship.\n16 and 17 of February will be the\nclimax of the tournament, with the\ntop three seeds of each hall\nfighting to keep their respective\nhalls in a respectable position.\nTable so fan-Linstead 33 points\nGarden 27 points\nWeeks 27 points\nSelkirk 18 points\nFalmouth Keogh 12 points\nOCTOPUSH\nUnderwater\nwhat?\nIC Octopush team is one of the\nfew College clubs short of\nmembers due to students refusing\nto believe it exists. However, this\nweek, the little known underwater\nathletes scored an exciting victory\nover Donesbury Sub Aqua Club.\nThe team arrived at Donesbury\nsports centre at 8.30 and are\nhurriedly made our way to the\nunisex changing rooms, only to be\ntold that the match couldn't start\nuntil 9.30 since the pool was\noccupied by the women's swimming team. Already hindered\nby one player being absent due to\ntummy trouble we patiently\nwaited for the pool to clear.\nUnderwater hockey, or\n'Octopush' as it is more properly\ncalled, is a game which normally\ninvolves holding one's breath,\ndiving to the bottom of a swimming pool, and knocking a lump of lead around for 39 minutes\nwhilst opposing players start to\nkick you over the head with large\nblack flippers. However,\nMonday's match had the\ninteresting variation that a new,\nexperimental, extra light squid\nwas being used made of\naluminium. When struck with the\n'pusher' (underwater hockey\nstick) it leapt about six inches off\nthe ground and landed in the same\nplace again.\nThings io oke d set for a meaningless 0-0 draw until a clever\nIC defender discover d that if you\nhit the 'squid' (the aluminium\nlump) very, very hard it actually\nwent backwards. Aided by this\nknowledge, he made a strategic\nwithdrawal towards our own nets\nwhich was followed by a blinding\nmass of bubbles and the referee\nsoon declaring a goal having been\nscored at the Donesbury end of\nthe pool.\nSo frustrated by this were our\nopponents that several of them\nabandoned the match and made\nan early return to the unisex\nchanging rooms, hoping to catch\nthe women's swimming team. The\nweakened opposition was then\nunable to prevent a second goal\nbeing scored which to the acute\nem baras s ment of the luckless IC\nforwards was also put in by our\ngoal y. The final result was 2-0 with\nthe aluminium squid being\nunanimously declared a waste of\ntime.\nSPORT: BADMINTON\nUnlucky\nthirteen\nMixed II vs UC (away)\nThis was most certainly a case of\nthe 13 being unlucky\u2014as far as\nUC were concerned. In the very\nfirst game of the match, one of\ntheir players dislocated his knee!\n(And IC were wining).\nIC kindly agreed to a replay, to\ntake place in a week's time. Better\nluck next time.?\nTeam: Chris Bean, Stuart\nCowperthwaite, Farida Katelli and\nAnne Redley.\nMixed I vs UC (Home)\nWhilst in the other UC match it\nwas UC who were the unlucky\nones, this match was the complete\nopposite: IC lost the match by a mere five points!\nThe reason for this is as follows:\nBoth IC and UC fielded only two\npairs (instead of three), which\nmeant that the match was the best\nof four games. Both os IC's pairs\nlost to UC's first pair, whilst\nbeating their second pair, leaving\nthe match even at two games\neach. This meant that the winner\nhad to be decided by adding up\npoints gained by each\nteam\u2014these being:- IC 89\nUC94\nNever fear, IC will hopefully win\nthe return match on Wednesday\n20 March!\nTeam: Andy McAleer, Susan\nYeates, Ava Martivossian, Julie\nGoodeve.\nIC Ladies vs Kings (Home)\nDespite a slight panic at the start\nof the match when only five\nplayers had turned up, this was\nanother successful game for IC\nLadies, as well as the fact that we\nfielded a full ladies team!\nThe game of the match, IC first\npair against Kings first pair was a tense nail-biting affair, but IC\nfinished with a narrow triumph\nover Kings. Then, our third pair\nplaced both their games in\nsuccession, to give IC another two\ngames. What with our first pair\nwining their second game and our\nsecond pair then winning both\ntheir games, this meant that IC\nhad won six games, had three\nc once ede d( as Kings only had two\npairs), giving us a fine 9-0 win.\nTeam: Helen Gregory and Janet\nFolkes (first pair), Susan YEates\nand Anne Pedley (second pair),\nand Farida Katelli and Anne Lister\n(third pair).\nFELIX Friday 22 February 1985 11\n\n"

The\nsummons from behind the ornate ley panelled oak door was a long time in coming,\nbut at last he was invited in.\n'Your reverence', he said, bowing to the\nappropriate level.\n'Do be seated my son', replied the Canon.\nWhen they were both seated, 'I have been\nreading your researches with great interest,\nand am most grieved to hear that the\nArchbishops inquisition has ordered a halt in\nproceedings'.\nThis could be a good sign, thought the\nvisitor, not too direct, as is the way of the\nChurch, but doubtless reports will be sent\nback to the Holy See in Winchester as to how\nwell this interview proceeded 'Yes your\nreverence, I was most distressed to hear that\nmy work might be of a dangerous nature'.\n'Indeed. But rest assured that a resolution\nwill be found. I understand that this device of\nyours could help in farming?'.\n'Yes, your reverence. The driving engines\ncould be used to plough or maybe, with the\nright additions, it could even achieve more\ncomplicated tasks'. Was the canon really\ninterested in what it could do? That would\nmean the Church would almost certainly\nendorse his invention. But they might just be\ntrying to catch me in heresy, though.\n'Come here my son, over to the window'.\nHe moved round the desk and peered\nthrough the leaded glass window. The view\nwas of green forest and, closer, of broad\nfields filled with golden corn. The peasants\nwere already harvesting the corn and piling it\ninto sheaves. 'Our harvest will be great this\nyear, more than enough for all the people'.\n'Yes your reverence, but what if we have a late spring or poor summer. With the use of\nmachines like mine a harvest would be good\neven then'. The conversation had turned\nbad, they are trying to catch me. But maybe\nnot. Perhaps he just wants to hear more of\nthe possibilities.\n'But does not our lord protect us from\nsuch adversity? He provides for the lilies in\nthe field, are we not more deserving?'.\n'There are other uses your reverence.\nTransport is one. And mining\u2014we could\npump mines out using engines and so stop\nthem flooding'. I am falling into heresy, I know it.\n'And what do we find in the mines my son?\nMore iron and crud to build more machines\nfrom? Have you not read the holy edict of\n1712? Mr George Stephenson your work has\nbecome heretical! Do you know who I am? I am special representative for the Inquisition\nin Winchester. You shall be taken there and\nwe shall find just how far your heresy has\ngone'. He ran the bell on his desk. The door\nopened, and four members of the Holy\nGuard entered.

    "content": "LTFEATURE\nThe aim of the newly formed Keep Fit Club is\nto provide inexpensive exercise classes for\nmembers of College. The classes are\ndesigned to be of benefit to both physically fit\nand unfit, women and men.\nExercise should be taken regularly. There\nis little point in the occasional burst of activity\nwhen you get the urge to go for your termly\nswim. This will only leave you exhausted, stiff\nand confused as to why you can only swim\nfour lengths when while at school you could\ndo 25! Frequent exercise should enable you\nto develop increased stamina, strength and\nsuppleness.\nThe work out is performed to music and is\nenormous fun. You don't need to be\nembarrassed if you look more like Cyril\nSmith than Richard Gere, or Clare Rayner\nrather than Felicity Kendal, since the\nchances are that the sylph-like creatures\nnext to you will have just as much trouble\ntouching their toes as you will yours! Only a few weeks of our classes and you will be\namazed at how much easier you find even\nthe stomach exercises!\nBut you are meant to enjoy the Imperial\nWorkout. If you feel any extreme pain or\nmuscle spasms while exercising, or if you do\nnot enjoy it, then stop! If you have recently\nsuffered an injury or have a recurrent\nproblem such as back ache you should seek\nmedical advice before undertaking vigorous\nexercise.\nClasses are on Tuesday and Thursday\nevenings at 6.00 and from Thursday 7 March\nweekly lunch-time lessons will start at\n12.45pm. Each class will last for one hour and\ncost 50p, with club membership at \u00a31.00. All\nthe classes are held in Southside gym\n(op posit ie Southside Shop).\nYou should never exercise on a full\nstomach, don't eat for at least two hours\nbefore a lesson\u2014it is also extremely\nuncomfortable to attempt exercise with food\nand drink sloshing around inside you. You will not need any special clothing, just wear\nsomething comfortable, for example,\ntrack suit, shorts and T shirt, or leotard\n(females only please!). Training shoes or\np lim so ll s are essential for the running\nexercises. Bring a towel or an exercise mat\nfor the floor exercises.\nGet fit\nand keep fit\nwith the\nImperial\nWorkout\nClasses in Southside\nGym\nTuesday 6.00 to 7.00pm Thursday 6.00 to 7.00pm Thursday 12.45 to 1.45pm( starting March 7)\nCost: 50p per lesson\nMembership \u00a3 1\n6 Friday 22 February 1985 FELIX\n\n"

    "content": "Take a Walk \u00a9 o wi? Once again FELIX takes a walk down Exhibition Road, looking into\nplaces of interest that Joe Student/Joanne Student passes with half-closed eyelids at 9.29 each morning. This week: a brush with religion,\nand the opportunity to trace your ancestors.\nNEWS FEATURED\nEXHIBITION\nROAD SW7\nCITY OF WESTMINSTER\nIf there is one building on\nExhibition Road that stands\nout architecturally then it\nmust be the Hyde Park\nChapel of The Church of\nJesus Christ of Latter Day\nSaints. Perhaps its strangeness puts people off as well as\nthe connotation with strange\nsects and religions. This is\ndespite the fact that a notice\nboard outside proudly\nproclaims that the Visitors\nCentre and Geneological\nLibrary attached to the\nchurch are open to all.\nThe Church was founded in\nthe 19th century by Joseph\nSmith in America after a vision. The church gets its\nnickname, the Mormon\nChurch, from the Book of\nMormon that Joseph Smith is\nclaimed to have found on gold\nplates buried near what is now\nNew York. Mormons are\nkeen to point out that they\nbelieve in the Bible, but\nbecause the Book of Mormon\nhas not been altered through\nthe ages to suit more word ly aims it has clarity in places\nthat the Bible has not.\nMormons do not drink tea,\ncoffee e, or alcohol, and\nclaim n that scientific studies\nshow that they have a significantly lower incidence\nof heart disease and cancer.\nThere are Mormon Churches\nin over 90 countries, and they\nclaim it is the fastest growing\nreligion in the UK. Part of this\nsuccess may be attributed to\nthe 30,000 active missionaries\nthe Church has word l wide. There is an exhibition in the\nVisitors Centre where anyone\ninterested may learn a little\nmore about the Mormon\nChurch. Many people fear\nentering a church out of\ninterest because they think\nthat they may be the target of\na high pressure re li go us sales\ncampaign. Indeed, perhaps\nmore so with Mormons than\nany church because their\nhouse-to-house calls have\ngiven them a reputation of\nbeing over zealous and\nenthusiastic. However, the\nVisitors Centre, with its\npaintings, displays and\nmodels seems to have none of\nthe aggressive paraphernalia\nthat would intimidate a casual\nvisitor.\nThe Mormons have a system of proxy baptism for\ntheir ancestors. Mormons can\nbe baptised in place of their\nancestors, to allow them to\nachieve salvation. Obviously\nto achieve this you have to\nknow who these ancestors\nare, and to this end the\nGeneological Library holds\ndetails of over 40,000,000\npeople taken from parish\nrecords on microfilm, indexed\nby name and county. These\nrecords date back into the\n1600s, although for privacy\nreasons there are no details of\nanyone born less than 110\nyears ago. These records are\nopen to the public, and allow\nanyone interested in their\nlineage to make extensive\nenquiries with ease.\nThe baptisms take place in\najac uz zi like bath, and the\nbaptism itself is performed by\ntotal immersion. The\nbaptismal area, like\neverything else in the\nbuilding, is without religious\nornamentation : no crosses,\nno icons, no paintings - just\nwood panne l ling and\nflour e scent lights.\nReligion tends to be a subject that people decide on\nand then stick with that\ndecision for the next 70 years.\nMost have a rough idea what\nthe Church of England or the\nRoman Catholic Church are\nall about, but few students at\nIC know anything about the\nChurch of Jesus Christ of\nLatter Day Saints. It may be\npossible to pass through the\nVisitors Centre without being\nconverted, but not without\nbeing educated.\nThe Hyde Park\nChapel of the Church\nof Jesus Christ of\nlatter day saints\nThe Mormon's Hyde Park Chapel on Exhibition Road. Inside are\nthe Visitors' Centre and the Genealogical Library.\nFELIX Friday 22 February 1985\n\n"

And what\nwas the reason for such\nuncharacteristic enthusiasm on\nthe part of council members? It\nseems that every last vote had\nbeen rounded up to support a move to give money back to the\nConstituent College Unions that\nhad been taken away by a previous meeting.

    "content": "IN THIS ALIEN ENVIRONMENT, SPACE TECHNOLOGY IS OUT OF ITS DEPTH Inspecting underground gas pipelines tor faults may not sound like the\nultimate high-tech challenge. But, in\nfact, the task proved to be beyond the\n'state-of-the-art' technologies previously\navailable - even in military and aerospace applications.\nPROBLEM:\nDesign a vehicle which can travel\ninside the pipe, carrying equipment\ncapable of identifying any significant\ndefect, and pinpointing its position to\nwithin a metre in a run of up to a hundred\nkilometres or more.\nSOLUTION:\nTHE INTELLIGENT PIG\nThe Intelligent Pig, developed by\nthe gas people, is a vehicle carrying\nhighly advanced sensing,data processing and recording equipment. Driven\nthrough the pipe by the gas pressure\nwithin it, the Pig can be used without\ntaking the pipe out of service.\nWhat is more, it can not only pinpoint any defect on the inside or outside\nof a steel pipe.but even describe its nature.\nHOW?\nUsing strong magnetic fields or\nelastic waves propagated at ultrasonic\nfrequencies, different types of sensors\ncan detect corrosion, cracks, impact\ndamage or distortion of the pipe. But\nthe real challenge lay in processing the\nhundreds of millions of signals produced\nby the sensors ir: an average run.\nTHERE WASN'TA COMPUTER\nSMALL ENOUGH AND TOUGH\nENOUGH\nMany of the pipes to be inspected\nare less than 305mm in diameter.To fit\nsufficiently powerful data processing\nequipment into the tiny space available,\nhybrid micro circuits incorporating\ncustom-designed silicon chips had to be\ndeveloped. And since the space restrictions also limit battery size and therefore\npower, many of these highly advanced\nelectronic components have to operate\nat the very limits of their specifications.\nWhat's more.the environment inside\nthe pipe isn't exactly friendly. All the\nhighly sophisticated equipment carried\nby the Pig has had to be designed to\ntolerate or be protected from extreme\nvibration, mechanical shock, dirt, and\ngas pressure of up to 70 atmospheres.\nA 'TOMORROW'S WORLD'TAPE\nRECORDER\nThe sheer volume of data to be stored\ninspired the development of what is\nprobably the most advanced ultra-mini at uri sed tape recorder currently in\nexistence. Making extensive use of sub-miniature hybrid microelectronics, new\ntypes of recording heads and ultra-precision mechanical engineering, this\nlittle marvel can store up to 500 million\nreadings on a single reel of standard\none-inch tape,with an accuracy of better\nthan one-thousandth of one percent!\nFROM REEL TO REELS\nOnce the Pig has finished its run, the\nnext job is to prepare the data for ana lysis by powerful, advanced computers\nsuch as the VAX 1 l/780. There's so much\ninformation in the Pig's tiny recorder\nthat many reels of computer tape are\nneeded to receive it,and many hours of\ncomputer time to analyse it.\nTHE RESULT\nBritain's underground gas transmission network is a multi-billion pound\nasset. And the technical pyrotechnics\nwe've just described have a thoroughly\ndown-to-earth end result-they help the\ngas people to maintain this asset more\nefficiently and cost effectively.\nWHY THE GAS PEOPLE LIVE IN\nTHE FUTURE\nThe fact that gas is Britain's most\npopular domestic fuel-and a powerful\nand growing force in industry, too-is the\nresult of many years' foresight, planning\nand massive investment by British Gas\nscientists and engineers. And they're still\nworking for the future\u2014to meet Britain's energy needs in the next century.\nTHE GAS PEOPLEWORKING FORTOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY\n\n"

'Most students\nignored the bells as an evacuation signal', he added.\nCollege Security Officer Mr\nGeoffrey Reeves condemned the\nresponse to the bells as 'not\nsatisfactory'.\nThe alarm was sounded after\nan anonymous caller to the\nCollege switchboard shouted\n'There's a bomb in the building',\nand rang off.\nThe College-wide bomb alert\nsignal (bells ringing for one\nsecond and off for four seconds)\nwas sounded.

The motion was in\nresponse to the Union Finance\nCommittee (UFC) policy of\nJanuary 17 1985, which reduced\nthe support from ICU for the\nCCU's five year plan expend i ture, and decided that the CCU's end of year balance should be\ntaken into account when\nestimates are fixed.\nThis UFC policy effectively\nprevented any end of year carry-over of funds for the CCUs.\nThe discussion of the motion\nat Council provoked much\nheated debate, mainly between\nthe CCU representatives and the\nPresident and Deputy President,\nIan Bull and David Parry. The\nCCUs pointed out that they are\nan integral but autonomous part\nof ICU and should be treated\ndifferently to the major sub-comit tees. Mr Bull replied that\nthey were integral only when they\nwanted funds and autonomous\nonly when they didn't want to be\naccountable.\nThe motion was passed with a large majority.\nThe next motion, proposed by\nHugh Southey, Publications\nBoard Chairman, asked Council\nto allow major sub-committees\nto carry-over funds, as well.

    "content": "PROFILE;\nAs the City and Guilds College Centenary draws\nnearer, FELIX continues its series of profiles on\nthe CCU presidents with Maribel Anderson,\nPresident of Guilds.\nWhen Maribel Anderson stood for Guilds\nPresident last year she was almost totally\nunknown. As the campaign developed and\nshe emerged as an unstoppable enthusiast it\nwas increasingly obvious to observers that\nonly she could win. There were last minute\n, doubts however.\n'The day of the elections I was in the JCR\nbar. I'd given up drinking and smoking at the\ntime but my hands were shaking and I just sat\nwith a Gin and tonic and a fag. I was going to\ntell Slug (Steve Bishop, President 82-83 and\nMaribel's proposer) that I wasn't going to\nstand because I didn't have a hope in hell's chance'.\nEven Maribel, though, could sense the\npositive atmosphere in the election UGM.\n'I walked in and it was Civ Eng 1, Civ Eng 2,\nladies rugby, Guilds rugby\u2014all my mates. I could have said \"Dibble dabble doo\" and\nthey'd all have cheered. Some people might\nhave been pissed off by that but the fact that I managed to get so many friends and\nsupporters in there who had previously had\nno connection with the Union was a good\nstart. It gave me the impression that I could\n.carry that out throughout the year\u2014which\nhasn't really been the case'.\nDuring the campaign Maribel was very\nmuch an outsider trying to break into a very\nclosed shop. 'I got a lot of hassle from the\nhacks of the union office. I remember I'd walk\nin there and there'd be deadly silence; like\nthe b addy had just walked into the saloon\nand I could hear various whispering s behind\nmy back'. It was just this sort of atmosphere\nthat Maribel set out to alter but readily\nadmits that even her friends are unwilling to\nenter the office, 'They can't stand it. People\nconstantly say to me 'Who are those people\nwho inhabit the office?' Slowly but surely\nthey come in, but only people who have any\n' reason to be there come in, though I seriously think its a lot better than last year'.\nEven after the election Maribel had to fight\nto be accepted and she has bitter memories\nof the start of her Presidency. 'It took me a while to learn the ropes and nobody was\n' giving me any encouragement, I got nothing,\nI got stabbed in the back everytime I did\nsomething wrong. I didn't like anybody in the\noffice, nobody was particularly friendly and I just hated it'. These problems also con cide d with a sub born ly persistent illness which\ndrained her of energy and the hacks of\npatience. Talking to Maribel this term it is\nobvious the bad times are over and she is\ndetermined to enjoy the job. 'I'm looking\nforward to the rest of the year now that I'm on form and I get along better with\neverybody. The problem is that the first term\nis where you breed the enthusiasm, people\nhave already formed their ideas and they\nwon't give you a second chance. I might be\nready to hit hard this term and the centenary\nmight give me a slight chance but that's already botched up in a sense and its going to\nbe very difficult to get that support again'.\nThe year so far has not been one of\ncomplete doom and gloom with the tug-o war and the RCS Smoking Concert being the\nhighlights for Maribel. 'I love it when people\nactually turn out to do things. It gives me\nsuch a sense of achievement, pride and\ngrand things like that. When people turn up\nthey tend to have a really good time and it\nbugs me when they're just too apathetic or\nthey're too preconceived in their ideas to\neven bother turning up'.\nSurrounding the activities of the Guilds\nPresident is an air of theatre which Maribel\nrecognises and which certainly suits her\neffervescent personality. 'I do like being the\ncentre of attention at times, I suppose it is\negotistical. I like being in the middle of it,\nshouting and cheering. I love standing up and\ngiving speeches at UGMs, but only when the\natmosphere is there. To stand up at a UGM\nlike the last one when there are 30 people\nthere just makes me wonder why the hell I bother.\n'The role of a Guilds UGM is far removed\nfrom that of the formal JCU version. Our\nUGMs are very much just a show. You could\nput it in the same vein as Hi di Hi and we're\nthe maroon and silver striped coats. I think\nquite a few people come along hoping to hear\nsomething of relevance and get very\ndisillusioned with the whole thing because\nthere isn't really much to say'.\nMany union posts involve much unseen\nwork with C CU President being particularly\ndifficult. Maribel obviously takes pride in this\nside of the job. 'I am in three places at once\nsome days. I wouldn't say it was a real strain,\nsometimes it's very pleasing when you get it\nall done, nobody knows what you've done\nbut you feel so proud that you've fitted so\nmuch into a day'.\nAs for the future Maribel has no great\nplans. She predicts a third class degree in\nCivil Engineering but obviously thinks it\nunimportant and says with a sigh 'I am not an\nacademic'. At one interview she recalled how\nshe'd explained what President involved, and\nanswered all the questions about being a women in a man's world. Feeling confident of\nleaving a good impression she left the room\nto find Ann Collins outside. As she said,\n'They must think we have a whole string of\nfemale presidents'.\nWhatever happens, she seems sure to find\nsomewhere to channel her enthusiasm\u2014and\nGod help the opposition when she does.\nFELIX Friday 22 February 1985\n\n"
