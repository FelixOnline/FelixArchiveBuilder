    "content": "Felix 1000th Edition\nChanging Careers Of Graduates\nDirector of\nthe Careers\nService, John\nSimpson,\nwrites about\nhow the\ndestinations\nof Imperial\nCollege\ngraduates\nhas changed.\nWhen Felix was in its early\nyears, fewer than 5% of 18 year\nolds went to University; this\nfigure is now approaching 30%.\nOther significant changes over\nthe last 40 years include the\nincrease in the number of\nfemale, overseas and mature\nstudents, the increase in the\nnumber of graduates undertaking postgraduate and\nresearch courses and an increase\nin the number of students from\nethnic minorities.\nThe destinations of graduates\nhas also changed with the move\ntowards commerce and away\nfrom industry. There has also\nbeen a decline in both opportunities and interest in teaching\nand the public service.\nUnemployment has fluctuated\nover the last 40 years, reaching\npeaks in the early years of each\ndecade.\nThe Decline of Employment in\nIndustry\nIn the 50s and 60s, graduates in\nengineering and science began\nin careers related to their degree\nsubjects. All this started to\nchange in the early 70s. With\nindustry suffering from the\nrecession, accountants realised\nthat there were graduates\nlooking for alternative careers.\nThe recession in the early 80s accelerated the move to\ncommerce with the result that,\nsince 1972, the percentage of\ngraduates entering commerce\nhas increased from 17% to 32%.\nIn the same period, those entering industry fell from 32% to\n23%. Public service also\nsuffered a decline but education\nremained reasonably stable. The\nbox below illustrates the trends\nat the start of each decade for\nthe last thirty years.\nUnemployment\nHome first degree graduates\nbelieved unemployed at 31st December:\n07\u201e\n1976-77\n10\n5.9\n1981-82 13.5\n1986-87 6.2\n1991-92 11.6\nA feature of the 50s and 60s was\nvery low graduate un employ ment, with figures of less than\n5%. We consider unemployment\nto be bad in the early 90s, but a glance at the figures above\nshows the extent that unemployment has fluctuated since the\nmid 70s. One interesting fact is that\nwomen have consistently\nexperienced lower rates of\nunemployment than men.\nTeacher Training\nIn the mid 70s teacher training\nwas still popular, but the actual\nnumbers choosing this option\nfell steadily from 5,946 in 1977\nto 2,355 at the height of the\nyuppie boom in 1989. They\nhave only crept up to 3,789 in\n1992. One can understand the\nconcern of the Government as\nthey try to persuade more scientists to take up teaching. One\nincentive they are operating is\nthe award of bursa ries in\nsubjects with a shortage of\nstudents.\nFurther Academic Study\nThose following further academic study in the UK totalled\n6,229 in 1977 and remained\nstable until 1990 when the total\nreached 7,223. By1992 the\nnumbers had increased sharply\nto 10,287.\nThis is partly a reflection of\nthe difficult job market, but it is\nalso a recognition that a postgraduate qualification can be a help in starting some careers.\nUnemployment rates for postgraduates have been lower than\nthe rates for graduates.\nEmployer Categories of Male and Female First Degree\nGraduates Entering Home Employment\n{Old Universities)\n1971-72 1981-82 1991-92\nTotal Entering\nHome Employment 20,798 29,008 28,796\nPublic Service 6,845 (33%) 7,839 (27%) 7,527 (26%)\nEducation 1,665 (8%) 1,538 (5%) 2,034 (7%)\nIndustry 6,637 (32%) 8,676 (30%) 6,487 (23%)\nCommerce 3\n,\n4\n9\n4 (17%) 8,538 (29%) 9,300 (32%)\n\u2014 24 \u2014\n\n"

Getting lost and confused\nin the number of clubs and societies at Imperial College is\nquite easy and if you try to\nunderstand the structure it gets\nworse! Clubs, committees,\nsub-committees, we've tried to\nunravel them, look at their origins and how they've evolved\nsince their formation.\nImperial College Union was\nborn in the autumn term of\n1911 with Sir Arthur Acland as\nits father. The idea was to provide the students from the three\nconstituent colleges (City &\nGuilds, Royal College Of\nScience and Royal School Of\nMines) with a club based along\nthe lines of the unions at\nOxford and Cambridge\nUniversities.\nThe main objectives of the\nclubs of Imperial College Union\nwere to unite more closely the\nstudents from the constituent\ncolleges and to help secure a reputation for Imperial College\nparallel to the standard of the\nacademic one.\nThe ten years following the\ncreation of the Union saw the\nappearance of approximately a dozen clubs which still remain\ntoday. These include traditional\nsporting clubs such as the\nAssociation Football Club,\nLawn Tennis Club and the Boat\nClub which started just after the\nFirst World War. Other sporting\nclubs that existed in the twenties are the Golf Association,\nSwimming Club, Badminton\nClub and the Rugby Football\nClub.\nSport was not the only interest at the time, as shown by the\nexistence of the Chess Club,\nChristian Union and the Wine\nTasting Society, which is\nnotable for having met in the\nsame place (the Union Dining\nHall) for over 70 years.\nSome clubs no longer exist\nin their original form but have\nwas the springboard for the\nrock band Queen, Brian May\nhaving studied at Imperial\nCollege.\nThe next major step was the\nreforming of the existing clubs\ninto two committees, the\nAthletics Clubs Committee and\nthe Social Clubs Committee.\nOne of the reason for this\nchange was to enable the\nAthletics Club Committee to\naward colours while the Social\nsplit and given rise to various\ndaughter clubs. This is the case\nof the Literary & Debating\nSociety which has split into the\nArts Appreciation Society and\nthe Debating Society. The\nMusical & Dramatic Society\nhas given rise to a number of\nclubs. Amongst these are the\nDramatic Society, Choir,\nSymphony Orchestra and the\nJazz and Rock Club. The latter\nClubs Committee could not.\n(Colours are awards for services beyond the call of duty to\na particular body of people\nwithin the Union.) This reason\nwas soon forgotten as all committees now award colours.\nAs the number of clubs within the Union increased, the\nRecreational Clubs Committee\nseparated from the Social Clubs\nCommittee.\n\u2014 10 \u2014\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 1000th Edition\nBelow: Aerial shot of Imperial\nCollege in the 1950s before the\nmassive expansion programme.\nBelow opposite: Imperial\nCollege in 1970 when most of\nthe construction had\nbeen completed.\n(Photos provided courtesy of\nHunting Aerofilms.)\ntower, Queen's Tower, was 87\nmetres tall, had a copper dome\nand held a peal of ten bells\ndonated by a Mrs Millar from\nMelbourne. At the time it was\nbuilt, it was one of the tallest\nbuildings in London.\nThe Imperial Institute opened\non 10th May 1893 but gradually\nlost significance as an icon of\nthe British Empire in the 20th Century. However, its proposed\ndemolition as part of Imperial\nCollege's expansion programme\n(1957-65) provoked opposition\nfrom the general public.\nA letter to The Times in\nFebruary 1956 began: \"It is no\ncrime, in itself, to replace an old\nbuilding by a new one. It\nbecomes a crime only when a good old building is replaced by\na bad new one.\"\nIt went on to explain the\ndilemma: \"If the Imperial\nCollege is to play, in London,\nthe role chosen for it as a great\nscientific and technological\ncentre, the area now occupied\nby the Imperial Institute and its\nadjacent buildings will be\nrequired.\" As a compromise, the\nQueen's Tower (then known as\nCollcutt's Tower) was left\nstanding, requiring substantial\nreinforcements to keep it erect.\nThe Imperial Institute, meanwhile,\nbecame the Commonwealth\nInstitute and moved to Holland\nPark in 1962.\nThe Expansion Programme\nIt was the aforementioned\nexpansion program which has\nmoulded the College into what\nwe see today. Imperial College\nwas accepting more and more\nstudents and was hungry for\nextra space. Comment in issue\n87 of Felix stated that if the\nopponents to the expansion\nscheme \"went behind this\nfacade that faces the Royal\nCollege Of Science they would\nrealise that the fire hazard in the\ndraught y wooden corridors and\nthe galvani sed tin roof makes a mockery of the wedding cake\nfrontage.\"\nFew original buildings now\nremain in their entirety: the City\n& Guilds College was demolished, the Chemistry Department\nwas rebuilt and nearly all departments other than the Royal\nSchool Of Mines were given new\npremises. The Huxley Building\non Exhibition Road was abandoned and a 'new' Huxley\nBuilding was erected in 1975 on\nQueen's Gate. The old building\nis now the Henry Cole Wing of\nthe Victoria & Albert Museum.\nReferring to the changes to\nBeit Quad, issue 79 of Felix\nreported that \"Beit Quadrangle\nwill be laid out as a semi-formal\ngarden with grass lawns and\nYork stone paths and some central feature which may be a fountain. The tennis club have\nreceived extra courts at Harlington as compensation for the loss\nof its old courts on this site.\"\nThe picture of today's Imperial College is completed\nby the addition of St Mary's Hospital Medical School. St\nMary's Hospital was founded at\nPaddington and enrolled its first\ntwo students in 1851. The\nMedical School, founded in 1854,\nbecame part of the University\nOf London in 1900. In 1988 it\nmerged with Imperial College\nadding another discipline to the\nCollege's name which became\nImperial College Of Science,\nTechnology And Medicine.\nThe Imperial Institute1\nis clearly visible in the centre of the photograph. Across Imperial Institute Road (now Imperial College Road) are\nthe Chemistry and Physics Departments2\nof the Royal College of Science. Perhaps the only recognisable College buildings are those in Beit\nQuad3\n. The Union Building4\n, however, has yet to receive its two uppermost floors. The former Huxley Building5\nis just visible opposite the\nScience Museum and the City & Guilds College6\nstills stands on Exhibition Road.\n\n"

    "content": "Felix 1000th Edition\nAn artist's impression of the Imperial College Union Building in the 1930s. Throughout the years more\nclubs started, reflecting the\nbroadening interests of the\nstudents. These included the\nGliding Club (1930), Sailing\nClub (1949), Billiards Club,\nFilm Society, Jewish Society\n(1951) and the Underwater Club\n(1957).\nThe seventies saw a boost in\nthe formation of clubs. This\ngave rise to the formation of the\nSocial & Cultural Amusement\nBoard in 1973 which grouped\ntogether all the 'performing'\nclubs. Soon to follow was the\nPublications Board in 1976 due\nto the increasing interest in\nmedia clubs. After Felix, which\nbegan in 1949, S.T.O.I.C( the\nStudent Television Of Imperial\nCollege) started in 1969. I.C. Radio was formed at about the\nsame time, but they only got a licence to broadcast on medium\nwave in December 1978.\nThe last committee to emerge\nwas the Overseas Students\nCommittee, at the beginning of\nthe eighties. This reflected the\ngrowth and importance that\nOverseas societies were beginning to have within the Union.\nIn the past 15 years Imperial\nCollege has seen a considerable\nnumber of changes among the\nstyle of its clubs. The 'traditional\nclubs' still exist, but the main\nchanges have occurred in the\nrecreational and social clubs.\nThe Tiddlywinks Society\ndisappeared at the end of the\nseventies. The practice of this\n'sport' is now restricted to the\nlength of Oxford Street on the\nsecond Saturday of the autumn\nterm - one of Rag's most popular events.\nThe Croquet Club, which\nused to play on Queen's Lawn,\nonly existed during the seventies.\n1975 saw the beginning of the\nPimlico Connection Society. It\nis within Imperial College that\nthe scheme itself was formed\nand it has now spread to many\nother universities around the\ncountry. 1976 saw the beginning\nof completely different type of\nclub: the Wargame Society.\nIn the eighties, the advance in\ntechnology led to the emergence\nof the Micro-computer and\nScience Fiction Societies.\nSocial changes also led to\nnew societies like the PATA (or\nPro-life) Society, United\nNations Society, Third World\nFirst Society, C ND Society\n(which stopped in the early\nnineties) and the Vegetarian\nSociety (VegSoc). It is\nrumoured that VegSoc ceased to\nmeet after a group of people\nbecame members and held a barbecue on behalf of the society\nin Beit Quad!\nNew sports societies include\nthe Parachute Club, the Fitness\nClub and the Wing Chun Club.\nOn the other hand, the eighties\nsaw the end of some of the old\nsocieties like the Astronomical\nSociety, Railway Club and the\nTranscendental Meditation\nSociety (which reformed at the\nstart of this year). The Graffiti\nClub and HG Wells Society\nlasted slightly longer but both\ndied out in the late eighties.\nNew born clubs included\nSplot Soc (a paint balling society), the Computer Graphic\nSociety and the Science &\nEthics Society.\nAt the beginning of this\nacademic year there were 122\nUnion clubs and societies listed\nin the Imperial College Union\nHandbook. Bearing in mind that\nthere are also numerous clubs\nwithin each of the four\nConstituent College Unions, it\nlooks as though Imperial\nCollege students are not as\napathetic as some people claim.\nThe Constituent College\nUnion societies tend to have a more academic nature. Some of\nthese were originally Imperial\nCollege Union societies which\nreformed under a Constituent\nCollege Union. This is the case\nwith the Astronomical Society\nwhich is now a Royal College\nOf Science society.\nCurrently Imperial College\nUnion spends more money per\nstudent on its clubs and societies\nthan any other University's Union in Britain. What the\nfuture holds for all the societies\nwithin Imperial College Union\nis dependant on the funding that\ncan be allocated as well as the\nmotivation, interests and enthusiasm its students.\n\u2014 11 \u2014\n\n"

This is not\nsurprising when statistics show\nthat nationally only 37 women\ngraduated with an engineering\ndegree in 1962 compared with\n2,539 men. The numbers of\nwomen at Imperial College have\nincreased significantly since\nthen to the present total of 26%.\nLondon has always attracted\nlarge numbers of overseas\nstudents and Imperial College\nhas certainly benefited from\nthis, especially in respect of\npostgraduates. Similarly, large\nnumbers of ethnic minority\nstudents wish to study in\nLondon and many choose to\ncome to Imperial College.\nImperial College has not\nattracted large numbers of\nmature students. The reasons for\nthis are debatable, but probably\nreflect the high entry standards\ndemanded for all the courses.\nEmployers from industry\nhave targeted Imperial College\nfor many years for the high\nquality of our technical graduates. Accountants and other City\nemployers soon recognised that\nImperial College graduates had\nthe skills needed in the financial\nservices industry. As a result,\nabout 20% of Imperial College\nfirst degree graduates entering\nUK employment went into this\nline of work.\nThe high reputation of our\nresearch has encouraged above\naverage numbers of Imperial\nCollege graduates to stay on to\ndo research.\n1993 Destinations\nWe know the destinations of\nover 90% of Imperial College\nhome first degree graduates who\ngraduated in 1993. At 31st December, under 11% were\nunemployed, 38% went on to do\nhigher degrees and 33% gained\npermanent employment in the\nUK. The major destinations of\nthose gaining permanent\nemployment included 9% in the\npublic service, 51% in industry\nand 34% in commerce.\nImperial College home higher\ndegree graduates recorded only expect their staff to keep up to\n3% unemployed, 19% went on date.

You cannot expect to\njoin an employer and have a secure career for the rest of your\nworking life. You must equip\nyourself with the skills to\nchange and to develop throughout your career, both technically\nand personally.\nContinuing professional\ndevelopment is recognised by\nthe professions as crucial to\ntheir members. Employers\nchosen fields without much help\nfrom the then embryonic\nImperial College Careers\nService.\nNowadays, students use the\nCareers Service to assist them\nwith their choice of careers and\ntheir search for jobs both before\nand after they graduate.\nIf you find yourself between\njobs in a few years time you are\nwelcome to make use of the\nCareers Service at any time.

Winds of over 100\nmiles an hour on 25th January\n1990 caused an estimated\n\u00a310,000 worth of damage to\nCollege buildings.\nTizard Hall was hit by\ntragedy on 9th June when a student died after falling from\nthe top floor of the building.\nOver the summer, the\nClayponds site in South Ealing\nwas purchased by College to\nprovide accommodation for 405\nstudents. The development was\nexpected to cost around \u00a311\nmillion, to be partially funded by\nthe sale of Montpelier Hall.\nThe Government was rocked\nin November by the resignation\nof Prime Minister Margaret\nThatcher on 22nd November,\nafter controversy within the\nConservative party over her\nleadership. She was succeeded\nby the Chancellor John Major\non 28th November.\nAlso this year, the elected\nFelix Editor & Print Unit\nManager Chris Stapleton was\nunable to take up his sabbatical\npost after failing his exams (he\nlater re-took the year). He was\nappointed to the temporary\nUnion staff post of Print Unit\nProduction Manager. Andy\nButcher was elected as a non-sabbatical Felix Editor in the\nballot in early December. A student referendum held at the\nsame time rejected the idea of\nextending the College Day to\n9am6 pm. The idea was\nproposed by a College Working\nParty chaired by Professor Alan\nSwanson. It was later accepted\nas College policy.\nA new centre for Population\nBiology at Silwood Park was\nopened by Margaret Thatcher\non 9th January 1991. Later in\nthe month, the Rector\nannounced plans for a new\nscience park in South Wales.\nThe project, located in Newport,\nwas developed jointly by\nImperial College, the Welsh\nDevelopment Agency and\nNewport Borough Council. The\nfirst phase involved the building\nof a \u00a32 million technology\ncentre, 'Imperial House'.\nAfter the start of Operation\n1990-Imperial College students protest against the Gulf War\n'Desert Storm' in Kuwait on\n16th January, an Iraqi student at\nIC was given 28 days notice by\nthe Home Office to leave the\ncountry (20th February).\nImperial College stated their full\nsupport for the student's appeal.\nThe Government scrapped\nthe Poll Tax on 8th March after\nnational campaigns against it.\nBritain's first astronaut, Helen\nSharman, joined Russian astronauts in the MIR space station\non 19th May.\nOn 18th October, a student\nwas seriously injured during an\nattempt to stop a mascot from\nbeing stolen during a mascot ry raid. He underwent two operations on his leg after being run\nover by a van that was driving\naway with the mascot.\nIssue 924 of Felix was stolen\nby members of the cast of the\njoint DramSoc and OpSoc\nproduction 'Grease' (31st January 1992). 3,500 copies\nwere removed from departments\nsoon after they had been de liv ered. The culprits felt that a review of the production in that\nissue could have damaged ticket\nsales. Union President Zoe\nHellinger admitted she was\npartly responsible.\nA rally in London protesting\nat student debt organised by the\nNational Union of Students\n(NUS) on 12th February\nattracted 25,000 students.\nThere were rumours in June\nof a serious split in the College\nmanagement over the possibility\nof buying Furse House, the\nformer Ministry of Defence\nHostel on Queen's Gate\nTerrace. The College would\nhave needed \u00a33 million to buy\nthe building, which would be\nused for student ac com moda tion. Felix reported the\nexistence of a discussion\ndocument on demolishing\nSouthside halls to make way for\na conference centre (issue 938).\nPlans for Imperial College to\nbecome a 'medical super-school' were revealed in\nOctober. On 11th December,\ntwo female students were\nassaulted and attacked by five\nmen outside the Huxley building on Queensgate.\nFelix was the first to reveal\nleaked details of the Higher 1990 -Education Students' Charter in Jar, 25 -issue 958 (19th February 1993), Aprincluding proposals to strip Jun9Local Education Authorities of Aug 8 -grant and fee paying powers.

However, following a report on scientific instruction\nby a Select Committee to the\nHouse of Commons, a Royal\nCommission was set up in 1870\nto investigate the education and\nadvancement of science. This\nCommission recommended that\nthe Royal School Of Mines be\nmoved to South Kensington,\nwhere it would be consolidated\nwith the Royal College Of\nChemistry.\nOn the new site, laboratories\nwere provided for practical\ninstruction in physics and biology\n(hitherto entirely lacking); a Chair of Mathematics was\nestablished and the School was\nto be made available for the\ninstruction of science teachers.\nThe South Kensington site\nwas chosen because the\nGovernment had acquired\ntwelve acres of land there, from\nthe Commissioners of the 1851\nExhibition, for use by the\nScience and Art Department. At\nthe time, the site was a wasteland of sheds and temporary\nbuildings except for one building of curious design on\nExhibition Road. It was said to\nhave been erected for the Royal\nSchool Of Naval Architecture,\nbut the School chose alternative\npremises at Greenwich in 1873.\nIn any case, the building (known\nthen as the Huxley Building)\nwas quickly occupied by departments of the Royal College of\nScience.\nBy moving into larger\npremises, it was possible for the\ndepartments to expand. This had\nnot been possible at Jermyn\nStreet and Hanover Square.\nCity & Guilds College\nIn 1878, the City & Guilds Of\nLondon Institute For The\nAdvancement Of Technical\nEducation was created. In the\nfollowing year, classes in chemistry and physics were instituted\nat temporary quarters in Cowper\nStreet School, Finsbury. From\nthis grew the Finsbury\nTechnical College which\nopened in 1883. The Institute's chief aim was realised when it\nfounded the Central Technical\nCollege Of The London Institute\non Exhibition Road in 1884.\nThe College's function gradually\nnarrowed to the teaching of\nengineering and in 1873 its title\nwas changed to the City &\nGuilds College.\nImperial College\nSo, by the turn of the century\nthere existed on the South\nKensington site, three separate\ncolleges covering between them\nthe whole field of pure and\napplied science. Inevitably,\nthrough overlapping subjects,\nthe three institutions worked\nclosely together and on 8th July\n1907, Imperial College Of\nScience and Technology was\nestablished by Royal Charter.\nCity & Guilds College took a little longer to be incorporated\ninto Imperial College, but by\n1910 all three were linked and,\nas a whole, were established as\na School of the University Of\nLondon.\nThe Imperial Institute\nTo commemorate Queen\nVictoria's Jubilee, the Prince of\nWales (later King Edward VII)\nhad proposed the Imperial\nInstitute in the summer of 1886.\nThe Imperial Institute (stretch-ing the length of what is now\nJ,'::};'111'' ff lP lft \u00a7!>l\\ Imperial College Road) was\nintended as a museum and\nexhibition centre dealing with\nIndian and other colonial affairs,\nencouraging emigration and\nexpanding trade.\nSince it was true to Prince\nAlbert's aspirations for the\nSouth Kensington site, the\nInstitute was advocated by\nQueen Victoria.

And Other Stories\nBeit\nThe relationship between\nthe Beit family and\nImperial College goes\nback to the early years\nof the century when\nAlfred Beit of Wernher,\nBeit & Company gave\nthe College a total of\n\u00a3244,000 from the firm and his private\nfortune. Beit had become extremely wealthy\nthrough the South African diamond trade and\nhad already given money for academic\npurposes in Johannesburg and Hamburg. After\nAlfred's death in 1906, his brother, Otto\n(pictured above), succeeded the estate and\ncontinued to support Imperial College. He was\nknighted in 1924 and a memorial plaque was\nunveiled in Beit Arch after his death in 1930.\nBlackett\nPatrick Blackett began\nhis academic career\nstudying physics at\nCambridge with Lord\nRutherford. During the\nwar he worked with\nTizard applying Operational Research to such\naspects of war as anti-submarine activity and\nstrategic bombing. Controversially he argued\nthat the atomic bombs had been dropped for\npolitical not military reasons and he was\nviewed as a voice of conscience within the\nscientific community. He became a Professor\nof Physics at Imperial College in 1953 and\nPro-Rector from 1961-64, receiving a life\npeerage in 1969.\nHuxley\nThomas Henry Huxley\nwas one of the big\nfigures in Victorian\nscience. After five\nyears spent as a Naval\nsurgeon, he returned\nto England and was\nelected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In\n1881, he became the first Dean of what was\nthen called the Normal School of Science\nand the Royal School of Mines. Best known\nfor his robust defence of Darwinian\nEvolution, he gained the nickname,\n'Darwin's Bulldog' and played a major role\nin the popular acceptance of the theory.\nRoderic Hill Air Chief Marshal Sir\nRoderic Hill first came to\nprominence during the\nFirst World War as a flying officer. In the period between the\nwars, he flew experimental flights into such subjects as wing\n'flutter' and radio controlled aircraft. He became Rector in 1948\nuntil his death in 1954. During that time, he sought to broaden the\nCollege's focus, introducing lunchtime General Studies and a weekly Touchstone discussion session.\nHaldane Richard Haldane was the prime\nmover behind the Charter of\nIncorporation of the Imperial College\nof Science and Technology of 1907. Always interested in e duca tion, it was mainly because of Haldane's encouragement that\nImperial College became a part of the University of London.\nHaldane studied philosophy and wrote a book on the implications of relativity. As a liberal M.P., he served as Secretary of\nWar and Lord Chancellor, before being forced out of public life\nin 1915 because of his close ties with Germany .\nLyon Playfair Lyon Playfair started\nlife as a chemist\nemployed at the\nMuseum of Economic Geology, which was a forebear of the\nRoyal School of Mines. He was a member of many Royal\nCommissions studying such subjects as the Buckingham\nPalace drains, the Irish potato blight and the 18481\n49 Cholera\noutbreak. Playfair became an influential figure in the promotion of widespread scientific education.\n\u2014 12 \u2014\nFelix 1000th Edition\nDan noir William Penney has been called the 'father of the British Bomb'. A student and an assistant\nML C ll J.J. Cy professor at Imperial Colleg before the Second World War, he was one of the few British scientists who were sent to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project. He saw the atomic bomb\ndropped on Nagasaki and it was the power displayed there which led him to understand that Britain needed a deter-rent, too. However, the release of recent papers has somewhat dented Penney's reputation as it appears that he fabricated the first tests of the British hydrogen bomb in order to prove the project was progressing.\nAs the Chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority, he also headed the inquiry into the 1957 Windscale radiation leak. On becoming Rector in 1967, there was some concern\nexpressed within the College about his suitability for the role as an\ninternal appointment was thought to be better. Yet Penney had the\nlast word. After retiring in 1973 he described the job as being a dead-end: \"There is nowhere to go and at the end of it you are\ndead.\"\nBessemer Henry Bessemer\nwas a one-time\nstudent at the\nCollege of Chemistry which was one of the\nprecursors of the Royal College of Science.\nAfter his death a memorial fund was set up in\n1903 in his honour. This raised \u00a315,000 for\nthe building of a metallurgical college which\nbecame part of the Royal School of Mines.\nImperial Colfeg\nUsfuvessityof Lorata\nSherfield After training\nlawyer, Sir Roger\nMakins joined the\nForeign Office. He was sent to the American\nEmbassy in 1945 and was involved with the transfer\nof atomic secrets between Britain and America. In\n1953 he was sent back to Washington, this time for a three year period as Ambassador.\nHe became the chairman of the UK Atomic Energy\nAuthority between 1959 and 1963 and it was during\nthis period that he was appointed the Chairman of the\nGovernors of Imperial College.\nAfter being made Lord Sherfield in 1963, his competence in the area of science policy was recognised\nby another appointment, this time as Chairman of the\nLords' Select Committee on Science and Technology.\nThe Committee's final report suggested that a cabinet post should be created for Science and\nTechnology, but Margaret Thatcher was not one of\nSherfield's most successful audiences.\nWeeks Lord Weeks was the\nChairman of Vickers Ltd\nfrom 1949-56. As part of\ntheir corporate plan to advance technical edu-cation, Vickers gave Imperial College\n\u00a3150,000 to build a hall of residence which\nwas opened in 1959.\nLinstead Patrick Linstead\nwas a chemistry\nstudent at Imperial\nCollege who became a member of staff, gaining an international reputation in organic\nchemistry. After various academic appoint-ment s, he worked at the Ministry of Supply\nduring the war, returning as Head of Chemistry\nin 1949 and becoming Rector in 1955.\nOne of his most troublesome moments was\ncaused by his support for the proposed demolition of the Imperial Institute. This resulted in a huge public outcry\nwhich eventually saved Queen's Tower. He also oversaw the redevelopment of the halls of residence in Princes Gardens. The establishment of both the Haldane and Lyon Playfair libraries and the expansion of the Harrington Sports Ground displayed his concern for the\nwider issues of university life.\nTizard Henry Thomas Tizard\nwas described as \"pro b ably the best scientist in\ngovernment service\" during the 1940s and certainly he was highly influential in the scientific progression of both wars.\nHe flew in the Royal Flying Corps testing\naircraft and bomb sights during the First\nWorld War. Afterwards, he worked on aero\nengine fuels before becoming College Rector in 1929. In the same\nyear he was also made Secretary of the Department of Scientific\nand Industrial Research.\nIn his additional capacity as Chairman of the Committee for the\nScientific Survey of Air Defence, he encouraged the development\nof radar. During the war he worked with Blackett in Operational\nResearch and was involved with the development of the 'bouncing\nbomb', Whittle's jet engine and the transfer of technical information from America. He stepped down as Rector in 1959 to become\nPresident of Magdalen College, Oxford.\n~\u00a57~\u00a3\u00b1g^ gx\\\\ Sir Alfred Keogh was the second Rector of\nJVeOilfl Imperial College, from 1910 to 1922. An organiser and administrator of the first rank,\nKeogh was an army medic. As Director General of Army Medical\nServices, he totally overhauled military medical organisation and\ntraining prior to the First World War.

This was also the\nyear when Derek Bentley was\nhanged, despite 200 MPs pleading for a reprieve.\nJuly saw the death of the\ninfamous '29 Club', a group of\npractical jokers responsible for\nputting coloured paper all over\nthe lamps in front of the Prince\n(removal of someone's trousers)\nper person per hour took place\nin the previous week than ever\nbefore.

The litho, which is used\nto print Felix every week, broke down at\naround midday yesterday.\nFelix 1000 was due to be produced in\ntwo parts: a normal Felix (containing\nnews, reviews, letters and articles) and a special 1000th Edition Supplement. By the\ntime the litho broke down, the supplement\nhad been printed, but only a third of the\nnormal Felix had been completed.\nThe printer, Andy Thompson, attempted\nto repair the litho in order for the printing\nto continue but, despite his extensive\nprinting experience, he was forced to call\nthe maintenance engineer.\nThe engineer was unable to assess the\nsituation until early this morning and Mr\nThompson was unsure, at the time of\nwriting, if the litho was immediately\nrepairable. Even if it could be repaired\nwithin a couple of hours, this would still\nbe too late for Felix 1000 to be completed\nin time to be distributed with the\nSupplement.

Today it forms the\nnorth side of Beit Quad.\nWith the prospect of Albertopolis\nlooming large over South\nKensington, attention has been\nfocused on the area'sarchi tec ture. You do not have to have\nboth eyes open to notice that\nmost of Imperial College sticks\nout like a sore thumb. But has it\nalways been such an eyesore?\nImperial College was officially established by Royal\nCharter in 1907 but its complex\nhistory can be traced back\nanother half century. Complex\nin that its birth was preceded by\nno fewer than ten name-changes\nand almost as many changes of\npremises.\nThe present site in South\nKensington is owned by the\nRoyal Commission For The\nGreat Exhibition Of 1851. It\nwas purchased as part of Prince\nAlbert's plan for the development of South Kensington as a centre for education in art and\nscience.\nThe Prince was also chiefly\nresponsible for the three national\nmuseums (the Science Museum,\nNatural History Museum and\nVictoria & Albert Museum)\nbeing situated in such close\nvicinity. Most of the College's departments, however, originated\nelsewhere and gradually accumulated at the South Kensington\nsite between 1872 and 1891.\nThe Origin Of The\nRoyal School Of Mines\nImperial College has always\nbeen a union of constituent col-leg es. The oldest, the Royal\nSchool Of Mines, can be traced\nback to the Museum Of\nEconomic Geology which\nopened in 1841 in a house in\nCraig's Court SW1, adjoining\nthe old Scotland Yard. From the\noutset, it enrolled a limited\nnumber of pupils but its teaching function expanded when it\nmoved to Jermyn Street in 1851.\nThere it offered courses in\nmining and applied sciences. At\nthis new location, it was reopened\nas the Museum Of Practical\nGeology. Its founder, Henry De\nLa Beche, went on to establish\nthe Government School Of\nMines And Of Science Applied\nTo The Arts later in that year.\nThis new school was staffed by\na group of eminent scientists\nand held courses relating to all\ntheoretical and practical areas of\nmining and geology.\nThe Origin Of The\nRoyal College Of Science\nThe Chemistry Department of\nthe Royal College Of Science\ntraces its descent from another\nfoundation. The College Of\nChemistry was founded in\nOctober 1845 and from\nDecember of that year, with\nQueen Victoria's consent, it\nbecame known as the Royal\nCollege Of Chemistry. It sought\nnew premises at 16 Hanover\nSquare which had an impressive\nfrontage on Oxford Street.\nA Marriage Of Sorts\nIn 1853, the Royal College Of\nChemistry became part of the\nGovernment School Of Mines\nAnd Of Science Applied To The\nArts in a bid to solve its financial problems. As a result,\nstudents on the mining school\ncourse found themselves sharing\nthe laboratories at Hanover\nSquare with chemistry students.\nIt was hoped that the School\nwould broaden its educational\nscope and in the same year yet\nanother name change was in sti gated.

    "content": "Felix 1000th Edition\nCollege life, particularly to\nmethods of studying. Sir Ronald\npredicts that \"within five years\nif we could afford it, or maybe a little bit longer, I'd expect the\nwhole College to be on a fibre-optic net, with outlets in all\nCollege premises and in student\nresidence rooms. People could\nsimply take their\nlaptop, plug in,\nget the week's problems, do\nthem, then transmit them back.\nMaybe examinations will be\ndone that way.\"\nLectures and\nconventional libraries will still\nhave their place,\nhowever.\nAlien Science\nFor Sir Ronald,\nencouraging interdisciplinary\nresearch efforts\nat the College is\nthe most important thing he\ncould achieve\nwhile Rector:\n\"For the future\nvigour of the College, we are\ngoing to have to move into\ninterdisciplinary areas. We've\ndone that effectively in some\nareas but not in others.\"\nHe adds that the divisions\nbetween subjects are as much a matter of historical accident as\nlogic. \"If an alien being arrived\non the earth tomorrow, looked\nat the sum of human scientific\nand technological knowledge\nand was then asked to divide it\ninto convenient chunks for\nteaching and administration, it's not clear that the subjects of\nphysics, chemistry and biology\nwould emerge,\" he explains.\nAs the future role of Imperial\nCollege as a university takes\nshape, the face we show to the\noutside world may soon be\naltered dramatically. A scheme\nto re vital is e South Kensington\nas a centre for science and arts\nin the next millennium was\nannounced earlier this year,\nunder the title of 'Albertopolis'.\nThe proposal is the result of\ntwo years of discussions\nbetween Imperial College and\nother institutions in the area.\nThe challenge was how to\nimprove the South Kensington\nsite to meet the demands of the\nnext century.\nIt quickly became apparent\nthat the aims of individual institutions could benefit from a joint development of the surrounding area. The idea of\nAlbertopolis emerged naturally\nfrom these discussions.\nThe Albertopolis plans include a remodelled Queen's Lawn with\nthe Queen's Tower surrounded by a reflecting pool.\nDesigns on the Future\nSir Norman Foster and Partners\nwere the architects chosen to\nproduce a plan for the area.\nTheir proposed solution would\nprovide better public access and\namenities. It would unify the\ninstitutions physically and allow\nthem to interact more easily\nwith one another.\nThe project name - a working title - is a tribute to Prince\nAlbert, whose original vision\nled to the South Kensington we\nsee today.\nIn the twenty-first century, an\nImperial College student would\narrive at South Kensington\nunderground station to be greeted by the Millennium Mall - an\nunderground street running the\nlength of Exhibition Road. It\nwould provide direct access to\nthe three museums and the other\nAlbertopolis services, including\ninformation centres, ticket\noffices and shops.\nA Facelift for Imperial College\nMost important for Imperial\nCollege are the plans to remodel\nits unattractive f agade. The\nmain change would be improvements to the Queen's Lawn area\nto give the College a social\nfocus. More green areas would\nbe created and car-parking\nwould be relocated from\nImperial College Road.\nMeanwhile, a new building\nwould be built on top of the current mechanical engineering\nbuilding. Professor John Archer,\nPro-Rector of\nImperial College\ndescribes the\nnew building as\n\"a shop window\nfor what we do at\nImperial, providing facilities for\nlectures and\nexhibitions. I would hope that\nit would allow\nthe public to get\na better understanding of the\nscience going on\nat the College.\"\nExhibitions focussing on the\nfuture by the\nRoyal College Of\nArt would also\nbe displayed.\nAccording to\nProfessor Archer,\nthe Albertopolis\nproject means that \"the site\ncould be restored to some of its\nformer splendour as a centre for\nscience and the arts.\"\nAlbertopolis will be ex pen sive, so the future of the project\ndepends on money from the\nMillennium Fund. This is being\nset up from proceeds from the\nNational Lottery. The Fund is\nintended to finance a range of\nprojects to commemorate the\nnext century.\nIan Caldwell, Imperial\nCollege Estates Manager, thinks\nthat the Albertopolis bid has\nunique advantages: \"It's more\nlarge scale than the others...it is,\nin a sense, a regeneration project and has the extra economic\nbenefit of helping science, technology and medicine.\"\nSome have made grand\nclaims for the Albertopolis\nscheme: \"This could become a model for the rest of London,\"\nsays Spencer de Grey, who\nleads the design team.\nSir Ronald Oxburgh is more\ncautious: \"I don't see that great\nor profound an effect, but it\nwould make Imperial a far more\nattractive place to study.\"\nWhat The Students\nThink About\nAlbertopolis\n\"They should change the\nname!\"\n\"Well, they can't make\nMech Eng look any worse.\"\n\"I'm not going to be here,\nso I don't care.\"\n\"It might make South\nKensington more expensive for students.\"\n\"I'd rather they spent the\nmoney on better student\naccommodation.\"\nThe Year Ahead\nAt Imperial College\n\"We're negotiating a big\nexpansion of Union facilities at present, with the\nfirst priority being a sec-on d hand bookshop.\"\nLucy Chothia, next year's Union President\n\"Accommodation at the\nmoment is variable...it\ndoesn't really seem what\ntomorrow's scientists\nshould be living in while\nstudents and that's a high\npriority for me.\"\nDan Look, next year's Deputy President (Finance\n& Services)\n\"My main aim next year is\nto get more sponsorship for\nclubs and societies.\"\nIan Parish, next year's Deputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties)\n\u2014 29 \u2014\n\n"
