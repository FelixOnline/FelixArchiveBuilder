It came four\ndays into industrial action\nby the Universities and\nCollege Union (UCU),\nwhich could last up to 14\ndays.\nA proposal by UUK,\nthe organisational body\nfor UK higher education\ninstitutions, claimed the\ncurrent USS pension\nwas operating with a\ndeficit of \u00a37.5bn, and the\nemployee contributions\nhad increased by more\nthan 50% since 2014.\nThis proposal has been\ncriticised by a number of\nparties, however, including an Imperial working\ngroup, who said a \u201clack\nof transparency remains\na key issue\u201d in the debate.\nCollege has committed\nto \u201cfully resource any\nstaff\u201d who participate\nin the evaluation of the\nproposals. In a statement\nfor Felix, a College representative said: \u201crecognising that this work may\ntake time and go beyond\nthe statutory deadline for\nchanges to be introduced,\nand if asked to do so, the\nCollege has pledged to\ncarry its share of the risk\nof staying on the current\nscheme while this work is\ncompleted.\u201d\nThis week saw the\ncompletion of the first\nfive days of strike action,\nwith a number of Imperial\nstaff and students braving\nthe cold weather to stand\non picket lines.

As students\nof Imperial College, we\nought to be calling on\nour senior management\nto defend their staff and\nlobby UUK to ditch the\nproposed pension changes\nonce and for all.\u201d\nUCU representatives\nwelcomed the news.

Many\nhave joined the union\nspecifically to support\nthe action, and up to a\nhundred of our members\nhave joined picket lines.\u201c\n\u201cOn Tuesday the President announced a huge\nshift in the position of the\nsenior management at Imperial, altering their hardline stance in supporting\nthe implementation of the\nvery detrimental changes\nto staff pensions. It shows\nthat the senior management are at last beginning\nto grasp the level of\noutrage among staff at\nhave averted the strike.\n\u201cIt is up to UUK to get\nto grips with the reality\nof the situation and come\nto a fair and acceptable\nsettlement.

UCU have tabled a\nset of proposals, including\nprovision of a guaranteed\npension for members and\nuniversities accepting a\nsmall amount of increased\nrisk.\nUCU general secretary\nSally Hunt said: \u201cWe are\npleased the employers\nhave agreed to more\ntalks\u2026 We have listened\nnot just to our members,\nbut also to the many university leaders who have\ncontributed ideas.\u201d\nA number of university\nleaders had called on\nUUK to reopen talks with\nUCU, in an effort to limit\nthe likelihood of further\nindustrial action.\nStudents and staff on the march on Wednesday // Ansh Bhatnagar\n\u201cIn an email,\nAlice Gast said\nthe College\n'are now\ncalling on UUK\nto convene an\nexpert group'\u201d\nSpeaking to Professor\nStirling at the picket line\nearlier this week, he told\nFelix the developments\nover talks were \u201cpositive\u201d: \u201cUUK and UCU\nare getting Acas involved\nand getting back around\nthe table.

This year things\nare probably going to\nbe even more intense,\nsince the two weeks of\ncampaigning and voting\nare going to be crammed\ninto one. If there are any\nlectures not being cancelled by the strikes next\nweek, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be\ntaken up by innumerable\nawful shout-outs, so\nlook forward to that.\nAs for me, I\u2019m nearly\nfree! This time next week\nvoting will have closed,\nand we should be about to\nfind out who next year\u2019s\nsabbatical team are. For\nwhoever succeeds me as\nFelix Editor, I wish them\nthe best of luck, and pray\ntheir neurotic tendencies\nare less pronounced than\nmine\u2026 The next week\nis a difficult time for the\ncurrent sabbatical officers;\nwe\u2019re going to spend most\nof the week listening to\nour potential successors\npoint out all the things\nthat haven\u2019t done, and\npromise to do a better job\nthan we have. Ouch. I get\nwhy it has to be done, but\nit ain\u2019t going to feel good.\nBut it is something the\nsabbatical team need to\nhear, myself included.\nMany people run, not out\nof some desire for change,\nor to do good (although\nthose do come into play),\nbut more out of frustration\nat how things have been\ngoing so far. I don\u2019t think\nanybody puts themselves\nforward because they\u2019re\nhappy with the status quo:\nyou nominate yourself\nbecause you have opinions on what hasn\u2019t been\ndelivered, and you have\nideas about how to deliver\nthem \u2013 whether that\u2019s\nimproving the counselling\nservice, bringing back\nSCR breakfasts, or just\ntrying to make Imperial a\nfriendlier place to be.\nFor all those running, I\nask one thing: this week\nmight go by in a blur, but\nnever forget that feeling\nof anger or frustration that\nmade you run in the first\nplace. The Buddha might\nhave said holding onto\nanger is like holding onto\na hot coal, but perhaps in\nthis current weather that\u2019s\nexactly what is required.\nPlus I don\u2019t think the\nBuddha ever had to deal\nwith the Fusion price\nincrease, so I\u2019d take the\nadvice with a pinch of\nsalt.\nThe sabbatical roles\naren\u2019t ones you can\ndo adequately without\nat least a modicum of\npassion for the job; after\nall, many of you could\nprobably be earning quite\na bit more working for a\nlarge faceless corporation,\nso the decision to work for\nnot quite as much, in a not\nquite as large, not quite\nas faceless charity must\nmean it\u2019s something you\ntake an interest in. Hold\non to that passion; don\u2019t\nlet it be extinguished when\nyou get into your role, but\ninstead use it to push for\nchange, and achieve all\nthe things you don\u2019t think\nwe\u2019ve done.\nSo if you\u2019re running\nmake sure you don\u2019t pull\nany punches; shout loud\nand clear about what you\nwant to do, and make sure\nyou go ahead and do it.\nAnd this goes for Felix.\nJust don\u2019t be mean about\nmy editorials.

    "content": "ISSUE 1687\nFELIX\n15\nARTS arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk\nA powerful revival of the mystery of Hanging Rock\nO\nn Valentine\u2019s\nDay, 1900,\nthree pupils and\na teacher from\nAppleyard College, an up-per-class girls\u2019 boarding\nschool, disappear during\na class trip to Hanging\nRock, a volcanic mountain in Victoria, Australia.\nThis is the premise of Joan\nLindsay\u2019s 1967 novel and\nPeter Weir\u2019s subsequent\nfilm adaptation, both subjects of critical acclaim\nand, arguably, cult classic\nstatus. Though fictitious,\nthe story is so compelling\nthat it is widely believed\nto be true, thanks partly\nto Lindsay\u2019s often coy and\nmysterious answers about\nits basis in reality. Not\nhaving seen the film or\nread the novel I came into\nthe theatre with only a\ncursory knowledge of the\nstory, but it was impossible not to set expectations\nhigh when both the source\nmaterial and its adaptation\nhave been so successful.\nThe play starts with five\nschoolgirls on a sparse\nstage, narrating the events\nof Saturday, Valentine\u2019s\nDay, 1900. Despite the\nsetting of the play, they\nare wearing modern\nschool attire: blazers and\npleated skirts that would\nnot look out of place on a\nsecondary school student\nin 2018. In 1900, after\nthe school group have\nlunch, four of the girls,\nMiranda, Marion, Irma,\nand Edith leave the rest\nof the group to climb the\nrock. Miranda is clearly\nthe leader of the group,\nthe one the other look up\nto. Edith is the hanger-on;\nshe struggles to keep pace\nwith the other girls and\nbegins to fall behind. As\nshe watches, the other\ngirls vanish into the\nrock. The five-strong cast\nslowly move forwards as\nthey speak, closer to the\naudience and closer to the\nend of the stage. Their narration is interspersed with\nblackouts. It\u2019s incredibly\nsimple, but, somehow,\nvery captivating. The\nfive actors are phenomenal and with only their\nvoices and playwright\nTom Wright\u2019s words they\nconjure up images of what\nmight have happened. The\nempty stage, their ringing\nvoices and stark lighting\nhelp your own imagination to create images far\nmore sinister than what\ncould have been captured\non stage. The switching\nperspective between the\ngirls and the frequent\nblackout create a story\ntold in cut scenes, reminiscent of horror films.\nThe aftermath of the\ngirls\u2019 disappearance takes\non a more conventional\nstorytelling, with the\nscenes being acted on\nstage. The narrators\nbecome actors in the story.\nThere are searches for the\ngirls and their teacher,\nyet nothing is found. The\nschool community begins\nunravelling and headmis-tress, Miss Appleyard,\nbegins taking out her frustration on Sara, a girl who\ncannot seem to fit into\nwhat society demands of\nan upper-class woman.\nMichael, an Englishman,\nembarksonasolitaryquest\nto find the girls. These\nscenes are interspersed\nwith blackouts and each\nscene is accompanied by\na cryptic neon heading\nabove the stage. Through\nMichael and Miss Appleyard, Wright explores\nthemes of colonialism\nand power, centring on\nAustralia. What Michael\nhas come to learn of the\nwilderness of Australia\nterrifies him. Miss Appleyard\u2019s attempts to mould\nSara to her will mirrors\nthe attempt to tame and\nconquer Australia.

Four\nminutes into the game and\nall the meticulous game\nday preparations seemed\nto be in vain, as Camborne\nSchool of Mines scored\nthe opener. This only\nproved to spur on RSM. A\ngoal line save to prevent\nan equaliser added to the\nfrustration, but it wasn\u2019t\nlong before Henry Sewell\nset up Rich Price for a\nwell worked goal to raise\nRSM spirits both on and\noff the pitch. Celebrations\nwere short lived though,\nas a quick counter attack\nfrom CSM cancelled out\nthe comeback effort and\nbrought the game to 2-1\nwith ten minutes remaining in the first half. A\nfrantic end to the half saw\na stray cross diverted in\noff RSM defender, Steve\nPugh, to gift Camborne a\n3-1 lead at the half time\nwhistle.\nRousing words from\nthe older lads rallied\nthe side, and the Royal\nMiners from London went\ninto the second half with\nnothing left to lose. A\ngoal-line scramble ended\nin disappointment as\nthe RSM comeback was\ndenied once more. This\nlead to yet another swift\ncounter attack with four\nCornish players breaking\nfree \u2013 a goal looked\ncertain to cement CSM\u2019s\nvictory.

Sensing the\ngame was getting away\nfrom them, CSM held the\nball in an attempt to run\nthe clock down. This only\nserved to motivate RSM\nmore as Howard Richards\nnearly broke the backboard with a cannon of a\nshot to level the match at\n3-3 with just five minutes\nleft to play.\nKnowing a draw\nwould be enough to\nretain the Sharpley Cup,\nthe Royal Miners dug in\nand defended with their\nlives to see the game out.\nAs the seconds ticked\npast 70 minutes, the ball\nfound its way back into\nthe RSM circle and a late\ntackle by Captain Rowan\nHedgecock awarded\nCSM\u2019s Callum Fraser a\npenalty stroke with the\nfinal hit of the game. It\nseemed the comeback was\nwasted, but first year goal\nkeeper Lekan Ogunlana\nhad been given a different\nscript.

Unfortunately\nCSM managed to get\nthrough and we conceded\nour first goal. Not to let\nanyone\u2019s spirits get low\nthe older girls yelled out\nencouragements and kept\neveryone\u2019s heads up. Our\nnew goalkeeper Qing\nHua, who had only started\nplaying a few weeks\npreviously, kept her head\nin the game. CSM were\nquick and strong on the\nball, making fast runs\nwhich kept our wingers\nAvni Patel, Yvonne Riley\n,and Ruth Pike on their\ntoes. Not much(ish) could\nget past our defenders\nand our fresher\u2019s Minty\nHampden-Martin and\nElin Mars-Jones worked\nincredibly hard along\nwith Bottle Match oldies\nEvelyn Mason and Beth\nGrant and put pressure\non the CSM attackers,\nchannelling them into\nthe corners where our\nglorious RSM spectators\nvoiced their approval.\nAlice Tidswell dominated her central position,\nsending out some brilliant\nballs, and being downright amazing despite\nbeing fresh out of two\ninjuries and having driven\na minibus 300 miles the\nday before, along with\nEvelyn Mason and Ruth\nPike (our hockey girls\ntruly are the best).

Hertfordshire set the tempo in\nthe first game, catching\nus off guard and pinging\nus out individually until\neventually, Steve was\na lone Wolverine faced\nwith four Herts players.\nWith little time left, Steve\nsingle handedly whittled\ndown the Stags to a single\nplayer. The game ended a\ndraw \u2013 a fortunate result\nconsidering our poor team\neffort.\nAfter a shaky start,\nwe settled as a team and\nconcentrated on shaping\nthe game to our liking.\nWe won the next few\ngames with fantastic\nthrow accuracy from Vino\nfor example from our\nCaptain, Filip Sebest,\nallowed us to run down\nthe clock and minimise\nthe effectiveness of their\ngame victory. We knew\nour strategy was working\nas we entered the break;\nthe score at 8-4.\nAlthough we struggled\nto gain three ball advantage off the start of each\nmatch, sporadic catches\nfrom Leo Haigh and\nLochlann Allison gave us\ninitial number advantages\nwhich then allowed our\nstrong throwers to pick off\nthe Stags one by one. We\nwould\u2019ve been na\u00efve to\nthink Hertfordshire would\ngo down without a fight,\ngaining small advantages\nof their own from getting\nhits off pre-throws and\nwith punishing counters at\nthe half way line.\nIn the end, we remained\nabsolute as a team, and\nworked a well-deserved\nvictory from our closest\nrivals. With two wins\nfrom two against the Stags\nand remaining unbeaten,\nwe have a fantastic chance\nof defending our league\nchampions title.

It is\nestimated that 1-2% of the\npopulation in developed\ncountries will experience\na chronic wound during\ntheir lifetime. In the US\nalone, there are over six\nmillion chronic wound\npatients, and treatment is\ncosting around $25 billion\nper year. However there\nhas been many important\nbreakthroughs recently\nin the field of treating\nchronic wounds.\nFirst, a biotechnology\ncompany in Iceland\nnamed Kerecis Ltd. has\ndeveloped ways to treat\nwounds using materials\nmade from fish skin. The\nentiate, and eventually\nturn into living tissue.\nAnother recent discovery was the importance\nof miRNA in chronic\nwound healing. MicroRNAs or miRNAs are\nshort non-coding RNA\nsequences that can participate in regulating gene\nexpression, through post\ntranscriptional silencing\nof mRNAs. Recently\nmiRNA has been found to\nbeinvolvedinmanydiffer-ent diseases, and chronic\nwounds is no different.\nIndeed, it was found that\nmiRNA levels in normal\nacute and chronic wound\nhealing differs; thus, the\nunder-expression and\nover-expression of certain\nmiRNAs are responsible\nfor disrupting the normal\ncompany\u2019s products have\nalready been approved\nby the FDA, and it can\nbe used to treat acute,\nchronic, and oral wounds.\nThe company\u2019s products\nare made from drying\nand processing cod skin.\nFish skin is naturally rich\nin omega-3 fatty acids,\nwhich yield anti-inflam-matory effects that can\nspeed up the healing\nprocess. The material substitutes the extracellular\nmatrix crucial for healing\nand lacking in chronic\nwound patients.\nTheextracellularmatrix\nis composed of a variety\nof polysaccharides, water,\nand collagen proteins, and\nthe scaffolding provided\nby the matrix recruits cells\nwhich proliferate, differ-stages of wound healing.\nThe miRNAs involved\nin wound healing are\nbeing discovered, and this\nprovides the possibility of\ngene therapy for patients.\nHowever, it is not yet a\nvalid therapy, as there\nneeds to be a suitable\ndelivery system of drugs\nthat can overcome intracellular and extracellular\nbarriers.\nLastly, technology that\ntargets the microenviron-ment around the wound\nhas been proven to accelerate the healing process.\nThis involves using lactic\nacid bacteria as vectors\nto produce and deliver a\nhuman chemokine (sig-nalling proteins) to the site\nof the wound. The specific\nchemokine being upregu-lated is CXCL12, and its\ndegradation is slowed, as\nthe lactic acid produced\nby the bacteria lowers the\npH. The resulting change\nin the microenvironment\nleads to more immune\ncells gathering, and they\nalso become more spe-cialised, producing more\nTGF\u00df, a growth factor\ninvolved in healing.\nOverall, there are\nexciting prospects for the\nfuture of treating chronic\nwounds, although some\ntechnology is still in the\ndevelopmental stage,\nthey are showing great\npromise. Chronic wounds\nstill affects millions of\npatients, and the technologies discussed in this\narticle may provide a cure\nfor them.\nKerecis has been named Iceland\u2019s fastest growing startup // Kerecis\n\n"

In fact, most of\nthe time, it\u2019s not very\ntechnical at all. It\u2019s sort of\na patched-together set of\nreactions to a number of\nmusical lineages, which\nentangled to form the\nangry, thrasy, alive music\nwe know and love today.\nOne thing \u2013 there have\nalways been skinhead\npunk movements, but I\u2019m\nnot going into them here.\nThis isn\u2019t what punk\u2019s\nabout; in the immortal\nwords of the Dead\nKennedys, \u201cNazi punks\nfuck off!\u201d The punk I\nknow and love is fervently\nanti-racist.\nOk, history. The very\nfirst reaction was to 60s\nand 70s rock. Country,\nfolk, and blues diverged in\nthe early 1900s US; blues\ngrew up in the Mississippi\ndelta, and moved north\nto Chicago and Detroit,\nwhere it became electrified and gained wider\naudiences. This was the\nprecursor of modern rock,\nwhich evolved in the 40s\nand 50s. Rock shared with\nblues an affinity for the\nsame three chords (tonic,\nsubdominant, dominant,\nor I-IV-V in various ar-rangements). This sparseness was integral to the\nsound of the era; however,\nas rock aged, it left these\nbehind. Gone were the\ndays of minimalism and\nintimacy; the Guitar God\nwas born, and displays of\ninstrumental technicality\ncame to dominate the live\nrock show.\nThis irritated the first\npunks, who came from\nthe 60s garage-rock scene\nand kept with them a DIY\nethos \u2013 bands like the\nKinks, the Seeds, and the\nSonics. Traditional punk\nbands like the Clash grew\nup in this era \u2013 tubthump-ing mish-mashes of power\nchords and energy.\nIn the US, experimental\npost-psych acts like the\nVelvet Underground and\nthe Stooges were defining\na sound of their own; a\nwave of the sound hit New\nYork City in the early 70s,\nincluding the Dictators,\nthe Modern Lovers, and\nWillie Alexander and the\nBoom Boom Band. These\nguys were avant-garde,\nexperimental, and did not\ngive a shit about the established tastes of the time.\nMeanwhile, CBGB came\nand became a happening\nplace \u2013 Blondie, the Cure,\nthe Talking Heads, and\nso on. And in December\n1969, a name was born:\n\u201cWhiny, adolescently\nrepulsive and barely disThey\u2019re pretty well\nknown [citation needed].\nAlong the lines of pop\npunk, the Ramones paved\nthe way; bands like the\nBuzzcocks and the Undertones emerged, and had\na significant influence on\npop-punk and skate punk,\nwhich arose \u2013 and will be\ntalked about \u2013 later.\nAnd the evolution\ncontinued; new wave\nhappened, with bands like\nUltravox, the Pretenders,\nthe Cars, Tubeway Army,\nand CBGB acts like\nthe Talking Heads and\nBlondie, which began\nmoving in a less abrasive\nand more pop-friendly\ndirection. Descendents\ninclude Morrissey, Duran\nDuran, Interpol, the\nNational, the Strokes,\nthe Killers, Slowdive,\nand Franz Ferdinand all\nhave a new-wavey, post-punky heritage. These\nguys played with poppier\nsounds, synths, and a\nrange of emotion decidedly less than just screaming\ninto the mic.\nOn the other hand,\nthere was a movement to\nmake punk sound cold\nand industrial. Post-punk\nwas a parallel movement,\nfeaturing Joy Division,\nthe Fall, and the Raincoats. Modern derivatives\ninclude Protomartyr and\nNew Order, which formed\nfrom the remains of Joy\nDivision after Ian Curtis\u2019s\nunfortunate suicide.\nThese artists are known\nfor droning, plodding,\nspacy soundscapes and\na brooding worldview.\nMany of these bands hail\nfrom the north of England,\nor other post-industrial\nareas (Protomartyr is from\nDetroit, for example) \u2013 a\nsoundtrack to the desolate\nmetalscape.\nThe second wave of\nska was also brought\nabout by punks; bands\nlike the Specials, the Beat,\nand Madness typified the\n2-tone \u201cmod\u201d era, and\nfed massively into the\nrise of third wave in the\nUS (more later); their\nmusic was marked by\na reggae-inspired sense\nof rhythm and HORNS\nEVERYWHERE. While\nska originated in Jamaica\nalongside rocksteady and\nreggae, it was precisely\nthis deterritorializing\n(to quote Deleuze and\nGuattari) adoption that\nhas sustained the genre.\nThe Specials are also\nthe origin of the cultural\ntouchstone that is Walt\nJabsco, a skanking man\n(\u201cskanking\u201d refers to a\ndance common at these\ngigs; the term survives in\nmodern drum\u2019n\u2019bass).\nFor this installment,\nI\u2019ll close here, because\nthis underpins a point I\u2019d\nlike to make: lots of punk\ndoesn\u2019t sound like what\npeople think punk should\nsound like. Punk is more\nan ethos, an aesthetic, a\nset of positions on religious wars endemic to the\nmusic industry, where au-thenticity, self-expression,\nand music for music\u2019s\nsake take priority over any\nother interest (be it corpo-rate, Nazi, or The Man in\nyour favorite incarnation).\nAnd that\u2019s why punks get\nso mad about \u2018sellouts\u2019:\ndo whatever you want,\njust do it for yourself.\nStay tuned for Part 2:\nhardcore, skate, thrash,\nand the third and fourth\nwaves of ska.\n\u201cWhiny,\nadolescenty,\nrepulsive, and\nvery similar\nstreet-punk\nanthems\u201d\nMUSIC\nHenry Eshbaugh\nMusic Editor\nW\na\nl\nt\nJ\na\nb\ns\nc\no\n/\n/\nr\nj\no\nn\ne\ns\nd\ne\ns\ni\ng\nn\nThe Velvet Underground & Nico, their debut // Verve\ntinguishable street-punk\nanthems\u201d wrote John\nMendehlson of the Stooges\u2019s debut.\nThese two lines, post-psych and garage-rock,\nare the ultimate stylistic\nsource of punk, but punk\nrepresents an ethos that\ntranscends any particular\nsound. Punk is primarily\nabout community and\nindividuality. Authority is\nscorned; individual, DIY\neffort is encouraged, and\nthere is a great importance\nto the notion of \u201cauthenticity\u201d \u2013 music, writing,\nart made with no reservations or ulterior motives,\nart made for art\u2019s sake.\nAnyways, CBGB, the\nsmall Manhattan venue,\nthrived. The Heartbreakers, the Voidoids, and\nthe Dead Boys all came\nthrough those doors, as\ndid hundreds, hundreds,\nof other acts. Over its\n30-something year run\nopen, CBGB became the\nheart of US punk rock at\nthe time.\nIn the UK, a shop\nnamed SEX hired some\npeople, gave them names\nand trendy clothing, and\nformed the Sex Pistols.\n\n"

This week Grumpy Bastard has a lot to say about Huel, and why it will doom\nhumanity\nCOMMENT\nGrumpy Bastard\nComment Writer\nT\nhis week I\u2019ve\nbeen feeling\nC h r i s t m a s s y,\nwhich is to say\nvindictive and hateful.\nIt\u2019s probably due to the\nsnow falling all over\ncampus that everyone is\nendlessly posting pictures\nof on every form of social\nmedia they can access. No\none is going to get snowed\nin or freeze to death,\nwhich is all the worse\nfor the College in light\nof the strikes. The sudden\nsnow flurries at this time\nof year is incontrovertible\nevidence that Alice Gast is\nan evil ice witch, hellbent\non using her powers to\nprevent staff from obtaining a fair pension deal.\nThink Frozen, but with an\ninability to freeze the only\nthing that matters: her\nremuneration package.\nAnyway, moving on,\nthis week I have been\nconfronted with the\nmonstrosity that is Huel,\nas one of my friends has\nstarted brandishing his\nbottle as a replacement for\nlunch. As with all those\nthat have recently adopted\na food fad, they decided\nthat they immediately had\nto convert me to their way\nof life, by simultaneously\nexalting their new unparalleled existence and denigrating my own. Imagine\na pushy vegan, but one\nthat only eats one thing.\nHuel is described on its\nwebsite as \u201cNutritionally\ncomplete food, simply delivered.\u201d This I agree with,\nif you want your nutrition\ndelivered with a side of\nself-hate. Drinking Huel is\nlike choking down a grey\nsoup of misery, because\nit is in essence just workhouse gruel for the 21st\nCentury. This is probably\nwhy I am surprised that\nit has become fashionable\nwith those of middling\nincome as condemning\npeople to consume col-ourless, flavourless liquids\nis normally the preserve\nof the ruling classes, or\nthose enduring futuristic\ndystopias. I still don\u2019t\nunderstand why they offer\ndifferent flavours: as the\nsaying goes, you can\u2019t\npolish a turd.\nHuel as a foodstuff is\nconsumed as a time saving\nmeasure, to increase the\nefficiency of human life\nand reduce the amount of\ntime spent preparing and\neating food. As an ardent\ntraditionalist, the idea\nof making our lives ever\nmore efficient can result in\nonly one inevitable trend.\nThe removal of the work\nlunchtime, or the space in\nthe day that all employers\nhave been obliged to give\ntheir workforce since\nthe beginning of time.\nBy allowing Huel to be\nadopted across the whole\nspectrum of society, we\nface the prospect of being\ngiven the barest amount\nof time to add the powder\nto our Huel branded\nshakers, before adding\nwater, shaking it around\nand chugging it down in\na bare 5 minutes. This\nshould obviously be completed while wearing the\nHuel branded T-shirt that\nthey send out as part of\ntheir insidious advertising\ncampaign.\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is,\nasusual,thatwhoeveruses\nthis product should feel\nunbearable, soul-crushing\nguilt, as they are going to\n\u201cHuel is\ngoing to ruin\nlunchtimes as\nwell as tasting\nterrible\u201d\ntotally ruin lunchtimes, as\nwell as subject the rest of\nus to a flavourless future.\nIn the name of inefficien-cy, I beg you to dispose\nof your Huel branded\nshakers, and send this\nblind futurism where it\nbelongs: back to the smug\nScandinavians.\nNew Year, New News!\nFelix are setting up a weekly newsletter, delivered\nstraight to your inbox.

IC 1s have won\nthe tournament for the last\nthree years. Matches were\nnine minutes long, and\nthere were two groups,\nfrom which four teams\nqualify for the semi-finals,\nfollowed by the final.\n1s take home the\ncrown\nThe IC 1s had a\ncomfortable group, their\nfirst game against IC 3s.\nThe 1s annihilated their\nown clubmates with a\n29-2 victory. Building up\nmomentum, they sliced\nthrough Manchester and\nLSE 2s with relative ease.\nThe final group match\nagainst the UoB 2s went\nwithout incident, until one\nof the defenders (Felix)\ndashed out the raider,\naccidentally hitting his\nhead on the face of the 1s\ncaptain, Karmanya. Chaos\nensued as the paramedics\ntook him off the pitch.\nHowever, so determined\nwas Karmanya to steer his\nteam to victory, he was\nback on the pitch for the\nsemi-finals against LSE\n1s. He led by example as\nthe IC 1s opened a lead\nagainst their long-time\nrivals (to whom they lost\nat London Zone), claiming\na 12-8 victory.\nA tight final was on the\ncards. Previous winners,\nthe IC 1s, up against\nprevious Runners Up and\nCentral Zone winners,\nUoB 1s. Game on. Raid\nafter raid. Aggressive defending from both sides.\nHunger for points. Arguments with the refs. The 1s\ntook the lead in the raiding\nbut a defensive surge from\nthe UoB side resulted in\na series of knock-outs\nto the IC 1s side. The IC\ndefenders kept their poise,\nhowever, and put in some\nmesmerising tackles. The\nteam held strong for the\nfinal minutes of the game.\nThe final whistle was\nblown. The ref beckoned\nthe teams over. The score\n\u2013 UoB 1s 15-19 IC 1s!\nNational Champions.\nFourth year running.\n2s bow out in a great\nfinal match\nThe IC 2s found themselves in decidedly the\nmore difficult of the two\ngroups, facing finalists\nfrom previous years: LSE\n1s, UoB 1s, and Kings.\nThe addition of Warwick\nwasn\u2019t ideal either \u2013 a side\nknown for their aggressive\ndefence.\nThe first game was\nclose: a slim loss to KCL.\nNonetheless, the 2s put\nforward some stellar\nKabaddi. Put on the back\nfoot, KCL was saved by\nthe end of the short game.\nThe next game against\nLSE saw the return of\nbad habits from the experienced 2s team. These\nimpacts continued into the\nnext match against UoB,\ndespite the extra five\nminutes allowed between\ngames for the ex-IC medic\nreferee to go and relocate\nsomeone\u2019s shoulder.\nThree losses meant that\nthe 2s knew they weren\u2019t\nin the semis, so had\nnothing to lose going into\ntheir last match. Warwick\n\u2013 a team with a highly\naggressive play-style.\nThe 2s\u2019 composure shone\nthrough: quintessential\nclever Kabaddi, forcing\nand exploiting the opponent\u2019s errors. A spectacular win and a great way to\nend the day for the IC 2s.\n3s keep their spotless\nreputation\nThe pressure was on\nthis year for the IC 3s.\nWith such high praise as\n\u201cliterally the best 3rd team\nin the UK Kabaddi scene\u201d\nresting on their shoulders,\nfollowing a stellar performance last year, they\nwere looking to maintain\na spotless reputation in\n2018.\nThey didn\u2019t disappoint.\nAfter an initial setback\nwith a ten-point loss to\nwild card team Manchester (who haven\u2019t graced\nthe sport for three years\u2026)\nthe 3s rallied to the inspiring words of Neev \u201cPBL\u201d\nTrehan. A good thing too.\nTheir next match was a\nbiggy: LSE 2s. Arch rivals\nof IC Kabaddi. The fire in\nthe belly of this relative-ly-inexperienced team\nwas fuelled, ploughing\nthrough the LSE side to\nan 18-14 victory! Their\nfinal match was against\nthe Birmingham 2s but\nwhat was shaping up to be\na nail-biting game ended\nwith a 14-15 loss.\nSo do the 3s of 2018\ncompare to those of 2017?\nNo. They\u2019re leagues\nahead. IC Kabaddi asked\nthe same critic who gave\nthem such high praise last\nyear and he responded:\n\u201cI have never, in all my\nyears as a professional\nKabaddier, seen a 3s team\nplay like that. These guys\naren\u2019t the best 3s team on\nthe UK Kabaddi scene;\nthey\u2019re the best in the\nworld!\u201d\nWomen\u2019s team fight\nthrough injuries\nThe Imperial women\nhad a tough fight going\nin with a team riddled\nwith injuries and three\nmembers playing for the\nfirst time!\nGame 1: KCL. The\ntone was set for the tournament \u2013 fast and aggressive Kabaddi. IC started\nthe game with fantastic\ntackles. Unfortunately, the\nlead was lost at the end,\nwith KCL winning 15-17.\nLSE 2s were next.\nWith the new IC members\ngaining confidence, this\nmatch saw some slick\nraids and crunching\ntackles. This was reflected\nin the result \u2013 a 15-15\ndraw against the LSE\n2s. The final was against\nlong-time rivals and the\nteam to beat \u2013 LSE 1s.\nWhile IC raided hard and\ntackled harder, the final\nscore stood at 9-18.\nThe heightened\nstandard of Kabaddi\nshown by the women\nwas terrific. The women\nwill continue to train hard\nin anticipation of their\nrematch against LSE 1s\nat the City Varsity. Watch\nthis space.\nThe Kabaddi squad celebrating after their day of success // IC Kabaddi\nSquad goals // IC Kabaddi\n\n"

But how can\ngood progress be transformed into great\nprogress? As one who never settles for\n\u201cgood enough\u201d, I have outlined key Action\nAreas to turn good into great: From food\nJoshua Jackson prices on campus to the availability and\nquality of aid from our Careers Service\nand even the conditions of department\nbuildings, I am ready to bring the issues\nthat matter to you to the table. Moreover,\nI am dedicated to making the decision\n- making processes of the Board of\nTrustees more transparent and even\nmore accessible to you.

I\u2019m running\nfor Student Trustee with a single issue\nin mind: transparency. I want our Union\nto actually represent student interests,\nmake decisions democratically, and be\nbold enough to challenge College when\nit gets things wrong. None of these things\nAbhijay Sood\nHaving worked closely with the Officer\nTrustees this year as a Welfare Officer\nand member of Union Council, I\nunderstand the ways our Union can be\nfine-tuned to better meet the needs of\nindividual students, as well as our clubs\nand societies.

Similarly, serving as\nboth a Treasurer and Secretary on Club\ncommittees during my time at Imperial,\nI am aware of the challenges facing\nstudents stepping forward for senior\npositions within their Societies having\nwitnessed many of them myself. Based\non this, I can be expected to offer a firm\nyet pragmatic voice as your Student\nTrustee; using my experience to best\nportray the perspectives of individuals\nthemselves or entire Clubs and Societies,\nwhilst framing this within the context\nI have as a Senior Union Volunteer to\ndetermine the most reasonable solutions\nto problems arising at Board of Trustees\nmeetings. A vote for Naulls is a vote for\nexperience and transparency: a strong\nand reasonable voice for ALL Imperial\nstudents. Your voice. Your Union.\n#VoteNaulls #NaullsInHalls\nCandidate Manifestos: Student Trustees\nThe Board of Trustees is the Union\u2019s\nhighest body, able to overturn any\ndecision made by any other part of the\nUnion. Yet, rather than being an open\nand democratic body, it is often closed\nand opaque. Democracy is at the core\nof what a Students\u2019 Union should be,\nyet the Board regularly implements\nsweeping changes with minimal or no\nconsultation with anyone outside of its\nown membership. As the current Council\nChair, I have sat on Trustee Board for the\npast year, and, although a great deal of\nOwen Heaney good work has been done, there is still\nmuch to be done to ensure that the\nUnion is truly democratic and makes\ndecisions which are right for students.\nI am asking for a second term on the\nBoard so that I have the opportunity\nto use my experience from this year to\nmake sure that the Union\u2019s democracy\nis strengthened by the Board, not\ndiminished. If elected as the students\u2019\nrepresentative on the Board of Trustees,\nI will: * Speak up against implementing\nlarge-scale changes without consulting\nstudents and volunteers * Ensure that\nthe outcomes of the Governance and\nLiberation Reviews are implemented in\nfull and in a timely fashion * Open up\nthe Board by making sure that details of\nits meetings and decisions are published\nin a timely manner and adequately\npublicised\nA vote for me is a vote for democracy -vote for Owen Heaney as your Student\nTrustee.\n\n"

The start of the\nmatch saw RSM receive\nthe kick-off and, following a poor exit, CSM\nwent over the line within\nthe first few minutes.\nThe worst possible start.\nThis was compounded by\nthe loss of RSM stalwart\nRuairi Dunne to a broken\nhand. The RSM did\nhowever fight back with\nstrong phase play leading\nto a number of penalties.\nThis drove RSM deep\ninto CSM territory, where\nwe got our just reward\nwith Harry Allingham\nbeing bundled over for a\ntry from a driving maul\nto take the score to 5-5.\n\u201cUnlike the\nmud bath two\nyears ago, the\npitch was dry\nand well suited\nto the free-flowing game\nof the RSM\u201d\nRSM continued mounting\npressure and Allingham\nshould have had a second\nfrom a driving maul, had\nit not been held up. Eventually CSM turned over\nthe ball and momentum\nshifted to them. Numerous\nline breaks, in particular\nfrom the CSM number 8,\ntook them into the RSM\ntwenty-two; although\nthe defence was strong,\nparticularly from the likes\nof Will Aynsley, Martin\nHead, and Nathan Tomlinson, CSM managed\nto score again to take the\nscore to 12-5 following\na couple of disallowed\ntries, much to the credit\nof the RSM defence. A\nlate penalty from CSM\nmeant the half-time score\nwas 15-5. A particular\nhighlight from the first\nhalf was Alex Amato\n\u2018gerrarding\u2019 the ball into\nthe CSM crowd \u2013 shame\nit missed them all.\nRSM came out in the\nsecond half still confident\nof turning around the\ndeficit. However another\npoor start led to an early\nsecond half try from CSM\ntaking their lead out to\n22-5. RSM knew they had\nto score next to get back\nin the game. The next part\nof the match saw RSM\nplay some quality rugby.\nAmin Omarouayache,\nRSM could well have\nscored and found themselves back in the game.\nThis didn\u2019t, however,\ndamp the RSM spirits and\nmore quality hands led\nto more chances, but as\nhas been seen throughout\nthe season, the chances\ncouldn\u2019t be converted into\npoints. As time began to\nrun out, CSM regained\nthe ball and took their\nchances. Two tries and a\npenalty in the last twenty\nminutes put the game\nto bed with a final score\nof 35-5, making it two\nunsuccessful away trips to\nCornwall in a row.\nAlthough the bottle had\nbeen lost, it was not going\nto stop the RSM boys from\nhaving a quality afternoon\nand evening.

You\nIn The Whites\u2026\nImperial College Musical Theatre Society\u2019s latest production features a predominantly\nwhite cast pretending to be Latino in a musical intended to promote representation of this\nmarginalised community.\nCOMMENT\nAnonymous\nComment Writer\nA\ncting is about\ninhabiting another person\u2019s\nlife. When\nstories explore universal themes \u2013 most of\nShakespeare fits this category \u2013 few would disagree\nthat an actor can give an\ninsightful performance in\nthese stories, regardless of\ntheir ethnic background.\nThe appeal of \u201ccolour\nblind\u201d casting, however,\ncollapses entirely when\ntelling the stories of mar-ginalised groups.\nLin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s\nIn The Heights follows\nthe routines, dreams, and\nstruggles of the mostly\nLatino inhabitants of\nWashington Heights,\nManhattan. Far from the\nuneducated, sexualised\nthugs Latino actors are\noften forced to play,\nthese characters are fully\nrealised characters written\nby a man who shares their\nbackground. Miranda\nhas used In The Heights\nand Hamilton (which\nvery deliberately casts\nnon-white actors as America\u2019s founding fathers) to\nempower actors who too\nrarely get the opportunity\nto inhabit three-dimen-sional characters with\ntheir own stories to tell.\nIn MTSoc\u2019s production of In The Heights,\nhowever, the majority of\nroles are played by white\nactors. This includes\nBenny, a young black\ndriver whose love interest\u2019s parents disapprove\nof their relationship due\nto his race. One Spanish\nactor has been cast in the\nshow, although \u2013 to the\nbest of my knowledge \u2013\nnone of the cast or directorial team is Latino.\nnot vindicate the groups\nchoosing to do it.\nEthnicity is not a\ncostume; it is something\nyou live with. Even if\nyou are not painting your\nface with shoe polish\nand wearing an afro wig,\nputting on an ethnicity\nand taking it off when\nthe curtain falls is just as\ndisingenuous, if not as\ncrassly offensive.\nThe cast of MTSoc\u2019s In\nThe Heights is not entirely\nwhite. A sizeable fraction\nof the cast is Asian, but\nAsians and Latinos are not\ninterchangeable, slightly\ntan ethnic minorities. This\ntraditionally white roles\nto all, but is hoggish and\noppressive when it means\nerasing representation for\nspecific minorities within\na musical meant to do the\nvery opposite.\nMTSoc know that they\nwould not have enough\nblack students signing up\nfor them to cast Hairspray\nappropriately. If they\nknew they would not be\nable to give the majority\nof roles to Latino students,\nwhy attempt to put on a\nmusical about Latinos?\nN.B.: This is not the MTSoc production, in case you hadn\u2019t guessed\u2026 // Flickr/Steven Pisano\n\u201cIt has\nresulted in an\nuncomfortable\nproduction\nfeaturing\nwhite\nperformers\nrapping with\ngeneric Latino\naccents\u201d\nshort-sighted mistake has\nbeen made before \u2013 such\nas when Mexican actor\nRicardo Montalb\u00e1n played\nKhan Noonien Singh in\nStar Trek II: Wrath of\nKhan \u2013 and should not be\nmade again.\nImperial College is\namong the most diverse\nuniversities in the country,\nand, to its credit, MTSoc\nhas never shied away from\ncasting their most talented\nperformers as traditionally white characters no\nmatter their ethnicity.\nColour blind casting can\nbe good for representation when it opens up\nThis has resulted in an\nuncomfortable production\nfeaturing white performers rapping with generic\nLatino accents and\nboasting of their diverse\nSouth American heritage.\nSome cast members have\nposted on social media\nmaking light of the fact\nthat they are pretending\nto be Latino. Perhaps this\nindicates self-awareness\nand embarrassment, but\nthen again, perhaps not.\nOther theatre companies have made the\nsame mistake: last year\na semi-professional\nAustralian production\nof In The Heights was\ncancelled after being\nflooded with criticism\nfor its prominently white\ncast (which still had more\nLatino cast members than\nMTSoc\u2019s production). In a\ntweet, Miranda acknowledged that primarily\nwhite productions of In\nThe Heights are the price\nto pay for making the\nrights available. This does\n\u201cColour blind\ncasting can\nopen up white\nroles, but is\nhoggish and\noppressive\nwhen it erases\nrepresentation\nfor specific\nminorities\u201d\n\n"

He\u2019s\nan American artist who\ncombines a wide range\nof media into large-scale\nsculptures, books, and\ninstallations. His work\ndeals with the ideas,\npractices, and institutions\nsurrounding naturalists\nand natural history; he\nhas filled the three rooms\nof his solo exhibition at\nWhitechapel Gallery with\nan eclectic collection\nof flags, drawings, text,\nprops, live birds, photo-graphs, mannequins, and\nposters.\nI walked into this\nexhibition hoping to find\nrelevant, contemporary\nwork engaging with society\u2019s complex relationship\nwith the natural world.\nInstead, I found a series\nof cinematic stage sets\ndesigned to invoke dated\nfantasies of eccentrics\nand intellectuals, who,\nlike Dion himself, appear\ncontenttoco-optthevisual\naesthetics of biology and\nnatural history without\nregard for the discipline or\nwonder essential to either\nfield.\nIn The Naturalist\u2019s\nStudy, Dion has decorated\na room with couches,\ndrawings, illustrations,\nand sculptures, turning\nthe gallery space into\ndrawing room from two\nhundred years ago. The\nd\u00e9cor is intended to evoke\nthe aura of a 19th\ncentury\nnaturalist, and the room\u2019s\nprops stand in as treasures\ncollected from exotic\ntrips overseas. Some of\nthe work included makes\npassing hints at a conservationist frame of mind:\na black and white series\nof photographs depicting\nstuffed polar bears lines\none wall. Other inclusions\nthrow the fa\u00e7ade out the\nwindow: all of the tables\nare covered edge to edge\nwith books Dion has\npublished, and which are\non offer from the gift shop\ndownstairs. No comment,\neither, on the daring\nexplorers (or their collec-tions) who thrived on the\npeak of natural history\u2019s\nimperialist wave.\nA giant black metal\nbirdcage dominates the\nfirst of the gallery\u2019s four\nrooms. In the cage\u2019s centre\nstands the barren trunk of\na large tree, and around it\nlies a collection of books\nand objects related to the\nstudy of birds. 22 live\nzebra finches (Taeniopy-gia guttata) and up to four\nhuman visitors at a time\n(the maximum allowed in\nthe cage) move through\nthe space, and bring life\nto Dion\u2019s fabricated world\nof sets and props. The\npiece, called The Library\nfor the Birds of London\ngrasps halfheartedly at\none metaphor or the other\nfor the human condition,\nbut its real strength is in\nits physical presence. It\u2019s\na beautiful piece \u2013 black\nmesh around barren\nbranches \u2013 and the care\nwith which Dion and his\nteam have attended to\nthe health and wellness\nof the birds is made clear\nin the long list posted on\nthe gallery wall, titled\n\u2018Commonly Asked Questions about the Birds\u2019.\nIn the third room of the\nexhibition, I found the\nmost exciting and conceptually elegant piece of the\nnight, a work from 1999\ntitled Tate Thames Dig.\nDion and a crew of volunteers dredged the topsoil\nof two tidal beaches near\nthe Tate Britain and the\n(then still to be built) Tate\nModern. Everything they\nuncovered, from horse\nteeth to oyster shells,\nbullets, leather soles, toys,\nceramic fragments, rings,\neven a message in a bottle,\nare kept in an enormous,\ndouble-sided wooden\ncabinet. The results of\neach excavation site are\nkept on shelves and in\ndrawers on either side of\nthe cabinet. Visitors are\ninvited to walk around the\npiece, open drawers, and\nview all the specimens\nunder glass, which are\nsorted into what Dion calls\n\u201ctaxonomies\u201d: organized\ngroups based on material,\nfunction, color, topology,\nand morphology.\nA fusion between\nmuseum exhibit and\narchaeological dig, Tate\nThames Dig successfully\nbrings together the visual\naesthetics and physical\nprocesses of natural\nhistory. Here, Dion finally\ncarries out the tasks of\ncollecting and sorting\nthat are essential to the\nwork of naturalists and\ntaxonomists. By actually\nleaving his studio to experience the natural world\nand practice the scientific\nwork he celebrates in the\nrest of this exhibition,\nDion adds content and\nweight to his stage sets.\nThe fragments of\n\u201cDion has\ntaken the\nfantasy of\nthe armchair\nbiologist out\nof the study\nand into the\nsunlight \u201d\nLondon on display in\nthe collection from the\ndredging are a celebration\nof the capital\u2019s history\nand our relationship with\nnature and each other. The\ncare taken to organize\nevery object is an almost\njoyful mirroring of the\nprocess natural scientists\nhave used to understand\nthe mysteries of life and\nthe world around us. At\nlast, Dion has taken the\nfantasy of the armchair\nbiologist out of the study\nand into the sunlight by\nthe Thames. Only by\ngetting dirty and really\nengaging with the worlds\nwhose language he adopts\ncan Mark Dion get out of\nhis own study and share\nwith us what there is to\nsee.\nARTS\nNicolas Baird\nArts Writer\nWhere?

As the RSM\nteam warmed up, the\nentrance of the CSM team\nand their respective warm\nup procedures struck an\nunprecedented fear at the\nhearts of RSM: it would\nso happen that the \u2018true\u2019\nCSM badminton team did\nnot venture to London the\nprevious year, and hence\nthe 1-8 loss of CSM was\neffectively a forfeit, with\nthe CSM lacrosse team the\nsubstituted victims. This\nyear, the players put forth\nby the CSM side were\nhighly skilled and possessed flawless technique\n(albeit their questionable\nsportsmanship in playing\nfour men and two women\nin violation of the stipulated rules of an equal mix,\nin addition to a few members not even being part of\nCSM, hailing instead from\nthe foreign departments of\nEnglish and Media), heavily punishing the weaker\nabilities of the RSM side.\nAs quickly as the impressions of an easy victory\nwere shattered, they were\nreplaced with the good\nspirits and sportsmanship\nof the RSM side, who\npersevered against the\nunstoppable force of the\nCSM team, clutching\npoints where possible.\nThe players had to adapt\ntheir game to the significantly higher level faced,\nwith more power required\nto return the oppositions\u2019\nshots, and increased attention to placement as to\nnot allow the opposition\nto capitalise on weak\nclears and high drops\nshots. So intense was\nthe competition, that in\nthe first game, Vimbai\u2019s\nstrings were sacrificed in\norder for RSM to attain a\nhard-fought second point.\nHer backup racket left her\nat a severe disadvantage\nfor her and Mustafa\u2019s\nremaining games, but they\npersisted nonetheless.\nThe other two pairs were\nconstituted of Humzah\nand Annie, and Haris\nand Evelyn respectively,\nwho all stepped up their\ngame to the competition\nand played excellently.\nAlthough the trophy was\nlost, with the final score\n9-0 to CSM, all of the\nplayers thoroughly enjoyed the experience and\na high level of badminton\nwas displayed for both\nthe RSM team to improve\nand spectators to enjoy;\nleaving all the more motivation to win it back next\nyear (if CSM bothers to\nsend their actual team).\nA\nfter a 7am\nstart, a long\njourney down\nto Cornwall,\nand a tense football game,\nRSM Netball were ready\nto take on their CSM\ncounterparts. An indoor\ncourt was more than\nwelcome against the cold\nCornish weather but it\nmeant contending with\nsome very loud support-ers. RSM won the coin\ntoss and Laura kicked off\nthe match with the first\ncentre pass. However,\nthe CSM support proved\nto be just as intimidating\nas their shooters and we\nfinished the first quarter\nwith a disheartening 10-0\nscore line.\nThe late arrival of\nCharlotte, our goal\nkeeper, straight from her\nfinal exams, along with\nsome extra supporters\n(and our trusty RSM\nNetball flag) did wonders\nto boost our moral. We\ngot back on court for the\nstart of the second quarter\nwith our heads held high.\nthat streak going. Before\nCSM knew it, we stepped\nup our game and fought\nback their advances with\nincredible finesse. This\ntime the CSM support had\nnothing on our own - and\nwe definitely gave them\nsomething to cheer about.\nThe score in the second\nquarter was a thrilling 7-7,\nbringing the score at half\ntime to 17-7.\nIn the third and fourth\nquarters, we recognised\nthat we had lost the\nelement of surprise.\nAlthough the RSM team\nfought valiantly, CSM\nremained the victors of\nthe Bottle Match and the\nNetball win eluded us for\none more year. However,\nwith a score of 31-14,\nit is exciting to mention\nthat this is the closest\nRSM Netball has come to\nwinning the Bottle Match\nso far. Year on year we\ncontinue to narrow down\nthat goal difference. The\nimprovement just goes\nto show how the team\nis developing and, who\nknows?

Our Bottle\nMatch debut last year saw\nus win 10-3 at home, but\nnow that we were away,\nsurely a bigger challenge\nawaited us!\nAfter seeing off the\nheart-pounding draw\nof the Men\u2019s Hockey,\nthe entire squad commandeered a coach and\nimmediately set off from\nPenzance to Penryn.\nArriving to the pitch\nwith about 30 minutes to\nwarm up did not deter our\nspirits. We got straight\ninto our warm-up and\nstraight into setting up\nthe goal we brought over\nfrom London!\nWith goals from\nArianna Guppy, Charlotte\nMorphet, and Charlotte\nHampson, we quickly\nfound ourselves at the\nend of the first quarter\n4-1 up, with the crowd\ngoing wild. Going into the\nsecond quarter the game\nbecame much scrappier,\nand the conditions of the\npitch did not help with\nthe ground balls \u2013 in fact\nwe saw more grounded\nplayers then picked up\nground balls. Fresher\nStephen Kwong found\nhimself bagging a goal\nafter winning a ground\nball and rolling through\nCSM defences.\nWith two quarters re-maining, CSM stepped up\ntheir play (and fouls) and\nscored at the start of the\nthird quarter.

The\nHero and Legend of\nthis amazing match was\nArianna Guppy, for her\noverall dominance of\nthe game. Stephen \u201cThe\nMighty Kwong\u201d Kwong\nhad also received nominations for his goal, and\nLygon Bowen-West was\nan unsung hero for his\nfantastic saves during the\ngame and general shutting\nout of most goals from the\nCSM\u2019s attack.\nWe can\u2019t wait for the\ngrowth of the club over the\nnext year and of course,\nour third Bottle Match\nappearance, next year, at\nhome in Harlington!\nTo keep up to date with\nRSM Lacrosse, follow us\non Instagram: @rsmla-crosse\nCSM rally means RSM football\u2019s drought continues\nA\nfter last\nyear\u2019s result\nat Harlington\n(1-1, first goal\nin 6 years), the team was\nlooking to build on that\nperformance and bring\nhome the first RSM victory since 2005. RSMAFC\nwent down to Cornwall\nundefeated in 7 games\nwith their strongest squad\nin recent memory.\nIn sunny but cold conditions on the infamously\nboggy Dracaena Centre\npitch, CSM kicked the\ngame off a little cautious-ly. With the pitch immediately proving the biggest\nproblem for both teams\nit was clear the game\ncould only be played\nin one way: the surface\nbeing too uneven to play\nany building football,\nRSMAFC decided to\npack the middle with a\ndiamond playing two\nup front. This worked to\ntheir advantage as they\nstarted strongly setting\nup camp in the opposition\nhalf. The early pressure\ntold as RSM centre back\nSam Mitchell sent a\nheader cashing against the\ncrossbar. CSM\u2019s tentative\nstart continued as they\ngave away sloppy fouls\nand RSM kept on pilling\non the pressure from\nset pieces. Corner after\ncorner, free kick after free\nkick, RSM wasted clear\nopportunities to take the\nlead \u2013 missed chances\nthey would come to rue.\nOn the 35 min mark CSM\nwent long from a free kick\nwithin their own half. A\nlapse in concentration\nfrom RSM centre back\nGeorge Decaudaveine left\nthe CSM striker straight\nthrough on goal to calmly\npoke past the keeper. 1-0\nCSM completely against\nthe run of play, but RSM\nheads didn\u2019t drop determined to fight back. The\ngoal proving to be just a\nblip, RSM continued to\nplay with high intensity,\nwinning most duels and\npenning CSM back into\ntheir half. It was just\nbefore the half-time\nwhistle that RSM reaped\nthe rewards for their\ndetermined play. A free\nkick from George Decaudaveine was whipped into\nthe second post, missing\neveryone in the box to\nnestle just inside the side\nnetting. RSM were right\nback in it and went into\nhalftime hungry to get the\nwin.\nThe match being very\nmuch a game of two half\nhalves, CSM came out\nfor the second half on the\nbetter side of pitch and\nthe better team. The pitch\nreally told in the second\nhalf as RSM started to\ncome out second best on\nthe duels and this translated on pitch to CSM dominating the second half.\nA miscommunication at\nthe back and fluky header\nlater they were 3-1 up and\nkept the trophy.

(I mean,\nI always have an excuse,\ndon\u2019t I?) I experimented\nwith new ideas and tried\nnew ingredients and culinary zones so I can come\nhere today and present\nnew tested recipes. So,\nwithout further ado, here\nwe go on a nice journey\nthat to me \u2013 an Eastern\nEuropean \u2013 brings to the\ntable food that I am not\nused to. They are fairly\nfamiliar to some students,\nand who knows, maybe\nthey can come and improve them.\nMANGO AND CHICKEN STIR FRY\nYou will need...\n\u2022 800g chicken breast, cut into\ncubes\n\u2022 3 tbsp oil\n\u2022 1 tbsp cornstarch\n\u2022 2 tbsp soysauce\n\u2022 400g green peas\n\u2022 2 tbsp honey\n\u2022 Salt\n\u2022 Pepper\n\u2022 3 mangos\n\u2022 1 medium red onion\n\u2022 1 jalapeno\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp. fresh ginger\n\u2022 1 tbsp hot pepper sauce\n\u2022 2 tbsp lime juice\n1. In a large bowl, mix the mangos, red onion, jalape-nos, fresh ginger, hot pepper sauce, and lime juice. This\nis a trickiest part, as you should blend them in order to\nget a smooth texture \u2013 I assume that if you chop them\nwell enough, you can use them in a cruder version, as\nlong as you do not mind it. Season to taste with salt and\npepper.\n2. An alternative would be to find mango salsa to buy if\nyou look hard enough.\n3. In a bowl, combine the chicken, 1 tbsp oil, corn-starch, and half the soy sauce. Make sure that all the\nchicken is covered and let rest for at least 10 minutes \u2013\nconsider that you might want to keep the chicken in the\nfridge is it\u2019s longer.\nKatsudon and egg rice bowl\nYou will need...\n\u2022 Pork chops (boneless, the kind you\nwill find in any shop \u2013 not very\nthick ones, however)\n\u2022 Salt\n\u2022 Pepper\n\u2022 Flour\n\u2022 3 eggs\n\u2022 1 cup breadcrumbs (originally\npanko, but it\u2019s easier to find plain\nbreadcrumbs than the Japanese\nversion)\n\u2022 Oil\n\u2022 \u00bd cup dashi stock (can also be replaced by ordinary chicken stock)\n\u2022 2 tbsp sugar\n\u2022 1 tbsp soy sauce\n\u2022 2 tsp Mirin (you can try replacing\nit with some sweet rice wine, but\nI cannot guarantee that this is a\ngood idea)\n\u2022 1 onion\n\u2022 White rice\n\u2022 1 scallion\nAs you can see from the ingredients list, but there are a couple that are very\nspecific. I believe that some of them (if not all) can be easily replaced with\nwhat you find at any corner shop, but the good thing about London is that\nyou should find them easily.\n1. Start by seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper. After mixing\nthe egg, dust the chops with a bit of flour and then coat them with the egg.\nFinally, coat them with the panko/breadcrumbs, until you get an even\nlayer. Remember to put the breadcrumbs and egg in a shallow bowl so\nyou can easily do this step.\n2. Cook the pork in hot oil \u2013 you can check if it\u2019s hot enough by seeing\nif a breadcrumb sizzles. For ~1cm thick chop, you should fry it 5-6 mins\non each side or until golden brown.\n3. Drain the extra oil on a plate lined with a paper towel.\n4. In the same pot (it should still have the oil and all the juice from the\nmeat) add the finely chopped onions until it is slightly caramelised. Pour\nthe stock, sugar, soy sauce, and Mirin over the onions.\n5. Cut the pork chops and place over the onion, while the cooker is on\nmedium heat.\n6. In a bowl, beat the remaining two eggs and add them in the pan, drizzling them over everything. Cook until they are set.\n7. Serve over a bowl of steamed white rice (to be fair, I just buy a pack\nof pre-cooked rice and I microwave it as I am too lazy to cook rice).\nFOOD\nAndrada Balmez\nFood Editor\n4. Boil the green peas for 3-5 minutes.\n5. Heat a pan on high.Add the remaining oil and,when\nhot enough, add the chicken and cook (depending on\nhow big the cubes are this should take 6-10 minutes).\n6. When cooked properly, add the boiled green peas,\nmango salsa, remaining soy sauce, and the honey. Mix\nwell and allow to cook for another 2-4 minutes.\n7. Finally, season with salt and pepper.\n8. I recommend serving it with some white rice, as\nyou will be able to enjoy the sweet and spicy taste better \u2013 but if you really want, you can try other side-dish-es, too. Don\u2019t forget to enjoy!\nI was a bit reluctant about the combination of\nmango and chicken in the beginning, but now\nI love it as it is a great mixture between sweet\nand spicy food. This is obviously not an original recipe, but since I had it for the first time\nin a restaurant, I tried a lot of variations I could\nfind online and I would like to think that this\nvariation is the best.\nBefore saying anything else about this recipe, I have to admit that\nthis resembles much European cuisine and that, generally, there\nare very many similar dishes in most countries \u2013 in the end, this\nis only a pork cutlet. But the Japanese version has something\nspecial to it, mostly because the rice complements so well the soy\nsauce and the mirin.\n\n"

The girls were\npunctual as always, and\nat 7am they went to the\nboys tent to find them still\nsleeping! But the boys\noverslept after having a\nnightmare with the tent\nin the strong overnight\nwinds. Agreeing on the\nshorter, easier low route,\nweenjoyedahotchocolate\nin the refuge before setting\noff. We were delighted to\nfind that the terrain was\neven easier than yesterday\nand we completed the\n14km to Refuge di Verdi\nby midday. We were\nhoping to push on to\nRefuge de Prati, 4.5km\ninto tomorrow\u2019s stage,\nand where Max had decided to stay tonight. This\nwould nearly halve the\n1290 metres of climbing\ninvolved in stage 12.\nHowever, another group\nof hikers told us they\u2019d\njust come down from\nthere due to high winds.\nAfter a good half-hour\nreading Asterix & Obelix\nen Corse and playing\ncards with our new\nGerman friends, Felix and\nCaroline \u2013 Ironman triath-letes who were hiking the\nGR20 for their third time.\nWith strong winds\nforecast to continue for\nthe rest of the day, the\nrefuge staff advised us that\nnobody should attempt\nthe high route today, since\nit involves traversing an\nexposed ar\u00eate that would\nbe dangerous in high\nwinds\nDay 12 \u2013 Stage 12\nFelix and Caroline\nsomehow managed to\nconvince us to put ridiculous o\u2019clock alarms\non again to climb up the\nmountain before sunrise,\nbut when we woke up and\nstuck our heads out the\ntents, there wasn\u2019t a star\nin sight. We concluded\nit\u2019d be too cloudy for a\ndecent view so happily\nfell back asleep, setting\noff at a more reasonable\n6am instead. Today\u2019s hike\ninvolved two main climbs\n\u2013 the first up to the refuge\nwe considered staying at\nlast night, at 1820 metres\n(and Punta Mozza slightly\nhigher up), and the other\na steeper boulder-studded\nclimb that zigzagged up to\nMonte Furmicula, at 1981\nmetres. It was just as we\nbegan the final descent\ntowards Refuge d\u2019Usciolu\nthat the rain began, and\nonce it started it did not\nrelent. We miserably\npitched our tents in the\nrain, shivering from the\ncold, and ate our dinner\nin bed before going to\nsleep at 5pm (well trying\nto sleep anyway\u2026). The\nnight that ensued was\none of the worst any of\nus could recall. Water\npooled under our tents\nand our flip-flops could\nbe seen floating in the\nouter. Everything got wet,\nand even in all our layers\nand our survival blankets\nwe were freezing in our\nsleeping bags. But it was\nthe boys, and Harry in par-ticular, who had it worst.\nAfter feasting on the world\nfamous Corsican cheese,\nwhich according to some\nauthors (see Uderzo et\nGoscinny, 1973) has the\npower to defeat an entire\nRoman legion, he was\nill and threw up all over\nhis sleeping bag, hiking\nboots, and tent. Georgios\nwas not best impressed!\nDay 13 \u2013 Stage 13/14\nThat morning was the\nlowest point of the expe-dition.\nThe rain had stopped\nand the sun was shining,\nbut it was still very cold.\nDuring the night, the boys\ncovered themselves with\ntheir survival bags, as the\nwater pooling bellow the\ntent had a freezing effect.\nHowever, they didn\u2019t\naccount for perspiration\nand when they woke up,\nany clothes that were not\nwet because of the rain\nwere wet because of their\nsweat. To top that they had\nto climb a 100m cliff in\norder to get the icy water\nneeded for the tent to be\ncleaned.\nTensions between\nthe members were high,\nand understandably so.\nNo one had a relaxing\nsleep and as girls were\nonce again ready on time\nso they had to wait for\naround an hour, and were\nnot pleased. However,\nafter they learned about\nlast night they were more\nunderstanding and helped\nthe boys pack up faster!\nDespite our intentions\nto double today, everyone\nwas feeling quite grim,\n\u201cAfter 30 mins\nof debating\nwhether to\npush on or\nnot, Georgios\ngrabbed the\nbull by the\nhorns and we\nflipped a coin\u201d\nof debating whether to\npush on or not, Georgios\ngrabbed the bull by the\nhorns and we flipped a\ncoin\u2026 tails we\u2019re staying.\nSo we spent the rest of\nthe afternoon by the fire\n\u201cAfter feasting\non the world\nfamous\nCorsican\ncheese, Harry\nwas ill and\nthrew up over\nhis tent\u201d\nThe barren landscape // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nso we were unsure as to\nwhether we\u2019d be up for\nthe double stage, but we\ndidn\u2019t have to decide until\nthe turning, which was\ntwo hours into the day.\nOur kit was wet from the\nnight from hell last night\nso our bags were heavier\nand the going was very\ntough as we scrambled\nacross the ar\u00eate. We eventually found our rhythm\nthough, and gritted\nthrough both stages. It\nwas the afternoon ascent\nof Monte Alcudina that\nreally challenged us.\nBefore the climb even\nbegan we\u2019d already had\na long day\u2019s undulating\nhike; the incline was\nnever ending and seemed\nto get perpetually steeper.\nAs more mountains kept\nappearing above us,\neven Harry (who usually\npowers up the ascents)\nwas left broken and\ncollapsed in a heap at the\ntop! We were glad to see\nRefuge d\u2019Asinau only a\nshort descent from the\npeak and spent the evening\ndesperately trying to get\nwarm in the communal\ntent space with the other\nhikers. Another cold night\nensued and everyone\nexcept Carla (who seems\nto sleep through absolutely anything) were\nkept awake by hail and a\nthunderstorm which left\nthe mountain covered in\nice and snow when we\nawoke the next morning.\nence the boys were ready\non time! Perhaps even\nslightly before Diane and\nCarla, so they claimed.\nWe set off, actually as\nplanned, at 9am for the\nhigh route. Only 8km\nlong, it involved a steep\nascent up to Aiguilles de\nBavella which provided\na beautiful view over the\nEast and South Coast from\nthe rocky towers at the\nsummit. The penultimate\nday of our expedition and\nwe got our first peek of the\nfinish. The descent was\nfull of day walkers, filling\nus with anticipation of the\nsmall taste of civilisation\nwaiting for us in Village\nde Bavella at the foot of\nthe mountain. We could\nalmost smell the pizzeria\n(which had a working\noven this time \u2013 thank\ngoodness!). Only 2.5km\nof hiking away, it took\nnearly two hours for us to\ncomplete the incredibly\nsteep, rocky descent involving the use of chains\nin places. One part in\nparticular involved a giant\nsloping slab of rock surmounted by an enormous\njammed boulder which\nwe heaved our way up on\nthe chain then squeezed\nthrough a gap at the top.\nOnce the day\u2019s work was\nover, we booked into\nthe gite d\u2019etape (there\nwere no campsites in the\nvillage) and went straight\nfor pizza. We thoroughly\ngorged ourselves in the\nfood we\u2019d been dreaming\nabout for days before\na late afternoon nap to\nrevitalise ourselves for\nthe three course evening\nmeal included with our\naccommodation! It was as\nif tonight was an appetiser\nfor the luxuries we could\nenjoy when we complete\nthe trail tomorrow.\nDay 15 \u2013 Stage 16\nKnowing only a matter\nof hours separated us from\nthe end of the hardest trail\nin Europe, we relaxed\n(perhaps too much) at\nbreakfast, feasting on\nbread and Corsican jams\nand left to the sound\nof live Russian music\nperformed by Harry. We\ntook our time, relishing\nthe last 19km of the GR20\nwith Alex and Mandus,\ntaking in the views for\na final time. We all wore\nour team expedition polo\nshirts and took group\nphotos at every opportu-nity. Our legs were weary,\nespecially Harry\u2019s, whose\nankle was causing him\ntrouble again on the tricky\nterrain, but we pushed\non, reminiscing about our\njourney across the island.\nToday the landscape was\nlike that of a different\ncountry all together, as\nwe descended away from\nthe mountainous spine of\nCorsica and own into the\nforests towards the sea.\nEven the pools we bathed\nin 5km from the end were\ndescribed as \u2018lukewarm\u2019\nin the guidebook. They\nwere by no means any description of warm but they\n\u201cWe eventually\nfound our\nrhythm\nthough,\nand gritted\nthrough both\nstages of the\nclimb\u201d\nDay 14 \u2013 Stage 15B\nIt was a momentous\nmorning \u2013 for the first\ntime in our GR20 experi-were much more bearable\nthan the mountain lakes\nand rivers we\u2019d paddled in\non previous days.The final\nfew kilometres seemed to\nlast forever but eventually\nwe rounded a bend to a\nview of Conca not far\nbelow us. There was a lot\nof excitement and pride\nas we strode down into\nthe village, where we\nwere greeted by\u2026 well\npractically nothing! No\nglorious finish line or\nsouvenir shops. There was\nbarely even a sign to tell\nus where the official end\nactually was! But there\nwas one small bar in the\nvillage where we found\nmany of the hikers we\u2019d\nshared our journey with,\nand just down the road\nwas Max.\nMore than 2 weeks\nof trekking through the\nCorsican mountains had\ncome to an end. We all\nagreed it was one of, if\nnot the, best thing we\u2019d\never done. We\u2019d met\nsome incredible people,\nbonded as a team, learnt\nsome French (perhaps not\nDiane), seen the geology\nof the entire backbone of\nCorsica and, above all,\ncompleted the hardest trail\nin Europe. We\u2019re incredible grateful to Imperial\nExploration Board and\nthe RSM trust for funding\nour expedition, and hope\nour adventure will inspire\nother students to undertake similar challenges.\nHarry after summiting Monte Alcudina // Georgios Chatzitheoklitos\nLast day team photo with our friends, Mandus and Alex.

Yet, for\ntwo hours, in what was the\npenultimate of four sold-out gigs at the Barbican,\nNils Frahm dominated the\nstage only accompanied\nby a remarkable array of\ninstruments that crossed\ngenres as much as musical\neras.\nJumping between\nmore than six keyboards\n\u2013 which ranged from a\ngrand piano to an organ\nto a Roland Juno 60 \u2013 the\nmusician and composer\nused his whole body to\noperate the equipment,\nturning knobs and pushing\nbuttons on the sequencer\nand delay pedals with a\nconfidence and precision that didn\u2019t fail\nto impress.\nOpening with\na few tracks\nfrom his most\nrecent album\nAll Melody\nand closing\nwith the older\nMore, Frahm\nappeared comfortable between\nhis gear, taking\ntime in between\nsongs to\n\u201cpush a few buttons\u201d\nand change the settings\nfor the following track,\nwhile trying \u201cnot to mess\nup\u201d (as he had apparently\ndone the day before). His\nassertive movements and\nplayful words created the\nperfect atmosphere for\njuxtaposition of harmonic\nand rhythmic layers\nlooped with increasing\ncomplexity on top of\nchoral samples, expanding in texture to the point\nof filling up the whole\nauditorium with warm\nand reverberated sounds.\nHis short use of the\ngrand piano as a percussion instrument \u2013 skilfully\nplayed with some toilet\nbrushes (yes, that\u2019s right)\n\u2013 only made me wish he\nhad gone on for longer,\nperhaps indulging less in\nthe piano solos and more\nin dancefloor-friendly intermissions like \u2018#2\u2019. But,\nas he himself was happy\nto admit, people seemed\nto have a particular affection for those of his songs\nthat consisted of \u201cthe\nsame chord played over\nand over for six minutes\u201d.\nAnd it\u2019s hard to deny\nthat it was exactly those\nsongs that allowed his\nlive show to reach a few\nmoments of high lyricism,\ncompared to which the occasional attempts to bring\nin punchier electronic\nkicks, although musically\ninteresting, sometimes\npaled.\nDespite that, Frahm\nperfectly juggled\npost-classical melodies\nwith mesmerising loops\nand powerful bass lines\nlike very few can do.\nAnd after all, if a crowd\nof nearly 2,000 spectators\nsacrificed a rare sunny day\nin London to gather in the\ndark and watch him play,\nit was going to be worth it.\nAt \u00a315 for a student\nticket, I couldn\u2019t have\nasked for a better way\nto spend that cold\nSaturday after-noon.\nI\nt\u2019s been a while since\nI wrote a proper\nreview.\nThis isn\u2019t a proper\nreview.\nThough really, they\nseldom are.\nI\u2019ve listened to this\nalbum twice.\nOnce yesterday while\nI was working, and once\nmore this morning as I\nwalked through the snow\ninto the Felix office. I\nthink it\u2019s pretty great.\nI have neither the time\nnor the expertise to write\na comprehensive piece,\nso I\u2019ll just relay some of\nmy thoughts and feelings\nfrom my journey.\nThe walk normally\ntakes 35 minutes. This\nalbum is 71 minutes long.\nI was taking it slow today.\nHonestly I\u2019d never\neven heard of Car Seat\nHeadrest until recently.\nThough the name does\nfeel familiar.\nI\u2019d hoped that this time\nI\u2019d be able to pay closer\nattention to the music,\nbut honestly I was more\nconcerned with trying to\nstay upright. Making sure\nI didn\u2019t slip and fall and\nbreak my leg and die.\nI survived.\nLondon is very pretty\nin the snow. For about 45\nseconds. Before it turns to\nsludge.\nIt\u2019s not even new. It was\nrecorded back in 2011 on\na laptop. Super lo-fi. I\ndidn\u2019t hear it at the time.\nFor whatever reason, they\ndecided to re-record it.\nI\u2019m glad they did.\nMy socks are wet.\nThe album is angsty\nand fumbling and personal\nand sweet. It\u2019s also quite\nfunny. I like it when bands\nare funny.\nI thought these boots\nwere waterproof. Apparently not.\nOh look there\u2019s.\nRhidian. On the picket\nline. He looks even colder\nthan I feel. I don\u2019t know\nhow he has the energy to\nstand there all day every\nday. Go Rhid.\nI really should listen to\nthat 2011 version.\nOkay I lied a bit. My\nwalk didn\u2019t really take\nme 71 minutes. I started\nthe album before I left the\nhouse. Before I put my\nshoes on. Laced them up\ntight. Today is a bobble\nhat day. Got to the office\nwith 15 minutes left. No\none else was there so I\ncarried on listening.\nSorry, this is hardly a\nreview at all. Though let\u2019s\nbe honest, no one reads\nthese. Except the copy\neditors. Love you copy\neditors.\nThis album feels cosy\nwhile all else crumbles\naround me. I like it a lot.\nFred\u2019s in the office now.\nIt\u2019s good music to\nsoothe an imploding head.\nGod, I hope the snow\nmelts before I go home.\nM.C. Escher didn\u2019t really do hugs, but if he did, I imagine they\u2019d go like this // Matador\nBon Iver has something for everyone\nF\nirst things first,\n22, A Million is\nthe Kid A of this\ngeneration. With\nthat in mind, it is absolutely necessary to see Bon\nIver in their current form.\nPerforming two sets (with\na 22 minute interval) at\nthe Hammersmith Apollo\nwith candles adorning\nthe stage, this night was\na special occasion \u2013 it\nwas intimate and it was\nhomely, despite being just\none of their eight shows\nthere over two weeks.\nNew songs such as\n\u201810 d E A T H b R E a S\nT\u2019 and \u2018715 \u2013 CR\u03a3\u03a3KS\u2019\nwhich are perhaps too experimental (for some) on\nrecord are transcendental\nand evolve into something\nelse in concert, with pitch\nperfect vocals and slight\nchanges to arrangements.\nBut don\u2019t worry, the older\nsongs are amazing to see\nlive too. With folky sing-alongs found in \u2018Skinny\nLove\u2019 and \u2018The Wolves\u2019,\nand songs in which the\ncrowd is so quiet you\ncould hear a pin drop\nbetween breaths such as\n\u2018Woods\u2019, you\u2019ll experience a mix of feelings\nseldom seen in a concert,\nparticularly in this day\nand age of one-note\nbands, such as Fishcat and\nthe Twattymen.\nThere\u2019s lots of head-bobbing and even a little\nbit of dancing in the\ncrowd; a rare sight for a\nband you\u2019re more likely\nto listen to while stoned in\na dark room with the snow\nfalling silently outside,\nthan in a club or a house\nparty. The highlights were\n22, A Million songs \u201833\n\u201cGOD\u201d\u2019 and \u20188 (circle)\u2019.\nPushing the soundsystem\nto the limit (and on a\ncouple of occasions,\npast it) and yet somehow\ngiving me goosebumps\nin the back of my neck\nat the same time, those\ntracks cemented the night\nas a legendary concert.\n\u20188 (circle)\u2019 had a massive\nbuild up with a beautifully performed trombone\nsolo. It was so good, so\nmagical, it\u2019s probably\nwhat summoned the snow\nto London the following\nmorning.\nBon Iver united audiences and genres with a\ncarefully crafted and passionate show. If, by some\nmiracle, you can find\na ticket to a remaining\nnight, seize it immediate-ly. You won\u2019t regret it.\nKing Gizz are exactly as you\u2019d expect: fucking great\nT\nhe queue looped\naround two\ncorners as fans\nwaited eagerly to\npass beneath the dome of\nthe O2 Academy Brixton.\nSpanning the reader-graph above them hailed\nthe cause: Australian\npsych-rockers King\nGizzard and the Lizard\nWizard. Performing their\nonly London show in the\nsupport of the immense\nfive albums they released\nlast year, the show sold\nout quickly, which was\nimmediately noticeable\nupon arrival.\nThe tight packing\nbeneath the stage made\nmoving difficult; the one\nway which was physically\nacceptable to turn was\ntowards the band. Once\nthey came on, however,\nyou didn\u2019t want to look\naway. Starting with the\nfirst single off the first\nalbum of 2017 (Flying\nMicrotonal Banana),\n\u2018Rattlesnake\u2019, the cheers\nfrom the crowd soon\nbecame the chanting of\nthe repetitive lyrics. Much\nlike a snake itself, the pit\nstarted to writhe and sway,\nmany fans losing their\nbalance as the sardines\nattempted to mosh.\nLooming above them\nwere abstract, psychedelic\nprojections synchronised\nto the music, which cast\nluminous colours across\nthe sweat-laden faces of\nthe people beneath.\nAs the 7-piece continued into their first set, the\nenergy of both the music\nand crowd remained high,\nwith neither stopping for\nair if they could avoid it.\nFollowing \u2018Rattlesnake\u2019\ncame the band\u2019s final\nsingle from 2017, \u2018Greenhouse Heat Death\u2019, from\ntheir New Year\u2019s Eve\nreleased album Gumboot\nSoup. Swaying turned\nto jumping. I lost my\nshoe. Jumping turned to\npushing and then back to\nswaying. I lost my sock.\nThe remaining singles\nfrom Flying Microtonal\nBanana, \u2018Nuclear Fusion\u2019\nand \u2018Sleep Drifter\u2019 came\nand went, with no relent\nfrom the crowd.\nSuddenlythemovement\nstopped. The band were\nno longer above. Replacing the enchanting projections was a big red timer,\ncounting down from 15.\nWhat was at the end was\nanyone\u2019s guess. This is\nthe band who record their\nvocals through iPhones.\nThe band who dedicated\na third of an album to\na story about a cyborg\nwho eventually destroys\nthe universe through\nvomiting. This is the band\nwho named themselves\nKing Gizzard and the\nLizard Wizard for fuck\u2019s\nsake. When the timer hit\nzero all eyes were on the\nstage. Fortunately, it just\nmarked the beginning of\nanother set.\nThis set appeared to be\nmore chilled in its ways,\nthe music being slower,\nmore relaxed. This memo\ndidn\u2019t make it to the\ncrowd apparently, where\nthe frantic movement\nand energy previously\nfound did not stop. This\nset included \u2018Han-Tyumi\nthe Confused Cyborg\u2019,\na track from Murder of\nthe Universe, the second\nof 2017\u2019s albums; also\nplayed from this was\n\u2018Welcome to an Altered\nUniverse\u2019 and \u2018The Lord\nof Lightning\u2019. The final\n2017 material exhibited\nthat evening was then\nproduced, the single\n\u2018Crumbling Castle\u2019 and\nthe eponymous \u2018Polygondwanaland\u2019, all from\nthe fourth release of 2017.\nWrapping up the evening,\nKing Gizz resorted to\ntheir critically acclaimed\nNonagon Infinity (2016).\nDescribedasa\u201cnever-ending album\u201d by its vocalist\nStuart Mackenzie, \u2018Robot\nStop\u2019, \u2018Big Fig Wasp\u2019 and\n\u2018Gamma Knife\u2019, arguably\ntheir most famous song,\nwere played in indiscernible fashion to the\nuntrained ear, instead\nforming a punchy energetic end to a kaleidoscopic,\nmind-blowing event, as\nto be expected from this\nwhirlwind of a band.\nHe kept his headphones on fOr MaXiMuM fOcUs // Adrian LaMoury\nMUSIC\nAiden Langan\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: None.\nVenue: Eventim Apollo.\nDate: 25th\nFebruary 2018.\nTicket Price: \u00a336.50\nBON IVER\nMUSIC\nEmily Freeman\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: Mild High\nClub.

The\nnovel is set in Oxford\nUniversity, at around\nChristmas time, 2053.\nA young woman called\nKivrin, a historian, is sent\nback in time to research\nthe past.\nConcerned about the\ndangers of travelling back\nto such an unfamiliar time,\na critical professor warns\nher of all the possible\ndangers she will face \u2013\ndiseases, poor sanitation,\nrape, being burned as a\nwitch\u2026 Yet all of those\nworries prove to be superficial when they realize\nthey made a mistake, and\nshe has actually landed in\nthe year the Black Death\nreached Oxford, in the\nChristmas of 1348! Meanwhile, a mysterious strain\nof influenza is spreading\nquickly back in the Oxford\nof her time, and in the\nensuing panic, it becomes\nuncertain whether anyone\nwill be able to arrange her\nrescue.\nThe best part of the\nnovel is the chapters\nconcerning Kivrin\u2019s\nencounters with people\nfrom 1348, which seemed\nso real that I began to feel\nattached to the characters\nand their village. All of\nthis is brought to a devastating end when, one\nby one, they began to fall\nvictim to the plague.\nMeanwhile back at\nOxford, people react\ncrazily to the influenza\noutbreak, as they try to\nmake sense of it in hilarious ways \u2013 much like\nwhat Kivrin is seeing a\nfew centuries back.\nFunny characters add\nto the panic and confu-sion. Amongst them are\nMrs Gaddson, an overly\nconcerned mother of a\nstudent at the university,\nwho constantly complains\nof poor living conditions,\nand how it must have an\nadverse effect on her son.\nLater on, she takes to\nreading passages about\ndoom and plague from the\nBible to influenza victims.\nAlthough she was entertaining at the start, she\nbecame background noise\nat the end when the author\ndid not allow any more\ndevelopments on her part.\nAnother amusing character is Colin, the young\nnephew of one of the\ndoctors. He walks around\ndisregarding all health\nregulations and ignores\ncommon hygiene practic-es, and treats the influenza\noutbreak as some kind\nof huge adventure. Surprisingly, his personality\nproves to be useful when\nhe is sent on a mission by\nthe staff.\nNonetheless, there\nare several aspects of\nthe novel which could\nbe improved. I found\nthe pretext for time\ntravelling unconvincing.\nWhy would anyone be\nsent back towards such\na dangerous time when\nit is possible to send a\nmachine back instead? Or\njust consult contemporary\nsources? After all, a\nmonk who had apparently\nwritten it all down after\neveryone else died was\nconstantly referred to by\nthe characters. There are\nalso some minor factual\ninaccuracies, which\nlessen the book.\nThe length of the book\nmight be shortened,\nwhilst still delivering the\nmain points, as repeti-tiveness is a major issue\nin the strange influenza\nepidemic chapters. Nonetheless, the book is still\nworth reading for Kivrin\u2019s\ninteractions with a set of\nmemorable medieval\ncharacters.\nBOOKS\nYang Guo\nBooks writer\nThe Black Death still has a lasting impact that will continue beyond 2053 // Wikimedia\nFelix is recruiting!\nWe want you \u2013 yes, you! We\u2019re looking for writers, photographers, editors,\nillustrators, reporters, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team.\nNo experience needed \u2013 we\u2019ll teach you everything you need to know.

Organisers have given club\ncaptains three options for\na new date, and the choice\nwill be communicated to\nstudents in the near future.\nThe move follows\nthe cancellation of this\nweek\u2019s Hockey Varsity,\nwhich was scheduled to\nbe played on Wednesday\nafternoon. In a statement,\nSport Imperial said \u201cHarlington is now under a\nthick layer of snow and\nfrozen over\u201d, and it would\nsend an update later in the\nweek on when the match\nwould be rescheduled.\nTickets for VarsityFest\nshould still be accepted for\nthe rescheduled date, but\nstudents who cannot make\nit will be provided with a\nrefund. Information about\nthe process for refunds\nwill be sent out once the\ndate has been rearranged.\nIn a statement, an\nICU representative said:\n\u201cDue to adverse weather\nconditions which are not\nscheduled to change over\nthe weekend, Sport Imperial and Imperial College\nUnion took the decision\ntoday to postpone the\nannual VarsityFest\ncompetition. We plan to\nre-arrange the event at a\ndifferent time. We are disappointed that the weather\nhas impacted the event\nas such, but the main\nconcern was the playing\nconditions at the grounds\nand at this moment it is\nnot safe to play sport on\nfrozen ground.\u201d\nVarsityFest 2018 was\nscheduled to take place\nthis Saturday, 3rd March.\nThis year the Headline\nmatch will be the Netball\n1s, and the Showcase\nmatch will be Kabaddi.\nThe majority of the\nmatches were scheduled\nto be played outside.\nThe current weather\nhas caused havoc across\nthe country, as strong\nwinds, low temperatures,\nand heavy snow affected\ntransport links. Hundreds\nof flights have been can-celled, and the Met Office\nhas issued a red extreme\nweather warning for snow\nand wind in southwest\nEngland.

They\ntold students: \u201cWe can\nsay with certainty that you\nwill not be examined on\nany material that you have\nnot been taught.\u201d\nI\nmperial\u2019s Centre for\nNeuropsychopharmacology is partly\nfunded by a family\ntrust owned by former\nFormula One boss Max\nMosley.\nMax Mosley-owned trust funding Imperial lab\nThe Alexander Mosley\nCharitable Trust was set\nup in memory of Mosley\u2019s son, who died of a\nsuspected drug overdose\nin 2009. Since then, the\ntrust has donated at least\n\u00a3600,000 to the centre,\nwhich is headed by\nProfessor David Nutt.\nProfessor Nutt\u2019s recent\nwork has looked at the\npotential therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs\nin treating depression.\nThe trust has also\nprovided funding to Dr.\nBen Sessa, a psychiatrist\nresearching the use of\nMDMA as a treatment for\nPTSD. Dr. Sessa was due\nto speak about his work\nyesterday at an event\nhosted by Imperial\u2019s Psychedelic Studies society,\nwhich was cancelled\nbecause of poor weather.\nThe trust has given\nmore than \u00a31 million to St\nPeter\u2019s College, Oxford,\nwhere Alexander Mosley\nstudied. The deputy leader\nof the Labour Party, Tom\nWatson, has also accepted\ndonations totalling more\nthan \u00a3500,000 from the\ntrust. Watson is also in\ncharge of Labour\u2019s policies on press regulation.\nMosley bankrolls the\nstate-recognised press\nregulator Impress via the\ntrust. Only a few small\npublications and websites\nhave signed up to Impress;\nthe majority of national\nand local publications\nare members of the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation (Ipso).\nMosley\u2019s interest in\npress regulation stems\nfrom his successful legal\nbattle against News of\nthe World in 2008. The\ntrial centred on a News\nof the World story about\nMosley\u2019s sadomasochistic\ninvolvement with five\nprostitutes, but Mosley\nwas also questioned\non election literature\npublished for the British\nUnion of Fascists, which\nwas led by Mosley\u2019s\nfather, Sir Oswald Mosley.\nDuring the trial Mosley\nclaimed to have no recollection of publishing\ncampaign leaflets calling\nfor black people to be\ndeported and accusing\nimmigrants of carrying\ndiseases such as leprosy,\nsyphilis, and TB. A copy\nof one of the leaflets carrying the words \u201cpublished\nby Max Mosley\u201d emerged\nearlier this week. Mosley\ncontinued to deny his\ninvolvement in the 1961\nby-election campaign in\nan interview with Channel\n4 News\u2019 Cathy Newman.\nPolice are now assessing\nevidence relating to a\npossible charge of perjury\nagainst Mosley.\nThe College has not\ncommented.\nThe email came two\ndays into the strikes,\nwhich could last up to\n14 days. UCU members\nvoted to take industrial\naction following proposed\nchanges to their pension\nscheme by Universities\nUK (UUK).\nThe email was followed by another message\nfrom Professor Buitendijk\non Thursday, 1st\nMarch\nsaying: \u201cEvery effort is\nbeing made to ensure\nthat the overall goals of\neach module and degree\nprogramme are achieved.\nFor Imperial modules and\nwhere the College has\nfinal authority, I can reiterate my assurances you\nwill not be assessed on\nanything that has not been\ntaught to you as a result of\nstrike action.\u201d\nA number of students\nand staff have voiced concerns over whether or not\nassessments later this year\nwould include material\nscheduled to be covered in\ncontact time cancelled due\nto the strike. In an email\nsent to Prof. Stirling and\nProf. Buitendijk earlier on\nFriday, Professor Michele\nDougherty, head of the\nDepartment of Physics,\nexpressed her worries\nover \u201cuncertainty and lack\nof clarity from College\u201d,\nand asked the College to\n\u201cshow sector leadership\non this matter\u201d.\nOne issue Prof.\nDougherty highlighted\nwas the expectation of\ndepartmental staff to minimise the impact the strike\nwas having on students,\nwhich she said was \u201cunreasonable and unviable\u201d.\nLast week, over 700\nstudents from the Department of Physics alone\nwere affected, as nearly\n60% of lecture contact\nhours and nearly 40%\nof tutorial contact hours\nhad to be cancelled. Prof.\nDougherty urged the\nCollege to \u201censure that\nproductive negotiations\nare reopened between\nUUK and the [UCU]\nwithout any further\ndelay\u201d.\nIn a statement for Felix,\na Union representative\nsaid: \u201cThe Union is glad\nto see the College is\naddressing the concerns\nwe have raised on behalf\nof our members regarding\nthe impact of the current\nstrikes. This is testament\nto the work of staff and\nstudent representatives\nacross the College. We\nhope the College considers the other impacts of\nthese strikes and takes\naction \u2013 urging UUK\nreopen negotiations\nbetween UUK and UCU.\u201d\nAs well as concerns\nover examinations, a\nnumber of student academic representatives\nhave been asking whether\ntuition fees would be\nrefunded as a result of the\nstrike action. A petition\nrequesting a partial refund\nof tuition fees, started by\nstudents in the Electronic\nand Electrical Engineering (EEE) Department,\ncurrently has around\n2,500 signatures. Students\nat other universities have\nstarted similar petitions,\nwith reports of the number\nof students demanding\nrefunds increasing by\n10,000 per day.\nIn the email, Prof. Stirling and Prof. Buitendijk\nsaid: \u201cWe have also heard\nfrom a number of students\nabout their tuition fees\nand we will address this\nconcern in due course.\u201d\nUCU is currently\ntaking industrial action\nover changes to pension\nschemes, which it says\ncould see academics and\nsupport staff losing out on\nthousands of pounds each\nyear.

Platforms:\nMicrosoft Windows,\nPlayStation 4, Xbox One\nDRAGON BALL\nFIGHTERZ\nI\u2019m just saiyan: Dragon Ball FighterZ\nP\nlaying this game\nas a long-time fan\nof Dragon Ball\nZ and the fighter\ngenre, I can say, without a\ndoubt, that DBZ Fighterz\nfeels like a love letter\nwritten to its fans. The\ngame has surpassed both\nlimits and expectations of\nthe fighting game genre,\ngoing even further beyond\nwith spectacular original\nsoundtrack and gorgeous\nvisuals, while at the\nsame time being a perfect\nhomage to its anime. In\nall of its Saiyan glory,\nDBZ Fighterz does have a\nsmall fault in its otherwise\nperfectly rendered abs\nwhich I\u2019ll discuss later.\nNow lets break it down, in\nLucio style.\nThe story begins\nwith the player finding\nthemselves in the (stolen)\nbody of our spikey haired\nprotagonist Goku, due to\na global soul disturbance\nthat has resulted in the\nrest of the God-like\nDBZ cast (especially\nYamcha) being drastically\nweakened. With characters only returning to\ntheir full strength when\nyou control them, (in a\npeculiar, a steroid filled\nversion of Freaky Friday)\nyou progress through\nthe story to unravel the\nmystery that surrounds\nAndroid 21 and her army\nof clones. The story is split\ninto three main arcs, each\ncentred around a different\ncharacter, leading to an\nepic showdown with the\naforementioned android.\nFor a typical fighter the\ncampaign is quite lengthy,\nhowever it\u2019s definitely\nworth a playthrough to\nunlock Android 21 as a\nplayable character.\nUnlike previous games\nin its franchise, DBZ\nFighterz also includes\nthe ability to strengthen\nthe bonds you have with\ncertain characters. This\nimproves their abilities\nand power as well as\nopen up unique dialogue.\nThe campaign also boasts\nout his Saiyan Pride in a\ntestosterone fuelled rage.\nWithout a doubt, this\nis one of the best fighting\ngames of this year and\nmaybe this decade,\nDragon Ball Fighterz\nbrings new innovative\ncombat that feels fresh\nand exhilarating. Consisting of a basic fighting\ngame control scheme\nwith the three primary\nattack buttons, being\nlight, medium, heavy, and\nthe fourth being a special\nmove attack, the simplicity of the controls makes\nit easy for newcomers\nto pick up. Players fight\nin 3-person teams with\nteam mechanics such\nas dynamic switching\nbetween characters and\nassists which can range\nfrom basic attacks to\nsuper moves. The game\nlends a caring hand to\nbeginners by its introduction of auto combos\nwhich require only one\nbutton to be pressed\nmultiple times, providing\nboth decent damage and\nfantastic visuals. This is\nnot to say that the game is\nwithout depth; additional\ninvestment of time and\neffort into mastering\nmore advanced combos\nand being creative with\nin- game mechanics can\nlead to truly terrifying\nresults. Each character\nfeatures their own distinct\nplaystyle, for example\nAndroid 16 who is a bulky\ngrapple type character and\nHit, who is a strong coun-ter-based character.\nThere is plenty to\nlearn and to discover,\nwith unique in-game\ncutscenes triggered by\ncertain actions (recreating\nmoments from the anime),\nas well as some characters\npossessing unique abili-ties. Additional features\nof the combat including\n\u2018Dragon Rush\u2019 which is\nscenes are cinematics that\noccur if you defeat one of\nthe opponent\u2019s characters\nwith a super or heavy\nattack, ranging from your\nopponent hurtling through\npillars of rock or being\nobliterated off the face of\nthe earth.\nDespite my unending\npraise of DBZ Fighterz\nthere is an issue beneath\nits almost perfect form;\nthe online multiplayer can\nbe some of the most rage\ninducing material on the\nplanet, with connection\nissues that can make or\nbreak a match, completely\nruining the spontaneous\nnature of the gameplay.\nWith patches on their\nway, these server issues\nshould be resolved soon,\nbut in the meantime the\noffline options are more\nthan enough to satiate\nyour interest and provide\nendless fun.\nI without a doubt, recommend this game to any\nfighting game enthusiast\nor just a casual Dragon\nBall fan. For me, this\ngame is near perfect but\nit hasn\u2019t reached its final\nform, it\u2019s a combination\nof everything good about\nDragon Ball and the\nfighting genre, however\nthe online latency issues\nlet this masterpiece down.\nThis isn\u2019t even my final form! // Bandai Namco Entertainment\nhilarious interactions\nbetween characters, such\nas the Cell mocking\nNappa for missing out\non the apparent bargain\nsale that is going super\nsaiyan, or the Ginyu force\ngoing into detail about the\nhealth care plan featured\nin Fireza\u2019s (disposable)\narmy.

It\u2019s\neasy to feel she\u2019s describing the crowd as we stand\ncaptivated under dreamy\nstage lights with barely a\nsense of who\u2019s around us.\nThe lyric especially\nresonates with me this\ntime as I watch alone,\nmy company for the\nevening stuck in traffic\non their way to Camden\u2019s\nlegendary Roundhouse.\nThe venue suits the band\nwell: the five-piece fill\nthe stage nicely, bedecked\nwith vintage guitars,\nsynths, and amps in front\nof a hypnotic projected\nbackdrop that resembles\na 70s Doctor Who title\nsequence.\nA distinct step up in\nsize from where they\u2019ve\nperformed on past UK\ntours, they\u2019re playing\nthe sold-out show with\nremarkable cool, their\neffort centred on nailing\nthe technical aspects of\ntheir performance. And\nthis too they do with\nease, the whole band\nplaying flawlessly, with\neach instrument clear and\naudible, and the backing\nvocals loud enough to\nbeautifully mesh with\nRankin\u2019s lead. This is\nperhaps a testament to the\nquality of the sound team\nat Roundhouse as well as\nthe band.\nEither way, they\nsounded excellent. Even\nthe subtle shifts in guitar\ntones and synth textures\nthat made their latest\nrecord such an engaging\ncut compared to much\nof the dream pop scene\nwere perceptible. In fact,\nthe detail and clarity of\nAlvvays\u2019sound here rivals\nsome of the live studio\nperformances they\u2019ve\ndone recently for the likes\nof Seattle alt-rock radio\nstation KEXP.\nBut Alvvays demonstrate that they are a great\nlive act because they\ndon\u2019t stop at perfecting\nthe technicality of the per-formance. Rankin\u2019s quips\nand comments between\ntracks grab smiles as usual\nand continue to cement\nthe view propagated by\nthe band\u2019s online following that Alvvays are the\nglorious pinnacle of Canadian-indie-pop-cuteness.\nAt one point she asks the\naudience for recommendations of things to do\nduring the band\u2019s day-off\nin London: a refreshing\ndisregard of the band\u2019s\ngrowing fame.\nThe 15 song setlist was\ncentred on Antisociallites\nwith nine of the album\u2019s\nten tracks performed (a\ntreat for anyone who\nloved that record as much\nas I did) but kept things\ninteresting with a performance of a new, currently\nunreleased song \u2018Pecking\nOrder\u2019, as well as a cover\nof Elastica\u2019s \u2018Blue\u2019 in\nthe encore, which they\nadapted to their jangly\nsound surprisingly well.\nIn some ways it was\na shame that the band\u2019s\ndreamier tracks set such\na relaxed atmosphere that\nthe audience never fully\nreciprocated the band\u2019s\nhigh energy on their\nheavier tracks, but all in\nall Alvvays delivered a\nfantastic performance that\nwill see them continue\nto climb to the top of the\nindie scene.\nFranz Ferdinand prove that they can still rock\nR\neturning to\nanother sold-out Brixton\nAcademy, Franz\nFerdinand demonstrated\nthat their new material\nis just as capable as their\nback-catalogue of indie\nanthems at getting nearly\nfive thousand people\ndancing. The band are\ntouring their recently released fifth album, Always\nAscending, which is their\nfirst in five years. In that\ntime, the band recorded\nand toured an album with\nAmerican electro-pop\nduo Sparks and then lost\nfounding member and\nrhythm guitarist Nick\nMcCarthy who has been\nreplaced by new members\nDino Bardot (guitar) and\nJulian Corrie (keyboards\nand backing vocals).\nNonetheless, the reconfigured lineup sounded as\ntight as ever on Saturday\nand cracked through an\neighteen song set, half of\nwhich consisted of tracks\nfrom Always Ascending.\nIndeed, Franz Ferdinand\nare wearing their new\nsound and configuration\nwith pride, perhaps as the\nresult of lead singer Alex\nKapranos finally fully\ntaking the centre stage as\nfrontman, allowing his\nbandmates to cement as\nhis backing unit.\nThat said, the core\nelements of a great old-school Franz Ferdinand\ngig were still present:\nKapranos fervently\njumping and striding\nabout the stage, the band\nplaying with impressive\ntightness and energy,\nand the audience feeding\noff this as they sang and\ndanced through bangers\nand ballads alike.\nThey opened with\nthe title track from\ntheir latest LP, before\nswinging through a mix\nof songs spanning their\ndiscography, culminating\nin a 10-minute version\nof \u2018This Fire\u2019, from their\neponymous 2004 debut,\nwhich has long been a\nfavourite gig-closer for\nthe band. The dominance\nof songs from Always\nAscending left little room\nfor anything other than the\ntop hits from Franz Ferdinand\u2019s first four records,\nbut while these songs\u2019\nfamiliarity usually generates the biggest response\nfrom crowds, there was\nno sense of dependence\non them to drive the gig\non this night. Rather, the\nDNA of the newly remade\nfive-piece that produced\nAlways Ascending has\nmade its way into the rest\nof the band\u2019s material\nresulting in a decade and\na half\u2019s worth of great\nsongs presented under\na revitalised sound and\naesthetic.\nA particular highlight\nwas the decision to\nintroduce a saxophone\nplayer in the encore who\nperformed on \u2018Love Illumination\u2019 and soloed in\nthe extended disco outro\nof recent single \u2018Feel the\nLove Go\u2019. In moments\nlike this, Franz Ferdinand\u2019s ongoing ability to\ntake the pop-rock quirks\nthat characterise their\nstudio material to a live\nsetting shines through\nsuch that, across material\nold and new, they are able\nto thrill audiences for a\ncouple of hours \u2013 and it\u2019s\ncertainly worth it.\nHelpfully labelled in case they forgot what the instruments were // Neel Le Penru\nMUSIC\nNeel Le Penru\nMusic Writer\nSupport Artist: Spinning\nCoin.

    "content": "ISSUE 1687\nFELIX\nBOOKS books.felix@imperial.ac.uk\n17\nAn intellectual perspective on progress and positivity\nin Enlightenment Now\nWith the help of the philosophies of the Enlightenment and a wealth of statistics, Steven Pinker\u2019s new book seeks\nto answer questions of the current state of humanity.\nBOOKS\nClemens Jakubec\nBooks writer\nW\nhere is\nthe world\nh e a d e d ?\nAre things\ngetting better or are we\napproaching a darker\nperiod of human his-tory? In his new book\nEnlightenment Now: The\nCase for Reason, Science,\nHumanism, and Progress,\nAmerican cognitive\nlinguist Steven Pinker\nmakes the case for a more\npositive outlook for the\nfuture of humanity.\nHis argument is mainly\nbased on one thing,\nnamely a recollection\nof the four pillars of the\nenlightenment: reason,\nscience, progress, and\nhumanism. Pinker has\nbeen a strong advocate for\nall of them for many years.\nToday the principles of\nthe Enlightenment laid\nout by thinkers such as\nKant, Voltaire, and Hume\nhave become part of the\npublic mindset and their\nideas are so ingrained\ninto people that the actual\noriginal ideas have faded\ninto the background.\nTherefore, Pinker\nargues, it is necessary to\nreformulate and remind\nourselves of all the values\nthe Enlightenment stands\nfor. Humans are not naturally rational animals, but\nthrough the establishment\nof rules and norms, democracies and markets,\nlaws and constitutions, a\nfree press and scientific\nsocieties we are capable\nof living up to the ideals\nof the enlightenment.\n\u201cAre things\ngetting better\nor are we\napproaching a\ndarker period\nof human\nhistory?\u201d\n\u201cProgress\nhas been\nhappening\ncontinuously,\nbut that it is\ncertainly not\ninevitable\u201d\nOne of the four pillars\nPinker mentions stands\nout: progress. In contrast\nto all the others, he points\nout, progress is measurable and the question\nof whether the world is\nseeing progress and is\nbecoming more enlightened can be subjected to\nscientific scrutiny. And\nthis is exactly what fills\nmost of the book: statistic\nafter statistic from all\nsorts of areas from wealth\nand health to death by\npoisoning, one of the very\nfew negative trends he\nmentions. All of them are\nassociated with what most\npeople would call progress\nof some form and are\npresented as the objective\nproof of the effect, which\nthe enlightenment has had\non our lives.\nThe issue is that modern\nintellectuals hate progress,\nPinker thinks, and accuses\nthe pessimistic attitude of\na lot of academics, which\nresonates with the media,\nof leading people to focus\non the negative aspects of\nprogress.\nThe key question, of\ncourse, is whether all this\nis just a feeble attempt to\ndistract us from problematic trends or whether it\nis actually a good ground\nfor optimism. It is neither,\nI would say. Saying that\nPinker turns a blind eye\nto any of the issues the\nworld faces today would\nbe too easy. After all,\nhe does stress the point\nthat progress has been\nhappening continuously,\nbut that it is certainly not\ninevitable. Neither can he\nbe accused of mindless\noptimism; optimism yes,\nbut in no way mindless\nsince he does his best to\nback up his claims with\nempirical evidence.\nWhat he perhaps does\nfall foul of is a guileless projection of what\nhappened in the past onto\nthe future. Events, trends,\nand developments that\nhappened in the past under\ncertain circumstances\nmight not necessarily\nhappen in the same way\nin the future, even if the\ncircumstances remain\nunchanged. In general, his\nargument is surrounded\nby a hands-on buckle-up\n\u201cyes, we can\u201d mentality.\nSure, climate change\nposes a huge challenge,\nbut we can deal with it\nand if we just try, progress\nin all its various manifestations will eventually\nsort it out. His scientism\nand unbeatable faith in\nscience in this sense are\nobvious.\nSo, are Pinker\u2019s\narguments reconcilable\nwith the less optimistic\nworldviews of many other\npublic intellectuals and\nthe increasingly pessimistic feelings of the general\npublic? I think they are.\nObviously, Steven\nPinker does not expect us\nto break down and shed\nhot tears of joy as we\nmarvel at the wonders we\nhumans have created. I\nthink it is about a shift in\nperspective, maybe even\njust a very slight shift.\nAs Pinker argues, there\nis no point in completely\ndisregarding all the\nevidence for positive\nchange. On the other\nhand, it is wrong to think\nthat science and reason\nwill sooner or later solve\nevery problem that\nhumanity has and will\nencounter. What we need\nis to rediscover all the\ngreat things that happened\nas a result of the enlightenment and that is, I think,\nwhat Enlightenment Now\naims to do. It is a gentle\nreminder for people who\nare fed a diet of bad news,\nthat progress is happening\nand that so far, in spite of\nwar, famine, and disease,\nhumanity has managed to\nset up a framework, that\nmakes a better future a\ngenuine possibility.\nThe Enlightenment brought drama to art, as well as the ideas of logic and reason we still live by // Wikimedia\n\n"

Call Me by Your\nName started out in the lead when it picked up the Gotham\nAward back in November, but next month the National\nBoard of Review of Motion Pictures decided to award\ntheir top prize to Steven Spielberg\u2019s The Post. Greta Gerwig\u2019s\nLady Bird and Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside\nEbbing, Missouri then moved to the front of the pack when\nboth picked up Best Film at the Golden Globes, and since\nthen, Three Billboards has gone on to win at the SAG awards\nand the BAFTAs, cementing it as the frontrunner in the race.\nWhile Lady Bird and Get Out remain dark horses in the race,\nI\u2019d say the only film with a realistic chance of dethroning\nThree Billboards is Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s The Shape of Water.\nIt should be an exciting night. Mark Aduol\nWill win: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\nShould win: The Shape of Water\nShoulda been a contender: The Handmaiden\nBest Director\nT\nhis year\u2019s Best Director race has been one of the most\nfiercely competitive in recent memory, yet it appears\nGuillermo del Toro will come out on top for his swirling fantasy romance The Shape of Water. It couldn\u2019t\nhappen to a nicer guy. Del Toro\u2019s direction is superb, yet the\nmost perfect work comes from our current greatest director,\nPaul Thomas Anderson, in his swirlier, more fantastical, and\nmore romantic Phantom Thread. Where Del Toro is inspired,\nAnderson is flawless, and so should come out on top. Alas this\naward will continue to evade him as it did the likes of Kubrick\nand Hitchcock \u2013 there\u2019s no shame in that. The likes of Luca\nGuadagnino, Denis Villeneuve, and Sean Baker can rightly\nfeel aggrieved at being shut out by lesser works by debutants\nGreta Gerwig and Jordan Peele.

There\u2019s a chance,\nhowever, a different mother may win: Laurie Metcalf would\nmake a more-than-worthy winner for her portrayal of Marion\nMcPherson, the emotional centrepiece of Greta Gerwig\u2019s Lady\nBird. What is perhaps most heartening about this category,\nhowever, is how it is celebrating older women who are all\ntoo often written off in the film industry. She may bring the\naverage age down, but it would have been nice to see Michelle\nWilliams on the list, for her Katharine Hepburn-esque turn in\nAll the Money in the World. FF\nWill win: Allison Janney (I, Tonya)\nShould win: Laurie Metcalf (Lady Bird)\nShoulda been a contender: Michelle Willams (All the\nMoney in the World)\nBest Actress\nI\nt is all but guaranteed that Frances McDormand will run\naway with this award for her portrayal of anti-heroine,\nMildred Hayes, in Martin McDonagh\u2019s drama, Three\nBillboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri. Three Billboards\nis told primarily through the eyes of grief-stricken mother\nHayes, who serves as a vessel for McDonagh\u2019s trademark\npotion of caustic wit and darkly comedic dialogue. Some\nhave said that by juxtaposing Mildred\u2019s superficial black\nhumour with the inner turmoil caused by the rape and murder\nof her daughter, McDonagh has crafted a tonally inconsistent\ncharacter. However, one could also argue that the difficulty\nin authentically portraying a character that is simultaneously\nheartbroken, vengeful, compassionate, and humorous is\nreason enough to award McDormand the Oscar. MD\nWill win: Frances McDormand (Three Billboards)\nShould win: Frances McDormand (Three Billboards)\nShoulda been a contender: Vicky Krieps (Phantom Thread)\nBest Actor\nW\nhen people make lists of great actors who have\nnever won an Oscar, Gary Oldman is no doubt\na regular feature. And that is firmly where he\nshould remain. Caked in make-up, Oldman\nbellows his way through Joe Wright\u2019s clunky Darkest Hour\nin a performance a world away from his best. Meanwhile\nDay-Lewis reunites with Paul Thomas Anderson in Phantom\nThread for the final performance of an astonishing career. The\nlast time the two worked together resulted in one of the finest\nperformances ever seen on screen, and once again Day-Lewis\ndelivers the best work of the year. For his last role he wrongly\nbeat out Joaquin Phoenix to claim a record third Best Actor\ntrophy. For his final ever role, he should be allowed to extend\nthat record to four. AL\nWill win: Gary Oldman (Darkest Hour)\nShould win: Daniel Day-Lewis (Phantom Thread)\nShoulda been a contender: James Franco (The Disaster Artist)\nI\nf there\u2019s one injustice we should be upset about in\nthis day and age, it is without a doubt the exclusion of\nMichael Stuhlbarg in the Best Supporting Actor category.\n\u2018For what film?\u2019 I hear you ask \u2013 well this is the question.\nStuhlbarg has been in three of the stand-out films this year,\nand for each he could deserve a nomination; but it was in Call\nMe by Your Name he shone brightest, delivering the most\nmemorable moment of a beautiful film. If there were any justice in the world, he would be nominated, and Willem Dafoe\nwould win for his performance in Sean Baker\u2019s The Florida\nProject. But the world is a cruel place: Woody Harrelson is on\nthe nominations list, Sam Rockwell will take home the statue,\nand there is no God. Fred Fyles\nshould win, and who\u2019ve been left out in the cold\nBest Animated Feature\nI\nt was to be expected that once again the animation\ncategory will be underwhelming and underappreciated.\nWith this year\u2019s controversial rule change, allowing any\nmember with an interest in animation to cast their votes,\nit is worse than ever. On the surface this may seem like a step\nin the right direction, but looking at the nominations this year\nis tragic. Loving Vincent is an amazing feat of animation, and\nCoco is a great movie, tugging at the heartstrings of kids and\nadults alike, but when they are up against John Cena and Boss\nBaby it just feels like the Academy are taking the piss. Now\nmore than ever the Oscars seem out of touch with animation\nand although Coco is a great movie and deserves to win, Boss\nBaby should win just to wake the academy and the film world\nup and completely reform this category. Mikhail Demtchenko\nWill win: Coco\nShould win: Coco\nShoulda been a contender: Okja\nBest Foreign Language Film\nA\nFantastic Woman is A Fantastic Film, with Daniela\nVega spearheading what could be A Fantastic\nBreakthrough for trans cinema. But in this hotly\ncontested category, it is hard to tell who will\nwin. Going up against Palme d\u2019Or winner The Square and\nLoveless, a Cannes jury favourite and bookies\u2019 favourite, the\nOscar could go any way. With 92 films submitted for this category this year, it is interesting to see how different the Oscar\nnominations were to the Baftas and those who didn\u2019t make the\ncut. Most notably missing Angelina Jolie\u2019s First They Killed\nmy Father, Netflix super success Okja, and, more tragically,\nthe absence of Bafta winner The Handmaiden, which made a\nstrong fight for the Palme d\u2019Or and snapped up the coveted\nFelix Film Best Picture award. MD\nWill win: Loveless (Russia)\nShould win: A Fantastic Woman (Chile)\nShoulda been a contender: The Handmaiden (South Korea)\nBest Adapted Screenplay\nW\nhen the nominees were announced back in\nJanuary I wrote that \u201cone could have desperately scribbled down the ingredients from the back\nof a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup on a napkin\nfive minutes before the nominations went out and still been in\nwith a chance of an Adapted Screenplay nod\u201d. I stand by that\nstatement. Call Me by Your Name, from the legendary James\nIvory, is the only truly outstanding work. The Academy would\nhave done well to recognise Sofia Coppola\u2019s steamy femme\nfatale reimagining of Thomas P. Cullinan\u2019s The Beguiled over\nAaron Sorkin\u2019s unnecessarily tell-not-show Molly\u2019s Game\nscript. Sorkin has become the Streep of his craft, rewarded\nover others more deserving based on his reputation. AL\nWill win: Call Me by Your Name\nShould win: Call Me by Your Name\nShoulda been a contender: The Beguiled\nBest Original Screenplay\nW\nhether creating an original screenplay or adapting a pre-existing work for the screen is harder\nremains an open question. What can be said for\ncertain about all the nominees for Best Original\nScreenplay this year, however, is that they have all managed to\ncreate their own sense of time and place. The winner is likely\nto be Martin McDonagh\u2019s Three Billboards Outside Ebbing,\nMissouri \u2013 theAcademy continues their long-running fixation\nwith people saying improbably witty things very quickly. A\nmuch worthier winner would be Greta Gerwig for Lady Bird \u2013\n93 minutes of delicately crafted dialogue that pays homage to\nthe relationship between mothers and daughters. Paul Thomas\nAnderson\u2019s Phantom Thread, with its stomach-turning exploration of power dynamics, is a striking omission. FF\nWill win: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\nShould win: Lady Bird\nShoulda been a contender: Phantom Thread\nBest Original Score\nW\nith the Hans Zimmer votes being split between\nDunkirk and Bladerunner 2049 at the Baftas\nAlexandre Desplat managed to beat out competition to take home the award to put alongside\nhis Golden Globe. This comes at no surprise, with Desplat\u2019s\nromantic fantasy style score perfectly accenting the relationships in the movie. However the Oscars could be a different\nstory: with only one Hans Zimmer film being nominated and\nthe academy primed to throw their votes his direction, he may\nfinally pick up his second oscar. There rest of the nominations\nare not to be trifled with either: with legend John Williams,\nRadiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, and Coen veteran\nCarter Burwell, this certainly is a stacked category. MD\nWill win: Hans Zimmer (Dunkirk)\nShould win: Alexandre Desplat (The Shape of Water)\nShoulda been a contender: Oneohtrix Point Never (Good Time)\nBest Documentary\nL\nastyear\u2019sO.J.:MadeinAmerica,whichwontheOscar\nfor Best Documentary, broke the mould, clocking in\nat over 460 minutes long. In this ceremony, however,\nthings are largely back to normal: five documentaries,\non a wide range of subjects, competing for the crown. Icarus,\na fast-paced doc on the Russian Olympic doping program, is\nlikely to be the winner. Agn\u00e8s Varda and JR\u2019s documentary\nFaces Places would be a more unique winner, and \u2013 given\nit is likely to be Varda\u2019s last film \u2013 a worthier one. Frederick\nWiseman, who was awarded an Honorary Award at last year\u2019s\nceremony, should have garnered a nomination for Ex Libris,\nhis warm-hearted, tender portrayal of the New York Public\nLibrary system, dizzying in scope but intimate in mood. FF\nWill win: Icarus\nShould win: Faces Places\nShoulda been a contender: Ex Libris\n\n"

Examples include\nchanges in sleeping or\neating habits, withdrawal\nfrom social contact and\nactivities, not attending\nlectures or society activities as they normally\nwould, and increased use\nof drugs and alcohol.\nPhysical Changes:\nDo they look different?\nExamples include noticeable weight gain or loss,\nlooking pale or tired or\nnoticeably anxious and\nworried, and sudden\nchanges in personal\nhygiene.\nEmotional Changes:\nHave their moods\nchanged? Examples\ninclude being consistently\nmore tearful, irritable\nor sensitive, and more\nfrequent/severe mood\nswings.\nIntellectual Changes:\nIs what they are saying\nvery different? Examples\ninclude continual\nnegative thinking, such\nas self-deprecating statements or thinking that\nthe worst-case scenario is\nalways going to happen,\ninability to concentrate,\nand difficulty following\nconversations.\nAs well as being able to\nnotice these signs, it\u2019s also\nimportant to have an idea\nof what to do to support\nyour friends. Here\u2019s a\nbrief overview of things\nto remember:\n1. Start the con-versation: One of the\nmost helpful things you\ncan do is ask your friend\nhow they are doing, and\nnot just superficially. If\nyou have noticed any\nof the signs mentioned\nabove, your friend might\nappreciate the opportunity\nto get things off their\nchest. Remember that it\nis usually easier to have\nthese conversations in\nprivate and when you both\nhave enough time to chat.\nThe tone of the conversation is also important:\navoid leading questions\nand don\u2019t probe beyond\nwhat your friend is comfortable with. You don\u2019t\nneed to give advice, as\noften these conversations\nare useful on their own.\n2. Make sure they\u2019re\ntaking care of themselves:\nWhether it\u2019s making sure\nthat they\u2019re having fun\nwith friends, eating right,\nexercising or sleeping\nmore. Ultimately, taking\ncare of your mental\nwellbeing is especially\nimportant when things\nare tough. If your friend\nis dropping the ball on\nthese things, you can text\nreminders or organise\nevents to give them that\nextra nudge.\n3. Take care of\nyourself first: This is by\nfar the most important\npoint. You don\u2019t need\nto be on call 24-hours a\nday, seven days a week.\nHelping a friend with their\nstruggles requires a lot of\nemotional effort, and if\nyou\u2019re burning out its ok\nto take a step back. It\u2019s also\nimportant to remember\nthat you might not be able\nto solve the issues your\nfriend is struggling with,\nand it may get to the point\nwhere professional help is\nneeded. If that\u2019s the case,\nrecognise that what they\nneed is not something that\nyou can give.\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m up\nto at the moment!\nF\nrom Felix articles to Under Pressure\nweek, my term so far has been full to\nthe brim with mental health talks and\ndiscussions. I\u2019m well aware that, as\nthis is the first year my position has existed,\nmost of the things I start are too big for me\nto be able to finish. That said, I\u2019ve managed\nto get bits and bobs done this year.\nFirstly, I\u2019ve been in discussions with the\nUnion Shop about stocking wellbeing\nrelated items. So far, they have agreed to\nstock fidget cubes (with a little description\nfrom me about why they\u2019re useful) and will\nreview stocking other items suggested by\nme depending on how they sell.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ve been working very\nhard to put wellbeing and liberation on\nthe map at Union Council. I\u2019ve passed a\npaper regarding guidelines to make Union\nactivities more accessible to people with\ndyslexia, dyspraxia, ADHD, and autism, and\nregularly advocated for a meeting room that\nis fully wheelchair accessible (which, so far,\nit has not been). I\u2019ve also seconded papers\non the creation of a liberation officer to\nrepresent those from poorer backgrounds,\nnow subject to a consultation (please take\npart!) and the creation of an official petitions\nsystem which is now underway. I\u2019ve also\nattended meetings of the Community\nand Welfare Board (essentially the welfare\nsubcommittee of council) and met with\nmembers of college staff to discuss\neverything from having better counselling\nprovision on non-SK campuses (including\nWhite City) to putting mental health before\nacademic attainment.\nHowever, my position\u2019s time to shine will\nbe during exams next term when I will be\ndoing work with a college-wide campaign\ncentred around the topics covered in my\narticle. Mentality will also have a role in the\ncampaign, so keep an eye out for it!\nAriana SadrHashemi\nMental Health Liberation\nOfficer\nLIBERATION\nChecking in on your friends is vital // CC\n\n"

UCL\u2019s\nrapid expansion has\ncome under fire recently,\nafter academics backed\na motion of no confidence in the university\u2019s\nleadership. One of the\nUK\u2019s leading judges said\nUCL management was\n\u201cintent on driving through\na programme of rapid\nexpansion\u2026 exposing it\nto serious financial and\nacademic risks\u201d.\nWhen asked how the\nCollege would ensure\ncurrent levels of growth\nare sustainable, a spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a\nbalanced and sustainable\nstrategy for expansion. We\nare building a mixture of\ninvestment assets which\nwill provide income in the\nfuture as well as academic\nfacilities which will allow\nus to deliver our core\nmission.\u201d Last year the\nCollege invested roughly\n\u00a3200 million in its estate,\nincluding projects in\nSouth Kensington and\nWhite City.\nImperial Accommodation\nImperial has also been\nrapidly expanding the\namount of student accommodation it owns, increasing bedspaces by nearly\na fifth over the past five\nyears. The College owns\nmore than 3,500 bedspac-es \u2013 more than LSE and\nQMUL, but fewer than\nUCL or KCL. Space for\nundergraduate students,\nhowever, remains tight: in\nlast year\u2019s annual report,\nthe College reported its\ngrowth in enrolments was\n\u201cweighted towards postgraduates to avoid putting\nstrain on our commitment\nto provide all first-year\nundergraduates with a\nroom in halls\u201d.\nWhile the College\npromises to provide all\nfirst-year undergraduates\nwith accommodation,\nits current holdings do\nnot allow it to do so: this\nacademic year, Imperial\naccepted 2,715 students,\nbut currently only owns\n2,484 bedspaces, not including those in GradPad.\nAs a result, Imperial\noffers students spaces at\nhalls which are not owned\nand/or operated by the\nCollege, such as Xenia,\nwhich provides space for\nnearly 150 students and is\noperated by the Salvation\nArmy Housing Association (SAHA).\nOne way Imperial will\nbe trying to make up the\nshortfall is with new accommodation outside of\ncentral London. In 2015 it\nopened Woodward Buildings, a 19-storey building\nin North Acton with space\nfor 690 students. Last year\nit acquired another plot of\nland in Acton, which will\nbe used to expand the\nstudent accommodation\non offer to around 1,300\nbedspaces. The College\nsays this will be done to\nensure it has \u201cthe critical\nmass needed to develop a\nvibrant student hub\u201d. The\nnew hall will form part\nof the undergraduate first\nto the South Kensington\ncampus: an en-suite room\nat Woodward Buildings\ncosts \u00a3131 per week,\ncompared to \u00a3232 for a\nroom in Eastside Halls.\nConstruction of\nWoodward Buildings has\nallowed Imperial to keep\nits average rent increase\nyear-on-year to around\n2.5%, slightly above the\naverage inflation rate for\nthe period: in 2012, the\naverage room in Imperial-owned undergraduate\naccommodation was\n\u00a3155/week, compared to\naround \u00a3175/week this\nyear.\nThe year Woodward\nBuildings opened saw a\nsharp increase in rent for\ncentral student accommo-dation, following lobbying by Imperial College\nUnion (ICU) to restructure\npricing of halls. Between\nSeptember 2014 and September 2015, the average\nrent in central London\nhalls owned by Imperial \u2013\nincluding Eastside, Southside, Wilson House, and\nPembridge \u2013 increased by\nnearly \u00a330, from \u00a3166/\nweek to \u00a3193/week. At\nthe time, Tom Wheeler,\nthen Union President,\nsaid: \u201cIt is fantastic that\nas a result of our lobbying\nwe have secured lower\nrent for over 1,000 future\nstudents.\u201d\nAccording to data\nrental income of \u00a3720,000\neach week \u2013 more than\nany other London university bar KCL, which\nowns around 40% more\nbedspaces than Imperial.\nIn a statement for Felix,\na College representative\nsaid Imperial did not\nprofit from student rents:\n\u201cThe College\u2019s approach\nto pricing is to ensure\nrental income covers the\ncollege\u2019s maintenance,\ncapital and running costs\nfor accommodation,\nbut does not generate\na surplus from student\nrents. Student rents are set\nevery five years and the\nCollege will consult with\nthe Union in the same way\nwhen it comes to setting\nrents for the next five year\nperiod.\u201d\nAt the beginning of\nthis academic year, it\nwas revealed Woodward\nBuildings had failed fire\nsafety tests carried out on\nits cladding in the wake of\nthe tragic Grenfell Tower\nfire. While having sections\nof cladding that failed\ngovernment-ordered tests,\nWoodward Buildings\nwere confirmed \u201csafe for\noccupancy\u201d by fire safety\nteams. A review of the\nrest of Imperial\u2019s halls\nfound none used unsafe\ncladding. Woodward\nBuildings is still awaiting\nnew cladding.\nImperial and GradPad\nPostgraduate accommodation has also been an\narea in which Imperial has\nrealised a profit over the\npast few years. Imperial\nowns accommodation for\nover 1,000 postgraduate\nstudents across two\nblocks marketed under the\nbrand \u201cGradPad\u201d, which\ndescribes itself as \u201cLondon\u2019s premier provider\nof postgraduate student\naccommodation\u201d.\nThe two complexes \u2013 Griffon Studios in\nBattersea, and Wood Lane\nStudios on the North Site\nWoodward Buildings continues to have cladding that has failed fire safety tests // Imperial\n\"Imperial has\nincreased rent\nover the last\nfew years, with\nthe average\nnow standing\nat \u00a3175/week\u201d\n\u201cWoodward\nstill has not\nhad its unsafe\ncladding,\nwhich was\ndiscovered\nin August,\nreplaced\u201d\nprovided by the College,\nif all College-owned\nbedspaces were rented\nout, it would generate a\nluxury postgraduate accommodation owned by College\nof Imperial\u2019s White City\ncampus \u2013 are owned by\nImperial, but operated by\nUPP, which manages over\n32,000 rooms in the UK.\nPrices at GradPad start\nat \u00a3219/week, but go up\nto \u00a3430/week; all contracts are for 51 weeks.\nIf all rooms available\nin GradPad were rented\nout this academic year,\nit would produce nearly\n\u00a3300,000 in rental income\neach week \u2013 over 40% of\nall potential income from\nstudent rents.\nThe most expensive\nrooms at GradPad, which\ncan be found in the Wood\nLane complex, are among\nthe most expensive of all\nuniversity-owned accommodation \u2013 50% more\nexpensive than UCL\u2019s\nmost expensive offering.\nFelix spoke to one\npostgraduate student, who\nlived in GradPad\u2019s Battersea property last academic\nyear, who said they had \u201ca\ngood experience overall\u201d.\nThey highlighted features\nlike the gym, the con-venience, and \u201cthe desk\nstaff were really nice and\nhelpful\u201d. \u201cI think Imperial is very\npro-pushing people to\nuse GradPad. If you go\nonto the website there\u2019s\nno advice for PG accom-modation, or find-a-friend\nwebsite; you have to show\nyour own initiative to not\nend up going there. I had\nGradPad pushed on me\u201d.\nThey also said they\nfelt international students\nwere more likely to\nfeel compelled to use\nGradPad: \u201cA lot of people\nwho stay there are inter-national, and I think they\nget screwed over. The\nway [Imperial] targets it is\nvery much \u2018this is the simplest solution, you won\u2019t\nhave to worry about it\u2019,\nand I think that appeals to\npeople who are travelling\noverseas, who can\u2019t see\nthe properties.\u201d\nThese concerns were\nechoed by a number of\npostgraduate students\nFelix spoke to. One\nstudent approaching the\nend of their PhD at Imperial after moving from UCL\nsaid it wasn\u2019t an isolated\nproblem: \u201cNeither UCL\nnor Imperial were any\nhelp finding accommoda-tion, at least not in a proactive way. I tried looking\nat the Imperial accredited\nprivate accommodation\npage, but the options were\nscarce and expensive.\u201d\nAnother student, who\ncompleted their PhD at the\nend of the past academic\nyear, told Felix that while\nGradPad had \u201cvery nice\nfacilities\u201d and \u201cwas worth\nit if you could afford it\u201d,\nit was not an option for\nthose on the minimum\nstipend.\n\u201cThey market it at\neveryone, including those\nwho may not realise they\ncan\u2019t afford it, and they\ndon\u2019t give any alternatives\nfor people who have to\nlook elsewhere. Some\nmake the assumption they\ncan afford it, because you\nshould be able to afford\nwhat Imperial recom-mends, even if you\u2019re on\nthe minimum stipend.\n\u201cWhile I don\u2019t have\nany problems with\nGradPad itself \u2013 I don\u2019t\nthink it's unfairly priced\nconsidering the benefits,\nand compared to similar\nhalls aimed at young professionals \u2013 I take issue\nwith the fact there\u2019s no\nalternative or support for\nmost students who will\nnot be able to afford it.\nImperial should do more\nto ensure the marketing\nthat gets to students provides options for students\nof all background to allow\nthem to live comfortably\nand safely, instead of just\npassing on information\nrelevant to the wealthiest\nsubset and leaving the rest\nto figure it out.\u201d\nThe only option for\npostgraduate students Imperial currently lists on its\naccommodation webpage\nfor those outside Silwood\nPark is GradPad. While\nit does have a private\naccommodation guide,\nand puts on events aimed\nat helping people find\nprivate accommodation,\nthere is no information\nspecific to postgraduate\nstudents.\nIn a statement, a\nCollege spokesperson\nsaid: \u201cAll students have\nImperial is rapidly expanding into the White City area // Imperial\n\u201cImperial has\nbeen accused\nof aggressively\nmarketing\nGradPad, its\nluxury PG\nstudios\u201d\nHowever, they also\npointed out: \u201cOne thing\nthat annoyed me the most\nwas there\u2019s no oven in\nthe accommodation. You\nhave hob space, but it gets\nto a point where you\u2019re\nlike \u2018oh god, why do I not\nhave an oven?\u2019 That was\nreally frustrating.\u201d Having\nindividual kitchens meant\n\u201cit was quite an antisocial\nenvironment\u201d, with \u201cno\nencouragement of social\ninteraction\u201d.\nThey highlighted how\nmuch Imperial had promoted GradPad before\nthey started their course: GradPad studios go for up to \u00a3430/week // Imperial\naccess to Imperial Home\nSolutions, an online\nwebsite managed by the\nStudent Hub promoting\nprivate landlords as well\nas other purpose built\nstudent halls. We do send\ninformation on GradPad\nto students when they\naccept their place as it\ncan be a more convenient option for overseas\npostgraduate students as\nit can be organised before\nthey arrive in the UK - but\npostgraduate students are\ninformed via the website\nabout the options in the\nprivate rental sector as\nwell.\u201d\nAs well as GradPad,\nImperial previously had\nholdings in other postgraduate accommodation.\nLast year it sold a block\nof postgraduate accommodation to another\nprovider, which has since\nmarketed it to undergrad-uates; having acquired the\nproperty in 2012, Imperial\nmade a total profit of \u00a39.2\nmillion.\nyear guarantee portfolio.\nIt is unclear whether or\nnot the accommodation to\nbe constructed will be as\naffordable as that on offer\nat Woodward Buildings,\nwhich is currently subsi-dised compared to similar\naccommodation nearby.\nThe accommodation\navailable at Woodward is\nsignificantly cheaper than\nrooms available closer\nCont\n\n"

From generating new skin for burn\nvictims, to creating new\norgans in the lab, these\ncells undoubtedly have\nthe potential to improve\nour quality of life.\nNevertheless, these\nhighly unspecialised\npluripotent embryonic\nstem cells (ESC) only\nreside in rare places\nwithin the body, including\ndeveloping embryos. As\nthey are obtained from\nembryos, this has raised a\nnumber of ethical issues.\nThereby, a new method of\nreprogramming specialised adult cells has been\ndeveloped: induced pluri-potent stem cells (iPSC).\nImagine an egg. It has\nthe potential to become\na lot of things if you add\nthe right ingredients. For\ninstance, you can make\na delicious Victorian\nsponge, or you can make\na piping hot omelette.\nThe Nobel-prize-worthy\nquestion is: can you turn\nthe final product back to\nits original ingredient?\nPut the egg back into its\nshell?\nThis answer is yes!\niPSCs are essentially the\nsuccessfully developed\nthis reprogramming\ntechnology back in 2006.\nHowever, this process\nis extremely difficult,\nand the efficiency of the\nreprogramming process is\nless than 1%. To put this\ninto context, according\nto Amram Shapiro\u2019s\nbook The Book of Odds,\nthere is a higher chance\nof getting into Harvard\nthan successfully turning\na specialised cell into an\niPSC.\nSuch low efficiency\nhinders the transferal\nof this technology into\nthe clinic, so constant\nefforts are being made\nto improve the process.\nRecently, a group led\nby Ganna Bilousova,\nPh.D. in the University\nof Colorado Anschutz\nMedical Campus, US, has\nuncovered a more efficient\nway to create iPSCs from\nskin cells.\nBy introducing a\ncocktail of molecules that\ncontrol how genes turn\non and off (modified nu-cleobases, supplemented\nwith ESC-specific mature\nmicro-RNA mimics), the\ngroup has successfully\nenhanced the efficiency\nof the reprogramming\nprocess.\nNot only did they create\nthis unique mixture of\nmolecules, but they also\noptimised the way these\nmolecules are introduced\ninto the skin cells. This\nmeans that the adult cells\nare more receptive to the\nchanges, and less likely\nto die from the reprogramming process. Additionally, the cell growing\nregime was fine-tuned\nby having a low plating\ndensity, thus cells are less\ncrowded and grow faster.\nThese changes allow a\nmaximum efficiency for\nturning skin cells into\niPSCs.\nBy augmenting both\nthe culturing conditions\nand the level of reprogramming molecules,\nthese modifications acted\nsynergistically to improve\nthe process. Upon inspec-tion, the results of the\ngene expression profile\nhinted that other players,\nsuch as SLLA4, may be\nmediating the process of\nreprogramming.\nAltogether, this allows\nan ultra-high efficient\nsystem where both\ndiseased and healthy skin\ncells can be turned into\niPSCs in a cheaper, faster,\nand more reliable manner.\nNonetheless, this protocol\nis cell-type specific,\nmeaning more work is\nneeded if we want to\nuse this technique in the\nclinic or for treating other\ndiseases. So keep eating\nyour greens and head to\nthe gym \u2013 growing organs\nin the lab is not quite here\nyet!\nUnderstanding apoptosis: the human suicide squad\nA\nre you aware\nthat human\ncells also\nhave their\nown version of a suicide\nsquad? This squad comes\ninto action in times of\nextreme distress, when\ncells have extinguished\nall other means to combat\ntheir stress. Their call to\naction means only one\nthing \u2013 destruction of\nthe cells themselves, and\neverything inside which\ncan also pose a threat to\nthe rest of the body. While\nyou may consider this ultimate act of self-sacrifice\ntoo extreme, this suicidal\ndeath of a cell, also termed\n\u2018Apoptosis\u2019, is used to\nkeep life-threatening\ndangers such as cancer in\ncheck.\nThe latest findings\npublished last week\nexplained one of the less\nunderstood steps of the\nprocess of apoptosis: the\nmechanism of the release\nof the mitochondrial (MT)\ngenome inside the cell\u2019s\ncytoplasm. The integrity\nof mitochondria serves as\na checkpoint for the cell to\ndecide if the circumstances are severe enough to\nactivate self-detonation. and cause the release of\nmitochondrial DNA into\nthe cytoplasm, which\nfurther signals the continuation of apoptosis in the\ncell. This latest study \u2013\npublishedbyajointcollab-oration between Monash\nUniversity, Walter and\nEliza Hall Institute, and\nHoward Hughes Medical\nInstitute \u2013 was able to\nrecord the expulsion of\nthe mitochondrial genome\nin real time. They used a\ncombination of multiple\nmicroscopy techniques\nto image cells at a very\nhigh degree of resolution.\nTheir images confirmed\nthat BAK/BAX proteins\ncreate large pores inside\nthe outer membrane of the\nmitochondria. The inner\nMT membrane pushes\nout through these holes\nto escape into cytoplasm\nwith all of its constituents.\nThis mechanism of action\nis also called \u201cmitochondrial hernia\u201d.\nThe primary technology which could make\nthis possible was lattice\nlight sheet microscopy.\nThis was developed by\nEric Betzig, winner of\nthe 2014 Nobel Prize in\nChemistry. This technique improves the older\nlight sheet fluorescence\nmicroscopy by increasing\nimage acquisition speed\nand reducing phototoxici-ty induced damage to the\ncells. According to Betzig\nhimself, this technology\nwill have more impact\nthan his Nobel-winning\nwork on super-resolution\nmicroscopy.\nBoth the results and\nmethod of study will\nimpact future work. This\nstrategy of using multiple\nmicroscopy techniques to\ncapture cellular activities\ninside the living cells at\nsuch high resolution will\nimprove our understanding of internal function-ing. Hopefully, these\nadvances will culminate\nin practical applications\nin fields of health and\nmedicine.\nSCIENCE\nSarah Wong\nScience Writer\nSCIENCE\nVarshit Dusad\nScience Writer\nStem cells can provide incredibly opportunities for medicine // Wikimedia\n\u201cFrom new\norgans to\nregenerating\nskin, stem\ncells can\nundoubtingly\nimprove our\nquality of life\u201d\nproduct of reverting the\ncake or an omelette back\ninto its raw, untouched\nform; a Japanese scien-tist, Shinya Yamanaka,\n\u201cApoptosis\nis used to\nkeep life-threatening\ndangers such\nas cancer in\ncheck\u201d\nIt is well known that two\nproteins \u2013 BAK and BAX\n\u2013 play an important role\nin this programmed cell\ndeath.

This was a very\nhumbling experience\nand one that I will never\nforget! Recently a portion of the news really\ncaught my attention \u2013\nfor the wrong reasons,\nhowever. They reported\non a study which found\nthat between 1999 and\n2015, a period of just\n16 years, the population\nof Bornean orangutans\nhad dropped by over\nhalf. This figure may not\nsound that alarming, but\nthis enigmatic decline\nhas a very sinister cause:\nthe exploitation of the\nnatural world to supply\nthe developed world with\ncheap goods such as palm\noil. The biggest contributions to the murder\nof orangutans include\nhunting and the logging\nlost in the period being\nstudied \u2013 an average of 17\nanimals a day. To put this\ninto perspective, it would\nsimilar to losing the entire\npopulation of Lincoln in\nthe same amount of time.\nOnly around half of\nBorneo\u2019s original forest\ncover remains, constricting wildlife to smaller\nand tighter patches of\nsuitable habitat. Where\nthe forest stops, the\nplantations begin. This in\nturn is another cause of\nconflict as orangutans are\noften shot when they enter\nfruit and crop plantations,\nwhere they are seen as\na major raiding pest.\nDeclines such as these\nare unprecedented in a\nnatural system without\nanthropogenic pressures,\nand it will take some\ntime for the orangutans\nto recover if a suitable\nrecovery programme can\nbe established. Like us,\nthey are slow to mature,\nalthough they are not as\nsocial as other great apes\nsuch as chimpanzees. If\nthe current loss of the\nforest and orangutans\ncontinues then there is a\nvery real likelihood that\nthey will be extinct within\nour lifetimes.\nOrangutans share approximately 97% of their\nDNA with us, and their\nname literally translates\ninto the \u201cman of the\nforest\u201d in Malay. They are\nsimilar to us in so many\nways but are also unique\nin their own right too.\nThis raises the question:\nwhy do we not show more\ncompassion for these\nawe-inspiring beings?\nCollaboration, outreach,\nand education are the only\nconceivable solutions\nwe have for conserving\nthese magnificent beings\nfor future generations to\nmarvel at. Moving away\nfrom using products that\ncontain palm oil is just\none of the ways that you\ncan help to reduce your\nimpact on orangutans.\nOrangutans are currently under threat // Wikimedia\n\u201cThe biggest\ncontributions\nto the murder\nof orangutans\ninclude\nhunting and\nthe logging of\ntrees for cash\ncrops\u201d\nof trees in order to grow\nthese cash crops.

With\nincreasingly captivating\nonline entertainment\nfacilities, high calorie\nfood, and a huge swell of\nprocrastination, the 21st\nCentury has vastly altered\nthe human health para-digm. This environment\nis the perfect breeding\nground for diabetes to\ndevelop.\nDiagnosis of diabetes\nhas more than doubled\nsince 1996. Type I\ndiabetes is caused from a\ntotal lack of pancreatic-in-sulin production, while\ntype II diabetes stems\nfrom decreased insulin\nproduction or insulin\ninsensitivity in other cells.\nInsulin is responsible for\nsignalling glucose uptake\nfrom the bloodstream and\nstoring it as glycogen.\nDysregulation of insulin\nproduction leads to\ndisrupted blood-glucose\ncontrol as glucose remains\nin circulation, unable\nto enter the cells and\nleading to a whole host of\nproblems, such as inflam-mation. Historically the\ndisease has always been\nthought of as chronic, pro-gressive, and irreversible.\nHowever, the promise of\na cure for type II diabetes\nseems tantalisingly close\nat hand.\nBiliopancreatic diversion has been a common\nsurgical treatment for\nobesity since the 1920s.\nblood. However, it is only\nrecently that its impact\non reducing diabetes has\nbeen noted. Amazingly,\nclinical trials conducted\non hundreds of patients\nin the last few decades\nreveal that GI surgery is\nthe most effective method\nof combating diabetes:\nProfessor Francesco\nRubino and colleagues at\nKing\u2019s College London\nreported 89% of treated\npeople where managing\nthe disease through diet\nand exercise alone \u2013\nwithout the need for any\nfurther therapy!\nThese incredible results\nhave been narrowed down\nto five phenomena:\n1. Hunger-inducing hormones, such\nas Ghrelin, which are\nprimarily produced in\nthe GI tract, are unable to\nexert an effect to the same\ndegree due to reduced\nconcentrations.\n2. Surgery raises\ncirculating bile acid con-centrations, which helps to\nincrease the breakdown of\nlipids and glucose in cells\nand thus dampen down\nprolonged blood-glucose\nspikes.\n3. The microbiome\n(the population of microorganisms that live in\nyour gut) is also affected,\nreducing inflammation\nand increasing insulin\nsensitivity.\n4. Increased sensitivity of the mechanism\nby which the gut detects\nchanges in glucose concentrations and relays information to the brain for\nthe suppression of glucose\nproduction in the liver\nallows the vagus nerve\nto stop gluconeogenesis\nearlier.\n5. Finally, glucose\ntransporters in the intestinal lining are responsible\nfor glucose uptake having\ndecreased activity. These\ntransporters require\nsodium to transport\nglucose into the cell.\nSurgery bypasses the\nprimary sodium sources in\nthe digestive system (e.g.\nfrom pancreatic juices) resulting in lowered glucose\nuptake.\nFurther research is\nunderway to identify if\nother mechanisms remain\nhidden away, although\nthe effectiveness of the\ntreatment has already\nbeen noticed. In 2016, 45\nmedical societies enlisted\nGI surgery as the standard\ndiabetic treatment, laying\nthe groundwork for\ncrucial steps forward in\nopposing type II diabetes\nand obesity.\n\u201cThe science\nis simple \u2013by\nreorganising\nthe digestive\nsystem to\nshorten the\nGI tract, fewer\nnutrients will\nbe absorbed\u201d\nThe science is simple \u2013 by\nreorganising the digestive\nsystem to shorten the\nroute food takes through\nthe gastrointestinal (GI)\ntract, fewer nutrients\nwill be absorbed by the\n\n"
