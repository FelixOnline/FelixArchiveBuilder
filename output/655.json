    "content": "CAKEERSMuW^mm^km am mk^ mK^m THE CAREERS ADVISORY SERVICE\nA wide range of services are available to undergraduate\nand postgraduate students of the College and to those who\nhave graduated from IC through the Careers Advisory\nService. Careers Advisers are able to give advice at several\nstages. These include an analysis of your aptitude for various\noccupations; the search for information about specific\ncareers or suitable employers, job applications and selection\ninterviews and the pros and cons of offers of employment or\npostgraduate study.\nInformation is available in the\nCareers Library (Rooms 310 and\n311 Sherfield) about a wide range\nof careers. This includes Information Booklets on 70 career areas\nand details of the membership\nrequirements of professional\nbodies, prospectuses of postgraduate courses and reference\nbooks on a wide range of\nsubjects. Local lists of graduate\nemployers are available for those\nwishing to work in specific areas\nof the country.\nA considerable quantity of\ninformation is readily available\non a large number of employers\nwhich usually includes their\nannual report and graduate recruitment literature. Copies of\nthe directories of employers:\nRegister of Graduate Employment and Training (ROGET),\nGraduate Employment and\nTraining (GET), Graduate Opportunities (GO) and Directory\nof Opportunities for Graduates\n(DOG) are freely available on a 'take away' basis.\nEmployers send us details of\nthe vacancies they expect to have\nand these can be seen in a document called 'Forward\nVacancies', in our 'Employers'\nRequirements' files and computer print-out in which they are\nanalysed by degree discipline,\ntype of work and employer.\nThe Careers Advisory Service\narranges or participates in many\nevents at which students and\nemployers can meet. The 'Grad-u ate Recruitment Programme' is\nperhaps the most important of\nthese when around 250 industrial\nand commercial employers and\nsome parts of the scientific civil\nservice visit the College to\nconduct selection interviews.\nFifty .of these employers give\nevening presentations at 6:00pm at which they indicate the opportunities they are offering and\ndiscuss matters informally over a beer. Some employers are invited\nto take part in our series of lunchtime careers talks. This year talks\nrelevant to particular courses are\nbeing held in departments at\n1:30pm on Thursdays and those\nof more general interest at the\nsame time on Tuesdays.\nWe strongly recommend final\nyear students to attend the\ncareers evenings organised by the\nOld Boys' Association. Many IC\ngraduates with a few years'\nexperience in a wide variety of\ncareers attend these functions\nand they present a unique opportunity to discuss career areas with\npeople engaged in those activities\nthemselves.\nThis year we are holding the\nsecond Careers Information Fair\norganised jointly by the Industrial Society and the Careers\nAdvisory Service. Some 60 employers will be present and again\nthe opportunity to talk to a large\nvariety of employers should not\nbe missed.\nFor those who leave job\nseeking until after finals there are\na range of facilities to assist their\njob search. Employers visit the\nUniversity again in June for the\nSummer Fair at which they aim\nto. fill some of their remaining\nvacancies. Lists of job vacancies\nare published in 'Current Vacancies' and 'Job Opportunities\nBulletin'. Vacancies notified direct to the College are displayed\nin the Careers Advisory Service\nand on relevant departmental\nnoticeboards.\nOn Wednesday afternoons a series of in-depth two and a half\nhour workshops are held on\nCareer Choice and the graduate\njob market, job applications and\nselection interview techniques.\nStudents who experience difficulty in these areas can benefit a great deal from these.\nIf indecision persists College\ncareers advisers have a range of\nquestionnaires which can be\nuseful. Commerical vocational\nguidance consultants nearly\nalways start off the process with\nthese and finish by directing you\nto a specific job function. We, on\nthe other hand, tend to use them\nonly when there is need and our\njudgement indicates that they will\nbe of value. They range from\ncomputer aptitude tests to interest guides and a computer\nassisted job matching process\ncalled Gradscope. The results of\nthese may not be spectacularly\nsignificant but an analysis i factors which lead\nextremely valuable.\nto them is\nVacation Work\nThe Careers Advisory Service\nalso tries to assist those of you\ninterested in undertaking va car tion work relevant to your\ndegree. This is done through the\n. Vacation Training Scheme and a pamphlet outlining the scheme is\navailable. Each year we write to a large number of companies who\nsend us details of the kind of\nsummer employment they can\noffer. The Vacation Training\nRepresentatives in your department will be pleased to tell you\nmore. If you cannot locate him or\nher please contact the Careers\nOffice, Rom 309, Sherfield Building. Vacation jobs abroad are\nalso on offer through a related\nscheme called the International\nAssociation for the Exchange of\nStudents for Technical Experience (IAESTE). These are quite\ncompetitive to obtain\u2014just 22\nvacancies last year\u2014and they are\nnot all in the USA or Europe.\nLast summer students visited\nLibya, South Africa, Australia,\nJapan and a wide range of other\ncountries under the auspices of\nIAESTE.\nDr Neil Harris\nPage SI\nTH \u20ac R \u00a3 a* EW \u00a3 Dr \u00ab SDS Ya FT e*M00 hf WORKSHOPS OK TO& APP Ul caT i Or AS a \u00abPINT if c YaY JSF Otf.

Support is\nThe Group and admission is\n\u00a32.50.\nThe industrial sound recently associated with music\nfrom the north of England is gradually disappearing^ many of the serious young men who created it move on to pastures new. New Order have discovered extended\ndisco mixes and chart hits, Echo& the Bunneymen,\nStratford-upon-Avon, the Albert Hall and TO TP and now the Comsat Angels have been converted (or\ncoerced) to the religion of pure pop.\nComing from Sheffield they are keenly aware of its\npossibilities following the success of close neighbours\nthe Human League and ABC. Mind it hasn't always\nbeen like that.\nTheir first album WAITING FOR A MIRACLE was a spartan ly produced and bleak if strangely satisfying\neffort, although never essential like several of its\ncontemporaries. However memorable tracks included\nopener Missing In Action, an uptempo number\ndominated by siren guitar playing and the 'lost in blast\nattack' refrain and Independence Day.\nFollow-up SLEEP NO MORE suffered what now\nwould be called delusions of Bunneymen-syndrome. All\nvery serious, the consistent first side contained some\nfine songs, notably Eye Dance and Dark Parade but the\nsecond side descended into a morass of drum heavy\nsongs.\nThird album FICTION was a critical success and the\nlive shows at the time received similar acclaim.\nHowever lack of success caused Polydor to drop the\nband so they joined CBS subsidiary Jive\u2014primarily a dance orientated label\u2014and trusted the production of\ntheir fourth album LAND to Mike Howlett (responsible\nfor the chart success China Crisis, OM D and Flock of\nSeagulls).\nAgain the album vacillated between good and bad.\nIronically the new producer seemed to wake up the\nband on several tracks\u2014Will You Stay Tonight and\nAlicia (Can you hear me) are positively uplifted by the\ncleaner more professional production and the drums\nbite whereas before they only sounded. Independence\nDay from the first album is re-recorded for this album\nand it is indic it ive of the songs quality that it sounds\ngood under both regimes. Likewise A World Away\nwould be a terrible song performed in any style whilst\nNature Trails and / Know That Feeling are typical, of\nHowlett's worst: raindrop keyboards, gently rippling\nrhythms and abysmal lyrics.\nA notable change of direction is Mister Memory a vicious chunk of thunder-funk and new single Island\nHeart which is reminiscent of Teardrop Explodes at\ntheir best. Elsewhere the shadow of the Human League\n(Phil Oakey's vocals in particular) is apparent but how\nall of this\u2014past punks experimenting with pop. sensibilities\u2014will transfer to the live stage is not so\nobvious.\nPeter Rodgers\n\n"

    "content": "CAREERS \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\nFURTHER EDUCATION\nIS IT REALLY THE THING FOR YOU?\nOver recent years the number of graduates applying for\npostgraduate courses has continued to rise. It would be nice\nto think this is due to better teaching and greater interest at\nundergraduate level. The realistic view must be, that with\njobs for graduates becoming harder to obtain many people\nare turning to postgraduate study as an alternative. With\ntypical government logic, as the demand for places increases,\nso the number of financially supported places decreases.\nGone are the days when a2( i) was the passport to post-graduation acceptance.\nThere are three main options\nopen to graduates seeking postgraduate education. A PhD\nentails three years of original\nresearch which is written up as a thesis and presented to a panel of\nexternal examiners. A number of\ndepartments also insist on the\nattendance at a number of\nlectures a year, some make the\npassing of exams at the end of the\nfirst year a requirement for\ncontinuing further.\nThe MSc is a one year course,\nusually a mixture of lectures,\nexams and a project of about\nthree months duration.\nFor those wishing to go into\nteaching there is the Postgraduate Certificate of Education\n(PGCE). This is a one year course\ncombining lectures, exams,\nessays and fieldwork in the\nclassroom.\nThese then are the options,\nwhy do people apply for them?\ni) An interest in a certain\naspect of their undergraduate\neducation has stimulated a desire to investigate the subject\nfurther.\nii) To pursue a certain\ncareer further qualifications\nare necessary (particularly for\nteaching).\nHi) As an alternative to joining the job hunt or to cover a period of indecision.\nThe best and most successful\npostgraduate candidate will be\nmotivated by a mix of reasons\none and two. A postgraduate\ndegree doesn't guarantee jobs\n(10% of last year's PGCE students are still unemployed). To\nstudy a subject because \"1 enjoy\nit\", still leaves a problem with\nwhat to do when you finish and\nthose who do postgraduate study\nas an easy option are invariably\ndoomed to fail. Don't be mis-taken, postgraduate work isn't easy. It often involves long hours,\nworking weekends and the basic\nfinancial reward is poor. The\ngrant for a single postgraduate in\nLondon is \u00a32,995 for a50 week\nyear.\nSupposing you're still interested how do you go about\ngetting a place? For MSC and\nPGCE courses, apply directly to\nthe college or department that\noffers the course you wish to\nfollow. They may well accept you\nbut won't gur an tee financial\nsupport, a very important con-side ration!! For a PhD there are\ntwo options. One is to write to a department that is currently\nworking on your field of interest\nand see if they have money\navailable for a postgraduate\nstudent. The alternative is to wait\nuntil March/April when the\ngrant awarding bodies produce\ntheir grant awards for the coming\nyear, and then write to the\ndepartments/supervisors receiving them. A word of warning, do\nnot rely on the promise of getting\nmoney at a later date. Invariably\nthe 'promised' money won't materialise and you'll be left with\nan un financed place and it being\ntoo late to apply elsewhere (per-son al experience).\nIn January I intend to run an\ninformal meeting/seminar, for\nall final year undergraduates\ninterested in postgraduate study,\nso your questions can be\nanswered by people who have\nbeen through, are in, or supervise\npostgraduate work. If before\nthen, you require any\ninformation or advice please do\nnot hesitate to contact me via the\nUnion Office.\nChris Hendy\nPG Affairs Officer\nWould anyone interested in committee work for Industrial\nSociety and/or in helping in preparations for the Careers Fair\n(2 Nov), please attend a meeting in Chem Eng LT4 at 12:45\ntoday Friday 28 October.

    "content": "CAREER DECISIONS\nCareer decisions are not the easiest we have to make. Some\nwould have you believe that making a career choice is simply\na matter of facts and figures. Students of science and\nengineering\u2014so the sena rio goes\u2014 need only the names and\naddresses of suitable employers plus other suitable information and a career will automatically follow.\nOthers find career decisions hard because they have\ndifficulty in visual ising what life outside education can be\nlike and hesitate to take this 'jump into the dark'.\nAll of these are, in my view,\nmisconceptions. It is worth remembering what the important\nfactors in your last major career\ndecision were\u2014the move from\nschool to university. Some may\nhave been facts to do with the A Level grades required, the size of\nthe department or the content of\nthe course. Others will have been\nfeelings including considerable\ninterest in certain subjects and a satisfaction gained from studying\nthem. Being more at home in\ncertain environments than other:\ncity versus green field universities\nmay have been significant, or\nsheer prejudice that certain\ncourses are unsuitable based on\nhearsay rather than evidence.\nChoosing a career after graduation is not so different but by\nthen you have had more experience to help you in making your\ndecisions. Some of the subjects\nstudied within your degree course\nmay have fired your enthusiasm\nmuch more than others and an\ninterest in per suing a career\nconcerned with these may grow.\nYou may decide that your future\ncareer should not be related in\nany way to your degree subject.\nCertain activities within the\ncourse may have been much more\nenjoyable than others.\nMany of you have had experience of employment already\nwhether it is working in a shop or\nfruit picking, laboratory work or\non a construction site. Did you\nlearn anything about your adaptability to various situations and\nenvironments or the ways in\nwhich the activities of others can\nimpinge on your work?\nSpare time interests and hobbies often reinforce the clues we\nfind elsewhere. Those who enjoy\nexperimental work may be involved in other activities of a practical nature. Problem solvers\nmay enjoy puzzles or crosswords,\nchess and bridge are often of\ninterest to those who gain satisfaction from the analysis of\nsituations.\nThese are just some of the\nfacets of your life so far which are\nworth considering before making\na career choice. Writing lists of\nthese factors which are important\nfor you and which you do not\nenjoy or at which you cannot\nexcel can be a useful exercise.\nHaving considered these carefully and added other important\npoints which occur to you the\ntime arrives when you are ready\nto consider what employment is\navailable which allows the expression of your main interest\nand talents.\nUnless you have a wide employment experience it is best to\nconsult a careers adviser at this\nstage because you may have\noverlooked an occupation which\nallows you to combine most of\nyour strengths and which you\ncould find satisfying. If an\nMCAREERS\noccupation suggests itself about\nwhich you know very little it will\nbe necessary to do some research.\nRead some of the literature\navailable in the Careers Advisory\nService. There are some seventy\ninformation booklets available\ncovering most of the careers you\ncould think of. The Register of\nGraduate Employment and\nGraduate Opportunities includes\nsome job information. Take the\nopportunities which present\nthemselves to meet employers\nwith an interest in the kind of\nwork you have in mind. If\npossible arrange to talk to\nsomeone who is doing the job.\nIt is possible to analyse work\nand its content in order to decide\nthe kind of qualifications, skills\nand qualities of character which\nare required. This is of course an\nextremely difficult task if you\nhave a limited knowledge of the\njob area but by asking others for\ntheir views you can look at\nemployment in this way and\nbegin the process of matching\nyour talents to those required by\nemployers for specific posts. For\nsome of you this will be a straightforward exercise; but do\nnot be diss illusion ed if it proves\nto be quite a tough problem. This\nis an area in which the Careers\nAdvisory Service is particularly\ngeared to assist you.\nFELIX\n^Tb KCC\u00a3rT t) Guviac-y7 'ATf\u00a3N^ STc7coN-r5v(/ sj ?\ni% ic,HiFiCAMT OoWTiTifcS\nI NOT AS LAKQE\nWE, Vo'HT H^ VegMCjlJQH\nt> KTA TO JObGE.

Sixty employers will be here for you to approach in the JCR or the Great Hall.\nThe nationalised concerns will be here in force this year: British Telecom, Steel, Gas and Rail suggesting that they may\nhave more vacancies to talk about in 1984.

    "content": "JOB APPLICATIONS AND INTERVIEWS\nMany people, although they are excellently qualified for a job fail to get it because they sell themselves short in the\ninitial stages. Application forms, CVs and interviews are not\nthe best way of telling whether someone is suitable for a job.\nThey are however the only realistic way for employers to\nselect from the hundreds of applicants for a job. If you are to\nget the sort of job you really want it is essential for you to be\nable to do well in these areas.\nThe Application\nEmployers may have to sift\nthrough up to 10,000 application\nforms and so something about\nyour form has got to make them\nwant to meet you, rather than the\nother 9,999 people. Before you\nstart, you've got to believe in\nyourself. You've got to identify\nwhy you're better than average.\nSo you're ordinary are you? You\ncan't be. No two 'ordinary'\npeople are the same, so which\none's ordinary and anyway,\nnobody ordinary gets into\nImperial!\nThe application form is usually\nthe only guide that prospective\nemployers have as to who you\nare. Before they read the form,\nthey won't know that you're an\nabsolute whizz at Quantum\nMechanics but a real bore at\nparties or, on the other hand, that\nyou're destined for a third but are\nloved by students and tutors alike\nfor your sunny personality and\nsparkling wit. There are careers\nfor both.\nYour first hurdle then, is to\nmake the employers read the\nform. If it's illegible, grubby,\ncrumpled, covered in blotches or\nif it's uneasy on the eye for any\nreason, the chances are they\nwon't bother to read it and they'll\nnever find out what a nice person\nyou are.\nAfter reading the form, the\nemployers still won't have found\nout unless you've told them. So\nanswer all the questions as fully\nbut as succinctly as possible and\ndon't be too afraid of letting your\ncharacter show through.\nSo you don't play sport and\nyou don't have any hobbies, you\njust like mooching about with\nyour mates in the bar. Rather\nthan writing 'none' or 'drinking'\nin the hobbies gap, you could put\n'After a full day studying, I enjoy\nrelaxing in the company of good\nfriends discussing anything from\nthe Waldorf case to the meaning\nof life', well something like that.\nBe positive. Don't tell lies, but\nbear in mind the 'half empty, half\nfull' example.\nIt's a good idea to tailor your\nform to the particular job you're\napplying for by emphasising the\nmore relevant aspects of your life\nto date. When you are applying\nto a high technology company do\nstress your most relevant courses\nand experiences. If you're applying to a department store for a management trainee ship, expand\non your Saturday morning shelf-filling at Tescos but merely\nmention briefly the summer\npacking sweets. However, if\nyou're applying to a confectionery manufacturer, it's vice\nversa.\nAs for the ghastly questions\nlike 'Why do you want to work\nfor us?, avoid the temptation to\nput T don't particularly' or 'for\nthe money'. Think about the\ncompany, about the job and\nabout why you chose to apply.\nThe Curriculum Vitae\nThe CV is your opportunity to\nanswer questions you wish you\nwere asked on the application\nform. You should use the opportunity to really sell yourself. As\n' well as vital statistics and previous education you should\nemphasise positions of\nresponsibility and authority you\nhave held.\nCVs tend to be even more\nboring to read in quantity than\napplication forms, so your CV should be clear, concise and free\nof all spelling and grammatical\nerrors.\nThe Interview\nBut my hope is all gone,\nGot the fears comin' on\nAnd III die\nCause I'm crippled with nerves.\nI Dury\nEverybody gets nervous however cool they may seem. A friend\nof mine always takes out her\ncontact lenses when she's going\nto a nerve-racking event and it's true, she always looks calm, cool\nand aloof, until she walks into the\npiano! So don't panic. Most\ninterviewers will allow for your\nnerves and it may help if you\nremember that the interviewers\nare quite likely to be just as\nnervous as you.\nIt helps if you've done your\nhomework. Read through your\napplication form (you did keep a copy didn't you) and think of\nquestions you might be asked.\nFind out about the company\nand make sure you let the\ninterviewer know that you've\ntaken the trouble to find out.\nRelax and enjoy yourself. Tell\nthe interviewer about yourself,\nabout why you're unique, about\nwhy you want the job a 'ld win\nyou're just right for it. If he\nappears to ask you a question in\nRussian which you don't under-stand, say so. Most interviewers\nare not out to trick you, they're,\nthere to find out about you and\nsee if you'd be right for the post\nso, go on, sell yourself!\nAnne-Marie Martin\nCareers Adviser'\n\"There are careers for you\nreal bore at parties, or are\nfor your sunny personality\nwhether you are a real whizz at Quantum Mechanics but a destined for a third but are loved by staff and students alike\nand sparkling wit\"\nFELIX Friday, October 28, 1983 Page 3\n\n"

    "content": "CAREERS\nAfter the milk round?\n'What happens now that I 've failed to get a job on the\nmilk round?' This is the worrying question that many\nstudents face after the round of second interviews. However\nthere are other ways of finding a job. A recent survey showed\nthat the majority of graduates find jobs by other means. So\njust what are the alternatives?\nThrough Advertisements\nAccording to the survey the\nnumber of people finding jobs\nthrough advertisements was\nalmost as large as those finding a job on the milk round. This\nshouldn't really be a surprise\nconsidering the number of publications crammed with job ads\nthat are issued by the professional institutions. So make sure\nyou join your relevant institution\nand subscribe to their journal.\nNational publications may\nalso be used to find jobs. Despite\nthe fact many adverts require\nexperience, companies may\nsometimes take new graduates if\nthey apply. If a job seems\ninteresting, apply.\nPersonnel Contacts\nBelieve it or not 14% of all\ngraduates gain jobs through\nfriends or relatives. Presumably\nthis is mainly because relatives\nmight say that a certain company\nis taking on graduates rather than\npeople being employed in their\nfather's firm, so keep your ears\nopen. Your parents may actually\nknow more than you think.\nSpeculative Applications\nMany people find jobs by writing\n.to firms who they know employ\ngraduates in the areas they are\ninterested in. Sources of information about firms who are likely to\nemploy graduates include the\nWELL THEN, lAR.XIT, WE AT S&rA LTD LIKE TO L ENsM\nft LITTLE' ABOUT THE OUTSIDE INTERESTS OF INTERVIEWEES ,50 WHAT SORT OF THIN OS \"TURN ~<OU ON ? P careers advisory service and\ndirectories like GO (Graduate\nOpportunities) and DOG (Direc-tory of Opportunities for Graduates). However these directories\ncan at times concentrate on\ntechnological jobs and account-an cy. If you decide to make some\nspeculative applications make\nsure they are well written. The\nletter should say what areas of\nwork you are interested in and\nshould be accompanied by a CV\n(which should be brief and\npreferably typed).\nVacancies Advertised by the\nCareers Service\nAs with all large colleges and\nuniversities Imperial has an extensive careers service. Make sure\nthat you actually use it as it will\nprobably have much better con-t acts, resources, etc than you.\nDon't forget that your department may well be able to provide\nyou with some form of careers\nadvice. This is especially useful in\nengineering departments where\nstaff will have an extensive\nknowledge of industry.\nSponsorship\nAs this is a technological college,\nmany students are sponsored. If\nyou are sponsored, why not try\nand persuade your sponsors to\nemploy you? After all they have\ninvested a lot of money in\ntraining you and they do know\nmore about you than any other\ncompany does.\nSummer Recruitment Fair\nAlthough Imperial does not host\none of these, many universities\nhold fairs for firms who have\nvacancies in the summer. The\ncareer's service will be able to tell\nyou where these are being held as\nyou will certainly be able to\nattend fairs at other universities.\nWhile you may not actually get\na job at the fair it will certainly\ngive you some more ideas.\nHopefully this article has been\nof use in that it has suggested\nsome sources of jobs that you had\nnot thought about. However this\nlist is not definitive, so use any\npossible source and you will\nprobably find a job.
