    "content": "Clubs/Sport\nCarnival\nIC CHOIR\nInspired Bach\nBach's St Matthew Passion is one of\nthe few pieces of his in which Bach\nreal lv lets rip his angst. Usually he\nmaintains a professional distance to\nhis music\u2014as did all baroque\ncomposers\u2014producing masses of\ninspired joy and melancholia\ndepending on what his employers\nwanted. It is also packed with a lot\nof the innovation for which Bach is\nstill popular.\nThis was an accomplished performance, and my admiration\ngoes to the soloists, to )oh n Rath for\ncarrying through the part of Christ\nwith suitable dignity, and to Susan\nKessler for simply having a very\npleasant voice. Considering the\nlength of the piece (two hours) and\nthe strain this can have on the vocal\nchords, the Choir did very\ncommendably. I 've never heard\nsuch a terrifying 'Barabbas'.\nThis piece contains masses of\nplain song with banal but important\naccompaniment with the 'cello and\nharpsichord, which can be\nextremely tedious. It reflects on the\nperformers that it was not so.\nIn short a majestic and inspiring\nrendition.\nBOAT\nWin Against\nSurrey\nThe last weekend in January saw IC\ngathering their finest talents for a match against Surrey. The racing\nwent IC's way from the start. In the\nfirst race Bill Chard shot off into the\ndistance and the rest of the team\nfollowed making it a123 for IC.\nThis result was repeated several\ntimes and although Surrey pulled\none back after lunch, an exciting\nclimax saw Liam Moloney clinch the\nmatch 4-1 to us by a foot.\nA week later IC were looking for\nanother win but this time over City\nUniversity. The windy conditions\nmade going tough but this didn't seem to bother the IC team. (One\nmember, Carol, preferred Hara-Kiri\nto leaving the sanctuary of the bar).\nNevertheless the first two races\nwere easily won. If the afternoon\nraces were abandoned when all of\nthe City team capsized in the windy\nconditions\u2014making it 2-0 to IC and\nvet another win. FENCING\nFoiled Again\nThe men came through the\nchallenge round against\nSouthampton last week, avenging\nlast year's defeat. The ladies put up\na fair fight but were unfortunately\nknocked out by Reading (6-3).\nThis week Birmingham men came\nto fence the quarter finals on our\nslippery gym floor. Foil was first,\nwhich Imperial impressively won\n5-4, with both Gully Burns and Ian\nDraper winning one bout each and\nPete Crip well all three. Then the\nsabre, Simon Hoblen stylishly won\nthree bouts, Dave Matthews neatly\nfought his way to one victory,\nSimon Chenery fought valiantly too.\nSo the e pee started at 9 all.\nHere Adam Sadler successfully\nwon all three, Simon Evans,\nperfecting a three week old left-handed style, won two bouts\u2014\nnarrowly losing a third. Pete\nC rip well trounced all three\nopponents\u2014as usual. So Imperial\nwere triumphant, winning 17-10\noverall.\nThis means that the team will face\nthe mighty UCL team at\nSouthampton in the U AU semifinal\nin a few weeks time.\nSCI Fl\nUp-To-Date\nWelcome back after (we hope) a happy Easter. The hardworking\ncommittee have finished\nredecorating the library and cataloguing our books on computer\u2014all we need now are the\nbooks that people still have! If you\nhave any SF library books, please\nbring them back. Our new library is\nat the bottom of the stairs in the SW corner of Beit Quad (diagonally\nopposite from the Union Bar)\u2014we'll\nbe open by 1pm on Thursdays.\nForthcoming attractions: The\nICSF Annual Dinner, provisional\ndate June 7th. Watch this space!\nFriday night sees the last of the Ents\nevents this year. It promises to be\none of the best, if not the best,\nCarnival so far.\nHeadlining is Buster Bloodvessel's band Bad Manners. I'm sure they\nneed no introduction as everyone\nmust have heard songs such as\nSpecial Brew. Lip Up Fatty and the\nCan Can and apparently there is a ska revival so I expect they are set\nfor fame again. We also have\nButterfield 8 which includes 2 ex-members of Madness and have\nrecently been supporting The James\nTaylor Quartet, who played at the\nlast Carnival. Their music is a mixture of swing and jazz played in\na very dance able way. The final\nband pla ving is a new ish Manchester band called Stop\n\u2022 Laughing who are just about to sign\na major recording contract so\npossibly a band to look out for.\nWe don't only have bands on\nshow, in the UD H we have some\ngreat comedy. Top billing goes to\nChris Lynam but also features Pat\nCondell and The Long and the Short of\nit. The com per e for the evening is\nMalcolm Hardy. Not much to say\nabout this lot, why not come along\nand judge for yourself? There will,\nof course, be the great Ents Disco in\nthe Lounge, playing until vo u drop.\nA Casino will be run in the SCR\nwith lots of great prizes. The Union\nBar is open until 2am( Happy Hour\nfrom 8-9pm) and if you like a cocktail or two try the Crush Bar\noutside the Concert Hall. As well as\nburgers in the quad, there is the\nusual free transport home for\nwomen throughout the night.\nTickets are \u00a33 in advance, \u00a34 on\nthe door and \u00a32 to Ents card holders available from Ian Morris in the\nUnion Office. Doors open at 8pm, please get there early to ensure you\nget in! Enjoy it!\n*newsagent near you. I Page 10 FELIX April 28 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Letters\nInteresting\nDear Mr Goodwin,\n' I am writing concerning the article in FELIX\ndated 22nd March 1989 (copy enclosed) entitled\n' A Room With A View'.\n. I would like to object to this article in the\nstrongest possible terms, for the following\nreasons:\n1. The article states 'Chas has been kind enough\nto'write a few words about his room'. I have\nnever written such an article and did not write\nthe' article in question. You have lied to v our readers in printing this statement.\n2. It is quite clear that you or a member of your\nstaff have gained illegal access to mv room.\nWhether this has been facilitated b v the fact that\nvo u are in possession of a BH1 key (the Beit Hall\nmaster key), or whether members of your staff\nwho were working as cleaners in the Hall over\nthe last Summer vacation were able to gain access\nis unclear. The fact remains th af you have gained\nillegal entry to my room, and are pro bab lv able\nto gain access to other residents' rooms.\n3. You or your staff have also looked at my\npersonal files which are confidential. I regard this\nas an invasion of privacy and gross misconduct\non your part.\n1 regard the security of my room as having been\nseriously jeo pardi sed by your actions.\n4. Finally, a joke is a joke, and I would say that\nI am fairly thick-skinned after four years at this\nCollege\u2014but on this occasion you have gone too\nfar. I am going to ask for the appropriate action\nto be taken against you.\nCharles Brereton, Deputy President ICU.\nPS. Just in case you are wondering, the packet\nof 'Mates' condoms was left in one of the drawers\nb v the previous incumbent Mr Alan Rose.\nc.c. Dr John Finley, Warden, Beit Hall,\nMr Geoff Reeves, Chief Security Officer.\nBoring\nDear Mr Goodwin,\nSince you have used your editorial powers to\npublish, in FELIX, what I consider to be a defamatory article, I request that you print this\nletter in the next issue, in full, as my reply.\nI have supported FELIX on Council in ensuring\nthat it maintains its editorial independence of the\nUnion. I will still do so in future. Your readership\nwill judge your choice of adjectives and your\npredilection for expletives. Meanwhile, I will\nsupport your right to fill FELIX in any way you\nchoose. There is only one part of your editorial\npolicy that I will criticise: your distortion of the\ntruth.\nThe first paragraph of your editorial subtitled\n'Blub Blub Blub' in FELIX 22nd March is your\nopinion. I cannot contest it. since I hardly know\nyou I do not feel able to give an opinion of your\ncharacter. I will thus restrict myself to the facts\nwhich you so brazenly misrepresent in your\nwriting.\nLet us examine the second paragraph. There\nvo u state ' Mr Davies is sulking because I forgot\nto print an article he wrote'. At Council you\napologised because you had lost the article. You\ndid not see fit to apologise to me in the week\nbefore the Council meeting though I informed\nyou, through your competent Business Manager,\nLiz Warren, that I wished to speak to you about\nthe non-publication of my article. I am told by\nAdrian Pagan, Publicity Manager for 'The\nPossibilities', that on the Tuesday prior to\npublication he enquired whether the article was\ngoing to be printed. At that time you claimed to\nhave lost it. However your efficient Typesetter,\nRose Atkins, saved the day by producing a new\ncopy. Well Mr Goodwin, did you lose it? Did you\nerase the copy? Did you forget? What am I to\nbelieve?\nBefore I describe the events of Council I should\nturn to your third paragraph where you note the\nindeterminate 'number of times that I have\npointed out in editorials that I cannot guarantee\nto include articles in a given issue'. When I first\npresented the article to you I asked you if it was\nsuitable for publication, volunteering to rewrite\nor shorten it as required. I did this because for\nDramSoc's previous production you had commissioned an article and then refused to print\nit, because, in your opinion, it was badly written\nand trivial. This despite your giving the authors\nminimal guidelines as to what they should write.\nIt was my wish to provide vo u with some literate\ncopy which you would at least consider for\npublication. It would have appeared in the club's pigeonhole had you not pre emptied me.\nOriginally I had requested for the piece to appear\nin FELIX on the Friday week after the Monday\nI presented it to v ou.I made no objection to your\nsuggestion that I should leave the copy with you\nto go in the FELIX that was then in preparation.\nYou did not make a conditional statement, you\nsaid the piece would appear in the current issue\nof FELIX. On the Thursday I decided to help\ncollate FELIX. I do not enjoy collating FELIX but\nit seemed reasonable to help someone who had\nbeen helpful to me. About ten minutes after I had\nstarted collating you came over an apologised to\nme for omitting my article. I accepted your\napology asking if it would appear in the following\nFELIX. You replied in the affirmative, again\nunconditionally, and I continued collating. I did\nnot demand publication, though I'm certain I did\nindicate that I would be upset if the article was\nnot published. I believed that your word was a sufficient bond.\nNoting your description of the article as 'one\nshitty clubs article' I suppose that the omission\nof an apostrophe is intentional but am still unable\nto decide whether you consider my prose fa eca or whether the description is to be read inc un junction with 'the good working relationship\nFELIX has with DramSoc'. Either way I cannot\ncomment on your obsession with human waste\nproducts. Your prose is, after all, part of your\neditorial policy. As a point of fact, I note that\nmembers of FELIX borrowed costumes from\nDramSoc on the Friday, at lunchtime, when my\narticle had failed to appear for the second time.\nI also note that DramSoc members have been\ncalled out in emergencies to fix ailing FELIX/Print\nUnit equipment. The 'good working relationship'\nis beneficial to both of us but it depends on our\nmutual respect and individuals honouring their\nword.\nFinally to return to the Council meeting in question. My motion of censure was based on the\nfact that vo u had, of your own volition, given\nv our word to publish my article on two occasions\nand subsequently rene gue d. In the preamble to\nmv motion I indicated that 1 did not dispute your\nright to control your editorial policy. I only\nwished Council to censure what I believe to be\ndishonour able conduct. Apart from the factual\nerror in v our report of the substance of my\nmotion, in v our editorial vo u neglect to mention\nthat the motion resulted in a tied vote of five-five.\nIt was defeated because insufficient people voted.\nbelieve there were t went v six people present.\nYou have expressed your opinion as to why so\nmany people abstained. Perhaps I might point\nout that these same people did not rush to v our defence as they did when Nigel Baker attempted\nto no-confidence Svdhev Harbour-Bridge at a past Council.\nYour editorial might be excused as a rash\nesp on se to mv proposal at Council. I make no\napology for that motion. Perhaps if you had taken\nan earl er opportunity to apologise it would not\nhave been necessary to move this proposal. Your\neditorial went from composition to printing in less\nthan t went v four hours. 1 commend v our efficiency but suggest that when conducting\ncharacter assassinations one should reflect and\ncheck one's facts.\nMv thanks to the person who pointed out your\neditorial to me on the night it was collated for\nallowing me to take his her copy when vo u refused to give me one.\nYours sincerely.\nRoger Davies, SCAB Chairman.\nTragic\nDear Bill.\nThe FELIX Staff would like to offer their\ndeepest apologies for deserting you this term but\nunfortunately we're all students and have exams.\nI hear that vo u have an urge to do some revision,\neven though you've finished your degree, so I'm sure vo u won't mind helping us with ours. Enjoy\nal those late night stints\u2014after all, you'll be able\nto survive on three hours sleep a night for the\nrest of your life after this term.\nLove and kisses,\nThe Staff.\nAmazing and\nfabulous\nDear Bill,\nI would love to write you a letter telling\neveryone what a wonderful Easter holiday I had.\nI would like to recount all the amazing things I did and the fabulous people I met. And despite\nall this I would like to be able to tell you that I did loads of revision and can breeze through my\nexams. However, I can't. Yours,\nDoug King.\nPage 2. FELIX April 28 1989\n\n"

Check it\nout, if you want to hear one of this\nyear's truly exciting releases.\nBy Carl Kent-Smith\nJesus votes Tory\nby Dylan James Some Christians assume that it is\ntheir moral duty to be Socialist,\nhowever I intend to show that\nSocialism and Christianity are\nincompatible. 1 shall start with the\nWelfare State\u2014a system which\ncauses many to think Socialism is\nmore Christian than Toryism.\nWhat should be the Christian\nattitude towards government and\nthe Welfare State? Should we\ntranslate Christ's concern for the\npoor into government care for the\nhomeless? We should remember\nwhat Christ said. In all his teaching\nhe always calls on us as individuals\nto personally take responsibility for\nthe problems we see: he never\nasked for action from the state. We\nare all called to give to the poor, feed\nthe hungry and shelter the\nhomeless. This is not the job of a collective state.\nWe should consider the effect the\nWelfare State has on individuals.\nManv see government programmes\nas a replacement for chari tv work by\nvolunteers, but as Christians we\nshould realise how dangerous this\nconcept is. If the government is\nresponsible for the needy what is\nthe role of the Christian? Some\ncomplacently fall into the attitude\nthat we don't need to do more\nourselves: It'sup to the\ngovernment.' This reliance on government can cause the\nindividual to isolate himself from\nthe problems of the poor.\nFor example, in the earlier Church\nit was traditional to give 10% of v our income to chari tv. but this tradition\nhas faded out. Many Christians feel\ngovernment has replaced their need\nto give, including a Baptist minister\nI know, who said of the 10% 'people\npay more than that in taxes.' Surely\nwe should not wash our hands of\nthe problems of others simply\nbecause government is trying to\nhelp them as well. However, when\nthe state intervenes in a situation\nthere is a tendency to forget about\nour continuing responsibility.\nAs Christians we encourage\nparticipation in community projects\nas they foster a caring community\nattitude. But any government\nprogramme tends to create apathy\nrather than the positive outgoing\nfeeling that comes from the work of\nindividuals. For this reason we must\ntr v to avoid government\nintervention in welfare and should,\ninstead, promote personal\nbenevolence.\nThough some Christians call for\nincreased government welfare\n(believing it is their moral duty), it\ncreates an apathetic culture in which\npeople feel they are only responsible\nfor themselves. If the devil was to\nchoose what sort of society he\nwanted, this is just what he would\nchoose! It is ironic that some\nChristians are doing the devil's work for him.\nTo encourage government\nintervention in welfare after\nrealising its effect is irresponsible,\nand saying it is necessary to\neliminate poverty is only a 'the end\njustifies the means' argument. Any work done by government can be\ndone by a charity; this is what\nChristians should be promoting. For\na Christian the question is not\nwhether the disadvantaged should\nbe cared for, but how it should be\ndone.\nAt first glance Socialism and Christianity might have seemed\nvery compatible as both call for the\npower and money of the rich to be\ngiven to the poor. However,\nSocialism alwa vs translates this aim\ninto government enforced schemes,\nnot the voluntary giving Christ asks\nfor. As I have said, such\ngovernment schemes form a self-centred, apathetic society, and as\nsuch schemes are art intrinsic part\nof Socialism, the Christian has no\nchoice but to denounce Socialism as\nthe work of Satan.\nToryism (at first glance) might\nseem self-centred, but this is only a popular misconception\u2014this is not\nwhat Toryism is really about; the\nTory party is the party of Active\nCitizenship. We believe it is better\nto have a job done by willing\nindividuals than to have it done by\nmercenary bureaucrats who may\nnot personally care about the job\nthey are doing. The purpose of\nreducing taxation and government\nis to both alert individuals to their\nresponsibility and to enable them to\npursue it by letting them choose to\nuse their money to help others.\nIt is true that the generous\neconomic situation under the Tories\nis abused by some self-centred\nYuppies, but this is not our intention. We have no need of such\npeople. The scale of such abuse is\nonly due to the false philosophy\n(caused by the present existence of\nthe Welfare State) that 'what the\ngovernment doesn't take is mine.'\nThe removal of the Welfare State\nwill send a clear message to all that\nthey should personally give to\ncharity. The removal of the Welfare\nState will have to be gradual and in\nphases, but it must be done.\nThe aim of the Tory Party is to\ncreate a society of Active Citizens,\nin which people care for each other\ninstead of leaving it to the\ngovernment. Surely this is exactly\nwhat Christians are striving for.\nThe views expressed are the\nauthor's and not necessarily those\nof IC Conservative Society or IC Christian Union.\nApril 28 1989 FELIX Page 9\n\n"

The only thing standing\nbetween her and a murder charge\nis your life.'\nBut Blackwood has all he requires\u2014a blossoming romance\nwith a beautiful girl and one or two\nmysterious happenings to provide\nPeter Swift with a new adventure.\nUntil a string of accidents begins\nand the uncertainty of his position\nbecomes all too apparent.\nThe often used device of narrative\ntalk over has been heard in movies\nsince the first dusky gumshoe flicks\nright up to the present day, in the\nlikes of Bladerunner and of course\nMagnum. The same trick is\nemployed in Her Alibi, with Selleck\n'reading' the new Swift novel as the\nevents it portrays unfold on screen.\nThis done to great effect, since\nBlackwood is blinded by love but\nlost in caution and doubt, while his\nalter-ego Peter Swift is the dashing,\nsure-footed hero who takes\neverything in his stride. The\ncontrast between-Blackwood's life\nand the parallel fantasy world he\ninhabits on paper provides the basis\nfor the film's humour.\nSelleck copes admirably with the\ncomedic requirements, as is to be\nexpected from his previous roles,\nand although he himself sees the\ncharacter as very different, the\nsimilarities to Thomas Magnum are\n'Would Sir like something for the weekend?'\nMeasure for\nMeasure\nThe Young Vic The storyline pivoting around role\nreversals has been seen often in recent months in such films as Vice\nVersa and Big and a host of others.\nThis overworked theme, seemingly\nonly out-clich ed by 'Buddy movies'\nhas its roots deep in the past in, for\nexample, The Prince and the Pauper',\nand earlier still in Measure for\nMeasure, and even the Bible\nShakespeare though provides\nmore than just an evening's entertainment. Here he engages in some cutting political observation,\nas the narrative parodies the new\nKing James. It also offers a lesson of\nsorts to the puritanical audience,\nparalleling good cold cash with good\nhot sex, to show that in love and\ncommerce the value of what we\npossess depends on how we spend\nit.\nEnough of the literature lesson,\nhere's the plot: Duke Vincentio,\nruler of Vienna, leaves town for a while and puts power in Angelo's lap. He in turn invokes strict laws\nand pulls down the brothels.\nShame. But worse still he imprisons\nClaudio, and sentences him to\ndeath, for getting his girlfriend in\nthe club. By chance Claudio has a soul-mate in Lucio who searches out\nhelp in the form of Claudio's sister\nIsabella. She, being the black sheep\nof the family, is about to become a nun. She postpones her vows to\nplead with Angelo.\nAngelo is adamant, but offers\nClaudio's life in exchange for\nIsabella's virginity. Boys will be\nboys. In doing so, he is as guilty as\nClaudio himself, at least in mind if\nnot body.\nMeanwhile, the Duke is parading\naround in a robe, learning all this\nunder the guise of a friar. He comes\nup with a clever plan to save\ntransparent and the movie gains\nfrom this.\nHis leading lady is Paulina\nPorizkova, a Czech, and currently\nthe world's highest paid model, and\nno wonder; she has the looks to\ncapture the undivided attention of\nany male audience. She can act\npretty well too, and makes short\nwork of endowing her character\nwith flair and panache, whilst\nretaining the element of mystery\nwhich confuses Blackwood so\nmuch. 'Do any of us ever really\nknow the person we fall in love\nwith?', he writes.\nThe pairing is wonderful, and the\ntwo are supported by a fairly strong\ncast and a decent plot. The humour\ncomes thick and fast, and the release\ndate of May 12th makes Her Alibi an\nideal way of breaking the stress of\nexams.\nAndrew Clarke.\nClaudio, entrap Angelo and, with a bit of luck, win the admiration and\nhand of Isabella.\nWhat opens as a tragedy, with\nClaudio's death a dead cert, swings\nbetween happy and sad endings as\nShakespeare invents new characters\nto help himself out of tight corners.\nAlong the way there are a few\ncomedic set pieces, chiefly involving\nPompey, a mix of AI Capone and\nArthur Daley, and wide boy Lucio.\nThe text, while not the simplest of\nthe Bard's works is nevertheless\naccessible.\nThe performances are good too, in\nparticular Rob Edward's detached,\nyet observant, Duke and Stephen\nJenn's stubbornly confused Angela.\nThey are both out-shone by Dominic\nLetts, a flamboyant and swaggering\nLucio.\nThe Young Vic provides an\ninformal, relaxed fringe setting,\nwhile retaining an intensity and\ncloseness strongly advantageous to\nany lengthy performance. And it\noffers concessions for students too,\nso it can't be bad.\nAndrew Clarke.\nMetropolis\nDown at the Piccadilly Theatre, just\noff the Circus, London's newest\nmusical has recently opened. Taking\nFritz Lang's1927 futurist vision\nfrom the silver screen to the stage\nis an ambitious project considering\nthe scale of the original.\nMetropolis is, in essence, a love\nstory set against a backdrop of\nservile oppression. A cast of over\n37,000 and a cost of seven million\nMarks gave the movie a spectacular\nappearance. Michael White's production captures a little of this\nthough ultimately the small stage\nenforces an insurmountable limitation. The cast numbers 40, but\nthe cost remains a comparable \u00a3 3\nmillion. It's all yours for a mere\n\u00a38.50 on student standby.\nThe curtain opens to an incredible\nset of pipes, gantries, valves and\nwheels which make up the Pater\nNoster machine. Populating this are\nthe workers, busying themselves en\nmasse in a scene reminiscent of the\nwhite mice from 'Bagpuss' whilst\nchanting the opening number\n'101.11' with gusto. A blast of\ntriumphant dynamism.\nThe people are unhappy, and led\nby Maria (Judy Kuhn), about to\nembark on a little worthwhile\nanarchy. High above, the city is\nruled by Freeman (Brian Blessed),\ncontrolling everything from a huge\nbubble which swings impressively\nfrom the skies. His estranged son\nSteven (Graham Bickley) heads off\nto the underworld for a look-see and\nfalls in love with Maria.\nChanging places with a worker,\nGeorge, Steven witnesses a rebels'\nPage 6 FELIX April 28 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Opinion\nTurn up, turn off, drop out\nDoes Imperial College produce disillusioned, disheartened students? Is there more to\na university education than a hard slog? Are academics out of touch with the real needs\nof the students. Sydney Harbour Bridge thinks so....\nI joined this College six years ago\nalong with a number of other fresh\nand enthusiastic young 18 and 19\nyear-olds. Among them were two\npeople who we shall, for arguments\nsake, call Giles and Caroline. At the\nend of the second year Giles and\nCaroline were very different to all\ntheir friends who had entered with\nthem. This was not because they\nunless you are going\nto get a2:1 or a first\nclass degree Imperial\nwill give you a very\nraw deal\nwere disillusioned with IC, bored\nwith its lack of insight or tired of\nbeing overworked as many of their\nfriends were. Giles and Caroline\nwere different because they were no\nlonger at IC. Giles had managed to\nfail his first year exams a total of four\ntimes in two years and Caroline,\nhaving struggled in her first year,\nleft before reading her second year\nexams. Both, much to their\nsuccessful' friends' surprise,\nobtained places in their respective\nsubjects (Mech Eng and Elec Eng) at\nKings College. Giles and Caroline\nhave now graduated from Kings\nwith a Universitv of London degree,\nexact lv as their fellows at IC did, but\nwithout that prestigious\nqualification, the Associateship of\nCity & Guilds. The interesting fact\nis that they both graduated with first\nclass Honours. What's more Giles\nwas informed that his grades were\nhigher than any previously gained\nby a student on his course.\nBoth Giles and Chris thoroughly\nenjoyed their time at Kings, experiencing a lively social life\nwhilst experimenting in other mind\nbroadening a citi vi ties which added\nfurther to their CV's. I had a chat with Giles over a pint\nwhen he was halfway through his\nsecond year. Giles commented;\n'Failing at IC was the best thing that\never happened to me!' He left the\npub at 8pm to do that week's problem sheets and returned by\n\"tO pm having doubtlessly got an ' A' grade in the intervening hours.\nMembers of staff at IC will tell you\nthat an Imperial Degree is worth\nmore than a Kings Degree and so it\nma v be; it certainly was in the past.\nMind you, if Giles or Caroline do\nnot wish to enter the Engineering\nfield which is, after all, underpaid\nthey will find that most employers\nview Imperial and Kings degrees\nsimply as Degrees of the University\nof London.\nWho came out best off, Giles or\nthe person who beat him in his IC\nexams by possibly only two or three\nper cent? That person probably\nstruggled through his College for\nthree years and graduated as a dejected disillusioned student,\nperhaps only to gain a third or a pass degree. Try telling that person\nthe system is fair!\nIt is my belief that unless you are\ngoing to get a2.1 or first class\ndegree, Imperial will give you a very\nraw deal. Thev work you very hard,\ncontact hours are higher than in\nalmost any university in Britain,\nteaching standards generally very\nlow, the opinions of the staff has a marked affect on your exam results\nand the intention is to throw as\nmuch information at you as possible\nover as short a time as possible \u2014\nto hell with trying to get the\nmessage across. Worse than this,\nthe College, knowingly or not, is\nreducing the access of students to\nother important activities.\nThere are two sides to a university\neducation and academia is only one\nof them. If IC graduates are to\nsucceed in a variety of different\nactivities after College they must\nleave with a rounded character.\nHere I must qualify the position by\nstating that some exceptional\nstudents have managed to achieve\nboth areas, but then again so many\nthat arrived here with great promise\nhave not. The system is truly good\nfor the excellent but how many must\nfall b v the wayside or to a2.2. The Rector will of course tell you,\nas he once told the Governing Body\nthat students at IC are quite happy\nthankyou very much. After all, he\nshould know\u2014he has been Rector\nhere for three years and was a student here in the 1950s. But is the Rector really in touch\nwith ordinary students? Last year\nProfessor Ash told me that he could\nnot find one day in the whole year\nto go around College and see it from\na student's point of view.\nHe was so out of touch with the\nfinancial problems face'd by students\nthat his first comment to me, as\nUnion President, was 'I hope you\nare going to push for an increase in\nthe student residential stock without\nquibbling about rents'\u2014ignoring the\nfact that we already have the highest\nrents in the university system. I fail\nto see how a man like this has the\naudacity to make any comment on\nthe teaching at IC.\nThe majority of College staff will\nagree with the Rector's opinion but\nit is this arrogant state of self-'failing IC was the\nbest thing that ever\nhappened to me'\nimportance prevalent in IC that cost\nGiles an 'Imperial Degree'. The\nCollege can spend as much time as\nit likes trying to con students into\ncoming to IC with fancy\nprospectuses and talks with school\nteachers, but I refuse to have\nanything to do with it.\nIn the past the College has tried\nto ensure that the Union's Alternative Prospectus should be\nwritten by a 'high performing\nstudent'; one of the ones who isn't getting a raw deal. Well they\nhaven't got enough time or enough\nguts to risk a decent degree by\ntelling the truth.\nIf the Rector wants to increase the\npercentage of women at IC he\nshould deal with the problems in\nthe social life rather than making\nthem believe it's a wonderful place.\nYet the organiser of the Women in Science & Engineering (WISE)\nSubstitute Female Recruitment\nConference, told me two years ago\n' Oh we couldn't do that we don't want them meeting any IC men,'\nwhen I offered to organise a series\nof free disco parties for what was a very bored bunch of school girls.\nImperial's reputation is flagging\nand the cost of living here is\nincreasing. If the Academics want to\nsave their jobs they'd better start\ntaking some pride in their teaching\nand in their students.\nOne cheering last note, remember\nif you fail the impending exams you\ncan always leave and go to Kings,\nor Manchester, or Leeds, or Bath, or\nalmost anywhere you might find it's cheaper.\nApril 28 1989 FELIX Page 5\n\n"

    "content": "Food\nby Yishu Nanda\nItalian Delights\nThe columnist recently returned from a two week gastronomic tour of\nLombardy, Emilia and Venato. In a four part series of articles he will take\nus through the experience of cuisine familial e in a Milan kitchen, the food\nthat makes Emilia-Romagna world famous, an evening with an experienced\nBolognese cook and the joy of eating with the Veneti. This series was only\npossible due to the assistance afforded by Luca Zullo and Elena Donvito.\nPart 1\nBologna\u2014II culto del bene esse re( the way of happy living)\nI find that every year I pass through\na stage where I feel that the food\nthat 1 serve has lost its sparkle. The\nnew ideas pruned from different\nparts of the world and learned from\nwatching friends cook have been\ntaken on board and integrated. This\nis the time to go abroad to allow the\ningredients, aromas and colours of\nunfamiliar cuisine to inspire one to\ndiversify one's culinary repertoire.\nThere could not be a better way\nto start than to go to EmiliaRomagna. The cuisine of this region\nof Italy came to the forefront\nbecause it dominated the cuisine\ndescribed in Pellegrino Artusi's La\nScienza in Cucina e VArte di Mangiare\nBene (1891). (Culinary science and\nthe art of eating well.) Bologna in\nparticular established a reputation as\na gastronomic centre of Italy. I discovered that the people of this\nregion have an insatiable capacity to\ntalk about food and to consume it\nin gluttonous proportions.\nOn a student budget it was not\npossible to eat out at any of the\nregion's restaurants recommended\nby James Johnson in the Sunday\nTimes' classic nine-part series titled\nthe Taste of Italy. A friend in Bologna\nrecommended the Trattoria Casa\ndelle A ie( Via delle A ie4,0544927631) at Cervia on the\nAdriatic coast. The tr at tori a is\nhoused in an 18th century house\nthat is run by the Ministry of Fine\nArts. As the government is involved\nyou can be sure to get a good deal.\nThe local dishes, the local wines and\nthe home made Romagnol bread\ncan all be sampled. A full meal will\ncost you about \u00a311 per head\u2014a paltry sum to pay for fine art. Do not\nmiss the opportunity to eat here if\nyou are in the area.\nWith my pocket full of petty cash\nI consigned myself to walking the\nshady porticos of Bologna and\nseeing the produce that has made\nEmilia-Romagna world famous.\nProsciutto di Parma (Parma Hams),\nhams branded with the crown of\nParma are salted, dried and matured\nover a period of a year to yield a cured meat that has a lovely pink\ncolour, a light aroma and a taste that\nis only slightly salty. The result is a ham which is the most popular\nantipasto in Italy and can cost as\nmuch as \u00a318 per kilo.\nThe most exciting ingredient in\nItalian food must be Parmigiano\nReggiano (Parmesan Cheese). This\nhard cheese can only be made from\nmilk produced between April and\nNovember in production zones\nspecified b v law. The cheese can be\neaten after as little as a year's maturation when it is known as\nnuovo. After another year it develops\na stronger flavour and it is known\nas vecchio. It may even be matured\nfor a third year.\nThe choice of pastas available in\nBologna is large. The purists insist\nthat pasta should be freshly made\nand rolled out by hand using a wooden rolling pin because this\ngives a rougher finish to the pasta\nenabling it to hold the sauce better.\nThis enhances the pleasure of eating\nit.\nBologna and Modena are the\nhome of tor tell in i. It can often be\nseen being prepared by the women\nwho work in the shops that sell\npasta. The square of pasta with the\nfilling, is folded into a triangle and\nwound into shape\u2014the shape of\nVenus's navel as legend has it.\nBologna Mortadella a smooth pork\nsausage is another delicacy that\ncannot be missed. The larger sizes\nof this pork sausage are considered\nthe finest and can cost about \u00a315 per\nkilo. 1 found it quite convenient to\ntry many of these regional favourites\nat lunch. The porticos were\npeppered with bars that also\ndisplayed a wide range of cured\nmeats and freshly baked bread. It\nwas possible to get custom-made\nsandwiches using whichever\ningredients you fancied.\nPart 2\nLong live c uni ap over a The columnist shares the experience\nof an evening in the kitchen with a friend's grandmother, a passionate\nBolognese cook.\nA proud 77 year-old, Nonna\n(Grandmother) Zelina insisted that\nshe was not a bella anymore but\nvec cia( old). Remembering the\nterminology of maturing cheeses I agreed that she was vec cia but not\nquite str avec cia( very old). We both\nchuckled.\nZelina told me that the method of\npreparing the regional favourites\nhad not changed in her kitchen for\nthe past fifty years. She was very\nproud of the Emilian cuisine and of\nthe tradition of Bologna. She\nproduced her copy of the L 'Artusi\nbefore giving a demonstration of\nhow to make crescent in e: puffs of\nBologna\u2014A major centre of learning in Italy'\nwheat with a crispy skin and a fluffy\ninterior. The dough was divided\ninto balls the size of small apples\nand rolled out into oval discs using\na wooden rolling pin on a large\nwooden board. Waving the pin and\npointing to the board she said that\nit had taken her more than a decade\nto master the use of the equipment\nto be able to make fresh pasta such\nas tagliatelle. There was a sadness\nin her voice as she knew that it is\na skill that is fast disappearing as it\nis not being taken up b v the younger\ngeneration.\nThe oval discs of dough were\nshallow fried to make the crescent in e. They were very simple to make\u2014\nthe secret being to make the dough\nto the right consistency. The\ncrescent in e were served with razor\nthin slices of prosciutto crud o, salami, pickled onions and lightly\nboiled vegetables (sweet peppers,\naubergine s, courgette s) in an olive\noil and vinegar dressing.\nShe insisted that the king of the local\ncuisine (the tor tell in i) has 'his own taste' and must be eaten cooked in\na meat broth and not with arag u( meat sauce). Indeed, if one uses\nregal ingredients like mortadella,\npar meg gia no and pork to stuff the\ntor tell in i, one does not want to\ndisguise it in arag u. Bollito mis to the\nsecond pillar of the local cuisine is\na tribute to slow cooking. A wide\nrange of meats including whole\nchicken, rabbit, beef, tongue,\nzam pon c( stuffed pigs trotters) and\ncote chino are simmered on a low\nflame for several hours until the\nmeat is very tender and the liquid\nhas turned into a tasty broth. The\nmeat is served on a platter in\nmanageable pieces. It is eaten\ntogether with a vegetable sauce such\nas salsa verde.\nShe pointed out that Romagnol\ncuisine is different than that of\nEmilia. In Emilia the stuffed pasta\nis preferred in a small compact\nshape, but in Romagna it is larger,\nknown as agno l lot ti. The agno l lot ti have a sweeter taste because they\nalso contain squash.\nIt was not enough to talk about\nthe best Bolognese cooking, Zelina\ntold me to go to eat at Ristorante\nDiana (24A Via Dell Indipendenza,\nthe road that links the railway\nstation to the Piazza Maggiore). She\nhad known Diana's reputation even\nbefore the last war. I tried the\ntor tell in i in bro do and the bill it om is toe salsa verde. The two course\nmeal without antipasti and dolce,\nbut with a half litre of house wine\ncost \u00a318. The impeccable service and\nwarm atmosphere helped make the\ngood food into a success. I implore\nyou not to miss some of Bologna's gastronomic crown jewels if you\nmake a visit to this city.\nContinued next week.\nPage 4 FELIX April 28 1989\n\n"

Their employers'\npay negotiators, the CVC P has\nwithdrawn from formal talks and\nnow refuses to take the dispute to\nindependent arbitration.\nMr Baker's motion, calls for a recognition of the AUT's new policy\non setting and marking of exams\nand the CVC P's withdrawal from\nnegotiations. It claims that the\nCVC P's action 'now represents the\ngreatest threat to this year's examination process,' and 'can only\nbe to the deter i ment of the future of\nhigher education.' The motion\ninstructs Mr Baker to write to the\nleaders of the AUT and the CVC P to indicate IC Union's new stance\nagainst the CVC P and to express its\nfears for the future of higher\nedu action. In addition the motion\ninstructs IC Union Officers 'to\nsupport the AUT in the aims of the\naction, though not the means and\nto condemn the CVC P for its policy\nof non-negotiation.' Mr Baker\nsummed up the motion, saying 'We\nneed to start pressure on the CVC P now rather than the AUT to actually\nget this thing resolved.'\nIC ALT President, Susan Parry\nsaid she was 'very pleased' by the\nmotion and added that with the new\naction they now felt they had their\nmembership fully behind them. The effects of the AUT' s change\nin policy are already evident in the\nCivil Engineering department,\nwhere a previously boycotted\nexamination is to be held at 8 days\nnotice next week. Mr Baker told\nFELIX that he intends to gain the\nRector's assurance that students will\nbe given 3 weeks notice for\nre timetabled examinations in the\nfuture.\nFive members of Imperial College's Christian Union were amongst\nthose trapped in the Alton Towers\nsky lift disaster on Good Friday.\nThe students were trapped for an\nhour when their carriage was blown\ninto a supporting pillar bringing the\nwhole ride to a halt.\n'We could see it coming but there\nwas nothing we could do' said\nAthos Ritsperis.\nThe students were eventually\nrescued by the Fire Brigade.\nRoy Hicks takes early retirement\nThe Union Bookshop manager, Roy\nHicks, has taken early retirement\nfollowing investigations into the\nbookshops' \u00a3T6k trading deficit last\nterm. The running of the bookshop\nhas now been taken over by Union\nManager, Dave Peacock.\nMr Peacock commented, ' Mr Hicks resignation highlights the\nenormous stresses associated with\nbeing the manager of a trading\noutlet these days.'\nThe deficit came to light in December, when the Union received audited profit and loss\naccounts from the College. Auditors\nwere .called in to investigate the\nreasons for the losses and in March\npresented a report recommending\nimproved security, rational is ation of\nperson el and financial proceed ure s, tighter stock and sales controls and\nthe introduction of Electronic Point\nof Sales (EPOS) equipment.\nThe introduction of EPOS equipment and a possible refit of the\nshop are under consideration b v the\nUnion, but a number of\nimprovements including more\nreliable cashing proceed ure s and\nsigning staff on and off tills have\nbeen introduced since Mr Hicks'\nretirement.\nMuch of the deficit has arisen\nbecause of the large stock levels held\nwithin the bookshop, particularly\nbooks recommended by lecturers,\nwhich prove unpopular with students.\nMr Peacock told FELiX that he is\ncurrently trying to reduce the stock\nlevels by selling of ft books at half\nprice and returning unpopular\nbooks bought on 'sale or return.'\nThe Union are considering plans\nto restrict the bookshop's stock to\npopular academic texts and to use\nthe extra space generated for the\nsale of greetings cards, toiletries and\nelectrical goods.\n'If any students or staff have ideas\non which products we should stock\nlet us know in writing', said Mr Peacock.\nThe Union was given full control\nof the bookshop Committee in July\n1988. The profits from the shop are\ndistributed between Imperial\nCollege Union and the Consituent\nCollege Unions with an annual rent\nof \u00a34000 being paid to the College.\nISSUE 833 28 APR 1989 \u00ab,\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX\nEditorial\nAUT The Association of University Teachers (AUT) have backed\ndown in their decision not to set examination papers. Final\nyear students worried about having to re-sit another year\ncan now breath a sigh of relief.\nIt now falls upon the Student Unions to lend their full\nsupport to the AUT's claim.\nDespite what the Committee of Vice Chancelors and\nPrincipals (CVCP) would have us believe, the dispute has\nnothing to do with greedy academics demanding money\nwhich is not theirs to be had. It has everything to do with\nacademics being paid a decent salary for the work they\ncarry out.\nBut the implications behind the dispute are much deeper.\nIf the British Universities refuse to pay academics a reasonable salary they should not expect to attract the high\nquality people that Britain needs to maintain education\nstandards. In the end, it is education which will suffer.\nImperial College Union will be holding an Emergency\nGeneral Meeting on Tuesday to discuss the latest\ndevelopments in the AUT dispute and I urge you to attend.\nThe Union will be proposing a motion which calls for\npressure to be applied to the CVCP to reconsider the AUT's pay claim. It is a motion that we would be foolish to ignore.\nClubs and Sports\nI would like to see the Clubs and Sports pages expanded\nthis term. Unfortunately I cannot do this unless social and\nsports clubs are willing to submit articles.\nI believe that a couple of clubs have had problems with\narticles being cut because of lack of space. Hopefully, if\nwe receive enough articles, I will be able to allocate an extra\npage to clubs and sport and lack of space will cease to be\na problem.\nIf anyone is interested in editing or proofing clubs or\nsports articles they should get in touch. Film is available\nfrom the FELIX office free of charge for any sporting clubs\nwilling to take photographs at Harlington.\nFELIX\nUnfortunately because I have had to attend interviews this\nweek this edition of FELIX is a little thinner than I would\nhave liked.

    "content": "Music\nWhen did you last see a band who\nscared you? The total\nunpredictability of the situation\nlending a more than even chance\nthat you, and those around you,\nwill in some way, become drawn\ninto the violence being perpetrated\njust feet away on stage.\nThis is no act. When Lee launches\nhis guitar at Kale and connects with\na vengeance fifteen feet away\u2014then\nyou know. When the front row\nwant to be gouged by vicious\nFenders\u2014you know. When the road\ncrew come on and stare in disbelief\nat the carnage and destruction\u2014\nthen you know.\nThis interview was conducted\nbefore the twenty minute\nconfrontation that was Birdland\ndestroying Dingwalls on March\n13th. When Birdland speak, it's often as one voice; and impossible\nto keep track of who said what. For\nthe record though; Lee (guitar) and\nKale (bass) do a lot of the talking,\nwith Sid (drums) chipping in,\nRobert (vocals) preferred to remain\ndetached and almost elsewhere,\nwith his brother Lee representing\nboth him and his songs.\nI 've heard you play live, hut I haven't heard any material apart from Hollow\nHeart on SNUB. How would you\ndescribe your music?\nB: How would you describe it Kale?\nSort of psychedelic punk. More\nenergetic.\nLee: Energetic. Sharp. Sharp,\npointed. Like when you get a brand\nnew pencil, and it's sharp, so sharp\nyou can poke anyone's eye out with\nit. It's as sharp as that.\nKale: There's a lot of frustration in\nit. You're fed up of these shit bands\nwho just stand there on stage and\nplay. There's no performance there.\nWe've got a lot of energy and that's really good.\nSo when you^play is it all spontaneous,\nor do you work anything out\nbeforehand?\nLee: No. The only things we work\non is the songs and that's it. 'Cos\nif we worked on any moves we did\non stage it'd look false. And we're\nnot false. Anything can happen in\nthe next half hour before we go on\nstage and when we go on stage. It's always like that.\nDo you ever actually get to play a full\nset or do you trash the instruments\nbefore you even get through it?\nNo. That is a full set, what we do.\nEven when that means two songs?\nB: Yeah, that can be' a full set. It\ndoesn't matter. It depends how we\nfeel on the night. If we feel like\ndoing a set with only two songs\nthen we do two songs. Most people\ncome along and they're complaining\nafterwards that they've paid \u00a33 or\nwhatever and they just want to see\na40 minute show by a band, even\nif the band are pissed off. We don't wanna do that. Our heart's in it,\neven if we play for seven minutes.\nIf people wanna see a fifty minute\nrock show that's their fault you\nknow.\nHave you got much of a following?\nB: Yeah. But not a lot of that.\n(Laughs.) You could say a following.\nEvery time we do a gig we get\ntwenty or thirty people afterwards\nsaying it was brilliant. So we're\nbuilding up something at the\nmoment, you know what I mean?\nLee: People are coming along and\njust staring at us at the moment.\nThey dunno what to think, they\ndunno what to do sort of thing. 'Cos\nmost people are just used to you\nstanding there and looking at the\nfloor and being dead boring. And then when they see us and we're\nenergetic they just can't believe it.\nSo would you appreciate a bit more\naudience participation?\nLee: That'sO K if they want to do\nthat. We'll just hit them over the\nhead with a guitar if they want to\nget on stage. We get paranoid that\nthey'll want to stab us. It'sO K if\nthey're going mad down the front,\nbut not at the side. The stage is small\nenough at the moment without\nanyone else on.\nYou're getting really over the top\nreviews. How do you feel about\ncomments like that, doesn't it give you\na lot to live up to?\nIt's not hype. We're getting a lot of\nall this bullshit about hype. Hype\nhas got nothing to do with us\u2014it's just promotion. But I'm sure that in\nsix months people are going to turn\naround and say shit. But that\ndoesn't matter to us.\nDo you believe that you're that good?\nKale: Yeah. We'd be idiots if we\nthought anything else, if we thought\nwe were crap. There'd be no point\nbeing in a band. Thinking we're\ncrap doesn't even come into our\nheads. That's why it's horrible\nwhen bands think; 'we'll make it big\nin the Indie scene, and that's all we\nwant to do'. We want to be massive.\nWhat do you think you'd be doing if you\nweren't in a band?\nB: We'd be dead.\nIt sounds like you've got all your future\nplans worked out, have you got\nanything specific coming up?\nNot really at the moment. It's just\nto do what we want, to make\nrecords in exactly the way we want,\nno manipulation at all. We're so\narrogant we can't do it any other\nway, we can't listen to anyone else.\nYou've mentioned a couple of current\nbands, what are your favourite bands at\nthe moment?\nPixies, Sonic Youth. There's a lot of\nthings. House of-Love. Those are\nthe bands at the moment.\nI haven't heard the EP yet, what can\nwe expect on that, what are the songs\nabout?\nI think you'll be surprised. Yeah,\nyou'll be surprised. Hopefully you'll\nlike it.\nAre the songs written about any specific\ninstances, or are they just blasts of\nadrenal in? Robert: I can't really say. You just\nhave to listen. Make your own mind\nup about it.\nI'm constantly reading about your\namazing on-stage energy. How do you\nkeep it up? Do you take any drugs?\nNo, no. It's just adrenal in, it's just\nthere. No drugs. It's like people\nsaying we're being sick and stuff,\nbut before we go on we're drinking\norange juice. (Birdland are referring\nto the infamous fane's Addiction\nsupport slot, from which they were\nthrown off after allegations of them\ndestroying equipment on stage\nduring their set and throwing up in\nthe dressing room before the gig.)\nIt's totally natural, there's no drugs\ninvolved. If we took anything like\nspeed we'd probably blow up\nanyway. We wouldn't be able to do\nit if we took drugs, you've got to be\nin control of what you're doing. It's just natural adrenal in that we\nsiphon off.\nWhat iv as the truth behind the Jane's Addiction tour stories then?\nIt was bollocks that was. We trashed\na mike stand, and they reckoned we\nwere sick in the toilets. That's no\nexcuse to get kicked off the tour\nanyway. We just blew them off,\nnicked their audience and that was\nit.\nLee: We just went down really well.\nThey were this big New York band\nthat were crap basically. Everyone\ntried to put on their American\naccents, they were really proud of\nthem. It was really false\u2014fair\nenough, if you come from America\nyou've gotta have an American\naccent but they went too far.\nWhen you 're on stage, and you 're being\npretty energetic do you ever smash stuff\nthat you latex wish you hadn't?No, never, 'cos if you regret things\nlike that you might as well pack up\nthere and then. It depends how we\nfeel on the night. Maybe we'll\ndecide not to do that. It's a feeling.\nAt the moment we're quite young,\narrogant and so frustrated with all\nthis shit around us that's what we\ndo it for.\nDoes if get expensive?\nYeah.\nSo what are you living on at the\nmoment?\nAbsolutely nothing.\nWe don't live.\nLee: They stopped us getting dole\nthe other week. That's why I 've\nbeen wearing this shirt for the last\nthree weeks. We're really poor at\nthe moment\u2014we got chucked off\nthe dole. Trying to get back on the\ndole you have to make up loads of\npathetic excuses, like you wanna be\na journalist or something. They\ndon't wanna know if you're in a band. They can't believe that there's someone sitting opposite them at\nIb ii hIIu ihI Page 8 FELIX April 28 1989\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews\nThe Dead Pool\nSan Francisco's finest, Inspector\nHarry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) is\nback on the streets, fighting the\ncancer of crime with the aid of his\nSmith and Wesson Model 29, and\nnew deeper voice.\nHis latest success story is the\nincarnation of crime lord Lou Janero\non a murder charge. This however\nmakes him a target for the mob's hit\nmen. The media circus surrounds\nHarry, but he just wants to get on\nwith his job.\nAcross the city another lousy\nblood and guts movie is in production. Director Peter Swan\n(Liam Neeson) plays a macabre\nmeeting, held in a sixty-foot cylinder\nblock, wherein Maria sings You are\nthe Light and shows Neil Kinnock\nhow to do his job properly.\nMeanwhile, George has seen the\nupper-world and is confounded by\nthe majesty of it all. Like leaving\nImperial to wander around Chelsea\nawhile.\nBut greater plans are afoot as\nFreeman exploits the help of\nscientist Warner (Jonathan Adams)\nand replaces Maria with the robot\nFutura. Will the hopes of the\nun cherished be dashed? Or can\nSteven save Maria, the people, and\nput and end to Thatcher's Britain?\nWell, what do you think?\nThe combination of twisting,\nswinging, sliding sets, from the\nPater Noster machine, the control\ncentre and the science lab, to the\ntravelling tubes which ferry the cast\non and off-stage throughout,\nprovide enough complex kinetics to\nmake Metropolis a visionary masterpiece.\nThe singing too is good, especially\nBlessed's thumping baritone which\nbrings life and sparkle to the stage.\nUnfortunately he is scarcely to be\nseen, scarcer heard, and there\nresults a vacuum in the set.\nBeyond this there remain two\nfaults. The songs, with one or two\nexceptions, are bland and unmemorable, and often\npunctuated by an irritating siren.\nThe motion of the set does not\novercome the generally static cast,\nand there are none of the essential\ndance routines symbolising such\nmusical competition as Cats or\nStarlight Express. The occasionally\nprolonged choreography was a gust\nof fresh air in an otherwise stale\ncollection of insipid atmospheric s. All I can conclude is that there are\nbetter was y of spending \u00a33 million,\nand for that matter, \u00a38.50.\nAndrew Clarke.\ngame with members of his crew,\ncalled the Dead Pool. Each draws up\na list of celebrities least likely to\nsurvive the year, and the winner is\nthe one with the greatest mortality\ncount. When his junkie rock star\nlead, Johnny Squares, buys it with\na mouth full of synthetic heroin,\npolice attention focuses on Swan.\nLater, the dead pool list comes to\nlight, Johnny Squares is on it and\nsuspicions are aroused. Two more\nmurders pin the blame squarely on\nSwan, but Callahan has other ideas.\nHe is also mixed up in a developing\nrelationship with TV news\nanchorwoman Samantha Walker\n(Patricia Clarkson) and still getting\nshot at by The Family. And all he\nwants to do is solve the case.\nEventually he does just that, as\nyou know he must. Along the way\nthe audience is treated to a profusion of death and violence,\ninterlaced with a sub-plot exploring\nthe effects and aspects of its media\ncoverage. 'You're just interested in\nblood and death' says Harry to\nSamantha, but when she is making\nthe news her attitudes change.\nThis inspection is paralleled in the\nfilms made by Swan. 'People are\nfascinated by death and violence.\nThat's why my films are successful.'\nStrange that Eastwood should\nhighlight such a sick audience\ndemean our, for if it did not exist he\nwouldn't be as popular as' he is.\nArnold Schwarzenegger's The\nRunning Man was guilty of the same\nhypocrisy.\nStill, a little mur d rous intent never\nhurt anyone. The Dead Pool is exactly\nwhat you would expect from Clint\nEastwood. His' acting style is as\nconsistent as ever, his few carefully\nchosen words providing the\nsarcasm and wisecracks that he is\nknown for. He even gains a new\ncatch-phrase, 'You're shit out of\nluck'.\nThe novel car chase, strong acting\nand direction, and impressive\ncinematography do not stop this\nbeing just another thriller. But to\nquote Peter Swan, 'Clint Eastwood\nsells tickets. You know, bums on\nseats, love.'\nAndrew Clarke.\n7 said Egg Fried Rice, punk!'\nIndigo\nAlmeida Theatre, Islington\nThe late 18th century. The port of\nLiverpool mono poli sing nearly one\nthird of the entire European slave\nmarket. Two young men, sons of\npowerful fathers, caught up against\nthis violent backdrop. Disease\nreigns:\nIndigo is a new play, billed as\n'savagely poetic drama about\npossession and betrayal. Written by\na woman with talent, performed by\na good, sometimes excellent, cast,\nwell staged, with impressive music'\nSomehow, I think, it ought to have\nbeen a lot better.\nWilliam Randell, a kind of\nsubdued Rik Mayall character, is\nsent to command his father's slave\nship. Ide the African Prince, his\nlanguage dense with imagery and\nmetaphor, so annoys his father, the\nking, that he is led to be sold at the\nmarketplace. Astonished, and then\ndisillusioned, at the death of a loyal\nfriend, Ide refuses to eat, thus killing\nhimself and, at the same time,\ncommanding William's obsessive\nadmiration. William attempts to\ncome to terms with the death by\nbedding Ide's woman...\nThe drama should build up to\nsome climax of energy and passion.\nInstead it is rather patchy, the play\nbeing most gripping, and best\nperformed in the mid stages, where\naction overrides the flowery script,\nand some acting is superb. The\nstage, sloping down towards the\naudience, seems menacing in its\nguise as hefty slave ship and anticipated meeting between the\ntwo main characters occurs with a flash and hiss of the hot branding\niron. But then act ict fi wanes, the\npace slows and the language\nthickens once more.\nNot completely natural, but\nneither far enough gone to be called\nstylised, the writer's technique\nseems tentative, trying too much to\nbe all-embracing, which ultimately\nloses effect. I want a tighter, more\ncontrolled approach.\nThere are a great many ideas in\nthis play. Sadly, this is a problem.\nJust as we grasp one thread another\ncrosses over it, helped by very dense\npoetic language. The result is a tangle. Meaning is lost as the (very\nable) cast spew out rich dialogue,\nhints in the plot are too plentiful and\nnot always followed up. Themes\nwhich could be developed into a worthwhile whole are given five\nminutes airing only (the concept of\n'home', colour of skin, corruption\nof ideals, possessive instincts and\nmany more: all touched upon, but\nnever explored or opened up). The\nplay is too long. There is too much\nin it.\nAl tough not an unqualified\nsuccess itself, Indigo has many\nhappy moments, and shows the\npromise of talents still to come into\nfruition. A nice try, with a provocative glimpse into the future.\nSusan Applebi/.\nApril 28 1989 FELIX Page 7\n\n"
