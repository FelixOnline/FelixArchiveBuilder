Rubber\nshark, rubber balls, readers' wives, Damien\nHirst, sheep in a tank, your confessions won't be\nheard. \"Isn't it the age of Aquarius?\", an\nastrologer enquired.\nIt's more like the age of Banality, one would\nlike to reply. Nobody cares about the Art any\nmore, they just want to eat the free ice cream.\nWould you blame them? We've passed the point\nwhen 'Is It Art?' is a question, for art is no more.\nThe fine line between Artist and Charlatan has\nfinally been erased and your two minutes of\nquestions are over. We are in a world where\nthere is so little to worry about that people need\ncounsellors to create problems for them, a world\nwhere life is but a string of equally irrelevant\nepisodes in a bland pastiche environment. Sleep,\nwatch TV, eat frozen Lasagne with your\ndysfunctional two-up two-point-four down\nfamily in a plastic box. Maybe Fred West had\nthe right idea - kill them all, wake them up,\nmake their lives real for one momentary break in\nthe cling film wrapped monotony of their\nemotions.\nAm I making myself clear? Do I need to?\nArtists don't, they just shove a dead animal in a tank of formaldehyde and sell it to an\nAdvertising magnate. In a museum it would be\nan exhibit but in a gallery it's Art; in a gallery\nyou can sell it for \u00a325,000.\nThe only artistic thing about the new\nexhibition in the Serpentine Gallery is the very\nabsurdity of it existing at all. According to the\nwords, these people try to 'uncover intimate\ndetails of an individual's private world' - they\nquestion existence and 20th century life. They\n'Away From The Flock' by Damien Hirst, 1994\nforgot how dull it really is. People live this every\nday, they watch it on TV, they know what's going on. They don't need some over trendy\nporn ophile shoving it back in their face in the\nmost obscure manner possible. OK, make a statement, say something, but make it a worthwhile point and say it properly. Don't expect people to reel in amazement at the\nprofundity of a rubber shark, don't expect people\nto congratulate you on your skill at smearing\npaint over old pornographic magazines. It's not\nbig and it's not clever and worse still it's not.\neven very well executed. So my viewers, for\nonce in your life don't bother. Go home, watch\nEastEnders, don't go near the Serpentine. You\nwon't even be given any free ice cream.\nMA\nWork on the themes of fear, loss, hope, death\nand fantasy by 15 international artists curate d by Damien Hirst.

The\nteam will be one of 16 competing\nfor the record at Duxford Open Air\nMuseum, near Cambridge. The\nevent is being organised by the\nImperial Cancer Research Fund and\nis receiving coverage by the national\nmedia including BBC Television's 'Record Breakers'.\nIt is also hoped that the world\nrecord for the largest paper aeroplane to fly 50ft will be set. The\nfavourites to do this are the team\nfrom British Petroleum, whose\nplane has a32ft wing-span and has\nalready flown over 50ft in tests.\nSean Trinner, the event organiser,\nsaid that the design weighed 171bs and had taken \"700 man hours, 300\nsquare metres of paper and 60 tubes\nof U HU glue.\" The record is currently held by NASA with a plane\nof wing-span 30'/2ft. Mr Trinner estimated that the\nevent would raise around \u00a310,000\nfor the charity.\nApology\nFelix would like to apologise to\nJames Handley, IC Radio Station\nManager, for misquoting him in\nissue 997.\nThe story related to an incident\ninvolving Union President Andrew\nWensley which took place in IC\nRadio on Tuesday 3rd May. We\naccept that the quote describing his\nstate was taken out of the context in\nwhich it was intended. Mr Handley\nreferred only to the way Mr Wensley\nlooked and not his actual state.\nWe would also like to apologise\nto Mr Wensley for portraying him\nin this way.\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nThe British Medical Association\n( BM A) has condemned medical\nschools for banning students who are\ncarriers of Hepatitis B. The ban came into force after new\nguidelines were issued last month by\nthe Committee of Vice-Chancellors\nand Principals (CVCP). The guidelines call for universities to screen all\napplicants for medical and dental\ncourses for Hepatitis B. Any student\nfound to be infectious and carrying\nthe virus should be excluded from the\ncourses, given advice on the career\nimplications and transferred to other\ncourses. St Mary's Hospital Medical\nSchool operates its admissions procedure in line with the guidelines. The\nofficial policy is stated in the new\nprospectus under the Health Section.\nThe Hepatitis B virus, like the\nAIDS virus, is present in the blood\nand body fluids of infected people. It\ncan be spread sexually, by sharing\nneedles, or by blood to blood contact.\nPeople infected may have no sym p toms, but many can develop serious\nliver disease, causing their death.\nDoctors who are infected cannot perform surgery because of the risk of\ninfecting a patient, but are unlikely to\nbe banned from other forms of non-invasive medicine.\nThe CVCP said: \"Medical schools\nare mindful of their overriding duty\nof care to the public with whom medical students come into close contact\nat an early stage of their studies...\nmedical and dental students have an\nethical duty to protect patients.\"\nThe BM A has labelled the measures as \"an alarmist and dogmatic\napproach to a problem which is well\nenough researched to be dealt with by\nreasonable management. It represents\nan overzealous approach by those\nresponsible for protecting the public\nand could prove difficult to defend\nlegally.\"\nThe Association expressed concern at discrimination against\npotential students without consideration of their individual situations.\nIt said that it is perfectly possible\nfor carriers of Hepatitis B to study\nfor a degree in medicine, although it\naccepted that they might have to be\nbarred from certain areas of medical\npractice.\n\u2022 FRESH HAIR SALON \u2022\nthe best student offer in london!

    "content": "Reviews 11\nMill On The Floss\nIt is the early nineteenth century. A woman is a witch if she swims, but if she drowns she dies.\nMaggie cries out in disbelief at what she reads.\nIn the background, screams can be heard of an\ninnocent woman drowning.\nThe dramatic start of the play grips you by\nthe neck and forces you to watch and listen. The\nplay is a successful attempt to adapt the book by\nGeorge Eliot and is about the life of a strong,\nintelligent, and imaginative woman. She has to\nhide her emotions and beliefs during the course\nof her life and, unfortunately, in an environment\nwhich is totally male dominated. She learns the\nlesson in harsh circumstances, severing her\nrelationship with her brother and also those\naround her. The play took us on a ride of\nemotions leaving us totally drained at the end of\nthe play.\nThe production team includes a small but\nvery impressive cast who led totally convincing\nroles (unfortunately they had a lack of actresses\nin one scene and had to use a stuffed doll\ninstead: don't worry, the human does appear\nlater). I must mention Shirley Henderson's delightful portrayal of the young and playful\nMaggie, who had a part which could have been\ndisastrous if not acted as well as she did and also\nMichael Matus who did a very good job as\nPhilip Wakeham: a crippled scholar.\nAlthough I did find various parts of the play\nvery amusing, I found that sometimes the\nhumour was in the middle of vital moments,\nwhich required absolute attention and no wit.\nUsing three Maggies to show her different\ncharacters as she grew was very effective, but I believed that it was inevitable to compare the\nperformances of the actes ses: the first Maggie's youthfulness and the third Maggie's forbidden\nsensuous affair with her best friend's lover\nseemed to overpower the role of the second\nMaggie. The play was very dramatic and passed\nbefore our eyes at a very fast pace, this meant\nthat the issues, which I thought would be dealt\nwith very deeply were, I believe, only just hinted\nat. However, these are petty criticisms compared\nto the full effect of the play which combines an\nunusual set, music, lighting and wondrous acting.\nThis is a heart-wrenching play and one to see\nif not just for the capturing performances by\nmost of the cast. Intriguing and unmissable. Go\nand see it.\nJack and Lianna\nTricycle Theatre, 269 Kilburn High Road. 071\n328 1000. Tube: Kilburn Station. Tickets: \u00a37\u00a311.50. Runs until 11th June.\n111!\nRough Justice\nJames Highwood (played by Martin Shaw of\nThe Professionals and The Chief) finds himself\nin the dock for his supposed act of mercy in\nkilling his nine-month old brain-damaged son.\nRejecting the help from a defence lawyer, he\nstands alone against a catholic, pro-life Q.C. Margaret Casely. As the plot unfolds Rough\nJustice becomes a trial of moral issues touching\nsubjects such as euthanasia and human rights.\nThroughout the performance the only actor\nwith any presence on stage was Shaw, the other\ncharacters seemed very unnatural in comparison.\nThe only exception being Highwood's lawyer,\nwho added a touch of humour to what was a very serious play.\nThe first half of the play, lasting one and a half hours, needed a large consumption of\nPro-Plus tablets to keep your interest. However,\nthe plot finally came together in the second half,\nwhere the audience was bombarded with what\nseemed like too much new evidence, which was\nnot properly introduced earlier on in the play.\nAt the end, the whole play left you questioning the British justice system.\nTop Cat & Petal\nAppollo Shaftesbury, Shaftesbury Ave. 071 494\n5070. Tube: Piccadilly Circus. Runs until 2nd July. Tickets: \u00a36.50-\u00a318.50 (cones \u00a38.50).

    "content": "Opinion 15\nDestructive Criticism\nFreedom &\nEquality\nDear Beccy,\nI was surprised at the replies to my letter\nconcerning the Satanic Verses. The points raised\nabout condoning murder clearly had no\nrelevance to the substance of my letter and I therefore feel obliged to reiterate my remarks in\na more easily comprehensible form.\nThere is no doubt that freedom is an\nextremely valuable and worthy thing, but it has\nbounds. The freedom to insult and abuse is not a legitimate freedom. This is recognised in the\nBritish legal system, which prohibits scorn and\nslander against holy doctrines of Christianity\nand its respected figures. What is distressing is\nthe fact that such legal protection is not\navailable for any other religion. A person\ninsulting Jesus can be charged with 'blasphemy'\nand subsequently spend several years behind\nbars or face a heavy fine, but he would be free\nto utter the most indecent and most provocative\nremarks about Muhammad and his family, and\nmake a fortune out of it.\nThis represents a fundamental flaw in the\njudicial system of this country and needs to be\neradicated. It was not too long ago when\ndiscriminations on race and sex were common\npractice. Many years of struggle and\ncampaigning by activists helped to bring an end\nto these unfair laws. It is now time that\n'religious' discrimination was also eliminated\nfrom society. And if we, as the young\nintellectual elite of the country, do not strive for\nequality and justice, who will?\nYours faithfully,\nYasser Hatami, EE2\nCAREERS INFORMATION\nVacancies.

Please note that the lunch time Duty\nPeriods will restart in the Autumn Term.\nDear Beccy,\nI really thought that after the last but one\nissue of the Beccy Land Self-Promotion Society\nnewsletter (oops, I mean Felix - an easy mistake\nto make), we would be spared the silly attacks\non Andy Wensley for at least a couple of weeks.\nIt was a lot to hope for, and lo and behold, there\nit was on the front cover. This was by far the\nmost childish attack in a long line and is a clear\nabuse of the position of Editor. As you yourself\nsaid, 'very responsible behaviour'.\nFor one who made more out of the seemingly\nobscure procedural r angling s over the new\nConstitution than the Sun makes out the Royal\nFamily, I suppose the alleged incident in issue\n997 ('Reckless Behaviour By ICU President')\nwas a gift. I can vividly recall the shock\nexperienced by myself and others as we read\nthat the President of ICU drinks. Who would\nbelieve it? Today a few whiskies, tomorrow\nsacrificing animals and virgins in Beit Quad.\nThe issue here, of course, is not whether or not\nthe event occurred. It clearly did, although the\ndetails are open to debate. The point is whether\nFelix should waste half a page on its coverage\nwhen only one and a half pages out of twenty\ncover news in what is supposed to be a student\nnewspaper. You get more news in the Exchange\nSilence Please\nDear Beccy,\nConcerning the IC Rag Fete. On behalf of the\nJazz and Rock Society, I would like to apologise\nto the visiting rock band 'Nancy Reverb' from\nthe Cystic Fibrosis trust. Unfortunately, due to\nthe selfish arrogance of certain high ranking\ncollege officials, the band travelled 80 miles to\nplay for five minutes on the Queen's Lawn.\nThey were then ordered to stop because of\n\"intolerable noise levels\". I find it appalling that\nthe hard work (and money) put in by the C.F. Trust went to waste because some faceless\nbureaucrat needs absolute silence to shuffle\npapers around his desk.\nYours bitterly,\nDerek Hummerston, Jazz and Rock Society.\n& Mart than this. To be quite honest, who gives\na toss if the Union President has a drink or two.\nAs far as I can gather, IC Radio was not\n'trashed' and no-one got hurt. This is not to\ncondemn or condone, but to read between the\nlines and find the real motives behind the story.\nThe Editorial is even worse. As well as being\nvacuous and quite possibly actionable, it is\nsanctimonious in the extreme. Since when was it\nthe job of Felix to set the moral standards of IC?\nIt is about time this sniping stopped and you\nreturned to the job of running Felix for the good\nof the students who elected you to the position.\nNothing has been done over the course of the\nyear to address the numerous complaints about\nthe plunging quality of Felix. Can you really\njustify spending so much time and effort on your\nobvious dislike of the President and the way he\ndoes his job at a time when large sections of\nCollege are constantly questioning your own\nability? A case of Dear Pot, Yours Kettle, I think\nyou'll agree.\nYours sincerely,\nSimon Baker, Chem IP.S. In keeping with new Felix policy, my next\nletter will be submitted with 5000 copies and a box full of Pritt Sticks.\nSMALL ADS Playgroups and Holiday Playschemes.\nThe Imperial College Day Nursery (8/9 Princes\nGardens) has started a play group for 3-5 years\nold on Wed and Thu, 9.15am12.30 pm. Cost per\nsession: \u00a35.50 students; \u00a36.50 staff.\nWe are also running a holiday play scheme for 5-9 years old for half term (31st May to 3rd June).\nSummer holiday play scheme18 th July to 9th Sept. \u00a38 per session 9.30a ml pm,2 pm5.30 pm or all day. Bring packed lunch and/or tea.\nFor more info, call Sue Thornett on 3356.\nMake Friends in Eastern Europe!\nAre you interested in contacting students in\nPoland, for example? If so, write your name,\naddress, date of birth, studies, interests and\nfuture plans and hand into the Union Office, 1 st\nfloor, Union Building.\nReplyfrom the News Editor:\nFirst of all, I would like to set the record straight\nabout Felix's coverage of the \"obscure\nprocedural r angling s\"( sic) concerning the\nConstitution.\nThe Union's constitution provides a legal\nframework for Union officers to work within.\nFor it to operate, the College Governing Body\nmust approve it. The fact is that Mr Wensley\nmisled the whole student body by declaring that\nthe new constitution had been approved by the\nGoverning Body as a working document. The\ndocument had not even been put to a Governing\nBody meeting. In comparison to the\nGovernment, most MPs who have lied to the\nHouse of Commons have been forced to resign.\nSecondly, Felix would have reported on the\nincident at IC Radio regardless of who was\ninvolved. Despite the fact that the Radio Station\nwas not damaged, the way in which Mr\nWensley was behaving (witnessed by several\npeople) ou ld have led to a very serious incident.\nThe fact that it was the Union President who\nwas involved only served to make the story\nmore newsworthy. Since the President is the\nfigurehead of the Union and is the primary link\nbetween students and College, it can do his\nrelations with the students and College no good\nif he publicly behaves in an irresponsible way.\nStudents have a right to know what is going\non in the Union and the College, and it is Felix\npolicy to try and keep them informed.\nThe deadline for letters is 5pm, Monday\n\n"

    "content": "12 Reviews\nMutha's Day Out, Terrorvision\nArkansaw, USA may be best known for giving\nus (allegedly) over-sexed Presidents but that's all about to change c oz Mutha's Day Out are the\nnext big thing (apparently!). Well, they've\ncertainly got the energy and enthusiasm, but\nconsidering half of them aren't even old enough\nto vote for the aforementioned President, you'd be worried if they didn't. Still, with some fine\ntuning to their brand of grunge/grind/rap/metal'\n(sic), who knows? When their mummy next lets\nthem out the results could be explosive.\nExplosive is probably not a very apt\ndescription of Terrorvision's set, but then to call\nit merely entertaining would be to do it a gross\ndisservice. They've got something for everyone,\nwhether it be in the semi rap-metal blast of 'My\nHouse', the kitsch Showaddywaddy-isms of\n'Oblivion', or the all-out dance floor attack of\n'Discotheque Wreck'. Heck, they even had a mini-orchestra come out in the encore, a move\nthat led singer Tony Wright to warn: \"Beware of\ndod gy rock bands, c oz let's face it, you won't see anything much dod gier than this!\"\nWith songs that keep reaching new levels of\npop-st as y and such self-effacing humour, do you\nhave any choice but to love 'em? I think the\n1,500 odd grinning faces that left the Astoria\nprobably answers that one. Vik\nWalkabouts\nSetting the Woods on Fire\nJust looking through the liner notes, you get the\ntone of this album. Black and white broken\nwindows, rusting wheels and cold desolate hills\nmirror a grey and doomed storyline. Its\ncharacters seem to inhabit, however transient ly, the rural twilight zone marooned by dying forests.\n'Bordertown' is deep within that empty\nterritory. The tale of an accident occurring in the\nwhite of your eyes and redness of her dress. And\nthe way it's phrased and played, the outcome is\ncloser to a metallic edge of a runaway hay baile r than a pair of warm lips.\nThere's more strangeness involved. Stuff\nabout lighting fires under yourself, letting blood\nflow clear and an old man buried in his wedding\nclothes. It isn't nice or reality. This wouldn't matter except that the Walkabouts don't play nice\neither. Somewhere on the folk side underbelly of\nrock, this one has a raw streak. Only the bar\nroom crawl of 'Old Crow Lied' and the horn\ninspired 'Hole in the Mountain' escape from the\npallid atmosphere. If there's burning to be done,\nbest get some dry tinder. (5) Tintin\nTom Robinson\nLove Over Rage\nFrom young gay to glad to be a dad. Pop's revolutionary fist is now manicured hand in\nglove as Tom Robinson undergoes his own\npersonal turnaround. So what and good luck to\nhim. He is still one of our finest lyricists and I can't see this album disappointing anybody\nexcept maybe the old Danny Kustow school of\nair guitarists. Mark Amble's back on keyboards\nbut with Chris 'smooth smooth' Rea guesting on\nguitar, the listener senses some kind of musical\nsplit going on here. Come back Danny.\nClosest to the old spirit has to be 'Green'. A good pole at the advertising moguls. \"Even\nRonald MacDonald's got a brand new bag, and\nif he gives a sh*t about the ozone layer, I 'll eat\n50 veggie burgers medium rare.\" No dilution\nthere but as far as protest songs go, it's the\nnearest we get. I miss the old stuff but this is\nalright. I give it 2...4...OK, 6 out of 10. T. Bat\nBlessed Ethel - '2 Minute Mind/Horsefly': On\n'2 Minute Mind', the singer's voice recalls\nDebbie (rather then Deborah) Harry but the\nguitar sound is far more '90s than '80s. Single\nof the week. Ridley Dash\nFun-da-mental - 'Dog-Tribe': The new line-up\ndeals out more hard hip-hop with bhangra-style\nsamples underlying the fiercely anti-racist\nlyrics. The \"we know where you live\" phone\nmessage that starts the 'Collusion Dub Dog'\nmix, left on the Youth Against Racism\nan s a phone, justifies everything this band stand\nfor. Ridley Dash\nLemon heads - 'Big Gay Heart': A timely\nrelease with its usual interesting compliment of\nsongs from the archives. The Pear\nthree walls down - 'Steps': Hmmm...jan gly, Byrdsy, summery, folk y, happy. And why not?\nThe two other songs here are very reminiscent\nof REM circa 'Life's Rich Pagent', which is of\ncourse the best LP ever made, so this is OK by\nme. Guy\nWorld of Leather - 'Silver': According to\nvocalist Mark Chase: \"Silver is the colour of my\ntrue love's ears\". Funny that, considering it's actually about his lost alsatian. The song itself is\na strange breed as it scampers through s le az oid guitar riffs into a warped disturbed and\nthoroughly mongrel-like chorus. Vik\nHeliopolis - 'Kintamani': Heliopolis were\noriginal members of Transglobal Underground,\nbut contrary to T GU they don't use live\nmusicians. Instead they rely purely on electronic\nbeats to create their hypnotic soundscapes.\nExcellent stuff. Mr Happy\nKindred Spirit - 'Ask Me No Questions': Catch\nthe return of a solitary Bangle with a River City\nPerson; Debbi Peterson and Siobhan Maher\nteam up and un surprisingly sound like jig gly jag gly acoustic pop music. Tintin\nUrban South - 'Whatever's Clever': This is a debut release from a Birmingham based rap\ncrew. The ep itself is full of clever lyrics on top\nof a mixture of cool hip hop beats and heavy\nbass. Mr Happy\nThe Family Cat - 'Wonderful Excuse': This is\nthe kind of single you'd be quite happy to bring\nhome to meet your parents but, for those of you\nwho want music, you can elope to the Bahamas\nwith, seek elsewhere. Joe\nSaint Etienne - 'Like a Motorway': A nifty\nhook (no doubt taking the fast lane to BBC sports montage city), is done no favours by\n'girl ie' vocals that are as pointless as they are\nbreathless. Rahul\nSpinanes - 'Noel, Jonah and Me': Cleverly\nselecting the least adventurous song from last\nyear's patchy but interesting 'Manos' LP, the\nSpinanes surge back in a rock-remix style which\nis at best inoffensive and at worst incredibly\ndull. Even Rebecca's once gorgeous voice is\nrendered flat and ordinary by the pedestrian\nproduction. Guy\nMachinery Hall - 'Herd': A slow downwards\nstair chord progression takes 'Herd' into action.\nThere's some minor melodic action but this\nends up aw hinging moan. Tintin\n\"...been laying low my get up and go...\"\n\n"

    "content": "14 Opinion\nEditorial\nRegarding Simon Baker's letter entitled\n'Destructive Criticism', I must explain that the\nother names listed at the bottom of the letter\nwhen it was submitted could not be printed, as\nthey did not verify their authorship, as is Felix\npolicy. But onto the content of the letter itself.\nI don't really understand where you get the\nBeccy Land Self-Promotion Society newsletter\nidea from. I do absolutely nothing to promote\nmyself in Felix. I am doing my job which is\nediting the magazine. I don not gratuitously fill\nthe pages with articles that I have written, nor do\nI put my name in the credits. The only place my\nname gets mentioned is under the imprint on the\nback page. How this promotes myself I really\ndon't know.\nThe letter goes on to question the place of\n'silly attacks on Andy Wensley'. The news\nstories are justified by the news editor on the\nopposite page. As for the front cover, the\nintention was a light-hearted joke which would\nmake people smile and, from what I saw, it did.\nIs there really any harm in this? Andy Wensley\nis the most public figure in the Union and should\nexpect to be in the spotlight. If he isn't doing his\njob (and there are a fair number of people who'd say he hasn't), he should expect criticism.\nAt the start of the year I deliberately did not\nwant a great deal of emphasis on what the\nPresident was doing wrong as I thought it would\nbe detrimental to the Union, putting it in a bad\nlight. I wanted to give Andy time to settle in and\nsort himself out, but the mistakes persisted and if\nanything, they got worse. Remember the\nproblems with the sabbatical elections? The non-secret secret ballot, the lack of publicity for new\nelection, not conducting the hustings properly.\nHe knew he'd screwed it up; why else would he\ninsist on turning off the tape recorder when\nbeing interviewed about it.\nAs to whether there should be more news,\nFelix is a newspaper only in name. I decided at\nthe start of the year that I wanted Felix to have\nmore of a magazine format. This would mean\nless emphasis on the news and more on features\nand articles. I was elected by the student body to\nRag Fete Thanks\nDear Beccy,\nWe would just like to say a big thank you to\neverybody who helped at Rag Fete '94,\nespecially those who were good enough sports\nto sit in the stocks. Special thanks go to I.C.

If anyone\nwould like to see them again they are playing the\nPowerhaus on Monday (23rd) at 1 l pm, cost \u00a33.\nThanks also to every one who came to Rag\nFete and those who also were at the dinner.\nNext years slogan is Muff Dive '95 and the\nnominated charities are Imperial Cancer\nResearch Fund, The Rainforest Foundation,\nSense and Cystic Fibrosis.\nLots of love,\nJane & Helen, Rag Exec 93 - 94\nListen Carefully\nDear Beccy,\nI write to you as I am concerned about the\npeople of this land. Some look, but they do not\nsee, they listen but they do not hear and they\nread and yet do not comprehend.\nIn the last two issues of Felix (997 and 998),\nRobert Munro and Anthony France fail to\nunderstand what Yasser Hatami (996) is trying\nto say. He does not suggest that anyone should\nbe murdered or that terrorism should be\njustified, but merely that other religions and\nbeliefs should be honoured and respected. Mr\nFrance, if you have not yet noticed, we exist in a multi-cultural community where everyone lives\nin harmony; to abuse and provoke others is not\nwelcome here, not from you, Salman Rushdie or\nanyone else. If it is within our powers we must\nendeavour to prevent religious, racial or criminal\nupheaval. I am sure you agree and I just hope\nthat the Satanic Verses will be an example of\nthis for years to come.\nAnd as for you, Mr Munro, let me just say\nthat in this country we also have the freedom of\nspeech; if we do not abuse this right we may\nexpress our feelings and opinions. It is clearly\napparent that you have not read Mr Hatami's letter properly for it does not coincide with your\naccusations. I suggest you learn to swim before\njumping head-first into the deep end.\nOh, and Mr France, nothing would give me\ngreater pleasure than to insult your mother, but\nforgive me if I do not because of the reasons I have outlined above.\nYours faithfully,\nArash Jamali, Elec Eng I.P.S. Felix is great. Keep up the good work\nguys. I know I speak on behalf of all of IC, as\nnot many universities have their own paper.\nedit Felix as I saw fit and that is what I am\ndoing. The numerous complaints about the\nplunging quality of Felix do not seem to have\nreached me. Admittedly there have been some\nbut, as I have explained before, I can only put in\nFelix what students write. I also have to try to\ncater for all the students in the College. As for\nthe presentation, I hope this is an improvement\non the past, as it is something that I place a great\ndeal of importance on this.\nFinally, I can only assume that the policy of\n'5,000 copies and a box of pr it t sticks'\nmentioned at the bottom of the letter is a comment\non my request that articles and letters be\nsubmitted on disk. Let me explain the reason:\nWith many people having exams, they cannot\nspend as much time in Felix. It makes life a lot\neasier for everyone if time is saved by articles\ncoming in already typed.

    "content": "4 Feature\nThe Wordly Wise\nLast weekend, the Regional Finals of the Times Crossword Championship took\nplace in Knightsbridge. Simon Shaw tapped into some of the cerebral activity.\nLast Saturday, more than two\nhundred seemingly ordinary\npeople convened at the Hyatt\nCarlton Tower Hotel in\nKnightsbridge. They were there\nto take part in a competition, the\nTimes Crossword Championship.\nThere was a buzz of childish\nexcitement in the makeshift foyer\noutside the hotel's Ballroom\nWest as introductions took place.\nSizing up of the opposition was\nmasked by refined English smiles\nand casual nodding of heads.\nCryptic Crosswords test the\nmind in much the same way as\nany enigma does. They require\nsimultaneous systematic and\nlateral thinking.\nI watched and listened with\ninterest as the puzzlers warmed\nup their cerebra.\n\"I do them in numerical order.\nIt reduces the risk of missing a clue.\"\n\"I do them in a chain so that I have interlinking letters.\"\nEavesdropping on their\nconversations, you might have\nthought they were potty. Some\nwere.\nI had arrived early and took\nthe opportunity to walk round the room in which\nthe competitors were to solve their crosswords. It\nlooked a lot like an exam room - four crossword\ngrids were laid out on each table. The\ncompetitors were to be given half an hour to\nsolve each crossword.\nFinishing early resulted Eavesdropping on their comPilers in a bonus equal to the rr \u00b0 crossword\nconversations, you\ne qu; number of minutes left\nthe clock but\nThe Hyatt's Ballroom. Scene of the enigmatic interrogation\nman ambled out of the Ballroom wearing a navy\nblue Oriel College blazer and a now familiar\ncrossword competition tie. He turned out to be\nJohn Grant, former Deputy Editor of The Times\nand now, in retirement, their Crossword Editor. I inquired about the\nof the\nor ds. He was\ncagey. Compiling is a an cottage industry and\nincorrect solution meant might hO VC UlOUght they crossword setters are\nno score traditionally secretive.\nBefore the start I was Were pOtty. Some Were. What he could tell me\nintroduced to organiser, was that The Times has a Michael Rich. It is the 25th year and the 24th team of some ten compilers, two of whom were\nevent, he told me. This year's Championship is\nsponsored by Knockando, manufacturers of fine\nScotch whisky. Today's event was part of the\nregional finals for which qualifiers had to have\nsolved two Times crosswords. The second\nqualifying puzzle was an \"eli minato r\" which was\nnecessary to reduce the large number of entries\narising from the first qualifier. The Glasgow\nregional final has already taken place. The other\nregional finals will be held in Leeds,\nBirmingham and Bristol, later this year. The\nnational finals, for which the event returns to\nLondon, are held in September.\nAs I was talking to Mr Rich, a jolly-looking\nresponsible for this competition's crosswords.\nIt was time for the competition to begin. Mr\nRich welcomed everyone and his wisecracks\nwent some way to iron out\nthe frowns on the nervous\nfaces. He introduced John\nGrant as the man who\nwould settle any disputes\narising from the crossword\nclues. Mr Grant cordially\ninvited anyone who had a quandary with a clue to\ndiscuss it with him in the tearoom but warned\nthem jovially \"It is unlikely I will share your\nview.\n\"Three, two, one...go\". The\nsolvers turned over their clue\nsheets and began reading. About\nten minutes later the first arms\nwere being raised, each one\nsignifying the completion of a grid. The triumphant few swiftly\nretired to the tearoom where they\nexcitedly discussed the first\ncrossword. I began to hear\nrumours of a misprint in one of\nthe clues. Surely not. John Grant\nsat in a corner coolly meditating\nbehind a pile of scruffy reference\nbooks - Collins and Chambers\nDictionaries, the Oxford\nDictionary of Quotations, the\nCollins Dictionary of the Bible\nand Brewer's Twentieth Century\nDictionary of Phrase and Fable.\nThe rumour proved to be with\nfoundation: an anagram clue had\nthe word 'got' in place of 'get':\n7. We got confused with odd\ndouble entendre, for example\n(3-5)\nHowever, being an anagram\nclue, (TWO-EDGED) there was\nlittle reason for it having\nseriously put any solver off. Its relevance was\nrefuted by a, nevertheless, quietly perturbed John\nGrant. The general consensus was that the first\ncrossword had been pretty easy. I had been told\nas much and was anxious to see how the now\nrelaxed solvers would tackle the second one. The\ncompetitors shuffled back into the exam room.\nThis time, the first person to solve the\ncrossword had taken noticeably longer. However,\nin recognition of its difficulty he had praise for\nits compiler:\n\"Real artistry,\" he declared.\nA more harassed solver looked visibly shaken\nby the more difficult second puzzle.\n\"When one's not under pressure, one can do it\nin ten minutes,\" he insisted; this one had taken\nhim 17 minutes.\nAn honest solver said simply: \"That was a difficult puzzle.\"\nAll competitors\nlooked likely winners\non Fifteen to One.\nSome were.\nIt was 5 across which\nprovoked most of the\ndebate:\n5. Fly? One may have to\ndown under (6)\nThe answer was\nDOCTOR but its meaning as a type of angler's fly was not widely known even in these circles.\nThis week's Elimination can be found on the back page\n\n"

    "content": "President\nImperial College Union 13\nDeputy President\n(Clubs & Societies)\nTraining and Development. Currently, the\nUnion does not train its student officers to an\nadequate level. This training should include\nproviding sufficient background information\nabout the Union, the College, the University of\nLondon and issues and problems the Officer\nmay face in the course of their post.\nWe are working towards providing training\nfor all Union Officers. This includes a manual\nof background information, general training, a networking event and specific job-related\ntraining. Most of this will be provided in the\nform of a two-day residential training event.\nFunding for this has been secured.\nCurrently, potential trainers are being\ncontacted and the brief for the event is being\nprepared. It is intended that this will be the start\nof an ongoing scheme of development that will\nhelp Union Officers work more effectively.\nNext year's office sabbaticals are currently\nmeeting their counterparts this year on regular\nweekly basis. This helps to fill them in on\ndevelopments in College and further afield, all\npart of preparing them for their year in office.\nWe have begun a series of meetings to\ndiscuss how we can effectively plan from year\nto year. At present, there is an insufficient level\nof continuity. The meetings are looking into the\nstrengths and weaknesses of the Union and how\nwe can lay down strategic plans for the future.\nE Mail. At IC, we are lucky to have e mail.\nThis is being used more and more by students,\ndepartments and College. I am arranging for the\nUnion to be connected to the e mail system with\naccounts to be set up. Once completed, you\nwould be able to mail any part of the Union, be\nit a club, sabbatical, member of staff or Union\noutlet. This could mean lower administration\ncosts, a shorter response time on enquiries and\nan increased awareness of student activities.\nConstitution. Following on from last term, I met with College officials who are now satisfied\nwith the draft. This will be brought to today's meeting, (Friday 20th May) for its first approval.\nHandbook and Alternative Prospectus. The\nHandbook Editor has resigned after being\noffered a better summer job. At the time of\nwriting, a new candidate should have been\nfound. Advertising is being covered by Sam\nMichel (Events and Marketing Manager) with\nthe other tasks being done by sabbaticals. We\nare examining new formats and ways of\ndistributing the Handbooks. Anyone who is\ninterested in the project or feels they would like\nto contribute to our most important publication,\nplease get in contact through the Union Office.\nWe are running the election for Alternative\nProspectus Editor a term ahead of schedule due\nto the demand for copies. If we do not produce a new Alternative Prospectus, we would run out\nof copies shortly into the start of next term.\nA fair amount of time has been spent\npublic ising and finding candidates to take over\nother Union posts for next year. As a result,\nmost posts should be filled at today's meeting.\nClubs and Societies. In readiness for the next\nacademic year, I am collecting the necessary\ninformation and application forms. These relate\nto the Handbook, Freshers' Fair, Noticeboards\nand an end of year report on clubs and societies.\nSport. I have been involved with the interview\npanel for the post of Sports Centre Manager and\nI am pleased to announce that Colin Wilson has\nbeen appointed. Colin has been the acting\nmanager for the past six months.\nI have completed a survey of sports teams\nand clubs at Imperial. This information was\nrequested by both the Athletics Committee and\nthe Governing Body. It attempts to establish the\nlevel of involvement in each of the student clubs\nand societies.\nThe working party on sport will commence\nmeeting shortly and all the information I have\ngathered will form the basis of any arguments I put forward at this forum. The working party on\nsport has been formed to plan the sports\nBudgets. I have now received a probable figure\nfrom College for next year's sub vent ion. The\ngood news is that it is larger than this year's figure, but the bad news is that it would still\nleave us heading for a deficit next year of\n\u00a326,000 on the budget reached at the end of the\nlast UFC. Hopefully we will be able to sort this\nout at the next UFC.\nMinibus. By this UG M(I'm writing this a week\nin advance), the new minibus should have been\ndelivered, and will soon be available for clubs\nuse. Please don't damage it too much - it costs a fortune.\nTrading. There is little new news to bring up\nabout the trading outlets, although we are\ncurrently working on a number of plans for the\nfuture, which will need College approval.\nHopefully I will be in a position to bring you\nprovision at Imperial for the next decade.\nJazz & Rock Club Move. Due to the noise\nproblem of the Jazz and Rock practice room\nbeing beneath Beit Hall, it has finally closed.\nThe room is due to move back where it came\nfrom five years ago. This is the room currently\noccupied by Rag. Having found an acceptable\nalternative room for Rag, it was possible for\npermission to be given to Jazz & Rock to move\ninto this room. The room is the best suited in the\nbuilding for the noise upsetting the least people.\nStorage for Clubs and Societies. The problem\nof where to store equipment is a big one for\nclubs without a room of their own. The room\nfreed by Jazz and Rock will make ideal storage\nfor these clubs. The idea is still being developed,\nbut I hope by the start of the next academic year\nto have a new storage facility for our clubs and\nsocieties.\nmore information by the next U GM. By the time\nthis U GM happens, the new Rector will have\nbeen shown around the Bookstore as well as the\nrest of the Union.\nOther stuff. A number of items have been\napproved for spending from the old House fund\nby Executive, including air conditioning for the\nSTOIC technical room, to prevent all of the\nequipment from overheating. A project that I would like to see carried out is the refurbishment\nof the lift in the Union building, which is really\ngro tty. This would cost several thousand and I'm currently trying to work out where to get the\nmoney from. We are also looking to improve the\nstandard of a number of other areas of the\nbuilding, which would make it more pleasant for\nthe students and more attractive to external\nbookings.\nWomen - Have Your Say!\nThis Friday morning, a questionnaire, aimed at the female members of the college, will be laying\nout some strategic points. Please have a look them, as you might find there is something you\nwould like to say. Filled-out questionnaires should be sent to: Kristine Vaaler, Women's Officer,\nUnion Office. Thanks to all who participate.\nThe questionnaires can be picked up from:\n\u2022Union Office \u00abMech Eng Main Entrance \u00abRSM Main Entrance\n\u2022Maths Walkway *Elec Eng Main Entrance -Sherfield Security\n\u2022Physics Blackett Entrance 'Biology Common Room \u00abSilwood\n\u2022Aero & Chem Eng Main Entrance \u00abChem & BioChem Main Entrance\nDeputy President\n(Finance & Services)\nDon't forget the UGM today in the Ents Lounge at 1 pm\n\n"

    "content": "News\nArt Exhibition Mind Over Matter\nA visitor to the ante room becomes transfixed\nAn art exhibition containing work by students and staff of Imperial College\nopened this week.\nThe exhibition, which is in the Ante Room of the Sherfield Building,\nopened on Wednesday. It will run until 17th June and entrance is free.\nMany of the works are for sale, at prices negotiable with the artists.\nUCL Team Uncover\nAncient European\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\n500,000 year old human remains\nhave been unearthed by a team led\nby Dr Mark Roberts of University\nCollege London.\nA piece of left tibia (shin bone)\nwas discovered 100 feet below\nground amongst animal bones in a gravel pit in Boxgrove, Sussex.\nAlthough the piece of bone is only\naround 5in long, scientists have\nmanaged to construct a picture of\nthe size and build of the man. The\nearly human has been estimated as\nbeing 6ft3 in tall and probably\nweighed more than 13 stone.\nBoxgrove Man has been hailed\nas the earliest European and the\nfinding destroys theories that\nNeanderthal Man was the ancestor\nof modern man. The ancient human\nwas taller, stood more upright and\nhad a bigger brain than Neanderthal\nMan, who stood no more than 5ft7 in and had a broad stature. It is\nnow thought that Neanderthal Man\nwas an evolutionary dead-end.\nDr Geoffrey Wainwright, chief\narchaeologist for English Heritage,\nsaid Boxgrove Man \"was surrounded by stone tools and the remains of\nanimals, ranging in size from elephant\nand rhino to mink and voles.\" The\nearly water voles have provided\nvital dating evidence as they had\nroots on their molar teeth which\nwere absent in later breeds. This\nalong with oxygen-isotope and\npaleo magnetic techniques have provided the necessary information for\nreliably dating the specimen.\nThe remains have caused international interest among scientists\nwho have long suspected that the\nfirst European man predated previous finds. The discovery is likely to\nbe classified as \"archaic Homo\nsapiens\" and is millions of years\nlater than the earliest human ances-tors, Australopithecus, who lived\nbetween 1 and 3.75 million years\nago, and Homo erectus who flourished from 1.8 million years ago.\nBoth of these ancestors have been\nfound in Africa, only Homo sapiens\nis known to have entered Europe.\nBY WEI LEE\nQuestions which have puzzled\nphilosophers for thousands of years\nmay soon be answered at a seminar\nto be held at Imperial College on\n26th May.\nFuturists and science fiction\nwriters have dreamed of the day\nwhen computers and machines have\nthe ability to make decisions and\nthink on their own. The advent of\nneural networks and artificially\nintelligent machines are making\nthese dreams reality.\nOne of the guest speakers at the\nseminar, Igor Aleksander, Professor\nof Neural Systems Engineering at\nImperial College, says machines are\nnow being developed which can\nthink, hold their own point of view\nand even dream. The potential for\nthese systems is enormous, with\npossible applications in medicine,\ncommunication and security.\nThree other distinguished scientist, Prof Jean-Marie Lehn, Prof\nLord Porter and Prof Robert May\nFRS, will also be offering their\nviews on the future of scientific\ngains with the union of biological\nsciences and physical sciences.\nThe seminar, Is Life Becoming\nHard, will be held in the Clore\nLecture Theatre, Huxley Building,\nat 2pm next Thursday.\nPrincess Royal to\nvisit IC\nBY LYNN BRAVEY\nHRH The Princess Royal will officially open a new parallel computing\ncentre at Imperial College next\nTuesday.\nThe Imperial College/Fujitsu\nEuropean Parallel Research Centre\nwill support a programme of collaborative research in Europe into parallel software technology and a wide spectrum of applications.\nFujitsu has donated an AP1000 parallel machine to Imperial College to\nprovide the initial computational\nresource for the Centre. Many academic departments, including\nAeronautics, Chemistry and\nGeology, will use the machine to\ntackle problems which cannot be\nsolved by conventional machines.\nAn estimated \u00a360,000 has been\nspent on giving the foyer of the\nHuxley Building a face-lift for the\nroyal visit.\nMinibus Safety\nBY MIKE INGRAM\nUnion minibuses may be forced to\nhave seatbelts fitted if predicted\nlegislation on minibus safety goes\nahead.\nThis comes after a minibus crash\nthis week in which two 8-year old\nCub Scouts and the 42 year old driver died and over 30 people were\ninjured. The crash happened in\nheavy rain on the A59, when a minibus carrying the Cub Scouts\ncollided with a coach carrying\nteenage Army Cadets.\nThe deaths have brought renewed\ncalls for seatbelts to become compulsory in minibuses. As a result, the\nGovernment has pledged to make\nfitting seatbelts to new minibuses\ncompulsory. There have also been\npredictions that the law may force\nseatbelts to be fitted in all minibuses.\nIf this became law, the Union would\nhave to refit all of its current fleet of\nminibuses, which are mostly of the\n'crew' type where seats run along\nthe sides of the minibus.\nDeputy President (Finance &\nServices) David Goddard said that\nthe Union have been \"looking,\nalong with the Safety Department,\nat actually converting those [the\ncrew-type buses] to front facing\nseats with seatbelts.\" The discussion came after a Union-owned\nminibus was written off in an accident last summer. The new minibus\nbeing bought by the Union will be\nequipped with seatbelts.\nThe Times Crossword Competition is covered on pages 4 and 5\n\n"

    "content": "Reviews 7\nThe Draughtsman's Contract\nStarring: Anthony Higgins, Janet Suzman and\nAnne Louise Lambert\nDirector: Peter Greenaway\nPeter Greenaway, a name to curl the hearts of\nink be speckled critics and public alike. Even\nthese diverse groupings were united in their\ndisgust at his last film, The Baby of Macon.\nThe Draughtsman's Contract harks back to\nbetter days for Greenaway; it was his most\nsuccessful film when released in 1982. Now\nreissued in a new 35mm print, it lets those of us\nwho have more recently lashed ourselves to his\nwagon see a different side of his work.\nThe plot suffers the intrigues of 17th century\nEngland; a place of blooming gardens and blue\nskies, where men get to wear the best clothes\nand wigs. An arrogant and suave draughtsman is\nasked to make a series of drawings. Initially, he\nrefuses but such is the desperation of the patron\nthat finally a peculiar contract is signed. Twelve\ndrawings of the estate and the use of the lady of\nthe house for the draughtsman's pleasure.\nThe draughtsman begins his work. He\nrequires total control over his subject and\nanything which even inadvertently comes into\nthe field of view must remain there.\nHowever, like a Magrittian scene, strange\nthings start happening. A ladder appears, some\nclothes are strewn in trees and when the horse of\nthe master of the house (who is thought to be\naway on business) is found, foul play is\nFramed by his profession, the Draughtsman gets involved in contracts written in blood.\nsuspected. The draughtsman is accused by the\ndaughter of knowing too much about the\nmystery concerning her father. He allows\nhimself to be involved in another contract, this\ntime to be party to the daughter's pleasure.\nWhen finished, the objectiveness of the twelve\ndrawings displays the duplicity of the living.\nAs in all of his films, the cinematography is\nstunning in its finery. If the plot is occasionally\nforced in un reasoned directions then the film\nshows the broadness of the issues involved. This\nfilm is not one of his masterpieces, but in a world which bulges with sentiments becoming\nmore immediate or more drip py by the reel, it\nremains a pool of deep attraction.\nTintin\nOpens today. MGM Piccadilly \u00a36 (Half-price on\nMon, \u00a33.50 Tue-Fri before 6pm). pi 111\n111\nNaked Gun\nThe\nStarring: Leslie Nielsen, Priscilla Presley,\nFred Ward\nDirector: Peter Segal\nThe first one was rather drab. The second one,\nhowever, was a riot. The Final Insult falls\nsomewhere in between. The plot, what there is\nof it, concerns Lt Drebin's attempt to retire\nbecause his marriage to what s her breasts( played\nby Priscilla Presley) is on the rocks. He is called\naway from his housework, however, to investigate a terrorist, Fred Ward, who is trying to\nblow up the Oscars ceremony for no apparent\nreason.\nSome of the expected mickey-takes of other\nfilms are pretty good; it starts with a rip-off of\nthe staircase scene in The Untouchables, which\nis of course itself rip-off the famous 'Odessa\nSteps' sequence of Eisenstein's Battleship\n33^:\nFinal Insult\nPotemkin. The movie differs from the first two,\nin that there are far fewer background gags than\nusual and the jokes are really spread too thin,\neven with a running time of only 83 minutes.\nSome of the more regular humour,\nmeanwhile, falls a tad flat. The most obvious is\nDrebin's attempt to get into an infertility clinic\nby pretending to have a broken arm. This leads\nto predictable gags about 'bending' and\n'pulling', although the flashback 70s disco scene\nis quite funny.\nAlthough it's worth watching, I wouldn't rush out to see it and certainly wouldn't pay\nlarge sums of money. Recommended on video\nor, even better still, as a FilmSoc showing.\njk\nOpens today. MGM Trocadero \u00a37, (\u00a34 Mon, \u00a34\nTue-Fri before 6pm). UCI Whiteleys \u00a35.75\n(\u00a33.50 before 3pm). 'Haven'tI been here before ?' says Lt Drebin\nLook out for The Piano and Schindler's List at the ICU Cinema\n\n"
