Kate\nreceived counselling before she was\neven given the blood test at the STD\nclinic. 'They warned me about all\nthe down-sides to the test and all the\nup-sides too. They were really\nhonest. They told me that if I had\nthe test done and it was negative\nthen I wouldn't have to worry\nanymore. If I tested positive, then\nI could quickly get drugs and\ncounselling to help me get in control\nof things and maybe keep healthier\nfor longer. But the downsides were\nfrightening and I very nearly bottled\nout. I was warned about the\nprejudice and the disruption, and\nthe ignorance and hatred I may have\nto face if I was tested positive.\nBut the blok eI had been with had\nbeen tested positive and I had to\nknow. I couldn't live with the\nuncertainty. I had the test and I was\npositive.'\nKate is revising for her finals, but\nshe is remarkably calm about them.\n'Everything takes on a different\nperspective. I didn't want to chuck\nmy degree in. That would have\nbeen three years wasted and there\nhas been more than enough waste\nin my life already. You've just got\nto get on the best you can. It's the\nway I keep my sanity I suppose.'\nFor the same reasons that she\nremains anonymous for this\ninterview, Kate has also told only\nher closest friends and one of her\ntutors that she is HIV positive.\nT don't want to be treated like a leper. I'm used to having lots of\npeople around me. And there is no\nuse pretending that people, friends\nand such would be able to handle\nit. Some people's families can't even take it.\nI know about one mother whose\ndaughter is HIV positive too. Her\nmother makes her book into a Bed\nand Breakfast every time she has\nher period! I don't want that shit.\nI want to shake peoples' hands\nwithout seeing fear and hatred in\ntheir eyes. I demand that as my\nright as a human being.'\nWhen asked if she owes it to\nthose she knows to tell them that she\nis infected, she reacts\ncontemptuously.\nT don't owe them a damn thing!\nI'm not putting anyone in any\ndanger, and I will not give up my\nright to hold hands because of\nignorance and evil bigotry. HIV is\nnot skin deep. My skin holds the\nvirus in. Any one who touches me,\nwho shakes my hand, is completely\nsafe. My skin is their protection. It\nis also my prison.'\nKate refuses to talk about how she\ncontracted the illness.\n'That's my personal life, and it\nis private. But I want people to\nknow that I am heterosexual, and\n. I have never injected drugs in my\nlife. And I don't sleep around\neither. It was one mistake. God!\nDon'tI sound like an awful TV advert. But it's true. I didn't deserve this. No one deserves this\nno matter what they've done.'\nWhat do you think sex is for? Pure\nfun and enjoyment? A way of\ndemonstrating love? Strictly for the\nproduction of children? Something\nto laugh and brag about amongst\nfriends? Healthy exercise?,Dirty\nfun? Annoying the neighbours?\nTesting the bed springs? Passing the\n(permissiveness makes more\norgasms but we miss out on old-style restricted courtship, kisses and\nlooks that vagina-bent, with-it males\nnow think is sloppy); sleeping\ntogether without intercourse.\nIn fact HIV could provide a means of encouraging people to\nKate is one of the most\ncourageous people I have ever met.\nIt is a naive observation to make,\nbut nevertheless it is important that\nit be made. Kate does not look any\ndifferent to most people you would\nsit next to in a lecture theatre. HIV\nis a cruel and deceptive illness.\nThose who have it may not even\nknow it unless they have been tested\nor when it is too late, and they have\ncontracted full blown AIDS. It is a curse of our day and a curse that\nnobody deserves.\n'I'm doing this interview today\nonly for one reason. People must\nknow that it does happen around\nthem, very close to them. There is\njust no way of telling how many of\nyour own friends are carrying the\ninfection. After all if they are like\nme, they will not tell you. Don't be\nstupid and take risks. AIDS doesn't care if you are a student, a drug\naddict or a bank manager. Use safe\nsex and enjoy your life. It is such\na precious thing and we take it\ncompletely for granted.'\nWhat Kate claims as her right is\nanyone's sincere privilege. I am\nproud to shake this brave lady by\nthe hand.\nReproduced with the kind\npermission of the 'London Student'.\nSo what do you\nAIDS awareness week has been\norganised by Nicky Fox, Zoe'\nHellinger, Demi Jones, Ola\nOlulode, Stef Ruis and Donna\nSibley.\ntime before a cigarette?\nExperimenting with new positions?\nWhispering about behind the bike\nsheds? Playing with hamsters?\nLetting off steam? Quelling your\nurges? An overrated pastime?\nWhatever your personal views, we\ncan all agree that it should be a life-enhancing experience, not a potentially life-destroying one.\nNon-Penetrative Sex\nIf you attended sex education\nlessons at school the chances are the\nmain thrust of the course was\ntowards teaching about\nreproduction - how to do it and how\nto stop it - and therefore penetrative\nsex is promoted as 'the norm'. In\nfact after a straw poll asking\nstudents 'what type of sex would\nyou think of if I said I had sex last\nnight?', everyone answered\n'penetrative sex'. This need n't be\nthe case, there are many varied\nmethods of safer sex which are\ncommonly practised which don't involve penetration.\nSome other things are 'real sex'\ntoo which people also need for a fulfilling relationship. For example;\nbeing together in a situation of\npleasure, or of danger, or just of\nrest, touching, holding hands\nbroaden their sexual horizons, not\njust relying on penetration as the\ngoal of sexual pleasure. If you're\ninterested in research, Alex\nComfort's 'The Joy of Sex'\ndescribes many types of non-penetrative sex which are worth\ntrying - that should keep you going\nfor a short while!\nToys\nDon't forget that using toys can\nheighten sexual enjoyment and are\ntotally safe as long as you don't share them. For example; dildos,\nvibrators, Chinese balls, rubber\ndolls, artificial vaginas The list\ngoes on and on as does the pleasure.\nOral Sex\nOf slightly higher risk of infection\nis oral sex, the risk can be removed\nby using a condom or dental dam.\nDental dams are relatively rare in\nthis country but are available in\nsome local chemists, they are\nbasically a flavoured square of\nrubber and are used by placing over\nthe area to be licked. A very\ninteresting study on the art of oral\nsex for women can be found in\n'How to drive your man wild in\nbed' by Graham Masterton.\nSimilarly a study for men is found\n\u2014 1 0 \u2014\n\n"

We have a Union President\nwho behaves like a spoiled brat, a Union Store that has half full\nshelves for much of the time and is\nforever running out of basic items\nsuch as A4 paper, a snack bar in the\nJCR that is 20% more ex penes ive than local bakeries\u2014the list is\nendless.\nHowever, rather than the\nannoying but trivial, I would like to\nwrite about the life-threatening\u2014\nthe potential death-trap that is\nFisher Hall. In the event of a fire\nat night, it is my opinion that many\nof us would not get out. This will\nnot be because of poor access; on\nthe contrary, Fisher had ten main\nescape routes.

Whilst in no\nway fully endorsing Miss\nHellinger's( and others') actions, it\nappeals to me to see any group of\npeople willing to get up off their\nbacksides and stop the destruction\nof months of hard work.\nFar more predictable, however\nhas been the backlash from Felix,\nwho as usual have produced\nconceited, self-satisfied, editorial\ndr iv v le.

As you might\nhave already guessed, nothing had\nbeen done. I am sure that bodies\nsuch as the Health and Safety\nExecutive would take a dim view of\nsuch blatant disregard for safety by\nsenior management, so hopefully\nthis letter will produce a result.\nYours hopefully,\nCA France, Civ Eng I. Dear Adam,\nAt the union EG M on 6fh February, a motion concerning\nThird World Debt was narrowly\ndefeated. The motion called on the\nunion to stamp all cheques which it\nprocesses with the message 'Stamp\nOut Third World Debt Now!' and\nto send fax messages in protest to\nthe chairmen of the big four banks.\nNeither of these actions would\nrequire much time or expense and,\ngiven that the vote was so close and\nthat many people seemed confused\nby the issues, I feel I must write to\ndiscuss it.\nThe debt crisis began in the 1970s when western banks were flooded\nwith oil dollars following massive\nincreases in the price of oil. The\nbanks saw lending to Third World\ncountries as a safe way of reinvesting this money. Huge loans\nwere offered, often to despots and\nmilitary governments who had no\nManufactures, show them!\nChemical Engineering students,\nthose of Mechanical Engineering,\nCivil Engineering, Biology and all\nthe others, do you have all the\nequipment you dream of?

They were only\ninterested in buying armaments to\nmaintain their rule over the people.\nThe people of these countries saw\nno benefit from these loans and are\nnow burdened with an un payable debt.\nToday, the total amount owed is\n\u00a3557 billion, requiring an annual\ninterest payment of \u00a337 billion. To\nattempt just to pay the interest, the\nworld's poorest countries are forced\ninto using their resources to produce\ncash crops for the west.\nThus, over half the children in\nGhana are malnourished while over\nhalf of Ghana's farming land is\ngrowing cocoa for western\nchocolate bars. During the great\ndrought in the Sahel, production of\npeanuts for export actually\nincreased. Sudan was still exporting\nfood in 1990 when on the verge of\nencourage student opinion, rather\nthan wallowing in it's own ego.\nSo come on Felix, get a sense of\nhumour, get back on the students'\nside, and stop being so f rigging pompous!\nYours faithfully,\nChris Sweeting.\nfamine.\nIn Brazil, 400,000 children die\neach year from hunger related\ndiseases, yet Brazil is one of the\nworld's biggest food exporters. The\nnumber of child deaths per year in\nBrazil increased 12% in the first\ntwo years of the debt crisis.\nContrary to what is widely\nbelieved, the British banks have not\nwritten off their Third World Debt.\nWhat they have done is to 'provide\nfor' it, meaning they have assumed\nin their accounts that the debt, or\nmost of it, will never be repaid.\nThis makes no difference as far as\nthe countries who owe the money\nare concerned. The reason the\nbanks did this was because they can\nclaim tax relief on money they set\naside against non-repayment of the\ndebt. In fact, when they have\nprovided for the total amount owed,\nour banks will have received $7\nbillion in tax re leif, this is three\nDear Adam,\nOne way to get a machine to eat\nyour card in eight simple steps:\n1.

    "content": "21 February 1992 Felix 927 Reviews\nBetty Blue\nYes, the classic amour f ou film in\nthe 80s is back again. However, la\nversion integral e, re-cut by director\nJean-Jacques Beineix, contains an\nhour of previously unseen footage,\nwhich make up to a total running\ntime of three hours!\nNo, not an extra hour of bon king scenes. Nevertheless, these extra\nscenes are essential in accounting\nfor Betty's being driven into\ninsanity.\nBetty (Beatrice Dalle) walks into\nZorg's( Jean-Hughes Anglade) life\nby bon king every night and moving\ninto his place by the sea, where he\nis supposed to paint all the\nbungalows as a living. One day,\nBetty discovers Zorg's notebooks\ncontaining his works, which he\nthinks are nothing; whereas Betty\nis so impressed that she reckons\nthey should be published and Zorg\nshould concentrate on writing. To\nget Zorg out of his boring life, she\nburns his house down and they have\nto flee to Paris. From then on. their\nadventure moves on to some small\nprovince, in which most of the\nscenes of the unseen footage take\nplace, while Betty's hopes become\nshattered because of the refusal\nletters from publishers and her\nfailing to give Zorg a baby. Out of\ndespair. Betty plucks one of her\neyes out...\nIf you have seen the edited\nversion before and are not\nconvinced about Betty's self-destruction, the unseen footage\ncontains trivial, but important\nscenes that build up the tragedy, and\nsome gags as well. Highlights\ninclude Dominique Pinon's( the\nclown from Delicatessen) cameo as\na drug dealer. There is also the\nfunny bit about the mattress that\ntheir friend's dead mother sleeps in\nbefore. What's surprising to\nsomeone that has seen it many times\nbefore is the freshness contained in\nBetty and Zorg's characters, and the\npeople around them, and eventually\nthe film itself.\nAnd. for those who had missed\nit when it was first released, Betty\nBlue is certainly the film with\npassion.

The acting, by Paul\nFreeman and Sian Thomas is\nexcellent. The period when Judith\nis not talking is fascinating, seeing\nher act with her eyes alone.

    "content": "21 February 1992 Felix 927 AIDS Week\nin Masterton's perfect lover'.\n'How to be the\nPenetrative Sex\nFor those moments when there's no\noption but penetrative sex then the\nbest method of preventing HIV\ntransmission is by using 'your\nflexible rubber friend' - the condom\n(see separate item on condoms). As\nwell as the commonly known sheath\nthere is also a female condom\navailable which is also known as the\n'bikini condom'. You may find\nyourself with a partner who doesn't want to use a condom. 80% of\nyoung people use a condom when\nthey have sex. Don't risk your life\nwith the other 20%. Some men\ncomplain that condoms reduce\nsensitivity or that putting one on\ninterrupts love making. The fact is\nthat there are now many types of\ncondom available which do not\nreduce sensitivity and putting a condom on can become an erotic\npart of the sexual activity.\nAnd Finally....\nSafer sex is healthier sex. The key\nto safer sex in the age of AIDS is\nhonesty and open communication -things which have taken a back seat\nsince sexual freedom and\nHow old is AIDS?\nThe AIDS virus was passed to\nhumans from monkeys in African\nvillages between 140 and 160 years\nago. Initially confined to a handful\nof people in one or two villages,\npossibly contaminated from\nscratches and bites from monkeys,\nthis virus spread very slowly but\ngathered pace as larger numbers\nbecame infected.\nResearchers from Imperial\nCollege, London, led by Professor\nRoy Anderson, head of biological\nstatistics, have examined the spread\nof HIV in Africa. They conclude\nthat in some areas it now takes\nbetween one and three years for the\nnumber of cases to double in the\ngeneral population.\nIn some of the worst affected\nparts of the continent, tests on blood\ndonors and pregnant women have\nfound that between 20 and 30 per\ncent of people carry the virus. The\nImperial College team has found\nthat current HIV infection rates in\nAfrica are taking their biggest toll\nin women aged 20-25, who are at\na peak age for child bearing, and in\nmen aged 25-35.\nthink sex is for?\nperformance became the\nwatchwords. You may be the kind\nof person who finds it easier to have\nsex with your partner than to talk\nabout it with him or her. A sensible\n(and safe!) attitude would be to\nmake it part of your sex life to talk\nopenly about any worries and fears\nyou may have about HIV. Choosing\nthe right time and place to bring up\nthe subject of safer sex is important.\nYou are more likely to have a successful, relaxed conversation\nabout safer sex if you don't leave\nit until you are sexually aroused,\ndrunk, tired or in an emotional\nstate. It is usually best to bring the\nsubject up in a neutral setting (ie not\nin the bedroom). A useful way to\nstart the conversation is by referring\nto aTV programme or article about\nAIDS or HIV. This will allow you\nto find out what your partner thinks\nin general before moving onto the\nmore personal issues. Don't wait\nfor your partner to bring the subject\nup; it may never happen! The\nresponsibility in safer sex is above\nall to yourself - looking after your\nhealth. You can't always rely on a partner to do that for you.\nWhatever you do: if you're not\nconfident that it's safe then don't do\nit!\nCondoms\nWhat some people say:\n'They're passion killers. Just\nwhen you want to go on you have\nto stop and fumble around' - So\ntreat it as part of the sexual act -practice makes perfect?\n'It's like having a bath with\nwell ies on. I can't see the point of\nhaving sex with a bit of rubber in\nbetween' - Condoms are now so\nfine you lose little, if any, sensation.\n'If I carried a condom he'd call\nme a slag' - It's becoming accepted\nfor women to . carry condoms\nthey're sensible not foolish.\n'Why do we take condoms so\nseriously? Having decided to use\nthem, why not make them fun to\nWhat types are there:\nPlain, ribbed, Straight end, Flared,\nContoured, Flavoured, Coloured,\nUltra thin, Glow in the Dark ('No\nmore fumble before you fondle')....\nThe list is endless. For a complete\nguide there is a leaflet 'Which\nCondom' available, alternatively\nvisit Condomania in Soho and\nexamine the displays.\nTo be sure of their safety, always\nlook for the BSI Kitemark as this\nmeans the condoms are tested.\nWhere to get them:\nThis is a matter of personal choice.\nCondoms have come out from\nbehind the counter. They're now\nsuch a part of everyday life that you\ncan buy them from pharmacists,\ngarages, record shops,\nsupermarkets, barbers, clothes\nshops, pubs, slot machines and mail\norder.\nIf you want free supplies and/or\nadvice about sex and contraception\nthem you can go to the IC Health\ncentre or any other family planning\nclinic. All you need to do is register\nyour name in their totally\nconfidential records.\nFor the condom connoisseurs,\nthere is a new type of shop -'Condomania' opened in Soho and\nrecently one in Leeds. The aim is\nto make condoms hip or even chic.\nAlmost every one of the thousands\nof brands of condoms on the market\nis stocked and there should be no\ntrouble with embarrassment as the\nshop assistants are trained to cope\nwith embarrassed customers. As the\nMD, Martin Foreman, says \"No\none expects people to dress in the\nsame way in the daytime so why\nshould they have such limited\nchoice about what they put on at\nnight?\"\n\n"

Nasty lefty, subversive\nstudents can then be packed off\nhome to their safe Labour seats,\nremoving vital student votes from\nkey marginal s, such as Kensington.\nIt is also no coincidence that the\nproximity of the same general\nelection has prompted a sudden\ninterest in student matters, not to\ninfluence students, of course.\nStudents will see any resultant scam\nfor what it is. The whole approach\nseems to be of duping Joe Public\ninto believing that Conservatives\ncare about students.\nFelix and The Guardian have\nalready stated the facts of the story.\nThe Downing Street policy unit,\nunder Mrs Sarah Hogg, has been\ntrawling for new charter ideas to\nbreath life into a government\npublicity exercise which r has dissolved in Grecian 2000. Several\nbrainstorming sessions were held\nduring January, both in Chequers,\nthe Prime Minister's country\nresidence, and in Downing Street.\nThe results are now beginning to\nleak out.\nNew ideas to date include\ncharters for health, transport,\nschools, road users, benefit offices,\njelly bean manufacturers, train\nspotters, union presidents etc. The\nUncharted Waters\n'... The idea of students assessing\nlecturers' pay is not a Conservative\nidea. It's just not on... It may be\nsomething the Labour Party would\ndo, but it is certainly not one of our\nideas.'\nReally? It may be that Ms.\nKesswick has not been fully briefed\nby the Secretary of State. It may\nalso be that she is vehemently\nopposed to the idea because the\ncharter came from the political\nsection of 10 Downing Street, and\nnot from the political section of the\nDepartment of Health. Or it could\nbe that the Conservative Party is\nkite flying; leaking an idea to assess\nreaction while denying that the idea\neven exists. It allows ministers to\nDeclan Curry,\nof IC Radio,\nlooks into the\n'student charter'\nIt could also be that the general\nelection has been suggested for\nApril so that the public can be saved\nfrom a long winded, bitter, sterile\nslang ing match. Roll up, roll up, the\nend is nigh, as placards read just\nabout everywhere.\nAnd as for proof that\nConservatives care? Who needs it?\nThe Conservative government has\nincreased opportunity by increasing\naccess to higher education. Loans\nare designed to allow funding for\nthose to whom it is not available.\nStudent numbers are up. A students'\ncharter would be ideal to improve\non the service.\nSo why is the Department of\nEducation and Science denying that\ncharter plans exist?\nThe sources that tell us that\ncharter plans do exist are\nimpeccable. These people, who\nwork in the Cabinet Office, have the\near of the Prime Minister, and they\nhad the ear of the Prime Minister\nat the Downing Street seminar at\nwhich the idea was discussed.\nwo d ge of paper is in danger of\ncatching up with the multitude of\nLabour policy documents, mark\ntwo, of course.\nThe students' charter emanated\nfrom a Downing Street session. The\nEducation Secretary was asked by\nsenior civil servants if he was in\nfavour of various proposals. Mr Clarke said that he was. These\nmeasures included a formal link\nbetween students' assessments of\nlecturers performance and future\nlecture pay awards, effectively\ngiving students influence over\nlecturers' pay.\nIt is this idea which has caused\nmost of the storm which followed\nthe revelation of the charter. The\ncynicism and hostility which\ngreeted the move was not confined\nto natural government supporters.\nTessa Kesswick, senior policy\nadvisor to Kenneth Clarke, has\ndescribed the measure as 'not a Conservative idea.' She went on to\nsay that:\n'We might do a students'\ncharter... we have no plans for a students' charter, and even if we\nhad, it would certainly not be on the\nterms listed in the Guardian...\ndo opinion polling without paying\nfor it, and to withdraw ideas without\nlosing face.\nThe old line that something is not\nbelieved until it is officially denied,\ndoes not hold totally true in this\ncase. Grant Edwards, at the Cabinet\nOffice Citizen's Charter Unit told\nus that 'the idea for a students'\ncharter may have been discussed'\nat the charter mark seminar in\nChequers. We have been told that\nthe discussion took place at Number\n10. What is important here is that\nhe did not say that no discussion\ntook place. This is as close as you\nwill get to a civil servant admitting\nthat a specific political conversation\ntook place.\nWhat will go into a students'\ncharter? The usual source of\nConservative ideas, the 'think\ntanks,' don't appear to have any\nproposals on the table. Madison\nPerry, chairman of the right wing\nAdam Smith Institute, told us that\nthey have done no student work for\ntwo years. Interestingly, the\nInstitute of Economic Affairs has\nalso done no student work for two\nyears. Both these groups have been\nexceptionally influential in shaping\n16\u2014\n\n"

The full\nresults of the survey are expected\non March 11th.

A letter from the\nDepartment of Social Security has\nbeen sent to nearly 3.5 million\npeople who have not made\nsufficient contributions from their\nwages to count towards a pension.\nThe letter does not demand\npayment, but says that unless the\nshortfall is paid, any money\ncollected so far that year will be\ndiscounted. Many will not benefit\nfrom paying the shortfall as the\ncontribution will only count towards\nthe basic pension, or widow's pension for a married man, but not\ntowards unemployment benefit,\nsickness benefit, invalidity benefit,\nmaternity allowance or state\nearnings related pensions.\nFunds Up\nImperial College stands to gain a large increase in its budget from\nproposed changes in the methods of\nfunding Universities. Figures\nreleased by the University Funding\nCouncil (UFC) last Monday mean\nthat research funding will increase\nby 11 %, but it will be spread more\nselectively between what the UFC describes as 'research dominated'\ninstitutions. This compares with the\n8.5% rise in funding for\nUniversities admitting greater\nnumbers of students, which is the\ntraditional method of higher\neducation funding.\nThis has increased speculation\nthat Universities will be split into\na two tier system of teaching and\nresearch, with a US-style graduate\nschool system developing. The\nUFC has denied this to i CNN, saying that 'we are not forcing any\none to do anything, there will be a lot of people in the middle'. This\nhas been apparently contradicted by\nProfessor Graeme Davis, UFC Chairman, who told the national\nmedia that teaching and research\nwere 'incompatible'.\nRoger Frost, Press officer at the\nDepartment of Education, said that\nIt may not be necessary to pay a missing year, as to qualify for a basic pension there only need to be\n44 years of full contributions for\nwomen and 49 for men. This allows\nfor five missed working years from\nApril 6th on your 16th birthday to\nApril 5th before your retirement\nage. A basic pension will still be\ngiven if you miss more years, but\nwill be reduced appropriately.\nCredit years are also available in\ncases of unemployment or\ninvalidity. You may not gain\nanything by paying the extra\ncontribution whilst at College.\nIf you are unsure, contributions\nmay be paid up to six years in\narrears, so a shortfall last year\n(1990-91) may be made up as late\nas April 5th1997. while the UFC were autonomous of\nGovernment the changes were\ntrying 'to reward places of the\ngreatest excellence and value for\nmoney.'\nImperial College stands to gain a significant amount from this change\nand has increased the number of\nundergraduates by 1.7% last year,\ncompared to a national increase of\n6%. The number of postgraduate\nstudents in Imperial increased by\n9.7% in the past year. Postgraduate\nstudents receive higher funding\nfrom UFC. The idea of creating an\nexclusively research institution is\nnot being considered by Imperial\nCollege Planning Department, and\na source in the admissions\ndepartment said that undergraduate\nnumbers were being increased\nwithin the 'boundary of targets', but\ncould not say what the targets were.\nThe proposed changes would\nmean a cut of 1.5% in funding per\nstudent for educational institutes,\nand student numbers are expected\nto increase so fast that they will\noutweigh increases in funding.\nDetails of institutions that will\nbenefit are to be released in two\nweeks time.\nPoll Tax\nWestminster City Council have\novercharged hundreds of IC\nstudents for poll tax this week by\nbilling them the full \u00a336. The\nstudents, who live in the Princes\nGardens Halls of Residence, have\nreceived half year poll tax bills of\n\u00a318, which equates to a full year\ncharge of \u00a336. Students should only\npay 20% of the full contribution,\nwhich is about \u00a3 3 .\nCollege Finance Manager,\nMalcolm Aldridge, has written to\nWestminster Council to complain\nabout the blunder and to request re-billing. He told Felix this week that\nstudents should write individually to\nWestminster Council to demand a correction to .their bills. The address\nis Community Charge Enquiries,\nCity Hall, Victoria Street, SW1.\nThe announced poll tax figure for\nnext year is the same as that for last\nyear. Increases in costs due to\ninflation have been absorbed by\nsavings made in cutting central costs\nand from \u00a35 million saved by\ncompulsory competitive tendering.\nExtra spending in the district\nincludes \u00a32 million on foot ways and\n\u00a3 1 . 4 million on children and\ncommunity care services.\nRoadshow\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust will be\nsending a roadshow to Imperial\nCollege as part of AIDS awareness\nweek.

However, it occurred to\nthe Princess Concert Band that if\nshe was so small her voice may not\nbe heard at the approaching Conceit\nBand Fairy Concert.\nSo the King of the land sent his\nmessengers to the far reaches of his\nrealm proclaiming to all his subjects\nthat all wind and brass instrument\nplayers should meet in the Great\nHall on Mondays at 5.30pm.

The film seems to\nhave i been made for middle-age\nparents as a warning of what is to\ncome.

In the first game\nagainst RHBNC, Annan Galloway\ngot bored and decided to tw at their\nforward conceding a penalty and\nthen another leaving IC 2-0 down.\nHowever, a great free-kick by\nRafael Martinez and a40 yard shot\nfrom Tom Robson finished the\ngame with a22 draw.\nReading were IC's next\nopponents and frankly they should\nnot have come. Two goals in the\nfirst 5 minutes from Felix Francis\nand Gary Mahoney ensured IC's dominance for most of the game.\nReading came back but a goal from\nMarv Abdo and his boil left the\ngame beyond reach. Man of the\nmatch was awarded to Tom\n'Fingers' Hulbert who made some\ngreat saves with the help of Paul\nNelson, Annan, Dave Phillips and\nTom.\nKings College who hadn't lost a game yet were next in line for an\nIC thrashing. Before they could say\n'what a good looking bunch IC are',\nGary had struck 2 goals in the back\nof the net. With 10 minutes to go,\nthe score was 2-2 but Stuart 'Pecs'\nWatson got the winner leaving\nKings 3-2 down at full time.\nNext came Brunei in a meaningless game as qualification\nhad already been ensured. The hair\nraising captain, Marv, displayed his\nexcellent skills in a well executed\ngoal - pity they scored two. Man of\nthe match was Paul.\nThe visit of Nottingham finally\nsaw IC's dreams of U AU glory\nshattered. Missing their midfield\nmaestro Felix to the dubious calling\nof UL U, IC labour ed to a30 loss,\nalthough the score line flattered the\nopposition.\nIC's powers in cup competitions\nextended to the London Cup which\nsaw IC cruise to the semi-finals.\nDespite giving RHBNC a30 start,\nIC moved into a higher gear to win\nthe first round match 4-3, with goals\nfrom Marv, Felix, Rafael and the\nwinner, again, from Stuart.\nThe quarter-finals saw K CH stuffed 7-1 with goals from Marv,\nBob, Gary (2), and a glorious\nhat rick by Rafael, scoring the goal\nBadminton\nOn 12th February, the Imperial\nBadminton Ladies team played in\nthe quarter-finals of the U AU. With\nthe luck of the draw, we played at\nhome against Brunei University.\nBoth of our men's teams have\nrecently been knocked out in the\nprevious rounds, so it was up to us\nto pick up the ashes. We felt we had\na good chance to get through since\nwe beat Brunei in the first round.\nHowever, we did cast doubts\ntowards their first pair who were\nvery strong indeed. To our surprise,\nthey were not as strong as we\nanticipated them to be. Our first\npair (Uta Boltz and Wendy Tan)\nwon their match in a truly\nmagnificent manner. Our second\npair (Wendy Yates and Emily Fok)\nshowed tremendous strength and\nconfidence to beat their opposition\n15-2 and 15-1. Our third pair\n(Claire Roberts and Jennifer Lau)\nfinished in an equally marvellous\nfashion to win 15-7 and 15-2.\nWe only needed two more games\nto secure our place in the semi-finals. Our spirits were high and our\ndream to go through to the semis\nwere about to come true. In the end\nIC beat Brunei 7-2. The only\ndisappointment was the fact that we\nonly had four supporters (not\nsurprising since you never informed\nFelix of the match - Ed) We would\nlike to thank them for coming and\nhope that we get more support next\ntime.\nNow we are in the semi-finals\nwhich will take place tomorrow,\nSaturday 22nd February, at Cardiff\nUniversity. We shall be competing\nwith'the strongest university teams,\nsome of which have the finest\nbadminton players in England. It\nwould be a wonderful experience\nfor the Ladies team, and who\nknows, maybe we will bring back\na trophy with us!\nof the season with a volley from\noutside the area. The back 5: Tim,\nAnnan, Paul, Tom and Dave, were\ndenied a clean sheet through a dubious penalty. Even after 2\ngames, IC were the only team not\nto be beaten by Kings but this\nchanged in a51 loss in the semi-finals, with top scorer Gary getting\nIC's only goal. Man of the match\nwas Annan.\nIt should be said that despite the\nKings and Nottingham games IC\nl sts have had a good season and the\nline up in the picture is still\nunbeaten. Only injuries and\ndisappearance of their good luck\ncharm, the captain's boil, has\nstopped IC from going all the way.\nRugby\nThe Imperial College rugby first\nXV beat Surrey University by 20\npoints to 3 last week at Harlington,\nin the quarter-finals of the U AU Championship. The conditions did\nnot allow flowing movement of the\nball but the forwards soon took\ncontrol.\nJohn Fowler was denied two tries\nas the Surrey sc rummage collapsed\non their own line, resulting in the\naward of two penalty tries, Simon\nPearson scored a try from another\npushover. Stuart Paynter scored\ntwo penalty goals and converted one\ntry, missing one from in front of the\nposts - charged down.\nICRFC are now set to meet\nDurham University at a neutral\nground on Wednesday 26th February, three days after the\nGutteridge Cup final. Free transport\nwill be available for spectators to\nboth matches and support would be\nwelcome.\nOSC Nite\nThe OS C is proud to present\nInternational Nite '92, on Friday\n28th February.

    "content": "AIDS Week Felix 927 21 February 1992\nHow is AIDS Transmitted?\nWhen AIDS was first identified in\nthe USA, all the people affected\nseemed to be homosexual or\nbisexual. However, shortly\nafterwards the disease was also\ndiscovered among heterosexual\ninjected drug users. Before long this\nheterosexual trend was confirmed\nwith the diagnosis of AIDS among\nthem and women who did not inject\ndrugs. It was also diagnosed among\nrecipients of blood products such as\nhaemophilia cs. It soon became apparent that\nthere was a considerable\nThe Ins and Outs of AIDS\nHow is AIDS\ntransmitted?\nDo we now need\ntelephone\nsan it is ers? The\nvirus itself is far\nless infectious\nthan the hysteria\nsurrounding it\nheterosexual AIDS problem in\nAfrica and that AIDS clearly was\nnot a new disease at all. It seemed\nto have been in Central Africa for\nat least fifteen years and perhaps\nmany more.\nAlthough AIDS first appeared in\ndifferent groups of people in\ndifferent countries, HIV is\ninvariably transmitted in a similar\nway, through the transfer of\ninfected body fluids.\nHIV has been found in semen,\ntears, breast milk, vaginal\nsecretions and blood. The means by\nwhich HIV is passed on, or\n'transmitted', from an infected\nperson to an un infected person are\ntherefore very limited and require\na degree of intimate contact.\n\u2022 Unprotected sex. Penetrative\nsex between men and women or\nmen and men, both vaginal and anal\ncan lead to transmission of HIV.\nAnal sex is associated with the\nhighest risk. The presence of other\nsexually transmitted disease, such\nas genital ulcers, may also increase\nthe possibility of transmission.\nUnprotected oral sex, and sexual\ncontact between women is\nassociated with a lower risk of\ntransmission.\n\u2022 Infected blood and blood\nproducts. HIV transmission via this\nroute has now been virtually\neliminated in industrialised\ncountries through routine screening\nof donated blood. Most developing\ncountries are now also improving\ntheir screening of blood for HIV.\n\u2022 Re-use of needles or syringes\ncan lead to the exchange of small\nquantities of blood, leading to\ntransmission of the virus from one\nperson to the next. Injecting drug\nusers who share 'works' can\ntransmit the virus in this way. Reusing needles in a medical setting,\nwhich still occurs in some less\ndeveloped countries, could also lead\nto transmission.\nIt is possible for HIV to be\ntransmitted if the blood of an\ninfected person gets through a break\nin the skin of another.\n\u2022 From mother to child\n(prenatal transmission). Estimates\nare that around one in four children\nborn to mothers with HIV infection\nwill themselves be infected with\nHIV. There is also a slight chance\nof infection via breast milk.\nHIV cannot be transmitted through:\n\u2022 Coughing\n\u2022 Sneezing\n\u2022 Sharing a toilet seat\n\u2022 Mosquitoes and other insects\n\u2022 Sharing a drinking fountain\n\u2022 Eating food prepared by\nsomeone who has HIV\n\u2022 Showers and swimming pools\n\u2022 Sweat, tears and saliva\n\u2022 Animals and pets\nWith regard to social contact, it is\nthe person with AIDS who may be\nin danger. They are more\nsusceptible to infections such as\ncolds, flu, measles or chicken-pox,\nwith serious consequences due to\ntheir deficient immune system.\nDrugs & HIV\nPeople who inject drugs are not\nonly at risk of HIV infection from\nsexual contact, but also from the\nsharing of infected injecting\nequipment. Sharing 'works' is the\nsurest way of transmitting HIV, as\ninfected blood can be injected\ndirectly into the bloodstream of an\nun infected person. The total for\nknown HIV positive people through\ninjecting drugs in the UK is 2179\n(Sept '91), with 223 cases of AIDS\nand 120 deaths.\nUsers of injecting drugs can\nprotect themselves by looking at a range of options for drug use other\nthan injecting. There is a growing\nrange of agencies which can\nprovide help and advice on\nchanging their pattern of drug use.\nDrug users who continue to inject\ndrugs can protect themselves by\nnever sharing equipment (eg\nOpen sealed wrapper with care.\nTake cafe not bo damage {Me\ncondom.

Sterile\nequipment is available from needle\nexchange schemes and from a growing number of high street\npharmacies. Injecting with sterile\nworks or a set kept strictly for use\nby one person offers the best\nprotection for those who continue\nto inject. If equipment is not shared,\nit cannot spread HIV. However, if\nsterile or individual equipment is\nnot available the next best thing is\nto clean equipment using\ndisinfectant. This may offer some\nprotection, although it is difficult to\ndisinfect plastic and is no substitute\nfor sterile works. Washing\nequipment in water is not sufficient.\nSexual partners of drug injectors,\nwho do not themselves inject, risk\ninfection through unsafe sexual\nactivities with their drug injecting\npartners.\nThere are four points to consider\nin order to stay healthy:\n1. Stop sharing. Always try to get\nyour own set of works. Find a local\nsyringe exchange. Use a clean set\nof works for every fix. Use your\nown spoon for cooking up. Use\nclean water to mix with the gear.\nDispose of used works safely.\n2. If you have to share, clean\nyour works. Clean used equipment\nimmediately it is last used. Separate\nneedle, barrel and plunger and clean\nthem in hot tap water and household\ndetergent. Remove all traces of\nblood. Rinse the works thoroughly\nwith clean water. Do the same with\nany spoons etc.\n3. Stop fixing. There are lots of\nalternative ways of taking any drug\nwhich do not involve fixing or skin-popping: smoking or snorting\nheroin, snorting speed, dropping\npills, freebasing coke, oral\nsubstitutes like methadone.\n4. Stop using. Find a local drugs\nagency to give advice on self-help\nmethods of coming off or other\navailable treatment options. Join a support group. Consider a re-hab\nprogramme.\nThe best way to protect yourself\nfrom HIV and to stay healthy is not\nto take drugs at all. If you require\nany information about kicking the\nhabit call:\nMainliners 071-274 4000\nRelease 071-377 5905\nScoda 071-430 2341\nTurning Point 071-437 3523\n1. You pick up a girl who's got a pack of condoms. Are you:\na) insulted\nb) relieved\nc) excited she's carrying a ten-pack\n2. Your partner asks you to perform\na sexual act that might involve\nblood passing between you. Do\nyou:\na) lie back and think of England\nb) refuse point blank because of\nthe risk of HIV infection\nc) say 'not tonight, darling.

In the good old rag\ntradition the found some quite\nsilly/mad going's on. Penguin, the\nRag Chairman, played billiards\nagainst the Grim Reaper in the\nmiddle of Trafalgar Square.\nNeedless to say, the police got\nsomewhat worried about this and\nalmost had them removed, but after\nbeing convinced that it was all in a good cause, chose to ignore them.\nThe little dagger turned out to be\nNext Saturday is 29th February\nis called Leap Day and that's exactly what's happening.\nIt's the culmination of a large\nseries of events that have been\noccurring at universities up and\ndown the country for the last month\nor so, to raise vast sums of money\nfor Oxfam. The main event that\nmost universities have been\nparticipating in has been a sponsored 1,000 mile leap frog,\nwith each university contributing a couple of miles or so.\nIt's on the leap frog theme that\nOxfam have been concentrating.\nTheir mascot for this promotion is\nLeap Frog, springy badges of\nwhom have been on sale and it's on\nthe same theme that all of the leap\nday's events have been planned.\nOn the Saturday morning in\nBattersea Park, just the other side\nof the Thames, there will be the\nculmination of the fundraising done\nso far. Various things are already\nplanned, including a bouncy castle\n(in the shape of Leap Frog) for the\na seven foot sword, we allowed a bit of artistic license there. Poddy\nwas kicked out of the pub he was\nsupposed to be marshalling in and\nproceeded to spook unsuspecting\ntourists anywhere near Piccadilly\nCircus.\nSpanner and Bolt starred on the\nday for a two hour performance as\ndid the Theta bearers minus Theta\n(the latter indisposed, affected by a Welsh parasite). 1 hope that\neverybody involved had a great\nday. We raised \u00a31,084, which was\nunfortunately not enough to win the\ncomputer that Winged Fellowship\nhad on offer. A small consolation,\nhowever came from the Hard Rock\nCafe, who spontaneously gave us\nsome merchandise as prizes. The\ntop collector was Tamsin 'Sex on\nkiddies and the last of the 1,000\nmiles of leap frogs which is being\nplanned and run by IC Rag. We\nshall be needing all the help that we\ncan get, so if you're going to be free\nfor the morning come up to the.rag\noffice one lunch time and we'll tell\nyou how you can take part.\nIn the afternoon it's off down the\npub and seeing as if you're a good\nstudent you'll be there anyway, this\nbit shouldn't be too difficult. The\nsecond part of the day is being run\nin conjunction with the Firkin Pubs.\nStudents and others are being\nencouraged to go down to their\nlocal Firkin pub before the day and\nsign up for the sponsored leap. Each\nperson will be sponsored for a distance that they can leapfrog\nbetween 1.00 and 5.00pm on the\nday. The leapfrogging will be done\nin (or just outside) each pub, with\nthe pub that raises the most money\nin that time being given a large\nalcohol prize for all that have spent\nthe afternoon in the pub.\nIf you have a moments break\nlegs' Braisher who collected \u00a3150.\nThe winners of the game were a team from Cambridge (shame on\nyou IQ.with the top IC team\ndropping hints that the marking was\nunfair (shame on you top team).\nThe big party that Winged\nFellowship put on for all the\ncollectors from all the Rags that\ncame down, was a big success\nexcept for the fact that Ents double\nbooked. Ents kindly allowed us to\njoin the storm in' disco they already\nhad going.\nFinally, thanks to everyone\ninvolved, and if anybody is\ninterested, whether involved in the\nday or not, STOIC have a short\nvideo of the event so go up and have\na look.\nChris Pease.\nbetween all your leaping on the day,\nthen you can sample the special leap\nfrog beer that the Firkin pubs have\nbeen brewing for the occasion. It is\nlikely that by the time that this issue\nis distributed the beer will already\nbe on sale, so go and by a pint.\nNeedless to say, all of the proceeds\nfrom the beer are also going to\nOxfam.\nLastly, even as you read this,\nplans are afoot for a large press\ncovered event to precede and\npublicise the day. If all goes to plan\nthen next Friday, in the early\nevening, members of IC Rag will\nbe playing a large game of human\nleap frog draughts, probably against\nanother college. We can't let you\nknow any more about this at the\npresent because we haven't yet got\npermission, and would not want\nupset the people we may be asking.\nHopefully all will be revealed in\nnext weeks issue.\nAgain, if you want to help with\nthis then come up to the Rag office\nany lunchtime.\nBIBIC\nLast weekend students from\nImperial College collected \u00a3804.59\nfor BIBIC, the British Institute for\nBrain Injured Children. Various\nother Rags came down including\nD.U.C.K.( Durham Uni Charity\nweeK), who were only able to come\ndown because individuals\nassociated with IC Rag were able\nto put them up for the night (Hyde\nPark Relay were using the crash\nspace in the Southside gym). Well\ndone to all concerned in collecting\nboth coins and Duckies.\nAfter Oxfam's Leap Day (see\nrelevant article), the next collection\nis for MEN CAP( Mentally\nHandicapped) on Wednesday 4th March. It will be collecting how we\nknow best, in the City of London\nitself, as well as all of the mainline\nstations and underground stations.\nIf interested come up to the new\nRag/Ents office any lunchtime, or\nto the Rag meeting on Fridays.\nOnwards!\nAs the term moves further on, so\nI.C. Rag moves further afield and\ntomorrow students from Imperial\nhit the usually picturesque and\ntranquil cathedral town of Bath.\nJoining with Oxford Rag, the\ncollectors will be raising as much\nas possible for UNICEF (United\nNations Children's Fund). The\nplaces have already been filled, but\nthere will be more Rag Raids next\nterm.\nLeaping for Oxfam\n\n"

He quotes sources at\nSabre Access Control Systems Ltd,\nthe manufacturers of the system, as\nsaying that individual cards will\noften become inoperable. This may\nlead to attempts to ensure access,\nsuch as propping doors open. But\nKeith Reynolds, IC chief security\nofficer, is sure that any problems\nwill only be minor teething\nproblems and procedures to rectify\nproblems will be quick and simple.\nMr Reynolds said that he had\ninstalled similar systems in the past\nand in 18 months, with 4000 cards,\nonly 3 cards went wrong.

On the whole\nmost medical students spend little\ntime with these patients except for\nthe odd ward round, I am very glad\nthat I had the opportunity to spend\na week there.\nDay 1\u2014What do I say to these\npeople?\nHow does HIV affect their lives?\nWill they realise how unsure I am?\nI met the Ward Sister that\nmorning and she suggested that I go\nand see two of the patients who she\nchecked were willing to talk to me.\nThat morning I managed to\novercome some of my inhibitions\nand worries about HIV + ve patients\nand began to learn how very varied\nthe patients can be.\nNot every patient knows or has\naccepted their diagnosis, while\nothers are angry, depressed, or have\ncome to terms with it and are keen\nto talk. Almost all the patients I spoke to during the week are\nincredibly well informed about\nHIV, AIDS and all the latest\ntreatments, they want to know why,\nwhen and how they will be treated\nand certainly will not just leave it\nto the Medical Profession to do\nwhat is best!\nDuring the week I also met the\npartners and sometimes the family\nof many of the patients, they may\nknow different amounts about the\ndiagnosis so confidentiality is very\nimportant. The partners are often\ninvolved in much of the caring for\na patient.\nWhilst some of the patients are\nseriously ill and require a high\ndegree of nursing care, many of the\npatients are young, very\nindependent and able to look after\nthemselves, therefore unlike\nworking on many other wards the\nnursing care required is often not\nso much washing and feeding, but\nhas a large Psychosocial content and\ncomplex Drug rounds. In addition\nthe nurses work with Community\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust\nThere are a number of\nvoluntary groups\nwho help AIDS\nvictims, as well\nas sexual\nproblems in\ngeneral.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust was\nfounded in 1982 and is today the\nleading AIDS charity in the UK, providing practical support, help,\ncounselling and advice for anyone\nwith or concerned about AIDS or\nHIV infection. It involves over 800\npeople, the vast majority of whom\nare volunteers, who provide\nservices available to anyone\nconcerned about AIDS, ARC( AIDS Related Complex) and HIV.\nThe Trust set up their AIDS\nhelpline in February 1984, the first\none to be established in the UK. It\nnow runs from 3pm to 10pm every\nday including weekends offering\ntelephone counselling support and\ninformation. Helpline counsellors\nare skilled and trained people who\ndeal with up to 1,500 calls every\nmonth. A priority line is available\nso that people with AIDS, ARC and\nHIV can speak to a counsellor\nimmediately. Lawyers are available\nfor advice and information on the\nLegal Helpline every Wednesday\nevening at 7pm until 10pm. The\nLegal Advice Service has over 60\nlawyers giving information and\nundertakes casework on a whole\nrange of AIDS, ARC and HIV\nissues.\nThe Welfare Rights Service\noffers advice to people with AIDS,\nARC and HIV on subjects such as\nSocial Security, debt and\nentitlement to service from Local\nAuthorities. The service is available\nto refer clients to the most\nappropriate agency to deal\nconfidentially with their problems.\nThe service is also able to provide\nexpert technical information for\nadvice and support workers from\nother agencies. For example Social\nSecurity case law and the\nmonitoring of good practice in the\nDHSS. It also specialises in the\ndecision and implementation of\ntraining packages for advice and\ncare agencies.\nThe Trust provides a number of\ndifferent counselling and support\nservices to both men and women.\nThey are available to people who\nhave AIDS, ARC and HIV and to\nthose caring for them. The services\nare free and strictly confidential and\nprovided by trained and\nexperienced counsellors.\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust\noffers health education in the form\nof speakers, conferences and a roadshow, giving advice and\ninformation on AIDS, ARC and\nHIV. safer sex and drugs education.\nTerrence Higgins Trust\n52-54 Grays Inn Road\nLondon W C1X8 JU Administration 071-831 0330\nHelpline 071-242 1010\nLegal Line 071-405 2381\n\u201414\u2014\n\n"

Madison Perry told us that\nthe Adam Smith Institute had no\ninterest in the NUS. NUS bashing\nis therefore left to that last bastion\nof open membership, Conservative\nStudents. Though a senior official\nof Conservative Students told IC\nRadio News that they had no plans\nto take the NUS 'to the cleaners',\nthe NUS fears a fresh attack on their\nposition, following a period of\nconsiderable silence.\nThis 'fresh attack' seems to be the\nmotive behind the idea that\nstudents' unions should become\nself-financing. This chestnut is part\nof an old, long running and\nthoroughly pathetic attempt by the\ngovernment to strangle the NUS.\nThe scheme is pathetic simply\nbecause it has failed. Utterly. The\nonly group which is successfully\nstrangling the NUS is the NUS.\nSo apart from NUS bashing, what\nelse is likely to appear in the\nstudents' charter? Not much, really.\nThere are plans to increase the\nspeed of payment of your grant, but\nnot to increase the grant itself.\nThere are plans for faster loans, but\nnot fatter loans. Not a whisper on\ninterest free loans, and certainly\nnothing on the graduate tax, as\nfloated by the Institute of Public\nPolicy Research and the Fabian\nSociety, among others.\nThis gives us a post-it note of a charter. But what about opposition\nplans for a student charter?\nAccording to Labour's Higher\nEducation spokesman, Andrew\nSmith, there are none. Labour\nwon't introduce a charter, but they\nplan to scrap student loans,\nintroduce a fairer grant system,\nrestore the vacation hardship\nallowance, and bring in targeted\nhousing assistance. Labour also\nopposes moves to reduce student\nrepresentation on student governing\nbody, plans to introduce a pay\nreview body for lecturers, and\nrejects 'perennial attacks on\nstudents' unions from the\nConservative right wing'. No, of\ncourse it isn'ta charter. It's a wish\nlist. The only question they haven't answered is 'where's the money\ncoming from?'.\nAre the two main parties even\ninterested in buying the student\nvote? Labour, which has for so long\ntaken the student vote for granted,\nhave now discovered the harsh\nreality that 'student' does not equate\nwith 'Labour-voting'. The\nConservatives had initial hopes that\nthis new style floating vote would\ndrift to them. With this now\nimprobable, Conservatives have\nshown that they are perfectly\ncapable of by-passing the student\nvote, especially in those key\nmarginal s like York. First we saw\nthe now-you-see-it, now-you-don't charter. Now we see that come the\nelection, the student voice may not\neven be heard.\n\n"

To\ncountless billions more, life is\nnothing but a fifty year long\ncollection of assorted miseries.\nMeasles kills millions of children in\nwhat is termed 'the third world' -a term which puts the majority of\npeople on the planet at the end of\nthe queue. Perhaps for 'third world'\nwe should read 'third class.'\nSo forgive me if I promulgate an\nunusual view concerning AIDS.\nDeath is an appalling tragedy, no\nmatter who it is who dies, so I find\nit nothing less than revolting that so\nmuch money is being spent on\nfinding expensive drugs which will\nonly benefit a few hundred thousand\n- at the most - when minimal\ninvestment would save millions of\nlives and improve billions more. If\nyou think any anti-AIDS drug will\nbenefit any of the millions who have\nit in Africa, think again. To\ngovernments who spend what little\nthey have on buying equipment to\nkill large numbers of people more\neffectively, drugs are a luxury,\nparticularly since they cannot feed\nthose who would survive. Don't get\nme wrong - AIDS is a horrible\ndisease, it is not a 'punishment', nor\ndoes anyone 'deserve' it and I wish\nthat nobody had it - hence I view\nthe information contained within\nthis issue, which aims to prevent the\nspread of the disease, with great\napproval. The hysteria surrounding\nthe disease is completely out of\nproportion to the damage it does.\nMore people die in traffic accidents.\nIs anything done about this? No.\nThe image that immediately\npresents itself is of an evening party\nof self indulgent brats complaining\nbitterly that it may come to an end,\nwhile the poor of the town press\ntheir noses up against the window.\nAIDS is avoidable. It is no more\ndeadly than a hundred other\ndiseases, but merely because it has\nput the frighten ers on the 'first\nworld', so used to doing exactly\nwhat it likes, buckets of money has\nbeen poured into it.\nI hope a cure is found for AIDS,\nand I wish I could help those who\nhave it, but to be impartial about the\nissue, I wish far more strongly that\nstarving countries could be given\naccess to the cure they need. Unlike\nAIDS, the cure for starvation is\nknown. If a cure for AIDS is found,\nlike the cure for starvation, that cure\nwill never benefit the developing\nworld. After all, they are all\nforeigners, mostly black, and they\nhave committed the worst sin of all\n- they are very poor.\nChanging their Spots\nThere appears to be a flurry of\nname changing going on in the\nacademic establishments around the\ncountry at the moment. The\nUniversity of Wales College,\nCardiff (UWCC) has mooted the\npossibility of changing to the\n'University of Cardiff if the\nPolytechnic of Wales becomes the\n'University of Glamorgan.' In this\nweek's Pluto, of Lancashire\nPolytechnic, the lead story was of\nthe possibility of becoming the\n'University of Lancashire in\nPreston' (UCLiP). Pluto also\nreported that Oxford University\nmay become the 'University of\nCentral Oxfordshire in Oxford,'\nallowing Oxford Polytechnic to\nbecome 'Oxford University.' And\nthe Polytechnic of Central London\nis thinking of becoming the\n'University of Westminster.'\nWhat the hell is going on? I suspect each institution is trying to\noutbid their competitors by finding\nthe most cumbersome name which\nwill stick out in a list. By this yard\nstick the Imperial College of\nScience, Technology and Medicine\nshould remain so for quite a while.\nSadly, the Imperial bit does seem\nrather old fashioned, and college is,\nafter all, a diminutive version of an\nacademic institution. Given that the\nCollege has obvious pretensions\ntowards independence, and it gets\ndirectly funded by the Universities'\nFunding Council (UFC), unlike all\nother London University colleges,\nit seems likely that we will graduate\nto Universitydom within the decade\nfuture. And what if we merge with\nthe Royal College of Music in\nPrince Consort Road? That would\nlend a far more civilised air to the\ncollege, as would merger with the\nnearby Royal College of Art. There\nhave long been rumblings of merger\nwith the Royal Holloway and\nBedford New College, near Staines,\nand Brunei University in Uxbridge.\nSt Mary's may soon open\nnegotiations with the Charing Cross\nHospital.

    "content": "Opinion Felix 927 21 February 1992\nDear Adam,\nAfter reading the plethora of\ncriticism received over the Grease\nreview, Rock Soc's bad press and\nthe performance of the Print Unit,\nI finally feel compelled to write.\nIt is amusing to see Tim Proctor\ncommending you on your defence\nof editorial freedom when he was\none of those involved in the removal\nof Felix 924 and the subsequent\ncensorship that this act caused. The\nreview of Grease that sparked off\nthe affair did perhaps play too much\nattention to money matters and did\nuse this as a yard stick by which to\njudge the performance. However,\nas reviews go, it did seem\nreasonable. Even on the last night\nCollege in all their areas of\nresponsibility. If this ability is\nremoved then its merits are shot to\npieces and nought that is said within\nits pages would have any import\nwhatsoever. 'Wallowing in our own.\nego' is not a pastime in which Felix\nindulges, it is merely proud of its\nown ranking within the student\nnewspaper species.\nA.D. Ham's RockSoc complaints\ndo score a few points, but only a few. Poddy, the Music Editor, is\nnot famed for his to le rence on any\nfront, but he does at least have the\nget up and go to provide a section\nthat appeals to many readers. Indie\nand rave music reviews do make up\nthe majority of work covered only\nthe sound was a little dod gy and the because nobody from Rock Soc, or\nLetters Page Extension\nIn an open\nletter, Chris\nStapleton, last\nyear's Union\nPrint Unit\nManager, gives\nhis point of view\non the issues\nsurrounding the\ncurrent Felix\nPrint Unit\ndebate\nguys were outperformed by the girls\nwith the exe pti on of Rodger (aka\nEd). The set was superb and the\nmusic good. One thing I have\nalways wanted in Felix is previews\nof events so that I can judge whether\nsomething is worth going to. Not\nreviews that tell me how bad it was\nonce I had seen it. In this case I did\ngo, I enjoyed the performance and\nas far as I am aware, relatively few\ntickets needed to be sold to sell out\non Friday and Saturday nights.\nCertainly not enough to warrant the\nridiculous action of censoring Felix\nin such a way. If the finances at\nstake were of such great importance\nthen the Union, CC Us, and\nsocieties involved in backing it were\nidiots to have taken such a gamble.\nAs mentioned in Chris\nSweeting's letter of this week, Felix\ndoes try to 'inform and encourage\nstudent opinion'. However, if Felix\nwas to lie about the quality of such\nan event, especially of Union\norigin, then people would soon\nlearn to ignore such intellectually\noffensive plugs. The independence\nof Felix is there to comment and\ninform students and staff about the\nperformance of the Union and\nthat scene, can be arse d to take the\ninitiative and start writing for Felix.\nSomething that is ALWAYS welcomed along with proof readers\n(pedantic g it). As final comments\non this particular debacle, adverts\non the whole are paid for, press\nreleases are usually so uninformative as not to warrant entry\nin their basic form. If you want to\npublicise any event without\ncomment then submit a 'What's On'\nentry or Small Ad.\nBack now to Mr Proctor. The\nprint unit has grown in size since\nfirst formed by and for Felix. It has\nsteadily increased its productivity\nand this has enabled work other\nthan Felix to be done. But it is still\nan amateur body despite the two full\ntime professionals it employs (the\nprinter and typesetter) and as such\nrelies on the ethos of self help\nwherever possible. The print unit\nendeavours to print as much\nmaterial as possible for the Union\nand its clubs and societies, an\nimmense task as I hope you are\naware when only one printer and\npress is available on two and a half\nto three days a week. The pressure\nof work last year led to a massive\namount of overtime being built up\nby Andy the printer and myself, far\ntoo often I worked 100 hours a week (in a normal week about 70\nhours!), trying to catch up with\nexcess printing work. As a result I often suffered severe exhaustion\nand our printer almost resigned on\na number of occasions.\nIn view of the above I fully\nrespect, and lay no blame on, this\nyear's Print Unit Manager and Felix\nEditor, Adam, for not learning to\nprint. Andy has again built up a large amount of overtime due to\ndemand. The Union has a policy of\nnot paying overtime as wages and\nforces time in lieu as the only\noption. Andy needs time off and\nthoroughly deserves it for his effort\nand patience. This fact has meant\nthat he is likely to be working a three day week for the the\nfor see able future. Based on this\ninformation try planning the\nprinting of Felix (2 to 2 Vi days) and\nall the other work asked for\n(Guildsheet, IndSoc News, Union\nletterheads, invoices, business\ncards, leaflets, posters, clubs and\nsocieties publicity, etc etc). It just\ncan't be done. Also, although\nbooking things months in advance\nhelps it cannot always be\nguaranteed due to any number of\nunforeseen circumstances. People\ndo not turn up with artwork on\ntime, machines fail or external work\nis booked that cannot be shifted to\nanother slot. If a slot is missed it can\nbe several months before another\none becomes available.\nBut what about the photocopier?\nLast year we found out that the\nservicing company had gone into\nliquidation leaving us high and dry.\nThe machine soldiered on with\nmuch time spent on it by myself and\nFelix staff until mid November last\nyear. To fix it now will probably\ncost in the region of \u00a31000 and\nwhether this will be recouped,\nincluding further regular servicing,\nis doubtful. Perhaps the union and\nCC Us would be prepared to\nunderwrite this operation. To date\nwe have worked in excess of 150\nman hours on the problem and spent\nin the region of \u00a32000 in attempts\nto renew this service to the student\nbody.\nAfter noting the above\ninformation that you so obviously\nlack, Mr Proctor et al, I conclude\nthe basic, but severe, problem is\nignorance of the situation. If you,\nor anyone else for that matter, have\nany complaints about Felix or the\nPrint Unit come into the office at\na sensible time (not when Felix is\nin full swing, or when the Editor is\nshattered after finishing it) and\ndiscuss problems without biting\npeoples heads off.\nChris Stapleton, ICU Print Unit\nManager 1990/91.\n\u2014 8 \u2014\n\n"

Since each team comprises\nof 6 players, this allows there to be\n2 substitutes (yes I did pass my CSE\nmaths!). During the game, the subs\ncan rotate as often as a team desires.\nI expect approximately 16 teams\nto enter the event. Thus the first\nphase of the tournament will\ninvolve the teams being split up into\ngroups of four. Within each group,\nall the teams will play each other\nonce. 3 points shall be awarded for\na win, 1 for a draw and none for\na loss. The two teams with the most\npoints in each group will then\nqualifier for a knock-out phase. If\ntwo teams have a similar number of\npoints, the criteria used to\nadjudicate which team goes forward\nto the next round shall be the goal\ndifference, goals scored and goals\nconceded.\nFor the knock-out stage, the draw\nshall be made according to the\ncriteria shown in the table adjacent.\nEventually, this will lead to one\nteam winning the tournament.

There is also the\npossibility, pending the outcome of\nwhether the Nat West Bank is\nwilling to sponsor the event, of cash\nprizes. (Read next weeks issue of\nFelix, to see if the winning\nclub/society can win \u00a3500.)\nThe body set up to organise the\ncompetition is known as IC 1ST; it's basically comprises of myself\nand Gunny Dhadyalla, the OSC\nSports Officer. To enter the\ntournament all you have to do is get\ntogether a maximum of 6 friends\nfrom your favourite society or club,\nscribble their names onto a piece of\npaper, and then give it to either\nmyself, here at Felix, or to Gunny.\nPlease note that there is a \u00a35\nentrance fee which the society/club\nyou are representing should, in\ntheory, pay for. Once you have\nentered, you'll get a full list of the\nrules for the tournament.\nThe deadline for entry is 5pm this\ncoming Monday, 24th February.\nNo entries will be allowed after this\ntime, no matter how big the bribe\n(well actually...). Immediately after\nthe deadline, the draw shall be made\nin the Felix office, after which the\nresulting fixtures shall be\nannounced.
