    "content": "10 COLLEGE HIERARCHY FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH Could you define for me what your job as\nDirector of Personnel entails?\nProviding a service to those who wish to appoint\npeople. From approval of the post right through to\nissuing a contract and supporting departments in\ntheir relationships with their staff. Developing\nCollege policy and strategy to make sure that the\nCollege remains competitive in the job market.\nHow long have you been at IC in your current\nposition? What was your previous job?\nI have been here for 13 months, and before this\nI was the Executive Dean of the NHLI (she was in\nfavour of the merger, seeing it as an opportunity\nfor a good alliance).\nWhat was your first job, how much were you\npaid and how long did you hold it?\nMy first job was as a mathematics lecturer at\nGoldsmith's College on a salary of \u00a31,016 pa, a fortune in those days. I went on to become the head\nof department, then the Dean of Science and\nMathematics. I was there for 20 years. As a stu-dent, I did all the traditional student vacation jobs:\nworking in a laundry, doing the Christmas Post.\nDf Marion Kimbertey\n> s; \u00abr arch y mtn| Body\neel or j Deputy Rectors\n_J Directors\nff l Ei Or Rodney Eastwood\n* _J Ion Caldwell\n* _J Lynda Davies\n< _J Mike Hansen\nJ Vernon McClure\nMttl of r>t* u \u00abr1 \u00abH homes and two grandchildren.\nWhich do you prefer - doughnuts with jam or\ndoughnuts with holes?\nWith Jam, I suppose, though I don't have a particularly sweet tooth. I suppose the sharp taste of\nthe jam, I like sharp jam, it contrasts with the puffiness of the pastry.\nWhat was the last book you read?\nAlan Bennett's Writing Home. I tend to have\nthe real Dr Marion Kimberley\nplease step forward...\nSabbaticals from Kings to remove the ULU post\nof Womens' Officer?\nThe problem is that there are arguments both\nways. There is a plus side to positive disc rim in a tion, yet we don't want to disadvantage half the\npopulation. It would be better if there was an equal\nops officer rather than just a womens' officer.\nHow will the new Asylum and Immigration Act\naffect your work?\nOn an operational level, it means that we will\nhave to be a bit more intrusive into peoples lives,\nand personally, I don't like that. Other than that, it\nis highly unlikely to affect anyone employed by\nIC.\nWhere were you born and brought up?\nBournemouth\nWhere did you go to university? What did you\nread?\nWestfield College, in the University of London\nwhere I read maths, and also my Doctorate.\nWho has had the biggest influence on your life?\nMy mother and father for their strong principles:\nhonesty, hard work and fairness. My parents were\nunusual for their generation, they had a forward\nlooking approach to things and they were very\nopen especially about things like sex.\nWhat do you do in your spare time?\nHaven't got any at the moment. I used to sing in\na choir and go to concerts, the theatre, cinema and\naerobics, before my husband died we used to go\nWhat do think of the recent attempt by the dinghy sailing. Children: one at uni, two with\nOne summer I even worked in a Max Factor factory - it gave me a headache. Oh, and when I was 14\nI played the piano for ballet classes.\nDo you enjoy working here? What are the challenges that face you?\nYes, though there is too much work to do. I have\nspent this year restructuring the division to make it\neasy. The expectations for the senior staff are onerous though once my division is restructured the\nworkload should be more reasonable. I have 33\nstaff in my division which will increase by a third\nafter the mergers.\nHas you role within College changed while you\nhave been here?\nIt has changed much yet! I have spent the whole\nyear analysing what the division does, what\nCollege does. The current workload means that\n'fire-fighting' dominates my day.\nWhen, if ever, you leave here, what would you\nlike to be remembered for?\nI would like to be remembered for having made\na difference for the benefit of people. I would like\nto see a balanced esteem given to others, that is\nstaff other than academic staff. Also the imbalance\nof women at the senior level should be resolved. IC\nshould be more progressive on women's representation. Does this make it more difficult working here?\nNot really, I have spent all my life working in\nthis sort of environment.\nfive on the go at once and fall asleep reading one\nof them.\nWhat is your favourite book?\nI don't have a favourite and I don't like thrillers,\nbut I do like a mystery with a good plot. Hold on,\nI 've just thought of my favourite, it's Testament of\nYouth by Vera Britten.\nCould describe an anecdote typical of you time\nas a student.\nI can remember three things that stand out from\nmy time as a student. When I was at Westfield\nCollege, in Hampstead, we had to wear gowns to\nlectures. We had to cross from our halls and I can't tell you how many times I impaled my gown on a door handle.\nSecondly, when we had fire drills in these hous-es, we were hoisted out of the upper story window\nin a canvas seat.\nLastly, when the Queen came to open the new\nscience department, the local authority spent several days repainting the local bins and road mark-in gs.I found it amazing that they thought that the\nQueen couldn't handle seeing a bit of dirt.\nAre you a monarchist?\nNo, I am against any form of hereditary system.\nSuccinctly as possible, how would you describe\ntoday's students?\nThe very nature of my job means that I don't come across student's very often, only in lifts! The\nstudent I know best is my daughter who is bright,\nresponsible and nice to know, and I assume\nImperial College students are the same.\n\n"

The post of President\nwas won by New Election (aka Re-Open Nominations).\nEDWARD SHIRMAN\nThe most outstanding feature of this\nyear's sabbatical elections was the\n40% increase in turnout over the\n1996 results. Almost four hundred\nextra South Kensington students\nvoted, marginal ising the St Mary's vote, which stayed static at just under\nthree hundred, from one third to one\nquarter of the total votes cast.\nWhile their influence on the\nresults decreased significantly, the\nmedics ballot papers were instrumental in getting both of the successful Deputy Presidential candidates\nelected, despite their unpopularity in\nSouth Kensington. Mr Clark's case is\nthe most dramatic since he received\nthe lowest vote of all four candidates\nsouth of Hyde Park, not even managing 20% of the poll. He would have\nbeen the first to be eliminated were it\nnot for the 287 votes that he received\nfrom the Mary's students.\nWith this block vote, Rob Clark\nwas able to lead from the first round\nthrough all three votes, despite\nreceiving slightly less second and\nthird preference votes than Duncan\nTindall. While Mr Clark received a total of 92 transfers from John\nSavery and New Election, Mr\nTindall's101 transfers were not\nenough to trouble the Mary's vote.\nThe latter achieved the highest percentage vote of any of the candidates\nfrom a single ballot box, when\nalmost 80% of the Civil Engineering\nvoters came out in his favour.\nThe medical influence on the\nDeputy President (Clubs &\nSocieties) election was even more\nmarked as the winning candidate\nreceived the lowest South Ken. vote\nof all three candidates, but was saved\nby 285 votes from the northerners.\nSmita Chaturvedi eventually\nsqueezed home despite losing out 2:1\non the New Election transfers to\nSarah Thomas.\nWhile the election of Felix Editor\nwas considerably more consensual,\nJeremy Thomson would not have\nbeen successful if St Mary's had\nvoted against him. The sole candidate received over 60% of the South\nKensington votes but the 279 medical votes could have scuppered his\nhopes.\nThe Presidential race was the only\nclear cut decision, with a phenomenal 802 votes being cast in South\nKensington for New Election. With\nSam Baker receiving a derisory 124\nfirst preferences, even the medics\ncould not have saved her from\ndefeat.\nConsidering the results on a box\nby box basis, the most notable\nchange was the extra 100 students\nwho voted in Huxley. This group\nincreased from their previous 120\nvotes to become the largest South\nKensington group with over 220\nexpressing their views. Elsewhere an\nextra 60 voted in Electrical\nEngineering, an extra 40 in the Royal\nSchool of Mines and another 40\nextra in Civil Engineering. With 11\nballot boxes this year, one more than\nlast year, the shared polling station\nbetween Blackett and Chemical\nEngineering netted 70 more votes.\nNotably if the elections had been\ncarried out in a manner similar to the\nUS Senate Elections some rather different results would have been pro-duce d. Leaving aside Silwood and\nthe NHLI, Sarah Thomas topped the\npoles in six departments, New\nElection in three and Smita\nChaturvedi in just two. Duncan\nTindall did even better, coming first\nin six areas, New Election did so in\ntwo with John Savery and Rob Clark\ngaining one each. Jeremy Thomson\nwas only beaten in one of the balloting areas, with the JCR coming out\nin favour of New Election. The\nPresidential race was as clear cut as\never under this system, with Sam\nBaker failing to top the poll in any\ndepartment.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH COLUMNS 11\nSince this article is well behind\nschedule, I am able to pass comment\non the Election results. Not Wirral\nSouth (allow a man his private grief)\nbut our own little shindig. All in all,\nyou, for the most part, voted sens i bly. Congratulations to Smita, Rob\nAnd Jeremy, whom I know will do a sterling job next year. As for the\nPresidency, the result was hugely\nrelieving. I have now seen four cam-pa ign s, and this has been without\ndoubt the most pathetic. The two\ncandidates (I suppose that should be\nthree, including New Election, who\nbehaved impeccably throughout) left\nus in doubt that they were running for\nno other reason than to shore up\ndecidedly soggy CVs.\nSuggestions to turn ICU into a brothel, for example, are fine as\nslightly jokey asides, but in the\nabsence of any real ideas and prop os als, one is left feeling that this is a major plank of the manifesto. In the\nlight of this and other examples of\noutright stupidity, mitigated only by\none of the candidates having the\ngood sense to throw in the towel, it is\nhardly surprising that New Election\nwon by a landslide. IC does not have\nthe most sophisticated electorate in\nthe world (witness the pathetic herd\ninstinct at Mary's), but to suggest\nthat Felix unfairly coaxed students\ninto voting this way \u2014 . T>1 is laughable. As one Mm on baker\nof the great philosophers once said, we may\nbe daft, but we're not\nstupid.\ncame as a surprise to me. Full marks\nfor your devastating honesty, Mike,\nsaying that you are not particularly\nworried about waste\nin your department.\nYou can say that\ngain, as I suggested on\nthe back of the page\nthat had your inter-view. If your con-Last week'\nFelix was\njammed packed with\nbits worthy of\nmention. The\npiece on the\nMonarchy is 1\nnot one of 1\nthese. Rarely\nhave I seen such\ncontemptuous i informed, hysteric a drivel on the pages of\nthis esteemed publica-tion. Life is too short\nto waste time \\ / Q j \u00a3g QfWQQ.SOXI 'e aC* \u00b0^m^ esteem ec' science is completely clear on\nthe efficiency\nfront, someone\nin your department is concealing a lot\nfrom you.\nThe piece on\nc com mod ation is very interest-ing. Since there\nwere few rich pickings in the SCR this\nweek, I followed the\nresponding to this\nsort of rubbish, particularly given\nthat the moron that wrote it remained\nanonymous, so I shan't.I loved the\ninterview with Mike Hansen, which\ncolleague Don on\nIC Dystorter and climbed up Queen's Tower to spy the rubbish rustling\naround down below, looking for\nanything useful. I was in luck. Simon\nWistow stated that halls of residence\nsuffered from a crippling lack of\nfunds. This is not strictly true. The\nmoney is there, but Estate's seem\nloathe to spend it. Among the crisp\npackets blowing in the wind, I saw\nsomething that said Estates under-spent on residence annual maintenance contracts by 53% in the year to\n31st July 1996. Mr Wistow and his\ninvestigators will be delighted to\nhear that this is not afflicting all\nwalks of College life; \u00a3164,500 was\nspent when Suite Five was beautified. As of the 31st September 1996,\nthere was \u00a31.2 million in the residences long term maintenance capital account. Also, as I heard in the\nfoyer of Sherfield, 23% of the residences budget goes on cleaning,\nalmost as much as the 31 % spent on\npremises themselves. Given the huge\nnumber of cleaners I remember from\nmy days in Linstead, this does not\nsurprise me. Bearing in mind that\n14% of the total budget goes on their!\nwages alone, this is an issue which\nmust be tackled. A shortage of cash\nis not the problem. A willingness to\nspend it and spend it wisely is the\nproblem in this case. Plus ga\nchange...\nAfua Osei asks why national voters abandon those who stole their policies for the\nambiguities of the main parties\nThe \"New Election\" result for IC\npresident was a joy to behold; one\ncould only dream about this kind of\nresult happening in the national\narena. Imagine it, the entire British\nelectorate voting \"New Election\"wishful thinking as this option is\nunavailable on national ballot papers.\nHowever the British public could\nstill choose rebellion from the apparently amorphous, indistinguishable\nLabour and Conservative parties in\nfavour of a party who at least have\nthe honesty to give us a defined set of\nabsolute promises of their plans for\npower.\nThis result would dynamically\nshatter the whole foundations of the\nLabour party, as well as totally obliterating the careers of Blair, Brown\nand Harman. Labour would have\nnowhere to turn, it would have sailed\nthe tides of socialism, liberalism, and\nnow left wing conservatism. Labour\nwould be relegated to the political\narchives.\nMeanwhile the bullying\nConservative party whips, courtesy\nof Gorman, Howard and Portillo\nwould grab that party by the horns\n(with the inevitable ousting of John\nMajor) and veer towards the extreme\nright. They would embrace absolute\nextreme free market economics and\nnationalism. They would even have\nthe disastrous, transient flirtation\nwith fascism; alienating the prosperous ethnic business communities\nwho Major has taken pains to woo.\nThey would lose a significant percentage of their loyal business com-m unity, who accept total British cooperation in European integration as\na painful necessity, if London is to\nbecome the financial centre of\nEurope.\nAmongst others, the Liberal\nDemocrats are at present attempting\nto force themselves into this mould,\nwith their pledge of a lp increase in\nincome tax simultaneously destroying their electoral chances and marking them out as the one major party\nto offer a realistic, believable mani-fes to. At the same time, the Scots and\nWelsh Nationalists, and even Jimmy\nGoldsmith's bunch of weirdos, are\nable to pick-up a multitude of voters,\nas their supporters can at least rest\nassured that they know what policies\ntheir vote is mandating. And\nalthough many people would claim\nthat a vote which did not go to a Labour or Conservative candidate\nconstitutes a pointless, worthless\nprotest, surely last Tuesday night has\ntaught us all that if the disenchanted\nand the downhearted band together,\nthen the sum total of their feelings\ncan (and will) be heard.\nLondon Bridge to Waterloo\n(East)\nAcross the river, monsters,\nGiant Godzillas groping.\nFor pride of place in the pile\nThat lives upon an ocean\nOf floating finance food\nFor business suited sharks.\nMoney grows on trees\nIn these 1990's parks.\nThe past is on my side,\nCoronation Street chimneys rising,\nBrown bricked buildings falling down\nLike London Bridge, but hiding\nIn the ancient alleyways,\nGrimey shirted gravel men, Returning home to terraced tears\nThat people wept in 1910.\nSeparate sides of London live,\nAcross the deep and dirty Thames.\nThe rich and poor, the old and new,\nAre both on view from travelling trains.\nAnd as I watch this time warp tell\nA tale of different destinies,\nMy mind is split apart in two\nBy river, time and empathy.\n- -Keith- -If you would like to find out more about PoetIC contact Keith\nMcNulty via k. mcnulty@ic.ac.uk\n\n"

Their exposure to drugs, whether through\ntaking them themselves, or just being around them,\nmeans that many students are plainly indifferent to the\nissues* Derivatives of many hard drugs were openly\nfor sale in chemist's stores last century, and it was\nconsidered a normal social habit by many Victorian\n'genteel' folk. Although the Police generally turn a blind eye to much soft drug taking, the penalties for\ndrug trafficking are naturally harsh, with profits confiscated and possible life sentences for offenders. All\nthis is a world away from the average casual user, with\nmany equating it with normal tobacco smoking. Write\nand tell us you views.\nDrug taking is considered a harmless hobby by many people today,\nand for the most part, with people having the odd spl iff at parties, it is\nrelatively innocuous. Few people would doubt that the harder stuff is\ndangerous to your health and is known to be addictive. Only a tiny\nminority of people addicted to heroin or cocaine started out intending\nto be addicts, and a smaller minority of these would not have previously been taking soft drugs.\nThis is the problem with legal ising cannabis or any other soft drug.\nThe question we need to ask is not whether occasional users will be\nharmed if they only stay on comparatively safe drugs (although they\nare all far more dangerous and addictive than tobacco and alcohol),\nbul whether a change in the law v v ill actually be of any help to any-one. It won't,; the law is the there to protect people. If it is compromised by legal ising soft drugs, the public will consider them safe and\nusage would sky-rocket.\nMore people would naturally move onto harder drugs, providing\nthe drug-dealers with just as much, if not more profit than they were\nmaking already. This is certainly the case in the Netherlands, with\nmany of the original proponents of Europe's most relaxed drugs laws\nregretting their decision due to the increase in drug trafficking, and\nhard drug usage. Heroin addicts often share needles, transmitting a plethora of diseases, including AIDS. Would the taxpayer have to provide for fresh needles and other equipment to prepare these cocktails\nof doom? The legal is ation of narcotic substances compromises the\nessence of society and family values- and is another step down the\npath so disintegration.\nIS DRUG PR0HIWI0U OUTDATED?'\nIn America, pharmacies are called drugstores. This is of course,\nexactly w hat they are. They sell drugs of various kinds to people\nto help with ailments or as an important part of their treatment.\nRecreational drugs are no different and often less dangerous than\ntheir medical counterparts.\nDrugs have been taken by people since the Stone Age. and it\nis only because many of them are now banned that all the criminal problems associated with them: gang warfare, murder, cor-rup tion, and prostitution have proliferated. Were drugs to be\nlegal is ed, it could be controlled by high taxation, hence bring\nextra revenue for the Government.\nDrugs could be properly marketed and packaged, with suitable\ngovernment warnings and age limits. Advertising could be\nrestrained under the same rules as cigarettes, given that they kill\nfar more people with cancer, emphysema and heart attacks. It is\nnot surprising, given the stresses of modern life, that more and\nmore people take drugs as solace. It is not only the young or\n\"delinquents' that take drugs: it is a fashionable habit among\nmany highly-paid city traders.\nAre we to penal is e such a section of our population, whose\nonly crime was to indulge in a personal habit. Surely it is a question of liberty.\n<PRo\nAMTI>\n\n"

    "content": "6 NEWS FEATURE FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH Long-term problems; Short-term goals\nKAIZEN\nThere are three major problems with\nnationalised industries. During the\n80s, gas, water and electricity all\nneeded quite desperate cash injections. They were known for their\ninefficient work practices and in\nmost cases a very poor customer service was provided even when there\nwas a great demand for their prod-uc ts. The government of course had\nthe solution - Privatisation.\nTo get investment in the system\nthat prevailed under the Tories one\nhad to approach the Treasury - a body not known for saying yes. The\nTreasury of course feared that by\nappearing to shell out they would be\nsub sidi sing and promote in eff ici en cy. Thus the water industry had\nVictorian drains that leaked and BT\nhad exchanges liable to failure. In the\npresent day, London Underground\nhave stations and trains in need of\nreplacement. The state of the system\nafter years of neglect was the main\npush to sell. Get industry to pay for\nthe investment which the government wouldn't pay for with our taxes\nwhile at the same time making\nmoney to pay for the next round of\ntax cuts. The real difference of course\nwas to remove the treasury from the\nequation and the culture of under\ninvestment that prevailed.\nWith privatisation, BT' 5 and the\nelectricity generators over manning\nlevels were brutally exposed. \"The\nholiday camp atmosphere that was\ncharacteristic of a nationalised company disappeared\" said the minister\nresponsible for privatisation. The old\ninefficient management was\nremoved to be replaced by apr ogres sive, business orientated management which had to be brought in; in\norder to privat is e the industry.\nSomething that was possible where\never the profits were to be directed.\nOnce again the real change was a change in culture.\nThe last reason for privatisation\nlies in the introduction of competition in what is a monopolistic mar-ket. Competition is said to promote\nan increase in consumer service and\nvalue for money. This is essentially\nimpossible for most of the cases\nmentioned above, where you can\nonly have one gas pipe to your house.\nEven for BT it has had limited success where the only serious contender has slowly been forced out of\nthe market. Only for national or international calls have other market contenders found market share.\nThere is nothing about a nationalised industry that prevents it\nbecoming efficient. It is up to the\npeople at the top to see that this is\ndone. The vast number of column\ninches recently devoted to Tory\nslee ze surely indicate that their minds\nwere on making as much money for\nthemselves as possible. An efficiently run business can pay for its own\ninvestment program. Sometimes,\nexternal investment is required but\nwith a mature relationship with the\ntreasury taking a long term view to\ncut costs there is no reason why this\ncannot be achieved. The Post Office\nis very successful making vast profits\nfor this countries tax payers. With a co- operative relationship with its\nunions it is able to maintain wage\ncosts at industry levels while still\nremaining competitive, branching\nout into new product areas and\ninvesting in new cost conscious tech-no logie s. Other than to provide seats on the\nboards of newly privatised companies for de selected ministers,\n(Norman Lamont has already been\noffered a seat on the board of British\nGas). This is beginning the question,\nwhy privat is e? The role of the government should be more as a change\nagent - an efficient leader looking to\nprovide an efficient service to its\nshareholders. At the moment the crux\nof political debate is purely in ideo lo gies. A government should also be\njudged on how well it runs the companies it is responsible for. However\nthis seems to be lost on the press at\nthis moment, clam our ing to shout\nthat 'Just look at how bad nationalised industry is and how badly run\nit is', also 'Nationalised industry is a bad investment'. There is no truth in\nthis sound bite, its inefficiency due to\nthe under management, it left to rot\nuntil the costs of not doing anything\nabout it become too great. The present governments policy is top gain\ncost effectiveness by cutting costs -and let the service live with it. If the\nfinancial cuts are not properly won\nwith efficiency gains then it will\ninevitably lead to a drop in consumer\nservice. Government should be at the\nheart of business, promoting and carrying through change.\nAs an aside.... Closer to home\nand smaller scale, almost the same\nthing is about to happen in our own\ncollege. No such problems exist in\nour efficient, well run book shop.\nSince Sherfield had handed over control of the loss making business to the\nunion, it has been turned around to a business which made over \u00a350,000\nfor union clubs. This year it is set to\nmore than double this figure. Just as\nthis happens, a Sheffield initiative\ndetermined that it would be even\nmore profitable for the shop to be\ntendered out. This with no consultation and no guarantee that there\nwould be ANY money forthcoming\nfor our union. Where the efficiency\ngains are to be made come from\nundercutting our own second hand\nbookstore and using our own internet\nprovider. This action by s her field seems only intent on redirecting the\nprofits from our clubs to itself to help\nfund its own \u00a3100m pa level of\nbureaucracy. Protect our union and\nprotect our bookstore.\n\n"

    "content": "4 NEWS FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH Birkbeck closes physics\nJEREMY CLARKE The closure of the Physics department at Birkbeck College is imminent according to Michael de\nPodesta, one of the lecturers in\nphysics. Birkbeck College, a college-of the University of London, is primarily a night-school who's long-term future is uncertain due to its\nlack of funding.\nThe total spending of Birkbeck is\napproximately \u00a333 m of which\naround \u00a320m is spent on the academic departments and the rest on overheads including the administration,\nregistry and various publications.\nProjections of the College's budget\nindicate that without the Physics\ndepartment, Birkbeck will break\neven next academic year, but will be\nin debt from then onwards with an\nestimated debt of \u00a32m by the year\n2000. One member of staff stated the\nfeeling in the physics department\nwas one of \"despondency\".\nThe shortfall in funding is mainly\ncaused by an increase in expenditure\nfrom academic salaries without a corresponding increase in funding.\nAt present the department costs an\nestimated \u00a3lm to run each year, but\nonly \u00a3500,000 is available to fund it.\nFurther cuts are to be made by amalgamating several departments. Of the\n8 academic staff in the department,\nUCL proposes to take on four, the\nremainder are to be laid off. The four\nstaff are likely to move into the new\nCondensed Matter group at UCL.\nThe academic board has recently\nrecommended the closure of the\nphysics department as long as there\nare \"sufficient safeguards for student\ninterests\". However, it is the responsibility of the governors to finally\ndecide whether the department is to\ngo, but this is expected to be a for-mali ty. Despite the problems involved, the\noutlook for the students is less seri-o us. University College, which\nalready works closely with Birkbeck\nhas agreed to take over the present\nundergraduates, offering a two-streamed approach to the physics\ncourses, with new Birkbeck students\nessentially following the UCL physics courses. Current second and\nthird years will be able to continue\ntheir present courses, but the first\nwill be required to change their\napproach. It is not clear where, in\nfuture, the lectures will take place,\nand the viability of science at\nBirkbeck is in serious doubt.\nBirkbeck College offers a unique\nplace in the University of London\nand doubt about its future means\nthere will be a further gap in Higher\nEducation provision. As funding for\ncourses and living costs becoming\never more difficult for students to\nmeet, Birkbeck enables people with\ncommitment to obtain a degree\nwhilst earning their living during the\nday. That Birkbeck has no firm\nassurance of a future implies that\neven fewer students will be able to\nobtain a degree and the shortage of\nsuitably-trained graduates in the\nworkplace will become even more\nacute.\nExam policy\naired\nNEWS TEAM It has been confirmed this week that\nstudents will be represented on\nCollege committees which consider\nexamination policies. Past complaints over the introduction of a College wide calculator policy has\nled to acceptance that student reps\nmust have input on these matters.\nMr Vernon McClure, Academic\nRegistrar, explained to Felix that in\naccordance with the continuing delegation of powers from the\nUniversity of London to IC, the two\nold Examinations Committees are\nbeing disbanded. They last met in\nNovember and with their imminent\ndeparture they will never have had\nstudent involvement.\nMr McClure insisted that \"they\nare University of London committees and there is no provision in the\napproved constitution of each for\nstudent membership.\" The examining committees' work is due to be\ntaken over by the existing\nEngineering Studies Committee and\nScience Studies Committee, both of\nwhom will continue to have a significant student presence.\nFinal confirmation of the examination committee changes will be\ntaken at the Board of Studies meeting on the 18 June.\nSouthside barred\nKELLY ROBINSON\nRegular patrons of Southside Bar\nwho were dismayed to find their\nusual haunt closed last weekend will\nbe relieved to learn that the bar\nshould be back on stream by Friday.\nThe bar was forced to close last\nweekend, during what is usually their\nbusiest period, whilst contractors\ncarried out emergency work to meet\nLicensing Authority standards. An\nAuthority safety officer, who visited\nthe premises on 27th February, ruled\nrecent building works illegal and\ndemanded the bar close immediately.\nHis decision came after refurbishments to Southside basement in\npreparation for the new health centre\ncaused an alteration to the bar's emergency exit. This route would\nhave meant students crossing the\ntraining room, a plan which the\ninspector felt involved unnecessary\nrisk.\nWhilst the changed route had\nrecently been approved by the\nDistrict Surveyor, the licensing official disagreed and also stipulated that\na door leading to a set of stairs,\nwhich formed an integral part of the\nescape route, was too narrow.\nIan Frame, Imperial College's Projects Manager, spoke to the contractors working on the new medical\ncentre and an alternative route was\ndevised. According to Mr Frame all\ninvolved, including Ian Caldwell, are\n\"a lot happier with the new route.\"\nHe further commented that \"It will\nsimply involve people walking\nstraight up the stairs and out of the\nbuilding, allowing no confusion.\"\nTo make way for this diversion an\nexisting wall had to be knocked\nthrough. If this wall had been a parti-tion, the building work would have\nbeen finished in time for Friday night\nopening. However, the wall proved\nto be constructed from solid concrete\nand so the premises remained closed\nuntil Sunday evening.\nMr Roger Pownall, Southside Bars\nManager was unavailable for comment as Felix went to press.\nNews in Brief\nIMPERIAL TOTTY?\nAccording to Cosmopolitan magazine \"Imperial College is Britain's ideal courting campus\" with 71.4%\nmales. The article includes a map\nshowing places that provide supreme\nmeeting/matching/mating op port uni ties. What they don't take into\naccount is the quality of the male\nspecimen. One female IC student\ncommented, \"We have quantity, but\nquality - well, that's debatable. The\nCosmo article was obviously penned\nby someone who hasn't been to the\ncampus to see the sorry state of\naffairs.\"\nR CSU ELECTIONS\nAmongst a set of immaterial votes\nfor uncontested RCSU Executive\nCommittee posts, the contest for\nRoyal College of Science President\nstood out as the only ballot with a majority of less than 140. The effect\nof single-transferable voting was\ndemonstrated to the full when Karl\nStand turned an eight vote deficit to\nCharlie Joynt into a five vote majority in the second round. First round\ntotals of 132 for Joynt and 124 for\nStand became 135 and 140 votes\nrespectively on the second count.,\nwhen the 39 counts for New Election\nwere redistributed. This pushed Mr\nStand two votes past the 138 quota\nnecessary for victory. Returning\nOfficer Duncan Robertson described\nthe turnaround as \"One of the most\nsurprising results I 've ever seen\".\nElsewhere, first years Poppy\nBuxton and Mo Mansoori took landslide victories as Academic Affairs\nOfficer and Honorary Secretary\nrespectively. Nick Swain took 214\nout of 295 votes cast to be re-elected\nas Honorary Junior Treasurer for\n97/98, and Rob Park and Eric\nWratten combined to take the post of\nRCS Vice-President by an overwhelming majority of 186. However,\nwith all these posts uncontested and\nnone of the candidates expressing\nextremist opinions, the victors were\nnever in doubt.\n\n"

Jeremy Thomson was\nelected as Felix Editor (and Print\nUnit Manager) with the help of St\nMary's votes, despite suffering at the\nhands of the well organised New\nElection campaign.\nThe two candidates for DP(C&S) proved to be the most conciliatory of\nall, with Sarah Thomas insisting that\nher opposing candidate would prove\nsuccessful. Smita was almost speechless after her victory, saying \"I'm very happy\" and that she was \"going\nstraight to bed now, I'm very tired.\"\nChris Ince, SCC Chair and senior\nmember of the Elections Committee,\nspoke to Felix about the appeal from\nSam Baker saying that it was \"under\nconsideration.\" He went on to say\nthat \"the points that it made will\nprobably come up in Council next\nTuesday\" and that it would \"Sam\nmade it quite clear that she had no\nobjection to how the results went this\nyear.\"\nThe New Election campaign itself\nhas come under scrutiny with allegations that its budget was never\napproved by ICU Council, the practice of previous elections (Felix\n1018). There has been no official\nstatement as to how much money the\nNew Election campaign has spent.\nSarah Thomas, who is also ICU\nCouncil Chair, denies that the expenditure of Union money was approved\nby Council.\nNomination papers for the position\nof President will be posted at the\nbeginning of next term.\nfull results and analysis, page 2\nBomb Squad defuses Queen's Lawn hoax\nMARIA IOANNOU\nA bomb scare disrupted Wednesday\nlunchtime when a parcel, believed to\nhave been an explosive device, was\nplaced on the front desk of the\nSherfield Security reception. The\nincident, described later as a \"silly\nstudent prank\", necessitated the\nmobil is ation of the Bomb Squad.\nThe drama began when at 1.25pm when a student, claiming that a man\nin Queens Gate had given him \u00a310\nto deliver the parcel to Security,\ndeposited the item together with a \"special message of apology\". The\ncircumstances were enough to raise\nthe suspicions of the security guards\nas this ploy is known to be typical\nterrorist tactic. There were fears that\na former Northern Ireland Minister,\nvisiting College at the time, might be\nin danger.\nThe parcel was \"extremely heavy\nfor an item of that size\" said Ken\nWeir, Deputy Head of Security,\nwhich further heightened his anxiety.\nMr Weir went on to say that \"It was\na plastic bag with a vinyl case inside\nand a handle sticking out of the top, I wasn't about to open it.\"\nrat\n\u2022 f11 PHOTO: ALDOUS Security in action! Local Police, Imperial College Security Officers and\nthe Bomb Squad acting in concert to defuse a bomb hoax.\nActing quickly and efficiently,\nTerry Sweeney, who just last week\nrevived an inebriated student when\nhe stopped breathing, picked up the\npackage and moved it to the doorstep\nof the Sherfield exit facing the\nQueens Lawn. With remarkable\npresence of mind Ken Weir, worried\nthat the package might explode,\nmoved it to the centre of Queens\nLawn. Fortunately there were several\npolice officers on campus bar coding bicycles and after a quick discussion,\nPC Clive Coleman called the Bomb\nSquad.\nWhen the team of experts arrived\nthey cordoned off the Queens Lawn\narea and evacuated students from the\nvicinity. The windowed areas of the\nbuildings adjacent to the lawn had\nalready been cleared at the orders\nKeith Reynolds, Head Security, with\nthe help of Ken Weir and the\nEmergency Response Team. The\nBomb Squad then proceeded to\nexamine the parcel and needed two\nX rays to fully ascertain the object's nature.\nComing to the conclusion that the\nparcel was in fact an inoffensive article the team decided to open it.\nInside they found an over head projector that had been stolen last Friday\nduring ICU International Night from\nthe office of Ian Gillet, IC Safety\nOfficer.\nSecurity notified students of the all\nclear and staff were allowed to reenter their buildings at 2.14 pm after\nnearly an hour. A fatigued Mr Weir\nexpressed his disdain saying \"It\nseems to have been a silly student\nprank ... which has caused a major\nincident and wasted large amounts of\npolice time and money.\" The local\nconstabulary have asked IC Security\nto aid them in their search for those\nbehind the incident. Criminal charges\nfor wasting police time are being\nconsidered.\n\n"

    "content": "FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH LETTERS & NOTICES 13\nLetters to Felix\nart societies\nDear Felix,\nWith a hint of amusement and a large helping of shock I read the\ninterview with Smita Chaturvedi. I feel it necessary to educate the new\nD.P.( Clubs and Societies) elect of\nthe actual size of the art societies\nwithin in Imperial College Union.\nTo dismiss the \"art societies\" as\nboth small and withdrawn, highlights\nthe candidate's naivety and arrogance with respect to the Clubs and\nSocieties of the Imperial College\nUnion.\nIn order to give some idea of the\nerror made in dismissing \"they\" (art\nsocieties) as small, I would like to\npoint out that one such society,\nArtSoc with 200 members each year,\nhas one of the largest, if not the\nlargest membership base of any club\nor society within the Imperial\nCollege Union.\nFinally, a big hint!! This is a recommendation to all the potential\nSabbs; talk to the \"ARTS Societies\"\nbefore dictating what you think they\nneed.\nYours most artistically,\nLucie Purcell\nArtSoc Chair\nSftW attacked\nDear Felix,\nI am writing to ask why the first\npage of the review of Mars Attacks!\nin Something For The Weekend last\nweek, gave away the entire plot of\nthe film. This totally spoiled my\nenjoyment when I went to see the\nfilm last weekend. In my opinion a review should tell the reader generally what the film is about and whether,\nin the opinion of the reviewer, it is\nany good. It should leave the reader\nto find out most of the plot when they\nsee the film, especially the ending!\nP. Hickman (chem 2)\nfinance figures\nDear Felix,\nI am able to report that Clark Kent\nis not the Director of Finance of the\nUniversity of Nottingham.\nI have checked and on a comparable basis they have 60 staff in their\nFinance function which compares\nwith 78 in ours. Given the difference\nin the sizes of the organisations I reckon that puts us on a par.\nAlthough we are always trying to\nimprove our effectiveness, the Simon\nBaker statistic of last week is I am\nafraid a Benchmark Too Far.\nBest wishes,\nMike Hansen\nDirector of Finance\nlicensing laws\nDear Felix,\nThis letter is to clear up any\nrumours that may be flying around,\nafter the early closure of the bar in\nthe Union on Friday night. The\nUnion bars currently operate on\nSpecial Order Exemptions, which the\nlocal licensing authorities issue at\ntheir own discretion. Last Friday,\nthey decided only to issue a bar\nextension until 12:30am. Having\nalready obtained the rest of the\nlicenses for the remainder of term,\ncan I assure you that the Union run\nbars will continue to open until lam\non a Friday night, and 2am for the\nEaster Carnival on March 21st. Secondly... Congratulations to\nPOG for getting loads of mileage out\nof a nothing incident at Abandon!\nThe drug issue is one that I have no\nreal strong opinion on, but as the representative of the Union on licensed\npremises, the bottom line is that\ndrugs are illegal and my decision was\ntaken to prevent any action against\nthe Union.\nSpeaking personally, I have no\ninterest in what students do in their\nown homes, but once they jea pardi se the Union's licence (and our ability\nto open to 750 students every Friday\nnight) then I have a duty to act, if\nonly to allow us to continue to open.\nThank you for allowing me the\nopportunity to explain the Union's position.\nMark Home\nEvents and Marketing Manager\nobscene bureaucracy!\nDear Felix,\nA few weeks ago I attended a short\nFirst Aid course, given at this college\nby a visiting speaker. I was rather\nbemused by the appearance, at the\nend of the session, of a great wad of\nforms and questionnaires to be filled\nin, demanding to know, amongst\nother things, my ethnic origin. This is\njust typical of the type of bureaucracy we are up against in IC these days,\nwhich constantly hinders people trying to go about their daily business. I was very annoyed about this, so I decided to make an official complaint about it.\nA little research showed that the\nform originated from the offices of\nCRAP, the college's Committee for\nthe Retardation of Anything Positive,\nsituated on the top floor of the\nSherfield building. I gave them a call,\nbut was promptly told that they\nwould not pay any attention to me\nunless I used the proper procedures\nto state my grievance. They directed\nme to a small, open-fronted shelter\noutside the building, where I was\ninformed that I would have to fill in\nand return, in triplicate, a lengthy\nform called Biennial OfficiallyLicensed Log of Complaints at\nKiosks (Supplement).\nSo I duly photocopied my\nBOLLoCKS and was just waiting in\na queue to get them stamped when I was accosted by a woman from the\nCompletely Overfunded But Bloody\nLousy Environmental Research\nSociety (COBBLERS), who asked\nme to fill in a40 page questionnaire\nabout my attitudes to deforestation. I Didn't Express an Opinion, because\nby this stage I was absolutely fuming\nabout the amount of time I'd spent on\nthis. But she thanked me anyway and\nallowed me on my way.\nWith the completed forms I headed up to the CRAP office to return\nthem. But on arrival I realised that I'd forgotten my damn swipe-card, so I couldn't get in. What's more I had\nalso rather absent-mindedly left\nbehind my driving licence, birth certificate and a photograph of myself\nsigned by a professional person who\nhas known me for at least 24 months,\nso there was no hope.\nIn the end I just had to send the\nthings off in the post. I thought I'd heard the last of the whole business\nuntil yesterday when I received\nthrough my letterbox a Federation of\nUniversities and Colleges Official\nFinalisation Form, telling me that my\ncomplaint had unfortunately not been\nupheld, and that they were very\nsorry. It took me ages to work out\nwhat the hell it was on about as by\nthis stage I had completely forgotten\nthat I had ever made a complaint. In\nthe meantime I thought to myself that\nit's a good job that the Federation\ndon't also represent kindergartens, as\nthat would spell something rather\nrude.\nYours sincerely,\nJames Clarke\nLetters may be edited for length.\nDeadline for letters in Felix 1083\nis Friday 14th March.\nLetters may be e mailed to our\naddress: felix@ic.ac.uk\nPlease note that there is no\nFelix next Friday.\nA special Easter Felix is out\non Wednesday 19th March.\nFelix is produced for and on behalf of Imperial College Union Publications Board.\nPrinted by Imperial College Union Print Unit, Beit Quad, Prince Consort Road,\nLondon SW7 2BB.

    "content": "16 SPORT FELIX FRIDAY7 TH MARCH FELIX SPORT\nMary's sucked dry by vampires\nThe scene is set - one of the oldest\nrugby competition in the world and\nSt. Mary's are in the final, as they\nhave been for the last twenty years\n(having won the thirteen of them).\nThe crowd was hyped and in good\nvoice for the match of the season for\nSt. Mary's, and their opponents\nGuy's and St. Thomas's. Mary's did-n't seem too worried by the vamp i ric habits of the Guy's players especially after the first match of the day, in\nwhich the Mary's Thirds had beat the\nGuy's Thirds in a closely fought 17-14. The match kicked off and Guy's took an early lead with some consecutive penalty kicks, but fly-half\nClifford pulled back with a penalty\nkick. The Guy's fly-half took an\namazing penalty kick from the\nhalfway line with only a slight following wind to put them ahead by a margin of six again.\nHalf an hour into the match and\nJim Piatt scored a beautiful try set up\nby Simon Rogers in a constructive\nrun which looked to have the Guy's players floundering. Unfortunately\nthe try was not converted. The match\nat this point was looking fairly even,\nbut without any change to the score,\nuntil with a few minute remaining,\nthe stronger looking Guys' backs\nscored a try and converted it, shortly\nfollowed by a penalty kick. Halftime score to 22-11 to Guy's. The second half brought a tighter\ndefence to both sides and for the\nmost part the Marys' side spent a lot\nof time in the Guys' half, without\nbeing able to show anything for it,\ndespite some good runs by Rogers\nand Elliot. After twenty-five minutes\nwith no score change Guy's scored\n(again with two penalty kicks in a couple of minutes).\nAnother Rogers run led to a flourish of ruc ks which were Mary's dominated and so moving them from\ntheir own half deep into the Guy's defence, but to no avail. The Mary's players tried to keep their hopes up\nbut with five minutes remaining they\nbattled on. With a failed penalty kick\nfrom Guy's, Mary's touched down\nthe ball, which led to a scrum, where\nthere was a Guy's try, but there was\nno conversion. Full-time, and the\nblood-bound Guy's team had won.\nIn all the match had a great buzz\nabout it, and in particular it seemed\nthat great attention had gone by\nMary's into practising their line-outs,\nas Tremelling won a vast majority of\nline-outs for them. Mary's may not\nhave won it this time, but will be\nback next year in the final as they\nhave won the event twenty-nine\ntimes in it's122 year history.\nStMRFC 11 - 33 Guy's Hospital\nSedentary sport spectacular\nA tense Saturday afternoon of card\nplay crowned the resurgence of IC\nBridge Club. ICBC has come second\nfor the past 2 years in the annual\nLondon intercollegiate teams com-petition, The Chelsea Cup, making\nvictory this year especially sweet.\nCongratulations to the first team of\nDom 'the Bat' Goodwin, Joynur\n'Planet' Rahman, Brian Wong and\nMark 'Zebby' Schaffer, who beat\nLSE 1. by 21 VPs over 12 rounds.\nThis success is a sign of the\nstrength of the whole club, not just\nour top players. IC's bridge club is\nnow more active than any other col-leg e's, fielding 5 of the 13 teams\ncompeting in this event. For the\nuninitiated of you, bridge is nothing\nto do with old ladies' tea parties and\neverything to do with skill, judge-ment, beer and merriment (not necessarily in that order). Anyone interested in this socially vibrant club -come along to the Clubs Committee\nRoom on the top floor of the union\nbuilding 6pm any Tuesday night, or\ncontact g. cope@ic.ac.uk for details.\nBeginners are always made we l come.\nFinally, a special mention for the\n5th team, who w hopped the 4th s in\nevery way (except in the beer stakes\nafter the match...).\nA sports editorial\nThis week's sports pages see a welcome contribution from the chess\nand bridge clubs. Perhaps this will\nencourage more of the \"alternative\"\nsports clubs to write material as well.\nThis weekend sees the swordsmen\ngoing for national BUSA glory, and\nthe football firsts and fourths furthering their respective title challenges.\nSee you next week, possibly.\nMiners gotta lotta bottle\nAfter five years of trying, the RS M rugby team brought \"The Bottle\"\nback to the union bar. The game was\na fiercely fought contest from the\nstart, Cambourne literally fighting\nfor the ball. The weight of the RS M pack always meant that Cambourne\nwould struggle in the scrum s, with\nfavour.\nRSM took full advantage which\nled to a try from Man of the Match\nStuart. Cambourne were quick to\ncome back with a forwards' try in the\ncorner. RS M replied from the kick-off, after the first maul, the ball came\nback to them. Jeff, the fly half, took\nRSM taking several strikes against\nthe head early on in the game.\nSpecial mention goes to our two\nprops Jamie and Murray for their\nefforts. Lineouts were another of\nRSM superiority, with Omar catching everything that came his way.\nAfter twenty minutes RS M opened the scoring with a try in the\ncorner from Matt. At half-time only\nthe one try separated the teams, but\nnow RSM had the wind in their\nthe ball and delivered a killer blow,\nwith a superb drop-goal from half\nway.\nWith victory assured and with\nhordes of cheering supporters wetting themselves, it only remained for\nthe RSM to hang on for five minutes.\n\"The Bottle\" was finally held aloft\nby the RS M captain Martyn, and\nnow it sits proudly behind the union\nbar.\nRSMRFC 18-5 Cambourne\nFootball fourths' title charge\nAfter going a goal down as early as\nthe second minute, ICFC fourths\ndominated the game. Although only\none-all at half-time we should have\nbeen leading and the reasons for this\nwere bad misses by Pete, Darren and\nMorgan. Darren came good in the\nsecond half, completing his hat-trick,\nand Adam put us four-one up. A penalty was controversially conceded late on in the game which keeper\nStu' almost saved. A good win for\nIC, nearly confirming promotion.\nICFC IV 4 - 2 LSE V RESULTS\nMEN'S FOOTBALL\nIC I52 QM WIIC I62 King'sI IC II 1- 3 RV C IC IV50 School of Pharmacy\nIC IV 0 - 2 LSE V IC III 1-5 Royal Holloway IV WOMEN'S HOCKEY RS M03 Charing Cross\nMEN'S RUGBY St Mary's1133 Guy's Hospital\n\n"

This year\nprovided no exception with events\nthat lasted a total of over seven hours\nenjoyed by all that attended.\nThe evening started with punters\nsampling food from all the participating societies in the dining hall. This\nlasted longer than expected and the\ncultural show in the Great Hall was\ndelayed by some three quarters of an\nhour in the end. The show was well\nworth the wait, however.\nEach society performed a short\nand highly entertaining piece to\ndemonstrate their culture both traditional and modern. Of particular note\nwere the Malaysian society who did\n' iw1 \u2022\n\u2022\n1\n1 '\nfr*&':\nt\\i It\na traditional song known as 'Dikir\nBarat' which involved a twenty-five\nstrong chorus performing synchro-n is ed hand and body movements\nwhilst singing.

No International Night\nwould have been complete without\nthe Lebanese belly dancer and there\nwas another this year in full force\nproviding much entertainment for the\nmale populace present.\nThe audience seemingly enjoyed\nthe entire show and their support was\nalways evident not only in their\nappreciation for each act but their\nwillingness to join in with an\nimpromptu 'Macarena' lesson given\nby the Tamil Society. The two com-peres, Gaurav Misra and Zahira\nZainudin, handled the proceedings\nvery capably and provided an amusing touch to the evening with their\nmock bickering at the end of each\nitem.\nThe show went on well past mid-night, demonstrating that there had\nbeen a great amount of work put into\nit. The finale unleashed thousands of\npieces of silver paper onto the audience as well as many balloons,\naccompanied by the arrival onto\nstage of the national flags of all the\nparticipating countries.\nThe party then carried on in the\nSCR well into the small hours of\nSaturday morning.
