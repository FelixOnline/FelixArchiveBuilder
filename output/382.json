A quick once round the\nturntable however soon shows such an\nimage to be nowhere near the truth for\nthis album is a musical fusion indeed.\nThe tracks are not a formal rehash of\nHendrix's music; rather, they are new expressions which succeed in establishing\nnew identities whilst generally retaining\nthe savoury electronic rau nch and aggressiveness which still m esme rises so\nmany.\nUndoubtedly the best cut is the legendary \"Voodoo Chile\". The synthesis er lead is a touch of genius. This\nalbum is a new aspect of Hendrix which\nreally needs to be heard to be believed.\nHie\nEarth Juice: Return to Forever (Polydor\n2001-543)\nTaste blasted out at speed. Chick Corea has got a driving drummer behind\nhim on this, and Stanely Clarke, as us-,\nu al, doesn't put a toenail wrong on bass.\nThe pace is fast and the melody is push j ed by guitar and organ in unison. It's the\nsort of single that might make a listener\ntry and get hold of the album - in this\ncase \"Where have I known you before\".\nThe B side is just as impressive - prog ess ive70's jazz played by musicians\nwith ability and feeling. As a single it\nhasn't got a chance,-but that's to the\nmusic' s credit.\nfor them again. No expense has been\nspared and if you liked the Hollies in\nthe past this album wont disappoint you -for anyone looking for sounds of Interest\nthere are numerous more suitable new\nreleases.\nThey do what they can, and play well, but the songs have little to offer with the\nexception of \"another night\" and \"4th July, Asbury Park\", - meagre pickings on which to build an album.\nLove: Reel-tc-Real (RSO 2394-145)\nA new album from the reformed ' Love', and it's quite impressive. The music is\nsoulful, based around the writing and\nmannerisms of Arthur Lee. He calls all the shots and has produced an interesting\nLP with a lot going for it. The sound is\nfull and complete. There's nothing mis sing and the band are obviously a tight,\nwell-rehearsed unit, never sloppy. The\nbrass arrangements stand out especially\nwhen saxes are used to punctuate or lift\nparticular parts of a number.\nAll the numbers have been written or\nco-written by Arthur Lee, except for the\ntastefully-selected William De Vaughan\nsingle \"Be thankful tor what you got\",\nfaithfully reproduced presumably ' cos it\nwas always a nice tune. There's also a tremendously hot track called \"who are\nyou\" worthy of the best disco if this\none doesn't get them moving it's a case\nof mass rigor mortis.\nLyn Collins: Rock it le Again\n(Polydor 2066-490)\nThe vocals on this single comprise of\ncrass lyrics belted out not unlike Tina Turner. They are re petit at ive in the-ex-treme and seem to go on ad infinitum.\nHowever, this is all superfluous. These\nsounds come from the empire of Mr JB and as such, from the first note is endowed with the indefinable but unmistakable\nstamp-of effortless funk that almost all his music exudes making would-be successors unworthy of comparison.\nexpertise (a thing that was never in\ndoubt anyway). The dynamic duo go through the mechanics of standards like\nPorter's \"Love for Sale\" and Gershuin's \"Lady be Good\", as well as sprinkling\nthe album with some instant originals.\nOut of the two, Pass' s style is possibly\nthe more satisfying to listen to, leaning\nmuch to the be-bop influence of Charlie\nParker, while Ellis is slanted toward the\nmore conventional Charlie Christian and\nLester Young.\nAnyone who thinks technique is the\nbe alI and end all of guitar playing might\nenjoy this. Eee^s Ian Morse John Andrews Ken Welsh: Hitch-Hikers Guide to\nEurope (Pan)\nALTHOUGH my hitch-hiking experience is limited to one lift from Blackpool to Cleveleys, during which the young\nlady w hp picked us up talked about nothing but whips, I 've often considered giving it a serious try, especially after del ving into this book.\nAll the information you can possibly\nneed about hitching in over twenty countries (including the British Isles) is cram\ncrammed into its 300 pages; cheap places\nto eat, things to see, free sleeping areas\n(e.g. parks) etc. It's obviously been written from extensive personal experience,\nand is revised annually to bring it up to\ndate. The opening chapters are concerned\nwith the actual process of getting somewhere by this means of transport, but\nafter that the book is of equal use to anyone going abroad without an infinite\namount of money .Although I haven't had\nthe chance to use it yet I can see that\nits going to be invaluable; if the idea of\nsaving money appeals to you then you' ll find it a good investment, and even if all your possessions are on a pack on your\nback you should be able to find a place\nto stash this little book.\nThe Hollies: Another Night (Polydor\n2442-128)\nThis sounds like the standard sort of\nalbum that the hollies have been putting\nout for the last twelve years and could\ngo on doing so till grave-time. They are\nfairly predictable - losing popularity ana\nfavour, ending in lead singer Allan Clarke leaving in 1972 to pursue a solo\ncareer. Both singer and-group have a go\nat it without getting anywhere and then\nre-form to try their luck once again with\nthe public. You can't do that, if you are\ngoing to produce exactly the stuff that\ncaused the trouble In the first place not with much chance of success.

    "content": "FELIX\nSO THE frolicking, the click e mon-ge ring, the bump ho poste ring and the\nwriting on the wall is not quite over\nyet. There are to be further elections\nfor the non-sabbatical post of ICU Deputy President sometime next term\nsimply because the threshold of voters\nrequired for the election to be valid\nwas not reached. The question must be\nasked why was the threshold not\nreached?\nSome blame the candidates: \"They\nclearly did not put enough work into\ntheir campaigns\". Granted that the old\nbut highly lucrative (in terms of votes)\ntrick of person -tw-person canvassing\nwhich has been so successful in past\nyears was absent this year on the\nwhole, 1 understand that a lot of effort\nwas put into distributing posters and\nbump h sheets as widely as possible( even as widely as South Ken. tube\nstation).\nOthers blame the peculiarity of this\nyear's election system: \"Since i he O.P. candidates were known days before the\nmain election, why couldn't the Deputy\nPresident have been elected along with\nthe Hon. Sec. and Editor of FELIX?\"\nThe simple answer is that const iut ion ally it is not allowed: had the D.P. candidates put their names up at the same\ntime as the other candidates, all would\nhave been well. The peculiarity arose\nwhen an extension of time for nominations was required because no candidate for the post was fully seconded.\nThus it can be construed that it was the\ncandidates' fault for not getting their\nnames up in time.\nSome take a different attitude alto-get her: \"By failing to draw out the requisite number of voters, the candidates\ncan interpret the result as a vote of no\nconfidence in themselves\",\nThis may be so, but I have my\ndoubts. Whatever might be the rights or\nwrong's of this affair, the fact remains\nthat at the main elections, it took four\ncandidates and two very hard fought\ncampaigns for two sabbatical posts to\njust scrape over the voting threshold.\nTo ask just two candidates to recreate\nsuch enthusiasm with a similar doubled-up performance must surely highlight\nthe fact that our constitution does not\nreally cater for all the conceivable\nsituations that might arise at election\ntime.\n*\nCongratulations to Council on finishing so early last Monday at 8.40pm.

For let it never\nbe forgotten that nobody ever\non sul ted the British Public before allowing Britain to become a multi-racial state.\nToday the NUS is demanding that overseas fees be reduced to that for the home\nstudent, even though this\nwould lead to even fewer university places for ordinary\nBritish folk. Furthermore,\nthere is a myth that immigrants\navoid participating in political activities; the leader of the\nInternational Socialists is an\nIsraeli passport-holder, and\nsimilar iy the International\nMarxist Group is led by an Oxford-educated Pakistani, Tariq\nAli. Both organisations are beh in d vicious assaults on individual students in colleges throughout Brain, and both\nsupport the murderous IRA. Of course, anybody who has\nthe courage to speak up against these dangers is immediate-.y branded as a fascist by\nthese people.\nYours faithfully,\nF. Edwards\nIn reply to John Mortimer\nCity & Guilds Union,\n7th March 1975.\nDear Sir,\nMay I take space in your\nnewspaper to extend my deepest sympathy to Mr John Mortimer. It pains me greatly to\nsee a once sane man reduced\nto the inane ramblings of his\narticle in the l st issue of\nFELIX( No. 381).\nHis pretensions to grandeur and delusions of the stature of RSMU are to be expect-ed, but the multitude of factual inaccuracies could only\nhave been concocted by a man\nnot in the full possession of\nall his faculties. This may\nhave something to do with the\nlong separation of John from\nhis mascot, which obviously\nadds weight to the theory that\nthe Mines' Braincell is in fact\nkept in si de Davy. The extent of Mines' brain-power was fully illustrated by\ntheir purchase, for \u00a350, of a wooden replica of Davy, which\nwas in fact built and painted\nin under four hours. On the\nsubject of money, Mines\nshould be grateful to Guilds for giving them the motivation\nfor their record \u00a37 20 rag collection, on which we congratulate them.\nIn conclusion let me reiterate my sympathy for the R SMU President, and also his Union, whom he so rightly feels are\nin need of such egotistical\npio pog and a as constituted the\naforementioned article.\nYours sincerely,\nD.L. Barnes. VP C& GU\nMale Chauvinism?\nPhysics Dept.\nImperial College,\nDear Sir,\nWe had almost become i mr a. une to the interminable whining\nof pampered, grasping women.\nThe occasional mur me rings of\nthe post were tolerable but the\npresent fern, lib .campaign is utterly nauseous.\nWomen should stop moaning\nabout their lot. They are not\nunderprivileged. Recent campaign handbills distributed by\nthe Bra-Burner Soc .(or whatever they like to call them sel ves) tell us that IC has only\nc.a.10% women .The fact is that women should never be\nallowed into any university\nsince it diverts them from their\ntrue function as wives and\nmothers looking after the home.\nIt is a scientific fact that\nthe brain and nervous system\nof women is, in general, less highly developed than that of\nmen. This is shown over and\nover again We only need to\nlook at the great achievements\nof history to realise that men\nprovide the drive and brains\nfor advancement. Women are\nonly capable of playing a supporting role, acting as instruments of pleasure and providing entertainment for the bread-winner.\nProof of the inferior intellectual capacity and illogical thought processes of women is available here at IC. Consider the issue of the Union Bar.On the one hand they demand adm is sion to what ought to be a men-only bar and on the other\nthey refuse men admission to\nthe ICWA lounge except at certain times (wondrous c once s sion!) It really is about time\nwomen were returned to their\ncorrect place in the social\nstructure, and while we are\nabout it lets' restore the Union\nBar to i ts rightful status of a men-only bar.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Seal\nDave Scott\nStuart North\nSyd Wilkinson\nPosters\nChemistry Dept.\nImperial College.\nDear Sir,\nI notice that a large number\nof pro-eu io pe an posters have\nbeen removed from all over\ncollege.

    "content": "FELIX IT\nCROSS COUNTRY\nLast Wednesday saw the\nfifth and final league race\nheld on our home c ource,5'4 miles round Richmond Park. At the top of DivI was\nBarts and only 13 pts behind\nICI, so'fingers out' was the\norder of the day. The response\nwas varied. The course was\nvery fast, the first 22 runners\nbreaking 30 mins. and including such famous and notorious\nathletes as Rob All in son in\n8th place(28.37 mins), Speed\nSteve Webb in12 th(29.17) and\nnot only but also Paul Clarke\n22nd(29.59). Just outside the\n30 min -Payne barrier were\nAlf Garnet and the much battered and maligned (by\nBeans?) captain Jan HIli s. Dave Jones was spaced out at\n30th leaving a Yo-Ho-Ho and a pint of Youngs Jim Lad-Webster to lead the 2nd team home.\nTony Weir followed in 39th position and the Tractor\ncoughed and spluttered in at\n44th just behind the special\nguest artist PA. Baxter. Rich Harrington, as space r for the\n2nd team, tackled this task\nwith great verve and no a plo mb, providing a space of 21\nplaces coming in at 65th. The\n3rd team then gushed in led\nby Neil Boa g and Dave Payne.\nIt was finally flushed out by\nJohn Shearer, Andy Davey and\nAndy Fair head. All th se^ ood runs, including many personal bests were\nweD compensated for by some\nequally good personal worsts\nrecorded by the All Star Cast. Fourth team lead home by Wilf\nWelford in85 th. Pete Johnson,\nwho had to get up early that\nmorning, was a very creditable\n87th. Our 'three man lift' ex-pert, Bob Ignacink was 90th hot t ly pursued by Pad Donnelly. Dave Hunter was conned into running for us again\nand nearly beat Pad who tried\nto make all manner of excuses. IC first team won the match\nby 7 points from Barts thus\njust failing to win the league.\nIn DivII, IC II were first, IC\nIII 2nd and 1 CIV,11 th. This means that there are now 3 IC teams in Div I making up !4 of\nthe total! In the individual\nchampionship, R. All in son was\n2nd. Steve Webb 6th and Ian\nEllis8 th in Div I and Neil Boa g2 nd Rich Harrington 4th Mike Welford 6th and Hurrican\nHoulbrookle 8th in Div II. The\nLeague AGM, medal presentation and piss up will be at IC\non March 17 th .\nThe weekend was the\nclub's busiest so far, with\nraces on both Saturday and\nSunday . 3 college teams competed in Nottingham University' s5x3 mile road relay, on\na course round the campus\nconsisting of a long boring\nstretch of dual cain age nay and\ntwo near-vertical hills, one in each direction. The first stage\nsaw a minor s electoral mishap\nwhen Dave Jones, representing\nthe second team, decisively beat Alf Garnett, representing\nthe first team. This situation\nwas however rectified later in\nthe race. A notable appearance\nwas made for the third team by\nV. Mooney, in his first race\nsince last year's Newlands\nPark Relay, and running considerably faster than the remainder of t fie team. Our finishing positions are unknown,\nas the promoters failed to publish the results before closing time: however it was noticed\nthat the start / finish was very\nsparsely populated when the\nthird team finished.\nThe evening was spent\nsampling some local varieties\nof real ale, the more dedicated\nmembers finishing by joining an old-folk's sing-song in a Young's house in 'Ackney (the\nspotty centre of the metro-polis). Amazingly, It people mana ged to get up on Sunday morning in time for another race,\nstarting at 1 lam. This was the\nLondon Fire Brigade 4 x3 mile relay, each stage being\n2 laps of a circuit of Lambeth\nand Vauxhall bridges and the\nembankments between .The\norganisers had limited the entries from each establishment\nto 2 teams, and as a result the\nlist of entries was graced by 2\nteams from the Royal College of Music. After half of the first\nstage a feeling od deja vue\nwas present as Dave Jones( IC 2) had a20 year lead over\nIan Ellis( IC 1); however the\norder had been reversed at the\nend of the stage. Both teams\nperformed excellently, the first\nteam (Ian Ellis,15:13; Steve\nWebb, 15:03; Paul Clark, 15:\n16; Rob All in son,14:19) finishing 11 th in59'51, close behind teams from some of the\nbest clubs in the South-East.\nThe second team (Dave Jones,\n15:21; Alf Garnett, 15:45; Neil Boag, 1 5:58; Dave Houlbrooke\n(everybody's favourite mis print), 15:52) were 20th in 62:\n56. A measure of the clubs\nimprovement this year is that\nSOC CfR Last Saturday's2 nd XI opponents were something of an unknown quantity, as we had never played them before, and after\nour scintillating display, I doubt they will be in any hurry to play\nus again. The whole team played as if they had been born with\ntheir hockey sticks in their hand, just waiting for this match.\nThe first half started off\nquietly as we tested the opponent's defense, but, as we\nrealised their full backs were\na bit slow, shots began to\nshower in on the goalkeeper.\nDespite all this pressure,\nthough, we only managed to\nnet one goal, from Andy Brewster, a particularly vicious shot from a yard out!\nAt half-time, it was generally thought we should have\nhad several more, with such\nattacking play down both\nwings, and determined support\nfrom all the half-backs, Pete Nowell, in particular, who had\na splendid game, and even\nmanaged to ref. at the same\ntime .\npreviously no-one had broken\n15:30 for this course, and our\nteams have recorded times of\nc65 minutes in the last two\nyears.\nThe motley collection of\nmusicians finished 31stand40 th respectfully, including a particularly good run by the\nremains of Ian Isherwood.\nNone of the times however\na ump are very favourably with\nthe 13:17 recorded by one A. Simmons of Luton, who knocked an enormous chunk off the\nstage record.\nFinally, it had been hoped\nto publish in this weeks report,\na list of err aQ for last weeks,\nreport, but it has been disco v ered that this would be rather\ntoo long to fit in FELIX, and\nwould probably be misprinted\nanyway. However ti should be\nnoted that the team holding the\naway match on Feb19 th was\nBRUNEL, not BRUNCH. The London Inter - Collegiate Table Tennis league h;i^ started this term, (a little late maybe, but it has started), and both\nour teams are doing extremely well. The 1 st team is top of div .\nI. and unbeaten even though\nit's composition is a little unpredictable due to the vast\nnumber of good players we\nhave .Starting with a walk-over\nagainst Q MC;G. King, A. Beal and C. Too then had an easy\n1 0 - 0 against the Institute of\nEducation. This was followed with an\nespecially good win by Y Cheuk, C. Too and S. Gunasingham, each of whom had until\nrecently little or no match ex-peri en ce. Nevertheless, our\nteam went to Chelsea college and beat their second team\n9 - 1 .\nThe following week G King, C. Too and S. Gunasingham,\nbeat a strong Bedford 1 st team\n7 - 3 ; their closest match so\nfar. The crunch should come\nin the next fortnight when they,\n(hopefully), meet Chelsea I and then University College.\nThe second team, Steve\nDes brus la is, Brian Clark and\nGraham Healy, had similarly\nhad no match experience until\nrecently. Despite losing their\nfirst match 10 - 0 to the Royal\nDental Hospital, they have\nnever looked back, and recently thrashed Institute of Edu cation II 7 - 3, and Bedford II\n9 - 1 . This, coupled with a walk over against QM C places them close behind RD H on set\naverage.\nDue to the arrangement of\nthis league, (by me, under pre-s sure), the playing of matches\nis very much in the air, and\nsome colleges are collecting a massive backlog. Even so\nImperial College appears to be\nshowing it' sun doubt able,( by\nme anyhow), strength at this\nsport.\nThe second half brought\nsome respectability to the\nscore, Andy Brewster scored\nas a result of a short corner\nin the first minute, and this\nwas quickly followed by Gins Parker netting, despite vehement appeals for offside (which\nhe wasn't). In one of their few\nraids into our half, Rothampstead managed to snatch a goal\nback, but this was quickly overshadowed by two further\ngoals for us, one by Andy\nBrewster (again!), making his\nhai rick( which he no doubt regretted in the bar afterwards).\nChas Hardy added another one,\nbut, with the last hit of the\nmatch Rothampstead pulled another ore back, so the final\nscore was 6 - 2 .\nTeam: N. Harrison: J. Huckle:\nP. Nair; A. Turner; P Mowell;\nJ. Brownridge; D. Balderson;\nI. Read; C. Parker; A. Brewster;\nC. Hardy.\nRIFLE\nCLUB\nThe past few weeks have\nseen the annual shoot-out between Guilds, RCS and, much\nto everyones (at least in the\nRifle Club( sup rise,RS M for\nthe small-bore (.22 calibre)\nprone rifle trophy, \"The Courtman Shield\" . The competition\nwas won for the third year running by Guilds, of course,\nafter a closer competition than\nhas been the case for some\nyears. Both Guilds and RCS were fielding strong teams;\nMines were represented by\nsome very dubious talents,\nthus following a tradition that\ngoes back almost unbroken for\nmany years.\nThe trophy goes to the first\ncollege to win two rounds, and\nthis year went to Guilds on\nwinning two rounds to RCS' s. Round One was a narrow victory to RCS, after holding, and\nloosing most of, a considerable\nlead at first. Round Two went\nto Guilds by an equally narrow\nmargin, but the Guilds team\nshot a very commendable average of 96 out of a possible\n100. The teams thus went into\nRound Three level. Both sides were unable to maintain the\nform of previous rounds but\nRCS dropped most after some\ns uprising results giving the\nround and the competition to\nGuilds, as was to be expected.\nNobody paid any attention to\nwhat Mines were doing.\nCongratulations to the team\nof:-G.

In my opinion\nthis letter illustrates well a phenomenon not uncommon at\nIC namely female sexual f rust ration.\nMost women come to IC with\ntwo thoughts in mind, firstly\nthat IC is a good college academically and secondly that\nbecause of the sex ratio at IC their sex lives will be a bund ant, what they do not seem to\nrealise is even if a boy is desperate he will not go out with\na girl he does not fancy. Mi ss\nList z has been here at 1C for\nV/i years and this is obviously\nan advanced case and she has\neven degenerated to the extent\nthat she regards a pinball\nmachine as a phallic symbol,\nI have never heard of anywhere\nwhere a man can satisfy himself for lOp as Miss Les tz suggests.\nIn my opinion Miss List z letter typifies the opinions of women at IC and I think that\ntheir sexual frustration is self\ninflicted and if women would\nstop staying in writing such\ndr iv le and get out and enjoy\nthemselves their lives would\nbe much better.\nThis letter will obviously\ncause controversy and I expect it might cause a flood of \"catty\" replies but I think\nthat these things have to be said.\nYours faithfully,\nM.A. Hobson.\nFRce PUBticiryi\nFor Your Club Events,\nMeetings, Etc.\n\u00ab AC CAMPOS RADIO \u00bb\nHAS ABOUT 2 , 0 0 0 LISTENERS EVERY TUESDAY IN COLLEGE BLOCK\nHEAR YOUR NEWS ON THE AIR\nCONTACT : STEVE DONOHOE EE II\nW \u00a3 N \u00a3W MEDIA\nSoon in Southside and the Union\ncg.e.

    "content": "FELIX SPORT'. C.1ST XV v. St. Edmunds Hall, Oxford.\nDuring miserable weather some fine handling and rugby skills were exhibited by both sides in this close game between two\nclosely matched teams. St. Edmunds started the match with 14\nmen but IC found it difficult to capital is e on this initial adv ant age. In fact St Edmunds took the lead after 20 minutes from a penalty just outside the\ntwenty-five. Five minutes\nlater an Oxford back was forced to leave the field, temporarily injured, and during his absence IC gained the lead.\nTo their sup rise the forwards\nwon quick second-phase ball near the Oxford line and an initial break by outside-half Ray\nHughes resulted in a fine try\nby M. Cotter, B Finney convert-ed. At half-time an extremely\ncourageous event occurred\nwhen three spectators emerged\nfrom Harlington bar to brave\nthe weather and watch the\nwhole of the second half on\nthe touch line. Ten minutes in to this half St Edmund's fifteenth player arrived (and in fact was their captain) which\nconsiderably strengthened\ntheir side. However IC stuck\nto their job and despite the\nloss of Jj Gilbert, who had to\nretire with a badly bruised\nshin, good tackling and determination from IC held the\nscore in their favour ti 1\n1 the\nfinal whistle. COMMENTS:\nA well deserved victory\nwhich completes a double over\nSt Edmunds after beating them\naway 1 8 - 1 2 last year. The\nExtras\nThe last match of the season for the extras was against\nEaling RFC. Both sides had\n15 men and a good game was\nhad.\nFor the first 10 mins the\nextras defended their try line\nwhile the opposition pressurized us continually .Winning\nmost of the set ball the extras\nfought back and then the break\ncame. Ealing' s Full back ho is ted a high ball which M. Spencer (playing full back for the\nfirst lime in5 years) caught,\nkicked and then chased it. The\nEaling FullBack, didn't have\nthe same success with it and\nM. Spencer kicked the ball\nalong the deck over the line\nand dived on it for an excellent try. The Ealing players\ncame back hard and though\nthey had the advantage of the\nref . losing his pen where\nheld back . Half time 4 - 0 \u2022 \u2022\nIn the Second half the extras returned the pressure and\nwere finally awarded a penalty which M. Spencer kicked(70). S. Chudy decided to go\nfor tea and biscuits and M. Spencer dropped a goal from\n30 yards.\nThe game continued in\nmuch the same manner back-referee was fair but slightly\nhampered by his need to continually tuck his pension book\ninto his shorts thus keeping\nhim about 20 yards (sorry 18.76\nmetres) behind play. However\nhis age did not affect his tongue in the bar and to B. Austin s discomfort related the age,\nheight, and sex of every English Internation from 1948 on-wards.\nAt half-time Arthur was\nseen 'a ying down pesticide on\nthe pitch but was told that the\nslugs were in fact the IC front\nfive. A good-time was had by\nall on the resulting pub crawl\nback to the Union bar.B. A us tin deciding that he had not\nsuffered enough at the refer-ee's mouth, walked out of the\nQueens and was cashed over\nthe head with an umbrella\nwhich was wielded in the hand\nof a depraved Scotsman. Later he thought it might have been\nsomething he said. Team : Head Case, Not Slow,\nLots of Smiles, Rupert, His\nWall, Hedge, Heather, SLVGgish. Peanuts (see above) Watergate, Four on the trot. Paperless, Last minute. Corrupted,\nHuge asset.\nwards and forwards and the\nfinal whistle went with the\nscore 10 - 0 for IC. Team: MSpencer (Why didn't you convert the try) M. Ranson\n'! was bloody unlucky\"'\nM Gibson \"Hope I play better\nfor Ireland Next week '\nS. Ladle \"Typical of the capt.\nto go off for a wank\"\nCWhiteley (I can't stay out\nlate drinking)\nJ. Hughes (The man with gut\nache)\nR. Trecise \"Didn'tI play well\"\nR. Doyle \"UVh WOT\"\nS. Hayle \"There hooker had\nbad breath\" R. Beddoes \"I feel like a puke\"\n(You look like one)\nP. Jeffs \"Refefuckingsee\"\nR. Sutton \"Should have played\nNo\u00a3\"\nJ Smith \"I would have scored\nbut I thought I'd give Paul his\nIst touch of the ball\" (2nd half)\nP. Tulley (Got his hair ruffled)\nS. Chindy \"What' 11 you do without me next Season\"\nThe Ref - \"I'm that as well -I 'll 'are you Sutton\"\nThi s was a good end to a good season in which the extra\nlost only 3 games and I think\ndrew one. Players played in\nFremlin Pot\nIC 'Open' Singles Darts Knockout Competition\nPaul Whitlock, the winner (left) being presented with the pot.\nMONDAY night saw the finals of this prized competition.\nEight years ago the Fremlin Brewery, later taken over by Whitbread, presented the pot; now known as \"The Fremlin\", to Imperial College. Last Monday saw the climax of this years competition which being the Fjnal night consisted of the quarter-finals, semi-finals and the\nfinal . The quarter finals were\nplayed with twice winner Bob Barley losing dramatically to\nnewcomer Dave Crook . This was followed by Mike (I want\nto be Darts Club President\nnext year) Gibson losing to\nBarry Shurety in a manner reminiscent of all great club Presidents .Next came the\nmatch between Paul Whitlock\nand Pat Shurety; after a bit of\na hassle and cries of \" referee\" Pauls fot led home the\nwinning double . The last\nquarter-final match was to\nhave been between Male\n(Supercaptain, \"we've only\nlost one match this season\")\nRan son and Derek (Superfuzz)\nForbes .However Superfuzz\nfailed to turn up with an obvious attack of nerves\n(apathy?) or was it fear and so\nSupercap humbly went through\nto the semi-finals. The semifinals started with a hard\nfought clash between Dave\nvarious positions usually designated on the way to the\nground. People were dragged\nfrom their beds and volunteered into playing . Players developed over the season and\nI think IC rugby, though small\non Saturdays will have no problem in admitting how good it\nis. Thanks to all those who\nplayed for us this season, well\ndone and good luck to those\nwho like me are leaving this\nyear. I hope you carry on playing wherever you go .\nCrook and Barry Shurety the\noutcome being that experience\ncounts, so Barry won. However\nthe second semi-final was brilliant. This of course was\nbetween Paula( Hiya Fellas)\nWhitlock and Mai( Supercap)\nRan son. It was a hard fought\ngame with Paula easily p is sing (oops sorry Ed) on his\" friend\" the captain in the\nfirst game. The following game\nsaw Paula completely bewildered as Supercap streaked\nthrough the game in 16 darts.\nThe last game was really the\nantic Umax of what seemed like\na certain win for Supercap .1\nneed say no more than Paul won.\nFinally, the final was played (excuse the pun ) This was\na hard game with Paul obviously showing his confidence of\nplay beating Barry(Where were\nthe doubles) Shurety with ease .\nObviously his confidence came\nfrom beating Supercap. Seriously though, many congratulations must be given to Paul Whitlock for winning the Freml in Pot in only his first year\nat IC. Thanks must also be given\nto Brendan Clements for all hi s help and advice in running\nthis competition to its successful conclusion. All I can say now is any\ntakers for next years competition and where was the support\nfrom the Darts Club members\nthis year!?\nMale Ranson\n(President, Darts Club.)\n\n"

Council agreed to submit to\nthe next U GM the proposal: \"That the next Council should be\nheld in Weeks Hall, subject to developments\". The Editor of\nFELIX' s comment that Council would risk losing its conservative image(!) was met with applause. Refectories: Refectory prices seem bound to go up. The\nCollege wished this to happen in time to catch the summer con ference trade. A suggestion of a two-tier price system was\nmade, facilitated by the production or non-production of a registration card.\nGoverning Body/Council Dinner: Council agreed that the recommendation should be referred back. Query: The Editor of FELIX queried the statement in the\nPresident's open letter to all members of ICU which stated that\nhe did not \" anticipate any extensive ... clash of duties\", and\nyet the President was unable to attend Council. The Hon. Sec. replied that the President was attending UL U as S RC Chairman\nnot just as President-elect of UL U. Hon. See's Business\nElections: A letter was read from the President of R SMU, concerning an article by one of the candidates for a sabbatical\npost which had been published in the Mines Newsletter, reputing the allegation that bias had been shown by R SMU.

Imperial College: At a demo on 28th February, a banner had\nbeen displayed bearing the words IC Communist Party. This contravened Union Policy( Council, 18/11/74). The Hon. Sec. indicated that the people involved would be notified of this.

French Trip: Mr Branthwaite reported that a group of French\nstudents were visiting the College at the week-end of March\n15th/16 th, and he needed to find accommodation for them.

The Deputy Pre s ident undertook to speak to the Bar manager about the incident.\nFELIX: Mr Frimstone asked why FELIX had not been avail able the previous Friday morning . The Editor of FELIX explain ed, in some detail, that this was due to faults both in the machinery and the paper used. The meeting closed at 8.40pm. HON SEC\nJacqui Gerrard\nThree years ago John McCullough, the President of ICU, prepared a Policy Statement. This was a compilation of motions\npassed by UG M's. He recommended that such a Statement should\nbe reviewed every year and completely rewritten every three\nyears. In the past three years no-one has reviewed it, until now.\nI have almost finished completely rewriting the Statement,\nbringing it up to date by incorporating in it all our new pol-icy. It should be possible\neach year for a supplementary\ndocument to be published,\namending the present Statement.\nThe new document should\nbe ready just before Easter.\nIf you want some interesting\nreading, please collect one\nfrom the UnioB office. There\nwill be more available just\nafter the Easter vacation . At\nthe AGM in May you will be\nasked to accept the document\nas a true statement of our\npolicy. It will be too late at\nthe meeting to say that you\nhave not had a chance to\ncheck that it is a true statement . so read it before the\nmeeting. If you wish you can\ncheck it with the minutes of\nthe meetings.\nSome people have asked me\nwhy it is necessary to have\nsuch a document. One of its\nmain uses is to delegates at\nNational Conferences. They\nare supposed to vote according to our policy (ie your wish es); thus the document enables\nthem to see at a glance what\nthose wishes are. It should\nalso be of use to anyone presenting a motion to aUG M. It will tell him how the Union\nhas felt in the past on that\nty pic.// you do not like some of\nthe policy in the document,\npresent a motion to a UGM reversing or amending the policy.\nA while ago every student received a card from Ensleigh Insurance with a letter from Trevor Philips telling them that they were\ninsured against accident and death.\nMost people ignored this, hence they are not making claims.\nYou could claim up to \u00a310 per week for up to 104 weeks if you are injured. This covers you for\n24 hours a day during term time\nand during the vacations when you might be able to claim, see\non any Union or College act Trevor Phillips in the Union\niv it y.

    "content": "mix3 ram t foc for THE LAST ever Sunday Times National Student Drama Festival is to be held in London's West End next month ... and wi II\nfeature IC Dramsoc's Christmas production of \"Albert Bridge\".\nThe selection of Dramsoc's production from over 100 entries must surely rank as one\nof the most significant achievements of any IC society, social or sporting, for many years .\nLast night a spokesman told\nme: \"Naturally we are delight-ed. The Festival is acknowledged all over the world as\nrepresenting the cream of\nBritish student theatre, so (or\nus, a drama group in a college\nof science and technology,\nthe selection is doubly satis-tying. ''\nAlbert's Bridge\" was\nwritten by Tom Stoppard as a radio play, but adapted for the\nstage and directed at Imperial\nby Denys Bennett. Details\nhave yet to be finalised, but\ntie play will appear at the\nCollegiate Theatre (University\nCollege) on MONDAY April7 th for two performances, matinee\nand evening.\nBut what of the rest of the\nFestival? I spoke to Clive Wolfe, the Festival Director:\n\"This year's20 th Anniversary Festival runs from April\n6th to 12th, and will be the\nmost ambitious ever. Several\nWest End theatres are being in-corporate d, including the Royal\nCourt, the Young Vic and the\nTheatre Upstairs.\"\n\"In addition to the selected\nBritish student productions,\nthere will be invited groups\nfrom Li son and Turkey, and\nDavid Ponting will bring his\nacclaimed one-man Dylan\nTiomas show. There will also\nbe some practical workshops\nincluding movement sessions\ntaken by John Broome, former\nchoreographer with the Royal\nShakespeare Company.''\nSeason tickets for entry to\nall Festival events and shows\nare available now, and individual tickets from March 24th. Enquiries should be made to\nthe Festival offices at 20,\nLansdowne Road, N.10, telephone 8834586 .Watch out for\nposters and leaflets around\ncollege!\nBu beneath IC Dramsoc's successful exterior, life has\nnot been a bed of roses. In\nfact this year has been characterised by a shortage of\nenthusiastic stage and technical crew, which almost resulted in the cancellation of\nthe Drama Festival entry.

And what a contrast to these days when a nurse, however dedicated, silently\nwishes that you would expire\nwither before or after tea break . How much more dignified to die from a fall or of hypothermia rather than euthanasia. But we are no longer\nallowed to do so. Doctrines\ndemand that we herd together\nall those who cannot even feed\nthemselves, to be fed, washed\nand fed again, in hot-house\nsurroundings until some unfortunate doctor is called upon to\nmake the fateful decision.

    "content": "FELIX\n7\nFELIX' MOTOR RALLY THE FIRST ever FELIX Annual Motor Rally was held last\nSunday afternoon. Although it was a rather cold day all the\nteams duly arrived on time and had their vehicles checked by\nofficials of the City and Guilds Motor Club. Seven teams were\nentered for the event, three each from Guilds and Mines and one\nfrom RCS. Two of the competing vehicles were Clem\nand Bo' and though C lem arrived back ear ii er,Bo' was placed hi gher on points\ndespite the fact that it developed a petrol leak on the\nreturn journey . RCS were unable to enter J ez as one of\ntheir vehicles due to the fact\nthat she has been undergoing\nextensive repairs (which are\nstill in progress) since going\non the Brighton run. The treasure hunt was in two legs, the first starting\nfrom the Albert Hall and finishing at Tower Hill. Here\neach team had to purchase\nexample at Trafalgar Square,\n\" Generally, logs are not mil-it ary, naturally, but how long\ndid this one live?\" The answer clearly relates to one of\nthe statues in Trafalgar Square: General Napier, who\nlived 1782-1853, a total of\n7 1 years. Other clues were\nalmost blatant: and at Buck ingham Palace,\" How many\nbared female breasts are\nthere on the Victoria memorial?\" Answer: a suggestive\ntotal of twenty-two.\nThe result of the Rally was announced in the Union Bar at8.00 pm by the Editor\nwho then presented the pot\nThis year's winners at Trafalgar Square,\nan old age pensioner's and a child's ticket of admittance\nto the Tower. In addition\neach driver and co-driver had\nlo visit Trafalgar Square\nwhere they had their photographs taken by F EL JX photographer Roger Wilkins.\nOne famous land marie\nwhich the teams had to vi sit\nthe \" domed cathedral\"( St\nPaul's). This proved to be a trouble- some spot because\nseveral of the teams arrived\nwhile a service was in progress . Thi s did not deter the\nparticipants who quickly found a solution to this difficulty by making a quick\ndonation to the offertory box\nand then asking the verger to\nhelp solve the clue. It was per n pas unfortunate that the\nparticular verger that most\nteams encountered gave out\nthe wrong answer to one of\nthe more important questions. Whilst some clues were\ndead easy, ott e ers possessed\nunexpected subtlety: for\nto the winners. It was coincidental that it was a Guilds\nbar night on the same Sunday\nnight. Organisers and contestants a like then proceeded\nto celebrate in fine style,\nand it was generally accepted that the first Rally had been a successful one: The\nresults were:\nls t:C&G U( Paul Bentley,\nJenny Jones) with 70 points\nJoint 2ndR SMU( Dave Carlile, Kevin Dabinett) and\nC& GU( Peter Amey, Dru\nBrown) bothe with 67 points\n4th:R SMU( Richard le Sueur,\nJustin Snelling) with 62 pts\n5thC& GU( Charles Lamont,\nKeith Ahlers) with 56 pts\nJoint 6 th:.R CSU( Chris Pollard, Nick Roe) and R SMU( Steve Bottomley, Denis\nGosney) both with 39 points.\nMay we, at FELIX, express our thanks to all those\nwho took part; we look forward to organising a similar\n(but much improved) Rally next year.\nMONOPOLY\nTony Jones\nLast weekend saw one of the most ambitious Rag stunts for\nsome time. On Saturday morning, 13 teams of 3 or 4 people, each\narmed with a mascot, were released from the RCS Union Office\non to the biggest Monopoly board in the world - London town\nitself.\nThis event was the cul mi nation of much hard work by\nMartin Kessler, and Ian V in cent, since the idea was first\nmooted at an RCS Rag Committee meeting over a year ago.\nThe aim of the game was to\ncollect money for the Leukaemia Research Fund and have\na good time as well. Each team was provided with a list\nof Monopoly sites to be visit ed, and a question to be answered at each one. Teams scored five points for each correct\nanswer and ten points for each\npound collected.\nAlthough the weather started off fine, it soon began to\nrain, and wet, di she belled Monopolists were to be seen\ntramping up streets as far\nafield as Whitechapel and Old\nKent Road, begging for meagre\npittances en route.\nUnfortunately, the total\namount collected for Leukaemia came to only \u00a3165 ; no\ndoubt this was mainly due to\nthe bad weather.\nThe winners, travelling\nunder the name of their mascot \"Jerry\", collected a bottle\nof whisky for their efforts. The\nfastest team was \"Prawn-Blaster\" who returned after 4\nhours, but it was not until\n8.30pm that \"Drum\" crawled\nup the steps of the RCS Office\nafter a10 hour stint, soaked to\nthe skin(?l) For the record, the final\npositions of the teams to get her with their points were as\nfollows:\n1 Jerry, 770, 2 Top Hat,\n460, 3 Gas Mask, 435, 4 Armour,395r5 Abo,375, 6, Kettle,\n335, 7 Drum,315 8 Community\nChest,270, 9 Little Will,265,\n10(equal) Prawn-Blaster, and\nthe combined efforts of guilds\nand mines, 240, 11 Sunflower,\n190, and Interstellar Duck,155.\nFELIX\nCompetition\nPhotographic\nFirst Prize: \u00a35\n(Entry fees will be added to 1st,2 nd, and 3rd prizes.)\nRules:\n1.
