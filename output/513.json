    "content": "Page2 Dear Sir, -1 am writing in reply to\nthe letters, in last week's FELIX, by Raouf Zaidan, Tony Gox and\nJanKo ol.I will only attempt to\nanswer the argument' which\nappears to be common in all\nthree.\nTony Cox and JanKo oli both\nquestioned why I should believe\nthe Bible's ruling on homosexual-it y, when at the same time I probably didn't believe other\nparts oi' the Bible, such as\nCreation in seven days. This\nargument, though it appears to be\nvalid, fails, because I do believe\nthe world was created in six days\n(I believe all the Bible or none of\nit). I am not the only Christian, or\ncivil engineer, who believes this.\nU.S. President Jimmy Carter also\nbelieves in Creation in six days, so\ndoes Dr. Henry Morris, who for\nmany years was Head of the Civil Engineering Dept. at Virginia\nPolytechnic Institute. (Henry\nMorris is now Director of the\nCreation Research Center in San\nDiego, California. He once said\nthat \"to interpret the Bible literally is\nsimple to take God at his word.\")\nAbsolute standards, such as a' Bible', are also used in engineering. For example, in\nconcrete design all engineers must\nwork according to the Code of\nPractice, CP110(a set of rules and\nguidelines). The men who instituted CP110 are experts in\ntheir field, the engineers who\ndesign according to it often aren't. If an engineer designs a structure\nwhich fails; and if his design\ncontradicted CPU O, then he is\nliable. In effect CP110 is treated\nas absolute - even with authors\nwho are fallible and a code which\ncan be altered. (One lecturer\nactually refers to CP110 as,'the\nBible'). Similarly the Moral Laws\ncontained in Exodus and Leviticus are a 'Code of Practice'.\nThe bold statements and clear\nguidelines laid out in CP110 are\nto be obeyed - not interpreted:\nlikewise with the statements on\nMoral Laws in the Bible. Unlike\nCP110 the Bible does not change\nand its Author is not fallible.\nThe Bible's main purpose is in\nfact, not a 'Code of Practice', but\nrather God's communication, or\ntestament, to all mankind. God created man and the world\nperfect. The Creation only\nbecame imperfect as a result of\nman's sin, whereupon death\nentered into the world. Because\nGod loves everyone of us and does\nnot want anyone to go to Hell, he\nsent his only Son Jesus Christ to\ndie for our sins, so that whosoever\nbelieves in Him will have\neverlasting life (in Heaven). This\nis what Christianity is all about:\nthe message of the Bible from\nbeginning to end. The Laws, or\n'Codes of Practice', are only a part of it.\nI believe that homosexuality is\nwrong, principally, because of\nwhat The Bible says. In addition\nmy conscience and my observation of the design of the\nhuman body confirm this belief. II\none rejects the Bible and the\n'conscience' argument as not\nbeing reasonable, then I am left\nwith the design of the human\nbody; but this requires a belief in\nCreation, so that it too comes\nfrom the Bible. Thus in reply to\nTony Cox's challenge, for a reason why homosexuality is\nwrong without referring to the\nBible, I can only say that I have\nno other reason - only the\nBible.\nYours faithfully.\nJamie Shotter\nCiv Eng3. Dear Sir, - Although this\ncorrespondence has been continuing for some time and few\nnew points appear to have been\nraised on the subject of abortion, I felt I must reply to the letters\nraised by Sean Kelly and Barry\nAustin in FELIX last week.\nI respect the view p rolf erred by\nboth of them, although I do not\nagree with it, that life begins from\nthe moment of conception.\nHowever there is a point I must\nstress that this is simply a point of\nview and can be nothing more.\nThe British Medical Association\nhave been totally unable to define\nlife, and I really fail to see why\neither of them appear to be so\nmuch better informed about these\nmatters than this highly qualified\nand well-established institution.\nIf the ultimate aim of these\nanti-abortionists is to make\nabortion illegal then an opinion of\na section of the community is\nbeing imposed on all women\nwhether they agree with it or not.\nIf free abortion on demand were\navailable in this country, no-one\ncould force a woman to abort her\nchild, that decision would be left\nentirely to her opinion on the\nsubject and not Mr. Austin's and\nMr. Kelly's. Surely this is\nconsistent with the democratic\nsociety in which we live.\nEven if abortion were made\nillegal, there would be no way of\neliminating it completely, the\nalternative being intolerable to\ntoo many women. Those women\nwho could afford it would look\noutside Britain and those who\ncouldn't,ft he vast majority of\nBritish women), would be driven\nto back street abortions. Surely\nBarry Austin is not advocating a return to a high incidence of\nseptic abortions which would be a direct result of a change in British\nlaw as it stands.\nI was horrified to hear Sean\nKelly say that a woman who\nconceived a child alter rape\nshould not be allowed an\nabortion. Barry Austin totally\ndisregarded the issue by saying\n'conception from rape is extremely rare,\nand rape isn't too common either'. The\nfact that conception from rape is\nfairly uncommon would not help\nalleviate the mental anguish a woman in this situation would be\nforced to undergo by these two\ngentlemen. As rape at this college\nalone occurs at the rate of three to\nfour a year and nationwide\nstatistics . are increasing all the\ntime, the situation may not be so\nfar removed from their lives as\nthey seem to think.\nAs neither of them will ever\nundergo the experience of rape or\nunwanted pregnancy themselves,\nI merely presume neither of them\nhave given thought and consideration towards the woman\ninvolved in either of these\ndilemmas. Mr. Austin even\nappears to be saying no matter\nhow good a person's reasons are\nshe should not be allowed to\nterminate her pregnancy. Is he\nreally suggesting that no abortion\nshould take place even if\nconsidered medical opinion agrees that the child would be\nborn abnormal or that in giving\nbirth the mother may die? Or is\nthere no end to the atrocities the\nPATA would like to see carried\nout.\nI would like to suggest that\nBarry Austin should restrain\nhimself from ramming his\nopinions down other peoples\nthroats, and from attempting to\nlegally enforce his point of view on\nall women.\nStella Earnshaw\nChemistry I Eds note - correspondence on this topic\nis now closed.\nDear Sir, - I will not say that I was 'ashamed to be a member of\nthis Union' when the quorum of\nthe last Union General Meeting\nwas challenged by our President,\nbut I very much felt that\ndemocracy had been under-mined.\nI have the highest respect and\nregard for Mary's political and\nideological opinions, and for the\ndetermined and active way in\nwhich she pursues her belief's. Nevertheless, some points need to\nbe made as regards the conduct of\nU.G. M.'s with respect to a challenge to the quorum.\nThe purpose of a quorum at a meeting is to ensure that no\ndecision is made by a group of\npeople that is not reasonably\nrepresentative. Most Imperial\nCollege Union General Meetings\nare capable of producing a fairly\nrepresentative decision. No meeting can be totally representative but unless we have\na certain amount of 'licence' on\nthe qu or a e.y ol meetings Imperial\nCollege Union would never reach\nany sort of constructive decision.\nI think it was fairly clear that\nthe last U. GM. felt that College\nshould not be put in awkward\npositions over job interviews, as it\nwas in the incident concerning\nRoberts Construction. Having said this I disapprove, and I certainly believe the meeting\ndisapproved, of the situation in\nSouth Africa, but it is a fundamental principle of our\nsociety that an individual is\nperfectly entitled to come to his\nown decision on such matters.\nImperial College Careers Service is undoubtedly one of the\nbest in the country but if we\ncontinue to abuse it consequences\nto I.C. students, arising from the\nloss of respect for the service,\ncould be serious. The motion put\nto the U. G.M. said nothing about\nSouth Africa, it merely recognised\npersonal freedom of opinion and\nopposed the abuse of the Careers\nService.\nWhatever the pros and cons oi\nthe motion, lor a Union President\nto challenge the quo racy of a meeting that was fairly close to\nthe 300 mark, and consequently\nas near quo rate as we are likely to\nget, was wrong. It was\nparticularly wrong when at a previous U. G.M., the quorum\nhaving been successfully challenged, Mary referred to\ncertain Union members as\n'bastards', and when the motion\nbeing discussed was particularly\nsupported by those students\nwhom it would most directly\naffect. Namely students of the\nRoyal School of Mines.\nI am disappointed in Mary's attitude. We elected a President\nwho stood for 'democracy and\naction'. She certainly stands for\naction but does she stand for\ndemocracy?\nYours,\nTony Cox\nPhysics 2.\nDear John, - Unaccustomed as I am to public writing, I now feel\nthat the action taken by our\nbeloved? ICU President at the last\nICU GM demands a few words.\nFirstly, for those not present a few facts. After the hustings were\nover the agenda was changed to\nallow discussion of the motion on\n'job recruitment' - a motion\nwhich has great importance over\ncareer prospects lor final year\nstudents. It was unfortunate, in\nmy opinion, that discussion of the\nmotion as far as Miss Attenborough was concerned\ntook on a bitter flavour in the\nform of a double barreled attack\non South Africa and not the\nmotion on the floor.\nThis far from radical motion,\nbasically protecting rights of\nindividual students to freedom of\nchoice about future employment\nresulted from the recent - (what\ncan only be called) - balls-up\nregarding Roberts Construction\nLtd. the affects of which are still\nbeing felt by I.C. interviewees.\nThe motion on job recruitment\nwas being discussed in a rational\n(if not slightly tepid) manner\nwhen Mary( may God protect her\nsoul) decided to call quorum.

And so it came to pass that\nwe ventured northwards to the land of\nCamden to the Electric Ballroom. Star\ndate - Saturday night. Captain's log;\nEveryone was talking about it, \" The Rough Trade Package\" a collection of\nnew interesting bands organized by\nKensington's alternative record label\nRough Trade.\nUnfortunately everyone else had the\nsame idea and the room was densely\npacked with all shapes, colours and\nsizes.\nFirst on was Robert Rental and the\nNor malawi erd electronic duo. The noises\nthey managed to produce were strong,\nry th mic, powerful, monotonous and ultimately enjoyable.\nThat was the good news now the bad news,\nthe music between the acts. Why should it be\ncommon practice to play unending reggae\nover and over again at such events? One or\ntwo tracks maybe, but not all night! I suppose\nthough it does make you appreciate the real\nmusic when the bands come on.\nNext came Essential Logic led by their\nvocalist and saxophonist Lora Logic. Lora's previous claim to fame was with X Ray Spex\ntwo years ago and she's only eighteen now. I saw the group a couple of months ago when\nthey had just been formed and were nervous,\nand troubled, but obviously talented..\nTonight they were bursting with confidence\nand still troubled with the sound but the\ntalent was still there. Watch out for their\nimpending single \" Wake Up\" a sure fire hit,\nand if you haven't got Miss Logic's minor cult\nhit, Aerosol Burns yet, why not?\nMore reggae and then for a change some I reggae.\nThen cheers and enter stage right Belfast's answer to the Brotherhood of Man, Stiff\nLittle Fingers Agreed they're not as well\nknown yet but its only a matter of time and as\na consolation the music's a bit better. S. L.F. play straight forward fast punk music with a message; the situation in Ulster isn't perfect\nbut fighting won't solve anything. Who can\nargue with that, certainly no one at the\nElectric Ballroom. Anyone wishing to lose\nsome weight should spend an evening there,\nand join in the mindless po going at the front.\nNever were so many calories lost by so few so j quickly. Tracks from the new album\nInflammable Material came thick and fast,\nall were ex hill a rating, especially the singles\nSuspect Device and Alternative Ulster. But\nwhen the music is so fast so is the passage of\ntime and soon came the end of the set. But\nthere was no way that was the end of the\nnight's activites.\nThey returned to encore with 'Rough\nTrade' a tirade against the established music /\nbusiness and finally the line up was added to\nwith a guest guitarist from the T.R. B.,a stiff\nlittle thumb. They ended with a true punk\nanthem the Clash's White Riot and everyone\nwent wild.\nThen it was over we returned to the\nEnterprise hot and tired and gave Sunday\nmorning a miss. ,\nOver .and out. !\nP.S.T. E. Lawrence \" The Mint\"( Penguin 95 p232 pages)\nT.E. Lawrence entered the Royal Air Force depot at Uxbridge in mid-August\n1922, under the assumed name John\nHume Ross.\nPrevious to this, he had been at the\nColonial Office as Adviser to Winston\nChurchill on Middle Eastern Affairs,\nfollowing his work with the Arabs during the Arab Revolt, and the\ncreation of the Arab States. A distinguished career at the Foreign\nOffice was assured, but he left to revise\nhis account of the Arab Revolt, \"Seven\nPillars of Wisdom\", and to enter the\nranks of the R.A.F. When he took his medical, he was aged 34,\nand in an emaciated and depressed state. He had been wounded seven times in Arabia,\nand was exhausted by his rewriting of \"Seven\nPillars of Wisdom\". It was only by calling on\nthe influence of his friend, Sir Hugh Trenchard, the Chief of Air Staff, that he\nmanaged to get in at all.\nThe first part of \" The Mint\" describes his\nexperiences during his basic training at\nUxbridge. This part of the book was written\nfrom notes made at the time, and describes\nhis day to day existence with unerring\naccuracy, including the full brunt of barrack-room language. The physical hardship and\ndegradation are described in a hard, precise\nmanner, or as Lawrence described his work\n\"an iron, rectangular abhorrent book\".\nIn January1923, Lawrence was\ndischarged because the press discovered his\nREVIEW - British Rail's Streamlined, Nuclear,\nSubsonic, stopping at all stations and some\nin between, train for advanced passengers.\nThis Friday I had my first adventure (non-erotic) on board\" a Dueiug 707 British Rail\nblue and yellow train. (The one that's pointed\nat both ends). With great excitement I strode\ndown platform 6 at Kings Cross - realized my\nmistake, and went to platform 4 where the\ntrain was. Having first walked the length of\nthe wondrous train, I boarded the carriage\nthat had the most young, pretty girls on.\nI knew full well that none of them would be\nable to resist my charms - especially when I pulled my FELIX proudly from my battered,\nbroken rucksack. So I sat back, languishing>\nin the comfort of blue BR upholstery, and\"\npeering over the top of my FELIX to catch the\neye of the girl in the corner, (I threw it back),!\nwinked at her in my most seductive manner.\nMy eyes flashed from the toilet behind her to\nher eyes and back, hoping she would get my\nmessage (I spent my youth reading\nunprintable mucky books). I must have been\nsuccessful because she promptly fell asleep\nfor the rest of the journey!\nBored, I looked out of the window - we'd stopped in Hitchin - marvellous - only we\nweren't supposed to stop there. I think the\ndriver had gone for a pee. Have you ever\nstopped to consider how the driver manages\nwhen he's driving at 120 m.p.h. down the\nstraight, and sudden t ly gets an un control able urge. He can't go out the window - so he stops\nat the next convenient station (ur rg g h).L \u2014 \u2014 BOOK REVIEW real identity, and entered the Tank Corps.\nHowever, after veiled suicide threats, he reentered the R.A.F. in August 1925, and\nserved at Cranwell Cadet College until\nMarch,1927. He was then transferred to\nIndia, just as \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\" was\nbeing published.\nThe second, much shorter, part ofthe book\ndescribes his time at Cranwell. The writing\nflows in a lighter, more fluent way, reflecting\nthe much better conditions at this\nestablishment.\nThis part of the book may reflect\nLawrence's loyalty to the R.A.F., and some\ncritics found it detracted from the power of\nthe earlier part ofthe book. Personally, I did\nnot find this so.\n\" The Mint\" is one of Lawrence's major\nworks, not only being an account of the\nconditions in the R.A.F., but also providing\nan insight into the reasons why Lawrence\nentered the a irl or ce. Some of them\nwere certainly tied up with his wish to write a book on R.A.F. life from the bottom, a task\ncut short by the press. It was also a search for\ncontentment after self-doubt about his\nachievements in the Middle East, and the\nquality of \"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\". He found this contentment in the services, and it\nwas not until he left them that he fell again\ninto deep depression, and was killed in a motor cycle accident in 1935.\n\" The Mint\" remains the window into the\nlife of one of the most colourful men of this\ncentury.\nJan H. Kool That's how most BR timetables operate. They\nestimate the time it takes for a driver to want\n9\u00b0 fo_r a Pe\ne, work out the average speed of\nthe train, and find a major station for the train\nto stop at, at that particular distance. Only\nwhen the Keg in the engine is Watneys, and\nnot the usual Theakstons, the drivers have to\nstop more frequently - hence delays and\nstopping at non-scheduled stations.\nAfter a while they turned up the heat in the\ncarriage so more people would buy cold\ndrinks, so I toddled off to the buffet. Shockhorror-surprise- the Buffet served hot meals,\nKeg beer, and little bottles of tonic water, and\nthere were actually 5 people behind the\ncounter to serve. This illusion was shattered\nwhen only one man did the serving, and the\nother 4 watched him, offering helpful\nsuggestions.\nThe thing that impressed me most, though,\nwas the PA system. After we had pulled out of\nKings Cross the PA went, \"Crackle-Crackle-Dis ab de Chief steward on dees train, de\nbuffa y car am open.\" At least I think that's what it said ' cos the \"crackle-crackle\"\ncontinued until the thing was switched off,\nI must say that it was the most pleasant trip I have had on any train all over the world (well-the best BR ride I 've had).\nRemember BR makes sense - I don't.( Written on Intercity train to Leeds) D. Stutchfield ME II.'\nP.S.I apologise for any racist or sexist\nsentiments but you get very bored on a train.\nBR Advanced Passenger Train\n\n"

But the worthy members of\nR CSU remained undaunted\nby this minor mishap and\nproceeded to ratify the\nin quo rate election never the less. An objection that one of\nthe ballot boxes was open\nduring polling and the others\nhad had their keys attached\nwas speedily dismissed.\nSean O 'Boyle was the clear\nvictor in the Presidential election.\nHe is currently R CSU Assistant\nHonorary Secretary and has been\nvery active in the Union since\ncoming to IC two years ago.\nThe other elections were much\nmore closely fought.

Sara was narrowly beaten\nby Bryan Stephenson. Bryan was\nelected publicity officer by 105\nvotes to 101.\nBefore the elections Mark Corrigan told the meeting that\nGuilds may not be able to take\npart in this year's Lord Mayor's Show because they have not been\nallowed free entry. However if\n/'800 can be raised by industrial\nsponsorship then there will still be\na chance of Guilds taking part.\nIronically Mines have been\ninvited to enter the Show and.\nthe v will be sponsored.\nHl J STiNG^ U GM The final step towards a Sabbatical Deputy president was\ntaken last week when an IC Union\nMeeting gave a second reading to\nthe required Union byelaw\nchanges.\nDespite several questions\nregarding the financing of the\npost the proposal was passed\nwithout opposition.\nMethods of raising the money\ninclude the setting up of a discount scheme and increased\nincome from pinball machines.\nThe meeting also accepted the\nnew job description for the\nDeputy President which includes\nthe job of Junior Treasurer.\nThe meeting, in which the main\nitem on the agenda was the\nsabbatical election hustings, also\ndiscussed a controversial motion\non job recruitment, which ended\nin Union President Mary Attenborough successfully challenging the quorum.\nThe motion proposed by Mark\nClegg referred to a recruitment\nvisit to College by the South\nAfrican company Roberts Construction and sought to limit\nfuture action by the Union against\nany company interviewing at\nCollege.\nTwo amendments to the motion\nwere defeated. The first, by Paul\nFairbairn Editor of FORWARD!, asked the Union to press College\nnot to invite companies recruiting\nfor South African jobs because of\ndiscrimination against the 25 per\ncent of coloured IC students.\nThe second amendment proposed by Mary Attenborough\ncalled for a peaceful picket of\ninterviews by South African\ncompanies.\nShe said that she would not\nnormally challenge the quorum\nsimply because she disagreed\nwith a motion. But in this case she\nfelt that there were many difficult\nquestions involved which had not\nbeen fully discussed. To actively\nencourage any company of any\nnature to recruit in College was a very sweeping statement and too\nserious a decision to be taken at\nan in quo rate meeting.\nThe motion was due to be\ndiscussed again at yesterday's Union meeting.\nDOWNSTAIRS\nRECORDS & TAPES BOUGHT\nSOLD & EXCHANGED\nBEST PRICES PAID\n\u2022\nSHADY'S RECORD LIBRARY\n\u2022\nBIG DISCOUNTS ON SELECTED\nLP's PLUS A GOOD\nSELECTION OF CUT-OUT'S& OVER-RUNS\n\u2022\nPOSTERS, BADGES\n& COLLECTOR'S SINGLES\nMUSIC MARKET\nINCORPORATING\" SHADY DEALS\"20 HIGH STREET, PUTNEY, LONDON, SW15 NEW RELEASE & CHART SINGLES ONLY 70p LARGE SELECTION OF IMPORT LP's,7\"&12\" SINGLES\nlOO O's OF GOLDEN OLDIE SINGLES INC.

    "content": "IMPERIAL COLLEGE 1ST vs THAMES VALLEY: 4-1\nAlter dropping off the second and third teams to play their ill-fated\ngames against Richmond the first team proceeded to the Thames Valley\nground.\nThis was a top of the table clash with Thames Valley having to hold\nI.C. to a draw to be certain of promotion.\nWe arrived to find the water table rising and that the home team had\nnot yet rowed out to put up the posts.\nIt would appear that I.C., who are\nused to playing on some of the\nbest pitches in London, would\nhave to beat the pitch as well as\nthe opposition. However they rose\nto it quickly putting on the\npressure, not allowing the ball to\nstick in the mud or the opposition\nto settle. In the first half I.C. showed greater determination\nand an eagerness to get forward that often found Bob Middleton in the offside trap.\nImperial opened the score sheet\nwith two goals worked from short\ncorners.\nThe second half began with\nThames Valley making an all out\npush. Imperial soaked up the\npressure for ten minutes before\nletting in a goal. Although it could\nhave been avoided it took the\nsteam out of the attack and\nrevitalized the I.C. effort. After a period of hard and fast play by\nboth sides I.C. took control after;\ntheir third goal. The constant\nonslaught brought a fourth goal\nand a justifiable score line. The\nscorers were Bob Middleton with\na hat-trick, and a jug, and Andy\nHares. Commiserations to Mark\nButton, and the wooden spoon,\nfor missing a penalty.\nImperial have only to win the\nmatch on Saturday against\nBorough Rd. College, to get\npromotion.\nThe team were: - G. Corbin, I. Crowe, S. Boat, G. Street, M, Buttons, T. Creek, A. Hares, D. Hatter, B. Middleton, T. Debarr, J. Pratt, umpire: D. Dawe\nNovel Beast\nI Last Saturday, the Cross\nCountry Club ran in the final race\nin the Reebok League, at Oxford.\nYet again, the turnout was very\npoor, however it was great to see\nRich Green at the course when we\narrived in Mrs. Acford's car.\nThe course was a six-mile mud-bath, suitable more for bike\nscrambling than cross-country\nrunning. A very fast start left most\nof the IC team wallowing at the\nback of the field. Rich Green was\nthe first IC runner to finish in an\nexcellent 27th considering the\ndifficult conditions. Bryan Acford,\nencouraged by the pleas from his\nmum to keep his kit clean, kept his\nbalance and finished 48th. Ian\nMorton had other ideas. Emulating his performance at\nI~ Last Friday, I.C.I played\ntheir first Middlesex League\nmatch of the season against\nPENGUIN II. A weakened I.C. team took the pool expecting\na hard game.\nIn the first quarter play was\nvery close, the PENGUIN team,\nbeing fairly fast but without much\nimagination. The only goal\nscored was by Cliff Spooner,\nputting I.C.10 up.\nThis was the score at half time,\nthe second quarter being goalless.\nThe third quarter however,\nproduced more goals. First, Pete\nMcCartney scored with a long\nshot while PENGUIN had a man\nsent out- Then Cliff Spooner\nCROSSCOUNTRY Stirling, he proceeded to fall over\non various parts of the course, and\ncrawled (literally) his way round\nto finish a dismally pathetic 65th. Special mention must go however\nfor his attempt at setting up yet\nanother everyday challenge for\n\"Persil's\" biological action. Ian\nAl vey and Rich Harrington completed the team, but Gary\nLonghurst found the going tough,\nand was one of the many who failed to finish.\nThe final league results, showed that IC had finished 8th out of 19 University and college\nteams, and were the second\ncollege team, finishing behind\nOxford Poly, which was a bit\ndisappointing.\nIan Morton\n\u2014 WATER POLO scored his second to increase I.C.'s lead. But PENGUIN'S counter\nattacking brought its reward at\nthe end of the quarter, one of their\nplayers arrived in front of goal\nunmarked to make the score 3-1.\nThe last quarter started with\nI.C. trying to hang on to their 2\ngoal lead. This was increased by\nMike McCartney who scored\nwith a hard shot into the corner of\nthe goal. PENGUIN pulled a goal\nback again with a long shot, but\nthey were kept away from\nshooting positions for the most\npart, and 4-2 was the final score.\nTeam: K. Ribar, A. Smith, C. Spooner, S. Tayler, D. Chadwick, T. Rockingham, P. McCartney, M. McCartney.\nFirstly, a notice to all members,\nthere will be the Table Tennis\nClub Annual General Meeting on\nWednesday 21st of March to elect\nthe officers for 1979-80. Papers\nwill be up in the T.T. room in a few\ndays' time for nominations.\nMeanwhile more pearls of prose\nfrom the matchless match-reporting writer.\nI.C.I7 EAGLE II (Home) 2\nFrom 2-1 down, the firsts\nclawed their way back into the\nmatch, with the result that they\nkeep alive their hopes of\npromotion. La khani and Singarajah both lost to different\nopponents, while Hong won his\nthree sets.\nI.C. IV 3\nSAINSBURYS (away) 6\nThis result finally sealed the fate\nof the fourth team, now doomed to\ndivision 6 for eternity (well,\nanother year anyway). Lambert\nand Cobrin both played like\ncorpses (dead ones at that!), but\nRutherford stared the spectre of\ndefeat firmly in the mouth and\ntriumphed valiantly yet one more\ntime (if this isn't the biggest load\nof....)\nI.C. Ill 7\nMARKS & SPENCER (away) _ 2\nThe thirds went shopping for\nthree easy points in this match.\nStean won his sets comfortably,\n2 2 ND Reed won two, having not slept for\ntwo days (silly br) and Hewkin\nconsidered his record of having\nnever missed Faulty Towers more\nimportant than beating an opponent he had beaten twice\nalready - and so gave away his\nfinal set (the match had been won\n7-1 by that time). An attempt was\nmade to relieve M and S of a sign\nor two, but the alarms (being\ntested coincidentally with the\nattempted theft) scared me to\ndeath!\nI.C.

    "content": "Page9 Mary's Muttering s This week's story involves scholarships. We entered the\ncontroversy about scholarships at the Board of Studies\nmeeting held on the 18th October, 1978. At the meeting some\nnew scholarship arrangements were recommended.\nThere arc currently 35 scholarships available lor award on the results\nol the College scholarship examination held in January each year. 10 ol\nthese scholarships are available for three years at the value of \u00a375 per\nannum. The remaining 25 scholarships, also valued at \u00a375 are available\nfor only one year. In addition there are 55 Imperial College scholarships\nawarded on the results of the first year examinations, such scholars\nreceive \u00a375 per annum in the second and third year of their course. The proposal put to Board of Studies would, however, increase these\nscholarships quite considerably, to five scholarships at \u00a3500 per annum for the duration of an undergraduate course and 25 scholarships at \u00a3250\nper annum for the duration of an undergraduate course. There is also a proposal to put the first year scholarships up to \u00a3100 each, to be\nawarded for the final two years.\nThe new proposals would cost\nabout \u00a320,000 per year more than\nthe existing arrangement. It was\nfor this reason that a Union General Meeting passed policy\nagainst the new proposals\npointing out that if scholarships\nwere to be given to anybody they\nwould be better given to people\nwho had no means of support and\nbe of a level able to keep them\nthrough a course. In the case of\nundergraduates this would, of\ncourse, be overseas students. We\nobjected also to the idea of using\nmonetary incentive to people who\nit was not necessarily known to be\nin financial difficulties in order to\nbring them to the College.\nCollege should be able to attract\nstudents on the basis of its\nacademic reputation.\nIt was this objection to the new-scheme that led us to 170 Queen's Gate last Wednesday, 7th March, in order to chat with six members\nof the academic stall plus the\nRector. When I say we. I mean\nmyself, (not surprisingly), Roger\nStotesbury, Academic Allairs\nOfficcri Bob Hart, C and GU Academic Allairs Officer, Steve\nRuane, R CSU Academic Affairs\nOfficer, Peter Bamlord, standing\nin for Mines Academic Affairs\nOfficer, and Mike the Elk. We\nargued vociferously, with the\nexception of the Mines Rep. that\nif such money was available it\nwould be better put to other\npurposes either as suggested in the\nU GM motion to lull-support\nscholarships for overseas students,\nor to other projects which would\nbenefit the whole student body.\nThe main example of the need for\nfinance quoted was the need for\nmore student housing. \u00a320,000\ncould finance a long-term lease on\ntwo-thirds of a student house per\nyear. We also pointed out that\nthere were obvious benefits in\nhaving more housing in that\naccommodation was the major\nthing that put people off coming\nto London and that they could\nproduce no evidence to show the\nscholarships made any overall\ndifference to the standard of\nstudent life in the College. The\nstaff representatives argued, however, that the odd scholar in a class added a great deal to the\nquality of student discussion in a class and argued that they did not\nneed to prove this but that we, on\nthe contrary, should prove that\nother ways of spending finance,\ne.g. student housing, would be of\nmuch greater benefit.\nIn general the meeting only\nmaintained the status quo.\nneither side convincing the other.\nIt looks like the proposals will\ntherefore come into effect quite\nsoon. It was at the end of the\nmeeting that we learned the latest\nshock horror story about overseas\nstudents and the directive from\nthe University- Grants Committee\nto cut down numbers by 7% from\nthe 75/76 level.

As usual, the devious mind of\nCliff Spooner came up with an\namusing novelty race that was\nvery popular among the\nswimmers and equally amusing\nfor the spectators. After several\nheats and semi-finals, the final\nwas very closely fought with the\nRCS swimmer victorious.\nGuilds won all the men's events\nwith several good lower placings\nand were convincing winners of\nthe two relay events.

The bottle, a trophy of Mines'\nrecent victory against Camborne\nin the bottle match, was behind\nthe Union bar when the raiders\nstruck on Thursday night. Mingling with the drinkers they\nwaited for a moment when the\nbar stall' were fully occupied.\nSuddenly they dashed under\nthe counter, grabbed the bottle\nand pushed their way out through\nthe crowd. An attempt to stop\nthem resulted in the rescue of the\nbottom part of the bottle.\nAlter running at top speed\nacross Beit Quad they got away\non motorbikes along Prince\nConsort Road.

    "content": "Page5 PG Tips\nA few months ago I passed on\ninformation from the National\nUnion of Students to the effect\nthat Postgraduate demonstrating\nrates had been set at \u00a32.74 per\nhour. N Several people have since\nwondered why this College is still\npaying last year's rate of \u00a32.59.\nThe demonstrating rate is\nlinked to the bottom point of the\nlecturers' pay scale following an\nagreement between the Committee of Vice Chancellors and\nPrincipals, the Association of\nUniversity Teachers and the NUS. From 1st October lecturers\nhave been awarded a6.1 percent\nacademic \"anomaly\" payment,\nprior to a national settlement of\ntheir salary scales. This rise paid\nto postgraduates would result in\n\u00a32.74 per hour.\nHowever this College has\ndecided not to award the 6.1 per\ncent increase now and further\nadjust the rate after the national\nsettlement. Instead the whole\nincrease will be applied in one go\nand backdated to 1st October\n1978.\nThis means that the final rate\nwill be more than \u00a32.74 per hour\nbut postgraduates will have to\nwait until the summer term before\nreceiving a large backdated\npayment.\nLast year when the same\nsituation occurred departments\nmade the backdated payments\nautomatically. But there could be\ncomplications for students doing\nirregular demonstrating outside\ntheir departments and it is worth\nnoting how much work you have\ndone.\nCollege's explanation of the\narrangement seems satisfactory\nto me at this moment but I shall\nraise the question again if there is\nno agreement of a new demonstrating rate by May.\nDepartmental Groups\nDepartmental postgraduate groups are entitled to a grant from\nthe IC Postgraduate Group to\nassist in organising their own\nactivities, social or otherwise.\nVery few groups have taken up\nthis option.\nIt is not too late to apply for\nmoney now. Groups should apply\nto me (c/o IC Union Office) or\nMike Wort (Min Tech PG), stating\nhow much money they would like\nand for what purpose.\nPloughman's Lunch\nThe next PG plough man's lunch will be on 2nd April in the\nUnion Senior Common Room.\nThis one will be even better value\nthan the last, i.e. same price -more food. Tickets will be on sale\nsoon.\nSonia Hochfelder\nPostgraduate Affairs Officer\nIC Community\nAction Group\nJust a few items for your\nattention this week, Pm sorry\nfor the absence of ICCA G articles in recent weeks, I 've\nbeen feeling a bit lazy\nrecently, but here goes.\nThe first thing is that I 've\npromised to bring some people\nalong to help redecorate some of\nthe rooms at a place called\n\"Providence Row\" down by\nLiverpool Street main line\nstation. 50 Crispin Street to be\nexact. This establishment takes\ncare ofthe poor, the destitute and\nthe homeless and is run by the\nSisters of Mercy. At the risk of\nproducing too long an article,\nbelow are the objects of the\nrefuge.\n1) to provide a free night's lodging, supper, breakfast and\nwashing facilities for all genuine\napplicants, men and women.\n2) to allow applicants who are\nactively seeking work to remain\nuntil work is found.\n3) to provide lodging, washing\nand cooking facilities for homeless\nfamilies until accommodation is\nfound.\n4) to help persons in or out of\nthe refuge to rehabilitate themselves.\n5) to provide a home for women\nand girls.\n6) to supply sandwiches to\nhungry persons coming to the\ndoors of the Refuge and food\nparcels to poor families.\n7) to assist Providence (Row)\nFamilies Housing Association to\nprovide accommodation for\nhomeless families.\n8) to provide Hostel accommodation for business girls\nand students at moderate charges.\nI could go on to quote the\nachievements side of their leaflet\nbut I 've got other things to say\nand space is running short.\nBy the way, the venue for this\npainting is, leave from the Union arc j a it 9.45 am. this Sunday,\nthe ' 8 th March. There is going to be a TaskForce Special this Saturday\n(subject to confirmation) in which\nwe are going to concentrate all\nour efforts on the one job of\ntidying up the house of an old\ncouple in Notting Hill.

Obviously at the time\nhe possessed quite strong feelings\non the subject - as did I when I wrote the editorial comment. By\ndoing so I was exercising my right\nof freedom of expression, which I fear would be removed if Jan Czernuszka's qua zi Eastern bloc\npolitics were adopted in Britain.\nYours faithfully,\nMartin Sladdin (spelt with\ntwo 'd's)' Morning Cloud' editor\nDear Sir, - As a fairly regular\nlistener to Imperial College\nRadio, I must express my\ndisappointment at the recent\nprogramming changes. These\nalterations have removed the\n'Specialist Programmes' from 9-11 slot and condensed them into\nthree 1-hour transmissions.\nAmong other things, this has\nresulted in the replacement of the\n' Rhythm and Blues' and classical\nmusic programmes (both of which\nwill be missed by many) by 'Prole-Feed' mindless pop which caters\nfor the lowest common denominator and surely only\npleases those whose requests are\nread out - while nobody gets a chance to hear some new,\ndifferent music, enthusiastically\nintroduced by a knowledgeable\ndevotee, as was previously the\ncase.\nTo my mind, the central issue\nhere resembles the BBC2/ ITV Contrast - should we replace\n'Panorama' by a banal ' SitCom'( or 'The Old Grey Whistle-Test'\nby 'Crossroads') merely because\nthe latter alternatives require less\nmental effort from potential\naudiences? Obviously some\ncompromise is inevitable until\nI.C. Radio2(!?) hits the airwaves\n(with continuous current-affairs,\nor live relays of bar nights from the\nUnion Bar?) But please bring\nback ' R and B' and 'Opus 301'!\nLet us remember minorities, and\nencourage any individualism in\nthis college whose students can so\neasily end their courses and find\nthemselves grey, lifeless stereo\ntypes\nMick Berry\nFalmouth Hall Dear Sir, - We have seen a lot\nabout the Unification Church( commonly called the \" Moon ies\" by the media) in the papers\nrecently. Yet very little remains\nknown about this group. There\nhave been allegations of people\nbeing kidnapped, brainwashed,\nand separated from their families.\nAs a member ofthe Unification\nChurch, Iam interested in\nmaking clear to the students at IC exactly what my position is, and\nin answering some of these\nallegations, based on my personal\nexperience.\nFirstly, I would like to say that I have never been kidnapped (for\nhere I am, still studying for my\ndegree).\nAs for brainwashing, I have\nconsidered at great length the\nclaims ofthe Unification Church, the justifications used by the\nChurch for those claims, and the\nunderlying organisation behind\ntheir teachings. After a fair\namount of time, I came to agree\nwith their views. I was in no way\ni pressurized in fact I did a lot of\nresearch into the philosophical\ntheory of the Church on my own.\nRegarding my family, I found\nthat my parents were initially\nalarmed and presented me with a lot of anti-Moonie literature,\nwhich I took into consideration in\nmy decision. Since joining the\nMoonies, I have in fact seen a lot\nmore of my parents than before\n(e.g. they insisted on seeing me at\nleast once a week for some time\nafter I told them). As to family\nrelations, my parents and I have\nhad much deeper discussions\nabout God, philosophy, and the\nmeaning of life than we ever had\nbefore.\nSo I can honestly say that the\nUnification Church has brought\nme closer to my parents. I have\nnever been taught to hate my\nparents. If anyone wishes to find\nout more about the Moonies, I suggest they attend the meeting\nthis Friday in Elec. Eng.508 at\n12.30.\nYours,\nPaul Wright\nElec Eng III\nTo all members of R.C. S.U.I offer my sincere apologies for my\nnon appearance as returning\nofficer at the results meeting for\nthe Royal College of Science\nUnion elections on the ninth of\nMarch. This was caused by an\nunforgivable oversight on my part\nand I deeply regret any inconvenience or strain caused to the\ncandidates.\nYours,\nM. Maghar Dear Sir, - Iam shocked to find\nthat the price of 'scotch eggs' in\nthe Union refectory is more\nexpensive than Harrolds. Even at\na delicatessen in Fulham Rd they\nare 22 p compared to 28 p in the\nrefectory. Furthermore cooked\nsausages are a staggering \u00a31.12\nper lb. I think its disgusting.\nYours faithfully,\nF. Bongolia\n\n"

Contact the Welfare Centre for details.\nSupplementary Benefit\nIf you are getting a grant or if your parents are supposed to be\ncontributing to your grant, you won't be eligible for the Supplementary\nBenefit living allowance this vacation, although you will in the Summer.\nIf you are not getting a grant, because, for example, you are repeating a year, then you will be able to claim. Overseas students who are here on a visa are not entitled to claim and a claim in such circumstances could\nmean that your visa won't be renewed, if the Home Office find out.\nEven if you are not entitled to the living allowance, because of the\nVacation element in the grant, you may be able to claim for the rent that\nyou are paying over the vacation. To do this, however, you will have to\nsign on in London and then sign on here each week. Theoretically it is\npossible to get a 'holiday form' if you want to go home but this practice is\nfrowned upon by the Supplementary Benefit Commission when it is\nsimply a way of getting round the provisions for not paying students\nwho go home during the vacation. If you sign on at home for the rent you\nare paying in London you should get a \u00a32 retainer, which hardly pays\nthe bus fare to get to the office to sign on!\nHow much can you get?\nTo work out your entitlement, they add the living allowance to which\nyou are entitled and the Rent (up to a certain level which varies from\narea to area, usually \u00a310 - \u00a315) and subtract the vacation element.\nThere are three different rates for single people's living allowances.\nHouseholder Rate: - If you are responsible for the outgoing s etc of the\nplace you live in, the rate is \u00a312.45 per week.\nSharer Rate: - This is \u00a312.45 plus the difference between the\nhouseholder rate and non-householder rate (\u00a33.10) divided by the\nnumber of share rs. Lodging rate : - It is not clear whether bed and breakfast\naccommodation counts as lodgings. The rate is \u00a35.05 per week plus\nabout 80 pence for any meal which is not provided. If you live in a hotel\nwhere you don't get breakfast, you will get the lodgings rate and 60 p for\neach breakfast.\nExamples: 1) Fred is on a grant and shares a flat with three others,\npaying \u00a317 per week, rent. If he signs on in London he will get \u00a312.45\nplus a quarter of \u00a33.10 which comes to \u00a313.22. Supposing the rent limit\nin his area is \u00a312 per week, he will get \u00a313.22 plus \u00a312 less \u00a313.90\n(vacation element of the grant) which leaves \u00a311.22.\n2) Archie is on a grant and lives in bed and breakfast accommodation,\npaying \u00a312 per week. If he is treated as a non-householder, he will get\n\u00a312.45 plus \u00a312 rent (though this depends on the area he lives in -see\nabove) less \u00a313.90 which gives him \u00a310.55 per week. If he is treated as a lodger, he will get \u00a35.50 plus 14 meals at 80 p. which comes to \u00a311.20\nplus the \u00a312 rent less \u00a313.90 which comes to \u00a314.80, which is quite a bit\nhigher than the \u00a310.55 so its worth doing the calculations before you try\nto convince the D.H.S. S. as to which category you fall into.\nUnemployment Benefit\nIf you claimed Unemployment Benefit at Christmas and got it, then\nyou will get the same amount this Easter. If you claimed at Christmas\nand didn't get it, or claimed Supplementary Benefit and didn't get any\nUnemployment Benefit, you won't get it at Easter either. This is\nbecause of the 13 week rule which treats two clair rts made within\nthirteen weeks of each other as the same claim. Tpe thirteen week\nperiod starts from the end of the first claim.\nIf you are starting afresh, the tax year in which you have to have paid\nthe requisite number of National Insurance contributions is the one\nending April 1978. To be entitled to the full benefit rate, you would have\nto have paid contributions on earnings of \u00a3750 during that tax year. If\nyou earned over half that amount, you will be entitled to half the full rate\nand there is also a three quarter rate. The full rate is \u00a315.75 per week.\nHow to Claim\nYou can claim Unemployment Benefit at home or in London but you\nhave to claim Supplementary Benefit from the office which is local to\nyour term time address. If your Unemployment Benefit entitlement\nexceeds your Supplementary Benefit entitlement, there is no point in\nclaiming supplementary benefit, as the latter simply operates to top up\nwhat you get from other sources. The procedure for claiming\nSupplementary Benefit is to look in the 'phone book under Health and\nSocial Security, and find the office nearest to your term time address,\nring them, check whether they deal with your address and make an\nappointment for the first day of the vacation or as soon after as you can.\nAsk them which is the nearest Unemployment Benefit office (also listed\nunder Employment, Department of, in the 'phone book) and ask\nwhether there is a job centre that you have to goto first. Visit the offices\nin the order 1) Job centre if there is one, 2) Unemployment Benefit\nOffice, 3) Social Security Office, getting the first two done in time for\nyour interview. For your interview, you will have to take with you, to\nshow the interviewer, proof of earnings and savings and that you are a student. YojJ will also need your Rent Book or your tenancy\nagreement/licence. If you don't have any of these you should try and get\na letter from your landlord on headed notepaper confirming that you are\npaying rent over the vacation. If you can't get any of these, tell the\ninterviewer that this is the case and, with 'our landlord's permission,\ngive them your landlord's 'phone number and insist that they ring the\nlandlord for confirmation. They will usually do this in the end although\nthey sometimes need a lot of persuading.\nTo claim Unemployment Benefit you simply go along to the Job Centre - where you have to pretend to look for a job - and then to the\nUnemployment Benefit Office and it doesn't matter which one you go\nto.\nIf this all seems incredibly complicated clarification can be obtained\nfrom the Welfare Centre on the third floor of the Union Building.\nMichael Arthur\nWelfare Adviser\nAccommodation for next Session\nThe University of London Accommodation Office is now under new\nmanagement. Miss Pyle-Howard, the new Accommodation Officer at\nthe Malet Street Branch is proposing to make two important changes\nwhich will affect students seeking their services next session. Firstly,\nsecond and third year students will no longer be excluded from their\nhelp for the first few weeks of the session and also they now have a noticeboard where vacancies are advertised which should make life a lot easier for everyone.\nIt is not yet clear how far these changes will affect the procedure at the\nPrinces Gardens Branch.\nBelow is the text of a circular issued , by the University\nAccommodation office regarding procedure for next session.\nAccommodation for the next session - Procedure for current students\nSingle Students Rooms\nThose seeking single or double rooms for September/October should\ncall at the Accommodation Office in late May/early June allowing\nthemselves a few free days to look at the accommodation. (Flats for one\nperson, ie room and kitchen or more, are included here, but they are\nvery difficult to find and expensive). A retaining fee does not have to be\npaid for this type of accommodation when it is booked in advance. After\nthe end of term priority is given to students who will be new to London.\nCurrent students who have not found accommodation by then,\nhowever, consult the notice board in the Accommodation Office.\nSingle students Flats\nAny accommodation larger than one room with cooking facilities is\nconsidered a flat. Only very few owners of such property will take a booking for the next session without charging full rent during the\nvacation. Unless the group is able to pay rent from late June/early July it\nis unlikely that a flat will be found before the end of term, but enquiries\ncan be made from late May onwards. Otherwise, the search should start\nabout four weeks before the rent can be paid and the earlier in\nSeptember this is the better. It is advisable to allow at least a few days to\nfind a flat; in September it is often possible to book temporary\naccommodation in the Halls of Residence whilst seeking a flat for the\nterm.\nMarried students\nCurrent students requiring accommodation for a couple or family are\nadvised to try and find it in July or August rather than leave it until\nSeptember. It is generally fruitless to start looking more than four weeks\nbefore the rent can first be paid. Addresses cannot be sent out of\nLondon and the mailing list service is generally suspended in late July.\n\n"

The\nteam comprised of Stroppy (the\n8 th dwarf, Grumpy' s twin! brother), Johann Sebastian Cruyff, M.F. Walrus, Luigi Ravioli Magh yar, Christopher\nRobin, and Rastus AdolfO ding a Odin ga. This was (slightly) a grudge match, a Q.M. C. player\nhaving told us earlier in the\nseason: \"Wail until you come to our\nplace.'\" We, therefore, went well\nprepared: Luigi took his whip,\nand we also took a screw-driver^?).\nThe matches were fairly\nuneventful, except that when\nRastus played his frame, he was\nrewarded with threats of being;\nwhipped when he missed easy\nshots, and shouts of \"More molasses\ntonight, Rastus\", for good shots.\nAfter the match, the team\nentertained the Q.M. C. students\nin their Union bar with a little\nshow of flagellation. They then\nproceeded to the tube station with\nthe chant: \"We all agree, Q.M. C. are w 'nk'rs!\" By this time, all the\nteam members, barring Rastus\nwho had only drunk one orange\njuice (\"Disgusting\", said the\nWalrus), had each consumed\nabout seven pints, and so the train\ncompartment was booming with\nrugby, er-snooker songs all the\nway home, much to the\namusement (?) of the other\npassengers.\nAnd they lived happily ever\nafter!\n( Many thanks to those regulars of\nthe ' B' team who are leaving I.C. this year: A.Lec l ezio, J.

    "content": "Page17 THIRDS FIELD A FULL TEAM!\nI.C. ill 2 vs U.C. II 1\nSaturday 10th March\nThe previous two matches saw the thirds lose to L.S.E. with 9 men,\nand miss the Harlington coach to play Bedford II with 7 men. The uninformed reader might think of this as a disaster, but I can exclusively\nreveal that this was yet another deliberate ploy of that tactical genius,\nplayer-manager Dave Hall.\nWhile championship contenders U.C. II were confidently expecting\nvictory over an 8-men team or a walk-over, Dave Hall revealed his\nmasterplan: -He put 11 names on the team-sheet, and booked transport to\nHarlington!\nLo and behold, on Saturday\nmorning, 11 sober players and a coach were at the Union. This was\nobviously beyond skipper Hall's wildest dreams, as he had only\nbrought 9 red shirts! Despite this\nminor setback the team boarded\nthe right coach and arrived at\nHarlington.\nGiles Brereton, who is invariably still putting his boots on while the team kicks off, was first\nchanged, and soon the new-look\n11-man version of I.C. Ill took to\nthe pitch. The back three became\nthe back four; the forward line\ntripled in number and the goalie\nhad actually played in goal before!\nA hard game followed with\nfurious attacking football from\nboth sides. Without Neil Price to\nmoan at, second-team ers Chris\nBeer and Phil Niccolls found it\nhard to adjust to playing in this all-action outfit. They must however\nbe given special credit for lasting\nthe full 90 minutes, in a class of\nfootball to which they are\nunaccustomed. U.C. took an early\nlead, when our keeper, from Aero\nII, miscalculated the Mach\nnumber and projected elevation\nof a hopeful long shot. Alan\nDonaldson equalise d with a beautifully worked goal, and Dave\nMcPhail got the winner in the\ndying seconds.\nAt full time, U.C. were still\ncounting the number of players\nwe had, and regretting they had\nunderestimated Dave Hall's tactical genius.\nTeam: - Al Betts, Cyril Knowles,\nChris Beer, Giles Brereton, Dave\nHall, Adrian Clarke, Phil Niccolis.\nAlan Donaldson, Graeme\nRickard, Dave McPhail, Ian\nStevenson.\nThe Kensington Cruncher\nO 'KELLY SUBSTITUTION\nSPARKS SUPERFIFTH'SI.C. VTH 8:0 BIRKBECK III\nWhen the ageing and rapidly tiring Paddy O 'Kelly was taken\noff at half-time and replaced by Stu Dillon the Fifth's came\ndramatically to life.\nUp to half-time the Fifth's had looked surprisingly subdued\nand had only two goals to show for all their efforts. These both\ncame from headers following Paddy O 'Kelly crosses: the first\nbeing a fine bullet header from 'Big Headed' Barrie Hatton, and\nthe second yet another 'vital' goal from Phil Lakin.\nIn the second half IC took\ncomplete control of the game\nand Damion Kelly and Denis\nCook were particularly outstanding, dominating the\nmidfield and running off the\nball and supporting colleagues regularly. In defence I.C. never looked in any trouble\nwith Phil Lakin and Al 'Betjemin' Cable dealing admirably with a very 'speedy'\nand skilful Birkbeck centre-forward. Both I.C. full backs\nSteve Kaye and Bob Dhillon\nwere so starved of opposition\nthat they spent practically the\nwhole of the half overlapping-ing in the Birkbeck half. This\nconsiderably helped John Shuttleworth and Stu Dillon\nI.C.'s two wingers who were\nconsistently beating the\nBirk beck fullbacks and aiming a succession of\ncrosses at Barrie Hatton's head. This proved to be such a large target that they rarely\nmissed. In fact this proved so\nsuccessful that several times\n(5) the ball actually bounced\nof Barrie's head into the net.\nThough it is worth noting that\nthe one time Stu Dillon missed\nthe target he scored.\nIt must be pointed out\nhowever that Birkbeck were\nsuch a poor side that not only\ndid Steve 'Dracula' Veats have\nnothing to do ( and thereby\nkeep a clean sheet) but also\nClive Whiteside was at times\nmade to look like a football ar. Team: S. Veats, B. Dhillon, S. Kaye, A I, Cable (Capt), P. Lakin, D. Kelly. D. Cook, C. Whiteside, S. Dillon, J. Shuttleworth. B. Hatton.\n[ FOOTBALL FOURTHS IN LATE TITLE BID\nUC IV I,I. C. IV 7\nWith a sudden, if unexpected, return to form the IVth's continued their astonishing run-in to possible league honours\nwith a crushing 7-1 victory away to U.C. Although informed\nsources fear they may have left it too late, the confidence in the\ncamp is sky-high and with three crucial games remaining, it\ntakes a brave man to bet against them.\nFresh from their record breaking 24-0 win against Q.E. C., I.C. were\neager and hungry to avenge a defect earl fer in the season by U.C. and\nwith the hot spring sunshine on their backs, set about the task in earnest.\nBeing a midweek match meant there were less hangovers than usual\nand this was soon made evident by the fact that over half their passes\nactually found another I.C. player, with debut starlet Millar finding\nO' Kelly( not an easy task) with a series of good balls down the left Hank.\nAlthough U.C. battled gamely, unchallenged through the home\nincessant I.C. pressure had to tell\nand when the first goal came, it\nwas stunning in its implicit)'.\nMartyn pounced on a loose ball in\nmid fi eid and slipped it to Millar who again sent O' Kelly away\ndown the left; a hard cross found\nRowley on the spot, and\" Der Bomber\" made no mistake from\nten yards.\nAt this stage U.C. made a brief\nattempt to get back in the game\nbut Wilson easily dealt with their\none player of any skill, and as\nnormal Caffyn, Smith, and the\ngeneral, Lakin were more than a match for anyone else who came\nthrough. I.C. soon regained\ncontrol and good work by Rake\non the right set up the second goal\nwhen, after beating two men he\nput Martyn through, who then\nleft Rowley with a formality.\nNow U.C. heads began to drop\nand this was the signal for I.C. to\nstep up the pace even more, as\nthey displayed the ruthless, killer-instinct which is now such a feature of their game. Large and\nlooming gaps were opening up\neverywhere in the U.C. defence\nand a good run by Shuttleworth\ndown the right provided Rowley\nwith a chance to entertain\neveryone with a ten second ball\njuggling act before being able to\ncontrol the ball and slot it past a bemused, applauding 'keeper, for\nhis hat-trick.\nThis was shortly followed by\nmore dazzling footwork by\nO' Kelly on the left, who, when he\nactually received the ball, split\nthe defence to give Martyn a simple tap in. More Irish wizardry saw him personally\nscore a few minutes later, and in\nthe dying seconds Rowley,\nobviously bored as he walked\ndefence, played a one-two with\nthe left-hand post before lashing\nin his fourth.\nAt the hall-time change round,\nO' Kelly didn't and thus played\nthe second hall on the right,\nalthough he says it was a move to\nconfuse their defence. In fact the\nsecond half was very much an anti-climax, with I.C.'s approach\nbecoming very lethargic. This\nwasn't aided much by the fact\nthat on the odd occasion they did\nproduce something positive, there\nwere so many IVth's forwards in\nthe box anxious to cash in on the\ngoal bonanza that invariably they\nblocked each others' shots.\nThis rather wasteful play had\nits inevitable result when the\ndefence, well up to bolster the\nflagging attack, were caught a bit\nby one of the isolated U.C. breaks\nwhich ended when one of their\nrelatively obscure players, \" nutmeg ged\" three of ours, including\nWitts in goal (who otherwise had\na magnificent mat cf O for a token\nreply.\nI.C. were rocked, but soon\nregained some composure and a bit more urgency was rewarded\nwhen Rowley hit his fifth from a corner, after Shuttleworth had gone close, to once more regain as a ler. six goal breathing space. In\nfact in the last lew minutes I.C. raised their game considerably\nand could have had a couple more\nbut the second half was best\nepitomized by the last incident of\nthe game, when O' Kelly found\nhimself clear and trying to\nemulate Rowley played the ball\noff the post again - only this time it\nbounced off for a goal kick.\nTeam: Witts, Wilson, Lakin.

Personally I was\ndelighted and disgusted respectively.\nRefectories\nNot only has Professor Eilon seen fit to set the wage element of the regulator at\n1%, by claiming in was \"executive action\" and thereby preventing Refectory\nCommittee from voting on it, but it now appears that this system has been applied\nBACKDATED TO JANUARY contributing towards the 4% price rise in the\nrefectories which occurred YESTERDAY.\nSuch blatant disregard for the attitudes of students at IC is incredible! After one\namendment, the recommendation by ICU President Mary Attenborough was to;\n) Hold a total boycott of all refectories this Thursday,\ni) Hold a continuous total boycott commencing next term,\nii) Withdraw student support from the \"Meet Imperial College\" scheme, if the\nExec, feel it is warranted.\nCollege in general, and Professor Eilon and Captain Lindley in particular,\nobviously think we are going to accept the ridiculous new regulator and the\nunacceptable resulting price rises. Presumably, since they have ignored our token\none-day boycott, they feel we cannot organise a continuous boycott of all\nrefectory outlets. We must show them that we can. Unless EVERYBODY can find\nalternatives to eating in the refectories next term the current situation, where two\nor three people can arbitrarily increase the price of our meals, will continue.\nSUPPORT THE BOYCOTT ON THURSDAY!\nSUPPORT THE BOYCOTT NEXT TERM!\nRecruitment\nThe motion on Job Recruitment which caused so much controversy at the last\nUGM (Hustings) was finally passed yesterday. I felt that the motion, as well as\ntacitly supporting Apartheid, contained several unnecessary phrases such as\n\"propagating particular political bandwagons\". Surely the right of individuals to\nchoose where they work could have been preserved without painting the picture\nof a political Union battling against the Careers Advisory Service. I think Andy\nLewis should not have prevented the second amendment from being heard in the\nway that he did, although with that many miners at the meeting they could have\ndone just about anything.\nThe only two good points that came out of the affair were that;\ni) The motion didn't explicitly support South Africa or its system,\nii) A Union meeting can be kept quo rate for serious issues.\nUniversity Challenge\nOn a slightly lighter note, the team representing us in University Challenge has\nnow been chosen. It consists of; Andrew Gray (Biochem. PG), Bob Hart (Aero. 3),\nDamion Hassan (Maths 1) and Frank James (HOST PG). The reserve is Nick\nGriffin (Chem Eng 2). Congratulations to those five and commiserations to the\nrest who entered: it was a very hard test. I know Pete Davies (ACC Chairprimate)\nwants a mention as he was the only person to know \"Peracles\".\nFELIX\nPapers for ne\"xt year's committee are now up in the FELIX Office. Membership\nfor next year will probably be 50 p but anyone who joins now will only have to pay\n30 p for next year. If you wish to join FELIX, or stand for a committee post, come\nalong and see me in the FELIX Office. Membership until the end of this session is\nfree!\nPersonal Column\nMy apologies to Mr. Raouf Zaidan for mi spelling his name last week in the\nletters' page. Whilst on the subject of apologies, I know Malcolm Brain wants to\napologise for his language at yesterday's UGM but feels that there was intense\nprovocation.\nFinally I would like to thank Sheyne for all his help during my time as Editor. He\nhas been an extremely good friend, not only to myself but to many others as well. I know we will miss him very much and I'd like to wish him every success in the\nfuture. Cheers,\nJohn.\n- con td. from Page 2\nrepresented what must have\nseemed to her to have been the\nonly possible action left to stop the\nmotion from being passed.\nAn estimated 200 students were\npresent when the meeting was\nterminated; a number considerably in excess of some past\nmeetings. The time at which the\nquorum was challenged cannot\nbe used as an excuse either as it\nwas obvious, even to the less\nenthusiastic about the motion,\nthat a vote was imminent.\nI personally no longer have any\nconfidence in a Union President\nwho can call quorum at his/her\nown Union General Meeting. I would therefore like to see a truthful explanation for Mary's performance though I feel that no\nexcuse can be acceptable.\nYours respectfully,\nAndy Lewis\nR SMU President\nICU Vice President\nDear Sir, - Recent events show\nthat I.C.U. President is blatantly\nout of touch with grassroots\nopinion. She supported the\ncon travers i al motion on Northern\nIreland which was overwhelmingly rejected. She is also bitterly\nopposed to a current proposal to\nreform Union policy on job recruitment.\nThis proposal has the active\nsupport of all the C. C.U. Presidents and was debated for\nthree-quarters of an hour at the\nlast U.G. M.At this meeting two\namendments (one proposed by\nMiss Attenborough) were convincingly rejected. Mark Corrigan\nhad just finished his summing up\nspeech when Miss Attenborough\ncalled 'quorum'.\nWhat were her motives? She\nhas been happy to see her own pet\nmotions passed at in quo rate Union meeting with only minutes\nleft. At the last U. G.M. the new\npolicy was about to be put to the\nvote with five minutes remaining.\nThe excuse that 'quorum' was\ncalled because people had to go to\nlectures is clearly incompatible\nwith these facts.\nWhile Miss Attenborough was\nputting forward her amendment\na student decided to propose that\n'She be not heard\". At this stage\nMiss Attenborough 'threatened'\nto call 'quorum'. Such a threat is\nexcusable if made in jest, but an\nabuse of the concept of quorum when used in political wheeler-dealing. It is clear that Miss\nAttenborough called quorum because she disagreed with the\nmotion about to be passed. Her action was entirely selfish.\nDuring the meeting she said\nthat she would be ashamed to\nbelong to the Union if such a policy were passed. It is apparent\nthat the political ideas of Miss\nAttenborough are her prime\nconsideration and that she has\nshown herself able to disregard\nthe feelings and opinions of her\nmembers.\nHence she is rapidly losing\ntouch with these members and\nought to consider carefully the\nimplications of this conclusion.\nYours sincerely,\nMark Clegg\nMe ch. Eng. 1\nTo Whom It May Concern,Whilst always recognising that we\nare constantly heading towards\nmaximum entropy I feel that on\nlast Sunday (11th)I received\nmore than my fair share.\nTo return at 11.30 after a hard\nnight's day and find that my room\nhas been broken into and\nsubjected to quirky acts of\nvandalism is. in itself, unpleasant.\nCombined with the theft of mv\nMan as Club tie. and various\nother acts v which I have assumed\nto be a personal attack, it was a traumatic end to a long day.\nI would therefore like to\nchallenge the per port at or( s^ ol\nthis deed to a dual in Princes\nG dns. at dawn. Failing satisfaction an apology and ,\u00a32.50\nfor a new tie will do.\nChris Fox\nSelkirk 572\nDear John, I would like to express my\nconcern about one aspect of the\nrecent sabbatical election campaigns. I was surprised to see\nthe current ICU President\nactively supporting one of the\npresidential election candidates\nby canvassing on his behalf. (This\nnot only took the form of extolling\nthe virtues of her 'protege', but\nalso of making some remarks\nabout his opponent which have\nbeen described as 'somewhat\nslanderous').\nReference to the ICU Blueboqk\n.assured me that there is no\nimpediment to any incumbent of\nsa Union post supporting, or even\nproposing a particular candidate\nfor his/her own job. It does,\nhowever, seem rather unethical.\nSurely, if more widespread, this\npractice could lead to a situation\nwhere the mantle of office would\nbe handed down to the favorite\nson and the ruling dynasty-continued.\nIn an 'immature and apolitical\nunion' like C& GU no executive\nmember may propose or second\nan v candidate. It is also an\nunwritten rule, perhaps because\nof our inherent democratic\ninstincts, thar the students of City\nand Guilds choose the executive\nthat they want unhindered by the\nopinions (however strongly they\nmax be held) ol the current union\nofficers.\nShould Ms. Attenborough's support not prose counter productive and her favoured\ncandidate be elected. I only hope\nthat he continues to implement\nher election promises of 1978 and that 'Democracy in Action' continues to thrive at Imperial\nCollege. Yours sincerely,\nSimon Lea Dear Sir, - May I take this\nopportunity to offer my deepest\napologies to Jan Czernuszka from\nwhose name I erroneously om mite da'z', but I never could\nspell Irish names.\nHowever, I was rather puzzled\nby his statement in a letter to last\nweek's FELIX which suggested\nthat the Mourning er I mean\nthe ' Morning Cloud' editor \"could\nspend his and his reader's' time on more\nworthwhile topics.\" Surely was it\nnot he that consumed a j considerable amount of U.G.

C.D.C. at\nCambridge\nThis year, on 17th February, saw the first Southern Universities'\nAnnual (hopefully) Ball, hosted by Cambridge University Dancing Club\nand held near Cambridge in a very pleasant Civic Hall at St. Ives. I.C. Dancing Club and five other university clubs attended the event,\nincluding Oxford, Exeter and Southampton, I. C.D.C. provided more\nthan a full team of competitors and a large crowd of supporters all of\nwhom enjoyed a most successful evening of dancing and\nentertainment.\nThere has been a growing interest in the need for a Southern\nUniversities' Ball in order to complement the Northern Universities' Ball,\nheld exclusively for clubs north of Birmingham each year. It has always\nbeen held a few weeks before the Inter-Varsity Dancing Competition\nand has provided a valuable'warm-up' event for the northern clubs and\na chance for them to eye up some of the opposition before the national\ncompetition - an opportunity much missed by the southern universities.\nCambridge finally took the initiative and announced their plans to hold\nthe first Southern Universities' Ball this last February.\nThe main object of the evening was to provide plenty of dancing and\nentertainment for everybody to enjoy. The organisers fulfilled this\nintention admirably and a large part of the evening was devoted to\ngeneral dancing, including Gay Gordens, Barn dances, etc., which\nheightened the atmosphere of the event. Jan and Bernard Reilly, world\nprofessional exhibition champions, gave a demonstration which,\nalthough skilfully performed and well presented, lost a little of the\ncharacter of one or two latin dances and lacked a certain sparkle one\nmight expect from international champions. Oxford and Cambridge\neach provided a few minutes' amusement in the form of offbeat\nsketches. Cambridge 'took the micky' out of Saturday Night Fever\ndancing by acting out a game of cricket in time to music by the Bee Gees\nusing 'fever' dance steps. Oxford also included some 'fever' steps and\nsome clever jive steps in their version of 'West Side Story'. This included\nsome very imaginative choreography and excellent team dancing by\nover thirty people, resulting in Oxford being judged the better offbeat\nteam by a very small margin.\nThe main team competition consisted of two rounds of waltz,\nquickstep, cha-cha and jive for which each university could enter one or\ntwo couples per dance. There was a total of ten couples for each dance.\nCambridge dominated the competition with their first and second\nteams, but I.C. made a good attempt to establish themselves as strong\nopposition to Cambridge. Rosalind Baker and Andy Hall (waltz) came\n4th, Sally Barton and John Molero (quickstep) came 4th, Sue Walker\nand Stan Julien (cha-cha) came 5th and Sarah Melley and Mark Slater\n(jive) came 2nd in their respective dances placing the team third overall.\nSue Smart and James Newton (jive), the only representatives of our\nsecond team, were unfortunately eliminated after the first round.\nMarion Hill, Vincent Tarn's( cha-cha) partner, injured her knee shortly\nbefore the Ball and so they were, sadly, unable to represent the first\nteam in the competition. The club's other notable success was in the\nindividual novice waltz competition in which Colin Lewis, despite\nloosing his partner at the last moment due to illness, danced with Laura\nPymont and, to everyone's delight, came second out of well over twenty\ncouples.\nMEATHEAD\nTAKES\nA PHEW!\nI. C.D.C. at Home\nA great dancer once said \"It Is better to be able to, and not want to, than want to and not be able to\". This is true of most activities of man, so if you\nwant to be one of those who is able to and also a cut above the other 'socialites', you could begin by reading about the activities of one ofthe largest\nand most active clubs at Imperial College.\nThere are various reasons for the great interest shown in what might appear to bean out-of-date hobby. Firstly, of course, there are those who\nsimply want to dance, either because they enjoy it, or because they regard it as a necessary social grace (or in the case of some of the men, more an\nasset than a grace!). Some come to meet girls (I?) or to make friends in general. Some come out of curiosity, or because they enjoy music, and\nothers come for the shear hell of it. Whatever the reasons for coming, however, all our members appear to enjoy themselves.\nBesides the basic ballroom and Latin-American dances which are taught first (namely, social Foxtrot, Waltz, Quickstep and ChaCh aCha, Jive,\nRumba) a fair number of \"party\" dances are taught: Gay Gordons, D.W. S., Bossa Nova, the Trombone Dance etc. Dances such as the slow Foxtrot,\nTango, Samba and Paso Doble are far more difficult to master and are not usually introduced at beginners' level. In addition to these, one or two\ndances from \"Grease\" and \"Saturday Night Fever\" have been introduced this year such as the Hand-Jive, but the interest for this type of Disco'\ndancing is limited.\nOf course, once the dances have been learnt, the idea is to practise them, and the club provides ample opportunity for this. The class lesson is\nfrom 7.30 - 9.00, and from 9.00 to 10.00 each evening music is played for \"general\" dancing.\nIt is all very well learning to dance but many of our members want the chance to practise the steps in a 'real' atmosphere. The Christmas Dinner\nand dance, where a live band provides the music, gives ample opportunity for this. For similar reasons, visits to Kensington Town Hall, The Cafe de\nParis in Leicester Square, and Hammersmith Palais are arranged at reduced rates. There are also other \"dancing evenings\" during the year when\nthe dancing is complemented by refreshments both liquid and solid.\nThe dancing classes are taken by Christine and Bernadette on 3 nights a week (Mon., Tues., Wed.). Christine teaches dancing full-time and has\nbeen coming to IC for 15 years. Bernadette works in a travel agency during the day, but spares an evening a week to guide confused feet around the\nfloor. Before the main classes begin at 7.30, Christine and Bernadette take medal classes - bronze, silver and gold in ballroom and Latin-American\ndances. These classes vary from 4 to 16 people and have a high exam pass success rate. Last Sunday, for example, saw about 25 members all\npassing their medal exams in the J. C.R., many with honours and commendations.\nDancing Club, therefore, not only offers the opportunity to learn to dance and practise but also an active social life.

III.\nHill and Vincent Tam in the Cha-Cha-Cha The team making their entrance at Lancaster\nI. C.D.C. at\nLancaster\nOn Friday 9th March, 47 members of Imperial College Dancing Club\nboarded a coach destined for The University of Lancaster. The Prospect\nof a5 hour journey was hardly inviting, but much of the times was spent\nplaying intelligent games such as bridge, l spy and animal snap.\nAfter a short visit to the city of Lancaster (Royalty Rules O.K.), we\narrived at the University campus and prepared ourselves for the 'big\nevent' of the* student dancers' year, namely, the Intervarsity Dancing\nAssociation (I.V. D.A.) Ball and Competitions.\nThere were 18 University teams from all parts of the country\ncompeting in the four dance team competitions, six clubs also entering\nthe off-beat competition.\nAfter some general dancing, the competitive events started, with Ros\nBaker and Andy Hall giving a good display of waltz. This was followed\nby Sally Barton and John Molero com pet ant ly representing I.C. at the\nquickstep. Our two Latin American couples were not to be out-done\nhowever, and Marion Hill dancing with Vincent Tam provided a lively\ncha-cha. Our biggest hope fulls, Sarah Melley & Mark Slater, were I.C.'s last couple to dance the first round, and they stepped confidently on to\nthe floor (after their second place at the Southern Ball) to display their\nobvious talent for the jive.\nOver the next couple of hours, the competitors had to sweat it out as\ncouples were eliminated following each round. Each couple from\nImperial reached the final, which was an admirable feat in itself.\nRosalind and Andy came 7th in the waltz, Sally and John did\nexceptionally well, coming 4th in the quickstep, and Marion and Vincent\nwere pleased to come 6th in the cha-cha, despite the fact that Marion\nwas in the Health Centre a week previously with a serious knee injury.\nFinally, the club would like to congratulate Sarah and Mark for\nachieving second place in the jive - an excellent performance. These\nresults placed the Imperial College team third overall, only to be beaten\ninto first and second places by Cambridge and Liverpool respectively.\nAfter the finals, the off-beat competition was held. This is a competition designed so that club members, not involved with the team,\ncould still compete by giving a small 5 minute show, the prize going to\nthe most original and, above all, most entertaining entry. In a close\nbattle with Oxford's \"West Side Story\", the I.C. team's\" A Dancing Menu\" came out top. A marvellous achievement by all members, especially to\nColin Lewis who was the team choreographer. This is the first time the\nclub has won this event.\nA demonstration in Ballroom Dancing was given by Ian and Christine\nStephenson (Scottish Professional Modern Champions). This gave our\nmembers an opportunity to \"see how it really should be done\".\nAll in all, a most successful and enjoyable evening to all concerned.\nThe Journey Home compared well to the celebrations of the Welsh XV\nwinning The Triple Crown, and the goings on on the coach made\nMarjorie Proop's Gossip Column read like the Noddy Album 1977.\nThose involved:\nRos Baker Mark Slater\nAndy Hall Sue Smart\nSally Barton James Newton\nJohn Malero Marian Hill\nSue Walker Vincent Tam\nStan Julien Colin Lewis\nSarah Melley Laura Pymont\nSarah Melley and Mark Slater Ros Baker and Andy Hall in the Waltz\nThe committee and team of I. C.D.C. would like to thank all the members of the Club for the support they have given this year.\n\n"
