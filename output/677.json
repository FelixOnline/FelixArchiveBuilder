Like all such places it\nhas its problems but. in general,\nthe flats represent a high\nstandard of spacious accommodation\u2014in contrast to that\ngenerally available for second\n/third years and PGs.\nMichael Arthur feels that the\nrent levels are too high and is\n(quite rightly) concerned with\nthe loss of income during the\nSummer Vacation. Equally, it\nshould be pointed out that no\nloss is made during the nine\nmonths of term time. The losses\nin question were \u00a34.000 the first\nSummer, when r|s flats were\nleft virtually empty, and\nfurther \u00a3 1,800 last Summer as a result of Student Service's haphazard method of assigning\nSummer accommodation places. This has resulted in an\nelement of \u00a32.50 per week being\nincluded in our rent levels to\ncover the anticipated loss for\nthis summer. Despite this our\nrents are \u2022ii rect ly comparable to\ntho-e in other Head Tenancies\nfor what is, after all, higher\nstandard of accommodation.\nIn contrast. Hamlet Gardens\n'Summer Letting Scheme' made\na profit of \u00a3245.000 last year by\nadvertising on the open market.\nSo successful is the scheme that\nthis year it has been expanded\nto include Lexham Gardens for\nthe first time: however. Sinclair\nGardens is regarded as too\nsmall a unit to participate.\nI have been told that our lease\nwill only be renegotiated if I can\npersonally guarantee that there\nwill be no vacant places not this\nsummer but that of 1985! Since\ninclusion under the Summer\nLetting Scheme has been\ndeemed unsuitable, I have\nsuggested advertising to\nstudents in either London, or\nanother university, or letting to\nthe general public via a legal\nholiday-let lease. This could\nmost easily be accomplished\nby letting Sinclair Gardens as\n'family flats' over the entire\nthree month period\u2014thus\navoiding administrative hassle.\nI am perfectly prepared to do\nall I can to help Student\nServices, but their rejection of\nmy suggestions leaves me in the\nimpossible position of being\nresponsible for filling the flats\nbut with no obvious way of\nachieving this.\nIn the last few years Student\nServices have done well in\nobtaining a large amount of\naccommodation suitable for\nfirst year undergraduates in\norder to attract them to the\nCollege. However, it seems a great pity that a first, badly\nneeded, step in improving the\nstandard of accommodation for\nsecond/third years and PGs\n(who do. after all, constitute\n75% of the student body)\nshould be abandoned and 26\nmore students condemned to\nbed sitter land.\nCaroline Low\nStudent Manager\nSinclair Gardens\nFCS\nShit-stirrers\nincidents occur ing at NUS conferences. Jonathan's letter\nprovides no evidence to show\nthat the NUS did not act\nimpartially in the handling of\nthis year's Easter conference. I suspect that far more students\nwould respect Jonathan's stance against NUS if he was to\nback it up with reasonable\narguments (of which there is\ncertainly no shortage) instead\nof with provocative rhetoric, no\nmatter how tongue in cheek this\nmay be.\nIt would be dangerous for\nImperial College Union to\nincite the student unions of\nother colleges into d is affiliating from NUS. We owe it to our\nfellow students elsewhere to\nprovide them with an impartial\nview of the consequences of\nd is a ff il ation so that they can\nmake up their own minds\nbefore taking such an\nimportant decision. Furthermore, IC Union has policy\nstating that it is a non party\npolitical body. I have no\nintention of going against this\npolicy and pursuing a blatantly\nparty political course of action\nof the whim of Jonathan and a small minority of students at\nIC.\nYours sincerely\nPeter Burt\nPS: Lest your readers suspect\nthat the there may be a trace of\nanimosity between Jonathan\nand myself, may I hasten to\nassure them that we are, in fact,\ngood friends.\nDear Pallab\nAt the risk of prolonging a somewhat tedious exchange of\nviews. I shall briefly reply to last\nweek's letter form Jonathan\nGerson.\nIt is quite proper that there\nshould be debate within student\nunions about the merits or\notherwise of affiliation to the\nNational Union of Students.\nThe Federation of Conservative\nStudents have chosen to\nespouse the case against NUS membership, but it appears that\nthey have adopted the tactics of\nsensationalism in their campaign by making a series of\nunproven allegations about\nAccident\nnot forgotten\nDear Pallab\nFollowing the publication of\nGiovanni Vacago's observations on RCC's safety policy\nlast week, I feel obliged to\nexplain a few points in rather\nmore detail.\nFirstly, whilst as far as the\nclub were concerned the\naccident of Christmas 1981 had\nbeen forgotten, College had not\nPage 21\n\u2022Friday, June 8, 19841\ndismissed the matter so quickly\nand were, when the Safety\nPolicy documents were\nsubmitted, on the point of\ncontacting the Union regarding\nclub safety. College was\nespecially concerned about the\nfate of a document produced in\nJune 1982 laying down various\nrules in a code of safety\npractice. Whilst well intention ed, the proposals were\nimpracticable and unwieldy\nprincipally because the widely\ndiffering interests of the clubs\nconcerned had not been taken\ninto account.\nIt was because RC C had this\nunimplemented document\nhanging over it that in\nNovember last year I took steps\nto produce a more workable\nscheme.\n< At a meeting of the clubs\nconcerned, it was decided by\nconsensus to draw up\nindividual safety policy documents featuring:\n1. A formal agreement to\nmaintain a log book of the\nnames of participating club\nmembers along with names,\ncontact address and, ideally,\ntelephone numbers of next of\nkin and to take this log on all\noutings. This log would be left\nin a readily accessible place in\norder that notification of\npersons missing or dead could\nquickly be passed to the\nrelatives.\n2. Further safety standards\nwhich the club in question\nmight wish to adopt.\nThus it is the clubs themselves who decide just how\nmuch individual freedom will\nbe curtailed and not, as might\nbe construed from Mr Vacago's article, the RC C Exec.\nThe log book was felt to be\nnecessary because in the\nChristmas 81 accident there was\nconsiderable delay in next of\nkin being informed since no one\nknew the dead student's surname \u2014 obviously an unacceptable state of affairs.\nFinally if, as Giovanni puts it\n\"another accident came to\nshake our consciences\" I would\nmost certainly hope that the\nnature of, and the events\nleading up to, the accident\nwould be scrutinised to see if anything could be learnt rather\nthan dismissing the idea of\nfurther 'restrictions' out of\nhand.\nYours sincerely\nHugh Stiles\nRC C Chairman\nYours sincerely\nHugh Stiles, RCC Chairman\nSteve Lane, IC Caving Club\nPresident and RCC Ass Hon Sec\n\u2022 H HM HH HMM H1 FELIX\n\n"

If it\nsucceeds it will allow students to make a more informed choice as to which\npostgraduate courses or research to undertake and to get a flavour of what\nlife as a postgraduate is like. Comments about the content of the handbook\nfrom staff, students and anyone interested in postgraduate study should be\nsent to Hugh Stiles, c/o the Union Office. There is an open meeting about the\nhandbook on Tuesday at 1:00pm in the Union Upper Lounge for anyone\ninterested.\nFELIX Motor Rally\nThe fabulous FELIX Motor Rally will be held on Sunday 24 of June so keep\nthat date free in your diaries. The FELIX rally is a treasure hunt and involves\ncareering around London collecting various items from a list, for which\npoints are awarded. The only requirements are a vehicle, a crew (four\nmaximum) and plenty of cunning. A good time is usually had by all and the\nwinners have their names inscribed on the FELIX rally pot in the Union Bar.\nEntry forms can be picked up in the FELIX Office from Monday.\nLast Issue\nThere won't be a FELIX next week, the final issue will be a fun packed\nbumper edition on Wednesday 20 June. This will contain all those things we\ndared not print earlier this year, so don't all rush home till you've read it!\nKeep sending in letters, small ads, etc, copy deadline is 1:00pm Tuesday. Help\nand ideas for the last issue will be welcome, especially needed are people to\nhelp collate on Tuesday evening.\nA Memory That Lasts A Life Time\nJust a reminder that you can have your copies of FELIX bound in beautiful\nblack leather, tastefully embossed in gold. Just bring your copies of FELIX into the FELIX Office before the end of term.

All Primelia\nCollege students, of course, are wonderful, honest\npeople and always tell the truth. All Queen's College\nstudents, on the other hand, are nasty, despicable\nsorts and always lie.\nI found three people sitting at a table, and asked\nthe first one \"Are you from PrimeliaorQueens?\"His\nanswer was slurred and unintelligible so I asked him\nagain 'Are you from Primelia or Queens?\" This time,\nthe second one said \"He said he was from Primelia,\nand he is, and so am I.\" The third person then said\n\"The two people you asked are from Queen's and I am from Primelia.\"\nFrom what they said, which College does each\nbelong to?\nGood luck everyone.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. \u00a35\ncheque, courtesy of Mend-a Bike for the randomly\nselected winner.\nLast week's solution\nWhoops! Having written a puzzle to advertise the\ndate of the FELIX Car Rally and made it pretty easy, I made it easier than I thought because there were two\nsolutions:\n'20 June, meet FELIX Office, 10:30am, maximum\nof five in a team, car not needed' AND'24 June, meet FELIX Office, 10:30am, maximum\nof four in a team, car not needed.'\nThe answer was meant to be the second one. The\nFELIX Car Rally will take place on Sunday 24 June,\nstarting at 10:30am at the FELIX Office, with a maximum of four in a team; you will need a car as\nPallab and I will send you off around London to\ncollect various information and treasure. If you're\ninterested, please give your names in to the FELIX\nOffice soon.\nThe randomly selected winner was WG Morley of\nChemistry 1, who can collect the \u00a3 5 cheque,\ncourtesy of Mend-a Bike, from the FELIX Office\nafter 1:30pm on Monday.\nMEND A BIKE\nSub-Wardenships and Assistant SubWardenships, Tizard and Selkirk Halls\nApplications are invited for two posts of sub-warden and two of\nassistant sub-warden effective from September 1984.

As\nMr Mooney begins his final year in\noffice, FELIX reporter Hugh Southey\nhas been behind the scenes in the\nrefectory system to find out what\nreally goes on.\nFeature\nbeans on the torrid and steamy events in the\nREFECTORY(LR) Victor Mooney, Refectory Manager\u2014leads from the\nfront, Martin Parsons, Deputy Refectory\nManager\u2014incompetent. Hugh Southey, Reporter\u2014\ngullible.\nThe day can begin as early as 6:30am for\nsome refectory staff. Twice a week, on\nTuesdays and Thursdays, there is a pilgrimage to London's Covent Garden\nmarket where Mr Mooney buys salad\nvegetables and fruit. Most of the other food\nsuch as vegetables and meat is delivered to\nCollege by wholesalers; students get through\n\u00a35.000 worth of food every week!\nBy 8:00am the full time cooks have arrived\nin the Sherfield Building. They start work\nimmediately, preparing for the day's meals.\nAt 9:00am they have breakfast\u2014but this is\nthe last break that they are likely to have until\n2:30 or 3:00pm. After breakfast, begins the long slog\npreparing lunch. For the next five hours the\ncooks will be working non-stop chopping\nvegetables, preparing the food and lifting\nheavy pots and pans full of food. And all this\ngoes on in an increasingly hot and sweaty\natmosphere.\nIn the past, the refectory has been accused\nof being un hygienic. FELIX has regularly\nreported cockroaches in College kitchens.\nHowever my experience was that the staff\nfollow the health acts scrupulously. Work\nsurfaces are cleaned at least twice a day, no\none is allowed to smoke and store rooms are\ncleaned once a day. Anyone who disobeys\nthis is likely to lose their job.\nAt 2:30pm after the last students have had\ntheir meal, the refectory staff have to clean\nthe kitchens before they have their lunch.\nThe hour's break seems short after five hours\nsolid work.\nAfter lunch the staff come back to work for\nanother one and a half hours, preparing food\nfor the next day. Often, though, there maybe\na formal dinner in the evening in which case\nthe cooks can expect to work until 8:00 or\n9:00pm. As well as the Sherfield kitchens there is\nanother large kitchen in Southside. Most of\nSouthside food consists of food cooked in\nSherfield which is then frozen and\ntransported to Southside. The staff in\nSouthside have less work to do than those in\nSherfield since they only have to re-heat the\nfood.\nThe food in Southside may sometimes not\nbe as well cooked as that in Sherfield when\nthe frozen meals have not been heated\nproperly.\nThe work that Mr Mooney's kitchen staff\nput in is impressive. The raw materials\nbought in are of the highest quality; the coo <s put in many hours hard slog, working harder\nPreparations for a formal dinner in Southside.\nPage 6 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ^ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 M HB than most industrial workers. What, then, is\nthe reason for the sometimes poor quality of\nthe finished product?\nThe food that leaves the kitchens is not ideal.\nThis is because the number of staff in the\nkitchens means that, by their own admission,\nthey can not always put on the finishing\ntouches that can make the difference\nbetween an average meal and a really good\nmeal.\nThis problem is compounded by the fact\nthat at the same time that most members of\nstaff are working on the lunches for students,\nsome will be preparing food for formal\ndinners, and some for 170 Queensgate, the\nRector's residence. The money made from\nformal meals sub sid is e students' refectory\nmeals.\nAnother major problem is the way that the\nfood is served, and the way that it is stored\nbefore serving. Many of the serving staff are\nfriendly\u2014however some are downright rude\nand seem to have no idea of how to make\nfood look attractive on a plate.\nAs in most catering operations, there is a high turnover of serving staff in the refectory,\nwhich makes it difficult for Mr Mooney to\norganise a proper training scheme. In the\npast, the staff selection procedure has been\npoor (resulting in many of his staff coming\nfrom one family in Fulham!). However in\nrecent years Mr Mooney has made a positive\nmove in improving selection procedures.\nMany of his younger members of staff are on\nday release catering and management\ncourses and are of a very high standard.\nMr Mooney is generally agreed by his staff\nto be a very good refectory manager. They\nrespect him because of his willingness to 'lead\nfrom the front'. He quite often rolls up his\nsleeves and mucks in with his staff. Many of\nhis staff would not consider working for\nanyone else. His major shortcoming is in his\nfinancial administration of the refectories.\nThere is a feeling within the Union and\nCollege Block that his accounting procedures are un businesslike and still in the\nfinancial stone age.\nMr Mooney has been criticised for refusing\nto take the advice of College's finance\nsection. The reasons are complex, but are\nsaid to originate from the College expansion\nin the sixties and seventies.\nIn the fifties Mr Mooney ran an extremely\npopular refectory. However Imperial College\nexpanded and the system was not able to\ncope with the increased demand. Thequality\nof food suffered and Mr Mooney simply lost\ntrack of the financial workings of the enlarged\nrefectory system.\nTo help re vital is e the refectory system\nCollege brought in Captain Lindley,\ndomestic secretary at the time. However\nthere was a clash of personalities between\nCaptain Lindley and Mr Mooney. To prevent\nCaptain Lindley meddling in the refectories\nMr Mooney fudged and said there was no\nproper financial information to act on. Mr' Mooney is said to have been on the defensive\never since, fending off all suggestions on how\nhe should bring his financial house in order.\nIt was suggested to Mr Mooney that using\nup to date computer stock control methods it\nwould be possible to monitor the cost of\nindividual items of food and price them\naccordingly rather than price them in the\ncurrent 'gu estimate mark-up system'.\nMr Mooney is dragging his heels in\ncomputer ising the refectories. Deputy\nPresident Christine Teller succeeded in\npersuading refectories to adopt a stock\nmonitoring system in the bars resulting in a reduction in the price of a pint. To quote from\nMiss Teller's annual report:\n\"The advantages (in adopting a computerised stock monitoring system) for\nthe refectories as a whole could be immense.\nHowever despite the fact that apparently all\nparties agreed to the value of this element of\ncontrol, the thoroughness with which this\nhas been prevented has lead me to two\nrather un savoury conclusions, either\nCollege is so incompetent that it cannot set\nup one localised financial management/\nstock control system or this project is being\ndeliberately hindered for some reason.\"\nOthers feel that the College did not fully\nsupport the refectories as much as they\nshould. The argument is that College should\nhave provided the necessary back-up when\nthe refectory system expanded, rather than\nexpecting Mr Mooney to cope with a vast and\nsudden increase in the capacity of the\nrefectories.\nOther management staff come in for\na great deal of criticism from kitchen staff.\nThey are felt by the staff to be over-paid and\nincompetent. Martin Parsons, Mr Mooney's deputy, is the target for some of the fiercest\ncriticism. Mr Parsons is said to have lost\n10,000 cigarettes last year and to leave sums\nof money unattended. Many staff have no\nrespect for him at all. They certainly don't want him to take over as refectory manager.\nThe Verdict\nI hope this article has presented a balanced view of the refectory system. Undoubtedly in\nrecent years a great deal of effort and hard work has been put in by Mr Mooney and the\nrefectory staff to improve the food and service in the refectories. The Sherfield Refectory in\nparticular compares favourably to any commercial refectory outlets.\nMr Mooney has faced considerable problems in dealing with the expansion of the\nrefectory system. Other universities facing the same problem reduced their outlets and\nsettled for a skeleton service (most of which lose money).\nMr Mooney has faced a great deal of criticism in the past, often unfair criticism. Irrational,\npersonal attacks on him have resulted only in Mr Mooney closing his ears to any\nconstructive comments or suggestions. Mr Mooney quite firmly believes that he is the\ncatering manager and he knows best.\nAn area in which things could quite definitely be improved is in the financial running of the\nrefectories. There is no reason at all why the College should not have a sensible accounting\nsystem for the refectories.\nMr Mooney retires next year and College will have to consider carefully who replaces\nhim. Mr Mooney's successor must have wide experience of traditional catering methods,\nbecause Mr Mooney does know a lot about this. However they must also be prepared to\nfind out about fast food, something Mr Mooney knows little about. They must be able to\nlead his staff as well as Mr Mooney. However they must be able to take constructive\ncriticism in a way Mr Mooney sometimes seems unable to.\nHugh Southey\nFriday, June 8, 1984\nCooks from the Sherfield Refectory.\nI Page 7\n\n"

    "content": "ACCOMMODATION\nSummer Vacation\nIf you're wondering how to occupy yourself over the next three months\nor you're looking for some remunerative employment in an attempt to\nwipe out this year's overdraft, then staying in London could be the\nanswer to your problems. Many students spend three years in London\nwithout ever really discovering the city and since London abounds\nwith large department stores who regularly seek extra staff during the\nsummer, why not stay in London and combine work and holiday?\nAccommodation is available in IC Halls and Head Tenancies for\nboth staff and students at term time rates throughout the summer.\nAlthough the closing date for applications has officially passed, we do\nstill have a few vacancies, so if you're interested collect an application\nform from Student Services.\nYou may also have some friends or relatives who want to spend\nsome time in London over the summer. Again we offer\naccommodation at cheap rates so why not call into Student Services\nfor further details.\nNext Year\nObviously many of you are now anxious to start the search for\naccommodation for next year. Although October may not seem far\naway to you, unfortunately most private landlords/ladies do not plan\ntheir accommodation this far in advance and therefore Student\nServices don't become informed of the vast majority of\naccommodation until September. We do have a limited amount of\naccommodation for next session on our noticeboards at the moment,\nso if for any reason you can't use September to find accommodation it\nis worth calling into Student Services to see if we can help.\nIf you are able to come down to London in September, this is by far\nthe best time to look. We should be able to accommodate you in an IC\nresidence any time up to 22 September, just give us a ring on 01-589\n5111 ext 2033 a couple of weeks before you come down. After that\nthere should be crash pad accommodation in the Student Union (just\nbring a sleeping bag). In September Student Services should have\ncomprehensive lists of vacancies\u00aband an accommodation guide to give\nyou hints on where to start. You may not discover the home of your\ndreams, but with a little patience, footwork and a lot of 5p pieces you\nshould be able to find something reasonable.\nKaren Stoit\nCollege flats\nfor next\nsession\n(All for groups of four)\n2\n1\n\u00a3145Pw \u00a3115Pw2 SSS^LcA/Zm, ^kk^f from \u00a3 9 3 pw Further details & application forms from\nYour grant 1984/5\nAs most of you are probably aware the undergraduate rates of grant for 1984/5\nwere announced in April. For those of you who missed the original announcement,\nthe figures are reproduced below. Also for those students (and their parents) who\nwant to plan their finances ahead I have included the new scales for parental,\nspouse's and student's own contributions to the grant which should enable you to\nmake an approximate calculation of how much money to expect from yaw local\neducation authority. The basic rates of grant have been increased by 4% but there\nis bad news for those students living on a minimum grant as this has been halved to\n\u00a3210 for the year. The other significant change is the doubling of the travel clement\nin the grant from \u00a350 to \u00a3100 but remember new students will no longer be able to\nclaim any excess travelling monies on top of this and current students will only be\nable to reclaim expenses above \u00a3250.1 have included this year's grant figures as a. comparison.\n1983/4 1984/5\n1975 2100\n1275 1435\n410 205\nSTUDENT SERVICES, 15 PRINCES GDNS\nClosing date Monday, 18 June\nPage 4WM WM MW MWH B BMW MJ MW MW MW KM Friday, June 8, 1984\nMain rates of grant (UG)\nLiving away from home\nLiving at home\nMinimum grant\nThe postgraduate rates of grant have not yet been announced.\nThe Means Test\nl nder graduate grants are means-tested against parental, spouse's and student's own\nincome leaving very few students collecting full grants from their education authorities.\nGrants are means-tested against residual income. Residual income equals gross income for\nthe financial year preceeding the start of the academic year in question, less certain\nallowances which for 1984/5 are:\na) Dependents (other than children or spouse) \u00a3980\nb) Domestic assistance in certain circumstances \u00a3780\nc) Parent who holds a statutory award \u00a3400\nIn respect of each dependent child (other than the student) the following deductions will\nbe made from the asses ed parental contribution: Non-award holders \u00a380; Award holders\n\u00a3225.\n1. Parental Contribution\nThe scale of parental contributions is given below. The 1984/5 scale slightly decreases the\nburden on parents whose incomes are below \u00a311,000, but increases the burden on those\nw ith higher incomes.

Student's Own Income\nAny student who has a term time income of over \u00a3400 (vacation earnings don't count) will\nbe expected to contribute to their own grant. Any additional income above \u00a3400 is\ndeducted \u00a3 1 for \u00a3 I from the grant. However there is an additional disregard of \u00a3580 for\nscholarships or payments from employers and a special disregard of \u00a3850 for National\nEngineering Scholars.\nKaren Siott\nStudent Services\nI FELIX\n\n"

In a clarification of his earlier\nstatements College Secretary John Smith said that this would\nmean both flats being occupied by students next session and one\nthe following session, after which they will both be used by\nacademic staff wardens.\nThere are four flats on the\nSouthside penthouse level which\nwere originally all occupied by\nwardens, one for each of Selkirk,\nTizard, Keogh and Falmouth\nHalls. Two years ago two of these\nwere let to students and the\nnumber of wardens reduced to\ntwo. It has now been decided that\nwhen the present wardens, Dr Paul Jowitt and Dr Henry\nHutchinson, finish their terms of\noffice two wardens will be\nappointed to replace each of\nthem, so reverting to the original\nsituation with four wardens for\nfour halls.\nThis leaves the reason for the\nchange even more obscure than\nbefore. It was thought that\nopposition from the present\nwardens to students occupying\nthe flats was a major reason, but\nthis now seems unlikely and\nindeed was strongly refuted by\nDr Jowitt in an interview with\nFELIX this week. Dr Jowitt also\nsaid he was not bothered one way\nor the other regarding the\nappointment of the additional\nwardens now or next year. Both\nwardens had agreed that John\nSmith could appoint the\nadditional wardens this year if he\nwished, but they would not object\nto students continuing to occupy\nthe flats.\nPG Handbook\nA Union working party are to put\nforward proposals for an ICU Postgraduate Handbook. The\naims of the publication will be to\nexplain to final year undergraduates what research is like,\nand to provide a general\nintroduction to the PG lifestyle\nfor fresher postgraduates.\nThe handbook will have two\nfunctions. It will be distributed to\npresent undergraduate students,\nat IC and elsewhere, who are\nconsidering applying to do a postgraduate course or research\nat the College.\nThe Handbook is the\nbrainchild of Hugh Stiles, RC C Chairman and a first year\npostgraduate in Chemical\nEngineering. He explained that\nthe idea for the Handbook came\nfrom a document he saw whilst at\nthe NUS Conference in Hull. He\nset up a working party including\nChris Hendy (PG Affairs), Robin\nGraham (SCC) and David Rowe\n( FELIX Editor-elect) to consider\nthe problem. This group will put\nforward their proposals to the\nJoint Council meeting on 22\nJune.\nSinclair Gdns sunk\nResidents of the Head Tenancy\nflats in Sinclair Gardens are\nprotesting about the College's decision to drop the accommodation next session.\nThe decision not to renegotiate\nthe agreement with the landlord\nwas taken as long ago as last\nsummer and was approved by the\nStudent Residence Committee in\nOctober. Student Services Officer\nMichael Arthur told FELIX that\nit was impossible to keep the flats\nfull in the summer vacation since\nthey were a small isolated unit of\nonly four flats with 26 beds in\ntotal. It was uneconomic to\nemploy a summer letting s manager for such a small number\nso it could not be let in the same\nway as Hamlet Gardens. Few\nstudents wanted to live there in\nsummer, and so as a result a lot of\nmoney was lost. In 1982/3 as a whole (including the summer\nvacation) the flats lost \u00a34,516.\nIn a letter to FELIX( see page\n2) Student Manager Caroline\nLow claims the flats offer\nperfectly good accommodation\nand have only been losing money\nas a result of the Student Services\nOffice's failure to let them in the\nsummer.\nMiss Low has offered to\nattempt to let the flats personally\nover this summer, if this will lead\nto a review of the College's decision. The College will have to\nkeep the flats on until September\nin any event as the present\nagreement does not expire until\nthen and they have been included\non this year's summer accommodation application forms for IC students. But the\nCollege is unlikely to reverse its\ndecision unless it is confident that\nno losses will be made in the\nfuture.\nThe motorised mascots of RCSU and Guilds Union repaid a debt on Saturday by providing the bridal car and fire engine\nescort at the wedding of the son of Mr A Dowden, supervisor of\nthe Mech Eng workshops. JezabelandBoenerges are serviced\nand repaired in the workshops and the mascots Mike, Theta\nand Spanner & Bolt were made there. Mr Dowden's son,\nStorm, was marrying Elizabeth Wakefield, secretary to the\nHead of the Department of Mineral Resources Engineering.\nAfter the wedding the mascots gave joy rides around College\nfor the guests and children.\nNo 6771 FELIX, June 8, 1984 I Frejl\n\n"

    "content": "Links MCPs get\noff scot-free\nTwo senior Guilds Union\nmembers who chanted 'no\nwomen in the bar' to a number of\nfemale students in the Union Bar\nhave not been disciplined by the\nUnion Executive. A complaint\nwas brought by Diane Love, AP Editor, and Hugh Stiles, RC C Chairman, about the offensive\nbehaviour of about a dozen\nmembers of the Links Club,\nincluding Jim Boucher, Guilds\nAcademic Affairs Officer, and\nSteve Bishop, last year's Guilds\nPresident. The Executive met last\nFriday to consider the complaint,\nand decided merely to write to the\nstudents concerned expressing\nthe hope that such incidents\nwould not be repeated.\nThe incident took place on\nThursday 24 May shortly before\nclosing time when the group of\nstudents entered the bar. It was\nclear they had already been\ndrinking for some time. They\nproceeded to chant phrases such'\nas 'no women in the bar' and 'get\nyour tits out, girls'. This caused\nconsiderable embarrassment to\nthe five women present in the bar.\nIn a letter to the Executive\nMiss Love said she felt that it was\nintolerable that 'individuals\nritually harass women who are\nenjoying their right and privilege,\nas members of IC Union to drink\nin the Union Bar.' She also went\non to say that she did not object\nto the singing of bawdy rugby\nsongs since these songs, although\ncrude, only concerned fictional\ncharacters. She felt that by\nchanting 'no women in the bar' the\nLinks Club were insulting real\npeople to their faces, simply\nbecause they are female.\nThe Links Club is an all male\ndrinking club, elected from\nmembers of Guilds usually from\nGuild sUn ion.IC Union President Gaynor Lewis told\nFELIX she did not object to this\ntype of behaviour and did not\nthink it would put women off\ncoming to Imperial.\nBadge of Honour\nIt was learnt this week that Roger\nSerpell, a technician in the\naeronautical department, has\nbeen awarded the Badge of\nHonour of the British Red Cross\nSociety. The Badge is given by the\nSociety in recognition of exceptional service and carries\nspecial significance for Mr Serpell since it's more normally\npresented to retiring members.\nHis involvement with the\nBRCS goes back twelve years but\nit is during the last eight years,\nwhilst working as a technician in\nAero, that he has made an impact\non College life. During that time\nhe founded the B RCS Detatchment at College (of\nwhich he is commandant), helped\nto obtain the College ambulance\nwhich was purchased with Rag\nfunds in 1978, and taught many\nhund res of students first aid at his\nregular courses.\nParsons narrowly beaten\nBritain's top high jumper Geoff Parsons, a first year student in the\nMineral Technology department, narrowly failed to automatically\nqualify for the Olympic Games when he was beaten by his rival Mark\nNayler at the Crystal Palace Olympic trials on Wednesday.\nAlthough both athletes cleared the same height of 2m22 cm, the\nOlympic qualifying standard, Mark Nayler won because he took fewer\nattempts.\nDI BIT WEEKEND tor two /#,\nIf you have successfully answered the questions in last\nweek's travel quiz you are well on your way to winning a fabulous weekend for two in Paris!

    "content": "THE GAS PEOPLE\nUORKING FOR TOMORROW'S WORLD TODAY A If your home uses gas \u2014 and the chances are it\nwill, since British Gas is the largest single supplier\nof heat in Britain \u2014 then you are benefiting from\nyesterday's planning and investment in advanced\ntechnology by the gas people.\nYesterday's research anticipated the needs of\ntoday's customers, and some of the developments\nproduced by the gas people were revolutionary.\nDid you know, for instance, that the gas people\nhelped to pioneer the technology for transporting\ngas across the world's oceans \u2014 gas which would\notherwise be wastefully flared-off? This was done\nby cooling the gas into liquid form at minus 160\u00b0C and carrying it in specially designed tankers. The\ntransportation of LNG is now a major world trade.\nThe gas people also saw opportunities in newly-available gas-making feedstocks and developed the\nCatalytic Rich Gas process for making gas from oil,\nrather than coal. Advances like these underpinned\nthe transformation of an ageing industry into a highly competitive and rapidly expanding modern\nbusiness.\nThe gas people went on to exploit the natural gas\nwhich they had helped to discover around our\nshores. To achieve this they constructed a network of\nunderground high pressure steel pipelines to the\nhighest standards. A great deal of money and technical expertise were expended in devising a means of\ninspecting these pipelines, and a sophisticated\nelectronic and mechanical device called an\n'intelligent pig' was developed. It works inside the\npipeline while the gas is still flowing.\nTOMORROW'S WORLD\nYesterday, the gas people solved what would\nhave been today's problems, and we've given you\njust a few examples. But you may be more interested\nin the work we're doing today to solve tomorrow's. For instance, in readiness for the time when\nBritain's indigenous supplies of natural gas begin to\ndecline, and nobody knows when that will be, the gas\npeople have already developed the technology for\nproducing substitute natural gas from coal. The\nresults of this pioneering work are being viewed with\ngreat interest in many parts of the world. Whichever\nfeedstock is available al a competitive price, however,\nthe gas people intend to have the technology to\nproduce a substitute natural gas from it.\nAnd because gas will still be there for\ntomorrow's customers, the gas people are helping to\ndevelop a new generation of appliances for to-morrow's low-energy homes. They are starting to\napply ways of recuperating waste heat in industrial\nand commercial applications by using gas engine-driven heat pumps. These reverse the normal process by which heat flows from a high temperature\nto a lower and so can consume less energy than they\ndeliver!
