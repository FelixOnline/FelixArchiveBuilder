Also the smear\ncampaign conducted by the\nmedia on behalf of some\nwill age idiot who branded\nMr Thorpe a pout.\nSo, let us take a look at the\nLiberal Party. Dog-food\ngourmet Clement Freud and\neverybody s favourite pumpkin\nCyril Smith. Then there is\nDavid Steel, John Pardoe and\nDavid Penhaligon \u2014 Penhali\nwho?\nHow about the Lords?\nWell, we all know about\nLord (Eric Lubbock) Avebury\nand also Lord (lost all his\nmoney) Beaumont. So what?\nCredibility is what it's all\nabout, of course.\nAt the last two elections, the Liberal Party announced\nthat it was now being taken\nseriously by a large proportion\nof the electorate \u2014 all that was\nneeded was a little faith.\nSince then, one can only say\nthat the Party has steadily\ngone downhill in popularity\nand especially in the credibility\nstakes. Is the Liberal Party\nanywhere near the stage of\nleading the country back on\nits feet again?\nYes. And that is the answer\nfrom the rank and file of\nthe Liberal Party. The tens\nof thousands of active party\nworkers up and down the\ncountry believe that there is\nvery much all to play for.\nThere are many, many loonies\nin the other two parties, yet it\nseems that there is truth\nindeed in the old saying, Safety in Numbers.\nThe few Liberal MPs stand alone under the awesome\nbanner of Liberalism - alone,\nthat is, in Parliament, and\ntheir stand is admirable\nconsidering the odds against\nmaking any impact at all. Out in the country, the\nmasses rally to the party\ncall. Never has support for\nthe Party leadership been\nstronger than it is today.\nWhen the other two parties\nare attacked by the media,\nthey cringe and sulk. The\nLiberals, however, take up\nthe challenge and strive\nharder for just ic, equality\nand freedom for the individual.\nThe Liberal Party has\nbeen mauled by the Press and\nTV like never before - but\nfar from being\nfight has only\nThe Party is\nleadership.\nSo beware Harold, beware\nMaggie, the Liberals are\nafter your blood!\nSo speaks the ever-active\nLiberal Club of Imperial\nCollege._, Sheyne\ndefeated, the\njust begun,\nproud of its\nLucock\nTHIS WEEK the fourth talk\nin the Women's Studies Course\nwill be given, the role of\nWomen in History being the\ntopic for discussion.

IC started well on\na completely solid pitch and\nsoon looked the better side\nunder the conditions. With\na great deal of movement from\nthe forwards, (probably trying\nto avoid frostbite) the hospital\ndefence was soon under\npressure; Trev Tutu causing\nall sorts of problems on the\nright wing. However ICs first\ngoal came from a Sig Golding\ncross, well picked up by Trev\nTutu whose shot hit the post\nhalf way up, and Bob Middleton\nscored from the rebound.\nWith the midfield trio\npicking up most of the loose\nballs( brass monkeys beware),\nIC looked much the better side\nup to half time, when, all the\nteam were provided with cups\nof tea except Trev Tutu who\nwent to make sure the changing\nroom was locked.\nDespite a shaky start to the\nsecond half, IC gradually\nmoved beck into the game,\nNigel Woodhouse at centre\nhalf having a fine match.\nNow we come to the highlight\nof the game, the second goal,\nscored from I fanfares\nTrumpets i a short comer.\nA Mike Isles shot was deflected\nand A lister Ross scored from\nclose in. IC now had the\ngame secured, St Bernards 2nd in the League, started to get\nfrustrated and the game began\nto get a bit physical. However\nin the end IC finished the\ndeserved winners with a good\nteam performance, well worth\nthe two points.\nTeam:- C Brown, J Marshall,\nJCook, KHoulden, N Woodhouse,\nJ Andrews, S Golding, M Isles,\nR Middleton, A Ross, T Tutu.\nLast minute goal\nearns ICa draw\nImperial College XI 2\nCity University 2\nAFTER THE good performance\non the previous Saturday, the\n1st XI started well against\nCity, most of the play being\nin their half for the first 20\nminutes. This was rewarded\nby a fine opportunist goal from\nRamesh Fat ania mid way\nthrough the half. However\nconcentration lapsed at the\nback and two goals were\nquickly c once ede d just before\nhalftime.\nCity started the second\nwell and at one point looked\nset for a win, but IC fought\nback and gradually the play\nswitched to the other end.\nDespite the pressure, the\nnecessary goal was not\nforthcoming and City, still\nlooking good on the break,\nalmost scored again, Hugh\nBarrat saving well on the line.\nHowever with the last hit of\nthe match, Sig Golding scored\nfrom a Trev Tutu cross after\nBob had missed the ball\nagain (dummy?)\nOn reflection a good fight\nback, but it would have been\nunnecessary had the defence\nbeen tig her in the first half.\nGood performances from\nRamesh Fat ania and John\n(the Umpire) Latter. (\nTeam: C Brown, J Marshall, H Barrett, K Houlden, A Brown,\nJ Andrews, S Golding, R Ratania,\nR Middleton, A Ross, T Tutu.\nAching men's feet\nTHE WEEK started with an\neventful run against Brunei\nand Surrey Universities, the\nlatter an unexpected guest\nteam, who then demanded a tea.\nThe race was won by the\nman with the watch, Rob\nAll in son in 28.10. A minute\nlater the pride of the IC team\nwas restored, after a prolonged\nspring in by Ian Ellis who\njust managed to defeat J Mahon, inflicting on him the\nsame punishment that Rob\nwas given last season. The\nIC team managed to win by\nscoring six runners (any\nother number would have lost\nus the match) by the effort of\nDave 'have a Carrot' Jones and\nRich 'I don't believe the time'\nHarrington.\nAfter a bad run on the\nWednesday, Andy ' Flake r' Davey made a classic non-appearance at the Southern\nCounties CrossCountry Championships. The temperature\nwas below zero, and the\nground was frozen. In spite\nof this, eleven IC runners\nclocked up almost 100 miles\nin this gruelling race.\nRob All in son once again\nled the team home in 92nd position, Dave Rosen of\nOrienteering fame came next\nfor IC finding the going more\nto his liking than Steve \" It's a real race\" Webb, who came\nnext.\nBadminton\nCongratulations\nAS A RESULT of the competition\nplayed on Sat 17, Mon 19,\nMon 26 of January we wish\nto congratulate the following\nplayers for winning the various\nevents:\nLadies singles: Sal I ie Calhoun\nLadies doubles: Wendy Lowe\nand Jan Mullen\nMens doubles: John Gowlett\nand R(?) Parripatyadar\nMixed doubles: Richard\nTrubger and Jan Mullen\nThe mens singles which\nremains unplayed will be\nbetween Parr i. and the winner\nof the other semi-final between\nAndy Stott and Richard Trubger.\nMany thanks to all who\ntook part and yet did not win -Better luck next time l All the starters for IC\nfinished the course, a com end able performance,\nconsidering the distance and\nthe number of frozen ruts just\nwaiting for someone to sprain\nan ankle in.\nThe after-race enquiry was\nheld in \" The Flack\" and it\nconcluded that we couldn't have done better if we had\ntried, however by the \" Horse and Groom\" some members\nhad thought a little more\ntraining might be in order,\nand by the Nags Head had\ndecided ' to get up the next\nmorning to do some! Who\ncan blame them with the\nSt Edmund Hall relay so close? Table Tennis\nIC overwhelmed\nImperial College 2nd0 Paddington 1st9 FOR THE FIRST time this\nseason both IC table tennis\nteams were beaten in their\nrespective fixtures. At the\nstart of the week the unbeaten\ndivision leaders came to IC\nand showed why they are\nthe league's best team by\noverwhelming our regular\nsecond team 9\u20140. This ends\nthe teams run of 7 league\nvictories in succession and\nvirtually secures the division title for Paddington 1st. Promotion\nchances cut\nImperial College 1st4 Paddington 2nd5 If this wasn't enough their\nsecond team became the\nfirst team to win against IC\n1st on their home ground. At\none ' stage -IC were 3\u20141 up,\nbut the writing was on the wall\nwhen Paddington won two\ngames after deuces in the\nfinal sets. It now seems almost\ncertain that IC 1st won't win\ntheir league, and unless the\nteam improves, it could even\ndrop to third place, and so\nfail to get promotion. Let's hope next week sees a change\nin form.\nby Trevor Walker\n\n"

    "content": "FIU X5 External Eclairs\nLAST MONTH the Consultative\nCommittee for Co-ordinating\nDiscussion on the Recommendations of the Murray Committee\npresented its fifth and final\nreport, in which it recommended\nthat the Committee be wound\nup. So now the ball is in our\ncourt, that is, we must think\nabout what sort of federal\nuniversity we wish to be\npart of, if any. The most important recommendation of the\nCommittee, which reported in\n1972, was that the University\n(of London) should ask Parliament for the power to\nalter its own statutes without\nrecourse to Parliament. It is\nexpected that the University\nwil submit the Bill for the\n1976-77 session of Parliament.\nBoth University College,\nand King's College are seeking\nto obtain their own charters\nand statutes and when these\nare granted, these colleges will leave the University\n(of London). Imperial College will then be the largest\ncollege in the University,\nand will retain the present\nfinancial arrangements, at\nat least through the f97782 quique n niu m. For those of you\nwho do not know about the\nlatter, the UGC makes a recommendation to the Senate,\nwhen allocating money for the\nUniversity as to how much of\nthe allocation should go to\nIC. This recommendation\nis always followed by the\nSenate.\nI should be interested to\nreceive comments on the\nmatter of the University\nand might possibly raise it\nat the next Union meeting of\npeople who are interested.\nSt Andrews d is affiliates from NUS Last week St Andrews voted\nto leave, the National Union\nof Students by 1,384 votes\nto 6 5 3 . It is also reported\nthat two Cambridge colleges have decided to leave, no\ndoubt prompted by the recent\nantipathy shown towards such\ncolleges by the NUS Executive. As this article has to be\nsubmitted before the vote at\nManchester (on Wednesday),\nthe result will be elsewhere\nin FELIX. I expect the result\nto be closer than at St Andrews,\nbut a higher turnout can be\nanticipated.\nDerrick Everett\nPhotographic Society\nLewinski lectures\nSit I.C MR JS LEWINSKI is to visit\nthe College on February 10th to give a lecture on modern\naspects of 35mm photography.\nMr Lewin ski, who is a senior\nlecturer at the London College of Printing, has had many of his photographs published in\nleading Sunday newspapers and\nin August 1970, the National\nPortrait Gallery bought 60\nof Mr Lewin ski's prints for a permanent collection. In 1972,Mr Lewin ski also\nheld a one-man exhibition at\nthe Gallery. In addition, he\nhas recently published a book\nentitled, \" Colour in focus\". The book is the first of its\nkind in its attempt to assess and evaluate the nature of\nphotography as an independent,\ncreative medium of expression. It deals extensively with\nmatters pertaining to subject\ntreatment, design and composition in colour.\nThe lecture being given will\nalso include discussion on\nphotography from the photo-journalist's point of view. The lecture will be held in the\nGeology Lecture Theatre (room\n2.28 in the Royal School of\nMines) and begins at 7.00pm. Cross Country\nHyde Park Relay\nThe Cross Country Club's major home event of the\nyear is to be held on Saturday\n21st February, beginning at\n15.00hrs at the Western end\nof Rotten Row.\nAbout 100 entries have been\nreceived for the event from\nstudent teams from all over\nthe Country as well as from\nthe Continent.\nEach runner will attempt to\ncomplete a3 mile circuit of\nthe Park as one of a team of\nsix running consecutively.\nA good time for a six man team\nwould be in the order of\n11\n/i hours.\nA number of marshal Is\nare needed to direct the\nrunners on their correct\ncourse and any offers of\nhelp in this respect would\nbe rewarded by a free tea\nplus a mystery item which, for security reasons, cannot\nbe revealed until the day. Marshalls would be required\nfrom 14.00hrs until about 17.00\nhrs. If you think you may be\nable to assist, please contact\nRichard Harrington (by a note\nin ' H' of the Union letter\nrack) or any member of the\ncross-country club.\nThis event is the largest\nof its kind in the Country,\nand is being supported by\nthe National Westminster\nBank.\nStater Patter\nWhat are you doing this\nsummer?\nWe have obtained, at\nconsiderable expense, several\nbooks which could help you\nwhen looking for something\nto do this summer. The titles\nare as follows: 1976 Summer\nEmployment Directory of the\nUS, 1976 Summer Jobs in\nBritain,1976 Summer Jobs\nAbroad, Jobs and Careers\nAbroad, Travellers Survival\nKit Europe. These are all available for reference in the\nWelfare room on the top floor\nof the Union Building, and on\na preliminary inspection\nseem most useful. The1976 Jobs available books are\nbroken down into areas, in this\ncountry and abroad, and the\nopportunities vary from fruit\nand hop picking to milkmen.\nThe Travellers Survival Kit Europe\" gives a great insight\ninto the countries of Europe,\ntelling you how to travel\ncheaply, the most economical\naccommodation, where to eat,\nand where to find the best\nnightlife. An indispensable\nbook for the traveller. Longer\nrange job and career prospects\nabroad are dealt with in\n\" Jobs and Careers Abroad\", which outlines job opportunities\nin many countries and so if\nyou are contemplating a career\nabroad why not pop up and\nconsult this.\nSelf-Catering Halls?\nKitchen Fee? The college refectories are\nheading, if things continue as\nat present, for another large\ndeficit at the end of this year.\nAfter the forty percent increase\nof last summer the takings\nin refectories have only gone\nup by eight per cent. I do\nnot feel that the solution that\nwill be adopted for this problem\nis going to be another massive\nprice increase. So, what are\nthe alternatives?\nThere have been several\nsuggestions so far and the\nfirst two of these are aimed\nat increasing the refectories\nfixed income. A\" kitchen fee\" which would be paid by all members of the college to\ncover the refectories fixed\ncosts is a possibility. People\neating in the refectories\nwould then only have to pay\nthe cost of food. It is not\nsure whether this fee would\nbe met by each students\nLocal Authority, although I personally doubt this. The other possibility is to make\nthe Southside halls of residence\nfull or partial boarding. Each resident would then have to\npay for a certain number of\nmeals a week and take those\nmeals in Southside Refectory.\nThe third suggestion that I have heard is that we start\nto close refectories and\nconcentrate on one or two\nareas.\nI shall be glad to receive\nany comments on these suggested\nalternatives.\nRoyal College of Art\nRefectory\nI have received a complaint\nfrom the new President of the\nRCA about the number gf IC\nstudents using their Refectory\nat ' lunch t^ me. Many of the\nRCA students are fed up with\nqueueing for a long time\nbehind IC students. I have\nbeen asked to remind you that\nIC students should not use the\nRCA Refectory before one\no' clock and must pay a10p surcharge. These two rules\nare going to be enforced far\nmore strictly in the near\nfuture. You have been warned,\nso don't come moaning if you\nare thrown out of RCA at ten\nto one.\nNew Hall of Residence\nThe ability to announce a benefaction to enable an\nextension to L instead Hall to be built is one of the\nevents of this year that\ngave me great pleasure. It is\na marvellous gesture on the\npart of one individual to see\nthat IC is able to fulfil its purpose properly which it is feared it cannot without a large proportion of students\nin residence. I have written\nto the an on omo us benefactor\nto express our thanks.\nI hope that the building\nwork will be able to start\nquickly, though I would not\nexpect the new extension to\nbe habitable for at least\nthree years.\nPete\nLetter\nDear Sir,\nI would I ike to ask those\nwho would d is affiliate to\nconsider tho position of\nB'it ish students should all colleges and coal m nes, both distributed fairly randomly\naround the country, both\nhaving \" similar\" union\nstructures and both striving for\nthe betterment of the bodies\nthey represent.\nNow think back to the last\ngreat coal strike and ask yourself; where does the\npo war of this body lie? Is It\nIn individual action of local\nmines or in consolidated action\nof the National union? It is a simple step to compare\njust how effective IC Union\non its own will be when\ncompared to the pressure our\nnational body can bring\nupon our effective employer,\nthe Government.\nFo>' th3 Ti.jj or it yo' students\nat IC who need a simple\nquestion, ask yourself, \" Dp you need a national representative body or not?\". Questions\nconcerning Chile, Angola and\nso on are policy matters that\ncan be changed by sufficient\ndisapproval; do not destroy\nthe NUS over mino c political\nmatters.\nYours faithfully,\nKENNETH FB OWN ES ISU\n\n"

They are indeed an epic story of Hal's progress from his dissolute life with Falstaff and his companions in\nEastcheap to the field at Agincourt.\nAlan Howard gives a marvellously\ncontrolled performance; as Hal both in\nEastcheap and at court where he\nresolutely faces his father's wrath. It is\nin the two reconciliation scenes, before\nShrewbury in part 1 and before his\nfather's death in part 2, that the drama\nreally comes alive. Henry IV, played by\nEmrys James, makes no pretence of the\nfact that, now he has wrested the crown\nfrom his cousin Richard II, he is going\nto die a natural death with the crown still\nfirmly in place. In part 1 it is the threat\nfrom Northumberland that he fears most.\nNorthumberland's son, Harry Percy (Stuart\nWilson), makes a telling contrast with\nHal as he raves on the iniquities that\nthe king has visited on his family. In\npart 2, as the king is near to death, it is\nthe apprehension that his kingdom may\nbe lost by his son that worries him most;\nhere Hal's more patriotic brothers who\nsupport their father's every move are\nused as the yardstick by which we can\nmeasure Hal's transgressions.\nBrewster Mason's Falstaff towers over\nall the others. Not only is he remarkably\nfat, a state that can be achieved by\njudicious padding, but he seems' to have\ngreater height, in his bare feet, and a larger head than anyone else. Unfortunately\nhe gives the impression that he has\nplayed the part so often in the past that\nit has now become a bore.\nTerry Hands is clearly in control in\nthese magn if ici ent productions. Shakespeare\nleft very few stage directions in the\ntext but the wealth of imaginative detail\nthat has been put in deserves the highest\npraise.The three plays have been examined\nin the finest detail for possible doubles\nentendres and i dio sync rac ies of character\nin the text, making the performances\nmore comprehensible than most Shakespeare\nproductions are to modern audiences.\nThomas Stevenson\nMusic High voltage Runt\nTodd n und gren' s UTOPIA Another Live( Bearsville)\nI must admit that I 've always had\nsomething of a penchant for Rundgren's music. Todd is still a more viable\nproposition at his self-indulgent nadir\n(ie his last two albums) than many of\nthe poseurs that have found their way\nonto the turntables of unsuspecting\npunters.\nThis live album is far and above\na better record than Utopia or Initiation,\nnot that it is without a few faults typical\nof the Runt. Most of them come with\nthe only acoustic feature ' Wheels', which shows the man at his most lyrically\nasinine, the melody too is pretty non-de script. The song is flanked by two\nother new tunes. 'Another Life', which\nopens the album, could be plucked from\nthe A WAT Sel pee, showing Todd' s music at its melodic and industrious best,\nthe song being full of the high voltage\nelectricity which permeates the rest of\nthe album. 'Seven Rays', although again\nlyrically doubtful, has enough going for\nit to sustain the listeners interest.\nAgain high on melodic content, the\nsong employs at various stages up to\nthree synthesis er players, providing a controlled barrage of warp sound. Rundgren\nis one of the few people who can use\nexcessive techno-flash and still make\nviable music, unlike say EL P, who\nhave mastered the technique of musical\nfarting.\nSide two opens with ' Intro/ MrT risc u its', a short instrumental excursion featuring\nthe Human Cap ic it or dueling it out with\na lively synthesis er. Only Rundgren\ncould then let the tune fall effortlessly\ninto a Be m stein/ Sondheim standard\nfrom West Side Story, namely 'Somethings\nComing', without making a complete\np izz le of himself. IT works beautifully.\nWe are then treated to two straight rockers,\nthat is if any of Rundgren's music can\nbe called 'straight'. The brilliant\n'Heavy Metal Kids', sticks pretty close to the high energy original that appeared\non the ' Todd' double, the Runt's acid\nguitar solo mixed down with the band,\nbut still managing to penetrate the\nmelee of notes provided by the rest of\nthe musicians. Then it's straight into\nthe old Move number ' Do Ya', which is\nalmost as good as the latter. Finally, the band return to ground control with\nContinued from page 3\nProfile: Riz Shakir\n\"If students feel that a national\nbody like NUS is not required at all,\nin any shape or form, then we should\nd is affiliate... it we think that there is\na need for a national body which\nrepresents our views, negotiates on our\nbehalf, runs a profitable travel service,\nhas competent leadership \u2014 (this is\nwhat NUS could be if a little bit of\neffort was made by the average student) \u2014\nthen they should vote to stay in\".\nIf what students desired was a change in NUS, then he felt the best\nway to do this was from within NUS for\nthe simple reason that our voices would\nnot be listened to or even heard from\nwithout.\nRi z is an independent sort of chap,\nand this is reflected in his plans when\nhe leaves college. He hopes eventually\nto run a business of his own. Although\ntime has prevented him playing the various\nand multitudinous sports he enjoys, there\nhas not been too much of an obstacle to\nhis favourite sport \u2014 shooting.\nHe sums it up: \"Perhaps above\neverything else, my interest is shooting.\nThis is something a lot of people\nreserve opinion about and I respect\ntheir opinions. But, I think, with all\ndue respect, they don't know what it\ninvolves. A shooting person knows a great deal more about the animals,\nunderstands them much better, because\nyou have to learn their habits and\nbehaviour. This brings one closer to\nnature and since man is an integral\npart of nature, it improves one's understanding of mankind\".\nThis then is Ri z Shakir, a man of\nas so nate personality; with 'definite\nthe sedate ' Just One Victory' culled from the A WAT S album.\nJust, how much of this twelve inch\npiece of plastic is truly a'live' album,\nrecorded as it happened is anybody's guess. I mean as far as production goes\nthis man is such a master of the overdub\nhe makes Mike Oldfield look positively\nclumsy. For instance, I was a little\ndisappointed with his performance at\nHammersmith a few months back, feeling\nthat his band Utopia played it all a bit\nflat, not creating any real 'atmosphere'.\nYet a couple of weeks ago, Radio One\nput out an 'In Concert' (produced and\nre-mixed by Rundgren) of this very\nsame gig, and to hear that you'd have\nthought it one of the best performances\nby an artist in years. I suppose science has finally got to grips with rock' n' roll. Anyway, what has to be judged is the\nend product and as far as that goes, this\nrecord is on the whole very fine indeed.\nRecommended for anyone who was\nunfortunate enough to pick up on Rundgren\nwith his last two efforts, and so perhaps\nmisjudge the man's talent.\nIan Morse\nDear FELIX Readers,\nAs you may have noticed, the\nbanner is not in red as usual.

Speaking to a Union General\nMeeting there, he stated his belief that the disenchantment\nwith NUS was based on two\nideas: that the political decisions of governments and\nParliament have no real effect\nupon students and that even\nif they did, the NUS could\nhave no real influence over\nthe decisions. \"Bui\", he said, \"students\nare not immune from the\neconomic , position which\naffects all of us.\" He outlined\nthe effects of the present\neconomic crisis on the education\nsector in particular. The closure of teacher-training\ncolleges, the cutting back of\ndiscretionary grants by local\nauthorities and the closure\nof n nili rsi ib scribe d courses, he thought were all a direct\nresult of the Government's decision to reduce public\nspending.\nBut this was not the only\nway in which students were\naffected.

    "content": "MU X3 IC is a cliquish college\nPROFILE: Riz Shakir\nBORN IN the Punjab, Ri z Shakir\neventually arrived in England at the\nage of 13 after having lived in various\ncountries from the far east to the far\nwest to join his parents. He came to\nIC from a sixth form college in\nLeicestershire. The school is still recovering from the reverberations of\nthe revolutionary wind of change which\nswept'it during Ri z' s presence.\nIt is with the same energy and gusto,\nthat he has approached his job as\nDeputy President of Imperial College Union. Being a surprise candidate at\nthe election, he was something of an\nunknown quantity. However, he has\nsince proved to quite a few people,\nincluding his department, that he can\ncope with the job and do it adequately\nwhilst simultaneously pursuing a degree\nin Chemistry.\nHe himself says of the job: \" / think\nI have lived up to what I intended to do,\nbut there's a lot more I'd like to do\".\nThe job of DP is one of the most difficult\nin the Union to carry out, he says. A sabbatical DP would be useful although\na restructuring of the Union and\nredefinition of the job description would\nfirst be required.\nThe extent to which students relate\nto the Union is minimal and this, he\nsays, is because it has been allowed\nto become a political stepping stone\n(with the exception of this year, of\ncourse). Another contributory factor is\nthat the sabbatical officers are so\noverloaded with work that they are\nunable to go out and meet with the\nstudents they represent. \"A situation\nhas been reached where ICU is regarded\nsolely as a political entity rather than\na social and cultural one as well, which\nin fact it is\", he says. \"IC could retain its reputation by\nproducing graduates with good degrees\nand without de human ising them in the\nprocess\". IC students are apathetic, not because\nthey wish to be, but because the system\nforces them to be so. Far too much\nemphasis is put into keeping up the\nCollege's academic reputation. This demands that IC students be put through\nintensive courses, which are not only\nboring, but deny them the opportunity\nto broaden their education \u2014 he stated\nthis, meaning that IC turns out computer\nlike people instead of educated human\nbeings.\n\"IC could retain its reputation by\nproducing graduates with good degrees\nand without de human ising them in the\nprocess\".\nHe is worried that very little is\nbeing done to make courses interesting\nand he knows of many cases in which\nstudents have had to be persuaded to\ncontinue with their courses. \"Little or\nno consideration is given to the varying\ninterests of students which might otherwise give them the stimulus to continue\nwith their courses\". Courses, he feels,\nare structured very impersonally and\nwithout much thought for the student\ntaking the degree.\nThis impersonal atmosphere bred the\ncliques which permeate the College; a result of students spending too much\ntim r in the company of only those\nstudents in their own course. \"IC is a cliquish college , ne says in a damning\ntone. \"If you don't form a clique, then\nyou're out\".\nOverseas students are a particular\nexample of this phenomena of clique\nforming.\" They come out of their countries,\nmore often than not from a different\nculture, and are made to feel ill at home\".\nThe alien culture, language and\nem baras s ment over their spoken English forces them to form cliques of their own\ncountrymen \u2014 a situation which leads to\nvery little or no racial integration.\n\"This is totally at odds with IC's reputation as an international centre of\nlearning\".\nHe takes a principled stand against\nthe proposed increases in the fees of\noverseas students because, he says,\nmany of them come from poor countries.\nHe does not expect them to take a stand\nagainst the fees increase, lest they\nare deported.\n\"We have to stand up and help these\npeople \u2014 people, who like us, would\nlike knowledge, but are not being given\nthe same opportunities to learn \u2014 just as\nwe would stand up for our own grants to\nbe raised, we must campaign on their\nbehalf after due consultation with them\".\nMoreover, he stresses that the problem\nis a humanitarian rather than a political\none and should be seen as such. \"ICWA, although not perfect, is at\nthe moment, an essential part of the\nUnion...\" The problems of overseas students\nat IC are closely linked with those of\nthe postgraduate students of whom\n50% are from overseas. Ri z agrees\nwith the Rector, Sir Brian Flowers, that\nthe Union does not cater adequately\nfor PG s. \"However, the question of\nhow to get PGs more involved in the\nUnion is a much more difficult one\",\nhe says. There are two main areas in which\nhe sees possible solutions developing.\nThe lack of involvement amongst PG s is\nexacerbated by the very small laboratory\nunits into which they are split. One\nway to bring them together is for the\nCollege to organise more associated\nstudies lectures, (which they are given\ncredit for), specifically for PG s thus\naiding integration and social ising. This, he feels, would provide a basis for unity\namong PG s. \"The Union itself should try and\norganise a lot more events for PGs\".\nIf the Union should find itself at a loss as to the type and kind of functions\nit should organise, then it could try\nfinding out through those PG s who\nare already active in the Union. He\nalso does not think that there is sufficient\nprovision for married students (many are\nPG s) in College owned accommodation.\nAnother group of IC students whom\nhe feels, are similarly hard done by are\nthe women \"ICWA, although not perfect,\nis at the moment, an essential part of\nthe Union and will develope a lot more\nin the future years\". It is a healthy\nsign, he says, to see discussion being\ninstigated within ICWA on a wide\nvariety of topics affecting women.\n\"It seems IC is either go and swot in\nthe library or go to the bar and drink\nyourself silly...\" However, the attitudes in the College, socially and academically, he says, do\nnot take women's presence into account.\n\"In many cases women are regarded as\nRiz Shakir\npeople who have lost their way into a course\". A poor state of affairs considering we want more women at IC. \"The social structure has to be\nchanged radically before the male to\nfemale ratio can begin to improve.\nAt the moment the social structure is\nvery much based on a drinking man's club \u2014 most of the social functions\ninvolve drinking. It seems IC is either\ngo and swot in the library or go to\nthe bar and drink yourself silly... Firstly,\nthere shouldn't be so much academic\npressure on people as is the case at\nthe moment... Secondly, we have to\nchange social functions from principally\ndrinking to social ising and drinking'.\nToo much emphasis is put on drink in\nhis thinking.\n\" NUS at the moment does very little\nfor students\"\nHis most outspoken comments were/ however, those regarding the National\nUnion. On the question of representation,\nhe states categorically that, \"It (the\nNUS) doesn't represent anybody but the\nfew political activists that are at the top\nor are in the pipeline to replace them in\nturn. It is very much a political stepping\nstone for opportunist students, that is\nall. It does not represent a damn student\nand the opinions that it puts forward are\nvery often those that suit them\".\n\"NUS at the moment does very little\nfor students\".\nThat a national organisation representing students is a great asset, he agrees;\nhowever, his image of such a body is\nvery different to that of NUS at the\nmoment. He does not think that NUS should be a politically motivated body\nand it should restrict its area of concern\nto those issues directly affecting students.\nIf, in any such issues, politics is involved,\nthen fair enough, but otherwise strictly\nno politics. International issues are\nalso out, in his opinion, as regards\ncampaigning work although we should\ndiscuss and adopt policy on them.\nWhilst he thought it extremely useful, at a local level, to liaise with trade\nunions, he was against the ' political grovelling' of the NUS executive to the\nTUC. Despite these attitudes to the National\nUnion, he is, in principle, opposed to\nd is affiliation. Continued on page 4\n\n"

Our\ndesire for further education\ncould be assessed by the\neagerness with which we\npiled into the coach to be\ntaken as quickly and far as\npossible from South Ken.( Those of you who thought\nSilwood Park an educational\nestablishment, think again;\nthey only do Botany and such\nI ike there.)\n\" Not a briefcase in sight,\" I noted as we got off the\ncoach at Sil wood.

After tea, the nitty-gritty\nProf Niblett talked about the\nrapid growth of higher education\nin the last 25 years, and the\nbroadened concepts of higher\neducation. Universities, he\nexplained, have a tendency to\nbe too elitist, too academic,\nand too research-orientated\n(ouch!). Polytechnics, which\noffer more subjects, and\ncater for a wider cross-section\nof students, were introduced in\n1965 for this very reason.\nThe future of higher education\nis in the hands of the increasing\nnumber of people outside the\n18\u201422 age bracket who demand\nit. The open University\ndemonstrates the growth of\nthis demand: it now has\n55,000 students, of all ages.\nYet it still cannot cope with\nthe floods of applications,\nand has to refuse some who\nwish to study with them.\nMoney is the key to increased\navailability of higher education;\nin the 1930's, about \u00a32 million\nSolution to\nCrossword No. 29\nACROSS I.

Now the figure\nexceeds \u00a34000 million (in\n1969, education spending\nsurpassed defence costs for\nthe first time.) Assuming that no more money is available, what there is must be shared.\nThis entails increasing the\nstudent I staff ratio, cuts in\npost grad education (sorry,\nRick), charging overseas\nstudents higher fees, (I plead\nan on imi ty), and a cut down in\nstudent residence (this isn't really written in the comfort\nof a Beit Hal I armchair.)\nBut there are other problems\nto be faced when trying to\nintroduce mass higher education\n(ie for more than 15% of the\n18\u201422 age group), or Universal higher education (over 50%).\nA much wider range of courses\nis needed, and the merits of\npart-time education should be\nfully explored.\nProf Niblett summed up by\ncomparing our higher education\nsystem with those of other\ncountries. He concluded\nthat the poor showing Britain\nmade, compared with Japan,\nfor instance, will prompt the\nGovernment into developing\nhigher education.\nWe returned, refreshed, from\nsupper, to discuss some of the\nquestions raised by Prof\nNib let t's lecture. We all had\na natural interest in the\nsubject, and the mistaken\nimpression that the whole\ncountry revolved around higher\neducation could easily have\nbeen taken by an onlooker.\nThe predicted figure for\n1981 students in higher\neducation is 18% - and doubts\nhave been cast as to whether\nor not demand will continue\nto increase at its current\nrate. \"What about women!\" someone should have shouted,\nbut didn't.( Our demands are\nconstantly increasing.) After\nliquid refreshment, all retired,\nand the discussion resumed\nafter Sunday lunch.\nApart from the distinctly\nmale appearance of the\n\" average student\" of the\nfuture, the weekend's discussions were very successful and\nforward looking. It was with\nregret that we boarded the\ncoach (after another very\nsatisfactory tea) and returned\nto IC.\nIncidentally, College is the\nsubject of the next Touchstone,\nentitled \" IC \u2014 Airport Culture\nor Community\". The guest\nspeaker is our very own\nSinclair Goodlad. I recommend\nit most strongly \u2014 these weekends are enjoyable, informative,\nand incredibly good value.\nSo, if you want a weekend in\nthe country, with as much\nto eat as you can manage,\ngood company, and interesting\nconversation, sign up for the\nnext one.

See Time Out. _ .\nArthur SesquipedalianConcerts\nPower, drive and control\nRENAISSANCE'S CONCERT last Saturday\nwas not . so much an assault upon the\nsense, more a calculated dissection of\nthem. It was a brilliant concert, by any\nstandards; embodying power, drive and\ncontrol to produce one of the best gigs at\nIC for many a day.\nThe scene was set by Bob Pegg, a worthy country folk singer well beloved\nby all Folk Club veterans, who kept the\naudience happy with his usual blend of\nself-composed tales of the North, playing\nhis guitar and tin whistle simply and\neffectively. Indeed some people came to\nsee \" the Bob Pegg concert\"!I would have said that Mr Pegg\nwarmed the audience up, but that would\nnot be strictly true as, in fact, the hall\nwas blood cold, as John Camp remarked\nWhen Renaissance took to the stage at\nlater.\nBy that time, people were getting\nrestless. The TV cameras had trundled\nup and down the packed hall a couple\nof times, and I had finished my can of\nNew ky. The lights suddenly faded, the\nstage was enveloped in darkness, and'\nRenaissance hit town going straight into'\n\"I Can't Understand\". For those of you who know their\nmusic, they played a variety of the old and\nthe new; \" Running Hard\",\" Ocean Gypsy\", \"Mother Russia\",\" Prologue( from way back)\", and the excellent\n\" Scheherazade\", the title work of their\nlast album.\nIf you are not so well acquainted with\nthe band and you did not read FELIX last week, they are a five-man group:\npercussion, piano; acoustic and bass\nguitar and Annie Haslam on vocals. Their\n\" classical influences\" are most prevalent\nin the excellent work of the pianist,\nJohn Tout, whose use of the synthesis er was exemplary. The power behind the\nband's music comes from the drummer,\nTerry Sullivan, and bass man John\nCamp, around whom much of the music\nevolves. He also plays the bass organ\npedals, so, all in all, he is a pretty\nimportant part of their sound.\nThis really is a band to see. The whole concert swept along in a vein of\nvitality and aggression, the band playing\nloud, but maintaining good sound quality.\nIt was refreshing to be actually able to\nhear the words being sung without\nstraining. The use of special effects\naided, rather than detracted from the\nperformance. The encore, \" Ashes Are Burning\",( another LP title track)\nfairly pinned the audience to the floor,\nespecially when John Camp launched\nhimself into his solo.\nAt the end of the piece, no-one\ncalled for another encore \u2014 the band\ncould not possibly have had anything\nmore to give.\nYou may have gathered that I liked\nthis gig \u2014 I did, and so did everyone\nelse there. Thanks, Renaissance. John Downs\nBBC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\nFree tickets are available from\nJen in the Union office. Works are\nby Dvorak and Schubert.\nThurs 12th Feb. First come first served. Doors open\n6.45pm. No admittance after 6.55pm. "
