    "content": "Clubs\nA TOTAL WAY OF LIFE\nFollowing on after the Christian Chaplaincies highly successful Contact Week these past few days, comes a RELIGIOUS\nWEEK organised by the non-Christian religious societies at College, from Monday 13 to Friday 17 February.\nThe Jewish Society are showing the films Chariot* at hire and Cabaret and will be providing refreshments with a Jewish\ntaste.\nThe Baha'i Society are holding an informal discussion speaker meeting similar to their highly successful and highly\nentertaining event last year; and the Islamic Society are organising two meetings during the week, a free lunch and a video\npresentation, and will have a poster display in the J CR Those of us who do have a religious conviction would encourage everyone and particularly those of you who do not to\nconsider the issue of religious beliefs seriously. Perhaps use the week, as v; ell as the previous one, to answer some of the\nquestions about the different groups.\nIncidentally, Christian societies will still be holding their regular meetings.\nNigel Young\nSocial Clubs Committee Religious Societies Rep\nThe Origin of Man and the\npurpose of Existence\nOne of the most influential of all\nmodern philosophers of science\nmust certainly be Sir Karl\nPopper. Last term he came to\nImperial College to speak about\n'Quantum Mechanics'. However\nhis most important thesis, and\none central to all his work, is\nconcerned with the methodology\nand development of science.\nIn his book 'The Structure of\nScientific Revolutions'; Popper\nquestions the way that science\ndevelops. We suffer revolutions\nin science, he says, because we\nblindly follow what is the main\ntrend of the time\u2014like moths\ngathering around a lamp in a darkened room\u2014and ignore all\nother glimmers of ideas, until a new theory has the power to\noverthrow that already in existence. In the 'Logic of Scientific\nDiscovery' he goes on to suggest\nthat if we were more scientifically\nhonest, we would not only express\nassumptions and theories as fully\nas possible, but state the conditions which must prevail before\nwe are willing to relinquish them\nand accept others. Consequently,\nalthough science would be just as\nmethodical, Popper suggests that\nthe growth of scientific knowledge would be more creative,\npositive, and certainly less\nfraught, whilst losing none of its\ndynamic power. Logically, any\nsuch knowledge would then be\nseen as a contribution for a particular time, leaving our intellect and creative energy free to\nexplore other avenues unafraid of\nchange.\nPopper's theories apply to\nreligion just as they apply to\nscience. The same revolution\nhappens in religion when change\ntakes place, facing the same\nrejection and hostility as exists in\nthe scientific and social world.\nHow many such revolutions can\nwe recall? Because we have\nresisted change so much that we\ncould not see when it was\nnecessary. How many times have\nwe rejected ideas not because\nthey are untrue but because we\ndon't like the way they make our\npresent values or methods out of\ndate? And isn't this the basis of\nthe continuing dissension between science and religion? Because we see them.as competing\nrather than, branches of different\nknowledge, one being discovered\nand the other revealed. No one\nseems to realise, for example, that\nthe acceptance of Darwin's theory does not make God redundant as far as creation is\nconcerned.\nThe consequences of our failure to admit that a change is\nnecessary, are very obvious in\nsociety today. No one seems to\nhave a purpose to exist. Will we\nultimately disintegrate, leaving no\ntrace and no fruit? People want to\nprotect our existence\u2014although\nthey can't often say why\u2014or to\ndispense with it altogether because there is no point. Do we\nreally have to reach the brink of\nour own destruction before we\nchange?\nThe Imperial College Baha'i Society has organised a meeting\non 'The Origin of Man and\nPurpose of Existence'. Both\nscientific and religious points of\nviews will be presented. The\nmeeting will be held on Thursday\n16 Feb at 6:30pm in the Senior\nCommon Room. 8th floor,\nPhysics Building.\nIslam and the Muslims\nAny religion which does not\ndemand anything of its followers\nor which leaves those who have\nentered it more or less where they\nwere before they embraced it is an\nineffective religion: a mere set of\nrituals which do not effect the\nconduct of living. ISLAM is not\nsuch a 'religion'\u2014it is not a simple belief system or ideology\nor set of emp tv rituals, rather, IT\nIS A TOTAL WAY OF LIFE, a complete system governing all\naspects of man's existence both\nindividual and collective.\nThe meaning of the world\n'Islam' is 'submission' and\n'peace'. In the course of making\nan individual muslim-iz one who\nis in a state of Islam or peace\nthrough submission to the ONE TRUE GOD\u2014Islam profoundly\naffects his thinking and be-ha vi our. In fact there is no aspect\nof a person's life, individual or\ncommunal, which Islam does not\ntouch and transform in keeping\nwith its basic concept: that of the\nLordship and Sovereignty of\nGod and man's responsibility to\nHim. The first requirement of\nIslam is BELIEF, and its second\nis ACTION. In this age of upheaval and\nuncertainty people everywhere\nare groping for something that\ncan save humanity. Though this\nis an era of the ultimate in\nmaterial civilization and pro-gres s, in the realm of values and\nmorals mankind is close to\nbankruptcy. Islam views these\nproblems as being fundamentally\nof a SPIRITUAL nature: the\nresult of man having lost sight of\nwho he is. and who he is in\nrelation to himself to others, and\nabove all, to God, in whom,\nbeing itself originates. Islam is a view of the total reality encompassing the existance and attributes of the Creator, man's relation with Him, his role and\npurpose in this world, and the\nrelationship between this life and\nthe life of the Hereafter.\nIt may interest you to know\nthat the followers of Islam\nconstitute either the largest single\nreligious community in the world\ntoday, or constitute the second\nlargest according to other est i mates: which range between\n800m and 1 billion. It is a faith\nwhose followers are found in\nevery corner of the world and this\nuniversality stems from the fact\nthat since there is one God and\nlogically the Prophets and the\nrevelations that they were given\ncame from this one God: the\nmessage of Guidance to mankind\nis ONE, and the religion acceptable to God is ONE \u2014 ISLAM.I Friday, February 10, 1984\nTuesday Islamic Society l:002:00 pm Free Lunch Botany Common\nRoom.\nJewish Society Film Night & Refreshments.

    "content": "Letters\nGaynor Freaks Out Dear Pallab\nI was disturbed to note that in\nlast week's FELIX the Selkirk\nHall Disco appreciation society\nfelt that the improvement in the\nquality of a certain food product\nby the Catering Manager should\nhave taken second place to the\nweekly disco in Southside Bar.\nNaturally, Mr Mooney should\ndiversify his interest over the\nwhole of the refectory system,\nthough I have no doubt Mr D Rowe would believe that baked\nbeans should take a higher\npriority than the weekly disco.\nHowever, to set the residents of\nSelkirk Hall at ease\u2014not only\nhas Mr Mooney improved the\nquality of the baked beans in the\nUnion refectory but, contrary to\ntheir accusation, has also agreed\nto purchase new disco equipment\nspecifically for use in the Southside weekly disco, and the\nCollege has undertaken to\nimprove the 'sound proofing' of\nthe Real Ale Bar area such that\nthe discos and maybe even other\nevents will continue on a regular\nbasis! Perhaps Mr Mooney is not\nsuch a 'cheapskate' after all!\nYours sincerely\nGaynor Lewis\nLetters to the Editor are always welcome on any\nsubject at all. They should be submitted to the\nFELIX Office before Monday 1:00pm for inclusion\nin Friday's FELIX.\nTV Tits Dear Pallab\nPlease could you. confirm\nwhether rumours I have been\nhearing about one of the Union\nmedia (not FELIX) are true or\nnot . It has come to my attention\nthat the medium in question has\ndenied membership to certain\nstudents purely on the basis of the\npersonal feelings of the commit-tee. Not content to discriminate\nagainst those they do not like, the\nfriends of the banned students\nhave been feeling the wrath of the\ncurrent Junta. One such friend\nwas to conduct an interview with\na celebrity and had done a great\ndeal of background research only\nto be told that he wouldn't be\ndoing the interview afer all.\nInstead, his place has been filled\nby an ex-member of College who\nhas had no experience of such\ninterviews and who is no longer\nin the union.\nI can already hear the cynical\nsaying, 'So what?' But I believe it\nis important that everyone who\nholds a union card should at least\nbe allowed the opportunity to\njoin every college society. Of\ncourse it will be difficult to prove\nthis state of affairs but if matters\nchange because of this letter then\nthe issue will no longer be\nimportant.\nSuch a change is unlikely, but if\nthe present situation goes on un-criticised, then the video-nas ties will surely have won.\nYours sincerely\nAn innocent bystander\nname and dept supplied.\nSports Slammed Dear Mr Ghosh\nMany congratulations to your\nsports page editor for managing\nto reduce the normal two pages of\nsport to just one side of bland\nreports. We note that only five\nclubs could be bothered to\nsubmit articles which conformed\nto your stringent guidelines.\nWe sincerely hope that you\nmanage to remove the sports\npage altogether by the end of the\nyear.\nYours sincerely\nJohn Harty\nMartin Hall\nactually read FELIX but on the\nassumption that some do we try\nto publicise our events in it, it\nseems, however, that you have\nother plans. If you cast your mind\nback to last term you may\nremember we complained about\nthis to you both verbally and in\nwriting. Needless to say you did\nnot print the letter of complaint\nand you are still as unhelpful as\never. Perhaps if you cut out half\nof those boring film/theatre\nreviews (which nobody I know of\nreads) you might just be able to\nfind room for a paragraph or two\nabout us.\nYours with considerable annoyance\nT Wildish\nChairman, IC Astrosoc\nPS: If this letter gets printed I will\nbe unable to contain my joy.\nEd's Note Clubs articles and\nWhat's On entries will not be\npublished if they are submitted\nafter the Monday 1:00pm deadline. Neither will they be\npublished if they consist of the\ninconsequential irrelevant drivel\nthat you regularly submit\nPriority is given to concise\ninformative articles that\nadvertise forthcoming events.\nObnoxious StarStruck Dear Pallab\nI just thought you might like to\nknow that somebody out here (ie\nme) thinks you are doing a really\npathetic job. Over the last two\nweeks Astrosoc has submitted\ntwo entries for the clubs column\nand two for What's On. Of these\nyou condescended to print part of\nthe last entry for What's On,\nmost generous of you. It may not\nhave occurred to you that people\nmascot ry, but also that many\nregard it as the epitome of\nmindlessness? He even sneers\nthat 95% of Chelsea College\nstudents 'haven't even seen their\nanchor'. \u2014Lucky 95%!\nOutside readers might assume\nthat the letter was written by a typical IC student whereas it was\nin fact written by a typical C CU( RCSU) hack\u2014a very different\nthing.\nI believe that the rift between\nmost IC students and the CCU's is very large, and that the latter's activities can be summed up as\nkissing each others arse s and\npretending they are doing it for\neveryone else's benefit.\nThe strange ratio of the sexes in\nthis College goes hand in hand\nwith the mascot ry mentality and\nthe ratio will only improve as\nscience and technology attracts\nmore rounded personalities al-together.\nYours sincerely\nDave Lock\nPhysics 1\nPS: Read\nhilarious.\nthe letter\u2014it'sHack Dear Pallab\nI suggest that the obnoxious\nSimon Banton's letter in Feb 2's edition of London Student does\nmuch more damage where it\nmatters to this College's image\nthan anything which Michael\nNewman is responsible for.\nIndeed, while Michael Newman's campaign against Mines' ridiculous porn night shows a glint of\nhuman values within the College,\nSimon's ranting letter on mas-co try suggests strongly that the\nwriter is a moron. Is he unaware\nthat not only are the majority of\nLondon students uninterested in\nDear Sir,\nHaving read your report in\nyour January 19th issue, I feel\nyour readers should have the\nrecord set straight as regards\nour Mascdtry activities.\nFirstly:\" Mary\" the\nleopard (which is incidentally\nplaster and wood, not con-crete) belongs to Queen\nMary College, not Chelsea.\nSecondly: Chelsea Col\nleg e's mascot is an anchor,\nnot a leopard.\nThirdly: The ransom paid\nby QM C was a cheque for\n\u00a340 and 80 pints of blood, the\ncheque and a receipt for the\nblood being handed over on }\nWednesday the 11th of Janu- J ary outside the Royal School {\nof Hygiene, opposite SOAS 2\nin Malet Street. In return we\nloaded the leopard into\nQ MC's van in order for them\nto take it home.\nFourthly: To our know- 1\nledge, neither QM C, who\npaid the cheque, nor Chelsea,\nwho didn't, have cancelled it.\nI am glad Steve Woodward\nhas got something to gloat \\\nabout, considering that 95% T. of Chelsea College students \\\nneither know of, nor have /\never seen, their anchor. I Indeed* the majority of stu- J dents there that have heard {\nrumours of a mascot, firmly\nbelieve that it is dumped in\n!\n^he River Thames!\nLastly: It was the Royal\nCollege of Science Union that\nrelieved QM C of their mascot\ntwo years ago, and we are\nproud to be an Independent\npart ot Imperial Colllege!\nYours faithfully\nSimon Banton\nPage 21 I Friday, February 10, 1984\\ FELIX\n\n"

The story has been set in a timeless\nperiod which means that the costumes and\nset suggest mood and characters rather than\nthe usual Victorian image. Thus Strephon can\nwear a 'Save the Whale' T shirt while the\nLord Chancellor wears traditional robes and\nwig. The plot hinges around Phyllis, a ward of\ncourt, and the men who want to marry her\n(the entire House of Lords, the Lord\nChancellor and Strephon an Arcadian C ND supporter). Strephon, who is half fairy, is\naided in his efforts by the ladies chorus\ndressed in diaphanous little numbers which\nare too small for comfort. All this calls for\nconsiderably more dance routines than\nFELIX \u2022 i HH BBBB HnO PSO C are used to but with plenty of\nrehearsals it should look good.\nThe libretto is one of Gilbert's finest with\nthe biting satire about the usefulness of the\nHouse of Lords still as relevant today as in\nthe late 19th Century. Sullivan's music\nsounds almost like Verdi at the dramatic\npoints and never fails to produce a good tune.\nSome of the most popular G&S music comes\nfrom Iolanthe, such as The Peers Chorus\n(Bow, Bow, Ye lower middle classes), Blue\nBlood, When Britain really ruled the waves,\nThe Nightmare Song and the Trio, Faint\nHeart Never Won Fair Lady.\nIf you've never seen a Gilbert and Sullivan\nshow, give this one a try (peoples'\nmisconceptions can be quite considerable). If\nyou've never seen an OP SOC show this may\nbe your best opportunity. If you have seen an\nOP SOC show, this may be different but we\nhope you'll enjoy it.\nPerformances are at 7:30pm in the Union\nConcert Hall from Tuesday 14 February until\nSaturday 18 February. Tickets are on sale\nfrom OP SOC members, IC Union Office, the\nHaldane Library or Level 2 of the Sherfield\nBuilding at lunch times, price \u00a31.50 students\nor \u00a32.00.\nWKHtFhday, February 10, 1984 WKBMM\nPS: If you have ever considered joining the\nsociety (par i cula rly if you are a man) then\ncome backstage during the interval or see us\nin the bar afterwards when we will be only too\npleased to tell you something about the\nsociety.\nStage Crew finishing off a tree for the\nproduction on Tuesday.\nPage 11\n\n"

I had\nbeen looking forward to reading\nit, and yet dreading to start it in\ncase I just couldn't get into it.\nNow, having read the book, I think it does indeed deserve its\nhigh critical acclaim.\nThe novel covers the lifespan\nof twin Welsh border farmers\nfrom childhood until one died at\n80 years of age. Chatwin is forced\nby the nature of his characters to\nwrite much about the countryside. He does so,\nsuccessfully, writing both with\nthe passion of the aesthete and\nan understanding of the farming\ncommunity.\nThe book is a series of short\nchapters each covering events\nfrom some period of the twins'\nlives. The themes running\nconstantly through the t book are\ntechnology, pacifism, the nature\nof a small community and the\nbond between the twins.\nA marvellous experience, and\nwell worth reading.\nJerry Hasnip\nThe Life and Times of\nKJ M Coetzee (Seeker &\nWarby) \u00a37.95\nJ M Coetzee a highly\nacclaimed South African novelist, presents a serious and\nunconventional new book. It is\nthe story of Michael K, who is\nmentally deficient, in his\nattempts to avoid a war that is\nbeing waged in S Africa. Much of\nMichael's behaviour is hard to\nunderstand. He tries to find a place away from the war, but it\nalways catches up on him; part of\nhis struggle is in the form of\nfasting, which is unconscious at\nfirst.\nTowards the end of the book,\nthe format is changed, and the\nstory is told by the medical officer\nof a rehabilitation camp where\nMichael is held. The MOst ruggles to understand Michaels protest. He is\nfrustrated by Michael's star.ee\nbut eventually thinks he\nunderstands him, and is in awe of\nthe protest.\nMichael is just one civilian\ncaught in the reality of war, from\nwhich he cannot escape. But he\ntries to live his life as he wants as\nmuch as is possible, even though\nthis may be life on a very minimal\nbasis. This is a book which\nfrustrates the reader and has him\nin terror of the unpleasant social\nconsequences which are\nune s capable in war.\nJerry Hasnip\n\n"

    "content": "IC vs London Hospital\nWon 2-0\nBristol University Sailing Club were hosts to\nthe London Hospital and Imperial teams at\nthe weekend in the scenic surroundings of\nCheddar.\nImperial sailed Bristol first in rather\nblustery conditions. The first race was hotly\ncontested with some good team racing from\nboth sides. Imperial had a commanding 2,3,4\ncombination by the second leg but at the gybe\nmark Jones (Captain) was a little too over\ngenerous with the roll and ended up with a very deserved capsize. By this time with the\nhelp of Howarth, Kennedy had managed to\ngain the lead but threw it away up the last\nbeat. Imperial finally scraped home with a narrowly winning 2, 3, 5 combination.\nIn the second race a hasty gybe by Kennedy\nwhen being sailed away from the windward\nmark levelled his capsize score with Jones.\nBut the team did not give up and even with\nthis handicap managed to herd off Bristol's attack, and seemed set to take the match.\nHowever discrepancy over where the finishing line was resulted in are sail being\ndemanded by Bristol. In true sportsman\nfashion Imperial obliged, and it was in this\nrace disaster struck. Jones lost his toes traps up the first beat. Howarth broke his rudder.\nAnd Kennedy demonstrated the art of leaving\na boat on full plane. It was then our turn to\nclaim are sail as a result of gear failure\u2014an\nevent scheduled for tomorrow at Exeter.\nImperial then beat London Hospital 2-0\nwith 1st,2 nd and 3rd positions in both races.\nWatch out Bristol\u2014Imperial take no\nprisoners!\nThis was an exceptional week for the club, as\nall the teams put in great performances.\nTeam 1, although losing gave Met Police 1\na good run for their money, a fact belied by\nthe wide margin of victory, 8-1, to the Met.\nTeam 3 sustained their good run by\nwinning their fourth match in succession.\nThis was despite a poor performance by\nGraeme Cant who showed no initiative in his-play. However he has been working on his\ngame and he assures me that the next match\nwill see a new player.\nTeam 4 won! Travelling to Rejects 4, Steve\nCesbruslais, Brian Norminton and Kevin\nfucK oen expected a hard match. Thanks to\nSteve who won all his and a good\nperformance from Brian, the team came back\nwith their first three points since the first\nmatch of the season. Let's hope this recovery\nwill be maintained.\nTeam 5 also achieved a remarkable victory,\nbeating Exiles 8, currently second in Division\n6. Thanks to Erica Parkes, Mark Cortacans\n(who put in an especially good performance)\nand Phil Miln for rounding off the week with\na flourish.\nYes folks, everyone's at it. Play FELIX Bingo every week in your fun, fun FELIX.\nT Basketball\nICBB vs St Marys won 86-69\nIC have once again shaken the foundations ot\nthe London Colleges League by inflicting\nupon St Marys their first defeat. (They're not\nvery c huffed!) Imperial, arriving in style by cab, had only\nseven men including latest recruit, American\nWalter 'the dude' Morgan, who was to play a. vital role in motivating the team. There was\ndoubt that the match would go ahead since\nonly one ref had turned up.\nWhen we eventually tipped-off the scoring\nwas pretty even with Marys two big men\ntaking most of their points from inside moves\n\u2022 and rebounds whilst many of Imperial's points came from Walter's excellent drives to\nshoot or dump off to Panos for a shot.\nTop scorer was Panos with 28 markers.\nIC vs London Hospital\nMen's team: IC 47, LH50\nWomen's team: IC 20, LH10\nAlthougn t ne competition was really a 'friendly' it produced some good judo. The\nmen's competition was closely fought, with\nthis year's beginners doing very well, but we\nnarrowly lost, probably due to Graham's absence at the competition (but not in the bar\nafterwards). The women's team did better, of\ncourse, with good performances from all\nmembers, especially beginner, Sarah.- A good\nevening was had in the bar afterwards with a promise of a return visit to London Hospital\nin the near future.\nThe club still meets for a good punch up on\nTuesdays and to practise techniques on\nThursdays, both at 6:30pm in the Union\nGym, and old and new members are\nwelcome.\nCourtman Shield\nC&G770, RCS 756, RS M538 One .<of ICRPC's most important internal\ncompetitions was held last Wednesday, and\nwon, resoundingly by Guilds led by Steve\nHarrison. The competition required each\nC CU to field five small bore rifle shots, so this\nput RS M at a substantial disadvantage since\nthey could only produce three\u2014and one of\nthose wasn'ta student! Bowser (C&G) and\nHiggs (RCS) hit the highest score of L96 ex\n200, closely followed by Harrison with 194.\nHowever the result was determined by total\nlack of coolness by the RCS team\u2014problems\nwith match nerves and inability to read a digital watch correctly by their less experienced marksmen led to their downfall.\nThere are still two more inter-CCU\nmatches. The pistol competition is on 15 Feb,\nand f he full bore rifle match at Bisley is on 18\nMarch. Will RCS gain revenge for their\ncrushing defeat? Will Mines ever get a team\ntogether?

Sorry about\nthe publicity so far...let's hope it's better from\nnow on.\nWednesday, of course, was the fabled 'first\nouting' where we all got to see each other\nmaking fools of ourselves in the docks behind\nMr Taunton-Fenton's boat. It all goes to\nprove that you don't need anything but\nenthusiasm to get started. Within a couple of\nweeks we hope to fit an 'edge bar' to the boat.\nIt sort of hangs over the side and makes it\neasier to start off.

    "content": "Reviews]\nThe exhibition begins with a potted history of Holography and\nits development from its invention in 1948 to the present day\nwith examples of the early\nholograms. There is then a simple yet clear explanation of\nholography and the way in which\ndifferent types of holograms are\nproduced. The most interesting\npart of the exhibition (and the\npart most people come to see) is\nthe holographic art gallery.\nThere is a great deal of resistance\nwithin the art world to accepting\nholograms as an art form. The\nargument is that creative control\nin the production of a hologram is\n, limited, any spectacular results\nare obtained through accident\nrather than design. Holographic\nart is as yet in its infancy the\nworks on display at the ex hb it ion though fascinating and spectacular could not really be\ndescribed as masterpieces.\nHowever the works do illustrate\nthe potential of holographic art,\nmaking use of colour, form and\nmovement simultaneously in a manner which has not been\npossible with any other medium.\nEves Crystal I and II by\nLinda Law both display\ngeometric crystal ive structures,\nbathed in an intense, almost\nhypnotic green laser light.\nA hologram differs somewhat\nfrom a picture or slide in that\neach point in the hologram\ncontains the whole image. If you\ncut a piece off a hologram, you\ncan still see the whole image-only the definition is reduced.\nThis makes the hologram a very\nuseful medium for storing data,\nsuch as text, compared to\nmicrofilm, as minor damage\ndoes not cause any loss of\ninformation.\nIntcrferometry\nAt present, one of the most\nimportant applications is inter-fe rome try. A double holographic\nexposure of the object while\nstressed and unstressed shows\nlight and dark bands which\ncluster together near potential\nfractures. The technique has\nbeen applied to nuclear fuel\nrods, loudspeaker cones, the\nliving human body, car tyres and\na host of engineering structures.\nIt is even possible to see shock\nwaves in the air due to the\npassage of high velocity bullets.\nOf course, for such applications,\nvery fast exposures are needed,\nbut lasers can supply pulses\nshorter than a picosecond (a million-millionth of a second) so\nthere is no problem.\nDennis Gabor, who lectured at Imperial, discovered holography in 1948. As it required an\nintense, monochromatic light source, it lay dormant until 1960 and the invention of the laser.\nYou can marvel at just how much holography\nhas come on since then if you visit the Light\nDimensions Exhibition in the Science Museum.\nAlso, on Level 4, Sherfield, there is an exhibition of the life and work of Dennis Gabor, who\ndied in 1979.\nOne of the problems with\ndisplaying holograms is th ta unless your eye is within the\ncorrect angle of view you cannot\nsee the image. Tucked away in\nthe corner of the exhibition are a series of three holograms of the\ncrucifixion of Christ which uses\nthis drawback very effectively.\nThe portraits seemingly jump out\nat you, one after another as you\npass them.\n12 Milliwatt boogie by\nRudie Barkhout is a very\ningenious white light transmission hologram. The holographic\nplate has had several images\nexposed to different parts of it\nsuch that the image changes as\nyour eye moves across the plate,\nproviding a shifting kaleidoscope\nof colour and shape. The artist\nRudie Berkhout says about is\nwork that he regards the viewer\nas a needle of a record player\nplaying a hologram.\nThere are over 100 spectacular holograms by artists from all\nover the world. The exhibition is\nopen seven days a week until 29\nApril. You would be better to go\nduring a Weekday as the\nexhibition is jam packed during\nweekends. It is excellent value at\n\u00a31 for students (\u00a31.75 otherwise)\nand is a must for anyone interest\nin holography.\nArt and Restoration\nIn the Soviet Union, holograms\nare taken of priceless art\ntreasures, so that Soviet citizens\nfrom Kiev to Vladivostock can\nvisit travelling hologram shows\nof their national heritage. When\nrestoring paintings, it is useful to\nknow if any areas of paint are\nlikely to chip and fall off. By\ntaking a double exposure and\nwarming the painting up by a few degrees between exposures,\nthe weak spots in the paint can\nbe easily and safely identified.\nAdvertising\nHolograms can be made to\n'come out' of the plane of the\nholographic plate and the effect\nis so convincing that people\nare willing to make fools of\nthemselves walking around the\nimage and trying to touch it.\nThis is very useful for advertising\nand also for displaying objects\ntemporarily, for instance at\nexhibitions, when the objects\nare too large or fragile to\ntransport easily.\nPortraits\nHolographic portraiture is very\nsuccessful and uncannily lifelike.\nThere were initial problems due\nto the fact that a living subject\nhas blood moving under the skin\nand this motion destroys the\nimage. Ultrashort laser pulses\novercame this. Also, enlarged\npupils due to sitting in the dark\nare prevented by shining a bright light at the subject before\nthe exposure.\nOptics\nThere are an enormous number\nof applications in the field of\noptics, for instance, head-up\ndisplays for pilots attract a lot of\nmilitary funding. Also, optical\nelements such as lenses can be\nmade from holograms. (There is\neven some hope of making\nholographic contact lenses.) Dr\nRobin Smith of the physics\ndepartment designs holographic\nmicroscope objectives and there\nis much activity in holography in\nthe department's Coherent Optics group.\n\n"

    "content": "NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION\nACADEMICS TO TAKE STUDENT FLATS\nThe two student flats on the Southside Penthouse level are to be returned\nto academic staff warden occupation after just five terms as student\nresidences. The decision is amongst a number of controversial moves\ncontained in a College notice on The Management of Student Residence\nissued by College Secretary John Smith. The notice is the end result of\nthe Report on Student Residence at the College by Mr John Lauwerys\nSenior Assistant Secretary, published in February last year.\nAlso in the notice is confirm a pastoral, social and disciplinary\ntion that the College is to acquire\nan additional 125 places in\nCollege-owned residences. There\nare a number of properties under\nconsideration, including some\nadditional houses in Evelyn\nGardens. These additional places\nare necessary to keep the total\nnumber of places over the target\nof 2,000 with the loss of some\nplaces in head tenancies.\nThe management of residences\nis to get a shake-up as well, the\nnotice reveals. A new post of\nManaging Surveyor (Residences)\nwill be created to take some of the\nwardens' administrative and\ndomestic workload, for example\ncontrol of cleaning and main ten ance. Mr Peter Hallworth,\npresently a surveyor irl Estates,\nhas already been appointed to the\nnew post. This new post conforms largely with the recommendations of the Lauwerys\nreport, and is designed to enable\nwardens to 'concentrate on their\nroles'.\nThe financing of residence is\nalso considered in the notice. It\nseems that more effort is to be\nmade To separately identify costs\nof residence and charge them to\nthe residence account. This includes the cost of security patrols\nand services such as heating and\nlighting. This is likely to result in\nhigher rents or less money being\nspent on residences.\nThe power of the student\nresidence committee is also to be\nreduced to that of an advisory\ncommittee rather than a policy-making one. This is generally\nbelieved to be a way of reducing\nthe blocking power of wardens,\nwho have in the past t> een\nsuccessful in frustrating College\nand Union plans for changes in\nthe running of the residences.\nTwo years ago the College\ntook a decision to reduce the\nnumber of wardens in Southside\nfrom four to two as an economy\nmeasure, and to use the two\nvacant wardens' flats for student\naccommodation. This resulted in\neach Southside warden being in\ncharge of two of the four 'halls'\nwhich make up Southside. This\nmove was strongly opposed at the\ntime by the wardens themselves\nand some Southside residents\nwhose warden was being removed from the job. It is\ncommon knowledge that the two\nremaining Southside wardens,\nDr Paul Jowitt and Dr Henry\nHutchinson, were opposed to\nhaving students as neighbours on\nthe Penthouse level. This resulted\nin a term's delay in getting\nstudents in the vacant flats whilst\nwrangling went on about the\nconditions to be imposed on\nresidents.\nThe latest decision represents a complete change of direction in\nCollege policy and amounts to an\nadmission that John Smith now\nbelieves the earlier decision to\nreduce the number of wardens\nwas a mistake. The real reason for\nMr Smith's change of mind on\nthis issue may well be pressure\nfrom Mews residents who complain about lack of discipline in\nSouthside. The appointment of\nanother two wardens may well be\nJohn Smith.\nseen as a concession to them.\nAlthough it has been decided\nto put two extra wardens in\nSouthside it has apparently not\nyet been decided which residences they will be in charge of. It\nis possible that there will be a reversion to the previous situation in Southside with four'halls'\neach with its own warden. But\nJohn Smith told FELIX that\nconsideration would be given to\nputting the new wardens resident\nin Southside in charge of other\nproperties such as Evelyn Gdns,\nMontpelier Street or unspecified\nnew residences which the College\nis hoping to acquire. The most\nlikely of these new properties is\nCadogan Court, situated bet we en Queens gate and Gloucester Road.\nSee Editorial for comment.\nShields Returned Q What do Mike Stuart's head and the site of the missing\nshield have in common?

    "content": "Residence Policy\nCollege Secretary Mr John Smith emphasised at the time that the purpose of the\nLauwreys report was merely to provide a focus for discussion and debate over the\nfuture of student residences and that any policy would only be implemented after\ncomments were received from those concerned. There were a number of serious\nreservations about the report voiced not only by the students union but the\nwardens and other people concerned with student residence as well. Mr Smith has\nignored most of the reservations voiced by the students union at the time and\ngone right ahead and implemented the policy.\nThe policy creates the post of a Superwarden (called a Managing Surveyor\n(Residence)) who will be responsible for, main tan en ce and cleaning and will be the\ndirect superior to the Hall housekeepers.\nThis will make the role of Southside Wardens (who do little enough as it is)\nsuperfluous. The managing surveyor and the Student Services Officer will not be\naccountable to the Student Residence Committee: which has student represent a tion, but to the College Secretary directly. Another decision which goes totally\nagainst what the Union has been pressing for concerns the issue of Southside\nWardens. Despite the fact that two years ago the Student Residence Committee\nfelt that the number of Wardens in the Southside Halls of Residence should be\nreduced from four to two. Mr Smith has decided he knows better and now all four\nPenthouse flats will be occupied by staff wardens. The reason given in the policy\ndocument is laughable:\n'...opportunities for undergraduates in particular to meet acca demi c staff have\ndiminished. It is therefore proposed to reinstate the two Southside flats for academic\nstaff wardens.'\nWhat a load of bollocks! The real reason of course is that the Wardens hate\nhaving students as neighbours.\nA draft of the policy was sent to Gaynor Lewis last week. She was asked for a response within three days. This did not leave her time to consult student opinion\nadequately or to formulate a well thought out response. Nevertheless she\nexpressed a number of reservations most of which were totally ignored. MrSmith\nhas ignored most of the discussion arising from the Lauwreys report and gone\nahead and one what he wanted to in the first place. It seems as if there is little\npoint in having a Student Residence Committee or any kind of student representation in College when comment on an issue as important to students as\nresidence is just brushed aside. Gaynor is going to face her toughest test as\nPresident so far. Just as John Smith unilaterally implemented residence policy\novernight Gaynor is going to have to (and I'm sure she will) tell College that until\nthere is further discussion and proper consultation as far as the Union is\nconcerned this document is not policy.\nEducation Cuts\nPeter Brooke will be speaking at Imperial College next Thursday lunch time. Mr Brooke is not only our constituency MP, he is also the Minister responsible for\nHigher Education. He ultimately decides the amount you get for your grant, the\nlevel of government funding universities recieve and the number of students able\nto enter higher education in future years. This man directly affects the life style of\nstudents and the standard of living so it is important that IC students go to the\nmeeting and make their opinion known. The talk will be at 1:00pm in Huxley 340\non Thursday 16 Feb.\nFree Love In FELIX\nSpeed your love to me, or anyone else you fancy, via the Valentine's edition of\nFELIX small ads next Friday. Only three days late but its better to have been\nloved and late than never been loved at all. Pallab Ghosh\nCUL Invade Primelia College\nI was down at Primelia College last Thursday, and\nwent to a lecture in the morning. Midway through it,\na group from CUL bombarded us with flour and\neggs. They left after about half a minute, and while\nwe were busy making pancakes from the resulting\nmess, they went off to steal some shields.\nFour of them, Alan, Barry, Chris and Dave,\nreached the Mech Eng department, and between\nthem took sixteen shields. No two took the same\nnumber, Dave taking the most, Chris next, then\nBarry and finally Alan who took least of all. As they\nwere escaping, they were stopped by a policeman\nwho asked them in turn if they knew how many each\nof the other three had taken, given that they knew\nhow many they had themselves.\n'No,\n'No,\n'No,\n'No,\n'No,\n'No,\nsaid Alan,\nsaid Barry,\nsaid Chris,\nsaid Dave,\nsaid Alan\nsaid Barry.\nAssuming that each of them had made all possible\ndeductions before they spoke and that Chris had\ntwo more shields than Barry, how many did each of\nthem have?\nGood luck, everyone.\nSolutions, comments, criticisms to me at the\nFELIX Office by 1:00pm on Wednesday please. \u00a35\nfrom Mend-a Bike for the randomly selected winner.\nLast Week's Solution\nThe first two figures of each number give the position of the letter in the alphabet, ie A=01,B=02, etc.\nThe second two figures give the position of that\nletter in the complete solution (ie there are fifty-one\nletters and spaces in the solution).\nTherefore, the message reads 'The mole had been\nworking very hard all the morning,' which is the first\nline from Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows.\nOf thirteen solutions, Neil Thornton of Maths 1 was\nthe randomly selected winner, and can collect his\ncheque for \u00a35 from the FELIX Office after 1:30pm on\nMonday.\nThanks, Perola.\nIf anyone has any ideas for puzzles, would they\nplease put them in my box in the FELIX Office along\nwith the solution and a pseudonym.\nMany people seem to be under the misapprehension that the weekly \u00a35 prize entitles them to \u00a35 off\npurchases or servicing at Mend-a Bike.

    "content": "Feature\n5 . EDUCATION CUTS: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE The story so far\nThe system of higher education in\nthis country has largely evolved\nhand-in-hand with the industrial\nand economic expansion which\nfollowed the last war. In 1963. the\ninfluential Robbins Reports was\npublished, with the conclusion\nthat there should be open access\nto Higher Education for all those\nwith two or more A Level passes.\nIn order to cater for growing\npopular demand, therefore, the\nUniversity system was subsequently expanded and. later, the\nPolytechnics were developed.\nThis growth continued up until\nthe mid-1970s. In 1980/1 Government cutbacks in public expenditure\nfinally hit the Higher Education\nsector with aven e gence. Cuts in\nthe Universities averaging 15%\nover the period 1981-4 were\nannounced. These cuts were\nadministered by the University\nGrants Committee (UGC), who\nwere widely criticised at the time\nfor acting hastily and without\nsufficient consultation when deciding where the cuts were to fall.\nThe most obvious effects of the\nUGC cuts were reductions in\nstudent numbers and staffing\nwithin the Universities, although\nthere is little doubt that teaching\nand research have also suffered.\nDespite cuts in the number of\nstudents entering the Universities, the intake of students into\nthe Polytechnics increased, and\nthe last Conservative government\nwas able to say that, because the\nproportion of eighteen-year-olds\ntaking degree courses had grown,\nthe 'Robbins principle' of open\naccess had not been breached.\nUnfortunately, Polytechnic funding did not increase in line with\nthe expanded intake. This meant\nthat in many cases resources were\nstrained to such an extent that\nstudents were being very much\n'mass produced', consequently\nreceiving an inferior quality of\neducation.\nThe National Advisory Body\nIn 1981 the National Advisory\nBody (NAB) was set up to advise\nthe Government on the distribution of funding for the Public\nSector of Higher Educaton. The\npublic sector consists of the\nPolytechnics and Further Education colleges, which are administered and funded by Local\nEducation Authorities, and a variety of 'special' colleges.\nThe N AB's short-term aim was\nto advise on provision for the\npublic sector for 1984-5 in the\nIn the final article of his series, Peter Burt writes\nabout and comments on the wider issue of Higher\nEducation cuts as a preliminary to the speaker meeting\norganised by the Conservative Society next Thursday\nPeter Brooke, Under Secretary of State f or Higher\nEducation, will be speaking about the UGC question-n aire. light of an overall 10% cut in\nfunding. Sir Keith Joseph, Secretary of State for Education, has\nrecently accepted the NAB recommendations, which will\nmean the closure of several\ninstitutions and courses and\ninitiate a trend towards the\ncentralisation of Higher Education. Nevertheless, the Polytechnics and Colleges will be expected\nto continue increasing their student intake. Despite decreasing\nnumbers of part-time students\nand a \u00a320m 'top-up', the unit of\nresource per student from the\ncentral pool of money will drop\nstill further. Local Authorities,\nwho in the past were able to\nprovide extra money from their\nbudgets for Further Education;\nalso face strict spending limits\nand are unwilling to increase\ntheir contributions. This means,\nin all probability, even bigger\nclasses with poor teaching. To\nquote an extreme example, the\nNorth East London Polytechnic\nwill have to declare at least 125\nacademics redundant by the end\nof the year in order to comply\nwith NAB recommendations.\nIt appears, that from now on,\nstudents entering polytechnics\nare destined to receive a second-class education.\nLong Term Planning\nSir Keith Joseph has recently\nasked for debate to be opened on\nthe issues that face Higher\nEducation over the next ten years\nin order to formulate a long-term\nstrategy for the future of the\nsector. For this reason the NAB has initiated a consultation with\nthe Polytechnics and Colleges\nunder its supervision, and is\ncurrently processing the replies to\nthis consultation. Towards the\nend of last year the UGC sent out\nits now famous '28 questions'\nletter and opened a similar debate\nwithin the Universities.\nSuch debate has been long\noverdue, and the outcome will\nhave profound effects in subsequent years. The debate provides\na golden opportunity to reform\nour Higher Education system.\nThis is necessary for a variety of\nreasons. For instance, public\nconfidence in the present system\nis not high. It is also necessary to\nredefine the 'Robbins principle'\nof access to Higher Education if\npeople with suitable ability but\nwithout formal qualifications are\nto be offered places on courses.\nThe need for reform has not\nprevented severe criticism of, in\nparticular, the UGC consult a tion, since the emphasis within\ntheir questionnaire is placed\nheavily on financial and economic issues rather than on the\nsocial purposes of education.\nUniversities are asked what\n--changes they would make over\nthe period from the present until\n1989/90 on the basis of steady\nfunding and alternatively on the\nbasis of a1 or 2% cut in the unit\nof resource per student every year\nover this period. This follows\nsuggestions from Sir Keith\nJoseph that cuts in the order of 5-10% in University cash over the\nnext five years may well be\nnecessary in order to reach public\nexpenditure targets, although he\nemphasizes that the Government\nhas no present intention to\nimplement any such cuts. This is\nscant consolation to the Universities, who already consider\nthemselves to be receiving the\nminimum amount of money\nrequired to maintain academic\nstandards and who were told at\nthe lime of the 1981 cuts that they would face no further reduction\nm funding.\nThe UCiC questionnaire also\nasks tor comments on a wide\nrange of related issues. These\ninclude possibilities of lessening\ndependence on public funds and\nfor shifting emphasis away from\nthe Humanities and towards\ntechnical and scientific subjects.\nQuestions are also asked about\nthe nature of the 'binary divide'\nbetween Universities and Polytechnics and about the feasibility\nof divorcing research from teaching within the sector. Issues of\nparticular relevance to students\nare raised, such as the possibility\nof reducing degree lengths to two\nyears and the possibility of\nintroducing courses allowing\n'conversion' between Arts and\nScience subjects.\nIndividuals and interest groups\nwithin Colleges have been asked\nto put forward their own views in\norder to make the debate as wide-ranging as possible. However, it\nis set within the constraints of the\ncurrent political thinking that\neducation is an expensive millstone around the neck of the\neconomy and that it should\ntherefore be provided on utilitarian grounds alone.\nSPRING TERM TIME\nTABLE OF EVENTS\nThursday 16th February l pm Huxley 340, Peter Brooke, IC's constituency MP and government minister responsible for\nHigher Education, will be speaking as a guest of Consoc.\nThursday 23 February, NUS Day\nof Action The 'day of action' will\nhopefully take place in countries\nthroughout Western Europe in\norder to protect education.\nTuesday 6 March, l pm Mech Eng\n220, Professor Alan Swanson,\nPro-Rector, will be speaking on\nthe response of Imperial College\nto the UGC's recent '28 Questions' as part of the Humanities\nDept lu r. r'n time schedule.\nSaturday 10 March National\nDemonstration, London.

    "content": "WRITE REPLY Anti-porn campaigner Michael\nNewman writes in reply to some\nof the criticisms levelled against\nhim for his recent actions.\nOpinion\nIn My Defence\n'Hush, ssh hh, no one's to know, it\nwouldn't do our College any good.\nKeep it quiet. Girls won't want to come\nhere. Must not tell anyone. Give our\nCollege a bad name. I mean it's OK,\nisn't it, as long as it's not noticed.'\nIt seems that in my College, in my Union it\nis alright to tell people about our academic\nsuccesses, our sports successes, our Rag stunt\nsuccesses, our Union policy on grants,\neducation, NUS,S Africa, refectory meals\nbut not on pornography. We must act deaf,\ndumb and blind on this College issue.\nIt may surprise many of you but Imperial\nCollege Union has policy admitting that\nR SMU holds, organises and profits from\nhard-core pornographic events. Not only\nthat, our Union also condemns any society,\nclub or constituent union holding such\nevents. It was Gaynor Lewis'job to inform all\nImperial College students and staff of this\nand to inform the University of London\nUnion.\n'It's OK. I mean I would never go to\nsuch events. Oh, yes I find porn\ndistasteful. It's not my cup of tea. I wouldn't stop anyone-else from going.\nOf course we mustn't tell anyone that\nit happens here. I mean that could\ndamage the reputation of the College.'\nIf you have read the motions I proposed, if\nyou have read the articles I have written, if\nyou have ever listened to me speak you will\nknow that I do not support banning people\ngoing to pornographic events or buying\nrr no graphic material. 1 feel it is and should\nremain our right to do so. I want it as a right\nas much as anyone else.\nYet pornography is dangerous, hard-core\npornography is sick. It portrays women as\nsows to be fucked by pigs; as bitches to be\nfucked by dogs; as bodies to be penetrated by-crosses, bottles and pricks; as bodies to be hit,\nheld down, chained and whipped. It degrades\nall of us, especially women, and even those so\nignorant they ll o not understand or, worse do\nnot care.\n'Look I do not feel degraded, let\nthose who enjoy it go to such events. It\nis only once a year in College. If I do\nnot go then it's nothing to do with me.\nLeave them in peace, it's only a bit of\nfun after all.' I expect a large number of students buy\npornographic magazines. I expect they gaze\nat them, fantasize and satisfy their sexual\narousal by masturbation. Indeed I include\nmyself in this group, though I am not proud\nto do so.\nMy attitude to girls can often be one of\ndegradation. I sometimes see them only as\nbodies to be leered at, as sexual objects, as\nprizes to be won and fucked.\nI do not want to degrade people. Attitudes\nthat I have had (since going to an all boys'\nschool) for most of my educated life, are\ndifficult to change.\nI am a potential rapist. One day I could see\na beautiful body wearing erotic clothes and\nignore the screams, ignore the scratching and\nkicking. What right has a sexual object to say\nno? After all her whole purpose and function\nis sex.\nI do not support or want to encourage my\nattitude. Should we all allow our Union to?\n'That Michael Newman, he wants to\nenforce his moral code on everyone\nelse. The arrogant moralist. Thinks he\nhas the right to say what we should and\nshould not do.'\nI have no power to enforce my morals on\nanyone, even if I should wish to. All I can do\nis to make students aware of what their Union\nis doing and understand the difference\nbetween supporting freedom and organising,\nholding and profiting from events involving\nhard-core pornography and strippers. Within\nthe democracy of the Union we can then\ndecide upon Union policy.\n'Just because he has lost, just\nbecause democracy has failed he goes\nto the press to exert external pressure\non College to ban Hon Porn Night.'\nI have not lost. My intent was simply to\ncreate debate, to force students to make a conscious decision, whether they wanted\npornographic events in their College, organised within their Union, or not. I still believe\nthey do not. In the end if anyone has lost it is\nall of us, it is the Union.\nDemocracy has not failed. We, as members\nof our Union, have decided by voting or\nthrough apathy that our Union should allow\nthe pornographic events to continue. One\nthing I have always been taught is that you\nshould accept the responsibility for your\ndecisions and actions. It is a pity many\nstudents seem to have for gott on this.\nHow can anyone blame me if people\nchoose not to come here because of the Union\npolicy and the events it organises? Aftecall\nout of all the students in College I have tried\nmore than any other to change the policy.\nYou should look more to yourselves.\n'RSMU organises many social\nevents during the year. They contribute greatly to the cultural life of the\nCollege. Why attack them?'\nMy campaign, unlike my opponents, has\nnever involved personal attacks or abuse. It\nhas not even primarily been an attack on\nMines, I have merely criticized the two events\nthey organise that involve pornography and\nstrippers. R SMU might in many ways be a good Union, yet does this in some way make\nHon Porn Night acceptable?\nChris Crownshaw thinks if he tells people\nwhat a great president he is, what a great\nunion R SMU is, what great events they put on\nthat magically Hon Porn Night will be\nforgotten. It seems that if degrading women is\nonly a small part of their calendar then it's 'all\nOK with us boys'.\n'Michael Newman should be sued for\ndefamation of character. How dare he\ncall us pimps.'\nHow dare we allow our Union to profit\nfrom hard-core pornographic entertainment,\nfrom films that are the product solely of\nprostitution. How dare we allow our Union\nto solicit for prostitutes by advertising their\nservices and wares on film. .\nI think we are all pimps. This is not an\ninsult, it is not meant to degrade, it is simply a term that can be correctly used to describe\none of our Union's activities.\nIndeed we are far worse than pimps.! think\nmy motion does not go far enough. Foi we\nare allowing our Union to actively degrade\npeople. To supp port the mental rape, torture\nand destruction of human beings. We are\ncontributing to the suffering of the victims of\nrape, sexual exploitation, pornography and\nprostitution.\n'Michael Newman is a bastard, a poof, a stupid prick.'\nIf you could have listened to some of the\nabuse I have been given, the way I have been\ninsulted and degraded, I feel 1 would not just\nhave your sympathy but also your support. I am human. You are human. All women are\nhuman. Please let's not forget it.\nFELIX II Friday, February 10, 1984 ' Page 7\n\n"
