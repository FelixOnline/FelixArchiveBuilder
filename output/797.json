    "content": "FELIX\nSo Nigel Baker is next year's President. As he was the only\nserious candidate to stand, this is\nnot at all surprising.

It's very hard\nfor me to describe this 'spirit' to any\nperson who hasn't been a staff\nmember. It is the 'getting-FELIX-out-on-a Friday-whatever-happens'\nspirit. It's all about caring for the\nPaper and its future. It's when you\nmay have more interesting things to\ndo, like drink in the bar with your\nmates, but the Paper needs folding\nand collating, so you stay and help.\nIt's about defending editorial\nfreedom.

    "content": "News Heroic Mark saves lives in Wales\nSeveral members of Canoe Club\nwould have nearly drowned off the\nGower Peninsula last weekend, had\nit not been for the quick thinking of\nMark Jones, one of the more\nexperienced members of the Club.\nThe Club were on a canoe-surfing\ntrip to Rhosilli in Wales for the\nweekend. On Sunday the tide was\ngoing out when the club wanted to\nsurf. There was an onshore breeze,\nbut the waves were fairly small,\nsuggesting safe conditions. President\nNigel Eatough, who was supervising\nsafety, left the beach but did not\ndesignate someone else to take on his\nresponsibility. When one of the\nmembers, Martin Love, capsized, he\nwas unable to hang on to his canoe\ndue to the water conditions. When Mr\nJones saw what had happened he\nmanaged to reach him and pull him\nback to shore. Near the beach Canoe\nClub Secretary Jenny Ramsey, who\nhad walked into the sea to help\nMartin, got into difficulties herself\nwhen pushed into deeper water by\nwaves. A group of canoeists\ndecided to carry on surfing, again\nwith no-one in charge. At one point\nall three of the canoeists on the sea\n(Kevin Powell in a single, Andrew\nHaslem and Chris Home in a double)\ncapsized and rapidly drifted out of\nreach of their craft. Fortunately Mark\nJones was also in a canoe and was\nable to help them as well.\nAt first sight it appeared to the two\nin the double that Kevin Powell was\ntrapped under his canoe. However, it\nsoon became clear that the canoe was\nempty, as it was rolling un weighted. Mark Jones first went to rescue the\npair, pulling one of them back onto\nthe double with difficulty due to the\nwind and unusual currents. Whilst\npulling in the empty canoe Mark\nhimself capsized but managed to roll\nback over. However, had he been in\ndifficulty, there would not have been\nanyone to rescue him.\nAfter the ordeal, everyone had put\non dry clothes and sweet, milky tea\nwas distributed to calm nerves. At\nleast two people were suffering from\nmild shock.\nEventually Nigel appeared and was\ntold of the events. Mark Jones\ncommented later: \"Nigel implied it\nwas the groups' fault\". This was\ndespite the fact that the President had\nhad difficulties himself in righting his\ncanoe after capsizing.\nChris Home, one of the students\n*2fJ h BEAN'S CLUB\nproudly present the\nELECTION\nRESULTS PARTY\nCome along and get plastered with\nthe candidates, proposer s, hangers-on and nobodies\nFree tickets from Shan in the FELIX\nOffice, lunchtime today\nMark Jones\nwho capsized said that it was \"a group of strong canoeists caught out\nby unexpectedly strong currents\" and\nthat in future even more care would\nbe taken to ensure canoeing only took\nplace in safe conditions. He described\nNigel Eatough as \"a well-meaning\nguy who just hadn't had experience\nof these conditions\".\nClub Secretary Jenny Ramsey told\nFELIX yesterday: 'We don't want it\nto put people off the Club.'\nC&G fiasco\nThe City & Guilds Union Executive\nelections have had to be postponed\nuntil the last week of this term\nbecause both presidential candidates\nhave pulled out. Both Chris Stapleton\n(Aero) and Neil Smith (Mech Eng)\nwithdrew after the electoral papers\nhad gone down. Due to the Guilds\nsystem of electing their President,\nVice-President (VP) and Honorary\nSecretary, the three elections have had\nto be re-run in order that losers of the\nPresidential election may step down\nto the VP or Hon Sec elections.\nAt the Hustings Union General\nMeeting (part one) yesterday, David\nOsborne was ratified as Honorary\nJunior Treasurer. The unopposed\ncandidate for Academic Affairs\nOfficer did not turn up to the meeting\nand therefore could not be ratified.\nSmall Ads ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\u2022 Experienced, versatile lead guitarist\nseeks band/other like-minded m usos.

    "content": "FELIX THE BARON Derek hurried along the walkway, huddling to protect himself from the biting wind. It was just past midnight\nand Derek was returning from the Cheapskate dormitories after checking that all the Citizen's were safely\ntucked into bed (their own beds!) and that lights were out.\nAs he went along Derek looked at all the rubbish stuck to all the walls and said to his wife Mad Dash, 'thank\ngoodness super-Tuesday is over and the citizens have elected their new leaders. I don't think I can stand\nany more of these posters. They are such rubbish, I mean, take this one here'. Derek pointed at a poster and\nread it out.\n'Uninformed, smudgy, faint, inaccurate. 'Cwis Media, no bollocks\u2014just a great Phallix.'\nAnd look at this crap: 'Willhebe Goodforacolumninch\u2014give the cat something to eat.'\nMeanwhile Mad had walked on a bit and found a poster for the last candidate for Phallix Editor.\n'Look at this one, Derek, it's quite funny.'\nDerek read it.\n'Martin Prick\u2014I 've got someone else's briefcase.' \u2022\n'She thinks that's funny', thought Derek, 'oh well, little things please little minds.' (But Derek knew that\nalready.)\nFurther along the walkway Derek found some posters for Citizen's Leader. The very, very serious candidate\nhad very, very boring posters with a very, very silly red slogan; 'Nige D Butcher\u2014hit me with your rhythm\nstick'. The very, very silly candidate had very, very good posters. 'Brendan O 'Spud\u2014vote potato.'\nThe only other poster Derek found was for the new post of Honorary Slave (Parties), it read: 'Austin Morriswrapped around a lamppost'near you.'\nAll these posters had given Derek an excellent idea. Why not make John Secretary and Arthur Michael stand\nfor re-election every year?\nHe started to imagine the sort of posters and slogans they would produce.\n'Arthur Michael\u2014about as useful as a solar powered torch.'\n'John Secretary\u2014about as sincere as a TV evangelist.'\n'This was good fun', thought Derek. 'But what would he do for his own posters? This would be difficult.\nWhich of his many qualities should he emphasise? Gosh, this would be difficult.\nHow about: 'Citizens shall not live by McNorthey kebabs alone but by every memo that proceeds from Derek's desk.' No, too wordy. He needed a sharp, punchy slogan. Let's try. 'Derek, The Baron'. Nope, too short.\nIt needed a little more content. Derek went home and rang up his chief yes man, lain Bore,\n'lain', he said, 'I need a slogan', 'Yes, Baron', said Bore grovelling ly. 'What sort?'\n'A clever, witty one, not too short,\nnot too long, just the right length.'\nlain though for a split second, then\ncame out with: 'Derek Dash: the\ncitizens wouldn't give a XXXX for\nany other Baron.'\n'That's brilliant, just what I want,\nthanks lain. Goodnight.'\nMeanwhile, in the citizen's building, Chas Takeiteasy was\ngetting dressed up into his dinner suit\nfor the big event of the year\u2014the\nCheapskate awards. He left his office\nand went into the citizen's theatre.\nAfter the applause died down he\nstepped up to the microphone.\n'Ladies, gentlemen and those who\naren't quite sure, welcome to the\n1988 Cheapskate awards. The first\npresentation is for Citizen's Leader,\nand to present this prize here is last\nyear's winner, Mr Sidney Spanker.'\nSpanker took the stage and\nTakeiteasy handed him the little gold\nenvelope. He slit it open, took out the\ncard, and began to speak: 'And the\nresults, in reverse order, are as\nfollows.
